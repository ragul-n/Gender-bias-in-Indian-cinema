1
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:27,865
'So this is the world
which l have created.'

2
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:32,242
'And these are the people
whom l have created.'

3
00:00:33,714 --> 00:00:39,744
'Temple, mosque, church,
gurudwara (Sikh temple).'

4
00:00:40,654 --> 00:00:42,588
'By building such places,
these people..

5
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:44,180
..have actually created me.'

6
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:47,117
'Do you see this?'

7
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:50,592
'l am god whom these people..

8
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:55,795
..are trying to flatter
using different means.'

9
00:00:57,137 --> 00:01:02,268
'Yes. l am god because of
whom this world exists.'

10
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:06,273
'l never commit any mistake.'

11
00:01:07,614 --> 00:01:10,708
'The god whom everybody worships.'

12
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:14,748
'My name resonates everywhere.'

13
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:15,947
Hail!

14
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:21,287
'But if you have all these
virtues.. then you too are god.'

15
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:27,759
'lf you don't have it.. then you
lucky people have been spared.'

16
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:30,201
'You are just human beings.'

17
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:34,734
'My creator, tell me something.'

18
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:37,805
'Why didn't you make
me a human being?'

19
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:44,684
'Oh, god! Why did you make me god?'

20
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:50,884
'Meet him. He is brother Ram.'

21
00:01:51,658 --> 00:01:54,684
'He has a 23500 square-feet shop
in Crawford Market.'

22
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:56,319
'He earns handsomely.'

23
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,593
'But for the veneration tray..'

24
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:01,861
l will give you one rupee later.

25
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:06,968
'god knows why there is always
a shortage of one rupee.'

26
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:11,870
'Here comes another devotee.'

27
00:02:12,779 --> 00:02:13,973
'His name is Rishi Khanna.'

28
00:02:14,614 --> 00:02:17,139
'But he becomes good
only on Saturdays.'

29
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,009
'good like a sage.'

30
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:22,815
'No non-vegetarian, no liquor.'

31
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:25,251
'He drinks water later
in the morning.'

32
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:27,785
Boss, give me a bowl
of oil and a garland.

33
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,726
'First he offers me oil.'

34
00:02:29,796 --> 00:02:30,854
'Why?'

35
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:32,558
'His astrologer said by doing this..

36
00:02:32,632 --> 00:02:36,728
..he will get an admission
for MBA course in USA.'

37
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,298
'good! You will go
a long way ahead.'

38
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:42,672
'Durga More.'

39
00:02:42,976 --> 00:02:44,136
'lnitially, she was temporary.'

40
00:02:44,678 --> 00:02:46,578
'After completing 55 years of life..

41
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:47,977
..she has become a regular.'

42
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:50,581
'Thinking if she spend her
last days worshipping me..

43
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:52,208
..she will go to heaven.'

44
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:54,145
'You will.'

45
00:02:55,689 --> 00:02:57,714
Madam, move! Why are you
standing in the middle?

46
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,588
'Where has he come from?'

47
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:00,884
'There! There!'

48
00:03:00,961 --> 00:03:03,054
'He! He!'

49
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:05,964
'He is Rajendra Dubey.'

50
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,100
'l have still not understood
why l created him.'

51
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:11,660
'He has everything.'

52
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:15,601
'A job, a wife, a house, a family.'

53
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,767
'But for him it's of no use.'

54
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:21,607
'Why? Where are you off to today?'

55
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:23,778
'He is coming here.'

56
00:03:23,884 --> 00:03:26,284
'lf he enters the temple,
he will harass me.'

57
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:27,611
'l will close the temple.'

58
00:03:27,687 --> 00:03:29,120
'Pundit, get up.'

59
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:32,620
'Hurry up! Close the door! Yes!'

60
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:35,991
'And tell everybody
to leave. Hurry up!'

61
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,699
Come on! Come on! Visitation
time is over! Leave!

62
00:03:41,034 --> 00:03:44,902
'Hurry up! He has come! Hurry up!'

63
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,029
Come on please!
- 'Hurry up!'

64
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:48,734
Leave.
- 'Somebody, stop him. Stop him.'

65
00:03:49,576 --> 00:03:50,702
'Yes. Shut the door quickly.'

66
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:51,903
'Shut the door quickly.'

67
00:03:52,012 --> 00:03:54,708
'Thank you, pundit.'

68
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:55,839
Hari Om (Hail Lord)!

69
00:03:55,916 --> 00:03:56,974
'Yes. l will think about it.'

70
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:00,948
'Hey! He is coming
from the rear side!'

71
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:02,921
'Who left the backdoor open?'

72
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:05,581
'Security! Security!'

73
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:08,586
'Where is everybody?'

74
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,696
'Pundit, couldn't you
have locked the door?'

75
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:24,736
'Hail god!'

76
00:04:25,545 --> 00:04:27,843
Hail to you! Hail god! Hail to you!

77
00:04:31,217 --> 00:04:32,275
'Fine!'

78
00:04:35,288 --> 00:04:38,689
ls everything fine?

79
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:42,225
'Till now, everything was fine.
Now you have come.'

80
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:47,059
Why is your door closed whenever
l come to meet you?

81
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,158
'l..'

82
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,726
At times, l feel you don't
want to meet me.

83
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:56,808
No problem. l do come to meet you.

84
00:04:57,577 --> 00:04:59,044
'That's what l regret.'

85
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:02,571
On Wednesday, gupta, Bansal
and Agarwal told me.

86
00:05:03,183 --> 00:05:04,673
They are diamond merchants.

87
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:07,747
Such investments are
no big deal for them.

88
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:11,253
They can make their lives
shine more than diamond.

89
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:13,583
But, no.

90
00:05:15,028 --> 00:05:16,928
Who will explain to them, god?

91
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:18,992
Since day before yesterday l have
been phoning all three of them.

92
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:20,691
They don't answer my call.

93
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,231
Forget hearing about the scheme.

94
00:05:24,604 --> 00:05:25,662
Scheme.

95
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:26,967
'Oh, no!'

96
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:29,607
You remember, don't you? Scheme.

97
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:32,075
Danvriksh scheme. l
had explained to you.

98
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:34,910
'l remember it. Please, don't
start again. Please.'

99
00:05:35,115 --> 00:05:37,709
You forgot. l will tell you again.

100
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:39,611
Look, you don't have to do anything.

101
00:05:39,686 --> 00:05:41,153
You just have to invest
235000 rupees.

102
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,621
And like social service you have
to take up this cause, god.

103
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:46,784
Yes. Friends, relatives, strangers,
acquaintances.

104
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,556
Whomever you meet, you
have to tell them..

105
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:51,824
..the secret of Danvriksh scheme.

106
00:05:52,032 --> 00:05:55,695
That's it. lt's like chanting
your name, god.

107
00:05:55,869 --> 00:05:58,565
On chanting Danvriksh
scheme's name..

108
00:05:58,638 --> 00:06:01,766
..wealth will shower on
you abundantly, god.

109
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:04,967
'l know how wealthy you are.'

110
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:07,570
But look at my Danvriksh scheme.

111
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,979
'No. Spare me.'

112
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:14,250
Sanjay! He is blind, god!

113
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:15,645
No matter how much l motivate him..

114
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:16,780
..it doesn't make any
difference to him.

115
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,520
lt feels as if he is a spy
from an enemy country..

116
00:06:19,592 --> 00:06:23,255
..and he is leading
me to my downfall.

117
00:06:23,997 --> 00:06:25,521
Don't you find it strange?

118
00:06:25,598 --> 00:06:27,259
'lt's very strange.'
- On one side, it's flourishing.

119
00:06:27,534 --> 00:06:28,592
And on the other side
there is nothing.

120
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:31,933
'Rajendra, why don't you leave
this scheme business?'

121
00:06:32,005 --> 00:06:34,633
lt doesn't mean l am asking
something from you.

122
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:38,273
You have given me life.
Your job is over.

123
00:06:38,611 --> 00:06:42,945
Now, it's my turn, god. l will
write my own destiny.

124
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:44,643
'How much more will you write?'

125
00:06:44,718 --> 00:06:46,618
'This is no daily soap serial.'

126
00:06:46,686 --> 00:06:49,211
l don't understand why people
ask things from you.

127
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:50,987
Everybody is asking for something.

128
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:52,547
You are not an ATM.

129
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,683
'Very funny!'

130
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,957
Just support me. Then
see how much l prosper.

131
00:06:59,999 --> 00:07:01,660
Okay, god. Now l will leave.

132
00:07:02,502 --> 00:07:05,699
'Rajendra, reform. There
is still time.'

133
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:08,639
'Why are you ruining
your good life?'

134
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:10,935
'Know the real happiness of life.'

135
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:13,875
l will come again with the
report of my scheme.

136
00:07:14,013 --> 00:07:18,245
Okay, god. - 'Listen. Where are you
going? Try to understand, dear.'

137
00:07:18,585 --> 00:07:19,916
'Why will you come again?'

138
00:07:19,986 --> 00:07:21,851
'give up this scheme business.'

139
00:07:21,921 --> 00:07:23,047
'Where are you going?'

140
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:37,930
Dispel the darkness.

141
00:07:38,004 --> 00:07:41,030
Let the sun into your house.

142
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:44,941
Dispel the darkness.

143
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:47,809
Let the sun into your house.

144
00:07:47,881 --> 00:07:48,939
You!

145
00:07:49,015 --> 00:07:50,642
Why are you prancing around?

146
00:07:50,717 --> 00:07:52,150
l dwell within your heart.

147
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:54,049
Why are you prancing around?

148
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,747
l dwell within your heart.

149
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:59,189
Darkness.

150
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:02,626
Darkness.

151
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:11,502
What is money? lt's an illusion.

152
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:13,095
lt's the shade of a dry tree.

153
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:18,839
The one who gets entrapped,
he regrets a lot.

154
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:22,077
Why are you running after money?

155
00:08:22,148 --> 00:08:23,740
Why are you losing your slumber?

156
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:29,585
You can't understand
this trivial matter.

157
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,651
You!
- Darkness.

158
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:38,219
Darkness.

159
00:08:58,718 --> 00:08:59,707
You!

160
00:09:07,994 --> 00:09:09,825
Your eyes are shut and ears open.

161
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:11,557
You hear but don't see.

162
00:09:11,631 --> 00:09:16,830
The path which you have
chosen is not easy.

163
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,505
This life is simple.

164
00:09:20,573 --> 00:09:22,097
Your heart is jumbled.

165
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,904
You just need a few morsels
to satiate your hunger.

166
00:09:23,977 --> 00:09:27,936
Why do you ask for more?

167
00:09:28,915 --> 00:09:29,973
You!

168
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:33,018
Dispel the darkness.

169
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:36,055
Let the sun into your house.

170
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,682
You!
- Why are you prancing around?

171
00:09:38,758 --> 00:09:40,157
l dwell within your heart.

172
00:09:40,226 --> 00:09:41,989
Why are you prancing around?

173
00:09:42,061 --> 00:09:43,722
l dwell within your heart.

174
00:09:43,796 --> 00:09:47,197
Darkness.

175
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:50,600
Darkness.

176
00:09:50,803 --> 00:09:54,204
Darkness.

177
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,712
Scheme man! Scheme man!

178
00:10:08,788 --> 00:10:09,846
Scheme man has come!

179
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:14,189

Don't worry. l will see you soon.

182
00:10:35,815 --> 00:10:39,251
Yes, tell me. How is work?

183
00:10:39,652 --> 00:10:43,179
Yes, you will understand.

184
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:44,714
No, no, surely.

185
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:46,850
Yes.

186
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:49,019
Hello!

187
00:10:49,762 --> 00:10:50,820

189
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:04,801

190
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,712
Anmol Ratan. You are
working so hard.

191
00:11:17,824 --> 00:11:18,882
Very good!

192
00:11:19,225 --> 00:11:21,125
Very good!

193
00:11:21,794 --> 00:11:25,230
Mr. Chaudhary! You are
working too hard today!

194
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,097
Don't l know?

195
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:36,774
Everybody is pretending to
be busy just to ignore me.

196
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:40,637
Love me! Love me! Say!
- Janak, where were you?

197
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,806
Do you want a partner?
- You are the only one..

198
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:44,144
..who doesn't
pretend to be working.

199
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,944
Love me! Love me! Say!

200
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,847
Rajendra sir! greetings!

201
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:51,714
Boss called me?

202
00:11:53,659 --> 00:11:54,819
Say something new, sir.

203
00:11:55,595 --> 00:11:56,653
You want tea?

204
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,992
You too are talking about the old
stuff. Bring it to the office.

205
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:03,594
Yes! Tell them to relax!
- Oh!

206
00:12:03,669 --> 00:12:04,829
l am going to boss's cabin.

207
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,014
good morning, Mr. Nagpal.

208
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:24,080
Boss has called me.

209
00:12:24,724 --> 00:12:25,782
Shall l go?

210
00:12:26,626 --> 00:12:27,684
Shall l go?

211
00:12:31,764 --> 00:12:32,822
good morning..

212
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:37,160
Where has he gone?

213
00:12:37,236 --> 00:12:39,636
Come, Rajendra.
- good morning, sir.

214
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:41,667
You should have been
here by 9 o'clock.

215
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:43,038
Why? What happened
at 9 o'clock, sir?

216
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:47,109
Nothing. At least people work in
the office when you are there.

217
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:49,639
Handle it for a few days.

218
00:12:51,084 --> 00:12:52,574
Only after my personal
problem is solved..

219
00:12:52,652 --> 00:12:54,984
..will l be able to do anything.

220
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:58,688
Nowadays l can't do any
work in the office.

221
00:12:59,792 --> 00:13:00,850
l can't think of anything.

222
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,018
l can understand.

223
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,121
What does sister-in-law say now?

224
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:07,593
She has served me a legal notice.

225
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,858
Now, why are you calling
her sister-in-law?

226
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:13,530
Until the divorce formalities
are not over..

227
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:16,234
..she will remain my sister-in-law.

228
00:13:16,609 --> 00:13:18,702
Formalities will be over.

229
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,141
l just want Simi's custody.

230
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,276
Come, Janak. Sir, let's have tea.

231
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,710
Thank you!

232
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:30,013
Here.

233
00:13:30,656 --> 00:13:34,285
Do you know? Janak too
liked my scheme a lot.

234
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:37,219
Yes, sir. lt's a wonderful scheme.

235
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:38,722
l too will be a member.

236
00:13:38,798 --> 00:13:41,665
lf this time l were
to get Diwali (festival) bonus..

237
00:13:42,635 --> 00:13:44,125
No, its fine if l get
it on the next Diwali.

238
00:13:46,906 --> 00:13:47,964
Saw that?

239
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,735
The whole world knows the
secret of this treasure.

240
00:13:50,843 --> 00:13:51,901
Now, do hear about my scheme.

241
00:13:51,978 --> 00:13:53,878
Rajendra, today..
- Today there is nothing.

242
00:13:53,946 --> 00:13:55,846
This is what you have been doing
for the past ten years.

243
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:58,110
Hear the scheme once.
l am telling you.

244
00:13:58,184 --> 00:14:00,778
Your life will change. From being a
boss, you will become a King.

245
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:03,047
You couldn't achieve anything.

246
00:14:05,024 --> 00:14:06,082
Look, sir.

247
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,159
Only that man's dreams come
true who dares to dream.

248
00:14:10,263 --> 00:14:11,525
lf Dhirubhai hadn't dreamt then..

249
00:14:11,597 --> 00:14:13,861
..today the world wouldn't
have been in his grasp.

250
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:17,733
Forget about that. Not every
man can be an Ambani.

251
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,632
But we can try.

252
00:14:21,707 --> 00:14:23,902
Fine. We will talk about this
some other time. Okay?

253
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:26,802
Fine. l will..

254
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:33,712
l forgot! Do you have dinner?

255
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:34,844
Don't you?

256
00:14:34,921 --> 00:14:36,718
No. l mean do you go out for dinner?

257
00:14:36,789 --> 00:14:38,620
l have it out every night.

258
00:14:38,691 --> 00:14:41,057
Wow! So tomorrow you will
have dinner with me.

259
00:14:41,127 --> 00:14:42,719
Me, you and Suman, my wife.

260
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:43,853
Tomorrow is my birthday, sir.

261
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:45,794
You are lying!
- What difference does it make?

262
00:14:45,865 --> 00:14:47,230
Tomorrow we will celebrate
my birthday in advance.

263
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:37,006
Oh!

264
00:15:39,652 --> 00:15:40,710
You returned so soon.

265
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,181
What's going on, Suman?

266
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,221
l..

267
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:46,615
Where have you
got these animals from?

268
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:47,817
Look at their faces.

269
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:50,086
go home!
- Come on!

270
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:51,991
Bye!
- go home!

271
00:15:52,565 --> 00:15:54,032
And my shaving cream!

272
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:55,792
go home!

273
00:15:56,636 --> 00:15:57,933
go home and take a bath!

274
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,800
Yes, l will.
- Yes, uncle. l will take a bath.

275
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:00,930
Come on!

276
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:02,165
Leave!

277
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,640
Today, you returned early.

278
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:04,801
My shaving cream.

279
00:16:04,944 --> 00:16:06,639
lt had got over!

280
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:08,612
We are going for shopping.
We will buy a new one.

281
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:11,911
Oh!
- Look at this!

282
00:16:12,518 --> 00:16:14,247
Uncle Chips! Leave!

283
00:16:17,123 --> 00:16:18,181
Come on!

284
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:19,588
Will you take the dish home?
- Sorry!

285
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:20,717
Come on!

286
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:21,884
Bye!

287
00:16:22,528 --> 00:16:24,086
Why do you bring these
animals everyday?

288
00:16:24,163 --> 00:16:26,631
Such sweet children, Raju.
What are you doing?

289
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,192
Sweet children!

290
00:16:29,602 --> 00:16:30,864
Are we going for shopping?
- Now we will have to.

291
00:16:30,936 --> 00:16:32,904
Sure? Sure!

292
00:16:33,005 --> 00:16:37,772
And l will buy contraceptives
so that we never have kids.

293
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,899
We will have this too.
- This is new.

294
00:17:09,975 --> 00:17:11,033
We will have to buy it.
- Yes.

295
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,668
Piddu!

296
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:18,913
Rajendra! My friend!
My life! How are you?

297
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,677
greetings, sister-in-law.
- greetings, Piddu.

298
00:17:21,787 --> 00:17:22,845
Hi, Meenu.
- Hi.

299
00:17:22,922 --> 00:17:24,787
How are you, Meenu?
- l am fine, sister-in-law.

300
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:27,615
Piddu, what's going on?

301
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,587
There is so much tension.

302
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,630
l was planning to hold
discourses on Sunday.

303
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:33,096
At the last moment, the
pundit betrayed me.

304
00:17:33,532 --> 00:17:35,124
Now, l am searching for a
replacement of the pundit.

305
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,259
What do you mean?

306
00:17:38,704 --> 00:17:39,762
Remember?

307
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,807
What a jamboree l had created
during Sharma's discourses!

308
00:17:41,874 --> 00:17:44,035
Yes!
- l completely forgot!

309
00:17:44,143 --> 00:17:45,235
Then it's fixed!

310
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:48,273
No! The society meeting is on Sunday.
You have to attend it.

311
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:51,115
You look after the
society's meeting.

312
00:17:51,183 --> 00:17:54,152
Raju, its important for you to be..
- Please! l love discourses!

313
00:17:54,553 --> 00:17:55,611
Please! - Just for you, Piddu!

314
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,889
Sister-in-law, l am
saved! Thank you!

315
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:59,618
See you on Sunday.
- Yes.

316
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:01,853
Come on!
- Bye, sister-in-law! - Bye!

317
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:05,655
What happened?

318
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,830
l kept it here. Where did it go?

319
00:18:14,106 --> 00:18:15,869
What?
- That..

320
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:18,100
Hang on, sir.

321
00:18:27,253 --> 00:18:28,686
Sir, this too.

322
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:31,715
Sir, there is a scheme.

323
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:34,784
lf you buy two, you will get
one talcum powder free.

324
00:18:36,729 --> 00:18:38,697
Did you hear, Suman? Scheme.

325
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:40,664
l too have a scheme.

326
00:18:50,276 --> 00:18:52,608
Suman, you too.

327
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:55,006
You always watch stupid Hindi films.

328
00:18:56,048 --> 00:18:57,140
What's your problem?

329
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,547
You don't take me to cinema halls.

330
00:18:59,618 --> 00:19:01,142
At home too, you don't let
me watch movies on TV.

331
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,585
All these are useless things.

332
00:19:04,056 --> 00:19:07,992
Actors don't deserve anything.

333
00:19:08,561 --> 00:19:09,858
What do you mean?

334
00:19:09,995 --> 00:19:12,793
l mean they just have good looks.

335
00:19:12,898 --> 00:19:14,923
People like you place
them on a pedestal.

336
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,661
ls this called success?

337
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:20,135
Raju, l want to talk to you.

338
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:23,099
Yes. Tell me.

339
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:26,702
When will we plan a family?

340
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:29,111
Family? Why?
- What do you mean why?

341
00:19:29,181 --> 00:19:31,172
Look at Piddu. lt's been three months
since he got married.

342
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,740
And Meenu is seven months pregnant.

343
00:19:32,918 --> 00:19:34,044
ls this called family planning?

344
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:36,515
This is called saving yourself
from disgrace, Suman.

345
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:37,647
Saving yourself from disgrace!

346
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:40,049
Whatever! They both are happy!

347
00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:42,784
We too are happy, aren't we?

348
00:19:43,028 --> 00:19:44,086
You don't understand, Raju.

349
00:19:44,163 --> 00:19:45,630
lt's been five years to our marriage.

350
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:46,789
lf we won't plan anything now then..

351
00:19:46,866 --> 00:19:48,094
..our family will start
getting suspicious.

352
00:19:48,234 --> 00:19:52,193
You don't worry. l have a
special planning for kids.

353
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,863
Scheme! Scheme! l
will just show you!

354
00:19:53,939 --> 00:19:55,907
No! Scheme for children!
- Here it comes!

355
00:19:55,975 --> 00:19:57,875
No! Listen! l will show you!

356
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,138
From this tree, we receive
10,000 rupees in three months.

357
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:04,273
Right?

358
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,546
lf we grow the tree like this
then we will receive..

359
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:10,214
..50000 rupees in three months.

360
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:15,556
lf we grow it like this..
then we will receive..

361
00:20:15,628 --> 00:20:19,894
..1 .5 lakh in three months, Suman.

362
00:20:19,965 --> 00:20:21,023
1 .5 lakh!

363
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:24,832
Then we can plan for children.

364
00:20:24,904 --> 00:20:27,099
So that you can raise them nicely.

365
00:20:27,673 --> 00:20:32,133
l mean to say that this man..
- Raju!

366
00:20:33,112 --> 00:20:35,080
Our child depends on him.

367
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,238
goodnight!

368
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:40,579
Nice!
- Not nice!

369
00:20:40,653 --> 00:20:42,848
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra..

370
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:46,787
Flirtatious Kishan Kanhaiya.

371
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:49,828
Radha came running.

372
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:51,925
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

373
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:54,227
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

374
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,268
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

375
00:20:56,335 --> 00:20:58,667
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

376
00:20:58,737 --> 00:21:00,034
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

377
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:01,629
Ta Ra Ra Ra.

378
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:03,538
He breaks the pot.

379
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:06,203
My Shyam takes the
cows for grazing.

380
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,041
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

381
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:09,978
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

382
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:11,914
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

383
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:14,077
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

384
00:21:14,153 --> 00:21:17,680
Ta Ra Ra Ra! Ta Ra Ra Ra!

385
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:21,192
Ta Ra Ra Ra! Ta Ra Ra Ra!

386
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:26,220
Player of flute, Kishan Kanhaiya
steals and eats the butter.

387
00:21:26,298 --> 00:21:28,027
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

388
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,068
Say Ta Ra Ra Ra.

389
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:33,830
Ta Ra Ra Ra! Ta Ra Ra Ra!

390
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:37,637
Ta Ra Ra Ra! Ta Ra Ra Ra!

391
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,972
Wow!
- Wow! Wow!

392
00:21:39,044 --> 00:21:43,572
Everybody say, Lord Krishna!
- Hail!

393
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:46,083
Bear one thing in mind.
Everything else is fine.

394
00:21:46,819 --> 00:21:48,684
Fine? greetings.

395
00:21:49,054 --> 00:21:50,112
Come on!

396
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,682
You guys are done?

397
00:21:53,025 --> 00:21:54,083
Mr. Sharman, just two minutes.

398
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,717
Please meet my friend Rajendra.

399
00:21:55,894 --> 00:21:59,921
Call him. - Rajendra, come
here! - Coming! Coming!

400
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,057
He is coming!

401
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:03,634
What fun, Piddu!

402
00:22:03,702 --> 00:22:05,169
Rajendra, he is Mr. Sharman.

403
00:22:05,537 --> 00:22:08,062
He is a renowned astrologer.
Ask him something.

404
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:10,608
Are you mad?
- Your dreams are very big.

405
00:22:12,544 --> 00:22:13,602
What?

406
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,910
Very soon you will find yourself
face to face with your dreams.

407
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:19,208
Saw that?

408
00:22:19,284 --> 00:22:21,616
He tells you your past and future
clearer than a bank statement.

409
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:24,815
Piddu, l don't need any
bank statement. - Why?

410
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:26,750
Piddu, just think.

411
00:22:26,992 --> 00:22:29,552
lf you need 10 crores
and he tells you that..

412
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:31,562
..you will get only 5 crores then..

413
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,894
..you won't be able to enjoy
the remaining 5 crores too.

414
00:22:33,966 --> 00:22:35,024
Right?

415
00:22:35,167 --> 00:22:38,625
At times, knowing your future
can be beneficial.

416
00:22:38,904 --> 00:22:41,634
Yes. But not for me, pundit.

417
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:44,574
Because according to me its
futile to play the match..

418
00:22:44,643 --> 00:22:46,270
..which is already fixed.

419
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:47,636
Right?

420
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:48,975
You guys are here!
- Hi, sister-in-law.

421
00:22:49,048 --> 00:22:50,242
l have been
searching for you guys since long!

422
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:52,573
Come on! Your sweetmeat
is waiting for you.

423
00:22:52,651 --> 00:22:54,016
Sweetmeat is waiting
for me! Did you hear?

424
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:55,883
Did you know that sweetmeat
is waiting for me?

425
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:57,581
Come and eat sweetmeat.

426
00:22:57,656 --> 00:22:59,021
Come! Come! Come! Come!
- Come on!

427
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:00,180
Suman, shall l tell you something?

428
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:04,796
Today you are looking
very beautiful.

429
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:06,023
You are praising me so much.

430
00:23:06,965 --> 00:23:08,057
Didn't l say it at home?

431
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:11,269
l say it everyday at home.
Maybe you go off to sleep.

432
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:13,798
Quiet. He is coming.

433
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,598
Yes, sir.
- Yes.

434
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:17,600
What would you like to have?

435
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:19,034
What will you have?

436
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:21,604
Lemon juice.

437
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:23,944
Lemon juice. That's it?
- Lemon juice.

438
00:23:25,651 --> 00:23:28,119
Fine. Lemon juice for her.
ln mineral water.

439
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:31,148
For me a large peg of rum. No water.

440
00:23:31,857 --> 00:23:32,915
Okay, sir.

441
00:23:32,991 --> 00:23:34,652
Let your boss arrive. Already
you have started drinking.

442
00:23:34,727 --> 00:23:36,627
l am drinking in anticipation
of his arrival.

443
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:37,992
Raju, you just need excuses.

444
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:40,930
The delight of narrating the
scheme will be more with rum.

445
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:43,963
Just watch, Suman. Today
boss will be convinced.

446
00:23:53,178 --> 00:23:54,645
Hi!
- Hello, sir!

447
00:23:54,713 --> 00:23:55,771
How are you?

448
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:56,906
Sir, my wife Suman.

449
00:23:56,982 --> 00:23:58,745
greetings.
- Hi.

450
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:03,578
Sorry. l got late. l was about
to leave when Mehra phoned.

451
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:04,713
And after that..

452
00:24:04,957 --> 00:24:07,892
Sir, you are the boss. Please sit.

453
00:24:08,794 --> 00:24:10,193
l am late so many times.

454
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:12,928
Boss never scolds me.

455
00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:15,623
Sir, cheers.

456
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:31,548
Sir, l have got such a balm
for your heartache..

457
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:33,881
..that you will pat my back.

458
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:35,211
See this.

459
00:24:36,755 --> 00:24:37,813
See it.

460
00:24:39,258 --> 00:24:41,692
Basu. Your father-in-law.

461
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:46,894
His name is the last in the list
of best earners of this scheme.

462
00:24:48,634 --> 00:24:53,071
Sir, l say this is the golden
chance to teach your enemy a lesson.

463
00:24:53,672 --> 00:24:54,866
What are you trying to say?

464
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,732
Sir is getting a divorce.

465
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:00,671
lt's not his fault.
lt's just happening.

466
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,514
Sir, if l had as many
contacts as you have..

467
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:09,247
..then l would have been the number
one earner of this scheme.

468
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:12,820
Sir, your father-in-law might
disgrace you in the court.

469
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:16,858
But he shouldn't overtake
you in this scheme, sir.

470
00:25:17,095 --> 00:25:19,188
Show him what you are!

471
00:25:20,966 --> 00:25:24,595
l am happy that you are
so concerned about me.

472
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:27,738
But l won't be able to do this.

473
00:25:28,607 --> 00:25:35,877
Every man.. l mean every man can't
have qualities like you.

474
00:25:36,548 --> 00:25:39,176
And.. don't drag me in this mess.

475
00:25:39,685 --> 00:25:40,743
No, sir.

476
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:47,285
Don't think that l am trying to
convince, entice or lure you.

477
00:25:47,659 --> 00:25:48,717
This is not true.

478
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:51,552
Have you ever thought
why this scheme..

479
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:54,292
..is more important than my life?

480
00:25:55,701 --> 00:25:59,569
Why do l insist like a child and
compel everyone to hear this scheme?

481
00:25:59,938 --> 00:26:01,098
Danvriksh! Danvriksh!

482
00:26:01,707 --> 00:26:05,507
Why? Because this scheme
has shown me that dream..

483
00:26:05,577 --> 00:26:10,207
..which my 10 year old
job didn't show me, sir.

484
00:26:11,617 --> 00:26:14,984
Sir, dream to prosper. Sir,
dream to be happy.

485
00:26:15,053 --> 00:26:16,782
Sir, dream to win the world.

486
00:26:18,657 --> 00:26:22,149
Honestly speaking, l never saw
this form of Rajendra before.

487
00:26:22,527 --> 00:26:23,585
And..

488
00:26:32,971 --> 00:26:35,235
Raju! Raju!

489
00:26:36,942 --> 00:26:40,036
He is not used to drinking.
l am really sorry.

490
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:45,112
No, its okay. lt's all right.
At times, it happens.

491
00:26:48,186 --> 00:26:49,744
Come, l will escort you home.

492
00:26:49,821 --> 00:26:51,652
Let's take him home.

493
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:52,883
l am so sorry.

494
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:55,685
Waiter! Come!

495
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,095
Rajendra!
- Raju!

496
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,619
Ra..

497
00:27:06,171 --> 00:27:07,229
Come.

498
00:27:26,959 --> 00:27:28,984
Shall l tell you about the scheme?

499
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:12,895
Come.

500
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:20,942
Are you happy with this marriage?

501
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,138
What?

502
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:25,107
l am sorry.

503
00:28:26,184 --> 00:28:30,086
l didn't mean to offend you. Sorry.

504
00:28:30,689 --> 00:28:32,714
l know what you mean to ask.

505
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,125
Rajendra wants to be
a big man quickly.

506
00:28:37,996 --> 00:28:41,159
Maybe people don't
take him seriously.

507
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,597
But, l know, he really loves
me. He loves me a lot.

508
00:28:45,537 --> 00:28:47,767
Right now, maybe he can't think
of anything besides his dream.

509
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:49,534
But, the day his dreams come true..

510
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:53,942
..he will give me all the
happiness in the world.

511
00:28:56,148 --> 00:29:02,678
Actually, l myself.. l myself
am going through a divorce.

512
00:29:02,754 --> 00:29:03,812
And, l..

513
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:05,886
l can't think straight.

514
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,493
Love or marriage doesn't
hold any value for me.

515
00:29:09,561 --> 00:29:11,995
l.. l am sorry.

516
00:29:14,032 --> 00:29:19,902
When Rajendra wakes up, tell him
that l am interested in his scheme.

517
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:21,663
Thanks.

518
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:28,506
And.. he.. he has a perfect
wife..

519
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,916
..which l never had.

520
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:49,858
Drunk like a drunkard!

521
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:51,262
Now, too, he is not waking up!

522
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:54,164
lf not me then you should have at
least thought about yourself!

523
00:29:57,042 --> 00:29:58,202
Look at you? Didn't you feel
ashamed?

524
00:29:58,276 --> 00:29:59,766
What impression that
would've made on him?

525
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,207
lt's a different thing to
dream about being a big man.

526
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:07,717
And being a big man
is a different thing.

527
00:30:07,786 --> 00:30:11,620
Oh, god!

528
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,851
You were swaying on your
boss' and wife's shoulder!

529
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:15,050
Weren't you ashamed?

530
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:17,926
What am l asking? Weren't
you ashamed?

531
00:30:18,563 --> 00:30:20,087
Yes. l felt ashamed.

532
00:30:20,565 --> 00:30:22,624
go and see your face in the mirror.

533
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:23,826
How will you see?

534
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:25,864
Here. Wear your glasses.

535
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:29,005
Here. Wear your glasses properly.

536
00:30:29,074 --> 00:30:30,769
Yesterday, it was hanging half on
your head and half on your eyes.

537
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:33,635
go and take a bath.

538
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:35,645
Today, your boss will invest
in your scheme.

539
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:45,656
Boss will invest in the scheme!

540
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:49,253
l love you!

541
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,295
Wow! good morning!

542
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:53,322
Dim-witted!

543
00:30:56,668 --> 00:30:58,329
Wow! good morning, Janak!

544
00:30:58,904 --> 00:30:59,928

545
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:04,105
Wow! Today, the ambience
seems different.

546
00:31:04,176 --> 00:31:06,201
Sir, you should have been
here at 9 o'clock.

547
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:10,143
Wow! Repeating boss' dialogue!

548
00:31:10,615 --> 00:31:11,673
Boss didn't come?

549
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:13,613
He came. But he was arrested.

550
00:31:14,152 --> 00:31:16,177
Arrested? What do you mean? How?

551
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:17,681
ln dowry case.

552
00:31:17,989 --> 00:31:20,651
Dowry! But, today, l had
a meeting with him.

553
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:22,283
AgM sir has taken the charge.

554
00:31:23,228 --> 00:31:25,890
Mr. Nagpal? So soon!

555
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:28,132
go. He has called you inside.
- Why has he called me?

556
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:29,725
What happened, sir?

557
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:32,559
lf l again see you doing
your scheme business..

558
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,764
..in the office premises..

559
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:37,665
Understood? You will lose
your job that very day.

560
00:31:38,643 --> 00:31:39,701
Okay.

561
00:31:41,646 --> 00:31:43,079
Leave.
- Shall l leave, sir?

562
00:31:44,082 --> 00:31:45,140
Listen!
- Yes!

563
00:31:46,117 --> 00:31:47,641
Do you have a watch?
- Yes.

564
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:48,879
No need to look at it now.

565
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:50,814
See it while coming for office.

566
00:31:51,656 --> 00:31:53,783
Okay. - Tomorrow onward, you
will come to office on time!

567
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:54,916
Everyday, sir.

568
00:31:55,894 --> 00:31:57,691
go!
- Shall l leave, sir?

569
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,868
Sir, in the morning boss
left this for you.

570
00:32:07,939 --> 00:32:09,839
Boss?
- Mr. Shekhar.

571
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:27,654
'Sorry, Rajendra. Your sister-in-law
showed her true colours.'

572
00:32:28,627 --> 00:32:30,185
'She has framed me in a false case.'

573
00:32:34,132 --> 00:32:35,224
'But, l promise.'

574
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:40,628
'Once l get out of this mess, l
will surely invest in your scheme.'

575
00:32:44,776 --> 00:32:46,676
'Rajendra, always remember
one thing.'

576
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:50,203
'ln life, nothing is more
important than family.'

577
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:56,148
'You are a very lucky man to have
such a great life and a wife.'

578
00:32:58,256 --> 00:32:59,621
'Take care of both.'

579
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:15,997
Suman!

580
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:17,734
Suman, where are you?

581
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:18,867
ln the kitchen.

582
00:33:18,943 --> 00:33:20,001
What are you doing?

583
00:33:20,078 --> 00:33:21,204
Did your boss become a member?

584
00:33:21,613 --> 00:33:24,980
Leave all this and come on..

585
00:33:25,216 --> 00:33:26,808
What exactly are you making?

586
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:27,943
l don't want to eat all this.

587
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:29,077
l will feed you chilly.

588
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:32,612
Chilly.. do you know what l feel
like eating today? - What?

589
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:35,091
l feel like.. eating popcorn today.

590
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,218
And, where do you get popcorn?

591
00:33:36,294 --> 00:33:37,556
ln the theatres.

592
00:33:37,629 --> 00:33:38,891
So, let's go to the theatre.

593
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:40,620
Theatre.
- To see a film.

594
00:33:41,199 --> 00:33:42,257
Excuse me.
- Yes.

595
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:45,028
Do you have fever? Are you
feeling fine? - Why?

596
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:46,161
You, and movie.

597
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:48,902
So what if l don't like
movies but you do.

598
00:33:48,973 --> 00:33:50,907
And, l like whatever you like.

599
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:52,169
Just the way you like this chilly.

600
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:53,574
So, l like it too.

601
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:54,703
Here, l will eat it.

602
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,038
Oh, god.

603
00:33:58,249 --> 00:33:59,307
get ready quickly.

604
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:01,513
Are you serious?
- Yes.

605
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:02,712
Are we going?
- Yes, we are.

606
00:34:02,787 --> 00:34:04,015
Eat it, l will get ready soon.

607
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:13,190
Contractor's name should
spell disaster.

608
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,177
Suman! Suman!

609
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:35,744
Hi, Suman!

610
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,048
l will be back. Hi.

611
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:39,116
How are you?
- How are you?

612
00:34:41,192 --> 00:34:42,250
Thank you.

613
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,754
You are looking sweet.
- Thanks.

614
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:46,221
Hi.
- Hello.

615
00:34:46,297 --> 00:34:47,992
Meet my husband and
she is my friend.

616
00:34:48,266 --> 00:34:50,757
How much?
- 230 rupees.

617
00:35:00,111 --> 00:35:01,169
Here.

618
00:35:06,217 --> 00:35:07,684
l will see you, bye.

619
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:12,683
guess what, l just talked
to Rita about your scheme.

620
00:35:12,757 --> 00:35:13,815
She is ready to invest in it.

621
00:35:13,892 --> 00:35:14,950
What are you saying?

622
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:16,625
That's my sweet wife.

623
00:35:17,862 --> 00:35:19,261
l will be back from the bathroom.

624
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:20,689
You carry on.

625
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:21,990
Have it inside.

626
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:42,882
What scheme was she talking about?
- Who?

627
00:35:43,154 --> 00:35:44,883
That baby doll.

628
00:35:45,723 --> 00:35:47,657
Nonsense scheme.

629
00:35:47,725 --> 00:35:51,627
lt wasn't the scheme! l
was just staring at her! - Yes.

630
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:55,064
But, she was a beauty.

631
00:35:55,133 --> 00:35:56,691
She was gorgeous.

632
00:35:57,068 --> 00:35:59,229
l was staring at her too.

633
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:02,831
Oh, so you too.

634
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,968
Yes, l didn't know she was
sister-in-law's friend.

635
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,168
lf l knew..

636
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:09,577
Did we fulfill our dreams?

637
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:12,908
So now..

638
00:36:14,185 --> 00:36:16,745
Shall we stop here?

639
00:36:19,591 --> 00:36:21,650
Or, shall we see another dream?

640
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:26,087
What happened?

641
00:36:26,164 --> 00:36:27,859
Do you want to be the world's
largest company?

642
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:38,200
What happened?
- Nothing.

643
00:36:41,179 --> 00:36:42,271
Did your boss join the scheme?

644
00:36:46,951 --> 00:36:48,748
Boss got arrested in a dowry case.

645
00:36:49,888 --> 00:36:50,946
What?

646
00:36:51,856 --> 00:36:52,914
My god.

647
00:36:54,692 --> 00:36:56,626
The wives these days
are so unpredictable.

648
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:59,023
The husbands are quite
deceitful too.

649
00:36:59,564 --> 00:37:00,622
You mean your boss.

650
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:03,191
No!

651
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:07,629
Suman.
- Yes.

652
00:37:08,606 --> 00:37:11,507
l am not going to meet
Rita tomorrow. - Why?

653
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:12,634
What happened?

654
00:37:13,578 --> 00:37:16,012
l don't think she will invest.

655
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:17,906
What is this?

656
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:19,040
How do you know?

657
00:37:19,117 --> 00:37:20,607
She's my friend, she has assured me.

658
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:22,877
l don't want to go.

659
00:37:23,955 --> 00:37:25,252
Don't be stern like children.

660
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,784
You are not in the mood today.

661
00:37:26,858 --> 00:37:27,916
Meet her in the evening.

662
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:29,523
That's strange, l am telling
you l don't want to go.

663
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:30,925
Don't you understand?

664
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:42,664
god knows what's wrong with him?

665
00:37:43,708 --> 00:37:46,176
He's doing things he
never did in five years!

666
00:37:47,211 --> 00:37:49,873
Did he have to yell so loudly
for such a small thing?

667
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:55,147
l tried to support him at
every step, in everything.

668
00:37:57,989 --> 00:37:59,081
What kind of behaviour is this?

669
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:05,620
god, l can't endure it anymore.

670
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:08,594
What do we lack?

671
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:09,724
We have everything.

672
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:12,695
Then, why does he wander
around with his schemes?

673
00:38:13,004 --> 00:38:14,665
He is always running after money.

674
00:38:15,573 --> 00:38:16,972
This is madness.

675
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:19,834
Do something.

676
00:38:20,578 --> 00:38:21,943
Cure him of this madness.

677
00:38:23,147 --> 00:38:25,741
Make him realise the
small joys of life.

678
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:29,715
You know, how he is?

679
00:38:30,054 --> 00:38:31,214
He won't do anything on his own.

680
00:38:33,124 --> 00:38:34,785
Why are you still standing there?

681
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:36,716
Help me!

682
00:38:53,645 --> 00:38:55,237
l have arrived.

683
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:03,613
End your search here.

684
00:39:03,688 --> 00:39:06,088
Change your destiny in three hours.

685
00:39:06,157 --> 00:39:08,557
And become a millionaire before
the end of the day.

686
00:39:10,061 --> 00:39:12,655
Mr. Rajendra, come here.

687
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,960
Come and test your luck.

688
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:22,729
How do you know my name?

689
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:27,107
Distressed! Troubled!

690
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:30,113
l call everyone Mr. Rajendra.

691
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:32,672
Everyone is equal for me.
- Really.

692
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:35,950
Then sell this lottery ticket
to someone equal to you.

693
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,783
Listen to me.

694
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:39,516
Buy this ticket today, and you
won't have to buy another..

695
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,989
..your entire life.

696
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:43,186
The lottery results will
be declared in three hours.

697
00:39:43,261 --> 00:39:46,856
And in the fifth hour, the money
will be transferred to your account.

698
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:49,190
What a lie.
- No!

699
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:51,531
Even politicians don't lie so much.

700
00:39:51,602 --> 00:39:53,593
No. You don't understand.

701
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:57,072
Listen to me..
- What kind of a person are you?

702
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:58,870
l said, no, but still you
are not listening.

703
00:39:58,943 --> 00:40:00,672
Why don't you want it?

704
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:02,975
No one at my home has eaten
for the past three days!

705
00:40:03,047 --> 00:40:04,605
My wife is fighting with me.

706
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:06,110
Look at the plight of my children.

707
00:40:06,184 --> 00:40:08,652
Children, come here.

708
00:40:08,886 --> 00:40:10,114
Look, take a look at their faces.

709
00:40:10,855 --> 00:40:14,621
l plead to you, please
buy the ticket.

710
00:40:14,792 --> 00:40:15,850
Have mercy.

711
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:17,087
Another charade!

712
00:40:17,662 --> 00:40:18,720
Fine, give me one.

713
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,566
go children.
- Here. - go.

714
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:23,930
Pick your ticket.

715
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:26,066
l..
- Take this one.

716
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,228
No, l don't want this one.

717
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:29,933
l..
- No, take this one.

718
00:40:31,242 --> 00:40:32,709
No, not this one.

719
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:34,301
No, take this one.

720
00:40:36,013 --> 00:40:37,071
You are just too much?

721
00:40:37,582 --> 00:40:39,049
Now you will tell me which
one l should buy.

722
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:40,311
Look, don't trouble me.

723
00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,075
You don't understand.

724
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:45,589
This ticket's result
will be declared.

725
00:40:45,656 --> 00:40:47,647
Then, why don't you buy it?

726
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:50,592
l cannot, because you
are destined to.

727
00:40:50,661 --> 00:40:52,060
Why are you arguing?

728
00:40:52,597 --> 00:40:54,064
What a fraud.

729
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:58,666
You know, l don't want
a lottery ticket.

730
00:40:58,736 --> 00:40:59,725
Mr. Rajendra.
- Leave me.

731
00:40:59,804 --> 00:41:00,862
Mr. Rajendra.
- Let go.

732
00:41:00,938 --> 00:41:01,996
Mr. Rajendra, listen.
- l don't want it.

733
00:41:02,073 --> 00:41:03,540
Okay!

734
00:41:03,608 --> 00:41:05,872
Distressed! Troubled!

735
00:41:05,943 --> 00:41:09,879
Distressed! Troubled! god.

736
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,281
Mr. Sharma!
- Mr. Dubey.

737
00:41:18,289 --> 00:41:19,620
What difference does it make?

738
00:41:19,891 --> 00:41:20,983
l only want to invest.

739
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:22,116
What difference does it make?

740
00:41:22,193 --> 00:41:23,251
Do it.

741
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:26,560
Actually. On this anniversary,
l want to..

742
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:28,599
..gift my wife a future.

743
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:31,294

Three lakhs in three years.

748
00:41:38,876 --> 00:41:41,003
Three lakhs! Hear that. Three lakhs!

749
00:41:41,646 --> 00:41:44,638
l know. lt's a tedious job.

750
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:46,182
You have to call people and blabber.

751
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,308
l know very well.

752
00:41:47,385 --> 00:41:48,579
What are you doing?

753
00:41:48,653 --> 00:41:49,984
Bring tea for him, with extra sugar.

754
00:41:50,054 --> 00:41:51,112
That's not it.

755
00:41:51,189 --> 00:41:52,850
My friend's friend is in this too.

756
00:41:52,924 --> 00:41:54,186
What did he say his name was?

757
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:56,058
Yes, l remembered! Rajendra.

758
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,591
Mister, the situation is such..

759
00:41:57,662 --> 00:41:59,653
..that people maintain
their distance from him.

760
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:01,122
Look, Mr. Sharma is right there.

761
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:03,793
You are mistaken.
go and meet him, please.

762
00:42:03,968 --> 00:42:06,266
And bring coffee for the
boss, without sugar.

763
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:08,196
Nagpal sir.

764
00:42:13,644 --> 00:42:15,168
Rita's beauty parlour.

765
00:42:16,614 --> 00:42:17,672
Seems like this is the place.

766
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:26,917
lt's so dark.

767
00:42:27,158 --> 00:42:30,559
Hello!

00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:34,291

And, you.

776
00:42:52,583 --> 00:42:55,711
l send them on visits.

777
00:42:58,256 --> 00:42:59,314
Take a seat.

778
00:43:02,193 --> 00:43:03,251
Okay.

779
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:07,088
Thank you.

780
00:43:07,932 --> 00:43:11,868
You must play cards.
- Yes, l do.

781
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:14,194
During Diwali, sometimes
for good fortune.

782
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:15,534
Then play today too.

783
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:18,667
Until Rita arrives.

784
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:20,942
But, l don't play with money.

785
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:22,909
But, we do.

786
00:43:23,981 --> 00:43:25,039
Fine, let's do one thing.

787
00:43:25,182 --> 00:43:27,616
We will play with money,
and you play without it.

788
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:29,949
Fair deal.
- Okay!

789
00:43:44,835 --> 00:43:47,929
l bet one lakh.

790
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,104
Two lakhs!
- Three lakhs.

791
00:43:57,648 --> 00:44:01,175
One lakh! Two lakhs! Three lakhs!

00:44:03,921 --> 00:44:04,979
Four lakhs!

793
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:23,031
Show!

794
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:34,675
Wow!

795
00:44:40,057 --> 00:44:41,888
You have won.

796
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:44,160
This money is now yours.

797
00:44:45,563 --> 00:44:47,155
All this money is mine.
- Yes.

798
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:50,291
Thank you.

799
00:44:51,102 --> 00:44:53,627
Thank you! Pick up the money.

800
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:57,632
No, l was just playing for fun.

801
00:44:57,708 --> 00:44:59,767
l can't take this money.

802
00:45:00,011 --> 00:45:02,002
You have won them! This
money now is yours.

803
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,513
This is real money! l was
playing with fake money!

804
00:45:04,582 --> 00:45:06,846
l cannot take this.

805
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,885
You will have to take
it, this is your money!

806
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:10,682
You are a strange man,
you don't understand.

807
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:13,189
l told you, l don't
touch gambling money!

808
00:45:13,257 --> 00:45:14,815
Take them back.

809
00:45:14,892 --> 00:45:16,860
Why don't you? This is your money.

810
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,189
l don't take gambling money!
- They are yours.

811
00:45:18,262 --> 00:45:19,854
l don't want them.
- They are yours.

812
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,693
You will have to take it.
- No, l don't.

813
00:45:21,766 --> 00:45:23,199
Distressed! Troubled!

814
00:45:23,267 --> 00:45:24,529
Distressed! Troubled!

815
00:45:24,602 --> 00:45:27,036
Distressed! Troubled! god.

816
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:29,004
Hello! Suman!

817
00:45:29,073 --> 00:45:30,870
Boss! Boss!

818
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:31,999
Yes, tell me.

819
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:33,668
l am at Rita's parlour.

820
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,272
She is on a visit.

821
00:45:38,682 --> 00:45:39,876
l am still in the parlour.

822
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,008
She is on a visit.

823
00:45:45,222 --> 00:45:46,621
Just a minute, l will call you back.

824
00:45:47,625 --> 00:45:48,683
What happened?

825
00:45:49,026 --> 00:45:50,618
Moonlight Bar.

826
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:53,758
Then, Rita's parlour..

827
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:32,529
A strange thing happened
with me, Suman.

828
00:46:36,006 --> 00:46:37,633
Today, when l went
to Rita's parlour.

829
00:46:40,144 --> 00:46:42,169
lt turned out to be a gambling den.

830
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:46,878
And, when l came out.

831
00:46:48,853 --> 00:46:50,218
lt wasn't Rita's parlour.

832
00:46:51,622 --> 00:46:52,953
You mustn't have read it correctly.

833
00:46:55,659 --> 00:46:56,717
Not only that.

834
00:46:59,897 --> 00:47:06,632
While waiting in the parlour.. just
for fun..

835
00:47:08,072 --> 00:47:09,130
l started playing cards.

836
00:47:11,175 --> 00:47:15,134
And, Suman, within moments..
l won ten crore rupees.

837
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,945
Ten crore rupees, Suman.

838
00:47:18,816 --> 00:47:19,874
Ten crore rupees.

839
00:47:25,723 --> 00:47:27,020
But, l didn't accept that money.

840
00:47:31,595 --> 00:47:32,960
Was l foolish?

841
00:47:36,167 --> 00:47:37,566
You didn't do any foolishness.

842
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,222
lt's so strange.

843
00:48:13,137 --> 00:48:17,631
The thing l desired the most,
l was getting it.

844
00:48:19,877 --> 00:48:21,640
But, not in the way l wanted.

845
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:28,175
gambling is not a way
to earn money, Suman!

846
00:48:31,188 --> 00:48:34,589
Money should be earned with
hard work and intelligence.

847
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:37,652
lsn't it?

848
00:48:46,003 --> 00:48:47,061
Coming.

849
00:48:47,605 --> 00:48:49,869
Uncle! - l have arrived.

850
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:51,232
What?

851
00:48:51,809 --> 00:48:53,800
l thought l should come
here, so l did.

852
00:48:53,877 --> 00:48:55,037
Why are you closing the door?

853
00:48:55,112 --> 00:48:56,739
Who are you? Listen.

854
00:48:56,814 --> 00:48:57,940
What a beautiful house.

855
00:48:58,015 --> 00:48:59,539
Sister-in-law, listen to me.
- Listen.

856
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:01,983
Why did you..
- You didn't recognise me?

857
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:03,544
You didn't, isn't it?

858
00:49:03,621 --> 00:49:05,816
How can you, when we have never met?

859
00:49:05,889 --> 00:49:07,652
But, take a seat..
- But you..

860
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:09,818
l am not a stranger.

861
00:49:10,227 --> 00:49:12,752
Until you don't take a seat,
how can l tell you who l am?

862
00:49:12,830 --> 00:49:14,161
Take a seat.
- But..

863
00:49:14,231 --> 00:49:16,495
Calm down sister-in-law,
l will tell you.

864
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:18,034
Sit. Sit, comfortably.

865
00:49:18,102 --> 00:49:19,228
l am not a stranger.

866
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,238
Actually, l have come
here to meet you.

867
00:49:22,506 --> 00:49:23,564
Me!

868
00:49:25,576 --> 00:49:27,168
l have actually come
to meet Rajendra.

869
00:49:27,244 --> 00:49:29,906
But, you and Rajendra are the same.

870
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,107
So meeting you is like meeting him.

871
00:49:32,182 --> 00:49:35,777
Actually, l want to know about
Rajendra's scheme.

872
00:49:36,186 --> 00:49:39,178
l will call him.

873
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:40,723
There's no need to get up.

874
00:49:40,791 --> 00:49:41,849
He is coming here from the bathroom.

875
00:49:41,925 --> 00:49:43,119
And, will ask you Suman, who is he?

876
00:49:43,193 --> 00:49:44,251
lntroduce me then.

877
00:49:44,528 --> 00:49:46,723
Suman, who is it?

878
00:49:47,965 --> 00:49:50,160
Brother, l am so happy to meet you.

879
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:51,758
Why are you asking him?

880
00:49:51,835 --> 00:49:52,893
l will tell you.

881
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:54,028
lt's your house. Take a seat.

882
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:55,230
Why are you being formal?

883
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:57,205
Take a seat, sir.

884
00:49:57,274 --> 00:49:59,538
This is called the perfect couple.

885
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:00,668
Ram and Sita.

886
00:50:01,011 --> 00:50:02,069
Who l am?

887
00:50:02,146 --> 00:50:03,807
My name is gurdeep Singh Bhanot.

888
00:50:03,881 --> 00:50:05,041
l am from Phagwada.

889
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:06,675
Why have l come?

890
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,650
Sir, what else could l have done?

891
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:10,550
Since l heard about your scheme..

892
00:50:10,621 --> 00:50:12,885
..l have lost my slumber.

893
00:50:13,123 --> 00:50:15,614
Sister-in-law, he has devised
such a wonderful scheme.

894
00:50:15,693 --> 00:50:17,160
The mind goes out of control!

895
00:50:17,227 --> 00:50:18,888
Boom! Boom! Boom!

896
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:20,156
lt's a wonderful scheme sir.

Your scheme will contribute
to the progress of lndia.

898
00:50:23,634 --> 00:50:25,226
'Why is he praising me so much?'

899
00:50:25,636 --> 00:50:28,230
'No one liked my scheme so much.'

900
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:31,139
No one liked it because
everyone else is a fool.

901
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:37,108
Look, sister-in-law, a man like him
is born once in million years.

902
00:50:37,181 --> 00:50:38,580
See him today.

903
00:50:38,649 --> 00:50:40,276
You won't get to seem him
for another million years.

904
00:50:40,651 --> 00:50:42,619
But you..
- What do l want?

And, reap the rewards when
your scheme is a success.

908
00:50:55,666 --> 00:50:56,758
That's all.

909
00:50:57,735 --> 00:50:58,963
'Something is wrong.'

910
00:50:59,803 --> 00:51:01,202
'What is he thinking?'

911
00:51:01,271 --> 00:51:02,863
What am l thinking?

912
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,874
Shall l tell you?

913
00:51:05,843 --> 00:51:09,609
Tell me, who told you

Sir, l was sitting at my home.

916

And, l fell asleep.

917
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:26,188
And god came in my dreams.

And, told me, if you don't
buy this scheme..

919
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:30,657
..you will surely be ruined!

920
00:51:30,734 --> 00:51:32,292
Sir, l don't want, let me be ruined.

921
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:34,565

Suman, l am telling you

927
00:51:44,748 --> 00:51:48,081
That Sanjay is after me, he
doesn't want me to progress.

928
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:49,676
l am telling you, these
are Sanjay's plans.

929
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:52,688
Sir, no, sir..
- He is jealous of me.

930
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:54,917
Sir, you don't understand..
- l don't understand.

931
00:51:54,992 --> 00:51:56,323
l will explain you right away.

932
00:51:56,593 --> 00:51:58,584

Janak, where is my Dlwali gift?

00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:52,740
Sir..

951
00:52:54,751 --> 00:52:57,083
Boss has fired you from the job.
- What?

952
00:52:59,723 --> 00:53:04,183
He has asked you to take all
your brochures and leave.

953
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:14,935
How can he do this..
- Sir.

954
00:53:16,206 --> 00:53:18,606
He has refused to meet you.

955
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:51,721
Rajendra! Where are you going?

956
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:54,618
Home..
- Come on!

957
00:56:55,625 --> 00:56:56,785
Yes, come on.

958
00:57:12,509 --> 00:57:14,739
Your sister-in-law trapped
me for good.

959
00:57:19,649 --> 00:57:20,707
What's the matter?

960
00:57:20,784 --> 00:57:21,842
You looked worried.

961
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,612
Nothing, sir.

962
00:57:25,589 --> 00:57:26,715
l lost my job.

963
00:57:26,790 --> 00:57:27,848
Why, what happened?

964
00:57:28,258 --> 00:57:29,782
You know the agent.

965
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,592
He didn't like my scheme.

966
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:34,857
Why do you do these
things in the office?

967
00:57:36,633 --> 00:57:37,691
Fine, don't worry.

968
00:57:37,768 --> 00:57:38,826
l will talk to someone
about your job.

969
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:39,960
No, sir.

970
00:57:40,036 --> 00:57:41,594
l don't want to work now.

971
00:57:42,139 --> 00:57:43,197
Then?

972
00:57:44,107 --> 00:57:46,200
l will keep promoting
this scheme.

973
00:57:46,276 --> 00:57:47,573
Are you crazy?

974
00:57:48,779 --> 00:57:50,076
You have such responsibilities.

975
00:57:50,881 --> 00:57:51,939
l know, sir.

976
00:57:52,015 --> 00:57:54,540
And, l will carry out all
those responsibilities..

977
00:57:54,618 --> 00:57:56,711
..on the basis of this scheme, sir.

978
00:57:56,787 --> 00:57:58,049
Be practical, Rajendra.

979
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:01,682
Why are you ruining your
life for this scheme?

980
00:58:01,758 --> 00:58:04,591
Whatever, sir, this scheme
is my life now.

981
00:58:04,961 --> 00:58:06,952
l will earn lots of money now.

982
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:11,556
Money is not everything
in life, Rajendra.

983
00:58:11,635 --> 00:58:13,125
Those are just words, sir.

984
00:58:14,171 --> 00:58:16,799
Without money, you don't
have many things, sir.

985
00:58:25,682 --> 00:58:26,740
Thank you, sir.

986
00:58:32,589 --> 00:58:34,819
Best of luck.
- Thank you, sir.

987
00:58:51,274 --> 00:58:52,798
Uncle, that's, mine!

988
00:58:53,043 --> 00:58:54,203
Where did you get this from?

989
00:58:54,611 --> 00:58:56,135
l have many of them.

990
00:58:56,213 --> 00:58:57,874
You give them to papa every month.

991
00:58:57,948 --> 00:58:59,108
And papa gives them to me.

992
00:58:59,916 --> 00:59:01,076
And papa gives them to me.

993
00:59:01,484 --> 00:59:02,815
And you make a plane out of it.

994
00:59:02,886 --> 00:59:03,944
Not just that.

995
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:06,750
l draw on it. Play cross and nuts.

996
00:59:06,823 --> 00:59:09,189
And, sometimes, l even
do my homework on it.

997
00:59:09,593 --> 00:59:12,494
By the way, uncle, you
must have lots more.

998
00:59:12,562 --> 00:59:13,756
Will you give me, please?

999
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:18,491
l don't have. go from here.

1000
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:20,160
Uncle, please check.
You always have few.

1001
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:21,499
l said l don't have.

1002
00:59:21,571 --> 00:59:22,970
Uncle, please, you are
just avoiding it.

1003
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:24,097
l said l don't have it.
- No, no, uncle.

1004
00:59:24,174 --> 00:59:26,768
You just do that.

1005
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:27,901
Please uncle.
- Fine, keep quiet.

1006
00:59:28,778 --> 00:59:29,836
Naughty.

1007
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:32,806
Stand quietly.

1008
00:59:54,004 --> 00:59:55,062
What happened?

1009
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,166
Nothing, son, l don't have them.

1010
00:59:58,642 --> 01:00:00,735
Uncle, take a close look.
- No, son, l don't have it.

1011
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:03,711
Uncle, keep the money
on the side and see.

1012
01:00:06,182 --> 01:00:07,240
Money!

1013
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:10,916
There must be one under it.

1014
01:01:07,786 --> 01:01:09,253
l will get it.
- Okay!

1015
01:01:14,193 --> 01:01:15,592
What do you want?

1016
01:01:15,861 --> 01:01:18,261
Uncle, do you want
to keep all of it.

1017
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:21,329
What's the harm if l keep a few?

1018
01:01:21,534 --> 01:01:24,799
Son, it doesn't belong to me.

1019
01:01:25,471 --> 01:01:26,870
l don't know how it came into my bag.

1020
01:01:27,606 --> 01:01:30,404
And, they don't belong to us.

1021
01:01:30,743 --> 01:01:32,267
And you shouldn't use what
doesn't belong to others.

1022
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:33,402
What if we get caught?

1023
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:34,737
get caught.

1024
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,745
What are you saying, uncle?

1025
01:01:37,149 --> 01:01:38,480
l didn't get caught until now.

1026
01:01:38,884 --> 01:01:40,749
l made planes out of it many times.

1027
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:44,678
You.. make planes out of notes.

1028
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:47,290
Notes! What notes, uncle?

1029
01:01:47,626 --> 01:01:51,289
The notes, that you saw.. in my bag!

1030
01:01:51,564 --> 01:01:53,361
ln your bag.. money.

1031
01:01:54,233 --> 01:01:56,758
Uncle, l only saw brochures
in your bag.

1032
01:01:57,169 --> 01:01:58,693
Please, uncle, give me the brochures.

1033
01:01:58,904 --> 01:02:03,307
That means, you didn't
see notes in my bag.

1034
01:02:03,576 --> 01:02:05,771
No! Not at all.
- No!

1035
01:02:06,645 --> 01:02:07,703
Why are you laughing?

1036
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:10,239
Uncle, l want the brochures.

1037
01:02:10,316 --> 01:02:11,510
You want brochures, don't you?
- Yes.

1038
01:02:11,584 --> 01:02:13,711

brochures in the evening.

- No, no, l want it now.

1040
01:02:15,187 --> 01:02:16,245
Raju, come quickly.

1041
01:02:16,322 --> 01:02:17,653
Aunt is calling, she is quite angry.

1042
01:02:17,723 --> 01:02:19,714
Bye. l will give you in the evening.
- Yes. Raju, come quickly. - Bye.

1043

1044
01:02:21,527 --> 01:02:24,121
Suman, l..
- Look, the bank in your building..

1045
01:02:24,196 --> 01:02:25,527
..was looted of ten crores!

1046
01:02:25,731 --> 01:02:28,131
This is the bank, where ten
crore rupees was looted..

1047
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,258
..in broad daylight.

1048
01:02:29,335 --> 01:02:31,667
Till now, the police haven't
found any clue.

1049
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:34,134
According to the people, this
theft was committed..

1050
01:02:34,206 --> 01:02:36,731
..within 30 minutes of the
opening of the bank.

1051
01:02:37,209 --> 01:02:39,143
And, we haven't received
any information..

1052
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:40,542
..about the description
of the thief.

1053
01:02:40,613 --> 01:02:42,672
We will continue giving
you this report.

1054
01:02:42,748 --> 01:02:44,807
But, first, let's take a small break.

1055
01:02:49,622 --> 01:02:50,680
Are you going anywhere?

1056
01:02:51,423 --> 01:02:53,152
l am going to my bank.

1057
01:05:16,368 --> 01:05:19,098
Sorry, Mr. Rajendra, l could
not meet you in office.

1058
01:05:21,106 --> 01:05:22,300
You know that..

1059
01:05:25,677 --> 01:05:26,735
Mr. Rajendra!

1060
01:05:28,714 --> 01:05:32,172
Yes, okay! All that is fine
but.. leave all that..

1061
01:05:34,286 --> 01:05:36,117
That day, when l left from office..

1062
01:05:36,188 --> 01:05:37,849
..the bag that l had in my hand..

1063
01:05:38,423 --> 01:05:39,651
Do you remember what was in the bag?

1064
01:05:40,826 --> 01:05:44,660
Sir, both of us together had
packed brochures in the bag.

1065
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:46,390
Everyone in the office
saw that too.

1066
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,699
And you had closed the bag
with your own hands.

1067
01:05:48,767 --> 01:05:50,530
Sure?

1069
01:05:53,605 --> 01:05:54,663
Come.

Please come.

1071
01:06:04,249 --> 01:06:05,580
Prashant, go ahead.

1072
01:06:09,154 --> 01:06:11,418
This CC TV monitor.. from
which company is this?

1073
01:06:12,191 --> 01:06:14,182

For permanent use.

1076
01:06:20,432 --> 01:06:22,423
The picture quality, resolution..
everything is good.

1077
01:06:23,268 --> 01:06:26,169
The people who make world wide
animus use this the most.

1078
01:06:26,705 --> 01:06:30,573
After all what matters? Result!
lt can be seen.

01:06:32,678 --> 01:06:34,669
See.. just zoom it a little!
- Yes, do it!

1080
01:06:34,746 --> 01:06:35,804
Prashant, go for zoom.

1081
01:06:38,584 --> 01:06:41,781
Did you see, a little zoom and
the picture becomes blurred.

1082
01:06:42,187 --> 01:06:44,121
Sir! This is the same
man whom we can see..

1083
01:06:44,189 --> 01:06:45,679
..on our CC TV monitor.

1084
01:06:52,831 --> 01:06:55,129
He is Rajendra! May be

1085
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,862

01:07:00,205 --> 01:07:01,433
And you check it!

1088
01:07:01,707 --> 01:07:04,574
l distinctly remember that you
had kept that bag in your car.

1089
01:07:04,643 --> 01:07:06,873
But when you went you
took it along with you.

1090
01:07:07,246 --> 01:07:11,148
Sir, are you sure?
- Yes! What is the matter?

1091
01:07:11,216 --> 01:07:13,446
Why are you so worried?

1092
01:07:14,586 --> 01:07:16,417
Here, have some water. Have it!

1093
01:07:22,494 --> 01:07:23,722
Now tell me, what the problem is.

1094
01:07:26,732 --> 01:07:29,826
Sir, l don't know! l don't
understand anything.

1095
01:07:33,405 --> 01:07:35,498
l just don't know when you
come and when you go.

1096
01:07:36,241 --> 01:07:37,299
What happened?

1097
01:07:44,316 --> 01:07:48,446
Suman, Yesterday l was
sacked from my job.

1098
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,681
What? Why?

1099
01:07:56,395 --> 01:07:59,125
That.. l used to do the work
of my scheme in office..

1100
01:07:59,197 --> 01:08:01,358
..that is why.

1101
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:03,133
You are telling me this today?

1102
01:08:04,369 --> 01:08:06,132
l thought maybe you will
get angry that is why..

1103
01:08:06,204 --> 01:08:08,468
..l did not tell you.

1104
01:08:18,150 --> 01:08:19,208
Suman!
- Yes!

1105
01:08:21,253 --> 01:08:22,311
There is one more thing.

1106
01:08:27,392 --> 01:08:28,450
l will just be back.

1107
01:08:33,498 --> 01:08:35,625
Yes!
- lnspector Rana!

1108
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:39,102
Yes! - l want to interrogate
Mr. Rajendra Dubey..

01:08:39,171 --> 01:08:41,503

Bank robbery case.

01:08:42,140 --> 01:08:43,368
Bank robbery?
- Yes!

1111
01:08:43,542 --> 01:08:44,600
Why Rajendra Dubey?

1112
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:47,107
Because we have found his
image on the CC monitor..

1113
01:08:47,179 --> 01:08:49,147
..in the bank.

1114
01:08:49,414 --> 01:08:51,109
Okay, tomorrow if you find
Amitabh Bachchan's image..

1115
01:08:51,183 --> 01:08:53,447
..will you go to his house
for interrogation?

1116
01:08:53,618 --> 01:08:56,712
Look here, madam, l just want to
ask Mr. Dubey a few questions.

1117
01:08:56,788 --> 01:08:58,119
What do you mean by interrogation?

1118
01:08:58,190 --> 01:08:59,452
Will you trouble any decent man?

1119
01:08:59,524 --> 01:09:01,617
No, it is not like that.
- Then what is it?

1120
01:09:01,693 --> 01:09:03,126
You have doubts on my husband.

1121
01:09:03,195 --> 01:09:04,719
No, no, no doubts..
- Then you come in and check.

1122
01:09:04,796 --> 01:09:05,854
Look here, you..
- No, please come in.

1123
01:09:06,131 --> 01:09:07,291
Come and see what is in the house.
- Look here..

1124
01:09:07,366 --> 01:09:08,424
You must come!
- But.. look here..

1125
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,489
Look here try and understand..
- No, come.

1126
01:09:09,568 --> 01:09:10,694
What happened?
- What happened?

1127
01:09:10,769 --> 01:09:12,134
He is saying..
- No, no, l..

1128
01:09:12,204 --> 01:09:14,069
There was a robbery somewhere..

1129
01:09:14,139 --> 01:09:15,197
There was a theft somewhere..

1130
01:09:15,273 --> 01:09:16,331
That is why he has come here to..
- Look here.. l..

1131
01:09:16,408 --> 01:09:17,466
..l never said anything like this.

1132
01:09:17,542 --> 01:09:18,600
How come you did not say this?

1133
01:09:18,677 --> 01:09:19,735
You send him in and
tell him to check.

1134
01:09:19,811 --> 01:09:21,073
There is a lot of wealth hidden inside.
- How can they go in and check?

1135
01:09:21,146 --> 01:09:22,204
He does not have a search warrant.

1136
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,338
l will give you the search
warrant.. - That is not..

1137
01:09:23,415 --> 01:09:24,473
l will give you the search
warrant. You go in.

1138
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:25,607
lt is not necessary.

1139
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:27,083
lt is necessary for me.
You send your people in..

1140
01:09:27,152 --> 01:09:28,517
..and tell them to check. Why not?

1141
01:09:29,087 --> 01:09:30,145
Please go!

1142
01:09:31,089 --> 01:09:33,489

Thank you!

1145
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:46,260
Suman, why is this necessary?

1146
01:09:46,605 --> 01:09:48,539
Raju, this is necessary.
He doubts us.

1147
01:09:48,607 --> 01:09:49,665
ls it a small thing?

1148
01:09:51,343 --> 01:09:52,401
Sir!

1149
01:09:55,313 --> 01:09:57,110
Sir! That.. we found the
bag that we had seen..

1150
01:09:57,182 --> 01:09:59,742
..on the CC TV monitor.

1151
01:09:59,818 --> 01:10:01,376
Okay, so you found the bag.

1152
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:02,784
Now you may feel that
there is money inside.

1153
01:10:02,854 --> 01:10:04,116
Open it, open it..
- We will open it.

1154
01:10:04,189 --> 01:10:05,247
Maybe there is money inside. - We

Yes, we will open it just

1158
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:09,785
Unnecessarily, they doubt us.

1159
01:10:24,242 --> 01:10:25,709

1160
01:10:27,712 --> 01:10:31,273

Sir, sir, tell me, can
this really happen?

1164

entire department a member.

Or is this a brochure?

1198
01:12:51,723 --> 01:12:56,626
lf this is money they why do people
see this as a brochure?

1199
01:12:58,330 --> 01:13:02,266
And, god, if this is a brochure then
why do l see this as money?

1200
01:13:03,802 --> 01:13:06,532
This.. what is this?

01:13:07,272 --> 01:13:10,833
ls this a brochure or is this
money or is it a joke?

1202
01:13:11,643 --> 01:13:12,701
What is this?

1203
01:13:22,454 --> 01:13:25,355
Or am l going crazy?

1204
01:13:30,195 --> 01:13:31,526
Or have l already become crazy?

1205
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:44,875
This.. this money.. Oh god,

1206
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,578

Oh, god, what is happening?
Oh, god! Oh, my god!

First tell me what is happening?

1209
01:13:55,887 --> 01:14:01,154
That.. Piddu, the thing is.. that
thing..

1210
01:14:02,227 --> 01:14:04,218
..that.. something..

1211
01:14:05,330 --> 01:14:09,767
When l look at that thing
it seems the same to me.

1212
01:14:10,568 --> 01:14:13,435
But, Piddu, when someone else
looks at that thing..

1213
01:14:16,408 --> 01:14:18,205
..then he feels that,
that is something else.

1214
01:14:18,777 --> 01:14:19,835
l hope you understand.

1215
01:14:20,178 --> 01:14:23,113
l mean to say that it is something..

1216
01:14:23,181 --> 01:14:25,547
.and it seems something else.

1217
01:14:26,451 --> 01:14:27,509
What?

1218
01:14:28,286 --> 01:14:31,380
lt is one thing and it seems
something else, Piddu.

1219
01:14:31,790 --> 01:14:33,223
Buddy, you need not worry at all.

1220
01:14:33,291 --> 01:14:35,452
These things keep happening.
lt is a very normal thing.

1221
01:14:36,227 --> 01:14:37,558
Piddu, what are you saying?

1222
01:14:38,363 --> 01:14:41,696
Look here Rajendra, this world..

1223
01:14:42,133 --> 01:14:44,294
This world does not seem as it is.

1224
01:14:44,669 --> 01:14:47,365
And this world is not as it looks.

1225
01:14:48,273 --> 01:14:49,797
You don't worry, l will prescribe
some medicines for you.

1226
01:14:49,874 --> 01:14:51,136
Will you eat a pizza?

1227
01:14:51,843 --> 01:14:53,140
My friend, you don't understand.

1228
01:14:56,247 --> 01:14:57,305
One minute!

1229
01:14:57,649 --> 01:15:00,812
Eat this in the morning, this in
the afternoon and this at night..

1230
01:15:04,422 --> 01:15:05,480
This.. what is this?

1231
01:15:06,558 --> 01:15:08,458
What?
- What is this?

1232
01:15:09,594 --> 01:15:14,793
Money. - What? This looks
like money to you?

1233
01:15:16,201 --> 01:15:17,532
Yes! What does it seem to you?

1234
01:15:19,471 --> 01:15:20,563
This looks like money to you?

1235
01:15:21,306 --> 01:15:22,773
Yes, what do you see?

1236
01:15:22,841 --> 01:15:24,365
Even l can see that this is money.

1237
01:15:24,442 --> 01:15:25,636
Yes, then what is the problem?

1238
01:15:25,710 --> 01:15:27,234
Piddu, this is the problem.

1239
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:29,647
How can this look like money to you?

1240
01:15:30,281 --> 01:15:31,441
lf money does not look like money..

1241
01:15:31,516 --> 01:15:32,642
..then what else will it look like?

1242
01:15:34,452 --> 01:15:36,784
One minute, l will show you.

1243
01:15:39,758 --> 01:15:40,850
Does all this look
like money to you?

1244
01:15:42,327 --> 01:15:46,787
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! So much money!

1245
01:15:46,865 --> 01:15:48,298
Where did you get this from?

1246
01:15:48,366 --> 01:15:49,560
This looks like money to you?

1247
01:15:50,201 --> 01:15:52,328
Oh, my friend, you are great!

1248
01:15:53,204 --> 01:15:54,330
You have earned this with
your scheme, isn't it?

01:15:54,406 --> 01:15:55,873
You have earned crores of rupees.

1250
01:15:58,143 --> 01:15:59,610
Does this look like money to you?

1251
01:16:00,278 --> 01:16:02,143
lf your sister-in-law hears

inform her. My friend!

1259
01:16:20,165 --> 01:16:22,099
..but you do not listen
to me at all.

Yes, yes, l can see with my
own eyes so much money..

1261
01:16:25,637 --> 01:16:26,695
l cannot even count them.

1262
01:16:27,105 --> 01:16:30,233
Rajendra! Hey, Rajendra!
l will call you later.

1263
01:16:30,308 --> 01:16:32,606
Sister-in-law, congratulations!
At least give me sweets.

01:16:32,677 --> 01:16:34,110
Congratulations? l have still
nor given you the news..

1265
01:16:34,179 --> 01:16:35,578
..that l am going to be a mother.

1266
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:37,111
Brother Rajendra has earned
crores of rupees..

1267
01:16:37,182 --> 01:16:38,342
..from that scheme.

1268
01:16:39,451 --> 01:16:40,611
Minu, what are you saying?

1269
01:16:40,785 --> 01:16:42,650
Come on sister-in-law, now
don't hide it from me.

1270
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:44,119
We are part of the family.

But.. sister-in-law..

1274
01:16:54,732 --> 01:16:56,199
There was a theft of ten crores.

1275
01:16:57,702 --> 01:16:59,465
l want to interrogate
Rajendra Dubey.

1276
01:17:14,419 --> 01:17:15,477
You have committed
a theft, isn't it?

1277
01:17:16,387 --> 01:17:19,151
What? - l cannot even think that
you could do such a deed.

1278
01:17:19,324 --> 01:17:20,723
Suman, l have not done anything.

1279
01:17:21,092 --> 01:17:24,186
Do not lie! l was so proud of
you, you have ruined all that.

1280
01:17:24,262 --> 01:17:25,320
l have not done anything.

1281
01:17:25,396 --> 01:17:26,658
You have not done anything?
Then what is this?

1282
01:17:27,165 --> 01:17:28,723
What is this? Where did you
get these crores of rupees from?

1283
01:17:31,102 --> 01:17:33,093
Don't laugh! Tell me from where
did you get this much money?

1284
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:34,432
To you also this looks like money?

1285
01:17:34,506 --> 01:17:36,201
When you opened it you also money?

1286
01:17:36,274 --> 01:17:38,174
What do you mean? lf it is money
it will look like money.

1287
01:17:38,443 --> 01:17:40,138
Suman, even Piddu could
see this as money.

1288
01:17:42,113 --> 01:17:45,105
Now all this..
- Raju, l am asking you something.

1289
01:17:45,183 --> 01:17:46,241
Where did this money come from?

1290
01:17:48,786 --> 01:17:51,311
Suman, tell me one thing.

1291
01:17:53,291 --> 01:17:56,124
What is this?
- What do you mean by what is this?

1292
01:17:56,194 --> 01:17:57,388
Tell me from where did
you get that money?

1293
01:17:57,795 --> 01:17:59,626
Suman, tell me what is this?

1294
01:18:01,399 --> 01:18:02,457
This is a mug.

1295
01:18:03,535 --> 01:18:05,196
Suman, what makes you
think it's a mug?

1296
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:07,170
Even l can see that this is a mug.

1297
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:09,331
Raju, if it is a mug, it is
bound to be seen as a mug.

1298
01:18:10,241 --> 01:18:12,402
What is this?
- Raju!

1299
01:18:12,477 --> 01:18:13,535
ls this a flower vase?

1300
01:18:14,312 --> 01:18:17,247
And.. and this.. what is this Suman?

1301
01:18:17,482 --> 01:18:19,279
This.. this.. what is this?

1302
01:18:20,285 --> 01:18:21,343
Suman, what is this?

1303
01:18:21,419 --> 01:18:23,080
Raju, everything is
what it looks like.

1304
01:18:23,154 --> 01:18:24,382
This is a paper.
- This.. what is this?

1305
01:18:24,455 --> 01:18:25,513
Raju, what is this?

1306
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:27,421
Suman, what is this?

1307
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:30,319
This is a pillow, this
is a sofa, Suman.

1308
01:18:30,395 --> 01:18:31,453
Raju! Raju, what is the matter?

1309
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:32,587
This is a cushion.

1310
01:18:33,164 --> 01:18:35,155
This is..
- Raju, what is the matter?

1311
01:18:35,233 --> 01:18:37,428
What is wrong? What has happened?

1312
01:18:37,502 --> 01:18:39,629
Suman, l am very scared!

1313
01:18:39,704 --> 01:18:42,366
Suman, l am very scared!
- Nothing! Nothing has happened.

1314
01:18:50,315 --> 01:18:52,180
Mr. Rajendra!
- Yes!

1315
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:54,309
Sir, l want to invest
in your scheme.

1316
01:18:54,385 --> 01:18:55,511
Scheme?
- Yes!

1317
01:18:57,188 --> 01:18:59,452
Look here, that scheme
is closed now.

1318
01:18:59,524 --> 01:19:00,650

1325
01:19:24,816 --> 01:19:27,341
Sir, we would like to
invest in your scheme.

1326
01:19:27,418 --> 01:19:29,249
Look here the scheme
has closed down.

1327
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:30,412
There is no scheme here.
- No, sir!

1328
01:19:30,488 --> 01:19:32,649
All these are rumours. - Sir,
we have even brought the money.

01:19:32,724 --> 01:19:34,658
l do not want any money.

1330
01:19:34,726 --> 01:19:36,091
Sir, please do not do this.

01:19:40,164 --> 01:19:42,098
Sir! Sir! Listen to one thing.

Please take this money!

1335
01:19:44,168 --> 01:19:46,102
Please sir! Please sir!

1336
01:19:46,170 --> 01:19:49,401
Sir, please do not do this!

01:19:49,474 --> 01:19:51,101
Look here, sir! Look here,

01:19:51,175 --> 01:19:52,233

01:20:01,252 --> 01:20:02,310
Sir, please sir!

01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:03,581
Sir, where are you going?

Please!

1345
01:20:04,789 --> 01:20:06,654
Sir, please keep my money!

1346
01:20:06,724 --> 01:20:08,658
Raju! u Sir, please.

1347
01:20:29,380 --> 01:20:33,680
Stop! Mister, where are you
running like P.T. Usha?

1348
01:20:33,751 --> 01:20:35,776
ls someone going to
give you a medal?

1349
01:20:37,221 --> 01:20:38,654
Why did you throw this bag here?

1350
01:20:39,223 --> 01:20:41,384
That..
- l have seen it with my own eyes.

1351
01:20:41,759 --> 01:20:44,592
lt is very difficult
to deceive the law.

1352
01:20:44,829 --> 01:20:46,160
Come on pick up your bag.

1353
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:47,492
You cannot throw it here.

1354
01:20:47,765 --> 01:20:48,823
Why can't l throw it?

1355
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,232
Mister, there is a new
rule in the city.

1356
01:20:51,569 --> 01:20:53,264
That you are forbidden to
throw garbage in the city.

1357
01:20:53,337 --> 01:20:54,634
But, where am l throwing
it in the city?

1358
01:20:54,772 --> 01:20:56,433
l am throwing it in the garbage bin.

1359
01:20:56,507 --> 01:20:59,271
The point is not that you are
throwing it in the garbage.

1360
01:20:59,343 --> 01:21:02,437
The point is what you are
throwing in the garbage.

1361
01:21:02,513 --> 01:21:04,344
l have still not checked
what is in the bag.

1362
01:21:04,415 --> 01:21:06,906
l will have to check. What is in it?

1363
01:21:09,821 --> 01:21:11,311
There is money in this.

1364
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:13,550
How much money?

1365
01:21:14,459 --> 01:21:15,517
Ten crores!

1366
01:21:19,330 --> 01:21:22,197
Brother, do not get
fooled by my face.

1367
01:21:22,266 --> 01:21:23,756
My face is such since childhood.

1368
01:21:24,135 --> 01:21:26,569
l look like this but
l am something else.

1369
01:21:27,705 --> 01:21:32,472
Can you see my hair? They did
not vanish just like that.

1370
01:21:33,244 --> 01:21:35,576
Mister, what do you think?

1371
01:21:36,147 --> 01:21:38,138
That you will throw the
money in the garbage..

1372
01:21:38,216 --> 01:21:40,241
..and l will allow you to do so?

1373
01:21:40,618 --> 01:21:41,812
This can never be.

1374
01:21:41,886 --> 01:21:43,148
This is illegal work.

1375
01:21:43,221 --> 01:21:45,155
What is illegal? lt is my
money, l may throw it..

1376
01:21:45,223 --> 01:21:47,691
..eat it, give it to
someone or burn it.

1377
01:21:47,759 --> 01:21:48,817
What difference does
it make to anyone?

1378
01:21:48,893 --> 01:21:50,554
The population in our
country is 1230 crores.

1379
01:21:50,628 --> 01:21:52,391
People have no money to eat.

1380
01:21:52,463 --> 01:21:54,590
And you are throwing
away money like this?

1381
01:21:54,766 --> 01:21:56,495
Some are throwing money on petrol.

1382
01:21:56,567 --> 01:21:58,501
Some are throwing money on cars.

1383
01:21:58,569 --> 01:21:59,831
Some are investing
money is property.

1384
01:21:59,904 --> 01:22:01,565
Some are investing it
in the share market.

1385
01:22:01,639 --> 01:22:03,903
And you are throwing
money in the garbage?

1386
01:22:04,575 --> 01:22:07,738
Do you know how much this country
is in need of money?

1387
01:22:09,747 --> 01:22:11,180
The country is in need, isn't it?
- Yes!

1388
01:22:12,183 --> 01:22:13,241
Then give this to the country.

1389
01:22:13,317 --> 01:22:19,187
Boss, the police never
pick up thrown money.

1390
01:22:19,457 --> 01:22:23,188
And the government never takes
anyone's obligation.

1391
01:22:23,261 --> 01:22:26,196
Come on pick up! Pick up your
bag and go from here.

1392
01:22:26,264 --> 01:22:28,789
Otherwise l will lock
you up in jail.

1393
01:22:29,767 --> 01:22:31,234
You will put me behind bars?
- Yes!

1394
01:22:32,203 --> 01:22:33,261
That only will be better.

1395
01:22:33,471 --> 01:22:34,699
Mr. Chaudhary!
- Yes!

1396
01:22:34,772 --> 01:22:36,205
You put me behind bars.

1397
01:22:36,274 --> 01:22:38,606
Distressed! Troubled!

1398
01:22:38,676 --> 01:22:41,873
Distressed and troubled god!

1399
01:22:42,213 --> 01:22:43,407
go, l allow you to go.

1400
01:22:43,481 --> 01:22:46,644
The thing is nowadays there is
a crowd in the police station.

1401
01:22:46,818 --> 01:22:48,149
The number of thieves and
crooks have increased..

1402
01:22:48,219 --> 01:22:49,481
..in our country.

1403
01:22:49,554 --> 01:22:50,816
go! l free you! go! go!

1404
01:22:50,888 --> 01:22:53,220
Pick up your bag and
run away from here.

1405
01:22:54,458 --> 01:22:58,451
Oh, god! - Now why are you after
troubling god all the time?

1406
01:22:58,529 --> 01:22:59,587
Distressed! Troubled!
- l will tell you what to do.

1407
01:22:59,664 --> 01:23:01,256
Distressed and troubled god!
- You do one thing.

1408
01:23:01,666 --> 01:23:04,157
You pick up this bag, take
the money, go home..

1409
01:23:04,235 --> 01:23:06,635
..and stay happily with
your wife and children.

1410
01:23:06,704 --> 01:23:07,796
Earn good deeds.

1411
01:23:10,741 --> 01:23:11,799
l should earn good deeds?
- Yes!

1412
01:23:12,643 --> 01:23:14,508
You have given me a very good idea.

1413
01:23:15,446 --> 01:23:17,414
Thank you god! Thank you,
Mr. Chaudhary.

1414
01:23:17,715 --> 01:23:19,342
Now l will earn good deeds.

1415
01:23:20,484 --> 01:23:21,542
All the best.

1416
01:23:22,787 --> 01:23:24,618
People do not understand
such a simple thing.

1417
01:23:27,225 --> 01:23:29,193
Hi! What happened?

1418
01:23:32,296 --> 01:23:35,288
What do you wish?
- Oh, what do you wish?

1419
01:23:36,434 --> 01:23:38,129
Have you seen his condition?
He is going around..

1420
01:23:38,202 --> 01:23:39,396
..like a crazy man.

1421
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:42,462
You can see his condition. You
cannot see my condition?

1422
01:23:42,707 --> 01:23:44,140
Eating so much due to depression..

1423
01:23:44,208 --> 01:23:45,266
..this is my condition now.

1424
01:23:45,843 --> 01:23:47,140
l don't even know where he is.
ln which condition he is..

1425
01:23:47,211 --> 01:23:48,803
..and where has he gone?

1426
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,871
Oh my, how much you cry.

1427
01:23:51,549 --> 01:23:53,483
All this is happening because
you cry so much.

1428
01:23:54,452 --> 01:23:56,511
What should l do? Tell me,
what should l do?

1429
01:23:56,587 --> 01:23:59,454
First of all, you stop crying.
Stop crying.

1430
01:24:00,358 --> 01:24:01,825
Now see this, this too is finished.

1431
01:24:01,893 --> 01:24:03,326
What should l do?

1432
01:24:04,228 --> 01:24:06,355
He is going insane right
in front of my eyes.

1433
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:07,658
And l cannot do anything.

1434
01:24:07,732 --> 01:24:11,259
Look here Suman, just
try and understand.

1435
01:24:11,335 --> 01:24:13,769
l think all this is happening
because of me.

1436
01:24:13,838 --> 01:24:15,100
lt is not like..
- l am responsible.

1437
01:24:15,172 --> 01:24:16,264
lt is not like that.

1438
01:24:18,342 --> 01:24:20,276
l encouraged his obsession.

1439
01:24:21,178 --> 01:24:23,373
Everyone said.. everyone said
something or the other.

1440
01:24:23,447 --> 01:24:25,438
And l blindly supported him.

1441
01:24:25,516 --> 01:24:27,416
Do you have the need
to listen to anyone?

1442
01:24:27,485 --> 01:24:29,476
Now just see, what has
happened of our life.

1443
01:24:30,187 --> 01:24:32,121
Look here, just.. just take it easy.

1444
01:24:32,189 --> 01:24:36,558
Oh god, please.. please help me.
- l will help you!

1445
01:24:36,761 --> 01:24:38,353
Make him normal as he was.

1446
01:24:38,429 --> 01:24:42,126
l.. l will do it. l.. l'll - l will
never ask you for anything else.

1447
01:24:42,199 --> 01:24:45,225
l.. l will do it, don't cry.
l will do it. Please.

1448
01:24:45,303 --> 01:24:47,464
Please make him normal as before.

1449
01:24:47,538 --> 01:24:49,199
l am telling you l will do it.

1450
01:24:49,273 --> 01:24:53,141
Look here Suman.. please don't..
please don't do this.

1451
01:24:53,544 --> 01:24:55,808
Please! Please Suman.

1452
01:24:56,347 --> 01:24:57,780
Please god!

1453
01:25:00,384 --> 01:25:02,215
Can l have a glass
of water to drink?

1454
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:07,849
Thank you!

1455
01:25:41,692 --> 01:25:44,183
Oh, god, what is happening?

1456
01:25:45,196 --> 01:25:46,663
l don't understand anything.

1457
01:25:50,368 --> 01:25:51,494
l cannot understand anything.

1458
01:25:57,341 --> 01:25:59,707
What problems have
you landed me into?

1459
01:26:08,619 --> 01:26:11,281
You have landed me into
this trouble, isn't it?

1460
01:26:12,156 --> 01:26:13,214
You have done this, isn't it?

1461
01:26:14,392 --> 01:26:18,192
So, then, l will leave this
problem with you.

1462
01:26:18,429 --> 01:26:20,727
That will be right. Yes,
that will be fine.

1463
01:26:21,232 --> 01:26:22,824
l will give you all this.

1464
01:26:24,502 --> 01:26:25,696
No one else is taking this.

1465
01:26:26,203 --> 01:26:28,763
You take away all this
money. l don't want this.

1466
01:26:35,179 --> 01:26:36,669
Now, l will be able to rest in peace.

1467
01:26:37,848 --> 01:26:39,543
This is the root cause of
all problems, isn't it?

1468
01:26:41,252 --> 01:26:43,277
Money! Money! Money! Money!

1469
01:26:43,788 --> 01:26:48,851
Take this! Take this!
All run after money.

1470
01:26:49,393 --> 01:26:51,452
Did l ever ask you for money?

1471
01:26:51,529 --> 01:26:54,191
l told you that l will
earn my own money.

1472
01:26:55,132 --> 01:26:56,190
Take this!

1473
01:27:58,729 --> 01:28:00,287
What drama are you playing?

1474
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:02,563
What games are you playing with me?

1475
01:28:03,234 --> 01:28:05,202
You too do not want the money back?

1476
01:28:06,704 --> 01:28:08,638
l know what l have to
do with this money.

1477
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:10,605
l know what l have to do.

1478
01:28:36,734 --> 01:28:40,500
So much money! Take this! Take this!

1479
01:28:41,405 --> 01:28:44,306
Take this! Take this money!

1480
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:47,208
This is not money, this is
just paper! Just paper!

1481
01:28:47,278 --> 01:28:49,109
You also take this.

1482
01:28:49,180 --> 01:28:52,513
This is just paper!
- Just paper!

1483
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:55,381
Hey, keep this. u No..

1484
01:28:55,452 --> 01:28:59,252
Hey, we don't want your money.

1485
01:29:01,192 --> 01:29:03,126
Why is he giving it to everyone?
- Hey, has he gone crazy?

1486
01:29:03,194 --> 01:29:06,129
Take this! Take some more! Some more!

1487
01:29:06,197 --> 01:29:08,131
Hey you! What are you doing?

1488
01:29:08,199 --> 01:29:10,190
Take away all the money.

1489
01:29:10,267 --> 01:29:12,132
Hey, you, does this look
like money to you?

1490
01:29:22,179 --> 01:29:24,170
l do not want any money!
l don't want money.

1491
01:29:25,182 --> 01:29:28,174
l don't want money.

1492
01:29:37,695 --> 01:29:40,596
l don't want money.
l don't want anything.

1493
01:29:44,568 --> 01:29:46,763
l don't want money.
l don't want anything.

1494
01:30:56,373 --> 01:30:58,898
good morning, Rajendra! How are you?

1495
01:31:01,245 --> 01:31:02,337
Doctor, l am fine.

1496
01:31:03,914 --> 01:31:05,905
Rajendra, why are you fine?

1497
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:08,810
Because l am happy.

1498
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:12,450
Because happiness is
under my control.

1499
01:31:17,194 --> 01:31:21,358
Find your happiness in others.

1500
01:31:22,599 --> 01:31:25,466
Spread your happiness
and make others happy.

1501
01:31:29,807 --> 01:31:32,241
lt is very nice! Have
you written it?

1502
01:31:33,310 --> 01:31:36,802
No! This is written
by Shankar Prasad.

1503
01:31:40,384 --> 01:31:42,511
good progress, keep it up.

1504
01:31:57,835 --> 01:32:00,633
Please discuss everything
before Friday's meeting.

1505
01:32:04,842 --> 01:32:07,834
Yes! So! No, no, no!

1506
01:32:07,911 --> 01:32:10,379
Sumi, dear! Come! Come!

1507
01:32:10,781 --> 01:32:12,112
Hi, uncle! - Come.

1508
01:32:19,123 --> 01:32:21,216
Come, l will play with
you. Papa is busy.

1509
01:32:23,193 --> 01:32:25,127
go and play with him. Take it Piddu.

1510
01:32:25,796 --> 01:32:26,854
Catch!

1511
01:32:31,135 --> 01:32:32,534
Sir, work always goes on.

1512
01:32:33,237 --> 01:32:35,364
Sir, money is not
everything in life.

1513
01:32:36,273 --> 01:32:39,265
And these moments, once they pass
away, they will never return.

1514
01:32:39,343 --> 01:32:41,334
This is the best scheme of life.

1515
01:32:41,812 --> 01:32:43,507
Sorry! Come on!

1516
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:44,638
Sir, shall we go?

1517
01:32:45,516 --> 01:32:48,314
What are you doing, hurry up!
We are getting late.

1518
01:32:48,552 --> 01:32:49,678
getting late! Come on,
come on, come on!

1519
01:32:49,753 --> 01:32:50,811
Come on, Minu!

1520
01:32:51,555 --> 01:32:52,613
We are ready!

1521
01:32:52,689 --> 01:32:53,815
Come on, look there!

1522
01:32:53,891 --> 01:32:55,882
Come on, we are getting late.

1523
01:32:56,894 --> 01:33:01,263
You sit here and you come here.
Come and sit here.

1524
01:33:01,465 --> 01:33:02,523
What are you doing?

1525
01:33:02,599 --> 01:33:04,157
What else can l do? l will
make you sit in my lap..

1526
01:33:04,234 --> 01:33:05,633
..and love you. Please come.

1527
01:33:07,404 --> 01:33:08,666
Very good!

1528
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:10,698
Come on, sir!

1529
01:33:21,752 --> 01:33:25,711
A human being runs after
happiness all his life.

1530
01:33:26,590 --> 01:33:28,455
But a thing to understand is..

1531
01:33:29,626 --> 01:33:33,118
lt is in the hands of
the human beings to..

1532
01:33:33,197 --> 01:33:36,689
..change happiness into sorrow
or sorrow into happiness.

1533
01:33:37,267 --> 01:33:40,430
And this is the biggest lesson
or a test for a human being.

1534
01:33:40,771 --> 01:33:43,865
But, do not think that
this exam is so easy.

1535
01:33:46,243 --> 01:33:49,144
Rajendra learnt his lesson
at the right time..

1536
01:33:49,213 --> 01:33:52,307
..and in the right way.

1537
01:33:52,816 --> 01:33:55,341
Now, let us see whether
you can do this or not?

1538
01:33:56,286 --> 01:33:59,312
Be ready! l am coming!

1539
01:34:00,824 --> 01:34:02,883
Wonder who it is amongst all of you!

1540
01:34:06,597 --> 01:34:07,655
Child!

1541
01:34:11,335 --> 01:34:14,668
Oh, you child, listen!

1542
01:34:21,178 --> 01:34:26,115
Why do you shout when you
are getting a load?

1543
01:34:26,183 --> 01:34:27,377
There is confusion in your mind.

1544
01:34:27,451 --> 01:34:29,180
Open the gates of destiny.

1545
01:34:29,253 --> 01:34:30,311
Oh, my god!

1546
01:34:30,554 --> 01:34:31,646
Oh my god!

1547
01:34:32,189 --> 01:34:33,315
Oh, my god!

1548
01:34:33,724 --> 01:34:34,782
Oh, my god!

1549
01:34:37,427 --> 01:34:40,396
Oh, my god, what commotion is this?

1550
01:34:40,464 --> 01:34:43,729
This craze for money has put
me in a terrible state.

1551
01:34:43,867 --> 01:34:46,802
Oh, my child, this money is
something great.

1552
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:50,567
Stop making a commotion
and become wealthy.

1553
01:34:50,641 --> 01:34:53,474
Day and night, why do
you think so much?

1554
01:34:53,544 --> 01:34:56,877
Take this money! Take this money!

1555
01:34:57,214 --> 01:35:00,206
Why do you fear unnecessarily?

1556
01:35:00,284 --> 01:35:03,481
Take this money! Take this money!

1557
01:35:03,587 --> 01:35:06,750
This money rules the world.

1558
01:35:06,823 --> 01:35:10,156
This money values the rupee.

1559
01:35:10,227 --> 01:35:13,196
Take this money! Take this money!

1560
01:35:13,263 --> 01:35:16,562
Take this money! Take this money!

1561
01:35:16,633 --> 01:35:19,261
What l say is the truth.

1562
01:35:19,336 --> 01:35:21,770
Just the truth and nothing
but the truth.

1563
01:35:22,773 --> 01:35:25,173
This is money!

1564
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:40,679
The car, bungalow and motorcar.

1565
01:35:40,757 --> 01:35:42,349
You can fulfill your
dreams with this.

1566
01:35:42,426 --> 01:35:45,259
Why don't you listen to me?

1567
01:35:45,329 --> 01:35:48,457
Whatever you say, l
will be your guest.

1568
01:35:48,532 --> 01:35:50,295
Oh, god, l made a mistake.

1569
01:35:50,367 --> 01:35:52,198
Now, let me live in peace.

1570
01:35:52,269 --> 01:35:55,238
Why don't you take
it when you get it?

1571
01:35:55,305 --> 01:35:58,365
Why are you so troubled?

1572
01:35:58,442 --> 01:35:59,636
Oh, my god!

1573
01:35:59,710 --> 01:36:01,337
Oh, my god!

1574
01:36:01,411 --> 01:36:03,140
Oh, my god!

1575
01:36:03,213 --> 01:36:04,612
Oh, my god!
