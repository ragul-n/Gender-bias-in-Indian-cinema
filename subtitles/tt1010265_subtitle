1
00:00:53,796 --> 00:00:55,912
Ruth?

2
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:06,469
Ruth?

3
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:09,548
Are you home?

4
00:01:14,277 --> 00:01:16,507
Ruth?

5
00:01:20,877 --> 00:01:24,347
Ruth?
Are you hungry?

6
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:38,509
I'm preparing food, do you want some?

7
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:04,593
Ruth!

8
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:26,268
- No, this can't be right.
- What?

9
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:29,829
- Simon lives here.
- Simon?

10
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:35,471
Simon Follnes at Disturbance Patrol,
a colleague. Of both of us.

11
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,553
She's been living
in a flatshare downtown.

12
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:46,517
They hadn't seen her since yesterday.

13
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,229
Preferred to be found by mum and dad,
I guess.

14
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,990
Simon...

15
00:03:59,601 --> 00:04:01,751
Simon.

16
00:04:02,001 --> 00:04:03,878
No!

17
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,076
No!

18
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:14,152
No!

19
00:04:14,241 --> 00:04:21,431
VARG VEUM
FALLEN ANGELS

20
00:04:56,682 --> 00:05:00,038
Insurance fraud. In Poland.

21
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:39,193
Varg?

22
00:05:40,484 --> 00:05:44,523
- Hey!
- Hi! Haven't seen you in ages.

23
00:05:46,964 --> 00:05:50,752
- Are you doing okay?
- Sure. And you? And your...

24
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:55,474
Fine. Really great.
I'm working a lot and...

25
00:05:55,564 --> 00:06:01,002
It's going really well
for Jacob and the others.

26
00:06:01,084 --> 00:06:04,394
You haven't changed a bit.

27
00:06:05,484 --> 00:06:08,521
- Rebecca?
- Coming!

28
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:13,595
- Say hello to him, then.
- I will.

29
00:06:15,284 --> 00:06:20,917
Jacob's band is playing at
the Wharf tonight. Why don't you come?

30
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:28,241
- I have to work. Perhaps another time?
- You haven't changed much you either.

31
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:57,436
- You came!
- Yeah.

32
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:04,400
Thank you all.

33
00:07:04,486 --> 00:07:11,198
This next song is about what we want,
who we want, and how we want it.

34
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:24,397
- He seems to be enjoying himself!
- He looks great on stage.

35
00:07:24,486 --> 00:07:28,365
Remember the
Jane's Addiction concert in London?

36
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:34,602
Jacob was standing next to us.
Then he turned towards us...

37
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:40,000
- He goes like this: "See that...?"
- "That's me in a few years."

38
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:52,876
Look who's here, it's Derrick!
Have we done anything wrong or what?

39
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,322
Hello, Jacob.

40
00:07:56,407 --> 00:08:02,277
We must have done something wrong.
You never show up when we invite you.

41
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:06,724
- Great to see you, man!
- Likewise.

42
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,403
- What do you think?
- You were great.

43
00:08:11,487 --> 00:08:15,640
Don't lie to me.
I know it's not your sort of thing.

44
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:18,447
Varg! Hello!

45
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:28,077
Hi! Am I interrupting the male bonding,
or what?

46
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:32,241
- We're just talking about old times.
- Will you come for a drink with us?

47
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:38,198
Of course he will. Now we're really
going to make up for lost time!

48
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:48,205
Why don't you go on ahead,
I'll just have a smoke with Varg.

49
00:08:49,888 --> 00:08:53,643
- What's next? Going on tour?
- Yeah.

50
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:57,517
- For how long?
- Eight weeks.

51
00:08:57,609 --> 00:09:01,158
What does she say to that?

52
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:06,327
She cheats on me.

53
00:09:09,969 --> 00:09:13,644
- Did she say so?
- No, I just know.

54
00:09:13,729 --> 00:09:16,801
You just know?

55
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:21,519
Or I think I know.
That's the problem, really.

56
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:27,047
And I can't take it any longer.
I must know.

57
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:32,049
- Forget it!
- Isn't that what people like you do?

58
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,600
What? People like me? Eh?

59
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:44,639
Are you seeing someone special?

60
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,242
Then you would've known
what I'm going through.

61
00:11:12,252 --> 00:11:17,884
Hi! I haven't seen you for years,
then all of a sudden twice in a week.

62
00:11:17,972 --> 00:11:21,931
Are you following me around or what?

63
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,651
- Are you spying on me?
- Rebecca...

64
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:33,088
Damn you!

65
00:11:37,293 --> 00:11:41,491
- It's Jacob, isn't it?
- I felt I owed it to him.

66
00:11:41,573 --> 00:11:44,770
I've done something stupid,
I'm sorry.

67
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:48,607
He can be very persuasive.

68
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:54,846
But I just hadn't thought
he would go this far.

69
00:11:54,933 --> 00:11:58,608
It looks a bit
like he has his reasons.

70
00:11:58,693 --> 00:12:00,843
What do you know about relationships,
Varg?

71
00:12:00,933 --> 00:12:04,449
Sometimes I just need to get away,
and then I come here.

72
00:12:04,534 --> 00:12:10,848
Do you think you can take a snapshot or
two, and then that should make it true?

73
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,329
No, that was silly of me.

74
00:12:21,814 --> 00:12:26,444
Do you get paid per hour for this,
or what?

75
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:34,566
I remember you took a lot of pictures.

76
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:37,930
Had known you for two weeks,
and you started ordering us around.

77
00:12:38,014 --> 00:12:42,486
You made us pose at the churchyard
with moody dark looks.

78
00:12:42,575 --> 00:12:49,572
You can do that when you're twenty
and have been to a photo work shop.

79
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:54,613
- Are these yours?
- Yes, do you like them?

80
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:59,528
Yes. You should make more like these.

81
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:06,134
But I will have to shoot
anorectic models for a few more years.

82
00:13:15,895 --> 00:13:19,969
Do you ever think about London?

83
00:13:20,056 --> 00:13:25,084
That things could have been different?

84
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:32,969
It was a mistake.

85
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:37,174
Rebecca...
We don't even have to talk about it.

86
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:41,329
You never think about me?

87
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,805
- I have to go now.
- So go then!

88
00:13:43,896 --> 00:13:47,889
Try to understand.
You were my best friend's girlfriend.

89
00:13:47,976 --> 00:13:53,846
I'm sorry. That was totally out
of line. Tell me about your life, then.

90
00:13:53,936 --> 00:14:00,172
It's not every day I receive the visit
of a private investigator.

91
00:14:47,618 --> 00:14:50,655
Don't do this again.

92
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:55,895
Rebecca, you're married to Jacob.

93
00:15:06,578 --> 00:15:10,810
It's not about that. Not any more.

94
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:16,458
You're just afraid.

95
00:18:15,023 --> 00:18:18,299
Come on then!

96
00:18:31,104 --> 00:18:34,141
- Nothing?
- Doesn't look promising.

97
00:18:34,224 --> 00:18:39,901
It seems he made sure to stay
on the gravel. No traces.

98
00:19:27,705 --> 00:19:33,701
It's a nice house, huh?
Great location and...

99
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:51,299
What were you doing here exactly?

100
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:54,298
I was on a job.

101
00:19:55,786 --> 00:20:00,576
She was the wife of a friend of mine.
He suspected her of cheating on him.

102
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,659
I thought you didn't do this sort
of prying into people's sex lives?

103
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:09,866
I just wanted to reassure him.
That he was wrong.

104
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:16,018
Was he wrong?

105
00:20:20,027 --> 00:20:23,940
And she was alone?

106
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:27,941
What about the car?

107
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:33,704
It was dark - black, no blue.
Blue, I think. An estate car.

108
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,783
All right.

109
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:42,416
Are you coming inside with us?

110
00:21:02,588 --> 00:21:05,625
What was the last thing you saw?

111
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:09,621
She was hanging in his arms
like a rag doll.

112
00:21:09,708 --> 00:21:14,259
- He must have knocked her unconscious.
- No signs of a fight.

113
00:21:14,348 --> 00:21:18,307
One would assume that she struggled
before she was put up like that.

114
00:21:18,388 --> 00:21:22,779
The only thing I've found
is this mark here.

115
00:21:24,028 --> 00:21:26,667
He must have attacked her from behind.

116
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:31,663
The thumb here and the other
fingers on the other side. Like this.

117
00:21:39,189 --> 00:21:45,139
- What is this here?
- Some first drops of blood.

118
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:48,062
It's from a mask.

119
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:53,903
He drugged her first, but why?

120
00:21:58,069 --> 00:22:03,587
And the white dress?
Was she wearing that earlier today?

121
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:05,580
No.

122
00:22:05,669 --> 00:22:09,139
Did you see her change
into the white dress?

123
00:22:09,229 --> 00:22:14,463
Have you spoken to Jacob?
Her husband?

124
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:21,262
He will be questioned in Oslo today.
He's flying back tomorrow.

125
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:33,580
They said you were
the one who found her. Was she...?

126
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:38,949
Nothing indicates
she felt any pain, Jacob.

127
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,943
This just can't be true. Hanged?

128
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:08,147
What about... what I asked you to do?

129
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:13,783
- Does that matter now?
- It matters more than ever before.

130
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:18,789
I saw nothing.

131
00:23:21,111 --> 00:23:24,342
Are you sure?

132
00:23:28,712 --> 00:23:32,421
So I had no reason to distrust her.

133
00:23:36,472 --> 00:23:40,181
- Do you want me to drive you anywhere?
- I just want to get home.

134
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:44,584
- The police are still working there...
- I want to go home, Varg.

135
00:23:50,192 --> 00:23:53,423
I'm glad that you're here.

136
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:27,989
Aren't you going to answer?

137
00:24:28,553 --> 00:24:32,865
Are you here on an official business?

138
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:48,106
This is Ruth Follnes,
the daughter of a colleague of mine.

139
00:24:49,194 --> 00:24:53,790
Until yesterday
we assumed it was suicide.

140
00:24:55,674 --> 00:25:00,065
- Two identical murders?
- For the moment, yes.

141
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:02,793
One thing doesn't ring right.
Rebecca had sex before she was killed.

142
00:25:02,874 --> 00:25:05,786
And Ruth didn't.

143
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:12,991
Are we barking up the wrong tree
trying to find a connection?

144
00:25:13,074 --> 00:25:16,066
Or is your statement inaccurate?

145
00:25:16,154 --> 00:25:20,511
- Rebecca wasn't alone.
- Oh no?

146
00:25:23,195 --> 00:25:26,551
Who was with her then?

147
00:25:27,395 --> 00:25:30,671
I was.

148
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:38,504
Now I'm here on official business.

149
00:25:54,435 --> 00:25:59,304
Are you the idiot
or do you think I am one?

150
00:25:59,395 --> 00:26:02,706
- What happens now?
- I'm just sitting here thinking.

151
00:26:02,796 --> 00:26:04,229
About...?

152
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:07,672
Shall I charge you
with giving a false statement?

153
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:14,104
- Why don't you?
- Its a quite common fantasy.

154
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:17,825
What is? Charging people
with giving a false statement?

155
00:26:17,916 --> 00:26:21,465
Sleeping with your best friend's wife.

156
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:27,904
But unlike you, we have a little more
self-discipline, don't we, Isachsen?

157
00:26:30,316 --> 00:26:35,948
- For how long has this been going on?
- It's not the way you think, Hamre.

158
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,708
Well, I'm waiting.

159
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:50,952
We slept together many years ago,
in London, after a night out drinking.

160
00:26:51,037 --> 00:26:54,996
It should never have happened.

161
00:26:55,077 --> 00:26:58,035
Since then
we've hardly had any contact.

162
00:26:58,117 --> 00:27:00,836
- Not until yesterday?
- Not until yesterday.

163
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:05,786
A few glasses of wine and some old
memories and the fire is rekindled?

164
00:27:05,877 --> 00:27:10,393
I didn't know you to be so passionate,
Veum.

165
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:19,307
Jacob has had a tough time lately.
I wonder, would it be possible to...

166
00:27:19,398 --> 00:27:22,117
...not mention
this thing with his wife?

167
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:24,234
Something like that.

168
00:27:24,318 --> 00:27:28,755
This is a murder investigation, Veum.
I don't care about your sex life.

169
00:27:35,638 --> 00:27:40,951
So what if it wasn't sex?
And it wasn't sadism?

170
00:27:42,718 --> 00:27:47,746
- What does he get from it then?
- Are you asking me?

171
00:27:47,838 --> 00:27:50,989
I'm asking you.

172
00:27:57,479 --> 00:28:03,588
There's something with the way they are
hanged. So white, clean and innocent.

173
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,548
It's quite theatrical...

174
00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:11,631
As if he's trying to say something.

175
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:15,075
Quite an unusual way of communicating,
wouldn't you say?

176
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:18,196
Killing might not be the main point.

177
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,668
The murders might be the means
to obtain what he really wants.

178
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:23,671
And what does he really want?

179
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:26,114
In any case
he's addressing an audience.

180
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:31,193
He's considerate towards his victims.
A real gentleman, you might say.

181
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,750
Do you know how he drugged them?

182
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,674
With Rebecca it was gas,
and with Ruth pills.

183
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,911
Enough to knock out a horse.

184
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,390
What kind of pills?

185
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,031
Simon, you're on sick leave.
Do you realize that?

186
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,680
I want to do my bit.

187
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,915
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Go home to your wife.

188
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,356
She's already back at work.

189
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,560
Sitting staring at the wall
doesn't make things any better.

190
00:29:15,761 --> 00:29:19,549
There's got to be something I can do?

191
00:29:21,521 --> 00:29:27,437
Talk to Syversen.
But nothing related to the case.

192
00:29:28,521 --> 00:29:33,037
It was lithium.
The pills, it was lithium.

193
00:29:34,681 --> 00:29:38,959
Supposed to relieve mood swings.

194
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:32,235
- Have you seen this woman before?
- Rebecca is here quite often.

195
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:35,839
- She's here? In what way?
- As a guest.

196
00:31:35,924 --> 00:31:39,360
She often spent the night here?

197
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:43,040
About once a month, perhaps.
Mostly at weekends.

198
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:46,356
Alone, or what?

199
00:31:46,445 --> 00:31:50,324
She mostly comes alone. I've never
seen her arrive with someone.

200
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:54,318
There's been some talk about goings on
in the corridors, but... I don't know.

201
00:31:54,405 --> 00:31:57,795
As far as I know,
I don't think she has a boyfriend.

202
00:31:57,885 --> 00:32:01,002
How about this girl?

203
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,202
Have you seen her
and Rebecca together?

204
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:08,756
No. What's the matter with her?
Is she ill or something?

205
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:22,641
Excuse me! Do you know a girl called
Ruth who lived here in a flatshare?

206
00:32:22,726 --> 00:32:25,798
- Are you from the police?
- No.

207
00:32:25,886 --> 00:32:29,674
- Then you must be a journalist?
- No.

208
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:36,442
So what is it you want then?

209
00:32:38,966 --> 00:32:43,482
I don't really have the time.
I'm off to work.

210
00:32:53,926 --> 00:32:56,486
Why did she move out?

211
00:32:56,566 --> 00:33:01,118
It didn't work out.
She was totally fucked up.

212
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:05,564
- So finally we threw her out.
- When was that?

213
00:33:05,647 --> 00:33:08,286
Three weeks ago.

214
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:11,279
Do you know where she stayed
after that?

215
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:15,724
She's must have been sleeping around,
I guess.

216
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:21,082
What was her problem?

217
00:33:23,727 --> 00:33:29,518
- Are you sure you're not a cop?
- Do I look like one?

218
00:33:44,048 --> 00:33:47,358
Here.
You can just press "play".

219
00:33:49,888 --> 00:33:55,997
She stopped taking her medicine, I
think. She said the pills made her fat.

220
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:58,363
It seemed to me she was getting more
and more spaced out.

221
00:33:58,448 --> 00:34:03,078
I even started feeling afraid of her.

222
00:34:03,168 --> 00:34:07,207
- Why did you film this?
- To show her.

223
00:34:07,288 --> 00:34:13,477
I thought that maybe if she could
see this, it would make her realize.

224
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:23,157
Had she been diagnosed?

225
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:26,161
Manic-depressive.

226
00:34:27,129 --> 00:34:31,088
She received treatment, which seemed
to help. Or so the parents said.

227
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:34,798
The friend said she stopped taking
her medicine and got worse than ever.

228
00:34:34,889 --> 00:34:41,761
People described her as extremely
destructive. Sexual self-mutilation.

229
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:49,559
She was banned from several clubs.
Went to bed with just anyone.

230
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:59,607
What about the footprint?
Find anything?

231
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:04,725
- A standard army boot.
- A very common kind of footwear.

232
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:11,886
Yes, but it's damaged here - see that?
On the outside the sole is worn flat.

233
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,361
He stalks the victims beforehand.

234
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,763
Which means they are carefully chosen
and not picked at random.

235
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:29,406
- Fallen angels.
- Sorry?

236
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:34,724
Like in the Bible. The fallen angels
were thrown out of heaven.

237
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:39,885
They were pure and elevated,
but then they misused their free will.

238
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:44,169
Tell me, have you joined
a sect or something?

239
00:35:44,251 --> 00:35:47,880
What if the murderer sees himself
as some kind of divine executioner.

240
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,166
He sees it as his duty to kill women.

241
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:54,290
Soiled, apostate,
hence promiscuous women.

242
00:35:54,371 --> 00:35:58,808
- Was Ruth a prostitute?
- In the eyes of the murderer.

243
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:02,406
And Rebecca?

244
00:36:12,972 --> 00:36:14,769
Hi.

245
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:29,323
Rebecca was a regular guest
at Park Hotel.

246
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:36,971
Do you know who I've been
thinking of a lot? Eric Clapton.

247
00:36:37,052 --> 00:36:41,842
He lost his son
and writes this just amazing song.

248
00:36:41,932 --> 00:36:46,050
I think it must have
made it easier for him.

249
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:49,489
I'm not able to work at all.

250
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:57,725
Jacob. Did you know she stayed
at that hotel?

251
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:10,045
Sometimes she left,
and sometimes I left.

252
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:12,966
Isn't that the way it is
in a relationship?

253
00:37:13,053 --> 00:37:17,968
You must have wondered
what she was up to.

254
00:37:18,053 --> 00:37:20,647
People were talking at the hotel.

255
00:37:20,733 --> 00:37:23,850
Am I supposed
to start doubting her now?

256
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:28,132
You said it yourself,
it doesn't matter.

257
00:37:30,814 --> 00:37:35,365
Rebecca is dead,
and I'm a paranoid idiot.

258
00:37:42,934 --> 00:37:48,452
- We had a lot of fun, the three of us.
- We did.

259
00:37:52,894 --> 00:37:57,206
Shall we go
and have a beer or something?

260
00:37:57,294 --> 00:38:01,003
- No.
- Only if you had the time, of course.

261
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:10,374
Varg?

262
00:38:13,415 --> 00:38:16,930
Find the fucker who did it.

263
00:38:35,295 --> 00:38:39,334
Now we can welcome a popular guy,
he has just released...

264
00:38:39,415 --> 00:38:41,406
There he is!

265
00:38:41,495 --> 00:38:47,492
Ladies and gentlemen, please give him
a warm hand... Johnny Solheim!

266
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:59,055
- Hello, Johnny.
- Hi, daddy!

267
00:38:59,136 --> 00:39:00,967
- How are things?
- Great!

268
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:07,211
You're out now with your second album,
"Good To Be Back". Why that title?

269
00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:12,086
Well, what happened was that I went to
the States to record the album there.

270
00:39:12,176 --> 00:39:15,486
You were in Nashville, weren't you?

271
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:30,568
...came in as number one.

272
00:39:35,937 --> 00:39:39,691
- Mum, come on!
- Yes, I'm coming.

273
00:39:49,857 --> 00:39:51,848
- Stine?
- Yes.

274
00:39:51,937 --> 00:39:56,453
- Did you go into the garden?
- No. Come then!

275
00:40:00,658 --> 00:40:08,497
But, Johnny, we've been told that you
didn't come back from America alone...

276
00:40:08,578 --> 00:40:15,848
...we must... watch this now - because
Johnny bought an old Chevrolet 77.

277
00:40:15,938 --> 00:40:17,087
That's right, an lmpala.

278
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:19,089
An lmpala.
Wow, look at that.

279
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:24,935
A reliable source tells me
it has rust problems and cracked seats.

280
00:40:25,018 --> 00:40:27,168
What makes you buy such a car?

281
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,011
Well, its a little piece of Nashville,
isn't it?

282
00:40:30,098 --> 00:40:32,851
So it was like
a love at first sight thing?

283
00:40:32,938 --> 00:40:38,457
I would rather picture you
in a Ford Mustang or something.

284
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:51,293
Hello?

285
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,413
I have to be careful now so my wife
doesn't lock me out of the house.

286
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:28,539
You could always sleep in the car,
there's enough room there.

287
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,579
Best of luck to you!
Johnny Solheim, ladies and gentlemen.

288
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,209
Mum, you missed the whole thing!

289
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,569
Mum?

290
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,855
Mummy?

291
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,936
Mummy?

292
00:42:42,262 --> 00:42:46,050
Stine!
Stine!

293
00:42:47,182 --> 00:42:49,457
Stine...!

294
00:42:52,462 --> 00:42:54,657
Stine!

295
00:42:55,862 --> 00:42:58,137
Stine!

296
00:43:40,343 --> 00:43:42,903
Varg speaking.

297
00:43:42,983 --> 00:43:49,173
Your theory about fallen angels,
that one we can just forget.

298
00:44:04,504 --> 00:44:07,337
Hamre called me.

299
00:44:39,425 --> 00:44:42,417
That's Johnny.

300
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:53,985
Johnny?

301
00:44:55,825 --> 00:44:59,215
Johnny, you must come home.

302
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:03,297
It's Stine.

303
00:45:23,386 --> 00:45:27,823
We have nothing, we know nothing.

304
00:45:27,906 --> 00:45:31,137
A ghost just passed through here.

305
00:45:31,226 --> 00:45:36,983
We still know several things about him.
He's intelligent, well organized.

306
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:41,617
He's got to do this. It's a mission
he must accomplish while he still can.

307
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:44,016
You don't say.

308
00:45:44,107 --> 00:45:47,577
This is still about guilt.
The dresses, all the symbols.

309
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:54,459
She was eight, Veum. The only thing
she's guilty of is being born.

310
00:45:57,987 --> 00:46:00,182
You can go home.

311
00:46:25,228 --> 00:46:29,983
- Varg?
- I've done something very stupid.

312
00:46:31,108 --> 00:46:34,259
- I've got to talk to you.
- Now? In the middle of the night?

313
00:46:34,348 --> 00:46:40,787
- I have to get up early tomorrow.
- I have to tell you something.

314
00:46:43,748 --> 00:46:48,538
- Could it wait until tomorrow?
- Just forget it, Jacob.

315
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:53,945
Varg! Wait.

316
00:46:55,908 --> 00:46:59,185
- I just felt so weird.
- That's great, Jacob.

317
00:46:59,269 --> 00:47:03,660
You have no idea what I'm
going through. I needed some company.

318
00:47:03,749 --> 00:47:08,982
I missed her so terribly.
It's so damned sad.

319
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:13,347
Sad? Do you want me
to tell you what's sad?

320
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:17,217
A eight year old girl killed
in the same way as Rebecca.

321
00:47:17,309 --> 00:47:21,825
"Johnny Solheim's dead daughter."
That is sad.

322
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:24,298
Stine?

323
00:47:26,789 --> 00:47:31,021
- Do you know Johnny Solheim?
- Yes, sure - we played together.

324
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:35,227
- Before we got our breakthrough.
- Did Johnny Solheim play in "Camp"?

325
00:47:35,309 --> 00:47:40,623
He was our guitarist for a short while.
But it didn't work out.

326
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:45,465
Ruth Follnes...
Have you heard that name?

327
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,986
No.
Who's that?

328
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,824
Yeah?

329
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:09,301
- Hi, Hamre. Are you sleeping?
- No. Who can sleep now?

330
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:13,429
Johnny Solheim was a guitarist in Camp.

331
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,423
Two out of three victims
can be connected to the band.

332
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:20,629
The real targets here are not
the victims, but their relatives.

333
00:48:20,711 --> 00:48:24,021
The only thing Stine has
made herself guilty of, is being born.

334
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:27,945
She was killed
in order to get to Johnny.

335
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:30,545
What about Simon and Anita?
Where is the connection there?

336
00:48:30,631 --> 00:48:33,225
I don't know,
but there's has to be something.

337
00:48:33,311 --> 00:48:36,462
The next victim will be someone
close to Harry or Arild.

338
00:48:36,551 --> 00:48:41,864
Okay. We will organize protection.
All men will be armed.

339
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:44,940
Hello.
Are you quite sure this is safe?

340
00:49:45,028 --> 00:49:48,862
Trude has said she would rather
stay home with the girls.

341
00:49:48,948 --> 00:49:52,577
The point here is to continue
to live as normal as possible.

342
00:49:52,668 --> 00:49:54,977
You have to trust the boys.

343
00:49:55,068 --> 00:49:57,900
- Do you know anything more?
- I'm afraid we don't.

344
00:49:57,987 --> 00:50:03,744
- Hi, Harry. How are things?
- I don't know. This is just crazy.

345
00:50:03,827 --> 00:50:07,058
It is, isn't it?

346
00:50:08,987 --> 00:50:13,105
- Have you spoken to all the others?
- No, not Johnny Solheim.

347
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:18,466
The doctor gave him something
to sleep on. He was in shock.

348
00:50:18,547 --> 00:50:23,223
- None of them knew Simon and Anita.
- And what do Simon and Anita say?

349
00:50:23,307 --> 00:50:26,616
- They had hardly ever heard of...
- Camp?

350
00:50:26,706 --> 00:50:30,745
- Hamre, everyone has heard of Camp.
- No, Veum. Not everyone.

351
00:50:30,826 --> 00:50:32,259
Yes?

352
00:50:32,346 --> 00:50:35,179
Then Harry's parents at Kolbotn
are taken care of.

353
00:50:35,266 --> 00:50:37,063
What about Arild?

354
00:50:37,146 --> 00:50:40,024
The mother's dead,
no sisters or brothers.

355
00:50:40,106 --> 00:50:43,018
The father's in Brazil,
he has been informed.

356
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:47,577
- Otherwise he seems very single.
- Everybody has someone.

357
00:50:56,226 --> 00:50:59,023
Hey there, Varg!

358
00:51:00,745 --> 00:51:04,021
You just disappeared
last time I saw you.

359
00:51:04,105 --> 00:51:07,575
You got an SMS
that seemed to make you happy?

360
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:11,544
Is there something
you haven't told me, Arild?

361
00:51:11,625 --> 00:51:16,062
Is she married? Underage?
Is it a guy?

362
00:51:16,145 --> 00:51:22,493
Are you willing to risk her life
just because of some silly secret?

363
00:51:24,745 --> 00:51:31,855
Her family is super-religious. She's
shit scared of what they might do if...

364
00:51:34,744 --> 00:51:40,296
If they find out she's seeing me,
they marry her off to some old sod.

365
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:45,742
In the best of scenarios, see?
Nobody knows about us, Varg.

366
00:51:45,824 --> 00:51:50,534
Have you seen her lately?
Then he knows about you.

367
00:51:50,624 --> 00:51:53,821
What's her name?

368
00:51:55,504 --> 00:52:01,100
- Varg, I can't. I...
- Come on, Arild. What's her name?

369
00:52:02,063 --> 00:52:04,782
- Noor.
- And where is she now?

370
00:52:04,863 --> 00:52:09,220
She teaches adults at Fana
secondary school. Evening classes.

371
00:52:09,303 --> 00:52:13,854
Call her.
Call her, I'm going there now, okay?

372
00:52:23,703 --> 00:52:26,820
- Bye, see you!
- See you later!

373
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:37,417
- Hi, Arild!
- I've been trying to reach you.

374
00:52:37,502 --> 00:52:41,177
- I had my mobile on silent.
- Everything's okay?

375
00:52:41,262 --> 00:52:44,618
- Yes, shouldn't it be?
- Do you have people around you?

376
00:52:44,702 --> 00:52:48,934
I think most of the others have left.
What's going on, you sound so funny?

377
00:52:49,022 --> 00:52:57,339
The police think that the guy who
killed Rebecca might come after you.

378
00:52:57,422 --> 00:53:01,539
They think that he hits the wives
and girlfriends of us in the band.

379
00:53:01,621 --> 00:53:06,058
- But you haven't told anyone about us?
- Come to my place right away.

380
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:12,455
- Then we can talk about it. Love you.
- Love you too.

381
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:45,689
Hello?

382
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:59,330
Noor?

383
00:54:05,779 --> 00:54:08,816
Anyone here?

384
00:54:21,179 --> 00:54:23,374
Noor!

385
00:54:25,139 --> 00:54:27,255
Noor!

386
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:43,529
Arild, call her!
Just do it, quick!

387
00:55:34,576 --> 00:55:37,215
Come on then!

388
00:56:46,614 --> 00:56:50,004
Come on, out of the way.

389
00:56:51,654 --> 00:56:54,964
- Is he armed?
- I don't know.

390
00:56:56,014 --> 00:56:59,848
Armed patrol,
we're unblocking the door.

391
00:56:59,934 --> 00:57:04,449
Confirm that message is received
and understood.

392
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:10,447
I repeat, we're unblocking the door.

393
00:57:10,533 --> 00:57:15,049
Confirm that message is received
and understood.

394
00:57:34,412 --> 00:57:36,721
What are you doing here?

395
00:57:36,812 --> 00:57:40,851
I heard on the wire that you
had caught him.

396
00:57:40,932 --> 00:57:47,121
Blocking removed.
Come out with your arms over your head.

397
00:57:47,212 --> 00:57:52,127
I repeat: Come out
with your arms over your head.

398
00:57:52,212 --> 00:57:57,366
- Hey! Put that gun down!
- Simon, put the gun down.

399
00:58:02,452 --> 00:58:08,401
I'm counting to three.
One - Simon! Two...

400
00:58:08,491 --> 00:58:12,200
Your arms over your head! Okay! Easy.

401
00:58:28,811 --> 00:58:32,281
Who are you? Who are you?

402
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:52,248
She's dumb.
She works here as a cleaner.

403
00:58:58,690 --> 00:59:03,605
- We've searched through the building.
- Do it one more time.

404
00:59:07,809 --> 00:59:13,441
- At least that removes all doubt.
- Yeah, it's the band he's after.

405
00:59:13,529 --> 00:59:16,043
And he wants an audience.

406
00:59:16,129 --> 00:59:21,522
It must be something he wants to take
revenge for. Something they have done.

407
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:26,998
What is it you haven't told us?
Eh, Simon?

408
00:59:27,089 --> 00:59:30,604
- Are you talking to me?
- Yes, I'm talking to you.

409
00:59:30,689 --> 00:59:33,647
He's killing in order to punish you,
isn't he?

410
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:39,917
- What have you done to deserve this?
- What do you mean?

411
00:59:40,008 --> 00:59:45,366
Why do you rather let people
get killed instead of talking about it?

412
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:49,043
Veum, now you're going too far.

413
01:00:08,047 --> 01:00:13,485
- Susanne and Elisabeth, bedtime!
- Is daddy getting a hug?

414
01:00:19,287 --> 01:00:23,678
I've spoken to the police for hours.
I've told them everything I know.

415
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:29,876
He's hit all the others, Harry.
Next in line is Trude, or the girls.

416
01:00:32,447 --> 01:00:37,043
- We have 24 hours protection.
- For the rest of your life?

417
01:00:37,126 --> 01:00:42,723
- No.
- He will make it sooner or later.

418
01:00:42,806 --> 01:00:48,278
Are you protecting anyone?
Or are you afraid of someone?

419
01:00:48,366 --> 01:00:52,757
- Is there money involved?
- We didn't make any money back then.

420
01:00:52,846 --> 01:00:55,121
When, Harry?

421
01:00:56,966 --> 01:01:02,438
Before you made it big?
Before Johnny left?

422
01:01:02,526 --> 01:01:06,121
Just tell me what happened.

423
01:01:09,205 --> 01:01:14,359
Why don't you rather talk to
Jacob about this. You're pals.

424
01:01:14,445 --> 01:01:18,563
You know how he...
manipulates people around him.

425
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:23,560
Does he manipulate you?
No, or I don't know.

426
01:01:23,645 --> 01:01:29,197
- But... I didn't want to...
- What was it you didn't want?

427
01:01:30,805 --> 01:01:34,161
- What is it?
- Nothing.

428
01:01:53,484 --> 01:01:57,602
Jacob Asen's here. He wants
his wife's wedding ring returned.

429
01:02:08,004 --> 01:02:11,279
TRACES OF SEMEN,
INTERCOURSE BEFORE DEATH

430
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:30,482
You said she hadn't been the victim
of a sexual assault.

431
01:02:30,563 --> 01:02:34,078
Well, and she hadn't.

432
01:02:34,163 --> 01:02:37,394
So what does this mean then?

433
01:03:14,321 --> 01:03:17,996
I was forced to have you suspended,
Simon.

434
01:03:18,081 --> 01:03:22,836
I had no choice,
I hope you understand that?

435
01:03:22,921 --> 01:03:26,596
What were you thinking of in there?

436
01:03:26,681 --> 01:03:30,720
I didn't think, I just snapped.

437
01:03:30,801 --> 01:03:34,237
You have of course been
under a terrible strain.

438
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:37,677
We will take that into account.

439
01:04:28,439 --> 01:04:30,430
Sorry.

440
01:05:50,036 --> 01:05:53,824
Before you made it big something
happened that may explain the murders.

441
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:57,670
Harry asked me to talk to you about it.

442
01:05:57,756 --> 01:06:03,149
Jacob?
What is it that you're so afraid of?

443
01:06:03,236 --> 01:06:06,114
I've written a speech
in Rebecca's honour.

444
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:10,109
I wanted to for once give her
all the credit she deserves.

445
01:06:10,196 --> 01:06:17,624
I want to thank her for being patient
with me, but I just don't manage.

446
01:06:17,715 --> 01:06:24,632
Say what a wise, funny, whimsical,
fantastic person she was.

447
01:06:24,715 --> 01:06:30,187
They're all sitting out there.
Her mother, the whole family.

448
01:06:30,275 --> 01:06:36,510
This is what they need to hear. Not
that you fucked her before she died.

449
01:06:38,475 --> 01:06:40,830
You didn't have the guts
to make her yours when you could.

450
01:06:40,915 --> 01:06:45,192
But going behind my back
is of course different.

451
01:06:45,274 --> 01:06:48,710
For how long?
For how long, I said.

452
01:07:09,274 --> 01:07:10,912
Yeah?

453
01:07:14,433 --> 01:07:17,072
Do you know when he will wake up?

454
01:07:17,153 --> 01:07:21,863
At the earliest in a couple of hours.
Perhaps not before tomorrow.

455
01:07:48,672 --> 01:07:53,143
- Have you prepared food?
- Yes.

456
01:08:34,391 --> 01:08:38,430
Do you want some bread? Salad?

457
01:08:38,511 --> 01:08:42,663
She would have become just like you.

458
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:48,306
Yes.

459
01:09:00,430 --> 01:09:04,901
Anita, there's something
I have to tell you.

460
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:11,265
- I have done things.
- Simon!

461
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:16,864
I know how much you loved her.

462
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:25,585
But now we have to move on,
you understand that?

463
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:32,584
You're all I've got. Simon.

464
01:09:34,549 --> 01:09:37,621
You know that?

465
01:09:39,749 --> 01:09:42,468
Yes, I know.

466
01:09:56,588 --> 01:10:00,217
It's been three years, Simon!

467
01:10:06,108 --> 01:10:09,305
It's been three years.

468
01:10:28,387 --> 01:10:30,503
Do we have anything at all?

469
01:10:30,587 --> 01:10:34,705
It happened in an area out of the
range of the surveillance cameras.

470
01:10:34,787 --> 01:10:37,426
- So he knew the place?
- Or was just lucky?

471
01:10:37,507 --> 01:10:40,340
No,
this killer is not counting on luck.

472
01:10:40,427 --> 01:10:45,421
This whole thing was executed
according to a detailed plan.

473
01:10:46,227 --> 01:10:48,342
Hi!

474
01:11:24,345 --> 01:11:29,897
We're sitting here with the
whole picture, but we don't see a shit!

475
01:11:44,505 --> 01:11:46,621
Hi.

476
01:12:00,464 --> 01:12:03,422
- Hi.
- Hi.

477
01:12:03,504 --> 01:12:07,577
Is it you guys that are getting a lift
with a patrol car?

478
01:12:07,664 --> 01:12:11,657
- The car is right over there.
- Okay.

479
01:12:46,623 --> 01:12:49,694
THE BEGINNING

480
01:13:30,061 --> 01:13:31,540
Isachsen? It's me, Veum.

481
01:13:31,621 --> 01:13:35,899
I can't talk to you right now,
he's taken the twins!

482
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:59,052
- Shall we go?
- This is totally insane.

483
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:01,938
- Do you have a better idea, Harry?
- We must go to the police!

484
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:05,410
What do you think Trude will say then?

485
01:14:05,500 --> 01:14:10,449
He kills Stine and gets a couple
of years in jail? No fucking way!

486
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:15,330
- Are you only after revenge?
- If I want revenge?

487
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:20,778
A man sneaks into my house
and kills my eight year old daughter.

488
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:24,772
You can bet your
ass that I want revenge.

489
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:29,091
What do think will happen when he gets
out? Has he forgotten you, you think?

490
01:14:29,179 --> 01:14:32,216
And your twins?

491
01:14:35,699 --> 01:14:39,009
He must be stopped.

492
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:43,455
I've already spoken to the police.

493
01:14:43,539 --> 01:14:46,975
In the interrogation report it says
that it was you who found her.

494
01:14:47,059 --> 01:14:51,371
It seems you were able
to think pretty clearly.

495
01:14:51,459 --> 01:14:56,248
Do you know anything about knots?

496
01:14:56,338 --> 01:14:58,772
No.

497
01:14:58,858 --> 01:15:05,730
No. Because then you would have seen
that this one here is totally wrong.

498
01:15:05,818 --> 01:15:09,413
All the other nooses
were professionally made.

499
01:15:09,498 --> 01:15:15,050
But this here was made by someone
who has no idea how they are made.

500
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:21,448
The day you found her...

501
01:15:24,537 --> 01:15:28,655
She wasn't getting any better, was she?

502
01:15:30,377 --> 01:15:37,249
She wasn't taking her medicine because
she believed the pills made her fat.

503
01:15:37,337 --> 01:15:41,774
Then one day she couldn't
take it any more.

504
01:15:42,457 --> 01:15:48,453
She came back here.
Took some pills, and killed herself.

505
01:15:50,497 --> 01:15:57,766
Simon blames the band for something.
What had they done to her? Anita?

506
01:15:57,856 --> 01:16:01,531
What had they done to her?

507
01:16:26,055 --> 01:16:30,685
She worshiped him.
The lead singer.

508
01:16:31,335 --> 01:16:35,214
Simon didn't allow her to go
to their concerts. He was afraid.

509
01:16:35,295 --> 01:16:39,652
He works with these things
and he knew what might happen.

510
01:16:39,735 --> 01:16:43,171
What happened?

511
01:16:52,175 --> 01:16:55,849
I was sitting here
in the kitchen all night, waiting.

512
01:16:55,934 --> 01:16:59,722
While Simon drove around
looking for her.

513
01:16:59,814 --> 01:17:03,648
At five in the morning
he finally found her.

514
01:17:03,734 --> 01:17:09,570
In a bus shed.
She was completely lethargic.

515
01:17:09,654 --> 01:17:15,012
Didn't say a word.
Didn't reply to our questions.

516
01:17:15,094 --> 01:17:20,885
When she came home she just
went straight upstairs and went to bed.

517
01:17:25,213 --> 01:17:29,047
In the end I managed to make her talk.

518
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:39,045
She had stayed behind after
the concert, with the guys in the band.

519
01:17:41,253 --> 01:17:47,442
They had given her some pills,
and then they...

520
01:17:52,453 --> 01:17:54,523
They...

521
01:18:00,292 --> 01:18:03,807
All four of them.

522
01:18:09,052 --> 01:18:11,930
Grown men.

523
01:18:13,132 --> 01:18:16,283
She wasn't even fifteen.

524
01:18:21,492 --> 01:18:26,849
I promised her one thing.
Not to say anything to her father.

525
01:18:26,931 --> 01:18:30,719
Not say anything to daddy.

526
01:18:33,691 --> 01:18:37,400
There has to be something
else we can do?

527
01:18:37,491 --> 01:18:42,849
Jacob, you can't seriously mean
that you want to do this?

528
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:07,005
It's all my fault!

529
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:11,208
If only I hadn't said anything,
then perhaps...

530
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:13,360
Anita, Anita...

531
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:17,966
There are two children out there,
two young children.

532
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:22,521
I don't know anything.
I can't help you.

533
01:19:31,329 --> 01:19:36,767
Hello, you've reached Jan Isachsen at
Bergen Police Department. I cannot...

534
01:20:44,687 --> 01:20:47,645
Open the door and get in.

535
01:20:57,287 --> 01:20:59,481
It's just too bad, isn't it, Simon.

536
01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:05,436
You did everything you could to protect
your daughter and yet it went wrong.

537
01:21:08,206 --> 01:21:13,519
It's not too late to turn back.
Hamre is still alive.

538
01:21:26,246 --> 01:21:29,635
What happened?

539
01:21:29,725 --> 01:21:33,684
What on earth happened, Simon?

540
01:21:36,245 --> 01:21:42,514
Your daughter killed herself
because you weren't there for her.

541
01:21:44,285 --> 01:21:48,676
Four grown men, one after the other.

542
01:21:50,525 --> 01:21:53,722
That's what killed her.

543
01:22:05,124 --> 01:22:07,240
Hey!

544
01:22:07,324 --> 01:22:13,115
Give it here!
You heard me, give it here!

545
01:22:17,044 --> 01:22:22,641
Throw it here! Do you hear me!
Throw it here! Here!

546
01:22:25,604 --> 01:22:28,437
Get out of the car!
Now!

547
01:22:28,524 --> 01:22:32,357
He's got Varg.

548
01:22:37,603 --> 01:22:39,958
You prick!

549
01:22:40,043 --> 01:22:43,797
What do we do with Varg?

550
01:22:52,403 --> 01:22:56,555
We have no choice.
We've got to take him too.

551
01:23:06,962 --> 01:23:12,036
What are you playing at?
Jacob? Look at me.

552
01:23:14,722 --> 01:23:17,953
Are you going to kill me?

553
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:39,679
How will you kill me then, Jacob?

554
01:23:39,761 --> 01:23:43,390
Make me get down on my knees and give
me a shot in the back of my head?

555
01:23:43,481 --> 01:23:47,713
And how will you get rid of the bodies?
You could bury us.

556
01:23:47,801 --> 01:23:51,555
But there will always be a dog coming
along and dig out the whole shit again.

557
01:23:51,641 --> 01:23:56,271
- You could dump me in the sea, but...
- I didn't ask for this.

558
01:23:56,361 --> 01:24:00,115
Some little girl four years ago.
How can you avoid it?

559
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:03,715
Stop raping fourteen-year-olds!

560
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:07,558
It wasn't rape!

561
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:12,475
Besides, how could we know
she was fourteen?

562
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:17,596
She was totally up for it.

563
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,959
What do you think will happen
if this gets out?

564
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:32,353
I haven't deserved that.
I haven't deserved any of this.

565
01:24:43,159 --> 01:24:45,627
What happens now?

566
01:24:45,719 --> 01:24:52,352
You regret so intensely what you've
done that you'll blow your brains out.

567
01:25:05,638 --> 01:25:09,517
So what shall we do with Varg then?

568
01:25:12,438 --> 01:25:17,466
- No, Jacob, you can't...
- Everybody will believe he did it.

569
01:25:17,558 --> 01:25:21,073
- Have you gone totally insane!
- Can you shut the fuck up!

570
01:25:21,758 --> 01:25:24,272
Jacob...

571
01:26:04,756 --> 01:26:07,224
You do it.

572
01:26:13,116 --> 01:26:16,745
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

573
01:26:16,836 --> 01:26:20,192
Especially not if you want to
see your daughters again.

574
01:26:20,276 --> 01:26:23,473
- Don't listen to him.
- How's that?

575
01:26:23,556 --> 01:26:28,425
Have you checked your mobile lately?
Go on, check your mobile!

576
01:26:40,675 --> 01:26:43,826
He's got the girls!

577
01:26:49,155 --> 01:26:52,511
Where are they then?
They're alive.

578
01:26:52,595 --> 01:26:56,588
But not for much longer
if you shoot me.

579
01:26:57,795 --> 01:27:02,585
If he had them he would've
already killed them long ago.

580
01:27:02,675 --> 01:27:05,984
I forgot the dresses.

581
01:27:09,634 --> 01:27:14,662
Tell me where they are! Tell me! Now!

582
01:27:14,754 --> 01:27:19,384
Otherwise you will shoot me?
Or what!

583
01:27:19,474 --> 01:27:22,227
Tell me where they are!

584
01:27:22,314 --> 01:27:25,192
Harry!
Harry, I shall find your daughters.

585
01:27:25,274 --> 01:27:29,631
The next will hit your thigh,
so tell me where they are!

586
01:27:30,554 --> 01:27:36,662
All right, all right. Come here, and
I'll tell you. I'll whisper it to you.

587
01:27:36,753 --> 01:27:38,903
- Don't listen to him.
- Shut up, will you!

588
01:27:38,993 --> 01:27:41,461
Come here.

589
01:27:55,473 --> 01:27:59,466
- What?
- What's he saying?

590
01:27:59,553 --> 01:28:06,105
You can do whatever you want with me,
it's the only way.

591
01:28:08,992 --> 01:28:11,426
Harry.

592
01:28:20,112 --> 01:28:21,909
Harry?

593
01:28:26,272 --> 01:28:31,062
- What are you doing?
- Ruth was deeply in love with you.

594
01:28:31,152 --> 01:28:36,020
I said we should go to the police,
but you wouldn't listen.

595
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:41,185
- Why do you never listen to me?
- Harry, drop it.

596
01:28:42,671 --> 01:28:46,949
- Harry! I know where your girls are.
- Tell me then.

597
01:28:47,031 --> 01:28:49,625
I'm the only one
who knows where they are.

598
01:28:49,711 --> 01:28:54,626
- There's only one place they can be.
- So tell me then!

599
01:28:54,711 --> 01:29:00,263
- Call the police, then I'll tell you.
- Do as I say, or they will die.

600
01:29:00,351 --> 01:29:03,502
Who do you trust here, Harry?
Him or me?

601
01:29:03,591 --> 01:29:07,822
- Shoot Jacob!
- Him or me?

602
01:29:07,910 --> 01:29:12,700
- Shoot Jacob. Shoot Jacob!
- Harry! Don't do it!

603
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:23,463
I shall find your girls.

604
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:33,384
- So where are they?
- I don't know. I was bluffing.

605
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:36,780
- What?!
- I had to.

606
01:29:36,870 --> 01:29:39,258
It must be possible somehow
to reconstruct the route he followed.

607
01:29:39,349 --> 01:29:41,943
From toll road receipts or something.

608
01:29:42,029 --> 01:29:46,386
We're talking about two young girls.
He can't have taken them just anywhere.

609
01:29:46,469 --> 01:29:52,101
There was something about his reaction.
He actually believed that I knew.

610
01:29:52,189 --> 01:29:57,263
- Why did he believe that?
- Because it was so obvious?
