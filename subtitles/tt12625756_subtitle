1
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,320
Do you know who Perumadan is, Shajiva?

2
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,360
He is a phantom who leads everyone astray.

3
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,080
One day, a Monk decided to capture him.

4
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,600
The Monk ventured into the forest

5
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,280
With a basket on his head
to carry the trapped Perumadan.

6
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
A beautiful forest...

7
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,680
Full of mysterious creatures...

8
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,200
The Monk did not know his way.

9
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,720
But the trees, animals, birds and plants...

10
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,280
winked at each other...

11
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,240
They knew him.

12
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,920
The Monk had walked for long
when he found a ball on the ground

13
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,080
He picked it up and put it in his basket

14
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,200
A gift for his children.

15
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,360
Hours later,
there was a sudden movement in the basket

16
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,040
An anteater, rolled up like a ball,
spoke from inside...

17
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,520
O’Lord, slow down.

18
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,600
The Monk was amused.

19
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,560
He slowed down.

20
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,720
Then the anteater said:
Good Sir, head this way!

21
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,800
The Monk obeyed.

22
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,760
So the anteater said:
Dear Lord, take that way!

23
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,200
And he did.

24
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,240
They say the Monk is
still wandering in the forest...

25
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,760
He hasn't yet realised...

26
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,120
It’s the phantom who is
sitting atop his head!

27
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,920
CHURULI

28
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,000
What’s my name from here on?

29
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,200
Antony

30
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,280
- And yours?

31
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,480
- Sajivan

32
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,200
- No. Sha-jivan.

33
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,360
- Okay

34
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,920
The name packs a punch!
Shaji is the official name of scoundrels.

35
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,960
We must go all out to pass off as lowlives!

36
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,560
From today I’m not an ASI (Asst. Sub Inspector)
and you’re not a PC (Police Constable)

37
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,280
We’re just daily wagers.

38
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,520
But don’t think you can act smart
after we catch him!

39
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,600
You better salute me
whenever we cross paths!

40
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,960
Yeah.

41
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,360
Sir, how far is Bhadravati crossing from here?

42
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,800
Sir, you speak the local language?

43
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,600
- Who is a policeman from the Crime Squad?
- Um...

44
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,160
Never mind. What do policemen do?

45
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,640
Police duty...

46
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,560
Who really catches all the criminals?
Officers like us who roam around in mufti.

47
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,800
Not the ones at the station
wearing uniforms and blowing whistles!

48
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,400
They are just chowkidars (guards)!

49
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,800
Cold... I’m cold...

50
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,480
What’s special about you?
Nothing.

51
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,320
Once you mingle with common folk,
you become one of them. Got me?

52
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Mmm

53
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,600
Officers with striking looks...

54
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,360
Like Chettiar...

55
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,720
He could never do what we do!

56
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,200
What about you, Sir?

57
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,760
Don’t call me Sir!
Stick to Antony Chettan!

58
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,320
I’m not saying they recruited you
because you look common.

59
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,040
One needs to be capable.
And have respect for the law.

60
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,280
Sir, I always buy my ticket the minute I board.
I don’t pull the PC card...

61
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,160
That’s how you should be!

62
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,280
The Late Basheer sir used to say:

63
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,080
Secret Police must be like
mongrels at a fish market.

64
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:22,600
No one must notice us,
but we must notice everything.

65
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,160
Hello? Yeah.

66
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,440
Have you eaten?

67
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,080
Everything’s okay.

68
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,920
I’m on the bus.
I’ll call once I’m off.

69
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,240
Poor signal...

70
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,120
Okay.

71
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
-Let’s go to that shop.
-But people say...

72
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,480
only losers and good-for-nothings
are employed by the Crime Squad.

73
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,200
That’s like blaming your wife for your handicap!

74
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,760
- Right...

75
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,560
-They didn’t want to relieve me
from the Batheri Station.

76
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,320
-Really?

77
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,200
-SP sir said... “You’ve solved so many cases in uniform
how many more will you solve without it?”

78
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,160
Oh...

79
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,400
Basheer Sir would capture five kilos
of gold and only record three.

80
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,160
- What, really? !
- Yeah.

81
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,400
Come, let’s eat.

82
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,320
Slow down, dude.
The Chief said we can take our time.

83
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
Sir, if we catch him soon
we can go back quickly...

84
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,320
Don’t dream of home and
cuddling your wife when you set out for work!

85
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,440
Don’t worry. Capable policemen never
go long without action.

86
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,040
That must be why you’re not married.

87
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,400
- How much?
- 45

88
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,320
- How do we get to Churuli?
- Go up that way, there's a jeep.

89
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,480
- Shall I pack a bottle of honey?
- Nah, I’m diabetic!

90
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,920
Hey Sasi, look at this!
Two Americans were taken by aliens in their vehicle!

91
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,800
How far?

92
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,960
Churuli?

93
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
We are trying to catch a man
who is like a dog from hell.

94
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,720
-So don’t say anything stupid, alright?
- Mmm.

95
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,680
He probably caught wind of us
the minute we left home. He’s wily!

96
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,760
But if he is a dog,
our Chief’s a tiger, sir!

97
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,680
I mean, Antony Chetta!

98
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,600
Many have been on his trail...
Capture him and show them, Shajiva!

99
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,480
And stand up to those who mocked you
for being a squad recruit!

100
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,480
Yeah!

101
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,560
Oh no...

102
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,120
No one’s around...

103
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,680
-Shajiva?
-Yeah?

104
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,080
This looks like a ride to hell!

105
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,000
Oi!

106
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:54,640
Ah!

107
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,080
Come here, son!
Is this the jeep to Churuli?

108
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,520
A few more people are coming.
We’ll leave soon.

109
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,920
-Whom are you going to meet?
-Err... To dig pits in a rubber plot...

110
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,160
Belonging to... a Jose or Joy...?

111
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,960
- It might be Thankan Chettan.
- Right!

112
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,320
He had leased out his old trees.
Maybe he wants to plant new ones.

113
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,320
Oh, that must be it, Shaji.

114
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,200
But Thankan chettan has gone home...
Where are you from?

115
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,920
- Oh, he’s not around?
- No.

116
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,960
We are from Koorachundu, Kuttyadi.
What do we do now, Shajiva?

117
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,440
You’ve come all this way anyway.
He should be back in a few days.

118
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,400
What do we do till then?

119
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,560
It's only a few days.
You can find a place to stay.

120
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,760
-Where... and money?
-But we don’t know anyone there.

121
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,440
So what, brothers? Just hop in!
We’ll make a fun trip of it!

122
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,600
Alright, let’s go...

123
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,400
Good folks!
Humble and polite...

124
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,000
They have come far to farm
and make an honest living...

125
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,600
That scoundrel must have
tricked them and settled here.

126
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,800
He alway gives us the slip!

127
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,040
Basheer sir caught him once.

128
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,280
He still managed to escape.

129
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,640
Humbug! The trouble is,
we have no means to identify him.

130
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:27,920
There’s no record of him
even in the voters' list or ration card!

131
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,280
- Don’t you have any vices?
-Nah!

132
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,880
- Not even alcohol?
- No...

133
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,080
Come, let's go!

134
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,240
They are ready.

135
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,040
- Coming!
- Hop in from here!

136
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,520
Sit closer.

137
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,560
Let's go?

138
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,920
- Whoa! This is a badass engine!
-Yeah

139
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
Wow! Such fertile soil!

140
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,520
It must be very easy to farm here...
especially yams!

141
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,120
How's the rainfall here?

142
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,440
If you get mid-season rains,
you can grow plantains, too.

143
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,040
All said and done, only our people...

144
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,800
can come all this way,
clear the forest and farm! Right?

145
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,400
If the Brits hadn't come,
all this would have remained a jungle, right?

146
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,800
- You guys don't talk much, do you?
- Yeah, I felt so too

147
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,640
-Look!

148
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,800
-It's a local temple.
- Oh...

149
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,960
Speed up, my boy!

150
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:23,560
Right?

151
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,240
Shift the gear and let her zip, son!

152
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,320
I used to drive a timber truck
through the Wayanad pass.

153
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,400
This is nothing new!

154
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,040
Oh, wow!
He’s in great form now!

155
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,120
Good going, man!

156
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,200
Whoa!

157
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,640
Lucky there's no glass!
Or I would’ve smashed my skull!

158
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,240
- Cross the bridge and wait.
- Okay.

159
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,280
- Antony chetta, I'm coming!
- Just come!

160
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,320
Come, dude!

161
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,120
Take my hand.

162
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,600
Careful...

163
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,800
The bridge is weak.

164
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,480
Even we can't walk on this...
How will the jeep cross it?

165
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,360
Careful, son!

166
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,960
- Yes! Come on!

167
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,560
Move forward!

168
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,760
Slightly to the left!

169
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,360
Just come!

170
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,400
Stop, stop!

171
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,120
Oh Lord!

172
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,720
It's all slippery!

173
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,040
Now come.

174
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,120
Turn to the right a bit...

175
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,240
Yes! To the right!

176
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,080
Come on!

177
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,000
Come on!

178
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,280
Yes, keep moving!

179
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:51,960
That's it!

180
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,680
Done!

181
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,120
Shajiva, come on!

182
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,160
Whoa! You could drive
over a hair strand, man!

183
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,000
It's a wonder you’re still here!

184
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,880
Why the hell are you piling on?!
Get off, you asshole!

185
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,520
You think they are all standing around for nothing?

186
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,880
His frickin’ bag!

187
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,560
Come

188
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,560
Wait, wait!

189
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,280
Get in, you motherfuckers!

190
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,080
- What the hell are you staring at?
- Yes, yes, we're coming!

191
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,040
Get in you...!!

192
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,160
Brushing against me!
Move, you cretin!

193
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,400
Seems like a different place shajiva.

194
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,040
Did you fuck a buffalo
on the way, you scumbag?

195
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,440
Not a buffalo!
I fucked your mother!

196
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,400
Get the fuckoff you...!

197
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,000
Move!
(drunk mumbling)

198
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,920
Hey!
Fetch me something to eat, you scumbag!

199
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,960
If you’re so hungry, bring your wife's thing you scumbag!

200
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,040
I’ve brought you two fat eels!

201
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:53,560
♫ Fish... these angel fish
swam free not long ago ♫

202
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,520
-What are you gawking at?
- Never mind.

203
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:00,040
-Shall I serve tapioca and fish curry?
-Hold on. Give them some drinks first.

204
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,320
- Sister! Two bottles here!
- Let me give the thirsty ones some drinks!

205
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,800
Can you get us some fish curry
to go with it?

206
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,120
Shall I serve some finely cooked
monitor lizard? Move it, you dolt!

207
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,280
I’m gonna feast!

208
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,760
Holy cow, Shajiva!

209
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,200
Why did you chug it if you don't drink?!

210
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,720
Don't worry, it’s good stuff.
Only some ammonia to ferment it quick.

211
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,040
What? So you don't get toddy here?

212
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:32,040
Will your dad come
to tap toddy here, you bastard?

213
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,640
Where did you find these fuckers?

214
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,800
They are here to dig pits
in Thankan chettan’s plot.

215
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,480
They didn't know he’s away.

216
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,920
Great. Guess I’ll have to
take care of them now.

217
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,800
A guy showed up last year

218
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,120
I was broke by the time he left.
I won’t mince my words, mind you!

219
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,640
Suck it you scumbag!

220
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,440
-What the heck do you want?
-Some gravy.

221
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,960
And more tapioca!

222
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,120
-Hey
-I'm coming!

223
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,200
-Stir the meat curry.
-I only have two hands!

224
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:09,080
♫ My family is joy, pure joy! ♫

225
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,960
♫ Only in my family do I dance for joy! ♫

226
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
Hand it to me!

227
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,760
Don’t you want anything?

228
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,680
Get out of the kitchen, man!

229
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,440
Half a bottle there!

230
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,240
Just do what you’re told!

231
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,600
-No one stays for free. You must work
or I’ll work you!

232
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,400
Why everyone is so silent?

233
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,400
Sir, shouldn’t we report
our arrival to the Chief?

234
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,280
Is this a government office
to report daily?

235
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,640
Take a swig and enjoy
your first night, you fool!

236
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,800
Bet he’s been waiting since daybreak!
Look at him run.

237
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,000
See?

238
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,080
You’re here!

239
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,000
Pour me some!
Go on! Quick!

240
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,280
I’m sick of this loser.

241
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,560
Open it!

242
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,680
Cup your palms, idiot.

243
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,120
-Yeah, that’s enough!
-Some more!

244
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,720
-I’ll carry it.
-Yeah, bring it up.

245
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,320
♫ Clean by day,
ride him by night ♫

246
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,160
Whoa!

247
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,360
You’ve tidied up like a new bride!

248
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,400
Everything looks spic and span!

249
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,320
You will survive anywhere you go!

250
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,440
You guys didn’t show
and it’s past 11, so...

251
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,280
That’s what the fellows
who came earlier said too...

252
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:19,040
Will you do everything women do?

253
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,040
How’s the curry?
Let me taste.

254
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,520
Wow!

255
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,680
But we can’t serve such tasty food here!
Hand me the chilli.

256
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,080
- Hold it
-That's too much...

257
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,360
Nah, it should burn your insides!

258
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,520
Hey, do you butcher here daily?

259
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:42,880
-Of course!
-Really?

260
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,600
-Head to the forest at night...
-Okay

261
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,960
Your dad and granny slaughter pigs there!

262
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,920
- Stop blabbering, you buffoon!
- Look at that! Wild game!

263
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,520
Are you trying to finish this?
What will we serve?

264
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,720
- Right
- Take it inside!

265
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,800
Brother, how many families
live in this area?

266
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,360
Is he here to take the bloody census?
Damn questions!

267
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,440
Probably thinking of settling here
if there’s enough work. Right?

268
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:15,960
-Yeah
-You can stay if you want, I’ll go!

269
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,000
Hey, where is he? Drank and left?

270
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,040
Yeah. He roamed the forest all night.
Let him rest.

271
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,160
- Are you horny or what?
- I’ll smack you with my axe!

272
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,080
Good god!

273
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,280
Are you the CBI, you moron?
Shut up, alright?!

274
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,880
If he gets so much as a whiff,
we’ll have to chase him across the country!

275
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,960
How will we find him
unless we know who’s around?

276
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,960
-I don’t want to waste time.
-We need to spend time!

277
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,040
If you want to get home early,
you better look for some other job!

278
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,280
Noisy hunters don’t catch a thing!
We must be discreet.

279
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:18,280
I feel like we've been here for ages...

280
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:24,720
Did you bribe your way into the force?
Bloody homesick ninny!

281
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,800
Does it take two to draw a pail of water?!

282
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,240
People will be here soon.
Come fetch the tapioca!

283
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:32,760
You go, I’ll fill this.

284
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,040
Faffing around as always...
No sense of time!

285
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:48,240
Vehicles rarely come this way...
this path was cleared by foot.

286
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,960
How long have you had electricity?

287
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,120
A year and half, I think.

288
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,560
- But you have it at the shop?
- Yeah, but not yet at home.

289
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,000
- Can we draw a line in the forest?
- Why do you care?

290
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,240
Ask sensible questions.
Don't talk rubbish to make conversation!

291
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,680
The forest is thick here.

292
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,280
Oi!
Where you off to?

293
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,200
Kariacha! Off to trick people
early in the morning?

294
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,040
Off to deliver your
mom's bastard, you cretin!

295
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,360
-Such rascals all around!
-And you know everyone?

296
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,520
Oh, that’s because there
are very few people here...

297
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,200
So we horse around!

298
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,040
Isn’t your name Philip?
Why did he call you Karia?

299
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,640
Did you sleep well last night?

300
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:38,160
I fell asleep fine...
but I woke up hearing noises.

301
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,920
We have wild elephants here.

302
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,400
- Elephants come out here?
- Oh yes, they do.

303
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,040
Isn't that dangerous?

304
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,680
Nothing to fear...
They wrecked my house twice.

305
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:52,440
When they destroy, we build again!
That’s all... Got it?

306
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,640
Nothing to fear.

307
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,320
Just swig a couple of stiff drinks
and go to sleep, that’s all.

308
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,000
Not sure what it was...
But when I stepped out...

309
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,080
I saw something like a fire-ball!

310
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,640
Did you hear maybe a siren or
an elephant trumpeting?

311
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,280
- Yes, something like that!
- Hmm... yeah.

312
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,360
It’s the theechamundi (fire spirit)
from the North hill going to the South hill.

313
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,360
It’s the theechamundi (fire spirit)
from the North Hill going to the South Hill.

314
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,040
-Really?!
-There’s an old church built by a foreigner

315
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,200
Dedicated to Mother Mary...

316
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,120
- Oh?
- Yup!

317
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,200
It’s the elder sister
going to visit the younger one.

318
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,320
Nothing else!

319
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,480
The stories people make up!

320
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,280
Shut up, you fool!

321
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:37,480
I’ve seen it clearly!
This close!

322
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,120
What do you know? Come on now!

323
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,200
I told you not to ask stupid questions.

324
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,440
This is Channakkoova.
Elephants eat them.

325
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:53,280
See, this is the elephant trail
They pass through here.

326
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,160
We have to walk further.

327
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,400
Please put it in here.

328
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,520
- Hey, come and hold this!
- Yeah.

329
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,400
Why was he so brusque?

330
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:38,360
He is a tight-ass.
Not even rats can get to his tapioca!

331
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,120
No one else lives there?

332
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
He kicked two wives to death!

333
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,440
He has a daughter,
a real sexy chick!

334
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,600
She’s old enough, but somehow
he hasn’t married her off yet!

335
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,960
Are you interested?

336
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,960
Doesn’t he talk to anyone at the shop?

337
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,240
- Better not talk to him!
- Why?

338
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,440
There was one Vasu here, two years ago.
Two cops came in search of him.

339
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,400
This scoundrel betrayed him.

340
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,440
Do cops come here?
What was the case against him?

341
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,280
You scared of cops?

342
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,080
- You guys here after some gang rape?
- Oh, no!

343
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,120
Don’t worry...
The police won’t come here.

344
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,720
And if they do,
they wont leave in peace...

345
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,280
It will be hard...

346
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,280
This is no ordinary land, my son...

347
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,400
Hey! Don’t you have any work
besides eating and drinking?

348
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,160
Why can't you go to
Thankan's house and check?

349
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,960
His wife must be home.

350
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,480
Get going, you slowpoke!

351
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,720
The plot where you’ll work
is even further away.

352
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Let him get back!

353
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,000
Fixing a deal is men’s work.

354
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,760
Why don't we go there and check?

355
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:05,520
We can start if she gives us the rate per pit.
Why waste time?

356
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,760
Get lost, you stinker!

357
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,760
I'm not coming if there are only women.

358
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,560
Why the hell can’t you go?

359
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,240
Scared she’ll seduce you?

360
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,080
Anyway, I'm going.

361
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,400
Sister, what’s the real name
of the shop owner?

362
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,720
Hey, grandma!

363
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,920
Who are you, boy?
I’ve seen you around before...

364
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,880
I'm from a bit far...

365
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,880
I mean, why are you here?

366
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,120
I came to dig pits
in Thankan chettan’s plot.

367
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,400
Have you finished your job?

368
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,240
He is not here...

369
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,920
Is there anyone from Iritti here?

370
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,560
You’ll dig pits, is it?

371
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,160
You’ll dig pits, eh?

372
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,600
You dare come to Churuli
to dig pits?!

373
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,160
Since when are you
the manager here, you halfwit?

374
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,200
- Who’s senior, you or me?
- You, sir.

375
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,520
You are my subordinate, got it?

376
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,920
- Someone might hear us, sir!
- Nobody’s here!

377
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,240
You bastard!
Why did you go wandering?

378
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,800
- Antony chetta... we...
- Don't chetta me, you loser! Call me sir!

379
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,400
You’ll call me sir
when no one's around, alright?

380
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,320
- What if I get confused and...
- ​I’ll kill you if you mess up, scumbag!

381
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,240
Get up, you idiot!
Go and stand there.

382
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,560
Salute me, let’s see!

383
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,240
Do it!

384
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,720
Now tell me. What did you gather
from your excursion?

385
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:38,040
Sir, everyone has false names here.
All of them have 4-5 names.

386
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,120
There’s no point enquiring about Joy.
It could be any one of them.

387
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:45,320
What did you expect?
That you can just do a roll call

388
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,520
and arrest the criminal?!

389
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:52,120
If you ask me, we should bring
a battalion of policemen with guns!

390
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,520
Stay there and talk!

391
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,560
We must arrest them all!
Because they are all criminals!

392
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:01,440
We’ll be credited for capturing
a truck load of absconding criminals!

393
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:07,280
- My boy, how long have you been in service?
-5 years.

394
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,720
I have 20 years of service,
with 6 in the Crime Squad.

395
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,000
Let me ask you something.

396
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,800
Whom do we policemen
interact with the most?

397
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,720
- Who?
- With criminals.

398
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,480
And who gives us information
about criminals?

399
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,720
Other criminals!

400
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,520
In other words, they are
our bread and butter, dear Shajiva.

401
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,720
So we shouldn’t catch them?

402
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,040
No, my boy!
The world is full of scumbags.

403
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,560
We catch the scumbags we need,
and others, we choose not to see!

404
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,800
Take that bloody manager here.

405
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,480
He’s a crook who vanished
after his finance company went bust.

406
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,280
I recognised him.
But we don’t need him. Got it?

407
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,160
So if you got the chance,
you wouldn’t arrest Sukumara Kurup (notorious fugitive)?

408
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,200
Get me some pickle!

409
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:11,440
If I happen to meet Kurup, I’ll say:

410
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,560
Dear Kurup bro, please escape!
What’s the fun if you get caught?

411
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:18,040
Everyone will forget you tomorrow.

412
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:23,360
But if you don’t, these bastards
will remember you for centuries!

413
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,600
Did you hear something?

414
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,760
-Did you get scared?
- ​What the!

415
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Gossiping about criminals, eh?

416
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,040
Are you plotting to kill me?
If so, please tell me in advance!

417
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,040
I forgot to tell you something...
The shop will be closed for two days.

418
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,760
It’s my kid’s First Communion.

419
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,320
You can feast on meat and fish
to your heart’s content!

420
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,280
Motherfucker!

421
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,760
Shajiva...

422
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,960
Yeah...

423
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,760
The toilet is merely a concept.

424
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,280
How come, sir?

425
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,240
- We’re pretending to be coolies, right?
- Yeah

426
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,720
Likewise, just pretend we’re invisible.
That’s all!

427
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,360
(Shajivan laughs)

428
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,520
How will they conduct
the Holy Communion here?

429
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,400
Have you seen a church around here?

430
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:37,920
I was wondering too...

431
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,360
I haven't even seen a cross here,
let alone a church!

432
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,200
- Sir...
- Yeah?

433
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:52,280
We don’t have a single
clue about Joy yet...

434
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,240
- Dude!
- Yeah?

435
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,960
Don’t fret.

436
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,880
This is a case many have tried
and failed to solve...

437
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,040
But I’ll share my experience.

438
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,440
In such cases, you’ll feel
disheartened till the very end...

439
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,640
But at long last, a path will appear

440
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,240
I have a feeling this First Communion
is one such opportunity...

441
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,160
- Hey! Put all that in the sack
- Isn’t that what I’m doing?!

442
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,880
No wonder they call you a sucker!
Squeezing the bottle dry!

443
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,480
My dear fellas, stop faffing
and help clean up this place.

444
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,240
We’ll have guests tomorrow.
The place should be clean, right?

445
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,520
We'll also join.

446
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:39,160
Light some frankincense
and air this place out...

447
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,520
Let’s remove the stench of fish, meat
and vomit from here.

448
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:45,600
The Communion’s tomorrow
and you’re cleaning the shop?

449
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,080
We’ll take care of this.
The shop’s closed for two days, right?

450
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:51,040
- You head to the church.
- Yeah, we’ll handle things here.

451
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,080
-Come here, let me tell you something...
-What is it?

452
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,040
For the next couple of days,
this will be our church!

453
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:57,880
What?

454
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
Look here!

455
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,920
This is the altar!
This is the sanctuary!

456
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,040
Here, people can kneel,
stand, do whatever... No issues!

457
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,080
Come here.
You too!

458
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,480
- Make it fast!
- ​Piss off!

459
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:15,800
This area is for the priest
and his assistant to change.

460
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,360
-What do you think?
- Nice...

461
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,640
Know what this is?
A closet for ...

462
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,400
- Come! See that tree there?
- Yeah?!

463
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,280
If you hang a curtain from it,
that becomes our store room.

464
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,000
We must serve decent food
to at least 75 people.

465
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,680
Is it the toddy shop turned into a church? or the church
turned into a toddy shop?

466
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,720
Anyway there is a holy awakening!

467
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,480
Around 70 people will be arriving right?

468
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,040
Mightbe people from around.

469
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,480
- Hey Kariacha, will everyone
around here come?

470
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,160
Everyone will come, including children.

471
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,920
How about those
not in good terms with you?

472
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:05,880
Peace to all who come here!

473
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,520
Go and get the work done.
Don't faff!

474
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,680
-Where are all the ladles?
-See if there's enough light, you pricks!

475
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:38,400
♫ O’ traveller from Zion,
crossing the seas ♫

476
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,520
♫ Don't fear the waves! ♫

477
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,720
♫ O’ traveller from Zion,
crossing the seas ♫

478
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:53,880
♫ Don't fear the waves! ♫

479
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,320
♫ The one who commands
the seas and winds ♫

480
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:04,360
♫ Is on board with you ♫

481
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:09,520
- A vehicle is here.
- Is that the Priest?

482
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,720
-Yes, it's him.

483
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,520
Father, praise the Lord!

484
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,920
Hope the ride hasn’t tired you, Father.

485
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,280
Father, praise the Lord.

486
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,160
Watch your step, Father.

487
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,680
We’ve arranged everything...

488
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,680
Hey, make way for Father.

489
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:59,160
(Benediction)

490
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:17,720
Body and blood of Christ

491
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,120
-Biju, take the rice!
-Yeah

492
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,040
And take lots of meat curry too.

493
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:28,280
Where’s the vegetable dish, sister?

494
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,040
Good curry, right?

495
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,240
Have some more...

496
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
Are you guys working at the toddyshop?

497
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,000
We came to dig pits for rubber.

498
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,040
Hey, bro!

499
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:47,920
I haven't seen you people around, that's why...

500
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,960
You live near by?
I haven't seen you around, that's why...

501
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,400
Hey Peter, give me some curry.

502
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,400
Get some rice here!

503
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,480
Some vegetable curry, bro.

504
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,360
Pickles, anyone?

505
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:05,240
Give me some more curry!
Just a bit.

506
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:17,000
- How's the food?
- Good!

507
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,320
-And the sides?
-All good!

508
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,240
This is how we all cook.

509
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,760
Is it?

510
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,960
We came to work here...

511
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,360
Do you live in the toddy shop?

512
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:26,680
Yes. Here itself.

513
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,320
Have more curry...

514
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,320
Let me know
if anyone needs anything.

515
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,360
Some more?

516
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,240
Thank you very much, Father.
Praise the Lord!

517
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,120
-Right then, pastor!
-Alright!

518
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,040
-Whew, that's over!

519
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,600
He was about to fall!

520
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,280
Hey, Manicha!

521
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,680
Where’s everyone?

522
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,400
Manicha!

523
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:11,720
Manicha!

524
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,520
It’s under the jackfruit tree.
Stop screaming and take it!

525
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,360
- Where?
- Under the jackfruit tree.

526
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,360
Alright! Come....

527
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,040
- Where did he say it is?
- Under the jackfruit tree.

528
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,400
- That must be it!
- Oh, yeah.

529
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,720
- Shajiva!
- Yeah?

530
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:39,560
- He’s somewhere around here for sure...

531
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:44,600
But we don't know anything besides
his bloody name... Mayiladumparambil Joy!

532
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,720
Then the informer must be
from here too, right?

533
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:53,280
Why can't that rascal just come say: Sir, there’s your Joy!

534
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,120
We could easily arrest him!

535
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:01,320
The informer’s probably laughing
at our cat and mouse game now!

536
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,360
Bloody asshole!

537
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,400
Pour me one here!

538
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,280
I have a wish...
That thug who betrayed Joy...

539
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,760
if he does exist,
I want to meet him!

540
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,720
He’s probably a criminal, too!

541
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,920
Enough! Give it back!

542
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,800
This is the life, my boy!
I'm going to have some fun!

543
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,360
Hey Avaracha! I'm coming along!

544
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,880
-Sure, if you want to!
-You leave. I’ll come in the morning.

545
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:43,760
But don’t complain later that some leech bit you!

546
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,120
- I’ll handle that!
- Sir, one second.

547
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:50,560
What will I do if Thankan comes now?

548
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,280
- ​Put him in your panties, you loser!

549
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,880
I last held a gun as a trainee
20 years ago...

550
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,920
I want to shoot a man!
But haven't even shot a mouse!

551
00:50:56,920 --> 00:51:00,080
- ​Today, I’ll kill a pig!
- Go shoot a pig!

552
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:01,600
What a jerk!

553
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:03,800
Come on! I'll shoot a buffalo today!

554
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:07,120
-Yeah, yeah...
- I am so turned on!

555
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:11,600
- ​Right, a buffalo is waiting for you with its tail up!

556
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,120
- Gimme the gun!
- Hold the sack!

557
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:16,000
- The gun?
- I'll hold it!

558
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,480
Pick it up!

559
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,240
Get lost!

560
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:38,920
Go to hell!

561
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:42,920
Piss off, sleazeballs!

562
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,440
You look like a beanstalk... but you’re not half bad!

563
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,080
- Hey George!
- Yes!

564
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,600
Come here.

565
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,440
Here’s 500 bucks.
Take it.

566
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,320
You worked hard today!
You work a lot.

567
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,480
So keep it!

568
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:06,680
Come here.

569
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,040
Hand me the money.

570
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,800
This is the rent for staying here.

571
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,400
Now you owe me
another 1000 for food and drink.

572
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,000
You can collect that from
Thankan when he gets here.

573
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,800
They haven't returned yet...

574
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,000
Probably stamped to death by some elephant.

575
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:32,440
In a couple of days the women
will come say something stinks.

576
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:38,360
And you can collect his bits in a sack
and let me know, alright?

577
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:39,960
Go sleep!

578
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,920
Then one of the elders asked me

579
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,240
Who are these dressed in white robes ?

580
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,160
Where do they come from?

581
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,000
And I said to him:
My Lord, you know.

582
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,160
And he said to me:
They come from the great tribulation.

583
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,800
They have washed their robes
in the blood of the Lamb,

584
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,640
and made them white.

585
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:15,240
Therefore, they stand before the throne of God
And serve him day and night in his temple.

586
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:51,440
(Music)

587
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:09,400
It's stinking...
Scoundrels bury corpses here!

588
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,400
Hey! It’s noon!
Where are those stinkers?

589
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,440
What about your boss?
Bloody Thankan, where is he?

590
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,760
He should have returned in 4-5 days!

591
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,800
Must have gone behind some whore.

592
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,160
Has he been picked up
by the police or what?

593
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,720
Why would the police catch him?

594
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:36,680
Does anyone who hasn’t screwed up come here, you halfwit?

595
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:41,880
How many times will the two of you
show up to dig the damn pits?!

596
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,960
You jinxed us, you fool!

597
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,040
Twitching like a bird!

598
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,080
Damn.

599
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:28,040
I’ll shove this gun up your ass!

600
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,200
Stop gawking! Just walk!

601
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,480
You son of a bitch!

602
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,720
I lost three days thanks to you, dimwit!

603
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,360
-Don’t dare come here again, you dog!
- But what did I do?

604
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,560
Nothing at all! Why the heck
did you come with me?

605
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,120
Why did you go with him, idiot?

606
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:55,640
What the fuck should I cook instead of meat, you loser?

607
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,320
Kariacha, I...

608
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,920
This loser wanted to hold the gun!

609
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:04,040
Here, take mine! Locked and loaded!

610
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,600
Move! You’ll catch nothing
if you take along duds like him!

611
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:12,240
-I’ll bust your nuts, bastard!
-Go back inside!

612
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,920
Get lost, all of you!
Leery idiots!

613
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,640
Look at his bloody face!
I’ll kick you so hard...

614
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,680
Hey, hey!
That’s enough you dickhead.

615
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,400
To think I’m back in this damn
arrack shop thanks to a mere constable!

616
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,240
On the plus side...

617
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,880
We know he’s not our Joy.

618
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,280
Are you sure?

619
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:54,600
Yeah! He’s from Irikkoor.
Chased off for harassing a neighbour's cow!

620
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,880
Sir, when I went to
the tapioca guy's place...

621
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,320
What is it?
Why did you stop?

622
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:11,600
What if our Chief was wrong?
What if Mayiladankutti Joy is not here?

623
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,080
No, dude...

624
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,240
I’ve been tracking such people
for years now, haven’t I?

625
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,440
He is here...

626
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,040
I can smell him.

627
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,880
- Who are you?
- Came for work.

628
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,120
- At the liquor shop?
- No, to dig pits for rubber.

629
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:13,200
- What's your name?
- Shajivan.

630
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,440
- What?
- Shajivan!

631
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:18,400
Doesn’t have a good ring to it!

632
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,640
He’s from Kodagu.

633
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:44,360
Usually brews his own liquor.
Drops by occasionally...

634
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:48,480
Who are these stinkers?

635
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,400
Workers... here to dig
rubber pits for Thankan.

636
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,560
They look bloody messed up!

637
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,280
He’s not around...
So they are staying here.

638
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,720
They look fishy!

639
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,720
He’s a scumbag.

640
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,200
Reads people at first sight...

641
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,800
-Antony brother
- Yes

642
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:29,680
-Be careful
-It's okay. Walk.

643
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:33,160
-Do you have any idea that howlong we have been here?
- I dont know

644
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,680
Even I dont have any clue.

645
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:40,080
Even we natives, have no clue about it.

646
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,600
Walk fast.
We need to cross the hills

647
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:47,080
(Kannada Extempore)

648
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,800
(Crowd cheers)

649
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,560
Sit closer!

650
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:03,200
Ready, 1,2,3... start!

651
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,280
You go first!
Don't fall.

652
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,560
Slap!

653
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:13,360
(Audience claps)

654
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:25,720
Mystical beings from the sky
go around the Earth

655
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:30,280
-For you at the back!
- Don’t push, you jerk!

656
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,480
When will I get mine?

657
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:34,560
Hey, Kariacha!
Let’s go to the slapping competition!

658
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:36,560
Keep an eye on everything.
I'm going there.

659
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:38,680
Slap him!

660
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,520
Slap him hard, you weakling!

661
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:45,600
Move aside! Kariacha, come!

662
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:48,680
Slap him!

663
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,240
Come on!

664
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:56,640
Come here, you!

665
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,200
-You! Yes, you!
- Me? No way!

666
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,560
-No!
-It will be alright!

667
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,960
You just have to sit there!

668
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,800
I have no idea, please!
Leave me alone! I don't want to!

669
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:12,760
I’ll bet on him! 100 rupees!

670
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:15,640
Slap the hell out of him, man! Slap!

671
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:18,000
This is nothing!
Who do you think my boy is!

672
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,000
Shajiva, make us proud!

673
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:23,640
1,2,3... start!

674
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:26,240
Come on!

675
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:29,000
Slap him!
Smack him to pulp!

676
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,120
Hit him!

677
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,720
Slap him, man!
What the...!

678
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:34,200
Slap him, you stinker!
A tight slap!

679
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,440
Slap him! Slap him hard!

680
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:42,920
Dare mess with us?!

681
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:26,240
Shajiva!

682
01:06:28,520 --> 01:06:29,320
Shajiva?

683
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:35,800
Hey, Shajiva...

684
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:38,920
Hello?

685
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:47,720
Where did he go in the dark?

686
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,440
Hey, Shajiva!

687
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:53,960
- Where’s your husband?
- No idea.

688
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:58,000
He took money from me.
Said he’d get me something from the city.

689
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,240
Must be wandering somewhere!

690
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,120
He just sleeps, drinks
and roams the forest at night!

691
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,800
- Did Annan come here?
- Let him come. I’ll talk to him.

692
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,160
- Ask him.
- Hey, did Annan come here?

693
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,280
He left after two bottles as usual.
Didn't you meet?

694
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:15,160
I went home early.
Haven’t seen him.

695
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,360
We don't know.

696
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:19,960
He might be lying somewhere drunk!
Look around!

697
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,000
Who knows where he went?

698
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:23,520
Go and check.

699
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,600
Man, he seems to be missing!

700
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,520
Looks like it’s risky
to mess with you, eh?

701
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:01,400
Hey!

702
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:03,680
- Where did you go last night?
-Where would I go?

703
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,040
Bastard! Don’t lie!
You weren’t there when I woke up!

704
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,440
Bullshit! You must have dreamt!

705
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,360
I slept like a log!
I woke up only in the morning.

706
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:15,880
Hey!

707
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:38,440
Fuck!

708
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,600
Three’s a crowd, you boneheads!

709
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,400
- Hey, Shajiva!
- What?

710
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:06,800
-Do you know how to shoot?
- We’re not leaving...

711
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,360
until we chuck a sack of
fresh meat at their faces!

712
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:12,000
That’s the dream, man!

713
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,720
When I read reports of
poachers caught by forest guards...

714
01:11:15,720 --> 01:11:17,480
I get such a thrill!

715
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,520
You must hunt wild game and snag a woman
to call yourself a man

716
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:22,640
Will you shut up?

717
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,680
There’s only one rule in the forest...
One person talks, others obey!

718
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:29,120
Keep blabbering and
we’ll catch nothing!

719
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,440
Did you hear that?

720
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,880
It's him!

721
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,440
Who...?

722
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,160
- Him... The Black Monster!
- Oh!

723
01:11:54,160 --> 01:11:58,040
Don't worry, he despises us.

724
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,480
Point the light, dude!

725
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,000
-It must be a leech.
- Oh God! A leech!

726
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,680
- It hurts!
- I asked you to put on repellent!

727
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,760
- Stand still, you fool!
- Gently, please... Gently!

728
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,000
- Light it on fire!
- No, don't!

729
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,480
Shut up!
What did you think bit you?!

730
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:22,720
-There, it's gone!
-Now walk!

731
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:35,520
Shajiva, where are you going?
Have you been here before?

732
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,200
All forests are the same...

733
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:39,680
They lie coiled up...
like a snake.

734
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:41,360
So don’t step on one.

735
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,200
-See, he knows what’s what!
- Right...

736
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,800
Don’t talk. And hold
your breath too. Got it?

737
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:58,320
Come sit here.

738
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:04,440
It's fricking cold!
My legs are cramping...

739
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:16,320
Basheer Sir used to say...
One must hunt wild game and snag a woman

740
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,920
to become a real man!

741
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:18,920
Shhh!

742
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:03,080
Shajiva! It's down!
You shot him down!

743
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,560
Man! I sprained my back!

744
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:11,040
- Hey, Shajiva! Take a look!
- Make way!

745
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,160
Got him!

746
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:22,400
Draw the knife down!
Close to the ribs!

747
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:31,560
- Cut the liver first!
- Piss off, man!

748
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:36,920
-I’ll go home after this, alright?
-Mmm

749
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:40,360
Come back on your
own with the invalid!

750
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,040
Hey Avaracha, we’re coming too!

751
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,040
Please stop! We’re also coming!

752
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:05,200
Hey, come this way!

753
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:15,600
(Groaning)

754
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:38,920
Hey!

755
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,440
Over there!

756
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:43,800
The sound came from there!

757
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:47,360
Up here!

758
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:51,080
There!
Come, let's go there!

759
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,400
It's there!

760
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:57,320
- Wasn’t it over there?
- No, the other way! Come!

761
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:01,360
Hey, where are you stinkers?

762
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:03,760
Come here!

763
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,920
- Where the hell are you?
- Was it over there?

764
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:12,960
Dude! Stop!

765
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,320
I guess the road ends here...

766
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:37,720
Have I gone blind?
Can't see anything!

767
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,880
- How will we get out?
- Shut up! Let's walk back.

768
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:54,080
Hold me!

769
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:57,040
I see a light there!
Let's go!

770
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,280
Man... Will we die here?

771
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,640
Turn the torch on!

772
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:25,800
The battery is dead, dude!

773
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:32,760
Can't see anything...

774
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,760
Look, there's a light!

775
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:42,520
- Come, walk!
- Yeah...

776
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:20,400
HEY!

777
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:33,560
HELLO?

778
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,600
Is anyone around?

779
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,360
Please someone come!

780
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,960
HEY!

781
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:02,760
(Antony whimpering)

782
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:05,520
Oh, Lord! Ow!
(Chanting)

783
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:15,400
(Antony crying)

784
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:27,720
Aren’t we there yet?

785
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:34,520
Come this way.

786
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:44,280
-Bring it down!
-Gently! Please!

787
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,400
- Please! Careful...

788
01:20:49,680 --> 01:20:52,280
- I asked you to shut up!

789
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,240
Go and call her, man.

790
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:55,960
Please ask her to see me!

791
01:20:58,560 --> 01:20:59,400
Sister!

792
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:01,800
Sister...?

793
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:04,080
Who the hell is screaming there?

794
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:05,720
She heard us!

795
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,520
Who is this scumbag?

796
01:21:14,520 --> 01:21:16,200
Can you have a look at his spine?

797
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,440
Please treat me! Please...

798
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,520
Useless vermin!
Good for nothing.

799
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,040
(Antony howling)

800
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:30,160
The spine is sprained.
Needs a good massage.

801
01:21:30,520 --> 01:21:33,360
Or he’ll be nothing more
than a useless vegetable.

802
01:21:35,800 --> 01:21:38,520
-Do you have money?
- I do.

803
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,320
What are you all gawking at?
Get lost, all of you!

804
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:47,000
Let’s go...
She wants them to herself!

805
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:56,960
This isn’t too bad...

806
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:00,000
She let those other guys
off only after 4 days!

807
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:08,160
Omanakutta!

808
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,640
Please come and take a look!

809
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:15,200
Shut up, you cry baby!
Didn't she say she’ll fix it?

810
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,200
-Please ask her to come!
- Sister, could you please take a look?

811
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:19,960
Yeah, coming...

812
01:22:26,720 --> 01:22:27,880
Oh God...

813
01:22:28,920 --> 01:22:31,080
Who are you, boy?
You look very familiar...

814
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,120
I don't know.

815
01:22:34,120 --> 01:22:35,320
You don't know!

816
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:37,760
He’s with me.
We are together.

817
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,240
Oh, you’re together?

818
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:42,320
I don't allow such men here.
Piss off!

819
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:44,600
No, Sister!
He’s not that kinda guy!

820
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:47,640
He came with me for work.
Can you just please take a look?

821
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:50,560
Okay. Remove his clothes,
leave the loin cloth on and get him in.

822
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:52,240
Let me have a look.

823
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,360
Ow! Ow!

824
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,880
A curious place...
Isn’t it, Shajiva?

825
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:35,200
I’ve just applied the oil.
Treatment will take all night.

826
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,280
You can leave at dawn.

827
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,680
Sleep in the other room.

828
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:44,040
There's food in the kitchen.

829
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:47,720
Don't finish it off!
There’s a kid here.

830
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:49,560
Stop it!

831
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,920
Please try not to hurt me, Sister!

832
01:23:58,640 --> 01:24:01,800
Everything will be fine in a flash.

833
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,520
Let the medicine boil.

834
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:36,760
Who is he? Your servant?

835
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:39,160
Nah, son of a distant relative.

836
01:24:40,160 --> 01:24:41,520
The family is poor, so he’s here.

837
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:45,080
He’s really naughty.
Better keep an eye on him.

838
01:24:56,160 --> 01:25:06,240
(Chanting)

839
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,720
Sister!
I feel better than ever!

840
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:37,560
Now I can play around as I please!

841
01:26:37,560 --> 01:26:38,920
- Is that right?
- Yeah!

842
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,880
Sir, you’re a policeman, right?

843
01:26:56,360 --> 01:26:57,320
How did you know?

844
01:26:57,720 --> 01:26:58,920
I can tell...

845
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:02,880
You can tell from what you do?

846
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:09,880
I can guess a man's job, his birthplace...
even predict his future!

847
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,360
-Shall I?
-Nah!

848
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:15,800
Shall I?

849
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,080
Shall I?

850
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:31,080
Shajiva, I had a revelation
when my back was sprained!

851
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,920
-We have met everyone here, right?
-Mmm

852
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:36,280
None of them’s our man.

853
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,320
So it must be the guy
who’s stayed out of sight.

854
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:40,480
He’s the one! I’m sure.

855
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,520
What if he knows we are here
and doesn’t come back?

856
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:46,400
-Nah! He wouldn’t dare...
-Hey, stop there!

857
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,320
Stop!

858
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,400
Son of a whore! Bastard!

859
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,360
What the hell did you
do to the boy last night?

860
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:56,320
-What the hell did you do to him?
-What is she saying?!

861
01:27:56,760 --> 01:27:59,120
And sneaking off shamelessly
without paying a penny! Scoundrel!

862
01:27:59,120 --> 01:28:00,240
I did nothing, Sister!

863
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,760
Listen to this dirty rascal!
Fooling with a little boy, you creep?

864
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:06,920
-Hey Sister! What are you doing?
-Pretending to know nothing!

865
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:09,360
Let go! Leave him!
We’ll sort this out.

866
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:10,560
-Give me that!

867
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:14,160
-Bastard!
-Here, 1000 bucks. Take it.

868
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:15,400
Leave, man!

869
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,760
Hey, Sister! Wait up!

870
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:26,040
(Indistinct conversation)

871
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:37,920
Mani...

872
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,440
Mani?

873
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:49,320
Hey!

874
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:53,400
Aren’t you married?
Then why the hell did you...?

875
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Didn't I say I didn't do anything?

876
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,800
Never mind. We sorted it out
with just 1000 rupees here.

877
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:00,680
Back home, you’d be
booked for child abuse.

878
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,080
And lakhs in penalty!

879
01:29:02,760 --> 01:29:05,600
She wasn’t just massaging
you last night, was she?!

880
01:29:34,400 --> 01:29:37,400
Thankan, been a while since we last saw you...

881
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,000
Where have you been?

882
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,520
Hey Thankan bro,
I forgot to mention.

883
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,920
Two lowlives have come
to dig rubber pits in your plot!

884
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,000
They’ve been working
and lodging at the liquor shop.

885
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:53,440
Seem like real losers!

886
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:58,640
But I’m not planting rubber.
Why would I dig pits?

887
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:31,040
(Scuffle)

888
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,160
Oh, you’re here!

889
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:34,200
Who were you whoring
around with all this while?

890
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,040
- Where are they?
- Who?

891
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,800
Ah, they’ve gone somewhere to shit!
Will come soon.

892
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:41,200
Why do you let random
dudes stay here in my name?

893
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:44,720
What sort of a question is that?

894
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:47,280
It’s not the first time people
have stayed in your name, is it?

895
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,240
Haven't they come to dig
rubber pits for you?

896
01:30:49,240 --> 01:30:52,360
What the hell?!
Don’t you know I've leased my plot?

897
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:54,440
It’s not me! He brought them!

898
01:30:54,440 --> 01:30:57,160
You thug! Why the fuck do you
bring random assholes here?

899
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,960
Hey Thanka! Don't make me call
you names, you filthy dog!

900
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,920
Let’s see you dare, you motherfucker!

901
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:06,080
Piss off, dick!

902
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,760
- What did they say?
- You tell me!

903
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,080
They came for you!
No one here knows them!

904
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:14,960
You tell us!

905
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,800
Didn't you bring them?
Answer, you scumbag!

906
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:19,680
Who are they? Tell me!

907
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,200
Thanka, get off!
All of us here are crooks!

908
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:27,440
So don't bloody pick a fight!
We’ll kill you, bastard!

909
01:31:32,240 --> 01:31:33,680
Stop it, you scoundrels!

910
01:31:33,680 --> 01:31:35,680
Don't you dare mess with my husband in the name of some
thugs!

911
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,320
I’ll cut you all to pieces fuckers!

912
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,520
They are coming.
Ask them!

913
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,480
Cretins!

914
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,280
No one speak. I’ll ask them.

915
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:55,720
You stay mum.

916
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:01,160
-I think they know something...
-Mmm

917
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:02,720
Don't say anything dumb.

918
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,880
-Just play along.
-Mmm

919
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,040
Who are you, scumbags?

920
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,720
We came to dig pits in Thankan’s plot...

921
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:18,800
Thankan's ass!
Who are you?

922
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,000
-We were called to dig pits...
-By whom?

923
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,080
- To dig pits...
- Where the fuck did you dig your pits?

924
01:32:24,080 --> 01:32:26,800
- We got a call...
- Why did you come here, scumbags?

925
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,320
- Called to dig pits...
- Who the fuck called?

926
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:30,400
Do you know Thankan?

927
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,440
- It's Thankan who...
- I’m Thankan, you filthy motherfuckers!

928
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,120
Have we met?

929
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:38,880
- We were at Koorachund... Got a call...
- Up yours ass!

930
01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:41,640
Have you seen me before?
Do you know me?

931
01:32:41,640 --> 01:32:44,720
-We don't know you... But...
-Why the hell are you here then?

932
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,000
Who’s with you, tell me!

933
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:48,480
Son, don’t you know...?
We came...

934
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,120
Know what?

935
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:52,720
-We did come to dig pits...
-Up your...!

936
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,400
Who’s with you?
How many?

937
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,880
But what’s the problem, brother?
We don’t understand...

938
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:57,000
Tell him, Kariacha!

939
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,600
Shut up, you motherfuckers! bastards!
I don’t frickin’ know these scumbags!

940
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:03,640
Aren’t we talking to you?
Tell us!

941
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:06,200
Speak up, bastard!

942
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:12,080
What did you come here for?
Tell us now!

943
01:33:12,080 --> 01:33:14,320
Messing with Thankan, eh?
Scoundrels!

944
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:16,000
Hey, Thanka! Shut up!

945
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:19,200
Let's not delay any further.
Let's finish them off!

946
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:22,200
- What will we do with the bodies?
- I can't dig pits!

947
01:33:22,200 --> 01:33:24,560
Right. What if the dogs dig it up?

948
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:27,360
Shall we burn them in sugar?

949
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:30,320
We don't have a ration shop
to get enough sugar!

950
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:33,280
Shall we beat them to pulp
and throw them in the river?

951
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:36,560
Let's not waste time.
It's easier if we cut them to pieces!

952
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,920
Why debate so hard to kill someone?
Chuck them into the compost pit,

953
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,160
and bury them deep!

954
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:43,200
It will be good for the coffee there!

955
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:45,760
Finish soon and come back.
We need to make the evening curry.

956
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,080
Move aside, you hoodlums!

957
01:33:58,640 --> 01:33:59,800
-They’ve got a gun!
-Catch him!

958
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:05,200
-Move, move!
-Easy, easy!

959
01:34:06,560 --> 01:34:08,560
-Come here, you!
-Look here...

960
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,040
- What's your real name?
- Thankan!

961
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,000
You twat, we didn't come
to dig pits in your cunts!

962
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,440
We are Kerala Police, you dimwit!
What's your real name?

963
01:34:16,440 --> 01:34:18,480
- Thankan. Thankachan!
- Then who is Mayiladumkunnu Joy?

964
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:23,040
That's not my family name.
Mine is Mayiladumpara! Here...

965
01:34:27,480 --> 01:34:31,800
You’ll chop us up and
burn us in sugar, eh?! you fucker!

966
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:36,320
We are just villagers!
We thought you were thieves.

967
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,920
Would we really do that?!
We were just trying to get to the truth!

968
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:42,200
- Move!
- Where is this Joy?

969
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,200
Joy is at home, Sir!

970
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,200
Walk, you bastard!

971
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,880
Hey Karia scumbag!
I’ll be coming for you later!

972
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:56,480
If you come close I’ll
bust your guts, you cretins!

973
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,280
Don’t you dare!

974
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:10,520
Don’t even think of tricking us!
This bullet can go far, alright?

975
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:19,080
I don’t see him!

976
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:24,280
The rascal knows his
way around. He has escaped!

977
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:39,760
Hey you!

978
01:36:41,960 --> 01:36:43,360
There he is!

979
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,280
Piece of shit! Think you
can give us the slip?

980
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,440
My dear Sir, where would
I go even if I tried?

981
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,360
I'm not the one you’re looking for...

982
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:56,120
Just walk!

983
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:59,000
Sir, don't get lost here...
This is a treacherous place.

984
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:16,960
Isn't there a road to your place?

985
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,520
I don't have the money for that, Sir.

986
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:21,440
We came from Karikottukara
after my parents died...

987
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:24,480
Bought some land,
did some farming...

988
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:28,360
Hey, hey! If we ask about the road,
stick to that!

989
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:30,400
I don't want to know
your frickin’ history!

990
01:37:32,280 --> 01:37:34,080
Is it your army following you?

991
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:36,040
Are you tired, Sir?
Just a little further.

992
01:37:36,440 --> 01:37:37,280
Just walk!

993
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:52,600
- Only a little further...
- Just walk!

994
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,920
-Stop! They are taking that way.
Let’s take the shortcut.

995
01:38:27,560 --> 01:38:31,040
Sir, it's very slippery! Careful.

996
01:38:31,200 --> 01:38:32,040
- Yeah, yeah!

997
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:36,160
What are you doing?

998
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,680
-Hey!
-Just washing my face, gentlemen!

999
01:38:37,680 --> 01:38:39,160
Don't act smart!

1000
01:38:57,480 --> 01:38:59,720
Let's take this short cut.
This way...

1001
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:17,400
Why the heck are they following us?

1002
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,040
There they go! Come on!

1003
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,760
When I turned to see the voice
that spoke to me,

1004
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:26,680
I saw seven golden lampstands.

1005
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,640
And among the lampstands
was one, like the Son of Man.

1006
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,080
He was clothed to his feet...

1007
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:39,960
What’s going on, dear?

1008
01:41:40,360 --> 01:41:42,000
- They’ve come to see Joy...
- Shut up!

1009
01:41:42,920 --> 01:41:44,520
- What's his name?
- Thankan...

1010
01:41:46,040 --> 01:41:46,680
Then who is Joy?

1011
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,240
He is my brother, Sir...

1012
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,120
Where is he?

1013
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:50,960
- Unwell...
- What?

1014
01:41:51,120 --> 01:41:52,000
He is unwell...

1015
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:00,680
He’s paralysed, Sir...

1016
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,560
Joy, you must have
understood the situation...

1017
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:09,480
Enough of this act.
It's time to face the law. Get up!

1018
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:12,760
Sir, I've been lying
this way for a year.

1019
01:42:14,040 --> 01:42:16,120
My life runs on medication now...

1020
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:19,480
What’s the charge on him, Sir?

1021
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:21,640
What will you do with
this paralysed man anyway?

1022
01:42:21,640 --> 01:42:25,200
Ah! Sister, he’s done enough
to get around 10 years in jail!

1023
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:27,440
Poaching endangered wildlife...

1024
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:30,720
And messing around with young boys!

1025
01:42:30,720 --> 01:42:33,920
Sir, it’s true there are
some petty cases against me...

1026
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:37,560
But the rest were pinned on me
by the police and the Forest Officers.

1027
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:40,200
Take pity on me, Sir...

1028
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:42,200
If you take me in this state,
I’ll die there, Sir...

1029
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:46,200
He’s harmless, Sir...
Please help us in some way...

1030
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:48,120
Please show some mercy, Sir...

1031
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:52,320
Whether you’re dead or paralysed,
you’ll be presented before court tomorrow!

1032
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:55,680
There are doctors and nurses in prison too.

1033
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,680
So you’ll take him, will you?
Scumbags!

1034
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,640
Let them try, I dare you scumbags!

1035
01:43:07,040 --> 01:43:09,760
Brother Philip, they say
they want to take our Joy with them.

1036
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:12,400
We were wondering too...
How will they take him?

1037
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:15,320
Move aside!

1038
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,640
Ah, they have shot me...

1039
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:45,200
- Hey Itticha? Itticha!
- What is it?

1040
01:43:45,200 --> 01:43:45,960
Come here!

1041
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,080
They were playing with the gun
and I lost a piece of my ear!

1042
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:50,400
What is it, dear?

1043
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:56,000
-They’ve come all this way to take me.
Let them...

1044
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,160
(Laughter)

1045
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:38,400
What's so funny?

1046
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,560
Nothing, Sir!

1047
01:44:39,560 --> 01:44:42,120
Just laughing over an old story.

1048
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:06,200
Shall I narrate the story, Sir?

1049
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:08,360
Of the Monk and the Madan?

1050
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:10,760
Madan and malarkey!

1051
01:45:21,120 --> 01:45:23,560
Fine, I’ll tell you another story, Sir!

1052
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:26,400
Of a policeman who
once came to catch me

1053
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,640
And one about another policeman.

1054
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:30,920
And one before that too!

1055
01:45:30,920 --> 01:45:32,600
What’s this, a fricking loop?

1056
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,360
A long, long time ago!

1057
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:36,200
Forever ago!
Just tell the story.

1058
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,920
The policeman picked up a guy on his way.

1059
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,760
For company.

1060
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,400
- The Monk...
- Monk?

1061
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:46,960
No, the policeman arrived.

1062
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:50,440
You think their costumes fooled us?

1063
01:45:50,440 --> 01:45:54,200
We pretended we knew nothing...
Winked at each other...

1064
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:58,560
We were curious to see.
How far they would go.

1065
01:45:59,200 --> 01:46:03,280
It’s fun watching the same story
unfold over and over

1066
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:05,320
Shajiva!

1067
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:07,400
I think we’ve lost our way...

1068
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:09,240
Haven't seen that bridge yet.

1069
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:12,120
Fuck! I have no clue either!

1070
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:15,080
Sir, we can go this way.

1071
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,520
Though it is a bit longer and winding...

1072
01:46:16,520 --> 01:46:18,920
You could have told
us earlier, you scumbag!

1073
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,040
Then?!

1074
01:46:25,240 --> 01:46:28,640
The duo settled,
eating and drinking their fill.

1075
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:32,720
They put on fat - eating wild meat
and drinking arrack!

1076
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,760
What's lacking here, Sir?

1077
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:36,200
There are enough whores...

1078
01:46:36,920 --> 01:46:39,720
Need more?
We have other options too... Right?

1079
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:44,000
Want to kill someone?

1080
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,600
You can do that too...

1081
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:48,720
No questions asked.

1082
01:46:48,720 --> 01:46:51,560
Isn’t this paradise, Sir?

1083
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:57,240
Is there anyone who hasn’t
killed or raped at least in their mind?

1084
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:04,160
He grew to love the forest,
the mist and the cold...

1085
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:06,200
Even forgot he was a policeman!

1086
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:08,960
He lost his way...

1087
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:15,320
Finally, when it was time,
we asked them: Who the hell are you?!

1088
01:47:16,080 --> 01:47:18,120
He began to recall...

1089
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:23,240
Then, the Monk,
er, the policeman decides to catch me!

1090
01:47:24,240 --> 01:47:27,160
He even had a toy-like gun!

1091
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:32,520
We found it hilarious!

1092
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,640
My dear Joy, we know your history!

1093
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:40,280
That's why we’ve tied
your paralysed hands.

1094
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:46,800
Sir, if that’s so, just imagine that...

1095
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:49,000
I’m miraculously cured!

1096
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:50,280
Aha! Then?

1097
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:55,200
And imagine I untied myself...
and sat straight!

1098
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:58,120
Wow! And then...?

1099
01:47:58,120 --> 01:48:00,240
Huh?!
