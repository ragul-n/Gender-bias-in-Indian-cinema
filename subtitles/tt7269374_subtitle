1
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,046
Once Rajumon asked me,

2
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:10,678
Who is uncle's father?

3
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,112
I told he is a king.

4
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,973
One with crown, scepter,

5
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:17,444
And a throne.

6
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:18,973
Aking!

7
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,271
Whenever he would see me then,

8
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,238
He used to tease and call me,

9
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,407
Friends Rajakumaran.

10
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
Aking's son.

11
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:30,039
Yes, I am an Uhd6FWOTld prince.

12
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:32,272
I am the prince ofthe Llhd6HNOTld.

13
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,105
My father,

14
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:34,644
He was one of the rowdy in this city.

15
00:02:34,733 --> 00:02:37,236
Yourfather was a snake who used
crawl on the ground after drinking.

16
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,210
Hey Mani.

17
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,670
Speak what you can pronounce properly.

18
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,745
Have you finished all your acts?

19
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:47,211
It's over.

20
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,604
Then do one thing.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,479
Rowdy's son get down from the throne,

22
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,275
Climb that slanted coconut
tree and pluck a bunch of ripe ones.

23
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,242
Okay.

24
00:02:54,667 --> 00:02:56,237
If the Lord says then
nothing to talk back.

25
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:01,008
"L told you before itself not to go,
not to go"

26
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,704
-"Don't go to pluck coconuts"
- Hey Mani.

27
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,278
What?

28
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:04,775
Is it not the season?

29
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:06,774
Yes, it's at the right stage.

30
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,547
If it stays more itwill go hoar
and become rotten coconut like Lord.

31
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:11,241
Hey Raja Mani.

32
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,703
Yes Lord.

33
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,240
Climb four more extra coconut trees,

34
00:03:15,367 --> 00:03:17,677
And try to earn more money
instead of playing frog game.

35
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,404
This is not frog ortoad, Lord.

36
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,637
This is Mimicry, Mimicry.

37
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,074
Oh yeah.

38
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,439
Whatever cry it is,

39
00:03:23,567 --> 00:03:24,978
Cinema is not for you.

40
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,204
Nothing as such, Lord.

41
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:29,077
Someone will give me a chance
and I will become a great actor.

42
00:03:29,633 --> 00:03:30,703
Yes, you will become.

43
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,240
Father drinks toddy and sings around,

44
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,770
And you are like this.

45
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,510
Will the inbuilt quality
go if you just wipe it?

46
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,442
Just see Lord,

47
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,671
Rajamani is native of Chaalakudi,

48
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,144
You will boast this one day.

49
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,043
Yes good boast.

50
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,179
- What?
- No I spoke about the size.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,344
Oh no.

52
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:51,510
Move a little away and
stand Lord without giggling.

53
00:03:51,633 --> 00:03:52,668
Move a little away.

54
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,078
He has come to see the size.

55
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:54,736
Mani.

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,178
Mani.

57
00:03:56,267 --> 00:03:56,768
Mani.

58
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,077
Mani.

59
00:03:58,233 --> 00:03:59,769
- Hey Mani.
- Mani.

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,209
Hey Mani, hey.

61
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,674
Whistling'

62
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,507
Coconuts are all down.

63
00:04:05,667 --> 00:04:07,340
- Mani.
- Mani.

64
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:09,368
Hey Mani.

65
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,410
Look, Iookthe Superstar
is on the coconut tree.

66
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:13,445
What is it?

67
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,045
You can pluckthe coconuts later,
come down first.

68
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:16,043
Come down.

69
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,635
Iam coming.

70
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,738
- Come.
- Who will take the knife then?

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,070
Hey where are you going?

72
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:20,645
Down.

73
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:22,144
- Climb up back.
- Oh this fellow.

74
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:23,303
If not <i>lwill</i> break your legs.

75
00:04:23,467 --> 00:04:25,310
Oh mother, I am climbing.

76
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,411
Don't send him, Lord.

77
00:04:26,633 --> 00:04:29,409
Who are you to say not to come
down without putting the coconuts?

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,570
If it is to drinktoddy
go find someone else.

79
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:32,643
Let him work.

80
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:34,405
Toddy? We?

81
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,442
We were talking about drinking Scotch.

82
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:37,599
Scotch?

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,442
Yes Scotch.

84
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:39,136
From where?

85
00:04:39,233 --> 00:04:41,110
Adding nice grapes, battery and leech,

86
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,213
We made the proper Scotch.

87
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:47,046
When we said Scotch did you
see how the Lord's face turned?

88
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,213
Stop making Lord yearn
and tell the reason why you came.

89
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,745
Hey Mani they took you in cinema.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,741
They called the medical store
and asked you to come quickly.

91
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,377
That's all.

92
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,078
What did you say?

93
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,710
Tell me once again.

94
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,170
Hey dearthey took you in cinema.

95
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:02,404
Oh.

96
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,238
I told you right Lord,

97
00:05:05,533 --> 00:05:07,171
Someone will take me in cinema.

98
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,242
I told you that I will
become an actor right?

99
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,402
They took me in cinema.

100
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,108
Oh no.

101
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,238
Oh I am going.

102
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,541
Hey Mani.

103
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,069
Keep quiet let's
see if he will come up.

104
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,340
They took me in cinema.

105
00:05:38,433 --> 00:05:39,070
Crane down.

106
00:05:39,267 --> 00:05:40,245
Oh will they make me fall.

107
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:44,069
A good frame we got.

108
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:46,140
Chutney is not prepared well.

109
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,072
Crane up.

110
00:05:47,533 --> 00:05:49,410
This is like some street shop chutney.

111
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,738
4 leaf of curry leaves,

112
00:05:52,133 --> 00:05:53,612
Same amount of mint leaves,

113
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,211
A little coriander leaves,

114
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,442
Dry chilli, pearl onions.

115
00:05:57,567 --> 00:05:59,103
You must frythem in oil.

116
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,080
Why do you want to
fry them just eat it.

117
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,042
Once it's fried properly,

118
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:05,678
Add a little ginger,

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,673
And grind it in mortar and pestle.

120
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,207
Add 2 drops of coconut oil,

121
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:11,607
Mix and take it out.

122
00:06:11,767 --> 00:06:13,576
If you prepare like that,

123
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,245
- You can eat 10 idlys more.
- Okay sir.

124
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,607
Eating alone is happening.

125
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,611
If he sees food it's like Balan
K Nair gotJayan's sister in hand.

126
00:06:19,733 --> 00:06:21,269
Sir will eat up everything.

127
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,208
You don't have to worry kid.

128
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,108
Since it's time to eat you are safe.

129
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:25,245
Is it a magazine?

130
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,743
No a book.

131
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,705
Exams, degree exam.

132
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,171
No need of studies anymore.

133
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,712
You are acting with the superstar.

134
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,273
He will teach everything.

135
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:34,573
Everything is my daughter's luck.

136
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:38,046
Sir will make her the busiest actress
in Malayalam, if not I will make her.

137
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,237
- Okay sir.
- Yes, he will do.

138
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:41,274
Sir, sir.

139
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:41,741
Greetings.

140
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:43,706
The character to be
played as actress's sister.

141
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,737
You should apply chili paste properly.

142
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:48,243
Actress's sister'?

143
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,403
When you prepare fish curry,

144
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,480
Ask them to add good
spicy chili paste, okay?

145
00:06:51,533 --> 00:06:52,170
Okay sir.

146
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,274
Sir.

147
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:54,437
She is a gymnastic.

148
00:06:54,567 --> 00:06:55,375
What?

149
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,045
Is there any sword fight here?

150
00:06:57,133 --> 00:06:58,578
Not gymnastic sir.

151
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,075
Kathakali.

152
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,510
<i>She</i> is <i>a Kalathilakam.</i>

153
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,977
From years.

154
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,276
I mean it's her wish from years.

155
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,311
To become a Kalathilakam.

156
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:08,468
She is trying forthat.

157
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:10,269
2 tender coconuts too.

158
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:11,577
This is nice.

159
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,274
Sister's character right?

160
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,271
It's okay.

161
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,068
Spice is a little too much.

162
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,209
Really?

163
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:19,435
We can make it okay right?

164
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:20,475
Crane up.

165
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:21,611
H 6V-

166
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,234
My idly.

167
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,744
<i>Iwill</i> take chutney when
I come the next time.

168
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,144
For the evening,

169
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,074
I need 1 or 2 piece.

170
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,208

Let it 2 piece of chicken.

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,079
Though it's small it's a good role.

173

Will you do it?

174
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:34,711
She will, now she will for sure.

175
00:07:34,767 --> 00:07:35,643
She will shock right?

176
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:36,609
Won't this kid talk anything?

177
00:07:36,733 --> 00:07:38,406
She will talk she
spoke to me on the way.

178
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,036
Like milk she talks.

179
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:40,668
What's your name?

180
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,710

00:07:42,733 --> 00:07:43,541
Mrigali.

182
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,434

Have you acted before?

188
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,240
No.

189
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,702
Not so far.

190
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:55,171
I practice dance though.

191
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,036
<i>Cinematic and Bharatanatyam enough?</i>

192
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,771
Enough, enough dance right,
that's more than enough.

193
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:00,545
Crane up.

194
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,602
Kathakali right I will
teach you the moves.

195
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,540
- I need some water.
- My water.

196
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:05,441
He won't give water too.

197
00:08:05,567 --> 00:08:06,773
Unless I tell you don't
bring down this crane.

198
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,205
Then when should I come down?

199
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,540
It will be only after noon.

200
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:10,643
Go and take rest.

201
00:08:11,267 --> 00:08:12,109
- Come, come.
- Is it fine if I come down after noon?

202
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,234
Come, come, come.

203
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,278
Iwould have fallen from crane now.

204
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:18,242
Sifs next movie is Dolby.

205
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,377
Director liked you.

206
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:22,208
Mrigali.

207
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,745
We must change this name.

208
00:08:24,267 --> 00:08:26,247
After becoming actress they
can change anything right sir?

209
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,413
Once you become a big actress,

210
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,273
You must tell that I am the Godfather.

211
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:32,606
Oh I don't think Kunjapu
will agree for that sir.

212
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,644
Who is that Kunjapu?

213
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,403
Daughter's father.

214
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:35,375
What?

215
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:38,141
Her Godfather is Kunjapu for sure,
I promise.

216
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,740
From there directly bring it down.

217
00:08:42,267 --> 00:08:42,745
Move it this side a little.

218
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,404
It's already started
will they take us now?

219
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:46,575
What?

220
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,010
- He is an actor.
- So?

221
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,474
He came to act.

222
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,237
Act, move to a corner and act.
Let's take.

223
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:54,745
Sir, I came to act
as auto rickshaw driver.

224
00:08:55,267 --> 00:08:56,974
<i>Chaalakudi Rajamani.</i>

225
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,607
A m usician right?

226
00:08:58,767 --> 00:08:59,973
Ifeel so hearing his name.

227
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,976
No, he is a mimicry person.

228
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:04,543
They called to the medical
shop and asked him to come.

229
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,603
Oh.

230
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,540
Did you eat something?

231
00:09:06,767 --> 00:09:07,745
No.

232
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:09,771
Then go and get the makeup done.

233
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:11,973
Let's eat something.

234
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:12,976
No need to take this?

235
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:14,371
Then let's take and then eat.

236
00:09:14,567 --> 00:09:15,739
So like this.

237
00:09:16,567 --> 00:09:19,207
This director has a little attitude.

238
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,507
You become a film star
they will all come behind you.

239
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,713
Why these directors keep
both their hands like this?

240
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,075
- Didn't you understand that?
- No.

241
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,440
If you keep like this.

242
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,978
If you keep like this?

243
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,074
To see bum?

244
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,404
That's a new knowledge.

245
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,603
We just have to hold like this right?

246
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:38,577
- Nice.
- Hey.

247
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,539
Who is doing such dirty work here?

248
00:09:42,467 --> 00:09:43,207
What are you doing here?

249
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,711
Came to act an actor.

250
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:46,068
You an actor?

251
00:09:46,367 --> 00:09:48,040
- No he.
-lt's me.

252
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:48,711
Which role?

253
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,274
We are poor people sir
an auto rickshaw's role.

254
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,674
Auto rickshaw's driver.

255
00:09:52,767 --> 00:09:54,542
Why are you being
sarcastic when said auto?

256
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,772
No sir, not being sarcastic.

257
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,340
Auto rickshaw is our life.

258
00:09:57,433 --> 00:09:59,777
Haven't you seen
Laletan's 'Aye Auto'sir?

259
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,544
Oh so you have come
to become Mohanlal.

260
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,373
Then don't roam around here, go.

261
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:07,303
I know him from before
he has too much of attitude.

262
00:10:07,433 --> 00:10:08,070
H 6V-

263
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,109
What sir?

264
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,306
Is only he acting?

265
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:14,775
Or do all of you have any roles?

266
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,545
We accompanied him.

267
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:20,180
After dusk there is a thing where you
have to buy a full and come to the room.

268
00:10:20,533 --> 00:10:22,274
Really? Shall I do that role?

269
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:23,409
That's nice.

270
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,340
Not role.

271
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:27,412
If you buy a bottle, come
to room and meetthe production guys,

272
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:29,640
Everyone will get a role there
are some practices like that here.

273
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,110
Sir, we don't have any money.

274
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,009
No need sir we don't have money.

275
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:34,407
Can we take loan?

276
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,170
How will you become good in cinema?

277
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:39,111
You first need to be pious
towards the senior people.

278
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:42,137
Oh Radhamani.

279
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:43,575
- Room number 108.
- You are still standing here?

280
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,701
From how long I have
been looking for you?

281
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,411
- Come we have to do make up.
- I am coming.

282
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:55,603
What is this brother?

283
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:57,303
What is wrong with this?
Leave my hand.

284
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,443
Are you new to industry?

285
00:10:58,667 --> 00:10:59,771
Why here?

286
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,137
Anyways salary is less here.

287
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,377
Only these are remaining.

288
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,376
What?

289
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,775
No dear, your skin has to match right?

290
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,272
Did you see?

291
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:13,073
What is this? Dipping her
in paint was better than this.

292
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,305
It should be like this,
that's the beauty.

293
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:16,379
Ifthey put makeup like
this he will become like Mamooty.

294
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:18,276
Most ofthem in cinema are dark.

295
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,401
Everything is makeup.

296
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:21,103
Look, this is an expensive lipstick.

297
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,235
I have not put this to anyone so far,
show me your lips.

298
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,239
Hats offto him,

299
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,708
Look at his luck.

300
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,071
Will they make everyone
in cinema fair like this?

301
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,268
Only for female gender.

302
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,242
Not move here and there.

303
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,971
Oh then in cinema
gender change is needed.

304
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,211
Don't move itwill spread girl.

305
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,370

306
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,377
They asked to get ready
quickly right, you go.

307
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:45,237
If not he will keep
massaging that girl.

308
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,378
Go.

309
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,471
Don't close.

310
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,238
- Keep your eyes open.
- Brother.

311
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:50,739
First shot it seems.

312
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:51,472

313
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:53,203
Makeup for me?

314
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:55,739
You are auto driver right?

315
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,738
This is enough this is correct.

316
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:01,578
- Right dear.
- But a little touchup.

317
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,235
Touch up?

318
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,435
What touchup?

319
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:06,644
- You are an auto driver right?
- Yes.

320
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,246
Not a pilot right?

321
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,310
He needs touchup it seems.

322
00:12:09,433 --> 00:12:10,776
From where they come, right dear?

323
00:12:11,267 --> 00:12:13,178
Look here on this dark face,

324
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,769
If we put pan cake,

325
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,580
It will be like you have got leprosy,
this is enough.

326
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,169
This is correct.

327
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:20,568
What to do?

328
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,477
You show me dear.

329
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:24,306
Will the darkness
go if we wash it brothel'?

330
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:27,346
It will go, your skin will go.

331
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,307
Get up now dear.

332
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,606
Where is that 14 and 15, yes that one.

333

Can you hairs front.

334

Brother can you tell him?

335
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,408
There is no use.

336
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:38,775
Usually I don't do all this,

337
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,579
To anyone.

338
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:41,975
Stand like that.

339
00:12:42,633 --> 00:12:44,340
His makeup.

340
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,041
Why do we need makeup?

341
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,407

00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:04,734
He came so soon?

347
00:13:05,033 --> 00:13:06,273
If he won't see us
will he say anything?

348
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,670
Give that umbrella.

349
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:11,503
- Move aside.
- Come sir.

350
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,403
Move aside.

00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:15,706
Did you see cooling glass is rainbow?

352
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:18,707
What beauty!

353
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,071
- Just like the way he looks in cinema.
- Correct.

354
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,703
Look at that style.

355
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,603
Will it be makeup?

356
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,505
- I had called you sir.
- Am I late?

357
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,408
No.

358
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,706

00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:42,110
I tried doing it a little differently.

365
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,235

00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:50,076
That feeling was known.

370
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:53,377
Let sir go.

371
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,136
Sir, is Nithyagarbini shoot over'?

372
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:55,745
Don't push.

373
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,479
What sir, to see right?

374
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,578
Sir, you walk sir.

375
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,144
Let's walk and push.

376
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,246
We have shot 3 to 4 films here right?

377
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:04,071
Yes, luck location sir.

378
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,177
If you want we can change
the location, what do you say?

379
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:07,974
Why to make the movie flop?
Just keep quiet.

380
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,101
First is it front shot?

381
00:14:09,233 --> 00:14:10,041
Is it?

382
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,477
From up to down.

383
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,135
Isn't track enough?

384
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:12,641
Isn't it enough?

385
00:14:12,767 --> 00:14:14,769
- Crane will be good.
- Crane cut. We can put track right?

386
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,569
Did I ask you to cut?
Ijust asked for an opinion.

387
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:17,702
I will cut you off.

388
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,041
They are calling for
an inauguration party on 11th.

389
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,579
- Will it happen for 25 Iakhs?
-lt won't.

390
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,475
We can ask them to change the date.

391
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:32,741
Shall we start sir?

392
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:34,737
Who is that girl, John?

393
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,070
Radhamani, a simple lady.

394
00:14:36,233 --> 00:14:37,439
Not that,
the one who was sitting there.

395
00:14:37,767 --> 00:14:40,043
She is the one who has
come to act as your sister.

396
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:41,537
My sister?

397
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:44,439
How will that be right?

398
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:45,705
That's not right.

399
00:14:46,067 --> 00:14:47,603
It's not right.

400
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,045
Sir, she is good girl.

401
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,576
Director saw and
liked so she was called.

402
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,441
Is it enough if only director sees?

403
00:14:53,733 --> 00:14:54,643
I should also know, my sister right?

404
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:55,507
Correct.

405
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:56,472
Not that John.

406
00:14:57,033 --> 00:14:58,103
No height.

407
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,108
Oh sir height is there it
looked so because she was sitting.

408
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:01,075
She is a known girl to me.

409
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,737
<i>Iwill</i> make her stand and show.

410
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:04,171
Her attitude is not good.

411
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,335
She should have
respect to her seniors.

412
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,308
It's not right.

413
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:09,276
Not just that,
that cast is not good John.

414
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:10,309
Sir, let's think once again.

415
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,572
No need, no need.

416
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,735
They are poor ones..

417
00:15:13,033 --> 00:15:13,773
- Who camefrom Kannoor sir.
- John.

418
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:16,071
You have to work in my films.

419
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,177
We don't want that.

420
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,035
Understood? Go.

421
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:20,575
Don't lose yourjob, go.

422
00:15:20,733 --> 00:15:22,007
No height sir.

423
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,273
- Hair is also less.
- Yes.

424
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,144
Sir.

425
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:26,075
Here is your shirt.

426
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:33,140
399 ru pees?

427
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:35,008
I think it's from footpath.

428
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,078
This is dull.

429
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,473
Sir as per this situation,

430
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,580
Director only said
dull shirt is enough.

431
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,010
Dull is enough but buy
a branded one and make it dull.

432
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,080
Right? Don't you know that Prakash?

433
00:15:45,167 --> 00:15:45,611
Yes.

434
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,303
- I should wearthis right?
- Yes.

435
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,240
If you don't know this small thing then
how will I suggest you forthe next film?

436
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,643
I will change and buy now sir.

437
00:15:52,233 --> 00:15:53,610
No sense at all.

438
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:55,610
Sad, they have come
with shirt worn for coolie.

439
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,110
First you do your work properly.

440
00:15:57,267 --> 00:15:59,110
Sir, after this scene.

441
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:00,371
Oh cigarette is over.

442
00:16:00,433 --> 00:16:01,241
- Go get a 5 pack cigarette.
- Okay sir.

443
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,004
Hey, hey give my mixture and go.

444
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,408
- Now go.
-5 pack cigarette.

445
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:07,112
Is he eating even cigarettes?

446
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,372
Sir I told you that he won't like
this, seems like <i>lwill</i> lose myjob.

447
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,476
What's wrong with this shirt?

448
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:12,975
He wants branded one.

449
00:16:13,133 --> 00:16:14,476
Hold this, just hold don't eat.

450
00:16:15,733 --> 00:16:16,973
399 rupees.

451
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:18,409
Listen.

452
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,773
There is way to tame these superstars.

453
00:16:21,033 --> 00:16:22,444
What is he an elephant?

454
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,213
If it's elephant we can explain and make
it understand because it has brains.

455
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,245
How much was the coat
we bought yesterday?

456
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,073
3400 rupees.

457
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:31,538
Remove the tag from that
coat and put it on this shirt.

458
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,611
Then take this shirt
and give it to that star.

459
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,508
My sir you are genius.

460
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,601
- Now you understood?
- Yes sir.

461
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:38,973
How to tame superstars.

462
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:40,045
Oh yes I understood well.

463
00:16:40,233 --> 00:16:41,507
Okay sir, okay sir.

464
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,008
Son one boost too.

465
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:43,973
Take the mixture.

466
00:16:44,467 --> 00:16:47,414
Sir, we had taken 23 brands.

467
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:48,637
Director said no.

468
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,211
Butwill I agree sir'?

469
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,771
This is nice, you know the work.

470
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,344
How is it sir'?

471
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,236
Though it's dull it's branded.

472
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,675
Yes sir. Next movie is okay.

473
00:17:01,433 --> 00:17:02,343
Sir.

474
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:03,537
Keep the mixture there.

475
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,111
Once you sleep and get up.

476
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:07,210
If Rajkumar sir changes his mind.

477
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:08,737
Let's make them stay here.

478
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,345
The room rent is less
in the hotel that I stay.

479
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,246
Then make them stay in your room.

480
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:21,070
Thanks, there is no
change once you say it sir.

481
00:17:21,533 --> 00:17:22,375
How old is that girl?

482
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,308
17 years.

483
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,240
IPC 168.

484
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:27,745
Molestation, 7 years you
can sit in jail and eat rice balls.

485
00:17:28,033 --> 00:17:29,068
Oh God.

486
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:29,768
No need, no need, no need.

487
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,277
They have made many rules so that
we cannot peacefully work and live.

488
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,208
Scene 6, bathroom.

489
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:34,970
Sir.

490
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,210
Shall we leave?

491
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:37,141
Go.

492
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,338
Sir, did I do any mistake sir'?

493
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,079
If you ask so.

494
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:41,768
But sir.

495
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,138
The artist which is lying inside my
daughter should be bought out somehow.

496
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:47,176
What should we do for that?
You tell us sir.

497
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,179
When you see a superstar
you must get up and stand,

498
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,371
You don't have such
small cinema knowledge too.

499
00:17:52,533 --> 00:17:54,308
Here people are ready to stand naked.

500
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,381
I mean to stand as said and you?

501
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,476
Radhamani.

502
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,375
-706, 706.
- He will eat balls.

503
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,604
So Hero's sister is out.

504
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,773
Then why don't you
give this grandma a role?

505
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,745
Nice cut, she will fill the screen.

506
00:18:07,067 --> 00:18:08,569
- Get out.
- Don't eat me up.

507
00:18:08,733 --> 00:18:10,178
From there,

508
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,674
You must bring the
vehicle and stop it here.

509
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:12,245
Okay.

510
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,368
Then sirwill give money.

511
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:15,012
Then you must take the vehicle and go.

512
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:15,606
Okay.

513
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,745
No need to give back the change?

514
00:18:17,033 --> 00:18:17,568
No need.

515
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,404
So I don't have any dialogues?

516
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:21,135
Sir will ask how much rupee.

517
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,676
You should 25 rupees.

518
00:18:22,767 --> 00:18:23,472
Okay?

519
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,735
- Understood?
- Yes, understood.

520
00:18:25,133 --> 00:18:26,339
- Art.
- Hey.

521
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,144
I have dialogue too.

522
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,143
Really? Is it big?

523
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,371
Not big, 25 rupees that's it.

524
00:18:31,467 --> 00:18:33,174
That's too small.

525
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,301
- There is an idea for that.
- What?

526
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,277
You are saying only 25 rupees right?

527
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:38,377
Instead of that,

528
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,003
Because it's you give
me only 25 rupees sir.

529
00:18:41,267 --> 00:18:43,076
Then your face will be
in screen for some more time.

530
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:44,073
That's good.

531
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:46,238
That's awesome, <i>lwill</i> smash it today.

532
00:18:46,367 --> 00:18:47,710
People will talk many
things like this about me.

533
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,570
There won't be any problem
if you sharethe number.

534
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,244
Go, g0. 9°-

535
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,577
Get up is super sir.

536
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:54,534
Yes.

537
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,042
Good that you put track.

538
00:18:56,433 --> 00:18:57,969
Opening shot track is the best.

539
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,237
For this ambience.

540
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,305
Crane is good.

541
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:02,336
Crane.

542
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:03,507
Got scared.

543
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,409
Sir, next shot we
will be taking in crane.

544
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:05,968
Enough.

545
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:07,104
Let's start.

546
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:09,110
- No need of crane?
-lmmediately you had to say crane?

547
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,234
Radhamani call me back later.

548
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,278

Yes, new fellow.

555
00:19:24,033 --> 00:19:25,603
He doesn't know much about industry.

556
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,741

feet and take blessing.

557

You removed it?

569
00:19:55,433 --> 00:19:57,470
I knew it when I saw
his overflowing humbleness.

570
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,238
Who brought him?

571
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,242

00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,746

Let them call, calling you right?

587
00:20:21,533 --> 00:20:22,637
Iam not a superstar.

588
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:23,575
Action.

589
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:26,068

Because it's you give me only 25 sir.

We clapped seeing your acting.

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,599
To clap so much.

613
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,273
That look is killer.

614
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,007
Everyone will clap.

615
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,339
This is emotional acting.

616
00:21:20,467 --> 00:21:24,176
"Parali, Parali, <i>aa</i> Parali Poovali parali"

617
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:28,213
"Parali, Parali, <i>aa</i> Parali Poovali parali"

618
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:32,077
"Parali, Parali, <i>aa</i> Parali Poovali parali"

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,437

Give more 100 ml to everyone.

622
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:39,410
Just give.

623
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,504

00:21:44,067 --> 00:21:46,069
Bring 4 more eggs in
the name of cinema actor.

626
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,136
Notjust an actor,

627
00:21:48,233 --> 00:21:51,009
The actor who acted
along with the super star.

628
00:21:51,267 --> 00:21:53,679
It's like stepping on Jackfruit.

629
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,972
I am not getting balance.

630
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,771
Jackfru it is your father.

631
00:21:56,067 --> 00:21:56,977
Oh no father.

632
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:57,511
Oh father.

634
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,641
Hey son, stop.

635
00:21:59,767 --> 00:22:01,075
Come here.

636
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:03,579
Today is a celebration
for Chaalakudi people.

637
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,402
For everyone who comes here today,

638
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,409
They will get toddy and
egg free on behalf of Ramappan.

639
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,637
- Come.
- Toddy means I will lose control.

640
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,775
- Mine too.
- My control is gone long back.

641
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,738
It's the celebration
of you becoming an actor here.

642
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,138
Actor, sit here.

643
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,671
- Since you are a beginner.
- Little is enough.

644
00:22:19,767 --> 00:22:21,713
You should drink slowly.

645
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:24,071
<i>Oh it was Ramappan.</i>

646
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:25,976
Nice.

647
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:27,134
If not the chest will burn.

648
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,073
Then take a chili,

649
00:22:39,467 --> 00:22:40,673
Sukhu is also forthe firsttime.

650
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,771
He is not a beginner.

651
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:43,568
No, it's first time.

652
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:44,407
Did you see that?

653
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,444
See the way he is drinking.

654
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,977
What drinking is this?

655
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:48,075
Shop keeper,

656
00:22:48,233 --> 00:22:49,211
Give him one more bottle.

657
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,142
Do you want more, bill has become more.

658
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,980
What did you think about Ramappan?

659
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:56,338
Ramappan will come tomorrow in Benz car.

660
00:22:56,433 --> 00:22:57,377
Ratio card?

661
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,447
Ramappan will drive
through this field and come.

662
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:01,773
Right Ramappa.

663
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:03,768
Oh okay.

664
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,546
So you drank with the
money kept for ration.

665
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:08,478
We can buy ration tomorrow as well.

666
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:11,411
But toddy which has to be drank
today should be drunk today. -True.

667
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,377
Maybe tomorrow you won't
have the liver to drink tomorrow.

668
00:23:13,567 --> 00:23:15,046
These kids don't know
anything about it Ramappa.

669
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,237
The day my son became an actor.

670
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:19,777
I will make the entire Chaalakudi drink.

671
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,080
True, this coconut tree
climber Rajamani in cinema,

672
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,405
What did you call? Tree climber?

673
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,604
Is he not tree climber?

674
00:23:26,767 --> 00:23:28,440
Call him actor, you dog.

675
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:29,705
Cinema actor.

676
00:23:29,767 --> 00:23:31,269
Notjust an actor,

677
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,540
Super star actor.

678
00:23:34,033 --> 00:23:36,274
He will become the king of Chaalakudi.

679
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,071
Do you know that?

680
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:38,974
I know.

681
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,271
How do you know that?

682
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:44,070
The lady who stopped
delivering will deliver,

683
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:46,174
And that kid will become king,

684
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:50,008
After that astrologer
said this Rajamani was born,

685
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:51,510
My father used to tell me these stories.

686
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,977
Will you make such lies?

687
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,170
Don't hit him.

688
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,413
What he said istrue.

689
00:23:56,633 --> 00:24:00,012
Amani who stopped her
pregnancy I made her pregnant.

690
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:02,008
This Rajamani.

691
00:24:02,433 --> 00:24:04,276
That astrologer who
said that day was so true.

692
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:08,141
Once when I was sitting like this in shop.

693
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:11,039
His elder sister came and told me.

694
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,306
Amani fainted and fell.

695
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,580
Amani sister open your eyes.

696
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,440
Amani.

697
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,678
Amani sister.

698
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:22,472
Amani.

699
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,476
Amani.

700
00:24:32,033 --> 00:24:32,977
Amani.

701
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:35,275
Amani.

702
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,406
Is it true?

703
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,437
What astrologer said didn't go wrong.

704
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:47,102
Oh.

705
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:25,745
Master,

706
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,245
You rang the bell 10 minutes earlier.

707
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:29,745
Shanta teacher I am very hungry.

708
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,536
Oh nice smell.

709
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,303
I should have failed LP and studied there.

710
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,537
I could have got porridge there.

711
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:39,409
But we can fail only
thrice in a class, then how?

712
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:40,737
I feel like eating.

713
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,372
Iam so hungry.

714
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,010
Keep quiet those kids
will get diarrhea come.

715
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,640
Last bunch of tamarind.

716
00:25:50,234 --> 00:25:51,770
If it's over what will we do?

717
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,374
I didn't get.

718
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:54,538
Put for me too.

719
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:55,441
Catch.

00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,577
Push hard kids.

721
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:16,737
Uttaman has reached early today.

722
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,536
Today the rush was low.

723
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,370
If this was unloaded soon,

724
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,344
Thangappan is on leave today.

725
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:24,274
It would be good if you unload it.

726
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,435
I will pay you extra for it.

727
00:26:25,534 --> 00:26:27,514
I can't master I am old.

728
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:29,738

If you pay methe money.

733
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:38,707
I can give that at home to pay ration.

734
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,302
You cannot do that Mani.

735
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:42,708
Even if you don't pay me I will unload it.

736
00:26:43,067 --> 00:26:44,546
Give me a hand brother.

737
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,006
Mango is good right.

738
00:26:50,633 --> 00:26:52,203
Do you feel like eating sour mango now?

739
00:27:01,767 --> 00:27:02,973
Wait.

740
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,741
Mani little porridge is
remaining drink if you want.

741
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:07,341
No need, I had.

742
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:10,243
Oh like you have had feast and come.

743
00:27:10,667 --> 00:27:12,669
I saw you climbing that Mango tree.

744
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,408
Drink this kid.

745
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,170
I am in UP sister.

746
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:18,071
Don't see UP and LP now drinkthis.

747
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,544
Hold this.

748
00:27:21,267 --> 00:27:22,245
Drink.

749
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,571
Hey Mani.

750
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:28,976
Sukhu and Raju also have
not eaten anything sister.

751
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:30,712
Shall we three share this?

752
00:27:30,767 --> 00:27:31,711
So what.

753
00:27:35,734 --> 00:27:36,610
Eat.

754
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:47,112
Where are you going in hurry?

755
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,572
Menon sir is selecting kids for drama.

756
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,669
- In 7B.
- You all are good artists right.

757
00:27:52,034 --> 00:27:54,207
Here is your pay for unloading it.

758
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:56,272
- Go.
- Come.

759
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,443
Acting and singing.

760
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:01,205
Mixed them and drank,

761
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,075
I am such an artist.

762
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:04,678
Not just a teacher.

763
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,113
The drama that I am directing

764
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:10,247
In this fest the cup for drama.

765
00:28:10,633 --> 00:28:12,544
<i>Iwill</i> bring it to our school.

766
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:16,046
Karnan is the drama's name.

767
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:19,176
If Master is directing it.

768
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,278
This time's cup,

769
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:21,639
We will have to steal it and come.

770
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:23,569
Silence, silence.

771
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,440
Hey, hey.

772
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,408
What did you say?

773
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,672
I said I will be Karnan.

774
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,677
Oh right face to be the Karnan.

775
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,502
Face of the chameleon, sit there.

776
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,509
Karnan will be Vasu Kuttan Nair.

777
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:34,613
Now we need Krishnan.

778
00:28:34,733 --> 00:28:35,211
Master.

779
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,109
If Rajamani becomes
Krishnan he will nail it.

780
00:28:37,267 --> 00:28:38,075
Yes.

781
00:28:38,234 --> 00:28:38,735
What?

782
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:40,241
What is that?

783
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:41,070
Yes.

784
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:43,468
Krishnan.

785
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,613
God's are not dark.

786
00:28:45,767 --> 00:28:47,303
They will be very fair.

787
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,442
They will look beautiful too.

788
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,580
This is not good.

789
00:28:54,534 --> 00:28:56,741
My father has told that
Krishnan is in black color.

790
00:28:57,067 --> 00:28:58,205
Who Ramappan?

791
00:28:58,433 --> 00:28:59,377
Lucky that he didn't say,

792
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:01,604
Black coconut tree climber.

793
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,574
According to your opinion teacher,

794
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,737
Who is there in this group to be Krishnan?

795
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,711
Rajamani acts very well.

796
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,606
Not just that we call Krishnan
as beauty of black clouds.

797
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:13,408
So is the black color a problem master?

798
00:29:13,567 --> 00:29:15,376
It's a problem, it is a problem.

799
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:17,046
It's my problem that I asked your opinion.

800
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:19,704
Can you give me any other role master'?

801
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,071
This is not a colony drama Rajamani.

802
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,745
When we get some plays for schedule caste,

803
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,135
I will give you a role.

804
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,335
But not in this drama.

805
00:29:27,433 --> 00:29:28,537
Okay.

806
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,213
In art and life,

807
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:33,141
Colony is colony.

808
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:35,406
And temple is temple.

809
00:29:40,567 --> 00:29:42,205
Oh God what rain is this?

810
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,278
When it started.

811
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,543
This fire is not lighting up.

812
00:29:48,634 --> 00:29:49,408
Amani.

813
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:50,443
Iam coming.

814
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,009
Take the kids and sleep under the table.

815
00:29:54,433 --> 00:29:56,379
It's been 3 years since
this roof is leaking.

816
00:29:56,467 --> 00:29:57,969
You don't have to know anything.

817
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,011
Keep it soon.

818
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,271
This is called water reservation.

819
00:30:06,234 --> 00:30:08,771
Ask those kids not to sleep,
it will be ready now.

820
00:30:09,133 --> 00:30:11,511
Are you making feast?

821
00:30:11,733 --> 00:30:13,770
Don't make me speak.

822
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:16,377
With the money that boy
gave I bought this tapioca.

823
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,045
You have only drinking.

824
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:21,011
"Tapioca which the dear kid bought"

825
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:24,477
"My Amani prepared the tapioca"

826
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,081
"Tapioca good with green chili"

827
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,742
"You can't stop munching
no matter how much you eat son"

828
00:30:33,033 --> 00:30:34,103
Mani.

829
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:36,977
Are you sleeping keeping your eyes open?

830
00:30:38,267 --> 00:30:39,177
Hey Mani.

831
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:40,978
What?

832
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:43,578
Like how we humans have,

833
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:46,543
Do the Gods to have different caste?

834
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,202
Caste for God?

835
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,105
When did that happen?

836
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,376
Who told you this?

837
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,136
Menon master.

838
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,539
Their Gods are fair.

839
00:30:56,733 --> 00:30:58,235
And ours are dark it seems.

840
00:30:58,433 --> 00:30:59,969
So he didn't take me in drama too.

841
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:03,239
So you play in the drama of humans.

842
00:31:04,267 --> 00:31:06,543
Humans are biggerthan God.

843
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,976
Do you know that?

844
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,237
I need God's dramas.

845
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,402
I want to play that drama.

846
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:15,647
But master won't teach me that.

847
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:28,771
What is this?

848
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:30,735
Do you know father'?

849
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:32,746
Me?

850
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,307
<i>Drama?</i>

851
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,046
I know only humans language.

852
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:40,736
Look.

853
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,111
The biggest master.

854
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:46,034
It's Him.

855
00:31:46,767 --> 00:31:48,474
<i>You know Ekalavya?</i>

856
00:31:48,734 --> 00:31:50,042
Who isthat? Master?

857
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,201
Not master.

858
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,546
Akid like you.

859
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:57,073
The desire to learn is enough.

860
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,136
But that desire.

861
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:02,612
It should grow here.

862
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,709
Once it grows, grows, grows, grows.

863
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,570
Grows, grows, grows, grows.

864
00:32:16,767 --> 00:32:18,337
The band is becoming good.

865
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:22,974
If he gets the drum
he don't want anything else.

866
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,135
He will be in thatgroup.

867
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:25,245
He is standing there.

868
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:30,145
H 6V-

869
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,105
Hey Mani.

870
00:32:33,133 --> 00:32:34,203
You are here?

871
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,368
It's so late don't you want to go?

872
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,140
Iwas waiting for you.

873
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:37,768
You come.

874
00:32:38,033 --> 00:32:38,670
Hold this.

875
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,540
Iam 910N19-

876
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,705
I have an interview in Kalasadan.

877
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,741
God, hope I get it. Come.

878
00:32:44,734 --> 00:32:45,405
Hey Sukhu.

879
00:32:45,733 --> 00:32:46,575
What is the interview for?

880
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:47,711
Is it a peon job?

881
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,239
Peon job?

882
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,672
Forget peon even for
collectofs job we won't go.

883
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,308
We are artists.

884
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:55,572
Proper education is also needed for that.

885
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:56,973
Notjust education,

886
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:58,109
You need good looks too.

887
00:32:58,267 --> 00:32:59,041
Like me.

888
00:32:59,134 --> 00:33:00,442
Stop talking nonsense and come.

889
00:33:00,567 --> 00:33:01,773
- That'sjelousy.
- Hey Mani.

890
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,603
- What?
- Are you taking vehicle out in the night?

891
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:05,269
- Why?
- That Ram esh has asked.

892
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,435
Oh don't betray.

893
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,580
I will finish the program
tonight and take the vehicle.

894
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:11,147
Tomorrow to take mother
to doctor I need money.

895
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,011
Start the vehicle.

896
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:15,213
- So Mani joined the Kalaulsavam?
- Yes!

897
00:33:15,434 --> 00:33:17,038
Hey our Mani joined the Kalaulsavam.

898
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,976
Brother, really?

899
00:33:19,767 --> 00:33:20,507
Where is he?

900
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:21,738
By the way where is he?

901
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:32,738
Oh my God see how much he is applying.

902
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:34,068
Keep it back.

903
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:35,245
Let me put a little brother.

904
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,402
I bought it paying money.

905
00:33:36,533 --> 00:33:37,238
- He is here.
- Go from here.

906
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,677
Hey Mani you are here?

907
00:33:43,033 --> 00:33:43,602
What is this?

908
00:33:44,034 --> 00:33:44,739
Ponds!

909
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:45,771
Wipe it off!

910
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,080
There shouldn't be a
problem in the name of black.

911
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,645
That feeling is good!

912
00:33:50,367 --> 00:33:51,402
How is it now?

913
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:52,204
Best!

914
00:33:52,334 --> 00:33:54,245
Now it looks like the
kitchen is white washed!

915
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,305
Not that.

916
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,743
Where everl go they say my skin is black,

917
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,570
And come back losing that's the routine.

918
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:00,738
So thistime I thought
let me be a little fair.

919
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,606
If you become fair like this
my family will be left with nothing.

920
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,541
It's bad, take it off.

921
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,542
You don't worry.

922
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:07,737
There is a father there.

923
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,206
He is dark!

924
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,970
No, father is fair!

925
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,544
Not father his dress.

926
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:13,772
Oh the dress!

927
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:15,271
You are not the old Mani now.

928
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:17,606
He is a cinema actor, actor!

929
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:18,644
Tomorrow's Mamooty!

930
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,508
Our dark Mamooty!

931
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:22,068
Oh!

932
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:24,275
No one can defeat this Chandu.

933
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:27,607
My father who fought
and died he defeated Adhiman.

934
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,607
When you share the love,

935
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,274
Master whose hands shivered.

936
00:34:31,433 --> 00:34:32,707
He too defeated me!

937
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,339
To take the failures,

938
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,501
Chandu's life,

939
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,772
Is still remaining!

940
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,574
Go back kids.

941
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:39,769
Go back!

942
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:41,102
- Enough, enough.
- Enough?

943
00:34:41,567 --> 00:34:43,274
We have heard this a lot.

944
00:34:43,367 --> 00:34:45,745
There are lot of people
here a lot to enact the actors.

945
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,603
- Do you have anything new?
- Yes father.

946
00:34:47,734 --> 00:34:48,735
Not eating, do you have?

947
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,608
I have a different one!

948
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:50,745
Then show.

949
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,573
Show, show.

950
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,444
'Tongue twister'

951
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,103
'Tongue twister'

952
00:35:13,267 --> 00:35:15,338
'Tongue twister'

953
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:17,606
'Tongue twister'

954
00:35:17,734 --> 00:35:20,010
'Tongue twister'

955
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,046
'Tongue twister'

956
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:24,147
'Tongue twister'

957
00:35:24,267 --> 00:35:25,746
'Tongue twister'

958
00:35:26,033 --> 00:35:27,103
This is good father!

959
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:27,745
What?

960
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:29,569
No we said it's pretty good.

961
00:35:29,734 --> 00:35:31,304
Is this a group song?

962
00:35:31,467 --> 00:35:33,674
I am sitting here to say that.

963
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:34,575
Okay.

964
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,272
It's good.

965
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,671
But it's not that good.

966
00:35:42,567 --> 00:35:44,706
If needed we will call you.

967
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:47,543
Father, I have one more item.

968
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,111
Show it then.

969
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:51,046
One minute father I will show.

970
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:52,408
Is it something to do with the dhoti?

971
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,705
It's Hanuman!

972
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:55,576
This is usual one.

973
00:35:55,734 --> 00:35:57,577
No need of any opinions.

974
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,735
<i>Iwill tell.</i>

975
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:11,769
Super! Super!

976
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,401
It's not good.

977
00:36:13,534 --> 00:36:14,512
No.

978
00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:19,612
Good!

979
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:22,603
I need a pant.

980
00:36:22,734 --> 00:36:24,611
Only then it looks even better.

981
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,110
Fool you have come for an interview.

982
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,371
So you should have worn one and come.

983
00:36:30,734 --> 00:36:33,112
Father, I have only one pant.

984
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:34,507
I have put it for wash,

985
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,704
I have program in the evening.

986
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:38,474
From next stage you will also be there.

987
00:36:38,667 --> 00:36:39,509
What?

988
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,477
Father, next stage means

989
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:43,771
Should I come tomorrow?

990
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:47,111
Why? Is there any problem
with dates for sir?

991
00:36:47,234 --> 00:36:48,645
Not for that.

992
00:36:49,434 --> 00:36:52,643
Tomorrow there is a release
ofa film in which I acted.

993
00:36:53,134 --> 00:36:55,045
- That's why.
- Oh you are a cinema actor'?

994
00:36:55,134 --> 00:36:56,238
Nothing as such!

995
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,344
I won't increase your
salary because of that okay?

996
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,173
There are rules for everything here.

997
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:02,573
I will give you accordingly.

998
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,037
Father.

999
00:37:04,334 --> 00:37:06,007
Will you come Father to see my movie?

1000
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,075
Me?

1001
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:09,145
I will be happy if you come father.

1002
00:37:09,334 --> 00:37:10,574
You can see my acting too.

1003
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:11,738
Let me see.

1004
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,607
Let's go father.

1005
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:18,010
Cinema might have started now.

1006
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,137
Not to watch the cinema
she wants to see him.

1007
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:22,242
- Go.
- Look at her shyness.

1008
00:37:23,334 --> 00:37:25,507
"To pick the hail stones"

1009
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:27,978
"Open the umbrella"

1010
00:37:28,567 --> 00:37:30,444
"To pick the hail stones"

1011
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:33,447
"Open the umbrella"

1012
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,305
Cinema actor,

1013
00:37:36,434 --> 00:37:38,243
- When did you come?
- I just came.

1014
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:39,175
Shekarankutty.

1015
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,704
You said 13?

1016
00:37:41,234 --> 00:37:44,113
But we are around 16 of them.

1017
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:44,974
Oh!

1018
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,737
Shekarankutty, 16 first class.

1019
00:37:47,134 --> 00:37:47,737
I will take.

1020
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,338
When you 16,

1021
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,969
It comes around 240 rupees.

1022
00:37:51,134 --> 00:37:52,738
I will come only if it is free ticket.

1023
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:55,638
Then an actorfrom ourtown means,

1024
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,607
It's an epic!

1025
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:58,704
That's why.

1026
00:37:58,767 --> 00:38:00,713
He is an actor, there is
no need oftickets to watch cinema.

1027
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,110
Now there is nothing such as freeticket.

1028
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,779
But Rajamani will get.

1029
00:38:05,134 --> 00:38:06,112
Give it here.

1030
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:07,409
How many scenes are there?

1031
00:38:07,467 --> 00:38:09,037
4 dialogues are there.

1032
00:38:09,233 --> 00:38:11,179
As a driver along with Rajkumar sir.

1033
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,679
4 dialogues with Rajkumar sir?

1034
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,445
That's epic.

1035
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,405
Did you see?

1036
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,307
Maybe this is enough to change the fate.

1037
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:20,705
Oh my son's fate is changed.

1038
00:38:21,034 --> 00:38:21,671
Okay.

1039
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,241
Why did you lie to Kuriachan?

1040
00:38:24,434 --> 00:38:25,412
Lie? Me?

1041
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:26,239
Then is it me?

1042
00:38:26,434 --> 00:38:27,504
It was you who said 4 dialogues.

1043
00:38:27,634 --> 00:38:28,738
Yes, there are 4 dialogues.

1044
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:30,104
Where are the 4 dialogues?

1045
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:31,371
Say that dialogue.

1046
00:38:31,467 --> 00:38:32,571
Normally it's 35.

1047
00:38:32,734 --> 00:38:35,681
Because it's sir, give me only 25.
Where is 4 dialogue in this?

1048
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,377
Normal is one.

1049
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:38,571
35 is two.

1050
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,008
Because it's sir is three.

1051
00:38:40,134 --> 00:38:41,238
25 is four.

1052
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:42,539
Give me is five.

1053
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:44,076
In real there are 5 dialogues.

1054
00:38:44,134 --> 00:38:45,340
I said one less.

1055
00:38:45,434 --> 00:38:46,742
Come let's watch the movie.

1056
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,577
They said first class ticket,

1057
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,077
The seat is in the back.

1058
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:51,640
Let's sit in the front Ramappa.

1059
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,638
If it was so we could have seen first.

1060
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:56,407
Cinema means watching
it by sitting behind.

1061
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,342
Oh!

1062
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,570
In our childhood,

1063
00:38:58,733 --> 00:38:59,541
We used to sit in the front and watch.

1064
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,670
That's floor!

1065
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,638
That was floor ticket.

1066
00:39:02,767 --> 00:39:03,768
Oh!

1067
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:07,104
When me and Lord came for
the first time to watch cinema.

1068
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:09,247
We were sitting in the front.

1069
00:39:09,334 --> 00:39:10,540
Lord wanted,

1070
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,144
To touch Abhilasha.

1071
00:39:12,634 --> 00:39:14,204
Don't speak nonsense Ramappa.

1072
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,777
You told me not to touch Abhilasha.

1073
00:39:16,134 --> 00:39:18,478
- Can we forget her?
- Who?

1074
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:19,602
Abhilasha.

1075
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,208
Forfun!

1076
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:24,445
- Hey Mani.
- What Lord?

1077
00:39:24,533 --> 00:39:26,206
Ask them to start soon.

1078
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:28,040
People are waiting to put
coconuts there in the field.

1079
00:39:28,167 --> 00:39:29,077
So what Lord?

1080
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:31,577
Just because you are cinema
guy should we work in field?

1081
00:39:32,267 --> 00:39:33,439
This fellow.

1082
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:41,207
Is that our Koran's daughter?

1083
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,073
Notjust Koran's daughter.

1084
00:39:43,134 --> 00:39:45,614
She is our actor's heroine too.

1085
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:52,037
What's that?

1086
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,374
That's greetings father.

1087
00:39:54,634 --> 00:39:55,704
Greetings.

1088
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,576
When my son cinema actor came,

1089
00:39:57,734 --> 00:39:59,304
Did you see they greeted.

1090
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,708
Come,

1091
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:02,371
Sit.

1092
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,340
Did the movie start?

1093
00:40:10,434 --> 00:40:12,072
Yes, it's been sometime.

1094
00:40:12,234 --> 00:40:14,578
They say our Rajamani acted in this film,

1095
00:40:14,667 --> 00:40:16,305
- His part would have finished by now?
- No, no it's going to come.

1096
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,174
Come soon.

1097
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,202
In this scene <i>lwill</i> come now.

1098
00:40:23,734 --> 00:40:24,405
Look, look.

1099
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,446
The one driving that auto is our Mani.

1100
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,577
Our actor will come now.

1101
00:40:36,034 --> 00:40:37,479
He will get down now and ask for money.

1102
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,738

00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,041
Look, Rajettan is coming.

1105
00:40:49,467 --> 00:40:50,468

1106
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,273

- Hey Mani.

1107
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,242

1109
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,136
They cheated us.

1110
00:41:02,267 --> 00:41:03,439
They didn't take you?

1111
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:05,110
Theyjust showed like taking you?

1112
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:06,441
No?

1113
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,443
For sure he was there in that auto.

1114
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,170
Because he is dark
couldn't see him properly.

1115
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,270
Dark is yourfather.

1116
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,043
Which rascal is it,

1117
00:41:19,234 --> 00:41:21,043

I will make you act here.

1120
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,280
Don't play the movie in
which our Mani is not there.

1121
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,073
We saw them shooting.

1122
00:41:30,267 --> 00:41:31,109
Stop it.

1123
00:41:31,234 --> 00:41:32,542

1124
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,405
Who is making noise there?

1125
00:41:33,567 --> 00:41:34,341

00:41:41,234 --> 00:41:42,110
It's okay.

1129
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,745
Bis People,

1130
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,340
They started off like this.

1131
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:47,647
I really acted in it father.

1132
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:50,538
Hey Mani I told you right,

1133
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:52,409
Cinema is not for you.

1134
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,238
Instead ofthis if you would have climbed
10 trees you could have made some money.

1135
00:41:56,367 --> 00:41:57,345
Lord, you keep quiet.

1136
00:41:57,534 --> 00:41:58,774
Don't try to defeat him like that.

1137
00:41:59,034 --> 00:42:00,377
Though his acting didn't
make it in this movie.

1138
00:42:00,534 --> 00:42:01,638
He will continue acting.

1139
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,738
Yes, he is my son.

1140
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,736

1141
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,204
He is pretty heavy.

1142
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,736
Nothing to fear.

1143
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,343
Our Mani will faint
if hefeels happy or sad.

1144

1164
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:06,376

00:50:24,567 --> 00:50:26,205
He walks around doing mimicry.

1279
00:50:26,434 --> 00:50:27,970
Don't know what will
happen to him tomorrow.

1280
00:50:28,134 --> 00:50:29,306
He is in cinemas now.

1281
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,501
He has good name too.

1282
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:32,010
Who? He?

1283
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,101
Yes.

1284
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:35,308
How can you live with this?

1285
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,774
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?

1286
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,608
Whatever it is, with his
appearance he won't become Mohanlal.

1287
00:50:41,234 --> 00:50:42,611
But Kumar is police.

1288
00:50:43,034 --> 00:50:44,513
He will be in good position tomorrow.

1289
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:46,109
In our caste.

1290
00:50:46,267 --> 00:50:48,543
A police can become an SP too.

1291
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,245
But your Rajamani.

1292
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,141
How much ever he climbs
he will be on the coconut tree.

1293
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,606
But father.

1294
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,742
Dear, being called as
police's wife is a proud thing.

1295
00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,170
Not just for you.

1296
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,604
For us too.

1297
00:51:00,734 --> 00:51:02,338
If no cinema and drama,

1298
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,707
Rajamani is just a coolie fellow.

1299
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:06,602
You think again.

1300
00:51:06,767 --> 00:51:08,713
Do you want to live as a wife to a police?

1301
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:11,603
Or you want to starve with Rajamani?

1302
00:51:11,733 --> 00:51:12,643
That's it.

1303
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,240
Rest is up to you.

1304
00:51:16,267 --> 00:51:19,043
Dear, think properly.

1305
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:45,710
We dream right,

1306
00:51:46,334 --> 00:51:48,109
Think that it's a dream like that.

1307
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,246
But Manichettan should
come for my marriage okay?

1308
00:51:50,333 --> 00:51:51,539
Start camera.

1309
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:53,613
- Rollin sir.
- Action.

1310
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:06,672
Aadhira, see your groom has come.

1311
00:52:06,767 --> 00:52:08,747
From Bombay.

1312
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:11,245
Cut.

1313
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:12,736
Supen

1314
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:14,345
Switch of the lights.

1315
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:18,973
Is it okay sir?

1316
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,404
If you ask it's okay,

1317
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,305
It's not okay.

1318
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:23,276
What happened?

1319
00:52:23,434 --> 00:52:24,344
Your mood is off.

1320
00:52:24,734 --> 00:52:26,975
Me? Nothing.

1321
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:29,106
I know it.

1322
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,105
You relax let's take afterthe break.

1323
00:52:32,634 --> 00:52:33,612
Break.

1324
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,244
Sir, Captain Raju sir
won't be coming tomorrow.

1325
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,677
Then call that Murali.

1326
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:47,670
Mani.

1327
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,141
Oh.

1328
00:52:51,333 --> 00:52:52,277
No new items with you?

1329
00:52:52,434 --> 00:52:53,378
It's there sir.

1330
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,979
But I have no mood
now I will show you later.

1331
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,773
Show Mani, sir is asking right?

1332
00:52:57,034 --> 00:52:58,411
Let your mood out change.

1333
00:53:00,467 --> 00:53:01,775
I heard about the matter.

1334
00:53:02,633 --> 00:53:04,078
If one girl goes another one.

1335
00:53:05,067 --> 00:53:06,068
Leave it Mani.

1336
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:09,444
After4 films girls will queue behind you.

1337
00:53:13,767 --> 00:53:15,269
- I didn't say anything.
- What?

1338
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:18,341
The girl whom loved
got married to someone else.

1339
00:53:18,534 --> 00:53:19,103
Keep quiet.

1340
00:53:19,234 --> 00:53:21,441
A police fellow married that girl right?

1341
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,674
You told all the story here.

1342
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,235
What was the problem?

1343
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,401
Caste sir.

1344
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,035
Caste m eans,

1345
00:53:28,134 --> 00:53:29,670
We both are of same caste.

1346
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:32,980
But they are the ones who wash
theirfeet with goblet and get inside.

1347
00:53:33,267 --> 00:53:35,543
Upper caste in lower caste.

1348
00:53:35,767 --> 00:53:37,212
Is there a caste for washing feet?

1349
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,576
Leave that, show me something.

1350
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:42,745
/-\ Praying m.

1351
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:44,011
Okay.

1352
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:47,246
Parameshwaran's son,

1353
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:48,345
God Ganapathy.

1354
00:53:48,467 --> 00:53:50,572
You must protect this innocent.

1355
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:52,579
In this town,

1356
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,145
Rat killers are becoming high.

1357
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:55,746
You should save me from them.

1358
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:57,569
My dear God.

1359
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:58,771
Oh cat!

1360
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:02,241
Awesome!

1361
00:54:03,267 --> 00:54:05,076
Sir, there is a new item.

1362
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:06,612
But I am still getting it right.

1363
00:54:07,067 --> 00:54:07,602

Brother, give me that stick.

1366
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:13,068
Move aside.

1367
00:54:22,233 --> 00:54:25,476
Sir, will you help me cross the road?

1368
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:28,412
Sir.

1369
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,407
Oh no one is there.

1370
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,472
How is it sir'?

1371
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:36,035
Here.

1372
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:40,611
Blinds must learn from you.

1373
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,407
Your observation hats off.

1374
00:54:43,634 --> 00:54:45,170
This is what an artist needs.

1375
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:47,708
Some tease saying this is mimicry.

1376
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:49,238
What sir?

1377
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,308
Keeping this character.

1378
00:54:51,734 --> 00:54:52,769
Let's do a movie.

1379
00:54:57,234 --> 00:54:58,076
Really?

1380
00:54:59,467 --> 00:55:02,311
It's an experiment, let me find a subject.

1381
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:05,036
It might reach the Nationals.

1382
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,442
You will be noticed.

1383
00:55:07,334 --> 00:55:08,074
Shall we see?

1384
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,778
Did you hear what Hari sir said?

1385
00:55:14,033 --> 00:55:15,740
Mani's luck,
you are going to become hero tomorrow.

1386
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:17,239
Hey hero.

1387

- He don't know English.
- What's the matter'?

00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,607

When I see your acting I get goose bumps.

Alphonsa loves it.

1430
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:54,212

00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,578
- When one movie finishes it will turn into tears.

That's fine, it's very good.

1545
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:25,408
Girls are very less in Mimicry.

1546

I know it.

1553
01:00:35,267 --> 01:00:36,678
My name is a problem to everyone.

1554
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:37,677
Let the name be anything.

1555
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,576
Just don't get a bad name.

1556
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,237
We both came to act
together in the first film.

1557
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,573
She didn't act.

1558
01:00:43,734 --> 01:00:45,975

Don't call from behind.

1588
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,572
- Did you see this?
- What?

1589
01:02:05,167 --> 01:02:07,477
It's a special spray to attract girls.

1590
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,170
Is there any use of you carrying this?

1591
01:02:11,034 --> 01:02:11,444
Oh!

1592
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:13,401
You could have put some more powder.

1593
01:02:13,534 --> 01:02:14,569
So that he looks even bad.

1594
01:02:14,767 --> 01:02:17,077

1595
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:19,573
Now a day girls like black.

Are you coming?

1597
01:02:24,667 --> 01:02:25,611

01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,444
0h yeah!

1600
01:02:30,267 --> 01:02:32,440
Your complaint was that no girl sees you.

1601
01:02:32,767 --> 01:02:34,075
Go, go!

1602
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:35,307

Come, come and sit.

1607
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:46,207
Come.

1608
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,301
Come Mani, come.

1609
01:02:47,467 --> 01:02:49,140
I didn't expect.

1610
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:50,245
- Greetings.
- He is my father.

1611
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,706
Kanoor Kunappu.

1612
01:02:53,767 --> 01:02:54,973
He is a Tabalist.

1613
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:55,735
She is my mother.

1614
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,010
Greetings.

1615
01:02:57,067 --> 01:02:58,774
She likes Rajamanichettan a lot.

1616
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,202
She loves Rajamanichettafls songs.

1617
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,708
That's why I asked if you can come.

1618
01:03:03,067 --> 01:03:04,774
But I didn't expect you come so soon.

1619
01:03:07,134 --> 01:03:08,010
Rajamani.

1620
01:03:08,167 --> 01:03:09,111
I called you,

1621
01:03:09,234 --> 01:03:11,236
That song which you sang in Kozhikodu.

1622
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,776
"In the tender mango age when I saw you"

1623
01:03:16,134 --> 01:03:17,704
"Let it be a coconut"

1624
01:03:18,034 --> 01:03:19,274
Not coconut, it's Mango!

1625
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,778
- Not mango, mango fruit.
- Whatever.

1626
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:25,172
"Let it be mango fruit"

1627
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:26,540
That day the beat was not proper.

1628
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:27,544
Sing that again.

1629
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,370
He is very good at songs.

1630
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,443
He will find out immediately
if a beat is missed.

1631
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,145
Only if he has a beat
it's all wrong beats.

1632
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:35,177
Sharadha.

1633
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,574
Sing Mani.

1634
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,070
Let me hit the Tabla.

1635
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:39,672
My voice is not good now.

1636
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:40,578
Shall I sing later?

1637
01:03:40,767 --> 01:03:43,077
No, try and see.

1638
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,676
That's tabla's noise.

1639
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,245
He has good beats.

1640
01:03:50,367 --> 01:03:51,539
Itwill be seen in everything.

1641
01:03:52,433 --> 01:03:54,242
But still a wrong beat?

1642
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:55,671
Hey!

1643
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,472
Thief!

1644
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,409

sing in your ears a song ofthe city"

1652
01:04:40,233 --> 01:04:44,443

farm underthe burning sun"

her song in the dreams"

1655
01:05:18,067 --> 01:05:22,982
"A girl working in the
farm underthe burning sun"

1656
01:05:23,167 --> 01:05:27,013

01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:02,681
"Friend from Chalakudi"

1671
01:07:03,434 --> 01:07:07,610
"Friend from Chalakudi"

1672
01:07:08,034 --> 01:07:13,177
"Friend from Chalakudi"

1673
01:07:14,267 --> 01:07:15,405
Oh mother.

1674
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,078
- Come here.
- Don't beat me sir.

1675
01:07:18,267 --> 01:07:19,109
Won't you listen?

1676
01:07:19,234 --> 01:07:20,542
I will die sir don't hit me.

1677
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:22,344
Move aside.

1678
01:07:22,567 --> 01:07:23,432
What mistake did he do?

1679
01:07:23,433 --> 01:07:24,173
No sir.

1680
01:07:24,267 --> 01:07:26,110
Because he is dark?
Or because he is born colorless?

1681
01:07:26,234 --> 01:07:27,577
They have given expenses
for colorless sir.

1682
01:07:27,634 --> 01:07:28,408
In terms of beatings?

1683
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:29,035
No sir.

1684
01:07:29,134 --> 01:07:31,114
First learn to see human as human.

1685
01:07:31,234 --> 01:07:31,974
Cut it.

1686
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,979
<i>Ok Eepachaaya it was good.</i>

1687
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,135
I know it will be good.

1688
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:36,410
Yes Jose.

1689
01:07:36,500 --> 01:07:37,478
Greetings.

1690
01:07:37,767 --> 01:07:38,973
Why haven't you gone yet?

1691
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:40,738
If you say now how is it sir?

1692
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:43,076
Now or then every time
I have only one thing to say.

1693
01:07:43,167 --> 01:07:44,373
I won't act.

1694
01:07:44,534 --> 01:07:46,172
- You got backthe check right?
- Yes I got.

1695
01:07:46,334 --> 01:07:47,369
Then leave.

1696
01:07:47,467 --> 01:07:51,176
After taking advance when the
movie is about to start if you say no.

1697
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,075
Whatwill Ido now sir'?

1698
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:56,046
You go and tell the director,

1699
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:58,603
I don't like to act
with such kind of people.

1700
01:07:59,067 --> 01:07:59,511
To act?

1701
01:07:59,634 --> 01:08:01,204
You don't like.

1702
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:02,711
Then leave, leave.

1703
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:08,107
Hey Jose, come here.

1704
01:08:08,267 --> 01:08:09,007
Yes.

1705
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:12,539
Sir, work is over I am leaving.

1706
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,145
I have a small play.

1707
01:08:14,267 --> 01:08:15,337
Yes sir.

1708
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:18,344
Don't say that I spoiled even
more when you started the movie.

1709
01:08:18,567 --> 01:08:19,568
Dates are a problem for her.

1710
01:08:19,733 --> 01:08:21,406
Examination, examination.

1711
01:08:21,567 --> 01:08:23,046
Give him backthe advance.

1712
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,207
Oh I haven't take it yet.

1713
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,404
Then no problem.

1714
01:08:28,267 --> 01:08:29,610
Kavitha has got exams.

1715
01:08:29,734 --> 01:08:31,475
No date, no date understood?

1716
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:34,043
Then leave go.

1717
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,201
Okay.

1718
01:08:35,567 --> 01:08:36,409
Okay then.

1719
01:08:37,067 --> 01:08:39,013
Why do you have to leave the
money that you were about to get?

1720
01:08:39,134 --> 01:08:40,340
You will not always get.

1721
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:42,542
Ifthis money becomes our last money?

1722
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:44,136
If we don't get any more cinemas?

1723
01:08:44,267 --> 01:08:45,575
Oh that's also true.

1724
01:08:46,067 --> 01:08:48,570
It's them whom make us
get and not to get cinemas.

1725
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,575
Come.

1726
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,237
You don't take tension its normal.

1727
01:08:52,334 --> 01:08:53,642
If it's like this then how sir?

1728
01:08:53,767 --> 01:08:55,178
Will the movie work?

1729
01:08:55,367 --> 01:08:56,437
Everything will work.

1730
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,338
We will do it even
if no one acts in it.

1731
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,977
This is a test.

1732
01:09:00,134 --> 01:09:01,340
There is nothing which
won't happen if we try hard.

1733
01:09:01,434 --> 01:09:02,310
But still.

1734
01:09:02,434 --> 01:09:03,412
No buts.

1735
01:09:03,767 --> 01:09:04,973
You be strong.

1736
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:07,111
At the beginning few
hits by stones are for good.

1737
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:19,010
Always hitting it,

1738
01:09:19,267 --> 01:09:20,109
What's the use?

1739
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:24,008
Morning only he has started.

1740
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:25,204
I am scared even thinking about it.

1741
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,973
- Don't think.
- Then come.

1742
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,406
Oh look who has come, see here.

1743
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:33,237
Rajamani, come sit.

1744
01:09:33,334 --> 01:09:35,007
- Let's sit.
- Come sit.

1745
01:09:35,234 --> 01:09:36,611
Everyone is there.

1746
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,108
You knew the way?

1747
01:09:38,234 --> 01:09:39,212
That's good.

1748
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,213
Who don't know Kanoor Kunaapu?

1749
01:09:42,267 --> 01:09:43,610
Then this Tabala's music.

1750
01:09:43,734 --> 01:09:45,008
Can we forget that easily?

1751
01:09:45,134 --> 01:09:46,442
Sharadha, make some tea.

1752
01:09:46,534 --> 01:09:49,572
Hands are not swift like
before to beat the tabala.

1753
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:51,078
For you guys I can try.

1754
01:09:51,267 --> 01:09:52,507
Oh no.

1755
01:09:53,134 --> 01:09:54,169
We don't need it now.

1756
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,746
We can do it anytime.

1757
01:10:00,201 --> 01:10:01,544
I had been to tailor shop.

1758
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,212
But saw your vehicle
on the way so I came back.

1759
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,601
Come here dear.

1760
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:06,774
I will be back.

1761
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,443
Did you guys come here to meet me?

1762
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:09,476
Yes, Yes.

1763
01:10:10,067 --> 01:10:13,446
No we were on the way
to Kozhikodu and came here.

1764
01:10:13,567 --> 01:10:16,571
But from Chaalakudi to Kozhikodu
on the way through Kanoor.

1765
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:17,508
How is that?

1766
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,671
If we miss the way
we can come like this too.

1767
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:21,678
Oh like that okay.

1768
01:10:23,267 --> 01:10:26,043
Daughtertold there
are many more help programs.

1769
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:26,578
Yes.

1770
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,737
Next month we have a
little more stage program.

1771
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:32,240
To be true only after
she came with Mani,

1772
01:10:32,334 --> 01:10:33,472
This house is going green.

1773
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,601
Is this the green?

1774
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:36,304
Thank you so much.

1775
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:38,236
There is no need ofthanks.

1776
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:39,742
We all are going to become one right?

1777
01:10:40,501 --> 01:10:41,377
How?

1778
01:10:41,467 --> 01:10:43,447
Without beating around the
bush I will tell you the matter.

1779
01:10:43,534 --> 01:10:46,242
Mani would like to marry Mrinalini.

1780
01:10:47,267 --> 01:10:48,644
- I like.
- Rajamani.

1781
01:10:49,234 --> 01:10:51,043
Don't take me wrong.

1782
01:10:51,134 --> 01:10:52,613
You are help to us now.

1783
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,972
We will never forget that.

1784
01:10:54,134 --> 01:10:55,579
But when we speak.

1785
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:58,407
We are from Aromalcha's generation.

1786
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,275
We are very known Chekavans.

1787
01:11:00,767 --> 01:11:02,110
Then how is this possible?

1788
01:11:02,267 --> 01:11:04,008
You guys think and see.

1789
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:06,169
From such low caste.

1790
01:11:06,434 --> 01:11:08,141
Let the Aromal be there.

1791
01:11:08,434 --> 01:11:09,469
When they both like
each other so much.

1792
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,738
There is nothing between them.

1793
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:13,239
Colleges will talk
and mingle with each other.

1794
01:11:13,334 --> 01:11:15,177
- There is nothing more than that.
- Get up Mani.

1795
01:11:15,467 --> 01:11:16,207
Leave it and come.

1796
01:11:16,367 --> 01:11:18,438
- Okay then Lord, shall we leave?
- Let's leave.

1797
01:11:18,567 --> 01:11:21,605
One who don't have money to have a
hair cut is talking about generations.

1798
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:41,509
Today is Karkada month's no mood day.

1799
01:11:42,467 --> 01:11:43,775
You don't take tension Mohan.

1800
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:46,170
Life which is com pletely
covered in darkness.

1801
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,745
This is the story of Ramu right?

1802
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,439
Let's start it on the
no mood day itself and test.

1803
01:11:50,567 --> 01:11:52,740
Ifour Rajamani act
and make it awesome,

1804
01:11:53,067 --> 01:11:55,013
This movie will be
a super hit for sure.

1805
01:11:55,434 --> 01:11:56,174
Yusef sir,

1806
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,746
In this movie camera
will work it's best,

1807
01:11:59,001 --> 01:12:00,002
I guarantee you that.

1808
01:12:00,301 --> 01:12:01,644
Superb location.

1809
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,080
Rest is in Mani's hand.

1810
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:06,712
Iget scared by looking
at the risk that Hari sir takes.

1811
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:10,348
Since he casted me there
is no one else who is ready to act.

1812
01:12:10,501 --> 01:12:11,502
You keep quiet.

1813
01:12:12,367 --> 01:12:15,109
There are many people with
good heart in Malayalam cinema.

1814
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,671
Let's see.

1815
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,416
"Lord Krishna, when I hear yourtune"

1816
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:26,605
"A song wakes up in my heart"

1817
01:13:38,734 --> 01:13:41,044
H 6V-

1818
01:13:46,767 --> 01:13:49,475
Nobody expected this kind
of success with no artist.

1819
01:13:49,734 --> 01:13:50,576

1820
01:13:51,201 --> 01:13:53,010

more movies with you.

Thank you so much sir.

1830
01:14:08,334 --> 01:14:10,109
Actually I have to thank you.

1831
01:14:10,467 --> 01:14:12,037
You did morethan I expected.

1832
01:14:12,734 --> 01:14:16,079
Sir, everyone is saying
we must send this movie for award.

1833
01:14:16,201 --> 01:14:17,145
Let's see.

1834
01:14:17,434 --> 01:14:20,074
But is there any use if
we send this movie for award?

1835
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:20,710
What?

1836
01:14:25,267 --> 01:14:26,575
"Even I have"

1837
01:14:27,067 --> 01:14:30,310
"Even I have,
a wife like this at home"

1838
01:14:30,434 --> 01:14:33,574
"Birds are nothing
compared to her beauty"

1839
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:35,575
"Wife as beautiful as gold"

1840
01:14:36,067 --> 01:14:37,705
Is this still not written?

1841
01:14:38,067 --> 01:14:39,273
It's not announced yet.

1842
01:14:39,467 --> 01:14:40,411
It will be very soon.

1843
01:14:40,467 --> 01:14:41,571
This is completely wrong.

1844
01:14:41,801 --> 01:14:43,041
Keep it there.

1845
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:46,047
Hey Sukhu look,

1846
01:14:46,267 --> 01:14:47,678
Hey, hey. hey-

1847
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,445
You have been to school right?

1848
01:14:49,567 --> 01:14:50,671
It's not black.

1849
01:14:51,134 --> 01:14:52,545
It's the R from Rum.

1850
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:53,405
Write it properly.

1851
01:14:53,467 --> 01:14:55,037
Don'tjust fool people

1852
01:14:55,134 --> 01:14:56,511
Its Ru ant's Ru.

1853
01:14:56,767 --> 01:14:58,246
Will you decide that?

1854
01:14:58,434 --> 01:14:59,276
<i>Iwill</i> show you.

1855
01:14:59,534 --> 01:15:00,205
Sukhu.

1856
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:01,142
Sukhu you write it correctly.

1857
01:15:01,267 --> 01:15:02,769
It's Ru, Ru.

1858
01:15:03,034 --> 01:15:04,012
Don't write like that.

1859
01:15:04,267 --> 01:15:05,712
When we say it's
like that right? Black.

1860
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:07,040
Erase the below one.

1861
01:15:07,234 --> 01:15:08,577
Now it's correct.

1862
01:15:09,067 --> 01:15:11,069
Sukhu do you put a Iinefor Rum's Ra?

1863
01:15:11,234 --> 01:15:12,406
Hey what is this?

1864
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:13,775
Today's fish is from me.

1865
01:15:14,034 --> 01:15:14,512
Let it be so.

1866
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:16,237
Which fools have written this?

1867
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,774
They have only not gone to school.

1868
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:19,238
You have gone until 5th right?

1869
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:20,678
It's Kurupu's Ru.

1870
01:15:21,034 --> 01:15:22,741
Karutha Muthu this is the right one.

1871
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,477

Rum's Ra that's correct write it.

1874
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,211
Is this how you write Rum's Ra?

1875
01:15:29,267 --> 01:15:31,747
Your mother's head I cannot do this.

1876
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:32,740
Hey, hey.

1877
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:34,240

- Write it.
- Come, come.

1880
01:15:36,801 --> 01:15:38,576
You finish writing this and then go.

1881
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,076
Kurupu Ru Karutha Muthu.

1882
01:15:41,134 --> 01:15:46,140

"Birds are nothing
compared to her beauty"

01:15:59,500 --> 01:16:00,774
Scotch, scotch.

1889
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,241
Or a good toddy.

1890
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,310
Both are ready.

1891
01:16:04,434 --> 01:16:06,311
Is it decided?

1892
01:16:06,467 --> 01:16:08,071
What is there to decide?

1893
01:16:08,267 --> 01:16:12,443

Take it.

1895

We are poor people.

1900
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:29,672
If we are getting award,

1901
01:16:29,767 --> 01:16:31,474

They all are coming here.

1905
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:40,037
- You should take care of it okay.
- Don't worry I will manage.

1906

You have to come in TV and newspaper.

1908
01:16:44,334 --> 01:16:46,712

01:16:51,767 --> 01:16:54,407
Today's expense will
add up to 3 to 4 Iakhs.

1913
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:57,571
Award means acceptance
money is not important.

1916
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,179
- My wife has got color sense.
- No, I don't believe that.

1917
01:17:05,367 --> 01:17:07,244
- Why?
- If so she wouldn't have married you.

1918
01:17:09,767 --> 01:17:11,246
Hello, what happened sir?

1919
01:17:12,434 --> 01:17:14,414

From Delhi, they kind of decided.

1921
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:18,639
They decided?

1922
01:17:18,767 --> 01:17:19,745

One says Rum's Ra another says ants
Ru, they don't go to study as well.

1928
01:17:34,467 --> 01:17:36,310
Who told you to write like this?

1929
01:17:36,701 --> 01:17:38,544

Ramappa,

1932
01:17:44,567 --> 01:17:45,568
Your fathefs Ra.

1933
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:47,613
There is no Ra for father, Ramappa.

1934
01:17:48,034 --> 01:17:50,105
Who told you write about
my son as Black pearl?

1935
01:17:50,267 --> 01:17:51,245
He is not black?

1936
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,379
Black? Write it as white pearl.

1937
01:17:54,434 --> 01:17:56,277
I am paying you right? Write it.

1938
01:17:56,534 --> 01:17:58,070
My Goddess.

1939
01:17:58,267 --> 01:18:00,110
Iwish Rajamani won't get an award.

1940
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:01,375
What?

1941
01:18:01,634 --> 01:18:02,510
Write it.

1942
01:18:03,801 --> 01:18:05,007
Write it.

1943
01:18:05,134 --> 01:18:06,442
What should I write now?

1944
01:18:06,567 --> 01:18:09,173
Your grandmother's grandfather.

1945
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,704
Black?

1946
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,043
Shall I write here as white?

1947
01:18:16,234 --> 01:18:16,735
Who?

1948
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:18,446
Hari Sir.

1949
01:18:20,734 --> 01:18:22,372
Hello, is Hari sir there?

1950
01:18:22,601 --> 01:18:23,409
He is here.

1951
01:18:23,567 --> 01:18:26,343
Gopi, let's go from
down to up that's the frame.

1952
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,538
Sir, Rajamani.

1953
01:18:29,467 --> 01:18:30,468
Plan there.

1954
01:18:30,667 --> 01:18:31,202
What?

1955
01:18:31,267 --> 01:18:33,076
- Did you hear?
- What's the matter'?

1956
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,438
We are getting the award.

1957
01:18:35,534 --> 01:18:37,036
I heard.

1958
01:18:37,101 --> 01:18:38,739
Don't say it to anyone
let them announce first.

1959
01:18:39,034 --> 01:18:41,071
Nair sir had called from Delhi.

1960
01:18:41,167 --> 01:18:41,770
Oh then?

1961
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:44,080
It's kind of decided he said.

1962
01:18:44,234 --> 01:18:46,646
This national award is not that easy.

1963
01:18:47,101 --> 01:18:48,671
Especially for people like us.

1964
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,206
For mimicry remember once
they rejected state award.

1965
01:18:52,767 --> 01:18:53,745
Don't forget that.

1966
01:18:54,267 --> 01:18:56,645
Sir, we started the celebrations here.

1967
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:58,143
Will you come sir?

1968
01:18:58,401 --> 01:18:59,436
I am here in Madras.

1969
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,510
Oh okay.

1970
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:01,736
Okay sir.

1971
01:19:05,567 --> 01:19:07,444
Remove it soon if
not it will over cook.

1972
01:19:12,067 --> 01:19:13,102
Will this burst correctly?

1973
01:19:13,234 --> 01:19:14,474
When the news comes in
TV immediately it has to burst.

1974
01:19:14,601 --> 01:19:17,172
Move aside and stand if not I will
keep it in yourthroat and burst it.

1975
01:19:17,434 --> 01:19:18,003
Listen.

1976

I am sukhu who taught Rajamani

1977
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,738
If you play with me you will know.

1978
01:19:29,067 --> 01:19:30,239
Did they show in TV?

1979
01:19:30,601 --> 01:19:31,306
What is this?

1980
01:19:31,434 --> 01:19:32,242
What is this?

1981
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:33,142
What?

1982
01:19:34,034 --> 01:19:35,104
I just tested the crackers.

1983
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,178
On your face?

1984
01:19:36,401 --> 01:19:37,573
Do you need this much of celebration?

1985
01:19:37,634 --> 01:19:39,272
- We need.
- Brother you don't fear.

1986
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:40,277
We will nail it.

1987
01:19:40,467 --> 01:19:41,377
Not just Chaalakudi.

1988
01:19:41,634 --> 01:19:42,738
The entire Kerala will be stunned.

1989
01:19:43,367 --> 01:19:45,040
Yes they will be stunned.

1990
01:19:45,200 --> 01:19:47,237
Saying the acting was not good,
state award was rejected.

1991
01:19:47,334 --> 01:19:49,143

They aretrying to make us fail.

Nothing to worry if he feels
happy or sad our Mani is like this.

2028
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,175
He will faint and fail
sometimes loose conscious.

2029
01:21:51,567 --> 01:21:54,571
How bad it is to become run
outwhen you are bating really well.

2030
01:21:54,767 --> 01:21:56,269
Because of your own mistake,

2031
01:21:56,467 --> 01:21:58,743
Or it could be because
of your partner's mistake.

2032
01:22:01,467 --> 01:22:02,673
Tobacco will harm you.

2033
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:03,978
When you smoke,

2034
01:22:04,100 --> 01:22:06,046
The ones around you
are also getting smoked.

2035
01:22:07,034 --> 01:22:09,071
Be smart, keep aside the tobacco.

2036
01:22:09,267 --> 01:22:10,507
Don't be run out!

2037
01:22:17,334 --> 01:22:20,281
"L told you before also Kunjanjo"

2038
01:22:20,434 --> 01:22:24,246
"Don't marry a beautiful girl"

2039
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:28,241
"By marrying a beautiful girl"

2040
01:22:28,434 --> 01:22:31,278
"Life is gone even my beauty too"

2041
01:22:31,467 --> 01:22:33,572
No big deal saying 15 acres.

2042
01:22:33,734 --> 01:22:34,974
There is no value
for agriculture land now.

2043
01:22:35,267 --> 01:22:36,302
Forthe value that you said,

2044
01:22:36,434 --> 01:22:37,640
Don't think about this deal.

2045
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:38,710
I have no other choice.

2046
01:22:39,201 --> 01:22:40,111
As a help?

2047
01:22:40,667 --> 01:22:42,669
We both have done lot
of business together right?

2048
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,308
If you add the money
and interesfs you have taken.

2049
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,979
Do you know how many Iakhs it's been?

2050
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:47,010
Then the bank loan too?

2051
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:48,473
No, no it won't work.

2052
01:22:48,601 --> 01:22:49,705
Daughter's marriage.

2053
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:51,171
If this is not happening?

2054
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:52,468
Am I not making it happen?

2055
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,279
No, I didn't mean that.

2056
01:22:54,567 --> 01:22:57,548
It's all happened because of
the love towards land and agriculture.

2057
01:22:58,134 --> 01:23:00,011
Please don't leave
my hand in this situation.

2058
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,370
What shall I do brother?

2059
01:23:02,467 --> 01:23:04,276
Bank guys will confiscate this land.

2060
01:23:04,567 --> 01:23:07,377
Looking at the account with
this amount it's not possible.

2061
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,408
This land and house also will go.

2062
01:23:09,734 --> 01:23:12,010
So, I will paythe bank loan.

2063
01:23:12,367 --> 01:23:14,108
The 32 Iakh that you have to give me.

2064
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:16,337
I will forget about that,
isn't that enough?

2065
01:23:17,467 --> 01:23:18,275
Don't cheat me.

2066
01:23:18,667 --> 01:23:21,011
At least 10 Iakh for
my daughter's marriage.

2067
01:23:22,167 --> 01:23:23,339
This is the third alliance.

2068
01:23:23,734 --> 01:23:25,008
If this too won't happen.

2069
01:23:25,301 --> 01:23:26,245
I will have to commit suicide.

2070
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,674
If an agriculture guy commit suicide,

2071
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,070
Loan will be taken off by the government.

2072
01:23:30,234 --> 01:23:33,078
This confiscate and warnings
are only forthe ones who are alive.

2073
01:23:33,534 --> 01:23:36,242
Your daughtefs marriage also
will happen and your loans also will end.

2074
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:43,635
Get down.

2075
01:23:50,334 --> 01:23:51,540
What is this Lord?

After everything <i>lwill</i>
give 2 Iakh rupee if you want.

2078
01:23:56,134 --> 01:23:56,737
No need.

2079
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,636
When you stretch your
hand to other peoples,

2080
01:23:59,767 --> 01:24:01,542
You neverthought of me Lord?

2081

01:24:04,434 --> 01:24:05,242
Didn't you see?

2083
01:24:06,467 --> 01:24:08,310

It's all the play
ofthe one sitting above.

2089
01:24:21,234 --> 01:24:22,577
We can't stop that.

2090

Yours and your father's
sweat has fallen on this land.

2097
01:24:40,067 --> 01:24:42,377
I am happy that it's coming to your hands.

2098
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,170

2100
01:24:45,334 --> 01:24:46,745
Not toddy like before,

2101
01:24:46,801 --> 01:24:48,337
Scotch, its scotch.

2102
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,313
Let Superstar Rajkumar live long.

2103
01:25:12,267 --> 01:25:15,339
Let poor people's Superstar
Rajkumar live long.

2104
01:25:15,734 --> 01:25:18,578
Let Superstar Rajkumar live long.

2105
01:25:19,334 --> 01:25:21,974
You can cheat only if he lives long.

2106
01:25:22,267 --> 01:25:23,712
Why is there a color change in this milk?

2107
01:25:24,034 --> 01:25:25,342
Is it diabetic cow's milk?

2108
01:25:26,134 --> 01:25:28,740
Yes, a little cow's urine is
also mixed shall I pour it on your head?

2109
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:32,172
No need, I will become superstar then.

01:26:02,534 --> 01:26:03,672
What's the problem here?

2121
01:26:03,801 --> 01:26:05,974
Hey go, Rajkumar is not a matter to me.

2122
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,238

01:26:20,434 --> 01:26:21,538
Money for milk.

- Yes, 100.

2131
01:26:24,301 --> 01:26:26,247
Rajkumar sir's this
huge body has to get wet.

2132
01:26:26,434 --> 01:26:27,435
So much of milk is needed.

2133
01:26:27,567 --> 01:26:29,240
You mix 90 litre of
water in 10 litre milk.

2134
01:26:29,367 --> 01:26:30,539
That's your kind of work.

2135
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:32,507
Rajkumar sir is like my father.

2136
01:26:32,667 --> 01:26:34,169
Will I mix water in his milk?

2137
01:26:34,301 --> 01:26:36,713

2138
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:39,569
Hey Shashianna,

"Clap your hands girl,

2153
01:27:24,367 --> 01:27:26,404

Send them away.

2163
01:27:41,267 --> 01:27:43,247
What will Itell him now?

2164
01:27:43,434 --> 01:27:45,038
It's been an hour since it started.

2165
01:27:46,067 --> 01:27:47,546
His phone call.

2166
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:55,179
When shoot is in break like
this only I can eat peacefully.

2167
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:56,370
- Go and get some sweets for me.
- Okay sir.

2168
01:27:59,234 --> 01:28:01,407
Get one milk shake as well.

2169
01:28:01,634 --> 01:28:02,271
Add some badam too.

2170
01:28:02,434 --> 01:28:03,105
Okay sir.

2171
01:28:03,234 --> 01:28:05,578
How long it's been getting so irritated.

2172
01:28:05,734 --> 01:28:06,576
How bad it is.

2173
01:28:06,701 --> 01:28:07,406
Sir.

2174
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,408
Sir.

2175
01:28:08,567 --> 01:28:09,204
When will it start?

2176
01:28:09,334 --> 01:28:10,574
- What?
- I have to use the bathroom.

2177
01:28:10,767 --> 01:28:11,507
Should Itake you?

2178
01:28:11,601 --> 01:28:13,581
If I won't remove this,
should I do it in this sack?

2179
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,244
- Hey, come here.
- Yes sir.

2180
01:28:15,434 --> 01:28:16,412
Keep this vada with a hole there,

2181
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,578
- And make a hole here.
- Brother

2182
01:28:18,734 --> 01:28:20,145
Sir.

2183
01:28:20,434 --> 01:28:21,708
- Bring that Vada here.
- Okay sir.

2184
01:28:21,801 --> 01:28:24,714
Though shooting won't happen,
eating will definitely happen.

2185
01:28:25,034 --> 01:28:26,274
See the way he is eating.

2186
01:28:27,134 --> 01:28:28,374
Move the reflector from there.

2187
01:28:28,534 --> 01:28:31,174
I told you to be careful
when I heard the subject.

2188
01:28:32,434 --> 01:28:33,037
It fell?

2189
01:28:33,234 --> 01:28:34,212
Okay, okay.

2190
01:28:35,367 --> 01:28:36,175
Sir.

2191
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,104
Towards Malabar and Kozhikodu.

2192
01:28:38,267 --> 01:28:39,678
Film is gone, it's flop.

2193
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:40,972
Thiruvanthapuram?

2194
01:28:41,201 --> 01:28:43,772
Good scream at Thiruvanthapuram,
no one is there for next show.

2195
01:28:44,034 --> 01:28:45,513
Then should we keep him and take anymore?

2196
01:28:45,767 --> 01:28:46,404
Paalakad is also gone.

2197
01:28:46,567 --> 01:28:47,409
I knew it.

2198
01:28:47,534 --> 01:28:49,571
18th and 19th no work for Shiji okay.

2199
01:28:50,001 --> 01:28:51,241
But I have booked the room
come the previous day itself.

2200
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,175
What happened to that Vavachan sir?

2201
01:28:53,267 --> 01:28:56,771
He is sitting, standing, walking again
sitting, standing, walking what is it?

2202
01:28:57,034 --> 01:28:57,774
It could be piles.

2203
01:28:58,101 --> 01:28:58,977
Piles?

2204
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,579
Will it go if he walks like this?

2205
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:02,645
Anyway no work is happening here,
I will go for a walk and come.

2206
01:29:02,767 --> 01:29:04,007
Will this digest?

2207
01:29:04,267 --> 01:29:05,109
What is this?

2208
01:29:05,334 --> 01:29:08,110
What is happening shouldn't
the shooting start?

2209
01:29:08,234 --> 01:29:10,737
Without knowing the released movie's
result he won't act that's his way.

2210
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,106
Ifthis movie is going like this I will
have to sell my house in San Fransisco.

2211
01:29:14,334 --> 01:29:15,608
You must do something.

2212
01:29:16,234 --> 01:29:17,110
Sir, here.

2213
01:29:17,434 --> 01:29:19,345
Cinema's shooting is like this.

2214
01:29:19,434 --> 01:29:21,141
He is in the tension
of the new movie released.

2215
01:29:21,334 --> 01:29:22,779
Withoutthat ending I don't
think shooting will start.

2216
01:29:23,134 --> 01:29:25,045
How much will you get if
you sell the house in San Fransisco?

2217
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,979
Fool, Itold him no
need of this huge set up.

2218
01:29:28,100 --> 01:29:28,737
If you ask so,

2219
01:29:29,067 --> 01:29:31,513
Is it enough only if I think,
only if he too thinks we can do something.

2220
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:32,977
You go and call that Rajan.

2221
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:34,239
- Which Rajan?
- Rajkumar.

2222
01:29:34,434 --> 01:29:36,380
Don't call so, he is an angry man.

2223
01:29:36,467 --> 01:29:39,209
Ifwe all go and fall
on his leg maybe itwill work.

2224
01:29:39,301 --> 01:29:40,712
Ifwe fall it will work I am sure, come.

2225
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:42,109
Should you fall from here itself?

2226
01:29:42,234 --> 01:29:43,212
Nothing happened, come.

2227
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,740
- Smile, smile.
- For what?

2228
01:29:47,201 --> 01:29:50,080
Looking at our expressions he
should feel that the movie is superhit.

2229
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:51,272
- Yes, yes.
- Go.

2230
01:29:51,467 --> 01:29:52,207
Go and meet.

2231
01:29:52,301 --> 01:29:54,076
Go soon.

2232
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,740
I said go.

2233
01:29:56,067 --> 01:29:57,478
- What?
- Congratulations sir.

2234
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,636
Kozhikodu and kanoor it is house full.

2235
01:30:00,201 --> 01:30:02,044
In Tiruvanthapuram,

2236
01:30:02,101 --> 01:30:03,409
Because of clap sounds they
can't hear the dialogues properly.

2237
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:06,037
Super hit, we can start the shooting.

2238
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:08,308
Yes, my friend just called me.

2239
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:09,310
Do you know what he said?

2240
01:30:09,434 --> 01:30:10,310
Not any time near,

2241
01:30:10,434 --> 01:30:11,742
They haven't seen a movie like this.

2242
01:30:12,101 --> 01:30:13,011
Good movie.

2243
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,602
Even family loved it a lot.

2244
01:30:14,734 --> 01:30:16,736
There are many to defeat us by screaming.

2245
01:30:17,067 --> 01:30:17,704
Fools.

2246
01:30:18,467 --> 01:30:20,344
Let's start the shooting then come.

2247
01:30:20,634 --> 01:30:21,578
Lal sir is very happy.

2248
01:30:21,734 --> 01:30:24,078
Yes, he is happy that's why
I said let's start the shooting.

2249
01:30:24,267 --> 01:30:24,972
Set it up.

2250
01:30:25,101 --> 01:30:26,011
Track or crane?

2251
01:30:26,100 --> 01:30:27,078
- Crane, crane.
- Direct it.

2252
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,474
Crane up.

2253
01:30:29,767 --> 01:30:31,405
Sifs person has come
to give you the good news.

2254
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:32,510
His smile says it all.

2255
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:33,737
Kochi is also okay.

2256
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:35,570
Sir, movie is super hit.

2257
01:30:36,234 --> 01:30:37,235
Movie is super hit.

2258
01:30:37,334 --> 01:30:39,075
- We got to know.
- So let's start the shooting.

2259
01:30:39,267 --> 01:30:42,305
So many junior artists are there, if we
do the shoot today expenses will be less.

2260
01:30:42,534 --> 01:30:44,639
Calm down Vavacha, does he knows
the tension of a movie becoming super hit?

2261
01:30:45,734 --> 01:30:46,974
Hejust have to spend the money.

2262
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:48,637
True I don't know anything, direct it.

2263
01:30:48,801 --> 01:30:50,212
Let's do it after lunch.

2264
01:30:50,467 --> 01:30:51,070
Who is that?

2265
01:30:51,234 --> 01:30:53,544
I forgot about it, Veerali came.

2266
01:30:53,767 --> 01:30:55,144
A small interview 10 minutes.

2267
01:30:55,334 --> 01:30:56,404
I will be ready soon.

2268
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:58,307
Go and arrange forthe shooting
instead of standing still.

2269
01:30:58,434 --> 01:30:59,538
Everything is ready.

2270
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:01,044
- You come sir.
- Zoom the camera.

2271
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:02,168
Didn't you see? Movie is hit.

2272
01:31:02,434 --> 01:31:04,414
Not just hit its super hit.

2273
01:31:05,034 --> 01:31:05,637
- Sit.
- Thank you.

2274
01:31:05,734 --> 01:31:06,769
Veerali.

2275
01:31:07,434 --> 01:31:08,970
He sat, don't bother about it today then.

2276
01:31:09,067 --> 01:31:10,478
Radhamani shoot will get over soon today.

2277
01:31:10,667 --> 01:31:12,305
Last two movies was not a super hit.

2278
01:31:12,600 --> 01:31:13,977
That was directofs problem.

2279
01:31:14,267 --> 01:31:16,008
But what all did you write?

2280
01:31:16,134 --> 01:31:17,044
What do you say now?

2281
01:31:17,634 --> 01:31:18,704
The same.

2282
01:31:19,134 --> 01:31:20,545
- No change.
- What do you mean?

2283
01:31:21,067 --> 01:31:22,569
Bad opinion than before.

2284
01:31:23,734 --> 01:31:26,010
You will say so but
this is not a normal movie.

2285
01:31:26,167 --> 01:31:27,407
A proper entertainer.

2286
01:31:28,034 --> 01:31:28,705
Sir.

2287
01:31:29,167 --> 01:31:30,441
I saw the movie and came.

2288
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,511
How many people for your movie?

2289
01:31:33,567 --> 01:31:34,238
Shashi.

2290
01:31:34,534 --> 01:31:35,035
How many people?

2291
01:31:35,134 --> 01:31:36,272
That i5.

2292
01:31:37,167 --> 01:31:39,272
Maybe 25 to 50 that's it.

2293
01:31:40,001 --> 01:31:40,775
Okay then crane down.

2294
01:31:41,067 --> 01:31:42,239
The only 500 fans that you had,

2295
01:31:42,367 --> 01:31:44,074
You sent to the other movie to scream.

2296
01:31:44,767 --> 01:31:45,973
What I said istrue right Shashi?

2297
01:31:47,367 --> 01:31:47,708
Is it true?

2298
01:31:48,667 --> 01:31:49,668
Tell him Shashi.

2299
01:31:51,067 --> 01:31:54,674
It's not enough if you just listen to the boasting
from the people standing around you sir.

2300
01:31:55,034 --> 01:31:56,012
Time has changed.

2301
01:31:56,201 --> 01:31:59,512
A movie with no super
star is running super hit.

2302
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:00,974
What I had digested.

2303
01:32:04,267 --> 01:32:05,245
He is going.

2304
01:32:05,700 --> 01:32:06,735
Why are you looking at me?

2305
01:32:08,767 --> 01:32:10,747
Hey Eerali, can you get up?

2306
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:14,738
Who went?

2307
01:32:15,001 --> 01:32:16,071
- Sir went.
- What?

2308
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,305
Why did you come here?

2309
01:32:18,434 --> 01:32:19,344
You are not Eerali.

2310
01:32:20,101 --> 01:32:20,670
Veerali.

2311
01:32:21,201 --> 01:32:22,646
Jesus, <i>lwill</i> kill everyone.

2312
01:32:22,767 --> 01:32:24,246
Is it over? Okay pack up.

2313
01:32:33,101 --> 01:32:33,545
Show that.

2314
01:32:33,734 --> 01:32:34,439

2316
01:32:36,534 --> 01:32:37,035
Yes.

2317
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:38,744
This is nice.

2318
01:32:39,101 --> 01:32:40,273
How is this one?

2319
01:32:41,201 --> 01:32:41,736
Oh!

2320
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,274
- See this one sir.
- Hey Manichetta?

2321
01:32:44,067 --> 01:32:45,307
I saw Karimaadi.

2322
01:32:45,767 --> 01:32:46,643
It's superb.

2323
01:32:46,767 --> 01:32:47,973
- Thanks.
- Okay.

2324
01:32:49,101 --> 01:32:49,738
Jose.

2325
01:32:49,801 --> 01:32:51,712
Will this color look good on Raju?

2326
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:54,373
Buying shirts for everyone because the movie
is super hit I am seeing it for the first time.

2327
01:32:54,634 --> 01:32:56,511
- Me too.
- That's Mani.

2328
01:32:57,234 --> 01:32:57,712

01:32:57,800 --> 01:32:58,778
For sister's kids.

2330
01:32:59,234 --> 01:33:00,338
There are neighbors kids too.

2331
01:33:00,534 --> 01:33:01,376
Girl.

2332
01:33:01,534 --> 01:33:02,205
What's your name?

2333
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:03,210
- Who are you to Manichettan?
- Friend.

2334
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:03,778
Notjust friend.

2335
01:33:04,101 --> 01:33:06,342
We are togetherfrom childhood.

2336
01:33:06,467 --> 01:33:07,571
- Me too.
- Though body is different color is the same.

2337

2394
01:35:31,501 --> 01:35:33,003
I have come from Madurai.

01:35:33,201 --> 01:35:35,306
My name is Maanikya Chetiyaar.

2396
01:35:36,534 --> 01:35:38,070
In my new movie,

2397
01:35:38,434 --> 01:35:41,381
Super star Rajani sir is the Hero.

2398
01:35:42,167 --> 01:35:44,738
You must act as villain.

2399
01:35:45,467 --> 01:35:46,207
Sit sir.

2400
01:35:46,334 --> 01:35:49,042
No need, I have no time to sit.

2401
01:35:50,067 --> 01:35:51,740
I have to come here see you,

2402
01:35:52,067 --> 01:35:53,603
Give the advance and go.

2403
01:35:53,734 --> 01:35:56,977
That's why I came
in the morning Airlndia.

2404
01:35:57,434 --> 01:35:59,004
But the dates,

2405
01:35:59,201 --> 01:36:00,236
Is a problem.

2406
01:36:00,334 --> 01:36:01,404
Didn't my manager tell you about it?

2407
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,409
Why manager sir?

2408
01:36:04,134 --> 01:36:07,047
I came to talk to you directly.

2409
01:36:07,234 --> 01:36:08,736
You take the advance sir.

2410
01:36:09,067 --> 01:36:11,411
There is 40 Iakh in this.

2411
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:13,340
But you didn't give still?

2412
01:36:13,501 --> 01:36:15,708
Oh fool, you are talking too much.

2413
01:36:16,134 --> 01:36:17,545
Take this brother.

2414
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,701
God!

2415
01:36:20,034 --> 01:36:22,605
If advance is so much then
how much will he be getting in real.

2416
01:36:23,234 --> 01:36:25,180
In Tamil he takes in crores.

2417
01:36:26,200 --> 01:36:27,611
His luck.

2418
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,612
If he thinks we can get
chance in Tamil and Telugu too.

2419
01:36:31,801 --> 01:36:33,576
Let's talk and see.

2420
01:36:33,734 --> 01:36:35,680
We have cheated him properly.

2421
01:36:36,034 --> 01:36:37,012
Keeping them in heart.

2422
01:36:37,100 --> 01:36:39,080
No, he wouldn't have known about it.

2423
01:36:39,534 --> 01:36:40,535
This is how cinema is.

2424
01:36:40,767 --> 01:36:42,371
Who is big,
we have to be in touch with them.

2425
01:36:42,434 --> 01:36:43,970
Whom you see now call him the father.

2426
01:36:44,100 --> 01:36:45,078
Correct.

2427
01:36:45,234 --> 01:36:47,441
Go talkto him and see, what if it clicks?

2428
01:36:48,467 --> 01:36:50,674
Not now people are around him maybe later.

2429
01:36:51,234 --> 01:36:51,769
Okay.

2430
01:36:56,001 --> 01:36:56,672
Hey did Manichettan go?

2431
01:36:56,767 --> 01:36:57,745
He is in makeup room.

2432
01:36:58,000 --> 01:36:59,343
Keep it carefully.

2433
01:37:00,134 --> 01:37:01,408
He ran with is life.

2434
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:03,511
No I can't give phone number.

2435
01:37:03,601 --> 01:37:04,409
Hi Chetta.

2436
01:37:04,767 --> 01:37:05,745
How come here?

2437
01:37:06,034 --> 01:37:06,478
Just like that.

2438
01:37:07,501 --> 01:37:08,571
This look is good.

2439
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:13,081
What look? What are we?

2440
01:37:13,201 --> 01:37:14,475
We are normal people sister.

2441
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:15,738
True.

2442
01:37:16,500 --> 01:37:18,377
Now you are a star
in Tamil and Telugu too.

2443
01:37:18,567 --> 01:37:20,410
Notjust there even in
Malayalam he is quiet busy.

2444
01:37:20,534 --> 01:37:22,241
Oh I didn't mean that.

2445
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,273
I came to tell you my wish.

2446
01:37:28,401 --> 01:37:29,607
What? Tell me.

2447
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:36,236
She is trying to mingle.

2448
01:37:36,334 --> 01:37:37,244
- What is it Sukhu?
- She has wishes.

2449
01:37:37,334 --> 01:37:38,312
Will it be greediness?

2450
01:37:38,434 --> 01:37:39,344
Don't take tension.

2451
01:37:39,667 --> 01:37:41,374
Sit, let's sit and talk.

2452
01:37:42,134 --> 01:37:42,737
Sit.

2453
01:37:45,534 --> 01:37:46,342
What is it?

2454
01:37:46,667 --> 01:37:48,647
I have a desire.

2455
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,536
To act in Tamil and Telugu.

2456
01:37:50,767 --> 01:37:52,110
It will happen if Manichettan think.

2457
01:37:52,501 --> 01:37:53,536
In your next movie?

2458
01:37:53,634 --> 01:37:54,544
It will work.

2459
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:57,444
But there everyone is dark heroes.

2460
01:37:57,634 --> 01:37:59,545
You don't like them right?

2461
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,438
Manichetta, don't tease me.

2462
01:38:01,701 --> 01:38:03,271

2463

01:38:08,067 --> 01:38:10,069
No need, I want it with you.

2465
01:38:10,367 --> 01:38:15,077
"Like the ripe jackfruit a bubbly Kalyani,
a bubbly Kalyani"

2466
01:38:15,200 --> 01:38:17,544
Mani, pick the call.

2467
01:38:18,600 --> 01:38:19,738
Who is it?

2468
01:38:20,634 --> 01:38:21,112
Hello.

2469
01:38:21,767 --> 01:38:22,302
Yes.

2470
01:38:25,367 --> 01:38:26,107
I will come right away.

2471
01:38:28,101 --> 01:38:30,206
Our Raju's kid is serious.

2472
01:38:30,434 --> 01:38:31,504
I have to go to hospital.

2473
01:38:32,201 --> 01:38:32,736
Take the vehicle.

2474
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:33,407
Ramu.

2475
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:37,044
What happened?

2476
01:38:40,534 --> 01:38:41,239
Son.

2477
01:38:49,167 --> 01:38:50,168
Son.

2478
01:38:53,734 --> 01:38:55,236
Don't keep hope.

2479
01:38:57,534 --> 01:38:59,275
Inform whomever you want to inform.

2480
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:01,038
Nothing will happen.

2481
01:39:01,601 --> 01:39:03,581
What are you saying?

2482
01:39:07,334 --> 01:39:08,472
My son,

2483
01:39:09,301 --> 01:39:11,042
Can you save him Manichetta?

2484
01:39:12,467 --> 01:39:13,445
Where is Tom doctor?

2485
01:39:13,634 --> 01:39:14,738
He is in consulting room.

2486
01:39:18,334 --> 01:39:21,110
Don't worry, Mani is with us.

2487
01:39:21,334 --> 01:39:24,406
Our son will get the best
medication found in this world.

2488
01:39:25,067 --> 01:39:26,569
You be strong, come.

2489
01:39:27,300 --> 01:39:28,745
Doctor.

2490
01:39:29,434 --> 01:39:30,412
Sit.

2491
01:39:32,501 --> 01:39:34,003
Is there no hope?

2492
01:39:34,067 --> 01:39:36,047
There is a hope of heart transplantation.

2493
01:39:36,300 --> 01:39:38,371
But it will belittle expensive.

2494
01:39:38,567 --> 01:39:40,274
Can they take so much expense?

2495
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:43,439
Will the kid survive
if you transplant the heart?

2496
01:39:43,567 --> 01:39:46,070
There are chances.

2497
01:39:47,134 --> 01:39:49,011
Then fine, money right?

2498
01:39:49,301 --> 01:39:50,279
We will get it.

2499
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:53,444
He is notjust my friend.

2500
01:39:53,734 --> 01:39:55,270
He is my blood too.

2501
01:39:55,601 --> 01:39:57,239
His pain.

2502
01:39:57,367 --> 01:39:59,347
Is our pain too.

2503
01:40:00,367 --> 01:40:01,505
You don't worry.

2504
01:40:02,001 --> 01:40:03,241
Nothing will happen to him.

2505
01:40:04,101 --> 01:40:05,444
- Right Sukhu.
- Mani.

2506
01:40:08,167 --> 01:40:09,544
You are giving my life.

2507
01:40:11,167 --> 01:40:12,373
What is this?

2508
01:40:12,767 --> 01:40:13,711
Don't cry.

2509
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,074

2513
01:40:24,434 --> 01:40:26,471

2514
01:40:28,101 --> 01:40:29,079

Iam stinking.

2518
01:40:35,801 --> 01:40:36,677
It's okay.

2519
01:40:38,034 --> 01:40:38,637
Why?

2520
01:40:38,767 --> 01:40:40,303
Don't call me madam.

2521
01:40:40,434 --> 01:40:42,345
I like you a lot.

2522
01:40:42,501 --> 01:40:43,775
Oh!

2523
01:40:45,667 --> 01:40:46,737
Carry me and go.

2524
01:40:46,801 --> 01:40:48,212
Why?

2525
01:40:48,767 --> 01:40:49,711
I will tell you.

2526
01:40:50,667 --> 01:40:52,704
Hold me tightly.

2527
01:40:52,801 --> 01:40:55,213
Don't feel shy.

2528
01:40:55,434 --> 01:40:56,504
Carry me dear.

2529
01:40:57,101 --> 01:40:58,079
Carry me.

2530
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:07,278
Cut it.

2531
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:09,605
Excellent, very good.

2532
01:41:09,734 --> 01:41:11,372
- Very good.
- Thank you sir.

2533
01:41:12,367 --> 01:41:13,437
It's good.

2534
01:41:13,534 --> 01:41:14,706
Kavitha, you nailed it.

2535
01:41:14,767 --> 01:41:15,211
Thank you.

2536
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:16,278
You learnt Telugu quickly.

2537
01:41:16,368 --> 01:41:17,779
You are the hero of Telugu.

2538
01:41:18,234 --> 01:41:21,215
I didn't expect I will get
a chance so soon in Telugu movie.

2539
01:41:21,301 --> 01:41:22,439
Hats off to you.

2540
01:41:22,534 --> 01:41:24,172
Nothing as such.

2541
01:41:24,301 --> 01:41:25,336
It's your luck.

2542
01:41:27,034 --> 01:41:29,275
I wanted to ask you something.

2543
01:41:29,501 --> 01:41:30,241
What is it?

2544
01:41:31,701 --> 01:41:33,237
No need I will ask you later.

2545
01:41:47,734 --> 01:41:50,010
What kick did you give?
Gear entered my throat.

2546
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:50,669
Hey Mani.

2547
01:41:58,767 --> 01:41:59,575
Amani?

2548
01:41:59,667 --> 01:42:00,577
Iam coming.

2549
01:42:02,367 --> 01:42:04,176
Take the kids and
sleep underthe table.

2550
01:42:04,667 --> 01:42:07,648
It's been 3 years since there have been holes
on this roof, you don't have to know anything.

2551
01:42:07,767 --> 01:42:09,144
Keep it soon.

2552
01:42:10,267 --> 01:42:13,248
God, when this rain
started not stopping at all.

2553
01:42:16,367 --> 01:42:18,040
Mani, Mani.

2554
01:42:20,267 --> 01:42:22,110
Where is he going in this rain?

2555
01:42:28,767 --> 01:42:30,303
Look Mani brother.

2556
01:42:32,334 --> 01:42:34,575
What is he doing in this rain?

2557
01:42:34,701 --> 01:42:36,203
Ifl get wet in rain
I will get stomach will hurt.

2558
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:37,404
What are you doing here Mani brothel'?

2559
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:40,513
Nothing, I saw the kids and got down.

2560
01:42:41,234 --> 01:42:42,736
If you get inside
you will get wet more.

2561
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:44,078
No need it's okay.

2562
01:42:44,267 --> 01:42:46,645
If it rains this is our situation.

2563
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,980
It's been 2 years since
the children's father died.

2564
01:42:49,634 --> 01:42:50,772
I understand.

2565
01:42:51,267 --> 01:42:52,644
I was also like this.

2566
01:42:53,300 --> 01:42:57,510
If it rains not one drop of rain
water used to go out of the house.

2567
01:42:58,800 --> 01:43:00,370
Is this your own house?

2568
01:43:00,534 --> 01:43:02,207
Yes they gave this 3 cent.

2569
01:43:02,300 --> 01:43:03,506
Okay.

2570
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:05,775
Let's build a good house here.

2571
01:43:06,301 --> 01:43:08,042
The one which don't leak in rain,

2572
01:43:08,101 --> 01:43:10,445
A new house with power and light.

2573
01:43:11,101 --> 01:43:11,670
Jose.

2574
01:43:11,801 --> 01:43:13,678
Tomorrow itself you
must come here and see okay?

2575
01:43:14,101 --> 01:43:15,580
They will do everything.

2576
01:43:19,234 --> 01:43:21,111
With this kids buy chocolates okay.

2577
01:43:21,267 --> 01:43:23,076
Beautiful kid keep this okay.

2578
01:43:23,234 --> 01:43:23,712
What's your name?

2579
01:43:23,801 --> 01:43:25,246
Chinni kutti.

2580
01:43:25,367 --> 01:43:26,243
Let Mani brother go now.

2581
01:43:26,700 --> 01:43:28,077
Why are you getting wet?

2582
01:43:28,267 --> 01:43:36,584
"Firefly,
firefly why are you in hurry?"

2583
01:43:36,634 --> 01:43:45,076
"You are alone right? You will
be afraid shall I accompany you?"

2584
01:43:45,601 --> 01:43:48,445
Smart, you sang well.

2585
01:44:05,067 --> 01:44:06,205
Why is Mani standing there?

2586
01:44:07,067 --> 01:44:08,774
He is like that, go and see.

2587
01:44:09,467 --> 01:44:10,741
He will be crying.

2588
01:44:12,634 --> 01:44:13,738
It's his habit.

2589
01:44:14,101 --> 01:44:16,342
If he cries in rain no one will see.

2590
01:44:33,167 --> 01:44:34,168
Juice is ready.

2591
01:44:35,200 --> 01:44:36,406
Everyone drinkjuice and be here.

2592
01:44:36,468 --> 01:44:37,708
Mani will come now.

2593
01:44:38,234 --> 01:44:38,609
H 6V-

2594
01:44:38,734 --> 01:44:41,112
Keep this juice away
and give scotch to everyone.

2595
01:44:41,567 --> 01:44:43,569
For that fellow there give him toddy.

2596
01:44:43,701 --> 01:44:46,739
My dear Ramappa go and
sit somewhere we will give.

2597
01:44:47,067 --> 01:44:48,705
When head is there no
need for the tail to make move.

2598
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,173
But head is not sitting right?
Go and sit somewhere brother.

2599
01:44:51,334 --> 01:44:53,314
You don't make me sit.

2600
01:44:53,734 --> 01:44:54,735
Oh now the mike is in trouble.

2601
01:44:55,601 --> 01:44:57,774
Hello, hello, hello.

2602
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:00,111
Let's give it the other side.

2603
01:45:00,234 --> 01:45:02,680
There is no sound heard from this,
are you fooling?

2604
01:45:05,134 --> 01:45:06,579
- Greetings Mani brother.
- Greetings.

2605
01:45:07,167 --> 01:45:08,578
- Greetings Mani brother.
- Sit, sit.

2606
01:45:10,034 --> 01:45:12,036
No need of so much respect.

2607
01:45:12,267 --> 01:45:14,110
I am the father.

2608
01:45:16,267 --> 01:45:17,541
He is taking out the drinks.

2609
01:45:18,400 --> 01:45:21,074
Ifyou take it out I will hit you.

2610
01:45:21,134 --> 01:45:23,637
With Tamil and Telugu
I got little busy.

2611
01:45:23,801 --> 01:45:25,508
I am unable to meet you guys.

2612
01:45:25,700 --> 01:45:27,680
Today I will clearthat complaint.

2613
01:45:27,767 --> 01:45:29,371
Being only a comedian Rajamani,

2614
01:45:29,601 --> 01:45:32,172
When the first movie you
acted as Hero and it was a hit.

2615
01:45:32,267 --> 01:45:33,371
Many said jackfruit
fell and rabbit died.

2616
01:45:33,767 --> 01:45:37,408
Now Rajamani has turned into
the busiest actor in south India.

2617
01:45:37,534 --> 01:45:39,480
- What do you feel?
- Feels proud.

2618
01:45:40,701 --> 01:45:42,180
I feel happy-

2619
01:45:42,501 --> 01:45:44,310
I neverthought I
will reach still here.

2620
01:45:44,634 --> 01:45:46,113
Who didn't think?

2621
01:45:46,267 --> 01:45:47,644
- I knew it.
- He started.

2622
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:51,077
The astrologer had said
that he will become a big actor.

2623
01:45:51,434 --> 01:45:53,505
It's all His blessings.

2624
01:45:53,767 --> 01:45:55,075
Then her prayers.

2625
01:45:55,267 --> 01:45:58,248
All this is her luck too.

2626
01:45:58,434 --> 01:46:00,141
Only after she became a part of me.

2627
01:46:00,267 --> 01:46:02,042
All this happened.

2628
01:46:02,101 --> 01:46:04,445
I have something to say.

2629
01:46:05,467 --> 01:46:06,775
What father?

2630
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:09,435
What do you have to say?

2631
01:46:09,634 --> 01:46:11,409
Nothing, I have nothing to say.

2632
01:46:11,501 --> 01:46:13,310
Was it an arranged marriage?

2633
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:14,743
Why are you asking so?

2634
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,713
My son is dark.

2635
01:46:18,234 --> 01:46:20,612
And saying that his caste is low.

2636
01:46:20,700 --> 01:46:22,771
Many have rejected him.

2637
01:46:23,134 --> 01:46:26,411
But God himselfgave
this beautiful girl to my son.

2638
01:46:26,501 --> 01:46:27,741
Do you know?

2639
01:46:28,034 --> 01:46:29,411
One question to Mrs. Rajamani.

2640
01:46:29,501 --> 01:46:32,038
How is the life with a cinema actor?

2641
01:46:32,134 --> 01:46:33,010
Tell.

2642
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:35,707
I am lucky enough to be Mani's wife.

2643
01:46:35,767 --> 01:46:38,509
So it's over lets drink?

2644
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:41,036
In Trikaavil temple,

2645
01:46:41,234 --> 01:46:43,077
I saw Anitha forthe first time.

2646
01:46:49,134 --> 01:46:51,705
I thought it's just my thinking.

2647
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:55,409
Then I saw her properly.

2648
01:46:59,434 --> 01:47:02,574
Then I started visiting
temple regularly.

2649
01:47:03,034 --> 01:47:05,446
I can see God and also.

2650
01:47:05,734 --> 01:47:07,509
Valya house Menon sir's?

2651
01:47:07,634 --> 01:47:08,578
Daughter.

2652
01:47:08,734 --> 01:47:10,577
Don't you know me? I am Rajamani.

2653
01:47:10,767 --> 01:47:11,438
I know.

2654
01:47:11,601 --> 01:47:13,512
Once I knew Anitha likes me.

2655
01:47:13,701 --> 01:47:17,308
I decided to ask
Menon sir for her hand.

2656
01:47:17,434 --> 01:47:19,505
But when I saw Menon sir's silence.

2657
01:47:19,634 --> 01:47:21,136
I thought it's gone.

2658
01:47:21,300 --> 01:47:24,372
When we went to Kanoor girl's
father was Aromal's son in law.

2659
01:47:24,467 --> 01:47:26,708
Will this be a relative
of Thacholichan?

2660
01:47:28,301 --> 01:47:30,212
But Menon sir said something else.

2661
01:47:30,434 --> 01:47:31,412
What caste?

2662
01:47:31,667 --> 01:47:33,544
There is only caste on this earth.

2663
01:47:34,100 --> 01:47:35,170
Humanity.

2664
01:47:35,734 --> 01:47:39,238
Then in my life only
luck and heights were there.

2665
01:47:39,434 --> 01:47:41,072
So it's over right? Let's drink.

2666
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:45,240
Oh he came.

2667
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,979
Greetings, oh my Sooriyanna
do you know where and all I went?

2668
01:47:49,134 --> 01:47:51,705
If it was a blue film
I would have easily got it.

2669
01:47:52,334 --> 01:47:54,712
You are the true Sabu secretary.

2670
01:47:55,134 --> 01:47:56,442
You have a good future.

2671
01:47:56,568 --> 01:47:59,733
I don't like this alcohol at all.

2672
01:47:59,734 --> 01:48:02,544
I won't say so I love it.

2673
01:48:02,801 --> 01:48:04,041
Sabu pour one more.

2674
01:48:04,134 --> 01:48:05,010
No need, no need.

2675
01:48:05,134 --> 01:48:06,511
Let's talk first and then drink.

2676
01:48:06,600 --> 01:48:07,977
Suriya is already too much now.

2677
01:48:08,067 --> 01:48:08,977
No.

2678
01:48:09,167 --> 01:48:10,043
Kananuni.

2679
01:48:10,267 --> 01:48:12,611
We must destroy that
company of Hari completely.

2680
01:48:12,767 --> 01:48:16,237
You were doing lot of
work under him for some time.

2681
01:48:17,001 --> 01:48:20,448
That's why we are giving
all this work to Kananuni.

2682
01:48:21,067 --> 01:48:23,274
Instead of bending your
knees in front of the stars,

2683
01:48:23,401 --> 01:48:26,974
It's better to have a street
shot in Paalarivatta is what he said.

2684
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,108
We will make director
Hari in Paalarivatta,

2685
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:31,711
Put a street shop.

2686
01:48:31,767 --> 01:48:33,610
No need of street shop.

2687
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:35,679
Let him put a toddy shop.

2688
01:48:36,767 --> 01:48:41,307
But that Hari shouldn't raise
his finger at the stars, if he does,

2689
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:42,606
Not just the finger.

2690
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:44,610
We will chop his hand also.

2691
01:48:44,701 --> 01:48:46,112
That's what even I want.

2692
01:48:46,267 --> 01:48:48,304
The one who came to teach
me the rules in cinema.

2693
01:48:48,534 --> 01:48:50,070
We don't want him in cinema.

2694
01:48:50,601 --> 01:48:52,603
If we take Hari out from industry.

2695
01:48:53,034 --> 01:48:54,775
Two superstars date,

2696
01:48:55,234 --> 01:48:57,180
Will be given to me.

2697
01:48:57,800 --> 01:48:59,074
Remember right?

2698
01:49:00,001 --> 01:49:01,674
He is the one who
got profit out ofthis.

2699
01:49:02,234 --> 01:49:04,612
He will do only super
stars movies henceforth.

2700
01:49:07,301 --> 01:49:09,474
He is coming, Hari's assistant.

2701
01:49:09,801 --> 01:49:11,781
Everyone is here, greetings sir.

2702
01:49:12,001 --> 01:49:12,741

Sit.

2706
01:49:16,534 --> 01:49:17,512
Just sit.

2707
01:49:17,601 --> 01:49:19,740
Should I sit down or on lap?

2708
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,073
I will stand here sir.

2709
01:49:22,267 --> 01:49:23,712
Why did you call me for?

2710
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:25,773
Malayalam cinema's directors,

2711
01:49:26,101 --> 01:49:27,341
New associations,

2712
01:49:27,767 --> 01:49:29,644
Secretary is Kananuni.

2713
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:31,074
He will tell the matter.

2714
01:49:32,167 --> 01:49:33,373

Disrespecting an,

01:49:35,134 --> 01:49:37,614
He disrespected our art?

2717
01:49:37,734 --> 01:49:38,769
Without my knowledge?

2718
01:49:39,067 --> 01:49:41,172
Not that Kala, its art field.

2719
01:49:43,201 --> 01:49:46,774
He has dirtied the entire art field.

2720
01:49:47,134 --> 01:49:48,374
We are banning him.

2721
01:49:49,634 --> 01:49:51,705
He is the leader.

2722
01:49:52,601 --> 01:49:55,241
I am not acting in
any of Hari sir's movies.

2723
01:49:55,334 --> 01:49:57,746
But for my new movie's deity.

2724
01:49:58,067 --> 01:49:59,671
It will be Hari sirwho
will be lighting the lamp.

2725
01:50:00,134 --> 01:50:01,772
Just lighting lam p
right let him do it.

2726
01:50:02,134 --> 01:50:05,206
No need in manners and in status too,

2727
01:50:05,467 --> 01:50:07,003
He has done lot of dirty works.

2728
01:50:07,167 --> 01:50:09,010
We don't want him
in cinema field anymore.

2729
01:50:09,101 --> 01:50:10,045
Okay no need.

2730
01:50:13,700 --> 01:50:15,236
What are you doing?

2731
01:50:15,467 --> 01:50:16,241
Hey Mani.

2732
01:50:18,767 --> 01:50:19,575
Oh no.

2733
01:50:21,767 --> 01:50:22,643
Oh.

2734
01:50:23,267 --> 01:50:24,712
What kind ofdrinking is this Mani?

2735
01:50:25,267 --> 01:50:26,644
Even I got stunned.

2736
01:50:26,701 --> 01:50:28,977
Forgive sir, this is the
habit of us from Chaalakudi.

2737
01:50:29,301 --> 01:50:30,336
One sip we finish it.

2738
01:50:30,534 --> 01:50:31,569
Smart.

2739
01:50:31,667 --> 01:50:33,010
Kananuni sir.

2740
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,008
Don't scare us.

2741
01:50:34,267 --> 01:50:36,577
Tomorrow the one who will
be lighting the lamp for my movie,

2742
01:50:36,734 --> 01:50:38,077
Will be Hari sir.

2743
01:50:38,267 --> 01:50:39,541
It's my good luck charm.

2744
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,273
Oh like that.

2745
01:50:42,367 --> 01:50:44,142
He is good.

2746
01:50:44,767 --> 01:50:47,145
He drank 34 pegs together.

2747
01:50:47,467 --> 01:50:48,537
Very strong.

2748
01:50:49,601 --> 01:50:50,978
What strong?

2749
01:50:51,267 --> 01:50:53,406
More stronger people than them,

2750
01:50:53,567 --> 01:50:56,070
We have made them kneel
down and ask for forgiveness.

2751
01:50:56,400 --> 01:50:58,676
Malayalam cinema's roaring lion,

2752
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:01,371
Tilothaman, what is his current state?

2753
01:51:01,567 --> 01:51:05,413
From Christian fathers and
English movies we took him out right?

2754
01:51:05,667 --> 01:51:09,308
What is this Mani,
who has no name and place?

2755
01:51:10,101 --> 01:51:11,409
Who is standing there?

2756
01:51:11,667 --> 01:51:13,613
Hey Mani, haven't you gone yet?

2757
01:51:15,067 --> 01:51:16,102
Thief.

2758
01:51:18,401 --> 01:51:19,539
Brother.

2759
01:51:19,800 --> 01:51:21,541
I didn't see.

2760
01:51:26,267 --> 01:51:28,076
You get LIP-

2761
01:51:29,301 --> 01:51:30,541
Get up.

2762
01:51:33,201 --> 01:51:35,238
What did you say in TV today?

2763
01:51:36,067 --> 01:51:38,445
The actor in Thilothaman died.

2764
01:51:38,734 --> 01:51:41,078
Do you knowthe meaning of acting?

2765
01:51:41,767 --> 01:51:43,178
Kananuni.

2766
01:51:44,134 --> 01:51:44,737
Tell me.

2767
01:51:45,534 --> 01:51:48,344
That's because you
were in bad manners,

2768
01:51:49,401 --> 01:51:50,778
And bad behavior.

2769
01:51:51,101 --> 01:51:52,375
Ba, ba, ba, ba.

2770
01:51:53,701 --> 01:51:56,079
You all have gathered here to discuss,

2771
01:51:56,368 --> 01:51:59,076
About banning actors,
I have come knowing that.

2772
01:52:00,201 --> 01:52:02,238
You called Ayikode as crazy.

2773
01:52:02,434 --> 01:52:04,573
Now you want to destroy Hari.

2774
01:52:04,767 --> 01:52:07,338
Forthat you will
say any kind of lies.

2775
01:52:07,634 --> 01:52:08,738
Hey Kananuni.

2776
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,404
The association that
you are making now.

2777
01:52:11,101 --> 01:52:12,580
For the heads of the cinemas,

2778
01:52:12,767 --> 01:52:14,212
And for your sake.

2779
01:52:14,467 --> 01:52:16,572
Understood Kananuni.

2780
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:21,774
But Su riya.

2781
01:52:22,167 --> 01:52:24,113
I didn't expect you in this group.

2782
01:52:25,267 --> 01:52:27,042
You were like a son to me.

2783
01:52:29,567 --> 01:52:31,103
To ban me,

2784
01:52:32,501 --> 01:52:33,479
Okay.

2785
01:52:34,034 --> 01:52:35,707
Tilothaman brother
don't get emotional.

2786
01:52:35,767 --> 01:52:37,713
Sit here, what is this?

2787
01:52:37,767 --> 01:52:39,178
Hey Dhinesh.

2788
01:52:39,468 --> 01:52:42,608
I know you are the most
poisonous in this group.

2789
01:52:43,201 --> 01:52:46,114
You arethe main role in this group.

2790
01:52:47,334 --> 01:52:48,574
If you go fonlvard Iikethis.

2791
01:52:49,268 --> 01:52:51,748
Time will give it back to you,
be careful.

2792
01:52:57,134 --> 01:52:58,613
Kananuni got scared.

2793
01:53:03,768 --> 01:53:06,772
- Who ran?
- That's great actor Rajamani sir.

2794
01:53:07,634 --> 01:53:09,307
- Which room?
-504.

2795
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:11,270
Keep this bag in my room.

2796
01:53:11,534 --> 01:53:12,137
Sir.

2797
01:53:20,267 --> 01:53:21,041
Hari sir.

2798
01:53:21,234 --> 01:53:22,577
Why did you run seeing me?

2799
01:53:25,267 --> 01:53:27,144
I am unfaithful guy sir.

2800
01:53:27,267 --> 01:53:29,178
Rogue, only a rogue.

2801
01:53:29,434 --> 01:53:31,072
Butyou didn't do anything right?

2802
01:53:31,600 --> 01:53:33,739
Is there anything
more to do than this?

2803
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:36,580
Though sirtold me no need, no need.

2804
01:53:37,167 --> 01:53:38,578
I took you forcefully.

2805
01:53:39,101 --> 01:53:41,707
Then forthe same movie they made
some other fellow and light the lamp.

2806
01:53:43,434 --> 01:53:44,242
No other way sir.

2807
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:45,473
What you did was right.

2808
01:53:46,167 --> 01:53:49,546
You always say that I
am responsible for your growth.

2809
01:53:50,434 --> 01:53:52,072
If you had taken another decision.

2810
01:53:52,434 --> 01:53:54,539
For your destruction also,

2811
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,102
I am the reason you
would have said this.

2812
01:53:56,700 --> 01:53:58,407
All my hopes are going wrong.

2813
01:53:58,801 --> 01:54:00,337
No matter how big I become.

2814
01:54:00,801 --> 01:54:03,008
I am the same old coconut
tree climber for people.

2815
01:54:05,434 --> 01:54:09,109
Mani, taking all the troubles of life.

2816
01:54:09,401 --> 01:54:12,575
Without anyone's help
you earned this position.

2817
01:54:13,767 --> 01:54:15,303
Don't lose that.

2818
01:54:15,434 --> 01:54:16,970
You must go to greater heights.

2819
01:54:17,534 --> 01:54:18,979
You don't worry about me.

2820
01:54:19,267 --> 01:54:21,975
No one can ban or defeat anyone.

2821
01:54:22,367 --> 01:54:23,209
Except death.

2822
01:54:40,067 --> 01:54:43,412
<i>Paadi, Dravida king's palace.</i>

2823
01:54:43,601 --> 01:54:45,774
Today I will handcuff,

2824
01:54:46,101 --> 01:54:48,411
And take him through Chaalakudi town.

2825
01:54:50,301 --> 01:54:52,008
Good themed set up.

2826
01:54:52,367 --> 01:54:53,471
Is no one here?

2827
01:54:53,767 --> 01:54:54,404
Hello.

2828
01:54:55,234 --> 01:54:57,009
Oh everyone is here.

2829
01:54:57,467 --> 01:54:59,378
How come sir here?

2830
01:54:59,567 --> 01:55:01,342
A black tea?

2831
01:55:01,401 --> 01:55:02,709
Oh black tea?

2832
01:55:03,067 --> 01:55:04,410
I thought toddy.

2833
01:55:04,767 --> 01:55:07,714
Yesterday drinking toddy near forest
check post you gave full performance right?

2834
01:55:08,034 --> 01:55:09,172
We have got com plaint.

2835
01:55:09,334 --> 01:55:10,779
It's over yesterday only sir.

2836
01:55:11,067 --> 01:55:12,774
Who said so?
Come and get in the vehicle.

2837
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:14,670
You should have thought
before drinking.

2838
01:55:15,601 --> 01:55:18,480
Many are trying to
prove that I am a drunkard.

2839
01:55:18,601 --> 01:55:19,739
Let it be.

2840
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,343
But yesterday I wasn't drunk.

2841
01:55:22,734 --> 01:55:24,975
Without reason they came up on me.

2842
01:55:25,167 --> 01:55:26,441
Still Iwas quiet.

2843
01:55:27,600 --> 01:55:28,601
If that's not it.

2844
01:55:28,734 --> 01:55:32,443
And you wish to arrest me
and put me in jail and disrespect me.

2845
01:55:32,634 --> 01:55:33,271
Let it happen.

2846
01:55:33,367 --> 01:55:36,439
Oh respectful person
from respected family.

2847
01:55:37,067 --> 01:55:39,069
You are coconut climber
Ramappan's son right?

2848
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,671
Well known super star, Rajamani.

2849
01:55:42,034 --> 01:55:43,274
Notjust Ramappan,

2850
01:55:43,334 --> 01:55:45,280
Even Rajamani was
a coconut tree climber.

2851
01:55:45,468 --> 01:55:47,470
Why do you want to take
my father's name in vain?

2852
01:55:47,767 --> 01:55:49,303
Don't tell my father's name again.

2853
01:55:49,434 --> 01:55:52,278
Who are you?
A fellow who is from nowhere.

01:55:52,434 --> 01:55:54,414

01:55:56,434 --> 01:55:58,004
You built house for poor ones.

2857
01:55:58,101 --> 01:55:59,239
You made marriages.

2858
01:55:59,334 --> 01:56:01,314
Who are you? Mahabali king?

2859
01:56:02,001 --> 01:56:05,244
You have experience
in hitting police in cinema.

2860
01:56:05,467 --> 01:56:08,004
But have you experience
the heat of the original police?

2861
01:56:08,434 --> 01:56:10,141

2869
01:56:29,634 --> 01:56:31,204
What shameful case?

2870
01:56:31,367 --> 01:56:32,539
It's not rape.

2871
01:56:33,067 --> 01:56:35,513

They will finish it.

2877
01:56:45,534 --> 01:56:47,036
Listen, he is almost killing sir.

2878
01:56:47,134 --> 01:56:49,239
Let's not involve he needs it.

2879
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:51,238
You thought you will do it to me.

2880
01:56:53,701 --> 01:56:57,342
This is the hand which has climbed
trees and done all sort of work.

2881
01:56:57,534 --> 01:56:59,241
If I give you one with this.

2882
01:57:00,267 --> 01:57:02,406
- Sir, ADGP.
- Leave.

2883
01:57:06,267 --> 01:57:07,075
- Sir here.
- To insult Rajamani,

2884
01:57:07,201 --> 01:57:08,373
Few forest officers,

2885
01:57:08,534 --> 01:57:10,571
And police officers,

2886
01:57:10,701 --> 01:57:12,237
Built this fake case.

2887
01:57:12,501 --> 01:57:15,573
Though everyone says save
the schedule caste and protect them.

2888
01:57:15,667 --> 01:57:18,238
When it comes to action
it's only in words.

2889
01:57:18,434 --> 01:57:20,072
For the people belonging to that part,

2890
01:57:20,134 --> 01:57:21,408
An awkward feeling towards them,

2891
01:57:21,567 --> 01:57:22,671
Is what they have in heart.

2892
01:57:22,768 --> 01:57:23,712
Instead of Mani,

2893
01:57:24,067 --> 01:57:27,480
If it was any other super
star who would have done this,

2894
01:57:27,634 --> 01:57:28,704
Would the police behave like this?

2895
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,780
So in Malayalam cinemas
are there caste and creed sir'?

2896
01:57:31,101 --> 01:57:32,478
Notjust in Malayalam cinemas.

2897
01:57:32,734 --> 01:57:34,077
In our state,

2898
01:57:34,201 --> 01:57:35,509
When it comes to action,

2899
01:57:35,600 --> 01:57:37,307
These caste and color
will all come up.

2900
01:57:37,467 --> 01:57:40,641
But we won't keep such
kind of people in police.

2901
01:57:53,734 --> 01:57:55,736
Than cinema fight this was superb.

2902
01:57:59,767 --> 01:58:00,768
It's Eepachhan.

2903
01:58:03,234 --> 01:58:03,609
Hello.

2904
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:06,439
RajamanLyou did well.

2905
01:58:07,101 --> 01:58:09,172
ADGP Ben Kumar spoke about you,

2906
01:58:09,234 --> 01:58:11,180
In TV now did you see?

2907
01:58:11,267 --> 01:58:13,577
Why? Didn't Eepachhan like it?

2908
01:58:13,767 --> 01:58:16,304
From the time the forest
officers held me yesterday.

2909
01:58:16,467 --> 01:58:18,606
I have called around 50 times.

2910
01:58:19,134 --> 01:58:22,115
I was about to call the Minister now.

2911
01:58:22,200 --> 01:58:24,111
That's when I saw the news on TV.

2912
01:58:24,267 --> 01:58:26,178
Don't act anymore Eepachha.

2913
01:58:26,434 --> 01:58:28,311
I have seen this a lot.

2914
01:58:28,701 --> 01:58:30,738
When I first acted as Hero.

2915
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:32,670
Saying my caste and color,

2916
01:58:32,734 --> 01:58:35,237
You ignored and left the movie,
without forgetting that,

2917
01:58:35,434 --> 01:58:38,040
I came to help you in election.

2918
01:58:38,268 --> 01:58:41,545
That's Mani, I love my people so much.

2919
01:58:41,701 --> 01:58:45,171
That director Mani just made it up.

2920
01:58:45,700 --> 01:58:48,271
You said so and tried
to make everyone believe that.

2921
01:58:48,534 --> 01:58:52,243
But time is proving that
what Hari sir said was true.

2922
01:58:52,334 --> 01:58:54,109
Okay Eepachha.

2923
01:58:54,567 --> 01:58:55,978
Justgo.

2924
01:59:03,567 --> 01:59:05,308
Understood, this is the shot.

2925
01:59:05,501 --> 01:59:06,741
Superb shot.

2926
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:08,274
Trolley back, trolley back.

2927
01:59:11,734 --> 01:59:13,509
Oh bestjuice.

2928
01:59:14,534 --> 01:59:15,308
Art.

2929
01:59:15,434 --> 01:59:16,310
Fill this glass.

2930
01:59:17,101 --> 01:59:17,704
You finished it?

2931
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:19,070
Very good.

2932
01:59:19,167 --> 01:59:20,237
Mix some more and keep.

2933
01:59:24,134 --> 01:59:24,737
Here.

2934
01:59:25,667 --> 01:59:27,510
Where is it?

2935
01:59:28,667 --> 01:59:29,645
Oh okay.

2936
01:59:30,167 --> 01:59:31,237
Ifthis is the shot.

2937
01:59:31,401 --> 01:59:35,008
Art guy's hands will break
by filling the glass with juice.

2938
01:59:35,567 --> 01:59:37,133
- An.
-
 will rm sir.

2939
01:59:37,134 --> 01:59:38,204
Good.

2940
01:59:38,534 --> 01:59:39,512
Bring and give.

2941
01:59:39,567 --> 01:59:40,545
Jose picked the call.

2942
01:59:40,634 --> 01:59:42,238
Mani is not keeping well.

2943
01:59:42,667 --> 01:59:43,737
How is that possible?

2944
01:59:44,100 --> 01:59:45,170
Ask him to come.

2945
01:59:45,268 --> 01:59:47,578
There are a couple of
shots here then it's over.

2946
01:59:47,667 --> 01:59:49,340
Othenivise too this will finish.

2947
01:59:53,634 --> 01:59:55,580
They are not listening though
I said you are not well, Mani.

2948
01:59:55,667 --> 01:59:57,578
- Let's go.
- I am sick.

2949
01:59:58,267 --> 02:00:00,372
But Mani what about the
money we took in advance?

2950
02:00:00,467 --> 02:00:02,037
- How much did you take?
-5.

2951
02:00:02,234 --> 02:00:03,713
Give it back.

2952
02:00:04,267 --> 02:00:06,247
I am planning to stop acting.

2953
02:00:06,367 --> 02:00:08,404
What are you saying?

2954
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:12,642
Where is the Laddu?

2955
02:00:15,600 --> 02:00:17,443
In the tension that
Mani hasn't come yet.

2956
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:18,676
Sir.

2957
02:00:19,267 --> 02:00:20,473
- What?
- I don't think he will come.

2958
02:00:20,601 --> 02:00:21,443
What?

2959
02:00:21,600 --> 02:00:23,511
He don't like to act now a day.

2960
02:00:23,601 --> 02:00:24,671
If he says so how is it possible?

2961
02:00:24,767 --> 02:00:26,337
He said he will give back the advance.

2962
02:00:27,534 --> 02:00:29,207
Shall we see someone else?

2963
02:00:29,634 --> 02:00:30,135
No need.

2964
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:32,174
No need John.

2965
02:00:32,601 --> 02:00:34,080
Only if he does that
character it will be good.

2966
02:00:34,201 --> 02:00:35,145
But what about your date?

2967
02:00:35,234 --> 02:00:36,338
Don't bother about that.

2968
02:00:36,634 --> 02:00:37,612
You speak to him.

2969
02:00:38,367 --> 02:00:39,072
<i>Iwill come.</i>

2970
02:00:41,601 --> 02:00:42,409
Mani brother.

2971
02:00:43,601 --> 02:00:44,602
How is it going?

2972
02:00:44,767 --> 02:00:47,441
Is it Kavitha? Sit.

2973
02:00:48,134 --> 02:00:49,306
How come here?

2974
02:00:49,734 --> 02:00:51,077
A Telugu film shoot.

2975
02:00:51,234 --> 02:00:53,407
I came for that, that's
when I got to know you are here.

2976
02:00:53,467 --> 02:00:54,309
Which movie?

2977
02:00:54,467 --> 02:00:56,105
Not cinema.

2978
02:00:56,434 --> 02:00:58,573
A program for Malayali assembly.

2979
02:00:59,734 --> 02:01:02,578
Now you are in Tamil,
Telugu and Kannada.

2980
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:04,308
Very busy right?

2981
02:01:04,501 --> 02:01:06,310
It's all because of your help.

2982
02:01:13,434 --> 02:01:15,539
I know only to help.

2983
02:01:16,200 --> 02:01:17,270
What's the reason?

2984
02:01:17,767 --> 02:01:20,373
What's hurt and what's hardship.

2985
02:01:21,400 --> 02:01:23,539
I have experienced it properly.

2986
02:01:24,767 --> 02:01:27,270
Shall I ask you something?

2987
02:01:27,467 --> 02:01:29,413
I thought of asking several times.

2988
02:01:29,534 --> 02:01:30,569
What brother?

2989
02:01:31,567 --> 02:01:34,013
You said you will become my heroine.

2990
02:01:34,267 --> 02:01:35,575
Then you refused it.

2991
02:01:36,800 --> 02:01:40,043
Was it to make fun of me?

2992
02:01:40,701 --> 02:01:44,274
Or was it because my color is black?

2993
02:01:45,568 --> 02:01:47,980
What? Did you forget?

2994
02:01:48,234 --> 02:01:50,578
No, I won't forget.

2995
02:01:52,767 --> 02:01:54,337
In controlling cinema,

2996
02:01:54,501 --> 02:01:56,481
We ladies have no role brother.

2997
02:01:57,101 --> 02:01:58,409
Some decide.

2998
02:01:58,500 --> 02:01:59,570
Sometimes they order.

2999
02:02:01,267 --> 02:02:02,644
We have to obey them.

3000
02:02:03,401 --> 02:02:05,244
They say it's common in cinema.

3001
02:02:06,767 --> 02:02:08,747
Do you know why you don't
understand that brother?

3002
02:02:09,801 --> 02:02:11,337
Because you are only a human.

3003
02:02:11,601 --> 02:02:13,103
An innocent human.

3004
02:02:13,767 --> 02:02:15,371
Attimes notjust in cinemas,

3005
02:02:15,600 --> 02:02:17,238
We will have to act in real life too.

3006
02:02:18,767 --> 02:02:20,576
I am yourfan brother.

3007
02:02:24,334 --> 02:02:26,109
Morning he started drinking.

3008
02:02:26,600 --> 02:02:27,772
He won't listen too.

3009
02:02:28,234 --> 02:02:29,736
He didn't eat anything too.

3010
02:02:40,067 --> 02:02:42,069
From morning you are drinking.

3011
02:02:42,267 --> 02:02:43,610
Eat at least this.

3012
02:02:44,267 --> 02:02:45,507
You go inside,

3013
02:02:46,067 --> 02:02:47,341
And bring one more bottle.

3014
02:02:47,801 --> 02:02:49,576
No need Mani it's too much.

3015
02:02:50,001 --> 02:02:51,344
I need one more peg.

3016
02:02:51,501 --> 02:02:54,107
You listen to me,
how much will you drink like this?

3017
02:02:54,300 --> 02:02:55,608
I asked you to bring.

3018
02:02:55,801 --> 02:02:57,337
Go and get it, go.

3019
02:02:58,567 --> 02:03:00,376
Who to say? Who will listen?

3020
02:03:06,767 --> 02:03:07,575
Here drink.

3021
02:03:10,334 --> 02:03:12,746
- What? Do you want money?
- No need.

3022
02:03:14,201 --> 02:03:17,080
- Then?
- I cameto take you home brother.

3023
02:03:18,534 --> 02:03:20,741
Drinking like this and making
people talk unnecessary things.

3024
02:03:21,267 --> 02:03:22,712
Why are you self spoiling
like this brother?

3025
02:03:23,501 --> 02:03:25,708
You won't understand that.

3026
02:03:26,467 --> 02:03:27,070
You go.

3027
02:03:27,200 --> 02:03:28,611
No, <i>lwill</i> take you and go home.

3028
02:03:28,801 --> 02:03:30,747
Bala I told you to leave.

3029
02:03:30,801 --> 02:03:32,109
Bala you go now.

3030
02:03:32,234 --> 02:03:33,076
<i>Iwill</i> bring Mani.

3031
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:34,975
You guys are spoiling
my brother like this.

3032
02:03:35,101 --> 02:03:36,739
You drink or die do anything you want.

3033
02:03:37,100 --> 02:03:38,238
Just leave my brother alone.

3034
02:03:38,534 --> 02:03:39,512
Brother, come let's go, come.

3035
02:03:42,234 --> 02:03:44,714
I shouldn't see you here again,
get out.

3036
02:04:12,800 --> 02:04:13,642
Is Mani sirthere?

3037
02:04:14,167 --> 02:04:15,475
Oh YOU guys?

3038
02:04:15,667 --> 02:04:17,544
You guys are still alive?

3039
02:04:18,067 --> 02:04:19,546
Mani sir, are you well?

3040
02:04:19,601 --> 02:04:21,638
Oh they have come
to ask about my health,

3041
02:04:21,734 --> 02:04:23,680
All the way from
Chennai taking vehicle.

3042
02:04:23,767 --> 02:04:25,075
Tell the reason why you have come.

3043
02:04:25,168 --> 02:04:27,307
Mani sir we would like to talkto you.

3044
02:04:29,267 --> 02:04:32,714
You complaint SP that we
cheated crores of rupees from you.

3045
02:04:33,734 --> 02:04:35,236
That's not a problem for us.

3046
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:36,609
We will make IG call.

3047
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:40,679
Do you know that we have bigger
actors than you with us in this case?

3048
02:04:41,067 --> 02:04:42,410
That too Malayalam actors.

3049
02:04:42,700 --> 02:04:44,338
Do you want to fight unnecessarily?

3050
02:04:45,367 --> 02:04:47,438
There is no document for
the 10 crores that you gave sir.

3051
02:04:47,601 --> 02:04:49,103
No need of any document.

3052
02:04:49,301 --> 02:04:51,542
If I have given money
I know to take it back too.

3053
02:04:52,100 --> 02:04:55,274
The 10 crore that I gave was
not to push it into yourthroats.

3054
02:04:55,701 --> 02:04:58,113
I gave my money and bought a land.

3055
02:04:58,367 --> 02:05:01,405
With trust I wrote
it on your boss's name.

3056
02:05:01,701 --> 02:05:04,682
Now that land was sold
for 10 times more value.

3057
02:05:05,134 --> 02:05:08,240
I should get 25 crores from that.

3058
02:05:11,534 --> 02:05:13,070
4 crore is there in this.

3059
02:05:13,334 --> 02:05:14,642
This should end here.

3060
02:05:15,567 --> 02:05:17,740
You can't do anything
even ifl don't give this now.

3061
02:05:18,001 --> 02:05:19,674
But a cou rtesy.

3062
02:05:25,701 --> 02:05:27,237
If still it doesn't get over.

3063
02:05:27,434 --> 02:05:28,970
You cannot work with this face again.

3064
02:05:29,101 --> 02:05:31,342
- Take out your hand.
- I will.

3065
02:05:31,701 --> 02:05:32,406
No need leave.

3066
02:05:32,501 --> 02:05:33,536
Leave m e.

3067
02:05:33,600 --> 02:05:35,739
Listen to me Mani let them go.

3068
02:05:35,801 --> 02:05:36,677
Leave.

3069
02:05:40,134 --> 02:05:41,408
Let's inform the police.

3070
02:05:42,234 --> 02:05:43,144
That's stupidity.

3071
02:05:43,634 --> 02:05:44,374
This is black.

3072
02:05:45,301 --> 02:05:46,473
There are chances
that they might inform,

3073
02:05:46,601 --> 02:05:48,444
Police that there is cash here.

3074
02:05:48,601 --> 02:05:50,205
Then what will we do?

3075
02:05:50,401 --> 02:05:51,971
You movethe cash from here.

3076
02:05:52,234 --> 02:05:54,180
What if we keep it in your house?

3077
02:05:54,768 --> 02:05:56,748
No need, it's not safe.

3078
02:05:58,334 --> 02:05:59,711
For now take it to
your house and keep.

3079
02:06:00,767 --> 02:06:02,041
Let no one else know about it now.

3080
02:06:02,367 --> 02:06:04,176
Okay.

3081
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:13,977
H 6V-

3082
02:07:14,367 --> 02:07:16,074
Hey what happened?

3083
02:07:16,300 --> 02:07:17,506
Nothing.

3084
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:19,170
Then what is this blood?

3085
02:07:20,434 --> 02:07:22,471
Haven't I told you not to drink?

3086
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:24,473
-It's okay.
- Get u p.

3087
02:07:24,734 --> 02:07:25,644
Get up.

3088
02:07:29,801 --> 02:07:31,303
He has good drinking habit right?

3089
02:07:31,434 --> 02:07:33,607
Hey nothing as such, occasionally.

3090
02:07:34,234 --> 02:07:36,111
You mean once in a week?

3091
02:07:36,434 --> 02:07:39,210
There is no day ortime
where he won't drink in a week.

3092
02:07:39,301 --> 02:07:40,302
That's true.

3093
02:07:41,167 --> 02:07:43,374
Mani is our favorite artist.

3094
02:07:43,534 --> 02:07:45,241
Vomiting blood means,

3095
02:07:45,434 --> 02:07:46,378
You must stop drinking.

3096
02:07:46,434 --> 02:07:48,573
Oh no, I haven't vomited.

3097
02:07:48,668 --> 02:07:49,544
A little.

3098
02:07:49,634 --> 02:07:51,204
And a little color change that's it.

3099
02:07:51,434 --> 02:07:53,539
No doctor it's been
a couple of times now.

3100
02:07:53,634 --> 02:07:56,114
How much ever it is,
you must completely stop drinking.

3101
02:07:56,567 --> 02:07:58,069
If not you will lose liver.

3102
02:07:58,267 --> 02:07:59,712
If it becomes addiction
it's very difficult to stop.

3103
02:08:00,300 --> 02:08:01,779
So stay here for a week.

3104
02:08:02,034 --> 02:08:02,978
It would be a rest too.

3105
02:08:03,101 --> 02:08:04,205
No, it's not possible.

3106
02:08:04,301 --> 02:08:06,440
Today we have auto drivers program.

3107
02:08:06,634 --> 02:08:09,205
I was also an auto driver before.

3108
02:08:09,401 --> 02:08:11,438
Program means it's a strain Mani.

3109
02:08:11,534 --> 02:08:13,445
That's not a problem.

3110
02:08:13,634 --> 02:08:15,545
Program means it's a spirit for me.

3111
02:08:15,634 --> 02:08:19,081
When I get on the stage and
sing I won't feel any sickness.

3112
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:21,673
I will take medicines.

3113
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:22,603
Then okay.

3114
02:08:24,367 --> 02:08:25,710
Don't make him touch alcohol.

3115
02:08:25,801 --> 02:08:26,245
Okay sir.

3116
02:08:48,534 --> 02:08:52,448

days I used ride the vehicle"

3117

Joy brother come, when did you reach?

3149
02:11:58,300 --> 02:11:59,074
I came yesterday.

3150
02:11:59,200 --> 02:12:00,076
What is this Joy brother?

3151
02:12:00,167 --> 02:12:01,339
You hold this Mani.

3152
02:12:03,100 --> 02:12:06,013
Coming from Dubai
you are bringing teddy?

3153
02:12:06,100 --> 02:12:07,340
Everyone will get scotch.

3154
02:12:07,467 --> 02:12:09,469
I prepared this toddy,
medicinal toddy.

3155
02:12:09,601 --> 02:12:10,511
But Joy brother.

3156
02:12:10,601 --> 02:12:12,239
If you drinkthis
it's good for liver Mani.

3157
02:12:12,334 --> 02:12:13,745
It's prepared using medicine.

3158
02:12:14,001 --> 02:12:15,241
You taste and see.

3159
02:12:19,367 --> 02:12:23,213

Mani.

3165
02:12:45,601 --> 02:12:46,579
Sukhu and others are sitting outside,

3166
02:12:46,667 --> 02:12:48,704
And taking money, you drink this.

3167
02:12:49,100 --> 02:12:50,408
It's a problem if they see.

3168
02:12:50,701 --> 02:12:52,180
POLII' SOON, POLII' 500D.

3169
02:12:53,267 --> 02:12:54,211
Enough, enough.

3170

It's original scotch.

3171
02:12:59,734 --> 02:13:01,441
- Drink this too.
- Pour soon.

3172
02:13:02,434 --> 02:13:03,344
Enough, enough.

3173
02:13:08,567 --> 02:13:10,410
Take it away,
keep it aside they shouldn't see it.

3174
02:13:26,634 --> 02:13:28,409
Oh Meenuty?

3175
02:13:28,634 --> 02:13:30,238
Your house is here right?

3176
02:13:30,634 --> 02:13:33,766
Yes, I had called you couple oftimes.

3177
02:13:33,767 --> 02:13:36,748
If Meenuty calls will I forget?

3178
02:13:37,234 --> 02:13:40,408
I remember is he the
one who is not keeping well?

3179
02:13:41,401 --> 02:13:44,644
Yes, my third child.

3180
02:13:45,601 --> 02:13:48,377
Children's father died two years ago.

3181
02:13:48,768 --> 02:13:51,180
Kunjappu told me everything.

3182
02:13:52,267 --> 02:13:53,746
Son is having brain tumor.

3183
02:13:54,601 --> 02:13:57,207
They are saying that they
have to open the skull and operate.

3184
02:13:57,800 --> 02:14:00,246
I don't have anyone now to help.

3185
02:14:00,501 --> 02:14:02,208
Meenuty don't cry.

3186
02:14:02,434 --> 02:14:04,744
He is the one who sang
song over phone for me?

3187
02:14:05,001 --> 02:14:06,207
Can you sing one now?

3188
02:14:07,067 --> 02:14:08,444
Sing and show him son.

3189
02:14:08,601 --> 02:14:09,306
Which song?

3190
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,970
Sing yourfavorite song son.

3191
02:14:11,467 --> 02:14:14,471
"Up north is the sun"

3192
02:14:14,734 --> 02:14:17,738
"Sun that hides by self"

3193
02:14:18,101 --> 02:14:23,380
"the sun that played
in this house yesterday"

3194
02:14:23,534 --> 02:14:29,576
"sleeping under 6feet
ground in the south backyard"

3195
02:14:29,767 --> 02:14:35,615
"sleeping under 6feet
ground in the south backyard"

3196
02:14:36,134 --> 02:14:37,442
Good song.

3197
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:40,209
How much will the operation
cost did they say?

3198
02:14:40,401 --> 02:14:42,574
One more Iakh is needed.

3199
02:14:44,034 --> 02:14:45,741
Jose, take one Iakh from that.

3200
02:14:45,801 --> 02:14:47,371
Take.

3201
02:14:48,734 --> 02:14:50,543
You sang well.

3202
02:14:53,300 --> 02:14:54,005
Take.

3203
02:14:57,267 --> 02:14:59,543
I will neverforgetthis help.

3204
02:14:59,601 --> 02:15:01,046
Meenuty go and get his operation done.

3205
02:15:01,467 --> 02:15:03,538
You must inform me
if your sickness is cured.

3206
02:15:06,034 --> 02:15:08,105
Okaythen go and come happily.

3207
02:15:08,434 --> 02:15:10,175
- Bye.
- Bye.

3208
02:15:16,067 --> 02:15:18,069
Mani, oh no.

3209
02:15:19,034 --> 02:15:21,139
- Hey Sukhu hold him.
-lt's okay.

3210
02:15:34,568 --> 02:15:35,569
So critical.

3211
02:15:36,434 --> 02:15:37,242
Come on.

3212
02:15:45,800 --> 02:15:47,541
I told not to drink.

3213
02:15:47,767 --> 02:15:50,407
We tried he stopped as well.

3214
02:15:52,034 --> 02:15:52,637
This is now,

3215
02:15:53,100 --> 02:15:55,239
There is no chance
of transplantation as well.

3216
02:15:55,667 --> 02:15:57,738
I am telling with the love
towards the love of a great actor.

3217
02:15:58,167 --> 02:16:00,078
Don't make him drink, I beg you.

3218
02:16:00,434 --> 02:16:02,505
Doctor, is it so serious?

3219
02:16:03,168 --> 02:16:04,238
Didn't you understand anything?

3220
02:16:04,334 --> 02:16:05,472
Doctor what should we do now?

3221
02:16:05,634 --> 02:16:07,204
Should we take him
to Apollo in Chennai?

3222
02:16:07,401 --> 02:16:08,744
You can take him anywhere you want.

3223
02:16:09,267 --> 02:16:11,269
But wherever you take him.

3224
02:16:11,400 --> 02:16:13,209
There is no more medication
to be given than this.

3225
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:19,375
Doctor, any other way?

3226
02:16:19,467 --> 02:16:23,176
He is in a state where his
liver cannot be replaced as well.

3227
02:16:23,734 --> 02:16:26,237
If he won'tdrink he
will live for some more time.

3228
02:16:26,601 --> 02:16:28,740
If a 200 ml alcohol enters his body.

3229
02:16:29,134 --> 02:16:31,114
In this current state
anything can happen.

3230
02:16:31,267 --> 02:16:32,211
God.

3231
02:16:38,434 --> 02:16:39,606
Mani.

3232
02:16:40,101 --> 02:16:41,444
Let's go come, get up.

3233
02:16:42,001 --> 02:16:43,378
What did the doctor say?

3234
02:16:43,501 --> 02:16:46,209
But there is no drinking from today.

3235
02:16:46,367 --> 02:16:47,437
He has given medicines.

3236
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:49,179
Come get up.

3237
02:16:49,268 --> 02:16:52,249
"Don't' run, don't run"

3238
02:16:52,467 --> 02:16:55,448
"Don't run and get tired"

3239
02:16:55,601 --> 02:17:00,607
"Let not the beautiful face go dull"

3240
02:17:01,034 --> 02:17:06,313
"lf you take care of the
beautiful without going dull"

3241
02:17:06,500 --> 02:17:10,346
"l will give you a
kiss on the beautiful lips"

3242
02:17:10,467 --> 02:17:11,343
Come guys.

3243
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:13,511
Come, walk.

3244
02:17:14,334 --> 02:17:15,472
Look Sakir is standing there.

3245
02:17:16,267 --> 02:17:18,178
I think it's long
that he has been waiting.

3246
02:17:28,467 --> 02:17:29,411
Leave my hand.

3247
02:17:29,601 --> 02:17:30,773
Don't make me a patient.

3248
02:17:31,234 --> 02:17:32,269
Don't tell Sakir anything.

3249
02:17:32,567 --> 02:17:33,136
Okay.

3250
02:17:33,300 --> 02:17:35,041
"This year we will get"

3251
02:17:35,434 --> 02:17:36,572
When did you come, Sakir?

3252
02:17:36,767 --> 02:17:38,178
Quite some time.

3253
02:17:38,467 --> 02:17:39,172
Where were you?

3254
02:17:39,267 --> 02:17:40,405
I called you many times.

3255
02:17:40,468 --> 02:17:42,175
I was very busy.

3256
02:17:43,067 --> 02:17:44,102
Here.

3257
02:17:44,567 --> 02:17:46,444
Scotch, 90 years old.

3258
02:17:46,634 --> 02:17:49,274
Oh glad, but I don't want it now.

3259
02:17:49,434 --> 02:17:50,538
I am on a fast now.

3260
02:17:51,001 --> 02:17:52,002
To goto Tirumala.

3261
02:17:52,067 --> 02:17:54,047
Okay then keep it.

3262
02:17:54,301 --> 02:17:55,336
You can drink after fast.

3263
02:17:55,734 --> 02:17:56,610
Give it here.

3264
02:18:00,567 --> 02:18:02,240
You go and hide it in outhouse.

3265
02:18:02,400 --> 02:18:03,174
Okay.

3266
02:18:03,401 --> 02:18:05,244
One more tablet has to be bought.

3267
02:18:05,467 --> 02:18:06,502
Buy it.

3268
02:18:07,267 --> 02:18:08,575
- Mani I will be back.
- Okay go and come.

3269
02:18:08,800 --> 02:18:10,143
- Sakir.
- Okay go.

3270
02:18:10,234 --> 02:18:11,406
Okay then.

3271
02:18:11,601 --> 02:18:12,978
Sakir come let's sit inside.

3272
02:18:13,067 --> 02:18:14,102
Okay come.

3273
02:18:15,067 --> 02:18:15,704
Sit.

3274
02:18:16,767 --> 02:18:18,075
Make some black tea.

3275
02:18:18,234 --> 02:18:19,577
- Sugar is fine right?
- Yes.

3276
02:18:20,134 --> 02:18:21,704
- Why did you take such a decision?
- Why?

3277
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:23,172
Ifthe registration is not done,

3278
02:18:23,568 --> 02:18:25,673
We will lose the 10
Iakh given as advance.

3279
02:18:26,600 --> 02:18:28,273
They are not simple guys.

3280
02:18:29,134 --> 02:18:30,078
If the agreement won't happen,

3281
02:18:30,201 --> 02:18:31,737
You won't get back a single rupee.

3282
02:18:32,267 --> 02:18:35,646
If it happens, if you sell
it again you will get 20 lakh profit.

3283
02:18:36,434 --> 02:18:37,504
If you won't get when you catch.

3284
02:18:37,601 --> 02:18:38,636
Then what to do?

3285
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:42,504
Everyone whom I trusted
cheated me properly.

3286
02:18:43,434 --> 02:18:45,710
I put 4 crore rupees trusting you.

3287
02:18:46,767 --> 02:18:49,407
Can you arrange the
rest in a week's time?

3288
02:18:50,100 --> 02:18:51,477
If not all the money is gone.

3289
02:18:51,567 --> 02:18:54,241
It's not that I haven't tried,
if you add it won't increase.

3290
02:18:54,501 --> 02:18:57,345
This real estate
business won't suit me.

3291
02:18:57,434 --> 02:18:58,970
Black tea is ready.

3292
02:18:59,601 --> 02:19:01,774
First time I am drinking
black tea coming here.

3293
02:19:03,467 --> 02:19:03,968
Good.

3294
02:19:04,401 --> 02:19:06,438
6 crore is not a
big deal for you guys.

3295
02:19:07,100 --> 02:19:09,307
If you do a Telugu movie
you can get it back in 56 months.

3296
02:19:09,401 --> 02:19:11,108
But it's not the same with me.

3297
02:19:11,334 --> 02:19:12,766
4 Crore rupee means,

3298
02:19:12,767 --> 02:19:14,440
If I work hard a
lifetime I won't get it.

3299
02:19:14,800 --> 02:19:16,541
You don't worry Sakir.

3300
02:19:17,067 --> 02:19:18,603
You trusted me and putthat4 right?

3301
02:19:18,767 --> 02:19:20,075
<i>Iwill</i> give that.

3302
02:19:20,167 --> 02:19:22,511
You won't go on loss
for standing with Mani.

3303
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:23,977
What happened, Mani?

3304
02:19:24,467 --> 02:19:26,777
In new business Mani close friend.

3305
02:19:27,067 --> 02:19:29,069
I heard that he joined the enemy gang.

3306
02:19:29,268 --> 02:19:30,747
Are these cinema guys like this?

3307
02:19:32,134 --> 02:19:34,273
Acting Sri Raman's role on the screen.

3308
02:19:34,801 --> 02:19:37,213
But in actual life it's Ravan's role.

3309
02:19:37,368 --> 02:19:39,109
There is no use of talking about that.

3310
02:19:39,367 --> 02:19:40,778
I am not there to cheat anyone.

3311
02:19:41,467 --> 02:19:43,413
It's enough if Sakir
gets his money back.

3312
02:19:43,768 --> 02:19:46,112
Then mine.

3313
02:19:47,200 --> 02:19:48,372
It's okay they are all friend's right.

3314
02:19:48,468 --> 02:19:51,039
Raju, take that money
and give it to Sakir.

3315
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,075
No need now,
tomorrow get it to office.

3316
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:54,645
- Then <i>lwill</i> bring it tomorrow morning.
- That's enough.

3317
02:19:55,034 --> 02:19:55,603
Shall I leave then?

3318
02:19:55,733 --> 02:19:57,644
- Okay then let's see later.
- Okay.

3319
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:05,077
Oh you came early.

3320
02:20:05,300 --> 02:20:06,278
Did son wake up?

3321
02:20:07,100 --> 02:20:09,080
Father.

3322
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:10,611
Come, come, father's son come here.

3323
02:20:12,701 --> 02:20:13,475
Are you going to hospital?

3324
02:20:13,601 --> 02:20:15,410
Yes brother, how is Mani brother?

3325
02:20:15,534 --> 02:20:16,512
Now everything is fine.

3326
02:20:17,267 --> 02:20:18,337
What happened to Mani brother?

3327
02:20:18,600 --> 02:20:19,408
Nothing.

3328
02:20:19,534 --> 02:20:21,036
A little chest burn.

3329
02:20:21,167 --> 02:20:22,145
- Then?
-lt's better now.

3330
02:20:22,267 --> 02:20:25,680
Not chest burn,
liver problem because of alcohol.

3331
02:20:26,533 --> 02:20:28,171
You haven't told anything here?

3332
02:20:29,167 --> 02:20:29,736
Shall I leave now sister?

3333
02:20:30,034 --> 02:20:32,173
Ask brother to reduce drinking.

3334
02:20:34,467 --> 02:20:36,674
God, hope nothing happens.

3335
02:20:37,167 --> 02:20:38,737
You freshen up and
come I will make dosa.

3336
02:20:39,067 --> 02:20:41,411
No need, give me that cup board's key.

3337
02:20:41,467 --> 02:20:43,469
I have to take the money.

3338
02:20:43,634 --> 02:20:44,578
What?

3339
02:20:45,467 --> 02:20:46,411
Jessy.

3340
02:20:46,734 --> 02:20:48,714
What happened? Give the key.

3341
02:20:49,001 --> 02:20:50,412
- I have to take the money and go.
- Raju.

3342
02:20:51,667 --> 02:20:52,304
Son.

3343
02:20:52,600 --> 02:20:53,374
Father.

3344
02:20:55,001 --> 02:20:56,480
No take me wrong.

3345
02:20:57,034 --> 02:20:58,035
That money.

3346
02:20:58,567 --> 02:21:00,012
I rolled that money.

3347
02:21:00,101 --> 02:21:02,581
What have you done? With whose
permission did you take that money?

3348
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,673
Oh my God what will I do now?

3349
02:21:04,767 --> 02:21:07,247
Don't worry money is not here now.

3350
02:21:07,667 --> 02:21:09,578
Only one hour is needed.

3351
02:21:09,734 --> 02:21:11,680
We will get the money, rightfathel'?

3352
02:21:12,034 --> 02:21:13,274
Yes, then what?

3353
02:21:13,567 --> 02:21:16,241
Son, it's not safe
to keep that money here.

3354
02:21:16,301 --> 02:21:18,372
Moreoverthere is
no use of it to anyone.

3355
02:21:18,467 --> 02:21:20,378
I have given it to our Thomas.

3356
02:21:20,634 --> 02:21:22,079
5 for 100 interests.

3357
02:21:22,301 --> 02:21:25,578
5 percent of 5 crore
means its 20 Iakhs.

3358
02:21:25,634 --> 02:21:29,241
Have you ever seen
5 crores and 20 Iakhs?

3359
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:31,507
This is one indecent
work that you have done.

3360
02:21:31,701 --> 02:21:33,339
Did you forget all that?

3361
02:21:33,434 --> 02:21:35,573
Do you remember the reason
why he is standing Iikethis here?

3362
02:21:36,001 --> 02:21:37,776
At time you go there
you will get it back.

3363
02:21:38,133 --> 02:21:40,443
- Then what?
- Still this is kind of cheating.

3364
02:21:40,634 --> 02:21:42,079
Don't fear son.

3365
02:21:42,433 --> 02:21:43,241
One day.

3366
02:21:43,467 --> 02:21:44,741
I will give backthe money tomorrow.

3367
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,412
One day? You said one hour'?

3368
02:21:48,367 --> 02:21:50,244
He trusted me and gave it.

3369
02:21:50,401 --> 02:21:51,641
Have some patience Raju.

3370
02:21:52,101 --> 02:21:53,478
You will get back the
money tomorrow itself.

3371
02:22:12,201 --> 02:22:13,236
Shavaliyar Sir.

3372
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:16,579
Yes Raju, sit.

3373
02:22:16,667 --> 02:22:17,236
No need.

3374
02:22:17,667 --> 02:22:20,307
I asked you to sit not
because of the respect on you.

3375
02:22:20,534 --> 02:22:22,377
Ifl keep looking up my neck hurts.

3376
02:22:22,467 --> 02:22:23,138
Sit.

3377
02:22:26,667 --> 02:22:27,771
Sahir sir.

3378
02:22:28,001 --> 02:22:30,379
Sahir sir had to
go to Mumbai urgently.

3379
02:22:30,633 --> 02:22:32,203
He had told Raju will come.

3380
02:22:32,500 --> 02:22:33,570
Sir.

3381
02:22:33,633 --> 02:22:34,577
Where is it?

3382
02:22:35,767 --> 02:22:36,711
Is it in vehicle?

3383
02:22:37,200 --> 02:22:37,701
Sir.

3384
02:22:38,100 --> 02:22:40,603
I haven't got the cash.

3385
02:22:41,167 --> 02:22:43,147
Key is with father.

3386
02:22:43,401 --> 02:22:44,436
He will be back tomorrow morning.

3387
02:22:44,601 --> 02:22:46,171
Once he reaches immediately
I will bring it to you.

3388
02:22:46,367 --> 02:22:47,573
That's okay.

3389
02:22:48,501 --> 02:22:51,141
You should tell Mani brother
not to delay any further.

3390
02:22:51,767 --> 02:22:53,769
Sahir sir is really in a lock.

3391
02:23:01,800 --> 02:23:03,279
- Hey Raju.
- Where are you going?

3392
02:23:03,367 --> 02:23:04,209
Start moving.

3393
02:23:04,567 --> 02:23:06,410
- Where?
- Move the vehicle.

3394
02:23:06,500 --> 02:23:09,037
- But where?
- Hey just move.

3395
02:23:10,134 --> 02:23:12,273
First when you hear you will feel bad.

3396
02:23:12,567 --> 02:23:15,013
You might even get angry.

3397
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:16,543
Maybe you might feel like killing me.

3398
02:23:18,167 --> 02:23:18,702
But.

3399
02:23:19,333 --> 02:23:21,142
You won't get that money for now.

3400
02:23:21,767 --> 02:23:23,542
Not that you won't get, I won't give.

3401
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:26,479
What did you say?
Do you know whose money is that?

3402
02:23:27,067 --> 02:23:28,740
What's there to know? It's Mani's.

3403
02:23:29,434 --> 02:23:32,506
There is no paper for
that money we both know it.

3404
02:23:32,700 --> 02:23:35,704
Meaning its proper black.

3405
02:23:36,134 --> 02:23:41,106
Mani has got around 200 crore of property if
he loses 4 in that it doesn't matter to him.

3406
02:23:41,267 --> 02:23:44,407
But for you to say 4 crore
you would need one whole life.

3407
02:23:44,734 --> 02:23:45,735
You.

3408
02:23:46,600 --> 02:23:49,513
Leave me boy, don't ever
think you will get back that money.

3409
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:52,976
Sometimes man has
to show unfaithfulness.

3410
02:23:53,267 --> 02:23:54,746
That's for his own goodness.

3411
02:23:55,034 --> 02:23:56,980
Sin of killing will
go once you eat it.

3412
02:23:57,167 --> 02:23:59,408
By cheating him ifl
am going to get some money.

3413
02:23:59,567 --> 02:24:01,444
If it's for my children's goodness.

3414
02:24:01,567 --> 02:24:03,274
I don't find any mistake in that.

3415
02:24:04,434 --> 02:24:05,742
See the vehicle came.

3416
02:24:08,333 --> 02:24:09,710
Don't go.

3417
02:24:10,234 --> 02:24:11,770
<i>Iwill</i> hold yourleg.

3418
02:24:12,267 --> 02:24:15,476
For God's sake don't do this to me.

3419
02:24:16,134 --> 02:24:18,307
Son in law, he is taking blessings.

3420
02:24:18,501 --> 02:24:20,242
Move son.

3421
02:24:20,601 --> 02:24:21,773
You.

3422
02:24:27,267 --> 02:24:32,046
"Without sucking milk,
I am feeling hungry"

3423
02:24:32,134 --> 02:24:36,207
"Breaking the peanuts
have to make food"

3424
02:24:37,301 --> 02:24:38,609
"Stomach"

3425
02:24:39,234 --> 02:24:41,111
- Hello sir.
- What's the matter'?

3426
02:24:41,467 --> 02:24:42,172
Where are you?

3427
02:24:42,267 --> 02:24:43,575
Iam here in Paadi.

3428
02:24:43,734 --> 02:24:44,576
What happened to you?

3429
02:24:45,234 --> 02:24:47,680
What? Nothing sir.

3430
02:24:48,100 --> 02:24:49,545
I had met doctor Vasudevan.

3431
02:24:49,733 --> 02:24:51,770
He told me everything,
what is this Mani?

3432
02:24:52,367 --> 02:24:55,246
Doctors just say something
and make usfear sir.

3433
02:24:55,534 --> 02:24:58,037
Our Lawrence brother
who never used to drink,

3434
02:24:58,134 --> 02:24:59,374
Died by losing his liver.

3435
02:24:59,567 --> 02:25:02,605
Our Kochi Haneefa brother who has
never sniffed the smell of alcohol,

3436
02:25:02,734 --> 02:25:03,712
Also died of losing liver.

3437
02:25:03,800 --> 02:25:06,474
For now you shift your stay to Cochin.

3438
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:08,240
Take a flat or villa.

3439
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:10,645
Not for anything else,

3440
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:12,374
You used to say about
a tendency right?

3441
02:25:12,600 --> 02:25:14,773
Forthat not to happen
your drinking tendency.

3442
02:25:15,067 --> 02:25:17,047
It's not such a big problem sir.

3443
02:25:17,234 --> 02:25:18,645
I will take my controlling power.

3444
02:25:18,767 --> 02:25:21,145
So you won't shift to Cochin?

3445
02:25:21,267 --> 02:25:24,214
Oh will I be without
listening to you sir?

3446
02:25:25,367 --> 02:25:27,176
Moving from one nest to another.

3447
02:25:28,067 --> 02:25:29,603
Let me see a good house.

3448
02:25:29,767 --> 02:25:32,043
Okay, be careful.

3449
02:25:32,267 --> 02:25:33,211
Okay sir.

3450
02:25:48,734 --> 02:25:51,271
Raju, Raj-u-

3451
02:26:13,367 --> 02:26:15,404
Oh okay.

3452
02:26:16,234 --> 02:26:17,372
Why did you hide the bottle?

3453
02:26:17,800 --> 02:26:21,270
You said no one will drink,
but you can drink right?

3454
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:24,040
What is it?

3455
02:26:24,433 --> 02:26:25,173
Nothing.

3456
02:26:26,200 --> 02:26:27,406
Did you give money to Sakir?

3457
02:26:28,201 --> 02:26:29,202
Yes, I gave.

3458
02:26:29,633 --> 02:26:31,044
What did he say?

3459
02:26:31,534 --> 02:26:34,208
Nothing,
I have to see someone urgently.

3460
02:26:34,400 --> 02:26:35,435
I am a little busy.

3461
02:26:36,433 --> 02:26:37,776
What happened to him?

3462
02:26:38,567 --> 02:26:39,978
Did he drink so much?

3463
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:47,110
Hey waiter.

3464
02:26:55,667 --> 02:26:58,580
It's a good feeling
to drive without drinking.

3465
02:27:01,600 --> 02:27:02,510
That's Raju right?

3466
02:27:02,600 --> 02:27:04,409
What is he doing?

3467
02:27:05,267 --> 02:27:06,405
Stop, SfOP-

3468
02:27:07,800 --> 02:27:10,076
Is he raping the bike?

3469
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:18,635
Hey Raju.

3470
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:20,143
What is this buffalo?

3471
02:27:20,267 --> 02:27:21,610
What happened? Get up

3472
02:27:21,767 --> 02:27:23,144
- Vehicle's.
- Vehicle's?

3473
02:27:23,301 --> 02:27:24,541
Vehicle's petrol got over.

3474
02:27:24,667 --> 02:27:26,078
Not because vehicle's petrol got over.

3475
02:27:26,134 --> 02:27:27,374
Because the petrol
you drank is too much.

3476
02:27:27,600 --> 02:27:29,546
What are you thinking?
If Mani gets to know.

3477
02:27:30,167 --> 02:27:31,441
Looking at this even he will start.

3478
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:33,035
Hold him.

3479
02:27:34,167 --> 02:27:35,737
Put him in vehicle.

3480
02:27:37,334 --> 02:27:38,074
Hey Ramu.

3481
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:39,743
Go dunk him in water for some time.

3482
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:40,740
Nonsense fellow.

3483
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:42,343
Hold him.

3484
02:27:42,567 --> 02:27:44,103
Get down.

3485
02:27:44,567 --> 02:27:45,511
Get down.

3486
02:27:49,467 --> 02:27:51,447
Go give him bath,
onlythen he will be fine.

3487
02:27:51,567 --> 02:27:52,773
Just dunk him and bring.

3488
02:27:53,467 --> 02:27:54,275
He has got from me.

3489
02:27:54,401 --> 02:27:56,540
- Mani.
- Mani, everything is okay.

3490
02:27:56,633 --> 02:27:58,203
The Coimbatore guys
will come next week.

3491
02:27:59,067 --> 02:28:00,045
Where did he go?

3492
02:28:00,634 --> 02:28:02,113
- Mani.
- Mani. He is not here.

3493
02:28:05,501 --> 02:28:06,411
Is he not there?

3494
02:28:07,634 --> 02:28:10,171
He is not here, maybe he is outhouse.

3495
02:28:10,434 --> 02:28:12,778
Dunk, dunk properly.

3496
02:28:16,034 --> 02:28:17,570
Yes once more.

3497
02:28:26,100 --> 02:28:27,170
Is your hangover gone?

3498
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:31,581
We all decided not to drink right?

3499
02:28:31,767 --> 02:28:33,678
But now you alone.

3500
02:28:36,300 --> 02:28:37,404
I did a mistake.

3501
02:28:38,734 --> 02:28:40,680
You forgive me.

3502
02:28:46,501 --> 02:28:47,980
Don't cry.

3503
02:28:49,267 --> 02:28:50,245
Mani.

3504
02:28:51,067 --> 02:28:52,239
Why is he sleeping here?

3505
02:28:53,034 --> 02:28:54,138
- Mani.
- Hey Mani.

3506
02:28:54,300 --> 02:28:55,574
Why are you sleeping here?

3507
02:28:56,267 --> 02:28:57,405
- Mani.
- Hey Mani.

3508
02:28:57,534 --> 02:28:59,013
Hey you drank?

3509
02:28:59,500 --> 02:29:01,446
What have you done?

3510
02:29:02,067 --> 02:29:03,705
Everything was just becoming okay.

3511
02:29:04,167 --> 02:29:06,408
No,just a small one.

3512
02:29:06,501 --> 02:29:08,708
- Too much of tendency.
- What tendency?

3513
02:29:08,767 --> 02:29:10,246
First take care of your health Mani.

3514
02:29:10,301 --> 02:29:12,542
Only if you are there we are there.

3515
02:29:12,700 --> 02:29:14,304
No, I.

3516
02:29:15,001 --> 02:29:16,776
I feel like got some energy.

3517
02:29:17,267 --> 02:29:20,407
From some days have
been without drinking.

3518
02:29:21,334 --> 02:29:24,440
I became alert now.

3519
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:26,579
Leave m e.

3520
02:29:27,001 --> 02:29:28,742
- Leave me.
- What is he doing?

3521
02:29:29,034 --> 02:29:32,675
This drink is something
which creates energy.

3522
02:29:33,234 --> 02:29:35,771
But it should go more
that's the only thing.

3523
02:29:36,033 --> 02:29:38,035
Oh okay so you have
no plans of stopping it.

3524
02:29:38,134 --> 02:29:38,703
Where?

3525
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:41,542
If he had plans to stop will he
come here sneaking from us and drink?

3526
02:29:42,467 --> 02:29:43,411
No.

3527
02:29:43,534 --> 02:29:44,706
Today one day.

3528
02:29:45,433 --> 02:29:48,277
A celebration then I won't touch it.

3529
02:29:48,534 --> 02:29:53,210
Its Mani's word,
you must call all our buddies.

3530
02:29:54,167 --> 02:29:54,702
Mani.

3531
02:29:55,233 --> 02:29:58,214
Promise right?
You will stop from today?

3532
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,138
If you love me,

3533
02:30:01,400 --> 02:30:02,743
Keep your hand on my head and promise.

3534
02:30:03,034 --> 02:30:04,445
Promise.

3535
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:08,708
You reached, come soon and
start cooking it's getting late.

3536
02:30:09,034 --> 02:30:09,774
Hey Jose.

3537
02:30:10,300 --> 02:30:13,076
Your enthusiasm towards
these bottles is only for today.

3538
02:30:13,267 --> 02:30:14,245
It's not there from tomorrow.

3539
02:30:14,367 --> 02:30:16,574
This is an interior decoration Sukhu.

3540
02:30:16,667 --> 02:30:20,080
Decoration, decorating using
toddy bottles will stop from today.

3541
02:30:20,134 --> 02:30:22,239
Stop and don't make tendency in him.

3542
02:30:22,434 --> 02:30:23,174
For me too.

3543
02:30:23,400 --> 02:30:25,209
- Yes.
-lt's for you too.

3544
02:30:46,234 --> 02:30:47,577
Why didn't you bring the cash Raju?

3545
02:30:47,634 --> 02:30:50,706
- Money, Mani had to roll it over.
- You should have informed me that.

3546
02:30:51,167 --> 02:30:52,646
He is inside right?

3547
02:30:53,500 --> 02:30:55,571
But no, sir.

3548
02:31:03,167 --> 02:31:07,377
"Cuckoo which sings the sweet song"

3549
02:31:07,601 --> 02:31:12,072

"Why so soon you have gone so far?"

3552
02:31:21,134 --> 02:31:25,378
"You are the shadow
of love in my eyes"

3553
02:31:25,601 --> 02:31:30,175
"Shall I sing today remem bering you?"

3554

3559
02:32:17,667 --> 02:32:22,116
"Will become the start
that comes tonight"

3560
02:32:22,301 --> 02:32:31,483
"To be born here and sing more I
will wait for any number of lives too"

3561
02:32:33,234 --> 02:32:35,578
If a 200 ml alcohol enters his body.

3562
02:32:35,734 --> 02:32:38,237
In this situation anything can happen.

3563

"The footprints fallen on this mud
will become unforgettable memories"
