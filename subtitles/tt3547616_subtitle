1
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:05,299
There's a restless
desire..in my hean.

2
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:09,130
"O Lord.."

3
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:12,970
"O Lord.."

4
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:20,242
"Give me some refuge."

5
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:23,946
"O Lord..bless me with your grace."

6
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:27,388
"..and unite me with my desires."

7
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:31,619
"Unite me."

8
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,968
"Give me pain..and relief too."

9
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:52,512
"Bless me with courage."

10
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:56,319
"O Lord..bless me with your grace."

11
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,980
"..and unite me with my desires."

12
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:04,152
"Unite me."

13
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:06,722
Mister, can I be of some service?

14
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,228
You know no one buys your bread.

15
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,995
Please lease this place to my brother.

16
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:15,128
At least we'll get some rent.

17
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,640
Again you mentioned
about your brother.

18
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,073
I don't want to sell this bakery.

19
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:19,939
I'm fed-up of you and your bakery.

20
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,275
No need to go out and work.

21
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,973
Why do you keep talking
about it all the time?

22
00:03:24,137 --> 00:03:25,207
What else do you want?

23
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:26,477
We should continue living like this?

24
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,574
We have only one son.

25
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:30,553
And he's turning into one of us.
- What's this nonsense?

26
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:32,145
Always on the guitar.

27
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,350
I am tired of listening to it.

28
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,119
What are you doing?
- The bakery's isn't doing well..

29
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,717
...and your mother
keeps arguing with me.

30
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:43,692
"All my refuge are lonely."

31
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:50,438
"l couldn't get a moment of relief."

32
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:57,106
"My loneliness follows me
around like a shadow.

33
00:03:57,337 --> 00:04:00,750
O Lord.."""

34
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,487
"O Lord.."

35
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,282
"Either you make me..or break me."

36
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,987
"l'm Your devotee..you decide."

37
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,430
"O Lord..bless me with your grace."

38
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:19,193
"..and unite me with my desires."

39
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:22,329
"Unite me."

40
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,268
'Some people run after dreams..'

41
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,279
'..because they want to fulfill it.'

42
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:32,141
'But some people run after dreams..'

43
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,741
'..because they're running
from their reality.'

44
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,822
'And you want to stan
all over again far away.'

45
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,625
'So far..where there are
no traces of your past life.'

46
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,287
'And while doing that.'

47
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,126
'..you don't realize whether
you're doing wrong or right.'

48
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,559
'You simply run away..'

49
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,292
'..from your parents.'

50
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,343
My hean has been stolen,
what do I do now?

51
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,249
Yeah.. Yes.

52
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:13,690
Mr. Dhingra.

53
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,057
Come, come..sit. - Good morning.

54
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:23,665
How is it? How is it?

55
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:25,399
It really hit me hard.

56
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,867
What? - Nice, sir. It's really nice.

57
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,266
It's bound to be nice.

58
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:36,178
You see..Pappi Singh is not a singer.

59
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,115
I keep saying the same thing.

60
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:43,552
He's a brand. - You're right, sir.

61
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,225
If a underwear seller doesn't
have a catchy name for his product.

62
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,157
...no one's going
to wear his underwear.

63
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,091
These days even underwear
has catchy names.

64
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:53,696
"Petrol..Diesel..CNG!"

65
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,561
Like you're wearing
an entire petrol pump.

66
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:57,392
Correct. Correct.

67
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:03,505
Take my advice..and turn yourself
into some brand. - Right.

68
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,836
I've heard your voice.

69
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,174
It's filled with emotions.

70
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,712
I'm giving you a chance
because you're talented.

71
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:15,142
Arrange for the money..and
we'll stan work.

72
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,584
Money?

73
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:21,916
You'll be investing the money,
boy, not me.

74
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,183
I only give my label.

75
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,787
King Audio!

76
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,160
Get the money and we'll start.

77
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:31,426
Go on..go!

78
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:39,870
Just a minute. - It's okay.

79
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,290
Hi, Ronny.

80
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,757
Hi, Nimmi.
Where were you from four days?

81
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:07,560
Two maninis.

82
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,834
Remember what happened the last time.

83
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:11,432
...when you had two together?

84
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,768
You won't have to carry me today.

85
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,412
I am here with someone.

86
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,751
Where did you find this nutcase?

87
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,552
Mom-dad found him.

88
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:29,953
...for my marriage!

89
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,763
He lives in Australia. And he's rich.

90
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,599
Good!

91
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,734
Good?

92
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,467
Do you realize..l am
marrying him next week

93
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,407
Can you imagine that?

94
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,510
Next week?

95
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,248
Hello..you're not jealous at all?

96
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,208
What kind of guy is this man,
like seriously!

97
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,452
Look, I've told you before. - I know.

98
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,816
You don't believe in marriages.
you'll never get married..

99
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,621
...you want to concentrate
on your careerblah-blah.

100
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,217
Thank you very much
for reminding me that.

101
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,688
You're welcome.

102
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:08,825
You know what, I am leaving.

103
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:10,961
You can keep your non-commitment.

104
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,329
...no-relation,
no-marriage attitude to yourself.

105
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,368
And sleep with this guitar each night.

106
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,272
Cheers.

107
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,385
I ordered that drink
for my would-be husband.

108
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:30,583
Sorry, my mistake.

109
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:31,983
It's not a mistake, lnder.

110
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,451
It's a sign.

111
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,022
My dreams..my desires.

112
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,860
...will come true.

113
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:48,435
Nimmi..Be Positive,
The SecreLLinda Goodman..

114
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:51,366
Reading these books
are not going to help you.

115
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,238
Marriage is a horrible thing.

116
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:56,436
But..it's your life,
do whatever you want.

117
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,516
Just go to hell, lnder.

118
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,686
Hey..Nimmi!

119
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:10,354
Hello.

120
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:11,655
Good day, mister.

121
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,721
Myself, Advocate Kanar
Singh Chima from Kasoli.

122
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,560
Yes?

123
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:18,631
Well, actually I wanted
to give you a small trouble.

124
00:09:19,191 --> 00:09:23,867
Your dear father, the very
respected Mr. Bhajanlal Bhalla..

125
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:29,476
...Is tired of working
hard..and wants to retire.

126
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:31,410
It's his life,
he can do anything he likes with it.

127
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,514
Wonderful!

128
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,209
What a great son Mr. Bhalla has.

129
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:36,318
Super!

130
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,148
But the problem is that the bakery..

131
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,255
...Is on your ancestral land.

132
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,593
And your grandfather
willed this land..

133
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,595
...to you and your father.

134
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,225
So?

135
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,867
So the point is you'll
have to come down to India once.

136
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,464
Once you sign on the Bakery papers..

137
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,332
...your father can take
his share and rest easy.

138
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,337
And you can take your
share and have a ball.

139
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:58,909
Right.

140
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:01,576
He's very stubborn.
He won't come.

141
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,269
He will never come.

142
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,243
I am stubbormand he's
flexible like rubber band.

143
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,941
Look, I am not interested.

144
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,446
You can give him my share too.

145
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,915
What are you doing?

146
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,452
Fortune's ready to smile on you..

147
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:14,581
...and you want to wash your face.

148
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,954
Leave for India tomorrow.

149
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,558
No one's lending us money anyway.

150
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:20,353
L..can't go to India.

151
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:22,865
What's the problem
in going there once?

152
00:10:23,222 --> 00:10:25,259
It's been 10 years since I left home..

153
00:10:26,892 --> 00:10:27,927
Earlier I would talk to my mother.

154
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,265
But I haven't talked to
her either for the past few years.

155
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,978
You know..you don't
have to see your father.

156
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:40,809
Just go home..take your
share..and back to pavilion!

157
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,289
I knew it.

158
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,188
I knew you can't live without me.

159
00:10:50,349 --> 00:10:52,556
I knew you would come
to the airpon to stop me.

160
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:53,620
Let me guess.

161
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:56,292
Nimmi..please
don't go..and all that.

162
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,729
Enough, Nimmi.

163
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,361
I am going to India
for some official work.

164
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,899
Wow..what will you call it now?

165
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:08,707
Coincidence..or sign?

166
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:11,377
Look, lnder.

167
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,848
We decided we'll never meet again.

168
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,817
And I never told you
that I am going to India.

169
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,186
So?

170
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,448
You will call-off my wedding,
I know it.

171
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,651
But on a serious note, lnder..

172
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,123
Don't make me elope with you..

173
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,925
...when I'm decked up in
the bridal dress and jewelry.

174
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,927
It'll be really difficult to run..
What say?

175
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:32,258
Inder?

176
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,864
Inder?

177
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:39,900
Son, an Indian always
helps another Indian.

178
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,905
Will you help me? - Of course, aunty.

179
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,945
Your uncle and I got separate seats.

180
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:49,945
And between us..
we've only one denture.

181
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,415
Where is it?

182
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,755
No, no..no.!

183
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,223
Uncle? - He's right there.

184
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,393
What happened?

185
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,904
Well..you see aunty..

186
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,731
...an Indian doesn't
always help another Indian.

187
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:11,739
Goodnight!

188
00:12:17,703 --> 00:12:19,705
Inder! lnder!

189
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,879
Look what I brought.

190
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:25,519
My son's a graduate now.
He has completed his graduation.

191
00:12:25,544 --> 00:12:26,522
Inder, come down.

192
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,388
Let's put up this board.

193
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,254
I don't want to work in your bakery.

194
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,760
What kind of a son is he!
He refused to work at the bakery!

195
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:35,491
What is it, Mr. Bhalla?
Did he disappoint you?

196
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:40,264
What do you want to do?

197
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,497
What do you want to do in life?

198
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:44,572
I don't want to live in this country.

199
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,902
I want to go abroad.

200
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:46,972
What's he saying?

201
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:48,607
He sounds like those
people are waiting for you..

202
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:50,271
“With a Welcome' board.

203
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,576
Ronnie's papa is letting him go,
what's your problem?

204
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,583
He's going to Bangkok.

205
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:57,743
Your friend Randeep's
going really far.

206
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,788
We'll have to begin from somewhere.

207
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:00,855
But.

208
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:03,415
I told you he doesn't
want to give me money.

209
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,486
Why don't you give him the money?

210
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,961
Fine..shake that tree outside.

211
00:13:09,355 --> 00:13:10,698
And take all the money
that falls from it.

212
00:13:10,856 --> 00:13:12,733
You weren't born with a silver-spoon!

213
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,465
Then what are you for?

214
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,000
Why give binh to
me in the first place?

215
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,672
Look son..take my advice.

216
00:13:22,268 --> 00:13:23,941
We'll run the bakery together.

217
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:27,377
All you do is squat
flies all day at the bakery.

218
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,711
I want to do something with
my life..l want to be someone.

219
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,813
You sound as if we haven't
done anything with our lives.

220
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,816
Yes..you've done a lot.

221
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,489
You're good for nothing.

222
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:38,960
Son.. - Loser!

223
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:41,962
What are you doing?

224
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,933
How dare you argue with your father!

225
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,428
Have you ever acted like a father?

226
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:50,368
Did you ever ask me what I want,
what I thought?

227
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,501
Every father is a hero for his child.

228
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,038
The child is always assured..

229
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,373
...that no matter what,
his father's there.

230
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,841
But you are my problem!

231
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:01,849
I see..

232
00:14:02,808 --> 00:14:04,310
Fine, I am your problem.

233
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,320
Get out of my house.

234
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,348
And don't come back..

235
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,550
...until you don't make
something of yourself.

236
00:14:08,647 --> 00:14:09,489
Get out!

237
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,495
What are you saying? - Be quiet.

238
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,624
Inder, stop.

239
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,662
What are you doing, son?

240
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,497
Didn't I tell you, mom..

241
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:26,310
...someday he'll throw me
out just like my guitar. - No.

242
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:31,003
Let me go, mom. - Stop..lnder!

243
00:14:47,253 --> 00:14:47,697
Nimmi.

244
00:14:47,786 --> 00:14:50,232
Nimmi, did you board the plane?
- Board?

245
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:51,995
The plane's already landed, papa.

246
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:53,032
Land?

247
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,770
You were supposed to arrive at 8pm,
but landed at 8am instead?

248
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,501
You're too much, papa.
You blundered again.

249
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:59,439
Stay there,
I'll send a car to the airport.

250
00:14:59,498 --> 00:14:59,999
Get the car.

251
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,643
If you send a car now,
we'll be wasting a lot of time.

252
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,409
It's okay. - I'll take a taxi.

253
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:05,538
But. - It's okay, papa.

254
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,513
Okay, bye.

255
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,015
She has arrived.

256
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,878
Since you're here, why don't
you attend my wedding as well?

257
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,313
You sing well.

258
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,790
If you perform at my ceremonies,
you can make some money as well.

259
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,525
Come on.

260
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:19,858
Your hean might melt..when
you see me in the bridal dress.

261
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,833
Goodbye..Ms. Nimmi!

262
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,670
May your wedding be a pleasant one!

263
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:32,737
You go your way, and I go my way.

264
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,939
"O companiomjust a little longer."

265
00:15:50,482 --> 00:15:59,368
The destination of
love's calling out to thee.

266
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,105
Gurdaspur. - Kasoli.

267
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,843
Why are you after me?

268
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,749
Chill. I'll take another cab.

269
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:17,046
No, no, sir.

270
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,419
Gurdaspur is on the way.

271
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,489
We can drop her on the
way and continue to Kasoli.

272
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,527
You see..this way I'll get two fares.

273
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:34,427
"You're the one..l prayed for."

274
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:44,412
Taking a single step
without you..is impossible.

275
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,876
Madam..your stop is here.

276
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,523
Lefs go. - 0K8'!-

277
00:16:55,748 --> 00:17:04,634
"O companiomjust a little longer."

278
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:14,845
The destination of
love's calling out to thee.

279
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,833
Well..you're on a suicide path.

280
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:40,902
So..good luck.

281
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,269
Please fulfill my
last wish before I die.

282
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,972
How about you give me
a biscuit from your bakery?

283
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,442
You know..it's a four hour journey.

284
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,377
And I'll even take
your parents' blessings.

285
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:51,879
Blessings?

286
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,384
Once you meet them.

287
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,450
...It will shatter all
your illusions about marriage.

288
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:58,982
Most welcome.

289
00:17:59,344 --> 00:18:01,722
Come. - Sir..are you lnder Bhalla?

290
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,050
Foreign return?

291
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,320
Yes.

292
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,396
You see..your father is
at the lawyer's place.

293
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,793
And he's called you there too.

294
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:10,898
And the lawyer has
even sent a car for you.

295
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:11,729
Come.

296
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,932
Sister-in-law, you too.

297
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,937
"Oh my baby doll of gold..."

298
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,410
You're a bloody good for nothing,
loser.

299
00:18:29,508 --> 00:18:31,078
Get out of my house. Get out.

300
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,588
Advocate Chima.

301
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,019
Welcome, mister. Welcome.

302
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,729
Welcome, lnder. Come.

303
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:41,830
Come, sit.

304
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:44,997
Take a seat. Don't be shy.

305
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:47,929
Sister-in-law is with you too.

306
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,338
Come on. Sit down.

307
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,738
See, Mr. Bhalla,
finally they are here.

308
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:58,981
Sign here..and make
your father sign here.

309
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,953
What's this? - What's this?

310
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,588
It's an invitation
to my tonsuring ceremony.

311
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:08,086
What a joke.

312
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:10,150
These are the papers
to your father's bakery.

313
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,654
Your father borrowed
a huge sum from me.

314
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,025
And now I've to borrow
money from other people.

315
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:23,664
Your father's borrowed money
from everyone in the village.

316
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,467
Even ATM machines
refuse to give him money.

317
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:28,643
Look..l've a complete list.

318
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:33,072
2 million..with interest.

319
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,710
2 million.

320
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,980
Give me the Bakery..scores settled.

321
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:40,818
I came here to take
my share of the money.

322
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:41,983
Exactly.

323
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:43,617
I put out a bait and you came running.

324
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,527
Had he been getting his share..

325
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:48,529
...he would've been overwhelmed.

326
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:51,161
Your father's left
you debt as inheritance.

327
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,068
So you will have to pay up.

328
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,804
Sign on the papers..and
make your father sign as well.

329
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,001
His sign doesn't matter.

330
00:20:00,465 --> 00:20:01,910
I am not going to
sign in the first place.

331
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:02,976
Bloody old man..

332
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:05,709
Chima, my home's above the bakery.

333
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,408
If I sell it, where will I live?

334
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,783
Your son's come down from abroad.

335
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:12,613
He'll take you back with him.

336
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:14,715
He won't take me anywhere.

337
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:17,158
And I won't go with him either.

338
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:19,893
Son.. him?

339
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:25,764
You see..you two have one day.

340
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:29,437
I'll come home..to taste
sister-in-laws cooking.

341
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:34,606
Either you pay my 2
million..or give me the bakery.

342
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:37,813
And if you don't settle
this account tomorrow..

343
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,249
"Then I'll put you two in
your bakery's furnace.

344
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:46,189
...and make bread.

345
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,828
Careful..you fool.

346
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:55,888
Careful.

347
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:57,892
Even/thing's still the same.

348
00:20:58,457 --> 00:20:59,663
Same old broken roads.

349
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,669
Same old din and
filth..same old people.

350
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:02,768
Look there.

351
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,839
That dog's been peeing
there for the last 10 years.

352
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:07,301
At least he's loyal.

353
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,870
He's lazy, not loyal.

354
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:12,542
He's stuck at the
same place for 10 years.

355
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:14,515
I would be rotting here too.

356
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:16,712
Yes, of course. He's the
only one who's been successful.

357
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,354
That's why he came down for his share.

358
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:19,513
Nonsense.

359
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,885
Tell him..there are no goons after me.

360
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,485
2 million in debts.

361
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,457
What was the reason
to borrow so much money?

362
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:29,097
And even if he did..

363
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,394
People always keep aside some savings.

364
00:21:31,556 --> 00:21:33,058
I did do some savings. I did too.

365
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:34,994
I kept giving that
money to his mother.

366
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:37,598
And his mother used
to make jewelry out of it..

367
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,902
...so that it'll come
in handy someday.

368
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:39,805
Tell him that.

369
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:42,570
Ask him..where's the jewelry?

370
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:44,745
Did he put them in
the oven and make biscuits?

371
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:49,114
Tell him..his mother kept all
the jewelry at his uncle's place.

372
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,581
Because she didn't trust me.

373
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:56,784
Ask him..why doesn't he tell
mother to get those jewelry back?

374
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,795
I can't tell her that.
Tell him, daughter-in-law.

375
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:01,558
Tell him..you're not
his daughter-in-law.

376
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,729
I am not your daughter-in-law. - Fine.

377
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,030
You're not my daughter-in-law,
good for you.

378
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,669
You should thank God for it.

379
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,502
Stop, the bakery's here. - Fine, fine.

380
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,734
Will you take us to the border?

381
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,902
Come on.

382
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,881
How much? - 3550 rupees.

383
00:22:19,738 --> 00:22:20,978
What? - Yes, sir.

384
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:22,942
He hasn't paid my fare
for the last 5 years.

385
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,043
Put it on my tab.

386
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,414
No more nonsense from you. Come on.

387
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,516
What a man. - l'll..

388
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,625
Uncle, let me take that.
- It's alright, dear.

389
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,962
Come on.

390
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,556
Yes, papa?

391
00:22:37,622 --> 00:22:39,568
Dear, it's almost evening..and
you're not home yet.

392
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:41,466
Yes, I'm a bit late.

393
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,095
How late?

394
00:22:42,127 --> 00:22:43,538
I'll come tomorrow morning.

395
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:44,163
Where will you stay?

396
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:49,503
I'll stay with my friend..lnder.
- lnder?

397
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:51,511
Fine, dear.

398
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:52,547
Okay, papa. Bye.

399
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:59,946
Are you and lnder just friends,
or.. - Well, l..

400
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:02,786
On, <i>l</i> get n.
lnder's the one saying no.

401
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,622
Hopeless boy.

402
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:05,423
Come.

403
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,569
'Why don't you put
him in some good school?'

404
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,046
'Why don't you understand,
I don't have the kind of money..'

405
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,475
'Then let him stay with my brother..'

406
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,313
'Don't talk about your brother,
or else I will beat you.'

407
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:29,977
'Don't touch me.'

408
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,021
Don't you dare take his name. -
So why don't you..

409
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,556
'I'll slap you.'

410
00:23:35,814 --> 00:23:42,356
Do you know three-lettered word for
"Aascharya, Achambit" (Astonishment).

411
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,596
AMAZE. - Where's mother?

412
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,672
No, not AMAZE. In Hindi.

413
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:51,964
Sorry, uncle.

414
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,109
Ask him where's mom.

415
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,746
She's at the Old Age Home.

416
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,648
What?

417
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:03,012
She's been sick for
the past couple of years..

418
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,678
...so she's at the
Old Age Home. - Sick?

419
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,351
If she's sick,
she should be at the hospital.

420
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:08,356
Why the Old Age Home?

421
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:15,362
Are you going to say something or not?

422
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,657
There are no big hospitals here.

423
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:18,800
There's just one Old Age Home..

424
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,061
...where people with
such conditions are treated.

425
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,095
What "Condition"?

426
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,218
Alzheimer's is most hereditary.

427
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,547
At first, the patient
begins to forget small things.

428
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:17,420
Like namesmames
of things used daily.

429
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,424
Then slowly..she
gets morose at nature.

430
00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:22,926
The patient doesn't
realize this himself.

431
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:25,827
But yes..if someone pays attention.

432
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:28,966
"Then it can be detected
at an early stage.

433
00:25:30,662 --> 00:25:32,164
It's really strange.

434
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,439
...that no one at your
home detected these symptoms.

435
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:43,378
Well..my papa and mom don't get along.

436
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:44,843
And you?

437
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,524
Isn't there a cure, doctor?

438
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,389
Well, there is no cure.

439
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,501
"But we can slow down the process.

440
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,636
The patient needs to
be given medicine on time.

441
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,533
And most imponantly.

442
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,632
...the patient needs a good ambience.

443
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,935
And she needs to be
kept happy at every cost.

444
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,237
Can I take mom home?

445
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:25,288
Welcome, mister.

446
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,288
Wakeup, Bhalla.

447
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:33,531
Look..this time you two
get straight to the point.

448
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:35,362
I don't want any
lengthy conversations.

449
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,480
Did you sign or not?

450
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,850
Why did you bring her here?

451
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,748
Did you take the
biscuits out of the oven?

452
00:26:57,215 --> 00:26:58,250
They will get burnt.

453
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,388
Why did you bring her here?

454
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,622
Don't worry.

455
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,625
I will look after mom.

456
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:05,631
You will look after her? You?

457
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:07,829
Will you take her along?
- Isn't that what you want?

458
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,567
That's one burden off your shoulders.

459
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,234
Happy? - Enough! Shut up! Shut up!

460
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,410
You two are more like Wildcats
rather than a father and son.

461
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,839
Always fighting.

462
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,643
The point is..your
father hasn't signed yet.

463
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:20,978
And I never will.

464
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,480
Look here.. - Forget it. I won't sign.

465
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:24,643
I don't want to sign.

466
00:27:24,676 --> 00:27:26,349
Nimmi, why don't
you and mom sit outside?

467
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:27,354
You cannot force me.

468
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,890
Hey..no one's going anywhere.

469
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,822
Sit here.

470
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,690
Be quiet.

471
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:31,487
Sit here.

472
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:32,760
You're too much.

473
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:33,886
Or I will shoot.

474
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,954
What do you mean you'll shoot?

475
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:38,359
Chima, listen to me.

476
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:39,963
I've already signed the papers.

477
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,066
I don't care how you'll
extract the money from him.

478
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:42,862
Get it.

479
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,405
I know how.

480
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:45,903
Bhalla..come on, sign.

481
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:46,941
What are you doing?

482
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,306
Lower the gun.

483
00:27:48,366 --> 00:27:49,344
I'm saving--

484
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,037
What's wrong?

485
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,611
I've told you a thousand
times..grease this thing.

486
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,714
Never fires when you want it to.

487
00:27:56,274 --> 00:27:57,048
Oh god, it fired!

488
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:09,331
The gun fired.

489
00:28:14,926 --> 00:28:17,566
Look, Chima..relax.

490
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,604
We have some jewelry.

491
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:22,773
It's not here, it's someplace else.

492
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:24,914
It's with our uncle Kripal.

493
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,507
What uncle?

494
00:28:26,671 --> 00:28:29,413
We've an uncle who
lives close to Chandigarh.

495
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,944
Give me his number.

496
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,783
Hold it.
- Wait, I'll give you his number.

497
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:34,046
<i>Boss.</i>

498
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,359
Boss..there's no
balance in your phone.

499
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:41,624
Okay, dial this number.

500
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,398
You fool..-981..

501
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:45,662
You call him.

502
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:46,861
Why? - Why should we call him?

503
00:28:47,092 --> 00:28:47,968
I won't waste any more money.

504
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,629
What a miser!

505
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,133
There..it's ringing.

506
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:52,771
Talk to him. - What will I say?

507
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,105
We don't get along.

508
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:56,572
You talk to him.

509
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,109
Put it on speaker.

510
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,847
Hello.

511
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,487
The serpent.

512
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:09,147
Hello, uncle, it's lnder speaking.

513
00:29:09,447 --> 00:29:12,087
Inder? lnder who?

514
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,523
Oh..Bhalla's son.

515
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,892
Finally you called, huh!

516
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:20,662
No, aunty.
I called because I was missing you.

517
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,700
You forgot all about us.

518
00:29:22,794 --> 00:29:27,004
And now you finally
remembered about us.

519
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,167
Get to the point.

520
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:29,667
Where's uncle?

521
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,806
Uncle's gone for a long drive.

522
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:33,881
When will he return?

523
00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:37,552
We just bought a
new Mercedes yesterday.

524
00:29:37,675 --> 00:29:38,483
Mercedes!

525
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,486
That rascal Kirpal must have sold
my jewels and bought the Mercedes.

526
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,024
I know your uncle too well.

527
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:45,155
I said take me along as well.

528
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:49,159
After all I am your wife.
Let me sit in the Mercedes as well.

529
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:51,562
Fine, aunty. I am hanging up.

530
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,665
Listen up. You two leave right now.

531
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:55,003
And come back only with the jewelry.

532
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,070
And if you don't get the jewelry,
get the Mercedes instead.

533
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:59,700
Wow! That's great.

534
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:02,875
Thank you. - Okay, fine.

535
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:04,036
Come, mom.

536
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,705
Nimmi..l'll drop you on the way.

537
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,008
Sit. Sit. Sit.

538
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:13,647
What if the entire family
disappears after getting the jewelry?

539
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:16,549
You expect me to beg outside
the temple for the rest of my life?

540
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,759
Aunty and sister-in-law
are going to stay with us.

541
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:21,657
What?

542
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:23,698
And if you miss them.

543
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:24,789
Give me your phone.

544
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,629
But.

545
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:31,499
If you want to talk to your mom,
just call.

546
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:35,975
Go on.

547
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,171
Let's go have a pastry.

548
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,373
Walk faster.

549
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:44,113
Isn't there a way to
the bakery from inside? - Yes.

550
00:30:44,442 --> 00:30:44,943
Come on.

551
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,179
You, wipe my face.

552
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,456
I'll show you. How dare you
give a bad name to Kasol!

553
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:52,558
I will set you straight.

554
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,462
Welcome, Mr. Bhalla.

555
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:57,426
You could've at least
spared the police.

556
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:58,798
Now you want to borrow
money from us as well.

557
00:30:58,890 --> 00:30:59,994
Have some shame.

558
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,870
Look, I am lnder Bhalla.

559
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:06,007
Chima and his goons have
barged in our house. - I see..

560
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,677
Fine then, keep him there.

561
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:11,144
The minister's visiting today.

562
00:31:11,502 --> 00:31:13,743
It's best he doesn't
come anywhere close to him.

563
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,110
Just entertain him in any way you can.

564
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,812
Don't let him out.
Okay.

565
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:22,180
See..that's Law and Order.

566
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,191
Foreign returned!

567
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:30,898
If you have any
problemsspeak out now.

568
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:34,835
Sir..a gangster called Chima
has made my life difficult.

569
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:35,902
Chima?

570
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,938
He lends money and
charges 35% interest.

571
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:42,672
I couldn't pay him back,
and he seized all my lands.

572
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,541
I am ruined.

573
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:55,486
Stop. Stop.

574
00:31:58,316 --> 00:31:59,317
Put it on my tab.

575
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,494
Jai Hind.

576
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,295
Bravo.

577
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,625
Where are you going? - Up.

578
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:04,698
The ladder will break.

579
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,500
Who is Chima?

580
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,665
Which party does he belong to?

581
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,338
Don't worry.

582
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,377
I'll bring him here in 30 minutes.

583
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:23,419
In 20 minutes Chima
will be at my feet.

584
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:24,779
What?

585
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:27,645
Let's go.

586
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:28,623
Inder. - Let's go.

587
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,752
Mother, let's go. - No. I won't go.

588
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:33,553
Inder hasn't returned from school yet.

589
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,561
I am lnder.

590
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,626
<i>Boss. Boss.</i>

591
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,792
The minister's sent
police to arrest us.

592
00:32:39,857 --> 00:32:40,995
Shut down everylhing.

593
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,704
Don't just stand there, close it down.

594
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,966
We're done for, boss!

595
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:46,441
Look, lnder got injured at school.

596
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:47,836
You've been called immediately.

597
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,676
Inder's injured?

598
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:51,538
Did you close the door?

599
00:32:53,671 --> 00:32:55,014
Hurry UP-

600
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,080
I forgot my book. - Nimmi..

601
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,778
Safe. We're safe.

602
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:00,979
Let's go.

603
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:05,791
Where did they go?

604
00:33:06,017 --> 00:33:06,927
Stop. Stop.

605
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:07,921
Come on.

606
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,397
Break it down.

607
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:14,995
Poor people.

608
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,805
You need strength for this.

609
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:19,474
See my strength,
Chima.

610
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,033
Now watch.

611
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:24,074
Boss once broke the
lock with his head.

612
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,411
I think this time he broke his head.

613
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,583
Pull.

614
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,584
Pull. - Slowly.

615
00:33:31,743 --> 00:33:33,723
We'll lose him, come on.

616
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:35,713
Kick him from the back.

617
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:36,924
Kick.

618
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,355
Wash your socks once in a while.

619
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:40,727
Find him. Chima!

620
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,124
Be careful.

621
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,924
My leg!

622
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:46,626
Oh God! - Come on, quickly.

623
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:51,931
Stop. - StoP-

624
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:52,565
Run.. run.

625
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,099
Where's that wretched Chima?

626
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,609
Catch them.

627
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,941
Boss!

628
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:03,375
Jump, boss. Trust us.
Come on.

629
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:04,910
Jump, boss.

630
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:08,414
Quickly..let's go to the school.

631
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,453
Careful.

632
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,083
Catch me. - We will.

633
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,424
Here I come. - Jump, boss.

634
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:16,857
The car.. - Here I come.

635
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:20,469
Rascals.

636
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,832
Everyone watch your step.

637
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,937
Hold on to the ladder.

638
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:24,962
Don't.

639
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,707
Catch him.

640
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:28,543
I am stuck up here.

641
00:34:28,633 --> 00:34:29,907
Do you want to kill me?

642
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:32,876
Put me down. - Get that car.

643
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:34,447
Take the car.

644
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:35,816
Get him out.

645
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,113
Come on..get out.

646
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:38,885
Where are they?

647
00:34:39,777 --> 00:34:40,778
Shut up.

648
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,748
Bhalla, I'll show you now.
Bhalla, you're dead.

649
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,621
Ready..catch me.

650
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,152
They're gone.

651
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:49,897
Rascalsmy [Jack's broken.

652
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:50,658
Come on.

653
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,193
Run..

654
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:01,369
Come on.

655
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,433
M'! Cycle.

656
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,808
Are you blind? - Get lost.

657
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:07,474
We'll finish them today.

658
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,748
Chima will be brought
here in 5 minutes.

659
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:15,620
Bhalla in Chima's car?

660
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:24,464
In two minutes Chima.. - Get lost.

661
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,329
Chima in a police car.

662
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,504
Get lost.

663
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,708
Take the basket. Keep it.

664
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:35,833
Side. Side.

665
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:37,669
Don't stop for anyone.

666
00:35:37,768 --> 00:35:38,803
Crush anyone who comes in between.

667
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,774
Why you..

668
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,545
Where did they come from?

669
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,551
Move them..come on.

670
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,311
You scoundrelsmove
them from the way.

671
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,621
<i>Boss,</i> cow's our mother.
I can't touch her.

672
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,793
Then you do it.

673
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,328
No, boss..she's my mother too.

674
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,090
You're a buffalo,
you go shove them away.

675
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:57,732
Cows are buffalo's sister.
So she's my aunt.

676
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,324
I can't do it either.
- You expect me to do it.

677
00:36:03,294 --> 00:36:05,535
I was making something
out of my life..

678
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:06,697
...and now I am stuck in this.

679
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,374
You didn't exactly
become my old age support

680
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:10,505
Hopeless.

681
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:12,146
You suppon your parents at old age..

682
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,272
...If they hold your
hand when you're young.

683
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,609
What did you do?

684
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,718
Threw him out. - Exactly.

685
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:19,179
He threw him out of the house.

686
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,154
Now even she's
commenting from the back.

687
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:23,723
The truth always huns.

688
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:24,718
You did throw me out.

689
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:26,193
Inder, what's wrong with you?

690
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,389
Nimmi just relax,
stay out of this, please.

691
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,194
Fine, please stop the
car..l've to 'make water'.

692
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,491
Do what?

693
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:35,861
I need to pee, okay.

694
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:38,367
Goons are chasing us,
and you want to pee.

695
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:41,775
What rulebook says that you
can't pee if goons are chasing you?

696
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,539
They can get here any moment.

697
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,245
Fine, you won't stop, will you?

698
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:47,405
I'll do it right here. I care a damn.

699
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,881
Don't stop the car now.
- Fine, I'm stopping.

700
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,551
Stop the car then. Stop now.

701
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:51,483
I'm stopping the car.

702
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:54,814
I've been telling you to stop,
but you don't listen.

703
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,881
Hurry up. - Shut up.

704
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,887
"My papa the great."

705
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,430
"My papa the great."

706
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:18,011
Five-lettered word..for
relief that you get after peeing.

707
00:37:18,336 --> 00:37:20,782
Bliss! Bliss! Bliss!

708
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:22,975
Hurry up!
That plant will turn into a tree.

709
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:26,015
This thing can't be controlled. Wait.

710
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,253
Chandigarh-Solan highway!

711
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,624
Switch off the radio.
Whose radio is that?

712
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,258
<i>Boss,</i> it's coming from there.

713
00:37:35,786 --> 00:37:36,526
It's coming from this, boss.

714
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,657
Chandigarh-Solan highway!

715
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:38,823
Inspector Gill reporting.

716
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:39,960
Atwal speaking.

717
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:41,302
Did you forget?

718
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,566
I ate 50 sweetmeats at the
wedding. - 50 sweetmeats?

719
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,503
Forget that, now listen carefully.

720
00:37:44,662 --> 00:37:47,074
Chima has fled in a police car.

721
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,334
The car's covered with
flags with flowery veil.

722
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,276
Don't let them escape.

723
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,005
Stop..stop the car.

724
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,808
He's talking about us.

725
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:55,942
Take the flags out.

726
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,646
Take all the flags out.

727
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,015
Couldn't you find any other car?

728
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,079
Bloody fools.

729
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,014
Chima.

730
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:06,026
Chima's here. - What?

731
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:08,455
Come on..hurry up. - Coming.

732
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,327
Fools..stupid. Don't you have any sense?
- Boss.

733
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,056
Look there, that's our car.

734
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,560
This isn't the time to joke.

735
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,568
I'm trying to explain him something.

736
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,333
Boss..l swear on you, that's our car.
Take a look. - Where?

737
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:18,633
That's our car, boss.

738
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,031
What the"

739
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:21,641
That is our car!

740
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,575
Didn't I just tell you that, boss?

741
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:23,668
Hurry up, quickly.

742
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:24,577
Come on, let's go.

743
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:26,815
We won't spare him this time.
- Hurry up.

744
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:29,574
Boss. - What?

745
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:30,683
Police!

746
00:38:32,677 --> 00:38:34,418
Turn the car around.

747
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:35,013
Turn it.

748
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,083
They don't even die.

749
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,918
I think that's them. Follow them.

750
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,433
Drive faster. Come on.
Can't you drive faster today?

751
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:48,432
At least wash your hands.

752
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:50,736
Lions never wash their hands or face.

753
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:51,566
Drama-queen.

754
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,106
Come on.

755
00:38:52,396 --> 00:38:54,774
Respect.

756
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:55,909
You drive.

757
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,506
Thinks he's a lion.

758
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,073
Stop at some restaurant up ahead.
I am hungry.

759
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:02,373
Now you want to eat.

760
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:06,920
Bravo.

761
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,684
Highway Motel. It's a nice place.

762
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:12,827
So..you will only take your mom along,
isn't it?

763
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,664
I'll go get food for us.

764
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:19,793
Listen, do you have money?
Or should l?

765
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:20,967
I'll manage.

766
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:24,566
And listen..don't be a miser.

767
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:25,833
We're Bhallas!

768
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,068
We eat till our heart's content,
not our stomach.

769
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:30,935
Stop staring, go on.

770
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:32,771
Where's your mother.

771
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:34,606
Come on, Pammi.

772
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,979
There's a cot laid out here, come on.

773
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,684
Come on, Nimmi.
- Who gave him alcohol?

774
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:41,757
I'll murder him and drink his blood.

775
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,757
He doesn't even care about
his wife when it comes to alcohol.

776
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:44,588
It's not our fault.

777
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,491
So is it my fault?

778
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,094
Who's going to dance with me now?

779
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:48,522
I am there, sweetheart.

780
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:55,460
Who said that?

781
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,734
Who said that?

782
00:39:56,827 --> 00:39:58,738
Hey heroine..look down.

783
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,309
I'm not scared of your slap,
sweetheart, but I am scared of love.

784
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:05,509
Hey SHOW--

785
00:40:05,669 --> 00:40:08,878
It'll take three of you
to dance with me. Get that?

786
00:40:08,973 --> 00:40:10,418
Pay first..and eat later.

787
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,253
We don't take credit cards.

788
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,990
What's the bill? - 4560 rupees.

789
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,423
Why so much?

790
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,861
Because singing and dancing
comes free with the meal.

791
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,429
Well..Jeeto's special offer for you.

792
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,540
Free food for singing
and dancing with me.

793
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:35,943
Will you do it?

794
00:40:37,501 --> 00:40:44,009
Inder..three extra ponions of grams.
Special ones. Order extra for us.

795
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,617
<i>And sweets.</i>

796
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:14,511

797
00:41:16,407 --> 00:41:18,910

"The drum of the Punjabis is beating"

799
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:29,789
"Dance to the beat of the drum"

800
00:41:29,887 --> 00:41:32,231
"Give me the permission."

801
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,258
"..to dance with you."

802
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:40,507
Wearing necklaces each
wonh 9 lakhs, O girls!

803
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:44,803
Dance beside me on
the beat of the drum.

804
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,538
"After drinking from your eyes."

805
00:41:47,605 --> 00:41:52,213
I'll shower dollars if
you keep on dancing this way

806
00:41:52,276 --> 00:41:56,725
<i>"l'll</i> dance with full energy."

807
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,885
"With You in tonight's function."

<i>"l'll</i> dance with full power."

809

"With You in tonight's function"

810
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,828
I won't sit being
tired and dejected.

811
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,961
"With You in tonight's function"

812
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,330
"After drinking from your eyes."

813
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:14,432
I'll shower if You
keep on dancing this way.

814
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,540
"L'll dance forgetting all shame."

815
00:42:19,436 --> 00:42:21,609
"l'll dance forgetting all shame."

816
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,846
"With You in tonight's function."

817
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:25,979
"You're dancing with full power."

"With me in tonight's function."

819
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:30,419
Come on..

820
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:36,988
Dance baby dance
with the Meet brothers.

821
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,597
They are not your mother.
Move the goats aside.

822
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:41,930
<i>Boss,</i> I can't touch them. - Why?

823
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:43,999
Mahatma Gandhi used
to drink goat's milk.

824
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:46,735
You don't think about Mahatma Gandhi
while devouring mutton.

825
00:42:47,598 --> 00:42:50,442
"Jeeto."

826
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:55,576
My sweetheart. -
You ripped my hean apan.

827
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:10,792
This bracelet is
dancing in your hands.

828
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:15,465
It is jingling and
tinkling to the beats.

829
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:20,475
May my beloved agree to
my proposal and become mine.

830
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:24,444
O wonderful lover,
You look great only beside me.

831
00:43:24,468 --> 00:43:31,283
I ignore everyone else, when you
look at me and keep at gazing at me.

832
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:35,757
"L'll flaunt the grace of a star."

I won't sit being
tired and dejected.

837
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,893
"With You in tonight's function."

838
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,446
I'm coming to pick you up, dear.

839
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:02,210
Okay, father.

840
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,252
Pick me up from Dara's Motel.

841
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:05,718
I hope you didn't forget..the
ceremonies stan at 10.

842
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,382
No, no..don't worry, papa.
I'll be there on time.

843
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:11,390
Won't look nice if you're
missing from your wedding.

844
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:12,290
0K8'!-

845
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,384
Come soon, dear.

846
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,255
Okay, bye. - 5V9-

847
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,196
Nimmi, when are you getting married?

00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,164
Four days later.

849
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,829
Spare no expenses at the wedding.

850
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,831
Listen..we could not do
anything special at our wedding.

851
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,906
But we'll spare no expenses
at lnder's wedding.

852
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,540
Yes, don't worry.

853
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,205
We'll give him a grand wedding.

854
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,280
Just rest.

855
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:35,582
We'll need her medicines.

856
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:37,275
Who charges for buttermilk?

857
00:44:37,408 --> 00:44:38,819
What are you saying? - Just joking.

858
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,412
How much? - 50 rupees.

859
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,583
She's here. - Nimmi.

860
00:44:44,548 --> 00:44:48,189
Nimmi, how are you? - Are you fine?

861
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:49,322
I am okay.

862
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:51,329
Papa, this is Bhalla uncle.

863
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:52,526
Hello. - Hello.

864
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:53,397
This is lnder.

865
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,401
Inder?

866
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,399
But you said Indira over the phone.

867
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:02,343
Indira's his sister. - I see.

868
00:45:02,933 --> 00:45:06,676
Leave that..aunt's not well.

869
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,941
Let's take her home. - Yes.

870
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,947
Don't worry.
There are three doctors at home.

871
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,950
Three? - Ayurvedic..Homeopathic
and Allopathic.

872
00:45:14,244 --> 00:45:15,222
We'll treat her at home.

873
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:15,848
Come, come, come!

874
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:23,489
Father..brother..look Nimmi's here.

875
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:24,624
Come, Come.
Come in.

876
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,725
Look, brother. Nimmi's here.

877
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,501
Look.
Nimmi's back.

878
00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:32,939
Come, Nimmi.

879
00:45:33,764 --> 00:45:35,539
They are all wearing same glasses.

880
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,683
No need to worry.

881
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:46,347
I just need to inject her.
And she'll be fine.

882
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:48,819
Allopathy is useless.

883
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:51,620
I've brought
Ayurvedic powder for you.

884
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:52,886
This will give you relief.

885
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,519
You've got powder for everylhing.

886
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:55,859
Powder for cold.

887
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,398
Powder for paralysis.

888
00:45:57,654 --> 00:45:59,759
This powder is
only good for laxative.

889
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,096
Try this homeopathy medicine.

890
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:05,465
Hey homeopathy.

891
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:08,668
Give those sugarcoated
pills to kids. They will suck on it.

892
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:11,110
These pills are good for nothing.

893
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,446
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

894
00:46:13,537 --> 00:46:14,880
Wait a minute.

895
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,848
She's already being treated
by the doctors at Sharda Old Age Home.

896
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:20,511
I know the doctor
at Sharda really well.

897
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,681
I'll ask them about her condition.

898
00:46:21,912 --> 00:46:23,016
The rest of you come along.

899
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:25,492
Let's have some dinner.

900
00:46:25,582 --> 00:46:26,390
Yes. Come on.

901
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:31,132
Those who speak the name of god.
They emerge victorious.

902
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:33,663
Hurry up, hurry up.
The groom's arriving tomorrow.

903
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,695
This is the limit.

904
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:36,929
You haven't decorated the car yet.

905
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:38,328
Mohit will be here in the morning.

906
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,500
Hurry up. Hurry up. - Fine.

907
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:41,968
But which car?

908
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,135
This one or this one?

909
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,002
Must be this one.
Come, let's decorate it.

910
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,414
Look..brother-in-law's photo.

911
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,007
Doesn't he look so cute?

912
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,752
I want to just eat him up.

913
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,413
Get on with the henna ceremony.
I'll join you in a minute.

914
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,421
Nimmi, you're so lucky.

915
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,756
Nimmi's so fortunate.

916
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,120
Because she's marrying
such a guy, right?

917
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,697
I always dreamed about
a wedding like this.

918
00:47:07,257 --> 00:47:10,363
When you get married,
make sure it's grand like this.

919
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:14,471
Your mother always wished
that we had a grand wedding.

920
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:17,576
But that could never happen.

921
00:47:17,901 --> 00:47:19,312
We took our nuptial rounds
in two pair of clothes.

922
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,178
...and in the presence
of four family members.

923
00:47:21,538 --> 00:47:24,576
I brought your
mom home in a rickshaw.

924
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:27,787
Nor did I have the
money to throw a feast.

925
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:30,954
You served sugarcane juice
to everyone and chucked them out.

926
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,726
I was going to say that.
- I know.

927
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:36,557
I've been hearing your
sob story since I was a kid.

928
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:37,325
Really?

929
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:40,263
Mr. Bhalla..let me introduce you.

930
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:42,327
My aunt's son, Billu Gill.

931
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,937
Greetings. - Greetings.

932
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,437
Nimmi was saying that your
daughter Indira lives abroad.

933
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,242
Indira?

934
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,443
Yes, she does.

935
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,012
That's Lucky, his son.

936
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:53,771
Greetings.
- He wants to go abroad as well.

937
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:54,881
This is great.

938
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:56,918
You two talk, I'll be right back.

939
00:47:57,774 --> 00:48:03,224
Mr. Billu, your <i>son's</i>
Lucky while my <i>son's</i> unlucky.

940
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,293
For the past 10 years I've
been telling him to go abroad.

941
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:07,488
But he doesn't listen.

942
00:48:07,651 --> 00:48:10,427
He says..l won't
leave my parents.

943
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,898
How could I go, uncle?

944
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:14,299
My love for my
parents is such that.

945
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:16,268
...l can't leave them and go away.

946
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,806
He'll only get spoilt out there.

947
00:48:18,962 --> 00:48:21,340
He'll be so rude..

948
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,969
...that he won't stop the
car even if you have to pee.

949
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,806
No, papa..l will
stop the car. I swear.

950
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:31,981
Lucky..how can
you stop the car..

951
00:48:32,442 --> 00:48:36,049
...when you find out that your father's
borrowed money from everyone..

952
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,485
...and goons are chasing
you for recovery.

953
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,686
How will you stop the car?

954
00:48:39,783 --> 00:48:41,023
What? When did I borrow any money?

955
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:43,993
Remember, sir.
He'll forget all about you instantly.

956
00:48:44,321 --> 00:48:47,359
And only come back for
his share in the property.

957
00:48:47,457 --> 00:48:49,562
No, papa..
- Shut up, stupid fool.

958
00:48:50,861 --> 00:48:51,965
Bloody hopeless case.

959
00:48:53,664 --> 00:48:55,871
Have you seen lnder?
- Yes, he's on the terrace.

960
00:49:01,505 --> 00:49:02,415
Let me guess.

961
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:05,017
You're hoping that it was
you who was getting married.

962
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:06,913
And it was you instead of Mohit.

963
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,055
I did give you a chance, lnder.

964
00:49:10,881 --> 00:49:12,019
What to do, madam?

965
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,596
You see..l can't
tolerate happiness.

966
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,058
It's been like this
since my childhood.

967
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:19,561
Here we go again.

968
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:22,962
Now you'll talk about your
childhood and blame your papa again.

969
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,705
See,
it's none of my business, but.

970
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:32,745
...why don't you talk
to your papa once.

971
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:35,542
You know, man-to-man.

972
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:39,017
Talking to him is
like talking to a wall.

973
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,354
He's extremely stubborn.

974
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:42,420
Completely adamant.

975
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,753
Oh..so you're
just like your papa.

976
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:50,626
No..l am not like him.

977
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:54,926
He wasted his entire
life and did nothing.

978
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,931
Look at him now.

979
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,373
He's solving crosswords.

980
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:03,544
So now you've a problem
with his crossword.

981
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:08,080
No, no..l've a problem
with his indolence.

982
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,343
No ambition at all.

983
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,744
And he never did.

984
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,749
Hello..hello..what
are you doing here?

985
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,685
Come on,
the musical program has started.

986
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:37,206
You only live once..life
gives no second chance.

987
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,746
Cut out your
ego..set your mood.

988
00:50:39,836 --> 00:50:41,747
"Flaunt your style."

989
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:44,851
Park your
car..darken the light.

990
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,714
Switch on the music,
and switch off your phones.

991
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,485
"Forget the world."

992
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:52,525
"Yo-Yolo..you only live once."

993
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,359
So baby let's live..
you only live once.

994
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:57,796
"Yo-Yolo..you only live once."

995
00:50:57,854 --> 00:51:00,630
So baby let's live..
you only live once.

996
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,670
"Ohh Billo tell me."

997
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:06,674
She says all the dancing
is making her sweat.

998
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:11,543
She make it twerk no ballerina
We only live once.

999
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:16,243
Put those branded glasses
on..and set that hair.

1000
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:21,447
We keep swaying all
night..without a care.

1001
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,782
Cool your mind..cast
out your tensions.

1002
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:27,555
Feel your life..and
heal your hean.

1003
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,426
"Erase your pain."

1004
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,791
You only live once..life
gives no second chance.

1005
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,495
Cut out your
ego..set your mood.

1006
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:37,163
"Flaunt your style."

1007
00:51:37,727 --> 00:51:40,298
"Yo-Yolo..you only live once."

1008
00:51:40,397 --> 00:51:42,900
So baby let's live..
you only live once.

1009
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,578
"Yo-Yolo..you only live once."

1010
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,378
So baby let's live..
you only live once.

1011
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,884
"Yo-Yolo..you only live once."

1012
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,615
So baby let's live..
you only live once.

1013
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:56,247
"Yo-Yolo..you only live once."

1014
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,791
So baby let's live..
you only live once.

1015
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:02,089
Stop all this.
- Turn it off.

1016
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,760
Where's the father-son duo?

1017
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:05,364
We are here.

1018
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,623
Do I look like a clown?

1019
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:08,697
Where's Bhalla and lnder?

1020
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:09,896
Yes, where are they?

1021
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:11,336
They were right here.

1022
00:52:11,428 --> 00:52:12,839
Check that side. Take a look.

1023
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:14,503
This way?

1024
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,300
Sister-in-law,
why don't you tell us?

1025
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:17,309
Where is he?

1026
00:52:19,402 --> 00:52:21,575
Now..you're all done for.

1027
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:25,445
Where's my gun?

1028
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,413
Hey..hand over the keys.

1029
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:28,785
Hand it over. Hand it over.

1030
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,493
Where's the gun?

1031
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:40,266
Where's the gun?

1032
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:41,660
Where's the gun?

1033
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:44,603
Sir..your boss
is asking for the gun.

1034
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:45,795
The gun.

1035
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:47,298
Coming, boss.

1036
00:52:47,631 --> 00:52:51,306
Look, I don't have a gun
right now, but we're dangerous people.

1037
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:54,448
So tell us..
- <i>Boss,</i> here's the gun.

1038
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:56,017
Move..move back.

1039
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:58,810
Now tell me where he is.

1040
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:01,718
Otherwise you know..
"You only live Once".

1041
00:53:01,978 --> 00:53:03,582
Yelo-lo-lo-lo.

1042
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:05,856
That's "Yolo".

1043
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:07,284
Yolo. - Correct.

1044
00:53:07,384 --> 00:53:09,489
Chima, I really..
- Tell me where's lnder.

1045
00:53:09,719 --> 00:53:11,995
<i>Boss,</i> lnder sent me with the gun.

1046
00:53:14,824 --> 00:53:15,894
Where is he? - He's..

1047
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,767
You.. - What's going on?

1048
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,063
He cannot escape this time.

1049
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:21,673
Hurry up. - Come on.

1050
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,868
Trying to escape.
I'll grab him by his hair.

1051
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:25,845
Catch them.

1052
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,381
Dear, who are they?

1053
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,851
Brother, why are they coming back?

1054
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,615
Bring the girl.

1055
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,418
Leave me.
- Not the aunty, the girl.

1056
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,458
Nimmi dear..

1057
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,761
Don't bother to inform the police,
or we'll send you her deadbody.

1058
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,831
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

1059
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:49,527
Nimmi..take care, dear.

1060
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:50,697
Come on, sit.

1061
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:54,774
I don't understand what's
going on or what I should be doing.

1062
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:57,037
Brother, the groom's
arriving in the morning.

1063
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:57,901
But Nimmi's gone.

1064
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:15,632
HintFilmiizle(dot)com

1065
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:25,632
My brother's home..is that way.

1066
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,797
Left..take a left.

1067
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,826
Boss. - Where did they go?

1068
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:48,727
I think they took a left.

1069
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:53,997
Everyone thinks
they went this way.

1070
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,604
But they went that way.
- No, Chima, they went this way.

1071
00:54:57,827 --> 00:54:58,737
I'm telling you.

1072
00:54:58,828 --> 00:54:59,670
Let's go this way.

1073
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:00,600
WonderfuL.

1074
00:55:00,664 --> 00:55:03,873
Boss. - You're great.

1075
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,674
See, baldy..education is necessary.

1076
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,010
As if you're a graduate.

1077
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,524
Listen.

1078
00:55:19,683 --> 00:55:21,253
Stop the car at the side,
I need to pee.

1079
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,795
Pee..l want to pee.

1080
00:55:25,188 --> 00:55:27,634
Such a pathetic driver,
you'll make me wet my pants.

1081
00:55:28,558 --> 00:55:30,299
Why are you taking
us in the bushes?

1082
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:32,304
Your uncle's chasing us.

1083
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:34,168
They won't spare us this time.

1084
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:35,801
They can't catch us.
Stop the car. Stop.

1085
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:37,405
I really need to go.

1086
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:40,240
This car's such a nuisance.

1087
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:44,579
"It's coming..coming..coming."

1088
00:55:46,876 --> 00:55:48,412
Hello. - Yeah Ronnie.

1089
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:51,751
Inder, I am at Mr.
Dhingra's place.

1090
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,459
Talk to him.

1091
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,721
Inder..the great Singer.

1092
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:57,521
Mr. Dhingra, how are you?

1093
00:55:57,654 --> 00:56:00,328
Well..there's a Mr.
Chhada sitting next to me.

1094
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:01,731
He's from Ludhiana.

1095
00:56:02,325 --> 00:56:04,601
He wants to make his own album.

1096
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:08,171
He's got loads
of money..but no songs.

1097
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:11,742
I suggesLthat
you two make a deal.

1098
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,778
And you both will be happy.

1099
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,945
It will be your album.

1100
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,250
But with Chhada sir's
name and picture.

1101
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,453
He's ready to pay any amount.

1102
00:56:21,511 --> 00:56:22,683
Whatever price you say.

1103
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,953
Mr. Dhingra,
will give the phone to Ronnie.

1104
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:25,919
Wait.

1105
00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:27,455
He'll think it over.

1106
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:28,254
Ronnie.

1107
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:28,761
Yes, sir. - Here you go.

1108
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:31,527
Tell him..he'll get cash and
cheque..whatever he wants. - Yes.

1109
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:32,825
Yeah, lnder. - Chhada sir.

1110
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:36,466
Tell him..l didn't compose
these songs for selling them.

1111
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,301
Is there a problem?

1112
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,231
You don't have to worry.

1113
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:45,369
If you've problem, then go back.

1114
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:46,740
I'll handle things here.

1115
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:49,810
You'll handle it. - Yes.

1116
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,149
I see..

1117
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:53,277
Is this how you handle things?

1118
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:54,816
If you had really
handled everylhing..

1119
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,323
"Then we wouldn't
be in this predicament.

1120
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,417
Use your brains.

1121
00:56:58,581 --> 00:57:00,686
Sell the bakery and
put an end to all this.

1122
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,654
And what do I do after I sell it?

1123
00:57:03,153 --> 00:57:05,827
Sell candy-ﬂoss and
gumballs outside schools.

1124
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,168
At least there's something I own.

1125
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:09,393
And few people
still visit the place.

1126
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:11,494
Only a handful people
come your place for years.

1127
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,305
Bajwa, Gupta, Sharma and Gulati.

1128
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:15,900
And you can live the rest
of your life depending on them.

1129
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:17,473
Who else can I depend on?

1130
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,747
You left me and went ahead
to make a life of your own.

1131
00:57:21,504 --> 00:57:24,383
And as for your mothenshe
sick most of the time.

1132
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,514
All I have is my bakery.

1133
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,284
That bakery is
just your stubbornness.

1134
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,122
No..it was my stubbornness.

1135
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:35,485
But now it's become my necessity.

1136
00:57:37,187 --> 00:57:39,258
Every morning when I
get up and go the bakery..

1137
00:57:39,355 --> 00:57:41,130
...l feel like there's
still some meaning to life.

1138
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,869
I'll keep sitting in my
bakery as long as I am alive.

1139
00:57:47,730 --> 00:57:49,334
I don't want to retire
before I am dead.

1140
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,202
You can leave if you want to.

1141
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:52,846
I'll look after your mother.

1142
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:54,940
Pammi.

1143
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:57,540
Where did Pammi go?

1144
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:00,219
Pammi.

1145
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,646
You look that side.

1146
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:05,382
Pammi.

1147
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:07,459
Pammi.

1148
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,494
Mom!

1149
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:16,867
Pammi.

1150
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:19,034
Pammi.

1151
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:23,606
"L set out..in my vehicle."

1152
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:27,905
Son, hand me the wrench.
- Here you go.

1153
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:30,045
"L came at a turn.."

1154
00:58:30,373 --> 00:58:31,545
Why you..

1155
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:33,516

1156
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,422
Aunty, where do you want to go?

00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:42,388
Inder.. I've to get to lnder's school.

1158
00:58:42,585 --> 00:58:45,794
Where the hell are we?
Wonder where they are gone?

1159
00:58:47,824 --> 00:58:49,098
They always disappear.

1160
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,104
Let's try calling them.

1161
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,735
Your mom.. - I don't know.

1162
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:57,936
Wait a minute.

1163
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,876
Didn't Chima hang your
phone around her neck?

1164
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,075
Yes, why?

1165
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:02,082
Oh yes, call her.

01:03:22,231 --> 01:03:23,437
Mister.

1241
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:25,970
...Is everylhing alright?

1242
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,373
The fritters are amazing. Superb.

1243
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,777
Forget the fritters..is
Arora still in?

1244
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:32,481
This way.

1245
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,387
Come.

1246
01:03:38,714 --> 01:03:39,488
Greetings.

1247
01:03:39,582 --> 01:03:40,253
Aunt'!-

1248
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,895
lnder..you're here.

1249
01:03:42,952 --> 01:03:43,862
You did the right thing.

1250
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:50,966
Your uncle's met a terrible fate.
It's really terrible.

1251
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:54,298
He went out in his new Mercedes.

1252
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:56,465
But on the way..a truck
driver saw him and said..

1253
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,378
Hip-hip-hurray Mr.
Arora, brand new Mercedes.

1254
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:03,746
And your uncle took his
hand off the steering wheel..

1255
01:04:03,973 --> 01:04:05,577
...and replied "Hip-hip-hurray".

1256
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:09,851
And smashed his new Mercedes.

1257
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:12,315
But is the pole okay."

1258
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,259
I mean, your uncle Kirpal.
ls he okay?

1259
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:16,422
Can we talk to him?

1260
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:19,064
We haven't seen him yet,
how can you?

1261
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:22,667
Mother.
- Oh my, somethings wrong.

1262
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:24,400
What happened?

1263
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,004
Papa's breathing heavily.

1264
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:28,640
Oh my..it's almost time.

1265
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,440
Finish eating everyone.
- Finish the fritters.

1266
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,445
Come on, come quickly.

1267
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:36,676
Inder, if he goes..the
jewels are gone too.

1268
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:38,884
It's time.

1269
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:40,487
What happened?

1270
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:43,650
It's time..it's time.

1271
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:47,357
Bhalla. - Kirpal.

1272
01:04:47,650 --> 01:04:49,652
Inder. - He's calling you.

1273
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:51,992
Come here, son. Come here.

1274
01:04:56,259 --> 01:04:57,363
Come closer, son.

1275
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,172
Jewels. The jewels.

1276
01:04:59,262 --> 01:05:05,440
Your mother's..jewels.

1277
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:07,174
What about the jewels? Tell me.

1278
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:07,714
Gone.

1279
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:10,640
The jewels are gone.

1280
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:12,375
He's dead.

1281
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:15,412
Papa.

1282
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:18,716
Did you insure
the Mercedes or not?

1283
01:05:19,348 --> 01:05:21,385
Nimmi, sweetheart. I am here.

1284
01:05:21,717 --> 01:05:22,457
Nimmi.

1285
01:05:27,056 --> 01:05:31,562
Oh..my Johnny Walker.

1286
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:38,135
Lord is the ultimate truth."

1287
01:05:38,234 --> 01:05:46,153
"Lord is the ultimate truth."

1288
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:50,321
"Lord is the ultimate truth."

1289
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:53,519
We're carrying a dead body here,
are you blind?

1290
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,221
"Lord is the ultimate truth."

1291
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,424
I got a good shoot. - Right.

1292
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,057
Let me come forward.

1293
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:03,126
What the..careful. -
Lord is the ultimate truth.

1294
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,136
He only looks skinny.

1295
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:07,468
But honestly he's
heavier than a mountain.

1296
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,871
He's turned into
a bull with our money.

1297
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,506
Hey..laundryman.
- Move the red cloth.

1298
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,547
"Lord is the ultimate truth."

1299
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,681
Fine..fine.."Lord is
the ultimate truth."

1300
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:17,847
Watch your step.

1301
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:22,713
"Lord is the ultimate truth."

1302
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:26,183
"Lord is the ultimate truth."

1303
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:29,588
Holy Cow.. Careful.

1304
01:06:30,152 --> 01:06:31,597
Careful. -
Lord is the ultimate truth.

1305
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:33,166
"Lord is the ultimate truth."

1306
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,230
Come back, lnder.

1307
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:37,631
Good catch.

1308
01:06:39,195 --> 01:06:40,765
Uncle, return our ball.

1309
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:43,406
Uncle, return our ball.

1310
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:45,202
Uncle, return our ball.

1311
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:46,871
Will you take it along?

1312
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:50,107
What option do we have?

1313
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:52,510
Did you ever try to stick
your hands in a crocodile's jaw..

1314
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:53,678
...and rip his heart?

1315
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:55,116
"Lord is the ultimate truth."

1316
01:06:58,581 --> 01:07:01,824
He's left me all alone.

1317
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:08,802
My husband is dead..
He went so suddenly.

1318
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,972
He used to ride a Mercedes here.

1319
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:15,942
What will he be riding up there?

1320
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:19,973
He's made me a widow.

1321
01:07:20,803 --> 01:07:21,508
Louder!

1322
01:07:21,604 --> 01:07:22,344
You too.

1323
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,010
What's all this?
- Where did they come from?

1324
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:32,282
Keep saying?

1325
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:35,852
He ate stuffed bread here..
What will he eat up there?

1326
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:38,863
Hi!

1327
01:07:39,655 --> 01:07:40,633
Hi!

1328
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:43,268
Hi!

1329
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:46,296
Listen, Nimmi. Sorry.

1330
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,840
You'll have to wait
little longer because of us.

1331
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:48,765
It's okay.

1332
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:49,740
Inder.

1333
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,572
Come here. You want this?

1334
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,870
There's the
crocodile with the heart.

1335
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:56,239
Let's go.

1336
01:07:56,572 --> 01:08:00,714
Inder, you're here.
You made me really happy.

1337
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,824
Your uncle really loved you.

1338
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:07,956
He used to say lnder
earns in Dollars.

1339
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:09,791
Listen to me, son.

1340
01:08:09,885 --> 01:08:11,887
Your uncle had a wish..

1341
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:14,461
...that we throw a
big feast for everyone.

1342
01:08:14,557 --> 01:08:17,333
And son, we left no deanh.

1343
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,771
We made sweetmeat in organic ghee.

1344
01:08:21,197 --> 01:08:23,803
And fritters fried in olive oil.

1345
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:26,913
And your uncle's
left this for you.

1346
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,271
Son, I have just one request.

1347
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:33,017
Lend me 300,000 rupees.

1348
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:36,916
I'll install three benches
at the station in your uncle's memory.

1349
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,021
And it will also bear your name.
"NRl lnder".

1350
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,625
Here you go, son. This is for you.

1351
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:43,387
The bills for all the expenses.

1352
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,694
Just give me 300,000..
- Curse you, you wretch.

1353
01:08:46,922 --> 01:08:48,299
Don't you have any shame?

1354
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,634
You want us to pay for
your husband's final rites.

1355
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,795
Liar.

1356
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,797
Kirpal must have
left our jewelry behind.

1357
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:55,831
Tell us where they are.

1358
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,966
What jewelry?

1359
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,770
What about the time when
you left your mother here?

1360
01:08:59,835 --> 01:09:01,508
Who was paying for her expenses?

1361
01:09:01,604 --> 01:09:02,674
You left mother here?

1362
01:09:02,938 --> 01:09:04,008
I'll tell you later.

1363
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:07,879
Son, your father troubled
your mother so much.

1364
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:08,887
...that she lost her mind.

1365
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:09,922
Hey drama queen!

1366
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:13,449
And when she lost her mind,
this rascal threw her out.

1367
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:14,551
You're uttering nonsense.

1368
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,856
You threw mother out of the house?

1369
01:09:16,285 --> 01:09:18,356
Don't listen to her,
I'll tell you the truth.

1370
01:09:18,454 --> 01:09:22,334
And son, we looked after
your mother for a year.

1371
01:09:22,424 --> 01:09:26,600
Hopeless woman..stop ranting.

1372
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:27,037
Listen to me.

1373
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:28,900
I am sure he never told you this.

1374
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,912
He divorced your mother,
I've got proof.

1375
01:09:33,502 --> 01:09:34,503
What are you saying?

1376
01:09:34,537 --> 01:09:35,914
You divorced mother?

1377
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,543
What?

1378
01:09:41,777 --> 01:09:43,848
Brother lnder! Brother lnder!

1379
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,819
What happened?

1380
01:09:46,081 --> 01:09:47,822
Move..move back.

1381
01:09:48,284 --> 01:09:51,458
Papa has left this key for you.

1382
01:09:51,654 --> 01:09:53,099
What key? Show me?

1383
01:09:53,322 --> 01:09:58,237
No..father said "Mom's a
crocodile, she'll devour everylhing".

1384
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:00,362
Heard that, you crocodile.
- You shut up.

1385
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,499
Well..don't just stand there,
catch the short one.

1386
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:03,440
Give me the key. - Here.

1387
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:04,773
Chote, give me the key.

1388
01:10:05,100 --> 01:10:05,840
Give me the key.

1389
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:07,808
Come and get it.
- Come on.. - Stop.

1390
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,878
Here's the key.
Come and get it.

1391
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:13,384
Stop. What are you doing?

1392
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:17,689
Chote, give me the
key or else I'll spank you.

1393
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,326
Chote, what are you doing?

1394
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:25,730
Stop, Chote.

1395
01:10:27,523 --> 01:10:29,161
Move aside.

1396
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:30,326
Wait.

1397
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,269
Chote..

1398
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,205
Catch him.

1399
01:10:34,797 --> 01:10:35,901
Brother lnder.

1400
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,374
You are all my brothers.

1401
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:48,344
...so I won't raise my hand on you.

1402
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:52,554
But if anyone tries to stop us..

1403
01:10:53,816 --> 01:10:56,888
...l'll give them
a sound thrashing and..

1404
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:01,333
I'll beat you up real bad.

1405
01:11:24,046 --> 01:11:25,218
Which cupboard does this key open?

1406
01:11:25,514 --> 01:11:27,255
This doesn't open any cupboard.

1407
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,524
It's the key to a
locker in Kasol Bank.

1408
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,619
Back to Kasol?

1409
01:11:41,697 --> 01:11:43,108
Stop the car.

1410
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:46,837
I said stop the car.

1411
01:11:48,103 --> 01:11:49,275
Will you please stop the car?

1412
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:50,340
Stop the car.

1413
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,524
Ask.

1414
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:02,495
Why don't you ask..why
I threw your mother out?

1415
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:03,823
Why did I divorce her?

1416
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,530
Ask whatever you want.

1417
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:07,495
There's no need to ask.

1418
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:09,730
I've been watching
everylhing since I was a kid.

1419
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:11,329
And I should've
realized everylhing..

1420
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:13,339
...when I saw mom at the
Old Age Home the other day.

1421
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,767
She was there
because she was sick.

1422
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:18,105
Why won't she fall sick?

1423
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:22,147
A woman that served you
all her life, endured your taunts..

1424
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:25,080
...If you divorce her at this age,
she's bound to fall sick.

1425
01:12:25,274 --> 01:12:26,617
Look at what you've done to her.

1426
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,120
You..you're responsible
for your mother's condition.

1427
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,154
Wow..that's..

1428
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,725
Fantastic man..that's unbelievable.
You just keep it up, okay.

1429
01:12:32,815 --> 01:12:34,852
Stop showing off your English.

1430
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:37,358
Do you have the strength
to hear the truth?

1431
01:12:38,787 --> 01:12:41,495
Your mother had already
given up on me..

1432
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,759
...because I was
uselesshopeless.

1433
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,130
But you were the apple of her eye.

1434
01:12:46,228 --> 01:12:49,402
My child will make
me proud..look after me.

1435
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,342
"He'll suppon in my old-age."

1436
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:55,047
But this kid..left her all alone.

1437
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:58,114
I may have divorced her,
but I am with her now.

1438
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,715
You did this to her.
It was you. Only you!

1439
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,120
Fine..fine...!

1440
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,324
I left her, right?

1441
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:06,548
She's my responsibility.

1442
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,661
So now I'm taking
mother back with me.

1443
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,654
You can stay
here with your bakery.

1444
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:11,788
You think that.

1445
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,674
I have seven kids..

1446
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,542
But you're all just
a bunch of fools. Look at them.

1447
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,114
<i>Boss,</i> do we come along too? - Yes.

1448
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:31,150
Bloody beggars,
have you seen your clothes?

1449
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,743
Clothes.
- His uncle seems to be a rich man.

1450
01:13:34,543 --> 01:13:35,487
I'll go alone.

1451
01:13:35,577 --> 01:13:36,351
0K8'!-

1452
01:13:36,545 --> 01:13:38,286
No one will get down from the car.

1453
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,358
<i>Fine, boss.</i>

1454
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:42,159
Look at him licking ice-cream.
and laughing.

1455
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,127
I'll slap you.

1456
01:13:43,218 --> 01:13:43,821
Stupid.

1457
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:46,088
Greetings. - Greetings.

1458
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:48,258
Are you Mr. Arora,
the Mercedes owner's, wife?

1459
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:48,858
Yes.

1460
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,395
Well..Mr. Bhalla's my uncle.

1461
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,462
So? I had an imponant
message for him.

1462
01:13:53,796 --> 01:13:54,831
He's here, isn't he?

1463
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,165
Can you call him?

1464
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,438
Well..go call Bhalla now.

1465
01:13:58,500 --> 01:13:59,376
Okay, mom.

1466
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:01,573
Come on.. - Come..

1467
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,807
You want to meet Bhalla, don't you?
- Listen to me.

1468
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:05,250
Listen to me.

1469
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,820
This is wrong.

1470
01:14:08,076 --> 01:14:10,147
I think the boss
is getting beaten up.

1471
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:11,449
Come inside.

1472
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:13,559
Shall we go in? - Shut up.

1473
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:15,387
The boss said no, remember.

1474
01:14:15,684 --> 01:14:16,754
Have you seen your clothes?

1475
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:21,595
Nephew's looking so handsome.

1476
01:14:21,657 --> 01:14:22,863
Get lost.

1477
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,366
Look at the boss' clothes.

1478
01:14:25,661 --> 01:14:26,935
Don't forget your jacket.

1479
01:14:29,364 --> 01:14:30,900
Yeah, Ronnie. - Yeah, lnder.

1480
01:14:31,266 --> 01:14:33,041
The bank formalities will
be done with by tomorrow. - Okay.

1481
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:35,240
But I'll have to wait few days.

1482
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:37,372
...to arrange for
mom's passpon and visa.

1483
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,719
You're bringing your parents here.

1484
01:14:40,843 --> 01:14:43,016
Not my parents..just mom.

1485
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:44,085
And Bhalla uncle?

1486
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:45,954
I just said only mom.

1487
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:47,759
Did you have a fight
with your father again?

1488
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:50,091
It's not that, papa. - I don't
have the time to explain all this.

1489
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:51,698
We were stuck.

1490
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:53,696
I'll be home in 3-4 hours.

1491
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:56,028
But what will we
tell Mohit until then?

1492
01:14:56,291 --> 01:14:57,702
Tell him I am angry with him.

1493
01:14:57,893 --> 01:14:59,133
Just make some excuse, papa.

1494
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,136
Come soon. - Okay.

1495
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:08,042
If you are marrying
him then tell him the truth.

1496
01:15:08,804 --> 01:15:09,805
No need to lie.

1497
01:15:10,205 --> 01:15:11,912
One has to make excuses, lnder.

1498
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:14,111
Because life has given
us excuses for staying together.

1499
01:15:14,376 --> 01:15:17,186
As you can
see..first in the plane.

1500
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:18,916
Then we had to run away together.

1501
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,127
You even dropped me home.

1502
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,652
But Chima brought me to you again.

1503
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:27,363
This is some divine scheme..which
will ultimately unite us.

1504
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:32,896
It's a fraud.

1505
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:35,007
Marry Mohit, he's a good boy.

1506
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:37,676
Come on.

1507
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:42,078
Brother-in-law.Brother-in-law.
- I am going.

1508
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,413
Nimmi doesn't want to see
you until you don't grow a moustache.

1509
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:46,378
Are you crazy?

1510
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:49,116
I can't grow
a moustache so easily.

1511
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:52,690
Please drink some cold drink.
- I don't want it.

1512
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:53,818
Please, have it.

1513
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:00,095
Did you eat? - Yes, I did.

1514
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:01,993
With my own hands.

1515
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:04,431
Wow. Congratulations.

1516
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:07,965
And where is he?

1517
01:16:12,267 --> 01:16:15,874
How many times have I told
to get the good stuff.

1518
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:17,110
<i>This thing stings.</i>

1519
01:16:18,073 --> 01:16:19,177
Should l? - Yeah.

1520
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:22,183
I meant me..dab it on me.

1521
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:24,223
<i>Boss, boss, boss..look.</i>

1522
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:25,916
I think that's our car.

1523
01:16:28,717 --> 01:16:30,424
That is our car.

1524
01:16:30,786 --> 01:16:31,924
Go and get it. - Yeah..

1525
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:36,695
And listen..be swift.

1526
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:37,995
Okay. - Go.

1527
01:16:39,027 --> 01:16:39,971
You carry on.

1528
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:42,335
Slowly. - Carefully.

1529
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:43,733
Come on.

1530
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:45,302
RascaL.

1531
01:16:45,434 --> 01:16:46,879
Tip-toe. Tip-toe.

1532
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,441
Bhalla, you..

1533
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:53,479
Hey..let's go. Quickly.

1534
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,252
They are here already.

1535
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:59,456
Hey, stop.

1536
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:01,292
They are gone.

1537
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:03,760
Come quickly. Come on. - Coming.

1538
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:05,924
Stop tip-toeing and run.

1539
01:17:05,988 --> 01:17:07,194
Come on. - Run!

1540
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,275
Faster. Drive faster. - Quickly.

1541
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:22,478
Bhalla..l got beaten
up because of you.

1542
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,614
I won't spare you this time.

1543
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:27,344
I'm paying the installments on the
car..and they're taking it for a spin.

1544
01:17:33,448 --> 01:17:34,893
They're driving really fast.

1545
01:17:35,317 --> 01:17:36,887
After all it's our car, boss.

1546
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:42,329
What are you doing?

1547
01:17:42,491 --> 01:17:43,834
Inder, what are you doing?

1548
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,169
Why is lnder
trying to flee from us?

1549
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:52,801
Why is lnder coming this way?

1550
01:17:54,202 --> 01:17:56,546
Chima..catch him. - <i>Boss,</i> police.

1551
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:58,374
You will get us killed,
where do you think you're going?

1552
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:03,221
Where did he go?

1553
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:04,649
Forgive me. Turn back.

1554
01:18:04,713 --> 01:18:06,351
What are you doing? - Forgive me.

1555
01:18:07,149 --> 01:18:09,390
I won't do it again. - Boss.

1556
01:18:09,851 --> 01:18:11,387
Don't turn back.

1557
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,727
Shove them in. - Where are we?

1558
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:14,860
What are you doing?

1559
01:18:15,123 --> 01:18:17,729
I can't see a thing.
- That's my stick.

1560
01:18:17,826 --> 01:18:18,896
It's so dark.

1561
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:19,862
Drive.

1562
01:18:20,295 --> 01:18:21,672
Come on. - Get out. Quickly.

1563
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:22,470
Where is he?

1564
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:27,207
Sir, before you're
fired from your job..

1565
01:18:27,669 --> 01:18:30,240
...l suggest that
you resign yourself.

1566
01:18:30,505 --> 01:18:32,416
It will save you the humiliation.

1567
01:18:37,312 --> 01:18:38,655
What's happening.

1568
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:39,849
It stopped.

1569
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:43,061
This was bound to happen.

1570
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,857
Hit the self.
- I'm doing just that.

1571
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:51,495
"Papa says someday l'll be famous."

1572
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,537
Push“

1573
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,305
This wouldn't have happened
if you weren't driving so recklessly.

1574
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:58,777
Now just push.

1575
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:01,178
Nimmi, put the car in gear. - Yes.

1576
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:03,281
Come on.

1577
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,678
Try now. - I am.

1578
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:09,647
Nimmi.

1579
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:13,692
Where are you going?

1580
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,868
Flowers for the pretty ladies.

1581
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:26,670
How sweet, uncle.

1582
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:31,174
And romantic.

1583
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,380
What do I say?

1584
01:19:36,671 --> 01:19:38,912
People used to swear
by our love-story.

1585
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,185
Tell her. Tell her.

1586
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,355
She's feeling shy.

1587
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,853
Why don't you tell
us some story, uncle?

1588
01:19:46,515 --> 01:19:47,619
What do I say?

1589
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:49,160
Come on, push.

1590
01:19:50,185 --> 01:19:51,687
His grandpa wanted.

1591
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:52,630
Come on, push.

1592
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,829
His grandpa fixed her
marriage with some army man.

1593
01:19:56,725 --> 01:20:00,229
Her family must have thought,
he's in the army..

1594
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:01,898
...and has regular income.

1595
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:03,640
He'll keep Pammi happy.

1596
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:07,407
But Pammi's happiness
was with this Bhalla.

1597
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:09,914
I eloped with her on
the day of her engagement.

1598
01:20:10,172 --> 01:20:12,550
...from the army cantonment
and amidst hundreds of army men.

1599
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:14,411
Really? - Yes.

1600
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:16,453
And then? - Then they got married.

1601
01:20:18,580 --> 01:20:19,388
Boring.

1602
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,489
He's a hopeless case.

1603
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:23,686
Don't you want to know
what happened after the marriage?

1604
01:20:26,721 --> 01:20:28,564
After they got married,
the love between them was over.

1605
01:20:32,894 --> 01:20:35,966
And when the love was over,
<i>so</i> was their marriage.

1606
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,446
Really sorry, papa.
But we're at the station.

1607
01:20:50,111 --> 01:20:51,249
That's fine, dear.

1608
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:54,055
But what do I do about Mohit,
he's getting crazy.

1609
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,662
No matter how hard I try to
explain, he just doesn't understand.

1610
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:58,765
Sir..very,
very, very, very sorry.

1611
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:02,396
It so happened that
our car broke down.

1612
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,628
And we're taking the
morning train. - I see.

1613
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:08,163
Don't worry at all.
Nimmi is like my daughter. - Yes.

1614
01:21:08,330 --> 01:21:10,207
I had a word with the guard.

1615
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:13,142
You can pick Nimmi from
the station at 10:30. - Fine.

1616
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:14,875
I'll be at the station, thank you.

1617
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:16,213
Goodbye.

1618
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,451
Nimmi..talk to me once.

1619
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:22,783
Well..she can at
least talk to me, can't she?

1620
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:24,817
Please tell her, papa.
- I'll explain her.

1621
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,684
Look..l'm already sprouting
a moustache, see.

1622
01:21:26,748 --> 01:21:27,852
I'm trying.

1623
01:21:28,183 --> 01:21:29,457
Nimmi.

1624
01:21:29,618 --> 01:21:31,154
Nimmi, I have a plan.

1625
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:33,523
We'll have our honeymoon
in a helicopter.

1626
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:35,563
And there will be no
third person to disturb us.

1627
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:36,896
Just the two of us.

1628
01:21:37,158 --> 01:21:39,160
But, brother-in-law,
who will fly the helicopter?

1629
01:21:39,494 --> 01:21:40,564
Anyone..what do you care?

1630
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:42,106
Listen, Mohit.

1631
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:45,910
I want you to go for now,
and I'll see you at 12:00.

1632
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:49,577
Until then you'll get big
moustaches like Anil Kapoor.

1633
01:21:49,671 --> 01:21:52,618
Come on..
stop playing games with me Nimmi.

1634
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:54,778
How can I get moustaches
like Anil Kapoor so soon?

1635
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:09,667
Inder.

1636
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,832
We'll be reaching
the station soon.

1637
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,301
My parents will take me back home.

1638
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:16,302
It will all be over.

1639
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:29,482
You won't stop me, will you?

1640
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:38,426
Let's imagine that I do stop you.

1641
01:22:39,187 --> 01:22:40,188
Then?

1642
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:43,432
Then..we may get married.

1643
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:48,335
And maybe 20-25 years later..we'll
be travelling to somewhere like them.

1644
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:50,574
I would be sleeping in your arms.

1645
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:54,837
...and you will be giving
a cute smile like him.

1646
01:22:55,370 --> 01:22:56,405
Just imagine, lnder.

1647
01:22:56,771 --> 01:22:59,843
Yeah..just imagine, Nimmi.

1648
01:23:00,709 --> 01:23:02,484
We'll be neck-deep in debts.

1649
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:05,658
You'll be sick, and I'll divorce
and throw you out of the house.

1650
01:23:05,714 --> 01:23:07,250
Just image.

1651
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:09,818
Why are you always so negative?

1652
01:23:11,453 --> 01:23:15,731
Look, Nimmi..you witnessed
some of their good moments.

1653
01:23:15,824 --> 01:23:17,565
You think this is all very nice.

1654
01:23:17,859 --> 01:23:19,566
I've seen the ugly
side of their relationship.

1655
01:23:19,661 --> 01:23:21,368
But that's how relationships are.

1656
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:23,471
Sometimes they fight,
something they shower love.

1657
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:26,369
I am sure even your parents
had some sweet moments between them.

1658
01:23:26,401 --> 01:23:28,438
"But you never noticed them.

1659
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:32,678
Their fights and quarrels
is the only thing in your head.

1660
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:39,323
You're under a delusion, lnder..

1661
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,556
...and you only see
the negativity of every relation.

1662
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:53,538
Look, Nimmi.

1663
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,942
Maybe..l am delusional.

1664
01:24:00,235 --> 01:24:06,345
But you see a positive sign,
hope..goodness in everylhing.

1665
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:09,788
That's a kind
of illusion as well.

1666
01:24:21,556 --> 01:24:22,796
That's it then, lnder.

1667
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:32,574
I won't come back ever.

1668
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:35,873
It's over.

1669
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,689
Greetings. - Hello. Hello.

1670
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:53,761
See, we're here on time.

1671
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:54,762
Thank you.

1672
01:24:55,290 --> 01:24:56,667
Nimmi, thank God you're here.

1673
01:24:56,958 --> 01:24:58,665
I'm having a tough time
making excuses to Mohit.

1674
01:24:58,693 --> 01:24:59,637
Come on.

1675
01:25:00,028 --> 01:25:01,098
Good girl.

1676
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:49,586
I could never forget
the moments we spent together.

1677
01:25:50,378 --> 01:25:54,554
Though separated..we
couldn't be separated.

1678
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:59,887
You still dwell
somewhere in my hean.

1679
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:04,628
Though separated..we
couldn't be separated.

1680
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:10,566
You still dwell
somewhere in my hean.

1681
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:15,271
Though separated..we
couldn't be separated.

1682
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:30,596
You don't know..the
love that's in my hean.

1683
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:35,632
I don't know
how to pacify my hean.

1684
01:26:36,391 --> 01:26:40,806
I could never forget
the moments we spent together.

1685
01:26:41,462 --> 01:26:45,842
Though separated..we
couldn't be separated.

1686
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:50,947
You still dwell
somewhere in my hean.

1687
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:55,913
Though separated..we
couldn't be separated.

1688
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:10,993
You're an
embodiment of my desires.

1689
01:27:12,293 --> 01:27:16,503
Wherever I
am..you're always close.

1690
01:27:16,831 --> 01:27:19,038
"God knows.."

1691
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:22,381
"God knows.."

1692
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:26,848
"l can never stay away."

1693
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:32,285
Though separated..we
couldn't be separated.

1694
01:27:32,747 --> 01:27:37,025
I could never forget
the moments we spent together.

1695
01:27:37,852 --> 01:27:42,323
Though separated..we
couldn't be separated.

1696
01:27:53,368 --> 01:27:57,316
You're an
embodiment of my desires.

1697
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:02,515
Wherever I
am..you're always close.

1698
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:05,323
"God knows.."

1699
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:08,390
"God knows.."

1700
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:12,756
I could never
erase your memories.

1701
01:28:13,688 --> 01:28:18,034
Though separated..we
couldn't be separated.

1702
01:28:18,793 --> 01:28:23,071
You still dwell
somewhere in my hean.

1703
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:28,037
Though separated..we
couldn't be separated.

1704
01:28:56,097 --> 01:28:57,474
Why didn't you stop her?

1705
01:29:00,134 --> 01:29:02,205
Why do you always associate
your life with mine?

1706
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:06,146
I was helpless.

1707
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:08,484
You think I did it intentionally.

1708
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,420
I don't want to hear your story,
seriously.

1709
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:12,515
This is not a story, lnder.
It's true.

1710
01:29:13,281 --> 01:29:14,282
Now listen.

1711
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,758
'Will you bring the curry
or will I have to eat dry bread?'

1712
01:29:17,251 --> 01:29:20,323
'Your son didn't leave
because I shunned him.'

1713
01:29:20,521 --> 01:29:21,795
'Don't curse me all the time.'

1714
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:26,165
No matter how many times I said,
but she never listened.

1715
01:29:26,694 --> 01:29:28,696
She had become irritable.

1716
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:31,334
Gradually she staned
forgetting things.

1717
01:29:31,366 --> 01:29:32,436
She became careless.

1718
01:29:32,867 --> 01:29:33,902
And we staned fighting.

1719
01:29:34,168 --> 01:29:36,512
'You're always looking
at lnder's books.'

1720
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,175
'Why don't you understand
that he's grown up now?'

1721
01:29:38,272 --> 01:29:40,149
'And he left us to..'

1722
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:43,519
What.'

1723
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:45,715
'She's gone crazy.'

1724
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:48,524
After that..l yelled at her.

1725
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,856
'I told you to turn
off the furnace, did you do it?'

1726
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:52,797
'What furnace?'

1727
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:54,765
'The bakery's furnace, what else?'

1728
01:29:56,557 --> 01:29:57,433
'What happened?'

1729
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:01,764
'My bakery's on fire.
Do something.'

1730
01:30:02,029 --> 01:30:03,235
'It's my only means of living.'

1731
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:04,640
The bakery burned down.

1732
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,513
And I blamed your
mother entirely for it.

1733
01:30:09,437 --> 01:30:10,541
'Get in, be comfortable.'

1734
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:12,412
'Rascal, he'll pay.'

1735
01:30:12,607 --> 01:30:13,642
Get lost.

1736
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:17,552
Your cunning aunty took her home.

1737
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,783
And a month later she
sent me divorce papers.

1738
01:30:21,115 --> 01:30:22,594
I just couldn't understand.

1739
01:30:23,117 --> 01:30:24,391
Divorce..at this age.

1740
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,527
No one had even heard
about it in Kasol.

1741
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:31,968
I was surprised to see your mother's
signatures on the divorce papers.

1742
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,305
'I won't sign.'

1743
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:37,271
'This is the last time
I'm sending you divorce papers.'

1744
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:43,407
'If you don't sign this time..l'll
charge you with domestic violence.'

1745
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:48,544
'And listen..you'll be
jailed without any bail.'

1746
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:52,881
Later I found
out that your aunty..

1747
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:55,554
"Wanted to swindle
the compensation money.

1748
01:30:56,284 --> 01:31:00,357
And even after everylhing, when
they found out about Pammi's ailment.

1749
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:01,728
...do you know what they did?

1750
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:03,825
'Uncle..come
out..where are you?'

1751
01:31:03,891 --> 01:31:08,965
Those rascals left your sick mother
outside my house in the heavy deluge.

1752
01:31:09,330 --> 01:31:10,934
'Come on..'

1753
01:31:11,532 --> 01:31:15,947
'You'll be fine..l'm right here.'

1754
01:31:17,004 --> 01:31:19,382
When Pammi came home I realized..

1755
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:24,853
...that her twitchiness, forgetfulness,
it was all pan of her ailment.

1756
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:28,722
At first I couldn't understand.

1757
01:31:28,983 --> 01:31:31,395
...how I'll arrange
money for her treatment.

1758
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:34,390
I had no other option
other than borrowing money.

1759
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:36,391
The bakery wasn't doing any good.

1760
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:39,705
I borrowed from every man,
every shop, every home in the village.

1761
01:31:40,061 --> 01:31:41,563
But I would still
run shon of money.

1762
01:31:41,729 --> 01:31:43,800
Every month I had
to pay a big amount.

1763
01:31:43,998 --> 01:31:46,604
And I couldn't stop thinking
about what I should do.

1764
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:49,810
That's when I borrowed
money from Chima on interest.

1765
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:52,847
'And listen..if you
fail to return the money..'

1766
01:31:53,341 --> 01:31:55,753
'..then bring the papers
to your house and bakery.'

1767
01:31:57,745 --> 01:32:00,851
You can call this
a story if you like.

1768
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:05,354
Or curse me for
the rest of your life.

1769
01:32:06,053 --> 01:32:07,054
Whatever.

1770
01:32:25,273 --> 01:32:27,310
Mr. Bhalla,
in whose name is the locker?

1771
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:31,456
My wife..Parminder
Singh Bhajanlal Bhalla.

1772
01:32:32,947 --> 01:32:35,188
Here, sign here.

1773
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:37,960
Come on, Pammi..it's a formality.

1774
01:32:38,352 --> 01:32:39,922
Come on, sign here.

1775
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:43,599
D0 it.

1776
01:32:45,593 --> 01:32:47,766
She's not too well.

1777
01:32:47,795 --> 01:32:50,366
Look..mom's not too well.

1778
01:32:50,798 --> 01:32:51,674
Can I sign on her behalf?

1779
01:32:51,933 --> 01:32:53,276
You're not the nominee.

1780
01:32:53,367 --> 01:32:54,937
It's in her name and her brother.

1781
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:57,508
No problem, I'll sign.

1782
01:32:57,638 --> 01:32:58,810
Husband's signature
will do, right?

1783
01:32:58,906 --> 01:33:01,910
Mr. Bhalla, are you joking? - Why?

1784
01:33:02,276 --> 01:33:05,849
In the history of Kasol, there is
just one senior citizen divorce case.

1785
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:06,958
You!

1786
01:33:07,615 --> 01:33:09,822
I won't open the locker
with your signatures.

1787
01:33:09,984 --> 01:33:12,260
Kukreja, you know she's Parminder.

1788
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:13,823
Open the locker, please.

1789
01:33:13,988 --> 01:33:15,626
You'll be booked for fraud.

1790
01:33:15,990 --> 01:33:17,970
For taking your crazy wife's
signature and open her locker.

1791
01:33:18,225 --> 01:33:19,329
Who are you calling crazy?

1792
01:33:19,493 --> 01:33:22,372
Who are you calling crazy?
You're crazy.

1793
01:33:22,496 --> 01:33:24,601
I am not crazy. - Hold on.

1794
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:26,611
Hold on. Calm down.
No one's crazy.

1795
01:33:27,001 --> 01:33:28,639
Calm down, please. Sorry.

1796
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,274
Look.. - Here.

1797
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:33,711
Take mom home.

1798
01:33:34,342 --> 01:33:35,514
I'll talk to him.

1799
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:36,654
Get up, Pammi.

1800
01:33:36,744 --> 01:33:37,848
Nothings wrong with you.

1801
01:33:37,979 --> 01:33:39,287
You're absolutely fine.

1802
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:43,489
What's all this? - I'm very sorry.

1803
01:33:44,518 --> 01:33:48,432
Sir..it's really imponant
for us to open that locker.

1804
01:33:48,723 --> 01:33:50,259
We're in a bit of an emergency.

1805
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:51,829
It's a very complicated case.

1806
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:53,570
There will be
a long legal process.

1807
01:33:53,861 --> 01:33:55,204
It will take around 8-10 months.

1808
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:58,842
Thank you.

1809
01:34:02,403 --> 01:34:05,179
'While running from life,
you come to a turn..'

1810
01:34:05,706 --> 01:34:08,744
'..where you need to stop
before going ahead.'

1811
01:34:10,211 --> 01:34:11,918
'Instead of blaming your kin..'

1812
01:34:12,179 --> 01:34:14,455
'..you need to take a decision.'

1813
01:34:15,383 --> 01:34:19,456
'And choose just one path
out of the many available.'

1814
01:34:23,724 --> 01:34:25,499
Speak up, Bhalla.

1815
01:34:25,860 --> 01:34:28,568
Great. You're speechless now.

1816
01:34:28,763 --> 01:34:29,901
Has the cat got his tongue?

1817
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:32,271
He left me trapped
amongst the police.

1818
01:34:33,534 --> 01:34:35,571
Welcome. Welcome.

1819
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,581
That's called back to pavilion.

1820
01:34:37,672 --> 01:34:38,912
Come.

1821
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:42,216
I got beaten up because of you.

1822
01:34:42,610 --> 01:34:44,556
I was chasing you,
and the police was chasing me.

1823
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:46,656
You two have made my life hell.

1824
01:34:46,881 --> 01:34:49,885
Now I won't let this
mess continue any longer.

1825
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,197
Look, Chima.. - Bhalla, you..

1826
01:34:55,756 --> 01:34:57,929
Don't you dare raise
your hand on him.

1827
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:02,498
Or else I will beat you up.

1828
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,268
Beat you up badly.

1829
01:35:06,600 --> 01:35:07,601
Get that.

1830
01:35:07,968 --> 01:35:09,777
Let's finish this dispute.

1831
01:35:10,271 --> 01:35:11,841
Give me the bakery papers..
- Yeah, sign it.

1832
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:13,282
You won't sign.

1833
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:15,818
Hey dude..stop it now.

1834
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:16,718
Don't create a new problem.

1835
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:18,017
I am not creating a new problem.

1836
01:35:18,813 --> 01:35:20,019
You want money, don't you?

1837
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:21,351
I have a plan.

1838
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:35,673
Come on. - What's wrong, boss?

1839
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:38,369
He's asked for four more days.

1840
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:39,706
Four days?

1841
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:42,681
What's all this?

1842
01:35:43,504 --> 01:35:45,780
Look..l'll sign on the papers.

1843
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,449
Take your mother with
you..and make your music album.

1844
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:51,055
There's no need for that.

1845
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:52,651
We'll get the money.

1846
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:56,285
We will? But how?

1847
01:35:57,284 --> 01:35:59,321
By getting married.
- Getting married?

1848
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:00,826
Whose marriage?

1849
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:03,227
Mother.

1850
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:05,435
Mother?

1851
01:36:06,093 --> 01:36:07,834
We need a marriage certificate.

1852
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:09,433
If mother remarries.

1853
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:12,306
...we'll get a new marriage cenificate
along with her new husband.

1854
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:15,541
She.. - And the bank
will have to open the locker.

1855
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:19,512
Sit. Sit.

1856
01:36:22,777 --> 01:36:24,313
Now take a good look at him.

1857
01:36:27,214 --> 01:36:28,488
I've chosen him for you.

1858
01:36:31,152 --> 01:36:33,325
Age, 60..fair complexion.

1859
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,066
7th class fail.

1860
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:41,602
He runs a bakery..which
doesn't do too good.

1861
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:46,472
He doesn't drink or smoke.

1862
01:36:47,268 --> 01:36:50,806
But he's addicted to
solving crossword puzzles.

1863
01:36:53,574 --> 01:36:55,110
His knees are weak.

1864
01:36:56,677 --> 01:37:00,284
But he can still dance
really well if he's in the mood.

1865
01:37:04,685 --> 01:37:06,460
He's got a bladder
problem as well.

1866
01:37:07,588 --> 01:37:09,534
Wants to pee
after every 30 minutes.

1867
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:14,162
He's also a loud-mouth.

1868
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,605
But has a hean of gold.

1869
01:37:24,305 --> 01:37:26,683
So do you accept this proposal?

1870
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:34,350
Will you marry my papa?

1871
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:04,488
Come on.

1872
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:06,816
Now you two are going
to have a grand wedding.

1873
01:38:07,214 --> 01:38:08,625
Grand wedding?

1874
01:38:08,749 --> 01:38:11,252
Where are you going to get
the money for a grand wedding?

1875
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:13,256
What's Chima for?

1876
01:38:13,787 --> 01:38:16,063
Chima?

1877
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:20,197
Suit..but I never wore one
of those. - You will wear it now.

1878
01:38:20,461 --> 01:38:22,668
Mister, this one.. - 5000 rupees.

1879
01:38:22,763 --> 01:38:23,537
5000?

1880
01:38:23,631 --> 01:38:24,405
5000.. - It's alright.

1881
01:38:24,465 --> 01:38:25,409
Chima, pay him.

1882
01:38:25,599 --> 01:38:26,669
Take his measurements. - Rascal.

1883
01:38:30,337 --> 01:38:32,112
Come on, pay him.

1884
01:38:32,172 --> 01:38:33,549
Don't just stand there.
- Come on, Chima.

1885
01:38:33,741 --> 01:38:35,345
We're not paying him.

1886
01:38:36,143 --> 01:38:37,588
Note it down..5000 rupees.

1887
01:38:45,252 --> 01:38:55,162
O companiomjust
a little longer.

1888
01:38:55,596 --> 01:39:03,606
The destination of
love's calling out to thee.

1889
01:39:25,659 --> 01:39:35,341
O companiomjust
a little longer.

1890
01:39:36,203 --> 01:39:45,487
The destination of
love's calling out to thee.

1891
01:39:56,023 --> 01:40:04,773
I am neither unfaithfuLnor
is there a dearth of love.

1892
01:40:06,066 --> 01:40:14,816
But our destinies..are
completely separate.

1893
01:40:16,276 --> 01:40:25,128
"How will I find my destination of love?"

1894
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:35,431
O companiomjust
a little longer.

1895
01:40:36,764 --> 01:40:44,706
The destination of
love's calling out to thee.

1896
01:40:46,774 --> 01:40:47,752
How is it?

1897
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:49,082
No.

1898
01:40:49,410 --> 01:40:50,115
This?

1899
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:52,620
And this?

1900
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:55,750
Chima.

1901
01:40:58,652 --> 01:40:59,460
It should be done overnight.

1902
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:01,294
Okay? - Fine.

1903
01:41:01,622 --> 01:41:04,193
Inder, I am Ronnie's father.

1904
01:41:04,391 --> 01:41:05,768
Didn't you recognize me?

1905
01:41:06,126 --> 01:41:07,230
Hello, uncle. - Bless you, son.

1906
01:41:07,594 --> 01:41:09,130
Good you're back, son.

1907
01:41:09,296 --> 01:41:11,071
Your father troubled me to death.

1908
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:13,272
He would land at my
threshold every morning..

1909
01:41:13,634 --> 01:41:17,172
...and say ask your son
Ronnie how's my son lnder.

1910
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:18,144
What's he doing?

1911
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:19,808
What's he eating?
What's he drinking?

1912
01:41:20,140 --> 01:41:21,346
Is he fine out there?

1913
01:41:22,676 --> 01:41:24,553
Now that you're here..l
can breathe a sigh of relief.

1914
01:41:25,245 --> 01:41:25,848
Okay, son.

1915
01:41:26,613 --> 01:41:27,455
See you.

1916
01:41:27,481 --> 01:41:28,482
Come.

1917
01:41:28,682 --> 01:41:30,127
He's a great boy.

1918
01:41:33,153 --> 01:41:38,193
"Punjabi wedding folk song."

1919
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:45,369
"Punjabi wedding folk song."

1920
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:52,406
"Punjabi wedding folk song."

1921
01:41:52,539 --> 01:41:59,684
"Punjabi wedding folk song."

1922
01:43:45,819 --> 01:43:48,095
lnder, it's a good
thing that you came back.

1923
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:50,868
Your mother's condition is
so much better because of you.

1924
01:43:55,128 --> 01:43:57,233
Listen..don't throw too much.

1925
01:43:57,464 --> 01:43:58,841
We paid for all this.

1926
01:43:59,166 --> 01:44:00,201
One petal at a time.

1927
01:44:00,334 --> 01:44:01,176
Come on.

1928
01:44:01,535 --> 01:44:02,309
One..

1929
01:44:03,637 --> 01:44:04,547
Throw it.

1930
01:44:20,721 --> 01:44:21,426
Hello. - Hello.

1931
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:22,465
Welcome.

1932
01:44:24,124 --> 01:44:25,194
Let's go.

1933
01:44:29,730 --> 01:44:31,334
Both are looking nice.

1934
01:44:31,665 --> 01:44:32,541
<i>Boss.</i>

1935
01:44:33,200 --> 01:44:34,736
<i>Boss,</i> lnder's missing.

1936
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:38,547
Why are you
whispering it in my ears?

1937
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:39,843
Bhalla.

1938
01:44:40,307 --> 01:44:41,411
Shut up, priest.

1939
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:44,951
Hey..where's your son?

1940
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:47,723
He must be somewhere around here.

1941
01:44:47,748 --> 01:44:49,955
Why? - He isn't here. He ran away.

1942
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:52,288
Ran away.
No, no..he must be here.

1943
01:44:52,419 --> 01:44:55,457
Inder. - Listen,
don't 30*" with me anymore.

1944
01:44:55,589 --> 01:44:56,431
Get that.

1945
01:44:56,523 --> 01:45:00,266
Your son promised to pay
up right after the marriage.

1946
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:02,202
He made me pay for
all the wedding expenses.

1947
01:45:02,729 --> 01:45:03,605
Let's go.

1948
01:45:03,730 --> 01:45:06,233
We won't spare him this time.

1949
01:45:12,372 --> 01:45:13,407
He's here.

1950
01:45:20,847 --> 01:45:21,757
Your money!

1951
01:45:24,217 --> 01:45:24,922
Inder..

1952
01:45:27,254 --> 01:45:28,528
It's all there.

1953
01:45:29,256 --> 01:45:29,927
Should be 2.2 million.

1954
01:45:30,190 --> 01:45:30,895
Yes?

1955
01:45:31,725 --> 01:45:33,432
Where did you get the money from?

1956
01:45:33,927 --> 01:45:35,770
The banks stay
closed at this hour.

1957
01:45:40,734 --> 01:45:44,944
Papa..we were never going to
get the money from the bank anyway.

1958
01:45:46,606 --> 01:45:47,744
Due to mom's condition.

1959
01:45:47,841 --> 01:45:49,752
"They don't consider
this marriage legal.

1960
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:52,854
Anyway.. - No, I want to know..

1961
01:45:52,913 --> 01:45:55,792
Bhalla sir..forget it,
Bhalla sir.

1962
01:45:55,916 --> 01:45:57,452
We've got the money, so be happy.

1963
01:45:57,517 --> 01:45:58,928
Think about the results,
not the method.

1964
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:00,890
Congratulations on your wedding.

1965
01:46:01,254 --> 01:46:02,392
Thank you, lnder.

1966
01:46:02,589 --> 01:46:03,465
Where are you going?

1967
01:46:03,690 --> 01:46:04,930
You can't leave
without having sweets.

1968
01:46:04,958 --> 01:46:06,869
And I still have to give
them their wedding gift.

1969
01:46:07,794 --> 01:46:08,772
Come on.

1970
01:46:09,363 --> 01:46:10,307
Come.

1971
01:46:39,259 --> 01:46:40,260
You..

1972
01:46:42,362 --> 01:46:43,841
The board had become too rusty.

1973
01:46:44,464 --> 01:46:46,205
So I took some
time to take it down.

1974
01:46:46,700 --> 01:46:48,202
But it will never come down again.

1975
01:46:49,703 --> 01:46:51,842
But when did you do this?

1976
01:46:52,172 --> 01:46:53,276
I never realized..

1977
01:46:53,874 --> 01:46:55,478
First come in and take a look.

1978
01:46:55,776 --> 01:46:57,187
Come on. - Come.

1979
01:46:57,711 --> 01:46:58,485
Come, mom.

1980
01:47:09,489 --> 01:47:12,936
WhaLwas the"

1981
01:47:13,326 --> 01:47:15,237
What was the need
to do all this? Why?

1982
01:47:15,395 --> 01:47:16,373
Come.

1983
01:47:16,696 --> 01:47:17,367
Come on.

1984
01:47:17,397 --> 01:47:19,843
Take a look.. - You wanted to work
for the rest of your life.

1985
01:47:20,233 --> 01:47:21,303
And never retire.

1986
01:47:21,401 --> 01:47:22,778
Yes. - Come sit.

1987
01:47:23,570 --> 01:47:24,640
Sit down.

1988
01:47:26,907 --> 01:47:29,478
Now no one's going to retire you.

1989
01:47:30,243 --> 01:47:32,621
All this money..

1990
01:47:32,879 --> 01:47:35,723
I suggest that you sell this
bakery and make something of yourself.

1991
01:47:36,483 --> 01:47:38,588
Let me rectify my mistakes today.

1992
01:47:38,819 --> 01:47:39,889
You didn't make any mistakes.

1993
01:47:40,153 --> 01:47:40,893
No mistakes at all.

1994
01:47:41,354 --> 01:47:42,298
Lies.

1995
01:47:43,857 --> 01:47:46,701
Why did you never
talk to me openly?

1996
01:47:47,227 --> 01:47:49,434
Always kept
everylhing to yourself?

1997
01:47:50,864 --> 01:47:53,606
Why didn't you call me
even once in all these years?

1998
01:47:53,934 --> 01:47:56,471
Every day you asked Ronnie's
father about my well-being..

1999
01:47:56,670 --> 01:47:58,274
"But never talked to me.

2000
01:47:58,538 --> 01:48:01,883
I didn't because
I was angry with you.

2001
01:48:11,251 --> 01:48:12,753
I had a tough time
setting up this bakery.

2002
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:14,198
But who did I do it for?

2003
01:48:15,589 --> 01:48:19,901
I thought if you joined
me..my bakery would be the best.

2004
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:23,402
It would be no.1.

2005
01:48:24,764 --> 01:48:28,337
But I never thought that you
wanted something else from your life.

2006
01:48:28,768 --> 01:48:30,372
And there was nothing wrong in it.

2007
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:34,918
It's not necessary that
a doctor's son becomes a doctor.

2008
01:48:35,175 --> 01:48:36,620
...or a lawyer's
son becomes a lawyer.

2009
01:48:37,177 --> 01:48:40,249
If a baker's son doesn't want
to be a baker, it's nothing wrong.

2010
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:41,951
You were right.

2011
01:48:43,216 --> 01:48:45,423
I never acted like a father.

2012
01:48:46,920 --> 01:48:49,662
Never thought what's
going on in your mind.

2013
01:48:50,857 --> 01:48:55,397
I thought you're just
a means to fulfill my dreams.

2014
01:48:58,465 --> 01:49:00,877
You did the right
thing that you left me.

2015
01:49:01,868 --> 01:49:05,714
Here..you would've
become like me. Hopeless.

2016
01:49:06,973 --> 01:49:08,611
I am just like you.

2017
01:49:11,278 --> 01:49:13,224
All my life I kept running
away from this fact.

2018
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:15,692
...because I knew
I am just like you.

2019
01:49:15,815 --> 01:49:19,922
Your stubbornness, your temper,
your ego, your insecurities.

2020
01:49:20,287 --> 01:49:21,823
...l have all that.

2021
01:49:22,923 --> 01:49:24,869
The only difference is..

2022
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:27,728
I am selfish.

2023
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:33,939
I never thought.

2024
01:49:37,304 --> 01:49:39,250
...about the conditions.

2025
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:42,517
...and difficulties
you'd be facing.

2026
01:49:51,017 --> 01:49:52,496
Or how's mom?

2027
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:00,003
In fact..l came here
for my own selfish gains.

2028
01:50:04,965 --> 01:50:06,808
I couldn't be a good son.

2029
01:50:13,373 --> 01:50:14,818
I am sorry, Papa-

2030
01:50:20,680 --> 01:50:21,556
Come here.

2031
01:50:32,826 --> 01:50:35,568
No, son.

2032
01:50:37,831 --> 01:50:42,405
Thanks to you..for the first
time in my life I'm looking good.

2033
01:50:44,137 --> 01:50:45,741
There are no flaws in you, son.

2034
01:50:47,173 --> 01:50:49,153
You've exceeded everyone by far.

2035
01:50:50,343 --> 01:50:53,620
These days if the parents
want to go on a pilgrimage.

2036
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,459
"Their children buy a ticket
for them and say "Go ahead".

2037
01:50:58,485 --> 01:51:01,398
But you..carried your
parents on your shoulder..

2038
01:51:02,088 --> 01:51:04,329
...and also took them around.

2039
01:51:05,859 --> 01:51:10,672
What you did is much better
than going on a pilgrimage.

2040
01:51:11,297 --> 01:51:13,174
Bless you, son. Bless you.

2041
01:51:15,535 --> 01:51:19,574
That Chima..was right.

2042
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:22,380
"Here comes your Shravan Kumar."

2043
01:51:22,676 --> 01:51:24,280
"Modern Shravan Kumar."

2044
01:51:24,644 --> 01:51:26,214
Our Shravan Kumar.

2045
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:35,465
Tell me something.

2046
01:51:36,690 --> 01:51:39,864
Where did you get
the money to do all this?

2047
01:51:40,393 --> 01:51:41,565
Where?

2048
01:51:45,732 --> 01:51:47,143
You sold your songs, didn't you?

2049
01:51:47,534 --> 01:51:48,808
Didn't you?

2050
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:52,877
Those were just songs.
I'll compose new ones.

2051
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:58,318
And this time I'll
make them even better.

2052
01:51:58,645 --> 01:52:02,559
You'll make better
songs..but not relations.

2053
01:52:02,849 --> 01:52:04,522
Nimmi's wedding is today.

2054
01:52:04,751 --> 01:52:06,697
There's still time..go stop her.

2055
01:52:06,886 --> 01:52:09,594
Go get her.

2056
01:52:10,223 --> 01:52:11,827
It's pointless now. - Why?

2057
01:52:12,492 --> 01:52:13,766
The marriage must be over by now?

2058
01:52:14,227 --> 01:52:15,763
We'll get sister-in-law
before the send-off.

2059
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:21,572
It's a four hour drive..
I'll get you there in two hours.

2060
01:52:23,903 --> 01:52:24,506
<i>Boss, police.</i>

2061
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:26,209
Come on, hurry up. - Catch them.

2062
01:52:26,272 --> 01:52:28,513
There's Chima's goons. Stop.

2063
01:52:29,175 --> 01:52:31,416
See, I told you
we'll find Chima here.

2064
01:52:31,444 --> 01:52:32,821
Catch them. - Yes, sir.

2065
01:52:33,913 --> 01:52:35,586
Mr. Bhalla,
congratulations on your wedding.

2066
01:52:36,516 --> 01:52:37,426
Catch them.

2067
01:52:37,450 --> 01:52:38,520
Stop.

2068
01:52:40,520 --> 01:52:42,864
We must leave now.
Arrange for a car.

2069
01:53:29,002 --> 01:53:31,744
I think..we're late.

2070
01:53:32,872 --> 01:53:34,408
The ceremonies are over.

2071
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:41,984
Nimmi!

2072
01:53:43,049 --> 01:53:44,460
You're still here.

2073
01:53:45,718 --> 01:53:47,789
Uncle, what are you doing here?

2074
01:53:47,887 --> 01:53:49,662
What are you
still doing here? - Yes.

2075
01:53:50,723 --> 01:53:51,758
This is my home.

2076
01:53:52,725 --> 01:53:53,863
Where else can I go?

2077
01:53:54,561 --> 01:53:56,063
I'll be spending the
rest of my life right here.

2078
01:53:56,396 --> 01:53:59,809
But you..were supposed
to marry Mohit.

2079
01:54:02,435 --> 01:54:05,075
Mohit got married. - Got married.

2080
01:54:06,072 --> 01:54:06,948
What?

2081
01:54:08,875 --> 01:54:11,947
I mean..the day I returned
from the station..

2082
01:54:12,745 --> 01:54:14,850
Nimmi, try to understand.
Listen.

2083
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:16,960
Mohit saw me coming back.

2084
01:54:18,051 --> 01:54:21,089
And he knew that he
wasn't talking to Nimmi..

2085
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:22,695
"But Bubbly,
who was posing as Nimmi.

2086
01:54:23,957 --> 01:54:25,698
Mohit is looking so handsome.

2087
01:54:27,026 --> 01:54:29,973
Mom, I want to marry
Bubbly and not Nimmi.

2088
01:54:34,968 --> 01:54:36,003
I don't mind!

2089
01:54:42,742 --> 01:54:43,447
Oh..

2090
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:53,654
Dear..

2091
01:54:55,989 --> 01:54:58,492
Will you marry my son?

2092
01:54:58,591 --> 01:55:00,798
Will you? Please?

2093
01:55:08,301 --> 01:55:09,371
Then what?

2094
01:55:09,435 --> 01:55:11,711
Finally I had to accept what
I kept running from all my life.

2095
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:18,718
When things are destined
to happen, why run from it?

2096
01:55:22,282 --> 01:55:25,354
I made three music albums,
and they were all chanbusters.

2097
01:55:25,518 --> 01:55:27,520
Aren't you lnder, the Singer?

2098
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:28,496
Autograph please.

2099
01:55:31,190 --> 01:55:34,933
Chima. He's still confused
whether he's our friend or enemy.

2100
01:55:35,328 --> 01:55:38,866
The money we gave him,
he invested those in our bakery again.

2101
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:42,407
And he takes his
share from the profit.

2102
01:55:44,871 --> 01:55:46,475
Son, how are you?

2103
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:49,415
How was your show in Delhi?
- Super hit..sold out, papa.

2104
01:55:49,642 --> 01:55:50,916
Hail Goddess.

2105
01:55:51,177 --> 01:55:51,917
Hi, baby.

2106
01:55:52,211 --> 01:55:55,249
Mama-Papa - Hey,
son..how are you?

2107
01:55:55,415 --> 01:55:57,258
Oh, God..l completely forgot.

2108
01:55:57,517 --> 01:55:58,222
What happened?

2109
01:55:58,418 --> 01:55:59,863
Grandma, your medicine.

2110
01:56:00,153 --> 01:56:03,225
And your sonny..takes
good care of his grandma.

2111
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:06,427
That journey taught me that even
if there are problems in the family..

2112
01:56:06,592 --> 01:56:10,768
...If we try to solve them instead of
run away, the family will never break.

2113
01:56:10,863 --> 01:56:13,742
If everyone lives together,
keeps the parents happy..

2114
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:15,345
"Then you will be happy always.

2115
01:56:15,535 --> 01:56:16,605
And all will be well.

2116
01:56:32,685 --> 01:56:35,529
"Break all the rules."

2117
01:56:35,588 --> 01:56:38,262
"Do what you never did before."

2118
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:40,665
If you're in
the mood to party.

2119
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:43,832
"Don't wait for
the weekend to come.

2120
01:56:50,103 --> 01:56:52,777
"Break all the rules."

2121
01:56:53,039 --> 01:56:55,542
"Do what you never did before."

2122
01:56:55,742 --> 01:56:58,120
If you're in
the mood to party.

2123
01:56:58,211 --> 01:57:00,748
"Don't wait for
the weekend to come.

2124
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:05,320
Everyone should have
this common thought.

2125
01:57:07,120 --> 01:57:09,794
There should be four
Saturdays in a week.

2126
01:57:12,792 --> 01:57:15,739
There should be four
Saturdays in a week.

2127
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:41,826
"Saturdaymot one but four."

2128
01:57:49,829 --> 01:57:52,742
Could it ever be..that
the sun's on a holiday.

2129
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:55,540
"And time's in our control."

2130
01:57:55,668 --> 01:57:58,512
In a long
limo..we've have a blast.

2131
01:57:58,538 --> 01:58:01,417
"With a beauty in our arms."

2132
01:58:01,507 --> 01:58:05,853
The speaker's
volume should be high.

2133
01:58:07,613 --> 01:58:10,457
There should be four
Saturdays in a week.

2134
01:58:10,516 --> 01:58:13,190
"Four."

2135
01:58:13,453 --> 01:58:16,195
There should be four
Saturdays in a week.

2136
01:58:16,389 --> 01:58:19,165
"Four."

2137
01:58:22,128 --> 01:58:24,836
I said let's panynwhy
don't you listen to me.

2138
01:58:24,864 --> 01:58:27,538
Life is too
short-lived to waste.

2139
01:58:27,733 --> 01:58:30,612
"Stop being shy and scared."

2140
01:58:30,703 --> 01:58:33,547
Break the rules
and the dance floor.

2141
01:58:33,673 --> 01:58:35,414
It's your boy Badshah.

2142
01:58:36,542 --> 01:58:39,318
When the music
plays..you'll stan dancing.

2143
01:58:39,412 --> 01:58:42,222
I'll give you a tight
slap..if you talk nonsense.

2144
01:58:42,315 --> 01:58:44,659
Those who don't want to party
can go to hell.

2145
01:58:44,717 --> 01:58:47,459
Boys in the house,
baby..All is Well.

2146
01:58:47,587 --> 01:58:53,299
365 days in a year..but
only 52 Saturdays.

2147
01:58:53,426 --> 01:58:56,202
Flush the calendarjorget
all the rush.

2148
01:58:56,262 --> 01:58:58,902
"Youth is too shon to waste."

2149
01:58:59,232 --> 01:59:03,442
World-wide you should
preach only one thing.

2150
01:59:05,271 --> 01:59:08,445
There should be four
Saturdays in a week.

2151
01:59:10,943 --> 01:59:14,288
There should be four
Saturdays in a week.

2152
01:59:28,194 --> 01:59:29,798
"Allis Well."
