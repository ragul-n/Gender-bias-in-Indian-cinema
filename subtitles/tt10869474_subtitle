1
00:05:32,776 --> 00:05:33,965
Aunt, come fast.

2
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:36,419
Oh! Father, look at this.

3
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,245
Sreya, come fast.

4
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:43,427
You have to go to school.

5
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,114
Come on.

6
00:06:07,126 --> 00:06:08,790
"Good morning Kochi."

7
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:12,640
"Isn't it through mornings like 
this that vanished evenings reincarnate?"

8
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:16,273
"It's 6.30 on the clock and 
it's RJ Abhishekh on air"

9
00:06:16,406 --> 00:06:18,101
Wishing you a wonderful morning.

10
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,847
You must be all reading the newspaper.

11
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:23,027
There is a hot news in the newspapers.

12
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:27,219
Our collector's 'Operation Sulaimani' 
has become a huge success.

13
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,461
A big salute to all those who made 
this noble cause a great success.

14
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:08,316
Aunt, I'm leaving.

15
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:09,889
Don't go. I'm coming.

16
00:07:17,202 --> 00:07:19,272
Sreya, at least have this.

17
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,530
It's your father's death anniversary today.

18
00:07:22,577 --> 00:07:25,195
I had gone to the temple. 
That's why I got late.

19
00:07:27,465 --> 00:07:29,200
-Drink this fully. 
-I'll eat from out.

20
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:29,702
You can take him later.

21
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:38,138
I'll call you.

22
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:39,792
Sir, you'll be there to help, right?

23
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:44,775
-Sreya 
-Yes, sir.

24
00:08:45,528 --> 00:08:46,294
Come in.

25
00:08:53,107 --> 00:08:55,865
All the details you asked 
for is there in it.

26
00:08:59,826 --> 00:09:00,935
What do you want to drink?

27
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,709
Nothing.

28
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:06,363
Don't expect any support 
from the government.

29
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:11,657
If such a big incident has 
happened before our eyes,

30
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:17,445
there is someone powerful behind it.

31
00:09:20,739 --> 00:09:22,072
The trust manager...

32
00:09:23,184 --> 00:09:24,184
Idikula.

33
00:09:24,317 --> 00:09:25,317
He is missing.

34
00:09:26,075 --> 00:09:27,811
Is there any way to contact him?

35
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,979
It's an organization run in 
memory of my ancestors.

36
00:09:34,638 --> 00:09:36,629
It was passed down through generations.

37
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:38,450
Now there...

38
00:09:40,674 --> 00:09:44,184
The downfall of the trust 
started when he joined.

39
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:52,248
Sorry, sir.

40
00:09:52,693 --> 00:09:55,161
Twenty one cases of sexual 
abuse have been reported.

41
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,121
Inquiry must be done.

42
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:06,254
This inquiry is my personal need.

43
00:10:08,173 --> 00:10:12,163
If at least one of the girls 
is saying the truth,

44
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,711
whomever be the person behind it,

45
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:17,185
he must be punished.

46
00:10:18,016 --> 00:10:19,016
Yes. Okay.

47
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:21,488
I'm leaving.

48
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:24,788
Sir, your medicine.

49
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:32,218
Look who's here. Sreya IPS.

50
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:35,489
You do modeling? You're really photogenic.

51
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,095
If you record a selfie video 
and give, we'll make it viral.

52
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:40,470
Don't you know him? 
He's from 'Manjakili Media'

53
00:10:41,037 --> 00:10:46,025
If the content is strong, 
it'll definitely go viral.

54
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,775
I call him woodpecker.

55
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:51,868
His social media group has 
2.5 lakh genuine followers.

56
00:10:52,787 --> 00:10:53,787
Let's rock.

57
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:56,778
You must have come to meet my father.

58
00:10:57,793 --> 00:11:00,972
Why do you come to meet 
him for everything?

59
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:02,118
Is there any use?

60
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,064
If you want publicity,

61
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:06,359
Look here. Mallu girl in police uniform.

62
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:11,409
Come.

63
00:11:23,075 --> 00:11:24,580
Where have you been?

64
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:29,362
I had gone to maintain your reputation.

65
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:32,074
Inauguration of a health club.

66
00:11:32,663 --> 00:11:35,171
Health, Peace and Development. 
Isn't that our aim?

67
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:38,629
Hope you know that they have started 
inquiry on Devanathan Trust.

68
00:11:40,817 --> 00:11:41,682
I got to know now.

69
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:43,332
Aren't you happy?

70
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,501
Development will happen.

71
00:11:46,015 --> 00:11:47,015
Yes.

72
00:11:47,968 --> 00:11:50,858
Development through your short cuts.

73
00:11:52,269 --> 00:11:53,536
It's not one or two.

74
00:11:54,394 --> 00:11:56,634
Twenty one girls have given complaint.

75
00:11:58,192 --> 00:11:59,160
Hope you know that.

76
00:12:01,106 --> 00:12:03,317
Mahadeva (Lord Siva) is 
the lord of everything.

77
00:12:04,199 --> 00:12:05,399
Haven't you heard it?

78
00:12:06,632 --> 00:12:07,632
Gone?

79
00:12:08,452 --> 00:12:09,428
It's a good quote.

80
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:10,853
It'd make an awesome status.

81
00:12:28,692 --> 00:12:29,692
Good morning.

82
00:12:34,206 --> 00:12:36,182
-Deepan, good morning. 
-Good morning.

83
00:12:36,239 --> 00:12:37,840
Tomorrow is the inauguration 
of the auditorium, right?

84
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:38,371
Yes.

85
00:12:38,395 --> 00:12:41,106
I need the VIP list and the security 
measurements. We need to discuss it.

86
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:42,012
Sure.

87
00:12:42,036 --> 00:12:44,004
We'll come there once Vani becomes free.

88
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:45,415
What's the case today?

89
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,622
A high profile petty case.

90
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,433
Come soon.

91
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:50,391
I can't keep going to the 
police station anymore.

92
00:13:52,337 --> 00:13:55,681
I want to know what 
happened to my daughter.

93
00:13:56,501 --> 00:13:57,501
That's all.

94
00:13:59,203 --> 00:14:01,585
You should try for that.

95
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,320
Okay?

96
00:14:03,937 --> 00:14:04,937
Yes.

97
00:14:11,272 --> 00:14:12,116
Sreya...

98
00:14:12,515 --> 00:14:13,515
We are here.

99
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:19,939
Where is Savan?

100
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,634
He has gone for a local 
search to find Idikula.

101
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:25,087
He'll join us.

102
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,522
Please be on standby for him.

103
00:14:26,819 --> 00:14:30,385
From what MLA has told, this case 
can turn high profile any moment.

104
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:32,676
Tomorrow is the inauguration, right?

105
00:14:32,981 --> 00:14:35,041
Who's leading central minister's security?

106
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,922
Security measures have been taken.

107
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,711
But there is a last minute 
change in the program.

108
00:14:40,023 --> 00:14:42,992
Minister is not coming. 
He has got some urgent meeting in Delhi.

109
00:14:43,386 --> 00:14:46,596
Instead of him MLA 
Vamadevan is inaugurating.

110
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:53,191
Also social activist Arundathi and Kozhikode 
Collector Nishanth Nair are attending.

111
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,503
So as per the protocol I 
don't need to be there.

112
00:15:02,505 --> 00:15:03,850
This is the list.

113
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,903
Complete details of the victims, including 
their name and photo are there in it.

114
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,560
Did you check the authenticity as well?

115
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:11,527
Yes everything is fine. 
You can have a look.

116
00:16:47,565 --> 00:16:48,565
YOU!

117
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:50,362
Leave her.

118
00:16:50,557 --> 00:16:51,979
Leave my daughter.

119
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,596
Leave her.

120
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,968
What did you do to my daughter?

121
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:58,315
Leave her.

122
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:02,385
Leave her.

123
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:11,317
Don't do anything to my daughter.

124
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:16,579
I told you...

125
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:52,439
"A 13 year old girl has gone 
missing from Nadakavu junction"

126
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:57,005
"This girl shown in the photo is a 
student of Nadakavu Girl's School"

127
00:17:57,823 --> 00:18:00,356
"Since cases like this have increased,

128
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:05,213
the Deputy Commissioner told a new team 
has been given charge of these cases"

129
00:18:06,183 --> 00:18:10,894
"Any information about this girl should 
be passed to the nearby police station"

130
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:33,147
With your permission.

131
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:42,923
We need to surround ourselves with 
people who believe in positive changes.

132
00:18:43,971 --> 00:18:47,619
That's all we need to bring 
out our true potential.

133
00:18:48,353 --> 00:18:53,188
With this positive thinking, we can 
find solutions even for big problems.

134
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:57,678
We need in our society not just the 
people who point out the problems...

135
00:18:57,991 --> 00:19:00,326
but also those people who 
find a solution for it.

136
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,387
Solution providers like you.

137
00:19:02,536 --> 00:19:04,036
You! And you all!

138
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:06,801
Thank you.

139
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:16,664
Now I welcome Ms. Arundathi, women 
empowerment department's national head,

140
00:19:16,982 --> 00:19:18,782
a true leader and an influencer.

141
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:22,387
Like Mr. Nishanth said, a real solution provider.

142
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:23,788
Please ma'am.

143
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:35,657
When I was invited for the 
inauguration of this auditorium,

144
00:19:36,514 --> 00:19:38,296
the main reason for accepting it is that,

145
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:43,399
I'd get some time to interact 
with my little friends.

146
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:49,175
I don't know how to speak 
like our eminent guests.

147
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,958
I'm one among you.

148
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,025
In my school...

149
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:02,274
sitting on the last bench over there...

150
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:06,759
I used to listen to eminent people.

151
00:20:07,514 --> 00:20:13,666
I curiously listened and wondered if I'd 
be able to speak like them someday.

152
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,331
Because I wasn't confident.

153
00:20:17,578 --> 00:20:21,059
I needed a genuine reason 
to get that confidence.

154
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,533
It was the boys in my class 
who made me find it.

155
00:20:26,822 --> 00:20:29,489
There was a big jamun tree 
in my school playground.

156
00:20:30,235 --> 00:20:36,705
The stubbornness of the boys to climb 
the tree and eat the jamun from it.

157
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:43,808
For the girls, the goal was to catch the 
fruit before it fell on the ground.

158
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,816
I tried to climb up the tree many times. 
But I failed.

159
00:20:49,103 --> 00:20:51,603
My friends mocked and laughed at me.

160
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:54,914
But after many failures, I 
climbed the tree one day.

161
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:03,892
The sweetest fruit I've eaten in my life 
is the jamun I plucked on that day.

162
00:21:10,904 --> 00:21:15,971
After finishing college, I founded an 
organization called Women for Women.

163
00:21:16,078 --> 00:21:19,478
It's a big organization 
with around 2000 women.

164
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:28,243
It was that jamun tree on my school ground 
that gave me the confidence for it.

165
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,477
This is what I want to tell you.

166
00:21:32,085 --> 00:21:34,712
In order to achieve your goal...

167
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:40,928
Let you all get the confidence for 
it from your school days itself.

168
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:48,342
Trust me.

169
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,383
The fruits are sweeter from up here.

170
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:52,336
Thank you.

171
00:21:55,494 --> 00:22:00,931
Now I request Vamadevan sir to 
handover the cheque to Ms. Arundathi.

172
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:12,970
Thank you sir!

173
00:22:14,517 --> 00:22:17,509
Don't worry. There is no other problem.

174
00:22:17,989 --> 00:22:21,757
Thanks a lot, dear. It's because 
of you that we got this.

175
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:24,297
We'll always remember what 
you have done for us.

176
00:22:24,514 --> 00:22:26,771
That is okay. It's my job.

177
00:22:27,197 --> 00:22:30,206
Now don't worry. Just be happy.

178
00:22:30,377 --> 00:22:31,960
Call me if there is anything.

179
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,016
-See you dear. 
-Okay.

180
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,860
Careful.

181
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,221
Take this.

182
00:23:15,081 --> 00:23:16,081
Amina...

183
00:23:16,748 --> 00:23:17,660
I'm Sinimol.

184
00:23:18,687 --> 00:23:20,215
Just brief her. I'll check and come.

185
00:23:21,578 --> 00:23:22,875
Don't worry.

186
00:23:23,516 --> 00:23:26,049
Didn't you save your daughter on time?

187
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:29,428
Just think what would have happened 
if you hadn't got there on time?

188
00:23:29,932 --> 00:23:30,932
Madam...

189
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:34,872
He'd promised to take care of us.

190
00:23:35,562 --> 00:23:36,562
He...

191
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,677
I'll give the medicine for him correctly.

192
00:23:39,912 --> 00:23:41,986
He won't touch you or your daughter again.

193
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:45,269
And don't get frightened by seeing this.

194
00:23:45,436 --> 00:23:48,623
We are all there to give 
Saira a good future.

195
00:23:48,756 --> 00:23:50,138
We are all there with you.

196
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:54,076
It's over there. The third room.

197
00:23:55,898 --> 00:23:58,475
The kids are there inside the bus. 
Be careful.

198
00:24:11,347 --> 00:24:12,547
Ask in the office.

199
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,013
-Come in. 
-Hello.

200
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:18,291
Sit down.

201
00:24:20,103 --> 00:24:21,681
It's our daughter's fifth birthday.

202
00:24:21,917 --> 00:24:24,251
We'd like to celebrate it here.

203
00:24:24,354 --> 00:24:26,315
We want to know about the 
facilities and other details.

204
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:27,964
Okay. I'll show you.

205
00:24:27,989 --> 00:24:29,389
-Raghavan... 
-Yes...

206
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,996
Please show them around.

207
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:34,086
You can go with him.

208
00:24:34,111 --> 00:24:35,111
Okay, thanks.

209
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:36,941
Please come.

210
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:45,415
Who is representing the victim?

211
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:46,282
Sir...

212
00:24:46,345 --> 00:24:47,006
Proceed.

213
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:49,318
Your honour. PW1

214
00:24:49,978 --> 00:24:52,181
She's the mother of the victim.

215
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:54,516
A woman, a wife and a mother.

216
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,397
Last day, she went through a situation 
that shouldn't happen to any woman.

217
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:02,414
Jashik, the accused is 
Amina's second husband.

218
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:05,179
They have been living together 
since their marriage.

219
00:25:05,707 --> 00:25:09,956
When Amina returned home 
from work the other day,

220
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:19,739
she found her 12 year old daughter from her 
first marriage being sexually abused by him.

221
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:21,104
She was shocked.

222
00:25:21,444 --> 00:25:25,059
It's clear that the accused 
who's addicted to cocaine,

223
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:31,891
had the intention to sexually use the 
mother and the child simultaneously.

224
00:25:32,238 --> 00:25:36,004
And the victim is experiencing 
post-traumatic stress disorder.

225
00:25:36,383 --> 00:25:42,988
And the victim's mother, PW1 Amina is still 
in shock wondering what would have happened,

226
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:44,741
if she hadn't reached there on time.

227
00:26:52,557 --> 00:26:53,557
Stop the jeep.

228
00:26:57,089 --> 00:26:58,523
Stop the bus.

229
00:26:59,328 --> 00:27:00,695
Go and get her.

230
00:27:01,438 --> 00:27:02,438
Go.

231
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:07,777
What is your intention?

232
00:27:07,802 --> 00:27:08,583
What?

233
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,380
Just because you work in 
media, you can say anything?

234
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:13,999
If you utter anything about 
our party again, you'll be assaulted.

235
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:15,319
What will you do if I say?

236
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:17,256
What? You want to know?

237
00:27:17,654 --> 00:27:19,574
-Don't touch me. 
-What will you do if I touch.

238
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:20,315
Leave me.

239
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:22,067
What the hell are you doing? 
Take your hands off her.

240
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:23,045
Get lost!

241
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:24,176
Get out!

242
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:26,370
-Get out of the bus. 
-You get lost.

243
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,723
Come here.

244
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,842
-Come here. 
-Leave me.

245
00:27:31,658 --> 00:27:32,704
Come outside.

246
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:35,031
What are you doing?

247
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:36,090
Leave me.

248
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:37,441
Come here.

249
00:27:38,405 --> 00:27:39,269
Leave me.

250
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:40,553
Get inside.

251
00:27:42,972 --> 00:27:43,760
Close it.

252
00:27:43,918 --> 00:27:45,800
Start the vehicle.

253
00:28:52,306 --> 00:28:53,633
Who are you? Why are you here?

254
00:28:57,071 --> 00:28:59,542
As per the poxo 2012 act,

255
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:06,889
I request the court to deny bail for the 
defendant and give him maximum punishment.

256
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:08,408
That is all your honour.

257
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,054
You have anything to say?

258
00:29:16,578 --> 00:29:17,839
No, sir. Not guilty.

259
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,290
Is the information correct?

260
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,494
Don't let him go. I'll 
inform Sreya and come there.

261
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:27,991
Who are you?

262
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:30,912
Looking at your appearance, you 
seem to be from Andra Pradesh.

263
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,766
Do you need transfer? 
Just tell me if you want.

264
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:36,506
I've a strong contact in Vijayawada. 
I can help.

265
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:39,647
Don't be ashamed to ask.

266
00:29:42,926 --> 00:29:44,021
Sreya, where are you?

267
00:29:44,046 --> 00:29:45,319
On my way.

268
00:29:45,515 --> 00:29:46,694
I'll come soon.

269
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:57,744
Satyan...

270
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:12,845
Sir...

271
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,303
The game would change if you touch me.

272
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:18,043
I'm not just a trust manager.

273
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:22,053
I'm friends with even our ministers.

274
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,591
Lenin Idikula won't give you statement.

275
00:30:26,641 --> 00:30:29,125
Just do whatever you can.

276
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,764
Didn't I tell you I don't know anything?

277
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:49,459
What's it? Did he say anything.

278
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:51,833
He's not saying anything. 
Just showing attitude.

279
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:54,386
I'm not going to say anything at all.

280
00:31:12,143 --> 00:31:13,055
So...

281
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:15,605
Lenin Idikula...

282
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,509
Your Vizag contact...

283
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:23,871
Andra Anti traffic unit 
caught him two days back.

284
00:31:24,818 --> 00:31:27,974
It was he who said you'd be here.

285
00:31:31,822 --> 00:31:32,822
So...

286
00:31:33,432 --> 00:31:34,432
Let's start?

287
00:32:01,725 --> 00:32:04,322
Deepan, you come with me. 
Savan, you take him.

288
00:33:26,271 --> 00:33:28,304
-Close the window. 
-What's this?

289
00:33:32,104 --> 00:33:33,182
-Are you okay?

290
00:33:40,671 --> 00:33:41,805
Close the window.

291
00:33:43,766 --> 00:33:44,968
No. Don't jump.

292
00:33:46,289 --> 00:33:47,289
Savan...

293
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:49,442
Sreya, are you okay?

294
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,559
Madam...

295
00:33:52,914 --> 00:33:54,442
Pull her from there.

296
00:33:58,071 --> 00:33:59,071
Lie her down.

297
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:03,911
Guys, careful.

298
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:08,380
Savan, look back.

299
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:09,516
Somebody is there. Go.

300
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,797
Savan, you go. I'll take care of her.

301
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:13,876
Oh God!

302
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:16,118
-Catch him. 
-Stop there.

303
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:18,334
Hey...

304
00:34:18,584 --> 00:34:19,417
Stay there.

305
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,519
"Acid was thrown at Sreya IPS who's investigating 
the sexual allegations against Devanathan Trust."

306
00:34:37,247 --> 00:34:39,730
"Trust manager Lenin Idikula has been killed."

307
00:34:39,895 --> 00:34:41,739
"He was the main man 
behind the sexual abuses."

308
00:34:57,245 --> 00:34:58,245
Dr. Mahadevan.

309
00:34:58,761 --> 00:34:59,761
Have it.

310
00:34:59,954 --> 00:35:00,954
Have it.

311
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,976
To be honest,

312
00:35:05,774 --> 00:35:07,242
I was shocked to hear the news.

313
00:35:07,993 --> 00:35:09,059
What an incident!

314
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:12,247
See, I have been shivering since then.

315
00:35:13,631 --> 00:35:15,747
Just like some English films.

316
00:35:17,954 --> 00:35:23,576
But it's sad that you killed 
poor Idikulla in an encounter.

317
00:35:24,244 --> 00:35:26,250
Many families are depending on him.

318
00:35:26,673 --> 00:35:29,507
Sreedharan sir's daughter's 
career opening is good.

319
00:35:29,655 --> 00:35:30,655
Superb!

320
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:34,235
There wasn't even a 
rehearsal before the stunt.

321
00:35:34,768 --> 00:35:35,768
And...

322
00:35:36,651 --> 00:35:39,557
What if the acid had fallen somewhere else?

323
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:42,613
So don't do risky games.

324
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:43,741
Hey...

325
00:35:52,337 --> 00:35:53,657
-Superb! 
-You wait outside.

326
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:02,249
One thorn of experience is worth 
a whole wilderness of warning.

327
00:36:02,409 --> 00:36:03,809
James Russell Lowell.

328
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:06,361
It was taught by Sreedharan sir.

329
00:36:06,431 --> 00:36:07,375
I haven't forgotten it.

330
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,087
Arun...

331
00:36:15,329 --> 00:36:16,329
Mahi...

332
00:36:17,011 --> 00:36:18,611
I was coming to meet you.

333
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:22,069
The most glorified plastic surgeon.

334
00:36:22,868 --> 00:36:23,868
Dr. Arun!

335
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:25,384
Hey, what's this?

336
00:36:26,113 --> 00:36:27,108
You have a tattoo.

337
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:29,600
"Sudha"... Is it your new girlfriend?

338
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:32,032
Leave it.

339
00:36:32,704 --> 00:36:34,157
How come you're here? Any relatives?

340
00:36:34,712 --> 00:36:36,100
Actually I'd come to meet you.

341
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:38,984
That is when I got to know Sreya 
IPS has met with an accident.

342
00:36:39,402 --> 00:36:41,083
Remember Swetha who had 
studied with us in college?

343
00:36:42,168 --> 00:36:43,441
She's Swetha's sister.

344
00:36:43,638 --> 00:36:44,638
Our Swetha.

345
00:36:45,506 --> 00:36:46,506
Your Swetha.

346
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,053
-Swetha Sreedharan? 
-Yes..

347
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:10,687
Sreya is her sister.

348
00:37:11,197 --> 00:37:13,984
I'd tried to contact you. 
But you were in the USA.

349
00:37:14,453 --> 00:37:16,557
And I got busy.

350
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:18,734
I came to know only recently 
that you got back.

351
00:37:20,477 --> 00:37:22,012
Come. Let's have a coffee.

352
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,133
Come on.

353
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:24,235
I'm on duty.

354
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:26,626
Carry on.

355
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,336
I'll call you. Bye.

356
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:34,605
-Who was that visitor? 
-MLA's son.

357
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:35,819
Okay.

358
00:37:37,459 --> 00:37:38,910
Ma'am, any problem?

359
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:08,970
It's just a first degree burn. 
It's superficial.

360
00:38:10,322 --> 00:38:11,752
You'll be fine within two days.

361
00:38:26,545 --> 00:38:27,956
Ma'am, are you okay?

362
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:33,349
Finally you took out your weapon.

363
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:35,538
You had to see how she beat them up.

364
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,811
I almost lost my consciousness 
seeing her beating a guy.

365
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,829
And another guy's reproductive 
system got smashed.

366
00:38:40,854 --> 00:38:42,120
That is how it was.

367
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:44,999
Don't be Mary Kom for sometime.

368
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:48,663
She is the one who made 
trolls on party people.

369
00:38:49,147 --> 00:38:53,494
And when everything got over, she left 
only after taking a selfie with them.

370
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:55,089
I'll show that.

371
00:38:56,637 --> 00:38:57,637
Here.

372
00:38:57,988 --> 00:38:58,988
See.

373
00:38:59,497 --> 00:39:00,653
-See. 
-Isn't it good?

374
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:02,519
So, have you started online promotion?

375
00:39:02,544 --> 00:39:05,646
No. Anyway, you come after your duty. 
We'll all be there.

376
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:07,338
Let's go.

377
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,228
Thank you.

378
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:21,033
My hand is paining badly. Oh, God!

379
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:31,349
What happened?

380
00:39:37,954 --> 00:39:39,304
I tried calling you.

381
00:39:42,936 --> 00:39:44,695
This needs only two weeks of rest.

382
00:39:47,904 --> 00:39:48,880
Why did you call?

383
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,010
Oh, yes...

384
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,935
I wanted to know about my patient. 
How's Sara?

385
00:39:53,197 --> 00:39:55,564
Debriding session has to be started 
before doing skin grafting.

386
00:39:56,464 --> 00:39:59,565
She got out of that work 
space only two weeks back.

387
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,357
It's natural. A person's biggest 
confidence is their external appearance.

388
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:05,713
She's a strong girl.

389
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:08,230
She'll recover from this trauma 
if you give her support.

390
00:40:39,075 --> 00:40:45,533
"Which melodious agony is sung 
in my ears by the rainbow?"

391
00:40:46,156 --> 00:40:52,613
"Which mind's desire is the 
breeze caressing me?"

392
00:40:53,235 --> 00:41:00,005
"The inked poetry by the eyes and words"

393
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:07,184
"Is there a silent consent 
in those sweet lines?"

394
00:41:08,854 --> 00:41:12,915
"You vanish, the rain falls... 
The desires get chilly..."

395
00:41:13,195 --> 00:41:15,726
"Are the snowflakes in love"

396
00:41:15,922 --> 00:41:19,309
"Someone is filling up 
the lashes with coyness"

397
00:41:19,405 --> 00:41:22,858
"Is it a new emotion"

398
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:43,875
"At the lake where moon swims, 
I saw on the lily flower"

399
00:41:43,984 --> 00:41:50,665
"Seasons of love and your 
gentle smile, my beauty"

400
00:41:50,867 --> 00:41:56,883
"The beautiful twilight and 
the singing wild mynah..."

401
00:41:57,851 --> 00:42:04,061
"Their hearts weaved love 
without anyone knowing"

402
00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:11,509
"The inked poetry by the eyes and words"

403
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:18,244
"Is there a silent consent 
in those sweet lines?"

404
00:42:20,696 --> 00:42:23,951
"You vanish, the rain falls... 
The desires get chilly..."

405
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:27,498
"Are the snowflakes in love"

406
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:31,054
"Someone is filling up 
the lashes with coyness"

407
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:34,393
"Is it a new emotion"

408
00:42:38,135 --> 00:42:40,908
I forgot. Your signature is required.

409
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:42,339
Here.

410
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:45,250
Oh, right hand?

411
00:42:51,663 --> 00:42:52,663
Ambidextrous?

412
00:42:53,223 --> 00:42:54,091
Nice.

413
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:56,545
I used to do it for fun when I was young.

414
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,558
And I got used to it.

415
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:00,296
I...

416
00:43:01,868 --> 00:43:05,547
I've an ambidextrous 
friend...from my childhood.

417
00:43:06,407 --> 00:43:13,210
"Which melodious agony is sung 
in my ears by the rainbow?"

418
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:19,777
"Which mind's desire is the 
breeze caressing me with?"

419
00:43:20,167 --> 00:43:26,893
"The inked poetry by the eyes and words"

420
00:43:27,317 --> 00:43:33,940
"Is there a silent consent 
in those sweet lines?"

421
00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:03,247
Are you staying here for the first time?

422
00:44:03,272 --> 00:44:03,783
Yes.

423
00:44:03,827 --> 00:44:04,827
Oh, nice!

424
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:06,845
We've two options.

425
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:09,322
A standard room or a studio apartment.

426
00:44:09,642 --> 00:44:10,970
-Studio apartment. 
-Okay.

427
00:44:11,053 --> 00:44:15,187
We have a safety button installed 
for your safety in the rooms,

428
00:44:15,338 --> 00:44:17,026
about which my staff will tell you.

429
00:44:18,472 --> 00:44:20,072
So have a pleasant stay.

430
00:44:20,097 --> 00:44:21,097
Thank you.

431
00:44:21,593 --> 00:44:22,593
See you.

432
00:44:23,646 --> 00:44:24,467
Joji, let's start.

433
00:44:24,514 --> 00:44:26,193
I'm standing in front 
of the Police Club now.

434
00:44:26,271 --> 00:44:28,973
It's a special reporting on MLA Vamadevan.

435
00:44:28,998 --> 00:44:30,407
To question him the police...

436
00:44:30,479 --> 00:44:31,479
Hey, come on.

437
00:44:32,619 --> 00:44:35,189
Sir, why were you asked to 
come to the police club?

438
00:44:35,424 --> 00:44:38,314
Is it regarding Idikula's murder 
or the sexual allegations?

439
00:44:38,347 --> 00:44:39,347
Please tell.

440
00:44:39,463 --> 00:44:42,839
Will you deny it if I say the man 
behind the sexual assaults is your son?

441
00:44:43,093 --> 00:44:46,959
Police inquiry is over and I've 
given them honest answers.

442
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:50,263
Let the party decide now. I'll obey them.

443
00:44:54,586 --> 00:44:56,469
He's not well. That's why.

444
00:44:56,774 --> 00:44:58,374
-Let me go. 
-Hey, move.

445
00:45:29,841 --> 00:45:31,263
The last four years of my life.

446
00:45:32,114 --> 00:45:37,652
It was a journey in search of new 
technologies through scary paths.

447
00:45:38,153 --> 00:45:41,082
Maybe it was all for this moment.

448
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:43,574
For this day. Only for this day.

449
00:45:44,935 --> 00:45:46,001
I was in jail...

450
00:45:47,005 --> 00:45:48,005
War zones...

451
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,097
Difficult situations...

452
00:45:52,107 --> 00:45:53,173
Don't use flash.

453
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:00,250
Hey, come.

454
00:46:02,855 --> 00:46:04,388
Sir, we need your help.

455
00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:08,669
People with whom we can never get along.

456
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,528
Their conflicting concepts.

457
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,489
Visionaries with foresight.

458
00:46:14,263 --> 00:46:15,330
Blind believers.

459
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:20,725
It was my experiences with them 
that led me to the decision to...

460
00:46:20,839 --> 00:46:25,835
...build a new technology 
to wipe out fear.

461
00:46:29,164 --> 00:46:32,031
Let's forget the negative things around us.

462
00:46:32,741 --> 00:46:34,541
One such protective sheath...

463
00:46:35,118 --> 00:46:41,133
But in order to build it, a creative and 
an innovative invention is required.

464
00:46:42,546 --> 00:46:49,796
When we have to face such a situation, 
without depending on the police or others,

465
00:46:50,214 --> 00:46:52,878
but something that is 
useful for them also...

466
00:46:53,116 --> 00:46:54,667
Something which is useful for 
everyone in the society.

467
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,596
Be it children, adults or women...

468
00:46:59,171 --> 00:47:02,562
A protective sheath to travel 
with in the society without fear.

469
00:47:03,124 --> 00:47:05,058
An immediate response system.

470
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:06,373
That is SAFE.

471
00:47:08,866 --> 00:47:12,115
Also, we have seen many 
software applications.

472
00:47:12,924 --> 00:47:13,767
But,

473
00:47:13,938 --> 00:47:18,724
SAFE is not an app that was built by some IT 
professionals working from their comfort zones.

474
00:47:19,354 --> 00:47:20,687
SAFE is a community.

475
00:47:21,393 --> 00:47:26,111
From the old moscode to rocket science, 
merging all the communication systems,

476
00:47:26,659 --> 00:47:31,925
Let it be telecommunication, mobile 
technology,radio frequency or satellite...

477
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:39,400
Merging all these, SAFE is a 
technology built with no limitations.

478
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:49,155
The things which were mere 
accessories until now...

479
00:47:49,381 --> 00:47:51,523
Rings, key chains, lockets...

480
00:47:51,737 --> 00:47:58,671
These become a communicative 
device through SAFE's technology.

481
00:47:59,332 --> 00:48:04,318
Nobody will dare to attack 
someone who's a member of SAFE.

482
00:48:04,536 --> 00:48:06,169
They would think twice before doing it.

483
00:48:06,819 --> 00:48:09,201
Because the culprit will 
know the consequences.

484
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:11,470
That is the only intention.

485
00:48:14,315 --> 00:48:21,463
In SAFE there are lawyers, doctors, IT 
professionals, media persons and scientists.

486
00:48:22,126 --> 00:48:25,048
Now, you are also there with us.

487
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:31,413
So, SAFE can be downloaded from...

488
00:48:32,245 --> 00:48:33,245
Okay?

489
00:48:35,671 --> 00:48:36,671
Now!

490
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:08,987
Hey, congrats.

491
00:49:09,135 --> 00:49:10,468
Congrats to you too.

492
00:49:11,409 --> 00:49:13,894
Our celebrations and pizza are over.

493
00:49:14,065 --> 00:49:14,705
Is it over?

494
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:16,586
Attention please.

495
00:49:16,762 --> 00:49:17,762
Hey, thank you.

496
00:49:17,928 --> 00:49:18,928
Everyone...

497
00:49:21,713 --> 00:49:24,846
The balance amount in 
SAFE's bank account is...

498
00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:28,703
...just fourteen thousand two hundred rupees.

499
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:36,146
So it's time we request all our well wishers 
to contribute very generously.

500
00:49:36,778 --> 00:49:38,513
Because we really need it.

501
00:49:39,175 --> 00:49:41,372
We have to meet lots of 
expenses this month.

502
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,374
Does Sreya IPS need fund for her surgery?

503
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,626
No. She has only shallow burns. 
It'll get cured easily.

504
00:50:45,132 --> 00:50:46,132
Forgot.

505
00:50:47,024 --> 00:50:48,024
Here.

506
00:50:49,704 --> 00:50:50,915
Oh, thank you.

507
00:50:51,785 --> 00:50:53,042
Highly appreciate it.

508
00:50:53,238 --> 00:50:54,597
I should be thanking you.

509
00:50:54,659 --> 00:50:56,823
These patients and the hospital 
routine were getting into me.

510
00:50:58,228 --> 00:50:59,963
Thank you for gifting me a good Sunday.

511
00:51:01,055 --> 00:51:02,055
Please smile.

512
00:51:04,617 --> 00:51:05,617
Nice!

513
00:51:07,502 --> 00:51:08,460
Okay then bye.

514
00:51:10,462 --> 00:51:11,462
Look at this.

515
00:51:12,046 --> 00:51:13,046
Isn't it good?

516
00:51:13,071 --> 00:51:14,071
Let me see.

517
00:51:14,295 --> 00:51:15,146
Isn't it nice?

518
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:16,537
Doctor's smile is good.

519
00:51:16,592 --> 00:51:17,686
Should I tell him?

520
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,672
-Give it to her. 
-Oh!

521
00:51:25,147 --> 00:51:27,264
Okay. I'm coming.

522
00:51:27,368 --> 00:51:28,902
Hold this. I'm leaving.

523
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,384
It must be from her office.

524
00:51:30,673 --> 00:51:31,673
What is that?

525
00:51:32,072 --> 00:51:33,544
-What happened? 
-Don't know.

526
00:51:35,151 --> 00:51:36,151
It's from Arun.

527
00:51:39,508 --> 00:51:42,572
"Breaking news... Nadakavu 
MLA Vamadevan passed away"

528
00:51:42,863 --> 00:51:46,042
"His death was due to heart attack"

529
00:51:49,508 --> 00:51:55,404
"MLA Vamadevan's body will be 
brought to his residence shortly"

530
00:51:55,429 --> 00:52:00,508
"The party spokesman informed the body will be kept 
in the town hall for the public to pay respects"

531
00:52:00,899 --> 00:52:03,912
"The Prime Minister expressed 
his heartfelt condolences"

532
00:52:04,111 --> 00:52:10,173
"The Chief Minister said his demise 
is a great loss for Kerala politics"

533
00:52:10,424 --> 00:52:16,935
"Thousands of people are coming 
to pay last respects to him"

534
00:52:17,313 --> 00:52:24,504
"He has served as the health 
minister in 1984, 1996 and 2003"

535
00:52:24,743 --> 00:52:31,618
"He was to become the health minister after 
the upcoming reconstitution of the cabinet"

536
00:52:38,211 --> 00:52:48,016
"Political observers are looking forward to see if his 
demise would pay way for his son's political entry"

537
00:52:49,017 --> 00:52:52,683
Vamadevan was mentally distressed 
for the past few days.

538
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:55,019
"The sexual allegations 
against the Devanathan trust..."

539
00:52:55,151 --> 00:52:57,276
"The trust manager Idikula's murder..."

540
00:52:57,423 --> 00:52:59,766
"The acid attack on Sreya IPS..."

541
00:53:00,036 --> 00:53:04,434
"It was amidst these that he passed away"

542
00:53:04,699 --> 00:53:07,033
"With cameraman Sajeev, Fiona Philip"

543
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:10,903
Party has lost its captain.

544
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:16,932
Along with mourning for him,

545
00:53:17,144 --> 00:53:22,019
let's hope that he helps us to 
find an eligible candidate.

546
00:53:28,242 --> 00:53:30,509
[news regarding Vamadevan's death]

547
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,234
Round them up.

548
00:54:23,977 --> 00:54:24,913
Get them, along.

549
00:54:35,618 --> 00:54:36,618
Let's go.

550
00:54:44,622 --> 00:54:46,497
Conduct discussions for that.

551
00:54:46,826 --> 00:54:47,826
Your names...

552
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,029
I want to say something.

553
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:53,088
Listen...

554
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:56,932
You people are talking as if 
I'm behind my father's death.

555
00:54:59,878 --> 00:55:03,417
It was cooked up by some channel reporter.

556
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:05,658
Party need not go behind it.

557
00:55:06,222 --> 00:55:09,308
In the name of police investigation,

558
00:55:09,816 --> 00:55:13,537
if you are going to do something that 
would destroy my political career...

559
00:55:14,753 --> 00:55:16,823
Not just me, it would affect everyone.

560
00:55:16,902 --> 00:55:17,566
Got it?

561
00:55:17,665 --> 00:55:20,465
Let me make it clear. I deserve that seat.

562
00:55:20,501 --> 00:55:21,501
Health!

563
00:55:22,212 --> 00:55:23,556
And I'm qualified for that.

564
00:55:24,117 --> 00:55:27,516
Son, why do you have to get angry?

565
00:55:28,223 --> 00:55:31,019
Party is yet to make a decision.

566
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:32,145
Isn't it?

567
00:55:32,612 --> 00:55:35,711
Try to cool off the media, not our party.

568
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,656
The ones making false accusations 
against you are outside the party.

569
00:55:39,955 --> 00:55:42,845
The opposition party, police and media.

570
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:45,119
Son, handle them. Isn't it?

571
00:55:45,316 --> 00:55:47,753
President, you just take care 
of the people in the party.

572
00:55:48,293 --> 00:55:50,371
I know very well to 
handle the ones outside.

573
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:57,419
And don't do this backstage drama to 
increase your followers on social media.

574
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:58,925
Consider this as a warning.

575
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:08,899
Will you stand in the next by-election?

576
00:56:09,754 --> 00:56:13,223
Will you deny it if we say you are behind 
the sexual abuses and your father's death?

577
00:56:13,374 --> 00:56:16,304
Will you deny it if I say there is something 
suspicious behind Vamadevan's death?

578
00:56:21,863 --> 00:56:23,984
There is a difference between 
old school and new school.

579
00:56:24,374 --> 00:56:26,608
It's made up by people like that. 
It's natural.

580
00:56:26,998 --> 00:56:30,220
And if the party says, I'll 
participate in the by-election.

581
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:31,694
I've agreed to it.

582
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:36,149
I've got only one thing to tell to those saying there 
is something suspicious about my father's death.

583
00:56:36,779 --> 00:56:39,091
Don't waste your time on baseless stories.

584
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:41,577
Let's work for our state.

585
00:56:41,781 --> 00:56:43,914
Let's develop our state. 
That's what is needed, right?

586
00:56:48,082 --> 00:56:49,282
Fiona, one minute.

587
00:56:53,321 --> 00:56:57,281
You ought to be a little more careful 
when you follow up political stories.

588
00:56:57,969 --> 00:56:59,303
It's required, Fiona.

589
00:56:59,922 --> 00:57:00,922
Be careful.

590
00:57:01,891 --> 00:57:03,586
Your friends might not 
be there all the time.

591
00:57:04,586 --> 00:57:05,920
Hope you understand.

592
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,985
Did you understand what I said?

593
00:57:16,731 --> 00:57:18,793
Is this the man who assigned you the work?

594
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:25,680
Haven't you completed the formalities?

595
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:26,860
Yes, sir.

596
00:57:36,293 --> 00:57:37,560
Okay. You proceed.

597
00:57:43,047 --> 00:57:44,047
Take this.

598
00:58:05,954 --> 00:58:07,088
Vani, look there.

599
00:58:09,284 --> 00:58:10,635
Deepan, go up.

600
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:14,339
Savan, check out that place.

601
00:58:22,203 --> 00:58:23,337
Nothing is there.

602
00:58:24,107 --> 00:58:25,773
There isn't anyone there.

603
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:27,310
What is this?

604
00:58:27,583 --> 00:58:28,778
-CCTV? 
-Yes.

605
00:58:30,203 --> 00:58:31,203
Check it.

606
00:58:35,321 --> 00:58:36,321
Check inside.

607
00:59:00,101 --> 00:59:01,124
There is no one here.

608
00:59:06,391 --> 00:59:07,391
Not available.

609
00:59:09,651 --> 00:59:10,717
We've a problem.

610
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:12,453
I don't think we'd get anything from it.

611
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:15,822
I think it's hacked since 
the last 10 hours.

612
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:37,453
That security camera...

613
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:39,408
Bring it.

614
00:59:53,206 --> 00:59:55,684
Brighten than shot and search 
for more facial details.

615
01:00:03,973 --> 01:00:05,439
Zoom it a little more.

616
01:00:10,017 --> 01:00:11,017
That hoodie...

617
01:00:13,365 --> 01:00:15,132
Can you freeze it?

618
01:00:22,541 --> 01:00:24,259
Aunt, come fast.

619
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:27,656
Are you okay?

620
01:00:27,727 --> 01:00:28,727
I...

621
01:00:29,869 --> 01:00:32,244
I want to know what 
happened to my daughter.

622
01:00:52,934 --> 01:00:55,363
"Mahadevan's disappearance case 
has taken a new lead"

623
01:00:55,388 --> 01:01:00,425
"Police got the CCTV visuals of 
a group kidnapping Mahadevan"

624
01:01:00,450 --> 01:01:02,895
"CCTV visuals are pointing towards Shweta"

625
01:01:03,005 --> 01:01:05,247
"Has he been kidnapped or is it a murder?"

626
01:01:06,573 --> 01:01:07,573
Thank you, sir.

627
01:01:10,422 --> 01:01:14,934
Does Sweta have any role in 
Mahadevan's disappearance?

628
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:15,833
No comments.

629
01:01:15,928 --> 01:01:19,342
Do you think this suspension 
is a political vengeance?

630
01:01:19,605 --> 01:01:22,511
Will the missing case of 
your sister be reopened?

631
01:01:23,193 --> 01:01:26,575
"Is Mahadevan's disappearance just 
the opposition party's allegation?"

632
01:01:46,815 --> 01:01:48,465
I'm leaving. Bye.

633
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:33,870
"As these sunny paths are 
withdrawing, return to give me a hand"

634
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:44,833
"As drops of tears fall on the cheeks, 
return to bring back the smile"

635
01:02:46,049 --> 01:02:55,895
"Day and night came regularly 
narrating many tales"

636
01:02:56,715 --> 01:03:02,199
"Fun and laughter died away"

637
01:03:02,512 --> 01:03:06,645
"One day...many days...I'm all alone"

638
01:03:50,010 --> 01:03:59,877
"When darkness covers the 
sky, I'm the only star left"

639
01:04:00,649 --> 01:04:10,893
"The moment when your mind which 
was there day and night left"

640
01:04:11,468 --> 01:04:15,640
"If you are coming back..."

641
01:04:16,094 --> 01:04:21,165
"We can complete the unfinished story"

642
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:30,663
"All that fills up the mind can 
be shared as inner warmth"

643
01:04:32,772 --> 01:04:42,677
"As these sunny paths are withdrawing, 
return to give me a hand"

644
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:53,164
"As drops of tears fall on the cheeks, 
return to bring back the smile"

645
01:04:54,193 --> 01:05:03,787
"Day and night came regularly 
narrating many tales"

646
01:05:04,827 --> 01:05:09,913
"Fun and laughter died away"

647
01:05:10,147 --> 01:05:15,915
"One day...many days...I'm all alone"

648
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,086
"All alone..."

649
01:05:45,058 --> 01:05:47,510
Why isn't she home yet?

650
01:06:04,257 --> 01:06:05,818
She might have gone to Sreeja's.

651
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,212
-Is this Sreeja's house? 
-Yes.

652
01:06:22,433 --> 01:06:24,276
I'm Swetha's father.

653
01:06:24,528 --> 01:06:25,449
Tell me.

654
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:28,840
Swetha hasn't reached home yet.

655
01:06:29,481 --> 01:06:31,395
Sreeja is home. Should I call her?

656
01:06:31,598 --> 01:06:34,824
No. Do you have the number 
of any other friends?

657
01:06:34,909 --> 01:06:38,174
Try calling Akshara. 
She might be there with her.

658
01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:39,378
Okay.

659
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,863
-Dear... 
-Yes?

660
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:47,690
Bring me your sister's college diary.

661
01:06:47,794 --> 01:06:48,860
I'll get it now.

662
01:06:56,475 --> 01:06:57,475
Here.

663
01:07:18,005 --> 01:07:19,224
She's not picking up the phone.

664
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:23,740
Come here.

665
01:07:32,342 --> 01:07:33,608
-Sharadha... 
-Yes?

666
01:07:33,952 --> 01:07:35,085
Please come here.

667
01:07:36,561 --> 01:07:39,084
Dear, get the bike key.

668
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:47,223
Brother, where are you going?

669
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:48,930
Swetha is not back yet.

670
01:07:49,077 --> 01:07:51,477
Let me go to the bus stop and check.

671
01:07:51,538 --> 01:07:53,538
You be here. 
Give me the key.

672
01:07:55,218 --> 01:07:57,046
-You stay here. 
-I'm also going with him.

673
01:07:58,093 --> 01:07:59,093
Oh God!

674
01:08:25,329 --> 01:08:27,984
Where are you both off to at night?

675
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:29,437
Is there any problem?

676
01:08:29,613 --> 01:08:30,613
No.

677
01:08:31,027 --> 01:08:33,427
Swetha is not back from the college.

678
01:08:34,089 --> 01:08:35,889
The way home is pitch dark.

679
01:08:37,891 --> 01:08:39,274
It's 9.30 pm.

680
01:08:40,672 --> 01:08:42,711
Sir, the last bus has gone.

681
01:08:43,084 --> 01:08:44,271
Is it?

682
01:08:44,774 --> 01:08:45,896
It's been 10 minutes.

683
01:08:47,776 --> 01:08:50,042
Let me go to the college and check.

684
01:08:50,183 --> 01:08:51,557
-That's better. 
-Come dear.

685
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:54,375
Hold this.

686
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,060
Let's go.

687
01:09:00,138 --> 01:09:01,138
See you.

688
01:09:04,565 --> 01:09:06,478
Isn't that Sreedharan sir?

689
01:09:06,588 --> 01:09:07,588
Yes.

690
01:09:08,104 --> 01:09:09,171
He is alone now.

691
01:09:10,112 --> 01:09:11,314
He has two daughters.

692
01:09:11,471 --> 01:09:12,495
What about their mother?

693
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:14,181
She died long back.

694
01:09:14,994 --> 01:09:15,994
At a young age.

695
01:09:16,216 --> 01:09:19,099
He's living for his daughters now.

696
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,567
If something happens to them, 
I can't imagine his situation.

697
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:24,078
My God!

698
01:09:24,102 --> 01:09:25,195
Nothing will happen.

699
01:09:25,391 --> 01:09:26,658
It's going to rain.

700
01:09:27,188 --> 01:09:28,188
Let's go.

701
01:09:38,345 --> 01:09:39,345
Who are you?

702
01:09:39,567 --> 01:09:41,739
My daughter is not 
back from college yet.

703
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:43,497
She is not there at her 
friend's house also.

704
01:09:43,988 --> 01:09:45,082
Is she there inside?

705
01:09:45,491 --> 01:09:46,371
There is no one inside.

706
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:48,680
It was after everyone left 
that I closed the gate.

707
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:51,601
Where will I go and search for my daughter?

708
01:09:55,589 --> 01:09:56,923
Will she be there...

709
01:09:57,214 --> 01:09:58,379
Sir, don't become nervous.

710
01:09:58,418 --> 01:09:59,801
She must have got back home.

711
01:10:00,376 --> 01:10:02,066
Don't stay out with her at night.

712
01:10:02,317 --> 01:10:03,650
Sir, please go home.

713
01:10:04,723 --> 01:10:05,934
Where is she...

714
01:10:41,569 --> 01:10:42,569
What happened?

715
01:10:45,647 --> 01:10:47,037
Did you search everywhere?

716
01:10:47,530 --> 01:10:48,874
Did you go to her college?

717
01:10:59,368 --> 01:11:01,797
I'll come tomorrow. 
My kids are alone at home.

718
01:11:02,771 --> 01:11:04,685
You'll be here, right? I'll call you.

719
01:11:04,748 --> 01:11:05,748
Okay.

720
01:11:12,756 --> 01:11:14,090
What will we do now?

721
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:15,483
I don't know.

722
01:11:18,147 --> 01:11:19,452
Shall we inform the police?

723
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:53,349
I want to ask you something.

724
01:12:54,726 --> 01:12:57,031
Did Shweta come for your father's funeral?

725
01:13:15,617 --> 01:13:16,617
I'm confused.

726
01:13:19,605 --> 01:13:22,419
Shweta's come back and Mahadevan's kidnap...

727
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,770
I doubt if she's back to 
settle the old scores.

728
01:13:26,796 --> 01:13:28,543
They used to be headstrong 
rivals at college.

729
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:36,833
Go man!

730
01:13:37,502 --> 01:13:38,864
Dude, just go.

731
01:13:39,925 --> 01:13:40,925
Just go.

732
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:55,557
Both of them were very much obstinate.

733
01:13:55,698 --> 01:13:56,698
Dear...

734
01:13:57,689 --> 01:13:59,289
Here. Shall I bring tea?

735
01:13:59,525 --> 01:14:00,859
We will come inside.

736
01:14:12,493 --> 01:14:13,594
What is the matter?

737
01:14:13,735 --> 01:14:14,735
Any problem?

738
01:14:24,187 --> 01:14:25,625
Hey, it's from SAFE.

739
01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:27,810
Deepan, I'll forward a message.

740
01:14:28,419 --> 01:14:30,505
Do a follow up and let me 
know if you need any back up.

741
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:41,001
It's from SAFE.

742
01:14:42,516 --> 01:14:44,351
It's Arundati Das's dream project.

743
01:14:45,165 --> 01:14:47,524
Their application is live now. 
I'm really happy for her.

744
01:14:48,671 --> 01:14:49,671
Arundati Das?

745
01:14:50,194 --> 01:14:50,928
The social activist?

746
01:14:52,171 --> 01:14:53,237
Do you know her?

747
01:14:53,428 --> 01:14:54,686
Yes. Very well.

748
01:14:55,068 --> 01:15:00,957
In the last 3 years, I've done around 20 
plastic surgeries for acid attack victims.

749
01:15:01,442 --> 01:15:02,723
She is a true humanitarian.

750
01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:08,205
She is the head of a big organization 
that arranges even advanced surgeries.

751
01:15:12,171 --> 01:15:13,514
Where do they get the funds for this?

752
01:15:13,936 --> 01:15:14,889
What is their source?

753
01:15:15,611 --> 01:15:17,994
Public donations, CSR and...

754
01:15:19,564 --> 01:15:20,533
Inquisitiveness of a police?

755
01:15:20,596 --> 01:15:22,129
Hey, nothing like that.

756
01:15:22,509 --> 01:15:23,709
Where is she from?

757
01:15:23,992 --> 01:15:25,259
She is from Kannur.

758
01:15:25,633 --> 01:15:27,758
You can get the permanent 
address from some files.

759
01:15:28,672 --> 01:15:29,672
But why?

760
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:31,279
Just curious.

761
01:15:31,427 --> 01:15:33,248
I don't have anything 
much to do now, right?

762
01:15:34,826 --> 01:15:35,982
Tea would become cold. Please come.

763
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:38,978
I might need a back up.

764
01:15:55,966 --> 01:15:57,552
-There is something fishy there. 
-What happened?

765
01:15:57,654 --> 01:15:59,296
Some illegal activity is going on there.

766
01:15:59,687 --> 01:16:01,571
You and four others lock the back entrance.

767
01:16:02,016 --> 01:16:03,524
-Others come with me. 
-Sir, your revolver.

768
01:16:03,532 --> 01:16:04,865
Everyone be careful.

769
01:16:15,233 --> 01:16:16,233
Upstairs?

770
01:16:35,276 --> 01:16:36,276
Oh crap!

771
01:16:41,902 --> 01:16:42,902
Go down. Fast.

772
01:17:17,158 --> 01:17:18,431
Yes. We did it.

773
01:17:23,530 --> 01:17:24,530
Sradha, what is going on?

774
01:17:24,546 --> 01:17:26,746
The police is here with the ambulance.

775
01:17:27,803 --> 01:17:28,803
We are leaving.

776
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:31,607
-Everything is alright here. 
-That one...

777
01:17:34,757 --> 01:17:36,303
It was Sradha. They are safe.

778
01:17:36,802 --> 01:17:37,802
Come.

779
01:17:50,672 --> 01:17:52,338
-Over there. 
-Come here.

780
01:17:54,929 --> 01:17:57,515
Sir, who's behind it?

781
01:17:57,642 --> 01:18:01,571
The raid was based on the information 
we received from a private app.

782
01:18:01,805 --> 01:18:04,005
We have saved almost 20 children.

783
01:18:04,165 --> 01:18:05,493
I can't reveal anything more.

784
01:18:09,053 --> 01:18:10,586
Please. No photographs.

785
01:18:10,939 --> 01:18:12,689
Please listen. No photographs.

786
01:18:13,377 --> 01:18:15,470
Get them inside.

787
01:18:15,517 --> 01:18:16,517
Speed up.

788
01:18:17,947 --> 01:18:19,997
Start the vehicle.

789
01:18:20,372 --> 01:18:22,809
Get going. 
Vani, come on.

790
01:18:23,216 --> 01:18:24,749
Excuse me. Please move.

791
01:18:29,315 --> 01:18:30,069
You move. 
I'll join you.

792
01:18:30,364 --> 01:18:31,364
Let's move.

793
01:18:37,684 --> 01:18:41,636
Mahadevan's disappearance is a conspiracy 
by the police and the opposition party.

794
01:18:41,738 --> 01:18:45,276
Their intention is to 
destroy our party's image.

795
01:18:45,691 --> 01:18:48,036
We'll take strong actions against it.

796
01:18:48,979 --> 01:18:52,635
"This search and rescue operation will 
be Kerala police's biggest achievement"

797
01:18:52,791 --> 01:18:56,573
"The raid was based on the information 
we received from a private app"

798
01:18:56,959 --> 01:18:59,159
"We have saved almost 20 children"

799
01:18:59,310 --> 01:19:00,677
"I can't reveal anything more"

800
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:06,426
Doctor, please get that first aid box.

801
01:19:06,551 --> 01:19:07,551
What happened?

802
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:09,090
Nothing.

803
01:19:10,881 --> 01:19:12,115
Hey, it's nothing.

804
01:19:14,313 --> 01:19:15,537
Just a small scratch.

805
01:19:15,561 --> 01:19:16,693
Sradha, sit there.

806
01:19:19,981 --> 01:19:20,981
Please take.

807
01:19:21,795 --> 01:19:23,329
-Good job. 
-Thank you.

808
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:27,127
Listen.

809
01:19:27,376 --> 01:19:28,976
This is just a beginning.

810
01:19:29,103 --> 01:19:31,564
Tomorrow is an important day for all of us.

811
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:36,611
If our software testing should happen without 
any issues, we must work in complete sync.

812
01:19:55,819 --> 01:19:57,203
Police should maintain justice.

813
01:19:58,929 --> 01:20:00,741
Stop the hooliganism of police.

814
01:20:03,016 --> 01:20:04,656
IDF Zindabad.

815
01:20:06,665 --> 01:20:13,172
"It's the news cooked up by the politicians, who 
envy the growth of the righteous leader Mahadevan

816
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:15,032
the media are celebrating"

817
01:20:15,427 --> 01:20:17,427
"What mistake did Mahadevan do?"

818
01:20:17,834 --> 01:20:21,451
"Then why is there a 
warrant to arrest him?"

819
01:20:21,725 --> 01:20:23,498
"That is the favoritism of media"

820
01:20:23,717 --> 01:20:28,037
"Ask Sreya IPS who is behind all these lies. 
Let her answer"

821
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:30,285
"It's not a media favoritism sir..."

822
01:20:30,658 --> 01:20:32,801
Police should maintain justice.

823
01:20:35,862 --> 01:20:37,471
Stop the hooliganism of police.

824
01:20:43,676 --> 01:20:44,676
I'll....

825
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:45,974
No.

826
01:20:48,569 --> 01:20:50,409
What did you say in front of them?

827
01:20:50,822 --> 01:20:51,822
What?

828
01:20:52,654 --> 01:20:53,493
Look at me.

829
01:20:53,572 --> 01:20:56,316
So you'd belittle me in 
front of others, right?

830
01:20:56,836 --> 01:20:57,343
You...

831
01:21:00,734 --> 01:21:03,022
Rock...Paper...Scissors...

832
01:21:11,075 --> 01:21:13,013
-Which room? 
-Room no 4.

833
01:21:13,232 --> 01:21:14,632
Abhishekh, come fast.

834
01:21:15,365 --> 01:21:17,174
Sara, just take care of my daughter.

835
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:23,698
-What are you looking at? 
-Leave me.

836
01:21:23,723 --> 01:21:24,519
Shut up!

837
01:21:25,691 --> 01:21:26,691
Open the door.

838
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:30,451
Hey, open the door.

839
01:21:40,443 --> 01:21:42,363
Who are you? 
What is the matter?

840
01:21:43,620 --> 01:21:44,620
Move back.

841
01:22:06,536 --> 01:22:08,629
"Police should maintain justice"

842
01:22:08,739 --> 01:22:11,687
IDF Zindabad!

843
01:22:14,552 --> 01:22:16,715
It's just a political vendetta.

844
01:22:17,036 --> 01:22:20,973
A dynamic leader like Mahadevan 
is tomorrowâ€™s promise.

845
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:24,480
This is just a farce by the opposition 
party to win the by-election.

846
01:22:24,628 --> 01:22:26,854
I don't understand why 
you are supporting it.

847
01:22:29,839 --> 01:22:32,081
"I'm the one who murdered Lenin Idikula"

848
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:39,536
"Because he has tortured many girls 
by presenting them to VIP's"

849
01:22:40,249 --> 01:22:43,311
"So, I'd to kill him. 
He was a cancer"

850
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:45,667
"He was a cancer"

851
01:22:46,738 --> 01:22:48,818
"So, I just removed it"

852
01:22:52,478 --> 01:22:53,954
Sir, please watch this video.

853
01:22:53,994 --> 01:22:54,994
What is this?

854
01:22:55,207 --> 01:22:58,386
I'm the one who murdered Lenin Idikula.

855
01:22:59,678 --> 01:23:01,100
This is a manipulated video.

856
01:23:01,459 --> 01:23:05,041
You are fooling the people by 
using Mahadevan's morphed video.

857
01:23:05,427 --> 01:23:08,200
Party has doubts regarding 
the authenticity of this video.

858
01:23:08,474 --> 01:23:11,318
I won't believe this. 
I understood your attitude.

859
01:23:11,474 --> 01:23:12,560
This much is enough.

860
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:14,153
Sir, few more questions are there.

861
01:23:14,246 --> 01:23:16,152
Don't make me throw you out of the house.

862
01:23:16,464 --> 01:23:17,064
That is all.

863
01:23:34,545 --> 01:23:35,717
-You want tea? 
-Okay.

864
01:23:37,327 --> 01:23:38,460
Brother, one tea.

865
01:23:40,288 --> 01:23:42,960
That distress message...

866
01:23:43,251 --> 01:23:45,492
It was first received in SAFE's server.

867
01:23:45,735 --> 01:23:48,922
It was rerouted from there 
in the form of message.

868
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:55,064
But I got the message several hours after 
the distress signal was generated.

869
01:23:55,271 --> 01:23:57,538
And before you people got there...

870
01:23:58,865 --> 01:24:00,274
...the culprits were outnumbered.

871
01:24:04,474 --> 01:24:05,705
So, this Kannur trip?

872
01:24:07,158 --> 01:24:08,291
Just an intuition.

873
01:24:09,689 --> 01:24:10,822
If it's correct,

874
01:24:12,062 --> 01:24:14,682
then we are on the right path.

875
01:24:16,395 --> 01:24:17,395
If not...

876
01:24:18,222 --> 01:24:19,745
A long bike ride.

877
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,020
Which I deserve. That is all.

878
01:24:22,486 --> 01:24:24,400
I'll message you the Kannur address.

879
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:29,288
Doesn't this place remind 
you of our Dehradun campus?

880
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,695
-Tea was superb. 
-Thank you.

881
01:24:32,093 --> 01:24:33,893
-How much? 
-Thirty rupees.

882
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,414
Okay, take care.

883
01:24:47,263 --> 01:24:48,575
Drop me off in the town.

884
01:24:52,045 --> 01:24:54,061
"Mahadevan is on the news once again"

885
01:24:54,327 --> 01:24:57,522
"His second confession 
video is also out now"

886
01:24:57,677 --> 01:24:59,794
I'll give you five crore immediately.

887
01:24:59,934 --> 01:25:02,208
Go to Devanathan trust and meet Ms. Nirmala.

888
01:25:02,476 --> 01:25:05,412
Tell her you need two 'Ping box'. 
You'll get the money.

889
01:25:05,775 --> 01:25:10,724
"Illegal money and documents were found in 
the income tax raid at Devanathan Trust"

890
01:25:11,768 --> 01:25:15,002
The opposition party is taking 
revenge on us through this.

891
01:25:15,427 --> 01:25:18,406
Or else how is it possible to show the video 
of a dead person confessing everything.

892
01:25:18,521 --> 01:25:19,759
Advanced technology. That is all.

893
01:25:19,783 --> 01:25:22,150
So are you saying Mahadevan is not alive?

894
01:25:22,252 --> 01:25:23,540
I didn't say so.

895
01:25:23,697 --> 01:25:28,806
And even if he's dead, he's only responsible 
for the murder and the sexual allegations.

896
01:25:28,970 --> 01:25:31,478
Our party has no role in it. 
That is all.

897
01:25:31,509 --> 01:25:33,702
Sir, one more question.

898
01:25:34,871 --> 01:25:36,138
Eshwar Das's house?

899
01:25:36,526 --> 01:25:38,259
Go straight and take a left.

900
01:25:39,657 --> 01:25:40,657
Okay.

901
01:26:05,789 --> 01:26:08,321
This is good for pickling.

902
01:26:09,423 --> 01:26:10,423
Eshwari Amma?

903
01:26:12,061 --> 01:26:14,413
Yes. What's it? 
Who are you?

904
01:26:15,859 --> 01:26:16,859
Mr. Das?

905
01:26:19,465 --> 01:26:21,399
Who are you? Do you know Das?

906
01:26:22,113 --> 01:26:24,683
No. I just dropped by to meet you.

907
01:26:24,957 --> 01:26:29,363
I know you. Don't you act in television 
serials as a police officer?

908
01:26:29,445 --> 01:26:30,445
It's superb.

909
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:31,685
Sit down.

910
01:26:35,898 --> 01:26:37,265
Doesn't Mr. Das come here?

911
01:26:38,136 --> 01:26:40,403
What about his daughter Arundathi?

912
01:26:40,988 --> 01:26:42,522
Das comes occasionally.

913
01:26:44,333 --> 01:26:45,797
I've met his daughter when she was young.

914
01:26:45,984 --> 01:26:47,921
They all are in Delhi.

915
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,843
They had come here once.

916
01:26:50,569 --> 01:26:53,381
I asked him to leave her here.

917
01:26:54,411 --> 01:26:55,700
But he didn't listen.

918
01:26:55,774 --> 01:26:58,031
He is her only brother.

919
01:26:58,310 --> 01:26:59,510
He was in the army.

920
01:27:00,436 --> 01:27:04,139
He is younger than me by 10 years.

921
01:27:05,173 --> 01:27:08,180
He fell in love with a girl 
from another caste.

922
01:27:08,613 --> 01:27:11,213
Everyone was against it.

923
01:27:11,683 --> 01:27:13,737
He's an obstinate guy.

924
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:17,628
He went off to Delhi with her. 
They have a daughter.

925
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:22,103
She is given my mother's name- Arundathi.

926
01:27:23,779 --> 01:27:27,099
She has my mother's hazel eyes.

927
01:27:28,022 --> 01:27:30,125
Does Arundathi come here?

928
01:27:31,537 --> 01:27:32,537
Not at all.

929
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:38,716
Wasn't she brought up in Delhi? 
How will she like our land?

930
01:27:38,963 --> 01:27:41,431
It's been years since Das came.

931
01:27:43,399 --> 01:27:45,993
He calls me at times. 
That's all.

932
01:28:07,747 --> 01:28:09,080
-Faiza madam? 
-Yes.

933
01:30:00,565 --> 01:30:03,098
A distress message from Faiza's phone.

934
01:30:09,353 --> 01:30:10,553
It's switched off!

935
01:30:16,938 --> 01:30:18,871
-Hello Abhishekh?  
-Yes Fiona.

936
01:30:18,975 --> 01:30:20,600
A distress message from Faiza's phone.

937
01:30:21,069 --> 01:30:22,069
What happened?

938
01:30:22,731 --> 01:30:24,191
Yes, I've my phone with me.

939
01:30:24,216 --> 01:30:25,482
Wait. Let me check.

940
01:30:26,019 --> 01:30:27,847
Sara, get up. 
Switch on the monitor.

941
01:30:28,279 --> 01:30:29,279
Switch it on.

942
01:30:47,415 --> 01:30:49,690
You're listening to WDA 95.3 FM

943
01:30:49,761 --> 01:30:52,604
I'm sorry to interrupt. 
I need a help.

944
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:57,091
My friend who's from Madurai 
is new to this city.

945
01:30:57,289 --> 01:31:01,423
She's completely new to this city and 
doesn't know the routes over here.

946
01:31:01,449 --> 01:31:03,449
She got into a cab from her office.

947
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:07,954
I got to know the car has taken a left 
from Edachira instead of going straight.

948
01:31:08,117 --> 01:31:10,164
I'm concerned since it's a dead end.

949
01:31:10,197 --> 01:31:12,963
If anyone from that area 
is listening to me,

950
01:31:13,105 --> 01:31:15,799
please help the driver 
with the correct route.

951
01:31:15,981 --> 01:31:18,827
This is RJ Abhishekh on WDA 95.3

952
01:31:34,963 --> 01:31:36,080
What is it, brother?

953
01:31:36,213 --> 01:31:37,628
Why is your phone switched off?

954
01:31:38,026 --> 01:31:39,151
What if you get lost?

955
01:31:39,176 --> 01:31:40,443
The battery went dead.

956
01:31:41,002 --> 01:31:43,611
This road ends at a river.

957
01:31:45,014 --> 01:31:47,014
Don't make people talk.

958
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:48,225
Isn't she from another state?

959
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:51,461
Don't we have the responsibility 
to take them home safely?

960
01:31:52,412 --> 01:31:53,412
Yes.

961
01:31:54,913 --> 01:31:55,835
Are you from Madurai?

962
01:31:56,559 --> 01:31:57,559
Yes.

963
01:32:04,874 --> 01:32:08,436
When you get into the taxi, you 
should check for the child lock.

964
01:32:08,593 --> 01:32:09,660
Thank you uncle.

965
01:32:10,054 --> 01:32:11,139
These girls!

966
01:32:13,005 --> 01:32:17,661
Listen to some songs and 
take her home safely.

967
01:32:17,903 --> 01:32:18,903
Okay.

968
01:32:18,964 --> 01:32:21,634
Isn't it she from another state? 
Go fast.

969
01:32:21,864 --> 01:32:22,864
Okay.

970
01:32:34,473 --> 01:32:39,288
It's Bombay, Delhi and Calcutta that come to 
my mind when we say 'a city that never sleeps'

971
01:32:39,313 --> 01:32:40,906
But I'm so glad.

972
01:32:41,110 --> 01:32:44,304
When I asked for a small help, 
lots of people called me.

973
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:51,779
I'm so happy to know that many people are 
working at night and listening to my show.

974
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:54,951
The driver was found and he was 
given the correct route also.

975
01:32:54,976 --> 01:32:58,898
The coming track is for all 
those friends who helped.

976
01:33:09,797 --> 01:33:11,428
The train is full. 
There is no chance.

977
01:33:14,164 --> 01:33:16,641
Sir, my berth is not confirmed.

978
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:19,325
It's a little difficult. 
Let me see.

979
01:33:22,193 --> 01:33:24,615
Do one thing. Go to B3 coach.

980
01:34:57,884 --> 01:34:58,662
Where is the alert from?

981
01:34:58,819 --> 01:35:00,277
A train towards Ernakulam.

982
01:35:00,372 --> 01:35:01,372
Kranthiveer.

983
01:35:02,922 --> 01:35:05,574
The station is 32 minutes away and nonstop.

984
01:35:07,771 --> 01:35:08,771
Where is Faiza?

985
01:35:08,802 --> 01:35:11,135
Her mobile is off, but she is safe.

986
01:35:48,434 --> 01:35:49,633
Faiza, come.

987
01:35:51,907 --> 01:35:52,907
Sit down.

988
01:35:59,187 --> 01:36:00,757
Faiza, are you okay?

989
01:36:02,993 --> 01:36:04,306
See, this is the situation.

990
01:36:04,874 --> 01:36:06,941
Can you help that girl somehow?

991
01:36:18,387 --> 01:36:22,397
If it's third or fourth degree burns, 
we'll be going for splits and grafting.

992
01:36:22,522 --> 01:36:23,460
That will be the ideal one.

993
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,758
Derins, please complete it. 
Sorry guys, I've an emergency.

994
01:36:33,741 --> 01:36:35,208
-Can I take your car? 
-Yes, sure.

995
01:36:36,702 --> 01:36:40,049
Right now the train is in Divine 
Nagar, 15 minutes away from Angamaly.

996
01:36:40,351 --> 01:36:42,151
-Then... 
-Wait. The tower?

997
01:36:42,671 --> 01:36:44,278
She needs the tower number. 
Not the station.

998
01:36:44,435 --> 01:36:45,435
Okay.

999
01:36:48,271 --> 01:36:49,604
-Which one? 
-See...

1000
01:36:50,264 --> 01:36:51,530
-That one, right? 
-Yes.

1001
01:36:53,021 --> 01:36:54,646
You make a list.

1002
01:36:55,492 --> 01:36:57,492
I'll read it out. You make the list.

1003
01:36:57,960 --> 01:36:59,477
Take the information of all those towers.

1004
01:37:03,053 --> 01:37:04,561
Stop it.

1005
01:37:05,273 --> 01:37:06,897
Move it towards the side.

1006
01:37:08,077 --> 01:37:09,077
Move it.

1007
01:37:11,562 --> 01:37:13,609
Show me your license.

1008
01:37:14,359 --> 01:37:15,180
Please sir.

1009
01:37:15,344 --> 01:37:18,068
Don't say any excuse. 
Show the original license and go.

1010
01:37:18,093 --> 01:37:19,546
Sir, please try to understand. 
It's an emergency.

1011
01:37:19,725 --> 01:37:21,443
I know your intentions.

1012
01:37:21,904 --> 01:37:23,512
You can go after showing 
your original license.

1013
01:37:27,873 --> 01:37:29,380
Sir, it's an emergency.

1014
01:37:30,037 --> 01:37:31,271
Who are you? Spider man?

1015
01:37:31,334 --> 01:37:32,334
Who are you?

1016
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:33,670
Is it a helmet?

1017
01:37:34,107 --> 01:37:35,574
Sir, please let us go.

1018
01:37:36,785 --> 01:37:39,550
This is a tactical helmet.

1019
01:37:42,395 --> 01:37:44,569
Sir, shall I go? My dear sir.

1020
01:37:46,139 --> 01:37:47,739
Ijaz and Sradha, come...

1021
01:37:47,786 --> 01:37:48,826
Rijo, come on.

1022
01:37:49,038 --> 01:37:50,873
Guys, didn't I also come with you?

1023
01:37:51,804 --> 01:37:53,390
Ijaz, I'm also coming.

1024
01:37:54,186 --> 01:37:55,186
Sir, please.

1025
01:37:55,647 --> 01:37:58,756
Hey, please take me also. 
Don't go.

1026
01:38:10,899 --> 01:38:14,507
Series code is 404-1892

1027
01:38:14,569 --> 01:38:18,600

Don't be nervous.

1034
01:38:42,652 --> 01:38:44,720
-Can I have some water? 
-Bring her water.

1035
01:39:08,069 --> 01:39:10,962
"You're under the surveillance of Kerala Police. 
If you misbehave, you'll be punished."

1036
01:39:47,421 --> 01:39:48,587
She's there. Come on.

1037
01:39:56,272 --> 01:39:57,472
Hey, are you okay?

1038
01:39:58,757 --> 01:39:59,757
Are you okay?

1039
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:09,560
Hello, Arun...

1040
01:40:09,876 --> 01:40:10,876
She's safe.

1041
01:40:17,383 --> 01:40:18,383
It's success.

1042
01:40:31,345 --> 01:40:32,345
It's okay.

1043
01:40:53,924 --> 01:40:55,869
Is this the work station of SAFE app?

1044
01:40:56,049 --> 01:40:57,049
Yes.

1045
01:40:57,119 --> 01:40:58,916
Isn't this a service apartment?

1046
01:40:59,611 --> 01:41:01,347
Yes. Can I help you with something?

1047
01:41:01,372 --> 01:41:03,511
Yes. One black coffee without sugar.

1048
01:41:04,363 --> 01:41:05,363
Check upstairs.

1049
01:41:06,636 --> 01:41:07,703
You check there.

1050
01:41:08,369 --> 01:41:10,877
Take only those things related to the app.

1051
01:41:11,681 --> 01:41:12,748
What is it, sir?

1052
01:41:34,897 --> 01:41:36,631
-Have you checked everything? 
-Yes.

1053
01:41:37,884 --> 01:41:39,218
Laptop and harddisk.

1054
01:41:40,567 --> 01:41:41,567
Only these two.

1055
01:41:42,219 --> 01:41:45,047
Make a list of these things 
and get their signature.

1056
01:41:45,235 --> 01:41:46,745
-Make it fast. 
-Okay sir.

1057
01:41:55,236 --> 01:41:56,259
-Excuse me sir. 
-Yes?

1058
01:41:56,476 --> 01:41:59,546
Sir, if there is any problem, we 
can sit over here and discuss.

1059
01:41:59,593 --> 01:42:01,625
We'll definitely talk. But not here.

1060
01:42:02,031 --> 01:42:03,031
At my office.

1061
01:42:04,134 --> 01:42:05,470
Ask your lawyer to meet me.

1062
01:42:09,416 --> 01:42:10,416
Excuse me...

1063
01:42:12,822 --> 01:42:13,822
Who is that?

1064
01:42:14,033 --> 01:42:16,366
Thank God you're here. 
Check this.

1065
01:42:17,611 --> 01:42:18,806
Hello, father.

1066
01:42:19,056 --> 01:42:21,424
Both the parties are trying to 
have Arundathi on their party.

1067
01:42:23,063 --> 01:42:24,063
What do you think, Father?

1068
01:42:24,088 --> 01:42:26,022
I also have the same opinion.

1069
01:42:26,460 --> 01:42:28,952
The problems in Nadakavu 
can't be controlled easily.

1070
01:42:29,048 --> 01:42:31,219
We need an eligible candidate.

1071
01:42:32,117 --> 01:42:33,203
Arundathi should come forward.

1072
01:42:33,269 --> 01:42:35,894
No, Father. Arun's intention is different.

1073
01:42:35,919 --> 01:42:39,496
If I get into politics, I wouldn't 
ask discounts for surgeries, right?

1074
01:42:40,325 --> 01:42:41,325
No. Never.

1075
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:42,760
You deserve it.

1076
01:42:42,979 --> 01:42:46,268
You've got the leadership qualities for it. 
And you're honest as well.

1077
01:42:46,819 --> 01:42:49,019
Nadakavu needs a leader like you.

1078
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:52,978
We want to enjoy once you become the MLA.

1079
01:42:57,267 --> 01:42:59,001
Arundathi, an emergency.

1080
01:42:59,259 --> 01:43:00,259
Excuse me.

1081
01:43:00,767 --> 01:43:01,767
Sini, tell me.

1082
01:43:21,854 --> 01:43:22,854
Sir...

1083
01:43:23,167 --> 01:43:24,167
Yes?

1084
01:43:24,307 --> 01:43:25,641
I was asked to come.

1085
01:43:27,315 --> 01:43:28,315
Arundathi?

1086
01:43:28,456 --> 01:43:29,456
Yes.

1087
01:43:31,425 --> 01:43:33,776
I needed a small explanation.

1088
01:43:35,676 --> 01:43:38,151
What is the true intention 
of your application?

1089
01:43:40,319 --> 01:43:44,936
Hacking Kerala government's cyber 
system is not a small thing.

1090
01:43:46,362 --> 01:43:47,714
Are you making a fool out of us?

1091
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:51,823
Sir, do you have any proof 
that it was done by us?

1092
01:43:54,206 --> 01:44:00,272
Do you think our high end technologies and 
highly qualified professionals are doing nothing?

1093
01:44:01,585 --> 01:44:06,319
The IP number of the system that 
was used for hacking yesterday...

1094
01:44:07,029 --> 01:44:10,865
It's that of your laptop at your office 
situated in the service apartment.

1095
01:44:11,723 --> 01:44:15,268
That is why we raided the place 
and seized the equipment.

1096
01:44:15,942 --> 01:44:20,209
This application is a joint effort 
by including you people also.

1097
01:44:20,754 --> 01:44:22,770
It prevents the crime before it happens.

1098
01:44:23,848 --> 01:44:26,137
Madam, is this an explanation?

1099
01:44:27,645 --> 01:44:30,074
Don't you know you shouldn't 
take the law into your hands?

1100
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:34,025
You're trying to run a parallel government.

1101
01:44:34,714 --> 01:44:36,026
It's a criminal offense.

1102
01:44:36,996 --> 01:44:42,248
If it's proved that it was you or your 
team behind yesterday's happenings,

1103
01:44:43,261 --> 01:44:45,660
I'll not allow you to function.

1104
01:44:47,301 --> 01:44:50,902
And I warn you, it won't be safe anymore.

1105
01:44:52,549 --> 01:44:53,549
You got it?

1106
01:44:54,611 --> 01:44:55,611
Clear?

1107
01:44:56,672 --> 01:44:57,672
Okay then.

1108
01:44:58,025 --> 01:44:59,025
Please.

1109
01:45:10,648 --> 01:45:12,758
Why are you here? 
Your department got changed?

1110
01:45:13,422 --> 01:45:15,554
Cyber squad is a desk job.

1111
01:45:15,797 --> 01:45:16,833
I'm a field officer.

1112
01:45:18,511 --> 01:45:21,322
We've a doubt if it's the team that 
hacked the cyber server is the one...

1113
01:45:21,347 --> 01:45:24,493
...who hacked the CCTV at Mahadevan's.

1114
01:45:25,308 --> 01:45:26,308
So, I'm here.

1115
01:45:27,965 --> 01:45:29,498
Though she's my sister,

1116
01:45:30,144 --> 01:45:33,744
didn't she gift me a suspension 
through her come back.

1117
01:45:35,160 --> 01:45:37,724
So shouldn't I also give her a return gift?

1118
01:45:39,349 --> 01:45:41,865
So is this the reward for serving people?

1119
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:45,247
So, you have reached the finishing point.

1120
01:45:45,454 --> 01:45:46,454
No.

1121
01:45:46,532 --> 01:45:47,532
Not at all.

1122
01:45:48,024 --> 01:45:49,737
It was my father who taught me chess.

1123
01:45:51,024 --> 01:45:51,923
He always used to say...

1124
01:45:53,028 --> 01:45:55,177
that the checkmate is the last move.

1125
01:45:57,200 --> 01:45:57,859
Okay.

1126
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,084
Arundathi, I forgot something.

1127
01:46:02,826 --> 01:46:03,842
I'd gone to Kannur.

1128
01:46:04,514 --> 01:46:06,374
Ishwari Amma and Lekshmi 
conveyed their regards.

1129
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:23,323
"The last date to give nominations for 
Nadakavu by-election is tomorrow"

1130
01:46:30,707 --> 01:46:32,136
What happened?

1131
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:33,636
I'll tell you.

1132
01:47:05,996 --> 01:47:06,996
Coffee.

1133
01:47:08,918 --> 01:47:11,121
Shall we file the nomination?

1134
01:47:11,511 --> 01:47:12,511
What?

1135
01:47:13,556 --> 01:47:15,697
Shall I file the nomination?

1136
01:47:16,243 --> 01:47:17,704
Are you serious?

1137
01:47:18,072 --> 01:47:19,072
Really?

1138
01:47:20,922 --> 01:47:22,369
Don't get so excited. 
Will it happen?

1139
01:47:22,494 --> 01:47:25,294
Of course. But it means I've lots of work.

1140
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:26,400
Carry on.

1141
01:47:45,472 --> 01:47:47,051
Guys, listen.

1142
01:47:47,293 --> 01:47:48,293
I've a news.

1143
01:47:48,847 --> 01:47:51,249
Arundathi is going to file the nomination.

1144
01:47:52,336 --> 01:47:53,336
Really?

1145
01:47:53,897 --> 01:47:54,897
Oh, God!

1146
01:47:57,024 --> 01:48:03,214
The video of the woman who was 
rescued last night has gone viral.

1147
01:48:03,384 --> 01:48:06,796
When I downloaded the app SAFE,

1148
01:48:07,290 --> 01:48:09,821
I never thought it'd become helpful 
in such a crucial situation.

1149
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:12,399
I'm so glad that I downloaded this app.

1150
01:48:12,633 --> 01:48:13,337
I'm safe.

1151
01:48:16,356 --> 01:48:18,622
I'm so glad that I downloaded this app.

1152
01:48:18,989 --> 01:48:19,989
I'm safe.

1153
01:49:03,098 --> 01:49:05,253
-All the best. 
-Thank you. All the best to you too.

1154
01:49:45,374 --> 01:49:46,907
We have downloaded SAFE app.

1155
01:49:47,225 --> 01:49:48,559
We're ready to help.

1156
01:50:22,448 --> 01:50:25,109
Arundathi should win if something 
should happen in Nadakavu.

1157
01:50:25,664 --> 01:50:28,058
Our first vote goes to Arundathi. 
We're safe.

1158
01:50:28,167 --> 01:50:29,781
We're with Arundathi. 
We're safe.

1159
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:44,666
"The public campaigning at 
Nadakavu has come to an end"

1160
01:50:45,110 --> 01:50:46,336
"The election is on Monday"

1161
01:50:46,708 --> 01:50:48,778
"The next two days are 
for silent campaigning"

1162
01:50:48,981 --> 01:50:51,181
"The result will be out on Friday"

1163
01:51:17,390 --> 01:51:21,669
"Who's going to win the 
Nadakavu by-election"

1164
01:51:22,653 --> 01:51:24,530
"Coming back to the figures..."

1165
01:51:25,098 --> 01:51:30,096
"IDF contestant V.K. Thomas 
is leading by 1195 votes"

1166
01:51:30,808 --> 01:51:36,088
"The opposition thinks the Devanathan 
Trust case might become a setback for IDF"

1167
01:51:36,682 --> 01:51:39,604
"Moving on to the bastions of IDF,"

1168
01:51:39,909 --> 01:51:45,624
"Will they win or lose their seat at Nadakavu?

1169
01:51:45,694 --> 01:51:46,983
"Here is the latest news"

1170
01:51:47,377 --> 01:51:51,018
"Arundathi Das is leading in IDF's bastion"

1171
01:51:52,052 --> 01:51:57,077
"Independent candidate Arundathi 
Das is leading with 36,816 votes"

1172
01:51:57,392 --> 01:51:58,392
Shall we eat?

1173
01:51:58,463 --> 01:52:02,921
"IDF candidate C.K. Thomas has 33,215 votes"

1174
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:07,009
"And Nishanth Nair has 27,743 votes"

1175
01:52:07,623 --> 01:52:11,533
"Now Arundathi is leading by 3601 votes"

1176
01:52:11,706 --> 01:52:14,104
"They are yet to count 
the votes in two places"

1177
01:52:14,194 --> 01:52:16,068
"Those are IDF's bastions"

1178
01:52:16,768 --> 01:52:23,127
"In the Nadakavu by-election, 
Arundathi Das has won by 24210 votes"

1179
01:53:00,013 --> 01:53:04,005
I'd like to thank all the voters 
of Nadakavu constituency.

1180
01:53:04,591 --> 01:53:05,958
This is a historical win.

1181
01:53:06,652 --> 01:53:08,143
The victory of the commoners.

1182
01:53:08,871 --> 01:53:14,193
Should I thank you for selecting a social 
activist irrespective of the party or...

1183
01:53:14,909 --> 01:53:25,448
Should I be mad at you for selecting a 
leader without trying to know her past.

1184
01:53:25,775 --> 01:53:26,464
-Vani? 
-Yes, ma'am.

1185
01:53:26,489 --> 01:53:30,754
When a leader is selected, 
people believe in them.

1186
01:53:31,725 --> 01:53:35,897
Justice which is everyone's 
birthright will be protected.

1187
01:53:36,727 --> 01:53:39,521
The ones who safeguard it are 
the people's representatives.

1188
01:53:40,107 --> 01:53:47,082
I wish to take you all 15 years 
backwards through my victory speech.

1189
01:53:48,052 --> 01:53:51,810
That is why I chose this stage.

1190
01:53:52,588 --> 01:53:55,501
In this same campus, on a college day...

1191
01:53:56,705 --> 01:53:57,771
A 19 year old...

1192
01:53:59,225 --> 01:54:04,042
She was rejoicing after the best 
dance performance of her life.

1193
01:54:07,235 --> 01:54:08,502
From that corridor...

1194
01:54:11,961 --> 01:54:12,961
She flew away.

1195
01:54:14,071 --> 01:54:15,258
Without telling anyone.

1196
01:54:29,663 --> 01:54:31,063
Mahadevan, come here.

1197
01:54:32,887 --> 01:54:34,587
Shweta has gone that way. 
She's alone.

1198
01:54:34,767 --> 01:54:36,509
Go and call Idikula.

1199
01:54:39,592 --> 01:54:40,658
This looks good.

1200
01:55:12,041 --> 01:55:13,041
Get out!

1201
01:55:14,991 --> 01:55:15,991
Get out!

1202
01:55:23,741 --> 01:55:25,008
It's going to rain.

1203
01:55:25,452 --> 01:55:26,452
Let's go.

1204
01:55:27,593 --> 01:55:29,889
Shivaraman, I won't be there tomorrow.

1205
01:55:30,093 --> 01:55:31,136
Okay.

1206
01:56:04,749 --> 01:56:05,749
My God!

1207
01:56:32,818 --> 01:56:36,098
"Do you know season..."

1208
01:56:36,799 --> 01:56:40,672
"To be a journey in search of life"

1209
01:56:40,842 --> 01:56:48,523
"Will you fill up my life 
as sun blossoming light"

1210
01:56:48,767 --> 01:56:56,220
"Going faraway in search of shores as time"

1211
01:56:56,752 --> 01:57:04,526
"To spread as fire with burning eyes"

1212
01:57:07,993 --> 01:57:08,993
My father...

1213
01:57:10,485 --> 01:57:13,085
If he sees me like this, he won't live.

1214
01:57:14,732 --> 01:57:15,798
He's a poor man.

1215
01:57:17,124 --> 01:57:18,780
Without me...

1216
01:57:20,898 --> 01:57:21,898
I won't go.

1217
01:57:22,383 --> 01:57:25,276
Dear, you can go back if you want.

1218
01:57:27,492 --> 01:57:29,185
You can take revenge on your enemies.

1219
01:57:29,629 --> 01:57:30,629
I'll help you.

1220
01:57:32,075 --> 01:57:32,978
That is what I also did.

1221
01:57:34,565 --> 01:57:38,635
I killed the men who murdered 
my daughter one by one.

1222
01:57:40,549 --> 01:57:42,038
But what did I get in return...

1223
01:57:43,088 --> 01:57:46,588
A punishment scarier than death.

1224
01:57:48,523 --> 01:57:50,056
This fire inside you...

1225
01:57:51,554 --> 01:57:52,554
it should burn fiercely.

1226
01:57:53,421 --> 01:57:54,421
For you.

1227
01:57:55,889 --> 01:57:57,873
For my daughter Arundathi.

1228
01:58:00,712 --> 01:58:09,064
"With new blood running 
through you and a single thought"

1229
01:58:09,141 --> 01:58:16,777
"Come to get immersed in 
cold mind with soft sound"

1230
01:58:32,656 --> 01:58:36,272
"In these paths soar"

1231
01:58:36,522 --> 01:58:40,493
"Your steps get imprinted"

1232
01:58:40,657 --> 01:58:45,023
"My mind becomes cool"

1233
01:58:48,629 --> 01:58:52,621
"In these paths soar"

1234
01:58:52,668 --> 01:58:56,778
"Your steps get imprinted"

1235
01:58:56,778 --> 01:59:00,815
"My mind becomes cool"

1236
01:59:04,666 --> 01:59:08,530
"Flowers devoid of honey..."

1237
01:59:08,777 --> 01:59:12,059
"Wounds that put an end to the thoughts..."

1238
01:59:12,930 --> 01:59:16,000
"Come floating in the bright moonlight"

1239
01:59:16,188 --> 01:59:20,516
"You are a butterfly soaring 
high with golden wings"

1240
01:59:20,541 --> 01:59:23,914
"Do you know seasons..."

1241
01:59:24,627 --> 01:59:28,132
"To be a journey in search of life"

1242
01:59:28,469 --> 01:59:36,550
"Will you fill up my life 
as sun blossoming light"

1243
01:59:36,589 --> 01:59:44,340
"Going faraway in search of shores as time"

1244
01:59:44,547 --> 01:59:52,082
"To spread as fire with burning eyes"

1245
01:59:52,215 --> 02:00:01,022
"With new blood running 
through you and a single thought"

1246
02:00:01,507 --> 02:00:08,774
"Come to get immersed in 
cold mind with soft sound"

1247
02:00:19,883 --> 02:00:23,136
She has my mother's hazel eyes.

1248
02:00:23,729 --> 02:00:26,206
Did Swetha come here for 
your father's funeral?

1249
02:00:37,727 --> 02:00:38,727
Sreya...

1250
02:00:41,241 --> 02:00:42,241
Come here.

1251
02:00:50,572 --> 02:00:53,572
I was the answer to Ishwar 
Das's idea of SAFE.

1252
02:00:54,384 --> 02:00:57,244
I borrowed his deceased 
daughter Arunathi's identity.

1253
02:00:57,632 --> 02:01:01,492
That one reason is enough for me to 
get disqualified from this election.

1254
02:01:14,171 --> 02:01:16,171
We should all understand one thing.

1255
02:01:16,499 --> 02:01:18,108
Even for a big criminal,

1256
02:01:19,054 --> 02:01:22,187
it's easy to get into politics.

1257
02:01:29,244 --> 02:01:32,276
Even for a terrorist.

1258
02:01:32,555 --> 02:01:34,836
Because there are no 
qualifications or criteria.

1259
02:01:35,883 --> 02:01:38,525
That has to change or we should change it.

1260
02:01:38,802 --> 02:01:40,069
The ones we select,

1261
02:01:40,888 --> 02:01:44,520
should make sure every citizen gets 
the justice and equality he deserves.

1262
02:01:45,429 --> 02:01:48,093
Or they should be the ones 
who safeguard our laws.

1263
02:01:49,015 --> 02:01:51,526
There are many people 
like that in our society.

1264
02:01:51,745 --> 02:01:53,338
They should be coming forward.

1265
02:01:53,784 --> 02:01:55,384
We should find out them.

1266
02:01:55,846 --> 02:01:59,213
Anyway, I'm going to stop my solitary life.

1267
02:01:59,602 --> 02:02:03,202
I don't intend to waste the money 
in our treasury by taking the oath.

1268
02:02:04,245 --> 02:02:09,687
Someone who is ready to give 
what you need by being with you.

1269
02:02:10,458 --> 02:02:13,192
Someone like that should take that place.

1270
02:02:14,482 --> 02:02:15,482
Nishanth Nair.

1271
02:02:15,857 --> 02:02:17,257
Our former collector.

1272
02:02:19,131 --> 02:02:20,465
Sir, please come up.

1273
02:02:33,837 --> 02:02:37,165
I'm not going anywhere by 
handing over all this to him.

1274
02:02:37,611 --> 02:02:41,095
I'll be here as Arundathi and Shweta.

1275
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:47,318
Congrats sir. The stage is yours.

1276
02:02:50,289 --> 02:02:51,623
Thank you Arundathi.

1277
02:02:51,992 --> 02:02:55,617
I'm extremely happy to see you all.

1278
02:03:32,738 --> 02:03:35,523
Aunt, you took time to get here, right?

1279
02:03:39,471 --> 02:03:42,664
I didn't give you any gift 
for getting IPS, right?

1280
02:03:44,073 --> 02:03:45,722
Here. Keep it.

1281
02:03:49,611 --> 02:03:50,611
Checkmate?

1282
02:03:54,570 --> 02:03:55,756
Look what it is.

1283
02:04:27,418 --> 02:04:28,587
Check for this in the parking lot.

1284
02:04:29,933 --> 02:04:31,139
Look for this vehicle number.

1285
02:04:31,335 --> 02:04:32,601
Deepan, check this.

1286
02:04:33,784 --> 02:04:34,773
Check everywhere.

1287
02:04:36,905 --> 02:04:37,905
Savan, here.

1288
02:04:39,513 --> 02:04:40,513
Who is it?

1289
02:04:40,958 --> 02:04:42,001
Who are you people?

1290
02:04:42,527 --> 02:04:43,980
Why have you put me here?

1291
02:04:44,543 --> 02:04:45,543
Who is it?

1292
02:04:47,157 --> 02:04:48,157
Who is it?

1293
02:04:49,532 --> 02:04:50,532
Who are you?

1294
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:55,880
Who are you?

1295
02:04:56,638 --> 02:04:58,379
-Vani, go. 
-What do you want?

1296
02:04:58,575 --> 02:04:59,575
Close the door.

1297
02:05:00,348 --> 02:05:01,348
Who are you?

1298
02:05:26,229 --> 02:05:27,629
Didn't I tell you everything?

1299
02:05:28,182 --> 02:05:29,773
I told you everything I know.

1300
02:05:30,297 --> 02:05:31,497
See, I'm a doctor.

1301
02:05:32,148 --> 02:05:33,348
Show some manners.

1302
02:05:33,726 --> 02:05:35,060
It's been many days.

1303
02:05:36,109 --> 02:05:37,109
Who are you?

1304
02:05:50,565 --> 02:05:54,940
The foolish and the dead alone 
never change their opinions.

1305
02:05:58,412 --> 02:05:59,745
James Russell Lowell.

1306
02:06:01,538 --> 02:06:02,538
So...

1307
02:06:04,229 --> 02:06:05,126
Shall we begin?
