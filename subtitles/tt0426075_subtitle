1
00:01:33,774 --> 00:01:35,105
The Line.

2
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:40,436
This is the story of relations,
feelings, love and emotions.

3
00:01:40,614 --> 00:01:42,844
This is the story of Arjun.

4
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:47,447
Like that, Arjun was a orphan
and helpless child.

5
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:50,283
Who had none in this world.
But when a man known as...

6
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:53,349
...Suraj Rana took him under
his fold, gave him a name...

7
00:01:53,427 --> 00:01:56,419
...and a recognition,
then this same...

8
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,795
...Arjun became Arjun
Rana from Arjun.

9
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,631
Suraj Rana. Like that. He was
related with every illegal...

10
00:02:03,703 --> 00:02:07,195
...business, but he was a
very good man at heart.

11
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:09,398
Therefore, every
body and Arjun...

12
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:12,411
...would regard him
as Uncle with love.

13
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,143
Arjun learnt every intricacy
of business from his uncle.

14
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,308
He learnt every
line which Suraj...

15
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:21,650
...Rana had made
by his principles.

16
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:24,549
Arjun never crossed that line and...

17
00:02:24,624 --> 00:02:27,491
...nor did he let anyone
else cross it too.

18
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:32,157
Happiness doesn't stay with
one all through his life.

19
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:34,223
And this is what happened
with Arjun too.

20
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:38,771
His uncle didn't stay with
him for long. He expired.

21
00:02:38,839 --> 00:02:42,832
But after him, he left all
the responsibilities...

22
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:47,243
...of business on Arjun.
And a sweet relation.

23
00:02:47,414 --> 00:02:50,178
Uncle's son, Karan.

24
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:54,677
Arjun loved Karan more
than his own life.

25
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,563
Today in many areas of Mumbai
city such crowds will be seen.

26
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:45,628
Arjun Rana, like that,
he is a underworld don.

27
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:47,229
But looking at the love of
the people for him...

28
00:03:47,407 --> 00:03:48,738
...it seems that he is more than
their blood brother to them.

29
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:50,799
Why not? He has worked
a lot for poor people.

30
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:53,903
He has put up factories and
mills for unemployed youth.

31
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:57,916
He has opened orphanages for orphans,
Widow Institutions for widows.

32
00:03:57,984 --> 00:04:00,418
In fact he even arranges for
the marriage of poor girls.

33
00:04:05,992 --> 00:04:09,928
I am Aditya from Juhu Chowpatty.

34
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,931
This live footage that you're
seeing is taken from there.

35
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:15,467
As you can see there are
many arrangements here.

36
00:04:15,535 --> 00:04:16,559
And such arrangements haven't...

37
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:18,433
...been done for any Minister
too till today.

38
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:21,431
This is Suraj Nagar.

39
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:23,533
The settlement which Arjun's
uncle had put up.

40
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:28,781
Arjun has spent his childhood
with these dwellers right here.

41
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:33,615
Happy birthday, Arjun.

42
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:38,616
If you would be us today,
it would be so nice.

43
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,789
Well, wherever you are, be happy.

44
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:43,852
May you have many more
lovers like this!

45
00:06:16,056 --> 00:06:18,786
Happy birthday, brother. - 
Happy birthday, brother.

46
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:22,051
Your birthday has been
celebrated throughout...

47
00:06:22,128 --> 00:06:25,461
...the night in the whole
city. Such lighting!

48
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,556
I haven't even seen
so many fireworks...

49
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:29,625
...even during Diwali
and Eid, brother.

50
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,861
I got tears in my eyes
seeing all this.

51
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:35,564
Should I tell you
a truth, brother?

52
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:38,576
These people's love shelters you.

53
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:45,075
Even I believe that. But today
I am missing that shelter...

54
00:06:45,151 --> 00:06:52,080
...due to whose absence, I feel
myself to be wholly lonesome.

55
00:06:56,696 --> 00:06:58,926
I know that uncle isn't
with me any more.

56
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:04,931
But I feel him to be close
to me every moment.

57
00:07:05,705 --> 00:07:11,166
He has held me on every step
and decision of life.

58
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:14,605
He never gave me a chance
to be stubborn.

59
00:07:15,115 --> 00:07:17,106
Especially, on my birthday.
So many...

60
00:07:17,183 --> 00:07:20,118
...of my wishes would be fulfilled.

61
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:22,120
And you named everything that...

62
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:24,122
...you owned to Karan and
Bindiya on this day?

63
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,715
There wasn't any will
of uncle like this too.

64
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:28,784
And you didn't keep anything
for yourself?

65
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:34,133
I have. Uncle's name. What
else would an orphan want?

66
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:38,536
Karan is uncle's real son.
All this is his, isn't it?

67
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:40,469
And as far as
Bindiya is concerned.

68
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:46,135
You know it, Anees. Her father
has done much for this house.

69
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:50,480
Bindiya's father's death
wasn't an accident.

70
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,745
He had given up his
life for uncle' sake.

71
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,984
Tell me, is all this worth
more than that? No.

72
00:07:59,225 --> 00:08:03,662
I don't know if I would ever
be able to repay his debt.

73
00:08:08,168 --> 00:08:12,662
Bindiya was three years old,
when her father expired.

74
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,766
Uncle had brought her home.

75
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:21,839
And he gave her responsibilities
to me.

76
00:08:25,785 --> 00:08:29,516
By looking after Karan and
Bindiya I have repaid uncle.

77
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:33,853
But I am scared of one thing.
- Scare? What scare, brother?

78
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:38,196
Just this. That there isn't any
thing left in their bringing up.

79
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:41,256
I have no worries about Bindiya.

80
00:08:41,701 --> 00:08:43,134
If I have any worries,
they are about Karan.

81
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:44,795
What worries do you
have about Karan?

82
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:47,203
By the grace Allah,
he has grown up now.

83
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:48,934
And that's what I worry about.

84
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:52,876
Karan has walked by holding
my finger. He's grown up now.

85
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:56,880
It shouldn't be that he walks
on this path following me.

86
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:59,817
Which neither uncle wanted,
and nor me.

87
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:26,908
Karan sir, juice. - Bring it.

88
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,987
This is for brother.

89
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:51,760
Happy birthday, brother.

90
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,363
You won't call me dear?

91
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,771
You have started to speak a lot.

92
00:10:03,349 --> 00:10:05,340
Where is my gift?

93
00:10:27,974 --> 00:10:30,966
Wow, it looks so
good in your hands.

94
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:36,043
Brother, even I have a passion
for listening to praises.

95
00:10:37,717 --> 00:10:39,810
It's good. - Just a
minute, brother!

96
00:11:32,171 --> 00:11:34,196
Tell me brother.

97
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:40,369
Mr. Rana, Bindiya has
won the move this time.

98
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:46,377
Brother, I bought this gift for
you according to you personality.

99
00:11:46,452 --> 00:11:48,443
And this... this universal
gift, anyone...

100
00:11:48,521 --> 00:11:50,318
...can buy it for anybody,
understood?

101
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,449
It's okay brother. Tell me that
you didn't like my gift.

102
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:57,894
No. I like it very much.
It guards one.

103
00:11:58,231 --> 00:12:00,222
But Karan, if it saves someone's...

104
00:12:00,299 --> 00:12:02,893
...life then it takes
other's lives too.

105
00:12:03,336 --> 00:12:07,898
And flowers, they spread
color and aroma in life.

106
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:12,411
Actually, there is a vast
difference between these two gifts.

107
00:12:13,413 --> 00:12:15,404
Just like there's between the
two us. - What did you say?

108
00:12:15,481 --> 00:12:18,473
No. Nothing. - See, brother,
he's silent! He's silent!

109
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,411
I'll give you a five, come here!

110
00:12:23,823 --> 00:12:25,916
You're saved because of brother's
knowledge today.

111
00:12:25,992 --> 00:12:28,085
Knowledge, means a lecture!

112
00:12:28,928 --> 00:12:32,420
Am I giving a lecture? - No,
brother. No. - Then what?

113
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:35,365
Actually, the age difference
between you and me...

114
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:40,438
Oh! Old man! Brother, old man!
- You called me an old man?

115
00:12:40,506 --> 00:12:42,030
She did. I didn't say it!

116
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:44,099
What's the age difference
between us?

117
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:45,769
Very less, brother. - Yes, then?

118
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:49,504
But actually, sometimes,
you can't do what I can.

119
00:12:52,118 --> 00:12:53,779
Just a minute! Just a minute!

120
00:12:53,953 --> 00:12:55,944
What is that which you
can do and I can't?

121
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:57,480
Brother, there is nothing like that.

122
00:12:57,557 --> 00:13:00,287
No, you tell me, what is such
that you can and I can't.

123
00:13:00,359 --> 00:13:03,123
Oh! My mother! Sorry brother.
I'm going to college.

124
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:04,458
Just a minute.

125
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:09,198
Brother, you are going to the
office. And you to the college.

126
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:10,292
Yes.

127
00:13:47,507 --> 00:13:53,173
'The princes have come out
on their royal vehicles.'

128
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:59,182
'Oh! Send fie to the worldly wise! '

129
00:13:59,585 --> 00:14:03,180
'There are lakhs of stars, but
they hide in the daytime.'

130
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:09,459
'We are those stars which
glitter everyday! '

131
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,076
' From the dancing waves, take
this message from us.'

132
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:03,578
'We flow faster than you.'

133
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:08,245
'We give birth to storms.'

134
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,656
'We have on our feet on this earth.'

135
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:15,654
'We have our sights on that sky.'

136
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:21,658
' Every sight bows, with
just a look of ours.'

137
00:15:22,268 --> 00:15:24,930
'What is the standing of flowers... '

138
00:15:25,104 --> 00:15:27,664
'We have our hold on that aroma.'

139
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:24,997
'There are gatherings
full of colors here.'

140
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:30,661
'There is hair settled
in aroma here.'

141
00:16:30,736 --> 00:16:36,675
'There is color somewhere,
and simplicity somewhere.'

142
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:43,170
' But we search that here... '

143
00:17:12,712 --> 00:17:14,703
Hey, move aside, smart guy!

144
00:17:20,653 --> 00:17:22,712
Hey, you six foot! I will bury
you twelve feet into the ground.

145
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:24,380
Brother, he was irritating
Maria, right now.

146
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:26,049
Hey, you irritate Maria! Get lost!

147
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:28,216
Don't touch me I shall beat you.

148
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:31,057
What happened, leave
it. - Who are you?

149
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:36,463
Whoever I am. You go from here,
Go away. - If I hit you one!

150
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:40,066
Hey! Wretch! Silent!

151
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:45,802
Sanju leave him. Let
him go. Go, son go...

152
00:17:46,746 --> 00:17:48,737
Hey. You beard, what
were you barking? - 

153
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:50,475
Hey, kid, your hands work a lot!

154
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:53,876
Do you know who I am?
I am Usmaan s man

155
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:03,151
Who is Usmaan? Tell that
I have created dispute...

156
00:18:03,262 --> 00:18:06,095
...with Sanju. Go,
go and tell him.

157
00:18:06,766 --> 00:18:09,758
Sanju, Usmaan
talks so much about you.

158
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,167
Yes, Sanju. - 
He takes your name!

159
00:18:12,271 --> 00:18:14,262
Hey, don't touch, go away
from here. Yes, brother.

160
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,500
Go, eating footage unnecessarily,
go now.

161
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:16,598
Sanju I am leaving.
- Get out of there.

162
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:17,699
Sanju - Say sorry to Tanya
- Yes Sanju.

163
00:18:17,777 --> 00:18:18,801
Thank you, brother. - Please
go, don't create a crowd.

164
00:18:18,878 --> 00:18:22,109
Thank you Sanju. - Uncle! How
are you? - I'm fine brother.

165
00:18:22,281 --> 00:18:24,442
Go and concentrate on your
studies. - Surely, brother.

166
00:18:26,185 --> 00:18:29,518
Wow, Sanju! It has become
so much credit for you.

167
00:18:30,456 --> 00:18:32,447
It's growing, isn't it? - Yes.

168
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,686
You'll see one day it's
more that Arjun Rana.

169
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:37,128
More than Arjun Rana too?

170
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:42,532
Why? It may not become, why? - Hey,
call for tea. - Yes, brother.

171
00:18:43,636 --> 00:18:45,399
Sanju, should I tell you one thing.

172
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:48,804
You are a very well connected
man, a clever man.

173
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,472
No, not now. I have make
them, connections. - 

174
00:18:54,213 --> 00:18:57,148
Connections. You're bragging,
Isn't it?

175
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:59,309
Why...

176
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:03,319
Just a minute, Sanju you brag so
much! One side you are saying...

177
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:07,382
...that you have to create
connections and other side...

178
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,452
...since Arjun Rana's car has
come, nor have you touched it...

179
00:19:10,529 --> 00:19:13,828
...nor have you allowed
us to touch it.

180
00:19:13,899 --> 00:19:16,493
Should I let you touch? Yes?
- Hey! - I'll let you right away!

181
00:19:18,237 --> 00:19:20,398
Hey, move aside!
What are you doing?

182
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:22,668
Hey, let me kiss the car. You
don't let me kiss the car.

183
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,231
What kind of a person are you?
- Get away.

184
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:27,911
What are you doing? You are acting
as if he is your brother, Sahil.

185
00:19:28,514 --> 00:19:31,347
You tell me one thing that
if it is to choose...

186
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:33,578
...between the two, whom
would you choose?

187
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:37,520
Tell me. Don't think.
Tell me. See lbrahim.

188
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,787
I'm not thinking, I am stunned on
your question... - Why brother?

189
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,194
This car is our dream. Sahil
is my life, my life.

190
00:19:45,364 --> 00:19:48,197
He is my life too. - He is
everyone's life. Everyone's life.

191
00:19:48,267 --> 00:19:51,759
If I could, I would keep ten cars
like this to serve Sahil.

192
00:19:51,837 --> 00:19:54,931
But what can I do? My fate!

193
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,601
What are you saying Sanju!
It's wrong.

194
00:19:57,676 --> 00:20:00,543
You send him to such a high,
super high funda...

195
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:03,207
...college, where the kids of
all these rich people go.

196
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:06,877
Montu, there is one thing.
Our Sahil stays with them...

197
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:10,547
...and studies with them.
But he's very different.

198
00:20:12,391 --> 00:20:19,490
He is very simple, innocent,
My Sahil.

199
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:55,593
Thanks.

200
00:20:55,668 --> 00:20:57,932
There are tournaments
and matches for that.

201
00:20:58,003 --> 00:20:59,937
You will get certificates for that.

202
00:21:00,005 --> 00:21:02,599
There is no enjoyment in playing
basket ball. - Why

203
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,870
Base ball is my favourite game. -

204
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,435
There is an excitement
in making goals there.

205
00:21:07,513 --> 00:21:10,744
How do you make goals in basketball?
- Sir, actually, in Baseball...

206
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:14,274
Sir, I will tell you sir, Baseball's
Score is in the basket ball court.

207
00:21:15,454 --> 00:21:16,887
Basket ball court? - Now,
in the basket ball court.

208
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:18,617
Baseball in Basket ball court

209
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,556
Sir, I will tell you sir,
in the basket ball court...

210
00:22:09,074 --> 00:22:16,879
'This world will wave
our flag everyday.'

211
00:22:16,949 --> 00:22:23,946
'This arena will become our
second symbol of victory'

212
00:22:24,023 --> 00:22:27,686
'We will run fast, and make
goals with stealth.'

213
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,526
' Everyone will be stunned and
stare whenever we play the game.'

214
00:22:31,697 --> 00:22:35,531
"We are the one! We are the one! '

215
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,170
'The breeze has come,
the storm has come.

216
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,443
It has slid and it has danced.'

217
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:01,953
' He has won, he has been defeated,
that hullababalloo is here today.'

218
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:09,187
'We will walk down from
the stars today.

219
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:14,528
We will glitter more
than the moon.'

220
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,624
Come, meet me in the cafe.

221
00:24:16,702 --> 00:24:18,465
You were staring at me, isn't it?

222
00:24:18,771 --> 00:24:23,640
We will play to the full,
we are so charming!

223
00:25:08,187 --> 00:25:11,179
And you are looking very nice too.
- No.

224
00:25:11,857 --> 00:25:15,520
Is it yes or... yes, no

225
00:25:15,694 --> 00:25:17,685
You dance very well.

226
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:21,691
And you look very beautiful!

227
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:28,029
That's it. I had come
to play Basketball.

228
00:25:28,106 --> 00:25:29,539
Basketball. And you?

229
00:25:33,812 --> 00:25:37,873
And Basketlball... well
that is Karan's game.

230
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:52,561
Our second home. He has come Boss,

231
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:55,156
What is this large drink?
- See, this my fifth drink.

232
00:25:55,234 --> 00:25:58,226
Sanju, thirty sixth... - Don't drink
Sanju, don't drink it. - Why?

233
00:25:58,737 --> 00:26:00,898
Whoever has drunk this has had
motions and vomiting both together.

234
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:02,304
Then why are you
making me drink it?

235
00:26:02,374 --> 00:26:03,568
I've prepared it with my own hands.
It's Sex on the Beach. Sanju.

236
00:26:03,742 --> 00:26:04,902
Drink it and see once.

237
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:10,975
For my sake. Yes.

238
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:20,316
The studs have come.

239
00:26:22,661 --> 00:26:24,595
What do you mean?

240
00:26:25,264 --> 00:26:26,322
His name is Karan.

241
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:30,600
The younger brother of Arjun Rana.

242
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,601
Which one?

243
00:26:38,877 --> 00:26:40,868
The one in the red jacket.

244
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:45,775
He's got style.

245
00:27:45,744 --> 00:27:47,837
Monty! It's Monty's call.

246
00:27:48,847 --> 00:27:50,007
Yes, Monty.
- The car has to be given!

247
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:51,674
Hey, shut up. Nobody
will go. I'll go.

248
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,681
I'll deliver the car
and come, okay?

249
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:57,149
This Tee shirt, yes, hey friend,
Shoes. - They are okay.

250
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:59,349
Okay, look behind, my pants

251
00:27:59,424 --> 00:28:01,688
Hey, what are you doing? - What
brother, there was some dust here.

252
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,751
There is dust on your face. Dust!

253
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:09,698
Tell my ' hi' to brother. - Yes,
I will tell your 'hi' to him.

254
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:13,033
Hey, where is the key?
- Where is the key?

255
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:15,196
Give me the keys quickly.

256
00:28:23,181 --> 00:28:25,172
Here, your bishop is gone.

257
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,717
Just a minute, how can
this be possible?

258
00:28:26,885 --> 00:28:28,216
Then? How else is it to be?

259
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:30,720
You had killed the bishop right
now, isn't it? - So what?

260
00:28:30,789 --> 00:28:33,314
If you killed it one chance, you
had to leave it the next time,

261
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,054
Take this. - Hey, the knight
doesn't walk like this.

262
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,222
How else does he walk then?

263
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:41,527
He walks that move.
- Which is this move?

264
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,064
What is it? - I've brought the car.

265
00:28:45,804 --> 00:28:47,738
This is Brother's car.
The brother's car.

266
00:28:47,906 --> 00:28:50,136
You are the car mechanic isn't it?
- Yes, Sanju.

267
00:28:50,242 --> 00:28:53,075
My knight will walk like this only.
- What is this?

268
00:28:53,145 --> 00:28:56,478
Bindiya, this is Brother's horse,
He will run as he wishes.

269
00:28:56,548 --> 00:28:58,743
Anil, you keep quiet. What is this?

270
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:03,750
Ok. Take this. This is your move.

271
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:14,156
Are you brother?
- Do I look like a sister to you?

272
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:16,924
No, that isn't the matter.
- Do you recognize me?

273
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:19,835
No - Go. - Okay.

274
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:27,768
It means Javed Brother.
- Car driver.

275
00:29:27,946 --> 00:29:29,436
Pilot.

276
00:29:29,514 --> 00:29:33,507
Yes Pilot. The car was ready.
I had to deliver it.

277
00:29:33,585 --> 00:29:36,383
The car is ready. You delivered
lt. I took the delivery...

278
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:40,448
...now do you wish tea, coffee,
taxi or rickshaw?

279
00:29:40,525 --> 00:29:41,549
No. I just wished to meet Brother.

280
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:43,283
Don't touch this body.
Did you get it?

281
00:29:43,361 --> 00:29:46,125
Hey, not to touch him, understood?

282
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:48,189
You touch the body and see.

283
00:29:48,266 --> 00:29:50,962
Why should I touch your body?
- These people are very dangerous.

284
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:52,060
Oh. I know.

285
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:55,300
Ok. Come on touch me. - 
Who is Javed busy with?

286
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:58,069
C'mon, touch me and show.
- Why should I touch you?

287
00:29:58,143 --> 00:30:01,806
Please touch! - Javed. - Oh God!
- What is going on? Who is he?

288
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,145
Nothing brother, it is a small
matter, I shall handle it.

289
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:08,817
It's nothing. - Hey! - It's useless
drama. Who's doing any drama?

290
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,981
I just came to deliver this car.
- I will wash him up!

291
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:14,992
Give him the phone.
- Talk to Brother.

292
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,823
What happened, what
does he wish to say?

293
00:30:16,895 --> 00:30:20,331
Nothing brother, he is car
mechanic. - Give it to me.

294
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:38,178
Hello - hello.

295
00:30:38,517 --> 00:30:40,917
Salute him, he is 'brother'

296
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,011
Hello brother.
- Hello.

297
00:30:44,089 --> 00:30:46,353
Brother. I'm Sanju.

298
00:30:47,025 --> 00:30:49,050
Yes. Tell me.
- Mechanic, brother.

299
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:50,594
Ok. Give the car to the Javed.

300
00:30:51,596 --> 00:30:53,587
Brother.
- Yes tell me.

301
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:57,123
Brother, the car is very
good. Just take care.

302
00:30:58,203 --> 00:30:59,864
Brother. Please come

303
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:02,600
Just a minute. I'll take
care. Anything else?

304
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:08,203
Brother... I'll slap you! I
always wished to meet you.

305
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,872
Today, that wish is fulfilled.
If my...

306
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,879
...boys hear this they
with go crazy with joy.

307
00:31:12,617 --> 00:31:16,212
Okay, give the phone
to Javed. - Yes brother.

308
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:20,483
Brother, that Dhani uncle has come.

309
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,392
Uncle Dhani has come.
- Brother, where are you going?

310
00:31:23,962 --> 00:31:27,557
I will come back in a jiffy.
- Greetings uncle Dhani.

311
00:31:27,632 --> 00:31:30,100
Greetings - How are you, Arjun?

312
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:33,228
Why are you standing here?
Come inside.

313
00:31:33,305 --> 00:31:35,899
Forget it. We are in
a hurry actually.

314
00:31:35,974 --> 00:31:37,965
We had come here to
the Mahim Mosque.

315
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:43,104
Hey, please bring it. - So we
saw your favorite thing there...

316
00:31:43,181 --> 00:31:46,309
Sweets. - You like it
too much, isn't it?

317
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:51,421
Please come inside. - No son. No.

318
00:31:53,091 --> 00:31:54,922
Are you angry? (Reel 4)

319
00:31:54,993 --> 00:31:56,984
Think like that. You
haven't come to...

320
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:58,086
...the settlement since
many days too.

321
00:31:58,163 --> 00:31:59,994
Okay. I will come
to the settlement...

322
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:02,931
...very soon and trouble all of you.

323
00:32:03,001 --> 00:32:05,094
We will wait for that.

324
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:08,939
What does brother do? Sometimes,
I myself don't understand it.

325
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:12,101
What will you understand? I'm
working since sixteen years...

326
00:32:12,177 --> 00:32:14,941
...and even I haven't understood
it yet. - What do you mean?

327
00:32:15,013 --> 00:32:17,948
Take, eat this. One day,
brother got a call.

328
00:32:18,116 --> 00:32:20,107
And he came to know
that Sachin had...

329
00:32:20,185 --> 00:32:22,449
...taken a contract on
brother and uncle.

330
00:32:22,621 --> 00:32:24,350
As soon as we got
this information...

331
00:32:24,456 --> 00:32:26,447
...I and Anees left
along with brother.

332
00:32:32,631 --> 00:32:35,623
We will have to send Arjun
and his father as coffins.

333
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:37,966
Or else, he will create
many problems for us.

334
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:48,143
It will be done. His work
will be done. - Kaushalya?

335
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:01,457
Come here. - Hey, Sachin, you!
- What are you doing here?

336
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:03,517
Didn't I tell you, that I was
coming to mother's place?

337
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:05,995
Go from here now. - Hey, let
me take the materials first.

338
00:33:06,064 --> 00:33:08,157
I've told you so many times, Why
do you roam around with goods?

339
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,064
My mother! Go away from here now.

340
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:19,268
What? - Who are these people?

341
00:33:19,344 --> 00:33:21,608
How are you concerned
with that? You go home.

342
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:06,649
Let him go! - Kaushalya!
Hey she is pregnant!

343
00:34:06,725 --> 00:34:11,219
Arjun, let her go. Hey Arjun,
this is our matter

344
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:13,457
Don't put a woman
between that. - No.

345
00:34:13,631 --> 00:34:15,724
Pawan, let go of his wife.

346
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,791
Brother, you finish him
off first, brother.

347
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:21,135
Pawan. - This wretch
had come to kill you.

348
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,263
Now you kill him first.

349
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,740
We don't have any concern
with her. Let her go.

350
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:26,800
Brother, I told you, kill him!

351
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:34,081
Didn't I tell you to let go of her?
- No brother. Kill him first.

352
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:38,420
I won't kill him. Let her go. - No
brother kill him. - Let her go!

353
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:39,815
Kaushalya!

354
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:54,838
Hey! What are you doing?
Brother, he is our man!

355
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:08,442
What are you doing? He is our man.

356
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:14,791
Do you know what happened of
him after that? - Whose?

357
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,296
The one whom brother hit. He
was in a coma for three days.

358
00:35:19,464 --> 00:35:22,126
And then he died. - Hey, Shetty
you have started again?

359
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,632
What is going on around there?
- Brother has come.

360
00:35:26,304 --> 00:35:27,794
There isn't any cheating
going on, isn't it?

361
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,806
No brother, please play.

362
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:42,209
Anees, Shetty, what was
going on around here?

363
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,811
Nothing, brother, nothing.
- Nothing, brother.

364
00:35:44,889 --> 00:35:46,880
Ok, brother, I will leave now. I've
got college tomorrow, isn't it?

365
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:55,891
I will leave now.
- I will leave too.

366
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:25,703
Karan has...

367
00:39:34,452 --> 00:39:36,386
Hey, I'm seeing it since
too long okay.

368
00:39:37,655 --> 00:39:40,886
If I lose my senses, you'll
have to pay for it, okay?

369
00:39:53,571 --> 00:39:55,562
Hey, have you gone crazy?
What are you doing?

370
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:57,807
Saahil, have you gone crazy?
We will be rusticated.

371
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,137
He has abused Bindiya!

372
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,405
I understand, but control
yourself right now.

373
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:03,071
We are roadside people,
we are studying here.

374
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:05,411
It is our good fate. Sanju.
Think about Sanju, Saahil.

375
00:40:19,163 --> 00:40:21,427
Think about it and
answer. Whether...

376
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,432
...you have come to play,
or to fight.

377
00:40:40,118 --> 00:40:41,449
Come.

378
00:40:56,534 --> 00:40:57,558
For what?

379
00:41:02,006 --> 00:41:04,474
Actually, it was my mistake. - No,
you did the right thing.

380
00:41:04,542 --> 00:41:06,476
He should have been hit.

381
00:41:06,644 --> 00:41:08,635
And if Karan and his friends
won't have been here today...

382
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:10,476
...I would have been hit too.

383
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:15,078
Would you have been happy
then too? - That's not the thing.

384
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:27,822
You started it, didn't you?
Whatever you did, I liked it.

385
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:35,500
Karan has won the match, therefore...

386
00:41:35,673 --> 00:41:37,903
...brother has organized
a party tonight.

387
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:39,670
You will come, won't you?

388
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:44,011
Karan has won the match, brother...

389
00:41:44,081 --> 00:41:47,517
...has organized the party.
Why should I come then?

390
00:41:48,753 --> 00:41:50,744
For my sake.

391
00:42:15,613 --> 00:42:17,877
Hey, I wanted to ask
you something. - Yes.

392
00:42:18,816 --> 00:42:21,546
The party that is to be
held by you tonight...

393
00:42:22,286 --> 00:42:26,279
My party? - Okay, the party which
we are holding tonight...

394
00:42:26,357 --> 00:42:30,555
...I wish to call some
of my friends there.

395
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:48,907
Where is Bindiya?

396
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,914
I would show that wretch! I
wouldn't leave him at all.

397
00:42:54,986 --> 00:42:57,580
See, he has become a bald man
too. What are you saying?

398
00:43:10,668 --> 00:43:12,260
Seems to be, Karan.

399
00:43:23,781 --> 00:43:24,805
Come.

400
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:41,129
' Eras have accumulated in
this one single moment.'

401
00:43:41,699 --> 00:43:47,638
' I started to see peace in this
movement of the world.'

402
00:43:59,984 --> 00:44:08,323
' If only I would get this moment.'

403
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:17,666
' Me too... in this moment...
in this moment... '

404
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:29,677
'Are you asking in love or
with pride? - With pride.'

405
00:44:31,749 --> 00:44:43,684
' Eras! Eras! Eras! '

406
00:45:08,219 --> 00:45:14,715
' Hey, whose shadow exists in
the mirror of these eyes? '

407
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:20,230
' It comes hiding, just
like the moon.'

408
00:45:20,798 --> 00:45:26,737
'The boat of love calls out to
meet, it is the river of romance.'

409
00:45:26,804 --> 00:45:30,797
'Why does this shyness
stop us, like this? '

410
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:37,747
' People have always drowned
in these waves.'

411
00:45:37,815 --> 00:45:45,813
' Let us survive, drowning
at the shore, my friend.'

412
00:46:59,563 --> 00:47:05,331
'The eyes have found laughter,
the mouth is silent though.'

413
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:11,339
' Please excuse me, I can't tell
my heartfelt feelings here.'

414
00:47:11,509 --> 00:47:17,846
'There are always the secrets
of loyalty between two hearts.'

415
00:47:17,915 --> 00:47:23,854
' If I say it, what love would
be left in the eyes? '

416
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:29,860
' May the eyes be drowned in
the silence of shyness...

417
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:33,863
...may eras pass like this."

418
00:47:33,931 --> 00:47:37,867
' Eras... eras... '

419
00:49:25,142 --> 00:49:28,134
Look after yourself from
now on, okay? - Okay.

420
00:49:29,313 --> 00:49:33,147
Greetings. - Greetings -
How are you? - I am fine.

421
00:49:35,152 --> 00:49:37,143
Sharda aunty, please tell him.
I will stop talking to him...

422
00:49:37,221 --> 00:49:39,212
...if he doesn't take
the medicines on time.

423
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,985
Please don't get angry.

424
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:44,653
Hey, you shop of bones, do you
feelthe chill? Take this shawl.

425
00:49:45,062 --> 00:49:48,498
Forget his chill or warmth,
how is your brother's mood?

426
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:49,589
Cold or hot?

427
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:53,161
Brother is in hot mood
for all other people...

428
00:49:53,237 --> 00:49:56,331
...but he is very cool for you...

429
00:50:00,511 --> 00:50:02,502
Distribute this amongst everyone,
okay? - Yes, brother.

430
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:08,347
Hey, Anees, listen. - Ok, brother,
I will leave. I've got college.

431
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:15,350
Brother, we will leave for the
college too. All the work is done.

432
00:50:18,095 --> 00:50:19,687
Use this at least.

433
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:24,357
Brother, Karan has arrived.
- I know that.

434
00:50:34,211 --> 00:50:36,372
Karan, where were you?

435
00:50:37,114 --> 00:50:39,548
Brother I drank a bit more
in yesterday's party.

436
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:41,646
I had a hangover.

437
00:50:45,222 --> 00:50:53,561
Go and enjoy, help everyone but
be in a limit, understood? - Yes.

438
00:51:01,238 --> 00:51:06,073
Brother, Karan just told that he
had drunk too much last night...

439
00:51:06,143 --> 00:51:08,407
...and that's why he
was late, even then...

440
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:10,071
...you didn't tell him any thing.?

441
00:51:10,147 --> 00:51:12,138
What should I have told to him...

442
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:14,474
...he told me the truth
and nowadays...

443
00:51:14,551 --> 00:51:17,247
...the boys are telling something
and doing something...

444
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:19,681
...lf I will try to...

445
00:51:19,757 --> 00:51:22,089
...stop him then he will
hide things from me...

446
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:26,255
...and tell lies which I won't
be able to tolerate.

447
00:51:27,598 --> 00:51:29,156
Hey, coward, why didn't
you come inside?

448
00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:31,591
Should I have had come inside
and heard brother's scolding?

449
00:51:32,169 --> 00:51:34,763
See, Ronnie, everything should
be told clearly to brother.

450
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:41,270
I think that you should tell Bindiya
the truth in clear words too.

451
00:51:41,345 --> 00:51:44,178
What should I tell her?

452
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:48,117
Just that you love her.

453
00:51:49,186 --> 00:51:51,279
I will tell her, but
at the right time.

454
00:51:52,189 --> 00:51:55,181
But when? Tell her quickly,
otherwise she'll go crazy.

455
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:09,636
She has come. - Who told you to
drink so much at night?

456
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:16,142
Oh! God, she is coming upstairs.

457
00:52:16,213 --> 00:52:23,142
Saahil, I am calling you from
since you are not listening?

458
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:26,653
I was listening to the disc man.
- You were listening to the discman!

459
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:31,484
Okay, you liar. You had kept
it hidden it from me.

460
00:52:31,562 --> 00:52:33,154
You didn't tell me that...

461
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:37,164
This is not generally my habit...

462
00:52:37,234 --> 00:52:39,828
This is not your habit, but
sometimes you dance so good

463
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,231
Yes Yes what did you think?

464
00:52:46,243 --> 00:52:50,839
Nothing Bindiya, anyway,
thanks for the party.

465
00:52:50,914 --> 00:52:54,680
Superb, wasn't it? Brother
had arranged it, for Karan.

466
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:57,185
And Karan's suit, that was
good too, wasn't it?

467
00:52:57,254 --> 00:53:00,189
I had designed it. Wasn't
he looking smart?

468
00:53:03,527 --> 00:53:05,688
Oh! Please listen for a moment.

469
00:53:05,762 --> 00:53:08,196
What I wanted to say,
and what did I say?

470
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:10,197
Karan is like this since
the beginning.

471
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:16,865
But along with every one,
you stunned me too.

472
00:53:20,277 --> 00:53:26,273
You dance so well, you sing so
well. You play basketball too.

473
00:53:26,884 --> 00:53:30,376
And you didn't tell anyone,
not me too.

474
00:53:30,954 --> 00:53:34,720
You know everything about me.
You steal glances at me.

475
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:36,224
If someone says something to me...

476
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:41,230
...you shriek and start fighting
too. Why do like this, Saahil?

477
00:53:54,411 --> 00:53:57,903
Actually. - See, you
get tongue tied.

478
00:53:57,981 --> 00:53:59,573
Are you waiting for someone?

479
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:02,915
I am waiting for that time.
- That's enough.

480
00:54:02,986 --> 00:54:06,922
The time will come and go and
you will just keep waiting.

481
00:54:28,612 --> 00:54:31,274
'The monsoon has brought a message...

482
00:54:31,348 --> 00:54:34,283
...may we be bound to each other.'

483
00:54:34,451 --> 00:54:41,448
' May the rain of happiness
fall on us.'

484
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:45,622
'The breeze too started
to speak, may...

485
00:54:45,696 --> 00:54:48,631
...your marriage procession
be decorated.'

486
00:54:48,699 --> 00:54:54,638
' May the procession move like
the movement of the moon.'

487
00:54:56,373 --> 00:55:01,902
' I wish to attach
feathers and fly.'

488
00:55:02,379 --> 00:55:07,316
' Become a cloud and
touch the very sky.'

489
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:16,325
'The wind of the
rain has spoken... '

490
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:19,385
'... it has taken
away my sleep now.'

491
00:55:19,463 --> 00:55:25,925
'A dream has awakened
in my awakened eyes.'

492
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:30,339
' My mind dances too,
it says subtly...

493
00:55:30,407 --> 00:55:40,339
'... in this strange world, there
is some one close to me.'

494
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:28,397
'At the sea shore,
under the shadow...

495
00:56:28,465 --> 00:56:34,404
'... of some mountain
a house is seen.'

496
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:40,410
'Till the time I'm alive, I
would stay in your heart.'

497
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:45,414
'That's my house! '

498
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:50,579
'Your words are as innocent
as the aroma of the flowers.'

499
00:56:50,654 --> 00:56:58,425
' I bloomed, the whole
world turned aromatic.'

500
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,491
Brother, please have a
look at the documents...

501
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:07,496
...given to us by the
lawyer. We had...

502
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:09,156
...so much trouble in
taking out this file.

503
00:58:17,674 --> 00:58:20,507
What happened about that
property of Delhi?

504
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:22,670
What about that? It
has been settled.

505
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:31,520
And yes, Anees, what about
Bindiya's dad's property?

506
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:33,681
That will be decided in
a couple of days too.

507
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:37,022
You know that I don't want any
laxity in Bindiya's matters.

508
00:58:52,609 --> 00:58:53,633
Hey!

509
00:58:55,278 --> 00:58:59,214
You wait here brother. We
will see, come Shetty

510
00:59:05,622 --> 00:59:07,112
How do these people drive?

511
00:59:07,624 --> 00:59:09,615
You will die if you
will drive like this.

512
00:59:09,893 --> 00:59:10,951
Are you dead?

513
00:59:11,027 --> 00:59:14,554
Anees, is he ok?

514
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:17,566
Yes brother he is ok. The boys
will take or everything else.

515
00:59:17,634 --> 00:59:18,726
Ok.

516
00:59:19,636 --> 00:59:22,070
Shetty, tell the boys to reach
Him to the hospital.

517
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:24,573
Yes, I will reach him
to the hospital.

518
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:26,575
And we will call Inspector
Kadam too.

519
00:59:26,643 --> 00:59:29,111
Yes, call him up. He will
look after this matter.

520
01:00:21,698 --> 01:00:25,634
Brother Anees, who is this?
- Karan, it's nothing.

521
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:38,807
Let it be. It's nothing. Leave it.

522
01:01:01,004 --> 01:01:02,335
Brother, who is this?

523
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:06,934
What happened?

524
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:11,009
Anees brother and Shetty aren't
telling me anything.

525
01:01:11,081 --> 01:01:12,173
Are they hiding something?

526
01:01:12,248 --> 01:01:16,685
No. He works in our mill.
He committed a small theft.

527
01:01:16,753 --> 01:01:20,849
He is caught now. - Theft?
- Yes, theft.

528
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:26,761
You fool, you should asked
brother, you'd get it.

529
01:01:29,032 --> 01:01:35,699
Okay, I will leave now.
You people too!

530
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:41,774
Anees, start the car.

531
01:01:42,779 --> 01:01:44,713
How many times have I told you!

532
01:01:47,784 --> 01:01:49,877
You'll be killed! Why
don't you understand?

533
01:01:49,953 --> 01:01:52,114
Now that you've done it,
don't get tensed.

534
01:01:52,188 --> 01:01:53,712
I'm there. C'mon!

535
01:02:01,064 --> 01:02:05,125
He's my brother. You tell
me. Tell me what to do.

536
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:08,728
We can talk it out. We'll
settle it. Tell me.

537
01:02:08,805 --> 01:02:10,796
You tell me, what's there to
settle. We'll talk it out.

538
01:02:16,813 --> 01:02:20,749
Look! Listen to me! All this
happens. It's business.

539
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:23,251
You've shown mercy, earlier too.
Had it been something important...

540
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:25,753
...then I would've agreed
to you. Forgive him!

541
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:40,826
Had it been regarding me,
then it was alright.

542
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:48,277
12 years ago, you had
taken money to kill me.

543
01:02:51,281 --> 01:02:52,942
I had forgiven you.

544
01:02:55,952 --> 01:03:02,448
Today, your brother has taken
money to kill my brother.

545
01:03:05,862 --> 01:03:07,853
I can't forgive him.

546
01:03:07,931 --> 01:03:13,130
He's my brother! - Sit down!

547
01:03:13,203 --> 01:03:16,969
Arjun, look! Don't kill him!

548
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:20,968
He's my brother!
Have you gone mad!

549
01:03:21,978 --> 01:03:25,414
What you are doing, pal! Don't
kill him! He's my brother!

550
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:38,324
Look, let me take him. - Sit down!

551
01:03:39,229 --> 01:03:42,892
I told you, it was regarding
me. Let me take him away.

552
01:03:42,966 --> 01:03:45,161
I know that all this
was your plan.

553
01:03:46,903 --> 01:03:48,996
Only you can do
such a lowly thing.

554
01:03:50,006 --> 01:03:54,841
Only if I had shot a bullet
through your head.

555
01:03:54,911 --> 01:03:57,903
I'll do whatever you say. But
let me, take away my brother.

556
01:03:57,981 --> 01:04:01,849
Your brother! That too, this
fellow? - We'll settle everything.

557
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:04,250
He took money to kill my brother?

558
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,185
My brother! - Let him go.

559
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:09,919
My innocent brother, who has
nothing to do with all this?

560
01:04:09,993 --> 01:04:13,190
You took money to kill my brother!

561
01:04:15,265 --> 01:04:17,256
You took money to kill my brother!

562
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:19,868
You'll kill my brother!

563
01:04:27,944 --> 01:04:31,038
No one can even dare to
look at my brother!

564
01:04:47,964 --> 01:04:50,057
Karan, I've to talk to
you about something.

565
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:51,894
About what?

566
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:54,459
Do you know Saahil?
- Yes. The one who...

567
01:04:54,537 --> 01:04:55,902
...came to the party with Bindiya?

568
01:04:55,972 --> 01:05:01,239
Yes. That rascal! I had a doubt
on him from that day, itself!

569
01:05:01,978 --> 01:05:03,969
When you weren't coming
to the college...

570
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,913
...then that fellow was being
too close to Bindiya.

571
01:05:06,983 --> 01:05:09,417
He was flying too high! Karan,
I was waiting for you...

572
01:05:09,485 --> 01:05:11,646
...or else, by now, I would've...

573
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:15,082
Forget it, pal.

574
01:05:57,033 --> 01:05:59,695
Karan.
- Who doesn't know you?

575
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:08,978
Even then... - You were too
keen to win, isn't it?

576
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:16,979
You're talking about that party,
isnt' it? - We all were drunk.

577
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,653
Whatever happened after that, what's
there to win or lose in that?

578
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,994
Good. - I learnt to win from you.

579
01:06:30,066 --> 01:06:31,328
You talk very nicely.

580
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:37,337
Let us know what's written in that.
- What?

581
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:43,009
What's there in this card?
Any love letter?

582
01:06:47,083 --> 01:06:49,074
You made friends with us now,
and you forgot it to soon!

583
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:50,512
Ronnie, my card...

584
01:06:54,757 --> 01:06:59,751
You are our friend, isn't it?
- Ronnie is right.

585
01:07:12,108 --> 01:07:15,373
Ok. I'm showing it to you
for the sake of friendship.

586
01:07:17,213 --> 01:07:19,374
Look, Saahil. If this
remains between...

587
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:21,440
...you and Karan, then it's alright.

588
01:07:22,552 --> 01:07:25,715
Why don't we share this love
story of yours with everyone?

589
01:07:25,788 --> 01:07:28,052
Everyone should know of it.

590
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:35,721
I want to share something
with you all.

591
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:37,060
Do you want to know what?

592
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:43,064
He's in love with someone.

593
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:49,077
And he has brought a card
for the one whom he loves.

594
01:07:49,145 --> 01:07:53,582
Ronnie, no! - And we'll see,
what's written in that card.

595
01:07:53,649 --> 01:07:56,413
Karan will read it out to you.

596
01:08:02,158 --> 01:08:03,420
We're all waiting.

597
01:08:50,206 --> 01:08:51,298
Bindiya!

598
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:08,480
Did you listen to this silence?
There's an echo, even in this...

599
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:11,550
...silence, which only
you can listen to.

600
01:09:12,228 --> 01:09:18,167
Don't let it go unheard. Because
if I make you hear it...

601
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:20,492
...then you won't be
able to tolerate it.

602
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:50,256
I've just torn the card
now, understand!

603
01:09:52,268 --> 01:09:56,204
Because the next time, I
won't be able to bear it.

604
01:10:07,283 --> 01:10:10,480
He was Karan, that's why he
spared you. But I'm Ronnie.

605
01:10:12,288 --> 01:10:14,279
Ronnie, what're you doing!

606
01:10:15,892 --> 01:10:19,555
Hero, look here. If you talk
to Bindiya the next time...

607
01:10:19,629 --> 01:10:21,620
...then I'll use my knuckles to
talk to you, and not my tongue.

608
01:10:23,299 --> 01:10:26,234
Whom are you staring at? Do you
think of yourself as a hero...

609
01:10:26,302 --> 01:10:28,293
...on wearing this cheap shirt?

610
01:10:29,305 --> 01:10:34,402
What can be its cost? 100? 50?
Is it a designer one? You!

611
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:53,480
But why did Karan react like that?

612
01:11:56,392 --> 01:11:58,326
And yes, here's that card...

613
01:12:08,404 --> 01:12:12,397
Take. You can sit and talk.
I'm going to Saahil.

614
01:12:14,410 --> 01:12:15,502
Where's Saahil?

615
01:12:22,418 --> 01:12:25,945
What happened? Who hit him?

616
01:12:27,423 --> 01:12:29,687
Someone call the doctor!
- Someone call the doctor!

617
01:12:30,426 --> 01:12:34,021
I'm calling the doctor. Hurry up!

618
01:12:38,434 --> 01:12:45,363
Who hit Saahil? Who hit him!

619
01:12:48,778 --> 01:12:54,375
Move aside. - Nothing
should happen to Sahil.

620
01:12:57,553 --> 01:13:03,890
Brij, who hit Saahil?
- No... nothing.

621
01:13:03,959 --> 01:13:05,392
What nothing?

622
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:06,723
Nothing. In college...

623
01:13:06,796 --> 01:13:09,390
What happened in college?
- Some guys...

624
01:13:09,465 --> 01:13:11,558
Who were those guys?

625
01:13:11,634 --> 01:13:16,401
Those guys...
- Sanju! - Move aside!

626
01:13:20,476 --> 01:13:22,808
The world says that everyone
should be like Karan.

627
01:13:29,752 --> 01:13:31,413
Wear this jacket of mine.

628
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:38,753
Sit here.

629
01:14:54,837 --> 01:14:55,895
Who's that!

630
01:16:21,657 --> 01:16:23,648
Hey! You've to stand and watch it.

631
01:16:23,726 --> 01:16:25,921
No one should flee from
here. Come over here!

632
01:16:30,666 --> 01:16:32,657
No one should go from here!

633
01:16:33,269 --> 01:16:34,600
No one!

634
01:16:35,671 --> 01:16:37,935
No one will shut their
eyes! Hey girl!

635
01:16:38,674 --> 01:16:44,271
Open your eyes. See! You were
having a lot of fun, isn't it?

636
01:16:46,115 --> 01:16:49,607
When this fellow was
hitting Saahil...

637
01:16:49,685 --> 01:16:51,118
...then you were having
a lot of fun, isn't it?

638
01:16:51,687 --> 01:16:55,680
If someone ever dares to look at
Saahil again, then I'll kill him!

639
01:16:58,694 --> 01:16:59,786
I'll kill him!

640
01:17:01,697 --> 01:17:03,961
Move aside!

641
01:17:30,726 --> 01:17:31,988
Please wait!

642
01:17:51,013 --> 01:17:52,241
So much blood has been shed.

643
01:17:56,185 --> 01:17:58,745
You're talking here. And
my brother is there?

644
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:01,847
Please let us do our job.
- You aren't doing your job.

645
01:18:02,024 --> 01:18:05,687
My brother is bleeding so badly.
- See... Look, listen to me.

646
01:18:05,761 --> 01:18:07,854
You haven't extracted
the glass pieces yet!

647
01:18:08,764 --> 01:18:12,029
It must be hurting my brother!
- Look, listen to me...

648
01:18:12,101 --> 01:18:17,869
Listen to me! If something
happens to my brother...

649
01:18:40,062 --> 01:18:48,401
Look, my brother is my life.
Remove the glass.

650
01:18:49,905 --> 01:18:53,898
See, I'll advice you to sit
outside for some time.

651
01:18:55,811 --> 01:18:59,406
You do your work, I'll
sit near my brother.

652
01:19:10,092 --> 01:19:14,825
Get on with the vigil at Andheri,
Kherwadi, Mulund, right away.

653
01:19:14,897 --> 01:19:17,764
You haven't done anything since the
last two hours. Now I will show you!

654
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:20,768
Shows his might! Now the whole
family will be gone!!

655
01:19:20,836 --> 01:19:24,932
Search for him. Send your
men around. I want him. Go.

656
01:19:30,846 --> 01:19:34,282
Sanju! Monty! You went to the
college and had a fight, isn't it?

657
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:35,782
Do you know whose brother
you've thrashed?

658
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:38,843
I know, that Ronnie...
- Arjun Rana's brother.

659
01:19:41,857 --> 01:19:44,451
What are you blabbering?
- I'm not blabbering, Monty!

660
01:19:46,195 --> 01:19:50,188
You've mistakenly bashed up
Karan in place of Ronnie.

661
01:19:51,467 --> 01:19:53,958
He's Arjun Rana's
younger brother...

662
01:19:55,971 --> 01:19:58,804
Sanju, what'll we do now?

663
01:20:01,143 --> 01:20:02,201
We'll see.

664
01:20:07,883 --> 01:20:10,147
Arjun, some inspectors are
Waiting for you outside.

665
01:20:10,219 --> 01:20:13,484
I can't send them in. So you...

666
01:20:20,996 --> 01:20:22,156
Keep informing me.

667
01:20:25,901 --> 01:20:27,391
Brother, the crowd is creating
a lot of problem outside.

668
01:20:27,469 --> 01:20:28,834
You please talk to
the commissioner.

669
01:20:28,904 --> 01:20:32,237
We've sent our men. Where can
he escape to? We'll find him.

670
01:20:32,307 --> 01:20:35,003
We've sent our men to every
area, they'll surely grab them.

671
01:20:35,077 --> 01:20:36,510
All the arrangements
have been made...

672
01:20:36,578 --> 01:20:37,840
...security checks
have been put up...

673
01:20:37,913 --> 01:20:40,108
...everywhere, that boy
can't escape anywhere.

674
01:20:40,182 --> 01:20:43,913
You just talk to him. - Do you
want me to control the crowd?

675
01:20:49,024 --> 01:20:52,357
You want be able to do anything.
I've to do it all.

676
01:21:33,969 --> 01:21:39,236
What happened? - I'm
feeling very scared, brother.

677
01:21:40,976 --> 01:21:46,915
From whom? Your brother
is there. Sit.

678
01:21:51,086 --> 01:21:57,924
Don't feel scared. Look, I
can bear Karan's wounds.

679
01:21:58,260 --> 01:22:01,252
But not your tears.

680
01:22:02,998 --> 01:22:04,932
Everything will become fine.

681
01:22:06,101 --> 01:22:09,434
Here, drink some water.

682
01:22:13,008 --> 01:22:18,002
Now they'll cry. See what
your brother does to them.

683
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:20,014
I'll break their bones.

684
01:22:29,124 --> 01:22:30,955
Brother, I'm feeling
scared of you.

685
01:22:37,032 --> 01:22:38,294
Really, brother.

686
01:22:40,035 --> 01:22:42,026
I'm feeling very scared
of your fury.

687
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:46,631
Many incidents have
happened outside.

688
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:50,972
People are being killed
on false claims.

689
01:22:51,046 --> 01:22:53,981
And yes, there are thousands
of people downstairs...

690
01:22:54,049 --> 01:22:59,146
...who on your indication, won't
maintain the difference...

691
01:23:02,724 --> 01:23:04,988
One day, you had showed a
difference of heaven and earth...

692
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:07,051
...in the gifts that you
gave to Karan and me.

693
01:23:07,396 --> 01:23:08,454
Isn't it?

694
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:12,492
Have those heaven and
earth come together?

695
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:17,061
Those heaven and earth
have come together!

696
01:23:22,344 --> 01:23:25,336
Whatever happened in college,
why did it happen?

697
01:23:26,081 --> 01:23:30,609
Everyone knows that,
except you, brother.

698
01:23:32,087 --> 01:23:40,017
You don't know the truth.
I'm afraid that you may...

699
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:34,743
Look, what are you thinking
now, Arjun?

700
01:24:35,751 --> 01:24:38,083
The face of yours, that you
wanted to hide from Bindiya...

701
01:24:38,153 --> 01:24:40,087
...that very face has brought
lines of worry on the...

702
01:24:40,155 --> 01:24:41,645
...face of an innocent
girl like Bindiya.

703
01:24:42,157 --> 01:24:45,593
You've lost your temper after
a long time, try to control it.

704
01:24:46,161 --> 01:24:49,255
Moreover, a lot of things have
happened, without your orders.

705
01:24:49,431 --> 01:24:52,264
Now, your one indication can cause
a lot of destruction all around.

706
01:24:53,168 --> 01:24:56,604
Stop everything. If you
still don't stop...

707
01:24:56,671 --> 01:24:58,662
...then maybe Bindiya was right...

708
01:24:58,740 --> 01:25:00,503
...the heaven and earth
have come together.

709
01:25:00,575 --> 01:25:03,169
You've changed, Arjun! No!

710
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:11,609
The heaven and the earth
can't come together.

711
01:25:13,288 --> 01:25:16,621
Bindiya, your brother
is still the same.

712
01:25:17,459 --> 01:25:19,620
The heaven and the earth
can't come together.

713
01:25:19,795 --> 01:25:23,788
Similarly, the guilty and the
innocent can't be the same.

714
01:25:29,204 --> 01:25:32,139
Father, you tell me. What
kind of power is this...

715
01:25:32,207 --> 01:25:35,643
...possessing which,
I can't do anything.

716
01:25:35,811 --> 01:25:40,145
Neither can I burn down the city,
nor can I kill the innocent.

717
01:25:40,315 --> 01:25:43,307
Neither can I see my
brother's wounds...

718
01:25:43,385 --> 01:25:46,218
...and nor can I see the
tears in Bindiya's eyes!

719
01:25:48,323 --> 01:25:51,315
But you've made the
laws of this world.

720
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:53,825
And there, the guilty
shouldn't be forgiven.

721
01:25:54,429 --> 01:25:58,000
I'll kill him! Father!
