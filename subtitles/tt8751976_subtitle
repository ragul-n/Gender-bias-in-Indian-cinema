1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,625


3
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:53,125
we're looking at right now.'

4
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:55,375
'This has become a challenge
to the rescue team itself.'

5
00:01:55,417 --> 00:01:56,625
When did you last see, Dev?

6
00:01:56,625 --> 00:01:57,583
Which camp did
you last check-in?

7
00:01:57,583 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm asking about Dev,
tell me where is Dev?

8
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:05,625
'In the process of looking for Dev
Ramalingam, a Tamizh Adventurer

9
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,333
the rescue team is
rushing on a helicopter.'

10
00:02:12,542 --> 00:02:13,208
Copy!

11
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:13,917
Copy!

12
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:14,833
Not able to proceed--

13
00:02:14,875 --> 00:02:16,292
'cause of a troubled line.

14
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,375
-What happened?
-Sir, we can't go further

15
00:02:19,458 --> 00:02:20,958
Alpha:
returning back to base.

16
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,583
Damn!

17
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,208
Sir, the wind is too strong.

18
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:21,583
Meghna!

19
00:03:48,042 --> 00:03:49,042
Samosa!

20
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,000
Damn you Samosa, it's getting
late for the show open the door.

21
00:03:52,042 --> 00:03:53,042
Ah...I'm coming!

22
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:54,208
What the hell are you doing?

23
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,542
Ey---everyone is
waiting for you.

24
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,292
'Nisha is Vicky read yet?'

25
00:03:57,292 --> 00:03:58,417
Ya, he just opened the
door, hold on a sec

26
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,250
Thought of reviewing movies like Blue
Sattai, but it ends up as a complaint--

27
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,375
--at commisioner's office. So I moved
on to speaking about internet videos...

28
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,583
-Ey--enough of rehearsing--
-Do you guys agree?

29
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,000
--how long will you rant the same thing.
Let's go.

30
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:09,000
I had asked for an
apple juice, where's it?

31
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
-What did you ask?
-Apple Juice!

32
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:11,458
-Apple juice is it!?
-Fine, let go--

33
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,125
-at least try something new
today, come on -I'm coming dammit!

34
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:20,833
Woohoo!

35
00:04:21,125 --> 00:04:21,917
Greetings to one and all!

36
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,667
'You haven't been Vicky's
show right, it'll be awesome.'

37
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:26,042
You must be really worn out
working throughout the weekdays

38
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:28,292
just to have a good
laugh during the weekend

39
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:32,417
a very Good Evening to all the humble
souls who have bought tickets to this show.

40
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:34,583
"Vicky Pechu League"
[Vicky Banter League]

41
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,917
Even if we're divided between
wealth, caste and language

42
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,792
there's just one emotion,
which brings us together.

43
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:41,917
What emotion is that?

44
00:04:42,042 --> 00:04:42,708
INDIAN!

45
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,833
Indian-uh!?

46
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:47,625
I'm pretty sure, he's a die hard
fan of Arjun since childhood

47
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,458
That's not it.

48
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,000
only emotion which binds the youngsters
of India together these days is--

49
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,125
--ENGINEERING!

50
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,417
Woohoo!

51
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:58,125
The applause is strong, I can't
help but shoot this question

52
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,958
is there a soul who hasn't
pursued Engineering?

53
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:00,833
Brother!

54
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,500
Intelli-Head!

55
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:04,833
You're not fit to be
a Tamizhan, buddy.

56
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,500
What did you even pursue,
if not Engineering?

57
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,292
Hotel Management!

58
00:05:07,292 --> 00:05:08,917
Hotel Management

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,625
So you were drawn to
"on the job training"--

60
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:12,792
you rock, buddy!

61
00:05:13,042 --> 00:05:15,083
While I was wondering about
the topic for the day--

62
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:18,417
--there's no use to banter
on GST, Petrol Price

63
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,625
in no ways this will elevate
our standard of living

64
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,250
or am I going to become
a Chief Minister?

65
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:25,625
So, I'm going to tell
you guys a short story

66
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:30,125
A story about a person, who I
never wished to meet in life.

67
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,625
His name is,
Dev Ramalingam!

68
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,417
'I met him at a
very strange place

69
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:37,042
and he's a unique person.'

70
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:39,708
'Kids are bound to cry on
the first day of the school

71
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:42,792
but he came in smiling
and wiped our tears.'

72
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,708
'When we thought becoming
his friends, we came to know

73
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,792
our birthdays were
on the same date.'

74
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:49,583
'Obviously, we
became best friends.'

75
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,125
'Do you know what he says, if
we ask to copy his homework?'

76
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:55,625
You're my friend,
but I can't do this.

77
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:57,792
Homework should be
done on your own

78
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,250
it's not something you can copy.

79
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:02,333
'Before we could
cut ties with him--

80
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:05,250
--spur of the moment, he'll
do something and impress us.'

81
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:07,792
Ey---didn't you
finish your homework?

82
00:06:07,792 --> 00:06:09,500
I finished homework for my sake

83
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:10,792
but got chucked
out for you guys.

84
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:12,500
'Who is he dude?
Fine let that go.'

85
00:06:12,542 --> 00:06:15,500
'It's always fun being around
him doing naughty stuff--

86
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,208
--being a girl, she'll
getaway with things

87
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,250
but I'll get tangled
in his heroism antics.'

88
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,917
Madam, your daughter doesn't
seem to finish her homework

89
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,250
did you even check with her?

90
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:27,417
Sorry Sir, I'll make
sure to keep a tab on it.

91
00:06:27,417 --> 00:06:29,125
I totally understand
your problem, Menaka

92
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:32,250
it's really hard to
be a single mother.

93
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:35,000
What I'm trying to say is--

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,875
Sir!

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,292
Men right?
We're here for her.

96
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:39,583
Am I right, Mom?

97
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,500
'Damn it, dude. Why do you have
to churn a punch line to him?'

98
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,792
'Thought will try and
move away from there'

99
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:46,542
'He won't let me go'

100
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:48,792
'Cause of him, I used to
get screwed royally by him.'

101
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,917
That's when I learned a truth--

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
cat and tiger may look the
same when they're young

103
00:06:54,042 --> 00:06:56,000
but the issue lies
when they grow up.

104
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,958
'NCC, SCOUT, Running, Trekking

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,292
he'll make me do everything
to shed the calories.'

106
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:03,208
I thought I'll get rid
of him after school

107
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,542
but he ended up in the
same Department at college.

108
00:07:05,542 --> 00:07:06,625
'Lord save me'

109
00:07:06,667 --> 00:07:09,833
'I grew up being Dev's
friend, and lost my identity

110
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,583
people were not even
aware of my name.'

111
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:14,125
'They used to troll me
"Topper's friend Joker".

112
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,625
It'll be embarrassing.'

113
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,625
Finally thought if I'll
get rid of by doing a job

114
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:20,250
unfortunately I did Engineering,
getting a job was tough.

115
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,958
Three years passed
just looking for a job.

116
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,042
'But he used to make money by going
on a adventure and photography

117
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,458
-'But at my own sweet shop--
-Useless!

118
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,750
I was not even fit to
knead the dough for Samosa'

119
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:38,292
'That's when God blessed me, by sending
MBA application to study abroad.'

120
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,375
Dad, people are not
diabetic abroad.

121
00:07:41,542 --> 00:07:42,917
If I pursue higher
education there--

122
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:46,458
--they'll grant us loan to
open our franchise out there.

123
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:50,375
Yayy!

124
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:53,375
'For the first time, I managed
to get away from his clutches

125
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:58,458
Mr.Vignesh Perumal, my name was
announced on the last call for boarding'

126
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,000
But when I arrived there--

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,583
--I was shell-shocked!

128
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,833
The person who I was
running away from--

129
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:06,042
--he arrived there too

130
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:08,458
and received me
yelling "Surprise!".

131
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:11,250
It was him who sent
that application.

132
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,750
When I heard that--

133
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:16,417
--I realized there's a reaction
in between laughing and crying

134
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,250
'That means, you don't
really like him?'

135
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,875
'Listen, I like him a lot.'

136
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:23,042
'There lies the issue.'

137
00:08:23,042 --> 00:08:24,625
'What kind of issue, brother!?'

138
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:27,625
'Hold your horses, brother.
I've just begun to narrate.'

139
00:08:27,917 --> 00:08:29,792
'Once we were done
with our final exams--

140
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:32,792
--I was drunk and sleeping in
peace, where are you taking me?

141
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,125
Surprise...!

142
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,958
I'm getting impatient,
are we there yet?

143
00:08:37,042 --> 00:08:39,000
Start a countdown--

144
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:39,750
--we'll be there.

145
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:41,417
Aa..ah..One!

146
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:42,833
Damn it, do a proper count

147
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:46,042
10, 9, 8, 7, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1...

148
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:48,125
Ey--why are you holding me back?

149
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,375
Happy Birthday, Buddy!

150
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:52,542
Happy Birthday, Da!

151
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,208
-Happy Birthday, Da!
-Happy Birthday, Di!

152
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:55,792
Happy Birthday, Di...!

153
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,292
-Aye...
-Enjoy!

154
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,125
Oh no....!!!

155
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,792
Buddy, I don't
have guts to do it

156
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:04,875
you push me over.

157
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:06,125
Get lost!

158
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:57,750
Ey---get up damn it.

159
00:09:57,833 --> 00:09:59,917
Was it exhilarating?

160
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:01,958
-We just started...
-Ey, our ties..

161
00:10:01,958 --> 00:10:03,125
...are no more to cherish.

162
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:05,250
Throw that blanket and
get lost from here.

163
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,125
Don't laugh, damn it.

164
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,000
Hey!

165
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,708
The bears will be
here, let's move.

166
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,375
Those bears are
way better than you

167
00:10:11,417 --> 00:10:12,667
I rather live with the bears

168
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,208
-for God sake, get lost from here.
-Here, take this

169
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:15,333
-Bloody, Samosa get up
-Ey--

170
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,792
--I really don't get you

171
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:18,458
You go trekking,
when you're happy

172
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,000
so do you when you're sad too.

173
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:22,375
-Even you drink on both the occasions
-Bonjour!

174
00:10:22,417 --> 00:10:23,667
-We never ask...
-I won't even if you do

175
00:10:23,667 --> 00:10:24,292
Bonjour!

176
00:10:24,292 --> 00:10:25,583
Did you say, Minjur?

177
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,250
Oh, wow!

178
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,750
My birthday gift has arrived.

179
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,583
It's time to impress her.

180
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,625
I'm a Complan Boy!

181
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:36,792
-262..!
-Keep it coming

182
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,500
...263
-Hello!

183
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,542
-295
-Do you have water?

184
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:43,000
-Yes!
-Samosa, it's embarrassing

185
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,583
-Get up, damn it.
-Get lost!

186
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:45,792
Thank you!

187
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:46,375
Ey..!

188
00:10:46,417 --> 00:10:48,250
-What does she want?
-She was asking for water

189
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:50,917
Was she asking for
water all this while?

190
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:53,500
Mmmm, she's asking
to tag along with us.

191
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:55,375
What is our man, saying though?

192
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:56,917
he must've refused
to take her along.

193
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:59,000
-Pretty much...
-Mmmm!

194
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,708
Who is he to refuse--

195
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,125
-I'll take her along
-Ey...!

196
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,333
-you're getting yourself into #MeToo
-Hello Baby!

197
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,708
-I'll take you, please wait.
-He's gone mad.

198
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,583
Ask him to drive.

199
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,417
-Eh!
-She's coming with me

200
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,542
-Ey--I thought we cut ties
-Point!

201
00:11:13,542 --> 00:11:14,458
but now he's asking me to drive

202
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,333
Poor thing she's relying on us,
and has no clothes to change

203
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,125
how can we leave her in despair.

204
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:20,667
Ask him to drive.

205
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:22,375
Fine, he's eager.
Come on buddy.

206
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,833
-Fine, come on.
-I love you!

207
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:26,125
Why are you a floozy?

208
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,792

about this place?'

-Come on!

00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:54,042
Ok!

268
00:15:54,125 --> 00:15:56,375
Buddy, don't be drinking too much.
Come on.

269
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,625
Have you heard of "Milky Way"?

270
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,125
-That's the one
-Wow!

271
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:06,000
-Damn, it's beautiful.
-Yeah!

272
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,542
But all the stars look alike.

273
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,125
It's not all the same.

274
00:16:10,458 --> 00:16:13,500
Puravi, Adupu, Yeral there are
a total of twenty seven kind.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,458
Mmmm...!

276
00:16:24,917 --> 00:16:26,375
Is he still upset?

277
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:28,417
I think so.

278
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:30,250
Wait, I'll check on him.

279
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,000
Ey---enough with the booze.

280
00:16:36,417 --> 00:16:37,625
Ey--let go damn it.

281
00:16:38,542 --> 00:16:40,750
You both have hexed me.

282
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,500
Ey--don't be ranting.

283
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,792
I'm not ranting, I'm
telling the truth.

284
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:48,250
You have your Mom, who'll
do anything for you.

285
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,375
And his Dad, is the coolest.

286
00:16:50,417 --> 00:16:53,375
But I have no one who
would do something for me.

287
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,208
Even without studying,
you guys score good.

288
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:58,125
But me, in spite of
studying can't score.

289
00:16:58,208 --> 00:16:59,500
Don't be an idiot.

290
00:16:59,542 --> 00:17:00,542
I am an idiot!

291
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,208
That's the reason, you
guys let me tag along.

292
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,125
'Cause when I'm around,
you guys look the best.

293
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:08,375
'Cause I'm dark, fat
and fit for nothing.

294
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:09,833
Ridiculous!

295
00:17:09,833 --> 00:17:12,083
You've been whining all along

296
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,000
get down...get down, damn it.

297
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:15,875
-Let go off me
-Come over here

298
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,500
Let go damn it, he's the
reason for everything

299
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,583
What's your problem now?

300
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:22,500
I don't like this way of living

301
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,667
Like what?

302
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,583
Lurking around places

303
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:29,875
without any fear or seriousness.
I can't be like how you are.

304
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,458
Did I ever ask you to follow me?

305
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,542
You didn't!

306
00:17:33,583 --> 00:17:34,750
Fine--

307
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,375
--how do you want
to heed your life?

308
00:17:36,542 --> 00:17:39,375
A respectful job

309
00:17:39,375 --> 00:17:41,125
which pays really well

310
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,333
party during the weekends

311
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:45,583
I wanna settle down
with a beautiful wife.

312
00:17:46,042 --> 00:17:47,958
That's great buddy, your
way seems to be unique.

313
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:52,542
Oh, so my dreams
are a joke to you.

314
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,042
Damn sure it's not a joke

315
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:56,458
There are different kinds
of people in the world

316
00:17:56,917 --> 00:17:58,250
whether you like it or not

317
00:17:58,458 --> 00:17:59,708
work at a dead end job

318
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,125
earn and save a ton of money

319
00:18:02,333 --> 00:18:03,750
end up buying
things we don't need

320
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,417
with crude EMI's and GST.

321
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:08,208
This society which
expects you to be

322
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,792
and live a way, is one kind.

323
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,000
Do you see them sitting there?

324
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:13,375
lost in their will.

325
00:18:13,417 --> 00:18:15,958
They're high and looking
for a different world.

326
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,250
They're one kind.

327
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,875
Us humans are born to explore

328
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:22,125
competition, pressure, ego

329
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,708
these things are imposed by the society.
Let's not get tangled.

330
00:18:26,042 --> 00:18:28,875
A job beyond fame and wealth,

331
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:31,125
which let's you be
in peace and joy.

332
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,583
That's the job for you.

333
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,750
You should go looking for it.

334
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:36,417
I have no such desire.

335
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,833
Who said so?

336
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,958
You can turn anything
into a comedy.

337
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,708
There are a million
here to make people cry.

338
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:45,125
You make them laugh.

339
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,792
When you're outraged and
fighting with someone

340
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,500
imagine how angry you'll be,
when you're asked to do comedy.

341
00:18:50,667 --> 00:18:52,833
He preaches a philosophy though

342
00:18:53,042 --> 00:18:54,875
happiness is like wind

343
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:57,125
life, if spread like wings

344
00:18:57,125 --> 00:19:00,125
happiness will grace
you with open arms.

345
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,125
But I understood one thing--

346
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:07,042
--no matter what I do,
I can't get rid of him.

347
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,500
But what if he gets rid of me?

348
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:13,792
A man always bows down to women.

349
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,792
Got it! Got it!

350
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,917
Got it!
Got itttt!!!

351
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,667
If you're there,
get lost damn it.

352
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:23,375
Bloody buffalo, annoying
and disturbing my sleep.

353
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:25,708
Look here--

354
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,833
Wanna experience the life to
fullest, you've to do it right

355
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,125
You're not doing it right

356
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,417
Hey, what's your problem now?

357
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,042
Buddy, you gotta fall in love.

358
00:19:35,042 --> 00:19:38,042
Ey...Samosa! Why are you
so concerned about him?

359
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:40,958
I-I-I-I've been always
concerned about him.

360
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,625
but now is the need
for it to be expressed.

361
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,500
Buddy, love is an
amazing feeling.

362
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,542
Isn't that the other
half of the life?

363
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:50,375
Buddy!

364
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:52,750
I think--

365
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,458
-Ey...
-Hey!

366
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,125
I think he has a point.

367
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,833
Wake up, damn it.

368
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,417
You like adventures

369
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:02,542
love is nothing less
than a adventure.

370
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,042
Thank God, she got the drift.

371
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:06,500
That's fine---

372
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,917
---but I need to
find the right girl.

373
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,208
-We'll cross that bridge when it requires.
-You're correct though

374
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,542
-now let me sleep in peace.
-Oh no she messed it up again

375
00:20:11,542 --> 00:20:13,542
-Ey...wait!
-It won't happen on its own

376
00:20:13,542 --> 00:20:15,542
You've advised yourself,
that seekers are winners

377
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:16,583
we'll have to seek out.

378
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,958
Why are you seeking out for me?

379
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,708
I saw a spark in your eye, when
the word "Love" was mentioned.

380
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,917
Buddy, come on get up.

381
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:22,833
-Hmm!?
-Mmm-hmm!

382
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,083
Idiot!

383
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,083
Stop annoying me.

384
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,500
-Friends are the ones who realize this
-You both have gone mad

385
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:28,125
where are you going?

386
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,125
-We're going to find the ONE for you
-I'm coming too

387
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,833
Let's login to Facebook,
and start hunting

388
00:20:36,125 --> 00:20:37,833
Really!?
Facebook and relationship?

389
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:40,375
Don't be so skeptical

390
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,000
these days info about girls
on Aadhar card is less

391
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,500
compared to the info available
on Facebook and Instagram.

392
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,750
Just send one request

393
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,375
take this

394
00:20:47,417 --> 00:20:48,667
I can't send request
to a stranger

395
00:20:48,667 --> 00:20:50,375
Hey...it'll be thrilling.

396
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,542
-Ya!
-Just shut up.

397
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,833
Buddy---I'm just asking
you to send a request.

398
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,375
She'll accept, if she likes you.

399
00:20:56,417 --> 00:20:57,875
If not she'll reject you.

400
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,125
If she accepts, drop a "Hi"

401
00:20:59,125 --> 00:21:00,583
if rejected, just bid goodbye.

402
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:01,958
If she replies,
then chat with her

403
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,750
-If you like her, then make...
-Ey...!

404
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:05,667
I just went with the flow.

405
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,417
School kids are
nailing it these days.

406
00:21:07,458 --> 00:21:08,875
What's your problem?
Just login, damn it.

407
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:10,417
-Come on do it
-I can't do it.

408
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:13,042
Just wait and watch--

409
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,000
"I love adventure" isn't
that your password?

410
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:15,958
How do you know that?

411
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,750
I'm sure you won't have
"Floozy" as your password

412
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,750
give me my laptop

413
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,708
-Ey--don't fight guys
-Hey, give it back damn it

414
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:21,875
Ey---give it back

415
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:23,333
-I'll thrash you bugger.
-It's gonna break

416
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:24,750
-Let go guys
-Get lost, it's my laptop

417
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:25,625
Ey!
-Stop, dammit!

418
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:26,292
Ey!

419
00:21:26,292 --> 00:21:28,375
Look here, let's
come to a compromise

420
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:30,708
we'll countdown 10-1
among friends suggestion

421
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,000
Whoever is #1

422
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,417
if that girl seems interesting,
then we'll proceed.

423
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:37,333
if not, you should stop
bugging him with this.

424
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,292
Council! I'm on board.
What about him?

425
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:40,250
He's on board too.

426
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:41,958
Ey, now you too are
being ridiculous.

427
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,792
Sounds interesting,
let's give it a try

428
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:47,375
Hey, this feels like I'm being
scrutinized by an astrologer.

429
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:49,917
Ey---let's give it a try.

430
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,375
Ten

431
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:53,542
Nine

432
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:54,708
Eight

433
00:21:54,792 --> 00:21:55,833
Seven

434
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:57,542
-It's full of men profiles
-Six

435
00:21:57,542 --> 00:21:59,042
-gotta hook him up
-Five

436
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,333
-Oh God...Oh god!
-Four

437
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:01,708
-Oh God...Oh god!
-Three

438
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,000
-Oh God...Oh god!
-Two

439
00:22:03,042 --> 00:22:03,958
-Oh God...Oh god!
-ONE!

440
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:07,458
Oh no...there's a
profile for a dog here.

441
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:09,542
Come on buddy,
give me the laptop.

442
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:11,875
I'll message, "Tommy I love you"

443
00:22:12,042 --> 00:22:13,792
Ey---this doesn't count.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,750
-Let's start over.
-He's right.

445
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,250
Just like she said, this is #1

446
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,125
that's it, we're done.
Dot!

447
00:22:18,208 --> 00:22:19,875
Ey---please let's do it.

448
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,625
Dev!
What happened?

449
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,083
What are you looking at?

450
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:47,042
Hey...!
She's so pretty.

451
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,750
She is...so pretty!?

452
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:50,750
-Ya!
-The fish has caught the hook

453
00:22:52,333 --> 00:22:53,500
Meghna...

454
00:22:53,542 --> 00:22:55,000
Padmavati uh!

455
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,458
What's wrong with you?

456
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,042
Nothing much, but the
name sounds weird.

457
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,000
-Oh no!
-Do you feel so?

458
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,750
No, no, no...
Meghna Dev Padmavati

459
00:23:03,792 --> 00:23:05,625
it sounds really classic.

460
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:06,750
congratulations!

461
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,750
First send her a friend request

462
00:23:09,125 --> 00:23:10,250
-Hey...!
-It went...

463
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:42,875
Good Morning!

464
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,083
-Good morning, Ma'am
-Good morning, Deepti

465
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:47,000
What's the agenda for today?

466
00:23:47,042 --> 00:23:48,917
Ma'am, now we have a
product development meeting

467
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:50,667
later at 11am, we have a
meeting with the investors.

468
00:23:51,125 --> 00:23:52,708
-Is Harish here?
-Ya, he's here ma'am.

469
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:53,417
Ok!

470
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:56,250
Morning!

471
00:23:57,792 --> 00:24:00,667
Hey Meghna, sorry couldn't
take calls for past two days.

472
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:01,750
That's fine.

473
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,250
-Morning!
-Good Morning!

474
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,208
Morning!

475
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,375
-Morning...Good Morning!
-Good Morning!

476
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,792
So, let's start

477
00:24:10,875 --> 00:24:12,708
Meghna, there's a lens
box in front of you

478
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,083
wear those lenses and see

479
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,292
Trust me, you'll be surprised.

480
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:32,917
Hereafter to take a picture, you
won't need a camera or a mobile phone

481
00:24:32,958 --> 00:24:36,042
to capture the beautiful
moments without missing on it

482
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,750
this lens will be
more than enough.

483
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,417
Thank you!

484
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:44,792
So, what do you think, Meghna?

485
00:24:44,833 --> 00:24:46,250
Very interesting idea

486
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:48,000
we can make a lot of money.

487
00:24:48,708 --> 00:24:49,583
But let's not do it.

488
00:24:50,458 --> 00:24:51,125
Why?

489
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,583
Many will be affected by this--

490
00:24:53,792 --> 00:24:56,250
--taking pictures or videos
without ones knowledge

491
00:24:56,292 --> 00:24:58,333
and destroying their privacy.

492
00:24:58,375 --> 00:25:00,000
We'll become a tool for that.

493
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,125
Ma'am--what if the same idea as
Hairsh is conceived by someone else?

494
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:05,917
Not just anyone

495
00:25:06,208 --> 00:25:09,250
Even ABC corporation can
launch this product next week

496
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:11,042
possibilities are infinite.

497
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:13,208
Am I right, Harish?

498
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:16,042
Ah---how would I know?

499
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,792
Weren't you there last Saturday?

500
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:20,625
You must be aware.

501
00:25:22,458 --> 00:25:23,792
How much did they offer?

502
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:27,708
Come on tell me, no issues.

503
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:31,708
They offered twice
than I draw here.

504
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:34,542
Good, I think you
should take the offer.

505
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:41,917
Meghna!

506
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,208
You're overreacting

507
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:48,292
getting hurt, by falling
into pit is common sense.

508
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:51,958
it's foolishness to see if you get
hurt after falling into the pit.

509
00:25:52,125 --> 00:25:53,833
I don't wish to be a fool.

510
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:57,667
Your contract will be canceled and the
settlement will reach you by evening.

511
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:58,875
You can leave.

512
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,375
Meghna, I'm the
CTO of this company

513
00:26:02,417 --> 00:26:05,708
no one's skilled enough, to handle
the product launch next week.

514
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,083
I can do it!

515
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,125
You're firing me, 'cause
I went to the interview?

516
00:26:12,625 --> 00:26:14,833
I did, 'cause you
broke my trust.

517
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,625
Shall I give you a good news?

518
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:45,833
It's been six hours,
since he spoke to us.

519
00:26:46,208 --> 00:26:47,042
Look at him--

520
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:49,958
--he's running on the
treadmill confused

521
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,208
I'm off the hook now.

522
00:26:51,917 --> 00:26:52,792
I don't understand.

523
00:26:53,042 --> 00:26:54,500
You won't understand.

524
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,708
This has been my dream for ages.

525
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,250
Hold on, I'll be back.

526
00:26:59,667 --> 00:27:00,917
What's up, buddy!

527
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,417
Looks like she accepted
your friend request.

528
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:05,458
What did you say?

529
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,792
You seemed to be
in a romantic moo--

530
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:09,792
"Ecstatic Panda Dance"

531
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:12,667
Damn it, were you dancing
to this stupid track

532
00:27:12,708 --> 00:27:14,458
Ya, so what?

533
00:27:14,542 --> 00:27:16,083
What's wrong with you?

534
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,292
I went through a lot and
found that girl for you

535
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:20,292
instead of focusing on
her, you're stuck on this

536
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:22,667
Ey, Samosa!
Let it go!

537
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:24,833
He's not interested,
why are you imposing?

538
00:27:25,542 --> 00:27:26,792
Buddy, you're right.

539
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:29,000
That girl is not right for
you, I'll cancel the request.

540
00:27:29,042 --> 00:27:31,042
Why!? Why do we have to
cancel the friend request?

541
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:32,292
-Obviously
-First, give me that iPad.

542
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:34,000
Anyways you're not interested.

543
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:35,167
She hasn't accepted
the request yet.

544
00:27:35,208 --> 00:27:36,875
She hasn't accepted it yet?

545
00:27:36,917 --> 00:27:37,708
Give me that.

546
00:27:40,583 --> 00:27:41,917
Oh God, no!

547
00:27:42,125 --> 00:27:43,875
Ey--she's definitely
not a match for you

548
00:27:43,917 --> 00:27:44,833
Why is that?

549
00:27:44,875 --> 00:27:46,750
She lives in America.

550
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,000
What!?

551
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:50,167
America!?

552
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,042
So what if she lives in America?

553
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:55,958
Oh! So are you going to hop on
with guitar and venture to America?

554
00:27:55,958 --> 00:27:56,958
I'll whack you, damn it.

555
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,292
You won't just take the guitar--

556
00:27:58,292 --> 00:28:00,083
--you'll drag us along too.

557
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:01,250
This won't work out.

558
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,875
Just not that buddy,

559
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,708
this is a fake profile.

560
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,292
This is not how someone looks.

561
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:08,542
They've photoshopped the picture.
Look at the name--

562
00:28:08,667 --> 00:28:10,125
"Meghna Padmavati"

563
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:12,000
The name doesn't have
a good ring to it.

564
00:28:12,167 --> 00:28:13,792
Facebook isn't
working out for you.

565
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,458
-Where's your mobile phone?
-For what?

566
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:16,375
Just give it..

567
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:18,500
I found it.

568
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:20,583
Ey--what are you doing?

569
00:28:20,583 --> 00:28:23,750
Aren't you ashamed peeking
into a guys mobile?

570
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,667
-Get lost
-Get lost, damn it.

571
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:28,333
Give me a smile.

572
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,042
Ah...that's enough!

573
00:28:33,417 --> 00:28:35,000
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok...

574
00:28:35,042 --> 00:28:36,958
-Ey, what are you doing?
-OK!

575
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:38,125
It's tinder, dude.

576
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,875
We'll look for a girl
within 10 kms and hook up

577
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,583
Look here, speed dating
won't work out for me.

578
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:43,417
Cancel that thing.

579
00:28:43,458 --> 00:28:44,667
Have you ever done speed dating.

580
00:28:44,708 --> 00:28:46,250
Have you! Have you!

581
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:48,000
You haven't right?

582
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,250
Thought as much.

583
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:52,542
People are struggling
to get one like

584
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:54,000
lot of women are pinging you.

585
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,958
You're a lucky fellow, damn it.

586
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,250
Chances are, you
might meet your angel.

587
00:28:58,542 --> 00:29:00,125
Come on, let's leave.

588
00:29:00,125 --> 00:29:01,667
-Ey---Ey!
-Come on.

589
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,125
-Keep moving.
-This won't work out.

590
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:05,333
-Just listen...
-Don't think too much, just go

591
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,000
Go! Go!

592
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:08,917
Be quick!

593
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,583
Thank God!

594
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,292
Ey, Samosa! Back home there's
a name for such a behaviour.

595
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:17,000
Ah---it's the same name
back at my native too.

596
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,125
But to make him budge,
I don't mind doing it.

597
00:29:20,917 --> 00:29:21,542
Hi!

598
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,458
See, I don't believe in love--

599
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,125
--that's why I'm on tinder.

600
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:26,750
Love can hurt, you see.

601
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:29,917
Are you ok with casual sex?

602
00:29:40,167 --> 00:29:41,375
-Ey--stop damn it
-Ey--Ey!

603
00:29:41,417 --> 00:29:43,708
Stop right there,
you said it's dating

604
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,167
but it turns out to be mating.

605
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,083
Stop there, damn it

606
00:29:46,125 --> 00:29:47,167
-I'm gonna kill you -I
set you up with 10 girls

607
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,292
but you returned with no play

608
00:29:48,333 --> 00:29:50,208
you won't be spared
for this grave sin

609
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:53,250
Ey---open the bloody door.

610
00:29:53,417 --> 00:29:55,417
-if not I will whack you
-I won't open it

611
00:29:55,458 --> 00:29:56,667
This is not fair

612
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:59,292
If I talk about work,
you stress on adventure

613
00:29:59,542 --> 00:30:02,417
but if I hook you up,
you rant about culture.

614
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,208
Just listen to me closely now--

615
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,417
At present, not only here

616
00:30:05,458 --> 00:30:07,083
even back home,
this is the trend.

617
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:08,292
What are you calling a trend?

618
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:10,792
Wham! Bham! Chuck!
is not the trend.

619
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,917
You hold on to your patience.

620
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,000
don't jump into haste

621
00:30:14,042 --> 00:30:15,667
Fall in love when you're
60 and get married at 80

622
00:30:15,708 --> 00:30:18,250
then sit on the bed during
the night and just gawk.

623
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:21,458
Look here, sex is not
everything in life.

624
00:30:21,917 --> 00:30:24,125
There's living snuck in
between dating and mating.

625
00:30:24,208 --> 00:30:26,500
You'll be sharing everything
from your life with her.

626
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:27,917
First learn to respect them.

627
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:30,708
When you look at a girl, think
with your head not your pants.

628
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,667
Mr.Buddha, be a man.

629
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:33,917
What do you mean by that?

630
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,250
Having sex with every girl
you meet is not a man.

631
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:36,792
Ey!

632
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:38,958
Listen, don't force
me into this anymore.

633
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:40,375
Love should happen eventually

634
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,292
it can't be forced or
convinced to happen.

635
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,917
Ey---just think logically.

636
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:48,083
Are you going to stay
single throughout your life?

637
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,833
Why would I stay single?

638
00:30:51,125 --> 00:30:52,625
I have you guys, my friends.

639
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:55,292
Oh God, no!

640
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,667
-He's starting again
from scratch -Nisha!

641
00:31:01,208 --> 00:31:02,750
Why is she not taking the call?

642
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:05,583
-Where did Nisha go?
-No idea!

643
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:07,458
It's 12 am, damn it.

644
00:31:10,125 --> 00:31:11,417
Nisha, please dear

645
00:31:11,458 --> 00:31:13,583
-I've realized my mistake
-Don't show me your face anymore

646
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:14,458
-Get lost
-Please talk to me

647
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,208
Who is that?

648
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:16,583
Nisha!

649
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:17,917
-What happened Nisha?
-Hey, stop!

650
00:31:18,208 --> 00:31:19,750
-Nothing!
-Hey you! Stop!

651
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,875
-nothing happened, let's go
-Ey -Nisha!?

652
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:23,292
What do you want me to say?

653
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:24,792
Twenty years ago

654
00:31:24,833 --> 00:31:29,750
he abandoned us, stating
I was not born to him.

655
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:32,958
Now that he's grown old, his
love for us is pouring in

656
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,875
-He's asking me to stay with
him -Ey, is that your father?

657
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,583
He's doesn't fit the
bill, to be a father.

658
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,458
Fine, what did you tell him?

659
00:31:42,875 --> 00:31:43,792
I told him, I won't.

660
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,583
No matter what happens,
I won't go back to him.

661
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:46,917
Why did you do that?

662
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,542
What else do you
expect me to say?

663
00:31:48,542 --> 00:31:50,542
Are you asking her,
to go back to him?

664
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:51,792
Why not?

665
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:56,000
You're angry, 'cause he was
not there for you, when needed.

666
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:58,292
But you're repeating
the same mistake.

667
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,417
Ey!

668
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,583
Are you taking his side?

669
00:32:01,583 --> 00:32:03,292
I'm not taking his side.

670
00:32:03,292 --> 00:32:04,417
Think about it--

671
00:32:04,417 --> 00:32:06,125
--why should he comeback
looking for you now?

672
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:08,792
It seems, there's no
heir to his wealth.

673
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,833
He wants me to be his
heir to the wealth.

674
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:14,000
You men make
mistakes as you wish

675
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:15,875
but us women should come
running, once called.

676
00:32:15,875 --> 00:32:18,000
Ey---I didn't mean it that way

677
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:21,250
It's fine, if you don't wanna accept
the person, who has realized his mistake

678
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,625
but please don't ignore him.

679
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:31,000
'After that Nisha got
back with her father.'

680
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:32,500
-Fine, let it go.
-This is the reason...

681
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:35,625
no matter how much I hate
him, I can't getaway from him

682
00:32:37,208 --> 00:32:38,917
'Success calls for a party

683
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,167
everyone was happy graduating'

684
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,208
'And was busy partying'

685
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,792
'Don't even try
looking for me here

686
00:32:45,833 --> 00:32:47,500
'Cause, I'm not there.'

687
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,083
Hey, how come you're calling me?

688
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:54,208
Don't be kidding Dev. You were
suppose to send pictures and videos.

689
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,458
Why haven't you sent it yet?

690
00:32:55,542 --> 00:32:58,708
I didn't get paid for
the previous gig yet

691
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,333
If you're freelancer,
payments will delay

692
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,583
I've been offering you
a job since 2 years

693
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:04,292
-You better take it.
-I'll think about it.

694
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,000
I can only think about
it after 6 months

695
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,875
Why?

696
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,750
I'm planning climb Everest,
heading for training.

697
00:33:09,833 --> 00:33:11,875
Have you gone mad? It's risky.

698
00:33:11,917 --> 00:33:13,500
Many have died in an
Avalanche over there.

699
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,625
Hey Dev, there's been an issue

700
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:15,917
-Not an adventure but Suicide
-I'll call you back

701
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:17,292
-What happened?
-They're beating up Vicky.

702
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,875
-Come on, let's go.
-What the hell?

703
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,667
'How can he do this to Rosie?'

704
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,167
Buddy, come on beat them up.

705
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:50,208
Buddy, the Police is here...run!

706
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,500
Run samosa run, we're
dead if we get caught.

707
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,125
Why the hell are
you making me run?

708
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:54,958
Hey, stop guys..that's enough.

709
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,083
Stop!

710
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,000
-Did they hurt you bad?
-Yes!

711
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,583
Ah...that's ketchup though.

712
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:09,625
They started beating me
up while I was eating.

713
00:34:09,708 --> 00:34:12,000
-what did you do?
-I didn't do anything

714
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,417
-Ey...!
-Ah...ah!

715
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:14,833
You know Rosie right?

716
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:15,958
Yes I do.

717
00:34:16,042 --> 00:34:18,458
She was with George
during the 1st Semester

718
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,708
2nd semester, she
was with Anthony.

719
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,750
3rd semester, she
was with David.

720
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:25,875
Fine, once the course is completed,
thought she might need a companion

721
00:34:25,917 --> 00:34:27,625
so asked her, if she
can hook up with me?

722
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:30,167
-Damn you!
-So they came to beat me up.

723
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,792
-They shouldn't have
beaten you up -Ya!

724
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,958
-Instead should've killed you
-Damn it, don't.

725
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:36,750
I knew it is wrong

726
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,958
but doing something
which is forbidden

727
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,833
is what makes us boys
from Tamilnadu rock.

728
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:43,375
I'm no different.

729
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,417
I made a mistake that day.

730
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,083
when he was all romantic--

731
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:50,917
--I should've take him to
America and abandoned him

732
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,750
I should've arrived at
San Fransisco airport

733
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:57,000
but landed at Chennai airport
fearing when the scaffold break on me.

734
00:34:57,042 --> 00:35:02,208
I was wondering during the flight,
how come he's so happy all the time

735
00:35:02,208 --> 00:35:04,792
there were people waiting at the
airport for his grand welcome.

736
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,250
-Mani!
-Don't touch, damn it.

737
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:08,333
-That's my Boss Jr.
-What is all this, Mani?

738
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:11,042
Everyone should
know, you've arrived.

739
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,375
A father, who perceives
everything positively.

740
00:35:14,417 --> 00:35:17,750
Velu, how long have you
decided to stay like this?

741
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,792
Let the kids explore.

742
00:35:19,833 --> 00:35:22,583
World is not constrained
to man made walls.

743
00:35:23,875 --> 00:35:27,167
Don't scare yourself and
turn the kids coward.

744
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,417
-Hiiii!
-Hey dear, how are you?

745
00:35:29,417 --> 00:35:30,958
-Dev uncle is here
-Bunked college is it?

746
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,417
This is their tide!

747
00:35:33,167 --> 00:35:34,125
Dad!

748
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:44,708
To sum up, a perfect
and a beautiful family.

749
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,042
Not everyone can get lucky.

750
00:35:50,125 --> 00:35:53,042
But, he too had a weakness.

751
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:56,292
His, Mother!

752
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,333
'She passed, when he was born.'

753
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:21,375
'She used to take
everyone's picture.

754
00:36:21,417 --> 00:36:23,333
you can't find her
any of the pictures.'

755
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:38,958
'This imaginary sketch he
drew, remained as his mother.'

756
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:44,208
'He was raised by his father,

757
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:47,833
that's why he's naturally
courageous and strong.'

758
00:37:00,292 --> 00:37:03,958
Oh no, dear please
wipe your tears.

759
00:37:04,083 --> 00:37:06,375
Now walk in with no fear.

760
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:09,208
Your friends are
waiting for you inside.

761
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:09,917
you should be smiling always

762
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:12,292
'His father didn't want
him to miss his mother--

763
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:15,458
--he put the umbilical chord in
this locket and gave it to him.

764
00:37:16,042 --> 00:37:20,000
'Anyways, Interesting part
of the life is uncertainty.'

765
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,125
something I had wished
for, is about to happen.'

766
00:37:27,417 --> 00:37:28,500
Excuse me!

767
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:29,833
Excuse me, please!

768
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:31,042
Ya, thank you.

769
00:37:31,042 --> 00:37:32,833
Eh...Ah!
Hey...Hey!

770
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:41,750
Hello!

771
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:42,958
-Ey..buddy!
-Tell me..

772
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,333
I just saw her

773
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,917
Idiot, who did you see?

774
00:37:45,958 --> 00:37:47,458
Mohana, damn it.

775
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:48,583
Mohana uh?

776
00:37:48,625 --> 00:37:50,458
That's right, your bear girl.

777
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,167
Bear....

778
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:53,208
Is it Meghna?

779
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,833
Exactly, I'm following
her at the moment.

780
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,333
-Is she in Chennai?
-Yes!

781
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:57,458
Come, if you believe me.

782
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,917
If not laze at home.

783
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,583
Ey---I'm coming right away.
Where are you?

784
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:01,750
Dev...!

785
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,750
-Bye aunty, I'm getting late
-Wait, wait...

786
00:38:02,792 --> 00:38:03,833
Where are you running off to?

787
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:04,750
I have something
important to tend to

788
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:07,167
Is it more important
than meeting me?

789
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:08,417
Oh no...!

790
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:09,917
I'm going to find a match,
I'll get back and speak to you.

791
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,417
Always kidding around.

792
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,500
When are you going to
take over the business?

793
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:13,292
Oh no!

794
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,417
-Son!
-Yes, Dad.

795
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:16,083
Your phone is ringing, pick up.

796
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,542
Seems like you're headed for
something important, carry on.

797
00:38:20,625 --> 00:38:21,208
I'm leaving, Dad.

798
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,917
-I love you, Dad.
-Be careful, dear.

799
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:23,792
Lingam!

800
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:26,417
If you keep encouraging
him like this--

801
00:38:26,458 --> 00:38:29,125
--in the end, he'll end up
doing nothing in his life.

802
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:31,375
First, ask him to take
over the business.

803
00:38:31,375 --> 00:38:32,167
Geetha!

804
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,625
Our only job is to
teach them how to walk.

805
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:39,375
You should never hold back,
who wants to grow up and run.

806
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:41,000
Nisha, where are you?

807
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,833
I'm right here, following her.

808
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,542
I know that, where
are you right now?

809
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,833
I'm heading towards, Mount Road.

810
00:38:45,875 --> 00:38:47,167
I'm on my way there too,
will be there in 5 minutes.

811
00:38:47,167 --> 00:38:48,333
Come sooner.

812
00:38:56,458 --> 00:38:57,542
Hey, where are you?

813
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,708
Hello, I've reached
Mount Road signal

814
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,792
I'm there too.

815
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:03,167
-where are you exactly?
-I'm next to Spencers

816
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:04,417
I'm out there too

817
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:05,583
I'm not able to spot you.

818
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,208
Ey---my signal turned green

819
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:08,375
I spotted you, I'm coming

820
00:39:08,417 --> 00:39:09,833
Hey...fool!

821
00:39:09,875 --> 00:39:11,125
What's wrong with you?

822
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:11,750
What happened?

823
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,792
A guy blocked my way

824
00:39:13,917 --> 00:39:14,708
What car is she riding in?

825
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:17,042
She's riding in a
blue color Mercedes.

826
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,667
If I had gone a bit faster,
could've caught her.

827
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:23,333
Damn, I was this
close and missed her.

828
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:30,125
Dev!

829
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,125
De...Dev!

830
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,125
Dev!

831
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:34,167
are you there?

832
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:29,958
Ya, Mom!

833
00:40:30,167 --> 00:40:32,042
I'll see your soon, Ya!

834
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,083
Hey---move the car!

835
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:52,917
Move, damn it!

836
00:41:19,667 --> 00:41:20,875
Don't you have any sense?

837
00:41:21,167 --> 00:41:22,750
Are you crazy?

838
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:26,083
Have you gone blind, damn it?

839
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,417
Sorry!

840
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:30,292
How are your even driving?

841
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:31,833
Damn!

842
00:41:41,208 --> 00:41:43,042
Seems like you're love struck.

843
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:44,708
A right age for
the feeling though

844
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,750
not at all wrong

845
00:41:45,792 --> 00:41:48,792
It'll be great if you could pull
over and not block the traffic.

846
00:41:50,833 --> 00:41:51,750
I got it!

847
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:54,833
There's one, their
house has one too.

848
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:56,958
Tommy, a dog.

849
00:41:57,417 --> 00:41:58,833
Who is that person with Tommy?

850
00:41:59,000 --> 00:41:59,958
Padmavati!

851
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,500
It's Meghna Padmavati, damn it!

852
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:05,000
I'm pretty sure,
she uses Jio Sim.

853
00:42:05,042 --> 00:42:06,875
'Cause she's online 24/7

854
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:09,000
also she checks-in
wherever she goes.

855
00:42:09,083 --> 00:42:11,958
So, if we get hold of her.
We can reach Meghna too.

856
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:23,208
Proposing to a girl and
making Rasagulla are the same.

857
00:42:23,417 --> 00:42:25,917
Rasagulla can't be
made with good milk

858
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:29,083
it can be prepared
only from spoilt milk.

859
00:42:29,125 --> 00:42:31,583
So, when you speak to her,
maintain your dignity.

860
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:32,333
Understood?

861
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:42,292
Hey Tom...

862
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:43,917
...damn, it's Meghna's mother.

863
00:42:46,125 --> 00:42:47,500
-What do we do now?
-Oh no!

864
00:42:48,417 --> 00:42:49,417
Hi aunty!

865
00:42:50,958 --> 00:42:52,083
Hey--it's Meghna!

866
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:53,292
Oh no, it's Meghna!

867
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:54,542
Mom, I've been looking for you.

868
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:55,875
Why are you guys
scared, come on get in.

869
00:42:55,875 --> 00:42:56,875
I missed you too.

870
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:58,167
So good to see you.

871
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,750
-Buddy, talk to her
-How was your journey?

872
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:01,667
-Good!
-I can't over here

873
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:03,750
Turn around and give a smile

874
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,500
-"I like you very much
-We'll leave in 15 minutes

875
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,750
do you like me too", ask her.

876
00:43:06,958 --> 00:43:08,375
I can't it's so lame.

877
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:10,083
Ey--I'll kill you damn it.
There's nothing lame in love.

878
00:43:10,125 --> 00:43:12,042
Oh no, I think they heard us.

879
00:43:13,167 --> 00:43:14,292
Any problem?

880
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,125
Ah...Ah, starting trouble aunty.

881
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,500
Be courageous and confident.

882
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:22,958
Ey---you're damn lucky

883
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,833
aunty had given a
go, come on speak up.

884
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:29,333
Lord Muruga, save me from this.

885
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,625
What the hell do you
think of yourself?

886
00:43:33,917 --> 00:43:34,958
Don't you have any sense?

887
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,250
use your brains, man.

888
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:37,625
I'm running on a tight schedule.

889
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,792
No, I don't want an explanation.

890
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,917
-Excuse me!
-The lift doesn't seem to open

891
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:43,042
You please go, Lord Amman.

892
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:44,792
She seemed too calm
in the picture though.

893
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,542
Come outside, why
are you scared?

894
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:47,875
Ey---I'm not scared.

895
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:48,667
Caution!

896
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:50,000
I shouldn't mess it
up the first time.

897
00:43:50,125 --> 00:43:52,292
Ey---she doesn't
know who you are?

898
00:43:52,333 --> 00:43:53,708
According to her--

899
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:55,750
--him and you are the same.

900
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:57,333
-He's correct!
-Uh..!

901
00:43:57,375 --> 00:43:59,167
-He's correct, right?
-Ya!

902
00:43:59,208 --> 00:44:00,042
Then you go and speak to her.

903
00:44:00,083 --> 00:44:01,625
Ah...Ey! I can't, please.

904
00:44:01,667 --> 00:44:03,708
Only a woman can
understand another woman.

905
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,125
-Go now.
-So you believe I'm a girl

906
00:44:05,125 --> 00:44:06,333
Nisha, Vetrivel!

907
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:07,958
-Reply..Veeravel damn it
-Get lost, damn it.

908
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:08,792
Come on, go.

909
00:44:09,542 --> 00:44:10,750
Oh God!

910
00:44:10,792 --> 00:44:12,625
-It's a very important meeting -Dev
is a good guy and loves you very much?

911
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,292
-So, I need a proper arrangement.
-Yes, I will do it

912
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:15,792
-Excuse, me!
-Of course...Yes!?

913
00:44:17,833 --> 00:44:19,625
Where is the ladies restroom?

914
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:21,875
I think, this way

915
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:22,750
Thanks!

916
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:25,292
Did you do it?

917
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:26,375
-I couldn't do it.
-Is she alright?

918
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:27,458
Idiot!

919
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,375
She's asking for restroom, and
you're not even opening your mouth.

920
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,042
It's embarrassing to have
you guys as friends.

921
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,750
Listen, look at me

922
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:36,125
girth is not just rejecting
the girl who comes after you

923
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:38,542
but to impress
the girl you like.

924
00:44:38,917 --> 00:44:40,667
Now what, you want
me to talk to her?

925
00:44:40,708 --> 00:44:42,417
That's what I've been
ranting all this while.

926
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:43,917
Look, she's heading out.

927
00:44:44,083 --> 00:44:46,708

is going for a fight.

982

now see, it worked out.

983
00:48:15,583 --> 00:48:17,750
Buddy, just stick to
what we'd discussed.

984
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:25,833
-Hey!
-Hi!

985
00:48:26,458 --> 00:48:27,458
Who are you?

986
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,208
Dev!

987
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,708
What do you want?

988
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,042
A small request

989
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:32,833
What!?

990
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:34,542
to your Facebook

991
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:38,208
few days ago, I had
sent a friend request.

992
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,000
you haven't accepted it yet.

993
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,042
It'll be great if
you could accept it.

994
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:45,708
Do you know me?

995
00:48:52,333 --> 00:48:53,500
Do I know you?

996
00:48:54,750 --> 00:48:56,542
Not yet. But we can get to know.

997
00:48:56,792 --> 00:48:58,792
Everyone is a stranger,
before being friends.

998
00:48:58,875 --> 00:48:59,667
Oh!

999
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:01,667
I don't have time for all this.

1000
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:03,917
Anyways, let's see your luck

1001
00:49:04,333 --> 00:49:06,083
I'm leaving in two minutes

1002
00:49:06,375 --> 00:49:07,917
trying finding and accept it.

1003
00:49:10,292 --> 00:49:12,167
'Four thousand friend requests'

1004
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,125
'It's all men, damn it'

1005
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:16,458
'Bloody traitor!'

1006
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:18,042
'I'll take care of you later'

1007
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:19,708
Buddy, don't let her go

1008
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,042
'list is long and
doesn't seem to end'

1009
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,750
-Oh no!
-Time is up!

1010
00:49:23,792 --> 00:49:25,958
-Oh no!
-Samosa, your idea flopped.

1011
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:28,833
-Unfortunately. -Listen, so
what If I couldn't find it.

1012
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:30,333
Why don't you send
a friend request--

1013
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:31,792
--I'll accept it right away.

1014
00:49:31,917 --> 00:49:33,000
Meghna!

1015
00:49:38,625 --> 00:49:42,208
Dev, Meghna's mom has updated that
there's a product launch tomorrow

1016
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,042
Let's go there.

1017
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,083
Tell me something,
why do you like her?

1018
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,250
Her eyes!

1019
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,000
There's arrogance in her eyes

1020
00:50:13,667 --> 00:50:15,292
but there's something beyond it

1021
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,833
can't really explain though.

1022
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,917
But that's what excites me.

1023
00:50:21,958 --> 00:50:22,750
Good.

1024
00:50:22,833 --> 00:50:24,667
I've never seen you confused--

1025
00:50:24,875 --> 00:50:27,000
Something tells me,
she's your girl.

1026
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:28,542
Let's give it one more shot.

1027
00:50:28,583 --> 00:50:29,750
She's right buddy.

1028
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:31,167
Even if you don't feel like--

1029
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,542
--at least give it
a shot for my sake.

1030
00:50:32,583 --> 00:50:34,292
It's all 'cause of you.

1031
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:35,125
Thank you!

1032
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,250
Good Morning!

1033
00:50:56,458 --> 00:50:57,167
Language!

1034
00:50:57,583 --> 00:51:01,042
Right from telecommunication
to Governing a country

1035
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,208
it's the most important
tool for a human being.

1036
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:05,125
But how many of us--

1037
00:51:05,125 --> 00:51:07,833
--can learn or speak
another language easily?

1038
00:51:07,833 --> 00:51:10,125
Many such questions came up--

1039
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,833
--also we found
a solution to it.

1040
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:17,125
In this world, no
matter who it is--

1041
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,583
--using this device

1042
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:21,875
you can speak in your mother
tongue and communicate.

1043
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:25,292
And it'll translate
their language--

1044
00:51:25,292 --> 00:51:26,875
--and relay it in
your mother tongue.

1045
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,667
That too in split seconds.

1046
00:51:28,667 --> 00:51:29,917
I would take any
questions if you have?

1047
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:32,708
How far do you think, it
will be successful in India?

1048
00:51:33,958 --> 00:51:38,583
Our country has the diverse
set of languages in the world.

1049
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:40,958
approximately 150 languages.

1050
00:51:40,958 --> 00:51:43,083
Even if 1% is used, it's a success.

1051
00:51:43,083 --> 00:51:44,083
Brilliant!

1052
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:48,792
'Buddy, ask her if we can
listen to the radio on it?'

1053
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:54,500
Hi!

1054
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:58,208
I went online and searched
to know more about you

1055
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,542
I couldn't find anything
else but your work

1056
00:52:00,875 --> 00:52:02,667
If you could tell
us about yourself

1057
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:04,875
people who are always
thinking of you

1058
00:52:05,167 --> 00:52:06,875
I mean, like a role model

1059
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:09,708
also the people who like to
speak to you and get know you

1060
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:12,000
you know for business purposes

1061
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:13,417
-Get to the point.
-That's right!

1062
00:52:14,375 --> 00:52:17,167
You've achieved so
much by the age of 25.

1063
00:52:17,375 --> 00:52:19,250
I feel this question is
not relevant at the moment.

1064
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:19,917
Why?

1065
00:52:19,958 --> 00:52:23,708
But madam, youngsters who
aspire to grow in their business

1066
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:25,792
your reply will
be an inspiration.

1067
00:52:25,917 --> 00:52:27,708
So, please tell
us about yourself.

1068
00:52:27,708 --> 00:52:29,125
Yes madam, please.

1069
00:52:33,167 --> 00:52:34,042
Ok!

1070
00:52:34,458 --> 00:52:35,958
I was 5 years old

1071
00:52:36,333 --> 00:52:37,833
my mother and I

1072
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:41,542
had gone abroad with a person who
is not fit to be called as a father.

1073
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,833
A trip which we imagined
will be a joyous one

1074
00:52:43,875 --> 00:52:45,750
turned our lives, upside down.

1075
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:49,292
That man, abandoned
us both and ran away.

1076
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:50,958
We didn't have our passports.

1077
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,458
neither we had money nor
we knew the language.

1078
00:52:53,792 --> 00:52:55,458
They detained us
in that country--

1079
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,667
--and locked us up
in a refugee camp.

1080
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:01,250
My mother Padmavati,
used to work really hard.

1081
00:53:01,708 --> 00:53:04,458
but just for my sake,
she always wore a smile

1082
00:53:04,458 --> 00:53:06,833
She's my only inspiration.

1083
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,417
I wanted to help my mother.

1084
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,333
But to work over there--

1085
00:53:11,792 --> 00:53:13,875
--I was not old enough
neither I had the strength

1086
00:53:13,917 --> 00:53:15,708
While I was wondering
how to help her out--

1087
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:17,500
--that one answer I figured was

1088
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:18,417
Language!

1089
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:21,625
People out there had
tough time communicating.

1090
00:53:21,833 --> 00:53:24,000
I started to work
as their translator.

1091
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,375
I don't get paid though

1092
00:53:25,625 --> 00:53:27,792
but I used to get a
piece of bread for hunger

1093
00:53:27,917 --> 00:53:32,125
That marked the beginning, for the
company and the life I have right now.

1094
00:53:34,667 --> 00:53:36,542
Do you really think
she will get impressed?

1095
00:53:36,542 --> 00:53:37,917
Definitely not possible.

1096
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:39,292
Now it's clear, why she
isn't interested in you.

1097
00:53:39,292 --> 00:53:40,208
-Come on, let's leave
-Let's go

1098
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:43,000
She literally hates
the entire race of men.

1099
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:44,792
Ma'am I have a question!

1100
00:53:44,833 --> 00:53:45,958
Ma'am I have a question--

1101
00:53:45,958 --> 00:53:47,417
--but, my colleague is
going to take your question.

1102
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:48,875
-Deepti!
-Yes, ma'am

1103
00:53:50,083 --> 00:53:51,333
Hey, stop!

1104
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:54,875
Who the hell are you? and
why are you stalking me?

1105
00:53:54,875 --> 00:53:56,667
Don't you have anything
better to do in your life?

1106
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,750
Guys like you are a disgrace.

1107
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:00,083
Meghna!

1108
00:54:00,458 --> 00:54:01,625
Control yourself.

1109
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:02,667
It's fine, aunty.

1110
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:04,458
She has every right to be angry.

1111
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:06,083
I did come after her.

1112
00:54:06,625 --> 00:54:08,667
I swear, it wasn't to
stalk or to disturb.

1113
00:54:09,042 --> 00:54:10,792
I saw you and liked
you very much.

1114
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,833
Thought of telling you the
same, that's why came after you

1115
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,792
I won't disturb you anymore.

1116
00:54:14,958 --> 00:54:16,750
What you've achieved
is not a simple thing.

1117
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:17,792
Congrats!

1118
00:54:18,167 --> 00:54:18,708
Bye!

1119
00:54:19,542 --> 00:54:20,375
Whatever!

1120
00:54:20,917 --> 00:54:22,333
Ma! come let's leave.

1121
00:54:30,625 --> 00:54:33,708
Ey--you've been hogging
and listening to music

1122
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,375
aren't you upset?

1123
00:54:35,375 --> 00:54:36,750
He's being a sport it seems.

1124
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,917
I saw and liked her a lot.

1125
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,167
Gave it a shot, it
didn't work out.

1126
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:43,625
Just like how we have
the right to try--

1127
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:45,500
--she has the same
right to reject it too.

1128
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:47,250
Ya sure, she does.

1129
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,667
Fine, what's next?

1130
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:51,458
Ah...I'm gonna drop
you guys and leave.

1131
00:54:57,958 --> 00:55:00,083
That guy doesn't seem
like a bad person.

1132
00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:02,333
Who are you talking about?

1133
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,833
The guy who you yelled
at in the morning.

1134
00:55:05,417 --> 00:55:06,917
Mom, please don't do this

1135
00:55:07,208 --> 00:55:09,292
to you everyone is a good soul.

1136
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:11,792
He found me on Facebook and
developed a liking right away.

1137
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:15,125
he's jobless and
have been stalking me

1138
00:55:15,417 --> 00:55:16,417
so filmy!

1139
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,958
Incorrigible!

1140
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:20,208
If a boy likes a girl--

1141
00:55:20,333 --> 00:55:24,250
--it's not wrong to express
it in one way or the other.

1142
00:55:24,542 --> 00:55:27,167
Mom, why are you being so
supportive of that guy?

1143
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:29,458
I'm not taking his side.

1144
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,958
I trying to say, you
need a companion.

1145
00:55:32,375 --> 00:55:36,208
Do you think you'll get
by without a companion?

1146
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,208
People who have endured being
lonely will know its pain.

1147
00:55:41,208 --> 00:55:43,458
In my life, relationship
didn't work.

1148
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:46,042
But it not only
affected me but you too.

1149
00:55:47,583 --> 00:55:48,583
I'm sorry!

1150
00:55:48,917 --> 00:55:50,500
Now why are you
getting emotional?

1151
00:55:50,792 --> 00:55:53,417
Don't think, you'll endure
the same like I did.

1152
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:56,833
Don't judge a person
without knowing them.

1153
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,792
Just 'cause a guy
goes after a girl--

1154
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,458
--he can't be considered
being desperate.

1155
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:03,292
Who knows, he might
turn out good.

1156
00:56:03,792 --> 00:56:05,833
I agree, that can't
trust everyone we meet.

1157
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:08,708
That doesn't mean, we
should stop living.

1158
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:11,833
Choose someone

1159
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:13,292
talk to him

1160
00:56:13,667 --> 00:56:14,667
chat with him

1161
00:56:14,708 --> 00:56:16,417
Get to know him well.

1162
00:56:16,625 --> 00:56:18,792
Your choice could be anyone.

1163
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,667
I will support you.

1164
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:22,250
I'm done cooking, let's eat.

1165
00:56:42,833 --> 00:56:44,417
Damn, what is this?

1166
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:46,333
-It's become a routine...
-Aye...damn it

1167
00:56:46,417 --> 00:56:48,000
Stop raising your voice

1168
00:56:48,125 --> 00:56:50,208
-my life is a mess -you're
drunk and beating me up

1169
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:52,125
On top it, this
trouble was born to us.

1170
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:54,875
-Just get out of my house.
-Stop it!

1171
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:57,375
Beep.

1172
00:57:22,417 --> 00:57:23,083
HELP!

1173
00:57:23,083 --> 00:57:24,542
Ey--she's getting
away, catch her.

1174
00:57:24,583 --> 00:57:26,417
-Buddy, she's running
-Come on, catch hold of her

1175
00:57:26,458 --> 00:57:27,875
-Stop, damn it
-Ey...Ey!

1176
00:57:29,083 --> 00:57:30,083
Help!

1177
00:57:40,125 --> 00:57:41,458
Hey, hey...stop!

1178
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:47,875
Hey, hey...don't.

1179
00:57:48,042 --> 00:57:50,708
Hey...come on, let's
leave from here.

1180
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:52,625
Are you alright?

1181
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,250
They left.

1182
00:57:55,458 --> 00:57:56,417
Let's go.

1183
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,583
What's it? Did they run away?

1184
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:04,292
Ya, they ran away.

1185
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:06,042
She's from our locale

1186
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:07,750
you can leave, we'll
take care of her.

1187
00:58:08,792 --> 00:58:10,000
Oh she's from your locale?

1188
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:11,750
No issues, I'll manage.

1189
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:12,583
Come on.

1190
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:17,792
Get lost!

1191
00:58:39,625 --> 00:58:40,583
Get inside.

1192
00:58:54,208 --> 00:58:55,958
What are you staring at?
Kill him, damn it.

1193
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:57,958
Hey, you too go on..

1194
00:58:58,750 --> 00:58:59,875
Hey...!

1195
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:31,833
He made a mistake, so I hit him.

1196
00:59:32,458 --> 00:59:33,292
If you guys let me go---

1197
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:34,750
---I'll take the girl
and be gone from here.

1198
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:35,625
If we don't!?

1199
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:37,292
I'll still take her,
even if you don't.

1200
00:59:37,542 --> 00:59:40,083
But one thing, you guys
won't forget me forever

1201
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:42,000
Arrogance---is it?

1202
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,333
CONFIDENCE!

1203
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:46,750
'Ey-Ey-come on, drop it--

1204
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,625
--come on, let's
scoot from here.'

1205
01:00:53,792 --> 01:00:54,583
Are you ok?

1206
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:57,292
He betrayed me in love.

1207
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:01,625
If it's not for you, I don't
know what would've happened.

1208
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:05,083
If not me, it must've
been someone else.

1209
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,792
Many did notice,
but chose to ignore.

1210
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,250
Only you stopped your car.

1211
01:01:16,167 --> 01:01:19,625
Not sure why, I feel
really safe around you.

1212
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:21,750
Will you be there for me?

1213
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:23,750
Sure, sister.

1214
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:31,500
What's your name?

1215
01:01:32,083 --> 01:01:32,833
Krithika!

1216
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:35,125
Krithika, you're really pretty.

1217
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,542
You seem like an
intelligent and bold women.

1218
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:41,000
Let me tell you something, never
force yourself into a relationship.

1219
01:01:41,833 --> 01:01:43,167
Just 'cause one betrayed you--

1220
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:45,667
--you'll end up accusing
every man you meet.

1221
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:48,042
You'll be irritated with
the notion of a man.

1222
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:51,125
But then one day, a true and an
genuine man will come into your life

1223
01:01:51,792 --> 01:01:53,417
as you were betrayed before

1224
01:01:53,417 --> 01:01:55,542
you don't have to
miss out on him.

1225
01:01:56,375 --> 01:01:57,667
Don't worry about what happened

1226
01:01:57,708 --> 01:01:58,750
be happy.

1227
01:01:59,292 --> 01:02:00,458
You have a lot of time.

1228
01:02:00,958 --> 01:02:01,667
Ok!

1229
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:05,375
Ok.

1230
01:02:05,875 --> 01:02:07,083
I'll get down here.

1231
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,292
What is your name?

1232
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:10,333
Dev!

1233
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,250
-Thanks a lot
-Fine!

1234
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:26,292
Ey---look at her all calm,
as if nothing happened.

1235
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,667
Hey Krithika!

1236
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,042
I did tell you, this is
risky and not to do it.

1237
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:33,500
If at all we had been caught alone,
imagine what could've happened

1238
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,833
We didn't get caught right?

1239
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:37,292
Don't get cocky 'cause
nothing happened.

1240
01:02:38,292 --> 01:02:41,292
Nope, I'm happy that
I met a real man.

1241
01:02:42,083 --> 01:02:44,083
Take this, upload it right away.

1242
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,833
A young girl who got stuck
with anti-social elements

1243
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:54,208
Dev Ramalingam saved
her with utmost courage

1244
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,750
has gone viral on social media.

1245
01:02:56,792 --> 01:03:00,750
Safety of women after
dark is an impending issue

1246
01:03:00,792 --> 01:03:05,625
also there's accusation of people
who don't come forward to help

1247
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,083
Hey Dev, wake up.

1248
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:08,875
-Wake up, damn it
-Hey...!

1249
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,125
You're a talk of the town

1250
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:11,042
but you're sleeping out here

1251
01:03:11,083 --> 01:03:12,542
'Never force yourself
into a relationship'

1252
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:15,000
'Just 'cause you were betrayed

1253
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,500
--you'll end up accusing
every man you meet.'

1254
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,500
You'll be irritated with
the notion of a man.

1255
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:20,667
-what is it?
-You nailed it.

1256
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:22,375
'But then one day, a true and an
genuine man will come into your life'

1257
01:03:22,833 --> 01:03:23,958
if you end up not trusting him.'

1258
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:26,292
Have no sense, where
to place a camera.

1259
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:28,375
You haven't changed in spite
of advanced technology.

1260
01:03:28,417 --> 01:03:31,083
Muthulakshmi, my
son-in-law is on the TV.

1261
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:32,625
-I'm leaving to office.
-Ok fine

1262
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:34,167
Hereafter, come home
late in the night

1263
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:35,792
-only then the city will be safe.
-Get lost.

1264
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:38,417
Do you have a formal dress?

1265
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:40,125
-I don't, why?
-Fine, let's buy one.

1266
01:03:40,292 --> 01:03:41,875
We have an important
thing to do.

1267
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:45,625
I doesn't look crowded though.

1268
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,667
They all don't look like
a competition to me.

1269
01:03:48,667 --> 01:03:50,292
Moreover I'm wearing
a well creased shirt

1270
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:54,250
surprisingly, there's a
girl waiting next to me.

1271
01:03:54,458 --> 01:03:56,042
I'll get back to you, once...

1272
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,083
Hi...!

1273
01:04:03,708 --> 01:04:05,208
-Hey Vicky, stop
-Vicky!

1274
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,625
Ey--buddy, why did
you leave half way?

1275
01:04:06,625 --> 01:04:07,750
come on, let's
attend the interview

1276
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,292
Ey---I believe you
both are my friends.

1277
01:04:10,375 --> 01:04:12,583
Your intentions are to
never see me happy in life

1278
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:15,125
buddy, not just happy,
you should be very happy.

1279
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:16,792
This is not the place
for your skills.

1280
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:19,625
Enough, I don't have any talent
neither there's a place for it.

1281
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:22,333
Just like my Dad states, I'm
useless, fir for nothing and dumb.

1282
01:04:22,375 --> 01:04:23,458
Ey---don't yell damn it.

1283
01:04:24,083 --> 01:04:25,958
I can handle my life,
please leave me alone.

1284
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:26,750
Please!

1285
01:04:27,208 --> 01:04:29,417
Buddy, I think you're hungry.

1286
01:04:29,458 --> 01:04:30,958
-That's why you're angry
-Oh!

1287
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:32,333
-Damn it!
-Oh, you're hungry is it?

1288
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:33,833
Come on, let's eat and talk.

1289
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,583
-Come on!
-How many of you gone to USA?

1290
01:04:36,458 --> 01:04:38,125
Nobody has gone to USA, uh?

1291
01:04:38,125 --> 01:04:39,500
Real USA, nobody goes uh?

1292
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,875
Only gone whatsapp,
Facebook and Instagram, uh?

1293
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:45,000
In my time, when I go to USA. In
mount road, one building is there.

1294
01:04:45,125 --> 01:04:46,750
That is only first entry of USA.

1295
01:04:46,958 --> 01:04:48,167
US Consulate.

1296
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:51,292
Next we go to the peter city
Bombay airport announcement.

1297
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:52,125
Buddy, he's awesome.

1298
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,875
Ey---don't irritate me.

1299
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:56,500
Do you call this a comedy?

1300
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,542
Do you think so?

1301
01:04:58,167 --> 01:04:59,458
-Bosss!
-Eh..

1302
01:04:59,833 --> 01:05:00,625
Yes!

1303
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:03,333
Boss, you call this a comedy?
Not funny.

1304
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:04,125
Not funny!?

1305
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:06,000
It wasn't me, he said it though.

1306
01:05:06,042 --> 01:05:06,875
Ey...!

1307
01:05:07,042 --> 01:05:09,042
-Don't web me into this
-Ask him to come here

1308
01:05:09,042 --> 01:05:09,958
Buddy, go on..

1309
01:05:09,958 --> 01:05:11,083
-Sir, please come
-Come on, go

1310
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:12,708
-Come, on. -Go over there
-Come on, damn it

1311
01:05:12,792 --> 01:05:14,250
-Boss, Vicky is coming up
-Every give an applause

1312
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:16,250
for the new stand-up comedian.

1313
01:05:16,292 --> 01:05:17,250
Please come up.

1314
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:18,625
Welcome, Mr.Stand-up comedian.

1315
01:05:18,625 --> 01:05:21,125
-Vicky! Vicky!
-Come on go on the stage

1316
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,042
Please start.

1317
01:05:22,083 --> 01:05:24,250
-Heyyyy!
-Wooohooo!

1318
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,042
Good morning!

1319
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:29,917
Everybody say Good morning,
sir is saying good morning

1320
01:05:29,917 --> 01:05:31,042
Good morning, good morning...

1321
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:33,917
What's next?
Attendance!

1322
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:37,125
Ey--come on buddy.

1323
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,500
That's working fine.

1324
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:41,583
Check this one, if
its working fine.

1325
01:05:41,583 --> 01:05:42,375
Come on do it.

1326
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:46,875
Actually...uh

1327
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:52,625
It's easy to pass
comments from down there

1328
01:05:52,625 --> 01:05:54,875
only when you get down
to do it, you'll know

1329
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:57,500
now let's back to real
Stand-up comedy guys

1330
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:59,500
Such sound makes
you think at airport

1331
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:00,292
Ey---!

1332
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:02,708
-Stop, where are you going?
-Ey let me go!

1333
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,500
Are you happy now?

1334
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,208
you've insulted me
in front of everyone.

1335
01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:07,208
are you satisfied?

1336
01:06:07,375 --> 01:06:08,417
Aren't you ashamed?

1337
01:06:08,458 --> 01:06:10,458
He trolled you royally,
and you kept quiet.

1338
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,250
Ey, it's not a matter
of trolling him

1339
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,792
ask him to come to our locale.

1340
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:15,958
I'll make him bend over.

1341
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:17,125
Do you have the guts?

1342
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,750
Ey, you think I'm
scared of this idiot?

1343
01:06:19,792 --> 01:06:20,625
Then go up there and speak.

1344
01:06:20,625 --> 01:06:22,125
-Boss! -Do you know
how they speak...?

1345
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,750
Shall we try one more time?

1346
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:26,583
It's fine, we can.

1347
01:06:26,625 --> 01:06:27,333
Ey, go there.

1348
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:28,708
Get there damn it.
Come on, speak up.

1349
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:29,583
Ey--shut up!

1350
01:06:36,042 --> 01:06:37,208
Greetings to one and all.

1351
01:06:37,792 --> 01:06:39,458
I'm going to speak in Tamizh.

1352
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,625
The real Tamizh
Stand-up Comedy, boss.

1353
01:06:44,958 --> 01:06:45,958
That's my friend Dev

1354
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
he said let's go
to a coffee shop.

1355
01:06:48,125 --> 01:06:51,375
You mean the coffee shop, where
foreign language songs are played

1356
01:06:51,417 --> 01:06:52,958
menu will be confusing

1357
01:06:52,958 --> 01:06:55,500
moreover we end up buying a
coffee worth of 30 rupees for 300.

1358
01:06:55,542 --> 01:06:58,458
and have it for long
until it gets cold.

1359
01:06:58,542 --> 01:06:59,708
He agreed with me though.

1360
01:06:59,708 --> 01:07:03,917
Fine, I came to terms
to have that coffee

1361
01:07:03,958 --> 01:07:06,042
our brother here was
performing Stand-up comedy

1362
01:07:06,292 --> 01:07:09,042
I've noticed, all the stand-up
comedians once they start

1363
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:10,167
asks, "Have you gone to USA?"

1364
01:07:10,167 --> 01:07:11,292
"Have you gone to Africa?"

1365
01:07:11,333 --> 01:07:12,250
"Have you been on a flight?"

1366
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:14,750
If I could afford doing all that,
why would I be watching you perform?

1367
01:07:17,833 --> 01:07:18,875
Good one!

1368
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:33,875
Brother, let's take a selfie.

1369
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,917
Woohoo!

1370
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:40,333
-Thank you, brother. -Nice meeting you.
-Thank you.

1371
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:42,167
-Thank you.
-Bye...!

1372
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:46,708
'I'm the ladies man, no
one can compete with me'

1373
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:50,375
Ey Samosa, seems like you've
become a celebrity overnight.

1374
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:52,500
How many phone
numbers did you get?

1375
01:07:52,667 --> 01:07:55,208
Excuse me, my days of
getting numbers are gone

1376
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,208
rather I'm in a place,
where I give out my number.

1377
01:07:57,917 --> 01:07:59,500
Arghhh!

1378
01:07:59,667 --> 01:08:02,125
Don't forget that you're
speaking to a star.

1379
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:03,875
What are you looking at?

1380
01:08:03,958 --> 01:08:04,625
Give it to me.

1381
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:07,792
Ey---Meghna has sent
him a friend request.

1382
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:08,792
-Thank you.
-What!?

1383
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:09,917
Can I have your number...?

1384
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:11,542
She's asking for his number,
shall I give it to her.

1385
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:13,167
-There's no need for it.
-Ey--give that back.

1386
01:08:13,458 --> 01:08:15,292
She has yelled enough, now she
wants to do it over the phone too.

1387
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:17,083
How do you know, she's
asking the number to yell?

1388
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:17,458
Give it to me.

1389
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,833
I know about these women,
the keep yelling at you.

1390
01:08:19,875 --> 01:08:22,208
Hey...she's calling
from Facebook.

1391
01:08:23,083 --> 01:08:23,833
Take it.

1392
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:27,875
Hello!

1393
01:08:30,750 --> 01:08:31,542
Hello!?

1394
01:08:32,667 --> 01:08:33,583
Hello...

1395
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:34,667
Hey...Hi!

1396
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:36,333
Can we talk?

1397
01:08:36,708 --> 01:08:39,292
Ummm...sure we can talk.

1398
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:43,667
Why did you cancel the friend
request you sent before?

1399
01:08:43,708 --> 01:08:45,458
Oh you canceled it?

1400
01:08:46,708 --> 01:08:50,250
I thought you
weren't interested.

1401
01:08:50,792 --> 01:08:51,500
Oh!

1402
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:53,667
Let's take it, I'm
interested now.

1403
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,375
Did she just say,
she's interested?

1404
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:57,250
When you came after me

1405
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,167
if I had responded to it

1406
01:08:59,167 --> 01:09:00,417
what do you think,
you would've done?

1407
01:09:00,917 --> 01:09:02,583
That's too sudden for me

1408
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:04,917
even you appeared
suddenly in my life.

1409
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:07,917
Uncertain things are the
most interesting ones.

1410
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,250
The excitement at
the sight of you

1411
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:12,792
I wanted to know, if
you feel the same too.

1412
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:13,667
So, I came.

1413
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,167
Ok...

1414
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:16,583
...and?

1415
01:09:20,417 --> 01:09:21,500
May be

1416
01:09:21,542 --> 01:09:22,333
we could've

1417
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:23,833
been friends

1418
01:09:23,833 --> 01:09:24,708
Ey...!

1419
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:26,875
-Friend, really?
-Umm, are you sure?

1420
01:09:27,083 --> 01:09:28,083
Friend?

1421
01:09:28,333 --> 01:09:30,000
So were you expecting
just friendship?

1422
01:09:30,542 --> 01:09:32,125
-Tell her, I love you
-Propose, damn it

1423
01:09:32,167 --> 01:09:33,333
I can't do it, shut up.

1424
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:34,875
Ey--shut up guys.

1425
01:09:34,875 --> 01:09:37,125
-Are you there?
-Eh...Ya!

1426
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:39,000
So was it just friendship
you had in mind?

1427
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:42,083
Not really

1428
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:46,625
That was not my intention,
to just be friends.

1429
01:09:47,667 --> 01:09:48,375
Ok.

1430
01:09:52,958 --> 01:09:55,042
But, I don't believe
in love at first sight.

1431
01:09:55,625 --> 01:09:57,375
If you wish, we
can meet for coffee

1432
01:09:57,417 --> 01:09:58,167
let's talk.

1433
01:09:58,458 --> 01:10:00,333
Later if something develops,
we'll think about it.

1434
01:10:00,625 --> 01:10:01,333
Ok!?

1435
01:10:02,167 --> 01:10:03,167
Ok.

1436
01:10:03,625 --> 01:10:06,375
Fine, I'll text you where
shall we meet in a while.

1437
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:07,292
Bye!

1438
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:08,875
Bye.

1439
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,167
YAYYY!

1440
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:17,125
Hi!

1441
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:20,250
Nice place.

1442
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,917
I've been here many times.

1443
01:10:23,458 --> 01:10:24,542
Still...

1444
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:26,583
...it looks more
beautiful than before.

1445
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:29,917
And your smile is
prettier than that.

1446
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:33,000
Agreed, we shouldn't say
thanks or sorry to each other.

1447
01:10:33,292 --> 01:10:34,917
Still, you called

1448
01:10:34,917 --> 01:10:36,458
Buddy, that's awesome

1449
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Where did you guys
get these fries?

1450
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:39,958
Idiot!

1451
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:42,458
-You tell me..
-Let him be, it'll definitely work.

1452
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,333
-Hello!
-Hi..!

1453
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:05,292
Where are you?

1454
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:06,375
I'm on the way.

1455
01:11:06,417 --> 01:11:07,542
Oh, so you haven't reached yet?
-Greetings Madam!

1456
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:08,917
You did say at 4pm.

1457
01:11:09,083 --> 01:11:10,000
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

1458
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,458
I called you in regards to that.

1459
01:11:11,458 --> 01:11:13,125
I have an important
business meeting.

1460
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,708
I left the city in the morning.

1461
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:17,250
I totally forgot
about our meeting.

1462
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:19,292
I just realized looking
at the reminder.

1463
01:11:19,292 --> 01:11:20,708
I'm busy for next 3 days--

1464
01:11:20,708 --> 01:11:22,250
--so we shall meet, once
I'm back in Chennai.

1465
01:11:22,292 --> 01:11:22,958
ok?

1466
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:24,167
Hello!

1467
01:11:24,667 --> 01:11:25,875
-Hello!
-Ya..!

1468
01:11:26,667 --> 01:11:28,292
Shall we meet once I'm back?

1469
01:11:29,917 --> 01:11:31,542
-Ok.
-Bye!

1470
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,333
Mom, why are you
giving me that looks?

1471
01:11:40,625 --> 01:11:42,250
I really don't get you.

1472
01:11:42,292 --> 01:11:44,542
Why are we here for a meeting,
which not until tomorrow?

1473
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,417
It was you, who asked
him to come though

1474
01:11:46,958 --> 01:11:48,750
then you should've
met him right?

1475
01:11:48,917 --> 01:11:50,625
I'm not sure who he is exactly.

1476
01:11:50,667 --> 01:11:52,875
Me calling him to
meet seems like

1477
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,458
it happened in my dreams.

1478
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:57,792
My dear, all this ruse to
just have a cup of coffee?

1479
01:11:59,458 --> 01:12:00,667
I know, it's not required

1480
01:12:00,833 --> 01:12:05,000
but when you're confused about that
one cup of coffee, it's pointless.

1481
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:07,875
Anyways, from the looks of it

1482
01:12:07,917 --> 01:12:09,917
doesn't feel like
he's interested.

1483
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,333
What makes you say that?

1484
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:14,500
Mom, I do know about men

1485
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,125
it's been 5 minutes,
since I hung up

1486
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:17,625
By now, at least an "Hi"

1487
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:20,208
"Looking forward to see you",
he should've sent a message.

1488
01:12:20,917 --> 01:12:22,667
Look, there's nothing out here.

1489
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,750
Ah...Phew!

1490
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,875
'I totally forgot
about our meeting.'

1491
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:31,292
'I just realized looking
at the reminder.'

1492
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:41,167
Come on keep calling him.

1493
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:42,542
He's not picking up the phone.

1494
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:38,958
Oh no!

1495
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,500
What is he doing here?

1496
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:41,917
Shall I get back in?

1497
01:14:43,708 --> 01:14:44,958
Why should I be scared?

1498
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:55,125
Meghna!

1499
01:14:58,792 --> 01:15:00,375
-Hey...Hi!
-Hi.

1500
01:15:00,583 --> 01:15:01,542
What are you doing here?

1501
01:15:01,667 --> 01:15:04,333
Obviously, you just called
asked me out for a coffee.

1502
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:06,750
Then you just canceled
and left for Mumbai.

1503
01:15:06,792 --> 01:15:08,083
I felt like meeting you.

1504
01:15:08,292 --> 01:15:11,583
Oh, so you just came
all the way for that?

1505
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:13,792
Ok...

1506
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:15,583
Now that you've met me

1507
01:15:15,667 --> 01:15:16,292
what now?

1508
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:18,000
Now that I've met
you, I'm happy.

1509
01:15:18,083 --> 01:15:19,875
You said will meet after 3 days.

1510
01:15:19,917 --> 01:15:22,083
I'll wait for 3 days, once you
get back to Chennai, we'll meet.

1511
01:15:22,125 --> 01:15:22,958
Really!?

1512
01:15:23,417 --> 01:15:24,583
You came down to just say that?

1513
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,375
So what? Can't I?

1514
01:15:26,458 --> 01:15:27,917
I just felt like seeing you.

1515
01:15:29,167 --> 01:15:30,542
You're just crazy.

1516
01:15:30,708 --> 01:15:34,333
Wait, how do you know that
I'm staying right here?

1517
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,000
Aunty had updated
on the Facebook--

1518
01:15:37,042 --> 01:15:39,458
-Mommy bonding with
Meghna in Bombay.

1519
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:41,000
You're such a stalker, you know.

1520
01:15:43,292 --> 01:15:45,958
Ya! I'm on my way,
will be there on time.

1521
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,208
Fine, I really got to go now.

1522
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:49,208
I'm late for the meeting

1523
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,625
-I'll see you, Bye!
-Ya...

1524
01:15:58,208 --> 01:15:59,167
-Dev!
-Ya..

1525
01:15:59,292 --> 01:16:01,542
My work will go on for two hours

1526
01:16:01,542 --> 01:16:03,375
later I have another meeting too

1527
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:05,000
but I can take that
over the phone.

1528
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,125
Can you wait, until I get back?

1529
01:16:07,167 --> 01:16:08,750
We could probably do lunch.

1530
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,625
I've come down 1500 Kms--

1531
01:16:12,917 --> 01:16:14,708
--I can very well
wait for three hours

1532
01:16:14,792 --> 01:16:16,333
Ok, I'll see your later.

1533
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:17,083
Ya!

1534
01:16:41,958 --> 01:16:43,542
-Hello!
-I'm waiting at the lobby

1535
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:44,292
Coming...

1536
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:48,292
Dev, what's the plan?

1537
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:50,167
It's my plan, come
on will let you know.

1538
01:16:55,042 --> 01:16:55,958
Hop on!

1539
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:58,625
-On this?
-Yes, come on.

1540
01:16:58,875 --> 01:16:59,875
Ok!

1541
01:17:01,958 --> 01:17:03,042
One minute.

1542
01:17:05,125 --> 01:17:06,125
Thank you!

1543
01:17:24,083 --> 01:17:24,917
Woah!

1544
01:17:27,542 --> 01:17:29,208
Have you been to Mumbai before?

1545
01:17:29,333 --> 01:17:32,083
Quite often, there's no place in
Indian, which I haven't been to.

1546
01:17:32,208 --> 01:17:33,125
Oh!

1547
01:17:34,125 --> 01:17:37,500
So what's the count of girls, you've
impressed with your impromptu visits?

1548
01:17:38,917 --> 01:17:39,917
Come on, say it.

1549
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:45,208
It's the same as how many times you've
been impressed by guys and rode on a bike.

1550
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:48,500
Ey---what makes you think,
I'm impressed with you?

1551
01:17:49,042 --> 01:17:52,583
The same birdie which said
I was trying to impress you.

1552
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,375
I really can't win
you in a conversation.

1553
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:57,833
Do you wanna win?

1554
01:17:58,625 --> 01:17:59,250
Why?

1555
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:01,167
Just let me know, if
you wanna win, I'll lose

1556
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:02,375
After all it's you.

1557
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:06,542
You're such a flirt.

1558
01:18:07,458 --> 01:18:10,417
I'm being serious, not flirting.

1559
01:18:10,625 --> 01:18:11,625
Whatever!

1560
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:13,083
But...

1561
01:18:13,667 --> 01:18:14,833
I like this.

1562
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:23,625
This place?

1563
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:25,125
Yeah!

1564
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,542
It's too crowded.
Will we get a table?

1565
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,708
I'll take care of it.

1566
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,000
'There's no table
available, please wait.'

1567
01:18:30,042 --> 01:18:32,542
Damn it, does no one
cooks in North India too?

1568
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:34,833
Excuse me. Hello...hello,
excuse me.

1569
01:18:35,583 --> 01:18:36,583
Ah...Excuse Me!

1570
01:18:38,417 --> 01:18:39,583
Are you Mukesh Khanna?

1571
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:40,417
Dev!

1572
01:18:40,458 --> 01:18:42,000
Just wait, It'll take some time.

1573
01:18:42,375 --> 01:18:43,875
Bhai, girlfriend is waiting...

1574
01:18:43,917 --> 01:18:45,375
-I'll be there in two hours
-not a chance, please wait sir.

1575
01:18:45,417 --> 01:18:48,417
Ey---please understand
the plight of Single guys.

1576
01:18:48,875 --> 01:18:49,625
Please understand.

1577
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:51,500
What are you doing?

1578
01:18:51,542 --> 01:18:53,083
Fine, you get in, I'll handle it.

1579
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:53,917
But you're not letting us in

1580
01:18:53,958 --> 01:18:55,500
Chotu, clean the Table no.2.

1581
01:18:55,542 --> 01:18:57,208
'Come on, he's my friend.'

1582
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:57,792
Meghna!

1583
01:18:57,792 --> 01:18:59,250
Ask them to send the quotations.

1584
01:18:59,292 --> 01:18:59,958
Meghna!

1585
01:18:59,958 --> 01:19:01,125
Ya, I'll wait for the mail.

1586
01:19:02,292 --> 01:19:03,083
Just a minute.

1587
01:19:08,083 --> 01:19:09,417
Brother, excuse me!

1588
01:19:09,875 --> 01:19:11,042
Excuse me..

1589
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:13,333
Excuse me, excuse me...

1590
01:19:13,375 --> 01:19:15,250
Please come.

1591
01:19:18,583 --> 01:19:19,583
What do you like to have?

1592
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:21,500
Two Shaaks

1593
01:19:21,792 --> 01:19:23,250
Two Paneer Butter Masala

1594
01:19:23,292 --> 01:19:25,500
Lacha Paratha? Two Lacha Paratha

1595
01:19:25,542 --> 01:19:26,833
and one Egg Burji

1596
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:28,667
Listen--

1597
01:19:28,708 --> 01:19:30,333
--and that Mango Lassi

1598
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:33,333
Seems like you're really hungry.

1599
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:02,417
We're done with starters, are
you ready for the main course?

1600
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:03,417
Main Course uh?

1601
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:05,583
That's right, we never
started a conversation

1602
01:20:05,917 --> 01:20:08,333
-right here?
-No, definitely not here.

1603
01:20:10,083 --> 01:20:11,167
Wow!

1604
01:20:11,542 --> 01:20:15,708
I never knew such a
place existed in Mumbai.

1605
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,708
You always travel by flight

1606
01:20:17,708 --> 01:20:19,917
moreover you're on the
phone while traveling by car

1607
01:20:19,917 --> 01:20:20,625
Hey..!

1608
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:22,250
I was just kidding though.

1609
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,667
Why is that, you like me?

1610
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:29,083
You just caught me off guard.

1611
01:20:29,125 --> 01:20:30,583
That's my nature, can't help.

1612
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:31,542
Ok.

1613
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:33,208
I'll get used to it.

1614
01:20:34,333 --> 01:20:37,167
Actually, the reason
I like you is--

1615
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:39,167
--you look really hot.

1616
01:20:39,250 --> 01:20:41,500
Damn it, you're just
like every other guy.

1617
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:43,583
I thought, I could get
something better from you.

1618
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:46,125
So If I wasn't hot, you wouldn't
have come after me right?

1619
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,667
Woah!
Hold on! Hold on!

1620
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,000
I haven't finished talking yet.

1621
01:20:49,042 --> 01:20:51,292
Ok, ok tell me.

1622
01:20:53,583 --> 01:20:55,583
You're really hot

1623
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,583
any guy will just
melt looking at you.

1624
01:20:58,125 --> 01:21:01,792
I don't know why, that I
can't look beyond your eyes.

1625
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:03,542
That's when I realized

1626
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,417
it's not just
physical attraction

1627
01:21:06,875 --> 01:21:09,542
moreover, when I saw you

1628
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:11,542
It felt like an adventure to me.

1629
01:21:12,125 --> 01:21:13,667
I didn't want to
miss out on that.

1630
01:21:14,125 --> 01:21:16,125
That's what I believe
made me come after you.

1631
01:21:17,375 --> 01:21:18,625
This is my first time.

1632
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,792
I've had dinner
with a lot of guys

1633
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:23,000
but it's mostly as
friends or it's business.

1634
01:21:23,667 --> 01:21:26,583
But never have I ever, went
on a date with someone.

1635
01:21:28,375 --> 01:21:31,208
-You're lying
-I swear!

1636
01:21:31,833 --> 01:21:33,083
Tell me something about you.

1637
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:35,333
What do you want to know?
Ask me, I'll tell you.

1638
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:37,667
If I keep asking, then it'll
turn into an interview.

1639
01:21:37,667 --> 01:21:39,375
-So...?
-I have an idea

1640
01:21:39,417 --> 01:21:41,500
Let's take it,
we're not ourselves

1641
01:21:41,542 --> 01:21:42,208
I don't understand.

1642
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:44,042
There used to be a King--

1643
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:46,542
--and that King was called Dev.

1644
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,500
Ok, there used to be a Queen--

1645
01:21:50,583 --> 01:21:53,375
--and her name was Meghna.
-Exactly!

1646
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:56,583
That King loved adventures

1647
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,250
That Queen--

1648
01:22:00,125 --> 01:22:02,125
--she loves to make
a lot of money.

1649
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:03,042
Boring!

1650
01:22:03,042 --> 01:22:05,375
He loves to spend money.

1651
01:22:05,417 --> 01:22:07,250
Doesn't he work for a living?

1652
01:22:07,917 --> 01:22:10,542
It's the Dark Period and
the world is going to end

1653
01:22:10,542 --> 01:22:12,292
why do we have to
run behind the money

1654
01:22:12,292 --> 01:22:15,250
he wanted to make enough
and travel the world.

1655
01:22:15,375 --> 01:22:17,958
Fine, does she only
like to keep it formal?

1656
01:22:17,958 --> 01:22:18,750
No, but why?

1657
01:22:18,750 --> 01:22:21,500
Being formal, might
create distance

1658
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:22,708
Fine, then tell me dude

1659
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:23,750
Wow!

1660
01:22:23,875 --> 01:22:24,917
Ok babe!

1661
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,375
-Ey--!
-If Dude then Babe

1662
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:27,167
Ya, right!

1663
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,333
-Fine, let's go -Meghna
let's be here for a while

1664
01:22:29,375 --> 01:22:30,792
No, no, no...I have a lot to do.

1665
01:22:30,792 --> 01:22:32,542
Moreover you have to get back
to Chennai right? come on.

1666
01:22:33,042 --> 01:22:34,042
Come on!

1667
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:38,708
-Meghna!
-Ya!

1668
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:42,417
Have you done something
adventurous in your life?

1669
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:43,958
Like what?

1670
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:47,250
If I give you an idea,
would you be up for it?

1671
01:22:47,667 --> 01:22:49,500
Tell me, I'll think about it.

1672
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:52,083
I'll have to return
to Chennai, all alone

1673
01:22:53,292 --> 01:22:54,250
Can you ride with me?

1674
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:55,958
What!?
Are you crazy?

1675
01:22:55,958 --> 01:22:56,708
Come on!

1676
01:22:57,167 --> 01:23:00,625
Just met for lunch and
few words were exchanged

1677
01:23:00,667 --> 01:23:02,042
how would you know
anything about me?

1678
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:05,208
If we ride for 1500 Kms

1679
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:07,958
approximately 22
hours of journey

1680
01:23:08,292 --> 01:23:09,667
try traveling with me

1681
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:11,750
At the end of the trip--

1682
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:15,958
--at least it'll help you decide
whether to keep in touch with me.

1683
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:17,875
That's never gonna happen.

1684
01:23:17,875 --> 01:23:19,000
No ways!

1685
01:23:27,417 --> 01:23:28,792
Ok, thank you.

1686
01:23:29,125 --> 01:23:31,000
Meghna, please listen to me once

1687
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:32,000
No!

1688
01:23:32,042 --> 01:23:34,042
Meghna!
I need to talk to you.

1689
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:37,875
Do you believe in destiny?

1690
01:23:38,625 --> 01:23:39,292
Why?

1691
01:23:39,333 --> 01:23:41,875
Twenty days ago,
we were strangers

1692
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,083
but now--

1693
01:23:43,583 --> 01:23:45,792
--at least we know each
other for a Hi or Bye!

1694
01:23:46,292 --> 01:23:48,042
I've never went after a girl

1695
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:50,083
neither I had any
intentions like that

1696
01:23:50,708 --> 01:23:52,667
First time, I have
this unique feeling

1697
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:56,083
If I had taken a flight or a
private jet instead of a bike

1698
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:59,458
never did it occur to me,
I could've reached sooner.

1699
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,792
That's 'cause your thoughts
were clouded the entire ride.

1700
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:07,833
I don't know why, may be that's
why I want to get to know you.

1701
01:24:08,833 --> 01:24:10,542
I know you're interested too

1702
01:24:11,083 --> 01:24:12,625
I would love to ride with you.

1703
01:24:12,958 --> 01:24:15,042
Genuinely, with no expectations.

1704
01:24:16,792 --> 01:24:17,792
To be honest--

1705
01:24:18,667 --> 01:24:20,125
--I don't feel like
leaving without you.

1706
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:22,250
Will you ride with me?

1707
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:28,667
Let's do it.

1708
01:24:30,042 --> 01:24:32,917
It's safe, I'll reach
Chennai in two days.

1709
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:39,000
Hello, I need to talk to you.

1710
01:24:39,042 --> 01:24:39,708
Come with me.

1711
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,708
Oh no, do I have to
convince her too?

1712
01:24:44,542 --> 01:24:46,125
Aunty, you really
don't have to worry

1713
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:47,875
I'm a good guy and will
take good care of her.

1714
01:24:48,083 --> 01:24:49,083
It's not that--

1715
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:51,042
--how did you manage
to convince her?

1716
01:24:51,458 --> 01:24:52,417
Congrats!

1717
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,458
She's very stubborn though

1718
01:24:55,792 --> 01:24:57,083
but a very nice person.

1719
01:24:57,083 --> 01:24:59,333
If she ends up liking
you, won't let go off you.

1720
01:24:59,417 --> 01:25:01,750
-All the best!
-Thanks aunty, thanks.

1721
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:12,792
Meghna!
It's awesome right.

1722
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
You and I riding on a bike.

1723
01:25:15,667 --> 01:25:17,833
Smooth and Fast.

1724
01:25:18,333 --> 01:25:20,792
Actually this is my first time.

1725
01:25:21,167 --> 01:25:22,000
What about you?

1726
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:26,875
What the hell!

1727
01:25:26,917 --> 01:25:28,375
Damn it, girl.

1728
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:32,375
Hey, what happened?

1729
01:25:33,917 --> 01:25:35,250
Do you even have a conscience?

1730
01:25:35,667 --> 01:25:36,583
Why do you ask?

1731
01:25:36,625 --> 01:25:38,625
I'm riding under scorching heat

1732
01:25:38,792 --> 01:25:41,042
poor thing, can't
you speak with him?

1733
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:42,083
Ey!

1734
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:45,208
Either ways, when you got
here weren't you alone?

1735
01:25:45,417 --> 01:25:46,583
I don't know about that

1736
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:48,625
What if I'm sleepy
and ram into a vehicle?

1737
01:25:48,667 --> 01:25:50,417
Oh no!
Sorry..

1738
01:25:51,333 --> 01:25:52,542
I'll keep you company

1739
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:54,958
-Sure?
-Ya!

1740
01:25:55,208 --> 01:25:55,917
Good!

1741
01:25:57,417 --> 01:25:59,292
I read the Economic
Times this morning

1742
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:01,583
they're expecting
another recession.

1743
01:26:01,833 --> 01:26:04,250
This time we'll have to

1744
01:26:04,667 --> 01:26:06,000
Enough, stop it.

1745
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:07,458
I'll handle it from here.

01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:09,500

Meghna, wake up!

1789
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:30,417
-come outside
-Where to?

1790
01:30:30,917 --> 01:30:31,833
Just come...

1791
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:33,542
Fine, give me 10 minutes.

1792
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:41,875
Dev, where are we
going so early?

1793
01:30:41,917 --> 01:30:43,417
Ey--I think we've lost our way.

1794
01:30:43,417 --> 01:30:44,583
I know the route, don't worry.

1795
01:30:44,625 --> 01:30:46,708
I'm really scared
looking at this road.

1796
01:30:46,792 --> 01:30:48,292
Better we ask someone.

1797
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:49,542
I doubt, anyone will
be awake at this hour

1798
01:30:49,542 --> 01:30:51,083
I don't get it,
what's the hurry.

1799
01:30:51,583 --> 01:30:53,125
You trust me right?

1800
01:30:53,417 --> 01:30:55,500
I wouldn't have come along,
If I didn't trust you

1801
01:30:55,542 --> 01:30:57,833
Very Good!
Then wait for couple of minutes.

1802
01:30:57,875 --> 01:30:58,875
Ok!

1803
01:30:58,917 --> 01:31:00,625
But, what's the surprise tell me.

1804
01:31:01,167 --> 01:31:01,833
Wait!

1805
01:31:03,083 --> 01:31:03,833
One

1806
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:05,750
Two

1807
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,375
Three

1808
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:09,542
Four

1809
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,833
Wow!

1810
01:31:10,833 --> 01:31:13,667
Siberian Sparrows
are a rare sight.

1811
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:33,000
Tell me honestly

1812
01:31:33,333 --> 01:31:34,958
when did you plan this?

1813
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:38,833
I did, when I was
traveling to Mumbai.

1814
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:42,292
I hate you for this.

1815
01:31:43,042 --> 01:31:46,000
But thanks, It's
really beautiful.

1816
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:48,542
I'm traveling with the
girl I like the most

1817
01:31:49,417 --> 01:31:50,875
this is the least I could do.

1818
01:32:12,875 --> 01:32:15,417
I can't think of a
beautiful moment than this

1819
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,167
Meghna!

1820
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:20,917
I love you!

1821
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:33,250
It's getting late, let's leave.

1822
01:32:33,792 --> 01:32:34,708
Meghna!

1823
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:36,500
I said, let's leave.

1824
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,417
Was I little hasty
in proposing to her?

1825
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:07,250
She's not talking to me.

1826
01:33:07,292 --> 01:33:09,167
It's all 'cause of you.

1827
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:11,458
I made a mistake picking
you among others.

1828
01:33:13,167 --> 01:33:14,500
Still--

1829
01:33:14,708 --> 01:33:17,792
--she is still sticking
to you and hasn't left

1830
01:33:17,958 --> 01:33:19,667
Then you must've impressed her.

1831
01:33:19,792 --> 01:33:21,083
Haven't you left yet?

1832
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:23,667
That route is not safe to
travel during the night.

1833
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:24,958
I'll leave in the morning.

1834
01:33:37,458 --> 01:33:39,458
-I'm going to sleep, goodnight
-Ok, goodnight.

1835
01:33:46,792 --> 01:33:48,333
Hi...!

1836
01:34:23,792 --> 01:34:24,625
Oh shit!

1837
01:34:24,792 --> 01:34:25,958
Nirmala...Nirmala!

1838
01:34:27,792 --> 01:34:29,292
Mummy!

1839
01:34:31,375 --> 01:34:32,833
Mummy!

1840
01:34:35,542 --> 01:34:36,500
Mummy!

1841
01:34:41,542 --> 01:34:42,917
Mummy!

1842
01:34:47,083 --> 01:34:47,917
Mummy.

1843
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:49,708
Mummy! Mummy!

1844
01:34:51,542 --> 01:34:53,083
Who are you people?

1845
01:34:54,042 --> 01:34:55,292
-Nirmala! -Let go!
-Mummy!

1846
01:34:55,292 --> 01:34:56,333
Let go, damn it!

1847
01:34:56,667 --> 01:34:58,042
-Let go!
-It's hurting

1848
01:34:58,042 --> 01:34:58,958
Let go!

1849
01:34:59,708 --> 01:35:00,542
Daddy!

1850
01:35:53,458 --> 01:35:54,875
Sir, please help.

1851
01:35:54,917 --> 01:35:56,958
-Help, please
-it's hurting.

1852
01:35:58,292 --> 01:35:59,125
Sir!

1853
01:36:28,333 --> 01:36:31,708
Hello, I'm calling
from Nice Road junction

1854
01:36:31,708 --> 01:36:33,167
there has been an
accident over here

1855
01:36:33,333 --> 01:36:35,167
Can you please send an
ambulance immediately.

1856
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,250
Oh...!!!

1857
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:41,542
nothing to fear, don't cry dear.

1858
01:36:47,125 --> 01:36:47,917
Hey!

1859
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,833
They're fine, saved
by the seat belt.

1860
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:52,042
Let's go.

1861
01:36:52,250 --> 01:36:54,917
Hey---are you crazy?

1862
01:36:55,417 --> 01:36:56,875
you just started
fighting with them

1863
01:36:56,875 --> 01:37:00,750
Us, in fact if something
had happened to you?

1864
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:02,667
If it has to be, then it will

1865
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:05,542
If everyone ignores,
then who will?

1866
01:37:06,833 --> 01:37:08,583
You did the most
stupidest thing.

1867
01:37:08,625 --> 01:37:10,000
But that was the
right thing to do.

1868
01:37:10,708 --> 01:37:13,792
The kid has got a
beautiful smile.

1869
01:37:13,958 --> 01:37:17,667
I you hadn't stopped to help,
that smile would've disappeared.

1870
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:19,375
Meghna!

1871
01:37:20,500 --> 01:37:21,792
-Thanks!
-For what?

1872
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,458
For all the compliments.

1873
01:37:23,583 --> 01:37:25,625
-Ey!
-Come on, let's leave.

1874
01:37:25,875 --> 01:37:27,500
We still have 300 Kms to cover.

1875
01:37:30,917 --> 01:37:31,917
Beep.

1876
01:37:41,958 --> 01:37:43,083
See you, bye!

1877
01:37:45,542 --> 01:37:46,417
Is that all?

1878
01:37:48,542 --> 01:37:50,625
Get home before
it starts to rain

1879
01:37:53,083 --> 01:37:54,917
You never said, about
what you've decided.

1880
01:37:55,167 --> 01:37:56,167
About what?

1881
01:37:58,083 --> 01:38:01,917
Ey--I'm very genuine and
have no expectations.

1882
01:38:02,583 --> 01:38:03,583
I did say...

1883
01:38:04,542 --> 01:38:08,125
Still I need to know,
should I continue or not

1884
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:10,500
You're a good person
than I expected.

1885
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:13,333
But I'm not sure, if I love you

1886
01:38:13,542 --> 01:38:14,958
I doubt it will happen though.

1887
01:38:15,167 --> 01:38:17,167
May be we can stay friends.

1888
01:38:17,458 --> 01:38:20,042
In two weeks, I'll be
leaving to America.

1889
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:23,750
There's mobile phone, you can
text me whenever you feel Ike.

1890
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:26,292
I'll reply when I'm free.

1891
01:38:26,708 --> 01:38:27,417
Bye!

1892
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:44,208
Oh, hero!

1893
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:45,750
Are you upset?

1894
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:47,083
You're leaving me right

1895
01:38:47,083 --> 01:38:48,375
So I'm really happy.

1896
01:38:48,417 --> 01:38:49,208
Oh!

1897
01:38:49,792 --> 01:38:52,833
That means, you won't
try convincing me?

1898
01:38:52,833 --> 01:38:54,875
Love should happen naturally.

1899
01:38:54,917 --> 01:38:56,750
It should not be
forced or imposed.

1900
01:38:57,375 --> 01:39:00,667
When you have such clarity,
what is upsetting you?

1901
01:39:01,625 --> 01:39:03,167
My mind has got the clarity

1902
01:39:03,333 --> 01:39:06,125
but the pain lies
in a different zone.

1903
01:39:08,292 --> 01:39:09,250
Idiot!

1904
01:39:10,458 --> 01:39:11,958
What!?
I didn't get that.

1905
01:39:12,417 --> 01:39:13,417
Idiot!

1906
01:39:13,875 --> 01:39:15,250
Why wouldn't you call me that.

1907
01:39:18,292 --> 01:39:20,000
Can't refuse though--

1908
01:39:20,042 --> 01:39:21,708
--I've turned into a pet dog.

1909
01:39:25,833 --> 01:39:28,375
Great, whatta a timing.

1910
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:34,125
What is it?

1911
01:39:35,375 --> 01:39:39,000
Ey--why is that you don't
let me long for you?

1912
01:39:46,542 --> 01:39:49,042
Ey--will you stay
the same forever?

1913
01:39:49,625 --> 01:39:50,458
I will be.

1914
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:52,708
I'll need your
undivided attention.

1915
01:39:53,042 --> 01:39:54,333
You won't betray me right?

1916
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:55,375
I won't!

1917
01:39:56,583 --> 01:39:57,667
Tell me the truth!

1918
01:39:59,167 --> 01:40:00,625
Why do you even like me?

1919
01:40:01,083 --> 01:40:03,125
Whenever I looked at
you, I was scared.

1920
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:04,875
Eh...why?

1921
01:40:04,917 --> 01:40:07,125
Do I look like a witch to you?

1922
01:40:08,667 --> 01:40:10,750
Don't just nod, speak up.

1923
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:14,625
Before I met you

1924
01:40:15,375 --> 01:40:17,083
I was confident in
leading my life alone.

1925
01:40:18,458 --> 01:40:19,208
But now--

1926
01:40:20,333 --> 01:40:22,000
--I fear, I can't.

1927
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:25,708
I love you!

1928
01:40:27,167 --> 01:40:28,250
I love you too.

1929
01:41:25,292 --> 01:41:26,292
What is that?

1930
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:32,250
Mom!

1931
01:41:39,292 --> 01:41:40,583
Say something.

1932
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:42,333
I love you!

1933
01:41:47,667 --> 01:41:50,250
Fine, say it better

1934
01:41:51,083 --> 01:41:51,750
You!

1935
01:41:54,375 --> 01:41:55,375
Better than that--

1936
01:41:56,833 --> 01:41:57,750
Us!

1937
01:42:12,375 --> 01:42:13,375
Are you ok?

1938
01:42:18,917 --> 01:42:19,750
Oi!

1939
01:42:19,917 --> 01:42:20,708
Meghna!

1940
01:42:21,667 --> 01:42:23,667
Hey, move!
Please leave.

1941
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:25,917
I have no clue, what
you're doing to me.

1942
01:42:25,917 --> 01:42:27,458
Leave! It's better
we take it slow.

1943
01:42:27,458 --> 01:42:28,042
You first leave!

1944
01:42:28,083 --> 01:42:29,292
Ey--I won't do anything.
Let's just talk.

1945
01:42:29,333 --> 01:42:30,708
No need, just leave.

1946
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:31,750
Meghna!

1947
01:42:32,167 --> 01:42:33,833
Meghna, please trust me.

1948
01:42:33,833 --> 01:42:35,500
I totally trust you--

1949
01:42:35,542 --> 01:42:36,583
--but not me.

1950
01:42:36,625 --> 01:42:37,833
What if I do something to you?

1951
01:42:38,292 --> 01:42:39,917
At least let me stay
until the rain stops.

1952
01:42:39,958 --> 01:42:41,708
You do like nature, don't you?

1953
01:42:41,833 --> 01:42:42,458
Leave.

1954
01:42:42,667 --> 01:42:43,500
Leave!

1955
01:42:43,708 --> 01:42:44,958
Should I really?

1956
01:42:45,042 --> 01:42:45,917
Love you!

1957
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:12,375
Ey...!

1958
01:43:17,542 --> 01:43:19,125
Tell me when you trust yourself.

1959
01:43:19,417 --> 01:43:20,667
We'll cuddle and talk.

1960
01:43:21,292 --> 01:43:22,875
Bye, I love you!

1961
01:43:22,958 --> 01:43:23,708
Get lost!

1962
01:43:27,167 --> 01:43:29,417
Damn it boy, so
much has happened.

1963
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:30,333
what happened next?

1964
01:43:30,375 --> 01:43:31,375
Say, damn it!

1965
01:43:31,458 --> 01:43:32,625
Get lost, I'm shy.

1966
01:43:32,667 --> 01:43:34,625
-Blushing!
-Samosa, what's happening

1967
01:43:34,833 --> 01:43:36,208
You'll realize when
you're in love.

1968
01:43:36,583 --> 01:43:37,667
Love!? and Us?

1969
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:39,333
You never let us
out of your sight.

1970
01:43:41,292 --> 01:43:42,542
She's calling.

1971
01:43:43,042 --> 01:43:45,292
-Hi Baby!
-Hi, baby.

1972
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:46,417
What are you doing?

1973
01:43:46,583 --> 01:43:48,708
Just chilling with friends.

1974
01:43:48,875 --> 01:43:50,167
Fine, shall we meet.

1975
01:43:50,333 --> 01:43:51,875
I'm leaving out of town tonight,

1976
01:43:51,917 --> 01:43:53,208
I'll be gone for a week.

1977
01:43:53,417 --> 01:43:54,583
One week!?

1978
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,333
I'll miss you though.

1979
01:43:56,792 --> 01:43:58,417
I'll miss you too, very much.

1980
01:43:58,542 --> 01:43:59,750
Can I come along?

1981
01:44:00,083 --> 01:44:01,000
Will you?

1982
01:44:01,250 --> 01:44:02,792
Only if you have
confidence on me.

1983
01:44:03,458 --> 01:44:04,458
If not, then leave it.

1984
01:44:04,625 --> 01:44:06,542
I have full confidence on you.

1985
01:44:06,667 --> 01:44:08,375
Really?
Then I'm coming along.

1986
01:44:08,417 --> 01:44:09,583
I love you!

1987
01:44:09,583 --> 01:44:10,708
I love you, too.

1988
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,125
Love is injurious to friendship.

1989
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:16,833
I thought, will get him
hitched and get rid of him.

1990
01:44:16,875 --> 01:44:19,708
But in the end, I didn't
have company to even banter.

1991
01:44:33,042 --> 01:44:33,833
Hello!

1992
01:44:33,875 --> 01:44:35,167
Ya, ya...I'll be
there in an hour

1993
01:44:35,292 --> 01:44:36,042
Ya...Ya!

1994
01:44:36,250 --> 01:44:37,458
Dev, we're running late

1995
01:44:37,667 --> 01:44:38,875
Baby, come..

1996
01:44:38,917 --> 01:44:41,000
Hello, what are you saying?

1997
01:44:41,292 --> 01:44:42,292
I'm not gonna accept this.

1998
01:44:42,292 --> 01:44:43,458
We have the App Launch tomorrow.

1999
01:44:43,500 --> 01:44:44,875
What kind of an answer is this?

2000
01:44:45,083 --> 01:44:45,708
Ya!

2001
01:44:51,875 --> 01:44:54,417
Hello! No, no I can't
agree to this deal.

2002
01:44:54,458 --> 01:44:56,208
I've already informed
you guys right.

2003
01:44:56,208 --> 01:44:58,333
Ya, please book my stay there.

2004
01:44:58,708 --> 01:44:59,542

You're the sole reason for it.

2043
01:49:51,625 --> 01:49:54,625
No matter what happens, we
should stay happy as ever.

2044
01:49:54,958 --> 01:49:55,875
Promise!?

2045
01:49:56,417 --> 01:49:57,542
Promise!

2046
01:49:58,167 --> 01:49:59,958
By chance, if we run into
issues, what do we do?

2047
01:49:59,958 --> 01:50:01,500
Why will we have problems?

2048
01:50:01,542 --> 01:50:04,917
Every relationship
has its sour moments.

2049
01:50:05,125 --> 01:50:07,500
What if we end up
fighting in future?

2050
01:50:07,542 --> 01:50:09,625
Simple, I won't fight with you.

2051
01:50:12,125 --> 01:50:13,792
-What if you happen to fight?
-Mmmm.

2052
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:14,667
Come on!

2053
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:16,917
Fight with me.

2054
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:18,917
Ey---stop messing around

2055
01:50:20,292 --> 01:50:21,583
You were saying

2056
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:25,167
that when you look at
me, it's adventurous.

2057
01:50:25,542 --> 01:50:27,000
That's why you came after me.

2058
01:50:27,208 --> 01:50:28,292
Yes! so what now?

2059
01:50:28,292 --> 01:50:29,750
Now that I'm yours

2060
01:50:29,958 --> 01:50:31,333
adventures has ended.

2061
01:50:31,542 --> 01:50:34,292
Here on, you won't
love me the same.

2062
01:50:34,625 --> 01:50:35,708
Meghna, what's wrong with you?

2063
01:50:35,708 --> 01:50:38,458
No tell me, I need to know.

2064
01:50:39,833 --> 01:50:40,833
Ok!

2065
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:44,292
if you have to ask
me, why I love you...

2066
01:50:44,917 --> 01:50:47,042
...I can give you
a thousand reason.

2067
01:50:47,292 --> 01:50:48,500
But that's not the answer to it.

2068
01:50:49,542 --> 01:50:51,792
'Cause love can't be
constrained by words.

2069
01:50:52,125 --> 01:50:53,542
It can only be perceived.

2070
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:56,833
No, you're lying.

2071
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:59,125
I don't see truth in your eyes.

2072
01:50:59,417 --> 01:51:01,458
No one can love someone so much.

2073
01:51:01,875 --> 01:51:05,000
Moreover guys who speak
romantically can't be trusted.

2074
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:08,250
I'm a fool, who is
falling into this trap.

2075
01:51:08,500 --> 01:51:10,500
What if you abandon
me, just like my Dad.

2076
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:15,750
Do you even realize
what you're saying?

2077
01:51:16,417 --> 01:51:17,250
Ya!

2078
01:51:17,292 --> 01:51:18,542
I'm well aware of it

2079
01:51:21,333 --> 01:51:22,458
Ey--Dev!

2080
01:51:22,583 --> 01:51:23,292
What happened?

2081
01:51:23,333 --> 01:51:24,458
-Let me go
-Where are you going?

2082
01:51:25,417 --> 01:51:26,250
Dev!

2083
01:51:26,625 --> 01:51:28,042
Thanks for hurting me.

2084
01:51:28,042 --> 01:51:30,333
Please come on, I was
just kidding with you.

2085
01:51:30,958 --> 01:51:32,292
No, you're lying.

2086
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:34,375
You still don't trust me.

2087
01:51:35,042 --> 01:51:37,042
and I'm not sure If I
can get you to trust me

2088
01:51:37,542 --> 01:51:38,208
There's no point.

2089
01:51:38,250 --> 01:51:40,167
Dev, please!
Please listen to me.

2090
01:51:44,292 --> 01:51:46,292
Dev...please.

2091
01:52:01,125 --> 01:52:03,500
Baby! Why are you crying!

2092
01:52:04,208 --> 01:52:06,667
Who the hell is that guy?
Seems too lewd.

2093
01:52:07,542 --> 01:52:08,167
Hello!

2094
01:52:08,458 --> 01:52:09,958
Mind your own business.

2095
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:11,917
This is between me
and my boyfriend.

2096
01:52:11,917 --> 01:52:13,167
Did you say boyfriend?

2097
01:52:13,292 --> 01:52:14,125
And that guy?

2098
01:52:14,250 --> 01:52:16,542
Damn, you have a very bad taste.

2099
01:52:16,833 --> 01:52:18,500
You look really hot.

2100
01:52:18,500 --> 01:52:20,292
Let him go, you can
find someone better.

2101
01:52:20,333 --> 01:52:22,417
Hello, mind your
own business, ok.

2102
01:52:22,458 --> 01:52:23,292
Ok!

2103
01:52:24,250 --> 01:52:24,875
Ey!

2104
01:52:24,917 --> 01:52:25,625
-Stop there
-Hey!

2105
01:52:25,667 --> 01:52:27,125
How dare you leave me.

2106
01:52:27,125 --> 01:52:28,833
Bloody wearing
glasses in the dark

2107
01:52:30,583 --> 01:52:31,958
-Bloody, bear it
-It's hurting

2108
01:52:33,083 --> 01:52:35,333
I'm the only one for
you in this life.

2109
01:52:36,208 --> 01:52:37,208
Is that so?

2110
01:52:37,667 --> 01:52:38,500
Yes!

2111
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,917
Be careful, I came
back this time--

2112
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,708
--I won't do the same again.

2113
01:52:42,958 --> 01:52:45,208
Why? are you so egoistic?

2114
01:52:45,250 --> 01:52:47,708
Doesn't matter, if you
don't I'll come for you.

2115
01:52:47,875 --> 01:52:50,083
I've never trusted a man before.

2116
01:52:51,208 --> 01:52:52,625
Wish to continue the same.

2117
01:52:52,625 --> 01:52:53,625
Except for you.

2118
01:52:54,792 --> 01:52:56,333
Don't leave me!

2119
01:53:08,875 --> 01:53:10,458
Will you hold on to this for me?

2120
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,792
Whenever you have
doubts about me

2121
01:53:22,333 --> 01:53:23,500
ask my Mom

2122
01:53:24,042 --> 01:53:25,208
She'll tell you.

2123
01:53:25,792 --> 01:53:27,250
How much I love you.

2124
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,750
"Love" is a crazy feeling.

2125
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,625
Since we got our sixth sense--

2126
01:53:39,667 --> 01:53:41,625
--we think a tad bit
much than required.

2127
01:53:42,167 --> 01:53:44,250
'It gets bitter, if you just
stay happy without any issue'

2128
01:53:44,375 --> 01:53:47,250
if you force an issue,
it'll grab you strong.'

2129
01:53:47,250 --> 01:53:48,750
Can it be more creative?

2130
01:53:48,792 --> 01:53:50,542
Oh God, that's a great design.

2131
01:53:50,583 --> 01:53:51,625
Only you have doubts about it.

2132
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:52,500
Dev!

2133
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:54,125
come here for a bit.

2134
01:53:55,542 --> 01:53:57,833
This is the design of
our upcoming store.

2135
01:53:57,875 --> 01:53:59,750
I really like this design.

2136
01:53:59,750 --> 01:54:02,667
But none of them seem
to like this design.

2137
01:54:02,667 --> 01:54:04,333
Why don't you tell me how is it?

2138
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:07,250
-Do you have other options?
-Yes sir, this one.

2139
01:54:13,292 --> 01:54:15,625
-Can we try another option?
-Sure we can, sir.

2140
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Give me a pencil.

2141
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,167
-What's the measurement of our site?
- 1/2 Acre, Sir.

2142
01:54:22,208 --> 01:54:24,667
Frontage will be 120/180.

2143
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:28,167
-What about FSI?
-FSI will be around 2.

2144
01:54:41,292 --> 01:54:43,208
Wow, that looks great.

2145
01:54:43,333 --> 01:54:44,708
Dad, this is just an idea.

2146
01:54:44,708 --> 01:54:47,500
If we reduce the footprint
and construct it elevated--

2147
01:54:47,500 --> 01:54:48,750
--we'll get more parking space.

2148
01:54:48,833 --> 01:54:50,458
Our site is at a
4 road junction.

2149
01:54:50,708 --> 01:54:52,000
It'll be already cluttered.

2150
01:54:52,042 --> 01:54:55,292
Such an architecture will
become an landmark itself.

2151
01:54:56,125 --> 01:54:57,708
It'll attract youngsters too.

2152
01:54:58,500 --> 01:55:00,833
-Do as he says.
-Ok, Sir.

2153
01:55:01,292 --> 01:55:04,750
Son, is it possible for you to
take care of this construction?

2154
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:10,750
Ok, Dad.

2155
01:55:11,375 --> 01:55:12,083
Thank you!

2156
01:55:12,083 --> 01:55:13,333
-You guys carry on
-Sure.

2157
01:55:13,333 --> 01:55:14,250
'Just as I wished

2158
01:55:14,292 --> 01:55:16,083
-Ritu, keep this design as reference.
--your Dad agreed too

2159
01:55:16,125 --> 01:55:18,125
-we need to get a approval by tomorrow
afternoon. -You can't evade now

2160
01:55:19,958 --> 01:55:20,833
Dad!

2161
01:55:21,333 --> 01:55:22,833
I need to talk to you.

2162
01:55:22,875 --> 01:55:24,083
Please come in, son.

2163
01:55:27,250 --> 01:55:30,167
Dad, I'm in love with a girl.

2164
01:55:35,458 --> 01:55:36,542
Her name is Meghna.

2165
01:55:37,417 --> 01:55:38,500
She's a very good girl.

2166
01:55:38,750 --> 01:55:41,500
Raised by a single
mom, lives in USA.

2167
01:55:42,167 --> 01:55:43,792
She runs her own company.

2168
01:55:44,292 --> 01:55:45,958
I like her to be
part of our family.

2169
01:55:46,125 --> 01:55:48,000
I'm very happy, son.

2170
01:55:48,542 --> 01:55:50,708
If you mom was alive, she
would've celebrated it.

2171
01:55:51,667 --> 01:55:52,500
Cute!

2172
01:55:53,042 --> 01:55:54,167
What's your next plan?

2173
01:55:54,833 --> 01:55:57,083
I would love to take
care of our business.

2174
01:55:57,667 --> 01:55:59,958
Still, I'll be here---

2175
01:56:00,208 --> 01:56:02,125
---and she'll be over there. No
idea how it's gonna work out.

2176
01:56:04,125 --> 01:56:07,500
I feel it might be tough for
her, If I'm not with her.

2177
01:56:07,792 --> 01:56:09,208
She's a very good girl.

2178
01:56:09,667 --> 01:56:11,333
She went through a lot
during her childhood.

2179
01:56:12,167 --> 01:56:14,167
Whenever she's with
me, she feels happy.

2180
01:56:14,833 --> 01:56:16,833
I don't want to disappoint her.

2181
01:56:16,833 --> 01:56:18,625
You speak just like your mother.

2182
01:56:20,042 --> 01:56:22,958
Don't fear in doing
something, which you love.

2183
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:24,792
Doesn't matter what it is.

2184
01:56:25,875 --> 01:56:29,375
It's not imperative you have to
take care of family business.

2185
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:31,625
So what if you guys
can't be with me

2186
01:56:31,750 --> 01:56:33,000
I'll be with you guys.

2187
01:56:37,375 --> 01:56:38,375
Thank you, Dad.

2188
01:56:39,167 --> 01:56:39,833
Dad!

2189
01:56:40,208 --> 01:56:42,333
I'll take care of the construction
of our upcoming store.

2190
01:56:42,708 --> 01:56:44,667
Thank you. That's fine--

2191
01:56:45,208 --> 01:56:47,167
--when do I get
to meet the girl?

2192
01:56:48,125 --> 01:56:50,958
She's quite busy at the moment.
I'll invite her to our Bhoomi Poojai.

2193
01:56:51,250 --> 01:56:53,042
-Good, get her.
-Bye!

2194
01:56:58,167 --> 01:56:59,250
Hi baby!

2195
01:57:00,167 --> 01:57:01,625
-Hi baby!
-Where are you?

2196
01:57:02,417 --> 01:57:03,083
Jogging!

2197
01:57:03,125 --> 01:57:04,833
Oh great! Our
flight is at 06:45

2198
01:57:04,875 --> 01:57:07,875
It's 2 now, get ready.
I'll come and pick you up.

2199
01:57:07,917 --> 01:57:10,875
Baby, boys are bound
to pick up girls.

2200
01:57:10,917 --> 01:57:12,917
-So...I'll come
-Ok.

2201
01:57:22,083 --> 01:57:22,667
Hello!

2202
01:57:22,708 --> 01:57:24,625
Good Afternoon Sir, this
is Murthy architect.

2203
01:57:24,625 --> 01:57:25,542
Tell me, Murthy.

2204
01:57:25,542 --> 01:57:28,625
Would you be able to come
down at 6pm at the site?

2205
01:57:28,875 --> 01:57:30,708
only 4 days are left
for Bhoomi Poojai.

2206
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:32,542
if you approve the
design, it'll be great.

2207
01:57:32,542 --> 01:57:34,292
I have a flight to catch at 6:45.

2208
01:57:34,542 --> 01:57:36,375
Can we meet at 3:30?

2209
01:57:37,667 --> 01:57:40,000
Sir, we discussed a design,
but you've done the opposite.

2210
01:57:40,125 --> 01:57:41,500
This is not the plan I designed.

2211
01:57:41,542 --> 01:57:44,000
Sorry Sir, that's why we
came for a clarification.

2212
01:57:44,167 --> 01:57:46,625
If you sit with us for
few hours, we can do it.

2213
01:57:46,792 --> 01:57:48,500
I have a flight in an hour.

2214
01:57:51,458 --> 01:57:52,833
Baby have you left?

2215
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:56,000
I'm stuck in a situation,
there's a small issue.

2216
01:57:56,208 --> 01:57:58,000
-Hey are you ok?
-Ya, ya I'm ok.

2217
01:57:58,208 --> 01:58:01,292
Baby, you please carry on.
I don't think I can join you.

2218
01:58:01,583 --> 01:58:03,417
-Is it ok?
-Ok!

2219
01:58:03,583 --> 01:58:05,208
-Sorry uh, bye.
-Bye!

2220
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:06,292
I'll call you back, bye.

2221
01:58:08,833 --> 01:58:11,000
-All is well?
-Mmm...Ya!

2222
01:58:11,375 --> 01:58:12,917
He's trying to prank me,
that he can't make it.

2223
01:58:12,958 --> 01:58:15,500
But he'll surprise me
being at the airport.

2224
01:58:20,542 --> 01:58:21,125
Hi baby!

2225
01:58:21,125 --> 01:58:22,333
Baby where are you?

2226
01:58:22,625 --> 01:58:24,625
Didn't I mention, that
I was stuck with work.

2227
01:58:24,708 --> 01:58:25,417
Oh!

2228
01:58:25,667 --> 01:58:28,958
Ok travel safe, take care. Bye.

2229
01:58:29,208 --> 01:58:31,500
'What exactly is he busy with?'

2230
01:58:35,917 --> 01:58:38,167
'No calls neither a text---

2231
01:58:38,708 --> 01:58:40,167

-Hi baby!

What happened to you?
Where are you?

2243
01:59:14,125 --> 01:59:17,625
Mmmm, I'm preparing
a surprise for you.

2244
01:59:17,875 --> 01:59:20,917
I don't want any
surprises, I just want you.

2245
01:59:20,917 --> 01:59:23,750
If all the girls remain like
you, boys won't have any issues.

2246

Fine baby, I'll finish my
work and call you back.

2247

- Ok bye.
-Hey wait..

2248
01:59:27,708 --> 01:59:28,875
Have you told her yet?

2249
01:59:28,958 --> 01:59:30,042
I haven't yet.

the mall carries her name.'

-Hey, Hi!

2255
01:59:48,125 --> 01:59:50,167
Baby, I'll call you back later.
Bye.

Hey, what's all this?

2257
02:00:14,917 --> 02:00:16,542
Ey--what's wrong with you?

2258
02:00:16,542 --> 02:00:17,792
Why are you making me
miss you like this?

2259
02:00:17,792 --> 02:00:19,417
It's all a ruse to
give you a surprise.

2260
02:00:19,708 --> 02:00:20,958
What's the surprise?

2261
02:00:21,208 --> 02:00:22,417
-Come on
-Hey, where are we going?

2262
02:00:22,958 --> 02:00:24,917
-Welcome. -Tell me, Dev
-I'll tell you, wait.

2263
02:00:25,208 --> 02:00:28,083
-Ok fine, tell me where we're going
-Don't rush, we're going there.

2264
02:00:28,292 --> 02:00:29,875
Ok, fine.

2265
02:00:30,458 --> 02:00:31,833
Ta-Da!

2266
02:00:32,792 --> 02:00:34,083
-Welcome, Sir.
-Hi!

2267
02:00:34,083 --> 02:00:36,750
How's it?
Meghna Mall.

2268
02:00:36,958 --> 02:00:38,250
Do you know, who designed it?

2269
02:00:38,458 --> 02:00:39,417
Who did?

2270
02:00:39,583 --> 02:00:40,667
Keep guessing.

2271
02:00:41,208 --> 02:00:43,333
You gotta meet
someone, I'll be back.

2272
02:00:43,375 --> 02:00:44,292
I'll be back.

2273
02:00:46,792 --> 02:00:48,042
You should eat everything
without wasting it

2274
02:00:48,042 --> 02:00:49,750
Dad, Meghna is here.

2275
02:00:50,208 --> 02:00:51,750
Is that so, hey come over here.

2276
02:00:51,750 --> 02:00:52,500
That's a good design.

2277
02:00:52,542 --> 02:00:54,042
Ma'am, all this is done by him.

2278
02:00:54,333 --> 02:00:57,000
There's no chance, someone
can do so much in just 5 days.

2279
02:00:57,042 --> 02:01:00,542
He didn’t think about anything
else but was focused on work

2280
02:01:00,667 --> 02:01:02,917
At this rate, the business
he's going to take over

2281
02:01:02,917 --> 02:01:05,042
no one can compete with him.

2282
02:01:05,083 --> 02:01:06,583
He has spoken about you.

2283
02:01:06,625 --> 02:01:07,875
You're very lucky.

2284
02:01:08,083 --> 02:01:10,083
Big family, and he's a good man.

2285
02:01:12,667 --> 02:01:14,667
-Where is she?
-She was right here

2286
02:01:15,875 --> 02:01:17,042
Sorry sir, I got late

2287
02:01:17,083 --> 02:01:17,625
Welcome!

2288
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:20,458
Brother, it's getting
late for Poojai, let's go.

2289
02:01:21,167 --> 02:01:22,542
-Let's go...
-You carry on Dad, I'll get her

2290
02:01:22,583 --> 02:01:24,625
-Please, welcome.
-I'll come, aunty...

2291
02:01:44,667 --> 02:01:45,375
Hello!

2292
02:01:45,583 --> 02:01:47,000
Meghna, where are you?

2293
02:01:47,042 --> 02:01:48,083
I left.

2294
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:49,458
Why, what happened?

2295
02:01:49,458 --> 02:01:51,292
Was this building your surprise?

2296
02:01:51,333 --> 02:01:52,292
Yes!

2297
02:01:52,333 --> 02:01:55,000
Is this why you didn't
speak to me for 36 hours?

2298
02:01:55,875 --> 02:01:57,167
Without speaking...

2299
02:01:57,208 --> 02:01:58,500
Which 36 hours?

2300
02:01:58,542 --> 02:02:00,917
The four days, where you
didn't think about me.

2301
02:02:01,083 --> 02:02:02,667
The time you avoided me.

2302
02:02:02,833 --> 02:02:04,583
I never avoided you.

2303
02:02:04,583 --> 02:02:07,000
In 4 days, at least
over the phone

2304
02:02:07,042 --> 02:02:08,750
had you spent 2 hours with me?

2305
02:02:08,875 --> 02:02:10,083
Is that a surprise too?

2306
02:02:10,292 --> 02:02:11,833
What were up to the
rest of the time?

2307
02:02:12,292 --> 02:02:14,250
I was taking care of the
construction over here.

2308
02:02:14,292 --> 02:02:14,958
Oh!

2309
02:02:15,125 --> 02:02:17,125
What's with the sudden
interest in construction?

2310
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:18,917
First time, Dad
asked me something.

2311
02:02:19,125 --> 02:02:20,208
How can I refuse.

2312
02:02:20,208 --> 02:02:23,250
Fine, how long will you
be busy with construction?

2313
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:26,708
May be until it's
over, take it 6 months.

2314
02:02:27,042 --> 02:02:28,083
Then, what about me?

2315
02:02:28,458 --> 02:02:29,458
My time with you?

2316
02:02:29,583 --> 02:02:32,333
Meghna, I'm not going to
do business my entire life.

2317
02:02:32,375 --> 02:02:35,167
Dev, don't teach
me about business.

2318
02:02:35,333 --> 02:02:37,375
I very well know, what
will happen once you begin.

2319
02:02:37,417 --> 02:02:39,083
That's the reason, I was
scared all this while.

2320
02:02:39,208 --> 02:02:41,375
That's why, I kept asking
you again and again.

2321
02:02:42,750 --> 02:02:44,750
The reason I like you was--

2322
02:02:44,792 --> 02:02:48,250
--that you'll around always
and will spend time with me.

2323
02:02:48,292 --> 02:02:50,417
Baby, let everything go.

2324
02:02:51,125 --> 02:02:53,125
Hereafter, I won't
do any such thing--

2325
02:02:53,458 --> 02:02:55,333
--and will be only around you.
Promise me that.

2326
02:02:55,375 --> 02:02:56,708
I'll take care of you.

2327
02:02:57,792 --> 02:02:59,167
What do you mean by that?

2328
02:03:00,333 --> 02:03:01,125
I don't get it

2329
02:03:01,167 --> 02:03:03,167
It's enough, if you're with me.

2330
02:03:03,208 --> 02:03:05,042
What you did in
these past 28 years--

2331
02:03:05,125 --> 02:03:07,417
--I want you to do the same
with me for next 50 years

2332
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,792
No matter what happens, you
never took anything seriously

2333
02:03:11,833 --> 02:03:13,417
and enjoyed your life.

2334
02:03:13,458 --> 02:03:15,708
Baby, you're very unique.

2335
02:03:15,792 --> 02:03:17,208
That's why I chose you.

2336
02:03:18,208 --> 02:03:19,292
You chose me?

2337
02:03:20,708 --> 02:03:21,667
Am I a product to you?

2338
02:03:21,708 --> 02:03:23,583
You've been talking just
about you all this while

2339
02:03:23,833 --> 02:03:25,000
doesn't it sound selfish to you?

2340
02:03:25,333 --> 02:03:27,667
Oh, is this called
being selfish?

2341
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:29,792
Then if a girl is good looking,

2342
02:03:29,792 --> 02:03:31,458
being with her is an adventure

2343
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:33,083
if I get married, she'll
be good homemaker.

2344
02:03:33,125 --> 02:03:34,083
Will cook for me

2345
02:03:34,125 --> 02:03:36,958
and have my babies. Don't you
guys expect this from a girl?

2346
02:03:37,000 --> 02:03:38,000
What do you call that?

2347
02:03:38,125 --> 02:03:39,333
I am selfish!

2348
02:03:40,083 --> 02:03:43,792
I chose something which
will make me happy in life

2349
02:03:44,208 --> 02:03:46,208
there's no harm being
selfish about it.

2350
02:03:46,208 --> 02:03:49,583
Meghna, not all
men are the same.

2351
02:03:49,708 --> 02:03:51,208
If you wish to be,
then be selfish.

2352
02:03:51,833 --> 02:03:54,708
But love is something, which
not only concerns you--

2353
02:03:55,083 --> 02:03:56,208
--but it concerns me as well.

2354
02:03:56,750 --> 02:03:59,917
If you're around it's enough and your
happiness is what matters. You said this.

2355
02:03:59,958 --> 02:04:01,542
Now you're being a
different person.

2356
02:04:01,708 --> 02:04:06,417
In the name of adventure, you do
something interesting on and off.

2357
02:04:06,708 --> 02:04:09,500
So...the same thing is
done by many though.

2358
02:04:09,833 --> 02:04:13,000
You haven't done
squat to be proud of.

2359
02:04:13,333 --> 02:04:14,625
What are you trying to get at?

2360
02:04:14,958 --> 02:04:16,500
That I am a nobody.

2361
02:04:17,333 --> 02:04:20,625
You're asking me to be in your
control and listen to you.

2362
02:04:21,250 --> 02:04:23,750
If so, then all this
while you never loved me.

2363
02:04:23,792 --> 02:04:25,250
Yes, I didn't love you.

2364
02:04:25,958 --> 02:04:27,083
I trusted you--

2365
02:04:27,125 --> 02:04:29,333
--there's no use in talking anymore.
Good Bye.

2366
02:04:30,833 --> 02:04:33,792
Meghna, why are you
fighting like this?

2367
02:04:34,250 --> 02:04:34,958
Hello!

2368
02:04:35,167 --> 02:04:36,583
Hello!
Meghna!

2369
02:04:41,625 --> 02:04:43,375
Ey--what happened?
Why are you so angry?

2370
02:04:43,500 --> 02:04:44,542
Why are you crying?

2371
02:04:45,458 --> 02:04:46,708
I won't cry anymore.

2372
02:04:46,958 --> 02:04:49,458
I've booked tickets, we're
returning right away.

2373
02:04:49,917 --> 02:04:51,167
Hey, hey Meghna.

2374
02:04:51,333 --> 02:04:52,292
What happened?

2375
02:04:52,333 --> 02:04:54,500
Meghna, what is this?

2376
02:04:54,750 --> 02:04:56,042
Tell me what happened?

2377
02:04:56,083 --> 02:04:57,375
I'm out of this relationship.

2378
02:04:57,417 --> 02:04:58,792
-This won't work out.
-Why?

2379
02:04:58,792 --> 02:05:00,667
-It won't work out.
-Tell me why, damn it

2380
02:05:00,875 --> 02:05:03,000
He can't give me
the time I require

2381
02:05:03,083 --> 02:05:05,583
It's enough we got betrayed
in the name of Dad.

2382
02:05:06,167 --> 02:05:07,750
I don't want to get
betrayed once again.

2383
02:05:08,042 --> 02:05:09,167
Don't act in haste, Meghna.

2384
02:05:09,208 --> 02:05:10,250
Let's sit down and talk.

2385
02:05:10,292 --> 02:05:12,042
He's a very good guy.

2386
02:05:12,333 --> 02:05:13,958
I don't need anyone, anymore.

2387
02:05:14,500 --> 02:05:16,125
Meghna, please listen to me.

2388
02:05:16,667 --> 02:05:18,542
Are you coming with me or not?

2389
02:05:25,833 --> 02:05:26,625
Meghna!

2390
02:05:27,083 --> 02:05:28,083
Meghna!

2391
02:05:37,917 --> 02:05:38,667
Meghna!

2392
02:05:38,792 --> 02:05:39,750
Meghna!

2393
02:05:41,417 --> 02:05:42,417
Meghna!

2394
02:05:44,958 --> 02:05:46,375
Meghna, I'm sorry.

2395
02:05:47,375 --> 02:05:49,375
Whatever it is we can sort
it out, please stop the car.

2396
02:05:49,417 --> 02:05:52,167
-Please!
-Just hear him out

2397
02:06:36,583 --> 02:06:37,333
Mr.Ramalingam!

2398
02:06:37,375 --> 02:06:38,083
How's my son?

2399
02:06:38,125 --> 02:06:40,042
there are 4 fractures,
it's critical though.

2400
02:06:40,083 --> 02:06:41,542
I think he needs
someone with him now.

2401
02:06:42,125 --> 02:06:43,250
You guys wait here.

2402
02:07:02,375 --> 02:07:03,542
Sorry, Dad.

2403
02:07:04,708 --> 02:07:06,708
I'm hurting you guys a lot.

2404
02:07:07,417 --> 02:07:10,167
I did all this, so that
she doesn't have to worry.

2405
02:07:11,208 --> 02:07:12,958
The name of our daughter--

2406
02:07:14,083 --> 02:07:16,542
--also the name of our
son, we had decided it.

2407
02:07:18,042 --> 02:07:19,167
Without her--

2408
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,042
--she knows very well,
that I can't live.

2409
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:30,208
Still she was ignorant and left.

2410
02:07:32,417 --> 02:07:34,875
Along with it, she
took my life too.

2411
02:07:39,208 --> 02:07:41,583
Before she disappeared
from my sight---

2412
02:07:42,375 --> 02:07:43,958
---I felt like killing myself.

2413
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Dev...!

2414
02:07:46,375 --> 02:07:47,125
Dev.

2415
02:07:48,125 --> 02:07:50,125
I understand your
pain very well.

2416
02:07:50,583 --> 02:07:53,333
I was in the same state as
yours, when your mother died.

2417
02:07:54,167 --> 02:07:56,083
That time, you guys
were there for me.

2418
02:07:56,292 --> 02:07:57,875
Now, I'm there for you.

2419
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:00,833
I'm not sure, what she
did was right or wrong?

2420
02:08:00,875 --> 02:08:03,167
But I'm sure, I raised you well.

2421
02:08:05,542 --> 02:08:08,333
No matter what is your decision,
I'll support you on that.

2422
02:08:10,875 --> 02:08:13,417
But I can't bear another loss.

2423
02:08:13,958 --> 02:08:15,792
This smile is your identity.

2424
02:08:17,083 --> 02:08:18,958
This is where I see your mother.

2425
02:08:21,208 --> 02:08:23,625
Please don't lose
this at any cost.

2426
02:08:32,333 --> 02:08:33,208
Mom!

2427
02:08:33,708 --> 02:08:35,458
Mom, please open the door.

2428
02:08:35,500 --> 02:08:37,167
Why are you so angry with me?

2429
02:08:37,292 --> 02:08:38,667
As it is he hurt me--

2430
02:08:39,083 --> 02:08:40,583
--why are you hurting me more?

2431
02:08:41,875 --> 02:08:44,000
I thought you'll change
if a man enters your life

2432
02:08:44,167 --> 02:08:46,083
but when I saw you not
respecting any relationship

2433
02:08:46,125 --> 02:08:47,708
there's no point in talking.

2434
02:08:53,958 --> 02:08:55,333
Were you asleep?

2435
02:08:58,417 --> 02:08:58,958
No!

2436
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:00,875
Brother, what is your name?

2437
02:09:01,417 --> 02:09:02,083
Dev!

2438
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,958
Fine, tell me how
did you get hurt?

2439
02:09:03,958 --> 02:09:05,458
You've been hurt really bad.

2440
02:09:05,708 --> 02:09:08,125
I fell, when I was trying
to climb a mountain.

2441
02:09:08,125 --> 02:09:09,667
Oh so you can climb a mountain?

2442
02:09:10,625 --> 02:09:11,542
-Super!
-Mmmm.

2443
02:09:11,542 --> 02:09:12,667
What is your name?

2444
02:09:12,667 --> 02:09:14,458
I'm Meenakshi, and she's Dora.

2445
02:09:15,208 --> 02:09:16,917
My mother's name
is Meenakshi too.

2446
02:09:17,167 --> 02:09:19,167
-Oh is it?
-Mmmm.

2447
02:09:20,042 --> 02:09:24,083
Dora and I are not liking
it in this hospital.

2448
02:09:24,125 --> 02:09:28,875
So we're planning to climb
a mountain and hide there.

2449
02:09:29,292 --> 02:09:32,750
But she's very scared of fox.

2450
02:09:32,958 --> 02:09:35,417
Is it possible for
you to take us along?

2451
02:09:36,667 --> 02:09:37,958
Promise!?

2452
02:09:40,083 --> 02:09:41,250
Promise.

2453
02:09:42,125 --> 02:09:43,625
What the hell is going on?

2454
02:09:44,083 --> 02:09:46,083
Why is the team
being so incompetent?

2455
02:09:46,417 --> 02:09:49,292
Just 'cause I'm not here,
why there is no progress?

2456
02:09:52,292 --> 02:09:54,125
-Ma'am
-What!?

2457
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:57,625
They've selected you as the "Best
Asian business leader", this year.

2458
02:09:57,667 --> 02:09:59,750
The award ceremony is
happening in Singapore.

Hey, we've been searching
for you everywhere.

2469
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Buddy, why are you
torturing yourself?

2470
02:10:55,833 --> 02:10:58,000
I thought I was very strong.

2471
02:10:59,708 --> 02:11:01,375
Didn't realize, it
will hurt so much.

2472
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Buddy, please don't cry.

2473

Can't see you in this state

2474
02:11:05,708 --> 02:11:07,583
Firstly, go and get her.

2475
02:11:08,542 --> 02:11:11,208
There's nothing new
to mention anymore.

2476
02:11:12,583 --> 02:11:13,917
But I know---

2477
02:11:15,083 --> 02:11:16,792
---she'll definitely come back.

2478
02:11:17,167 --> 02:11:18,875
what if she doesn't?

2479
02:11:24,125 --> 02:11:26,000
Dev, come on let's play.

2480
02:11:31,292 --> 02:11:33,458
Harish, am I a bad person?

2481
02:11:33,500 --> 02:11:36,083
You...are not a
bad person though

2482
02:11:36,292 --> 02:11:38,958
But you consider
only your opinions.

2483
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:40,708
So, are you calling me selfish?

2484
02:11:40,750 --> 02:11:41,625
Aren't you?

2485
02:11:42,333 --> 02:11:46,167

'Will you the stay
the same forever?'

2608
02:27:14,875 --> 02:27:16,750
'You won't abandon me, right?'

2609
02:28:12,208 --> 02:28:12,917
Dev!

2610
02:28:13,958 --> 02:28:14,958
Are you alright?

2611
02:28:16,417 --> 02:28:17,583
Don't you have any sense?

2612
02:28:18,042 --> 02:28:19,833
You climbed up so
high without oxygen

2613
02:28:19,875 --> 02:28:21,167
you could've died.

2614
02:28:21,833 --> 02:28:22,833
Officer---

2615
02:28:23,083 --> 02:28:25,000
---ensure that he's
attended to immediately.

2616
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:27,083
-Ok Sir!
-With all the necessary first aid.

2617
02:28:48,875 --> 02:28:50,042
Are you a fool?

2618
02:28:50,625 --> 02:28:52,750
What if something
had happened to you?

2619
02:28:55,417 --> 02:28:57,417
It's all 'cause of her.

2620
02:28:58,708 --> 02:29:00,375
You don't need her anymore.

2621
02:29:00,708 --> 02:29:02,708
I'm here for you now.

2622
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:07,000
No...

2623
02:29:08,708 --> 02:29:09,958
...I don't need you.

2624
02:29:11,333 --> 02:29:12,667
I only need her.

2625
02:29:12,875 --> 02:29:15,125
Ey--she's an arrogant woman.

2626
02:29:15,583 --> 02:29:17,000
But, I'm not like her.

2627
02:29:17,250 --> 02:29:18,875
I'm really sweet.

2628
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
I can't live without her.

2629
02:29:25,417 --> 02:29:27,042
She feels the same too.

2630
02:29:28,500 --> 02:29:30,125
Then why did she leave you?

2631
02:29:33,083 --> 02:29:34,375
We let go--

2632
02:29:35,792 --> 02:29:37,042
--so that we can return.

2633
02:29:43,333 --> 02:29:44,833
You never change, do you?

2634
02:29:47,083 --> 02:29:47,833
I won't!

2635
02:29:59,167 --> 02:30:00,500
I love you!

2636
02:30:02,167 --> 02:30:03,333
I love you too.

2637
02:30:14,250 --> 02:30:17,875
'In the end, she returned
just as Dev had mentioned.'

2638
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:21,458
'If you ask, how you stay
positive no matter what happens?'

2639
02:30:21,625 --> 02:30:22,917
'He said one thing'

2640
02:30:23,583 --> 02:30:27,875
'Buddy, there's no confusion
in how to lead a life

2641
02:30:27,917 --> 02:30:30,708
it's enough if you just
listen to your heart.'

2642
02:30:30,917 --> 02:30:34,375
'Your heart always lets
you know your choices.'

2643
02:30:34,375 --> 02:30:35,917
Just go with the flow!

2644
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:50,625
