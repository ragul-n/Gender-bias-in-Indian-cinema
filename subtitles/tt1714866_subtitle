1
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:31,603
l was born in the city of
Bombay, once upon a time.

2
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:39,349
At the precise instant of
lndia's arrival at independence...

3
00:00:39,684 --> 00:00:44,314
...on the stroke of midnight,
l tumbled forth into the world.

4
00:00:47,458 --> 00:00:52,760
l, Saleem Sinai, was mysteriously
handcuffed to history.

5
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,457
My destiny,
forever chained to my country's.

6
00:00:57,768 --> 00:00:59,861
And l couldn't even
wipe my own nose...

7
00:00:59,937 --> 00:01:01,199
...at the time.

8
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:13,846
Most of what matters in our
lives takes place in our absence;

9
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,382
and my life really began on the
shore of the Dal Lake in Kashmir...

10
00:01:19,724 --> 00:01:22,488
more than 30 years
before l was born.

11
00:01:26,664 --> 00:01:29,656
The central feature of
my grandfather's anatomy...

12
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,302
...was his magnificent nose.

13
00:01:47,785 --> 00:01:49,412
Doctor Aziz.

14
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,211
Good morning, Ghani Sahib.
- Good morning.

15
00:01:54,425 --> 00:01:57,553
Now that our own
lady doctor is sick...

16
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,289
...you, Doctor Aziz, get the
opportunity and she gets the sack.

17
00:02:01,866 --> 00:02:03,891
Big chance for you, young man.
- Yes, sir.

18
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:05,260
l've heard nice things about you.

19
00:02:05,603 --> 00:02:08,697
Good doctor, Europe-returned.
Good family background.

20
00:02:08,873 --> 00:02:10,841
Well, good enough.

21
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:14,167
My daughter is not well.

22
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,575
Do a good job. Make her alright.

23
00:02:16,747 --> 00:02:18,374
l have many friends in this town.

24
00:02:18,482 --> 00:02:20,643
And you have a practice
to build. Right?

25
00:02:20,885 --> 00:02:22,250
Right.
- Right.

26
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:33,857
Where is she, your daughter?

27
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:36,428
She is standing behind the sheet,
like a good girl.

28
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:40,967
But, Ghani Sahib, how will
l examine her without seeing her?

29
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:44,503
Ah, l can see your confusion.

30
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:49,912
You Europe returned chappies
forget certain things.

31
00:02:50,881 --> 00:02:52,644
My daughter is not
going to flaunt her body...

32
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:55,685
...under the nose of any Tom,
Dick or, for that matter, Aziz.

33
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,379
You will...

34
00:02:57,621 --> 00:02:59,851
...specify the portion
that you want to examine.

35
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,182
What does the lady complain of?

36
00:03:03,227 --> 00:03:06,526
My poor child has terrible
- too-dreading - stomach-ache.

37
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:10,560
ln that case, may l examine her?

38
00:03:10,768 --> 00:03:12,497
Yes - Naseem, stomach, pronto.

39
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:32,220
May l?

40
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:33,483
Yeah, yes, you can.

41
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:34,623
Thank you.

42
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:56,445
Doctor Aziz, my poor child
is suffering from constipation.

43
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,448
Yes.
- No, no.

44
00:03:58,782 --> 00:04:00,306
Don't even think about it.

45
00:04:00,351 --> 00:04:02,876
There is no question of being
permitted to administer an enema.

46
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:05,587
No, no. No, no, Ghani Sahib.
- No. l said no.

47
00:04:13,197 --> 00:04:14,391
Doctor Aziz!

48
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,832
Thank you.

49
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:34,679
ls it... permitted that l touch?

50
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:38,249
Touch away, touch away!
Hands of a healer!

51
00:04:38,322 --> 00:04:39,311
Thank you.

52
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:46,325
With your permission, please.

53
00:04:52,736 --> 00:04:54,636
ls it the lady's time of the month?

54
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:55,636
Yes.

55
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:58,298
But then, then... Then
there is nothing to worry about.

56
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,774
lt's, it's, it's alright.

57
00:04:59,843 --> 00:05:01,401
Don't be embarrassed, old chap!

58
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:03,679
You're the family doctor now!

59
00:05:24,535 --> 00:05:27,868
Doctor Aziz... she has a headache.

60
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:49,785
My goodness doctor, what a nose!

61
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:53,553
Yes...

62
00:05:53,597 --> 00:05:54,859
...it's quite a specimen.

63
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,662
l agree.

64
00:06:03,273 --> 00:06:04,740
So, Doctor Aziz.

65
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:08,402
Anything else?

66
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:10,143
Just one more thing...

67
00:06:12,516 --> 00:06:13,813
We will be a modern couple.

68
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,551
Naseem will not wear the veil.

69
00:06:16,654 --> 00:06:17,348
So...

70
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:19,412
...you will allow other
men to look at her face?

71
00:06:20,724 --> 00:06:22,589
Most men,
Ghani Sahib, are not beasts.

72
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,151
Most men are also not blind,
Doctor Sahib.

73
00:06:44,848 --> 00:06:48,807
Listen, would you...
move a little, please.

74
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:53,352
Move where? Move how?.

75
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:58,589
l mean...like, like a woman.

76
00:07:05,836 --> 00:07:07,201
Who have l married?

77
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,703
l know you foreign-educated types.

78
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:14,608
You do God knows what with
those foreign terrible women,

79
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:17,209
...and then you expect
us to be like them.

80
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,508
Listen, Doctor Sahib,

81
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:25,619
husband or no husband,
l am not the moving type.

82
00:07:34,398 --> 00:07:35,387
Goodbye.

83
00:07:59,556 --> 00:08:04,391
ln Agra, my grandfather contracted
a dangerous form of optimism.

84
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:06,788
lt was caused by Mian Abdullah,

85
00:08:07,464 --> 00:08:09,489
...the hope of all lndian Muslims...

86
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:11,761
...who were against the
partition of the country...

87
00:08:11,835 --> 00:08:13,666
...into lndia and Pakistan.

88
00:08:14,438 --> 00:08:17,430
A politician with
a peacock-feather fan.

89
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,801
We can beat them.
- l'm sure.

90
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,175
We are ready for whatever may come.

91
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:23,873
There is talk of dirty deeds.

92
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:25,240
Oh yes?

93
00:08:25,382 --> 00:08:27,782
This is Nadir Khan, my secretary.

94
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:28,714
Nice to meet you, Nadir.

95
00:08:28,786 --> 00:08:31,220
He has a heightened imagination.

96
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:32,784
He's a poet, you see.

97
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:33,845
Oh, a poet...

98
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:37,622
And what poetry! Not a single verse!

99
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:39,285
Not a single verb!

100
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,330
Well, all these ideas seem
out of date to me, excuse me, sir.

101
00:08:43,634 --> 00:08:45,465
All artistic expression is equal,

102
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:49,595
poetry, movies, even the
old men who use their skill to...

103
00:08:49,673 --> 00:08:51,698
...spit out betel-juice
and hit a spittoon.

104
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:53,842
Perhaps l will get you a spittoon,..

105
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:55,503
...so that you can
practice your art.

106
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,410
How about that, Mian Abdullah?

107
00:08:58,649 --> 00:09:00,617
These are new ideas.

108
00:09:04,721 --> 00:09:06,416
We must leave, Your Highness.

109
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,785
Excuse us. Dr. Aziz.

110
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,470
Mian Sahib?

111
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:57,832
Help me, Doctor Aziz.

112
00:10:59,603 --> 00:11:00,695
What?

113
00:11:03,607 --> 00:11:04,699
Please help me.

114
00:11:05,275 --> 00:11:06,401
Who's this?

115
00:11:08,478 --> 00:11:09,638
Sorry for the interruption!

116
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:11,578
Such an intrusion.

117
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:14,247
Nadir?

118
00:11:14,518 --> 00:11:15,610
l had to hide!

119
00:11:15,686 --> 00:11:18,416
ls that you, Nadir? What are you--?

120
00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:21,386
l saw everything, Doctor!

121
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,618
They killed him.

122
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:27,864
l saw them murder him.

123
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:30,832
Assassins shot him like a dog.

124
00:11:30,968 --> 00:11:33,493
And then they saw me!
- Shh. Quiet.

125
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:34,932
You have to hide me, Doctor.

126
00:11:35,505 --> 00:11:36,767
Or l'm a dead man.

127
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:42,439
At home, Doctor Aadam Aziz
found himself surrounded by women.

128
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:45,476
His formidable wife, Naseem,

129
00:11:45,716 --> 00:11:50,210
and their three daughters:
wise Alia, sweet Mumtaz,

130
00:11:50,387 --> 00:11:51,615
and flighty Emerald.

131
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:53,246
He's asked us for our shelter.

132
00:11:53,657 --> 00:11:54,749
We have no choice.

133
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,325
Please.

134
00:12:14,778 --> 00:12:16,939
And spare us your crazy oaths!

135
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,714
Where are you going?

136
00:12:25,288 --> 00:12:26,380
Listen.

137
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:34,319
But, Abba, where will we put him?

138
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:36,495
We'll sweep him under the carpet.

139
00:12:37,534 --> 00:12:39,399
Like all other problems.

140
00:12:50,714 --> 00:12:53,774
Sometimes emotions
are stirred into food...

141
00:12:53,884 --> 00:12:55,579
...and become what you feel.

142
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,314
And sometimes,
people leak into each other;

143
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,221
like flavours when you cook.

144
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:08,229
Mumtaz Aziz,
destined to be my mother,

145
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:13,399
took upon herself the duties of
caring for the needs of Nadir Khan.

146
00:13:37,961 --> 00:13:39,451
You're very good.

147
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:49,335
l'm not a brainbox like Alia,
or a beauty like Emerald.

148
00:13:54,478 --> 00:13:55,968
But you are.

149
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:01,881
Eat, now. Don't let it go cold.

150
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:49,963
Terrible business, sir.
l fully understand your grief.

151
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,735
But you did know this fellow...

152
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:55,896
...Nadir,
secretary to Mian Abdullah?

153
00:14:57,474 --> 00:14:59,601
No, l don't think so, no.

154
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:02,676
Met him at the Rani of cooch
Naheen's on the night of the killing?

155
00:15:03,313 --> 00:15:04,678
Yes, of course...

156
00:15:05,248 --> 00:15:07,478
Yes, l thought you might
be able to shed some light on...

157
00:15:07,551 --> 00:15:09,781
...his disappearance. No?...

158
00:15:13,924 --> 00:15:15,357
No.

159
00:15:15,592 --> 00:15:17,719
And of course these
charming young ladies...

160
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:19,386
...of yours have also seen nothing.

161
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:21,589
And if we should see something,
Major Zulfikar,

162
00:15:21,665 --> 00:15:22,495
what should we do?

163
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:23,758
Ah. Miss Emerald.

164
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,494
Naturally you should
inform your father...

165
00:15:25,569 --> 00:15:28,697
...who will then alert me in my
office at the military cantonment.

166
00:15:28,838 --> 00:15:31,864
Yes, of course. - Of course.
Thank you so much, Major.

167
00:15:32,475 --> 00:15:33,772
Yes.

168
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:35,377
Thank you, Major.

169
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:40,479
Sir, ladies.

170
00:15:42,252 --> 00:15:43,685
Madam.

171
00:15:49,593 --> 00:15:50,787
Did you see that girl, captain?

172
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,849
Yes, sir.

173
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:54,226
That, captain,
is the girl l intend to marry.

174
00:15:54,297 --> 00:15:55,389
Yes, sir.

175
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:13,442
Feeling left out by her
self-imposed vow of silence,

176
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,219
my grandmother eavesdropped
on her daughters' dreams.

177
00:16:26,429 --> 00:16:28,522
She visited Emerald's dreams...

178
00:16:29,466 --> 00:16:32,594
...and found Zulfikar
lurking in them.

179
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:51,648
ln Alia's, she saw the successful
and handsome businessman...

180
00:16:51,921 --> 00:16:53,513
... Ahmed Sinai.

181
00:17:02,766 --> 00:17:06,429
And in Mumtaz's, she saw a son.

182
00:17:07,671 --> 00:17:11,539
A boy with a cucumber nose,
unfortunately.

183
00:17:21,351 --> 00:17:26,288
No, tell me a poem -- one of yours.

184
00:17:26,356 --> 00:17:29,257
No, no, you wouldn't like it, ok?

185
00:17:29,326 --> 00:17:32,625
You must!
The best one you ever wrote.

186
00:17:33,196 --> 00:17:35,664
lt's got no rhymes. lt's free verse.

187
00:17:35,765 --> 00:17:37,323
Does it at least have a name?

188
00:17:41,805 --> 00:17:42,703
Yes.

189
00:17:42,872 --> 00:17:44,237
So? What is it?

190
00:17:46,343 --> 00:17:47,401
''Mumtaz.''

191
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,224
Spittoon.

192
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:14,366
So that you can practise your art.

193
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:15,797
See, l remembered.

194
00:18:16,506 --> 00:18:19,168
Okay, l'm sorry, everyone,
but is this really happening?

195
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:21,276
They're going to get married
and live in the cellar...

196
00:18:21,344 --> 00:18:22,868
...and we have to keep the secret?

197
00:18:23,213 --> 00:18:24,305
For how long?

198
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:26,142
Ten years? This is ridiculous.

199
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:29,185
Please, Emerald. There
might still be killers out there.

200
00:18:29,252 --> 00:18:30,276
l need some time.

201
00:18:30,387 --> 00:18:32,412
What would Major Zulfikar say?

202
00:18:32,689 --> 00:18:35,590
Already he wonders,
how Nadir survived the shooting.

203
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:38,354
lf Nadir is innocent he should
go to the Major and come clean.

204
00:18:38,428 --> 00:18:41,522
lf Nadir is innocent? lf, you say?

205
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:43,623
Please, Emerald.
Some time, na?

206
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,728
Okay, okay.

207
00:18:48,338 --> 00:18:49,168
Hide on...

208
00:18:49,239 --> 00:18:50,866
...like a fat worm under the ground.

209
00:18:51,207 --> 00:18:52,265
Emerald.

210
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:53,433
Enough.

211
00:18:57,347 --> 00:18:58,507
Begin the ceremony, please.

212
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:25,501
l'm sorry.

213
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:28,502
No. No, it's okay.

214
00:19:29,345 --> 00:19:31,540
lt's okay. lt'll come, alright.

215
00:20:05,415 --> 00:20:08,543
Family history,
too, has dietary laws.

216
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:12,183
One is supposed only
to swallow the halal parts,

217
00:20:12,355 --> 00:20:13,754
drained of blood.

218
00:20:15,225 --> 00:20:17,750
But that makes the
stories less juicy,

219
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:20,462
and this was ajuicy part.

220
00:20:20,897 --> 00:20:22,364
So it must be told.

221
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:24,925
Try again.

222
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,207
What's going on?

223
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:34,468
- Abba,
- Move!

224
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:37,577
Abba, abba,
please don't tell them anything...

225
00:20:37,647 --> 00:20:39,342
this house for far too long.

226
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:40,746
Abbajan... please, what's wrong?

227
00:20:40,817 --> 00:20:43,285
What's wrong? What's wrong you
say - l'll tell you what's wrong!

228
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:45,478
My daughter tells
me she is still a virgin!

229
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:47,280
That's what is wrong.

230
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:50,521
l love my husband.

231
00:20:50,593 --> 00:20:52,527
What?
- l love him, abba.

232
00:20:52,662 --> 00:20:54,892
The other thing will come, right?
lt will.

233
00:20:55,565 --> 00:20:57,692
A marriage should
not depend on this thing,

234
00:20:58,768 --> 00:20:59,894
but on love.

235
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:03,772
This should not have been mentioned.

236
00:21:32,335 --> 00:21:33,495
Down there!

237
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:35,929
Weapons out!
- No!

238
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:37,672
You'll thank me later,
just wait and see.

239
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,764
Stay tight!

240
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:45,872
Follow me, boys!

241
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:58,853
Women must marry men, not mice.

242
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:00,627
So you found your voice.

243
00:22:00,897 --> 00:22:02,922
Whose crazy fool's
scheme was this...

244
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:04,926
...to allow this coward
who hides underground...

245
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:06,600
...like a worm, into our home?

246
00:22:06,703 --> 00:22:07,863
The bird has turned!

247
00:22:08,838 --> 00:22:09,827
The worm has flown!

248
00:22:09,906 --> 00:22:12,670
After all that,
he actually got away?

249
00:22:40,703 --> 00:22:41,829
l divorce thee,

250
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:43,628
l divorce thee,

251
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,340
l divorce thee.

252
00:22:52,682 --> 00:22:54,240
That sweet man...

253
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:57,379
...he set me free.

254
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:09,328
Please look over here, sir.

255
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:12,629
Big smile!

256
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,559
Thank you.

257
00:23:15,638 --> 00:23:17,367
Thank you. Thank you.

258
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:20,208
lt's a... lt's a beautiful wedding,
sir, really.

259
00:23:20,276 --> 00:23:21,368
Most grateful.

260
00:23:21,611 --> 00:23:23,340
Damn glad l chose
not to charge you...

261
00:23:23,413 --> 00:23:24,812
...with harbouring
a wanted criminal.

262
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:26,609
Married your daughter instead.

263
00:23:26,783 --> 00:23:29,479
Thank you, sir. Thanks very much.

264
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:37,486
Go away!

265
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:48,928
You know,
l've always loved children.

266
00:23:49,439 --> 00:23:50,565
Me too.

267
00:23:51,507 --> 00:23:55,341
But never had any.
My former wife couldn't.

268
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:58,710
Oh, l'm sorry.
But, you could always still...

269
00:23:58,781 --> 00:23:59,679
Marry again.

270
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:01,548
Yes.

271
00:24:02,518 --> 00:24:04,679
Well, if l found the right girl.

272
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:10,859
And, if she would have me,
if l asked.

273
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:14,894
Yes?

274
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,560
Yes.

275
00:24:20,403 --> 00:24:22,837
And move to Bombay with me.

276
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:24,670
We're moving to...?

277
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:29,576
l mean, you're moving?

278
00:24:30,346 --> 00:24:31,904
Safer for a family, no?

279
00:24:56,839 --> 00:24:58,329
Big smile!

280
00:25:11,721 --> 00:25:12,517
Mumtaz..

281
00:25:44,187 --> 00:25:45,484
l've got something for you.

282
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:49,517
What? A present?

283
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:53,558
Better than that. A new name.

284
00:25:54,363 --> 00:25:55,421
Amina.

285
00:25:57,834 --> 00:25:58,823
Do you like it?

286
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,628
Amina...

287
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:02,762
Yes.

288
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,299
Nadir and Mumtaz
are in the past now.

289
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,613
Better to leave them behind, no?

290
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:17,475
A new name for a new beginning...

291
00:26:18,287 --> 00:26:20,687
Mrs Amina Sinai.

292
00:26:23,693 --> 00:26:25,183
Whatever you say.

293
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:33,333
Why did she marry him so quickly?
For solace?

294
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:36,328
For the children they
both wanted so much?

295
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:40,469
My mother Amina Sinai,
in her new incarnation,

296
00:26:41,177 --> 00:26:43,270
resolved to forget the poet Nadir...

297
00:26:43,646 --> 00:26:46,877
...and fall in love with my father,
Ahmed Sinai.

298
00:26:48,217 --> 00:26:49,912
But love is a rare thing...

299
00:27:05,568 --> 00:27:06,728
Ah Bombay!

300
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,639
Bombay, of which the old tunes sang,

301
00:27:10,907 --> 00:27:13,899
''Prima in lndis!
Gateway to lndia!

302
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:17,304
Star of the East with
her face to the West!''

303
00:27:17,847 --> 00:27:19,405
Ah Bombay!

304
00:27:26,622 --> 00:27:28,647
Ah, Mr Methwold.

305
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:30,883
Mr Sinai. How do you do?

306
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,889
Very well, and you? My wife.

307
00:27:35,197 --> 00:27:37,392
Well, Mr Methwold, l must say...

308
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:40,333
...the price you're asking
for Buckingham Villa, it's...

309
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:41,828
lt's rather...

310
00:27:41,938 --> 00:27:43,462
well, it's absolutely...

311
00:27:43,673 --> 00:27:47,200
Ridiculous.
Yes, a ridiculously low price.

312
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:50,409
We're giving the whole blasted
country away, in point of fact.

313
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:53,443
Hundreds of years of decent,
honourable...

314
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:55,450
...government and then
all of a sudden it's up and off.

315
00:27:58,187 --> 00:28:00,246
You must admit,
though, we weren't all bad.

316
00:28:00,356 --> 00:28:01,186
Not at all.

317
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:02,747
We built your schools...

318
00:28:02,858 --> 00:28:04,416
...railway stations...

319
00:28:05,294 --> 00:28:07,319
...trains, so forth...

320
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:18,665
l was just telling my
wife what a fine man you are!

321
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:41,886
Look here, Willie,
do me a favour, man, will you.

322
00:28:42,164 --> 00:28:43,529
l've got this terrible headache.

323
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,897
And if you could nip
down to Kemp's corner

324
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:48,632
...and ask the chemist
to give you some pills.

325
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:52,739
Servants are all down with a cold.
Otherwise l wouldn't have asked.

326
00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:55,468
Yes, sir. Of course, sir.

327
00:28:55,544 --> 00:28:56,511
Good man.

328
00:29:27,209 --> 00:29:30,736
My own little transfer
of power will also take place...

329
00:29:30,813 --> 00:29:34,943
at midnight on August
the 14th, 1947.

330
00:29:36,786 --> 00:29:38,686
When lndia rids itself of us...

331
00:29:39,722 --> 00:29:40,780
Buckingham Villa...

332
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:45,617
...will be free of
William Methwold. Me.

333
00:29:46,829 --> 00:29:49,821
...And the grass must be
sprayed every single night.

334
00:29:50,766 --> 00:29:52,358
Well, absolutely, Mr Methwold.

335
00:29:52,435 --> 00:29:54,232
Well, as you say in Hindustani,

336
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:57,271
Sab kuch ticktock hai.
Everything is tickety-boo.

337
00:29:57,339 --> 00:29:58,431
Absolutely.

338
00:29:59,642 --> 00:30:02,736
And another small detail, Mr Sinai.

339
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:06,781
Nothing in the house must
change until lndependence.

340
00:30:07,383 --> 00:30:10,511
lt must be bought complete
with its entire contents.

341
00:30:10,619 --> 00:30:12,746
Janum, everything?

342
00:30:13,222 --> 00:30:16,385
Not even a spoon can be thrown?
And this lamp... for two months?

343
00:30:20,596 --> 00:30:21,654
Well, Mr Sinai?

344
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,493
Yes sir, Mr Methwold?

345
00:30:25,835 --> 00:30:27,769
One other little condition.

346
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:31,531
We will take a cocktail here,
in the grounds of Buckingham Villa,

347
00:30:31,674 --> 00:30:33,904
every evening until
my departure from lndia.

348
00:30:34,376 --> 00:30:35,343
Very well.

349
00:30:47,823 --> 00:30:52,658
Good night ladies,
good night, ladies...

350
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:55,697
This is Wee Willie.
Local tramp and his wife, Vanita.

351
00:30:55,931 --> 00:30:57,398
You'll be seeing a lot of them.

352
00:31:07,676 --> 00:31:12,204
farewell ladies, farewell ladies...

353
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:14,546
farewell ladies...

354
00:31:14,617 --> 00:31:16,949
...we're going to say goodnight.

355
00:31:21,824 --> 00:31:24,384
Good night ladies...

356
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,552
Good night ladies...

357
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:29,257
Sings well, your Wee Willie.
Damn silly name, though.

358
00:31:30,833 --> 00:31:32,528
But you gave it to him.

359
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:35,431
So l did. Amongst other things.

360
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,710
Good night ladies...

361
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:46,312
...good night ladies...

362
00:31:46,382 --> 00:31:48,942
we're going to leave you now.

363
00:31:49,218 --> 00:31:50,515
We're going...

364
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:54,784
...to say good night!

365
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:57,247
Very good, Willie.

366
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:01,460
Wee Willie Winkie is my name;
to sing for my supper is my fame.

367
00:32:01,597 --> 00:32:03,462
l hope you are com-for-table

368
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:05,198
...or are you come-for-tea?

369
00:32:05,834 --> 00:32:08,325
Oh, joke-joke ladies and ladahs!

370
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:10,633
Bottoms up.

371
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:13,800
Fix you another one?

372
00:32:13,943 --> 00:32:15,808
How kind. Thank you, Mr Sinai.

373
00:32:19,315 --> 00:32:20,509
Pretty girl, that.

374
00:32:21,917 --> 00:32:24,283
Must be due around
about the same time as you.

375
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:28,185
Sab kuch ticktock hai.

376
00:32:29,225 --> 00:32:31,216
Everything is indeed, tickety-boo.

377
00:32:31,293 --> 00:32:32,624
Tickety-boo...

378
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:03,653
l think, Madame,
you're going to have a baby boy.

379
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:43,197
Joe! My God!

380
00:33:46,535 --> 00:33:47,524
What are you doing here?

381
00:33:49,505 --> 00:33:50,597
You and your politics!

382
00:34:09,525 --> 00:34:10,549
Against the rich.

383
00:34:15,264 --> 00:34:17,459
The rich need to become poor,
and the poor rich.

384
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:20,294
Understand, Mary?

385
00:34:20,703 --> 00:34:22,762
You need money?
- No.

386
00:34:27,676 --> 00:34:32,477
Pakistan and lndia were born washing
themselves in one another's blood.

387
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:36,749
The empire on which
the sun never sets.

388
00:34:36,885 --> 00:34:38,750
But l will not describe it.

389
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,518
l will avert my eyes
from the violence.

390
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:46,226
Selfish perhaps,
but excusably so in my opinion.

391
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:49,563
After all,
one is not born every day.

392
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:56,261
Long years ago we made
a tryst with destiny.

393
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:02,233
And now the time comes when
we shall redeem our pledge...

394
00:35:02,811 --> 00:35:04,301
...not wholly...

395
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,248
...or in full measure,
but very substantially.

396
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,838
Busy night!

397
00:35:37,913 --> 00:35:38,709
Joe!

398
00:35:38,881 --> 00:35:41,281
l need to get out of Bombay.
They're after me.

399
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:53,217
We need to do it now, Mary.

400
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:54,823
The real revolution.

401
00:36:09,778 --> 00:36:11,177
Say you love me.

402
00:36:13,215 --> 00:36:14,443
Say it once.

403
00:36:17,319 --> 00:36:21,881
At the stroke of the midnight hour,
when the world sleeps...

404
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:25,552
lndia will awake
to life and freedom.

405
00:36:26,762 --> 00:36:31,495
A moment comes,
which comes but rarely in history...

406
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:33,234
...when we step out...

407
00:36:33,302 --> 00:36:34,860
...from the old to the new.

408
00:36:35,504 --> 00:36:39,907
When an age ends,
and when the soul of a nation,

409
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:43,643
long suppressed, finds utterance.

410
00:36:45,447 --> 00:36:49,383
At the precise instant of
lndia's arrival at independence.

411
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:52,779
On the stroke of midnight,
as a matter of fact,

412
00:36:53,922 --> 00:36:56,550
l tumbled forth into the world.

413
00:37:01,897 --> 00:37:03,330
Vanita?

414
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:06,495
Oh, Jesus.

415
00:37:19,648 --> 00:37:21,878
Poor baby...

416
00:37:23,652 --> 00:37:24,778
...poor thing.

417
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,319
Mommy no more.

418
00:37:30,526 --> 00:37:32,858
Oh Mary, so many babies...

419
00:37:32,928 --> 00:37:33,792
Give it to me.

420
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,498
Private room number four. Sinai.

421
00:37:39,501 --> 00:37:41,765
Sinai.

422
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,723
Two babies in her hands.

423
00:38:12,367 --> 00:38:13,834
Two lives in her power.

424
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,739
She did it for Joe;
her own private, revolutionary act.

425
00:38:21,176 --> 00:38:23,736
''Love me, Joe,'' was in Mary's mind.

426
00:38:27,249 --> 00:38:28,477
And then it was done.

427
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:31,311
Okay, Joe?

428
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,663
When she gave the
child of my mother's womb

429
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,324
to Wee Willie Winkie,

430
00:38:46,602 --> 00:38:49,833
Mary knew she was condemning
the rich born boy...

431
00:38:49,905 --> 00:38:53,204
...to a life of
accordions and poverty.

432
00:38:56,578 --> 00:38:57,840
Shiva...

433
00:38:59,247 --> 00:39:02,876
As Joe had said,
let the rich be poor...

434
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:05,713
...and the poor, rich.

435
00:39:13,962 --> 00:39:15,429
Thank you.

436
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:21,196
Saleem. Saleem Sinai.

437
00:39:23,805 --> 00:39:27,935
Look, janum. Poor fellow,
he's got his grandfather's nose!

438
00:39:28,744 --> 00:39:30,268
Go call the newspapers.

439
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:32,440
Tell the photographers to come!

440
00:39:34,916 --> 00:39:37,407
''A charming pose
of Baby Saleem Sinai,''

441
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:40,952
''born on the exact moment
of our nation's independence.''

442
00:39:41,623 --> 00:39:44,683
''We shall be watching over your
life with the closest attention.''

443
00:39:44,993 --> 00:39:48,485
''lt will be in a sense,
a mirror of our own.''

444
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:52,231
''The happy child
of the glorious hour!''

445
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:54,400
Hold it up.

446
00:39:57,773 --> 00:39:58,705
Look at me.

447
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:04,936
come, let's go home.

448
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:05,203
Mary, unable in her
fright to confess her crime,

449
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:07,667
realized she had been a fool.

450
00:41:08,777 --> 00:41:10,404
She cursed herself...

451
00:41:11,446 --> 00:41:12,913
...but kept her secret.

452
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:17,245
And decided to make
amends of a kind...

453
00:41:18,386 --> 00:41:19,876
...to a motherless boy.

454
00:41:27,562 --> 00:41:29,530
Mary, isn't it?
- Yes.

455
00:41:29,598 --> 00:41:31,498
From Dr Narlikar's clinic?
- Yes.

456
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,897
ls something the matter?

457
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:38,768
No. l just wanted to
know if you need any Nanny.

458
00:41:42,844 --> 00:41:44,311
Well, yes, actually l do.

459
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:47,378
come.

460
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:48,447
Thank you.

461
00:41:53,655 --> 00:41:54,781
Hi...

462
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:59,456
First time l saw him
l was just done for him.

463
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,854
Who has come?

464
00:42:03,932 --> 00:42:04,830
Winkie...

465
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,333
...Winkie!

466
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:09,199
can l come?
- come.

467
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,580
Mary...

468
00:42:26,922 --> 00:42:28,583
Please go give him some money.

469
00:42:28,957 --> 00:42:29,946
Here.

470
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:01,680
Hold this.

471
00:43:16,771 --> 00:43:18,238
Bless you, baby.

472
00:43:26,915 --> 00:43:33,445
come, come. There there.

473
00:43:33,788 --> 00:43:36,188
Saleem. Baba.

474
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:39,822
Anything you want to be...

475
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:43,456
you can be...

476
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:46,665
you can be...

477
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:49,462
you want.

478
00:43:52,507 --> 00:43:55,670
...Anything you want to be...

479
00:43:55,944 --> 00:43:59,573
By our tenth birthday,
lndia and myself...

480
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:02,544
...were both under
a lot of pressure.

481
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:05,650
There was growth, there were gains,

482
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:09,487
there were five-year
plans and good exam results.

483
00:44:09,557 --> 00:44:10,387
Anything you want to--

484
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,652
Mary, please can
you stop singing that.

485
00:44:13,261 --> 00:44:14,353
You can be...

486
00:44:14,429 --> 00:44:15,361
Please, Mary.

487
00:44:15,497 --> 00:44:16,930
But there was also...

488
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:19,764
...the weight of expectation...

489
00:44:19,834 --> 00:44:20,892
Please, Mary.

490
00:44:24,606 --> 00:44:26,506
...lt was a lot to live up to.

491
00:44:31,479 --> 00:44:32,810
Aren't you forgetting
something, Saleem?

492
00:44:34,215 --> 00:44:35,341
Where's my morning hug?

493
00:44:36,685 --> 00:44:37,583
come on!

494
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:44,217
come on. come on. come on! Yes!

495
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:48,461
Stop it, Abba, it's embarrassing!

496
00:44:48,897 --> 00:44:49,795
Embarrassing?

497
00:44:49,965 --> 00:44:50,795
What nonsense.

498
00:44:50,865 --> 00:44:51,923
Ammi!

499
00:44:55,904 --> 00:44:59,704
Great things in store for you,
my son! l love you.

500
00:44:59,908 --> 00:45:00,772
come.

501
00:45:01,876 --> 00:45:02,900
And me Abba?

502
00:45:03,411 --> 00:45:05,140
Yes you, too, Jamila.

503
00:45:05,246 --> 00:45:07,373
Jamila, Abba's just joking.

504
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,442
You want green chutney, baba?

505
00:45:10,518 --> 00:45:11,746
Yes, sure. Of course.

506
00:45:12,287 --> 00:45:13,914
What a fine boy!

507
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:16,247
See if l care.

508
00:45:22,364 --> 00:45:23,456
Jamila!

509
00:45:23,865 --> 00:45:25,332
Yes, Ammi?

510
00:45:26,601 --> 00:45:27,932
coming!

511
00:45:34,743 --> 00:45:35,710
Hey, Saleem.

512
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:39,338
Suppose it turns out
that you're not that special.

513
00:45:39,481 --> 00:45:42,575
Suppose in the end
you're just normal.

514
00:45:43,885 --> 00:45:44,943
l know.

515
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:48,845
Anything you want to be...
- Shut up! Stupid.

516
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:51,723
Anything...

517
00:46:03,538 --> 00:46:04,630
Wife!

518
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:21,552
Frozen.

519
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,487
Freeze a Muslim's assets they say,
and he'll run back to Pakistan.

520
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,323
Leaving all his wealth behind.

521
00:46:33,935 --> 00:46:35,800
But we must do something!
- What?

522
00:46:35,904 --> 00:46:38,168
Something. We have law courts.
We have to fight!

523
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,799
Fight? How?. With what?

524
00:46:41,543 --> 00:46:43,670
They have shoved my
balls into an ice bucket.

525
00:46:52,353 --> 00:46:53,513
Janum, please.

526
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,826
Though some of his
assets eventually unfroze,

527
00:47:09,804 --> 00:47:13,399
from that moment,
my father entered a deep solitude.

528
00:47:14,476 --> 00:47:19,243
And a strange perfume started wafting
out from under his study door.

529
00:47:23,184 --> 00:47:25,618
Jamila said it was
the smell of stale food,

530
00:47:26,387 --> 00:47:30,289
but it's my belief that
it was the aroma of failure.

531
00:47:39,901 --> 00:47:42,836
When l say 'doggie',
you'll say 'woof, woof'.

532
00:47:43,671 --> 00:47:44,660
What will you say?

533
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:45,797
Woof, woof!

534
00:47:45,874 --> 00:47:48,399
Woof, woof. Let's go. Woof, woof.

535
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:55,405
How much is that
doggie in the window?.

536
00:47:55,483 --> 00:47:56,381
Woof! Woof!

537
00:47:56,451 --> 00:47:59,420
The one with the waggily tail...

538
00:47:59,587 --> 00:48:02,681
How much is that
doggie in the window?.

539
00:48:02,757 --> 00:48:03,781
Woof! Woof!

540
00:48:03,858 --> 00:48:07,658
l do hope that dog is for sale...

541
00:48:08,596 --> 00:48:10,791
Shiva, get the money.

542
00:48:19,807 --> 00:48:21,832
Give Shiva some money.

543
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:32,677
What happened?

544
00:48:32,754 --> 00:48:33,721
Let's go.

545
00:48:34,389 --> 00:48:35,515
l said, let's go.

546
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:52,837
Bloody rich boy.

547
00:49:00,215 --> 00:49:02,740
Saleem, quickly. come.

548
00:49:07,355 --> 00:49:08,481
Look there.

549
00:49:09,691 --> 00:49:12,626
You see it? lt's Sputnik.

550
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:14,818
Great achievement for Man.

551
00:49:16,965 --> 00:49:21,698
Listen, Saleem,
my achievements have been small,

552
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:23,870
my ambitions thwarted.

553
00:49:24,872 --> 00:49:28,239
But you, my son,
yours must be big.

554
00:49:28,576 --> 00:49:30,203
Do you understand?
- Yes, Abba.

555
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,888
Hello. No. lt's the wrong

556
00:49:50,398 --> 00:49:51,831
l told you this is the wrong number!

557
00:50:34,976 --> 00:50:36,500
Nadir.

558
00:50:57,498 --> 00:50:59,363
Who's..? Who's in there?

559
00:50:59,767 --> 00:51:03,225
Ammi, l swear, l didn't
see anything! Wait a minute, Ammi!

560
00:51:03,404 --> 00:51:04,598
There are voices in my head!

561
00:51:04,672 --> 00:51:05,934
come!

562
00:51:06,207 --> 00:51:06,901
Ammi, l...

563
00:51:09,644 --> 00:51:12,374
Not one word for one whole day!
- Ammi, l...

564
00:51:12,914 --> 00:51:14,905
Not one word.

565
00:51:17,218 --> 00:51:20,210
Shhh.. Not one word.
- Mary, listen...

566
00:51:20,254 --> 00:51:21,516
Shhh...shhh...SHHH!

567
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:45,240
Saleem! Saleem, listen to me.

568
00:51:45,313 --> 00:51:47,873
We are your friends. We're just
like you! Listen to me, Saleem.

569
00:51:47,949 --> 00:51:52,545
We are your friends.
We're just like you!

570
00:51:53,721 --> 00:51:56,554
We are your friends.
We're just like you!

571
00:51:58,793 --> 00:52:00,818
By the morning,
l had discovered that...

572
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:03,830
...l could somehow control
the volume of the voices

573
00:52:03,898 --> 00:52:05,490
...through my nose!

574
00:52:05,933 --> 00:52:09,926
Fear left me,
and l was thinking, ''Man!

575
00:52:10,471 --> 00:52:12,803
This is better than
All-lndia-Radio!''

576
00:52:13,741 --> 00:52:15,572
Abbu, Ammi:

577
00:52:15,643 --> 00:52:17,804
Mary, please can
l have your attention?

578
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,938
You have something to tell us?

579
00:52:21,282 --> 00:52:22,476
An apology, l hope.

580
00:52:22,683 --> 00:52:25,481
Ammi, something really
big has happened finally!

581
00:52:25,553 --> 00:52:26,645
But first, please call Abba.

582
00:52:26,721 --> 00:52:27,915
Most certainly not.

583
00:52:28,356 --> 00:52:29,288
What's going on?

584
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:31,552
Abbu, Ammi: l'm hearing voices.

585
00:52:31,726 --> 00:52:33,591
Voices are speaking
to me inside my head.

586
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:36,523
l really think that Archangels
have started to talk to me.

587
00:52:36,597 --> 00:52:38,326
What's wrong?
Has your brain gone raw?.

588
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,527
Are you growing into a madman?

589
00:52:40,668 --> 00:52:41,635
Oh, Jesus.

590
00:52:41,803 --> 00:52:43,498
What is it?
- Please, move aside.

591
00:52:44,372 --> 00:52:45,270
Abba?

592
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,368
What happened son?

593
00:52:48,976 --> 00:52:50,876
You're hearing voices
inside your head?

594
00:52:50,945 --> 00:52:51,877
Yes.

595
00:52:54,882 --> 00:52:56,747
Still hearing those voices, ha?

596
00:52:57,485 --> 00:52:58,747
Still hearing the voices?

597
00:53:07,528 --> 00:53:08,688
That was necessary...

598
00:53:09,497 --> 00:53:11,192
...to avoid repetition.

599
00:53:16,938 --> 00:53:18,769
Saleem, listen to me!

600
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,332
Saleem listen to me!

601
00:53:21,509 --> 00:53:23,500
Saleem listen to me!

602
00:53:24,479 --> 00:53:26,344
Saleem listen to me!

603
00:53:26,414 --> 00:53:27,403
We are your friends![sic]

604
00:53:27,648 --> 00:53:30,549
Saleem listen to me! Saleem.

605
00:53:30,618 --> 00:53:33,883
Saleem, Saleem listen to me!
Saleem...

606
00:53:34,655 --> 00:53:36,816
Saleem, Saleem listen to me!
Saleem...

607
00:53:36,958 --> 00:53:40,894
Saleem, Saleem listen to me!
Saleem...

608
00:53:42,597 --> 00:53:44,861
Saleem listen to me! Saleem.

609
00:53:47,735 --> 00:53:48,929
Go away!

610
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:51,196
l don't want you!

611
00:53:52,373 --> 00:53:53,897
Did you see what Abbu did?

612
00:53:59,547 --> 00:54:02,607
Hello? No, it's the wrong number.

613
00:54:06,821 --> 00:54:07,788
When?

614
00:54:09,423 --> 00:54:10,617
Where?

615
00:54:13,294 --> 00:54:14,921
l told you: lt's the wrong number!

616
00:54:29,911 --> 00:54:32,607
And now she'll go out by herself.

617
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:43,181
Once upon a time,
there was an underground husband...

618
00:54:43,391 --> 00:54:46,883
...who fled,
leaving loving messages of divorce.

619
00:54:49,263 --> 00:54:50,662
After a lost decade...

620
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:53,960
...he emerged from
goodness-knows-where.

621
00:54:58,573 --> 00:55:01,667
l watched my mother
and Nadir Khan...

622
00:55:03,578 --> 00:55:04,875
...and l saw the kiss.

623
00:55:06,514 --> 00:55:08,277
The indirect kiss.

624
00:55:56,797 --> 00:55:58,628
l'll be gob-smacked.

625
00:56:08,309 --> 00:56:10,243
Saleem? What on earth
are you doing here?

626
00:56:10,311 --> 00:56:11,903
Don't talk to me! l hate you!

627
00:56:12,246 --> 00:56:13,508
What's happening, darling?

628
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:16,607
You know what's happening!
l saw everything. l saw it all.

629
00:56:16,684 --> 00:56:17,912
l saw what you did!

630
00:56:18,185 --> 00:56:19,209
What did l do?

631
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,713
No more of these wrong-number calls,
okay, Amma?

632
00:56:21,889 --> 00:56:23,379
Don't go out to see other men!

633
00:56:23,791 --> 00:56:25,850
No more of this glass-kissery!

634
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:27,757
l hate you!

635
00:56:40,908 --> 00:56:44,537
Saleem!
Saleem, listen to me! Saleem!

636
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:48,712
Go away!
l told you! Get out of my head!

637
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:52,813
Saleem! We're your friends!
We're like you!

638
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:56,951
We're not friends.
l don't even know you.

639
00:57:00,394 --> 00:57:02,191
Never call on this number again.

640
00:57:14,308 --> 00:57:15,400
Saleem!

641
00:57:16,577 --> 00:57:18,169
Saleem?

642
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:21,312
Saleem, we are your friends.

643
00:57:21,716 --> 00:57:22,774
We're like you.

644
00:57:22,917 --> 00:57:25,351
We were born then, on that night.

645
00:57:26,487 --> 00:57:29,285
You mean my midnight?

646
00:57:29,557 --> 00:57:30,524
That midnight?

647
00:57:31,192 --> 00:57:32,921
Yes, in that first hour.

648
00:57:35,162 --> 00:57:36,151
All of you?

649
00:57:36,464 --> 00:57:39,399
Yes, all of us!

650
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,295
But how can l hear you all?

651
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:44,233
How can l see you?

652
00:57:45,172 --> 00:57:46,400
We all have gifts.

653
00:57:46,474 --> 00:57:48,339
The closer to midnight
our birth-times,

654
00:57:48,442 --> 00:57:49,670
the greater our gifts.

655
00:57:49,844 --> 00:57:51,368
Who's there?

656
00:57:53,781 --> 00:57:57,376
Saleem and Shiva. Shiva and Saleem.

657
00:57:58,586 --> 00:58:02,181
Both born on the stroke
of midnight both alike.

658
00:58:02,389 --> 00:58:03,481
Same to same.

659
00:58:03,824 --> 00:58:04,756
My gift...

660
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:05,723
...is to fight.

661
00:58:06,127 --> 00:58:08,220
He's the only one who
can bring us all together.

662
00:58:08,329 --> 00:58:10,695
He's overthrow a government.

663
00:58:16,470 --> 00:58:17,232
Aren't you...

664
00:58:17,304 --> 00:58:19,829
Wee Willie's son?
How's your father anyway?

665
00:58:19,907 --> 00:58:21,135
Talking to yourself?

666
00:58:21,242 --> 00:58:23,403
Ammi is right,
your brain has really gone raw.

667
00:58:23,477 --> 00:58:24,501
Get lost!

668
00:58:24,678 --> 00:58:26,270
See if l care!

669
00:58:33,287 --> 00:58:35,915
Where are you all going?
Why you are leaving?

670
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:40,554
You'll get better at this.

671
00:58:40,828 --> 00:58:41,760
At what?

672
00:58:41,829 --> 00:58:42,761
This.

673
00:58:51,806 --> 00:58:55,742
children of midnight? No.

674
00:58:57,278 --> 00:58:58,939
Midnight's children.

675
01:00:06,881 --> 01:00:08,246
You see this man?

676
01:00:09,817 --> 01:00:14,220
This man brought
civilization to savages.

677
01:00:14,521 --> 01:00:16,716
And he commanded respect.

678
01:00:17,658 --> 01:00:18,784
How?.

679
01:00:21,295 --> 01:00:22,489
With his...?

680
01:00:23,497 --> 01:00:24,964
Sword, sir?
- correct!

681
01:00:25,566 --> 01:00:28,933
So, today's subject
-- Human Geography.

682
01:00:30,204 --> 01:00:31,296
Sinai?

683
01:00:33,774 --> 01:00:35,264
Sir?

684
01:00:37,211 --> 01:00:38,838
This is what, Sinai?

685
01:00:38,913 --> 01:00:39,880
Sir, l don't know, sir.

686
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:42,710
Ah, you don't know, my friend!
come with me.

687
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:44,581
So, l ask again...

688
01:00:44,652 --> 01:00:45,619
Ah!

689
01:00:45,786 --> 01:00:48,346
Do you know what is Human Geography?

690
01:00:48,389 --> 01:00:49,947
Oh! Sir, please! Sir, please, sir!

691
01:00:57,431 --> 01:01:01,197
Regard, please, the hideous
face of this primitive creature.

692
01:01:01,268 --> 01:01:03,236
lt reminds you of...?
- Sir, the devil, sir!

693
01:01:03,304 --> 01:01:04,703
Sir, a vegetable, sir!

694
01:01:04,772 --> 01:01:06,239
A cousin of mine, sir!

695
01:01:06,307 --> 01:01:07,535
l don't know which one--

696
01:01:07,574 --> 01:01:10,543
Silence, sons of baboons!
This object here is human geography.

697
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:12,269
How, sir? Where, sir?

698
01:01:12,346 --> 01:01:15,440
ln the face of this ugly ape, you
don't see the whole map of lndia?

699
01:01:15,516 --> 01:01:17,211
No, sir!

700
01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:20,817
See, the Deccan
peninsula hanging down?

701
01:01:23,223 --> 01:01:26,750
And the stains!
These stains are Pakistan.

702
01:01:27,194 --> 01:01:29,719
The birthmark on the
right is East Pakistan,

703
01:01:29,797 --> 01:01:32,766
and this horrible stain is where...?

704
01:01:40,474 --> 01:01:43,466
Tell me what you are!

705
01:01:43,544 --> 01:01:44,738
An animal, sir?

706
01:01:44,812 --> 01:01:46,404
Tell me what you are!

707
01:01:47,681 --> 01:01:49,876
Er, accidents will happen,
Mrs Sinai.

708
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,774
What's wrong with you, Mr crusoe?

709
01:01:51,852 --> 01:01:53,342
l'm here because
one of your teachers...

710
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:54,978
...pulled out a clump
of hair from my son's scalp...

711
01:01:55,255 --> 01:01:56,244
and this is what
you have to say to me?

712
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:57,655
Just shoo!

713
01:01:57,725 --> 01:01:58,521
Go!

714
01:02:05,165 --> 01:02:06,462
Let's have a look, shall we?

715
01:02:07,401 --> 01:02:08,663
This won't hurt a bit.

716
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,731
We've a given him a mild sedative.

717
01:02:14,842 --> 01:02:17,504
lt'll make him a little groggy,
but it'll help him get better.

718
01:02:17,945 --> 01:02:19,310
You'll be fine soon, okay?

719
01:02:20,381 --> 01:02:21,541
By the way...

720
01:02:22,750 --> 01:02:26,242
Your blood type,
A and O -- you're sure?

721
01:02:26,487 --> 01:02:27,351
Yes.

722
01:02:27,821 --> 01:02:28,810
Why do you ask?

723
01:02:29,723 --> 01:02:30,883
l... Excuse me.

724
01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:37,258
You see...

725
01:02:37,331 --> 01:02:38,958
... he's neither one nor the other.

726
01:02:39,466 --> 01:02:42,731
You're sure he's your son?
Not adopted?

727
01:02:42,803 --> 01:02:44,600
Yes, of course he's our son, Doctor.

728
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:46,405
Excuse me.

729
01:02:48,609 --> 01:02:49,633
l don't understand.

730
01:02:49,877 --> 01:02:51,310
What is there not to understand?

731
01:02:51,678 --> 01:02:52,940
He's neither one nor the other.

732
01:02:53,414 --> 01:02:54,676
Somebody else's blood is involved.

733
01:02:55,282 --> 01:02:55,976
What?!

734
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:58,350
You see he's neither
one nor the other.

735
01:02:58,719 --> 01:02:59,743
Abba...

736
01:03:07,694 --> 01:03:08,922
Look at his face.

737
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:11,154
Where am l in the face?

738
01:03:13,834 --> 01:03:16,394
That bloody nose.
l should have known.

739
01:03:16,570 --> 01:03:18,936
l will not let you
say such things about me!

740
01:03:19,606 --> 01:03:21,233
l'll kill myself!

741
01:03:32,586 --> 01:03:33,712
Baba?

742
01:03:35,322 --> 01:03:36,516
Baba?

743
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:42,629
l will make you all the
green chutney in the world.

744
01:04:00,681 --> 01:04:04,139
Excuse me, sir, would you
like to have something? Ma'am?

745
01:04:04,284 --> 01:04:05,444
No, thanks.

746
01:04:07,488 --> 01:04:09,285
Excuse me,
would you like to have something?

747
01:04:13,193 --> 01:04:16,685
My blood was wrong. My wrong blood

748
01:04:16,797 --> 01:04:19,163
turned my father's love to hate.

749
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:22,267
And though it caused
my mother much pain,

750
01:04:22,736 --> 01:04:24,260
l was sent away.

751
01:05:01,508 --> 01:05:03,476
Ah, Saleem. Right-o.

752
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,142
Let me be clear.

753
01:05:08,515 --> 01:05:11,484
My sister asked me to take you in,
l can't refuse...

754
01:05:11,652 --> 01:05:14,143
...whatever my own personal
inclinations may be.

755
01:05:14,555 --> 01:05:15,453
Welcome.

756
01:05:15,923 --> 01:05:17,322
Thank you, Emerald aunty.

757
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:21,494
Your cousin Zia will
show you the ropes.

758
01:05:21,562 --> 01:05:22,654
Zia?

759
01:05:25,832 --> 01:05:27,663
What did you do to get kicked out?

760
01:05:28,335 --> 01:05:29,802
l hear you still wet your pants.

761
01:05:30,637 --> 01:05:31,934
Watch it, snotty!

762
01:05:45,919 --> 01:05:47,216
Everything ready, Em?

763
01:05:47,588 --> 01:05:48,577
Yes, darling.

764
01:05:50,924 --> 01:05:52,221
The time is close now.

765
01:05:52,759 --> 01:05:53,783
Very well.

766
01:05:55,662 --> 01:05:57,357
Discretion is the watchword.

767
01:05:57,831 --> 01:05:58,827
Of course, darling.

768
01:05:59,132 --> 01:06:00,326
Dad, what's going on?

769
01:06:00,567 --> 01:06:01,556
Quiet!

770
01:06:04,638 --> 01:06:07,368
And you, boy. Here on sufferance.

771
01:06:07,741 --> 01:06:09,766
Don't act smart. Understood?

772
01:06:10,777 --> 01:06:12,267
And forget everything
you've just heard.

773
01:06:12,779 --> 01:06:14,144
Yes, Uncle Zulfi.

774
01:06:14,381 --> 01:06:17,544
Yes, sir, General Zulfikar.

775
01:06:18,485 --> 01:06:20,419
Yes, sir, General Zulfikar.

776
01:06:20,821 --> 01:06:22,379
''Uncle'' is hardly appropriate...

777
01:06:23,357 --> 01:06:24,585
...given the circs.

778
01:06:35,902 --> 01:06:36,926
Are you there?

779
01:06:37,437 --> 01:06:38,597
All of you, are you there?

780
01:06:39,673 --> 01:06:40,537
Yes!

781
01:06:41,174 --> 01:06:41,936
Hi, Parvati.

782
01:06:42,342 --> 01:06:43,309
Hello, Saleem.

783
01:06:43,543 --> 01:06:44,635
Any new tricks?

784
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:49,341
Abracadabra!

785
01:06:50,484 --> 01:06:51,416
Wow!

786
01:06:51,818 --> 01:06:54,378
l was born seven
seconds after midnight.

787
01:06:58,325 --> 01:06:59,553
This is too good!

788
01:06:59,793 --> 01:07:01,385
We've got to organize ourselves.

789
01:07:01,495 --> 01:07:03,292
Gangs need bosses, rich kid.

790
01:07:04,665 --> 01:07:06,326
l've been running a gang for years.

791
01:07:07,668 --> 01:07:09,659
lt's me that's bringing
you all together in my head.

792
01:07:09,736 --> 01:07:10,566
Yaar...

793
01:07:10,637 --> 01:07:11,729
...everyone does what l say.

794
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:12,736
Let Saleem be!

795
01:07:12,806 --> 01:07:13,864
Shut up. Hm!

796
01:07:14,908 --> 01:07:17,342
How are you doing all of this?

797
01:07:18,245 --> 01:07:20,179
lt's somehow because of this.

798
01:07:25,686 --> 01:07:26,880
One thousand and one.

799
01:07:27,387 --> 01:07:28,445
But...

800
01:07:28,755 --> 01:07:30,552
...four hundred and
twenty are already dead.

801
01:07:30,724 --> 01:07:32,214
And everyone else?

802
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:33,857
Do you know what they can do?

803
01:07:33,927 --> 01:07:35,895
ln Orissa, there is a girl,

804
01:07:36,229 --> 01:07:38,197
...and whoever sees
her falls in love with her.

805
01:07:38,832 --> 01:07:40,823
And you, from Goa!

806
01:07:41,635 --> 01:07:43,227
You can multiply fish!

807
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:45,266
And you, from Kerala!

808
01:07:45,672 --> 01:07:46,730
You can step through mirrors...

809
01:07:46,807 --> 01:07:48,775
...and reappear through
them wherever you want!

810
01:07:49,409 --> 01:07:50,376
And you...

811
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:52,171
...a werewolf from Nilgiri Hills!

812
01:07:52,245 --> 01:07:53,837
And you from the Vindhyas...

813
01:07:54,348 --> 01:07:55,815
...you can make yourself
bigger and smaller.

814
01:07:55,882 --> 01:07:57,440
And you can fly.

815
01:08:00,821 --> 01:08:04,313
So if we have these gifts, then...

816
01:08:04,391 --> 01:08:05,722
...we must ask why?

817
01:08:05,892 --> 01:08:07,450
There must be a reason, na?

818
01:08:07,561 --> 01:08:10,394
l think we should figure
it out and dedicate--

819
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:15,694
What's the reason that
you're rich and l'm poor?

820
01:08:15,902 --> 01:08:18,837
What's the reason l'm starving, man?
l'll tell you.

821
01:08:19,172 --> 01:08:21,663
You gotta get what you can,
do what you can with it,

822
01:08:21,742 --> 01:08:23,334
and then you gotta die.

823
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,302
That's the reason, rich kid!

824
01:08:25,846 --> 01:08:27,871
And everything else
is mother-sleeping wind.

825
01:08:27,914 --> 01:08:29,745
Stop it Shiva.
- Shut up, slut.

826
01:08:31,518 --> 01:08:33,782
l'm gonna take this
gang of freaks over.

827
01:08:34,521 --> 01:08:38,218
Not without me. Without me, they
won't even be able to listen to you.

828
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:39,891
Just try and stop me.

829
01:08:47,434 --> 01:08:49,425
Good evening. Please...

830
01:08:56,410 --> 01:08:57,342
Sir!

831
01:08:58,178 --> 01:09:00,738
Mr commander-in-chief,
be welcome in our home.

832
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:03,545
come, Emerald,
no need for such formalities.

833
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:04,641
Please...

834
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,284
You shouldn't be watching.

835
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:08,781
Neither should you.

836
01:09:14,227 --> 01:09:17,924
Wow! lf he's here,
then this is something really big.

837
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:19,358
Shh!

838
01:09:19,866 --> 01:09:21,527
What is the meaning of this?

839
01:09:22,469 --> 01:09:24,403
Perhaps they should
be permitted to attend.

840
01:09:25,305 --> 01:09:27,705
lt's their future that
we're making after all. come on.

841
01:09:27,774 --> 01:09:29,241
come on, boys.

842
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:33,946
Gentlemen, here, in our Pakistan,

843
01:09:34,781 --> 01:09:36,373
our Land of the Pure...

844
01:09:36,716 --> 01:09:38,843
...there is impurity on every side.

845
01:09:39,786 --> 01:09:41,481
Tonight, therefore on my command,

846
01:09:42,355 --> 01:09:43,720
we assume control of the State.

847
01:09:43,824 --> 01:09:44,882
Hear! Hear!

848
01:09:44,991 --> 01:09:47,323
Martial Law is imposed
with immediate effect.

849
01:09:47,761 --> 01:09:49,558
The constitution is abrogated.

850
01:09:50,263 --> 01:09:52,254
All political parties are abolished.

851
01:09:52,866 --> 01:09:54,561
General Zulfikar!
- Sir!

852
01:09:54,768 --> 01:09:56,668
Kindly map out the procedures.

853
01:09:56,703 --> 01:09:57,897
Sir.

854
01:09:58,839 --> 01:10:00,363
Zia! come here.

855
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:07,678
You, Saleem. come up here and help.

856
01:10:08,782 --> 01:10:09,806
Excuse me.

857
01:10:13,687 --> 01:10:14,949
At this moment...

858
01:10:15,755 --> 01:10:18,246
...the national radio
station has been surrounded...

859
01:10:18,358 --> 01:10:19,552
...by hand-picked units.

860
01:10:24,264 --> 01:10:25,424
Loyal armoured units...

861
01:10:25,565 --> 01:10:28,500
...are simultaneously seizing
control of the airport.

862
01:10:32,405 --> 01:10:33,633
Key points in the city...

863
01:10:35,609 --> 01:10:36,667
...are now secure.

864
01:10:39,813 --> 01:10:40,871
And finally...

865
01:10:41,515 --> 01:10:42,504
...crack troops...

866
01:10:42,649 --> 01:10:43,809
...have taken charge...

867
01:10:44,317 --> 01:10:45,716
...of the Presidential palace.

868
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:51,757
Gentlemen...

869
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:53,283
...the day is ours!

870
01:10:53,593 --> 01:10:54,525
Pakistan!

871
01:10:54,594 --> 01:10:55,822
Zindabad!

872
01:10:57,297 --> 01:11:00,198
Well done, young man.

873
01:11:12,445 --> 01:11:13,469
Mr President...

874
01:11:14,681 --> 01:11:15,807
You're a lucky man.

875
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,283
lt's only exile for you.

876
01:11:19,486 --> 01:11:24,423
''Only exile...?!'' ln exile,
l learned about power.

877
01:11:25,225 --> 01:11:27,785
After all, l had helped
to overthrow a government.

878
01:11:29,462 --> 01:11:31,794
Also l learned about loneliness.

879
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,858
Years with no friends...

880
01:11:36,436 --> 01:11:38,267
...except for Midnight's children.

881
01:11:39,706 --> 01:11:40,638
Aaah!

882
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:53,743
That dream again.

883
01:12:11,838 --> 01:12:14,466
come, please. All of you.

884
01:12:29,456 --> 01:12:31,788
Now what, cucumber-nose?

885
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:37,261
come on, Shiva. lt's time
for the conference, everyone.

886
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:38,258
Hi!

887
01:12:38,331 --> 01:12:40,891
Yaar not that story again.

888
01:12:42,569 --> 01:12:44,935
Haven't you worked out
that it's the same every time?

889
01:12:49,342 --> 01:12:51,572
''We must be here for a reason.

890
01:12:52,946 --> 01:12:54,777
We're all here for a higher purpose.

891
01:12:55,582 --> 01:12:56,480
Maybe...

892
01:12:56,683 --> 01:12:59,481
maybe we should just use
our powers to help our parents.''

893
01:13:04,624 --> 01:13:05,818
''No!''

894
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,228
''We must keep it a secret... shh...''

895
01:13:09,696 --> 01:13:11,755
''lf they find us,
they will come after us

896
01:13:11,898 --> 01:13:14,196
and they will kill us!''

897
01:13:16,670 --> 01:13:19,798
Huh? What do you suggest,
Mister ''l'm very strong?''

898
01:13:20,373 --> 01:13:21,305
Parvati.

899
01:13:21,641 --> 01:13:22,471
What's your bloody plan?

900
01:13:22,542 --> 01:13:23,873
Don't kill me with your broom.
- No, stop!

901
01:13:25,478 --> 01:13:26,740
Parvati.

902
01:13:27,213 --> 01:13:28,612
We all have to stay together, na?

903
01:13:29,282 --> 01:13:30,510
lsn't that right?

904
01:13:31,418 --> 01:13:34,251
l mean, don't you all see
everything else is breaking apart?

905
01:13:34,888 --> 01:13:39,348
Languages, religions, countries...

906
01:13:39,426 --> 01:13:42,395
We can show people
a new way of being.

907
01:13:42,462 --> 01:13:43,429
Get up.

908
01:13:44,431 --> 01:13:45,591
Shiva!

909
01:13:49,769 --> 01:13:50,793
Now listen to me.

910
01:13:54,607 --> 01:13:57,303
Nobody can stop us. Hm?

911
01:14:02,716 --> 01:14:08,211
We can blind people. Make gold. Fly.

912
01:14:09,155 --> 01:14:10,918
Read minds. Dojaadu.

913
01:14:11,891 --> 01:14:13,415
How will they fight us?

914
01:14:14,227 --> 01:14:14,750
Get off...

915
01:14:14,828 --> 01:14:16,386
...we're not getting hitched.

916
01:14:18,498 --> 01:14:20,659
The world is not ideas rich kid.

917
01:14:22,902 --> 01:14:24,767
The world is things.

918
01:14:26,306 --> 01:14:28,740
lf you have things,
you have time to dream.

919
01:14:28,808 --> 01:14:31,675
Hm? lf you don't...

920
01:14:34,848 --> 01:14:36,315
...you fight.

921
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:39,475
No, Shiva. No, no fighting.

922
01:14:40,453 --> 01:14:44,446
Look, people aren't things, man.

923
01:14:44,758 --> 01:14:46,589
People need each other.

924
01:14:47,494 --> 01:14:51,453
And it's not about flying,
or blinding, or gold... or magic!

925
01:14:51,531 --> 01:14:52,930
And our powers aren't for fighting.

926
01:14:53,533 --> 01:14:54,500
lt's this.

927
01:14:54,567 --> 01:14:55,795
l'll beat the hell out of you.

928
01:14:55,869 --> 01:14:57,200
Shiva, stop!

929
01:14:57,337 --> 01:14:58,770
You don't understand.
They don't care about us!

930
01:14:58,838 --> 01:15:00,601
No fighting, guys! Please.

931
01:15:00,673 --> 01:15:01,765
l think Saleem's right!

932
01:15:02,876 --> 01:15:04,810
We should start a coup!

933
01:15:04,878 --> 01:15:06,812
No! Enough! No coup!

934
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:08,404
Shut up.
Hey, rich kid!

935
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:11,248
Agh!

936
01:15:11,317 --> 01:15:11,874
SHlVA.

937
01:15:13,219 --> 01:15:14,811
Shiva, don't do this. Stop!

938
01:15:16,189 --> 01:15:18,350
Try to understand, Shiva!
Don't do this!

939
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:22,625
Shut up.

940
01:15:22,695 --> 01:15:23,889
Shh. Shut up!

941
01:15:26,299 --> 01:15:28,426
How about l finish this right now!

942
01:15:30,203 --> 01:15:31,465
More?

943
01:15:31,638 --> 01:15:33,299
No!

944
01:15:35,508 --> 01:15:38,705
The Midnight's children
conference is hereby dissolved!

945
01:15:41,347 --> 01:15:42,439
lts constitution is abrogated!

946
01:15:42,515 --> 01:15:44,642
lts Assemblies are suspended!
l abolish it!

947
01:15:59,799 --> 01:16:01,357
Good morning, General Zulfikar.

948
01:16:08,541 --> 01:16:09,769
You wanted me, Emerald aunty?

949
01:16:10,176 --> 01:16:11,700
How long has it been now, Saleem?

950
01:16:12,612 --> 01:16:14,443
Quite a long time, you'll agree?

951
01:16:14,514 --> 01:16:15,378
Yes.

952
01:16:15,448 --> 01:16:17,507
Such a helpful boy. Love you.

953
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,854
l told your ma,
she must have you back.

954
01:16:23,823 --> 01:16:26,587
To be fair,
she's been on your side all along.

955
01:16:26,759 --> 01:16:31,355
Your pater wants to make
a fresh start here in Pakistan.

956
01:16:31,631 --> 01:16:32,859
So you'll be joining them...

957
01:16:33,399 --> 01:16:36,596
...at Alia's place, in Karachi.

958
01:16:40,373 --> 01:16:40,839
Oh!

959
01:16:40,907 --> 01:16:41,874
Oh, sorry!

960
01:16:41,941 --> 01:16:45,399
What are you doing?!
Out! ldiot, out of my sight!

961
01:16:45,478 --> 01:16:46,672
Yes, Emerald aunty.

962
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:56,683
cheerio, Uncle Zulfi!

963
01:17:29,614 --> 01:17:31,275
Did your aunty feed you properly?

964
01:17:31,351 --> 01:17:32,318
Her food is horrible.

965
01:17:32,385 --> 01:17:35,252
l missed your cooking so much.
Green chutney.

966
01:17:35,288 --> 01:17:37,085
Baba...

967
01:17:40,026 --> 01:17:41,254
She didn't come, Mary?

968
01:17:42,295 --> 01:17:44,320
She's waiting at home. Let's go.

969
01:17:46,165 --> 01:17:47,029
Give it to me.

970
01:18:21,601 --> 01:18:22,465
My child.

971
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:25,264
Ammi.

972
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:33,504
Terrible things happen
in life and we don't know how.

973
01:18:35,648 --> 01:18:36,637
Forgive me.

974
01:18:49,529 --> 01:18:54,228
Be kind to your abba.
He's not been very happy these days.

975
01:19:02,175 --> 01:19:03,335
Hello, Abba.

976
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,052
Abba. Hi.

977
01:19:34,140 --> 01:19:35,004
Hi, Saleem.

978
01:19:35,374 --> 01:19:36,363
Hi.

979
01:19:37,577 --> 01:19:38,635
Welcome back.

980
01:19:39,212 --> 01:19:40,304
Thank you.

981
01:19:42,582 --> 01:19:43,276
come.

982
01:19:53,459 --> 01:19:54,585
What happened to me, Mary?

983
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:56,025
How can my blood be wrong?

984
01:19:56,095 --> 01:19:57,960
Nothing wrong with your blood.

985
01:19:59,465 --> 01:20:00,659
lt's my mother's fault.

986
01:20:00,933 --> 01:20:02,059
Don't say that.

987
01:20:02,335 --> 01:20:03,495
She was with other men.

988
01:20:03,569 --> 01:20:04,900
Shut up, baba!

989
01:20:05,071 --> 01:20:07,972
l saw it Mary. l saw it all.

990
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:44,141
Please, Joe. Help me.

991
01:20:53,653 --> 01:20:56,053
Ah, Jamila the singing
star has arrived.

992
01:20:56,489 --> 01:20:58,184
She sings very well.

993
01:20:58,491 --> 01:20:59,389
Thank you, abba.

994
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:00,455
You're welcome, darling.

995
01:21:05,298 --> 01:21:07,027
Five-letter word for ''singer''...

996
01:21:11,204 --> 01:21:13,866
Mary. A little more toast, please.
- Ah, ''tenor''.

997
01:21:16,142 --> 01:21:17,973
Sir. Madam.

998
01:21:19,011 --> 01:21:20,069
Madam, please.

999
01:21:22,014 --> 01:21:23,379
What's wrong, Mary?

1000
01:21:30,189 --> 01:21:31,451
What happened?

1001
01:21:35,094 --> 01:21:36,356
Baba is not your son.

1002
01:21:37,230 --> 01:21:38,629
He's Winkie and Vanita's son.

1003
01:21:39,265 --> 01:21:40,289
No, he is not.

1004
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,627
Vanita's child's father is not Winkie.

1005
01:21:44,136 --> 01:21:46,127
lt's that... that Englishman...

1006
01:21:46,372 --> 01:21:47,999
- Methwold.
- Methwold.

1007
01:21:48,307 --> 01:21:51,538
He's gone back to England
and poor Vanita, she's dead now.

1008
01:21:51,611 --> 01:21:53,306
She died at midnight.

1009
01:21:53,479 --> 01:21:55,071
l was there, Madam.

1010
01:21:56,382 --> 01:21:59,112
l gave your child to her...

1011
01:21:59,185 --> 01:22:00,982
...and hers to you.

1012
01:22:02,888 --> 01:22:03,946
Sorry, Madam.

1013
01:22:10,196 --> 01:22:12,323
Your son is Shiva.

1014
01:22:14,066 --> 01:22:16,034
Not a nice boy at all.

1015
01:22:17,169 --> 01:22:18,431
l'm sorry, Madam.

1016
01:22:19,338 --> 01:22:21,431
Let the rich be poor... Poor, rich.

1017
01:22:21,507 --> 01:22:22,064
Mary.

1018
01:22:22,875 --> 01:22:25,844
Please, just... leave now.

1019
01:22:31,284 --> 01:22:32,251
Baba.

1020
01:22:32,985 --> 01:22:35,180
l love you, baba. Like my own son.

1021
01:22:46,232 --> 01:22:47,961
No! No!

1022
01:22:48,034 --> 01:22:48,625
Stop it, abba!

1023
01:22:49,068 --> 01:22:49,898
Let him go!

1024
01:22:49,969 --> 01:22:50,492
Stop it, abba!

1025
01:22:54,940 --> 01:22:55,907
Bastard.

1026
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:59,639
Get him out of my
sight before l kill him.

1027
01:23:04,016 --> 01:23:04,539
No.

1028
01:23:06,986 --> 01:23:07,953
What did you say?

1029
01:23:08,888 --> 01:23:10,321
He will not go.

1030
01:23:13,159 --> 01:23:14,183
No!

1031
01:23:15,127 --> 01:23:17,493
Once before you sent him
away and l didn't want him to go.

1032
01:23:18,931 --> 01:23:21,092
Love is not just born, it's made.

1033
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,163
He is my child!

1034
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:27,171
lf he goes, l'll go.

1035
01:23:35,348 --> 01:23:38,146
Despite the revelation
of the midnight swap...

1036
01:23:38,517 --> 01:23:42,578
...never once did l have any desire
to search for the Englishman, Methwold

1037
01:23:43,589 --> 01:23:45,454
And never once, to my knowledge...

1038
01:23:45,524 --> 01:23:49,290
...did Ammi and Abba set out to
look for the true son of their blood.

1039
01:23:51,497 --> 01:23:54,364
l like to think,
that in spite of all the heartache...

1040
01:23:55,301 --> 01:23:56,859
...my parents loved me.

1041
01:23:59,572 --> 01:24:00,436
Parvati?

1042
01:24:04,243 --> 01:24:05,335
Saleem?

1043
01:24:08,981 --> 01:24:10,812
Where were you? - l know who l am now.

1044
01:24:15,888 --> 01:24:17,378
l'm not my ammi's son.

1045
01:24:20,593 --> 01:24:21,821
What do you mean?

1046
01:24:34,206 --> 01:24:35,400
Then her child is...

1047
01:24:39,311 --> 01:24:41,074
Saleem, he'll kill you.

1048
01:24:41,347 --> 01:24:42,541
You stole his life.

1049
01:24:42,615 --> 01:24:45,880
lt's not your fault.
- He must never know.

1050
01:24:54,527 --> 01:24:55,459
Excuse me.

1051
01:25:09,341 --> 01:25:10,433
Abba...

1052
01:25:10,843 --> 01:25:12,174
...what are we doing here?

1053
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:15,804
Abba, why have you brought me here?

1054
01:25:16,882 --> 01:25:17,940
come with me, Saleem.

1055
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:19,979
No, l'm not coming.

1056
01:25:20,486 --> 01:25:21,817
- Saleem...
- l'm not coming.

1057
01:25:22,188 --> 01:25:24,281
No! Why am l here?

1058
01:25:26,025 --> 01:25:28,550
Look, can't we just talk
about this like grown-ups?

1059
01:25:29,261 --> 01:25:31,058
They mustn't touch my nose, okay.
Do you understand?

1060
01:25:31,130 --> 01:25:32,222
- Sit down!
- No, no, no.

1061
01:25:32,298 --> 01:25:33,094
Take him away.

1062
01:25:33,165 --> 01:25:34,598
You understand,
Abba, they mustn't touch my...

1063
01:25:34,867 --> 01:25:36,528
You hear that? You are not to touch my
nose!

1064
01:25:37,837 --> 01:25:39,270
Abba! Abba!

1065
01:25:41,273 --> 01:25:42,399
Listen to me. Don't.

1066
01:25:42,475 --> 01:25:43,567
You don't know what you are doing.

1067
01:25:43,843 --> 01:25:46,073
You can't!
Look, look, you cannot touch my nose.

1068
01:25:46,212 --> 01:25:49,010
- lt's okay.
- Please, don't! You don't know!

1069
01:25:49,081 --> 01:25:51,914
Just be a good fellow
and count to ten.

1070
01:25:52,117 --> 01:25:57,487
Ten. Nine. Eight. Seven. Six...

1071
01:25:57,957 --> 01:26:02,621
Five. Four. Three. Two.

1072
01:26:03,128 --> 01:26:05,528
One. That's it.

1073
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:15,236
Saleem?

1074
01:26:41,534 --> 01:26:42,398
Are you there?

1075
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,204
All of you?

1076
01:26:50,676 --> 01:26:51,904
Parvati?

1077
01:26:55,214 --> 01:26:58,047
Parvati? Where are you?

1078
01:26:59,618 --> 01:27:00,448
lt's me.

1079
01:27:00,619 --> 01:27:03,315
They've all gone.
l can't call them anymore.

1080
01:27:03,455 --> 01:27:04,979
Who's gone? Who's Parvati?

1081
01:27:05,057 --> 01:27:06,024
Everybody.

1082
01:27:06,292 --> 01:27:08,920
Saleem. Just relax.

1083
01:27:19,071 --> 01:27:20,095
Jamila?

1084
01:27:20,873 --> 01:27:22,636
- Hey, put that back!
- No, no, Jamila.

1085
01:27:24,577 --> 01:27:26,477
l can smell.

1086
01:27:28,047 --> 01:27:29,071
Through that, you can smell?

1087
01:27:29,148 --> 01:27:31,946
Yes, l can smell everything.

1088
01:27:32,518 --> 01:27:33,450
What can you smell?

1089
01:27:34,119 --> 01:27:36,280
l can smell yourjasmine.

1090
01:27:37,389 --> 01:27:39,983
l can smell traffic on the street.

1091
01:27:40,559 --> 01:27:41,548
l can smell medicine.

1092
01:27:41,594 --> 01:27:44,324
l can smell other things, like...

1093
01:27:45,998 --> 01:27:46,965
...Love.

1094
01:27:48,267 --> 01:27:49,234
Jamila...

1095
01:27:50,936 --> 01:27:52,631
l can smell love.

1096
01:27:55,574 --> 01:27:56,563
Saleem...

1097
01:28:55,668 --> 01:28:57,465
There's going to be a big war,
you know.

1098
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:59,399
Yeah? So?

1099
01:28:59,605 --> 01:29:01,197
Yeah so!

1100
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,039
So which side are we on?

1101
01:29:03,108 --> 01:29:04,473
l know which side l'm on.

1102
01:29:04,977 --> 01:29:08,378
You're the one who's confused
-- with your Bombay this, Bombay that.

1103
01:29:08,447 --> 01:29:10,381
- l'm not confused.
- Aren't you?

1104
01:29:13,452 --> 01:29:14,851
Maybe.

1105
01:31:21,213 --> 01:31:23,272
War draws closer every minute.

1106
01:31:23,448 --> 01:31:25,507
The lndian enemy rises in strength.

1107
01:31:26,018 --> 01:31:27,849
But we too are strong...

1108
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:31,548
...and beti,
your voice will make us stronger.

1109
01:31:32,090 --> 01:31:34,456
lt will inspire our
soldiers to victory!

1110
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:52,576
crazed by the war fought by both the
countries to which l had belonged...

1111
01:31:53,912 --> 01:31:55,573
...l rode the night
streets of Karachi...

1112
01:31:55,647 --> 01:31:56,409
Stop!

1113
01:31:56,581 --> 01:31:57,343
Final warning!

1114
01:31:57,549 --> 01:31:58,982
...looking for death.

1115
01:32:00,886 --> 01:32:02,877
What are you doing!
Bring him! Bring him! Bring him!

1116
01:32:02,955 --> 01:32:04,479
Because of me you see!
Because of my crime.

1117
01:32:05,123 --> 01:32:05,919
What crime?

1118
01:32:05,991 --> 01:32:07,925
lt's nothing, yaar.
The poor man is cracked.

1119
01:32:07,993 --> 01:32:10,120
The bombs are looking for me..
- Take it easy, okay.

1120
01:32:10,195 --> 01:32:11,560
And don't ride that thing anymore.

1121
01:32:44,963 --> 01:32:48,262
Everything is tickety-boo.

1122
01:33:29,528 --> 01:33:31,758
Most of my family died in that war.

1123
01:33:32,564 --> 01:33:34,725
l, orphaned, survived.

1124
01:33:35,734 --> 01:33:39,830
For six years, l slept,
brained by a silver spittoon.

1125
01:33:40,038 --> 01:33:42,506
Wiped clean, remembering nothing.

1126
01:33:48,547 --> 01:33:53,644
After six years, l awoke,
and was shipped off to another war.

1127
01:33:53,718 --> 01:33:54,810
Torch, please.

1128
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:57,921
This time, a civil war.

1129
01:33:58,690 --> 01:33:59,816
Awake, are we?

1130
01:33:59,925 --> 01:34:02,485
Right on time to get
shipped off to East Pakistan.

1131
01:34:02,561 --> 01:34:07,123
Pakistan's East Wing fighting for
its independence against the West.

1132
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:28,920
Shahid.

1133
01:34:29,688 --> 01:34:30,746
Shahid.

1134
01:34:36,161 --> 01:34:37,560
No memory

1135
01:34:39,030 --> 01:34:42,158
Refuses to talk.
All he's good for is sniffing, yaar.

1136
01:34:43,134 --> 01:34:45,159
--He gives me the creeps, yaar.
--creeps?

1137
01:34:47,739 --> 01:34:48,831
Hear that? Empty.

1138
01:34:48,907 --> 01:34:49,999
Nobody's home.

1139
01:34:52,010 --> 01:34:52,942
Asshole.

1140
01:35:03,588 --> 01:35:07,080
ln three short weeks,
Pakistan had lost half its navy

1141
01:35:07,626 --> 01:35:10,754
a third of its army, and a
quarter of its air force.

1142
01:35:12,130 --> 01:35:15,691
By the time l tumbled into the war,
it was all over.

1143
01:35:24,676 --> 01:35:28,578
EAST PAKlSTAN 1971

1144
01:38:11,075 --> 01:38:11,973
General.

1145
01:38:21,953 --> 01:38:23,443
Good. That's that.

1146
01:38:24,489 --> 01:38:26,457
l'm sorry for your
loss in the battle, Zulfi.

1147
01:38:28,126 --> 01:38:29,115
Thank you, sir.

1148
01:38:30,995 --> 01:38:31,859
Shiva.

1149
01:38:33,698 --> 01:38:37,099
Our most decorated officer.
He fought quite a battle

1150
01:38:37,535 --> 01:38:38,502
Good show, major.

1151
01:38:39,604 --> 01:38:40,502
Zulfi.

1152
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:52,675
When General Zulfikar
surrendered to his old friend,

1153
01:38:52,750 --> 01:38:54,547
General Aurora of lndia...

1154
01:38:54,953 --> 01:38:58,013
...Pakistan also lost more
than half its population...

1155
01:38:58,489 --> 01:39:00,980
...who became citizens
of Bangladesh.

1156
01:39:02,160 --> 01:39:05,994
ln those days, all our
wars were fights between friends.

1157
01:39:11,636 --> 01:39:15,800
Magicians had been brought from
lndia to entertain the crowds...

1158
01:39:15,874 --> 01:39:19,139
...and that day,
everyone believed in magic.

1159
01:39:20,912 --> 01:39:23,904
DAccA, BANGLADESH 1971

1160
01:39:44,235 --> 01:39:45,167
Parvati.

1161
01:39:45,737 --> 01:39:46,761
Parvati.

1162
01:39:47,205 --> 01:39:49,867
Parvati the witch! Parvati!

1163
01:39:50,708 --> 01:39:53,233
Parvati! Parvati the witch!

1164
01:39:55,213 --> 01:39:56,237
Parvati!

1165
01:39:59,083 --> 01:40:00,107
Saleem?

1166
01:40:00,551 --> 01:40:01,677
Saleem?

1167
01:40:03,087 --> 01:40:05,681
Saleem! That's it!

1168
01:40:06,724 --> 01:40:08,715
And l thought l was
dreaming the whole thing.

1169
01:40:11,095 --> 01:40:11,959
come!

1170
01:40:12,664 --> 01:40:13,926
come up.

1171
01:40:36,821 --> 01:40:38,152
Abracadabra.

1172
01:40:38,655 --> 01:40:39,917
Abracadabra.

1173
01:40:40,191 --> 01:40:41,453
Abracadabra.

1174
01:40:47,765 --> 01:40:50,233
Hey, you there! Hurry up, they're
boarding the plane.

1175
01:40:50,802 --> 01:40:51,632
Sir.

1176
01:40:57,742 --> 01:40:58,766
What's in this?

1177
01:40:59,143 --> 01:41:02,112
Don't disturb her.
lt's a personal snake.

1178
01:41:04,015 --> 01:41:04,913
And this one?

1179
01:41:04,983 --> 01:41:06,712
lt's empty, sir. Take a look.

1180
01:41:09,153 --> 01:41:10,051
Very good.

1181
01:41:10,488 --> 01:41:12,115
Gather your belongings and board the
aircraft.

1182
01:41:12,991 --> 01:41:14,015
ls it okay?

1183
01:41:29,907 --> 01:41:34,139
And so it came to pass that without
passport or permit...

1184
01:41:34,645 --> 01:41:39,742
...l returned in Parvati's basket of
invisibility to lndia.

1185
01:41:40,885 --> 01:41:44,150
My lndia. The land of my birth.

1186
01:41:44,956 --> 01:41:48,551
DELHl, lNDlA 1972

1187
01:42:10,615 --> 01:42:15,484
Abracadabra. Abracadabra.
Abracadabra.

1188
01:43:42,607 --> 01:43:43,073
Yes.

1189
01:43:50,481 --> 01:43:51,470
Bye, Saleem.

1190
01:43:51,549 --> 01:43:51,844
Bye.

1191
01:43:51,916 --> 01:43:53,076
''Picture Singh...''

1192
01:43:53,818 --> 01:43:56,719
''...the Most charming
Man in the World...''

1193
01:43:57,488 --> 01:44:01,219
''charm your friends with
that Eastman Kodak.'' That's me.

1194
01:44:03,961 --> 01:44:04,928
captain.

1195
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:08,596
Parvati is a good girl.

1196
01:44:09,467 --> 01:44:10,934
Very sensible girl.

1197
01:44:12,069 --> 01:44:13,400
But she's an orphan.

1198
01:44:14,972 --> 01:44:17,406
She's your good friend.

1199
01:44:18,509 --> 01:44:20,807
How to take care of her?

1200
01:44:23,581 --> 01:44:25,879
Any idea?

1201
01:44:32,690 --> 01:44:33,782
Picture-ji...

1202
01:44:35,826 --> 01:44:36,884
Do you want tea?

1203
01:44:37,094 --> 01:44:38,459
Tea.

1204
01:44:38,596 --> 01:44:39,460
Then go make some.

1205
01:44:41,199 --> 01:44:41,961
Okay.

1206
01:44:44,669 --> 01:44:45,499
No.

1207
01:44:45,636 --> 01:44:46,534
No.

1208
01:44:46,904 --> 01:44:47,836
Karan, don't.

1209
01:45:11,562 --> 01:45:12,756
Abracadabra.

1210
01:45:24,108 --> 01:45:26,736
Finally, l have someone
who knows my magic is real.

1211
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:29,842
Why don't you tell the others?

1212
01:45:31,716 --> 01:45:32,842
Have you ever met...

1213
01:45:33,784 --> 01:45:36,685
...magicians who
believe in real magic?

1214
01:45:39,056 --> 01:45:40,956
They don't want witches around here.

1215
01:45:43,427 --> 01:45:44,689
Not even Picture Singh?

1216
01:45:49,166 --> 01:45:50,656
Not even Picture Singh.

1217
01:46:13,958 --> 01:46:15,482
Midnight's children.

1218
01:46:16,827 --> 01:46:20,456
You and me. That's something else.

1219
01:46:58,202 --> 01:46:59,169
Parvati.

1220
01:47:02,907 --> 01:47:06,240
--Parvati, please talk to me.
--No, you talk to me, Saleem!

1221
01:47:10,514 --> 01:47:12,846
lt... it changes.

1222
01:47:17,521 --> 01:47:18,453
l'm sorry.

1223
01:47:22,626 --> 01:47:23,957
Are you too grand for me?

1224
01:47:24,028 --> 01:47:25,962
Remember l know a secret about you.

1225
01:47:29,734 --> 01:47:30,996
You haven't told anyone.

1226
01:47:31,502 --> 01:47:32,469
l could have.

1227
01:47:33,738 --> 01:47:34,830
l met the other one.

1228
01:47:35,139 --> 01:47:36,037
The other one?

1229
01:47:36,607 --> 01:47:37,665
The one you're scared of.

1230
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:42,944
He was there at the victory parade.
The biggest hero of the whole war.

1231
01:47:44,181 --> 01:47:45,170
Your old buddy.

1232
01:47:46,984 --> 01:47:48,781
--You met him?
--Yes.

1233
01:47:50,755 --> 01:47:51,779
And you told him.

1234
01:47:53,190 --> 01:47:53,986
No.

1235
01:47:56,227 --> 01:47:57,751
But maybe l should send for him.

1236
01:47:58,996 --> 01:48:00,088
Send for him?

1237
01:48:01,065 --> 01:48:02,555
And you think he'll come to you?

1238
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,258
To hell with you!

1239
01:48:23,120 --> 01:48:24,610
No further, Picture-ji.

1240
01:48:57,188 --> 01:49:00,055
come to me. Abracadabra.

1241
01:49:02,092 --> 01:49:03,184
come to me.

1242
01:49:04,094 --> 01:49:07,325
NUcLEAR TEST, lNDlA 1974

1243
01:49:32,836 --> 01:49:35,600
certain ironies must
not pass unnoticed,

1244
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,674
for had not Shiva risen as l fell?

1245
01:49:39,877 --> 01:49:41,742
Which of us became a slum-dweller,

1246
01:49:42,547 --> 01:49:46,608
and who was the hero; the most
powerful of Midnight's children?

1247
01:49:47,818 --> 01:49:49,615
There's nothing like war...

1248
01:49:50,421 --> 01:49:52,446
...for the reinvention of lives.

1249
01:49:56,427 --> 01:49:59,419
Who are you, hmm? Woman?

1250
01:50:00,531 --> 01:50:01,725
l'm the witch.

1251
01:50:01,832 --> 01:50:03,356
Mmhm.

1252
01:50:04,535 --> 01:50:06,435
Another Midnight's child.

1253
01:50:12,743 --> 01:50:14,108
You.

1254
01:50:14,879 --> 01:50:16,437
l have nothing to say to you.

1255
01:50:17,348 --> 01:50:18,679
l'm leaving.

1256
01:50:19,584 --> 01:50:21,245
come back to me.

1257
01:50:42,373 --> 01:50:43,340
Hey!

1258
01:50:48,179 --> 01:50:49,271
Saleem.

1259
01:50:54,151 --> 01:50:55,345
Woof woof.

1260
01:50:57,655 --> 01:51:01,386
How much is that
doggie in the window?.

1261
01:51:01,792 --> 01:51:05,922
l do hope that doggie's for sale

1262
01:51:32,523 --> 01:51:34,650
l had many families and no family.

1263
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:38,388
There were the parents
l never knew who gave me life.

1264
01:51:39,363 --> 01:51:42,161
And the parents who raised me,
whom l lost.

1265
01:51:43,134 --> 01:51:47,161
And Midnight's children,
who were taken from me for a time.

1266
01:51:48,539 --> 01:51:52,600
l wandered among them all,
and at last l was ready.

1267
01:52:24,275 --> 01:52:26,573
l called him because
l was angry with you.

1268
01:52:27,211 --> 01:52:28,200
l know.

1269
01:52:33,250 --> 01:52:34,774
He left his child with me.

1270
01:52:36,120 --> 01:52:39,886
Parvati. Maybe it's not his child.

1271
01:52:41,225 --> 01:52:42,453
What do you mean?

1272
01:52:44,428 --> 01:52:46,453
When we get married,
it will be ours.

1273
01:52:47,498 --> 01:52:48,362
What?

1274
01:52:48,566 --> 01:52:51,797
When we get married, it'll be ours.

1275
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:37,773
Your face.

1276
01:54:41,048 --> 01:54:42,481
What about my face now?.

1277
01:54:42,582 --> 01:54:44,049
Nothing...

1278
01:54:46,323 --> 01:54:49,781
Parvati, it's so beautiful.

1279
01:55:00,258 --> 01:55:04,285
June 12, 1975, will be
remembered as a historic date.

1280
01:55:04,562 --> 01:55:06,359
At 2:15 this afternoon

1281
01:55:06,397 --> 01:55:09,594
the Prime Minister was found
guilty of electoral malpractice.

1282
01:55:10,368 --> 01:55:13,030
From a specially built podium, Mrs.
Gandhi told

1283
01:55:13,104 --> 01:55:14,537
the crowd that she was a victim...

1284
01:55:15,173 --> 01:55:16,765
''Emergency.''

1285
01:55:17,208 --> 01:55:20,473
The word ''Emergency''
was heard for the first time.

1286
01:55:20,545 --> 01:55:21,705
Saleem!

1287
01:55:24,514 --> 01:55:29,042
The censorship of the press,
arrest of subversive elements...

1288
01:55:29,850 --> 01:55:31,909
...and forced sterilization.

1289
01:55:32,498 --> 01:55:36,832
Some things were ending,
something was being born.

1290
01:55:36,902 --> 01:55:38,233
Saleem!

1291
01:55:38,437 --> 01:55:40,837
lt's a baby boy!

1292
01:55:52,718 --> 01:55:57,314
Look at your ears, they're so big!

1293
01:55:58,948 --> 01:56:00,415
Who knows what things you'll hear?

1294
01:56:02,218 --> 01:56:03,515
Aadam.

1295
01:56:04,487 --> 01:56:06,284
Aadam Sinai.

1296
01:56:07,290 --> 01:56:09,190
Anything you want...

1297
01:56:09,325 --> 01:56:11,919
...to be, you can be...

1298
01:56:13,162 --> 01:56:15,062
You can be...

1299
01:56:15,965 --> 01:56:18,559
...just whatever you want.

1300
01:56:47,230 --> 01:56:49,357
With the declaration
of the ''Emergency,''

1301
01:56:51,167 --> 01:56:57,436
and the birth of a new,
unfree lndia, a dark night fell.

1302
01:57:00,042 --> 01:57:02,442
A continuous midnight
that would last...

1303
01:57:02,979 --> 01:57:04,207
...for years.

1304
01:57:07,383 --> 01:57:11,376
What's happening?
Where is the daylight?

1305
01:57:13,022 --> 01:57:15,513
A curse has come upon us.

1306
01:57:17,193 --> 01:57:19,184
l have never seen such a thing.

1307
01:57:26,035 --> 01:57:28,162
No doubt about it, Madam.

1308
01:57:28,371 --> 01:57:32,933
Your horoscope clearly states that
you are one with the Motherland.

1309
01:57:33,709 --> 01:57:36,075
lndia is the Prime Minister,

1310
01:57:36,279 --> 01:57:38,270
Prime Minister is lndia.

1311
01:57:39,382 --> 01:57:42,317
And we started to think
of her as ''Devi''

1312
01:57:42,385 --> 01:57:45,047
''The Mother Goddess.''

1313
01:57:45,455 --> 01:57:49,448
Those who would be gods
fear all other potential deities.

1314
01:57:50,660 --> 01:57:52,685
And that's why she hated us.

1315
01:57:53,329 --> 01:57:55,354
The magical children of midnight.

1316
01:58:04,507 --> 01:58:06,998
lt is astrologically proven...

1317
01:58:07,343 --> 01:58:09,368
...a threat to the nation, Madam...

1318
01:58:10,246 --> 01:58:13,044
...is a threat to
the Prime Minister also.

1319
01:58:23,626 --> 01:58:24,991
Saleem?
- Huh?

1320
01:58:25,294 --> 01:58:27,023
Saleem?
- Huh?

1321
01:58:27,129 --> 01:58:28,494
Did you hear that?

1322
01:58:36,439 --> 01:58:39,306
A civic beautification has
been authorized in this sector.

1323
01:58:40,176 --> 01:58:43,407
This slum contains subversive
elements, it's an eyesore...

1324
01:58:43,479 --> 01:58:45,174
...and a public scandal.

1325
01:58:45,515 --> 01:58:48,075
All persons must vacate immediately!

1326
01:59:07,103 --> 01:59:09,333
Why are you doing this?

1327
01:59:12,575 --> 01:59:15,009
Parvati! Parvati! Aadam!

1328
01:59:15,077 --> 01:59:16,305
Go save them!

1329
01:59:25,321 --> 01:59:26,549
Parvati!

1330
01:59:27,657 --> 01:59:28,624
Shiva!

1331
01:59:28,991 --> 01:59:30,015
Rich kid.

1332
01:59:33,129 --> 01:59:34,221
Parvati!

1333
01:59:38,367 --> 01:59:41,200
Shiva! Shiva, stop!

1334
01:59:41,437 --> 01:59:43,234
Now tell me where
the other children are.

1335
01:59:44,707 --> 01:59:45,401
Parvati!

1336
01:59:45,474 --> 01:59:46,498
Where are they?
- Little Aadam!

1337
01:59:46,609 --> 01:59:48,008
He's your son!

1338
02:00:15,471 --> 02:00:16,631
Abracadabra.

1339
02:00:45,501 --> 02:00:47,196
The ''Emergency''...

1340
02:00:47,370 --> 02:00:52,137
...was necessary and justified.

1341
02:00:52,341 --> 02:00:57,438
Democracy was under threat.
lt had to be protected.

1342
02:01:04,086 --> 02:01:05,485
We think you're very dangerous.

1343
02:01:06,088 --> 02:01:08,215
Or what you might be capable of,
potentially.

1344
02:01:08,524 --> 02:01:10,048
What you're plotting to do.

1345
02:01:10,326 --> 02:01:13,090
Or might be plotting
at a future date.

1346
02:01:13,963 --> 02:01:15,430
We're going to nip you in the bud.

1347
02:01:15,498 --> 02:01:17,363
cut you off at the source.

1348
02:01:17,433 --> 02:01:19,993
Prevention is better than cure.

1349
02:01:20,336 --> 02:01:21,997
This is an ''Emergency.''

1350
02:01:22,071 --> 02:01:23,402
Your gang of freaks?

1351
02:01:24,006 --> 02:01:27,339
lt will have to be
smashed... With your help.

1352
02:01:27,643 --> 02:01:28,940
Of course.

1353
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:32,672
Names. Addresses.

1354
02:01:34,116 --> 02:01:35,583
Physical descriptions.

1355
02:01:36,052 --> 02:01:40,079
Nature of peculiar capabilities.
All of it.

1356
02:01:41,924 --> 02:01:43,084
Thank you in advance.

1357
02:01:43,426 --> 02:01:44,916
Thank you very much.

1358
02:01:46,996 --> 02:01:50,159
No. Never.

1359
02:01:59,408 --> 02:02:01,171
That wasn't too bad, was it?

1360
02:02:01,277 --> 02:02:02,335
Not so bad at all.

1361
02:02:04,013 --> 02:02:05,503
Shiva...

1362
02:02:06,282 --> 02:02:08,113
...he's really me.

1363
02:02:10,219 --> 02:02:12,551
You two, out.

1364
02:02:14,457 --> 02:02:15,185
Now!

1365
02:02:24,400 --> 02:02:25,628
What the hell are you talking about?

1366
02:02:26,135 --> 02:02:27,227
Hm?

1367
02:02:29,171 --> 02:02:30,638
Two babies.

1368
02:02:32,975 --> 02:02:34,340
Born together.

1369
02:02:35,077 --> 02:02:38,911
Same place, same time.

1370
02:02:39,448 --> 02:02:40,472
And?

1371
02:02:41,417 --> 02:02:46,946
Swapped, see? Swapped.

1372
02:02:52,394 --> 02:02:53,486
Speak up.

1373
02:02:59,568 --> 02:03:03,504
l stole your life.

1374
02:03:12,248 --> 02:03:13,943
Rich boy.

1375
02:03:17,186 --> 02:03:18,483
Bastard.

1376
02:03:18,888 --> 02:03:21,982
Saleem and Shiva. Shiva and Saleem.

1377
02:03:53,155 --> 02:03:56,488
Shiva. No! Stop!

1378
02:04:13,108 --> 02:04:16,100
Let them go!
Let them go! Let them go!

1379
02:04:26,188 --> 02:04:27,348
Forgive me.

1380
02:04:29,091 --> 02:04:32,254
l'm sorry to inform you
that we're obliged to operate.

1381
02:04:32,628 --> 02:04:35,153
Operate? What, what... what operation?

1382
02:04:35,231 --> 02:04:36,391
''Sperectomy.''

1383
02:04:43,939 --> 02:04:45,634
l'm going to take your life away...

1384
02:04:47,576 --> 02:04:52,240
...bit by bit, like you took mine.

1385
02:04:53,048 --> 02:04:56,950
No! Don't! No, stop! Stop!

1386
02:04:57,019 --> 02:05:00,182
Don't do this! Don't do this!

1387
02:05:02,091 --> 02:05:04,992
Stop... Stop. Stop.

1388
02:05:08,264 --> 02:05:09,288
Take the pyjama off.

1389
02:05:09,398 --> 02:05:11,593
The ''Emergency,'' everyone called it...

1390
02:05:12,101 --> 02:05:13,898
...but it was really a betrayal.

1391
02:05:14,203 --> 02:05:15,363
Her betrayal...

1392
02:05:15,437 --> 02:05:17,234
...of her father's dreams.

1393
02:05:18,240 --> 02:05:22,472
Who were we? We were
the promises of independence.

1394
02:05:32,388 --> 02:05:35,949
And like all promises,
made to be broken.

1395
02:05:36,892 --> 02:05:38,120
Vasectomy.

1396
02:05:39,495 --> 02:05:41,053
ln a stunning upset,

1397
02:05:41,130 --> 02:05:43,530
the Prime Minister
lndira Gandhi has been...

1398
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:46,363
...unceremoniously
flung out of office.

1399
02:05:46,936 --> 02:05:49,427
Sure of a triumph,
she called an election,

1400
02:05:49,505 --> 02:05:51,530
only to have it backfire on her.

1401
02:05:51,607 --> 02:05:54,337
The Emergency is over.

1402
02:07:18,994 --> 02:07:23,090
Four hundred and twenty of us stood,
blinking in the sunlight.

1403
02:07:24,933 --> 02:07:28,596
And then dispersed into
the healing privacy of the crowds.

1404
02:07:31,006 --> 02:07:32,200
And what of Shiva?

1405
02:07:33,108 --> 02:07:35,303
Shiva, who was now a wanted man.

1406
02:09:22,951 --> 02:09:24,282
Parvati...?

1407
02:09:27,122 --> 02:09:30,023
Unfortunately, she...

1408
02:09:35,297 --> 02:09:39,199
But captain... you have a son.

1409
02:09:40,169 --> 02:09:43,229
come. come with me.

1410
02:10:21,677 --> 02:10:23,372
come.

1411
02:10:35,023 --> 02:10:37,548
She didn't even use
her magic to save her life.

1412
02:10:39,528 --> 02:10:44,261
You see, Picture-ji, Parvati gave
up all of that before he was born.

1413
02:10:45,167 --> 02:10:47,067
She didn't give it up.

1414
02:10:48,270 --> 02:10:51,637
l found Aadam in her
basket of invisibility.

1415
02:10:52,441 --> 02:10:55,069
The soldiers looked
inside and shouted...

1416
02:10:55,143 --> 02:10:56,940
lt's empty! lt's empty!

1417
02:10:57,212 --> 02:10:59,112
l heard them with my own ears.

1418
02:11:00,082 --> 02:11:01,606
But you saw him?

1419
02:11:02,084 --> 02:11:05,713
l believed in her magic.

1420
02:11:06,989 --> 02:11:10,083
Always knew it was not a trick.

1421
02:11:18,433 --> 02:11:22,426
He's a fine child, child of dignity.

1422
02:11:24,640 --> 02:11:27,575
No matter he doesn't
speak but he will,

1423
02:11:28,010 --> 02:11:32,572
when he has something to say.

1424
02:11:42,224 --> 02:11:46,923
This chutney!
What's this? Where's it from?

1425
02:11:56,004 --> 02:11:57,232
Here, sir.

1426
02:11:58,707 --> 02:12:04,145
Oh! One from famous
Braganza Pickles of Bombay.

1427
02:12:07,983 --> 02:12:10,042
Picture-ji, we must go to Bombay.

1428
02:12:11,119 --> 02:12:12,347
Just now?.

1429
02:12:15,590 --> 02:12:16,614
Now.

1430
02:12:20,162 --> 02:12:21,891
Parvati was gone.

1431
02:12:23,231 --> 02:12:26,029
But in the five-syllable
monotony of the wheels,

1432
02:12:26,101 --> 02:12:28,069
l heard her magic spell.

1433
02:12:28,603 --> 02:12:31,333
''Abracadabra,
abracadabra, abracadabra,''...

1434
02:12:31,573 --> 02:12:35,907
...sang the wheels,
as they bore us back to Bombay.

1435
02:12:52,461 --> 02:12:53,985
ls Mrs Braganza here?

1436
02:12:54,062 --> 02:12:57,054
Yes, but you can't meet with her.
Where are you going?

1437
02:12:58,533 --> 02:12:59,522
Hello?

1438
02:13:13,048 --> 02:13:14,515
Who is it?

1439
02:13:25,227 --> 02:13:26,592
Saleem.

1440
02:13:29,531 --> 02:13:31,158
Oh...

1441
02:13:41,376 --> 02:13:45,210
You've become so thin.
Let me kiss you.

1442
02:13:54,456 --> 02:13:57,948
Mary, this is my son, Aadam.

1443
02:14:01,530 --> 02:14:02,963
And Aadam...

1444
02:14:18,613 --> 02:14:21,104
come here.

1445
02:14:24,453 --> 02:14:25,920
come, Little Baba.

1446
02:15:06,161 --> 02:15:09,187
Blow. Blow.

1447
02:15:23,478 --> 02:15:25,002
Happy birthday.

1448
02:15:26,314 --> 02:15:27,246
Bless you.

1449
02:15:34,189 --> 02:15:35,178
Abba...

1450
02:15:35,390 --> 02:15:36,322
He spoke!

1451
02:15:37,659 --> 02:15:39,217
He's speaking.

1452
02:15:40,128 --> 02:15:41,220
Abba...

1453
02:15:41,463 --> 02:15:43,021
My God.

1454
02:15:44,299 --> 02:15:46,028
He's calling me ''father''.

1455
02:15:46,635 --> 02:15:48,933
Speak son, speak.

1456
02:15:49,437 --> 02:15:51,371
...abracadabra.

1457
02:15:54,910 --> 02:15:56,605
What did you say?

1458
02:15:58,046 --> 02:15:59,911
Abracadabra.

1459
02:16:00,515 --> 02:16:03,177
Another magic child.

1460
02:16:06,655 --> 02:16:11,217
So. A new generation...
but more careful.

1461
02:16:12,928 --> 02:16:13,952
Tougher.

1462
02:16:21,436 --> 02:16:27,033
A child and a country were
born at midnight, once upon a time.

1463
02:16:28,310 --> 02:16:30,471
Great things were
expected of us both.

1464
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:34,947
The truth has been less
glorious than the dream.

1465
02:16:36,384 --> 02:16:39,251
But we have survived
and made our way.

1466
02:16:40,021 --> 02:16:43,013
And our lives have been,
in spite of everything,

1467
02:16:44,492 --> 02:16:45,618
acts of love.
