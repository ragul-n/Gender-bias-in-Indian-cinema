1
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,560
Why are you shouting?

2
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,080
Who are you?

3
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,280
I am frog.

4
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,880
Frog?

5
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,360
Yah, frog!

6
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,960
Are you not a human?

7
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,880
- Have you heard of frog in empty well? 
- Yes.

8
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
Have you seen it?

9
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No.

10
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,560
I am that.

11
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,800
Are you cheating me?

12
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,680
Shuck!

13
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,840
Think that you have been cheated. 
That's all.

14
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,840
Why did you jump in well?

15
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,120
Did anyone remove you from whatsapp 
group? Tell me.

16
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,080
I don't want to remain alive.

17
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,040
Why do you feel like that?

18
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,320
That...

19
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,680
He dumped me.

20
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,680
I am not angry with him.

21
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,360
But...without him...

22
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,960
I can't live without him.

23
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,040
So it is love failure, isn't it?

24
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,720
In present days are there 
people like you?

25
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,480
What should I do?

26
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,280
Dear, love is

27
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,160
not just an emotion.

28
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,880
There is a science behind that.

29
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,120
I'll tell you.

30
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,760
While we are in love,

31
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,440
an hormone will develop in 
our body.

32
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,120
What is the name of that...?

33
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,000
Oxytoxin.

34
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,120
According to the level of this hormone

35
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,120
love will increase and decrease.

36
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,520
Now you must be thinking

37
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,360
how does a frog know all this.

38
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,400
I am not a person as 
you are thinking.

39
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,880
I am something great.

40
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,520
Do you know, I am a man of 
divine power?

41
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,600
A person living with the 
support of God.

42
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,400
Not only in this well,

43
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
but I travel to many places.

44
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,480
In the name of divine power,

45
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,280
I get food and accommodation in 
many places.

46
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,640
I get to know many 
big shots there.

47
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,280
From them

48
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,480
I have gained lot of knowledge.

49
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,440
I got this knowledge about oxytoxin

50
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,680
from a psychiatrist.

51
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,480
What is the connection between 
that and my jumping in well?

52
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,520
It'll be a wonder 
only if you don't jump.

53
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,640
It is not the guy who dumped 
you who made you do this now.

54
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,880
It is the hormone in your body.

55
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,600
I don't understand anything.

56
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,960
For the time being you 
hold on there.

57
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,640
No use of telling her all this.

58
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,360
I'll start from a low level.

59
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,680
For girls if there is a love failure,

60
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
it is enough to jump in a well 
or find a noose.

61
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,760
Have you ever thought of men?

62
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,320
I know of a love story.

63
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,840
I am connected to it directly 
and indirectly.

64
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,760
In that, there is not one but two 
love stories.

65
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,040
There is still time for dawn.

66
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,680
It is good that you hear that.

67
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,360
This love story didn't start

68
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,960
in a coffee shop or a campus

69
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,680
but in a fish market.

70
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,560
You made them stink.

71
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,320
It happened by mistake.

72
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,920
Get some water.

73
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,840
Is it fish water to make them 
stink more?

74
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,040
He has become dirty.

75
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,680
His goggles are spoilt.

76
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
You come again.

77
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:02,400
'Grape Plant : A frog's narration'

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,640
"Stage... grape plant stage..."

79
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,440
"Stage... grape plant stage..."

80
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,280
"Stage... grape plant stage..."

81
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,200
"Stage... grape plant stage..."

82
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,000
"Smart shining moustache is beautiful."

83
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:49,400
"The cheeks are red like 
ripe grapes."

84
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:57,600
"On seeing a look... 
on giving a glance..."

85
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,600
"Seeing the walk... 
Seeing the height..."

86
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,920
"A trap is being spread with smile."

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,600
"A tender plant..."

88
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,240
"Is it a newly grown tender 
mango flower?"

89
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,760
"He is the hero in the stage."

90
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,360
"A suited match for the heroine."

91
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,080
"An attractive face. Heart throb 
of many girls."

92
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,720
"Is he the young son-in-law?"

93
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,200
"Stage... grape plant stage..."

94
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,200
"Stage... grape plant stage..."

95
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,840
"An ideal son..."

96
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,480
"He arrives on the venue by walk."

97
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,080
"He becomes the center of 
attraction in that."

98
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:30,040
"Girls surround him from 
all over."

99
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,080
"His arrival makes everyone wonder."

100
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Excuse me 
Brother what is the problem there?

101
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,360
It is the fight between two women.

102
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,840
Who the hell are you 
to teach me decency!

103
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,480
Don't make me tell your history.

104
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,600
Take this. 
- Move away!

105
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,600
Take this!

106
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,240
Son! 
- Yes.

107
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,000
- Anyway you are stinking of fish. 
- Is it?

108
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,400
You drop her home.

109
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,520
Okay.

110
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,960
Dear, hop in. 
He'll drop you.

111
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,840
Will you be here daily?

112
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,520
- I'll be there daily. 
- Okay.

113
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Get in.

114
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,600
- Is it here? 
- Yeah!

115
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,560
Why is it not lifting? 
Lift it.

116
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,640
- Hi! Were you sleeping? 
- Stop here.

117
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,480
- Here? 
- Yes.

118
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,720
Okay.

119
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,840
Thanks!

120
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,560
It is I who must thank you.

121
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,000
- Thanks! 
- Uh...

122
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,280
Why are you thanking me?

123
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,040
It is because you sat behind me

124
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,320
- that I could hide my dirty shirt. 
- Oh!

125
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,480
By the way...what is your name?

126
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,600
Ima.

127
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,360
- Ima... 
- Ima Rajiv.

128
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,680
- Ima Rajiv. 
- Hmm...

129
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,040
Is Rajiv your father

130
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,680
or the lucky man?

131
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,160
- Father. 
- Thank God!

132
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,680
Without asking I'll tell you.

133
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,200
Did this also come along?

134
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,360
Shuck!

135
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,440
Sorry!

136
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,960
Now it is cleaned. Take it.

137
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,560
It was not required.

138
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,240
Honestly my name is Vivek.

139
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,600
People fond of me address me as 'Vive'.

140
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,360
Oh...then how does people, not 
fond of you call you?

141
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,440
Is it 'Brother'?

142
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,960
'Brother'?

143
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,840
Don't call me that.

144
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,800
You call me as Vivek.

145
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,080
Uhm.

146
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,040
In car not only name but 
number is also there.

147
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,600
I know this is a trick.

148
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,720
What to do?

149
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,480
- Okay then, bye! 
- Bye!

150
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:40,200
"Mango draped in silk..."

151
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,640
One minute!

152
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
- What? 
- It is okay.

153
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,560
- This is a part of it. 
- Is it?

154
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,320
Then...you'll have to do some work.

155
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,600
To tackle her.

156
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,880
Oh God! What a person to 
attract her!

157
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,240
I'll deal with that.

158
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,800
What a tragedy!

159
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,360
It was not needed. I forgot that 
I am a watchman.

160
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,600
You know guys, as far as 
India is concerned

161
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,040
the biggest entertainment,

162
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,960
as per the survey it is cricket.

163
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,720
After that it is cinema.

164
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,960
When television was introduced

165
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,240
people said there won't be cinema 
here after.

166
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,280
Now television depends on movies.

167
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,680
Same way cinema is also depending on TV.

168
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,960
People prefer to see in bigger screens.

169
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,120
That is why they pay money...

170
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,280
and see advertisements in 
cinema halls.

171
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,200
There are many companies in 
Kerala alone which were

172
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,560
branded in theatre alone.

173
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,200
- Can I ask you one thing? 
- Sure, sir!

174
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,760
There are people who don't visit 
religious places.

175
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,720
What do we do by going there?

176
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,920
We pray.

177
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,080
We pray for whom?

178
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,280
For us and for people 
close to us, right?

179
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,760
I must earn money. 
My children should remain healthy.

180
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,240
My wife must get a job. Isn't this 
what we pray?

181
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,840
What if we visit cinema theatre?

182
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,880
Don't we pray for a character in 
a story that we like?

183
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,480
Save the hero.

184
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,960
Nothing should happen to the heroine.

185
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,680
It should be a happy ending. 
Like that.

186
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,240
What I am saying is, prayer is happening 
in both the places.

187
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,280
So, theatre is the only place

188
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,200
were we are praying for the others.

189
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,360
The most divine selfless peaceful place 
in the world is...

190
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,640
cinema hall.

191
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,040
Agree with me?

192
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,600
- Yes. 
- What is he talking?

193
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,680
Sir, may I...

194
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,320
- Come in. 
- Thanks, sir!

195
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,720
After saying all this, he is 
drinking water.

196
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,080
Where did we stop?

197
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,960
- Sir, religious place. 
- Okay right.

198
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
Vive!

199
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,200
What is the difference between 
religious place and cinema theatre?

200
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,600
Very simple.

201
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,240
To get peace of mind

202
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,560
we go to the religious place.

203
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,040
But it is with peace of mind

204
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,560
that we go to the theatre.

205
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,240
That is the difference.

206
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,680
Yes! Peace of mind.

207
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,040
Peace.

208
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,240
Where it is there, we can 
sell anything.

209
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,400
The audience which come to the 
carnival with peace,

210
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,880
from the ambiance that we provide

211
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,640
get involved in the cinema.

212
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,400
With that in the advertisements that 
we show.

213
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,560
It'll get business to the clients.

214
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,600
Anyway guys, go and 
meet your target.

215
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,760
- Yes, sir! 
- All the best!

216
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,240
- Okay? 
- Okay, sir.

217
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,440
You go ahead. 
I have to collect something.

218
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,240
What is it?

219
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,560
Things are very slow.

220
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,800
After the flood no clients 
are coming up.

221
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,600
I know the matter.

222
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,200
But I can't tell this to the 
new staffs.

223
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,680
You try to clear the maximum 
outstanding.

224
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,320
I don't have to mention about cash.

225
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,720
Clients cheques are 
going on bouncing.

226
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,280
Avoid agency and try to get 
some direct agency.

227
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,880
Give offer in off screen and 
on screen.

228
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,320
Mumbai is not having 
any flood like Kerala.

229
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,240
I have extreme pressure.

230
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,440
- You try to do something. 
- Okay sir.

231
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,840
Let the work go on.

232
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,880
Just now I mentioned about pressure.

233
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,360
Hello, sir!

234
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
Okay, sir.

235
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:03,960
Deal, sir.

236
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,760
Sure, sir. Sure.

237
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,480
I'll take care of it. Okay.

238
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,480
There is no spicy news in Malayalam.

239
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,160
Rent a read. The icon of 
innovative thoughts.

240
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,160
You thief!

241
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:30,960
So you were an intellectual, isn't it?

242
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,240
Rent a read.

243
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,320
I'll bring her in cinema screen.

244
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Okay.

245
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,600
Rent a read.

246
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,720
Reached final destination.

247
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,280
Government need not be blamed.

248
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,520
I should have used helmet.

249
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,640
It is my fault. 
Only my fault.

250
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,520
Hey, guy! Is it your vehicle?

251
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,880
- No. 
- Move aside.

252
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,760
- What is this? 
- Let me see.

253
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,080
How is it? Is it good?

254
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,840
- Excellent. 
- You'll prosper.

255
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,880
Got a book on rent.

256
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,560
Rent a read...

257
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,240
Careful!

258
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,960
Give way to this uncle.

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,520
- There are many readers for this book. 
- There it is.

260
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,360
I'll get some more copies.

261
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,720
By the way, I read the article.

262
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,120
Congrates!

263
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,280
Thank you!

264
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,040
You are a scholar, isn't it?

265
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,960
Hmm...

266
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,000
On which year did this 
company start?

267
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,560
Last year. Why?

268
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,480
Nothing. Foot falls are not 
as expected.

269
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,800
This company needs to reach to 
the people.

270
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,800
The reach is not at all good.

271
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,520
Necessary reach is there.

272
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,840
More than enough.

273
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,000
- Don't we need to leave? Meeting. 
- Please!

274
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,760
Give me 5 minutes on rent.

275
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,880
Okay, don't exceed 5 minutes.

276
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,400
Okay.

277
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,760
Ima, meeting!

278
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,800
It is only meeting, right? Nothing 
urgent, isn't it?

279
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,040
Please, let me talk!

280
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,840
You know, Ima.

281
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,560
Size does matter in business.

282
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,360
- Shuck! 
- Like her.

283
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,080
You concentrate here.

284
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,920
Larger than life size.

285
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,200
On seeing in silver screen,

286
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,720
people will become a fan.

287
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,680
We start making scores. 
That is the psychology.

288
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,440
An ad of Rent and read.

289
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,600
If it comes on carnival screen,

290
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,840
from next day onwards there 
will be a queue here.

291
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,080
Like in the beverage.

292
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,880
Ofcourse! Book is like 
brandy bottle, isn't it?

293
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
What is your name?

294
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,200
- Shaileja. 
- But there is no shyness.

295
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,480
Allow me to talk. Please!

296
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,440
Ima, if our product 
should reach more people

297
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,280
we must reach to the people. 
Do you understand?

298
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,880
My dear!

299
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,520
- That I liked. 
- No, Vive...

300
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,480
Call like that. Good usage.

301
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,720
I didn't start this by targeting 
everyone like soap and comb.

302
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Main aim was to promote reading.

303
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,800
It was not aimed at profit.

304
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,720
That's good.

305
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,720
People here are looking at whatsapp 
even during the climax.

306
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,240
In between that advertisement.

307
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,680
Cheapness, spoiler and bluff!

308
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,040
Such an efficient girl

309
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,360
I haven't seen in my recent times.

310
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,360
Thanks!

311
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,040
Ima!

312
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,800
If the content is catchy,

313
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,640
nobody will look at the phone.

314
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,640
Ima please!

315
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,240
If you give me 24 hours time,

316
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,880
I'll return with an eye catchy campaign.

317
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,400
You can select only if you like.

318
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,080
Is it needed?

319
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,040
It is needed. Please!

320
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,240
It'll be very costly, isn't it?

321
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,400
You are mistaken.

322
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,800
In minimal cost

323
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,440
you'll get maximum reach.

324
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:35,120
The advertisement in big screen 
is that.

325
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:37,280
Anyway, we can negotiate on tariff 
and all.

326
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,040
Okay.

327
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,640
Send me a proposal first.

328
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,200
All of you have reached 
at the right time.

329
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,520
There is no delay.

330
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,160
Did all of you have food?

331
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,640
Do you know how to prepare raw 
banana fry?

332
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,880
No, boss!

333
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,720
I see. What about you?

334
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,280
Let me see.

335
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,920
Good. Do one thing.

336
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,160
You go to Marine Drive and sell that 
by standing under a tree.

337
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
If there is no other alternate, 
I'll also come to eat.

338
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,720
Why are you all going around calling 
yourself as salesmen? Donkeys!

339
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,280
If you sell two products, you 
bring back four.

340
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,400
To store that I have 
to get another godown.

341
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,040
There are many branded water filters 
in the market.

342
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,720
Then who'll buy our useless product?

343
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,400
What is wrong with our brand?

344
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,600
Nothing wrong.

345
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,920
Can't you see what is written 
in block letters?

346
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,960
Which other brand has got 
syngola 6 technology?

347
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,360
- Who is that? 
- What is syngola 6?

348
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,320
Yes.

349
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,840
I have told so many times.

350
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,120
In an ordinary water purifier

351
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,160
the bacteria are killed

352
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,400
and the dead bodies are 
deposited in that itself.

353
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,800
That is it. That will enter people's 
stomach and develop diarrhea.

354
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,640
But our water purifier

355
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,120
will kill the bacteria and see here,

356
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,200
it'll bury them in this cemetery cabin.

357
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,440
- Why are you laughing? 
- Nothing.

358
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,960
Is cemetery such a big comedy?

359
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,480
What is this?

360
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,640
Saying all this you try to sell 
this to the people.

361
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,200
Instead of that don't bring it 
back to me.

362
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,400
We'll do it.

363
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,880
I should be blamed to be 
supporting them. Let us go.

364
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,120
Seeing your face it looks like you 
have buried some syngola 6 in cemetery.

365
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,920
Out of depression I am starving.

366
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,480
Is it?

367
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,360
Today isn't it your turn to 
prepare food?

368
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,960
I'll prepare and you'll eat.

369
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,200
- You keep waiting. 
- I know that.

370
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,720
Let us go to the road side shop.

371
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,440
Ponni had called.

372
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,880
For porridge there is no rice.

373
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,120
- What is that? 
- To buy that and come. Rice.

374
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,800
What a tragedy! How many times 
did you watch 'ThenmavinKombathu'?

375
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,640
You start the vehicle.

376
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,640
- Okay. 
- Save Edaprayar!

377
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,160
Stop contamination of water!

378
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,040
Sigma Gelatin must be shut down!

379
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,560
Allow to live!

380
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,200
I am dying of hunger.

381
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,360
Find some place.

382
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,720
You are saved.

383
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,840
Go man!

384
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,160
If this continues, piles will be 
announced as national disease.

385
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,960
Stop! Where are you going?

386
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,960
You don't eat chicken.

387
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,160
- Piles... 
- Stop it!

388
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,720
While talking about food you don't 
talk about wastage.

389
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,960
Use 'Hit'. 
You'll get intermediate relief.

390
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,440
- No use of that. 
- Brother!

391
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,120
Things are not good.

392
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,560
What happened?

393
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,480
There is no benefit from 
this water business.

394
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,840
Life is full of leakage, isn't it?

395
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,920
Yes man!

396
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,440
There is development 
only in the matter of age.

397
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,480
That is going on increasing.

398
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,280
Brother! Two plates of parota...

399
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,400
and one animal meat. 
- What is this? Brother, beef!

400
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,080
- Okay. 
- Isn't beef an animal?

401
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,600
My precious! You remain silent.

402
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,880
All these ideas when we are hungry.

403
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,560
We can only order thinking as beef.

404
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,600
How do we know whether it is 
dog, cat or bull?

405
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,440
On saying as animal meat, all 
this will be covered.

406
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,720
On ordering we can eat peacefully.

407
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,280
I became greedy.

408
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,360
Oh...

409
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,320
We don't think we can eat meat...

410
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
and parota for too long 
in this Eranakulam city.

411
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,720
Should we take parcel for our friends?

412
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,840
No need!

413
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,360
Their motive to prepare porridge 
by themselves

414
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,440
will get spoilt.

415
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,680
Then let us continue 
with our motivation.

416
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,560
Anicha!

417
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,680
- What? 
- You eat first.

418
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,760
- Are you not eating? 
- First you eat.

419
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,280
Are you testing?

420
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,800
Should I pray?

421
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Oh God!

422
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,680
What is your opinion about women 
going to Sabarimalai?

423
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,360
First let a girl enter in my life.

424
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,800
- You wait and see. 
- Then I'll think about it.

425
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,480
All the girls are dumping me.

426
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,520
"In Marine Drive under the tree love 
is blossoming..."

427
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,440
Let this remain here.

428
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,720
Don't put the brief to dry here. 
Put it upstairs.

429
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,160
Why? Isn't my brief a decent one?

430
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,480
A fan is rotating here.

431
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,160
I am also sharing the 
electricity bill for that.

432
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,720
This will remain only here.

433
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,120
Who has left this door open?

434
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,880
They must be the ones.

435
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,720
Who else?

436
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,680
Why is the association secretary 
so irritated about the bachelors?

437
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:01,320
I don't know.

438
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,640
Tell him that Abdul Kalam sir was 
a bachelor.

439
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,960
Don't these idiots know that?

440
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,560
Bacteria has arrived.

441
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,160
Bacteria is your original father. 
Not the one in the certificate.

442
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,960
Dear, have you prepared porridge?

443
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,520
What? Today is your turn, isn't it?

444
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,120
If you don't want to starve, 
go and prepare it.

445
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,760
Give way.

446
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,280
Even Dubai is not so hot.

447
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,080
- Right! 
- Oh God!

448
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,320
- Secrecy! 
- That is good.

449
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,560
It looks like inside the stomach

450
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,240
an evacuation problem is going on.

451
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,640
- Is it? 
- I think that animal meat has worked.

452
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,920
The curse of all the animals is 
inside your stomach.

453
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,760
- That is it. 
- It is a big curse.

454
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,200
I'll be back soon.

455
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,400
Don't forget to flush.

456
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,440
It is your usual act.

457
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,920
You know about my business.

458
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
I am very particular about water saving.

459
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,600
What is your condition there?

460
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,080
I am okay here.

461
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,760
What okay?

462
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,280
You are wondering around there.

463
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
Father, please! 
Trust me.

464
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,560
Do what you want. 
I want you to succeed.

465
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,440
- What about mother? 
- That was over.

466
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,200
I have left office only now. 
I'll call after reaching home.

467
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,560
No need. I'll call.

468
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,120
- Fine. 
- Okay.

469
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,360
- Was that father? 
- I am safe for one week.

470
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,560
Right.

471
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,320
Seeing your expression 
I understood that.

472
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,200
- Is it? 
- You can either leave or not.

473
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,480
I need not stay here.

474
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,520
Why don't you send me to 
Dubai by getting a visa for me?

475
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,040
Hey, I need charger.

476
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,320
Charger?

477
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,840
Do you know what is the biggest 
shortage in Kerala?

478
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,200
Shortage of charger.

479
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,760
Anicha!

480
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,360
Shall we give application to 
the Chief Minister?

481
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,680
You go and give.

482
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:50,960
This is the problem. 
I must not tell.

483
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,840
You knock the door and then open.

484
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,640
You can't be sure in what condition 
we'll be inside.

485
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,520
- Take it. 
- Go away man

486
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,760
Who is this party?

487
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,440
My new client.

488
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,880
My new girlfriend.

489
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,960
New girlfriend? 
You never had any old girl friend.

490
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,360
She is good. 
What is her name?

491
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,720
Ima. Ima Rajiv.

492
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,760
Ima is okay. 
See to it that she is not dumb.

493
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,800
Go man!

494
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,680
Enough! 
No need to pinch too much.

495
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,920
Get me also an appointment.

496
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,760
In your care off 
I'll deliver my singola there.

497
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,960
Should you deliver your singola there?

498
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,840
Then her books will fall in that 
and become wet.

499
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,640
Go man!

500
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,520
Don't do any help.

501
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,800
No. Here after I won't 
help you in life.

502
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,760
Ima...Ima Rajiv.

503
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,440
Be careful!

504
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,640
How is it?

505
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,440
Interesting. I like it.

506
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,080
Thank you! Tell me.

507
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,520
In total after seeing

508
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,440
how much percent like will I get?

509
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,720
75%.

510
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,480
Above that

511
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,640
if 25% more is added?

512
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,600
Like will become love.

513
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,640
I mean...on seeing the final out

514
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,120
you'll love that.

515
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,200
Oh...let's see.

516
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,680
Shall we proceed?

517
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,800
Sure.

518
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,280
Let me know when it is ready.

519
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,680
It is ready.

520
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,760
This is a special case for me.

521
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,400
- Is it? 
- Yeah.

522
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,320
Thank you!

523
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,920
Don't you go to market anymore?

524
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,960
After that incident

525
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,560
wherever I see fish, 
I think about you.

526
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,360
- Wherever I see fight, I think about you. 
- Is it?

527
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,640
Thank you!

528
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,920
Good match!

529
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,960
Excuse me!

530
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,560
- Is Lumbar Grass's dog year there? 
- How does he know all this?

531
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,360
- Oh no! 
- Ima!

532
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,280
Malayalam translation of that is there.

533
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,160
'Dog's years'. Is that enough?

534
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,840
I am not much comfortable 
in Malayalam.

535
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,920
Why? Don't you know the alphabets?

536
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,720
May I know your good name?

537
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,840
Sorry! I have a very bad name.

538
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,720
Is it? Very good. 
Keep it up.

539
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,680
Idiot!

540
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,760
Good girl, but her name is tarnished.

541
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,840
Else it would have been interesting.

542
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,960
- What is this? 
- Sorry!

543
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,800
Anicha! Come...come.

544
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,880
Don't you want to talk business?

545
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,920
- Coming. 
- Come.

546
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,360
I am always ready.

547
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,560
Poor guy!

548
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,360
Give him 5 minutes.

549
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,880
He is my roommate.

550
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:37,680
You people are very 
fond of this 5 minutes.

551
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,560
Isn't it, Ani uncle?

552
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,840
Not Ani uncle. Anichan.

553
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,840
People fond of him does call like that.

554
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,440
Some bloody beggars

555
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,880
say so out of jealousy. 
Don't take it seriously.

556
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,160
Enough. Come to business.

557
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,120
- Let us come to the matter. 
- Yeah!

558
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,040
- That is... 
- Hey!

559
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,080
Sorry! I made a mistake.

560
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,200
- That is... 
- Wait.

561
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,520
- This is our brochure. 
- Oh.

562
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,920
I need not explain the matter to you.

563
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,920
Like that

564
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,640
I don't have to explain about our 
product to anyone.

565
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,080
Even then I am saying,

566
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,760
ours is the No. 1 water purifier 
in India.

567
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,120
Aquastil Now with Syngola 6 technology.

568
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Oh...there is no problem with 
the water here.

569
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,640
There won't be any problem 
on seeing.

570
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,760
I'll show you something.

571
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,800
Bad girl!

572
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,520
Get me two glasses of water.

573
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,520
Is the water also bad here like 
the name?

574
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,440
Go and get it. 
What is this?

575
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,800
She is not active.

576
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
Anicha, will you incur shock?

577
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,840
This is not as we think. 
We must be careful.

578
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,040
We must perform carefully.

579
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:36,920
Here, see.

580
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,480
It is enough 
if there is reaction in water.

581
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,280
No need for anything more.

582
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,160
See, look at the water.

583
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,120
There are rare chemicals and bacteria.

584
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,280
What is the matter?

585
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:54,200
It is because there is no knowledge 
about syngola 6 technology.

586
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,000
If it is our purifier,

587
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,640
all this will be

588
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,960
buried in a cemetery cabin.

589
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,040
Will there be rituals after the burial?

590
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,080
Oh God!

591
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,760
There are locks in your dress.

592
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,280
You lock your mouth with one 
from that.

593
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
I am explaining a matter.

594
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,920
Whatever it is,

595
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,120
we don't want this now.

596
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,600
- That... 
- Don't waste your time here.

597
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,120
Correct.

598
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,120
- Okay? 
- Yes.

599
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,080
It is better not to die of typhoid.

600
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,520
It is good to buy one.

601
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,200
No use of buying after getting diarrhea.

602
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,480
Let us go. What are you watching? 
Are you not coming?

603
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,880
- Let us go. Ima, I'll be back. 
- Bye!

604
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,440
- No need to give hand. 
- Shaileja, move aside.

605
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,320
No use of staying in the middle of books. 
You should have sense.

606
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,440
Come let us go.

607
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,960
She knows nothing about purifying.

608
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,720
She must study chemistry.

609
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,600
- Come. 
- Hey!

610
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,120
She is not right.

611
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,720
She is arrogant.

612
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,520
- Don't have any dealings with her. 
- Is it?

613
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,920
- I don't like her. 
- She is not meant for

614
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,080
cheap guys like you. 
Okay?

615
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,440
You shake hands with her carefully.

616
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,320
It is the time of 'Me too'.

617
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,000
For just touching the hand

618
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,800
you may have to hold her feet 
during bad time.

619
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,520
Will you feel bad 
if I tell you one thing?

620
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,840
- What is it? 
- What a tragedy!

621
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,000
If you call me to this dirty place 
again...

622
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,000
Come on.

623
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,280
- Hop in. 
- That is what I am also saying.

624
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,280
I must be blamed.

625
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,320
This not enough to blame 
you for this alone.

626
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,480
I should be beaten for bringing 
you here.

627
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,600
Start the vehicle.

628
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,800
- Stop! Stop! 
- What is it?

629
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,200
- What are you doing? 
- Stop there.

630
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,960
- Stop! 
- It is not me.

631
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,280
Donkey, stop!

632
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,000
How are you connected with him?

633
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,840
I am his roommate. 
What is the problem?

634
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,440
Roommate?

635
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,200
Then it is enough if I catch you.

636
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,680
He cheated me by 
talking about syngola...

637
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,960
and delivered a water filter at home.

638
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,560
It had leakage and the house got filled 
with water like MullaPeriyar dam.

639
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,560
I abused him and he took it back.

640
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,520
On asking for money he keeps cheating 
me by saying as tomorrow.

641
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,520
Tell him that I'll put an end to 
his tomorrow.

642
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:48,480
You don't worry.

643
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,160
I'll get the thing from him.

644
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,160
What if you are also a fraud like him?

645
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,160
Can't you see that I am not like that?

646
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,560
Many say like that.

647
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,760
But I am not like that.

648
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,880
In a peculiar circumstance I had to 
keep him with me. That's all.

649
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,760
How...

650
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,680
did you know that he is in this area?

651
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:07,200
I was searching for another thing.

652
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:10,640
There is 'Rent and read' library here. 
Do you know?

653
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,760
Do you want to go there?

654
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,640
- Yes. 
- I know the place. I'll drop you there.

655
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,640
That will be an inconvenience for you.

656
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,960
No problem. 
You hop in.

657
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,520
Then it is okay.

658
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,240
Ima, one minute.

659
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:22,600
- What is it? 
- Sir.

660
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,000
Haven't you left?

661
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,040
I left. 
But I returned.

662
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,400
This is Menon sir.

663
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,440
Profitable case.

664
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,480
Menon sir is special.

665
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,760
He is ultimate intellectual.

666
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,720
Full time book reading.

667
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,240
He needs book while going 
to bathroom also.

668
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,560
I'll introduce him to you.

669
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,840
Sir, this is Ima.

670
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,640
She is the all in all here.

671
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,440
- Nice to meet you. 
- Thank you!

672
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,200
I read your article in the newspaper.

673
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,160
Girls should be like this.

674
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,760
- Smart girl! 
- Thank you sir!

675
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,960
In actual

676
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,200
I feel a great respect for you.

677
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,960
His arrival is not a waste.

678
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,080
Thinking about the idiots 
who doesn't have the habit of reading

679
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,480
I feel very sad.

680
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,760
Yes, that is correct.

681
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,920
- Do you have reading habit? 
- Ofcourse!

682
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,200
What a question is that?

683
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,000
Instead of facebook

684
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,920
have you read any other book? 
Tell me.

685
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,160
Cursing your dad?

686
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,840
Suddenly if you ask 
how can I say?

687
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,480
Who is your favorite writer?

688
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,520
Is it the waiter in the bar?

689
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,800
What kind of question is this?

690
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,360
- Not that. 
- Then?

691
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,360
Shivashanker Pillai.

692
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,600
- Who? 
- Shivashanker Pillai.

693
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,480
Is your mind filled with rope?

694
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,400
A bit.

695
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,480
I need a membership now itself.

696
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,280
I'll tell madam.

697
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,440
What is the formality for that?

698
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,360
- You come. I'll tell you. 
- Yes.

699
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,440
God of politics.

700
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,120
Have you not left?

701
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,960
No. I thought I'll inform and go.

702
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,840
- Then you tell. 
- Shall I?

703
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,320
- You tell. 
- I'll go and return.

704
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,840
Will this old man be a nuisance?

705
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,520
He is maximum fond of rope.

706
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
You must be careful with the guy

707
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,400
wandering around with noose.

708
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,440
Is it good?

709
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,720
Is there only this nod?

710
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,640
Any comments?

711
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,400
I don't know what I should tell.

712
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,320
I am running short of words.

713
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,320
Right.

714
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,120
It is only when they abuse men

715
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,080
that women have no shortage 
for words.

716
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,000
Otherwise there is lot of shortage, 
isn't it?

717
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Go man!

718
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,880
She is sure to take me with her.

719
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,480
You are a different type off a person.

720
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,760
That I had felt long back.

721
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,200
You are bound to feel.

722
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,120
To think and live like all others.

723
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,440
it is possible for anyone.

724
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,040
Yes, including you.

725
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,640
You made fun of me, right?

726
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,840
Yeah!

727
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,120
I was serious.

728
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,600
You are really different.

729
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,600
I became your fan long back.

730
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,360
You know how to flatter very well.

731
00:34:58,920 --> 00:34:59,800
I mean it.

732
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,160
But this is the first time 
a person is accepting it.

733
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
I also want to become different.

734
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,960
What should I do?

735
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,040
If you read well,

736
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,240
you'll get knowledge and sense.

737
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,160
In the past I used to 
read well.

738
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,080
- Is it? 
- If I am right,

739
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,880
last time I read

740
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,200
'Love on the way'.

741
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,880
Great!

742
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,000
My Vive!

743
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,360
There are many types of reading.

744
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Have you heard what 
Kunjunni sir has said?

745
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,160
Reading will cultivate.

746
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,840
If you don't read, you'll bend.

747
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,920
It is said just like that.

748
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,720
In the past for many 
days I didn't read.

749
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,360
Even then nobody got attracted to me.

750
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,520
I swear!

751
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,200
Then okay. I'll leave.

752
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,240
- Did I make you hate? 
- Yes.

753
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,760
- Then okay. 
- Fine.

754
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,680
I'll get her.

755
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,080
- Vive! 
- Yes, sir.

756
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,160
- The sales is on Friday in Mumbai. 
- Okay.

757
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,000
This time you must go.

758
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,560
You are sending me because 
you can't take the abuse any more.

759
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,880
Rest I must hear, isn't it?

760
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,800
- I heard your mind voice. 
- No, sir.

761
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,080
Not that.

762
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,160
I am saying this for you 
to get a boost.

763
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,120
Yeah...yeah!

764
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,200
You go and celebrate.

765
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,640
Have two pegs.

766
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,400
You go around and come back fresh.

767
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,080
Yeah!

768
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,760
I can learn atleast two abusive 
words in Marathi, isn't it?

769
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,240
Hey!

770
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,920
Thaleserry property's two hard copies 
are there in the station.

771
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,920
Okay.

772
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,280
On the way you collect it.

773
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,080
- Hand over it to Mayur in the office. 
- Okay, sir.

774
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,640
- I'll call and inform. 
- Okay.

775
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,040
Excuse me, sir. 
It is the client.

776
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,040
- Carry on. 
- Thank you!

777
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,080
- Hello! 
- Hi!

778
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,640
You can come and collect that cheque.

779
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,480
Our first ever financial day. 
Take it.

780
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:55,720
- Will it bounce? 
- No.

781
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,000
Thank you!

782
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,320
The signature is excellent.

783
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,520
Yeah!

784
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,280
It looks like a lorry has had 
an accident.

785
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Joke!

786
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,440
How is your advertisement business 
going on?

787
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,680
Not bad. 
Very good improvement.

788
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,120
In the matter of the 
cash that is due.

789
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,360
Somewhere here a love wholesale 
is going on.

790
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,520
Let everybody love. 
How are you bothered?

791
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,000
Isn't this useless into any love?

792
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,240
Are you not ashamed to call me like tha?

793
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,040
To feel ashamed is 'Useless' a bad name?

794
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,080
Shall I tell a truth?

795
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,560
Nobody has loved me till now.

796
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,440
In that matter you can trust me.

797
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,520
I am a virgin.

798
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,560
I'll believe you.

799
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,680
How am I bothered if you are 
into love?

800
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,360
Not that...

801
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,160
What about you?

802
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,440
To me?

803
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,680
- Love? 
- Uhm...

804
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,720
No way!

805
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,160
I like to live freely like this

806
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,560
without any commitments and control.

807
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,240
I also like to live without

808
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
any commitments and control.

809
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,720
- But... 
- But?

810
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,840
On seeing some girls,

811
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,240
I lose my control.

812
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,120
What to do?

813
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,200
"Seeing a flower bud passing by..."

814
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,920
"There are some dreams in my heart."

815
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,960
"In the song that can 
be heard in the air..."

816
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,840
"Two parrots are coming together 
in a nest."

817
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,680
"Let us do some sweet talks and 
laugh together."

818
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,880
"Slowly petal will bloom."

819
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,840
"Is it a rose flower?"

820
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,160
"This love will develop in us."

821
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,480
"Regularly it can be heard."

822
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,440
"Are they the spring music?"

823
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,640
"Unknowingly your love will melt."

824
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,480
"Closely in the soul..."

825
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,200
"Thousands of sweet wishes will rise."

826
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,920
"It is such a pleasure!"

827
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
"Sweet words will flow."

828
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:20,000
"It'll spread happiness."

829
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:26,120
"Two souls are bringing together 
desirable music."

830
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,960
"Slowly petal will bloom."

831
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,920
"Is it a rose flower?"

832
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,120
"This love will develop in us."

833
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,840
"Emotions will get soaked in the eyes."

834
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,320
"Sweet talk will sprinkle as smile."

835
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,320
"We'll wander on the same path."

836
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,440
"Each and every word will be heard 
with attention."

837
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,520
"Each minutes will pass 
by in this stage."

838
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,240
"We'll get united on a spot 
in the heart."

839
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:52,040
"On the path where flowers bloom, 
we'll fly as butterflies."

840
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:57,720
"The heart will search 
for eternal love."

841
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,240
"Slowly petal will bloom."

842
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:04,080
"Is it a rose flower?"

843
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:09,320
"This love will develop in us."

844
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,520
"Every day a new feeling will 
rise in us."

845
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,560
"That love will grow by itself."

846
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:53,080
"Each and every moment 
will be cherished."

847
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:58,200
"It'll awake memories in you."

848
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:04,000
"Sunrise will spread unique 
golden rays all over."

849
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,560
"Sunset will give way to rainbow."

850
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,600
"Let us enjoy this phase and flow 
as a song."

851
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,480
"The heart will be 
filled with that song."

852
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,680
"Slowly petal will bloom."

853
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,520
"Is it a rose flower?"

854
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,720
"This love will develop in us."

855
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,080
"Regularly it can be heard."

856
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,200
"Are they the spring music?"

857
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,200
"Unknowingly your love will melt."

858
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,320
You hug me and sit.

859
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,840
Fat hopes

860
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,920
Now you get down.

861
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,440
What is the work in Mumbai?

862
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,240
- Other than boozing. 
- That?

863
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:59,240
It is a problem job given 
to me by my boss.

864
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,240
You are a big problem by yourself.

865
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,400
How can he get you into trouble?

866
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,680
Try to make some growth on the way.

867
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,160
Let me tell you one thing.

868
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,880
I don't like the girls 
who give me advice.

869
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,960
- Tea...tea... 
- Let us sit here.

870
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,880
Tea!

871
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:15,080
If I ask you a serious thing, 
will you take it as a joke?

872
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,520
We Malayilis find comedy even 
in tragedy.

873
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,040
That...

874
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,760
If you plan to propose, no need.

875
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,640
How smart!

876
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,200
How did you know that I planned 
to propose?

877
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,840
I also eat the same rice that you eat.

878
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,040
From where does this 
rocking counter come?

879
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,840
It is only this much to see.

880
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,720
But you can talk a lot.

881
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,640
Girls who can talk cutely like this

882
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,360
has got a name in our native.

883
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,440
- Shall I tell you? 
- If it is something bad, no need.

884
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,560
It is not bad. 
It is very good.

885
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,280
- Shall I tell? 
- Okay you tell.

886
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,640
Naughty girl!

887
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,080
You beggar! I'll kill you.

888
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,840
What a tragedy! 
Don't make me say anything more.

889
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,680
Okay.

890
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,960
Allow me to tell.

891
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,480
No need to tell anything.

892
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
Call me.

893
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,520
- Will you phone me? 
- Yeah!

894
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,840
What is this?

895
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,560
Cholera time love!

896
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:06,200
You said you wanted to be different 
and you are bored.

897
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,840
You can read when you are bored.

898
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,960
Let me see.

899
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,560
Finally will this cholera make a hit?

900
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:12,000
You read it.

901
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,200
Sir.

902
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,080
- Does Harish have moustache? 
- Harish's moustache?

903
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,400
Let it remain in his face.

904
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,400
Else tell him to shave it off.

905
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,360
You are a book reader. 
Take it.

906
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,240
Bro, no use.

907
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,120
Don't try to provoke.

908
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,720
This is online library.

909
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,760
What is there if it is offline?

910
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,200
We'll make it online. Okay?

911
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,280
From where has he landed?

912
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,440
- Call me. 
- Okay.

913
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:34,920
- I'll phone you. Bye. 
- Bye!

914
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,720
Mobile!

915
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,360
Vive's excellent catch!

916
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,960
Your mobile...

917
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,360
- Yes. 
- Okay.

918
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,880
- Have you booked vehicle? 
- It'll reach the station.

919
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:58,640
Client will surely send.

920
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,280
Let us go and see.

921
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,880
We must never help a Malayali.

922
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,080
Look at her.

923
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,800
Arrogant! Is she sitting here?

924
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,040
Bro, move a bit.

925
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,520
Actually I expected a thanks.

926
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,240
What is the cost of the mobile

927
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,400
which I caught before it fell?

928
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,600
Why is she silent?

929
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,000
Will you vomit at night?

930
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,960
What happened?

931
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,160
- I just asked. 
- No problem.

932
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,480
Excuse me!

933
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:47,800
To where are you going?

934
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,240
She is not a mingling type.

935
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,080
This book is the only companion.

936
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,920
Shuck! What a boring!

937
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:18,880
Shuck!

938
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,600
My dear, what kind of a book have 
you given me?

939
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,320
Is it 'Cholera time love'?

940
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,280
Why couldn't you have given 
'Cold night'?

941
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,200
Else you could have 
given 'Wingless dreams'.

942
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,280
It is bad that you thought of me 
as of your standard.

943
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,040
Hello! She has disconnected.

944
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,920
On saying anything, she'll disconnect.

945
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,280
Cholera is also gone.

946
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,640
Now I have only this Sukra sir's book.

947
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,600
They have fitted this thing for the 
passengers to charge their mobile.

948
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,480
None of them are working.

949
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,200
These holes are made for the insects 
to build nest.

950
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,240
- What do you say? 
- Yes.

951
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,880
Will he be her father?

952
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,880
Excuse me! Don't mistake me for 
asking this.

953
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,000
Any problem?

954
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,760
I think she is the latest 
version of arrogance.

955
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,920
TTR is here.

956
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:41,640
How much is the cost?

957
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,240
- It is confirmed. 
- Is it so?

958
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,080
Tell him to recharge my phone.

959
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:50,440
I'll call and see.

960
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,280
Where is she going?

961
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,000
I didn't ask her anything now, right?

962
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,520
Bro, one second! Shall I sit there?

963
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:08,160
What is she telling him by 
going there?

964
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:12,720
Oh God!

965
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,680
Oh God! 
Move.

966
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,720
Tea...tea...

967
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,280
Tea... Bro, tea!

968
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,640
- Tea. 
- No need. It must be a bad tea.

969
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,840
This guy is not proper.

970
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:01,800
There is a small mistake.

971
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,960
- Oh God! 
- Oh no!

972
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,600
I didn't do anything.

973
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,240
I am innocent.

974
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:42,560
From the time he arrived he started.

975
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:44,200
He is trying to grab the girl.

976
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,760
Nerve patient! He should be handed 
over to the police.

977
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,520
It is not my mistake.

978
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,760
Oh God! I didn't do anything.

979
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,280
My dear! I am not an eve teaser.

980
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,760
I am an innocent guy. I am going to 
Mumbai for a meeting. You devil!

981
00:49:57,840 --> 00:49:59,920
Why are you beating me?

982
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,080
Oh God! Don't catch it in camera.

983
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,760
I have to go for the meeting.

984
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:13,240
Oh God! I am innocent!

985
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,760
Oh no, it's not me!

986
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,360
A lie that I told you about me,

987
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,160
will come to light now.

988
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,200
- Why are you resisting like this? 
- Sir..

989
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,080
Come with me.

990
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,880
I feel afraid.

991
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,360
Please sir! Please!

992
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,480
Go inside.

993
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,960
- Sir, please! 
- Oh...

994
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:54,800
Sir, please!

995
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,000
We'll find a solution for your hunger.

996
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,560
Sir, look at me as your brother.

997
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:58,800
Then do you want me to stink?

998
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,360
I have got a meeting.

999
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,360
Once sir arrives, we'll attend all 
the meeting.

1000
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:03,520
Is it by assaulting?

1001
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,560
Please, sir! Sir!

1002
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,320
Welcome!

1003
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:09,080
Come.

1004
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,760
Sit there.

1005
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,360
Sit.

1006
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,240
Is it molesting?

1007
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,040
What?

1008
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:23,560
What?

1009
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:29,240
Did you try to quench the thirst of 
a common Malayali's creation?

1010
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,080
Why did you do this unwanted thing?

1011
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,680
Now there will be case, prison, 
news and there will be night discussion.

1012
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,760
Your life is gone.

1013
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,680
I haven't molested anyone.

1014
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,240
Then what is the problem? 
You relax.

1015
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,680
They are not believing 
what I am saying.

1016
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:48,040
Do you believe in law?

1017
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,400
Believe in law.

1018
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,400
Who are you?

1019
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,120
I have dealings with God.

1020
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:01,960
My recordicall name is 'Hundi lover'.

1021
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,880
Now and then I'll loot the hundi 
in temples and churches.

1022
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,280
In that matter I am a man who 
believes in all religions.

1023
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,640
From that money I give some to

1024
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:11,840
vegetable vendors,

1025
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,800
tea shop owners

1026
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,360
and fish sellers.

1027
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:19,120
Rest I give in beverages and 
support our government.

1028
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,640
Like in the past, there is not much 
money in the hundis

1029
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,840
Some people preach this and that

1030
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,080
and change the mind of 
the devotees.

1031
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,240
So, you are a thief, isn't it?

1032
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,920
Some people do call like that. 
What a fate!

1033
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,920
There are people here 
to invest in millions

1034
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,320
and produce cinema about 
'KayamkulamKochunni'.

1035
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,160
Nobody wants our bio pic.

1036
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,200
Society is biased.

1037
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,160
In this condition also 
you are able to smile.

1038
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,080
That is a positive sign.

1039
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:54,480
If you talk about your life 
filled with incidents,

1040
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,000
there won't be any particular use.

1041
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,640
But I'll hear.

1042
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,080
Just for a mercury. 
Just like that.

1043
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,680
Is it going to start from an 
ordinary family

1044
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:07,440
in an hill station?

1045
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:11,040
- Sir, I am astrologer Manipayari. 
- Aah!

1046
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,960
It must be because he is educated.

1047
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,680
You sit.

1048
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,280
What happened? Tell me.

1049
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,240
What is this? 
She is not saying anything.

1050
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,080
No use if you remain silent.

1051
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,080
Railway police completed with 
their procedure.

1052
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,120
Now it is our job.

1053
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,040
A police station has got 
its own formalities.

1054
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,400
You ask her in detail.

1055
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,320
This is not a place to fun.

1056
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,720
It is police station. You tell quickly. 
We have to file an FIR.

1057
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:44,720
We didn't tell you to cry.

1058
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,120
We told you to tell.

1059
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,720
Say something.

1060
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,320
Can't you talk?

1061
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,760
- Can you hear? 
- Hmm.

1062
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,600
Did he molest you?

1063
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,880
Then what happened?

1064
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,840
How can we know in detail?

1065
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,200
- Hey, you find a solution. 
- Sir.

1066
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,360
Otherwise also there is no 
value to the words of men.

1067
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,320
Correct.

1068
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,160
Why do men alone are able to cry?

1069
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,120
It is due to unemployment.

1070
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,920
Do you have anyone to get 
you out in bail?

1071
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,640
This is that.

1072
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:21,600
We realize that only 
we are there for our self

1073
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,480
during bad times.

1074
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:28,600
In the past there was a professor 
with me in prison who told a thing.

1075
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,560
When you are in trouble 
people treat you as trouble.

1076
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:36,000
Yeah! Let me see if I can 
do anything.

1077
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:38,360
Hold me. 
I have to get up.

1078
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,440
Brother, ask him.

1079
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,920
Sir! Sir!

1080
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:45,800
- What is it? 
- Please come here

1081
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,760
What happened in the matter 
of this boy?

1082
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:50,720
You listen to what he has to say.

1083
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,520
That girl is dumb.

1084
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,520
We are unable to understand 
what she is saying.

1085
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,720
Dumb? Oh God!

1086
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,840
It is gone.

1087
00:54:57,880 --> 00:54:59,640
Now what will you do?

1088
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,720
Let someone who knows 
sign language come.

1089
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:02,720
Then we'll see.

1090
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,120
There is a person.

1091
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,200
Someone known. 
Shall I call?

1092
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,160
- Hi! 
- Bye

1093
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,600
Banerjee has arrived.

1094
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,160
He is the one I told you about.

1095
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,760
He is great.

1096
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,840
Including sign language, he knows 
6 languages.

1097
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,000
Gold smuggling is his 
main business.

1098
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,720
In leisure time he goes to prison.

1099
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:27,120
Bannerjee... is he a Bengali?

1100
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,200
No, Malayali.

1101
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,400
His father was crazy about football.

1102
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,880
Isn't our P.K.Banerjee there?

1103
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,200
A fan of his.

1104
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,360
That is why he named him with 
that name.

1105
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:37,840
It'll be okay, isn't it?

1106
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:39,680
Ofcourse, it'll be fine now.

1107
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,880
Aah.

1108
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,640
The issue is that she is dumb.

1109
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,400
- Else I would have got saved. 
- You remain silent.

1110
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,240
Sir, she is saying

1111
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,600
that he didn't do anything.

1112
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,320
The passengers intervened and 
spoilt the matter.

1113
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,760
She couldn't tell the truth.

1114
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:10,120
This is a real problem.

1115
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:12,520
- Hey, release that boy. 
- Sir.

1116
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,480
My work is over, isn't it? 
Shall I leave?

1117
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,560
You come.

1118
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:20,880
- Is it to beat? 
- Come.

1119
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,960
Come on

1120
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,640
Don't be afraid. 
You come here.

1121
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,280
No need to lock. 
Where will I go?

1122
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,160
No, I'll lock and give the key to you.

1123
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:34,240
Leave it.

1124
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,160
Have you ever thought 
about we policemen?

1125
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,560
By remaining awake and staying 
away from relatives

1126
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,600
we are running around to maintain peace 
in the country.

1127
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:43,360
We also make some mistakes.

1128
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:44,760
We are also humans.

1129
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,800
- You are going to Mumbai, isn't it? 
- Yeah.

1130
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,520
You drop her also in railway station.

1131
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:50,920
You are going to mangalapuram, 
isn't it?

1132
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,800
You go to the railway station 
with him.

1133
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,440
Are you happy? You go.

1134
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,600
For a stranger like me

1135
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:05,880
you did so much.

1136
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:09,080
I'll never forget this.

1137
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,280
This is nothing.

1138
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,280
I'll also never forget.

1139
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,880
For thieves like us, to remember

1140
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,360
only some moments like this are there.

1141
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,280
You are something special.

1142
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,640
I'll never forget.

1143
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,880
All the best!

1144
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,760
I forgot to ask you one thing.

1145
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:37,960
What is your real name?

1146
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:41,320
For people who don't 
have anyone to remember,

1147
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,200
what is the need for a name?

1148
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,280
You can call as anything.

1149
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,240
Call as Ramakrishnan.

1150
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,200
That is my father's name.

1151
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,280
What is that?

1152
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,120
'I couldn't do anything in train'

1153
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,680
'At that time. Sorry!'

1154
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:23,000
After getting me all the beating 
are you saying sorry?

1155
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,240
What is your name?

1156
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,520
'Deepika!'

1157
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,840
Deepika. You have put off the light 
in my life. You sinner!

1158
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:45,160
'Please don't be angry on me, please'

1159
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,400
I am not angry.

1160
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:51,000
I have got only gratitude towards you.

1161
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:54,080
I could see the interior of the lock 
up due to you.

1162
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,400
I came to know all the matters.

1163
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,400
I saw. Congrats!

1164
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,000
Ima, what happened was...

1165
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,080
No need. 
You need not say anything.

1166
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,920
I know what you are going to say.

1167
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,360
For the time being I have no 
mood to talk to you.

1168
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,600
Bye!

1169
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:16,080
Hello! Hello!

1170
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,120
That is also gone.

1171
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,640
Don't look at me like this.

1172
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,280
Hey, are you hungry?

1173
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,680
Come.

1174
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,360
Have you seen him?

1175
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:42,240
He should be beaten like this.

1176
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,760
If only I had got him in my hand,

1177
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:45,480
I would have killed this dog.

1178
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:48,480
He is just an idiot to have tried 
to molest a girl in front of the people.

1179
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,000
People reacted correctly.

1180
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,480
I'll be back soon.

1181
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,520
This is 'Twenty four'.

1182
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:04,920
'The daughter of Mr. Srikanth,'

1183
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,240
'the MD of the Sigma company, 
which is in Edaprayar was kidnapped.'

1184
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,560
'The kidnappers were arrested by 
the police after a confrontation.'

1185
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,120
'The activist party leader AnbuShabeer, 
who planned this kidnap...'

1186
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,680
'Was shot and dead during the incident.'

1187
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,640
'Police informed that the girl,'

1188
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:18,800
'Was handed over to the parents safely.'

1189
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,840
'Activists testified that the kidnap happened..'

1190
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,760
'..as all their alternative measures failed'

1191
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,520
'The activists who were 
caught confronted.'

1192
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,960
'Anwar Jamal devoted his 
life for the fight against'

1193
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,040
'the Sigma company in Edaprayar.'

1194
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,040
'His death has shocked the whole 
of Kerala.'

1195
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:38,520
Mobile!

1196
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:43,240
I am happy!

1197
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,800
Rice, kerosene, sugar.

1198
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:50,720
I have lost my job.

1199
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,440
I need not go to Mumbai.

1200
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,520
Her sign language.

1201
01:00:57,600 --> 01:00:59,280
You beat me on my chest 
by folding that hand.

1202
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:01,240
That will be better.

1203
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,480
Where will I go now, my God!

1204
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,200
I can't return to my native.

1205
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:10,280
There I am a viral hero due to you.

1206
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,040
Everybody kicked and stamped 
me on online.

1207
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,960
No use of returning to the native.

1208
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,400
I am not left with any job.

1209
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:19,480
What work do you have in Mangalore?

1210
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,160
Why are you crying, Deepika?

1211
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,920
You write and show something.

1212
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:39,120
Tomorrow is the marriage. 
Then why are you here?

1213
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:46,640
Oh God!

1214
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,760
Stop the bus!

1215
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:50,320
Stop the bus!

1216
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:51,720
Please stop the bus.

1217
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:53,440
Stop the vehicle!

1218
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:55,520
Get in.

1219
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,200
Let us go.

1220
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,960
Hello! Are you eloping?

1221
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,160
Are you thinking how I know?

1222
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:10,000
In the past I have 
also eloped like this.

1223
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:15,600
'I got into the bus, 
on the way to railway station'

1224
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,760
'Don't be tensed. 
You come.'

1225
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,960
'Where have you reached?'

1226
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,360
'I'll be in Kottayam. 
Don't be afraid.'

1227
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,880
No use of remaining like this.

1228
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,360
Let us see what we can do.

1229
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:37,720
What is there to do?

1230
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,480
What were you doing here?

1231
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,840
I told you to take care hundred times.

1232
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,800
If she doesn't want any of us, 
let her go.

1233
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,840
By cheating everyone she has 
left with a useless guy.

1234
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,040
Till where will she go?

1235
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,560
Till now she hasn't opened 
the door.

1236
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,480
Anju! Anju!

1237
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:58,760
What is it?

1238
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,120
Open the door.

1239
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,800
No use of your remaining behind 
locked door.

1240
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:06,760
I won't open. You want to 
beat me, isn't it?

1241
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,360
We won't do anything.

1242
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,480
You open the door.

1243
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,920
Don't I know uncle?

1244
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,320
Dear, this is not a small matter.

1245
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,960
The matter is not as you are thinking.

1246
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,240
Will you open or should I break it?

1247
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:24,600
She left with the 
man of her choice.

1248
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:26,360
What is the use of breaking this door?

1249
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,960
Anju dear, open the door!

1250
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:36,840
Why are you also not trying to 
understand her feelings?

1251
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,480
No use of beating me.

1252
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,640
She has gone to live with the man 
of her choice.

1253
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:42,200
Tell us where she has gone.

1254
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,120
Why are you pleading to her? 
I'll make her talk.

1255
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:45,240
To Mangalapuram.

1256
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,680
Are you telling the truth?

1257
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:48,960
Yeah!

1258
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,120
How did they go?

1259
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,160
- That I don't know. 
- Is it by train?

1260
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,040
You didn't show this eagerness in 
understanding her mind.

1261
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,480
Hey!

1262
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,920
From the time that she has left, it is 
more probable that she has gone by train.

1263
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,880
In Mangalapuram Raghu 
and friends are there.

1264
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,560
I'll call and tell them.

1265
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:10,920
He'll bring her back from 
the railway station.

1266
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:15,280
- The auspicious time might pass away. 
- That is okay.

1267
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,200
Where did he go?

1268
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,760
I think he has cheated you.

1269
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:31,920
He must have thought that 
it'll be a loss

1270
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,400
to marry you.

1271
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:37,520
Whatever it is, he could have 
called you.

1272
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,320
The phone is switched off.

1273
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:40,840
Where to go and search for him?

1274
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,760
Hello! Deepika, where have you reached?

1275
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,200
Give the phone to Mahesh.

1276
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,920
It is to tell him an important matter. 
Give it to him.

1277
01:05:00,800 --> 01:05:01,680
Give it to me.

1278
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,120
Who is this?

1279
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:04,800
Hello!

1280
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:06,920
Mahesh, don't go to Mangalapuram.

1281
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,520
They have arranged men to catch 
you there.

1282
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,200
You get down somewhere else.

1283
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:12,840
Hello! Stop!

1284
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,560
I am not Mahesh. 
I am Vive.

1285
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,480
Vive?

1286
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:18,120
Where did he go?

1287
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:20,120
How do I know?

1288
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:21,560
What will I do?

1289
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:23,200
What will I do now?

1290
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,760
Please, you be with her.

1291
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:27,320
There is nobody else.

1292
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:28,840
She is a dumb girl.

1293
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,280
Protect her till Mahesh comes. 
Please!

1294
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:34,920
Who is that?

1295
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,920
My God!

1296
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:44,720
Hey, what are you going to do now?

1297
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,280
'I will wait until Mahesh calls'

1298
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:52,360
What if he doesn't come?

1299
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,000
'I will die'

1300
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,920
Suicide?

1301
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:06,080
If you commit suicide, I'll get trapped.

1302
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:08,360
People will make out that 
you committed suicide...

1303
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,440
by getting dejected 
due to molestation.

1304
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,520
I'll go to prison again.

1305
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:11,640
I won't allow you to die.

1306
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:12,920
You need not die like that.

1307
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,640
'I have no other way apart from that'

1308
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,320
What happened to my daughter?

1309
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:43,000
- Crane has come for us. Get in. 
- I am getting scared

1310
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,760
So much crowd!

1311
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,960
Go to that side.

1312
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:50,240
Like that. Careful!

1313
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:52,360
This is her first time. careful!

1314
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:55,640
No problem. 
Sir, let us go.

1315
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,240
- Let me talk to the people. 
- Come this way.

1316
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,960
Many will tell not to put 
money in hundi.

1317
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,880
Not only coins.

1318
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,200
- But also notes. 
- Stop talking.

1319
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:07,440
People like me also have to survive.

1320
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:08,920
Sir, don't file a case.

1321
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:11,520
The girl made a mistake. 
They are naive.

1322
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,600
Following the new law why 
to file a case? Drop it.

1323
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,880
For the time being I am not 
doing anything.

1324
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,400
Tell them to take care of that girl.

1325
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,480
Such people may repeat this.

1326
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,960
Thanks a lot!

1327
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,840
Okay, sir.

1328
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,000
Will I also get the consideration that 
you gave the girl? - Start the vehicle.

1329
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,440
Come, let us celebrate.

1330
01:07:29,480 --> 01:07:31,880
It is a long time since 
we came together.

1331
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:33,120
No need for any celebration.

1332
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:34,200
I have health issues.

1333
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,840
Do you have any palpitation?

1334
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,840
Forget that. 
Is there any snacks?

1335
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:06,800
Two copies of this.

1336
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,240
Was the thief, who jumped inside 
the well brought to this station?

1337
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,520
Just now he was taken 
to produce in the court.

1338
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,960
Let this remain here. I'll come 
back and take it.

1339
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,960
This new handcuff has no look.

1340
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,120
It looks like the bangle in the 
hands of the Sardarji.

1341
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:33,280
There should be a look 
when others see.

1342
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:35,720
The old one had star value.

1343
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,640
This is not gaining attention. 
So sad!

1344
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,400
Why is it like this now?

1345
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:43,680
Technology updation is needed 
here also.

1346
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:46,000
It is the time of 
artificial intelligence.

1347
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,680
- The old one had power. 
- Right.

1348
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:52,720
Where is the vehicle?

1349
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,520
The bus is here.

1350
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:55,920
Stop!

1351
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:01,080
Who is this? 
Have you reached here also?

1352
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,880
This is my girlfriend. 
My companion in the well.

1353
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,680
You come.

1354
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:08,520
Let us go.

1355
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,080
I am a guest of the state.

1356
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:12,600
I don't have to buy ticket.

1357
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,320
What is the news?

1358
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,680
Is the welcome of the residential 
association over?

1359
01:09:19,720 --> 01:09:21,560
Anyway, where are you going?

1360
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:23,440
Is it to the suicide point?

1361
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,400
I came to meet you.

1362
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:26,840
Is it?

1363
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:33,360
Is it your first visit to 
the court?

1364
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:34,480
Do you know?

1365
01:09:34,520 --> 01:09:39,480
Only the peons know correctly 
about the court procedures.

1366
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,600
Let us come to the point.

1367
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:43,280
Tell me. 
What is the matter?

1368
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,440
What is the motive behind 
coming to meet me?

1369
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:50,040
- What happened to that girl? 
- Which girl?

1370
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,600
The other girl, Deepika?

1371
01:09:53,640 --> 01:09:55,160
Did you come to hear the story?

1372
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,400
Curious girl!

1373
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:57,920
Please tell me!

1374
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:59,880
Where did we stop?

1375
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,680
- In the railway station they both... 
- Yeah!

1376
01:10:03,720 --> 01:10:05,520
Again the story continues.

1377
01:10:06,120 --> 01:10:09,200
At mid night in the premises 
of a railway station.

1378
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:10,800
Deepika,

1379
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:13,000
this suicide is not 
a solution for anything.

1380
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,080
In life there will 
be any difficult times.

1381
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,920
To cross that we'll get a solution also.

1382
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,520
Our brilliance lies in understanding 
and finding that solution.

1383
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:23,280
That is, Vivek's brilliance.

1384
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,920
Take this.

1385
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:28,040
'Will you help me find Mahes?'

1386
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:30,280
I got kicked very badly.

1387
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,680
We'll find it.

1388
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,560
I'll stand by you.

1389
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:39,520
But you don't commit suicide.

1390
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:40,800
Okay?

1391
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:42,120
You drink coffee.

1392
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,760
Be positive.

1393
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:47,600
You learn from me.

1394
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:50,040
I lost my job and honor.

1395
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,600
I lost the girl whom 
I had attracted.

1396
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:52,880
Still I am positive.

1397
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,480
Yeah!

1398
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,040
Are you hungry?

1399
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:00,640
I feel so hungry.

1400
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:02,880
That parota which I ate was 
not enough.

1401
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,640
Which is your favorite food?

1402
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,360
Do you have potato fry?

1403
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:13,360
No. I don't sell any 
unhealthy food here.

1404
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,760
'Rice and fish curry'

1405
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,480
Is it rice and fish? 
Same thing.

1406
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,000
Rice and small prawns 
are my favorite.

1407
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,720
Deepika, if you commit suicide, 
you won't be able to eat this.

1408
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:28,800
If you won't feel bad, shall I 
ask you one thing?

1409
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,720
Accepting this handicap of yours

1410
01:11:33,800 --> 01:11:36,200
Mahesh is in love with you.

1411
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:38,520
Why is your family opposing that?

1412
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:44,760
'Mahesh is from lower caste'

1413
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:49,440
Which caste?

1414
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,920
'The caste of love'

1415
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,640
That is not lower. 
It is upper.

1416
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,960
'I know it but my family 
doesn't know.'

1417
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:07,400
Yes, bloody people!

1418
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,640
They will conduct marriage 
seeing caste and wealth.

1419
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:11,680
There is no value for 
two people's love.

1420
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:24,120
Deepika...Yes!

1421
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,240
I forgot the name.

1422
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:30,720
- Mahesh. 
-V.Mahesh.

1423
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:31,880
Hi!

1424
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,760
Anju told me everything. 
Don't worry.

1425
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,200
I didn't introduce myself.

1426
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,120
This is my wife Neelima. 
Anju's friend.

1427
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,840
Now my wife. 
She is pregnant.

1428
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,720
I am Dr. Gautam. MBBS. 
Living in China.

1429
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,920
Did he jump the 
great wall and go?

1430
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,520
I can understand the 
meaning of this smile.

1431
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:50,880
Why do you tell about this 
China everywhere?

1432
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,640
Truth is like a pregnancy.

1433
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:54,000
It can't be hidden.

1434
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:55,840
Isn't it? 
- Was the journey comfortable?

1435
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:57,360
It was very comfortable.

1436
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:00,400
We can talk in detail after 
reaching home.

1437
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:01,600
Neeli, come on!

1438
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,440
Bro, one minute!

1439
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,600
No need to say anything.

1440
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:06,120
I can understand the situation.

1441
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,640
I am there with you.

1442
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:10,400
Anyway, congrats!

1443
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:11,840
- Thank you! 
- Smart!

1444
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,720
I like those who show 
adventure in love.

1445
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,000
We had a love marriage.

1446
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,720
Is it? 
- We didn't get a chance to elope.

1447
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,000
Before that our family gave 
its consent.

1448
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,480
Come.

1449
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,040
Have you come to 
Kozhikodu before this?

1450
01:13:25,680 --> 01:13:27,080
Yes, I have come.

1451
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,800
Isn't it a super place? 
- Yeah!

1452
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:30,880
Good culture.

1453
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,120
Excellent food.

1454
01:13:33,160 --> 01:13:34,760
Loving people!

1455
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:38,160
If someone from outside comes here, 
people will shower love on them.

1456
01:13:38,200 --> 01:13:39,400
That is true.

1457
01:13:39,960 --> 01:13:42,360
Have you been staying in Bangalore 
from a long time?

1458
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:43,520
Yes.

1459
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,120
Are you not in IT field? 
- Yeah!

1460
01:13:46,160 --> 01:13:48,080
We are from the same field.

1461
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,040
I am working in Oracle platform.

1462
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,600
What about you? Hey!

1463
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:54,840
I am talking to you.

1464
01:13:55,800 --> 01:13:57,520
- Java. 
- Java?

1465
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:01,600
Java is very simple, isn't it?

1466
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,280
Yeah!

1467
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:38,640
Mahesh, its a day man! 
Congrats!

1468
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,440
Guys, I don't want you to be 
workaholic.

1469
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:42,320
On working hard, there will be 
achievements.

1470
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:43,720
Mahesh has proved that.

1471
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,320
That is why we could come together 
in such an occasion.

1472
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:47,960
Everybody will get opportunities.

1473
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,760
Use it. Now you can celebrate.

1474
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,080
Yes!

1475
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:13,800
Boss.

1476
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,080
Thank you!

1477
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:17,840
Okay.

1478
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,360
The marriage is on the 10th. 
Don't forget.

1479
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,560
How can I remain without coming? 
I'll come for sure.

1480
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:41,240
If you don't come, you'll know.

1481
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:42,920
Hey, keep that scale inside.

1482
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,040
He is playing!

1483
01:15:44,080 --> 01:15:46,080
- His scale! 
- Bro, when will you be coming again?

1484
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:47,880
We'll meet. 
Okay?

1485
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,160
Kannada beauties of Mangalapuramwill 
have sleepless nights from here on.

1486
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,840
I am flattered. 
- Okay.

1487
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:54,520
- Run along. All the best! 
- Okay.

1488
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:57,800
Bro... - I don't think I'll be able 
to go to the marriage on the 10th.

1489
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,880
Then?

1490
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,600
It'll be bad if we don't go.

1491
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:01,680
Then?

1492
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,280
We'll meet.

1493
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:10,600
The function is on the 10th. 
Don't forget.

1494
01:16:15,160 --> 01:16:16,480
Hello!

1495
01:16:20,480 --> 01:16:23,000
I didn't propose to you seeing your 
father's wealth

1496
01:16:23,040 --> 01:16:26,680
or due to the sympathy that 
you are dumb.

1497
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:28,840
I proposed to you because I 
really love you.

1498
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,720
If you want, you can love me.

1499
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:44,480
Welcome to my mansion!

1500
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,840
I hope it is a mansion and 
not a jail.

1501
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:52,280
Come on.

1502
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,840
First you take bath 
and become fresh.

1503
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,120
After that we'll have dinner.

1504
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,560
Rest later on. 
Come on.

1505
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:02,800
AC.

1506
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,960
Romantic fragrance.

1507
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,320
Soft bed!

1508
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:14,800
You enjoy it man!

1509
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,320
From where did your Anju 
find this crazy man?

1510
01:17:21,080 --> 01:17:22,000
Look at me.

1511
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:24,120
I am going to tell 
I am not your heart throb.

1512
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,400
'You said you will stand by me'

1513
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,640
Your Mahesh will arrive now! 
You wait.

1514
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:38,800
What a trap is this! 
Oh God!

1515
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:40,560
Go and have bath. Go.

1516
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:42,160
Go.

1517
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,200
My God!

1518
01:17:58,800 --> 01:17:59,800
You rascal!

1519
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,760
You are trapped, isn't it?

1520
01:18:01,800 --> 01:18:03,480
I came to know only now.

1521
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,320
Hey!

1522
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:09,640
You meet Ima and try to 
explain the matters to her.

1523
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,640
She is in real anger.

1524
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:13,720
This was in the middle of her 
falling for me.

1525
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,520
She is not Ima, but devil.

1526
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,520
I don't think it'll work.

1527
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:21,120
Do you have any idea about that 
fraud lover?

1528
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:24,120
I think he has cheated 
that poor girl.

1529
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:26,560
Cheating in some place.

1530
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:27,800
Sacrifice in some place.

1531
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:29,200
That is what life is.

1532
01:18:29,240 --> 01:18:30,520
You get lost!

1533
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,160
No use of getting angry with me.

1534
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:33,880
I used to warn when you used to 
get into these problems.

1535
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:36,600
- Did you call me? 
- Hello! Hello!

1536
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:38,800
She is...

1537
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:40,680
taking bath.

1538
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:42,760
Oh God!

1539
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,240
What is it?

1540
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:48,040
What kind of a man are you?

1541
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,920
You must take bath together.

1542
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,160
Shuck!

1543
01:18:54,240 --> 01:18:59,440
You need some classes 
regarding this family life.

1544
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,120
I'll solve it.

1545
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:02,520
- Gautam! 
- Yes.

1546
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:05,320
Wait.

1547
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:10,440
Oh god!

1548
01:19:16,440 --> 01:19:19,520
After taking bath 
you look glamorous.

1549
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,280
It is for your sake.

1550
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:26,640
In a single day I became famous.

1551
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:48,400
From today onwards you both are 
entering into family life.

1552
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:50,560
First of all, congrats!

1553
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,200
Thank you! 
Thank you!

1554
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,960
Don't be over. 
One thank you is enough.

1555
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,600
One I told on her behalf.

1556
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:57,440
Is it? See,

1557
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:06,120
when two different hands unite with 
love, you'll get the symbol of heart.

1558
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,520
Am I right?

1559
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:09,800
Everybody knows that.

1560
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,040
Now,

1561
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,160
with the increase in love 
and understanding

1562
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,600
when you come close 
to each other,

1563
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,880
how will the heart change? 
Look.

1564
01:20:22,160 --> 01:20:23,840
- Diamond. 
- Diamond!

1565
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:29,240
That is, love will become 
the most precious diamond.

1566
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:30,360
Got it?

1567
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,320
I respect you.

1568
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:36,520
It is for the first time,

1569
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:39,880
Gautam is appreciated.

1570
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,360
Eight missed calls? 
What is it?

1571
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,360
Your librarian is a big show off.

1572
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:49,920
I phoned her to compromise 
the matters.

1573
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,400
She called me as bastard.

1574
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:54,560
You can laugh. Even my father hasn't 
addressed me like that.

1575
01:20:55,080 --> 01:20:57,000
Is it? That is because he doesn't 
know English.

1576
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,800
You fool! Don't have any connection 
with that girl.

1577
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,560
If you are a man, 
you must react.

1578
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:04,880
What reaction?

1579
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,840
You send me a tick-tok 
with that other girl.

1580
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:09,480
I'll forward it to that show off.

1581
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,640
Anicha!

1582
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,400
Can you hear what I am saying?

1583
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,560
Is there any shortage 
of range there?

1584
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,000
I can hear properly.

1585
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,680
Is it? 
Then you hear properly.

1586
01:21:18,720 --> 01:21:21,200
You scoundrel!

1587
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:37,200
You take this.

1588
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:41,280
I have trouble in serving.

1589
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,480
You eat yourself.

1590
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:45,200
I told you.

1591
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:47,720
No need for any formalities 
between us.

1592
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,960
Gautam, please! Let them eat.

1593
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,320
Okay, Neeli! Okay.

1594
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:55,600
Is this doctor like this 
from the past?

1595
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:57,800
With motivation and advice.

1596
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,920
He got it from China.

1597
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,040
Are you not eating?

1598
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,280
Serve liver fry to Mahesh.

1599
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,160
Let the liver transplantation 
of love take place.

1600
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:12,040
Doctor, I don't eat liver.

1601
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,560
- Don't you eat? 
- No.

1602
01:22:14,520 --> 01:22:15,840
Then you eat pomegranate.

1603
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,440
It won't be good to look at.

1604
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,040
But it is rich in nutrition.

1605
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,560
"Like a newly grown mango leaf..."

1606
01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:29,960
"You caressed me psychologically."

1607
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:33,600
"Due to shyness both the cheeks..."

1608
01:22:33,680 --> 01:22:37,840
"...developed dimples silently."

1609
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:40,640
Old poetries are a real pleasure!

1610
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:42,800
Music, rhyme.

1611
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,160
Love is flowing in that.

1612
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,160
- Why are you giggling? 
- Nothing.

1613
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:49,720
Love is flowing.

1614
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:52,000
That you told to flatter her, isn't it?

1615
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:54,040
He is not a right guy.

1616
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,480
Menon sir, shall I 
ask you one thing?

1617
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,800
Did you have a love marriage?

1618
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,480
I did love and marry.

1619
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,120
But I didn't marry the girl 
I loved.

1620
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:04,280
What happened?

1621
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,280
Dear, we must fall in love.

1622
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:08,200
But never marry the person we love.

1623
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:11,160
If you marry that person, 
the love will end there.

1624
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:12,480
Do you understand?

1625
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:15,360
"It is a pleasure when 
we don't own it."

1626
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,840
"What is the use if you are owned?"

1627
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,120
That is what love is.

1628
01:23:20,240 --> 01:23:22,720
Right. That is a correct point.

1629
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:26,840
It is a long time since you started to 
score points here.

1630
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:28,880
Go and do your job.

1631
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,040
Pass me that book.

1632
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:33,160
I'll take this.

1633
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,240
I have to go to Kozhikodu.

1634
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,080
My daughter is living there. 
- When will you be back?

1635
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:40,200
I'll stay there for 6 days.

1636
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:43,320
She keeps complaining that I 
don't visit her.

1637
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:46,080
So I have to rectify that.

1638
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:50,160
The price of the books that I am 
taking to Kozhikodu,

1639
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:52,480
I think I'll have to pay.

1640
01:23:52,520 --> 01:23:54,960
A fellow took it from me.

1641
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,280
Till now he hasn't returned it.

1642
01:23:56,360 --> 01:23:57,920
It is not price. 
It is rent.

1643
01:23:58,240 --> 01:24:01,400
It'll be more than its price.

1644
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,800
The rent! You thief!

1645
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:09,400
"I am eager to embrace you..."

1646
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:17,280
Perfect shock absorber.

1647
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:19,160
Is this enough? 
- More than enough.

1648
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:21,920
You naughty!

1649
01:24:21,960 --> 01:24:23,560
In the middle 
of this eloping,

1650
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,280
you must have forgotten to 
get some essential things.

1651
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:27,440
Don't worry man!

1652
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:28,440
I'll manage it.

1653
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,960
Okay? 
- Shuck!

1654
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,160
What 'shuck'? Take this.

1655
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:35,040
It is enough to have babies 
after two years of marriage.

1656
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,480
Some idiots will say proudly.

1657
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,360
The very next day their wife will 
become pregnant.

1658
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:40,920
That is the time. 
Use it.

1659
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:42,640
- Oh God! 
- Please do it!

1660
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:43,760
Doctor!

1661
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:47,000
- This won't work. 
- What man?

1662
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,840
Deepika, take this.

1663
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,360
Go.

1664
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,400
You smile...smile...

1665
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:57,160
You are going to the bedroom, isn't it?

1666
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:58,360
Not to the death house, right?

1667
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,600
You smile and go.

1668
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:01,880
You go.

1669
01:25:04,960 --> 01:25:06,320
Seeing her tension

1670
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,200
we'll think someone unwanted 
has married her.

1671
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,440
Take this. Drink.

1672
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:19,000
Increase your vitamin.

1673
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:20,200
Let it increase.

1674
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:26,320
Aah.

1675
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,280
This first night set up

1676
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,600
is good, isn't it?

1677
01:25:35,600 --> 01:25:37,640
What to do to pass the time?

1678
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:40,520
There is lot of commotion.

1679
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,080
Give him a kick, dear!

1680
01:25:42,120 --> 01:25:43,560
What a dialogue!

1681
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,720
From two days Menon 
sir is enquiring about you.

1682
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:47,800
What for?

1683
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,560
Why don't you return that book?

1684
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,760
Gopika is saying that it was 
brought from some library.

1685
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:57,280
Ancestors have said, woman and 
book must never be exchanged.

1686
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,600
Both will never come back.

1687
01:25:58,640 --> 01:25:59,960
He doesn't know that.

1688
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:01,760
- What a man! 
- Excuse me!

1689
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:03,920
What is it?

1690
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:05,000
Do you want any tips?

1691
01:26:05,080 --> 01:26:06,400
Nothing. 
- Then?

1692
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,440
Can you give me the 
key of that bike?

1693
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,520
Where are you going?

1694
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:11,480
To go for a ride.

1695
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:12,920
- Now? 
- Yeah!

1696
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,400
- Bike is in the poach. Take it. 
- Thanks!

1697
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:16,640
Thank God!

1698
01:26:16,680 --> 01:26:17,960
He is a fool!

1699
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:21,120
On the day of getting a girl in 
hand, he is going to roam around.

1700
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,720
Is she also going?

1701
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:26,560
Will their first night be on road?

1702
01:26:26,640 --> 01:26:28,120
Street night!

1703
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:44,680
In between the first night in 
Mangalapuram,

1704
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:47,240
you are a girl who should have taken 
a commercial break.

1705
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:49,720
You are standing here taking 
the support of a boat.

1706
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:53,120
How did you get the 
courage to elope?

1707
01:26:53,160 --> 01:26:55,960
Hello! What is it?

1708
01:26:56,040 --> 01:26:57,360
What?

1709
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,000
It is quite some time since 
you both started to romance.

1710
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:01,160
Is it?

1711
01:27:01,240 --> 01:27:03,440
Is there any time limit for romancing?

1712
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,040
Why don't you go home?

1713
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,280
What is your problem?

1714
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,920
- Do you want to know? 
- Yeah!

1715
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:11,240
Are you doing sweet talk at this 
mid night?

1716
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:12,760
Who are you?

1717
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,160
Hello! Hello!

1718
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:15,760
You talk to me.

1719
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,680
Who are you? 
Should I gather people?

1720
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,240
You leave the place.

1721
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:23,120
Are you from puritan ethic police?

1722
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:25,520
Who gave you this job?

1723
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:26,960
I am asking to know.

1724
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,480
Don't you know about the 
Supreme Court judgment?

1725
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:30,800
Anybody who prefer

1726
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:33,520
can sit wherever they want without 
being a nuisance to others.

1727
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:34,600
You leave.

1728
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:36,160
Go, go.

1729
01:27:37,680 --> 01:27:40,640
If they see two people in love, 
they'll come and kill.

1730
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:42,160
If they see them fighting,

1731
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,440
they'll take the video of it happily 
and share it.

1732
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:46,760
How will this country develop?

1733
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:48,920
Am I right?

1734
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:53,960
'You are a nice guy'

1735
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,080
Now only you'll say that I am nice.

1736
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,120
For the others, now I am a minus.

1737
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:03,880
Now this mobile is not 
a solution for you.

1738
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,680
No use of waiting for him.

1739
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,440
You think in a practical manner.

1740
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:11,040
I'll give you some options.

1741
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,280
Plan A.

1742
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,840
You must return back home.

1743
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:18,600
There will be some commotion, 
disgrace and fight.

1744
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,600
It'll be okay after some time.

1745
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:23,000
Plan B.

1746
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:28,960
With one of your friends you try 
to live in some other city.

1747
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,080
You can get a good job, isn't it?

1748
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:34,600
Do you know anyone like 
that in Bangalore or Mangalore?

1749
01:28:37,640 --> 01:28:39,840
Now Plan C.

1750
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,560
For the time being I can't return to 
my native with this image.

1751
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:43,760
You also can't go back.

1752
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,000
We both have to live.

1753
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:50,040
I have got only one option.

1754
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,280
'Deepi, it's me Mahesh.. 
Where are you? Call this number'

1755
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:12,880
Hello!

1756
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:13,680
Hello Mahesh!

1757
01:29:13,720 --> 01:29:14,880
Deepi, hello!

1758
01:29:14,920 --> 01:29:16,120
I am Vivek.

1759
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:19,080
- Where is Deepika? 
- She is with me.

1760
01:29:19,120 --> 01:29:21,520
- Where are you both? 
- Tell me what happened.

1761
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,440
He is in Kottayam. 
You don't be afraid.

1762
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,840
'Where have you reached?'

1763
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:29,840
'Thinking about the family, 
I am very scared'

1764
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,840
It is because they didn't 
agree, isn't it?

1765
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:34,160
You don't think about all that now. 
Remain cool.

1766
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:36,840
I'll reach on time. You don't 
be afraid. Okay?

1767
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,720
Today is a decisive day in 
your life, isn't it?

1768
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,360
I tried to conduct it in a 
straight forward manner.

1769
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:47,600
But there is no other 
alternative than eloping.

1770
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,640
For us also today is a decisive day.

1771
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,960
By today our big problem 
might get solved.

1772
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:59,160
Not all of us.

1773
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:01,600
The problem of a full village.

1774
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,920
Is the child sleeping? From the time 
I got in, I have been noticing.

1775
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,280
Let her sleep.

1776
01:30:07,240 --> 01:30:09,360
So many children are 
sleeping in hunger here.

1777
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,000
What about the child's mother?

1778
01:30:12,080 --> 01:30:13,840
There are many motherless children.

1779
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:18,680
So you came for the programme and 
are you leaving with the child?

1780
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:19,760
No.

1781
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:21,960
Today she is our guest.

1782
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:23,760
Where was the programme yesterday?

1783
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:26,120
In the VJT hall of Thiruvananthapuram.

1784
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,000
There are people who did 
revolution by singing song.

1785
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,400
We are left with only voice breaking.

1786
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:36,200
Nobody is taking our 
song as music.

1787
01:30:36,720 --> 01:30:38,720
Everybody is saying it is screaming.

1788
01:30:39,400 --> 01:30:42,480
To avoid the boredom of this 
journey, why don't you sing a song?

1789
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,840
We don't sing just like that.

1790
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:47,080
Why? Will you sing only on 
getting money?

1791
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:48,880
No.

1792
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:51,120
It is circumstances which 
make us sing.

1793
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:17,920
- I think it is there. 
- There?

1794
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:20,000
Seat No. 3?

1795
01:31:20,280 --> 01:31:21,400
See.

1796
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,760
This is local ticket.

1797
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,360
You can board in sleeper class.

1798
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,000
Then what will we do?

1799
01:31:28,040 --> 01:31:30,520
No problem. Get down in the 
next station and change.

1800
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,480
She is not feeling well.

1801
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:33,840
She has got asthma.

1802
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,400
You sit here.

1803
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:37,920
I'll tell when the TTR comes.

1804
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:42,000
- You sit there. 
- You can sit here.

1805
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:43,680
You sit here.

1806
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,120
Take your ticket.

1807
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:53,520
We didn't buy anything 
while coming..

1808
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:55,920
What to do now?

1809
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:57,800
We'll buy on the way.

1810
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:00,000
Tea...coffee...

1811
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,400
Coffee...

1812
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,960
Where are you both going?

1813
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,880
We are going to Vega Land.

1814
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:07,480
- Is it? 
- Good.

1815
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:11,320
At this age, in which ride are you 
going to go in Vega Land?

1816
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:15,280
At this age we are travelling in train 
for the first time.

1817
01:32:15,320 --> 01:32:17,160
It is interesting.

1818
01:32:17,240 --> 01:32:18,640
Why did you tell that?

1819
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,040
Then what?

1820
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:22,640
What is there in that? 
It is a good thing.

1821
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:25,920
Then...you have something to tell.

1822
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,360
Am I right?

1823
01:32:30,520 --> 01:32:32,480
If you don't wish to tell, 
it is okay.

1824
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,160
Uh...

1825
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,160
So you have really got something 
to tell.

1826
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:37,360
Please tell!

1827
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,200
In a very young age

1828
01:32:41,280 --> 01:32:44,440
we both loved and got 
married by eloping.

1829
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:46,720
That too we belong to two 
different castes.

1830
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,040
So I don't have to tell.

1831
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:50,160
You remain silent.

1832
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:53,200
There was nobody there for help.

1833
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,720
By eloping we started our life 
in a hill place.

1834
01:32:55,760 --> 01:32:58,880
Then that place became our world.

1835
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,680
By God's grace we didn't 
have a child.

1836
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:18,200
Like you both, I am also 
eloping with a girl.

1837
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:19,360
Is it?

1838
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,280
She'll board this 
train from Eranakulam.

1839
01:33:21,880 --> 01:33:24,400
In my matter also the reason is the 
same as yours.

1840
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:28,760
You must have given that girl 
a lot of hopes, isn't it?

1841
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:31,480
You must fulfill all that.

1842
01:33:32,280 --> 01:33:33,880
During dating time

1843
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:36,400
I gave her lot of hopes.

1844
01:33:36,440 --> 01:33:38,640
A life of comfort.

1845
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:40,720
But nothing happened.

1846
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:42,480
After we started our life together,

1847
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:46,600
I couldn't fulfill even a single 
wish of hers.

1848
01:33:47,160 --> 01:33:51,880
Inspite of working so hard our 
limits and responsibilities

1849
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,320
haven't ended even now.

1850
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:57,880
Sometimes our life was 
taken away by storm.

1851
01:33:57,920 --> 01:34:00,840
Sometimes there was rain.

1852
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,720
Sometimes there were 
intermediates.

1853
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,480
There is nothing left.

1854
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:10,960
But I have no 
complaints in that.

1855
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:15,320
Even if I didn't get anything, 
he is there with me.

1856
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:20,600
By constantly loving me, 
she developed asthma.

1857
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:25,720
Thinking that luck will 
be with us one day

1858
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:29,960
from many years, every month 
I buy a lottery ticket.

1859
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,440
First time in my life

1860
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:33,880
I won lottery.

1861
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,600
Rs 5000 of Karunya Plus.

1862
01:34:37,800 --> 01:34:40,520
We are not in a position to go 
for pleasure trip.

1863
01:34:41,640 --> 01:34:47,200
Even then, to fulfill one wish 
of hers we left with that money.

1864
01:34:47,240 --> 01:34:49,720
We must go to Eranakulam 
and return back.

1865
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:50,720
Isn't it?

1866
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:12,800
"Even after knowing everything is 
a problem, you came along with me..."

1867
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:22,880
"Even when I was in full debt, 
you didn't leave me."

1868
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:34,600
"Even when the family members blamed 
me, you supported me."

1869
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:44,920
"Even when compatriots accused me, 
you remained as my companion."

1870
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:55,000
"You spent your good age by 
suffering inside my house."

1871
01:35:56,080 --> 01:36:06,880
"You hugged me even when I came without 
buying new dress for you for Onam."

1872
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:12,880
"You hugged me..."

1873
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:23,160
"Even after knowing everything is 
a problem, you came along with me..."

1874
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:29,920
"Even when I was in full debt, 
you didn't leave me."

1875
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:36,720
"Even when the family members blamed 
me, you supported me."

1876
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:43,400
"Even when compatriots accused me, 
you remained as my companion."

1877
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:49,840
"You spent your good age by suffering 
inside my house."

1878
01:36:49,920 --> 01:36:56,480
"You hugged me even when I came without 
buying new dress for you for Onam."

1879
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:59,520
"You hugged me..."

1880
01:36:59,600 --> 01:37:03,560
"You hugged me..."

1881
01:37:11,560 --> 01:37:13,520
Isn't it this child which is 
with them?

1882
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:42,600
Isn't this the child that is 
there with you?

1883
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,000
I am not objecting.

1884
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:51,840
Is this child the solution 
to the problem that you told?

1885
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,120
Don't stand there. Stand here.

1886
01:37:58,880 --> 01:37:59,800
I told you, isn't it?

1887
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:01,840
Today is a decisive day for us.

1888
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:05,280
I don't wish to go 
deep into this matter.

1889
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,280
You haven't seen this message.

1890
01:38:08,840 --> 01:38:10,560
Then there is no problem between us.

1891
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:12,600
We'll go and sit there.

1892
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:13,720
Come, come on.

1893
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:14,960
No need.

1894
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:16,680
I'll stand here.

1895
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,440
You can't stand without us. 
Come.

1896
01:38:21,720 --> 01:38:24,160
How smartly you are threatening me!

1897
01:38:29,240 --> 01:38:30,680
This is a mission.

1898
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:34,320
It is not right or wrong but 
the goal is what is important.

1899
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,960
You entered this unknowingly.

1900
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:39,520
The matters that we tell,

1901
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,240
you may not be able to understand.

1902
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:43,200
It is the problem of your age.

1903
01:38:43,640 --> 01:38:44,920
This is a fight.

1904
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:49,000
The fight for survival. 
Not mine.

1905
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:50,240
But many people.

1906
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:52,360
You must help.

1907
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:54,200
It is a request.

1908
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,040
What you are saying 
or what is your mission

1909
01:38:57,120 --> 01:38:58,120
I don't know.

1910
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:00,360
Holding the life of an innocent child

1911
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,560
what fight are you doing?

1912
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:03,120
Silently! Silently!

1913
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,480
This is not a fight with just a child.

1914
01:39:07,080 --> 01:39:08,920
This is the fight for many children who 
are alive

1915
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,720
and who are still going to take birth.

1916
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:13,200
You must help.

1917
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:16,240
It is a command.

1918
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:17,840
Why should I obey you?

1919
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,880
There are laws and regulations in 
this country.

1920
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:21,200
Whatever you may say,

1921
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:22,880
I can't support you.

1922
01:39:23,040 --> 01:39:24,160
I'll report this.

1923
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,400
A girl is waiting for you in Eranakulam 
railway station.

1924
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:30,720
A life with her is your dream, isn't it?

1925
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,720
We don't wish to harm you.

1926
01:39:34,120 --> 01:39:35,120
Please!

1927
01:39:35,480 --> 01:39:36,560
Don't compel me.

1928
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:39,280
Take your hands off. Whatever you 
may say,

1929
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,800
I'll not stand by you.

1930
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:49,720
Hey, leave.

1931
01:39:50,480 --> 01:39:53,880
Guys! We must get down here. 
Come on guys! Come on!

1932
01:39:53,960 --> 01:39:56,400
Come soon, something has happened there.

1933
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,280
He must not escape at any cost.

1934
01:39:58,320 --> 01:40:00,160
Something has happened. 
What happened?

1935
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,440
Stop there! Stop!

1936
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,400
Don't run. Stop!

1937
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,040
Come on.

1938
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,560
Stop!

1939
01:40:10,840 --> 01:40:12,920
- Catch him. 
- He must not escape.

1940
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,960
Make it fast.

1941
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,440
Stop!

1942
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:31,760
- Hey, stop! 
- Stop!

1943
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,520
Stop!

1944
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:38,440
- Hey! 
- Catch him.

1945
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:54,960
Take your hands off.

1946
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:56,680
Okay.

1947
01:40:56,840 --> 01:40:58,040
We are not communist.

1948
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:02,160
We don't see this as a crime.

1949
01:41:03,400 --> 01:41:05,160
Till this mission is over,

1950
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:08,640
we must put you to sleep.

1951
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:10,160
I am sorry!

1952
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,280
What happened to the protesters then?

1953
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,880
Now I have a respect for you

1954
01:41:40,920 --> 01:41:44,200
There is no history of failing protests

1955
01:41:44,240 --> 01:41:47,080
Protestors can be killed 
but not be defeated

1956
01:41:47,160 --> 01:41:51,600
Haven't you heard? 
The opposition whatsoever..

1957
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:54,760
..more likely the protests 
will get victorious

1958
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:56,320
If not today, it will happen someday

1959
01:41:56,400 --> 01:41:57,880
That is history

1960
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,000
Hey, please!

1961
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,040
Stop on the right side.

1962
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,080
- EC to station. 
- Are you okay?

1963
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:16,440
- I am okay, sir. 
- Do you want water?

1964
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:17,680
- Water. 
- Get some water.

1965
01:42:17,760 --> 01:42:18,480
From which area?

1966
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:20,840
We have got him near about from the area 
about which the criminals told.

1967
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:21,760
Is there any problem?

1968
01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:24,040
- SI sir is talking to him. 
- You drink.

1969
01:42:24,080 --> 01:42:24,920
Okay.

1970
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:28,640
Relax!

1971
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:37,600
Sir, some people sedated me from

1972
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:39,400
railway station and dropped me here.

1973
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:42,440
I know everything. We arrested 
all of them from the racket.

1974
01:42:42,520 --> 01:42:43,880
That child is safe.

1975
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,160
You need not worry.

1976
01:42:45,240 --> 01:42:47,360
It is good that you recognized them.

1977
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:49,120
That is why they got down in Kottayam.

1978
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:51,160
Accidentally we arrested them.

1979
01:42:51,240 --> 01:42:54,400
From the details that we got from the 
criminals, we came in search of you.

1980
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:56,400
We'll take you to the hospital soon.

1981
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,160
Sir, I don't want to go to the hospital.

1982
01:42:58,240 --> 01:42:58,960
Then?

1983
01:42:59,040 --> 01:43:00,680
A girl trusted me and came away 
with me.

1984
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:02,560
She is a dumb girl.

1985
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:04,680
I don't even know where she is now.

1986
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,440
I want to contact her.

1987
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,720
Can you give me your mobile?

1988
01:43:10,440 --> 01:43:12,080
Take care of her.

1989
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,280
I'll start now itself. Please!

1990
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:15,920
Send me the location.

1991
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:17,720
Now itself I'll send the location map.

1992
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:18,800
Don't be tensed.

1993
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:20,040
- Come soon. 
- Okay.

1994
01:43:21,160 --> 01:43:21,920
- Sir. 
- What?

1995
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:23,160
I need to go to Kozhikodu.

1996
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:26,040
If it is not an issue, can you 
arrange for a vehicle?

1997
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:28,360
You need not go like this.

1998
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:29,880
Come, we'll make arrangement. 
Hey!

1999
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:31,680
- You make him sit in the jeep. 
- Yes, sir!

2000
01:43:33,480 --> 01:43:36,040
Finally, your hero comes.

2001
01:44:13,640 --> 01:44:18,440
"I think of that first pleasure."

2002
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:23,240
"Evening music of happiness."

2003
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:27,640
"I think of that first pleasure."

2004
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:32,440
"Evening music of happiness."

2005
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:38,320
"In that eyes filled with 
blue sea water..."

2006
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:43,040
"The time I saw the depth 
of soulful music."

2007
01:44:43,120 --> 01:44:47,520
"I am unable to express the 
pain of separation."

2008
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:52,360
"The delight in the youthful heart 
wrote the story of life."

2009
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:57,240
"The footprints on the path will 
leave its sign."

2010
01:44:57,320 --> 01:45:01,520
"Why should we think about 
it anymore?"

2011
01:45:31,680 --> 01:45:36,520
"With clouds the door was 
closed slowly."

2012
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,920
"The way midnight moon leaves."

2013
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:46,240
"Dear you'll disappear in my eyes."

2014
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:50,680
"I'll cross any distance for your sake."

2015
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:55,800
"It became a magical relationship."

2016
01:45:55,840 --> 01:46:00,200
"Soulful music became a chanting."

2017
01:46:00,720 --> 01:46:05,520
"Will you arrive in this as 
romantic tune?"

2018
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,880
"My heart will beat at nights 
thinking of you."

2019
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:14,840
"The delight in the youthful heart 
wrote the story of life."

2020
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,680
"The footprints on the path will 
leave its sign."

2021
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:25,120
"Why should we think about 
it anymore?"

2022
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:59,000
"I am waiting for you like 
water in the heat."

2023
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:03,120
"Flowery wind embraced the atmosphere."

2024
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:08,640
"Thousands of lonely nights passed by."

2025
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:13,360
"In the sob of a person."

2026
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:18,200
"Without falling in wind it is 
shaking."

2027
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:22,840
"From years onwards you are 
the wick in the heart."

2028
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:28,000
"Will you present me with all 
the happiness?"

2029
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:32,480
"It is the time to 
soak in the pleasure."

2030
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:37,160
"I think of that first pleasure."

2031
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:42,080
"Evening music of happiness."

2032
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:47,520
"In that eyes filled with 
blue sea water..."

2033
01:47:47,600 --> 01:47:52,280
"The time I saw the depth 
of soulful music."

2034
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:56,680
"I am unable to express the 
pain of separation."

2035
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:01,360
"The delight in the youthful heart 
wrote the story of life."

2036
01:48:01,440 --> 01:48:06,480
"The footprints on the path will 
leave its sign."

2037
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,200
"The delight in the youthful heart 
wrote the story of life."

2038
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:16,040
"The footprints on the path will 
leave its sign."

2039
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:21,440
"Why should we think about 
it anymore?"

2040
01:48:27,640 --> 01:48:29,200
Now what will we tell him?

2041
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,240
Dr. Gautam MBBS.

2042
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,160
He should be named as 
'Made in China' also.

2043
01:48:35,640 --> 01:48:37,560
- Good morning! 
- Good morning!

2044
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:41,720
You must be the first couple to have 
celebrated first night in outdoor.

2045
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:42,800
Thank you!

2046
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,880
No need for all that any more.

2047
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:46,480
I have arranged for the license.

2048
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:49,120
- He is mad. 
- You told her that I am mad, isn't it?

2049
01:48:49,280 --> 01:48:50,360
Not that.

2050
01:48:50,840 --> 01:48:52,280
If children make mistake,

2051
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,360
elders will punish or rebuke them.

2052
01:48:54,840 --> 01:48:57,080
If intelligent people like me intervene,

2053
01:48:57,120 --> 01:48:59,600
they'll forgive without punishment 
and rebuke.

2054
01:49:00,320 --> 01:49:01,920
What is he saying?

2055
01:49:02,480 --> 01:49:05,400
It is difficult for me to 
shelter you people

2056
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:08,080
for many days like others. It is 
quiet natural.

2057
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,960
So, yesterday night itself

2058
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:12,600
I got into a night conversation.

2059
01:49:14,040 --> 01:49:15,440
You don't understand, isn't it?

2060
01:49:15,840 --> 01:49:17,680
Your problems are over.

2061
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,560
Your love has been accepted by 
the family members.

2062
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,120
It is only that it can't 
take place in the planned time.

2063
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:28,160
Reception time can be made as 
the auspicious time.

2064
01:49:28,520 --> 01:49:30,520
For that they will 
come here to take you.

2065
01:49:31,720 --> 01:49:33,040
Main hurdle is crossed.

2066
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:36,160
I am trapped. This is going to 
be a problem.

2067
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:38,800
Why do you look unsatisfied?

2068
01:49:39,040 --> 01:49:41,840
- Doctor, I need to tell you one thing. 
- Tell me.

2069
01:49:41,880 --> 01:49:44,440
Only you can do something.

2070
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,760
I have already done.

2071
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:47,040
Without even your knowledge.

2072
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,080
It is not that.

2073
01:49:48,120 --> 01:49:49,720
You need not be afraid.

2074
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,640
All your problems will end.

2075
01:49:51,680 --> 01:49:55,080
Just now Anju called and told that 
Deepika's father and uncle are coming.

2076
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,800
- Yes. 
- You are happy, isn't it?

2077
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,880
What is it? Are you getting hiccups?

2078
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:00,720
- Means hiccup. 
- Neelima sister!

2079
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,280
Can you give me water to drink?

2080
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,680
It is hiccup, isn't it? No problem. 
Just now first night is over.

2081
01:50:04,720 --> 01:50:06,240
It's alright. Cool! It's okay.

2082
01:50:07,120 --> 01:50:08,080
They have arrived.

2083
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:10,400
Oh God! The decision has been taken.

2084
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:22,960
Dear!

2085
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,680
It is okay. It happened.

2086
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,920
There is mistake from my side also.

2087
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:32,600
Thinking that you are handicapped,

2088
01:50:32,640 --> 01:50:35,280
I tried to get a guy by paying for it.

2089
01:50:36,720 --> 01:50:38,920
But, by understanding your shortfalls,

2090
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:42,120
he agreed to give you a life.

2091
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:43,520
You didn't do anything wrong 
by leaving with him.

2092
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,200
You are the one who is correct. 
Come.

2093
01:50:45,240 --> 01:50:47,560
Everybody was called. We'll 
leave now itself.

2094
01:50:47,600 --> 01:50:49,360
By evening we'll conduct 
the rituals.

2095
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:54,360
There is not much role for us 
in this emotional scene.

2096
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:57,000
Let those 4 to 5 minds unite.

2097
01:50:58,840 --> 01:51:01,880
Mahesh, I am Deepika's younger uncle.

2098
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:03,440
Don't you know him?

2099
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:05,320
Sanil, he is Deepika's brother.

2100
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,280
Okay.

2101
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:08,880
We'll talk to your family 
members.

2102
01:51:09,920 --> 01:51:11,520
Tomorrow is the marriage day.

2103
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,400
It is good if we could 
reach by the reception time.

2104
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,920
We'll explain to the people.

2105
01:51:17,960 --> 01:51:19,800
What are you doing?

2106
01:51:19,840 --> 01:51:21,840
Make them sit in the car.

2107
01:51:22,360 --> 01:51:23,720
People are like this.

2108
01:51:24,120 --> 01:51:25,880
Whether it is important or not,

2109
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:28,240
they'll keep digging like this 
in any condition.

2110
01:51:28,320 --> 01:51:29,320
Sorry!

2111
01:51:29,400 --> 01:51:30,440
What is this?

2112
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:31,840
Doctor, we thank you!

2113
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,200
It is your who opened my eyes.

2114
01:51:34,840 --> 01:51:37,480
We doctors even open the heart.

2115
01:51:37,560 --> 01:51:39,720
Haven't you heard about 
open heart surgery?

2116
01:51:41,200 --> 01:51:44,040
Doctor, you also come. You can 
return as soon as the function is over.

2117
01:51:44,920 --> 01:51:46,840
Eranakulam! Long drive.

2118
01:51:47,240 --> 01:51:49,160
Sorry, she is carrying.

2119
01:51:49,600 --> 01:51:50,960
I am also carrying her.

2120
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,160
Officially you get them married.

2121
01:51:54,200 --> 01:51:56,480
I'll sponsor the honeymoon 
in China.

2122
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,800
My Beijing colleagues will 
take care of them.

2123
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:01,000
Mahesh, are you happy?

2124
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,160
Be happy.

2125
01:52:08,160 --> 01:52:10,400
Does he have patients?

2126
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,760
Even if there are no patients, 
we his ancestors are rich,

2127
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:17,360
he can enjoy and live like this. 
Doctor! Doctor!

2128
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:19,320
Did you say anything?

2129
01:52:19,560 --> 01:52:21,920
Even if your ancestors are not rich,

2130
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,960
by your talent you can live 
in comfort like this, I said.

2131
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,160
You have got sense.

2132
01:52:26,360 --> 01:52:28,400
An happy function is going 
on there.

2133
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:29,960
To make it an auspicious occasion, 
you come.

2134
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,320
The sign is good.

2135
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:33,320
First you give back that book.

2136
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,240
I have to leave for Eranakulam 
today evening.

2137
01:52:35,320 --> 01:52:37,040
I'll give you the book. 
You come.

2138
01:52:37,080 --> 01:52:38,280
Come on.

2139
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:43,160
Help me. I have no issue in climbing. 
Hold me tightly.

2140
01:52:43,720 --> 01:52:44,840
Menon sir.

2141
01:52:44,880 --> 01:52:45,880
You scoundrel!

2142
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:47,600
- What to do? 
- What are you doing here?

2143
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:48,600
Go man.

2144
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,760
What cheap act did you do in the train?

2145
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:53,440
- Now it has become inauspicious. 
- Hey, what's happening man?

2146
01:52:54,160 --> 01:52:55,320
Do you know Mahesh?

2147
01:52:55,960 --> 01:52:57,800
Mahesh? He is Vivek.

2148
01:52:58,120 --> 01:52:59,720
A man with no sense.

2149
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,480
Now not only to me but everyone 
in the world knows him.

2150
01:53:02,520 --> 01:53:03,440
He is a womanizer.

2151
01:53:03,480 --> 01:53:04,760
I don't understand.

2152
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:06,920
I'll explain to you.

2153
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,200
In Eranakulam,

2154
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:12,040
this rascal chased a girl from 
a good family.

2155
01:53:12,120 --> 01:53:13,880
He tried to charm her.

2156
01:53:14,160 --> 01:53:15,240
That I know.

2157
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:17,400
Yesterday in train,

2158
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:20,240
he misbehaved with some other girl.

2159
01:53:20,320 --> 01:53:23,600
Now he is calling himself as Mahesh.

2160
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:25,800
You tell the truth.

2161
01:53:26,280 --> 01:53:28,040
Are you a fraud?

2162
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:29,640
In Eranakulam you are Vivek.

2163
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:31,800
In Kozhikodu you are Mahesh.

2164
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:34,200
In Sultan Batheri you are 
Sunil Shetty.

2165
01:53:34,360 --> 01:53:36,040
Tell me who you are.

2166
01:53:36,840 --> 01:53:38,760
I was suspicious of him from the 
time I saw him.

2167
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,680
Father scolded me when I tried to 
get that video. See here.

2168
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:44,400
Listen to what I have to say.

2169
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:45,760
You need not say anything.

2170
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:48,120
How did you have the heart to

2171
01:53:48,160 --> 01:53:49,960
cheat my girl who is a dumb?

2172
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:53,280
- Come here. What did you think? 
- Please!

2173
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:54,400
Where are you going? 
Stop!

2174
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:56,080
- Is this your job? 
- You don't know.

2175
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,600
You have landed in trouble.

2176
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,720
Are you trying to cheat our 
dumb sister?

2177
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:00,920
Beat him.

2178
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:05,040
Bash him.

2179
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,680
Who is this new character?

2180
01:54:49,240 --> 01:54:50,360
Beat and kill him.

2181
01:54:52,120 --> 01:54:54,120
Do you want only my sister?

2182
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,440
If you are beating him for kidnapping 
your sister,

2183
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,440
you can beat me. I did it.

2184
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:10,120
If you come there, 
we'll kill you. Rascal!

2185
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:25,080
Why are you taking the beating?

2186
01:55:25,160 --> 01:55:26,680
You could have told everything.

2187
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:30,280
There was no time for that.

2188
01:55:30,360 --> 01:55:31,760
They attacked me in no time.

2189
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:37,160
How will I thank you for all this?

2190
01:55:37,480 --> 01:55:39,720
No need for all that.

2191
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:44,600
To all these people you are a villain.

2192
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:50,840
Everybody here only knows the hero

2193
01:55:51,160 --> 01:55:52,640
who fights and wins.

2194
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:56,760
The heroes who take the beating 
and lose for the others

2195
01:55:57,160 --> 01:55:58,200
are also here.

2196
01:55:59,160 --> 01:56:02,080
You are my hero!

2197
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:13,160
Shall we leave then? Son, 
sorry for everything.

2198
01:56:13,240 --> 01:56:14,360
It's okay, uncle.

2199
01:56:21,720 --> 01:56:22,760
- Shall I leave? 
- All the best!

2200
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:23,880
Okay!

2201
01:56:24,680 --> 01:56:25,720
Come.

2202
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,360
All the best!

2203
01:56:50,960 --> 01:56:53,720
You are not a bad guy

2204
01:56:53,760 --> 01:56:55,880
as I thought, isn't it?

2205
01:56:59,360 --> 01:57:01,240
A real good person!

2206
01:57:06,360 --> 01:57:07,640
Menon sir!

2207
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:09,280
In story there is always twist, 
isn't it?

2208
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:11,320
The twist is not in story alone.

2209
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:15,040
ST 23/2019, Ramakrishnan's son...

2210
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:16,560
Have you committed crime?

2211
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:18,000
Yes.

2212
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:22,600
I don't know the rules here.

2213
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:27,000
But he jumped only to save me.

2214
01:57:27,360 --> 01:57:29,760
It is then that the police arrested him.

2215
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:33,080
Who is this person not in the 
records?

2216
01:57:33,360 --> 01:57:35,600
In the FIR only the thief, who 
fell in the well is there.

2217
01:57:35,960 --> 01:57:37,600
Your honor!

2218
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,240
What do you have to say?

2219
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:43,640
I...in the well...

2220
01:57:44,280 --> 01:57:46,400
In the well? Why did you go to the well?

2221
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:50,240
Why are you crying?

2222
01:57:52,240 --> 01:57:54,440
Without crying, you tell what happened.

2223
01:57:56,200 --> 01:57:57,680
Don't waste the time of the court.

2224
01:57:57,720 --> 01:57:59,400
What is your connection 
with the case?

2225
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:02,480
Please allow to tell.

2226
01:58:02,600 --> 01:58:04,880
I think that girl is scared.

2227
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:06,600
What is happening here?

2228
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:09,040
Why has a person, who is not in the 
FIR come to the court?

2229
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:11,280
What discrepancy had 
taken place in this case?

2230
01:58:11,720 --> 01:58:13,000
What do you have to tell?

2231
01:58:13,440 --> 01:58:14,760
In the lord Shiva's temple

2232
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:17,920
I was trying to break open the hundi. 
People tried to catch me that time.

2233
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,240
In an unknown place

2234
01:58:19,280 --> 01:58:21,240
I rushed in the darkness.

2235
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:23,320
That time I fell in the well 
unknowingly.

2236
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:25,560
Morning when she came to get water,

2237
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:28,040
she got scared of me 
and fell in the well.

2238
01:58:29,160 --> 01:58:30,840
There are problems in this.

2239
01:58:31,360 --> 01:58:33,240
I smell suicide effort.

2240
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:36,080
Don't you know that committing 
suicide is a crime?

2241
01:58:36,240 --> 01:58:38,560
Court can file a case 
by itself.

2242
01:58:38,640 --> 01:58:40,600
That...in well...

2243
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,480
She became scared of me and fell.

2244
01:58:43,240 --> 01:58:46,400
Did you fall when the people chased 
you in the middle of theft?

2245
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:48,120
Is there any change in that?

2246
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:49,280
No.

2247
01:58:50,120 --> 01:58:52,120
The matter is not very convincing.

2248
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,280
Let him remain in remand.

2249
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:00,600
Why did you say like that?

2250
01:59:00,640 --> 01:59:03,360
Why didn't you tell that you jumped 
to save me?

2251
01:59:03,400 --> 01:59:04,920
You could have escaped.

2252
01:59:05,480 --> 01:59:08,280
There is a truth in all thefts.

2253
01:59:08,680 --> 01:59:10,000
That is what is correct.

2254
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:11,800
Let it remain like that.

2255
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:15,080
If your love is true,

2256
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:17,600
the boy who ditched you, 
will return.

2257
01:59:18,640 --> 01:59:20,640
Even if he doesn't return,

2258
01:59:21,280 --> 01:59:23,440
she doesn't deserve your love.

2259
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:24,920
I'll leave.

2260
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:32,720
I think he might come to me.

2261
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,080
Like how it happened in their life.

2262
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:41,840
- Bro Vivek! 
- Hi!

2263
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
- Hi! 
- Hi!

2264
01:59:44,360 --> 01:59:45,560
Hi buddy!

2265
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:49,440
- Welcome back. 
- Thank you! Thank you so much!

2266
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,960
Hi man!

2267
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:54,600
- Sir... 
- Do you know,

2268
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:56,160
Carnival cares for its employees.

2269
01:59:56,200 --> 01:59:57,760
As well as its moral ethics.

2270
01:59:58,400 --> 02:00:02,160
Any company will be conscious 
about its employees moral side.

2271
02:00:02,600 --> 02:00:04,680
It'll directly affect our 
reputation.

2272
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,360
On hearing such a news about you

2273
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:09,240
we could react only like that.

2274
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:11,960
But, on knowing you are innocent,

2275
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:14,240
same time the company called you back.

2276
02:00:15,560 --> 02:00:17,840
Carnival is an employee 
friendly company.

2277
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,440
Sir.

2278
02:00:23,720 --> 02:00:25,160
- Sir, excuse me! 
- Okay.

2279
02:00:28,320 --> 02:00:29,240
Sorry!

2280
02:00:31,040 --> 02:00:33,000
Sorry...It's alright, Ima.

2281
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:37,080
I was in love with you.

2282
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:40,600
You knew that very well.

2283
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:43,720
Many times I came 
to express that to you.

2284
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:47,120
But do you know what you told me?

2285
02:00:47,640 --> 02:00:49,800
You have only friendship with me.

2286
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,960
If you had been a good friend,

2287
02:00:56,040 --> 02:00:57,840
when there was a problem in my life,

2288
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,240
atleast

2289
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:01,240
to hear me out

2290
02:01:01,480 --> 02:01:03,040
you could have stood by me.

2291
02:01:03,440 --> 02:01:05,680
On the other hand, 
you ignored me.

2292
02:01:08,520 --> 02:01:11,040
When you come to continue 
such a friendship,

2293
02:01:13,080 --> 02:01:15,080
how else should I react to you?

2294
02:01:18,320 --> 02:01:19,280
Anyway,

2295
02:01:20,760 --> 02:01:22,440
I don't want this friendship.

2296
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:23,800
Please!

2297
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:26,240
No need.

2298
02:01:27,160 --> 02:01:28,600
I don't want this friendship.

2299
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:30,720
I had a thought.

2300
02:01:30,800 --> 02:01:32,400
I am very different

2301
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:34,640
and intellectual as you used 
to tease me.

2302
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,520
But I understood that I am nothing 
like that.

2303
02:01:38,240 --> 02:01:39,880
Even after knowing you love me,

2304
02:01:39,960 --> 02:01:42,520
I was converting it as a friendship.

2305
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:44,320
Even this attire of mine.

2306
02:01:48,440 --> 02:01:49,520
No need for all that.

2307
02:01:49,600 --> 02:01:52,520
No use of this confession.

2308
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:00,800
If you can't understand 
the possessiveness of a girl

2309
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:03,240
towards a man, what kind of 
a lover are you?

2310
02:02:03,480 --> 02:02:04,520
Wasp!

2311
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:06,800
Hay!

2312
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:10,240
What?

2313
02:02:13,200 --> 02:02:14,000
How?

2314
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,400
Wasp!

2315
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,800
You!

2316
02:02:20,840 --> 02:02:26,440
"Seeing a flower bud passing by..."

2317
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:32,080
"There are some dreams in my heart."

2318
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:35,120
"In the song that can 
be heard in the air..."

2319
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:37,800
"Two parrots are coming together 
in a nest."

2320
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:44,200
"Let us do some sweet talks and 
laugh together."

2321
02:02:44,240 --> 02:02:47,080
"Slowly petal will bloom."

2322
02:02:47,120 --> 02:02:49,920
"Is it a rose flower?"

2323
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:55,280
"This love will develop in us."

2324
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:58,640
"Regularly it can be heard."

2325
02:02:58,680 --> 02:03:01,520
"Are they the spring music?"

2326
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:06,720
"Unknowingly your love will melt."

2327
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:09,600
"Closely in the soul..."

2328
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:15,400
"Thousands of sweet wishes will rise."

2329
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:18,200
"It is such a pleasure!"

2330
02:03:18,240 --> 02:03:21,080
"Sweet words will flow."

2331
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:24,080
"It'll spread happiness."

2332
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:29,680
"Two souls are bringing together 
desirable music."

2333
02:03:30,360 --> 02:03:32,960
"Slowly petal will bloom."

2334
02:03:33,240 --> 02:03:35,640
"Is it a rose flower?"

2335
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:41,640
"This love will develop in us."
