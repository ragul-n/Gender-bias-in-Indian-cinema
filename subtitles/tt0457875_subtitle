"Fraud, treachery!
Everywhere it's the same..."

"cities, villages,
all days, all nights"

5
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:09,314
"Everyone is weary"

00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,609
"Dialogues, meetings...
waste of time"

"Growing population, everywhere"

"confusion, exaggeration,

30
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,163
Shekhar Verma?

31
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:27,887
What's up, Colonel?

32
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,975
You took that flight

33
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,561
It's good to see you, Colonel

34
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,022
Move, everyone

35
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:39,274
Sit

36
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,910
It's been years. You still look
the same, years after I met you last

37
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,539
You haven't changed

38
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,750
Drink?

39
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:05,759
You really haven't changed, Colonel.
- Didn't feel the need

40
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:11,848
In fact... you haven't changed either

41
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,270
I didn't feel the need either

42
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,399
Where were you?

43
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,777
Wandering

44
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,572
How is Khanna?

45
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,075
Dead

46
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,999
Where?
- Punjab border

47
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,128
And Pady... Parmanand?

48
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,590
Kashmir. Machine gun

49
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:53,390
Damn. God bless them.
They were good men

50
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,278
Yes, Colonel?
- Sometimes I think...

51
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:13,159
God will never forgive us
for what we did

52
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,871
I have stopped thinking about it

53
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,125
That's right I guess

54
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,173
I think you made a mistake
by saving my life

55
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,760
You'd rather have let me die

56
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,436
Come on. I did the right thing

57
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,065
To be honest, I did it for myself,
not for you

58
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,655
For the sake of friendship. Remember
the first principle of friendship?

59
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,242
Be true to it,
or don't extend your hand

60
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,537
Your words

61
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,085
Baby, come on

62
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,343
Why did you call me?

63
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,847
What's the hurry, Colonel? We'll talk
in the morning. Now tell me...

64
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:25,106
These flat-nosed jerks!
They start early dawn

65
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:28,401
Welcome to Bangkok, Colonel

66
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,363
Excuse me, I'll be right back

67
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,956
Bro, no touching the girls

68
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,668
No touching the girls

69
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,304
You like to fight, eh?
- Okay

70
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,307
Outside

71
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,240
I thought you'd kill them

72
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:48,124
No, Colonel. I have stopped killing.
I'm out of the business of killing

73
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,607
What? Bodyguard? Me?

74
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,527
Are you in your senses?

75
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:19,656
I can't even take care of a corpse

76
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:23,284
No big deal.
All you got to do is...

77
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,371
hold a gun and stay with that family

78
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,708
Of late, it's fashion for the rich

79
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,588
Yes, but Shekhar you know that
I hate crowds

80
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,468
Then be the silent type, Colonel.
That's your style

81
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,389
But one thing I trust

82
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:46,891
What?

83
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:51,855
You will certainly save a corpse.
It's under no danger

84
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,775
Take it easy

85
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:59,362
Have you been watching the news?
It's all going downhill

86
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,908
What's going on in this city? It all
seems to be going out of control

87
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,329
Labor problems, raw materials
getting expensive...

88
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:12,959
and reducing bank balances.
We have to find another option

89
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:17,047
What about the London deal?
- The response is good

90
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,841
We'll have to go to London soon

91
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,928
Chang, where are your boys?

92
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:49,204
Gentleman... Colonel Suryaveer Singh,
the best

93
00:13:49,454 --> 00:13:53,041
Hello! How do you do?
- Mr. Ravi. His lawyer, Chang

94
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,673
Have a chat

95
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,351
Impressive.
Very impressive, Mr. Singh

96
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,312
Nepal, East Pakistan,
Sri Lanka

97
00:14:14,688 --> 00:14:19,275
Great record. So why do you
want to work for a paltry sum?

98
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,825
I got a problem, sir.
- What?

99
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,537
I booze.
- Even we do

100
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:35,208
How much do you drink?
- As much as my body takes

101
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:39,796
Does it affect work?

102
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:44,718
My hands tremble. Sometimes
the body doesn't respond to the mind

103
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:52,142
In which case, if someone tries
to kidnap me, what will you do?

104
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:56,563
Either he dies or me.
Nothing will happen to you

105
00:14:57,772 --> 00:15:01,359
I like that.
This drinking problem...

106
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,071
you don't need to tell my wife

107
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,199
Thank you, sir

108
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,380
Welcome, Mr. Singh

109
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,383
Nikasha

110
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,385
My wife

111
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,013
Meet Suryaveer Singh,
our new bodyguard

112
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,767
So glad to finally meet you.
- How do you do, ma'am?

113
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:22,607
Ravi spoke a lot about you. Besides,
it's always heartening to see an Indian

114
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:27,987
Would you like something?
- Scotch double. Straight up

115
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,489
Sure

116
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,330
Among the two, who do I stay with?

117
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,376
Didn't Ravi tell you?

118
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,130
Oh my God! You're gonna be in
for a big surprise

119
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,590
Anamika

120
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:07,193
Our life, our daughter...

121
00:17:07,861 --> 00:17:10,155
our most prized possession. Anamika

122
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,867
Anamika, this is Mr. Suryaveer Singh.
Your new bodyguard

123
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:16,369
Hello Surya

124
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,541
Suryaveer Singh is a long name

125
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,502
I will stick to Surya.
Is that okay?

126
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,840
I'm sorry, she can be
quite a brat sometimes

127
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:32,552
If you don't mind...
- No, no problem

128
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:37,599
I'll go and get my stuff

129
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:53,448
Thanks

130
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:01,373
What?
- Why didn't you tell me?

131
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:05,543
What? What happened?
- That I have to stay with a kid

132
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,921
No need to get worked up

133
00:18:08,129 --> 00:18:11,675
Crowd and kids... you know how I feel.
- Oh come on, Colonel

134
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:14,135
How'd a kid harm you?

135
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:22,644
Hardcore terrorists didn't scare you.
You are afraid of a little kid? Relax

136
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:26,356
It's gonna be fine. I promise.
- Yeah

137
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:35,657
I love you

138
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:47,002
This is your room,
with detached bathroom

139
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:50,714
This cabinet has
all the things you need

140
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:57,887
If you need something, please tell me.
- Thank you.

141
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:00,682
You also have
a music system and a TV

142
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:06,354
You can watch Discovery and
Cartoon Network. After work, that is

143
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,108
I'm so sorry about that

144
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,364
Please take some rest.
Dinner is served at nine

145
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,034
Thank you.
- Say good night to Surya

146
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,996
Good night, Surya.
See you tomorrow

147
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,874
Good night.
- Good night

148
00:19:46,978 --> 00:19:49,689
So how was your first meeting
with Surya?

149
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:55,653
He's very boring
and always tensed

150
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,493
How come?
- Can't you tell from his face...

151
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:06,289
that he is sad, worried
and tensed, Mummy?

152
00:20:07,624 --> 00:20:10,085
Mom, why is he sad?

153
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:15,924
I don't know. But I'll ask him
and tell you. Okay?

154
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:20,303
You are too mature for your age

155
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:24,641
Good night, Mom.
- Good night

156
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,978
Love you, Mom

157
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:40,490
Good night, bear.
Surya Bear

158
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,429
Okay. I think you should step out

159
00:21:47,349 --> 00:21:49,809
Hello, Mrs. Sharma.
- Hello, Anamika

160
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:53,438
Nice to see you back in school.
- Thank you, Mrs. Sharma

161
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:56,649
Meet my bodyguard Mr. Surya

162
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,611
Hello sir, how are you?
- How do you do, ma'am?

163
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:02,655
Well Anamika, you'll
get late for class

164
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:07,160
Bodyguard? May I say something
if you don't mind, sir?

165
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,582
Sure.
- I'm confident, you're honest at work

166
00:22:13,124 --> 00:22:15,794
But I pity you guys
for the work you do

167
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:20,799
I wish there was no need
for such a job in this world

168
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:27,555
I pity too. However, not
everyone's destiny is the same

169
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:32,977
In these times, it's rather imperative
for people like me to be born

170
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:36,564
Excuse me

171
00:23:09,848 --> 00:23:12,183
Hi. What's up?
- Hey, man

172
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,777
Indian?

173
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,536
Yo brother

174
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:35,832
Yo brother... from different mother

175
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:41,671
Over here, brother.
You are Indian, right?

176
00:23:42,047 --> 00:23:45,717
What do I look like?
- Looks hardly matter. I'm Indian too

177
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:49,179
But do I look like one?
Hang on

178
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,391
You have no idea, after a long time
I've met someone who understands Hindi

179
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:58,021
Kripa Shankar is the name, sir.
- Excuse me

180
00:23:58,355 --> 00:23:59,564
Wait

181
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,360
You can call me Krispi.
- Crisp?

182
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:10,075
Was born in India, but exported
to Bangkok in childhood

183
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:13,328
You have no idea how happy I am
to meet you

184
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,331
Anyway, tell me if I can help you

185
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,336
Help?
- Right. There's nothing here...

186
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:26,299
that I can't fetch you.
You are from India, I must serve you

187
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:30,053
Serve?
- Yes, sir. Food, booze...

188
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:34,683
heroin, opium... anything.
Just about anything

189
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:40,063
Here, you don't need a racket to
play table tennis. Hope you follow?

190
00:24:42,649 --> 00:24:47,153
Any famous liquor,
masseuse, girls... girls?

191
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:52,033
Mind-blowing! Who do you want?
American? Chinese? European?

192
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:56,955
You won't get a paradise like this!
Bangkok is sexy, sir

193
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:02,627
Thank you.
- Try my album, just once

194
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,088
Home delivery...

195
00:25:08,591 --> 00:25:10,093
Thank you

196
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,600
Good God!

197
00:25:25,191 --> 00:25:28,445
Where are you from, Surya?
- India

198
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:33,116
Come on! I know you are from India.
Do you think I'm stupid?

199
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,036
It's like Zhao saying
he's from Thailand

200
00:25:43,543 --> 00:25:45,920
What's wrong with your hand?

201
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:52,677
I was hurt when I was a kid.
- Don't lie. That's not a minor bruise

202
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:59,809
Surya, why are you always
tensed and sad?

203
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:05,565
Anamika, if you keep quiet,
I'll be able to drive carefully

204
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:08,401
Can't you chat and drive?

205
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:12,614
Bosco, my ex-bodyguard,
would talk to me while driving

206
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:15,408
Just try once

207
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:25,126
Just between you and me.
Bosco was a great friend of mine

208
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,422
Friends?

209
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,967
Surya, I say, friends?

210
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,806
Okay, I don't care

211
00:26:38,098 --> 00:26:40,600
But we'll certainly be friends...

212
00:26:41,101 --> 00:26:45,397
when you are in a good mood,
and when that tensed face...

213
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:51,820
Surya, learn to relax, man

214
00:26:56,533 --> 00:27:00,787
Now listen carefully.
I'm your bodyguard, just bodyguard

215
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:05,208
Not a friend to chat with you

216
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,629
I'm paid only to protect you.
You understand?

217
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:18,930
No need to cry.
- I'm not crying

218
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:40,493
You are right, you are only
my bodyguard. As of now, my chauffeur

219
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:43,455
Now get in and drive

220
00:28:42,222 --> 00:28:44,683
You are only my bodyguard

221
00:28:48,311 --> 00:28:50,772
Now get in and drive

222
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:11,584
Yes?

223
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:14,421
May I come in?

224
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:22,637
I wanted to talk to you

225
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:25,515
Please.
- No, I'm fine, thank you

226
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:31,771
Actually... it's about Anamika

227
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:37,610
Please go ahead.
- What I'm trying to say is...

228
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:40,697
please don't mind her words

229
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:46,453
She is stubborn, pampered...
our love has spoilt her

230
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:51,416
But she's not in the wrong,
it's our fault

231
00:29:52,751 --> 00:29:58,840
Our money, our success...
has snatched her childhood away

232
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:06,306
Ever since the rise in kidnappings,
we've confined her to the four walls

233
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,101
She has not one friend of her age

234
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:16,816
As friends, she has her parents,
servants, security guard... it's unfair

235
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,116
I have noticed that she is trying
to look for a friend in you

236
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:33,416
And as her mother, I request you
if you could... she is a child

237
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:37,796
You know how they are?
- No, I don't know how they are

238
00:30:40,173 --> 00:30:42,634
I just don't know how they are

239
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,976
Just one reason I came here for

240
00:30:53,228 --> 00:30:55,939
You needed a bodyguard
and I'm good at that

241
00:30:57,691 --> 00:31:03,196
If Anamika also needs a friend,
then you need to look elsewhere

242
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:10,537
I don't know how to make friends,
nor do I intend to

243
00:31:12,622 --> 00:31:15,583
I'm sorry.
- No. I'm sorry

244
00:31:17,627 --> 00:31:22,549
I was a fool to look for a friend
in a bodyguard for my daughter

245
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:25,885
But you know what?
You are right

246
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:30,890
You are just a bodyguard.
And I have no doubt that...

247
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:33,476
you will do your job perfectly

248
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:40,525
Sorry for wasting your time.
Good night, Mr. Singh

249
00:31:42,277 --> 00:31:44,738
And have a fantastic evening

250
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:14,267
God will never forgive us
for what we did

251
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,444
I can't even take care of a corpse

252
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:29,324
You'd rather have let me die

253
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:20,310
Come on

254
00:34:21,728 --> 00:34:23,188
Come on

255
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,002
No Colonel, not now

256
00:35:12,612 --> 00:35:14,489
What's up, Colonel?

257
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,117
Did I disturb you?

258
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,202
Not quite

259
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:30,046
Why does it happen that
when we trust someone...

260
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:37,178
he slips out of your hands
like sand?

261
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:45,103
Like...

262
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:50,400
this bullet

263
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:57,574
You forget, Colonel? It's nothing new.
It always happens with us

264
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:05,582
Some bullets took the swines,
while some went wasted. Remember?

265
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,586
Yes, I remember

266
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:17,177
I believe, every bullet
has a fate of its own

267
00:36:18,845 --> 00:36:25,477
When it finds its target,
it takes off. Hope you understand?

268
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:29,105
Maybe

269
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:35,028
I'm always right, Colonel.
I hope you are all right?

270
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:39,783
I'm okay... I'm okay

271
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:46,331
I'm sorry, I disturbed you

272
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:50,043
Get some sleep, go to bed

273
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:06,554
Hi Bebon.
- Hi

274
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:11,476
Zhao, mom and dad have gone out
for dinner

275
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:14,354
Help me out with these
questions please

276
00:39:16,147 --> 00:39:18,608
What is the capital of USA?

277
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:27,909
London

278
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:37,919
Who is the Prime Minister of India?
- India

279
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:48,054
Shah Rukh Khan.
- Yes!

280
00:39:57,022 --> 00:39:59,482
Thank you, Zhao. Good night

281
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:23,089
Good evening and welcome
to Crime Beat

282
00:40:23,923 --> 00:40:28,136
The police have arrested four men
connected with car thefts

283
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:33,850
Twenty-one cars have been recovered
totaling an estimated 600,000 USD

284
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:38,146
In another news, a six-year old boy
was kidnapped

285
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:44,444
Son of a wealthy businessman,
was returning home...

286
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:48,907
when six gunmen burst
onto the scene

287
00:42:16,578 --> 00:42:21,416
You swim well.
- No good. I always come third

288
00:42:53,948 --> 00:42:58,870
We're going to London for a few days.
I hope everything will be fine

289
00:42:59,537 --> 00:43:02,624
Don't worry, it's only a matter
of a few days

290
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,794
Thank you.
- Have a good trip

291
00:43:08,505 --> 00:43:10,632
Papa!
- Be a good girl

292
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,344
And don't go anywhere without Surya

293
00:43:15,387 --> 00:43:20,600
I trust, you'll take good care of her.
- I will. It's my job

294
00:43:21,434 --> 00:43:23,019
Thank you

295
00:43:30,193 --> 00:43:32,654
Bye.
- Bye baby

296
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:44,207
"For you, I breathe"

297
00:43:45,125 --> 00:43:48,128
"I love you"

298
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,342
"For you..."

299
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:57,595
"I'd even die"

300
00:43:58,513 --> 00:44:01,558
Surya, I have to win.
Coaching begins now?

301
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:23,246
You are scared of gunshots,
I noticed it the other day

302
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:27,167
You dived late.
- I'm scared of gunshots

303
00:44:28,501 --> 00:44:32,213
I don't know why.
- Okay. Now you repeat after me

304
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:36,384
I'm not scared of gunshots.
- I'm not scared of gunshots

305
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:39,012
Loud.
- I'm not scared of gunshots

306
00:44:39,304 --> 00:44:41,765
Louder.
- I'm not scared of gunshots

307
00:44:42,182 --> 00:44:44,684
Louder!
- I'm not scared of gunshots!

308
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:50,148
All right. Are you ready?
- Ready!

309
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:03,828
Oh my God!
- What?

310
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:09,501
Can you believe it?
The king of Patiala had hundred wives

311
00:45:10,251 --> 00:45:13,004
Papa has only one. Why?

312
00:45:18,593 --> 00:45:24,265
Ancient times. Those times
were different, not like the present

313
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:27,102
Poor king

314
00:45:28,061 --> 00:45:30,897
Why?
- Surya, imagine...

315
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:36,778
the plight of my father, if he had
hundred wives like mummy

316
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,202
No, seriously.
Multiply mummy by hundred

317
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:47,622
Life would've been hell
for everyone in the house

318
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:51,334
You smiled

319
00:45:51,626 --> 00:45:55,088
When?
- It's the first time I saw you smile

320
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:57,215
I didn't smile

321
00:45:57,674 --> 00:46:00,385
Really? So you don't know
how to smile

322
00:46:00,677 --> 00:46:02,387
No, I don't

323
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:06,349
Bet? I'll make you laugh

324
00:46:10,103 --> 00:46:12,939
Okay.
- Let's see who smiles first

325
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:22,615
You smiled! See, I won

326
00:46:25,994 --> 00:46:28,455
Good night, bear. Surya Bear

327
00:46:40,675 --> 00:46:44,262
"For you, I breathe"

328
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,808
"I love you"

329
00:46:50,352 --> 00:46:54,606
"For you..."

330
00:46:55,648 --> 00:46:58,193
"I'd even die"

331
00:47:12,665 --> 00:47:15,919
How many times will you fall?
- Sorry, sir

332
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:19,005
You?
- Yes... me

333
00:47:21,132 --> 00:47:23,968
I hope you don't have a gun.
- What are you doing here?

334
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:26,971
Home delivery. Stuff.
- What stuff?

335
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:32,102
Supplies. You can check, sir.
This is my card

336
00:47:35,689 --> 00:47:38,775
Come home sometimes.
Give me a chance to serve you, sir

337
00:47:39,275 --> 00:47:41,277
You will get anyone, by name...

338
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:48,785
Incense, candles...

339
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:55,583
Listen...
- Yes sir?

340
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:58,837
I want an air gun

341
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,852
"You are a celestial beauty..."

342
00:48:14,769 --> 00:48:18,815
"a marvel from the Maker"

343
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:22,819
"There's no one quite like you..."

344
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:30,118
"you have no idea"

345
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:03,777
No, I don't want.
- If you want to win the competition...

346
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:06,529
you will have to eat vegetables.
- Okay

347
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:10,116
Do I stand a chance, Surya?

348
00:49:10,533 --> 00:49:13,787
Why not? Just remember one thing

349
00:49:15,955 --> 00:49:21,711
Winners do what losers don't. Focus

350
00:49:31,554 --> 00:49:34,015
Do you have a girlfriend?

351
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:40,689
What?
- Tell me. You have or not?

352
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:43,274
Study History

353
00:49:43,608 --> 00:49:45,944
Exactly. Your history

354
00:49:49,364 --> 00:49:53,076
That is ancient history now

355
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,949
Don't forget

356
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:37,620
Winners do things that losers
don't do. Focus

357
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:40,999
And...
- I'm not scared of gunshots

358
00:50:41,499 --> 00:50:43,918
Good girl. Go, get them

359
00:50:44,961 --> 00:50:47,213
C'mon, get them

360
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:52,635
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, ma'am

361
00:50:53,428 --> 00:50:56,014
Glad to see you here.
What are her chances?

362
00:50:58,558 --> 00:51:01,936
She's going to win.
I wish her parents were here

363
00:51:02,812 --> 00:51:07,984
It doesn't matter. She has with her
the person she needs right now

364
00:51:08,526 --> 00:51:12,572
Today you are mother and father
to her. She will certainly win

365
00:51:12,906 --> 00:51:14,366
Excuse me

366
00:52:43,913 --> 00:52:47,000
And the winner is Anamika

367
00:52:50,837 --> 00:52:53,340
Surya, we did it! I won

368
00:52:53,923 --> 00:52:56,384
We did it! I won

369
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:28,458
That's my girl!
- I won!

370
00:53:28,958 --> 00:53:32,671
I'm so proud of you.
- Surya trained me

371
00:53:33,421 --> 00:53:36,424
I knew you could do it.
My daughter, after all

372
00:53:36,841 --> 00:53:40,053
Go and change, I'll be right there

373
00:53:44,808 --> 00:53:47,977
Thank you. You helped her...
- You are welcome

374
00:53:49,604 --> 00:53:52,065
She's an amazing child

375
00:53:54,484 --> 00:53:56,319
Excuse me

376
00:54:19,426 --> 00:54:20,844
Gorgeous

377
00:54:30,186 --> 00:54:33,273
Hey kid?
- Were you in the army with Surya?

378
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,944
Was he very brave?
- You really wanna know about Colonel

379
00:54:40,655 --> 00:54:42,615
So listen, sweetheart

380
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:49,748
There cannot be a brave
and honest army officer like him

381
00:54:51,458 --> 00:54:57,589
His stature, his discipline...
he made us all men

382
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:02,552
A great leader of men

383
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:05,555
Once on a mission...

384
00:55:53,937 --> 00:55:56,940
We thought we had accomplished
our mission

385
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:00,985
But suddenly the enemy attacked

386
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:06,074
In trying to save my life,
the colonel killed...

387
00:56:08,118 --> 00:56:10,328
two children, by mistake

388
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:15,583
The enemy took advantage of
the situation and took him hostage

389
00:56:17,627 --> 00:56:19,629
He was tortured for three days

390
00:56:22,215 --> 00:56:24,509
But the colonel...

391
00:56:24,884 --> 00:56:26,761
endured everything

392
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:32,600
In his shoes...

393
00:56:33,518 --> 00:56:35,979
I'd have died long ago

394
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:39,399
You know, Anamika,
you are a very lucky girl

395
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:45,488
You have the colonel for a friend

396
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,034
That's your colonel

397
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:51,953
Didn't you go to save him?

398
00:56:53,496 --> 00:56:56,332
If not for him,
I wouldn't be here today

399
00:56:58,918 --> 00:57:01,379
He took two hits
on his shoulders

400
00:57:05,175 --> 00:57:08,261
Still, he came
just to rescue me

401
00:57:09,804 --> 00:57:12,223
He killed all five of them

402
00:57:23,401 --> 00:57:25,862
I'm indebted to him

403
00:57:30,116 --> 00:57:33,828
My life is meant for you, friend.
- Thank you, Shekhar

404
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:40,460
What's this?
- To you, from your girlfriend

405
00:57:51,596 --> 00:57:55,058
He will protect you,
the way you protect me

406
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:14,494
Well deserved

407
00:58:32,679 --> 00:58:36,599
Surya, would it hurt
if I cut off my finger?

408
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:42,022
What?
- I can't learn piano without a finger

409
00:58:42,772 --> 00:58:45,859
I want to swim.
I don't want to learn piano

410
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:51,489
Come on. You are much tougher
than that

411
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:54,451
But I don't want to learn piano

412
00:58:55,201 --> 00:58:58,288
Do you know how to belch?
- What?

413
00:59:00,123 --> 00:59:03,501
Belch... burp. Do you know?

414
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:09,215
Like this?
- Louder

415
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:16,765
Let me show you

416
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:29,235
Surya, I'm talking about pianos,
and you are giving me lessons in burping

417
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:34,240
That's because... when you go
to the piano class...

418
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:40,914
burp loudly before
the teacher. And do it often

419
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:46,961
He'll throw you out
in a few days time. That simple

420
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:53,093
That's my girl

421
01:00:21,496 --> 01:00:23,957
Remember what I told you?
- Yes

422
01:00:31,798 --> 01:00:33,299
Hello.
- How long?

423
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:35,385
One hour

424
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:52,986
Anamika, please stop that

425
01:01:08,835 --> 01:01:11,546
He will protect you,
the way you protect me

426
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:18,173
That's the girl!
- Anamika! Run

427
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:15,725
Inspector, what can you tell us
about the kidnapping?

428
01:06:16,393 --> 01:06:20,814
Well, this time it is Mr. Ravi Rathore,
the famous businessman from India...

429
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:24,150
whose daughter has been kidnapped.
- This is the fifth kidnapping...

430
01:06:24,401 --> 01:06:27,153
from an Indian family.
What can you tell us about that?

431
01:06:27,654 --> 01:06:30,115
We're trying. The kidnappers
are very smart

432
01:06:30,323 --> 01:06:34,369
But they will not get very far.
We'll catch them soon. Excuse me

433
01:07:18,538 --> 01:07:22,959
Ravi, I know it's your daughter.
We'll get Anamika back soon

434
01:07:24,878 --> 01:07:28,173
Everything will be all right,
trust me

435
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,085
Welcome back

436
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:09,255
Welcome back.
- Good morning, sir

437
01:08:19,432 --> 01:08:21,893
Bullet, from your shoulder

438
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:31,361
Second, back

439
01:08:31,861 --> 01:08:34,322
Third, near the heart

440
01:08:40,245 --> 01:08:42,872
So what's the score, colonel?

441
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:47,585
Anamika?

442
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:03,101
Mr. Ravi Rathore?
- Over there, sir

443
01:09:07,647 --> 01:09:12,569
Mr. Rathore... my friend

444
01:09:13,903 --> 01:09:17,615
I'm Harry, from the
anti-kidnapping Branch

445
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:22,037
Your daughter has been kidnapped...
I can understand

446
01:09:22,787 --> 01:09:26,332
I have a daughter too.
If she gets a little out of sight...

447
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,086
We can handle it, thank you.
We don't need your help

448
01:09:30,587 --> 01:09:35,091
Here's a letter from the office of
the District Attorney. You can read it

449
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:38,470
You can even talk to him

450
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:43,850
Mr. Rathore, this is my case

451
01:09:44,476 --> 01:09:50,940
I'll bring your daughter back, but
I need your help to nab the kidnapper

452
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,170
Hello?

453
01:10:20,970 --> 01:10:23,431
D'you love your daughter?
- Yes

454
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:27,602
Yes, we love her very much.
- That's what I thought

455
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:32,565
Good. Everything will be fine then

456
01:10:35,151 --> 01:10:37,987
Now listen, and listen good

457
01:10:38,279 --> 01:10:40,740
What do you want?

458
01:10:41,616 --> 01:10:47,580
Just one million USD

459
01:10:48,915 --> 01:10:53,294
Do you think your little angel
is worth a million?

460
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:58,008
She is priceless.
Anamika is priceless

461
01:11:00,176 --> 01:11:05,306
Lovely. That's what I wanted to know

462
01:11:05,765 --> 01:11:09,269
And yes, get this little thing clear

463
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:15,025
In this sacred relationship
between you and me...

464
01:11:15,692 --> 01:11:20,697
the police has no room. Right?

465
01:11:21,656 --> 01:11:22,949
Else...

466
01:11:24,284 --> 01:11:28,121
else, it'll be a crowd.
I hate crowds

467
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:33,793
Is that loud and clear?
- Yes, that's clear

468
01:11:34,419 --> 01:11:36,296
My brother

469
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:13,416
Brother, I hope my million is ready?

470
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:16,336
Yes, it's ready

471
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:19,506
Delicious

472
01:12:20,507 --> 01:12:22,884
Now listen very carefully

473
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:27,806
Your daughter is happy
and healthy

474
01:12:28,473 --> 01:12:31,976
If our plan succeeds...

475
01:12:33,019 --> 01:12:38,900
she will come back home smiling,
in one piece

476
01:12:39,693 --> 01:12:43,780
However, if there is
any deviation...

477
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:48,827
I hope you understand, my brother?

478
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:55,041
Yes, I get it. Don't worry,
there won't be any problems

479
01:12:55,542 --> 01:12:58,003
Now that's my boy

480
01:13:00,547 --> 01:13:05,552
Listen to me carefully.
The money should be divided...

481
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:10,056
into two duffle bags.
Half-million each

482
01:13:11,391 --> 01:13:15,478
Then get it to your Range Rover.
Zhao will drive

483
01:13:17,897 --> 01:13:22,986
Tell him to drive with the bags
straight to Democracy Circle

484
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:27,157
He will drive around the circle
two times

485
01:13:29,325 --> 01:13:34,039
Ravi, you will take
your shirt off and wave...

486
01:13:35,165 --> 01:13:37,542
for me to identify you

487
01:13:40,086 --> 01:13:43,798
There's a phone booth
on the left hand side

488
01:13:44,215 --> 01:13:47,510
The phone will ring... pick it up

489
01:13:48,428 --> 01:13:50,889
And follow the instructions

490
01:13:52,807 --> 01:13:56,686
There's a map in the booth. Read

491
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:07,530
And go straight to the location.
Got it?

492
01:14:10,658 --> 01:14:15,580
You will find a white car
with an open boot

493
01:14:25,965 --> 01:14:29,135
Put the bags inside

494
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:33,848
And return to your car

495
01:14:35,141 --> 01:14:37,977
Don't look behind

496
01:14:38,895 --> 01:14:42,065
Don't damn look back

497
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:48,154
You are under arrest!

498
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:51,950
Fire!
No!

499
01:14:58,957 --> 01:15:00,500
No!

500
01:15:02,419 --> 01:15:07,007
I'm a professional!
If you keep your word, I'll keep mine

501
01:15:07,674 --> 01:15:09,259
I promise

502
01:15:15,181 --> 01:15:16,766
Stand by

503
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:20,145
Hello?
- Well Mr. Rathore...

504
01:15:21,438 --> 01:15:23,898
don't you understand Hindi?

505
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:28,903
Are you deaf? Or are you
just playing dumb?

506
01:15:30,196 --> 01:15:33,908
I told you not to bring the cops

507
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:37,704
I told you, I warned you, brother

508
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:43,001
You killed my brother!

509
01:15:44,794 --> 01:15:47,255
You think I'm gonna ever forget that?

510
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:49,549
Ever?

511
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:52,135
Not again

512
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:56,931
Forget your little angel

513
01:15:58,141 --> 01:16:00,143
Hello, sir?

514
01:16:00,935 --> 01:16:04,314
I'm Anamika's mother, sir

515
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:08,109
It wasn't our mistake, sir.
We didn't call the police

516
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:13,406
I swear by Anamika!
Please give us another chance

517
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:17,619
Please don't harm, Anamika

518
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:22,582
Sorry, lady

519
01:16:23,917 --> 01:16:25,293
Sorry

520
01:16:26,169 --> 01:16:28,630
I should've dealt with you earlier

521
01:16:31,007 --> 01:16:33,218
Talk to your baby

522
01:16:33,968 --> 01:16:37,013
Talk to your baby.
- Sir... hello?

523
01:16:37,681 --> 01:16:39,265
Hello, Mama?

524
01:16:41,559 --> 01:16:44,270
Mama, I'm scared

525
01:16:44,688 --> 01:16:48,441
Nothing will happen to you.
Papa will fix things

526
01:16:51,027 --> 01:16:55,657
Now you can kiss
your little angel goodbye

527
01:17:16,094 --> 01:17:19,431
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
for your daughter

528
01:17:20,223 --> 01:17:24,519
I tried my best, but...

529
01:17:26,396 --> 01:17:31,317
I'm sorry, I...
- You bastard!

530
01:17:31,651 --> 01:17:33,945
Get out! Get out of my house

531
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,574
Get out of my house, all of you

532
01:17:38,533 --> 01:17:40,994
Just get out of my house

533
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,870
What happened?

534
01:18:29,042 --> 01:18:33,963
Colonel... Anamika...

535
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:37,133
What's wrong, Shekhar?

536
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:44,557
The money didn't get to them.
I don't know what went wrong

537
01:18:45,558 --> 01:18:50,063
The kidnapper's brother was killed.
In retaliation...

538
01:18:53,900 --> 01:18:56,361
they have killed Anamika, Colonel

539
01:18:59,447 --> 01:19:03,827
"For you, I breathe"

540
01:19:05,578 --> 01:19:09,374
"I love you so dearly"

541
01:19:11,418 --> 01:19:16,339
I'm so sorry

542
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:21,845
"I live for you..."

543
01:19:30,520 --> 01:19:33,023
Sergeant Kelly. Bangkok police.
- Shekhar here

544
01:19:33,398 --> 01:19:35,775
How's he doing?

545
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:38,028
Not good

546
01:19:41,448 --> 01:19:44,576
I'm sorry for your loss.
It must be hard on you

547
01:19:46,953 --> 01:19:50,874
I know you're still not very well,
but formalities have to be completed

548
01:19:52,751 --> 01:19:55,795
Was any of these men
there at the time?

549
01:20:38,129 --> 01:20:41,549
No, none of them.
- Do you recall anything else?

550
01:20:43,510 --> 01:20:44,719
No

551
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:51,351
Keep it. If you happen to recall
anything more...

552
01:20:51,726 --> 01:20:55,105
you'll find my details in there.
Call me anytime

553
01:20:56,439 --> 01:20:58,358
Thank you, sir

554
01:20:59,192 --> 01:21:01,361
I'll see them off, Colonel

555
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:09,411
Excuse me, sir... excuse me!
- Yes?

556
01:21:11,371 --> 01:21:13,248
I have something to ask you

557
01:21:13,873 --> 01:21:16,835
Please don't mind... but can
the Colonel go back home?

558
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:20,922
Are you going to charge him with
something? Is he a suspect?

559
01:21:21,756 --> 01:21:24,592
Of course not.
- Thank you

560
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:37,981
What's going on, Colonel?

561
01:21:38,523 --> 01:21:40,817
Take me to the place where
the shootout took place

562
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:43,403
No way, Colonel.
The state you're in right now...

563
01:21:44,029 --> 01:21:46,656
Shekhar... please?

564
01:23:28,925 --> 01:23:30,760
You're okay, sir?

565
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:34,389
It all happened because of me.
- What?
