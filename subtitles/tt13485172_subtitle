1
00:01:58,339 --> 00:02:00,053
Hey, Gaali Sampath...

2
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,935
[speaking gibberish] 
-Hey, stop man!

3
00:02:04,044 --> 00:02:06,537
Hey! I will kill you!

4
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,790
Stop politely.

5
00:02:09,554 --> 00:02:10,610
Hey!

6
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:17,434
GALI SAMPATH

7
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:24,654
VEERA BHADRAM DRAMA COMPANY

8
00:02:25,037 --> 00:02:29,297
Veera Bhadram drama company 
presents 'Gondru Bebbuli'.

9
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,596
In another five minutes.

10
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:34,215
Well, is Pankajam going to 
remove her saree or not?

11
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:37,659
Not Pankajam. 
It is Draupadi.

12
00:02:37,859 --> 00:02:40,285
It's called the 'Stripping of Draupadi'.

13
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,310
Whatever! 
Is she going to remove her saree or not?

14
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,640
First, let's get this done. 
You can watch that later.

15
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,897
Since I paid 200 bucks, 
she would obviously remove it.

16
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,620
Power police Inspector Ranjith Kumar!

17
00:02:49,979 --> 00:02:54,299
He is going to entertain 
you with his dialogues.

18
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:56,669
Applause! 
[applause]

19
00:02:56,869 --> 00:02:58,441
Come on! Whistles! 
[whistling]

20
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:00,097
I'm a relative to the law, even with 
relatives I maintain law. (Practicing)

21
00:03:00,172 --> 00:03:01,605
Damn it! 
Law is my relative.

22
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:03,393
I am a related to the law... 
Damn it!

23
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:04,237
The law...

24
00:03:05,327 --> 00:03:06,047
What's next?

25
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,053
Relative!

26
00:03:07,373 --> 00:03:08,264
No! No! 
The law!

27
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:09,274
Sir, it's relative!

28
00:03:09,474 --> 00:03:11,376
Since, you are related to MP Sir... 
I let you join our company.

29
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,541
I praised you to the 
seven skies out there.

30
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:15,774
Try to do a good job with 
this character, at least.

31
00:03:15,974 --> 00:03:17,412
Of course! 
Watch me mesmerize on the stage.

32
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:18,834
You want me to watch this mess?!

33
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:20,565
Pull you pants up and wear a belt!

34
00:03:20,765 --> 00:03:23,959
No use... 
Our company needs a powerful performer.

35
00:03:36,085 --> 00:03:37,055
Veeru, what's the meaning of this?!

36
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,404
You said you would give me the 
auction money and gave it to them instead.

37
00:03:39,604 --> 00:03:41,630
If you do that again, 
I will not give you money.

38
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,011
Dushasana has to tug at my saree.

39
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:45,643
If you are up to any cheap 
tricks, I will skin you!

40
00:03:46,172 --> 00:03:46,807
Idiot!

41
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:49,289
Well, is Veerabhadram here?

42
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:51,090
Unless it's 12 o'clock in the 
night, he doesn't come to me.

43
00:03:51,991 --> 00:03:53,339
Tell him! Go ahead and tell him!

44
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,909
Tell him when I come to 
you and how long I stay, etc.

45
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,031
Give him my entire schedule!

46
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,238
Veerabhadram?

47
00:03:57,438 --> 00:03:58,439
Pankajam?

48
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,092
Didn't we decide not to tell 
people about our live-in relationship?

49
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:07,548
Sorry, Bhadram.

50
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:10,507
Young man, what I said earlier 
was all a lie. In jest.

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,540
You said everything there 
was to say and you called it a lie?

52
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,767
Tell me?

53
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:17,963
-Sir... 
-Ah?

54
00:04:18,163 --> 00:04:20,346
In a short while from now, the play 
'Gondru Bobbili' is going to start, right?

55
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:20,822
Yes.

56
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:23,528
If you give the role of 
SI Ranjith to my boss...

57
00:04:23,948 --> 00:04:25,528
...he will set the stage on fire!

58
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:28,935
Is it?

59
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,167
He will leave the audience spell bound!

60
00:04:33,248 --> 00:04:35,650
Law and justice... righteousness...

61
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:37,564
From justice to righteousness... it's law.

62
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:38,353
it's law.

63
00:04:39,381 --> 00:04:40,743
Really? 
Would he really go such a good job?

64
00:04:40,943 --> 00:04:42,086
You can witness it with your own eyes.

65
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:44,143
He is going to blow people away!

66
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:45,995
Well... show me... blow me away!

67
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:47,628
Boss, let's start.

68
00:04:56,799 --> 00:04:59,202
Fu..fa.. faf... 
[speaking gibberish]

69
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:03,717
Oh my God! Fu..fa.. faf...?

70
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:04,620
What does it means?

71
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,405
-Rutherford! 
-God!

72
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:07,591
Oh? Is that so?

73
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,473
-(speaks gibberish) 
-I will become the wind in the wind...

74
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:12,937
-(speaks gibberish) 
-Water in water,

75
00:05:13,137 --> 00:05:15,624
-[speaks gibberish] 
-Mud in the mud,

76
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:17,335
-[speaks gibberish] 
-[shouts]

77
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:20,016
-[speaks gibberish] 
-Not there.

78
00:05:20,282 --> 00:05:22,425
-[speaks gibberish] 
-Shoot me here!

79
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:23,902
-[speaks gibberish] 
-Shoot me!

80
00:05:24,102 --> 00:05:25,615
-[speaks gibberish] 
-Shoot me!

81
00:05:26,982 --> 00:05:28,729
-Come here. 
-Sir?

82
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,911
You kept saying he is going to blow 
me away? Is this what you meant?

83
00:05:31,816 --> 00:05:35,144
Instead of speaking, why is his 
mouth blowing air like an Usha fan?

84
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:38,679
Few years ago, my boss met with an 
accident and damaged his vocal cords.

85
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,901
Ever since then, when he 
speaks, all he can do is blow wind.

86
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,098
That is why everyone 
calls his 'Gaali' Sampath.

87
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:46,774
Why would you say it so proudly 
like he was Swami Vivekananda?

88
00:05:47,302 --> 00:05:49,153
You mean to say, 
he will act like Rajasekhar

89
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:50,453
and you would become 
his voice like Sai Kumar?

90
00:05:50,758 --> 00:05:52,587
-[speaks gibberish] 
-What does it mean?

91
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:53,383
Would be repeated exactly.

92
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,192
I don't want this pair of you.

93
00:05:55,392 --> 00:05:56,062
[speaks gibberish]

94
00:05:56,876 --> 00:05:57,344
What do you mean?

95
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:58,305
I will go.

96
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:01,879
Ah? Please, please. Just once chance.

97
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:02,877
-[speaks gibberish] 
-Please.

98
00:06:03,077 --> 00:06:03,827
Alright! Alright! Alright!

99
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:08,205
Since you are so persuasive, I'll give you 
a role that would add to your portfolio.

100
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:09,693
-[speaks gibberish] 
-Super!

101
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,461
Those two rows at the 
back are feeling stuffy

102
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:14,953
-because there is no circulation there. 
-[speaks gibberish]

103
00:06:15,153 --> 00:06:15,560
So...?

104
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,218
Take him and make his stand there.

105
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,859
He will just keep blowing people away! At 
least then, people wouldn't feel stuffy.

106
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,176
-Hey, girl! 
-Ah!

107
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:30,820
Finally, is Pankajam going 
to remove her saree or not?

108
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,270
No, she is not going to remove her saree.

109
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,954
I paid 200 rupees for the ticket.

110
00:06:35,154 --> 00:06:37,105
Let's see how you will cross the 
village boundary if that doesn't happen.

111
00:06:37,305 --> 00:06:38,257
Are you threatening me?

112
00:06:38,457 --> 00:06:39,404
Yes, of course.

113
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:43,044
We got drunk just to watch her undress.

114
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:55,727
[speaks gibberish]

115
00:06:56,438 --> 00:06:57,180
Windy guy?

116
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,279
Gosh! 
What is this Sampath fellow doing here?

117
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:05,709
Sania Mirza watched Mirzapur 
web series in Amazon Prime.

118
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,494
The British and Portuguese attacked RRR.

119
00:07:12,158 --> 00:07:13,519
What's with this whole 
blowing air business?!

120
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:15,752
-[speaks gibberish] 
-I will thrash you!

121
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,512
[speaks gibberish]

122
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:19,252
We tried something new. 
Just shut up and watch!

123
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,469
Why are you scolding the audience?

124
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,476
Pradeep Rawat and Kangana 
Ranaut meets in the city of parrots.

125
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,387
[speaks gibberish]

126
00:07:28,587 --> 00:07:30,443
Instead of watching like goats...

127
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:33,185
...couldn't you applaud?

128
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:34,909
-[speaks gibberish] 
-Come on! Applaud!

129
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:37,756
Why wouldn't we applaud? 
We will applaud hard.

130
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,302
Gosh! Instead of applauding, 
why are you hitting us with stones?!

131
00:07:42,854 --> 00:07:45,605
Oh no! Oh my God! 
Don't hit me I'll beg you.

132
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:56,165
Is the play over?

133
00:07:57,953 --> 00:08:00,328
I wanted Pankajam to undress. 
Why did you undress instead?

134
00:08:06,366 --> 00:08:07,779
You... Gaali Sampath!

135
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:17,896
Brother, two cups of tea please.

136
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,339
Do you think ghat road 
is like a gravel road?

137
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:21,905
Do you think you can 
drive however it pleases you?

138
00:08:22,105 --> 00:08:22,731
Here, take it.

139
00:08:25,136 --> 00:08:25,953
If we had started early in the morning,

140
00:08:26,153 --> 00:08:28,038
we could have driven on 
safe roads and been on time.

141
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:29,732
If we went there on time, we would 
only get the money we are owned.

142
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:30,720
If we reach there an hour early,

143
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,414
we can make 20% extra in 
commission from the merchant.

144
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,843
We are going to be 
driving on unsafe roads.

145
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:35,343
We shall make the trip in an hour, uncle.

146
00:08:35,437 --> 00:08:36,739
What? The entire trip in 
an hour on unsafe roads?

147
00:08:37,828 --> 00:08:39,267
Uncle, at least you should 
have a bit of trust in me.

148
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:41,424
Even I don't trust you.

149
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:42,215
Who the hell are you?

150
00:08:42,415 --> 00:08:43,285
Agent.

151
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:44,730
LIC.

152
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,447
Why would you make it sound 
important like an FBI agent?

153
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:47,158
We are not interested.

154
00:08:47,789 --> 00:08:51,230
How could you just leave 
when I am talking to you?

155
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,357
What's your problem?

156
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:53,478
I will bet you 5000 bucks.

157
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:55,155
You will not reach your 
destination in an hour on these roads.

158
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:56,918
Uncle, those 5000 bucks are yours.

159
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:57,738
Load it up! Load it up!

160
00:08:58,108 --> 00:08:59,285
There is a lot of stuff in the back 
and there is no place in the front.

161
00:08:59,485 --> 00:09:00,013
Where do you sit?

162
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:01,465
If that's the case, 
I will squeeze in between the both of you.

163
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:02,758
Really? Then, let's take a selfie.

164
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:03,580
Why?

165
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,083
To compare after ride and before ride.

166
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:08,566
Did you know that you are 
not visible in your selfie?

167
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:10,941
You seem the pestering sorts. By the end 
of the trip, you should be all sorted.

168
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:11,653
Come on!

169
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:31,143
Oh my god! Oh my god! 
Stop it! Stop it!

170
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:35,622
Cute boy.

171
00:09:38,577 --> 00:09:39,962
You are doing a good job 
hanging about like Spiderman.

172
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:40,837
We shall reach in an hour.

173
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:45,642
Please, tell him to stop.

174
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,635
Now? Shall we take a selfie now? 
Maybe you can see me now.

175
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,555
-I beg you. 
-No.

176
00:09:57,626 --> 00:09:59,287
Look like you take it very seriously.

177
00:10:13,022 --> 00:10:15,208
Goodness! Such a loud mouth!

178
00:10:15,547 --> 00:10:16,205
Sorry, fella!

179
00:10:16,405 --> 00:10:18,731
I said in an hour but you slipped 
into work a minute before us.

180
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:20,518
Oh, my goodness! Enough with you.

181
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,968
Are you going to pay through 
Phonepay or Googlepay?

182
00:10:22,168 --> 00:10:24,433
My wallet is on the backside, take it.

183
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:30,907
You seem very tired. Was the journey long?

184
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:32,057
Very long.

185
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:34,377
We crossed the holy 
mountain and went as far as hell.

186
00:10:34,577 --> 00:10:35,002
Is that so?

187
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:37,230
If you had told me you were 
driving all the way to hell,

188
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,190
I would have sent a bottle of liquor 
to my grandfather who sits in hell.

189
00:10:40,134 --> 00:10:41,329
If you get into his vehicle once,

190
00:10:41,661 --> 00:10:42,946
you could even join your 
grandfather for a drink.

191
00:10:43,302 --> 00:10:44,905
-What nonsense! 
-Oh really?!

192
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,671
Why were you late in delivering the goods?

193
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,605
The workers were late and so, there 
was a delay in loading up the vehicle.

194
00:10:55,805 --> 00:10:58,749
If you give me such shitty excuses, 
I will kill you!

195
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:00,184
Get lost!

196
00:11:01,028 --> 00:11:04,176
Merchant, you must give me twenty percent 
more than what you pay me every day.

197
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,379
We unloaded the goods an hour 
earlier than the appointed time.

198
00:11:06,579 --> 00:11:07,099
What say you, uncle?

199
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:07,768
That is true.

200
00:11:08,053 --> 00:11:11,438
Your entire shenanigans 
were uploaded onto YouTube!

201
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,175
Oh goodness! We got caught!

202
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,222
What the hell! 
I wonder who uploaded it onto YouTube.

203
00:11:15,422 --> 00:11:21,232
Details of your rash driving are caught... 
caught entirely caught on this video.

204
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:23,135
Brother...

205
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:28,163
Merchant, you cut a lot from 
what you pay me every day.

206
00:11:28,363 --> 00:11:32,317
I will be the one to pay for 
accidents for your unsafe driving.

207
00:11:32,714 --> 00:11:35,062
If someone takes a risk, they are usually 
rewarded. Why would you penalize me?

208
00:11:35,389 --> 00:11:38,778
This is how business must be conducted.

209
00:11:38,978 --> 00:11:39,433
Go on.

210
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:40,597
Go about your business.

211
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,349
Here, uncle. Your 5000 bucks.

212
00:11:44,313 --> 00:11:47,452
If he keeps cutting away at my wages, 
when will I buy a truck of my own?

213
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,958
Only god can cure your bad luck.

214
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:54,042
We called for just one. 
How come there are a lot of them here?

215
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:57,637
Gods, 
have you come here to shower me in riches?

216
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:01,379
We came here to take away your money.

217
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:03,374
Why?

218
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:06,026
It's because of the mess your father made.

219
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,383
Father!

220
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,142
Nephew, your money.

221
00:12:15,274 --> 00:12:16,641
There are ten thousand rupees here, 
where is the other five thousand?

222
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:17,868
My uncle has them.

223
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:20,330
Uncle, even your money...

224

225
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:22,834
Hey!

226
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,942
Is Pankajam going to undress here or not?

227
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,946
What a prick! 
Won't you go home?

228
00:12:28,146 --> 00:12:29,979
-We would, if she undresses. 
-Disgusting.

What?

239
00:13:14,695 --> 00:13:15,695
You want me to sing 
with a lot more clarity?

240
00:13:16,216 --> 00:13:17,042
I can't do justice to 
Telugu songs in the first place

241
00:13:17,242 --> 00:13:18,440
and you want me to translate Hindi songs?

242
00:13:20,241 --> 00:13:21,619
What? You want to sing Urdu songs as well?

243
00:13:22,278 --> 00:13:23,381
Since there is no one 
around to stop you...

244
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:24,857
Here. Here he comes.

245
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:27,212
They are just getting 
rowdier by the day, uncle.

246
00:13:27,412 --> 00:13:30,880
Looking at him all angry, I think he 
got wind of the SI Ranjith Kumar affair.

247
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,418
Why don't you let it go this time?

248
00:13:34,618 --> 00:13:35,321
Let it go?!

249
00:13:36,808 --> 00:13:37,338
I did nothing.

250
00:13:37,438 --> 00:13:38,881
I am just a translator. 
Give respect to me.

251
00:13:38,932 --> 00:13:39,385
Where is dad?

252
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:40,954
He ran to the kitchen.

253
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,578
Father, did you ever notice this?

254
00:13:44,678 --> 00:13:45,159
What is it?

255
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:47,381
You are in the company of the son, 
whereas I am in the company of his father.

256
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:49,951
We are both assistants. 
It's a crazy combination.

257
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:51,899
How do you feel?

258
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:52,937
Idiot!

259

Got it!

260
00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:56,300
Father, do you have any sense?

261
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,899
You went and ruined their play.

262
00:13:58,099 --> 00:13:59,307
They came to me and 
demanded I pay for their loss.

263
00:13:59,676 --> 00:14:02,661
My boss pays me only half of what is 
owned to me and those fellows took it way.

264
00:14:02,861 --> 00:14:04,281
How are we going to 
survive this entire month?

265
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,445
Dad, 
you aren't able to speak any single word.

266
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,555
Do you need acting?

267
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:11,878
Do you think you are a Rajinikanth?

268
00:14:13,013 --> 00:14:13,451
Of course!

269
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:14,725
Or do you think of 
yourself as Amitabh Bhachchan?

270
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,424
Why not?

271
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,216

Do you think we are infants...

00:17:03,532 --> 00:17:05,343
...that we would just crawl 
up there and fall into it?

Do you think only 
infants will fall into that?

00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,170
A notification for a local 
drama competition is up.

345
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,786
Veera Bhadram's team's been selected.

346
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:49,187
So, please stop your shenanigans.

347
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:50,994
Get into Veera Bhadram's good 
books and be a part of his play.

348
00:19:51,194 --> 00:19:52,192
Do you know how much 
the prize money's worth?

349
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,094
8 lakhs.

350
00:19:55,607 --> 00:19:58,632
If you win it, you can fulfil 
your desire to be part of movies.

351
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,386
[speaks gibberish]

352
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,054
So, what if you can't speak?

353
00:20:03,387 --> 00:20:06,972
One can emote without speaking a 
single word and truly create miracles.

354
00:20:07,328 --> 00:20:08,619
Think of something new like that.

355
00:20:10,421 --> 00:20:11,274
I know you can do it.

356
00:20:11,749 --> 00:20:14,207
Even if people believe you or 
don't, I believe you can do it.

357
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:21,677
Kamala, your eldest sister is Vimala. 
(Dialogue practising)

358
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:23,141
Vimala, your elder sister Kamala...

359
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:24,810
Kamala, your eldest sister is Vimala.

360
00:20:25,109 --> 00:20:26,328
Vimala... your sister....

361
00:20:26,528 --> 00:20:27,605
Why do you always keep 
trying to recollect...

362
00:20:27,805 --> 00:20:29,999
your dialogues like you lost 
something and are trying to find it?

363
00:20:30,613 --> 00:20:31,924
Well, the town's cultural 
committee gave us a pass...

364
00:20:32,024 --> 00:20:33,109
because they believe we 
would put on a splendid show.

365
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:33,986
This wouldn't do!

366
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:37,006
We need a powerful 
performer if are to win the prize.

367
00:20:39,023 --> 00:20:39,965
Veerabhadram!

368
00:20:44,956 --> 00:20:45,857
Why did you come here again?

369
00:20:46,057 --> 00:20:47,983
(speaks gibberish)

370
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,972
-Meaning? 
-We need your slot.

371
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:53,303
Well, the thing is, you have earned 
a slot in the town's drama competition.

372
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:54,670
If you could give that slot to my boss...

373
00:20:56,252 --> 00:20:57,391
-He will do... 
-I know...

374
00:20:57,846 --> 00:20:59,637
Giving a marvellous performance..?

375
00:21:00,795 --> 00:21:01,984
A splendid job and win the cup.

376
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:04,387
Kamala, your eldest sister Vimala...

377
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,129
This damn sister!

378
00:21:06,424 --> 00:21:07,358
Vimala, your eldest sister Vimala...

379
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:08,780
I am certain this guy will make us fail.

380
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,330
I will lose the cup and take the loss 
of transportation costs as well.

381
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:12,747
Okay.

382
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,391
You can take the slot and 
you can win the cup as well.

383
00:21:17,955 --> 00:21:18,728
Oh really?

384
00:21:20,048 --> 00:21:20,855
That's amazing!

385
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,711
The prize money is eight lakhs.

386
00:21:22,911 --> 00:21:24,425
So, you must pay me five 
lakhs in advance for the slot.

387
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:27,658
Five lakhs?

388
00:21:29,209 --> 00:21:30,195
When do we need to pay it?

389
00:21:30,395 --> 00:21:31,803
Even if you pay me a day before 
the competition, that would suffice.

390
00:21:32,003 --> 00:21:33,433
Take your own time.

391
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:34,642
Dear...

392
00:21:34,842 --> 00:21:36,384
Honey, send me twenty 
thousand bucks into my account.

393
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:37,567
Remove that hand!

394
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:39,482
Even Veerabhadram doesn't 
dare lay his hand on me during the day.

395
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:42,547
This isn't my necklace.

396
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:45,202
Are they ask you that I 
do not come day time..?

397
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,007
Why don't you tell them 
about my health conditions?

398
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,264
Is Pankajam going to undress or not?

399
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:54,212
Goodness! You followed us to our village?

400
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:55,565
If Pankajam is going to undress,

401
00:21:55,765 --> 00:21:58,580
I will follow her to any village, 
any district or any state.

402
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:00,423
I will punch you. Get lost!

403
00:22:00,841 --> 00:22:02,341
The engine is in very good condition.

404
00:22:02,541 --> 00:22:04,472
It's got very few miles on it. 
It's a very good bargain.

405
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:05,231
The vehicle is awesome!

406
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,533
If you could give me a month, I will 
arrange for money and get back to you.

407
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:09,307
Sorry, brother.

408
00:22:09,507 --> 00:22:11,106
This vehicle has a lot 
of demand in the market.

409
00:22:11,306 --> 00:22:12,439
One month is too long.

410
00:22:12,726 --> 00:22:13,754
Why don't you arrange 
for the money in ten days?

411
00:22:18,193 --> 00:22:19,103
Here are the vegetables, lady.

412
00:22:19,765 --> 00:22:20,829
Everything here is fresh.

413
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,521
Thank you so much, young man.

414
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,970
Could you please talk to your husband 
and help with my loan?

415
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,378
Manager, Hari Babu.

416
00:22:38,247 --> 00:22:38,960
Idly...

417
00:22:39,818 --> 00:22:40,824
Chutney...

418
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:44,017
this is... spiced chilli powder...

419
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:45,381
Ghee... 
serve it! Serve it! Serve it!

420
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,266
Here, it is... Ghee.

421
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:51,331
If you served me breakfast 
with such love and care...

422
00:22:51,531 --> 00:22:52,911
I am sure you planned something...

423
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:53,550
Tell me.

424
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,361
Our young man here needs a loan approved.

425
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,903
Both our sons are in the US.

426
00:22:58,103 --> 00:22:59,324
This young man is not our son!

427
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:01,265
He is a truck driver in the village.

428
00:23:01,465 --> 00:23:04,607
If both our sons are far away in the US, 
who is going to look after us here?

429
00:23:04,807 --> 00:23:05,523
Isn't he the one?

430
00:23:06,077 --> 00:23:06,613
Mummy...

431
00:23:07,402 --> 00:23:09,034
Don't let him get close to us.

432
00:23:09,323 --> 00:23:12,655
Tomorrow, if he gets bags of vegetables 
and begins to call us his parents...

433
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:14,257
we might have to give 
him a share of our wealth!

434
00:23:14,457 --> 00:23:15,392
I didn't think of this, sir.

435
00:23:15,789 --> 00:23:17,260
You mean if you thought of it, 
you would ask for a share?

436
00:23:18,129 --> 00:23:19,699
Go and get something 
that can stand as guarantee.

437
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,062
To give a loan, there are some rules 
and procedures to be followed.

438
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,649
I will go and get you 
something as a guarantee.

439
00:23:23,849 --> 00:23:25,094
Yes, go and see to that!

440
00:23:25,776 --> 00:23:27,883
I will get you lady's fingers tomorrow.

441
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:29,300
Yes, dear. Get tender ones.

442
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,207
Alright, lady. I shall take my leave.

443
00:23:30,387 --> 00:23:31,118
Sure, son. Take care.

444
00:23:31,318 --> 00:23:31,894
Okay.

445
00:23:32,094 --> 00:23:32,580
Mummy!

446
00:23:33,798 --> 00:23:35,457
Please, 
try not to get too attached to him.

447
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,033
I will try.

448
00:23:39,389 --> 00:23:41,436
I told you that the deadline to recharge 
the phone with 99 rupees was yesterday.

449
00:23:41,536 --> 00:23:42,234
Why didn't you do it?

450
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:43,548
I did it in the night, uncle.

451
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:44,769
Which night was that?

452
00:23:45,134 --> 00:23:46,894
9848252143

453
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,252
It looks you are going to falling in love.

454
00:23:49,452 --> 00:23:51,262
My number ends with 142. 
Not 143?

455
00:23:52,554 --> 00:23:53,866
Well, whose number could it be?

456
00:24:11,273 --> 00:24:13,112
Tell me boys, what is the problem?

457
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,211
Little lady, 
he stole my goat and cooked curry it.

458
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:17,138
I want the curry. That's all.

459
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,340
A pity. He does make sense. 
Why don't you give him the curry?

460
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,209
The goat is of course his.

461
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,050
But the food that the goat ate, 
I mean the grass it had for food...

462
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,088
was from my property.

463
00:24:24,513 --> 00:24:25,755
So, the grass is mine and 
its food is mine as well.

464
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:27,058
Hence, the meat is mine as well.

465
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:27,720
That's true.

466
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,592
Why don't you give it to him, then?

467
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,351
Madam, make him hand over the meat.

468
00:24:31,365 --> 00:24:33,253
The goat grew fat on the 
grass from my property.

469
00:24:33,453 --> 00:24:34,823
Madam, the goat is mine.

470
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,128
Why are they cutting the call?

471
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:51,408
The goat is mine! 
-The meat is mine!

472
00:24:51,608 --> 00:24:54,374
Get lost! What nonsense are you talking? 
-Go and complain to whomever you wish.

473
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:55,636
Oh! Father?!

474
00:24:58,498 --> 00:24:59,722
-What's going on? 
-Dad...

475
00:24:59,922 --> 00:25:01,164
Instead of going to the temple, 
why are you here mediating this dispute?

476
00:25:01,393 --> 00:25:03,086
I just wanted to lighten 
your burden when you returned.

477
00:25:03,286 --> 00:25:04,462
-Where is your mother? 
-There!

478
00:25:05,101 --> 00:25:08,133
(singing song) Such long flowy 
hair, Such a beautiful plait.

479
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,334
These things are to be done at home. 
Why would you do this here in the office?

480
00:25:11,534 --> 00:25:13,461
A women's beauty is in her braid.

481
00:25:13,661 --> 00:25:15,299
Does that mean you are going to braid 
the hair of everyone in the village?

482
00:25:15,842 --> 00:25:17,904
As soon as she sees hair, 
she rushes to braid it.

483
00:25:18,104 --> 00:25:18,977
Stop that.

484
00:25:19,177 --> 00:25:22,915
(singing) Such long flowy hair, 
Such a beautiful plait.

485
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:27,953
Sarpanch Sir, 
please make him hand over the meat.

486
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:29,987
That goat ate the grass from my property.

487
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:32,134
The grass of mine and so, 
the meat is also mine. Isn't that so?

488
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:33,886
As the village chief, 
I am giving you my judgement.

489
00:25:34,351 --> 00:25:36,130
The meat is to be split into 
equal halves between the both of you.

490
00:25:37,542 --> 00:25:38,390
What rubbish is this?!

491
00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:40,005
Split it into two halves?

492
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:40,766
What's remaining of this, here?

493
00:25:40,966 --> 00:25:42,021
Little lady ate a kilo of meat.

494
00:25:42,221 --> 00:25:43,055
And you come to the office late...

495
00:25:43,155 --> 00:25:44,018
...and declare that we split it into 
equal halves amongst us!

496
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:47,323
Hey... Hey...

497
00:25:47,565 --> 00:25:49,680
At least take these bones 
away and feed them to the dogs.

498
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:51,561
We are of the opinion that...

499
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,943
you would do a better job of 
feeding on it than a dog would.

500
00:25:54,876 --> 00:25:55,868
Did they praise me or criticize me?

501
00:25:56,068 --> 00:25:57,118
Comparing one to a dog 
is obviously criticism.

502
00:26:02,737 --> 00:26:03,762
Hello? 
Who are you?

503
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,389
She picked the call. 
Some girl, I suppose.

504
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:06,637
Who are you?

505
00:26:06,837 --> 00:26:08,716
I will squeeze into the phone 
and hit you on the other side!

506
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,339
How dare you ask me who 
I am when you are the one who called me?

507
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:12,844
My 99 rupees were accidentally 
transferred into your Phone Pay account.

508
00:26:13,044 --> 00:26:13,902
That is why I called.

509
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:14,828
Do you know who I am?

510
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:16,167
Why would I care about who you are?

511
00:26:16,612 --> 00:26:17,696
Please return my 99 rupees back.

512
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,851
This arrogant prick!

513
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:21,961
Come to the Gandhi 
statue at Sakhinetipalli.

514
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:22,934
I will return your money there.

515
00:26:23,615 --> 00:26:24,981
Uncle, she is asking us to meet her.

516
00:26:25,181 --> 00:26:26,342
She must be really 
flat because of my tone.

517
00:26:26,442 --> 00:26:27,267
You are super!

518
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:29,799
Friend...

519
00:26:30,008 --> 00:26:32,337
There she goes in that auto. 
She is one I am in love with.

520
00:26:37,008 --> 00:26:39,346
Buddy, 
help me get her to fall in love with me.

521
00:26:40,401 --> 00:26:41,079
How would it benefit us?

522
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:42,820
How would it benefit me?

523
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,638
Veerabadram asked for 5 lakhs...

524
00:26:43,738 --> 00:26:44,698
to participate in the District 
Drama competition, right?

525
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,234
I will give you that 5 lakhs.

526
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:47,281
I will hit you with that kind of money.

527
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:49,111
I will hit you with my boot...

528
00:26:49,311 --> 00:26:49,802
What do you mean?

529
00:26:51,565 --> 00:26:52,654
If you fall short of that 
money by even a rupee.

530
00:26:52,854 --> 00:26:54,548
If needed, I will pay you 50,000 in extra.

531
00:26:55,437 --> 00:26:56,184
Oh really?

532
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:57,973
Super!

533
00:27:05,266 --> 00:27:07,097
-Get down, little lady. 
-Why? What happened?

534
00:27:07,473 --> 00:27:08,000
Just get down!

535
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:13,513
Apparently, you ate a kilo of mutton 
at the District administrative office.

536
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,191
And now, you are ate these bananas.

537
00:27:15,391 --> 00:27:16,551
Is that stomach of 
yours a bottomless lake?

538
00:27:17,843 --> 00:27:18,583
Stop!

539
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:19,293
Stop!

540
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:20,713
Stop! Stop!

541
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:22,412
Instead of just following my 
father around like a buffalo,

542
00:27:22,612 --> 00:27:24,036
-why doesn't he find some work? 
-Stop! Stop!

543
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:25,045
Hey...

544
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:26,099
Hello, stop... stop.

545
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:27,971
Hello, I need a lift to the center.

546
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:30,643
Buffalos are usually loaded up behind.

547
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:31,754
Why would you load them in the front?

548
00:27:32,041 --> 00:27:33,497
Nephew, she called me a buffalo.

549
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:35,795
Let it go, uncle. 
She is a girl. So, go easy.

550
00:27:35,995 --> 00:27:37,077
Get down! Get down!

551
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:38,694
Wait... I am getting down.

552
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,119
When did you get on?

553
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,176
A while ago... he stopped the vehicle 
at the road end. That is when I got on.

554
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:50,882
Well, what's going on with you?

555
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:53,486
Just like a seatbelt on flight, 
you have a hand belt sort of contraption?

556
00:27:53,687 --> 00:27:55,821
The other day you asked us to take a bottle 
of liquor to your grandfather in hell, right?

557
00:27:56,088 --> 00:27:56,488
Yes, I did.

558
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,751
Today, you can deliver it yourself!

559
00:27:57,951 --> 00:28:00,374
Enough! I don't scare that easily.

560
00:28:00,728 --> 00:28:01,655
You are going way too slow.

561
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:03,135
Was your previous vehicle a bullock cart?

562
00:28:04,346 --> 00:28:06,209
Why would you act all 
haughty like you paid for the ride?

563
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:07,114
Payment?

564
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:15,813
Would you call this driving?

565
00:28:16,013 --> 00:28:17,487
You mean, this isn't how one drives?

566
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:19,098
Nope.

567
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:19,890
Oh?

568
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,530
Oh my god!

569
00:28:33,582 --> 00:28:34,802
Tell him to stop!

570
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:38,623
Grandfather!

571
00:28:38,823 --> 00:28:39,981
Did you finally see your grandfather?

572
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:44,447
Tell him to stop! 
Hey! Hey! Hey!

573
00:28:45,073 --> 00:28:46,100
Grandfather!

574
00:28:46,723 --> 00:28:48,513
Didn't I tell you that he will 
fly this thing on the road?

575
00:28:48,648 --> 00:28:50,001
Stop! No! no!

576
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,411
Grandfather!

577
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,114
Would you call this driving?

578
00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:05,338
Did you finally see your grandfather?

579
00:29:05,538 --> 00:29:06,178
Grandfather...!

580
00:29:06,593 --> 00:29:07,927
Did you give him a bottle of alcohol?

581
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:09,695
Looks like I need it more than anyone.

582
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:29,588
Hey, you! 
Are you following me?

583
00:29:30,216 --> 00:29:31,437
What do you mean I am following you?

584
00:29:31,637 --> 00:29:32,959
I came here for another girl.

585
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:34,076
For a girl?

586
00:29:34,276 --> 00:29:37,889
A girl received 99 
rupees of mine by accident.

587
00:29:38,089 --> 00:29:39,847
She said that she would return the 
money here. That is why I came here.

588
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,916
Oh my goodness! So, it's you!

589
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:42,878
Wait, I am going to teach you a lesson!

590
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:45,480
The girl is just going 
to return your money.

591
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,910
Why are you blushing?

592
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,099
Why wouldn't I? It's my 99 rupees.

593
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,386
She could have returned 
that money back to me...

594
00:29:50,586 --> 00:29:51,502
on the very same app that 
she received the money from.

595
00:29:51,938 --> 00:29:53,810
Instead, 
she asked me to meet her directly.

596
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:58,571
It's because she liked my voice 
and it could mean something more.

597
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:00,554
Why are you showing off then?

598
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:03,176
I don't think you would understand 
the body language of couples in love.

599
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:06,987
Why does it say that 
her phone's switched off?

600
00:30:10,057 --> 00:30:11,142
Switched off, again?

601
00:30:12,236 --> 00:30:13,131
Why is her phone switched off?

602
00:30:13,331 --> 00:30:14,646
Why would you ask me?! 
Do you think she is my sister?!

603
00:30:15,305 --> 00:30:16,173
Oh, dear!

604
00:30:16,373 --> 00:30:18,221
Alright, I came here on work.

605
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,415
What work do you have here?

606
00:30:20,373 --> 00:30:21,435
Tell me, why did you come?

607
00:30:21,635 --> 00:30:23,119
-Why because... 
-Tell me, why did you come?

608
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:24,157
Well, I'll tell you.

609
00:30:24,605 --> 00:30:25,434
Little lady...

610
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:27,141
you are not the one to make 
yourself visible in this neighborhood.

611
00:30:27,341 --> 00:30:28,269
What brings you to this village?

612
00:30:28,469 --> 00:30:29,359
Tell me, what work do you have here?

613
00:30:29,846 --> 00:30:30,511
I'll tell you.

614
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:33,441
It's Gandhiji's birthday today.

615
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:35,304
Happy birthday Gandhiji!

616
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:36,850
Happy birthday Gandhiji!

617
00:30:36,897 --> 00:30:38,168
There is a statute of 
Gandhiji in your village as well.

618
00:30:40,103 --> 00:30:41,789
Yes, there is. Isn't there? 
Tell me, what brings you here.

619
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:43,114
-That's true. What work do you have here? 
-That's such perfect logic..?

620
00:30:43,893 --> 00:30:45,896
Last Thursday, you went to 
Saibaba Temple in your village, right?

621
00:30:45,897 --> 00:30:46,297
Yes!

622
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,599
And then, you came to the 
temple in our village, right?

623
00:30:47,699 --> 00:30:48,099
Yes, I did.

624
00:30:48,327 --> 00:30:50,498
Then... right then... 
what happened to your perfect logic then?

625
00:30:50,698 --> 00:30:51,639
Wish Gandhiji on his birthday!

626
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:52,664
-Happy birthday Gandhiji! 
-Come on! Say it!

627
00:30:53,263 --> 00:30:54,053
Come on! Say it!

628
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:55,608
-Happy birthday Gandhiji! 
-Happy birthday Gandhiji!

629
00:30:55,814 --> 00:30:57,226
Oh, my goodness! 
She is really snooty!

630
00:30:59,964 --> 00:31:00,541
Go...

631
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:01,920
Go...

632
00:31:04,517 --> 00:31:06,095
What's going on? 
Why is he scolding the rain?

633
00:31:07,186 --> 00:31:09,007
That's just how it is. 
He doesn't like the rain.

634
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,879
He must be the only person 
in this world who doesn't enjoy the rain.

635
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:14,139
What is the problem?

636
00:31:15,509 --> 00:31:16,445
That is the problem.

637
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:20,577
Do you think it's a goat or a bird 
that you can just shoo it away?

638
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:21,325
It's a cloud.

639
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:23,481
It does what it's 
supposed to and then leaves.

640
00:31:24,088 --> 00:31:28,067
(speaks gibberish)

641
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:29,295
What? You don't want a 
single drop of rain to fall down?!

642
00:31:29,495 --> 00:31:30,935
If that's case, 
cover your house with an umbrella!

643
00:31:34,732 --> 00:31:36,703
Go away! Get lost rain!

644
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:38,543
-Go away! 
-Go away!

645
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:40,375
Get out from my boss house.

646
00:31:42,529 --> 00:31:43,584
-Hello? 
-Hello.

647
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,181
You said you would meet 
me at the Gandhi statue.

648
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:45,713
What happened? Why didn't you come?

649
00:31:46,046 --> 00:31:46,536
I came there.

650
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:47,552
You did? Where?

651
00:31:47,832 --> 00:31:50,771
There was a girl clad in half 
saree looking like a jackal!

652
00:31:51,099 --> 00:31:52,136
You were busy with her!

653
00:31:52,336 --> 00:31:54,308
What do you mean a jackal? 
She looks extraordinarily pretty!

654
00:31:55,017 --> 00:31:55,857
Is that so?

655
00:31:56,057 --> 00:31:58,457
Then, collect those 99 rupees from her.

656
00:31:58,741 --> 00:32:01,345
No! No! She doesn't just look like a 
jackal. She also looks like an owl!

657
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:03,650
She ate a kilo of mutton, that glutton!

658
00:32:03,936 --> 00:32:04,954
People of the village 
have a lot to say about her.

659
00:32:05,154 --> 00:32:05,640
Stop that!

660
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:07,671
She is a girl. 
You must give her some respect.

661
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:08,772
Alright.

662
00:32:09,915 --> 00:32:12,423
The weather is quite nice.

663
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:14,886
Do you want to go for a ride?

664
00:32:16,297 --> 00:32:18,058
We can go for a drive and 
settle what's owed to each other.

665
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:19,178
Settle what's owed? 
Okay, come.

666
00:32:19,491 --> 00:32:20,995
Come to the water pump in 
the village head's field.

667
00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:23,416
The water pump?

668
00:32:24,078 --> 00:32:25,153
What a romantic place!

669
00:32:31,739 --> 00:32:33,609
(Speaks gibberish)

670
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,268
It went away! Went away! Went away!

671
00:32:37,762 --> 00:32:39,426
The rain's gone! It's gone! It's gone!

672
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,103
Buddy, now that the rain's gone,

673
00:32:41,454 --> 00:32:42,961
please suggest me an idea to 
make that girl fall in love with me

674
00:32:43,366 --> 00:32:45,656
(Speaks gibberish)

675
00:32:45,856 --> 00:32:46,320
Thank you.

676
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:48,039
What do you think he said?

677
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:50,448
-What do you think he said? 
-Well..

678
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:51,252
I didn't get it.

679
00:32:51,452 --> 00:32:53,312
Then, why did you thank him?

680
00:32:53,832 --> 00:32:54,581
He is my boss.

681
00:32:55,065 --> 00:32:56,223
I am the translator!

682
00:32:56,619 --> 00:32:58,641
-Give respect to me 
-Alright, fine. Translate it.

683
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:00,034
I will.

684
00:33:00,432 --> 00:33:02,020
-I will do it now. 
-Thank you.

685
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:10,051
What?

686
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:17,064
For a love story to be successful...

687
00:33:18,881 --> 00:33:20,195
...a love letter is important.

688
00:33:20,741 --> 00:33:21,533
Sounds lame!

689
00:33:22,231 --> 00:33:23,509
Even if you hit me, it still sounds lame.

690
00:33:23,842 --> 00:33:24,443
Here is the pen.

691
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:26,572
Not with a pen?

692
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:27,741
Then, what do you write the letter with?

693
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:29,512
Veg puff or egg puff?

694
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:33,112
With blood?

695
00:33:33,326 --> 00:33:34,219
This sounds even lame!

696
00:33:38,682 --> 00:33:40,493
The great actress Savitri...

697
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,179
...a very old story...

698
00:33:44,751 --> 00:33:45,687
...it was a blockbuster movie.

699
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:46,766
I get it.

700
00:33:46,966 --> 00:33:48,354
Old is gold and it was 
a national award winner.

701
00:33:48,554 --> 00:33:49,584
Okay, go ahead and give your blood.

702
00:33:49,784 --> 00:33:51,023
What?! My blood?

703
00:33:51,355 --> 00:33:52,891
I will pay you ten thousand bucks if 
either one of you uses your blood.

704
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:53,588
Ten thousand?

705
00:33:53,904 --> 00:33:54,829
Okay, then. Take my blood.

706
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:57,536
Take it!

707
00:33:57,817 --> 00:33:58,487
Take it!

708
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:01,233
Blood Pressure... Sugar...

709
00:34:01,256 --> 00:34:01,689
So what?!

710
00:34:01,814 --> 00:34:02,974
Do you consider yourself to be a 
great writer like Rama jogaiah Shastri

711
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:03,900
or Seeta Rama Shastri...

712
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,908
to be filling up pages 
and pages with philosophy?

713
00:34:06,185 --> 00:34:07,838
You would use a little...

714
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:11,339
of my blood to confess in a sentence 
or two or perhaps an 'I love you'.

715
00:34:14,492 --> 00:34:15,492
If you lose your blood...

716
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:16,728
So what?

717
00:34:16,948 --> 00:34:18,280
If I have an energy drink, the production 
of blood in my body will be amped up.

718
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,644
But, the money... ten grand!

719
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:21,442
What are you waiting for? 
Just suck my blood out!

720
00:34:22,968 --> 00:34:24,128
Oh really?

721
00:34:25,625 --> 00:34:26,476
Such a heroic act!

722
00:34:32,082 --> 00:34:32,931
What's the girl's name?

723
00:34:33,262 --> 00:34:35,626
Alivelu Mangatayaru... 
Lakshmi Sowbhagyavati

724
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,490
Roja Ramani... Madhavi Lata...

725
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:39,405
Kasturi Kalpana Rajeswari.

726
00:34:39,798 --> 00:34:41,206
In short, she is called 'Baby'.

727
00:34:41,406 --> 00:34:42,069
It's better to address her as Baby.

728
00:34:42,269 --> 00:34:43,204
Baby is certainly better.

729
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:46,491
Enough with wasting time. 
Come on hurry!

730
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:47,203
Oh no!

731
00:34:48,514 --> 00:34:49,620
...Maha Rajasri...

732
00:34:51,226 --> 00:34:52,162
The revered...

733
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:54,695
honorable...

734
00:34:55,585 --> 00:34:58,401
Are you writing the letter 
to the girl or her father?!

735
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,809
He interrupted me. Tear the paper.

736
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:06,708
-...Maha Rajasri... 
-Again..?

737
00:35:07,846 --> 00:35:08,834
The revered...

738
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,778
(speaks gibberish)

739
00:35:11,978 --> 00:35:12,457
blood!

740
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:15,995
My heartfelt devotion...

741
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:17,458
...my gratitude..

742
00:35:18,005 --> 00:35:18,588
...my heartfelt...

743
00:35:19,257 --> 00:35:20,735
When will you address Baby?!

744
00:35:21,194 --> 00:35:22,672
When will you address Baby?!

745
00:35:25,898 --> 00:35:28,148
He interrupted me again. 
Tear it!

746
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:31,227
-...Maha Rajasri... 
-Again?!

747
00:35:39,755 --> 00:35:41,664
To Baby, with love.

748
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:44,353
Is he alive or dead?

749
00:35:46,385 --> 00:35:46,891
He is alive.

750
00:35:56,192 --> 00:35:57,736
Why is she coming this way?!

751
00:36:06,308 --> 00:36:09,162
The weather's changed suddenly 
and the rain stopped... so...

752
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:12,380
What's going on?! Why are you parking 
yourself here at our water pump?

753
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,271
Are you following me?

754
00:36:13,471 --> 00:36:15,329
That girl who owes me 99 rupees asked 
me to come here. That is why I am here.

755
00:36:15,686 --> 00:36:16,792
Oh, the very first time you are going to 
meet her is at such a naughty place, huh?

756
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:18,356
Gosh, no! She was the one 
who suggested this place!

757
00:36:18,556 --> 00:36:20,438
-What are you going to do when she comes? 
-I am going to ask her for my money.

758
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:21,653
After that?

759
00:36:22,426 --> 00:36:24,178
If she looks good, 
I am going to flirt with her and then,

760
00:36:24,378 --> 00:36:24,983
fall in love with each other.

761
00:36:25,368 --> 00:36:27,265
-What next after you fall in love? 
-We will get married.

762
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:28,316
What after marriage?

763
00:36:28,592 --> 00:36:31,269
Little lady, I don't know if your question 
is innocent or are you being deliberate.

764
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:34,443
What could happen after marriage? 
We will consummate our marriage.

765
00:36:36,198 --> 00:36:37,649
After that we will 
have two or three children

766
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:39,429
and live happily for 
the rest of our lives.

767
00:36:39,629 --> 00:36:41,619
Happy? 
You are just a truck driver.

768
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:45,590
Suppose that girl is some rich man's 
daughter, How can she stay happy with you?

769
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:47,024
Little lady, 
I thought you were just crazy.

770
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,252
You do seem to have a brain.

771
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,401
That is a very good question.

772
00:36:49,601 --> 00:36:50,812
Come with me. I'll explain.

773
00:36:52,116 --> 00:36:54,197
Every girl misses out on 
this little piece of logic.

774
00:36:54,489 --> 00:36:57,107
Every girl wants to get married to 
a rich man or a guy settled abroad.

775
00:36:57,842 --> 00:37:00,328
What can a rich man give? 
Of course, he can only give her money.

776
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:02,189
Where will he give 
her the time of the day?

777
00:37:03,883 --> 00:37:04,661
If she demands it,

778
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:08,030
she might be given a 
bungalow or a car or some gold.

779
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,032
When will he give her his time?

780
00:37:09,967 --> 00:37:12,957
Even goddess Lakshmi is a woman. 
She is a competitor for husband's time.

781
00:37:14,953 --> 00:37:16,852
If it was some working-class man like me,

782
00:37:17,248 --> 00:37:20,274
I would get out in the morning 
at 9 am in a truck or an auto

783
00:37:20,554 --> 00:37:22,649
and return home sharp at 5 o'clock.

784
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:26,569
I would get her flowers while I return 
home, eat what my wife would cook for me,

785
00:37:26,925 --> 00:37:28,370
go for a late-night movie,

786
00:37:28,728 --> 00:37:32,853
imagine myself as the hero in that movie 
and my wife as the heroine in that movie,

787
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,863
slip into a small fantasy,

788
00:37:35,263 --> 00:37:38,115
return home and talk for a 
bit and sleep peacefully.

789
00:37:38,479 --> 00:37:39,552
Isn't a good life?

790
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:42,342
See, there are absolutely no tensions. 
Only time.

791
00:37:44,086 --> 00:37:46,003
Living together does not 
mean living in the same house.

792
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:49,136
It means spending time with each 
other and creating great moments.

793
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,410
Isn't that time?

794
00:37:51,023 --> 00:37:52,693
In my opinion, rich men do not have it.

795
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,453
But in my case, I have a lot of time.

796
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,196
I don't know which girl is 
going to be married to me.

797
00:38:01,396 --> 00:38:03,832
But I am sure, I am going to 
give her great many memories.

798
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,188
Baby is coming, boss.

799
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,261
(speaks gibberish) 
-All the best.

800
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:28,869
Thank you.

801
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,220
"Looks like I am flying in the air"

802
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,975
Lord Hanuman, 
this is my first time driving the vehicle.

803
00:38:46,506 --> 00:38:48,458
Please protect me and make 
sure there are no accidents.

804
00:38:50,185 --> 00:38:51,598
No, I am going to watch you.

805
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:56,948
I bought the idol for 50 rupees. 
You must take care of me.

806
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,805
I am your fan.

807
00:38:59,187 --> 00:39:00,574
Oh, dear! 
What kind of twisted devotion is this?!

808
00:39:04,431 --> 00:39:05,989
Lord Hanuman, 
why would you push me into a pothole?

809
00:39:06,189 --> 00:39:07,060
When did I do that?

810
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:08,335
Why do you constantly fight with me?!

811
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:09,447
I told you that I won't 
keep my eyes on the road.

812
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,126
Just as Lord Rama resides in your 
heart, You reside within mine too.

813
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:13,262
Do you want me to 
take it out and show you?

814
00:39:13,332 --> 00:39:14,256
Please keep your eyes on the road. Please.

815
00:39:15,537 --> 00:39:17,917
Watch out! Someone's coming!

816
00:39:20,641 --> 00:39:25,335
(singing gibberish) 
"Looks like I am flying in the air."

817
00:39:29,258 --> 00:39:30,631
I lost the letter.

818
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:43,250
-No! No! Baby is better. 
-Just give it! It doesn't matter.

819
00:39:45,393 --> 00:39:47,441
You want me to back your 
loan with my collateral,

820
00:39:47,641 --> 00:39:48,474
and then, 
you become the owner of the vehicle

821
00:39:48,674 --> 00:39:50,243
and then, I end up working for you?

822
00:39:50,633 --> 00:39:53,073
Who else is going to help me merchant, 
if not you? Please, merchant.

823
00:39:53,448 --> 00:39:54,278
Alright, fine.

824
00:39:54,712 --> 00:39:57,820
Go and buy a new truck 
but there is a condition.

825
00:39:58,092 --> 00:40:01,490
Four days a week carry whatever you 
want in your truck and earn for yourself.

826
00:40:01,842 --> 00:40:03,633
But for the next three years,

827
00:40:04,016 --> 00:40:07,350
three days a week, you must work 
your truck for me, free of cost.

828
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,232
Nephew, for three years?

829
00:40:09,889 --> 00:40:12,633
We would be in tune for loss of up to 10 
to 15 lakhs if we count 3 lakhs per annum.

830
00:40:13,352 --> 00:40:14,199
Is that yes or no?

831
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:16,274
It's my marriage anniversary. 
My woman is waiting for me.

832
00:40:16,964 --> 00:40:17,898
You must call her your wife, sir.

833
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:19,802
Yes, wife. She is waiting.

834
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,226
Okay, merchant. I will meet you tomorrow 
with the papers. I shall take my leave.

835
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,551
Give it some more thought, nephew.

836
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,421
Enough with those antics, 
your wife is waiting for you.

837
00:40:27,621 --> 00:40:28,086
Ha..?

838
00:40:28,286 --> 00:40:29,066
I mean the lady of the house.

839
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:36,193
If you perform like this,

840
00:40:36,553 --> 00:40:38,514
you are sure to win the 
District Drama Competition.

841
00:40:41,411 --> 00:40:42,319
Let's have some good coffee.

842
00:40:43,558 --> 00:40:44,424
Hello, sir.

843
00:40:45,363 --> 00:40:47,025
My wife wants to go to 
Rajamundry. Give me a ticket.

844
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:49,522
What time is it now? 
And did you come straight to my house?

845
00:40:49,856 --> 00:40:51,331
-It's quite urgent. 
-okay

846
00:40:51,675 --> 00:40:53,686
Mr. Sampath, you seem to be in 
very good spirits. What's up?

847
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:58,304
-(speaks gibberish) 
-I am going to win the Competition...

848
00:40:59,239 --> 00:40:59,941
...and then...

849
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:04,180
my son is going to own a truck!

850
00:41:04,492 --> 00:41:06,453
Your son asked my boss for a guarantee.

851
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:08,416
And my boss put in an 
unfair condition that your son

852
00:41:08,609 --> 00:41:10,674
would work for him for free for three 
days a week, for the next three years.

853
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:12,578
What good comes of owning a vehicle 
with that condition? He is a Slave

854
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,657
I am going to drink his blood.

855
00:41:21,642 --> 00:41:23,670
Buddy, instead of going there 
to fight it out with him,

856
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,827
-give a call first. 
-Okay

857
00:41:34,553 --> 00:41:36,719
Get the oil ready.

858
00:41:39,116 --> 00:41:41,673
(speaks gibberish) 
Is that wheat flour?

859
00:41:41,936 --> 00:41:42,486
Who the hell are you?

860
00:41:45,265 --> 00:41:48,207
(speaks gibberish) 
Your adulterous lover.

861
00:41:48,494 --> 00:41:51,418
Bloody Sampath! 
Why did you come here at this hour?

862
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:55,861
Now, we are going to hear a 
song from 'Kondaveeti Raju'...

863
00:42:16,615 --> 00:42:18,449
Instead of dancing, 
can't you go and stop them?

864
00:42:18,625 --> 00:42:20,390
It's not my job. 
I am just a translator.

865
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:33,512
How dare you make my son a slave?

866
00:42:34,834 --> 00:42:35,578
Three years of...

867
00:42:36,037 --> 00:42:39,657
-for free... 
-Please don't hit him.

868
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,340
working for you...?

869
00:42:44,237 --> 00:42:45,682
I will put an end to this!

870
00:42:48,174 --> 00:42:48,706
Husband!

871
00:42:52,247 --> 00:42:54,133
You dare go and complain to 
your father, and get me hurt?

872
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,566
You wanted collateral, right?!

873
00:42:56,766 --> 00:42:57,588
Now, I give you that.

874
00:42:57,798 --> 00:42:59,831
I will make sure that your 
father is banished from this village

875
00:43:00,031 --> 00:43:01,734
and even this earth!

876
00:43:02,425 --> 00:43:03,588
That is my collateral!

877
00:43:04,766 --> 00:43:05,233
Get lost!

878
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:05,979
Husband...

879
00:43:07,962 --> 00:43:09,079
Yeah, right! 
Like that threat's going to work.

880
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:14,342
What is your problem, father?

881
00:43:15,164 --> 00:43:16,700
I begged the merchant to provide me with 
collateral for a loan and finally got it.

882
00:43:17,022 --> 00:43:17,867
Well, you ruined that for me.

883
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:19,629
Who should I go to now?

884
00:43:20,852 --> 00:43:21,740
Uncle, why don't you tell him?

885
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,560
Is there a single person...

886
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,759
in the entire village who 
would give me a loan on his word?

887
00:43:25,759 --> 00:43:27,236
Even if you don't help me, fine.

888
00:43:28,007 --> 00:43:29,142
Just don't get in my way.

889
00:43:29,376 --> 00:43:30,039
Counsel him, uncle.

890
00:43:35,385 --> 00:43:36,239
Did you hear him?

891
00:43:36,507 --> 00:43:38,502
He will take care of his problems. 
Just don't get in his way.

892
00:43:40,764 --> 00:43:41,421
Okay.

893
00:43:48,023 --> 00:43:48,731
Please, sit down,

894
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:51,922
It's fresh.

895
00:43:53,107 --> 00:43:54,012
Please bless me husband.

896
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:55,508
I made you this lentil pancake 
and upma because you like it.

897
00:43:57,592 --> 00:43:59,120
Please, swear on me. 
Come to the point.

898
00:44:00,208 --> 00:44:02,707
-Our son... 
-The young man who is like our son...

899
00:44:02,812 --> 00:44:03,335
Yes, yes. That's what I meant.

900
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:05,115
His merchant said that he wouldn't 
provide our fellow with collateral.

901
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,374
-So? 
-Give him a loan without collateral.

902
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:14,672
So, you got me this lentil 
pancake just to get me fired.

903
00:44:15,316 --> 00:44:16,794
If we give him a loan 
without taking a collateral,

904
00:44:16,994 --> 00:44:17,885
we will be begging on the streets.

905
00:44:18,127 --> 00:44:19,694
Why do we need to beg on the streets?

906
00:44:19,894 --> 00:44:22,012
Withdraw 5 lakhs from the 
bank's coffers and give it to him.

907
00:44:26,675 --> 00:44:28,618
I found a very good deal. 
I will return the money in a week.

908
00:44:31,342 --> 00:44:34,173
I am... looking at you both...

909
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:38,699
I feel like... I am looking at terrorists 
from the streets of Araku valley.

910
00:44:38,805 --> 00:44:40,046
Believe me, sir. 
I will return the money in a week.

911
00:44:40,246 --> 00:44:40,680
Nonsense!

912
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,252
The money your father 
borrowed for you education...

913
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:44,033
with your house as 
collateral is still unpaid.

914
00:44:44,185 --> 00:44:45,484
And you tell me you are 
going to pay me back in a week.

915
00:44:46,592 --> 00:44:49,644
Well... if I personally want to lend you 
that sort of money... I don't have it.

916
00:44:49,748 --> 00:44:52,995
Why would he need to take a loan out? 
Just steal from the bank.

917
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,268
I meant... get it.

918
00:44:55,675 --> 00:44:58,958
Next month, a higher official is 
going to come to the bank for an audit.

919
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:00,422
I am talking about a week and 
you are talking about a month.

920
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:01,884
If you give me the loan, 
I will be able to settle down.

921
00:45:02,084 --> 00:45:03,001
-Just give him the loan, uncle. 
-Hey!

922
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,231
Alright, fine.

923
00:45:07,031 --> 00:45:08,251
You said you would be able 
to settle yourself, right?

924
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:10,330
Alright, I am going to take that risk.

925
00:45:11,633 --> 00:45:13,135
You will return it to me in a week, right?

926
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,900
I will return it to you 
in a basket of vegetables.

927
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,270
Mummy...

928
00:45:35,542 --> 00:45:39,371
Subramanyam, don't just be late to work. 
Learn to leave on time.

929
00:45:39,874 --> 00:45:45,874
You have three children and a wife. Do you 
need to gossip with Sujatha at 5:30 pm?

930
00:45:46,308 --> 00:45:48,452
Leave! Everyone leave! 
Take your bags and just leave!

931
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:49,861
Just leave the bank and go, I say!

932
00:46:04,954 --> 00:46:09,133
This is the first time in life I am 
going to steal from the bank. Mummy...

933
00:46:10,050 --> 00:46:11,652
The manager said that he would be here.

934
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:15,199
This is the first time in my life...

935
00:46:16,217 --> 00:46:17,938
You will return it in a week, right?

936
00:46:18,434 --> 00:46:20,786
-I'll return it in a basket of vegetables. 
-Mummy...

937
00:46:27,082 --> 00:46:32,247
I am your husband and a man. 
How could you braid my hair?

938
00:46:32,766 --> 00:46:35,185
Our daughter has gone to take a bath. 
There is no one around for me to work on.

939
00:46:35,592 --> 00:46:36,968
I might lose my rhythm.

940
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:42,188
It's our daughter's phone. 
Let me go!

941
00:46:42,388 --> 00:46:45,141
Oh no! No! 
Stay here. Sit down for a minute.

942
00:46:48,052 --> 00:46:50,452
-Oh, my dear! It's almost done! 
-Such a pain in the neck!

943
00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:52,211
Looks like I am fated to have 
my hair braided. Finish it!

944
00:46:52,706 --> 00:46:53,924
Oh dear! 
Husband...

945
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:55,934
Hello?

946
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:57,762
You picked up a lady's phone. 
Who the hell are you?

947
00:46:58,092 --> 00:47:02,053
I am the chief of Padmanpuram village. 
Bahadur... Raja Bahadur here.

948
00:47:04,008 --> 00:47:07,213
Oh, no! 
So, all these days, she tricked me?!

949
00:47:09,815 --> 00:47:13,271
Hello? Why aren't you calling me? 
Don't you want your 99 rupees?

950
00:47:13,566 --> 00:47:15,274
-I found the girl! 
-What?

951
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:18,002
By mistake, I called another 
number instead of the one...

952
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:19,118
I was supposed to be calling.

953
00:47:19,318 --> 00:47:21,824
I called her number from my number... 
long story short, I found the girl!

954
00:47:22,183 --> 00:47:24,024
I didn't understand a 
word of what you said.

955
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,398
Sit still, dear.

956
00:47:25,758 --> 00:47:29,237
Not just that... she gave me 99 
rupees and gave her heart as well.

957
00:47:29,561 --> 00:47:31,751
In the very first meeting, 
she was impressed and fell for me.

958
00:47:32,805 --> 00:47:35,024
I just booked corner seats at 
the movies for an evening show.

959
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,434
Wait and watch!

960
00:47:36,717 --> 00:47:38,108
We are going to have such a lot of fun!

961
00:47:38,624 --> 00:47:40,453
-Just stay there, I will come to you! 
-Yeah, right! Get here!

962
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:43,184
Stay, dear. The braid isn't done.

963
00:47:43,384 --> 00:47:44,932
Is braiding hair more 
important than your daughter's life?

964
00:47:45,383 --> 00:47:47,240
Braids are very important for a girl.

965
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:49,649
Your daughter's been on the phone talking 
to her boyfriend for the past 10 minutes,

966
00:47:49,847 --> 00:47:51,168
...and here you are worrying 
about her hair like a fool!

967
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:52,926
All you worry about is 
braids! Braids! Braids!

968
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,342
I will cut it off!

969
00:47:57,194 --> 00:47:58,640
Boss, the girl is coming.

970
00:48:00,303 --> 00:48:02,347
-[speaks gibberish] 
-Go safely.

971
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:11,512
Lord Hanuman, I am new to driving 
this car. You must watch out for me.

972
00:48:11,883 --> 00:48:13,344
The other day, you made me crash.

973
00:48:15,047 --> 00:48:16,809
No, I won't look. I will only look at you.

974
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:19,451
-What if you hit someone? 
-Why would I?

975
00:48:19,925 --> 00:48:21,673
This time, 
I purchased the idol for 300 bucks.

976
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:23,743
You must protect me. 
Don't jinx me.

977
00:48:26,928 --> 00:48:29,907
-I beg you... Keep your eyes on the road. 
-No, I won't.

978
00:48:30,258 --> 00:48:32,043
You keep watch. 
You look at the road and drive.

979
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,566
Drive, please... 
Hold the steering and see for yourself.

980
00:48:33,766 --> 00:48:35,322
You would know how scared I am.

981
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:38,831
Baby...

982
00:48:55,321 --> 00:48:57,511
One letter... 
(Speaks gibberish) Just one letter.

983
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:06,868
Tamanna is going to remove 
her saree and wave it around.

984
00:49:07,068 --> 00:49:08,361
I tore the ticket just for this.

985
00:49:15,948 --> 00:49:19,279
What the hell happened? 
Pankajam doesn't remove her saree...

986
00:49:19,532 --> 00:49:21,149
...and you guys don't let me watch 
when Tammanna's removing her saree!

987
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:23,171
What drink I drink for?! I don't care 
anymore! You guys watch it yourselves!

988
00:49:23,371 --> 00:49:24,073
Stop it!

989
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:26,079
Caught you!

990
00:49:26,249 --> 00:49:28,759
Suri! Where the hell are you?

991
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,470
Hello, sir. 
Hello, sir.

992
00:49:33,856 --> 00:49:34,514
Baby...

993
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:36,491
I was the one who received that 
money from you through google pay.

994
00:49:36,782 --> 00:49:37,182
Oh?

995
00:49:37,462 --> 00:49:39,416
I was the one who met 
you at that Gandhi statue.

996
00:49:40,276 --> 00:49:42,179
I was the one who asked you 
to meet me at the water pump.

997
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:43,174
Oh?

998
00:49:43,505 --> 00:49:44,547
I liked your personality

999
00:49:44,862 --> 00:49:49,654
and your words and fell in love with 
you. I wanted to get married to you.

1000
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:51,988
But, some girl comes along 
and tries to get close to you.

1001
00:49:52,188 --> 00:49:52,684
And you give in so easily?!

1002
00:49:52,996 --> 00:49:53,396
Baby...

1003
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:55,928
I wanted you to admit this. 
That is why I played a little trick.

1004
00:50:16,403 --> 00:50:18,170
"Baby... oh, Baby..."

1005
00:50:18,454 --> 00:50:21,848
"I think of your name and 
turned into a lovesick fool."

1006
00:50:25,668 --> 00:50:27,412
"Baby...oh, Baby."

1007
00:50:27,689 --> 00:50:30,754
"I forget my name; I've gone mad."

1008
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:36,281
"Hey baby..."

1009
00:50:36,847 --> 00:50:39,095
"You were born for me."

1010
00:50:39,388 --> 00:50:43,760
"Baby... You ruined my sleep."

1011
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,783
"Baby..."

1012
00:50:46,301 --> 00:50:52,301
"You painted on my heart that you 
love me with that kohl rimmed eyes."

1013
00:50:56,966 --> 00:50:58,121
"You are my angel."

1014
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:03,299
"You are my lover."

1015
00:51:06,031 --> 00:51:07,327
"You are my fantasy."

1016
00:51:07,625 --> 00:51:09,069
"You have slowly kindled my imagination,"

1017
00:51:09,269 --> 00:51:12,000
"fired up my thoughts 
and made them bright."

1018
00:51:21,048 --> 00:51:26,245
"Baby... oh, baby... 
The sky is at my fingertips."

1019
00:51:30,427 --> 00:51:35,420
"Baby... oh, baby... 
The earth beneath my feet trembles."

1020
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:43,829
"My baby... 
You have accepted my love for you."

1021
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:48,467
"Baby... 
I am lucky to have found you."

1022
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:52,566
"Baby... I like you,"

1023
00:51:53,038 --> 00:51:55,425
"you brought celebrations to my heart."

1024
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:57,449
"You are my loving queen."

1025
00:51:57,968 --> 00:52:02,095
"No. Don't look. Don't look. 
Don't kill me with your gazes."

1026
00:52:02,394 --> 00:52:06,601
"In your eyes that resemble the 
ocean, my heart swims like a fish."

1027
00:52:06,948 --> 00:52:08,606
"Hey baby..."

1028
00:52:09,412 --> 00:52:11,498
"You were born for me."

1029
00:52:11,679 --> 00:52:16,045
"Baby... 
You ruined my sleep."

1030
00:52:16,354 --> 00:52:18,168
"Baby..."

1031
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:24,721
"You painted on my heart that you love me 
with that kohl rimmed eyes."

1032
00:52:29,176 --> 00:52:30,474
"You are my angel."

1033
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:35,101
"You are my lover."

1034
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:39,608
"You are my fantasy."

1035
00:52:39,944 --> 00:52:41,394
"You have slowly kindled my imagination,"

1036
00:52:41,594 --> 00:52:44,403
"fired up my thoughts 
and made them bright."

1037
00:53:04,008 --> 00:53:05,756
I drive a truck for the Mahankali Mills.

1038
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,148
I don't want to get married anytime soon.

1039
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:10,474
I want to purchase a truck of my own and 
get to a place where I can support myself.

1040
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,062
and only if you agree...

1041
00:53:13,656 --> 00:53:14,499
I thought I might get...

1042
00:53:14,699 --> 00:53:16,580
a son-in-law who would use the excuse 
of love and ask me for my wealth.

1043
00:53:16,947 --> 00:53:17,405
Not bad.

1044
00:53:17,755 --> 00:53:19,343
You said you want to 
stand on your own two feet.

1045
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:20,719
Take your own time.

1046
00:53:21,344 --> 00:53:21,983
I like him, daughter.

1047
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:23,354
Thank you, sir.

1048
00:53:23,652 --> 00:53:24,130
I shall take my leave.

1049
00:53:24,962 --> 00:53:25,727
Thank you.

1050
00:53:26,845 --> 00:53:29,218
Is it enough if we like the guy?

1051
00:53:29,676 --> 00:53:30,669
We need to like his family as well.

1052
00:53:31,026 --> 00:53:32,061
Ask his father to come over.

1053
00:53:35,841 --> 00:53:36,481
Super!

1054
00:53:40,295 --> 00:53:41,137
Hey, Suri. What's up?

1055
00:53:41,337 --> 00:53:42,245
Hey, Gagan.. 
Where is my dad?

1056
00:53:42,869 --> 00:53:43,543
He is with me.

1057
00:53:43,835 --> 00:53:45,467
Ask dad to go to the 
village chief's house.

1058
00:53:45,918 --> 00:53:47,577
The chief wants to talk to my father 
about my marriage to his daughter.

1059
00:53:52,569 --> 00:53:55,136
-Please tell him to be careful. 
-Alright.

1060
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:05,975
Friend, there is a potential 
groom seeking the hand of...

1061
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:07,049
the daughter of the village head.

1062
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:09,595
Apparently, 
the potential groom's father...

1063
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:10,988
is visiting their house to 
discuss details of the marriage.

1064
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:15,263
Before that groom's 
father enters their village,

1065
00:54:15,372 --> 00:54:16,637
why don't you go the village head's house,

1066
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:17,886
pretend to be the potential 
groom's father and spoil the deal?

1067
00:54:19,537 --> 00:54:20,314
Nice idea!

1068
00:54:22,654 --> 00:54:24,269
What about the money to participate 
in the District Drama Competition?

1069
00:54:25,436 --> 00:54:29,603
Just go and ruin that alliance. 
I will arrange for the money.

1070
00:54:38,019 --> 00:54:39,019
Namaste, uncle.

1071
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:42,479
Come in.

1072
00:54:44,663 --> 00:54:46,345
Stop these stupid pleasantries...

1073
00:54:48,111 --> 00:54:49,310
...and go and call your father.

1074
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:50,469
Uncle?

1075
00:54:54,144 --> 00:54:54,778
Hello, sir.

1076
00:54:57,356 --> 00:54:58,345
My foot!

1077
00:54:58,728 --> 00:54:59,684
What is this disrespect?

1078
00:55:01,978 --> 00:55:04,061
You with your stupid face

1079
00:55:05,978 --> 00:55:07,186
is going to welcome me?!

1080
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:10,861
My son deserves an alliance...

1081
00:55:11,754 --> 00:55:12,532
with the daughters of parliamsentarians...

1082
00:55:13,253 --> 00:55:14,054
Or daughters of 
Legislative Assembly members...

1083
00:55:14,855 --> 00:55:17,155
...or a District Administrative Officer 
or a police officer from the high cadre.

1084
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,102
I am going to hit you hard!

1085
00:55:19,114 --> 00:55:20,068
What's the trouble there?

1086
00:55:21,371 --> 00:55:21,910
Is she your wife?

1087
00:55:22,228 --> 00:55:22,783
Yes. So?

1088
00:55:23,052 --> 00:55:23,775
So, what?

1089
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:28,601
What are you guys doing? 
Where are you going?

1090
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:34,652
Uncle, what's all this?

1091
00:55:36,673 --> 00:55:37,489
Not just this.

1092
00:55:37,894 --> 00:55:40,980
You come to my house and disrespect us 
and even steal my wife's necklace?

1093
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,684
You don't know what I'm capable of.

1094
00:55:43,861 --> 00:55:44,856
Emotional, huh?

1095
00:55:45,049 --> 00:55:45,984
My men are not around right now.

1096
00:55:46,603 --> 00:55:48,039
If they were, 
I would have made them thrash you!

1097
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:49,857
Nice idea! 
Let's try it.

1098
00:55:50,224 --> 00:55:53,133
And the match begins now! 
He takes into the hands...

1099
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:54,620
-Rotating... rotating... 
-Uncle! Uncle!

1100
00:55:55,146 --> 00:55:56,791
-Bang it! Bang it! Yeah! 
-What is this, uncle?

1101
00:55:57,235 --> 00:56:00,877
-Yes! Yes! Beating! 
-Please stop, uncle!

1102
00:56:01,077 --> 00:56:02,269
And throwed him!

1103
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,576
How dare you come to my house and beat me?

1104
00:56:07,098 --> 00:56:08,641
Even if I die, I wouldn't get 
my daughter married to you son.

1105
00:56:13,914 --> 00:56:15,310
Please get out of my house, uncle!

1106
00:56:18,448 --> 00:56:19,498
What's all this, dear?

1107
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:20,881
Even I don't understand this.

1108
00:56:22,046 --> 00:56:26,465
This is just a sample. 
Let's meet on the stage.

1109
01:01:31,006 --> 01:01:33,786
Honey, he really did a good job. 
Let's just give him back his money.

1110
01:01:34,366 --> 01:01:38,732
Don't take it personally. 
You mean to say that his money...

1111
01:01:39,608 --> 01:01:41,002
They are independent of one another.

1112
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:46,762
You did a fabulous job. 
I am sure that the prize money is yours.

1113
01:01:47,994 --> 01:01:49,967
The next two teams have been 
winners in the past two years.

1114
01:01:50,288 --> 01:01:51,111
It's not going to be easy.

1115
01:01:51,398 --> 01:01:53,140
Don't assume that the cup 
is already in your kitty!

1116
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:58,111
Don't feel bad, buddy. 
I am sure that the prize is yours.

1117
01:02:08,502 --> 01:02:09,644
The cup is ours.

1118
01:02:10,817 --> 01:02:14,278
This time... 
...the cup is ours.

1119
01:02:14,894 --> 01:02:18,627
Father, my boss participated in the 
competition and did an awesome job.

1120
01:02:18,936 --> 01:02:21,177
If his son saw the performance, 
I am sure it will blow his mind away.

1121
01:02:21,644 --> 01:02:22,739
He is ready to erupt!

1122
01:02:31,905 --> 01:02:32,485
What happened?

1123
01:02:33,136 --> 01:02:35,940
-You need to be beaten! 
-Why? Why are you hitting him?

1124
01:02:44,936 --> 01:02:45,481
Stop!

1125
01:02:48,186 --> 01:02:49,294
Did you go to the village head's house?

1126
01:02:51,103 --> 01:02:52,120
Did you ruin the alliance?

1127
01:02:55,311 --> 01:02:57,561
Even though you knew your son is in 
love with the village headman's daughter,

1128
01:02:57,761 --> 01:02:59,811
you still went and ruined the alliance.

1129
01:03:05,844 --> 01:03:08,487
Father? 
Don't put up an act in front of me.

1130
01:03:08,853 --> 01:03:09,497
Do that outside.

1131
01:03:09,697 --> 01:03:10,421
I told Mahankali Mill owner's brother...

1132
01:03:10,621 --> 01:03:12,649
to advise you to be cautious when 
dealing with the village headman.

1133
01:03:13,478 --> 01:03:14,921
Despite that you went 
ahead and ruined the alliance.

1134
01:03:15,394 --> 01:03:17,936
That can only mean that you 
don't want your son to be happy.

1135
01:03:19,728 --> 01:03:20,225
Father... father...

1136
01:03:20,894 --> 01:03:22,872
Stop making that innocent 
face and putting up an act!

1137
01:03:23,113 --> 01:03:23,951
It's irritating!

1138
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:27,722
Alright!

1139
01:03:28,728 --> 01:03:29,519
Fine, you ruined my love life.

1140
01:03:30,603 --> 01:03:32,423
I wanted to buy a truck and settle down.

1141
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:33,503
So, I asked around for money

1142
01:03:33,703 --> 01:03:35,376
and was finally able to 
arrange five lakhs for myself.

1143
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:37,978
You even stole that 
money from the cupboard.

1144
01:03:40,022 --> 01:03:42,561
Tell me. 
Did you take out the money or not?

1145
01:03:50,853 --> 01:03:53,193
Sorry, my friend. 
You hit my brother, right.

1146
01:03:53,403 --> 01:03:56,464
So, he asked me not to pay you any money. 
Get lost!

1147
01:04:11,959 --> 01:04:12,650
Stop it, father!

1148
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:18,394
Any father would want his son 
to surpass his achievements.

1149
01:04:18,811 --> 01:04:21,186
But you... why do you want to 
crush your son and get ahead in life?!

1150
01:04:21,386 --> 01:04:22,519
What kind of a sadistic behavior is this?!

1151
01:04:25,311 --> 01:04:27,357
I cannot tolerate this any 
longer. I am going crazy.

1152
01:04:27,557 --> 01:04:29,603
Looking at your 
shenanigans, is driving me crazy!

1153
01:04:32,795 --> 01:04:33,245
Don't touch me! 
Get lost!

1154
01:04:36,419 --> 01:04:37,020
Get lost! 
Go!

1155
01:05:23,769 --> 01:05:25,268
Why did you give me the tablet?

1156
01:05:26,669 --> 01:05:28,096
If you didn't, good riddance. 
I would have died.

1157
01:05:29,478 --> 01:05:31,644
You can go ahead and keep on 
acting to your heart's content.

1158
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:41,228
Do me a favor, father.

1159
01:05:43,144 --> 01:05:45,110
Can you please leave me and go far away?

1160
01:05:47,311 --> 01:05:47,876
Never mind that.

1161
01:05:48,773 --> 01:05:50,068
Why will you leave?

1162
01:05:51,603 --> 01:05:52,853
I shall leave.

1163
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:27,797
Hari?

1164
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,797
Hari?

1165
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:31,422
Hari?

1166
01:07:32,672 --> 01:07:35,505
Since you called me this many times 
by my name,

1167
01:07:35,755 --> 01:07:37,797
I am sure there is something that's 
going to be the death of me.

1168
01:07:38,505 --> 01:07:39,297
Come to the point.

1169
01:07:39,672 --> 01:07:40,130
Our son...

1170
01:07:40,339 --> 01:07:41,797
Our son or the young man 
who is like our son?

1171
01:07:42,005 --> 01:07:45,089
Well... the young man who is 
like our son, called.

1172
01:07:45,255 --> 01:07:45,964
Called, and?

1173
01:07:46,464 --> 01:07:47,339
Money...

1174
01:07:47,547 --> 01:07:48,505
Did he say he was going to return it?

1175
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:51,047
Apparently, the money was stolen 
from his cupboard.

1176
01:07:53,714 --> 01:07:54,464
Hari?

1177
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,130
Mummy! Mummy!

1178
01:07:57,089 --> 01:08:00,130
The next month, a higher official 
is going to audit the bank.

1179
01:08:00,297 --> 01:08:01,005
Excuse me.

1180
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:06,180
Who are you?

1181
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,089
You seem well-dressed and yet, 
look like you are here to beg.

1182
01:08:09,797 --> 01:08:12,005
I am the officer who has come 
to audit the Godavari bank.

1183
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,755
I went to the bank but you were 
not there.

1184
01:08:14,547 --> 01:08:15,255
Sir!

1185
01:08:16,964 --> 01:08:19,339
You said that you would come down 
the next month?

1186
01:08:19,547 --> 01:08:23,005
Actually, the next week, I planned a trip 
to the US with my wife and kids.

1187
01:08:23,255 --> 01:08:25,380
So, in the meanwhile, I wanted 
to finish up with the audit.

1188
01:08:26,005 --> 01:08:26,592
Shall we go?

1189
01:08:26,792 --> 01:08:27,380
Yeah, right!

1190
01:08:27,505 --> 01:08:28,880
You keep planning those 
pleasure trips to the US...

1191
01:08:29,005 --> 01:08:30,297
...along with your family...

1192
01:08:30,505 --> 01:08:32,422
...and here you are, arriving unannounced 
and giving us no time to prepare.

1193
01:08:32,547 --> 01:08:34,755
You arrive before time, 
all dressed and ready!

1194
01:08:34,955 --> 01:08:36,255
Excuse, me. Hello! 
What are you saying?

1195
01:08:36,464 --> 01:08:39,630
Sir, what I am actually trying to say is,

1196
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:42,630
this visit of yours is such a rare one.

1197
01:08:43,714 --> 01:08:45,964
Wouldn't you like to come inside 
and take a look at our home?

1198
01:08:46,297 --> 01:08:47,255
Come in, sir.

1199
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,755
This is the cupboard we purchased after 
finishing with plastering and painting the walls.

1200
01:08:49,797 --> 01:08:50,589
This usually has books inside them.

1201
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,005
This is scale. 
You must already know about this.

1202
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:55,297
When you were a kid, your teacher 
must have probably hit you with this.

1203
01:08:55,497 --> 01:08:56,264
This is a chair.

1204
01:08:56,464 --> 01:08:57,797
These are spectacles.

1205
01:08:58,297 --> 01:09:00,630
These can be worn when in the sun 
and can be removed like this.

1206
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:02,214
This is a dog.

1207
01:09:02,422 --> 01:09:04,880
It is a toy dog. It doesn't bark.

1208
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:05,797
Sir!

1209
01:09:06,464 --> 01:09:07,714
Kindly pay attention, sir.

1210
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:09,172
That's about my house all.

1211
01:09:09,672 --> 01:09:10,380
That's all.

1212
01:09:11,047 --> 01:09:11,589
Are you done?

1213
01:09:11,755 --> 01:09:12,422
Yes, sir.

1214
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,047
It's one o'clock. It would be better 
if we head to the bank.

1215
01:09:16,247 --> 01:09:17,130
Sure, go and head to the bank!

1216
01:09:17,255 --> 01:09:19,755
As if the audit books are lying open 
waiting for you to read them!

1217
01:09:19,964 --> 01:09:21,089
Hey! What are you talking?

1218
01:09:21,297 --> 01:09:22,714
What l'm actually trying to say is,

1219
01:09:23,505 --> 01:09:24,922
it's lunch time at one o' clock.

1220
01:09:24,964 --> 01:09:26,214
Everyone must have gone out 
to have their lunch.

1221
01:09:26,255 --> 01:09:28,089
You visiting my house is such 
a rare occasion.

1222
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,505
Won't you allow us to serve 
you a meal?

1223
01:09:29,714 --> 01:09:30,630
Araku hospitality?

1224
01:09:31,339 --> 01:09:32,172
You are quite thin.

1225
01:09:32,589 --> 01:09:33,672
Please have a little.

1226
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:34,922
I will feed you personally.

1227
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:35,964
Come, sir.

1228
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,339
You must come, sir.

1229
01:09:39,005 --> 01:09:41,922
One morsel for mother; 
one morsel for father.

1230
01:09:42,172 --> 01:09:43,339
One morsel for grandfather.

1231
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:45,214
Are you feeding me or my soul?

1232
01:09:45,505 --> 01:09:46,880
Naughty sir!

1233
01:09:48,464 --> 01:09:51,297
No matter how late... 
you should wash slowly.

1234
01:09:52,089 --> 01:09:55,630
You have the world record of 
serving a meal for four hours.

1235
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,005
It's my pressure, sir.

1236
01:09:57,547 --> 01:09:58,672
I mean my pleasure.

1237
01:10:01,005 --> 01:10:01,714
It's five o'clock.

1238
01:10:01,797 --> 01:10:02,547
Shall we head to the bank?

1239
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:03,547
Sure, go and head to the bank, sir!

1240
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:06,047
Open the shutters of the bank and 
get the audit books out and read them!

1241
01:10:06,214 --> 01:10:07,014
Hey! What's wrong with you?

1242
01:10:07,214 --> 01:10:08,547
What l'm actually trying to say is...

1243
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:09,589
it's closing time now.

1244
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:11,130
Everyone must have gone to sleep.

1245
01:10:12,005 --> 01:10:13,047
Even you must rest.

1246
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:13,964
I will show you the bedroom, sir.

1247
01:10:14,547 --> 01:10:15,505
It's okay.

1248
01:10:15,922 --> 01:10:16,714
I shall leave.

1249
01:10:17,172 --> 01:10:18,547
At least tomorrow, 
let's head to the bank...

1250
01:10:18,672 --> 01:10:19,505
Impossible, sir!

1251
01:10:20,005 --> 01:10:20,555
Why?

1252
01:10:20,755 --> 01:10:21,630
It's Sunday, sir.

1253
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:22,714
God!

1254
01:10:25,005 --> 01:10:26,880
So, you are going to audit my bank?!

1255
01:10:27,089 --> 01:10:28,589
Let's see if I take you to 
the bank in the first place!

1256
01:10:29,464 --> 01:10:31,630
The Araku walk!

1257
01:10:32,464 --> 01:10:33,172
Come!

1258
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:40,130
Brother...

1259
01:13:40,755 --> 01:13:41,964
I couldn't arrange 
for the money.

1260
01:13:42,255 --> 01:13:43,380
If you could give me a week.

1261
01:13:43,672 --> 01:13:45,297
A week? That won't do.

1262
01:13:45,464 --> 01:13:47,172
If you don't hand over the money 
within three days and take the vehicle,

1263
01:13:47,422 --> 01:13:48,630
forget about the vehicle entirely!

1264
01:14:02,922 --> 01:14:05,957
I will convince my father that it 
was your father's fault and not yours.

1265
01:14:06,295 --> 01:14:08,254
I will even tell my father to 
look for a job in Hyderabad.

1266
01:14:08,674 --> 01:14:10,505
As soon as they find a job for you, 
let's leave.

1267
01:14:10,714 --> 01:14:12,130
I am trying to arrange for money 
to buy a truck.

1268
01:14:13,005 --> 01:14:14,130
Let's wait around for a couple of days.

1269
01:14:14,672 --> 01:14:15,880
If that doesn't pan out, 
let's go with your plan.

1270
01:14:16,380 --> 01:14:17,505
Even I don't like being here.

1271
01:14:21,172 --> 01:14:23,172
Boss!

1272
01:14:25,672 --> 01:14:26,839
Boss!

1273
01:14:28,339 --> 01:14:30,422
Boss!

1274
01:14:31,547 --> 01:14:32,630
Boss!

1275
01:14:36,755 --> 01:14:38,464
Boss!

1276
01:14:45,464 --> 01:14:47,380
Boss!

1277
01:14:48,964 --> 01:14:50,297
(crying)

1278
01:14:51,047 --> 01:14:53,297
Boss!

1279
01:14:55,422 --> 01:14:57,630
Boss!

1280
01:14:58,297 --> 01:14:59,714
Boss!

1281
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:01,880
(crying)

1282
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:14,505
(breathing deeply and exhaling)

1283
01:15:22,180 --> 01:15:25,014
Ever since he was a kid, he grew up 
a lot more with him than with me.

1284
01:15:26,055 --> 01:15:28,347
When he couldn't find him anymore, 
he became like this...

1285
01:15:29,764 --> 01:15:31,180
It was just his son who reprimanded him.

1286
01:15:31,722 --> 01:15:33,097
Why would he take it to heart 
and leave?

1287
01:15:33,680 --> 01:15:34,389
Please don't cry, son.

1288
01:15:34,555 --> 01:15:35,472
(speaks gibberish)

1289
01:15:35,930 --> 01:15:37,055
I hate you, boss.

1290
01:15:41,305 --> 01:15:42,222
What are you guys doing here?

1291
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:44,180
He is heartbroken that he 
couldn't find your father.

1292
01:15:44,722 --> 01:15:45,430
Heartbroken?

1293
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:46,722
Go and jump in a well and die.

1294
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:52,597
That's not it, nephew.

1295
01:15:52,805 --> 01:15:53,514
Stop it, uncle.

1296
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:57,222
You might be sad but I am very happy.

1297
01:15:57,555 --> 01:16:00,472
Even if he turns up tomorrow by 
mistake, he is as good as dead to me.

1298
01:16:29,139 --> 01:16:31,264
(crying softly)

1299
01:19:09,639 --> 01:19:10,597
Akashvani...

1300
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,347
The centre of Visakhapatnam...

1301
01:19:15,764 --> 01:19:17,097
Hi, kids.

1302
01:19:17,347 --> 01:19:20,014
It's Sunday today and your 
radio uncle is here.

1303
01:19:20,514 --> 01:19:21,930
Shall we begin telling 
amazing stories?

1304
01:19:22,347 --> 01:19:23,889
Today, we shall listen to forest story.

1305
01:19:24,089 --> 01:19:24,972
Let's have some fun.

1306
01:19:25,264 --> 01:19:26,597
Lion...Tiger,

1307
01:19:27,555 --> 01:19:29,430
Children... Simba.

1308
01:19:29,555 --> 01:19:33,014
Skulk is trying to kill the Lion 
who is the king of the forest.

1309
01:19:33,214 --> 01:19:34,055
Then the Lion...

1310
01:19:37,930 --> 01:19:39,347
Warn them.. How dare you to kill me...?

1311
01:19:39,597 --> 01:19:41,139
Then the foxes saw it and...

1312
01:19:45,264 --> 01:19:49,305
apologized to the lion and fled.

1313
01:20:02,180 --> 01:20:03,180
Father, how about a tongue twister 
challenge?

1314
01:20:03,597 --> 01:20:05,764
Four black lorries; six red lorries.

1315
01:20:06,097 --> 01:20:06,805
Keep repeating this without pause.

1316
01:20:07,055 --> 01:20:08,180
You can't do it, man

1317
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:09,639
Alright, challenge accepted.

1318
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,639
Four black lorries; six red lorries

1319
01:20:11,805 --> 01:20:13,347
Four black lorries; six red lorries.

1320
01:20:13,639 --> 01:20:14,972
Four black lorries; six red lorries.

1321
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,472
Four black lorries; six red lorries.

1322
01:20:16,764 --> 01:20:17,680
Stop it!

1323
01:20:18,389 --> 01:20:19,972
What did your mother feed you 
when you were young?

1324
01:20:20,264 --> 01:20:22,264
Your sister fell in love with me 
because of my vocal capacity.

1325
01:20:23,805 --> 01:20:24,764
Oh! Really?

1326
01:20:28,430 --> 01:20:29,889
Now, with this water...

1327
01:20:32,555 --> 01:20:33,722
No, father! No!

1328
01:20:34,014 --> 01:20:34,805
No!

1329
01:20:35,222 --> 01:20:36,639
Why did you give me your chain?

1330
01:20:38,597 --> 01:20:41,514
Dear, keep this necklace on you 
as a way to remember me and our son.

1331
01:20:41,764 --> 01:20:42,472
Okay?

1332
01:21:25,139 --> 01:21:25,972
Morning...Bank...

1333
01:21:26,305 --> 01:21:27,972
You said that you would take me 
to the bank in the morning.

1334
01:21:28,389 --> 01:21:29,722
Why did you make me climb 
the mountain?

1335
01:21:30,055 --> 01:21:33,347
Sir, why do you constantly keep 
harping on about bank and audit?

1336
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,264
Please, receive our hospitality.

1337
01:21:35,555 --> 01:21:36,639
Look at the beauty of Araku valley.

1338
01:21:36,930 --> 01:21:38,097
Sir...look at that beauty.

1339
01:21:38,347 --> 01:21:40,180
The beauty of Araku valley? 
Where is it?

1340
01:21:40,472 --> 01:21:41,930
Sir, what are you talking about?!

1341
01:21:42,514 --> 01:21:44,889
Waterfall... the waterfall...

1342
01:21:45,055 --> 01:21:45,722
This?

1343
01:21:45,930 --> 01:21:47,139
Yes, the famous Araku waterfalls.

1344
01:21:47,347 --> 01:21:48,097
Falls...

1345
01:21:48,305 --> 01:21:49,222
I saw Niagara Falls.

1346
01:21:49,597 --> 01:21:52,514
Sir, you keep going to foreign 
countries and visiting all sorts of falls!

1347
01:21:52,722 --> 01:21:53,597
Won't you promote Indian tourism?

1348
01:21:53,805 --> 01:21:54,472
I just don't understand!

1349
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:55,430
What is your problem?!

1350
01:21:55,639 --> 01:21:56,139
Hey!

1351
01:21:56,347 --> 01:21:57,014
Why are you shouting?!

1352
01:21:57,347 --> 01:21:59,347
Well, sir, 
what I am actually trying to say is,

1353
01:21:59,555 --> 01:22:03,180
won't you look at the mountains and 
valleys? At the stones and boulders?

1354
01:22:03,639 --> 01:22:04,389
These are two mountains, sir.

1355
01:22:04,597 --> 01:22:06,597
This is the smaller one and 
that is the bigger one.

1356
01:22:06,805 --> 01:22:07,597
Sir, no reference to 
Vijay Devarakonda.

1357
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,264
In between, there is a 'V'.

1358
01:22:09,472 --> 01:22:10,430
No reference to the Indraganti's 
movie 'V'.

1359
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:11,555
V stands for valley.

1360
01:22:11,722 --> 01:22:12,555
Valli.

1361
01:22:12,722 --> 01:22:15,722
When you get to the top of that 
mountain, you can see Tirumala.

1362
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:16,889
Are you going to make me climb it?

1363
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:17,639
Do you want to climb?

1364
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:20,055
Let's go to the bank!

1365
01:22:20,264 --> 01:22:21,764
And, again with the bank!

1366
01:22:21,972 --> 01:22:23,514
You don't seem to be someone 
who knows how to have fun!

1367
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:28,055
You are walking very fast.

1368
01:22:29,264 --> 01:22:30,055
I am watching you!

1369
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,871
(snoring)

1370
01:22:34,191 --> 01:22:35,714
He seems to be very quick on his feet.

1371
01:22:35,922 --> 01:22:38,089
If he continues at this pace, he'd finish 
touring the entire Araku in two days.

1372
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:40,130
We need to stop him somehow.

1373
01:22:40,297 --> 01:22:40,964
How?

1374
01:22:41,672 --> 01:22:44,464
Be quick on your feet like a deer and 
get me a very dear flower pot of yours.

1375
01:22:45,714 --> 01:22:47,755
Bank...audit...

1376
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:49,172
Bank, huh?

1377
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,880
Hail, Seetaram Babu!

1378
01:22:55,130 --> 01:22:57,172
(yells)

1379
01:23:11,297 --> 01:23:11,839
What's up with you?

1380
01:23:12,047 --> 01:23:13,047
Why are you walking with your head 
in the air?

1381
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:15,339
Uncle, I have a very protective 
father, right?

1382
01:23:16,005 --> 01:23:17,089
I just cannot control my happiness.

1383
01:23:17,297 --> 01:23:18,589
I am going crazy that is why 
my head is in the air.

1384
01:23:18,797 --> 01:23:21,880
So, you believe that your father 
stole the money?

1385
01:23:22,464 --> 01:23:24,922
He did admit it that he stole 
the money.

1386
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:27,505
Some truths can be told because 
you have a mouth.

1387
01:23:28,047 --> 01:23:31,089
Your father cannot speak, so he 
cannot disclose certain truths.

1388
01:23:32,797 --> 01:23:35,547
Your father didn't know that you were in 
love with that village headman's daughter.

1389
01:23:37,797 --> 01:23:40,839
Do you know why he goes about 
trying to perform

1390
01:23:41,047 --> 01:23:43,547
instead of just spending the rest of 
his life at home with your earnings?

1391
01:23:44,047 --> 01:23:47,547
It's because, he wants to use his talent, 
do something or another and make sure

1392
01:23:47,755 --> 01:23:50,547
he buys you a truck without 
any need for a loan.

1393
01:23:50,964 --> 01:23:51,922
That's his dream.

1394
01:23:57,229 --> 01:24:00,270
Mahankali's brother took advantage of 
the situation and cheated your father.

1395
01:24:00,854 --> 01:24:04,104
It's because he didn't have any other 
choice that he had to take the money.

1396
01:24:08,145 --> 01:24:11,395
You always accuse your father of 
prioritizing his passion over you, right?

1397
01:24:11,979 --> 01:24:14,520
Do you even know what he had 
to give up for you?

1398
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:22,312
Sir... your friend Sampath 
has a role in our movie.

1399
01:24:22,645 --> 01:24:24,187
Tell him to start immediately 
and come here.

1400
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:25,187
Okay.

1401
01:24:25,812 --> 01:24:27,020
Those people from the movies 
got in touch.

1402
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,520
Your dream's going to come true.

1403
01:24:28,687 --> 01:24:30,062
Pack your bags immediately and go.

1404
01:24:30,104 --> 01:24:30,854
Okay.

1405
01:24:32,312 --> 01:24:34,979
Husband! Husband!

1406
01:24:38,604 --> 01:24:39,270
Suri..

1407
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:44,604
Son...

1408
01:24:47,145 --> 01:24:48,604
Your son has a respiratory problem.

1409
01:24:48,979 --> 01:24:50,520
There is a high chance that this is 
going to be a lifelong health issue.

1410
01:24:50,729 --> 01:24:51,770
Whenever he experiences 
a shortness of breath,

1411
01:24:51,937 --> 01:24:53,020
you must give him tablets.

1412
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:55,312
If you are not careful, it might 
cost your son his life.

1413
01:24:56,104 --> 01:24:58,812
His parents must always be with him.

1414
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,104
(crying)

1415
01:25:08,020 --> 01:25:09,062
Such a huge opportunity!

1416
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:10,770
Isn't your dream to become an actor?

1417
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:12,437
Why would you suddenly 
not want to go?

1418
01:25:13,770 --> 01:25:16,479
Nothing is more important to me 
than my son's health.

1419
01:25:17,437 --> 01:25:18,895
I must be close to him to 
take care of him.

1420
01:25:32,145 --> 01:25:34,437
For your health and to 
take care of you,

1421
01:25:34,645 --> 01:25:38,895
your sacrificed his dream and his talent.

1422
01:25:44,854 --> 01:25:50,437
Everyday, on the radio, your father's 
voice would attract many followers.

1423
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:52,729
Do you know how he lost his voice?

1424
01:25:58,729 --> 01:25:59,604
Husband, it's raining.

1425
01:25:59,687 --> 01:26:00,850
Why don't you pull over?

1426
01:26:01,124 --> 01:26:02,312
Don't stop, father. Don't.

1427
01:26:02,515 --> 01:26:03,645
- Let's get wet in the rain when we ride. 
- Alright! Alright!

1428
01:26:04,145 --> 01:26:04,560
Please, stop.

1429
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:06,366
Let it go... 
He wants to get wet in the rain.

1430
01:26:17,104 --> 01:26:17,854
Dad...

1431
01:26:44,937 --> 01:26:45,604
Dad...

1432
01:26:45,895 --> 01:26:46,562
Dad...

1433
01:26:47,437 --> 01:26:48,104
Mom...

1434
01:26:48,937 --> 01:26:49,604
Mom...

1435
01:26:51,187 --> 01:26:51,854
Mom...

1436
01:26:53,395 --> 01:26:54,062
Mom...

1437
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,895
Mom...

1438
01:27:15,145 --> 01:27:18,645
Your father lost his wife and 
his voice in the rain.

1439
01:27:19,479 --> 01:27:22,395
He is an innocent harmless fellow 
who sought revenge on the rain.

1440
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,395
How would the nature know 
who is good and who isn't?

1441
01:27:29,895 --> 01:27:32,937
You spoke in anger and 
he left in pain.

1442
01:27:33,104 --> 01:27:34,604
I don't know where he went.

1443
01:27:35,604 --> 01:27:36,812
But, I can tell you one thing -

1444
01:27:37,229 --> 01:27:40,187
When he returns, he will give back 
those five lakhs he took from you,

1445
01:27:40,387 --> 01:27:42,270
along with the interest accrued.

1446
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:58,862
"Suddenly it's gotten dark, 
emptiness rushes in this darkness."

1447
01:27:59,326 --> 01:28:04,187
"It's like a needle to the eye 
that leaves invisible prick marks."

1448
01:28:09,362 --> 01:28:13,520
"Where do I search for you? 
How do I search for you?"

1449
01:28:14,125 --> 01:28:18,395
"How can I live in this 
darkness after you left?"

1450
01:28:18,595 --> 01:28:22,979
"I am not the same as yesterday. 
"I have changed.

1451
01:28:23,849 --> 01:28:27,687
"I became a tear and 
dripped from the cheek."

1452
01:28:27,937 --> 01:28:32,520
"I became the lonely 
path that's lost you."

1453
01:28:32,854 --> 01:28:35,154
"It's gone. It's gone."

1454
01:28:35,354 --> 01:28:37,487
"All the fun and frolic has left."

1455
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:40,520
"You aren't around and so, 
even the laughter is missing."

1456
01:28:40,720 --> 01:28:42,937
"This entire village looks deserted."

1457
01:29:02,020 --> 01:29:06,354
"I am a brainless fool. 
I was in the booze."

1458
01:29:06,812 --> 01:29:11,104
"I couldn't see the real you."

1459
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:16,020
"Time is such a magician! 
It opened my eyes."

1460
01:29:16,613 --> 01:29:20,437
"And before I could lay my eyes on you"

1461
01:29:21,020 --> 01:29:25,562
"All the air that I need to 
breathe is all around me."

1462
01:29:26,226 --> 01:29:30,395
"My heart was deeply hurt"

1463
01:29:30,895 --> 01:29:35,812
"Look at the house you've left behind. 
Look at how devoid of life it is."

1464
01:29:36,012 --> 01:29:42,829
"If I don't get you back, 
it says I'm not welcome inside either."

1465
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:13,729
Father!

1466
01:31:00,812 --> 01:31:01,714
Suri?

1467
01:31:05,187 --> 01:31:07,583
Why would you ruin your life for 
some idiotic thing your father did?

1468
01:31:07,783 --> 01:31:08,816
I will get you both married.

1469
01:31:09,016 --> 01:31:10,395
Go and live happily somewhere.

1470
01:31:12,562 --> 01:31:13,437
I cannot go, sir.

1471
01:31:13,687 --> 01:31:14,645
I need to search for my father.

1472
01:31:14,854 --> 01:31:16,104
Why do you still keep holding 
onto your father?

1473
01:31:16,354 --> 01:31:17,895
Your father was the one 
who ruined your life.

1474
01:31:18,145 --> 01:31:19,812
What do you mean my father ruined my life?

1475
01:31:20,270 --> 01:31:22,770
My father sacrificed a lot for me.

1476
01:31:25,687 --> 01:31:26,770
You and I have our voices, sir.

1477
01:31:27,437 --> 01:31:28,854
So, we can talk as it pleases us.

1478
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:30,562
But he cannot speak.

1479
01:31:31,604 --> 01:31:33,770
He tried very hard to tell me that 
he didn't commit any mistake and

1480
01:31:33,979 --> 01:31:35,354
wanted to explain everything 
that's happened.

1481
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:38,062
But it was me. I was the one who 
shouted at him, lost my temper...

1482
01:31:38,270 --> 01:31:39,145
...and told him to get out of the house.

1483
01:31:41,395 --> 01:31:42,187
When children make mistakes,

1484
01:31:42,395 --> 01:31:44,645
parents correct them with 
a lot of patience and love.

1485
01:31:45,229 --> 01:31:47,687
But, as soon as children 
become adolescents,

1486
01:31:47,895 --> 01:31:51,479
they start getting annoyed and 
irritated with their parents.

1487
01:31:52,645 --> 01:31:55,354
Maybe I should have been a lot 
more patient with my father, sir.

1488
01:31:59,645 --> 01:32:00,770
They say that after a particular age,

1489
01:32:00,812 --> 01:32:02,020
your parents become your children.

1490
01:32:02,729 --> 01:32:03,979
Now, my father is my child.

1491
01:32:06,145 --> 01:32:07,437
Please let me search for my child, sir.

1492
01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:13,437
Suri Babu?

1493
01:34:13,604 --> 01:34:14,895
You mustn't jump about like that. 
You might fall.

1494
01:34:15,095 --> 01:34:15,812
My son is been jumping up and down.

1495
01:34:15,937 --> 01:34:17,520
Are we going to get him 
trained in pole jumping?

1496
01:34:17,645 --> 01:34:18,779
Doesn't matter how expensive it is.

1497
01:34:18,979 --> 01:34:20,187
Just search for a good coach 
to train him.

1498
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,121
Why you are not attending my calls..?

1499
01:37:49,163 --> 01:37:50,663
Just listen to me... two, three days...

1500
01:37:50,863 --> 01:37:51,296
What...?

1501
01:37:51,496 --> 01:37:51,963
Three more days..?

1502
01:37:52,163 --> 01:37:53,955
Due to unexpected reasons it got late... 
- How irresponsible you are..?

1503
01:37:53,996 --> 01:37:55,413
Stop that stupid explanation.

1504
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:56,955
Our tour date is approaching.

1505
01:37:57,330 --> 01:37:58,621
Hey, what are you doing?

1506
01:37:58,705 --> 01:37:59,913
I am searching for my dad.

1507
01:37:59,996 --> 01:38:01,380
Along with that, 
please try to repay the loan money.

1508
01:38:01,580 --> 01:38:04,330
My superior officer arrived for the audit 
and I'm roaming the entire Araku area.

1509
01:38:04,413 --> 01:38:05,246
Please wait some more days.

1510
01:38:05,288 --> 01:38:06,380
Repay the loan amount... please.

1511
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:08,080
Please manage some how. 
You are the manager, right?

1512
01:38:08,580 --> 01:38:09,621
Mummy...

1513
01:38:09,746 --> 01:38:10,288
Hello!

1514
01:38:10,913 --> 01:38:12,580
Why do you bring me here?

1515
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:15,663
I'll tell.

1516
01:38:16,788 --> 01:38:18,746
Sir, this is the apiculture.

1517
01:38:18,871 --> 01:38:20,871
I wish to show you this... 
that is the reason why we are here.

1518
01:38:21,871 --> 01:38:23,788
Are you the bank Manager or tourist guide?

1519
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:25,163
Sir 1:2 for you!

1520
01:38:25,830 --> 01:38:26,371
Okay?

1521
01:38:27,163 --> 01:38:27,996
Come on, let's go to bank.

1522
01:38:28,038 --> 01:38:30,205
Sir, Bank.. bank... bank... 
why do you always say bank?

1523
01:38:30,246 --> 01:38:30,913
Come on.. It's here, the bank...

1524
01:38:31,038 --> 01:38:32,288
See this Honey bank.

1525
01:38:34,955 --> 01:38:35,255
Let's go sir...

1526
01:38:35,455 --> 01:38:36,580
Come on run Sir... hurry.

1527
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:53,621
Hello baby, looks like it'd get delayed 
for two to three days here.

1528
01:42:53,821 --> 01:42:54,580
Again two more days...

1529
01:42:54,780 --> 01:42:55,421
What nonsense?

1530
01:42:55,621 --> 01:42:56,246
I don't want you...

1531
01:42:56,288 --> 01:42:58,288
Even I can yell at you.. Ok? 
You got the just listen

1532
01:42:58,488 --> 01:42:59,371
Our tour got cancelled.

1533
01:42:59,455 --> 01:43:01,080
Just listen to me. 
- As well as our relationship also.

1534
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:01,913
Okay, fine.

1535
01:43:02,038 --> 01:43:03,413
I will sending you the divorce papers.

1536
01:43:03,613 --> 01:43:03,913
Good bye!

1537
01:43:04,038 --> 01:43:04,580
Sir...

1538
01:43:05,663 --> 01:43:06,205
Sir...

1539
01:43:06,705 --> 01:43:08,580
Can we continue with the tour Sir?

1540
01:43:08,663 --> 01:43:09,288
Start!

1541
01:43:10,455 --> 01:43:11,913
The cow.

1542
01:43:12,371 --> 01:43:13,255
Sir, that is Araku cow.

1543
01:43:13,455 --> 01:43:18,330
Cow is white in colour like your hair 
and brown like your skin.

1544
01:43:19,288 --> 01:43:21,121
Sir, is there anything new 
to be discussed about a cow?

1545
01:43:21,288 --> 01:43:22,313
As you may know, 
it gives milk from the front...

1546
01:43:22,513 --> 01:43:23,538
and provides us with cow 
dung from its behind.

1547
01:43:23,746 --> 01:43:26,455
We can make coffee with its milk. 
We can also make dung cakes with its dung.

1548
01:43:26,655 --> 01:43:27,038
Sir...

1549
01:43:27,871 --> 01:43:29,621
very very important thing.

1550
01:43:29,955 --> 01:43:30,996
cow is...

1551
01:43:31,871 --> 01:43:33,663
The cow sounds 'moo' comfortably.

1552
01:43:33,863 --> 01:43:34,350
What?

1553
01:43:34,550 --> 01:43:35,038
Moo.

1554
01:43:35,371 --> 01:43:36,163
Once more.

1555
01:43:36,413 --> 01:43:37,121
Moo. 
(Imitating Cow)

1556
01:43:37,205 --> 01:43:37,996
Louder.

1557
01:43:38,246 --> 01:43:39,371
Mooo.

1558
01:43:39,955 --> 01:43:42,038
Mooo...

1559
01:43:42,205 --> 01:43:44,038
Mooo.

1560
01:43:44,163 --> 01:43:46,955
Mooo... 
(Imitating Cow)

1561
01:43:47,663 --> 01:43:48,746
Sir...

1562
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:55,205
After you are done screaming, 
we shall take a look at the Poultry farm.

1563
01:43:55,830 --> 01:43:57,163
Poultry farm..? 
- Yes!

1564
01:43:59,205 --> 01:44:01,080
(Imitating chicken)

1565
01:44:01,788 --> 01:44:02,705
Same.

1566
01:44:02,746 --> 01:44:04,038
(Imitating chicken)

1567
01:44:04,288 --> 01:44:05,146
Exactly same!

1568
01:44:05,346 --> 01:44:06,205
Let's go, Sir.

1569
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:13,955
Mahankali Mills owner is bad mouthing 
your father in the village.

1570
01:44:14,246 --> 01:44:16,455
Given the grudge he holds against 
your father for hitting him,

1571
01:44:16,502 --> 01:44:19,102
is it possible for him to 
have something to your father?

1572
01:44:33,163 --> 01:44:34,455
Mahankali, where is my father?

1573
01:44:34,496 --> 01:44:35,996
How would I know?

1574
01:44:36,163 --> 01:44:38,996
I told you that we don't know. 
Get out of here!

1575
01:44:39,246 --> 01:44:39,996
Go away!

1576
01:44:40,413 --> 01:44:41,163
Come...

1577
01:44:43,621 --> 01:44:47,663
As your father hit me, he must really 
be in the habit of hitting people.

1578
01:44:47,788 --> 01:44:51,205
One of his victims must have gotten angry 
and done something.

1579
01:44:51,413 --> 01:44:54,080
Dead bodies are usually found 
floating at the river bank.

1580
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:55,330
Go and search for him there.

1581
01:44:55,530 --> 01:44:56,663
Wait... no...

1582
01:45:02,496 --> 01:45:03,705
Tell me... where is my father?

1583
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,913
Tell... Speak out.

1584
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:15,288
Stop him.

1585
01:45:25,996 --> 01:45:27,330
Speak out... speak.

1586
01:45:27,455 --> 01:45:28,121
I don't know... 
- Tell...

1587
01:45:28,496 --> 01:45:29,663
Tell... tell... 
Where is my father?

1588
01:45:29,863 --> 01:45:30,413
Tell...

1589
01:45:31,163 --> 01:45:32,121
Please stop him someone.

1590
01:45:39,288 --> 01:45:39,955
Tell me.

1591
01:45:43,788 --> 01:45:46,621
He is stripping my dress and thrashing me! 
Someone, please stop him!

1592
01:45:47,621 --> 01:45:50,205
I am begging you. 
Please let me go!

1593
01:45:50,371 --> 01:45:52,038
I was just messing with you.

1594
01:45:52,330 --> 01:45:53,580
If something happens to my father...

1595
01:45:54,038 --> 01:45:54,913
I will...

1596
01:46:25,980 --> 01:46:27,771
Uncle, do you think he is alive?

1597
01:46:30,605 --> 01:46:33,021
If something happened to him... 
I can't live.

1598
01:46:34,438 --> 01:46:35,396
I can't live...

1599
01:46:35,771 --> 01:46:36,313
Son...

1600
01:46:36,688 --> 01:46:37,230
Son...

1601
01:46:42,105 --> 01:46:42,646
Son...

1602
01:46:48,396 --> 01:46:49,688
Sathish!

1603
01:46:51,730 --> 01:46:52,780
Suri is unable to breathe.

1604
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:54,813
You go to pharmacy and 
get medicines for him.

1605
01:46:55,013 --> 01:46:55,480
Take care.

1606
01:47:16,771 --> 01:47:17,230
Careful.

1607
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:18,188
Careful.

1608
01:49:35,438 --> 01:49:37,521
Where are you? 
Come fast.

1609
01:52:01,063 --> 01:52:01,938
Get up...

1610
01:52:02,605 --> 01:52:04,188
Son...

1611
01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:05,480
Get up, dear.

1612
01:52:29,438 --> 01:52:31,980
Where did you go?

1613
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:12,188
Dad... dad...

1614
01:53:12,396 --> 01:53:14,271
Dad... dad... dad...

1615
01:53:19,313 --> 01:53:22,938
What? All this while, you've been living 
in the well behind the house...

1616
01:53:23,138 --> 01:53:24,105
and we ended up looking 
for you everywhere?

1617
01:53:24,646 --> 01:53:29,063
Do you think we are kids to crawl 
and accidentally fall into that well?

1618
01:53:34,230 --> 01:53:35,730
Will you at least fill 
it up with earth now?

1619
01:53:38,355 --> 01:53:39,442
How much does that cost?

1620
01:53:39,642 --> 01:53:40,530
It was 25 grand back then.

1621
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:42,730
But now, due to the huge demand 
for my services, it's 50 grand.

1622
01:53:48,771 --> 01:53:52,813
Mr Gaali Sampath has won the 
first prize for the Year 2020-2021...

1623
01:53:53,013 --> 01:53:56,438
in the Gurajada All Andhra 
Districts Drama competition.

1624
01:53:56,688 --> 01:54:00,188
Gurajada Sundar Rao has presented 
a cheque of rupees 8 lakhs to the winner.

1625
01:54:10,271 --> 01:54:12,146
Happy Married Life!

1626
01:54:15,230 --> 01:54:19,396
Sir, my son must become the number one 
basketball player in the world.

1627
01:54:19,855 --> 01:54:20,405
Alright. Alright.

1628
01:54:20,605 --> 01:54:22,313
Ask him to throw the ball in the basket. 
- Go on, throw it!

1629
01:54:24,313 --> 01:54:26,188
You said he throws the ball well.

1630
01:54:26,438 --> 01:54:27,613
Yes, he always aims it down.

1631
01:54:27,813 --> 01:54:30,355
It's called basketball because you have 
to throw the ball in the basket above.

1632
01:54:30,480 --> 01:54:32,313
Is it possible to put the basket down?

1633
01:54:33,855 --> 01:54:34,438
Sir...

1634
01:54:34,938 --> 01:54:37,863
we've toured the entire 
Araku and reached the bank.

1635
01:54:38,063 --> 01:54:40,021
Now, you can deal with those 
Audit books however you like!

1636
01:54:40,105 --> 01:54:40,896
Sir...

1637
01:54:41,480 --> 01:54:42,588
I want to see all the ledgers.

1638
01:54:42,788 --> 01:54:43,896
I want to see all of it right now!

1639
01:54:43,938 --> 01:54:45,313
Did Suri give you the 
packet with money in it?

1640
01:54:45,513 --> 01:54:46,424
- Yes, sir. 
- Mommy!

1641
01:54:46,563 --> 01:54:47,891
But when I was eating 
Idly and set it aside,

1642
01:54:48,091 --> 01:54:49,467
someone mistook it for Idly 
parcel and took it away.

1643
01:54:49,771 --> 01:54:51,063
I am looking for him.

1644
01:54:51,230 --> 01:54:53,355
Don't worry, sir. 
I will search him out and find him.

1645
01:54:54,688 --> 01:54:55,480
What..?

1646
01:54:55,730 --> 01:54:56,905
What are you waiting here for?

1647
01:54:57,105 --> 01:54:58,155
I want to see your office right now.

1648
01:54:58,355 --> 01:54:59,921
I want to see those books in your office.

1649
01:55:00,121 --> 01:55:01,688
Talk to me? 
What is that blank face..?

1650
01:55:03,271 --> 01:55:04,646
You toured Araku.

1651
01:55:05,021 --> 01:55:06,396
Do you want to see Vizag?

1652
01:55:06,605 --> 01:55:09,938
Rushikonda, Sand, Dolphin...

1653
01:55:11,438 --> 01:55:13,321
Hail Hanuman! 
- Hail Hanuman!

1654
01:55:13,521 --> 01:55:15,021
See the road and drive carefully. 
- No, I won't.

1655
01:55:15,221 --> 01:55:16,980
I will appear. 
- Will you..?

1656
01:55:17,230 --> 01:55:18,313
Okay... come...

1657
01:55:18,396 --> 01:55:18,938
Come...

1658
01:55:20,188 --> 01:55:22,646
Lord Hanuman! 
Oh! You came to me..?

1659
01:55:22,688 --> 01:55:24,063
You and your foolish devotion!

1660
01:55:24,188 --> 01:55:25,780
How dare you blackmail a god?!

1661
01:55:25,980 --> 01:55:27,021
Are you going to watch 
the road or look at me?

1662
01:55:27,221 --> 01:55:27,571
I will keep looking at you.

1663
01:55:27,771 --> 01:55:28,855
Are you going to watch 
the road or look at me?

1664
01:55:29,055 --> 01:55:29,405
I will keep looking at you.

1665
01:55:29,605 --> 01:55:30,863
Hail Ram! Hail Hanuman! 
(singing)

1666
01:55:31,063 --> 01:55:32,446
Oh Lord Hanuman, you are also a devotee.

1667
01:55:32,646 --> 01:55:33,650
Are you going to watch 
the road or look at me?

1668
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:34,855
I will look at the road. 
I will look at the road.

1669
01:55:35,646 --> 01:55:36,438
Look at the road.

1670
01:55:37,271 --> 01:55:38,146
You Should look at the road only.

1671
01:55:38,346 --> 01:55:38,980
Oh Yes.

1672
01:56:05,980 --> 01:56:12,063
"His highness Gaali Sampath" 
"is my dear father."

1673
01:56:12,521 --> 01:56:19,230
"All the deeds my father is up to 
everyday. are beyond one's imagination."

1674
01:56:20,188 --> 01:56:23,896
"As soon as the cock crows in the morning, 
there is some problem or another."

1675
01:56:24,096 --> 01:56:27,396
"If he doesn't get those problems 
back home, he can't sleep a wink."

1676
01:56:27,596 --> 01:56:31,021
"He isn't at an age where 
he can be beaten, scolded or cajoled."

1677
01:56:31,221 --> 01:56:33,730
"How do I deal with him?"

1678
01:56:38,396 --> 01:56:40,563
"Crazy daddy and his gibberish"

1679
01:56:45,563 --> 01:56:48,605
"Crazy crazy crazy daddy 
and his gibberish."

1680
01:57:21,313 --> 01:57:25,396
"He is a chatter box that makes no sense. 
Boss of a useless gang"

1681
01:57:25,596 --> 01:57:28,938
"He is like the firework 
that goes all year round."

1682
01:57:29,138 --> 01:57:30,196
"Please, reign him in."

1683
01:57:30,396 --> 01:57:33,855
"Don't let him wander 
around about the town."

1684
01:57:35,771 --> 01:57:39,271
"He looks like he is always made up" 
"With a good moustache"

1685
01:57:39,471 --> 01:57:42,771
"This acting fanatic 
thinks he is Baahubali."

1686
01:57:42,971 --> 01:57:44,071
"Please be careful, son."

1687
01:57:44,271 --> 01:57:49,230
"You are the only one around him. 
So, keep watch."

1688
01:57:49,771 --> 01:57:53,196
"He is always high on energy."

1689
01:57:53,396 --> 01:57:56,355
"And uses it up on all 
the useless endeavor."

1690
01:57:58,947 --> 01:58:04,601
"Crazy daddy and his gibberish"

1691
01:58:06,129 --> 01:58:12,269
"Crazy crazy crazy daddy 
and his gibberish."
