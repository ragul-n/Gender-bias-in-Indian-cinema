1
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:17,283
Has Peter spoken yet?
- No, sir

2
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:25,130
Peter's deposition will be useful.
It'd help us to implicate...

3
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:31,596
Raja and Vikram. Only then will
Vikram's reign of terror end

4
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:35,739
What is this Peter made of?
First time in all my years...

5
00:01:36,042 --> 00:01:40,741
here's a man who refuses to speak
despite all the torture

6
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:45,549
Where is be?

7
00:01:47,354 --> 00:01:53,589
Peter, why don't you understand?
For your crimes, you could hang

8
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,590
And you did it for someone else.
Your silence will help Vikram escape

9
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:05,499
But you are going to hang for it
- But how could I?

10
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:07,138
Afraid of him?

11
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:16,548
Look Peter, only the law can save
you and your family

12
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:22,183
If you depose against Vikram,
the law will protect you

13
00:02:22,956 --> 00:02:26,790
He will hang, and you
will go free. Forever

14
00:02:27,093 --> 00:02:28,253
Free?

15
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:41,940
Now you have only one way out.
Help the law, and think of yourself

16
00:02:42,142 --> 00:02:48,047
Think of your family, think about
your wife, your own life! Think!

17
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,645
Yes!

18
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:59,350
I will depose against Vikram

19
00:03:05,165 --> 00:03:06,462
My dear doll

20
00:03:06,966 --> 00:03:09,093
In the boarding school,
you'll get a good education

21
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:12,896
And you'll come back a princess!
- I don't want to become a princess

22
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:17,634
I'm not going!
- You always listen to your brother

23
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:22,939
Yes, but not tbis one. I don't want
to go to the boarding school

24
00:03:25,585 --> 00:03:30,318
Hey folks, you know wbat
a darling sister my Pinky is?

25
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:33,916
First she will be stubborn, but then
she will do wbatever her brotber says

26
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:36,425
You will, won't you dear?
- No! I'm not your good sister

27
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:39,792
I won't go to tbe boarding school!
- But you must

28
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,867
But I don't want to.
- But you have to

29
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:43,999
Over here, please

30
00:03:44,637 --> 00:03:48,038
Take Pinky to the boarding school.
Go on, I'll go there to see you

31
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:51,235
No! I don't want to go

32
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:55,170
Brother, I don't want to go

33
00:03:58,885 --> 00:04:01,445
My sister is more precious to me
than my own life

34
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:06,416
The first girl in our family
in three generations

35
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,655
I have been a brother to her,
as I have also been a parent

36
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,132
Please take care of one thing

37
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:20,330
She must not feel the need
for anything

38
00:04:24,944 --> 00:04:26,844
Mr. Vikram, Peter has broken down

39
00:04:32,085 --> 00:04:33,609
Wbere is Raja?

40
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:33,977
Missed bim

41
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:49,718
All right Raja, you're a friend!
Don't kill me

42
00:06:50,423 --> 00:06:56,851
You care for me, don't you?
- No Peter. Tbis is a mean world

43
00:06:57,397 --> 00:06:59,797
No one cares for anyone

44
00:07:01,734 --> 00:07:03,258
You don't care eitber

45
00:07:38,404 --> 00:07:40,634
My condolences

46
00:07:42,575 --> 00:07:43,337
Let's go

47
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:02,821
Death is the only truth

48
00:08:03,596 --> 00:08:05,757
Peter had to die

49
00:08:08,401 --> 00:08:12,132
Raja, I need you

50
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,000
Raja, don't you ever become Peter

51
00:08:18,911 --> 00:08:22,039
You understand, don't you, Raja?

52
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:48,135
One Peter silenced.
But many more will be born

53
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:53,912
Name all your sons Peter.
For us, no problem

54
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,346
Remember one tbing, officer.
This is a mean world

55
00:08:58,851 --> 00:09:01,786
No one cares for anyone.
- But the two of you...

56
00:09:02,054 --> 00:09:06,457
you take care for each other.
For there are only two outcomes

57
00:09:06,859 --> 00:09:14,994
One, the four walls of the prison.
Two, the way Peter was dispatched

58
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:19,301
But the law reaches out
in many roads

59
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:25,770
Keep walking your road.
Wben you reach your destination...

60
00:09:26,312 --> 00:09:30,749
give yourself a pat on your back.
I'll be waiting for you

61
00:09:31,317 --> 00:09:32,477
Let's go Raja

62
00:10:07,119 --> 00:10:09,417
Stop... yes here

63
00:10:13,626 --> 00:10:14,718
There... on the top

64
00:10:48,527 --> 00:10:53,123
You try your luck at Raja's tables.
You don't play dirty

65
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,762
If I ever see you here again,
you're going home on a stretcber

66
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:02,771
Let's go

67
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:07,274
Come on, Sunil

68
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:32,260
This is a "no problem" house.
You'll live peacefully here

69
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:36,666
Come in

70
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,510
Look, such a big hall

71
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,210
Cute boy

72
00:11:41,013 --> 00:11:43,675
He can play cricket here,
or do somersaults

73
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,486
You can't get such a big ball
anywhere. And those are...

74
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:49,721
windows to The Heavens!
For fresh Mumbai air

75
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:55,994
The freshest air in Mumbai
is right here

76
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:57,159
Do you smell it?

77
00:11:57,396 --> 00:11:58,158
Yes

78
00:11:58,464 --> 00:11:59,692
The rest is no problem

79
00:12:01,467 --> 00:12:03,162
Smart kid

80
00:12:03,602 --> 00:12:04,398
Greetings

81
00:12:06,605 --> 00:12:10,268
Professor, there's something...
- The rent is decided, rigbt?

82
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:15,947
No problem, but for one in this area.
Raja... you've seen him?

83
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,587
He's a no-problem fellow as long as
no one comes in his way

84
00:12:23,155 --> 00:12:27,023
Civilized people tread a different
path. Besides, how are we concerned?

85
00:12:27,293 --> 00:12:30,956
That's the rigbt thing to say.
So you see, this is a no problem area

86
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:31,991
See you

87
00:12:32,631 --> 00:12:34,258
Haven't you been seeing
all the while?

88
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:37,527
Thank you, Mr. Bedi

89
00:12:37,803 --> 00:12:39,236
Bye

90
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,502
There he is

91
00:12:43,109 --> 00:12:47,375
Hey Bedi... come here.
- Hello!

92
00:12:47,947 --> 00:12:52,646
Any problems?
- Bedi, you're getting too smart

93
00:12:53,052 --> 00:12:55,577
You didn't even ask me before
letting the apartment out

94
00:12:55,855 --> 00:12:58,722
No!
- I've had a buncb all morning

95
00:12:59,058 --> 00:13:02,152
He's the one who's going
to get bashed today

96
00:13:02,461 --> 00:13:03,018
Shut up, you idiot

97
00:13:05,498 --> 00:13:10,902
Look Bedi, if it's a cop
or an old-timer...

98
00:13:11,203 --> 00:13:15,867
there's going to be hell to pay.
- No problem! He's a no-problem fellow

99
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:21,506
I inquired before I let tbe place out.
He's higbly educated. A professor

100
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,170
Teaches Hindi in a college.
- Tbat's nice

101
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:26,480
Professor?
- Yes. Famous man

102
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:30,721
Go get flowers from the store.

103
00:13:30,923 --> 00:13:35,622
And he's going to behave as if
he's doing the professor a favor

104
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:41,456
He'll say, "Here Professor,
your flowers. From Raja"

105
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:42,893
Tell him, Raja...
- Forget bim

106
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:46,965
I'd rather do the honors myself.
- If you go there...

107
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:50,673
I'll never get along with
the professor. Get lost

108
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:56,680
Go on Chaku, take the flowers.
And no idle talk

109
00:13:56,982 --> 00:13:58,108
Just say Raja bas sent these

110
00:13:58,751 --> 00:13:59,513
Who's Raja?

111
00:14:00,753 --> 00:14:04,052
Strange! You come to live in tbis area,
and you don't know Raja?

112
00:14:04,457 --> 00:14:05,651
That's tension

113
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,256
Oh yes, we know Raja

114
00:14:10,763 --> 00:14:16,326
You see, we aren't acquainted to Raja.
Nor have we done anything...

115
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:21,470
to deserve a welcome with flowers.
Anyway, please give him my thanks

116
00:14:22,942 --> 00:14:26,241
Wbat's my problem? I came here
because Raja told me to come

117
00:14:26,545 --> 00:14:28,410
Now you tell me to leave, I leave

118
00:14:29,482 --> 00:14:30,779
Tough cookie

119
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:32,844
Watch your step.
- I'm used to it

120
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:39,981
You reacted as if Raja
had sent you a bomb

121
00:14:40,292 --> 00:14:42,590
Getting friendly with strangers
in strange places...

122
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:46,056
What use acting unfriendly?
He's the local goon

123
00:14:46,665 --> 00:14:50,192
If not a friend, must you
make enemies with him?

124
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:57,040
Relationships should be such tbat
one is never ashamed to speak of

125
00:15:07,153 --> 00:15:08,643
Namaskar (Greetings)

126
00:15:09,221 --> 00:15:12,748
Namaskar. I am Raja

127
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,958
I am pleased to know your name.
What may I do for you?

128
00:15:17,229 --> 00:15:20,198
You sent back the flowers

129
00:15:20,499 --> 00:15:24,196
I do not deem it fit to accept gifts
from strangers

130
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:34,973
No problem. I came to know from Bedi
that you are a Professor

131
00:15:35,481 --> 00:15:40,441
So I thought I'd pay my regards
to such an educated man

132
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,252
Thank you, and nice to know tbat
you have regards for education

133
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:49,159
May I leave now?
I am getting late

134
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:11,948
Look at Raja's style!
- What a hero! What a dress!

135
00:16:12,218 --> 00:16:15,346
And he's ricb! He tips beggars
in bundreds

136
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:23,058
Everyone is scared of Raja.
- Someday, tbey will be scared of me

137
00:16:23,862 --> 00:16:27,127
Wby should they be scared of you?
- Because I'll become like Raja

138
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:28,355
I can fight like Raja

139
00:16:28,701 --> 00:16:29,258
Look

140
00:16:38,277 --> 00:16:42,213
Wbat is it Mummy?
- Come upstairs. Daddy is calling

141
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:43,073
Coming

142
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:08,158
Get up

143
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:16,164
Is be hurt?
- No. Come up

144
00:18:26,352 --> 00:18:30,812
Are you hurt? Are you all rigbt?
- Idiot! How many times...

145
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:33,115
have I told you not to play
with the kids on the street?

146
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:37,662
He can play only with children.
He's still a kid

147
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,626
Someday, we'll land in a big problem
because of this boy

148
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:44,063
Who?

149
00:18:49,808 --> 00:18:51,833
Wbat is it?
- Open up

150
00:19:04,723 --> 00:19:05,587
Yes?

151
00:19:05,858 --> 00:19:06,790
May I come in?

152
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:08,884
Yes, please

153
00:19:10,562 --> 00:19:12,723
But you baven't stated
your purpose

154
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:16,358
Down tbere, a man was killed
on the street

155
00:19:17,202 --> 00:19:19,932
After inquiries, we came to know
that your son...

156
00:19:20,205 --> 00:19:21,729
has seen the killer

157
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:26,473
No! My son bas seen nothing!
He wasn't there

158
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:29,111
Daddy, I saw everything.
I was there

159
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:42,923
Look Professor, we have taken
Raja and his men into custody

160
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:48,189
All your son needs to do,
is identify the man who sbot

161
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,228
But...
- Trust me

162
00:19:50,903 --> 00:19:55,363
I won't let your son come to harm.
Bring him over to the police station

163
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:18,158
One of these men shot that man

164
00:20:19,465 --> 00:20:21,592
Identify him. Is he the one?

165
00:20:22,234 --> 00:20:22,962
No

166
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,435
Say, is this tbe one?

167
00:20:47,926 --> 00:20:51,157
Now tell me son, be's the one,
isn't he?

168
00:21:07,913 --> 00:21:15,217
Now don't be afraid, son. Tell me.
Go on. Say it

169
00:21:15,554 --> 00:21:18,148
He's the one who shot tbat man,
isn't he? Tell me

170
00:21:18,457 --> 00:21:19,754
No, he isn't the one eitber

171
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:36,771
Once more, take a good look at him.
He is the one who sbot

172
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:38,836
Take a good look. Recognize him?

173
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:40,470
Pay attention

174
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:48,419
Excuse me, you are pressurizing
the boy. Your investigation is over

175
00:21:48,921 --> 00:21:49,649
Come on, Surya

176
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:52,412
Take off the handcuffs

177
00:22:03,569 --> 00:22:04,968
Everything's all right, Vikram

178
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:07,331
Lawyer...
- The bail bond

179
00:22:07,573 --> 00:22:08,835
Not necessary

180
00:22:09,374 --> 00:22:12,309
The Assistant Commissioner
suspected me. Not any more

181
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:17,080
Let's go, Raja

182
00:22:32,097 --> 00:22:35,760
God, I have lied. I know
telling lies is a sin

183
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:39,898
But I lied for Raja.
I adore bim

184
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:43,570
You are God.
Forgive me, please

185
00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:57,788
Long live Raja!
May you live a thousand years!

186
00:22:58,256 --> 00:23:04,217
Wbat are you doing? Raja's
birthday cake on my face?

187
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,430
Just to spare Raja tbe agony
of looking at your ugly face

188
00:23:08,834 --> 00:23:09,994
As it is, Raja has had
two close shaves...

189
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,302
one from that assassin and
then from the police

190
00:23:12,571 --> 00:23:16,063
Thanks to tbat kid.
- That kid gave Raja a second lease

191
00:23:16,408 --> 00:23:20,242
And thanks to him, we're celebrating
Raja's birthday

192
00:23:23,315 --> 00:23:27,149
One song for the occasion.
The same old one

193
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:17,161
"She invades my dreams"

194
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:22,469
"She steals all my sleep"

195
00:24:30,048 --> 00:24:35,418
"She invades my dreams
She steals all my sleep"

196
00:24:35,721 --> 00:24:40,658
"I'll shower all my love on her"

197
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:46,588
"I'll shower all my love on her
In my heart I bold her memories"

198
00:24:46,832 --> 00:24:53,067
"But where do I look for the one
who has taken my heart away?"

199
00:24:53,772 --> 00:25:00,177
"The one who has taken
my heart away"

200
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:35,402
"She looked as fresh as a blossom
She was as bright as the moon"

201
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:38,172
"Sbe'd dress up like a fairy queen
only for me"

202
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:43,921
"Tben she would steal into my heart"

203
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:51,853
"She looked as fresh as a blossom
She was as bright as the moon"

204
00:25:52,097 --> 00:25:54,565
"Sbe'd dress up like a fairy queen
only for me"

205
00:25:54,866 --> 00:25:59,963
"Tben she would steal into my heart"

206
00:26:00,305 --> 00:26:05,299
"She's the one this song is for"

207
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:11,012
"She's the one this song is for
For I can never forget her love"

208
00:26:11,249 --> 00:26:17,848
"The one who has taken
my heart away"

209
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:24,785
"Tbe one who has taken..."

210
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,560
"She sways like a peahen
There's a sparkle in her smile"

211
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:08,237
"I love the way she looks at me"

212
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,100
"Tbat swaggering youtbful doe
holds me spellbound"

213
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:13,970
"Oh, such colors of her youth"

214
00:27:18,817 --> 00:27:22,116
"She sways like a peahen
There's a sparkle in her smile"

215
00:27:22,387 --> 00:27:24,514
"I love the way she looks at me"

216
00:27:24,856 --> 00:27:27,324
"Tbat swaggering youtbful doe
holds me spellbound"

217
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:30,059
"Oh, such colors of her youth"

218
00:27:30,395 --> 00:27:35,264
"How do I quell
the ache in my heart?"

219
00:27:35,634 --> 00:27:40,970
"How do I quell the ache in my heart?
How do I express how I feel?"

220
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:46,971
"But where do I look for the one
who has taken my heart away?"

221
00:27:47,212 --> 00:27:48,702
"Tbe one who has taken..."

222
00:27:49,014 --> 00:27:53,883
"The one who has taken
my heart away"

223
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:57,551
"She invades my dreams"

224
00:27:57,822 --> 00:27:59,983
"She steals all my sleep"

225
00:28:00,325 --> 00:28:05,319
"I'll shower all my love on her"

226
00:28:05,697 --> 00:28:11,101
"I'll shower all my love on her
In my heart I bold her memories"

227
00:28:11,403 --> 00:28:17,808
"But where do I look for the one
who has taken my heart away?"

228
00:28:18,543 --> 00:28:24,880
"The one who has taken
my heart away"

229
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:51,135
My little angel

230
00:28:51,476 --> 00:28:54,138
Wby do I feel for you?

231
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:56,846
Do we share a bond?

232
00:28:57,182 --> 00:28:59,013
Kiddo, come on. Raja
wants to see you

233
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:02,844
My name isn't kiddo. My name is
Suryaprakash Vidyashankar Pande

234
00:29:03,154 --> 00:29:06,282
Your name isn't my problem.
Raja just told me, call that kid

235
00:29:06,524 --> 00:29:08,287
That's why I'm here.
Now come on. Please

236
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,091
Stop it now, how much
do you want to lose?

237
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:16,232
Luck isn't on your side today.
- Chhote, gambling is a game of nerves

238
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:19,028
Nothing to do with luck.
If you're scared of losing...

239
00:29:19,337 --> 00:29:21,601
you can never win.
The tables will turn

240
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:23,440
Deal

241
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,208
Not scared of me?

242
00:29:30,982 --> 00:29:32,609
I'm not scared of anyone

243
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:35,410
Want to make friends?

244
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:40,219
Wbat's your name?
- Suryaprakash Vidyashankar Pande

245
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:42,924
Goodness!

246
00:29:43,261 --> 00:29:47,891
Such a long name! Shortcuts allowed?
I'll call you Surya

247
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,292
Anything goes, pal

248
00:29:52,137 --> 00:29:53,126
Come over here

249
00:30:02,647 --> 00:30:04,137
This bid is for Surya

250
00:30:06,718 --> 00:30:10,051
I have an ominous feeling!
Watch it, you're going to lose

251
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:12,380
Abdul, just lock him up.
- Where?

252
00:30:12,657 --> 00:30:14,522
The loo, where else?
Watch it, or else...

253
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:16,054
Get lost

254
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:21,826
Show

255
00:30:31,543 --> 00:30:32,339
Now you

256
00:30:33,011 --> 00:30:34,444
Show, Surya

257
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,871
King! On first draw

258
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,178
Draw the second

259
00:30:42,153 --> 00:30:43,916
Second draw, Queen!

260
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,857
Show tbat ace

261
00:30:50,628 --> 00:30:52,061
Ace!

262
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:55,927
Saw that? The table turned

263
00:30:56,301 --> 00:30:59,998
This kid is lucky for you.
- First he saves me from that assassin

264
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:03,274
Then he saves me from the police.
Now he helped me make money

265
00:31:05,043 --> 00:31:06,738
Keep tbis, son

266
00:31:07,345 --> 00:31:08,039
Only so much?

267
00:31:08,813 --> 00:31:10,405
Smart

268
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:12,879
How much do you want?
- You won such a lot

269
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:13,982
And only a hundred for me?

270
00:31:14,786 --> 00:31:16,310
This one has it in him

271
00:31:18,723 --> 00:31:20,350
Keep this. Enjoy

272
00:31:21,226 --> 00:31:22,750
Go on now. See me later

273
00:31:26,297 --> 00:31:29,357
No Mummy, let it be. Please.
- It's dirty

274
00:31:30,935 --> 00:31:33,096
Wbat's inside your pocket?

275
00:31:36,808 --> 00:31:41,871
Surya... where did you get
so much money?

276
00:31:43,781 --> 00:31:45,009
It's my money

277
00:31:52,423 --> 00:31:55,790
Not even your father goes around with
that kind of money in his pockets

278
00:31:56,161 --> 00:31:58,425
Where did you get
this kind of money? Tell me

279
00:31:58,696 --> 00:31:59,628
I earned it

280
00:31:59,964 --> 00:32:04,401
Earned? Tell me, where did you
get so much money from? Tell me

281
00:32:04,702 --> 00:32:07,830
I helped Raja win a lot of money.
He gave me

282
00:32:08,206 --> 00:32:09,138
Good God!

283
00:32:10,341 --> 00:32:13,868
Have you been gambling, you rascal?
- I didn't play

284
00:32:14,145 --> 00:32:15,510
I just picked up Raja's cards

285
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:20,907
Raja! I must show bim his place!
Come with me. Come

286
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:23,683
Wbere are you going?
- To decide...

287
00:32:23,922 --> 00:32:26,390
who determines my son's future.
That goon or I

288
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:29,885
No! For God's sake, don't go there!
Something awful could happen!

289
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:35,861
Listen, why get into an argument with
hoodlums? Don't go there! Listen...

290
00:32:47,445 --> 00:32:49,072
Wbat's the matter, Professor?

291
00:32:50,281 --> 00:32:53,216
Surya, stand outside.
I'll be with you in a while

292
00:32:54,819 --> 00:33:00,257
Raja, you keep your ill-gotten gains.
This is what might inspire my son...

293
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:03,517
to follow in your footsteps.
You drew him into gambling

294
00:33:04,028 --> 00:33:06,019
And what will it be tomorrow?
Assassination?

295
00:33:06,431 --> 00:33:10,265
Wbat are you saying, Professor?
Your son is like my little brotber

296
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:12,192
I'd never lead him astray

297
00:33:13,338 --> 00:33:18,071
Those who live in filth cannot help
but taint others

298
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:22,040
I am trying to give my son
a good upbringing

299
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:26,474
Something your parents could
never give you. Your misfortune

300
00:33:26,951 --> 00:33:30,580
Professor, you have said enough

301
00:33:31,122 --> 00:33:33,215
And I have heard enough

302
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:36,950
Enough! Now get out of here

303
00:33:37,528 --> 00:33:39,792
Get out!
- Before I leave...

304
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:42,591
may I make something clear?
In future...

305
00:33:42,867 --> 00:33:46,325
stay away from my son.
This is my warning

306
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:49,630
No Raja!
- Don't

307
00:33:55,280 --> 00:34:00,308
Wby did you give my money away?
- You've no right to that money

308
00:34:00,752 --> 00:34:03,778
That money was ill gotten.
It came from bad people

309
00:34:04,055 --> 00:34:06,922
Raja isn't bad. He's he-man!
Everyone respects bim

310
00:34:07,258 --> 00:34:11,991
No. People are scared of him.
Because he's a hoodlum

311
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:16,059
And you will not talk to him.
- I will. For my money

312
00:34:16,334 --> 00:34:20,430
Surya, didn't I tell you?
We need no ill-gotten gains

313
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:22,869
It was my money. I earned it.
And I will have it

314
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:10,244
Listen... restrain yourself a bit.
He's just a baby

315
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:17,784
Such harshness might produce
the undesired result

316
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,165
His future is slipping
out of our hands, Sarita

317
00:35:23,901 --> 00:35:26,870
He is the only light in our lives

318
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:33,706
I am very afraid, Sarita!
I'm very afraid

319
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:41,917
I understand your feelings.
Do not worry

320
00:35:44,255 --> 00:35:49,750
With age, he will differentiate
between good and evil

321
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:12,615
I will go to get my money.

322
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:15,441
He bashes up his kid!

323
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:32,693
You think Raja is a hoodlum?

324
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:37,434
You say Raja's money is
III gotten? Speak up!

325
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,607
Bashes up his kid!

326
00:36:41,546 --> 00:36:45,744
Hey Professor! What have I done
to burt you?

327
00:36:46,684 --> 00:36:48,618
Come on, tell me

328
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:54,490
Raja paid you respects, said Namaskar!
Even sent you flowers

329
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:57,120
He bashes his kid!

330
00:36:58,129 --> 00:37:03,431
Hey professor, no one
cares for anyone

331
00:37:03,968 --> 00:37:08,598
But Raja loves your son

332
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:12,034
Because your son saved Raja's life

333
00:37:12,877 --> 00:37:14,538
And he bashed the kid!

334
00:37:16,581 --> 00:37:18,981
Aren't children godlike?

335
00:37:19,684 --> 00:37:24,383
Will God spare me
if I lead him astray?

336
00:37:25,022 --> 00:37:28,822
Tell me, Professor.
You're very learned, aren't you?

337
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:31,619
And he bashes the kid!

338
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:35,693
Why did you hit Surya?

339
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,770
Raja loves your son!
No one can burt him

340
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:44,368
And he bashed the kid!

341
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:50,980
You are no professor. You're no more
than a primary scbool teacher!

342
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,812
He bashes kids!

343
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,444
Bashes kids!

344
00:38:00,024 --> 00:38:01,719
You bashed your kid

345
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:12,168
This is your Raja

346
00:38:23,481 --> 00:38:25,745
Hey Surya! How did you get here?

347
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:28,645
I brought him here. He was insistent.
He wants to see you

348
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:37,254
Surya, I felt bad, you know. Last night
you took a beating because of me

349
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,257
I'm used to it. I get bashed
twice a day

350
00:38:39,564 --> 00:38:44,797
But I don't like it, Surya. Look,
no one cares for anyone out here

351
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:51,074
But I care for you. It makes me sad
to see you sad

352
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,469
Wby?
- Because I love you

353
00:39:01,118 --> 00:39:05,054
Hey Surya, you know wbat
I see in you? My cbildhood

354
00:39:05,856 --> 00:39:08,791
You've become a weakness for me.
Don't you leave me and go away

355
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,721
My father won't let me see you

356
00:39:13,764 --> 00:39:16,597
Hey, you don't say things like that.
You always wish your parents well

357
00:39:18,436 --> 00:39:25,342
One who doesn't have parents grows up
to become an evil man. Like me

358
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:27,176
Raja, are you crying?

359
00:39:47,665 --> 00:39:48,791
Namaste Professor

360
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:56,062
Surya, what are you doing here?
Come upstairs

361
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:14,286
Hey Raja, look at my muscles

362
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,354
Wow!
- Great?

363
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:17,857
Go on

364
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,761
Beat your Papa... try harder...!

365
00:40:26,504 --> 00:40:29,302
Papa lost!

366
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:41,982
Surya out! You're out

367
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:43,208
Raja, you always catch me out

368
00:41:02,273 --> 00:41:04,366
Beer

369
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:05,403
Bar closed

370
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:09,141
Beer, I told you. Beer, for everyone

371
00:41:09,413 --> 00:41:10,539
Bar is closed

372
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:14,410
Smart ass! Don't you hear?
I said beer for everyone

373
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,882
The bar is closed

374
00:41:19,724 --> 00:41:21,214
Let them have beer

375
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:25,654
You're smart

376
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:31,894
Make sure you're smart too.
There should be no problems here

377
00:41:58,262 --> 00:41:59,559
Don't you interfere

378
00:41:59,897 --> 00:42:00,886
And don't you budge

379
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:15,011
First, the bar was closed.
Now the doors are closed

380
00:42:17,114 --> 00:42:18,911
How are you going to get out?
- Like tbis

381
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:47,177
Hey! You don't interfere

382
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:30,586
Now you will compensate me
for the damages

383
00:43:33,257 --> 00:43:35,623
We'll settle the accounts later

384
00:44:00,684 --> 00:44:01,946
You come home

385
00:44:06,323 --> 00:44:13,525
Look Sarita! Today, he was fighting
for Raja! Just ask him, what's...

386
00:44:13,831 --> 00:44:17,733
the difference between them now?
- I did nothing wrong. Nor did Raja...

387
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:20,562
force me to do anything wrong.
- But of course!

388
00:44:20,905 --> 00:44:26,775
Raja can do nothing wrong! He's great!
He has influenced you so much that...

389
00:44:27,077 --> 00:44:32,276
you are trying to justify his actions!
- You only see his faults

390
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:34,107
The evident needs no debate

391
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:38,751
Sarita, someday tbis scoundrel
is going to disgrace us

392
00:44:42,693 --> 00:44:45,491
Wbere are you going?
- To be away! For a while

393
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:48,822
All the time, it's Raja and Raja
and how bad he is!

394
00:44:49,233 --> 00:44:51,701
How has Raja burt you?

395
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:53,995
Wbat's your enmity?

396
00:44:54,471 --> 00:44:56,098
How has he barmed you?

397
00:44:59,243 --> 00:45:04,044
He has made you shameless!

398
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:08,284
You defend a hoodlum like him
before your father?

399
00:45:09,586 --> 00:45:15,183
You have started accosting me!
He has spoilt my son!

400
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,656
You are mistaken

401
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:26,469
Stop him!

402
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,565
Stop

403
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,005
Prakasb...

404
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:37,908
Stop

405
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:38,907
I'll see you later

406
00:45:39,516 --> 00:45:41,848
Hey, you owe me money.
- I'll pay you up. Later

407
00:45:43,821 --> 00:45:46,551
Bloody...
- What's up? Are the cops after you?

408
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:49,622
No. It was Prakasb. On the run.
Were it not for your car...

409
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,725
I would've stripped him.
- In public?

410
00:45:54,164 --> 00:45:56,598
Shut up! It's been a month.
And he isn't paying me back

411
00:45:56,867 --> 00:45:59,165
Between friends, all is fair.
Come on, sit in the car

412
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:01,561
Wbere are you fellows beaded?
- Chowki Gully

413
00:46:01,872 --> 00:46:05,808
Not in the mood. Go on.
- Come on, we're just driving around

414
00:46:06,176 --> 00:46:09,009
We aren't going sbopping.
We'll look around, watch the girls

415
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:13,443
Over there, even asses smile.
- Just like him

416
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:18,947
Never mind. Go on.
- No way. You're coming

417
00:46:19,256 --> 00:46:19,881
All right

418
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:36,639
First, tbe jeans counter.
Let's take a look at some jeans

419
00:46:36,974 --> 00:46:40,102
I forgot my wallet, man!
Don't embarrass me

420
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:43,674
Happens

421
00:46:44,381 --> 00:46:47,680
Let me try that counter.
What class!

422
00:46:48,085 --> 00:46:50,144
Listen...
- Best of luck!

423
00:46:50,621 --> 00:46:54,079
Bore! Why are you wasting my time?
- In life, you got to take chances

424
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:55,848
You never know.
Now come on

425
00:46:56,627 --> 00:46:58,822
I'm not going anywhere.
- Forget bim

426
00:48:48,071 --> 00:48:52,064
So you're impressed?
- Not just impressed

427
00:48:52,676 --> 00:49:00,412
She's everywbere! I don't know what's
come over me ever since I saw her

428
00:49:04,521 --> 00:49:08,719
Happens. At this age,
this is what happens

429
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:14,426
Not happens, Raja. It's happened
for the first time ever

430
00:49:15,732 --> 00:49:19,133
You're finished, kiddo.
You're in love

431
00:49:19,603 --> 00:49:23,039
Love? I am in love?

432
00:49:23,307 --> 00:49:24,638
Yes

433
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:29,009
Is this wbat it feels like
to be in love?

434
00:49:29,713 --> 00:49:35,276
Yes kiddo.
Love is a beautiful feeling.

435
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,156
Lots of happiness and a little pain

436
00:49:45,128 --> 00:49:45,856
Raja...

437
00:49:46,296 --> 00:49:47,228
What happened?

438
00:49:48,632 --> 00:49:51,362
Nothing. What did you say
her name is?

439
00:49:51,635 --> 00:49:53,728
Name? I just saw ber
for the first time

440
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:56,664
I don't even know wbo she is
or where she lives

441
00:49:57,174 --> 00:49:58,835
I don't even know whetber
I'll see her ever again

442
00:49:59,476 --> 00:50:03,742
If tbis is destined,
you will see her again

443
00:50:04,081 --> 00:50:07,244
This time, make sure you ask for
her address first. Then her name

444
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:17,989
Aarti, where's Pinky?

445
00:50:18,295 --> 00:50:20,786
Pinky is coming.
But she's very angry with you

446
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:24,363
She went shopping with me,
then she called up all her friends

447
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:27,193
And now she's very angry.
She has locked herself in

448
00:50:38,582 --> 00:50:39,207
Understood

449
00:50:40,050 --> 00:50:45,454
Delicate situation, rigbt?
- Not delicate. Uncontrollable

450
00:50:45,822 --> 00:50:50,953
I'm not talking to you.
- You know, I drove at 150!

451
00:50:51,361 --> 00:50:53,921
Wbat if I had an accident?
- My brotber!

452
00:51:01,171 --> 00:51:03,162
Brother! You're in tears

453
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:05,806
You're in tears too

454
00:51:07,878 --> 00:51:11,780
You know, I stood first in college.
- I know everything

455
00:51:12,182 --> 00:51:15,549
That's wby I've decided
to send my sister to Oxford

456
00:51:15,952 --> 00:51:19,718
No! I'm not leaving you.
This is where I'm studying

457
00:51:20,023 --> 00:51:23,515
And this is my final decision!
- As long as I am alive, who are you...

458
00:51:23,827 --> 00:51:29,459
to take decisions about your life?
You will abide by my decisions

459
00:51:29,766 --> 00:51:31,996
Brother...!
- No more arguments

460
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:36,171
Vikram, at least hear Pinky out.
- Aarti, this is between us

461
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,843
Don't interfere. My decision is final.
For Pinky, studying in this city...

462
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:44,740
is out of question.
- Is this city dangerous for Pinky?

463
00:51:47,884 --> 00:51:52,287
In this city, wbo dares
look at my sister?

464
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:57,083
Raja, tell my brotber that.
- Don't you worry. You'll stay here

465
00:51:59,096 --> 00:52:02,395
In the shadow of relationships
men seek solace from sorrow

466
00:52:03,166 --> 00:52:08,229
A sister is a treasure. Why must
you send your sister far away?

467
00:52:08,538 --> 00:52:10,130
Brother, please

468
00:52:11,108 --> 00:52:11,938
All right

469
00:52:12,776 --> 00:52:17,941
Before he changes bis mind,
I must enroll in some college

470
00:52:18,248 --> 00:52:21,149
I won't go to that college!
Come what may

471
00:52:21,618 --> 00:52:25,850
Wbat's wrong with that college?
- It's Hitler's college

472
00:52:26,156 --> 00:52:31,093
My father is a professor over there.
In college, he's going to hound me!

473
00:52:32,028 --> 00:52:35,327
Surya, my son, you mustn't
speak like that of your fatber

474
00:52:35,799 --> 00:52:39,235
But he says, always speak tbe truth.
- Good God!

475
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:46,368
He's going to get even more angry
if you are so stubborn

476
00:52:48,011 --> 00:52:51,344
You know, just to make him
happy at heart...

477
00:52:51,648 --> 00:52:52,444
Heart?

478
00:52:53,784 --> 00:52:57,982
Does he have a heart at all?
- Hush! He might hear you

479
00:52:58,655 --> 00:53:02,284
Just go to college for a few days,
and see if you like it

480
00:53:02,626 --> 00:53:07,393
If you don't like it there, just
tell me. I'll bring him around

481
00:53:07,864 --> 00:53:11,561
Done with your consultations?
Wbat has your worthy son decided?

482
00:53:12,569 --> 00:53:16,164
Isis he going to college? Or would he
rather become a goon-on-the-streets?

483
00:53:16,506 --> 00:53:21,136
College...
- He's going. From tomorrow

484
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,943
If tbis is destined,
you will see her again

485
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:13,225
Traditionally, students acquaint
themselves with their teacher...

486
00:54:13,497 --> 00:54:17,991
before tbe education commences.
My name is Vidyasbanker Pande

487
00:54:18,401 --> 00:54:23,031
And my conviction is tbat
the relationship...

488
00:54:23,373 --> 00:54:25,136
between the student and the teacber
is like father and son

489
00:54:31,982 --> 00:54:32,949
Welcome

490
00:54:36,419 --> 00:54:37,579
Yes, you may sit there

491
00:54:38,788 --> 00:54:41,586
So I was talking about
making acquaintances

492
00:54:42,459 --> 00:54:45,656
Let's begin from bere. Your name?

493
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,126
Yours?

494
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:46,919
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

495
00:55:47,223 --> 00:55:51,626
"I find you exciting"

496
00:55:55,765 --> 00:55:59,701
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

497
00:56:00,036 --> 00:56:03,972
"I find you exciting"

498
00:56:04,341 --> 00:56:08,368
"Don't get cross, darling.
Let the world see"

499
00:56:08,712 --> 00:56:12,671
"I bave gone mad
At heart, I pine"

500
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:16,713
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

501
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:21,181
"I find you exciting"

502
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:25,426
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

503
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:29,697
"I find you exciting"

504
00:57:12,942 --> 00:57:16,878
"You look into my eyes"

505
00:57:17,147 --> 00:57:21,743
"And I am thunderstruck"

506
00:57:25,488 --> 00:57:29,720
"You look into my eyes"

507
00:57:30,093 --> 00:57:33,995
"And I am thunderstruck"

508
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:38,333
"I am intoxicated
I lost my senses"

509
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:42,536
"This is what love has led me into"

510
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:46,907
"Now only you rule my heart"

511
00:57:47,277 --> 00:57:51,043
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

512
00:57:51,414 --> 00:57:55,350
"I find you exciting"

513
00:57:55,752 --> 00:57:59,654
"Don't get cross, darling.
Let the world see"

514
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:03,857
"I bave gone mad
At heart, I pine"

515
00:58:04,294 --> 00:58:08,094
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

516
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:13,060
"I find you exciting"

517
00:58:49,472 --> 00:58:53,340
"Let me come closer"

518
00:58:53,743 --> 00:58:57,873
"Come, miss a few heartbeats"

519
00:59:01,851 --> 00:59:06,151
"Let me come closer"

520
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:10,424
"Come, miss a few heartbeats"

521
00:59:10,827 --> 00:59:18,962
"Don't you leave me on the lurch, love
Embrace me, my love"

522
00:59:19,402 --> 00:59:23,031
"This is a lovely season"

523
00:59:23,506 --> 00:59:27,442
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

524
00:59:27,844 --> 00:59:31,746
"I find you exciting"

525
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:36,107
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

526
00:59:36,486 --> 00:59:40,286
"I find you exciting"

527
00:59:40,723 --> 00:59:44,682
"Don't get cross, darling.
Let the world see"

528
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:48,929
"I bave gone mad
At heart, I pine"

529
00:59:49,332 --> 00:59:53,200
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

530
00:59:53,570 --> 00:59:57,472
"I find you exciting"

531
00:59:57,874 --> 01:00:01,674
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

532
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:06,013
"I find you exciting"

533
01:00:06,382 --> 01:00:10,284
"You are the one I want.
You are the one I love"

534
01:00:10,653 --> 01:00:15,147
"I find you exciting"

535
01:00:37,146 --> 01:00:39,706
Kiran! What a name!

536
01:00:40,516 --> 01:00:43,349
Surya and Kiran!
Wbat a combination!

537
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,552
Shut up

538
01:00:45,088 --> 01:00:47,318
Raja tell me, what should I do next?

539
01:00:47,857 --> 01:00:52,385
Talk to her. Strike up a friendship
- That's tougb. How to make friends?

540
01:00:52,695 --> 01:00:56,495
Hey Surya, you know any love song?
Stand in front of her and recite it

541
01:00:56,733 --> 01:01:02,569
After that you do on with
you are sixteen, your waist is twenty

542
01:01:02,805 --> 01:01:08,710
You are sixteen, your waist is twenty
Fair maiden what dish you are!

543
01:01:09,112 --> 01:01:12,275
My love! Come into my arms

544
01:01:12,715 --> 01:01:15,741
My heart is left empty
for you to steal in

545
01:01:15,985 --> 01:01:16,610
Sbut up!

546
01:01:16,986 --> 01:01:18,749
Look Surya, her name
is Kiran, isn't it?

547
01:01:20,223 --> 01:01:24,250
Give her a fast number.
Like, "You're mine, Kiran"

548
01:01:24,527 --> 01:01:25,687
I can't do all tbat

549
01:01:27,196 --> 01:01:28,094
Wait a minute

550
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:51,982
Take tbis

551
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:00,621
What's this, Raja?

552
01:02:02,765 --> 01:02:06,667
A matter of the heart.
Reaches there

553
01:02:06,769 --> 01:02:10,398
"Not all the books in the world
will make a man wise"

554
01:02:10,873 --> 01:02:16,004
"Love is a small word which
encompasses a world of wisdom"

555
01:02:17,246 --> 01:02:23,617
Kabir says love is all-important.
Everywbere in the world...

556
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:29,023
poets and authors have written
volumes about love

557
01:02:32,962 --> 01:02:37,797
I've written a poem on love too. May I
have your permission to read it out?

558
01:02:38,267 --> 01:02:39,063
You?

559
01:02:40,536 --> 01:02:43,937
May I have your permission?
- Yes. Read it

560
01:02:49,512 --> 01:02:52,413
Yes, with you I have this relationsbip

561
01:02:53,616 --> 01:02:56,676
Yes, with you I have this relationsbip

562
01:02:57,954 --> 01:03:03,893
As eyes to dreams; as breath to life

563
01:03:04,827 --> 01:03:09,855
Like a beautiful dream I found you
standing at strange crossroads

564
01:03:10,233 --> 01:03:13,999
And I followed your footsteps

565
01:03:14,604 --> 01:03:17,869
My goals forgotten,
my promises broken

566
01:03:18,174 --> 01:03:22,338
Yes, with you I have this relationsbip

567
01:04:57,507 --> 01:04:59,441
Mummy, there goes my deck!

568
01:05:02,345 --> 01:05:06,839
So Mr. Randhir Kanojia,
Gogi Pathan has grabbed your land

569
01:05:07,617 --> 01:05:11,883
And not just tbat land.
I hold your fate hostage

570
01:05:12,522 --> 01:05:16,390
You can't get that plot back.
You may leave

571
01:05:20,329 --> 01:05:22,923
We didn't come here to leave
just like that

572
01:05:23,533 --> 01:05:28,835
We're here to make you see reason.
That plot isn't yours. Get off it

573
01:05:29,205 --> 01:05:32,140
I have bought that plot.
You understand Pathan?

574
01:05:32,475 --> 01:05:34,943
Don't you try to make my brotber
to understand things! Get it?

575
01:05:35,278 --> 01:05:38,441
Shut up. Else you and your brother
are both dead

576
01:05:39,515 --> 01:05:41,107
Are you threatening Lattu Pathan?

577
01:05:41,517 --> 01:05:43,610
I could blast you from
the face of this earth

578
01:05:45,955 --> 01:05:49,152
Gogi, you better make your brother
see reason. He's talking too much

579
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:16,513
Abdul! Karim! Rahim!
Where are you fellows?

580
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:18,712
Hurry up! Over here!

581
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:52,587
Randhir! Are you all rigbt?
- Take bim to the hospital

582
01:06:55,091 --> 01:07:01,155
Really? She smiled at you?
- Not at me. She smiled at my poem

583
01:07:01,697 --> 01:07:04,632
She heard the poem, and there
was a smile on her lips

584
01:07:04,934 --> 01:07:07,767
Get this. You're through!
- Hundred percent

585
01:07:08,070 --> 01:07:11,301
Wben a girl smiles...
- She has fallen

586
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:14,873
How come? She doesn't even know
that I love her

587
01:07:15,411 --> 01:07:17,777
I have one solid idea

588
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:22,617
But you got to have the liver
to pull it off... I mean guts

589
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:27,019
My heart's gone. I'll stake my liver,
my kidneys, my guts and my what-not

590
01:07:27,290 --> 01:07:33,991
Just give me that idea.
- Just accost her. And tell her

591
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:37,461
Will you stand in for me if she tries
to beat me witb her slippers?

592
01:07:37,867 --> 01:07:41,268
There, he chickens out

593
01:07:41,937 --> 01:07:44,201
Want me to sbow you how?
- Sbow

594
01:07:50,513 --> 01:07:51,207
One minute

595
01:07:57,987 --> 01:07:59,750
The same eyes!

596
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:05,186
The same lungs... lips!

597
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:09,320
Sister, you look just like my sister

598
01:08:09,598 --> 01:08:10,462
Sister?

599
01:08:13,002 --> 01:08:15,630
My sister died sixteen years ago

600
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,674
She'd be your age

601
01:08:21,410 --> 01:08:23,105
Maybe sixty or seventy

602
01:08:24,246 --> 01:08:25,804
Sixteen or seventeen

603
01:08:26,982 --> 01:08:30,816
I used to love ber very much!
That's why I stopped you

604
01:08:31,754 --> 01:08:34,689
May I call you my sister?

605
01:08:35,324 --> 01:08:39,818
Sister? You want me for a sister?

606
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:41,925
Then you are my brother

607
01:08:43,933 --> 01:08:46,231
Oh, I'm feeling like crying!

608
01:08:46,869 --> 01:08:48,632
Wbat's there to cry about?

609
01:08:59,749 --> 01:09:01,774
Wow! What a show!

610
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:06,853
Saw that?
- Great!

611
01:09:07,123 --> 01:09:11,059
You're tbe boss!
- Chakku is great!

612
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:13,459
He won't take a batb for ten days!

613
01:09:13,963 --> 01:09:14,895
Accepted man

614
01:09:15,865 --> 01:09:18,231
She got emotional when
I said "I love you"

615
01:09:19,402 --> 01:09:24,396
It was tough reasoning with her.
She wanted to marry me right away

616
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:26,231
Wbat are you saying?
- Right away!

617
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,537
Wbat if Kiran doesn't turn out
to be like that?

618
01:09:31,881 --> 01:09:35,612
Right. Some girls get angry
in no time

619
01:09:36,318 --> 01:09:39,651
Now stop chewing my brains

620
01:09:41,424 --> 01:09:43,892
I have another idea.
- Go on

621
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:45,991
All-time hit

622
01:10:03,212 --> 01:10:05,146
Excuse me, we're playing

623
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:08,779
We want to play too.
- Let us finish our game first

624
01:10:09,485 --> 01:10:10,975
How about playing with us?

625
01:10:13,622 --> 01:10:15,852
If she looks so pretty
when sbe's angry...

626
01:10:16,258 --> 01:10:18,726
what'd she look like
when sbe's making love?

627
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:25,463
Hey! Let go of that girl

628
01:10:26,202 --> 01:10:27,260
Who the hell is it?

629
01:10:27,536 --> 01:10:28,594
I told you. Let go of that girl

630
01:10:28,971 --> 01:10:31,030
Babyface, you want to play hero?
You'll get bashed up

631
01:10:31,474 --> 01:10:34,602
Get lost, smart ass

632
01:10:34,977 --> 01:10:38,777
After we're through with you,
you mother won't recognize you

633
01:10:39,081 --> 01:10:39,945
Got it?

634
01:10:55,664 --> 01:10:57,529
Now I'm going to break
your baby face

635
01:10:57,800 --> 01:10:58,858
Not hard!

636
01:11:00,836 --> 01:11:02,770
See this?

637
01:11:03,072 --> 01:11:04,004
Step back

638
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:06,765
Everyone... hey you in tbat
red shirt... back out

639
01:11:07,042 --> 01:11:08,805
See this? Someone's going to die

640
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:11,005
Don't spare this one
- I won't

641
01:11:12,948 --> 01:11:14,813
They're going to kill Surya

642
01:11:15,417 --> 01:11:16,475
Somebody! Help!

643
01:11:16,752 --> 01:11:17,946
Kill him!
- Killing... wait

644
01:11:19,288 --> 01:11:20,482
Sbut up!

645
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:24,451
Trying to act smart?

646
01:11:25,761 --> 01:11:26,728
Wbo did that?

647
01:11:30,766 --> 01:11:32,666
No one moves

648
01:11:32,935 --> 01:11:33,867
See this?

649
01:11:34,403 --> 01:11:37,395
Chakku! Let's get out of here

650
01:11:37,806 --> 01:11:40,297
Someone wants to get killed?

651
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:42,835
Don't! Don't you move!
I'm warning you

652
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:44,407
Run!

653
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,067
Surya! It's me! Chakku!

654
01:12:08,938 --> 01:12:11,873
Tell them! We're friends!

655
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:20,841
This bargain didn't include
getting lynched

656
01:12:22,451 --> 01:12:25,181
Say it! When will you say it?
After we're dead?

657
01:12:26,255 --> 01:12:27,984
Enough

658
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:34,928
They are my friends.
No one touches them

659
01:12:56,051 --> 01:12:59,919
So you wanted to impress me
with your heroics?

660
01:13:06,495 --> 01:13:08,429
And I can prove it

661
01:13:19,908 --> 01:13:22,502
Don't scream. You aren't dying yet.
- Hurts. I took a bad one

662
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:24,768
Are you trying to teach him
how to become a hooligan?

663
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,408
Didn't I tell you to keep him
out of tbis business?

664
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:29,708
Wbat could we do? He...

665
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:36,124
And you... you want to become
a hooligan?

666
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:39,461
And once again, your fatber
accuses me

667
01:13:39,695 --> 01:13:41,094
Why did you have to do
what they said?

668
01:13:41,730 --> 01:13:44,358
I'll never make that mistake again.
Please forgive me, Raja

669
01:13:46,535 --> 01:13:51,302
Eventually, I will. But will she
forgive you? Will she trust you?

670
01:13:51,573 --> 01:13:58,809
I have one solid idea. How about
a bit of drama? To draw her out

671
01:13:59,048 --> 01:14:00,106
Abdul...
- Yes Raja?

672
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:02,078
Lock him up in his loo.
- Come on

673
01:14:02,618 --> 01:14:05,143
One good idea... no I haven't any

674
01:14:06,321 --> 01:14:10,087
Look, you go and see her
and you apologize. Patch up

675
01:14:10,526 --> 01:14:13,586
How can I? Tomorrow she's going
for the college picnic

676
01:14:13,796 --> 01:14:16,287
You go along too.
- And wbat do I do? Walk?

677
01:14:16,632 --> 01:14:18,862
Ask for a hundred bucks, and Hitler
has a thousand questions

678
01:14:20,302 --> 01:14:21,792
Use this

679
01:14:22,438 --> 01:14:25,202
But Raja...
