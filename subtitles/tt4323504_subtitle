1
00:01:53,035 --> 00:02:00,251
"
A story began to purr again..."

2
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:07,800
"
Dawn color can be seen in the eyes."

3
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,596
"
Distances seem much closer."

4
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:15,475
"
Love is just for lucky few."

5
00:02:15,976 --> 00:02:22,107
"It's a new color in the air."

6
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:30,031
"
Heart of fools was arranged again."

7
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:37,664
"Looking problems."

8
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:45,173
"
To dive in the grip of feelings."

9
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:52,805
"Here I am... Here it is."

10
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:56,642
"There it is again..."

11
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,750
Mom, I have a
beat Aditi.

12
00:03:11,909 --> 00:03:13,202
And I want to win this race.

13
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,828
Only then can stay with Nirvana.

14
00:03:15,287 --> 00:03:16,497
Nirvan? Who's that?

15
00:03:16,955 --> 00:03:17,915
It's very nice.

16
00:03:18,373 --> 00:03:19,792
But stay with Aditi.

17
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,462
No wonder that're so
Dorn was a defeat Aditi.

18
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,299
You know, it saw Riya on Aditi and her mother
training himself.

19
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:29,385
And they run very fast.

20
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:32,054
No problem, and you're
a fast runner.

21
00:03:32,596 --> 00:03:35,724
And by the way, I was ºtafeta
team of my school too.

22
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:39,185
- Yes...
- Sorry, Mom, this is a race.

23
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:41,022
Not a case on
that you always gain it.

24
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:43,358
Excuse me, young lady, you better care
.

25
00:03:43,858 --> 00:03:47,320
- Ok.
- Take care.

26
00:03:47,862 --> 00:03:49,114
Pa.

27
00:03:49,614 --> 00:03:52,575
Dra. Sanaya Verma,
not you forgotten something?

28
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:56,371
Oh yes...

29
00:03:57,997 --> 00:04:01,000
- I love you.
- And I love you. See you later, okay.

30
00:04:01,543 --> 00:04:04,879
- Goodbye.
- Bye. See you later.

31
00:04:10,385 --> 00:04:11,345
Yes, Mr. Parmar.

32
00:04:11,595 --> 00:04:14,765
Lady, today's final hearing in the case of Abbas
at 11.

33
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:18,602
Thank you.
I'll be there.

34
00:04:23,232 --> 00:04:26,569
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

35
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,367
- Ready?
- Always.

36
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:40,416
I wish... these high heels help you earn
case.

37
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:43,503
- Play some games today?
- No.

38
00:04:44,004 --> 00:04:46,465
It seems that you lost.

39
00:04:46,965 --> 00:04:50,302
Raise your .

40
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:57,684
Honorable court, my client is a well-known journalist
historical.

41
00:04:58,185 --> 00:05:00,145
Extortion... kidnapping... Assault!

42
00:05:00,645 --> 00:05:02,064
She accused each type of crime...

43
00:05:02,564 --> 00:05:04,483
And to and spent time in prison for it.

44
00:05:04,524 --> 00:05:06,610
That was his past.

45
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:10,155
But today... he pays a price for his past
.

46
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:14,827
Honorable court, that's an open and shut case
pure extortion.

47
00:05:15,286 --> 00:05:16,329
It could
Mr. Prosecutor...

48
00:05:16,704 --> 00:05:19,373
Farms only if you have evidence that prove it.

49
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:22,460
That so called 'Dictaphone'
that you've mentioned repeatedly...

50
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:22,919
Where is it?

51
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:25,838
It was smart
stolen from the police station.

52
00:05:26,297 --> 00:05:27,924
Forget where you reach
with that, Mr. Prosecutor!

53
00:05:28,257 --> 00:05:29,759
Police 's you, not me.

54
00:05:30,176 --> 00:05:32,887
And for this we
written statement to Police.

55
00:05:33,346 --> 00:05:35,848
And unfortunately... this can not be accepted
, honorable court.

56
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:37,934
They have no proof, honorable court.

57
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:39,435
This is pure harassment.

58
00:05:39,894 --> 00:05:41,813
This case must be rejected.

59
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,068
Accused Abdul Razaq  Abbas...

60
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:50,656
Guilty.

61
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:51,573
Congratulations.

Lawyer  Verma... congratulations.

64
00:05:56,036 --> 00:05:56,995
We won.

65
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,497
Not us, you...

66
00:05:58,997 --> 00:06:01,083
You won,
Abbas. Congratulations.

67
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,502
Abbas may have many faults...

68
00:06:03,961 --> 00:06:05,462
But he always rãsplãteºte a favor.

69
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:08,006
Do not hesitate to call... if you ever need me
.

70
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,716
- I'll be there.
- Never.

71
00:06:10,217 --> 00:06:11,301
If you believe in prayer...

72
00:06:11,802 --> 00:06:13,930
Pray then
no we never met.

73
00:06:14,347 --> 00:06:16,433
Never?

74
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,227
Life is very strange, Ms. Verma.

75
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:24,232
What happened yet...
will happen once.

76
00:06:24,691 --> 00:06:25,650
- Here.
- What is this?

77
00:06:26,109 --> 00:06:29,446
Gift for you.

78
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,242
It could be jailed for five years for this.

79
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:35,744
How did you get this?

80
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,912
Everything has a price, Abbas.

81
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:41,750
You just have to know who... and how?

82
00:06:50,384 --> 00:06:55,139
Inspector  Yohaan, your image and attitude
Mare B will not work here.

83
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:58,559
I'd expect to tropaiesc
around that Singh?

84
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:00,895
There are serious allegations of corruption against you.

85
00:07:01,062 --> 00:07:03,481
You need to have your say What is corruption?

86
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:05,900
Money attracts money.

87
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:09,904
Money become more money.

88
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:11,989
And so is yours today, tomorrow's...

89
00:07:12,448 --> 00:07:13,991
And God knows who you... day after tomorrow.

90
00:07:14,158 --> 00:07:15,660
Who can understand the nature of money...

91
00:07:16,119 --> 00:07:17,579
Better than you, sir ROKR.

92
00:07:17,614 --> 00:07:19,081
Type your lost everything.

93
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,625
You're in a big trouble now.

94
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,836
Small problems are not my cup of tea anyway
, Mr. ROKR.

95
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:27,005
And as long as that manager is interested... Udipi

96
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:29,049
Then let me have your simple
a question.

97
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:30,926
How many times have we been decorated...

98
00:07:31,384 --> 00:07:33,845
And they were awarded medals of Police
?

99
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:36,473
3-4 times... but that does not make any difference
.

100
00:07:36,932 --> 00:07:39,434
Face, sir ROKR.

101
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,812
You have chosen to believe a modest restaurant manager...

102
00:07:42,104 --> 00:07:44,356
Instead of a decorated officer.

103
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:46,442
Even his lens reeked of kerosene.

104
00:07:46,567 --> 00:07:47,902
He accepted ...

105
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:52,407
Receive kickbacks in your favor.

106
00:07:52,907 --> 00:07:57,787
What if I say that I agree to the benefit Commissioner
bribe?

107
00:07:58,246 --> 00:07:59,705
What will you do? Arrest him!

108
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:02,500
Keep
cheap to have your arguments in court.

109
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,337
I'm suspended.
With immediate effect.

110
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:17,224
You sc **** careers really sweetheart.

111
00:08:17,725 --> 00:08:19,226
All the blame is yours.

112
00:08:19,727 --> 00:08:20,436
Do you disappeared forever, Yohaan.

113
00:08:20,894 --> 00:08:22,646
This time we have a strong case against you.

114
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,857
I know... you will not play
never lose a game.

115
00:08:25,232 --> 00:08:27,317
It will be a warrant raid
against you in two days.

116
00:08:27,484 --> 00:08:31,238
There is a way... to save you.

117
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:33,031
Continuous listening.

118
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,033
The others will not budge under five ..

119
00:08:35,492 --> 00:08:37,327
But I convinced that Yohaan
's one of us.

120
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:39,420
If we do not help him,
who else will?

121
00:08:39,455 --> 00:08:41,457
Turns out the words...
scattered say get your price.

122
00:08:41,498 --> 00:08:44,084
15 million... just for you.

123
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,086
- 15 million...?
- Yes.

124
00:08:46,587 --> 00:08:53,094
I fish for alms myself
how I organize a feast for you?

125
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:56,765
So how would you know to get...
you have to learn to give.

126
00:08:57,265 --> 00:08:58,641
You have no monopoly on bribery.

127
00:08:59,184 --> 00:09:02,479
Alone.

128
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,529
15 million.

129
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,699
They all  same goal here.

130
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,705
They greet all of Bapu
de1000 rupees banknotes.

131
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:24,251
This time you disappeared forever, Yohaan.

132
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,089
Jai Hind !

133
00:09:30,424 --> 00:09:32,176
Mr. Parmar, such
were your nights?

134
00:09:32,676 --> 00:09:33,803
You got Shilajeet original.

135
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:34,762
Tell me
I will bring to you.

136
00:09:35,262 --> 00:09:36,433
Look, Mr. Yohaan,
was said and logged before...

137
00:09:36,434 --> 00:09:37,498
Lady is busy.

138
00:09:37,598 --> 00:09:38,516
- Yes.
- But I'm free.

139
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:40,393
Mr. Yohaan, exceeds the limit.

140
00:09:40,851 --> 00:09:42,812
Not at all, I'm going.

141
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:44,688
Mr. Parmar, it's ok.

142
00:09:45,189 --> 00:09:46,006
I'm almost done here.

143
00:09:46,065 --> 00:09:47,191
- Scuzaþi us.
- Yes Mrs.

144
00:09:47,274 --> 00:09:47,817
- Thank you.
- Yes Mrs.

145
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,486
Tell him about Shilajeet?

146
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:51,071
- Please...
- Go out!

147
00:09:51,571 --> 00:09:54,074
Pa.

148
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:56,118
- How's Sanaya?
- It's good.

149
00:09:56,576 --> 00:09:58,161
I miss you.

150
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,372
we know each other during school.

151
00:10:00,872 --> 00:10:01,832
Right?

152
00:10:01,998 --> 00:10:03,542
You Advisor class I used to be...

153
00:10:03,917 --> 00:10:05,168
And we were supuºii row.

154
00:10:05,335 --> 00:10:06,586
And you still get into trouble...

155
00:10:07,087 --> 00:10:10,298
- We fight, but we were friends.
- Still we are.

156
00:10:10,757 --> 00:10:11,842
So... what's that?

157
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,095
Anu, this time I made it
sheep.

158
00:10:15,554 --> 00:10:16,638
People from Anti-Corruption
and gathered across on me...

159
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:18,975
And certainly will be suspended.

160
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,769
Poth Îþi imagine...
Yohaan inspector, sacked?

161
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,438
It's a good thing if you are dismissed.

162
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,480
People will feel safe.

163
00:10:24,939 --> 00:10:26,023
Do people just criminals.

164
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:26,739
If I take one day free,

165
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:27,650
Her as if celebrating Eid-i
(end festival).

166
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,193
Last time I was put down with Dengue (fever)...

167
00:10:29,235 --> 00:10:30,361
And they celebrated as if it was Diwali.

168
00:10:30,445 --> 00:10:32,113
Even if they are your best friend...

169
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,073
's Hard to say if
're honest or corrupt.

170
00:10:34,323 --> 00:10:37,160
There are corrupt.
ROKR asked me to receive on behalf of 15 million.

171
00:10:37,618 --> 00:10:39,036
If you analyze corruption in the Police ..

172
00:10:39,203 --> 00:10:40,378
There are far below the poverty line.

173
00:10:40,413 --> 00:10:42,081
- 15 million.
- So you're not corrupt.

174
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,834
The whole system is corrupt bastard. - Yes.

175
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:46,753
Bribe of 100 rupees is offered.

176
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:48,546
And 10 million is considered bribery.

177
00:10:48,755 --> 00:10:50,507
works.

178
00:10:50,966 --> 00:10:52,259

You can not follow a simple instruction
to save your daughter's life?

235
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:03,810
Where should I go?

236
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,314

237
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:13,612

00:15:14,071 --> 00:15:15,822
These policemen have nothing to do with it.

239
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:18,116
Rid of them.

I have money with me.

300
00:18:57,676 --> 00:18:58,886
Do not worry about money.

301
00:18:59,344 --> 00:19:00,305
I do not understand.

302
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:02,891
Ms. Verma, who is your opinion about the sentence
death?

303
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,018
How is this related to Sanaya?

304
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,021
A man was sentenced to death by the court.

305
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:09,481
It's innocent.

306
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:10,607
I was framed.

307
00:19:11,065 --> 00:19:12,317
Appealed in the High Court.

308
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,195
I want to defend the case and to save him.

309
00:19:15,695 --> 00:19:17,989
I want to go free, Ms. Verma.

310
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,158
Call date is next Wednesday...

311
00:19:20,658 --> 00:19:21,743
So you have only four days.

312
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:25,455
- You only four days.
- What?

313
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:27,290
If you do not pay Poth...

314
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,584
You will not have your daughter ever see.

315
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,712
Wait a minute.

316
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,839
I want proof...

317
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,425
My daughter is alive and unharmed, or not?

318
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,262
Okay, give me five minutes.

319
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:09,835
- Hello, Mr. Parmar.
- Yes.

320
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,128
It's an emergency.

321
00:20:11,586 --> 00:20:15,132
A new case.

322
00:20:15,674 --> 00:20:17,092
Art student of 23 years, Siya...

323
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,059
Was reported missing from home.

324
00:20:19,094 --> 00:20:21,096
A milkman noticed blood dripping from beneath the door...

325
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:22,681
And called Police.

326
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,808
15 days later, the body Siya...

327
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:28,103
Was found in a pond under
Vashi Bridge.

328
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:30,814
That means the killer
Siya killed at her home...

329
00:20:31,148 --> 00:20:33,359
And I threw
body under Vashi Bridge.

330
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,487
What is surprising is that the murderer was arrested immediately
.

331
00:20:36,988 --> 00:20:38,781
Just two days after the body was found
you.

332
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,408
Let's go... stop pretending.

333
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,868
According to these reports, Niyaz...

334
00:20:42,285 --> 00:20:44,871
Was convicted five times for rape and violence.

335
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:47,039
Come on... let go...

336
00:20:47,582 --> 00:20:49,709
Foot prints and traces found at the crime scene...

337
00:20:50,126 --> 00:20:51,878
I belong to.

338
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:54,881
Siya's wallet, which was recovered from his room
Niyaz...

339
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:59,510
Stained with blood and his fingerprints Siya
Niyaz.

340
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:01,345
On the basis of the evidence against him...

341
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:03,140
Was sentenced to death.

342
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:05,642
And
appealed against the sentence in the High Court.

343
00:21:05,677 --> 00:21:06,602
The hearing's in three days.

344
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:08,020
We have very little time...

345
00:21:08,187 --> 00:21:09,980
- And I want the whole history of the victim.
- Yes.

346
00:21:10,189 --> 00:21:12,441
Who conducted the autopsy? - Dr. Satish.

347
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:14,818
- And the officer in charge?
- Yohaan inspector.

349
00:21:17,029 --> 00:21:19,406

- But the lady just took that case.

350
00:21:19,441 --> 00:21:20,741

- Yes.

351
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:23,952
Anu take Niyaz's case. - Yes.

352
00:21:24,411 --> 00:21:25,996
Curses.

353
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:27,873
- Listen... Parmar.
- Yes.

354
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,793
Îþi will bring the best Shilajeet

355
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,045
Anu convinces her to take my case.

356
00:21:33,588 --> 00:21:35,757
Slowing your and my career will both be safe.

357
00:21:36,257 --> 00:21:36,674
Wait.

358
00:21:37,092 --> 00:21:40,470
Inspector  Yohaan.

359
00:21:42,806 --> 00:21:44,641
Inspector  Yohaan.

360
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:45,892

Hello, Anu.

372
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:21,762
People from Anti-Corruption
are after me.

373
00:22:22,221 --> 00:22:23,597
They have issued a warrant against me.

374

377
00:22:27,893 --> 00:22:29,019
's A murderer and a rapist.

378
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,771
All the evidence is against him.
He will be sentenced to death.

379
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,356
Just tell me what you know.

380
00:22:32,857 --> 00:22:35,068
Her mother is a teacher,
father was entertainment.

00:22:35,527 --> 00:22:37,320
They despãrþit. May
later, her father died.

382
00:22:37,362 --> 00:22:38,572
Siya was their only child.

383
00:22:38,947 --> 00:22:40,657
And as far as I know, they have no kin.

384
00:22:41,116 --> 00:22:43,493
Listen... just take his case?

385
00:22:43,994 --> 00:22:44,995

Okay... then tell me

It will spar me where?

390
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,854
It's a very successful lawyer.

391
00:23:09,979 --> 00:23:11,606
At least you will not be sentenced to death.

392
00:23:12,106 --> 00:23:14,692
But you said I'll save.

393
00:23:15,151 --> 00:23:17,361
And you've asked to

Then you asked me to exchange

396
00:23:21,365 --> 00:23:22,909
Take me stupid?

397
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,327
Who is someone in town...

398
00:23:24,786 --> 00:23:29,040
Lawyer wants to Verma to defend the case.

399
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:35,588
These beautiful faces...
not win cases.

400
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,633
Advocates  încãpãþânaþi that you do.

401
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:39,051
Do you understand this, old man?

402
00:23:39,343 --> 00:23:42,262
I'll make sure winner!

403
00:23:42,721 --> 00:23:46,850
Believe me!

404
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:48,644
Niyaz... what?

405
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:50,771
Will you save death sentence.

406
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,899
- You've seen?
- Niyaz.

407
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:56,443
Will you save.

Do not leave me, avocatule.

409
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,949
I have not killed anyone.

410
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:17,841
What is it?

411
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:22,178
I told you already that my daughter

412
00:24:22,637 --> 00:24:24,055
And it's my mother.
I will not watch.

413
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:26,015
According to phone records,
not your mother ever called.

414
00:24:26,474 --> 00:24:27,892
To hell with your records.

415
00:24:27,934 --> 00:24:29,477
My daughter is fine, just do not sit back
May you please.

416
00:24:29,978 --> 00:24:31,229
That has to catch the kidnapper.

417
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:32,605
You catch you?

418
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:34,489
He knows every move you make.

419
00:24:34,524 --> 00:24:36,568
- Look, Mrs. Verma, try...
- let it go.

420
00:24:37,026 --> 00:24:39,905
Your long arms of the law
were too short for my daughter.

421
00:24:40,364 --> 00:24:42,241
My daughter to come back, that's all that matters
.

422
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,534
What are you doing?

423
00:24:44,034 --> 00:24:46,954
I do not care if you catch the kidnappers
or not. - Ms. Verma!

424
00:24:47,413 --> 00:24:50,750
-Moving... come on.

425
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:10,395
Hello. - Boman phone, lady.
Niyaz want you hanging.

426
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,529
Listen...

427
00:25:19,821 --> 00:25:21,740
Your old mother has diabetes.

428
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:25,410
And you need money to her with insulin injections
.

429
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:27,746
When you slipped into the house
Siya...

430
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:29,998
You saw that she was already dead.

431
00:25:30,457 --> 00:25:31,917
Thi was done
fear and ran.

432
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:34,461
And in haste... you have your fingerprints... left

433
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,298
And footprints everywhere.

434
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:46,140
You're good! You're good!

435
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,558
Very good.

436
00:25:47,683 --> 00:25:48,643
Sign that.

437
00:25:49,018 --> 00:25:53,981
The newspapers are right about you.

438
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,858
By the way, who's well-voitorul...

439
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:58,319
Who wants so desperately to see you released?

440
00:25:58,354 --> 00:26:00,446
There are at least a dozen in this town.

441
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:02,532
Deliver the goods more people.

442
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,659
One must
to pay the debt.

443
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:08,454
Someone must...
him to miss me!

444
00:26:22,261 --> 00:26:24,012
I am
*** and you seem more concerned Niyaz.

445
00:26:24,346 --> 00:26:25,080
That's not fair.

446
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,932
Nothing is honest or dishonest
friendship.

447
00:26:27,349 --> 00:26:28,934
You said you însuþi.

448
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:31,145
Profiþi of my weakness.

449
00:26:31,603 --> 00:26:32,646
Yes, and?

450
00:26:33,147 --> 00:26:34,815
I was suspended, e
a warrant against me.

451
00:26:35,149 --> 00:26:36,108
I avoided.

452
00:26:36,358 --> 00:26:38,861
I have the key... your liberatatii.

453
00:26:39,361 --> 00:26:40,822

454
00:26:41,322 --> 00:26:43,908
Cauþiunea...

00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:45,118
Thank you very much.

456
00:26:45,153 --> 00:26:45,869
Now tell logged fee.

457
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:49,497
Come,
Yohaan... I need your help.

458
00:26:49,956 --> 00:26:52,459
I want you
meets with Dr. Satish.

459
00:26:52,917 --> 00:26:57,213
Can be only one reason to be killed so brutally.

460
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:00,049
Victim must have seen it on the killer.

461
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:02,552
And  murderers can not tolerate this.

462
00:27:03,052 --> 00:27:05,722
You mean...
victim and killer were familiar with it.

463
00:27:06,181 --> 00:27:07,140
****

464
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:10,393
I spent my whole life
investigating crime scenes, Doc.

465
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,979
Killer was either cynical...

466
00:27:12,354 --> 00:27:14,690
Or and took the exact same type of revanºa
the victim.

467
00:27:14,725 --> 00:27:17,026
Normally such crimes are either well planned...

468
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:21,697
Or impulsive when things get out of hand.

469
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:24,158
This case is a mix of both.

470
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:27,995
Wounds are unplanned and random.

471
00:27:28,412 --> 00:27:31,081
But that's after work
a professional job.

472
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,376
And before arranging  body
First he washed it with alcohol...

473
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:36,212
So did the remaining
no trial.

474
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:37,296
But the murder weapon?

475
00:27:37,713 --> 00:27:40,549
A carving knife has been used as a saw's
.

476
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,052
As a saw...

477
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:45,472
Logged imagine that this is
carving knife, and that's Siya body.

478
00:27:46,014 --> 00:27:48,141
- Something like...
- Enough, doctor, not a show.

479
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,268
You were going to tell us something?

480
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:53,438
Yes, I found traces of a drug in the mouth
Siya.

481
00:27:53,939 --> 00:27:54,898
Phencyclidine.

482
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,818
- Phencyclidine e...
- Dust Angels. Creates hallucinations.

483
00:27:58,318 --> 00:28:00,403
Very popular among young generation these days.

484
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:03,824
Drug known as Angel.

485
00:28:07,077 --> 00:28:08,036
Hello...

486
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,996
- How's Sanaya?
- It's good.

487
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,543
- I want to talk to her.
- At the right time.

488
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:16,337
Listen... - How your investigative
arise?

489
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:20,383
Way, discussing those two proºti?

490
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:24,220
- You're here?
- Îþi wasting your time.

491
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:28,266
Where're ?

492
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:31,769
Where're ?

493
00:28:33,771 --> 00:28:36,315
You always have two choices for everything.

494
00:28:36,774 --> 00:28:37,733
Two options.

495
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,985
Organized... or impulsive.

496
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:41,112
Source... or sweet.

497
00:28:41,571 --> 00:28:43,449
A crime is a crime, not a cocktail
whatsoever.

498
00:28:43,574 --> 00:28:44,825
So we agree to disagree again.

499
00:28:45,284 --> 00:28:46,285
Again with dezecord agreement.

500
00:28:46,326 --> 00:28:49,663
Even if you are agree or disagree...

501
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,175
Lady...

502
00:29:01,675 --> 00:29:03,051
Calm down... do not move the.

503
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:07,014
The number of pieces on the board.

504
00:29:07,514 --> 00:29:11,143
Hell.

505
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:12,853
Hello, Professor.

506
00:29:13,353 --> 00:29:14,230
I'm Inspector Yohaan,
in case Siya.

507
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:15,774
I arrested Niyaz.

508
00:29:16,274 --> 00:29:17,901
We want to talk to you.

509
00:29:18,401 --> 00:29:20,320
I'm sorry, I do not want to talk.

510
00:29:20,737 --> 00:29:21,696
Yes.

511
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:22,996
I already said what I had to say.

512
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:26,826
- Îþi can understand the pain.
- No, you can not!

513
00:29:27,285 --> 00:29:28,953
So... give me peace.

514
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:33,416
That villain has spoiled many more children
innocent.

515
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:36,169
There's no need to tell me
this, Inspector Yohaan.

516
00:29:36,669 --> 00:29:37,086
I know.

517
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:39,756
Sister of one of those victims
wants to talk to you.

518
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:43,176
Just talk to her, please.

519
00:29:47,932 --> 00:29:50,184
Anuradha Verma.

520
00:29:50,684 --> 00:29:51,644
Garima Chaudhary.

521
00:29:51,894 --> 00:29:52,853
She's a writer.

522
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:54,897
And he wants to convey pain
all those who suffered...

523
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,148
Through her writings.

524
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:59,318
And what about those who do not and feel the wounds?

525
00:29:59,777 --> 00:30:03,155
Always open wounds
one another, Ms. Garima.

526
00:30:06,617 --> 00:30:09,995
Thank you.

527
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,711
That's the way Siya
tighten Thin cup of coffee.

528
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,130
She  I used to say...

529
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:21,091
Do not tighten so thin Dad coffee cup?

530
00:30:21,591 --> 00:30:22,968
He said if you catch the handle...

531
00:30:23,051 --> 00:30:24,761
Leave a void.

532
00:30:25,303 --> 00:30:27,597
I do not want a gap in my life.

533
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:31,101
I want to feel with bare fingers.

534
00:30:31,601 --> 00:30:34,980
Whether it's a cup of coffee... or a relationship
.

535
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,275
- Anyway, I gotta go, Mom.
- But I just got here.

536
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:40,777
But I told you to call
before coming here.

537
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:41,987
Who knows if you are home or not?

00:30:42,446 --> 00:30:43,280
And even if you are
Who knows what condition.

539
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:44,739
I'm sorry, dear.

540
00:30:45,198 --> 00:30:46,701
I had no intention to come here.

541
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,914
I was just passing and I thought to give a
flee.

542
00:30:52,457 --> 00:30:55,668
I can not stop me
to worry about you.

543
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,630
If you really îþi
worry about me, do not ever leave my father.

544
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:02,967
Siya, I told
of a hundred times...

545
00:31:03,468 --> 00:31:05,636
That was not just my decision
despãrþim to us.

546
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:07,305
It was your father too.

547
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:08,347
You've forced.

548
00:31:08,681 --> 00:31:10,516
He had a choice.

549
00:31:10,975 --> 00:31:15,563
I could leave on me or style of life.

550
00:31:16,022 --> 00:31:18,484
Anyway... take this money.

551
00:31:18,901 --> 00:31:19,985
No thank you.

552
00:31:20,486 --> 00:31:22,654
This trust fund house and that my father left them

553
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:24,156
Are more than enough.

554
00:31:24,615 --> 00:31:27,201
He fulfilled all desires as it was in life.

555
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,954
And do this even after he died.

556
00:31:31,455 --> 00:31:34,792
However, late.
Go...

557
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,300
Do not tell me...
when you got that?

558
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:45,135
It's nothing, Mom.

559
00:31:45,636 --> 00:31:48,640
Even
important first step is for the mother.

560
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:51,392
And you have earned a trophy.

561
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:55,230
Let's go.

562
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,403
It was a girl with Siya
independent thinking?

563
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:04,823
Like her father.

564
00:32:05,323 --> 00:32:06,282
Lively.

565
00:32:06,574 --> 00:32:09,452
Siya and took
creativity from him?

566
00:32:09,911 --> 00:32:11,913
Creativity, as the lifestyle.

567
00:32:12,372 --> 00:32:13,915
What do you mean by lifestyle?

568
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:18,087
The same lifestyle that ultimately took her life
Siya father.

569
00:32:18,629 --> 00:32:22,675
Party all night...
no control over food and drink.

570
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:27,430
Work was his life... and life
was a party without-end.

571
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:31,058
... And it was with relationships.

572
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,310
I...

573
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:37,565
I never intervened in Siya personal life.

574
00:32:38,023 --> 00:32:40,067
Siya wanted to live as closely
relations...

575
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:42,570
Her as the cup of coffee.

576
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:46,115
That means... she must have had many friends.

577
00:32:46,657 --> 00:32:48,493
He had many friends.

578
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,413
If you do not mind me asking, loving...

579
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:52,873
Sure that was loving.

580
00:32:53,415 --> 00:32:54,791
I would have been surprised if he had.

581
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:58,712
Siya mine was so sweetheart.

582
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:01,548
Her world was very great.

583
00:33:02,007 --> 00:33:04,885
There was room for everyone...

584
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:09,973
Except me.

585
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:12,100
I'm sorry.

586
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:14,728
No, I think we must repent new.

587
00:33:15,187 --> 00:33:17,731
Anuradha, you got what you wanted?

588
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:20,151
Ready.

589
00:33:20,651 --> 00:33:24,447
I'm sorry, and thank
, Ms. Garima.

590
00:33:24,906 --> 00:33:26,240
Inspector  Yohaan.

591
00:33:26,741 --> 00:33:27,825
Yes.

592
00:33:28,284 --> 00:33:30,244
I heard
Niyaz has hired a new lawyer...

593
00:33:30,787 --> 00:33:32,830
And that's very good.

594
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:34,248
Yes, and I've heard.

595
00:33:34,749 --> 00:33:37,794
- You think you can be paid?
- No, I do not.

596
00:33:38,336 --> 00:33:39,921
Will receive the sentence of death.

597
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:42,548
Has hell
reservation. Do not get your worry.

598
00:33:43,049 --> 00:33:44,217
I do not know...

599
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:51,225
I just want him to be
not issued any price.

600
00:33:51,725 --> 00:33:55,062
Yes!

601
00:33:58,816 --> 00:33:59,775
So, sir, we can
receive your încuviinþarea.

602
00:34:00,192 --> 00:34:01,610
If you need anything, contact Yadav
Poth him.

603
00:34:01,693 --> 00:34:02,444
Yes, of course.

604
00:34:02,569 --> 00:34:06,365
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

605
00:34:06,448 --> 00:34:07,491
Sir.

606
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:12,329
Mr. Ronit
long waits.

607
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:15,707
Excuse me, sir.

608
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,376
Ronit  Hi, how are you?

609
00:34:17,876 --> 00:34:18,919
It has been a long time since our last meeting
.

610
00:34:19,419 --> 00:34:20,797
- Everything ok?
- All good, sir.

611
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:22,006
Just busy with work.

612
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:24,509
I even discussed intensively...
at the party office.

613
00:34:24,926 --> 00:34:27,595
I hear you're 'Boots'
for the post of chief prosecutor.

614
00:34:28,054 --> 00:34:30,682
With your help, anything is possible.

615
00:34:31,141 --> 00:34:33,059
- Help is always there for you.
- Thank you.

616
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,937
I read about the case of Niyaz.

617
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:37,730
Case Niyaz, sir?

618
00:34:38,189 --> 00:34:41,568
I heard Verma lawyer took the case.

619
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:45,155
- It's true?
- Yes, sir. It's true.

620
00:34:45,697 --> 00:34:51,787
Ronit, our party raised the issue of the fuse
woman and anti-rape.

621
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,457
If Anuradha deals to get them
Niyaz's acquittal...

622
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:57,001
Then it can be a big problem.

623
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,462
It can not, sir.

624
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:01,547
It's an open and shut case.

625
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:07,136
She just can not win. - Good.

626
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:10,973
Good!

627
00:35:16,604 --> 00:35:22,027
Bronzatule... must open it.
Îþi Or else I will break your head.

628
00:35:22,527 --> 00:35:25,614
- I'm sorry, I can not open.
- What do you want to say?

629
00:35:26,114 --> 00:35:26,907
You are a
Newton of breaking locks.

630
00:35:27,324 --> 00:35:28,283
And you can not break it?

631
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:30,118
Go and get your
father is calling, Einstein.

632
00:35:30,535 --> 00:35:32,245
Sir,
is manufactured in Germany, the last piece.

633
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,914
No one can open it.

634
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:36,041
I Poth break your head.

635
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:37,542
Must be some way.

636
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:38,877
Just trying something.

637
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:39,628
It's a way.

638
00:35:40,128 --> 00:35:41,463
- Give me the hammer.
- Here.

639
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:45,300
- Get back.
- Yes.

640
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,939
I'm suspended, but are
still a police officer.

641
00:35:58,397 --> 00:36:00,191
Breaking and entry, destruction of property...

642
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,943
Me and what will you do to break the law?

643
00:36:01,984 --> 00:36:03,861
Act is not blind, as they show in the movies.

644
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,321
Always supervise.

645
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,158
I'm sure dead.

646
00:36:18,668 --> 00:36:20,670
He must have been caught taking it there.

647
00:36:21,087 --> 00:36:24,508
Then  lounge.

648
00:36:28,762 --> 00:36:30,639
Stay. Stay.

649
00:36:31,098 --> 00:36:34,226
A raped Siya
on this table.

650
00:36:34,726 --> 00:36:37,146
You...

651
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:39,857
And after being raped...
Siya tried to save.

652
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:42,276
It was alive until he got here.

653
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:44,445
Thereafter
assailant came from behind them.

654
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:48,282
And  killed here.

655
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,581
The incident started in the bedroom...

656
00:36:55,081 --> 00:36:57,625
But there's no forced entry sign
.

657
00:36:58,126 --> 00:37:03,089
Siya
That means... we were familiar with the assassin.

658
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,842
But that can link
of Siya and Niyaz?

659
00:37:06,301 --> 00:37:07,719
I mean...

660
00:37:08,178 --> 00:37:10,889
Why would she be left on
Niyaz in her bedroom?

661
00:37:11,389 --> 00:37:14,434
Anu, that's our job.

662
00:37:14,934 --> 00:37:16,853
We will never incriminate an innocent man.

663
00:37:17,312 --> 00:37:18,521
In particular in such cases.

664
00:37:19,022 --> 00:37:20,356
Niyaz guilty.

665
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:24,153
No one can be 100% sure
in such cases.

666
00:37:24,612 --> 00:37:27,907
How Poth be you?

667
00:37:28,324 --> 00:37:29,450
I do not understand this.

668
00:37:29,992 --> 00:37:31,744
Fingerprints are scattered everywhere...

669
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:32,912
- As the traces of steps.
- Yes.

670
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:37,333
Killer was isteþ to clear a body Siya alcohol...

671
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:41,212
So that there is no DNA evidence.

672
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:45,049
Whether it's a race or
way... not ever quit.

673
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,931
- Did you say something?
- No nothing.

674
00:37:52,389 --> 00:37:55,769
Coffee.

675
00:37:58,105 --> 00:38:01,775
How you live in this mess? - I do.

676
00:38:02,234 --> 00:38:05,862
I just standby here.

677
00:38:06,363 --> 00:38:12,994
That night, someone came up with Siya
at her studio.

678
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:16,790
Siya was drunk.

679
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:21,711
Something happened between the two of them
... and he killed her.

680
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,672
Do you need to be killed
then and there.

681
00:38:24,131 --> 00:38:27,510
Niyaz came to the studio after Siya killing. To steal.

682
00:38:38,271 --> 00:38:41,649
And trodden
Siya blood that was already there.

683
00:38:47,822 --> 00:38:52,034
He was scared. We panicked.

684
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:53,786
From here traces of steps.

685
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:56,790
That means someone was there.

686
00:38:57,291 --> 00:39:01,128
We need to know who was that.

687
00:39:01,628 --> 00:39:03,380
It's not surprising that you found Siya car.

688
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:05,382
I have found her killer, why I
longer need the car?

689
00:39:05,883 --> 00:39:07,134
Finds it as quickly as possible.

690
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:09,011
Anu, being a workaholic is one thing...

691
00:39:09,094 --> 00:39:11,763
But you do is obsession.

692
00:39:12,222 --> 00:39:15,601
Give me a solid reason for Niyaz
which is not the killer!

693
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:22,524
And you did not call her even once... Sanaya

694
00:39:22,775 --> 00:39:24,443
Find out if was
back to school...

695
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:26,153
Or if eaten.

696
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,364
Sanaya's good;...

697
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:32,202
She's with her grandmother.

698
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:48,009
'
I wonder which city your intentions? "

699
00:39:48,468 --> 00:39:54,098
'
I wonder which city your intentions? "

700
00:39:54,557 --> 00:39:59,647
"There's less sky..."

701
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:04,985
"... And more birds."

702
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,823
'
I wonder which city your intentions? "

703
00:40:18,415 --> 00:40:23,921
"A joy shared,
share of trouble."

704
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:30,345
"A share of înghiþiturii,
a share of breath."

705
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:36,518
"
Wound and a share of the issue."

706
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:42,566
"A story of heart crushed."

707
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:48,697
"I wonder what's your love
charade."

708
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:54,661
"I wonder what's your love
charade."

709
00:40:55,203 --> 00:41:00,001
"
Resembles a defendant night."

710
00:41:00,418 --> 00:41:06,424
"And with a god day."

711
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,301
- Hello.
-'re Where?

712
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:09,760
You're still awake.

713
00:41:10,094 --> 00:41:11,554
- I'll get Benny.
- Where?

714
00:41:12,054 --> 00:41:14,348
Last place
Siya was seen before he was killed.

715
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,976
Do not try to do on your job
Sherlock Homes in...

716

Benny has a strong alibi that was not there.

00:41:19,562 --> 00:41:21,147
It does not take long to make an alibi, Yohaan.

718
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:22,648
Anyone can do.

719
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:25,193

Rights?

775
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:55,869
Rights... in India?

776
00:44:56,411 --> 00:44:58,204
Look at too many Hollywood films.

777
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:02,041

782
00:45:09,592 --> 00:45:10,926

Talk, or îþi

787
00:45:22,605 --> 00:45:25,524
Siya was a girl sweetheart...

00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:28,277
They

He learned in America.

791
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:30,613
It has nose holes.

792
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,947
Wearing a nose ring.

793
00:45:32,448 --> 00:45:33,365
How does it look?

794
00:45:33,532 --> 00:45:36,828
Look in your computer
Siya, is filled with his pictures.

795
00:45:45,754 --> 00:45:48,965
Ms. Verma, Sanayaei
condition is serious.

796
00:45:49,466 --> 00:45:50,509
Having trouble breathing.

797
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:53,261
I think it's something you ate.

798
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,055
Go to the hospital. Damn.

799
00:45:55,555 --> 00:45:57,265
What about, Ms. Verma?

800
00:45:57,724 --> 00:46:00,018
How do I lead a hostage to the hospital?

801
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,646
Îþi'll tell you where to bring her drugs.

802
00:46:03,146 --> 00:46:04,856
Go there as soon
you can.

803

00:46:47,818 --> 00:46:51,196
Dog backpack.

807
00:46:59,705 --> 00:47:03,083
Untie the dog.

808
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:09,799
Dosage is written on the bottle.

809
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,218
's A box behind you.

810
00:47:12,677 --> 00:47:16,055
A small but to encourage you.

811
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:42,917
My daughter.

812
00:47:49,673 --> 00:47:53,385
Mother!

813
00:47:53,844 --> 00:47:59,099
Mother!

814
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,897
Sanaya!

815
00:48:05,439 --> 00:48:08,652
Mother!

816
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,447
Mother!

817
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:15,909
Sanaya!

818
00:48:16,368 --> 00:48:17,494
Mother!

819
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:21,331
Sanaya!

820
00:48:22,707 --> 00:48:26,086
Mother!

821
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:56,826
Sanaya!

822
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:56,304
Sanaya!

823
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:03,665
Where there is no trust relationships...

824
00:51:03,707 --> 00:51:06,960
And no mobile network,
people start to play games.

825
00:51:07,461 --> 00:51:09,087
What game you play, Anu?

826
00:51:09,588 --> 00:51:10,547
What are you doing here?

827
00:51:10,797 --> 00:51:12,884
I could have your same question put
.

828
00:51:13,384 --> 00:51:14,343
Who called you here?

829
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:16,929
Who called me here?

830
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:18,931
Girl asks your... eyes.

831
00:51:19,474 --> 00:51:22,518
Fatigue and exhaustion  you.

832
00:51:22,977 --> 00:51:24,395
- Sanaya Where?
- With her grandmother.

833
00:51:24,896 --> 00:51:26,772
- Sanaya Where?
- I said that's her grandmother.

834
00:51:27,231 --> 00:51:29,066
Let me talk to her.
I want to talk to her!

835
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,318
Where is Sanaya?

836
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,488
I heard þipând, Anuradha.

837
00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:34,906
Where Sanaya?

838
00:51:35,156 --> 00:51:38,576
Someone kidnapped my Sanaya
, Yohaan.

839
00:51:41,537 --> 00:51:44,124
And redemption is freedom of Niyaz.

840
00:51:44,583 --> 00:51:46,794
That's why you took this case?

841
00:51:47,252 --> 00:51:49,379
If it does not,
they would be killed...

842
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,632
Or do something terrible, Yohaan.

843
00:51:51,924 --> 00:51:53,550
I do not know.

844
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:56,345
Well, you did what you had to do.

845
00:51:56,845 --> 00:51:58,180
Now I'll do what I have to do.

846
00:51:58,347 --> 00:51:58,847
Yohaan...

847
00:51:59,264 --> 00:52:00,265
No, no, no...

848
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:01,350
Yohaan not.

849
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,559
No!

850
00:52:02,976 --> 00:52:04,895
Listen... No!

851
00:52:05,395 --> 00:52:07,439
- Listen, you do not do anything.
- Poth thought I stop?

852
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:08,899
Maybe not, but îþi may require.

853
00:52:09,399 --> 00:52:10,192
Why you ask?
Are customary to give orders.

854
00:52:10,275 --> 00:52:11,401
Ordered me!

855
00:52:11,443 --> 00:52:12,611
I beg you as a friend, Yohaan.

856
00:52:13,111 --> 00:52:14,197
Friend?

857
00:52:14,656 --> 00:52:16,574
If I friend I have come to me first.

858
00:52:17,033 --> 00:52:18,993
Why do not you tell me?

859
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:22,163
I wanted to come to you,
Yohaan, believe me.

860
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:24,749
But I was afraid that you might react in this way
.

861
00:52:24,874 --> 00:52:26,626
They should have to be afraid, not Thiele.

862
00:52:27,085 --> 00:52:29,212
He knows everything Yohaan.

863
00:52:29,671 --> 00:52:32,549
The places I go, the people I meet
... Everything.

864
00:52:33,007 --> 00:52:33,967
Yesterday at restaurant...

865
00:52:34,092 --> 00:52:37,137
He heard everything we talked.

866
00:52:37,637 --> 00:52:39,514
Maybe it was right there.

867
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:40,974
I am telling you, Yohaan.

868
00:52:41,432 --> 00:52:43,601
I can not do anything.

869
00:52:44,061 --> 00:52:45,813
Why do not you tell me?

870
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:49,400
I should have told me.

871
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:50,818
Yohaan, please...

872
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:52,278
You should have told me.

873
00:52:52,695 --> 00:52:56,031
I could tell not logged in.

874
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:03,831
My Sanaya was led Yohaan.

875
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:09,003
- I lost the Sanaya yet.
- My Sanaya was gone.

876
00:53:09,545 --> 00:53:12,882
- Anuradha, I lost the Sanaya.
- I can not.

877
00:53:19,556 --> 00:53:23,018
I almost lost it once before
on Sanaya.

878
00:53:23,477 --> 00:53:25,353
I was pregnant...

879
00:53:25,854 --> 00:53:28,940
And I found out that my husband was a girl.

880
00:53:29,357 --> 00:53:31,026
Said...

881
00:53:31,526 --> 00:53:33,028
That we have a girl later.

882
00:53:33,528 --> 00:53:36,823
First I want a son.

883
00:53:37,324 --> 00:53:39,743
Even his relatives wanted a boy.

884
00:53:40,243 --> 00:53:41,786
I was so alone.

885
00:53:42,287 --> 00:53:45,165
As you know I loved him.

886
00:53:45,666 --> 00:53:48,503
I even stopped practicing law practice's sake.

887
00:53:49,003 --> 00:53:52,465
Settling in America  us.

888
00:53:52,965 --> 00:53:56,177
It was our baby...

889
00:53:56,677 --> 00:54:01,891
And he said "abort him."

890
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:04,268
To kill my daughter.

891
00:54:04,769 --> 00:54:08,105
My Sanaya!

892
00:54:11,192 --> 00:54:14,612
A man becomes father after the baby is born.

893
00:54:15,112 --> 00:54:18,075
But a woman becomes mother...

894
00:54:18,575 --> 00:54:23,831
From the moment the child starts
to grow in her womb.

895
00:54:24,331 --> 00:54:31,088
A man can say 'abort baby "...

896
00:54:31,547 --> 00:54:35,509
But not a mother.

897
00:54:36,009 --> 00:54:38,887
Flee from hoodlums.

898
00:54:39,346 --> 00:54:42,975
Far from the world, which has no
no place for my child.

899
00:54:43,392 --> 00:54:46,395
I almost lost it once,
can not lose again.

900
00:54:46,896 --> 00:54:49,649
Do not lose.

901
00:54:50,108 --> 00:54:52,569
You know, someday it would call Sanaya.

902
00:54:53,027 --> 00:54:54,195
He says "Mom did not have time."

903
00:54:54,654 --> 00:54:57,240
"It's always busy."

904
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:00,910
I wonder how she looks at me.

905
00:55:01,327 --> 00:55:06,332
But I always saw in her a daughter.

906
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:08,293
Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder...

907
00:55:08,328 --> 00:55:10,670
If you die now, what will I lose?

908
00:55:11,129 --> 00:55:15,758
My job, uniform, money, alcohol?

909
00:55:16,217 --> 00:55:20,806
I wonder... and I see two faces in front of me
.

910
00:55:21,265 --> 00:55:24,268
Sanaya and you.

911
00:55:24,727 --> 00:55:27,563
Time shed tears had stopped.

912
00:55:28,105 --> 00:55:31,400
Arise.

913
00:55:37,364 --> 00:55:40,701
The battle starts now.

914
00:55:53,507 --> 00:55:56,051
Only
's lawyer Niyaz came to visit him in prison. - Yes.

915
00:55:56,092 --> 00:55:57,636
If anyone makes a visit...

916
00:55:57,677 --> 00:56:01,056
- Inform me immediately.
- Of course, sir.

917
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:04,726
- Hey, Joe.
- What surprise, sir.

918
00:56:05,185 --> 00:56:07,062
Las her later
Here's what I do first.

919
00:56:07,145 --> 00:56:09,439
- What, sir?
- You know Niyaz's case?

920
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:10,899
Not many.

921
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:12,275
Review the records.

922
00:56:12,734 --> 00:56:16,154
I want a list foºtii his cellmate. - Ok.

923
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:24,872
Anu, are close to Niyaz's camp.

924
00:56:25,373 --> 00:56:26,958
'm Sure the kidnapper's somewhere around.

925
00:56:27,291 --> 00:56:30,628
Go to Siya's studio
and check her computer.

926
00:56:50,315 --> 00:56:52,151
Dra. Verma.

927
00:56:52,609 --> 00:56:57,281
I'm sorry... but I had to break the door lock...

928
00:56:57,739 --> 00:56:59,241
Enter into my daughter's life?

929
00:56:59,658 --> 00:57:01,118
I'm sorry, I...

930
00:57:01,535 --> 00:57:04,163
Yohaan say it's ok. I can stop this.

931
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,665
No, it's ok.

932
00:57:07,124 --> 00:57:12,754
After Siya disappeared...
feeling empty around me.

933
00:57:13,255 --> 00:57:16,800
And to fill that void...
I kept everything in such a way...

934
00:57:17,259 --> 00:57:19,845
Siya that you feel that it's still here.

935
00:57:20,305 --> 00:57:24,767
I saw that... most works of art by Siya
were incomplete.

936
00:57:25,268 --> 00:57:26,227
Why?

937
00:57:26,519 --> 00:57:29,856
Siya was very impatient.

938
00:57:30,273 --> 00:57:32,942
And would start her next
sculpture or painting...

939
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:34,944
Before it finishes the previous one.

940
00:57:35,445 --> 00:57:37,071
Bored easily.

941
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:41,159
It was the same
relationships with them? - Maybe.

942
00:57:41,576 --> 00:57:42,827
Just like her father...

943
00:57:43,286 --> 00:57:44,746
Why did you despãrþit?

944
00:57:45,246 --> 00:57:47,290
That's the irony.

945
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:49,876
's Habits, which attracted me
by him...

946
00:57:50,293 --> 00:57:53,380
Later became the reason of our separation.

947
00:57:53,881 --> 00:57:58,385
's Creativity... his attitude... indifference.

948
00:57:58,886 --> 00:58:00,596
Any other reason?

949
00:58:01,096 --> 00:58:02,890
The Adventures of Dhananjay.

950
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:06,435
I have not told her father Siya about
adventures.

951
00:58:06,894 --> 00:58:10,314
Because... would have destroyed the image of the ideal man...

952
00:58:10,773 --> 00:58:12,316
Existing in her heart.

953
00:58:12,817 --> 00:58:14,985
So I sat silently...

954
00:58:15,402 --> 00:58:18,322
Siya and floated away.

955
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:21,368
Do you think the court will change the sentence to death by Niyaz...

956
00:58:21,868 --> 00:58:23,328
Prison for life?

957
00:58:23,787 --> 00:58:25,831
Or... will come out on bail.

958
00:58:26,331 --> 00:58:28,208
Nothing is impossible for his attorney.

959
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:31,628
I'm sorry, I must answer the phone
it.

960
00:58:32,128 --> 00:58:35,465
Excuse me... I'm so sorry!

961
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:46,810
Ram. -Good Come
sir. Welcome.

962
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:47,727
Ring  have your head.

963
00:58:48,186 --> 00:58:48,854
Sir, even without uniform...

964
00:58:49,354 --> 00:58:50,605
Meant the same thing as always.

965
00:58:51,064 --> 00:58:52,608
A yellow Nano was reported missing on 2

966
00:58:52,775 --> 00:58:54,443
Ok, sir. Just a minute.

967
00:58:54,902 --> 00:58:56,404
Boss...  Yohaan Lord is here.

968
00:58:56,863 --> 00:58:58,573
Asks a yellow Nano that has gone on 2.

969
00:58:58,865 --> 00:58:59,323
MH-14-DZ.

970
00:58:59,782 --> 00:59:00,783
MH-14-DZ.

971
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:02,201
- ..
8118 - 8118.

972
00:59:02,702 --> 00:59:05,037
- You have time until tomorrow.
- You have time until tomorrow.

973
00:59:05,496 --> 00:59:06,747
Sir, tomorrow?

974
00:59:07,248 --> 00:59:07,957
How can I find up tomorrow, sir?

975
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:10,084
Even if I put all the boys to work...

976
00:59:10,293 --> 00:59:11,419
If you do not find yourself up tomorrow...

977
00:59:11,544 --> 00:59:14,922
Then, after I finish with you,
'll look like a scrap.

978
00:59:21,512 --> 00:59:23,849
The first hearing is tomorrow... at 11am.

979
00:59:24,349 --> 00:59:26,560
He's here and the new lawyer Niyaz?

980
00:59:27,102 --> 00:59:30,397
It's a woman.

981
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,570
Ms. Chaudhary,
victim's mother.

982
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:40,532
- Attorney Verma...
- Niyaz's new lawyer.

983
00:59:41,033 --> 00:59:43,410
I have no intention to lie.

984
00:59:43,911 --> 00:59:45,204
I was ready to tell you the truth.

985
00:59:45,496 --> 00:59:47,414
Tell me why?

986
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:52,044
Because you met me in order to save it
on my daughter's killer.

987
00:59:52,503 --> 00:59:55,089
You've earned
confidence... you used me.

988
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:57,425
I never used by anyone.

989
00:59:57,926 --> 00:59:58,927
Just I am doing my job.

990
00:59:59,427 --> 01:00:01,721
So you lied?

991
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:06,434
Perhaps that pain in your eyes...

992
01:00:06,851 --> 01:00:08,228
Who deceived me and it was false.

993
01:00:08,269 --> 01:00:10,730
My pain
does not need your certificate, Ms. Garima.

994
01:00:11,272 --> 01:00:13,399
No
your pain does not need my sympathy.

995
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:15,735
All the have their own hell...

996
01:00:16,194 --> 01:00:17,904
And every need them to cope alone.

997
01:00:18,279 --> 01:00:21,282
Imagine logged Lord fereºte...

998
01:00:21,741 --> 01:00:25,079
If your daughter would have never passed
what my daughter...

999
01:00:25,538 --> 01:00:28,624
've Yet appear on that
rape? You would have defended him?

1000
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:35,172
Lawyer  Verma, your company
Abbas defends criminals.

1001
01:00:35,631 --> 01:00:36,590
I can understand that.

1002
01:00:36,757 --> 01:00:38,384
But... this garbage.

1003
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:41,053
Problem?

1004
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,932
And most decorated officer of the city...

1005
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,600
Help in this.

1006
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:51,063
Mr. Yohaan if
were not suspended...

1007
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,732
You have received a medal
yet for this good deed.

1008
01:00:54,066 --> 01:00:55,485
You've arrested
Niyaz, is not it?

1009
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,530
And now a ajuþi
her to acquit.

1010
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,449
What about your honesty, Inspector?

1011
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:02,909
You sold it?

1012
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:07,497
Garima, it gives life
no luxury to keep its honesty.

1013
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:10,458
Or the freedom to choose between good and evil.

1014
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,544
Life often brings you to a crossroads...

1015
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,047
Where it is difficult to choose whether to save our lives or honor
.

1016
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:18,842
What difficulties life threw on you...

1017
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,928
They were forced to save
that monster.

1018
01:01:22,429 --> 01:01:24,014
I can not answer that question now.

1019
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,892
But I do...
when the time comes.

1020
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:27,310
Let's go.

1021
01:01:27,477 --> 01:01:31,522
Ms. Verma,
fight not only for my daughter.

1022
01:01:32,023 --> 01:01:33,816
But for all daughters...

1023
01:01:34,275 --> 01:01:37,653
Whose mothers still awaiting justice.

1024
01:01:42,992 --> 01:01:46,370
Come.

1025
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:55,964
Have you found anything?

1026
01:01:56,465 --> 01:01:58,425
Siya friend's name is Sam.

1027
01:01:58,884 --> 01:02:00,761
It is 23 years addicted to drugs.

1028
01:02:01,261 --> 01:02:02,888
And now it's in recovery.

1029
01:02:03,388 --> 01:02:06,558
But Sam can not be assassin. - Why?

1030
01:02:07,017 --> 01:02:08,811
E in hospital Lulie 26, 2013

1031
01:02:09,353 --> 01:02:12,648
A week before he was killed Siya.

1032
01:02:14,483 --> 01:02:15,442
Typical case.

1033
01:02:15,609 --> 01:02:16,151
Puºtiul rãsfãþat of a rich father.

1034
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:17,945
It was in America  kicks.

1035
01:02:18,278 --> 01:02:20,155
Without education... just
Confession in drugs.

1036
01:02:20,656 --> 01:02:22,533
He graduated from marijuana to LSD.

1037
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:24,159
And finally...
Dust Angels.

1038
01:02:24,535 --> 01:02:26,036
So you're completely safe...

1039
01:02:26,538 --> 01:02:28,581
That Sam was hospitalized on 26 Lulie, 2013

1040
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:32,043
- It's your registry?
- Let me check.

1041
01:02:32,502 --> 01:02:34,379
Yeah... sure.

1042
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:37,382
He was hospitalized on 26 lulia at 4pm.

1043
01:02:37,841 --> 01:02:39,092
- This.
- Ok.

1044
01:02:39,592 --> 01:02:42,929
Thank you.

1045
01:03:05,995 --> 01:03:06,954
Siya...

1046
01:03:07,204 --> 01:03:09,290
You knew Siya?

1047
01:03:09,748 --> 01:03:11,542
Siya was an angel.

1048
01:03:12,001 --> 01:03:14,837
I love being with her.

1049
01:03:15,337 --> 01:03:17,756
It was not overspend.

1050
01:03:18,257 --> 01:03:23,429
No pressure... I felt truly free
around her.

1051
01:03:23,888 --> 01:03:26,140
Poth  please stop that?

1052
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:29,186
Lie me out, please.

1053
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:31,688
- Stop what?
- That recorder.

1054
01:03:32,147 --> 01:03:35,567
I can not stand it!

1055
01:03:37,986 --> 01:03:41,406
Anu.

1056
01:03:44,993 --> 01:03:45,994
Hey... what?

1057
01:03:46,453 --> 01:03:48,288
What is happening here?

1058
01:03:48,788 --> 01:03:50,415
Sam is a patient  Class

1059
01:03:50,874 --> 01:03:53,960

You two please take
quitting here! Now!

1061
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,729
It's crazy.

1062
01:04:12,271 --> 01:04:15,608
Drugs have short-circuited brain.

1063
01:04:20,696 --> 01:04:21,739
- Turn machine.
- What?

1064
01:04:22,198 --> 01:04:25,576
Yohaan, turn the car now.

1065
01:04:41,385 --> 01:04:43,178
You just 5 minutes after the alarm starts.

1066
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:44,930
Ok.

1067
01:04:45,389 --> 01:04:48,600
A decent world no longer exists.

1068
01:04:49,017 --> 01:04:50,018
Wait, madam.
Where are you going?

1069
01:04:50,227 --> 01:04:52,479
- I want to see him on the director!
- I can not allow entry.

1070
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:56,150
Now I will be...

1071
01:04:56,525 --> 01:05:00,113
How the world is.

1072
01:05:00,572 --> 01:05:02,740
Exit...

1073
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,826
Run... exit.

1074
01:05:05,285 --> 01:05:07,996
Come on...

1075
01:05:08,438 --> 01:05:09,013

Sam!

1078

1083
01:05:26,598 --> 01:05:28,641
Sam!

1084
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,143
Who killed Siya?

1085
01:05:30,644 --> 01:05:32,062
You said you knew who killed the Siya.

1086
01:05:32,396 --> 01:05:36,150
Tell me everything,
Sam. All...

1087
01:05:36,692 --> 01:05:38,527
You can not win.

1088
01:05:38,944 --> 01:05:41,864
He killed Siya, he will kill
and you. - Who is he?

1089
01:05:42,406 --> 01:05:43,324
Who killed Siya?

1090
01:05:43,657 --> 01:05:45,284
What happened, tell me
everything.

1091
01:05:45,784 --> 01:05:47,036
- Sam.
- That's funny!

1092
01:05:47,495 --> 01:05:48,496
Talk with me. Sam.

1093
01:05:48,954 --> 01:05:52,791
Sam, stops it.
Talk with me.

1094
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,794
Sam, who killed Siya.

1095
01:05:56,295 --> 01:05:59,673
Sam!

1096
01:06:13,396 --> 01:06:16,817
Thi I told you not to call me.

1097
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,367
Mr. Sunny Singh, who
professional's your line?

1098
01:06:25,826 --> 01:06:27,577
Well... we're in business with locks and keys.

1099
01:06:27,619 --> 01:06:29,037
We open locks and keys....

1100
01:06:29,329 --> 01:06:30,997
Need to tell you that two days ago
remembers...

1101
01:06:31,331 --> 01:06:34,043
Logged asked to break the lock
flat no. 306. - Yes.

1102
01:06:34,544 --> 01:06:35,503
- Poth?
- No.

1103
01:06:35,586 --> 01:06:36,546
Why not?

1104
01:06:36,629 --> 01:06:39,715
I told then and there... that this is the last lock
in Germany.

1105
01:06:40,174 --> 01:06:41,342
And honorable court, even my father...

1106
01:06:41,843 --> 01:06:43,427
Who is in business for 30 years,
can not open the lock.

1107
01:06:43,928 --> 01:06:46,848
You mean... when you have not managed to open that lock...

1108
01:06:47,265 --> 01:06:49,684
Then and a skillful thief would have failed.

1109
01:06:50,101 --> 01:06:51,060
- Right?
- Right.

1110
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:54,856
Dr. Satish, you performed the autopsy on the body
Siya? - Yes.

1111
01:06:55,356 --> 01:06:56,315
What have you found at autopsy?

1112
01:06:56,482 --> 01:06:58,317
There were traces of chemicals in her blood.

1113
01:06:58,818 --> 01:06:59,777
What chemicals?

1114
01:06:59,819 --> 01:07:02,029
It's a chemical called phencyclidine.

1115
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:04,158
Young call him anymore and angel dust.

1116
01:07:04,366 --> 01:07:05,576
Drugs  youth.

1117
01:07:06,034 --> 01:07:07,369
The one that I use to fumigate
?

1118
01:07:07,411 --> 01:07:08,203
Yes.

1119
01:07:08,287 --> 01:07:10,873
Your daughter Siya lived with you?

1120
01:07:11,415 --> 01:07:13,417
No, he lived alone.

1121
01:07:13,876 --> 01:07:15,502
Strange, you were a single parent.

1122
01:07:15,961 --> 01:07:17,254
And yet your daughter lived alone.

1123
01:07:17,629 --> 01:07:18,922
Not always.

1124
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:22,718
Since he turned 18. - Why?

1125
01:07:23,177 --> 01:07:24,970
Aveaþi made two arguments?

1126
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:27,264
Or was your family farewell reason?

1127
01:07:27,764 --> 01:07:28,807
Objection, honorable court.

1128
01:07:29,099 --> 01:07:31,351
What Verma lawyer trying to prove?

1129
01:07:31,894 --> 01:07:33,646
My motive was to attract attention
Court by that...

1130
01:07:34,063 --> 01:07:36,524
Fâþele when a family falls apart
feel alone...

1131
01:07:36,566 --> 01:07:38,902
They choose the wrong path in search of love and aid
.

1132
01:07:39,402 --> 01:07:41,237
- Siya was not so.
- So how was Ms. Garima.

1133
01:07:41,696 --> 01:07:44,782
My daughter was the most brilliant student of ªcolii Arts
JJ.

1134
01:07:45,241 --> 01:07:48,369
But all artwork in her studio
are mostly incomplete.

1135
01:07:48,912 --> 01:07:50,371
It was a naked and in her life?

1136
01:07:50,872 --> 01:07:52,457
It's a goal in life for all.

1137
01:07:52,916 --> 01:07:54,918
Nobody has a complete world, Lawyer Verma!

1138
01:07:55,418 --> 01:07:59,714
You can say as your daughter
filled the void in her life?

1139
01:08:00,173 --> 01:08:02,383
How do
Most young people these days.

1140
01:08:02,884 --> 01:08:04,470
With their friends.

1141
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:06,055
Objection, honorable court.

1142
01:08:06,555 --> 01:08:09,308
This case is about killing
Siya, not her personal life.

1143
01:08:09,767 --> 01:08:12,353
Honorable court,
conditions in which he was killed Siya...

1144
01:08:12,853 --> 01:08:15,251
Her life style
has a big role to play in them.

1145
01:08:15,286 --> 01:08:17,650
- Please continue.
- Thank you, honorable court.

1146
01:08:18,067 --> 01:08:20,820
- Your daughter had friends?
- Who has not?

1147
01:08:21,237 --> 01:08:22,530
I had lots of friends.

1148
01:08:22,947 --> 01:08:25,574
- Loving?
- Yes.

1149
01:08:26,033 --> 01:08:27,451
It also  and male friends.

1150
01:08:27,493 --> 01:08:28,953
How was the relationship with her boyfriend Siya?

1151
01:08:29,411 --> 01:08:30,454
Objection, honorable court.

1152
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:32,498
This is just a test to a humble Siya.

1153
01:08:32,581 --> 01:08:33,958
I do not agree, honorable court.

1154
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:36,837
To find the true murderer, it's important to know...

1155
01:08:37,295 --> 01:08:39,506
Siya who were friends, makes...

1156
01:08:39,965 --> 01:08:40,966
Who walks her?

1157
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:45,011
And how going on, if it does?

1158
01:08:45,512 --> 01:08:48,890
You close or not?

1159
01:09:00,402 --> 01:09:00,861
- Joe.
- Yes, sir.

1160
01:09:01,278 --> 01:09:03,405
- It's a case of kidnapping. Send reinforcements.
- Good sir.

1161
01:09:03,446 --> 01:09:06,576
Siya had relationships with a lot of men?

1162
01:09:06,993 --> 01:09:08,661
I'll repeat the question.

1163
01:09:09,078 --> 01:09:12,415
Siya had relationships with a lot of men?

1164
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:15,543
Ms. Garima, I hope you understand
from what I get.

1165
01:09:16,002 --> 01:09:18,796
I understand perfectly what you're trying to say.

1166
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:23,342
Want my daughter to prove she was neruºinata.

1167
01:09:23,801 --> 01:09:24,802
On what basis?

1168
01:09:25,011 --> 01:09:27,388
Because men had few friends?

1169
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:32,143
Lawyer  Verma, my daughter was
deºteaptã, beautiful, emotion.

1170
01:09:32,685 --> 01:09:35,021
Men can
swarmed around her, and what if?

1171
01:09:35,563 --> 01:09:36,523
Is that a crime?

1172
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,651
I'm one of those who always believe that...
...

1173
01:09:40,152 --> 01:09:41,612
Woman is always the one who's to blame.

1174
01:09:42,112 --> 01:09:45,199
People who
not blame the girl and the rapist after she was raped.

1175
01:09:45,699 --> 01:09:47,576
They blame her feel dressed...

1176
01:09:48,035 --> 01:09:50,162
Blame her independent thinking.

1177
01:09:50,662 --> 01:09:52,623
Blame simply because it is the girl?

1178
01:09:53,081 --> 01:09:55,042
Ms. Garima, sorry
have your feelings hurt!

1179
01:09:55,167 --> 01:09:58,879
No, Lawyer Verma.
Îþi not sorry.

1180
01:09:59,338 --> 01:10:01,381
Meanwhile're just a lawyer...

1181
01:10:01,882 --> 01:10:04,510
Who wants to earn a
case at any cost.

1182
01:10:04,968 --> 01:10:09,390
If you had little kindness or sympathy...

1183
01:10:09,849 --> 01:10:12,644
Then you would understand my pain.

1184
01:10:13,144 --> 01:10:14,771
I dream about my daughter every night...

1185
01:10:14,854 --> 01:10:16,314
Where it says...

1186
01:10:16,856 --> 01:10:20,026
"Mom, save me.
I want to live."

1187
01:10:20,527 --> 01:10:21,486
"Help me mother..."

1188
01:10:21,778 --> 01:10:26,241
Back when she was a child, even a small sughiþ
I would have given sleepless nights.

1189
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:28,785
Imagine my condition when logged...

1190
01:10:29,285 --> 01:10:32,455
Þipãtul they rang in my ears every night
.

1191
01:10:32,956 --> 01:10:35,917
Honorable court,
serious objection against this type of hearing.

1192
01:10:36,376 --> 01:10:39,004
My questions are relevant, honorable court.

1193
01:10:39,463 --> 01:10:42,716
You know that your daughter take drugs?

1194
01:10:43,175 --> 01:10:45,010
Yes.

1195
01:10:45,469 --> 01:10:47,847
Honorable court, shall record please.

1196
01:10:48,264 --> 01:10:49,598
Siya was a young girl.

1197
01:10:50,057 --> 01:10:51,016
Lived alone.

1198
01:10:51,183 --> 01:10:53,936
He had lots of friends
extra men and taking drugs.

1199
01:10:54,436 --> 01:10:56,689
And that night, lock the apartment
Siya...

1200
01:10:57,147 --> 01:10:58,607
It was impossible to open from the outside.

1201
01:10:59,108 --> 01:11:01,735
So obviously... Siya opened it
it its very inside.

1202
01:11:02,194 --> 01:11:04,155
And Siya  murderers who came
in her apartment that night...

1203
01:11:04,697 --> 01:11:07,116
Must have been one of
men friends of Siya...

1204
01:11:07,158 --> 01:11:09,161
Which Siya should he be invited to it its very.

1205
01:11:09,661 --> 01:11:11,329
And not the same thief: Fine...

1206
01:11:11,830 --> 01:11:15,125
Who came there to steal money
few medicines his mother.

1207
01:11:15,625 --> 01:11:19,880
That would be just, honorable court.

1208
01:11:20,338 --> 01:11:26,219
Pause.
Process will continue after an hour.

1209
01:11:26,678 --> 01:11:30,098
Ms. Verma...

1210
01:11:31,892 --> 01:11:35,020
What I did Niyaz
my daughter behind closed doors...

1211
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,026
Thou hast made her character
sight.

1212
01:11:40,526 --> 01:11:42,904
What's the difference between you and Niyaz
?

1213
01:11:43,362 --> 01:11:46,741
None.

1214
01:11:52,705 --> 01:11:54,123
Madam, I find.

1215
01:11:54,582 --> 01:11:58,085
Lady...'re very good.

1216

And that Garima
... so it's a good actress.

1217
01:12:02,924 --> 01:12:04,967
What reprezentaþie gave in court.

1218
01:12:05,468 --> 01:12:08,387
"You have no idea what
must pass a mother?"

1219
01:12:08,846 --> 01:12:11,683
...
Your case is defended by a parent.

1220
01:12:12,184 --> 01:12:15,521
Not a lawyer, you understand?

1221
01:12:53,184 --> 01:12:54,769
- Your name?

1222
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:56,229

Any kind of drug.

1233
01:13:22,756 --> 01:13:26,719
Ecstasy. Marijuana. MDMA.

1234
01:13:27,219 --> 01:13:30,097
What did that night
before leaving?

1235
01:13:30,556 --> 01:13:32,057
Something like where it goes? Did he say anything?

1236
01:13:32,474 --> 01:13:36,187
Said... that goes to the house
Siya recovery.

Take the money.

1238

Honorable court, witness statement clearly indicates...

1239
01:13:42,110 --> 01:13:43,361
That the accused were familiar with the Siya.

1240

I mean... Niyaz a

1241
01:13:50,118 --> 01:13:53,455
That's all, honorable court.

1242
01:13:54,748 --> 01:13:58,668
Wait. Wait so.

Why do not you tell me that a

1244
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:02,839

Look... Siya
promised that I will refund your money.

1249
01:14:13,851 --> 01:14:14,310
I went there to take your money...

1250
01:14:14,810 --> 01:14:16,604
But when I got there, she was already dead.

1251
01:14:16,854 --> 01:14:18,773
I swear.

1252
01:14:19,232 --> 01:14:21,359
It was truly dead?

1253
01:14:21,859 --> 01:14:25,238
I was in the mood.

1254
01:14:30,535 --> 01:14:31,702
I wanted it right there... ****

1255
01:14:31,828 --> 01:14:36,249
But then he began to struggle.

1256
01:14:36,707 --> 01:14:40,086
And then raped her.

1257
01:14:42,631 --> 01:14:43,882
Had been a murder!

1258
01:14:44,341 --> 01:14:47,719
Because I knew that Siya could not remain silent.

1259
01:14:54,309 --> 01:14:57,604
That's all... happy?

1260
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:16,499
Seven million?

1261
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:20,378
Yes. After the old man dies, Niyaz will receive seven million
the police.

1262
01:15:20,837 --> 01:15:22,213
How can a drug dealer ..

1263
01:15:22,255 --> 01:15:22,964
Receive a police of seven million for his mother?

1264
01:15:23,423 --> 01:15:25,884
It's a very old insurance purchased in 1978.

1265
01:15:26,384 --> 01:15:28,970
Buy a certain Sheikh Abdul Rehman
of Dubai.

1266
01:15:29,387 --> 01:15:32,015
Oh, so this insurance is an old love
gift from his mother.

1267
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,600
And what if Niyaz is dead?

1268
01:15:33,933 --> 01:15:35,852
Money goes to the wife... Nazia.

1269
01:15:36,311 --> 01:15:37,562
- Nazia.
- Yes.

1270
01:15:38,021 --> 01:15:42,025
Oh... it's a new twist in the story.

1271
01:15:42,483 --> 01:15:45,654
Advocate Verma struggling to overcome defeat and became its purpose.

1272
01:15:46,197 --> 01:15:47,448
She can do whatever she wants, sir.

1273
01:15:47,698 --> 01:15:49,408
But Niyaz will be sentenced to death.

1274
01:15:49,909 --> 01:15:54,413
And anyway, I do not like to lose
after I arrived so far.

1275
01:15:54,914 --> 01:15:55,956
True.

1276
01:15:56,415 --> 01:15:59,418
Here's file, sir... the
that you've asked for yesterday.

1277
01:15:59,919 --> 01:16:01,337
Exactly the way you've wanted.

1278
01:16:01,795 --> 01:16:05,841
Abbas... it's a bad average.

1279
01:16:06,342 --> 01:16:09,637
No big nor small.

1280
01:16:14,016 --> 01:16:17,604
Thank you.

1281
01:16:18,063 --> 01:16:19,022
- Ms. Verma.
- Yes.

1282
01:16:19,523 --> 01:16:22,859
Courier for you.

1283
01:16:24,861 --> 01:16:26,780
Signs.

1284
01:16:27,322 --> 01:16:30,617
Thank you.

1285
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:40,085
That's false.

1286
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,587
But tomorrow Poth see the original.

1287
01:16:43,088 --> 01:16:46,133
And after this remaining sides of your daughter.

1288
01:16:46,592 --> 01:16:49,929
As this.

1289
01:16:54,475 --> 01:16:55,434
- Hello.
- Hello.

1290
01:16:55,685 --> 01:16:57,395
- How are you?
- I'm good.

1291
01:16:57,812 --> 01:16:58,771
What have you learned about Nazia?

1292
01:16:59,313 --> 01:17:00,523
Look, the situation is so kind...

1293
01:17:01,023 --> 01:17:03,546
Niyaz that if it dies in prison or sentenced to death
...

1294
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:06,070
Then Nazia will receive seven million rupees in insurance.

1295
01:17:06,529 --> 01:17:09,907
And for this she stated
against him in court.

1296
01:17:25,966 --> 01:17:29,219
Yohaan, to meet the Cross!

1297
01:17:29,678 --> 01:17:32,931
So you said that Sam was in the hospital
your Lulie 26, 2013

1298
01:17:33,390 --> 01:17:34,474
Not what you say you? - Yes.

1299
01:17:34,933 --> 01:17:37,102
What is this?

1300
01:17:37,603 --> 01:17:39,521
Sam
Siya was a funeral on August 19.

1301
01:17:39,980 --> 01:17:41,690
If your hospital was, then how could he be
a funeral?

1302
01:17:42,232 --> 01:17:43,407
That's a fucking
double-role?

1303
01:17:43,442 --> 01:17:46,404
Well, in our
hospital records, he was in the hospital that day.

1304
01:17:46,863 --> 01:17:47,947
We want to meet with Sam.

1305
01:17:48,281 --> 01:17:49,699
Only he can tell us where it was.

1306
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:52,202
It's not possible.
It was released.

1307
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:54,537
How do you release the condition
is it?

1308
01:17:54,996 --> 01:17:57,665
We must have a guardian
if we say so.

1309
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:59,292
Who is his guardian?

1310
01:17:59,792 --> 01:18:01,336
Can not have your say
hospital policy.

1311
01:18:01,794 --> 01:18:03,379
Personal information are confidential.

1312
01:18:03,546 --> 01:18:04,547
Lady...

1313
01:18:04,923 --> 01:18:06,925
Please be clear if it
is about give and take.

1314
01:18:07,383 --> 01:18:08,343
And I can give something.

1315
01:18:08,426 --> 01:18:10,053
I'm sorry, but that does not work
here.

1316
01:18:10,088 --> 01:18:11,054
What then?

1317
01:18:11,429 --> 01:18:12,889
What kind of powerful guardian was he...

1318
01:18:12,931 --> 01:18:15,350
Which was released before treatment to completely
?

1319
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:18,520
I want to see the hospital records.

1320
01:18:18,555 --> 01:18:21,190
For this you need a warrant.

1321
01:18:21,649 --> 01:18:23,859
If you were not a woman,
I would have slapped you right now.

1322
01:18:24,401 --> 01:18:26,195
Out!

1323
01:18:26,654 --> 01:18:28,948
Come Yohaan.

1324
01:18:29,448 --> 01:18:32,409
Only those without password
Mobile are honest.

1325
01:18:32,868 --> 01:18:35,120
This lady is involved 100%.

1326
01:18:35,579 --> 01:18:35,996
Ram...

1327
01:18:36,497 --> 01:18:38,999
- Sir, I found the yellow car, Nano.
- Very good.

1328
01:18:39,500 --> 01:18:41,293
- Siya car was found.
- Thank God.

1329
01:18:41,377 --> 01:18:43,087
I'll get a warrant,
and I find them where Sam ..

1330
01:18:43,128 --> 01:18:46,465
Headed up by
graveyard of cars immediately.

1331
01:18:57,811 --> 01:19:02,899
- That yellow?
- Yes. Therefore.

1332
01:19:03,358 --> 01:19:06,736
Wait.

1333
01:19:38,352 --> 01:19:41,147
This... is the safe
a nose ring.

1334
01:19:41,606 --> 01:19:44,317
Then Sam told me that
know who killed Siya?

1335
01:19:44,775 --> 01:19:47,403
's Very possible that he does not know what to do.

1336
01:19:47,904 --> 01:19:51,366
Drugs that you take...
creates hallucinations.

1337
01:19:51,825 --> 01:19:53,994
But he must and remember
awake once again.

1338
01:19:54,119 --> 01:19:55,621
And will not remember anything.

1339
01:19:56,079 --> 01:19:58,499
Even if someone hacked into pieces when it was smoked
...

1340
01:19:58,957 --> 01:20:00,215
He did not and will remember later.

1341
01:20:00,250 --> 01:20:01,752
In any case, DNA analysis is complete.

1342
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:04,880
But we will need a monster of Sam.

1343
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:06,548
Blood, hair?

1344
01:20:06,965 --> 01:20:08,258
Compare analyzes.

1345
01:20:08,675 --> 01:20:09,968
I have one at home.

1346
01:20:10,469 --> 01:20:12,596
I have a blood sample of the
Sam on a piece of paper.

1347
01:20:12,638 --> 01:20:16,934
- It will be helpful?
- Of course.

1348
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:18,025
Hello.

1349
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:20,438
Anu, I found something.

1350
01:20:20,897 --> 01:20:21,856
What?

1351
01:20:22,023 --> 01:20:23,816
I made an unofficial check on Sam.

1352
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:25,610
Have you heard about Mahesh Maklai?

1353
01:20:26,069 --> 01:20:28,863
- MP.
- He's his father.

1354
01:20:29,364 --> 01:20:34,327
He hid him for
Sam to save and political career.

1355
01:20:34,786 --> 01:20:36,412
This case becomes a big mess.

1356
01:20:36,871 --> 01:20:40,250
I wonder what else might occur.

1357
01:20:47,465 --> 01:20:53,055
Welcome, lawyer Verma, how are you?

1358
01:20:53,597 --> 01:20:56,851
You said... "
Pray do not we meet again."

1359
01:20:57,393 --> 01:20:58,519
I made a...

1360
01:20:59,019 --> 01:21:03,190
But what to do,
our prayers are never answered.

1361
01:21:03,732 --> 01:21:07,027
Mahesh Maklai sent you?

1362
01:21:09,071 --> 01:21:14,702
Sorry, lawyer Verma.
I came uninvited.

1363
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:18,706
There was a decent thing,
but it was necessary.

1364
01:21:19,164 --> 01:21:22,544
Luck.

1365
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,171
Yes, officer.

1366
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,423
- Mr.
- Someone came to see him on Niyaz?

1367
01:21:26,464 --> 01:21:27,799
- Someone did it yesterday!
- Yesterday?

1368
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:29,050
Yes.

1369
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:30,218
Who?

1370
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,761
Sir, his name is Vijay Madgaonkar.

1371
01:21:31,803 --> 01:21:32,762
Vijay Madgaonkar.

1372
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:34,681
Absolutely correct, sir.

1373
01:21:35,098 --> 01:21:37,684
It's not the same guy you arrested for kidnapping of Mandara
?

1374
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,060
Absolutely correct, sir
. He's right.

1375
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:40,437
When it was released?

1376
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:41,521
Now six months.

1377
01:21:41,813 --> 01:21:43,356
You'll find the village Versova.

1378
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:44,566
- Where?
- Versova Village.

1379
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:45,615
Versova Village.

1380
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:48,987
- Ok, thanks.
- Yes, sir.

1381
01:21:52,658 --> 01:21:55,786
My son has nothing to do with this case.

1382
01:21:56,245 --> 01:21:58,915
And why you faked
hospital records.

1383
01:21:59,415 --> 01:22:01,417
And when I started investigation...

1384
01:22:01,876 --> 01:22:03,211
've Released immediately.

1385
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:07,340
You do not understand...

1386
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,884
Came home stoned morning.

1387
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:13,763
The car's girlfriend
Siya... with her body.

1388
01:22:21,145 --> 01:22:22,104
You're crazy?

1389
01:22:22,439 --> 01:22:25,526
What did you do?

1390
01:22:25,943 --> 01:22:28,529
What did you do?

1391
01:22:28,987 --> 01:22:31,698
It's very unfortunate and sad...

1392
01:22:32,157 --> 01:22:33,325
Killer is someone else...

1393
01:22:33,575 --> 01:22:34,826
I mean Niyaz.

1394
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:38,247
Right now resembles more... Sam killer.

1395
01:22:38,705 --> 01:22:41,542
That's why I came here
at this late hour.

1396
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:44,586
Drugs they put my son in a really bad situation...

1397
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:48,173
And in the morning when Siya died, my son thought...

1398
01:22:48,715 --> 01:22:51,218
That I killed Siya.

1399
01:22:51,718 --> 01:22:54,180
That's stupid that was
Siya funeral.

1400
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,183
And when I found out...

1401
01:22:57,642 --> 01:23:01,229
I put the papers Teaching
recovery.

1402
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:02,814
What are you doing?

1403
01:23:03,231 --> 01:23:04,899
Turns it. Please, don't do that.

1404
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:08,778
What are you doing?

1405
01:23:10,488 --> 01:23:12,907
Can Sam killer,
do not. Please...

1406
01:23:13,408 --> 01:23:14,701
What importance does it have?

1407
01:23:15,159 --> 01:23:17,036
The next year will be the tournament
election.

1408
01:23:17,537 --> 01:23:20,039
Whether or not that Sam
killer, who cares?

1409
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:23,878
What matters is that such a scandal
can ruin my career.

1410
01:23:34,555 --> 01:23:35,514
What are you doing?

1411
01:23:35,723 --> 01:23:39,226
Turns it, please.

1412
01:23:39,685 --> 01:23:42,354
I told... îþi remembers?

1413
01:23:42,813 --> 01:23:46,192
What happened
never before, it will happen someday.

1414
01:23:52,865 --> 01:23:54,116
- Abbas.
- Yes.

1415
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:57,954
- You The pipe cut gas?
- I cut it.

1416
01:24:31,239 --> 01:24:34,617
- You're ok?
- Yes I'm good.

1417
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:45,586
Oh, God!

1418
01:25:51,738 --> 01:25:53,281
- That's your dog?
- No.

1419
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:54,557
Who you are?

1420
01:25:54,657 --> 01:25:59,955
Father that I am yours,
about your mom said not logged in.

1421
01:26:00,414 --> 01:26:02,541
If he's not your dog,
then why not bark at you?

1422
01:26:02,576 --> 01:26:05,920
He barks only at policemen.

1423
01:26:34,741 --> 01:26:36,910
Where's the girl?

1424
01:26:37,369 --> 01:26:40,121
Where's the girl?

1425
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:44,793
Where's the girl?

1426
01:26:45,252 --> 01:26:46,169
Where's the girl?

1427
01:26:46,211 --> 01:26:49,831
Where's the girl?

1428
01:26:52,717 --> 01:26:53,718
You will never find front.

1429
01:26:54,094 --> 01:26:57,430
Never!

1430
01:27:19,161 --> 01:27:21,372
Anuradha Verma's life.

1431
01:27:21,831 --> 01:27:26,377
I apologize, I think my boys
and have emerged from form.

1432
01:27:26,878 --> 01:27:27,837
It's okay.

1433
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:31,550
Some get better with age,
while others become worse.

1434
01:27:36,930 --> 01:27:39,391
This is my son, Sam.

1435
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:42,269
I want him safe dom of
for a while.

1436
01:27:42,728 --> 01:27:45,522
This time there's no room...

1437
01:27:46,064 --> 01:27:47,149
For any mistake yet.

1438
01:27:47,608 --> 01:27:49,234
Do not get your worry...

1439
01:27:49,735 --> 01:27:53,113
Now your son is my secret.

1440
01:28:01,331 --> 01:28:04,709
I'll be free!

1441
01:28:09,172 --> 01:28:12,425
Where do we meet?

1442
01:28:12,926 --> 01:28:15,178
Ready! Ready! Ready!

1443
01:28:15,595 --> 01:28:19,015
I'll be a free bird.

1444
01:28:21,893 --> 01:28:23,811
Traces of steps and fingerprints
studio Siya...

1445
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:25,688
And fingerprints from her wallet.

1446
01:28:25,897 --> 01:28:29,692
These are all strong evidence that does not allow for any doubt...

1447
01:28:30,193 --> 01:28:32,446
That Niyaz has killed Siya.

1448
01:28:32,947 --> 01:28:35,783
And his old cases, including rape...

1449
01:28:36,242 --> 01:28:40,829
And exploitation of women for their lust...

1450
01:28:41,288 --> 01:28:44,792
These files are enough to prove his motive.

1451
01:28:45,251 --> 01:28:46,919
That's all,
honorable court.

1452
01:28:47,336 --> 01:28:49,880
Honorable court after the prosecution admits
as...

1453
01:28:50,339 --> 01:28:56,428
Siya murderers can this Niyaz.

1454
01:28:56,887 --> 01:28:57,847
Silence.

1455
01:28:57,888 --> 01:28:59,056
Defence, please continue.

1456
01:28:59,473 --> 01:29:01,977
As I said, even according to my investigations...

1457
01:29:02,394 --> 01:29:04,187
Siya Niyaz can be killer.

1458
01:29:04,646 --> 01:29:08,149
For information Court, Niyaz
usual to supply drugs Siya.

1459
01:29:08,650 --> 01:29:11,403
But these drugs were for Siya friend Sam.

1460
01:29:11,862 --> 01:29:16,658
And that night
Niyaz had come to meet Sam.

1461
01:29:17,158 --> 01:29:17,934
You?

1462
01:29:18,034 --> 01:29:20,203
Sam  commodity demand something, I want money.

1463
01:29:20,662 --> 01:29:22,205
Wait.

1464
01:29:22,664 --> 01:29:26,042
That means that another person was present there during
crime.

1465
01:29:40,433 --> 01:29:41,601
What are you doing here?

1466
01:29:42,143 --> 01:29:44,437
- Here.
- Thank you.

1467
01:29:44,937 --> 01:29:45,897
Leave.

1468
01:29:46,022 --> 01:29:47,815
- It's new merchandise, you have a guºti?
- No thanks.

1469
01:29:47,982 --> 01:29:51,277
- Go.
- It's good.

1470
01:29:57,241 --> 01:30:00,578
Sam. Sam. Sam. Wakes up yourself,
Sam. Sam, please wakes up yourself.

1471
01:31:13,946 --> 01:31:16,198
Only make assumptions Defense Council, honorable court.

1472
01:31:16,615 --> 01:31:18,075
There's no evidence to suggest...

1473
01:31:18,534 --> 01:31:20,744
Sam was present that night of the murder.

1474
01:31:21,245 --> 01:31:24,039
Absolutely correct, honorable
court. There is no trial.

1475
01:31:24,498 --> 01:31:28,085
And it's also true that what I just said
are just guesses.

1476
01:31:28,502 --> 01:31:30,129
And I have no hard evidence.

1477
01:31:30,546 --> 01:31:33,841
But the prosecution has any evidence against my client
solid?

1478
01:31:34,301 --> 01:31:35,385
I mean... the murder weapon.

1479
01:31:35,635 --> 01:31:38,263
That said cutter carved so... what has fingerprints
my client...

1480
01:31:38,298 --> 01:31:39,222
Where is it?

1481
01:31:39,347 --> 01:31:41,933
It is the responsibility of the prosecution to prove guilt
my client.

1482
01:31:42,434 --> 01:31:44,686
The prosecution already admitted...

1483
01:31:45,228 --> 01:31:48,023
Fingerprints and traces the steps of his Niyaz found at the scene.

1484
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,649
Traces of steps and fingerprints...

1485
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:52,068
Can not be accepted as evidence
solid, honorable court.

1486
01:31:52,103 --> 01:31:53,486
As long as the prosecution does not present...

1487
01:31:53,945 --> 01:31:56,031
Accused murder weapon fingerprints on it.

1488
01:31:56,489 --> 01:31:58,658
Until then accused
can not be proven guilty.

1489
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:01,161
And now Sam was also there that night.

1490
01:32:01,203 --> 01:32:02,204
Anyone can be killer.

1491
01:32:02,704 --> 01:32:04,414
Just because Niyaz's drug dealer...

1492
01:32:04,873 --> 01:32:06,751
's Convenient for law to suspect him.

1493
01:32:07,251 --> 01:32:09,545
But Sam... is the son of a rich father...

1494
01:32:10,046 --> 01:32:12,048
Which has good connections in the system.

1495
01:32:12,465 --> 01:32:15,801
That's... not felt
police need to investigate it.

1496
01:32:16,260 --> 01:32:19,764
Even though we have believed for a while that Sam
killed Siya...

1497
01:32:20,223 --> 01:32:25,394
Then raised the question, why
Sam and killed his girlfriend...

1498
01:32:25,811 --> 01:32:27,021
He loved so much?

1499
01:32:27,396 --> 01:32:28,356
What was the reason?

1500
01:32:28,648 --> 01:32:31,359
Seeing the Siya and Niyaz
in a position compromiþãtoare...

1501
01:32:31,817 --> 01:32:33,444
Sam and he lost control.

1502
01:32:33,903 --> 01:32:37,157
And maybe... he killed
Siya in a huff.

1503
01:32:37,616 --> 01:32:39,576
Market was already being smoked...
drug addict.

1504
01:32:39,826 --> 01:32:42,663
At least Niyaz's fingerprints were found at the scene.

1505
01:32:43,163 --> 01:32:45,040
Defense Council has any trial...

1506
01:32:45,499 --> 01:32:48,794
To suggest that Sam was
Currently there that night?

1507
01:32:49,253 --> 01:32:52,256
A... sample, lawyer Verma.

1508
01:32:52,714 --> 01:32:56,093
We have evidence, honorable court.

1509
01:33:07,438 --> 01:33:09,941
I apologize...

1510
01:33:10,441 --> 01:33:13,027
But I would like to ask Court...

1511
01:33:13,486 --> 01:33:15,280
Listen to it for liberating justice.

1512
01:33:15,446 --> 01:33:17,365
Please.

1513
01:33:17,824 --> 01:33:21,202
Honorable court, please.

1514
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:30,628
The night was killed
Siya, were there?

1515
01:33:31,129 --> 01:33:32,881
You were there?

1516
01:33:32,964 --> 01:33:33,756
Yes.

1517
01:33:33,882 --> 01:33:35,508
You killed Siya?

1518
01:33:35,967 --> 01:33:40,514
No... when I
high, she was dead.

1519
01:33:40,931 --> 01:33:44,351
Someone killed her and had left there.

1520
01:34:06,916 --> 01:34:07,876
So what do you do?

1521
01:34:08,126 --> 01:34:11,504
I took her body home!

1522
01:34:19,346 --> 01:34:22,891
And then your father, Mahesh Maklai
to cleanse your body with alcohol...

1523
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:26,728
And threw him in the ocean
to get rid of him.

1524
01:34:56,676 --> 01:34:58,386
Answer me Sam.

1525
01:34:58,803 --> 01:35:02,181
Yes.

1526
01:35:04,308 --> 01:35:05,268
That's honorable court.

1527
01:35:05,685 --> 01:35:11,483
That means the killer may be Niyaz or Sam.

1528
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:13,652
But the true murderer can be found...

1529
01:35:13,986 --> 01:35:16,238
Only when the weapon is found...

1530
01:35:16,697 --> 01:35:18,115
Having criminalulul fingerprints.

1531
01:35:18,615 --> 01:35:20,576
But Sam and his father
millionaire, Mahesh Maklai...

1532
01:35:21,034 --> 01:35:26,123
I am guilty of all crimes committed after the murder.

1533
01:35:26,582 --> 01:35:28,333
Moving the body from the scene.

1534
01:35:28,792 --> 01:35:30,085
's Cleaning with alcohol...

1535
01:35:30,544 --> 01:35:32,629
And then throwing it into the sea to get rid of it.

1536
01:35:32,921 --> 01:35:36,633
That proves incontrovertibly
crimes Sam's and Mahesh Maklai.

1537
01:35:37,092 --> 01:35:39,637
Request to the Court to reopen the case.

1538
01:35:40,096 --> 01:35:42,473
And to free the customer
my Niyaz on bail...

1539
01:35:42,932 --> 01:35:45,393
Until the real killer is found.

1540
01:35:45,852 --> 01:35:49,022
Niyaz paid a big mess and compen
for his past crimes.

1541
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,900
I'm not saying be paid...

1542
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:56,988
But cauþiunea is his right legally, and should receive it.

1543
01:35:57,488 --> 01:35:59,741
Thank you, honorable court.

1544
01:36:00,241 --> 01:36:01,659
Court hotãrãºte...

1545
01:36:02,118 --> 01:36:07,707
..Mahesh Maklai and Sam Maklai be take into police custody.

1546
01:36:08,208 --> 01:36:11,545
The accused is released on bail Niyaz.

1547
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:28,062
Ms. Verma... I told...

1548
01:36:28,562 --> 01:36:30,564
Abbas may have many faults...

1549
01:36:31,023 --> 01:36:34,443
Tighten but always pays his debts.

1550
01:36:34,944 --> 01:36:38,864
Farewell.

1551
01:36:39,365 --> 01:36:40,783
I'm sorry, sir Maklai.

1552
01:36:41,284 --> 01:36:44,663
Some people do not change with time, they become worse.

1553
01:36:54,714 --> 01:36:55,882
Niyaz, where're?

1554
01:36:56,424 --> 01:36:58,385
I emerged from prison.

1555
01:36:58,802 --> 01:37:00,720
I am a free bird!
I am a free bird!

1556
01:37:01,221 --> 01:37:02,514

In parking.

Come on... come on...

1565

This is my daughter.

1566
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:41,783
No, no, no, no.

1567
01:38:42,242 --> 01:38:45,621
Sanaya!

1568
01:38:51,877 --> 01:38:55,297
Sanaya!

1569
01:38:56,507 --> 01:39:02,012

Please wakes up yourself.

Wake up yourself.

1575

01:39:43,847 --> 01:39:47,143
Mother.

1577
01:39:47,643 --> 01:39:50,980
I was afraid.

1578
01:39:53,149 --> 01:39:56,527
I miss you, Mom.

1579
01:40:06,370 --> 01:40:09,707
My baby.

1580
01:40:17,382 --> 01:40:20,928
... Joe

1581
01:40:21,386 --> 01:40:25,974
To draw a killer and rapist in jail?

1582
01:40:26,516 --> 01:40:28,310
That Vijay...

1583
01:40:28,769 --> 01:40:32,147
He has the key to this lock.

1584
01:41:05,682 --> 01:41:08,977
Hey... Wait!

1585
01:41:16,986 --> 01:41:20,364
-Moving-moving....

1586
01:41:38,173 --> 01:41:39,592
Tell me who forced you were doing.

1587
01:41:40,009 --> 01:41:41,010
Tell me everything.

1588
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:44,597
Îþi Îþi will tell... I will tell everything.

1589
01:41:52,939 --> 01:41:54,649
Can I come in?

1590
01:41:55,108 --> 01:41:59,237
It will only take a few minutes, please.

1591
01:41:59,738 --> 01:42:03,241
I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Garima.

1592
01:42:03,742 --> 01:42:06,036
But they had taken on my Sanaya.

1593
01:42:06,536 --> 01:42:08,914
And I never had...

1594
01:42:09,414 --> 01:42:12,459
No other option than to accept their conditions.

1595
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:16,630
Know the pain of losing someone, Ms. Garima.

1596
01:42:17,130 --> 01:42:19,967
But ...

1597
01:42:20,384 --> 01:42:23,387
I had the freedom to express my pain.

1598

1603
01:42:42,448 --> 01:42:45,535
I almost lost it once.

1604

I have given something to eat...
to which she was allergic.

1605
01:42:50,916 --> 01:42:53,043
It could even die if I do not I would be...

01:42:53,544 --> 01:42:56,880
Reached for medicine.

A death... which
not logged a Poth imagine.

1624

01:45:30,622 --> 01:45:33,917
Remind all of Ravan's crimes.

1626
