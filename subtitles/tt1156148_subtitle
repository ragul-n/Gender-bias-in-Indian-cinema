''So how are you, my sweet, innocent,
little foolish sister?!''

68
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:01,741
''
Brother, are you drunk?''

69
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,002
Not at all.
- Don't lie!

70
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:09,147
Elders say alcohol destroys families.

71
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:11,847
''Listen, l'm having just one beer.
lt doesn't harm anyone.''

And listen, don't tell mom.''

73
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:17,621
''Brother, l'm very angry. Why didn't
you call for so many days?''

74
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,659
l'll tell you tomorrow when l return.

75
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:20,784
You want something from here?

76
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,556
You come soon. We want nothing else.

77
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,560

Okay, brother. See you tomorrow!''

78

79
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,157
l love you too!

80
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:33,034
''
Priest, has the idol been placed?''

81
00:06:33,707 --> 00:06:35,607
''
All the rituals are completed, Mother.''

82
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:37,800
Only the sacred vessel
remains to be kept.

83
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,638
Then you can start the veneration
in the temple.

84
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,806
Find an auspicious time tomorrow.

85
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:45,882
My son is coming tomorrow.

86
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,680
l'm making this temple on his behalf.

87
00:06:48,855 --> 00:06:51,050
He will place the sacred vessel
in the temple himself. - Okay.

88
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:13,000
Wow! lt's a beautiful tune!
Who's made it?

89
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:15,114
A guy named John who
works in our estate.

90
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:19,114
He hums this tune every morning.

91
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:20,277
l've been hearing it since childhood.

92
00:07:20,553 --> 00:07:23,613
Now it feels like it won't be morning
if John doesn't play this tune.

93
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:26,286
l love it! lt's really beautiful!

94
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:42,001
''Hi, John!
- Hello, sir!''

95
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:45,573
''Sorry sir, l didn't notice you
as l was busy with my tune.''

96
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,169
lt's alright. How
are you? All's well?

97
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:48,680
''
Yes, everything's alright, sir.''

98
00:07:48,748 --> 00:07:50,238
How are you?
- Fantastic!

99
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:53,717
''John, she's my wife, Kamini.
Kamini, he's John.''

100
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:58,019
''Hello. - Hello, ma'am! l wish
you a very happy married life.''

101
00:07:58,124 --> 00:07:59,182
''Thank you.
- Thank you, John!''

102
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:00,783
''
Thank you! See you around, sir!''

103
00:08:21,714 --> 00:08:23,181
''
C'mon, sweetheart. Don't be scared.''

104
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:26,343
Here we go.

105
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:30,355
Okay then you're set!

106
00:08:31,024 --> 00:08:33,618
''You know, Kamini, the properties
l showed you..''

107
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:36,355
..while driving are all ours.

108
00:08:36,696 --> 00:08:37,958
We have some of the best
vineyards in the world.

109
00:08:38,031 --> 00:08:39,362
We make some of the best wines.

110
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:42,634
''And sweetheart, since you've
come into my life..''

111
00:08:42,702 --> 00:08:44,067
..l seem to be doing well.

112
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,701
You are the best!

113
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:53,837
Okay then..

114
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:58,817
''So baby, are you ready for
the flight of your life?!''

115
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:01,916
''Yes, l am.
- That's good!''

116
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,854
And up we go!

117
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:13,890
Successful take off.

118
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:29,411
''Hey Kamini, look down.
That's our brewery.''

119
00:09:30,683 --> 00:09:33,049
And adjacent to it is
our seeding plant.

120
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,221
''Wow!
- Lovely, isn't it?''

121
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:40,056
''And in a while, you'll come across
Mother Kali's temple.''

122
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:42,018
My mother is building it for me.

123
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:46,790
''
Why are you so quiet, sweetheart?''

124
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:50,431
Don't be tensed. l'm a fantastic
pilot. l'm safe.

125
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:57,368
You must be thinking about how my
mom will react when she sees you.

126
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:00,303
Find out once we reach home!

127
00:10:00,446 --> 00:10:02,812
She will love you a lot.

128
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:05,849
''Daughter-in-law, sit here.
Daughter-in-law, sit there.''

129
00:10:06,185 --> 00:10:07,812
''Daughter-in-law, don't
sit near the AC!''

130
00:10:08,254 --> 00:10:09,778
Daughter-in-law is suffering
from cold!

131
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:11,050
Call the doctor immediately!

132
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:14,716
She isn't aware that the
daughter-in-law's..

133
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:17,228
..do not like interference
these days! lsn't it?

134
00:10:25,371 --> 00:10:27,100
Oh! What happened to this?

135
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,134
Oh..

136
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:36,008
The fuel..

137
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:42,317
''Kamini, wear the parachute
behind your seat.''

138
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,824
l've already worn the parachute.
- Good.

139
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,827
Oh no. We're losing
height very fast..

140
00:10:49,228 --> 00:10:51,025
''Kamini, don't worry,
nothing will happen.''

141
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:53,132
l'll not let anything happen to you.

142
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:05,943
''Kamini, there's one more
parachute behind my seat.''

143
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:07,170
Hand it to me quickly.

144
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:10,942
Your parachute is lying
exactly where l threw it.

145
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:14,444
''What kind of ajoke
is this, Kamini?!''

146
00:11:14,854 --> 00:11:15,912
Where's the parachute?!

147
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:17,948
Oh no!

148
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,217
Don't waste more time on this.

149
00:11:21,961 --> 00:11:23,792
When you were checking
the safe in the alder..

150
00:11:23,863 --> 00:11:25,854
..l disabled the fuel gauge.

151
00:11:25,932 --> 00:11:28,059
The plane is about to crash soon.
- What?!

152
00:11:28,801 --> 00:11:33,033
''l'll miss you, my love.
- Kamini! Kamini!''

153
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,881
There was just one parachute
in the plane..

154
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:04,089
..and Ravi sacrificed himself
while trying to save me.

155
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:11,062
l saw my husband dying and
l couldn't do anything.

156
00:13:11,137 --> 00:13:12,263
l couldn't do anything..

157
00:13:14,907 --> 00:13:16,033
Brother!

158
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:20,570
Brother!

159
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:23,508
Brother!

160
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:27,477
Brother!

161
00:13:36,662 --> 00:13:38,152
No. This can't happen.

162
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,393
Such injustice can't happen.

163
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,535
You can't go leaving me behind.

164
00:13:53,513 --> 00:13:58,007
You promised me that
you would come back.

165
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:07,687
''But not this way. Not this way,
my son! Not this way..''

166
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:13,423
''No! No, l won't let you go!
- Brother! Brother!''

167
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,461
l'll go with you! Leave me! Leave me!

168
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:21,268
l want to go with him. Leave me!

169
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:32,048
''l ask you, why did you take

- Why?

220

Hi! Good evening, uncle!''

- He's an orphan. lt doesn't matter.

''Good evening, ma'am.
- Mr. Phillips!''

235
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:20,023
Monty is my son. My son.
My sweet son.

236
00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:24,060
''Monty, are you hurt
by what he said?!''

237
00:21:24,129 --> 00:21:26,097
You know how he is after he drinks!

238
00:21:26,165 --> 00:21:27,598
He reaches Jalandhar when
he's not in his senses!

239
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:31,193
''Started again.
- Hey. Come on, leave that!''

240
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:35,070
''lt's too much! Too much! Come on,
Let's go. - Just a little..''

241
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:38,007
l belong to lakhs of people
but no one belongs to me.

242
00:21:38,677 --> 00:21:43,046
lf l can say someone
belongs to me then its Mrs. Oberoi.

243
00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:46,479
''l have everything!
Name, fame, money!''

244
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,112
The only thing that
l don't have is my mother.

245
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:53,685
l don't even know what a
mother or her love is.

246
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:55,954
''
Dayal, if l had my mother with me..''

247
00:21:56,028 --> 00:22:02,058
..l would give up everything for her.

248
00:22:04,269 --> 00:22:06,965
''Monty, my friend, l've known
you for a long time..''

249
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,031
..but for the first time l've felt
the pain you are going through.

250

''
Come on, Monty! Life has to go on.''

251

''Come on! l know this keeps happening,
but Monty, you're a rock star!''

252
00:22:17,049 --> 00:22:18,107
You can do better!

253
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,252
''Monty, smile once! You laughed!
Laughed! Laughed!''

254
00:22:23,389 --> 00:22:24,515
Will you do a favour for me?

255
00:22:25,057 --> 00:22:26,115
What is it?

256
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,992
''You know my boss, Dr. Daniel.
He's hosting a party..''

257
00:22:29,061 --> 00:22:32,155
..tomorrow at Monsoon Lagoon
and if you come there then..

258
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:34,989
What's happening? Keep those
champagne glasses..

259
00:22:35,067 --> 00:22:36,534
..along with those
champagne bottles!

260
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:38,502
''Come on, this is our
last examination!''

261
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,697
''We have to rock this party!
Girls, hurry up!''

262
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:43,007
lf you don't score well
this year then..

263
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:46,602
..you'll have to listen to what
that boring principal says.

264
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,307
''Girls, what's wrong with you all?
Why are you all staring at me?''

265
00:22:53,118 --> 00:22:55,678
''Not you, l'm looking at
Monty, the rock star!''

266
00:22:56,188 --> 00:22:58,486
Look! Right in front of you.

267
00:23:16,475 --> 00:23:20,275
''lmpossible! Rock-star Monty
and that too, all alone!''

268
00:23:21,146 --> 00:23:22,204
Let me check it out.

269
00:23:31,924 --> 00:23:35,223
''Excuse me, is Dr. Daniel hosting
his party in this club?''

270
00:23:39,465 --> 00:23:42,059
He's a duplicate..
- Excuse me!

271
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:47,305
Do you just look like Monty
or do you sing like him too?

272
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:53,903
''Look, l'm asking you about Dr.
Daniels' party and its location.''

273
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:56,870
''
The party's here, but it's at 8:30.''

274
00:23:56,949 --> 00:24:01,318
''Yes, it's 8:30 right now. - Your
watch is a fake. Just like you!''

275
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:03,913
7:30.

276
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:08,417
What's your name?

277
00:24:10,095 --> 00:24:14,293
Monty. - So you feigned the
name along with his get-up!

278
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,767
God gave me a face similar
to him and l got..

279
00:24:16,835 --> 00:24:21,067
..a lot of suggestions to keep
Monty as my name and l kept it.

280
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,774
You aren't ashamed of
taking advantage..

281
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:25,776
..of someone's fame and success?

282
00:24:25,844 --> 00:24:28,779
l do feel ashamed but considering
my problems..

283
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,405
..l keep quiet.

284
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,913
lt's my bad luck to roam
around as his duplicate.

285
00:24:36,021 --> 00:24:37,784
Had l got the break
at the right time..

286
00:24:37,856 --> 00:24:40,791
..Monty would have
been my duplicate..

287
00:24:40,859 --> 00:24:43,919
..and would be standing here.

288
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:49,329
You couldn't have been Monty
even with ten breaks!

289
00:24:49,535 --> 00:24:52,368
You seem to be a big fan of his!
Have you ever met him?

290
00:24:52,437 --> 00:24:54,268
l've seen a lot of his
shows on the T.V.

291
00:24:54,807 --> 00:25:00,245
''Oh, you haven't met him, he's
so arrogant, egoistic..''

292
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,810
''Had you met him once,
you would have been..''

293
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:03,973
''
..not his, but a fan of mine.''

294
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:06,449
''Hey duplicate, l don't
want to talk to you!''

295
00:25:08,453 --> 00:25:13,186
And you shouldn't too! Good
girls don't act that way too.

296
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:15,289
Will you please shut up?!

297
00:25:16,261 --> 00:25:18,024
There's still some time
for the party to begin.

298
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:23,133
You can either wait here
or get lost! Duplicate!

299
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:31,035
''
Monty, sing a song!''

300
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:35,409

- Oh no! - Monty, sing a song for us!''

301
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,947
''
Coming to the point, guys..''

302
00:25:37,015 --> 00:25:38,949
..Monty's under a contract
with Mr. G.G. Oberoi.

303
00:25:39,017 --> 00:25:42,248
Hence he cannot sing at a private
party or a function.

304
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:44,215
Or else he'll have to pay his legal..

305
00:25:44,323 --> 00:25:49,124
''No. Monty, please sing a song
for us! Please! Please!''

306
00:25:49,194 --> 00:25:52,163
''
Please Monty, sing a song for us!''

307
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:53,289
What do l do now?

308
00:25:53,866 --> 00:25:56,528
Pack your bags. Regret later.

some practical assignment..

349

..from some catering
college in Kenya..

350

Cape Town. Her flight's at 11:30.

You can't insult me!

And you might need money, not me!''

359
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,370

- Look at him! He's insulting me!

364
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,478
What happened?

365
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:26,353
He's begun to take his own
decisions these days!

366
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:31,259
Come here. Why don't you leave
your foolishness! - Foolishness?

367
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:33,694
He's very profitable to us.

l can't seem to get it.

376
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:13,470
You sang such a wonderful song
the other day at the party.

377
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:16,063
My friends couldn't stop
talking about it!

378
00:33:16,808 --> 00:33:19,800
''Look, here are a few
snaps of that party.''

379
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:24,743
Thanks. - You know..

380
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,350
My friends said that you
couldn't have sung..

381

''..such a wonderful song,
had l not inspired you!''

382
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:38,354

be some inspiration..''

383

..to write and sing a song, right?''

384
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:46,993

405

You've seen an aircraft crash.

406
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:27,302
There was a girl in it.
Do you know her?

407
00:39:29,147 --> 00:39:31,809
Have you seen that palace
in your past..

408
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:34,181
..in your childhood or in any movie?

409
00:39:35,386 --> 00:39:38,913
Then how can such images
or visuals come to you?

410
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,028

playing my guitar..''

411
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:49,830

have the guitar here, please?''

00:39:49,901 --> 00:39:50,959

This time l saw something else too.

417
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:12,046
A temple. There's an idol of
Goddess Kali in that temple.

418
00:41:13,618 --> 00:41:15,677
l saw that girl once again.

419
00:41:17,288 --> 00:41:19,279
She was hugging someone.

420
00:41:24,295 --> 00:41:29,289
''Dr. Dayal, the visuals Monty
saw have no relation to him.''

421
00:41:29,667 --> 00:41:34,127
lt could be that this is something
related to his past birth.

422
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:40,768
''Sir, you talk about rebirth
in this birth! Reincarnation!''

423
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:43,109
''
Dr. Shastri, you are really orthodox.''

424
00:41:44,315 --> 00:41:46,078
You don't seem to believe me.

425
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:49,676
l've practiced this for ten
years in a village in lndia.

426
00:41:50,154 --> 00:41:52,588
A five-year-old child
used to recite chants..

427
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:54,784
..from Ramayan and
Geeta in Sanskrit.

428
00:41:56,194 --> 00:41:58,594
And he even knew about his
parents and his house..

429
00:41:58,663 --> 00:42:00,961
..from his previous birth.

430
00:42:02,867 --> 00:42:05,335
''Even l didn't believe it then,
just like you don't believe me now.''

431
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:10,671
But l was stunned when
this was proved true.

432
00:42:10,741 --> 00:42:14,370
''Forget these old things, sir.
lt's a simple case of psychosis.''

433
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:17,946
''What happened, Monty?
- Oh my God! My son!''

434
00:42:18,015 --> 00:42:21,610
''Are you okay? - l'm the maker.
G.G Oberoi. Tell me, doctor.''

435
00:42:21,853 --> 00:42:23,445
''
Aunt, nothing's wrong with Monty.''

436
00:42:23,621 --> 00:42:24,679
He's just stressed out!

437
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:27,516
''He requires a month's rest,
that's it.''

438
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:33,630
Four weekends?! l would be at a loss
if he rests for even a month!

439
00:42:33,698 --> 00:42:35,427
l would incur a huge loss.

440
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:38,559
''Darling, don't be silly!
Leave your foolishness!''

441
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:40,829
You think of money all the time!

442
00:42:41,305 --> 00:42:44,035
''Monty, you're going on a
holiday from tomorrow.''

443
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:47,469
And l'll see who stops you.

444
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:52,414
''No, mom, no place can soothe
me without my music.''

445
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:55,744
lt can! One place can soothe you.

446
00:42:55,853 --> 00:42:57,582
And that's Kenya!
- Kenya?

447
00:42:57,922 --> 00:43:02,791
''Kenya, where your songs
are a super-hit!''

448
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:09,630
''Kenya! Kenya, a girl, Kenya..
- Oh..''

449
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:16,438

surely go to Kenya.''

00:48:10,868 --> 00:48:13,837
l'm Kabira.
- What do you want?

495
00:48:14,872 --> 00:48:17,841
''Shakal, Mogambo, tell me
everything about him.''

496
00:48:17,975 --> 00:48:20,842
Bank of Mambo. Credit
card number 400901.

497
00:48:20,978 --> 00:48:22,036
''
Debit balance, 15000.''

498
00:48:22,813 --> 00:48:24,713
He hasn't paid the E.M.l.
for the last four months.

499
00:48:24,915 --> 00:48:26,507
''
The total amount is 3,000.''

500
00:48:27,618 --> 00:48:32,783
Should l kill you or spare you?
Tell me what l should do.

501
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:35,390
''My village, my country!
- 1976!''

502
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:37,051
''Hero, Dharmendar.
- Super-hit!''

503
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:41,463
''
Kabira, please, spare me..''

504
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:50,004
Your two lifelines finish now.
l want only cash.

505
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:57,041
''
Give me a day's time, l'll..''

506
00:48:58,549 --> 00:49:01,484
''l'll give you three minutes,
not a day.''

507
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:07,089
There's a pawn shop there. Pawn
yourself if the need arises.

508
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:12,485
Or else Mogambo and
Shakal will kill you.

509
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,660
Go.

510
00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:20,963
''
C'mon, Roxy! Come! Come!''

511
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:22,430
C'mon!

512
00:49:24,074 --> 00:49:26,542
''
Kabira, your money.''

513
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:31,838
''What would you have done if it
was 30,000 instead of 3,000?''

514
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,845
Then l would have sold you too!

515
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:42,255
''
Kabira, you care a lot about Tina.''

516
00:49:42,426 --> 00:49:44,917
Not even real parents care so much.

517
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:48,796
Tina's no doubt my late friend
Mahesh's daughter..

518
00:49:48,866 --> 00:49:51,926
..but l love her more
than l love my family.

519
00:49:52,002 --> 00:49:56,803
''Oh little one, what kind
of relationships..''

520
00:49:56,874 --> 00:50:00,401
..and emotions are these?

521
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:02,478
''
A flower, two gardeners! -1968!''

522
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:05,538
That's right! - Golden jubilee!
- l didn't watch it!

523
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:06,942
''
One flower, two gardeners!''

524
00:50:07,484 --> 00:50:11,011
Flower! l remembered my
cute little daughters!

525
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:18,018
''Fun, laughter, smartness..
l cry when l think of them.''

526
00:50:18,329 --> 00:50:21,355
How long will my daughters
remain unmarried?

527
00:50:21,498 --> 00:50:24,228
Everything will be fine.
Have patience.

528
00:50:24,301 --> 00:50:28,567
Patience! Patience! You keep
postponing it by saying this.

529
00:50:29,006 --> 00:50:32,305
Who's Patience? lntroduce me to him.

530
00:50:32,509 --> 00:50:34,306
l'll make him my live-in son-in-law.

531
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:35,538
Patience! Patience!

532
00:50:35,846 --> 00:50:40,510
''By the way, how about Tina's studies?
- Excellent!''

533
00:50:40,584 --> 00:50:42,848
She's the best cook at our college.

534
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,889
She prepares delicious food!
People drool over it!

535
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,852
''My daughters cook too,
but l am searching..''

536
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:50,985
..for a guy to eat their food.

537
00:50:51,061 --> 00:50:53,188
Whom do they feed? They
eat it themselves!

538
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,094
Tina's not to be seen. Where is she?

539
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:57,258
She hasn't come to college today.

540
00:50:57,568 --> 00:51:00,332
She's not been here
for 15 to 20 days.

541
00:51:00,404 --> 00:51:03,168
15 to 20 days?!
- But she's a nice girl.

542
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:07,137
One should keep an eye on girls
at this age. - That's right.

543
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:09,406
l too keep an eye on my daughters!

544
00:51:10,114 --> 00:51:12,605
But there has to be someone
to keep an eye on..

545
00:51:12,916 --> 00:51:15,077
Whom should l keep an eye
on and what's the use?

546
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:30,790
''Monty, what if uncle
Kabir rejects you?''

547
00:51:31,935 --> 00:51:35,302
''
lf he does that, we will elope!''

548
00:51:45,616 --> 00:51:50,280
You respect elders all the time
or is this the first time?

549
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:52,312
''To tell you the truth, l'm doing
it for the first time.''

550
00:51:52,589 --> 00:51:57,652
Trying to impress me?
- No.

551
00:51:58,595 --> 00:52:00,187
l didn't have anybody to care
for me since childhood.

552
00:52:00,898 --> 00:52:06,336
And those who supported me aren't
even worth talking about.

553
00:52:07,938 --> 00:52:12,238
Do you know how the girl
you love leads her life?

554
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:16,636
l've made her every wish
or desire a reality.

555
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:19,639
She thinks that money
is of no concern.

556
00:52:23,954 --> 00:52:26,616
Kamal Kapoor had said that in
the film 'Chor Machaye Shor'..

557
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:27,748
..when Shashi Kapoor goes to talk..

558
00:52:27,825 --> 00:52:29,156
..about his marriage with Mumtaz.

559
00:52:33,363 --> 00:52:35,923
''But here, the situation
is exactly the opposite.''

560
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:39,363
You're such great rock star
and my daughter is a nobody.

561
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:41,864
l was confused since morning..

562
00:52:41,939 --> 00:52:44,999
..about the questions
l wanted to ask you.

563
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:47,874
''Uncle Kabir, the situation
was similar in 'Bobby'..''

564
00:52:47,945 --> 00:52:49,003
..when Rishi Kapoor goes to
talk about his marriage..

565
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,410
..with Dimple Kapadia.

566
00:52:51,315 --> 00:52:56,412
Oh my! That's true! How
did l forget that?!

567
00:52:56,887 --> 00:52:58,286
l've watched Bobby 15 times!

568
00:52:58,455 --> 00:53:00,923
''Why didn't you two remind me?!
- Sorry, sir.''

569
00:53:01,358 --> 00:53:04,885
You too watch a lot of
Hindi films..

570
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:07,157
..and hence could defeat me!

571
00:53:08,632 --> 00:53:11,624
''Look, son, l've experienced
a lot in life.''

572
00:53:12,302 --> 00:53:15,294
A person's eyes say a lot about him.

573
00:53:15,939 --> 00:53:17,167
l have only one request to make.

574
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:21,943
This girl doesn't have anyone
except me. Never hurt her.

575
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:23,643
Promise?
- Yes.

576
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:28,916
'Congratulations to everyone and
on this joyous occasion..

577
00:53:28,986 --> 00:53:30,476

lt's my own. My inner voice!

630

Who stays in that palace?

631
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:23,701
The Verma family used
to live there once.

632
00:59:24,007 --> 00:59:25,201
Now Princess Kamini occupies it.

633
00:59:31,348 --> 00:59:34,317
And this estate?
- lt belongs to Sir Juda.

634
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:36,417
He's a very famous business tycoon.

635
00:59:36,853 --> 00:59:38,946
lt once belonged to the
Verma family's son..

636
00:59:39,723 --> 00:59:45,059

everything was over. Over.

palace and you have to come.

l want to introduce you to someone.
- To whom?

654

step and the person..

..you will meet tonight..

656
01:02:11,374 --> 01:02:13,365

to allow us to marry.

- Sure.''

658
01:02:44,941 --> 01:02:45,999
Good evening.

659
01:02:47,844 --> 01:02:48,902
Hi! How are you?

660
01:02:49,879 --> 01:02:51,369
Hello. - Hi. Good evening.

661
01:02:52,382 --> 01:02:55,613
She's my guardian who will grant
us the permission to marry.

662
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:04,886
''
''''Let me love you..''

663
01:03:05,895 --> 01:03:09,626
''
..to my hearts content.''''''

664
01:03:10,467 --> 01:03:13,095
''
''''There is a dilemma in your eyes.''''''

665
01:03:13,236 --> 01:03:15,636
''
''''The heart is full of desires.''''''

666
01:03:16,639 --> 01:03:20,405
''
''''You gave me everything in love!''''''

667
01:03:21,144 --> 01:03:23,635
''
''''l was hurt by you.''''''

668
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:26,248
''
''''My emotions got swayed.''''''

669
01:03:27,117 --> 01:03:30,917
''
''''You gave me everything in love!''''''

670
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:35,481
''
''''l'll lose myself..''''''

671
01:03:36,493 --> 01:03:38,961
''
Hi, l'm Kamini.''

672
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:50,335
Princess Kamini..

673
01:03:52,675 --> 01:03:59,137
''
''''l shall lose my self to repay you.''''''

674
01:04:01,117 --> 01:04:02,175
Monty.

675
01:04:03,887 --> 01:04:07,288
Who doesn't know you..
l'm a fan of yours too.

676
01:04:08,291 --> 01:04:09,690
''
Are you here for a show, Monty?''

677
01:04:11,427 --> 01:04:14,362
No. l'm here on a holiday.

678
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:18,095
''
Well, then enjoy yourself.''

679
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:20,568
''Tina, take good care of him.
- l will.''

680
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:22,697
l'll see you later..

681
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:33,675
Shall we dance?

682
01:04:54,671 --> 01:04:56,138
Where's Princess Kamini's husband?

683
01:04:56,573 --> 01:04:59,474
He died in an accident
many years ago.

684
01:05:00,476 --> 01:05:04,037
Princess loved him so much
that she didn't remarry.

685
01:05:06,349 --> 01:05:07,509
Doesn't she feel lonely?

686
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,547
That's the least of
her concerns in life

687
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:12,354
Princess has sorted out her life.

688
01:05:12,422 --> 01:05:15,084
''Saturday nights are spent at
a casino, golf on Monday's..''

689
01:05:16,092 --> 01:05:19,425
..race on Tuesday's.
She keeps herself busy.

690
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:03,402
''Tina, darling, can l
borrow him from you?''

691
01:06:03,606 --> 01:06:07,940
''After all, such rock stars
don't grace my party everyday.''

692
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:10,907
''Of course, Princess.
He's all yours.''

693
01:06:12,215 --> 01:06:18,620
''
''''l'll lose myself..''''''

694
01:06:18,888 --> 01:06:26,090
''
''''l'll lose myself..''''''

695
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:37,602
Casablanca.
- Something different.

696
01:06:40,643 --> 01:06:45,512
''After a long time,
l'm hearing something so good.''

697
01:06:49,919 --> 01:06:54,379
''So, Mr. Monty?
How do you find our Kenya?''

698
01:06:56,626 --> 01:06:59,060
Feels as if l've known
this place for years.

699
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:01,124
Maybe l share a relationship
from a previous birth.

700
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:09,667
Come on! No relationship
is that bad.

701
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:13,941
Relationships can change
after the purpose..

702
01:07:14,010 --> 01:07:15,068
..they were made for is achieved.

703
01:07:16,646 --> 01:07:19,012
''You're quite an interesting
man, Mr. Monty.''

704
01:07:20,550 --> 01:07:22,211
''
You're no less either, Princess.''

705
01:07:24,253 --> 01:07:25,413
Absolutely deadly!

706
01:07:33,724 --> 01:07:35,157
l don't understand anything.

707
01:07:35,359 --> 01:07:38,692
''Forget others, even Kamini
won't believe..''

708
01:07:38,762 --> 01:07:42,721
..the kind of person she met
yesterday at the party.

709
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,227
''He's her husband from her
previous birth, Ravi Verma.''

710
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:48,094
''You don't need to tell me,
my friend. l believe you.''

711
01:07:48,372 --> 01:07:50,772
l believe everything you say.
- Thanks.

712
01:07:51,041 --> 01:07:53,373
You told me about your mom and
sister from your previous birth..

713
01:07:53,444 --> 01:07:54,706
What about them?

714
01:07:55,045 --> 01:07:57,309
l'll try my best to search
for them tomorrow morning.

715
01:07:58,048 --> 01:08:00,915
This catering college was
built by the Verma family.

716
01:08:01,218 --> 01:08:03,914
But unfortunately they are
nowhere to be found today.

717
01:08:04,354 --> 01:08:07,448
What happened to Ravi Verma's
mom and sister after his death?

718
01:08:08,325 --> 01:08:15,458
''As far as l know, his mom fell
totally silent after that shock.''

719
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:21,861
''And his sister.. yes, Jyoti! She's
studying in this college itself!''

720
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:26,368
She's a very nice girl.
My daughters are nice too.

721
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:31,069
''The three of them. Masti,
Muskaan and Muskurahat.''

722
01:08:31,748 --> 01:08:34,876
l feel like crying the
moment l remember them.

723
01:08:35,319 --> 01:08:38,379
l'm worried about their marriage.

724
01:08:39,122 --> 01:08:41,989
Are you married?
- No.

725
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:47,153
Come home in the evening.
My daughters cook really well..

726
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,028
They are your fans too!

727
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,428
l was asking about Ravi
Verma's mom and sister.

728
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:57,167
''Oh! Sorry, l forgot about that.
You know such things happen.''

729
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:03,174
''Sorry, sorry. - As far as l know,
they have left this city.''

730
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:09,785
And the only one who can tell
you about them is Mrs. Kamini.

731
01:09:58,502 --> 01:10:00,163
''
Princess, l've never seen you lose.''

732
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:01,363
Better luck next time.

733
01:10:07,311 --> 01:10:08,539
Place your bets please.

734
01:10:08,845 --> 01:10:09,903
Place your bets.

735
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:13,911
You shouldn't bet more. You'll lose.

736
01:10:17,854 --> 01:10:19,048
Oh! Good evening.

737
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:24,325
What do you mean?
- There's a proverb..

738
01:10:24,528 --> 01:10:27,053
''
Unlucky in love, lucky in gambling.''

739
01:10:28,231 --> 01:10:33,134
''And the reverse of that is lucky
in love, unlucky in gambling.''

740
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:44,512
''Kamini, l can't believe
you lost the bet.''

741
01:10:45,215 --> 01:10:46,273
''
lt's ok, darling.''

742
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:51,285
You shouldn't bet. You'll lose.

743
01:10:51,555 --> 01:10:54,422
''Mr. Astrologer, mind your
own business please.''

744
01:10:55,592 --> 01:10:58,083
l told you there's an old proverb..

745
01:10:58,261 --> 01:10:59,888
''
Unlucky in love, lucky in gambling.''

746
01:10:59,963 --> 01:11:03,023
''And the reverse of that is lucky
in love, unlucky in gambling.''

747
01:11:04,935 --> 01:11:07,927
You lost because you've found love.

748
01:11:09,973 --> 01:11:11,065
What were you thinking?

749
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:18,140
''
Princess, you've lost again.''

750
01:11:21,585 --> 01:11:23,985
lt seems like you've found
love again.

751
01:11:46,276 --> 01:11:47,573
''
'What are you thinking, Kamini?'''

752
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:53,343
'What made you think about
Ravi Verma after so long?'

753
01:11:55,285 --> 01:11:58,254
''
That guy, Monty, is just like him.''

754
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:03,157
''When l see him, l feel like
it's Ravi l'm looking at.''

755
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:11,167
Excuse me! - lnsolent man!
Couldn't you knock on the door?

756
01:12:11,334 --> 01:12:13,598
''Sorry, madam, you had forgotten
your mobile there.''

757
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:16,696
Keep it there! And get out
of the room! Now!

758
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:20,699
''Yes, ma'am.
- Get out! - Yes, ma'am.''

759
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:30,611
''Monty, what are you thinking about?
- Nothing.''

760
01:12:31,588 --> 01:12:33,988
''You know, l'm going to
Durban for three days..''

761
01:12:34,057 --> 01:12:35,524
..for a catering assignment.

762
01:12:35,659 --> 01:12:38,025
l thought we would spend
the whole day together..

763
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:40,095
Have a good time and go
to a casino at night.

764
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:43,131
''And you're being so quiet?
Tell me, what is it?''

765
01:12:44,601 --> 01:12:47,001
A friend of mine called from
Cape Town last night.

766
01:12:47,204 --> 01:12:49,263
She's got a problem..
- What kind of a problem?

767
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:56,308
''
Long ago, l knew a couple..''

768
01:12:56,713 --> 01:12:59,181
But they parted ways due
to some misunderstanding.

769
01:13:00,016 --> 01:13:03,213
lt took him a long time to
get over his lost love.

770
01:13:04,187 --> 01:13:06,052
Then another girl came
into his life.

771
01:13:06,690 --> 01:13:09,557
He loved her and promised marriage.

772
01:13:11,128 --> 01:13:13,756
''Then all of a sudden, his
ex came back into his life.''

773
01:13:14,698 --> 01:13:16,222
''Then all of a sudden, his
ex came back into his life.''

774
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:20,032
What should he do now?
He can't forget his ex..

775
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:24,164
..and at the same time he
cannot ditch that girl.

776
01:13:25,075 --> 01:13:28,067
He should tell that
new girl everything.

777
01:13:28,411 --> 01:13:32,575
''lf she loves him, she'll allow
him to go to his ex.''

778
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:35,376
''lf l would have been her,
l would have done that.''

779
01:13:37,554 --> 01:13:39,249
Thanks.
- For?

780
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:42,058
You solved the problem so easily.

781
01:13:42,125 --> 01:13:45,185
''You're talking as if it's your
problem, not your friend's!''

782
01:13:45,395 --> 01:13:48,455
''Hey, you don't intend
to ditch me? ls it?''

783
01:13:51,268 --> 01:13:54,362
l know you would never ditch me.

l told you to not gamble.

824
01:19:13,214 --> 01:19:14,841
The moment you placed a bet on
the number two horse..

825
01:19:14,915 --> 01:19:18,043
''..l placed a bet on the second
favourite, number one horse.''

826
01:19:19,954 --> 01:19:21,581
This is your winning ticket.

827
01:19:25,926 --> 01:19:29,589
Oh my God! Wow!

828
01:19:31,098 --> 01:19:32,429
You're quite amazing!

829

''lf l was really amazing, will you
have lunch with me tomorrow?''

831

pick up line than this!

832
01:19:46,747 --> 01:19:49,443
''
Alright, we'll have lunch tomorrow.''

833
01:19:49,583 --> 01:19:50,675
Done!

834
01:19:56,590 --> 01:20:00,856
''Enough! Enough, Monty!
l'll die laughing!''

835
01:20:00,928 --> 01:20:01,986
''
Oh, come on!''

836
01:20:02,162 --> 01:20:05,029
We've met after so long.
l won't let you go so easily.

837
01:20:11,939 --> 01:20:14,032
''
Come on, let's get out of here.''

838
01:20:15,943 --> 01:20:19,709
''Monty, this was the
best day of my life.''

839
01:20:19,847 --> 01:20:20,905
You're lying.

840
01:20:21,749 --> 01:20:24,445
lf this has been the most beautiful
day of your life..

841
01:20:24,518 --> 01:20:27,851
''..then you would have said,
'We should meet more often.'''

842
01:20:29,490 --> 01:20:32,084
You're quite aggressive.
l like it.

843
01:20:32,459 --> 01:20:33,517
Come on.

844
01:20:42,102 --> 01:20:44,536
''Good afternoon, Princess.
- Hello, Kabira.''

845
01:20:44,805 --> 01:20:47,672
How are you?
- l was alright sometime back.

846
01:20:47,975 --> 01:20:50,466
But today l feel a little low.

847
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:54,947
''Take care of yourself, Kabira.
- Thank you.''

848
01:20:55,983 --> 01:20:57,644
''Bye, Monty.
- Bye.''

849
01:21:05,693 --> 01:21:07,490
Seems like you two have
become good friends..

850
01:21:07,561 --> 01:21:08,755
..in just a couple of days.

851
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:14,900
''Yesterday a casino, today a
racecourse and then lunch.''

852
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:19,162
''Make sure you guys don't reach
the dinner table, my friend.''

853
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:20,831
''
What are you saying, uncle Kabir?''

854
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:23,169
Our meeting yesterday
was just a coincidence.

855
01:21:23,877 --> 01:21:27,973
l am talking about what l saw.

856
01:21:28,716 --> 01:21:29,808
l'll take your leave.

857
01:21:32,119 --> 01:21:37,523
'''Do not lie, my friend, tell the
truth, do not hurt me, my friend.'''

858
01:21:37,591 --> 01:21:39,957
''Film: Aap Ka Saroor.
- 2007. - Hero, Himesh Reshammiya.''

859
01:21:40,027 --> 01:21:41,085
Super-hit!

860
01:21:52,106 --> 01:21:53,835
''Ma'am, someone's left behind
a bouquet for you.''

861
01:21:57,544 --> 01:21:59,034
Beautiful flowers.

862
01:22:05,586 --> 01:22:06,712
Ok.

863
01:22:09,857 --> 01:22:12,087
'l know you will refuse
me after reading this.'

864
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:15,590
'But l also know you'll
surely come to meet me.'

865
01:22:15,963 --> 01:22:19,592
'l'll be waiting at Tandoori
Nights club at 9 p.m.'

866

''
'Love you, Monty.'''

867
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:54,628
Hello.

868
01:23:00,174 --> 01:23:03,371
One could learn how to get angry
with you despite your love.

869
01:23:04,211 --> 01:23:05,337
You're half an hour late.

870
01:23:07,214 --> 01:23:08,340
Sorry.

871
01:23:17,191 --> 01:23:18,249

''lf this is the way you apologise,
l don't mind it if you're late.''

873
01:23:33,407 --> 01:23:34,499
This is for you.

874
01:23:36,243 --> 01:23:39,679
What's this?
- Open it. Ok.

875
01:23:50,924 --> 01:23:55,384
''
Oh my God! lt's beautiful, Ravi.''

876
01:23:55,662 --> 01:23:59,154
There was no need to buy me
such an expensive gift..

877
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:01,060
..without any occasion.

878
01:24:01,969 --> 01:24:08,374
There couldn't be a better
occasion than our wedding.

879

''
''''l'll lose myself..''''''

Hey, what happened?''

882
01:24:27,361 --> 01:24:28,419
You didn't like it?

''My husband, Ravi Verma, had written
the song you just sang.''

955
01:31:33,954 --> 01:31:37,890
How could you sing it?
- lt just came out from within.

956
01:31:38,925 --> 01:31:41,689
What do you want?! What do you want?!

957
01:31:41,761 --> 01:31:43,126
''
l love you, Kamini.''

958
01:31:43,897 --> 01:31:48,129
Are you nuts? There's a huge
age difference between us.

959
01:31:48,735 --> 01:31:53,138
''
For me, you're very beautiful.''

960
01:31:55,475 --> 01:31:56,601
Age and other hazards
of relationships..

961
01:31:56,676 --> 01:31:58,143
..can't stop me from loving you.

962
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:04,473
The love that could even defy death..

963
01:32:05,986 --> 01:32:07,817
''
Kamini, l'm Ravi Verma.''

964
01:32:10,824 --> 01:32:12,052
Your Ravi Verma.

965
01:32:13,927 --> 01:32:18,159
l had a rebirth because of my
extreme love and your patience.

966
01:32:22,502 --> 01:32:27,496
That's nonsense! l don't believe
in rebirths! You're a liar!

967
01:32:28,708 --> 01:32:30,505
''
What proof do you want, Kamini?!''

968
01:32:31,011 --> 01:32:32,842
You have bed tea before
brushing in the morning.

969
01:32:32,912 --> 01:32:35,881
You get acidity if you don't get
your breakfast before 10am.

970
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:37,883
You hate those who drink coffee.

971
01:32:37,951 --> 01:32:40,681
You can't tolerate cigarettes
and smokers.

972
01:32:40,754 --> 01:32:44,087
''Come on, Monty! Anybody can
find these things out.''

973
01:32:45,058 --> 01:32:47,458
''Okay, l'll tell you something
that only you..''

974
01:32:47,527 --> 01:32:49,859
''
..or your husband, Ravi Verma, knew.''

975
01:32:50,630 --> 01:32:53,190
You close your eyes while kissing.

976
01:32:54,801 --> 01:32:55,927
On your wedding night..

977
01:33:28,101 --> 01:33:30,661
Would you still say that
l'm not Ravi Verma?

978
01:33:36,042 --> 01:33:42,038
No. Only Ravi Verma can
know these things.

979
01:33:46,686 --> 01:33:48,677
''You don't know how much
l love you, Kamini.''

980
01:33:51,091 --> 01:33:54,686
l remember each and every
moment spent with you.

981
01:33:56,796 --> 01:33:58,661
l remember all our conversations.

982
01:34:02,869 --> 01:34:05,667
The only thing l cannot
recollect is my accident.

983
01:34:08,108 --> 01:34:12,272
l just remember that we were
travelling in the plane together.

984
01:34:14,047 --> 01:34:18,108
Then l remember that the plane
was rushing towards land..

985
01:34:22,155 --> 01:34:24,953
And then the plane
crashed and l died..

986
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,868
Can you tell me how
this accident took place?

987
01:34:46,146 --> 01:34:48,637
''
Tell me, Kamini. Tell me.''

988
01:34:53,186 --> 01:34:57,987
l shudder when l think of that day.

989
01:34:58,925 --> 01:35:03,055
''We were on our way
to meet your, mother.''

990
01:35:03,797 --> 01:35:06,789
Suddenly there was some
problem with the plane.

991
01:35:10,670 --> 01:35:12,297
You told me to wear my parachute.

992
01:35:12,672 --> 01:35:14,071
l had already worn my parachute.

993
01:35:15,008 --> 01:35:16,669
And then you asked me to jump!

994
01:35:17,877 --> 01:35:20,607
When l asked about your parachute..

995
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:23,843
..you told me that the
plane had just one.

996
01:35:23,917 --> 01:35:25,077
There's one more parachute
behind my seat.

997
01:35:25,151 --> 01:35:26,277
Hand it to me quickly.

998
01:35:26,953 --> 01:35:28,853
l refused to jump.

999
01:35:29,189 --> 01:35:30,349
''
l'll miss you, my love.''

1000
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:35,686
You pushed me out of
the plane by force..

1001
01:35:35,762 --> 01:35:36,820
Kamini!

1002
01:35:39,799 --> 01:35:44,827
And l saw you dying before me..

1003
01:35:45,972 --> 01:35:53,140
l couldn't do anything!
l couldn't do anything!

1004
01:35:54,814 --> 01:35:59,911
''Calm down, Kamini.
l'm here because of your love.''

1005
01:36:02,222 --> 01:36:06,352
Where is my mom and sister?

1006
01:36:09,996 --> 01:36:16,128
Your mom stopped talking
out of shock.

1007
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:20,671
Doctors advised to take
her away from this place..

1008
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:24,733
..so that she could overcome
the shock of your death.

1009
01:36:26,012 --> 01:36:27,980
l sent mother and Jyoti to lndia.

1010
01:36:29,015 --> 01:36:33,247
But mother died in a few days.

1011
01:36:35,088 --> 01:36:36,385
Jyoti got married.

1012
01:36:38,024 --> 01:36:44,429
But she and her husband died in
a car accident within a few days.

1013
01:37:02,282 --> 01:37:03,772
What was the need to come home?

1014
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:05,779
You could have spent the
night at the palace.

1015
01:37:08,121 --> 01:37:12,922
''Uncle Kabir, Tina, l'll explain
everything at the right time.''

1016
01:37:12,992 --> 01:37:14,050
What will you explain?

1017
01:37:14,794 --> 01:37:19,458
That you love a woman
twice your age?

1018
01:37:20,266 --> 01:37:22,860
Didn't you think of Tina even once?

1019
01:37:23,770 --> 01:37:27,570
''l've come across many silly people,
but none like you.''

1020
01:37:28,408 --> 01:37:32,071
You'd be stunned if l tell you
the truth about that lady..

1021
01:37:32,579 --> 01:37:35,571
..for whom you broke up with Tina.

1022
01:37:36,683 --> 01:37:38,082
What do you know about Princess?

1023
01:37:38,585 --> 01:37:40,246
She's a witch. Not some princess!

1024
01:37:42,855 --> 01:37:47,019
She destroyed the Verma family.

1025
01:37:47,594 --> 01:37:51,086
She was Ravi Verma's
wife and now she's..

1026
01:37:51,598 --> 01:37:55,193
..a concubine of an international
criminal named Sir Juda.

1027
01:37:55,868 --> 01:37:57,733
''
How do you know this, uncle Kabir?''

1028
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:06,941
l haven't even told Tina what
l'm going to tell you today.

1029
01:38:09,749 --> 01:38:14,982
''Tina's father, Mahesh, worked
as a driver at Kamini's house.''

1030
01:38:16,122 --> 01:38:17,612
He was a very good friend of mine.

1031
01:38:18,324 --> 01:38:22,522
There was a loud bang
on my door one night..

1032
01:38:22,595 --> 01:38:28,693
Kabira! Kabira! Kabira!
- Mahesh!

1033
01:38:29,202 --> 01:38:31,864
What happened? Who did this?

1034
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:33,936
''
l'm going to die, Kabira.''

1035
01:38:35,642 --> 01:38:37,303
Take care of my daughter.

1036
01:38:38,211 --> 01:38:40,304
Tell me who shot you?!

1037
01:38:41,614 --> 01:38:43,548
l had been to Kamini's house..
- Yes.

1038
01:38:45,184 --> 01:38:49,314
l overheard their conversation.
Mac saw me..

1039
01:38:49,789 --> 01:38:51,654
He was the one who shot me..

1040
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:55,753
What were they talking about?
Tell me.

1041
01:38:56,929 --> 01:38:59,659
Goddess Kali's temple..
- Goddess Kali's temple?!

1042
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:03,330
Than - Ravi Verma..

1043
01:39:07,140 --> 01:39:09,108
Mahesh?!

1044
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:14,337
l didn't inform the police as
l was worried about Tina.

1045
01:39:15,515 --> 01:39:19,178
l didn't have much work then..

1046
01:39:19,252 --> 01:39:22,244
..so l went to Sir Juda and
Kamini's house the next day.

1047
01:39:22,321 --> 01:39:28,692
Oh! So Mahesh told you everything
before his death.

1048
01:39:29,195 --> 01:39:35,100
Yes. At Goddess Kali's temple..
- Enough! No need to go further.

1049
01:39:36,703 --> 01:39:39,797
How much money do you want?
- We don't deal in such things.

1050
01:39:40,973 --> 01:39:43,134
''Because of you, an innocent
girl became an orphan.''

1051
01:39:44,844 --> 01:39:47,711
You'll bring her up like
her mother would.

1052
01:39:48,281 --> 01:39:51,216
''And yes, if something
happens to us..''

1053
01:39:51,718 --> 01:39:54,186
..this secret will be
revealed to the police.

1054
01:39:54,987 --> 01:39:57,114
l've made sure this happens.

1055
01:39:59,826 --> 01:40:04,229
We brokered this deal but l
still think about the link..

1056
01:40:04,297 --> 01:40:09,291
..between Ravi Verma's death
and Goddess Kali's temple.

1057
01:40:09,802 --> 01:40:13,795
l'll tell you about it!

1058
01:40:15,908 --> 01:40:17,671
''You?
- Yes, Kabira!''

1059
01:40:18,177 --> 01:40:21,908
l'm the truth that the world refuses
to believe! That's me!

1060
01:40:22,315 --> 01:40:25,250
Think about it. A guy loves
a girl a lot and..

1061
01:40:25,752 --> 01:40:29,119
..goes against his religion and
traditions and marries her.

1062
01:40:29,322 --> 01:40:32,257
But the girl kills him just
two days into the marriage.

1063
01:40:32,759 --> 01:40:34,158
Only for money!

1064
01:40:34,327 --> 01:40:36,318
But look at nature's benevolence!

1065
01:40:36,662 --> 01:40:38,254
The lover has a rebirth!

1066
01:40:38,331 --> 01:40:40,265
''And in his youth, finds out that
the same girl is living..''

1067
01:40:40,767 --> 01:40:43,429
..comfortably as some princess!

1068
01:40:44,871 --> 01:40:47,271
The temple made by Ravi
Verma still exists.

1069
01:40:47,774 --> 01:40:50,971
The college funded by
Ravi Verma exists.

1070
01:40:52,044 --> 01:40:54,308
But where's the Verma family?!

1071
01:40:55,348 --> 01:40:58,044
Where are my mother and sister?!

1072
01:40:59,285 --> 01:41:02,311
Nobody knows anything! Nobody!

1073
01:41:03,222 --> 01:41:07,056
''What are you talking about?
- The truth, uncle Kabir!''

1074
01:41:08,161 --> 01:41:09,719
This miracle has happened to me.

1075
01:41:11,230 --> 01:41:12,788
This happened to me!

1076
01:41:13,132 --> 01:41:16,727
l'm not insane to talk this
way. This is the truth.

1077
01:41:17,236 --> 01:41:20,296
''So, you are that very
same Ravi Verma..''

1078
01:41:23,342 --> 01:41:27,301
Oh God! What kind of
a miracle is this?!

1079
01:41:28,648 --> 01:41:32,311
''
Monty, l believe you wholeheartedly..''

1080
01:41:32,819 --> 01:41:37,222
..even if nobody else does.

1081
01:41:40,092 --> 01:41:43,084
God knows where that lady must
have kept your mom and sister.

1082
01:41:47,066 --> 01:41:48,966
That's the reason l acted
as if l loved her.

1083
01:41:52,205 --> 01:41:53,536
l've even made her believe that..

1084
01:41:53,606 --> 01:41:55,972
..l'm her late husband Ravi Verma.

1085
01:41:56,943 --> 01:42:00,106
l told her that l don't
remember how l had died.

1086
01:42:01,113 --> 01:42:03,946
l did this to know about
my mom and sister.

1087
01:42:04,884 --> 01:42:09,617
And she told me that my mom and
sister are dead! A lie! A lie!

1088
01:42:10,623 --> 01:42:12,682
l have a feeling that
they both are alive.

1089
01:42:12,758 --> 01:42:15,090
l'm sure they are alive.

1090
01:42:15,895 --> 01:42:23,131
''Don't worry, God will certainly
take you to your mom and sister.''

1091
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:28,634
You aren't alone.
We all will help you find them.

1092
01:42:29,575 --> 01:42:30,701
''
Let's go, Tina.''

1093
01:42:33,913 --> 01:42:36,746
''l'm sorry, Monty,
l misunderstood you.''

1094
01:42:37,216 --> 01:42:38,274
''
lts okay, Tina.''

1095
01:42:57,169 --> 01:43:03,733
Ravi Verma would be the only
name left after Shantaprasad.

1096
01:43:05,344 --> 01:43:07,403
He'll repay what the
Verma family owes.

1097
01:43:09,081 --> 01:43:11,811
He'll make them respectable
once again.

1098
01:43:35,007 --> 01:43:37,202
''
Brother, you broke the guitar again?''

1099
01:43:37,443 --> 01:43:39,843
You haven't learnt guitar
even though you're..

1100
01:43:40,112 --> 01:43:42,103
..the elder brother
of a guitar champion!

1101
01:43:42,949 --> 01:43:48,114
''Sister, your brother always
does what he intends to do.''

1102
01:43:49,121 --> 01:43:56,027
Forget it! You'll have to have
a rebirth to learn guitar! - You!

1103
01:44:23,155 --> 01:44:26,090
Kabira is at your behest
and requests..

1104
01:44:27,093 --> 01:44:31,029
''..you oh God, unite the one's
who have parted ways.''

1105
01:44:32,631 --> 01:44:36,192
''
Unite them, oh God.''

1106
01:44:51,217 --> 01:44:54,448
''Martha. - Martha's not come
today, sir. l'm her replacement.''

1107
01:44:54,787 --> 01:44:56,311
Get me a glass of water.

1108
01:45:03,062 --> 01:45:04,120
''
Tea is ready, sir.''

1109
01:45:04,296 --> 01:45:06,093
Just get me ajug of water!

1110
01:45:06,932 --> 01:45:09,799
''Sir, one should not drink
alcohol in the morning..''

1111
01:45:09,869 --> 01:45:11,427
Shut up and get me water..

1112
01:45:12,071 --> 01:45:15,234
Elders say alcohol ruins families.

1113
01:45:25,751 --> 01:45:27,742
What's your name?
- Laxmi.

1114
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:33,485
Martha stays near my place.
l came here as she wasn't well.

1115
01:45:33,826 --> 01:45:38,126
''
Laxmi? No, your name can't be Laxmi.''

1116
01:45:38,197 --> 01:45:42,224
You aren't Laxmi.
- l'm Laxmi. - You can't be Laxmi!

1117
01:45:42,301 --> 01:45:43,768
You're Jyoyti! Jyoti!

1118
01:45:45,304 --> 01:45:49,035
My name is Laxmi not Jyoti!
l'm Laxmi!

1119
01:45:49,108 --> 01:45:52,305
You're lying! You're Jyoti!
- No!

1120
01:45:53,846 --> 01:45:55,837
''Please don't address me
that way, sir.''

1121
01:45:55,915 --> 01:45:57,780
Then why don't you tell
me that you are..

1122
01:45:57,850 --> 01:45:58,908
..Shantaprasad Verma's daughter!

1123
01:45:58,984 --> 01:46:01,851
Shantaprasad's dead! So
is the Verma family!

1124
01:46:02,421 --> 01:46:04,048
l'm not related to them.

1125
01:46:05,458 --> 01:46:12,261
l'm poor and l work
to support my kids.

1126
01:46:13,332 --> 01:46:15,300
How are you even related to me?!

1127
01:46:16,368 --> 01:46:21,863
Don't hurt me by thinking that
l'm a part of the Verma family.

1128
01:46:23,008 --> 01:46:24,066
Pinky..

1129
01:46:30,049 --> 01:46:32,142
''Pinky?
- Yes, Pinky.''

1130
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:36,950
''You didn't, but l recognised
you, my sister.''

1131
01:46:37,022 --> 01:46:39,513
Sister? You called me sister?

1132
01:46:39,892 --> 01:46:43,885
''Yes, Pinky. You're Ravi
Verma's sister, isn't it?''

1133
01:46:44,330 --> 01:46:47,163
He used to call you Pinky lovingly.
- Ravi Verma?

1134
01:46:48,167 --> 01:46:50,533
How do you know him?
- Because l am..

1135
01:46:52,171 --> 01:46:53,832
''
l mean, l'm Ravi Verma's friend.''

1136
01:46:54,907 --> 01:46:58,399
''No, l mean, my father used to be
a friend of his at Cape Town.''

1137
01:46:59,178 --> 01:47:01,908
Cape Town? Brother used
to go there frequently.

1138
01:47:02,181 --> 01:47:04,342
l have your family photograph
in my house.

1139
01:47:05,484 --> 01:47:07,145
Father told me to enquire
about the Verma family..

1140
01:47:07,219 --> 01:47:09,551
..whenever l visit Cape Town.

1141
01:47:10,723 --> 01:47:13,521
''He too tried his best to search
you all, but couldn't succeed.''

1142
01:47:14,493 --> 01:47:16,222
''
We don't exist now, sir.''

1143
01:47:17,496 --> 01:47:21,227
We faced a lot of hardships
after brother's death.

1144
01:47:22,234 --> 01:47:25,567
We are two dead bodies.
Me and my mother.

1145
01:47:26,672 --> 01:47:28,299
Mom? Where's she? How's she?

1146
01:47:28,574 --> 01:47:30,303
''Please, take me to her.
l want to meet her now!''

1147
01:47:30,509 --> 01:47:37,415
''lt's no use, sir.
She's in a sorry state.''

1148
01:47:38,717 --> 01:47:44,417
Brother died years ago but she

1149

''
'Hey, return my pencil to me!'''

1150
01:47:49,862 --> 01:47:51,921
'l didn't take your pencil!'
- 'Don't lie!'

1151
01:47:52,131 --> 01:47:53,257
'You took my new pencil!'

1152
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:57,064
''Granny, Raju isn't returning
my pencil to me!''

1153
01:47:58,137 --> 01:48:00,537
Don't tell her she
can't hear or talk.

1154
01:48:10,416 --> 01:48:14,216
She keeps gazing at brother's
photograph everyday.

1155
01:48:14,887 --> 01:48:16,878
She never sleeps.

1156
01:48:58,030 --> 01:48:59,088
''
You've come, son..''

1157
01:49:06,138 --> 01:49:09,596
''Mom.
- Mummy.. - Mummy, Raju doesn't..''

1158
01:49:12,611 --> 01:49:14,101
Yes.

1159
01:49:15,614 --> 01:49:19,243
''You must be very tired,
isn't it dear?''

1160
01:49:20,986 --> 01:49:23,284
''
Pinky, look. Ravi's come!''

1161
01:49:26,058 --> 01:49:31,291
l knew you would be late
but you would surely come.

1162
01:49:37,102 --> 01:49:40,629
Tell me. Why don't you talk?

1163
01:49:44,910 --> 01:49:46,275
''
You're my Ravi, isn't it?''

1164
01:49:49,915 --> 01:49:54,648
''
Yes. Yes, you're my Ravi.''

1165
01:49:56,655 --> 01:49:58,316
My dear son!

1166
01:49:59,158 --> 01:50:03,822
''Mother, have a seat.
He's not your Ravi.''

1167
01:50:03,896 --> 01:50:07,593
''No..
- Mom, you aren't feeling well. Come.''

1168
01:50:07,666 --> 01:50:09,657
No! He's my son Ravi!

1169
01:50:09,735 --> 01:50:11,669
He's my son Ravi!

1170
01:50:12,171 --> 01:50:16,073
God can deceive everybody
but not a mother.

1171
01:50:16,141 --> 01:50:19,736
''He's my son. - He's not your son,
mom. He's someone else!''

1172
01:50:19,812 --> 01:50:22,007
No.. he's my son Ravi.

1173
01:50:22,081 --> 01:50:28,020
Please leave her alone. - But..
- l told you all to let her be.

1174
01:50:38,464 --> 01:50:39,522
Mother!

1175
01:50:40,032 --> 01:50:41,659
''Mom..
- You're my Ravi, aren't you?''

1176
01:50:42,601 --> 01:50:44,865
''
Yes, mom. l'm your son Ravi.''

1177
01:50:47,606 --> 01:50:49,904
''
Nobody recognised me, but you did.''

1178
01:50:51,877 --> 01:50:55,938
My son recognised me!

1179
01:50:58,050 --> 01:50:59,745
He recognised his mother!

1180
01:51:00,753 --> 01:51:05,019
''Mom, you'll have to
listen to me now..''

1181
01:51:06,158 --> 01:51:10,686
''Yes. - Take rest now.
- Yes, now l'll rest.''

1182
01:51:12,631 --> 01:51:16,692
l'll sleep peacefully
now that you're here.

1183
01:51:18,103 --> 01:51:19,161
Come.

1184
01:51:23,642 --> 01:51:30,070
''Now that you've come,
l'll sleep peacefully.''

1185
01:51:45,364 --> 01:51:47,525
''
Mom, who's he?''

1186
01:51:49,802 --> 01:51:54,501
''
Come here, dear. l'm your uncle.''

1187
01:51:56,642 --> 01:51:59,440
''Henceforth, you all
will stay with me.''

1188
01:52:01,880 --> 01:52:07,876
''Great. Oh God, you hurt
and you heal too.''

1189
01:52:09,655 --> 01:52:12,920
''
Dear, he's your brother Ravi.''

1190
01:52:13,826 --> 01:52:15,794
A miracle of God.

1191
01:52:16,862 --> 01:52:24,792
''Monty, you carry out your work.
l'll look after them.''

1192
01:52:30,342 --> 01:52:34,073
Sir Juda made me an offer
after your death.

1193
01:52:35,247 --> 01:52:37,181
lf l do not claim the property..

1194
01:52:37,416 --> 01:52:40,715
..he will pay me 5 lakhs
every month.

1195
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:45,515
Only you knew about
the property papers.

1196
01:52:46,892 --> 01:52:50,851
Mother wasn't well and l had
to send her to lndia too..

1197
01:52:52,431 --> 01:52:54,899
Therefore l accepted
Sir Juda's offer.

1198
01:52:58,837 --> 01:53:03,433
People even passed comments
that l am Sir Juda's keep.

1199
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:09,745
But l tolerated everything for
mother and Jyoti's sake.

1200
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:19,885
''Kamini, you've sacrificed
a lot for my family,''

1201
01:53:22,461 --> 01:53:24,793
''And now, Sir Juda will
have to pay for it.''

1202
01:53:26,732 --> 01:53:29,633
''Come, l'll tell you where
the property papers are.''

1203
01:53:31,737 --> 01:53:33,967
''But Monty, there's a wall here!
- Just come with me.''

1204
01:53:36,742 --> 01:53:37,936
Oh my God!

1205
01:53:56,261 --> 01:53:57,421
Here are the property papers.

1206
01:53:58,030 --> 01:54:01,898
File them in court on my behalf.

1207
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:03,991
Court?!
- Why?!

1208
01:54:04,736 --> 01:54:06,829
''l want to fulfill my mother's
dream, Kamini.''

1209
01:54:06,939 --> 01:54:09,999
Sir Juda's a dangerous man.
He can do anything!

1210
01:54:10,075 --> 01:54:13,374
''He can't. Tell me, are
you with me on this?''

1211
01:54:14,279 --> 01:54:17,271
Yes. l love you.

1212
01:54:20,052 --> 01:54:23,021
''l love you too, Kamini.
l love you too.''

1213
01:54:25,991 --> 01:54:27,720
What nonsense are you talking
about?! Rebirths!

1214
01:54:28,060 --> 01:54:29,118
''
lt's true, sir.''

1215
01:54:29,795 --> 01:54:33,253
l've seen him taking out the
property papers from the safe.

1216
01:54:33,332 --> 01:54:36,130
She's about to file a
court case against you.

1217
01:54:42,808 --> 01:54:45,470
Sir Juda says you should keep a
close eye on Kamini from now on.

1218
01:54:45,744 --> 01:54:46,802
Okay.

1219
01:54:46,878 --> 01:54:49,472
''lf what you say turns out to
be true, you'll be rich soon.''

1220
01:54:50,349 --> 01:54:51,976
''
Thank you, Sir Juda.''

1221
01:55:03,929 --> 01:55:04,987
''
You're right, Sir Juda.''

1222
01:55:05,497 --> 01:55:08,057
Kamini has revolted against
us on Monty's insistence.

1223
01:55:08,767 --> 01:55:11,167
''lf Monty dies, so will
Kamini's resilience.''

1224
01:55:20,045 --> 01:55:22,912
''May l come in, Princess?
- Yes, Tina.''

1225
01:55:24,783 --> 01:55:27,946
''l want to talk to you about
something, Princess. - Yes.''

1226
01:55:29,521 --> 01:55:31,182
Monty has told me everything.

1227
01:55:32,524 --> 01:55:36,187
lt seems he's made just for you.

1228
01:55:38,630 --> 01:55:42,293
l cannot interfere with a person
who's just come back..

1229
01:55:42,534 --> 01:55:45,970
..from the brink of death.

1230
01:55:48,540 --> 01:55:52,533
l won't mind it if you marry Monty.

1231
01:55:53,812 --> 01:55:59,717
''Tina, you've relieved
me from my troubles!''

1232
01:56:00,552 --> 01:56:03,646
l'll never forget this act of yours.

1233
01:56:09,094 --> 01:56:11,688
''Tina - Now you don't have a reason
not to marry, right?''

1234
01:56:14,733 --> 01:56:15,791
No.

1235
01:56:16,535 --> 01:56:19,595
lt's Ravi's death anniversary
in three days.

1236
01:56:20,806 --> 01:56:22,273
We will get married after that.

1237
01:56:22,607 --> 01:56:23,801
Ravi Verma is in front of you and..

1238
01:56:23,875 --> 01:56:25,274
..you're talking about
his death anniversary!

1239
01:56:25,877 --> 01:56:28,607
''Kamini, we will get married
that very day.''

1240
01:56:29,614 --> 01:56:31,548
l have a show after three days and..

1241
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:33,277
..l want to announce it
before the audience!

1242
01:56:35,721 --> 01:56:38,281
l'll tell the whole word about
our love story during the show.

1243
01:56:39,124 --> 01:56:41,615
l'll tell them how true love comes
to life even after death!

1244
01:56:54,673 --> 01:56:56,072
According to Sir Juda's plan..

1245
01:56:56,141 --> 01:56:58,735
..we will give you a
guitar after an hour.

1246
01:56:59,144 --> 01:57:01,135
You have to replace it
with Monty's guitar.

1247
01:57:02,147 --> 01:57:04,138
''l'll do it, but what
would that achieve?''

1248
01:57:07,285 --> 01:57:10,083
''Sir Juda says, upon touching
the strings of that guitar..''

1249
01:57:10,155 --> 01:57:12,146
..Monty will return to his world.

1250
01:57:18,430 --> 01:57:19,488
Ladies and gentlemen!

1251
01:57:20,432 --> 01:57:22,093
''
Today, l want you all to witness..''

1252
01:57:22,167 --> 01:57:24,158

moment of my life.

1253
01:57:25,670 --> 01:57:26,762
l'm getting married!

1254
01:57:30,175 --> 01:57:34,509
''Today, this very place.
At this moment.''

1255
01:57:37,449 --> 01:57:39,849
''
So please welcome, Princess Kamini!''

1256
01:57:49,227 --> 01:57:52,287
You must be wondering
why l am marrying her..

1257
01:57:52,364 --> 01:57:54,491
..when she's elder to me.

1258
01:57:56,168 --> 01:57:59,160
There's a story behind it. A secret.

1259
01:57:59,638 --> 01:58:07,443
And l'm going to reveal
it in this show today.

1260
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:10,775

02:06:18,770 --> 02:06:20,499
You've committed a fraud!

1313
02:06:22,674 --> 02:06:26,007
''You've deceived me!
- You had deceived me, Kamini!''

1314
02:06:26,511 --> 02:06:28,911
''
You committed the fraud, you!''

1315
02:06:29,747 --> 02:06:31,339
The daughter-in-law of Shantaprasad..

1316
02:06:31,749 --> 02:06:34,946
..the Princess of this palace
and Sir Juda's keep!

1317
02:06:35,086 --> 02:06:36,576
Take a look at nature's mystery!

1318
02:06:36,721 --> 02:06:39,519
l'm the same Ravi Verma
who loved you.

1319
02:06:40,024 --> 02:06:41,889
''l gave you money, fame,
comfort, everything!''

1320
02:06:42,393 --> 02:06:45,920
But what did you give?! lnfamy!

1321
02:06:47,265 --> 02:06:49,324
But not anymore!

1322
02:06:49,834 --> 02:06:51,961
This house belongs to Ravi
Verma and his old mother.

1323
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:54,062
Who have come to live
here after so long.

1324
02:06:57,475 --> 02:07:00,876
''
Ravi, are we home?''

1325
02:07:01,012 --> 02:07:04,072
This house belongs to
that sister who faced..

1326
02:07:04,148 --> 02:07:06,548
..many hardships to make a living.

1327
02:07:07,051 --> 02:07:08,382
''Today, she's coming to
her brother's place..''

1328
02:07:08,886 --> 02:07:09,944
..to exercise her right!

1329
02:07:15,026 --> 02:07:16,391
''Kamini Devi, this house
also belongs..''

1330
02:07:16,894 --> 02:07:20,352
''..to those two kids, who received
nothing, but sadness.''

1331
02:07:23,568 --> 02:07:26,833
''And this is Surya, Ravi
Verma's loyal servant.''

1332
02:07:29,006 --> 02:07:32,533
The only lie l told you was that
l didn't know how l had died.

1333
02:07:32,977 --> 02:07:35,377
''But you lied that you, my
mom and sister were dead!''

1334
02:07:35,446 --> 02:07:37,971
Do you have any evidence that
you didn't kill Ravi Verma?!

1335
02:07:38,049 --> 02:07:39,448
Do you have any evidence that
you didn't kill him?!

1336
02:07:39,717 --> 02:07:41,184
''
Tell me, Kamini! Tell me! Tell me!''

1337
02:07:41,252 --> 02:07:42,913
''
Tell me, did you kill him or not?!''

1338
02:07:43,187 --> 02:07:44,381
''
Tell me, Kamini! Tell me!''

1339
02:07:44,722 --> 02:07:47,190
''Yes, l killed him! l killed
him! l killed him!''

1340
02:07:47,258 --> 02:07:48,919

1341
02:07:49,427 --> 02:07:52,487
l killed him! He can't come back!

1342
02:07:52,997 --> 02:07:54,521
l've killed him!

1343
02:08:01,606 --> 02:08:06,942
''Officer, did you record her
confession? - Yes, sir.''

1344
02:08:07,645 --> 02:08:13,242
'''Had l known you would betray me,
l would never have loved!'''

1345
02:08:13,751 --> 02:08:16,447
''Film, 'Raat ke Andhere Mein.'
- 1969. - Hero, Dev Kumar.''

1346
02:08:16,954 --> 02:08:18,080
Super-flop!

1347
02:08:20,057 --> 02:08:21,115
Uncle Kabir!

1348
02:08:30,902 --> 02:08:34,235
''Sir Juda, it was my mistake
to deceive you.''

1349
02:08:35,239 --> 02:08:39,039
Give me another chance. l have
Ravi Verma's property papers.

1350
02:08:43,314 --> 02:08:45,578
Sir Juda's asking to hand
over Kamini to him.

1351
02:08:46,584 --> 02:08:52,784
''You fool! Those who can't
talk, keep quiet!''

1352
02:08:53,925 --> 02:08:58,055
''l'll sacrifice my daughter,
but never let Kamini go.''

1353
02:08:58,563 --> 02:08:59,621
''
No, uncle Kabir.''

1354
02:09:00,364 --> 02:09:02,594
lt would be foolish to sacrifice
Tina for this lousy woman!

1355
02:09:03,100 --> 02:09:05,159
''Sir Juda, we could hand
over Kamini to you..''

1356
02:09:06,170 --> 02:09:09,731
..if you release Tina.

1357
02:09:14,078 --> 02:09:15,136
We accept.

1358
02:09:16,581 --> 02:09:20,176
Tina will take a step from
there and Kamini from here.

1359
02:09:21,185 --> 02:09:25,212
''And if someone tries to act smart,
bullets will be fired!''

1360
02:09:49,080 --> 02:09:50,206
Rascal!

1361
02:09:50,715 --> 02:09:52,774
Dare you dream of marrying Monty!

1362
02:09:53,784 --> 02:09:55,115
Good day!

1363
02:09:56,587 --> 02:09:57,645
Chaturdas!

1364
02:09:58,656 --> 02:10:01,181
''You joker, you know,
l am the drunkard!''

1365
02:10:12,570 --> 02:10:14,629
''
Mom, carefully. - Come, mom.''

1366
02:10:14,705 --> 02:10:16,297
''
Hurry, mom. Carefully!''

1367
02:10:16,707 --> 02:10:17,833
''
Come, mom.''

1368
02:10:18,342 --> 02:10:21,209
''
You brute, l'll skin you alive!''

02:10:22,213 --> 02:10:23,271
l'll skin you alive!

1370

Monty! Monty!

1371
02:10:32,957 --> 02:10:34,686
''
Monty, Kamini has escaped from here!''

1372
02:10:35,693 --> 02:10:38,218
''Monty, follow her! l'll take
care of the things here!''

1373
02:11:29,914 --> 02:11:30,972
You fool!

1374
02:11:34,619 --> 02:11:35,677
Evil fellow!

1375
02:13:51,021 --> 02:13:53,046
''
C'mon! C'mon, hit me!''

1376
02:13:53,557 --> 02:13:55,525
''
C'mon, hit me! C'mon!''

1377
02:13:56,260 --> 02:13:57,318
''
Hit me, baby! C'mon!''

1378
02:15:09,033 --> 02:15:10,625
Yeah!
