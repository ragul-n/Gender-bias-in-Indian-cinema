00:03:06,756 --> 00:03:11,688
Blast it!

4
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:20,753
I am cutting the crust of the
mountains so that...

5
00:03:21,703 --> 00:03:23,618
you city people don't
die of hunger.

6
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:28,594
This is not the answer to my
question. I am asking you the...

7
00:03:29,053 --> 00:03:31,650
reason behind settling down in
this forest abandoning the city.

8
00:03:31,674 --> 00:03:33,365
Why are you working like a
labour despite being the son...

9
00:03:33,389 --> 00:03:34,836
of a billionaire father?

10
00:03:41,295 --> 00:03:44,643
Look at that way,
you will get the answer.

11
00:03:46,578 --> 00:03:51,222
It may lack all the glamours &
comforts of city life, but you...

12
00:03:51,808 --> 00:03:58,923
will find beauty here too.
The beauty of human courage & labor.

13
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,308
People here are challenging the
fate and trying their part...

14
00:04:04,388 --> 00:04:07,375
so that man become free
forever...

15
00:04:07,888 --> 00:04:09,902
from the jungle of hunger.

16
00:04:12,091 --> 00:04:15,509
And if you consume the salt of
your sweat someday with...

17
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,731
the food, the stomach
doesn't get upset.

18
00:04:20,348 --> 00:04:21,767
Father!

19
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:41,854
- Hello father.
- How are you?

20
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,598
- I am fine.
- How are you Kailash? - Fine.

21
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:50,120
- How is the work going on?
- It's going on well.

22
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:52,696
Why did you come here, father?

23
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:56,906
I have to ask you something,
come with me.

24
00:05:10,982 --> 00:05:14,116
Congratulations on your desolate life.

25
00:05:14,535 --> 00:05:17,062
- But just listen to this!
- Yes, father?

26
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:19,672
- But are you ready for marriage?
- Marriage?

27
00:05:19,752 --> 00:05:21,461
Answer me in one word.

28
00:05:21,711 --> 00:05:24,783
One word is very less.
Please relax a little.

29
00:05:25,062 --> 00:05:28,787
Your mother had chosen this girl
before her death, in your childhood.

30
00:05:29,115 --> 00:05:32,535
But time has changed a lot since then.
World has also moved ahead a lot.

31
00:05:32,615 --> 00:05:34,640
How will I know what
kind of a girl she is.

32
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:37,059
You can have a look at
her picture

33
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:41,831
But I want to see her in person.

34
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,662
If you want you can have a look
at her from distance

35
00:05:43,686 --> 00:05:44,754
From a distance?

36
00:05:44,963 --> 00:05:46,652
But what will I know by seeing
her from distance.

37
00:05:46,676 --> 00:05:48,959
Then will you know her,
after staying together for 20 years?

38
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:53,145
No, actually I want to know how
she walks...

39
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:58,065
& if there is so much fire in
her body so as to cause a blast in me.

40
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:02,118
I want to see if she is the same girl
as she tries to portray herself to be?

41
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:09,937
I stay in this forest. No lady from the
city would like to stay here with me.

42
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:18,849
It is surrounded by miles long of
desolate mountains & lakes.

43
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:26,500
In the night, there are crores of
stars in the sky...

44
00:06:27,235 --> 00:06:30,882
and besides that the salt of my sweat.
She will not be at all interested

45
00:06:31,181 --> 00:06:34,416
The girl should be asked about
all these. You can write to her

46
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,771
- Puran, have you loaded the car?
- Yes Sir

47
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:40,721
Kailash, would you
come with me to Allahabad?

48
00:06:41,226 --> 00:06:44,854
No, I'll stay in this mental
hospital for some more days.

49
00:06:45,442 --> 00:06:47,749
But whom and where to
should I write the letter?

50
00:06:48,425 --> 00:06:52,028
Miss Chandra, CIO-Post Master,
Allahabad.

51
00:06:52,263 --> 00:06:56,067
- CIO Post Master! Doesn't she have a residence?
- She has...

52
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,214
But you just want to know about
her character.

53
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,262
So what'll you
do by knowing her address?

54
00:07:01,992 --> 00:07:04,342
Don't write anything to upset her

55
00:07:17,723 --> 00:07:20,203
- Have you finished the letter, sister?
- I can't write anymore

56
00:07:22,328 --> 00:07:24,199
Please try it again
- What are all these then?

57
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,556
- What will our father say?
- That's the problem

58
00:07:28,636 --> 00:07:30,137
Otherwise I would have told him
on the first day that...

59
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:31,380
I don't want to go & live
in the forest

60
00:07:31,404 --> 00:07:34,443
And who knows,
if Mr Raj is blind or deaf

61
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:36,241
You should have told these to father.

62
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:37,981
I thought I'll solve the problem
by writing a letter.

63
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:39,623
But even writing is big problem.

64
00:07:40,665 --> 00:07:42,978
Oh! It's already 4.

65
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:45,692
I will play tennis at five then
a dance program at seven!

66
00:07:45,772 --> 00:07:49,897
And I have promised to go to
Nishad for dinner at 9

67
00:07:49,977 --> 00:07:52,191
So where is the time to write
a letter, and that too to a person...

68
00:07:52,215 --> 00:07:54,848
who wants a buffalo, not a wife
- Buffalo?

69
00:07:54,928 --> 00:07:57,903
Yes, one with a rope of
engagement tied in its neck...

70
00:07:57,983 --> 00:08:01,467
from childhood. He should
actually marry some hilly lady

71
00:08:03,433 --> 00:08:05,600
Will you please write a letter
on my behalf?

72
00:08:07,725 --> 00:08:11,712
Me? You want me to
write a letter, sister

73
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:16,143
My dear sister,
just write the letter!

74
00:08:16,223 --> 00:08:18,381
- But...
- No buts

75
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,401
But write in such a way
that he won't send a reply!

76
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,686
And if father comes to
know of it, then?

77
00:08:24,147 --> 00:08:28,115
He will never know as this is a
secret between you and me

78
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:31,537
- But what will I write?
- That's not a problem

79
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,604
Write that my body is full of
black stains as...

80
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:36,515
I had small pox in childhood
- Pox?

81
00:08:37,693 --> 00:08:44,375
- And I am blind in one eye.
- What?

82
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:49,174
I am cripple too. People call me
as bicycle -Bicycle?

83
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:53,794
Also write that I keep coughing
the whole night

84
00:08:56,006 --> 00:09:00,240
Don't forget about cough,
because males are scared of it

85
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:13,459
What is the use of Dr. Kailash,
if my daughters keeps coughing

86
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:18,212
Kailash has gone out. But I
am hearing the cough today only

87
00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:20,039
So you don't know?

88
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:26,547
- Were you coughing, Chandra?
- Not me, Nilu. Okay, mother...

89
00:09:26,763 --> 00:09:30,100
Have you written the letter?

90
00:09:31,585 --> 00:09:35,196
I'll post it today
- Show it to me

91
00:09:35,369 --> 00:09:37,313
What are you up to?
You leave, daughter

92
00:09:39,714 --> 00:09:43,700
- What is the matter?
- Should you read your children's letters?

93
00:09:47,174 --> 00:09:52,957
Chandra, the place where I live
doesn't have the brightness &...

94
00:09:53,682 --> 00:09:59,584
noise of the city. It is surrounded
by desolate mountains for miles.

95
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:03,185
The lake is also
visible from my writing place

96
00:10:04,515 --> 00:10:07,602
It seems now as if the lake has
fallen asleep under cover...

97
00:10:07,682 --> 00:10:10,871
and the cover has bright
stars of the night on it

98
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:16,510
The tall mountains guard the
sleeping lake, but the moonlight...

99
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,266
pass through without their
notice and plays with the...

100
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:24,563
lake waters the whole night.
You may not like this world

101
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:29,817
I don't want to force you to
come to me, but I surely want...

102
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:34,200
somebody to marry me so that
I become hers. Yours...

103
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,010
Dear...

104
00:10:51,021 --> 00:10:52,058
Dear...

105
00:10:57,745 --> 00:11:01,993
I want somebody to marry me,
so that I completely become hers

106
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,431
Dear...

107
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:05,203
Nilu, you should go to see Raj
for once, and his desolate place

108
00:12:05,873 --> 00:12:08,843
And the place is only forty miles
away from here.

109
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:15,062
You can go either by bus or by train
in the morning & come back in evening

110
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:17,322
'Will you go? '

111
00:12:20,186 --> 00:12:23,801
Have some tea
- Let me finish the letter, Puran Dada

112
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,410
- Are you writing to the bride?
- How do you know

113
00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:32,661
I know everything -I am going to
Allahabad for two days...

114
00:12:32,741 --> 00:12:35,515
as father has called me for
some business purpose

115
00:12:36,488 --> 00:12:37,591
Got it?

116
00:12:38,218 --> 00:12:40,218
Here goes Chandra's letter.
And here is the report!

117
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:44,792
What a problem! Where are
the envelopes?

118
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:51,115
Did you see the envelopes?

119
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,310
Take this

120
00:12:55,148 --> 00:12:59,364
- Finish your tea first.
- Don't make me panic, else I will put...

121
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:03,756
Chandra's letter in father's
report & vice versa by mistake

122
00:13:04,121 --> 00:13:09,840
Post this letter. I am leaving

123
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:17,473
I'm Chandra
- Which Chandra?

124
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:25,457
I mean, is there any letter for
Miss Chandra -Let me check

125
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,311
Take this
- Thank you

126
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:46,987
Ms. Chandra.

127
00:13:49,484 --> 00:13:50,554
Sister?

128
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:54,144
Since when have you started
reading my letters?

129
00:13:55,538 --> 00:13:58,566
- Sister, this is my letter.
- Yours, on my name?

130
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:03,546
Actually, I have started writing
letters in your name...

131
00:14:03,626 --> 00:14:05,861
after father gave you
the permission to write letters.

132
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:12,055
- Give it to me, sister! Please, sister!
- Wait a minute, I'll just come.

133
00:14:21,863 --> 00:14:26,021
Construction report!
Bricks, cements, coolie!

134
00:14:27,874 --> 00:14:30,938
I want to ask why this delay in
the Dam construction

135
00:14:31,247 --> 00:14:36,809
- Who will be responsible for the loss?
- Where is the loss?

136
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,701
Raj is looking after the business
on his own.

137
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:41,924
If you want to fight with elephants,
you should...

138
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:44,771
Please speak slowly. Your heart is...

139
00:14:44,944 --> 00:14:46,414
I am not shouting.

140
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:52,970
Why hasn't Raj arrived yet?
Go and give him a call

141
00:14:53,549 --> 00:14:57,696
- Have you send him a letter to come with the report?
- Yes

142
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:59,736
What are you waiting for?
Just go and call him up!

143
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,392
Why the delay in
constructing the Dam!

144
00:15:02,472 --> 00:15:05,656
I want to ask why do people
delay in taking birth?

145
00:15:06,013 --> 00:15:07,490
Slowly, Mr Rajbahadur

146
00:15:08,002 --> 00:15:08,765
Your heart is...

147
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:14,158
You keep silent. Why hasn't
Raj arrived yet?

148
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,986
What's the hurry, Uncle
- I am going to call Raj

149
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:22,467
- Raj?
- Yes, to you

150
00:15:30,391 --> 00:15:32,953
- You are...
- Me!

151
00:15:35,073 --> 00:15:38,976
You became angry without
reason. We just wanted report

152
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:46,247
This is the report, father, sorry
for the delay -So you are here

153
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:52,198
Chandra, the stars are still shining,
but the brightness is not like before.

154
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:54,392
Moonlight still plays
with the lake water,

155
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:55,819
but it has lost its charm too!

156
00:15:56,814 --> 00:15:58,284
What are you reading?
Read properly

157
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:02,478
The mountains are still on guard,

158
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:06,552
Since you have come, I have lost
interest in Dam work, Chandra

159
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:10,040
It's enough Secretary.
We have got the answer

160
00:16:11,873 --> 00:16:13,829
Raj! Raj!

161
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,326
Excuse me

162
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:23,639
There must be a letter for
Miss Chandra, in care of Post Master

163
00:16:23,948 --> 00:16:26,389
Please give that to me as I have
put some important papers...

164
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:29,004
in that envelope by mistake.
Please give it to me.

165
00:16:31,072 --> 00:16:36,293
You should be careful before
sealing the letter

166
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,158
Fretting is needless
after you messed up!

167
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:42,218
Hail Lord Ram!

168
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:45,987
What a lecture you have given to
me. I'll just have to travel...

169
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,796
100 miles to get that letter

170
00:16:47,876 --> 00:16:49,753
Fretting is needless!

171
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:55,947
You might get beaten, someday!

172
00:16:58,941 --> 00:17:01,811
I'll come back by the evening, as
the distance is only 40 miles

173
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:04,477
- But where are you going?
- That's a secret

174
00:17:04,692 --> 00:17:08,222
I kept your secret, now it is
your turn to keep my secret.

175
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:11,762
Didn't you know about give and take!

176
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:15,805
But where are going & whom are
you going to meet?

177
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:18,043
Didn't I tell you sister?
This is a secret.

178
00:17:18,215 --> 00:17:19,837
But who is he?

179
00:17:20,301 --> 00:17:21,941
I'll tell you everything
after coming back

180
00:17:22,237 --> 00:17:23,748
What will I tell if my father
asks about you?

181
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:26,885
Give him some excuse,

182
00:17:27,156 --> 00:17:28,832
- Excuse?
- Yes.

183
00:17:30,043 --> 00:17:31,837
As you are an expert.

184
00:17:32,432 --> 00:17:34,832
Tell him that I have gone for a
picnic with my friends -Nilu.

185
00:17:35,545 --> 00:17:39,273
Slowly, if mother comes to know,
she will create problems

186
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:43,396
But come back by the evening
- Ok

187
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:49,589
Leela! Sheela! Priyatama!

188
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:53,673
So all of you are saying that
Nilu hasn't gone to your place

189
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,315
But you are saying that she has
gone for a picnic

190
00:17:57,124 --> 00:17:59,216
Chandra, you told me that,

191
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,573
Why are you crying?
Why don't you say clearly.

192
00:18:07,437 --> 00:18:12,280
- Actually we had a fight at night...
- What happened at the night?

193
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,074
- Fight?
- Yes, mother.

194
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:16,169
And she told me that
she will go far away from me.

195
00:18:16,193 --> 00:18:18,798
I told you that she has gone...
for a picnic out of my fear only.

196
00:18:19,241 --> 00:18:21,873
- I thought she'll come back.
- She is not coming back!

197
00:18:21,953 --> 00:18:24,133
You shouldn't quarrel with your
own sister like this

198
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:26,338
What's the matter?
Why is she not coming back?

199
00:18:26,418 --> 00:18:30,818
Please do something,
spread the news, inform the police.

200
00:18:32,274 --> 00:18:33,485
Police?

201
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:42,740
Have you checked this
- Yes

202
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:55,554
- Is this bus coming from Allahabad?
- Yes

203
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,156
- What's your name?
- Sulochana.

204
00:18:58,935 --> 00:19:02,326
- What's this going on?
- We are searching for a girl

205
00:19:17,584 --> 00:19:22,135
- Where are you going?
- Me, that way

206
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:23,789
That car?

207
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:26,693
- What is your name?
- Reshma

208
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:24,505
- Who are you? Where have you emerged from?
- I don't know

209
00:20:24,883 --> 00:20:30,551
- You don't know! That's great.
- Where are we now -In Hell

210
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:32,676
This is a very nice place

211
00:20:34,753 --> 00:20:38,458
See, I become a very dangerous
person while I am angry

212
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:43,296
Reveal your identity and your
programme -I don't know

213
00:20:45,684 --> 00:20:48,891
So your ticket was up to here only.
Now get down

214
00:20:49,121 --> 00:20:51,322
Police will anyway find you

215
00:20:58,148 --> 00:20:59,856
Does she think of me as an idiot?

216
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:06,918
By now you must have realised
that I am a gentleman

217
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:12,951
Please tell me your destination.
I'll reach you there safely

218
00:22:13,145 --> 00:22:15,777
I have already told you that
I don't know, -Don't scold me

219
00:22:15,857 --> 00:22:19,041
Don't be angry. I know
all stories about girls like you

220
00:22:19,989 --> 00:22:23,535
- What story?
- A girl like you ran away from the house...

221
00:22:23,615 --> 00:22:26,984
after trapping a boy and
her love vanished in four days.

222
00:22:27,064 --> 00:22:29,026
Then the girl returned home
like a good girl

223
00:22:29,106 --> 00:22:30,626
Hail Lord Ram!

224
00:22:30,821 --> 00:22:34,301
- And what happened to the boy?
- He died in grief drinking blood

225
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,690
But I was talking about the girl.

226
00:22:37,673 --> 00:22:40,344
- What a story it was!
- That's why I am asking you to go back.

227
00:22:41,003 --> 00:22:43,847
Life is harsher than dream

228
00:22:44,192 --> 00:22:46,529
I promise, I will make you
reach your home safely

229
00:22:47,608 --> 00:22:49,968
You are very fond of blowing
your trumpet of gentlemanliness

230
00:23:07,337 --> 00:23:08,695
Will you have to pump it now?

231
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,575
No, the trumpet has blasted.
There is a post office at a...

232
00:23:15,655 --> 00:23:18,175
distance of 5 miles. I'll have to
send a letter to my servant

233
00:23:18,418 --> 00:23:20,180
- Post office?
- Yeah...

234
00:23:20,505 --> 00:23:22,425
I also have to send a letter
from the post office

235
00:23:23,488 --> 00:23:26,935
I am not that gentle that, after
giving you a lift till here...

236
00:23:27,163 --> 00:23:30,579
I'll carry you for 5 miles
on my shoulders

237
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,952
No, I am not that gentle!

238
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:37,592
I can walk up to there. If
you can't walk, I'll post your letter

239
00:23:37,769 --> 00:23:39,647
He must be a magician
- Who?

240
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:42,582
To write to whom you
are ready to walk 5 miles

241
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:44,855
Listen,

242
00:24:02,094 --> 00:24:07,143
Feeling tired? Come. we will
reach after crossing the pond

243
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:08,657
Come on!

244
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,711
- Some people are very lucky.
- Who? - Like you

245
00:24:25,511 --> 00:24:27,431
You can have your work done
by anyone you come by

246
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:30,198
See, even the bridge is also
broken today

247
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:46,256
What a problem I have
embraced to my heart!

248
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:49,498
I am not the one to move back
- Meaning?

249
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:52,704
Do you know how to swim?

250
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:56,685
No, but at the most
I'll only get drowned.

251
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:03,547
- Now I am convinced -Of what?
- Of that fool being a magician...

252
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:05,739
for whom you are even putting
your life to risk

253
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:07,055
Well, do whatever you want!

254
00:25:07,249 --> 00:25:09,277
I will sit and enjoy the game

255
00:25:29,403 --> 00:25:30,830
Great!

256
00:25:40,883 --> 00:25:42,083
Help!

257
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:59,868
- You must be enjoying a lot.
- Yes

258
00:26:01,262 --> 00:26:03,766
There is not a sympathiser even
- Why?

259
00:26:03,846 --> 00:26:06,167
People want to sit on head
whenever they get a chance

260
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:23,147
I have searched in every corner
of the city, but didn't find Nilu

261
00:26:31,512 --> 00:26:35,059
I think Nilu has gone to Riwa
to meet my brother

262
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,361
I will send the driver soon

263
00:26:47,566 --> 00:26:49,930
You told me that you also have
to write a letter

264
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:52,865
No, I have changed my mind

265
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:55,869
Why? Has she changed her
rented house?

266
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,700
- I remembered my house on your mentioning the word.
- What?

267
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,150
- How will we go home now?
- The same way as we came

268
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,700
No, now the water must be even
deeper, and it's dark now

269
00:27:05,035 --> 00:27:07,465
Seems we will've to arrange for
some shelter in nearby village

270
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:09,418
What a problem I embraced!

271
00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:12,107
You consider me to be a problem!
Then I'll leave now itself

272
00:27:12,354 --> 00:27:16,149
No, I didn't mean that
- You,

273
00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:19,922
Shut up, let's go and ask the
postmaster for some shelter

274
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:21,684
Come on!

275
00:27:35,295 --> 00:27:37,943
This is the only room. Spend the
night here somehow.

276
00:27:38,744 --> 00:27:41,252
You both are wet. Let me
arrange some clothes

277
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:43,457
There is no need for that.
Please go and have rest.

278
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:44,820
We will dry our clothes somehow.

279
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,776
- Here is the lamp.
- Thanks.

280
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:49,295
Come on, madam.

281
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:50,960
Hail Lord Krishna!

282
00:27:53,544 --> 00:27:56,677
You told him that we'll dry
our clothes? What will we wear now?

283
00:27:56,939 --> 00:27:58,561
- What?
- What are we going to wear?

284
00:28:04,485 --> 00:28:06,987
There is a blanket. Now change
your clothes immediately

285
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,924
Otherwise, you will turn this
room to a hospital by sneezing

286
00:28:13,502 --> 00:28:17,269
Close the door from inside
- Don't scold me -Shut up!

287
00:28:57,178 --> 00:29:05,088
- Are you not yet asleep?
- No, I am not feeling sleepy

288
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:09,269
Are you still thinking about
that fool -May be

289
00:29:09,946 --> 00:29:13,683
Have you ever seen him? - No
- Blind love!

290
00:29:15,134 --> 00:29:20,002
- Haven't you ever fallen in love with anybody?
- I have

291
00:29:20,647 --> 00:29:22,312
- With whom?
- My dreams

292
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:25,821
But in love for someone
- You haven't run away from home!

293
00:29:26,463 --> 00:29:30,084
I have only run after the moon
from childhood, but...

294
00:29:30,164 --> 00:29:35,993
still not able to catch it. It
feels as if I have seen you...

295
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:39,683
- somewhere before.
- In your dreams probably

296
00:29:41,306 --> 00:29:44,192
Yes, I dream a lot

297
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:10,595
"I don't know those eyes,
can't recognize her heart."

298
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:14,085
"Still she has made a place
in my heart"

299
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:20,940
"Every part of my body
began to smile,"

300
00:30:21,317 --> 00:30:24,874
"I don't know those eyes,
can't recognize her heart."

301
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:28,431
"Still she has made a place
in my heart"

302
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:35,598
"Every part of my body
began to smile,"

303
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:50,312
"Don't know whose voice comes
and teases my heart & goes."

304
00:30:51,761 --> 00:30:59,339
"Don't know whose voice comes
and teases my heart & goes."

305
00:31:00,842 --> 00:31:04,306
"I feel shy by listening to him"

306
00:31:04,518 --> 00:31:07,817
"Who is this, who has
come inside me"

307
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:14,670
"Every part of my body
began to smile,"

308
00:31:14,962 --> 00:31:18,292
"I don't know those eyes,
can't recognize her heart."

309
00:31:18,372 --> 00:31:21,989
"Still she has made a place
in my heart"

310
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:29,200
"And made me suffer everyday"

311
00:31:36,358 --> 00:31:39,849
"I was looking for her
in the stars..."

312
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:43,893
"And in the cold winds of Spring"

313
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:48,681
"I was looking for her
in the stars..."

314
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:52,260
"And in the cold winds of Spring"

315
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:55,812
"I am not lesser
than anybody..."

316
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:58,784
"Then why did you hide your
face from me..."

317
00:31:59,384 --> 00:32:06,011
"And made me suffer everyday"

318
00:32:06,405 --> 00:32:09,919
"I don't know those eyes,
can't recognize her heart."

319
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,411
"Still she has made a place
in my heart"

320
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:20,286
"Every part of my body
began to smile,"

321
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:31,086
"I have fallen in love
without seeing him"

322
00:32:31,166 --> 00:32:35,126
"And I am ready to give my life
for him If I see him"

323
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:39,894
"I have fallen in love
without seeing him"

324
00:32:39,974 --> 00:32:43,937
"And I am ready to give my life
for him If I see him"

325
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:52,111
"Just tell me for once, what is
this play of yours, oh magician!"

326
00:32:52,284 --> 00:32:59,040
"It made every part of my
body smile"

327
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:02,672
"I don't know those eyes,
can't recognize her heart."

328
00:33:02,752 --> 00:33:06,120
"Still she has made a place
in my heart"

329
00:33:06,315 --> 00:33:13,893
"Every part of my body
began to smile,"

330
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,417
Open the door

331
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:33,279
Open the door

332
00:33:39,829 --> 00:33:42,882
- Who locked the door?
- He who left

333
00:33:43,257 --> 00:33:46,476
- Left?
- But not before making all the arrangements

334
00:33:47,387 --> 00:33:52,382
- What arrangements?
- He sent a telegram to Police and told them

335
00:33:52,642 --> 00:33:56,177
that a girl has run away from
Allahabad. Police will come here shortly.

336
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:58,578
- Who is he to do all these?
- He also said the...

337
00:33:58,762 --> 00:34:00,439
same thing that had he known
you, he would have dragged...

338
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:02,037
you home by holding her ears

339
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:08,844
Younger sister is here, Sir

340
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,431
- Neelu!
- Dear!

341
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,918
Are you mad to run away
from home like this?

342
00:34:17,998 --> 00:34:20,146
Yes, you should not
run away like this.

343
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:22,812
And quarrels are normal between
sisters. You are a silly girl.

344
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:26,220
Even if you quarreled with her you
shouldn't have run from the house!

345
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:28,859
Go & beg pardon from your sister

346
00:34:31,172 --> 00:34:35,777
I say that home without
wrangle is like a graveyard!

347
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:38,846
Please come, Inspector

348
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,810
But how did you get the idea
of quarrel, sister?

349
00:34:44,364 --> 00:34:47,474
Had I not said that, they would
have asked a lot of questions

350
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:51,841
- Now tell me who was he?
- Who!

351
00:34:52,387 --> 00:34:57,877
The person who sent you the letter
- I couldn't meet him

352
00:34:58,246 --> 00:35:02,658
- Why?
- He was not there. But what happened to him?

353
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:06,216
- Whom?
- The person for whom I wrote on your behalf?

354
00:35:06,505 --> 00:35:12,867
I was about to tell my dad that
I'm not interested in marrying Raj

355
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:27,219
This is your letter. Did you get
the earlier letter -Yes

356
00:35:35,326 --> 00:35:37,186
- This is your letter.
- Thank you.

357
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:57,488
- What happened?
- I tore the envelope.

358
00:35:57,921 --> 00:35:59,552
I wanted to see
the sender's address.

359
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:11,619
Oh! You!

360
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,760
So you have come back.

361
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,960
You agreed to my advice!

362
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,463
How is your fool?

363
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,580
- What is the meaning of this cry?
- This is the meaning

364
00:36:30,709 --> 00:36:31,709
Which girl did I tease?

365
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,861
I say, why did you hit me?

366
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:36,861
Who told you that I teased her?

367
00:36:38,137 --> 00:36:39,802
- How dare you..
- Hey get lost.

368
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:53,974
Oh God! What are you guys doing?

369
00:37:01,544 --> 00:37:04,477
If you want to fight, go and
fight in your house.

370
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:08,089
Naidu!
What's going on?

371
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:10,907
- Please call the police.
- Yeah sure!

372
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:13,049
Police! Police!

373
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:27,557
Hey stop all this!

374
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,994
Hail Lord Ram!

375
00:37:39,492 --> 00:37:41,394
You will be beaten someday, huh?

376
00:37:50,388 --> 00:37:52,240
So all these happened just
for an envelope

377
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:57,879
Yes, I wanted to see the stamp
of the sender's place -Seen it

378
00:37:58,421 --> 00:38:01,853
No, that girl would have
sent me to the jail.

379
00:38:02,021 --> 00:38:05,305
Luckily, a friend of mine came
there & rescued me from police

380
00:38:07,102 --> 00:38:12,929
- Have you met her after that incident?
- No, but I am pining to to meet her.

381
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:16,924
She is the first
ever to make place in my heart

382
00:38:18,918 --> 00:38:26,115
When I see her, I feel some
music. But she loves some fool

383
00:38:31,524 --> 00:38:33,684
And who is the other whose
character you wanted to know

384
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,541
You had started falling in
love with her too

385
00:38:37,404 --> 00:38:42,378
Chandra! I have never seen her.
I just imagined a picture of her...

386
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:48,746
through her letters.
But as soon as I meet this girl...

387
00:38:49,654 --> 00:38:55,406
Chandra's image begins to fade
away. I don't see anything else.

388
00:38:56,822 --> 00:39:00,017
What are you going to tell your
father? What about Chandra?

389
00:39:01,276 --> 00:39:06,328
- I have asked Chandra to meet me.
- Where? - In the Dam.

390
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:14,189
But I now feel that it was not good.

391
00:39:17,503 --> 00:39:22,056
If she comes to know that I have sold
myself to somebody else, what'll she do?

392
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:28,208
If you want to meet me, come
over to the desolate place...

393
00:39:28,288 --> 00:39:30,768
where you will spend the life
with me.

394
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:34,072
I'll come to receive
you in Sripur station.

395
00:39:35,201 --> 00:39:36,876
But how will you recognise me?

396
00:39:37,438 --> 00:39:40,656
I'll will put a rose in my coat.

397
00:39:40,974 --> 00:39:48,968
No, I'll tell him clearly that
I am Nilu, not Chandra, who hates Raj.

398
00:39:49,406 --> 00:39:52,368
"I was looking for her
in the stars..."

399
00:39:52,553 --> 00:39:55,915
"And in the cold winds of Spring"

400
00:39:55,995 --> 00:39:59,472
"I am not lesser
than anybody..."

401
00:39:59,552 --> 00:40:02,834
"Then why did you hide your
face from me..."

402
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:09,839
"And made me suffer everyday"

403
00:40:17,374 --> 00:40:20,498
"I have fallen in love
without seeing him"

404
00:40:20,578 --> 00:40:24,422
"And I am ready to give my life
for him If I see him"

405
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:29,297
"I have fallen in love
without seeing him"

406
00:40:29,377 --> 00:40:32,659
"And I am ready to give my life
for him If I see him"

407
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:41,587
"Just tell me for once, what is
this play of yours, oh magician!"

408
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:45,847
"It made every part of my
body smile"

409
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:54,773
- You?
- I didn't know that you came this far to meet me

410
00:40:55,003 --> 00:40:57,804
- To meet you!
- Why? What's wrong in me?

411
00:40:58,301 --> 00:41:01,808
People say that I have a very
beautiful face -They are blind

412
00:41:02,765 --> 00:41:04,106
Well that's a possibility!

413
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,519
What happened?

414
00:41:09,693 --> 00:41:12,758
I didn't expect that you'll
appear here too.

415
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:17,644
I understood. That fool must
have come to receive you...

416
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:19,654
and may have gone back seeing
both of us together

417
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:20,958
See, how jealous the male
can be.

418
00:41:21,101 --> 00:41:24,253
I feel like smashing your face
- Do it as you have almost...

419
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:27,929
done it in the post office.
See, if that fool works in...

420
00:41:28,009 --> 00:41:30,543
some Dam, I can give you a
safe lift up to there

421
00:41:30,723 --> 00:41:33,984
No, I'll not go in your vehicle.

422
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,718
Madam, you should definitely
fight with me...

423
00:41:59,798 --> 00:42:05,101
- but why are you fighting with yourself? Board in the car.
- I hate you.

424
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:11,468
I am also a free man.
I'll go whenever I feel like

425
00:42:22,267 --> 00:42:23,273
Hello!

426
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:29,236
How are you? I thought you must
be feeling hungry. Eat this food.

427
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:35,791
You seem to be quite eager to
meet that fool.

428
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:41,964
But I know you will be quite depressed to
meet him. I'll give you lift, come.

429
00:42:42,449 --> 00:42:46,388
I will reach you to that fool
immediately, I promise. Come

430
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,850
Listen, have a seat!

431
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,293
This donkey is of excellent breed!
Come on!

432
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,238
Puran! Puran!

433
00:42:56,243 --> 00:42:57,141
What is it, sir?

434
00:42:57,221 --> 00:43:02,810
If a girl comes to meet me,
tell her that I'm near the hill.

435
00:43:17,313 --> 00:43:20,480
Raj. Raj.

436
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:42,403
Oh, you?

437
00:43:43,635 --> 00:43:47,112
As if the lake has fallen asleep
and it is covered with a...

438
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:52,325
blanket full of thousands
of bright stars.

439
00:43:52,825 --> 00:44:00,825
The mountains keep on guard
- But moonlight passes through,

440
00:44:02,256 --> 00:44:05,527
and plays with the
lake water for all the night!

441
00:44:05,808 --> 00:44:10,936
- Raj!
- I told you that you'll be depressed to meet that fool

442
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:15,351
Even I am also not the one,
whom you are taking me to be

443
00:44:15,431 --> 00:44:19,646
- I don't want to know anything, just want to feel.
- But Raj

444
00:44:21,463 --> 00:44:28,359
Don't speak. Just listen to what
the Shehnai wants to speak.

445
00:45:00,544 --> 00:45:06,522
"The anklets are producing
a melodious sound"

446
00:45:06,868 --> 00:45:11,766
"I have arrived with my
merry dancing"

447
00:45:11,846 --> 00:45:18,187
"The anklets are producing
a melodious sound"

448
00:45:34,598 --> 00:45:39,570
"I put on my make up in front of
the mirror of the moon"

449
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:49,063
"And brought hopes in the
palanquin of the stars"

450
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,943
"See both the bride & the bride-
groom are so happy"

451
00:45:54,023 --> 00:45:57,106
"The veil can't cover my beauty!"

452
00:45:57,186 --> 00:45:58,716
"It exudes through my eyes!"

453
00:45:58,796 --> 00:46:05,268
"The anklets are producing
a melodious sound"

454
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:31,624
"Union of two hearts
is known as marriage..."

455
00:46:36,425 --> 00:46:41,452
"The one who is loyal
with each other..."

456
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:44,155
"The earth and the sky..."

457
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:46,274
"This is a time for reunion..."

458
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:49,268
"I glimmer like moon!"

459
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,068
"My bindiya (dot on
forehead) is shining..."

460
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:57,560
"The anklets are producing
a melodious sound"

461
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:19,225
"Ambience around me
is filled with love!"

462
00:47:23,689 --> 00:47:28,986
"My heart sings the song of love!"

463
00:47:29,776 --> 00:47:33,408
"Look the gathering is
here with hands in hands..."

464
00:47:33,488 --> 00:47:35,041
"My garland is fragrant..."

465
00:47:35,121 --> 00:47:36,695
"Along with my beloved..."

466
00:47:36,775 --> 00:47:38,230
"My heart is intoxicated..."

467
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:44,696
"The anklets are producing
a melodious sound"

468
00:47:44,776 --> 00:47:46,101
"I am all decked up!"

469
00:47:46,181 --> 00:47:47,615
"But my body aches!"

470
00:47:47,695 --> 00:47:49,528
"My eyes crave for you!"

471
00:47:49,608 --> 00:47:55,928
"The anklets are producing
a melodious sound"

472
00:47:56,008 --> 00:48:01,690
"The anklets are producing
a melodious sound"

473
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:07,128
"The anklets are producing
a melodious sound"

474
00:48:08,675 --> 00:48:11,103
They have just got married.
Please bless them.

475
00:48:12,696 --> 00:48:15,765
May you have all the
happiness of the world

476
00:48:16,837 --> 00:48:17,864
This is for you.

477
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:23,667
Chandra, please bless them
- Me? - This suits you

478
00:48:31,832 --> 00:48:34,275
Sir, that's very nice of you.
May God make you happy!

479
00:48:37,345 --> 00:48:39,951
She was really looking like a doll.

480
00:48:41,334 --> 00:48:45,539
Now the groom will take her to the hut
which he has made with his hands

481
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:50,924
I also have made a hut with my own
hands & I'll take Chandra to that hut.

482
00:48:51,004 --> 00:48:54,879
But Raj, if I am
not your Chandra then?

483
00:48:57,216 --> 00:49:00,222
Then I'll destroy the hut.

484
00:49:00,482 --> 00:49:03,547
Spring has appeared in this desolate
place after your arrival here.

485
00:49:03,627 --> 00:49:08,744
If you go away, only dust'll be here

486
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:15,435
You had told me that life is
harsher than dreams

487
00:49:16,655 --> 00:49:18,719
If you wish, the dream can be
transformed to life

488
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:21,759
I will speak to my father
tomorrow itself -Raj!

489
00:49:23,152 --> 00:49:24,309
Yes, Chandra.

490
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:33,109
I know why have you come here.

491
00:49:33,379 --> 00:49:36,155
You have seen the character
and now you want to see the face.

492
00:49:37,476 --> 00:49:42,644
I have seen the face also.
I accept this relation.

493
00:49:42,724 --> 00:49:44,038
I don't accept the relation.

494
00:49:44,118 --> 00:49:45,438
- Chandra?
- That's right, mother!

495
00:49:45,768 --> 00:49:48,272
I don't want to spend
my life in the forest.

496
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:49,953
- Chandra!
- That's, right, dad!

497
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:52,231
I have decided this after a lot of
consideration.

498
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:55,602
I have read his letters
about the desolate place.

499
00:49:56,201 --> 00:50:00,374
But sister - Be silent.
This is a question of my life.

500
00:50:06,049 --> 00:50:13,705
This is the road, this is our
house & this is our small garden

501
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:18,460
I want to grow all the flowers
in my garden, Kailash

502
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,638
Champa, jasmine,
marigold, rose, narcissus!

503
00:50:25,378 --> 00:50:30,675
Chandra will fill a lot of
colours & fragrance to my life

504
00:50:33,443 --> 00:50:36,556
I was showing the drawing of
my house to Doctor

505
00:50:37,551 --> 00:50:38,973
Why don't you take a look at it?
Here it is.

506
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:41,195
Raj, Chandra has refused this
marriage

507
00:50:41,562 --> 00:50:44,543
Both side of the road will be filled
with flowers. What did you say?

508
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:46,652
Chandra has refused this
marriage.

509
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:48,630
What?

510
00:50:51,629 --> 00:50:55,643
I planned the whole garden
& the house for her only

511
00:50:56,029 --> 00:50:58,766
Doesn't matter Raj. I'll find a
better girl than Chandra

512
00:50:58,846 --> 00:51:04,645
No, I'll meet Chandra and
ask her about this

513
00:51:10,223 --> 00:51:16,271
- Is Mr Raj at home?
- Both Sir & Madam has gone

514
00:51:16,482 --> 00:51:19,382
- Is Chandra at home?
- Tell him that I am not at home.

515
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:25,282
- I'll not go without meeting her.
- Close the door

516
00:51:27,456 --> 00:51:30,174
This is a punishment.
I'll open the door.

517
00:51:31,261 --> 00:51:35,458
Please think a little
- Beware, don't open the door

518
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:08,299
I should go and tell Raj
everything.

519
00:52:08,645 --> 00:52:10,937
'It doesn't matter if
he hates you or discards you! '

520
00:52:11,499 --> 00:52:12,818
But tell him the truth.

521
00:52:12,898 --> 00:52:15,899
Raj! Raj!

522
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:41,846
Raj is not having high fever, but
this cough is not good for him

523
00:52:43,870 --> 00:52:47,709
I will take an x-ray tomorrow.
He'll be alright in 2-3 days.

524
00:52:49,891 --> 00:52:51,220
But this cough...

525
00:53:13,275 --> 00:53:14,334
Raj.

526
00:53:19,135 --> 00:53:20,356
Chandra!

527
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:31,245
Have you come to see whether
I am dead or alive, Chandra?

528
00:53:31,383 --> 00:53:34,971
No, I have come to beg
forgiven from you

529
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:46,545
Raj, I am not Chandra,

530
00:53:48,679 --> 00:53:53,862
I am not Chandra, but her
younger sister Nilu

531
00:53:54,442 --> 00:53:56,580
Chandra has refused this
marriage from the beginning.

532
00:53:57,436 --> 00:54:00,928
I had written that letter
on behalf of her

533
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:12,862
Nilu -Please forgive me.

534
00:54:17,717 --> 00:54:24,710
Don't speak. Just listen to what
the mountain is speaking

535
00:54:29,177 --> 00:54:30,907
Listen to what the waterfall
is speaking

536
00:55:05,178 --> 00:55:08,045
I am going to meet your father
day after tomorrow.

537
00:55:08,324 --> 00:55:15,449
- Will he refuse the marriage?
- No. - And Chandra? You?

538
00:55:22,595 --> 00:55:29,508
- You are having fever.
- Me? No, I am now young.

539
00:55:40,044 --> 00:55:48,044
"I don't know how much love I
have for him in my heart?"

540
00:55:48,876 --> 00:55:54,443
"Why do I love him so much?"

541
00:55:54,649 --> 00:55:58,076
"I don't know how much love I
have for him"

542
00:56:09,514 --> 00:56:17,514
"If I do things after thinking well
I would not cross the limits"

543
00:56:21,255 --> 00:56:29,255
"Why do I act with ignorance &
then die out of confusion."

544
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:35,664
"Then die out of confusion."

545
00:56:35,744 --> 00:56:38,464
"Why do I love him so much?"

546
00:56:38,544 --> 00:56:44,303
"I don't know how much love I
have for him in my heart?"

547
00:56:44,383 --> 00:56:50,108
"Why do I love him so much?"

548
00:56:50,188 --> 00:56:53,038
"I don't know how much love I
have for him"

549
00:57:08,194 --> 00:57:15,595
"Every time I fight with the
entangled hair of mine."

550
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:21,124
"And apply kajal in my eyes"

551
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:29,405
"I would not have dressed up like
like this if he is not coming."

552
00:57:35,892 --> 00:57:39,124
"Why do I love him so much?"

553
00:57:39,204 --> 00:57:44,746
"I don't know how much love I
have for him in my heart?"

554
00:57:44,941 --> 00:57:50,422
"Why do I love him so much?"

555
00:57:50,502 --> 00:57:53,503
"I don't know how much love I
have for him"

556
00:58:05,579 --> 00:58:13,579
"The first love gives
a sweet pain."

557
00:58:17,308 --> 00:58:25,308
Why do I fall in this problem
despite knowing all this?

558
00:58:31,622 --> 00:58:34,347
"Why do I love him so much?"

559
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:40,358
"I don't know how much love I
have for him in my heart?"

560
00:58:40,438 --> 00:58:46,023
"Why do I love him so much?"

561
00:58:46,103 --> 00:58:49,374
"I don't know how much love I
have for him"

562
00:58:49,579 --> 00:58:54,520
Why are you dressed up so
nicely today? Who is he?

563
00:58:54,985 --> 00:58:58,429
You will get to know soon
- Is he coming to meet father -Yes

564
00:58:58,801 --> 00:59:01,236
Somebody wants to meet you,
younger sister

565
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:16,976
Your radio
- Please keep it inside

566
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:36,038
Had it been a minor disease, I
would have kept it a secret from Raj.

567
00:59:38,543 --> 00:59:41,133
But he has severe tuberculosis

568
00:59:42,155 --> 00:59:43,809
- Tuberculosis?
- Yes.

569
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:48,424
Then my worst fear has come true
- Fear?

570
00:59:49,874 --> 00:59:51,138
Yeah, Kailash.

571
00:59:52,263 --> 00:59:57,150
Raj's mother also
died of same disease.

572
00:59:58,825 --> 01:00:04,358
Therefore, I kept Raj always in fresh air,
away from the pollution of the city.

573
01:00:06,090 --> 01:00:11,157
I was feeling happy thinking
that Raj has been spared.

574
01:00:11,993 --> 01:00:14,341
I will try my best to save Raj

575
01:00:20,111 --> 01:00:21,657
No, Kailash

576
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:26,773
We had tried our best to
save his mother too

577
01:00:28,977 --> 01:00:31,711
But nobody could come in
the way of death

578
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:39,635
How happy he is today...

579
01:00:40,133 --> 01:00:43,382
as he is going to have a talk
with the father of his would-be bride.

580
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:47,614
How'll he react now?

581
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:50,468
I haven't told him yet,
now tell him

582
01:00:50,548 --> 01:00:56,837
I won't be able to tell him.
You do that job

583
01:01:03,765 --> 01:01:05,148
Hello, Kailash!

584
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,170
Kailash, why are you wearing
that sad look

585
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,683
Today is the happy day!

586
01:01:17,267 --> 01:01:19,775
- What is this?
- Your x-ray

587
01:01:20,499 --> 01:01:24,319
I was coming to you anyway to
get treated for this cough

588
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:28,867
Otherwise Nilu considers me as
an old man. Why don't you smile

589
01:01:29,569 --> 01:01:30,726
Why are you so sad?

590
01:01:31,029 --> 01:01:35,240
- It's not T.B. anyway.
- Yes Raj. You are suffering from T.B.

591
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,204
One of your lungs has become
completely damaged

592
01:01:39,969 --> 01:01:42,442
What are you saying?

593
01:01:43,093 --> 01:01:45,331
One of your lungs has become
completely damaged

594
01:01:53,213 --> 01:01:54,802
Why did you choose
this day to tell me?

595
01:01:55,926 --> 01:01:58,974
Oh! Your Prince didn't turn up
- He'll arrive shortly, sister

596
01:01:59,245 --> 01:02:02,990
There is nothing to worry,
he'll come. I'll leave as it is late

597
01:02:14,705 --> 01:02:18,104
Daughter, I'll leave now,
as I am getting late for a meeting

598
01:03:07,741 --> 01:03:10,054
I'm taking you to the Sanatorium.

599
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:18,562
- Do you have any message for Nilu?
- No. - But she will be waiting for you

600
01:03:20,443 --> 01:03:28,118
Let her wait, as it is better than
marrying one who is dying.

601
01:03:39,861 --> 01:03:46,715
"Don't know why..."

602
01:03:46,964 --> 01:03:54,964
"Don't know why I love him
so much."

603
01:03:56,899 --> 01:04:04,899
"Why do I love him so much?"

604
01:04:07,991 --> 01:04:15,991
"If I had known that
I will cry for him!"

605
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:27,200
"I would have never loved him!"

606
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:35,178
"Don't know why..."

607
01:04:47,231 --> 01:04:50,063
I am allotting you the
finest room in this sanatorium.

608
01:04:51,025 --> 01:04:54,928
This patient has left
just before your arrival

609
01:04:55,534 --> 01:04:56,534
Welcome.

610
01:05:00,118 --> 01:05:01,512
Please come inside.

611
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:05,799
This is the best room of our
Sanatorium. Hope you'd like it

612
01:05:06,225 --> 01:05:08,615
Spacious and roomy!

613
01:05:09,069 --> 01:05:11,491
Just take a look at this scene!

614
01:05:15,145 --> 01:05:19,935
It has desolate mountains
surrounding it for miles

615
01:05:20,237 --> 01:05:26,874
There is the lake down the
mountains & stars in the sky

616
01:05:27,296 --> 01:05:31,242
You are very lucky as this view
is seen only from this room

617
01:05:31,322 --> 01:05:33,890
And the room has been vacant
today for first time in 20 years

618
01:05:34,085 --> 01:05:35,750
The patient has left just a few
hours before your arrival

619
01:05:35,774 --> 01:05:42,484
Doctor, - Let him continue.
I have set foot into a new world today

620
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:45,002
Yes, doctor.

621
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,478
Well that's fine.

622
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:49,705
Please have a seat.
I'll just come.

623
01:06:00,206 --> 01:06:04,736
Don't lose heart, my son. You
will be alright soon

624
01:06:05,655 --> 01:06:10,898
You'll be alright soon
- I know

625
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:20,426
Please don't tell Nilu where I
am & what is my disease, father

626
01:06:23,049 --> 01:06:30,108
You also, Kailash. Tell her that I
have left for an unknown place

627
01:06:32,703 --> 01:06:34,757
I know her.

628
01:06:37,622 --> 01:06:41,788
She will not object to marrying
me inspite of my disease.

629
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,224
But how can I put
ashes of my funeral...

630
01:06:48,248 --> 01:06:50,793
in her forehead consciously,
in place of vermillion

631
01:06:59,555 --> 01:07:05,143
Where are you,
when will you come, Raj?

632
01:07:11,851 --> 01:07:13,209
When will you come, Raj?

633
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:47,832
"The night is dark and
the morning is far away"

634
01:07:47,912 --> 01:07:52,339
"There is only destruction
on these roads."

635
01:07:52,787 --> 01:07:57,207
"The night is dark and
the morning is far away"

636
01:07:57,579 --> 01:08:02,120
"There is only destruction
on these roads."

637
01:08:19,505 --> 01:08:24,195
"Although I want to come,
I can't come out"

638
01:08:24,274 --> 01:08:28,558
"I don't have any support too"

639
01:08:28,984 --> 01:08:33,542
"Although I want to come,
I can't come out"

640
01:08:33,752 --> 01:08:36,995
"I don't have any support too"

641
01:08:38,457 --> 01:08:43,006
"I have lost my goal, the road
is also difficult."

642
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:47,748
"And the moon is also under
cover today."

643
01:08:47,828 --> 01:08:52,574
"The night is dark and
the morning is far away"

644
01:08:52,885 --> 01:08:56,509
"There is only destruction
on these roads."

645
01:09:07,303 --> 01:09:15,303
"There is no use of all these
cries of mine here & there."

646
01:09:16,765 --> 01:09:24,765
"There is no use of all these
cries of mine here & there."

647
01:09:26,442 --> 01:09:31,144
"I am in my tender age
& the journey is lonely"

648
01:09:31,224 --> 01:09:35,394
"Nobody will be there to
accompany me"

649
01:09:35,835 --> 01:09:40,228
"The night is dark and
the morning is far away"

650
01:09:40,392 --> 01:09:45,002
"There is only destruction
all over."

651
01:09:45,356 --> 01:09:49,750
"There is only destruction
all over."

652
01:09:50,157 --> 01:09:53,564
"There is only destruction
all over."

653
01:10:10,853 --> 01:10:18,853
Daddy, Mummy, Sister he has come

654
01:10:19,579 --> 01:10:21,776
Neelu! Neelu!

655
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:36,030
It goes on everyday. She keeps
looking at the road whole day

656
01:10:36,384 --> 01:10:42,540
Suddenly she comes down,
saying he has come

657
01:10:43,146 --> 01:10:44,641
But he never comes

658
01:10:52,652 --> 01:10:54,027
Neelu!

659
01:10:54,107 --> 01:10:57,210
Sister! Mother! Mother!

660
01:10:58,006 --> 01:10:59,355
Dear!

661
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,660
- But who is he?
- Don't know father

662
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:14,934
Nilu has kept it a secret.

663
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:18,789
She keeps looking
at the road the whole day.

664
01:11:19,163 --> 01:11:20,341
Nobody knows his name.

665
01:11:20,702 --> 01:11:24,615
Please give a try, otherwise Nilu
will become mad.

666
01:11:34,645 --> 01:11:37,075
Neelu! Neelu!

667
01:11:39,133 --> 01:11:41,131
I have never kept anything
secret from you.

668
01:11:41,546 --> 01:11:46,147
Why don't you tell me
about him, Nilu?

669
01:11:50,912 --> 01:11:54,839
- How would I tell you?
- Why, am I not your sister?

670
01:11:55,574 --> 01:11:58,395
If I don't understand your grief,
who else will?

671
01:11:59,570 --> 01:12:01,154
You will not be able to
understand it.

672
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:05,898
My grief is like that only

673
01:12:14,609 --> 01:12:16,910
Hello, Dr Kailash speaking.

674
01:12:17,982 --> 01:12:19,807
Hello! Hello! Hello!

675
01:12:20,066 --> 01:12:28,066
Dr. Kailash, it's Dr Yusuf speaking.
If you come, it'll be good.

676
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:31,777
Speak little loudly please.

677
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:36,537
It's almost six months since
Raj came here.

678
01:12:38,107 --> 01:12:40,762
Yes, right! I have checked up again.

679
01:12:40,842 --> 01:12:42,483
I have the new x-ray report.

680
01:12:42,907 --> 01:12:48,351
What would I do by going there?
Tell him the decision of death?

681
01:12:48,605 --> 01:12:51,157
Whatever be his fate,
let his lung decide.

682
01:12:51,702 --> 01:12:54,199
What's the use...
of troubling your lungs.

683
01:12:54,374 --> 01:12:55,905
That's good. Fine.

684
01:13:00,194 --> 01:13:04,026
Excuse me, I'll have to leave for
Sanatorium urgently...

685
01:13:05,254 --> 01:13:07,614
as I will finalise about my
friend's life or death today.

686
01:13:07,814 --> 01:13:10,993
But my daughter is also almost
in death bed.

687
01:13:11,213 --> 01:13:13,244
Please check her at first, then leave.

688
01:13:15,814 --> 01:13:19,006
Nothing has happened to me

689
01:13:19,086 --> 01:13:21,126
Nothing has happened to me
- You will be fine, dear!

690
01:13:22,456 --> 01:13:25,777
Why are you so much worried?
Nothing has happened to me

691
01:13:55,124 --> 01:14:03,124
"Come now, as my heart
is calling out to you"

692
01:14:05,856 --> 01:14:10,077
"Grief has also got defeated
by my tears."

693
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:15,103
"My love should not earn a bad name.
Please come now"

694
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:19,470
"As my heart
is calling out to you"

695
01:14:19,919 --> 01:14:24,071
"Grief has also got defeated
by my tears."

696
01:14:24,512 --> 01:14:29,451
"My love should not earn a bad name.
Please come now"

697
01:14:43,168 --> 01:14:47,626
"Death has started coming
towards me"

698
01:14:47,795 --> 01:14:52,276
"And life has started going
towards you"

699
01:14:52,356 --> 01:15:00,356
"Your separation is causing
me a lot of pain"

700
01:15:01,616 --> 01:15:06,310
"My eyes are pining to see you"

701
01:15:06,728 --> 01:15:12,385
"Come now, as my heart is
calling out to you"

702
01:15:13,025 --> 01:15:17,254
"Grief has also got defeated
by my tears."

703
01:15:17,626 --> 01:15:22,184
"My love should not earn a bad name.
Please come now"

704
01:15:24,614 --> 01:15:28,514
"My heart is now getting scared"

705
01:15:31,585 --> 01:15:35,486
"My heart is now getting scared"

706
01:15:36,212 --> 01:15:44,212
"Come at least in my
dreams to meet me"

707
01:15:45,794 --> 01:15:51,398
"Come now, as my heart
is calling out to you"

708
01:15:52,090 --> 01:15:56,362
"Grief has also got defeated
by my tears."

709
01:15:56,596 --> 01:16:01,768
"My love should not earn a bad name.
Please come now"

710
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:23,017
"Have a look at my sickness,
and see me if possible."

711
01:16:24,082 --> 01:16:32,082
"You may not have seen
this condition where..."

712
01:16:33,173 --> 01:16:37,921
"One loses his life gradually"

713
01:16:38,267 --> 01:16:44,443
"Come now, as my heart
is calling out to you"

714
01:16:44,523 --> 01:16:48,689
"Grief has also got defeated
by my tears."

715
01:16:49,131 --> 01:16:55,598
"My love should not earn a bad name.
Please come now"

716
01:17:03,313 --> 01:17:04,437
Neelu!

717
01:17:05,916 --> 01:17:07,162
Neelu!

718
01:17:07,413 --> 01:17:10,162
What has happened to you, Nilu

719
01:17:10,362 --> 01:17:13,369
Nothing has happened to me

720
01:17:13,727 --> 01:17:18,978
Look at me, I am your mother.
Don't hide anything from me

721
01:17:19,142 --> 01:17:20,656
I am not lying.

722
01:17:20,736 --> 01:17:23,994
I am ready to be a beggar for
your sake. Tell me who he is

723
01:17:24,074 --> 01:17:27,096
I will beg to him to
have mercy on you

724
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:29,718
My dear, just tell me who he is!

725
01:17:31,250 --> 01:17:32,417
Tell me.

726
01:17:32,772 --> 01:17:35,918
I have never spoken to
anyone about him

727
01:17:36,871 --> 01:17:37,900
He is...

728
01:17:38,272 --> 01:17:39,733
- Yes, dear...
- Neelu!

729
01:17:41,896 --> 01:17:43,271
What's the name?

730
01:17:47,016 --> 01:17:55,016
Please tell me who he is
- He is no one

731
01:17:59,825 --> 01:18:02,651
Have you seen this?
She will become mad

732
01:18:18,196 --> 01:18:21,014
I think we should arrange
for Nilu's marriage

733
01:18:21,353 --> 01:18:22,832
What will happen from that?

734
01:18:23,353 --> 01:18:27,280
- I think she will be more despaired!
- New life heals old wounds

735
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:30,695
Woman forgets all the old grief
after few months of marriage

736
01:18:30,775 --> 01:18:34,146
What will people say, if the
younger gets married...

737
01:18:34,353 --> 01:18:36,812
- earlier than the elder?
- Which people?

738
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:40,536
Only Raj Bahadur. And he told
that he has no objection

739
01:18:40,944 --> 01:18:44,992
He says he'll wait & Raj's health
is also not well these days.

740
01:18:45,511 --> 01:18:46,959
Ask Nilu about it first

741
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,320
I'll make her agree. I request
you not to delay.

742
01:18:51,150 --> 01:18:55,379
The X-ray is in front of you.
Raj's other lung is also affected

743
01:18:56,071 --> 01:18:58,822
And the gap between his life and
death has become narrow

744
01:18:59,704 --> 01:19:02,194
Is it the final decision?
Is there no hope?

745
01:19:03,189 --> 01:19:04,529
It's not possible, Kailash!

746
01:19:04,711 --> 01:19:06,241
You know best, as you are
also a doctor

747
01:19:07,591 --> 01:19:12,235
What's the use of my qualification
if it can't save my friend's life?

748
01:19:14,077 --> 01:19:16,256
And what's the
use of the progress of science...

749
01:19:16,948 --> 01:19:18,748
if it can't remove some dust
from the lungs

750
01:19:18,808 --> 01:19:24,757
The battle is still going on in
laboratories in every corner of the world.

751
01:19:25,518 --> 01:19:27,854
And some hopes are seen.

752
01:19:27,934 --> 01:19:31,054
In a few years with the progress of
science, the disease will not be...

753
01:19:31,676 --> 01:19:34,667
so dangerous and the patients
will be able to remain alive.

754
01:19:34,963 --> 01:19:39,383
- But in how many years?
- As per the renowned doctors...

755
01:19:39,463 --> 01:19:45,965
- It'll take 8 to 10 years.
- How long will Raj be alive in this condition?

756
01:19:46,959 --> 01:19:48,965
Well he is not going
to live that longer!

757
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:54,847
He won't be alive for more than
two years. I am helpless, Kailash.

758
01:19:54,927 --> 01:19:56,282
Nor can the science!

759
01:20:21,676 --> 01:20:24,305
- Hello, Raj.
- Hello, Kailash.

760
01:20:31,155 --> 01:20:34,115
So how far have you walked today
- Don't try to deviate.

761
01:20:34,701 --> 01:20:36,768
I want to know how long
will I be alive?

762
01:20:38,766 --> 01:20:41,019
Your other lung is also
affected, Raj

763
01:20:59,272 --> 01:21:04,567
What a joke you played, Kailash
You brought the bouquet of...

764
01:21:04,647 --> 01:21:06,808
those flowers which I wanted
to place in someone's hair.

765
01:21:06,832 --> 01:21:09,885
I will try my best to give you
the best of comforts...

766
01:21:10,109 --> 01:21:11,863
during your stay here.

767
01:21:13,578 --> 01:21:16,421
I have heard that
the lace below the...

768
01:21:16,501 --> 01:21:18,805
rope for hanging is made with
some cotton in the inner part...

769
01:21:18,829 --> 01:21:20,630
so that the person to be
hanged doesn't suffer in death.

770
01:21:20,654 --> 01:21:25,715
- I didn't want to mean that.
- I too didn't want to hurt you

771
01:21:27,260 --> 01:21:31,177
I may not have any power over
my death, but I can surely...

772
01:21:31,257 --> 01:21:35,249
decide where I will die. I am
not going to die in the hospital

773
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:39,375
I am not going to die in the hospital

774
01:21:57,986 --> 01:22:05,986
"The isolation of this evening
and sorrow caused by you."

775
01:22:06,954 --> 01:22:14,954
"The isolation of this evening
and sorrow caused by you."

776
01:22:15,897 --> 01:22:23,897
"The leaf also trembles a lot
when there is a strong wind."

777
01:22:25,012 --> 01:22:33,012
"The leaf also trembles a lot
when there is a strong wind."

778
01:22:34,042 --> 01:22:42,042
"The isolation of this evening
and sorrow caused by you."

779
01:22:53,969 --> 01:23:01,969
"The road by which you were
supposed to come..."

780
01:23:02,964 --> 01:23:10,964
"Is also its traces by now."

781
01:23:11,932 --> 01:23:19,932
"But you didn't come, although
many seasons have passed"

782
01:23:20,807 --> 01:23:28,807
"But you didn't come, although
many seasons have passed"

783
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:37,672
"The isolation of this evening
and sorrow caused by you."

784
01:23:58,365 --> 01:24:06,365
"I kept crying the whole night."

785
01:24:07,239 --> 01:24:15,239
"I have embraced your memory in
my heart and cried in the nights,"

786
01:24:15,983 --> 01:24:22,348
"Even the stars and the
moon have been sad..."

787
01:24:22,521 --> 01:24:24,380
"To see my condition"

788
01:24:24,752 --> 01:24:31,196
"Even the stars and the
moon have been sad..."

789
01:24:31,276 --> 01:24:33,186
"To see my condition"

790
01:24:33,266 --> 01:24:41,266
"The isolation of this evening
and sorrow caused by you."

791
01:24:41,837 --> 01:24:49,837
"The isolation of this evening
and sorrow caused by you."

792
01:24:59,193 --> 01:25:00,585
Will you go to Allahabad?

793
01:25:01,502 --> 01:25:06,691
Yes. As they say, one should cut
his coat according to the cloth

794
01:25:08,974 --> 01:25:11,691
I don't have much time with me,
& I've lot of pending works

795
01:25:11,863 --> 01:25:19,863
- Works?
- Yes, I have to do something for Nilu too

796
01:25:22,249 --> 01:25:26,403
- What will you do?
- I will do that what nobody has done in love

797
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:29,846
I'll create so much hatred for me
in that heart...

798
01:25:29,870 --> 01:25:32,436
for which I would have given
my life to secure a place for me.

799
01:25:34,961 --> 01:25:36,636
I'll snatch the away the
smiles from those lips.

800
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:39,353
For whose kisses I would have
risked my life thousand times...

801
01:25:41,301 --> 01:25:43,738
I'll do everything...

802
01:25:43,818 --> 01:25:47,517
Neelu will forget about me...

803
01:25:48,938 --> 01:25:51,325
So that my bad image
will be such that...

804
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:54,440
the people will tell her,
that Raj was a bad man

805
01:25:56,393 --> 01:25:57,916
Forget about that scoundrel!

806
01:26:05,329 --> 01:26:07,335
Please sing a song, Chandra

807
01:26:07,415 --> 01:26:08,743
A song which will...

808
01:26:08,823 --> 01:26:10,190
No, I'll not sing

809
01:26:10,270 --> 01:26:11,816
Oh come on, Chandra. Sing the song!

810
01:26:11,972 --> 01:26:13,555
I told you I am not going to sing!

811
01:26:17,836 --> 01:26:22,723
Kailash, you can only ask her to
sing a song now -I won't sing

812
01:26:23,017 --> 01:26:24,931
If you don't feel well after singing
then it'll be my responsibility,

813
01:26:24,955 --> 01:26:26,287
as I am your family doctor.

814
01:26:26,825 --> 01:26:30,008
- Please, sing the song!
- Excuse me, I will be just back.

815
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,205
Hello, Kailash.

816
01:26:35,285 --> 01:26:37,287
Raj, how come you are here?

817
01:26:37,367 --> 01:26:40,870
- Why not? I have got truckload of time!
- You should take rest now

818
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:45,221
How can I be at home when you
are having a party

819
01:26:45,938 --> 01:26:47,158
This party looks quite great!

820
01:26:49,295 --> 01:26:52,669
Silence, now Chandra will
sing a song

821
01:26:53,490 --> 01:26:59,147
- Who is that lady in black dress?
- Chandra, Nilu's sister

822
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:07,865
- Oh?
- What's the matter?

823
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:09,871
Nothing.

824
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:17,999
- Who is he?
- He is Raj. Don't you know him?

825
01:27:18,512 --> 01:27:19,512
Oh!

826
01:27:33,789 --> 01:27:37,875
"I heard about you a lot without
seeing from the Spring that..."

827
01:27:37,955 --> 01:27:41,915
"When I saw you, my heart
began to burst with happiness"

828
01:27:41,995 --> 01:27:45,963
"I heard about you a lot without
seeing from the Spring that..."

829
01:27:46,043 --> 01:27:49,820
"When I saw you, my heart
began to burst with happiness"

830
01:28:06,633 --> 01:28:14,633
"You were always hiding
from my sight"

831
01:28:14,858 --> 01:28:22,399
"But my heart told me that
it was only you"

832
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:30,711
"You coloured my hopes
with your eyes"

833
01:28:30,884 --> 01:28:34,811
"I heard about you a lot without
seeing from the Spring that..."

834
01:28:34,891 --> 01:28:39,334
"When I saw you, my heart
began to burst with happiness"

835
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:58,956
"Although I had refused his
love before..."

836
01:28:59,138 --> 01:29:06,610
"Now I have fallen in
love with him"

837
01:29:07,138 --> 01:29:14,965
"And I was bowled over!"

838
01:29:15,045 --> 01:29:18,926
"I heard about you a lot without
seeing from the Spring that..."

839
01:29:19,006 --> 01:29:22,775
"When I saw you, my heart
began to burst with happiness"

840
01:29:39,056 --> 01:29:46,802
"My heart did not bow to
anyone earlier"

841
01:29:47,096 --> 01:29:54,409
"But don't know what has
happened to me now"

842
01:29:54,777 --> 01:30:02,621
"Don't go away from me as I am
bursting with happiness"

843
01:30:02,701 --> 01:30:06,581
"I heard about you a lot without
seeing from the Spring that..."

844
01:30:06,661 --> 01:30:10,032
"When I saw you, my heart
began to burst with happiness"

845
01:30:17,756 --> 01:30:21,223
That was great.
So you are Chandra

846
01:30:22,305 --> 01:30:24,242
I couldn't recognize you.

847
01:30:24,588 --> 01:30:26,765
I thought of you to be
a different person.

848
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:30,898
Did you think, I will have four
legs & horns on my head

849
01:30:31,192 --> 01:30:33,528
Not like that
- But almost similar to that

850
01:30:34,801 --> 01:30:39,645
You had great fondness for the
life around those hills & lakes

851
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:41,748
I had to abandon that desolate
place as you couldn't leave...

852
01:30:41,772 --> 01:30:45,689
the brightness of the City.

853
01:30:46,632 --> 01:30:49,581
- How long'll you be here?
- Till you wish

854
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:02,348
So we have reached your home
- Should I leave now

855
01:31:05,617 --> 01:31:07,182
Will you come for dinner
tomorrow?

856
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:16,852
Please, you have to!

857
01:31:19,237 --> 01:31:24,541
How can I refuse your invitation.
I will surely come

858
01:31:24,621 --> 01:31:25,882
Okay, then I will leave now.

859
01:31:25,962 --> 01:31:27,257
Don't you forget!

860
01:31:29,299 --> 01:31:30,414
Bye, bye!

861
01:31:52,901 --> 01:31:54,172
Neelu!

862
01:31:56,049 --> 01:32:01,930
Do you know whom did I meet
today, Nilu -Whom?

863
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:05,793
I met Raj. I had refused him
without meeting him

864
01:32:07,418 --> 01:32:09,308
But he appeared to be a
completely different person

865
01:32:09,332 --> 01:32:13,958
How was he? - Very lovely
- Did he say anything?

866
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:17,056
Yes, he told me that he had to
leave behind the desolate place...

867
01:32:17,307 --> 01:32:20,161
as I was not ready to leave
the city. And he also told me...

868
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:24,249
that he will stay here as
long as I want him to.

869
01:32:24,771 --> 01:32:32,302
There must be some reason in it
- What reasons -Nothing

870
01:32:33,088 --> 01:32:40,235
Forgive me, as I tell anything in
this condition of mine

871
01:32:41,024 --> 01:32:45,420
I know. Even I shouldn't say
these things to you now.

872
01:32:45,678 --> 01:32:47,988
As I got back my Raj, you will
also get back your love someday.

873
01:32:48,012 --> 01:32:49,437
Forget it, sister!

874
01:32:51,291 --> 01:32:55,013
- He will never come.
- He will surely come

875
01:32:55,295 --> 01:32:58,339
I have invited Raj for dinner
tomorrow. He'll come here

876
01:33:08,397 --> 01:33:10,405
Where is mother?

877
01:33:12,730 --> 01:33:16,724
Nilu, set the table in a way that
father will sit here & mother there...

878
01:33:16,804 --> 01:33:20,910
you will sit here & he
will sit there. I & Raj will...

879
01:33:21,749 --> 01:33:25,935
sit opposite to each other so that
both of us see each other properly.

880
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:27,919
How is this arrangement?

881
01:33:28,165 --> 01:33:29,342
Very nice.

882
01:33:29,532 --> 01:33:31,261
Mr Raj has arrived, Madam

883
01:33:37,773 --> 01:33:44,632
Here you are
- How can I refuse your invitation?

884
01:33:45,706 --> 01:33:47,652
Let me introduce you
to my younger sister.

885
01:33:47,961 --> 01:33:51,140
Meet my sister, Nilu
- Nice meeting you

886
01:33:51,733 --> 01:33:56,623
You know him already
- Seems, I have met you earlier also

887
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:01,498
That must be your illusion.
You may have seen her in dream

888
01:34:03,048 --> 01:34:05,303
It is possible, as I dream a lot

889
01:34:07,153 --> 01:34:10,943
Your sister got upset. She might
not have liked my coming here

890
01:34:12,035 --> 01:34:17,753
It's not like that. Nilu had fallen
in love with a guy, who left her

891
01:34:18,611 --> 01:34:20,920
Neelu used to love someone.

892
01:34:21,508 --> 01:34:25,935
Since then she neither speaks
well nor laughs

893
01:34:27,968 --> 01:34:33,315
- Who was he?
- Don't know, as she never takes his name

894
01:34:35,276 --> 01:34:40,736
Sorry, as I hurt her wounds
- That's OK, as you didn't know

895
01:34:41,841 --> 01:34:43,968
Yeah, how would I?

896
01:34:44,429 --> 01:34:45,549
How are you Raj

897
01:34:45,629 --> 01:34:47,521
- Greetings!
- Greetings, dear! Bless you.

898
01:34:47,601 --> 01:34:48,801
- Hello, Kailash.
- Hello, Raj.

899
01:34:48,968 --> 01:34:50,170
How is Mr. Rajbahadur?

900
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,747
- He is fine. So how are you, sir?
- I am fine, dear.

901
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:55,273
Please have a seat

902
01:34:56,043 --> 01:34:58,407
I'll ask my mother to
serve the dinner.

903
01:34:58,662 --> 01:35:02,509
What's the hurry?
Give him some juice first -OK

904
01:35:02,962 --> 01:35:05,020
Okay. So Raj,
I hope you are doing fine?

905
01:35:05,344 --> 01:35:07,140
How is your construction
job going on?

906
01:35:07,554 --> 01:35:10,737
The workload is increasing day by day

907
01:35:10,961 --> 01:35:14,066
Then it's good for Mr Rajbahadur, as
he will earn a lot of wealth from that

908
01:35:14,146 --> 01:35:15,389
- Isn't it, Kailash?
- Right.

909
01:35:16,419 --> 01:35:17,906
Right.

910
01:35:18,270 --> 01:35:22,885
You didn't have anything, Raj
- No, I had enough

911
01:35:23,191 --> 01:35:27,201
Kailash, let's go and sit in the
drawing room. You sit here

912
01:35:31,604 --> 01:35:35,113
Why don't you sit here too?
We want to know each other well.

913
01:35:36,686 --> 01:35:41,359
As you are Chandra's sister
Please have a seat -Yes, Nilu

914
01:35:43,990 --> 01:35:46,955
I had almost forgotten by
staying in the forest for so long...

915
01:35:47,035 --> 01:35:53,591
what is it to sit amidst people.
And how eyes speak with others.

916
01:35:53,975 --> 01:35:59,022
- You seem to be a poet.
- I can even say about one's...

917
01:35:59,203 --> 01:36:01,113
heart by reading the hand.

918
01:36:01,193 --> 01:36:04,770
- Give me your hand.
- Leave my hand.

919
01:36:05,188 --> 01:36:06,650
Please read her palm!

920
01:36:14,345 --> 01:36:17,476
This is a nice hand. You will
have all the comforts in life

921
01:36:19,007 --> 01:36:20,523
This is your heart line. The man
with whom you are in love...

922
01:36:20,547 --> 01:36:22,747
- I don't like these kinds of pranks.
- I am not joking.

923
01:36:23,461 --> 01:36:27,534
The man with whom
you are in love is a fraud.

924
01:36:28,555 --> 01:36:30,333
I don't like this joke.

925
01:36:30,721 --> 01:36:33,515
Let it be!
Now have a look at my hand.

926
01:36:37,610 --> 01:36:41,448
How can I see that hand, as it
has my fate written on it

927
01:36:43,993 --> 01:36:46,043
- Oh I forgot it totally!
- Neelu!

928
01:36:46,346 --> 01:36:47,906
That's why your health
is deteriorating.

929
01:36:50,220 --> 01:36:51,319
- Listen, Kailash.
- Yes.

930
01:36:51,399 --> 01:36:52,445
Kailash, what do you
think about that tonic?

931
01:36:52,469 --> 01:36:53,850
Nilu, take this betel-leaf to
your brother-in-law

932
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:55,751
Well, I must say it's efficient!

933
01:36:56,832 --> 01:37:00,985
Why are you taking the trouble,
I'm right here

934
01:37:03,284 --> 01:37:05,482
Why are you crying?

935
01:37:06,867 --> 01:37:14,422
Nilu, are you crying as your
sister will leave you?

936
01:37:14,502 --> 01:37:16,378
I am going to take you
also with me

937
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:21,108
Why will she go with you? She will go
to her own house after her marriage.

938
01:37:22,501 --> 01:37:26,098
I'll have great fun then.
I'll sing & dance

939
01:37:26,274 --> 01:37:31,088
But on this happy occasion,
Nilu should sing a song today

940
01:37:31,797 --> 01:37:39,512
- Will you sing?
- No Please sing a song -No

941
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:43,023
You told me that you
will sing and dance!

942
01:37:43,204 --> 01:37:44,204
Come on, sing it now!

943
01:37:44,398 --> 01:37:46,785
Sister, today, I...

944
01:37:48,688 --> 01:37:53,468
She will not sing today
- No, she will sing

945
01:37:58,054 --> 01:38:00,415
How can I not sing on this
good day?

946
01:38:10,827 --> 01:38:12,868
Mother

947
01:38:13,768 --> 01:38:18,265
The day on which the house will
be filled with sound of Shehnai...

948
01:38:18,923 --> 01:38:22,469
and decoration, and my sister's
hand coloured with henna.

949
01:38:23,369 --> 01:38:27,814
Your wishes will be fulfilled!
Your dreams will come true!

950
01:38:28,834 --> 01:38:31,377
And that day!

951
01:38:54,338 --> 01:39:02,338
"When the King's marriage
procession will be here and..."

952
01:39:04,171 --> 01:39:10,040
"The night will be colourful,
I will dance merrily."

953
01:39:11,280 --> 01:39:15,700
"I will dance merrily."

954
01:39:15,780 --> 01:39:18,658
"When the King's marriage
procession will be here and..."

955
01:39:18,738 --> 01:39:24,936
"The night will be colourful, I
will dance merrily."

956
01:39:25,827 --> 01:39:29,952
"I will dance merrily."

957
01:39:30,032 --> 01:39:33,464
"When the King's marriage
procession will be here and..."

958
01:39:52,565 --> 01:40:00,565
"King's forehead will have 'tilak'
& queen's will have vermilion"

959
01:40:01,848 --> 01:40:05,428
"Queen's will have vermilion."

960
01:40:06,604 --> 01:40:14,604
"I will also fulfil my desire"

961
01:40:20,669 --> 01:40:28,669
"By applying henna in my hands
and dance merrily with my friends"

962
01:40:30,578 --> 01:40:34,617
"I will dance merrily."

963
01:40:34,697 --> 01:40:37,610
"When the King's marriage
procession will be here and..."

964
01:40:47,678 --> 01:40:55,366
"The queen & king will go to
another place in a palanquin"

965
01:40:57,019 --> 01:41:04,379
"The queen & king will go to
another place in a palanquin"

966
01:41:06,403 --> 01:41:14,403
"Whenever I remember them, their
memory will pierce the heart"

967
01:41:20,311 --> 01:41:28,311
"There will be tear in my eyes
and I'll dance alone like a mad"

968
01:41:29,952 --> 01:41:33,826
"I'll dance alone like a mad"

969
01:41:34,198 --> 01:41:36,983
When the King's marriage
procession will be here and...

970
01:41:37,063 --> 01:41:42,830
the night will be colourful,
I will dance merrily.

971
01:41:43,893 --> 01:41:47,362
"I will dance merrily."

972
01:41:47,993 --> 01:41:51,124
"When the King's marriage
procession will be here and..."

973
01:41:51,925 --> 01:41:54,044
Mad girl, What is there to cry
so much now?

974
01:41:57,195 --> 01:41:58,195
Great.

975
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:05,940
Your sister really sings well.
I'll leave now.

976
01:42:06,561 --> 01:42:09,155
- Are you leaving?
- Yes, I think it's late.

977
01:42:09,509 --> 01:42:12,801
Will you come to the Dam
tomorrow? Please bring Nilu too

978
01:42:12,881 --> 01:42:14,619
Don't forget.
Good bye now

979
01:42:14,699 --> 01:42:16,559
- Kailash, shall we?
- Let's go. - Come.

980
01:42:16,724 --> 01:42:19,456
- Bye. Please don't bother!
- That's fine. Please, this way!

981
01:42:19,738 --> 01:42:21,679
Give my greetings to
Mr. Raj Bahadur

982
01:42:21,759 --> 01:42:22,759
Sure.

983
01:47:25,240 --> 01:47:27,988
Be careful, otherwise you'll slip
- Not now

984
01:47:48,619 --> 01:47:51,136
Neelu! Wait, Neelu!

985
01:48:15,065 --> 01:48:20,159
Dada, please prepare the tea.
Nilu & Chandra will arrive soon.

986
01:48:24,743 --> 01:48:26,646
How is your health now?

987
01:48:28,037 --> 01:48:32,845
Alright. The day I am waiting
for seems to be drifting away

988
01:48:33,279 --> 01:48:36,367
Don't speak like this, son.
Everything will be alright

989
01:48:44,643 --> 01:48:45,643
You!

990
01:48:49,911 --> 01:48:51,625
But you had gone for
swimming in the lake

991
01:48:52,811 --> 01:48:54,496
I found an excuse.

992
01:48:55,603 --> 01:48:57,902
I told my sister that
I've forgotten something here.

993
01:48:59,591 --> 01:49:01,952
You didn't do right by telling a lie

994
01:49:03,898 --> 01:49:05,351
And what about your acts?

995
01:49:06,441 --> 01:49:07,842
What am I doing?

996
01:49:09,208 --> 01:49:12,780
You told me earlier that you
can't live without me.

997
01:49:14,388 --> 01:49:16,490
Now you are playing the same
game with my sister

998
01:49:19,828 --> 01:49:23,476
You also had written letters to
me in Chandra's name

999
01:49:23,659 --> 01:49:28,207
I only used her name. But the
thoughts & feelings were mine

1000
01:49:30,545 --> 01:49:32,967
You could find my
soul amidst those words!

1001
01:49:33,847 --> 01:49:36,978
What has happened to you? Why
have you changed like this?

1002
01:49:37,922 --> 01:49:45,577
- What's the secret? - Secret?
- Why have you put on this mask?

1003
01:49:45,878 --> 01:49:50,017
I am not wearing any mask.
I never fell in love with you.

1004
01:49:50,097 --> 01:49:52,934
- You are telling me a lie.
- You don't want to know the truth

1005
01:49:53,648 --> 01:49:55,518
So these answers don't mean anything!

1006
01:49:55,598 --> 01:50:03,119
The whole world lives on trust.

1007
01:50:04,071 --> 01:50:05,779
Trust on humanity.

1008
01:50:06,170 --> 01:50:13,109
Reason is, If you become false,
there is nothing like truth...

1009
01:50:13,509 --> 01:50:15,492
God and faith in the world.

1010
01:50:15,572 --> 01:50:17,533
Go with your foolish talks to
some other place.

1011
01:50:18,537 --> 01:50:21,672
There is no place for truth,
God & faith in my life.

1012
01:50:22,991 --> 01:50:25,506
- Where is Mr. Raj?
- There in the room

1013
01:50:28,688 --> 01:50:32,544
Go out from here, else what
will Chandra think of us?

1014
01:50:32,624 --> 01:50:35,495
Let her come here.
Sister come here.

1015
01:50:38,569 --> 01:50:44,730
- Neelu, you are here?
- Yes, I am here. I want a decision. - What?

1016
01:50:44,810 --> 01:50:45,810
Yes.

1017
01:50:46,256 --> 01:50:49,716
I have to ask him whether he
loves me or you -What?

1018
01:50:50,742 --> 01:50:52,623
Mr. Raj, what's going on here?

1019
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:56,484
The fraud he was mentioning
about while seeing my hand...

1020
01:50:56,564 --> 01:51:00,304
- was only himself.
- Is it true? - Yes

1021
01:51:01,736 --> 01:51:04,680
Ask her whom she had written
letters in your name

1022
01:51:05,662 --> 01:51:08,079
And then she met me with your name!

1023
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:10,544
- Her name is not Chandra!
- Neelu!

1024
01:51:11,154 --> 01:51:14,927
Let's forget about that!
Now since we are engaged...

1025
01:51:15,255 --> 01:51:18,938
and even when Neelu knows about this
she is still trying to instigate me!

1026
01:51:19,241 --> 01:51:20,341
Ask her...

1027
01:51:20,421 --> 01:51:23,223
why she wants to take the vermillion
from her sister's forehead to her.

1028
01:51:23,247 --> 01:51:26,626
And if she claims otherwise, then
ask her what is she doing in my room?

1029
01:51:27,087 --> 01:51:28,579
Come on, Neelu, answer me!

1030
01:51:29,066 --> 01:51:34,049
This is false.
I swear by your name - Leave me

1031
01:51:34,763 --> 01:51:36,385
Sister! Sister!

1032
01:52:11,249 --> 01:52:17,591
Raj, how long will you give
pains to Nilu like this?

1033
01:52:20,006 --> 01:52:22,293
This is not enough.

1034
01:52:22,373 --> 01:52:26,154
Do you think I enjoy what I do?

1035
01:52:27,471 --> 01:52:31,713
My heart squirms in anguish
every time I hurt her!

1036
01:52:32,725 --> 01:52:40,725
But Kailash, I want her to condemn me!
I want to hurt her even more!

1037
01:52:42,303 --> 01:52:47,151
So that she will forget about me!
And she will forget about my love!

1038
01:52:47,658 --> 01:52:49,702
Will it happen?

1039
01:52:51,088 --> 01:52:53,402
I will make it happen, Kailash!

1040
01:52:55,395 --> 01:52:58,621
I will erase my memories
from her heart before I'll die!

1041
01:52:59,972 --> 01:53:05,986
I will try my best to do that so that
she gets married to a good person.

1042
01:53:07,431 --> 01:53:09,777
With whom she can
spend her life happily!

1043
01:53:15,077 --> 01:53:21,077
- Will you marry her, Kailash?
- Me? Are you mad?

1044
01:53:21,799 --> 01:53:25,464
You know the love in her heart. You can
only understand the pain in her heart.

1045
01:53:26,004 --> 01:53:27,258
What will happen by this?

1046
01:53:28,026 --> 01:53:30,459
Kailash,
at least I will die in peace.

1047
01:53:31,291 --> 01:53:36,622
Any other person will
give more pains to her.

1048
01:53:39,065 --> 01:53:41,378
She has already suffered a lot.

1049
01:53:45,130 --> 01:53:47,073
Do you know what you
are asking from me?

1050
01:53:55,376 --> 01:54:00,675
I know. I am asking for a
cream to heal Nilu's wounds

1051
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:04,051
And the last happiness for me.

1052
01:54:06,608 --> 01:54:10,298
Will you give it to me?

1053
01:54:12,036 --> 01:54:15,058
Will you give it to me?

1054
01:54:24,671 --> 01:54:28,874
- Are you happy now?
- Yes. And whatever happened was good.

1055
01:54:29,109 --> 01:54:33,618
- I liked him from start.
- Whose marriage are you talking about?

1056
01:54:34,036 --> 01:54:37,773
- Nilu's marriage, with Doctor Kailash.
- Nilu has agreed

1057
01:54:38,102 --> 01:54:40,610
Dr. Kailash has just left. Yes!

1058
01:54:55,961 --> 01:54:56,961
Is it true, Nilu?

1059
01:54:59,260 --> 01:55:00,988
Yes - But why?

1060
01:55:03,922 --> 01:55:07,831
Why? Can't I get married?

1061
01:55:10,968 --> 01:55:18,968
- Is it because of me?
- No, I gave you pain. Raj was right.

1062
01:55:21,042 --> 01:55:24,060
I wanted to snatch the vermillion
from your forehead for me

1063
01:55:25,539 --> 01:55:27,464
Please forgive me, sister

1064
01:55:30,072 --> 01:55:33,606
Let me go, I'll have to go.

1065
01:55:33,686 --> 01:55:41,686
- No, you can't go.
- But my only son is in such bad health and...

1066
01:55:45,400 --> 01:55:49,390
You are not in a position
to go out now...

1067
01:55:50,854 --> 01:55:54,525
I have called for Dr. Joseph, there
will not be any lack in his care.

1068
01:55:55,087 --> 01:55:58,380
But if I want to go
- You can't travel in this health

1069
01:55:59,592 --> 01:56:02,211
If Raj becomes alright,
Dr. Joseph will bring him here

1070
01:56:04,888 --> 01:56:09,746
- I wanted to go there, but...
- I know

1071
01:56:09,826 --> 01:56:17,365
Because you are getting married
to Nilu. But you were his friend.

1072
01:56:19,044 --> 01:56:21,130
Couldn't you even wait
for some days?

1073
01:56:21,448 --> 01:56:24,008
Raj was stubborn that I should
marry her while he is still alive.

1074
01:56:24,254 --> 01:56:32,254
I was helpless. But I was not
compelled by my heart.

1075
01:56:34,396 --> 01:56:36,850
- Kailash!
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:56:38,677 --> 01:56:42,893
Please forgive me. I thought it
the other way.

1077
01:56:45,002 --> 01:56:50,619
Even the world will think it the
other way. But I don't care.

1078
01:56:51,888 --> 01:56:53,888
I am just worried about Raj.

1079
01:56:55,704 --> 01:56:57,807
What Raj has done, can't be
done by anyone else

1080
01:56:58,206 --> 01:57:02,858
Even nobody can even what
you have done.

1081
01:57:07,108 --> 01:57:11,523
Raj, my son

1082
01:57:32,677 --> 01:57:35,942
I ran away from you from the
Sanatorium...

1083
01:57:36,446 --> 01:57:38,272
but you reached here too.

1084
01:57:39,347 --> 01:57:41,683
I will ask Kailash
about this when I can meet him.

1085
01:57:56,926 --> 01:58:01,132
Purandada! Purandada!

1086
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:04,478
Yes, dear?

1087
01:58:04,558 --> 01:58:07,188
Purandada, what music is this?

1088
01:58:07,434 --> 01:58:09,034
Two labour people are getting
married.

1089
01:58:09,434 --> 01:58:13,147
They came here seeking your blessings.
I told them to go away

1090
01:58:13,227 --> 01:58:15,676
No, I'll meet them. Please go
and call them back

1091
01:58:32,905 --> 01:58:40,887
May you have all the happiness
of the world & you live long!

1092
01:58:56,030 --> 01:58:58,832
- What's the date today?
- 11th December.

1093
01:59:05,184 --> 01:59:13,184
Only two days are left!
I've to reach Riwa as soon.

1094
01:59:17,312 --> 01:59:19,831
I've to reach Riwa as soon.

1095
01:59:20,436 --> 01:59:22,523
Why do you want to go to Riwa?

1096
01:59:26,014 --> 01:59:29,920
Nilu is getting married the day
after tomorrow.

1097
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:35,776
This rascal Kailash is also old-fashioned
He told me that marriage...

1098
01:59:35,856 --> 01:59:38,054
should take place in the
house of his forefathers.

1099
01:59:40,912 --> 01:59:42,807
Will you take me to Riwa,
please?

1100
01:59:42,887 --> 01:59:48,382
You can't travel in this health,
Raj -I know

1101
01:59:53,730 --> 01:59:58,676
I told you in the Sanatorium also
that my death...

1102
01:59:59,681 --> 02:00:04,784
may not be in my hands, but I can
at least decide where I will die.

1103
02:00:09,076 --> 02:00:10,881
Purandada!

1104
02:00:14,647 --> 02:00:19,638
Please post this letter,
Purandada. That time has come

1105
02:00:21,519 --> 02:00:23,843
Post this letter.

1106
02:00:42,556 --> 02:00:50,556
"If you can, come down to see
this sick sorrow man of yours"

1107
02:00:59,865 --> 02:01:05,216
"You may not have seen..."

1108
02:01:12,611 --> 02:01:20,168
"You may not have seen,
how the final breath goes out..."

1109
02:01:20,248 --> 02:01:23,901
"From one's body"

1110
02:01:24,816 --> 02:01:32,816
"Come, as my heart is calling
out to you..."

1111
02:01:34,060 --> 02:01:42,060
"Even sorrow got defeated by my cries.
My love should not get a bad name"

1112
02:01:44,774 --> 02:01:52,774
"My heart is getting scared."

1113
02:01:56,717 --> 02:01:59,758
- Have we reached Satna?
- Not yet

1114
02:02:01,706 --> 02:02:04,679
"At least come to meet
me in my dreams"

1115
02:02:04,759 --> 02:02:10,653
I'll surely come to meet you, Nilu
as I had promised to you

1116
02:02:13,478 --> 02:02:16,310
This is such a strange race!

1117
02:02:18,158 --> 02:02:24,451
I am coming to you
and death is after me

1118
02:02:26,721 --> 02:02:28,494
Let's see who reaches first

1119
02:02:39,668 --> 02:02:41,796
You should have at least sent a
letter to Raj's father

1120
02:02:41,876 --> 02:02:47,729
But he is also sick.
Will he reach home -May be!

1121
02:02:55,764 --> 02:03:00,449
Don't be worried, Purandada.
I'll not die in the train

1122
02:03:24,723 --> 02:03:27,437
Take this to bride. Chandra,
what are you doing here? Come on!

1123
02:03:27,909 --> 02:03:31,008
I didn't want to put the mark of
my funeral ash in Nilu's forehead

1124
02:03:31,513 --> 02:03:37,718
So I made all these drama. This
secret is only known to 3 people

1125
02:03:38,129 --> 02:03:39,340
This was my secret.

1126
02:03:39,901 --> 02:03:43,249
Now I have revealed to you also.
Promise me that you'll never...

1127
02:03:43,329 --> 02:03:47,746
tell Nilu the truth. Tell her
always that I was a bad man

1128
02:03:48,238 --> 02:03:49,789
Pour water in his memory.

1129
02:04:47,731 --> 02:04:49,137
Will you take me to Riva?

1130
02:04:54,110 --> 02:04:58,258
Will you take me to Riwa?

1131
02:04:58,435 --> 02:04:59,435
At this hour?

1132
02:05:01,105 --> 02:05:06,616
- You seem to be mad.
- Why? Wild animals can come...

1133
02:05:07,570 --> 02:05:11,515
this way at night. Have
rest in the waiting room

1134
02:05:11,850 --> 02:05:14,608
I'll take you there in the morning
- I don't have that much time

1135
02:05:15,512 --> 02:05:19,431
- I'll pay a good fare.
- You'll pay the fare & God will give death

1136
02:05:21,721 --> 02:05:29,721
Death is coming after me. Let's
see who reaches first.

1137
02:05:31,342 --> 02:05:36,862
- Will you go?
- Yes, I'll go there thousand times for this money.

1138
02:05:49,753 --> 02:05:57,072
Please hurry up. I'll be grateful
to you, if I reach on time

1139
02:06:01,234 --> 02:06:02,564
Life!

1140
02:06:05,810 --> 02:06:13,810
I have lived 32 years. I'm asking
just 1 more night from you, Life

1141
02:06:20,117 --> 02:06:25,061
Seems to be mad. He shouldn't
ask the money back in Riwa

1142
02:06:25,488 --> 02:06:29,891
I'll not ask the money back
- You heard it, Sir

1143
02:06:32,674 --> 02:06:36,812
Please make this mad man
reach Riwa as soon

1144
02:06:39,741 --> 02:06:43,212
- I must go there!
- Okay, sir! I'll take you there! I will for sure!

1145
02:07:06,508 --> 02:07:12,699
"This life is very small &
your youth is also for few days"

1146
02:07:13,124 --> 02:07:17,644
"This is a story of
your sadness"

1147
02:07:21,471 --> 02:07:28,001
"This life is very small &
your youth is also for few days"

1148
02:07:28,081 --> 02:07:32,368
"This is a story of
your sadness"

1149
02:07:53,915 --> 02:07:58,145
"It is dark now in this
desolate place and..."

1150
02:07:58,225 --> 02:08:04,424
"You want to reach your
beloved's place"

1151
02:08:06,791 --> 02:08:11,072
"It is dark now in this
desolate place and..."

1152
02:08:11,246 --> 02:08:17,441
"You want to reach your
beloved's place"

1153
02:08:17,521 --> 02:08:24,035
"Don't hesitate or back down!"

1154
02:08:24,115 --> 02:08:30,505
"This life is very small &
your youth is also for few days"

1155
02:08:30,585 --> 02:08:34,869
"This is a story of
your sadness"

1156
02:08:39,093 --> 02:08:45,628
"This life is very small &
your youth is also for few days"

1157
02:08:45,708 --> 02:08:49,425
"This is a story of
your sadness"

1158
02:09:11,709 --> 02:09:17,484
"Lover's house is left behind
and eyes are also covered..."

1159
02:09:17,564 --> 02:09:22,237
"With darkness. And the
heart is also getting scared."

1160
02:09:24,547 --> 02:09:30,183
"Lover's house is left behind
and eyes are also covered..."

1161
02:09:30,263 --> 02:09:35,050
"With darkness. And the
heart is also getting scared."

1162
02:09:35,224 --> 02:09:41,637
"The treasure of heart starts
falling from the eyes"

1163
02:09:41,717 --> 02:09:48,173
"This life is very small &
your youth is also for few days"

1164
02:09:48,253 --> 02:09:52,654
"This is a story of
your sadness"

1165
02:09:56,387 --> 02:10:03,232
"This life is very small &
your youth is also for few days"

1166
02:10:03,312 --> 02:10:07,692
"This is a story of
your sadness"

1167
02:10:22,088 --> 02:10:26,627
Raj, are you alright?
I almost lost my breath

1168
02:10:27,285 --> 02:10:30,678
How come you all are here?
Nilu, I was coming to you myself

1169
02:10:31,188 --> 02:10:32,868
To congratulate you and Kailash.

1170
02:10:35,990 --> 02:10:41,937
What's this all, Kailash?

1171
02:10:44,462 --> 02:10:46,764
What have you done, Nilu?

1172
02:10:47,573 --> 02:10:50,288
She has done the same, what
every married women do.

1173
02:10:50,368 --> 02:10:55,432
Nilu is ignorant, but you all
know that, then

1174
02:10:56,118 --> 02:10:57,584
Kailash, you know everything.

1175
02:10:57,828 --> 02:11:00,317
Nilu also knows it now
- I couldn't keep it a secret.

1176
02:11:01,508 --> 02:11:02,824
But still you want to...

1177
02:11:03,863 --> 02:11:09,914
I didn't want to put my funeral's
ashes in your forehead, Nilu

1178
02:11:10,566 --> 02:11:13,663
If my service is successful, then
this burial ashes will...

1179
02:11:13,743 --> 02:11:15,418
turn out to be vermilion for me.

1180
02:11:16,609 --> 02:11:19,240
- I want your blessings, mother!
- Neelu!

1181
02:11:21,604 --> 02:11:22,716
- But?
- Yes Raj!

1182
02:11:23,796 --> 02:11:24,930
Kailash? How could?

1183
02:11:25,219 --> 02:11:28,467
1000 years ago, Savitri claimed
back her husband Satyavan...

1184
02:11:28,547 --> 02:11:32,545
from death. It's not impossible.
You may start living again.

1185
02:16:04,278 --> 02:16:08,353
Hail Lord Krishna! Hail Lord Krishna!

1186
02:16:22,503 --> 02:16:25,701
"Mother Yashoda,
your son Lord Krishna...

1187
02:16:25,781 --> 02:16:30,097
is very mischievous!
Look what did he do?"

1188
02:16:30,406 --> 02:16:35,069
"Mother Yashoda,
your son Lord Krishna...

1189
02:16:35,148 --> 02:16:38,149
is very mischievous!
Look what did he do?"

1190
02:16:38,230 --> 02:16:41,348
"Lord Krishna plays the
flute at the bank of Jamuna!"

1191
02:16:41,428 --> 02:16:44,482
"All morning, noon and night!"

1192
02:16:44,562 --> 02:16:47,647
"He plays amorously
with women when they...

1193
02:16:47,727 --> 02:16:50,717
go at the bank of
river to fetch water!"

1194
02:16:50,797 --> 02:16:55,294
"Mother Yashoda,
your son Lord Krishna...

1195
02:16:55,374 --> 02:16:58,310
is very mischievous!
Look what did he do?"

1196
02:16:58,389 --> 02:17:01,614
"He dallies with us all!"

1197
02:17:01,695 --> 02:17:04,449
"He holds our hand
and won't let us go!"

1198
02:17:04,529 --> 02:17:07,539
"He dallies with us all!"

1199
02:17:07,619 --> 02:17:10,587
"He holds our hand
and won't let us go!"

1200
02:17:10,666 --> 02:17:16,394
"Mother Yashoda, we pray to you,
to scold your dear son!

1201
02:17:16,475 --> 02:17:20,246
"Mother Yashoda,
your son Lord Krishna...

1202
02:17:20,325 --> 02:17:23,688
is very mischievous!
Look what did he do?"

1203
02:17:23,769 --> 02:17:27,176
"Mother Yashoda,
your son Lord Krishna...

1204
02:17:27,255 --> 02:17:29,891
is very mischievous!
Look what did he do?"

1205
02:17:29,972 --> 02:17:32,288
"Hail Lord Krishna and Radha!"

1206
02:17:32,368 --> 02:17:35,143
"Hail Lord Krishna and Radha!"

1207
02:17:35,223 --> 02:17:38,983
"Hail Lord Krishna and Radha!"
