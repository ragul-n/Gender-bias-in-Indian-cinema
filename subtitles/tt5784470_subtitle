1
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:50,112
(Leader.. Lead on five
to eight behind you)

2
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:19,270
"Long ago..Very, very long ago"

3
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:25,530
"There was a native place..
Ancient native place"

4
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:30,870
"The name of this native
place..Don't know what it is...!"

5
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,952
"The direction..lt was to the south"

6
00:04:14,148 --> 00:04:16,287
"Well known for backbiting"

7
00:04:17,014 --> 00:04:22,361
"Call..Just call, mother, the
eye balls bounced out!"

8
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:27,496
"The truth of this native
is,'Fantabulous!"

00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:13,249
"Come on whack, doesn't have
Whack, Om Shanthi, Shanthi"

10
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,280
"Wait..All is well"

11
00:05:16,573 --> 00:05:22,284
"Don't do..Politicks
How good is this native?"

12
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,611
"Super..Abbe"

13
00:05:51,168 --> 00:05:56,845
"Look..What a world it is"

14
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:02,840
"Thoughts..What a
thoughts..Marvellous!"

15
00:06:03,033 --> 00:06:07,913
"The courage in this
native..Kangaru..Lation!"

16
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:03,235
This is the tale of 'Perumal Desham'
which reaped gold from soil

17
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,395
The saltness of sweat,
which is most sweetest

18
00:07:06,524 --> 00:07:08,526
Those who believe like that,
the tale of 'Perumal Desham'

19
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:12,494
These people considers the toil in
soil is the most decent work

20
00:07:12,856 --> 00:07:14,426
Today, its a good day for them

21
00:07:16,422 --> 00:07:18,493

Kazchakal' (Through the window)

26
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:28,998
Was it this?

27
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:30,358
Silence..Don't talk
On splashing water"

28
00:07:30,486 --> 00:07:32,488
On an important person
at 'Perumalpuram'

29
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:34,530
We've prepared today's
special episode

30
00:07:34,886 --> 00:07:36,593
Come on walk

00:07:36,885 --> 00:07:39,491
Come on run
Brother, gone..Shucks!

32
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:42,923
Fellow, a Malayalee, who
doesn't mind TV camera?

33
00:07:43,452 --> 00:07:48,423
Only with com patriots intro, must
reach out to central character

34
00:07:52,283 --> 00:07:53,853
Fellow, where are you
looking and walking?

35
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,931
Look the tube light is broken
Sorry! What sorry after breaking it?

36
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:58,857
No, I was" That's because
Who are you?

37
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:00,951
You aren't seen here before
From the TV channel

38
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:04,488
So, tonight has got a topic to
discuss with five people in the news

39
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,594
Saying the tube light is broken
Not like that -Then?

40
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:08,291
Brother, as you are from this native-

41
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:11,294
-can you spend two
minutes for our channel?

42
00:08:11,481 --> 00:08:15,292
Get lost fellow! Its not that we
are jobless TV people like you!

43
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,960
We are all too busy with several
engagements, come on, go!

44
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:20,251
What is this thinking about?
Just zoom

45
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,481
What is it?
Brother, how handsome you are

46
00:08:22,646 --> 00:08:24,250
When looking through this camera

47
00:08:24,413 --> 00:08:28,019
As if like Hindi actorAmir Khan
sitting on top of jackfru it tree!

48
00:08:28,145 --> 00:08:29,146
True?
Yeah!

49
00:08:33,244 --> 00:08:35,918
That worked, you keep it focused

50
00:08:39,111 --> 00:08:40,612
I'll go only after taking
your statement

51
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:41,445
Just watch it, okay
Its okay

52
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,283
Come, come
Come to the top -Okay take

53
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,218
Greetings, welcome to the new
episode of 'Jalaka Kazchakal'

54
00:08:47,409 --> 00:08:49,252
Just record everything
Am I there in the frame?

55
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:51,888
Should climb the Jackfru it tree, no?
In stead of Jackfru it tree

56
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:54,284
I'll climb on the top of Qutub Minar!
Climb carefully

57
00:08:56,274 --> 00:08:58,117
Greetings
Greetings

58
00:08:58,274 --> 00:09:01,015
For the first time in the TV history
One which you haven't seen so far

59
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,586
While starting any program,
says for the first time in history

60
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:05,614
What newness is there?
There is newness

61
00:09:05,973 --> 00:09:07,281
What?
Usually at the news room

62
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,012
By putting two chairs, they lock
horns each other on a topic is it?

63
00:09:11,172 --> 00:09:13,914
Yeah - But here we sit on the
same branch and say the opinion

64
00:09:14,106 --> 00:09:15,083
Is there newness?
That is good very good

65
00:09:15,205 --> 00:09:17,913
For this festival held at 'Perumal
Desham' CM is also participating

66
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:20,247
Is CM coming?
No the chief minister 'CM'

67
00:09:20,405 --> 00:09:23,385
'CM', city media
The short form of this

68
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,107
Why? Didn't you like it?
'Perumal Desham' is very happy

69
00:09:26,237 --> 00:09:29,809
But brother, is not that happy
That is..l'll say that

70
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,276
From here to
there 6 kilometre radius-

71
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:34,574
- on all trees which are
on both sides of road

72
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:37,907
I've fixed colourful
illumination bulbs and tube lights

73
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:40,073
That is a good thing, no?
But the function is during day time

74
00:09:41,302 --> 00:09:44,441
One important question, on
hearing this name 'Perumal Desham'

75
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:46,011
It is some what a heavy name

76
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:49,081
How did this place get the
name 'Perumal Desham?'

77
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:51,237
Earlier didn't I ask whether
CM is coming?

78
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:54,404
Usually, those kind of people never
used to come here, that's the truth!

79
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:59,412
Two generations back, person who
ruled over here was Shekara Perumal

80
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,534
I'm an expatriate here, knows
only through word of mouth

81
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:06,210
He was a great giver and takes
up all issues of compatriots

82
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:09,345
So, like that for years Perumal
people were ruling this land

83
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:11,307
That is how this name 'Perumal
Desham' came to being

84
00:10:11,463 --> 00:10:13,534
Right now, this Shekara
Pilla's grandson

85
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:15,467
Another Perumal is ruling this native

86
00:10:24,229 --> 00:10:27,471
Lord Perumal should permit
us to end our relationship

87
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,933
So, which means you
can't jointly live together

88
00:10:31,095 --> 00:10:33,199
Only it its not finalised here, then
only we'll seek before court

89
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,000
Husband doubts the
wife and wife is not living -

90
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,074
- as per expectation of husband

91
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,171
In stead of living like this
its better to end the relationship

92
00:10:43,626 --> 00:10:46,799
For that, should require
my permission, very good

93
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,963
Man, right now what is your
crop? Is it rice or vegetable?

94
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,229
Both are there -Between the
rice plants does weeds come?

95
00:10:54,424 --> 00:10:57,462
Yeah - Does the pests come
and ruin it?

96
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,427
At that time do you pluck
out the weed or the rice plant?

97
00:11:01,623 --> 00:11:02,931
The weed!
Yeah

98
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,593
The weed, fellow when
there is a problem in life

99
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,434
Must pluck out and
throw out that problem

100
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,569
Notjust ruining
the life which is gained

101
00:11:10,355 --> 00:11:14,393
Do you know? My wife
Janaki when she was sick

102
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:16,932
Along with sorrow, I
had happiness also

103
00:11:17,321 --> 00:11:18,459
Why is it so?

104
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:22,063
To nurse her by sitting near
her and to love more

105
00:11:22,187 --> 00:11:23,962
I saw that as a chance
which was given by God

106
00:11:24,087 --> 00:11:27,591
What a family is, everything that
happens should increase love

107
00:11:28,286 --> 00:11:31,893
If what I have told is understood,
both of you go home

108
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:36,029
Why? Is it agreeable?
Agreeable

109
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,397
I wont agree it

110
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,424
Fellow, did you hear what the
boss said? He doesn't agree

111
00:11:41,585 --> 00:11:43,222
Who wants the permission of boss

112
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,328
All that is settled and
solved by Perumal, no?

113
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,986
Then why did you bring
us here by force?

114
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:50,824
Perumal, Perumal, stop it fellow!
No need boss

115
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,486
Fellow, not simply solving the
issue at Perumal's place

116
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:55,887
It should be solved here also
at our boss Pilla's place

117
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,050
Only then you can live
here peacefully

118
00:11:58,248 --> 00:12:01,058
Over here boss will proclaim a
decree, you obey that one

119
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:02,286
Boss, come on proclaim it

120
00:12:02,482 --> 00:12:04,893
Today itself you both
should divorce

121
00:12:05,081 --> 00:12:08,062
Then after that hold her by
hair and stamp her to the ground

122
00:12:08,247 --> 00:12:10,351
You should also receive
what is obtained from her

123
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,551
After that both should
depart to two different paths

124
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:18,121
On the next day both of you should
come here along with compatriots

125
00:12:18,512 --> 00:12:21,584
At that time I'll unite both
of you, that is enough

126
00:12:22,345 --> 00:12:25,325
That is what I like also
Fellow make them understand

127
00:12:28,044 --> 00:12:30,251
What have you decided?
What's to him? If we live together

128
00:12:30,411 --> 00:12:33,823
After all, he has told this much with
strain, he is yourfathefs age, no?

129
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:36,388
Just obey that
We won't obey

130
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:39,452
Is it fixed? I'm not like the boss

131
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:44,451
I'll just start, just enquire about this
Kakka Madhu at native, will know

132
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:48,215
Will just shit around your
home and make it stink!

133
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:52,380
Please don't run
Why as if not familiar?

134
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,383
Have met on tree top, no?
Just one minute

135
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:57,781
Get lost, dog!
Don't throw!

136
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,011
Its 12 years of imprisonment
on getting killed

137
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,278
Please leave me
Wilson what are you doing?

138
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,408
You stop there all the arrangements
have been started there

139
00:13:04,573 --> 00:13:06,916
Take the vehicle, somehow
we'll escape - To where?

140
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:08,847
Should go after completing
this episode, please

141
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,540
Its a big head ache
with these channel people

142
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:12,849
If someone with bit of
complexion and height is seen -

143
00:13:12,938 --> 00:13:15,315
- will stop them and ask questions
Then I don't have any problems

144
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:16,208
Hello?

145
00:13:16,604 --> 00:13:19,448
Have you acted in movies?
Yeah, King Kong

146
00:13:19,837 --> 00:13:21,179
Very similar to Jayan

147
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,315
I was also fooled like this
by saying some actor's name

148
00:13:28,469 --> 00:13:30,847
Who was that actor?
Just say it -'Alummoodan'

149
00:13:31,235 --> 00:13:33,237
Jayan is correct, no?
Jayan is ready - Come man

150
00:13:33,402 --> 00:13:36,382
Man, since my talents are
understood, will tell the story and go

151
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,036
What is the name?
Rahul

152
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:40,340
But there is no match between
the name and shape

153
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:44,471
What we need here is, to tell the
general character of this native

154
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,375
Are you ready?
Ready - Camera

155
00:13:46,567 --> 00:13:52,482
'Perumal Desham' is a native where
everyone works for 24 hours

156
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,005
Without sweating"
Never be humbug

157
00:13:55,166 --> 00:13:58,237
No! People who believes
shouldn't eat food

158
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:00,173
Then how come you
both are not toiling?

159
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:02,867
That is because we
don't belong here

160
00:14:03,064 --> 00:14:04,042
Will understand that as
the story proceeds

161
00:14:04,264 --> 00:14:07,177
Then this jealousy, envy, backbiting
that is not present in this native

162
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:09,440
That is the reason why police
men do not have any job here

163
00:14:09,563 --> 00:14:11,133
To learn from the farm lands here -

164
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:13,809
- kids used to come on tour
from schools in the city

165
00:14:13,996 --> 00:14:17,909
Not only that, there is no fees
or ticket to see all this

166
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:20,872
Kids who come here, should
toil in the soil for 5 minutes

167
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:21,938
That's the condition here

168
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:24,005
One village cultivates
with a single soul

169
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:27,174
To learn that several people
comes from various places

170
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:29,773
'Perumal Desham' becomes
the role model for the world

171
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:31,303
Whatever it is, the reason
behind this success will be -

172
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,440
- Agricultural Officer over here
Isn't it?

173
00:14:37,426 --> 00:14:38,426
Is it not?

174
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,025
Where you the people who
came to office yesterday? - Yes

175
00:14:58,157 --> 00:15:00,193
Where is the soil's sample?
Its kept over there

176
00:15:00,322 --> 00:15:02,859
From now on only two days in
a week, Tuesday and Friday

177
00:15:02,956 --> 00:15:04,902
The field visit will be
only that much, okay

178
00:15:05,056 --> 00:15:07,467
Previous officer has
told, there is no need -

179
00:15:07,555 --> 00:15:08,363
- of an Agricultural
Officer here

180
00:15:08,488 --> 00:15:10,058
Farming is as per
your own techniques

181
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:12,826
For several years its like this madam
Carry on but when there is an -

182
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,261
- Agricultural Disaster,
don't blame me

183
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:19,992
As the six months village service is
compulsory that is why I came here

184
00:15:35,584 --> 00:15:40,124
On considering the thickness
of its skin and smell

185
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:42,957
On one season will fetch
around 3,000 mangoes

186
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,461
Madam, no need to get
3,000 at least a 100 will do

187
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:48,763
But what to do, that is not a
mango tree its a Jackfruit tree!

188
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:55,827
Standing under the Jackfru it tree
don't know what is the invention

189
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:59,493
At what time where you told to come
here? I'll report this and suspend you

190
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:02,226
Look, releasing the anger on
you which is meant towards us

191
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,382
Okay bear it
What else to do?

192
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,852
Madam, did you say or show
any foolishness here? - Look!

193
00:16:09,979 --> 00:16:13,222
Be careful while talking
I can understand your situation

194
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,824
A subject and a job which
is not at all interested

195
00:16:16,178 --> 00:16:17,919
When all this mixes its like a ..

196
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:23,223
With the joint cultivation, the
rice production is double -

197
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,414
- than what is required for this village

198
00:16:24,544 --> 00:16:26,421
From the income generated
by exporting that

199
00:16:26,577 --> 00:16:27,487
A happy life

200
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:30,187
Then what is the secret behind
the success of 'Perumal Desham?'

201
00:16:30,376 --> 00:16:32,322
That is not a big secret, its public

202
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:35,011
In this native place,
there was no politics

203
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:37,051
What a native, without politics?

204
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:39,419
Marxist party, congress, BJP

205
00:16:40,108 --> 00:16:42,418
Don't talk politics
Can't even talk politics?

206
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:45,249
Fear not, what we have told
was the situation an year back

207
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,284
As per the decision of
ancient fore fathers

208
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:50,012
Politician's were not allowed to
enter inside 'Perumal Desham'

209
00:16:50,207 --> 00:16:53,449
All though there were two sides
like 'Pilla Cheri, Perumal Cheri'

210
00:16:53,573 --> 00:16:55,246
All had one soul

211
00:16:55,573 --> 00:16:58,485
But there should be a person
who should lead a native, no?

212
00:16:58,772 --> 00:17:00,080
Yeah, there is
Who is that?

213
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,006
Grab and pull down

214
00:17:28,368 --> 00:17:29,938
That was great

215
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:23,164
Catch man
Catch

216
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:33,272
Didn't I say to do like what I said?

217
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,328
Now he is also out
What are you looking at?

218
00:18:57,488 --> 00:18:58,762
Catch him

219
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:11,231
Someone push that
line over to here

220
00:19:22,085 --> 00:19:25,190
Has touched the white line by hand

221
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:47,192
For prize distribution welcomes
respected President

222
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:53,989
Put him here, over here

223
00:19:56,814 --> 00:19:58,316
Okay take it
One minute, one minute

224
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,483
Why one minute? Was it for mike?
Greetings

225
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:05,383
As it is a part of festival, I
don't see this as a competition

226
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:09,215
Because of that I wish to share
this trophy along with Arjunan

227
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:15,222
Go man! -Let him go, if he wishes
Karthikeyan collect the trophy

228
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:17,323
Give it here
Sister you hold this

229
00:20:17,444 --> 00:20:21,323
Clap hands, all of you

230
00:20:24,343 --> 00:20:28,188
Yeah, collect it
Its for me

231
00:20:29,342 --> 00:20:31,219
Hey wait, Arjuna!

232
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:32,352
Hey fellow

233
00:20:32,842 --> 00:20:35,185
Your usual show off to get the
applause of native people

234
00:20:35,308 --> 00:20:37,151
Don't take it out to Arjunan
What are you saying?

235
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:42,052
Fellow, I don't want your favours, by
defeating you, I'll win that trophy

236
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,810
We won..We won the trophy

237
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:06,348
Padmajam, here comes our son

238
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:12,345
I understood father has ridiculed me

239
00:21:12,503 --> 00:21:14,039
So have you been
that much intelligent?

240
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:16,149
Seems father was really smart

241
00:21:16,269 --> 00:21:19,078
What is the use of saying son of
Velu Pilla who shook the native?

242
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:20,476
Once upon a time

243
00:21:21,002 --> 00:21:22,982
Lady, my son is lucky

244
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:26,705
Because each and every time when
I fail with Perumal and retreat

245
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:30,337
My father wasn't there for my
support for that matter my son is lucky

246
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:32,502
For the reason when he has
started to fail

247
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,837
As his father I'm also there
along with him!

248
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:38,275
May be to fail together
Father-Get lost man

249
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:41,209
<i>They are always
like 'Halwa and Anchovy'</i>

250
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:44,070
Fellow, whom did you
com pare to Anchovy?

251
00:21:44,232 --> 00:21:46,142
It is boss only -What?
Anchovy, isn't a small fish, now

252
00:21:46,264 --> 00:21:46,901
Is it so?

253
00:21:47,231 --> 00:21:50,474
Father, from now on
I know what to do

254
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,468
I don't need anyone's help for that

255
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:55,037
When starts to fail to
an equally aged person-

256
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:58,201
-any young man will have
such a courage

257
00:21:58,363 --> 00:22:01,343
That shouldn't be extinguished, it
is there where you have to win

258
00:22:01,762 --> 00:22:04,800
Must win even if by chopping
the head of Perumal -

259
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:06,463
- chieftain of 'Perumal
Desham', okay with that!

260
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:09,968
Then what is the head kept
ready to take and come?

261
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:14,369
What did you say?- Boss Pilla,
till last I'll be with young boss

262
00:22:14,727 --> 00:22:17,207
Till the sixteenth day after death,
after that will you send me home?

263
00:22:17,827 --> 00:22:18,737
<i>O</i> Kay

264
00:22:21,826 --> 00:22:22,861
Will it come true?

265
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:27,295
How can one eat this?
Its not at all tasty

266
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:30,439
So, that is it, showing the
anger to mom, since you failed

267
00:22:30,758 --> 00:22:32,465
If you would have shown
half boldness over there -

268
00:22:32,758 --> 00:22:34,395
- you could have out
smarted Karthi, is it?

269
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:39,863
I'll tell one thing and at last shouldn't
say Kakka Madhu has told that

270
00:22:40,024 --> 00:22:41,866
What is it man?
Why not change his name?

271
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,333
By publishing in a Gazette

272
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:45,197
Something like Chinju
Mon or Sunni Kuttan

273
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:46,802
If its like that, when going
outside no one will notice

274
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:49,367
Shucks! Stop it man!
Fellow, sit there

275
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:53,201
Saying out of grief
as you always fail

276
00:22:53,389 --> 00:22:55,800
Very courageous before others

277
00:22:55,954 --> 00:22:57,865
Boss, it is something
like a stinking failure

278
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:01,967
At least once be a winner, at least
on this don't be like own father

279
00:23:02,154 --> 00:23:04,360
Make the compatriots to praise

280
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,389
Indeed they will be made to praise!

281
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,830
I'll make them praise on me, all
those jerks who are with him today

282
00:23:09,952 --> 00:23:12,159
I'll make them to praise on me
Come up like that

283
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:14,959
And after that the 'Vadakkepadam'
it will be enclosed in my name

284
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:18,190
For all these things to happen
which is told by boss

285
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:20,763
Should enter some politics

286
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:23,960
What did you say man?
Didn't you understand?

287
00:23:24,117 --> 00:23:26,791
Only by becoming a politician only
then people with Karthi -

288
00:23:26,884 --> 00:23:29,057
- can be brought to your side

289
00:23:29,184 --> 00:23:31,959
Yeah, that's true as per the
rules made by fore fathers

290
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:34,959
In this 'Perumal Desham' no
political parties are allowed

291
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,824
No one should get separated by
politics, then how to create?

292
00:23:39,248 --> 00:23:41,728
Why don't we violate that rule?

293
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,183
Why don't we bring politics here?

294
00:23:47,181 --> 00:23:50,458
Attention should be changed
from farming to politics

295
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:54,260
Leader, Arjunan Pilla lead on!
Shout once again fellow

296
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:58,261
To be honest on hearing this
political slogan, goosebumps burst!

297
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:01,689
Leader, Arjunan Pilla lead on!

298
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:05,785
All though on the board, its written
as restaurant, its a tea shop

299
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,121
The owner is the one who
searches on the mobile

300
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:11,814
Yeah, I'm Sakuni Pilla

301
00:24:12,011 --> 00:24:15,480
This tea shop was started
by my grand fathefs father

302
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:20,087
On sitting here will know all the
news taking place in this native

303
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:23,346
Sakuni Pilla, take one hot tea

304
00:24:24,442 --> 00:24:27,149
There is a big news to tell

305
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:29,321
Lack of teeth will be
compensated by tongue

306
00:24:29,441 --> 00:24:31,478
News distributor, BBC Shaji

307
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,151
Sudhakaran's wife, yesterday
while going to town

308
00:24:37,174 --> 00:24:40,053
While lifting the sword, it touched
the power line, got electric shock

309
00:24:40,207 --> 00:24:42,686
After that had not gone for rituals,
says he is a 'Velichappadu' (Oracle)

310
00:24:42,806 --> 00:24:44,114
Are you looking at the
'obituary column?'

311
00:24:44,173 --> 00:24:46,449
Hey man,time has not
come for your photo to appear

312
00:24:50,305 --> 00:24:51,750
Chetta,(brother) one tea

313
00:24:52,172 --> 00:24:53,981
Tea? Will get it soon

314
00:24:55,004 --> 00:25:00,886
Since he got that thing, he won't
notice, keeps on poking

315
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:02,947
Chetta, tea
There is no milk to put tea

316
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:05,708
On that grief I ate two
'Bonda'(nibble) Do you know?

317
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,440
For everything there is an 'app'
Isn't it?

318
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:10,108
On putting a splinter
will there be milk?

319
00:25:10,235 --> 00:25:12,340
Chetta, take the 'app'
of milk and download it

320
00:25:13,035 --> 00:25:15,913
Then download the milk
sufficient for two tea

321
00:25:16,368 --> 00:25:19,838
Don't ridicule, everything
will come very soon

322
00:25:20,001 --> 00:25:23,345
But can't live without
this 'Facebook' and 'watts up'

323
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,302
This is the current trend

324
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,775
Boss, its very difficult, isn't it?

325
00:25:37,431 --> 00:25:39,809
Thing are going out of control, no?

326
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:41,067
Did you see?

327
00:25:41,432 --> 00:25:44,105
Every where there is
Perumal and his men

328
00:25:44,497 --> 00:25:49,003
He is the who is ruling this
land, if this is continued -

329
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:51,109
- boss, will have to leave this place

330
00:25:52,196 --> 00:25:56,440
On saying buddy of boss
everyone in this native ridicules

331
00:25:58,195 --> 00:26:02,473
Stop it fellow, I want to rule
this 'Perumal Desham' one day

332
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,970
Boss, now rule of Baron is not
possible that was in olden days

333
00:26:06,294 --> 00:26:09,798
On thinking to bring democratic
rule, there is no politics over here

334
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:14,173
If it were there, boss could have
ruled this native somehow

335
00:26:15,093 --> 00:26:19,165
If so, we'll bring politics,
what do you say?

336
00:26:19,959 --> 00:26:23,099
That's good, people here
aren't interested on politics

337
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,237
Should create an interest
How is that?

338
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:32,705
One person should come, who can
entice people on speaking politics

339
00:26:32,923 --> 00:26:37,963
Boss, who is there for that?
There is..'Pala Thankachan!'

340
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:47,769
In that case, boss you call him
Okay, now what's the time?

341
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:53,427
Time is 11 O'clock- If called at 11
O'clock, he'll ask me am I decent?

342
00:26:53,754 --> 00:26:56,166
No need, will call
tomorrow morning

343
00:26:56,387 --> 00:27:01,267
That Lion! Pala Thankachan!
Yeah, Pala Thankachan

344
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,100
What is it man?
Did they say like that?

345
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:07,830
If at all when my photo
is seen on the poster -

346
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:09,295
- did they say won't give donation?

347
00:27:09,485 --> 00:27:12,694
What am I hearing?
You do one thing

348
00:27:13,352 --> 00:27:17,766
Ask to that ration shop owner,
only that place is left out

349
00:27:19,018 --> 00:27:23,659
What he is not there?
Check at the field or work site

350
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,427
What, are they all Bengalis?

351
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:29,419
Fellow, not at all difficult
to find Malayalee

352
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:32,652
One who works
in the sun is Bengali

353
00:27:32,815 --> 00:27:35,658
One who watches in the shade
popping an umbrella is Malayalee

354
00:27:35,814 --> 00:27:39,057
Ask them
Sir, are you Pala Thankachan?

355
00:27:39,281 --> 00:27:41,921
Yeah, do you know me?
Have heard

356
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:44,389
Sometimes I give
interview to channels

357
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:48,753
Its a big nuisance what to
do when followers compel

358
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,716
Sir, to which party do you belong?
There is nothing like that

359
00:27:51,846 --> 00:27:54,258
Ruling party -Has not told so
far where sir wants to go?

360
00:27:54,346 --> 00:27:57,656
There is a small village over
here, what was its name?

361
00:27:57,811 --> 00:27:59,654
Its on the tip of the
tongue, can't say it

362
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,757
YeahflPerumal Desham'

363
00:28:02,478 --> 00:28:06,948
My mother! - What a brake,
why did you press it?

364
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,714
No that sir, what is it that sir
told, where you wanted to go?

365
00:28:08,877 --> 00:28:09,947
'Perumal Desham'

366
00:28:12,976 --> 00:28:15,718
Sir, this is the place
which is told by sir

367
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:18,055
Go straight from here

368
00:28:18,475 --> 00:28:21,422
By the way doesn't the vehicle
reach there? -No sir, I've another trip

369
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,321
Okay, okay how much is the
fare? Rs. 60 -What Rs. 60?

370
00:28:26,774 --> 00:28:29,118
What are you saying?
Check that meter and say

371
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,413
Sir either on checking or without
checking meter, its Rs. 60

372
00:28:31,706 --> 00:28:33,014
I've set it like that

373
00:28:33,373 --> 00:28:37,412
Too high, okay
Okay take it

374
00:28:38,006 --> 00:28:41,418
Sir, with this dress of sir, can
I take a selfie along with sir?

375
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,842
What to do with this follower'?

376
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,247
Where ever I go there will be a follower
- That will be there

377
00:28:46,438 --> 00:28:47,712
Okay take it
Shall I take?

378
00:28:47,871 --> 00:28:48,906
Sir, put that hand on the shoulder

379
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:51,746
Done, let me see
Great!

380
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:55,080
Am I really great?

381
00:28:55,237 --> 00:28:56,910
Why not?
What a glamour

382
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,980
Sir, other than this political
dress which is worn now

383
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:00,672
Is there any other dress to change?

384
00:29:00,769 --> 00:29:02,009
For the time being, no

385
00:29:02,136 --> 00:29:06,084
Then, sir you may keep this money
What giving back the money?

386
00:29:06,236 --> 00:29:08,408
Sir, for the first time only, I'm giving
back the fare- Oh, follower!

387
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:11,840
Sir, before you enterjust read
that board which is seen there

388
00:29:11,968 --> 00:29:12,776
Board?

389
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:20,441
'Don't, think, engage in politics.
Entry for politicians till here'

390
00:29:22,266 --> 00:29:25,645
Aniya(Younger brother)
Something is fishy on reading it

391
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:28,205
People like us, can we
survive here?

392
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:31,711
My sir, this is the only village
in Kerala free from politics

393
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:35,404
Not only sir, no politician has
got a place in this village

394
00:29:35,897 --> 00:29:39,435
Over here, sir is the first person
to enter wearing this dress

395
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:42,004
As if someone has set foot
at the moon long back

396
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:45,643
That is the reason why sir's
photo is taken on my phone

397
00:29:45,763 --> 00:29:48,039
Tomorrow, my kids have to
learn that -What is that for?

398
00:29:48,196 --> 00:29:51,176
From this very moment sir
is going to be a historic figure

399
00:29:51,262 --> 00:29:53,674
Not on seeing sir's glamour

400
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:56,365
But anyway its a good dress
Thanks

401
00:30:02,694 --> 00:30:05,765
Fellow Brittas, one tea
in which finger is not put

402
00:30:05,893 --> 00:30:07,804
One tea without putting fingers, no?
I'll give now

403
00:30:08,093 --> 00:30:11,733
Has not given a girl that suits me,
then wants a tea without fingers

404
00:30:13,259 --> 00:30:16,172
Here!
Why are you so angry?

405
00:30:16,392 --> 00:30:19,235
You simply become
Brittas, don't be British

406
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:22,266
Won't he show the angel'?

407
00:30:22,391 --> 00:30:26,839
After saying will arrange a girl for
him, Kuruppu hasn't done that

408
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:30,804
My Sakuni Chetta, will an ordinary
girl suit a handsome guy like him?

409
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:32,129
Kuruppu Chetta, don't simply..

410
00:30:33,089 --> 00:30:35,399
Fellow, a thing which is not
told by anyone so far

411
00:30:35,756 --> 00:30:39,828
My mistake he told by looking at
your face, don't you want that?

412
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:41,127
An insolent fellow!

413
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:45,192
To all, I'm saying don't teach Brittas
to put a hole on 'Uzhunnu Vada'

414
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:48,961
Now on you will remain
putting the holes -Go man

415
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:52,895
Fellow Brittas, come here you don't
worry have you seen my tab?

416
00:30:53,053 --> 00:30:54,726
Kuruppetta, don't say
such things, okay

417
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,855
ls my job to check someone's pipe?

418
00:30:56,953 --> 00:30:59,125
Hey fool, its not tap, its tab

419
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:01,765
Have you seen this?
On watching the girls in this

420
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:03,364
Even the Shakkeela will fail

421
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:07,827
Hey Kuruppu, are you a
marriage broker or a pimp?

422
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:10,124
BBC shouldn't talk who has
got no teeth in the mouth

423
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:17,868
For exposing the nude photos of
females, marriage broker is in custody

424
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:20,323
Keep on reading the news
paper right now

425
00:31:20,416 --> 00:31:21,918
On the forthcoming
'Karkidakam'(July 16th -August 15th)

426
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,051
This body is for the com patriots
to do the funeral rituals

427
00:31:26,716 --> 00:31:27,921
Yeah,yeah

428
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:30,192
Go, I say go fellows

429
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:37,123
Okay stop it, never again
I'll wear this 'Kadhar' dress

430
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:40,261
Is that enough?
Now go and play -Come, we'll go

431
00:31:40,847 --> 00:31:42,883
Come we'll go and play

432
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:52,721
"Lead on leader like
that..Five to eight behind you"

433
00:31:55,211 --> 00:31:58,215
Are you Thankachan?
Yes, Pala Thankachan

434
00:31:58,344 --> 00:32:00,756
Looks like boys over
here really welcomed you

435
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:02,890
Lucky that the shorts
aren't on 'Kadhar'-

436
00:32:03,043 --> 00:32:04,113
- otherwise could have taken it

437
00:32:04,976 --> 00:32:07,718
Never mind, don't
take all this seriously

438
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:11,786
All though its first time for me
here, outside its usual for me

439
00:32:12,675 --> 00:32:15,178
How difficult it was to
drive off the kids?

440
00:32:15,442 --> 00:32:17,819
Handsome, are you married?

441
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:18,713
No

442
00:32:18,874 --> 00:32:21,878
Divorced due to reasons other
than your involvement?

443
00:32:21,974 --> 00:32:22,884
Not that one

444
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:26,045
For anything there is a solution, in
this tab there is a good collection

445
00:32:26,207 --> 00:32:28,209
Take a look but don't
change the folder

446
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,276
If changed, on seeing it
won't feel like marrying

447
00:32:31,406 --> 00:32:34,012
Hey fellow, keep quite okay

448
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,882
On seeing anyone
tries to get them married

449
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:40,942
Madhu..-What is it?
Is it that Lion?

450
00:32:41,071 --> 00:32:44,176
To teach politics to the people
of village that guy from Pala?

451
00:32:44,637 --> 00:32:47,049
Yeah has come as boss
Ganapathy Pilla has told

452
00:32:49,404 --> 00:32:51,906
What is this a modern dress
and a loin cloth on the shoulder'?

453
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,641
A mis match in dressing

454
00:32:54,803 --> 00:32:57,215
Seeing for the first
time, things like this

455
00:32:58,202 --> 00:33:00,705
Nowadays, often
when I go for programs

456
00:33:00,902 --> 00:33:02,074
Will wear a Bermuda under it

457
00:33:02,202 --> 00:33:05,808
Can't say when the political
situations will change

458
00:33:05,934 --> 00:33:07,004
A precaution

459
00:33:07,334 --> 00:33:10,076
This Pala Thankachan
can't be defeated

460
00:33:11,434 --> 00:33:13,344
Here come the boss Pilla
Has he come?

461
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,046
We'll go there, come

462
00:33:19,332 --> 00:33:20,902
For the attention of everyone -

463
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:24,171
Here Thankachan is
introduced by this Ganapathy Pilla

464
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,675
Politics will be brought
here and I'll rule here

465
00:33:28,731 --> 00:33:29,937
Come man, get inside the vehicle

466
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:35,244
His Perumal colony,
festival and hosting flag

467
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,373
I'll show everyone

468
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:54,900
What is it Chetta? (brother)
Plantain saplings

469
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,199
Last week only you
took four or five saplings

470
00:33:57,394 --> 00:33:59,374
Where is it?
It was eaten by termite

471
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,799
Buy something else for the termite
to eat, this is for cultivation

472
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:05,633
Come, looks like you have eaten it
No, no

473
00:34:05,726 --> 00:34:06,727
Then simply blaming the termite

474
00:34:06,893 --> 00:34:09,031
Yeah Pappa, no need
that is not good

475
00:34:09,158 --> 00:34:11,764
The one which is send
first, that moustache

476
00:34:11,959 --> 00:34:13,700
On the face, there is a tough look

477
00:34:13,892 --> 00:34:17,065
The second one, what was it?
Anand

478
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:19,033
That persons nose is not correct

479
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:21,000
We'll think of other grooms, okay?

480
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:26,001
Madam, I'll arrange a handsome
boy from this native

481
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:30,926
I've told before, should collect the
signature of farmers and workers

482
00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:33,899
On the day when my project is
approved, on that day I'll go -

483
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:37,628
- from this crude village,
this smoke, dust and heat

484
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,222
Who is that? On a tractor

485
00:34:43,954 --> 00:34:46,400
One who drives that
tractor, is the actual tractor

486
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:48,633
That person only
mows this entire native

487
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,665
Greetings Karthietta

488
00:34:52,419 --> 00:34:54,660
Still now hasn't supplied
these saplings to anyone?

489
00:34:56,252 --> 00:34:58,060
Yeah, Karthietta, are you fine?

490
00:35:08,051 --> 00:35:11,998
What is it? - From this year last going
to implement organic farming in the state

491
00:35:12,149 --> 00:35:14,356
Might be knowing that, no?
Tell the matter

492
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:16,821
Madam, finish checking
that and then I will say

493
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:21,185
My goodness, madam is
preparing some big projects

494
00:35:21,382 --> 00:35:23,692
For that needs a sign for
a big person only then -

495
00:35:23,782 --> 00:35:25,727
- will get the job at the
University in Australia

496
00:35:25,814 --> 00:35:27,589
Checking those things, isn't it?

497
00:35:28,147 --> 00:35:29,592
You may tell, what it is

498
00:35:29,714 --> 00:35:32,092
With that chemical farming and
modern farming is coming to an end

499
00:35:32,281 --> 00:35:34,692
Might be knowing that one also, isn't
it? - Have you come to take class?

500
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,184
Three Degree

501
00:35:38,847 --> 00:35:40,848
Should prepare the
com patriots for that one

502
00:35:41,712 --> 00:35:43,214
Experts will come
and take the clas s-

503
00:35:43,379 --> 00:35:45,222
- for that official
request should go from here

504
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:50,852
Why, a sort of astonishment?
Are you hearing for the first time?

505
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:54,184
First time for me also
I'll do it, whatever it is

506
00:35:54,344 --> 00:35:57,223
By the way its a government office
there are certain procedures here

507
00:35:57,677 --> 00:36:01,180
When the officers are lackadaisical,
there are certain procedures in this native

508
00:36:01,942 --> 00:36:05,151
Are you threatening me
or trying to be over smart?

509
00:36:05,609 --> 00:36:08,953
Too bad, showing off by shouting
What is this man?

510
00:36:09,275 --> 00:36:10,811
Fellow, throw him out

511
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:12,279
Karthietta, please

512
00:36:12,708 --> 00:36:14,812
We people who are wise
should pardon Karthietta

513
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:17,352
Madam, for the first time to
this native -What is this?

514
00:36:17,674 --> 00:36:19,153
What a place is this?
Hey girl!

515
00:36:19,274 --> 00:36:20,344
If you say anything about the native

516
00:36:20,707 --> 00:36:21,844
On hitting over aged
for the tooth to sprout

517
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:24,783
Hey You! -What is it?
Karthi what is the issue?

518
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,880
What is it Anu?
Swetha, while coming for a job

519
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:30,383
The minimum thing is,
should have a passion for that job

520
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:32,207
If that's not there like this in front
of people who comes to office -

521
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:33,647
-will keep on looking at laptop

522
00:36:33,738 --> 00:36:35,717
Look, before evening
the request should go

523
00:36:35,904 --> 00:36:37,212
Gone long back

524
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,384
By the way what's up
with that farming grant?

525
00:36:40,704 --> 00:36:45,049
Be bold Karthi, everything is
positive I've given a detailed report

526
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,213
Look, this is passion
watch and learn

527
00:36:50,636 --> 00:36:53,378
Who is he? What did he think?
Simply to shine

528
00:36:53,936 --> 00:36:56,916
No, Karthi is a person who is
not at all interested to shine

529
00:36:57,868 --> 00:37:01,782
Look, he wants the help from
BDO, that's why, grant and all

530
00:37:01,868 --> 00:37:03,744
That's not for him,
its for other people

531
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:05,642
For whoever it is, its all the same

532
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,278
My An u, for you Australia is good

533
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,111
Let the study report reach here

534
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:29,171
Hey You!
One minute

535
00:37:33,029 --> 00:37:35,100
What is it fellow?
By the wayArjunan

536
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:38,072
Our grand father's had started this
quarrel and competition, long ago

537
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,638
In between that don't
drag our native place

538
00:37:40,762 --> 00:37:44,175
What man, is patriotism
only endorsed to you?

539
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,069
Not that, you should also
have it that is what is said

540
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:50,970
Look, heard that you are bringing
someone called Pala Thankachan

541
00:37:51,761 --> 00:37:55,367
Heard that you are going to bring
politics and you are going to be a leader

542
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:58,572
Yes Karthi going to
become a leader

543
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:02,003
Still now you have been enjoying
the pleasure of it now let me enjoy it

544
00:38:02,059 --> 00:38:04,130
Arjuna, politics is good

545
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:06,704
Its something great, but
should be good politics

546
00:38:07,025 --> 00:38:10,165
There are lot of people here
who lives only by loving this soil

547
00:38:10,358 --> 00:38:13,134
Shouldn't divide them by
showing the colour of the flag

548
00:38:14,057 --> 00:38:17,061
Arjuna, where sweat sheds,
don't allow the blood to shed

549
00:38:18,224 --> 00:38:21,329
Pleading
No, won't shed blood

550
00:38:21,856 --> 00:38:24,803
Then shall we come to a deal?

551
00:38:26,056 --> 00:38:28,331
That 360 acre, regarding
that 'Vadakepadam'

552
00:38:28,588 --> 00:38:31,728
Once that comes to a
deal, the issue is solved

553
00:38:32,755 --> 00:38:36,827
Look, after that we aren't enemies
we are business partners

554
00:38:37,354 --> 00:38:39,994
Haven't I told, the company
has placed big offers

555
00:38:40,154 --> 00:38:42,997
Not only I and you this
native will also flourish

556
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:47,167
These native people who gets
10 or 100 by selling vegetables

557
00:38:47,286 --> 00:38:48,923
Let them play with 1000's

558
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,732
No way man, I won't allow
you to play with 1,000's -

559
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:54,331
- gained on selling this native

560
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:58,189
Is it the final?
First and for the last time, no way

561
00:38:58,684 --> 00:39:02,131
Then Karthika Perumal sir
move away that BMW

562
00:39:02,251 --> 00:39:04,161
Or else the blood will
start shedding now itself

563
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:19,029
Father, didn't that Thankachan
come? - Do you attend those classes?

564
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:22,185
Asked the students,
said its going okay

565
00:39:22,315 --> 00:39:25,784
Seems okay, has brought
after spending lot of money

566
00:39:25,914 --> 00:39:27,655
-better if something happens

567
00:39:27,914 --> 00:39:30,326
Father you just stand in front, I'll
arrange the rest of the things

568
00:39:30,746 --> 00:39:35,161
If I keep on standing for you,
my fear is I'll become a stone

569
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:38,820
Greetings

570
00:39:40,012 --> 00:39:42,618
Come tutor was speaking about you

571
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:46,020
What all difficulties to bring you
here, I should be honoured, no?

572
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:48,691
I'm really intelligent -What is
not there in the native

573
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,187
Its good that someone has it

574
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:52,678
May sit
Thank you

575
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,883
Heard that classes are
going very well - Indeed!

576
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,180
Before teaching the things to kids
They teach in return

577
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:04,053
A real good progress
That is all true

578
00:40:04,242 --> 00:40:06,721
There is no much time left for the
election, don't forget that one?

579
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:11,021
Boss Pilla, if my
calculations are correct

580
00:40:11,274 --> 00:40:16,313
The next authority in this
native will be..Boss!

581
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,580
But for that shouldn't go this way

582
00:40:22,372 --> 00:40:23,942
How to go?

583
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:27,917
Which means for the politics
to emerge in a place

584
00:40:28,105 --> 00:40:30,745
Exploitation should take
place, political exploitation

585
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:33,818
If it happens, then the problems
will arise automatically

586
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,610
Right there we should interfere,
political interference

587
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:40,979
We will solve it, then
we become the leaders

588
00:40:41,136 --> 00:40:43,912
Compatriots will start to
shout, leader lead on..

589
00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:48,209
In nut shell I don't
see any problems over here

590
00:40:48,568 --> 00:40:55,280
We should create it, when there is a
spark..We should blow it and flame it

591
00:40:57,834 --> 00:40:59,939
We should start to think that way

592
00:41:02,699 --> 00:41:07,808
To create problems, as far as I know
there is no one like my son in this native

593
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:13,547
Because from the day he was born
I started having endless problems

594
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:15,108
True by God

595
00:41:15,998 --> 00:41:19,707
Then the only relief is when
embarked on any issue

596
00:41:19,864 --> 00:41:21,343
Will be a miserable failure

597
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,643
That is explicit on seeing

598
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:28,006
Father, all though I'm ridiculed I
understood seriousness of matter

599
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:34,604
There will not be any
peace at this 'Perumal Desham'

600
00:41:35,162 --> 00:41:36,334
I'll take care of that

601
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:42,937
According to
geographical conditions -

602
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:45,768
- farming is very difficult in
a country like South Korea

603
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:49,965
Hills, barren land but the interest
and enthusiasm of people

604
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:51,628
That was their victory

605
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:54,138
There is a village called
"Manjuwa" in Brazil

606
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:56,796
We should experiment their
cultivation technique over here

607
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,834
Do you know what it is?
To cite an example

608
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:01,836
My field and enclosure will be
leased to John for 6 months

609
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,336
And in return I'll work in John's field

610
00:42:04,625 --> 00:42:06,900
Everyone will share
the cultivation lands

611
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:10,138
Like that they will like
all the soil in the village

612
00:42:10,224 --> 00:42:11,998
There is no jealousy or selfishness

613
00:42:12,156 --> 00:42:14,796
For the soil there is no crime
He is shinning

614
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:19,870
In the morning when coming on a
tractor understood he is egoistic

615
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,098
Why are you not saying anything?

616
00:42:22,255 --> 00:42:23,290
I'm listening

617
00:42:24,055 --> 00:42:26,193
Should show that he is
more educated than the -

618
00:42:26,321 --> 00:42:27,994
- one who studies
farming scientifically

619
00:42:28,121 --> 00:42:29,794
Some people are like that,
there are people who says -

620
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:31,764
People with old seventh standard
has got more knowledge -

621
00:42:31,888 --> 00:42:33,594
- than the people with
MA, some babble like that

622
00:42:33,953 --> 00:42:35,899
He has installed this
over here, purposefully

623
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,123
To show it to me

624
00:42:37,287 --> 00:42:40,927
My Anu, he has fixed
solar panel near the field

625
00:42:41,352 --> 00:42:43,958
The classes for the farmers
are conducted there

626
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,895
Not polluting by using generator

627
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:51,056
Not that, your stay over here
he might not have noticed

628
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:58,124
Mary, serve the food

629
00:43:08,782 --> 00:43:12,594
Boss..
Things are some what getting tight

630
00:43:12,648 --> 00:43:14,719
Right now there are lot of youths
over there to learn politics

631
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:17,787
Like that new changes should come

632
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:21,325
Perumal's 'Baron Rule'
should end here

633
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,091
I've met those boys
and had given money

634
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,922
They will be needful can be useful

635
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:31,783
How intelligent he is, what is
your opinion about him?

636
00:43:31,912 --> 00:43:32,890
Father of boss!

637
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:34,690
No, son

638
00:43:37,744 --> 00:43:40,623
Come on walk
Isn't he the son?

639
00:43:42,311 --> 00:43:44,256
Hi
Hi

640
00:43:45,577 --> 00:43:47,784
From today onwards
practical class will start

641
00:43:47,977 --> 00:43:51,822
That is the reason why all
are told to wear political dress

642
00:43:53,176 --> 00:43:55,782
Does anyone know what we
are going to learn today?

643
00:43:56,742 --> 00:43:59,244
Tell -The first lessons to learn
when entering into politics

644
00:44:01,008 --> 00:44:03,716
In that do you know
what is to be learned at first?

645
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:05,854
Should learn very well to tell lies
Good

646
00:44:06,074 --> 00:44:10,614
But when other's hear it, it should
be felt as if its an absolute truth

647
00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:15,077
Should give promises
Correct, a small correction

648
00:44:15,173 --> 00:44:17,779
Give promises without shame

649
00:44:17,872 --> 00:44:19,509
Sir, I need to discuss a matter

650
00:44:19,705 --> 00:44:22,083
Tell -After completion of
our political study class

651
00:44:22,172 --> 00:44:25,118
Under my leadership have decided
to give a big cash prize to sir

652
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:28,775
A good thing, from where
will you collect this cash?

653
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:30,941
That will be collected
From where will you collect?

654
00:44:31,304 --> 00:44:33,112
Will you pay?
No, not possible

655
00:44:33,236 --> 00:44:34,146
Will you pay?

656
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:42,983
When the treasury is empty should
posses the guts to promise freely

657
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:46,274
That too to the tutor, you have
already become a tutor

658
00:44:46,634 --> 00:44:48,079
From here onwards,
you will reach higher

659
00:44:48,801 --> 00:44:52,044
Then one more important
matter which you should know

660
00:44:52,168 --> 00:44:54,807
There is a good relation
between acting and politics

661
00:44:54,933 --> 00:44:57,174
We should learn 'nine sentiments'

662
00:44:57,567 --> 00:44:59,774
Initially should learn
only three sentiments

663
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,778
Karuna (Kindness)Beevalsa
(fear) Shanta (calmness)

664
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,843
Karuna, while asking the vote

665
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,645
Beevalsam, immediately after
getting the vote and winning

666
00:45:08,964 --> 00:45:12,036
Shanta, when allegations
come towards us

667
00:45:12,198 --> 00:45:14,973
We should remain
calm, by ignoring all that

668
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:16,108
Then what about 'Shringar?'

669
00:45:16,264 --> 00:45:20,110
After taking the oath and when we
become minister we'll learn that

670
00:45:20,163 --> 00:45:23,735
To make our political study
class more active, my assistant-

671
00:45:23,863 --> 00:45:26,673
- Tham bikkuttan Bhagavathar,
will reach here immediately

672
00:45:27,896 --> 00:45:29,875
There is some problem
with the brake

673
00:45:33,195 --> 00:45:37,301
Brother you are looking
at it, sitting and lying

674
00:45:37,661 --> 00:45:39,868
Why? Are you checking the
sex of the vehicle? - What?

675
00:45:40,027 --> 00:45:42,098
Can you tell the route to go
to this 'Puthuval Tharavadu?'

676
00:45:42,293 --> 00:45:45,206
Who are you? Can't recognise
I'm Bhagavathar Tham bikkuttan

677
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:47,062
Came to teach music to kids

678
00:45:47,193 --> 00:45:48,763
But Ganapathy Pilla
doesn't have kids

679
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:51,939
Not only that, 'Puthuval Tharavadu'
belongs to Pilla - I need to go there

680
00:45:52,059 --> 00:45:53,595
Friend, take me to there

681
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:56,902
Look, can take you
anywhere please don't sing

682
00:45:57,024 --> 00:45:58,799
But you haven't
heard my song before

683
00:45:58,858 --> 00:46:01,566
Have been hearing it from there
Something wrong with the ear

684
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,659
Just check it -Why?
Hearing more

685
00:46:03,823 --> 00:46:05,632
Or won't hear the song from there

686
00:46:05,757 --> 00:46:06,929
Look get on
Okay I'll get on

687
00:46:08,123 --> 00:46:10,000
No songs
No, won't sing

688
00:46:10,123 --> 00:46:12,728
Like popping on this vehicle just
cling on me, okay -For what?

689
00:46:12,889 --> 00:46:15,495
There is a saying when
'grasshopper' clings on, its luck

690
00:46:17,288 --> 00:46:19,734
In our 'Perumal Desham'
certain things which -

691
00:46:19,821 --> 00:46:21,732
- has never happened is happening

692
00:46:21,855 --> 00:46:24,096
Politics, political class

693
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,622
That too in a comic set up

694
00:46:26,754 --> 00:46:29,735
Outsiders were more
and lot of money too

695
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,767
Among us they took
Shibu and Hussain

696
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,528
We also have politics
but its love towards soil

697
00:46:37,686 --> 00:46:40,962
When disaster strikes,
the people will remain united

698
00:46:41,185 --> 00:46:43,290
Just take this as
one of those disasters

699
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:45,155
To unite us more close

700
00:46:45,317 --> 00:46:49,891
Then Shekaretta, all the flowers on
a mango tree won't become mango

701
00:46:50,017 --> 00:46:50,859
At the same time

702
00:46:51,051 --> 00:46:53,587
Similarly, those people who
had departed from us -

703
00:46:53,683 --> 00:46:55,526
-just think they have
withered from us

704
00:46:55,616 --> 00:46:58,756
They will realise that we are right

705
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:02,829
Yesterday's problems didn't work
out right, we couldn't execute that

706
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:04,053
But today it shouldn't be like that

707
00:47:04,148 --> 00:47:07,185
Just stop, see there is a gathering

708
00:47:07,281 --> 00:47:09,022
On seeing a gathering,
we should involve

709
00:47:09,514 --> 00:47:11,118
Thankachan sir has particularly
mentioned that we should interfere -

710
00:47:11,281 --> 00:47:12,919
- on seeing a gathering

711
00:47:13,014 --> 00:47:14,253
Did you understand?
So lets involve

712
00:47:14,313 --> 00:47:15,587
Come, there is no time
Look

713
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,726
Shall we not interfere
when there is an issue?

714
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,258
Will beat you, when there is no
issue, we should create one, fellow

715
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:22,758
We should create and then interfere
that is what we politicians are

716
00:47:22,812 --> 00:47:25,486
Do you think that all this issues
have sprouted automatically?

717
00:47:25,646 --> 00:47:27,750
All these are created by people
who are sitting on top of us

718
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:29,754
That is the reason why its easy for
them to solve, did you understand?

719
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:31,822
Marvellous
You understood it

720
00:47:31,945 --> 00:47:34,050
You are smart, you will
reach higher and higher

721
00:47:34,145 --> 00:47:36,215
But don't go above
this, I'll pull you down!

722
00:47:37,577 --> 00:47:39,614
Now, start looking on
me, come here I say

723
00:47:39,677 --> 00:47:41,553
Where did sir get this much
intelligence? - That's all there

724
00:47:41,676 --> 00:47:43,121
Food first, look at his
face, he is too hungry

725
00:47:43,243 --> 00:47:44,813
That's not the truth
Come, lets eat

726
00:47:45,243 --> 00:47:49,918
Stop, mother they are coming with
hunger will eat you won't consider age

727
00:47:50,675 --> 00:47:52,154
Greetings
Greetings

728
00:47:52,508 --> 00:47:54,249
Boys have come to eat
Everything is there, no?

729
00:47:54,608 --> 00:47:55,813
Come on get in and have food

730
00:47:56,741 --> 00:47:59,585
No need to hang this banana now
Then?

731
00:47:59,707 --> 00:48:00,685
Could have hanged it
after getting it ripe

732
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:03,150
Is it so? -Again it can
be used as fire-wood

733
00:48:03,873 --> 00:48:04,715
Come, come

734
00:48:15,905 --> 00:48:18,748
So all have ate well is it?
Really ate well

735
00:48:18,904 --> 00:48:20,941
Such kind of business
happens once in a while only

736
00:48:21,104 --> 00:48:23,811
Do you want the bill?
Bill, for me?

737
00:48:23,937 --> 00:48:26,076
Why should I need bill?
When paying the money

738
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:28,116
For big amounts
people will ask for bill

739
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:30,181
My goodness, Thankachan sir
has said in particular-

740
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:32,579
- after the class the
kids should eat from here only

741
00:48:32,669 --> 00:48:35,240
Then what about the money?
This is practical class

742
00:48:35,502 --> 00:48:38,744
How to eat without paying after
a strike has taught the boys -

743
00:48:38,801 --> 00:48:39,939
- who studies politics

744
00:48:40,134 --> 00:48:43,081
Pay my money there is no
sort of politics over here

745
00:48:43,135 --> 00:48:45,546
My goodness, all that will reach
here that's why I'm send here -

746
00:48:45,667 --> 00:48:47,237
- <i>by Ganapathy Pilla
and Thankachan sir</i>

747
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,274
The next class is on, how
to pelt stones on a bus

748
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,636
Now, should that be started
from here - No, no need

749
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,745
Just go from here, that's enough
That is smartness

750
00:48:54,899 --> 00:48:55,775
Should be like that

751
00:48:56,266 --> 00:49:00,213
Hey fellow, Brittas, my money is lost
Gone!

752
00:49:15,896 --> 00:49:18,638
Hey fellow Arjun
You here?

753
00:49:18,763 --> 00:49:20,571
I'm here its been 3 weeks

754
00:49:20,662 --> 00:49:22,198
You?
This is my native place

755
00:49:22,295 --> 00:49:24,707
Are you living here?
Hats off to you

756
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:26,902
How come you are here?
Farming?

757
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:29,741
Should meet BDO,
there are some matters

758
00:49:29,894 --> 00:49:32,738
She is a strict type
BDO is my pal

759
00:49:32,861 --> 00:49:34,771
Come, we are staying
in the same house

760
00:49:34,893 --> 00:49:36,770
You tell the matter,
what is the issue? I'll deal it

761
00:49:36,927 --> 00:49:39,965
That is bit complicated, one Karthi
he is the one who creates hurdles

762
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:43,765
Yeah, Karthi the guy
with farming and all? - Yes

763
00:49:44,126 --> 00:49:47,505
Do you know him?
Don't I know him! Best!

764
00:49:49,558 --> 00:49:52,869
Hello, BDO-ji
Anu, there is an inspection

765
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,528
Came to go for that one

766
00:49:54,623 --> 00:49:56,466
Yeah, don't you know?
He is my close friend

767
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:58,001
We studied together
during the degree

768
00:49:58,124 --> 00:50:00,070
I've told, BDO is my close friend

769
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:01,792
Come on man, tell is it
'Thekapadam or Vadakepadam?'

770
00:50:01,922 --> 00:50:03,924
No that is..
Please Arjun, not possible

771
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:09,903
No, look this is my..
Friendship and duty is different

772
00:50:10,588 --> 00:50:13,068
I won't give the report
saying that land is polluted

773
00:50:13,788 --> 00:50:16,700
Thinking that is the procedure,
that's why came as a request

774
00:50:16,887 --> 00:50:19,834
Now I know what to do, before
vacating 'Vadakepadam'

775
00:50:19,921 --> 00:50:21,628
Going to vacate this office, initially

776
00:50:21,754 --> 00:50:24,734
I'll bring the JCB and ride
over the office and officer

777
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,163
One Karthi and his lot of fans

778
00:50:31,285 --> 00:50:32,992
I'll show how to put down the hero

779
00:50:33,185 --> 00:50:36,223
No, no matter how much trying to
justify that as far as I'm concerned

780
00:50:36,552 --> 00:50:37,689
That was an insult

781
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:40,025
Insuk?
It was to save you

782
00:50:40,218 --> 00:50:43,256
This 'Vadakepadam' is.. -Even if its
'Vadakepadam or Thekepadam'

783
00:50:43,584 --> 00:50:46,063
This Agricultural Officer can
also do something and all

784
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:48,562
I'll report, there is a negative
content in the soil out here

785
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:51,653
Truly, I feel sympathy towards you

786
00:50:51,849 --> 00:50:53,886
You can't realise the people

787
00:50:54,116 --> 00:50:57,097
This person named Karhti"
I don't want to hear anything about him

788
00:50:57,216 --> 00:51:00,196
No need, one day you'll
have to listen to that

789
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,053
Don't stop the narration of
the tale, its very nice to hear

790
00:51:07,214 --> 00:51:09,956
Started the efforts to snatch the
'Vadakepadam', then?

791
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:14,755
Then, in the vital area of incidents
On this very region

792
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:18,587
A very important character
in this story comes

793
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:21,555
Who is that?
Wilson Puthuppali

794
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:22,215
Who is that?

795
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:25,985
Don't you know Wilson Puthuppali?
No

796
00:51:26,111 --> 00:51:31,220
Being a media person don't know
the great Wilson Puthuppali?

797
00:51:31,277 --> 00:51:32,085
Honestly, I don't know

798
00:51:32,277 --> 00:51:34,483
Enough of storytelling and all

799
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:36,754
Hello, just say who that
person is and go

800
00:51:37,576 --> 00:51:40,488
Dear"
..'Perumal Desham compatriots'

801
00:51:40,809 --> 00:51:41,947
On this day today-

802
00:51:42,109 --> 00:51:46,080
- our village's history is going
to be written on golden words

803
00:51:46,242 --> 00:51:49,688
In our village a think tank
named Pala Thankachan

804
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:51,651
Has already sowed
the seeds of politics

805
00:51:52,874 --> 00:51:56,980
For that seed to sprout, that
great person is on the way -

806
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:59,144
-with some water and manure

807
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,186
He is not simply a great person, at
SACC Convention held at 'Chicago'

808
00:52:02,472 --> 00:52:04,918
Between unknown nations

809
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,884
Has gone to represent
India, to speak without limits

810
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:10,984
Straight away from the airport

811
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,674
By receiving the felicitations
of Iakhs of people

812
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:16,115
On an open
vehicle, Puthupali Willson

813
00:52:16,237 --> 00:52:17,875
Here, is on his way

814
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,947
Puthupali Willson Ki..Jai
(Greetings to Puthupali Willson)

815
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,844
By receiving the felicitations
of Iakhs of people

816
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:22,947
On an open vehicle

817
00:52:23,069 --> 00:52:28,678
Puthupali Willson Ki..Jai
(Greetings to Puthupali Willson)

818
00:52:33,702 --> 00:52:34,976
Got scared

819
00:52:35,735 --> 00:52:38,578
Only one cracker
The tyre is out

820
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:40,544
What is this man?

821
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:49,515
Acclaims to all, hello
brother hope you are fine

822
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,042
If not what?
Was not required

823
00:52:52,998 --> 00:52:55,911
What is this red, are you a
communist? - No, Velichappadu(oracle)

824
00:52:56,065 --> 00:52:57,543
But right now its difficult

825
00:52:57,731 --> 00:52:58,903
Really difficult
Go man

826
00:52:59,797 --> 00:53:02,209
Careful, slowly

827
00:53:11,095 --> 00:53:14,008
When ladies are there, gentlemen
like you will be there, no?

828
00:53:14,196 --> 00:53:14,799
Will be there

829
00:53:16,262 --> 00:53:20,676
Friends, for the last few days

830
00:53:20,961 --> 00:53:23,532
In the various regions of this state

831
00:53:23,728 --> 00:53:28,142
I'm a person who had to participate
on 16 emergency natured meetings

832
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:31,605
Whose funeral was it?
On 16 emergency natured meetings

833
00:53:31,727 --> 00:53:32,568
Yeah, like that

834
00:53:33,092 --> 00:53:36,039
In between this in the Athingal
areal had to participate -

835
00:53:36,126 --> 00:53:38,572
On inauguration under the
name of a 'Kudumbasree' unit

836
00:53:38,659 --> 00:53:40,695
In an organic farm

837
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:43,068
Over there I was struck by a Cobra

838
00:53:43,192 --> 00:53:46,195
Nothing happened? - Its an organic
farm, no? It had no poison

839
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:47,935
The Cobra
That Cobra might have died

840
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:52,095
No, go on talk
By saying my physical issues

841
00:53:52,257 --> 00:53:54,202
My throat is not fine, by saying this

842
00:53:54,456 --> 00:53:56,800
I'm not spoiling your
and mine precious time

843
00:53:57,123 --> 00:53:59,535
I'm only reminding one thing

844
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:00,599
Listen carefully

845
00:54:00,722 --> 00:54:03,999
Famous German literary
person Nicolas Cage

846
00:54:04,222 --> 00:54:09,534
On his book 'Annotations are the
mere botheration of nations'

847
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:10,792
Should have studied
when sending to school

848
00:54:10,921 --> 00:54:12,867
There is a book like that, its there

849
00:54:12,988 --> 00:54:14,933
On that book, its mentioned

850
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:19,000
In a land where the political
thoughts had not reached

851
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:24,159
Or the people who doesn't
have political inclinations

852
00:54:24,519 --> 00:54:27,523
All this is equal to animals

853
00:54:27,685 --> 00:54:28,958
Listen and learn

854
00:54:29,218 --> 00:54:32,688
Because of efforts of Ganapathy

855
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:38,994
Political thoughts are
coming into our society

856
00:54:39,217 --> 00:54:41,697
That's good
For its coming

857
00:54:41,817 --> 00:54:44,194
Friends we are waiting

858
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:49,861
Any moment he will
definitely come to our land

859
00:54:50,015 --> 00:54:55,055
Other than his coming, we have
no other way that's the truth

860
00:54:55,215 --> 00:54:56,488
Glory, praise the Lord

861
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,751
Glory?
For his arrival

862
00:54:58,914 --> 00:55:03,055
At this time, all of you
raise your hands to the top

863
00:55:03,213 --> 00:55:06,592
Friends pray vigorously

864
00:55:06,713 --> 00:55:08,886
Let the brother with
long hair free from sins

865
00:55:09,046 --> 00:55:13,619
Clap the hands, for his
arrival we are praying

866
00:55:13,712 --> 00:55:18,421
My people are there, there
are people to pardon my sins

867
00:55:19,544 --> 00:55:22,684
Raise your hands above and pray
Stop it man!

868
00:55:23,911 --> 00:55:25,014
Are you a pastor'?

869
00:55:25,877 --> 00:55:27,686
What?
Sorry -Go man

870
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:30,518
So it was Pala Thankachan
who brought Wilson Puthuppali

871
00:55:30,643 --> 00:55:33,521
Who was a pastor by engaging in
politics and taken to this native, is it?

872
00:55:33,709 --> 00:55:37,418
No, when Pala Thankachan
met him he was not a pastor

873
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:42,149
Then? - Like AR Rahman and
Illayaraja with music was yearning Iakhs

874
00:55:42,441 --> 00:55:43,818
A musician

875
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:53,515
Friends, two kidneys has failed

876
00:56:05,872 --> 00:56:08,181
Due to kidney failure
he was bedridden

877
00:56:08,504 --> 00:56:09,744
He withered in pain

878
00:56:20,036 --> 00:56:22,015
This is me, no?
Hey you!

879
00:56:24,568 --> 00:56:25,706
Tell the truth

880
00:56:25,868 --> 00:56:27,972
I'm a poor guy
Where did you get my photo?

881
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:29,838
I stole it from a studio

882
00:56:30,034 --> 00:56:31,206
Didn't you get anyone else's photo?

883
00:56:31,568 --> 00:56:33,104
Sir, no one looks like a
person with kidney failure

884
00:56:33,234 --> 00:56:35,873
Hey you - Its not like that, I'll say

885
00:56:36,066 --> 00:56:36,806
Then how is it?

886
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:38,810
Sir, people should
feel to give money, no?

887
00:56:38,933 --> 00:56:42,004
That aristocracy,
humanness on sir's face

888
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:47,480
Simplicity, grace, glamour because
of all this people give money

889
00:56:47,632 --> 00:56:48,803
Fellow, doesn't anyone
else have all this?

890
00:56:48,898 --> 00:56:51,105
No other person has got it
Its by birth

891
00:56:51,498 --> 00:56:53,876
Okay go fellow
Okay thank you sir

892
00:56:53,998 --> 00:56:54,976
Wait, wait

893
00:56:55,197 --> 00:56:57,700
Sir, don't take my money
This is collected in my name, no?

894
00:56:57,863 --> 00:57:00,776
Let it be with me -Sir have yearned
it by singing with hard work

895
00:57:00,897 --> 00:57:02,842
Who are you man? To yearn money
by singing, are you Yesudas?

896
00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:07,171
Go fellow, never again come with
such kinds of tricks - Sir, give money

897
00:57:07,529 --> 00:57:09,008
Go I say, go man

898
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:12,900
Fellow, stop, its a matter where
you can also get money

899
00:57:13,428 --> 00:57:15,430
Come here, come here I say

900
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:23,004
Do you know to preach?
Will do any filthy work for money

901
00:57:23,194 --> 00:57:26,504
I know that - Sir what do you want,
do you want ordinary preaching?

902
00:57:26,659 --> 00:57:27,763
Or you want fire band preaching?

903
00:57:27,893 --> 00:57:28,997
Each has got different rates

904
00:57:29,426 --> 00:57:30,904
Is there things like that?
Yeah, its there

905
00:57:31,892 --> 00:57:34,839
Rs. 20? This is only
for ordinary preaching

906
00:57:34,992 --> 00:57:37,699
No, from today onwards its
the rate for fire band preaching

907
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:39,804
Who fixed it?
I fixed it- From when?

908
00:57:39,991 --> 00:57:40,969
From today

909
00:57:41,724 --> 00:57:44,533
Suppose I don't preach for Rs.20?

910
00:57:44,723 --> 00:57:48,000
By putting your photo saying
your kidney has failed

911
00:57:48,156 --> 00:57:50,193
You'll have to sing
sitting in the wheel chair

912
00:57:50,523 --> 00:57:51,967
I'll preach
That is good

913
00:57:53,422 --> 00:57:57,871
Has asked for our 12 loads of snake
gourd and pumpkin to Pollachi

914
00:57:58,056 --> 00:57:59,398
Payment as to what is asked

915
00:57:59,588 --> 00:58:02,831
But I told no need of money after
lessening the load to regular clients

916
00:58:02,955 --> 00:58:06,629
<i>That was good - Have you given
the “st ta Keck“ and Gapahpuram'!?</i>

917
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,855
Yeah, has given

918
00:58:10,054 --> 00:58:13,694
Look, there is a team coming
from Delhi next week

919
00:58:14,053 --> 00:58:15,657
To study about us

920
00:58:15,986 --> 00:58:18,398
Which means to study
about our farming

921
00:58:18,686 --> 00:58:22,428
To learn about farming, should do
the farming and learn, I've told

922
00:58:22,652 --> 00:58:24,757
Anyway let them learn and go, no?

00:58:26,550 --> 00:58:28,962
Look there comes the person to
teach us -Madam there are ditches

924
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,592
That is the smell of cow dung,
that is why it stinks like this

925
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,164
If I wouldn't have got this job of
peon would have died working in field

926
00:58:41,715 --> 00:58:43,661
Would have killed the person

927
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:48,430
Look all of you stop this work for 5
minutes, madam is allergic to dust

928
00:58:48,614 --> 00:58:51,527
We are also allergic on seeing
people who are allergic to soil and dust

929
00:59:05,979 --> 00:59:10,688
Look a gazetted officer, scale of
pay is between 35,000 to 55,000

Agricultural Officer out here has
actively engaged in farming in here

934
00:59:23,809 --> 00:59:27,552
As per the advise of Agricultural
Officer, the farming has flourished

935
00:59:27,709 --> 00:59:29,052
Should send a report to government

936
00:59:29,209 --> 00:59:32,553
For that should require a sign from
the farmers over here, brother sign

937

Madam will get angry

From a jackfruit tree
a mango is drawn

00:59:53,639 --> 00:59:56,916
What all things like that, no?
Can you sign on the report or not?

01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:02,608
Don't think you can defeat me

01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:30,160
Sister just take everything as a fun

01:01:32,958 --> 01:01:36,461
Came to mow only but
that is not this mowing

976
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:40,670
Since they don't know the value
of this, they are all with you

977
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:44,936
I'll show you who this
Wilson Puthuppali is

978
01:01:46,156 --> 01:01:48,932
Friends in the acidity soil

01:01:49,089 --> 01:01:50,567
He has told that he'll say sorry

980
01:01:50,721 --> 01:01:52,701
Then my dog will mow the
place that is told by you

981
01:01:54,522 --> 01:01:55,967
Did the frog in the hole see
that there is no under wear?

982
01:01:56,088 --> 01:01:57,794
Fellow wearing the brown loin
cloth move off from the way

983
01:01:58,687 --> 01:02:03,726
Thankachan sir you remain cool,

984
01:02:04,653 --> 01:02:06,633
I'll deal with the things in here

985
01:02:07,786 --> 01:02:10,857
That is he tried to mow me today

986
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:12,396
And then did you mow?

987
01:02:12,519 --> 01:02:15,796
No, nothing happened,
to make my body sweat-

988
01:02:15,985 --> 01:02:18,794
- sun should rise at the
East and set at the West

989
01:02:18,984 --> 01:02:21,464
Whatever it is you
don't ruin my image

990
01:02:21,651 --> 01:02:24,393
Until I come make the things active

991
01:02:27,017 --> 01:02:30,988
What sir says is for few days I
should handle all the matters here

992
01:02:31,617 --> 01:02:32,720
Is there full?

993
01:02:33,782 --> 01:02:35,022
Full?
What?

994
01:02:35,382 --> 01:02:38,022
So don't you know the full and pint?

995
01:02:38,616 --> 01:02:43,360
Bottle, in politics the
bottle is very vital

996
01:02:43,848 --> 01:02:47,522
No, that is because ourfore
fathefs have made an agreement

997
01:02:47,647 --> 01:02:50,719
Long back, in this native
liquor is not allowed

998
01:02:50,947 --> 01:02:52,688
Should tell all this before

999
01:02:53,646 --> 01:02:55,387
Then okay

1000
01:02:55,546 --> 01:02:58,152
Sir, young boss who is ignorant
told as he doesn't know

1001
01:02:58,479 --> 01:03:00,014
We can flow liquor
Come on say, can flow liquor

1002
01:03:00,478 --> 01:03:05,154
Don't go sir -Those who yearn with
hard work generally will be honest

1003
01:03:05,512 --> 01:03:08,822
To lose their honesty,
the liquor should come

1004
01:03:08,977 --> 01:03:11,480
Along with money, those
who work by sweating

1005
01:03:11,677 --> 01:03:14,623
We should teach him to
yearn without any work

1006
01:03:14,776 --> 01:03:15,846
Everything can be made ready
Good, if so

1007
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:18,114
People of 'Perumal Desham'
should come after me

1008
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:19,411
Will come

1009
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:24,114
There is a mild quarrel between that
Karthi and Agricultural Officer

1010
01:03:24,475 --> 01:03:27,115
That quarrel should be made strong

1011
01:03:28,841 --> 01:03:30,445
Really deadly

1012
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:41,415
Exact sign

1013
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:44,944
Why are we collecting this
much sign and sending it?

1014
01:03:45,639 --> 01:03:48,552
To get my project approved
should get the sign of com patriots

1015
01:03:48,706 --> 01:03:53,450
That project has to be approved by
a tiger only then I can leave this place

1016
01:03:53,805 --> 01:03:56,876
In the world one of the top ten
Agricultural Professors

1017
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:59,611
Is a visiting professor
at Florida and Brazil

1018
01:03:59,770 --> 01:04:03,046
Now only informed that the
University has send the project to him

1019
01:04:03,169 --> 01:04:04,978
Has send the profile of sir

1020
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:01,472
Karthi, where is that person?

1021
01:05:01,628 --> 01:05:03,972
Again planning to make him busted
Tell where he is?

1022
01:05:04,128 --> 01:05:05,505
He is there in that field

1023
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:28,094
On seeing a crab?
Agricultural Officer is not bad

1024
01:05:32,491 --> 01:05:34,595
The fifth person in the world ranking

1025
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:38,902
What are you saying?
Ranking to whom?

1026
01:05:39,156 --> 01:05:41,135
Its you, for sure

1027
01:05:41,522 --> 01:05:44,469
Aren't you the Agricultural professor
at the University of Florida?

1028
01:05:46,388 --> 01:05:49,766
Visiting professor'? Something
wrong has happened to you

1029
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:54,460
No, visiting profesor at Florada
Agricultural University K.R Perumal

1030
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:56,463
Oh! That one, haven't you heard?

1031
01:05:56,753 --> 01:05:59,632
There will be 7 people in
this world with same face cut

1032
01:06:00,153 --> 01:06:02,393
Sometimes it'll be 10 or 15

1033
01:06:07,986 --> 01:06:12,934
Technically your project report
is good but it lacks passion

1034
01:06:13,751 --> 01:06:15,594
I've reported where it is

1035
01:06:15,751 --> 01:06:18,094
You correct that and
after that I'll sign it

1036
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:45,019
To be honest how lucky are
these compatriots, how lucky I'm

1037
01:06:46,446 --> 01:06:48,517
Wears a simple dress

1038
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:51,591
How in a simple way
has reviewed the project?

1039
01:06:53,012 --> 01:06:56,516
My god, what all things
did I say on that day?

1040
01:06:56,845 --> 01:06:59,984
Told to go out from the office,
asked whether he is educated?

1041
01:07:01,944 --> 01:07:05,413
Asked whether shinning, then
with police..-God, please, please.

1042
01:07:05,543 --> 01:07:06,920
Enough I don't want to hear

1043
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:29,079
Tell Dhamodar Ji
Come on tell Anu Dhamodar Ji

1044
01:07:30,874 --> 01:07:31,875
What?

1045
01:07:52,337 --> 01:07:53,407
For me..

1046
01:08:00,003 --> 01:08:02,448
Come on officer did you have food?

1047
01:08:05,802 --> 01:08:08,782
Asking the pardon without
knowing who and what

1048
01:08:09,034 --> 01:08:11,605
Like a big person
like sir, I told something

1049
01:08:11,734 --> 01:08:13,839
Its okay when big people
are bit hurted

1050
01:08:14,034 --> 01:08:16,570
But ordinary people
shouldn't be harassed

1051
01:08:18,433 --> 01:08:20,879
Sure, I'll definitely follow it

1052
01:08:21,433 --> 01:08:22,968
Sir once in a while should
come to office

1053
01:08:24,632 --> 01:08:26,612
That will be a big happiness
for all of us

1054
01:08:26,766 --> 01:08:27,801
That will be a motivation

1055
01:08:27,932 --> 01:08:31,674
But more motivation is that when
an Agricultural Officer comes to field

1056
01:08:31,865 --> 01:08:32,741
What we receive

1057
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:44,443
Told me to come to field,
today its holiday for Mary

1058
01:08:44,596 --> 01:08:45,836
I'll do all the cooking

1059
01:08:48,929 --> 01:08:50,908
YourAgricultural Officer
is really scared, no?

1060
01:08:51,595 --> 01:08:54,701
Anyway she has got a feel that she
has become an officer, that's sure

1061
01:08:54,828 --> 01:08:58,639
But its regarding the matter of office
don't know whether people needs it

1062
01:08:58,761 --> 01:09:00,968
Saying party and politics
some people have come

1063
01:09:01,094 --> 01:09:03,574
When good politics comes there
will be good changes,man

1064
01:09:03,761 --> 01:09:05,103
Father, that is when
good politics comes

1065
01:09:05,426 --> 01:09:07,599
How can good politics come
here when its boozing here?

1066
01:09:07,959 --> 01:09:08,994
Not only that

1067
01:09:09,393 --> 01:09:12,737
When our people are starved I
fear will they run for a drop of water

1068
01:09:12,925 --> 01:09:15,428
But any way we'll
approach in a positive way

1069
01:09:15,992 --> 01:09:17,903
You say father is there with you

1070
01:09:26,557 --> 01:09:28,935
Studied this in school, elephant
mahout of Poonthanam

1071
01:09:29,123 --> 01:09:32,501
Janapana -Whatever it is
what a philosophy

1072
01:09:32,622 --> 01:09:36,468
As it was written years back is it not
what happened to Thankachan sil's life?

1073
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,694
Getting the seat from the
party without knowing

1074
01:09:39,122 --> 01:09:44,002
Becoming a candidate, Thankachan sir
has become busy

1075
01:09:44,355 --> 01:09:46,334
What should we do with
the matter of Karthi?

1076
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:53,094
"We will do with the
Karthi, who goes higher"

1077
01:09:53,886 --> 01:09:56,332
Should squeeze the
peel of orange in his eyes

1078
01:09:56,819 --> 01:10:01,733
"The full which is seen
is made to vanish by God"

1079
01:10:02,552 --> 01:10:06,398
If this drought remains like this
people will die without water

1080
01:10:06,552 --> 01:10:08,656
While coming from house I
kept two bottles of water here

1081
01:10:10,551 --> 01:10:14,464
What is it?
All though you are angry with me

1082
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:16,960
I have real sympathy
towards you all

1083
01:10:17,116 --> 01:10:23,623
Right from the morning toils in the
field and enclosures on the dirt

1084
01:10:23,749 --> 01:10:25,729
Too bad
Getting income for that

1085
01:10:26,082 --> 01:10:27,755
Good income

1086
01:10:27,949 --> 01:10:30,485
How much is received?
750 to 800

1087
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:35,958
By toiling for 8 to 10 hours in the
sun on this field and enclosures

1088
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,651
For working, gets 750 to 800 rupees

1089
01:10:38,747 --> 01:10:40,886
Is it so? For one hour

1090
01:10:41,313 --> 01:10:45,818
Just one fourth of strain, will
give you thousand rupees

1091
01:10:49,678 --> 01:10:52,352
Chetta, you come
Chetta, you also come

1092
01:10:53,678 --> 01:10:56,590
Liquor and Biriyani to eat

1093
01:10:56,744 --> 01:10:58,621
Sir, tell the matters that
is going to happen

1094
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:04,652
Just take this, okay no
need if you don't want it

1095
01:11:04,810 --> 01:11:06,881
Chetta hold this

01:11:07,076 --> 01:11:10,057
Put it in that pocket

01:11:10,409 --> 01:11:13,787
Okay take it, this is only
an advance now do you trust?

01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:16,979
What are you thinking and
standing? Come on think

1099
01:11:17,308 --> 01:11:20,618
Son, turn on that AIC
let the farmers get chilled

1100
01:11:21,874 --> 01:11:25,685
Come here this can be
opened, you sit inside this

1101
01:11:26,106 --> 01:11:27,881
You think okay, revolutionist

1102
01:11:28,073 --> 01:11:30,019
Don't jam the fingers
put the leg inside

1103
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,712
Smell of a cow shed,
take the vehicle

1104
01:11:36,406 --> 01:11:40,046
Where are they going that
too along with him? -Don't know

1105
01:11:40,405 --> 01:11:42,783
Gave some money and took them

1106
01:11:42,938 --> 01:11:44,008
Money?

1107
01:11:49,003 --> 01:11:51,847
Karthietta, why can't we
beat that Wilson?

1108
01:11:52,404 --> 01:11:53,473
Who is that crying?

1109
01:11:53,636 --> 01:11:54,910
That is not crying and all

1110
01:11:55,502 --> 01:11:56,537
Some one over there

1111
01:12:00,035 --> 01:12:03,073
Karthietta, this Arjunan sir is great

1112
01:12:03,601 --> 01:12:07,446
Chetta, you hand over the field
to company, it'll be profitable

1113
01:12:07,567 --> 01:12:10,343
You scoundrel, drinking liquor from
there and you talk to Karthiettan

1114
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:11,537
Leave it
Come on touch and see

1115
01:12:11,634 --> 01:12:12,704
Will shed blood

1116
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,472
Come on, shed my blood

1117
01:12:14,566 --> 01:12:15,909
No need, come, come

1118
01:12:16,466 --> 01:12:20,437
Has come to rectify
the native playing with us

1119
01:12:21,665 --> 01:12:24,646
In the name of politics some
people simply to ruin

1120
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:38,735
Will there be one week holiday
during the harvesting festival

1121
01:12:38,963 --> 01:12:42,068
What is that?
Its the harvesting festival here

1122
01:12:42,529 --> 01:12:44,873
There will be music and dance

1123
01:12:45,296 --> 01:12:47,469
Last year it was on the day when
I took the charge over here

1124
01:12:47,695 --> 01:12:50,265
K.R. Perumal was
leading the dance

1125
01:12:50,395 --> 01:12:52,375
Danced? Karthi sir'?

1126
01:12:52,561 --> 01:12:56,975
Sir'? Hasn't he told he
should be called Karthi

1127
01:12:57,993 --> 01:13:00,405
Over here for everyone
he is Karthiettan

1128
01:13:00,893 --> 01:13:02,600
Here, just watch this one

1129
01:13:05,026 --> 01:13:08,735

1136
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:12,298
"Beloved, forgot to forget you"

1137
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:19,594
"Beautiful flower come
over the ridges of flower"

1138
01:14:20,348 --> 01:14:22,692
"Shall give my soul

1139
01:14:22,848 --> 01:14:25,954
"-come as husband and companion"

1140
01:14:50,577 --> 01:14:56,356
"A place in the name of truthfulness"

1141
01:14:57,077 --> 01:15:02,583
"Perumal Desham"

1142
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:18,847
“Kaveri in the eyes,
Saveri in the ears"

1143

"Lotus that bathes in the Brooke"

1144
01:15:25,372 --> 01:15:31,845
"On the smile of your lips
I'll fly like bee"

01:15:32,038 --> 01:15:37,680
"To hear that sound always,
my mind wafts in the breeze"

1146
01:15:38,004 --> 01:15:42,851

1153
01:16:37,596 --> 01:16:43,637
"Inside the casket that I hid in the
petal of flowers, I shall give it"

1154
01:16:43,828 --> 01:16:48,537
"Here comes a thousand dreams"

1155
01:16:50,527 --> 01:16:56,408
"Beautiful flower come
over the ridges of flower"

1156
01:16:56,693 --> 01:16:59,833
"Shall give my soul

01:17:00,026 --> 01:17:02,835
"-come as husband and companion"

01:17:03,058 --> 01:17:09,440

you blossomed in me"

1159
01:17:09,624 --> 01:17:14,004

01:17:15,656 --> 01:17:21,698
"Beautiful flower come
over the ridges of flower"

1161
01:17:22,722 --> 01:17:28,502
"Little bird come over the
ridges of clouds, beautiful one"

1162
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:37,024
Spoiled it, Mani should
put the ace first, is it?

1163
01:17:37,353 --> 01:17:40,857
Don't be angry you and this
person is learning the game, no?

1164
01:17:41,053 --> 01:17:42,726
Only by making mistakes
we can learn

1165
01:17:42,987 --> 01:17:44,988
Without drinking water
can we learn to swim?

1166
01:17:45,319 --> 01:17:45,820
That is not possible

1167
01:17:46,019 --> 01:17:50,990
When the thing is there don't take
it, push it when you get the chance

1168
01:17:51,318 --> 01:17:54,993
From tomorrow onwards I'll teach
you how to play cards with money

1169
01:17:55,285 --> 01:17:56,821
That will be more fun

1170
01:17:56,918 --> 01:17:58,521
Then I should make some money

1171
01:17:59,484 --> 01:18:01,691
Since the politics has entered here

1172
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,852
Along with it harthal
and strike will come

1173
01:18:03,984 --> 01:18:07,692
If you get a day of strike,
what will you do?

1174
01:18:10,383 --> 01:18:13,659
Will play cards
That is what I wanted to get

1175
01:18:13,882 --> 01:18:17,625
Simply to work and yearn
we are not Bengali or Tamilian

1176
01:18:17,748 --> 01:18:20,353
We are Malayalees, should learn to
make money by cheating people

1177
01:18:21,547 --> 01:18:22,958
Here comes Karthiettan

1178
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:30,656
You are all our parties
strong fighters-

1179
01:18:30,813 --> 01:18:34,350
- tomorrow you'll become
MP, MLA or ministers

1180
01:18:34,512 --> 01:18:36,321
People who should rule our nation

1181
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:41,951
People like that on seeing a person
getting up with fear then what's the use?

1182
01:18:42,244 --> 01:18:44,986
Don't play, go
Let them go

1183
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:48,382
What? -Don't go, play only
then can learn the game

1184
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:53,252
Sit, sit

1185
01:18:53,509 --> 01:18:55,489
In this gamejoker has got no role

1186
01:18:59,509 --> 01:19:02,489
John, Vinaya tomorrow
should mow eight fields

1187
01:19:02,675 --> 01:19:05,485
Like that run the tractor over
Solomen's and Majeed's fields

1188
01:19:05,675 --> 01:19:07,585
Can finish it on
starting it by morning six o clock

1189
01:19:07,707 --> 01:19:10,313
That is all there in this game

1190
01:19:11,341 --> 01:19:12,513
Karthietta, will come tomorrow

1191
01:19:12,674 --> 01:19:13,880
Its not possible tomorrow
and day after tomorrow

1192
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:17,885
Which means, look because of
these people our native is ruined

1193
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:19,809
You don't know the issues
which is going to come here

1194
01:19:19,973 --> 01:19:22,475
I saying for your betterment
Asking you as I don't know

1195
01:19:22,538 --> 01:19:24,484
What is wrong with you
if they have a good time?

1196
01:19:24,672 --> 01:19:26,549
I'm an outsider
I'll show you

1197
01:19:29,337 --> 01:19:32,978
Karthietta, till yesterday it was
cultivation and fields, now its better

1198
01:19:33,304 --> 01:19:34,647
Sim ply don't interfere on that

1199
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,810
Playing cards has come,
drinking liquor has come

1200
01:20:00,267 --> 01:20:02,304
Lackadaisical programs
on work has come

1201
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:05,647
Quarrels and difference
of opinion has come

1202
01:20:05,866 --> 01:20:09,837
Politically 'Perumal Desham'
lacks one more thing

1203
01:20:10,233 --> 01:20:11,643
What is that?

1204
01:20:15,332 --> 01:20:17,368
Harthal (strike)

1205
01:20:18,497 --> 01:20:23,378
Rice-gruel without salt and political
party without harthal is similar

1206
01:20:23,497 --> 01:20:25,305
There won't be any fun

1207
01:20:25,663 --> 01:20:30,339
The government land at
Vadakepadam is confiscated by Perumal

1208
01:20:30,496 --> 01:20:33,237
Saying that we'll conduct a harthal

1209
01:20:39,394 --> 01:20:43,900
No shop should be made to open,
office should not be working

1210
01:20:44,294 --> 01:20:46,796
Not even a two-wheeler
should move on the road

1211
01:20:47,260 --> 01:20:50,764
If anyone acts against
this we can slap and hit

1212
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:54,267
What if, if we want to take the car?

1213
01:20:54,492 --> 01:20:56,995
All this is not applicable to organisers

1214
01:20:57,326 --> 01:20:59,999
This should be effected
to ordinary peoples lives

1215
01:21:00,325 --> 01:21:01,827
So without fear can
pelt stones at the vehicle

1216
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:04,336
To tell the truth on hearing all
this goosebumps are coming

1217
01:21:05,624 --> 01:21:08,627
Like liquor harthal should
be an intoxication

1218
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:12,328
People should keep
waiting for the next harthal

1219
01:21:12,557 --> 01:21:15,469
On hearing all this my eyes
gets filled out of happiness

1220
01:21:15,656 --> 01:21:17,795
Once the harthal is over
will my son become a leader?

1221
01:21:18,322 --> 01:21:19,232
Why not?

1222
01:21:23,588 --> 01:21:24,760
Shucks!

1223
01:21:27,987 --> 01:21:29,591
Willson what are you doing?

1224
01:21:30,954 --> 01:21:37,928
This is not a villain in a serial, a
politician should change the costumes

1225
01:21:43,685 --> 01:21:47,656
The big festival, harthal which
is celebrated in the native

1226
01:21:47,852 --> 01:21:50,559
For the time it has reached
in our 'Perumal Desham'

1227
01:21:50,684 --> 01:21:55,792
From morning 6 o'clock to evening
6o'clock the harthal by PDVP

1228
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:58,453
By closing the shops and
by immobilising the offices

1229
01:21:58,616 --> 01:22:00,596
Requesting to make it a success

1230
01:22:00,783 --> 01:22:06,733
The harthal is declared against
Perumal family for holding govt. land

1231
01:22:06,982 --> 01:22:10,827
Requesting to make this
harthal a big event

1232
01:22:10,981 --> 01:22:14,292
Pray and bless and vandalise

1233
01:22:14,514 --> 01:22:16,618
Mothers and sisters.

1234
01:22:16,980 --> 01:22:21,622
When I was away from this place for
a day, the entire outlook is changed

1235
01:22:23,347 --> 01:22:27,260
Changed -From morning 6o'clock
to evening 6 o'clock

1236
01:22:27,479 --> 01:22:29,322
The harthal declared by PVDP

1237
01:22:35,611 --> 01:22:37,284
His mother's sack, move off man

1238
01:22:38,310 --> 01:22:40,790
Hey Brittas
Now what to do? Ordered tea also

1239
01:22:41,344 --> 01:22:45,189
His tea shop, go man
Don't beat

1240
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,958
Catch him on the harthal day
opening the shop, no?

1241
01:22:53,442 --> 01:22:55,513
Will close it, come here

1242
01:22:56,908 --> 01:23:01,219
Closing the shops,
troubling the compatriots

1243
01:23:01,641 --> 01:23:05,611
While doing all this it is a very big
pleasure for our mind, no?

1244
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:11,452
Yes, yes -When other guys cafs
glass was smashed, I was so happy

1245
01:23:11,606 --> 01:23:14,449
Poor fellow has taken it on C.C
Now on no need to pay C.C

1246
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,414
Vehicle should be there to repay

1247
01:23:16,605 --> 01:23:20,780
What I'm thinking is since all these
years there was no harthal in our native

1248
01:23:20,905 --> 01:23:22,646
How sad it is

1249
01:23:22,838 --> 01:23:25,717
Again there will be lot of harthals,
we'll celebrate it also

1250
01:23:25,904 --> 01:23:30,613
No natives should be
allowed to live happily

1251
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:35,711
Wait, wait a prey for us has come
we will start the harthal, no?

1252
01:23:36,936 --> 01:23:43,443
Will block, will block
Get down fellow

1253
01:23:43,568 --> 01:23:45,809
What is it? - On the harthal day
will take the vehicle,no?

1254
01:23:46,235 --> 01:23:47,611
What is the matter?

1255
01:23:48,234 --> 01:23:50,976
Get down, you fellow
I came to take the load of Karthiettan

1256
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,176
Vegetable load

1257
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,539
If you come to take the vegetable
load, you will be set on flame

1258
01:23:54,699 --> 01:23:56,872
How dare you take vegetables
from 'Perumal Desham'

1259
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,877
You take that stone and
wood to block the road

1260
01:23:59,199 --> 01:24:00,769
Only then the harthal will look good

1261
01:24:04,298 --> 01:24:05,834
Now take the stone

1262
01:24:06,498 --> 01:24:08,341
At least on today do some work

1263
01:24:08,532 --> 01:24:11,171
Fellow, stop the vehicle,
where are you going? -What's the matter?

1264
01:24:11,464 --> 01:24:13,569
Harthal?
Where are you going?

1265
01:24:24,296 --> 01:24:26,537
Ram esha, you take the
vehicle, I'll clear the block

1266
01:24:26,729 --> 01:24:29,471
Karthietta, we are going
back, we can't bear this

1267
01:24:29,628 --> 01:24:32,666
Hey Madhu, what are you doing?
Are you so insolent to ruin this native?

1268
01:24:32,961 --> 01:24:36,238
Madhu, if at all once the load is
cancelled then they won't come here

1269
01:24:36,395 --> 01:24:38,738
If they won't come,
nothing to me go man

1270
01:24:38,893 --> 01:24:42,306
What is he saying?- We aren't so
desperate to sell vegetables and live

1271
01:24:42,427 --> 01:24:47,466
Karthietta, we are going back
Ramesha, you will drive over me

1272
01:24:47,626 --> 01:24:51,732
That is what we also want, for
our harthal we will get a martyr

1273
01:24:51,925 --> 01:24:53,927
Only then the harthal will be success

1274
01:24:54,258 --> 01:24:57,364
I'll be a martyr, fellow
No, leave it

1275
01:24:57,558 --> 01:24:58,968
Go man

1276
01:25:02,191 --> 01:25:07,902
Harthal is success, we'll im mobilise

1277
01:25:08,223 --> 01:25:14,195
'Perumal Desham' is immobilised
Harthal is success, we'll immobilise

1278
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:16,928
Now we'll vandalise all
the shops at the junction

1279
01:25:17,255 --> 01:25:18,393
So, don't we have to shut
down the Agriculture Office?

1280
01:25:18,455 --> 01:25:19,660
That is looked after by
Bhagavathar and team

1281
01:25:19,887 --> 01:25:23,630
Long live PVDP, make it success

1282
01:25:23,887 --> 01:25:27,732
Long live PDVP
Long live harthal

1283
01:25:29,853 --> 01:25:32,958
Get down fellows, mothers
no need of looking

1284
01:25:33,285 --> 01:25:35,265
Today is harthal, close everything

1285
01:25:36,185 --> 01:25:41,224
Arjunan sir, leader lead on boldly

1286
01:25:41,318 --> 01:25:44,561
What is that commotion?
5 to 8..-No, Iakhs!

1287
01:25:44,751 --> 01:25:49,756
Lakhs are behind you

1288
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:51,591
Madam, its the harthal on 'Vadakepadam' issue

1289
01:25:51,684 --> 01:25:53,391
The first harthal in this native

1290
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:54,928
We'll close the office and join in that

1291
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:56,660
What harthal after
closing down the office?

1292
01:25:56,849 --> 01:25:59,455
Lakhs and Iakhs are behind!

1293
01:25:59,616 --> 01:26:01,617
Just move back, my hand will be
trapped inside the moustache

1294
01:26:02,248 --> 01:26:04,421
Fellow, don't you know
today is harthal? - No

1295
01:26:04,615 --> 01:26:05,889
It has come to our native place also

1296
01:26:06,215 --> 01:26:08,922
The national festival-harthal
go and celebrate it, fellow

1297
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:12,386
What to celebrate?
Simply gawking go man

1298
01:26:12,780 --> 01:26:14,282
Do I have to tell you separately?

1299
01:26:17,780 --> 01:26:20,590
What is going on here?
Madam, didn't you know?

1300
01:26:20,846 --> 01:26:24,190
Vascodi Gama has come to India

1301
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:25,882
Why are you nodding,
did you know?

1302
01:26:27,779 --> 01:26:30,759
Madam, don't you know today is
harthal, came to close this office

1303
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:33,754
To close the office? If its
any harthal can't close the office

1304
01:26:33,944 --> 01:26:35,184
Hey you girl, won't you close it?

1305
01:26:35,611 --> 01:26:38,352
Is she your aunty's
daughter to call, you girl and all?

1306
01:26:38,610 --> 01:26:40,283
Will you close this office?

1307
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:55,288
Our dear leader

1308
01:26:55,475 --> 01:27:00,423
Lead on, lead on

1309
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:15,253
What office during harthal
Karthi, I'll stop his game by today

1310
01:27:15,438 --> 01:27:18,543
Man, don't you know who is Karthi,
in this country the most important

1311
01:27:18,670 --> 01:27:21,207
Close the office girl, she and her..
No, won't close the office

1312
01:27:21,337 --> 01:27:23,647
Not only that won't allow
to destroy this native place

1313
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,246
Telling you to move back

1314
01:27:28,603 --> 01:27:30,913
Here she comes,
only she was lacking

1315
01:27:32,369 --> 01:27:34,610
What is it? What is itAnu
what is the problem?

1316
01:27:34,835 --> 01:27:38,544
Look no need of your report on the
harthal day if you enter inside office

1317
01:27:38,668 --> 01:27:41,238
Will chop off your legs
Even if you chop off the head

1318
01:27:41,401 --> 01:27:42,379
I'll be present for the job

1319
01:27:42,467 --> 01:27:44,947
Come Anu -Catch her!
How dare you? Come here

1320
01:27:45,234 --> 01:27:48,146
Leave her
Leave her I say!

1321
01:28:00,931 --> 01:28:04,174
On the harthal day
anyone can beat anybody

1322
01:28:04,431 --> 01:28:07,673
For the time being don't stand
here will go, come on guys

1323
01:28:07,797 --> 01:28:12,212
Don't stand here till the police
comes and beats, telling to Arjunan sir

1324
01:28:15,529 --> 01:28:21,740
If harthal is continued will stop
taking vegetables from Perumalpuram

1325
01:28:21,895 --> 01:28:24,637
Says fruits and
vegetable association

1326
01:28:24,928 --> 01:28:28,602
The problem over here is not the
vegetable, but its a matter of respect

1327
01:28:28,894 --> 01:28:32,239
Why man didn't you go for work
today? -Today is party procession

1328
01:28:32,361 --> 01:28:35,239
Got one biriyani and Rs.1000

1329
01:28:35,459 --> 01:28:39,271
As you have party procession
once in a while you can eat biriyani

1330
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,536
I'm planning to join the procession

1331
01:28:52,757 --> 01:28:58,468
Rs.1000 and biriyani will close
down this shop and join PVDP

1332
01:28:58,590 --> 01:28:59,625
That is profitable

1333
01:29:15,754 --> 01:29:19,291
No seen them so far -K arthietta,
don't think they will come

1334
01:29:28,419 --> 01:29:31,831
Come -lts a work of 50
people, we with this 5 people?

1335
01:29:32,185 --> 01:29:34,893
Dear workers and compatriots

1336
01:29:35,185 --> 01:29:39,132
Today evening at 6 o'clock at
'Perumal Desham' central

1337
01:29:39,317 --> 01:29:41,820
A PDVP's political
evaluation meeting is held

1338
01:29:41,950 --> 01:29:44,362
All are invited

1339
01:29:44,617 --> 01:29:47,222
Do you know what is the
slogan of farmers at Thailand?

1340
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:49,385
If there are no men
boost up the vigour

1341
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,757
That is enough man,
come on guys go for it

1342
01:29:58,915 --> 01:30:02,361
Long live PDVP

1343

Fellow, there are
union people to interfere

1344
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,585

Our beloved leader,
come boldly and lead on

1352
01:31:08,439 --> 01:31:10,714
Boss, they are trying to
throw away our flags

1353
01:31:14,804 --> 01:31:17,875
Chettan come here
Go I say

1354
01:31:19,737 --> 01:31:22,343
Okay you come here

1355
01:31:23,369 --> 01:31:28,182
What is this?
Give it to me

1356
01:31:29,369 --> 01:31:34,181
Look, this is not 1000 or
2000, its one Iakh

1357
01:31:34,501 --> 01:31:39,108
After receiving this coming
with me happily or...!

1358
01:31:40,867 --> 01:31:44,746
Not telling to threaten you
you are all my brothers, no?

1359
01:31:45,232 --> 01:31:47,508
Sir, they are all poor people
won't you come with us?

1360
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:49,736
Won't you come?
They will come sir

1361
01:31:50,132 --> 01:31:54,170
Look Madhu from now on its Sethu
who is PDVP's block president

1362
01:31:54,398 --> 01:31:55,775
Great, then what about Shekarettan?

1363
01:31:56,131 --> 01:31:57,906
He is our area joint secretary

1364
01:31:59,297 --> 01:32:02,403
Shake hand and hold the flag

1365
01:32:02,564 --> 01:32:05,204
Hold it and stand with happiness
That's it

1366
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:08,209
So, today evening we are
making the meeting grant

1367
01:32:10,730 --> 01:32:11,470
Okay as said

1368
01:32:11,663 --> 01:32:18,841
Leader, Arjunan Pilla
lead on, lead on

1369
01:32:19,162 --> 01:32:24,304
Lakhs and Iakhs behind
you,Arjunan Pilla leader

1370
01:32:32,793 --> 01:32:35,398
As seen the big
wicks in a way it demands

1371
01:32:36,592 --> 01:32:40,664
The minister's P.A helped
I'm on my way from secretariat

1372
01:32:40,858 --> 01:32:43,202
Within two weeks can
execute the agreement

1373
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:46,505
Now on the first phase
of eviction will start tomorrow

1374
01:33:15,886 --> 01:33:18,230
What is that?
Will understand on reading the notice

1375
01:33:24,552 --> 01:33:25,860
What is this daughter'?

1376
01:33:27,785 --> 01:33:30,162
Grandma, this is the
notice to evict us

1377
01:33:30,351 --> 01:33:31,591
To evict?

1378
01:33:39,683 --> 01:33:45,633
Father what happened?
Son, don't know why

1379
01:33:46,316 --> 01:33:51,094
There is a discomfort in the mind,
a feeling some where am I failing?

1380
01:33:51,215 --> 01:33:54,389
As long as this Karthi is
there, father won't fail any where

1381
01:33:55,648 --> 01:33:59,652
When that poor people's shelter
is lost its equal to my failure, no?

1382
01:34:00,247 --> 01:34:04,752
Father, this 'Perumal Desham' and
people in here will never disdain father

1383
01:34:05,346 --> 01:34:06,290
True

1384
01:34:53,340 --> 01:34:58,516
This is government land, move
back don't we have to do our duty?

1385
01:34:58,772 --> 01:35:01,877
Stop it, try to understand
Why this commotion?

1386
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:05,185
All of you disperse
Listen all of you go back

1387
01:35:15,903 --> 01:35:18,076
What is this?
They are not allowing to measure

1388
01:35:18,236 --> 01:35:20,182
To measure what?
Tell to stop it

1389
01:35:21,169 --> 01:35:23,341
There is a complaint that, all
this are fabricated documents

1390
01:35:23,435 --> 01:35:27,349
As long as a complaint prevails,
can't start the construction works

1391
01:35:30,167 --> 01:35:33,444
Immediately stop all this
till a decree is obtained-

1392
01:35:33,601 --> 01:35:35,739
-can't start any construction works

1393
01:35:46,465 --> 01:35:49,775
Who has called this person
Sir don't know -It was me

1394
01:35:54,698 --> 01:35:59,339
I was the one who called collector
to avoid a tussle that was needed

1395
01:36:00,196 --> 01:36:03,336
Being in politics align to the side
where more money is obtained

1396
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:04,439
Got accustomed to it

1397
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:07,803
It doesn't mean that
Thankachan is soul less

1398
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,772
Anyway we don't
have the situation to -

1399
01:36:10,861 --> 01:36:13,808
- conduct a strike to
regain Vadakepadam

1400
01:36:14,194 --> 01:36:17,198
Because there is no
union or politics here

1401
01:36:17,495 --> 01:36:19,337
Under the government supervision

1402
01:36:19,527 --> 01:36:23,202
Only registered unions and
delegated people's representative can -

1403
01:36:23,327 --> 01:36:25,772
- participate in the
settlement discussions

1404
01:36:25,826 --> 01:36:27,533
Both of this are politicians

1405
01:36:27,659 --> 01:36:30,538
All this is done by that
Ganapathy Pilla and son

1406
01:36:32,325 --> 01:36:34,168
Now there is nothing to fear

1407
01:36:34,291 --> 01:36:38,137
Everything is done this
Thankachan's political influence

1408
01:36:38,358 --> 01:36:41,770
There are some helps
like this from politicians

1409
01:36:42,190 --> 01:36:45,637
You people hate
politics and politicians, no?

1410
01:36:47,356 --> 01:36:50,394
Anyway Thankachan has
started to think in a positive way

1411
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:51,591
HapPy

1412
01:36:55,155 --> 01:36:57,601
Because of you company's
reputation is damaged

1413
01:36:58,555 --> 01:37:01,728
Commotion, collector's stay
order we are not interested in all this

1414
01:37:02,154 --> 01:37:06,500
My M.D if collector's brings the stay
with the minister we'll vacate the stay

1415
01:37:06,687 --> 01:37:09,326
Over here a political
party is created for that

1416
01:37:09,653 --> 01:37:12,657
Our party will merge
with minister's party

1417
01:37:13,086 --> 01:37:15,588
That is not my concern,
one thing is evident

1418
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:17,754
This property belongs
to Perumal Pilla

1419
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:20,121
We don't have to argue on that

1420
01:37:20,619 --> 01:37:24,156
All the people in the
village will oppose Karthi -

1421
01:37:24,285 --> 01:37:26,526
- very soon he'll come to my path

1422
01:37:26,818 --> 01:37:29,730
My R.K sir there's nothing which
can't be gained through politics

1423
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:34,363
Very bad all this time
sided with Ganapathy Pilla

1424
01:37:34,517 --> 01:37:35,722
In the last moment Pala
Thankachan has changed the sides

1425
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:37,453
Don't talk nonsense

1426
01:37:37,582 --> 01:37:40,153
Leave it when its a story
viewers will have some doubts

1427
01:37:40,316 --> 01:37:41,522
I've asked that doubt

1428
01:37:41,716 --> 01:37:44,218
This Ganapathy Pilla's
intention wasn't that good

1429
01:37:44,382 --> 01:37:46,658
When the things became clear
Thankachan sir stood with truth

1430
01:37:46,815 --> 01:37:48,624
Don't call it game changer and all

1431
01:37:48,847 --> 01:37:50,258
So, that's the reason

1432
01:37:53,547 --> 01:37:58,461
Good, when this came to the
hand all most everything is sure

1433
01:37:58,613 --> 01:38:03,618
Father I've kept my promise,
now can't you praise my caliber'?

1434
01:38:04,312 --> 01:38:08,692
Time has not come
Pilla, can you give my share?

1435
01:38:09,312 --> 01:38:12,451
Will give man, first of all
evict people in Vadakepadam

1436
01:38:12,511 --> 01:38:14,787
And start the legal formalities

1437
01:38:15,111 --> 01:38:17,317
In all the offices
our men should reach

1438
01:38:17,410 --> 01:38:20,482
Cops were given more
than what is told

1439
01:38:23,343 --> 01:38:27,256
This fake deed of Vadakepadam is
gained by me through Thankachan

1440
01:38:28,309 --> 01:38:33,223
Similarly to evict all those
people there, should use him

1441
01:38:34,174 --> 01:38:37,747
To do the fakes must use a thief

1442
01:38:38,207 --> 01:38:40,084
That is intelligence
Good

1443
01:38:41,373 --> 01:38:44,183
Good intelligence if all this
takes place like this one

1444
01:38:44,340 --> 01:38:48,287
Hey you boss Pilla, you called
me to teach politics, I came

1445
01:38:48,806 --> 01:38:53,413
Did the work so well, but the
work which you are planning now

1446
01:38:53,538 --> 01:38:54,778
Thankachan is not
accustomed to that

1447
01:38:55,105 --> 01:38:57,608
But the gimmick which you
are doing to posses the -

1448
01:38:57,705 --> 01:39:00,685
- poor people's dwelling
at Vad akepadam

1449
01:39:00,870 --> 01:39:02,508
Thankachan won't support that

1450
01:39:02,671 --> 01:39:05,618
You don't talk more,
do what is said

1451
01:39:05,804 --> 01:39:09,478
What if not possible?
Then you'll know who Ganapathy Pilla is

1452
01:39:09,636 --> 01:39:10,740
Before you leave this place

1453
01:39:10,869 --> 01:39:13,610
This entire place doesn't
belong to you and your father

1454
01:39:13,735 --> 01:39:15,715
Other people also posses land here
Stop it man

1455
01:39:17,235 --> 01:39:20,272
Coming here after having
my food, barking on me?

1456
01:39:20,467 --> 01:39:23,243
Get out at this moment
Fellow, came for that only

1457
01:39:23,534 --> 01:39:26,515
I was late to know the
good heart of Perumal

1458
01:39:27,133 --> 01:39:32,549
I'm leaving from here by removing all
the dirt contained from 'Puthuval family'

1459
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,373
After leaving from here, should flee
never should be seen here in this native

1460
01:39:35,499 --> 01:39:37,570
If seen..
Get lost boy!

1461
01:39:37,732 --> 01:39:40,611
Thankachan, has started this
acting since 35 years ago

1462
01:39:40,732 --> 01:39:43,575
Not only teaching politics,
very well knows to play it

1463
01:39:44,198 --> 01:39:48,407
Father and son be prepared,
during bad times actions go wrong

1464
01:39:48,797 --> 01:39:50,242
Will show you also

1465
01:39:55,829 --> 01:39:57,433
Don't bite the teeth and break it

1466
01:40:05,261 --> 01:40:06,740
Things are going out of control

1467
01:40:07,328 --> 01:40:10,171
What's going out of
control Karthi don't be upset

1468
01:40:13,061 --> 01:40:15,063
Can't you take all
this as challenges?

1469
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:19,635
During the time when I joined here
I wanted to go from here at the earliest

1470
01:40:19,826 --> 01:40:24,467
But now I've decided I'm
not going anywhere from here

1471
01:40:24,625 --> 01:40:27,799
Whatever which is effected
on this native will also effect me

1472
01:40:34,157 --> 01:40:36,728
Is the shop about to close?

1473
01:40:37,723 --> 01:40:39,828
Thankachan, is it come in

1474
01:40:40,457 --> 01:40:43,199
Why isn't there vehicle
to Pala at night?

1475
01:40:43,323 --> 01:40:46,201
No more today, only in the morning

1476
01:40:46,422 --> 01:40:49,266
Till that time I'll stay here,
these facilities are enough

1477
01:40:49,622 --> 01:40:52,329
Not asking for a
shelter checks the facilities

1478
01:40:52,554 --> 01:40:54,363
Where you thrown out from there?

1479
01:40:54,855 --> 01:40:59,496
At last, that had happened,
only few days for election

1480
01:41:00,054 --> 01:41:03,627
Being such a condition, they did it to
me - Thankacha, that was for good

1481
01:41:04,153 --> 01:41:07,690
Again you don't side with those
cruels and harass innocent people

1482
01:41:08,053 --> 01:41:10,624
They are doing several
things by using you

1483
01:41:10,819 --> 01:41:14,789
I can understand that, never
has Perumal hurted anyone

1484
01:41:15,418 --> 01:41:18,490
That man's life is a big sacrifice

1485
01:41:19,151 --> 01:41:22,428
You don't harass Perumal for them

1486
01:41:31,816 --> 01:41:33,692
Poison in vegetables

1487
01:41:33,815 --> 01:41:37,194
3 loads of vegetables cultivated
with severe contents of pesticides

1488
01:41:37,315 --> 01:41:39,420
Authorities have taken into
custody at the boarder check post

1489
01:41:39,682 --> 01:41:42,628
The vegetables by using pesticides
which are banned in India

1490
01:41:42,814 --> 01:41:46,125
Was cultivated in Perumal Desham
at Karthika Raja Perumal's farm

1491
01:41:48,547 --> 01:41:51,118
As workers weren't available
<i>at</i> 'Perumal Desham'

1492
01:41:51,280 --> 01:41:54,783
Karthika Raja Perumal took
the short cut, says the police

1493
01:41:55,079 --> 01:41:58,754
May be so far it was
organic farming, no?

1494
01:41:59,112 --> 01:42:02,320
More workers are required,
this means mix and spray

1495
01:42:02,478 --> 01:42:05,322
That's all
This shouldn't be ignored

1496
01:42:05,478 --> 01:42:07,389
He has created a bad
name for our native

1497
01:42:15,476 --> 01:42:17,387
No need, stop there

1498
01:42:18,642 --> 01:42:22,021
Perumal, I've come to
take Karthi, co-operate

1499
01:42:22,242 --> 01:42:25,223
That pesticide issue don't
you know all that? Yes, I know

1500
01:42:25,308 --> 01:42:29,051
Everything is known
not only to me you also know it

1501
01:42:30,341 --> 01:42:33,288
On the basis of proof,
we should take Karthi

1502
01:42:33,374 --> 01:42:35,445
There is another evidence
to show he hasn't done that

1503
01:42:35,541 --> 01:42:37,178
Do you know what it is?
Trust

1504
01:42:37,340 --> 01:42:40,344
The trust towards him by these
compatriots, that proof is enough

1505
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,448
No need father
Karthi, get inside the jeep

1506
01:42:45,605 --> 01:42:47,448
Then I'll also
come, we both together

1507
01:42:47,539 --> 01:42:50,314
Father fear not, nothing
will happen to me

1508
01:42:50,671 --> 01:42:53,117
Father always used to
say, no? Only truth will win

1509
01:42:53,204 --> 01:42:56,344
This time also we'll win - Son Karthi
Father you don't come to police station

1510
01:42:56,471 --> 01:42:59,451
Not only that more pitiful
than arresting me

1511
01:42:59,537 --> 01:43:02,074
Father plight in saving me
pleading with police and court

1512
01:43:04,669 --> 01:43:05,443
Shall we go?

1513
01:43:24,301 --> 01:43:28,271
At last when the things get over
everything which is told should reach

1514
01:43:37,832 --> 01:43:40,607
Tell the matter
Came to take Karthi on bail

1515
01:43:40,731 --> 01:43:42,540
Karthi?
Which Karthi?

1516
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:48,269
Is there anyone named
Karthi who is taken on custody?

1517
01:43:48,363 --> 01:43:50,400
No, sir, for them might
have gone wrong with the station

1518
01:43:50,596 --> 01:43:53,542
Karthika raja Perumal, who was
taken on custody yesterday by you

1519
01:43:54,029 --> 01:43:57,374
Sir, don't simply play drama
Has heard Chera Perumal

1520
01:43:57,462 --> 01:43:59,442
Man, who is this
Karthika Raja Perumal?

1521
01:43:59,529 --> 01:44:01,701
This person which you say
is not taken into custody, no?

1522
01:44:01,794 --> 01:44:04,104
Check the register
Understood

1523
01:44:04,228 --> 01:44:06,174
Its a harassment without
registering the case, no?

1524
01:44:06,294 --> 01:44:07,636
How much money did
thatArjunan Pilla give?

1525
01:44:07,793 --> 01:44:12,401
Lawyer has come to the point,
its true I shouldn't be honest

1526
01:44:12,526 --> 01:44:14,471
Its a deal which is good for us also

1527
01:44:14,626 --> 01:44:17,129
Give that Vadakepadam
to J.K group

1528
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:18,464
Perumal will be given double price

1529
01:44:18,625 --> 01:44:21,231
Commission or broker
fees, we'll get a fat pay

1530
01:44:21,425 --> 01:44:22,563
Including us

1531
01:44:23,458 --> 01:44:26,337
Othenlvise I'll charge 302 act

1532
01:44:26,491 --> 01:44:29,334
On agreeing for the deal,
I'll release him now itself

1533
01:44:29,457 --> 01:44:31,562
With 4 or 5 workers
I'll write the F.l.R

1534
01:44:33,023 --> 01:44:35,264
Tell fast
First Karthi should be seen

1535
01:44:37,189 --> 01:44:40,227
Truly speaking on hearing
bribe, I used to get angry

1536
01:44:40,322 --> 01:44:42,063
Now I also got the
benefits of this native

1537
01:44:42,256 --> 01:44:45,395
Politics, harthal, boozing
procession, cards all has come here

1538
01:44:46,088 --> 01:44:48,125
Then let there be bribe also

1539
01:45:02,086 --> 01:45:03,360
Did they?

1540
01:45:05,452 --> 01:45:06,453
Nothing

1541
01:45:07,585 --> 01:45:10,122
Mr. Inspector, you have
purposefully..

1542
01:45:10,285 --> 01:45:14,630
Leave it sir, like we toil on
soil, he toiled on our body

1543
01:45:14,785 --> 01:45:17,628
Look happened is happened
now we can discuss on the deal

1544
01:45:18,450 --> 01:45:19,588
Will talk

1545
01:45:22,049 --> 01:45:23,153
This is the deal

1546
01:45:23,383 --> 01:45:24,520
Its inside this one

1547
01:45:30,082 --> 01:45:32,186
Perumal, come to my
terms like that

1548
01:45:32,314 --> 01:45:36,262
Couldn't you have thought
about this before? Okay then

1549
01:45:36,648 --> 01:45:39,127
Soon after the registration process

1550
01:45:39,247 --> 01:45:42,057
By the next moment
I'll hand over Karthi at home

1551
01:45:45,746 --> 01:45:48,056
Father Perumal is surrendered

1552
01:45:50,712 --> 01:45:53,715
Inspector, as per
what we've planned

1553
01:45:55,445 --> 01:45:57,584
What man is he saying comedy?

1554
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:12,249
Arjuna, not comedy now
the things are bit serious

1555
01:48:03,560 --> 01:48:06,267
Pesticide case at
'Perumal Desham' on a new path

1556
01:48:06,392 --> 01:48:09,373
The culprit is revealed,
the news in detail

1557
01:48:09,559 --> 01:48:14,564
The newly formed PDVP's leader
Arjunan Pilla is behind it

1558
01:48:14,725 --> 01:48:17,001
The solid visual proofs for
that, we are exposing that

1559
01:48:18,258 --> 01:48:20,203
Before the investigating officers

1560
01:48:20,291 --> 01:48:24,000
Agricultural Officer has submitted the
C.D, the visuals you see is from that

1561
01:48:35,589 --> 01:48:37,762
How shocking it is?
What ducks?

1562
01:48:38,055 --> 01:48:42,230
Not that, this is what is said for
people who do good, says God is there

1563
01:48:42,354 --> 01:48:43,731
Do you know what is
the name of God? -What?

1564
01:48:43,987 --> 01:48:47,696
Wilson Puthuppali
Not at all ashamed to boost you

1565
01:48:48,487 --> 01:48:51,559
Do you know what is the
important thing in the world?

1566
01:48:51,986 --> 01:48:55,125
Oxygen
No, hidden camera

1567
01:48:55,586 --> 01:48:58,294
That is the thing
Correct

1568
01:48:58,452 --> 01:49:03,127
We channel people how many tigers
were turned into rats using hidden camera

1569
01:49:04,218 --> 01:49:07,995
We knew thatArjunan Pilla will
give a deadly task against Karthi

1570
01:49:08,218 --> 01:49:13,291
I and him had guessed it also, that's
how I and him planned hidden camera

1571
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:19,289
Look from where did you learn
all this? -It was you, no?

1572
01:49:19,716 --> 01:49:24,061
Had send a bathing scene in watts
up named Mallu aunty's bath scene

1573
01:49:24,282 --> 01:49:26,387
I was the one who had shot all that

1574
01:49:27,081 --> 01:49:29,721
But not inside bitter gourd
it was inside a soap box

1575
01:49:30,147 --> 01:49:33,617
Hats off to shrewdness of politicians

1576
01:49:34,414 --> 01:49:37,724
Then by the way our
Arjunan Pilla got arrested, no?

1577
01:49:38,246 --> 01:49:40,226
Then later what had
happened to com patriots?

1578
01:49:40,579 --> 01:49:42,354
Got dumped!

1579
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:46,593
Who is peeping while bathing?
Sat here to tell the story

1580
01:49:46,779 --> 01:49:49,350
Her bath has got 14 lakhs
likes, still she is shy

1581
01:49:51,211 --> 01:49:53,714
As Arjunan Pilla was
arrested the politics is over

1582
01:49:53,977 --> 01:49:56,981
Workers failed to get the
money for shouting the slogans

1583
01:49:57,178 --> 01:49:59,179
Compatriots were aloof from farming

1584
01:49:59,376 --> 01:50:01,413
With that all the
fields and enclosures-

1585
01:50:01,543 --> 01:50:03,955
- went dry at 'Perumal Desham'

1586
01:50:04,210 --> 01:50:07,554
Cultivation was ruined many houses
were under clutches of poverty

1587
01:50:09,275 --> 01:50:13,347
Sitting and smoking - Mother
hungry isn't the food ready?

1588
01:50:13,574 --> 01:50:17,021
Ask him, this is what monkey
does when getting a garland

1589
01:50:17,141 --> 01:50:22,021
Destroyed a native the fire-heath
was burning 3 times its all out

1590
01:50:22,240 --> 01:50:25,244
By sweating the body health
was there now certain sickness

1591
01:50:25,407 --> 01:50:27,716
That is also started
People are mad here

1592
01:50:28,072 --> 01:50:30,552
Give some peace of mind
Who has ruined peace of mind?

1593
01:50:31,372 --> 01:50:35,217
What glory it was to see going
outwith spade in the morning

1594
01:50:35,405 --> 01:50:37,385
At that time on attending a
procession will get biriyani

1595
01:50:37,438 --> 01:50:39,384
Will get money on hourly basis

1596
01:50:39,505 --> 01:50:41,643
Now nothing is there

1597
01:50:42,004 --> 01:50:45,542
The leader is in jail and leader's
father Ganapathy Pilla is missing

1598
01:50:45,737 --> 01:50:49,548
Now the farming is also lost, earlier
what did Karthiettan used to say?

1599
01:50:49,703 --> 01:50:53,515
While taking farming classes,
should work for our well being

1600
01:50:53,636 --> 01:50:55,672
Do not beg before others

1601
01:50:55,969 --> 01:50:59,382
Should cultivate the rice and
vegetables for this native here itself

1602
01:50:59,602 --> 01:51:02,946
Father tell Karthiettan to
start the farming like before

1603
01:51:03,268 --> 01:51:05,475
Earlier it was so nice to
see the fields and all

1604
01:51:12,067 --> 01:51:16,640
Here there is no farming and
workers then why is this kept open?

1605
01:51:17,132 --> 01:51:20,739
Close it will decide
later when to open it

1606
01:51:21,166 --> 01:51:24,203
Brittas, will it end up in
eating banana like this?

1607
01:51:24,731 --> 01:51:28,178
Anu - Yeah Karthi decided
to do a small experiment

1608
01:51:28,531 --> 01:51:30,737
Doesn't know whether it
works out but still will give a try

1609
01:51:31,264 --> 01:51:34,473
You should help by sending
some mails -Yeah tell Karthi

1610
01:51:34,597 --> 01:51:35,268
Yeah, will tell

1611
01:52:13,091 --> 01:52:16,072
Karthika Perumal are you fine?

1612
01:52:17,224 --> 01:52:20,466
Greetings sir
Same dressing as expected

1613
01:52:21,357 --> 01:52:23,268
This is the Sakhariya Sir that I told

1614
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:26,560
Sir, this is Anu
I know

1615
01:52:27,055 --> 01:52:28,227
This is the BDO, over here Swetha

1616
01:52:28,722 --> 01:52:32,067
When your mail came,
I was planning for a trip

1617
01:52:32,221 --> 01:52:35,725
To Rajasthan, you might have read
decision of a village chief, there

1618
01:52:36,054 --> 01:52:40,001
When a child is born in the village
a person who told will plant 150 trees

1619
01:52:40,087 --> 01:52:43,330
To meet that person -True on
hearing that I also wanted to meet him

1620
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:32,054
Not seen water and
manure for days, no?

1621
01:53:33,213 --> 01:53:36,352
Should go up to a meter
depth don't you know it?

1622
01:53:37,112 --> 01:53:40,525
Each of half KG
take samples from 20 spots

1623
01:53:42,478 --> 01:53:45,220
Don't hesitate being a dry
land, take from everything

1624
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:51,012
Who are you?

1625
01:53:55,210 --> 01:53:57,314
Who are you?
We are from this place

1626
01:54:04,575 --> 01:54:07,385
Have you seen the
compatriots, if not see it

1627
01:54:09,408 --> 01:54:12,388
Compatriots, fellow those who
love the native is the compatriot

1628
01:54:13,041 --> 01:54:15,021
Now here we are the compatriots

1629
01:54:15,074 --> 01:54:16,348
That is why when he called

1630
01:54:16,507 --> 01:54:18,417
Came from Delhi, Bangalore
and he is from Malaysia

1631
01:54:18,673 --> 01:54:20,016
Came fast to here

1632
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,083
Right now you are all outsiders

1633
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:26,175
Right now this is our soil

1634
01:54:28,172 --> 01:54:32,642
Fellow bring it here, move man or
else will be dirty while chopping

1635
01:54:33,038 --> 01:54:36,542
May get dirty, grow
the beard and smoke

1636
01:54:36,737 --> 01:54:40,513
Com patriots, looks like a hit man

1637
01:54:43,237 --> 01:54:47,685
Kathietta, who are these people?
I'll tell, this is Sakhariya Sir

1638
01:54:48,002 --> 01:54:50,209
One of the senior agricultural
scientist in the country

1639
01:54:50,536 --> 01:54:53,709
Doesn't have the looks they
all are scientists and engineers

1640
01:54:54,201 --> 01:54:57,080
From now on farming and
harvesting is done by our team -

1641
01:54:57,268 --> 01:54:58,542
- at 'Perumal Desham'

1642
01:54:58,701 --> 01:55:01,010
Which means, Karthietta
What will we do?

1643
01:55:01,300 --> 01:55:03,177
Yeah, you people, will tell

1644
01:55:03,734 --> 01:55:07,203
Morning put a pot of
water on fire-heath

1645
01:55:07,366 --> 01:55:10,142
When it boils put a
half kilo slogans to it

1646
01:55:10,332 --> 01:55:13,505
Then stir it well adding
harthal and strikes

1647
01:55:13,698 --> 01:55:16,474
When it is boiled mix it well with
boozing and playing cards

1648
01:55:16,598 --> 01:55:18,509
Serve it and eat it when hot

1649
01:55:19,398 --> 01:55:20,308
Did you understand?

1650
01:55:21,964 --> 01:55:24,376
One who doesn't want
soil, soil also doesn't want him

1651
01:55:25,197 --> 01:55:25,675
Is it not sir?

1652
01:55:30,230 --> 01:55:33,336
They are collecting the
samples of soil and sending it

1653
01:55:33,696 --> 01:55:36,073
From now on machines
are going to work here

1654
01:55:37,029 --> 01:55:40,010
We supervise machines
do the work

1655
01:55:40,295 --> 01:55:41,637
Can trust more than human beings

1656
01:55:41,728 --> 01:55:43,901
On our lands
Shucks, stop it man

1657
01:55:44,061 --> 01:55:45,404
Our land!

1658
01:55:47,027 --> 01:55:50,405
This is his land, does
anyone know who he is?

1659
01:55:50,993 --> 01:55:54,531
On saying yes, ready to give
the salary which he demands

1660
01:55:54,694 --> 01:55:56,468
Not here in foreign universities

1661
01:56:00,226 --> 01:56:05,072
Then he was so patriotic,
should live and die in own country

1662
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:09,296
How can you be such a fool? Do
you know the tem perature this year'?

1663
01:56:09,590 --> 01:56:11,160
42 degree

1664
01:56:11,290 --> 01:56:12,894
And in Gulf its raining

1665
01:56:13,024 --> 01:56:16,005
Over here the forest, hills and rivers
are destroyed using tipper

1666
01:56:16,123 --> 01:56:18,227
Over there in the
desert the plants are grown

1667
01:56:23,056 --> 01:56:26,696
Look Karthi at Kuwait
there is an excellent farm

1668
01:56:27,055 --> 01:56:29,365
Tonnes of Tomato,
Cabbage due to hard work of-

1669
01:56:29,555 --> 01:56:31,329
<i>- one Zainuddin at Mahppuram</i>

1670
01:56:31,387 --> 01:56:33,958
I took his hand and kissed him

1671
01:56:34,187 --> 01:56:35,996
At least that much
we should do, no?

1672
01:56:42,186 --> 01:56:44,462
Sir, pardon us

1673
01:56:44,718 --> 01:56:47,562
No use of catching my hands or
legs he has to take the decision

1674
01:56:47,718 --> 01:56:49,527
Don't you know in
this 'Perumal Desham' -

1675
01:56:49,719 --> 01:56:51,221
- vast extend of land
belongs to them

1676
01:56:51,385 --> 01:56:54,422
By promising crores to start
villa project and IT park

1677
01:56:54,517 --> 01:56:56,053
Real estate people
are on the queue

1678
01:56:56,184 --> 01:56:58,164
By saying bogus expansion
politicians are also there -

1679
01:56:58,351 --> 01:56:59,658
-to reap middle man money

1680
01:56:59,983 --> 01:57:02,463
By disdaining all that
he remains here unmoved -

1681
01:57:02,583 --> 01:57:03,653
- saying this is an agricultural land

1682
01:57:03,950 --> 01:57:05,429
We've come for him

1683
01:57:05,649 --> 01:57:07,993
To start the farming to help him

1684
01:57:12,515 --> 01:57:14,494
Sir, we've made a mistake

1685
01:57:17,514 --> 01:57:21,325
To Karthiettan, we..
Not late even now

1686
01:57:22,014 --> 01:57:25,655
We you are ready to work with him

1687
01:57:27,046 --> 01:57:28,184
Then there is no need of us

1688
01:57:30,179 --> 01:57:32,489
You can make this soil into gold

1689
01:58:18,272 --> 01:58:20,479
This is the story of
'Perumal Desham' so far

1690
01:58:20,972 --> 01:58:23,679
Look its time lets go
Wait, one minute

1691
01:58:24,005 --> 01:58:24,983
Let me ask one more thing

1692
01:58:25,138 --> 01:58:27,516
This Wilson Puthuppali
not going to own native?

1693
01:58:27,671 --> 01:58:30,378
Now this is my native
stopped all the tricks

1694
01:58:30,537 --> 01:58:32,244
Do you know what is the
strength of a movement?

1695
01:58:32,504 --> 01:58:35,314
Agood leader, Karthiettan
is my leader at present

1696
01:58:35,504 --> 01:58:37,449
Will go, come fast if you are bathing

1697
01:58:42,002 --> 01:58:45,972
Winner of this year's 'Padmashree'
is Padmashree Karthi Raj Perumal

1698
01:58:46,335 --> 01:58:48,872
Our dear Karthiettan, will talk to you

1699
01:58:57,899 --> 01:58:59,606
This recognition is not for me

1700
01:58:59,933 --> 01:59:01,537
For agriculture, for hard work

1701
01:59:01,666 --> 01:59:04,272
This Padmashree is a
honour given by nation

1702
01:59:04,500 --> 01:59:08,379
Has heard many saying
farming is not lucrative

1703
01:59:09,032 --> 01:59:11,875
Agriculture is not for income
and profit alone

1704
01:59:12,031 --> 01:59:14,033
While sowing seeds in
our fields and enclosures

1705
01:59:14,497 --> 01:59:16,306
Like wise when it sprouts

1706
01:59:16,964 --> 01:59:20,342
We feel happy and
when the plant grows

1707
01:59:20,530 --> 01:59:23,602
There will be an expectation
in the mind like kids growing up

1708
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:25,966
Sometimes may not get
expected yield

1709
01:59:26,429 --> 01:59:29,342
At that time will feel
desperate but next time

1710
01:59:29,462 --> 01:59:31,100
There will be a vigourto improve

1711
01:59:31,362 --> 01:59:34,205
Like that will make
us happy and sad

1712
01:59:34,361 --> 01:59:36,466
By giving the vigour
and by giving expectation

1713
01:59:36,594 --> 01:59:39,541
Keeps on making a human
being that is the work of soil

1714
01:59:40,694 --> 01:59:45,006
One of the best perfumes in the
world is known to Perumal natives

1715
01:59:45,127 --> 01:59:46,901
That is the smell of the soil

1716
01:59:48,026 --> 01:59:50,302
That smell is not
enjoyed by machines

1717
01:59:51,159 --> 01:59:53,036
We humans should

1718
01:59:58,025 --> 02:00:02,473
To hand over the gift from the
native inviting respected agricultural -

1719
02:00:02,558 --> 02:00:05,266
- department minister Bhaskarji

1720
02:00:20,522 --> 02:00:24,128
I know on all this, the attention
taken by next generation -

1721
02:00:24,254 --> 02:00:25,892
- will be more than what we show

1722
02:00:26,021 --> 02:00:29,399
As to remind that I pass
on this gift to them

1723
02:00:49,018 --> 02:00:52,658
As this function is over native and
men will be back like before

1724
02:00:53,350 --> 02:00:54,158
Me too

1725
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:57,359
Sir, is busy
Sir, is too busy

1726
02:01:04,615 --> 02:01:06,617
Friends two kidneys have failed

1727
02:01:06,949 --> 02:01:12,421
"Beautiful flower come
over the ridges of flower"

1728

"Beloved, forgot to forget you"

1732

1733

"Shall give my soul
which is like mango -"

1734
02:01:42,143 --> 02:01:45,386
"- come as husband and companion"

1735

Saveri in the ears"

"Lotus that bathes in the Brooke"

1740
02:02:44,235 --> 02:02:50,446
"On the smile of your lips
I'll fly like bee"

1741
02:02:50,634 --> 02:02:56,606
"To hear that sound always,
my mind wafts in the breeze"

1742
02:02:56,966 --> 02:03:02,075
"Beloved here I come for a banquet"

1743
02:03:03,265 --> 02:03:09,238

02:03:13,164 --> 02:03:16,873
"- Come as husband and companion"

1746

clouds you vanish"

Jasmine buds which is on your
