1
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,705
Beauty is my forte

2
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,605
Love is my character

3
00:01:21,147 --> 00:01:22,136
Though I am a flame

4
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:25,443
But,outlook is of
fire fly

5
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,563
In front of the bower &
influence of Sultan

6
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,561
No body can utter
a word

7
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:50,897
But

8
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:52,966
But

9
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:57,204
People are whispering in
each others ears

10
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:01,037
What? what are they
talking?

11
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,150
About the relationship of
Razia & Yakoot

12
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:07,712
People who whisper
in ears

13
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:09,954
They are devils

14
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,024
Yakoot is Razias
instructor

15
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,024
Who is giving her,
traning solders

16
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,725
Even there,a slave teaching the
daughter of Sultan

17
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:23,858
Is not proper

18
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:26,370
Shatokaan

19
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,397
Be wary of pride

20
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,203
Punishment for this
serious Crime

21
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,134
Is not slotted for the
resurrection ground

22
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,144
Is given on the
earth itself

23
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:37,513
Don't you know?

24
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,952
That your Sultan was a
slave only

25
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,847
And the precint of this palace
may not have forgotten

26
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,022
That you too,before you become
the keep of Altamash

27
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:49,386
Were a servant

28
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,799
I had forgotten,l am
ashamed

29
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,097
But Razia is a girl

30
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:01,773
Where is the need for her to
learn solder's training

31
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:06,001
This training should have been
given to the sons of Sutlan

32
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,481
Sons! Which sons?

33
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,586
One is a cripple,that
Behram Shah

34
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:20,383
A breathing,living
dead body

35
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:22,561
And the other one

36
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:28,295
Poisonous Snake whom you gave
birth to Ferozsha

37
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,632
Who was pampered and brought up
under your protection

38
00:04:32,171 --> 00:04:33,968
And now he is crawding in
my sleeve

39
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:40,039
How many times I have
warned you Shashokal

40
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:44,516
That don't poke this bleeding
cancer of Altamash

41
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,647
But you won't relent

42
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:54,192
It's evident by the
attitude of Sultan

43
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,997
That he won't appoint his son
Ferozshah as his successor

44
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:06,765
Because your son Ferozshah is
an abhorring character

45
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,400
But when the intelligence of
Balban will support him

46
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,907
He will be
rehabilitated

47
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:20,216
I am confident that an unparralled
politician like Balban

48
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,512
Who is my son-in-law
also

49
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,350
The dreams that l
have nursed

50
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,719
He may be on the Sky

51
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:29,922
For my sake,he will
make them,come true

52
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:38,330
But you will wash the polluted
hands of your son Firozshah

53
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,136
You'll give this promise
to your son-in-law

54
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,809
The hands that snatch the veils of
ladies,and turbans of man

55
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:49,141
And dishonour them

56
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:53,450
And it is hoped

57
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,317
That Balban will
not regret

58
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:01,523
I promise

59
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,576
Greetings Meera Khod

60
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:06,822
May you live long
Mira Khod

61
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:13,196
The type of sward that Mira Khod
had ordered

62
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,332
It has been made

63
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:16,899
Show me

64
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,344
It is exactly according
to your instrutions

65
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,681
Light,flexible

66
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:38,956
More or less straight
and sharp

67
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,190
It's quite dangerous

68
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,975
What's the meaning of
this absence

69
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:45,891
He has insulted me

70
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:50,957
No Razia,he has saved you
from that insult

71
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:53,826
Which was just a
step away

72
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,900
And he has kept such a heavy
stone on his heart

73
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,734
Which will slowly
crush him

74
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:21,652
Razia

75
00:14:26,999 --> 00:14:28,796
The dangerous arrow of
your love

76
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,800
Which was pointing to-wards
him for a long time

77
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:38,971
Has left the bow yesterday
penetrated in his heart

78
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,042
And to-day fearing
that

79
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:48,150
The stain of his hearts blood
should not smear your respect

80
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,151
He has kept away
from you

81
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,193
Slave's job was over
yesterday sir

82
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:02,899
Madam Razia need not take,the
training of a solder any more

83
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:14,543
My friend

84
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,746
Arrange to show
your efforts

85
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:24,388
The dreams that Altamash has been
seeing with closed eyes

86
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:28,454
He wants to see,them
with open eyes

87
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,655
Give your order sir,

88
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:32,754
Go ahead

89
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,864
Yakoot come near

90
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:58,875
Climb the steps

91
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,353
Climb more steps

92
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:09,054
More

93
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:14,890
Life your head

94
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,532
Congratulations

95
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,871
Today Altamash has freed you from
the bondage of slave

96
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:52,297
Mir.Bakshi! My daughter's
slave Yakoot

00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,229
"SULTAN-E-HlND-UL
QUVATTE-UL-MULK

98
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,305
After receiving
this title

99
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,972
He is conferred as'Amir'
and freed!

100
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:03,812
And he has been bestowed with
fort of Akai and surrounding land

101
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:10,279
Sultan's daughter's
slave Yakoot

102
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,323
From SULTANE HlND,by getting
the title of Quwwatul-e-mulk

Has been bestowed with Fort of
Akai and surrounding land

105
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,279
Lord!

106
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,245
Go,and bring her

107
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:13,710
Who?!

108
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,387
That stubborn girl who
was not agreeing

109
00:19:19,758 --> 00:19:20,224
Lord!

110
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,560
This servant has seen
another girl maturing!

111
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:28,661
And has selected her for
Prince's pleasure

112
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:31,732
No bring her only

113
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:34,498
Bring that
proud beauty

114
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:39,335
But Prince,the girl about whom
this servant has said

115
00:19:40,245 --> 00:19:49,415
Is like the bud which is awaiting
tomorrow's sun to blossom!

116
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,857
Wonderful! Excellent!
what a beautiful weather?!

117
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:53,917
Keep quiet!

118
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:57,828
Go!

119
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:04,759
Whatever has been told to you
has already been told

120
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:16,677
Reverend Sultan
Altamash

121
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:23,951
Who is the protector of
the entire Kingdom

122
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,784
After respectful greetings
to him,is informed

123
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,296
Jaanissar Mallick
Jkhtiar Uddin Altunia

124
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:39,299
Who is in charge of
Fort Bhatinda

125
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:42,470
That the chieftan of the army
Burhan-ul-Mulk-

126
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,642
After fighting a great battle
against the rebels

127
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,175
Has become a Martyr in
the battlefield!

128
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:54,317
Now,Multan is on the verge
of imminent danger

129
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:59,315
A prayer,a prayer
a prayer

130
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,827
Remove the
barrier

131
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,230
Come near,Altamash!

132
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:22,739
Sultan,save my daughter!

133
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,843
Your womanizer
son Feroz-

134
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,349
Has kidnapped her through
his wicked henchmen

135
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:31,583
She'll die,Sultan
she'll die

136
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:40,256
You stay here and hold on to
the leg of the Throne

137
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:08,617
Are you crying?!

138
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,322
Goyak!

139
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:53,928
You are becoming a barrier between
my sword and your Criminal son!

140
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:58,606
No,Before that,l have come
to get killed

141
00:22:59,077 --> 00:23:02,535
Then,ls it a condition to kill you
before I kill him!

142
00:23:03,648 --> 00:23:04,342
Yes!

143
00:23:05,684 --> 00:23:11,350
A mother can't see her son
getting killed by his father

144
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,984
But you can see the subjects of
your husband's Kingdom

145
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,425
Being tortured by your
savage son

146
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:22,627
And you can see their honour
& Prestiege being eclipsed

147
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,031
Who are like the daughter
of Altamash

148
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:27,136
Bur remember

149
00:23:27,806 --> 00:23:31,173
Behind you there is a
living danger

150
00:23:32,144 --> 00:23:35,204
Fearing him the time will pray
God to annihilate him!

151
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,808
And you,in the History
of Hindustan

152
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:44,146
Will be eternally remembered
as a dangerous calamity

153
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:48,452
Alas! I can't
kill you

154
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,162
It's hot proper for me
to kill you

155
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:59,332
But with immense hatred for you
in my heart,l am going back

156
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:26,764
Here,by the grace of God
she is safe

157
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:30,158
And the torture that you &
she have gone through

158
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,704
For that forgive your
abashed Sultan

159
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:51,947
Janissar Altonia is waiting for
Royal order every moment

160
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:54,315
That,whether for this
I should

161
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,588
Leave Bhatinda and proceed
towards Multan

162
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:01,862
Or to stop this nuisence
from coming forward

163
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,731
Stay vigilant at his
present position

164
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:05,937
Prime Minister!

165
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,238
It should be known
today itself

166
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,343
Sultan decided to finish this
problem himself

167
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,074
Congratulations!

168
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,742
Defence Minister!
Alakka

169
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,017
Issue a order for
Malik lkhtiar Uddin

170
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,753
That till Altamash
reaches Bhatinda

171
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,019
He should stay in
Bhatinda itself

172
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,589
Commander! Jamaluddin Yakoot

173
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,591
Lord!

174
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:38,369
You assemble the Army

175
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:42,834
And join Altamash in Bhatinda
as soon as possible

176
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:45,434
Lord!

177
00:26:06,665 --> 00:26:07,461
Father Sultan

178
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,128
Dear daughter

179
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:12,761
You are departing for War
tomorrow morning

180
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,433
God willing

181
00:26:15,941 --> 00:26:18,136
Then,this dear daughter will
also go with you

182
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:21,543
And in front of
your eyes

183
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:26,549
With the protection of your
blessing,she will win the War

184
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:28,311
God

185
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:35,856
You are the gift of God
to Altamash

186
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:53,570
Stop

187
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:14,123
Pick her up

188
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,329
God! No one to
listen to me!

189
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:32,109
Leave me! Save me
you wicked,leave me!

190
00:28:32,977 --> 00:28:33,602
Keep quiet

191
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,293
Somebody save me

192
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,263
This message has to be
sent to Sultan

193
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:35,364
As you order

194
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:50,744
Your journey will continue
without stopping anywhere

195
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:40,962
Food,to be served

196
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,621
Along with your wife and mother
share the food with us

197
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:01,853
I am honoured

198
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,611
Silence

199
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,646
Dear daughter
this Amir Althunia

200
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:08,147
From your late mother's side
he is your close relative

201
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:12,662
Althunia,this is a matter of
pride for you

202
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,762
That Sultan is aware of
this relationship

203
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:16,759
Definitely

204
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,160
It is a matter of
great pride

205
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:24,165
That I am entitled to marry the
daughter of Sultan

206
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:27,102
Dear daughter!

207
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:32,113
Amir Althunia is not only
a Governor of the Kingdom

208
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:34,349
He is an excellent Commandor
of the Army also

209
00:32:36,321 --> 00:32:40,690
That's why,the War that
you are going to fight

210
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,421
You can have full confidence
in him

211
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:46,357
Sultan father

212
00:32:47,932 --> 00:32:51,197
When will Amir Yakoot reach here
with the Army?

213
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,697
God willing,by
tomorrow morning

214
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:54,128
Who is this Amir Yakoot?

215
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:58,538
The one who taught the art of
the War fare to daughter Razia!

216
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,386
Feast is over

217
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,709
It was evident by Sultan's
conversation

218
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,948
That Amir Althunia has a
special status

219
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:16,217
And Sultan likes him
a lot

220
00:34:19,657 --> 00:34:21,124
Did you realize anything
from this,Razia?

221
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:22,690
No Kakul!

222
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,456
Razia wasn't present
there

223
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,002
Wonderful

224
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,529
The Army is ready
my Lord!

225
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:46,035
March should begin this evening
itself Amir Althunia

226
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,550
A messenger

227
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,061
A messenger

228
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:25,477
Mallik Mohamand Juradi's
request to the Sultan

229
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:26,850
Respected Sultan

230
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:33,014
The flag of your kindness &
justice is touching the Sky

231
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,618
Under the same flag
your son Feroz Shah

232
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:40,929
By his atrocities and
wicked desoluteness

233
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:43,927
Has tormented your subjects
to such an extent

234
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,601
That people,to save their
prestige & honour

235
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,432
Are running away from their
Homes to the deserts!

236
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,977
And the chief minister doesn't
have the power

237
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,373
To handcuff the person

238
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,045
Who is known as a successer to
your Kingdom,stop it!

239
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,291
Oh! The son of Altamash

240
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:14,790
To your father,you are the
punishment of his sins

241
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:21,134
The sin that Altamash
doesn't remember

242
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:27,675
Father Sultan,stop
the tears!

243
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:32,980
The earth can't bear the
weight of your tears

244
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:41,992
Darling daughter

245
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:44,995
My peace of mind

246
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:48,665
Hold this!

247
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,434
This is the symbol
of the power

248
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:54,167
Return back to Delhi
immediately

249
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:58,341
And take charge of the Kingdom of
Sultan Shamshuddin Altmash

250
00:38:03,214 --> 00:38:03,680
My Lord

251
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,674
You will accompany Razia as
representative of Sultan

252
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:14,047
Altmash is handing over his trust
under your protection

253
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:16,121
God be with you

254
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,359
She is not seen
anywhere

255
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:35,322
God save her!

256
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:25,509
To everybody,this is the
announcement

257
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:34,018
By the order of Fakurusalateen
Sultan Shamshuddin Altmash

258
00:51:35,358 --> 00:51:38,327
Daughter of Sultan,Madam
Razia Khatoon

259
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:44,656
As incharge of the Kingdom
and holding full authority

260
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:49,795
To rule over Hindustan
from today

261
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,401
Is entering the Court

262
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:03,546
It is the duty of the
heirs to the kingdom

263
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:08,118
The sword of Sultan which is the
symbol of the power

264
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:09,457
By putting the
hand on it

265
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:13,687
Accept the order &
be loyal to it

266
00:52:18,568 --> 00:52:21,230
Kuwaat-Ul-Mulk Yakoot

267
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,409
You know it that he
is a cripple

268
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:29,703
He can't lift his hand
by himself

269
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:44,057
Let this proclaimation be made in
markets,neighbourhood & lanes

270
00:52:44,427 --> 00:52:53,233
That from today,to protect
the helpless and the poor

271
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:57,403
Law enforcerers will patrol
the towns

272
00:52:58,441 --> 00:53:01,239
Every morning Razia
herself

273
00:53:01,778 --> 00:53:04,576
Will come out of the fort
and move on the roads

274
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:10,242
And every citizen will
have the right -

275
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:15,251
Narrate their woes
without any fear

276
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,934
Princess help us

277
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,264
What's the matter?

278
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:34,937
Your brother Ferozshah has
ordered my innocent daughter -

279
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,443
To come to his unholy
chambers -

280
00:53:37,647 --> 00:53:41,276
Tonight his goons will
kidnap her -

281
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,449
And our prestige
will go to dust

282
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:48,624
Where do you stay?

283
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:50,459
In that house

284
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,461
Be assured,it will
not happen

285
00:54:23,526 --> 00:54:23,821
Come

286
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,001
Come on the bed

287
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:56,188
Devil

288
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:08,534
Mother,Mother,Mother

289
00:55:08,905 --> 00:55:09,701
What's it?

290
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,371
Razia beat me!

291
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:15,544
And you took her
beating

292
00:55:16,413 --> 00:55:17,209
Why?

293
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:20,045
I am afraid of her

294
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,382
But I hate her

295
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:32,892
I hate her

296
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:40,725
Till now 400 families have been
rehabilitated in their homes

297
00:55:48,778 --> 00:55:51,246
Northern Mehroli which was
almost devastated

298
00:55:51,781 --> 00:55:52,577
Has been
rehabilitated

299
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:03,248
Seven Police stations at different
places have been created

300
00:56:13,303 --> 00:56:17,262
2000 guards are patrolling the
colonies,round the clock

301
00:56:20,477 --> 00:56:20,943
Very good

302
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,773
Free fodder will be distributed
for another month

303
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,956
Along with the order of
managing the Kingdom

304
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:47,129
You,have brought the right to
slap your elder brother

305
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:52,305
Don't you know the one whom you
have misbehaved with

306
00:56:53,343 --> 00:56:54,810
Is the heir to the
Kingdom

307
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,305
Commandor

308
00:56:59,182 --> 00:57:01,150
Go & immediately arrest
Feroz shah

309
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:04,153
Who is not yet the heir
to Kingdom

310
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:08,487
By the order of Razia,
manager of the Kingdom

311
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:11,160
And throw him in
the dungeon

312
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:13,919
Remember

313
00:57:14,898 --> 00:57:18,664
A day will come,when
for your misbehaviour

314
00:57:19,335 --> 00:57:21,326
He will take severe
revenge

315
00:57:38,555 --> 00:57:39,021
Who is there?

316
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:43,525
Why have you come
here?

317
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:48,694
To arrest the son of Sultan
for a serious crime

318
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,693
Crime? What crime?

319
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:56,695
To help escape a criminal from
custody is a serious crime

320
00:57:57,740 --> 00:57:58,866
Impertinent Negro!

321
00:57:59,742 --> 00:58:02,040
Are you not aware to whom
you are talking to?

322
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:06,041
If you can't see
then listen

323
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:08,714
I am the wife
of Sultan

324
00:58:09,252 --> 00:58:09,718
No

325
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:14,712
Here infront of Yakoot
you are a culprit of law

326
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:17,719
Which has no name
at the moment

327
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:19,220
Silence

328
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:22,064
I have a dagger
in my hand

329
00:58:22,932 --> 00:58:23,899
Move away

330
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,235
Otherwise your head will
be in my toes

331
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:57,926
By the threats of a slave you
left the hand of your son

332
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:03,268
Now this abominable Palace
will not remain

333
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:06,267
It's walls will crumble
by my retaliation

334
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:14,783
Take your dagger

335
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:17,786
It'll be useful to
you again

336
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:21,123
But not on the chest
of Yakoot

337
00:59:22,325 --> 00:59:23,121
But on his back

338
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,790
Yes,my most strong attack will
be on your back only

339
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:32,301
I am your death
wait for me

340
00:59:38,841 --> 00:59:41,469
You have understood very well
isn't it?

341
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:47,641
Very well

342
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,646
And also that if the
secret is let out

343
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,987
Or you are not able
to do your duty

344
00:59:56,192 --> 00:59:57,318
Then you will be
wiped out

345
00:59:58,861 --> 01:00:02,160
Certainly,l will be
wiped out

346
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:03,999
Go

347
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:39,862
A prayer,a prayer
a prayer

348
01:00:40,403 --> 01:00:43,702
I am ruined,l am
finished

349
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:46,875
What happened?
Tell me?

350
01:00:47,744 --> 01:00:50,713
I can't show my face
to the World

351
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:55,213
The honour of my innocent
daughter -

352
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,220
Has been tarnished
by a cruel man

353
01:01:00,256 --> 01:01:00,881
Who is it?

354
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:05,227
Tell me?

355
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,397
Tell me,who is that
cruel man?

356
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:14,061
It's him

357
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:20,075
Who?

358
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,737
This cruel Yakoot!

359
01:01:32,288 --> 01:01:34,756
Quwaat-Ul-Mulk,What
is she saying?

360
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:39,917
This blame is a conspiracy
to kill me!

361
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:45,423
Woman,do you know whom
have you accused?

362
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:50,428
Yes I know you have
heard my petition

363
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:55,106
Now it is your duty that you
close your eyes

364
01:01:55,978 --> 01:01:56,945
And do justice

365
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:01,446
Put Quwaat-Ul-Mulk down
from the horse

366
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:03,114
And arrest him

367
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:11,623
Yes its him

368
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,795
He dishonoured my
daughter

369
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,089
Accused Jamaluddin
Yakoot

370
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,692
The accusation that has
been put on you

371
01:02:20,770 --> 01:02:22,795
About that,what is
your answer?

372
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:28,810
God is witness,l don't
know this woman

373
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:33,107
Yes,you don't
know me

374
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:39,612
You have not spoiled me but you
have dishonoured my daughter

375
01:02:40,123 --> 01:02:45,186
Oh you wicked woman who are
you? Who are you?

376
01:02:48,731 --> 01:02:53,100
Accused,don't terrorize
the petioner,put your defence

377
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:04,108
This is a conspiracy
it is a lie

378
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:06,613
Only words are
not enough

379
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,317
Wicked girl,Why have
you become my enemy?

380
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:18,686
Won't you speak the
truth till my death?

381
01:03:49,625 --> 01:03:52,822
Accused,your silence will
cost you your life

382
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:56,827
Listen,if you are not
absolved of this crime

383
01:03:57,433 --> 01:04:00,095
The consequence will be
examplory

384
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:01,932
In the market
place you

385
01:04:02,905 --> 01:04:04,873
Will be half buried
in the ground

386
01:04:05,975 --> 01:04:10,810
People will stone you so that
you will definitely die

387
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,839
Bano don't
hail me

388
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:16,073
Don't call me
towards you

389
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,012
After seeing you

390
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:24,846
This night will drink the
entire blood of my body

391
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:26,688
And tomorrow

392
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:30,686
The wounds inflicted on
me by stone hitting

393
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,085
Won't be able ooze
out my blood

394
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:35,921
And people will think

395
01:05:37,133 --> 01:05:38,157
That before death
itself

396
01:05:39,402 --> 01:05:40,426
The fear of death

397
01:05:41,470 --> 01:05:43,597
Has sucked the
blood of Yakoot!

398
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:50,676
Go far,Go far away
from me

399
01:05:51,747 --> 01:05:53,408
And hide somewhere

400
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:58,720
If I see you
before dying

401
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:04,358
Even after my death my
eyes will remain alive

402
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:14,919
Let people pick up stones
to hit the criminal

403
01:07:45,995 --> 01:07:50,989
All your creations
have to die

404
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:56,532
But on the false &
shameful accusations

405
01:07:57,773 --> 01:08:00,742
I am condemned to die the shameful
& humiliating death

406
01:08:02,445 --> 01:08:04,504
Why is your justice
not included in it?

407
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:08,981
Why didn't you give your
testimony of my innocence?

408
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:14,352
I am coming to your court
with this complaint

409
01:09:04,740 --> 01:09:07,675
Who is that,who has prefered
the accusation

410
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:14,045
Sultan innocent,Look
at your daughter

411
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:16,516
I,the helpless
mother

412
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,146
You have,not your daughter
why not?

413
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:23,949
Because of the
fear of disgrace

414
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,129
But you have already
disgraced her

415
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:30,988
Girl come here

416
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:38,536
Come here

417
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,144
Come near

418
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:59,924
Raise your eyes,look into
the eyes of Sultan

419
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:04,394
Sultan

420
01:10:05,668 --> 01:10:07,898
Yes tell me what's
the truth?

421
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:10,835
I am a liar

422
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:16,544
On the point of dagger I was
forced to tell the lie

423
01:10:20,115 --> 01:10:23,482
It is proclaimed that those
helpless people

424
01:10:24,153 --> 01:10:27,054
Who have been the victims of
soshaya's Atrocities

425
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:30,217
They present themselves
in the Court

426
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,286
And put forward their
prayers

427
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:38,022
Accused Feroz Shah,l have heard
complaints against you

428
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,825
The accusations that have
been levelled against you

429
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:43,471
Do you have to say anything
in your defense

430
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:55,250
In the face of numerous
testimonies

431
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:58,719
Your silence means,acceptance
of your guilt

432
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:03,450
It means without any doubt,you
have been proved guilty

433
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:07,093
Respected clergyman!

434
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:10,894
The Atrocities committed by
the accused on them

435
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,361
The affected victims have
given their statements

436
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,231
The Crime of murder
is not proved

437
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:22,338
But the serious Crimes
that he has committed

438
01:11:23,979 --> 01:11:26,174
Severe punishment should
be awarded

439
01:11:28,817 --> 01:11:32,309
He should be tied to the pole
given 70 lashes

440
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:49,062
Sultan have pity,
he is your son

441
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:00,205
No,No

442
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:10,055
I can't see this,take
me away from here

443
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:29,803
Respected Qazi,what
is the order now?

444
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:33,379
One more lash will
cause his death

445
01:12:34,717 --> 01:12:35,479
Respected clergyman

446
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:44,258
The balance punishment should be borne
by the next king of the accused!

447
01:13:31,874 --> 01:13:32,898
Do your duty

448
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:03,961
Prayer

449
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:51,612
Oh Lord!

450
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:58,951
Burn it

451
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:05,857
My lord

452
01:15:09,972 --> 01:15:14,136
Father Sultan,
Father Sultan

453
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:52,579
Why is everyone
quiet?

454
01:15:54,583 --> 01:15:57,609
Sultan with your
permission

455
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:00,515
These faithfuls of the Kingdom
for some moments

456
01:16:01,823 --> 01:16:04,257
May move away from the
presence of Sultan

457
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:07,586
And after the discussion on
this important question-

458
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:09,491
The may come back
amongst ourselves

459
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,095
Permission granted

460
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:35,122
Sultan

461
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:37,992
No doubt all your
faithfuls

462
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:44,598
On one signal from your
daughter Lady Razia

463
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,201
They'll sacrifice
their lives

464
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:51,398
But

465
01:16:54,209 --> 01:16:59,078
But officers won't
accept her

466
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:03,282
Because,for Sultan's
ministers,Amir's

467
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:09,148
And commanders,it is against
their manly vanity

468
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:12,088
Because she is a
woman,-keep quiet

469
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:16,531
Ala Khaff keep quiet
keep quiet

470
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:28,542
My Lord!

471
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,379
Sultan has called

472
01:17:44,426 --> 01:17:44,790
My Lord!

473
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:48,662
Laila

474
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:52,324
Sultan has called
my Lord

475
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:56,069
Sultan,at this time

476
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:57,167
Just now

477
01:18:20,896 --> 01:18:25,230
Come,Altamash has
called you

478
01:18:47,355 --> 01:18:48,117
Put the seal on this

479
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:09,806
Only you are
that person

480
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:18,844
On whose naked dagger,if
Altamash will put his neck

481
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:27,320
It's edge will become soft like
the feather of an angel

482
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:40,799
You saw,you heard

483
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:46,141
That How the honest advise
of your Sultan

484
01:19:47,716 --> 01:19:48,705
The narrow minded
Amirs

485
01:19:49,885 --> 01:19:51,682
Have rejected
dishonestly

486
01:19:55,423 --> 01:19:56,685
This is the will of
Altamash

487
01:19:58,927 --> 01:20:02,363
To reach it to the people
is your duty

488
01:20:04,366 --> 01:20:07,164
They'll definitely accept the
will of their Sultan

489
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:08,864
And

490
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:12,738
And will stand
by you

491
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:21,678
Come here

492
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,616
The fact is

493
01:20:31,827 --> 01:20:34,125
That the time to show
your loyalty

494
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,792
Didn't come before this
and today

495
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:41,092
You are the caretaker of the
happiness of Altamash

496
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:47,832
But the time to show your
loyalty has come now

497
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:52,880
Thank God

498
01:20:54,816 --> 01:20:58,616
That ultimately,that time
has come now

499
01:21:00,255 --> 01:21:02,246
When the interpretation of the
dreams of my Lord

500
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,387
Will be written by the
blood of his slave

501
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:07,893
This is the will of...

502
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:13,424
Sultan Shamshuddin Altamash

503
01:21:16,471 --> 01:21:17,836
People of Hindustan

504
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:43,364
Write!

505
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:49,861
If you have belief in
Sultan Altamash!

506
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:54,040
...After his death...

507
01:22:00,649 --> 01:22:02,640
...As paying your tributes!

508
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,077
Instal Razia Sultan
as your Queen!

509
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:21,100
Laila! I warn you not to shed
tears and show your weakness!

510
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,368
My Lord,my heart is
shivering with fear!

511
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:29,540
I can't write any more!

512
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:32,513
Stop it! And write!

513
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:42,348
Instal Razia as
your Queen!

514
01:23:12,954 --> 01:23:15,422
Laila! Are you crying?

515
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:19,057
And,your tears have
given me ample hints

516
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:25,760
That your weak heart may not be able
to withstand this secret!

517
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:30,563
That's why,killing you
has become very important!

518
01:23:32,607 --> 01:23:33,437
Get yourself killed!

519
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,113
And you get yourself
killed!

520
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:47,588
Yes,My Lord!

521
01:23:49,758 --> 01:23:51,749
Your thought is right!

522
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:56,788
I am weak and
also a woman

523
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:04,170
Without any doubt you can kill me
and get your doubts cleared!

524
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:12,205
My Lord! I forgive you
for my killing!

525
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:22,289
Now,definitely you'll
remain silent!

526
01:24:24,092 --> 01:24:27,220
Think that,l have already
killed you!

527
01:25:02,831 --> 01:25:07,859
Sultan! Why are you staring at me
like this,to-day?

528
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:13,738
Because,this Sultan,your
father perhaps...

529
01:25:16,411 --> 01:25:17,969
May not be able to see you
like this again!

530
01:25:19,247 --> 01:25:19,975
Don't say like that!

531
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:24,409
May God bless you with my
remaining life also!

532
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:25,586
May the God doesn't bless
me like that!...

533
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:28,947
My lovely child,you have a
long life to live

534
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:31,921
After Altamash!....

535
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,255
To keep this Mascot
of power

536
01:25:35,230 --> 01:25:37,562
And keep it Holy from dirtying
with innocents blood!

537
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,768
And to save this Crown from
the blows of Criminals!

538
01:25:43,671 --> 01:25:45,832
You must be alive
Razia Sultan!

539
01:25:53,348 --> 01:25:56,875
No...Father..
no...Not now!

540
01:25:59,354 --> 01:26:00,878
This sun will
not set now!

541
01:26:02,924 --> 01:26:04,391
And it will not
dark now!

542
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:10,896
My child,allow me to say
what I wish to say!

543
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,401
At this moment,every moment
is precious!

544
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:18,899
Stop these tears!

545
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:24,075
Your eyes are not for
shedding tears!

546
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,575
And listen to this
Father's advice!

547
01:26:30,351 --> 01:26:41,194
This Altamash has been dreaming
of seeing the Crown on your head!

548
01:26:42,530 --> 01:26:44,930
That dream will definitely
come true!

549
01:26:47,335 --> 01:26:49,929
And when those dreams
come true...

550
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:51,599
...Then remember...

551
01:26:52,807 --> 01:27:00,043
That,you are not,God's children
Ruler....but,be their...protector!

552
01:27:06,988 --> 01:27:11,118
Quwwat-ul-mulk!! Amir
Jamaluddeen Yakoot lsherel

553
01:27:29,277 --> 01:27:30,107
Let him in!

554
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:31,872
Why did you do
like this?

555
01:28:33,174 --> 01:28:35,870
So that,My Lord's revered
word's....

556
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:40,142
...Will become the heart and beat with
every breath of this slave!

557
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:12,241
Stamp this official seal,with your hands
on the chest of this slave!

558
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,784
Stamp the seal,
my Lord!

559
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,987
Don't delay in fulfilling the
wish of this slave!

560
01:30:08,136 --> 01:30:08,795
What's the matter?

561
01:30:09,537 --> 01:30:10,231
Come on tell!

562
01:30:11,472 --> 01:30:13,963
The Princess has called daughter
of the Minister!

563
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:17,911
Food!

564
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:22,782
Kakul! All the ways of Father's
chambers are closed!

565
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:25,818
And It's fearsome silence that
is pervading outside!

566
01:30:26,387 --> 01:30:29,049
I don't know,what's happening
inside those Cruel walls?

567
01:30:29,557 --> 01:30:30,182
Father is....

568
01:30:32,693 --> 01:30:38,495
Sultan is dead! And Firoz Shah has
been declared as next Sultan!

569
01:30:38,699 --> 01:30:38,994
Father!!!

570
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:40,167
No...Razia...No!

571
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:42,335
For God's sake,bear this
shock of Grief!

572
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:43,831
This is not the time to
dilly dallying!

573
01:30:44,138 --> 01:30:45,105
This is the time to save
ourselves and escape!

574
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:48,172
Your life is in danger!
Get away from this danger!

575
01:30:48,676 --> 01:30:51,236
I am standing between your life
and your enemies!

576
01:30:51,479 --> 01:30:54,277
Go! God save you!!

577
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:13,757
Open the Door!!!

578
01:33:30,905 --> 01:33:31,496
Who's that?!

579
01:33:32,039 --> 01:33:34,098
Get back!...get back!!

580
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:53,919
Oh! God! What's this?

581
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:58,592
Oh! August Assembly!!
what's this disaster?

582
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:05,300
A drunkard with tambling feet is
descreting this Holy Throne!

583
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:09,975
Hey! You old man! What's this
you are blabbering?

584
01:34:10,544 --> 01:34:15,208
I told,what the clergyman of the
Court has the right to say!

585
01:34:18,786 --> 01:34:21,812
Ruknuddeen! Beware!
what Crime are you doing?

586
01:34:22,189 --> 01:34:24,987
Sultan,he is the clergyman
of this Court!

587
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:26,682
Don't disgrace him!

588
01:34:56,557 --> 01:34:58,081
Why did you come here
without permission?

589
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:04,589
To inform you about how we all made
possible your impossible desire

590
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:08,767
Of making Ruknuddeen as
Sultan and prescuted you!

591
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,197
They have all become
disillusined with you!

592
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:13,097
You are left alone!

593
01:35:13,941 --> 01:35:18,901
And your favourite son's head has
become heavy for his shoulders!

594
01:38:51,158 --> 01:38:52,216
Stop it...Stop it...

01:38:52,826 --> 01:38:54,225

Throw these tracherous
liquours!

They have poison in it!

606
01:40:11,338 --> 01:40:12,566
It's God's grace!

607
01:40:13,507 --> 01:40:15,099
For the sake of Rights

01:40:56,817 --> 01:40:57,784
What's all this
noise?

616
01:40:58,185 --> 01:40:59,345
This is the

In your pavilion,my petition!

01:45:28,722 --> 01:45:29,780
If it is granted!

641
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:36,358
And if you accept
my proposal!

642
01:45:38,465 --> 01:45:41,298

644
01:45:54,481 --> 01:46:01,717
Oh! Great Queen Razia Sultan!
Greetings!

645
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:05,423
Don't get worried about the
fact that!

646
01:46:06,293 --> 01:46:08,261
At such a tender young age

647
01:46:08,962 --> 01:46:15,197
You look like a tender
frail girl on that stern throne -

648
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:19,100
And you'll not be able to establish
your power in the court!

649
01:46:21,308 --> 01:46:27,713
This your humble man has 57 years
of experience in ruling a State

650
01:46:28,215 --> 01:46:30,945
And has the support and Strength of
32 thousand Swords man!

651
01:46:38,125 --> 01:46:40,116

652
01:46:42,496 --> 01:46:42,928
Greetings!

653
01:46:44,731 --> 01:46:51,364
I feel that the beautiful Milkyway
has descended on the earth in your form

654
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:55,735
To achieve that,all these paper
desire of the Eminent people

655
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:01,304
Have been torn into pieces
and are floating in the water!

656
01:47:05,852 --> 01:47:09,982
Because,the lucky Amir of Altunia's
petition is not in them!

657
01:47:13,326 --> 01:47:15,260
Altunia's petition is through
words of mouth!

658
01:47:16,196 --> 01:47:17,663
Which are being told
in your presence!

659
01:47:32,512 --> 01:47:37,506
How great it would be,if the
petition of Altunia is accepted!

660
01:47:38,185 --> 01:47:39,379
If it is accepted in
my presence itself!

661
01:47:46,893 --> 01:47:49,020
May be it is not
necessary to tell!

662
01:47:50,197 --> 01:47:54,293
It is only the Altunia's
Loyal blood!!

663
01:47:55,302 --> 01:47:58,032
That has spilled more on
the Land of Sultanate!

664
01:48:00,941 --> 01:48:06,573
And you'll find in plenty,Body's with
innumerable marks of Supreme sacrifices!

665
01:48:36,109 --> 01:48:37,576
How impatient l
am also?

666
01:48:38,678 --> 01:48:44,310
To hear the happy news of acceptance
of my petition immediately

667
01:48:47,787 --> 01:48:52,087
Without any doubt,l have
to patiently wait!

668
01:48:53,627 --> 01:48:54,594
Till tomorrow!!

669
01:48:56,463 --> 01:49:00,263
Tomorrow which will take eons to
become tomorrow from today!

670
01:49:45,845 --> 01:49:52,148
Queen of Grace! Queen of Beauty
Empress of lndia

671
01:49:53,019 --> 01:49:55,317
Razia Sultan's
Royal Edict!

672
01:49:58,525 --> 01:50:01,653
Oh! August Assembly
of Court!

673
01:50:02,529 --> 01:50:04,156
This is a Happy
occassion!

674
01:50:05,031 --> 01:50:09,331
Almost every Amir has with utmost
conviction considered that!

675
01:50:09,869 --> 01:50:12,497
Sultanate is
the ultimate!

676
01:50:13,206 --> 01:50:18,166
That special Sultan in which without
taking help from any man!

677
01:50:18,545 --> 01:50:19,842
She'll not be
able to manage!

678
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:25,340
You have helped her in
managing in your own way!

679
01:50:34,561 --> 01:50:38,361
It is obvious that,every Amir
is very dear to Sultan!

680
01:50:39,733 --> 01:50:58,745
So,it is proclaimed that they fight
each other to gain the right of honour!

681
01:51:00,086 --> 01:51:04,546
I believe that for this special
occassion this method!

682
01:51:05,091 --> 01:51:08,549
Will be a honour to the
Amirs present here!

683
01:51:26,279 --> 01:51:29,737
This royal edict is an open
gesture of Victory to you!

684
01:51:30,617 --> 01:51:31,083
How?

685
01:51:31,618 --> 01:51:35,418
Who can wage and win against
the Amir of Altunia?

686
01:51:36,956 --> 01:51:40,084
Please accept congratulations from
your humble slave!

687
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,117
You were not present in
the royal court!

688
01:52:10,824 --> 01:52:14,123
But,you must have heard about
Razia Sultan's proclaimation?

689
01:52:14,994 --> 01:52:15,619
Yes,l did

690
01:52:17,497 --> 01:52:19,624
And you also must have understood
the meaning of it!

691
01:52:24,671 --> 01:52:27,640
The competition which will take place
to achieve Razia Sultan!

692
01:52:29,008 --> 01:52:34,969
In that Commandor Yakoot must
test his valour and his fate!

693
01:52:39,519 --> 01:52:39,985
No!

694
01:52:41,187 --> 01:52:41,653
No?!

695
01:52:44,023 --> 01:52:44,318
No!

696
01:52:45,191 --> 01:52:45,816
Why not?!

697
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:53,321
What'll happen if this Atlamash's
slave wins the competition?

698
01:52:54,367 --> 01:52:57,996
Funeral of Razia's
good reputation!

699
01:52:59,205 --> 01:53:01,173
Covered with disgrace

700
01:53:02,041 --> 01:53:04,339
Will be circled till the
end of the World!

701
01:53:05,712 --> 01:53:08,840
And if this Commandor of the
Army of the Sultanate!

702
01:53:09,716 --> 01:53:11,183
Loses intentionally!

703
01:53:12,218 --> 01:53:14,516
Then,the Army will be fretful
and become rebels

704
01:53:15,555 --> 01:53:17,682
Sultanates power on the
State will wither!

705
01:53:18,892 --> 01:53:29,200
And blood will ooze from the Altamash's
will on this slaves chart

706
01:54:26,292 --> 01:54:29,921
I regret! Our plan
has failed!

707
01:54:30,797 --> 01:54:33,265
He is not ready to participate
in the competition

708
01:54:35,635 --> 01:54:38,604
No Kakal!
He'll come!

709
01:56:02,555 --> 01:56:05,683
So,who's my competitor?

710
01:56:09,228 --> 01:56:10,195
Who's it?

711
01:56:11,064 --> 01:56:15,364
Who's willing that the sword of
Altamash taste his blood?

712
01:56:24,077 --> 01:56:24,873
Is there anyone?

713
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,545
Is there anyone?

714
01:56:40,927 --> 01:56:41,393
No one!

715
01:57:07,787 --> 01:57:08,913
Khalil of Altunia!

716
01:57:09,455 --> 01:57:13,755
No! How can a Turk fight
against a Negro!

717
01:57:17,797 --> 01:57:18,593
It's cruel!

718
01:57:19,966 --> 01:57:23,595
A fight between a proud Turk and
a Negro couldn't take place!

719
01:57:45,825 --> 01:57:48,623
This time Sultan had behaved
very rigidly!

720
01:57:49,829 --> 01:57:52,627
But the next time when
we meet at a place!

721
01:57:53,332 --> 01:57:56,460
There,Sultan will regret for
today's rigidity!

722
01:58:13,352 --> 01:58:15,479
Greetings to the
Prime Minister!

723
01:58:22,028 --> 01:58:23,495
Greetings to
Amir Balban!

724
01:58:30,036 --> 01:58:32,004
Balban,is it an
important matter?

725
01:58:32,705 --> 01:58:36,334
Very important and
disgusting

726
01:58:45,384 --> 01:58:48,353
They are deaf! They
can't hear!

727
01:58:49,889 --> 01:58:54,849
This intelligent daughter,anything
which she hears never repeats it!

728
01:58:57,730 --> 01:59:01,359
Anyway! Balban has come
here to tell you

729
01:59:02,568 --> 01:59:10,373
That our Sultan's ever increasing
unreasonable favours on a Negro!

730
01:59:10,576 --> 01:59:13,545
Are spreading various kinds
of false suspicions!

731
01:59:14,080 --> 01:59:20,383
Because of these false suspicions the
Turk Amirs hot blood is hotting up!

732
01:59:22,588 --> 01:59:31,053
Like there is an Earth quake at
the base before the Earth ruptures!

733
01:59:32,431 --> 01:59:35,229
The same power of strength
this news of Sultanate has!

734
01:59:37,103 --> 01:59:42,735
And now,It's the authority of the
Prime Minister the oldest and wisest about!

735
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:49,571
To explain and make the Altamash's
daughter Razia understand it!

736
01:59:51,617 --> 01:59:54,085
That,the honourable turks
will get enraged!

737
01:59:55,121 --> 02:00:01,424
If the Moon of their chastity is
blackened by the Negro!

738
02:00:03,296 --> 02:00:04,422
But,Amir Balban!

739
02:00:06,299 --> 02:00:21,112
Calling the commandor Yakoot without
his titles is an open defiance!

740
02:00:43,336 --> 02:00:48,296
The weather isn't good now-a-days
It's very hot!

741
02:00:49,008 --> 02:00:49,633
May be!

742
02:00:54,180 --> 02:00:59,140
Excellent! What a great shot that was
from her excellency Razia Sultan?

743
02:01:01,687 --> 02:01:02,654
Prime Minister!

744
02:01:03,689 --> 02:01:12,324
You are here to talk about something
else other than weather or Archery!

745
02:01:17,036 --> 02:01:18,003
Without any doubt!
without any doubt!

746
02:01:29,215 --> 02:01:34,676
But has come as a father of a
daughter to advice her!

747
02:01:52,405 --> 02:01:54,202
Actually it is
absolutely wrong!

748
02:01:55,241 --> 02:01:59,200
But,Without any reason everyone is getting
restless with false suspicion!

749
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:01,706
That by your tilting
towards one side

750
02:02:02,581 --> 02:02:06,381
The world's most powerful
Sultanate's thrown is shaking!

751
02:02:08,421 --> 02:02:12,050
Every one has fallen to this
vicious false propaganda

752
02:02:12,591 --> 02:02:14,559
But,l don't have even the
smallest doubt in it!

753
02:02:15,094 --> 02:02:21,897
That in the way to Queen,Razia's heart
only one man's foot steps are heard!

754
02:02:24,103 --> 02:02:24,569
That's it

755
02:02:26,272 --> 02:02:29,241
I shouldn't talk more openly
about this matter!

756
02:02:30,443 --> 02:02:31,569
That'll be better!

757
02:02:32,945 --> 02:02:38,406
Razia Sultan has understood the
meaning of that Harsh language!

758
02:02:39,952 --> 02:02:43,581
I didn't know that the Robes of
Sultan would cause my death!

759
02:02:44,957 --> 02:02:49,417
But Razia is alive! She'll
overcome this death!

760
02:03:15,988 --> 02:03:20,618
The dust of rumours that are being
raised are the works of Devils!

761
02:03:21,994 --> 02:03:28,797
And in these dusty storms the prestige
and honour of Razia Sultan is getting blind

762
02:03:36,342 --> 02:03:41,644
For this old veteran,you are
dear to me like a son!

763
02:03:45,184 --> 02:03:45,650
But...

764
02:03:47,019 --> 02:03:49,487
The one who is more dearer
to me,than my daughter!

765
02:03:51,023 --> 02:03:54,982
To save her honour and for to
safeguard the Sultanate!

766
02:03:56,362 --> 02:03:59,661
I want to sacrifice even my most
duty conscious son

767
02:04:01,367 --> 02:04:04,495
I want to
sacrifice you!

768
02:04:06,205 --> 02:04:07,502
Sacrifice me!

769
02:04:19,218 --> 02:04:21,345
This head was there
only to be cut!

770
02:04:35,067 --> 02:04:39,697
No,l want to torture you
more than this!

771
02:04:40,906 --> 02:04:45,206
I wish,that you leave this
Sultanate and go away!

772
02:10:18,577 --> 02:10:20,044
My dear beloved!

773
02:10:21,246 --> 02:10:30,211
Your lover is carrying the sacrificed
corpse of his bury somewhere else!

774
02:10:32,090 --> 02:10:34,888
So that even my grave's
inauspicious mark-

775
02:10:36,094 --> 02:10:41,896
Does not become a black mark
on you Sultanate!

776
02:10:43,435 --> 02:10:45,903
No,this will
never happen!

777
02:12:32,210 --> 02:12:36,510
You got it wrong,that Razia
will allow you to get lost!

778
02:12:37,883 --> 02:12:41,011
Even if you had run away beyound
the boundries of land and life!

779
02:12:41,720 --> 02:12:43,847
Razia would have searched
and found you out!

780
02:12:44,723 --> 02:12:49,183
For God sake,don't be obstinate
in changing my destiny

781
02:12:50,562 --> 02:12:51,859
Let me go away!

782
02:12:52,397 --> 02:12:53,022
No!

783
02:12:54,066 --> 02:12:59,026
Everyone is talking about the
affair between you and me!

784
02:12:59,738 --> 02:13:05,040
And now time will never be able
to wipe out your name with mine!

785
02:13:06,912 --> 02:13:12,373
Listen,l am an accusation
on your life!

786
02:13:14,753 --> 02:13:17,551
Let me die! allow me
to go away!

787
02:13:19,091 --> 02:13:20,217
Don't move!

788
02:13:21,093 --> 02:13:24,722
Or else my sword will not allow you
to take another step forward!

789
02:13:27,265 --> 02:13:29,893
My killing...
by your hands...

790
02:13:31,269 --> 02:13:37,902
Oh! God,this mercy on me will
also be proved as God's mercy!

791
02:13:57,796 --> 02:13:59,764
Get away!...Get away!!

792
02:14:00,966 --> 02:14:05,767
Don't ever turn back and see
what has be fallen on Razia?

793
02:15:23,715 --> 02:15:30,518
God's country! Proclamation of
the Sultan!

794
02:15:31,223 --> 02:15:40,689
Queen of Beauty! Queen of the Sultanate
Razia Sultan!

795
02:15:41,733 --> 02:15:46,864
Tommorow morning will appear
in the Dewan-e-aam!

796
02:15:56,248 --> 02:15:59,547
Razia,from the ramparts
of the Fort!

797
02:16:00,919 --> 02:16:05,379
Is speaking to you as a Sultan
for the last time!

798
02:16:07,259 --> 02:16:11,559
You may remember that 3 years
and 8 months back...

799
02:16:12,764 --> 02:16:17,724
How your hearts were pierced
with daggers of cruelty!

800
02:16:19,104 --> 02:16:23,564
And how your lives were meanful
under the heap of sorrows

801
02:16:24,943 --> 02:16:30,245
Razia,came as your Queen,took
the weight of the Crown on her!

802
02:16:31,283 --> 02:16:34,081
And had promised
your safety

803
02:16:35,287 --> 02:16:44,923
And has vowed that she'll bring back
smiles on the lips shivering from fear!

804
02:16:46,131 --> 02:16:52,434
Didn't she fulfil
that vow?!

805
02:16:52,637 --> 02:16:54,434
Yes,she had
fulfiled!

806
02:16:55,307 --> 02:16:58,936
I thank God! that the
necessity of Razia is over!

807
02:17:00,478 --> 02:17:04,608
So,l Razia will
relinguish the Crown

808
02:17:05,483 --> 02:17:10,614
And hands over it you,
who had placed it on me!

809
02:17:32,010 --> 02:17:33,477
Oh!God! What's all
this happening?

810
02:17:37,682 --> 02:17:47,318
And now,my fellow country men
select another Sultan yourself!

811
02:17:48,693 --> 02:17:49,318
Good bye!

812
02:17:49,861 --> 02:17:58,496
No,We'll not select another Sultan!
No,No,we'll not select another Sultan

813
02:17:58,703 --> 02:18:01,171
Don't go Razia,
don't go!

814
02:18:03,708 --> 02:18:06,506
Let her go...
Iet her go...

815
02:18:07,879 --> 02:18:10,848
If she has relinguished the Crown
and the thrown leaving us

816
02:18:12,384 --> 02:18:15,012
She's a culprit
of we proud Turks!

817
02:18:16,388 --> 02:18:21,348
We the turks are white
and our blood too!

818
02:18:22,060 --> 02:18:30,195
And being white,we can't accept
the relationship of a black!

819
02:18:30,902 --> 02:18:32,699
And she is a daughter
of a Turk!

820
02:18:33,238 --> 02:18:38,039
But she can't see,that the
colour of Yakoot is black!

821
02:18:38,743 --> 02:18:40,711
She considers him
also as a man!

822
02:18:41,579 --> 02:18:44,047
And will not bend infront
of our proudness!

823
02:18:44,749 --> 02:18:47,377
Let her go...
Iet her go!!

824
02:18:48,086 --> 02:19:18,282
Don't go,don't go,you are our pride,
our honour,our glory,our everything

825
02:23:09,847 --> 02:23:12,145
Start Mr.Priest!

826
02:23:13,351 --> 02:23:16,980
Jamaluddeen Yakoot! What's
acceptable as alimony?

827
02:23:20,692 --> 02:23:22,319
Every moment of life

828
02:23:23,695 --> 02:23:27,995
Whatever be the value of each
breath at that breathing time!

829
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:31,168
This is your faithfulness
not the Alimony!

830
02:23:33,705 --> 02:23:36,173
Then,my entire wealth!

831
02:23:59,564 --> 02:24:07,027
Sultan! Razia,l Balban here by has
been appointed as your advocate!

832
02:24:08,406 --> 02:24:14,538
My companion,the priest has
come to know about your acceptance!

833
02:24:17,582 --> 02:24:23,214
Sultan! Hayrath Razia Sultan!
daughter of Altamash!

834
02:24:23,588 --> 02:24:29,220
The proposal from Jamaluddeen
Yakoot the Negro!

835
02:24:30,094 --> 02:24:35,396
At 157 Taga coins
as Alimony!

836
02:24:36,434 --> 02:24:36,900
Is it acceptable?

837
02:24:39,937 --> 02:24:40,733
Tell,Yes!

838
02:24:44,375 --> 02:24:46,400
Do you accept
this proposal?

839
02:24:49,213 --> 02:24:49,838
I accept!

840
02:25:26,984 --> 02:25:37,553
Subedar,lkthiaundden of Altunia has
rebelled against Sultan of Hind!

841
02:25:38,329 --> 02:25:42,595
And has surrounded capital Delhi
from all the 4 sides!

842
02:26:11,696 --> 02:26:16,963
Razia Sultan,you may have come to
know that your enemies have

843
02:26:17,168 --> 02:26:20,831
Made your handicapped step Brother
Behram Shah as the Sultan!

844
02:26:21,205 --> 02:26:23,833
And he is marching forward
against you from the back!

845
02:26:24,041 --> 02:26:24,871
I know!

846
02:26:25,610 --> 02:26:27,874
But,you may not
know that...

847
02:26:28,146 --> 02:26:33,948
Yakoot,when you left back to stop
the march of Behram Shah!

848
02:26:35,219 --> 02:26:38,120
He has been encircled by the
Army of Behram Shah!

849
02:26:38,656 --> 02:26:41,648
And now,you are left alone
to wage against me!

850
02:26:43,528 --> 02:26:45,120
I am one,who
desired you!

851
02:26:46,731 --> 02:26:49,859
Come...Come
towards me!

852
02:26:51,102 --> 02:26:56,039
And try to restore the
damage done by the fate!

853
02:26:56,240 --> 02:26:56,865
Silence!

854
02:26:57,508 --> 02:27:00,705
Razia's fate is completely
Razia's fate!

855
02:27:01,779 --> 02:27:03,212
She is not your
slave!

856
02:27:03,981 --> 02:27:06,381
You have come to wage a War
so wage the War!

857
02:27:23,935 --> 02:27:25,232
Attack the Horseman!!

858
02:27:38,683 --> 02:27:39,911
Stamp out those Horseman!

859
02:27:44,121 --> 02:27:45,145
Archers!!!

860
02:27:55,833 --> 02:27:57,733
Wipe out the foot
solders!

861
02:28:29,734 --> 02:28:31,793
The enemies have
been overhauled!

862
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:35,298
My brave men,take over
the battlefield!

863
02:29:07,371 --> 02:29:09,931
Look,Razia at this
surprise!

864
02:29:10,508 --> 02:29:12,999
How dreaded and
wicked am l?

865
02:29:13,544 --> 02:29:15,774
And what a terrible
mishap I am?

866
02:29:16,213 --> 02:29:16,907
Turn back and see!

867
02:29:48,746 --> 02:29:56,209
Brave men! Spread around the fires like
spilt and separted water streams!

868
02:31:37,488 --> 02:31:40,150
I have brought medicine for
the Sultan's wounds!

869
02:31:40,391 --> 02:31:41,119
Wait for some time!

870
02:31:42,293 --> 02:31:45,729
Let these'flowers'adore my body
for some more time!

871
02:31:54,405 --> 02:31:55,997
Atlast,my move has
been successful!

872
02:31:57,341 --> 02:32:01,607
Your tired army is under the
captivity of my Army!

873
02:32:02,713 --> 02:32:05,181
And you are
in my custody!

874
02:32:06,484 --> 02:32:07,178
Coward!

875
02:32:08,719 --> 02:32:13,850
Cowardice or Bravery,everything
is fair in Love and War!

You white Turk!

878
02:32:23,334 --> 02:32:28,966
The debt of fighting a Negro,which
is still pending against you!

Today,you'll have to settle it
now,here itself!

the skies! come!!!

world for you in the skies!
