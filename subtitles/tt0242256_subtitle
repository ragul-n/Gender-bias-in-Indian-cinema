Today-evening at 5.30

21
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:22,649
Hey! Karthik,are you waiting
for Shakthi?

22
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,649
You could have married
me instead of her

23
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,450
I'll inform Shakthi and
then we'll marry

24
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:28,050
You shameless! Won't you
ever change?!!

25
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,649
Doctor went away already
after her Duty

26
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,250
Did she say anything about
where she was going?

27
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:07,450
She didn't tell anything,
after her duty she left

28
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,450
When did she leave?

29
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,450
At 5.00,I think she would have
been late because of traffic jam

30
00:04:14,649 --> 00:04:15,649
Are you sure,she is not there?

31
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,450
No sir,would you like to
speak to her friend?

32
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,050
No,It's alright,she will come
I'll wait....

33
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,250
Two years back....

Who?! who is he?! who

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:22,650
Like Moon she is bright!!

39
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:29,649
Indiran is batting,he is the one who
scores a sixer with that ball?!

40
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,650
Tell me!!

41
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,649

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,050
Prakash got caught nicely

47
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:32,650
What is lacking in our girl?

48
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,650
I am talking about Ashok

49
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,250
What is lacking in our girl?

50
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,450
Nothing is lacking,Is she
your friend?

51
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:40,850
Then in whom is lacking?
you said that he got caught

52
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,050
That was about this marriage

53
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,450
Oh! that means,marriage is
like a Jail,isn't it?

54
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,050
No,Instead of enjoying life-

55
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,649
Sorry,I think you are also a
Village girl,don't mistake me

56
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,650
Hey! she is a city girl

I thought you are a bit handsome...

00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,649

handsome guys

00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:01,753

63
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:09,450
Look,why the young girl's neck
is sweating?

64
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,450
Who is this girl?
she is very talkative

65
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:19,850
Does she live here?

66
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,649
She is my daughter

67
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,450
I am sparing you because you
are from groom's side

68
00:08:25,649 --> 00:08:26,050
I don't mean that...

69
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,649

73
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:57,250
Hey! He is the king
of your headweight!

74
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,650
Chellamma,where are you?

75
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,650
All get ready,it's getting late to
go to the Temple

76
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,650
Bring the flower garland
and the saree,quickly!

77
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,650
What did you say to my father?
he is very angry

78
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,850
I thought Village girl's will be
soft and calm

79
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,250
Village girl!! Come, she is
very calm & soft

80
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:23,850
Come & dance with me!!

81
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:31,250
Marriage,marriage,the young
girl's marriage!!

82
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:45,649
Marriage,marriage,the young
girl's marriage!!

83
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,850
Why there is an Auspicious thread
for the bride?

84
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,450
Why they are tying 3 knots?

85
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:04,650
The first knot is for the rights!

86
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,450
The second knot is for relationship!!

87
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,050
The third knot is for the world!!

88
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:20,450
Oh! The knot,knot....knot....

89
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,649
What's the need for the Auspicious
thread to the bride?

90
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,650
Why they are tying 3 knots?

91
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:36,850
Who?! who is he?! who
is your future Husband?!

92
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:44,450
Who?! who is the king
of your headweight?!

93
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:01,628
Mother,Is breakfast ready? where is it?

94
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:05,250
Daily,why are you preparing
the same breakfast?

95
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,650
Shut up! don't talk
too much

96
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,050
Close the book while you
are eating

97
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,049
What ever you study,it will not get
into your mind

98
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,049
And your food will also not be
digested

99
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:12,650
No need!!

100
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,850
Sit down,mad girl!

101
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,250
If you keep on scolding me,I'll
not return home in the evening

102
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:19,049
Go! But,don't fall in
front of the train

103
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:19,850
It will be problem to all

104
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:22,250
Will you both stop fighting
for sometime?

105
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,049
If she behaves like you, why
should I fight with her?

106
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,850
See her hair,all dishavilled

107
00:11:26,049 --> 00:11:27,049
Is this my mistake that
hair is dishavilled?

108
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,450
You should have tied it.isn't it?

109
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,450
Your sister is making plats,isn't it?

110
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:32,049
You always support sister,all others
are IInd class citizens for you

111
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,250
Then,why you gave birth to me?
you would have stopped after sister

112
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,450
See her temper

113
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:38,450
She is going to become a Doctor
and patients will be coming to her...

114
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,050
If I was in death bed also,don't
take me to her

115
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,650
Okay,mother

116
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:43,850
What okay?!

117
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:48,049
Leave it,let's go

118
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,250
Mother,Bye

119
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,650
Hey! wait

120
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:57,850
Show your hand

121
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,650
Do your exams well,Go

122
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:06,850
You told me to fall in front
of the train

123
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:09,250
Fighter cock! I said don't fall
infront of the train

124
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:11,450
Sir,what's it?

125
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,650
Shakthi is going for
the exam,that's why....

126
00:12:14,049 --> 00:12:14,850
Oh! that's the reason

127
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,050
Sister,I am coming...

128
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,250
Move,move....

129
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,050
This side...

130
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,505
It's alright

131
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,100
Grandpa,shave your face....
it's disturbing me

132
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:36,700
It will,it will disturb you

133
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,900
Uncle...

134
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:43,900
I educated you & what sort
of work you have done?

135
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:44,508
What?

136
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,475
Do you know,what work your
son has done?

137
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
He is also your son

138
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,299
Do you have doubt?

139
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,700
I was standing near the
spencer signal

140
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
And he & 4 of his friends
were on the bike

141
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,700
I don't know,whether they were
girls or boys

142
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,299
They wear wearing earings....

143
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,299
Full of smoke,do you understand?

144
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,900
What do you know,you & your
father will not understand anything

145
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,700
Why are you talking indirectly?

146
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,300
Mother,father saw me while
I was smoking

147
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Bring me Coffee

148
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,300
Not his cigarette,he was smoking
somebody's cigarette

149
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,700
On his back seat,a girl wearing pant
was there on his bike

150
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,100
They both are sharing
a cigarette

151
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
What a wonderful scene?!

152
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,299
This kind of boy,born
in our family!!

153
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,500
Who was that girl? why are
you giving us shocks?

154
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,300
Mother,he is a guy like
a brother

155
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,300
Hey! That is very dangerous

156
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,299
Grandma,he is Era,
Uncle classmate

157
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,299
You used to tease him
calling `Needle',isn't it?

158
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
Hey! Keep quiet

159
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:40,299
Hey! You smoke & you room anywhere
I am not bothered

160
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,299
Then what?!

161
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,100
Don't smoke with my money
you earn & then smoke

162
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,299
Keep one cigarette in one hand
& another in other hand

163
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,700
You can even keep it on
your ear also

164
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,299
Oh! God! Is smoking a sin?

165
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,900
No,No-It's a virtuous
deed

166
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,300
What do you all think
about me?

167
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Am I printing money?

168
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,100
When I was at his age,I didn't
even have slippers

169
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,299
He is repeating this
for 308th time

170
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,299
My father used to give me
only 25 paise

171
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,700
I'll go to the Hotel & take
a Dosa & Coffee

172
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,500
Then,I'll go to College
by walking

173
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,300
If we give 25 paise in Madras -

174
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,700
Even the beggar will return
it to me -

175
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,700
Father,what's the problem?

176
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:14,700
You have come up with so many
difficulties,isn't it?

177
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Okay,we'll accept it
we'll respect you

178
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,900
But,for that,shouldn't we wear
slippers & walk?

179
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,500
Slowly,you may drop
it down

180
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,900
Karthik,don't talk back

181
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,900
Yes,I am useless

182
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,900
For that,why is he always
finding fault with me?

183
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,900
Come,Come,Raja come!!

184
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,900
Give me your purse

185
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,700
You can talk nicely,but for this
you should come to me

186
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,299
Okay,No need!

187
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,100
Hey! Wait...

188
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:37,700
Look at his haughtiness,In this
age he is like this...

189
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,900
At the age of 30,didn't you
show your anger?

190
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,900
I said a word about your sister,and
you didn't talk to me for 5 years -

191
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,299
He is like you....

192
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,100
Karthik,where are you going?

193
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
I am going to spend my father's
money by smoking

194
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Grandpa,all your property is going
to go in smoke

195
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:13,100
Who is he? Who is your
future husband?

196
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:20,900
Who? Who is the King
of your headweight?

197
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Who? Who is he? Who is
your future husband?

198
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:35,299
Who? Who is the King
of your headweight?

199
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,700
This is very silly?

200
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,700
What is silly? What?

201
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,700
You don't know who she is
and you don't know her name -

202
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,100
You don't know anything

203
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:45,100
How will you find her out in the
Population of 7 Million

204
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,299
In the 7 million Population,how many
women will be there?

205
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,500
Tell me,Tell me

206
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,299
50% means,how many?

207
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
3 1/2 Million

208
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,100
In this 3 1/2 Million Population -

209
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,900
How many women come under
the age group of 18-22?

210
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,100
10% means,how many?

211
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,700
3 1/2 lakhs,you don't know even this?

212
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,700
In this 3 1/2 lakhs,how many
are from Medical College?

213
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,700
Oh! Is she a Doctor?

214
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Tell me,Tell me,how many?

215
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,700
Keep it as 1%

216
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,100
1% means how many? 3500

217
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,700
In this 3500,how many girls
will go by train from Tambaram?

218
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,900
No,there will be atleast 2%

219
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,900
2% means,how many?
-70

220
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:22,500
In these 70 girls,I should
search only one girl

221
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,100
That's the subject matter.
Can we not find her?

222
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:24,900
We can!!

223
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
It might be "Love"

224
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,700
If we see each other,will love occur?
It's all foolishness

225
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,300
Then,whom you saw in the
morning at 8.55-

226
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,700
Why are you talking about him
at 10.30 in the night?

227
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,500
A mad guy is eying me
on the train

228
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:39,900
What can I do for that?

229
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:08,940
Oh! Friend,My friend...

230
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,340
This is not love,its only lust

231
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,420
Hey! You shut up

232
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,500
It's not a true love which
admires only physical beauty

233
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,660
In your body,your hormones
work overtime

234
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,180
Hey! Don't degrade my love

235
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,740
Then,is it true love?

236
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,299
Oh! The love which started
from Electric train,isn't it?

237
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,540
Or love at the first sight?

238
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,740
Hey! You stupid,shut up!

239
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,300
I think,you like him?

240
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,300
Poorni,will I love someone? who has
no other job,they will love

241
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,340
If you talk like this,definitely
you are in love

242
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,700
It is seen on your face

243
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,380
What's it?

244
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,299
Suddenly,40 watts brightness
has come

245
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,220
Hey shut up!

246
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,180
You shut up!

247
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,340
Shakthi,see whether the
station has come?

248
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,300
Look!

249
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,300
See carefully,he will be
somewhere around

250
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,780
Didn't I tell you,he has
not come,I know

251
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:07,620
He must have come

252
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,299
Really!!

253
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,299
He will be here only

254
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,340
Hey! Look there!

255
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,580
Oh! Friend,my friend!

256
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,500
Oh! Friend,my friend!

257
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,460
Shall I ask him?

258
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,780
Go inside

259
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,740
Whom do you want?

260
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,620
Shakthi?!!

261
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,299
Shakthi! Isn't it?

262
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,860
You are insulting me!

263
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,740
Your Devadas is coming...

264
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:38,900
I am not loving you

265
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,100
I don't like you

266
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,940
I never thought that
you are beautiful

267
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,299
But,I am afraid if all
this may come true

268
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,380
Think & tell me...

269
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,580
I am not loving you

270
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,140
I never thought that
you are beautiful

271
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,260
But,I am afraid if all
this may become true

272
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,260
He has come here also

273
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,540
We'll wait here, Go
and talk to him

274
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,940
Where are you going?
-to accompany her

275
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:15,940
What's your name?

276
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,020
Karthik

277
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,299
Okay,are you rich?

278
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,260
Are you the failing student of the class?
did you fail frequently?

279
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:27,900
Because,such foolish rich guys only-

280
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,660
Room behind a girl
who have no work

281
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,900
Oh! Friend,my friend!!

You will say`yes' to me!

The nose of the parrot is the tongue
of the young girl!!

292
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,300
The new Rose Flower-

Is the baby's foot which has
not yet touched the earth!!

294
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:37,300
All red colour shows your Anger!!

295
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,299
The evening sky which is
`Yellow'

00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,900
The`Yellow'which has blossomed
in the kindling of fire!!

The colour of the plant leucas
which is drenched in the rain!!

324
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,020
Oh! White colour,white colour! You are

The colour of the plant leucas
which is drenched in the rain!!

326
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:53,700
Your "Heart" is of pure
white colour!

327
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,100
Grandpa,shave your face....
it's disturbing me

328
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:36,700
It will,it will disturb you

329
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,900
Uncle...

330
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:43,900
I educated you & what sort
of work you have done?

331
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:44,508
What?

332
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,475
Do you know,what work your
son has done?

333
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,500
He is also your son

334
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,299
Do you have doubt?

335
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:51,700
I was standing near the
spencer signal

336
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
And he & 4 of his friends
were on the bike

337
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,700
I don't know,whether they were
girls or boys

338
00:12:56,299 --> 00:12:58,299
They wear wearing earings....

339
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,299
Full of smoke,do you understand?

340
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,900
What do you know,you & your
father will not understand anything

341
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,700
Why are you talking indirectly?

342
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,300
Mother,father saw me while
I was smoking

343
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,700
Bring me Coffee

344
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,300
Not his cigarette,he was smoking
somebody's cigarette

345
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,700
On his back seat,a girl wearing pant
was there on his bike

346
00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:16,100
They both are sharing
a cigarette

347
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
What a wonderful scene?!

348
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,299
This kind of boy,born
in our family!!

349
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,500
Who was that girl? why are
you giving us shocks?

350
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,300
Mother,he is a guy like
a brother

351
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,300
Hey! That is very dangerous

352
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,299
Grandma,he is Era,
Uncle classmate

353
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,299
You used to tease him
calling `Needle',isn't it?

354
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,300
Hey! Keep quiet

355
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:40,299
Hey! You smoke & you room anywhere
I am not bothered

356
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,299
Then what?!

357
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,100
Don't smoke with my money
you earn & then smoke

358
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,299
Keep one cigarette in one hand
& another in other hand

359
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,700
You can even keep it on
your ear also

360
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,299
Oh! God! Is smoking a sin?

361
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,900
No,No-It's a virtuous
deed

362
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,300
What do you all think
about me?

363
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Am I printing money?

364
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,100
When I was at his age,I didn't
even have slippers

365
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,299
He is repeating this
for 308th time

366
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,299
My father used to give me
only 25 paise

367
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,700
I'll go to the Hotel & take
a Dosa & Coffee

368
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,500
Then,I'll go to College
by walking

369
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,300
If we give 25 paise in Madras -

370
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,700
Even the beggar will return
it to me -

371
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,700
Father,what's the problem?

372
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:14,700
You have come up with so many
difficulties,isn't it?

373
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Okay,we'll accept it
we'll respect you

374
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,900
But,for that,shouldn't we wear
slippers & walk?

375
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,500
Slowly,you may drop
it down

376
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,900
Karthik,don't talk back

377
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,900
Yes,I am useless

378
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,900
For that,why is he always
finding fault with me?

379
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,900
Come,Come,Raja come!!

380
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,900
Give me your purse

381
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,700
You can talk nicely,but for this
you should come to me

382
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,299
Okay,No need!

383
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,100
Hey! Wait...

384
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:37,700
Look at his haughtiness,In this
age he is like this...

385
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,900
At the age of 30,didn't you
show your anger?

386
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,900
I said a word about your sister,and
you didn't talk to me for 5 years -

387
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:47,299
He is like you....

388
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,100
Karthik,where are you going?

389
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
I am going to spend my father's
money by smoking

390
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Grandpa,all your property is going
to go in smoke

391
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:13,100
Who is he? Who is your
future husband?

392
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:20,900
Who? Who is the King
of your headweight?

393
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:28,100
Who? Who is he? Who is
your future husband?

394
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:35,299
Who? Who is the King
of your headweight?

395
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,700
This is very silly?

396
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,700
What is silly? What?

397
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,700
You don't know who she is
and you don't know her name -

398
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,100
You don't know anything

399
00:15:43,299 --> 00:15:45,100
How will you find her out in the
Population of 7 Million

400
00:15:45,299 --> 00:15:48,299
In the 7 million Population,how many
women will be there?

401
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,500
Tell me,Tell me

402
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,299
50% means,how many?

403
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,500
3 1/2 Million

404
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,100
In this 3 1/2 Million Population -

405
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,900
How many women come under
the age group of 18-22?

406
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,100
10% means,how many?

407
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,700
3 1/2 lakhs,you don't know even this?

408
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,700
In this 3 1/2 lakhs,how many
are from Medical College?

409
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,700
Oh! Is she a Doctor?

410
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
Tell me,Tell me,how many?

411
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,700
Keep it as 1%

412
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,100
1% means how many? 3500

413
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,700
In this 3500,how many girls
will go by train from Tambaram?

414
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,900
No,there will be atleast 2%

415
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,900
2% means,how many?
-70

416
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:22,500
In these 70 girls,I should
search only one girl

417
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,100
That's the subject matter.
Can we not find her?

418
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:24,900
We can!!

419
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
It might be "Love"

420
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,700
If we see each other,will love occur?
It's all foolishness

421
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:34,300
Then,whom you saw in the
morning at 8.55-

422
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,700
Why are you talking about him
at 10.30 in the night?

423
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,500
A mad guy is eying me
on the train

424
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:39,900
What can I do for that?

425
00:16:53,420 --> 00:17:08,940
Oh! Friend,My friend...

426
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,340
This is not love,its only lust

427
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,420
Hey! You shut up

428
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,500
It's not a true love which
admires only physical beauty

429
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,660
In your body,your hormones
work overtime

430
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,180
Hey! Don't degrade my love

431
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,740
Then,is it true love?

432
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,299
Oh! The love which started
from Electric train,isn't it?

433
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,540
Or love at the first sight?

434
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,740
Hey! You stupid,shut up!

435
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,300
I think,you like him?

436
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,300
Poorni,will I love someone? who has
no other job,they will love

437
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,340
If you talk like this,definitely
you are in love

438
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,700
It is seen on your face

439
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,380
What's it?

440
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,299
Suddenly,40 watts brightness
has come

441
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,220
Hey shut up!

442
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:55,180
You shut up!

443
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,340
Shakthi,see whether the
station has come?

444
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,300
Look!

445
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,300
See carefully,he will be
somewhere around

446
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,780
Didn't I tell you,he has
not come,I know

447
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:07,620
He must have come

448
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:10,299
Really!!

449
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,299
He will be here only

450
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,340
Hey! Look there!

451
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:37,580
Oh! Friend,my friend!

452
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,500
Oh! Friend,my friend!

453
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,460
Shall I ask him?

454
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,780
Go inside

455
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:09,740
Whom do you want?

456
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,620
Shakthi?!!

457
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,299
Shakthi! Isn't it?

458
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:18,860
You are insulting me!

459
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,740
Your Devadas is coming...

460
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:38,900
I am not loving you

461
00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:40,100
I don't like you

462
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,940
I never thought that
you are beautiful

463
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,299
But,I am afraid if all
this may come true

464
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,380
Think & tell me...

465
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:51,580
I am not loving you

466
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,140
I never thought that
you are beautiful

467
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,260
But,I am afraid if all
this may become true

468
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,260
He has come here also

469
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,540
We'll wait here, Go
and talk to him

470
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,940
Where are you going?
-to accompany her

471
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:15,940
What's your name?

472
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,020
Karthik

473
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,299
Okay,are you rich?

474
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,260
Are you the failing student of the class?
did you fail frequently?

475
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:27,900
Because,such foolish rich guys only-

476
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:29,660
Room behind a girl
who have no work

477
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:38,900

The nose of the parrot is the tongue
of the young girl!!

Is the baby's foot which has
not yet touched the earth!!

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,170
Hey! Who are these girls?

524
00:29:29,449 --> 00:29:30,850
She is the one whom I
am going to Marry!!

525
00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:33,610
Which one?

526
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,050
This side,who is wearing
violet colour saree

527
00:29:38,407 --> 00:29:39,583
You are going to marry her
seriously?!

528
00:29:39,774 --> 00:29:40,175
Definitely

529
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:43,250
This is the girl,whom Karthik
is going to marry!!

530
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:50,850
The bright moon is burning
like a Sun...

531
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:53,410
Aunty,this is the girl whom
Karthik is going to marry!

532
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:54,050
Who is that girl?

533
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:58,450
Dinesh,Is Karthik going to marry
that girl?

534
00:29:58,650 --> 00:29:59,050
What?

535
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,050
The girl who is singing,that girl

536
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,449
Congratulations sir!!

537
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,450
It seems your son & that
girl are going to marry!

538
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:06,478
You didn't even inform us...

539
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:08,450
Balu,What's it?

540
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,330
Karthik is going to marry
that girl only...

541
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:11,449
That girl!!
-Yes

542
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,010
How can you say like this?

543
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:17,930
I didn't say that you are
eager to marry me

544
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,250
I said,I am eager to marry you

545
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:20,250
This is true,isn't it?

546
00:30:20,449 --> 00:30:21,250
Madam,is it wrong?

547
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:23,449
No

548
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,449
Sister,keep quiet

549
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,450
You could have asked me
directly,isn't it?

550
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,650
Okay,I'll ask now

551
00:30:27,449 --> 00:30:27,850
Don't want

552
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,770
When I didn't ask,you are angry

553
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:30,930
And if I come to ask you
you are saying,I don't want

554
00:30:31,449 --> 00:30:33,050
Why are you suddenly
talking about marriage?

555
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:38,650
Come

556
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,449
Hey! Shall I tell you?

557
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,250
What?

558
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,050
It means? What do you mean?

559
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,449
I love you means
I love you!!

560
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:54,650
Without knowing its meaning...

561
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,170
It means,I can do
anything for you!

562
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:58,449
Will you jump down
from the train?

563
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,170
No

564
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:01,250
Then?

565
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:02,850
Now,what are you saying?

566
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:05,449
Do we have to love,now?

567
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,650
I don't know,but "I love you"

568
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:16,930
Play

569
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:22,449
Father,If a groom of a rich family
comes to see me

570
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:23,050
What will you say?

571
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:23,930
What do you mean?

572
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,449
Why are you blabbering?

573
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,050
No,mother,if they come to
our house for fixing alliance

574
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:30,690
What are you gesturing
to each other?

575
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:34,450
Poorni,you tell me...

576
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,250
Shakthi,come here

577
00:31:35,449 --> 00:31:36,450
I am going to study

578
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,850
Yes,father,they are going to
come & fix the marriage

579
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,050
Marriage? Whose?

580
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,050
Tomorrow,they are coming to
our house

581
00:31:43,449 --> 00:31:44,650
But,not for me,for Shakthi

582
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:47,650
Varadharajan,a Popular Lawyer

583
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,930
His son,Karthik...

584
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:51,850
Shakthi,Is it true what Poorni says?

585
00:31:53,099 --> 00:31:53,500
Tell me

586
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,900
Have I educated you for this?

587
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,500
For this purpose only,have we borrowed
money & put you in the Medical College?

588
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,900
Mother,I didn't call anyone,they
are coming on their own -

589
00:32:07,099 --> 00:32:07,500
What can I do?

590
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,820
You have only encouraged someone,that's why
they are coming here

591
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,780
I didn't encourage anyone
you always find fault with me!

592
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:13,900
Mother,Karthik is a good guy
you,shut up

593
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,100
To educate you,she didn't marry
and is going to the office -

594
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,500
Do you know that?

595
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:19,820
Mother,don't scold me

596
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,100
This year's college fee's is paid
from her loan

597
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,740
She herself didn't marry,Why
are you in a hurry?

598
00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:27,099
You have selected a boy...

599
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,099
Is this the place?
-Yes sir

600
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,260
They said 511,isn't it?-Yes

601
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:51,100
Park the car in the shade

602
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:57,900
Come,come

603
00:32:58,099 --> 00:32:58,465
Greetings

604
00:32:58,849 --> 00:32:59,329
Sit down

605
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,100
Are you fine?

606
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,100
Yes,please sit down

607
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,099
We thought that we have come
to the wrong house -

608
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,860
In quarters,all houses look same
that's why I am confused

609
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,660
This is the standard of
middle class family

610
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:15,740
She is Saroja

611
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:16,860
Greetings

612
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,099
They both are my daughters

613
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,980
We know them,they have come
to my house

614
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,099
They even sang song

615
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,099
Really!

616
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,700
Sit down,Sit down

617
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:27,980
I don't know
I won't watch all that

618
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,300
All are secret plans

619
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,099
They tortured me a lot to see her
that's why,I came...

620
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,340
Shall we get coffee?

621
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:39,860
You sit down

622
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,420
Madam,I want coffee without sugar
She won't have it

623
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:49,620
Among these two girls,which one our
son is loving?

624
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,220
He will not remember faces

625
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,100
Even when I return from my brother's
house after 2 days -

626
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,140
He will ask me "Who are you"?

627
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,460
Younger girl Shakthi!!

628
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,340
Okay

629
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,140
Haven't you fixed the alliance for
the elder daughter?

630
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,020
No

631
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,780
Is it?

632
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:07,620
Do you prefer arranged marriage or
else like your sister -

633
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:10,940
Without giving financial burden to
your parents,you will love someone

634
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,740
What are you talking?

635
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,580
There is no harm in asking her view

636
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,700
Asking questions is my
Profession

637
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,820
They call him as a criminal lawyer

638
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:21,099
May be you will earn money
by telling lots of lies

639
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,620
I have brought up my son as
a successful advocate's son

640
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:41,260
I have brought up my daughters
as Queens

641
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:42,980
We don't have that status...But...

642
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,099
Coffee may become cold,take it

643
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,460
If Queen's father starts talking
he will keep on talking...

644
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,540
Let him talk

645
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:51,099
What I am trying to say is...

646
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,100
When the children attain the
age of 20 -

647
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,020
There's no need to ask you & me
to take a decision

648
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,099
That is the law,I had brought him up
by teaching the law

649
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,940
Sir,I didn't bring up my
daughters like that

650
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,099
You have mistaken me

651
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,060
I am explaining to you
the law

652
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,380
Not only your daughter but for any
girl going on the road

653
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,099
If Karthik says
"I will marry her"

654
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,420
We can't do anything we must
accept the choice of that donkey

655
00:35:24,820 --> 01:10:43,440
Lawyer sir,what do you mean -

656
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,260
Are you pointing out that you are
rich and we are beggars?

657
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,020
Sir,when did you get this
proudness?!!

658
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,900
When you completed your education?!

659
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,420
Or after earning money?!!

660
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,660
Father!!

661
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,500
He has come to our house
and he is saying -

662
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,980
That our girl and the girl on
the road are same!

663
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:42,180
Mr.Selvaraj,you have mistaken me

664
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,300
I have mistaken you?

665
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,100
Sir,you are only talking
in a wrong way

666
00:35:46,099 --> 00:35:50,420
I have come here to talk about
your daughter and my son

667
00:35:51,099 --> 00:35:54,700
I didn't come here to talk about
our inferiority & Superiority complexes

668
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,099
My son is a Computer Engineer,I thought
he will rise to greater heights

669
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,820
I didn't expect that he will
indulge in love affair

670
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,980
Sir,no one has laid a bait
for your son's love

671
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:15,100
For a while,we'll not
discuss about this

672
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:18,100
If my son ask me,what should
I reply? Tell me that

673
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,260
Tell him that we are honest
people,its enough

674
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,300
Hey! What happened?

675
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
I think it won't suit us
we'll leave it

676
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,099
We'll forget everything and
let us remain friends

677
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,500
We'll say bye to each other

678
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,099
Because of this,will the earth
stop functioning?

679
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,420
Did my father say anything
incorrectly?

680
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:43,100
Nothing was good,they talked
incorrectly

681
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,500
They talked beyond their
limits

682
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:46,700
It was like a talk between
India & Pakistan

683
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,740
Shakthi,are they both going
to marry?

684
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,060
Only I & you are going
to marry

685
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,099
We asked their permission just
for a formality,that's all

686
00:36:54,099 --> 00:36:55,099
Karthik,what do you want me
to do?

687
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,100
If they didn't give respect to our love
we'll leave them

688
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,099
But,I can't

689
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,099
What! You can't?

690
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,900
I can't leave my Parents,my house
and my dog..

691
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,420
That means...

692
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,740
This love is not a big thing to you
isn't it?

693
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,099
From when do you know me?

694
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,099
For 20 weeks...

695
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:19,099
But my Parents are like my soul
for 20 years

696
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,700
I can't leave "Them" for "You"

697
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,260
But,I can leave "Anything"
for"you"!!

698
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Today,for a girl,you are ready to
leave your parents & come -

699
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,340
Tomorrow,for another girl you
will not leave me

700
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:38,900
What's the guarantee for it?

701
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,700
Hello,your logic is horrible

702
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,099
Now,what? Sacrifice?
Am I its offering?

703
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,700
Why our love is so deep?

704
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,300
We met each other & talked

705
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,099
You were after me for sometime
and you made me happy

706
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,300
But now,you are making me to cry!!
That's it!

707
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,820
Earlier,If I said "No" to you what
would you have done?

708
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,420
I would have thought you are
not lucky

709
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,099
Now,you think like that

710
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,900
Shakthi,what you are saying
is right

711
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:02,099
I accept that love is foolish...
but don't leave me..

712
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,100
Give me some more time

713
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,340
For one week,till 10th...

714
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,700
After that also,if you feel like this
tell me

715
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:07,700
We'll leave it

716
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,820
What will happen in one week?
Why unnecessarily...

717
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:10,580
Anything may happen within
one week..

718
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,100
Hey! Be careful!

719
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,900
I may convince you,you may change

720
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,099
or I may fall in love
with someone

721
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:16,900
Hey! What are you doing?

722
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:18,099
Shakthi,only one week,okay?

723
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,100
Simply we'll meet & talk
that's all,okay?!

724
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,100
No

Hey! Keep quiet,I am talking

729
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:44,799
Do you know,where is Shakthi?

730
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,000
No,she has gone from the
hospital around 5.30

731
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,200
Has she not yet come
to the house?

732
00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:53,799
No,I am calling from outside,she
might have gone home by this time

733
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:08,800
Is Raji there?

734
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,040
Hai Karthik,I am Raji speaking

735
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:12,799
How is Shakthi?

736

How about you?

737
00:40:19,799 --> 00:40:20,200
You are very busy,isn't it?

738
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,800
You are not coming to
meet us

739
00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:24,800
They said,you have given
birth to a child

740
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,799
Yes,baby girl

741
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,000

Karthik,don't want this

744
00:47:19,099 --> 00:47:27,900
Someone is playing the music!!

745
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:38,099
I am staying in the darkness
and listening to it!!

746
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:42,580
I am doing meditation & thinking
about it!!

747
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:47,700
I am loving that in instalments!!

748
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:15,099
Some one is playing the music...

749
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,300
Sir,where is the medical camp?

750
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:19,300
They have gone to
some other place

751
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:23,100
Someone is playing the music...

752
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:27,099
I am staying in the darkness
and listening to it!!

753
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,099
I am doing Meditation & thinking
about it

754
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,580
I am loving that in Instalments

755
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:40,099
By listening to it,I got
mesmerised

756
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,099
But,he didn't know that
I am listening to it!!

757
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:52,700
In the Bamboo forest,I am
not able to understand his music...

758
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,500
Some one is playing the music...

759
00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:00,500
I am staying in the darkness and
listening to it!

760
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:44,700
Oh! Flute,flower flute!! "You & Me"
belong to same religion!

761
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:56,900
Oh! Flute,flower flute!! "You & Me"
belong to same religion!

762
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:05,099
Oh! Flute!! The craving in you
is equal to mine!!

763
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:13,700
With this sweet Melody,I'll
forget my sorrows!!

764
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:22,100
If this melodious music was not here
I would have died long back!

765
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,100
Some one is playing the Music...!!

766
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,100
I am staying in the darkness
and listening to it!!

767
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:36,271
Why you took so many days
to search me?!!

768
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:40,850
I can't be separated from you!!
I can't live without you!!

769
00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:41,794
Really!!

770
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:46,850
Can you do anything for me?!!

771
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,050
What? Will you ask me to jump down
from the train?

772
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:54,850
Marry me!!

773
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:59,449

774
00:52:00,250 --> 00:52:00,850
Let it be a secret!

775
00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:04,050
Say "Yes"

776
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:05,650
We'll tell them at the
right time

777
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:07,930
Are you asking me for a secret marriage?!!

778
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,250
If they propose me to someone...

779
00:52:13,449 --> 00:52:14,650
Are you telling this
seriously?

780
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,449
After marriage,no one can
separate us!!

781
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:21,050
What are you saying?

782
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:24,650
If Doctor said,then okay!!

783
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:26,450
Really?

784
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:45,449
Hey! Bride!!

785
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:47,850
I am scared

786
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,850
What's this? We have arranged
everything...

787
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:52,410
I am scared...

788
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:53,650
How will I manage,I
don't know?

789
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,449
I'll give a slap,then you
will know it

790
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:57,770
That day,when I asked you
you said "Nothing"

791
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:01,450
Then today when all are waiting
you are saying I am scared..

792
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,050
Poorni,I don't know how
will I manage?

793
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,050
You have already decided.You
will manage it,come

794
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:13,330
What's this? You are wearing
a saree surprisingly?

795
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:14,050
Where?

796
00:53:14,250 --> 00:53:16,330
Where will we go? I am going
to Bank & she is going to Hospital

797
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:18,050
Come,my daughter-in-law

00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,650
I am the Patient,give me
the injection

799
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,050
My father has not left
any property for me

800
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,650
He didn't leave any money
for me

801
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:28,650
He has given diabetes
to me

802
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:31,850
If you come to my house
as daughter-in-law

803
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,449
I don't want to come here frequently
my bus fare can be saved

804
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:37,650
If she comes as daughter-in-law,she
may give you some other injection

805
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,850
Be careful,have coffee & go

806
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:42,930
What's it?
-Nothing

807
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:51,650
Where are you going like a Queen?

808
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:54,250
Thank God! I thought I had to go
without seeing you...

809
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:55,050
Time is up...

810
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:56,850
Father,bye

811
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:57,650
Okay

812
00:53:58,449 --> 00:53:59,650
What happened to that
Lal's case?

813
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:01,050
He is not to be found,we'll
have an agreement

814
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:03,250
Last time itself,the Judge
was upset...

815
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:04,650
Sir,where are you going?

816
00:54:05,090 --> 00:54:05,850

819
00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:08,050

820
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,930
Come,I'll drop you

821
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,050
No,you go to the court
start the car...

822
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:18,050
I'll drop you,get in,you will
waste money on an auto?

823
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,850
Bus has come,we are going
to miss it

824
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:24,449
No one will see,isn't it?

825
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:25,449
You are mad...

826
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:30,530
Shall we go back home?

827
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:33,250

Yes,uncle

830
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,449
Both the parents don't know
about this?

831
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:44,449
Then,the friends alone will be there
with them,isn't it?

832
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:45,250
Yes

833
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,450
This is also a new experience

834
00:54:47,410 --> 00:54:49,850
Daily,I am bored sitting in
the registrar's office

835
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:51,650
This will be excitement,isn't it?

836
00:54:53,610 --> 00:54:55,770
My son,what are you
going to do?

837

Nothing

838
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:02,050

I said,remove your hand

874
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:32,899
No,I am....

875
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,780
Don't tell all these stories..
Get up-

876
00:58:34,899 --> 00:58:37,500
Come, sitdown

877
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,300
If the young girls come alone
the guys will come immediately

878
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,700
Look,how he is seeing
you?

879
00:58:45,899 --> 00:58:47,140
He touched your hand,isn't it?

880
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,700
We should not leave these
kind of guys

881
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,899
Sister,Are you married!
yes

882
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,100
I pity your Husband

883
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:55,980
What did you say?

884
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,300
I know

885
00:59:18,899 --> 00:59:20,300
What's the use of understanding it
give me an answer

886
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,100
Now,I am on duty

887
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:23,300
This is also a duty

888
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:25,380
Who's it?

889
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,100
Tell me

890
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:29,300
Say`I love you'!!

891
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:31,295
Now!!

892
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:32,486
If it's true,tell me

893
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,620
Now,I can't tell you

894
00:59:34,899 --> 00:59:35,300
Why you can't?

895
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:38,100
Doctor,you get away!!!

896
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,380
Karthik,I am going to putdown
the phone

897
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:40,899
Why? People are around you?

898
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:44,500
Okay,then,say it in whisper
Yes or No?

899
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:45,780
Yes!!

900
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:46,780
Tell me,`Yes'

901
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,540
I said`Yes' to you

902
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:54,540
She will not say it!!

903
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:57,500
What? Haven't she said?

904
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:58,700
Hey! Do your work

905
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:16,140
Only 2 minutes more,I have asked
Poorni to wait at the Bus stop

906
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:18,900
Are you waiting for me
for a long time?

907
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,700
For these "2 minutes"I can
wait for"2 Hours"!!

908
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:28,900
Shall I go?

909
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:30,899
No,don't go

910
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:39,899
Oh! My friend! My secret friend!!

911
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:48,700
Oh! Friend!! Listen to my
small,small wishes...

912
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:52,700
This same way of embracing me!!

913
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:56,500
This same way of hugging me!!

914
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:08,100
I want this,till the end
of our life!!

915
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:12,620
Oh! My friend! My friend!!

916
01:01:12,899 --> 01:01:16,780
My secret friend!!

917
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:41,780
Do small,small love things
beyond your limits!!

918
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:46,300
Blossom my cells by
your actions!!

919
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:51,700
Among the flower,you blossom!

920
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:55,780
Like the priest,who is plucking flowers! slowly...

921
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:00,100
When I am sleeping,you
nip my nails!!

922
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,500
You sleep without any
sound!!

923
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:14,899
You should apply Olive oil
to me

924
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:23,500
When you cry,If I also cry,I need
your fingers to wipe off my tears!!

925
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:33,300
Oh! Friend!! My friend!!
my secret friend!!

926
01:02:33,899 --> 01:02:41,780
Oh! Friend! Listen to my
small,small wishes....

927
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:47,700
Yesterday,In your Moon
you were on my lap....

928
01:02:47,899 --> 01:02:55,300
Can the air come in between us
Oh! I was enjoined with my soul!!

929
01:02:57,100 --> 01:03:01,500
Today,In your Moon,with
the drenched thoughts...

930
01:03:01,899 --> 01:03:09,899
I am restless,Oh! My heart
is raving!!

931
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:19,899
In your remembarance and in
your beautiful tradition!!

932
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:27,899
My Pride vanquished,my
Pride vanquished!!

933
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:37,780
What all you said,I'll do it
in the morning!!

934
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:41,900
What all you said,I'll do it
in the morning!!

935
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,900
Even what you didn't say,I'll do it
in the night!!

936
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:51,700
I'll love you & make you
to love!!

937
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:55,860
I'll roam by wearing
your shirt!!

938
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:00,100
When you take bath,I'll also
get wet a little!!

939
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:05,540
I'll carry you on my back!!

940
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:08,100
I'll gather you fully-

941
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:15,100
I'll cover you on my hand and I'll
hide you inside the kercheif!!

942
01:04:15,300 --> 01:04:19,899
When you come outside,I'll
release you!!

943
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:23,900
And I'll fulfil my wish!!

944
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:28,500
Oh! My friend!! My friend!!

945
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:32,700
My secret friend!!

946
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:41,900
Oh! Friend!! Listen to my
small,small wishes...

947
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,740
Uncle it's she...

948
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:01,700
Wait

949
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:07,649
Don't think that
Poorni is quiet girl!

950
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:09,610
If she starts talking,she'll
discuss about the Whole world!

951
01:05:10,290 --> 01:05:12,450
There's only one problem,
she is very intelligent -

952
01:05:12,649 --> 01:05:14,290
For that you'll have to co-operate
its possible,isn't it?

953
01:05:15,010 --> 01:05:15,570
I'll try

954
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:21,810
Shakthi being the last kid,her father with his
indulgence brought her up differently!

955
01:05:22,530 --> 01:05:23,690
But Poorni is
not like that -

956
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,330
She is patient
and a humble girl -

957
01:05:26,425 --> 01:05:29,800
She goes to the Bank for her job and
she's also very responsible in her house

958
01:05:30,633 --> 01:05:31,745
She doesn't get
angry at all

959
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,210
What about our Raghu Brother
he is a complete Saint

960
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:37,930
Because of him,I have
a bad name

961
01:05:38,649 --> 01:05:42,570
From our side its okay
What,Raghu,is it fine?

962
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:45,170
We'll have to ask Poornima whether she
likes,and is it okay to her?

963
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:46,250
Poorni will agree for it -

964
01:05:46,490 --> 01:05:48,450
Don't worry
about that

965
01:05:48,649 --> 01:05:49,050
Please...

966
01:05:49,649 --> 01:05:50,290
Tell,Uncle!

967
01:05:51,130 --> 01:05:54,210
If its okay from your side,on an
Auspicious day,we'll fix the marriage

968
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:57,850
You like,isn't it?
come on tell!

969
01:05:58,090 --> 01:05:59,410
Isn't he handsome?
Isn't he intelligent?

970
01:05:59,649 --> 01:06:02,010
I have given the groom coffee
should I give him the kercheif also?

971
01:06:03,210 --> 01:06:05,649
No after seeing our Poornima
he's becoming eulogical!

972
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:07,649
Ay,look at Uncle

973
01:06:09,649 --> 01:06:11,930
While talking this,I'll tell
what I felt in my heart!...

974
01:06:12,290 --> 01:06:13,649
I didn't even talk to
Shyam about this -

975
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:17,290
You also have one more daughter
I too have one more son -

976
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:20,290
He is also studying medicine
even she is studying Medicine -

977
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,130
Let's ask both about
their opinions -

978
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,770
If they like.we can perform both
the marriages at a time!

979
01:06:25,649 --> 01:06:26,210
What do you say?

980
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,290
Madam

981
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:31,250
Don't mistake me I said
what I felt in my heart!

982
01:06:44,490 --> 01:06:46,290
Come Shakthi come,don't
think Aunty,come

983
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:47,930
Good occassions come
like this only...

984
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:48,850
Mother!
-Wait!

985
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:51,210
Do they know that you have a groom
ready in your relatives itself -

986
01:06:51,650 --> 01:06:52,530
Mother,its not possible

987
01:06:52,649 --> 01:06:53,130
It's possible,you go

988
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:53,970
Listen to me...

989
01:06:54,170 --> 01:06:56,250
Go,he is more educated than me
stays in America

990
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:00,770
I can buy only the map of
America for Shakthi

991
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:02,930
If something good has to happen,certain
useless have to be discarded

992
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:04,649
Mother,listen to what I say
atleast once?

993
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:06,290
First remove

994
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:09,250
Mother,please listen to
what I say?

995
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:11,050
You don't say anything
you have an evil tongue

996
01:07:11,850 --> 01:07:13,650
Mother what's this uncivilized?
Going for two,silly!

997
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:15,370
Remove it
-Why?

998
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:17,810
You should atleast wear a
Silk saree and some jewels

999
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:18,570
Should you be
like this jewel less?

1000
01:07:19,010 --> 01:07:20,649
What's this? All this time I was
like this,isn't it? -

1001
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:21,650
Now,why this
silk saree?

1002
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:23,450
I'll remove!

1003
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:24,450
Take

1004
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,649
Wear them on your ear,and
around the neck

1005
01:07:29,450 --> 01:07:30,410
This is very indecent

1006
01:07:30,649 --> 01:07:32,530
Is this a discount business
buy one and take one free

1007
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,649
Mother,its not possible listen
to what I say

1008
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:36,970
Don't spoil the Poorni's proposal

1009
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:47,450
Come

1010
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:51,450
Come...

1011
01:07:55,130 --> 02:15:45,980
She is feeling shy

1012
01:07:57,930 --> 01:07:58,570
Suddenly

1013
01:07:58,850 --> 01:07:59,970
After hearing to
the proposal...

1014
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:06,649
I am sorry,its a
little embarrasing

1015
01:08:07,930 --> 01:08:09,450
Had I knew,that they'll trap
me like this...

1016
01:08:12,370 --> 01:08:15,090
Father is always like this,he'll
burst out whatever he feels

1017
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:24,010
If I tell you honestly all my
family members have a fear -

1018
01:08:24,570 --> 01:08:27,850
Whether,I'll marry some U.S girl
a black girl etc...

1019
01:08:28,410 --> 01:08:31,450
That's why with Raghu's marriage
they are trapping me also!

1020
01:08:35,330 --> 01:08:36,250
Had they said
it yesterday

1021
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:42,570
But today after seeing you

1022
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:46,649
I don't find anything wrong in it!

1023
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:51,850
What happened?

1024
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,649
You talked a lot when you
wore a Churidhar

1025
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,649
Now,after wearing a Saree
you have become speechless

1026
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:09,210
Tell me truthfully whether
I am okay or not?

1027
01:09:24,504 --> 01:09:24,940
I have....

1028
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:27,450
I am already married!!

1029
01:09:42,810 --> 01:09:43,890
Parent's don't know
about it

1030
01:09:54,850 --> 01:09:55,649
Leave me alone!

1031
01:10:35,810 --> 01:10:38,649
Sir,what's this...?

1032
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:40,050
Father...

1033
01:10:52,649 --> 01:10:58,610
TODAY - NUNGAMBAKKAM RAILWAY
STATION NIGHT 10.20 PM

1034
01:11:59,790 --> 01:12:02,678
Today - Shakthi's residence - night 10.50 pm

1035
01:12:02,927 --> 01:12:03,989
Shakthi,come out!

1036
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:09,030
Whom do you want?

1037
01:12:11,137 --> 01:12:11,856
Where is Shakthi?

1038
01:12:12,849 --> 01:12:13,730
No such person lives here

1039
01:12:14,849 --> 01:12:15,330
Please leave

1040
01:12:17,890 --> 01:12:18,849
Enough of your
drama

1041
01:12:19,887 --> 01:12:20,768
Ask shakthi to come

1042
01:12:21,730 --> 01:12:22,930
It was you,who played the drama -

1043
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:26,130
This house broke and
split into pieces -

1044
01:12:27,130 --> 01:12:28,690
With what face have
you come here?

1045
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:39,170
Shakthi,come out

1046
01:12:44,490 --> 01:12:45,570
I can't beg more
than this

1047
01:12:46,849 --> 01:12:47,330
What happened?

1048
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:50,690
Shakthi what should I do?

1049
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:52,850
Should I kneel and beg?

1050
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:54,410
Where is Shakthi?

1051
01:12:56,009 --> 01:12:56,729
Where is Poorni?

1052
01:13:03,010 --> 01:13:03,850
Poorni where is Shakthi?

1053
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:06,849
Poorni,tell me where is
Shakthi hiding?

1054
01:13:22,250 --> 01:13:22,849
Where is Shakthi?

1055
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:26,450
Didn't Shakthi
come here?

1056
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:28,290
What are you talking?

1057
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:31,849
Are you questioning me after
separating my daughter from me?

1058
01:13:34,130 --> 01:13:35,570
She left the hospital
by 5.30 -

1059
01:13:39,450 --> 01:13:39,849
Still she hasn't turned up yet!

1060
01:13:41,770 --> 01:13:42,170
She hasn't come yet?!!

1061
01:13:45,370 --> 01:13:45,849
What did you do?

1062
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:50,450
What did you do with
my daughter?

1063
01:13:54,850 --> 01:13:56,450
She is working in the Egmore
child Trust Hospital -

1064
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:58,250
She is 23 years old

1065
01:14:04,250 --> 01:14:04,810
Straw brown!

1066
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:10,849
She'll be having hospital ID card
just look into it and tell

1067
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:13,050
Isn't there anything?

1068

Inform me,if you get
any information

1069
01:14:34,050 --> 01:14:34,849
Are you going out of station?

1070
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:37,450
Won't you come back again?

1071
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:39,250
Where are you going?

1072
01:14:44,290 --> 01:14:48,849
Excuse me,he is packing his bags and
telling that he's really moving out!

1073
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:52,050
Why is he taking the pains,you fold
clothes,pack his bag and give it to him!

1074
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:53,130
What are you talking?

1075
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:54,450
Is he threatening?

1076
01:14:55,410 --> 01:14:57,330
He's 4 donkeys aged! And wants to
go out of the house!

1077
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:11,210
Why are you crying? -

1078
01:15:11,890 --> 01:15:14,850
After ruining your sister's marriage
why are you sheding the tears for?

1079
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:16,170
One who was duped!

1080
01:15:16,330 --> 01:15:17,690
Mother,I don't want
such a marriage

1081
01:15:17,849 --> 01:15:19,450
You don't want it
but look at her -

1082
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:22,850
What she needed,when she needed it
she has ran away and married -

1083
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:23,850
Shameless

1084
01:15:26,450 --> 01:15:31,210
Take it from me,in 6 months you'll
be standing pregnant on the road

1085
01:15:40,361 --> 01:15:41,521
Karthik stop

1086
01:15:42,650 --> 01:15:46,650
Ay,whoever wishes to stop him
they may also go along with him

1087
01:15:47,410 --> 01:15:49,450
What's this? What
are you saying?

1088
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:51,970
That includes you also,if you want to go
with him you may go!

1089
01:15:56,849 --> 01:15:59,530
There isn't any more relationship left
between you and this house,Get out!!

1090
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:09,530
I'll go

1091
01:16:10,850 --> 01:16:12,170
Don't cry my child,why
are you crying?

1092
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:13,849
Where ever you may be
you'll always be happy!

1093
01:16:15,570 --> 01:16:16,010
Don't cry

1094
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:19,490
Ay,I'll go

1095
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:34,849
If they don't require us,even we don't
require them,alright

1096
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:35,650
Alright

1097
01:16:35,849 --> 01:16:36,450

Promise me! There'll no more any
relationship with our family!

1099
01:16:39,850 --> 01:16:40,650
I promise

1100
01:16:41,050 --> 01:16:43,290
From now,you are for me
and I am for you,that's all

1101
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:45,610
Is it okay?

1102
01:16:46,450 --> 01:16:47,450
We'll adjust

1103
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:49,570
Alright,take me
to the temple

1104
01:16:49,890 --> 01:16:50,890
Temple? Why?

1105
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,570
Here,have the keys -

1106
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:10,849
The house is half finished
I don't want the rent

1107
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:11,930
Have you both
got married?

1108
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:15,701
You can marry twice again
No problem

1109
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:17,170
What's all this? Leave them!

1110
01:17:17,370 --> 01:17:18,530
Registered Marriage or
Performed in a temple?

1111
01:17:19,770 --> 01:17:21,530
Poor boy!
Poor girl!

1112
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:22,850

-You don't pull me!

1113
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:27,170

01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:35,290
Don't stay here anymore

1118
01:17:47,665 --> 01:17:52,265
It's a game of love,Beloved...

01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:22,130
Wave,oh! Small wave that touches
the bank and withdraws!

1123
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:27,650
I thought you'll touch me,occupy me slowly
but you're foaming and melting wave

1124
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:36,650
You say "Yes" when I am far away but
when I near you,you ask me,what?

1125
01:18:46,849 --> 01:18:52,050
When you spread over me,win over
me like a maiden!

1126
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:57,250
My dear! Kill me by becoming
a child in the bed room

01:18:58,330 --> 01:19:03,050
It's a game of love...beloved

While singing lullaby you
become like my child!

1133
01:19:31,849 --> 01:19:36,849
When I touch you by myself,you'll
become like a thorn!

1134
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:42,250
When you touch me by yourself
you're becoming like a flower!

1135
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:47,610
Oh! My beloved,you're my eyes,my tears
you're everything to me!

1136
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:52,330
My beloved,you're my joys and sorrows

1137
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:57,850
My life and death is in the
movement of your eyes!

1138
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:13,690
When you spread over me,you
win over me like a maiden!

1139
01:20:14,730 --> 01:20:19,050
My dear,kill me by becoming a
child in the bed room

1140
01:20:20,170 --> 01:20:24,849
It's a game of love...beloved

1143
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:41,250
It's a game of love...beloved

1144
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:47,810
My life is insufficient to
study and know your heart!

1145
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:52,930
To express my love your life
will be insufficient!

1146
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:58,450
You're heart will never be able to
know the value of my love!

1147
01:20:59,010 --> 01:21:03,850
But still my kiss will not
fail to express it!

1148
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:09,170
You're the only one,I have to
celebrate life or kill me!

1149
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:14,170
If you're with me or leave me
I am the only one you have!

1150
01:21:14,450 --> 01:21:19,810
My life surrounds around you!

1151
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:35,490
When you spread over me,you
win over me as a maiden!

1152
01:21:36,530 --> 02:42:17,379
My dear,kill me by becoming
a child in the bed room!

1153
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:46,849
It's a game of love...beloved
Come touch me...touch me...

1154
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:52,050
It's a game of love...beloved

01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:03,050
It's a game of love...beloved

1157
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:30,849
Where's the newspaper?
Not yet come?

1158
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:34,530
As soon as you open your eyes,you should
only see me,so after taking bath wearing a saree -

1159
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:36,650
Putting on a dot,I am sitting
next to you for the last 15 minutes

1160
01:22:37,410 --> 01:22:39,050
Without even looking at me,are you
asking about the newspaper?

1161
01:22:43,849 --> 01:22:47,850
I have seen,you are very beautiful
where is the news paper?

1162
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:50,770
Last night,you said
so many things

1163
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:51,849
Did I say?

1164
01:22:52,849 --> 01:22:54,930
Now,what's happening in Yugoslavia is
more important than the wife,isn't it?

1165
01:22:55,810 --> 01:22:59,290
No,wife is more important
where's the news paper?

1166
01:22:59,849 --> 01:23:00,970
It's not there,both
are not there -

1167
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:02,650
You want the wife
or Yugoslovia?

1168
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:10,849
Ay,should I abandon the World
after marrying you?

1169
01:23:16,490 --> 01:23:17,849
Take hot and
sensational news

1170
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:19,850
Yuck,behaving
like a kid

1171
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:23,290
What's this fire in the house?
This is not right!

1172
01:23:23,530 --> 01:23:25,050
Come,brother
What to do?

1173
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:27,490
You leave today itself,give
me the key,give me

1174
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:29,849
Brother,what's this the other day,you
said it like your own house...

1175
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:30,970
Who...Who said?

1176
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:33,330
You didn't pay the rent,
you didn't deposit the Society fund?

1177
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:35,970
Even you haven't constructed the
ceiling,raised the wall,plastered the cement

1178
01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:38,650
Only for that,I am asking you
are you threatening me?

1179
01:23:38,849 --> 01:23:39,930
I am going to call
the Police

1180
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:43,330
You have to pay me 5 months
rent as advance

1181
01:23:43,570 --> 01:23:45,250
That's not on this month's 1st
its on the next 1st

1182
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:48,610
Oh God! I have dealt with many people
like you,don't play a game with me!

1183
01:23:48,810 --> 01:23:51,450
Brother,Brother only now we have
started this Computer Software...

1184
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:53,730
Whether you start a Software or
Underwear,that's not my problem

1185
01:23:53,849 --> 01:23:56,450
I need my rent that's it!
Arrange for it!

1186
01:23:57,890 --> 01:24:03,570
Don't have these love scenes on
the staircase,have it on bed

1187
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:09,770
Ay,Bhaskar,in which directory
is that syntom file?

1188
01:24:10,970 --> 01:24:12,170
Are you following
it or not?

1189
01:24:12,410 --> 01:24:14,530
We are doing it,only they
haven't telephoned us yet

1190
01:24:18,849 --> 01:24:22,050
Mr.Naidu,give us the project
Shave the head at Tirupathi

1191
01:24:22,849 --> 01:24:23,450
Bhaskar's..

1192
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:29,849
Ay! Its a wrong number!

1193
01:24:31,930 --> 01:24:33,849
All because of him
he'll shave the head

1194
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,170
Sorry,I had gone for fetching
vegetables,got late

1195
01:24:43,690 --> 01:24:45,250
I am waiting for the
last 45 minutes

1196
01:24:46,849 --> 01:24:47,250
Come!

1197
01:24:49,849 --> 01:24:51,450
If you knew,that you'll get late
you should have kept the keys up

1198
01:24:51,849 --> 01:24:53,610
I got a little late,for that
so much of anger?

1199
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:55,410
You'll go somewhere and
come late as you wish -

1200
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:56,849
I should be
waiting outside

1201
01:24:56,930 --> 01:24:58,650
What am I going out
on a pleasure trip? -

1202
01:24:58,849 --> 01:24:59,849
I had gone for fetching things to
cook food for you,isn't it?

1203
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:03,370
Who said that don't go,why are you
making me wait like a watchman?

1204
01:25:04,290 --> 01:25:05,850
Didn't you wait for 3 hours on
the beach,before the marriage -

1205
01:25:06,650 --> 01:25:07,570
Now,can't you wait
for 10 minutes

1206
01:25:07,849 --> 01:25:08,370
That's different

1207
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:09,770
What do you mean
"Different"?

1208
01:25:10,250 --> 01:25:11,250
That was before the marriage

1209
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:14,170
Then after the marriage
that's all,isn't it?

1210
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:16,849
Now,who said like this
open the door

1211
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:17,849
Now you said
isn't it?

1212
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:18,770
Shakthi,open the door

1213
01:25:19,450 --> 01:25:20,490
Don't change your words
-Open the door!

1214
01:25:20,690 --> 01:25:21,330
Then,why did you say?

1215
01:25:21,530 --> 01:25:22,170
Why did you say
like that?

1216
01:25:22,370 --> 01:25:22,970
Did you say or not?

1217
01:25:23,170 --> 01:25:24,890
Don't ask standing outside
you come in,I'll tell you,Go in...

1218
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:25,490
Tell me?

1219
01:25:25,690 --> 01:25:25,970
Get in,I'll tell

1220
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:26,650
Tell me? Why you tell like that?

1221
01:25:26,849 --> 01:25:27,370
Get in,Get in,Go...

1222
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:30,650
Give me

1223
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:34,370
Ay,do you know,how long was
I waiting for this

1224
01:25:34,849 --> 01:25:36,250
Leave me
-I'll not

1225
01:25:36,450 --> 01:25:38,450
Leave,Leave,Leave,not now

1226
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:39,450
Why?

1227
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:40,330
In the afternoon you want...

1228
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:42,650
So,what if its
afternoon

1229
01:25:42,850 --> 01:25:45,849
Ay leave me,after fighting with me
now you are even hugging me

1230
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:48,490
I fought with you
only for this

1231
01:25:48,849 --> 01:25:49,730
Its all for you

1232
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:52,250
Leave me,I haven't even taken my
bath after coming from the hospital!

1233
01:25:53,849 --> 01:25:54,250
Move

1234
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:54,849
I'll not

1235
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:55,370
Move

1236
01:25:55,570 --> 01:25:55,850
Hug me

1237
01:25:56,050 --> 01:25:56,650
Move...

1238
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:01,690
What's this?

1239
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:03,610
I am marking the day
which we fought

1240
01:26:04,050 --> 01:26:04,650
For what?

1241
01:26:04,849 --> 01:26:06,210
To show how big a problem
is marriage

1242
01:26:07,850 --> 01:26:08,450
Oh! Cruel!

1243
01:26:15,810 --> 01:26:16,250
What are you searching?

1244
01:26:18,210 --> 01:26:19,849
You haven't even given a cup of coffee
to your husband

1245
01:26:30,050 --> 01:26:30,610
What are you searching?

1246
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:31,849
The Auspicious thread!!

1247
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:34,849
You sinner! Are you
a Traditional Tamil girl

1248
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,490
Don't laugh,last night you had removed
it because it was hurting you

1249
01:26:37,810 --> 01:26:40,450
Me...? Are you blaming me
after losing it

1250
01:26:41,849 --> 01:26:45,530
The time is not good,if anything happens
to me,my wife will be responsible for it

1251
01:26:45,730 --> 01:26:46,250
Don't scare me

1252
01:26:46,970 --> 01:26:47,650
Where has it gone?

1253
01:26:48,849 --> 01:26:50,330
I am sitting like a Statue of God
infront of you -

1254
01:26:50,849 --> 01:26:52,050
Leaving me,you are searching for the
Auspicious thread

1255
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:54,250
I only want the Auspicious thread
I don't want you,Go

1256
01:26:54,849 --> 01:26:57,170
Allright,search the auspicious thread
and marry that itself

1257
01:26:57,610 --> 01:26:58,090
Is there any one?

1258
01:26:58,650 --> 01:26:59,010
Who is it?

1259
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:03,450
Are you too busy?

1260
01:27:03,650 --> 01:27:04,090
No,No

1261
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:04,849
Was it Good?

1262
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:06,810
Wasn't it good?

1263
01:27:06,890 --> 01:27:07,410
What?

1264
01:27:07,849 --> 01:27:11,050
Oh God,Last night didn't I send
you hot fish curry for your dinner?

1265
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:13,210
After eating you didn't even
say a word about it

1266
01:27:13,410 --> 01:27:15,650
Oh! I am sorry,it was very good
we ate the entire

1267
01:27:15,849 --> 01:27:18,970
Should I ask for it? Allright
can I have the vessels?

1268
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:19,849
This one,isn't it?

1269
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:20,770
Yes,this one

1270
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:25,250
Oh God,if I give someone Rs.1 Lakh
and that person cheats me,I can bear -

1271
01:27:25,450 --> 01:27:26,970
But,I can't bear if the
lid gets exchanged

1272
01:27:27,170 --> 01:27:27,650
Should I leave?

1273
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:31,849
What have you done?
-What?

1274
01:27:32,050 --> 01:27:32,650
This

1275
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:35,650
What's that hanging like a garland?

1276
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:39,250
This is an Auspicious thread
isn't it?

1277
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:40,849
This is a real marriage
isn't it?

1278
01:27:42,570 --> 01:27:43,849
Oh God! Please
save them

1279
01:27:46,690 --> 01:27:47,930
Karthik,is it
your work?

1280
01:27:49,250 --> 01:27:50,130
He's putting my honour in stake!

1281
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:52,849
Ay,where are you,why are
you taking my life?

1282
01:27:58,850 --> 01:27:59,770
Your friend has come

1283
01:28:00,050 --> 01:28:01,730
Just watch,in another 1 minute
a fight will flare up

1284
01:28:01,850 --> 01:28:02,650
Don't tell it
just like that!

1285
01:28:03,170 --> 01:28:03,730
You just watch

1286
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:04,850
You shouldn't start the fight!

1287
01:28:05,090 --> 01:28:05,849
I'll be quiet

1288
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:11,849
What happened about
Hyderabad?

1289
01:28:13,849 --> 01:28:14,849
Hai wife,what are
you doing?

1290
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:15,770
Hai husband

1291
01:28:15,849 --> 01:28:16,570
Tea? Move out,I'll make!

1292
01:28:17,130 --> 01:28:17,930
I have made it,you go

1293
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:20,849
Are you telling it because
Meera is there

1294
01:28:24,849 --> 01:28:25,450
30 seconds

1295
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,610
He is sweet

1296
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:42,130
Shakthi,where is my
project report?

1297
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:42,890
Why are you
asking me?

1298
01:28:46,170 --> 01:28:46,930
I had kept it
here only

1299
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,850
Coming,Coming,Coming...
Don't shout

1300
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:51,010
Don't lose my papers

1301
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:53,170
Shakthi,tomorrow I have
a presentation -

1302
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:54,090
These papers....

1303
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,450
Shakthi,that report....

1304
01:29:44,850 --> 01:29:46,250
The care you're showing,when
you saw me!

1305
01:29:47,050 --> 01:29:48,850
If you have even a little,when you
do not see me,would be much better!

1306
01:29:49,849 --> 01:29:51,850
You didn't even see whether
we are alive or....

1307
01:29:53,650 --> 01:29:56,850
I do have care for you in plenty
only you're not recognizing it!

1308
01:29:57,850 --> 01:29:59,849
Not a day passes without your
thoughts and its distress!

1309
01:30:00,650 --> 01:30:01,850
Have you ever felt distressed
with my thoughts?

1310
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:03,849
You would have only cursed me
isn't it,sister?

1311
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:04,849
How are you?

1312
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:06,850
How many time I would have
called Nadar's stores!

1313
01:30:07,250 --> 01:30:08,250
Did you come even once
on the line?

1314
01:30:08,850 --> 01:30:09,849
You too have left me,isn't it?

1315
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:11,849
Mother,how's father?

1316
01:30:13,849 --> 01:30:15,050
He has been Hospitalised!

1317
01:30:17,650 --> 01:30:19,050
Mother! Why? What happened?

1318
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:22,850
What do I know? Did I study Medicine?

1319
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:25,849
That's...what did they say?

1320
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:34,850
Did they say it as Jaundice?
Have they diagonised it Immediately?

1321
01:30:36,050 --> 01:30:37,849
Mother,why has he been admitted
into a Hospital?

1322
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:39,250
I want to see father immediately!

1323
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:42,849
Don't tell him that,I had met
you and talked with you!

1324
01:30:44,250 --> 01:30:45,650
He'll get better,if
he sees you!

1325
01:30:48,090 --> 01:30:51,690
I have come here to beg you,to
come & see your father!

1326
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:14,450
Hey! Didn't you go to work?

1327
01:31:17,450 --> 01:31:18,250
It seems father isn't keeping
good health!

1328
01:31:23,050 --> 01:31:24,050
We'll go and...

1329
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,450
...We don't have parents!!!

1330
01:31:27,850 --> 01:31:29,450
You have only"me" and I have only"you"
that's what you had said!

1331
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,650
He has been admitted into
the Railway Hospital!

1332
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:37,650
Shakthi! Who told you that?

1333
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:40,050
Why do you want that?....

1334
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:40,850
Who told you?

1335
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:46,250
Mother told me!

1336
01:31:47,850 --> 01:31:48,650
I met her in the Train!

1337
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:52,050
Without coming to Home!

1338
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,450
Without my knowledge
only for you!

1339
01:31:55,650 --> 01:31:57,250
Karthik,please listen to
what I say?

1340
01:31:58,050 --> 01:31:59,450
He's just an ordinary
Railway  Employee!

1341
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:02,050
He struggled and took loans to
make me study Medicine!

1342
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:04,850
Now,he's not well!....

1343
01:32:05,450 --> 01:32:07,050
If I don't go there now,what's
use of me studying Medicine?

1344
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:11,450
Okay! You go and see him!...

1345
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:13,050
....But,I'll not come!!

1346
01:32:19,450 --> 01:32:20,650
Karthik,Can't you do atleast
this for me?

1347
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:25,050
Shakthi! Do you want me to come there
throwing away my honour,prestige!

1348
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:28,050
He has slapped me!

1349
01:32:28,849 --> 01:32:29,650
....I can never forget it!

1350
01:32:29,850 --> 01:32:31,250
Even my own father has
never beaten me!

1351
01:32:33,250 --> 01:32:35,250
It's better to die than to come
face to face with him!

1352
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:40,450
In this world I don't have even
10 people who I may need!!

1353
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:43,450
If I want you,I have to
forsake them!

1354
01:32:44,050 --> 01:32:45,650
If I want them,then,I have to
forsake you! How is it possible?

1355
01:32:46,849 --> 01:32:47,850
Shakthi,do whatever you feel
like doing?

1356
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:50,050
If You want them,
go their home,Go

1357
01:32:50,650 --> 01:32:51,650
If you want to come back
or may be not!

1358
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:52,849
Do whatever you want to do?

1359
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:54,450
But,Please leave
me alone!

1360
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:15,850
Just one marriage means
so many troubles!

1361
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:18,650
I don't know how people
marry 2 or 3 times?

1362
01:33:18,850 --> 01:33:19,849
Our Rohit will marry....

1363
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:22,050
...2 or 3...

1364
01:33:27,250 --> 01:33:28,250
How is your father?

1365
01:33:29,849 --> 01:33:30,450
How do I know?

1366
01:33:32,450 --> 01:33:33,849
I had told you to go
and see your father!

1367
01:33:35,050 --> 01:33:36,850
You had even told about
killing yourself!

1368
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:38,850
Okay!....

1369
01:33:40,650 --> 01:33:41,650
Tomorrow,we both will go!

1370
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:43,850
No Karthik!

1371
01:33:44,850 --> 01:33:46,450
We'll not go to the House
who don't respect you!

1372
01:33:47,650 --> 01:33:48,250
Leave that aside!

1373
01:33:49,450 --> 01:33:50,250
Tomorrow morning we'll go!

1374
01:33:52,650 --> 01:33:54,849
You go inside and see him!
I'll stand outside!

1375
01:33:55,050 --> 01:33:55,850
Please,you also come inside!

1376
01:33:56,450 --> 01:33:57,849
Let him see that we are
happy together!

1377
01:33:58,050 --> 01:33:59,050
Are we really happy?!

1378
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:00,050
You're going to get
beating for this!

1379
01:34:01,250 --> 01:34:03,650
Karthik,if he talks anything
out of anger-

1380
01:34:03,849 --> 01:34:04,849
You'll not take it
seriously! isn't it?

1381
01:34:05,050 --> 01:34:06,450
Even if he slaps me again
I'll bear it!

1382
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:49,650
Shouldn't you have come
a day before?

1383
01:35:05,850 --> 01:35:07,450
I have lost my brother....

1384
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:22,450
Hey! You have become the cause
of death of your father!

1385
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,850
Father! Look,I am Shakthi!
who has come

1386
01:35:25,050 --> 01:35:27,849
If you had come early you would
have met your father!

1387
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:29,650
Father,Shakthi has again
come back to our House

1388
01:35:31,050 --> 01:35:33,250
Father,please,open your eyes!!
and see for once

1389
01:35:51,849 --> 01:35:52,850
Mother,why did you give
birth to me?

1390
01:35:55,849 --> 01:35:57,050
Mother,why did you bring me up
like an obstinate girl?

1391
01:35:59,050 --> 01:36:00,450
The day when I spoke
illmannerly!

1392
01:36:00,650 --> 01:36:01,650
If you had broken my limbs and
threw me in a corner!

1393
01:36:01,849 --> 01:36:02,650
Would this had happened?

1394
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:07,450
Mother,why did you allow me to
go out of the House?

1395
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:09,849
Is your mistake!....

1396
01:36:12,450 --> 01:36:13,450
Dream of making me a Doctor....

1397
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:16,650
...He never had any other wish!

1398
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:21,450
Mother,when he wasn't well
where was I?

1399
01:36:23,450 --> 01:36:24,650
Why do you need marriage
and family?...

1400
01:36:24,849 --> 01:36:25,849
...Saying this why didn't you beat me
and brought me back to Home?

1401
01:36:25,850 --> 01:36:27,050
Why did you
leave me?

1402
01:36:28,450 --> 01:36:29,650
Was he so angry on me?

1403
01:36:30,650 --> 01:36:32,450
He left without even seeing me!

1404
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:37,250
I have done a mistake....
....I have done a great mistake!

1405
01:36:38,850 --> 01:36:40,650
Mother,tell me to say that
he has forgiven me!

1406
01:36:41,849 --> 01:36:43,850
Mother,atleast you tell that
you have forgiven me!

1407
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:46,450
Mother...atleast you...

1408
01:36:46,650 --> 01:36:47,250
No need for all that!

1409
01:36:48,850 --> 01:36:50,050
Whatever you may say....

1410
01:36:51,850 --> 01:36:55,050
Even for 1 minute can you make your
father come alive before me?

1411
01:36:57,450 --> 01:36:58,050
It is not possible....isn't it?...

1412
01:37:00,650 --> 01:37:01,650
...Then don't talk!

1413
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:03,849
Get out!!

1414
01:37:10,250 --> 01:37:14,250
They won't inform and go from a
House of death!...Go!

1415
01:37:20,850 --> 01:37:22,849
Because of our marriage,Poorani's
marriage was broken!

1416
01:37:24,849 --> 01:37:27,450
Both homes broke up,and one even
went up to the cremation grand!

1417
01:37:30,450 --> 01:37:32,050
How am I going to face Shakthi?

1418
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,850
Till his last,he left with anger

1419
01:37:38,250 --> 01:37:40,450
He died with a sorrow forgetting
a daughter like me!

1420
01:37:45,650 --> 01:37:47,650
She pestered....but I didn't
take her there!

1421
01:37:50,050 --> 01:37:51,650
I could have taken her there and
spoken with him!

1422
01:37:53,849 --> 01:37:54,850
I was obstinate!

1423
01:37:57,450 --> 01:37:58,250
Okay! Leave it!

1424
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:02,450
Why do you want to unnecessarily take it
upon yourself and get distressed?

1425
01:38:02,850 --> 01:38:04,050
My father used to say always...

1426
01:38:05,650 --> 01:38:07,250
That he'll go only after
marrying me to a good boy

1427
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,050
Shakthi! Elders will never
go away from us!

1428
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:12,849
They'll always be with us!

1429
01:38:14,450 --> 01:38:15,850
He would have come to know that
Karthik is a good boy!

1430
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:19,050
That's why,he has left us
and went away!

1431
01:38:20,450 --> 01:38:21,250
Take this coffee...

1432
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:22,450
...Please have this coffee,my child!

1433
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:37,650
How many more days,are you going
to cry within yourself?

1434
01:38:37,849 --> 01:38:38,650
Then,what do you want me
to do?!

1435
01:38:39,250 --> 01:38:40,450
Anger can't be dissolved
with tears!

1436
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:42,850
I am not angry on anyone!

1437
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:46,050
I am angry on myself
for being selfish

1438
01:38:47,850 --> 01:38:50,050
I had decided considering
only my choice!!

1439
01:38:51,450 --> 01:38:52,450
That's why,God has
done all this!

1440
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:54,850
Why are you beating
around the bush?

1441
01:38:55,650 --> 01:38:56,650
...Why don't you say it
straight on my face?

1442
01:38:58,050 --> 01:38:59,050
That you have killed
my father!!

1443
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:00,850
Not you....it's me!!!

1444
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:01,650
Look....

1445
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:04,050
...The man who's gone,isn't
going to come back!

1446
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:07,650
Whenever you cry!

1447
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:09,250
As if you're saying
it's all because of you!!

1448
01:39:10,650 --> 01:39:11,650
Tell me,if you don't want
to see me!

1449
01:39:12,450 --> 01:39:13,450
Even I'll also get lost!

1450
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:14,250
Alright! You also go away!

1451
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:18,450
After that without anyone for me
I'll distress alone and die!

1452
01:39:20,050 --> 01:39:21,850
What'll be my fate?
what's written in fate?...

1453
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:22,850
Stop!! Enough!!

1454
01:39:26,050 --> 01:39:27,850
Don't talk with me for my
entire life! It's enough!...

1455
01:39:41,050 --> 01:39:41,849
...What I mean to say....

1456
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:43,824
No need,don't say
anything!

1457
01:39:43,849 --> 01:39:46,050
It's alright! When I can live
without my father!

1458
01:39:47,550 --> 01:39:48,550
I can live without you also!

1459
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:49,973
Don't worry!

1460
01:40:01,750 --> 01:40:02,350
Where are you going?

1461
01:40:02,950 --> 01:40:07,549
Leave me! Don't utter even a word!
It's enough!

1462
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:31,950
Hello! Is it Hyundai Factory?

1463
01:40:33,150 --> 01:40:35,150
Can I speak to works manager
Mr.Raghuraman?

1464
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:38,350
What should I say?

1465
01:40:38,549 --> 01:40:40,350
It's enough,if you say only
what is written on this?!

1466
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:41,950
I wouldn't be in any soup,isn't it?

1467
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:43,950
Talk softly like a girl!
that's enough!

1468
01:40:45,150 --> 01:40:46,350
Hello I am....

1469
01:40:46,950 --> 01:40:47,750
....I am unable to talk!

1470
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:49,150
I'll hit you! Look here and talk!

1471
01:40:49,950 --> 01:40:50,550
My name is Poorni!

1472
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:51,350
Soft soft soft....

1473
01:40:52,549 --> 01:40:54,950
My name is Poorni,I am calling
from Tambaram Nirmala College!

1474
01:40:55,150 --> 01:40:56,150
Do you remember me?

1475
01:40:58,350 --> 01:40:58,950
How are you?

1476
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:02,550
I went....I went to
meet you! for a while

1477
01:41:03,350 --> 01:41:04,750
Me?!?....why?

1478
01:41:06,549 --> 01:41:08,549
Don't worry! I'll not kidnap you!

1479
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:14,550
I am Raghuraman from Hyundai
factory speaking!

1480
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:16,950
What do you want?

1481
01:41:18,150 --> 01:41:19,550
I want to meet you personally
for a small talk!

1482
01:41:20,350 --> 01:41:21,750
Your family had insulted us
isn't that enough?

1483
01:41:21,950 --> 01:41:22,950
Please,only for 5 minutes!

1484
01:41:23,549 --> 01:41:27,750
When you're going home,I'll meet you
at Besant Nagar Bus Stop by 4 PM

1485
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,900
I'll meet you by 4 PM only
for 5 minutes,please!!

1486
01:41:51,350 --> 01:41:52,549
It seems he is that
Hyundai Guy!

1487
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:54,606
Only God should save!

1488
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:58,350
My family was destroyed
dispersed and perished!

1489
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:00,927
Are you happy?

1490
01:42:02,350 --> 01:42:05,950
The day you came and went away
they had started crying...

1491
01:42:06,214 --> 01:42:08,320
It hasn't yet stopped!
Is it enough?

1492
01:42:08,724 --> 01:42:09,524
Whatever happened,has happened?

1493
01:42:09,794 --> 01:42:11,795
If you think that all was wrong because
of our wrong doings...

1494
01:42:12,350 --> 01:42:13,350
I don't think this
will come good...

1495
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:15,950
Calling personally one who
is depressed to feel happy!

1496
01:42:16,150 --> 01:42:17,150
What do I do without getting
angry on such people?

1497
01:42:17,350 --> 01:42:18,550
Excuse me! You only called me!

1498
01:42:18,950 --> 01:42:19,350
Me!?!

1499
01:42:19,550 --> 01:42:21,150
You only called me!
Am I mad?

1500
01:42:21,549 --> 01:42:23,550
No! You only called my factory
to meet personally...

1501
01:42:23,750 --> 01:42:25,350
Not me! You only called
my bank!

1502
01:42:25,549 --> 01:42:25,950
Wasn't it you who had talked?

1503
01:42:26,150 --> 01:42:28,350
Told me to come at 4 p.m to
disrespect me personally!

1504
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:29,750
Who's that,who had called
me by 4.30 p.m?

1505
01:42:34,549 --> 01:42:35,549
I am quitting from this game!

1506
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:47,549
Is it your handy work?

1507
01:45:49,950 --> 03:28:41,054
What do you think
of yourself?

1508
01:42:54,150 --> 01:42:54,950
Are you bringing a
couple together?

1509
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:56,750
Otherwise are you working
as a Marriage broker?

1510
01:42:57,550 --> 01:42:58,549
I feel like using choicest abuses...

1511
01:43:00,950 --> 01:43:02,150
The marriage which was stopped
because of me!

1512
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,150
A small wish that it
may happen that's all!

1513
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:08,150
You have done so much
for Shakthi!

1514
01:43:08,950 --> 01:43:10,150
For that,I wanted to repay by
doing a good thing but...

1515
01:43:13,549 --> 01:43:14,550
Please forgive me!

1516
01:43:23,150 --> 01:43:23,750
What? Is it a flop?

1517
01:43:24,950 --> 01:43:26,150
Is it a bigger flop than
our company?

1518
01:43:27,549 --> 01:43:27,950
Come!

1519
01:43:30,750 --> 01:43:32,750
Its more than 10 days since we
talked with each other!

1520
01:43:33,550 --> 01:43:34,550
Marriage means,it'll be
like that only!

1521
01:43:35,549 --> 01:43:37,550
Do you know that,not a single day passes
without me and Rajesh fighting?

1522
01:43:39,150 --> 01:43:39,950
We were never like that!

1523
01:43:42,550 --> 01:43:44,350
May be Karthik doesn't
like me anymore!

1524
01:43:47,350 --> 01:43:50,150
Leaving you,he isn't roaming with
other girls! Why bother?

1525
01:43:50,550 --> 01:43:52,350
Look,everything will be alright!

1526
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:55,550
I was considering you both as
perfect in all our group!

1527
01:43:55,950 --> 01:43:57,750
Why are you bothering yourself?
...Come...!

1528
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:14,150
One ice-cream for both of you!

1529
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:15,549
What did you say?...

1530
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:16,549
What did she say that day...

1531
01:44:17,150 --> 01:44:18,550
...Am I a marriage broker to
bring a couple together?

1532
01:44:19,950 --> 01:44:20,950
She wanted to mouth
choicest abuses?..

1533
01:44:21,550 --> 01:44:23,150
Now,it doesn't seem to
look like that!

1534
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:25,150
Are you both convinced?

1535
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:27,549
Why are you staring?
Come on tell!...

1536
01:44:31,350 --> 01:44:33,350
Hey! When is the marriage?...
When is the marriage?

1537
01:44:34,350 --> 01:44:35,750
He has told that he'll come and
talk in another 2 days!

1538
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:35,549
I want to tell you one thing...

1539
01:45:37,550 --> 01:45:38,549
Okay,I'll tell you later!

1540
01:45:39,950 --> 01:45:41,950
In my office Rohit's marriage
has been settled!

1541
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:44,549
With both families consent!

1542
01:45:46,350 --> 01:45:46,950
...Not like us!

1543
01:45:48,549 --> 01:45:50,150
Tomorrow,all my friends
are going out together!

1544
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:08,000
We two are going...
Did you hear?

1545
01:45:54,550 --> 01:45:55,750
There may be 100 problems
between us!

1546
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,550
But no one outside should
know about it!

1547
01:45:58,750 --> 01:46:02,150
They are thinking that we
both are an ideal couple!

1548
01:46:04,549 --> 01:46:05,150
Come atleast for me!

1549
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:19,150
How did you manage
to bring her?

1550
01:46:19,549 --> 01:46:20,150
Everything is like that only!

1551
01:46:21,750 --> 01:46:22,350
Now it'll be like that only!

1552
01:46:22,549 --> 01:46:24,350
But after marriage you're a gonner
Doomed forever!

1553
01:46:25,150 --> 01:46:25,950
Hey! Ashok! Keep quiet!

1554
01:46:26,150 --> 01:46:27,350
You seem to look like a
very good girl!

1555
01:46:27,550 --> 01:46:28,750
How did you deceived like
this with Rohit?

1556
01:46:29,150 --> 01:46:31,550
Just as I got deceived by Shakthi
Another sinner got stucked up!

1557
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:35,350
Hey! What's all this guys? Instead of
Greeting,why are you scaring me?

1558
01:46:35,549 --> 01:46:37,549
Buddy! You're getting really
married! No,don't do it!

1559
01:46:37,550 --> 01:46:38,550
It'll be very difficult!
Isn't it?

1560
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:39,549
Well said!

1561
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:40,549
Hey! You'll get thrashed!

1562
01:46:40,550 --> 01:46:41,950
You are married and happy!

1563
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:43,550
Are you scaring one who's
going to get married?

1564
01:46:43,950 --> 01:46:44,950
Hey Boy! You don't worry!

1565
01:46:45,750 --> 01:46:47,150
After marriage all men will
be like this only!

1566
01:46:47,350 --> 01:46:48,150
Their true colours will be out!

1567
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:48,750
How,How,How....

1568
01:46:48,950 --> 01:46:50,150
First they'll open the car door!

1569
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:52,350
After that,they'll hold
the umbrella!

1570
01:46:53,550 --> 01:46:56,549
After that,with great love...
they'll chase like gentlemen!

1571
01:46:57,550 --> 01:46:58,350
But after marriage...

1572
01:46:58,549 --> 01:46:59,350
After?...

1573
01:46:59,549 --> 01:47:00,550
Everything will fly out of
the windows!

1574
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:05,150
Look at me! I am even
pressing my wife's legs!

1575
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:06,950
It's more than enough if you
don't pull my legs!

1576
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:08,350
Only 25 days are remaining
for the marriage!

1577
01:47:09,950 --> 01:47:10,550
You get married!

1578
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:14,150
The difficulties I am undergoing,let
this whole World also undergo!

1579
01:47:14,750 --> 01:47:16,950
Okay...Okay...Who all want
me to marry?

1580
01:47:17,150 --> 01:47:17,950
Who..Who...

1581
01:47:18,549 --> 01:47:19,950
Now who all don't want
me to marry?

1582
01:47:21,950 --> 01:47:23,549
Marry...but...

1583
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:25,950
Tell...Tell...Tell...

1584
01:47:26,549 --> 01:47:27,750
My sorrow is lost...

1585
01:47:29,549 --> 01:47:30,950
My happiness is lost...

1586
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:38,549
My happiness is lost!

1587
01:47:54,549 --> 01:48:01,350
September month!...September month
Lost the sorrows of the life!

1588
01:48:01,550 --> 01:48:08,350
September month...September month!
Lost the sorrows of the life!

1589
01:48:12,150 --> 01:48:18,750
October month...October month!
Lost the happiness of life!

1590
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:21,950
When you lost your sorrows...

1591
01:48:22,350 --> 01:48:25,549
Love was born at that time....

1592
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:29,150
When you lost the happiness..

1593
01:48:29,350 --> 01:48:32,550
You got married at that time..

1594
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:39,750
September month...September month
Lost the sorrows of the life

1595
01:48:40,150 --> 01:48:46,550
October month...October month
Lost the happiness of life!

1596
01:48:46,950 --> 01:48:50,150
When you lost your sorrows...

1597
01:48:50,350 --> 01:48:53,549
Love was born at that time...

1598
01:48:53,550 --> 01:48:57,150
When you test the happiness...

1599
01:48:57,549 --> 01:49:02,750
You got married at
that time!

1600
01:49:21,950 --> 01:49:30,750
Oh girl! Love is like a feast of sweets!
Marriage is the bitterness of the neem!

1601
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:38,350
Oh! My boy! Love sees only strengths
Marriage sees only weaknesses!

1602
01:49:39,549 --> 01:49:44,549
Oh Girl! Love is seen only by half eye!
Marriage is seen by 4 pairs of eyes!

1603
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:50,950
On the tip of the noses,love enjoys
even the beauty of crows!

1604
01:49:51,550 --> 01:49:58,350
After marriage even mole hills become
mountains! Why this clashes?

1605
01:49:58,750 --> 01:50:05,350
Men without women,man can't
have the consolation!

1606
01:50:05,550 --> 01:50:12,550
If women aren't there in this World
men may never need consolation!

1607
01:50:12,950 --> 01:50:16,150
September month...September month!

1608
01:50:19,950 --> 01:50:23,150
October month...October month!

1609
01:50:54,750 --> 01:50:59,950
I have found out the love means
heavy chains!

1610
01:51:00,150 --> 01:51:03,950
Marriage means Auspicious chain
what can I do?

1611
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:11,350
Postpone the marriage till 90 and
come my love,let's cross 100 also?

1612
01:51:12,350 --> 01:51:16,750
My friend! I don't get the love's irons
and splinters in marriage's cot!

1613
01:51:17,550 --> 01:51:20,950
There's no happiness in relationship in
which there isn't a separation!

1614
01:51:21,150 --> 01:51:23,550
That's what is love!

1615
01:51:24,550 --> 01:51:30,549
Come let's live with sometime with relationship
and sometime with separations!

1616
01:51:31,550 --> 01:51:38,350
Without men,women don't
have the consolation!

1617
01:51:38,550 --> 01:51:44,549
If there aren't any men in this World
there's no need for consolation!

1618
01:51:45,750 --> 01:51:52,550
September month...September month
Lost the sorrows of the life!

1619
01:51:52,950 --> 01:51:59,549
October month...October month
Lost the happiness of life!

1620
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:02,950
When you lost your sorrows!

1621
01:52:03,165 --> 01:52:06,365
Love was born at that time...

1622
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:09,950
When you lost the happiness...

1623
01:52:10,150 --> 01:52:15,549
You got married at that time

1624
01:52:24,549 --> 01:52:25,549
You have lost interest
in me,isn't it?

1625
01:52:26,550 --> 01:52:27,549
Why are you starting it now?

1626
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:29,950
Or else has marriage become bitter?

1627
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:32,350
What I said was just for fun...

1628
01:52:33,150 --> 01:52:34,549
If you don't feel like that in your
heart,will it come out?

1629
01:52:35,350 --> 01:52:37,150
What do you mean by saying that you
have lost happiness after marriage?

1630
01:52:37,550 --> 01:52:38,549
You don't like me....

1631
01:52:38,750 --> 01:52:40,150
It means you like
some one else!

1632
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:42,550
Why are you killing me?

1633
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:44,750
Whatever I do,Is
it wrong?

1634
01:52:45,549 --> 01:52:46,550
Then do you say that you
haven't done anything wrong?

1635
01:52:47,950 --> 01:52:49,350
I am like that only...
I had seen in the street corner!

1636
01:52:49,549 --> 01:52:52,724
Then,why did you marry me?

1637
01:52:53,150 --> 01:52:54,350
You should have married
the girl you like?

1638
01:52:54,549 --> 01:52:54,950
It was a mistake!!...

1639
01:52:56,150 --> 01:52:57,549
I and you shouldn't
have married!

1640
01:52:58,350 --> 01:52:58,950
We should have remained
as friends!

1641
01:53:01,950 --> 01:53:03,150
I am able to understand very well
what you're saying!

1642
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:06,550
Look!...Crying...

1643
01:53:07,550 --> 01:53:09,150
What cruelty have I done to you
for crying like this?

1644
01:53:09,350 --> 01:53:10,150
I have done the cruelty!

1645
01:53:11,150 --> 01:53:13,150
Leaving my parents behind
I came believing you!

1646
01:53:13,549 --> 01:53:14,549
That was the biggest mistake
I had committed!

1647
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:17,950
Why this love marriages?
Is it necessary?

1648
01:53:18,150 --> 01:53:18,750
If you don't want then get away!

1649
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:21,750
Leave me also!

1650
01:53:22,550 --> 01:53:23,549
Even I'll live in peace!

1651
01:53:41,550 --> 01:53:42,950
I am unable to understand
these women!

1652
01:53:44,550 --> 01:53:45,950
This love...this marriage!

1653
01:53:46,150 --> 01:53:48,750
Marriage means...We have to sacrifice
little things for each other!

1654
01:53:50,150 --> 01:53:52,150
We have to keep her before
our self interest!

1655
01:53:53,750 --> 01:53:55,350
Throw away this Ego!

1656
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:57,549
What was the reason that made
you to love Shakthi?

1657
01:53:58,550 --> 01:54:00,950
Meeting her in Beach
hugging in Parks!

1658
01:54:01,549 --> 01:54:04,550
What you see in Cinema
is not at all love!

1659
01:54:05,350 --> 01:54:06,350
Boy! That is not love!

1660
01:54:07,950 --> 01:54:10,549
Its just an infatuation
before marriage!

1661
01:54:11,950 --> 01:54:13,950
Flower...just like a flower!

1662
01:54:14,350 --> 01:54:16,350
It'll be intoxicated,fragrant
and beautiful!

1663
01:54:17,550 --> 01:54:18,350
...But it'll wither away!

1664
01:54:20,750 --> 01:54:22,150
What you get after marriage...

1665
01:54:23,150 --> 01:54:24,350
...Is like Roots!

1666
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:26,550
It'll be inside the soil
rooted firmly!

1667
01:54:32,150 --> 01:54:34,550
Whatever may happen you must
make small sacrifices!

1668
01:54:35,550 --> 01:54:36,150
Sacrifice!

1669
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:40,549
Want a small?!

1670
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:52,549
Oh! God! How much I have
to search for you?

1671
01:54:53,350 --> 01:54:54,549
Are you trying to hide
from me?

1672
01:54:56,750 --> 01:54:57,750
I want to tell you
one thing!

1673
01:54:57,950 --> 01:54:59,150
But I am unable to understand
how to tell you about it?

1674
01:54:59,550 --> 01:55:00,750
At this age,I am
feeling shy...

1675
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:08,150
Hey! Why didn't you tell me
about this earlier itself?

1676
01:55:08,549 --> 01:55:09,549
Did I hide anything from you?

1677
01:55:10,150 --> 01:55:12,150
No! Lest it doesn't end up like
previous one!

1678
01:55:12,350 --> 01:55:13,350
I was just waiting to finalize
everything...

1679
01:55:13,549 --> 01:55:13,750
I'll thrash you!

1680
01:55:13,950 --> 01:55:15,950
That's why I took a promise
from Karthik

1681
01:55:16,350 --> 01:55:17,150
That he should not reveal it you!

1682
01:55:18,550 --> 01:55:20,750
He's the reason behind this
our second innings!

1683
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:28,150
He pursued,hit and crashed against
and brought us together!

1684
01:55:29,950 --> 01:55:31,549
I...Yuck!

1685
01:55:32,549 --> 01:55:33,750
Shakthi,don't cry

1686
01:55:35,350 --> 01:55:36,350
If you cry,I will also feel!

1687
01:55:37,550 --> 01:55:38,550
My elder sister is very precious!

1688
01:55:39,350 --> 01:55:40,570
Will you look after her without
tears in her eyes?

1689
01:55:43,150 --> 01:55:44,750
Don't fight with him!
Be nice!

1690
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:47,550
I want to meet
Karthik immediately!

1691
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:49,549
I'll go!

1692
01:55:54,750 --> 01:55:56,750
Shakthi,tonight I am invited for
a dinner in his house!

1693
01:55:57,549 --> 01:55:58,549
Mother-in-law's house dinner!

1694
01:56:42,950 --> 01:56:45,950
we have got the 2 Million dollar
contract!! Rs.9 crores!!

1695
01:57:49,350 --> 01:57:50,350
What,are you waiting for Shakthi?

1696
01:57:50,950 --> 01:57:52,549
It would have been better if you
would have married me!

1697
01:57:52,550 --> 01:57:54,350
I'll inform Shakthi after that
let's us arrange

1698
01:57:54,549 --> 01:57:55,750
Hey! will you come good in life?

1699
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:13,750
Did she tell you about
her going some where?

1700
01:58:40,950 --> 01:58:41,750
Did you drive it yourself?

1701
01:58:46,350 --> 01:58:48,350
Why did you take it,you know
that you don't have a licence?

1702
01:58:54,549 --> 01:58:55,150
Did you get hurt?

1703
01:58:59,150 --> 01:58:59,750
You didn't get hurt,isn't it?

1704
01:59:03,150 --> 01:59:04,150
Did anyone else get hurt?

1705
01:59:08,550 --> 01:59:09,150
A girl!

1706
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:10,350
Severely hurt?!

1707
01:59:11,750 --> 01:59:12,549
She is alive isn't it?

1708
01:59:13,350 --> 01:59:14,549
Have they taken her to
any hospital?

1709
01:59:15,950 --> 01:59:16,549
I don't know

1710
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:17,550
What did you do?

1711
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:19,549
I got scared!!

1712
01:59:25,150 --> 01:59:25,950
Do you know where she is?

1713
01:59:28,950 --> 01:59:29,950
Where did the accident

02:09:29,110 --> 02:09:31,549
He only hit her and got her
admitted into the Hospital also

1885
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:34,830
He signed as husband and arranged
for the operations!

1886
02:09:46,549 --> 02:09:47,779
How is she?

1887
02:09:52,430 --> 02:09:54,310
Doctors have told to
pray to God!

1888
02:09:57,670 --> 02:09:59,549
You pray to God!..

1889
02:10:01,470 --> 02:10:05,110
If anything happens to her,only
God can save you!

1890
02:10:08,110 --> 02:10:09,470
How much ever a high officer
you may be?

1891
02:10:10,310 --> 02:10:11,550
Even If you know higher
officials in police?...

1892
02:10:27,870 --> 02:10:28,750
How did you hit her?

1893
02:10:31,270 --> 02:10:32,110
Were you driving drunk?

1894
02:10:34,870 --> 02:10:35,750
Why didn't you report it
to police?

1895
02:10:35,950 --> 02:10:37,549
My husband has done
nothing wrong!

1896
02:10:48,549 --> 02:10:52,350
If anything happens to Shakthi,you're
husband will not be alive!

1897
02:10:54,070 --> 02:10:55,350
Nothing will happen
to your wife!

1898
02:10:59,350 --> 02:11:01,150
I'll die before that!!

1899
02:11:06,430 --> 02:11:07,350
I am the murderer...

1900
02:11:07,870 --> 02:11:08,470
No...Meena...

1901
02:11:08,630 --> 02:11:11,270
I took out the Car and...
...that young lady...

1902
02:11:13,150 --> 02:11:13,670
....I hit her!!

1903
02:11:20,190 --> 02:11:21,470
This sin will not leave
me that simply!

1904
02:11:26,990 --> 02:11:27,950
What have I done?

1905
02:11:29,750 --> 02:11:30,630
Nothing will happen to her?

1906
02:11:31,550 --> 02:11:32,750
Everything happened because of me!

1907
02:11:33,550 --> 02:11:34,270
She'll survive!

1908
02:11:37,350 --> 02:11:40,350
If she survives,it'll be
for your goodness!

1909
02:12:02,549 --> 02:12:09,150
She is your life!your wife will
not go leaving you alone!

1910
02:12:49,854 --> 02:12:51,373
Why are you not walking up?
are you scared of fighting again?

1911
02:12:56,883 --> 02:12:57,882
Wake up!

1912
02:13:01,930 --> 02:13:02,969
Outside a Husband....

1913
02:13:03,650 --> 02:13:05,650
....Tell's a wife who has come after
mangling a woman me her Car!

1914
02:13:06,049 --> 02:13:07,850
....Don't worry,I'll look
after everything!

1915
02:13:11,890 --> 02:13:12,610
I have now,understood!!!

1916
02:13:19,610 --> 02:13:21,049
In future,there'll never
be a fight between us!

1917
02:13:26,570 --> 02:13:27,970
I can't live after
losing you!

1918
02:13:30,850 --> 02:13:31,330
Wake up!...

1919
02:13:41,010 --> 02:13:42,250
While loving you,I was always
with you chasing....

1920
02:13:44,410 --> 02:13:45,548
..That...that is not `LOVE'!!!

1921
02:13:55,092 --> 02:13:55,665
After losing you....

1922
02:13:57,770 --> 02:14:02,410
The way I roamed streets
searching for you...that is...

1923
02:14:07,850 --> 02:14:08,530
Shakthi! wake up!

1924
02:14:11,610 --> 02:14:12,370
Shakthi!...Please wake up!

1925
02:14:14,770 --> 02:14:18,290
Wake up...wake up...
Shakthi wake up!

1926
02:14:25,538 --> 02:14:26,658
Shakthi,don't be angry
on me!

1927
02:14:34,049 --> 02:14:35,290
I can't live without you!

1928
02:14:42,530 --> 02:14:43,410
Please,surive!

1929
02:16:23,570 --> 02:16:24,130
Got scared?

1930
02:16:26,610 --> 02:16:27,250
I lost my life!

1931
02:16:33,890 --> 02:16:34,770
If you lose your wife...

1932
02:16:40,410 --> 02:16:43,130
If you lose your wife,are you
planning to live happily?

1933
02:17:02,050 --> 02:17:03,330
Will you do anything
for me?

1934
02:17:10,049 --> 02:17:11,210
Will you jump out of the running
train for me?

1935
02:17:18,690 --> 02:17:19,650
What do you mean by it?

1936
02:17:26,050 --> 02:17:26,570
I don't know!!

1937
02:17:29,090 --> 02:17:30,130
...But I love you!

1938
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:41,050
...My pride has been destroyed!...
my pride has been destroyed!

1939
02:17:48,049 --> 02:17:55,049
My friend...my friend!..
my secret friend!

1940
02:17:57,049 --> 02:18:04,250
Listen to my small, small wishes!

1941
02:18:05,530 --> 02:18:12,970
Depthness...this some depthness!!
embrace...this same embrace

1942
02:18:14,810 --> 02:18:24,450
I want it till the end of life
I want it till the end of life!

1943
02:18:24,850 --> 02:18:32,049
My friend...My friend!
my secret friend!!

1944
02:19:08,850 --> 02:19:16,650
You tresspass little things! and make
my plant bloom with flowers!

1945
02:18:57,930 --> 02:19:26,049
Make the flowers blooms,and like
a flower plucking devotee!slowly...

1946
02:19:27,010 --> 02:19:30,370
While I am sleeping you'll
nip my nails!

1947
02:19:31,850 --> 02:19:35,450
you'll sleep soundlessly

1948
02:19:36,610 --> 02:19:43,650
You should stay near me and massage
with olive oil and do service to me!

1949
02:19:46,049 --> 02:19:52,850
When you cry,if it makes me also cry
I need your fingers to wipe my tears!

1950
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,699
Leave it means leave it

1951
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:56,100
Are you sure?

1952
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:00,699
Okay

1953
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:14,699
I pray to God that you get
an ugly & foolish wife!

1954
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,300
Be like this,don't change

1955
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,700
Always crying?

1956
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,900
No,always smiling!!

1957
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,940
For how many days you will
continue like this?

1958
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,500
What do you mean by
how many days?

1959
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,699
Hiding yourself like this instead of
train,you are going by bus,auto..

1960
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,699
If we leave anything we
should really leave it

1961
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,699
Instead we should not encourage love
its foolishness to test it

1962
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:42,699
I don't want to do that
foolishness

1963
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,699
What's it?

1964
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:57,100
We'll succeed like Bill Gates

1965
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,100
Or we'll go to jail like Financial
firms who won't return the deposits

1966
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,100
Begining itself,he is talking
negatively

1967
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:09,500
From today onwards,Cinema,House
Girls...all are stopped

1968
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:14,420
In the 1st year,we'll grow up
in Madras

1969
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:18,700
And in the 2nd year - All India No.1
In the 3rd year-International

1970
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,700
Future stars,shall we start
our work today itself?

1971
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:34,100
Hey! Take that camphor packet

1972
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:39,500
Karthik uncle,call for you

1973
00:43:39,699 --> 00:43:39,900
Who's it?

1974
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:42,699
Hey! It has become your habit,isn't it?

1975
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,300
Shakthi,why are you not
talking?

1976
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:04,420
Has the line got cut
-No

1977
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:05,100
Then talk...

1978
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,420
I won't listen to all
these things...

1979
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:36,660
Where is your father?

1980
00:44:37,699 --> 00:44:39,100
Hey! Where are you?

1981
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,100
Did you not say that after
finishing her Medicine -

1982
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,699
We'll perform the marriage of Shakthi
with my son?

1983
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:50,900
Mother,while coming from home
what did I say?

1984
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,900
You keep quiet

1985
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:53,699
Only she must have refused it

1986
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,699
She doesn't like our
family at all

1987
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,420
What all I did for him?

1988
00:44:58,699 --> 00:45:01,180
He had grown up by eating
my food...

1989
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,420
Hey! You have promised me! Don't
cheat your own sister

1990
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:07,100
Sister,who is cheating whom?

1991
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,180
How can I fix the marriage of Shakthi
before Poorni?

1992
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:12,300
Hey! Who got the job for you
in Railway?

1993
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,420
Why are you talking about
that now?

1994
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,699
After my husband's death,I recommended
you for that job

1995
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,300
Do I have to die returning
back that job?

1996
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:18,700
Father!!

1997
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:19,700
You will talk like this

1998
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:23,020
Your daughter has done Medicine
isn't it?

1999
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:25,100
I came here to remind you
that,don't forget us

2000
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:32,300
One day or other,this Aunty will
parcel you & take you in the bag

2001
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:36,180
Shakthi,have you got my point?

2002
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:42,100
Shakthi,they are starting the old stories
trying to marry you to him

2003
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,420
Be careful!

2004
00:45:56,500 --> 00:45:57,300
What are you doing here?

2005
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,100
Where is Shakthi?

2006
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:03,300
I thought you both had
separated

2007
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,700
Yes,but..

2008
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,699
Then what?

2009
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,420
Nothing,since 4-5 days she has not
to be seen...where is she?

2010
00:46:09,699 --> 00:46:10,420
She has gone to U.S

2011
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,700
Why?

2012
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,300
She has not gone to U.S

2013
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,420
She has gone for Medical
Camp,is it enough?

2014
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:23,700
Where?

2015
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,700
For 3 weeks

2016
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:26,700
3 weeks?!!

2017
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,699
Only for 3 weeks!! She will come back
here only

2018
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,500
How much money do you want?

2019
00:46:44,699 --> 00:46:45,300
Rs.2000/-

2020
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,699
Why that much money?

2021
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,180
Mother,I am going to town

2022
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,500
Don't ask me why?

2023
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:52,900
If father comes to know about this,he
will break the house into two

2024
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,100
Before that,you somehow arrange
the money & keep it

2025
00:46:55,699 --> 00:46:56,699
Is it for that girl?

2026
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:00,500
Bye!

2027
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,900
Be careful,come back quickly
