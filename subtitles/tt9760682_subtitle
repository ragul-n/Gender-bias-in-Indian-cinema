1
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,000
Ramya, please

2
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,920
I'm getting married next week

3
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,880
And if you behave like this, imagine 
what will everyone thing about me

4
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,440
We fell in love and had fun

5
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,120
I kept you happy and 
I was happy to do it

6
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,080
But not anymore

7
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,800
Please do not show 
up at my wedding

8
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,680
It'll be embarrassing if this goes 
to the level of involving the police

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,280
I'm about to reach home

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:52,960
Shall I make chappathis?

11
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,480
Ok dear

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:01:59,880
Ok

13
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,280
Roshan! What are you doing here?

14
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,400
Why did you come here?

15
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,400
Fine. Come in

16
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,840
If you are unable to forget the past...

17
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,440
then before my husband comes 
home, for one more time...

18
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,440
Title: BODHAI YERI BUDHI MAARI 
(Under the influence of drug)

19
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,520
Greetings, to one and all present here

20
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,560
Today, is our day!

21
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,880
26th of June...

22
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,720
Anti-drugs day!

23
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,080
Instead of being embarrassed about 
the few tragedies in our lives...

24
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,280
and if we share it among ourselves, we'll 
be relieved of our pains and burdens

25
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,320
First up, Mr. Krishna

26
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
First up, Mr. Krishna

27
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,520
I'm a chartered accountant

28
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,080
A good job

29
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,160
A beautiful wife

30
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,320
An angel like daughter

31
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,000
But we wanted more kids

32
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,240
Well, she had

33
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,440
Only the first child 
was sired by me

34
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,200
Yes!

35
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,120
She is not with me anymore

36
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,320
Our dreams are shattered

37
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,400
I became a drug addict

38
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,560
She begged and pleaded 
me to give it up

39
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,040
But I couldn't

40
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
I became incapable

41
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:10,760
She is just 26 years old

42
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,640
She is just 26 years old

43
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,000
She suffered a lot

44
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,840
Finally...

45
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:21,240
she made her up mind that she 
would be better off without me

46
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,640
And now...

47
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,200
I am unable to face her

48
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,640
Now, Nisha will share 
her experience with us

49
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,040
It hurts me to find 
myself in such a place

50
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,680
Yet all your love makes me happy

51
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,840
I lived my life in a wrong way

52
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,480
I have no one to talk to me

53
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:43,040
I keep staring at the 
walls of my room...

54
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,640
I keep staring at the 
walls of my room...

55
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,720
and I do it all day long

56
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,120
I have a big family

57
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,600
Not mine anymore

58
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:49,960
My own elder brother...

59
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
My own elder brother...

60
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,800
threw me out...

61
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,120
and he called me a prostitute

62
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,240
Let's promise Nisha that 
we'll lend our moral support

63
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,520
To make this day even special, we 
have a guest today in our center

64
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,920
He is Mr. Karthik

65
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,040
His wife is Mrs. Janani

66
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,080
And he has two little daughters

67
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,400
So, let's welcome Mr. Karthik

68
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,720
Hi everybody

69
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,400
Don't. Use. Drugs!

70
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,960
Initially we consume these drugs as stress 
buster but after a point it bursts up our lives

71
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,800
This is the story of most of 
your lives, who are sitting here

72
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,360
But the story of my life...

73
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
isn't a cliched ordinary story

74
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,280
Life is very beautiful

75
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,840
Life is very beautiful

76
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,480
But, in reality, the drugs we consume 
prevents us from living our beautiful lives

77
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,320
My reality is a lost cause

78
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:18,000
My family, mom, dad, my 
sister, Janani, friends...

79
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,680
all of them were pretty much with me

80
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
The next step in life was marriage

81
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,600
And it was all beautifully 
set up for me

82
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Three years ago...

83
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,880
One fine day...

84
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,320
How many of them are there?

85
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,680
- One, two, three... 
- Including the labors who are digging out there...

86
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,600
- I'm talking about 'Nalangu' custom 
- Oh I see

87
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,400
- Keeps talking nonsense 
- Ok, fine

88
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Why is she afraid of you? What did you do?

89
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,360
I didn't intimidate her too much

90
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,800
Whenever I go to meet my friends...

91
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,720
it's only during that 
time I talk to her

92
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,720
If you had just had 
casually spoke to her...

93
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,000
then why is she going to the 
extent of rejecting you?

94
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,520
I don't know

95
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,080
No one told me anything about it

96
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,560
I ain't also forcing her for this 
wedding or that I want her!

97
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,520
It's mom, who wants to resume ties and 
ensure it is strong with their family

98
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,600
It doesn't look me like you 
agreed to this for mom's sake

99
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,520
She is as beautiful as Alia Bhatt...

100
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,560
and looks like you fell for her

101
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't want him!

102
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Look, they are the best 
family among our relatives

103
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,360
Gayathri is a gem

104
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,440
Other families act according to their need

105
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,200
But this family? They 
are always the same

106
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,680
After marriage they will 
take care of very well

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,040
I hate this!

108
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,400
I hate this Nalangu!

109
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,480
I hate it when you fake a smile and 
invite people for the wedding!

110
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,440
Dad's spending all the money unnecessarily. 
I hate it all!

111
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,720
Girls who talk like you end up having two 
children after the first year of marriage

112
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,600
Mom, keep forcing me like 
this and I'll run away!

113
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,880
I'll break your legs! 
Then how will you run away?

114
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,880
Listen dear!

115
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,280
You better live up to that fear!

116
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,000
Mom...

117
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,240
my curses will get you someday!

118
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:06,720
Get lost!

119
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,360
Dear, keep this bag. There's money in it

120
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:16,400
Here's the list about payments. 
Make the payments accordingly

121
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,880
Provisions, catering...

122
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:19,400
Mom...

123
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,360
- I need one invitation 
- For whom?

124
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,120
Well, I have to invite one of my professors

125
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,760
Couldn't you have 
done it before?

126
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,400
He isn't in town, mom

127
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Call him up

128
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,520
Mom, that won't look good

129
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,760
Dear. Once the marriage customary flag is 
hoisted, no one should leave the house

130
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:36,880
Which era are you living in?

131
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,040
Which era are you living in?

132
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,520
This is 2018!

133
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,480
Let him go. Didn't you hear him 
say it is for someone important?

134
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,720
- Thanks dad 
- Come back soon

135
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,280
Ok mom

136
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:44,360
He isn't a new born baby. He isn't 
going to stay back over there

137
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,400
He isn't a new born baby. He isn't 
going to stay back over there

138
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,440
- Why are you scaring him? 
- Did speak so?

139
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,840
- Then what's your worry? 
- Well...

140
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,360
we must follow the 
customs set by elders

141
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,760
Do I look like a new born? 
I'm an elder too!

142
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,480
I can't argue with you

143
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,160
Speak the truth and 
you say I'm arguing

144
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,040
Bring me cup of coffee

145
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:02,720
Come on, dear groom

146
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,560
Come on, dear groom

147
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,120
- Uncle, please! Please! No 
- Just come on, dear. Come on!

148
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,880
Remove your footwear here and 
come in without making any noise

149
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,720
Dear groom, you have stepped 
in at the right time

150
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,400
'Nalangu' custom is about to get over

151
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,680
My brother and sister i.e your future 
father-in-law and mother-in-law

152
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,160
have gone to the beauty parlor

153
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,720
In order to develop their personalty

154
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,520
Fine, never mind. Come, 
let's meet my mother. Come on

155
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,440
Janani, feeling feverish?

156
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,920
She is ready for the marriage

157
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,080
Mom, look who's here. He is the groom

158
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,520
Greetings

159
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,920
Welcome

160
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,520
Groom forgot the way to our home and 
was standing lost by the tea shop

161
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,120
- I saw him and brought him here 
- No, I came to meet my professor

162
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,720
Oh yeah! Right! He came 
here to meet his professor

163
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,440
- Janani, make him some coffee 
- Ok granny

164
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,680
Why would uncle bring him 
here and torture me?

165
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,440
Janani...

166
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,960
so you guys secretly 
planned a meeting?

167
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,920
See that? I found him and got him here

168
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,920
I'll send in the groom. 
Make him a special coffee

169
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,920
Crazy uncle! To hell with his 
coffee and special coffee

170
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,520
Have some coffee 
and talk to Janani

171
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,760
I forgot my coolers at the salon. I'll 
go fetch that and come back very late

172
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,400
Sent?

173
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,960
You could've sent 
it in Whatsapp app

174
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:38,680
Fine, send and call me

175
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,720
Fine, send and call me

176
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,040
Hello

177
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:49,880
Sir! Tell me, sir

178
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,600
Sir! Tell me, sir

179
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,400
It can be done, sir

180
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,000
Sir...

181
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:54,960
Ok sir

182
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,400
I'll be there, sir

183
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,320
Sir!

184
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,560
Someone named David it seems

185
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,360
Guess, like Jesus, he 
follows the path of honesty

186
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,920
Also, do you know what...

187
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,080
he is just the Arrow

188
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,480
Not the Bow!

189
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,600
You could've come to my home, madam

190
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,320
Some other day, David

191
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,480
What about the CBI appointment?

192
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,840
I have requested

193
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,080
I don't know what's the delay

194
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,880
I don't know what's the delay

195
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
I'm thinking of moving 
through another source

196
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,080
No David. This move will be correct!

197
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,880
Told you! That I'll manage 
all this in Kolkatta

198
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,280
But it was you all 
who convinced me

199
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,280
You guys advised me 
to do it in Chennai

200
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,920
But this looks even more risky!

201
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,400
Lot of ministers are involved...

202
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,800
but none of them here knows them

203
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,120
But the whole world knows 
minister Raja Narayanan

204
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,800
And the reason behind it...

205
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,800
are these drugs

206
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,960
We cannot oppose this drugs 
mafia in any other way

207
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,200
You very well know, how 
secretly we filed this case

208
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
Only if it reaches the right place...

209
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,200
we can save the youngsters 
getting affected by this

210
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,720
Government opens liquor shops and 
spoil the youngsters on one hand...

211
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,160
and now these dangerous drugs!

212
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:21,320
Lives are getting ruined everywhere

213
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,840
Lives are getting ruined everywhere

214
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,280
We can't approach the court

215
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,000
Same case with human rights

216
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,560
We can't even approach the police

217
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,080
It's all corrupted

218
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,720
Our media...

219
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:30,960
will convey truth also 
through entertainment

220
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,240
will convey truth also 
through entertainment

221
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,240
And people won't believe it

222
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,640
Even CBI can be corrupted, madam

223
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,240
Comparatively it's less over there

224
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,920
He is one of us

225
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,880
A CBI office staff

226
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,560
Our spy

227
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:45,600
Looks like they approached 
the CBI for an appointment

228
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,800
Looks like they approached 
the CBI for an appointment

229
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,680
They have got the evidence

230
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,040
If it comes out, we'll be in soup

231
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,000
Because those are about new drugs. Later, 
no foreigner will trust us or deal with us

232
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,400
We'll have to go back to 
our illegal Toddy business

233
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:58,440
You'll get your usual bribe of Rs. 5000/-

234
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,960
You'll get your usual bribe of Rs. 5000/-

235
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,520
Should we live like beggars again?

236
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,960
That Bow behind this Arrow should die

237
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,240
We are fighting against giants

238
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
Worse come we'll lose 
our lives, that's all

239
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,600
But before losing our lives we 
must expose this mafia group

240
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,800
And our only hope...

241
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,520
is CBI department

242
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,240
Ok madam

243
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:21,480
I shall try through Malhothra

244
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,400
I feel something 
fishy about this

245
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,880
I doubt if the minister knows that we 
are the ones who stole the evidence

246
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,920
Oh! Is that why...

247
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,040
we are not still getting 
an appointment?

248
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,280
Could be

249
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:37,960
Please stay safe

250
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,360
Please stay safe

251
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,360
Ok madam

252
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,520
I hope you have a 
copy of the hard disk

253
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,360
- Yes, madam. I have it 
- Ok

254
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,120
When it comes to murder...

255
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:47,400
Only you can do a clean job

256
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,760
Only you can do a clean job

257
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,320
So do it

258
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:07,760
Hello

259
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,600
Buddy...

260
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,640
- Who is it? 
- Buddy, it's me, Murali

261
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,160
Murali! Speak up!

262
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,040
Why are you crying?

263
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,600
Buddy...

264
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:20,600
What happened?

265
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,440
What happened?

266
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:21,800
Roshan...

267
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,000
Roshan...

268
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
What happened to Roshan?

269
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,960
Roshan...

270
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,680
he committed suicide!

271
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,840
What do you mean?

272
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,000
He is no more?

273
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,400
He is no more!

274
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,440
Come in, buddy

275
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,480
Come in

276
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,520
What happened?

277
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,080
Buddy!

278
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:56,680
- Roshan is no more 
- But why did he do this?

279
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,640
- Roshan is no more 
- But why did he do this?

280
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
No idea. Don't know what happened

281
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,600
We came here, only to see his 
corpse lying in the room

282
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,640
Buddy!

283
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,200
He left us without 
even a goodbye

284
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,000
Where is he?

285
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,200
He is in the room

286
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,240
Come

287
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,320
- He left us 
- Look at him

288
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,560
- Come 
- Come on

289
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,360
Come inside and look

290
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:17,880
Look at him

291
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
Look at him

292
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,640
- Come 
- Roshan

293
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,200
See that?

294
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,480
Look at his plight

295
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,840
Did you inform his parents?

296
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,600
Not yet. We have no 
idea what to do now

297
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,520
Get lost!

298
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,480
Get lost you guys!

299
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,040
Where are you off to? Wait buddy

300
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,920
- Are you guys nuts? 
- Come on, buddy

301
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,680
- Get lost! Let go of me 
- Come on, buddy

302
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,920
- Let go of me! 
- Come on, buddy. It was just for fun

303
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,200
What kind of prank was that?

304
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,560
I getting married tomorrow and how 
dare you play a prank like this?

305
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,440
- Don't behave like retards! 
- Go, calm him down

306
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,840
- Buddy, please listen 
- Calm down

307
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,240
Let go of me!

308
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,280
Just one more day to go, buddy. Hence 
we played a prank. Come on now

309
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,960
Damn! Whose idea was it?

310
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,640
- It was his idea 
- Hi buddy

311
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,760
Haven't you guys grown up yet?

312
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,440
Come on, forgive us. 
We did it just for fun

313
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,160
Come on. Now, don't show off. Only 
one more day to go, isn't it?

314
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,960
I'll be here only for two hours

315
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,640
I must go

316
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,200
This is your bachelor's party. Can't 
you spend three hours with us?

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,800
Try to understand

318
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,680
Must follow 'Nalangu' custom

319
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,440
- Happy 'Nalangu' day 
- Shut up!

320
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,440
I have brought chicken. 
Let's cook

321
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,240
Yes, then let's eat and 
sleep off here itself

322
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,080
What are you looking at? Now, pour

323
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,880
- I said, pour 
- No dude. I'm already feeling high

324
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,560
High? Just by looking at the bottle?

325
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,840
Not because of the bottle

326
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,920
Remember the foreign 
lady we saw in the lift?

327
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,600
From the moment I 
laid eyes on her...

328
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:26,680
She isn't a foreigner. 
She is from Pallavaram

329
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,480
She isn't a foreigner. 
She is from Pallavaram

330
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,920
She has a very good reputation

331
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,320
She's a journalist

332
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,040
She has won many awards

333
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:33,680
- What''s her name? 
- Like that's very important

334
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,400
- What''s her name? 
- Like that's very important

335
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,600
Brindha

336
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:38,560
Brindha

337
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,320
Brindha!

338
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,080
Brindha...Murali

339
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,680
Listen, pour a drink then talk!

340
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,000
Wait. Tell me more 
about that girl

341
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,280
Look she is not a girl but an aunty

342
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,200
Dude, please. Pour a drink

343
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,800
Wait! Wait! Donâ€™t you drink 
and get wasted like always!

344
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,560
Instead we can't listen 
to your boring jokes!

345
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,200
Let go of it! I said, leave it!

346
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Murali, let go of it. 
Murali, come on!

347
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Come on, guys. Stop fighting

348
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,400
Fine! Pour

349
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,200
You guys are not even drunk and already 
look at the ruckus you guys are creating

350
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:08,920
Once drunk...

351
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,160
we'll raise hell!

352
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,760
Pass me the water

353
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,440
- Show me your glass 
- Here

354
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,360
Let's a raise a toast and celebrate 
for our Karthik's wedding!

355
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,880
Cheers!

356
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,000
- Aiyo! Jesus 
- Careful, buddy

357
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,720
Why are you abusing him?

358
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,800
What happened?

359
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,960
- What happened? 
- No idea, buddy

360
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,160
Did you give it to him neat?

361
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,880
He poured me a neat round

362
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,000
Come on, buddy. Why would you do so?

363
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Here, have some chips

364
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,000
Here you go

365
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,480
Here you go

366
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
Leave it. I'll pour it myself

367
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,480
Dude...

368
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:52,480
is Brindha really married?

369
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,880
is Brindha really married?

370
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,600
Why would you do that?

371
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,480
Roshan, where are the playing cards?

372
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,240
Look around and you'll find it

373
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,800
Don't you fill in the ice tray?

374
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:06,960
Why do you need ice cream while boozing?

375
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,680
Why do you need ice cream while boozing?

376
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,800
I said ice tray with ice 
cubes not ice cream

377
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,600
Roshan, what about the chicken dish?

378
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,640
Stop it you glutton! Chicken will 
be ready after this round of drink

379
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,040
Roshan, why is this room locked?

380
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,280
Go check in the other room

381
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,680
Tell me, sir

382
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,160
Whom are you looking for?

383
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,040
David...

384
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,840
I need to talk with you

385
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,720
Do you know me?

386
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,360
- Don't you know me? 
- No, I don't, sir

387
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,440
Can we take this inside?

388
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:02,680
Just five minutes

389
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,440
Just five minutes

390
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:04,720
Who is it?

391
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,080
A friend

392
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:06,440
Oh, is it?

393
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Oh, is it?

394
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:07,880
Please come in

395
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,840
Please come in

396
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,240
Have a seat. I'll 
go make some coffee

397
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,040
'98 IPS batch

398
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
You must have heard of Nagpur...

399
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,120
Five years over there

400
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,120
Just like my role model police...

401
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,080
I too wish to serve the people

402
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,160
But then...

403
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,920
But then...

404
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,720
the situation is 
different over here

405
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,040
An honest officer has another name

406
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,640
A fool!

407
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,800
I don't prefer to be a fool

408
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:42,320
According to the ways 
of this society...

409
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,960
According to the ways 
of this society...

410
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,160
I have been forced to change

411
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,720
Youths are leading from the front 
everywhere and in everything

412
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,320
They are curious to 
explore new things

413
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,840
Even with drugs

414
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:58,600
Humans need some kind of drug

415
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,160
Humans need some kind of drug

416
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:03,520
Isn't it?

417
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,240
Isn't it?

418
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,360
Instead you guys form a team...

419
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,200
collect evidences...

420
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,160
collect evidences...

421
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,080
Awesome job!

422
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,960
But you shouldn't have got caught

423
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,040
Without success...

424
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,080
all that hard work is 
nothing but a waste

425
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,560
Who is that other woman who 
is along with you in this?

426
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,760
Go, find it yourself

427
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,360
Isn't that your job?

428
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,520
David!

429
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:32,800
Dear...

430
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,120
coffee

431
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:40,880
Andrew

432
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,040
Mommy

433
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,360
- There you are 
- Come, let's go inside, mom

434
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,520
You have a kind heart

435
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,560
Which is why you want good 
things to happen for everyone

436
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,240
Now, when you're not around...

437
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,680
who takes care of Stella?

438
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,640
In which grade is your son studying?

439
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,480
Didn't you understand my question?

440
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:05,560
Imagine this, if you die now...

441
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,360
Imagine this, if you die now...

442
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,720
then who will take care 
of Stella and Andrew?

443
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,480
They are capable of 
taking care of themselves

444
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,680
Of course. Of course

445
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,760
Everyone knows to take 
care of themselves

446
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,680
But then...

447
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:23,880
not you

448
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,120
not you

449
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,640
You think so

450
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,760
It's not important just to 
take care of our lives...

451
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,880
what's very important is to fight for 
the truth even at the cost of our lives

452
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,400
So, you have decided 
to give up your life?

453
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,720
David...

454
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,840
David?

455
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,280
Mommy...

456
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,240
Look at daddy. He is bleeding

457
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:28,840
David!

458
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,560
Guys, pool in the money

459
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,360
Here is my bet

460
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,160
- Mine 
- I don't have. Someone lend me some

461
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,480
Pour a drink for me

462
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:43,720
He never has money with him and 
won't take it our even if he has

463
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,480
He never has money with him and 
won't take it our even if he has

464
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,600
Excuse me...

465
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:48,960
Stop it right there

466
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,160
Don't you talk about it

467
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:55,400
Now, play

468
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,800
Now, play

469
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,160
So, did your sister, 
Gayatri, inquire about us?

470
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,000
She was pissed off at you all

471
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,680
I told her that all 
of you are boozing

472
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,400
- You told her so? 
- Yes

473
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,240
Aiyo! All my reputation is lost! 
It's embarrassing

474
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:08,760
Dude...

475
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:13,240
Don't you talk about getting embarrassed. 
It would be embarrassing for embarrassment

476
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,520
What are you both up to? 
How much did you drink?

477
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,320
Didn't you count?

478
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,080
- I must do that? 
- Do it! Count

479
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,800
One who drinks within 
limits is a real man

480
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,680
One who drinks without 
limits is a great man

481
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,320
We fall in the category 
of 'great man'

482
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:24,680
Buddy...

483
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,440
Buddy...

484
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,760
guess what happened today

485
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,920
- I went to Janani's house 
- Awesome

486
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,360
Her uncle thought I 
was there to meet her

487
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,920
- He dragged me to her 
- Then?

488
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,320
Fine, I obliged

489
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,640
He ordered her to make me 
some coffee and he left

490
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,480
Well, it was the perfect time

491
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,080
I asked her why she was 
not willing to marry me

492
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,840
She gave me three stupid reasons

493
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:51,880
One...

494
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,560
you always ragged me in the college. 
You have no idea how it affected me

495
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,440
Then?

496
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,120
Two...

497
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,000
At Saranya's wedding, you told Divya 
that I didn't have a good dressing sense

498
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,200
I say you don't have common sense at all! 
Dressing is out of question

499
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,440
Well, all these are fine

500
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,280
I was chubby during childhood

501
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,960
Yet you still address me as 'fatso'

502
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,320
Not just in childhood...

503
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,720
You have no idea how 
embarrassing it is for me

504
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,480
Oh! Come on. So if I explain why I 
said so, will you agree to marry me?

505
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:23,880
No, I won't

506
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:25,960
Then why should I 
give an explanation

507
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,160
What's that?

508
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,640
And my coffee?

509
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,160
She made it and left 
it in the kitchen

510
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,800
Then what happened?

511
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,440
Coffee...

512
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:49,800
was good

513
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,240
Stop it!

514
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:54,840
It hurts!

515
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,200
It hurts!

516
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,400
Look at the phone

517
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,560
It's broken. Do you 
have a spare phone

518
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,080
And this is the love 
I have upon you

519
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,320
If you are still not interested...

520
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
go lodge a complaint 
with the police

521
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,680
If you are interested, then wear the traditional 
Pattu saree and show up at the wedding

522
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,200
We're boozing and we can make boring 
jokes but your story was even boring

523
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,640
- God, save me! 
- Is it?

524
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,320
Come to me asking for my 
credit card next time...

525
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,920
- I'll give you a fitting reply 
- Sorry

526
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,880
You carry on...

527
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,360
Buddy...

528
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,320
it's time for good music

529
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,960
( 'Ganja gun' by Bob Marley playing)

530
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,040
Hello...

531
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:44,600
Where are you?

532
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
Where are you?

533
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,840
I'm at Roshan's house

534
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,440
What are you doing there?

535
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,480
We are just hanging out

536
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,720
This is why I told you 
don't go out anywhere

537
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,320
Mom, the wedding's tomorrow. Why 
are you torturing me today?

538
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,520
I'll be home in two hours. 
Now, hang up

539
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:56,640
You just don't pay heed 
to anything I say!

540
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,240
You just don't pay heed 
to anything I say!

541
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,240
Didn't you shut me up 
when I told you so?

542
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
Now look, our son is 
at Roshan's house

543
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,000
Mom, he'll be back

544
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,320
Why are you getting tensed? 
Don't you know him?

545
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:07,800
Dad, coffee?

546
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,880
Dad, coffee?

547
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,720
Ok, make your mom a good coffee

548
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,560
Dude, ask Siddique 
about the money

549
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,800
I'll ask

550
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Do you have any idea how much I toiled hard 
to make that money before giving it to him?

551
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:22,520
Ask him and every time 
he says he is broke

552
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:22,560
We'll ask. Wait

553
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,720
We'll ask. Wait

554
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,560
It's not for me 
but for my sister

555
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,600
Every time I ask him the money, 
he doesn't reply properly

556
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,120
I understand

557
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
This is not the time. You are drunk

558
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,520
Will you ask him or should I ask?

559
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,200
Wanna challenge?

560
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,600
A challenge to see who drinks 
the most number of rounds, neat

561
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,200
Challenge!

562
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,480
- Bet? 
- Yes!

563
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,280
- Think twice before betting with me 
- This is unnecessary

564
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,360
Dude, you just sit 
aside and watch me!

565
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,520
What's the bet?

566
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,640
If you lose, every expense of the party 
is on you until the marriage is over

567
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,640
- Fine! Now, pour 
- Roshan, come here and see what's going on!

568
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,240
Come on! Stop it, guys!

569
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,640
Catch him!

570
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,320
Look at him fall

571
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,160
There you go, Panda!

572
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,000
- Lift him 
- Get him to sit

573
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,680
- Why did you vomit here? 
- Get some water

574
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,800
Why would keep the 
shelf on the pathway?

575
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:06,840
Panda!

576
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
Awesome level?

577
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,760
Get lost!

578
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,200
This is very rare in 
our country, right?

579
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,400
Says who?

580
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,800
Dude, like how we are high on booze...

581
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,800
the rich people get high on these stuffs

582
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,680
Isn't it illegal?

583
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,720
Of course

584
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,000
But you can get it

585
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,480
In Chennai? Stop bluffing

586
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,200
Are you serious or just kidding?

587
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,280
I'm serious. It'll be 
available in Chennai...

588
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,480
but can you get it?

589
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,920
Your parents raised you without 
exposing to the world, very innocent

590
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,440
You can get it here for sure

591
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:07,560
Where?

592
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,480
Why did he get up?

593
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,040
What?

594
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,080
Why aren't you answering me?

595
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,880
What's with the suspense? 
I'm talking to you

596
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,280
Go, sit there

597
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
Why is this in your possession?

598
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,400
I got it. Hence I saved it

599
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,160
Have you ever consumed it?

600
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,640
I have

601
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,920
But this one is a new 
drug in our place

602
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,040
Usually the stuffs are white in color

603
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,200
But since this is red in color, there is 
lot of adulteration with Kumkum powder

604
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,960
Won't the police arrest 
if you possess this?

605
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,200
Only if they find out

606
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,960
Guess the price

607
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,240
No idea

608
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,480
Make a guess

609
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,280
Say 2000 rupees?

610
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,720
One gram costs 10,000/- rupees

611
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,600
So costly?

612
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,240
So, imagine it's effects

613
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:52,520
This one, right here is the king 
to other drugs like weed, LSD etc

614
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:55,880
This one, right here is the king 
to other drugs like weed, LSD etc

615
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,320
You will experience the world 
that you imagine, for real

616
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,680
But this is very dangerous

617
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,640
I just used it once but 
after that I never used it

618
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,920
One must get used to this

619
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,800
Inhaling it for the first time is equivalent 
to letting a wild elephant lose on the city

620
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,160
You must be very careful

621
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,720
How do you consume it?

622
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,160
This way

623
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,400
Are you going to inhale it now?

624
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,000
Nope. I just did it 
because you asked

625
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Give it to me

626
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,120
For what?

627
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:37,720
Give it to me

628
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,680
What are you up to?

629
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,360
Take out your mobile

630
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,040
- Come on, take it out 
- Careful

631
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,080
Let's scare Janani

632
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,760
Let's tell her I am drug addict

633
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,040
Poor girl

634
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:52,360
Joke and she will still 
consider it a serious thing

635
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,640
Joke and she will still 
consider it a serious thing

636
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,640
Making fun of her 
is a so much fun

637
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,280
I'll pose as if I'm sniffing 
it and you click it

638
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,320
- Come on! Come on! 
- Be careful

639
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,720
A little more closer

640
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,400
- Ok 
- Little more

641
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,960
- How about now? Good? 
- Yes

642
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,000
Come on, closer. Come closer

643
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,400
Come on, closer. Come closer

644
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,920
He just sniffed it up!

645
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,560
Why did you introduce 
him to this stuff?

646
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,920
I did it because he asked for it

647
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,440
Damn! He has to go home!

648
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,760
' I am the king and I have no rules!'

649
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,480
' The drug is my throne and it drives me'

650
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,000
' This feeling is new and better than 
all that I have experienced before'

651
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,600
' All my worries flew 
away and I feel so light'

652
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,400
' I am flying so high and I feel so light'

653
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,920
' So freak out and raise hell!'

654
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,680
' I am a virgin stoner'

655
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,280
- It'll wear off in five hours 
- ' I am a virgin stoner'

656
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,440
- It'll wear off in five hours 
- ' I am a virgin stoner'

657
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,800
- Are you alright, Karthik? 
- ' I am a virgin stoner'

658
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,600
' I am a virgin stoner'

659
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:30,400
' I am the king and I have no rules!'

660
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,040
' I am the king and I have no rules!'

661
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:37,560
' The drug is my throne and it drives me'

662
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,080
' This feeling is new and better than 
all that I have experienced before'

663
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,640
' All my worries flew 
away and I feel so light'

664
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,280
' I am flying so high and I feel so light'

665
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,240
' I am flying so high and I feel so light'

666
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,840
' So freak out and raise hell!'

667
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,440
' I am a virgin stoner'

668
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,600
' I am a virgin stoner'

669
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,760
He is high!

670
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,880
- Guys, what are you doing inside? Come out! 
- They are calling us out!

671
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,360
' I am a virgin stoner'

672
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,720
Don't tell the guys about this

673
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,000
I won't. Make sure you don't

674
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,480
- Come out, guys. What are you doing in there? 
- Quick!

675
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,360
- Come, let's go out 
- Come out, guys

676
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,160
' I am teetotaler and an 
innocent little mommas boy'

677
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,520
' I am a very disciplined VIP'

678
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,240
' There is no one like me. 
I was never a bad guy'

679
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,240
' Now hit me up with the booze'

680
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,920
' Follow it up with some coke'

681
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,720
' And without the stuff 
we will lose ourselves'

682
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,560
' Just like dust, my desires popped out'

683
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,160
' Without a second though I 
sniffed it up and it hit me up'

684
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,520
'Virgin stoner'

685
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,800
' Buddy, light up that joint'

686
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,880
' I am virgin stoner'

687
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,520
' Yes, exactly! Just like that. 
Light it up'

688
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,560
' I am virgin stoner'

689
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,040
' Lighted it up, buddy?'

690
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,480
' I am a virgin stoner'

691
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:30,280
' Awesome stuff!'

692
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,640
'Superb! Light up that joint'

693
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,520
' Do you have the chimney? Get it!'

694
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,000
' Awesome stuff, dude!'

695
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,160
Guys, I feel so fresh

696
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,840
Come on, let's start afresh

697
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
- Pour a drink 
- What? A drink?

698
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,200
Losers don't deserve to drink. 
Shut up and sit down!

699
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,280
I too have lost my kick. 
Pour me a drink too

700
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,240
- Like there is booze left 
- Where is the booze?

701
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,920
There's no booze?

702
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,560
What? There's no booze?

703
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,360
Why are you quiet?

704
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,960
Listen, there is neither booze 
nor any ingredients to cook

705
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,280
Go buy booze and provisions

706
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,680
- Ok 
- Make it fast

707
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,640
Make it fast

708
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,640
I'm going to buy. Anybody 
wants to join me? Murali?

709
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,600
- I'll come 
- Come on

710
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,320
Sir...

711
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,440
Let's inform at the station once

712
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,480
I'll take care of that

713
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,920
- Hi sir 
- Hi

714
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:53,800
Who are they?

715
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:54,600
My friends

716
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,400
My friends

717
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,200
Hello sir, I'm Murali

718
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,720
He is so huge

719
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,640
Genetic disorder?

720
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,560
Shut up and come

721
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,520
Hi

722
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:38,920
Hi

723
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:39,960
Five minutes

724
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,320
Ok

725
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,320
She is a very nice person

726
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,360
But they are living like a 
family without tying the knot

727
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:54,560
I wonder how

728
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,640
I wonder how

729
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,360
Sir, that's called Living together

730
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,880
What is that?

731
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,440
Sir, husband and wife 
can never be friends...

732
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,760
so instead be friends and live like this. 
There won't be any problem

733
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:05,960
Shut up man!

734
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,360
Problems are part of our lives

735
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,640
Don't talk nonsense

736
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:12,120
Look at me

737
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,920
Look at me

738
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,280
For ten years, I have been running my 
life being diagnosed with a disease

739
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,400
Does anyone know about it?

740
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:16,880
No

741
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,880
If the department finds out...

742
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,760
I'll lose my job!

743
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,880
Then I can't earn 
my bread and butter

744
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,120
Do you know anyone named David?

745
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,760
He is put up at Adyar

746
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,160
A journalist

747
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,440
Has a beautiful child 
and a beautiful wife

748
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:44,520
Poor wife...

749
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,000
Poor wife...

750
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,960
she lost her sight 
since her birth

751
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:47,760
What happened to David?

752
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,800
What happened to David?

753
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:50,560
He is no more

754
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,440
It's unfair that he died

755
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:57,960
Brindha...

756
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,240
this is...

757
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,600
none of your business

758
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,360
They are...

759
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,920
big shots

760
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,360
Do you understand 
the word Mafia?

761
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,280
Assisting a leader and learning some 
valuable social responsibilities...

762
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,080
Then turning into a rebel and 
talk about changing the country

763
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,640
Finally, only to find yourself alone and die 
mercilessly. Is that what you wish for?

764
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,040
Your greed for money and power...

765
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,120
and to divert youngsters into a wrong 
path for that; do you think it's right?

766
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:25,920
Look here...

767
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,360
No one's diverting anyone here

768
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:28,680
Everyone is responsible for their life

769
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,280
Everyone is responsible for their life

770
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,080
Let them decide how 
to live their lives

771
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,520
We must teach them what is 
right and what is wrong

772
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,440
No one's gonna listen if you teach. Got it?

773
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,040
Ok, then I don't have 
to listen to you!

774
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:45,840
Brindha...

775
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,560
my sin is that I fell in love with you

776
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,640
I didn't expect that 
you'll be such a crook!

777
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,480
I'm looking for evidences 
out there but...

778
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,120
you are one of the major evidence 
and you're right next to me

779
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,600
Are you mad?

780
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,920
If you don't listen to me...

781
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:02,240
Like David, they'll kill you

782
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:05,000
They'll kill me or you?

783
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,920
Answer me! Will you kill me?

784
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,040
Brindha...

785
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,720
Will you kill me? Will you?

786
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,200
- Brindha... 
- Will you kill me?

787
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,720
Brindha!

788
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,920
I have booked your 
flight tickets

789
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,200
Stay abroad for sometime

790
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,040
Just be my lover!

791
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:28,440
Stop your journalism and being 
a rebel right here, right now!

792
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,160
Got it?

793
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:31,280
I fell in love with my 
profession before I fell for you

794
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,920
I fell in love with my 
profession before I fell for you

795
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,000
I can't give it up for you

796
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,080
I understand what is Mafia

797
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,640
I also know how to put an end to it

798
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,600
And I also know you'll be 
destroyed in that process

799
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,640
Give it your best shot!

800
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,320
I'm talking about our welfare

801
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,000
The flight leaves in six hours

802
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,240
Give it a good thought and make a call

803
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,920
There is no holiday for 
us even during festivals

804
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:19,880
Sir is here

805
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,360
Sir...

806
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,200
- Brindha shouldn't step out 
- Ok sir

807
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,240
Stay here and guard her

808
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,320
- I'll be back 
- Ok sir

809
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,800
Sir! Sir! Sir!

810
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,440
Sir, please sir. Please sir

811
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,080
Sir, we'll take care 
of these youngsters

812
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,960
- Sir, please 
- Please

813
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,360
He is getting married tomorrow

814
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,520
His wife is very beautiful like yours

815
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,960
Are you guys drunk?

816
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:44,920
No idea

817
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,360
Sir, today is Saturday 
and we are I.T guys

818
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,280
- Move! 
- Come on, guys

819
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:49,760
Move!

820
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
Is Saturday reserved as a 
mandatory drinking day?

821
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:52,760
Come on

822
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,000
- I said move! 
- Move!

823
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,400
- I said move! 
- Move!

824
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,800
Look at them having fun

825
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,040
You drunken monk! Get up

826
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:58,880
Booze?

827
00:44:58,880 --> 00:44:59,920
Sit down, buddy

828
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,320
I love you, dear

829
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:03,960
Awesome!

830
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,200
Why is he showing off? 
Shall I finish him off?

831
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,000
Come on, after all 
Prem is our friend

832
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,640
- I'm not talking about Prem 
- He is the commissioner! Shut up!

833
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,600
Is that suppose to intimidate me?

834
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,280
Buddy, life is so full 
of fun and happening...

835
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,680
where will all this lead to?

836
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,800
It'll lead to a place 
where we'll find bliss

837
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,680
Find bliss? What's that?

838
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,720
To remain silent 
without any thoughts

839
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:29,040
That what I'm doing already. 
I don't think at all

840
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,760
Indeed buddy. So, you don't 
think about anything at all?

841
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,520
Don't you think about how much to drink and 
how to gobble up food before anyone eats it

842
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,040
Don't speak your heart

843
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,400
Cheers buddy

844
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,800
Great sages are in that state

845
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,120
They live in forest

846
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,520
And that too alone

847
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,920
They don't have to think about anything

848
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,800
We have 1000 things 
to worry about

849
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,320
And if you have a friend like 
him then your life is ruined

850
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,720
Ramesh, shut up!

851
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:09,880
You shut up!

852
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,600
You shut up!

853
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,360
When are you gonna return my money?

854
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,560
- Didn't you ask for an Apple laptop? 
- Yes

855
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,560
I told you that my friend is in U.S and if 
you give him the money, he'll get it for you

856
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,080
Forget the laptop. Give me the money

857
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:23,440
You gave me the money, I transferred 
it to him and he got the laptop

858
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,800
He is stuck with some Visa issue 
and his return is delayed

859
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,080
What can I do about it?

860
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,600
How long do I wait? Ask 
him to return the money

861
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:32,560
Look, he agreed to help and 
you must be thankful for that

862
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,880
Thanks for his help but enough

863
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,800
- Ask him to return the money 
- No way!

864
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,960
Didn't he say that his friend got the laptop 
then why do you keep asking the money?

865
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,480
You mind your own business

866
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:42,120
It's not your money

867
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,920
If it was my money, I 
wouldn't be asking him back

868
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,600
My foot!

869
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,240
When will you return my money?

870
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,240
I cannot!

871
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,600
Don't you show this attitude 
after taking the money!

872
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:50,800
I said I can't! Now, shut up!

873
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,240
- Please madam 
- What is it?

874
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:03,880
Where are you off to, madam?

875
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,800
Why do you care?

876
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:05,440
We have been ordered by our senior, 
not to let you out anywhere

877
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,520
We have been ordered by our senior, 
not to let you out anywhere

878
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,920
Look here...

879
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,840
I decide if I wanna 
go out or not!

880
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,440
Neither you nor your 
senior decides that!

881
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:14,680
Madam, it's our boss' order

882
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,320
Madam, it's our boss' order

883
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,720
So just obey and stay back!

884
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,000
Stop talking rules to us

885
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,120
We are police

886
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,880
Hold on. Can't you see 
I'm explaining it to her

887
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,680
Ma'am...

888
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:28,800
our boss has strictly ordered 
us not to let you out

889
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,840
If we let you go out...

890
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:31,320
then we'll lose our jobs

891
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,920
then we'll lose our jobs

892
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,280
So please

893
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,640
Please ma'am

894
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,000
Please try to understand

895
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,920
Bro, can do me a favor?

896
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,000
Wow!

897
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,120
Karthik

898
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:32,960
Mechanical engineering

899
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:34,440
Mechanical engineering

900
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,040
Sairam college

901
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,000
Sairam college

902
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,640
2012 passed out

903
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,640
But...

904
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,200
I'm getting married tomorrow

905
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,240
Ok fine

906
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:47,760
Karthik...

907
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,400
it's very urgent

908
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,400
Will you listen to me?

909
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:53,960
This is an important hard disk

910
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,240
Can you take care of it for me

911
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,240
I'll take it back later

912
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,560
We are friends?

913
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,400
Ok

914
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:05,880
Friends!

915
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:06,360
Friends!

916
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,880
Karthik, please keep it 
safely, somewhere inside

917
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:13,600
Ok. Ok!

918
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,040
- Damn you! 
- Shut up!

919
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,000
Let go of me!

920
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,120
Guys no! No! Listen!

921
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,880
Stop fighting guys!

922
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,440
- Guys, listen 
- I said, move all of you!

923
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,800
Guys, enough is enough!

924
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,200
Stop fightin, guys!

925
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,400
Guys! Guys! Stop it!

926
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:45,760
Karky...

927
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:51,280
Ramesh, this is all because of you

928
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,920
Because of me? Was it wrong that I liked 
something and asked him to buy it for me

929
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,240
He took the money but no reply so far! 
This fellow!

930
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,640
- Look, you are going off the limits! 
- Shut up!

931
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,800
- This party is happening because of me! 
- Stop provoking him

932
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,640
So, don't spoil it!

933
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,680
Why let him talk but if 
he talks you yell at him?

934
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,520
Buddy, quiet now

935
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,720
Is your friend returning 
from U.S or not?

936
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:11,280
He'll come

937
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,440
Ask him to get some booze too

938
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,440
Shut up! Doesn't have sense 
on what to talk when!

939
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,560
Look here!

940
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,280
I can't return the money! 
Do whatever you can!

941
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:22,560
Guys!

942
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,280
Stop fighting over money, guys!

943
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,800
- Stop it guys 
- Come on, I said stop it!

944
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,040
Move!

945
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:34,600
You decide!

946
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,160
Stay friends with 
them and that's it!

947
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,840
Then I won't be 
your friend anymore

948
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,720
Decide whom you want 
to be friends with

949
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:42,280
To hell with your friendship! Get lost!

950
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:43,800
To hell with your friendship! Get lost!

951
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,680
- You don't have to say it! 
- You shut up!

952
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,760
Damn it! Who else do 
you want it to say?

953
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,960
- Shut up! 
- This party was organized on my orders

954
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,600
Then this issue is 
because of you!

955
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,840
Right! Now blame me for everything!

956
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,080
Prem, come on. Let's leave

957
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,200
Prem, come on. Let's leave

958
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:57,840
If he attends your wedding, I won't

959
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,960
Leave! Leave at once!

960
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:04,840
Let me go! I said, leave me

961
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:05,520
Look here...

962
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:10,760
Told you, don't yell!

963
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,280
Sorry dude

964
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,600
What is it, sir?

965
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:17,160
Sir...

966
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,080
I need water to take my medicines

967
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,640
Ok

968
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,640
Prem, get some water

969
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:23,720
Panda! Not booze!

970
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,840
Panda! Not booze!

971
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,080
Quiet guys!

972
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,880
Water...

973
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,720
- I have a heart problem. I gotta take the medicine 
- Careful. Hold on, sir

974
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,560
Make it fast!

975
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:37,640
Buddy, no! Not him!

976
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:38,680
Hold him! Catch him!

977
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:41,160
Hold him! Catch him!

978
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:44,800
Sir! Sir! Are you alright?

979
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,560
Sir! Sir! Are you alright?

980
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:49,880
Get the water, quick!

981
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,200
Sir! Sir!

982
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:54,560
Karthik, listen to me! 
No! Don't do this!

983
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:57,560
Karthik, nothing to worry

984
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:59,480
Quiet down, Karthik! Quite down

985
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,440
- Looks like the drug is taking its effect 
- Drugs?

986
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,480
- What drugs? 
- Nothing! Just hold his leg

987
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:07,720
How do we control him?

988
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:10,800
Feed him some booze and we 
can bring him under control

989
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,080
Stop talking like a nut!

990
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,720
We have no other go! Go get it!

991
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,960
You go, get the booze

992
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,200
We have no other go. Hold him!

993
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,640
Dude, please be quiet! Please

994
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:18,880
Can't you see? There is some problem

995
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,200
To hell with it. Unnecessarily...

996
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,440
What happened?

997
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,800
To hell with you! Get lost!

998
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,720
Something is fishy! Let's leave. Come on

999
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,200
- Come on! Come on! 
- Quick! Quick!

1000
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:29,720
Hold him!

1001
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:31,200
Wait. Hold on

1002
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:32,920
Feed him the booze! Do it

1003
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,000
Feed him! Come on! Do it

1004
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,520
Quiet! Quiet...

1005
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:37,360
He is spitting it out

1006
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,240
He is spitting it out

1007
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,160
Careful. I have an idea

1008
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,880
- Make it fast. Where are you going? 
- To get a funnel

1009
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,240
Get it quickly!

1010
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,000
Make it fast!

1011
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,320
Move! Move! Move!

1012
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:46,440
- Quick! Quick! 
- Hold him! Hold him!

1013
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,200
- Quick! Quick! 
- Hold him! Hold him!

1014
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,080
Feed him! Do it!

1015
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,080
Feed him. Pour it. Come on!

1016
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,720
Is he drinking it?

1017
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,360
Don't pour it all

1018
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,600
He is spitting it again

1019
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:58,040
Feed him

1020
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,520
Pour carefully. Easy. Easy...

1021
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:01,640
Careful. Careful

1022
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,520
Careful. Careful

1023
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:04,800
Phew!

1024
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,280
What if something happens to him?

1025
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,600
Check his heartbeat

1026
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,680
- Is he safe? 
- No problem

1027
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:10,120
- Let's go check that police! 
- Come on!

1028
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:12,480
- Let's go check that police! 
- Come on!

1029
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:19,600
Hello

1030
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,560
What happened?

1031
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,080
David is no more

1032
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,760
I have the hard disk 
carrying the evidences

1033
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:25,240
You have nothing to worry

1034
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,480
You have nothing to worry

1035
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,800
That bow?

1036
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,720
What is it, Prasad?

1037
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:32,440
So you found who 
is behind all this

1038
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,800
So you found who 
is behind all this

1039
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:37,040
Brindha

1040
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:37,840
What are you gonna do about it?

1041
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,160
What are you gonna do about it?

1042
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,040
I have warned her and 
asked her to go abroad

1043
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,720
I took away all her 
gadgets and laptop

1044
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:43,040
She cannot contact anybody

1045
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,680
She cannot contact anybody

1046
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Did you ensure it?

1047
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,080
What if she has another copy?

1048
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:49,720
No way...

1049
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,280
I checked thoroughly

1050
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,000
This doesn't feel right

1051
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,840
Sir, she won't be a 
hindrance to you

1052
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,440
If any problem arises...

1053
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,400
Then I won't care about Brindha

1054
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:02,440
I'll send her off to 
where I sent David

1055
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,680
Roshan...

1056
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,440
Where are you guys?

1057
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,480
Roshan, open the door

1058
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,320
Roshan!

1059
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,080
This was totally unnecessary

1060
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:35,880
How will I face my 
parents and sister?

1061
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,960
How will I face my 
parents and sister?

1062
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:40,360
They will carry long faces 
till the marriage is over

1063
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:02,800
At times the truth is worse 
than the imagination

1064
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:04,240
But on that day...

1065
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,240
it was literally hell for me

1066
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,080
Roshan!

1067
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:30,640
Murali!

1068
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:33,640
Somebody open the door!

1069
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,840
Open the door guys!

1070
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:45,520
Roshan!

1071
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:46,720
Murali!

1072
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:50,960
Joy!

1073
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,280
Murali!

1074
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,400
Where are you guys?

1075
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,920
Roshan!

1076
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,200
Where are you guys?

1077
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:26,920
Open the door!

1078
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,480
Roshan!

1079
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:37,960
Guys! I'm scared!

1080
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:46,960
Where are you guys?

1081
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:57,640
Who's doing all this?!

1082
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:29,360
What happened?

1083
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:32,600
Brindha madam is dead

1084
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:33,680
What do you mean?

1085
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,000
- Yes! 
- But how?

1086
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,760
I don't know

1087
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:39,560
When I woke up, I saw her 
corpse in the cupboard

1088
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,560
Buddy, listen. Don't worry. 
We'll handle this

1089
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,720
In the refrigerator...

1090
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,480
I saw a finger

1091
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,080
I wonder whose finger is it

1092
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,680
Where are the guys?

1093
01:03:00,520 --> 01:03:02,320
- Where are the guys? 
- Don't know

1094
01:03:02,600 --> 01:03:04,520
I looked all over the 
house, in every room

1095
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,520
Didn't you see them?

1096
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,840
Where would I see them? I just 
got up after getting wasted!

1097
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:08,880
Then why did you get scared?

1098
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:09,880
Then why did you get scared?

1099
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,800
I didn't! You scared me!

1100
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:16,960
Come on, let's check what's happening

1101
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,400
- Listen 
- What?

1102
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,280
That police guy is 
lying dead over there

1103
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,760
If we step out...

1104
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:22,840
the police will catch us

1105
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,000
Did you kill him?

1106
01:03:24,280 --> 01:03:24,360
No. I didn't kill him

1107
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:25,840
No. I didn't kill him

1108
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,880
Then why are you scared?

1109
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,920
I'll handle it. First, 
we must escape from here

1110
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,400
- The door's locked 
- The main door?

1111
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,360
- Can't you open it from inside? 
- No

1112
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:39,640
Come on, I know where 
the spare key is

1113
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,920
This is why you shouldn't be roommates 
with Roshan. He is a mystery

1114
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:45,720
Whose finger could that be?

1115
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,120
Stop scaring me!

1116
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:52,520
It looks so gory!

1117
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,840
Told you!

1118
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,000
Hope you didn't touch and 
leave a finger print

1119
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,320
Don't worry

1120
01:03:58,600 --> 01:03:59,920
Damn! Who is behind all this?

1121
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,800
Stop pondering!

1122
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,880
Look here, where is the key?

1123
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,440
Let's escape from here first

1124
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,760
- Ok? 
- Ok

1125
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,520
What's going on in here?

1126
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:25,920
Told you

1127
01:04:30,920 --> 01:04:32,600
Quick! Get the keys

1128
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:40,840
Move!

1129
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:04,880
Siddiq!

1130
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:24,680
Siddiq

1131
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:25,200
Where are you going?

1132
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,360
Where are you going?

1133
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:32,200
Siddiq!

1134
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:32,920
Siddiq!

1135
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,200
Siddiq, open the door!

1136
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,600
Siddiq, open the door!

1137
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:45,520
Siddiq...

1138
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,720
Why are you doing this?

1139
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:49,600
I'm scared! Please!

1140
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,600
Open the door. Siddiq!

1141
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:04,040
Listen to me, Siddiq!

1142
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,560
Don't do this! Don't do it! 
Siddiq!

1143
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:09,880
Please! No! Don't do it! No!

1144
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:13,680
Please! No! Don't do it!

1145
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,800
Please! No! Don't do it!

1146
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:23,880
Siddiq!

1147
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,080
Siddiq, please don't do this!

1148
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:30,200
Aiyo!

1149
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:37,680
What will I tell your family?

1150
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,520
Siddiq!

1151
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:57,040
Damn it, I couldn't save you!

1152
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:59,800
Why? Why did you do this?

1153
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,000
You just killed yourself 
in front of me!

1154
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:28,000
Who is it?

1155
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,200
What do you want?

1156
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,120
- What have you done? 
- Buddy...

1157
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,400
I didn't do anything

1158
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,520
Why did you kill those two?

1159
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,360
I didn't

1160
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:53,440
Don't you lie!

1161
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:55,960
You murdered two people. 
You are drugged

1162
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:57,600
I sniffed it up by mistake

1163
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:01,200
You are getting married tomorrow 
and you murdered two people today

1164
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,800
You have ruined our lives 
too along with yours

1165
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,440
Look at the rooms

1166
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,160
Look how Roshan has kept it

1167
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:08,600
He must have murdered

1168
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:11,360
These are antiques from his 
dads and grandfather's time

1169
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,080
I know him since childhood. 
He isn't such a guy

1170
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,120
Were you here to kill everyone?

1171
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:19,320
How can you do this with you 
wedding scheduled for tomorrow?

1172
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:22,160
Did you think about your parents?

1173
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,920
What about the bride? Did 
you think about her?

1174
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,960
Why have you ruined all our lives?

1175
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:17,120
What's all this?

1176
01:10:17,440 --> 01:10:18,360
Drugs

1177
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,680
Roshan is doing 
some illegal work

1178
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,880
Then why did Siddiq hang himself?

1179
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:29,800
I don't know

1180
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:35,680
But there is some link between 
these drugs and his death

1181
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,760
Only if we find Roshan...

1182
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:42,200
we'll get an answer for all this

1183
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,960
What if Roshan murders us too?

1184
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,800
We must escape from 
here before he arrives

1185
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,120
We must somehow handover 
this drugs to the police

1186
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,480
No! They won't believe us

1187
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,600
Narcotic Commissioner is the 
one who will handle this

1188
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,520
And you have murdered 
his girlfriend

1189
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:03,640
Fine!

1190
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:05,360
Roshan murdered her

1191
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,840
What if, in anger,the commissioner 
frames us for everything?

1192
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,920
Our lives will be ruined

1193
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,840
Now, what do we do?

1194
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,240
So you're the one who took 
the key from the door lock?

1195
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:20,640
If you try to understand the 
mysteries happening here...

1196
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,840
If you try to understand the 
mysteries happening here...

1197
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:25,120
then it'll confuse you even more

1198
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:30,480
First, let's take 
these drugs and leave

1199
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,680
First, let's take 
these drugs and leave

1200
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:00,840
Murali!

1201
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,080
Aiy-aiyo!

1202
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,360
She is missing!

1203
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:17,760
Let's escape from here first! 
We don't need all this

1204
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:21,520
What?

1205
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,000
Si...Siddiq...

1206
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,200
that's were he died

1207
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:26,520
What do you mean?

1208
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:29,080
The door is open!

1209
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,720
- The door is open 
- Yes

1210
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:46,320
What's this?

1211
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:35,080
Shut the door! Close it!

1212
01:13:35,240 --> 01:13:35,960
Hold it! Close it!

1213
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:37,000
Hold it stronger!

1214
01:13:37,160 --> 01:13:37,200
- Pull it! Pull! Pull! 
- Open the door!

1215
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,800
- Pull it! Pull! Pull! 
- Open the door!

1216
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,920
Don't let him come out!

1217
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,360
- Open the door! 
- Close it!

1218
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:43,560
Karthik, open the door!

1219
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:44,480
Karthik, open the door!

1220
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,960
Don't let him come out! Hold it, 
I shall lock it with the key

1221
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:47,840
Hold it tight!

1222
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,680
Karthik! Karthik!

1223
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:54,560
Open..Open it!

1224
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:57,760
Hold it tighter! Keep holding it!

1225
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,720
Open it!

1226
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,320
Open it! Open! Open!

1227
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:03,480
Karthik!

1228
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:05,240
I said, open it!

1229
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,680
- Open! 
- Put it in this

1230
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,240
Open the door!

1231
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:18,840
Karthik!

1232
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,080
Karthik, open the door!

1233
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,120
Open the door

1234
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,960
My 'customary' holy rope

1235
01:14:31,960 --> 01:14:33,120
Damn it! Let's leave!

1236
01:14:33,480 --> 01:14:35,560
Mom will consider it as bad 
omen if I go without it

1237
01:14:35,560 --> 01:14:36,200
Please

1238
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,240
Not even sure if your marriage will take place 
tomorrow and you're talking about bad omen?

1239
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:40,560
Please, two minutes

1240
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:42,600
- I'll go look for it quickly 
- Quick! Make it fast!

1241
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,080
If I step out....

1242
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,080
Make it fast!

1243
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,200
I said, open the door!

1244
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:14,720
Who is it?

1245
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:35,080
Oh my God!

1246
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:37,880
Who is it?

1247
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:40,800
What is it?

1248
01:15:41,080 --> 01:15:43,360
- It's my father 
- Aiyo

1249
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:46,840
Come, let's go

1250
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,160
He'll murder us. Come on!

1251
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:49,680
My dad's at the door. 
How can we go?

1252
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,600
My dad's at the door. 
How can we go?

1253
01:16:10,240 --> 01:16:11,240
Come on!

1254
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:20,120
Roshan!

1255
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:21,800
No! Please!

1256
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:27,840
Push him away. Let's 
escape from here

1257
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:33,280
Stop fighting guys

1258
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,440
No! Please don't do this!

1259
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,400
Karthik, just leave him. 
Let's go

1260
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:42,680
Karthik, let him go

1261
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:44,240
Karthik, let him go

1262
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:53,840
Guys stop it before something 
really bad happens

1263
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,120
Karthik, push him away! 
Let's escape from here

1264
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:20,120
No! Please, stop it!

1265
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:22,560
Guys, stop fighting!

1266
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,240
Stop it! Stop it!

1267
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,800
Please, stop it

1268
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,960
Karthi, no! No!

1269
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:52,760
Roshan!

1270
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,000
Why?

1271
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,520
What was my fault?

1272
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,160
Why did you do this? Answer me!

1273
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,360
You have committed a blunder

1274
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,000
I thought you were a smart fellow

1275
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:22,320
Hence, I handled you the responsibility 
trusting you'd get things done properly

1276
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,720
Hence, I handled you the responsibility 
trusting you'd get things done properly

1277
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,160
I don't trust people so easy

1278
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:30,320
I trusted you

1279
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,360
Why?

1280
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,080
Because you're a drug addict

1281
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,200
You know the value 
of these drugs

1282
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,160
I told you repeatedly!

1283
01:20:39,080 --> 01:20:40,880
Don't bring your friends 
over to your home

1284
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,080
This is a highly confidential matter

1285
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:43,920
Now look!

1286
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,040
How many people we had to murder!

1287
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:55,320
You have also done big mistake

1288
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:57,680
Making a mistake is quite natural

1289
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:00,480
But you have committed 
big blunders

1290
01:21:00,960 --> 01:21:01,720
#1

1291
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:06,120
You shouldn't have come to your friend's house 
when you are getting married the next day

1292
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,040
But you came anyway

1293
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,000
#2

1294
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:11,440
You shouldn't have done 
drugs with your friends

1295
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:12,600
But you did it anyway

1296
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,480
#3

1297
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:15,640
You shouldn't have played James Bond

1298
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:16,920
You played it anyway

1299
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:18,160
#4

1300
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:21,080
You shouldn't have got angry!

1301
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:22,160
But you got anyway

1302
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,840
There is a place to show your anger

1303
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,480
Show your anger at 
home and that's fine

1304
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,960
Show your anger at work 
place and that's fine

1305
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,960
Show your anger at friends 
and that's fine too

1306
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,120
But with your enemy...

1307
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:34,120
you must show your anger carefully

1308
01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:35,320
Or else you'll suffer

1309
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,520
You'll suffer a lot!

1310
01:22:01,720 --> 01:22:03,120
You did what I ordered you to do

1311
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,200
But you should have done 
it without getting caught

1312
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:07,320
Ok

1313
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,080
You got caught

1314
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,760
Do we...

1315
01:22:14,160 --> 01:22:15,800
have something like, Plan B?

1316
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:17,520
No sir

1317
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:21,640
Never say 'No' or 'Cannot'

1318
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,960
Turn negative into positive

1319
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:26,000
Tell me, what shall we do with him?

1320
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:45,840
Shall we finish him off?

1321
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:47,360
Finish him off?

1322
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:47,960
Finish him off?

1323
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,000
How about him?

1324
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,200
Let's kill him and frame 
him for this murder. What do you say?

1325
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:56,680
Murdering is easy

1326
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,800
But framing is the difficult part

1327
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:15,000
Sir!

1328
01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:17,640
Karthi, what's happening?

1329
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:19,400
Drop the gun, sir

1330
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,720
Or else I'll shoot you!

1331
01:23:23,280 --> 01:23:24,480
Don't you play smart!

1332
01:23:24,520 --> 01:23:26,360
Roshan, this for you too

1333
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,320
Sir, listen to me!

1334
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,560
I know you are not used to it! 
But you must obey me now!

1335
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,080
Because I have a gun!

1336
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,600
Do you even know how to 
shoot using that gun?

1337
01:23:42,040 --> 01:23:43,840
Sir, don't talk unnecessarily

1338
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:45,440
Don't provoke me

1339
01:23:45,720 --> 01:23:47,880
Listen to me or else I'll shoot you!

1340
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:02,440
James bond #2!

1341
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,680
Five packets are missing

1342
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,960
Idiot! Idiot!

1343
01:24:26,720 --> 01:24:28,320
Go, search inside! Go!

1344
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:28,840
Do you know it's worth?

1345
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:29,800
Do you know it's worth?

1346
01:24:30,480 --> 01:24:30,520
Go! Search!

1347
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:31,760
Go! Search!

1348
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:40,560
Sir...

1349
01:24:40,920 --> 01:24:42,040
- What? 
- It's not there

1350
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:43,080
It's not there

1351
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:45,160
- I checked 
- Did you check thoroughly?

1352
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:47,000
- I checked everywhere 
- Thoroughly?

1353
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:48,880
It's not to be found anywhere

1354
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:49,400
Hold this!

1355
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,760
Where are the drugs? Answer me!

1356
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,680
Where did you hide it?

1357
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:00,240
I don't know, sir

1358
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:01,360
I didn't take it

1359
01:25:01,360 --> 01:25:02,240
I didn't take it

1360
01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:04,320
- You didn't take it? 
- No sir

1361
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:07,640
Sir, please let him go. He 
is getting married tomorrow

1362
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:08,120
Listen...

1363
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:14,160
Answer me!

1364
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,360
Sir, I promise that I don't know

1365
01:25:16,760 --> 01:25:19,440
Why are you torturing 
me unnecessarily?

1366
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,200
Do you know how 
much worth is it?

1367
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:25,120
Do you know?

1368
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:28,240
If you don't say it then all your 
family and friends will be dead!

1369
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:31,240
You! I don't know! Told 
you, I don't know!

1370
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:36,800
Sir, please no!

1371
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:39,240
Please don't hurt him, sir

1372
01:25:39,360 --> 01:25:40,280
Die!

1373
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,200
Please spare his life!

1374
01:25:41,240 --> 01:25:42,200
Please sir, poor fellow

1375
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,160
Give me that

1376
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,720
Where are the drugs?

1377
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:57,360
Sir?

1378
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:01,560
Sir!

1379
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:02,920
Sir!

1380
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:05,320
Sir! Sir!

1381
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:12,760
How can you doubt me?

1382
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:14,600
I murdered Brindha 
on your orders

1383
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:16,600
And murdered the 
constable who saw it

1384
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,680
I tried the new drug on Siddiq

1385
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:21,880
The over dosage made 
him commit suicide

1386
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,800
The over dosage made 
him commit suicide

1387
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:25,960
I did all of this for you

1388
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,880
I murdered people for you

1389
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:28,320
Why would I steal your drugs?

1390
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,960
Why would I steal your drugs?

1391
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:31,680
I am your slave, sir

1392
01:26:39,680 --> 01:26:41,040
Sir, it's him!

1393
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,440
It's him!

1394
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,400
I'm sure he would 
have taken your drugs

1395
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,320
He consumed drugs without caring that 
he is gonna get married tomorrow

1396
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,400
He might have liked 
and stolen it

1397
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:56,160
Sir...

1398
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,520
please no! He wouldn't 
have stole it

1399
01:26:59,600 --> 01:26:59,640
I don't know

1400
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,120
I don't know

1401
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:01,360
If you don't speak up...

1402
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,760
- I'll shoot you 
- I don't know

1403
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:03,880
I don't know

1404
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,280
I don't know! I don't know!

1405
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:19,560
Sir! Sir!

1406
01:29:43,800 --> 01:29:45,600
Kathi...

1407
01:29:46,160 --> 01:29:46,640
Murali

1408
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,080
Nothing to worry

1409
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,680
Murali, nothing to worry

1410
01:29:53,240 --> 01:29:53,760
Murali?

1411
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:58,240
Let's go to a hospital. Don't worry

1412
01:29:58,240 --> 01:29:59,880
Come, let's go

1413
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:03,640
Murali?!

1414
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:05,520
Murali!

1415
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:08,560
Murali? Oh my God!

1416
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:40,680
Told you, don't yell!

1417
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,520
Sorry dude

1418
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:45,880
What is it, sir?

1419
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:46,520
Sir...

1420
01:32:46,960 --> 01:32:48,640
I need water to take my medicines

1421
01:32:48,640 --> 01:32:49,120
Ok

1422
01:32:49,640 --> 01:32:50,160
Come in

1423
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:28,840
Karthik

1424
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:00,800
Sir!

1425
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:04,480
Sir, he rushed out, dashed 
on me and fell unconscious

1426
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:26,200
Brindha...

1427
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:27,400
Brindha!

1428
01:37:28,280 --> 01:37:30,400
- Hey Karthik! 
- What happened?

1429
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:32,480
What happened? Lift him! 
Lift him!

1430
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:33,680
Wait, sir has asked to...

1431
01:37:33,680 --> 01:37:34,960
Lift him. Lift him

1432
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:36,560
- Quick! 
- Get inside

1433
01:38:38,640 --> 01:38:42,440
It took long time for me to 
realize what happened on that day

1434
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:47,760
That red powder. When I sniffed it up, 
first everything appeared different

1435
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:48,320
Initially the trip was happy

1436
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,880
Initially the trip was happy

1437
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:54,560
But slowly my brain started 
telling me lot of things

1438
01:39:03,160 --> 01:39:03,640
What?

1439
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:08,640
- Dad? 
- Dear?

1440
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,040
What happened?

1441
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:12,520
What happened, dad?

1442
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:14,160
- What happened? 
- Tell us, dad

1443
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,000
Please tell us, dad

1444
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:18,920
Karthik...

1445
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:20,240
committed a murder it seems

1446
01:39:20,240 --> 01:39:21,920
committed a murder it seems

1447
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:43,840
I couldn't differentiate between 
the reality and imagination

1448
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:46,720
I started imagining 
things to be real

1449
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:48,920
Night started appearing to be day

1450
01:39:48,920 --> 01:39:51,600
I started imagining all my closed 
ones die one after the other

1451
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:54,920
The guilt of consuming the 
drugs affected me a lot

1452
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:58,680
It showed me everything 
and everyone as my enemy

1453
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:02,160
I accidentally murdered that 
lady who wanted my help

1454
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,080
My parents didn't visit me at all

1455
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:37,120
I understand their anger on me

1456
01:40:37,640 --> 01:40:40,800
Janani? She definitely 
won't forgive me

1457
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:44,160
Yet, I'm sure I'll convince her

1458
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:46,840
She will trust me blindly

1459
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,440
She will definitely take me back

1460
01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:58,600
Where did Joy go?

1461
01:40:59,200 --> 01:40:59,240
He is in abroad

1462
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:00,560
He is in abroad

1463
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,000
Why didn't Ramesh visit me?

1464
01:41:06,080 --> 01:41:07,800
Is he still upset with me?

1465
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:08,760
No idea, dude

1466
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:10,920
After that night, he isn't 
in touch with any of us

1467
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:13,160
Did anyone go to my home?

1468
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,400
I went to your home

1469
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:17,880
Your father asked us not 
visit your home ever again

1470
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,240
Ever since we never 
went to your house

1471
01:41:45,120 --> 01:41:48,360
We all were worried and rushed 
to the hospital to see you

1472
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,800
We couldn't see you 
in that condition

1473
01:41:51,840 --> 01:41:53,880
You too were not in a 
condition to meet us

1474
01:41:54,760 --> 01:41:58,080
Dad and Janani's 
father had a big spat

1475
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:00,280
Dad was heart broken

1476
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:03,200
Mom said he felt lonely and isolated

1477
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:07,240
Poor Janani

1478
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:08,040
Karthik...

1479
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,720
my uncle owns a software 
company in Delhi

1480
01:42:11,240 --> 01:42:12,400
I already spoke to him

1481
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:14,400
Work there for few days

1482
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:16,440
Then we'll see what to do next

1483
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:18,840
He is right

1484
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:21,960
If you stay here, old 
memories will haunt you

1485
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:30,600
Let me go after a week

1486
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:40,360
- No, it's ok. Please 
- Have it

1487
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:48,840
Dear sister...

1488
01:42:49,200 --> 01:42:50,680
can't I meet our parents?

1489
01:42:50,960 --> 01:42:53,160
Go to Delhi and come 
back as our old Karthik

1490
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,440
We shall all get back 
and live together

1491
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,000
Yes?

1492
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,600
Janani?

1493
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:12,480
And you are?

1494
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,880
Ok dear. Ok

1495
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:27,640
Come on. Come on

1496
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:28,640
It's ok dear. Don't cry

1497
01:43:28,640 --> 01:43:31,080
It's ok dear. Don't cry

1498
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:40,240
Thank you

1499
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:41,840
Where do you work?

1500
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:44,400
Only four days ago I was 
released from the prison

1501
01:43:49,800 --> 01:43:52,520
Look here, dear. Look at the cartoon. 
Look here

1502
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:56,920
How are uncle and aunty?

1503
01:43:58,400 --> 01:43:59,120
They are fine

1504
01:44:02,040 --> 01:44:02,560
Grandma?

1505
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:07,320
She died six months later 
from the time you had met her

1506
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:13,400
Is drugs more important 
than all of us?

1507
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:19,160
We don't even meet each other

1508
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:24,240
So far that has been the case

1509
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:29,600
Only Gayathri talks to 
me every now and then

1510
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:33,200
Just one day...

1511
01:44:35,800 --> 01:44:38,400
That one day made me cry for a whole year

1512
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,960
Only when I go home...

1513
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,440
I'm reminded of you

1514
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:51,720
Now, I have totally 
forgotten you and moved on

1515
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:01,440
Sorry

1516
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:02,960
Forgive me

1517
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,440
Karthi! What happened?

1518
01:45:07,480 --> 01:45:08,560
Why are you crying?

1519
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,440
- Dude, don't worry everything will be fine 
- Everything will be fine

1520
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:12,800
Come on

1521
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,800
Don't cry. It's alright

1522
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:16,680
Please don't cry. We 
are there for you

1523
01:45:17,120 --> 01:45:18,720
Please tell him not to cry

1524
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:20,920
Sorry dude

1525
01:45:20,920 --> 01:45:22,440
Don't feel bad. Come on

1526
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:25,520
Control yourself

1527
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,840
Please calm down!

1528
01:45:36,480 --> 01:45:37,640
Sorry buddy

1529
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,080
What is it?

1530
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:08,400
Karthik is missing

1531
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,800
Did you marry off all your sisters?

1532
01:46:18,720 --> 01:46:19,840
Yes. In a grand way

1533
01:46:20,920 --> 01:46:22,640
All three sisters are 
married and settled

1534
01:46:23,560 --> 01:46:24,920
Third sister...

1535
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:26,560
had an arranged marriage

1536
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:27,160
The groom's family was 
quite troublesome

1537
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,800
The groom's family was 
quite troublesome

1538
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,240
Demanding money and dowry

1539
01:46:30,680 --> 01:46:32,960
Thankfully it was your sister, 
Gayatri who helped me with money

1540
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:33,920
She is fine now

1541
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,320
All three of them are fine. Everyone's fine

1542
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:37,440
I am doing good

1543
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:40,640
But...

1544
01:46:41,680 --> 01:46:41,720
not you

1545
01:46:41,720 --> 01:46:42,560
not you

1546
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:45,640
Forget it. Let's not talk about it

1547
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:49,960
All our friends visited me 
but why didn't you come, visit me?

1548
01:46:51,480 --> 01:46:52,000
Buddy...

1549
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,120
I betrayed you

1550
01:46:54,720 --> 01:46:55,800
What did you do?

1551
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:56,160
I crossed the limits and 
ended up ruining my own life

1552
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:59,800
I crossed the limits and 
ended up ruining my own life

1553
01:46:59,920 --> 01:47:01,400
You didn't kill anyone

1554
01:47:05,120 --> 01:47:07,200
After Prem and myself 
left after having a spat

1555
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:09,600
We left and I went out and drank a lot

1556
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:13,360
Since you didn't take my side, 
my anger was aggravated

1557
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:17,000
I returned back to Roshan's apartment 
in a rage to fight with you all

1558
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,400
Prasad...

1559
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,320
Prasad

1560
01:48:00,280 --> 01:48:00,760
Sir!

1561
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,680
Sir! Sir!

1562
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,400
Sir, please sir!

1563
01:48:06,360 --> 01:48:07,000
Look here...

1564
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:09,400
I have committed two 
murders since morning

1565
01:48:10,040 --> 01:48:12,040
I don't want to 
commit another one

1566
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:14,560
Sir, please spare my life 
and I won't tell anyone

1567
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:17,360
Sir, my family is dependent on me. 
I have three sisters

1568
01:48:18,080 --> 01:48:19,360
Sir, please sir. Please

1569
01:48:23,200 --> 01:48:25,280
If this news leaks...

1570
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:27,600
I won't harm you but...

1571
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:30,360
- your three sisters... 
- No sir

1572
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:32,600
I swear, I won't tell anyone. 
Please let me go

1573
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:33,480
I'll leave

1574
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:34,080
- Don't even turn back! Go! 
- Ok sir

1575
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:35,880
- Don't even turn back! Go! 
- Ok sir

1576
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:40,920
I didn't know what 
to do at that moment

1577
01:48:41,560 --> 01:48:45,120
I didn't want my sisters to face 
any problems from the commissioner

1578
01:48:45,920 --> 01:48:49,960
I had to choose between being a good 
friend to you or a good brother

1579
01:48:50,520 --> 01:48:52,160
I was forced to make a selfish decision

1580
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:54,560
I was pushed to betray you

1581
01:48:54,960 --> 01:48:56,160
Forgive me

1582
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:58,560
I am the one behind 
everything that happened

1583
01:49:08,280 --> 01:49:09,560
Listen! Buddy!

1584
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:32,520
Welcome, sir

1585
01:49:32,680 --> 01:49:33,720
We need to check your bar

1586
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,560
We have got an information 
that Cocaine is sold here

1587
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:38,440
We are selling it 
illegally on your orders

1588
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:40,360
We agreed to pay you 
30% cut from it

1589
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:40,480
Then why raid us?

1590
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,000
Then why raid us?

1591
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:47,720
Search!

1592
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,720
A pot full of monkey's 
favorite fruits

1593
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:35,360
The pot hole is same size 
as that of monkey's hand

1594
01:52:36,080 --> 01:52:39,200
In greed, the monkey puts 
its hand inside the pot

1595
01:52:39,480 --> 01:52:41,880
It holds the fruit and 
tries to take it out

1596
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,000
But it couldn't

1597
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:45,040
Drug addiction is quite similar

1598
01:52:45,400 --> 01:52:49,240
The stupid monkey doesn't realize that if it 
let goes of the fruit, it can release itself

1599
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,600
Drug addicts are similar to that monkey

1600
01:53:04,400 --> 01:53:10,600
That moment, I didn't feel it was a blunder 
and sniffed that drug and that ruined my life

1601
01:53:28,680 --> 01:53:32,320
I lost my loved one and you 
are the reason behind it

1602
01:53:32,520 --> 01:53:35,240
The drugs that you sell illegally

1603
01:53:39,600 --> 01:53:43,880
It's your duty to prevent people from drugs 
but you allow it in the greed of money and that...

1604
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:46,480
has ruined the lives of many like me

1605
01:53:49,800 --> 01:53:53,640
What I did was also a mistake 
but I got my punishment already

1606
01:53:53,680 --> 01:53:56,680
But only few good people 
like Brindha exist here

1607
01:53:56,920 --> 01:53:59,440
You wanted to finish them 
off and live happily

1608
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:02,400
Hence you must be punished!
