it will come next month...

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:41,340

will not come again, right?

...you said Upma, my mood is out.

51
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,070
I am going to eat in canteen

00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,180
You like outside junk food, 
but not home made food?

00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,520

58
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,430
...she is getting spoiled by you

59
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,060
What did I do? 
Han...

60
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,780
...keep money in the pocket for her...

61
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,400
...open the door when 
she comes at odd hours...

62
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,640
...and dance to her tunes... 
Why?

63
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,000
First and foremost, I don't give her money

64
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,460
How? 
- She takes it herself

65
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,940
Second, true I open 
the door for her at night...

66
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,770
...so as not to disturb you

67
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,540
Third, it is you who dance and 
make me dance...

68
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,810
...you are the dancer, I am only a doctor

69
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,530
Anju, with whose permission did 
you apply for Bangalore college?

70
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,040
Why, is there no college 
in our Theerthalli?

71
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:47,480
I want to study Architecture 
and not BA or B.Sc.

72
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,750
What? Brother, 
Architecture is 5 years course...

73
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,690
Uncle, you know where I got the seat?

74
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,010

77
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,370

in this big house...

78
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,520
...how can we live without 
you for 4 to 5 years?

79
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,030
You join college here itself

80
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,380
Mom, please...

81
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:12,320
Don't be stubborn Anjali

82
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,080
No further talks on this. 
As eldest of the house I am telling...

83
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:18,870
...we will not send Anjali anywhere

84
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,950
Why are you not sending?

85
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
Why not?

86
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:29,150
Anjali is going to Bangalore for 
studies. Let her go & study...

87
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:32,560
Earlier you got her 
everything that she wanted...

88
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:35,750
...but now you don't want her 
to go there and study?

89
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,790
Children should be brought up with love,

90
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,220
but the love should not be torture,

91
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,310
got it?

92
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:46,700
I will handle these people, 
you go ahead with your studies

93
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,060

94
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,250

As I want to stay in Bangalore hostel &

Early morning they would put off the fan 
and wake me up...

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,940
...were forcefully making me eat...

194
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,860

and what has to be done...

195
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:39,390

196
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:44,760
I don't want anyone here. 
I can be flying like a free bird here!

Oh, madam, it is you!?...

202
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,100

When others in class made I L T, 
I made R for you,

209
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,420

00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,050
Bro, it's she who started the fight, 
I didn't do anything

356
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,020
being a Senoir I am telling you 
just go back to your class that's it

357
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,200
go now

358
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,650
how many subjects did you fail?

359
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,170
Listen, don't ever ask a girl's age 
nor an Engineering Student's Back log

360
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,780
I have heard these Dialouges many times 
you tell me

361
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,000
four subjects...

362
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,030
four...! the other day 
you said six I think!

363
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,150
Two absent...

364
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,100
Two subjects Absent 
-hu...hu...

365
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,160
Look, Studies are the basics of life

366
00:24:55,250 --> 00:24:57,660
keeping it aside we should do Magic

367
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,430
and that is my life's Logic

368
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,180
Dear Students...

369
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,040
elections for student President will be 
conducted in our College this year too

370
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,860
though we Lecturers 
are very friendly with you

371
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,020
we can't express certain issues with you...

372
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,440
and even you too can't 
express certain issue with us

373
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,000
at that time, a leader 
will be of utmost importance

374
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,500
you can file the nominations

375
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:24,870
coming Friday will be 
the last day for filing nominations

376
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,270
I wish you all the best, Good luck..

377
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:38,600
Uuh, God bless you 
-Namaste Sir

378
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:39,630
Namaste Sir

379
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,580
then, Yuvaraj how are you?

380
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:44,780
Election dates have been announced 
I will file nominations tomorrow

381
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,500

382
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,970
my blessing are always on you

383
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,950
like always, even this year you will win

384
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,690
Shivraj,arrange whatever he needs

385
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,550
Sir, why waste time 
in the pretext of elections

386
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,680
unanimously elect Yuvaraj as President

387
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,770
you can save both Money and time Sir

388
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,070
Ooh, we are aware I say, that 
none will come forward to contest...

389
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,200
but we have to follow the rules

390
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,540
now, you file your nomination

391
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
Guys...guys...Side please...

392
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,270
come on, side please...

393
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,060
hey Nandu, you should 
have come a little early

394
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,510
he just filed the nomination now

395
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,650
I have come here to stand too

396
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,850
then, are you sitting now!?

397
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
to file my nomination

398
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,790
you are contesting the elections!?

399
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,840
when waste and trash 
have contested why not me !?

400
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,400
Umm

401
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
then, are you a broom!?

402
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,800
no, I am a vacuum cleaner

403
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,870
both sweep the dust and wate

404
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,740
Boys don't dare to contest opposite me

405
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,860
you being a girl, can't bother me, go now

406
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,420
just look back at the History

407
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,820
when Gods couldn't slay Demons

408
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,820
it was the Goddesses 
who slayed them very easily

409
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,490
History repeats Dude

410
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,020
stand at ease

411
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,750

412
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:20,740

413
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,430
yes Sir

414
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:26,970
Jai Hind

415
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:28,260
sorry Sir

416
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:28,910
one round

417
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,610
Please, sorry will not 
repeat this mistake again

418
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,400
two rounds

419
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,190
Sir, sorry

420
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,150
three rounds and kneel down

421
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,960
Sir, pleae...sorry... 
-move

422
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,630
N C C...

423
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,190
National Cadet Corps...

424
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,920
with a motto "Unity and discipline"

425
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,470
Unity and Discipline got it

426
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:49,210
the main aim of N C C is...

427
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,670
to produce soldiers for 
the Country and its safety

428
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:54,920
Run

429
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,210
N C C is called as a Second Army

430
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,190
learn whatever is taught 
to you with dedication...

431
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,770
and move ahead towards your AIM

432
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,750
understood? 
-yes Sir

433
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,950
understood? 
-yes Sir

434
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:08,260
understood? 
-yes Sir

435
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
oh...no....

436
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,400
why did he come now!?

437
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,050
Anjali

438
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,390
punishment

439
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,600
the first point in N C C is timesense

440
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,090
okay...

441
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,700
anyways it's already late

442
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:31,180
instead of getting reprimanded

443
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,510
you should have commonsense 
atleast to sleep a little more

444
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,380
but, you don't have both of them

445
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,120
can we catch up in canteen later?

446
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:45,750
Umm...okay...

447
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,470
Umm...okay...

448
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,350
see you then

449
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,650
Ohh...che...

450
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,550
you have filed the nomination in style

451
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,250
you know we need money for Campaign

452
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,360
yeah Nandu

453
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:06,460
once you decide to fight a war

454
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,090
you shouldn't count the heads 
which are before you

455
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,450
once you contest an election

456
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,300
you shouldn't think about the expenditure

457
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,270
we need money right!?

458
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:18,070
I have a plan...

459
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,370
100 rupees for a hug

460
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,300
I haven't seen such strategy anywhere

461
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,120
I have seen people vote by taking money

462
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,010
this is the first time I see 
people give money and vote

463
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,260
anyways this is a good offer

464
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,510
come, come on...

465
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,080
give me, move on...

466
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:55,750
move on guys, hurry up

467
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,200
this is cheating, 
this is very little for 100 rupees

468
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,010
go... 
-hey...

469
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,570
come on, come on, make it fast

470
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,030
hey, move back

471
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:13,730
hey, move back

472
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,210
dude, I will pay you 100 rupees 
let me stand here

473
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,360
even I have paid 
200 rupees to stand here, go back

474
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,410
thank you

475
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:20,850
guys, fall in line

476
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,120
you fatty... 
-oh...!

477
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,600
he pushed me, what shall I do?

478
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,710
dude, it's not me

479
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,750
1 Hug = 500 Rupees

480
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,610
dude, which branch!?

481
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:38,280
S B I, Malleswaram branch 
-Oh...!

482
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,390
hey, aren't you ashamed 
to behave like this in our college...

483
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,450
wait let me teach you

484
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:44,460
Brother no... 
-Hello, Police station

485
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,450
Brother, please, take this 2000 rupees

486
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,490
move, get out now

487
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,270
if I see you again here, will kill you

488
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,100
this will suffice for four rounds

489
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,910
hey...

490
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,670

-Hai...

491
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:57,610
Sit...

492
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,140
thank you

493
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,190
how do you feel Bangalore?

494
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,760
it is pretty, 
I am getting accustomed to this place

495
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:07,700
on night out...

496
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:08,640
with your boy friend!?

497
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,400
Ahh...boy friend!?

498
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,170
no, no boyfriend right now

499
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,360
if my family comes to know about it 
they will take me back to my native

500
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,670
they will know 
only when you tell them right!?

501
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,420
if you don't, how will they know? 
-vote for Nandini

502
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,240

503
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:21,970

504
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,360

at home to make a boy/girl friend?

505
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,060
you have a girl friend!?

506
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,280
Uuh...girl friend...

507
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,890

508
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,920

545
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:06,710
Umm...no...

546
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,420
I would had asked you go 
for shopping at Bandra or Juhu...

547
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,780
I went my cousin...

548
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:16,240
Oh, you went with your cousin right 
-yes...

549
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:17,980
I could have still suggested some places 
-for shopping!?

550
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,990

-Varun

551
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:21,110

552
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:25,960
Aah...you always come here for shopping?

553
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,700
Haa we come here 
and go to other places too...

554
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:29,320
you know, depending on the mood

555
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:31,390
Hum...look there

556
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,540
Maya...

557
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:37,020
Maya ready, it's already 9.00

558
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:37,880
I am ready

559
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,380
but, your Daughter is not ready yet

560
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,700
coming 
-look she is ready too

561
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,650
listen, don't start scoulding 
once she comes down

562
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,780
do I look like a quarrel monger to you?

563
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,360
you are a quarrel phobic...

564
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:51,820
citing your quarrel nature 
she will go without breakfast...

565
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,450
okay...okay...I am here

566
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:57,190
instead of dying behind music all day

567
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,040
if you join aqua Aerobics or Zumba class

568
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:01,230
your health will improve

569
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,300
you physic will be good, you will be fit

570
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,510
yes, you will be very fit

571
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,390
you tell about Physic or physics...

572
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,850
or civics, chemistry

573
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:12,520
you tell her whatever you wnat 
she will not listen anything

574
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,290
why!?

575
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,390
Umm...!

576
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,310
hey..what is this?

577
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,820
Mom, Puliyogare is super

578
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,120
hey...it's not Puliyogare, 
it's Vangibath...che...

579
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,280
both are rice item, 
even the colours are same...

580
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,660
only the indegrients are different

581
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:35,390
dad, I made a mix yesterday night, 
you know how the feel was

582
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,940
Beautiful 
-Beautiful...

583
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,370
the whole night we couldn't sleep 
only Boom Boom Bang bang sound, right?

584
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:41,930
Umm...

585
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,500
Mom, why do you hate Music so much?

586
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:48,230
Maya, more than Music studies 
are very important in one's life...

587
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:48,900
correct

588
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,900
but, we can do both simultaniously

589
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,730
very correct

590
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,040
what you said is not correct

591
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:56,000
yes, even that is correct

592
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,840
Dad, this shirt doesn't suit you

593
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,510
why, because this doesn't have a pocket? 
-yes...

594
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,970
it's okay, don't worry, 
there are pockets for my pant

595
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:07,790
hey...hey...

596
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:08,890
thank you 
-what is this!?

597
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,850
hey... 
-Ummm...

598
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,810
your are spoiling her

599
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:17,430
when you are here to redeem her, 
that will balance everything

600
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,520
I will pay 
-No, I will pay this time

601
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:24,150
hey, some one pay and take it

602
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:59,150
I am in hurry and thrilled

603
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:11,050
my heart beats for the love 
which has blossomed inside without a hint

604
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:19,380
this smiling darling is a thief

605
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:29,410
a Prince who came into my life, 
this is a new feeling

606
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:39,410
this punishment is a wonder, 
but it's quite an amusement

607
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:44,730
dear if you are free...

608
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,760
will you meet me in my dream...

609
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,510
I will wait for you,

610
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:59,190
and this is my request to you

611
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:09,860
now a days the mirror says...

612
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:20,360
Oh teen you have changed offlate

613
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,930
Varun we will watch that Movie

614
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,640
let's see a kannada Movie

615
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:26,970
it will be really good

616
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,160
for anjali's sake 
we will all go for a kannada film

617
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,400
this love which has 
blossomed without notice

618
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,430
is the evidence of my dreams

619
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:09,600
when two hearts unite, 
it's only conversation between eyes

620
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,680
this unsung love is an intoxication

621
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,840
my heart beat gallops 
when your little finger touches mine...

622
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,800
...while we walk together

623
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:25,710
when you kiss hugging me tight in your arms

624
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,720
at that moment I feel, am all yours

625
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:45,870
Oh love,I want you to be mine ever

626
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:56,790
dear, don't give your heart to anyone

627
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,940
Uum..look there

628
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,790

-Hai

629
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,710

630
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,990
Hai... 
-Hai...

631
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:22,850
Haa... what enjoying bike ride 
with Varun in full swing?

632
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,340
no, I had gone shopping 
with his friends group

633
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,280
friends group... which friends!?

634
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,990
Akshay...Ved...Abhishek..Neha...Prakru...

635
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,470
Neha...!? 
-yes...

636
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,290
how did he introduce her to you?

637
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,240
he introduced her as friend

638
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
a Friend!? 
-yes...!

639
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,680
you don't know...

640
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,690
earlier they were in a relationship

641
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:42,600
relationship..?

642
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,290
just recently they broke up

643
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,600
why, didn't he tell you this?

644
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,010
Umm, no...

645
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,670
don't burst crackers during election

646
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,050
no sound and air pollution here

647
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,950
what, don't burst crackers!?

648
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:21,590
let the crackers be of others 
make sure we light the fire to burst it

649
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,480
until the end of this elections 
our boys will often come in and go out

650
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,320
hey, write down, 
in the headlines of Newspaper...

651
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,030
this college is mine, 
this college belongs to Nandu's

652
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:41,320
in future even 
if a dog wants to come in...

653
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,170
it has to come in with my permission

654
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,300
if it comes in without my permission...

655
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:54,130
election isn't easy, like walking down 
with a pair of bells on your feet...

656
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,110
two steps of an elephant, 
four steps of an Lion...

657
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,190
six steps of a Tiger...

658
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,240
eight steps of a Cheetah...

659
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,860
one step more 
above all these will be mine

660
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,800
but, you are not aware of our strength

661
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,850
until my arrival its other's trend

662
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:16,590
once I arrive... it wil be my trend

663
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,820
this entire college is our world

664
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,640
to whatever level you go, 
I will proceed one step ahead of you

665
00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:28,290
don't cast your vote to a person who does 
nothing except mouthing filmy dialouges

666
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,540
Ooh...

667
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,160
day dreaming... Illusion...!?

668
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,410
today's morning breakfast is so bad 
-Hai...

669
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,390
come let's go

670
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,270
God, he is so annoying

671
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,440
even I don't understand it...

672
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,980
Now you listen...

673
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:47,050
I just hate him 
-hey stop...

674
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:48,290
come on

675
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,610
Anjali what's happening?

676
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,490
hey, come here I need to talk to you

677
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,630
hey leave me 
-what is happening?

678
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:01,620
what is your relationship with Neha? 
-Oh...

679
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:04,270
that issue, who told you?

680
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,150
somebody told me, what bothers you...

681
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:07,460
is it true or false?

682
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:08,890
yes, true...

683
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,320
she was my girl friend

684
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,060
but, there was complications between us

685
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,050
and...

686
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,240
with mutual understanding 
we just broke up yaa

687
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:18,810
break up...

688
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,060
then, you both are not together anymore?

689
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,970
Anjali...

690
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:25,890

691
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:27,920

she is my ex

693
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,920
she is out of my life, it's over...

694
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:42,150
that's fine, 
what have you done to your hair?

695
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,620

696
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,490
he is busy in K G F 2

697
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,490

701
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:03,840

702
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,430
I have one in my mind

703
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:08,450
he is the right person

704
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,020
who!?

705
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,710
the entire Karnataka he has fans

706
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,870
neither his brain 
nor his tongue has filters

707
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:31,150
Fans of Hucchha Venkat

708
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:37,750
Hucchha Venkat, V for Huchhaa Venkat...

709
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,900
hai Venkat... 
-Brother Venkat speaks openly

710
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:44,180
Brother words are like bullets

711
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:47,350
when Brother enters 
the box office will blast

712
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:50,560
who has the guts of Venkat here 
-Oh god...!

713
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:55,990
where is the limit for Brother's Bravery

904
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:52,110
Nandu...

905
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,610
you said, he has begged opologies 
from you many times

906
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,230
what have you thought about him?

907
00:51:58,010 --> 00:51:59,880
Nandu, mistakes happen...

908
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,570
it's normal to make mistake

909
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:02,500
you mean!?

910
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:06,340
he has put behind his Ego 
and opoligised to you...

911
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,110
sort out this issue soon

912
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:11,370
you mean to say that 
what he did was right?

913
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:16,280
I am not saying that he was right, 
but, now even you are a election candidate

914
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,430
but, you slapping him was not right too

915
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,460
just think about it

916
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,720
You fought with Yuvaraj it seems, 
what was the need for it now?

917
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,620
Chikkoos, just tell where Yuvaraj is

918
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:03,240
if you ask the hen where the egg is 
it will show, how will a rooster show?

919
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,110
but the rooster knows where the hen is

920
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:09,770
he is a rooster too, 
go and see him in the Garage

921
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:11,490
Thankyou 
-Welcome...

922
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:14,360

923
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:16,580

925
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,080
it's was my mistake

926
00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:21,070
I shouldn't have crossed my limit

927
00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:22,340

928
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,110

00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:50,240
My hearts yearns for 
pampering and scouldings

935
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:57,530
shall I consent this crazy desire

936
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:05,270

937
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:19,150
shall I fall into the shoulders of Love

938
00:54:19,450 --> 00:54:24,200

939
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:29,940

940
00:54:30,110 --> 00:54:34,980

949
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:55,400
he is filled in the Air I breathe 
what shall I do

950
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,270
before I forget how will 
I stop myself from remembering him

951
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:05,910

952
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:11,440

1149
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,700
they were enjoying a Rave Party 
in the farm house near Judges Place Sir

1150
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:39,820

01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,580
their career will be spoilt

1156
01:10:52,480 --> 01:10:53,480

1157
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,530

01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,110

Mr. A C P my Daughter is not of that nature

01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,700
we know she had gone to the freshers party

1197
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:06,560

of our teen kids Sir

1199
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:16,060

where their kids are heading...

they took me on the pretext of Music party

1205
01:14:30,930 --> 01:14:32,230
I am innocent Sir

1206
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:33,250
Dad...

1207
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,960
Dad, I haven't done anything

1208
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:43,720
you know that your Dad 
is a respectable person

1209
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,060
you should strive to uphold his respect

1210
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:56,210
if your friend circle is bad

1211
01:14:57,150 --> 01:15:00,400
you will spoil your entire life

1212
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:01,840
be careful

1213
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:41,610

01:15:46,850 --> 01:15:48,350
Sujatha don't scould her now

1217
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,830

inside Police Station

1218
01:15:50,850 --> 01:15:52,100
please...please leave me...

1219
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:52,880
Maya...

1220
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:56,020
Maya...

1221
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:57,950
Maya

1222
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,160
Sujatha don't hurry

1223
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,750
let her relax a while

1224
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:02,900
let's talk later

1225
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,230
our teen Daughter 
spent a whole night at Police Station

1226
01:16:06,370 --> 01:16:07,200
aren't you worried!?

1227
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,570
and not everyone who goes 
to a Police Station is a criminal

1228
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,650
no one knows what happened there

1229
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:13,810
I know what is a rave party

1230
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,560
I even know what happens there too

1231
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:18,280
Drugs...Sex...Dance...

1232
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:19,780
che..che...I feel ashamed to talk about it

1233
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:22,590
we shouldn't doubt our child 
imagining some vague things

1234
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,850
let's talk leisurely, 
if she is wrong, let's correct her

1235
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:25,750
don't hurry

1236
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:26,860
Maya...

1237
01:16:27,700 --> 01:16:31,070
Maya...open the door

1238
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,740
Mom, why are you banging the door!?

1239
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,200
am I a criminal, 
or am I escaping somewhere?

1240
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:39,200
hey...hey... 
-you are saying the same thing non stop

1241
01:16:39,670 --> 01:16:41,420
true, I had gone to the party...

1242
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,210
but I haven't done anything unlawful Momn

1243
01:16:43,260 --> 01:16:44,600
don't be stupid you idiot...

1244
01:16:45,340 --> 01:16:47,260
no matter whether the slush falls on you 
or you fall on the slush...

1245
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:48,490
the scar remains in your life

1246
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,330
I haven't done anything 
which will remain a scar in my life

1247
01:16:50,370 --> 01:16:51,580
you can say it...

1248
01:16:51,950 --> 01:16:53,240
as a Mother I can listen

1249
01:16:53,420 --> 01:16:55,080
society will not listen to it

1250
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,480
the reason for all this is Music

1251
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:58,930

01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:01,270

1259
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,010

01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,300

1261
01:17:19,410 --> 01:17:21,290

Sujatha...

is of an impecunious Musician...

Mom...

1277
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:08,660
me and Uday studied in the same college

1278
01:18:10,510 --> 01:18:11,680
we were good friends...

1279
01:18:13,410 --> 01:18:14,410
our friendship turned to love...

1280
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,500
you were the result of our love...

1281
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:18,780
then later breakup...

1282
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:24,360
I wanted Uday and you...

1283
01:18:24,940 --> 01:18:25,940
I wanted to marry him

1284
01:18:26,890 --> 01:18:29,600
but he wanted only Music

1285
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,980
he wanted achievement above commitment

1286
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:39,200
howmuch ever I tried 
to convince him he refused

1287
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:43,810
he asked me abort you...

1288
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:45,830
he said with it very easily

1289
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:49,550
I said NO...

1290
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:53,120
leaving you and me behind...

1291
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:55,870
he went behind Music...

1292
01:19:00,740 --> 01:19:01,780
that is when he came in...

1293
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,030
even after listening to the truth...

1294
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,050
he agreed to marry me....

1295
01:19:13,450 --> 01:19:14,030
that's it...

1296
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:18,130
dear that's it...

1297
01:19:21,610 --> 01:19:22,730
this is what happened

1298
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:32,750
dear...

1299
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:54,750
then all these days...

1300
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,000
is this life a lie...!?

1301
01:19:57,830 --> 01:19:59,080
I have been living a lie!?

1302
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:24,190
waves can break the silence on the shores

1303
01:20:24,300 --> 01:20:31,760
but the scars on one's heart never erases

1304
01:20:31,850 --> 01:20:38,970
waves can break the silence on the shores

1305
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:46,390
but the scars on one's heart never erases

1306
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:53,610
like some one spills color in flowing water

1307
01:20:53,870 --> 01:21:01,250
how will I show the picture 
which came and went like a lightning

1308
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:08,580
someone is calling me in an alien city

1309
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:15,870
at this moment where will I go now

1310
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:25,170
I yearned to hear 
a whisper from the cool breeze

1311
01:21:25,230 --> 01:21:32,440
but why did you tranform into a tornado

1312
01:21:39,980 --> 01:21:47,230
when my dreams shine in your eyes

1313
01:21:47,350 --> 01:21:54,640
I learnt the divine language 
of eternal love

1314
01:21:54,760 --> 01:22:01,970
at a time when I mingled with you in tune

1315
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:09,500
how did I lose my own identity

1316
01:22:09,830 --> 01:22:17,200
Oh loneliness will you 
come with me for ever

1317
01:22:17,290 --> 01:22:25,540
in this path of journey 
pain follows happiness

1318
01:22:26,740 --> 01:22:33,780
waves can break the silence on the shores

1319
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:43,050
but the scars on one's heart never erases

1320
01:22:48,860 --> 01:22:53,360
Yaanaa 
(a Journey)

1321
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:59,720
Yaanaa 
(a Journey)

1322
01:23:03,680 --> 01:23:07,300
Yaanaa

1323
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:14,700
Yaanaa

1324
01:23:40,590 --> 01:23:41,380

you have your food, stomach full

1817
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,050

don't call me by my name

1818
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:51,590

1819
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:52,830
old people jealous me

1820
01:45:53,050 --> 01:45:53,880

1821
01:45:54,220 --> 01:45:56,720
because village all small 
small girls are behind me

1822
01:45:56,870 --> 01:45:58,270

1826
01:46:05,390 --> 01:46:06,020

make their bed in our room let them sleep 
-okay fine will do

1832
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:41,070
if any relatives come to our house

1833
01:46:41,390 --> 01:46:44,900
fearing they might stay in our room 
we first go and lock our room

1834
01:46:45,310 --> 01:46:46,140
but, here...

1835
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,350
we strangers came here by accident

1836
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,340
look how well they treated us

1837
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:52,700
really great Man

1838
01:46:53,050 --> 01:46:54,060
true Maya

1839
01:46:54,420 --> 01:46:55,800
villagers are always like this

1840
01:46:56,350 --> 01:46:58,400
they don't know to shower love in weight

1841
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:00,280
their heart is pure

1842
01:47:01,350 --> 01:47:02,890
even my family is very lovely

1843
01:47:03,380 --> 01:47:06,340
leaving such a lovely family behind 
I wanted to die

1844
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:08,910
even then I am lucky...

1845
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:10,520
I found you both

1846
01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:12,670
we are going to Goa together

1847
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:14,860
you know this is my first time

1848
01:47:14,970 --> 01:47:16,480
I was supposed to go when I was in P U C

1849
01:47:17,050 --> 01:47:18,440
my Dad never allowed me

1850
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:22,460
mostly...I was destined to go with you

1851
01:47:23,930 --> 01:47:24,760
oh my God...

1852
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:27,310
this was meant to happen

1853
01:47:27,390 --> 01:47:29,550
I am so exicted...Aah...

1854
01:47:29,710 --> 01:47:30,710

1855
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:43,610
collect payment for rice grains 
and pay the fertilizer dues and come

1856
01:47:43,740 --> 01:47:44,740
okay sir 
-done

1857
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:46,920
Good Morning Uncle

1858
01:47:47,930 --> 01:47:49,100
woke up? 
-Yes...

1859
01:47:49,340 --> 01:47:51,260
village house, bed hard like rock

1860
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:52,570
did you all have a sound sleep?

1861
01:47:52,710 --> 01:47:54,290
we had a sound sleep Uncle

1862
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:56,210
when all three said so in chorus

1863
01:47:56,430 --> 01:47:57,430
it means you had a good sleep 
-thank you Uncle

1864
01:47:57,630 --> 01:47:58,760
Uncle... 
-Aah...!

1865
01:47:58,850 --> 01:47:59,890
again another fest?

1866
01:48:00,080 --> 01:48:01,830
many people are working here

1867
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:02,760
come here

1868
01:48:03,260 --> 01:48:06,660
today an alliance is coming 
to see my daughter Radha

1869
01:48:08,350 --> 01:48:09,690
so all these arrangements

1870
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,050
Uncle, can we join the event?

1871
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:14,100
we are very intereseted 
in such type of functions

1872
01:48:14,220 --> 01:48:15,640
till date we have seen only in films

1873
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:17,130
will you stay back? 
-yes

1874
01:48:17,220 --> 01:48:19,510
okay fine stay back, no problem

1875
01:48:19,620 --> 01:48:20,330
Gowra...

1876
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,350
Oh god why do you shout? 
-where is Radha?

1877
01:48:23,780 --> 01:48:25,280
I think she is still sleeping

1878
01:48:25,700 --> 01:48:28,450
when I was of her age, 
I had her on my waist

1879
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:29,680
look at her...

1880
01:48:30,230 --> 01:48:32,440
forget engagement, 
not a single boy has liked her

1881
01:48:34,010 --> 01:48:39,390
I am tired preparing snacks 
and coffee for the grooms

1882
01:48:40,010 --> 01:48:43,180
prospective grooms come have snacks 
and go showing us their back

1883
01:48:43,550 --> 01:48:45,800
wonder when she will get married 
and go out of this house?

1884
01:48:45,950 --> 01:48:47,530
Gowra...hey...

1885
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:49,940
out of anger she speaks like this

1886
01:48:50,230 --> 01:48:51,570
what will poor Radha do?

1887
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:52,970
what does she know?

1888
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,360
not a boy matched in alliance

1889
01:48:55,550 --> 01:48:56,760
you will stay right? 
-yes

1890
01:48:56,930 --> 01:48:59,230
fine...stay back...

1891
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:09,930
Radha...

1892
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:16,000
hey Radha, what happened, 
why are you crying?

1893
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:18,970
I wanted to continue my studies

1894
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:21,220
I got distinction in P U C

1895
01:49:21,580 --> 01:49:24,500
but, unfortunately after P U C 
my parents stopped my studies

1896
01:49:24,770 --> 01:49:26,890
even then I didn't revolt, 
I just kept quite

1897
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:29,340
my studies burnt into ashes

1898
01:49:29,960 --> 01:49:31,710
and no groom came forward for marriage

1899
01:49:32,350 --> 01:49:35,220
the looks or his job doesn't bother me

1900
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:39,100
I am ready to get married 
but no boy is liking me

1901
01:49:39,460 --> 01:49:41,920
mostly I am not be beautiful

1902
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,280
hey Radha...

1903
01:49:43,570 --> 01:49:45,490
who told you are not beautiful?

1904
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:57,950
Urban Girls are getting ready 
to enhance the beauty of Radha

1905
01:49:58,040 --> 01:49:59,620
this is natural waxing you know

1906
01:49:59,970 --> 01:50:01,590
in our village, we do it this way

1907
01:50:02,230 --> 01:50:09,940
Girls gave a uplift to 
the natural beauty of the village lass

1908
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:13,790
the Kajal has added more sparkles

1909
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:17,520
the village lass is shy, 
after the transformation

1910
01:50:18,100 --> 01:50:24,680
wondering with awe on her beauty 
the village lass went on a procession

1911
01:50:25,620 --> 01:50:33,040
Urban Girls are getting ready 
to enhance the beauty of Radha

1912
01:50:33,170 --> 01:50:37,800
Radha's Happiness is at its peak

1913
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:42,490
Sir by the way, can we see the girl?

1914
01:50:42,580 --> 01:50:43,660
of course, sure 
-I will call her

1915
01:50:44,720 --> 01:50:48,470
after bathing in the Milky ocean

1916
01:50:48,630 --> 01:50:52,420
the village lass is laughing 
after showing the world her beauty

1917
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:00,240
after transformation, this beauty queen... 
-first offer it to the boy dear

1918
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:04,110
is inviting all through 
the sparkle of her eyes

1919
01:51:04,230 --> 01:51:07,980
this dream girl is shying away

1920
01:51:08,060 --> 01:51:11,900
she is an unbelievable wonder 
-you sit here

1921
01:51:12,050 --> 01:51:15,890
she resembles a bloomed Jasmine

1922
01:51:15,930 --> 01:51:19,890
This village lass transformed into a bride 
-Sir, from our side it is yes

1923
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:23,610
Happiness is on everyone's face 
-Sir, from our side it is yes

1924
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:27,180
let's find an Auspicious date 
and finish the engagement

1925
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:31,520
the Mother's heart soothed up now 
-even you can fix the Marriage date too

1926
01:51:32,070 --> 01:51:34,070
what is your opinion dear?

1927
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:35,810
will celebrate it in a large scale

1928
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:37,080
Dad...Dad...

1929
01:51:37,970 --> 01:51:38,600
yes dear!?

1930
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:39,760
I have a question

1931
01:51:42,240 --> 01:51:43,190
why at this time dear?

1932
01:51:43,580 --> 01:51:44,660
it's okay you go ahead

1933
01:51:44,800 --> 01:51:47,050
I wish to continue 
my studies after Marriage

1934
01:51:48,310 --> 01:51:49,100
will you educate me!?

1935
01:51:50,060 --> 01:51:51,400
sure you can continue your studies

1936
01:51:51,570 --> 01:51:53,660
after your education if you wish 
you can join service too

1937
01:51:53,860 --> 01:51:54,570
no problem

1938
01:51:58,860 --> 01:52:01,910
you are stepping into our house not as 
a Daughter in law, but as our Daughter

1939
01:52:11,740 --> 01:52:12,490
Mom...

1940
01:52:18,850 --> 01:52:19,350
che...

1941
01:52:20,500 --> 01:52:21,670
what a Women's life....

1942
01:52:22,780 --> 01:52:24,450
it's like tying 
a burning coal in one's pullu

1943
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:27,850
it is always pain to have 
a teen Daughter is at home

1944
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:31,950
and even more painful to send 
her away after Marriage

1945
01:52:34,810 --> 01:52:36,270
what a sinner I am

1946
01:52:37,770 --> 01:52:39,850
I have used very harsh language to you

1947
01:52:40,300 --> 01:52:41,550
I have scoulded you very badly

1948
01:52:41,620 --> 01:52:44,030
even wished you get out 
of this house soon too

1949
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:46,490
please pardon me...forgive me...

1950
01:52:46,660 --> 01:52:48,910
hey...didn't I tell you...

1951
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:50,230
didn't I tell you

1952
01:52:50,390 --> 01:52:52,560
when the right time comes 
every good thing will happen

1953
01:52:57,380 --> 01:53:00,550
all this happened because of these girls

1954
01:53:01,110 --> 01:53:02,610
the moment they stepped inside our house

1955
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:05,670
our Daughter's alliance got fixed

1956
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,030
I bless you all to be happy in life

1957
01:53:09,530 --> 01:53:10,690
dear...

1958
01:53:11,120 --> 01:53:12,670
on which auspicious time 
did you all step inside our house

1959
01:53:15,610 --> 01:53:17,220
God bless you all

1960
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,640
Uncle we didn't do anything great...

1961
01:53:19,720 --> 01:53:21,050
radha is very beautiful...

1962
01:53:21,220 --> 01:53:23,800
we just gave her 
a neat presentation, that's it

1963

what ever these experiences 
teaches you, is your lesson

1972
01:54:15,760 --> 01:54:21,560
fly towards the sky riding 
the horse of your dreams

1973
01:54:21,600 --> 01:54:27,690
every moment you move ahead 
searching for something new

1974
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:32,710
move ahead leaving behind 
people and this world

1975
01:54:32,780 --> 01:54:38,780
you heartly wished to be wanderer 
a new path is calling you

1976
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:44,480
if you happen see them somewhere 
don't stare,show them mercy

1977
01:54:45,790 --> 01:54:51,700
if you come out of four walls 
you can learn the lessons of life

1978
01:54:51,770 --> 01:54:56,770
don't tie up your wings let them loose

1979
01:54:57,390 --> 01:54:59,890
Oh my legs are aching

1980
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:02,550

1981
01:55:02,610 --> 01:55:04,440

1983
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:07,510
wonder where we are struck now?

1984
01:55:07,580 --> 01:55:10,410
I didn't know he would leave us here, 
that too in this forest

1985
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:13,090
all this happened because of you 
-hey, chill ya..stop it

1986
01:55:13,290 --> 01:55:14,290
it's already happened...

1987
01:55:14,370 --> 01:55:16,580
let's ask someone 
if there is any place to stay

1988
01:55:16,770 --> 01:55:17,390

1989
01:55:29,590 --> 01:55:30,680

1990
01:55:32,180 --> 01:55:33,100
the star...

1991
01:55:34,700 --> 01:55:35,490
that's my mother

1992
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,260
I was six years old

1993
01:55:40,030 --> 01:55:42,990
my mother was bed ridden 
since the day I got my senses

1994
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:46,180
when Dad learnt about my mother's illness

1995
01:55:46,350 --> 01:55:47,970
he stopped coming home

1996
01:55:49,030 --> 01:55:50,610
he even got married again

1997
01:55:51,610 --> 01:55:53,860
always I used to stay with my Mother

1998
01:55:54,200 --> 01:55:56,330
Mom, what's wrong with your health?

1999
01:55:58,230 --> 01:56:01,070

2000
01:56:03,950 --> 01:56:04,950

2003
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:14,120
whatever hardship you face in your life...

2004
01:56:15,100 --> 01:56:17,050

2005
01:56:18,850 --> 01:56:20,230

2006
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:24,360
Laugh now let me see

2007
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,180
I have promised my Mother

2008
01:56:29,880 --> 01:56:31,930
that I will always be a strong girl

2009
01:56:32,840 --> 01:56:36,970
always my Mother used 
to tell me to be strong

2010
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:39,890
I got know the reason about it 
only after her death...

2011
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:42,920
just to overcome the grief of her death

2012
01:56:43,890 --> 01:56:45,510
however strong I am...

2013
01:56:46,390 --> 01:56:49,720
when I am sad or lonely...

2014
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,560
to hug...

2015
01:56:52,430 --> 01:56:52,970
or...

2016
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:55,390
just to rest on a Mother's lap

2017
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,480
the pain of my mother absense...

2018
01:56:58,330 --> 01:56:59,620
haunts me a lot

2019
01:57:00,910 --> 01:57:02,200

2020
01:57:05,140 --> 01:57:07,050

02:05:15,190 --> 02:05:19,610
don't allow the roti to fall into ghee

2139
02:05:19,950 --> 02:05:28,870
ours is the land of Onion and spices 
we can't tolerate the heat here

2140
02:05:29,020 --> 02:05:33,600
we are tired of the summer without rain

2141
02:05:33,940 --> 02:05:38,690
if you agree we will marry you

2142
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:43,380
why should we marry a stranger 
who met us on the streets

2143
02:05:43,460 --> 02:05:48,040
not now, we will meet again 
we have plans to accomplish

2144
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:12,350
Sir, we want to go to Goa

2145
02:06:12,910 --> 02:06:14,160
can we get a car on rent?

2146
02:06:14,300 --> 02:06:16,210
you will get on rent, but not now

2147
02:06:16,490 --> 02:06:17,700
the car which is parked outside!?

2148
02:06:17,950 --> 02:06:20,080
that car we rent out for marriages

2149
02:06:20,260 --> 02:06:21,680
we liked that car very much

2150
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:22,790
please...

2151
02:06:22,840 --> 02:06:24,050
you have the license to drive right!?

2152
02:06:24,110 --> 02:06:25,160
yes we have it

2153
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:12,510
I feel I was a queen in my previous birth

2154
02:07:13,140 --> 02:07:15,020
this is my cave

2155
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:17,690
was this my Palace...!?

2156
02:07:17,830 --> 02:07:19,880
oh my God, is this reincarnation!?

2157
02:07:21,310 --> 02:07:23,860
I am a Queen...I am a Queen..

2158
02:07:27,690 --> 02:07:29,560
People, look here I have come

2159
02:07:29,610 --> 02:07:30,400
Hello...

2160
02:07:31,300 --> 02:07:32,240
it's Citizens...

2161
02:07:34,130 --> 02:07:41,960
Citizens, look here I have come

2162
02:07:42,920 --> 02:07:48,880
these tiny birds are on 
a journey spreading their wings

2163
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:54,840
out of their prison with joy 
their are on the Journey of their life

2164
02:07:54,930 --> 02:08:00,720
these tiny birds are on 
a journey spreading their wings

2165
02:08:00,930 --> 02:08:06,270
out of their prison with joy 
their are on the Journey of their life

2166
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:11,860
coming out of their cucoon, 
thinking this world belongs to them

2167
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:17,790
the birds are on a journey 
to enjoy their freedom...

2168
02:08:17,930 --> 02:08:23,980
they neither have a future goal 
nor a teacher behind them

2169
02:08:24,120 --> 02:08:30,290
only time will tell us their destination

2170
02:08:55,790 --> 02:08:56,500
MAYA

2171
02:08:56,550 --> 02:08:57,740
NANDINI...MAYA...ANJALI...

2172
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:22,760
do we have to really booze?

2173
02:09:23,120 --> 02:09:23,620
yes

2174
02:09:23,880 --> 02:09:24,880
my friends have told me,

2175
02:09:24,950 --> 02:09:27,120
in Goa one should learn to booze... 
-oh God...no..

2176
02:09:27,300 --> 02:09:29,130
you should drink above your limit...

2177
02:09:29,180 --> 02:09:31,600
and with regret you should quit boozing

2178
02:09:32,970 --> 02:09:34,970
some Tequila in the house

2179
02:09:36,430 --> 02:09:37,180
what is this!?

2180
02:09:37,200 --> 02:09:40,030
you both are having in small cups 
and given me a big bottle

2181
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:40,690
what!?

2182
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:43,870
no...

2183
02:09:45,320 --> 02:09:47,280
Uuh...Anjali...

2184
02:09:48,390 --> 02:09:49,850

2185
02:09:56,510 --> 02:09:58,310
oh my God...

2186
02:10:08,710 --> 02:10:10,370
you know who is my Grandfather?

2187
02:10:10,770 --> 02:10:12,560
you know who my Uncle is?

2188
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:14,370
you know anything about my Father?

2189
02:10:14,710 --> 02:10:16,340
or you know anything about my Uncle?

2190
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:17,620
I don't know

2191
02:10:17,690 --> 02:10:21,310
thank God, nobody will know that I boozed

2192
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:29,920
you know!?

2193
02:10:30,990 --> 02:10:32,700
in the N C C Team...

2194
02:10:33,070 --> 02:10:37,120

2195
02:10:37,950 --> 02:10:42,450
you both have never done it 
in front of your area Corporator

2196
02:10:44,690 --> 02:10:47,810
I have never seen any boy in my life

2197
02:10:48,090 --> 02:10:48,670
you know?

2198
02:10:50,720 --> 02:10:55,590
boys come to me on the pretext 
of borrowing notes and othe things

2199
02:10:56,760 --> 02:10:59,340
but, I haven't give them anything

2200
02:10:59,590 --> 02:11:02,460
leaving all them....

2201
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:06,370
I gave him my heart...

2202
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:10,920
the one which I had saved al these days

2203
02:11:12,860 --> 02:11:14,940
I gave him my first kiss too

2204
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:16,070
aah...!

2205
02:11:17,240 --> 02:11:18,110
first kiss..

2206
02:11:22,470 --> 02:11:26,180
he is the reason for drinking 
the phenol the other day

2207
02:11:26,720 --> 02:11:32,180
he is the reason for 
drinking alcohol today too

2208
02:11:41,140 --> 02:11:42,140
Ooh...

2209
02:11:42,420 --> 02:11:43,260

2212
02:12:01,530 --> 02:12:03,940

after you drank last night?

2213
02:12:04,150 --> 02:12:06,480

and out of your senses

2216
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:12,340

I brought you both here

2257
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:31,900
so...

2258
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:34,260
how is Sujatha related to you?

2259
02:16:35,340 --> 02:16:36,920
Aah...Sujatha...

2260
02:16:37,600 --> 02:16:39,140
ah..she is my Mother

2261
02:16:41,130 --> 02:16:41,960
oh...!

2262
02:16:48,670 --> 02:16:49,630
what are you doing?

2263
02:16:49,930 --> 02:16:51,180
Mechanical Engineering...

2264
02:16:51,480 --> 02:16:53,520
Ha...Music is my life...

2265
02:16:54,150 --> 02:16:56,650
I am a D J 
want to make it my profession

2266
02:16:57,230 --> 02:17:00,060
I want to achieve a lot, 
I have bundles of dreams

2267
02:17:00,140 --> 02:17:01,640
I wanna be a famouse DJ

2268
02:17:02,080 --> 02:17:04,160
will you mother support you to be a D J?

2269
02:17:05,050 --> 02:17:05,720
no...

2270
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:07,750
just asked you out of curiosity

2271
02:17:08,090 --> 02:17:12,010
because always she used to pester 
me about future Marrriage etc...

2272
02:17:14,030 --> 02:17:16,940
she didn't allow me to follow my passion

2273
02:17:17,890 --> 02:17:18,890
nor encouraged me

2274
02:17:19,890 --> 02:17:20,520
but...

2275
02:17:21,150 --> 02:17:22,650
at one point of time...

2276
02:17:24,920 --> 02:17:27,250
I was in love with Sujatha very much

2277
02:17:30,930 --> 02:17:33,520
but, when she talked 
about Marriage in a haste

2278
02:17:34,890 --> 02:17:36,350
I couldn't accept it

2279
02:17:37,020 --> 02:17:38,730
because I was chasing my dreams

2280
02:17:40,950 --> 02:17:41,950
my life...

2281
02:17:43,950 --> 02:17:44,650
my love...

2282
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:46,290
my soul...

2283
02:17:48,100 --> 02:17:49,510
everything was Music to me...

2284
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:51,480
and that was my goal too...

2285
02:17:52,990 --> 02:17:56,530
I didn't wish to get struck in a commitment

2286
02:17:58,020 --> 02:17:59,940
so I asked her to give me some time...

2287
02:18:00,700 --> 02:18:01,570
she told she was pregnant...

2288
02:18:02,610 --> 02:18:03,790
I told her to abort the fetus

2289
02:18:05,660 --> 02:18:06,500
she said NO...

2290
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:07,630
so...

2291
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:10,290
we both parted

2292
02:18:11,900 --> 02:18:14,150
when the question of life arises...

2293
02:18:15,120 --> 02:18:19,330
everyone has to a tuff decision in his life

2294
02:18:20,350 --> 02:18:24,270
all these love...sentiments...emotions...

2295
02:18:25,210 --> 02:18:26,710
are the truth of the moment, that's it

2296
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:32,830
the real truth is...life...

2297
02:18:33,640 --> 02:18:34,350
one's life...

2298
02:18:37,080 --> 02:18:38,170
you are a young girl...

2299
02:18:38,880 --> 02:18:40,340
you will not understand this now...

2300
02:18:40,890 --> 02:18:42,680
you will understand this later in your life

2301
02:18:44,960 --> 02:18:45,750
or...

2302
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:49,320
may be sometime in your life 
a situation like might come...

2303
02:18:50,210 --> 02:18:51,170
anyway...

2304
02:18:53,930 --> 02:18:54,520
well...

2305
02:18:55,930 --> 02:18:57,930
now what do you want from me?

2306
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:00,680
Money!?

2307
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:05,180
any influence...or my Surname?

2308
02:19:08,050 --> 02:19:10,210
did Sujatha send you to ask all this?

2309
02:19:12,890 --> 02:19:13,430
okay...

2310
02:19:14,100 --> 02:19:16,680
I will...I will do it for you

2311
02:19:17,840 --> 02:19:19,340
but, on one condition...

2312
02:19:19,850 --> 02:19:21,430
at any given time...nowhere on this earth

2313
02:19:22,510 --> 02:19:24,260
you will not tell anybody 
that I am your Father

2314
02:19:30,550 --> 02:19:33,350
just a week ago I got know 
that you are my father

2315
02:19:34,180 --> 02:19:37,860
from that moment, 
just to see you and speak to you...

2316
02:19:37,930 --> 02:19:41,050
I found your address 
on google and came here

2317
02:19:45,010 --> 02:19:49,180
but since 22 years you know that 
you have a Daughter...

2318
02:19:49,700 --> 02:19:52,990
not even one day 
you felt you should see me?

2319
02:19:54,790 --> 02:19:55,380
no...

2320
02:19:56,510 --> 02:20:00,430
the moment you told my mother to abort 
she coud have done it and gone her way

2321
02:20:00,800 --> 02:20:02,360
she brought me on this Earth

2322
02:20:02,550 --> 02:20:04,300
she has reared me, educated me...

2323
02:20:04,950 --> 02:20:07,450
and just for your sake, 
I have come leaving her behind

2324
02:20:08,270 --> 02:20:09,810
I am ashamed of myself

2325
02:20:12,490 --> 02:20:15,950
leaving me and mother 
just for the sake of your life...

2326
02:20:16,680 --> 02:20:19,260
without caring about what others speak...

2327
02:20:19,350 --> 02:20:22,720
I am proud of my other Father 
who gave a life to me and my mother

2328
02:20:23,010 --> 02:20:24,470
I can't draw a comparision between you both

2329
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:28,490
one who doesn't know the value 
of relationships speak like this

2330
02:20:29,490 --> 02:20:33,160
Ha, in future I think 
we will meet on stage someday

2331
02:20:33,910 --> 02:20:37,950
at that time, you don't tell others 
that I am your Daughter

2332
02:20:40,650 --> 02:20:41,440
by the way...

2333
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:43,090
what is your name?

2334
02:20:47,050 --> 02:20:47,760
Maya

2335
02:20:48,350 --> 02:20:49,430
Maya Jayadev

2336
02:20:56,350 --> 02:20:57,310
hey she is coming

2337
02:20:57,550 --> 02:20:58,220
Maya...!?

2338
02:20:58,640 --> 02:20:59,980
Maya what happened?

2339
02:21:00,600 --> 02:21:02,220
wait Maya...

2340
02:21:03,050 --> 02:21:04,430
what did your Dad say!?

2341
02:21:04,850 --> 02:21:06,180
Maya, what did your Dad say??

2342
02:21:06,260 --> 02:21:06,970
Maya...

2343
02:21:12,750 --> 02:21:13,370
maya

2344
02:21:14,950 --> 02:21:16,320
Maya what happened?

2345
02:21:21,180 --> 02:21:22,350
Maya, what happened?

2346
02:21:22,490 --> 02:21:26,150
I have never seen 
such a heartless man in my life

2347
02:21:32,010 --> 02:21:35,680
for his sake I fought with 
everybody and came here

2348
02:21:36,470 --> 02:21:37,470
Maya...

2349
02:21:39,390 --> 02:21:40,760
twenty years...

2350
02:21:40,850 --> 02:21:44,720
after twenty years 
his Daughter is before him...

2351
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:47,920
he had no feelings at all

2352
02:21:48,320 --> 02:21:49,860
Maya...please don't cry...

2353
02:21:50,970 --> 02:21:53,260
he just said give a damn...

2354
02:21:56,050 --> 02:21:58,290
shame on me, I called him my Dad...

2355
02:21:58,680 --> 02:22:00,640
I called him Dad...

2356
02:22:01,330 --> 02:22:03,450
Maya don't cry... 
-Maya please...

2357
02:22:03,660 --> 02:22:06,580
Maya calm down... 
-I am feeling angry on myself

2358
02:22:07,410 --> 02:22:09,370
I gave a lot of pain to my Dad

2359
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:12,050
Maya don't... 
-I hurt him so much

2360
02:22:13,390 --> 02:22:16,770
why did they tell me 
why did I come to know of this?

2361
02:22:16,830 --> 02:22:17,950
Maya... 
-Maya...

2362
02:22:18,000 --> 02:22:19,870
I want to see my Dad

2363
02:22:19,900 --> 02:22:20,730

the journey of life on this Earth

02:23:36,010 --> 02:23:41,590
our journey has the strength to move ahead

2392
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:48,920
the journey of life on this Earth

2393
02:23:49,140 --> 02:23:55,220
in our journey we have that friendship

2394
02:24:02,300 --> 02:24:11,210
this body is travelling 
like a vehicle without a destination

2395
02:24:12,050 --> 02:24:21,220
this body is travelling 
like a vehicle without a destination

2396
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:32,750
I will reach without knowing my way

2397
02:24:35,010 --> 02:24:41,550

2398
02:24:41,630 --> 02:24:48,050
steer me...save me...

2399
02:24:48,230 --> 02:24:54,360
let's together move far from here

2400
02:24:54,870 --> 02:25:02,580
let's together move far from here

2401
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:27,960
at last you came dear?

2402
02:25:36,250 --> 02:25:37,250
Dad

2403
02:25:38,970 --> 02:25:40,600
I am so Sorry Dad

2404
02:25:41,350 --> 02:25:44,140
I always knew, that you will come back

2405
02:25:44,630 --> 02:25:45,550
Don't cry dear

2406
02:25:45,800 --> 02:25:48,100
I love you Dad, Sorry...

2407
02:25:48,350 --> 02:25:49,600
there is nothing to pardon you

2408
02:25:52,230 --> 02:25:53,940
Dad, you are my Father

2409
02:25:54,800 --> 02:25:57,050
All is well, that ends well

2410
02:26:04,660 --> 02:26:05,370
Mom...

2411
02:26:08,890 --> 02:26:09,680
I am Sorry

2412
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:11,930
I am Sorr...

2413
02:26:13,050 --> 02:26:14,420
you don't apologise Mom

2414
02:26:15,460 --> 02:26:17,550
your decision was right

2415
02:26:30,020 --> 02:26:31,570
Mom, I missed you

2416
02:26:48,580 --> 02:26:49,420
Anjali...!?

2417
02:26:49,570 --> 02:26:51,190
Hello...

2418
02:26:51,800 --> 02:26:53,300
You...! 
-Hai...

2419
02:26:53,580 --> 02:26:54,870
where were you all these days!?

2420
02:26:54,970 --> 02:26:57,390
I was on a spiritual trip

2421
02:26:58,540 --> 02:26:59,870
it just happened the way I predicted...

2422
02:26:59,900 --> 02:27:01,360
I told you, the other day I went....

2423
02:27:01,970 --> 02:27:02,510
what!?

2424
02:27:07,670 --> 02:27:08,340
Oh...!

2425
02:27:16,390 --> 02:27:18,300
all of a sudden 
why did you all became silent?

2426
02:27:20,150 --> 02:27:20,820
Neha...

2427
02:27:21,180 --> 02:27:23,600
I shouldn't have behaved 
so rudely the other day...

2428
02:27:24,140 --> 02:27:24,970
I am sorry...

2429
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:26,490
its okay no problem...

2430
02:27:30,220 --> 02:27:30,890
Varun...

2431
02:27:31,190 --> 02:27:32,360
now I understood...

2432
02:27:32,610 --> 02:27:34,530
how much I irretated you...

2433
02:27:35,020 --> 02:27:35,900
and you were right...

2434
02:27:36,220 --> 02:27:39,720
you would always tell me 
Anjali grow up...grow up...

2435
02:27:40,040 --> 02:27:41,120
I hope I have...

2436
02:27:42,220 --> 02:27:45,200
since childhood I never 
went to a co education school

2437
02:27:45,470 --> 02:27:47,350
I was brought up amidst only girls

2438
02:27:47,690 --> 02:27:49,900
no interaction with boys at all

2439
02:27:51,040 --> 02:27:54,840
but, you came, spoke well 
treated me well too...

2440
02:27:55,300 --> 02:27:56,880
and I started getting attracted to you...

2441
02:27:59,130 --> 02:28:02,840
assuming it to be love 
I became possessive towards you

2442
02:28:04,100 --> 02:28:06,380
God, I was so stupid...

2443
02:28:07,090 --> 02:28:09,500
neither I could understand your feelings...

2444
02:28:09,680 --> 02:28:10,510
nor dared to ask you too...

2445
02:28:11,290 --> 02:28:12,460
and that's my mistake

2446
02:28:13,130 --> 02:28:13,960
I am sorry

2447
02:28:16,570 --> 02:28:17,280
Thank you...

2448
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:18,970
Thank you for the memories...

2449
02:28:22,830 --> 02:28:23,460
Varun...

2450
02:28:23,970 --> 02:28:25,640
you will always be my special one...

2451
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:27,600
let's move on...

2452
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:58,010
dude...look there

2453
02:28:58,740 --> 02:28:59,580
Rahul...

2454
02:29:00,120 --> 02:29:01,830
call the software guy

2455
02:29:02,320 --> 02:29:05,070
hey silent Rahul, come here' 
your sweetheart has come

2456
02:29:10,930 --> 02:29:13,680
hey, how dare you cut my call!?

2457
02:29:15,160 --> 02:29:17,910
guys, if your girl call 
will you cut the call?

2458
02:29:17,970 --> 02:29:19,550
we will skip a meal...

2459
02:29:19,640 --> 02:29:21,260
but will never cut our girl's call

2460
02:29:22,390 --> 02:29:24,510
now what, do I have to apologise!?

2461
02:29:25,470 --> 02:29:26,010
okay...

2462
02:29:26,550 --> 02:29:27,260
I am sorry...

2463
02:29:29,460 --> 02:29:31,960
Aah, you wanted to tell me 
something on that day...

2464
02:29:32,290 --> 02:29:33,500
will you tell me now!?

2465
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:36,780
that is...Umm...

2466
02:29:37,180 --> 02:29:39,260
that is... 
-oh God...

2467
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:41,430
our boy is of shy nature

2468
02:29:41,720 --> 02:29:44,680
you tell him, it will take 
another year for him to tell you

2469
02:29:47,620 --> 02:29:49,200
fine, I will tell you

2470
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:54,510
Rahul...I love you

2471
02:30:01,300 --> 02:30:02,130
I love you...

2472
02:30:06,420 --> 02:30:07,420
I missed you

2473
02:30:15,170 --> 02:30:16,170
I told you other day

2474
02:30:17,250 --> 02:30:18,500
do we need this election?

2475
02:30:18,600 --> 02:30:19,600
is this speech necessary?

2476
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:22,890
no opposition canditate here...

2477
02:30:23,330 --> 02:30:25,310
announce my name as the President...

2478
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:38,740
how did you hide it 
in your heart all these days?

2479
02:30:39,300 --> 02:30:41,350
we shared ur problems with you right!?

2480
02:30:41,720 --> 02:30:44,850
any girl on this earth 
can face your problems...

2481
02:30:45,820 --> 02:30:47,400
but the insult I faced...

2482
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:53,640
they know very well 
whatever they do girls don't speak out

2483
02:30:53,970 --> 02:30:55,680
boys behave so rudely...

2484
02:30:58,710 --> 02:31:01,460
you have to bring out 
his other face in public...

2485
02:31:01,590 --> 02:31:03,280
only then you will get justice...

2486
02:31:05,780 --> 02:31:08,240
if you fear even a dog will chase you...

2487
02:31:08,400 --> 02:31:10,990
but, if you revolt, 
even a tiger will flee...

2488
02:31:23,260 --> 02:31:24,010
Hello...

2489
02:31:24,970 --> 02:31:25,970
hello everbody...

2490
02:31:36,040 --> 02:31:37,410
you all must be wondering...

2491
02:31:38,090 --> 02:31:41,140
how did she come here after all the insult?

2492
02:31:41,860 --> 02:31:44,200
to be frank, 
for a few days even I felt the same

2493
02:31:45,020 --> 02:31:47,270
why just that, even I felt like dying...

2494
02:31:48,140 --> 02:31:49,470
even thought of locking me up in four walls

2495
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:51,860
I wished no one sees me

2496
02:31:53,410 --> 02:31:56,570
this election...college...life... 
everything is bullshit...

2497
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:57,940
I don't need this...

2498
02:31:58,250 --> 02:31:59,660
anyway the end is near...

2499
02:32:00,390 --> 02:32:03,770
thought, let me make my end differently 
thinking so I stepped out...

2500
02:32:04,750 --> 02:32:07,330
the moment I came out, 
you know what I felt...!

2501
02:32:08,010 --> 02:32:10,600
to my surpise I felt 
no one knew me here...

2502
02:32:11,400 --> 02:32:13,480
everybody's life was important to them...

2503
02:32:14,740 --> 02:32:18,990
me alongwith my insult 
felt lonely in this world...

2504
02:32:20,770 --> 02:32:22,230
that moment I realised...

2505
02:32:23,030 --> 02:32:25,070
that my insult was my companion...

2506
02:32:26,360 --> 02:32:28,860
really it might seem bizzare to you...

2507
02:32:29,400 --> 02:32:32,610
if I say the girl you saw 
in the MMS isn't me...

2508
02:32:33,350 --> 02:32:35,510
few who have affection 
towards me will believe

2509
02:32:36,560 --> 02:32:37,980
but, I don't wish to lie...

2510
02:32:39,070 --> 02:32:40,150
yes, I am the same girl...

2511
02:32:46,720 --> 02:32:48,470
yes...it's me...

2512
02:32:50,800 --> 02:32:52,340
if I think of the incident 
which happened on that day...

2513
02:32:53,370 --> 02:32:54,700
my heart bleeds...

2514
02:32:56,140 --> 02:32:57,600
it is not that I made a mistake...

2515
02:32:58,700 --> 02:33:00,620
to be precise I haven't done any mistake

2516
02:33:02,660 --> 02:33:05,830
I shared some intense moments 
with someone I really loved...

2517
02:33:07,690 --> 02:33:09,110
my love was pure...

2518
02:33:10,230 --> 02:33:11,570
I was in love...

2519
02:33:14,180 --> 02:33:14,800
okay...

2520
02:33:15,430 --> 02:33:18,430
if I didn't do a mistake... 
where did the mistake happen?

2521
02:33:20,300 --> 02:33:21,380
the mistake happened in my trust...

2522
02:33:22,780 --> 02:33:26,530
the thought that the boy I am in love, 
loved me too...

2523
02:33:26,660 --> 02:33:27,950
the mistake was in my innocence...

2524
02:33:30,150 --> 02:33:31,660
I didn't realise it on that day...

2525
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:34,860
on seeing the MMS he created...

2526
02:33:35,870 --> 02:33:37,070
I was shocked...

2527
02:33:38,060 --> 02:33:39,390
I was devastated...

2528
02:33:44,460 --> 02:33:47,750
from there, to end my life, 
I found another begining...

2529
02:33:48,760 --> 02:33:50,800
the new begining 
gave me a new perspective...

2530
02:33:51,540 --> 02:33:57,830
my agony...insult...weakness ended...

2531
02:33:58,850 --> 02:34:00,470
now I am transformed...

2532
02:34:01,290 --> 02:34:02,880
I am a new girl today

2533
02:34:06,810 --> 02:34:09,010
some day in future the same might 
happen to any one of you...

2534
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:11,500
at that time face it with courage...

2535
02:34:15,460 --> 02:34:18,080
boys behave so rudely only because...

2536
02:34:18,180 --> 02:34:20,890
they know very well 
whatever they do girls don't speak out

2537
02:34:23,100 --> 02:34:25,180
if you fear even a dog will chase you...

2538
02:34:25,930 --> 02:34:28,630
but, if you revolt, 
even a tiger will flee...

2539
02:34:30,690 --> 02:34:32,440
the reason for my courage are...

2540
02:34:33,660 --> 02:34:35,910
my friends who were 
strangers till yesterday...

2541
02:34:37,850 --> 02:34:39,640
Maya...and Anjali...

2542
02:34:41,930 --> 02:34:43,180
they are my soulmates...

2543
02:34:43,930 --> 02:34:44,600
Thank you

2544
02:34:45,980 --> 02:34:47,440
thank you so much...

2545
02:34:54,370 --> 02:34:56,670
the other day what did 
you tell me on this spot?

2546
02:34:57,530 --> 02:34:58,740
that you finished me right?

2547
02:34:59,090 --> 02:35:00,510
you said, you are finished...

2548
02:35:01,810 --> 02:35:02,980
but guess what...

2549
02:35:03,490 --> 02:35:04,490
I am back...

2550
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:08,850
you know what is the life of your MMS?

2551
02:35:09,370 --> 02:35:11,490
it's alive till a new MMS crops up...

2552
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:14,280
then it will be a gossip...

2553
02:35:14,760 --> 02:35:17,220
later it will be dud...

2554
02:35:20,720 --> 02:35:23,600
in the name of love 
how did you wish to do this!?

2555
02:35:26,670 --> 02:35:27,580
remember this...

2556
02:35:28,010 --> 02:35:30,720
the day girls stand up 
facing their insult...

2557
02:35:30,920 --> 02:35:34,250
masculinity of boys 
like you will be a nil...

2558
02:35:34,690 --> 02:35:36,400
a big Zero...

2559
02:35:46,260 --> 02:35:49,350
a few of you might have stored the MMS...

2560
02:35:49,940 --> 02:35:50,940
that's your wish...

2561
02:35:51,420 --> 02:35:53,380
I will not urge you to delete it

2562
02:35:54,600 --> 02:35:58,180
if you know that it is a cheating 
done by some one to another soul...

2563
02:35:58,570 --> 02:35:59,270
That's enough...

2564
02:36:02,090 --> 02:36:05,220
I am least bothered 
about the election result...

2565
02:36:06,220 --> 02:36:07,390
I am already a winner...

2566
02:36:08,380 --> 02:36:11,840
my journey has taught me, 
not to run away from my problems...

2567
02:36:12,340 --> 02:36:13,340
but, to face it...

2568
02:36:22,160 --> 02:36:22,870
Thank you...

2569
02:36:24,300 --> 02:36:25,550
Thank you so much

2570
02:36:50,410 --> 02:36:56,280
these tiny birds are ready 
to fly spreading their wings

2571
02:36:56,390 --> 02:37:02,260
journey has begun with full of happiness

2572
02:37:02,410 --> 02:37:08,340
these tiny birds are ready 
to fly spreading their wings

2573
02:37:08,430 --> 02:37:13,720
journey has begun with full of happiness

2574
02:37:13,850 --> 02:37:19,340
coming out of their cucoon 
thinking this world belongs to them...

2575
02:37:19,470 --> 02:37:25,150
the birds have joined hands 
to enjoy their freedom

2576
02:37:25,450 --> 02:37:31,450
they neither have a future goal 
nor a teacher behind them

2577
02:37:31,510 --> 02:37:37,740
only time will tell us their destination
