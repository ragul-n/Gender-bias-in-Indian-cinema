1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250


3
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,000
Porur....

4
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:11,125
This is the stance for those who comes
new to Chennai in search of life.

5
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,833
Hey, share auto.

6
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:14,625
Madam, Are you going to porur?
-yes, brother.

7
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,583
Get in, madam.
-we're five people.

8
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,958
You've place.
-okay, brother.

9
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,000
Dude, one of you come front.

10
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,458
There is place....
-me?

11
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,792
Yes, come front.

12
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,000
Get in.

13
00:03:26,417 --> 00:03:27,833
Adjust and sit, madam.

14
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,250
-didn't Geetha come?
-she said she'll go by bus.

15
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,833
He'll see many girls
in his office.

16
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,958
He might've sit at the front.

17
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,250
Where are you going?
-Valasaravakkam.

18
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,250
Twenty Rupees is the fare.

19
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,083
You shouldn't bargain
when getting down.

20
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:44,083
He would've seen my stature.

21
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,875
But, I was different in
my native place.

22
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:02,500
We do the work,
and you enjoy the results?

23
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,750
Why you keep shouting that you
cultivated the soil?

24
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,417
You were paid for it, isn't it?

25
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,625
We also eat by buying the crops.

26
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:11,417
Money isn't important.
It is temporary.

27
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:14,917
Hey, can't you help me out?

28
00:04:14,917 --> 00:04:16,708
I must buy a new remote.

29
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:19,125
You're stretching the legs well, right?

30
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:20,000
Change with it.

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,958
Sivagami...

32
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:26,167
How will he be good,
if you scold me whenever I advise him?

33
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,333
Dad, buy a remote
when you go to town.

34
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,500
Okay.

35
00:04:35,792 --> 00:04:37,833
Hey, your friend has come.

36
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:40,708
Dad, I'm going to the town.

37
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,708
I'll buy.

38
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:42,833
Give two hundred rupees.

39
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:47,417
Have it, dad.

40
00:04:49,792 --> 00:04:51,250
Hey, I'm coming, wait.

41
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:56,792
Why are you irritating
when you know I'm coming.

42
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:58,542
Guys keep calling.
-go...

43
00:04:58,542 --> 00:05:00,125
I had a dignity.

44
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:02,458
Guys behave furiously
when I'm around.

45
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,083
We'll be ready for a brawl.

46
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:07,625
If anyone talks harsh before me...

47
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,083
Don't leave them, Saravanan.

48
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,000
Hit them.

49
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:14,792
Thrash them.

50
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:54,917
If you dare, conflict and courage
comes together.

51
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,125
You can search me here too.

52
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:00,292
Sign and get in, Saravanan.

53
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,417
Who comes here
other than me?

54
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,083
You're right.

55
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,708
But, if you don't sign,
the library will be closed...

56
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:10,333
... citing lack of visitors as a reason.
Is it okay?

57
00:06:11,167 --> 00:06:14,208
Has the second part
of "Marma vidhai" came?

58
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,417
It'll take two days.

59
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,125
"Psychology of the Library"

60
00:06:19,542 --> 00:06:22,125
If you take a particular book
in the rack of the library...

61
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:24,333
...and keep in another rack.

62
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,583
Later, If you ask the librarian
to search for that book...

63
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,125
Sir, I've kept the book
which I took from another rack.

64
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,125
Find out, if you can.

65
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:31,875
I'm in work.

66
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:33,125
Come on, sir.

67
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:35,417
It's not found.

68
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:39,208
He'll search in
the related rack only.

69
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:41,958
His thoughts and hands
won't go to other racks.

70
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:42,667
What?

71
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:43,792
Just a minute.

72
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,125
Read this.

73
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:54,000
You're more curious.

74
00:06:54,542 --> 00:06:55,417
That means?

75
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,500
Attitude?
-Not attitude.

76
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,042
It's either eagerness or searching.

77
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:03,333
But, it's worst than
the attitude you said.

78
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,958
Dad, don't get tensed.

79
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:20,208
I'm just trying
as everyone smokes.

80
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:26,458
If I feel good,
I may continue.

81
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,833
Your life is in your hands.

82
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:35,542
Some habits will not leave us,
though we try our best to leave that.

83
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:47,000
I was a drop out after eighth grade.

84
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,708
Atleast , I should've studied
upto tenth grade.

85
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:54,333
But, for the school practical projects...

86
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,500
...children in my street
will come to me.

87
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:04,417
You could've shown
this interest when you studied.

88
00:08:04,417 --> 00:08:06,500
Practical knowledge is education.

89
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,667
If it's only practicals,
it's good to study.

90
00:08:08,667 --> 00:08:12,083
Instead, something is taught
unnecessarily.

91
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,708
That should be by-hearted
and written as exam.

92
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,417
Right?
-yes, brother.

93
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,417
Dude, look here.

94
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,833
How the car door is opened!

95
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,167
Show me.

96
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:26,708
Dude, you're doing unwanted things.

97
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,292
It's because of you.
-hey Saravanan, no need.

98
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:28,958
What I did?

99
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:30,333
I just showed him the video.

100
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:31,208
Saravanan...

101
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,417
Is it necessary?
-hey, Saravanan

102
00:08:32,417 --> 00:08:33,167
Something may happen.
-won't you listen?

103
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,083
Listen us.
-be quiet.

104
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:34,792
He broke it.

105
00:08:34,792 --> 00:08:35,125
Hey...

106
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,208
Dad, are you aware
what he did along with others?

107
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,833
-hey...
He is a guy.

108
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,708
He do whatever he wish.

109
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:44,125
You don't speak anything about him.

110
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:45,958
You spoilt him by saying so.

111
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,500
He is not at all staying at home.

112
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,167
You're not asking him anything.

113
00:08:56,042 --> 00:08:58,000
Why are you silent?

114
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,208
He doesn't know what's happening
in the house.

115
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:01,333
But, for others....

116
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:01,750
Serve me the curry.

117
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,792
It's okay.

118
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,792
I'm not well nowadays.

119
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,167
Take care.

120
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:20,167
They've sent me to Chennai
with their sentimental reasons.

121
00:09:20,917 --> 00:09:22,583
A year has passed
since I came to Chennai.

122
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:28,042
I've shifted many jobs.
Nothing is good for me.

123
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:31,042
Wherever I go,
this blue shirt is given.

124
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,333
Like the sky without clouds.

125
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,417
Sometimes, it's the job where
I speak only with the machines.

126
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:48,125
Always crowded.

127
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,458
Nothing apart from that.

128
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:02,000
I never washed my plate in home.

129
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,333
But, I was given the job of
preparing the juices.

130
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,083
I slit my finger while cutting
the pomegranate when new to the job.

131
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:11,375
But, I like to know the unknown things.

132
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:17,042
In couple of days, my hands, knife
and fruits have become familiar for me.

133
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:26,583
Mani, my friend is taking care
of me not letting...

134
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,208
... to take up any other job
and to go anywhere.

135
00:10:30,417 --> 00:10:34,250
And Anandhi working in the
opposite shop, which is locked now.

136
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,583
-Hello,
-tell me, brother.

137
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,958
-Heard that there is an
acre of land in Padappai.

138
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:03,250
Welcome, sir.

139
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,417
Saravanan, a glass of watermelon juice.

140
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:08,833
-okay, the business is going on good.

141
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,292
-I must meet the boss
to discuss some things.

142
00:11:13,292 --> 00:11:15,625
-need an appointment.

143
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:19,417
-what happened to two C...
-thank you.

144
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,125
Pay thirty rupees.

145
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,167
-brother, take it.

146
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:28,417
I'll leave.
-okay, sir.

147
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,125
-the number you're trying to reach is
currently switched off or not reachable.

148
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,542
Saravanan, look here.

149
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,125
It's the same,
how many times you call.

150
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:49,542
You didn't speak just for two days.
She'll come tomorrow, leave it.

151
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,833
What's the news
about actress, Nayanthara?

152
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:51,875
Read and tell me.

153
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,958
I'll break your tooth.

154
00:11:54,625 --> 00:11:56,875
Then, you were blabbering that
the share auto driver...

155
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:57,792
... made you to sit in front.

156
00:11:57,792 --> 00:11:58,875
That's different.

157
00:11:58,875 --> 00:11:59,958
She is my love...

158
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:01,083
Everyone is woman, right?

159
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:04,625
Mani, there is a difference between
flirting and love.

160
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:05,792
You won't understand that.

161
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,917
You say something and
conclude that I won't understand.

162
00:12:07,917 --> 00:12:09,417
I can understand only
if you say in the way, I understand.

163
00:12:10,167 --> 00:12:11,375
Brother, a tea.

164
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:12,958
You've got a job. Go...

165
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:19,333
I didn't believe till
two months ago.

166
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,917
That, she'll fall in love
with me.

167
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,500
I hesitated to talk with her.

168
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,875
Because of her eyes!

169
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,667
Brother, a tea.

170
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:35,333
Brother, I feel someone is
following me, wherever I go.

171
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,542
Should I inform you and go?

172
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:40,125
Will you say it as accidental
coming behind me wherever I go?

173
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:40,875
No...

174
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:41,583
Just to see you.

175
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:45,917
Take it.

176
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,708
Why did you speak so?

177
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,292
Leave it.

178
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:53,917
Now she knows,
I'm looking at her.

179
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,667
It's her decision,
whether to like me or not.

180
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,208
You're managing well.

181
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,583
Hey, why are you
shouting in the shop?

182
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,250
Do you think of you as beauteous?

183
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,417
No.

184
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:11,333
I don't think of me as beauteous.

185
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:14,125
It's you thinking and looking so.

186
00:14:16,292 --> 00:14:18,042
Saravanan, don't look like that.

187
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:52,375
What happened?

188
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:08,708
"I saw my love..."

189
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,583
"I felt your fragrance in my heart..."

190
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:16,417
"I was perplexed whether
I'm your's or mine?"

191
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:20,333
"Come on...my soul,
you're my everything..."

192
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:23,792
"You...the rain drops
in the loneliness..."

193
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:27,958
"You spoke in my silence..."

194
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:31,542
"I was lost with my conscious..."

195
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:36,250
"Is this the fever of love?"

196
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:41,417
"The valiant lass,
You roam around my heart,"

197
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:45,292
"I'm stumbling and getting
seduced behind you..."

198
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:49,167
"You're doing something
with your gestures of eyes"

199
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:52,958
"The valiant lass...oh,"

200
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:24,083
"The heart beats by the
ecstasy which this love grants."

201
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:28,583
"The soul doesn't get deflated"
"Doesn't get laze..."

202
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:31,792
"It plays in the whole mind
And steals..."

203
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:36,000
"Without sleeping everyday"
"Without going away..."

204
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,833
"When I see myself in the mirror"

205
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:45,292
"My eyes search you."

206
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:51,208
"Shall I lie that it's enough?"

207
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:57,167
"The valiant lass,
You roam around my heart,"

208
00:16:57,167 --> 00:17:01,000
"I'm stumbling and getting
seduced behind you..."

209
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,875
"You're doing something
with your gestures of eyes"

210
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:08,917
"The valiant lass...oh,"

211
00:17:16,417 --> 00:17:20,292
"I saw my love..."

212
00:17:20,292 --> 00:17:24,167
"I felt your fragrance in my heart..."

213
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:28,000
"I was perplexed whether
I'm your's or mine?"

214
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,875
"Come on...my soul,
you're my everything..."

215
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:35,375
"You...the rain drops
in the loneliness..."

216
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:39,500
"You spoke in my silence..."

217
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,125
"I was lost with my conscious..."

218
00:17:54,792 --> 00:17:57,583
A musical line from
"Thaanaa Serndha Koottam".

219
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,458
A musical line from
"Mersal".

220
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,458
Hey, stay on to one channel.

221
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:04,417
That remote will cry out,
if it has life.

222
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,333
You're taking my life
as she didn't attend your call.

223
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,125
When everyone is watching
the other programme of a doctor,

224
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,625
You're simply watching this one?

225
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,458
Hey, we've to watch
what we don't know.

226
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,458
Then, you know those things!

227
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:25,875
After ten, everyone will watch
different programme.

228
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:28,625
But, you're watching
a monotonous programme.

229
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:29,542
Hey...

230
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:31,625
Be seated.

231
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,500
He has started.

232
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,208
What?

233
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,000
Listen carefully.

234
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,083
When we occupy the house
where someone has resided earlier,

235
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,167
If we search in the idle place
of that house...

236
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:43,625
...we might get some old
and different materials.

237
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:44,583
Different means?

238
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:46,333
Different...

239
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,792
Like an old coin.

240
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,583
Is that programme about this?

241
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:53,708
Now, the TV stand is there
right from the day we came.

242
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,333
Yes.

243
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,500
Just put your hand under that.

244
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,458
You'll get something.

245
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:02,667
Hey, bend well and search.

246
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:06,458
Nothing is here.

247
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,125
Your research is a failure.

248
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,458
Nothing is there.

249
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,833
I got back pain.

250
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,750
Two things, Mani.

251
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,333
When this programme was
telecasted last week,

252
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:24,625
I searched and found this old coin.

253
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,042
You said, you got back pain.

254
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:29,000
Then, you have to watch
this sort of programme.

255
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:29,500
Take it.

256
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:36,917
You'd have brought the
other people when coming.

257
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,708
Have you slept?

258
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,792
No, sister.
- have I disturbed you?

259
00:19:39,792 --> 00:19:40,417
No, it's okay.

260
00:19:40,417 --> 00:19:41,250
Isn't Mani there?

261
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,417
I'll call him.

262
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,042
Hey, the owner has come.

263
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:51,917
She is calling you.

264
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,542
Mani, I ordered for a bureau.

265
00:19:56,542 --> 00:19:58,708
Will you help the people
who comes along with it?

266
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,667
Okay, sister.

267
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:00,958
I checked for Ibrahim.

268
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,125
He went for night shift, it seems.

269
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,083
It's locked.

270
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:03,792
It's okay, sister.

271
00:20:03,792 --> 00:20:04,833
We'll help.

272
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:06,542
Murugan, be careful.

273
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:08,167
It's of heavy weight.

274
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:08,917
Hello...

275
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,958
Yes.
Is it Saligramam?

276
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:12,458
I'll go at nine o'clock
in the morning for coverage.

277
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,417
Turn it carefully.
-It's the garbage news, right?

278
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,125
Not that mam,
it's about garbage.

279
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,000
I'll go, mam.

280
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,208
Sathish, you seem to be very busy.

281
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:24,417
When the half-an-hour news slot
has become full time channels...

282
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:26,833
...even petty things
have to be turned out as news.

283
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,875
We must see everything as news.

284
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:29,625
Here, inside...

285
00:20:29,667 --> 00:20:32,375
You're struggling to lift this one.

286
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,042
You'll know, only if you lift.

287
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:34,958
Turn it.

288
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:35,792
Turn it.

289
00:20:35,792 --> 00:20:36,625
Keep on the wood.

290
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,792
Sir....
Just a minute, sir.

291
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:39,833
Good, I came late.

292
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,167
Else, they would've asked me to lift.

293
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,625
You work hard.

294
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,958
If you work for a popular channel,
we'll be proud of you.

295
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,208
It's a locale channel.
-wait, I'll come.

296
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,958
Why did she ask then?

297
00:20:49,292 --> 00:20:50,500
Keep next to the deity's image.

298
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,292
Wait... Wait.

299
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,583
Okay.
Be careful.

300
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,875
The handle is towards the wall.

301
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,042
We'll turn it.

302
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,417
It's okay, leave it.

303
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,000
It has to be given
as dowry for her.

304
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,875
Okay, let's move it aside.

305
00:21:03,417 --> 00:21:05,542
Take hundred rupees each.
-okay, we'll leave, madam.

306
00:21:07,667 --> 00:21:08,583
Shall we leave?

307
00:21:09,042 --> 00:21:09,958
Wait.

308
00:21:11,167 --> 00:21:11,792
Satish, you...

309
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,292
Right from locale channel
I'll step up to a popular channel.

310
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:15,333
Not that.

311
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,583
Ask Shanti sister to come immediately.

312
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,500
Whether I shift the channel or not,
I must shift the house.

313
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,292
-She keeps saying.
Ask her to come immediately.

314
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:24,500
-she would've heard your voice.

315
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,792
She will give for us too.
-Be quiet.

316
00:21:27,292 --> 00:21:29,167
-You guys...
Sister, we don't want anything.

317
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:30,125
Had food?

318
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,417
Yes.

319
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,000
She came to ask that.

320
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:34,833
They thought, you're going
to give money.

321
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:37,333
Will I pay for the help
rendered by our guys?

322
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,167
It's a insult.

323
00:21:38,167 --> 00:21:39,083
What guys?

324
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:40,292
Yes, we're leaving.

325
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:40,833
Okay.

326
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,250
Lakshmi.
-I'm coming.

327
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,000
Yeah dear...

328
00:21:46,708 --> 00:21:48,750
The shopkeeper will pay
for delivering the bureau.

329
00:21:49,417 --> 00:21:50,417
Then, why are you paying?

330
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,708
If they've left instead carrying it,
what can we do?

331
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,875
I gave just two hundred rupees
for both of them.

332
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:57,125
What's the loss because of that?

333
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,250
Those who help us
is more important than money.

334
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:03,417
He keeps saying something.

335
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,375
-nothing happened so far.

336
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,417
-ask him?

337
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,042
Hey, don't be in a hurry.

338
00:22:10,042 --> 00:22:11,000
The shop owner is here.

339
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,167
Start after he leaves.

340
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,417
I asked for a tea.
It's yet to come.

341
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:15,083
I'm coming.

342
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,458
-call him and ask.

343
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,208
Mani.

344
00:22:21,625 --> 00:22:24,083
If anyone comes to the shop
and ask you unusual things...

345
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,917
...call me immediately.

346
00:22:25,917 --> 00:22:27,333
Okay, boss.
- Tell him too.

347
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm leaving.

348
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,750
-tell me, customer is waiting here.

349
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,958
Hey, what the boss said...

350
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,333
Take care.
-Hey...

351
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:36,167
- he ever says the same.
Nothing happened so far.

352
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,250
Anandhi.

353
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,417
-how much is the full talktime
in Vodafone?

354
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:41,750
One hundred and twenty rupees.

355
00:22:50,917 --> 00:22:52,875
Why the shop is closed for two days?

356
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:54,250
Have you changed your number?

357
00:22:58,292 --> 00:22:59,667
I'm asking you.

358
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:01,708
Yesterday was my engagement.

359
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,208
Were you compelled?

360
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,833
How to say?

361
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:08,958
What are you going to say?

362
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,125
Is it that you're friendly
with me all these days?

363
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:12,542
He is my uncle's son.

364
00:23:12,542 --> 00:23:14,875
He got a government job
as a teacher.

365
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,667
I like you.

366
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:18,042
I don't deny.

367
00:23:18,083 --> 00:23:21,958
If I sit over and think,
It's like I am spoiling my life.

368
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:25,917
Have you ever recharged
for just rupees fifty?

369
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:28,125
Think about your job?

370
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,500
You'll understand, what I say.

371
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,625
Don't you know about my job
when roaming around with me?

372
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:33,750
It's time for the customers
to come.

373
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,708
If you want to create ruckus
and spoil my life,

374
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:36,833
Then, stand here.

375
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:57,917
(Indistinct voices)

376
00:23:57,917 --> 00:24:00,583
Will you take so long
to find out that I'm in the bar?

377
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:02,833
I know well that you'll be
in the bar by the way you left.

378
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,750
But, I didn't expect this late.

379
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:08,917
Hey, brother.
-brother.

380
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,375
Tell me.

381
00:24:12,167 --> 00:24:14,833
Get me a MC quarter,
four water packets and a cup.

382
00:24:15,292 --> 00:24:17,167
He has to give
the balance, fifty rupees.

383
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,417
Take it.

384
00:24:18,417 --> 00:24:20,167
(Indistinct voices)

385
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,667
I closed the shop an hour before.

386
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,542
Coming at eight o'clock
is earlier for you?

387
00:24:24,542 --> 00:24:26,083
Work is important.

388
00:24:26,083 --> 00:24:27,083
Shouldn't we need to earn
for survival?

389
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:28,292
I don't want this job.

390
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:29,750
I think, it's better to go
to my native place.

391
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,792
Are you a goof?

392
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:33,667
You're a free bird.

393
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:34,833
I'm not like that.

394
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,625
I must give my earnings to home.

395
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:40,042
Whatever I earn is not for me.

396
00:24:40,417 --> 00:24:44,333
She asked me whether I've recharged
for fifty rupees so far?

397
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:45,875
How much I've spent for her?

398
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:47,125
You spent by borrowing.

399
00:24:47,167 --> 00:24:48,250
Nothing.

400
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:50,292
I heard, what you said.

401
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:51,917
She is also right.

402
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,583
I'm in that stance only.

403
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,833
I envy the people who are rich.

404
00:24:56,417 --> 00:24:58,417
The disease which shouldn't
affect humans is frustration.

405
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,667
I got that disease.

406
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,708
It won't be good,
if I stay here after.

407
00:25:04,708 --> 00:25:07,875
(Indistinct voices)

408
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,958
Where you've to go?
-To Porur.

409
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:10,625
No...

410
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,875
Sister, why're you here?
-Ibrahim.

411
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,417
Come on,
I'll drop you in home.

412
00:25:18,417 --> 00:25:20,167
No. It's okay.
-I'll come by auto.

413
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,333
Sister, it's okay.

414
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:23,125
Come on.

415
00:25:23,542 --> 00:25:24,750
Sit carefully.

416
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:27,042
How is Kavitha's marriage arrangements
going on?

417
00:25:27,042 --> 00:25:31,458
Good.
I'm buying things for her dowry.

418
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
How many sovereigns of
gold are you giving?

419
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,083
Upto fifty sovereigns.

420
00:25:36,042 --> 00:25:37,417
I bought all the jewels.

421
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:40,042
I must keep all those
safely in the locker.

422
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,625
I've to give a life
to the blind girl.

423
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:44,417
Yes.

424
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,625
Don't you have night shift today?

425
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,708
Yes, that's where I was going on.

426
00:25:47,708 --> 00:25:52,417
As you're standing alone,
thought of leaving you in home.

427
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:53,167
Okay.

428
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:56,375
-oh, no.

429
00:25:56,375 --> 00:25:57,167
-see there.

430
00:25:57,167 --> 00:25:59,000
-get up.

431
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,000
Hey, why are you driving
in high speed?

432
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,750
Are you mindless?

433
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,583
Will you drive the vehicle, drunk?

434
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,208
Can't you see the vehicle
coming opposite to you?

435
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,792
Where are you looking at
and driving?

436
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:07,000
I'll kill you.

437
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You don't know to ride
the bike with a woman on pillion.

438
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,667
Come on, Ibrahim.

439
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:11,958
Get lost.
Else, I'll hit you.

440
00:26:12,333 --> 00:26:15,250
You keep talking tales
when driving.

441
00:26:15,292 --> 00:26:17,500
Then, quarrelling with others
blaming they've hit.

442
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:20,958
Reach home safely, wastrel.
- Hey, go away.

443
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,542
Don't fall again on
any other vehicle.

444
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:26,458
(Indistinct voices)

445
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:27,667
Don't blabber.

446
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:30,042
Aren't people who live like us
are humans?

447
00:26:30,083 --> 00:26:32,500
Everyone who lives here
has a secret behind them.

448
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,208
I'll tell you the information
which you aren't aware.

449
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:35,125
Listen.

450
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,875
The person who regularly have
watermelon juice in our shop,

451
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,583
The egghead?
-yes.

452
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,667
He left his cell phone
in the shop on that day.

453
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:45,958
Then, I was known that
he is a spy to the police.

454
00:26:59,083 --> 00:27:00,708
Sir, this book...

455
00:27:00,708 --> 00:27:02,667
You mean that book?

456
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:03,625
You keep it there.

457
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,292
You can't understand,
if you read.

458
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,792
Then, I ought to read this.

459
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,208
You mean, police?

460
00:27:08,208 --> 00:27:09,583
He is not the police.

461
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:11,792
He is a spy to the police.

462
00:27:11,792 --> 00:27:13,792
Each and everyone
has a face like that.

463
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,958
But for us?

464
00:27:18,625 --> 00:27:21,083
You're the tea master
and I squeeze juices.

465
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:21,833
That's all.

466
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:24,417
After my friendship
with the egghead,

467
00:27:24,417 --> 00:27:26,667
I've known, how the police
will deal the cases.

468
00:27:26,667 --> 00:27:29,750
(Indistinct voices)

469
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:32,125
The police personnel are very intelligent.

470
00:27:32,542 --> 00:27:33,750
Thank you very much.

471
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:34,375
It's okay, sister.

472
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:35,125
What's in this?

473
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh, no.

474
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:40,875
Ibrahim!
-Tell me, sister.

475
00:27:40,875 --> 00:27:42,167
My purse is not found.

476
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:44,625
I don't know whether it was
missed at the place where we fell.

477
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,417
Wait, I'll go and check.

478
00:27:50,042 --> 00:27:51,208
Saravanan, what I say?

479
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:52,958
I'm calling home.
Be silent.

480
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,458
Hello, Saravanan.

481
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,292
-are you fine?

482
00:27:55,333 --> 00:27:56,042
-Had food?

483
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,000
Yes, I had.

484
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:57,958
I'm coming tomorrow.

485
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,125
Cook something special for me.

486
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:00,667
Are you coming on leave?

487
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:02,542
No, I've decided to come
on the whole.

488
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:03,375
What?

489
00:28:03,375 --> 00:28:05,292
What's here for you
to come and stay?

490
00:28:05,333 --> 00:28:07,000
No need to come,
stay there.

491
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,250
Are you coming to roam
around with the wastrels?

492
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,375
What happened?
-Mom...

493
00:28:10,375 --> 00:28:11,792
He is quitting the job.

494
00:28:11,833 --> 00:28:12,375
Give me.

495
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,792
Saravanan.

496
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:15,833
Tell me, dad.

497
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,958
You've the responsibility
to uplift the family.

498
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,458
We're a respectable family.

499
00:28:20,083 --> 00:28:22,750
It's okay, if you come
to do my funeral rites.

500
00:28:22,792 --> 00:28:24,458
Dear, give me the phone.

501
00:28:25,375 --> 00:28:26,500
-Hello Saravanan.

502
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,417
-Are you hearing?

503
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:29,417
Tell me, mom.

504
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,125
-why do you want
to quit this job now?

505
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:33,833
-your sister is not yet married.

506
00:28:33,833 --> 00:28:36,000
-your dad is not well.

507
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,250
-stay on, atleast in a job.

508
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,042
Hey...
Why?

509
00:28:45,208 --> 00:28:46,250
Let's search.

510
00:29:10,375 --> 00:29:11,333
I got it.

511
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,750
Where I had thrown
and where are you searching?

512
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:15,125
He has thrown and hitting me.

513
00:29:15,125 --> 00:29:15,708
What?

514
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:17,250
Just asked whether we're having
food or going to room?

515
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,042
Come on.

516
00:29:18,875 --> 00:29:20,125
It seems to rain.

517
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:20,917
Come soon.

518
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:23,583
What do you want to eat?

519
00:29:24,042 --> 00:29:24,750
I don't want anything.

520
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:25,708
Let's go to the room soon.

521
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,167
Your's behaviour is bizarre.

522
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,542
Drunk from the morning
and broke the phone.

523
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:31,792
He's going...

524
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:33,583
Who's that?

525
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:36,667
Ibrahim.

526
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,083
Where?

527
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:43,000
Do you think me as a miser
like him?

528
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:44,875
I've money.

529
00:29:50,292 --> 00:29:51,417
Hey, Mani...

530
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:52,375
Tell me..

531
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:56,292
I think the fan may fall down.

532
00:29:57,875 --> 00:29:59,000
Why are you laughing?

533
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
It'll fall on either of our head.

534
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,667
If it falls today,
it might fall on either of our head.

535
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:05,875
If it falls tomorrow,
only you'll be here.

536
00:30:05,917 --> 00:30:07,375
I'm going to my home, tomorrow.

537
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:12,542
I've dried the clothes
on the terrace.

538
00:30:12,542 --> 00:30:14,917
Come, let's take.
-You go.

539
00:30:14,917 --> 00:30:16,875
I'll hold the fan,
if it falls.

540
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:21,625
He is taking my life, drunk.

541
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,167
Mani...
-sister.

542
00:30:28,042 --> 00:30:29,375
I've dried the mat
on the terrace.

543
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,042
Will you please bring it?
- Okay, sister.

544
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:45,125
You're talking without responsibility?

545
00:30:45,417 --> 00:30:48,542
Simply saying that you went along
with Ibrahim and lost the bureau key.

546
00:30:49,667 --> 00:30:50,042
Sister...

547
00:30:50,042 --> 00:30:52,042
He searched for it.

548
00:30:52,042 --> 00:30:52,875
But, not found.

549
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:54,542
There is another key.

550
00:30:54,792 --> 00:30:58,000
Anyway, we'll keep the jewelry
in the bank locker on Monday.

551
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,542
Leave it.

552
00:30:58,542 --> 00:31:00,000
You're careless in everything.

553
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,250
I'm doing everything alone.

554
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,542
You'll keep poking.

555
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,042
Sister...

556
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:05,542
I'm coming.

557
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:11,125
Thank you very much.

558
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,250
Saravanan.

559
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,417
Oh, he is clear now.

560
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:19,292
What are you doing?

561
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:23,042
Black tea and cigarette
for this rain will be rocking.

562
00:31:23,042 --> 00:31:23,792
Have it.

563
00:31:23,792 --> 00:31:25,417
It's your preparation,
you'll praise it..

564
00:31:26,917 --> 00:31:29,292
Hey, isn't it Ibrahim's shirt?

565
00:31:29,292 --> 00:31:30,250
Leave it on the terrace.

566
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,167
Let it get wet in the rain.

567
00:31:31,167 --> 00:31:32,292
Do yourself.

568
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,875
Am I an assistant to everyone?

569
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,792
Here, you ask me
to do the works.

570
00:31:38,042 --> 00:31:40,042
If I go upstairs,
the owner asks me something to do.

571
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,292
She was blabbering
that key is lost.

572
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,500
Then, she might ask me
to search for that too.

573
00:31:45,417 --> 00:31:46,167
Hey...

574
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
What key is that?

575
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,792
She was talking about
the bureau key.

576
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,042
Tell me exactly,
what they were talking?

577
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:15,542
Is it her's?

578
00:32:15,542 --> 00:32:16,292
May be.

579
00:32:17,417 --> 00:32:18,500
Shall we give it?

580
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:21,542
But, if she asks for the money
in the purse, what to say?

581
00:32:23,792 --> 00:32:25,375
Is this you're worried about?

582
00:32:25,375 --> 00:32:26,792
I'm thinking differently.

583
00:32:27,875 --> 00:32:30,917
So, we've just one day.

584
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,167
Saravanan, are you thinking
anything wrong?

585
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,375
Then, give this to her.

586
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:39,667
You're thinking about something,
what's that?

587
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:42,667
What you're thinking with
fear and nervousness...

588
00:32:42,667 --> 00:32:45,042
...I'm thinking the same
with ease and patience.

589
00:32:53,875 --> 00:32:56,042
Hey, are we going to loot?

590
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,750
No. It's risky.

591
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:03,542
If it's not their key?

592
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,917
I'm asking you.

593
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:20,542
When we came by walk,
Ibrahim was going opposite of us.

594
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,917
He might've gone
in search of the key.

595
00:33:23,917 --> 00:33:25,167
Then, he would've seen us.

596
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,542
He might know
that we took the purse.

597
00:33:28,542 --> 00:33:29,667
You didn't see him.

598
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:30,792
I told you.

599
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:32,917
Likewise, he would've left
without noticing us.

600
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:35,500
Though he has seen, it's just
we're coming to the room by walk.

601
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,375
That's all.

602
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,042
You don't afraid of him.

603
00:33:39,042 --> 00:33:41,500
I'm just thinking of a plan
getting him involved.

604
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,292
I can't understand.

605
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,292
Ibrahim took the lost key.

606
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:46,917
But, he didn't give it
to the owner.

607
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:50,542
No one knows about the lost key.

608
00:33:50,542 --> 00:33:55,000
We'll escape letting Ibrahim to get
caught in this case, if the police inquires.

609
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,042
That is, we'll make the police intelligent
and then as fools.

610
00:33:58,042 --> 00:33:59,917
Take Ibrahim's shirt.

611
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,667
What are you going to do?

612
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:17,667
Generally, the police will find
theft cases with small hints.

613
00:34:17,667 --> 00:34:19,917
We'll give the evidence.

614
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:25,125
The theft case without breaking
the bureau lock.

615
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:27,292
This will be the flash news.

616
00:34:28,417 --> 00:34:32,000
When investigated, If the owner
complaint about her lost key,

617
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,125
Ibrahim's collar button and the thread,
everything will match perfectly.

618
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:39,167
Are you thinking
how to take it?

619
00:34:39,167 --> 00:34:40,500
Have you decided to take it?

620
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,875
Then give the key, Go.

621
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,667
Okay, tell me.

622
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:47,917
On Monday, with the spare key,
she'll keep the jewelry in the bank locker.

623
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:49,292
Hey, just a minute.

624
00:34:49,292 --> 00:34:52,250
How does Ibrahim know
that the jewels are in the bureau?

625
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,917
Thoughtful question.

626
00:34:54,875 --> 00:35:00,167
The owner might've told
about the importance of the lost key.

627
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,167
Okay, leave it.

628
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03,417
The police will inquire him
about that.

629
00:35:03,417 --> 00:35:04,500
Why should we bother?

630
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:08,667
Hey, we kept the new bureau.

631
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:09,917
If she had changed
the jewelry to that bureau?

632
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:11,250
No chance, Mani.

633
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,875
We kept the handle of the bureau
towards the wall, do you remember?

634
00:35:13,875 --> 00:35:16,250
She'll keep the jewelry
in the bank locker on Monday.

635
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,875
Just for one day
she won't shift the jewelry.

636
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:19,792
That's okay.

637
00:35:19,792 --> 00:35:21,042
But, how to take it?

638
00:35:23,125 --> 00:35:24,417
When she is not at home.

639
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:27,167
She goes to temple everyday
at 5 to 6 o'clock in the evening.

640
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:29,042
At that time only.

641
00:35:29,042 --> 00:35:31,000
What about that blind girl?

642
00:35:32,625 --> 00:35:34,667
We aren't going to break it,
just going to open.

643
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:38,875
Selvam brother too can't move
from the bed.

644
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:40,667
Let's manage.

645
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:45,167
Though we take,
where to keep it.

646
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:57,292
A bike theft case, Mani.
I've read about it.

647
00:35:57,292 --> 00:36:00,792
The thief changed the number plate
of the bike and left it in the bike stand.

648
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:04,042
After few days, he took that bike
and left in another bike stand.

649
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:07,250
He used the bike after the case
was shifted to other stance.

650
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:12,167
When he was caught in another case
this bike matter was revealed.

651
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:14,875
We're also going to follow
the same.

652
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:17,292
There are cloak rooms
in the bus depot. isn't it?

653
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:18,125
Yes.

654
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,667
We'll keep the jewelry safely there.

655
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,000
Then, after few days
we'll shift to another bus depot.

656
00:36:24,542 --> 00:36:26,292
What you say seems
to be very risky.

657
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:35,042
When thinking about
this disturbing noise of the fan...

658
00:36:35,042 --> 00:36:36,417
...we can't sleep, Mani.

659
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:40,417
We can't live,
if we're afraid of everything.

660
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:43,042
It's a luck for us now.

661
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,417
I think, we must utilise it.

662
00:36:44,917 --> 00:36:45,917
What do you say?

663
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:47,125
Greedy.

664
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:50,792
The people who are greedy must get destroyed.

665
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:53,292
Why?

666
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:56,542
Already, it's cold because of rain.

667
00:36:56,542 --> 00:36:58,250
I can't sleep with fear
under this fan.

668
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:00,917
We'll go out tomorrow morning,
As soon as we get up.

669
00:37:00,917 --> 00:37:04,167
We shouldn't see the owner till evening.

670
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:07,417
We shouldn't be aware about the
lost keys through her.

671
00:37:08,167 --> 00:37:09,542
No need to go to the shop.

672
00:37:09,542 --> 00:37:11,125
Ask the boss for leave.

673
00:37:11,125 --> 00:37:14,042
Won't you change in the morning,
all these you've planned citing as inebriated?

674
00:37:14,042 --> 00:37:15,417
I won't.

675
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:28,375
If I sit over and think,
It's like I am spoiling my life.

676
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:40,250
Hey, why are you afraid of her?

677
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,042
She is a member in
the women's society, isn't it?

678
00:37:42,042 --> 00:37:42,375
Yes.

679
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,500
She was burning an effigy on that day.

680
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,875
When inquired, she said
that actor used filthy words in his film.

681
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:52,167
I asked her, even your husband
speaks filthy everyday, coming home drunk.

682
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:53,625
Can't you burn his effigy?

683
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,042
What you asked is right.

684
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,750
Is it right?

685
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,417
From then onwards,
she is starring at me.

686
00:37:59,417 --> 00:38:01,167
Probably, she will burn my effigy.

687
00:38:01,167 --> 00:38:03,292
Mani, We are just puppets
in this society.

688
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:05,250
To be an effigy
we must be rich.

689
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,000
I envy the people who're rich.

690
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,375
The disease which shouldn't affect
the human is frustration.

691
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,542
Two idlis.
For you?

692
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:18,792
Why the old film is screened?

693
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:21,417
Only old films were screened.

694
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:22,750
Mani, one more thing.

695
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:23,917
If we stay away for long,
we'll get caught.

696
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:25,250
Even if we stay close also, we'll get caught.

697
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,042
Be careful

698
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,625
Is all these necessary for us?

699
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:42,792
I'm afraid.

700
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:47,542
Would you like this film,
if the hero utilises the chance he gets?

701
00:38:47,542 --> 00:38:50,042
Or not using, out of fear?

702
00:38:50,042 --> 00:38:51,625
Are we heroes?

703
00:38:51,625 --> 00:38:55,000
I don't know about you.
But, I'm the hero for myself...

704
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,375
It's a shame if we get caught, isn't it?

705
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:07,417
Everyone will look at me
with disgust.

706
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:15,542
A person will be seen normal,
until he comes up in life.

707
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,292
-Do you need lentil snacks?

708
00:39:19,125 --> 00:39:21,667
If he comes up
with his hard work,

709
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:24,042
Everyone will talk about
his caste and religion...

710
00:39:24,042 --> 00:39:26,500
...instead of his achievements.

711
00:39:28,917 --> 00:39:33,792
Not only that,
he'll be separated linguistically.

712
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:37,542
How hard you come high in life,
these people will odd.

713
00:39:40,792 --> 00:39:42,417
If we've to come up,

714
00:39:42,417 --> 00:39:44,667
It's not wrong to do something
beyond our limits, Mani.

715
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:53,167
After decided to commit mistake,

716
00:39:53,167 --> 00:39:55,292
Kavitha's blindness,

717
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:57,792
Selvam's paralysis...

718
00:39:57,792 --> 00:40:00,667
...all these weakness
seems to be strengths.

719
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:04,667
God will watch us,
whatever we do.

720
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,500
That god would've seen us
when struggling for food.

721
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,042
Let him see.

722
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:21,917
Hello, mom.

723
00:40:21,917 --> 00:40:23,750
Saravanan...
-tell me, mom.

724
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:26,875
Your sister went for the tailoring class.

725
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:29,250
She wasn't back to home.

726
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:32,417
Everyone gossips that
she had eloped with someone.

727
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:33,542
What are you saying, mom?

728
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:35,417
Hey, reduce the volume.

729
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:40,792
Your dad got heart attack on hearing that.
-what happened?

730
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:43,750
Taking him to the hospital now.
-Don't cry, mom.

731
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:45,292
Are the guys there for help?

732
00:40:45,292 --> 00:40:48,292
Yes, Ravi is here.
-give the phone to him.

733
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:49,542
I'll give.

734
00:40:49,542 --> 00:40:50,750
Speak to him.
- Give me, mom.

735
00:40:51,417 --> 00:40:52,542
Dear...

736
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:53,792
Hello, tell me dude.

737
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:56,792
Take care of him.
-Okay dude, you start immediately.

738
00:40:57,667 --> 00:40:58,375
He'll come mom.

739
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,625
Is he coming?
- Yes.

740
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:04,792
Oh, no! What are you saying?

741
00:41:05,917 --> 00:41:07,792
If the marriage doesn't occur
at certain age, this will happen.

742
00:41:07,792 --> 00:41:09,125
Wonder, you're saying it so normal.

743
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,500
Then, you want me
to weep like my mom.

744
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:13,917
I'm leaving.

745
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,542
First, throw away that key.

746
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,042
Nothing is good,
right from the time we took it.

747
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:35,375
Brother
- Sister.

748
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:36,667
We're going to temple.

749
00:41:36,667 --> 00:41:37,500
Pooja at temple.

750
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,125
Both you and Saravanan
come over there.

751
00:41:39,125 --> 00:41:41,042
Sister, Saravanan's father got
heart attack.

752
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:42,292
Just now we got a call.

753
00:41:42,542 --> 00:41:43,375
Oh, no!

754
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,667
Just now Mani told us.

755
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,625
Don't be panic.

756
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:49,542
Don't worry, Saravanan.

757
00:41:49,542 --> 00:41:50,792
Nothing will happen.

758
00:41:50,792 --> 00:41:53,042
Okay, you go immediately.

759
00:41:53,792 --> 00:41:55,042
Send him by bus.

760
00:41:55,042 --> 00:41:56,042
If possible, come to temple.

761
00:41:56,042 --> 00:41:56,625
Come on...

762
00:41:59,417 --> 00:42:01,125
Hey, wait...
I'll get the lock and key.

763
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:41,292
Hey...

764
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,125
Hello...

765
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,167
Open the bag.

766
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:33,667
Hurry up.

767
00:44:38,333 --> 00:44:39,333
What?

768
00:44:39,375 --> 00:44:40,250
Your father is dead.

769
00:45:02,375 --> 00:45:03,250
Lineage is Shivam.

770
00:45:04,625 --> 00:45:05,958
Kavitha...
Star is Ashwini.

771
00:45:05,958 --> 00:45:09,083
Zodiac sign is Aries.

772
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:09,750
Sister...

773
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:11,750
Come on, Mani.

774
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:13,000
Just a minute.

775
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
That's all, Swamy.

776
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,500
Have you sent off Saravanan?

777
00:45:18,875 --> 00:45:20,375
Yes, as soon as you left.

778
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:21,750
I left him for bus at Koyambedu.

779
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:22,458
Okay.

780
00:45:22,875 --> 00:45:24,000
Saravanan's father has expired.

781
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:24,875
Oh, no!

782
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,125
What?

783
00:45:27,125 --> 00:45:30,458
Got the phone call
when on the way to bus stand.

784
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:32,583
Sister, what happened?

785
00:45:33,125 --> 00:45:34,875
Saravanan's father has expired.

786
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:36,708
Godess,

787
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,458
Lakshmi, come here.

788
00:45:39,458 --> 00:45:40,333
Coming.

789
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,833
We'll finish the pooja and come.

790
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:45,000
Come.

791
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,500
God!

792
00:46:09,458 --> 00:46:11,000
Sister, don't worry.

793
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,125
It'll be found.

794
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:16,125
Do you know who is the thief?

795
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,083
There only.

796
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:19,000
I know.

797
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,083
Thief only.

798
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:25,833
Come.

799
00:46:25,833 --> 00:46:27,208
Everything is gone.

800
00:46:27,208 --> 00:46:28,875
Better die.

801
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,333
Get me some poison.

802
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
I'll also die.

803
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:36,625
I have it,
ask me if you want.

804
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:37,875
Shut up.

805
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:39,833
Brother, why are you talking so?

806
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41,375
We've informed the police.

807
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:42,625
They'll find it out.

808
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:44,125
Mani, I've informed the channel.

809
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:45,083
They're coming.

810
00:46:45,083 --> 00:46:46,000
Wear a good shirt.

811
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,708
Cable TV?

812
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:53,875
Hey, Saravanan...

813
00:46:56,375 --> 00:46:58,958
See your father!

814
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:05,333
Saravanan, you've to do the rituals.

815
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,333
Get your clothes changed.

816
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:21,958
It's not like broken theft.

817
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:25,417
Is the key with you?

818
00:47:26,458 --> 00:47:28,958
Got a colored thread and button.

819
00:47:28,958 --> 00:47:30,583
Is there only one key
for this bureau?

820
00:47:30,583 --> 00:47:35,458
No, the other key was lost
on Saturday night when coming by bike.

821
00:47:46,083 --> 00:47:48,583
Sivagami, your daughter has come.

822
00:47:55,333 --> 00:47:57,042
Hey, you...

823
00:47:57,042 --> 00:47:58,208
Why did you come here?

824
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,958
How dare you've come?

825
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:00,958
Look what I'm going to do to you.

826
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:02,083
Mom...

827
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:02,958
Why did you come here?

828
00:48:02,958 --> 00:48:03,792
You spoilt...
-mom.

829
00:48:03,792 --> 00:48:05,542
It's because of you.
-fighting on the streets...

830
00:48:05,542 --> 00:48:06,833
-Hey,
-Saravanan.

831
00:48:06,833 --> 00:48:07,792
Leave her.
-look at the rites...

832
00:48:07,792 --> 00:48:08,833
We'll talk later.

833
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:09,542
Leave, mom.

834
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:11,083
Are you out of your mind?
Move away.

835
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:12,792
Why are you shouting?

836
00:48:12,792 --> 00:48:14,208
Get her inside.

837
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,042
Hey, the one who died
is my husband.

838
00:48:16,042 --> 00:48:16,667
Get lost.

839
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:18,208
You be quiet, uncle.

840
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:19,292
Hey, I keep saying...

841
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:20,292
Come on.

842
00:48:20,958 --> 00:48:22,333
Dad!

843
00:48:28,083 --> 00:48:28,708
Sir...

844
00:48:28,958 --> 00:48:30,458
Sir, what are you doing?

845
00:48:30,833 --> 00:48:31,708
Hey, come.

846
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:32,833
Sir, please.

847
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:33,833
May I know the reason?

848
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:34,792
Shut your mouth.

849
00:48:37,583 --> 00:48:39,917
The key was lost
when going along with you.

850
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,042
You found it.

851
00:48:41,042 --> 00:48:41,458
Sir...

852
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:44,667
Last evening, the jewels were there,
when they left to temple.

853
00:48:44,667 --> 00:48:46,542
You stayed back,
saying you're not well...

854
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:48,583
...and took away the jewels
when no one is there.

855
00:48:48,583 --> 00:48:50,167
Sir, really I'm not well yesterday.

856
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:51,292
Do you have the doctor certificate?

857
00:48:51,292 --> 00:48:53,083
Sir, that's a simple headache.

858
00:48:54,458 --> 00:48:57,083
I thought, you'll say
some other reason.

859
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:58,083
I'm a Muslim.

860
00:48:58,083 --> 00:48:59,833
That's why,
I didn't go to temple.

861
00:49:00,292 --> 00:49:02,208
Sir, I'm not that sort of person.

862
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:04,833
I'll show you in the police station
what sort I'm .

863
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:06,417
Hey, take him.

864
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:07,833
Come....

865
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,583
This is the talent of the
Tamil Nadu police!

866
00:49:09,583 --> 00:49:12,208
They caught the thief
in half an hour.

867
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,292
No one is there, sir.

868
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:14,458
What are you looking at?

869
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:15,208
Whose room is that?

870
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,333
His room.

871
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:17,917
Hey, come here.

872
00:49:17,917 --> 00:49:18,208
Sir...

873
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:18,958
What's your name?

874
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:19,917
Manikandan, sir.

875
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:21,958
Is Ibrahim your friend?

876
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:22,542
No, sir.

877
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:23,667
He stays in the next room.

878
00:49:23,667 --> 00:49:24,083
That's all.

879
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:25,917
What is your job?

880
00:49:25,917 --> 00:49:26,917
I'm the tea master.

881
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:28,917
Didn't you go for the job?

882
00:49:29,708 --> 00:49:31,542
I have to go.
It's already late.

883
00:49:31,542 --> 00:49:32,417
Are you staying alone?

884
00:49:32,417 --> 00:49:33,083
No, sir.

885
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:34,417
Saravanan is here.

886
00:49:34,417 --> 00:49:35,583
Both of them work together.

887
00:49:35,583 --> 00:49:37,708
Hey, will you get into the vehicle.
-no, sir.

888
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:38,708
Shut up.

889
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,333
I didn't say anything.

890
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:42,958
My friend, Saravanan is here.

891
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:45,333
He went to his native
as his father was expired.

892
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:46,583
When did he go?

893
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:50,958
Last evening, sir.
-police can smoke.

894
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,792
Didn't you go for your friend's
father death?

895
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:55,542
No, sir.

896
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:58,042
Someone must be in the shop.

897
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,458
Dad!

898
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:13,458
Dad!

899
00:50:19,792 --> 00:50:24,833
Dad, why did you leave us?

900
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:28,542
Anyway, you shouldn't have
done this, sister.

901
00:50:28,542 --> 00:50:30,208
You traitor...

902
00:50:30,208 --> 00:50:32,583
Don't hit her.

903
00:50:36,542 --> 00:50:39,042
Sir, I'm speaking from the spot.

904
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:39,542
Tell me.

905
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:41,042
His father has died.

906
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:43,333
Some other problem
is going on in home .

907
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,458
Leave her.

908
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,333
Whatever, let's talk later.

909
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:49,042
Shall I inquire, sir?

910
00:50:49,042 --> 00:50:49,708
No...

911
00:50:50,417 --> 00:50:51,208
I'll take care.

912
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,333
If necessary,
I'll tell you.

913
00:50:54,667 --> 00:50:56,042
We caught the accused.

914
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,458
I'll call you,
if necessary.

915
00:51:03,375 --> 00:51:06,958
As soon as your friend comes,
both of you must come to the station.

916
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:30,208
(Chanting Mantras)

917
00:51:49,583 --> 00:51:50,292
Hey...

918
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:54,667
Why didn't you switch on the fan?

919
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,208
That is...

920
00:51:56,208 --> 00:51:56,958
Leave that.

921
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:59,000
I was almost dead for a week.

922
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I got fever because of fear.

923
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:00,917
Touch me.

924
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:04,125
I was feared that
everyone looks at me dubious.

925
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:07,000
As you said, Ibrahim was arrested
on suspicion.

926
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:10,542
But, I think his uncle
has political influence.

927
00:52:10,542 --> 00:52:13,250
He came out within a day,
don't know whether FIR was filed.

928
00:52:13,250 --> 00:52:14,625
He has vacated the room too.

929
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:17,833
It was flashed in news
as the job of a new burglary clan.

930
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:19,458
I keep talking.

931
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:21,250
Don't you've an eagerness to know
what happened for a week?

932
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,250
Did I ask you?

933
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:23,375
It's you saying everything.

934
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:26,792
Okay, is the jewelry safe
in the cloak room?

935
00:52:26,792 --> 00:52:27,625
No, Mani.

936
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:29,917
I thought there
might be problem in that.

937
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:33,167
So, I kept it safely in the place
where rituals done to my father.

938
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,792
Okay, but, why my phone?

939
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:44,417
I would've switched off
the phone, isn't it?

940
00:52:45,417 --> 00:52:46,250
You?

941
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,042
You can't do, Mani.

942
00:52:59,917 --> 00:53:01,083
That owner...

943
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,625
We must've thought about it
before looting.

944
00:53:02,625 --> 00:53:04,458
Now thinking as pityful
is a great pity.

945
00:53:05,042 --> 00:53:06,750
I didn't think as pityful.

946
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,125
Are you thinking so?

947
00:53:08,917 --> 00:53:11,708
No... nothing like that.

948
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:17,000
What's that you were about to ask?

949
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,333
She might increase the rent
citing the reason of lost jewelry.

950
00:53:20,333 --> 00:53:21,042
That's why.

951
00:53:27,083 --> 00:53:30,000
Hey, I forgot to tell
an important information.

952
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,208
As soon as you come back,
we were asked to come to the police station.

953
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,167
Should we go compulsory?

954
00:53:33,167 --> 00:53:34,250
Yes, we must definitely go.

955
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:35,708
Else, they'll suspect us.

956
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:39,375
I thought I'll be arrested
along with Ibrahim, on that day.

957
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,417
But, we were spared, thinking that
we wouldn't have stolen...

958
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:42,917
...as you went to native
for father's demise.

959
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:44,958
Better, you keep starring.

960
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:45,708
I must go to work in the morning.

961
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:46,458
I'll sleep.

962
00:53:51,333 --> 00:53:52,708
Lot of problems in house.

963
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,625
The guy who eloped with my sister...

964
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:56,583
...his family is yet to accept them.

965
00:53:56,583 --> 00:53:58,333
Both of them are staying
in our house.

966
00:53:59,125 --> 00:54:00,667
My sister is conceived too.

967
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:02,875
Only now she eloped, right?

968
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:06,708
Congratulations!

969
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:07,458
You've become an uncle!

970
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:13,458
Greetings, sir.

971
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:17,375
When were you back?

972
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:18,542
Last night, sir.

973
00:54:19,417 --> 00:54:20,667
How did your mother die?

974
00:54:20,667 --> 00:54:21,250
Sir!

975
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,708
How did your mother die?

976
00:54:22,708 --> 00:54:24,542
Sir, not mother,
his father has expired.

977
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:27,208
You said as his mother, then.

978
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:28,208
My father, sir.

979
00:54:28,208 --> 00:54:29,167
He died of heart attack.

980
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:34,625
We tracked the voice of
few cell numbers, regarding this case.

981
00:54:34,625 --> 00:54:37,417
He got a call from your number.

982
00:54:37,417 --> 00:54:38,625
But, he didn't attend.

983
00:54:39,208 --> 00:54:42,083
Then, you didn't call him again.

984
00:54:42,083 --> 00:54:45,083
You got call from him
and some other numbers.

985
00:54:45,083 --> 00:54:46,167
You didn't attend at all.

986
00:54:46,167 --> 00:54:46,917
Why?

987
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:47,875
Hey...

988
00:54:48,208 --> 00:54:49,667
My phone was lost, sir.

989
00:54:49,667 --> 00:54:50,833
I didn't know were i kept.

990
00:54:50,833 --> 00:54:51,542
Ring is going on.

991
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:52,583
But, no one attends.

992
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:54,167
I even tried from other numbers.

993
00:54:54,167 --> 00:54:55,750
But, no one is attending, sir.

994
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:57,042
I don't know where it is.

995
00:54:57,042 --> 00:55:00,000
I was known that his phone
got lost only when I called the owner.

996
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Mani?
-yes, boss.

997
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:01,958
He is here.
-give him.

998
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:02,708
Give him.
-Mani.

999
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:03,875
Boss
- Phone.

1000
00:55:06,542 --> 00:55:08,458
Saravanan, I ate.

1001
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,250
How about you?

1002
00:55:20,292 --> 00:55:22,000
I couldn't hear anything because of
the travel noise...

1003
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,750
...on that evening, when I called.

1004
00:55:25,417 --> 00:55:27,792
After getting this month salary,
I've to buy a new phone.

1005
00:55:28,208 --> 00:55:31,833
I'll give you the number
as soon as I buy the new one.

1006
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:34,333
What's the name of that muslim guy?

1007
00:55:34,333 --> 00:55:35,208
Ibrahim.

1008
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,667
He was relieved in bail.

1009
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:41,083
Else, I would've peeled off his skin.

1010
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:45,000
The losers of the jewellery
is not keen on this case.

1011
00:55:45,417 --> 00:55:49,500
If we get any pressure,
I won't talk with you in this module.

1012
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,375
You must come to the police station
whenever called.

1013
00:55:51,375 --> 00:55:52,042
Go...

1014
00:55:52,667 --> 00:55:53,250
Hey...

1015
00:55:55,958 --> 00:56:00,792
Later, you must give your new
contact number and your owner's number.

1016
00:56:00,792 --> 00:56:01,458
Okay, sir.

1017
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:02,500
Okay, leave now.

1018
00:56:05,458 --> 00:56:06,292
I'm leaving, sir.

1019
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:11,208
Take that phone.

1020
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:12,500
This costs one thousand
and four hundred rupees.

1021
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:14,833
Is it okay for you?

1022
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:17,083
What?

1023
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:17,833
You're rocking.

1024
00:56:22,625 --> 00:56:23,542
Give me your phone.

1025
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:24,958
Why?

1026
00:56:24,958 --> 00:56:25,875
Give me, i ll tell you later.

1027
00:56:27,625 --> 00:56:28,500
Let it be with me.

1028
00:56:28,875 --> 00:56:30,917
When you call the shop owner,

1029
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:32,417
you talk in my presence.

1030
00:56:32,417 --> 00:56:34,333
Only then, you won't blabber anything.

1031
00:56:34,792 --> 00:56:36,625
Give the number to the police,
if asked.

1032
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:38,208
I'll tell you the rest, later.

1033
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:52,417
I would've switched off
the phone, isn't it?

1034
00:56:53,167 --> 00:56:53,917
You...?

1035
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,875
You can't, Mani.

1036
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,333
Definitely, you'll blabber
if you get a call.

1037
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,667
Have you tried calling your number?

1038
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:00,250
No.

1039
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,792
I didn't switch off your phone.

1040
00:57:01,792 --> 00:57:04,292
When the police tracks the calls
of your phone,

1041
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:06,625
Only the call you made
on that evening will be there.

1042
00:57:06,625 --> 00:57:08,167
I didn't attend that too.

1043
00:57:08,167 --> 00:57:09,542
How will I call you?

1044
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:10,792
The phone is with you, right?

1045
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,208
I called.

1046
00:57:20,417 --> 00:57:21,750
Why all these?

1047
00:57:23,667 --> 00:57:27,083
If you've said the number,
their suspicious would've been more.

1048
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,000
Thats why,
I asked you to give.

1049
00:57:28,833 --> 00:57:31,792
They'll plan to track the calls,
only when the phone is working.

1050
00:57:31,792 --> 00:57:32,417
Let them do.

1051
00:57:33,625 --> 00:57:35,083
If they ask you
about this tomorrow,

1052
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:37,000
Tell them, my phone was lost,
I tried till yesterday...

1053
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:39,125
...the ring was going on.

1054
00:57:39,125 --> 00:57:41,292
From last night,
it was switched off.

1055
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:45,000
Either the charge must be dried
or switched off by the one who took it.

1056
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,750
Okay?

1057
00:57:47,417 --> 00:57:49,667
Just now,
I threw your phone.

1058
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,292
It was there only.

1059
00:57:51,292 --> 00:57:52,458
No one took it.

1060
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:57,875
Mani, we must let the police
to do their job.

1061
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:00,292
To show his intelligence,

1062
00:58:00,292 --> 00:58:04,000
If we give the questions on our own
and if we give the right answers too...

1063
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,167
...he can't even touch us.

1064
00:58:06,167 --> 00:58:10,083
I was awaiting for tracking
of our calls.

1065
00:58:16,208 --> 00:58:18,583
I was afraid, that you might get
angry when the police slapped me.

1066
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:19,875
You mean, angry?

1067
00:58:19,875 --> 00:58:21,042
I felt funny.

1068
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:24,708
Making the weak to get trapped
is the trick here.

1069
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,750
If they get a single evidence,
they'll bang us.

1070
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,958
That too, you'll blabber everything
when you're hit four times.

1071
00:58:30,958 --> 00:58:32,792
I can't even bear two.

1072
00:58:32,792 --> 00:58:34,125
What's the other evidence?

1073
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:35,250
It's there, Mani.

1074
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,375
Think well.

1075
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:40,750
If they get two things,
we'll be imprisoned.

1076
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:42,125
Hey...

1077
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:42,750
Hey...

1078
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:43,625
Is it finger prints?

1079
00:58:45,792 --> 00:58:47,792
On that day, they took finger prints
on the bureau.

1080
00:58:47,792 --> 00:58:50,167
Hey, I did everything
with the handkerchief.

1081
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:55,000
Not only that, hand prints of
the owner and others might be there.

1082
00:58:55,708 --> 00:58:56,708
It's different.

1083
00:59:00,208 --> 00:59:01,375
You got it?

1084
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:02,042
No, I don't know.

1085
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,833
If you think well,

1086
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:07,417
The police might ask, why we didn't open
the shop on the day of theft?

1087
00:59:07,417 --> 00:59:08,250
What'll you say?

1088
00:59:10,750 --> 00:59:11,833
You say that too.

1089
00:59:13,208 --> 00:59:14,500
We can manage even that.

1090
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,583
One more thing.

1091
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,375
One who knows well about
that house alone can do this.

1092
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:20,500
Selvam, who lies inside...

1093
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,958
...If a new person enters the house,
will the bureau be visible...

1094
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:25,083
...from the place where he is lying,

1095
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:28,583
whether he walks or not is not known.

1096
00:59:28,583 --> 00:59:32,208
It can be done by the one,
well versed about the house.

1097
00:59:32,667 --> 00:59:35,375
If they investigate that way,
we both will be in the list.

1098
00:59:38,542 --> 00:59:39,750
Don't get perplexed.

1099
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,208
There is a limit to get caught.

1100
00:59:41,458 --> 00:59:43,250
But limitless ways to escape.

1101
00:59:43,875 --> 00:59:46,375
He can allow us to open the shop
post lunch after 3'o clock.

1102
00:59:46,375 --> 00:59:47,417
He is asking us to open by 2.

1103
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,542
Hello.
-Saravanan, where are you?

1104
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:52,167
I'm in the room, sister.
-will you please come upstairs?

1105
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:53,167
I'm coming.

1106
00:59:54,583 --> 00:59:55,167
You get in.

1107
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:55,792
I'll come.

1108
01:00:05,583 --> 01:00:06,292
Come.

1109
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:08,333
Be seated.

1110
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,542
I couldn't even call to inquire
about your father's demise.

1111
01:00:17,542 --> 01:00:19,042
Problems mounted here.

1112
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:21,208
Hope you'd have known.

1113
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,500
Yes, sister.

1114
01:00:23,292 --> 01:00:25,167
Is everyone in home better?

1115
01:00:25,583 --> 01:00:26,750
How is your mother?

1116
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:28,708
She is okay.

1117
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,875
See my life!

1118
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:40,708
I eloped from my house trusting him.

1119
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,917
My father died of heart attack
as soon as he knew that.

1120
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:05,208
Mom.

1121
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:06,375
Be quiet.

1122
01:01:07,917 --> 01:01:09,625
I'm blabbering to my brother.

1123
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,333
I was not even allowed
for the death.

1124
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:17,833
My brother Kathir took us home later.

1125
01:01:22,833 --> 01:01:24,750
He helped me to settle down.

1126
01:01:31,375 --> 01:01:33,375
Saravanan,
-yes, tell me.

1127
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:36,792
My brother, Kathir is in Singapore for job.

1128
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:38,792
He is coming tomorrow.

1129
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:40,458
He is an enraged person.

1130
01:01:40,833 --> 01:01:42,667
He shouted to the extreme on phone.

1131
01:01:43,458 --> 01:01:48,958
If he speaks anything harsh tomorrow,
please don't take it to the heart.

1132
01:01:48,958 --> 01:01:50,542
Inform Mani also.

1133
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:52,125
That's why, I called you.

1134
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:54,917
Okay, sister.

1135
01:01:56,958 --> 01:01:59,792
I eloped from my house trusting him.

1136
01:01:59,792 --> 01:02:02,667
My father died of heart attack
as soon as he knew that.

1137
01:02:08,833 --> 01:02:09,625
Mani...

1138
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:11,083
Hey, Mani.

1139
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:14,417
Where is the book and paper
I kept here?

1140
01:02:15,542 --> 01:02:16,750
I've cleared off those things.

1141
01:02:20,417 --> 01:02:23,542
Does anyone other than you know
that my sister eloped?

1142
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:24,667
No.

1143
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:26,708
Only the demise of
your father was known.

1144
01:02:26,917 --> 01:02:27,542
Why?

1145
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:28,958
Nothing.

1146
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:32,542
Hey, what's the owner
was asking about?

1147
01:02:32,542 --> 01:02:34,458
She inquired about my father's demise.

1148
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,333
Saravanan, a water melon juice.

1149
01:03:21,208 --> 01:03:22,750
Okay, thank you.

1150
01:03:23,417 --> 01:03:23,917
Sir...

1151
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:24,458
Tell me.

1152
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:28,167
My house owner's jewelry
is stolen.

1153
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,083
You too say often,

1154
01:03:30,083 --> 01:03:32,125
When the police
can't find the lost jewelry,

1155
01:03:32,125 --> 01:03:33,875
They'll settle in another way.

1156
01:03:33,875 --> 01:03:34,417
Be seated.

1157
01:03:34,917 --> 01:03:35,417
Sir.

1158
01:03:35,833 --> 01:03:36,958
Be seated.

1159
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:45,542
That guy told that you went home
last week as your father expired.

1160
01:03:45,542 --> 01:03:48,667
Everything happens
in a wrong way here.

1161
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,250
If you ask someone the same query,
unnecessarily, you'll be in suspicion.

1162
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:57,792
Inspector Eshwar, is investigating
this case, isn't it?

1163
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,708
Yes, sir.

1164
01:03:58,708 --> 01:03:59,708
He is worst.

1165
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:00,833
He doesn't think much.

1166
01:04:00,833 --> 01:04:04,625
He won't proceed the case
unless he's pressurised.

1167
01:04:04,625 --> 01:04:07,625
If he has to proceed,
he'll imprison the people like you...

1168
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:11,375
... who don't have anyone
to support and close the case.

1169
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:13,708
Your friend is blinking.

1170
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,333
If we're suspicious,
everything will be dubious only.

1171
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:22,792
By your unnecessary talks
don't create suspicion.

1172
01:04:22,792 --> 01:04:25,292
This is an unnecessary curiosity, Saravanan.

1173
01:04:27,167 --> 01:04:29,667
Didn't I tell you,
that you've more curiosity.

1174
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:35,833
Curiosity kills the cat.

1175
01:04:41,833 --> 01:04:43,208
Hey, what did he say?

1176
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:45,542
First, make your eyes normal.

1177
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:49,208
Hey, what did he say?

1178
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:50,083
Wait.

1179
01:04:51,542 --> 01:04:53,667
Hello, Saravanan.
-tell me, sister.

1180
01:04:53,667 --> 01:04:55,917
Are you good?
-yes, tell me.

1181
01:04:56,250 --> 01:05:00,375
Upon checking the horoscope,
I was told a female child will be born.

1182
01:05:00,375 --> 01:05:03,458
My husband's health
has to be taken care of.

1183
01:05:04,667 --> 01:05:06,458
Kavitha's blindness...

1184
01:05:06,458 --> 01:05:07,792
Had food?

1185
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:09,042
I was told a female child will be born.

1186
01:05:09,042 --> 01:05:12,083
I'm blabbering only to my brother.

1187
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:14,000
Uncle's health...

1188
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,667
All these weakness has turned to be strengths.

1189
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:18,583
I was advised to go to temple
on every Saturday.

1190
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,667
That god would've seen us
when struggling for food.

1191
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,208
Let him see.

1192
01:05:23,208 --> 01:05:25,125
Hello, Saravanan.
-okay, sister.

1193
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,500
More customers in the shop now..

1194
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:27,625
I'll call you later.

1195
01:05:27,625 --> 01:05:28,583
Okay.

1196
01:05:28,917 --> 01:05:30,292
Was it from home?

1197
01:05:30,292 --> 01:05:30,583
Yes.

1198
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:31,417
What's the information?

1199
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:32,042
Simply.

1200
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:33,500
What did the egg head say?

1201
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,833
You won't understand now.

1202
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,167
Get lost.

1203
01:05:37,167 --> 01:05:38,042
Always, saying I don't understand.

1204
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:13,958
Who's that in the morning?

1205
01:06:16,583 --> 01:06:17,625
Where are you from?

1206
01:06:17,625 --> 01:06:18,583
Where are you working?

1207
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,708
Where were you
when the jewelry went missing?

1208
01:06:19,708 --> 01:06:20,875
Sir...
-I'm asking you. Isn't it?

1209
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:22,333
Sir, wait.
-Hey, who are you?

1210
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,125
Where are you working?
-I'll tell.

1211
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,083
Hey, you tell me.

1212
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:26,042
Sir.
-I'm asking you?

1213
01:06:26,042 --> 01:06:27,125
You...
-hey.

1214
01:06:28,542 --> 01:06:30,417
Kathir, leave him.

1215
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:31,250
Hey, leave him.

1216
01:06:31,250 --> 01:06:32,667
Sister, be quiet.

1217
01:06:32,667 --> 01:06:35,417
If we inquire them in the right way,
the truth will be revealed.

1218
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:37,167
First, you leave from here.

1219
01:06:37,167 --> 01:06:38,083
Why?

1220
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,292
Don't mistake him.

1221
01:06:40,292 --> 01:06:41,375
He is harsh.

1222
01:06:41,375 --> 01:06:41,958
Who are you?
-it's okay, sister.

1223
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:42,792
-Who are you?
-oh no, Kathir.

1224
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:44,167
-Where are you working?
-why?

1225
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,417
-I'm asking, where do you work?
-Kathir, leave him.

1226
01:06:45,417 --> 01:06:46,750
-Why, will you get me a job?
-shit.

1227
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:49,167
He made me to sweat
in few minutes.

1228
01:06:49,167 --> 01:06:50,500
He is very enraged.

1229
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,708
Don't worry, Mani.
An enraged person can't do anything.

1230
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:02,042
Why the owner asked
not to open the shop today?

1231
01:07:02,042 --> 01:07:03,625
Is he suspicious on us?

1232
01:07:03,625 --> 01:07:05,083
Why are you afraid?

1233
01:07:05,083 --> 01:07:06,417
How many times to say?

1234
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:07,542
He told to close the shop
for just one day.

1235
01:07:07,542 --> 01:07:08,833
Can we ask him the reason?

1236
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:10,000
His shop.

1237
01:07:10,458 --> 01:07:11,750
You panic at everyone...

1238
01:07:12,208 --> 01:07:12,542
Hey...

1239
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:17,042
What are we talking about?

1240
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:19,250
How are you, brother?

1241
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:20,167
I'm good.

1242
01:07:21,792 --> 01:07:22,625
Saravanan...

1243
01:07:26,458 --> 01:07:26,792
Tell me.

1244
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:29,625
The bridegroom cancelled
the marriage arranged in home.

1245
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:32,292
He said he'll get married
to the girl whom he was in love.

1246
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:35,917
I understood the meaning
of love, then.

1247
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:36,875
25G.

1248
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:39,250
That's not the bus,
I've to travel.

1249
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,333
But, we have to go
by that bus.

1250
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:41,958
You stay back and go
by the bus you've to.

1251
01:07:41,958 --> 01:07:42,500
Come on.

1252
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:06,333
She says that she understood
what's meant by love.

1253
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:09,625
Unexpectedly she met me
at the bus stop and spoke.

1254
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:11,375
Has she come in search of me?

1255
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:15,542
I don't know what
she understood about love.

1256
01:08:16,083 --> 01:08:19,250
But, I understood well on the day
she left me.

1257
01:08:19,542 --> 01:08:21,125
Next time, if she would've got married,

1258
01:08:21,125 --> 01:08:24,042
I might meet her with husband,
even with her child...

1259
01:08:24,042 --> 01:08:26,250
She won't even speak, then.

1260
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:30,458
Mani, women's life will move on
for next stage.

1261
01:08:30,458 --> 01:08:32,542
Though, they're willing or not.

1262
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:38,625
Not only that, because of another girl,
sins piled up on us.

1263
01:08:38,792 --> 01:08:39,375
What?

1264
01:08:40,667 --> 01:08:41,500
Nothing.

1265
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,042
What did you say now?

1266
01:08:43,042 --> 01:08:44,042
Take the ticket.

1267
01:08:45,667 --> 01:08:46,792
Two tickets for Mount road.

1268
01:08:51,958 --> 01:08:52,875
Hello!

1269
01:08:53,292 --> 01:08:54,792
Dad, I'm Mani speaking.

1270
01:08:55,292 --> 01:08:56,542
This is my new contact number.

1271
01:08:56,542 --> 01:08:58,292
Call this number, hereafter.

1272
01:08:58,833 --> 01:08:59,708
Okay?

1273
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:12,292
Hey, Ibrahim!

1274
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:13,708
Saravanan!

1275
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:16,750
Are you fine?

1276
01:09:16,750 --> 01:09:17,708
I'm fine, Saravanan.

1277
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,042
How are you?

1278
01:09:19,833 --> 01:09:21,625
I heard that your father has expired.

1279
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,542
So many things has happened.

1280
01:09:26,542 --> 01:09:28,125
Do you believe me, Saravanan?

1281
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,167
Definitely, I believe you.

1282
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:30,958
Thank you.

1283
01:09:32,208 --> 01:09:33,792
How is the owner?

1284
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:37,208
I met her few days before.

1285
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,625
When coming back
from my prayers.

1286
01:09:41,167 --> 01:09:42,292
Sister, how are you?

1287
01:09:42,917 --> 01:09:43,833
Fine.

1288
01:09:43,833 --> 01:09:47,292
I expected that you'll tell the police
that I'm not to be mistaken.

1289
01:09:47,292 --> 01:09:48,958
That is...

1290
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:49,958
It's okay, sister.

1291
01:09:50,292 --> 01:09:51,250
I understood.

1292
01:09:51,792 --> 01:09:53,500
What's your stance on that day!

1293
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:57,000
But, the tenants in our house
is like our family.

1294
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,042
Don't leave them.

1295
01:10:00,417 --> 01:10:01,667
Never suspect them.

1296
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:03,958
I'm leaving.

1297
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,542
What I said is right,
isn't it, Saravanan?

1298
01:10:11,417 --> 01:10:12,208
Hey, move.

1299
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,875
Mani, are you fine?

1300
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:16,833
I came along with my friend.

1301
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:17,583
We'll meet later.

1302
01:10:17,583 --> 01:10:18,125
Yes.

1303
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:19,042
Bye.
-Okay.

1304
01:10:21,667 --> 01:10:23,042
Why did you meet him?

1305
01:10:23,042 --> 01:10:24,375
I spoke to him voluntarily.

1306
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:26,000
Why are you doing that?

1307
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:30,625
I understood, you spoke to him
for not being suspicious.

1308
01:10:30,625 --> 01:10:31,292
Superb!

1309
01:10:32,375 --> 01:10:33,250
What?

1310
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:35,542
Come on, let's go.

1311
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:36,708
Have you taken the book,
you said about?

1312
01:10:36,708 --> 01:10:38,583
No, I've to search, hereafter.

1313
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:43,958
I thought you'd have been to work.

1314
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:45,500
Else, I would've called you earlier.

1315
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,500
Yeah, why the shop
is closed today?

1316
01:10:49,917 --> 01:10:52,833
I'm not inquiring,
just asking.

1317
01:10:53,083 --> 01:10:54,875
Whatever you speak, is like inquiry.

1318
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,792
That's why,
I asked you both to sit.

1319
01:10:57,083 --> 01:10:57,625
It's okay.

1320
01:10:57,750 --> 01:11:01,208
Sometimes, our boss will call us
and ask not to open the shop.

1321
01:11:01,208 --> 01:11:02,750
We don't ask him for the reason.

1322
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:05,167
Don't mistake me,
I shouted on that day in anger.

1323
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:06,750
You would've felt anger,

1324
01:11:06,750 --> 01:11:08,208
If the theft has occurred
in your home too.

1325
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:09,833
Lakshmi!

1326
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:11,917
I'm coming.

1327
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:15,083
It's not a big family.

1328
01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:17,833
It was decided long ago
that marriage is not my life.

1329
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,417
So, the whole of my life
is my sister's family.

1330
01:11:21,417 --> 01:11:22,042
Thats all...

1331
01:11:24,167 --> 01:11:27,208
My sister told me earlier,
that you both guys are good.

1332
01:11:27,208 --> 01:11:29,042
The guy who was arrested
on suspicion, what's his name?

1333
01:11:29,042 --> 01:11:29,583
Ibrahim.

1334
01:11:30,083 --> 01:11:31,958
She says that he is
also a good guy.

1335
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:33,750
But, I won't believe.

1336
01:11:34,125 --> 01:11:35,042
Including the god.

1337
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:36,375
So many deities here...

1338
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:38,458
Has the god stopped the thief?

1339
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:40,250
Will the god be the witness?

1340
01:11:40,708 --> 01:11:41,958
I don't have faith on the police.

1341
01:11:41,958 --> 01:11:43,417
It's one among the few cases.

1342
01:11:43,917 --> 01:11:45,542
I don't know whether
they'll inquire properly.

1343
01:11:45,542 --> 01:11:46,167
Yes.

1344
01:11:46,667 --> 01:11:47,792
Does the cemetery caretaker know
the pain of the people...

1345
01:11:47,792 --> 01:11:48,917
...weeping in the graveyard?

1346
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:53,583
Okay, brother.

1347
01:11:53,583 --> 01:11:54,292
We're leaving.

1348
01:11:55,042 --> 01:11:55,583
Bye, sister.

1349
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:56,417
Okay.

1350
01:11:58,625 --> 01:11:59,958
He called us that he wants
to talk but inquired...

1351
01:12:01,083 --> 01:12:02,042
What, brother?

1352
01:12:02,333 --> 01:12:04,833
Nothing, you go.

1353
01:12:08,833 --> 01:12:10,625
He called us to talk
and inquired.

1354
01:12:10,625 --> 01:12:12,000
He speaks aesthetically like you.

1355
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,708
We must be careful.

1356
01:12:12,708 --> 01:12:13,292
Else, we'd get caught.

1357
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:26,292
Hey...

1358
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:28,458
Sir asked to bring you.

1359
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:28,958
Come on.

1360
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:29,500
Why, sir?

1361
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:58,333
Sir, a small hint regarding
the jewelry theft of our owner's house.

1362
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:01,792
A month ago, a guy was starring
at the house.

1363
01:13:02,792 --> 01:13:06,083
Sir,when I asked him, he simply nod
his head as nothing and left.

1364
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:08,083
Today, I saw him at the signal.

1365
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,458
I can identify him, sir.

1366
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:14,167
I need to give a complaint
regarding that, sir.

1367
01:13:15,875 --> 01:13:16,500
Sir...

1368
01:13:24,958 --> 01:13:26,583
Sir...The guy who comes to steal
from outside,

1369
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:29,083
Will he steal when known
there is a person inside?

1370
01:13:30,125 --> 01:13:32,167
He can't get up.

1371
01:13:32,167 --> 01:13:33,625
He doesn't know,
even if see.

1372
01:13:33,625 --> 01:13:35,625
So, the one who knows
about that house...

1373
01:13:35,625 --> 01:13:37,667
...and the people
has done the theft.

1374
01:13:37,917 --> 01:13:39,458
Sir, the tea master.

1375
01:13:40,042 --> 01:13:40,875
Let him sit along with them.

1376
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:41,833
Hey, go inside and sit.

1377
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:43,333
Go.

1378
01:13:44,792 --> 01:13:47,625
The past tenants of that house,

1379
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:49,667
Those who reside at present,

1380
01:13:49,667 --> 01:13:51,167
Including who delivers watercans...

1381
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,167
The search is going on
in everyone's house.

1382
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,875
Even in your native
and in relative's houses...

1383
01:13:54,875 --> 01:13:57,042
...the search is going on.

1384
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:58,917
Sir...

1385
01:14:02,917 --> 01:14:04,042
(Indistinct voices)

1386
01:14:04,042 --> 01:14:04,708
Leave us inside.

1387
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:05,958
Your son has done a mistake.

1388
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,375
My son wouldn't have done
any mistake.

1389
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:09,292
I won't let you in.

1390
01:14:09,292 --> 01:14:11,458
Each and every house
is like a temple for us.

1391
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:12,500
Sir, please understand.

1392
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,750
Let us go inside.

1393
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,250
Go away...

1394
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:14,875
Don't come here.

1395
01:14:14,875 --> 01:14:15,500
Go away...

1396
01:14:15,875 --> 01:14:16,583
We can't, sir.

1397
01:14:16,583 --> 01:14:17,083
Go out.

1398
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:19,250
Greetings, sir.
-what happened?

1399
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:22,375
Their clan is huge, in Kayalpattinam.
-so what?

1400
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:24,792
If anything turns as a problem...

1401
01:14:25,542 --> 01:14:27,625
We don't have search warrant, sir.

1402
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:30,292
If the people take the caste
and religion for their own...

1403
01:14:30,292 --> 01:14:33,875
... whenever they need, then what's the
use of existence of the police?

1404
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:35,708
Get inside and search, sir.

1405
01:14:36,042 --> 01:14:36,750
Okay, sir.

1406
01:14:38,042 --> 01:14:38,667
Madam.

1407
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:40,208
Clear out.

1408
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:42,792
Sir,

1409
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,208
What?

1410
01:14:44,208 --> 01:14:45,000
Just a minute, sir.

1411
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:46,958
Tell me.

1412
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,042
I'm from press, sir.

1413
01:14:50,625 --> 01:14:51,542
So what?

1414
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:52,833
Just to get introduced.

1415
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:53,708
Be seated.

1416
01:14:54,125 --> 01:14:54,667
No, sir.

1417
01:14:54,667 --> 01:14:55,500
Sit down.

1418
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:57,750
Be quiet.

1419
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:58,792
Is that the new phone?

1420
01:14:59,333 --> 01:14:59,958
Come here.

1421
01:15:01,458 --> 01:15:02,667
Switch on the speaker.

1422
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:08,667
Hey, raid is going on in our house
as if you're a big shot.

1423
01:15:08,667 --> 01:15:10,583
Are you a minister
to raid in your house?

1424
01:15:11,667 --> 01:15:12,250
Go away.

1425
01:15:12,667 --> 01:15:13,583
That's not raid.

1426
01:15:13,583 --> 01:15:14,333
It's search.

1427
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:21,875
You too switch on the speaker.

1428
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:24,542
Tell me, mom.

1429
01:15:24,542 --> 01:15:27,500
Saravanan, police is searching
for something in the entire house.

1430
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:28,542
What happened?

1431
01:15:28,833 --> 01:15:29,833
Don't be panic, mom.

1432
01:15:29,833 --> 01:15:31,833
Didn't I tell you the jewelry
was stolen in the owner's house?

1433
01:15:31,833 --> 01:15:34,083
That's why, they're searching
in the houses of the tenants.

1434
01:15:36,875 --> 01:15:38,375
Your sister is very much afraid.

1435
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:40,042
When the police suddenly
entered the house.

1436
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:41,667
Don't be afraid, mom.

1437
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:42,833
Dad is with us.

1438
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:45,708
Okay.

1439
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:51,167
Sir, why are you interrogating them?

1440
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:53,750
Did I ask you to interrogate them?

1441
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:57,000
When the chennai city was flooded,
everyone stayed in my house only.

1442
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,417
Will they steal, sir?

1443
01:15:58,417 --> 01:16:00,458
Don't shout, simply.

1444
01:16:00,458 --> 01:16:02,625
Your brother has put pressure to investigate.

1445
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:03,542
If we investigate,

1446
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:05,833
You shout why do we investigate?

1447
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:07,292
Don't I've any other work?

1448
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:10,375
I'll imprison you and your brother
stating as you hid the jewelry...

1449
01:16:10,375 --> 01:16:11,458
...and both enacting a drama.

1450
01:16:11,458 --> 01:16:12,167
Sir...

1451
01:16:12,833 --> 01:16:13,542
What?

1452
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,583
If something gets caught
in anyone's house,

1453
01:16:18,583 --> 01:16:20,042
I'll peel off your skin.

1454
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:22,667
Hey, send them out.

1455
01:16:24,750 --> 01:16:26,292
Go there.Sir, the identity about the person...

1456
01:16:26,292 --> 01:16:27,125
Go there.

1457
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:30,167
Hey, come here.

1458
01:16:30,417 --> 01:16:31,333
Raid?

1459
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:32,792
Go.

1460
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:34,333
Sir...

1461
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:35,667
Bye, sir.

1462
01:16:37,083 --> 01:16:37,792
Come, on.

1463
01:16:38,167 --> 01:16:40,917
I told you earlier,
not to talk with him.

1464
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:42,958
You went to file a complaint...

1465
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,667
...but he threatens you
to get surrendered.

1466
01:16:46,833 --> 01:16:47,542
Yes, sir.

1467
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:48,667
What to do now?

1468
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:50,542
If he force, tell me.

1469
01:16:51,042 --> 01:16:52,375
I'll do my best.

1470
01:16:52,625 --> 01:16:53,125
Okay, sir.

1471
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,250
Brother, two cups of tea.

1472
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,583
One with added sugar.

1473
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:58,875
What these guys are doing here?

1474
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:03,167
Hey, are you having the tea here,
as your shop tea is not good.

1475
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:05,583
What to do now?

1476
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,083
Why should we get punished
which is not our mistake?

1477
01:17:07,083 --> 01:17:08,250
What's it about?

1478
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:08,625
Nothing.

1479
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:09,500
Nothing, Sathish.

1480
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,583
Be quiet.
-you stay quiet.

1481
01:17:10,583 --> 01:17:13,417
The police is trying to implicate us
in the fault which we haven't done.

1482
01:17:13,417 --> 01:17:14,083
What are you saying?

1483
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:14,958
Tell me in detail.

1484
01:17:16,625 --> 01:17:17,500
Take the tea.

1485
01:17:20,917 --> 01:17:21,917
Don't turn suddenly.

1486
01:17:21,917 --> 01:17:23,375
Let him switch on
the pen camera.

1487
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,875
You dare to hit me.

1488
01:17:24,875 --> 01:17:27,083
I'll show the power
of the media.

1489
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:28,708
Tell me.

1490
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:34,458
The Inspector of C2 Police station is trying
to implicate us in the jewelry theft case.

1491
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:38,125
The guys of Vadapalani, Chennai
was compelled...

1492
01:17:38,125 --> 01:17:40,083
... to turn as approvers
in a theft case.

1493
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:43,750
Whereas, an enquiry commission
has been instituted on Inspector Eshwar.

1494
01:17:43,917 --> 01:17:46,458
When contacted the Inspector,
regarding this...

1495
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:47,333
How is it?

1496
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:48,375
You're rocking!
-superb, Satish.

1497
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:49,958
When did you took this
without our knowledge?

1498
01:17:49,958 --> 01:17:51,292
That's the brain of the media.

1499
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:52,833
The reach of this information
wouldn't be vast...

1500
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:54,083
...if telecasted in our channel.

1501
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:57,542
Now, the news has got
an importance...

1502
01:17:57,542 --> 01:18:01,375
...and I too have a chance
for a better job in that channel.

1503
01:18:01,375 --> 01:18:04,167
This is what,
two birds worth in the bush.

1504
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:05,333
We must learn.

1505
01:18:05,833 --> 01:18:06,500
It's okay, Sathish.

1506
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,000
Won't it be a problem for us?

1507
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:08,875
Will it be a problem?

1508
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:10,208
Will I leave?

1509
01:18:10,208 --> 01:18:12,625
The media power is unbeatable.

1510
01:18:12,875 --> 01:18:13,667
Yes...

1511
01:18:13,667 --> 01:18:15,708
If anyone hits us,

1512
01:18:15,708 --> 01:18:18,833
Four people will debate on TV
about us and will save, isn't it?

1513
01:18:19,083 --> 01:18:19,917
Am I right, Sathish?

1514
01:18:19,917 --> 01:18:20,875
Yes, that's it.

1515
01:18:20,875 --> 01:18:22,083
Saravanan, then...

1516
01:18:22,083 --> 01:18:24,875
My channel will take an interview
of you both.

1517
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:26,708
An episode on crime is going on.

1518
01:18:26,708 --> 01:18:29,958
For half an hour,
only you'll be the highlight.

1519
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:31,958
We'll increase the TRP rating
by modifying the events.

1520
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,708
Satish, it's superb!

1521
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:38,167
In interview, don't say that
he asked you to turn as approvar.

1522
01:18:38,167 --> 01:18:39,750
Add some extra points.

1523
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,083
Definitely.

1524
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:44,042
They won't let me talk
for five minutes

1525
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,542
Is it he?

1526
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,792
Meditation?

1527
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:50,042
Again?

1528
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:52,167
I'll come.

1529
01:18:53,333 --> 01:18:56,000
A flash news from Marina.

1530
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,042
I'll go for the coverage.

1531
01:18:57,292 --> 01:18:57,792
Watch the TV continuously.

1532
01:18:58,417 --> 01:18:59,833
Okay.

1533
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:01,125
Don't go for the job.

1534
01:19:01,125 --> 01:19:01,750
Spoilt...

1535
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:02,333
I ll take leave.

1536
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,500
Hey, why did you say like that
to the egghead?

1537
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:12,208
He is our trumpet card.

1538
01:19:12,208 --> 01:19:13,833
Shouldn't the news spread
to the department?

1539
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:14,667
That's it...

1540
01:19:19,958 --> 01:19:20,875
Superb!

1541
01:19:21,417 --> 01:19:22,458
I'm so happy.

1542
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:24,083
Everything is over, isn't it?

1543
01:19:24,083 --> 01:19:25,625
Some things are yet
to get over, Mani.

1544
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:27,625
What's that still?

1545
01:19:27,625 --> 01:19:29,167
Two things happen similarly.

1546
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:30,042
Similarly, means?

1547
01:19:30,042 --> 01:19:30,750
Is it double action?

1548
01:19:30,750 --> 01:19:32,292
How to tell you?

1549
01:19:33,042 --> 01:19:34,917
Shall we call Kathir brother
for booze?

1550
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:35,750
No...

1551
01:19:36,083 --> 01:19:37,875
He speaks as if inquiring.

1552
01:19:37,875 --> 01:19:39,458
You want to take booze
with him?

1553
01:19:39,458 --> 01:19:40,708
I may blabber.

1554
01:19:45,417 --> 01:19:45,792
Brother.

1555
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:46,667
What are you doing?

1556
01:19:49,042 --> 01:19:50,750
Is there any A.C bar nearby?

1557
01:19:53,917 --> 01:19:54,792
Will you take alcohol?

1558
01:19:54,792 --> 01:19:55,417
Who's that?

1559
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:56,667
Kathir brother...

1560
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,458
Why're you talking about him?

1561
01:19:58,458 --> 01:19:58,958
What?

1562
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:02,458
Nothing, we want to ask whether
you can help us to join a good job?

1563
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:03,375
Yes, brother.

1564
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:06,542
Okay, let's see.

1565
01:20:07,458 --> 01:20:08,958
Will both of you take alcohol?

1566
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:11,083
Why are you blinking?

1567
01:20:11,250 --> 01:20:12,125
Will you drinK?

1568
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,167
Come on.

1569
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:17,000
Hey, you too come.

1570
01:20:21,625 --> 01:20:22,833
Did he overhead you?

1571
01:20:24,583 --> 01:20:25,875
He says the same
what you said.

1572
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:26,917
Don't know.

1573
01:20:40,417 --> 01:20:42,833
He has become flat so soon?

1574
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:44,292
He ever does the same.

1575
01:20:44,292 --> 01:20:47,792
He'll become flat in the AC bar.
Got used to local bars only.

1576
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,167
He resembles my friend.

1577
01:20:50,333 --> 01:20:53,125
But, he is not alive now.

1578
01:20:53,125 --> 01:20:53,750
Why?

1579
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:54,958
What happened?

1580
01:20:55,292 --> 01:20:56,833
He died in a railway crossing.

1581
01:20:58,833 --> 01:20:59,792
Leave that.

1582
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:02,792
I asked you about Ibrahim.

1583
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:05,042
We are not close to him.

1584
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:10,792
Don't know, whether he treated us
cheap or we thought like that.

1585
01:21:10,792 --> 01:21:15,000
Not only that, he'll leave before us
to the job.

1586
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:18,292
You went to your native
when the theft occurred, isn't it?

1587
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:22,375
Why are you inquiring
similiar to the police station?

1588
01:21:23,958 --> 01:21:27,375
If he was inquired properly,
why am I going to question you?

1589
01:21:27,375 --> 01:21:28,333
Tell me the truth.

1590
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,583
Did he ask you to be approver?

1591
01:21:29,583 --> 01:21:30,250
Brother...

1592
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:31,583
Will I lie in this?

1593
01:21:31,792 --> 01:21:33,750
It's all because of Satish.

1594
01:21:33,750 --> 01:21:34,625
You too...

1595
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:37,542
Hey, one repeat.

1596
01:21:39,958 --> 01:21:41,833
Why am I asking is,

1597
01:21:42,417 --> 01:21:44,958
The one who is clear that a person is
not well in home

1598
01:21:44,958 --> 01:21:47,083
The one who is familiar with
the house plan

1599
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:50,375
I told him to enquire the persons
who know all these.

1600
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:52,542
When he is not interested in this case,

1601
01:21:52,542 --> 01:21:54,792
How he would've trapped
you both in this case?

1602
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,917
Don't know what's his anger on us?

1603
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:00,583
Leave that.

1604
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,667
Do you know,
how would I've investigated this case?

1605
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,625
Only with finger prints.

1606
01:22:06,583 --> 01:22:07,667
Why?

1607
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:15,833
If the thief has used handkerchief,

1608
01:22:15,833 --> 01:22:18,417
if even my sister's
finger prints and all others...

1609
01:22:18,417 --> 01:22:20,792
...who searched in bureau
are there?

1610
01:22:20,792 --> 01:22:24,833
Yes...I didn't think of it.

1611
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:29,958
You must have an intelligence
to question foolishly.

1612
01:22:29,958 --> 01:22:30,917
I can't understand.

1613
01:22:31,542 --> 01:22:32,292
You would've understood.

1614
01:22:35,208 --> 01:22:36,208
Will you smoke?

1615
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:43,083
Where are you from?

1616
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:44,917
Pokkampatti near to Madurai.

1617
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,750
That's not near to Madurai.

1618
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,250
It's the Pokkampatti near
to Tirumangalam.

1619
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:50,875
I am familiar about all the places
in Tamilnadu.

1620
01:22:51,833 --> 01:22:52,792
Do you know, Naduvakottai?

1621
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:54,417
Yeah, I know.
It's near to my place.

1622
01:22:54,667 --> 01:22:55,875
That's the native of Kumar.

1623
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:58,958
Didn't I say, my friend
Kumar will behave...

1624
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,417
...like your friend Mani.

1625
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:05,333
His father is a street play artist.

1626
01:23:06,125 --> 01:23:07,458
Everyone knows
when addressed as...

1627
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,000
...Kumar son of Raman,
a street play artist.

1628
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,667
We both struggled in life.

1629
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:13,667
He left this world happily
in short span of life.

1630
01:23:15,417 --> 01:23:17,333
I like you both very much.

1631
01:23:19,292 --> 01:23:21,833
Meanwhile, I'm dubious on you both.

1632
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:23,125
What's this still?

1633
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:25,333
You can't understand that if I say.

1634
01:23:26,125 --> 01:23:28,292
You're not in that age too.
Come on.

1635
01:23:28,958 --> 01:23:31,208
Tomorrow morning,
I'm going to Trichy for a work.

1636
01:23:31,625 --> 01:23:33,208
Both of you asked about your job.

1637
01:23:33,417 --> 01:23:34,333
I remember that.

1638
01:23:43,750 --> 01:23:44,583
What?

1639
01:23:46,542 --> 01:23:47,375
Sir, juice.

1640
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:54,750
Why are you looking dull?

1641
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,125
Kathir was the only problem for us.

1642
01:23:56,125 --> 01:23:57,500
He too left to his native place.

1643
01:23:57,500 --> 01:23:58,750
I'm going to my home tonight.

1644
01:23:58,750 --> 01:24:00,417
My father's rememberable day.

1645
01:24:00,917 --> 01:24:02,417
Has thirty days passed?

1646
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:06,250
Then, I got a trustful person regarding
the exchange of the jewelry.

1647
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,667
I'll meet him also.

1648
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:10,375
But, you said not to hurry.

1649
01:24:10,792 --> 01:24:12,667
No, a trustful person is there.

1650
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,000
It'll be right.

1651
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:15,583
I'll meet him.

1652
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:16,583
You proceed.

1653
01:24:16,583 --> 01:24:17,167
I'll take care.

1654
01:24:18,167 --> 01:24:20,000
The boss will scold as
I take leave frequently.

1655
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,625
Not to worry
even if he expels us from job.

1656
01:24:21,625 --> 01:24:23,208
We'll start a new shop
What do you say?

1657
01:24:30,458 --> 01:24:34,458
"The journey which continues
in search of the solutions"

1658
01:24:35,167 --> 01:24:38,333
"Will it show you the way
ahead of the pains?"

1659
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:40,333
...Kumar son of Raman,
a street play artist.

1660
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:42,208
"The queries which arise within you"

1661
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:45,708
"Will it happen as per the fate?"

1662
01:24:45,708 --> 01:24:53,500
"The mind gets clear whatever
the way you choose to go..."

1663
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:55,708
"Who are you?"

1664
01:24:55,708 --> 01:24:58,500
"Go and search, my dear friend..."

1665
01:24:58,500 --> 01:24:59,208
Brother, just a minute.

1666
01:24:59,458 --> 01:25:01,083
Where is Kumar's house?

1667
01:25:01,708 --> 01:25:02,458
You mean, Kumar?

1668
01:25:02,708 --> 01:25:05,583
Street play artist Raman's son Kumar's house...

1669
01:25:05,708 --> 01:25:06,417
Is he?

1670
01:25:06,417 --> 01:25:07,167
The neighbouring house.

1671
01:25:07,417 --> 01:25:09,083
That house?
-Yeah, that one.

1672
01:25:09,083 --> 01:25:11,750
Don't know whether anyone is there.
-They're there. just now seen them.

1673
01:25:11,750 --> 01:25:12,667
Okay, brother.

1674
01:25:15,333 --> 01:25:15,708
Sir.

1675
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,167
Whom do you want?
-Kumar...

1676
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:22,000
Just wait a minute
I will call mom.

1677
01:25:22,625 --> 01:25:23,167
Mom.

1678
01:25:25,042 --> 01:25:25,583
Tell me.

1679
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:26,708
Kumar?

1680
01:25:26,708 --> 01:25:27,792
I am his wife.

1681
01:25:27,792 --> 01:25:28,625
He is no more.

1682
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:30,625
Oh, is it!

1683
01:25:31,667 --> 01:25:33,167
Did Kathir and Kumar worked together?

1684
01:25:33,167 --> 01:25:35,167
Yeah, the both worked together in Theni.

1685
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:36,667
Who is that?

1686
01:25:36,958 --> 01:25:37,708
Don't know, aunt.

1687
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:39,083
Whom do you want?
-Greetings, mam.

1688
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,333
I'm coming from Theni.

1689
01:25:40,667 --> 01:25:43,542
In the work place of Kumar,
the old workers were felicitated...

1690
01:25:43,542 --> 01:25:45,500
Enough of your felicitation.

1691
01:25:45,583 --> 01:25:48,458
Did your owner come when my son
was arrested by the police?

1692
01:25:49,625 --> 01:25:50,583
Who are you asking about?

1693
01:25:50,583 --> 01:25:52,958
I'm saying about Velmurugan,
the woodshed owner.

1694
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,917
Aren't you coming from there?

1695
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:57,333
Yes.

1696
01:25:57,625 --> 01:25:58,500
Then what?

1697
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:00,667
To find out the real culprits,

1698
01:26:00,667 --> 01:26:03,000
my son and Kathiresan
suffered a lot.

1699
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:07,958
Aunt, leave it.

1700
01:26:07,958 --> 01:26:09,500
No one came to our house
from the locale.

1701
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,125
Don't cry aunt.
-that Kathiresan...

1702
01:26:11,125 --> 01:26:12,667
"Come on...come on..."

1703
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:16,250
"The life like a king is not a puzzle..."

1704
01:26:16,250 --> 01:26:18,375
"The success is not far away..."

1705
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:19,958
"Come on...come on..."

1706
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:23,542
"The life like a king is not a puzzle..."

1707
01:26:23,542 --> 01:26:25,667
"The success is not far away..."

1708
01:26:25,667 --> 01:26:27,167
"Come on...come on..."

1709
01:26:29,292 --> 01:26:31,333
Has anyone worked
as Kathir and Kumar...

1710
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:33,208
...in this wood shed,
some twenty five years ago?

1711
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:59,333
"Everyday, for your sake,
the truth lives hiding itself..."

1712
01:26:59,333 --> 01:27:03,083
"Till then, your search will extend...
Come on..."

1713
01:27:03,667 --> 01:27:05,667
Where is the Zamin house
you mentioned about?

1714
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:08,375
That zamindar's house is in that street.
-There?

1715
01:27:08,375 --> 01:27:09,125
Yes.

1716
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:11,833
Let this bag be here for sometime.

1717
01:27:11,833 --> 01:27:12,542
okay.

1718
01:27:12,958 --> 01:27:17,125
"The sleep fade away from the eyes"

1719
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:17,792
Who are you?

1720
01:27:18,417 --> 01:27:19,125
What's the matter?

1721
01:27:19,333 --> 01:27:20,250
Nothing sir,

1722
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:22,208
To know about any changes
in the investigation...

1723
01:27:22,208 --> 01:27:24,333
...in theft case which happened
twenty five years ago...

1724
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:26,458
...and in the theft case happened now,

1725
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:27,583
I've come to write an article about that.

1726
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:29,125
What's that investigation?

1727
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:31,125
They arrested the servant in the home.

1728
01:27:31,125 --> 01:27:35,542
"The journey which continues
in search of the solutions"

1729
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:39,000
"Will it show you the way
ahead of the pains?"

1730
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,792
"The queries which arise within you"

1731
01:27:42,792 --> 01:27:45,167
"Will it happen as per the fate?"

1732
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:46,417
We didn't get back anything stolen.

1733
01:27:46,417 --> 01:27:47,792
We didn't get back anything stolen.

1734
01:27:47,792 --> 01:27:49,875
Wonder, what's that you investigate?

1735
01:27:49,875 --> 01:27:51,417
Shall I get some water,
please?

1736
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:53,042
Give him water.

1737
01:27:53,042 --> 01:27:55,208
"Who are you?"

1738
01:27:55,208 --> 01:27:58,625
"Go and search, my dear friend..."

1739
01:28:14,583 --> 01:28:15,583
Mom!

1740
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,542
"Come on...come on..."

1741
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:25,125
"The life like a king is not a puzzle..."

1742
01:28:25,125 --> 01:28:27,292
"The success is not far away..."

1743
01:28:27,292 --> 01:28:28,792
"Come on...come on..."

1744
01:28:30,750 --> 01:28:32,333
"Come on...come on..."

1745
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:34,458
"The success is not far away..."

1746
01:28:36,708 --> 01:28:39,417
Uncle! Get up...

1747
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:45,125
Uncle! Get up...

1748
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:48,750
Saravanan, I can't breathe.

1749
01:28:48,917 --> 01:28:49,875
Get up...

1750
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:07,042
I'll leave mom.

1751
01:29:07,042 --> 01:29:08,042
Okay.

1752
01:29:08,833 --> 01:29:09,625
Take care.

1753
01:29:09,625 --> 01:29:11,458
Come often, Saravanan.

1754
01:29:11,458 --> 01:29:12,125
Take care sister.

1755
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:13,917
I'll leave.
- Okay

1756
01:29:26,458 --> 01:29:28,917
Everything went well?

1757
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:35,208
Hey, have you exchanged the jewelry?

1758
01:29:38,125 --> 01:29:39,542
What happened?

1759
01:29:39,542 --> 01:29:40,625
I keep asking you.

1760
01:29:57,917 --> 01:29:58,667
Okay, leave it.

1761
01:29:58,667 --> 01:29:59,875
It's clear in your face.

1762
01:30:00,083 --> 01:30:01,417
You asked me to be patient,
but you hurried?

1763
01:30:01,792 --> 01:30:03,583
You could've done this patiently
with the right person.

1764
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:08,708
Why are you switching it off?

1765
01:30:08,875 --> 01:30:09,792
It's cold.

1766
01:30:10,125 --> 01:30:10,833
Why you need?

1767
01:30:11,458 --> 01:30:12,167
You mean, cold!

1768
01:30:12,542 --> 01:30:13,500
Okay, what happened?

1769
01:30:13,833 --> 01:30:14,542
Whom did you meet?

1770
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:15,833
Is the jewelry safe?

1771
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:16,000
I keep asking, but you...

1772
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,417
I keep asking, but you...

1773
01:30:17,792 --> 01:30:19,375
What happened?

1774
01:30:22,625 --> 01:30:24,000
Mani, there is a theory called
as "Coincidental".

1775
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,708
What I'm asking and
what you're saying?

1776
01:30:25,708 --> 01:30:27,083
I'm replying your question.

1777
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:27,542
Listen.

1778
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:29,125
Okay, tell me.

1779
01:30:29,708 --> 01:30:34,083
Coincidence is the similar
incidents occurred to the...

1780
01:30:34,083 --> 01:30:35,833
...descendants of the
different families.

1781
01:30:35,833 --> 01:30:38,500
We can't say for how many generations
it'll persist.

1782
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:40,000
If it shouldn't continue,

1783
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:41,750
It should end at a focal point.

1784
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:43,708
What?

1785
01:30:43,708 --> 01:30:45,458
I just asked whether you've
exchanged the jewelry?

1786
01:30:45,792 --> 01:30:47,375
Instead, you're blabbering
as descendants,

1787
01:30:47,375 --> 01:30:48,917
focal point and illicit affair.

1788
01:30:48,917 --> 01:30:50,750
Hey, that's a coincidence.

1789
01:30:51,333 --> 01:30:53,250
A kind of law in science.

1790
01:30:53,625 --> 01:30:55,458
Why are you talking about science
to me?

1791
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:57,542
Hey, I'm saying about ourselves.

1792
01:30:58,833 --> 01:31:00,667
Right from the moment,
I thought of stealing the jewelry,

1793
01:31:00,667 --> 01:31:02,625
the incidents happening
at my house…

1794
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:04,500
...related to me is the same as the...

1795
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:07,333
...incidence occuring
at the owner's house.

1796
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:09,958
Thoughts and deeds
are continuing as the same.

1797
01:31:11,292 --> 01:31:13,042
To say you clearly,

1798
01:31:13,042 --> 01:31:16,125
My family's stance is like the Xerox copy
of the owner's family.

1799
01:31:16,292 --> 01:31:17,042
Hello, mom.

1800
01:31:17,333 --> 01:31:17,958
Saravanan...

1801
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:19,750
Your sister went for the tailoring class.

1802
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:22,208
Everyone gossips that
she had eloped with someone.

1803
01:31:22,208 --> 01:31:24,542
I eloped from my house trusting him.

1804
01:31:24,542 --> 01:31:26,958
Your dad got heart pain on hearing that.

1805
01:31:26,958 --> 01:31:29,583
My father died of heart attack
as soon as he knew that.

1806
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:33,875
I wanted to know whether it
happens only because...

1807
01:31:33,875 --> 01:31:36,042
...I decided to steal the jewelry…

1808
01:31:36,042 --> 01:31:38,500
…or is there any other reason?

1809
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:41,083
If I know that, only then
I can stop the next incidents...

1810
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:42,750
...which occur similarly.

1811
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:43,875
I don't understand.

1812
01:31:44,917 --> 01:31:46,583
How to make you understand?

1813
01:31:48,417 --> 01:31:50,708
What happened to my sister
has happened to the owner.

1814
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:53,000
What I did was done by Kathir.

1815
01:31:53,542 --> 01:31:56,750
Still to make you understand,
I'm doing what Kathir has done.

1816
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:01,042
Then, why shouldn't Kathir have stolen
similar to me?

1817
01:32:05,292 --> 01:32:08,417
To know this, Kathir's friend, Kumar...

1818
01:32:08,833 --> 01:32:09,708
Me?

1819
01:32:09,708 --> 01:32:13,125
I went to Naduvakottai, to know about Kumar
who died in the railway crossing.

1820
01:32:14,250 --> 01:32:16,375
Kathir and Kumar worked together.

1821
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:21,250
For a theft case, in chieftain's house,
police arrested both of them.

1822
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:24,083
But the police arrested Murugan
who was working in that house,

1823
01:32:24,083 --> 01:32:26,000
And let both these guys freely.

1824
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,958
Only after, I went to that chieftain's house,
I came to know that,

1825
01:32:37,167 --> 01:32:38,958
I asked my mom what happened?

1826
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:42,917
Your father fought with your grandfather
that Murugan wouldn't have done that.

1827
01:32:42,917 --> 01:32:44,458
But, your grandfather didn't heed.

1828
01:32:44,458 --> 01:32:48,875
I would've pushed you out of the house
when you got married to other caste girl.

1829
01:32:48,875 --> 01:32:51,833
Now, are you talking as a communist
supporting the low caste guy.

1830
01:32:51,833 --> 01:32:53,125
Get out of the house.

1831
01:32:59,417 --> 01:33:01,542
He brought up you without any traces of it.

1832
01:33:02,125 --> 01:33:03,875
When I asked him why?

1833
01:33:04,417 --> 01:33:06,083
We have come with dignity to lead a life.

1834
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:09,167
Instead of knowing me
as a heir of Rangarajan Zamindar

1835
01:33:09,167 --> 01:33:11,208
Who was enslaved by the British,

1836
01:33:11,208 --> 01:33:13,792
I feel proud to know to my posterity as
a poor farmer.

1837
01:33:15,208 --> 01:33:19,792
He was worried in his death bed,
that he can't lift his family.

1838
01:33:21,042 --> 01:33:25,500
That's why he kept saying
that we're from a honoured family.

1839
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,458
One day, you'll find out the
roots of your...

1840
01:33:27,458 --> 01:33:29,375
...lineage by your knowledge.

1841
01:33:29,375 --> 01:33:31,708
He asked me to say
everything, then.

1842
01:33:36,833 --> 01:33:38,833
It was Kathir and Kumar,
who had stolen the jewelry from my house.

1843
01:33:38,833 --> 01:33:41,792
They trapped Murugan into this,
like how we trapped Ibrahim.

1844
01:33:41,792 --> 01:33:42,875
What's the evidence for everything you say?

1845
01:33:42,875 --> 01:33:44,292
What's the evidence for our stealing?

1846
01:33:44,625 --> 01:33:47,417
After twenty years, when I settled down
well in life, if anyone asks...

1847
01:33:47,417 --> 01:33:50,625
...will I say that I did burglary or
I'll say that I worked hard?

1848
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:52,792
You're not involving me
in anything.

1849
01:33:53,333 --> 01:33:55,958
If the incidents continue,
you'll not be alive, Mani.

1850
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:00,250
Hey,

1851
01:34:00,542 --> 01:34:03,667
Then, will I die like Kumar?

1852
01:34:03,667 --> 01:34:07,167
And your niece will be blind like Kavitha
and your brother-in-law will be bed ridden.

1853
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:07,917
Hey, Mani...

1854
01:34:07,917 --> 01:34:08,958
I'll laugh like that only.

1855
01:34:08,958 --> 01:34:10,708
I'll laugh amidst of everyone.

1856
01:34:10,708 --> 01:34:13,833
I'm silent because our theft
might get revealed

1857
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:15,500
Better, you go and consult a doctor.

1858
01:34:16,333 --> 01:34:18,208
You've got a different disease.

1859
01:34:18,208 --> 01:34:21,833
Like something said in films.

1860
01:34:22,417 --> 01:34:26,208
To be right, you are acting foolishly
to show your intelligence.

1861
01:34:26,917 --> 01:34:29,417
When your father was ill,
you planned to steal,

1862
01:34:29,417 --> 01:34:30,708
Is that to challenge the police?

1863
01:34:31,208 --> 01:34:32,958
What you've is not the mind
of the thief.

1864
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:34,958
It's the mind of the police you befriended
with that egg head.

1865
01:34:35,292 --> 01:34:38,792
Whatever you planned to steal
and to escape is to show your intelligence.

1866
01:34:41,125 --> 01:34:42,667
Now also, you went to exchange the gold.

1867
01:34:42,667 --> 01:34:44,583
But, you say as focal point, coincidence...

1868
01:34:45,042 --> 01:34:45,958
Just wait...

1869
01:34:46,083 --> 01:34:47,792
You said, if it shouldn't continue,

1870
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,208
You need a focal point.

1871
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:53,542
That means, you're going to give back
the stolen jewelry to the owner, isn't it?

1872
01:34:53,542 --> 01:34:55,167
Don't speak like a goof.

1873
01:34:55,375 --> 01:34:56,292
Am I a goof?

1874
01:34:56,292 --> 01:34:57,250
You're going to do that only.

1875
01:34:57,250 --> 01:34:59,625
You're going to give the jewels away,
thinking anything won't happen.

1876
01:34:59,625 --> 01:35:00,417
Will I give?

1877
01:35:01,458 --> 01:35:03,083
I just said,
I came to know these things.

1878
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:05,792
If I give the jewels back,
will they leave me?

1879
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:12,958
I was disturbed, as the jewels which
were denied by my father, was in home.

1880
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:13,792
That's why I brought it back?

1881
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:14,583
Did you bring it back?

1882
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:17,417
It's not in there.

1883
01:35:18,750 --> 01:35:21,667
As per our previous plan, I've kept it in a bag
and locked it in cloak room.

1884
01:35:21,667 --> 01:35:25,125
Even when it was in house,
it was safe from the eyes of police.

1885
01:35:25,125 --> 01:35:27,333
You only said, that there's a risk
to keep it in cloak room.

1886
01:35:30,542 --> 01:35:33,042
Now I can see all the ways
in which we'll be caught.

1887
01:35:33,042 --> 01:35:34,542
They won't find on their own.

1888
01:35:34,542 --> 01:35:36,875
This lunatic is going to surrender
it to the police.

1889
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:40,792
I don't trust you.

1890
01:35:41,833 --> 01:35:42,833
Hey you,

1891
01:35:42,833 --> 01:35:44,417
The receipt for the cloak
room is in my purse.

1892
01:35:44,417 --> 01:35:45,708
If you want, you yourself have it.

1893
01:35:45,708 --> 01:35:48,375
I don't have the idea to return it
to the owner.

1894
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:50,000
Don't think like a fool.

1895
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,083
Come and sleep.

1896
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:58,708
Okay, I'll accept whatever you say.

1897
01:35:58,708 --> 01:36:00,875
The jewels you stole
is yours.

1898
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:03,292
The jewels that were stolen from your house
has come back to you.

1899
01:36:03,292 --> 01:36:05,000
Don't confuse yourself by thinking
about this, any longer.

1900
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:07,125
I've told you clearly,
that we'll talk in the morning.

1901
01:36:07,125 --> 01:36:07,750
Shut your trap and sleep.

1902
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,208
For what I'm trying to tell is...

1903
01:36:09,208 --> 01:36:10,750
Switch the lights off
and keep blabbering.

1904
01:36:15,250 --> 01:36:16,750
It's cold.

1905
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:18,833
It's okay.

1906
01:36:20,458 --> 01:36:22,500
What did you ask that day,
while watching the movie at theatre?

1907
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,833
Will you like, if the hero
doesn't use his opportunity?

1908
01:36:26,250 --> 01:36:27,833
Will the hero get confused
like this?

1909
01:36:27,833 --> 01:36:28,917
I'm not confusing.

1910
01:36:28,917 --> 01:36:30,000
I'm speaking clearly.

1911
01:37:36,167 --> 01:37:37,542
Oh, no!

1912
01:37:37,542 --> 01:37:38,458
Kavitha!

1913
01:37:38,458 --> 01:37:40,667
What's this?
Why have you done this?

1914
01:37:40,667 --> 01:37:43,042
Someone please come...

1915
01:37:43,042 --> 01:37:45,000
What happened, sister?
-See, what she has done!

1916
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:45,833
Lift her.

1917
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:55,083
Coincidence means,

1918
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:59,417
The similar incidents will occur
to the descendants of different families.

1919
01:37:59,417 --> 01:38:01,833
That should end at a focal point.

1920
01:38:05,042 --> 01:38:07,583
The moment I thought of
stealing the jewelry,

1921
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:10,458
Whatever happens in my family
related to me...

1922
01:38:10,458 --> 01:38:12,375
...and whatever occurring
at the owner's house.

1923
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:14,625
The thoughts and deeds
are continuing as the same.

1924
01:38:14,625 --> 01:38:17,500
Saravanan, I can't breathe.

1925
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,542
Why shouldn't Kathir
have stolen like me?

1926
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,750
Kathir and Kumar has stolen
in my house.

1927
01:38:22,750 --> 01:38:26,375
How we made Ibrahim as scapegoat,
similarly Murugan was caught there.

1928
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:44,083
Is she better now, sister?

1929
01:38:44,792 --> 01:38:46,583
Yes, they said she is better.

1930
01:38:49,917 --> 01:38:52,750
Sister, I don't want any jewelry.

1931
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:56,542
If you agree,
I'll marry Kavitha.

1932
01:39:09,458 --> 01:39:11,208
Yes, I'm getting a call.

1933
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:11,958
Just a minute.

1934
01:39:13,333 --> 01:39:14,125
Tell me, sister.

1935
01:39:15,125 --> 01:39:16,167
Are you mad?

1936
01:39:16,167 --> 01:39:17,125
Why are you in hurry?

1937
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:18,375
Wait for some time.

1938
01:39:18,375 --> 01:39:20,083
I'll conduct her marriage
finding a good bridegroom .

1939
01:39:20,708 --> 01:39:21,833
That's not, Kathir...

1940
01:39:21,833 --> 01:39:23,167
Who is that?
-won't you listen?

1941
01:39:23,167 --> 01:39:24,208
My brother.

1942
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:26,000
Give me.
-don't do everything as you wish.

1943
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:27,250
Won't I take care?

1944
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:29,875
Without enquiring about him,
you're talking about marriage.

1945
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,667
My father's name is Rathinam.

1946
01:39:31,875 --> 01:39:33,792
My grandfather's name is Rangaraj.

1947
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:36,750
Everyone in Theni knows about
Rangaraj Zamindar.

1948
01:39:39,250 --> 01:39:42,083
Don't you know, who is familiar
about all the places in Tamil Nadu?

1949
01:39:45,958 --> 01:39:47,250
Now, he'll accept, sister.

1950
01:39:47,500 --> 01:39:50,625
If you go home,
inform my husband that Kavitha is well.

1951
01:39:50,625 --> 01:39:51,625
He'll keep blabbering.

1952
01:39:51,625 --> 01:39:52,500
Okay, sister.

1953
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:56,958
Saravanan, how is Kavitha?

1954
01:39:56,958 --> 01:39:57,667
Better now.
-excuse me.

1955
01:39:57,667 --> 01:39:58,833
Is she good?
-Yes, good.

1956
01:39:58,833 --> 01:40:00,375
In which room is she admitted?
-201.

1957
01:40:00,375 --> 01:40:01,833
Come, let's go.
-Go.

1958
01:40:11,167 --> 01:40:12,458
Hey, you...

1959
01:40:13,875 --> 01:40:15,042
Where did you go, goof?

1960
01:40:15,167 --> 01:40:16,333
Where did you go?

1961
01:40:16,333 --> 01:40:17,292
Hey, Mani...

1962
01:40:17,375 --> 01:40:18,917
First you tell me,
where did you go?

1963
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:20,917
Kavitha slit her hand.

1964
01:40:20,917 --> 01:40:21,708
Okay.

1965
01:40:21,708 --> 01:40:23,458
Admitted her in the hospital.

1966
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:24,833
Okay.

1967
01:40:29,208 --> 01:40:32,542
If everything must go well,
I thought, it's right to get married to her.

1968
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:35,917
That's why, I told the owner
voluntarily that'll marry her.

1969
01:40:36,625 --> 01:40:38,417
That is, your focal point!

1970
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,208
Mani, I'm furious on you.

1971
01:40:40,208 --> 01:40:41,542
I'm not at all angry on you.

1972
01:40:41,542 --> 01:40:42,583
I feel so proud.

1973
01:40:42,583 --> 01:40:43,417
You got it now, isn't it?

1974
01:40:43,417 --> 01:40:45,375
Wait, you'll steal the jewels...

1975
01:40:45,667 --> 01:40:48,542
...and to take up the remaining property,
you'll marry that blind girl.

1976
01:40:48,542 --> 01:40:50,208
I'm the only person left alive
who knows the truth.

1977
01:40:50,208 --> 01:40:51,667
You'll kill me too.
-Hey...

1978
01:40:51,667 --> 01:40:53,292
I'll say that.

1979
01:40:53,292 --> 01:40:56,250
You'll tell that I died in railway crossing
as it happened to Kumar.

1980
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:57,417
Enquire well.

1981
01:40:57,417 --> 01:40:59,000
That Kathir might've killed Kumar.

1982
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,167
Similarly, you'll also kill me.

1983
01:41:00,167 --> 01:41:01,083
You've taken the bag, isn't it?

1984
01:41:01,083 --> 01:41:02,500
This bag, right?

1985
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:06,833
See well...

1986
01:41:08,167 --> 01:41:08,958
Nothing is in this bag.

1987
01:41:11,750 --> 01:41:14,542
Hey, you brought this bag
by mistake.

1988
01:41:14,542 --> 01:41:16,167
I know, what you'll say.

1989
01:41:16,167 --> 01:41:17,375
Don't act.
Where is the jewelry?

1990
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:18,583
Don't talk foolishly, Mani.

1991
01:41:18,583 --> 01:41:19,583
Are you dubious on me?

1992
01:41:19,583 --> 01:41:20,417
Dubious?

1993
01:41:20,417 --> 01:41:21,833
Your whole body
is accumulated of lies.

1994
01:41:21,833 --> 01:41:23,917
You lied about going to Theni,
saying that your father is a Zamindar.

1995
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:24,792
Everything was lie.

1996
01:41:24,792 --> 01:41:26,083
You're talking too much.

1997
01:41:26,083 --> 01:41:26,875
I'll talk like that only.

1998
01:41:26,875 --> 01:41:29,000
Your father is not a Zamindar.
He is a beggar.

1999
01:41:30,333 --> 01:41:33,042
Not only that,
your sister had eloped.

2000
01:42:00,167 --> 01:42:03,542
After one year...

2001
01:42:19,792 --> 01:42:21,292
Hey, come front.

2002
01:42:21,292 --> 01:42:22,083
Not you, sir.

2003
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:23,000
You sit there.

2004
01:42:23,417 --> 01:42:24,125
It's you...

2005
01:42:24,583 --> 01:42:25,667
Come front.

2006
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:38,375
Hello, Saravanan.

2007
01:42:38,583 --> 01:42:39,167
Tell me, sister.

2008
01:42:39,500 --> 01:42:41,833
The baby smiles at your image.

2009
01:42:42,833 --> 01:42:46,250
She won't let you go next time
when you come home.

2010
01:42:46,250 --> 01:42:47,292
Just wait a minute.

2011
01:42:49,458 --> 01:42:50,625
I'm getting a second call.

2012
01:42:50,625 --> 01:42:51,625
I'll call you later.

2013
01:42:51,625 --> 01:42:53,708
Okay, Saravanan.
-Hey dear, look at dad!

2014
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:54,917
I'm leaving to office.

2015
01:42:54,917 --> 01:42:58,250
Dear, uncle is coming home.
-take it, son-in-law.

2016
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:01,125
Come on, dear.

2017
01:43:01,125 --> 01:43:02,792
Come on...

2018
01:43:03,417 --> 01:43:06,833
Tell me,
-Are you coming home for lunch?

2019
01:43:06,833 --> 01:43:10,250
Yes, I'm coming for lunch
along with my friend.

2020
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:11,625
Cook for him too.

2021
01:43:11,875 --> 01:43:12,542
Okay.

2022
01:43:12,542 --> 01:43:13,708
I'll hang the call.

2023
01:43:13,875 --> 01:43:14,833
Okay dear.

2024
01:43:16,208 --> 01:43:18,000
It's been a year
since I met him.

2025
01:43:18,958 --> 01:43:21,917
Still he is dubious
and angry on me.

2026
01:43:22,375 --> 01:43:24,458
But, I'm not dubious on him.

2027
01:43:24,458 --> 01:43:26,167
Because, he isn't
that much intelligent.

2028
01:43:26,625 --> 01:43:29,208
But, on that night,
whatever he said about me...

2029
01:43:29,208 --> 01:43:30,833
...made me to realise myself.

2030
01:43:31,167 --> 01:43:31,708
Hey...

2031
01:43:32,583 --> 01:43:33,708
When will you start the vehicle?

2032
01:43:34,042 --> 01:43:35,000
Let the people come.

2033
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,708
Why are you in hurry?

2034
01:43:38,833 --> 01:43:42,833
To say the truth, I was staying away
not to meet him.

2035
01:43:43,208 --> 01:43:44,542
What happened on that night...

2036
01:43:44,542 --> 01:43:46,042
Get in.
You've place here.

2037
01:43:47,292 --> 01:43:47,833
Come this way.

2038
01:43:47,833 --> 01:43:49,000
Sir, keep your bag up.

2039
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:49,833
No, let it be here.

2040
01:43:49,833 --> 01:43:51,083
Sir, there's no place to sit.

2041
01:43:51,083 --> 01:43:51,667
Give the bag.

2042
01:43:51,667 --> 01:43:52,667
Keep it there.

2043
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,375
Sir, be seated.

2044
01:43:54,625 --> 01:43:55,833
Sit along with him.

2045
01:43:55,833 --> 01:43:57,250
Let the child sit on lap.

2046
01:43:57,250 --> 01:43:59,000
Dude, come back.

2047
01:44:23,292 --> 01:44:25,875
He'll kill me,
if I say the bag got changed.

2048
01:44:25,875 --> 01:44:27,958
That's why,
I wantedly fought with him.

2049
01:44:28,708 --> 01:44:31,667
Because, he will go in search
of the one who sat next to me.

2050
01:44:31,667 --> 01:44:33,542
I don't even remember that face.

2051
01:44:40,417 --> 01:44:42,042
Oh, no!
what's this?

2052
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,083
Show me.

2053
01:44:53,125 --> 01:44:54,000
Leave it.

2054
01:44:54,125 --> 01:44:55,375
It's for my dear daughter.

2055
01:44:57,125 --> 01:45:00,250
If god grants us,
it'll be like a blind luck.

2056
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:02,917
No need, we'll handover it
to the police.

2057
01:45:04,083 --> 01:45:08,375
I know how my father suffered
because of the police.

2058
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:12,875
Not only that, if something
comes to us on it's own...

2059
01:45:12,875 --> 01:45:14,708
...there'll be a justice.

2060
01:45:19,667 --> 01:45:21,750
I asked you to sit in front
to talk with me.

2061
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:24,000
Do you have a job or not?

2062
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,167
You're good enough
to get the support of in-law.

2063
01:45:29,667 --> 01:45:31,417
Didn't you leave
this reading habit yet?

2064
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:33,042
"I got the solution"

2065
01:45:33,042 --> 01:45:34,958
Only half of the book is remaining.

2066
01:45:35,417 --> 01:45:37,792
You don't know to read.
What are you doing with that?

2067
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,958
I too read by spelling out the letters.

2068
01:45:40,917 --> 01:45:42,375
"Mistakes..."

2069
01:45:46,375 --> 01:45:47,583
You stay with me.

2070
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:48,958
You drive the vehicle
for half of the day.

2071
01:45:49,667 --> 01:45:51,083
Agree to it.

2072
01:48:27,750 --> 01:48:30,000
