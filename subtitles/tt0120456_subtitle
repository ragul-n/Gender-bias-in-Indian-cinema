1
00:01:04,964 --> 00:01:07,762
There was a village in the world.

2
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,706
There was such a king.

3
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:34,058
Who was adored by everyone.
There was no one like him.

4
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:32,140
Everyone was extremely
happy in the village.

5
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:37,779
Their lives were full of
joy and love.

6
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:43,619
Each house was like his own house.

7
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:49,299
Everyone was equally
dear to him.

8
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:55,130
He used to share the
joys & sorrows of everyone.

9
00:02:55,508 --> 00:03:00,969
His presence was
a joy for everyone.

10
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,956
You were saying... That we'll be welcomed
grandly at the station.

11
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,727
Nobody is here.

12
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,163
This Joshpura.

13
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,398
Both the village & its
villagers are unique.

14
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,925
Greetings. - Greetings, welcome
...Junior boss.

15
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,598
Please accept our heart
felt affection.

16
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,673
Why did you stop?
Play... Play...

17
00:05:46,913 --> 00:05:47,538
Brother...

18
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:53,878
Come on dance.

19
00:05:56,422 --> 00:05:59,391
Brother, in the morning itself...

20
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:05,387
I was very happy that you are coming
...that's why 2 Pegs...

21
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,127
Shakti, who is she?
- She's Anita.

22
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:13,568
Anita, my elder brother...

23
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:16,233
Greetings.

24
00:06:16,943 --> 00:06:18,467
I had told you about him...

25
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:23,575
What's this? Such long
hair like girls.

26
00:06:24,283 --> 00:06:26,410
Brother this is the latest
style, Funk style.

27
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:28,921
Bunk... Petrol
filling station.

28
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,256
You keep quiet & put the
luggage in the car.

29
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:32,754
Shall we go brother...
- Take all the luggage...

30
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,417
Father told me to bring manure...
You go ahead, I'll come soon.

31
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,556
Give me car keys, I'll drive.
- I'm there to drive why should you?

32
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:46,170
I'll be driving in my village
after 5 years, its no joke.

33
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,865
You'll drive.
- Yes, I'll drive.

34
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,871
Tell me, one thing junior boss.

35
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,534
Who is this tall ladder like lady?
- Your sister-in-law.

36
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,040
Sister-in-law! You got
married in London!

37
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,216
Your would be sister-in-law.

38
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,944
Oh I see! I thought we'll have to
forgo marriage sweets. - Sit in car...

39
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:12,224
Grandpa, uncle has come...

40
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,730
Mother, come soon
uncle has come.

41
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,902
Greetings sir.
Greetings Junior Boss.

42
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,968
My respects father.
- May you live long son.

43
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,417
You've told father
haven't you?

44
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:49,931
Who is she?

45
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,265
She was studying with me in
the college, Anita... My...

46
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,001
Sister-in-law must've told you...

47
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,777
Hey... lt's alright...

48
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:05,943
Come children...

49
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,702
Father, sister-in-law is beating me.

50
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,148
Reform Gando.

51
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,310
Did you hear that, Balli?

52
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:45,019
Your uncle is welcoming
his son in such a way,

53
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:48,091
As if he hasn't returned from
foreign country but from the border,

54
00:08:48,294 --> 00:08:49,955
After winning the battle, give...

55
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,826
Too much wealth generates
extravagance father.

56
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,169
That's why, your elder brother is
burning the candle at both ends.

57
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,330
Burning is a crime in law...
And I can prove this in the court.

58
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,172
I don't remember the section
at the moment.

59
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,674
Greetings Junior Thakur.

60
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,507
You're belching Junior Thakur.
Somebody is remembering you.

61
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,677
Catch...

62
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,517
People who used to remember
me have died.

63
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:25,425
Those who're alive are
devising ways to kill me.

64
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,529
Are you my wife or enemy
send the younger one. Go...

65
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,534
Whole day, I remove your filth
tolerate your abuses,

66
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:37,368
And the younger one is
more affectionate to you.

67
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,869
Tell her... Tell that devil to clean your
filth for one day. Then, you'll know.

68
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,539
Oh Empress! Come down your
husband is calling you.

69
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,388
Junior Thakur, there is nothing
wrong in having 2 wives.

70
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,719
But keeping them under the
same roof... requires lot of gall...

71
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:58,329
God knows how you manage
both of them... by yourself...

72
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,896
Then what is the relevance of a Thakur.

73
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,069
You're a Thakur & I can
prove this in the court.

74
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,067
Section isn't coming to my
mind at the moment.

75
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,570
Lot of mosquitoes here.

76
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,743
The girl who has come with you...

77
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,276
Grandpa... - Careful
you'll fall...

78
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:19,574
Yes... Where does she belong to.
- Ludhiana.

79
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,246
But her daddy has settled in London
for the past 20 years. - Grandpa.

80
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,920
I had told sister-in-law everything...
- It's okay.

81
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,922
Did Narendra meet you?

82
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:30,091
He had come to the station. You had
sent him to bring manure, hadn't you?

83
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,092
He must be on his way back.

84
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,591
Not manure. He must have
gone to buy liquor.

85
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,763
Liquor in the day.

86
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,095
Day & night makes no
difference to an addict.

87
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:43,602
Listen, entire village is assembling
this evening to welcome you.

88
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,607
You get ready earlier
- Okay father.

89
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,773
And Shakti... - Yes.

90
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,945
Tell that girl to dress properly
- Okay, father...

91
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,861
Drums have started beating.

92
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,298
Village is being decorated.

93
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,131
Somebody has returned.

94
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:26,812
How many hues he
has brought with him?

95
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:33,421
He is our charmer.
- We'll swing & sing.

96
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,492
He is our friend our darling.

97
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,760
We'll swing & sing.

98
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,525
Oh Friend! Don't ever leave us & go.

99
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,196
We fall at your feet
with folded hands.

100
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,373
We won't allow you to break
our heart & go away.

101
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,558
Our prince has come.

102
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:47,221
Ruler of our hearts has come.

103
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:55,230
How many hues he
has brought with him.

104
00:12:55,941 --> 00:13:02,073
Our son has come...
We'll swing & sing.

105
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:09,918
Our heart is dancing.
We'll swing & sing.

106
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:46,114
It's like a heart which
is brimming with love.

107
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:59,462
My childhood companion,
my village...

108
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,306
Water of this well is very sweet.

109
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:22,661
The shade of these trees
is very soothing.

110
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:31,995
It's like music getting dissolved
in the breeze.

111
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:43,007
Please listen carefully the
sound of grinding stone.

112
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:52,522
Mellifluously it spreads
the music in a gentle rhythm.

113
00:14:53,893 --> 00:15:00,526
Chirping of birds are tuneful.

114
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:10,540
I've returned after years...

115
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:21,718
This is a century old song.

116
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:48,899
Father Anita.
- Sit down.

117
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:51,576
I'll eat with the ladies afterwards.

118
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:55,075
You don't need to
behave like other women...

119
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,246
I mean, you're our guest.

120
00:16:58,784 --> 00:16:59,751
Sit down.

121
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,932
Father you were saying something
about the land of betels.

122
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:25,937
Some agricultural experts had come
from France. What do you call them?

123
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,271
Horticulturists.

124
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,776
Yes, those people had come.

125
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,444
They were suggesting to grow
grapes on that land.

126
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,789
With that our farmers will
double their income.

127
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:42,626
I told them that my son has
gone to London for studies.

128
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:46,624
He'll take all the
decision on his return.

129
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:52,294
They started looking at me
in great amazement.

130
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,804
That the son of an uneducated farmer
has gone to London for studies.

131
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,473
I felt very proud about it.

132
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:05,576
So son. You take over the
management of this village.

133
00:18:05,684 --> 00:18:07,652
And give me pension.

134
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:14,782
But father, I... - Yes... Yes...
Go ahead I'm listening.

135
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:18,493
I want to do something
else father. - What?

136
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,002
I want to... Chain of fast
food restaurants...

137
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,672
What rent you want to open.

138
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:31,505
Restaurants, where people
eat and drink...

139
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:37,181
Huh! Tea shop. Is this a business?

140
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,350
It's a flourishing business
in cities these days.

141
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:43,351
It might be in city, but it has
no credibility in the village.

142
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:47,351
Further, how're villagers going
to be benefited by it.

143
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:50,361
Not in this village. - Then.

144
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,701
Jaipur, Delhi, Agra etc.

145
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:04,041
So you want to leave the village
& settle down in the city.

146
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,038
But how did you get interested
in this strange business?

147
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,911
Anita's daddy has same
business in London.

148
00:19:12,084 --> 00:19:13,381
He gave me this idea...

149
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:18,213
Does he know that she has
come here with you?

150
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,226
He only sent her.

151
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,056
Strange family.

152
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:32,067
Father, Anita's family has
a great reputation.

153
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,573
Anita's grandfather was
a freedom fighter.

154
00:19:37,142 --> 00:19:41,078
Now they've a factory in Ludhiana.
Her uncle is looking after it.

155
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:46,078
When you're so well informed
about her family...

156
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,911
You must've matched
her horoscope also.

157
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,585
And you must've decided about
the date of the marriage also.

158
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,589
Father... You... Me...

159
00:19:56,795 --> 00:19:59,593
Have you come to take my
permission or inform me?

160
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:04,931
Father, I had hoped that
you won't refuse.

161
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,600
I had written everything
to sister-in-law.

162
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,772
I see, sister-in-law also
knows everything.

163
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:15,939
So you've come to
tell me your decision.

164
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,287
What's your decision father?

165
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,294
Wash off my hands.

166
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:46,540
Yeah. - Your daddy embarked
on real bombardment. What now?

167
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,713
Infact, I was also thinking
about the same thing.

168
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,042
It's not that he can't be brought around.
But how to go about it.

169
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,549
Yeah. He seem to be a
real tough guy.

170
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,883
But outwardly he looks tough.
He has a very soft disposition.

171
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,559
Do you know, after the death of
my mother, he only brought me up.

172
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,727
And brother too.

173
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,720
How did we land up here
while talking.

174
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,694
Whose house is this?

175
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,229
My uncle's. Coming here
after a long time.

176
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,905
Who is it? - I'm Shakti, aunty.

177
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:17,772
Didn't you recognise me?

178
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,911
Shakti child, you.
- Yes, aunty, greetings.

179
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,418
May you live long
you're fine, aren't you?

180
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,845
With your blessings
I'm absolutely fine.

181
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:31,748
Shut up.

182
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,420
How did you come here?
...by plane?

183
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,595
Who is this boy with you?

184
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:50,597
She is not a boy, she is girl,
my friend... Anita.

185
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,940
Really! Be happy.

186
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:04,115
Who is outside?
- Nobody... Nobody is here.

187
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,949
Then, why is the dog barking?

188
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:10,623
It is hungry, that's why it's barking.
Why're you shouting?

189
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,457
You go, don't stay here
go from here, go...

190
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,966
Shakti, why've you come here?

191
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,135
Chotu, go and offer him
sweets, go...

192
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:30,140
Mother, Shakti took 2 laddoos.

193
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:34,485
Don't shout. - Mother Senior
mother is beating me.

194
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,983
Why do you hit me on the head?

195
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,487
If something goes wrong with my brain,
...Will you give me a penny?

196
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,652
Uncle doesn't like to see my face.

197
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,162
But aunty likes me a lot.

198
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,661
Then why was she telling to
go away again & again?

199
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,834
Otherwise, uncle would've
thrown her out.

200
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:54,672
Uncle feels that our family
is his enemy. - Why?

201
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:58,674
Why did 'Kauravas' consider
Pandavas their enemies?

202
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,678
Enemy! Inspite of
being a brother.

203
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:09,352
You took my photo madam.

204
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,086
Why? Shouldn't she have taken?

205
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,285
Obeisance to you Junior boss.
- Greetings.

206
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,462
Take, take as many
as you want, Yes...

207
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,025
Shakti, what's this?

208
00:23:24,803 --> 00:23:25,531
That's 'Rangoli'(colourful designs).

209
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,864
Its beautiful.
- Art in everyday life.

210
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:33,037
Strange smell is coming.

211
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,041
I've put poder(powder) on
the face. It must be its smell.

212
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,718
It's not good smell, its
bad smell, bitter smell.

213
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,879
Bad smell.

214
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:49,155
Oh yes, my head must be smelling
like that. I've applied "Neem oil".

215
00:23:49,694 --> 00:23:52,663
You also apply it, Lice
won't survive, really.

216
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:57,662
What is your name? - You didn't
recognise me Junior Boss.

217
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,166
I'm Gahna.

218
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:02,832
Remember when you were a kid
you used to learn to wield the stick.

219
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,842
One day you had broken my nose.

220
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:10,504
Oh Yes. I remember your nose
use to flow perpetually.

221
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,512
You're the daughter of
Naraindas? - Yes...

222
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,511
How is your father?

223
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,345
I'm alright, till now Junior boss.

224
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:19,852
But if Birju Thakur's
men see you here...

225
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:22,856
Then Balli Thakur will
deskin me. - Why.

226
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:29,026
Junior boss. In the war between
2 kings, only the subjects suffer.

227
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:33,034
My father was a farmer
under Birju Thakur.

228
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:35,035
We've always been obeying him.

229
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,041
He doesn't want that you...
- I got you... don't elaborate, greetings.

230
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,037
Lets go Anita.

231
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:57,889
Hey Shakti, that's good. - What?

232
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,857
Those people with the sticks there.

233
00:25:01,933 --> 00:25:03,560
You want to take some pictures.
- Yeah. - Come...

234
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:09,833
Junior boss... Junior boss
junior boss. - Be careful.

235
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,669
Where're you going that side.
- Anita wants to take some photos.

236
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:15,342
In that process some untoward
situation may arise.

237
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,515
You probably don't know. These're
Balli Thakur's fields.

238
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:18,683
Come to your area.

239
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:20,508
Come Shakti Thakur come.

240
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,849
You want to take some photos?
Go ahead... Do you remember?

241
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,225
We used to wield sticks
in childhood.

242
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,518
Yes, I remember very well.

243
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,696
Come lets have a small fight.
- Never...

244
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:37,363
Boss don't listen to him. He's trying
to rope you in a real fight.

245
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,196
Hey, will you shut up.

246
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:42,036
Don't be scared Shakti Thakur.
It won't be a real fight.

247
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,537
It'll be a friendly competition.

248
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:47,378
It's not the question of being afraid.
I've some work. Come...

249
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:51,215
I got it. You don't want to lose
your esteem infront of the girl.

250
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,213
Tell her to take photos & go.

251
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:55,545
Then, I'll show you the skill
of wielding the "Lathi".

252
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,878
Then, you show her
your prowess. - Hey.

253
00:25:57,088 --> 00:25:59,215
Do you know whom you're talking to?

254
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,886
If you insist then lets
have a bit of a fight.

255
00:26:03,094 --> 00:26:05,892
No... No... Boss listen to me.
Lets go from here.

256
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,395
You never leave the play ground
without playing.

257
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,297
That's the spirit. You'll fight
with the stick wearing a pant.

258
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:15,736
Surkhiya, lend me your "Dhoti".

259
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,906
What're you asking! Children are
watching. - Give me your dhoti.

260
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:22,238
Junior Boss my "Dhoti"...
- Are you giving or shall I pull it off...

261
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:23,914
Junior Boss my honour.

262
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,830
No point in measuring the stick
you should've the guts.

263
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,389
You're still a novice in "Lathi"
fight inspite of years of indulgence.

264
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,557
Practice...

265
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,554
His arrogance has met its waterloo.
Now give my "dhoti" back boss.

266
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,739
Junior boss! You aren't hurt
badly, are you?

267
00:27:54,939 --> 00:27:57,908
Hey coward, you attacked
from behind, you rouge.

268
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,077
You'll get hurt during
the fight with the brave.

269
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,247
If you don't want to fight
then play with that madam.

270
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,843
Let the rascal have it.

271
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,763
This temple has our family deity.

272
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,969
You mean this is your
family temple? - Yeah.

273
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,938
Yes... Yes... The same tempo... Tempo...

274
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,937
Forget the temple Junior boss.

275
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,943
It is just the same when you left here.
Lets go somewhere else.

276
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,308
Don't be daft, I want to see it.

277
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:22,613
If you want to see... See it
from here, it looks great, wow.

278
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:25,289
Same innocent face
of Goddess mother.

279
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,958
It has been years since. I've seen you,
salutations to you mother.

280
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,626
Shakti, brother has come to see you.

281
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,955
What did you say? You're blessing
him from there itself.

282
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:32,959
Blessed... Blessed... Let's go...

283
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,631
Hey... Hey... where're you going?

284
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,132
Open the door... Open the door
come on, open the door.

285
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,802
How to? Aren't you seeing
these two locks.

286
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:45,134
Small lock of Junior Thakur &
the big one of Senior Thakur.

287
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,976
What do you mean?

288
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,975
5 years ago both the
brothers quarreled.

289
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,808
In the Panchayat, both of them
sniped at each other like dogs.

290
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,984
From both the sides abuses were
hurled, sticks were wielded.

291
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,483
And you know for what?
To claim ownership of this temple.

292
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,320
Nothing came out of it.
Poor Goddess mother got locked in.

293
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:03,849
Man commits the crime &
God is punished. Shall we go.

294
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,663
Yes, go home & get the
key from father.

295
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:07,827
Key. - Yes...

296
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:10,667
Father's key will open our lock.

297
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,838
But their lock... - Do anything
but open this door.

298
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,664
You order me to do anything
but forget about opening this door.

299
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,341
That's all, you got flummoxed
for such a small matter.

300
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:25,346
You used to make munificent promises.
"Junior boss, I can sacrifice my life for you!"

301
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:30,749
I can sacrifice my life even now
but this temple affair is very tricky.

302
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,951
These are all lame-ass
excuses Surkiya.

303
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,618
I was a fool to have told Anita.

304
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,194
That we can give our life
but we never go back on our promises.

305
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,525
You've ruined my
reputation completely.

306
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,361
But boss. - Don't talk to me.

307
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,204
I'll get it in a jiffy.

308
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,380
If it leads to serious problem
then forget it Shakti.

309
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,549
How to forget it darling.

310
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,545
It is very important for you
to see this temple. - Why?

311
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,048
Because, we're going to get
married in this temple only.

312
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,225
Really. Then, I must see it.

313
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:13,728
Junior Boss. Please come here.
Just stand here.

314
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:18,065
Turn your face the other side...
Stay like this.

315
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,256
Why're you standing?
Pay homage to the deity.

316
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,424
Don't take long, make
it real fast.

317
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:10,951
We'll be married here.

318
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,117
In the centre here,
there'll be a "Havan Kund".

319
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:15,121
What "Kund"?

320
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,292
"Havan Kund" you're going
to put me in a mess someday.

321
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,464
"Havan Kund" in which the
fire will burn. - I see.

322
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:26,297
We'll go round it 7 times & promise
to be together, till death...

323
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,299
I'll have some dreams in
my eyes covered with flowers.

324
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,800
You'll have some dreams in your eyes,
covered by the veil.

325
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:36,311
...We'll never get separated.

326
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:50,994
If we do, my eyes will search
entire universe for you.

327
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:26,192
Stars are the members of
the marriage party.

328
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:30,356
Moon light is the marriage party.

329
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:44,543
We'll go round the fire 7 times
with our hands clasped.

330
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:52,383
We shall be life partners
like the wick & the lamp.

331
00:36:05,263 --> 00:36:12,635
When you're in my life.
I'll aspire for nothing else darling.

332
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:20,070
I worship you ordently
with my eyes.

333
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:34,914
Any word you say is
Holy commend to me.

334
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:55,394
What're you thinking?
- Nothing... I don't want to go.

335
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,803
Don't go, I didn't tell you to go.

336
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:02,075
I can't stay back also.
Daddy'll be waiting for me there.

337
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,747
I feel like crying...

338
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,745
I also feel like crying.

339
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:09,579
But, it's futile. Combination
of beard & tears isn't compatible.

340
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:10,913
Very funny.

341
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:18,087
Oh God! What's this nuisance?
- It's not closing.

342
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,765
I'll miss you Shakti.
- Even, I'll miss you.

343
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:31,767
When will you come?

344
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:34,274
I'll come soon. I'll stay
with father for 10-20 days.

345
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:38,437
20 days. - I mean, it'll take 10 days
to Cajole father.

346
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:43,609
As soon as, I get the permission
I'll & come to you, okay.

347
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:45,285
Now can I kiss you? - Please.

348
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,117
...I was closing the suitcase.

349
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,124
Babuji is calling you. - Both of us were
just about to come down.

350
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,821
He has called only you.
- Just me? - Hey... Hey... Hey...

351
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,797
Anita, not now... not now...

352
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,303
Coming father...

353
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:02,965
Hey, coming father...

354
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,142
Did you call me father?

355
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,489
Did you go to the temple?

356
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,316
Yes sir.

357
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,985
Why?

358
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,422
I wanted Anita to have a
glimpse of the family deity.

359
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,432
That's why, you broke its lock.

360
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,003
I told Surkhiya to bring the key.

361
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,509
I didn't anticipate
he'll break the lock.

362
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,669
It means, that when the lock
was broken... You were there.

363
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,579
Yes father... Yes.

364
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:50,582
Can't we visit our temple?

365
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,582
I accept, I made a mistake, but...

366
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,353
Wonderful son.

367
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:01,861
You did a great favour to me
by accepting your mistake.

368
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,366
Mr. Accountant. - Sir...

369
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:11,368
Tell them that its no use
amplifying the rukus.

370
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:16,035
If they so wish, I'm prepared to
apologise in the village assembly.

371
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,714
Father you...
- You keep quiet.

372
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:19,981
Because of your childishness.

373
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:22,379
There's a big uproar in the village,
do you know? Because of you...

374
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:23,553
Because of you?

375
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,723
What's it? I'm going.

376
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,154
What? - I'm going home. - Yes.

377
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,894
Father, the temple... - We'll talk
about the temple later.

378
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,896
Mr. Accountant, where is Surkhiya?
- Surkhiya will not come today.

379
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,565
You go and see her off.

380
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,564
Junior boss, don't go by the paved road.
- It'll be very circuitous otherwise.

381
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,970
Why don't you understand
what he says?

382
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,742
If you'll go that...

383
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,411
Will it hurt your pride
if you listen to him?

384
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,582
Junior Boss... Stop the car.

385
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,918
Don't go by this way Junior Boss.
Go by the culvert way.

386
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:07,256
Why? - Shankar, what's the problem?

387
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,494
Junior boss, the problem is
that our people,

388
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,497
Set fire to the huts of
Balli Thakur's fencers.

389
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,329
That's why, those people are
crying for our blood.

390
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,202
Burnt the huts? But why?
- Shall we be mute spectators?

391
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:20,169
For opening the door of
the temple, their goons...

392
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:21,503
Cut the hand of poor Surkhiya.

393
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,175
Cut the hand! Where is he?
- In the hospital.

394
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,351
He has lost lot of blood, but he'll live.
You go from here immediately.

395
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:30,179
Yes sir, you...

396
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:32,184
Come on, you sit in the car.

397
00:41:32,389 --> 00:41:34,687
What is happening Shakti?
- I don't know what's going on.

398
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,519
I don't know when man
will become human.

399
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,987
Get on the train.
- Shakti, take care of yourself.

400
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:06,986
And don't get involved
in any problem, okay.

401
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:13,486
I love you. - Bye... Bye...
Bye. - Take care...

402
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:16,495
Bye, take care. - Bye...

403
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,848
Oh God. - Greetings boss.
- Come Junior boss.

404
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,518
Surkhiya... Surkhiya...
Look, Junior boss has come.

405
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,357
Don't worry Junior boss.
Just now Senior boss had come.

406
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,857
He told the doctors that
Surkiya is very dear to him.

407
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,354
They should take special
care of him.

408
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:50,432
I'll chop them, I won't leave the creeps.
The moment I lay my hands.

409
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:52,035
Junior boss.

410
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:55,364
Lift me. - Lie down...
lie down. Leave him.

411
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:57,540
I'm sorry junior boss.

412
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:00,710
Because of that rascal, I couldn't
drop you both to the station.

413
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:04,039
As soon as I came out of the house. That
rascal came from behind & cut my hand.

414
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:07,380
I wasn't going to leave him.
I chased him...

415
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,884
But I bled so much that...
on the way...

416
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,382
Sister-in-law reached the
station in time, didn't she?

417
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,557
I committed a big mistake Surkhiya.
Forgive me.

418
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,558
What're you talking Junior boss?

419
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:24,223
I never thought that, because of me,
your life'll be spoiled.

420
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:28,735
Why do you worry Junior boss?
I'll deal with Jaswant.

421
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,405
Which Jaswant?
- Balli Thakur's pet dog.

422
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,142
This hand has been cut by
the sword of that rouge.

423
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,413
Did you register a
complaint in the police?

424
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,413
We don't bother to
involve the police.

425
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:43,587
Here justice is handed out by
the village assembly or God.

426
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,585
God has handed out his justice,
their huts were burnt.

427
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,918
This isn't God Justice.
It's their doings.

428
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,927
Wow, junior boss you came
to know the fact so soon.

429
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,928
You're a great CID.

430
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,936
Shut up, aren't you ashamed.

431
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:04,498
You behave like animals &
laugh heartily too.

432
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,442
Are you human beings or animals?

433
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,276
Greetings Junior boss.

434
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,285
Mr. Inspector what's all this?

435
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,783
Why doesn't police take action.

436
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,629
What can the police
do without proof?

437
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,958
The person whose hand is cut,
says it was cut in an accident.

438
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,634
Hut owners say that their
huts got burnt by the fire place.

439
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,138
I don't get a single witness,
single accused in this village.

440
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,669
I pray to God to transfer
me from here.

441
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:39,972
Register the FIR.

442
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,333
Come here.

443
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,175
Went to the hospital?

444
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,246
Yes father?

445
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:24,850
Did you see?

446
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,851
How expensive it is to visit
God in this village.

447
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,687
Now you got the picture
of this place.

448
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,860
I made a big mistake father.

449
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:40,696
And before I commit another serious
mistake. I must go away from here.

450
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:52,042
Instead of solving this problem.
You want to run away from here.

451
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,047
Is this not cowardice.

452
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,376
To kill for trifles
isn't bravery father.

453
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,721
Are these people human
beings or animals.

454
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:05,884
They want to solve all problems
by bloodshed & murder.

455
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:10,889
Your father is also
one of those animals.

456
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:16,630
From that angle, I'm also one.
But this is not a matter of pride.

457
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,909
By staying in centuries
old primitive village...

458
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,639
I don't want my education
to go waste.

459
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,572
Yes, we're primitive.

460
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:34,088
But I can't pin point the century we
belong to. You tell me.

461
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,593
People who've been poor &
slaves for 100's of years.

462
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,094
Who weren't considered
even human beings.

463
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:46,660
If they behave like animals.
What's so surprising about it?

464
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,339
You're educated, try to understand
their short comings.

465
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,279
And think, how to change
their our look.

466
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,444
It'll take a long time.

467
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,451
And you don't have that much time.

468
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,288
By that time, I may be dead.

469
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,684
Then die...

470
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,787
Aren't you ashamed to talk about
dying infront of your father.

471
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,787
Insolent, mannerless. Which branch of
education has taught you this?

472
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:35,641
You were one year old
when your mother died.

473
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:46,326
I spared no efforts to bring you up.
Day & night were of no consequence.

474
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,998
I wasn't educated.

475
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:54,160
But to educate you, I sent you to
Gwalior, London. With the only hope,

476
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:58,334
That when you return, you'll
teach us noble ways of life.

477
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:04,670
But I didn't know, that education
makes a man self serving.

478
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,683
You do anything you like.

479
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,686
Marry according to your choice.
Do business dear to you heart.

480
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:14,512
But don't forget your duty
towards your village & your land.

481
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,022
You've misunderstand me father.

482
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:22,695
I want to do alot for
the villagers & I'll do it.

483
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,029
I feel suffocated here.

484
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,702
I feel an alien in this place.

485
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,871
Please permit me to go
away from here father.

486
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,542
Mr. Accountant, come here.

487
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,654
Where has everyone disappeared?

488
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,218
I'm here boss.

489
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,056
Arrange for his ticket.
My dear son wants to go.

490
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,902
Shall I book it for 2 weeks later.

491
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:08,070
Did you hear what
Mr. Accountant is saying?

492
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:13,249
Come here.

493
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,429
Can't you stay with your
father for a few days.

494
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:38,597
For 20 days, 15 days, 10 days.

495
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:45,270
I also want to talk to you
hear you talk to me.

496
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:48,117
I was longing to see you.

497
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:55,451
Who knows, on your return your
old father may be alive or dead.

498
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,286
Why're you talking
like this father?

499
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,291
I'm not leaving you & going...

500
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:13,132
The moment business gets set.
I'll take you with me, yes father.

501
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:22,884
No, I was born here &
I'll die here.

502
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:30,422
Don't even try to pull out
my roots from here Shakti.

503
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:37,895
Have faith in me father. I'll do a
mighty lot for the villagers.

504
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,496
Except you who else is there,
worthy of my faith.

505
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:56,915
Who else is there in this
house besides you, go...

506
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:05,528
Careful son.

507
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:08,793
There was water...

508
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:35,554
All the villagers are informed
that the door of this temple,

509
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,225
Are being opened to visit &
worship the Goddess by everyone.

510
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:44,458
But because the Government is
pondering over the tangle of this temple.

511
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:48,067
Till the Government
comes to a decision.

512
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,104
District Collector will
over see its management.

513
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:57,109
It'll be a legal offense it any
villager interferes in temple affairs.

514
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:02,817
Mr. Collector you've ordered
the opening of the temple.

515
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:07,920
Please decide as to who'll be the first
to conduct the procession of the Goddess.

516
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,922
Otherwise, it'll we
a contentious issue.

517
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,429
There'll be a quarrel if you so decide
otherwise, why should it ensue.

518
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,098
At least keep God aloof from
your animosities.

519
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,434
Okay, Shakti, I'll make a move.

520
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,765
Vinay, come home since you've come
so far. - Have some refreshments.

521
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:26,431
Some other time Mr. Thakur
I've an urgent meeting today, okay.

522
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,939
Father about the dam...
- Mr. Collector. - Go back...

523
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,275
I've to discuss with you an important
matter. - Please tell me.

524
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:38,284
The dam near the village
has become very old.

525
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,452
It requires urgent repairs.

526
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:45,055
The wall on the western side
has developed even cracks.

527
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,792
Anything can happen any time.

528
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,959
Your officers come...
Inspect & go away.

529
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:54,633
But they don't do any tangible thing.
Please get some thing done.

530
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:57,136
I'll talk to the Minister
about it today itself.

531
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,305
Okay Greeting. - Greetings.

532
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,975
What is Shakti's plan?
- Chain of restaurants.

533
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,047
I'm trying to open some
kind of chain of restaurants.

534
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:09,115
I mean fast food restaurants.

535
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,819
I've to Cajole father.

536
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,153
Okay. - Okay wish you all
the best. - Thanks.

537
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,151
She won't listen. I had told you
not to play in the rain.

538
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,490
Suppose you catch old,
have fever...

539
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:25,334
That brat has hardly
come few days ago.

540
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,163
And the matters have swung
in their favour.

541
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,674
They're not swung
he has manipulated them.

542
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:38,007
Huts of our people were burnt
what did you do?

543
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:42,181
Burning of huts is a crime under the law
& I can prove it.

544
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,182
At the moment I don't
remember its section.

545
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,355
If you don't remember
then disappear from here.

546
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,352
They've brunt our huts.
We'll burn theirs.

547
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:55,357
During rains, fire doesn't
kindle, it extinguishes.

548
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,866
You are right father.

549
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:04,529
Water extinguishes the fire,
we'll respond to their fire with water.

550
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:21,720
Take it, take it.

551
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:33,732
Hey why are the goats so restless.

552
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,063
I'll go & check.

553
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,400
Laxmi, find out whether uncle
has returned or not?

554
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:50,912
Who is it?

555
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,851
Who is it? Why don't speak up.

556
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,596
Where are you running?
What are you people doing here?

557
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:16,938
What's happening? What's this noise?

558
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,790
What's this noise? - Come lets
go & check it... Come...

559
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,155
Run...

560
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,655
Dam has broken...

561
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:19,338
Dam has broken, entire
village'll get submerged.

562
00:57:50,300 --> 00:58:11,644
Junior boss we're ruined.

563
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:23,188
Whose child is this? Whose child is this?
Whose child is this?

564
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,211
My Munna.

565
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:51,282
My child has died...

566
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:58,883
My child... has died...

567
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:16,744
Save us...

568
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:13,961
You!

569
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:20,469
You're that one, you've broken
the dam you've killed my Munna.

570
01:01:20,677 --> 01:01:35,149
I'll not leave you. You've killed
my Munna, I'll kill you...

571
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,317
You've broken the dam you've
killed by Munna.

572
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:44,557
I'll not leave you.
You've killed my Munna...

573
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:11,643
Here is the criminal,
& I am the witness.

574
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:16,143
Thank you.

575
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:26,895
Get up.

576
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:34,631
Who else was there besides you.
- No one else was there sir.

577
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:38,136
I was alone sir,
I had put the gun-powder.

578
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:51,317
Bloody creep 5 people were seen there.
Where're the rest 4 tell me.

579
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:55,088
Believe me sir, no one
else was there.

580
01:05:00,363 --> 01:05:05,096
Tell me otherwise... - I told you sir,
no one else was there.

581
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,341
Greetings from Balli Thakur
Mr. Inspector- Greetings.

582
01:05:20,716 --> 01:05:23,514
You're one of those few who
received greetings from Balaram.

583
01:05:24,053 --> 01:05:24,678
Mr. Lawyer.

584
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,454
Here is his bail application.

585
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:32,861
He can't be bailed out- Why.

586
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:38,530
Because he has confessed his crime
that he blew up the dam.

587
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:50,542
Hey bloody fool. What was the
need of confessing.

588
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,044
And that too so soon.

589
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:07,229
We never knew that we were throwing
crumbs to such a murderer.

590
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:09,564
Otherwise we wouldn't have even
thought of bailing him out.

591
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:13,732
Rascal's like you should
be punished.

592
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:17,838
The one thought that is nagging me,
Is about your wife & children.

593
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:21,308
Who'll take care of them?
Who will tell me.

594
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:25,740
Okay. We'll look after them.

595
01:06:26,282 --> 01:06:28,250
Why're you rooted to the ground
let's go- Yes... Yes.

596
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:36,918
Junior boss, Balli Thakur's comments
are to be deeply pondered.

597
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:42,428
"I'll take care of his children".
It doesn't mean this but that.

598
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:44,925
Now it's very difficult to
get information from him.

599
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,261
All your labour has gone waste.

600
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,764
Labour is never wasted.

601
01:06:50,473 --> 01:06:53,670
If one criminal is punished. Other'll be
deterred from committing a crime.

602
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,778
Villagers will have
faith in justice.

603
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,607
What more do I want beyond this?

604
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:17,188
I couldn't bear their grief,
that's why I took a little...

605
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:20,933
You also have it.

606
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:24,937
As you like.

607
01:07:35,084 --> 01:07:36,881
Did you eat. - No.

608
01:07:37,586 --> 01:07:39,952
Why? - I don't feel like it.

609
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,286
Do you see that woman.

610
01:07:50,766 --> 01:07:53,166
She is the same mother
who lost her child.

611
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,070
Even then she is eating.

612
01:07:56,772 --> 01:08:01,402
Do you know why? So that she can take
care of her other child.

613
01:08:02,778 --> 01:08:05,178
A man has to keep alive
to help others.

614
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:12,417
Mr. Accountant... - 1, 2, 3, 4...
Coming sir.

615
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:15,917
When is my ticket booked for.
- For tomorrow.

616
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:17,986
Please cancel it.

617
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:19,693
If we cancel tomorrow's ticket...

618
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,659
Next reservation'll be very
difficult. Festivals are in vogue.

619
01:08:23,132 --> 01:08:25,100
Doesn't matter. - But.

620
01:08:31,307 --> 01:08:32,604
Father, I'm not going.

621
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:42,114
Mr. Accountant cancel... - Cancel.

622
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:48,684
Can I get a little salt?

623
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:57,697
Faithless person. To hell with
your advocacy.

624
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,635
You couldn't bail out a man.

625
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:04,332
Junior Thakur, he could've
been bailed out...

626
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:06,803
This time I've memorized all
the sections also.

627
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:11,844
But that Dhania ruined
all my efforts.

628
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:18,044
Reversal doesn't take long. You
don't worry. Next deal will be ours.

629
01:09:18,354 --> 01:09:20,481
Do we have to stay put
till the next deal.

630
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,484
We are Thakurs we
prefer death to defeat.

631
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,717
Let your enemies face death.

632
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:28,262
This time I'll take the
recourse to a section,

633
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:31,159
By which our crime
will not be proved,

634
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:33,995
And senior Thakur will
jump in such a manner.

635
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:38,833
As if some one had poured
boiling oil on his feet.

636
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:39,833
How?

637
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:42,340
What is the weak point
of senior Thakur?

638
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:43,674
What is it?

639
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:46,010
What is it?

640
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:48,748
Grief of the villagers.

641
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:26,380
Greetings.

642
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:27,214
What's the problem?

643
01:10:27,923 --> 01:10:32,724
Boss, without any provocation they
started putting the fence.

644
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:36,056
When we asked Narayan the
lawyer started quoting the law.

645
01:10:36,265 --> 01:10:40,224
Boss, if this way is blocked,
then we poor farmers will suffer a lot.

646
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:42,028
We'll have to take the
circuitous route via "Kasharpur",

647
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,034
to the vegetable market.

648
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,069
And it will night when
we reach there.

649
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:47,742
Next day who'll buy our
stale vegetables & fruits.

650
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:51,071
This way our children
will starve & die.

651
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:59,346
Father, shall I go & take care of them
...First take care of yourself.

652
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,917
Sir you don't go there alone.

653
01:11:05,961 --> 01:11:09,089
All of you stay here.
Shakti come.

654
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:25,511
Hey lawyer.

655
01:11:25,814 --> 01:11:30,774
Oh senior Thakur,
respectful greetings...

656
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:32,612
What's all this?

657
01:11:33,489 --> 01:11:33,955
This!

658
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:38,282
The legal owner of this land wanted
to protect his property.

659
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:43,295
From trespass transgression
hence fence.

660
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:51,534
Look we're not concerned with
your intentions & modalities.

661
01:11:52,341 --> 01:11:55,139
But we like to know what legal
right you've,

662
01:11:55,511 --> 01:11:58,878
to say that a fence is required.

663
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:07,982
Now you are satisfied listening
to English. Now speak in Hindi.

664
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:10,415
Or you don't know Hindi.

665
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:13,321
No such things.
National language, long live.

666
01:12:13,862 --> 01:12:16,660
The owner of this land wanted to fence it
so I got it done.

667
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:26,838
The owner of this land is Narayan.
And I gave this land to Narayan.

668
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:31,342
Narayan? Is this fence put up
with your consent?

669
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:33,511
No boss, these people...

670
01:12:34,883 --> 01:12:39,843
When Ghana's mother was sick Narayan
mortgaged this land to Balli Thakur.

671
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:44,355
Even now the papers
are with Balli Thakur.

672
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:48,860
Father it seems they've taking
advantage of Narayan's helpless.

673
01:12:49,732 --> 01:12:53,361
They're using the legal thumbscrew.
We'll take this case to the court.

674
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:56,261
Why to the court?

675
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:59,374
Disputes of this village
aren't settled by the court.

676
01:13:00,075 --> 01:13:01,542
But by the village assembly.

677
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:07,208
Narayan tomorrow morning at 7.
Be present in the village assembly.

678
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:09,217
Let's go.

679
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,102
We got a bit late.

680
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,108
'Not a bit'. You are late
exactly by 1 hour.

681
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:18,284
Thakur is not governed by time, time
it governed by Thakur.

682
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,786
Please start village headman.

683
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,117
You start sir.

684
01:14:25,160 --> 01:14:28,960
Is this village assembly or
an assembly of misconduct.

685
01:14:29,164 --> 01:14:32,565
Members we don't have time
to waste, come to the point.

686
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:36,134
Yes we must talk about the point.

687
01:14:37,172 --> 01:14:42,474
Point is that on the entire land of this
village. Each farmer has the same right.

688
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:44,972
As every son has on his mother.

689
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:48,649
I would like to ask Narayan that
on what grounds,

690
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:50,250
he has stopped the
passage of the villagers.

691
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:53,383
That passage which is for the
improvement of the villagers,

692
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:55,557
That passage which is
for their well-being.

693
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:58,191
That passage which is their life-line.

694
01:14:59,695 --> 01:15:02,493
I saw Narayan going to-wards
Kasharpur in the morning.

695
01:15:02,698 --> 01:15:04,996
I'll give a reply to
this & not Narayan.

696
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:09,667
This is the power of attorney
given to me by Narayan.

697
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:12,500
His thumb impression
is there on it.

698
01:15:12,875 --> 01:15:14,843
I don't accept this power
of attorney.

699
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,401
It doesn't have the impression
of his willingness.

700
01:15:17,613 --> 01:15:19,080
But the impression of his helplessness.

701
01:15:19,882 --> 01:15:22,510
And to take advantage forcibly
of someone's helplessness.

702
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:25,846
And to present it as
legal evidence.

703
01:15:26,221 --> 01:15:28,849
This is a very convenient ruse
these days, village head.

704
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:33,755
In my opinion, this piece
of paper has no relevance.

705
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,530
Members of the assembly,
how do you view this.

706
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:38,958
A piece of paper,
or legal document?

707
01:15:40,402 --> 01:15:43,860
In view of we assembly members.
The real reason for this dispute,

708
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,872
is the animus between the
senior and junior Thakur.

709
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,873
Welfare of the village lies,

710
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:52,372
in the compromise of
both the brothers.

711
01:15:52,748 --> 01:15:55,216
Senior Thakur. Would you
like to comment on this.

712
01:15:55,417 --> 01:16:00,377
Village head. Entire village knows that
I'm not averse to compromise.

713
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:05,223
I am prepared to compromise even
today. But on one condition.

714
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:08,562
That fence has to be
removed from there.

715
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:12,893
In return, I'm prepared to
pay any price.

716
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:19,571
We're not starving, to feed
ourself by selling the land.

717
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:22,073
This case will be decided not by
the village assembly but by the court.

718
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:26,236
Till date no Thakur of Joshpura
has stepped in the court.

719
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,246
Nor he'll ever.

720
01:16:31,787 --> 01:16:36,918
Thakurs don't accept a girl
his daughter-in-law.

721
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:43,087
Who, before marriage, Come to the
in-law's place & celebrate nuptials.

722
01:16:43,298 --> 01:16:43,923
Uncle.

723
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:46,767
This is our personal affair, father.

724
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,766
Raising it in the village assembly...
- You keep quite.

725
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,438
There is a limit to everything.

726
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:54,105
I'll not allow them to
character assassinate a decent girl.

727
01:16:56,311 --> 01:17:01,044
Foreign return is a hot
tempered person, Balli.

728
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:04,281
Beware uncle. - I told you
to keep quiet.

729
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:07,279
For the last time I'll request
the village assembly.

730
01:17:07,489 --> 01:17:08,649
To give their verdict.

731
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,618
Why are you referring to
village assembly all the time.

732
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:12,293
As if a street dog is barking.

733
01:17:12,494 --> 01:17:15,463
Balli! - Junior boss...

734
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:16,961
What will be the difference
between them & us.

735
01:17:19,001 --> 01:17:24,462
Members. This impertinent is talking
nonsense & you're keeping quiet.

736
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:25,807
What are you doing?

737
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:31,309
Listen Balram. I wanted the
village assembly to decide.

738
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:34,213
Because I had placed
them in high esteem.

739
01:17:34,683 --> 01:17:36,981
But I never thought that I've
come to a wrong place.

740
01:17:37,185 --> 01:17:40,552
I've no respect here.
Nobody has regards for me here.

741
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,658
Let's go Shakti, let's go.

742
01:17:45,027 --> 01:17:48,224
I can't stay with these brutes
even for a moment.

743
01:17:51,366 --> 01:17:53,163
You're running away from the
battle field cowards.

744
01:17:53,368 --> 01:17:54,562
At least blacken your face.

745
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:58,661
Hold you tongue Balli,
hold your tongue. - Come.

746
01:17:59,207 --> 01:18:02,665
The game has started only now.
See what happens in the future.

747
01:18:02,878 --> 01:18:05,176
What the hell. - Let's go.

748
01:18:05,380 --> 01:18:08,679
You may be able to tolerate father
but I can't.

749
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:11,011
I'll kill that bastard
I'll kill him...

750
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:12,686
Hey, you foreign returned.

751
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:16,513
Have you left behind your valour
what'll happen to your miss.

752
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:18,022
They want bloodshed in
the village assembly.

753
01:18:18,226 --> 01:18:20,854
I don't want the car.
They're provoking us.

754
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:24,596
Remove this.

755
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,259
Boss what'll we do now?

756
01:18:28,737 --> 01:18:32,696
Don't ask me. I want to distance
myself from your tumults.

757
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:36,036
I'm fed up, relieve me.

758
01:18:36,745 --> 01:18:39,043
What to do and what not to do?
I know nothing.

759
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:40,874
You just order boss.

760
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:43,210
I'll chop the heads of those
rascals & place them at your feet.

761
01:18:43,418 --> 01:18:45,545
Hey, you shut up. A great one
to chop their heads!

762
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,881
Always blabbering.

763
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,290
Yes father. - You were right.

764
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:55,563
These people can't think of
anything else except violence.

765
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:57,899
You wanted to go, didn't you? Go...

766
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:01,891
If you stay amidst these animals,
You'll also become one like them.

767
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:03,731
You cool down father
I don't want to go anywhere.

768
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:06,908
You wanted to start that
that uncouth thing...

769
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:09,737
Tea shop... Go and open that.

770
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:13,073
Take out of them with you
fix them in some jobs.

771
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:17,407
Those people won't let them live. They
won't allow them to cultivate peacefully.

772
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,913
They fight amongst themselves & die.

773
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,249
Don't be distressed father...
You've lost your discretion in anger.

774
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:25,585
What nonsense are you talking
Why should I be angry?

775
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:27,921
Only that man gets angry.

776
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:33,659
Who has shame, modesty, self esteem.
What do I have?

777
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:39,267
That impertinent brat
has neutralized all of it.

778
01:19:39,808 --> 01:19:43,676
In a jiffy, leave me...

779
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:59,090
Father... Father... take care...
- Nothing has happened to me.

780
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:04,660
I'm perfectly alright. All of you go
from here. Leave me alone.

781
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:55,809
Grandpa are you angry?

782
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:59,487
No child, my body is paining.

783
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,982
Then you sleep grandpa
I'll press you. - No, I'll press.

784
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:05,057
No, I'll press. - No, I'll press.

785
01:21:05,694 --> 01:21:09,994
My children, your grandpa's
body is quite big.

786
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:12,993
All of you can jointly, press it.

787
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,336
Then you lie down. - Alright.

788
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:29,074
Will you sing a song for grandpa.
- Which one grandpa?

789
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,678
About the king...

790
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:40,525
"He was dwelling in
everyone's heart."

791
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:43,364
Oh! You innocent girl
from the beginning.

792
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:52,029
"He was dwelling in everyone's heart".

793
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:57,868
No, I told you from the beginning.
- How grandpa?

794
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:09,449
"There was a village which"...

795
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:15,227
Yes, Bravo now all of you
sing like that.

796
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:31,070
"There was a village
which had such a king".

797
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:37,745
"He was dwelling in
everyone's heart".

798
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:45,920
There was no one like him...
Grandpa...

799
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,110
Mother...

800
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:09,783
Mother...

801
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:16,780
Father...

802
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:22,453
Mother... Come soon...
- See, what happened to grandpa?

803
01:23:23,331 --> 01:23:28,530
Mother... Mother...
- Get up grandpa...

804
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:45,817
"Dream of the life".

805
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:55,562
"Got shattered one day".

806
01:23:56,364 --> 01:24:10,506
"Closing his eyes,
he abandoned everyone".

807
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:18,009
"His memories can't be erased".

808
01:24:18,386 --> 01:24:25,519
"They make us cry, they haunt us".

809
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:32,929
"It became dark as soon
as he departed".

810
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:41,869
"Everything there, says this".

811
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:27,080
Shakti, Shakti.
- What's it brother?

812
01:26:27,482 --> 01:26:31,976
Letter... letter. - From whom?
- Come here.

813
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,754
By the fragrance,
I think it's from her.

814
01:26:40,995 --> 01:26:42,257
It's from her, isn't it?

815
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:43,596
Let him read the letter.

816
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:47,030
Read loudly.

817
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:50,632
I'm angry because you informed me
about your father's death so late.

818
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:54,135
Give my love to Surkhiya
& greetings to you & sister-in-law.

819
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:54,841
Did you see that?

820
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:58,308
She cares so much about us
from now itself and you...

821
01:26:58,913 --> 01:26:59,436
What happened?

822
01:26:59,681 --> 01:27:01,342
Look how many hands are shaking?

823
01:27:01,583 --> 01:27:03,551
You've put Surkhiya to spy on me.

824
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:05,412
He stands outside the bathroom
when I take bath.

825
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:06,848
Brother, you've promised me.

826
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:10,047
Yes Shakthi, but sometimes a peg.
- Not a drop.

827
01:27:10,558 --> 01:27:11,820
It's a matter of our prestige.

828
01:27:12,227 --> 01:27:17,790
Okay... Go... go... go... go...
This road is closed.

829
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:28,031
Dhania junior boss's paper has
flown away.

830
01:27:28,977 --> 01:27:31,537
Bring it fast. Go & catch it quickly.
Bring it.

831
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:34,875
Greetings, junior boss.
- Greetings.

832
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,110
Take it.

833
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:42,287
Junior boss, I see Senior Boss
in you.

834
01:27:43,458 --> 01:27:45,892
This fence has taken his life.

835
01:27:47,829 --> 01:27:50,320
Bring it fast.
- Bringing father.

836
01:27:50,531 --> 01:27:53,466
Junior boss. This girl is
responsible for all problems.

837
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,897
I'm having this land to gift it
as dowry in her marriage.

838
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:59,801
Or else I would've sold it &
left the village long back.

839
01:28:00,108 --> 01:28:03,305
At least I wouldn't become a
problem for the villagers, junior boss.

840
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:07,743
The road is right in front.
But the villagers can't use it.

841
01:28:08,349 --> 01:28:10,044
I'm clue less.

842
01:28:14,756 --> 01:28:16,189
Greetings, junior boss.
- Greetings.

843
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:27,357
Bloody dog, rascal.

844
01:28:28,903 --> 01:28:31,030
What were you talking with him
standing near the fence?

845
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:35,539
I'm putting an end to our relationship,

846
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:37,676
And you're cultivating it.

847
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:42,347
I'll cut your tongue if you
dare to talk to him again.

848
01:28:42,684 --> 01:28:43,844
Get lost from here. Go.

849
01:28:48,356 --> 01:28:52,383
Balli. - What's it?
- Put me in the chair.

850
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:57,688
Elder brother came in
my dreams yesterday.

851
01:28:58,733 --> 01:29:02,066
He told me twice,
very affectionately.

852
01:29:02,603 --> 01:29:05,071
'Birju you also come'.

853
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,467
He doesn't leave us alone even
after his death.

854
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:09,071
Scoundrel.

855
01:29:24,525 --> 01:29:26,152
Junior boss at this time, here?

856
01:29:30,031 --> 01:29:31,225
Greetings, junior boss.

857
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:32,958
Greeting Ram Narayanan uncle.

858
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,063
I want to talk to you.

859
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:39,162
Uncle, it's about the
welfare of the village.

860
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:42,709
What's the use of telling me,
junior boss?

861
01:29:43,544 --> 01:29:44,670
If you have something to talk,
go & talk to them.

862
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:48,510
If he comes to know than,
I'll be in trouble.

863
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:50,943
Don't drag me into this
problem, for God's sake.

864
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,150
Even if concerns Gehna's alliance.
- About alliance.

865
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:57,052
What do you mean?

866
01:29:57,325 --> 01:30:00,522
I've seen a boy of our side for her.

867
01:30:01,195 --> 01:30:02,662
The boy is good in all aspects.

868
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:05,732
What about the dowry?
- Nothing.

869
01:30:06,467 --> 01:30:08,731
You have to remove the fence only.

870
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:14,636
Oh God! I can't do it, junior boss.
I'll be beheaded.

871
01:30:15,443 --> 01:30:17,070
I'll take the responsibility
of your head.

872
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,972
I swear on my father that
no harm will come to you.

873
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:25,014
Don't think that you've
become landless.

874
01:30:25,753 --> 01:30:29,052
In return I'll give you the
fertile land near the canal.

875
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:30,452
Twice in area.

876
01:30:30,925 --> 01:30:33,189
It's okay, but the shadow
of fear will be there.

877
01:30:33,594 --> 01:30:34,458
Let's do one thing.

878
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:36,492
We'll consult Balli's mother.

879
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:38,125
Then, nothing will work out.

880
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:41,733
We've to take the decision
and right now.

881
01:30:46,040 --> 01:30:49,407
Look uncle Narayanan, I trust you.

882
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,672
You'll never go back
on your promise.

883
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,811
Do you have faith me or not?

884
01:30:54,749 --> 01:30:55,977
I'm the son of Raja Thakur.

885
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:57,777
I'll give my life to
keep up a promise.

886
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:00,348
Yes, you'll.

887
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:10,453
Mohan. - Yes sir.

888
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:12,129
He's the boy.

889
01:31:13,201 --> 01:31:17,228
Mohan, tell uncle Narayanan that
you're ready to marry Gehna.

890
01:31:17,505 --> 01:31:20,838
I'm ready, junior boss.
I'll give my life for you.

891
01:32:19,467 --> 01:32:22,436
"Listen uncle & aunty"

892
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:27,603
"Listen, oh my uncle & aunty"

893
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:32,408
"Listen, oh my uncle & aunty"

894
01:32:34,081 --> 01:32:37,380
"We've won the battle"

895
01:32:39,287 --> 01:32:48,594
"The enemy who was a hurdle till
yesterday has lost to us"

896
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:53,930
"Gone are the days when
we lived in sorrows"

897
01:32:54,135 --> 01:32:58,504
"It's a fair of joy,
let's celebrate it"

898
01:33:52,026 --> 01:33:56,690
"The girl will go to husband
house as bride"

899
01:34:02,036 --> 01:34:06,666
"She'll be well decorated &
swing in her imagination"

900
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:21,212
"She'll go to another place & set
her home with her husband"

901
01:34:21,589 --> 01:34:30,759
"Don't know whether she'll remember
or forget us"

902
01:34:31,165 --> 01:34:35,864
"But the villagers will wait for her"

903
01:34:36,070 --> 01:34:40,700
"See, she has come to the
village smilingly"

904
01:36:17,204 --> 01:36:18,228
Welcome the head of
village assembly.

905
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:20,202
Congratulation Narayanan.
You're happy now.

906
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:21,499
It's God's mercy.

907
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:25,409
Surkhia, bring the garland fast.
- Coming.

908
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:27,808
Are you bringing the garland now?
- This is a garland of victory. Your Victory.

909
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:28,980
You were saying something...

910
01:36:37,591 --> 01:36:39,821
Priest, Is everything ready?

911
01:36:41,428 --> 01:36:43,293
- Yes good morning.
Good morning Inspector.

912
01:36:43,497 --> 01:36:45,931
I've put my men to guard the place.
- Thank you very much.

913
01:36:46,133 --> 01:36:47,430
Mr. Account, take care of him.
- Yes sir.

914
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:48,533
I'll be back soon.

915
01:36:48,903 --> 01:36:49,767
I'll just see you.

916
01:36:49,970 --> 01:36:51,198
Greetings, Inspector.

917
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:56,136
The marriage is being conducted
in a grand manner in the temple.

918
01:36:56,343 --> 01:36:59,574
Shakti Thakur has organised
a feast for the entire village.

919
01:37:00,114 --> 01:37:01,103
The funny part is,

920
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:04,910
They've called both the music band
& the Police.

921
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:07,243
Our bullet will be fired
without a gun.

922
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:09,786
It's not against the Law to
fire a bullet without a gun.

923
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:12,254
And I can prove this in the Court.

924
01:37:12,459 --> 01:37:14,256
The funniest part of this is...

925
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:16,555
I also know the sections.

926
01:37:18,899 --> 01:37:20,560
Hey stop... stop. Come here.

927
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:21,291
Where are you going?

928
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:22,059
Why are you going inside?

929
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:23,736
To give this letter to the Junior boss.

930
01:37:23,938 --> 01:37:24,666
Do you want to give the letter?

931
01:37:24,872 --> 01:37:26,396
Go... go... I'll give it to him. Go... go...

932
01:37:29,443 --> 01:37:31,308
Go... go fast...

933
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:34,047
Where's the Junior Boss?
- Sitting over there.

934
01:37:34,248 --> 01:37:35,272
Junior Boss, a letter for you.

935
01:37:36,116 --> 01:37:38,050
Who gave it?
- A small boy.

936
01:37:39,253 --> 01:37:40,311
He was here...

937
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:41,347
Where has he gone?

938
01:38:03,844 --> 01:38:05,709
What's the problems, Shakti?

939
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:08,073
You read it.

940
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:13,018
Mohan's greeting to Junior Boss.

941
01:38:13,954 --> 01:38:17,287
Thanks for selecting me as the groom.

942
01:38:17,725 --> 01:38:21,161
But poor people like me don't consider
ourselves fit for this marriage.

943
01:38:21,428 --> 01:38:24,522
Because anyone who marries
Narayanan's daughter,

944
01:38:24,732 --> 01:38:28,293
Will become the scapegoat in the
rivalry of you rich people.

945
01:38:29,003 --> 01:38:32,700
May be the bride is brave enough
to risk her life.

946
01:38:32,940 --> 01:38:36,376
But I'm not brave enough
to risk my life.

947
01:38:37,111 --> 01:38:39,739
So, I'm breaking my promise &
leaving the village

948
01:38:39,947 --> 01:38:41,244
I am going to the city.

949
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:50,247
Did you see that, Junior Boss?

950
01:38:51,358 --> 01:38:54,555
How much tyranny you've
done to father & daughter.

951
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:57,530
The entire village knows,

952
01:38:57,731 --> 01:39:00,063
That my daughter is getting
married to Mohan.

953
01:39:00,301 --> 01:39:03,930
But that rascal run away
from the village.

954
01:39:04,338 --> 01:39:05,600
I've lost my honour.

955
01:39:05,973 --> 01:39:08,066
My daughter's life has been ruined.

956
01:39:09,176 --> 01:39:10,541
Have courage Uncle Narayanan.

957
01:39:10,744 --> 01:39:12,302
How to be courageous?

958
01:39:12,513 --> 01:39:14,845
I removed the fence on your advice.

959
01:39:15,049 --> 01:39:17,643
I've made Balli Thakur my
enemy for my entire life.

960
01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:21,153
It's our lives which is in danger.

961
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:28,425
Mr. Accountant- Yes, Junior boss.

962
01:39:31,432 --> 01:39:34,765
Go & bring Nathu.
Tell him to come immediately.

963
01:39:35,035 --> 01:39:37,094
Uncle Narayanan, this marriage will be
conducted today.

964
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:41,570
I won't get my daughter married to
any man roaming on the street.

965
01:39:41,775 --> 01:39:44,209
Because, if he too writes
a letter & flees from village, then?

966
01:39:44,945 --> 01:39:47,539
I made a grave mistake
by believing you.

967
01:39:47,748 --> 01:39:50,012
I must slipper my self.

968
01:39:58,892 --> 01:40:01,360
Why're you crying at your fate,
let's go...

969
01:40:01,562 --> 01:40:04,030
You're very unfortunate.

970
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:06,062
No one asked my consent.

971
01:40:08,035 --> 01:40:11,198
You all made a decision.

972
01:40:12,940 --> 01:40:17,309
If my mother was alive,
I wouldn't have been in this situation.

973
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:21,141
It's a house without a woman.

974
01:40:22,216 --> 01:40:24,047
That's why, I'm in this precarious situation

975
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:27,715
Now I'll die.

976
01:40:30,090 --> 01:40:32,957
I'll drown myself in
some well or pond.

977
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:34,855
Why only you?

978
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:36,723
Whom should I live for?

979
01:40:36,964 --> 01:40:39,432
Anyway Baljit Thakur will
never leave me alive.

980
01:40:39,666 --> 01:40:40,655
Come, let's go.

981
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,337
Uncle Narayanan, stop.

982
01:40:48,208 --> 01:40:49,732
What'll happen if I stop?

983
01:40:51,779 --> 01:40:53,610
Uncle Narayanan, let's think
and find a way out.

984
01:40:57,217 --> 01:40:59,242
What's there left to think?

985
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:05,518
Junior boss, answer my
only question.

986
01:41:06,193 --> 01:41:10,459
You said that you're
son of Raja Thakur.

987
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:13,029
And you'll sacrifice your life
to keep up a promise.

988
01:41:13,567 --> 01:41:15,091
What happened to your promise?

989
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:17,469
Our lives are in danger.

990
01:41:25,546 --> 01:41:26,342
Listen.

991
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:28,272
You don't have to be
afraid of anyone.

992
01:41:28,482 --> 01:41:30,074
Police will protect you.

993
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:34,376
Sir, if police had given
proper protection,

994
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:36,985
Why would these
atrocities happen?

995
01:41:38,292 --> 01:41:39,190
Let's go.

996
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:40,991
Stop uncle Narayanan.

997
01:42:06,053 --> 01:42:08,248
I accept that I made a
grave mistake.

998
01:42:10,290 --> 01:42:14,852
I was foolish to sacrifice others
lives for the sake of villagers.

999
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:20,499
I didn't invite you & your
daughter here to get insulted.

1000
01:42:22,736 --> 01:42:26,900
I didn't remove the fence
to keep my head high.

1001
01:42:27,508 --> 01:42:29,066
And to put Balli down.

1002
01:42:30,844 --> 01:42:33,677
My only goal is villager's happiness.

1003
01:42:35,048 --> 01:42:36,538
I'm the son of Raja Thakur.

1004
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:39,016
And I'll sacrifice my life
to keep up my promise.

1005
01:42:39,653 --> 01:42:40,950
I didn't lie.

1006
01:42:45,192 --> 01:42:46,523
Your mother is dead.

1007
01:42:47,928 --> 01:42:49,452
That's why, you're in unenvious state.

1008
01:42:50,564 --> 01:42:54,125
And no one asked for your
approval, isn't it?

1009
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:57,268
But don't think like that?

1010
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:00,802
I'm asking you.

1011
01:43:03,610 --> 01:43:06,272
Do you've any objection
in marrying me?

1012
01:43:14,121 --> 01:43:14,644
Tell me.

1013
01:43:21,762 --> 01:43:25,664
Junior Boss, what can
this poor girl say?

1014
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,356
Luck has smile don her.

1015
01:43:27,901 --> 01:43:30,199
Dear, touch his feet.

1016
01:43:43,383 --> 01:43:48,218
"Enlighten your hubby's home."

1017
01:43:48,422 --> 01:43:57,990
"You become the lamp of
love & brighten his life."

1018
01:43:58,265 --> 01:44:12,737
"Be with your hubby in times
of sorrows or happiness"

1019
01:44:12,946 --> 01:44:22,617
"Our blessings are with you"

1020
01:44:22,823 --> 01:44:32,323
May your marriage
be successful on bride.

1021
01:45:24,351 --> 01:45:27,184
Are you our new aunty?

1022
01:45:27,387 --> 01:45:30,686
My uncle has married
you only, hasn't he?

1023
01:45:31,925 --> 01:45:33,324
Will you give us those flowers?

1024
01:45:33,527 --> 01:45:34,653
Enough. Don't trouble her.

1025
01:45:34,861 --> 01:45:36,158
Let your aunty come inside.

1026
01:45:37,197 --> 01:45:37,925
Come inside.

1027
01:46:03,256 --> 01:46:03,881
Milk.

1028
01:46:06,026 --> 01:46:06,856
No need.

1029
01:46:07,561 --> 01:46:10,029
You must drink, it's the custom.

1030
01:46:19,973 --> 01:46:23,101
You should've left something
for me too.

1031
01:46:23,844 --> 01:46:24,902
It's a custom.

1032
01:46:26,346 --> 01:46:27,404
I drank fully.

1033
01:46:28,482 --> 01:46:29,744
It's alright.

1034
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:31,641
Sit down.

1035
01:47:20,333 --> 01:47:21,925
Did he drink the entire milk? - Yes.

1036
01:47:22,803 --> 01:47:24,134
He has studied in a foreign country.

1037
01:47:24,738 --> 01:47:26,729
So, he doesn't know about
customs & traditions.

1038
01:47:27,340 --> 01:47:28,238
What happened then?

1039
01:47:29,142 --> 01:47:31,576
Then... this happened...

1040
01:47:48,028 --> 01:47:49,791
Anita, how'll
make you understand...

1041
01:47:51,231 --> 01:47:53,096
He thinks about her very much.

1042
01:47:53,300 --> 01:47:54,767
Don't lose heart.

1043
01:47:55,168 --> 01:47:59,605
You're so cute that Shakti
will forget her very soon.

1044
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:01,865
Go & make tea for him.

1045
01:48:02,709 --> 01:48:04,734
If he doesn't like the tea
prepared by me!

1046
01:48:05,512 --> 01:48:06,604
You prepare it.

1047
01:48:06,813 --> 01:48:08,041
No, you prepare it.

1048
01:48:08,348 --> 01:48:12,011
You must know about his likes
dislikes & everything else.

1049
01:48:12,352 --> 01:48:15,048
Now, you must take care of him.
Understood?

1050
01:48:15,255 --> 01:48:16,847
Go & make tea.

1051
01:48:18,325 --> 01:48:19,724
Greeting Junior Boss.

1052
01:48:19,926 --> 01:48:21,291
Registered letter for you.

1053
01:48:50,023 --> 01:48:52,218
Anita is coming on 14th. - Okay.

1054
01:48:53,493 --> 01:48:55,518
Don't forget to send the car
to the station. - Okay, sir.

1055
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:57,253
Junior boss... Junior boss.

1056
01:49:02,335 --> 01:49:04,360
When did you see?
- Approximately one hour earlier.

1057
01:49:08,441 --> 01:49:11,205
Sister-in-law, when did
brother go out?

1058
01:49:11,845 --> 01:49:13,437
He went early morning.

1059
01:49:13,647 --> 01:49:15,342
He said that he's going the farm.

1060
01:49:15,582 --> 01:49:17,743
What's the matter? - Nothing.

1061
01:50:04,364 --> 01:50:05,262
Be ware!

1062
01:50:10,036 --> 01:50:13,403
Balli Thakur, come out quickly.

1063
01:50:15,542 --> 01:50:16,099
Look Shakti Thakur,

1064
01:50:16,309 --> 01:50:17,742
I don't know anything.
I'm just a Lawyer.

1065
01:50:17,944 --> 01:50:19,571
And I can prove that in the court.

1066
01:50:21,548 --> 01:50:22,708
What's all this, brother?

1067
01:50:25,452 --> 01:50:32,085
I didn't drink.
They forced me to drink.

1068
01:50:34,594 --> 01:50:35,618
What're you doing?

1069
01:50:36,796 --> 01:50:38,764
You're selling our father's dream
and not his property.

1070
01:50:38,999 --> 01:50:39,727
Property?

1071
01:50:40,734 --> 01:50:41,359
No.

1072
01:50:44,671 --> 01:50:47,139
These people told that
it's a letter.

1073
01:50:47,407 --> 01:50:49,466
No, I said nothing.

1074
01:50:50,644 --> 01:50:53,670
I'm ready to promise on Geetha.

1075
01:51:05,191 --> 01:51:06,123
Take my brother.

1076
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:14,129
Balli, look at me & recognize me.

1077
01:51:15,235 --> 01:51:17,135
I was also born in this land.

1078
01:51:18,238 --> 01:51:22,402
I've grown up by eating the
same food what you eat.

1079
01:51:23,910 --> 01:51:29,143
The animal which is active in you,
is lying dormant in me.

1080
01:51:30,050 --> 01:51:32,280
Don't ever try to activate it.

1081
01:51:33,386 --> 01:51:36,219
It's neither good for you
nor for me.

1082
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:48,526
Greetings madam.

1083
01:51:53,006 --> 01:51:53,995
Hasn't Shakti come?

1084
01:51:54,274 --> 01:51:55,263
No, he's at home.

1085
01:51:55,475 --> 01:51:56,339
Take the luggage.

1086
01:51:58,478 --> 01:52:00,844
Why didn't Shakti come?
- He had some work.

1087
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:23,430
What've you done to yourself.

1088
01:52:24,104 --> 01:52:26,572
For a second, I felt that your
father was standing in front of me.

1089
01:52:29,509 --> 01:52:34,173
I'm sorry, he was a great man.
- Thanks... Come.

1090
01:52:39,652 --> 01:52:43,088
Sister-in-law, don't cry.
Don't cry.

1091
01:52:46,893 --> 01:52:47,382
Come.

1092
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:52,789
Hi Surkhiya.

1093
01:52:52,999 --> 01:52:53,624
...You...

1094
01:52:55,335 --> 01:52:57,394
Boss... boss...

1095
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:00,338
You lost your hand
because of me, isn't it.

1096
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:04,642
This one... No one can change the fate.

1097
01:53:05,044 --> 01:53:06,341
But, you're alright, aren't you.

1098
01:53:06,713 --> 01:53:08,943
There's lot more power
in one hand.

1099
01:53:25,598 --> 01:53:28,158
Hi rangoli girl, how're you?

1100
01:53:28,701 --> 01:53:29,963
Did you get the photographs?

1101
01:53:31,738 --> 01:53:33,865
Did you get the photographs? - Yes.

1102
01:53:34,374 --> 01:53:35,170
What're you doing here?

1103
01:53:37,877 --> 01:53:38,844
Get something for us to drink.

1104
01:53:40,046 --> 01:53:42,514
Tea or Juice. - Tea.

1105
01:53:47,554 --> 01:53:49,351
She's from the opposite camp.

1106
01:53:49,889 --> 01:53:52,357
What's she doing here?
Anything new?

1107
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:16,040
I know why you're
upset with me.

1108
01:54:16,216 --> 01:54:18,047
You're angry because I didn't
come before, isn't it?

1109
01:54:18,718 --> 01:54:24,054
You sent the telegram that
your father expired after 4 days.

1110
01:54:25,225 --> 01:54:28,058
You didn't even write whether
I should come here or not.

1111
01:55:24,317 --> 01:55:29,050
Why did you do like that?

1112
01:55:41,467 --> 01:55:43,435
Why did you do that?

1113
01:55:45,104 --> 01:55:47,698
Tell me, where did I go wrong?

1114
01:55:57,016 --> 01:55:59,814
Situation. - Bullshit situation.

1115
01:56:08,027 --> 01:56:09,494
You too loved me, didn't you?

1116
01:56:10,863 --> 01:56:12,330
Or were you already in love with her?

1117
01:56:15,201 --> 01:56:16,668
Then, why did you do like this?

1118
01:56:17,537 --> 01:56:20,335
Loved me, but married her.
Tell me.

1119
01:56:23,543 --> 01:56:26,671
Whom do you love? Answer me.

1120
01:56:29,115 --> 01:56:29,706
I love this village.

1121
01:56:29,882 --> 01:56:34,979
So, you sacrificed my life for that
without asking me.

1122
01:56:35,755 --> 01:56:39,213
What right do you've to do that?
- Nothing.

1123
01:56:39,625 --> 01:56:48,226
Why the hell... - Abuse me.

1124
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:52,464
Curse, it's your the right.

1125
01:56:55,742 --> 01:56:57,039
This photo is true.

1126
01:56:59,912 --> 01:57:01,379
And I love you.

1127
01:57:02,315 --> 01:57:03,373
This also is true.

1128
01:57:05,918 --> 01:57:11,879
Out of these two, one
has to be a lie.

1129
01:57:21,367 --> 01:57:25,895
You've gone too far away from me
a short period.

1130
01:57:37,950 --> 01:57:44,082
I can never be pardoned for what
has happened to you.

1131
01:57:46,959 --> 01:57:51,089
So I won't even ask you
to forgive me.

1132
01:58:04,811 --> 01:58:06,278
By marrying Gehna,

1133
01:58:07,814 --> 01:58:12,945
I've not only made a bond with
Gehana, but also with this village.

1134
01:58:15,488 --> 01:58:17,718
It's my duty to take care of
both of them.

1135
01:58:21,494 --> 01:58:24,952
She married me without saying a word.

1136
01:58:27,166 --> 01:58:32,297
This one reason is enough for me not
to hurt her faith.

1137
01:58:36,175 --> 01:58:40,475
When I can't make you understand
what's in my heart,

1138
01:58:42,014 --> 01:58:45,074
I don't know whether I can
make her understand or not.

1139
01:58:51,023 --> 01:58:53,821
Whatever it's, this is the truth.

1140
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:58,658
Gehna is my wife &
will be my wife forever.

1141
01:59:00,032 --> 01:59:00,498
Who's that?

1142
01:59:01,701 --> 01:59:02,668
It's me...

1143
01:59:03,469 --> 01:59:03,992
Tea.

1144
01:59:38,070 --> 01:59:39,037
Your Gehna.

1145
01:59:42,241 --> 01:59:43,139
Your village.

1146
01:59:48,247 --> 01:59:49,145
Everything is yours.

1147
01:59:53,085 --> 01:59:54,052
Except me.

1148
02:00:01,594 --> 02:00:03,824
But this is also true that I love you.

1149
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:07,223
And it'll be always such.

1150
02:00:10,102 --> 02:00:11,569
I'm going. - Where?

1151
02:00:11,771 --> 02:00:14,001
Somewhere... to daddy's place.
- There's no train now.

1152
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:16,835
So what? I'll go by walk.
I'll die.

1153
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:20,668
I won't die.

1154
02:00:21,614 --> 02:00:24,242
I'll live & love you all my life.

1155
02:00:25,284 --> 02:00:27,081
This is your punishment.

1156
02:00:33,626 --> 02:00:37,255
Don't try to convince me.
I won't get convinced.

1157
02:01:01,821 --> 02:01:03,448
Right? - Right.

1158
02:01:04,156 --> 02:01:05,783
Right? - Right.

1159
02:01:06,592 --> 02:01:08,184
Right? - Right.

1160
02:01:08,828 --> 02:01:10,455
Right? - Right.

1161
02:01:11,497 --> 02:01:13,294
Right? - Wrong.

1162
02:01:20,339 --> 02:01:22,307
Can I get a ticket for
tomorrow's train?

1163
02:01:27,179 --> 02:01:30,148
Yes, I've already reserved a ticket.

1164
02:01:32,351 --> 02:01:35,320
I can... I can stay here
till then, can't I?

1165
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:41,552
Do you need to ask this?

1166
02:01:44,030 --> 02:01:45,327
I've become your guest, haven't I?

1167
02:02:10,222 --> 02:02:12,349
Hey, what're you doing?
Get up.

1168
02:02:13,726 --> 02:02:17,526
Please don't take away
my husband from me.

1169
02:02:20,399 --> 02:02:31,037
You both are equal in Education,
riches & all other things.

1170
02:02:32,745 --> 02:02:34,872
I've come as a hurdle
between you both.

1171
02:02:42,922 --> 02:02:45,447
Name? ...Gehna.

1172
02:02:46,359 --> 02:02:51,991
Gehna, I'm not here to
ruin your life.

1173
02:02:53,933 --> 02:02:55,730
I had come here in search of my life.

1174
02:02:58,437 --> 02:03:00,064
I've come to know that he
no more lives here.

1175
02:03:01,440 --> 02:03:02,907
That's why, I'm going back.

1176
02:03:05,277 --> 02:03:08,178
That there's a villager hidden
inside Shakti.

1177
02:03:10,282 --> 02:03:11,078
Don't worry.

1178
02:03:13,285 --> 02:03:16,254
The Shakti whom I loved
is not this man.

1179
02:03:17,957 --> 02:03:22,087
The man who lives here
is your husband.

1180
02:03:33,139 --> 02:03:35,039
Did you keep drinking water? - Yes.

1181
02:03:35,741 --> 02:03:39,370
They don't sleep at 8 like us,
they'll sleep late.

1182
02:03:40,312 --> 02:03:41,939
Give her company.

1183
02:03:42,982 --> 02:03:44,108
But, don't bore her with your talk.

1184
02:03:44,483 --> 02:03:46,041
If she's about sleep...
Come out. - Okay.

1185
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:05,296
Sit down.

1186
02:04:08,674 --> 02:04:10,232
Don't sit on the ground.
Sit on the chair.

1187
02:04:24,190 --> 02:04:27,819
It isn't his mistake,
it's a sacrifice. - What?

1188
02:04:29,528 --> 02:04:29,994
This...

1189
02:04:31,530 --> 02:04:35,660
if he hadn't married me, I & my
father would've committed suicide.

1190
02:04:36,035 --> 02:04:40,665
He married me to save
our lives & honour. Don't abuse him.

1191
02:04:41,207 --> 02:04:44,176
You make me the object of
your bitterness.

1192
02:04:50,216 --> 02:04:51,843
Shall I go? - Why?

1193
02:04:52,885 --> 02:04:56,013
I'll keep on blabbering.
I'm a villager, ain't I?

1194
02:04:57,223 --> 02:04:59,589
What if you get hurt
by some of my blabber.

1195
02:05:00,559 --> 02:05:04,689
Didn't Shakti tell you to talk to me,
till I go to sleep? Sit down.

1196
02:05:10,236 --> 02:05:12,363
If I keep on talking,
how'll you get sleep?

1197
02:05:14,240 --> 02:05:14,968
You're right.

1198
02:05:18,744 --> 02:05:20,871
Shall I sing a song?

1199
02:05:27,019 --> 02:05:31,217
Hey, don't cry.
I'll not sing.

1200
02:05:31,757 --> 02:05:34,317
By mistake I volunteered.
Please don't cry.

1201
02:05:34,527 --> 02:05:37,325
I'm not crying, I was laughing.
- Why?

1202
02:05:38,531 --> 02:05:39,054
Just like that.

1203
02:05:40,866 --> 02:05:42,060
On my fate.

1204
02:05:43,769 --> 02:05:45,566
Even then I'll not sing.
- Why?

1205
02:05:46,605 --> 02:05:49,836
No, you're laughing, if you start
crying after hearing my song?

1206
02:05:50,609 --> 02:05:51,906
I'm not a good singer.

1207
02:05:52,611 --> 02:05:54,078
I promise you, I'll not cry.

1208
02:05:54,947 --> 02:05:55,675
Then, shall I sing?

1209
02:05:56,181 --> 02:05:57,978
You can sing sitting also.

1210
02:05:58,183 --> 02:06:00,242
Yes, I can sit & sing.

1211
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:09,051
Anklets are tinkling.

1212
02:06:17,136 --> 02:06:21,505
Anklets are clinking.

1213
02:06:26,612 --> 02:06:32,949
How sweet is this union.

1214
02:07:01,080 --> 02:07:03,480
Bangles jungle.

1215
02:07:03,882 --> 02:07:06,476
Easterly winds are whizzing past.

1216
02:07:06,885 --> 02:07:12,517
The sky & earth is echoing
with its sound.

1217
02:07:30,976 --> 02:07:33,638
These fair arms.

1218
02:07:34,013 --> 02:07:36,447
I extend them stealthily.

1219
02:07:37,049 --> 02:07:39,574
He beckons me.

1220
02:07:39,785 --> 02:07:42,754
And says 'listen to me'.

1221
02:07:43,122 --> 02:07:45,590
Enveloped in fragrance.

1222
02:07:46,091 --> 02:07:48,491
I walk in a trance.

1223
02:07:49,028 --> 02:07:53,965
I always look very beautiful to him.

1224
02:07:55,067 --> 02:07:57,501
The pick buds and bring them to me.

1225
02:07:57,903 --> 02:08:00,599
Single string instrument
plays the tune.

1226
02:08:01,006 --> 02:08:06,876
I'm ecstatic hearing both.

1227
02:08:25,431 --> 02:08:27,899
Anita, come quickly. Train will stop
here only for 2 minutes.

1228
02:08:52,958 --> 02:08:56,018
This is a coupe.
You'll not have any company.

1229
02:08:57,129 --> 02:08:59,427
You're alone.
Yes, I'm alone.

1230
02:09:00,966 --> 02:09:02,092
It's your kindness.

1231
02:09:04,970 --> 02:09:11,773
Try to forget... me and our
- Love! Etc... etc.

1232
02:09:15,481 --> 02:09:16,448
Can't you forget me?

1233
02:09:19,985 --> 02:09:23,944
Nothing is impossible if
we make a sincere try.

1234
02:09:29,161 --> 02:09:31,391
I'll never think about
Gehna's Shakti.

1235
02:09:32,831 --> 02:09:36,790
But my Shakti lives here.
I can't forget him.

1236
02:09:37,770 --> 02:09:39,465
I can never forget him.

1237
02:10:22,381 --> 02:10:23,006
What happened?

1238
02:10:24,216 --> 02:10:25,342
'Lispic'(Lipstic).

1239
02:10:27,553 --> 02:10:28,281
'Lispic' (Lipstic).

1240
02:10:33,725 --> 02:10:36,023
No, other person should see it,

1241
02:10:36,995 --> 02:10:38,860
so I tried to wipe it
without your permission.

1242
02:10:41,567 --> 02:10:42,693
Don't get angry with me.

1243
02:10:49,241 --> 02:10:52,540
I can understand. How can
these villagers understand?

1244
02:10:53,412 --> 02:10:54,709
If anyone passes adverse comments.

1245
02:10:55,414 --> 02:10:57,541
Unnecessarily your fair name
will get tarnished.

1246
02:10:58,350 --> 02:10:59,214
That's why...

1247
02:11:03,255 --> 02:11:04,313
Please, drive slowly.

1248
02:11:07,492 --> 02:11:12,054
You appear tensed and 'sade'.
- What?

1249
02:11:12,598 --> 02:11:14,896
'Tension' & 'Sade'.

1250
02:11:17,102 --> 02:11:19,400
Sister-in-law has advised
me to learn English.

1251
02:11:20,439 --> 02:11:22,236
To win your heart.

1252
02:11:23,542 --> 02:11:25,339
Now a days she's my teacher.

1253
02:11:53,805 --> 02:11:54,271
What?

1254
02:11:58,644 --> 02:12:02,978
I mean... forgive me.

1255
02:12:04,549 --> 02:12:08,246
What're you saying?
You are my God.

1256
02:12:09,888 --> 02:12:13,255
I'm the one who should say sorry.
It was all because of me.

1257
02:12:14,026 --> 02:12:15,960
Everything had happened
because of me.

1258
02:13:05,110 --> 02:13:06,839
Didn't I say it isn't any
attempt on my life?

1259
02:13:07,045 --> 02:13:07,909
It was just an accident.

1260
02:13:08,246 --> 02:13:09,907
You might've noticed
the lorry's number.

1261
02:13:10,716 --> 02:13:11,182
No.

1262
02:13:12,250 --> 02:13:15,048
I was more worried that
Gehna shouldn't get hurt.

1263
02:13:15,887 --> 02:13:17,912
Please, you don't suspect anyone
without any valid reason.

1264
02:13:18,223 --> 02:13:18,848
Forget it.

1265
02:13:23,061 --> 02:13:23,686
What happened?

1266
02:13:24,396 --> 02:13:26,227
Nothing dear, tumbler fell down.

1267
02:13:33,105 --> 02:13:38,202
Jr. Thakur, after that accident
if there's little sound,

1268
02:13:38,710 --> 02:13:41,873
Poor girl gets scared.
You might've got hurt.

1269
02:13:43,115 --> 02:13:46,175
Jr. Thakur, it's my humble request.

1270
02:13:46,918 --> 02:13:48,545
Wherever you might go,
please don't go alone.

1271
02:13:48,920 --> 02:13:49,887
Yes. - Yes... Yes...

1272
02:13:51,456 --> 02:13:54,289
Bye. - Bye, Jr. Boss.

1273
02:13:56,928 --> 02:14:03,265
Moon... moon... Distant...
- Aunty, she's beating me.

1274
02:14:04,136 --> 02:14:06,696
If you fight among yourselves,
I'll not tell you story tonight.

1275
02:14:07,339 --> 02:14:09,830
Go & play without any fights.

1276
02:14:13,545 --> 02:14:14,307
Coming, sister-in-law.

1277
02:14:16,014 --> 02:14:17,538
You sit here only.
Don't go away.

1278
02:14:18,383 --> 02:14:22,012
They're asking for the pickle,
please, take it out.

1279
02:14:36,301 --> 02:14:39,600
Slowly... slowly...
Why're you rushing in like that?

1280
02:14:40,672 --> 02:14:42,299
You might fracture your limbs
if you fall down.

1281
02:14:43,041 --> 02:14:47,535
You called me by name for the first time.
I couldn't control myself.

1282
02:14:50,148 --> 02:14:50,944
What do you want?

1283
02:15:10,368 --> 02:15:11,232
Close the door.

1284
02:15:28,854 --> 02:15:29,320
Look...

1285
02:15:33,758 --> 02:15:35,885
You're my wife.
I'm your husband.

1286
02:15:39,164 --> 02:15:41,189
No body can change our
relationship. Got it?

1287
02:15:44,736 --> 02:15:45,361
What?

1288
02:15:46,138 --> 02:15:47,230
Nobody can change it.

1289
02:15:51,710 --> 02:15:54,543
But, I need some time
to change myself.

1290
02:15:56,448 --> 02:15:59,713
In due course,
I'll forget all my past.

1291
02:16:00,952 --> 02:16:02,249
You're not angry with me, are you?

1292
02:16:03,755 --> 02:16:04,221
No.

1293
02:16:05,190 --> 02:16:06,714
You're able to understand my
problem, aren't you?

1294
02:16:08,760 --> 02:16:09,226
Yes.

1295
02:16:12,097 --> 02:16:14,565
Men... No mention sir.

1296
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:22,906
Shall I go?

1297
02:16:24,709 --> 02:16:25,175
Why?

1298
02:16:26,444 --> 02:16:28,378
I'll be a disturbance to you.

1299
02:16:31,449 --> 02:16:31,915
What?

1300
02:16:32,918 --> 02:16:35,250
I don't have any problem,
please sit here.

1301
02:16:36,988 --> 02:16:38,819
Not there... here.

1302
02:16:45,463 --> 02:16:46,088
Get up.

1303
02:16:48,133 --> 02:16:48,656
Sit down.

1304
02:16:50,068 --> 02:16:50,534
Get up.

1305
02:16:51,636 --> 02:16:52,102
Sit down.

1306
02:16:54,506 --> 02:16:56,701
Why do you behave like a puppet?

1307
02:16:57,776 --> 02:17:00,711
This is your home.
Live as you wish.

1308
02:17:01,780 --> 02:17:03,805
No one will stop you.

1309
02:17:05,150 --> 02:17:07,675
If you need anything
feel free to ask me.

1310
02:17:08,353 --> 02:17:10,753
If you don't like anything
feel free to tell me.

1311
02:17:11,456 --> 02:17:15,552
You too feel free to tell me
if you don't like anything.

1312
02:17:16,661 --> 02:17:17,127
Okay.

1313
02:17:19,364 --> 02:17:20,797
Did you like the song?

1314
02:17:20,999 --> 02:17:21,465
Why?

1315
02:17:22,334 --> 02:17:27,328
Anita was sad, so when I volunteered
to sing for her.

1316
02:17:27,572 --> 02:17:28,470
She broke into laughter.

1317
02:17:28,673 --> 02:17:31,141
If you're sad, shall I
sing for you too?

1318
02:17:31,676 --> 02:17:33,803
Yes, go ahead. - Yes.

1319
02:17:34,512 --> 02:17:35,479
You can sing sitting also.

1320
02:17:36,181 --> 02:17:38,376
Yes, I can sing sitting also.

1321
02:17:42,854 --> 02:17:46,813
Anklets are tinkling.

1322
02:17:50,362 --> 02:17:54,992
Anklets are clinking

1323
02:17:55,800 --> 02:18:00,669
How sweet is our...

1324
02:18:02,540 --> 02:18:03,768
Anklets...

1325
02:18:09,914 --> 02:18:11,404
Only air is coming out.

1326
02:18:21,593 --> 02:18:27,190
Not because of this.
My voice isn't coming out.

1327
02:18:39,244 --> 02:18:41,906
Anklets are tinkling.

1328
02:18:42,180 --> 02:18:44,705
Anklets are clinking.

1329
02:18:45,150 --> 02:18:50,713
How sweet is our relationship.

1330
02:18:52,991 --> 02:18:55,221
My bangles are making sound.

1331
02:18:55,694 --> 02:18:58,322
Easterly wind is whizzing past.

1332
02:18:58,730 --> 02:19:04,066
The sky & Earth are echoing
with the sound.

1333
02:20:13,304 --> 02:20:16,034
Sometimes you walk fast.

1334
02:20:16,674 --> 02:20:24,547
Sometimes you walk slow. My heart is
troubling in love.

1335
02:20:24,749 --> 02:20:28,310
The river will flow.

1336
02:20:28,720 --> 02:20:31,211
Wind will make whizzing sound.

1337
02:20:31,756 --> 02:20:37,092
We are talking to each
other wasting time.

1338
02:20:37,762 --> 02:20:40,128
The maiden is singing melodiously.

1339
02:20:40,698 --> 02:20:43,223
Beloved is dancing to her tunes.

1340
02:20:43,768 --> 02:20:49,001
This heart is lost in love.

1341
02:21:46,798 --> 02:21:49,392
This girl is fair complexioned.

1342
02:21:49,834 --> 02:21:52,268
I'm not holding it stealthily.

1343
02:21:52,770 --> 02:21:57,730
Listen to me.
Please listen to me.

1344
02:21:57,942 --> 02:22:04,347
You're mesmerized.
You're walking in a trance.

1345
02:22:04,782 --> 02:22:10,084
You appear new to me every time.

1346
02:22:10,288 --> 02:22:13,348
Shall I bring buds selectively?

1347
02:22:13,892 --> 02:22:16,417
As the one stringed instrument
'EK Tara' plays.

1348
02:22:16,961 --> 02:22:22,263
Let's get enchanted
with that music.

1349
02:22:52,397 --> 02:22:58,336
Villagers believe that Goddess procession
hasn't been taken out for few years.

1350
02:22:58,803 --> 02:23:01,795
That's why, few untoward
incidents took place.

1351
02:23:03,107 --> 02:23:05,200
This year the Panchayat
has decided...

1352
02:23:05,843 --> 02:23:07,970
Under the supervision of
Endowment officer...

1353
02:23:08,179 --> 02:23:10,170
Procession of Goddess Devi
will be taken out.

1354
02:23:10,782 --> 02:23:15,583
And the honour of Chief Guest will
go to Raja Thakur's family.

1355
02:23:19,791 --> 02:23:21,190
Why Raja Thakur's family?

1356
02:23:21,759 --> 02:23:22,851
Because, he's elder.

1357
02:23:23,294 --> 02:23:23,885
On what basis.

1358
02:23:24,796 --> 02:23:27,094
On the basis of who are alive.
Or on the basis of dead people.

1359
02:23:27,832 --> 02:23:29,663
Amongst living persons
he's not the elder.

1360
02:23:30,535 --> 02:23:32,560
And the statues of the dead
has to be determined in heaven.

1361
02:23:32,804 --> 02:23:33,828
Why're you using that
yardstick here?

1362
02:23:34,706 --> 02:23:39,507
Is it to enable him to feel
victorious in front of the villagers.

1363
02:23:39,711 --> 02:23:40,678
And make us the losers.

1364
02:23:41,012 --> 02:23:43,071
Balli, don't excited &
talk irrelevantly.

1365
02:23:44,115 --> 02:23:46,208
The festival is being arranged
for the well being of the entire village.

1366
02:23:46,517 --> 02:23:48,144
What relevance, victory
and defeat has in this.

1367
02:23:49,587 --> 02:23:52,283
My real victory will on the day when this
divided village unites.

1368
02:23:53,124 --> 02:23:54,716
I'm not interested in becoming
the Chief Guest.

1369
02:23:55,259 --> 02:23:57,318
You be the chief guest.
I accept you're elder to me.

1370
02:23:57,929 --> 02:24:01,524
Balli's days are not so bad to
pick up crumbs thrown by you.

1371
02:24:03,534 --> 02:24:05,502
You can't win over
Balli so easily.

1372
02:24:06,638 --> 02:24:09,232
In near future, I'll behead you.

1373
02:24:10,408 --> 02:24:11,466
Or else I'm not a Thakur.

1374
02:24:12,076 --> 02:24:13,270
Hey, stop blabbering.

1375
02:24:19,283 --> 02:24:23,049
Which is more important
to be a Thakur or human?

1376
02:24:23,788 --> 02:24:27,224
In near future neither you'll be
a Thakur nor a human,

1377
02:24:28,760 --> 02:24:31,388
Just a dead body... dead body.

1378
02:24:33,097 --> 02:24:34,029
This is my challenge.

1379
02:24:35,900 --> 02:24:37,265
I'm also challenging you.

1380
02:24:39,103 --> 02:24:41,298
Never trouble the villagers.

1381
02:24:44,108 --> 02:24:45,598
Has the beast inside you waken up?

1382
02:24:47,111 --> 02:24:47,634
No...

1383
02:24:49,347 --> 02:24:50,575
And never try to wake it up.

1384
02:24:51,849 --> 02:24:54,647
Before that happens your head will
roll on the earth.

1385
02:24:55,787 --> 02:24:58,255
Come. - Let's go.

1386
02:24:58,623 --> 02:25:01,592
Balli Thakur, wait. Next year
you'll get the chance.

1387
02:25:03,594 --> 02:25:05,687
365 days are still there
for next year.

1388
02:25:06,164 --> 02:25:08,428
Don't know what'll happen
in between. Come on boys.

1389
02:25:24,282 --> 02:25:26,910
Enough of your make up.
Come out quickly.

1390
02:25:27,251 --> 02:25:29,344
People will come to see the
Goddess not you.

1391
02:25:29,854 --> 02:25:34,951
Moving the Goddess chariot is easier
than moving women away from mirror.

1392
02:25:35,193 --> 02:25:36,455
Has Surkhia come.
- He might've... he'll be outside.

1393
02:25:37,962 --> 02:25:41,022
Mother said she'll come just now.
Aunty's health isn't good.

1394
02:25:41,332 --> 02:25:42,629
She's vomiting number of times.

1395
02:25:43,334 --> 02:25:45,632
Didn't mother say not
to tell them.

1396
02:25:46,771 --> 02:25:47,795
Gehna's health is not good?

1397
02:25:48,172 --> 02:25:49,799
Nothing wrong, she's fine.

1398
02:25:50,007 --> 02:25:50,871
She might've eaten something.

1399
02:25:51,075 --> 02:25:52,201
A days' fast will set
right everything.

1400
02:25:52,443 --> 02:25:55,640
Oh! No! Got it?

1401
02:25:56,481 --> 02:25:59,416
Come... come... come.
- But, why is she vomiting?

1402
02:26:00,118 --> 02:26:03,417
You've absolutely dumb.
Inspite of being father of 3 children yet.

1403
02:28:07,345 --> 02:28:10,940
Is it Inspector speaking?

1404
02:28:11,182 --> 02:28:12,114
No, he has gone out.

1405
02:28:12,383 --> 02:28:16,615
What? Gone out? - Oh God!

1406
02:28:17,154 --> 02:28:19,452
I want to tell him about
an important matter.

1407
02:28:19,657 --> 02:28:20,646
But, who are you?

1408
02:28:21,859 --> 02:28:24,225
I'm Birju Thakur speaking.

1409
02:28:29,400 --> 02:28:30,867
What's so important to
talk with the Inspector?

1410
02:28:31,235 --> 02:28:36,696
Don't do it. It'll lead
to destruction.

1411
02:28:37,508 --> 02:28:39,237
Yes Balli, listen to him.

1412
02:28:39,510 --> 02:28:40,602
Listen to him.

1413
02:28:41,612 --> 02:28:45,810
Stop, Balli. Stop... stop.

1414
02:28:46,417 --> 02:28:47,509
It'll be a disaster.

1415
02:29:15,880 --> 02:29:17,848
Who're you to stop me
from pulling the rope?

1416
02:29:18,049 --> 02:29:19,175
Do you know who I'm?
What's going on?

1417
02:29:19,383 --> 02:29:22,216
Move away & let me go.
- What's going on here?

1418
02:29:22,420 --> 02:29:26,117
Call the son of Raja Thakur,
the junior boss. I want to talk to him.

1419
02:29:26,390 --> 02:29:30,759
What's the matter? Why're you upset?
- I don't want to talk to you.

1420
02:29:30,962 --> 02:29:33,294
Call the junior boss.
- What did you say?

1421
02:29:33,497 --> 02:29:36,022
Call the junior boss.
Why're you shouting?

1422
02:29:36,567 --> 02:29:39,798
I'm Raja Thakur's son.
Tell me, what's the matter?

1423
02:29:41,105 --> 02:29:42,868
You... Shakti.

1424
02:29:43,307 --> 02:29:46,902
My dear, you've grown up so big.
I couldn't recognise you.

1425
02:29:47,111 --> 02:29:53,914
How could you recognise me?
I'm Satho Aunty.

1426
02:29:54,285 --> 02:29:56,378
I fed you on my lap.
- Oh, are you Satho Aunty!?

1427
02:29:56,587 --> 02:29:59,886
Balli's baby sitter,
I used to feed you.

1428
02:30:01,325 --> 02:30:02,656
Yes, but what's the problem?

1429
02:30:02,893 --> 02:30:06,329
Look my dear, I've come from a long
distance to pull the rope.

1430
02:30:06,530 --> 02:30:10,091
They're not allowing me to go.
- It's such a simple issue.

1431
02:30:10,334 --> 02:30:12,734
Yes. Okay, come with me.
- Hey, move.

1432
02:30:19,877 --> 02:30:24,576
Come... come.
Stand here... stand here.

1433
02:30:26,384 --> 02:30:27,578
No one will bother me, isn't it?

1434
02:30:27,785 --> 02:30:29,912
No one will question you.

1435
02:30:30,121 --> 02:30:31,554
If someone hits me & pushes me down.

1436
02:30:31,856 --> 02:30:33,346
No one will push you.
This is my place.

1437
02:30:33,557 --> 02:30:34,023
What?

1438
02:30:34,258 --> 02:30:37,921
This is my place. No one will push you.
- You gave me your place. I'll go now.

1439
02:30:38,129 --> 02:30:39,596
May Goddess bless with a long life.

1440
02:30:39,797 --> 02:30:41,424
Stand here confidently.
No one will ever question you.

1441
02:30:41,632 --> 02:30:44,328
Surkhiya, what're you doing here, come.
- I'm coming. - Come... come.

1442
02:30:44,535 --> 02:30:46,935
I'm satisfied the moment
I hold this rope.

1443
02:30:47,872 --> 02:30:52,241
All my sins are washed. I've attained
salvation. Hail the Goddess!

1444
02:33:11,448 --> 02:33:14,576
Nanny... Nanny!

1445
02:33:47,017 --> 02:33:47,779
Where's Balli?

1446
02:33:49,186 --> 02:33:51,279
Balli is not here, Shakti.

1447
02:33:51,789 --> 02:33:56,283
He has ran away leaving
us all to die.

1448
02:33:56,961 --> 02:34:00,692
Now you do anything you
want to do with us.

1449
02:34:01,065 --> 02:34:05,627
Kill us all. Behead us... Behead us.
- Yes son.

1450
02:34:06,370 --> 02:34:12,798
Anyway the villagers won't leave us alive.
It better to die at your hands.

1451
02:34:15,779 --> 02:34:17,474
Kill her... - Mother...

1452
02:34:20,351 --> 02:34:22,148
Kill her.

1453
02:34:33,197 --> 02:34:36,860
Kill them... Kill them.
Don't spare anyone.

1454
02:34:37,368 --> 02:34:40,394
Find each one & kill them.
Open the door.

1455
02:34:40,771 --> 02:34:41,829
They've locked the door & staying
inside. Open the door.

1456
02:34:55,552 --> 02:34:56,780
Send the traitors out.

1457
02:34:56,987 --> 02:34:59,751
Let them be your relatives, never mind.
We'll burn them alive.

1458
02:34:59,957 --> 02:35:03,017
Blood for blood. For how long
will this continue?

1459
02:35:04,128 --> 02:35:05,026
How long?

1460
02:35:07,097 --> 02:35:08,928
Go away from here. Go.

1461
02:35:14,738 --> 02:35:17,172
If you still want to
take revenge,

1462
02:35:17,574 --> 02:35:21,874
I'm here infront of you.
Remove me from your path.

1463
02:35:23,213 --> 02:35:26,546
And turn Raja Thakur's Palace
into a cauldron of death.

1464
02:35:43,901 --> 02:35:46,267
Attention all villagers.

1465
02:35:46,804 --> 02:35:48,965
Because of the bomb blast during
chariot procession...

1466
02:35:52,109 --> 02:35:56,910
On Collector's orders
Section 144 has been clamped.

1467
02:35:57,614 --> 02:35:59,275
If in any public place in the village,

1468
02:35:59,783 --> 02:36:02,149
Balli Thakur or Shakti Thakur's men

1469
02:36:02,386 --> 02:36:04,911
or assembly of others groups
is prohibited.

1470
02:36:05,322 --> 02:36:09,019
Violators of this order
will be arrested.

1471
02:37:09,920 --> 02:37:10,887
Why did you come here?

1472
02:37:11,088 --> 02:37:12,817
Police is searching for you
in every nook & corner.

1473
02:37:13,023 --> 02:37:14,650
You go away from here.
You go away.

1474
02:37:15,192 --> 02:37:17,990
I'm not a coward like your husband
to hide in a burrow.

1475
02:37:19,263 --> 02:37:23,700
Shit eater pigs of the enemy.

1476
02:37:24,134 --> 02:37:25,567
I'm here to cut that dogs head.

1477
02:37:25,769 --> 02:37:28,363
And your's & your husbands too.
- I'll not let it happen, Balli.

1478
02:37:29,072 --> 02:37:31,905
You can't take any more lives.
So you've come.

1479
02:37:32,743 --> 02:37:34,370
Today not even your angels
can save you from me.

1480
02:37:35,312 --> 02:37:36,574
I do what I say.

1481
02:37:36,780 --> 02:37:37,246
Take it.

1482
02:37:42,119 --> 02:37:42,744
Pick it up.

1483
02:37:43,987 --> 02:37:47,252
What're you looking at?
Either of us should live after today.

1484
02:37:48,025 --> 02:37:49,686
There has already been too much of
bloodshed, Balli.

1485
02:37:50,627 --> 02:37:51,992
Why're you thirsting for
more blood?

1486
02:37:52,329 --> 02:37:55,992
If I commit one murder or 100 murders.
I'll be hanged only once.

1487
02:37:57,534 --> 02:38:01,436
To behead you, I'm waiting here
without food & water.

1488
02:38:01,638 --> 02:38:02,263
Pick it up.

1489
02:38:02,473 --> 02:38:04,441
Why've you become
a blood thirsty beast?

1490
02:38:04,641 --> 02:38:07,804
If I allow my wife to spend
a night under your roof,

1491
02:38:08,245 --> 02:38:10,941
Then spit on my manhood.
- Balli, be ashamed of yourself.

1492
02:38:11,348 --> 02:38:14,613
You're my elder brother.
Your wife is my sister-in-law.

1493
02:38:15,052 --> 02:38:16,451
Pick up the weapon, you eunuch!

1494
02:38:17,488 --> 02:38:20,719
God who has saved our lives,
are you going to take his life?

1495
02:38:21,191 --> 02:38:23,284
No. Don't do like that. - Move away.

1496
02:38:23,660 --> 02:38:24,126
Aunty...

1497
02:38:29,733 --> 02:38:33,794
Aunty, Balli look!
- Balli, don't do like that.

1498
02:38:35,138 --> 02:38:38,005
Aunty, stay away. Stay away aunty.
- Bloody Thakur.

1499
02:38:38,208 --> 02:38:39,470
Has the beast inside you died?

1500
02:38:40,577 --> 02:38:41,475
You eunuch!

1501
02:38:42,446 --> 02:38:44,676
Have you seen a messenger of death?
Look at me.

1502
02:38:44,982 --> 02:38:47,450
I'm the messenger of death.
- No.

1503
02:39:14,211 --> 02:39:16,179
No Balli, listen to you mother.

1504
02:39:16,380 --> 02:39:17,244
Don't go mad with rage.

1505
02:39:57,888 --> 02:40:01,722
Kill him. It's better that I don't have
such a son.

1506
02:40:08,865 --> 02:40:15,395
Balli, come to the police station.
Police is searching for you.

1507
02:40:16,340 --> 02:40:18,137
Even the villagers are also
thirsting for your blood.

1508
02:40:20,243 --> 02:40:20,902
Come, aunty.

1509
02:40:50,173 --> 02:40:51,140
Balli stop.

1510
02:41:24,241 --> 02:41:25,071
Balli... stop Balli.

1511
02:42:24,801 --> 02:42:26,359
Now, wake up the beast inside you.

1512
02:42:27,504 --> 02:42:33,340
Why don't you wake it up.
Wake it up. Wake it up.

1513
02:43:02,139 --> 02:43:04,164
You've made me also a killer.

1514
02:43:05,142 --> 02:43:06,871
You've made me also a killer.

1515
02:43:08,044 --> 02:43:10,774
I was telling you not to wake
the beast inside me.

1516

yourself to the police.

from my conscience?
