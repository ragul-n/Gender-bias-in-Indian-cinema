1
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:23,037
Excuse me..

2
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,079
Please hold the lift!

3
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,148
Oh no! What's wrong?

4
00:02:18,033 --> 00:02:19,137
Hello?

5
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:22,875
Hello boss? Is anyone there?

6
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,238
What's happening?

7
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:49,411
Hello!

8
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,044
Is anyone there?

9
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:52,903
Please answer the phone!

10
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,910
Again?

11
00:04:05,267 --> 00:04:06,268
A ghost or a witch?

12
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:09,102
What difference does it make?

13
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:11,378
It's all because of you.

14
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:15,038
As if I asked the ghost
to scare you in your dreams!

15
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:17,811
Coward!

16
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,208
Kunal!

17
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,142
Give me back the remote!

18
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,178
Remote.

19
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,271
Here you go!

20
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,046
Let go of me!
Let go of me, otherwise.

21
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,205
Otherwise what?

22
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:31,003
Shut up.

23
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:33,337
What? You'll divorce me?

24
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,004
You'll divorce me?

25
00:04:37,767 --> 00:04:39,838
No. I'll kiss Dhruv.

26
00:04:40,167 --> 00:04:41,407
Dhruv? Who is Dhruv?

27
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,339
The hero of my story.

28
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,144
A sexy ghost who sucks blood.

29
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,311
Mosquitds suck blood too.

30
00:04:48,433 --> 00:04:50,174
Shut up. Go back to sleep.

31
00:04:50,433 --> 00:04:51,969
I've a lot of work to do.

32
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:54,107
I'm sick of this.

33
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:56,935
This atmosphere that
you have created.

34
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,306
Your weird lifestyle.

35
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,744
You don't socialise.

36
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,775
Non-stop horror movies..

37
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,839
Everything here from my
wife to the television, is horror.

38
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,244
It's called ambience.

39
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,244
What?

40
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:11,868
How many times do I have to tell you?!

41
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,207
Why don't you try something else?

42
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:16,073
Romance? Comedy? Why horror?

43
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:20,746
Because I find ghosts damn cute.

44
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:22,869
There is no such thing as ghosts.

45
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:24,671
All you are doing is selling lies.

46
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,903
When I was in the 12th grade.

47
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,011
I had a friend at the hostel, Anita.

48
00:05:39,033 --> 00:05:40,808
Her life was full of problems.

49
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:43,747
At home,
with her boyfriend, in studies.

50
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,172
When she came back to
the hostel after vacations.

51
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:48,244
She started behaving strangely.

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,206
Strange? How?

53
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,842
Like talking strangely,
getting emotional.

54
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,307
Laugh one minute then cry the next.

55
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,679
I knew something was very weird.

56
00:06:00,633 --> 00:06:03,011
The next day we had our math exams.

57
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,874
We studied through the night,
on the terrace.

58
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,305
In the morning,
a friend of mine called me..

59
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,173
Do you know what she said?

60
00:06:10,367 --> 00:06:12,244
Anita had committed suicide.

61
00:06:14,867 --> 00:06:16,676
I couldn't sleep a wink that night.

62
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:19,943
I kept staring at the ceiling fan.

63
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:23,710
The ceiling fan.

64
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:27,212
She hung herself from it.

65
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:31,347
Have you ever seen a body
of someone who has committed suicide?

66
00:06:34,167 --> 00:06:37,307
Bulging eyes,
protruding tongue and a broken neck..

67
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:38,744
Like this!

68
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,244
I still remember that night.

69
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:45,972
Saturday. 13th June.

70
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,113
Those were my last
few days at the hostel.

71
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,709
I was asleep one night and
then all of a sudden, I woke up.

72
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,901
You know what I saw?

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,910
What?

74
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:59,207
Anita. As a ghost.

75
00:07:00,867 --> 00:07:02,244
She was sitting by my foot.

76
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:04,071
Staring at me.

77
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:05,768
Then?

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,708
Then? She sat there for a while.

79
00:07:08,967 --> 00:07:10,275
And then she left.

80
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,603
After that,
she comes visits me even] Saturday.

81
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:19,937
Anita!

82
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,046
You should an actor.

83
00:07:26,233 --> 00:07:28,042
That's what my publisher says too.

84
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:30,303
Today is my final reading.

85
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,073
All this ghost stuff
is just nonsensical.

86
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:38,170
Otherwise,
why have I never seen a ghost?

87
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,875
Kunal..

88
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:43,310
Even] fear has its moment.

89
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:47,009
And your moment is waiting.

90
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,105
Kunal!

91
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,774
Your moment is waiting.

92
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,110
"All we are saying is.."

93
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:12,703
"Give pizza a chance."

94
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,972
"Give me pizza!"

95
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,049
"Don't get scared!
Pizza boy coming."

96
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:26,809
"Give it up!"
"To the pizza boy!"

97
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,471
"Check it out!"
"He's the pizza boy!"

98
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:32,036
"We'll cut the pizza,
we'll all share."

99
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,842
"You'll get some too.
No one will be spared."

100
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:37,607
"We'll cut the pizza,
we'll all share."

101
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,146
"You'll get some too.
No one will be spared."

102
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:42,713
"if no one gives you company
then who will be your company?"

103
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,747
"Have a slice and all
your problems will be solved."

104
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,542
"888844-triple zero."

105
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,076
"Pizza boy, you are my hero!"

106
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:55,845
"In the times of trouble,
we must be strong."

107
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:57,205
"Give me pizza."

108
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,475
"What the world needs now is Pizza."

109
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,809
"Joint, chillum, dope.. Have a drag."

110
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,575
“Don't think, if you're
hungry then call the pizza boy.“

111
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,170
"Butter chicken,
pepperoni, veggie, margarita."

112
00:09:10,433 --> 00:09:12,003
"Give me.. give me.. give me.."

113
00:09:12,467 --> 00:09:13,445
"Give me pizza."

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,046
"We'll cut the pizza,
we'll all share."

115
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,842
"You'll get some too.
No one will be spared."

116
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,607
"We'll cut the pizza,
we'll all share."

117
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,474
"You'll get some too.
No one will be spared."

118
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:30,603
Pizza is your right.

119
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,011
Lobo!

120
00:10:07,933 --> 00:10:08,934
Lobo!

121
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:15,575
Who are you?

122
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:16,577
Quite.

123
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:27,968
What's happening?

124
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,572
A requiescat.

125
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:58,645
Who is this bearded guy?

126
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,771
I don't know.

127
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,037
I thought he was a beggar
so I told him to get lost.

128
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,102
Then the boss came in.

129
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,970
But I don't understand.
What's going on?

130
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,676
You don't need to know everything.

131
00:11:10,633 --> 00:11:13,876
Boss has his fingers in many pies.

132
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,979
Who knows what toppings
he's offered to which Gods!

133
00:11:18,933 --> 00:11:19,934
What do you think?

134
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,903
He's got all this from selling pizzas?

135
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:24,445
Only he knows what goes
on in that cabin of his.

136
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:26,003
What's going on?

137
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:27,503
Yes?

138
00:11:28,533 --> 00:11:29,910
Get back to work!

139
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:31,868
And you!

140
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,979
How dare you call guru-ji a thief?

141
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,477
A beggar, sir.

142
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:37,607
I'll deal with you later.

143
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:39,744
Go make sure he's alright.

144
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,670
Stop staring and gawking.
Get back to work.

145
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,378
Sir..

146
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:50,902
What would you like?

147
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,870
You took my boss's,
might as well take mine too..

148
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,737
E r. . service.

149
00:11:58,967 --> 00:11:59,968
Tea?

150
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,670
Idli (savoun/ cake)?

151
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:02,968
Bananas?

152
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:04,503
Pudding?

153
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:05,968
Or rice and lentils?

154
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,443
One medium veg pizza,
with jalapefios and extra olives.

155
00:12:15,967 --> 00:12:17,344
Hey, waiten.

156
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:19,939
Thin crust.

157
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,872
Nikki!

158
00:12:52,667 --> 00:12:53,702
Hey, Nikki!

159
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,537
Nikki! Come out, Nikita!

160
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,777
Come out, Nikki!

161
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,472
Nikki, why is my t-shirt wet?

162
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:07,241
Why are you crying?

163
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:09,402
Hey!

164
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:11,968
Nikki!

165
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,776
This is just great!
I can't even say anything to you.

166
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,568
Nikki..

167
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,608
The t-shirt I wore yesterday is wet.

168
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:23,905
And today's stinks of sweat.

169
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,472
What will I wear to work?

170
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,407
You are at home the whole day.

171
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,773
Can't you do one small thing for me?

172
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,243
Don't give me an excuse
of being a writer. You understand?

173
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:42,371
Listen to me. Please..

174
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:45,469
Look, I'm worried too.

175
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,406
We are living off your
parents' insurance money.

176
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:51,937
We aren't living,
just barely sun/iving.

177
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,281
You know I want to
make something of myself.

178
00:13:57,567 --> 00:14:00,480
And for that you'll have
to be a little more responsible.

179
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,836
Look, I am not saying
that I am perfect.

180
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,643
But at least I am careful.

181
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:15,710
I am pregnant.

182
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,438
What do we do now?

183
00:14:36,733 --> 00:14:38,610
What's done is done.

184
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:42,680
I don't mean it that way.
Did you go to the doctor?

185
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,302
What will you do?

186
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:46,575
I'll go today.

187
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,504
What Will I do?

188
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,437
Why is that even a question?

189
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,303
Come on,
try to understand the situation.

190
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:56,479
You are a struggling writer.
I am a pizza delivery boy.

191
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:57,671
We both are just scraping through.

192
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,540
Yes, but that's not permanent.

193
00:14:59,667 --> 00:15:02,648
No. After 2-3 years..
I'll get a promotion.

194
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,839
I'll be a manager,
my salary will triple.

195
00:15:05,233 --> 00:15:07,611
That will be the right
time to have a child.

196
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,546
Fine! I'll tell the baby
to stay in me for three years.

197
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:14,273
Nikki..

198
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:18,070
Nikki, you don't need to
get emotional over everything.

199
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,311
Can't you be practical?

200
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:20,810
I'm having a baby.

201
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,373
I have a right to be emotional.

202
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:27,308
You don't want this baby,
that's fine.

203
00:15:28,367 --> 00:15:29,345
I want it.

204
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,443
With or without you.

205
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,438
And you know what?

206
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,637
I just hope our baby
doesn't turn out like you.

207
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,779
Nikki! - Shut up!

208
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,069
"Some things unsaid.."

209
00:15:57,133 --> 00:16:02,207
“Some things important.“

210
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:08,278
"Lingered on the lips, through
eyes there were to be expressed."

211
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:13,043
"Some things unsaid.."

212
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,046
“Some things important.“

213
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:19,014
"Lingered on the lips, through
eyes there were to be expressed."

214
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:23,673
“Leaving everything incomplete. .“

215
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,014
"You just left me alone."

216
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:31,774
"You just left me alone."

217
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:35,774
"You just left me alone."

218
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,173
"You just left me alone."

219
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:19,016
“Unnecessary tiffs,
meaningless arguments. .“

220
00:17:20,967 --> 00:17:28,385
“Unnecessary tiffs,
meaningless arguments. .“

221
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:33,006
“Unnecessary tiffs,
meaningless arguments. .“

222
00:17:33,067 --> 00:17:37,538
"With whom will I have?"

223
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:41,640
"You just left me alone."

224
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:45,640
"You just left me alone."

225
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:50,013
"You just left me alone."

226
00:17:50,167 --> 00:17:53,376
"You just left me alone."

227
00:18:31,067 --> 00:18:33,343
'This is the last time
I am ironing your clothes.'

228
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:36,641
'l am not your maid
to do all these things.'

229
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,975
'You are good at giving lectures
on responsibility, aren't you?'

230
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,173
'But what about you?'

231
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:45,405
'You are a scoundrel,
a dog, a liar, a beguiler..'

232
00:18:45,467 --> 00:18:49,074
'And all those cusses which you
use when you are with your friends.'

233
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:06,910
Kunal..

234
00:19:12,333 --> 00:19:13,903
Kunal!

235
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,508
Kunal..

236
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,404
Girl or boy?

237
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:33,177
What?

238
00:19:33,233 --> 00:19:34,439
Girl or boy?

239
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:36,505
What happened to you all of a sudden?

240
00:19:38,467 --> 00:19:40,572
I realised that I am
about to become a father..

241
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:43,174
And that I should stop
behaving like a child.

242
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,346
What brought about
this sudden realisation?

243
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,335
I have even thought
of a few baby names.

244
00:19:48,133 --> 00:19:51,239
Chintu, Pintu, Kamlesh, Dharmesh.

245
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:53,111
Yuck.

246
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,075
Don't be upset.

247
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,271
A have a few female names as well.

248
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:58,343
Savitri, Kamla, Sughanda, Bhanupriya.

249
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,274
Bhanupriya? Really?

250
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,911
It was my aunt's name.

251
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,343
Are you sure about this?

252
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,447
Raina, Naina, Megha..

253
00:20:11,033 --> 00:20:12,876
You just wait and watch.
We'll have a girl.

254
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:16,011
What's the point?
She'll have Malkholkar as her surname.

255
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,311
And this will continue
for nine months.

256
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:22,073
I will throw a lot of tantrums
and make a lot of demands.

257
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,539
You'll have to fulfil all of them.

258
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:27,471
I'll endure all your tantrums
and fulfil all your demands.

259
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,073
Cake!

260
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:34,338
Chocolate cake, one box sweets.

261
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:41,246
...tamarind pickle, chicken pepper fry,
poppadum, blueberry ice-cream..

262
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,501
Done? Anything else?

263
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,005
Red millet chips, tomato flavour.

264
00:20:45,467 --> 00:20:48,414
They come in three flavours
but I want tomato flavour.

265
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:49,502
S ix packets.

266
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,272
How many kids are you pregnant with?

267
00:20:53,067 --> 00:20:54,569
Kids can wait, daddy is calling you.

268
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:55,909
Okay, love you. Bye.

269
00:20:58,367 --> 00:21:00,870
Don't worry, Anna.
I'll take care of everything.

270
00:21:01,433 --> 00:21:02,411
It's my responsibility.

271
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:04,107
Yes, come in.

272
00:21:05,033 --> 00:21:06,239
I know everything .

273
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,910
What, sir?

274
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,443
I heard that you are
going to have a child.

275
00:21:10,733 --> 00:21:11,370
Yes, sir.

276
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,413
So, where's my party, sweets?

277
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:16,939
Sir, I'll keep a small
party right after my promotion.

278
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,271
Oh.

279
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:21,206
Then we'll have to
wait for another 2-3 years.

280
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,479
Here, take this box home.

281
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,802
I don't need a gift, sir.

282
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:30,971
You wished me.
That's more than enough.

283
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:36,778
Take this to my house.

284
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:38,507
Okay, sir.

285
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,276
Go.

286
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:47,243
Hello, ma'am.

287
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,938
Sir has sent this chocolate box.

288
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,708
Ma'am..

289
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,601
<i>P n'! a ma' am?</i>

290
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,678
<i>P n'! a ma' am?</i>

291
00:23:06,367 --> 00:23:09,746
Anjali! My name is Anjali!

292
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:11,038
Anjali!

293
00:23:11,233 --> 00:23:13,042
Anjali!
<i>'</i> Lei 90! I..

294
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,636
My name is Anjali!

295
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,271
Ma'am! Let go of him!

296
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,141
My name is Anjali!

297
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,076
Let go of him!

298
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,908
What did you say to her?!
- Anjali!

299
00:23:20,933 --> 00:23:23,971
Why are you staring at me?
Call her husband!

300
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:25,305
Come with me, ma'am.
- Anjali!

301
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:26,641
Ma'am..

302
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,641
Call her husband!

303
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:30,211
Come with me, madam.

304
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,874
Come with me..

305
00:23:38,067 --> 00:23:38,977
Sir..

306
00:23:58,833 --> 00:24:00,972
After how many days is this happening?

307
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,980
Her condition had
deteriorated three days back.

308
00:24:05,233 --> 00:24:07,144
But it was not so bad..

309
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,244
Priya..

310
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:13,079
Not Priya! My name is Anjali!

311
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,908
Anjali!

312
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:17,534
You are back!

313
00:24:17,767 --> 00:24:19,041
What do you want?

314
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,811
Anjali..

315
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:22,805
Who are you?

316
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:26,169
What has my wife done to you?

317
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:29,770
Why are you troubling Priya?

318
00:24:30,534 --> 00:24:32,878
Did you think about
the child she is carrying?

319
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:34,011
What do you want?

320
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:36,239
Who are you angn/ with? Tell me.

321
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,102
Who do you wish to seek revenge from!

322
00:24:39,167 --> 00:24:39,975
Tell me.

323
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,611
Get him out of here.

324
00:24:57,634 --> 00:24:59,511
Leave, I'll see you tomorrow.

325
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,778
Listen..

326
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:05,775
This..

327
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,911
Whatever that you saw..

328
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,174
Please don't tell anyone about it.

329
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:17,010
I don't know who this Anjali is.

330
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:22,514
She's possessed my wife.

331
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,512
I have tried everything.

332
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:31,213
After so many years, with guru-ji's
blessing we are going to have a child.

333
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,908
But this Anjali..

334
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:42,779
Listen, please don't
tell anyone about it.

335
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:58,509
Our boss's wife's
condition makes me sad.

336
00:25:58,967 --> 00:26:02,608
People say that she is
carrying a ghost, not a child.

337
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,844
Lobo, you never told me.

338
00:26:07,033 --> 00:26:08,706
What could I say?

339
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:11,773
You saw his condition, didn't you?

340
00:26:12,734 --> 00:26:15,442
All these years he
wasn't having a child..

341
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:18,614
And now when he is having a child,
there's this ghost.

342
00:26:19,567 --> 00:26:23,538
You know Priya has done a lot for me.

343
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,607
She's treated us like family
from the day we started working here.

344
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,010
What will the boss do now?

345
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,845
He's left no stone unturned.

346
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:39,772
There is no shrine or temple
that he hasn't prayed at.

347
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:45,106
Priya ma'am and this child
are his biggest weakness.

348
00:26:47,033 --> 00:26:49,843
He can do anything to save them.

349
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:51,876
If needed he will even marry the guru.

350
00:26:57,833 --> 00:26:59,835
Quit fooling around.

351
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:02,069
I know who will take me seriously.

352
00:27:03,934 --> 00:27:05,413
I am not joking, Nikki.

353
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,335
There were so many people there.

354
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:08,705
Why did she look at me?

355
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,374
Nikki!

356
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:15,939
I told you, you'll have your moment.

357
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:19,876
Even] fear has its moment.

358
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:21,810
And your moment has come.

359
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,738
That was your moment.

360
00:27:32,634 --> 00:27:36,946
One chicken supreme special, regular.

361
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,877
Sure, ma'am. Your order
will be there in 30 minutes.

362
00:27:38,934 --> 00:27:40,038
Thanks for calling Slices.

363
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:43,844
Lobo, one chicken special, regular.

364
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,001
Yes, sir.

365
00:27:56,834 --> 00:27:58,404
That's one special pizza.

366
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:04,537
Kunal!

367
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:11,471
Kunal!

368
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,410
Come in.

369
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:24,434
Listen..

370
00:28:24,767 --> 00:28:27,543
Here, take this box home.

371
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:28,868
My home.

372
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,506
Sure, sir.
But I have to make a deliven/..

373
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,377
Deliver this after that.

374
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,308
Yes, sir. But I have
another delivery after that.

375
00:28:36,934 --> 00:28:38,709
Do you have problem going to my house?

376
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,035
My wife won't eat you.

377
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:43,537
Take this.

378
00:28:45,467 --> 00:28:46,537
And do as you are told.

379
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,644
Go.

380
00:29:54,933 --> 00:29:56,310
Good evening, ma'am.
Pizzas.

381
00:29:57,567 --> 00:29:58,978
Good evening. Come in, please.

382
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:01,745
Keep the pizzas there.

383
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,436
"Oh, my God, I'm done for!"

384
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,605
"What the hell happened?"

385
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:09,613
"What looked like a pothole,
turned out to be a well."

386
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:10,837
How much would that be?

387
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:14,270
That's. 450, ma'am.

388
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:15,502
"A snake!"

389
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,408
"Run! A snake! Run!"

390
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,672
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose!"

391
00:30:20,734 --> 00:30:22,805
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose, run!"

392
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:24,972
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose!"

393
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,304
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose, run!"

394
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,404
"The storm's here!"

395
00:30:29,467 --> 00:30:31,572
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose, run!"

396
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,908
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose!"

397
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,578
"The storm's here!"

398
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,840
Sorry, ma'am.

399
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:40,939
I don't have change.

400
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:43,213
What if even I don't have change?
What will you do then?

401
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,743
"Who stole from whom?"

402
00:30:46,867 --> 00:30:48,574
"Who got huﬂ and how?"

403
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:56,643
Ma.

00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:06,277
Madam?

405

Hello?

406
00:31:16,634 --> 00:31:19,308
Ma'am, should I go to
the restaurant and get change?

407
00:31:21,233 --> 00:31:22,769
And what if you don't return?

408
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,704
I will, ma'am.

409
00:31:26,334 --> 00:31:27,506
I'm just joking.

410
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,308
I'll go upstairs and get the change.

411
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,878
Stay here.

412
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,270
Don't go anywhere.

413
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:56,902
Okay, ma'am.

414
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,801
Madam?

415
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:55,505
Is everything alright?

416
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:28,368
<i>Mk
“I I)</i>

417
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,042
<i>Mk

418
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:45,241
"Oh kind one, wait."

419
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:50,876
“My story's still incomplete.“

420
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:07,607
"It still lacks.."
"It still mewls."

421
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:12,880
“It's still dreary, my abode.“

422
00:39:25,034 --> 00:39:30,643
"Life.. was restricted."

423
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:37,011
“Fate.. was awry.“

424
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,038
Who's here?

425
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:35,008
What's going on?

426
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,671
Hello?

427
00:41:57,734 --> 00:41:58,678
Hello.

428
00:41:58,834 --> 00:42:00,040
Nikki! Nikki! Nikki!

429
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,579
Quickly note down this address!

430
00:42:01,767 --> 00:42:03,007
Note down this address quickly!

431
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,476
23 Smita Bungalow, Gulmohar Road.

432
00:42:05,634 --> 00:42:06,704
My bike is parked outside.

433
00:42:33,934 --> 00:42:34,969
Sir!

434
00:42:35,567 --> 00:42:36,739
Smita!

435
00:42:37,167 --> 00:42:38,737
Open the door, Smita!

436
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,477
Smita!
- Sir! The door is locked!

437
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:45,474
I know he's in there.

438
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,976
I'm coming in here, I'm killing him.

439
00:42:48,134 --> 00:42:49,204
I'm killing you.

440
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,473
Hello, sir.

441
00:42:51,534 --> 00:42:52,740
Can you hear me? Sir?

442
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,479
Witch.. In my house,
on my bed, with someone else..

443
00:42:57,634 --> 00:42:59,045
I won't spare you!

444
00:43:00,467 --> 00:43:01,639
Sir..

445
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:29,575
Hello? Hello, sir?

446
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,078
Can you hear me, sir?

447
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:32,811
You answered her phone?

448
00:43:33,134 --> 00:43:35,637
What, sir? No, sir.

449
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:37,039
You are done for.

450
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,168
You are dead.

451
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:40,606
No, sir! I...l came here
to deliver pizza, sir.

452
00:43:40,867 --> 00:43:42,744
I know what you came to deliver.

453
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,408
Open the door.

454
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,742
Today, you're both going to die.

455
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:49,412
The door is not opening, sir.

456
00:43:49,734 --> 00:43:53,113
Tell that witch to use
her key and open the door.

457
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:54,502
Please, sir.

458
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:55,807
Listen to me, sir.

459
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,375
Madam has been murdered, sir.

460
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,341
I wasn't born yesterday.

461
00:44:00,634 --> 00:44:01,704
Open the door!

462
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,935
I said, open the door!

463
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,536
I've been telling you, sir..

464
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,838
I am stuck in this bungalow!
I had come here to deliver pizza.

465
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,379
Try to understand .

466
00:44:09,834 --> 00:44:11,040
Sir..

467
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,804
Sorry, sir.

468
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,502
Sir.. Sir, please.

469
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:18,612
Please listen to me.
I came here to deliver pizza.

470
00:44:18,933 --> 00:44:21,539
Look, my bike is parked behind you.

471
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,477
Yes, your bike is here.

472
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:29,511
Okay, open the door.

473
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:30,702
I can't sir.

474
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:32,769
That's what I have been
trying to do for so long, sir.

475
00:44:32,934 --> 00:44:34,641
I am unable to open it.

476
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,943
Check the fruit basket.

477
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:38,941
There must be a key kept there.

478
00:44:58,634 --> 00:44:59,874
I still cannot open it, sir.

479
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:03,275
Sir..

480
00:45:06,867 --> 00:45:07,971
Hello?

481
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:57,738
Hello.

482
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,308
Kunal!

483
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,178
Nikki...!

484
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:24,245
Nikki!

485
00:50:25,334 --> 00:50:26,642
Kunal, are you in there?

486
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,346
Yes, I am here.

487
00:50:33,667 --> 00:50:35,146
Nikki!

488
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,370
Nikki!

489
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:51,770
Nikki!

490
00:50:53,267 --> 00:50:55,008
Nikki save me.

491
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,701
Kunal!

492
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:04,505
Nikki! Look behind you.

493
00:51:04,967 --> 00:51:06,378
Nikki, move!

494
00:51:07,433 --> 00:51:08,571
Nikki, move!

495
00:51:08,967 --> 00:51:09,945
Nikki!

496
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,103
Nikita!

497
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:22,368
Kunal!

498
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:27,268
Nikki!

499
00:51:27,467 --> 00:51:28,537
Nikki, move!

500
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:31,743
Nikita

501
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:18,835
Hello?

502
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,844
Hello?

503
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,174
Kunal!
- Nikki!

504
00:52:22,167 --> 00:52:23,339
Nikki? How did you get this number?

505
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,343
This number? I called
on your mobile phone.

506
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,138
I've been trying to
call you for so long.

507
00:52:27,267 --> 00:52:28,610
Nikki, first tell me where you are.

508
00:52:28,867 --> 00:52:30,608
You were just here.
Where are you now?

509
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,643
What's happening over there, Kunal?

510
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:33,735
I'm freaking out now.

511
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:35,306
Even I am scared, Nikki.

512
00:52:35,834 --> 00:52:37,313
I am stuck in this bungalow.

513
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:39,340
And you have called on its Iandline.

514
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:40,435
Which bunglow...

515
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,776
You were just standing
in front of me..

516
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:45,211
Did they do anything to you?

517
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:47,110
Who did what?

518
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,805
If this is a joke then
I'll kill you. Okay?

519
00:52:49,134 --> 00:52:50,477
I am not joking, Nikki.

520
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,438
Two people have been
murdered over here.

521
00:52:52,567 --> 00:52:54,205
Their dead bodies are missing.

522
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,772
I just cannot understand anything.

523
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:58,279
Kunal, just relax. I am on my way.

524
00:52:58,334 --> 00:53:00,211
I'll be there soon.

525
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:01,679
Come with the cops.
Don't come alone.

526
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:02,838
Okay, relax. I'm calling the cops.

527
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:04,170
We'll be there soon.

528
00:53:04,234 --> 00:53:05,212
Just calm down.

529
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:07,610
Hello? Nikki?

530
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:05,172
Hello, police station?

531
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:08,346
Nikki..
- Kunal, what are you doing at the police station?

532
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,210
Nikki, you've called
this horrible house again.

533
00:54:11,267 --> 00:54:13,747
No way, Kunal. I dialled
police station's number.

534
00:54:14,134 --> 00:54:15,272
No, I'm still stuck here.

535
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:16,745
Something strange is happening.

536
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,211
I don't understand anything.

537
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:20,347
I don't understand anything, Nikki.

538
00:54:20,534 --> 00:54:21,342
I am feeling very scared.

539
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,708
Don't get scared, Kunal.
Take a deep breath.

540
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:24,002
I'll go and bring the police.

541
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:25,637
Don't get scared, I am coming.

542
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,111
Hurry up, Nikki.

543
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,577
Hurry up and get the police.

544
00:54:54,134 --> 00:54:55,272
Kunal..

545
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:03,677
Don't get scared..

546
00:55:16,334 --> 00:55:17,608
Who is it?

547
00:55:18,167 --> 00:55:19,407
Show yourself!

548
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,340
Coward!

549
00:55:38,167 --> 00:55:39,976
Nikki? Where are you?

550
00:55:40,034 --> 00:55:41,911
Hello? Kunal? Kunal? What happened?

551
00:55:42,167 --> 00:55:44,477
Who is it?
- What who? It's me.

552
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:47,679
Sir?
- Listen, Kunal. I called at home.

553
00:55:47,934 --> 00:55:49,470
That box has still
not been delivered.

554
00:55:49,534 --> 00:55:51,104
Did you deliver the Pizza?

555
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,945
Sir..
- Where are you?

556
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,643
Sir, I am stuck in that house.

557
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:56,678
Kunal? Hello?
I can't hear anything.

558
00:55:56,933 --> 00:55:58,207
Kunal!
- Sir...sir..

559
00:55:58,267 --> 00:55:59,541
I can hear you. Go ahead.

560
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,311
Hello? Hello, hello?

561
00:56:01,467 --> 00:56:04,073
I can hear you. Go ahead please.

562
00:56:05,334 --> 00:56:06,472
Hello?

563
00:58:11,467 --> 00:58:12,810
Who are you?

564
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,240
Hello, papa.

565
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,404
Papa..

566
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,106
I am not your father.

567
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:41,337
Kunal...!

568
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,077
Help me, Kunal.

569
00:58:43,367 --> 00:58:44,846
Kunal, please help.

570
00:59:26,867 --> 00:59:27,811
Open

571
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,674
Open

572
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:07,974
Kunal...!

573
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:15,177
Nikki..

574
01:00:19,067 --> 01:00:20,774
Nikki.. How did you come inside?

575
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:22,202
Nikki, are you alright?

576
01:00:57,034 --> 01:00:59,605
Please help me, Kunal.

577
01:01:00,167 --> 01:01:03,273
Please help me, Kunal.

578
01:01:11,934 --> 01:01:12,912
Papa..

579
01:01:13,134 --> 01:01:15,774
Papa.. Open the door.

580
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,208
What did you do to her?

581
01:01:44,067 --> 01:01:45,603
What has she done to you?

582
01:01:47,867 --> 01:01:49,039
Where is my Nikita?

583
01:01:50,267 --> 01:01:51,746
Why are you doing this?

584
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,174
Anjali!

585
01:02:00,900 --> 01:02:02,072
Papa..

586
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,611
Please.

587
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,975
I am not your father.

588
01:02:22,934 --> 01:02:23,742
Keep it down.

589
01:02:23,834 --> 01:02:26,872
Keep it down. Keep it down.

590
01:02:29,667 --> 01:02:31,044
Sir, I don't know how
that ended up in my hand.

591
01:02:31,234 --> 01:02:32,645
Go back! Go back! Go back!

592
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:34,641
Sir.. Sir, please..
- On your knees.

593
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:36,177
Go back! Shut up!

594
01:02:37,934 --> 01:02:38,935
Keep your hands behind you.

595
01:02:40,634 --> 01:02:41,669
Why did you come here?

596
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:44,875
Sir, I came here to deliver pizza.

597
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:46,205
In the evening.

598
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:48,270
I don't know since how long
have I been in this house.

599
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,279
You came to deliver pizza.
- Yes, sir.

600
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:51,904
Here?
- Yes.

601
01:02:52,067 --> 01:02:53,512
This house has been
locked since four years.

602
01:02:53,567 --> 01:02:54,272
And you came here..

603
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:55,743
What is this?

604
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,070
These aren't ribbons.

605
01:02:57,500 --> 01:02:59,502
This is police
marking. Can't you see?

606
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:01,744
Sir..

607
01:03:02,067 --> 01:03:03,239
What are you saying, sir?

608
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,638
A whole family stays here.

609
01:03:06,867 --> 01:03:08,278
What game are you playing?

610
01:03:09,067 --> 01:03:10,137
You have come here to
cover up, haven't you?

611
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,173
You have come here to cover up?
- No, sir.

612
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:15,738
You killed the three
of them, didn't you?

613
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:19,107
Killed them? No, sir. No.

614
01:03:20,734 --> 01:03:22,441
I just don't understand.

615
01:03:22,834 --> 01:03:23,972
Nikki.. Where's Nikita, sir?

616
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:25,202
Where is Nikita?

617
01:03:27,134 --> 01:03:28,169
Wait a minute..

618
01:03:28,867 --> 01:03:29,868
Three?

619
01:03:31,134 --> 01:03:32,078
Who three, sir?

620
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:34,873
That couple and that woman.

621
01:03:35,434 --> 01:03:37,675
Woman? Which woman?

622
01:03:38,034 --> 01:03:39,604
Are you going to interrogate us?

623
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:40,668
What is her name?

624
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,480
We don't carry names and
addresses of dead bodies on us.

625
01:03:43,667 --> 01:03:45,169
Sir, please. Let's call Nikita.
Everything will be clear.

626
01:03:45,434 --> 01:03:48,506
Who Nikita?
- She's the reason you are here.

627
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,876
Sir, I am sure..

628
01:03:49,934 --> 01:03:51,743
I am sure he has killed that couple.

629
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:52,608
No, sir.
- Yes, sir.

630
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:53,668
No, sir.
- He is just pretending otherwise.

631
01:03:53,733 --> 01:03:54,609
Let me go, sir.

632
01:03:54,734 --> 01:04:00,184
If you try to run, I'll bury
you alive along with that girl.

633
01:04:03,567 --> 01:04:04,705
Sir, please.

634
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:06,511
Please give me your phone.

635
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:09,538
I'll talk to Nikki.
Everything will be clear.

636
01:04:10,067 --> 01:04:11,045
Please, sir. Give me your phone.

637
01:04:11,067 --> 01:04:12,011
Phone.

638
01:04:14,667 --> 01:04:15,577
Call her.

639
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,940
Nikita, CM, PM.. Call
whomever you want to.

640
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,945
Put it on the speaker.

641
01:04:22,967 --> 01:04:25,379
'This number is
temporarily unavailable.'

642
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:27,604
Done? Yes?

643
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:33,907
Sir.. Sir, contact the control room.

644
01:04:34,033 --> 01:04:35,944
I am sure Nikita must
have lodged a complaint.

645
01:04:36,434 --> 01:04:38,505
And you ask them that girl's name.

646
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:40,039
Please.

647
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:42,436
Hey.
- Sir.

648
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,071
Shinde, did you get any complain..
- Sir, please, listen to me.

649
01:04:47,467 --> 01:04:49,777
Something is very wrong here. Please sir.
- Shut up!

650
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:54,104
Sir..

651
01:04:55,567 --> 01:04:57,444
No complaint has
been registered, sir.

652
01:04:57,634 --> 01:04:59,545
And no girl named Nikita
came to the police station.

653
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:01,940
Speak up.

654
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:05,678
Did you hear that?
- Heard what?

655
01:05:05,833 --> 01:05:08,074
You didn't hear it, sir?
- What?

656
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,980
Sir, can we please go to the
police station for questioning?

657
01:05:11,034 --> 01:05:14,675
Please sir... Let go!
- Why...

658
01:05:17,834 --> 01:05:20,474
Let go of my leg!

659
01:05:30,467 --> 01:05:31,502
Nikki!

660
01:05:35,534 --> 01:05:36,672
Nikki!

661
01:05:47,967 --> 01:05:50,846
'This number is
temporarily unavailable.'

662
01:05:53,567 --> 01:05:55,308
Hurry up, please!

663
01:05:59,467 --> 01:06:01,538
Lobo! Stop! Stop! Stop!

664
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:04,041
Lobo!

665
01:06:06,467 --> 01:06:07,969
Where are you? What's
wrong with your phone?

666
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,944
And where's your bike?

667
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:10,001
Nikita.

668
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:11,542
Nikita.

669
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,510
What...? What happened?

670
01:06:12,734 --> 01:06:13,712
Come with me to the police station.

671
01:06:13,767 --> 01:06:16,748
Police station? Why? First
let's go and meet the boss.

672
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,040
He's waiting for you.

673
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:19,812
But Lobo, Nikki is missing.

674
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,802
Kunal, we will find Nikita.

675
01:06:21,867 --> 01:06:23,869
Let's go and meet boss
first. Tell him your problem.

676
01:06:23,934 --> 01:06:25,004
He will solve it.

677
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:26,245
Come on. Come with me.

678
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:27,005
Try to.. What are you doing, Lobo?

679
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:28,235
Come on, Kunal. Come with me.

680
01:06:28,367 --> 01:06:29,345
Let's go.
- No.

681
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,435
What are you doing?
- Let's go to the police station.

682
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:31,478
Kunal..
- Let go of me!

683
01:06:40,734 --> 01:06:43,715
Kunal! Kunal!

684
01:06:43,934 --> 01:06:46,437
Catch him!

685
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:49,541
Slop!

686
01:06:50,834 --> 01:06:52,006
Catch him!

687
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,377
Catch him!

688
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:06,941
Catch him!

689
01:07:09,333 --> 01:07:10,607
Scoundrel!

690
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:20,506
I wish..

691
01:07:21,534 --> 01:07:23,207
I wish I had some change on me.

692
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:27,743
I lost everything I had
to that house for fifty bucks.

693
01:07:29,234 --> 01:07:30,907
Nikita is still missing.

694
01:07:32,234 --> 01:07:33,713
Her phone is switched off.

695
01:07:34,334 --> 01:07:38,407
Sir, everything has been going
wrong for me since I met your wife.

696
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,780
Hey, stop your nonsense.

697
01:07:40,933 --> 01:07:42,708
I am telling the truth, Lobo.

698
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,836
Anjali was in that house.

699
01:07:46,234 --> 01:07:48,475
Please call up your wife and ask.

700
01:07:48,534 --> 01:07:50,707
Maybe she knows
something about Nikita.

701
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:52,777
Please let me go, sir.

702
01:07:53,534 --> 01:07:56,515
I need to go and find Nikita.
Please let me go.

703
01:07:58,934 --> 01:08:00,880
Sorry, I hit you.

704
01:08:01,434 --> 01:08:03,277
I was really upset.

705
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,609
Please come with me.

706
01:08:08,433 --> 01:08:12,210
Where are your bike and your bag?

707
01:08:13,434 --> 01:08:16,244
Sir, Nikita is pregnant and missing.

708
01:08:16,534 --> 01:08:18,673
And you are asking me
about the bag and the bike?

709
01:08:20,334 --> 01:08:23,213
I left it at the bungalow
and then I came here, sir.

710
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:32,146
Don't get too excited.

711
01:08:33,833 --> 01:08:35,813
That girl will come
back sooner or later.

712
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:41,475
And if she doesn't you
can go to the police station.

713
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,873
And keep me out of this.

714
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:52,204
Why is Anjali doing this to me?

715
01:08:52,467 --> 01:08:54,811
She's troubling everyone.
Everyone!

716
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:57,144
Look"

717
01:08:57,567 --> 01:09:00,741
Look at him.
He's gone crazy, poor guy.

718
01:09:03,367 --> 01:09:06,507
Listen, you stay
with him for a few days.

719
01:09:08,567 --> 01:09:09,671
Take care of him.

720
01:09:09,834 --> 01:09:10,778
Okay, sir.

721
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,670
What did you say the
name of that bungalow was?

722
01:09:29,267 --> 01:09:31,178
Go. Get the bike.

723
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,446
Sir, you come with me.

724
01:09:37,767 --> 01:09:39,440
Coward.

725
01:09:52,067 --> 01:09:53,341
What does your wife do?

726
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:56,171
She was a writer, sir.

727
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:59,548
Was? You are already talking
about her in the past tense?

728
01:10:01,667 --> 01:10:04,648
All this mud on your clothes.

729
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:07,578
Were you playing Kabadi?

730
01:10:08,367 --> 01:10:11,348
No, sir. He..
- Sir, I fell from a bike.

731
01:10:13,601 --> 01:10:15,410
What about your family and hers?

732
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:22,543
I have no one, sir.

733
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:28,440
And a few years ago
in an accident her family..

734
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:32,169
She has a grandfather, sir.

735
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:38,479
Did you two have any issues
with any one? Any problems?

736
01:10:39,067 --> 01:10:40,239
No, sir.

737
01:10:40,967 --> 01:10:42,275
Not at all, sir.

738
01:10:44,334 --> 01:10:46,109
When was the last time you saw her?

739
01:10:51,167 --> 01:10:52,441
Yesterday morning.

740
01:10:54,534 --> 01:10:58,573
Give your wife's photograph
to constable Tambe over there.

741
01:10:59,501 --> 01:11:00,707
We'll start the investigation.

742
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:03,340
We won't be able to know
anything before 48 hours.

743
01:11:16,667 --> 01:11:21,480
The number you are calling
is switched off.

744
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:37,711
She had promised me..

745
01:11:39,267 --> 01:11:41,406
That she'll never leave me.

746
01:11:43,234 --> 01:11:47,182
Look, you have never
hurt anyone, right?

747
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:51,171
Then why will anything
bad happen to you?

748
01:11:52,067 --> 01:11:54,138
I shouldn't have gone
to boss's house the other day.

749
01:12:13,134 --> 01:12:14,272
Uncle..

750
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:15,672
Uncle!

751
01:12:16,634 --> 01:12:18,307
Why is his bungalow locked?

752
01:12:19,301 --> 01:12:21,042
This bungalow is ominous.

753
01:12:21,667 --> 01:12:23,010
Ominous? Why?

754
01:12:23,234 --> 01:12:28,240
Bad luck follows anyone
who goes inside the bungalow.

755
01:12:29,567 --> 01:12:30,671
What's happened in this bungalow?

756
01:12:31,067 --> 01:12:35,982
The couple who lived
here fought all the time.

757
01:12:37,134 --> 01:12:43,346
The guy suspected that the child his
wife was carrying was someone else's.

758
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:49,540
One night, in the fit of anger,
he axed his wife to death.

759
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,474
After that.

760
01:12:55,467 --> 01:12:56,445
He killed himself as well.

761
01:12:57,234 --> 01:12:59,077
And then?

762
01:12:59,300 --> 01:13:06,218
Sir, after a few months people around
the bungalow heard someone crying inside.

763
01:13:06,534 --> 01:13:09,310
They even filed a
complaint with the police.

764
01:13:09,567 --> 01:13:11,547
Two cops had come to enquire.

765
01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:14,241
But they didn't come out.

766
01:13:15,401 --> 01:13:17,972
The next day their
dead bodies were found.

767
01:13:18,267 --> 01:13:20,873
Who? How? When?

768
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,145
Hello?

769
01:13:25,201 --> 01:13:26,839
It's me, Anna.
- Yes, sir.

770
01:13:26,967 --> 01:13:28,071
I didn't get my stuff.

771
01:13:28,134 --> 01:13:29,204
Sir, there has been a delay.

772
01:13:29,267 --> 01:13:32,305
I don't need any excuses.
- Please listen to me, sir.

773
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:33,573
L..
- Listen to me.

774
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:35,373
Yes, sir.
- If anything happens to it..

775
01:13:35,534 --> 01:13:37,343
I won't spare you.
- Sir...

776
01:13:44,034 --> 01:13:46,537
You can wear a cap only
if you have a head left.

777
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:48,612
Don't go to that house.

778
01:13:51,534 --> 01:13:53,343
Stay away from that house.

779
01:13:54,567 --> 01:13:56,604
That house is your doom.

780
01:13:59,567 --> 01:14:01,103
Kunal..

781
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,580
Kunal. Wake up.

782
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:09,237
There's an order.

783
01:14:11,434 --> 01:14:12,572
What is this?

784
01:14:13,201 --> 01:14:14,407
What are you doing with a knife?

785
01:14:18,534 --> 01:14:20,070
What are you doing, Kunal?

786
01:14:21,334 --> 01:14:22,540
Have you lost your mind?

787
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,506
Kunal!

788
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:28,172
Have you lost your mind?

789
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,978
I said stop it!

790
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:34,773
What are you doing, Kunal?

791
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:37,440
I said stop it!

792
01:14:44,334 --> 01:14:45,904
Wait.

793
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,275
Keep an eye on him.

794
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:55,305
Make sure he doesn't
get hold of knives or blades.

795
01:14:56,067 --> 01:14:59,014
He's becoming a threat to everyone.

796
01:15:05,267 --> 01:15:06,337
Hello?
- Hello.

797
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,141
Yes, Rane. It's me, Pandey.

798
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:09,111
Yes, you had called me?

799
01:15:09,167 --> 01:15:11,773
Yes, I had called. How are you?

800
01:15:11,834 --> 01:15:12,835
Fine, sir.

801
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:16,479
Listen, did you get any
leads on that missing girl?

802
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:18,246
Nothing unusual, sir.

803
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,207
Her parents died in an accident.

804
01:15:21,367 --> 01:15:22,846
She was a struggling writer..
- Yes.

805
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,140
She was having an affair with
that boy and then she married him.

806
01:15:26,167 --> 01:15:27,202
Okay, thanks.

807
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:36,908
Sir, Mr. Pandey's call.

808
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:39,144
Yes, sir.

809
01:15:39,267 --> 01:15:41,178
I didn't get much
information about the girl.

810
01:15:41,767 --> 01:15:43,405
But let me tell you something,
Mr. Kapoor.

811
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,107
This boy is not as
innocent as he looks.

812
01:15:46,834 --> 01:15:48,211
I am sure he..
- Sir.

813
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,471
It's not like that sir.
He loves her a lot.

814
01:15:51,234 --> 01:15:53,407
Nowadays people kill
because of love, sir.

815
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:54,938
I see this everyday.

816
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:57,169
Either the boy kills the girl.

817
01:15:57,367 --> 01:15:59,904
Or the girl's lover
kills the boyfriend.

818
01:16:00,267 --> 01:16:02,907
In your case, I suspect the boy.

819
01:16:03,234 --> 01:16:06,147
Let me keep him for a day,
I'll make him confess the truth.

820
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:08,040
No, sir. Let it be.

821
01:16:08,201 --> 01:16:10,272
Please continue your investigation.

822
01:16:10,767 --> 01:16:12,269
And let me know if you find anything.

823
01:16:12,334 --> 01:16:13,438
Okay, sir?
- Okay, sir.

824
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:15,177
Bye.
- Bye, sir.

825
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,806
Grease his palms and
get more information.

826
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,070
Got it?

827
01:16:57,067 --> 01:16:58,171
Come in.

828
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:02,978
Are you alright?

829
01:17:07,067 --> 01:17:08,705
You cannot be.

830
01:17:09,734 --> 01:17:10,872
No, sir. I am fine.

831
01:17:12,967 --> 01:17:15,004
I have brought this
for you from Narsovawadi.

832
01:17:15,334 --> 01:17:16,870
Keep it with you.

833
01:17:18,067 --> 01:17:19,307
It is very powerful.

834
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:22,781
As long as it is with you,
no one can cause you any harm.

835
01:17:23,867 --> 01:17:24,868
Okay, sir.

836
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:27,911
Do you get scared making deliveries?

837
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,080
That's why I don't
do deliveries post 6:00pm.

838
01:17:32,001 --> 01:17:32,979
Okay.

839
01:17:48,134 --> 01:17:50,842
Last warning.
I am giving you the last warning.

840
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:53,004
We will break the shop tomorrow.

841
01:17:53,067 --> 01:17:54,603
Give me one day, please.

842
01:17:54,867 --> 01:17:57,871
If we don't get our thing till tomorrow,
then you are gone.

843
01:17:57,934 --> 01:17:59,845
Trust me, you will get.

844
01:18:22,134 --> 01:18:23,272
What happened, sir?

845
01:18:27,534 --> 01:18:28,877
They will break the shop tomorrow.

846
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:30,535
What...?

847
01:18:30,934 --> 01:18:32,106
We'll have to go there.

848
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:46,513
Sir, please.
Don't go inside this house.

849
01:18:47,034 --> 01:18:48,206
Anjali is in this house.

850
01:18:49,167 --> 01:18:50,202
Please don't go, sir.

851
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:54,144
Lobo, please don't go.

852
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:55,110
Keep quiet and stay here.

853
01:18:55,134 --> 01:18:56,511
Please sir, listen to me.
- We'll be back soon.

854
01:18:56,634 --> 01:18:57,908
Sir..

855
01:19:22,867 --> 01:19:23,937
It's open, sir.

856
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,137
What?
- It's open.

857
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,604
Check the bike.

858
01:20:01,934 --> 01:20:03,174
Sir, batch...

859
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:11,639
What happened?

860
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:13,773
The bag is not here, sir.

861
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:17,837
It must be inside.

862
01:20:18,201 --> 01:20:19,942
Yes. Let's go.

863
01:20:28,634 --> 01:20:30,511
Come on, let's go inside.

864
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:07,872
The bag, sir.

865
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,704
Sir..

866
01:22:53,467 --> 01:22:55,970
Hurry up and open the door.

867
01:22:56,467 --> 01:22:58,504
Hurry up and open the door.

868
01:22:59,301 --> 01:23:01,303
Hurry up and open the door.

869
01:23:11,467 --> 01:23:13,310
Kunal! Kunal!
- Open the door, Kunal!

870
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,080
Kunal!
- Open the door, Kunal!

871
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:17,470
Kunal, open..

872
01:23:17,734 --> 01:23:20,442
Open the door!
- Open the door! Hurry up!

873
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:23,638
Get in, quickly!

874
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:24,644
The key..

875
01:23:24,834 --> 01:23:25,812
Where is the key?

876
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:28,971
Kunal, we saw..
- Shut up!

877
01:23:29,567 --> 01:23:30,443
No one will say anything.

878
01:23:30,634 --> 01:23:32,238
No one will say anything. Got it?

879
01:23:32,301 --> 01:23:33,507
But why? What happened inside?

880
01:23:33,567 --> 01:23:35,706
Just shut up. Everyone keep quiet.

881
01:23:43,934 --> 01:23:44,912
Sir, please.

882
01:23:45,234 --> 01:23:46,611
Please tell me what
happened in that house.

883
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,245
Who was in that house, sir?

884
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:52,307
Was it that woman or that kid?

885
01:23:52,801 --> 01:23:54,405
Lobo, you tell me.

886
01:23:54,734 --> 01:23:56,611
For our friendship's sake.

887
01:23:58,267 --> 01:24:00,269
Sameer, you tell me.

888
01:24:00,434 --> 01:24:01,913
What did you see over there?

889
01:24:06,534 --> 01:24:08,241
Will someone say something?

890
01:24:08,467 --> 01:24:09,969
Why did you go to that house!

891
01:24:10,301 --> 01:24:11,575
I told you not to go there.

892
01:24:13,667 --> 01:24:15,669
Just like that house
took my Nikita from me..

893
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,937
It will take away
something dear to you.

894
01:24:21,900 --> 01:24:23,937
I somehow managed to get out of there.

895
01:24:24,834 --> 01:24:26,905
But that house didn't leave me alone.

896
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:32,240
Now I feel as if someone
is always with me.

897
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,737
Someone is staring at me,
following me.

898
01:24:38,367 --> 01:24:40,745
When I sleep I feel
as if someone is next to me.

899
01:24:44,434 --> 01:24:45,242
Papa!

900
01:24:45,301 --> 01:24:46,575
Someone is trying to talk to me.

901
01:24:46,634 --> 01:24:47,908
Papa!
<i>'</i> Yes!

902
01:24:48,434 --> 01:24:49,276
No!

903
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,535
Kunal, have you lost your mind?

904
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:52,179
What are you doing, Kunal?

905
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,910
Sir.. I beg you.

906
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:57,177
Please tell me.

907
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,304
Don't hide it from me.

908
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:01,312
What did you see in that house?

909
01:25:03,201 --> 01:25:04,236
Tell me.

910
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:07,643
Will no one tell me?

911
01:25:08,900 --> 01:25:12,279
At least tell me whether
my Nikita will return or not.

912
01:25:13,334 --> 01:25:14,312
Yes?

913
01:25:20,567 --> 01:25:21,409
Fine.

914
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:24,738
I considered you as more than friends.

915
01:25:24,867 --> 01:25:26,141
That was my mistake.

916
01:25:29,201 --> 01:25:30,805
I will find Nikita on my own.

917
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,208
In this world or the next.

918
01:25:34,601 --> 01:25:36,376
I will meet Nikita.

919
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:53,204
Guru-ji, please do something.

920
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:19,578
Sir..

921
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:21,438
What did guru-ji say?

922
01:26:24,234 --> 01:26:26,214
What was common between Priya,
Nikita..

923
01:26:26,267 --> 01:26:31,080
...and that woman who
was murdered in that house?

924
01:26:31,367 --> 01:26:32,539
What?

925
01:26:33,034 --> 01:26:34,513
They are all pregnant.

926
01:26:37,334 --> 01:26:42,750
And along with that woman,
the child she was carrying, also died.

927
01:26:44,034 --> 01:26:45,638
And it took Anjali's form.

928
01:26:46,434 --> 01:26:51,315
Now it has become a ghost
and is hunting for a womb.

929
01:26:51,734 --> 01:26:54,647
And whenever it gets
a chance it possesses my wife.

930
01:26:56,067 --> 01:26:57,068
But..

931
01:26:57,367 --> 01:27:01,042
The day Nikita went to
that house to help Kunal..

932
01:27:01,201 --> 01:27:02,737
It possessed Nikita.

933
01:27:03,734 --> 01:27:05,714
Sir, does that mean that
Nikita won't be coming back?

934
01:27:06,067 --> 01:27:07,512
You saw Nikita in that house,
didn't you?

935
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:09,238
Did you look at her condition?

936
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:13,405
Sir, no matter what,
we have to tell Kunal the truth.

937
01:27:14,267 --> 01:27:15,268
Yes, sir.

938
01:27:15,434 --> 01:27:17,277
He's looking for her everywhere.

939
01:27:18,667 --> 01:27:20,374
If Nikita's leaves that house,
Anjali's ghost.

940
01:27:20,434 --> 01:27:25,179
...will once again
try to possess my wife.

941
01:27:26,567 --> 01:27:32,017
Look, we are going to have
a child after such a longtime.

942
01:27:33,967 --> 01:27:39,713
And in that house whether
Nikita is alive or not..

943
01:27:40,334 --> 01:27:41,745
We don't even know that.

944
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,179
And as long as Nikita
stays in that ominous house..

945
01:27:45,334 --> 01:27:47,336
Priya and our child will remain safe.

946
01:27:54,200 --> 01:27:55,372
Sir, what will we tell Kunal?

947
01:27:56,201 --> 01:28:00,479
I'll talk to Kunal and make him
leave this place as soon as possible.

948
01:28:01,634 --> 01:28:06,083
That poor guy will live on in the hope
that one day Nikita will come back.

949
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:13,048
And if you want your
sister Priya to stay safe..

950
01:28:14,534 --> 01:28:18,346
Then please,
don't tell Kunal the truth.

951
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:22,012
Promise me.

952
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:26,104
Promise me, please.

953
01:28:28,034 --> 01:28:28,671
But Kunal..

954
01:28:28,934 --> 01:28:32,313
Whatever that needs
to be done with Kunal..

955
01:28:32,501 --> 01:28:34,174
Whatever needs to be told to him,
I'll tell him.

956
01:28:34,334 --> 01:28:35,540
I am there.

957
01:28:36,101 --> 01:28:37,603
I am there, believe me.

958
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,101
But..

959
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,071
Please help me.

960
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,445
Come.. Come in.

961
01:29:19,834 --> 01:29:21,472
Are you going on a delivery?

962
01:29:22,267 --> 01:29:23,837
Yes, sir.

963
01:29:24,301 --> 01:29:26,577
Sir, I wanted to ask you a question.

964
01:29:27,967 --> 01:29:29,503
What did guru-ji tell you yesterday?

965
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:34,609
Just that Nikita will come back soon.

966
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:40,140
I, too, feel that
I'll be meeting her soon.

967
01:29:42,434 --> 01:29:44,141
Why don't do you do one thing..

968
01:29:45,167 --> 01:29:47,443
Why don't you take a few days off?

969
01:29:48,367 --> 01:29:49,971
You will get some rest.

970
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:51,204
Right?

971
01:29:52,867 --> 01:29:54,904
Leave for your village
tomorrow itself.

972
01:29:54,967 --> 01:29:55,968
Okay?

973
01:29:59,167 --> 01:30:01,841
But sir, what if Nikita calls?

974
01:30:02,834 --> 01:30:04,507
Then we will contact you.

975
01:30:07,267 --> 01:30:08,575
Don't worn].

976
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:11,073
Take a break from this mess.

977
01:30:11,234 --> 01:30:12,338
You will feel better.

978
01:30:13,100 --> 01:30:14,135
Okay?

979
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,338
Okay.

980
01:30:19,401 --> 01:30:22,280
Here's some money. Keep it.

981
01:30:23,267 --> 01:30:24,507
You might need it.

982
01:31:02,901 --> 01:31:12,879
"You were just here,
but you are here no more."

983
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:23,412
"Where have you disappeared
all of a sudden?"

984
01:31:27,167 --> 01:31:32,446
"Now it's like all
my dreams have left."

985
01:31:32,501 --> 01:31:41,148
"Now it's like no
will left in me to live."

986
01:31:41,501 --> 01:31:47,144
"You just left me alone."

987
01:31:47,334 --> 01:31:52,044
"You just left me alone."

988
01:31:52,234 --> 01:31:59,277
"You just left me alone."

989
01:32:24,167 --> 01:32:29,446
"You just left me alone."

990
01:32:35,701 --> 01:32:36,736
You are late, my ghost.

991
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,744
It takes time to come
here from the ghost world.

992
01:32:42,134 --> 01:32:44,341
You better stick to horror,
romance is not your cup of tea.

993
01:32:44,734 --> 01:32:46,304
I'll push you.

994
01:33:13,934 --> 01:33:14,776
Yes, tell me?

995
01:33:14,834 --> 01:33:15,710
What should I say?

996
01:33:15,867 --> 01:33:16,777
You are still there?

997
01:33:17,067 --> 01:33:18,068
Where else should I be?

998
01:33:18,467 --> 01:33:19,741
Your wife is pregnant.

999
01:33:20,034 --> 01:33:22,241
So it's obvious that
you should be with your wife.

1000
01:33:22,634 --> 01:33:24,045
I'm on overtime.

1001
01:33:24,801 --> 01:33:25,802
Hurry Up-

1002
01:33:26,167 --> 01:33:27,669
I haven't eaten anything.

1003
01:33:27,867 --> 01:33:29,039
I am starving.

1004
01:33:30,234 --> 01:33:31,235
I have an idea.

1005
01:33:32,367 --> 01:33:34,369
When I send a text message,
order pizzas.

1006
01:33:34,700 --> 01:33:35,804
I'll bring them home.

1007
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:45,836
Sir, this is today's collections.

1008
01:33:51,867 --> 01:33:53,312
Good evening,
thanks for calling Slices Pizza.

1009
01:33:53,400 --> 01:33:54,378
Hi, sexy.

1010
01:33:54,667 --> 01:33:55,907
Yes, ma'am. What will be the order?

1011
01:33:56,167 --> 01:33:58,147
A pizza boy, smoking hot.

1012
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,777
Thanks for calling Slices Pizza.

1013
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:01,676
Your order will be
ready in 30 minutes.

1014
01:34:02,134 --> 01:34:04,080
Lobo, one chicken special, regular.

1015
01:34:08,634 --> 01:34:10,011
Hello?
- It's me. Anna.

1016
01:34:10,801 --> 01:34:11,905
Its urgent, listen to me.

1017
01:34:12,067 --> 01:34:13,171
Just a minute.

1018
01:34:16,967 --> 01:34:19,607
Listen carefully.
Police has arrested my man.

1019
01:34:20,601 --> 01:34:22,603
We will get into trouble
if he rats us out.

1020
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:24,140
They might raid your shop.

1021
01:34:24,934 --> 01:34:26,208
Move the goods from there.

1022
01:34:26,700 --> 01:34:28,771
What is this, Anna?
You said everything will be safe.

1023
01:34:28,834 --> 01:34:29,835
What's happening?

1024
01:34:30,001 --> 01:34:33,278
You'll have to take a risk
if you want to make a fast buck.

1025
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,108
Get it out of the shop quickly.

1026
01:34:35,567 --> 01:34:36,875
I'll come after two
days and pick it up.

1027
01:34:47,667 --> 01:34:48,702
Kunal!

1028
01:34:52,201 --> 01:34:54,943
Here, take this box home.

1029
01:34:55,567 --> 01:34:56,170
My home.

1030
01:34:56,234 --> 01:34:58,714
Sure, sir.
But I have to make a deliven/..

1031
01:34:58,934 --> 01:35:00,277
My wife won't eat you.

1032
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:07,977
Here you go, it was super.

1033
01:35:09,134 --> 01:35:11,307
Change quickly. I am starving.

1034
01:35:11,834 --> 01:35:13,677
No. I need to go to boss's house.

1035
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:14,701
I need to deliver something.

1036
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,778
Chocolates!

1037
01:35:18,034 --> 01:35:18,910
For me?

1038
01:35:18,967 --> 01:35:20,878
Nikki, it belongs to my boss.
Don't touch it.

1039
01:35:21,167 --> 01:35:23,977
So what? I'll take a few.
He won't even know.

1040
01:35:24,601 --> 01:35:25,944
Don't irritate me.

1041
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,004
Kunal..

1042
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,202
Uncut diamonds.

1043
01:35:45,567 --> 01:35:48,047
They must be worth millions.

1044
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:51,102
Nikki, keep it back
in the box, please.

1045
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:55,744
Nikki, please.

1046
01:35:58,767 --> 01:36:00,678
What if we don't return them?

1047
01:36:00,901 --> 01:36:01,971
Don't talk nonsense.

1048
01:36:02,867 --> 01:36:04,141
I'll deliver in a few months.

1049
01:36:04,867 --> 01:36:09,009
Don't you want our child to get
all the happiness that we didn't get?

1050
01:36:10,667 --> 01:36:14,740
Kunal, if you cannot deliver a
pizza in 30 minutes then it's a waste.

1051
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,672
Life too is somewhat like that.

1052
01:36:17,867 --> 01:36:20,575
What's the point of finding
happiness when we are 50?

1053
01:36:21,601 --> 01:36:23,205
When will we live our life?

1054
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,635
No, Nikki.

1055
01:36:28,067 --> 01:36:29,740
I cannot betray my boss.

1056
01:36:30,567 --> 01:36:31,705
He is a nice man.

1057
01:36:32,434 --> 01:36:33,777
This isn't about humanity.

1058
01:36:34,134 --> 01:36:35,477
It is about opportunity.

1059
01:36:36,467 --> 01:36:39,505
And we will never get
such an opportunity again.

1060
01:36:51,867 --> 01:36:52,971
But how?

1061
01:36:54,100 --> 01:36:55,511
Where will we go?

1062
01:36:57,201 --> 01:36:58,441
Just a minute.

1063
01:36:59,634 --> 01:37:04,549
When I don't go back to the pizza
parlour, my boss will call the police.

1064
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:06,780
We'll have to cozen your boss.

1065
01:37:07,967 --> 01:37:09,173
Something believable.

1066
01:37:12,134 --> 01:37:14,546
Everyone has a weakness.

1067
01:37:15,767 --> 01:37:19,010
He too must have one.
- Yes. He does.

1068
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:21,441
Ghost. Superstition.

1069
01:37:22,034 --> 01:37:23,775
So that's how the story should be..

1070
01:37:30,634 --> 01:37:33,080
'Not Priya! My name is Anjali!'

1071
01:37:33,634 --> 01:37:35,079
'I don't know who this Anjali is.'

1072
01:37:37,801 --> 01:37:41,715
'Priya ma'am and this child
are his biggest weakness.'

1073
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,843
'People say that she is
carrying a ghost, not a child.'

1074
01:38:02,634 --> 01:38:03,806
Good evening, ma'am.
Pizzas.

1075
01:38:04,367 --> 01:38:05,402
Good evening.

1076
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:31,805
According to the plan
the bike will be here.

1077
01:38:32,001 --> 01:38:33,537
You keep the pizza bag inside.

1078
01:38:33,701 --> 01:38:34,805
Anything else?

1079
01:38:36,067 --> 01:38:37,512
What are you doing?

1080
01:38:41,067 --> 01:38:41,977
What happened?

1081
01:38:42,034 --> 01:38:43,035
Whose call is it?

1082
01:38:46,867 --> 01:38:47,868
Oh! Now what?

1083
01:38:52,734 --> 01:38:54,338
Nikita! Help me, Nikita!

1084
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:56,377
Hello? Kunal?
What happened?

1085
01:38:56,901 --> 01:38:58,744
Who is it?
- What who? It's me.

1086
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:01,403
Sir? - Listen, Kunal.
I called at home.

1087
01:39:01,567 --> 01:39:02,875
That box has still not
been delivered.

1088
01:39:03,367 --> 01:39:04,744
Did you deliver the Pizza?

1089
01:39:04,967 --> 01:39:07,914
Hello, sir.. - Where are you?
I cannot get through to your number.

1090
01:39:08,034 --> 01:39:09,377
Sir, I am stuck in that house.

1091
01:39:09,501 --> 01:39:10,741
Hello? I can't hear anything.

1092
01:39:10,900 --> 01:39:12,402
Kunal!
- Sir.. I can hear you.

1093
01:39:12,534 --> 01:39:13,706
Hello? Hello?

1094
01:39:17,867 --> 01:39:21,474
I wonder where he is!
You two go and find him.

1095
01:39:22,001 --> 01:39:24,413
Boss will come here
for his box of chocolates.

1096
01:39:25,301 --> 01:39:26,405
I don't know when.

1097
01:39:26,834 --> 01:39:28,711
But whenever he comes,
you be ready for him.

1098
01:39:28,967 --> 01:39:32,346
Scare him in such a way that he
never looks back at this house again.

1099
01:39:33,001 --> 01:39:34,639
Okay? I'll see you.

1100
01:39:34,967 --> 01:39:36,002
Good luck.

1101
01:39:38,901 --> 01:39:40,005
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1102
01:39:41,734 --> 01:39:42,769
Where have you been?

1103
01:39:43,367 --> 01:39:44,277
What are you doing, Lobo?

1104
01:39:44,434 --> 01:39:45,572
Let go of me.

1105
01:39:46,601 --> 01:39:47,636
Kunal..

1106
01:39:49,434 --> 01:39:50,606
Anjali was in that house.

1107
01:39:52,767 --> 01:39:55,509
Where are your bike and your bag?

1108
01:39:55,834 --> 01:39:58,474
I left it at the bungalow
and then I came here, sir.

1109
01:39:59,801 --> 01:40:02,941
Look at him. He's gone crazy.

1110
01:40:10,534 --> 01:40:11,342
Hello?

1111
01:40:11,600 --> 01:40:14,012
Hello, Nikki?
I think they are convinced.

1112
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:15,510
Everything is going fine.

1113
01:40:15,634 --> 01:40:18,478
Listen, don't get
out until I tell you to.

1114
01:40:19,800 --> 01:40:20,744
What are you doing at moment?

1115
01:40:20,801 --> 01:40:22,644
I am getting ready to welcome them.

1116
01:40:24,500 --> 01:40:25,535
We'll have to go there.

1117
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:34,777
No, sir. I won't go inside.

1118
01:41:18,534 --> 01:41:20,241
Why did you go to that house!

1119
01:41:20,501 --> 01:41:21,741
I told you not to go there.

1120
01:41:22,234 --> 01:41:24,271
Just like that house
took my Nikita from me..

1121
01:41:24,467 --> 01:41:26,174
It will take away
something dear to you.

1122
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,181
Here's some money. Keep it.

1123
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:42,174
Thank you, sir.

1124
01:41:45,900 --> 01:41:46,742
Wow.

1125
01:41:46,834 --> 01:41:48,836
That means we get the
pizza as well as the toppings.

1126
01:41:49,767 --> 01:41:53,214
I cannot believe that we are
going to start afresh from tomorrow.

1127
01:41:53,834 --> 01:41:57,907
Okay, I'm leaving.
Be at the airport by 10:00 pm.

1128
01:41:58,467 --> 01:41:59,502
And you?

1129
01:42:00,333 --> 01:42:02,404
I'm going to deliver
the last pizza of my life.

1130
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:06,673
Then run! Or they'll deduct
150 bucks from your salary.

1131
01:42:39,101 --> 01:42:40,102
Pizza

1132
01:42:42,367 --> 01:42:43,607
Just a minute. Hey kid, the bill.

1133
01:42:58,634 --> 01:42:59,738
"Run! Run!"

1134
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:02,144
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose!"

1135
01:43:02,267 --> 01:43:04,178
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose, run!"

1136
01:43:04,234 --> 01:43:06,373
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose!"

1137
01:43:06,434 --> 01:43:08,505
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose, run!"

1138
01:43:08,567 --> 01:43:10,638
"The storm's here!"

1139
01:43:10,701 --> 01:43:12,840
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose, run!"

1140
01:43:13,101 --> 01:43:15,604
"Run, run D.K. Bose! D.K. Bose!"

1141
01:43:15,634 --> 01:43:17,739
"The storm's here!"

1142
01:43:19,201 --> 01:43:20,441
Papa..

1143
01:43:21,801 --> 01:43:23,303
It's my birthday.
