Why did the maid have to take off today!

3
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:40,911
Mom! Toothpaste is over.

4
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:42,286
Take it from my bathroom.

5
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:44,286
That herbal one?! I hate that Mom!

6
00:03:44,786 --> 00:03:47,370
If you hate, you go buy! Give.

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,328
There is enough paste for 4 days!

No!

00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,161
Your "no" does not matter

17
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,203
Anya stop this,
I don't have time for your fights today.

18

Eat!

All night chatting on the phone!

She is pushing the limit!

22
00:04:25,828 --> 00:04:28,995

Dilip!

24
00:04:32,203 --> 00:04:33,370
Can you stop it?

25
00:04:34,203 --> 00:04:35,203
It's an instant heater...

26
00:04:35,245 --> 00:04:37,012
Why do you need to
turn it on 4 hours earlier?

27
00:04:37,036 --> 00:04:38,036
What's this?

28
00:04:43,828 --> 00:04:44,870

- Lazy bum can be a useful bum!
- Mom!

00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,370
Baba why did you come out?

33
00:05:01,036 --> 00:05:03,745
I can also serve myself for a day!

34
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:06,786
Sunil! Today is the last day
to pay the electricity bill.

35
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:07,911
Are you mad?

36
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:09,911
Who is going to stand
in that bloody queue?

37
00:05:09,995 --> 00:05:12,203
Sunil, at least help her out today!

38
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:13,786
Please forgive me Tara.

39
00:05:14,203 --> 00:05:16,203
To have raised such a useless son!

40
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:21,078
Ok ok I'll go pay it
But where do I pay?

41
00:05:21,745 --> 00:05:22,828

Sure, ma'am - And Sapna,
Yes, ma'am?

00:06:57,578 --> 00:07:00,453
Why has this rocket been named Fat Boy?

52
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:03,036
Sir, it can lift the
weight of two elephants.

53
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,828
It's a very powerful rocket!

80
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,578

84
00:08:21,953 --> 00:08:23,453
- Hundred percent integrity.
- Great.

Telemetry command...

86
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,304

Good.

00:08:31,786 --> 00:08:35,995

Sir...

104
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:40,161
I misjudged.

105
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:43,786
I thought the alarm was because
of the ambient temperature.

106
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:47,078
Fuel connectors health was 100%, sir!

107
00:11:47,411 --> 00:11:48,661
Congratulations on the failure.

108
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,328
Mr Rakesh, the press is waiting.

109
00:11:54,786 --> 00:11:55,661
Good evening everyone...

110
00:11:55,786 --> 00:12:00,745
I regret to announce that the
launch of GSLV Fatboy was unsuccessful.

The fuel booster turbo-

112
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:04,203
Despite the alarm
why was the launch initiated?

113
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:05,180
<i>Were they any checks in balances.</i>

114
00:12:05,203 --> 00:12:06,578
Who is responsible for this?

115
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,120
I took the call.
The decision was mine.

116
00:12:11,203 --> 00:12:13,745
The country has suffered a huge loss,
and you're eating sweets?

117
00:12:14,661 --> 00:12:17,786
Where is it written on the sweet that it
cannot be eaten during loss?

118
00:12:23,203 --> 00:12:24,411
Thank you, everyone.

119

<i>(HUMMING)

120
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:43,376
The fire cracker rockets
are better than this!

121
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:44,745
At least they fly!

122
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:49,453
India's biggest super rocket
has crashed in the Bay of Bengal.

123
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,429
This government
has spent millions of Rupees...

124
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,078
and made the country a laughing stock.

125
00:12:54,203 --> 00:12:56,620
Some of the best scientists
in the world are Indians...

126
00:12:56,745 --> 00:13:00,328
Unfortunately they work
for NASA or other space agencies...

127
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:06,120
And the duffers remaining here
keep sinking the taxpayers money!

128
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,286
I want an Inquiry into this!

129
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:13,828
Funny!

130
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,286
You find this funny?

131
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,036
Despite the alarm how
could you give the go ahead?

132
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:19,745
What a big mistake!

133
00:13:19,953 --> 00:13:22,036
Because of your mistake...

134
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,161
India's space program
has been set back by 5 years!

135
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:27,495
GSLV Fat Boy was the only rocket...

136
00:13:27,578 --> 00:13:31,870
that could have helped
India plan its 1st manned mission in space.

137
00:13:32,203 --> 00:13:34,245
It could have taken
our satellites to Mars

138
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:37,286
Jupiter, Mercury, like NASA does!

139
00:13:39,995 --> 00:13:43,245
Rakesh, meet Mr Rupert Desai!

140
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:46,495
Met.

141
00:13:47,245 --> 00:13:49,786
Mr Rupert Desai is from NASA.

142
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,828
He arrived yesterday from Houston.

143
00:13:52,036 --> 00:13:54,953
Pioneer 10, 11, Cassini...

144
00:13:55,161 --> 00:14:00,161
He is behind many of America's
successful space missions.

145
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,995
And, he's an Indian!

146
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:06,495
We are thrilled that he
will now work for his own country

147
00:14:06,578 --> 00:14:11,495
and will take charge of
all our flagship space missions.

148
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,536
Including the GSLV Fatboy
relaunch program in Bangalore.

149
00:14:21,286 --> 00:14:25,620
I think you have forgotten
one of my most important achievement...

150
00:14:25,828 --> 00:14:28,495
After spending 23 years in NASA...

151
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,161
I haven't forgotten Hindi!

152
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:37,911
With all due respect,
today NASA is 50 years ahead of ISRO...

153
00:14:38,036 --> 00:14:39,828
It's nothing to be ashamed about.

154
00:14:40,036 --> 00:14:42,245
On the contrary, it's to our advantage.

155
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:46,411
We should borrow from NASA's
knowledge and build on it.

156
00:14:46,911 --> 00:14:47,911
Look at China!

157
00:14:48,203 --> 00:14:51,328
They borrow, build and fly!

158
00:14:52,203 --> 00:14:55,661
Why should we spend our taxpayers'...

159
00:14:55,786 --> 00:14:59,578
hard earned money on these useless...

160
00:14:59,995 --> 00:15:02,953
"Make everything
in India" experiments?

161
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:04,578
Is this a Cow or a Bull?

162
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:11,995
Sorry... What were you saying?

163
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:14,953
Borrow from NASA?

164
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,661
Gentlemen, we are scientists...

165
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:23,161
And there is no science
without experiments.

166
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:25,995
Experiment means to try things out...

167
00:15:26,203 --> 00:15:27,620
And learn.

168
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:33,245
If we don't experiment we have
no right to call ourselves scientists.

169
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,203
What do you think, Mr Rupert?

170
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:37,245
Did NASA become NASA without failing?

171
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:40,620
Weren't Apollo 1 and
Columbia their failures?

172
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:45,203
If we look to NASA to solve all
our problems...

173
00:15:46,911 --> 00:15:47,911
we will be finished!

174
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:51,120
Let's make it in India, for India...

175
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:54,453
We can sir and we will succeed sir!

176
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,953
Rakesh...

177
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:58,953
forget about the past...

178
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:01,578
And focus on the future!

179
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:06,120
I didn't understand sir...

180
00:16:06,495 --> 00:16:09,203
Forget the past, focus on the future!

181
00:16:09,286 --> 00:16:12,578
Thanks for the translation,
but I still didn't get your point sir.

182
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,536
All this GSLV Fatboy and all that...

183
00:16:17,203 --> 00:16:19,078
forget it...

184
00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:21,953
Think 2022.

185
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:26,328
We want you to get India
ready for the Mars mission!

186
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
Mars...

187
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,995
Mars Mission...

188
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,411
I am serious, Rakesh.

189
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:44,995
Sir, the one mission that all
of ISRO knows, will never happen.

190
00:16:46,203 --> 00:16:48,661
Whose idea was it to transfer me
and bury me alive?

191
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:51,495
It's a very good posting.
Mission Director, Grade 4!

192
00:16:53,786 --> 00:16:55,328
Sir, I know it's a government job...

193
00:16:55,745 --> 00:17:00,578
You can't fire me, so you are doing
everything to make me resign quietly.

194
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:05,620
I could resign, join a private
company and earn millions...

195
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:09,495
But the thing is,
I am from this old school.

196
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:14,036
A great man once told me...

197
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:16,911
that my becoming a
Scientist has no meaning

198
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,203
if my science is
of no use to my country.

199
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:27,161
Instead of begging NASA for help,
ask yourselves...

200
00:17:27,245 --> 00:17:31,245
Mr India who's standing with
a bull outside the Space Club...

201
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:36,411
How do we get him in?

202
00:17:36,872 --> 00:17:40,870
<i>(HUMMING) I learnt everything but
I didn't learn how to be smart...</i>

203
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:41,953
Excuse me, gentlemen

204
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:46,036
Mars Mission!!

205
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,370
Rakesh!

206
00:17:49,161 --> 00:17:51,911
Rakesh, I'm sorry It's
strange, sir!

207
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:54,721
All these years I didn't have
the time to think about anything else

208
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:57,620
now I have the time,
but nothing to think about!

209
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,578
My mind is completely empty.

210
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:03,995
You think, I should have
thought of marriage?

211
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,203
Started a family?

212
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:09,076
I don't even have a hobby.

213
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,328
Life has been all about just
science and space!

214
00:18:14,203 --> 00:18:15,203
No problem, sir.

215
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,661
There is Mars... Time will pass.

216
00:18:19,411 --> 00:18:20,411
But thank you sir.

217
00:18:21,203 --> 00:18:22,203
Have a good day.

218
00:18:26,495 --> 00:18:27,203
What the hell, Dilip?

219
00:18:27,245 --> 00:18:28,328
Chill, dad - How dare you?

220
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,762
- What's wrong, I'm just exploring!
- I'm not going to tolerate this, Dilip.

221
00:18:30,786 --> 00:18:31,828
What's wrong?

222
00:18:32,161 --> 00:18:33,161
What's wrong?

223
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,203
This is all your fault!

224
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:36,203
What's this?

225
00:18:36,286 --> 00:18:37,286
A book.

226
00:18:37,411 --> 00:18:38,536
It's the Quran!

227
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,283
The Quran is a book, right?

228
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,388
Is reading a book banned in this house?

229
00:18:42,911 --> 00:18:43,536
Logic!

230
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,370
What logic?

231
00:18:44,578 --> 00:18:45,245
Just look at him.

232
00:18:45,328 --> 00:18:47,828
Look at that beard!
Or can't you see that as well?

233
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:48,911
Sunil enough!

234
00:18:48,995 --> 00:18:50,471
Excuse me, hello... hello... hello...

235
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,455
I have the right
to choose the way I want to live.

236
00:18:53,203 --> 00:18:57,453
You will live the way I want you
to live as long as you are in my house!

237
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:58,745
My house?

238
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:00,637
Ok, we will come to that later...

239
00:19:00,661 --> 00:19:03,578
Dilip why this sudden interest in Islam?

240
00:19:04,495 --> 00:19:05,661
Mom, you won't get it!

241
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:06,328
Try me!

242
00:19:06,453 --> 00:19:08,828
Don't try... Give him a slap!

243
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:10,786
Sunil, leave the room,
I'll speak to him.

244
00:19:10,995 --> 00:19:12,721
Ask him if he has paid the
electricity bill...

245
00:19:12,745 --> 00:19:13,745
- Dilip!
- You...

246
00:19:14,745 --> 00:19:16,745
You go Everyone's over smart!

247
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,529
Mars department has been
given special treatment!

248
00:19:42,321 --> 00:19:47,821
<i>(HUMMING)
Where have we arrived...</i>

249
00:19:48,529 --> 00:19:53,446
<i>(HUMMING)
Walking together for so long...</i>

250
00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:56,446
What a thoughtfully designed office!

251
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,112
It feels like Mars
as soon as you step in!

252
00:20:01,404 --> 00:20:03,654
Is there water on Mars...?

253
00:20:04,487 --> 00:20:05,487
Let's see...

254
00:20:10,612 --> 00:20:11,821
Only a little.

255
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:16,446
There's Oxygen... but less.

256
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:20,779
There's life here!

257
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:24,862
Hello!

258
00:20:25,654 --> 00:20:27,987
Myself Rakesh Dhawan.

259
00:20:29,154 --> 00:20:30,237
Yourself?

260
00:20:31,446 --> 00:20:32,904
Meowars? Nice.

261
00:20:34,154 --> 00:20:35,696
How do you like this planet?

262
00:20:36,071 --> 00:20:37,696
Time moves in slow motion here.

263
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,196
Like...

264
00:20:40,612 --> 00:20:41,779
You know why?

265
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:46,904
Because the Mars orbit around the
Sun is 1.5 times larger than Earth's.

266
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:51,821
Which means your birthday comes
only once in 2 years...

267
00:20:58,612 --> 00:20:59,779
She ran away.

268
00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:03,362
Yes, Tara tell me.

269
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:07,154
I'm sorry, sir.

270
00:21:08,321 --> 00:21:09,904
This is just not fair!

271
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:11,487
I'm sorry, sir.

272
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:15,279
Don't be jealous Tara.

273
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:20,404
Just because you didn't get to work
on the Mars mission, means it's not fair?

274
00:21:21,112 --> 00:21:22,237
You have to earn it!

275
00:21:22,904 --> 00:21:23,904
Earn this!

276
00:21:25,154 --> 00:21:26,821
I can't sleep nowadays.

277
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:28,862
So change your pillow!

278
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:31,321
How can I sleep sir?

279
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:33,571
Because of me...

280
00:21:35,112 --> 00:21:39,446
I can't see one of the world's finest
scientists being destroyed like this!

281
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:41,821
Tara, don't worry about me,
just go and do your job.

282
00:21:42,446 --> 00:21:43,946
What job! How can I...

283
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:47,279
GSLV Fat Boy...
Get it ready by 2022...

284
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:49,237
You have 10-12 years,
enough time...

285
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:52,946
You'll miss my songs for
a few days, that's it!

286
00:21:53,404 --> 00:21:57,279
I will sing at ISRO's annual function...

287
00:21:59,362 --> 00:22:02,362
Take your time!
We have all the time in the world...

288
00:22:03,321 --> 00:22:04,321
Come in.

289
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:06,821
Ma'am.

290
00:22:08,237 --> 00:22:11,154
Ma'am, the gas is running out!

291
00:22:11,404 --> 00:22:13,946
The oil is hot right?
Switch it off.

292
00:22:14,112 --> 00:22:15,112
Fry the bread.

293
00:22:15,362 --> 00:22:18,446
By the time the oil cools down
you can fry all the bread.

294
00:22:18,654 --> 00:22:21,196
The cylinder may come by evening!
Keep the gas off.

295
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,404
The world's most powerful
rocket is getting ready at NASA.

296
00:22:24,696 --> 00:22:25,976
At a budget of Rs. 60 billion...

297
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:30,196
It will carry American satellite
Maven to Mars

298
00:22:30,987 --> 00:22:32,446
Tara, look at your son...

299
00:22:36,404 --> 00:22:38,154
You couldn't save your rocket
from drowning

300
00:22:38,404 --> 00:22:39,904
at least save your son!

301
00:22:40,654 --> 00:22:42,279
He is reading Namaz!

302
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,874
If you wanted to live in
space all your life

303
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,987
why did you have children?

304
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:49,529
Since you've had children
learn to give them space, dad...

305
00:22:50,071 --> 00:22:51,529
I will slap your face okay!

306
00:22:53,321 --> 00:22:55,404
Mom, America is going to Mars?

307
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:57,879
Do you know what Mars is called in Urdu?

308
00:22:58,279 --> 00:22:59,321
Behraam!

309
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:00,654
Shut up!

310
00:23:00,904 --> 00:23:02,987
Ma'am, you're so smart!

311
00:23:03,737 --> 00:23:04,897
All the bread has been fried!

312
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,696
To go to Mars, we have to get past
Earth's gravitational force

313
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:11,505
India does not have a powerful rocket...

314
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,487
that can carry that much fuel.

315
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:16,654
Had GSLV been a success,
it may have been possible...

316
00:23:16,904 --> 00:23:19,237
Mars is around 60 million
kilometres away from Earth,

317
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:23,571
Only American rockets have the
fuel capacity for this mission

318
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:28,654
India has only reached
the Moon so far...

319
00:23:31,071 --> 00:23:33,154
Where are you going?
You're on holiday!

320
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,446
Rakesh sir!

321
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,130
The rocket goes up and
leaves a satellite in space...

322
00:23:43,154 --> 00:23:44,154
Sorry!

323
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:47,487
Sir!

324
00:23:47,904 --> 00:23:51,779
Sir, America has announced
the launch of Maven for Mars.

325
00:23:52,154 --> 00:23:52,987
In 2 years.

326
00:23:53,154 --> 00:23:54,279
2013 take off!

327
00:23:54,362 --> 00:23:55,362
I'm happy for them.

328
00:23:55,446 --> 00:23:56,821
Why can't we do it sir?

329
00:23:58,446 --> 00:24:01,071
Boy! Get ma'am a cup of tea.

330
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,154
And some medicine.

331
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:05,922
Get your health checked,
you don't look well.

332
00:24:05,946 --> 00:24:08,321
Sir, we can go to Mars too!

333
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,529
Sir, I know after my mess-up

334
00:24:12,154 --> 00:24:14,279
it's hard for you to trust me.

335
00:24:14,529 --> 00:24:16,529
But trust me sir, a final time.

336
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:19,737
To the right, is the rocket
that can take us to Mars.

337
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:25,529
This?

338
00:24:25,696 --> 00:24:26,946
My right sir...

339
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:28,862
Oh, sorry.

340
00:24:32,487 --> 00:24:33,487
This?

341
00:24:34,237 --> 00:24:36,779
Boy! Make that tea strong.

342
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:41,487
That is a PSLV rocket!
It's a small boy.

343
00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:42,654
It can only reach the moon.

344
00:24:43,529 --> 00:24:44,654
Sir, I know!

345
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:47,196
Tara, in case you've forgotten...

346
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,862
what you learnt in class 4...

347
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,321
We are here...

348
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:58,529
The moon is right here!
Mars is all the way there.

349
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:01,529
We can go sir... in PSLV!

350
00:25:01,612 --> 00:25:02,946
Let me try again.

351
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:07,362
You can take a Rickshaw to
Mahatma Gandhi Road, not to Meerut!

352
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:11,529
The Rickshaw can go anywhere
if the Rickshaw driver is willing!

353
00:25:12,446 --> 00:25:13,654
Will you go to Mars?

354
00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:17,312
What did you eat this morning?

355
00:25:17,404 --> 00:25:19,696
Fried bread...

356
00:25:41,571 --> 00:25:43,321
Come! Come, come!

357
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:50,737
Bring the table here.

358
00:25:53,321 --> 00:25:55,529
Careful!

359
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:57,654
- The gas is on?
- Yes, sir.

360
00:25:57,821 --> 00:26:00,362
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

361
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:02,529
You can't light a fire inside,
have you gone nuts?!

362
00:26:02,904 --> 00:26:04,672
There's billions of dollars
worth of equipment here

363
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:08,404
you can't bring this in here!
Excuse me, are you the canteen lady?

364
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:09,654
Get her out of here!

365
00:26:09,696 --> 00:26:11,779
She's Tara Shinde,
project director, Mars Mission.

366
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:12,654
What...

367
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,337
- Good morning, sir.
- Project director!?

368
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:16,313
Is this some sort of a joke?

369
00:26:16,376 --> 00:26:17,779
No, it's not a joke.

370
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:18,987
It's a Fried bread!

371
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:20,737
Sir! Can you...?

372
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:24,821
Put this goddamn thing off!

373
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:26,529
What are you guys doing?

374
00:26:27,529 --> 00:26:30,279
Gas is off... Bread is on...

375
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:35,779
When the oil is hot enough to fry the
bread, why make it hotter?

376
00:26:36,196 --> 00:26:38,737
Switch it off, save the
gas and continue frying.

377
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:41,321
When the oil cools,
turn the gas on again.

378
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:44,404
A lot of Indian homes save fuel this way.

379
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:47,904
We want to use this Home Science
technique, to go to Mars!

380
00:26:48,862 --> 00:26:49,862
What?

381
00:26:50,321 --> 00:26:52,446
Have you lost your mind?

382
00:26:52,821 --> 00:26:53,821
Tara, take over.

383
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,696
Yes sir, please take over.

384
00:26:58,321 --> 00:27:00,362
Sir! What's going on?

385
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:04,446
We propose to launch the Mars
satellite in 24 months from now

386
00:27:04,737 --> 00:27:06,112
using the PSLV rocket!

387
00:27:06,237 --> 00:27:07,237
PSLV?

388
00:27:08,196 --> 00:27:09,529
- How?
- Patience.

389
00:27:09,862 --> 00:27:10,862
Patience.

390
00:27:11,112 --> 00:27:13,946
We know that we need
a lot of fuel to go to Mars

391
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,446
and the PSLV has a low fuel capacity.

392
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:17,446
We know...

393
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:20,112
We became scientists before you.
Tara, please continue.

394
00:27:20,204 --> 00:27:22,904
The PSLV can't take
the satellite all the way

395
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:26,112
but can leave it here
in the earth's orbit easily.

396
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:31,071
So, when the satellite reaches
the Perigee...

397
00:27:31,196 --> 00:27:35,862
we will fire the satellite engine with
a little fuel and switch off.

398
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,237
Like we did with the bread.

399
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:40,696
This firing force will increase
the speed of the satellite...

400
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,179
and propel it further away
from Earth into a higher orbit.

401
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,279
When it comes back here...

402
00:27:45,362 --> 00:27:47,821
Little fuel, fire, switch off.

403
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:51,279
Speed will increase and it will go
into an even higher orbit.

404
00:27:51,571 --> 00:27:54,237
We keep doing this till finally...

405
00:27:54,404 --> 00:27:56,196
when the satellite is
at the perigee again

406
00:27:56,487 --> 00:27:57,807
the speed will be so much that...

407
00:27:57,946 --> 00:28:01,112
a final strong firing force...

408
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:04,946
will throw it out of the earth's
gravitational sphere of influence...

409
00:28:05,112 --> 00:28:06,446
like a sling shot.

410
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:10,321
We will use gravitational
force to beat gravity.

411
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:13,529
This way, using less fuel
we can reach Mars.

412
00:28:13,987 --> 00:28:16,237
Not straight, but curved!

413
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,154
Wow!

414
00:28:18,987 --> 00:28:21,112
So this is how you
guys work around here?

415
00:28:21,487 --> 00:28:22,946
On fried bread ideas!

416
00:28:23,321 --> 00:28:25,201
Sir, this is actually
based on Hohmann's theory.

417
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,696
Hohmann's theory is 100 years old!

418
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:30,987
It is obsolete! It's outdated!

419
00:28:31,612 --> 00:28:34,390
This is madness!

420
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:38,737
No Rupert,
it's not as mad as it seems...

421
00:28:39,737 --> 00:28:41,279
There might be an idea here.

422
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:45,362
Now you will ask what's
the hurry to launch...

423
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:50,279
Once in 3 years trajectory from
Earth to Mars is shortest.

424
00:28:50,696 --> 00:28:53,362
If we want to reach Mars on this date

425
00:28:53,446 --> 00:28:56,737
we have to launch 11 months earlier!

426
00:28:56,821 --> 00:29:00,946
If we waste time debating,
Mars will move away

427
00:29:01,112 --> 00:29:03,362
and we will have to wait until 2017!

428
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:05,612
I can't even believe
we're discussing this.

429
00:29:05,946 --> 00:29:10,362
This rocket does not have
the capacity to even carry the weight

430
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:12,255
of the satellite it's
supposed to take with it.

431
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:14,696
Rakesh, that's a point.

432
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:18,654
The load capacity of
the PSLV rocket is very low.

433
00:29:20,404 --> 00:29:26,487
How will it carry such
a complex and heavy satellite?

434
00:29:26,654 --> 00:29:29,112
The kind of satellite
that we need to study Mars!

435
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:32,654
So we can try and make
a lighter satellite!

436
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:36,529
Advanced countries
have failed so many times.

437
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:38,071
America 4 times

438
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:40,529
Russia 8 times...

439
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,612
and you are saying India
will succeed the very first time?

440
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:45,504
Why do you want the
world to laugh at us?

441
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:50,071
Rakesh, your idea is very good,
but Rupert is right.

442
00:29:50,946 --> 00:29:55,112
Before we plan deep space missions,
there's a lot of work we need to do.

443
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:58,112
Our space program is way
behind that of America and Russia!

444
00:29:58,571 --> 00:30:01,112
Let's try in the future. Let's see.

445
00:30:03,112 --> 00:30:05,154
Sir, could I have a
word with you in private?

446
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:17,071
Sir!

447
00:30:17,237 --> 00:30:18,904
What the... Is this a circus?

448
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:20,987
India is behind.

449
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:24,654
And will remain behind
unless we leap forward.

450
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,946
Till now, no country in the world
has reached Mars in the first attempt.

451
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:31,946
Rupert just told us...

452
00:30:32,237 --> 00:30:34,946
Russia 8 times, America 4 times,
China is still trying...

453
00:30:35,321 --> 00:30:36,321
Just think,

454
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:37,446
if India.

455
00:30:37,737 --> 00:30:41,071
In its first attempt manages
to reach Mars, what could happen?

456
00:30:41,321 --> 00:30:42,737
Everyone will lose their minds!

457
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:44,279
What...

458
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:48,321
Sir, today we are
tail-enders for the world.

459
00:30:48,904 --> 00:30:50,654
Tomorrow we can be opening batsmen.

460
00:30:51,529 --> 00:30:54,362
Let's not take singles,
let's hit a sixer.

461
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:57,487
This is great, first it was cooking,
and now it's cricket!

462
00:30:57,737 --> 00:30:59,529
Rakesh, we have a lot of work to do.

463
00:30:59,779 --> 00:31:02,237
Will you please excuse us?

464
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:06,237
Rakesh, it will take 4
or 5 years to make a satellite.

465
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:08,196
How will we launch in 24 months?

466
00:31:08,946 --> 00:31:09,946
I know, sir.

467
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:13,279
We work 9 to 5.

468
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:15,529
8 hours, actually 7 hours,

469
00:31:15,612 --> 00:31:16,987
1 hour for lunch break.

470
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,479
If we do this as a government job,
it will take 4 years.

471
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:24,904
But if we work 15 hours a day
it should be done in 20 months, sir!

472
00:31:27,812 --> 00:31:28,904
Tell me, what do you need?

473
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:30,487
Team, sir! Team!

474
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:32,112
Sir, you can't be serious!

475
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:33,838
Making a satellite takes a
little more than frying bread sir.

476
00:31:33,862 --> 00:31:37,797
We need 6-7 department heads
and at least 400 support crew!

477
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:40,487
We want Mr.Padmanabhan
as head of satellite design.

478
00:31:40,571 --> 00:31:42,196
Mr. Anirudh for Communications.

479
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:45,071
Mr. Kamath for...
You've come with a list?

480
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:47,112
That confident?

481
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:48,526
We don't have any time sir.

482
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,279
Give the list to Mr Rupert.

483
00:31:51,862 --> 00:31:53,112
He will do the needful.

484
00:31:53,362 --> 00:31:55,362
This is subject to budget approval.

485
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:55,946
Yes, sir.

486
00:31:56,154 --> 00:31:58,737
Can you send me
the project report in a week?

487
00:31:58,821 --> 00:32:00,362
You'll get it in 3 days sir!

488
00:32:00,446 --> 00:32:02,404
Sir... I-I can't...
Thank you, sir.

489
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:03,987
Thank you very much.

490
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:05,547
Come, before they change their minds.

491
00:32:05,571 --> 00:32:07,862
Sir, I can't spare Mr. Padmanabhan!

492
00:32:07,987 --> 00:32:09,571
You came fully prepared?

493
00:32:09,654 --> 00:32:11,112
Yes sir! Sorry...

494
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,529
Hello?

495
00:32:13,779 --> 00:32:15,446
I'll call you back...

496
00:32:16,904 --> 00:32:17,904
What happened?

497
00:32:18,383 --> 00:32:20,196
I don't know whether to laugh or cry!

498
00:32:20,446 --> 00:32:22,654
Laugh! Better choice.
What happened?

499
00:32:23,446 --> 00:32:26,487
My son Dilip! He learnt to
play the keyboard just last year.

500
00:32:27,321 --> 00:32:29,571
He's a big fan of A R Rahman...
His name was Dilip too.

501
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:33,154
So this fool thinks if
he becomes a Muslim...

502
00:32:33,404 --> 00:32:35,612
He can be a Hollywood music
director and win an Oscar!

503
00:32:36,112 --> 00:32:37,237
Interesting...

504
00:32:37,529 --> 00:32:42,071
Can't take this religion war
between father and son.

505
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:44,779
Take the day off today. Go home.

506
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:47,821
We only finished 7 hours of work today,
8 are remaining!

507
00:32:51,196 --> 00:32:52,380
Is this the time to come home?

508
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:54,404
I had extra classes, dad.
What do I do?

509
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,529
Weren't you going to resign?

510
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:14,362
Have you eaten?

511
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:16,737
What's the point of this job?

512
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:19,487
Look around, no one's happy!

513
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:20,987
Enough, Sunil.

514
00:33:22,196 --> 00:33:26,112
How will anyone be happy if you stop them
from doing what makes them happy?

515
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,279
Sir they need a team fast.

516
00:33:45,696 --> 00:33:48,154
They want to go to Mars in PSLV!

517
00:33:49,487 --> 00:33:51,112
You got to be kidding me!

518
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:55,821
It's a complete waste of time,
money and energy.

519
00:33:56,446 --> 00:33:57,737
Sir, I don't decide that.

520
00:33:58,404 --> 00:33:59,862
Please give them some people.

521
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:02,071
People with less
experience will do, sir.

522
00:34:07,529 --> 00:34:09,112
Sir, where should I place this monitor?

523
00:34:09,237 --> 00:34:10,279
On my head.

524
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:13,237
Instead of the experts we requested for...

525
00:34:13,737 --> 00:34:16,237
We have been assigned
their juniors!

526
00:34:16,571 --> 00:34:17,987
How can they do this?

527
00:34:18,862 --> 00:34:20,862
We need people with
the maximum experience!

528
00:34:21,446 --> 00:34:24,279
Seems like Mr. Rupert Desai
doesn't want this mission to succeed!

529
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:25,904
Varsha Chillai!

530
00:34:25,987 --> 00:34:27,529
Not Chillai, sir. Pillai!

531
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:30,821
I've packed your favourite today...
potato paratha.

532
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:32,237
Give me plain bread...

533
00:34:34,779 --> 00:34:36,612
I already look like a potato!

534
00:34:36,904 --> 00:34:41,362
Good choice to design a
lightweight satellite!

535
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:46,571
I know, I know...
I have no right to talk about weight!

536
00:34:51,612 --> 00:34:56,212
Have you no shame doing
all this in the living room?

537
00:34:56,274 --> 00:35:00,237
Mom, because you have
taken over our room...

538
00:35:00,612 --> 00:35:04,987
This is now our bedroom.

539
00:35:09,279 --> 00:35:10,279
Where do I keep this?

540
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:12,171
In the morning there was a table here...

541
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:13,529
where has it gone?

542
00:35:19,737 --> 00:35:22,529
At our place a table is a table
and a sofa is a sofa...

543
00:35:23,196 --> 00:35:24,904
Don't start your nonsense.

544
00:35:25,779 --> 00:35:29,737
Thanks to my wife we are able to
fit so much into this small house...

545
00:35:30,237 --> 00:35:31,237
including you!

546
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:35,196
She can fit everything anywhere...

547
00:35:35,446 --> 00:35:37,571
Except a child inside her!

548
00:35:45,279 --> 00:35:46,946
When will I see your obituary?

549
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:02,654
Navigation and Communication...
Kritika Agarwal!

550
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:06,362
Ma'am, hands always
on the 10 and 2 positions!

551
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:08,362
- Hands on the wheel!
- 10! 10!

552
00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:09,321
10!

553
00:36:09,362 --> 00:36:10,362
10 and 2 positions!

554
00:36:10,904 --> 00:36:11,987
Okay, ready!

555
00:36:12,529 --> 00:36:13,862
She has no mission experience.

556
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:15,336
She's inexperienced, sir.

557
00:36:15,529 --> 00:36:17,696
Ma'am, don't lean forward.
Sit back!

558
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,654
- How will I see...
- Back, back!

559
00:36:20,362 --> 00:36:21,571
Now drive straight ahead.

560
00:36:21,821 --> 00:36:22,821
Okay!

561
00:36:23,237 --> 00:36:27,071
That's the accelerator, press
the clutch and put it into third gear.

562
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:28,571
Okay!

563
00:36:28,654 --> 00:36:30,279
Look ahead!

564
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:31,696
I am!

565
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:33,472
Don't take your eyes off the road.

566
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:34,854
Now put it into fourth gear...

567
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:36,529
- Fourth gear?
- Yes.

568
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:37,904
Go ahead...

569
00:36:44,886 --> 00:36:46,446
Sorry...

570
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:53,328
Neha. S.

571
00:36:54,445 --> 00:36:55,446
Where are you from?

572
00:36:55,779 --> 00:36:58,446
Lucknow No cooking
meat in the house.

573
00:36:58,696 --> 00:36:59,737
The gates close at 10.

574
00:36:59,821 --> 00:37:03,696
No problem, sir.
I saw the details online, I know.

575
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:06,487
No boyfriends.

576
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:07,691
That problem won't be there.

577
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:10,446
Twenty thousand rent.
Hundred thousand deposit.

578
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:12,196
Will you take a Cheque?

579
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:13,446
Yes. Don't cross it.

580
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:18,237
Neha ji, give me your full name
and permanent address

581
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:19,196
and I'll have the agreement made.

582
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:19,946
Neha Siddiqui.

583
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,112
Number 73, Gomti Nagar Lucknow...
Siddiqui?

584
00:37:22,529 --> 00:37:23,112
Yes.

585
00:37:23,237 --> 00:37:24,237
Are you a Muslim?

586
00:37:24,321 --> 00:37:25,321
Yes.

587
00:37:26,529 --> 00:37:29,404
Today is Tuesday...

588
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:30,946
Not a good day...

589
00:37:31,696 --> 00:37:33,529
We'll fix the date
over the phone tomorrow.

590
00:37:33,987 --> 00:37:36,612
I don't need the cheque today!

591
00:37:43,112 --> 00:37:44,112
She looks nice!

592
00:37:44,612 --> 00:37:45,612
Next!

593
00:37:47,821 --> 00:37:48,904
Eka Gandhi.

594
00:37:49,154 --> 00:37:49,862
She also...!

595
00:37:49,946 --> 00:37:51,321
Propulsion Engineer.

596
00:38:05,112 --> 00:38:06,112
Get up and leave

597
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:07,571
the maid will be here soon.

598
00:38:07,946 --> 00:38:10,487
She'll go crazy if she sees
a new face again!

599
00:38:21,529 --> 00:38:24,071
Power cut again!
This country sucks!

600
00:38:26,877 --> 00:38:28,321
What's the hurry?

601
00:38:28,529 --> 00:38:30,089
It's a government job,
where will it go?

602
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:32,237
I'm working here for
the 3 year experience.

603
00:38:32,321 --> 00:38:34,279
After that I'm flying off to NASA!

604
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:36,654
Have you ever worn a saree?

605
00:38:37,779 --> 00:38:38,987
You will look gorgeous.

606
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:41,446
You're a typical man of this country...

607
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:44,404
Want a woman imprisoned
in a saree all her life!

608
00:38:44,987 --> 00:38:46,112
Can you get out now, please?

609
00:38:46,446 --> 00:38:47,696
Can you lend me 5000 bucks?

610
00:38:50,571 --> 00:38:51,611
Is that your nightly rate?

611
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,591
Looks like an All women's club!

612
00:38:58,747 --> 00:38:59,904
Excuse me?

613
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:01,696
No just...

614
00:39:01,779 --> 00:39:04,404
if there was another man to talk to...

615
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:07,487
Oh, here he is! Parmeshwar Joshi...

616
00:39:07,529 --> 00:39:10,321
Your horoscope
is pretty inauspicious.

617
00:39:10,821 --> 00:39:12,529
The planets are not
aligned in your favour.

618
00:39:12,654 --> 00:39:14,362
Especially Mars.

619
00:39:14,779 --> 00:39:16,362
Saturn is also weighing
down on you.

620
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:21,654
Every girl I meet gets married
to someone else.

621
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:23,654
Any solution for that?

622
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:27,154
There is only one solution...

623
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:29,321
You'll have to be careful of Mars.

624
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:32,071
Stay far away from Mars...

625
00:39:32,321 --> 00:39:35,404
Pray to the 9 Gods
Here's my card.

626
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:39,904
One more! Ananth Iyengar...

627
00:39:46,487 --> 00:39:48,487
- Did Tarun call?
- No.

628
00:39:49,071 --> 00:39:53,529
I thought I will retire early and live
with my son in San Francisco.

629
00:39:54,237 --> 00:40:00,741
And spend the rest of my life
in a civilised country...

630
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:04,362
But instead...

631
00:40:08,075 --> 00:40:10,808
Isn't he a bit young for this mission?

632
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:14,171
Sir this is impossible!

633
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,380
We need an experienced team!
All these people are...

634
00:40:17,505 --> 00:40:22,296
Who has the experience of going
to Mars in ISRO, including you and me?

635
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:22,921
But sir...

636
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:26,755
In the 1983 World Cup final,
West Indies had Vivian Richards,

637
00:40:27,255 --> 00:40:30,713
Gordon Greenidge,
Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding,

638
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:35,963
Andy Roberts, Joel Garner,
Jefferey Dujon, Clive Lloyd...

639
00:40:36,005 --> 00:40:37,505
And we had?

640
00:40:37,796 --> 00:40:41,671
Kapil Dev could have also told
the selectors, 'this is impossible...

641
00:40:42,796 --> 00:40:47,880
I want Allan Border, Dennis Lillee,
Ian Botham, Imran Khan...'

642
00:40:48,713 --> 00:40:50,963
The whole world was
sure that the Indian team...

643
00:40:51,046 --> 00:40:53,546
had no chance of winning the World Cup!

644
00:40:53,963 --> 00:40:57,171
So we had no pressure
to win or fear of losing.

645
00:40:57,796 --> 00:40:59,838
We just went and played our game.

646
00:41:00,796 --> 00:41:01,796
And we won!

647
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,570
Same, same.

648
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:06,088
Sports and science.

649
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,296
Sarcasm?

650
00:41:07,671 --> 00:41:09,296
- Sarcasm!
- Mars department?

651
00:41:09,921 --> 00:41:11,880
We think so... Come!

652
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,630
Good morning sir...

653
00:41:14,796 --> 00:41:17,213
Sorry, I had to
go to the Temple today...

654
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:19,963
Temple offering...

655
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:24,671
You go to the temple everyday...

656
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:26,505
Or you went because it's your first day?

657
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,713
No sir...

658
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:30,005
to pray this would be my last day!

659
00:41:30,296 --> 00:41:34,130
I'm sorry sir, but I can't work here!

660
00:41:35,046 --> 00:41:36,046
Don't you like Tara?

661
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,963
No, no! I'm a big fan of both of you...

662
00:41:39,255 --> 00:41:41,046
how shall I say this...?

663
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:43,171
Try from your mouth...
It's a good option.

664
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,171
I'm a virgin sir.

665
00:41:49,588 --> 00:41:50,981
I haven't been able to get married.

666
00:41:51,005 --> 00:41:53,963
Even the women in Bangkok
look at me and run away, sir...

667
00:41:54,171 --> 00:41:55,213
What?

668
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,171
Nothing, boys talk...

669
00:41:57,505 --> 00:41:59,963
Mars is hovering over my head, sir.

670
00:42:00,296 --> 00:42:04,255
Priest told me to stay away from Mars

671
00:42:04,755 --> 00:42:07,255
and here we are trying
to get close to it...

672
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:08,637
Sir.

673
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:12,046
Eka Gandhi Propulsion Department.

674
00:42:24,296 --> 00:42:25,296
Sir...

675
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,755
Good morning!

676
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,630
Kritika Agarwal.

677
00:42:36,296 --> 00:42:38,255
By the way, office begins at 9 am...

678
00:42:50,421 --> 00:42:52,088
- Excuse me?
- Please come in!

679
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:53,630
Neha?

680
00:42:54,088 --> 00:42:55,088
Here...

681
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:57,546
Project details,
you can go through them.

682
00:43:00,046 --> 00:43:02,796
- Sorry ma'am, Varsha?
- Yes

683
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:10,880
Bangalore is in ruins!

684
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:13,338
No traffic management, nothing.

685
00:43:13,588 --> 00:43:16,338
In 1976 when I...

686
00:43:16,671 --> 00:43:19,880
Please sit here...
Please come, sir.

687
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
What are you doing?

688
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,380
Trying to get from Earth to Mars...

689
00:43:57,505 --> 00:43:58,755
How far is it from Earth?

690
00:44:00,046 --> 00:44:01,713
Almost 60 million kilometers.

691
00:44:02,088 --> 00:44:03,088
What!

692
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:06,546
A rocket can get us there in 11 months.

693
00:44:07,255 --> 00:44:09,005
Oh, so you're making a rocket!

694
00:44:09,338 --> 00:44:10,338
Nope.

695
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:11,630
There is a rocket.

696
00:44:12,421 --> 00:44:13,421
PSLV.

697
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,796
PSLV... Same rocket took us to
the moon 2 years ago, right?

698
00:44:18,505 --> 00:44:20,255
Not bad, you remember!

699
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:25,296
Yes, now we want to send a
satellite to orbit Mars.

700
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:27,046
So what's the problem?

701
00:44:27,546 --> 00:44:28,546
Put it in and send it!

702
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,171
Wish it were that easy!

703
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,671
The moon is easier.

704
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,338
It lies within the earth's
gravitational force...

705
00:44:37,963 --> 00:44:40,713
To get to Mars we have
to get through this force.

706
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,005
Give that to me.

707
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,963
Go stand in the corner

708
00:44:53,255 --> 00:44:54,921
I'm the Earth. And you?

709
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:56,130
Your son!

710
00:44:57,505 --> 00:45:00,005
- You are my Mars! Okay?
- Okay.

711
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:01,296
Yo-yo is satellite.

712
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,546
- Okay?
- Okay!

713
00:45:02,671 --> 00:45:05,380
The PSLV can only take
the satellite till here.

714
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:07,963
But the earth's gravity
will not let the satellite go.

715
00:45:08,171 --> 00:45:09,691
It will rotate it like this, in orbit.

716
00:45:09,755 --> 00:45:10,963
Mom careful, it'll break!

717
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:12,255
That's what we want!

718
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:16,671
Increase the force each time...

719
00:45:17,088 --> 00:45:19,046
until it breaks away from it!

720
00:45:21,088 --> 00:45:22,421
Well done!

721
00:45:24,338 --> 00:45:26,421
If Mars catches our
satellite the same way...

722
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:28,130
then job done!

723
00:45:28,255 --> 00:45:29,296
How will Mars catch it?

724
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:31,296
Just like Earth,
Mars has gravity too.

725
00:45:31,713 --> 00:45:34,296
It will catch the satellite
and make it rotate around it.

726
00:45:34,838 --> 00:45:39,213
And the satellite will
tell us if there is water...

727
00:45:39,338 --> 00:45:42,505
minerals, chances of life etc on Mars.

728
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:44,353
The country will benefit
hugely from this!

729
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,380
Wow what a technique!

730
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:48,410
Has anyone gone this way before?

731
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,005
That's the joy!

732
00:45:50,296 --> 00:45:52,046
To be first. To be original!

733
00:45:52,796 --> 00:45:55,630
You should be inspired by others,
learn from them...

734
00:45:56,046 --> 00:45:58,505
but find your own path.

735
00:45:59,671 --> 00:46:02,505
Take your field,
look at A R Rahman.

736
00:46:03,671 --> 00:46:06,505
Original icon!
He has found his own path!

737
00:46:10,755 --> 00:46:14,213
In order to reach Mars,
we need 1500 kgs of fuel.

738
00:46:14,588 --> 00:46:16,250
And you're saying the total
weight of the satellite...

739
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,005
should not exceed 1350 kgs!

740
00:46:18,188 --> 00:46:19,588
How?

741
00:46:19,688 --> 00:46:20,963
We have to reduce the fuel.

742
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,963
The fuel weight can't exceed this.

743
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:32,213
Let's find a way.

744
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:34,630
What way?

745
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:37,005
With so little fuel it won't even
cross Bangladesh!

746
00:46:38,255 --> 00:46:39,796
They're messing with Mars!

747
00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:41,713
Who knows what will happen...

748
00:46:42,796 --> 00:46:43,921
Let's run away from here.

749
00:46:46,588 --> 00:46:47,588
Sir!

750
00:46:48,546 --> 00:46:51,005
We have to reach Mars before you retire.

751
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:53,963
You need young blood for a tough
mission like this, sir!

752
00:46:54,505 --> 00:46:57,213
- My BP's low...
- What's your age?

753
00:46:57,671 --> 00:46:58,671
45?

754
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,505
59!

755
00:47:00,921 --> 00:47:02,005
What are you saying?

756
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,671
59?

757
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:05,671
You don't look a day over 45!

758
00:47:05,963 --> 00:47:08,963
You're glowing! What's your secret?

759
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:12,005
It's because of my strict diet.

760
00:47:12,088 --> 00:47:14,088
Slow down! You'll tire me.

761
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:16,421
Sir, if anything goes
wrong with the satellite...

762
00:47:16,546 --> 00:47:19,713
it'll take 24 minutes
for our command to reach it.

763
00:47:19,773 --> 00:47:21,505
By then, the damage will be done.

764
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:23,796
The satellite will
just have to repair itself

765
00:47:23,921 --> 00:47:28,046
and we've never attempted
such complex programming before.

766
00:47:28,148 --> 00:47:29,213
Isn't that exciting?

767
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:30,630
It'll be our first time!

768
00:47:31,255 --> 00:47:32,338
Let's do it.

769
00:47:34,588 --> 00:47:35,588
Kritika!

770
00:47:36,213 --> 00:47:40,838
Ma'am only US and Russia have
heavy duty satellite antennas...

771
00:47:40,921 --> 00:47:43,713
for communication between Mars and us.

772
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:47,338
Since we're short on
time, shall I order them?

773
00:47:48,171 --> 00:47:50,630
At home, do you order food from
outside everyday?

774
00:47:51,713 --> 00:47:55,005
If we order everything from outside
how will it fit in our budget?

775
00:47:56,046 --> 00:47:57,713
Here, follow this.

776
00:47:58,755 --> 00:48:03,213
To study Mars we need infrared cameras,
ultra-violet cameras, sensors, everything!

777
00:48:03,421 --> 00:48:05,755
You are only giving me
enough room for a lens.

778
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,046
How will I fit everything in?

779
00:48:07,213 --> 00:48:10,963
A person who can fit a lot
of science into a small space is called...

780
00:48:11,546 --> 00:48:13,338
a space scientist!

781
00:48:13,713 --> 00:48:15,213
Think, innovate!

782
00:48:15,671 --> 00:48:17,005
Yes, I've had the medicine

783
00:48:17,588 --> 00:48:18,880
I'll be back by 5.

784
00:48:18,963 --> 00:48:20,171
Yes, tell me.

785
00:48:21,713 --> 00:48:22,713
Busy?

786
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:27,713
To fit in the PSLV, if we have make
the satellite lightweight...

787
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,380
we will have to
reduce its size...

788
00:48:31,046 --> 00:48:35,171
How will we fit cameras, sensors,
transponders...?

789
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:38,088
We need all the instruments, ma'am.

790
00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:42,046
We are not going to Mars just
to circle around it...

791
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,320
We need to do a detailed
study of it!

792
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:48,046
I know why we are
going to Mars Thank you.

793
00:48:49,546 --> 00:48:51,963
If everything could fit easily...

794
00:48:52,588 --> 00:48:54,338
why do we need
a Satellite designer?

795
00:48:55,088 --> 00:48:56,380
Don't think small.

796
00:48:56,796 --> 00:48:57,963
Make things small.

797
00:48:58,421 --> 00:48:59,421
Miniaturize!

798
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,338
We only have 8 billion
to make this mission happen

799
00:49:03,505 --> 00:49:05,421
so we need to start with basics.

800
00:49:05,671 --> 00:49:08,880
From the...
Rakesh... Please stay seated!

801
00:49:09,171 --> 00:49:11,505
I've just spoken to the minister.

802
00:49:11,671 --> 00:49:13,421
We may have to postpone this mission

803
00:49:13,625 --> 00:49:14,921
I'm sorry.

804
00:49:15,588 --> 00:49:16,338
I don't understand...

805
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:21,421
The government is very
happy with our Mars Mission.

806
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:24,505
But they aren't willing
to give us any extra money.

807
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:30,963
They don't have a problem if
we do this within ISRO's yearly budget.

808
00:49:31,046 --> 00:49:33,796
How can I take out Rs. 8 billion...

809
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,088
from an on going project and give
it to the Mars Mission?

810
00:49:38,088 --> 00:49:41,296
Have we ever got an extra penny
for any of ISRO's missions?

811
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,255
I am sorry.

812
00:49:44,368 --> 00:49:48,255
Sir, NASA's Maven has
a budget of Rs. 60 billion...

813
00:49:48,671 --> 00:49:50,713
we have only asked for Rs. 8 billion...

814
00:49:50,796 --> 00:49:52,796
Look at the difference sir,
there is no comparison!

815
00:49:53,088 --> 00:49:57,005
For 1.2 billion people it's
just a cost of a cup of tea.

816
00:49:57,380 --> 00:49:58,963
We have to do it for our country sir!

817
00:49:59,671 --> 00:50:01,546
Let's try it again!

818
00:50:01,755 --> 00:50:05,587
I understand... trust me,
I have tried my best.

819
00:50:06,255 --> 00:50:07,296
I'm sorry!

820
00:50:24,963 --> 00:50:26,255
Bad luck sir!

821
00:50:29,213 --> 00:50:31,046
I was actually very
excited for it, ma'am.

822
00:50:32,088 --> 00:50:33,213
Sorry...

823
00:50:35,046 --> 00:50:37,880
If we were in NASA, budget would
have never been a problem.

824
00:50:39,963 --> 00:50:40,963
Sir.

825
00:50:41,338 --> 00:50:43,630
Sorry, sir. Sorry, ma'am...

826
00:50:44,005 --> 00:50:45,963
It was a really
interesting project, sir.

827
00:50:46,671 --> 00:50:47,671
Sorry...

828
00:50:50,546 --> 00:50:53,713
Both of you should get
your horoscopes checked.

829
00:51:01,588 --> 00:51:04,088
In 1983 if Kapil Dev had been told.

830
00:51:04,171 --> 00:51:06,963
"Sorry, there's no money
for flight tickets to London..."

831
00:51:08,421 --> 00:51:10,088
how would he have
won the world cup?

832
00:51:12,338 --> 00:51:13,338
I can't believe this!

833
00:51:22,171 --> 00:51:24,505
The new Sufiyaana. Sufi!

834
00:51:24,755 --> 00:51:26,546
Your son is playing in a Sufi group!

835
00:51:27,005 --> 00:51:29,963
Mom, it's Priya's birthday today.
I'll be late.

836
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:31,046
What?

837
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,963
I'm thinking of resigning...
What? Why?

838
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,130
Really?

839
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:36,671
You were right, Sunil.

840
00:51:37,213 --> 00:51:39,213
Maybe I just got obsessed with my job.

841
00:51:40,963 --> 00:51:41,963
Shall we go to Ooty?

842
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,380
Ooty?

843
00:51:43,796 --> 00:51:45,796
Yes! Let's go.

844
00:51:45,963 --> 00:51:47,713
What are you all planning without me?

845
00:51:48,005 --> 00:51:49,005
Dad, we're going to Ooty!

846
00:51:49,088 --> 00:51:50,671
I'll have to think about it!

847
00:51:50,838 --> 00:51:52,088
From today you will listen...

848
00:51:52,296 --> 00:51:53,505
You and that idiot!

849
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:57,281
Wonder if he is writing
from left to right or right to left!

850
00:51:57,713 --> 00:51:59,546
Dad, Urdu is the language of poets!

851
00:51:59,963 --> 00:52:01,546
- Mannerless!
- Ok guys! Dilip,

852
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:03,130
we're all going to Ooty...

853
00:52:03,963 --> 00:52:06,088
- Ooty?
- Yes, Ooty!

854
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:07,713
Mom, what about Mars?

855
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:10,213
Your mother is quitting her job!

856
00:52:10,546 --> 00:52:12,255
What! Mom...

857
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,588
don't listen to this fellow!

858
00:52:14,796 --> 00:52:16,963
Don't leave your job! You'll die!

859
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:20,671
If not Mars there's Mercury,
Jupiter, Pluto...

860
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,963
I'll give you some ideas.

861
00:52:22,546 --> 00:52:23,796
I know Space is your life!

862
00:52:23,963 --> 00:52:26,046
And anyway, I can't
come to Ooty and all...

863
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,963
- Why?
- I have to finish my song.

864
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,505
Qawwali, huh?

865
00:52:29,921 --> 00:52:31,046
Pack your bloody bags!

866
00:52:31,588 --> 00:52:33,046
I'd like to thank you all...

867
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:36,046
Sorry, to barge in sir Oh
god, not him.

868
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:37,130
Rakesh!

869
00:52:37,671 --> 00:52:38,713
Sir, what is this?

870
00:52:39,171 --> 00:52:40,255
Can I just borrow this?

871
00:52:40,671 --> 00:52:41,671
Thank you.

872
00:52:44,255 --> 00:52:48,921
China's first attempt at
going to Mars is unsuccessful.

873
00:52:48,963 --> 00:52:52,171
With the help of a rocket from Russia,

874
00:52:52,255 --> 00:52:54,055
China wanted to send
its satellite into space.

875
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:56,630
But the Russian rocket
gave China a shock

876
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,213
and before it could cross
the Earth's orbit, it exploded.

877
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:01,005
They could not cross the Van Allen belt!

878
00:53:01,421 --> 00:53:03,546
China wanted to be first
in Asia to go to Mars!

879
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:06,880
The Chinese must have
used their "noodle science"

880
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:09,171
as we have our "poori science"!

881
00:53:10,505 --> 00:53:13,296
Sir...
China went to the moon before us.

882
00:53:13,796 --> 00:53:15,796
But this is our chance
to reach Mars before them!

883
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,213
Let's not wait sir...

884
00:53:17,296 --> 00:53:18,456
But we don't have the budget!

885
00:53:18,505 --> 00:53:19,713
We have the budget sir!

886
00:53:20,796 --> 00:53:21,838
We have the budget.

887
00:53:24,588 --> 00:53:28,880
We were also going to use this same PHOBOS
Russian rocket for Chandrayan 2 mission

888
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:31,171
and now we all know.

889
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:32,671
Phobos is a failure

890
00:53:33,046 --> 00:53:35,327
which means we will put our
Russian collaboration on hold!

891
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:38,130
Assume we stop Chandrayan 2 for now...

892
00:53:38,213 --> 00:53:41,755
Woah! We can't cancel
this program now!

893
00:53:42,505 --> 00:53:43,963
We're almost halfway there.

894
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,421
I suggest we talk to NASA,
let's bring NASA in.

895
00:53:47,546 --> 00:53:52,046
It may take at least 2 years for
a new collaboration with anybody else.

896
00:53:52,546 --> 00:53:56,921
So, Rakesh, assume
we postpone Chandrayaan 2

897
00:53:56,963 --> 00:54:01,755
but that mission has only
Rs. 4 billion remaining

898
00:54:01,963 --> 00:54:03,671
and you need Rs. 8 billion...

899
00:54:04,213 --> 00:54:06,630
Where will we get the money?
It's impossible.

900
00:54:08,671 --> 00:54:09,921
Can I use it again?

901
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,005
What is going on?

902
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,255
Did we have the money
to make our first rocket?

903
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:18,046
We made it like this.

904
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:21,255
Do you know who these two are?

905
00:54:23,588 --> 00:54:25,963
This is Abdul Kalamji!
Our former president.

906
00:54:26,546 --> 00:54:28,588
And do you know who is next to him?

907
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:31,088
It's not that impossible.

908
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:34,296
There he is, our director!

909
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:37,272
If we hadn't made the
rocket this way, that day...

910
00:54:37,296 --> 00:54:39,939
Because there was no money for a truck,
If they hadn't carried it piece by piece

911
00:54:39,963 --> 00:54:42,338
on cycles and bullock carts...

912
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:46,213
assembled it in an old
church in Kerala...

913
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:49,713
and lauched India's first rocket
successfully from a nearby field...

914
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:51,755
would ISRO exist today?

915
00:54:52,338 --> 00:54:53,546
Would we be here?

916
00:54:54,796 --> 00:54:55,796
Impossible!

917
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,713
Sir, I'm not sure how we will do it
but we will do it...

918
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:02,921
We have to do it sir.

919
00:55:03,963 --> 00:55:08,005
For me ISRO has not been Indian
Space Research Organisation...

920
00:55:08,088 --> 00:55:11,963
it has always been Impossible
Space Research Organisation!

921
00:55:12,255 --> 00:55:14,213
A dream that can be a reality!

922
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:16,213
Oh my god!

923
00:55:17,338 --> 00:55:20,338
If only dreams and emotions
could propel us to another planet!

924
00:55:22,421 --> 00:55:25,630
Sir, we need to think
this through very carefully.

925
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:28,588
Let's not rush in, or we will fail!

926
00:55:28,963 --> 00:55:30,630
What if we succeed?

927
00:55:32,213 --> 00:55:33,546
Sir, with all due respect,

928
00:55:34,588 --> 00:55:36,963
I have to tell you that
the way things stand right now

929
00:55:38,713 --> 00:55:42,671
the chances of this mission
succeeding are less than 1%.

930
00:55:43,005 --> 00:55:44,421
Can anyone challenge that?

931
00:55:45,505 --> 00:55:46,546
I rest my case.

932
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,963
Hello, Kalam sir, how are you Me?
Sir.

933
00:55:58,338 --> 00:56:01,421
Some big Imported people are saying...

934
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:05,546
The chances of the Mars Mission
succeeding are not even 1%.

935
00:56:09,046 --> 00:56:12,963
Oh really, sir? Okay, sir...

936
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:14,650
Sir, wait a minute for 5 minutes, sir.

937
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:16,046
Yes, sir!

938
00:56:17,546 --> 00:56:21,546
Sir, Abdul Kalam sir - you know,
ex ISRO Chairman, ex Country Chairman.

939
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,296
He is challenging you.

940
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:27,921
He's saying "imported man, imported man".

941
00:56:28,546 --> 00:56:34,088
If there's even a 0.000001% chance
we can make it to Mars before China

942
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:37,880
shut your mouth and
let it happen.

943
00:56:39,296 --> 00:56:40,296
Really, sir?

944
00:56:40,713 --> 00:56:42,963
That also I should say?

945
00:56:43,171 --> 00:56:47,796
He's also saying "Dream
is not what you see in sleep..."

946
00:56:48,005 --> 00:56:51,046
Dream is something which
doesn't let you sleep!"

947
00:56:52,255 --> 00:56:53,880
Sir, I told him!

948
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:57,505
Sir, will you talk to your old friend?

949
00:56:59,296 --> 00:57:01,505
I understand, sir. You're busy!

950
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:03,338
Thank you, sir!

951
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,838
What's so funny?
It's a very bad joke!

952
00:57:07,921 --> 00:57:13,338
Mr Rupert, every scientific achievement
was once considered a joke!

953
00:57:14,796 --> 00:57:19,213
If we tell the government that we are
postponing Chandrayaan 2...

954
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:24,921
and not spending the remaining
Rs. 4 billion this financial year...

955
00:57:24,963 --> 00:57:26,921
they will take the money back!

956
00:57:28,296 --> 00:57:29,296
Rakesh - Sir!

957
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,338
We have a chance to create history.

958
00:57:32,213 --> 00:57:35,755
If you can pull it off in Rs. 4 billion,
let's do it!

959
00:57:36,796 --> 00:57:37,796
Thank you, sir!

960
00:57:37,963 --> 00:57:40,588
Mr Padmanabhan, Mr Anirudhh...

961
00:57:40,713 --> 00:57:45,921
Dr Kamath, I request you to come
forward and give this your time.

962
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:49,255
Sir! These are my best guys,
I can't spare them!

963
00:57:49,338 --> 00:57:50,963
- Calm down, parrot!
- What?

964
00:57:51,088 --> 00:57:52,630
Sorry, calm down Rupert.

965
00:57:53,255 --> 00:57:57,005
That core team, those priceless
gems that you handpicked for me

966
00:57:57,421 --> 00:57:59,755
send them back to me.

967
00:58:00,171 --> 00:58:01,171
All the best!

968
00:58:01,255 --> 00:58:03,088
Thank you very much!

969
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:37,228
Message all you want now...
there's no network in Ooty!

970
00:58:38,353 --> 00:58:39,603
Family time!

971
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:43,812
Hello.

972
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:45,937
Yes sir?

973
00:58:47,562 --> 00:58:48,562
Okay...

974
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:51,353
Really?

975
00:58:52,687 --> 00:58:54,645
Rs. 4 billion... How?

976
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:05,145
I think we have to cancel Ooty...
What!

977
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:06,853
Yes! Inshallah!

978
00:59:07,062 --> 00:59:08,187
Shut up!

979
00:59:09,353 --> 00:59:12,395
Your IVF is successful.
Congratulations...

980
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:14,270
You're going to be a mother!

981
00:59:16,978 --> 00:59:20,187
Call your mother. She will be
happier than us.

982
00:59:20,937 --> 00:59:22,687
Let's not tell her...

983
00:59:22,853 --> 00:59:25,478
She'll think we did this
because of her.

984
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:26,978
Vivek, don't be silly.

985
00:59:27,395 --> 00:59:30,228
We made the decision because
the Mars Mission got cancelled!

986
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,520
Else whatever her taunts...

987
00:59:32,687 --> 00:59:34,645
We would never have
the time for a baby.

988
00:59:37,312 --> 00:59:38,353
Rakesh sir...

989
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:46,770
Ma'am, why are you endangering
so many lives on the road?

990
00:59:47,353 --> 00:59:50,020
Bangalore commute is easy...

991
00:59:50,187 --> 00:59:52,562
there are auto rickshaws,
the metro...

992
00:59:52,728 --> 00:59:54,395
even the bus service has improved!

993
00:59:54,687 --> 00:59:56,437
But the men haven't improved.

994
00:59:57,478 --> 00:59:59,353
I'm learning how to
drive for self defense.

995
00:59:59,437 --> 01:00:02,520
Learn Karate or Kung Fu instead.

996
01:00:05,353 --> 01:00:06,687
No phones while driving!

997
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,520
Mrs Kritika Agarwal?

998
01:00:11,687 --> 01:00:12,312
Hello?

999
01:00:12,353 --> 01:00:13,395
Sorry to inform you...

1000
01:00:13,937 --> 01:00:16,603
Lieutenant Rishi Agarwal has been
injured in cross border firing.

1001
01:00:18,562 --> 01:00:20,762
I am happy to inform you that
he is out of danger now...

1002
01:00:22,228 --> 01:00:23,496
Once his condition stabilizes...

1003
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,680
We will shift him to the Command
Hospital in Bangalore!

1004
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,520
You're leaving us?

1005
01:00:49,585 --> 01:00:51,353
Excuse me? How dare you peep?

1006
01:00:51,728 --> 01:00:54,478
You've been after me since
that Mars mission. So cheap!

1007
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:59,353
Sitting in ISRO and applying to join
NASA is not cheap?

1008
01:01:00,478 --> 01:01:01,812
Eka Gandhi!

1009
01:01:02,353 --> 01:01:05,020
Name is 'Gandhi' and you want to
Quit India?

1010
01:01:07,145 --> 01:01:09,395
Was your dad a cheap
dialogue writer?

1011
01:01:13,728 --> 01:01:14,728
Hello?

1012
01:01:16,978 --> 01:01:17,978
Hello?

1013
01:01:18,353 --> 01:01:20,228
Ok ma'am... Okay!

1014
01:01:24,228 --> 01:01:25,270
What!

1015
01:01:25,812 --> 01:01:28,353
Last week you said the
house was available.

1016
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,727
What's the problem?

1017
01:01:31,103 --> 01:01:32,687
That I'm a divorcee or my surname?

1018
01:01:33,937 --> 01:01:37,853
He cheated on you, yet you're
the one house hunting...

1019
01:01:38,978 --> 01:01:41,520
You should have kicked him out!

1020
01:01:41,853 --> 01:01:43,728
I could have...

1021
01:01:44,261 --> 01:01:45,581
The house would have been mine...

1022
01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:48,395
But if my husband cheated on me...

1023
01:01:48,478 --> 01:01:51,687
and then gave me a house
as payment...

1024
01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:54,353
What would I call myself?

1025
01:01:54,853 --> 01:01:55,978
Intelligent!

1026
01:01:56,937 --> 01:01:59,242
How long can you stay in a hostel?

1027
01:02:05,103 --> 01:02:07,270
Hello? Yes sir...

1028
01:02:15,562 --> 01:02:16,978
Hello?

1029
01:02:18,937 --> 01:02:21,062
Come!

1030
01:02:22,937 --> 01:02:23,937
Ok sir...

1031
01:02:24,687 --> 01:02:26,603
- I can't come.
- Why?

1032
01:02:27,437 --> 01:02:30,353
If I don't go they will cancel
my salary and pension.

1033
01:02:30,437 --> 01:02:32,520
It's not like your son
sends us any money!

1034
01:02:32,728 --> 01:02:33,728
Rascal!

1035
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:35,020
Take this.

1036
01:02:35,687 --> 01:02:37,270
Carefully...

1037
01:02:37,937 --> 01:02:40,187
Make sure you donate Rs.
101 at the temple!

1038
01:02:41,062 --> 01:02:42,353
This is our clock now.

1039
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,603
We had 24 months...
We have wasted 4...

1040
01:02:44,645 --> 01:02:46,228
Now we have 20 months left
for launch.

1041
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:51,353
Since we last met, only one
thing has changed...

1042
01:02:51,728 --> 01:02:52,770
The budget!

1043
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,353
Have we got more funds?

1044
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,270
No, our funds have been halved!

1045
01:02:59,062 --> 01:03:02,187
Sir, let's order some strong
tea and brainstorm.

1046
01:03:02,603 --> 01:03:05,395
The money for tea comes
from the budget!

1047
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,645
I suggest you cut down on your
tea drinking habits.

1048
01:03:07,937 --> 01:03:10,770
What am I supposed to do?

1049
01:03:10,853 --> 01:03:13,054
Sir, you are a structural engineer...

1050
01:03:13,211 --> 01:03:15,937
You're responsible for making
the satellite material lighter.

1051
01:03:16,353 --> 01:03:18,853
Lighter in weight and cost.

1052
01:03:19,353 --> 01:03:20,353
Come on!

1053
01:03:28,395 --> 01:03:30,395
Believe it or not,
India is going to Mars!

1054
01:03:30,853 --> 01:03:32,937
Yes, GSLV is a failure.

1055
01:03:33,645 --> 01:03:36,062
Yes, we don't have a rocket
that can take us to Mars.

1056
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:38,728
Nevertheless, we are going to Mars!

1057
01:03:44,132 --> 01:03:45,132
Hello?

1058
01:03:47,103 --> 01:03:49,270
I'm on my way...

1059
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:50,978
I'm coming in a few minutes!

1060
01:03:51,395 --> 01:03:52,687
Kritika, where are you going?

1061
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:56,645
One has flown...

1062
01:03:57,437 --> 01:03:58,645
One wicket down!

1063
01:04:06,728 --> 01:04:08,312
Everyone else is fine...

1064
01:04:28,687 --> 01:04:29,728
Thank you!

1065
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:35,187
I asked for a dosa, not paratha!

1066
01:04:35,437 --> 01:04:37,145
That is a dosa...

1067
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:38,793
- It's so thick...
- Very bad, right?

1068
01:04:39,270 --> 01:04:41,032
Why? Dosa is very good.

1069
01:04:41,149 --> 01:04:42,749
But Delhi has the best
South Indian food!

1070
01:04:42,937 --> 01:04:43,562
True!

1071
01:04:43,687 --> 01:04:45,478
Dosa was born in South India!

1072
01:04:45,645 --> 01:04:47,312
What would you North Indians know?

1073
01:04:47,478 --> 01:04:48,687
You consider paper a dosa!

1074
01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:51,020
I won't argue with you...

1075
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,187
Dosas here, Pooris there...

1076
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:55,145
What are we doing?

1077
01:04:55,252 --> 01:04:57,187
How can such shortcuts
take us to Mars?

1078
01:04:57,395 --> 01:05:01,353
In one week both will lose
their enthusiasm...

1079
01:05:01,645 --> 01:05:04,312
The mission will shut down again...

1080
01:05:04,523 --> 01:05:06,523
And then, I will go on
my pilgrimage!

1081
01:05:08,228 --> 01:05:09,978
I'm going to talk to them.

1082
01:05:11,353 --> 01:05:14,395
I can't believe this...

1083
01:05:14,562 --> 01:05:15,312
Good morning, everyone.

1084
01:05:15,562 --> 01:05:16,562
Good morning, sir

1085
01:05:16,728 --> 01:05:19,103
Tara, what should we name the mission?

1086
01:05:20,048 --> 01:05:21,145
Sir we have an issue.

1087
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:22,853
Varsha is pregnant...

1088
01:05:23,645 --> 01:05:24,645
We need a replacement.

1089
01:05:25,062 --> 01:05:26,062
Why?

1090
01:05:26,645 --> 01:05:29,562
Congratulations on becoming
a mom while going to Mars!

1091
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:31,937
Hey, hey, hey...

1092
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:34,066
MOM!

1093
01:05:34,353 --> 01:05:36,312
Mars Orbiter Mission.

1094
01:05:37,062 --> 01:05:39,103
Fantastic name! Thank you Varsha!

1095
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:43,853
But sir, she will be on 6 month
maternity leave...

1096
01:05:44,395 --> 01:05:45,645
Why can't she work?

1097
01:05:46,395 --> 01:05:47,770
If a scientist is pregnant,

1098
01:05:47,853 --> 01:05:50,937
and has the opportunity to lead the
country's most important mission...

1099
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:52,562
Who are we to stop her?

1100
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:54,687
Of course...

1101
01:05:54,812 --> 01:05:57,603
If she wants to give it all up...

1102
01:05:57,728 --> 01:06:00,353
to stay home, it's her choice.

1103
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:05,395
We can arrange everything
for the baby here...

1104
01:06:06,156 --> 01:06:08,270
We can organize a creche...

1105
01:06:08,687 --> 01:06:11,853
Tara, let her decide if she
wants to be a mom...

1106
01:06:12,228 --> 01:06:13,228
or a MOM Mom!

1107
01:06:13,478 --> 01:06:14,478
Sir...

1108
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,853
Can I take half a day off?

1109
01:06:18,211 --> 01:06:19,395
Please take a seat...

1110
01:06:21,712 --> 01:06:23,228
Sir, I want to work with you...

1111
01:06:23,687 --> 01:06:25,527
I don't want to be a part
of this Mars Mission.

1112
01:06:26,353 --> 01:06:28,187
Sure, sure, I understand...

1113
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:30,353
We'll get you out of that bread project!

1114
01:06:31,478 --> 01:06:34,645
But be there for some time,
we'll work something out.

1115
01:06:35,187 --> 01:06:36,562
Thank you sir!

1116
01:06:39,728 --> 01:06:40,728
Wow!

1117
01:06:40,812 --> 01:06:42,437
Such determination
to get to NASA!

1118
01:06:43,145 --> 01:06:45,145
Buttering up the right man.

1119
01:06:45,562 --> 01:06:47,062
He has a lot of influence there...

1120
01:06:48,062 --> 01:06:50,645
Don't you have better things
to do Parmeshwar?

1121
01:06:50,812 --> 01:06:52,103
No... I mean, yes!

1122
01:06:54,937 --> 01:06:56,353
Any information on Kritika?

1123
01:06:56,770 --> 01:06:58,520
She hasn't answered my calls.

1124
01:07:01,687 --> 01:07:02,587
Where are you going, sir?

1125
01:07:02,641 --> 01:07:04,437
We've worked 2 hours overtime, ma'am.

1126
01:07:04,978 --> 01:07:06,103
Let's continue tomorrow.

1127
01:07:07,274 --> 01:07:09,437
The hostel closes early...

1128
01:07:13,645 --> 01:07:15,478
A friend from the US is waiting
at home, ma'am

1129
01:07:15,687 --> 01:07:16,687
see you tomorrow.

1130
01:07:18,312 --> 01:07:20,562
I have to attend a prayer,
Priest is waiting...

1131
01:07:20,937 --> 01:07:22,937
I'll do the rest tomorrow!

1132
01:07:23,853 --> 01:07:25,270
Ma'am, can I leave too?

1133
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:27,228
I can stay if there's work...

1134
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:28,860
Carry on...

1135
01:07:36,244 --> 01:07:39,437
With these people, the mission
will be very difficult...

1136
01:07:40,103 --> 01:07:42,020
Tara, they are all excellent scientists.

1137
01:07:43,376 --> 01:07:44,812
The problem is...

1138
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:49,562
The Mars Mission is
a dream for you...

1139
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,395
But for them... Just a job!

1140
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:54,395
A 9 to 5 job!

1141
01:07:56,478 --> 01:08:01,020
We need to change their attitude...

1142
01:08:06,270 --> 01:08:08,603
I'm off to Ahmedabad and Trivandrum.

1143
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:10,853
Meeting on PSVL and Payloads

1144
01:08:11,395 --> 01:08:12,437
I'll be back in a week.

1145
01:08:13,103 --> 01:08:14,562
Goodnight.

1146
01:08:30,821 --> 01:08:32,696
Can't sleep?

1147
01:08:33,429 --> 01:08:34,720
Anya and Dilip are asleep?

1148
01:08:36,812 --> 01:08:40,103
Don't look at me like that,
I know it's 11:30...

1149
01:08:40,395 --> 01:08:41,937
Your daughter isn't home yet.

1150
01:08:42,478 --> 01:08:43,878
She isn't even answering the phone!

1151
01:08:44,187 --> 01:08:46,603
But you... Focus on your work!

1152
01:08:47,395 --> 01:08:49,395
These everyday problems
don't concern you, right?

1153
01:08:50,649 --> 01:08:51,853
Why didn't you call me...

1154
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,395
How would that help?

1155
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,770
Hello?

1156
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:05,020
Priya?

1157
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:06,978
Is Anya with you?

1158
01:09:08,437 --> 01:09:09,437
Oh...

1159
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:10,937
You didn't go?

1160
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,149
Where?

1161
01:09:16,645 --> 01:09:18,270
Okay, thank you!

1162
01:09:20,016 --> 01:09:21,520
Get dressed, Sunil.

1163
01:09:22,098 --> 01:09:23,098
Why?

1164
01:09:23,770 --> 01:09:25,478
Get dressed, Sunil.

1165
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,353
Wait Sunil!

1166
01:09:57,478 --> 01:09:58,478
Come here.

1167
01:09:58,645 --> 01:10:00,603
- But Anya's right there!
- Just let her be!

1168
01:10:01,353 --> 01:10:02,353
2 beers, please!

1169
01:10:05,937 --> 01:10:07,687
Thank you Here you go!

1170
01:10:14,687 --> 01:10:15,978
Cheers.

1171
01:10:18,228 --> 01:10:20,645
If you're so worried
about your daughter...

1172
01:10:20,937 --> 01:10:24,353
First save her friends'
phone numbers.

1173
01:10:26,603 --> 01:10:28,395
I love my work!

1174
01:10:28,437 --> 01:10:32,437
Don't try to make me feel
guilty, please!

1175
01:10:34,437 --> 01:10:36,187
I know my daughter, Sunil!

1176
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:43,770
Anya, shots!

1177
01:10:44,103 --> 01:10:45,770
- No I don't drink...
- Hi girls!

1178
01:10:45,978 --> 01:10:47,978
Mom? We were just leaving...

1179
01:10:48,312 --> 01:10:49,478
- Why? So early?
- Sorry.

1180
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:50,812
What shots are we having?

1181
01:10:50,853 --> 01:10:52,937
This is a jagerbomb...

1182
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,145
- Ya? Ya!
- Jagerbomb...

1183
01:10:55,603 --> 01:10:58,437
Sunil!

1184
01:11:03,353 --> 01:11:04,978
Yucks! How do you have this shit, man?

1185
01:11:05,062 --> 01:11:06,937
Ok come let's dance!

1186
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:08,020
Dance?

1187
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,978
Tara please, I'm not coming!

1188
01:11:16,145 --> 01:11:17,728
Come, Sunil!

1189
01:11:24,228 --> 01:11:25,853
Sunil, don't be a bore!

1190
01:11:27,169 --> 01:11:29,185
Yeah dad don't be a bore!

1191
01:11:30,812 --> 01:11:31,978
I'm a bore?

1192
01:12:18,603 --> 01:12:20,312
Oh my god, dad!

1193
01:12:20,395 --> 01:12:21,728
You killed it today!

1194
01:12:21,812 --> 01:12:23,770
It's been so many years since I danced.

1195
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:26,103
Those were the days...

1196
01:12:27,266 --> 01:12:28,770
Don't laugh!

1197
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:31,520
When I was young I dreamt
of being a dancer!

1198
01:12:31,728 --> 01:12:33,020
Then what happened?

1199
01:12:34,145 --> 01:12:35,270
I grew up!

1200
01:12:35,645 --> 01:12:37,145
All my dreams flew away.

1201
01:12:37,437 --> 01:12:39,023
Life changed my moves!

1202
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:40,978
Laugh all you want, you're still young.

1203
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,145
Once you're my age...

1204
01:12:43,478 --> 01:12:46,562
you too will say
"those were the days..."

1205
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:50,319
<i>Dreams...</i>

1206
01:12:59,187 --> 01:13:00,603
Oh, wow!

1207
01:13:01,228 --> 01:13:02,687
Is it your birthday, ma'am?

1208
01:13:02,853 --> 01:13:04,770
No Then whose birthday is it?

1209
01:13:04,853 --> 01:13:06,020
All of ours.

1210
01:13:06,602 --> 01:13:08,937
Happy birthday to the
scientist in all of us!

1211
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,603
Do you remember when you decided
to become a scientist?

1212
01:13:13,197 --> 01:13:14,395
I remember when I did.

1213
01:13:14,853 --> 01:13:18,728
When I was a kid, I went to watch
Star Wars with my dad...

1214
01:13:19,145 --> 01:13:20,395
I was so fascinated!

1215
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:23,603
As soon as I stepped out I knew
what I was going to be...

1216
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:26,187
That day I was born again...

1217
01:13:26,353 --> 01:13:27,520
As a space scientist!

1218
01:13:27,812 --> 01:13:30,812
I am sure you all have similar stories...

1219
01:13:32,688 --> 01:13:36,126
When was the scientist in you born?

1220
01:15:25,794 --> 01:15:28,478
We all have dreams when we are children...

1221
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:32,020
But how many of us get to
live those dreams?

1222
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:34,853
We are so lucky!

1223
01:15:35,212 --> 01:15:37,270
We dreamt of science
and became scientists!

1224
01:15:38,395 --> 01:15:41,062
And then forgot why we became
scientists in the first place!

1225
01:15:42,978 --> 01:15:44,062
Life happens...

1226
01:15:45,603 --> 01:15:46,853
Our everyday problems...

1227
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:51,020
tend to outweigh our
desire to reach for the stars.

1228
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:54,062
Our dreams become 9 to 5 jobs...

1229
01:15:54,478 --> 01:15:55,562
That's life!

1230
01:15:55,843 --> 01:15:59,187
But today, we have a choice.

1231
01:16:00,353 --> 01:16:04,228
We can either look back at our childhood
and think, 'Those were the days'

1232
01:16:04,994 --> 01:16:08,020
Or we can remember those
moments and say...

1233
01:16:09,251 --> 01:16:11,520
'I am going to live my dream!'

1234
01:16:12,728 --> 01:16:14,353
The power of a scientist...

1235
01:16:14,395 --> 01:16:17,395
Is that they can change their nation's
future with their science!

1236
01:16:17,437 --> 01:16:19,020
And today we have that chance!

1237
01:16:19,187 --> 01:16:23,312
If we don't embrace our dreams today

1238
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:25,853
no child will dream of being
a scientist tomorrow!

1239
01:16:28,313 --> 01:16:29,562
I said a lot...

1240
01:16:32,395 --> 01:16:35,645
It's not everyday that we get
the chance to go to Mars...

1241
01:16:42,728 --> 01:16:45,437
Ma'am, this mission won't happen...

1242
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:50,270
until it becomes an obsession!

1243
01:16:55,103 --> 01:16:56,645
I'll let my wife know.

1244
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,395
Tomorrow onwards...
2 portions of curd rice.

1245
01:17:03,173 --> 01:17:04,395
Double shift!

1246
01:17:07,395 --> 01:17:10,020
Ma'am ISRO has an ambulance, right?

1247
01:17:14,132 --> 01:17:17,145
The hostel gate shuts at 8...

1248
01:17:18,645 --> 01:17:19,770
I really don't know...

1249
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,478
You can stay with me!

1250
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:23,395
I just broke up with my boyfriend.

1251
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:24,520
Boyfriend?

1252
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:25,853
Yeah, so?

1253
01:17:26,645 --> 01:17:29,270
Eka, don't lose your freedom!

1254
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:31,395
Meet more men!

1255
01:17:33,812 --> 01:17:35,603
Neha, stay with us...

1256
01:17:36,103 --> 01:17:37,562
My son's room is empty.

1257
01:17:38,145 --> 01:17:41,562
But you'll only get vegetarian food!

1258
01:17:45,062 --> 01:17:47,395
Happy birthday to the
scientist in all of us!

1259
01:17:52,838 --> 01:17:54,020
Where's Kritika?

1260
01:17:54,772 --> 01:17:56,564
Hello sir! How are you feeling?

1261
01:17:57,147 --> 01:17:57,730
Good.

1262
01:17:58,022 --> 01:17:59,022
Wait, I'll do it.

1263
01:18:01,897 --> 01:18:02,897
Take this.

1264
01:18:04,105 --> 01:18:05,480
Please take this, thank you.

1265
01:18:05,564 --> 01:18:07,605
Please take this, thank you.

1266
01:18:08,439 --> 01:18:09,480
You left the Mars Mission?

1267
01:18:10,772 --> 01:18:11,772
Why?

1268
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:15,605
That's not important right now.
First you recover. Eat!

1269
01:18:19,897 --> 01:18:21,480
Not important?

1270
01:18:23,022 --> 01:18:25,262
You were so happy when you
got selected for this mission.

1271
01:18:25,855 --> 01:18:29,064
In this condition I'll be a
weakness for them.

1272
01:18:35,355 --> 01:18:36,855
You wanted to be a Space Scientist...

1273
01:18:37,314 --> 01:18:39,564
So I had to wait five years
to marry you...

1274
01:18:40,897 --> 01:18:42,297
Why are you working as a nurse now?

1275
01:18:43,022 --> 01:18:44,480
Because I married you!

1276
01:18:51,147 --> 01:18:53,897
But if you were hospitalized...

1277
01:18:54,647 --> 01:18:56,480
I wouldn't leave the
battlefield for you.

1278
01:18:57,147 --> 01:18:58,147
That's different.

1279
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,064
That is your duty to your country.

1280
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:07,480
Is your mission any lesser
than an army mission?

1281
01:19:08,980 --> 01:19:10,730
It's equally important for the country.

1282
01:19:12,772 --> 01:19:13,939
This is your duty!

1283
01:19:18,772 --> 01:19:20,314
- Good morning, ma'am!
- Good morning.

1284
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:22,230
Ma'am, can I say something?

1285
01:19:22,610 --> 01:19:24,438
You brought the scientists
back to life...

1286
01:19:24,897 --> 01:19:26,647
Can we add some life to
the Mars Room too?

1287
01:20:55,064 --> 01:20:59,897
Ban plastic! Save the ocean!

1288
01:21:13,548 --> 01:21:15,680
You want to make the satellite
out of waste plastic?

1289
01:21:15,730 --> 01:21:18,605
Sir, for the world this
plastic is pollution...

1290
01:21:19,647 --> 01:21:21,939
But for us it's a solution!

1291
01:21:22,022 --> 01:21:27,230
Mr Iyengar, space maximum temperature
range is -150 degrees celsius cold.

1292
01:21:27,355 --> 01:21:28,522
Or 100 degrees heat...

1293
01:21:28,605 --> 01:21:30,939
It's been in the ocean for 100 years...

1294
01:21:31,272 --> 01:21:35,022
It has endured extreme cold,
heat, pressure...

1295
01:21:35,355 --> 01:21:39,480
Even iron rusts in the ocean...

1296
01:21:40,105 --> 01:21:42,980
But plastic remains the same!

1297
01:21:43,407 --> 01:21:46,897
Sir, if we reinforce the composite
fibre of this and aluminium...

1298
01:21:47,105 --> 01:21:48,897
it will be lighter and stronger!

1299
01:21:49,022 --> 01:21:50,022
Yes!

1300
01:21:51,105 --> 01:21:52,105
The lightest...

1301
01:21:52,564 --> 01:21:54,939
handling extreme conditions in space!

1302
01:21:57,361 --> 01:21:58,361
Test it.

1303
01:22:06,897 --> 01:22:07,897
Fantastic!

1304
01:22:09,314 --> 01:22:12,605
The material cost
and weight has halved...

1305
01:22:12,772 --> 01:22:13,939
So why are you so sad?

1306
01:22:14,147 --> 01:22:15,772
Now can I get a full cup of tea?

1307
01:22:24,605 --> 01:22:28,564
Eka, your trajectory
path is incomplete.

1308
01:22:28,994 --> 01:22:31,439
Sir, I've tried everything!

1309
01:22:32,147 --> 01:22:35,772
This trajectory with 850 kgs fuel...
It's impossible!

1310
01:22:37,564 --> 01:22:39,564
The fuel will run out before
the Mars injection.

1311
01:22:40,022 --> 01:22:41,314
We'll only reach till here!

1312
01:22:41,939 --> 01:22:44,355
Impossible? Did you say 'Impossible?'

1313
01:22:44,814 --> 01:22:46,147
Did you say 'impossible'?

1314
01:22:47,897 --> 01:22:48,897
You know something?

1315
01:22:49,605 --> 01:22:50,965
You're working at the wrong place.

1316
01:22:51,980 --> 01:22:53,980
Just pack your bags, and out!

1317
01:22:55,105 --> 01:22:56,355
Get out of here!

1318
01:22:57,314 --> 01:22:58,314
Useless!

1319
01:23:24,689 --> 01:23:26,355
I'm working at the wrong place.

1320
01:23:26,939 --> 01:23:30,855
I know that! 850 kgs fuel!

1321
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:34,272
Yes! It's impossible.

1322
01:23:35,980 --> 01:23:39,477
Impossible...

1323
01:24:01,105 --> 01:24:02,105
I got it, sir!

1324
01:24:02,438 --> 01:24:04,814
We'll have to change the
satellite design slightly.

1325
01:24:04,977 --> 01:24:08,272
If we position the solar panel
and the antenna this way

1326
01:24:08,522 --> 01:24:09,939
just like a ship's sail.

1327
01:24:10,230 --> 01:24:11,230
It's so simple!

1328
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:14,480
The satellite can move ahead using
the solar radiation pressure

1329
01:24:14,564 --> 01:24:17,647
the same way a ship uses
wind pressure to sail.

1330
01:24:17,712 --> 01:24:18,480
Without fuel!

1331
01:24:18,564 --> 01:24:21,689
This way we can keep the satellite
running without using any extra fuel!

1332
01:24:23,355 --> 01:24:24,480
There's one problem, sir.

1333
01:24:24,897 --> 01:24:27,272
Adding the antenna makes
the satellite wider.

1334
01:24:27,647 --> 01:24:29,897
How will it fit into the PSLV?

1335
01:24:30,022 --> 01:24:32,855
Fitting large things into small
spaces is my area of expertise.

1336
01:24:33,105 --> 01:24:34,522
Don't worry, I'll solve this!

1337
01:24:35,022 --> 01:24:36,730
Well done. Congratulations!

1338
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,897
Sir, he's watching you.

1339
01:24:39,522 --> 01:24:40,897
- Sorry!
- Great job, Eka!

1340
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:41,564
Thanks!

1341
01:24:41,897 --> 01:24:42,897
Brilliant idea.

1342
01:24:43,022 --> 01:24:44,689
A little fire at the right moment...

1343
01:24:44,772 --> 01:24:47,064
and even the brain works
at a higher orbit!

1344
01:24:48,564 --> 01:24:49,564
Hey!

1345
01:24:50,522 --> 01:24:52,647
I've been trying to call you!

1346
01:24:53,189 --> 01:24:54,956
There's an opening, you can
rejoin my department.

1347
01:24:54,980 --> 01:24:56,314
Sir, about that...

1348
01:24:57,314 --> 01:24:59,855
Thank you, but I'd like to stay
with the Mars Mission.

1349
01:25:01,266 --> 01:25:03,105
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1350
01:25:16,897 --> 01:25:17,897
Any progress?

1351
01:25:18,189 --> 01:25:19,355
Not really, ma'am...

1352
01:25:19,564 --> 01:25:20,804
The review committee is coming.

1353
01:25:20,855 --> 01:25:22,815
If the camera isn't ready,
what will we show them?

1354
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:27,147
Parmeshwar you have to think
out of the box! We don't have time!

1355
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:32,897
Parmeshwar! Take a break.

1356
01:25:33,689 --> 01:25:36,314
Let's get some fresh air. Come!

1357
01:25:44,272 --> 01:25:45,897
You're a virgin, right?

1358
01:25:47,689 --> 01:25:48,730
Meaning?

1359
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:49,855
Meaning of "virgin"?

1360
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,564
No! I mean, why?

1361
01:25:52,855 --> 01:25:55,022
Why what? It's clear.

1362
01:25:55,980 --> 01:25:59,022
You just need sex... Don't mistake it for
love's gravitational force!

1363
01:25:59,105 --> 01:26:03,314
No. I'll have sex only after marriage!

1364
01:26:05,314 --> 01:26:06,314
Seriously!

1365
01:26:09,064 --> 01:26:10,522
Who's going to marry you?

1366
01:26:11,055 --> 01:26:14,897
You need experience for that.
Marriage is not a Mars Mission.

1367
01:26:22,189 --> 01:26:26,564
Does your family believe in astrology?

1368
01:26:27,939 --> 01:26:28,939
Astrology?

1369
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:34,022
Fool!

1370
01:26:35,105 --> 01:26:36,897
I don't even know who my parents are.

1371
01:26:38,605 --> 01:26:40,439
Or where and when I was born...

1372
01:26:43,522 --> 01:26:45,189
But your surname, Gandhi?

1373
01:26:46,230 --> 01:26:51,064
All the kids in my orphanage
had the surname Gandhi!

1374
01:26:51,230 --> 01:26:51,897
Why's that?

1375
01:26:51,980 --> 01:26:54,730
He's the Father of the nation, isn't he?

1376
01:26:58,022 --> 01:27:00,897
To fit the antenna, the material
should be flexible.

1377
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:03,647
Change the umbrella's design.

1378
01:27:04,189 --> 01:27:05,439
You change the material.

1379
01:27:05,522 --> 01:27:07,980
Change to cloth! It's lighter too.

1380
01:27:08,314 --> 01:27:09,647
You're mad?

1381
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:12,939
It's an antenna. How will
cloth send the signal?

1382
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,355
It will sir, just like metal!

1383
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:17,897
Come, I'll show you.

1384
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:24,605
A small asteroid stone will be
enough to tear the cloth!

1385
01:27:25,272 --> 01:27:27,814
Sir, this wolverine material.

1386
01:27:27,897 --> 01:27:31,980
Once torn, it can repair itself.
See!

1387
01:27:32,439 --> 01:27:34,730
It's a good solution,
but an expensive one...

1388
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:38,466
Good job!

1389
01:27:39,480 --> 01:27:40,564
Thank you, sir.

1390
01:27:50,022 --> 01:27:52,897
Who's that? Your husband?

1391
01:27:55,980 --> 01:27:56,980
Yes, sir.

1392
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:02,355
You can make a satellite intelligent
enough to repair itself...

1393
01:28:02,855 --> 01:28:06,897
you don't have the intelligence
to repair your life?

1394
01:28:07,730 --> 01:28:10,814
Oh no! Bloody fellow... Get off!

1395
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:13,189
- What happened, sir?
- Quick, get off!

1396
01:28:13,571 --> 01:28:15,272
- But what happened?
- Go stand there.

1397
01:28:20,439 --> 01:28:23,314
He knocked me over!

1398
01:28:24,605 --> 01:28:25,939
It wasn't my fault...

1399
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:31,980
I'm okay! Get on, quick!

1400
01:28:33,897 --> 01:28:35,022
Bash him.

1401
01:28:35,814 --> 01:28:36,939
Is the heart repaired?

1402
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:40,689
If he had been bashed up more
your heart would have felt even better...

1403
01:28:41,105 --> 01:28:42,355
Sir, you're completely mad!

1404
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,105
The Finance Report has arrived.

1405
01:28:44,272 --> 01:28:47,230
You're Rs. 700 to 800
million over budget.

1406
01:28:47,814 --> 01:28:51,064
Look at the Ahmedabad cost
for transponders, sensors...

1407
01:28:51,897 --> 01:28:54,814
Where will we get the money
to manufacture everything?

1408
01:28:55,147 --> 01:28:59,730
The Rs. 4 billion budget from
Chandrayan 2 is almost over.

1409
01:29:01,147 --> 01:29:02,814
Rework your priorities.

1410
01:29:05,187 --> 01:29:07,772
Sir, I was saying...
Sir, sir, sir!

1411
01:29:10,105 --> 01:29:11,439
If we talk to the government...

1412
01:29:11,772 --> 01:29:14,147
Sir, one minute, please!

1413
01:29:14,855 --> 01:29:16,480
Go ahead... sorry sir.

1414
01:29:16,564 --> 01:29:20,730
I agree, there's no money left
from Chandrayan 2 budget...

1415
01:29:20,939 --> 01:29:24,272
But doesn't Chandrayan 2 already have
all the things we need the money for?

1416
01:29:24,899 --> 01:29:26,064
What do you mean?

1417
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:28,272
Sir, what are we ordering
from Ahmedabad?

1418
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,647
Sensors, transponders,
all the instruments?

1419
01:29:30,897 --> 01:29:32,980
But everything is already
available in Chandrayan 2!

1420
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:36,439
The project has stopped indefinitely.

1421
01:29:36,814 --> 01:29:39,522
So why don't we ask for everything
we need from Chandrayan 2?

1422
01:29:39,939 --> 01:29:41,022
Why waste?

1423
01:29:45,897 --> 01:29:46,980
Women, sir...

1424
01:29:47,105 --> 01:29:49,980
Take last night's leftover dinner,
throw in some spices

1425
01:29:50,064 --> 01:29:51,939
and serve it the next
day for breakfast!

1426
01:29:53,605 --> 01:29:54,605
Why waste!

1427
01:29:54,897 --> 01:29:58,689
Is there no difference between Home Science
and Rocket Science for you people?

1428
01:29:58,855 --> 01:30:00,355
It's all the same, sir.

1429
01:30:00,711 --> 01:30:02,230
What are you doing, sir!

1430
01:30:25,689 --> 01:30:27,230
The colour camera's going over weight.

1431
01:30:27,522 --> 01:30:30,022
The satellite will be in Eclipse
Mode for 24 minutes.

1432
01:30:30,897 --> 01:30:33,522
One battery lasts 40 minutes, right?

1433
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:35,230
So, why use two?

1434
01:30:35,272 --> 01:30:37,730
For safety. Two's better than one.

1435
01:30:37,814 --> 01:30:38,814
Then why not 5?

1436
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:42,730
Bring the whole generator in for safety!
Shift to 1 battery.

1437
01:30:43,022 --> 01:30:44,502
The weight will automatically reduce.

1438
01:30:45,855 --> 01:30:49,064
Camera is now ready for installation.
Satellite is ready for production!

1439
01:31:32,022 --> 01:31:35,689
MOM is a good name. But let's
find a name with more weight!

1440
01:31:37,064 --> 01:31:41,272
All this time we've been
trying to reduce weight...

1441
01:31:41,355 --> 01:31:44,522
But if you say so...
You tell us, sir!

1442
01:31:44,605 --> 01:31:45,605
Mangalyaan?

1443
01:32:26,439 --> 01:32:27,480
Shit!

1444
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:30,647
Must have hanged...

1445
01:32:31,730 --> 01:32:32,730
What are you doing?

1446
01:32:33,564 --> 01:32:36,647
Switch off-on always
works in hang mode.

1447
01:32:38,314 --> 01:32:40,480
See! Switch off.

1448
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:43,022
Go to sleep. Or else you'll collapse!

1449
01:32:43,105 --> 01:32:45,064
We've sent 2 INA ships
to the Pacific Ocean.

1450
01:32:45,147 --> 01:32:46,456
They haven't even reached
their positions yet!

1451
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:48,105
The rocket is launching from India...

1452
01:32:48,564 --> 01:32:50,404
Why are you sending ships
to the Pacific Ocean?

1453
01:32:50,647 --> 01:32:52,355
Our technique is a little different...

1454
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:55,647
When the Satellite rotates
around the earth...

1455
01:32:55,730 --> 01:32:58,939
We'll have to monitor it
through various countries.

1456
01:32:59,814 --> 01:33:03,897
But there's a huge gap between Australia
and America which is the Pacific Ocean.

1457
01:33:04,022 --> 01:33:07,647
So we are sending ships there,
with mobile tracking centres.

1458
01:33:08,064 --> 01:33:09,224
And they haven't reached yet.

1459
01:33:09,439 --> 01:33:11,772
It's the Indian Navy. They'll reach.

1460
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:13,110
Now go to sleep.

1461
01:33:15,147 --> 01:33:17,564
There's a storm in the
Bay of Bengal...

1462
01:33:36,439 --> 01:33:37,939
Such bad weather, all across!

1463
01:33:38,147 --> 01:33:40,355
How can we launch with
thunder and lightning?

1464
01:33:40,647 --> 01:33:42,355
Weather forecast study...

1465
01:33:44,439 --> 01:33:45,522
Basic sense...

1466
01:33:46,355 --> 01:33:47,355
Abort it!

1467
01:33:47,855 --> 01:33:49,314
Wait 3 years, you can go later.

1468
01:33:50,522 --> 01:33:52,064
Don't you dare say abort.

1469
01:33:52,522 --> 01:33:54,355
Rakesh, relax.

1470
01:33:54,689 --> 01:33:56,064
Tell him to relax, sir!

1471
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:57,897
Tell him to shut up!

1472
01:33:57,939 --> 01:33:58,939
Rakesh!

1473
01:33:59,814 --> 01:34:00,897
Take it easy.

1474
01:34:01,730 --> 01:34:03,210
You're teaching me about basic sense?

1475
01:34:04,897 --> 01:34:05,980
Weather forecast means

1476
01:34:06,064 --> 01:34:08,647
making an estimate, and nobody
in the world can be 100% sure.

1477
01:34:09,272 --> 01:34:11,272
Tsunamis don't warn you
a month in advance.

1478
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:13,855
So you, just shut your trap!

1479
01:34:14,105 --> 01:34:15,980
Hey! Do you know who you're talking to?

1480
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:20,564
I'm talking to a man who doesn't
have the basic sense to know

1481
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:23,891
that even a 2-bit scientist always
has a back up plan!

1482
01:34:24,480 --> 01:34:26,040
Just look at these conditions,
you can't launch!

1483
01:34:26,064 --> 01:34:28,480
We have a 9 day buffer, sir!

1484
01:34:29,689 --> 01:34:32,230
Until 5th November,
we can launch anytime!

1485
01:34:32,772 --> 01:34:33,772
After which?

1486
01:34:33,897 --> 01:34:37,689
After which either he lives or I do.
Sorry, sir.

1487
01:34:39,522 --> 01:34:42,064
So for the time being, the
mission is on standby.

1488
01:34:43,269 --> 01:34:46,561
Why don't you guys just chill
out, and have a drink?

1489
01:34:46,743 --> 01:34:48,022
It's badly needed, right?

1490
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:52,397
Suppose you're standing on Mars...

1491
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:57,022
will you be heavier or lighter?

1492
01:34:57,673 --> 01:34:59,965
Right now my head is heavy,
so please be quiet.

1493
01:35:01,381 --> 01:35:03,943
<i>Storm in Pacific Ocean
and a cyclone in Bay of Bengal...</i>

1494
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:06,256
Not this again. Someone switch it off.

1495
01:35:06,340 --> 01:35:09,131
<i>India's Mars dreams are now put on hold,
indefinitely...</i>

1496
01:35:11,256 --> 01:35:15,381
Tara, looks like all our dreams
are definitely indefinite. Cheers!

1497
01:35:20,715 --> 01:35:23,840
You've all have had too much to
drink. Thank god for the metro!

1498
01:35:24,548 --> 01:35:25,548
This way, sir.

1499
01:35:31,892 --> 01:35:33,183
Are you blind?

1500
01:35:34,517 --> 01:35:36,767
He spilled my coffee!

1501
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:37,850
Sorry...

1502
01:35:43,517 --> 01:35:46,767
<i>Storms have postponed the Mars Mission.</i>

1503
01:35:51,100 --> 01:35:52,350
Have you lost it?

1504
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,433
- Don't hit me...
- Sit down!

1505
01:35:58,267 --> 01:35:58,975
Switch that off!

1506
01:35:59,058 --> 01:36:00,100
Look at this drunkard...

1507
01:36:00,642 --> 01:36:02,392
- Handle him, ma'am!
- Please!

1508
01:36:31,558 --> 01:36:32,600
He will die!

1509
01:36:38,975 --> 01:36:44,058
If I ever see you again
I will kill you!

1510
01:36:49,407 --> 01:36:52,642
Are you okay, sir? What happened?

1511
01:38:14,673 --> 01:38:17,548
Mom, I have always wondered...

1512
01:38:17,938 --> 01:38:21,589
in spite of being a scientist
why do you pray so much?

1513
01:38:22,506 --> 01:38:23,881
Because I believe in God!

1514
01:38:24,589 --> 01:38:26,548
There is a power beyond science.

1515
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,214
Time to change the God?

1516
01:38:31,548 --> 01:38:34,881
Changing a picture or a prayer
doesn't change the power.

1517
01:38:37,256 --> 01:38:38,964
Pray to whatever God you want...

1518
01:38:39,589 --> 01:38:43,149
Just pray to the power,
not to the picture.

1519
01:38:55,798 --> 01:38:57,214
Tomorrow's the last day...

1520
01:38:58,798 --> 01:39:00,464
If we can't launch tomorrow...

1521
01:39:18,048 --> 01:39:23,631
Rakesh, is there any chance
we can launch after today?

1522
01:39:24,406 --> 01:39:27,198
Changing our trajectory,
increasing the speed...

1523
01:39:31,031 --> 01:39:32,073
Tara?

1524
01:39:33,489 --> 01:39:35,946
No, sir. We'll miss Mars.

1525
01:39:54,406 --> 01:39:55,406
Mission abort!

1526
01:39:57,448 --> 01:39:59,157
Mission abort!

1527
01:40:05,489 --> 01:40:06,489
Sorry Sir.

1528
01:41:15,906 --> 01:41:19,448
Tara! Weather is clearing! Come on,
everybody! Come on!

1529
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:29,904
Mission reactivate!

1530
01:41:38,739 --> 01:41:40,489
Check Pacific Ocean ship status!

1531
01:41:40,823 --> 01:41:41,823
Yes sir, checking sir!

1532
01:41:43,906 --> 01:41:45,946
The storm's getting weaker
in the Pacific Ocean too.

1533
01:41:46,489 --> 01:41:47,757
By the time the satellite is in orbit...

1534
01:41:47,781 --> 01:41:49,823
the ships will be in their
tracking positions, sir.

1535
01:41:52,448 --> 01:41:53,698
PSLV ready for launch.

1536
01:41:53,989 --> 01:41:55,429
Mission Control waiting for command.

1537
01:41:55,489 --> 01:41:58,049
This is Rakesh Dhawan. Mission Control
initiating command for launch.

1538
01:41:58,073 --> 01:42:00,156
(CHANTS)

1539
01:42:00,739 --> 01:42:02,031
Hurry up, Panditji!

1540
01:42:08,781 --> 01:42:10,281
All departments ready for procedure!

1541
01:42:12,739 --> 01:42:13,907
All procedures start.

1542
01:42:15,031 --> 01:42:16,323
Satellite integration status...

1543
01:42:17,239 --> 01:42:19,698
100% integration. Good to go, sir!

1544
01:42:20,448 --> 01:42:21,614
Go/no go for payloads...

1545
01:42:22,323 --> 01:42:22,864
Go!

1546
01:42:23,239 --> 01:42:24,479
Communication and navigation...

1547
01:42:25,656 --> 01:42:26,656
Go, sir!

1548
01:42:26,781 --> 01:42:27,781
Program autonomy...

1549
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:29,239
Go, sir!

1550
01:42:29,323 --> 01:42:30,364
Structural design...

1551
01:42:30,989 --> 01:42:31,656
Go!

1552
01:42:31,781 --> 01:42:32,781
Propulsion control...

1553
01:42:33,281 --> 01:42:34,281
Go!

1554
01:42:35,864 --> 01:42:39,323
We are good to go for launch!

1555
01:42:40,281 --> 01:42:42,711
Initialising countdown sequence...

1556
01:44:07,156 --> 01:44:09,823
The roll program is successful,
now entering MAX Q

1557
01:44:10,031 --> 01:44:10,739
Roger that.

1558
01:44:10,906 --> 01:44:15,156
Altitude 45,000 feet.
Velocity is at MACH 1.3.

1559
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:23,549
Sir, we are now ready for staging.

1560
01:44:23,573 --> 01:44:24,573
Copy that. Go!

1561
01:44:33,739 --> 01:44:35,406
First stage separation complete!

1562
01:44:44,864 --> 01:44:46,406
Second stage separation complete!

1563
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:52,573
Fairing separation looks good.

1564
01:45:00,156 --> 01:45:01,698
Third stage separation complete!

1565
01:45:08,573 --> 01:45:10,573
Earth marking orbit insertion complete.

1566
01:45:16,156 --> 01:45:18,156
Tracking stations active
over the Pacific Ocean.

1567
01:45:18,489 --> 01:45:20,114
Communication established successfully!

1568
01:45:21,051 --> 01:45:23,051
Supervising control online, Sir!

1569
01:45:32,156 --> 01:45:33,781
Satellite approaching perigee.

1570
01:45:38,948 --> 01:45:41,062
Orbit raising manoeuvre 1...
Fire!

1571
01:45:48,323 --> 01:45:50,383
Engine shut down.
Back to fuel save mode.

1572
01:45:58,198 --> 01:46:00,447
Orbit raising manoeuvre 2...
Fire!

1573
01:46:03,864 --> 01:46:05,864
Engine shut down.
Back to fuel save mode.

1574
01:46:15,489 --> 01:46:16,739
Fire!

1575
01:46:19,364 --> 01:46:20,364
Fire!

1576
01:46:23,073 --> 01:46:24,073
Fire!

1577
01:46:30,239 --> 01:46:32,323
Final earth gravitational exit...
Fire!

1578
01:46:32,656 --> 01:46:33,656
Copy that.

1579
01:46:38,031 --> 01:46:40,073
Sir the engine isn't firing...
What?

1580
01:46:41,698 --> 01:46:43,323
The satellite is still
in the same orbit!

1581
01:46:44,323 --> 01:46:47,007
It will take 6 days for the satellite to
come back to the firing position.

1582
01:46:47,031 --> 01:46:48,073
What!

1583
01:46:52,031 --> 01:46:54,823
We don't have a single buffer day,
no extra fuel!

1584
01:46:55,739 --> 01:46:57,281
How will we reach Mars on time?

1585
01:46:58,448 --> 01:47:00,198
We have fuel for one more firing sir.

1586
01:47:01,573 --> 01:47:04,030
But how we'll reach in time,
I don't know...

1587
01:47:04,163 --> 01:47:05,781
Sir, there's nothing much we can do.

1588
01:47:05,864 --> 01:47:07,544
Let's just hope for the best,
and go ahead.

1589
01:47:07,614 --> 01:47:09,147
Anyway, we have no choice!

1590
01:47:12,573 --> 01:47:13,614
Sorry for this...

1591
01:47:24,781 --> 01:47:26,989
Final Earth exit maximum fire!

1592
01:47:27,013 --> 01:47:28,571
Copy that.

1593
01:47:30,114 --> 01:47:31,114
Fire successful!

1594
01:47:38,180 --> 01:47:40,019
Satellite entering Van Allen Belt!

1595
01:47:59,739 --> 01:48:01,614
We have crossed the Van Allen Belt!

1596
01:48:02,156 --> 01:48:03,156
Yes!

1597
01:48:06,281 --> 01:48:08,406
Well done! Well done, folks!

1598
01:48:09,323 --> 01:48:10,364
Salute to the fried bread!

1599
01:48:10,573 --> 01:48:11,573
Come on, guys.

1600
01:48:11,989 --> 01:48:13,813
We're 6 days late!

1601
01:48:14,073 --> 01:48:19,454
Mars isn't going to wait because India has
managed to cross the Van Allen Belt!

1602
01:48:20,448 --> 01:48:22,698
10 months remain for
the final destination...

1603
01:48:23,198 --> 01:48:25,073
Please wait to celebrate our failure.

1604
01:49:26,837 --> 01:49:27,837
Hello?

1605
01:49:30,462 --> 01:49:30,878
What!

1606
01:49:31,045 --> 01:49:32,670
We've lost all communication!

1607
01:49:32,878 --> 01:49:34,229
Looks like the satellite got hit by

1608
01:49:34,253 --> 01:49:36,962
asteroids and solar
radiation all at once!

1609
01:49:37,045 --> 01:49:38,713
It could be a solar storm.

1610
01:49:41,170 --> 01:49:43,322
Back up systems will
fail any minute now!

1611
01:49:43,837 --> 01:49:46,072
Satellite has been in hang mode
for the last 20 minutes.

1612
01:49:55,003 --> 01:49:56,003
Kritika...

1613
01:49:56,587 --> 01:49:57,781
Kritika what are you doing?

1614
01:49:59,003 --> 01:50:00,003
What!

1615
01:50:00,670 --> 01:50:01,696
What did you do?

1616
01:50:03,128 --> 01:50:04,128
What!

1617
01:50:04,253 --> 01:50:05,545
Have you lost your mind?

1618
01:50:06,045 --> 01:50:08,071
How will you reestablish communication?

1619
01:50:08,170 --> 01:50:10,320
We have lost the satellite, Kritika!

1620
01:50:21,587 --> 01:50:23,128
Communication re-established!

1621
01:50:24,503 --> 01:50:27,295
We are back in control!
Reboot successful!

1622
01:50:29,503 --> 01:50:30,753
I'm sorry, ma'am.

1623
01:50:31,003 --> 01:50:34,045
Switching it off and on was the
only thing I could think of!

1624
01:50:35,878 --> 01:50:38,920
Satellite speed is 72,000 kms/hr!

1625
01:50:39,503 --> 01:50:41,878
The solar storm has increased
the speed of the satellite!

1626
01:50:43,337 --> 01:50:45,128
We just made up the 6 day gap!

1627
01:50:46,795 --> 01:50:49,920
We will reach Mars on time!
With extra fuel!

1628
01:50:52,545 --> 01:50:54,962
You are a genius!

1629
01:50:57,170 --> 01:51:01,628
Eka, satellite is slightly off trajectory.
Fire all right thrusters.

1630
01:51:01,712 --> 01:51:02,712
I'm on it!

1631
01:51:05,337 --> 01:51:07,253
Neha, check tech damage!

1632
01:51:10,587 --> 01:51:13,878
Satellite autonomy intact, and
antenna in self repair mode!

1633
01:51:14,045 --> 01:51:15,128
Looks fine sir!

1634
01:51:31,295 --> 01:51:33,587
It's a historical day for India!

1635
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:35,295
The whole world is watching us.

1636
01:51:35,503 --> 01:51:38,378
Today is the day that Mangalyaan
is all set to meet Mars!

1637
01:51:50,712 --> 01:51:53,587
The last leg of Mangalyaan
is the most difficult.

1638
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:55,280
The stage of entering Mars' orbit!

1639
01:51:55,337 --> 01:51:58,212
To enter Mars' orbit, Mangalyaan's
speed will have to come down...

1640
01:51:58,295 --> 01:52:02,920
from 72,000 km/hr to 15,000 km/hr.

1641
01:52:03,170 --> 01:52:05,962
Start procedures for
Mars orbit insertion!

1642
01:52:20,045 --> 01:52:23,587
Imagine a car travelling at 70,000 km/hr
without brakes...

1643
01:52:23,712 --> 01:52:25,003
How will it slow down?

1644
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,545
If you reverse the car and press
the accelerator...

1645
01:52:31,712 --> 01:52:34,503
the reverse force can reduce
the speed.

1646
01:52:34,712 --> 01:52:38,337
180 degree axis reverse braking maneuver
to achieve speed reduction, sir.

1647
01:52:38,670 --> 01:52:39,670
Copy that!

1648
01:52:46,337 --> 01:52:48,462
Waking up LAM engine from hibernation!

1649
01:52:48,753 --> 01:52:50,545
Fire maximum all thrusters!

1650
01:52:59,003 --> 01:53:00,795
If the satellite's speed
cannot be reduced,

1651
01:53:01,003 --> 01:53:04,266
then it will go past Mars and
be lost in space forever.

1652
01:53:55,045 --> 01:53:56,295
Why isn't the speed reducing?

1653
01:53:56,628 --> 01:53:58,727
It should be 15,000. What is wrong?

1654
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:02,212
Communication black out, sir.
Mangalyaan in eclipse mode.

1655
01:54:02,962 --> 01:54:05,712
We will have to wait 24 minutes
to find out if it's in orbit.

1656
01:54:10,920 --> 01:54:14,712
Has Mangalyaan entered Mars' orbit?
Or has it passed Mars?

1657
01:54:14,837 --> 01:54:20,337
If it has caught the orbit, it will
emerge from behind Mars...

1658
01:54:20,712 --> 01:54:25,128
In 24 minutes, we will know if the
Mars Mission is a success or a failure.

1659
01:54:28,003 --> 01:54:30,920
Please, please, please activate all
autonomous back up systems!

1660
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:33,070
Will the battery back up be enough?

1661
01:54:33,295 --> 01:54:34,962
We'll know in 12 minutes!

1662
01:54:36,670 --> 01:54:41,795
If the satellite is safe I promise
to be celibate for life...

1663
01:54:44,337 --> 01:54:45,878
All aligned for orbit re-entry.

1664
01:54:46,295 --> 01:54:48,503
Orbit entry interface
expected any moment.

1665
01:55:16,087 --> 01:55:18,003
Sir, please pray...

1666
01:55:20,795 --> 01:55:23,920
I've never known any religion
other than science!

1667
01:55:24,587 --> 01:55:26,253
Come on!

1668
01:55:28,378 --> 01:55:31,212
Come on, come on, come on...

1669
01:56:14,837 --> 01:56:16,875
Ma'am, signal reaquisition picking!

1670
01:56:46,878 --> 01:56:49,753
Mangalyaan insertion in
Mars orbit successful sir!

1671
01:56:50,170 --> 01:56:52,985
Tell the whole world... Copy that!

1672
01:56:55,587 --> 01:56:58,212
Copy that!

1673
01:57:27,128 --> 01:57:28,795
Mars image coming up sir!

1674
01:58:01,045 --> 01:58:03,962
Dad, you forgot to pay the bill!

1675
01:58:44,920 --> 01:58:47,045
NASA would like to... Not again!

1676
01:58:47,128 --> 01:58:48,896
NASA would like to collaborate
with us for its future missions!

1677
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:49,587
What?

1678
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,545
I'm getting calls from all over
the world! Thanks to you, Rakesh!

1679
01:58:52,837 --> 01:58:53,837
Not me.

1680
01:58:54,045 --> 01:58:56,852
Thank ISRO's 17,000
scientists and engineers.

1681
01:58:57,712 --> 01:59:00,259
Actually thank you too!

1682
01:59:00,503 --> 01:59:00,837
Me?

1683
01:59:01,003 --> 01:59:02,087
- Yeah!
- What did I do?!

1684
01:59:02,212 --> 01:59:05,253
A strong opposition pushes you to win!

1685
01:59:05,712 --> 01:59:08,795
And you, are a damn strong opposition.

1686
01:59:09,837 --> 01:59:12,878
- Congratulations!
- Yes! We did it!

1687
01:59:13,753 --> 01:59:14,337
What?

1688
01:59:14,545 --> 01:59:15,884
You didn't watch TV, why?

1689
01:59:16,837 --> 01:59:18,063
The power was cut off?

1690
01:59:18,795 --> 01:59:19,962
Sunil!

1691
01:59:20,212 --> 01:59:23,628
Sir, thankfully the mission
was called MOM.

1692
01:59:24,212 --> 01:59:28,753
If it was called DAD, it wouldn't
have stood a chance!

1693
01:59:30,837 --> 01:59:31,837
Let's go for coffee?

1694
01:59:33,087 --> 01:59:34,795
Didn't you swear to be celibate?

1695
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:37,503
Mars has been conquered, who cares!

1696
01:59:37,587 --> 01:59:38,795
Thank you, thank you!

1697
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:41,545
I'll be home soon. We'll
cook and eat dinner together.

1698
01:59:42,253 --> 01:59:45,128
Listen, if I have the government's
recommendation,

1699
01:59:45,212 --> 01:59:46,795
I'll get my driver's license right?

1700
01:59:46,920 --> 01:59:51,295
Ma'am do you think I'll get a small
living quarters at ISRO now?

1701
01:59:52,509 --> 01:59:53,509
Doubt it.

1702
01:59:57,253 --> 02:00:01,795
Look at Mars! One day,
you can go there too.

1703
02:01:51,837 --> 02:01:59,837
India is the first nation in the world
to reach Mars on its very first attempt!

1704
02:02:03,253 --> 02:02:08,920
In Ahmedabad, to travel 1 km
by rickshaw costs Rs. 10.

1705
02:02:09,712 --> 02:02:13,587
But it cost ISRO only Rs. 7
per kilometre to get to Mars!

1706
02:02:15,378 --> 02:02:17,003
And that's not all!

1707
02:02:18,087 --> 02:02:21,712
At a budget lesser than that
of a Hollywood space movie...

1708
02:02:21,837 --> 02:02:24,212
We actually went to Mars!
