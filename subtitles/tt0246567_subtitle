Udup Pandit has
stopped taking new disciples

20
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:45,302
He feels that people
are losing faith...

21
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:48,482
...and this
education does not give jobs.

22
00:03:49,617 --> 00:03:53,610

After the death of five sons...

23
00:03:53,687 --> 00:03:58,282

vowed in front of God.

00:04:00,326 --> 00:04:04,352
- Please try, I am eager.
- OK. Don't worry...

25
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:07,592
...tonight I shall talk to him.

26
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:12,464
He is stubborn, but
usually does not refuse me.

27
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,062
- Friend, try your best.
- Don't worry.

28
00:04:24,714 --> 00:04:26,340
Coming, Mother.

29
00:04:30,586 --> 00:04:32,281
Ma, I am here.

30
00:04:36,758 --> 00:04:40,660
You are a nut.
Can't even tie your dhoti.

31
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:43,727
Who'll tie your dhoti there?

32
00:04:43,897 --> 00:04:48,334
You must learn to dress yourself.

33
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,197
You must wash your own clothes,
make your own bed.

34
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:56,297
- Ma, I will sleep alone there?
- Yes, dear.

35
00:04:56,608 --> 00:05:03,070
Don't cry, Ma. Don't cry.

36
00:05:07,384 --> 00:05:11,218

Which way? This or that?

69
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,087
I don't know the way.

I've to go to Udup Pandit's house.

71

75
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:41,703
Anyone home?

76
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,586
I know not the means to worship...

77
00:10:59,557 --> 00:11:02,788
Yet I bow to thee.

78
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:22,036
Is this the house?

79
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,510
Yes. Go in I'll
come by the backdoor.

80
00:11:24,612 --> 00:11:26,546
- Luggage?
- I'll bring it.

81

Cause behind all cause.

82

Brightness of all
light I pray to thee.

83
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:55,503
- Where is reverend Guru?
- He is in his prayers.

84
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,539
We bow to Lord Shiva.

85
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,390
Greetings Sir.

86
00:13:02,998 --> 00:13:08,163
So, you have come with
some new questions today.

87
00:13:09,336 --> 00:13:11,099
Some interesting topic?

88
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:15,335
Nothing new, the same old
story of the 'snake and the rope'

89
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:17,000
Snake and rope.

90
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:20,302
Take your seat.

91
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:31,411
The story of the snake and the rope...

92
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:35,216
...is relevant in all ages.

93
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:41,086
An illusion of the senses.

94
00:13:43,466 --> 00:13:46,230
Eyes mistook a rope for a snake.

95
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:53,174
Body responded by getting defensive.

96
00:13:54,575 --> 00:13:58,238
Hands got ready to...

97
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,437
...pick up a weapon.

98
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:07,511
An exercise in futility.

99
00:14:08,455 --> 00:14:11,150
All due to lack of proper knowledge.

100
00:14:12,158 --> 00:14:14,149
All due to an illusion.

101
00:14:15,061 --> 00:14:16,289
Greetings, Sir.

102
00:14:16,595 --> 00:14:19,028
They have been waiting for long.

103
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:23,158
I shall beg your leave, Sir.

104
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:33,634
Yes.

105
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:36,576
Sir, I am Rameshwar
Bhatt from Kudu village...

106
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:38,306
...Son of Gangadhar Bhatt.

107
00:14:39,115 --> 00:14:40,741
What brings you here?

108
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:44,608
This is my son, Narayan Bhatt.

109
00:14:45,654 --> 00:14:49,555
I want him to be a scholar of 'Vedas.

110
00:14:49,623 --> 00:14:52,456
I do not have room for more pupils.

111
00:14:52,593 --> 00:14:56,084
- Take him else where.
- But I came with high hopes.

112
00:14:56,162 --> 00:14:58,756
True, but I cannot take more pupils.

113
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,368
My hands are full with two pupils.

114
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,295
One is an orphan and
the other a pamper.

115
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:09,163
Please allow me to say a few words.

116
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,303
Speak.

117
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:15,573
Sir, I have lost five sons.

118
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:19,678
I vowed that, if
even I have another son.

119
00:15:20,083 --> 00:15:24,417
I shall dedicate him
to the service of God.

120
00:15:25,055 --> 00:15:28,546
So I'm here with him...

121
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:32,754
...immediately after
the Thread Ceremony.

122
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,622
- Come here boy.
- Go, Son.

123
00:15:40,001 --> 00:15:40,797
Your name?

124
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:45,095
Belonging to the lineage of
the sage Angirasa, Ambarish.

125
00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:51,140
Youvanaasava, I, Narayan Bhatt.

126
00:15:51,277 --> 00:15:53,108
Bow to you

127
00:15:53,212 --> 00:15:56,511
I bow to you.

128
00:15:58,984 --> 00:16:02,681
Narayan! Lovely name.

129
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:07,953
- What do they call you at home?
- Nanni.

130
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:14,354
Your son is bright.

131
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:18,166
You really want to
dedicate him to scriptures?

132
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:19,493
Yes, Sir.

133
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,961
- Shastri.
- Yes.

134
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:27,634
- Who's this new creature?
- Looks well to do.

135
00:16:30,178 --> 00:16:33,670
- Will you keep my word?
- Your wish is order for me.

136
00:16:34,248 --> 00:16:40,379
Do not waste any more time here.
Go home right now.

137
00:16:41,388 --> 00:16:45,016
But I had planned to spend
four days with the boy here.

138
00:16:45,157 --> 00:16:47,182
Don't waste more time.

139
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:51,156
This boy got initiated the moment...

140
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:55,597
...he came and sat on my lap.

141
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,961
Leave. As you wish, Sir.

142
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:04,038
The child's cries
will reach your ears.

143
00:17:04,408 --> 00:17:06,308
But you will not return.

144
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:12,546
Daddy, don't go.

145
00:17:13,683 --> 00:17:15,411
Get detached.

146
00:17:16,284 --> 00:17:20,015
It'll do your son good.

147
00:17:21,022 --> 00:17:23,114
- Yamuna.
- Coming.

148
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,023
Don't go, dad.

149
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,559
Don't cry, brother.

150
00:17:39,638 --> 00:17:42,106
Leave me

151
00:17:45,343 --> 00:17:47,243
I'll go back to my father.

152
00:17:47,311 --> 00:17:49,302
Come, I'll show you the cowshed.

153
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:53,314
We've here a yard and a well.

154
00:17:57,287 --> 00:17:59,619
Meet your class friends.

155
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,149
This is Vishwanath Shastri.

156
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:05,352
This is Ganesh Bhatt.

157
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:07,688
And this is our Nanni...

158
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,159
...Narayan Bhatt. He
will stay with you all.

159
00:18:10,231 --> 00:18:14,565
Ganesh, take him to
the well Come, Nanni.

160
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:21,233
Such a big boy should not cry.

161
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:34,608
Sir, I'm leaving Narayan
at the Seminary 'Gurukul'

162
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:36,420
Take care of him.

163
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:40,717
'Gurukul' is a place of
hard work, strick discipline.

164
00:18:41,492 --> 00:18:42,652
Rest is God's wish.

165
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:46,560
- Where are you from?
- Kudu village.

166
00:18:47,063 --> 00:18:49,691

168
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:54,067
Come, I'll show you.

169
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:57,268
Put it in.

170

This is not home.
You've to help yourself here.

171
00:19:01,677 --> 00:19:07,410
Yes, Keep pulling.

172
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:19,446
Dropped the bucket! Shame on you.

173
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,728
Stop crying and let us sleep.

174
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:33,262
Why such kids are sent here.

175
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,562
What's the matter Nanni?

176
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:41,736
I want to go home.

177
00:19:43,546 --> 00:19:46,379
Why? You don't like it here?

178
00:19:49,417 --> 00:19:53,353
What! Can't tie your dhoti yourself?

179
00:19:55,156 --> 00:19:58,556
Come, I'll show you.

180
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,598
Now what?

181
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,162
These rascals are after you?

182
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:17,407
Come, I'll take you to a nice place.

183
00:20:17,509 --> 00:20:20,568
I'll sleep with you.

184
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:25,206
No dear, here the pupils
sleep with their 'Guru'.

185
00:20:25,282 --> 00:20:27,511
No, I'll sleep with you,
I'll sleep with you.

186
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:30,417
Be a good boy.

187
00:20:36,024 --> 00:20:40,358
Don't cry. Come,
I'll take you to father.

188
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:46,663
No one will disturb you here.

189
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,293
Still awake?

190
00:20:51,004 --> 00:20:54,235
He was scared.
So I've brought him to you.

191
00:20:54,341 --> 00:20:58,572
Don't be scared.
Recite the verse to conquer fear.

192
00:21:00,312 --> 00:21:02,746
Yamuna, you too go to sleep.

193
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,051
Come here.

194
00:21:11,523 --> 00:21:14,958
Listen to me carefully.

195
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:27,192
The first lesson here is
to learn to help yourself.

196
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:34,474
Wash your own clothes, make
your own bed, wash your own dish.

197
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:37,201
This is the life of a 'Brahmachari'.

198
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:13,506
Who am I, where did I come from.

199
00:22:17,012 --> 00:22:24,315
I bow to the Sun God
Destroyer of darkness & sins.

200
00:22:48,373 --> 00:22:54,709
O Sun God, liberate from the
sins I might have committed.

201
00:23:21,135 --> 00:23:22,159
Greetings, Holy Sir.

202
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:27,400
No, a pious lady should
not touch others' feet.

203
00:23:28,441 --> 00:23:30,534
She herself to be worshipped.

204
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,472
She may touch here husband's feet...

205
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:38,273
...and of course, Udup Pandit's.

206
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,244
God bless you.

207
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,648
Truth is often bitter.

208
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:50,958
Isn't it, Sreekar?

209
00:24:02,404 --> 00:24:03,598
God bless you.

210
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:14,913
Here are ten fingers.

211
00:24:23,623 --> 00:24:24,715
Yes, dear.

212
00:24:31,496 --> 00:24:36,933
O Fire God, invite the
Goddess of good fortune.

213
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,466
Yes, Nanni.

214
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,141
Thy are the creator.

215
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,644
Thy art the preserver.

216
00:24:59,988 --> 00:25:02,513
Thy art the Destroyer.

217
00:25:18,204 --> 00:25:20,603
Don't get distracted.

218
00:25:21,506 --> 00:25:23,565
Pay attention.

219
00:25:36,686 --> 00:25:39,348
Don't spoil my offerings.

220
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:44,181
Everybody's after me.

221
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,152
Yamuna...

222
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,264
Getting late to the temple.

223
00:25:51,532 --> 00:25:54,501
Coming. Don't blame me later.

224
00:25:55,736 --> 00:25:57,396
Go and meet her.

225
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,543
The tail of the money Lord.

226
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:16,476
The two are getting fat
with every passing day.

227
00:26:18,222 --> 00:26:20,553
Yamuna, have you heard?

228
00:26:20,657 --> 00:26:24,218
My neighbour has
sold off all the gold...

229
00:26:24,327 --> 00:26:26,659
...of her sisterinlaw.

230
00:26:30,332 --> 00:26:33,358
Oh, you are the new pupil?

231
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:36,062
Howled the roof down for two nights.

232
00:26:37,105 --> 00:26:39,699
What are you staring at?
Say something.

233
00:26:39,941 --> 00:26:42,034
Swallowed a snake?

234
00:26:42,377 --> 00:26:44,606
Laughing on top of that.

235
00:26:46,013 --> 00:26:49,005
- Where are you?
- Come, Nanni.

236
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:55,152
Don't be afraid,
Touch Godavari auntie's feet.

237
00:26:56,556 --> 00:27:01,583
Nanni, have you brought
some offerings for your 'Guru'

238
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,992
Or is it free for you too?

239
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:06,394
Enough. Now bless him.

240
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:09,125
Am I not right? Everybody knows...

241
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,667
...Ganesh and Shastri enjoy free...

242
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:12,630
...boarding and lodging.

243
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:16,862
Let's not talk of these
things on way to the temple.

244
00:27:17,474 --> 00:27:21,877
Am I not right? Have a long life.

245
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:31,916
Nanni's getting a lot
of attention these days.

246
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,153
Leave it to me.
I'll teach him a lesson.

247
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,460
- Help me climb down.
- Coming.

248
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:47,194
Who has sent such a kid
to the 'Gurukul'.

249
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,034
Be careful.

250
00:27:57,642 --> 00:28:01,270
Come on, <i>CryBaby.</i>

251
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:04,070
Coming.

252
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,253
No, your pronunciation is faulty.

253
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:31,001
The verse says, the
mind is in one place.

254
00:28:31,938 --> 00:28:35,305
And yet it is wandering.

255
00:28:36,042 --> 00:28:38,533
Like yours is, right now.

256
00:28:39,545 --> 00:28:43,606
You are not fully attentive today.

257
00:28:43,949 --> 00:28:45,075
What's the matter?

258
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,378
Why don't we leave our
discussions for tomorrow?

259
00:28:47,451 --> 00:28:49,146
I have a problem.

260
00:28:52,456 --> 00:28:55,891
Tomorrow morning
I'm going to the river bank.

261
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:03,262
I'll beg your leave now.

262
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,527
Tomorrow evening
we'll continue our discussion.

263
00:29:10,371 --> 00:29:11,633
Thank you.

264
00:29:29,989 --> 00:29:33,151
Kogal! Come and have a drink.

265
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:34,658
No drinks for me.

266
00:29:35,627 --> 00:29:38,323
Now a days he drinks only holy water.

267
00:29:38,563 --> 00:29:42,191
One needs just a bowl of rice water.

268
00:29:44,101 --> 00:29:47,036
You live on the left
overs of Brahamins.

269
00:29:47,104 --> 00:29:49,435
You have become half Brahmin.

270
00:29:51,241 --> 00:29:54,404
I belong here.
I will never abandon you.

271
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:57,972
Drinks are bad! Give me smoke.

272
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,640
He was a Brahmin in his last Birth.

273
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:05,581
Then how did he take birth again?

274
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:11,955
Forget about society and caste.
Who knows whose son I am.

275
00:30:12,192 --> 00:30:14,558
And who has fathered him.

276
00:30:16,062 --> 00:30:18,428
What a thing to say.

277
00:30:24,036 --> 00:30:26,061
Come here my pet.

278
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,340
Your friends were asking for you.

279
00:30:38,649 --> 00:30:41,913
Met them, they were
offering my drinks.

280
00:30:42,151 --> 00:30:44,016
Why did you refuse?

281
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,449
I don't like it.

282
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,527
They call you 'KogaBrahmin'

283
00:30:58,332 --> 00:30:59,526
Aunty!

284
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:06,268
Who am I? Tell the truth.

285
00:31:08,174 --> 00:31:10,142
Who are my parents?

286
00:31:10,677 --> 00:31:15,204
You are my pet. I'm your father.
I am your mother.

287
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:16,440
Ask no more.

288
00:31:16,515 --> 00:31:22,976
You're joking. How can
you be both my parents?

289
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:31,217
How does that matter? The seed
doesn't matter. The fruit does.

290
00:31:34,431 --> 00:31:39,959
How did my parents look?

291
00:31:40,703 --> 00:31:43,228
Beautiful! 'Better than you'

292
00:31:47,508 --> 00:31:51,102
Now select a girl for
yourself and settle down.

293
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:54,413
Or else who will look
after you when I am gone?

294
00:31:55,949 --> 00:32:00,009
I'll break your leg.
Where will you go?

295
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,588
You're both my Ma and Dad!

296
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:16,232
Deluge! The earth will fall apart.

297
00:32:20,904 --> 00:32:26,341
She keeps hogging and
the old lady starves.

298
00:32:33,248 --> 00:32:35,307
You here!

299
00:32:35,384 --> 00:32:37,544
You didn't come to the river bank.

300
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:43,686
You were telling dad about it.

301
00:32:44,358 --> 00:32:48,453
Yamuna, When will you understand...

302
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:53,896
No need to understand.

303
00:35:01,878 --> 00:35:03,277
Sweetmeat!

304
00:35:24,931 --> 00:35:27,091
Auntie, how are you?
Fine.

305
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:29,325
Brought the meat? What meat?

306
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:33,028
A carcass has been
brought in the village.

307
00:35:33,138 --> 00:35:34,627
Every one's taking a share.

308
00:35:35,306 --> 00:35:38,104
Flesh of a dead animal is not good.

309
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,445
Look what I've brought for you.

310
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:58,388
The young boy in the
Gurukul has given.

311
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:05,588
You eat. I will be going.

312
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:22,578
You know why a Brahmin
is called twice born?

313
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,281
His body is born in
his father's house.

314
00:38:27,022 --> 00:38:30,458
His soul blossoms in
his teacher's abode.

315
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,961
So a pupil is like a son to his Guru.

316
00:38:44,604 --> 00:38:46,400
What's it, Koga!

317
00:38:50,509 --> 00:38:51,908
Get up, Koga.

318
00:38:59,017 --> 00:39:04,079
Reverend, my aunt is dead.

319
00:39:08,759 --> 00:39:11,090
Life and death is all destiny.

320
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:13,759
Control yourself.

321
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:18,556
Let a good soul go to heaven.

322
00:39:19,267 --> 00:39:25,330
Sir, my aunt suffered a lot for me.

323
00:39:32,279 --> 00:39:36,408
She must get peace in the other world.

324
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,915
Please see to that...

325
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:46,490
I do not perform last rites...

326
00:39:47,192 --> 00:39:50,456
You'll have to look
for another Brahmin.

327
00:39:51,229 --> 00:39:55,131
I don't know if you'll find one.

328
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:57,291
Reverend, just one wish.

329
00:39:58,101 --> 00:40:04,471
Recite some holy verses in her ears.

330
00:40:07,176 --> 00:40:11,839
Put some holy water,
and Tulsi leaves in her mouth.

331
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:19,281
She will get salvation.

332
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:24,489
Ganesh, get the holy
water and Tulsi leaves.

333
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:44,031
I am untouchables.
I don't touch holy water.

334
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,107
You're right, Koga.

335
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:53,975
You are bound by your traditions.

336
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:56,478
So I am.

337
00:40:57,252 --> 00:41:02,315
I don't want last rites.
A little holy water from you is enough.

338
00:41:07,295 --> 00:41:08,853
As you wish.

339
00:41:29,047 --> 00:41:30,605
I have things to tell you.

340
00:41:30,882 --> 00:41:32,406
What is it, aunt?

341
00:41:32,484 --> 00:41:37,284
Things are going to dogs.
Do something.

342
00:41:37,354 --> 00:41:42,053
Your father would have
stopped such things.

343
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,058
But what happened?

344
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,497
Evil times! Brahmins
performing last rites of untouchables.

345
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:53,827
What are you saying!

346
00:41:54,402 --> 00:41:57,894
Who is it?
Who is challenging religion?

347
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:00,072
Who has done this evil deed?

348
00:42:22,193 --> 00:42:28,393
The soul is immortal,
even when body perishes.

349
00:42:37,073 --> 00:42:44,035
Aunt, aren't you pleased now?

350
00:42:44,246 --> 00:42:50,309
The holy one has graced your soul.

351
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,920
Tell my parents there, I am fine.

352
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,472
Now all untouchables
will ask for last rites.

353
00:43:26,382 --> 00:43:29,442
...baptizing and wedding rites.

354
00:43:31,853 --> 00:43:34,981
They will enter holy places.

355
00:43:37,793 --> 00:43:41,888
And your Guru will be
responsible for all this.

356
00:43:42,196 --> 00:43:43,561
Friend.

357
00:43:43,798 --> 00:43:50,600
No, I am not your friend now.
We are fighting a war of religion.

358
00:43:51,605 --> 00:43:55,802
We have to take sides.

359
00:43:57,209 --> 00:44:00,975
You decide whose side you will be in.

360
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,840
Don't over react.

361
00:44:04,382 --> 00:44:10,320
Am I? Didn't the issues of 'Sati',
Child marriage, Devadasis.

362
00:44:10,387 --> 00:44:14,153
Start like this?

363
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:19,553
And today the law
has abolished them all.

364
00:44:20,963 --> 00:44:24,921
Your Guru is a devotee of
Ganapati the deity of the down trodden.

365
00:44:25,033 --> 00:44:27,092
You hobnob with the British.

366
00:44:27,268 --> 00:44:30,533
How can I trust you all?

367
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:42,376
Sreekar, you are trying my patience.

368
00:44:45,051 --> 00:44:48,110
You and your Guru will be
engulfed by the flames...

369
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,884
Manjunath, what do
you expect me to do?

370
00:44:53,892 --> 00:44:58,055
Go and tell that proud Brahmin.

371
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:03,096
If he does not listen to
reason we will go to 'Gokarn'...

372
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,858
'Sringeri', 'Kanchi'
and spread the word.

373
00:45:06,803 --> 00:45:10,330
Go and give him a
warning on our behalf.

374
00:45:22,750 --> 00:45:23,910
Sir!

375
00:45:27,187 --> 00:45:29,314
What have you done.

376
00:46:07,456 --> 00:46:10,857
Have you eaten?

377
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,159
Come here Koga.

378
00:46:20,166 --> 00:46:21,360
Sit here.

379
00:46:26,539 --> 00:46:29,507
Koga, your aunt's no more.

380
00:46:30,075 --> 00:46:34,341
I have prayed for her soul.

381
00:46:37,014 --> 00:46:39,244
Take these.

382
00:46:42,386 --> 00:46:44,945
Your aunt will go to heaven.

383
00:46:45,889 --> 00:46:48,289
Don't cry, Koga. Don't cry.

384
00:46:59,301 --> 00:47:01,531
Come, Sreekar brother, be seated.

385
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:03,568
Where is Sir?

386
00:47:03,806 --> 00:47:07,070
Father is coming.
I'll get some coffee for you.

387
00:47:34,032 --> 00:47:37,990
Sir, I'll come some
other time. Good bye.

388
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:45,063
Greetings, Sir.
Have you been waiting for long?

389
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:59,348
- Sreekar, any problem?
- Yes, Sir.

390
00:48:02,323 --> 00:48:06,157
You are brooding over something.

391
00:48:06,227 --> 00:48:10,026
Sir, Brahmins here are agitated.

392
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,328
Slightest provocation
is enough for them.

393
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:25,106
What I did was not for
the salvation of the dead.

394
00:48:26,044 --> 00:48:28,979
It was to comfort a living creature.

395
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:32,377
Oh else Koga would
have been shattered.

396
00:48:33,884 --> 00:48:37,910
It don't want to debate
in defence of my action.

397
00:48:38,988 --> 00:48:40,512
I listened to my inner voice.

398
00:48:51,066 --> 00:48:54,193
But it is prohibited
in our scriptures.

399
00:48:54,268 --> 00:48:56,259
Which scripture, dear?

400
00:49:00,374 --> 00:49:04,810
I don't remember having
taught you such scriptures.

401
00:49:05,078 --> 00:49:07,945
But it is against our traditions.

402
00:49:09,348 --> 00:49:11,873
So tradition are above scriptures!

403
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:15,415
That is what you what to prove?

404
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:21,423
Traditions are made by us.

405
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:29,521
Relevant to a Society,
keeping with the times.

406
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:40,366
We frame rules for the
Society to lead a life of Virtue.

407
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:45,136
But these rules can not be eternal.

408
00:49:45,513 --> 00:49:48,106
They change with times.

409
00:49:48,815 --> 00:49:51,443
Have not our attires
undergone change with time?

410
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:54,248
Have we not changed in so many ways?

411
00:49:54,587 --> 00:49:58,353
We crop our hair the British way.

412
00:49:58,924 --> 00:50:03,951
Pants have replaced dhotis.
But we are still Brahmins.

413
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:07,822
I thought it's my duty
to make the reaction...

414
00:50:08,633 --> 00:50:10,190
...of the villagers known to you.

415
00:50:10,567 --> 00:50:12,159
So I am here.

416
00:50:12,536 --> 00:50:17,200
This is not the first time
I've provoked the Brahmins.

417
00:50:21,077 --> 00:50:23,102
When Yamuna came back as a widow.

418
00:50:24,881 --> 00:50:28,213
I allowed her to keep her hair long.

419
00:50:32,054 --> 00:50:39,186
Narrow mindedness has
made our Society corrupt.

420
00:50:40,561 --> 00:50:45,998
We are hypocrites.

421
00:50:48,301 --> 00:50:58,800
Mercifully there are a few
progressive individuals among us.

422
00:51:06,016 --> 00:51:08,075
Don't you analyse these matters?

423
00:51:08,518 --> 00:51:13,477
I do, sir and am pained.

424
00:51:18,227 --> 00:51:22,390
Sometimes I feel scared.

425
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:30,493
Do you? That's good sign.

426
00:51:32,573 --> 00:51:35,234
Asking questions is
a progressive sign.

427
00:51:35,975 --> 00:51:40,571
And being progressive is living.

428
00:51:43,048 --> 00:51:47,951
That is why I have hopes on you.

429
00:51:48,854 --> 00:51:50,377
Though you are so fickle minded.

430
00:51:52,123 --> 00:51:58,527
I know, you will speak my
language when I'm no more.

431
00:52:01,431 --> 00:52:09,201
Sir, it is my misfortune
that I have been engaged.

432
00:52:10,272 --> 00:52:13,570
A representative of the
Brahmin community here.

433
00:52:14,976 --> 00:52:17,035
I do not agree with them.

434
00:52:18,546 --> 00:52:20,945
If you had agreed.

435
00:52:22,149 --> 00:52:25,277
...it would have meant defeat for me.

436
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,485
Will you be out this season?

437
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:36,856
No. Any work for me?

438
00:52:37,162 --> 00:52:40,529
Come and teach the boys
like you did last year.

439
00:52:41,299 --> 00:52:43,563
Do the daily rituals.

440
00:52:44,535 --> 00:52:46,264
Surely, sir.

441
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:06,285
Sir is coming.

442
00:53:14,561 --> 00:53:20,329
Yamuna, I shall be going.
Take care of the boys.

443
00:53:20,934 --> 00:53:25,927
They should not bath in the
river and should study well.

444
00:53:26,171 --> 00:53:28,105
I've told Sreekar.

445
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,141
Take care of your sister.

446
00:53:41,184 --> 00:53:46,211
It's your responsibility.

447
00:53:53,161 --> 00:53:58,189
On my way back I'll
go to your village.

448
00:53:58,866 --> 00:54:00,356
I'll meet your parents.

449
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:01,995
...Any message?

450
00:54:16,348 --> 00:54:18,077
God bless you all.

451
00:55:34,228 --> 00:55:38,221
- Come, I'll show you something.
- Where're you taking me?

452
00:55:39,567 --> 00:55:42,034
This is a beautiful jungle.

453
00:55:43,737 --> 00:55:45,068
Aren't there ruins here?

454
00:55:48,141 --> 00:55:50,108
- What is this?
- The snake God.

455
00:55:50,242 --> 00:55:52,836
- Can you touch it?
- I haven't taken bath yet.

456
00:55:52,978 --> 00:55:55,469
- So what?
- Can you touch?

457
00:55:55,614 --> 00:55:57,205
Shall I show? See.

458
00:55:59,517 --> 00:56:01,246
You will be cursed.

459
00:56:01,619 --> 00:56:03,484
As if! I'm telling you.

460
00:56:03,955 --> 00:56:05,478
- You touch.
- No.

461
00:56:11,794 --> 00:56:12,886
Don't be scared.

462
00:56:13,896 --> 00:56:15,056
The Eagle God.

463
00:56:15,164 --> 00:56:18,497
He protects me from snakes.

464
00:56:19,935 --> 00:56:24,497
If you obey me, my eagle
will you protect you too.

465
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:26,539
You don't tell anyone.

466
00:56:26,608 --> 00:56:28,632
Not even Yamuna.

467
00:56:32,446 --> 00:56:33,572
Yamuna, you.

468
00:56:34,481 --> 00:56:35,674
Greetings, brother.

469
00:56:37,517 --> 00:56:39,815
- Where are the boys?
- Gone to pluck flowers.

470
00:56:40,553 --> 00:56:43,885
When will they study?
Wasting valuable time.

471
00:56:48,026 --> 00:56:51,586
We should be
punctual like the British.

472
00:56:53,097 --> 00:56:56,863
- We should be disciplined.
- Have patience.

473
00:56:57,168 --> 00:57:00,500
They will be back any moment.

474
00:57:00,737 --> 00:57:02,227
What shall I do till then?

475
00:57:06,075 --> 00:57:08,475
Talk to your little sister.

476
00:57:09,178 --> 00:57:16,606
We haven't sat and talked for ages.

477
00:57:19,888 --> 00:57:23,618
Yes, Yamuna how the days have flown.

478
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,854
But nothing has changed.

479
00:57:32,064 --> 00:57:33,429
Isn't it?

480
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:37,493
- In the mean time you...
- Get you a hot cup of coffee.

481
00:57:46,477 --> 00:57:49,742
You touched the snake God
before taking your bath.

482
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:51,813
Those sins are being washed now.

483
00:58:02,457 --> 00:58:05,654
Touch your new Guru's feet.

484
00:58:05,794 --> 00:58:07,124
Come on!

485
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:14,701
From today,
You'll comply with all my wishes...

486
00:58:14,834 --> 00:58:17,496
...obey all my orders.

487
00:58:18,138 --> 00:58:20,834
Only then my Eagle will protect you.

488
00:58:21,574 --> 00:58:24,770
I bless you with courage.

489
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,410
This is your second purification.

490
00:58:29,481 --> 00:58:31,914
Sir has asked us not
to bathe in the river.

491
00:58:31,983 --> 00:58:33,143
Stupid, this is only a stream.

492
00:58:44,628 --> 00:58:46,925
My favourite dish!

493
00:58:49,532 --> 00:58:50,794
You still remember my tastes.

494
00:58:52,468 --> 00:58:54,935
But, I haven't said my
morning prayers yet.

495
00:58:55,437 --> 00:58:56,529
Not yet.

496
00:58:57,038 --> 00:58:58,665
And you've come to teach!

497
00:58:59,641 --> 00:59:02,108
Is this what you've
learnt from the British.

498
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:10,846
You haven't changed a bit. The
same happy, mischievous creature.

499
00:59:12,518 --> 00:59:15,578
Keep smiling like this all your life.

500
00:59:16,222 --> 00:59:18,587
You have my blessings with you.

501
00:59:46,882 --> 00:59:47,973
Where had you been?

502
00:59:49,717 --> 00:59:50,843
It's very late.

503
00:59:52,453 --> 00:59:53,545
Don't you have to study?

504
00:59:57,457 --> 00:59:59,118
Today I'm not punishing you.

505
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:04,988
From tomorrow,
everything should be in time.

506
01:00:07,566 --> 01:00:11,092
Must up hold the dignity
of this house of learning.

507
01:00:11,436 --> 01:00:12,460
Understood?

508
01:00:13,571 --> 01:00:14,697
Go and study.

509
01:00:25,615 --> 01:00:26,707
OK, Yamuna.

510
01:00:28,684 --> 01:00:33,916
It's late today. I've to go
to the Britisher's quarters.

511
01:01:16,026 --> 01:01:20,621
We are taking you to a secret place.

512
01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:22,727
Don't ask questions.

513
01:01:23,065 --> 01:01:25,795
Do you know what is inside the tree?

514
01:01:27,602 --> 01:01:30,765
This is the above of last souls.

515
01:01:31,005 --> 01:01:34,497
There's ghosts and spirits.

516
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,639
Do you know what is
inside the crevice?

517
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:42,143
Don't be scared. Touch it and see.

518
01:01:46,085 --> 01:01:48,645
Remember what I taught you?

519
01:01:48,921 --> 01:01:52,856
Don't tell anybody about all this.

520
01:01:52,958 --> 01:01:54,755
Not even Yamuna.

521
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,457
Hail Eagle

522
01:05:04,958 --> 01:05:09,122
Ganesh, Somebody's here.

523
01:05:09,829 --> 01:05:11,022
Someone went in the dark.

524
01:05:15,401 --> 01:05:16,993
- Was it a thief?
- May be.

525
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:18,766
We've to keep a watch.

526
01:05:37,019 --> 01:05:39,988
Why do you move back on seeing me?

527
01:05:42,824 --> 01:05:44,485
Don't you understand?

528
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:49,720
Brahmin walks forward, Koga,
walks backward.

529
01:05:49,963 --> 01:05:52,124
Koga, you are strange.

530
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,894
You dance while you walk.
You walk when you very much.

531
01:05:56,936 --> 01:06:01,532
- You don't like me?
- No, I like you very much.

532
01:06:01,674 --> 01:06:04,005
- You like me?
- Very much.

533
01:06:05,911 --> 01:06:08,573
Then why do you move
back on seeing me?

534
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:12,547
Touching Koga means losing caste.

535
01:06:12,783 --> 01:06:14,910
- Whose caste?
- Yours.

536
01:06:15,152 --> 01:06:16,483
Why?

537
01:06:17,822 --> 01:06:22,451
We are Shudras
the lowest of the low.

538
01:06:22,592 --> 01:06:24,059
My touch will pollute you.

539
01:06:26,596 --> 01:06:28,119
No. I'll touch you, I'll touch you.

540
01:06:39,374 --> 01:06:42,433
Come down, I'll touch you.

541
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:51,874
Wind can touch me,
water can touch me...

542
01:06:51,951 --> 01:06:54,078
Sun can touch me, Brahmin cannot.

543
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:57,686
Koga, You'll fall and die.

544
01:07:03,695 --> 01:07:07,960
Koga, I won't touch you, come down.

545
01:07:10,634 --> 01:07:12,864
I'll never talk to you, Koga.

546
01:07:37,357 --> 01:07:38,619
Has anybody seen you?

547
01:07:39,893 --> 01:07:41,019
No.

548
01:07:57,108 --> 01:08:01,134
- Recognized?
- No.

549
01:08:02,813 --> 01:08:05,043
Not thief, someone else.

550
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:07,940
Seems he comes to Yamuna.

551
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:10,384
Must do something.

552
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:12,748
Must catch Yamuna red handed.

553
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:16,416
Then we can blackmail her.

554
01:08:16,591 --> 01:08:19,492
Think of a way to trap her.

555
01:08:24,631 --> 01:08:25,723
Do one thing.

556
01:08:27,401 --> 01:08:29,801
Wait, don't run away.

557
01:08:33,773 --> 01:08:38,334
Come, don't be a coward.

558
01:08:38,777 --> 01:08:43,578
A wandering soul
comes as a ghost to us.

559
01:08:43,648 --> 01:08:45,081
And super ghost?

560
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:48,785
When some one's dear wish
is unfulfilled in life...

561
01:08:48,853 --> 01:08:56,418
...his soul becomes a
super ghost after death.

562
01:08:56,759 --> 01:08:59,660
He may take any body's appearance.

563
01:08:59,896 --> 01:09:05,026
Some super ghosts attack
beautiful lonely women.

564
01:09:18,812 --> 01:09:21,144
What happened to your Dhoti?

565
01:09:21,848 --> 01:09:23,577
What a racket.

566
01:09:24,750 --> 01:09:28,846
It seems a superb ghost
has untied his dhoti.

567
01:09:29,588 --> 01:09:31,851
Come and sit here.

568
01:09:33,858 --> 01:09:35,450
Go, if you want to.

569
01:09:35,894 --> 01:09:39,624
Someone must guard Yamuna.

570
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,957
Keep your eyes and ears open.

571
01:09:42,633 --> 01:09:46,069
And tell us if the super ghost comes.

572
01:09:46,803 --> 01:09:49,327
He may wear any body's mask.

573
01:09:54,343 --> 01:09:57,038
Now go; my eagle will protect you.

574
01:10:13,526 --> 01:10:15,460
Open the door, Yamuna.

575
01:10:18,363 --> 01:10:19,830
It's me.

576
01:10:26,370 --> 01:10:28,463
Who is it, sister? Super ghost?

577
01:10:32,376 --> 01:10:34,468
You go to sleep and
don't feel scared.

578
01:10:35,078 --> 01:10:36,909
I'll drive him away.

579
01:10:50,425 --> 01:10:53,394
Go away, super ghost.
How dare you scare my Nanni.

580
01:10:53,895 --> 01:10:57,352
Why don't you understand?
Nanni sleeps with me nowadays.

581
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:00,491
Sister, take the broom.

582
01:11:02,469 --> 01:11:04,766
Go, or I'll thrash you.

583
01:11:29,492 --> 01:11:30,891
Has he gone?

584
01:11:32,528 --> 01:11:35,587
Yes, you to sleep.

585
01:11:38,433 --> 01:11:39,991
Will he return?

586
01:11:40,636 --> 01:11:45,504
No, but don't tell
any one I won't tell.

587
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:49,039
I won't tell anybody,
not even Shastri.

588
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:51,934
OK. Now go to sleep.

589
01:12:12,997 --> 01:12:15,430
Did any body come last night?

590
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:17,726
In sister's room?

591
01:12:17,801 --> 01:12:20,634
- I don't know.
- Any familiar face?

592
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:24,030
You are telling lies.

593
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:25,835
I went to sleep last night.

594
01:12:26,776 --> 01:12:29,869
OK. Read on. Don't sleep
off henceforth understand?

595
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:38,280
Nanni, come up with your books.

596
01:12:38,352 --> 01:12:39,683
Coming.

597
01:12:53,598 --> 01:12:55,930
Let you live a hundred autumns.

598
01:13:02,306 --> 01:13:05,867
Where are you?
Haven't seen you for two days.

599
01:13:09,913 --> 01:13:11,904
Are you ill?

600
01:13:17,086 --> 01:13:18,815
No sign of lunch today.

601
01:13:21,857 --> 01:13:23,585
Here she comes.

602
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,327
Had your food?

603
01:13:29,630 --> 01:13:32,894
Serves you right.

604
01:13:32,966 --> 01:13:34,763
Starve! Starve!!

605
01:13:36,837 --> 01:13:38,303
Who's it?

606
01:13:42,742 --> 01:13:46,768
Koga, why hasn't Yamuna made lunch?

607
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:51,381
- Don't know.
- Is she ill?

608
01:13:52,517 --> 01:13:53,847
Don't ask me.

609
01:14:16,804 --> 01:14:20,433
Chop the wood mean while,
chop them small.

610
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:18,489
Finished chopping?

611
01:15:18,691 --> 01:15:20,591
Here's your food.

612
01:15:38,342 --> 01:15:40,071
Rotten food!

613
01:15:58,793 --> 01:16:02,456
What! Giving your
left overs to the cow!

614
01:16:02,997 --> 01:16:05,590
I'll curse you to death.

615
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:08,664
What's so funny?

616
01:16:08,902 --> 01:16:12,393
I'll break your teeth.

617
01:16:13,539 --> 01:16:16,940
Look! Even the cow
is refusing your food.

618
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:46,024
Fire is the teacher.

619
01:16:46,601 --> 01:16:53,506
Fire is the purifier.

620
01:16:55,409 --> 01:16:59,538
Salutations to thee
Salutation to thee.

621
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:47,281
Yamuna, listen!

622
01:17:50,924 --> 01:17:53,892
Yesterday also you didn't let me in.

623
01:17:57,897 --> 01:18:01,457
- What's the matter? Tell me.
- What's there to tell?

624
01:18:03,068 --> 01:18:06,435
If this seed of my sin
starts growing within me.

625
01:18:06,738 --> 01:18:11,902
Don't worry.
All problems will be solved.

626
01:18:13,677 --> 01:18:14,938
Solved?

627
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:21,744
What will be solved? Where shall go?

628
01:18:23,919 --> 01:18:28,515
Think of my father's position.

629
01:18:31,325 --> 01:18:33,555
I don't know what you feel.

630
01:18:36,731 --> 01:18:43,932
But I cannot forgive
myself for what has happened.

631
01:18:45,571 --> 01:18:50,008
Go to the big temple tomorrow.

632
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:52,735
No one returns
disappointed from there.

633
01:19:12,395 --> 01:19:14,920
Nanni, I'll pluck it for you.

634
01:19:17,499 --> 01:19:20,991
- Where's Yamuna?
- She's got malaria.

635
01:19:22,904 --> 01:19:26,066
Malaria! Does she feel cold?

636
01:19:26,673 --> 01:19:30,575
- Does she get fever?
- No. Her stomach aches and vomits.

637
01:19:30,911 --> 01:19:32,707
Has she taken any medicine!

638
01:19:32,779 --> 01:19:37,614
No, she asked for pickles.
I give her.

639
01:19:41,620 --> 01:19:43,417
OK. I'll be going.

640
01:21:25,577 --> 01:21:28,443
Yamuna, you did not
express any wish at the temple?

641
01:21:30,948 --> 01:21:36,544
You want me to
announce my sin to the world?

642
01:21:38,655 --> 01:21:43,318
Be branded as a fallen woman?
Tarnish my father's name?

643
01:21:46,829 --> 01:21:50,457
Bring down the wrath
of society on me?

644
01:21:53,768 --> 01:21:56,293
But yet...

645
01:22:01,241 --> 01:22:05,802
No, I don't know anything.

646
01:22:08,481 --> 01:22:13,816
A relation in sin has no future.

647
01:22:23,327 --> 01:22:26,490
I'll find a way out.

648
01:22:26,764 --> 01:22:30,221
Yamuna, haven't seen you for ages.

649
01:22:36,605 --> 01:22:40,473
Look, she's entering
from the front door.

650
01:22:40,776 --> 01:22:43,642
This wouldn't have
happened if Guru were here.

651
01:22:53,286 --> 01:22:54,651
What happened?

652
01:22:56,957 --> 01:22:58,618
Shall I get the medicine?

653
01:23:00,826 --> 01:23:07,663
Evil times! Dooms day is coming.

654
01:23:18,475 --> 01:23:23,502
Master, I took you to be a gentleman.

655
01:23:23,713 --> 01:23:26,307
But you have betrayed.

656
01:23:29,619 --> 01:23:31,779
- Yamuna is very ill.
- Really?

657
01:23:31,853 --> 01:23:36,415
She is vomiting.
Isn't coming out of her room.

658
01:23:36,691 --> 01:23:38,214
Go and visit her.

659
01:23:51,971 --> 01:23:55,736
- What happened, Aunt?
- Evil times!

660
01:24:00,345 --> 01:24:01,777
What is it?

661
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:05,977
Guru's widowed daughter is pregnant.

662
01:24:07,551 --> 01:24:12,419
Drown yourself in shame.

663
01:24:18,694 --> 01:24:19,991
Sreekari.

664
01:24:21,297 --> 01:24:25,289
Manjunath! After a long time.

665
01:24:25,867 --> 01:24:28,529
I'm not here to exchange niceties.

666
01:24:29,370 --> 01:24:32,827
Why? I have hypocrisy.

667
01:24:34,341 --> 01:24:40,336
To say that I've come to
meet a long lost friend.

668
01:24:40,946 --> 01:24:43,278
Would be hypocrisy.

669
01:24:44,850 --> 01:24:49,309
Then you've come on
an important business.

670
01:24:50,422 --> 01:24:53,880
Strange! The one who
imparts knowledge to foreigners...

671
01:24:54,391 --> 01:24:56,188
...is himself so ignorant.

672
01:24:58,262 --> 01:25:02,561
Why don't you speak more clearly.

673
01:25:03,566 --> 01:25:05,466
You don't know of the...

674
01:25:06,336 --> 01:25:07,894
...evil things
happening in your Gurukul.

675
01:25:08,638 --> 01:25:09,831
What are you saying!

676
01:25:14,976 --> 01:25:17,569
I don't believe it.

677
01:25:18,946 --> 01:25:21,779
You should have
verified before accusing.

678
01:25:24,618 --> 01:25:27,313
I hate hypocrisy.

679
01:25:28,221 --> 01:25:30,382
Don't pretend to be ignorant of...

680
01:25:30,957 --> 01:25:32,754
...what the whole world knows.

681
01:25:32,825 --> 01:25:34,816
I'm not being a hypocrite.

682
01:25:35,227 --> 01:25:38,355
Then keep your eyes and ears open.

683
01:25:38,897 --> 01:25:41,660
And be prepared for the days to come.

684
01:25:55,579 --> 01:25:56,670
What are you saying?

685
01:25:58,514 --> 01:26:00,812
Last year you had learnt these verses.

686
01:26:03,618 --> 01:26:04,812
Speak with me.

687
01:26:06,421 --> 01:26:08,582
The one who wears a garland of snakes.

688
01:26:11,392 --> 01:26:13,257
The one whose mind's eye is open.

689
01:26:23,936 --> 01:26:25,028
Don't want coffee.

690
01:26:32,477 --> 01:26:33,603
Take it away.

691
01:26:34,279 --> 01:26:38,214
The one who smears
his body with ashes.

692
01:26:41,685 --> 01:26:46,678
Who is always pure, I bow to Him!

693
01:27:08,975 --> 01:27:12,433
That's all for today.
Learn it properly.

694
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:24,951
I understand your dilemma.

695
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:32,453
Udup Pandit is your relative.
He has take charge of your son.

696
01:27:32,696 --> 01:27:34,254
This is laudable.

697
01:27:35,365 --> 01:27:37,229
But will you spoil your son's life.

698
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:39,224
Because of your gratitude for him?

699
01:27:41,337 --> 01:27:42,770
Listen, Bhatt, listen.

700
01:27:44,806 --> 01:27:48,003
If there is so much
misconduct in the house of learning.

701
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:53,876
The students cannot grow
up with covert values.

702
01:27:54,948 --> 01:27:58,475
Remember, save your
morals to save yourself.

703
01:28:29,312 --> 01:28:32,303
Pack up your things.

704
01:28:32,848 --> 01:28:34,440
Your father has come to take you away.

705
01:28:37,853 --> 01:28:39,319
Haven't you heard?

706
01:28:52,766 --> 01:28:54,198
Enough of studies.

707
01:28:57,069 --> 01:29:00,163
What a house of learning!

708
01:29:19,922 --> 01:29:22,720
Why Shrikar! What's it aunt?

709
01:29:22,992 --> 01:29:25,323
Didn't go to Gurukul to teach.

710
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,352
No, I'll go now.

711
01:29:27,429 --> 01:29:30,660
- Then listen to me.
- Yes.

712
01:29:30,732 --> 01:29:34,394
Put a little more
increase in the fire today.

713
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:39,270
Why? That house is stinking.

714
01:29:42,408 --> 01:29:45,104
Don't show your temper.

715
01:29:45,278 --> 01:29:48,212
You will have a nephew
in a few months to come.

716
01:29:57,922 --> 01:29:59,082
Strange!

717
01:30:02,359 --> 01:30:06,454
Everybody is talking about it.

718
01:30:08,098 --> 01:30:09,861
Only I was ignorant.

719
01:30:12,167 --> 01:30:16,035
Yamuna? No!

720
01:30:18,706 --> 01:30:20,173
She can't do this.

721
01:30:22,009 --> 01:30:23,237
I don't believe it.

722
01:30:29,816 --> 01:30:33,979
And then, what's the proof?

723
01:30:35,287 --> 01:30:37,915
What proof do you and
your Brahmins Society have?

724
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:39,821
Facts don't need proofs.

725
01:30:43,361 --> 01:30:48,355
The seedling in
Yamuna's womb is the proof.

726
01:30:49,700 --> 01:30:51,759
How long will she even after that?

727
01:31:00,743 --> 01:31:03,974
How long will you
associate yourself...

728
01:31:04,045 --> 01:31:05,945
...with that house of sin?

729
01:31:07,415 --> 01:31:08,882
How long?

730
01:31:12,119 --> 01:31:13,677
Listen well.

731
01:31:14,455 --> 01:31:17,049
Your Gurukul is breaking up.

732
01:31:19,392 --> 01:31:22,225
Ganesh's father has taken him away.

733
01:31:23,229 --> 01:31:25,857
The others will also be removed soon.

734
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:30,929
And you're still vacillating.

735
01:31:34,673 --> 01:31:39,735
Always indecisive.

736
01:31:40,945 --> 01:31:43,970
That's your destiny.

737
01:31:56,825 --> 01:31:58,689
You're just the same.

738
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:01,194
Same laughter, same naughtiness.

739
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:04,931
Keep smiling like
this through your life.

740
01:32:05,933 --> 01:32:08,128
My blessings are with you.

741
01:32:12,372 --> 01:32:13,929
Where is Ganesh?

742
01:32:16,442 --> 01:32:18,342
His father has taken him away.

743
01:32:25,083 --> 01:32:26,846
This was bound to be.

744
01:32:28,253 --> 01:32:33,053
It leave you to your fate.

745
01:32:57,111 --> 01:33:00,136
I can't stand and watch
the disintegration...

746
01:33:00,213 --> 01:33:02,340
...of this institution.

747
01:33:05,885 --> 01:33:07,283
I won't be coming from tomorrow.

748
01:33:21,132 --> 01:33:23,964
This is the house
and Shastri is inside.

749
01:33:33,743 --> 01:33:36,075
- Where is Shastri?
- Why?

750
01:33:36,212 --> 01:33:39,009
- The landlord has called him.
- What for?

751
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:44,609
What do I know?
Shastri, come.

752
01:33:55,361 --> 01:33:57,056
Nanni, come.

753
01:33:58,698 --> 01:34:00,666
No, I won't leave Akka.

754
01:34:00,767 --> 01:34:02,324
Your dad has also been sent for.

755
01:34:02,401 --> 01:34:04,961
- I won't come.
- Go to hell.

756
01:34:43,303 --> 01:34:46,830
Akka, why are you so sad?

757
01:34:47,907 --> 01:34:50,068
I won't go away.

758
01:34:50,876 --> 01:34:52,776
I'll never leave you.

759
01:35:22,037 --> 01:35:23,664
It's me.

760
01:35:25,107 --> 01:35:26,334
Open the door.

761
01:35:28,943 --> 01:35:32,208
Alright, we'll meet
at the ruins tomorrow.

762
01:35:33,279 --> 01:35:35,076
I've made all arrangements.

763
01:35:35,915 --> 01:35:37,382
Every thing will be alright.

764
01:36:26,326 --> 01:36:28,293
- You're angry with your Akka?
- No.

765
01:36:28,361 --> 01:36:32,354
- You're angry with Nanni?
- No.

766
01:36:33,866 --> 01:36:36,129
- Want to listen to something?
- Yes.

767
01:36:53,650 --> 01:36:54,912
Want to hear again?

768
01:37:01,323 --> 01:37:04,292
- You like it?
- You like it?

769
01:37:25,044 --> 01:37:27,137
Nanni, Shastri is calling you.

770
01:37:27,213 --> 01:37:29,146
I won't go without asking Akka.

771
01:37:32,917 --> 01:37:34,009
He is not coming.

772
01:37:34,953 --> 01:37:37,250
- Come with me.
- Akka's not home.

773
01:37:37,321 --> 01:37:39,289
I'll take you to her.

774
01:37:47,096 --> 01:37:48,996
Let me close the door.

775
01:37:51,100 --> 01:37:54,660
Your father is
returning soon. Before that...

776
01:37:54,736 --> 01:37:56,101
Where are we going?

777
01:37:57,839 --> 01:38:00,068
I will go first. You'll follow me.

778
01:38:00,674 --> 01:38:03,040
All alone an unknown place?

779
01:38:03,110 --> 01:38:05,772
It's nearby.
In the untouchables village.

780
01:38:06,780 --> 01:38:11,113
He's an expert.
He'll rid you of your sin smoothly.

781
01:38:12,318 --> 01:38:15,912
- Your sin?
- This is not the time to argue.

782
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:24,286
Carefully.

783
01:38:34,304 --> 01:38:36,329
This is the only way left.

784
01:38:37,007 --> 01:38:40,066
Feticide! That's all you thought of.

785
01:38:42,378 --> 01:38:44,710
I didn't know you were such a coward.

786
01:38:48,917 --> 01:38:50,714
I'll take you to Akka.

787
01:38:52,887 --> 01:38:55,320
I'll show you super ghost.

788
01:39:01,093 --> 01:39:03,391
I had thought,
you'll take me far away.

789
01:39:03,663 --> 01:39:04,994
Oh, it's Akka.

790
01:39:06,265 --> 01:39:07,892
Watch quietly.

791
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,258
This is the super ghost
in the grab of the school teacher.

792
01:39:15,974 --> 01:39:17,065
Snake!

793
01:39:18,108 --> 01:39:21,100
This is a watersnake. Harmless.

794
01:39:26,416 --> 01:39:28,247
It's going towards Akka.

795
01:39:35,591 --> 01:39:36,819
Shastri, come.

796
01:39:38,026 --> 01:39:42,724
We'll be back.
You be here. Don't move.

797
01:39:48,068 --> 01:39:49,899
She has polluted the temple.

798
01:39:50,604 --> 01:39:53,004
God must be angry with her.

799
01:39:53,340 --> 01:39:55,170
That is why the snake has come out.

800
01:39:56,075 --> 01:39:59,135
This is the right punishment for her.

801
01:40:00,813 --> 01:40:03,007
Let's go to Ranga. It'll be great fun.

802
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:12,086
Akka, Snake!

803
01:40:23,833 --> 01:40:25,925
I'll chop off her head. Where is she?

804
01:40:31,973 --> 01:40:33,564
Let's hunt her out.

805
01:42:35,647 --> 01:42:37,580
Koga, have you seen Akka?

806
01:42:39,117 --> 01:42:40,880
What happened?

807
01:42:41,586 --> 01:42:43,781
Akka's not at home.

808
01:42:44,921 --> 01:42:49,119
Went to the ruins in the morning.
Now she has gone off.

809
01:42:49,693 --> 01:42:51,126
- She's not home?
- No.

810
01:42:54,096 --> 01:42:55,791
I'm feeling scared.

811
01:42:59,901 --> 01:43:01,129
Look. She's there.

812
01:43:07,608 --> 01:43:09,098
I don't want to live.

813
01:43:12,813 --> 01:43:14,973
It's a snakepit, Akka.

814
01:43:28,226 --> 01:43:33,754
Amma come home with me.

815
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:39,063
Noone'll do any thing.

816
01:43:39,903 --> 01:43:46,171
No God or ghost will harm
you Brahmins, I don't know...

817
01:43:47,876 --> 01:43:50,106
Amma, don't cry.

818
01:43:50,979 --> 01:43:53,004
No one will do any harm.

819
01:43:53,214 --> 01:43:58,584
I'll not spare him...
I'm always with you.

820
01:44:46,862 --> 01:44:53,266
Eat something. What shall I
tell your father when he returns?

821
01:44:54,101 --> 01:44:56,534
Don't feel scared. I'll be coming.

822
01:44:57,570 --> 01:45:02,064
If any body knocks,
don't open the door.

823
01:45:02,608 --> 01:45:04,735
I will be taking rounds at night.

824
01:45:27,229 --> 01:45:29,288
Akka where are you going?

825
01:45:31,333 --> 01:45:35,325
- Do you want me to live?
- Yes.

826
01:45:37,572 --> 01:45:39,130
Then come with me.

827
01:46:22,811 --> 01:46:26,611
I am scared.
Shall we take Koga along?

828
01:47:20,228 --> 01:47:22,889
You sit there. You come with me.

829
01:47:34,140 --> 01:47:36,767
Yamuna, you're so late.

830
01:47:45,716 --> 01:47:48,879
Lie down here.

831
01:48:00,029 --> 01:48:01,690
Nobody to enter.

832
01:48:11,773 --> 01:48:13,172
Drink the medicine.

833
01:48:45,135 --> 01:48:46,795
What'll happen now?

834
01:48:47,003 --> 01:48:49,028
Should've thought of that earlier.

835
01:48:50,606 --> 01:48:53,768
Very difficult work,
anything may happen.

836
01:49:34,811 --> 01:49:37,905
Where's Amma? Inside.

837
01:49:47,555 --> 01:49:48,681
What's she doing inside?

838
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:52,053
What else? A Brahmin's
sin is being washed.

839
01:49:55,028 --> 01:49:56,757
I won't spare you, Master.

840
01:49:58,232 --> 01:49:59,756
Nanni, Come.

841
01:49:59,833 --> 01:50:01,926
No. I won't leave Akka behind.

842
01:50:09,041 --> 01:50:11,031
He's fled from the village.

843
01:50:18,282 --> 01:50:19,715
You're drinking too much, Pandit.

844
01:50:20,718 --> 01:50:24,984
I'm drinking the elixir.

845
01:50:27,157 --> 01:50:29,591
Beware of my curse.

846
01:50:41,035 --> 01:50:43,162
What such a young celibate?

847
01:52:07,311 --> 01:52:13,306
<i>My soul is a follower of Shiva...</i>

848
01:52:13,716 --> 01:52:18,380
<i>...My breath is a guest in my body.</i>

849
01:52:19,055 --> 01:52:24,651
<i>My daily routine his worship
My sleep is like trance.</i>

850
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:35,991
<i>My walk is like pilgrimage
My life is my worship to you.</i>

851
01:52:55,620 --> 01:52:57,520
Boatman, take it home.

852
01:53:07,997 --> 01:53:10,261
What had happened? Come.

853
01:53:11,600 --> 01:53:13,033
Be careful.

854
01:53:17,005 --> 01:53:18,563
Sit down.

855
01:53:24,745 --> 01:53:27,373
I'm scared. Let's go from here.

856
01:53:29,082 --> 01:53:31,208
- Where?
- Gurukul.

857
01:53:35,154 --> 01:53:36,951
It is lost to me.

858
01:53:38,156 --> 01:53:41,557
Then come to my house,
We'll go by boat.

859
01:53:42,127 --> 01:53:47,029
My mother'll love you;
give you good food.

860
01:53:48,699 --> 01:53:50,530
You'll like it there.

861
01:53:52,303 --> 01:53:56,705
Nanni, will you remember me?

862
01:53:56,973 --> 01:53:58,463
Yes. Now come.

863
01:54:15,423 --> 01:54:17,686
All the Brahmins have been
called for a meeting today.

864
01:54:22,395 --> 01:54:24,624
After all, Brahmins have their honour.

865
01:54:36,641 --> 01:54:40,701
Sir, it's me, Koga.

866
01:54:43,714 --> 01:54:47,342
I saved her from wild animals,
from snakes.

867
01:54:47,416 --> 01:54:49,577
But couldn't save her from a Brahmin.

868
01:54:55,357 --> 01:54:58,224
Where's the unfortunate
girl? In Parabhu's hut.

869
01:55:03,597 --> 01:55:06,327
The school teacher has betrayed her.

870
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:09,368
He has fled.

871
01:55:11,337 --> 01:55:12,702
Now I'll get her home.

872
01:55:15,074 --> 01:55:17,701
I'll go and get her.

873
01:55:18,543 --> 01:55:21,307
Then my responsibility will be over.

874
01:55:22,014 --> 01:55:25,176
No. She will not step into this house.

875
01:55:27,084 --> 01:55:31,111
I shouldn't have brought her
home when she became a widow.

876
01:55:32,522 --> 01:55:35,116
Then where will she go?

877
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:38,489
Wherever her destiny takes her.

878
01:55:39,329 --> 01:55:40,590
She's your daughter.

879
01:55:42,298 --> 01:55:47,326
There's no father, nor mother
Nor friend nor benefactor...

880
01:55:47,403 --> 01:55:50,735
...No son nor daughter.

881
01:55:51,606 --> 01:55:53,597
Don't tell me these verses.

882
01:55:54,008 --> 01:55:56,475
I've been hearing
them since childhood.

883
01:56:02,516 --> 01:56:05,006
All useless.

884
01:56:05,251 --> 01:56:06,650
Brahmins!

885
01:56:07,486 --> 01:56:11,546
Save your girl first,
then protect your religion.

886
01:56:12,090 --> 01:56:13,318
Brahmin!

887
01:56:13,458 --> 01:56:19,020
Brahmin are supposed to
control their senses...

888
01:56:19,129 --> 01:56:26,160
...their anger their desire.

889
01:56:54,461 --> 01:56:57,020
Why have I been called here?

890
01:56:57,463 --> 01:57:00,057
Telling my friend, telling.

891
01:57:01,367 --> 01:57:07,771
The time of reckoning has come.

892
01:57:09,540 --> 01:57:13,168
Today your Guru will have to
pronounce his decision...

893
01:57:13,243 --> 01:57:14,642
...to the assembly.

894
01:57:16,313 --> 01:57:20,772
I know you don't see
eye to eye with him.

895
01:57:21,450 --> 01:57:25,045
But why make an issue out
of his personal tragedy?

896
01:57:25,621 --> 01:57:33,527
A leader doesn't have a personal life.

897
01:57:34,229 --> 01:57:38,062
You had promised not to
drag Yamuna into this.

898
01:57:40,134 --> 01:57:43,967
Every promise cannot be kept.

899
01:57:45,738 --> 01:57:48,263
You too had promised to
keep the Gurukul running.

900
01:57:49,642 --> 01:57:51,575
Didn't your abandon it yourself?

901
01:57:52,611 --> 01:57:54,044
That was trick played by you.

902
01:57:58,050 --> 01:58:00,984
But the decision was yours.

903
01:59:03,573 --> 01:59:05,097
What it is?

904
01:59:12,647 --> 01:59:14,308
I couldn't save the Gurukul.

905
01:59:15,183 --> 01:59:18,174
You didn't do anything wrong.

906
01:59:19,687 --> 01:59:22,019
I know everything.

907
01:59:23,356 --> 01:59:27,019
The land lord's and
Manjunath's comments've been...

908
01:59:27,093 --> 01:59:29,527
...reaching my ears.

909
01:59:31,630 --> 01:59:33,359
I'm worried about Yamuna.

910
01:59:33,932 --> 01:59:37,368
Everyone's worried in his own way.

911
01:59:39,003 --> 01:59:43,133
Man proposes, God disposes.

912
01:59:46,010 --> 01:59:50,571
The Brahmin community is
waiting for your decision.

913
01:59:58,687 --> 02:00:01,451
I'll surely give my decision.

914
02:00:03,124 --> 02:00:05,490
Every body will know...

915
02:00:06,661 --> 02:00:09,061
...the stuff I am made of.

916
02:00:10,264 --> 02:00:15,668
And realise how I've
safeguarded the society's interest.

917
02:00:16,503 --> 02:00:19,494
I know what they expect from me.

918
02:00:22,375 --> 02:00:24,343
I feel scared by all this.

919
02:00:24,709 --> 02:00:28,236
Don't fear, conquer it.

920
02:00:29,347 --> 02:00:30,974
This is what I have been teaching you.

921
02:00:32,349 --> 02:00:38,219
All your uncertainties and
dilemmas will be over...

922
02:00:39,223 --> 02:00:46,924
When you hear my decision.
You'll take my message to them.

923
02:00:52,301 --> 02:00:54,929
I give you this responsibility.

924
02:01:00,208 --> 02:01:05,110
Forgive me, but I won't
take this responsibility.

925
02:01:06,179 --> 02:01:10,582
It's not due to lack of courage.

926
02:01:11,450 --> 02:01:15,284
I have the courage to disobey you.

927
02:01:16,355 --> 02:01:19,414
I won't speak your language any more.

928
02:01:23,127 --> 02:01:25,288
I'll speak the
luggage of my inner voice.

929
02:01:26,130 --> 02:01:28,654
My decision in final.

930
02:01:29,933 --> 02:01:32,333
We've been using empty words.

931
02:01:33,503 --> 02:01:35,299
Those who sacrifice innocent women...

932
02:01:35,371 --> 02:01:36,963
...Have been called the
highest of human beings.

933
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,907
No. I refute all that.

934
02:01:43,378 --> 02:01:45,573
I disown your teachings.

935
02:01:48,083 --> 02:01:49,640
If you can, wish me success.

936
02:01:50,351 --> 02:01:53,184
...In my attempt to
lead a normal human life.

937
02:01:53,487 --> 02:01:56,081
...outside the
bounds of dead traditions.

938
02:01:56,590 --> 02:01:58,489
This will be my new initiation.

939
02:02:24,948 --> 02:02:29,907
Nanni, come out.
Your learning is over.

940
02:02:31,954 --> 02:02:34,354
Are you Nanni's father? Yes.

941
02:02:36,057 --> 02:02:40,187
You've come too late
Nanni has gone to Parabhu's.

942
02:02:40,261 --> 02:02:41,626
Gone where?

943
02:02:43,430 --> 02:02:48,026
To Parabhu's
in the village of the untouchables.

944
02:03:02,080 --> 02:03:08,917
You all know why we
have gathered here today.

945
02:03:14,057 --> 02:03:15,547
Akka! Father's come.

946
02:03:15,925 --> 02:03:18,655
Come with me. My mother
will take good care of you.

947
02:03:19,195 --> 02:03:22,061
We'll take her along. No!

948
02:03:22,631 --> 02:03:26,624
I won't leave her behind.
Akka, come with me.

949
02:03:30,905 --> 02:03:33,499
Leave me! Won't go without her.

950
02:03:53,291 --> 02:03:57,193
Should we allow such
aberrations to grow in our Society?

951
02:03:58,996 --> 02:04:02,487
If not, we must retribute.

952
02:04:04,234 --> 02:04:06,896
Come, shreekar.

953
02:04:10,339 --> 02:04:12,000
The Guru is coming, I hope.

954
02:04:12,141 --> 02:04:14,075
- Ask him!
- Why?

955
02:04:14,910 --> 02:04:17,901
Usually you represent him!

956
02:04:18,413 --> 02:04:20,904
I am not his messenger.

957
02:04:22,917 --> 02:04:25,214
Oh, that means you are on my side.

958
02:04:26,019 --> 02:04:28,283
Listen to me carefully.

959
02:04:30,957 --> 02:04:32,891
As soon as I become
the head priest...

960
02:04:32,959 --> 02:04:34,586
...I'll appoint you my deputy.

961
02:04:37,196 --> 02:04:38,492
Sir has come.

962
02:05:21,368 --> 02:05:22,892
I am aware...

963
02:05:24,438 --> 02:05:27,565
...that you all are
eagerly awaiting my decision.

964
02:05:28,674 --> 02:05:32,075
After studying the
scriptures and contemplating...

965
02:05:32,310 --> 02:05:35,404
...on the Vedic norms.

966
02:05:36,247 --> 02:05:42,378
I've come to this conclusion.

967
02:05:45,155 --> 02:05:47,487
I am informing all of you that...

968
02:05:48,624 --> 02:05:51,457
...my widowed daughter.

969
02:05:52,361 --> 02:05:55,057
...is a sinner.

970
02:05:56,064 --> 02:06:01,161
She has not only established
an immoral relationship...

971
02:06:01,570 --> 02:06:04,060
...with an unknown outsider.

972
02:06:04,538 --> 02:06:08,474
But has also committed
the crime of foeticide.

973
02:06:10,578 --> 02:06:16,982
After considering all
the angles of the case.

974
02:06:18,650 --> 02:06:20,515
...in you august presence.

975
02:06:23,455 --> 02:06:27,322
I declare her as dead.

976
02:06:27,391 --> 02:06:29,450
Fair and just!

977
02:06:32,563 --> 02:06:33,927
Attention, friends!

978
02:06:36,132 --> 02:06:38,430
Before you all accept the judgement,

979
02:06:39,202 --> 02:06:45,106
I, Srikar Upadhyay,
refute it publicily.

980
02:06:46,108 --> 02:06:47,439
This is not religion.

981
02:06:48,010 --> 02:06:52,036
This is a sacrifice of a young
girl at the alter petty politics.

982
02:06:54,215 --> 02:06:58,617
Whatever Udup Pandit
declared is not faith.

983
02:07:00,254 --> 02:07:03,690
Faith is mercy,
tolerance, broad mindedness.

984
02:07:04,991 --> 02:07:07,118
And today, in this metting...

985
02:07:07,927 --> 02:07:11,260
...Udup Pandit is
trampling over all that.

986
02:07:13,098 --> 02:07:18,229
You are not only
sentensing an unfortunate woman.

987
02:07:18,703 --> 02:07:21,933
But you are giving a
death sentence to...

988
02:07:22,006 --> 02:07:23,974
...the entire Brahmin Community.

989
02:07:25,643 --> 02:07:27,577
I boycott this assembly.

990
02:07:36,018 --> 02:07:38,953
No need to stay in such a Gurukul.

991
02:07:39,321 --> 02:07:40,652
Come quickly.

992
02:07:43,291 --> 02:07:45,259
We must leave the wretched place.

993
02:07:45,326 --> 02:07:49,353
Koga, take care of Akka.

994
02:07:51,464 --> 02:07:52,624
Don't mention the slut's name.

995
02:07:56,002 --> 02:07:57,560
She's polluted you.

996
02:07:58,004 --> 02:07:59,664
You'll have to be purified.

997
02:08:02,107 --> 02:08:04,473
Take care of Akka, please.

998
02:08:05,311 --> 02:08:07,608
Koga, take care of Akka.

999
02:08:16,153 --> 02:08:17,415
What high hopes I had!

1000
02:08:34,636 --> 02:08:38,093
Koga, take care of Akka.

1001
02:09:33,086 --> 02:09:37,147
May your soul be free.
