An incident that took place in Kaitheri...

This is a paddy field in the northern
region about 43 years back.

3
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:55,047
This is Sahadevan in the future he
will be known as 'Kaitheri Sahadevan'

4
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,683
This is his Father'Kaitheri Chathu'

5
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:03,094
A bold dynamic warrior
of RPIM during those days.

6
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:10,464
This is the dead body of
Chathu's brother 'Ammbu'...

7
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,968
...which means, Sahadevan's
Father's brother.

8

comrade Ammbu's dead body.

12

He is heading straight
towards here, for sure.

13

Comrade what is he really up to?

14
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:08,491
Comrade what is this
nonsense all about?

15
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:10,585
Keep the mouth shut!

16
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,625

18
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,694
Mustn't I exhibit this nonsense?

19
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,839
Then I'm not a human
being neither not a Marxist!

20
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,066
Then no use of moving
ahead with this party's flag!

21
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,242
Don't utter anything about party!

22
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,141
I will!

23
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:32,878
On party's instruction he had sowed
the seeds in the Adikandda paddy field.

24
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,649
As per party's instruction he
had hosted a flag over there.

The party had told to do everything,
and told, will manage the rest.

For each and every chop, will
be returned back as three!

For each and every head
sliced off, will be redeemed!

32
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,836
That is the history of this movement.

33
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:00,840
If it were to complain it to police
what is the difference between...

34
00:05:00,933 --> 00:05:05,575
...that 'red flag' and the red cloth,
used for funeral rituals?

35
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,982
Chathu, this is no time
for emotional outburst.

36
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:08,984
We must behave in a balanced...

37
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:13,080
You! Must not talk, the blood
which is shed is mine, not yours'.

38
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,021
I'm the first person who
raised a red flag in this land.

39
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,124
On that day, those who
saluted the flag, were one blood.

I tell this, so that
everyone listens carefully!

That is to tell about

00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,582
...in the homeland,
there are no workers left.

169
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:11,707
Comrade, that Suresh is totally
mad, on becoming a debtor.

170
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,051
Had come here, said
something and all and gone back.

171
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:16,985
Comrade your phone is ringing.

172
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,117
I'm there in a minute,
just dropped in at Ante's shop.

173
00:21:29,755 --> 00:21:32,463
Soman, where is that lunatic Jayan?

174
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:34,800
He is standing over there.

175
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:42,562
<i>xxx-Team Splash-xxx</i>

176
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,835
Move away and smoke,
do you want to do in front of him?

177
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,373
Tell them to close all the shops.

178
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,110
Put on those buttons!

179
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:26,850
Young tender lads well versed in English
will command fire, charge, on the march.

180
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:28,618
But the actual situation is not like that.

181
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,494
When the beating starts he can just
blow his whistle and simply push off.

182
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,220
We are the actual ones
who are suffering here.

183
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,422
So before the beating starts chew
some 'meeta pan' in the mouth...

184
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:38,792
...and smoke to instill
muscles in the body.

185
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:41,101
<i>And uh- bottoms so that
wind touches the chest.</i>

186
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,197
The drum must be pelted with stone
so that the drummer gets the medal.

187
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:48,410
He knows that, so even if he sees
this, he is never going to mind this.

188
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,713
Brother you go ahead, I'll come.

189
00:23:00,946 --> 00:23:02,892
Hey! You are disabled and
why do you want to stand here?

190
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:06,892
Hey! You clear off everything from
here, no need to buy any of these.

191
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,226
After some time, everything
will be lying on the road.

192
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:10,995
I'll will bring them there,
when I come to see sister...

193
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,090
...are you having any exams tomorrow?

194
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,696
Just hold your tongue!
Play with your equals!

195
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,164
Comrade are you fine?

196
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:23,103
If you demand more money, other
than the meter...Don't you know me?

197
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,947
If you fuss with YFI!
If you fuss with YFI!

198
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,748
You must cover your face,
don't make any mistakes.

199
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:46,267
This is the document, I had told you. For
Chembadd dam's maintenance work.

200
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,929
And for replacing the turbine...And
for renovating Chek dams outer wall...

201
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:52,541
...Copy of the contract with
the Canadian Government.

202
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,169
This is the direct fonlvard send by
company's ex-auditor, send to me.

203
00:23:58,837 --> 00:24:03,877
Had fetched 3.75 crores as
commission, the contract is on 2007.

204
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:07,522
Did the money go to party fund?
- No idea.

205
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,626
The first transfer was
to an account in UAE.

206
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:20,133
YFI Sindbad! We had
seen this many a times!

207
00:24:20,258 --> 00:24:21,566
Who is the main signatory?

208
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:25,201
An IAS officer named Mohana
Krishnan. He is on suspension now.

209
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,170
Minister was Basi is it not?

210
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:30,979
Yes, for sure, but the money
was routed, not for him.

211
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:32,176
Then who?

212
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:33,508
Who else?

213
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,749
Kaitheri Sahadevan' Sindbad!
Kaitheri Sahadevan' Sindbad!

214
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:44,127
We will never run back, scared
on hearing the sound of boots...

215
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:49,029
...or on seeing the stars
on the shoulders!

216
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,997
What is the surety that
it is com rade Sahadevan?

217
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,163
The account holder at
UAE is a beenamee of Kaitheri.

218
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,672
It is not ethical to give this,
without cross checking.

219
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,451
This is all cross checked by all
means, this is concrete information.

220
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:32,408
Is this not that lunatic
SI near comrade's house?

221
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:38,410
You will not have Onam!
(Celebration in Kerala)

222
00:25:40,639 --> 00:25:41,982
This is all my Onam!

223
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,713
This is not like speaking,
when within the party.

224
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,983
You and Suresh had done a
mistake, on starting...

225
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,718
...a newspaper, after quitting from party.

226
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:53,728
Party alone is not Communism,
Party alone is not Marxism.

227
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,597
Comrade is this
what you call com munism?

228
00:25:56,855 --> 00:26:00,928
Your personal grudge towards comrade
Sahadevan, I'm very well aware of it.

229
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:03,305
This is not connected with that.

230
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:08,736
May be not. But in a Marxist
party it is not Marxism alone.

231
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,544
Few speak in favor of Leninism.

232
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:12,911
Few speak like Gober Chov.

233
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,208
There will be few Stalinist also.

234
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:16,645
Among these, where do you belong?

235
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,018
L...I'm this!

<i>xxx-Team Splash-xxx</i>

237
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,453
What you have to tell is true...it
must be told at the right place Aliyar!

238
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,422
If communism and
Marxism has got a voice here...

239
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:56,924
...it will reach out to the world only
through RPM, for the time being.

240
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,993
Still now it is a big mango-tree
giving fruits and shelter to many...

241
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:04,192
...and there are lot of
weeds too...Lots of them.

242
00:27:04,756 --> 00:27:06,702
It is not an excuse to chop
off the mango- tree at its base!

243
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:11,800
Che Guevara Roy, what a
brilliant speech in the olden days?

244
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:19,607
Aliyar you go, I'll cometo house
of Suresh will discuss in detail.

245
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:23,549
Town was ditched in blood
by the ruling party's alleys...

246
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:26,088
...barbarian police <i>as</i> commented
by comrade Kaitheri Sahadevan.

247
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,181
He commented as,
our history is blood for, blood!

248
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:33,319
We will repay for each and every
drop of blood shed by RPM children.

249
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,392
How is your husband now?

250
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,827
How is the teaching at the
orphanage and social work going on?

251
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,698
Isn't he Che Guevara, won't sit idle.

252
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,769
Classes are going on at
orphanage, he is fully engaged.

253
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,940
Then as you know, lot of medical issues,
yesterday there was a swelling in the leg.

254
00:27:56,207 --> 00:28:00,622
BP is slightly problematic,
must take him to hospital.

255
00:28:01,546 --> 00:28:06,188
Che Guevara Roy had met him
twice at the college...Real fire work!

256
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:09,430
He is lucky, Allaida March is with him.

257
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,931
Not only Allaida March...

258
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,161
...both Hilda Gelada and Allaida
March, is it two in one.

259
00:28:13,258 --> 00:28:14,931
Hilda and Allaida March who are they?

260
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:19,341
Don't know these names,
HOD, PKG Memorial College.

261
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,078
Lal Salam comrade, can expect a
change from this guest lecture position.

262
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,178
Had submitted all the certificates.

263
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,476
Will be regularized soon, as per
the information from higher ups.

264
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:30,582
Okay sir.

265
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,049
No payment for over time.
Hare Krishna.

266
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,318
Off day is as per the whims and fancies
of the management. Hare Krishna.

267
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,495
I saw your police man on TV,
What kind of beating he is giving?

268
00:28:42,654 --> 00:28:45,897
We all respect the kind
hearted loving Am ma...

269
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,836
...but there are few vanquishing
Am ma's stature and fame.

270
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,536
Who commits roughness,
under the cover of Am ma.

271
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,341
All we have to say to them. ls just
by wearing a saffron you can't be a saint.

272
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,115
I'll wind up my speech
with these words.

273
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:04,881
Also by congratulating our
beloved opposition leader...

274
00:29:04,976 --> 00:29:07,149
...who stood by us Comrade SR.

275
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,724
Now comrade SR will talk to you.

Where are you now?
- I'm...Here...

279
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:26,032
Still after the tail of that nurse, is it not?

280
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:28,469
No doubt why people call you mad.

281

Lightening inspection at the quarters,
Kuttan had told me, you go fast, run!

00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,426
I had given you what you
wanted, then why this ditching?

333
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,025
The ones who must be succumb
to trials must be put to trials.

334
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:57,162
Then only we will
get what we need.

335
00:34:57,962 --> 00:35:00,067
Is this a dialogue in serial
or is it, what you told me?

336
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,472
Only to you.

337
00:35:04,202 --> 00:35:05,545
Sir...What do you want now?

338
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:14,555
That...I'll tell you later. For the
time being have you escaped?

339
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,215
I know how to escape.

340
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:22,331
I know, all yourware bouts. Even if
it is bribe, there should be a limit.

341
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:25,900
After a situation
nothing can be done.

342
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:29,129
After ten years of this 'kakki'
still I'm getting rupees 12,000.

343
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:32,934
Rupees 12,000 when
did it decline to this extend?

344
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,568
Got two suspensions, on buying four
sack of rice, everything will be over.

345
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,274
The price of petrol and gas
is shooting up as rocket.

346
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,516
Yes indeed rocket!
What to do now?

347
00:35:50,748 --> 00:35:53,490
There are three types of
ladies who travel in a scooter.

348
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:56,325
First, they will hold on stomach,

349
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,530
under the pretext that I and
my husband are still on love.

350
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,967
Then the second type,
they will cling on shoulders.

351
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:06,999
Which means this is my man, for
the time being this is enough...

352
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:08,804
piece of knowledge.

353
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:12,073
Then the third type,
they will cling on thighs,

354
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:16,345
which means my
husband is my dearest one.

355
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:20,512
Apart from this, there is a fourth
type, will not touch anywhere.

356
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,990
Which means I have
other men apart from you.

357
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:33,124
That is the matter of husbands.
Yes it is. It ought to be.

358
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:41,570
One packet of bread.

359
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:46,077
Comrade whatever you
say, we must publish this.

360
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,877
We must be the first to publish this.

361
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,975
The main reason to
start this newspaper...

362
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:53,453
is to bring these
kind of things to light.

363
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:57,285
Not for calling Sindabad for them,
after going out from party.

364
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,986
Are you doing all this
to improve the party?

365
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:01,323
Do you think the other way?

366
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,632
Doing all these against Kaitheri
Sahadevan from the outside,

367
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,500
I believe it is out
of your right intentions.

368
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,868
But in action it will turn
out to be the opposite.

369
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,137
If we disclose it through this paper,

370
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,080
then it will be initially
taken over by bourgeois...

371
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,243
<i>newspapers like Malayala Rama.</i>

372
00:37:24,041 --> 00:37:26,487
In effect it will be like giving
them sickle and hammer.

373
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,954
And let party to be sliced.

374
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,626
Comrade you just get rid of
this study class kind of language.

375
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:35,288
Our newspaper is
only read by 2,500 people.

376
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:37,799
When the price rise of
petrol and gas is written...

377
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,101
Children you go
outside and play! Hey Deepa!

378
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,204
Can't increase the circulation,

379
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:47,935
- just by giving the petrol and
gas price rise in the front page.

380
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,545
Not only that what we
are telling is truth is also.

381
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,542
When Kaitheri says
I'm the party and party is me.

382
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:54,810
Should we keep silence,
after hearing all this?

383
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,442
To outburst all this, the main
reason for quitting the party.

384
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,712
If Malayala Rama
undertakes this, let them do it,

385
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,222
- let everyone know
there is a newspaper like this.

386
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:03,518
I must do what we can,

387
00:38:03,648 --> 00:38:07,790
I left my home and home
land just because of Sahadevan.

388
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:11,857
I was thrown out from party, on
speaking against him in a LC meeting.

389
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,232
I came here, because I couldn't
do anything in the native place.

390
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:18,339
On coming here I came to
know all are cowards here!

391
00:38:19,263 --> 00:38:22,540
As long as he is in this party, no
communism is going to happen here.

392
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:24,805
Look man!

393
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,576
Lemon and eggs are over here,
will you not go out and bring them.

394
00:38:27,705 --> 00:38:30,345
Comrade do you know the
amount of debt I have now?

395
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:32,648
This house and shop
everything is pledged.

396
00:38:32,843 --> 00:38:35,323
Ready to take u p
whatever it may be!

397
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,491
I'll just smoke and come.

398
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:45,530
Comrade you tell, is it not the time
that we show little more courage?

399
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:57,538
Comrade Roy must talk to him,

400
00:38:57,735 --> 00:39:00,272
- for so many days had been
talking about several things.

401
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:03,381
I'm scared ever since
he had quit the party.

402
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:06,520
Three or four days before group of
four men came and threatened.

403
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:07,884
I have not told anything.

404
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,993
When comrade says,
will listen. Can you talk?

405
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:15,093
This children and me
will be home-less.

406
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,725
Can you tell him to live on with
possession what you have?

407
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:21,528
I'll talk.

408
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:27,226
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

409
00:39:40,845 --> 00:39:41,789
Come.

410
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:49,495
This couragemBecomes a courage,
when it is slightly mixed with fear.

411
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:55,229
By giving this, and
something happens to you,

412
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,270
- have you thought what
will happen next?

413
00:39:58,129 --> 00:39:59,403
You?

414
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,504
We have got police
and army in here.

415
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,871
Notjust simply running a newspaper,
but sometimes should be read also.

416
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:07,580
You keep quite!

417
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:11,948
What will you do?

418
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:13,583
III-

419
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,989
Will you listen to me, when I tell
you a matter'? Do you trust me?

420
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,225
It has to be discussed
within the party circuits.

421
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,526
Party men must know this.
Is that all what you want?

422
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:33,666
Enough...But. Suresh you tell.

423
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:38,775
Enough...But to run the newspaper.

424
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,646
I'll go and meet comrade
SR, tell him the matter,

425
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,911
he is a straight forward person.

426
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:51,822
Will do as the comrade says.
SR...He will fish out in muddy water!

427
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,828
Do you trust me? I'll go and talk.

428
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:02,968
Won't trust SR but will obey you,
comrade. Like always, will listen to

429
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,731
...comrade Che Guevara Roy!

430
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,800
<i>Satya m Audios</i>

431
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:39,894
Where ever you are? I'll come till
I know the Father of that child.

432
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,128
I'll beat you.

433
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:50,906
If you can do anything, do it now. I
must leave this place at the earliest.

434
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:56,476
Had spoken to Jaison,
tomorrow we will go and meet.

435
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,484
But that guy will ask money.

436
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:02,113
Money is not at all a problem, will
give whatever we have in hand.

437
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,246
It seems that next month...

438
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:05,090
Mathews will be
released from hospital,

439
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,695
must not wait for a single minute.

440
00:43:07,851 --> 00:43:09,694
Then what about that police officer'?

441
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,890
He is mad!

442
00:43:11,055 --> 00:43:15,333
I have not told him to come
after me. They are all preverts!

443
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:20,706
For the time being I need
him, if I can't go abroad,

444
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,506
- to live in this place I must
have a company of a male.

445
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:27,082
Or else Mathews will
kill me and my son.

446
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:30,651
If you fry forgetting the pot,
the pot will also get burned.

447
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:33,244
- If not, will make to burn.

448
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,447
What does that mean?

449
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,252
Every time he is
saying the same thing,

450
00:43:37,381 --> 00:43:39,861
if you touch my children
<i>I will</i> also touch back.

451
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,929
Then within the language, it will be
intermixed that way and this way.

452
00:43:43,087 --> 00:43:46,864
See, he is real mad guy,
slashed in front of the camera.

453
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:49,301
Now they will wait for a chance.

454
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:50,995
Who cares, silly?

455
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,909
Hallo is he there inside?

456
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:59,680
<i>Hey Jayan, lunatic Jayan!</i>

457
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:02,647
Who is lunatic? Whom
had you called lunatic?

458
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:04,775
Are you trying to play smart?

459
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,291
Just for a joke buddy...Cool!

460
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:11,892
What is this?

461
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:18,228
Two things, one
Gopalan Kutty vls Kerala.

462
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:21,335
That file has to be plucked
out by someone in vigilance.

463
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:25,736
Then this is Anish, had
acted in movies in a small way.

464
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,606
- Introduce him to SP Bilal,
for getting an entry in serials.

465
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,915
Buddy our advocate
Preman will come there,

466
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:49,191
he wants some file on vigilance.
He is very close to me.

467
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,994
What? Money?
How much? 2,500!

468
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:02,074
Take 3,000.

469
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,337
What 3,000? Indeed
day light robbery!

470
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,025
You give this to him.

471
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,127
Do you want to play this with me?

472
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:20,662
If you want the material,
you go there.

473
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:26,899
Do you have photo with you?
Yes sir.

474
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:27,525
Take.

475
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,065
You go, <i>I will</i> give to him.

476
00:45:38,469 --> 00:45:39,243
Shall I go?

477
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:43,012
Can you beat in normal way?
I'm as old as to become your Father.

478
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:43,845
Are you calling on my Father'?

479
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,580
Father! I mean I'm
aged to become your Father.

480
00:45:47,044 --> 00:45:48,387
Oh! Like that.

481
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,221
What kind of a person is he?

482
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:52,749
His Father was the
line man in the current office.

483
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,095
His Father was the
line man in the current office.

484
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,598
A person who didn't
know how to live.

485
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:00,531
A movie freak!

486
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:05,266
Will take me and daughter to all the
movies of Jayan and Sukumaran.

487
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:07,935
Then came a movie named
'Angaddi'(The market)

488
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:11,444
-took me and my daughter...

489
00:46:11,535 --> 00:46:13,742
- She was a little child at that time.

490
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:18,650
Seven or eight years
before death. Poor little girl.

491
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:20,312
She died out of TB.

492
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:24,247
Then what happened?

493
00:46:24,248 --> 00:46:26,421
I was carrying him, in womb.

494
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,951
In that there is a dialogue
of Jayan in English.

495
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:34,026
We are collies, beggars, the
whole theater was rocking!

496
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,196
On hearing that 'horripilation'
fired up right from my toes.

497
00:46:37,261 --> 00:46:43,234
- When it got struck at the naval

498
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,680
I knew that it was
labor-pain not horripilation!

499
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:50,742
Then he rushed to the hospital
taking me and the daughter.

500
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,981
The moment we
reached at the hospital.

501
00:46:53,043 --> 00:46:54,818
The delivery happened. On the
spot the name was fixed Jayan.

502
00:46:57,781 --> 00:47:01,729
My child was pampering my
stomach, she was very fond of him.

503
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:08,532
She looks just like you. That
is why he loves you like this.

504
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:10,667
He saw you from somewhere.

505
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:13,333
Came after you.
Found out the house.

506
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:15,205
Threatened the owner of this house.

507
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:18,212
Took the upstairs of this house on
rent. What all problems like this?

508
00:47:18,402 --> 00:47:23,647
Now he wants to marry a nurse. Has
got a child also. A divorced case.

509
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,653
<i>I will</i> not allow as long as I'm alive,

510
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:29,690
doesn't like me, will fight
with me on whatever I say.

511
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:34,388
But he is an innocent guy,
sister's death and Father's death

512
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:35,987
- has brought sorrow in him.

513
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,430
But will not show outside.

514
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:41,296
As he lived without money,
he will do anything for money.

515
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:44,565
He longs for money.
He'll comejust now.

516
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,937
Let me go and set dinner for him.

517
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,636
He had left after naming Jayan,

518
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,942
now his temperament is that
of Jose Prakash, Balan K Nair

519
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,676
- and that of Kottayam Chellappan.

520
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:56,945
Everyone calls him mad Jayan.

521
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:05,983
He is always restless. He is
here, don't tell I had told all this.

522
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:12,395
You are sitting here
and chewing the fat! Come.

523
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:20,400
Brother I had harassed your men,
will they make me sit like this!

524
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,272
<i>Jayan W“ 9°'-!</i>

525
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:30,382
I was just joking, I'm all ordinary
guy, doesn't know anything,

526
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,942
long before when I was a child.

527
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:35,923
There was a leftist party here
which fragmented to two...

528
00:48:35,979 --> 00:48:40,758
Had heard from my
Father when I was young.

529
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:47,801
Com rade when a
leftist party splits to two,

530
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,893
- one should be left and the
other should be right is it not?

531
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,770
All I know is when our men
are beaten, will beat them,

532
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,806
- no matter whether
they are red, yellow or blue.

533
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:01,914
Sister shall I go.

534
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:10,081
Turn on that TV.

535
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,450
Before that we need
an appointment on next Friday.

536
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:14,986
Why is that?

537
00:49:18,355 --> 00:49:21,700
Three months back that cardiologist
had told to do an angiogram.

538
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,169
Do you have money for all this?

541
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:46,294
That police man called, must
go to a hotel for a dinner.

542
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:47,294
You also come with me.

543
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:48,329
I can't.

544
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:56,401
The house owner came yesterday,
why are you not paying the rent?

545
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:03,508
I know a big scam he had made, if I
report that, that fellow will be jailed.

546
00:50:04,868 --> 00:50:08,873
I'm corrupt sister,
I know how to live here.

547

By reading books, preaching, try to
be a saintly figure...Will be like that!

548

Don't talk nonsense and let go.

549
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:20,960
What Jayan's Mother told is true!

550
00:50:21,651 --> 00:50:23,688
He has kept you as his sister,

551
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:27,267
he has got sorrows, and
sister married a guy like me.

552

Oh! Is it? Comrade do your work.

553
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,697
In a way what he told is correct,

554
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,570
- it is the teachers, doctors
and police who deserves

555
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,540
the highest pay in a democracy.

556
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:38,373
Just look at the
disparity in their pay scale.

557
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:40,846
Did anyone tell him
to become a police man?

558
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:43,474
Did anyone tell me to
become a communist?

559
00:50:44,641 --> 00:50:48,248
Anna did anyone
tell you to marry this half man?

560

-these kind of touching dialogues.

562
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:58,394
Anna, you will edit that on
coming to fire brand rhetoric's.

to edit all, which you do not know.

By leaping fore
ward and give a smash,

- after that must move
backwards two steps and dance!

At that time, enemy
will come to strike us.

615

After evading from that smash,
only after that, must hit again.

Here I'm not talking
about any enemy.

617
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,434
Comrade Kaitheri is never a foe.

618
00:58:18,962 --> 00:58:21,465
But comrade must
present this inside the party.

619
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:22,939
Just to know the truth.

620
00:58:23,466 --> 00:58:25,810
I have understood
what you had meant.

621
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:32,051
But the relationship between me
and Sahadevan, as others know,

622
00:58:32,108 --> 00:58:33,815
- you also might have
known about it.

623
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,687
If I tell this inside the party circuits,

624
00:58:36,779 --> 00:58:41,421
- it will fabricated as my
grudge towards Sahadevan.

625
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:46,728
But as you have mentioned,
if this is put to print anywhere,

626
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,235
the rest of the things I will handle.

627
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:51,995
If it is executed like that,

628
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:54,539
can comrade give the
surety on security of the men

629
00:58:54,597 --> 00:58:56,634
who undertake that mission?

00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,108
Who are the editors of this?

00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:15,394
Do you have a membership in party?

632
00:59:15,518 --> 00:59:16,189
No.

633
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:19,190
What about you?
Don't have right now.

634
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:24,065
Do you know the consequences

00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,231
What more to come.

636
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:29,040
They do not have any
intention to endanger party,

637
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:31,669
- they are doing 'with a right motive'

638
00:59:31,768 --> 00:59:33,338
Do one thing.

639
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:39,077
Give this news as a two
column news in the third page.

640
00:59:39,375 --> 00:59:41,013
No need to print more copies.

641
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:46,985
Must not put any ones name.
I will manage the rest of the things.

642
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,990
Without creating any
problems to these men...

643
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:59,039
I can say there will be no problem to
Comrade Joseph Varghese's son

644

But...

645
00:59:59,796 --> 01:00:01,901

646
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:07,744
If you do as I have instructed
to do, nothing will happen.

transferred to Ammaravilla?

656
01:01:09,932 --> 01:01:12,344
Hey! Aren't you getting
this much is that not enough?

657
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:19,010

you do that for me, I'll just try.

You get the hold of her.

664
01:01:39,095 --> 01:01:40,836

665
01:01:40,930 --> 01:01:41,908
Rest of the things I'll handle.

666
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:43,705
I don't need any transfer.

667
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:53,648

668
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:55,911
Oh is it!

669
01:01:55,912 --> 01:01:56,754
Yea very much!

670
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:02,090
Has been working here for
some time, she is a Christian.

671
01:02:02,919 --> 01:02:06,196
Comrade the partial paralysis,
the issue is not only that,

672
01:02:07,523 --> 01:02:09,196
your heart is very weak.

673
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:26,552
Comrade told two
column in the third page is it not?

674
01:02:29,479 --> 01:02:31,720
What is it? Go
and mind your business!

675
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:40,692
Comrade if you are afraid, no need
but I'll put this in the front page.

676
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,030
This is our chance.

677
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:47,905
We embarked upon to tell
the truth! Is it not? Must do it!

678
01:02:49,065 --> 01:02:50,703
Without informing Comrade Roy!

679
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:53,646
No need to inform,
he has not got that old fire.

680
01:02:55,438 --> 01:03:03,186
Hey! I also feel we must do it but
without telling Comrade Roy. I...

681
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:06,589
Are you with me or not?

682
01:03:09,252 --> 01:03:10,094
With you.

683
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:17,068
Nothing will happen, 'absolute
annihilation' is an old story.

684
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,512
This guy is not giving
any piece of mind.

685
01:03:30,573 --> 01:03:31,984
Who? Is it that police officer?

686
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,043
The guy you are about to
meet will give piece of mind!

687
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:38,250
A Sugar boy, but a coward,
depends on how you handle.

688
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:41,484
I do not have any other choice.

689
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:56,502
Say one Iakh.

690
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:07,521
No...In a bad shape financially.
As soon as possible.

691
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:18,927
Told the husband is dead, then
what about their family members?

692
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,658
Will not agree!

693
01:04:21,757 --> 01:04:23,930
No need to agree...Only
your consent is required.

694
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:27,236
No doubt that
everyone calls you mad.

695
01:04:27,463 --> 01:04:30,637
As you told, when you see Anitha,
she is like your sister, no problem.

696
01:04:30,766 --> 01:04:32,871
Is that nurse like that?

697
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:38,180
But this is a wired idea, that nurse
who treated my child is like your wife.

698
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,984
I couldn't find any similarity, maybe
you might not be looking at the face.

699
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,045
Why are you like this?

700
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,116
Get lost you!

701
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,288
If you carry on like this, if you tell,

702
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:51,025
someone on the street is just like
you Father, will I have to marry?

703
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,900
'Corruption amounting to crores'
(News paper headline)

704
01:05:40,503 --> 01:05:43,347

commence within a short while...

707
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,839
-at Trivandrum Press club. It is
held by opposition leader SR.

708

Why is that a press meet like this?

709
01:06:53,209 --> 01:06:56,850
Don't know, channel is saying
there is a news to be veiled.

710
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:01,752
This is a report which
appeared in a newspaper...

711
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:04,388
about a prominent
leader in our party.

712
01:07:06,455 --> 01:07:09,595
When enquired about
the truth behind this.

713
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:13,536
It was found that, there is also
certain amount of truth in it.

714
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:18,310
When one asks, is it a
move to destroy the party?

715
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:21,075
I can only say, don't know.

716
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:26,446
Or when one asks, it is a
move to safeguard the party.

717
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:30,520
For the time being I
can only say, don't know.

Whatever it may be,

719
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:40,792
-this accusation on Comrade
Kaitheri...This shocking accusation.

720
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,460
The party cannot
regain its lost image,

721
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,562
- until and unless this
accusation is proved wrong.

722
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:48,642
The accusation against
Kaitheri must be enquired,

723
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:50,176
opposition leader SR comments.

724
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:55,238
He was talking in a press
conference on a report...

725
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,476
- which came against Kaitheri.

726
01:07:57,973 --> 01:07:59,452
With a Canadian Company...

727
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:10,864
No pardon for you,
Corrupted Sahadeva!

728
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:18,899
Comrade.

729
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:50,265
Aren't these men your leaders?

730
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:54,601
Why must they smile to this extend?

731
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:58,969
What had been done
here to smile like this?

732
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:02,612
While running the
government, can siphon-off!

733
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:05,515
But after one, there is an
arithmetids on number of zero's...

734
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:06,746
- to be added after it.

735
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,015
This smile is for
manipulating that arithmetic's!

736
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:20,123
As a protest against
the series of violence...

737
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:22,226
- targeted on Kaitheri Sahadevan'.

738
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:27,001
RPM state secretary had
called for a state wide harthal.

739
01:09:27,129 --> 01:09:31,134
The harthal is from morning 6
o'clock to evening 6 o'clock.

740
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:34,807
The emergency services
had been exempted from harthal.

741
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:37,111
We will tell one thing!

742
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:42,239
If you come to shuffle with us,
the nature of strike will change!

743
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,367
One second,
tomorrow there is harthal.

744

Come to the bus stop near Jaya
Matha hospital. I'll be there.

why not eat the worms inside it.

To put that news in the third page
as two column, did you do that?

I had also mentioned not to put
names of anyone. Did you do that?

760

Even though technically, had
I gone done any mistakes? No...

761
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:22,639
There are certain rules in boxing.

762
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:25,082
Comrade this is no boxing or law.

763
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:30,385
It is old story, story of a wolf,
who wanted to 'drink blood'

764
01:12:30,446 --> 01:12:31,823
This is that.

765

for the last time, before his death.

I had got in to a bus,

771

Which bus?
Medical College.

772

01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:12,876
Maniyyan come to the turning where
we took the turn you come there fast.

838
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:17,809
Jump, fast!

839
01:21:49,838 --> 01:21:52,011
The rooms of the house is
completely destroyed.

840
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:54,477
The press...ls also fully destroyed.

841
01:21:55,744 --> 01:22:00,523
Deepa? Children?

842
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:24,643
Didn't I tell you not
to turn on the light?

843
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:26,337
Are you not ashamed
to say like this?

844
01:23:26,468 --> 01:23:28,414
How many times
did I tell you no need of this?

845
01:23:28,503 --> 01:23:32,110
Did you hear me? Now you are
scaredmWhen one sneezes,

846
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,949
when children cries,
are you all communists!

847
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:37,283
You speak low!

848
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:40,053
The only income was from
that shop now that is also gone.

849
01:23:42,050 --> 01:23:46,829
What do you want now?
Little bit of milk powder and bread.

850
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,801
You stand here!

851
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:37,774
Comrade!

852
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:40,716
Suresh it is not safe there,
you hide out somewhere else.

853
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:42,378
Comrade I...

854
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:49,122
Hey Suresh!

855
01:25:05,133 --> 01:25:06,635
What happened?

856
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:14,704

857
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:19,214
Haven't I told?

858
01:26:39,761 --> 01:26:41,138
Move back.

859
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:45,309
Stand aside.

860
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:30,621
Sir, is there any political
motive behind this murder'?

861
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:42,833
There is no enough information to
say who and all are involved behind this.

862
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:49,166
Whether political
or nonpolitical matters.

863
01:27:55,169 --> 01:27:59,675
Anna hot water.

864
01:28:17,091 --> 01:28:18,661
Go fast.
Okay.

865
01:28:25,066 --> 01:28:27,637
There is drastic fluctuation on ECG,

866
01:28:27,869 --> 01:28:30,543
didn't I tell there should
not be any kind of stress?

867
01:28:37,111 --> 01:28:41,719
After all that thing is
more reddish than yourflag.

868
01:28:45,453 --> 01:28:49,663
Why should be so much involved?
Is there any big problem?

869
01:29:15,249 --> 01:29:20,426
Oh! I forgot, I'm speaking to
that old fire band atJNU.

870
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:31,239
Where is Jennifer?
She left the job.

871
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,280
What is this advocate?

872
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:41,182
The days of old wheat balls are
all gone, now there is lavish food.

873
01:29:41,242 --> 01:29:43,688
In the mist of this, rice in the carrier.

874
01:29:43,811 --> 01:29:46,087
The lady staying
downstairs, brought this.

875
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:53,761
Your sister!

876
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:06,511
You want water?

877
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:10,878
Mother?

878
01:30:11,005 --> 01:30:14,714
No problem at all. She
is there watching TV.

879
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:17,413
She wants you to be there.

880
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,751
Mother is wise!

881
01:30:19,881 --> 01:30:21,827
Taken the charges on murder,

882
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,623
- apart from that, there
are three other cases also.

883
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:27,062
Someone had informed
about the quarters also.

884
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:31,098
Then a bribery case
that textile shop owner.

885
01:30:31,993 --> 01:30:35,031
Then your house
owner had also given one.

886
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:38,008
Can't say anything,
lot of expenses involved.

887
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:39,543
How much do you have in hand?

888
01:30:39,634 --> 01:30:43,013
Said you have not touched the
salary for the last five years.

889
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:45,174
Adding up everything
will it come to 5 Iakhs?

890
01:30:45,306 --> 01:30:48,253
In the bank there
is rupees 4, 78, 480.

891
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:50,720
I'll go to your house
and bring that cheque book,

892
01:30:50,845 --> 01:30:53,382
- sign and give ten leaves.

893
01:30:53,815 --> 01:30:59,128
For the time being will take bail,
for the maxim um three weeks.

894
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:01,597
You don't worry before
that will get the bail.

895
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:03,065
Give me your phone.

896
01:31:03,224 --> 01:31:06,330
That is not allowed here. Isn't it?

897
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:12,361

01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:31,487
Hey that Jayson is here.

899
01:31:35,857 --> 01:31:39,100
You do one thing,
when I tell you, make a call.

900
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:52,114
Come.

901
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:02,427
When will it be ready?

902
01:32:04,085 --> 01:32:05,428
Sit.

903
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:15,103
Oh! It's Jolly aunty. Jolly aunty
Jayson here. I had called you.

904
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:16,333
Uncle told me.

905
01:32:16,464 --> 01:32:21,038
Is my Papa and Mummy fine there?
Seems like they have forgotten me.

906
01:32:21,168 --> 01:32:24,240
This Columbus Cross
Over business was handed...

907
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:26,648
over to me and they had left.

908
01:32:29,076 --> 01:32:33,821
I had called to tell about that.
The name is Jennifer Kuruvilla.

909
01:32:33,948 --> 01:32:36,485
I had prepared the
documents in such a way.

910
01:32:36,717 --> 01:32:38,924
She is the cousin of Jolly aunty.

911
01:32:39,353 --> 01:32:43,028
I had also pushed in big
way through the church.

912
01:32:55,102 --> 01:32:58,106
Take care of her,
she is very close person for me.

913
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:39,355
Yes sir, I'll come. It is from the
hospital, there is an emergency.

914
01:33:41,816 --> 01:33:43,489
I'll meet you at the Office.

915
01:33:57,665 --> 01:34:01,135
We came to know what you wrote
against Com rade Sahadevan...

916
01:34:01,235 --> 01:34:02,737
which would have been avoided.

917
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:05,315
You don't know he is stealing.

918
01:34:05,406 --> 01:34:08,012
No need to tell that,
will not understand also,

919
01:34:08,109 --> 01:34:10,521
- in a way what you did is betrayal!

920
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:13,317
But Sahadevan is a man!

921
01:34:13,447 --> 01:34:17,020
When you were wandering,
it was him who arranged a job.

922
01:34:17,151 --> 01:34:18,926
For your sister at the
co-operative bank.

923
01:34:19,053 --> 01:34:21,499
Have you heard of a
person named Chathu?

924
01:34:21,622 --> 01:34:21,997
No.

925
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:23,568
Or his brother Am bu?

926
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:24,159
No.

927
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:29,138
On waging a war with someone,
you must know who and all's blood

928
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:30,799
- had shed on his dress.

929
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:33,875
Or else you will not know
from where chop will come!

930
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,605
Do you know what Communism is?

931
01:34:35,803 --> 01:34:39,341
I do not know, but this
'paddy field' knows that...

932
01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:42,716
these 'small ridge
in the fields 'knows it.

933
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:46,118
Whatever it may be...

934
01:34:46,247 --> 01:34:48,227
Sahadevan knows how to
handle people who are with him.

935
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:50,295
That is why, early
morning, in the mud...

936
01:34:50,384 --> 01:34:52,557
in the old age going
round with buffalo.

937
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:57,167
You people are eating, because
we communist are turning blood...

938
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,736
in to water in these fields.

939
01:34:58,826 --> 01:35:00,271
Don't overstay in one place,

940
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:02,170
keep changing the places
that is only possible.

941
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:32,429
There is no range here.

942
01:35:35,429 --> 01:35:38,376
You people want development,
but none should get commission...

943
01:35:38,466 --> 01:35:39,945
is it not what you people say?

944
01:35:40,034 --> 01:35:42,913
Whatever you write, we
are still with comrade Kaitheri.

945
01:35:44,805 --> 01:35:47,547
When are you going
back? Staying here is not safe.

946
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:52,684
Don't worry I'll go tomorrow.

947
01:36:01,155 --> 01:36:03,897
Comrade, they will finish
Aliyar also, wait and see.

948
01:36:04,225 --> 01:36:05,329
Who?

949
01:36:06,994 --> 01:36:08,837
There is only one way out,

950
01:36:09,063 --> 01:36:13,534
Comrade you go and
meet Kaitheri, must plead to him.

951
01:36:22,343 --> 01:36:23,413
Comrade!

952
01:36:26,547 --> 01:36:32,259
The fractional groups within the
party and the enemies outside the party.

953
01:36:32,419 --> 01:36:36,697
We must differentiate
and identify them.

954
01:36:37,658 --> 01:36:42,607
Brave Comrades of RPM,
my Lal Salam to you all.

955
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:50,009
Brave leader Kaitheri,
lead on bravely.

Comrade!

958
01:38:29,103 --> 01:38:32,573
What is it? Are you creating a
'Tiananmen Square' here?

959
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,413
Must talk to you, comrade.

960
01:38:34,541 --> 01:38:35,417
From here?

961
01:38:35,576 --> 01:38:38,386
Tried to meet, at several places.

962
01:38:40,547 --> 01:38:42,959
He is our man, go and sit in the car.

963
01:38:49,223 --> 01:38:51,703
Come, will stand there.

964
01:38:59,233 --> 01:39:00,735
How are you Chellappan?

965
01:39:00,968 --> 01:39:05,348
Who is this? It has
been very long, to see you.

966
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:10,787
I must come, our hospital is
going to come, and it is for you.

967
01:39:11,545 --> 01:39:13,923
I feel like having a soda.
I'll take now.

968
01:39:14,014 --> 01:39:15,391
Do you want?
No.

969
01:39:18,519 --> 01:39:20,055
Take the one with
marble balls inside.

970
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:21,359
Don't you know that?

971
01:39:28,762 --> 01:39:30,366
It is an old habit,

972
01:39:30,731 --> 01:39:36,841
Father could manage to buy
this one and that minted toffee.

973
01:39:36,937 --> 01:39:38,382
That too once in a year!

974
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:43,178
Now do you have
any another ailments?

975
01:39:43,243 --> 01:39:44,517
Comrade got a request to make.

976
01:39:44,645 --> 01:39:45,244
What?

977
01:39:45,245 --> 01:39:48,783
Don't harm thatAliyar.
Who is this Aliyar?

978
01:39:48,849 --> 01:39:51,921
They have lost a lot
and are indigent also.

979
01:39:52,019 --> 01:39:55,865
Who is this Aliyar?
Oh, the Communist.

980
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:58,334
I beg you!

981
01:39:58,926 --> 01:40:00,928
Corruption worth of crores!

982
01:40:01,028 --> 01:40:04,339
Suspicious fingers pointed
on Kaitheri Sahadevan!

983
01:40:04,565 --> 01:40:09,105
What I wanted to tell you, I had told
you on that day over the phone.

984
01:40:09,269 --> 01:40:11,806
Do you want in detail, I'll tell.

985
01:40:11,905 --> 01:40:15,284
For the maintenance work of Chek
dam, for replacing turbine.

986
01:40:15,376 --> 01:40:18,846
And for the construction of the
outer wall of the Chek dam.

987
01:40:19,046 --> 01:40:21,583
Based on the agreement
made in the year 2007...

988
01:40:21,715 --> 01:40:22,989
with the Canadian company.

989
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:27,725
I'm the one, who demanded and
accepted the commission!

990
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:34,303
I got it has solid money! The
commission was 3.75 crores of rupees!

991
01:40:34,828 --> 01:40:36,865
But out of that money...

992
01:40:36,964 --> 01:40:39,843
Sahadevan never 'wore or
ate' any single paisa from it.

993
01:40:39,967 --> 01:40:43,676
Only 'had fed and
had made to wear'

994
01:40:45,005 --> 01:40:48,111
Is comrade's son's course
at Brahmin Ham over?

995
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:50,889
An English man had written a
letter to you from Brahmin Ham...

996
01:40:51,011 --> 01:40:52,081
University saying...

997
01:40:52,312 --> 01:40:56,021
- His performance in the
major subjects were poor...

998
01:40:56,116 --> 01:40:59,791
and must call his parents, in 2009

999
01:40:59,987 --> 01:41:01,364
Do you remember that?

1000
01:41:01,822 --> 01:41:03,460
<i>Comrade you went to London,</i>

1001
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:06,298
saw the Big Ben, saw
the cemetery of Marx.

1002
01:41:06,427 --> 01:41:10,204
Saw the house of Shake Sphere at
Avon, went to the Baker Street.

1003
01:41:10,297 --> 01:41:12,971
If I ask you, where did
you get the money for all this,

1004
01:41:13,067 --> 01:41:15,047
- for a 'clean imaged' communist?

1005
01:41:15,202 --> 01:41:20,208
Hey, have you heard
of my Father Chathu

1006
01:41:20,441 --> 01:41:24,218
I had a step Father
Ammbu heard of him?

1007
01:41:24,411 --> 01:41:25,219
Yes.

1008
01:41:26,346 --> 01:41:31,728
There are a lot, which is not
heard. Chathu's Father Raman.

1009
01:41:31,852 --> 01:41:37,530
One who is succumb to all rain and
sun's wrath in the fields of Nair's.

1010
01:41:37,691 --> 01:41:41,434
When Raman goes for work,
Chathu and Ammbu goes along.

1011
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:42,302
For what?

1012
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:44,909
At noon they will get some porridge!

1013
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:49,247
While on making boundaries
for a coconut tree.

1014
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:49,744
If at all any roots are broken...

1015
01:41:49,903 --> 01:41:51,940
While making the ridges,
if there appears any bend...

1016
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:57,146
- But severe beating with tamarind
tree stick! That noon, no porridge...

1017
01:41:57,277 --> 01:42:01,817
- That too, on the
same spot of the work!

1018
01:42:01,949 --> 01:42:03,257
May be at fields, or in courtyards!

1019
01:42:03,383 --> 01:42:04,657
Put a hole in the ground,
over that leaf will be placed,

1020
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:06,731
must move away twenty feet!

1021
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:13,632
On that leaf placed in the mud, the
aristocratic lady will pour porridge!

1022
01:42:14,862 --> 01:42:17,240
When Raman died of small pox!

1023
01:42:17,865 --> 01:42:21,608
Never a tear dropped
from Chathu and Ammbu!

1024
01:42:21,702 --> 01:42:25,548
Why? Because
they had the support,

1025
01:42:25,672 --> 01:42:28,949
which was hosted by
them on the ridges in the field.

1026
01:42:29,076 --> 01:42:31,784
'The Pole of a red flag'

1027
01:42:32,846 --> 01:42:36,293
At that time it only
had the height of them.

1028
01:42:36,917 --> 01:42:41,991
On the strength of that 'red flag'
Chathu walked on the streets...

1029
01:42:42,122 --> 01:42:43,226
with the head up!

1030
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:48,840
Sahadevan grew up on seeing the
blood of that 'Chathu and Ammbu'

1031
01:42:49,663 --> 01:42:52,837
During the time of Sahadevan
'red flags' pole grew taller.

1032
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:55,745
Raman dug the hole!

1033
01:42:55,903 --> 01:42:58,406
Chathu hosted the flag!

1034
01:42:58,539 --> 01:43:04,922
Sahadevan will make that
flag fly higher and higher!

1035
01:43:06,246 --> 01:43:09,819
Sahadevan's children
will study in England! Will grow!

1036
01:43:09,950 --> 01:43:13,193
To vanquish a bourgeois, it is no
use of becoming a bourgeois...

1037
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:15,391
Must become Father of a bourgeois!

1038
01:43:15,522 --> 01:43:19,732
Otherwise it is not
possible it my ideology!

1039
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:22,431
I'll take my action based on this!

1040
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:29,144
If one creates a hindrance
in my path! I'll make them to fly!

1041
01:43:30,270 --> 01:43:34,082
Sahadevan is a rich man!
And a rich man's communist!

1042
01:43:34,441 --> 01:43:39,754
Those pariah dogs! Who
are with you, they will also say...!

1043
01:43:44,017 --> 01:43:48,124
- Only once...Never
will speak after that!

1044
01:43:48,355 --> 01:43:49,993
I'll make their mouth shut!

1045
01:43:50,123 --> 01:43:53,195
Like shutting the mouth
of a tender mango pickle jar!

1046
01:43:54,328 --> 01:43:57,207
The indigent who stand by the party,

1047
01:43:57,364 --> 01:44:01,403
-this Sahadevan had
considered only them as poor.

1048
01:44:01,702 --> 01:44:08,347
It is for those poor men this Raman's
son's son had always stood for!

1049
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:17,991
Hey! Including you,

1050
01:44:18,118 --> 01:44:21,258
- I had served the food for
all, to gulp in to the throat!

1051
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:25,232
The very orphanage,
where you do social uplifting!

1052
01:44:25,392 --> 01:44:26,894
And that college...

1053
01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:29,338
where your Delhi-born wife
takes classes for journal writing!

1054
01:44:29,963 --> 01:44:34,412
To run all this where
does the money come from?

1055
01:44:34,534 --> 01:44:39,005
Chek dam! Turbine! Outer wall!

1056
01:44:39,172 --> 01:44:44,121
Suspicious fingers pointed
at Kaitheri Sahadevan!

1057
01:44:45,946 --> 01:44:49,826
I like foot- ball game a lot.

1058
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:54,092
To hit the goal with left leg,
must play with right leg.

1059
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:58,100
After the game, to reach home...
Walking with both legs.

1060
01:44:58,258 --> 01:45:01,000
It is not left, left instead...

1061
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:06,544
it is left, right...But can go
only by saying 'left, right, left'

1062
01:45:06,667 --> 01:45:12,276
You know the difficulty,
when it is not like that.

1063
01:45:12,406 --> 01:45:14,613
I have not come here to
hear a sermon on your ideology.

1064
01:45:14,741 --> 01:45:16,846
Neither to show the ledger of
accounts 'given or taken'...

1065
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:18,285
done for the movement.

1066
01:45:18,512 --> 01:45:20,856
If I do that, there is no difference
between me and comrade!

1067
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:25,559
You have tangled with
me once, long back!

1068
01:45:25,686 --> 01:45:30,760
If I wanted, I could have finished
you on that day! I won't do that.

1069
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:35,431
I'll not touch you.
I respect your Father.

1070
01:45:35,595 --> 01:45:41,409
He was a God-Father to me.
A fool but brave!

1071
01:45:41,868 --> 01:45:48,046
Never again cause a
hindrance like this! Hear that!

1072
01:46:03,990 --> 01:46:08,837
Comrade party can use gun but
must see that gun never uses party!

1073
01:46:10,030 --> 01:46:13,603
It is not, what I said
but the words of Mao!

1074
01:46:15,602 --> 01:46:17,809
First there will be a revolution
lead by peace lovers.

1075
01:46:18,171 --> 01:46:20,515
- If you act. As if it is
not heard and see.

1076
01:46:20,807 --> 01:46:23,287
It'll be followed by a
revolution lead by lunatics.

1077
01:46:24,311 --> 01:46:27,986
Come get in I'll drop
you at the nextjunction.

1078
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:35,059
No need, the left leg is
incapable but still can walk with it.

1079
01:47:04,985 --> 01:47:07,556
On the decision of making
permanent, there is...

1080
01:47:08,755 --> 01:47:12,259
I don't know why such
a decision is taken?

1081
01:47:12,459 --> 01:47:16,498
Had given all the certificates,
told that it will be ready soon.

1082
01:47:17,464 --> 01:47:19,307
Did anyone from the party...

1083
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:21,504
I know, its okay.

1084
01:47:35,715 --> 01:47:40,221
If we intend, we can
throw him and his nest like this.

1085
01:47:40,353 --> 01:47:42,390
But this movement
had not grown like that.

1086
01:47:42,589 --> 01:47:49,199
He did that without any intention, if
you want he will beg before you.

1087
01:47:49,563 --> 01:47:52,669
Kindly talk to comrade Sahadevan
and make him understand,

1088
01:47:52,899 --> 01:47:56,108
now anything will happen,
only if he decides.

1089
01:47:56,903 --> 01:47:58,211
Nothing will be sorted out,

1090
01:47:58,405 --> 01:48:01,818
there are ten or twelve men here
with broken neck, on account of him.

1091
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:05,919
Then all this issues are
not resolved from our end.

1092
01:48:06,746 --> 01:48:12,162
This is murder! There is a person
who is above us, seeing all this!

1093
01:48:16,223 --> 01:48:19,932
Above...Means
comrade Sahadevan!

1094
01:48:20,126 --> 01:48:23,767
If at all anything should
happen, comrade must decide.

1095
01:48:23,897 --> 01:48:27,936
For the time being go and take the
bail, on that we will not do anything.

1096
01:48:42,215 --> 01:48:45,788
This thing is great, it is
not the way as I expected.

1097
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:50,167
I beg you, comrade tell something.

1098
01:48:50,357 --> 01:48:56,308
I had also empathized on that
murder also. I went there and garlanded.

1099
01:48:56,830 --> 01:49:02,473
If anything happens like that I'll
again empathize in a similar manner.

1100
01:49:03,136 --> 01:49:05,844
A' iya r?

1101
01:49:06,473 --> 01:49:08,578
The person who
came with me on that day.

1102
01:49:08,675 --> 01:49:12,316
You go. It is said that, not to
talk while walking on this.

1103
01:49:12,445 --> 01:49:15,221
Wolf...Drinking blood is it not?

1104
01:49:15,348 --> 01:49:17,021
That is more than enough.

1105
01:49:37,003 --> 01:49:38,914
I'll never forget Jayson.

1106
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:47,742
<i>xxx-Team Splash-xxx</i>

1107
01:50:13,006 --> 01:50:15,452
I have got some
urgent matters to look in to.

1108
01:50:15,508 --> 01:50:19,285
Son's school documents
are ready, must go and collect it.

1109
01:50:20,747 --> 01:50:22,784
I had not forgotten the
promise that I gave to Jayson.

1110
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:30,233
Before I go to airport. Tomorrow you
should wear this T shirt and come.

1111
01:50:30,457 --> 01:50:32,869
We will go somewhere
and spend one hour.

1112
01:50:37,897 --> 01:50:39,433
Did you like this T shirt?

1113
01:51:05,158 --> 01:51:08,264
Daughter you don't worry
everything will be all right.

1114
01:51:08,495 --> 01:51:11,942
Look, how much I had seen.

1115
01:51:12,098 --> 01:51:13,372
I don't have any worries.

1116
01:51:13,533 --> 01:51:15,740
Just imagine his fate.

1117
01:51:16,269 --> 01:51:22,311
I'm not going to go crying around.
Whatever who ever says I know him.

1118
01:51:22,742 --> 01:51:27,213
If he had killed, then the other one
might have done something wrong.

1119
01:51:28,148 --> 01:51:32,290
Her husband gave one
time meal and told me to go.

1120
01:51:32,619 --> 01:51:34,724
Now nobody is going to
give anything, comrade.

1121
01:51:34,854 --> 01:51:37,858
Did you meet SR?
Then what?

1122
01:51:40,860 --> 01:51:44,273
Comrade you don't
worry I'm going to Coimbatore.

1123
01:51:44,631 --> 01:51:46,440
If I stay here, I will be
slaughtered for sure!

1124
01:51:46,533 --> 01:51:48,012
Do you have any money with you?

1125
01:52:07,587 --> 01:52:10,329
What was the use of telling,
tomorrow you will meet him?

1126
01:52:10,457 --> 01:52:14,030
Yes, I must, he can
spoil the trip till the last minute.

1127
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,969
Till then it should continue like this.

1128
01:52:16,096 --> 01:52:19,737
Tomorrow you will board and go
that police will come and ask me.

1129
01:52:19,833 --> 01:52:21,574
You don't worry about
that he is in jail.

1130
01:52:21,835 --> 01:52:23,712
Quite unfair, what you did to him.

1131
01:52:23,837 --> 01:52:28,582
Yes it is unfair, the Mathews
was a mistake on my part.

1132
01:52:28,708 --> 01:52:30,119
I was suffering that.

1133
01:52:30,243 --> 01:52:35,192
But this boy, he came after him.
That is difficult for me to tolerate.

1134
01:52:36,015 --> 01:52:37,517
From the Mathews, the mistake...

1135
01:52:37,717 --> 01:52:39,287
I did to the right which
I'm going to do tomorrow.

1136
01:52:39,419 --> 01:52:40,329
There are thousands
of mistakes in between.

1137
01:52:40,487 --> 01:52:42,330
I wouldn't have reached here,
by doing that completely.

1138
01:52:42,455 --> 01:52:43,456
I did that.

1139
01:52:45,725 --> 01:52:48,501
There are certain truths on
what Mathews had told.

1140
01:52:48,628 --> 01:52:49,868
What?

1141
01:52:50,130 --> 01:52:53,634
Honestly speaking, Leo has
got no similarity of Mathews.

1142
01:53:06,646 --> 01:53:09,217
There is drastic fluctuation on ECG.

1143
01:53:09,415 --> 01:53:11,952
Didn't I tell you, there
should not be any stress?

1144
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,156
On the decision of making
permanent, there is...

1145
01:53:15,321 --> 01:53:18,234
I don't know why such
a decision is taken?

1146
01:53:38,211 --> 01:53:41,192
Anne, what happened?

1147
01:53:41,748 --> 01:53:44,126
Nothing about tomorrow's class.

1148
01:53:46,219 --> 01:53:46,822
Come.

1149
01:54:01,234 --> 01:54:03,612
Where is Jenny?
From jail...When?

1150
01:54:03,736 --> 01:54:05,044
Where is Jenny?

1151
01:54:08,074 --> 01:54:09,144
She has gone.

1152
01:54:09,275 --> 01:54:12,085
Where?
To America.

1153
01:54:13,213 --> 01:54:17,184
Amer...When?

1154
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:18,487
Today!

1155
01:54:18,618 --> 01:54:20,962
Which flight?
In the morning.

1156
01:54:21,120 --> 01:54:23,464
Morning! There is
no flight to America.

1157
01:54:23,656 --> 01:54:25,567
I don't know.
Don't you know?

1158
01:54:28,761 --> 01:54:31,833
Which agency?
Columbus consultancy.

1159
01:54:31,965 --> 01:54:32,943
Where is that?

1160
01:54:43,343 --> 01:54:46,722
Jennifer Kuruvilla and her son
Leo, where are they going?

1161
01:54:46,846 --> 01:54:47,881
When? Which flight?

1162
01:54:50,250 --> 01:54:51,661
Hey you, tell!

1163
01:54:56,756 --> 01:54:58,030
What are you saying?

1164
01:55:01,694 --> 01:55:03,867
In which flight is Jennifer going?

1165
01:55:05,098 --> 01:55:06,805
Take off the hands from me!

1166
01:55:09,402 --> 01:55:10,574
<i>Speak up you son ** * “g!</i>

1167
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:14,447
I will hit you!

1168
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:18,088
Do you want the
information or to kill me?

1169
01:55:19,279 --> 01:55:20,121
Tell.

1170
01:55:20,413 --> 01:55:24,555
I will. But within this
five minutes I have to tell.

1171
01:55:24,684 --> 01:55:26,425
- Then only it will be
advantage to you.

1172
01:55:26,619 --> 01:55:29,600
Tell fast!
I will tell.

1173
01:55:29,923 --> 01:55:33,769
But first you return that 4000 rupees
which you snatched from me...

1174
01:55:33,860 --> 01:55:34,964
plus interest.

1175
01:55:35,128 --> 01:55:38,041
Return it.

1176
01:55:38,264 --> 01:55:40,938
You Achayya! (One who
is keen on money matters)

1177
01:55:48,174 --> 01:55:49,152
Not enough!

1178
01:55:51,544 --> 01:55:52,682
Take this, and eat!

1179
01:56:03,623 --> 01:56:04,863
What time?

1180
01:56:07,527 --> 01:56:08,631
2:05!

<i>Satya m Audios</i>

1182
01:56:59,579 --> 01:57:02,116
You don't worry, the
security check is completed.

1183
01:57:02,248 --> 01:57:03,955
Is it an international airport?

1184
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:06,194
Moreover that guy is
on suspension now!

1185
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:10,165
That is not possible, not even a
mosquito can come near me!

1186
01:57:10,256 --> 01:57:11,098
Possible!

1187
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:21,445
This is India. If a
mosquito intends, will come,

1188
01:57:21,534 --> 01:57:24,947
- will bite and put you on task!

1189
01:57:28,374 --> 01:57:35,383
My Mother told on seeing you,
you are filthy! Didn't hear that.

1190
01:57:35,548 --> 01:57:41,328
After releasing from the jail, didn't go
first to see her, came to see you.

1191
01:57:41,487 --> 01:57:46,960
If this Jayan really intends
I can sniff you from here...

1192
01:57:47,093 --> 01:57:48,333
without any ones notice.

1193
01:57:48,895 --> 01:57:51,637
I have the guts to do
that, that's why I'm here.

1194
01:57:53,066 --> 01:57:55,842
When my colleagues and
advocate asked me repeatedly...

1195
01:57:55,968 --> 01:57:57,311
the reason for killing your husband.

1196
01:57:57,804 --> 01:58:02,480
I could have mentioned
your name, but I'll not do that.

1197
01:58:03,509 --> 01:58:06,080
I cannot look inside
me, after doing that.

1198
01:58:07,046 --> 01:58:09,219
After all this running
and standing before you.

1199
01:58:09,348 --> 01:58:13,228
- Like Kamal Hassan in
'Moonnam Mura' I'll tell you why.

1200
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:18,359
You don't think you are going by
fooling me. If you think like that.

1201
01:58:18,558 --> 01:58:22,529
It is a shame for me.
Did you hear that?

1202
01:58:25,031 --> 01:58:30,344
Go and come will flourish.

1203
01:58:35,641 --> 01:58:42,820
Child go and come, must study well.
I had brought a thing for you.

If you do like this will be jailed.

1219
02:00:48,174 --> 02:00:50,211
Will you stay with the sister?

1220
02:00:51,110 --> 02:00:55,115
If the things are happening like
this, that is the only way.

02:01:41,927 --> 02:01:43,338
You take this.
Okay.

1226
02:01:43,462 --> 02:01:46,238
Five Iakhs in hand is also finished.

1227
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:48,538
The un necessary ones
will not come to the court.

1228
02:01:48,668 --> 02:01:53,139
Nobody will speak un necessarily.
Money is stuffed till throat!

1229
02:01:53,272 --> 02:01:56,617
The problem is that mobile video.

1230
02:01:56,709 --> 02:02:02,955
Nothing can be done on that. Can't
escape by saying it is morphed.

1231
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:05,288
See, anything can be done with this.

1232
02:02:08,020 --> 02:02:12,264
Is it not a Phycatric perception?
Is it not an old one?

1233
02:02:13,959 --> 02:02:16,496
Have you shown all this
during the time of training?

1234
02:02:16,629 --> 02:02:20,133
If I show all this I will
not get my uniform...Advocate

1235
02:02:23,769 --> 02:02:25,544
Where is this doctor now?

1236
02:02:25,671 --> 02:02:29,710
He died four years
back...He is dead!

1237
02:02:29,942 --> 02:02:31,285
What? Are you still taking it?

1238
02:02:31,744 --> 02:02:32,688
Yes.

1239
02:02:33,813 --> 02:02:36,919
Are you really mad?
Yes.

1240
02:02:39,418 --> 02:02:45,391
No doubt...You are really impossible!
This will not work out now.

1241
02:02:45,725 --> 02:02:52,040
If this has to be worked out, you
must do what I tell you to do.

1242
02:02:52,131 --> 02:02:52,802
What is it?

1243
02:02:53,332 --> 02:02:56,677
We must meet that
Kaitheri Sahadevan.

1244
02:02:56,769 --> 02:03:00,911
I have told everything and
arranged. Must plead with him.

1245
02:03:01,140 --> 02:03:03,677
Then all those
supporters are against you.

1246
02:03:04,110 --> 02:03:07,683
If anything is to
happen he must decide.

1247
02:03:07,847 --> 02:03:09,724
If I go the jail what will
be the punishment?

1248
02:03:10,483 --> 02:03:13,464
Sometimes 'behind
the bars' or 'rope'

1249
02:03:13,586 --> 02:03:15,691
if we had money
something can be done.

1250
02:03:15,788 --> 02:03:18,428
That is also not there,
and no one will give you also.

1251
02:03:18,724 --> 02:03:21,898
For your release, I had to spent
rupees 25,000. Separately...

1252
02:03:21,994 --> 02:03:23,473
by giving under the table.

1253
02:03:23,562 --> 02:03:25,940
Without pay, if you
survive only through bribe,

1254
02:03:26,065 --> 02:03:30,013
- after sometime no
pay and no bribe.

1255
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:37,216
Sir, your mobile is vibrating.

1256
02:03:41,847 --> 02:03:44,726
Comrade tomorrow I'm
going to Hyderabad.

1257
02:03:44,950 --> 02:03:48,090
I spoke to a friend Gunna Rao
Mohamed Rasher over the phone.

1258
02:03:48,788 --> 02:03:50,426
Are they Naxal leaders?

1259
02:03:50,589 --> 02:03:55,129
Yes. That is the only way out,
a born foe like Sahadevan,

1260
02:03:55,261 --> 02:03:59,038
- they will finish him!
If it is forest, forest!

1261
02:04:00,433 --> 02:04:05,781
Aliyar committing
wrong! Listen to me.

1262
02:04:06,005 --> 02:04:08,281
Nothing more to say,
nothing more to hear.

1263
02:04:17,716 --> 02:04:20,697
This back pain is
because of taking strain like this.

1264
02:04:21,520 --> 02:04:26,526
Anna...l...

1265
02:04:27,827 --> 02:04:29,170
What is it?

1266
02:04:31,263 --> 02:04:36,269
The death is only
continuation of life.

1267
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:40,207
When lot of chemicals join together,

1268
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:42,979
- resulting in the
formation of an organism.

1269
02:04:43,742 --> 02:04:47,986
When some other chemicals join
together, the mind of that wakes up.

1270
02:04:49,548 --> 02:04:54,896
Life is a marriage of elements,
death is the divorce of the same.

1271
02:04:55,087 --> 02:04:57,897
That is all. Is it not?

1272
02:05:00,059 --> 02:05:04,201
All these emotions and ramifications
of sorrow, that is all pointless.

1273
02:05:04,897 --> 02:05:06,672
Must stroll on in the path decided,

1274
02:05:06,866 --> 02:05:10,313
- as long as you hear
the drum beat. That is all.

1275
02:05:11,170 --> 02:05:12,672
When the drum beat is over...

1276
02:05:12,838 --> 02:05:15,148
Once the drum beat is
over, doesn't anyone walk?

1277
02:05:15,274 --> 02:05:17,720
Don't they need to go home
after this drum beat and parade?

1278
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:28,093
Home!

1279
02:05:34,593 --> 02:05:37,631
Do not take any articles that
will fetch money on selling.

1280
02:05:37,730 --> 02:05:39,038
Keep it where it is.

1281
02:05:39,164 --> 02:05:44,011
Is it not a palace to
snatch everything and go?

1282
02:05:44,303 --> 02:05:52,518
Will hang! Not me, but him,
will hang on the rope!

1283
02:05:52,645 --> 02:05:55,888
When one is suspended, he will
hang, men will be hangedl...

1284
02:05:56,115 --> 02:05:58,095
Like the one, who
got hanged in Gulf!

1285
02:05:58,217 --> 02:06:03,223
Was a brave man! What
was his name? What was that?

1286
02:06:03,889 --> 02:06:04,765
Sadam Hussain.

1287
02:06:04,957 --> 02:06:07,062
Yes, that is the one,
so leave that matter.

1288
02:06:19,505 --> 02:06:20,916
Anna, did you
recognize this person?

1289
02:06:23,142 --> 02:06:26,214
He had left the country long ago.
Saw him in that nearby shop.

1290
02:06:26,345 --> 02:06:27,517
He insisted he wants to meet you.

1291
02:06:27,646 --> 02:06:31,458
Get out from here!
It had happened long ago.

1292
02:06:31,684 --> 02:06:34,221
Get out!
You come here.

1293
02:06:34,353 --> 02:06:37,334

You stay there itself!

What pathetic?

1297
02:06:56,809 --> 02:06:59,790
It had happened long ago, is it not?

1298
02:07:00,045 --> 02:07:03,322
Saw him at the road side,
insisted on seeing you.

1299
02:07:03,515 --> 02:07:06,257
That is why I brought him,Anna
please go and talk to him.

1300
02:07:07,353 --> 02:07:12,826
For a long time, just wanted to
see and tell this. It is not possible,

1301
02:07:12,992 --> 02:07:15,700
if I don't tell this at least now.

1302
02:07:15,828 --> 02:07:16,898

1304
02:07:51,664 --> 02:07:53,234
Anna did he go?

1305
02:07:53,999 --> 02:07:57,139
For the time being let her stay here,

1306
02:07:57,336 --> 02:07:58,940
- then who is that good for
nothing fellow, who came now?

See, you are physically not fit,

these kind of men to your house?

1309

You shut your mouth!

1310

whom you are talking to?

Do you know that? Let your Mother
stay here, if you want to and you go!

Go. Isav 9°!

Just plead and consternate,
do not speak a word!

we desperately need it.

So do not utter a word!

1318
02:08:43,148 --> 02:08:44,320
Will you speak out anything?

1319
02:08:56,528 --> 02:08:58,667
Don't you remember
everything I told you,

1320
02:08:58,831 --> 02:09:01,107
do not create a scene, come.

1321
02:09:03,368 --> 02:09:06,247
Nobody create any issues, comrade
had told, that is why he is here.

1322
02:09:06,371 --> 02:09:08,851
Let him go and meet him.
After that we'll decide later.

like that! Come man!

I have only one issue. You bet
our children! Nothing more to do.

1328
02:09:56,889 --> 02:10:03,568
You go out and tell them by folded
hands like this! Just tell them.

to beat you. My apologies...

Be cool man!
Tell apologies!

Tell your apologies and go man!

front on any issues.

...where 'Lal' (RED) not a mere
color but is a precious pride...

...where it is a higher thought.

I wanted to peruse a new course?

1445
02:23:01,806 --> 02:23:04,878

particular course is only there

Can I come along with you?

02:23:15,019 --> 02:23:20,196
...after closing the bank account
and got on the train along with us...

was not the only reason...

had told was tutored only in one college.

That too in a college where BBVP
ruled the sole territory!

1454

The party had insisted that comrade
Anitha must be enrolled in that college.

1455

...as the first YFI student...

1456
02:23:48,753 --> 02:23:51,495
And YFI unit must be
started in that college...

To host the Red Flag over there,

1458
02:23:54,225 --> 02:23:56,501
...Kaitheri Sahadevan was
delegated to come there...

1459
02:23:56,761 --> 02:23:58,502
...who was the leader of the
youth wing during those times

1460

same as the color of the flag.

How much you shed blood here,
you cannot 'redden' the color of the soil.

The communist shed blood
not to redden the soil...

as the heat of the sun...

...Communism is a shady tree
in this soil, sheltering the poor...

1503
02:27:51,629 --> 02:27:54,735
After a week comrade Roy came
to see comrade Anitha at the college.

1504
02:27:55,633 --> 02:27:57,135
I was also present along with him.

1505
02:28:02,707 --> 02:28:07,707

1506
02:29:34,398 --> 02:29:39,074
Comrade, it is betrayal!
Comrade! Someone help!

1507
02:29:52,516 --> 02:29:56,589
This is the person who
chopped comrade Roy on that day.

1508
02:29:59,623 --> 02:30:06,097
But I'm damn sure that it was
not done by BBVP activist, ask him.

1509
02:30:08,733 --> 02:30:10,406
Who had instructed to chop?

1510
02:30:12,703 --> 02:30:13,977
That is...

1511
02:30:23,914 --> 02:30:27,487
Hey you be prepared the
bail is going to be cancelled.

1512
02:30:50,441 --> 02:30:52,284
Have been changed
to Operation Theater.

1513
02:31:11,095 --> 02:31:13,473
I tried to locate the
vein in the left leg.

1514
02:31:16,067 --> 02:31:20,174
That leg is paralyzed, doctor
you will not get the vein on that.

1516
02:32:53,097 --> 02:32:56,977
He is the one who did like
this...And still...! No need!

1517
02:33:03,641 --> 02:33:06,121
'Kaitheri Sahadevan'

1518
02:33:36,507 --> 02:33:45,689
You got sister for you,
I'm leaving okay, and I'm leaving!

1519
02:34:04,868 --> 02:34:06,142
Pardon!

1520
02:34:25,623 --> 02:34:26,465
Pardon!

1521
02:34:48,646 --> 02:34:50,455
By afternoon you must
be present at the court.

1522
02:34:53,917 --> 02:34:55,191
There is an issue.

1523
02:34:58,022 --> 02:34:59,330
One gold and one metta pan.

1524
02:35:13,637 --> 02:35:15,947
Sahadevan had
strived through hunger,

1525
02:35:16,907 --> 02:35:18,682
had seen the Fathefs and
Father's bothers blood sheds!

1526
02:35:19,043 --> 02:35:23,685
From that day on wards
it had commenced!

1527
02:35:24,315 --> 02:35:28,559
But some will say,
I will not preach all this,

1528
02:35:29,320 --> 02:35:33,325
I'm telling this so that
everyone hears very well.

1529
02:35:34,725 --> 02:35:39,401
My biggest foe is, one who
endangers the party from inside.

1530
02:35:40,097 --> 02:35:42,839
Then journalist will say, Sahadevan
is a contemptible fellow!

1531
02:35:43,400 --> 02:35:44,970
Merciless guy, with no blood in eyes!

1532
02:35:45,602 --> 02:35:49,414
That is all...Like this to me!

1533
02:35:50,007 --> 02:35:53,284
On seeing own blood
dried up in soil,

1534
02:35:53,911 --> 02:35:56,892
the blood must be in the
hand not in the eyes!

1535
02:36:24,608 --> 02:36:27,987
Last week the intelligence
people had called me...

1536
02:36:29,246 --> 02:36:32,284
...They are saying Naxalist have hooked!

1537
02:36:33,016 --> 02:36:36,793
These Naxalist are some of
the fools in Communist!

1538
02:36:38,222 --> 02:36:41,965
An army had started
from Telungana to kill Sahadevan!

1539
02:36:42,893 --> 02:36:45,874
Let them come, let everyone come!

1540
02:36:46,697 --> 02:36:50,440
Nobody can touch my mere hair!

1541
02:37:01,612 --> 02:37:02,249
He is the one!

1542
02:37:07,484 --> 02:37:08,155
<i>Jayan W“ 9°'-!</i>

1543
02:37:11,288 --> 02:37:13,825
How many times will you
ask the same thing? I will stay.

1544
02:37:20,998 --> 02:37:24,104
Hey you, wait there, why are you here!

1545
02:37:24,435 --> 02:37:25,675
Came to see sir.

1546
02:37:25,903 --> 02:37:26,745
What for?

1547
02:37:27,371 --> 02:37:28,907
Sir told me to come here.

1548
02:37:39,416 --> 02:37:40,156
What is it man!

1550
02:38:24,928 --> 02:38:28,535
Closing the eyes!

1551
02:38:32,302 --> 02:38:34,680
Tell them to move aside!

1552
02:38:51,788 --> 02:38:52,892
Move back you!

1553
02:39:18,815 --> 02:39:21,557
It has been one year since Roy had left.

1554
02:39:24,988 --> 02:39:28,026
Jayan's mercy petition's
information was known today

1555
02:39:28,392 --> 02:39:32,534
Feels like crying whenever
thinking of him. But will never cry.

1556
02:39:33,030 --> 02:39:37,206
Like what Roy told, death is only
the continuation of life!

1557
02:39:45,042 --> 02:39:50,458
Mother is there, for her I'm there.
We never used to talk about Roy or Jayan.

1558
02:39:51,949 --> 02:39:57,023
Now, I came to understand one thing,
that 'l' and 'her' arethe true communist!

"Might fall down...As the limbs go weak,
body gets fatigue, but must stride on"

1560

place, sprouts in three varied patterns"

"What I have seen, is it
the same what you have seen?"

1564
02:41:09,426 --> 02:41:13,306
"What we have seen today,
might be also a trickery"

1565
02:41:13,430 --> 02:41:21,315
