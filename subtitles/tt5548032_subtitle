1
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:35,145
''l am sitting with sharpness''

2
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:39,746
''Ready to cut off the black fingers
pointing at me''

3
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,512
''l brought up within me this dark serpent
Takshaka''

4
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,991
''Death, ready to collapse, is near''

5
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:53,588
''For the pure soul to rise up free from
impurity,''

6
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:58,964
''Limbless one, your strong fort
will be thoroughly devastated''

7
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:37,203
Team DrC

8
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,609
Things can be fixed as discussed,
can't we, Jayaraman?

9
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,283
When my Uncle is here, l have no say, right?

10
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:50,179
Being the head of the family, l'll give the word!

11
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:54,650
But if you try to back-off
at the nick of the moment...

12
00:04:55,161 --> 00:04:57,629
then, l will take back my words!

13
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,361
lt's you who should take care of the things
here.

14
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:04,959
We are just going to execute the decision taken
by the boy and the girl who love each other.

15
00:05:05,171 --> 00:05:06,638
-That's all-Yes that's all

16
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:11,041
A girl from your family
coming to our family is itself the biggest wealth!

17
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:15,313
Still, all the formalities have to be finalized,
right?

18
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,979
Everything will be done as promised.

19
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,909
Go ahead and fix an auspicious date.

20
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:24,680
That bugger is coming.
l guess he may botch this proposal!

21
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:30,253
So everything as discussed and finalized!

22
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,359
Just inform us after fixing an auspicious date

23
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,335
-Please hold.-No need

24
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,604
Blindness has never been an obstacle for my
brother!

25
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,907
ln fact, he knows the
surroundings better than us.

26
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,176
lsn't Lakshmi here?

27
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,873
-Yes, brother.-Come here.

28
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:56,046
-Are you happy?-Yeah

29
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:00,255
Don't worry, this brother will
take care of everything..okay.

30
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,265
Did l ask him to pledge this house
and land for Bhaputty?

31
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,135
lt's not a meager sum.

32
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:17,343
But l lent him around 25 lakhs!

33
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,644
Now it's almost 2 years.

34
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:22,104
The Principal and interest amount mounted
now.

35
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,011
There is no way for income at all

36
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:28,879
Either you repay my debt or
l will sell this house and land.

37
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,953
and l'll give the balance amount, if any left

38
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,225
Nothing more to say. Move.

39
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,220
Aunty, Gomathy's chain and bangles are in this.

40
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:39,329
Return them.

41
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,237
l saw you agreeing to all
the demands of groom's family.

42
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:51,034
But l have not seen this girl adorned
with gold ornaments of her own.

43
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,802
Going with our family status,

44
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,878
ls it possible for you to perform this marriage
in a simple way at least?

45
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,881
l already explained my plight.
l'm a bit tight now.

46
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,187
As if only now!

47
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:04,049
Don't you know, Madhavan,

48
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,859
When his father Ramunni passed away,

49
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:09,057
Jayaraman was only 20 yrs old.

50
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,853
Kannan 10 yrs and Lakshmi was 7.

51
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:17,161
By cleaning temple premises, beating drums,

52
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,032
he educated both of them.

53
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,137
Even now, the monthly expenses are met ,

54
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:27,210
with rent amount from the shop
he acquired with great difficulty.

55
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,176
-No, aunty.. - You keep quiet.

56
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,374
Don't waste time talking old stories!
Try to reach home before dark.

57
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:35,384
Everybody has their own hardships!

58
00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:37,956
The only thing that this family
has now is this house and land!

59
00:07:38,157 --> 00:07:42,116
When pledged them for someone else's sake,
nobody has any complaints, right?

60
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:43,388
Has anyone?

61
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:46,995
Get me something to eat!

62
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,029
Next month, Varghese will lock the house.

63
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,135
We'll have to leave from there.

64
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:55,798
Haven't you told Groom's family,
one share of the property belongs to Lakshmi?

65
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,942
Baputty and me are childhood friends.

66
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,941
When he had an urgent need, l helped him.

67
00:08:00,112 --> 00:08:02,046
As you have no family,
you can live on streets also, brother.

68
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:03,044
What about us?

69
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:04,873
Baputty will not cheat me.

70
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,151
Last month also, l spoke to him.

71
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,180
He promised to repay this debt
as soon as he returns from Doha.

72
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,795
Going back home?

73
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,198
Oh Kunjanja, anything caught in the bait?

74
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,164
No! l'm sitting since morning.

75
00:08:25,238 --> 00:08:26,170
Time is 7 '0 clock!

76
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,901
lt'll take another 10-15 minutes
forthe boat to come!

77
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:33,141
Give me the fishing rod. Let me give a try.

78
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,349
Panicker, you are too bad.

79
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,185
You promised to come to Kalari
to show martial arts to children.

80
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,116
ln fact, l had come there.

81
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:51,154
When you were dancing in front of an English
woman,

82
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,194
l went back.

83
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:58,793
Hey Kuruppu, this Kalari and Kathakali
are both a part of our culture

84
00:08:58,971 --> 00:09:05,570
This art was created by our ancestral gurus
after years of research in the human anatomy

85
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,338
lf the body wants to be an eye, the martial steps

86
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:09,347
should be thoroughly learnt
from childhood itself

87
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:13,579
This cannot be created
in a capsule model by creating publicity,

88
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,455
after taking photo of Old English woman orfilm

89
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,185
actress in kalari attire and
putting in the facebook page.

90
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:22,023
One who's learnt Kalari,
should be conscious enough to notice,

91
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,128
even the blink of an eye!

92
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,597
Like this!

93
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:29,623
lt's a stingy catfish ah!

94
00:09:30,036 --> 00:09:32,095
How did you know?

95
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,637
l can feel in the rod from its throb!

96
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,237
My Goodness! Where were you?

97
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,581
''Smell of Camphor is coming, O Wind!''

98
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:54,652
O Priest! Where are you going?

99
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,587
Oh you, Raman! l didn't see you!

100
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,059
lt's me who can't see you,
but what's the problem with you?

101
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:05,101
lt's long time since he borrowed Rs.2000 from
me!

102
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,637
So even if he doesn't notice me,
l can't blame him.

103
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:08,974
That's right!

104
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:09,574
l will repay it immediately

105
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,576
l'll give it to your younger brother next week.

106
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:24,989
-lt's an utter lie - What?

107
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,651
That Jayaraman is blind.

108
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:33,588
He can see everything. Simply cheating people.

109
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,567
-Where are you going, Gopaletta? -
Chottanikara!

110
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,669
Navarathri is ahead!

111
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,064
lt's been a long time since l listened to
Neelambari!

112
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,511
Listening to Sandhya Ragam
(Tune of the Twilight) is a feast for the ears!

113
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,705
You're right! Won't it take a long time to reach
Kochi?

114
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:53,643
Why don't we sing, then?

115
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:37,494
Chinnamma, Hey Kunhipennamma, in
Thiruvallikavu temple there are a 1000 elephants

116

playfully in the clear water?''

123
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:26,476

127
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,671
''The sound of rustling sesame seeds in
the ears, the violin-play in the breeze''

128
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:35,145
''Blowing a small bugle, the rhythm
of angry oracles dancing;''

129
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,550
''When the beat of drums is rising in frenzy, ''

130
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:42,084
''And when l go to light the twilight lamp,''

131
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:48,753
''To complete the array, is the sky
too lighting little wicks?''

132
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:55,897
''There is red sandalwood paste on the
forehead; and Neelambari tune in the veena.''

Team DrC

144
00:15:04,436 --> 00:15:04,697
Sorry!

145
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:38,495
Rs.50!

146
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:49,313
Papa asked to change the bulb!

147
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,879
Don't worry, l will get the electrician tomorrow.

148
00:15:51,717 --> 00:15:52,843
-Where are you going? - Tuition.

149
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,886
- Did you arrange the money?-No!

150
00:16:01,593 --> 00:16:02,685
How much do you have to give?

151
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,662
-How much?- l need at least Rs 26 !

152
00:16:08,367 --> 00:16:10,528
Just that! Couldn't you ask me?

153
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:11,927
What, 26 lakhs?!

154
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:13,935
Oh my God! Lakhs?

155
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:17,309
Or would anybody pledge a house for Rs.26?

156
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,677
ls it like that in Malapuram area?

157
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,711
Tell me the truth, were you a sweeper
in the army?

158
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,441
No wonder how these Chinese
captured all our places.

159
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,320
How will you arrange such a big amount?

160
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:29,554
Don't keep harping on it.

161
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,814
l will have to hand overthis in each house.

162
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,855
ls Devayani around here to hand over this?

163
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:37,292
-Didn't you know that? - What?

164
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,697
-Entire Police force came to her house!-What?

165
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,861
Her ex-husband, Majid,

166
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:45,730
ls Majid, Devayani's husband?

167
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:46,633
lt's Madhu!

168
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,567
l don't know his name.

169
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:52,302
He and one of his police friends

170
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,275
went into her house in inebriation
and created nuisance.

171
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:54,844
Then?

172
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,443
Her brother, what is his name...

173
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:58,446
Name not necessary, come to the point,

174
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,818
-He brandished with what he got in his hand!
-Really? Then?

175
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,477
That fellow fled away.

176
00:17:02,654 --> 00:17:04,645
Seems that Policeman broke his head..

177
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:06,824
..Killed or almost dying..Heard so!

178
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,517
Situation worsened.

179
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,629
Police team went to Bangalore
in search of her brother.

180
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:14,561
As they couldn't nab him,
they detained Devayani.

181
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:17,702
Atlast she was freed
only after ourJudge interfered.

182
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:23,799
-Good morning, Jayaram bro!
- Good morning, Ramesh!

183
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:28,113
Who eats all this stuff at crack of dawn?

184
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:31,773
Would like to know Uncle's plan!

185
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,553
You have FD of 1 Crore rupees in the Bank.

186
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,815
Why can't you give him 25 lakhs from that?

187
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:42,420
lsn't he your only nephew?

188
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:43,720
Moreover, you neither have a family nor a child!

189
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,425
Yes, he has a daughter!

190
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,792
lf public knows, Justice Krishnamoorthy's
honour will fly in the air!

191
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:52,437
lt's not from his legal affair, right?

192
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:53,696
That's the reason for concealing it.

193
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,808
Don't everthink of giving ourfamily property
to the child from an extramarital affair!

194
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:02,413
Sister, l've told you several times
not to come here for discussing such things.

195
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:05,413
Come, mother.

196
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,461
Oh, you've come!

197
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,393
What's that Jayraman?

198
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:21,692
Few ripened mangoes!

199
00:18:22,134 --> 00:18:23,533
Don't you know l shouldn't take sweets?

200
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:27,105
You can eat this adding some curd to it!
Nothing will happen.

201
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,733
Such mangoes are not available
anywhere now.

202
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,506
-The incident happened to her ...
-l came to know...

203
00:18:31,643 --> 00:18:32,473
Kunjakka told me.

204
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,080
l'm leaving. Your lunch is kept in the fridge.

205
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,744
l will try to reach at the time of lunch.

206
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,507
l will take care.

207
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,151
You need to go to many more flats, right?

208
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,053
Don't lose yourjob offending people.

209
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:45,652
Handover this in Sardarji's house.

210
00:18:46,091 --> 00:18:47,490
And this forAdvocate madam.

211
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,391
Pillaichettan's shop will be closed for 3 days.

212
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,497
lf you give me this month's provision list,
shall get them before dusk.

213
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,162
lf Secretary doesn't see me
in the lift after 6 ' 0 clock,

214
00:18:57,569 --> 00:18:59,127
he will start barking.

215
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:00,529
Will give you the list tomorrow.

216
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,170
Then, we need to set out for one more journey.

217
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,010
When shall we go, sir?.

218
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,205
As you are piled up with work here,
l have to see your convenience also.

219
00:19:12,451 --> 00:19:17,081
Blind school Principal, RK Nair..l met him.
One of my old friends.

220
00:19:17,456 --> 00:19:20,118
Seems you are teaching Music
for the children there.

221
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,527
Just like that! lt's fun to be with children.

222
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,219
And also to impart whatever l learnt.
lt will be useful forthem.

223
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:29,693
Principal is trying to making yourjob,
permanent there.

224
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,468
lf that is done, quit this lift operatorjob.

225
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:38,439
l've just come. No problem here.

226
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,705
l've told you the plans, right?

227
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:44,011
Okay! No one will know.

228
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,018
See you in the evening. Love you.

229
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,558
What time are you coming for work?

230
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,062
What is the problem?

231
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,926
Not even a day, he was punctual for work.

232
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,829
Comes up with different excuses every day.

233
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,936
What is the excuse for today?
Yourfatherjumped into the well?

234
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:09,263
Henceforth, if you come
with any excuses in the morning,

235
00:20:09,608 --> 00:20:10,939
You will be thrown out of yourjob!
Understood?

236
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,977
l'm leaving for hometown.
Will return only after 30 days.

237
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,911
Here is the key.

238
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,948
Call someone from workshop and disconnect
my Car's battery.

239
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:21,813
Get it cleaned once in a while.
Give the key in my office.

240
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:28,087
Jayaram, tell to check the pipe on the 4th floor.

241
00:20:28,293 --> 00:20:29,885
Somewhere there is a block! Heard me?

242
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:32,826
You have enough work here, right?

243
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,760
Don't keep chatting!
Wash the Car and go to school.

244
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,291
Team DrC

245
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,767
lf it's for such a long journey,
we could've taken a driver.

246
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:49,310
No Jayaraman, this journey will lead
to my last stage of investigation.

247
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:51,783
l need to handle with care.

248
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,812
Shouldn't involve any 3rd person from outside!

249
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:16,967
-Sir, lottery tickets. 5 Crores is the Bumper!
-No, please.

250
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,777
-One Karunya(Mercy) ticket please! - No.

251
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:22,105
-Sir, please..this is the first sale
-Okay, give me one.

252
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,173
Now, you will have to
show some mercy towards me!

253
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,978
You know where is Shrank Bhaskar's house?

254
00:21:28,186 --> 00:21:29,118
Shrank?

255
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,119
Sir, you mean the person
who hacked Amberi Achu to death.

256
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,951
l'm not sure whether he hacked him.

257
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,126
But he was sentenced to a life imprisonment.

258
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,954
Then, he is the person.

259
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,756
Go straight, you will find a pipe on the road
side.

260
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:41,124
Straight opposite to it, is the house.

261
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:50,031
Sir, that is the house.

262
00:22:12,764 --> 00:22:17,758
- Baskaran?-Hmm! Who are you?

263
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:24,039
Don't you know Vasudevan, yourjail mate?

264
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,303
l would like to know some details about him.

265
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:02,170
Come Nandana, let's go.

266
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,043
Sir, is anybody following us?

267
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,944
No!

268
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,882
While we were going there,
coming here and also now,

269
00:23:43,822 --> 00:23:45,790
did the same vehicle go past us?
Did you notice it, sir?.

270
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:49,688
You must have felt so, Jayraman!
What happened?

271
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:50,795
Just like that l asked.

272
00:23:55,901 --> 00:24:01,965
For a long time, l've been travelling
along with you to many places.

273
00:24:02,908 --> 00:24:08,869
But till now, you didn't
even ask a word about it.

274
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,008
Yeah, l have not asked you a word about it, sir.

275
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,112
Also about Nandinimol.

276
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,184
l've got many questions in my mind.

277
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,827
''What is the need to hide your daughter and
live?''

278
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:24,119
''Who is her mother''

279
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,759
''Why making her call me as Ramaacha''

280
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:31,797
''Why making me tell lies for all her questions''

281
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:33,127
And these journeys...?

282
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:35,738
Like these, l got 1000 questions in my mind.

283
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:39,738
But l didn't ask you anything.
You know why, sir?

284
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,036
One shouldn't know what
he's not supposed to know

285
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,876
Or will know only when he is destined so!
l thought so.

286
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,446
This mindset of yours is what
created a bond between us!

287
00:24:51,923 --> 00:24:54,153
That doesn't exist even in a blood relationship!

288
00:24:55,927 --> 00:25:02,025
But now l feel it's time to
disclose certain things to you.

289
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:14,539
lt was around 10 - 14 yrs back,
l was a High Court Judge then.

290
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,779
One youth, Vasudevan was presented
before me for a murder case!

291
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,145
One Mr.Appu Master's son!

292
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,054
He was an accountant in a Sait's company.

293
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,018
Case was Vasudevan raped and killed the
maid of Sait's house.

294
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:33,564
Before the verdict,

295
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:38,560
he requested for a personal talk in my
Chamber.

296
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:44,598
With an outburst of tears,
he claimed he was innocent!

297
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:50,174
Being a Judge, l can't turn
a blind eye to evidences, can l?

298
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,214
l sentenced him with life imprisonment.

299
00:25:58,957 --> 00:26:01,824
Later, because of dire situation and shame,

300
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,426
that Master's family, including his wife,

301
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,827
7 members consumed poison and committed
suicide.

302
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,924
Something provoked me to go to that spot.

303
00:26:14,472 --> 00:26:17,498
Over there, l saw him standing
along with the Policemen.

304
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:22,639
He had flaring eyes
which can burn down the entire World.

305
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:28,078
Condemning for the grave crime,
he pointed his finger at me.

306
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,917
He murmured something.

307
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:36,883
Before those heaps of corpses, the tug of War
between Law, Justice and Conscience..

308
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,995
rocked my mind very badly!

309
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,933
Still l've not overcome from it!

310
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,903
A few years later, l got retired from
Supreme Court and settled in hometown.

311
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:54,042
l went to Jail enquiring about him.

312
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,377
By then he was released after serving the
sentence.

313
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:01,350
From there l came to know that,

314
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,888
ln the shock of seeing the dead bodies of his
family,

315
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,415
he became a mental patient.

316
00:27:07,692 --> 00:27:11,458
Then, nearly forfour years,
he was in the mental hospital.

317
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,899
Vasu who returned to Jail after the treatment,

318
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:21,368
Before walking out from there,
he had scribbled something in the prison,

319
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,062
l read them.

320
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:28,469
Behind those Crazy lines ,
there was some strong inner meaning!

321
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:39,719
As an atonement for my guilt, with a hope
that l can give him a better life again,

322
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,085
l started searching for Vasu for some more
years.

323
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:47,096
l just wished to see him...
wanted a chance to tell him

324
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,696
lt is that investigation which is going on even
now!

325
00:27:52,937 --> 00:28:26,330
Team DrC

326
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,467
What does the Post mortem report say?

327
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,708
-Was he drunk?-Report doesn't say so

328
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:43,408
Reason for death says,
the impact of falling from top!

329
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,775
There are no other reasons to prove
it's not a suicide.

330
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:50,348
Then why was this case sent to crime branch
saying the relatives are creating a ruckus!

331
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,218
But there is an interesting point in that FlR.

332
00:29:53,424 --> 00:29:53,685
What is that?

333
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,819
The footprints found on the spot where he
jumped was not that of the shoes he wore!

334
00:29:58,396 --> 00:29:59,590
That belongs to somebody else.

335
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,530
That may be, of the one who pushed him down.

336
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,262
-lf so, shouldn't there be signs of a struggle!
- Hmm!

337
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,501
l guess you are being transferred!

338
00:30:10,708 --> 00:30:12,471
Yes! Today is my last day here.

339
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:20,440
This is a case l was investigating.

340
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,620
Nobody entrusted this to me. l did it on my
interest.

341
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:24,778
lf you are interested, you can continue.

342
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:26,355
All details are in this.

343
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:28,782
These deaths occurred at 5 different spots.

344
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,362
1st death was Kozhikode Karthik Sait's

345
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,259
Died of gas cylinder blast on last Diwali.

346
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,363
That's in October.

347
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:43,204
Next, DYSPAhmed and wife, who
were returning from Mambaram Church festival,

348
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:44,670
died when Car fell into the river.

349
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:50,577
Then, one doctor Joseph Charlie and his wife,
died of a boat accident in Thekkady.

350
00:30:52,283 --> 00:30:52,544
See this,

351
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:55,709
retired Public Prosecutor Nambiar,
drowned in Aluva river!

352
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,786
l was probing only that case.

353
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:06,825
See this.

354
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:11,294
lT student who came back from US
after completing his studies

355
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,761
Vijayakrishnan, only son of deceased Nambiar,

356
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:17,798
jumped from his flat terrace and committed
suicide.

357
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:20,536
That Case is on your head, now.

358
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:23,213
Nambiar who drowned and died was highly
inebriated.

359
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:26,379
So not sure whether it was an accident or
suicide.

360
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,710
Just a week after that was his son's death!

361
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:33,481
But relatives say they had no problems
emotionally or financially!

362
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,218
Not even a suicide note was found from both of
them.

363
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:39,419
All these incidents happened
in different places at different times in Kerala!

364
00:31:39,597 --> 00:31:41,531
Why do you interlink all this?

365
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:45,293
All of them died along with their entire family

366
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,267
Also index fingers were cut off from all the
deceased.

367
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,404
Based on the nature of death, nobody noticed
it.

368
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,207
You think somebody is behind this?

369
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,715
That is the reason l investigated this case.

370
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:00,611
There are some more details in this file.

371
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:06,256
Better burn it sir! Don't get into trouble.

372
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:15,623
Hey Beeran!

373
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,725
Oh God! l told you 100 times,
l'm Veeran and not Beeran

374
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:23,964
We are calling the same God as Allah, Jesus
and Ayyappa!

375
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,310
So what's wrong in calling you so!

376
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:27,671
Do you call mother as father
and father as mother?

377
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:28,711
Forget it.

378
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:31,680
lsn't a flat locked on the 11th floor?

379
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:32,681
So what?

380
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:36,685
l doubt seeing a shadow in that room yesterday

381
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:38,511
On that floor?.

382
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:44,017
No way! That must be Devayani.

383
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,659
She is been entrusted to
clean a couple of locked flats.

384
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,356
Does she clean at midnight?

385
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,330
Won't she leave at 6 p.m?

386
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:51,433
-Mightjust be your imagination!. - Don't scare
me also.

387
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:55,362
Are you talking about the 11th floor or 6th
floor?

388
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,669
lf you ask me so, then l will get confused.

389
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,509
lrony is he doesn't even remember people's
names, then what to say about floor !

390
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,311
On 6th floor, 605 is vacant.

391
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,317
That flat is for rent out - for Military man, right?

392
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:14,525
When l was returning
after giving betel leaf to its adjacent flat,

393
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,522
l heard some movements in that flat.

394
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,962
l knocked on the door, then
there were no movements.

395
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:19,555
Really a bad situation!

396
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:23,292
Those times we got chances of knowing
our neighbours well.

397
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,537
When the flat system came, people
just sit at locked doors.

398
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:34,036
Nobody knows who our neighbour is,
whether he is Jaffer, Sherif or Mohammad!

399
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,045
What happened? Any problem here?

400
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,417
Sardarji's daughter is missing.

401
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:46,388
She left for beauty parlour at 5 p.m

402
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,650
But she didn't show up there!

403
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:49,960
Her phone is also switched off!

404
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,686
Someone check for her in Marine Drive.

405
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:52,562
Why over there?

406
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,555
Kiss of Love protest takes place there only

407
00:33:54,999 --> 00:33:56,091
Don't talk nonsense.

408
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,958
No, l really mean it.

409
00:33:58,436 --> 00:33:59,960
-That Menon's son.. - you mean Ravi?

410
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:04,575
Yeah, l saw him and Sardarji's daughter doing
Kissing of love protest in the Car park!

411
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:05,939
l will call you the next time.

412
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,112
Although you will not be able to see,
you can at least listen to its sound.

413
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:09,435
That girl normally goes by Scooty, is it?

414
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,544
Yes!

415
00:34:10,681 --> 00:34:11,943
Check if her vehicle is there..

416
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:13,447
Yes! Let me check.

417
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:17,087
May be partying with some friends!

418
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:19,482
Someone call up her friends' houses and
check.

419
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,387
About which Mohammed are you talking about?

420
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,494
Mohammed?! We are talking about Sardaji's
daughter.

421
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:25,424
Hell with him!

422
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:28,929
Scooty is here.

423
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,499
Kunjakka come here.

424
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,630
Sardarji, everyone come with me.

425
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:46,072
-Get 605 room's key from Menon sir. - Ok

426
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:58,924
Why you need to open this? Nobody is inside.

427
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,495
Someone is inside. Open the door.

428
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:02,398
Who will be inside the locked room?

429
00:35:02,967 --> 00:35:04,935
What's wrong in opening the door?

430
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:05,602
Please open and check.

431
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:12,474
What should l do next?

432
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,468
Any one get inside and check.

433
00:35:19,917 --> 00:35:20,849
Who are you looking for?.

434
00:35:50,181 --> 00:35:51,148
Hey you!

435
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,147
All of you please sit. Please sit.

436
00:35:57,455 --> 00:36:00,447
Association needn't decide about my son's
marriage.

437
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:04,025
Your son has made a grave mistake to my
daughter.

438
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,230
This will turn to big turmoil here!

439
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,129
Let me give you a good decision.

440
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:15,066
Krishnamoorthy sir, we are not suggesting
anything.

441
00:36:15,907 --> 00:36:20,105
You are highly a reputable person in the
Society!

442
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:23,472
Obviously, your decision will always be a fair
one.

443
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,249
No sir, you will have to tell a decision in this.

444
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,979
lt's not enough if you alone say

445
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:36,183
Only if everybody agrees, l will tell my opinion.

446
00:36:40,164 --> 00:36:43,463
lt's the matter of their lives.

447
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,129
They have the
age, rights and wisdom to decide about it.

448
00:36:48,172 --> 00:36:50,572
Needn't get afraid of anyone

449
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:52,770
Speak openly.

450
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:56,011
-Do you love her? - Yes

451
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,144
What about you?

452
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:58,246
Hmm!

453
00:37:00,151 --> 00:37:04,247
Do you wish to marry and lead a happy life?

454
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:09,254
So you mean to say parents have no rights
to decide about their children's life!

455
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,260
Two different places, languages, customs
traditions and people!

456
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:13,528
How does it match?

457
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,157
Definitely it will end up in divorce.

458
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,830
Times are different now, Menon.

459
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,127
Both of you should understand one thing.

460
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:22,862
Nowadays, whether you buy a dog, cow or a
horse,

461
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,837
they will have their own pedigrees!

462
00:37:25,042 --> 00:37:25,974
l mean the lineage!

463
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,973
Jegveer sing's family is an elite family.

464
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,176
And yours is also the same, Menon!

465
00:37:29,814 --> 00:37:31,782
These children also have that lineage

466
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,244
Only that is needed, Menon.

467
00:37:34,185 --> 00:37:37,916
Both of you come to my flat this evening,

468
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:39,350
along with your families.

469
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:42,019
We will arrive at a final decision there.

470
00:37:42,126 --> 00:38:05,814
Team DrC

471
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:31,036
Hey!

472
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,373
Hey, stand there!

473
00:39:01,772 --> 00:39:02,739
Sorry!

474
00:39:10,781 --> 00:39:12,646
l got something to tell you.

475
00:39:12,917 --> 00:39:13,611
What's it, sir?

476
00:39:14,785 --> 00:39:17,345
-l saw him.-Who?

477
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,512
A person like Vasu!

478
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:21,888
Like Vasu?

479
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,490
No! He is Vasu!

480
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:29,898
Before l could talk anything, he walked away.

481
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:32,160
Then?

482
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:35,636
You..

483
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:49,118
You need to go to Nandini's place immediately.

484
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:56,060
Apart from the number given by you,

485
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,258
Even if you call me,
l will not talk about Nandini! Enough?

486
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:01,725
That's enough! Thank you!

487
00:40:03,701 --> 00:40:05,396
-Good morning! - Good morning!

488
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,206
Your Ramachhan has come! Both of you have a
good weekend.

489
00:40:10,641 --> 00:40:12,233
What is wrong with you, Ramachhan?

490
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:15,240
Who will abduct this abandoned child?

491
00:40:15,646 --> 00:40:17,477
Who told that you are an abandoned child?

492
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:19,148
This Ramachhan needs you!

493
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,985
There's nothing wrong, if people call you a liar!

494
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:33,695
Why?

495
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,700
lf you'v e no eye sight, then
how did you catch the ball?

496
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,572
-Oh! That is a trick! - To hell with your trick!

497
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,506
What all lies you told me?

498
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:48,408
You will bring my father and mother. All white
lies!

499
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:52,413
Earlier when you gave me balloons
and chocolates,l believed your words.

500
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,218
Now this Nandini is not a kid, you know?

501
00:40:54,218 --> 00:40:56,652
Really? This poor Ramachhan didn't know,

502
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,551
that Nandini dear has grown up!

503
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,789
You know why l don't ask you anything now/

504
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:06,830
lf l ask you more questions and corner you,

505
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,694
then, fearing me, if you also avoid coming here,

506
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,098
who else do l have then?

507
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:14,228
This Ramachhan now promises Nandinikutty

508
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:17,368
Next time along with Ramachhan,
there will be another person.

509
00:41:18,576 --> 00:41:19,167
Who?

510
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:22,742
Nandinikutty's father!

511
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:27,206
l will put your tender hands onto his big hands
and say..

512
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:31,487
''Better take her away,
l'm tired of bearing this burden''

513
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,384
Shoo..Shoo..Shoo!

514
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:41,195
lt's not pack of lies!! lt's my word!

515
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:46,528
-l bought a gift and kept it in my box!
- For whom?

516
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:47,500
For you only!

517
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,596
For me??!

518
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:53,442
Don't l need to gift you in return
for bringing my father one day?

519
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,435
So l bought it and kept.

520
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,581
l'm sure it will not happen.

521
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:02,209
Even otherwise, why does Nandini need a
father now?

522
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:06,188
Just assume my father has come..

523
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:09,521
What can he do bigger than you?

524
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:15,657
This Ramachhan will cajole and cheat me!
Big liar!

525
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:20,029
You promised to teach a song
to sing in School and absconded last time!

526
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,104
Only now you have sprung up.

527
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:23,766
Only 4 more days left for the Annual day.

528
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:24,771
That is also gone!

529
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:31,437
Who said it's gone?This Ramachhan
will go only after teaching my firefly a song.

530
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,618
l came here with a song in my pocket!

531
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:37,347
Again lies?! Song and Pocket!!

532
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,644
-You like to listen? - Hmm!

533
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,684
Really? Ok!

534
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:42,823
Then, sit here. Let me listen.

535
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:54,727
''O shining firefly,
who are you searching for, flashing light?''

536
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:58,330
''Will your father come near you?''

537
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:08,811
Team DrC

538
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:15,082
''Will your father come near you?''

539
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:21,929
''To caress your crown
and make you sleep singing stories''

540
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:26,092
''Will your father come near you?''

541
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:32,567
''First he applied the kohl of a new dream in
your eyes,''

542
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:37,670
''Gave tinkling bangles for your wings,''

543
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:42,952
''He smeared gold and honey
on your little lips and fed you,''

544
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,956
''And came with hands forward when you
toddled''

545
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:54,029
''O shining firefly,
who are you searching for, flashing light?''

546
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:59,562
''Will your father come near you?''

547
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:05,371
''Will your father come near you?''

548
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,660
Oh God, please move...please move.

549
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:39,205
''When your ears were pierced to wear diamond
earrings,''

550
00:44:39,743 --> 00:44:44,703
''Didn't he sing songs keeping you
on his shoulders to stop your sobbing?''

551
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:50,052
''With the ring given by a star''

552
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,020
''Won't you tell me the letter
which he wrote on your little tongue, O firefly''

553
00:44:56,527 --> 00:45:00,827
''Like my shadow, the whole day and night,''

554
00:45:01,165 --> 00:45:06,364
''When my legs faltered
didn't my father come to my aid?''

555
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:12,004
''lsn't he a stream of love, which never runs
dry''

556
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:17,876
''O shining firefly,
who are you searching for, flashing light?''

557
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,948
''Will your father come near you?''

558
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,936
''Didn't he dress you up in a new frock''

559
00:45:46,043 --> 00:45:49,843
''And keep bindi on your forehead?''

560
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:54,973
''Didn't he come with you till the steps of the
school?''

561
00:45:55,652 --> 00:46:00,680
''When you laugh,
isn't it august moonlight in yourfather's eyes?''

562
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:06,462
''When you are sad,
won't his heart throb without anyone seeing?''

563
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:16,666
''Though the girl grows up, isn't she
always a lotus grasshopper in his heart?''

564
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:22,605
''lsn't she a whimpering cute baby playing
mischief?''

565
00:46:23,313 --> 00:46:28,444
''O shining firefly,
who are you searching for, flashing light?''

566
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:33,453
''Will your father come near you?''

567
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:39,285
''First he applied the kohl of a new dream in
your eyes,''

568
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:44,635
''Gave tinkling bangles for your wings,''

569
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:49,538
''He smeared gold and honey
on your little lips and fed you,''

570
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:54,803
''And came with hands forward when you
toddled''

571
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:21,802
Very good!

572
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:24,764
Follow this

573
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,382
All board members will be present for the
programme.

574
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:35,876
Yourjob will become permanent, l've no doubt.

575
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,517
lt's really divine to impart our knowledge to
others.

576
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,523
When God gives some deformity,

577
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:45,727
He will also give some talents as a remedy.

578
00:47:46,263 --> 00:47:48,390
l've seen that in every children here.

579
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,396
As far as the blind people are concerned,

580
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:52,398
they think the entire world is like them!

581
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:55,669
ls your class fortoday over, Ramaettan?

582
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,808
Hmm! No duty today?

583
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,504
l'm transferred to Law and Order! Mustjoin
tomorrow.

584
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:02,371
l got into the kitchen early morning ,

585
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,604
and saw a few recipes of my mother
which my grandpa loves.

586
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,784
With all that l made a special lunch for him.

587
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:10,378
You must be really lucky
to get such a grand daughter.

588
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,551
Lucky?! l will give her 6 months time.

589
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,215
Asked her to say if she has got
someone in her mind.

590
00:48:16,426 --> 00:48:18,690
Or will get her married to whom l like!

591
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:22,390
Have you started, grandpa? l'm going.
Will come in the evening.

592
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,358
-Are you back home? - Yes.

593
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:26,761
Drop Jayaraman at home!

594
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:30,238
-Okay, sir! - Please come, Ramaetta!

595
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:37,475
Today, l will kill her also! Who will dare to ask
me?

596
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,309
Take off your hands from me!
Take off your hands l say.

597
00:48:39,716 --> 00:48:41,547
-Calm down, Abdu! -Abdu is your father!

598
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,720
-lf l give you a blow.. - Not Abdu, he is Madhu!

599
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,648
Let it be anything! Ask him not to create a
chaos!

600
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,657
-Decent people live here. - My foot!

601
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,228
She lodged a complaint against me to S.P

602
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,624
What will he do?

603
00:48:54,398 --> 00:48:55,490
What is the commotion here?

604
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,724
-This Rascal has come here also.
- Rascal is your paramour!

605
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:01,735
Don't dare touch her. Get away.

606
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:07,210
So, you are my wife's paramour now.

607
00:49:07,344 --> 00:49:09,574
She is your Ex-wife now, isn't it?
Didn't you elope with someone?

608
00:49:09,746 --> 00:49:10,644
Now how do you claim rights on her?

609
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,310
Who the hell are you to ask me?

610
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,314
You only said l'm your wife's paramour! Then
what?

611
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,521
-Hey you! - Don't make a scene, Mohideen!

612
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,318
Mohideen is your..!!

613
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,525
-Come here, man. - What the hell is his name?

614
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:22,492
Dulquer Salman!

615
00:49:22,726 --> 00:49:24,694
-Just leave me! - Madhu, don't make noise.

616
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:29,662
Settle it amongst yourself if there is any issue!
Why making it public?

617
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:30,692
Leave me!

618
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:38,437
Now l'm going!
Don't try to frighten me with Police and Army!

619
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:41,678
Your scoundrel brother and this blind man..

620
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,537
will surely fall into my clutches one day!
l'll take him to task then.

621
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,313
Hey! Remember!

622
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,548
Give way, Rascal!

623
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:54,952
Sir!

624
00:49:55,726 --> 00:49:58,251
What is the need to withdraw such a huge
amount now?

625
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,691
l put this money on Nandini's name in Fixed
deposit.

626
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,299
Let's not keep it here anymore.

627
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,992
Deposit this on her Ooty's account.

628
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,633
Why don't we transfer it to her account?

629
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,563
No! Some people are stealthily checking
my accounts nowadays!

630
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,669
Nobody should know to whose account
the money is transferred to!

631
00:50:20,717 --> 00:50:24,380
l promised herthat l will bring you this time.

632
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,384
You must come.

633
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,093
lt's risky to meet her this time.

634
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:33,719
He is following me like a shadow...That Vasu.

635
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,699
His aim is to find out Nandini.

636
00:50:38,735 --> 00:50:39,394
What for?

637
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:47,541
Hereafter l'm not going
to conceal anything from you.

638
00:50:49,312 --> 00:50:57,447
Team DrC

639
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,522
You couldn't believe my words, isn't it?

640
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:05,427
Those who were connected with Vasu's
punishment,

641
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,393
have died at many different places.

642
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:11,931
Perhaps, could be the vengeance
for devastating his family!

643
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:16,929
lnvestigated Officer, Post mortem Doctor,
Public Prosecutor Nambiar,

644
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,505
Suppose Vasu is behind all these murders..

645
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,414
Then, his next prey will be ME and NANDlNl!

646
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,917
Groom's people came home fixing the
marriage date of Lakhsmi.

647
00:51:33,123 --> 00:51:34,954
They insist on performing the marriage on 24th!

648
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:36,057
So soon?

649
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,394
Seems groom has no leave!

650
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:40,496
What happened to Baputty's matter?.

651
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:42,496
l couldn't reach him over phone!

652
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,557
No, he purposely averted your call!

653
00:51:45,001 --> 00:51:46,093
No chance! He is not of that sort.

654
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,161
Why don't you still understand people around
you?

655
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,870
Didn't Bapukutty come home 3 months ago
and returned without seeing you.

656
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,542
ln case he has any intention
of returning your money,

657
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:55,535
wouldn't he have met you?

658
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:57,173
l don't think you will get back that money

659
00:51:57,514 --> 00:51:58,879
l will surely get back!
You make the arrangements for marriage.

660
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:02,049
l will. But make sure you arrange
the money forthe expenses.

661
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,456
Take this.

662
00:52:11,094 --> 00:52:14,461
-What is this?
- Sardarji gave this for his daughter's marriage.

663
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,464
Gave dresses for all in attractive colours!

664
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,069
Please move, Ramaettan.

665
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,170
Hey, what happened?

666
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:23,163
Ameena's child suddenly suffers from
breathing difficulty!

667
00:52:26,576 --> 00:52:27,440
Hold that.

668
00:52:29,913 --> 00:52:30,538
Get inside quickly.

669
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:36,152
Hold the child. Move immediately.

670
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,015
Child was playing. All of a sudden it fainted.

671
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:42,182
Occasionally it happens.

672
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:43,856
lsn't the child's father at here?

673
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:48,028
He comes now and then. Seems he has
got some business in his hometown

674
00:52:48,565 --> 00:52:49,862
He works in Dubai!

675
00:52:51,568 --> 00:52:55,163
Sir, thank you for protecting my daughter's
honour.

676
00:52:55,605 --> 00:53:01,009
We host a function this evening.
Please attend and bless my daughter.

677
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,543
Definitely!

678
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:03,839
Thank you!

679
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:09,243
Full of sweets! You take it.

680
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:12,849
Sardarji has given handfuls for all the maids
here.

681
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,556
-l also got a Ghagra choli - Really?

682
00:53:16,593 --> 00:53:21,121
Call me once the entertainment gets over this
evening

683
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,123
Surely! Keep this safe.

684
00:53:46,957 --> 00:53:48,754
You look very handsome.

685
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,560
lf there is a turban also,
nobody will say that you are not a Sardarji.

686
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,698
You saw my dress?

687
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:56,731
How can l see?

688
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,162
Please touch and see.

689
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:02,661
Thinking l'm a Punjabi,
a Punjabi boy tried to flirt with me.

690
00:54:02,939 --> 00:54:04,770
When l spoke in Malayalam, he ran away.

691
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,539
Thank heavens! That boy escaped!

692
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,970
Shall l ask you something?
You should tell the truth.

693
00:54:14,684 --> 00:54:15,742
-So.. - So?

694
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:18,745
You like, don't you?

695
00:54:19,689 --> 00:54:20,747
Yeah, very much!

696
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,292
l knew it earlier.

697
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:29,529
But l need a spicy stew
with lots of green chillies.

698
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,334
Only then it will be delicious to taste!

699
00:54:31,334 --> 00:54:33,859
lt needs to be fermented with toddy and not
yeast!

700
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:38,300
l asked whether you like me or not
and not about rice cakes.

701
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:40,604
Why such a hesitation only to say that?

702
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,606
Enough of Cajoling!
Go and get some curry, you lass!

703
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:46,280
Hell with his Curry!!

704
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:53,646
lf don't like me, then why did you support me
when that rascal yelled at me?

705
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:56,155
Or else he would have kicked you to death!

706
00:54:56,359 --> 00:54:58,156
That's the reason people hesitate to help
nowadays.

707
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,152
-Shall l take a selfie? - Eh!

708
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,797
l don't need any KULFl!
lf l need, l shall take it.

709
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,827
Go and stand beside the girls!
Don't make others gossip!

710
00:55:07,337 --> 00:55:09,168
Are you here? We were searching you all over.

711
00:55:09,339 --> 00:55:10,704
Only if you search here, you can find me!

712
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,609
-How will l.. - Please take one photo!

713
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,902
Can't dress up more gorgeous than this ever!

714
00:55:18,214 --> 00:55:19,613
Hey, take off your hands and stand quietly.

715
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:21,844
Hello...turn straight..

716
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,145
-Stay quietly. - Don't come in between
while taking photograph!

717
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:27,585
Look here.

718
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:31,692
Stand without shaking.

719
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:33,857
Ready! Ok!

720
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:35,689
Let me see - See!

721
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:37,395
Splendid!

722
00:55:39,436 --> 00:55:40,801
She really looks very pretty!

723
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,269
Nobody will call her a maid.

724
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,137
Can't you marry her?
She will get a pair and you will get a company.

725
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,743
You've also become bad
with the company of Kunjakka.

726
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,237
Enjoy the feast and go home quickly.

727
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:51,675
You will not be destined to get such
a food all the day.

728
00:55:52,148 --> 00:55:55,285
Apart from Dosas,
isn't there any ghee rice or chicken biryani?

729
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:56,775
Chicken Biryani in Sardarji's marriage?

730
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:58,415
Won't there be chickens in Punjab?

731
00:55:58,788 --> 00:56:00,255
Lets check that with Singh, come.

732
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:01,720

-You saw only after someone

819
01:09:42,211 --> 01:09:43,473
So, it was him who saw it first, right?

01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,449
-So it was Jayaraman

What nonsense you are talking?
Where were you at the time of incident?

828
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:07,132
l was downstairs.

No! lt's me only!

01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,996
-Yes!
- Then, how did you know the person was dead?

838
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,099
When Jayaraman cried loud!

839
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:45,740
-So it was Jayaraman who
took you upstairs. - Yes.

840
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:51,143
-He only told you about such an incident, right?
- Yes

841
01:10:52,214 --> 01:10:55,240
-He only showed you the dead person, right?

Shall l give him a blow?

846
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,191
We got to be careful with him.

847
01:11:16,038 --> 01:11:19,872
He is trying to confuse us.

848
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,839

and asked Beeran and Rahman to inform Police.

852
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,979
-Beeran and Rahman! - Yes

853
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:34,984
-Did they inform us? - Yes!

854
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:37,090
- Where are they? - They are around.

855
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:38,784
Overthere!

856
01:11:39,728 --> 01:11:40,820
-Them? - Hmm!

857
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,993
Hey, you! Come here!

858
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:50,204
Who is Beeran?

859
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:54,334
-Can't you hear? Who is Beeran?
- l don't know sir.

860
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,705
-You, Rahman? - No, sir.

861
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:58,847
-Well , what is your name? - Raghavan!

862
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,842
-Raghavan?! And your name? - Veeran!

863
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:03,275
Veeran and Raghavan!!

864
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,979
-Were you the ones who called the Police?
- Yes, sir.

865
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:09,679
But this fool said it was Beeran and Rahman!
Where the hell they are?

866
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:11,018
There are no such persons with those names.

867
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:12,158
Whatever he says is a blatant lie, sir!

868
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:13,990
Put this liar in the Jeep.

869
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:15,185
l shall make him spill the beans.

870
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:16,965
Who is this Jayaraman?

871
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:18,029
Person standing overthere.

872
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:19,189
Hey, come here.

873
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:28,903
-Were you the one who took this fool
upstairs and showed the body first? - Yes, sir.

874
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:32,111
Then, why is he saying
that he saw the body first?

875
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:33,682
He is telling the truth only, sir.

876
01:12:34,216 --> 01:12:36,184
-What truth? - Kunjakka only saw it first.

877
01:12:38,721 --> 01:12:40,052
-You also.. - Please listen to what l say.

878
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:43,191
Answer only to my questions. Got it?

879
01:12:44,827 --> 01:12:48,888
-You only said that you took him upstairs to the
spot where the incident took place - Yes sir.

880
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,632
-Then, it's you who saw it first!
- No, sir. lt's Kunjakka.

881
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:59,903
Only after you took him to the spot,
this swine saw the body.

882
01:13:00,809 --> 01:13:02,106
That means you saw it first.

883
01:13:02,478 --> 01:13:03,103
No, sir! lt's Kunjakka only.

884
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,946
Are you kidding me, you swine!

885
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:06,910
How the hell he saw it when you didn't?

886
01:13:08,817 --> 01:13:09,442
Sir, l'm ANDAN(blind)!

887
01:13:09,818 --> 01:13:12,753
Just now you said you are Jayaraman,
and now NANDAN?

888
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,746
All are cheats! Put everybody in the jeep.

889
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:15,446
Sir...Please..l'm ANDAN(BLlND)

890
01:13:15,791 --> 01:13:17,918
l have no sight...Eye sight!

891
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:25,934
Really, sir! lt's totally dark! He has no sight!

892
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:32,030
When you have no sight,
then how did you see the incident first?

893
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:34,767
That is the reason l told you l saw it first.

894
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,968
Don't talk a word! l will give a blow on your
chest!

895
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,444
Couldn't you tell me
earlierthat he is blind, you Swine?

896
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:42,010
You only asked me to answer only to your
questions.

897
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:47,883
Put everyone in the jeep.

898
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:49,886
Will not disclose the truth if questioned politely.

899
01:14:10,913 --> 01:14:15,145
Many are hanging around
with Cameras to take away our lives!

900
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:17,783
Now they got some stuff
to munch for a couple of days.

901
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:19,454
l.G called up.

902
01:14:20,088 --> 01:14:21,715
He too has much pressure from his superior

903
01:14:22,491 --> 01:14:25,426
As the deceased was a retired Chief Justice,
if the case not resolved immediatey

904
01:14:26,762 --> 01:14:28,024
Then Judge will flay us in the Court.

905
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:29,726
How far is the examination?

906
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:32,167
Police dog ran up to the road and stopped
there.

907
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:32,895
Then, what happened?

908
01:14:33,101 --> 01:14:35,433
Passed urine and hung there for some time.

909
01:14:35,771 --> 01:14:39,867
As marriage function was going on,
nobody has any clear picture about the visitors

910
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:41,142
Post mortem report?

911
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:43,442
Overdose of lnsulin!

912
01:14:44,580 --> 01:14:46,548
Was the Judge, a diabetic?

913
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,974
Yes sir. He used to take insulin.

914
01:14:49,184 --> 01:14:51,015
But this was administered with force!

915
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:54,013
Besides, index finger
of the deceased's right hand was cut.

916
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:55,855
Cloth was stuffed in his mouth.

917
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,550
Was there any theft?

918
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:01,920
Almirah was lying open.
Watch and ring were all inside.

919
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:04,031
Not sure if anything else was lost!

920
01:15:04,433 --> 01:15:05,567
You checked his phone?

921
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:08,934
Yes sir! His last call
was to lift operatorJayaraman!

922
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,800
that too, 10 minutes before the incident!

923
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:12,836
ls the person here?

924
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,535
Yes sir! We detained almost
all the people from that flat.

925
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:17,502
Call him inside.

926
01:15:20,082 --> 01:15:21,913
Get up. Come!

927
01:15:25,587 --> 01:15:26,053
Straight!

928
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:28,920
Turn left!

929
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:33,357
Next day, keeping the Judge's body
...the killer was there.

930
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:35,490
That means killer also must be living there.

931
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:38,498
Rather bringing in a sniffer dog or Swine

932
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:42,361
Make Jayaraman sniff each and everybody in
the flat

933
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,904
ln case the killer is there,
he will sniff and surely find out.

934
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,369
Are you making fun of us?

935
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:47,372
l'm not joking.

936
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,168
He is right.

937
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:53,479
Definitely he will find out the
killer if he goes past him.

938
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:58,916
Without even asking, he got the sense to
judge whoever uses the lift daily.

939
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:03,915
Then?

940
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,460
By the time l reached down following the killer

941
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,926
l heard an Autorickshaw moving.

942
01:16:09,531 --> 01:16:12,056
Then l didn't know how he disappeared!
l guess he escaped in that!

943
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:15,331
-Trace that auto rickshaw - Ok sir.

944
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,639
No one else should know about this.

945
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,472
With a heavy heart, l'm doing this,

946
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:27,910
only because of your insistence.

947
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,083
Please think over.

948
01:16:31,019 --> 01:16:34,887
Then, later you shouldn't regret.

949
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:39,460
Just consider you are doing a favourto me.

950
01:16:39,995 --> 01:16:40,984
Let the cash be with you.

951
01:16:41,663 --> 01:16:42,630
When there is a need, l will let you know.

952
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:44,896
What about Nandini then?

953
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:47,026
School authorities will call only this number.

954
01:16:48,503 --> 01:16:50,471
Don't disclose anything to them.

955
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:52,037
See you!

956
01:16:52,474 --> 01:17:16,560
Team DrC

957
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,328
Hello Kanna!

958
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:23,436
Make arrangements for the marriage..

959
01:17:24,373 --> 01:17:26,603
..in a grand way.

960
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,667
Cash is ready.

961
01:17:30,012 --> 01:17:31,479
You don't have to bother about the source of
funds.

962
01:17:32,047 --> 01:17:36,006
Come on Saturday and collect the cash
from Pillaichettan's shop.

963
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:40,777
Move away.

964
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:44,251
Ramettan! lt's me, Ganga!

965
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:46,512
Someone...someone pushed me!

966
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:05,705
Nandini Krishnamoorthy! This child studied
here only.

967
01:19:06,308 --> 01:19:08,276
But took T.C and left the school last year.

968
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,642
Do you know which School she joined?

969
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:14,341
We got few suspicions about his death.

970
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:16,340
lt's a part of the police enquiry.

971
01:19:16,818 --> 01:19:18,649
l know. l read in papers.

972
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:22,250
But l don't know which School she joined.

973
01:19:22,724 --> 01:19:26,182
TC and Conduct Certificate was signed
and collected by one Mr.Jayaraman.

974
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:28,763
You may contact him for more details

975
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,459
He is the Child's local guardian.

976
01:19:34,803 --> 01:19:36,771
-You saw somebody pushing him? - No.

977
01:19:37,405 --> 01:19:39,373
Then, how do you that somebody pushed him?

978
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:40,599
Jayaraman told me.

979
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:45,337
Can't trust any of his words!
He only talks irrelevant!

980
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:47,242
A murderthat a person with eyes didn't see

981
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:48,781
How will a blind alone see?

982
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,218
Have you ever come across such a story?

983
01:19:51,386 --> 01:19:53,479
l doubt it's one of his trick!

984
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:57,316
if you turn a blind eye to it,
l will surely make him spill the beans!

985
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:01,189
Just shut up. Unless there is any valid proof,
we have no right to torture anybody.

986
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:02,690
..That too a blind man!

987
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:04,499
That's enough to ask for trouble!

988
01:20:04,699 --> 01:20:07,327
Then media and human rights commission
will...

989
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:08,594
peel out

990
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:10,602
-You saw this? - What's it, sir?.

991
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:12,040
Krishnamoorthy had withdrawn
this amount from the bank -

992
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:13,241
- in the morning on the day of his murder

993
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:14,208
Rs.50 lakhs!

994
01:20:14,376 --> 01:20:15,206
Where did that cash disappear?

995
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:16,344
Here is the bank statement.

996
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:20,743
Only when l went to transfer uncle's account
to mother's name , we learnt it.

997
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:23,479
Sir, found that autorickshaw driver.

998
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:24,275
Call him.

999
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:25,486
Come inside.

1000
01:20:28,223 --> 01:20:30,350
Oh, were you the one?

1001
01:20:31,393 --> 01:20:32,189
Don't you know him..

1002
01:20:32,727 --> 01:20:34,126
..Chain Babu..

1003
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:37,527
All that glitters on women's neck will be in his
grip!

1004
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:39,131
He is the Culprit.

1005
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:43,198
Will make him disclose about Rs.50 lakhs
if you give him a good treatment!

1006
01:20:43,338 --> 01:20:44,703
Do you know only this method?

1007
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:54,448
That was past sir. Now l'm a father of 2 girls.

1008
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:56,547
l make a decent living now.

1009
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,449
Still, will a monkey forget to jump?

1010
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,453
Why did you go to the flat that night?

1011
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:06,523
-From Hospital, with mother and child...
- Mother also??

1012
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:07,251
What are you saying?

1013
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:08,453
Came to drop mother and child from hospital.

1014
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:10,130
-Whose mother? - Child's mother.

1015
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:11,458
-Whose child? - Mother's child.

1016
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:12,257
Doesn't the child have a name?

1017
01:21:12,434 --> 01:21:13,264
You!!

1018
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:15,260
Then?

1019
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,262
When l was going back, one person got into the
auto.

1020
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:18,269
Who was that person?

1021
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:19,407
One person!

1022
01:21:19,741 --> 01:21:20,537
Doesn't he have a name?

1023
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:23,604
Can l ask names of all those,
who ride in my auto?

1024
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:25,606
What is wrong with asking? Leave it!

1025
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,278
How was he?

1026
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:29,412
Like everybody does, he also sat behind.

1027
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:32,950
No point of questioning him like this.

1028
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:35,518
l will take him to a side
and do a detailed investigation. Come!

1029
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:36,418
You!!

1030
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:39,591
Will you be able to
identify him if you see him again?

1031
01:21:39,995 --> 01:21:42,964
Yes sir! His forehead was injured and
blood was seeping out.

1032
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:45,592
Where did you drop him?

1033
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:47,525
He got down at the Lisie Junction!

1034
01:21:48,003 --> 01:21:49,664
-Didn't he pay you the fare? - He did!

1035
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:51,399
How much?

1036
01:21:52,307 --> 01:21:54,605
That's..one Rs.50 and two Rs.20

1037
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:55,669
Give me those notes.

1038
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:59,280
-l gave at home to buy fish. - Shucks!

1039
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:01,278
lf it was there,we could've found the Culprit
now.

1040
01:22:01,449 --> 01:22:01,938
How?

1041
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,619
With help of the fingerprints..

1042
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:05,942
You!!!

1043
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:08,486
Sir, shall l take leave? Thank you, sir.

1044
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:10,521
-Shall l also.. - Ok!

1045
01:22:10,692 --> 01:22:11,954
-ln which shop did you buy fish? - Hey you!

1046
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,627
Don't utter a word now on! l will question him.

1047
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,260
You enquired about that person in hospital.

1048
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:20,264
Yes, sir! No such person walked in there.

1049
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,498
Take his statement, his description,
and send him.

1050
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:25,699
-Get his mobile number also. - Okay.

1051
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,400
-Come! - Hey.

1052
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:29,701
You have to come whenever we call

1053
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:31,203
Sir!

1054
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:14,739
Moorthy sir's killer is here! Close the gate.
Don't let anybody out.

1055
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:16,610
Please inform the Police

1056
01:24:17,452 --> 01:24:18,817
He is inside one of the flats in the 11th floor.

1057
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:40,808
ls there anybody else inside otherthan you?

1058
01:24:41,443 --> 01:24:41,807
No.

1059
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:43,536
Only me and my daughter.

1060
01:24:43,845 --> 01:24:44,539
What happened?

1061
01:24:46,848 --> 01:24:47,872
Ask men inside your flat to come out.

1062
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:53,514
-Hubby...-What happened?

1063
01:24:53,822 --> 01:24:55,483
We are looking out for a person.

1064
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:03,723
That's our American Vijayan's flat. He has
locked it and gone. Nobody is inside this.

1065
01:25:04,566 --> 01:25:07,763
Kunjaka, you only said,
that you saw light during nights here.

1066
01:25:08,002 --> 01:25:09,765
-He is mad.-Mad is your mom.

1067
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:12,406
l really saw, Jayaraman.

1068
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:15,676
Nobody is in that flat!
l cleaned the flat and locked it only 2 days back.

1069
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,708
Where are the keys, Kunjaka?

1070
01:25:17,879 --> 01:25:19,437
-At office! -Bring it soon

1071
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:22,514
How can a killer enter into a flat
which is locked from outside?

1072
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:25,149
Kunjakka, get the keys

1073
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:30,521
Don't close the lift! l'm also coming

1074
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:34,151
Whom are you looking for?

1075
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:35,654
Nobody came here.

1076
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:49,401
Looks like it's locked from inside.

1077
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:52,140
Move aside.

1078
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:52,265
Move aside.

1079
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:36,577
Don't hit him. He is my younger brother!

1080
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:40,719
Move aside

1081
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,528
This was the cash Krishnamoorthy
had withdrawn from the bank.

1082
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:51,691
Bank's stamp is there on its wrapper.

1083
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,824
How did the cash come to his hands?

1084
01:27:54,235 --> 01:27:59,798
On the day he died, Moorthy Sir, on hearing my
woes, gave this money to me in the morning.

1085
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:00,833
What for?

1086
01:28:01,709 --> 01:28:05,611
When Police enquired him at his
work place in Bangalore,

1087
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:06,279
He lost thatjob.

1088
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:12,586
Fearing that he may be killed if he's caught
by the Police, l made him stay here secretly.

1089
01:28:13,721 --> 01:28:15,689
On the night when Moorthy sir died,

1090
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:21,692
l gave him the cash and asked him to go
somewhere and escape.

1091
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:26,666
Later, when this place was under police
observation he couldn't get away from here.

1092
01:28:28,202 --> 01:28:31,569
l swear on God, he hasn't killed anyone.

1093
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:36,610
Did you know that he kept
so much of cash with him?

1094
01:28:36,778 --> 01:28:40,305
Yes, l knew sir.

1095
01:28:40,648 --> 01:28:41,171
How?

1096
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:49,385
l saw Ramettan giving him the cash
and Moorthy Sir keeping it inside.

1097
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:50,783
Then, where did he keep the cash?

1098
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:53,752
On the shelf.

1099
01:28:56,097 --> 01:29:05,062
Team DrC

1100
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:08,208
Hey, move.

1101
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:17,783
Sir!

1102
01:29:23,257 --> 01:29:24,224
Do you suspect him?

1103
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,330
Sir..Not him, sir.

1104
01:29:30,331 --> 01:29:32,026
How do you say this so strongly?

1105
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:34,733
The kind of situation here makes me tell this...

1106
01:29:35,236 --> 01:29:37,761
There is some secret affair
between Jayaraman and Devayani

1107
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:39,437
-Everyone in the flat knows that.
-Yeah, you are right.

1108
01:29:40,074 --> 01:29:41,041
That is the truth.

1109
01:29:41,309 --> 01:29:42,367
He is only the Killer!

1110
01:29:43,077 --> 01:29:44,442
Three of them planned and killed.

1111
01:29:44,812 --> 01:29:47,781
And to save his skin, he is fabricating a killer.

1112
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:50,217
There is no such person!!

1113
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:51,383
Not a fabricated person, Sir!

1114
01:29:51,753 --> 01:29:54,017
lf you've finished your coffee,
please listen to me carefully.

1115
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:01,460
He has a good physique,
wearing pant and shirt.

1116
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:04,696
Slim and more than 6 feet tall.

1117
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:07,331
Did you measure him with a tape?

1118
01:30:08,469 --> 01:30:09,299
No sir!

1119
01:30:10,037 --> 01:30:12,005
Comparing my height,

1120
01:30:12,206 --> 01:30:17,337
l can judge the height of the person
who is against me or talking before me.

1121
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:21,044
You are approximately 6 feet tall, am l right, sir?

1122
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:23,278
Finished talking

1123
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:27,287
He is approximately 70 - 72 kgs.

1124
01:30:28,189 --> 01:30:29,281
Comparing my weight,

1125
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:35,054
l can guess the weight, if l lift up something
or anything that falls on me,

1126
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:37,160
Not only that, he is a left-hander.

1127
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:38,298
How do you know that?

1128
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:40,694
He wore his watch on the right hand.

1129
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:43,294
Normally only left-handers will do that.

1130
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,131
Here he is

1131
01:30:45,339 --> 01:30:48,137
Sir it's pretty clear that he is
trying to hide truth.

1132
01:30:48,342 --> 01:30:52,005
ln his earlier statement he told the
killer fled away in an auto.

1133
01:30:52,180 --> 01:30:56,048
The statement of the auto driver and that of
Jayaraman is absolutely inconsistent.

1134
01:30:56,317 --> 01:30:59,013
lt seems somebody is attempting
to kill the judge

1135
01:30:59,187 --> 01:31:01,155
And he was in search of him! Says some
nonsense!

1136
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:04,289
lf we trust his words, then we'll be nowhere

1137
01:31:11,265 --> 01:31:16,134
Jayarama, you went with him to withdraw
money from the bank, right?

1138
01:31:16,337 --> 01:31:16,996
Yes sir.

1139
01:31:18,206 --> 01:31:20,003
How much?

1140
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:21,432
Rs 50 lakhs!

1141
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:26,141
When there was a scuffle
between you and the killer,

1142
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:28,311
Did he carry any bag or box?

1143
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,218
No, sir.

1144
01:31:32,019 --> 01:31:35,352
Killer can't get away with such a huge amount
in his pocket, can he?

1145
01:31:36,424 --> 01:31:37,516
Then, who took away that cash?

1146
01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:39,226
Sir, that is..

1147
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:41,189
He's struggling for words...he is lying sir

1148
01:31:42,196 --> 01:31:43,128
l don't know sir

1149
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:45,026
Why did he take such a big amount from the
bank?

1150
01:31:45,366 --> 01:31:46,196
Sir, that is..

1151
01:31:46,467 --> 01:31:48,298
Come on roll...Roll down from here.

1152
01:31:49,971 --> 01:31:52,030
He said that it was to give to his daughter.

1153
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:53,207
Where is his daughter now?

1154
01:31:57,979 --> 01:31:59,207
Now, have you become deaf also?

1155
01:31:59,413 --> 01:32:00,209
Where is his daughter?

1156
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:04,215
Sir, l would like to know who
all are here in this room.

1157
01:32:04,352 --> 01:32:05,876
Your mother and your mother's husband!!

1158
01:32:06,087 --> 01:32:06,485
Answer to the question.

1159
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:13,325
Sir, l don't know. l've only heard
that he has got a daughter.

1160
01:32:16,697 --> 01:32:19,100
Didn't you sign and collect the TC from -

1161
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,466
- Marthoma School,
2 yrs ago as her local guardian?

1162
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:22,025
He knows the truth, sir.

1163
01:32:23,371 --> 01:32:26,135
Who told you this, sir?.

1164
01:32:26,340 --> 01:32:28,035
Do you think we are fools!

1165
01:32:28,242 --> 01:32:29,334
-Sir, l understood one thing.-You come

1166
01:32:49,096 --> 01:33:08,438
Team DrC

1167
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:10,146
Hey, come here.

1168
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:11,407
Send everybody out.

1169
01:33:12,186 --> 01:33:15,314
Was it him who got into your auto that day?

1170
01:33:17,925 --> 01:33:18,323
No sir.

1171
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:20,325
ls it him?

1172
01:33:21,929 --> 01:33:24,056
No sir. l know Ramettan well.

1173
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,326
That can be anyone

1174
01:33:28,069 --> 01:33:29,434
Can be any one who attended that marriage
function!

1175
01:33:31,305 --> 01:33:32,363
May be!

1176
01:33:32,506 --> 01:33:35,031
Then, did the killer he said vanish into thin air?

1177
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:49,051
l have a great idea. You go, l will handle it.

1178
01:33:51,058 --> 01:33:52,025
All of you can leave now.

1179
01:33:52,193 --> 01:33:53,057
Must come when l call!

1180
01:33:53,227 --> 01:33:54,057
Get going.

1181
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,164
Jayaraman wait. l got something to tell you.

1182
01:33:59,266 --> 01:33:59,994
Send her.

1183
01:34:02,703 --> 01:34:03,362
Put him inside.

1184
01:34:06,707 --> 01:34:07,366
You dog!

1185
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:17,308
What's happening here, Kanna?

1186
01:34:17,518 --> 01:34:19,383
lt seems brother stole someone's cash in the
flat.

1187
01:34:20,054 --> 01:34:22,420
Oh my God! Wedding is going to be held here.

1188
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:27,160
Sir, he is not opening his mouth.

1189
01:34:28,262 --> 01:34:29,194
Tell me, dog!

1190
01:34:33,701 --> 01:34:38,070
l'll bury you here itself. Do you understand?

1191
01:34:38,706 --> 01:34:39,195
Bring it

1192
01:34:41,008 --> 01:34:43,067
That's mine! Brother didn't hide anything here.

1193
01:34:43,711 --> 01:34:45,076
How did this much gold come here?

1194
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:47,237
lt came from Muvattupuzha by bus.

1195
01:34:47,715 --> 01:34:50,377
This family's plight isn't that
bad to survive with theft money!

1196
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:53,144
Your family status will be known to public
shortly.

1197
01:34:54,255 --> 01:34:55,222
Get up, you swine

1198
01:34:58,059 --> 01:34:58,423
Move.

1199
01:35:30,658 --> 01:35:32,649
Grandpa! Court freed Ramettan

1200
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:34,754
Judge said he can't be kept in remand.

1201
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:37,256
Nabbing anybody if they couldn't nab the real
culprit!

1202
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:42,599
That C.l got punishment for harassing
this poor man unnecessarily!

1203
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:46,172
He has to stand before the Court Verandah
till 5 p.m without moving anywhere.

1204
01:35:47,108 --> 01:35:49,099
So he will not trouble you hereafter.

1205
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:53,769
Jayaraman, your uncle is waiting outside.
He wants to see you.

1206
01:35:57,218 --> 01:35:58,344
Best......

1207
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:08,057
Why did you come here?

1208
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:12,028
Only 2 more days left for marriage.
Plenty of work to do.

1209
01:36:12,233 --> 01:36:13,791
Lakshmi wanted to see you.

1210
01:36:14,235 --> 01:36:15,759
Won't l come there?

1211
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:18,194
Don't feel offended if l say this!

1212
01:36:18,672 --> 01:36:21,766
Villagers are talking ill of you.

1213
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:23,337
Groom's father had called up.

1214
01:36:23,811 --> 01:36:25,073
l guess they also learnt about it.

1215
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:28,841
So they want to perform the marriage at
Thalasery.

1216
01:36:36,190 --> 01:36:39,819
But we fixed it to be performed in ourtemple,
right?

1217
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:42,595
lt seems if marriage is held here,

1218
01:36:42,797 --> 01:36:48,258
their relatives will come to know this
and it will bring shame to their family.

1219
01:36:48,803 --> 01:36:50,270
That's why they took such a decision.

1220
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:55,073
Marriage is our first priority! So l also agreed.

1221
01:36:56,877 --> 01:36:59,141
-Lakshmi...-She is here.

1222
01:36:59,814 --> 01:37:00,678
Come here, dear.

1223
01:37:06,220 --> 01:37:09,621
-Why did you bring her here?
-l only insisted to meet you

1224
01:37:13,227 --> 01:37:15,855
l'm innocent, dear.

1225
01:37:17,731 --> 01:37:23,863
lt may be true, but can we
shut the villagers mouth?

1226
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,903
Brother, do you wish to stop this marriage?

1227
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:35,178
Avoiding me...?!

1228
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:43,212
Please bless me!

1229
01:37:50,164 --> 01:37:51,131
They left!

1230
01:38:31,972 --> 01:38:33,540
They didn't tell what the matter was!

1231
01:38:33,540 --> 01:38:34,939
Said they're calling from Nandini's school!

1232
01:38:35,309 --> 01:38:37,504
They asked you to give them a call.

1233
01:38:38,712 --> 01:38:40,475
Was it Alphonsa teacher who called up?

1234
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:42,206
No, it was a man's voice.

1235
01:38:44,718 --> 01:38:45,878
No chance of anyone calling up

1236
01:38:46,520 --> 01:38:47,646
You better call and see.

1237
01:38:47,855 --> 01:38:51,484
Only school authorities know this number,
right?

1238
01:38:56,664 --> 01:38:59,633
Who all are in this shop now?

1239
01:39:00,534 --> 01:39:02,934
Only Elsamma who is working in Post office!
You make a call.

1240
01:39:22,923 --> 01:39:26,620
That's..there is no range in
that teacher's mobile.

1241
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:29,953
Seems she doesn't know who called from
school.

1242
01:39:32,866 --> 01:39:34,891
lf you receive a call again, ask the name of the
caller.

1243
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:50,407
Talk loudly! Hello..Hello.

1244
01:39:51,518 --> 01:39:52,485
Give me a Pears and Gillette!

1245
01:39:57,758 --> 01:39:59,988
Shucks! What a mess!
Bro, shall l make a call.

1246
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:26,783
That money lender has come with lock and key

1247
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:29,820
Now bride has to go from shop's verandah to
marriage canopy

1248
01:40:34,862 --> 01:40:36,420
Unable to bear the shame we have to
coverthe faces in public

1249
01:40:37,831 --> 01:40:39,628
You still have enough stolen money with you,
right?

1250
01:40:39,767 --> 01:40:40,995
Repay the debt and get back the deed!.

1251
01:40:42,436 --> 01:40:43,733
l know where it is now!

1252
01:40:44,438 --> 01:40:48,704
Wasn't that money you entrusted Pillaichettan
to handover to me for marriage expenses?

1253
01:40:49,843 --> 01:40:51,811
Had l opened my mouth that day,
you would've been behind bars.

1254
01:40:52,446 --> 01:40:54,937
l thought not to hinder her marriage, l kept
mum.

1255
01:40:58,452 --> 01:41:01,910
l asked that money lenderto sell the house
and handover if any amount is left.

1256
01:41:02,456 --> 01:41:05,425
And if you come asking for any share from that

1257
01:41:05,626 --> 01:41:06,752
l won't even consider you as brother.

1258
01:41:10,697 --> 01:41:12,392
Was he telling the truth?

1259
01:41:15,702 --> 01:41:16,600
No, Kunjakka.

1260
01:41:17,438 --> 01:41:19,406
Then, how did you get money for the marriage?

1261
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:25,801
l sold my shop to Pillaichettan. lt's that cash.

1262
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:32,944
Wasn't that your only earning?

1263
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:38,383
Still Bapukutty cheated you!

1264
01:41:40,060 --> 01:42:01,211
Team DrC

1265
01:42:03,784 --> 01:42:06,753
''l am sitting with sharpness''

1266
01:42:07,421 --> 01:42:11,653
''Ready to cut off the black fingers pointing at
me''

1267
01:42:12,426 --> 01:42:16,157
''l brought up within me this dark serpent
Takshaka''

1268
01:42:17,197 --> 01:42:20,655
''Death, ready to collapse, is near''

1269
01:42:21,201 --> 01:42:25,467
''For the pure soul to rise up free from
impurity,''

1270
01:42:26,206 --> 01:42:30,165
''Limbless one, your strong fort
will be thoroughly devastated''

1271
01:42:34,748 --> 01:42:36,716
Vasu!

1272
01:42:38,752 --> 01:42:39,912
Smart

1273
01:42:40,554 --> 01:42:41,953
So you recognized me?

1274
01:42:42,689 --> 01:42:44,418
Only your eyes are blind!

1275
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:48,558
l know your intelligence,
knowledge or strength is not affected.

1276
01:42:48,762 --> 01:42:51,731
l'm at your hand's distance before your pitch
darkness

1277
01:42:52,566 --> 01:42:55,694
l'm in your breathe, shadow and the sound you
hear

1278
01:42:56,503 --> 01:43:00,837
But your eyes need at least a light of a firefly to
see me.

1279
01:43:01,775 --> 01:43:04,175
ln that darkness, there is a person you have
concealed.

1280
01:43:05,212 --> 01:43:05,871
NANDlNl.

1281
01:43:08,215 --> 01:43:11,241
After finding her and confining her in the death
trap

1282
01:43:11,752 --> 01:43:13,447
l'll vanish away.

1283
01:43:14,755 --> 01:43:15,744
You will never get her, Vasu.

1284
01:43:18,759 --> 01:43:19,726
You are wrong

1285
01:43:20,627 --> 01:43:22,527
l know where she is now.

1286
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:24,094
l'm going there.

1287
01:43:24,698 --> 01:43:26,723
l will reach there before you try to rescue her

1288
01:43:27,501 --> 01:43:30,732
You plan to follow and find out after frightening
me

1289
01:43:31,171 --> 01:43:33,662
No..You will never ever find her.

1290
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:42,545
Until you hold her frozen dead body,
May your hopes protect you!

1291
01:43:43,617 --> 01:43:44,584
Listen to me, Vasu!

1292
01:43:50,757 --> 01:43:53,726
This is Dubai number!
lt's used for lnternational roaming.

1293
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:57,895
But not so easy to track like local numbers.

1294
01:44:11,712 --> 01:44:15,739
Ganga, Keep an eye whether anybody
is following or watching me closely.

1295
01:44:15,949 --> 01:44:17,974
You get down, Rametta. l will do.

1296
01:44:29,162 --> 01:44:30,254
Are there many customers in the shop?

1297
01:44:31,131 --> 01:44:32,291
Only a few

1298
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:34,733
Let me know when they leave.
l need to make a call..

1299
01:44:34,901 --> 01:44:36,129
An urgent call!

1300
01:44:42,976 --> 01:44:43,965
Jayaraman, You can call now.

1301
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:47,775
Here is the Coin.

1302
01:45:07,067 --> 01:45:08,193
No, l will call you

1303
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:40,867
Bro, l forgot my phone somewhere here.

1304
01:45:41,835 --> 01:45:43,166
lt was in my hand while coming here.

1305
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:45,038
Got it!

1306
01:46:50,804 --> 01:46:51,429
St.Paul Church is close to it, isn't it?

1307
01:46:52,472 --> 01:46:54,940
You wait in front of the Church!
l will come there immediately.

1308
01:47:11,024 --> 01:47:12,457
Any auto waiting in front of the Church?

1309
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:14,427
Then, drop me beside it.

1310
01:47:20,801 --> 01:47:21,768
Rametta! l am here.

1311
01:47:26,973 --> 01:47:28,804
Are you sure it is him?

1312
01:47:29,009 --> 01:47:30,442
l couldn't reach Ganga madam over phone.

1313
01:47:30,811 --> 01:47:31,505
That's why l called you.

1314
01:47:32,045 --> 01:47:33,876
You told me to inform if l saw him again

1315
01:47:34,548 --> 01:47:37,108
And l'm also not sure if he
is the same person you are looking for.

1316
01:47:37,751 --> 01:47:40,845
But l'm sure it's him who got into
auto that night from the flat.

1317
01:47:49,763 --> 01:47:50,388
Which place is this?

1318
01:47:50,931 --> 01:47:52,762
lt's an old school run by the Church.

1319
01:47:52,933 --> 01:47:54,833
Now it's being renovated in a big way.

1320
01:48:15,822 --> 01:48:19,053
Babu, do one thing. l'll wait here.

1321
01:48:20,060 --> 01:48:22,460
You go inside. And if you see him,
bring him outside

1322
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:26,356
From his voice, l can make out
if he is the one l'm looking for!

1323
01:48:26,967 --> 01:48:29,561
lf he is the one, then he must never escape!

1324
01:48:29,936 --> 01:48:30,334
Go!

1325
01:48:33,607 --> 01:48:35,837
Babu, be careful!

1326
01:49:09,643 --> 01:49:11,941
l've brought the person. He is waiting outside.

1327
01:49:12,646 --> 01:49:16,309
You guys deal! Give my share and send me.

1328
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:17,609
l will settle it now.

1329
01:49:17,984 --> 01:49:19,281
Before that, you will have to do one more job.

1330
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,286
Dial 100 and inform Police that l'm here now.

1331
01:49:22,489 --> 01:49:22,887
WHAT?

1332
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:24,616
Just do whatever l tell you.

1333
01:49:25,358 --> 01:49:27,053
lnform Police that Judge's killer is here.

1334
01:49:29,362 --> 01:49:33,924
After coming out from Jail, l'm leading a
decent life without doing any crimes.

1335
01:49:35,502 --> 01:49:38,630
Although l'm a father of 2 girls and live in
poverty,

1336
01:49:38,972 --> 01:49:39,996
l live peacefully now.

1337
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:43,910
Only because l needed money urgently,
l agreed to this!

1338
01:49:44,945 --> 01:49:46,412
Please don't put me in a trap.

1339
01:49:51,918 --> 01:49:53,909
Do this also and take your share
and quit the place.

1340
01:50:04,331 --> 01:50:06,629
l'm Autodriver Babu from Pallimukku!

1341
01:50:07,500 --> 01:50:11,300
Judge's killer is at St.Paul school Fort Kochi

1342
01:50:15,308 --> 01:50:16,275
Here is your share.

1343
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:42,591
Sir...Sir..that Killer saw me
Sir, please come quickly

1344
01:50:43,703 --> 01:50:45,000
He is attempting to kill me.

1345
01:50:45,605 --> 01:50:46,594
Sir...please sir.

1346
01:50:48,274 --> 01:50:51,209
Hey!

1347
01:53:22,195 --> 01:53:23,594
Sir, Autodriver is dead.

1348
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,196
l couldn't record his statement.

1349
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:28,690
And Jayaraman? What did he say?

1350
01:53:29,502 --> 01:53:30,366
Admitted the Crime?

1351
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:32,505
He is fooling us again.

1352
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,508
He says, Autodriver called him

1353
01:53:35,708 --> 01:53:37,676
And he went there...

1354
01:53:38,545 --> 01:53:40,274
On the way he tried to contact Police

1355
01:53:40,513 --> 01:53:41,480
And it was unreachable.

1356
01:53:42,148 --> 01:53:45,174
Now, we got plenty of evidence against him.

1357
01:53:45,385 --> 01:53:46,682
We have not disclosed about the incident!

1358
01:53:47,153 --> 01:53:48,643
Until we get a clear picture..

1359
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:51,123
Yes, that is why l say, he must admit the crime.

1360
01:53:51,658 --> 01:53:53,250
He is behind everything!

1361
01:53:54,160 --> 01:53:55,218
Sir, you don't worry.

1362
01:53:55,528 --> 01:53:58,361
We will only get into trouble.

1363
01:53:58,565 --> 01:54:00,396
Now, we have lots of evidences against him

1364
01:54:00,567 --> 01:54:02,467
Let that mortuary Madhu also come.

1365
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:04,364
l will make him admit the truth.

1366
01:54:04,571 --> 01:54:07,096
Think and do! Otherwise, you will be screwed!

1367
01:54:07,340 --> 01:54:10,207
This time judge will make you
to stand on the roof top

1368
01:54:10,410 --> 01:54:13,607
He will not admit the truth
if we give him a feast

1369
01:54:14,414 --> 01:54:15,438
He is born in fire

1370
01:54:15,715 --> 01:54:17,546
l will produce you the evidences for all.

1371
01:54:27,961 --> 01:54:29,929
-Madhu!-Where is he?

1372
01:54:30,296 --> 01:54:31,194
He is in the Kitchen.

1373
01:54:31,965 --> 01:54:34,934
Commissioner wants him to admit the truth by
dawn.

1374
01:54:35,401 --> 01:54:37,926
Only then we can disclose about his arrest.Got
it?

1375
01:54:40,974 --> 01:54:41,941
Come!

1376
01:54:49,983 --> 01:54:50,415
Oh him!!

1377
01:54:52,518 --> 01:54:53,507
Do you already know him?

1378
01:54:53,953 --> 01:54:55,386
Yes!

1379
01:54:55,521 --> 01:54:57,614
Haven't you heard this Sir, One that you
searched will be found at your feet.

1380
01:54:58,424 --> 01:55:01,188
l've been waiting for long to get him in my
hands

1381
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:02,255
Sir, you get going!

1382
01:55:02,962 --> 01:55:08,229
l can also make him admit that
he killed his father and mother.

1383
01:55:08,534 --> 01:55:09,432
Madhu?!

1384
01:55:09,602 --> 01:55:10,967
No! Your Yama!

1385
01:55:11,971 --> 01:55:14,439
Last time you escaped.

1386
01:55:14,974 --> 01:55:17,272
This time, no chance!

1387
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:19,278
Lift up this rascal.

1388
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,606
His neck was slit.

1389
01:55:22,482 --> 01:55:24,609
We have the booty as sword-stick, knife etc

1390
01:55:26,953 --> 01:55:28,215
Why did you bring her here?

1391
01:55:28,955 --> 01:55:30,923
No Sir....it's for a proof

1392
01:55:31,391 --> 01:55:32,949
At midnight?

1393
01:55:33,426 --> 01:55:35,291
Take her to the 2nd room. l will come there.

1394
01:55:39,165 --> 01:56:03,786
Team DrC

1395
01:56:07,927 --> 01:56:09,895
You only have him as your own.

1396
01:56:10,296 --> 01:56:12,389
lf he hangs himself to death tomorrow,

1397
01:56:12,565 --> 01:56:13,532
Who else do you have then?

1398
01:56:15,935 --> 01:56:17,368
He will not take such a drastic step.

1399
01:56:18,371 --> 01:56:19,838
We are innocents!

1400
01:56:23,009 --> 01:56:24,533
She is not able to understand anything.

1401
01:56:25,078 --> 01:56:26,875
Make her understand. Or let her suffer.

1402
01:56:27,413 --> 01:56:27,970
See this...

1403
01:56:31,884 --> 01:56:35,320
When your brother was freed from the custody
today,

1404
01:56:35,555 --> 01:56:39,286
We got it in writing from him
that he has been freed without charge.

1405
01:56:39,459 --> 01:56:40,517
There are witnesses too!

1406
01:56:41,060 --> 01:56:44,860
lf he dies anywhere, Police
will not hold any responsibility.

1407
01:56:45,331 --> 01:56:49,563
Even if we hang him to death on a tree,

1408
01:56:50,336 --> 01:56:53,328
lt will only be considered as a Suicide.

1409
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:57,002
So, please take a decision quickly.

1410
01:56:57,443 --> 01:57:00,071
Who is important
- your brother or that blind man?

1411
01:57:02,415 --> 01:57:05,407
You have no other option than signing it.

1412
01:57:12,425 --> 01:57:14,416
Make him run one or two rounds.

1413
01:57:14,594 --> 01:57:16,391
Or bruises will turn into blue when a blood clot!

1414
01:57:21,434 --> 01:57:22,332
Are you resting?

1415
01:57:23,870 --> 01:57:24,336
Run!

1416
01:57:24,871 --> 01:57:25,394
Run there..

1417
01:57:43,856 --> 01:57:44,948
l will come home late. You sleep.

1418
01:57:45,124 --> 01:57:46,091
Will reach home only at dawn.

1419
01:57:48,127 --> 01:57:49,116
Would l get anything to eat?

1420
01:57:49,996 --> 01:57:51,827
At this hour?
ls pizza enough?

1421
01:57:51,998 --> 01:57:53,090
Any rubbish! Go and get it.

1422
01:57:53,433 --> 01:57:54,058
Take it.

1423
01:58:10,983 --> 01:58:12,507
Nobody knows about your arrest.

1424
01:58:13,986 --> 01:58:16,853
Tomorrow papers will flash
that you fled away killing the driver.

1425
01:58:18,157 --> 01:58:20,421
Until you admit , you will be here.

1426
01:58:22,128 --> 01:58:24,096
As you are blind, even if you fall into the well

1427
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:26,796
Or hit by the train and die also, no one will care.

1428
01:58:28,835 --> 01:58:30,996
So better give a written statement.

1429
01:58:32,004 --> 01:58:33,062
What do you say?

1430
01:58:34,006 --> 01:58:35,132
Open your mouth, you dog!

1431
01:58:39,178 --> 01:58:40,110
Give him some water!

1432
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:42,042
Ask him if he wants food.

1433
01:58:42,181 --> 01:58:44,046
Leave him for sometime! Let him take a gasp!

1434
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:54,453
Hello! l'm on duty now. Which Cinema?

1435
01:59:05,204 --> 01:59:05,966
Oh my God!

1436
01:59:19,018 --> 01:59:21,851
These people will surely kill me, sister!

1437
01:59:38,804 --> 01:59:42,467
Jayaraman, forget about Krishnamoorthy sir's
murder!

1438
01:59:42,608 --> 01:59:43,734
let's think that you have not killed him.

1439
01:59:44,544 --> 01:59:47,672
But in driver's murder case, you
will definitely be punished.

1440
01:59:47,880 --> 01:59:49,745
l got plenty of evidences against you.

1441
01:59:51,217 --> 01:59:54,243
Whether you killed one, two or even three

1442
01:59:54,587 --> 01:59:55,747
there will not be a big difference in the
punishment!

1443
01:59:57,223 --> 02:00:01,887
By troubling us like this,
is there any gain for you? No!

1444
02:00:02,595 --> 02:00:06,656
Therefore, admit to all these crimes.

1445
02:00:07,567 --> 02:00:10,730
Why unnecessarily get beaten up?!

1446
02:00:13,239 --> 02:00:14,672
l didn't kill anyone.

1447
02:00:15,608 --> 02:00:17,576
Didn't l say he will not admit?

1448
02:00:17,877 --> 02:00:19,572
So l will get it done right away.

1449
02:00:19,779 --> 02:00:21,144
This is artist Pappu's dialogue

1450
02:00:22,181 --> 02:00:23,170
You are not the only witness.

1451
02:00:23,616 --> 02:00:26,551
We got an eye witness,
who saw you killing Krishnamoorthy!

1452
02:00:27,186 --> 02:00:29,677
lt's a blatant lie. There is no such witness.

1453
02:00:30,189 --> 02:00:32,555
-lf so, bring them! - Go and get her.

1454
02:00:35,695 --> 02:00:36,662
What is all this?

1455
02:00:37,196 --> 02:00:39,255
No sir! He is really a fraud!

1456
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:43,894
Sir, this case is closed. Please read this.

1457
02:00:53,779 --> 02:00:54,302
Sit down.

1458
02:01:00,620 --> 02:01:02,520
Whatever you've written
in this statement is true?

1459
02:01:03,155 --> 02:01:03,678
Yes

1460
02:01:04,757 --> 02:01:08,591
Jayarman killed Krishnamoorthy for money,
right?

1461
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:12,689
Say it aloud! Let everybody hear

1462
02:01:15,167 --> 02:01:15,690
Yes!

1463
02:01:18,571 --> 02:01:21,768
-And you witnessed it? - Yes!

1464
02:01:23,175 --> 02:01:25,735
And to conceal it,
he offered you money, didn't he?

1465
02:01:28,180 --> 02:01:30,774
-Yes or No? - Yes!

1466
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:32,114
Deva...

1467
02:01:36,155 --> 02:01:37,179
lt's not true.

1468
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:40,284
As if you are the only truth-teller,
and the rest are liars!

1469
02:01:41,160 --> 02:01:42,184
lsn't she your lover?.

1470
02:01:42,595 --> 02:01:45,564
You should've realized when
you gave sweet promises and dumped her?

1471
02:01:47,166 --> 02:01:48,258
No family matters

1472
02:01:49,168 --> 02:01:50,135
Sign this.

1473
02:01:51,203 --> 02:02:17,929
Team DrC

1474
02:02:22,735 --> 02:02:24,100
Sir, please give me one more chance.

1475
02:02:24,737 --> 02:02:26,796
May be l can find out the real killer.

1476
02:02:27,306 --> 02:02:28,136
Sit down l say.

1477
02:02:29,442 --> 02:02:31,342
Trying to fool us?!

1478
02:02:32,244 --> 02:02:33,211
Stop bullshiting!

1479
02:02:33,446 --> 02:02:37,610
You are creating a fake killer in your
imagination,

1480
02:02:38,117 --> 02:02:39,414
To mislead the police investigation

1481
02:02:40,119 --> 02:02:42,781
Only that auto driver was against your
fabricated tales.

1482
02:02:43,289 --> 02:02:44,415
So you finished him too

1483
02:02:45,424 --> 02:02:47,392
No sir. Please trust me!

1484
02:02:47,727 --> 02:02:49,388
l got many reasons for not trusting you!

1485
02:02:49,729 --> 02:02:52,698
You only said that the Killer
is very strong and intelligent!

1486
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:57,431
Then why did the killer spare a blind and feeble
person like you on many occasions?

1487
02:02:58,304 --> 02:02:59,293
He is really an intelligent person!

1488
02:03:00,139 --> 02:03:03,404
So, he very well knows that it is not that easy!

1489
02:03:03,743 --> 02:03:04,402
Why?

1490
02:03:05,478 --> 02:03:07,173
He can't overpower me

1491
02:03:07,747 --> 02:03:11,080
Not only him, it's not possible for
anyone who challenges me directly.

1492
02:03:11,484 --> 02:03:12,746
Are you a superman?

1493
02:03:13,252 --> 02:03:14,742
See, this blind man's haughtiness!

1494
02:03:16,355 --> 02:03:19,051
Sir, you please go home. We'll handle this.

1495
02:03:25,097 --> 02:03:26,758
We'll bring him to the Commissioner office in
the morning.

1496
02:03:27,266 --> 02:03:29,257
He will admit the crimes. Go home, hopefully.

1497
02:03:32,471 --> 02:03:33,768
First drop her home.

1498
02:03:43,315 --> 02:03:45,283
Sir, please give me a last and final chance.

1499
02:03:46,185 --> 02:03:49,018
Sir, l know where the killer is now.

1500
02:03:50,456 --> 02:03:53,118
Stop otherwise l will kill you.

1501
02:03:53,459 --> 02:03:55,393
Don't hit me anymore..please.

1502
02:03:57,062 --> 02:03:58,393
Hey, lock the door.

1503
02:03:59,331 --> 02:04:00,127
Don't!

1504
02:04:01,066 --> 02:04:04,729
No matter however much you raise your voice,
it won't be heard outside.

1505
02:04:05,204 --> 02:04:06,432
That's why we made the set-up like this.

1506
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:13,005
lt was not for that reason
l stopped you from locking.

1507
02:04:13,479 --> 02:04:14,138
Then?

1508
02:04:16,482 --> 02:04:20,009
lt will be impossible even if you wish to escape!

1509
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,182
Hit him.

1510
02:04:26,025 --> 02:04:26,457
Thrash him to pulp.

1511
02:06:37,289 --> 02:06:40,019
Keep yourfeet in the warm water
for some more time.

1512
02:06:40,225 --> 02:06:43,194
lf you sleep for some time,
your tiredness and pain will go!

1513
02:06:43,362 --> 02:06:46,229
Pizza shop will open only at 10.30 a.m

1514
02:06:46,966 --> 02:06:48,934
Pizza shop?! What for?

1515
02:06:49,101 --> 02:06:52,264
Ramettan says, Killer had eaten
pizza just before the murder.

1516
02:06:52,972 --> 02:06:54,963
His hands had that smell, it seems!

1517
02:06:55,240 --> 02:07:00,007
But all the people in the flats had food
only from Sardarji's marriage function.

1518
02:07:00,379 --> 02:07:02,472
ln case the killer lives in that flat,

1519
02:07:03,048 --> 02:07:05,915
And if we can find out in which flat
pizza had been delivered.

1520
02:07:06,185 --> 02:07:08,415
Then we may get a hint about the
flat he resides.

1521
02:07:09,088 --> 02:07:12,080
However, it is good that you came here,
Jayaraman.

1522
02:07:15,127 --> 02:07:18,324
When l enquired on the basis of the details you
gave,

1523
02:07:18,931 --> 02:07:20,922
l understood it has some link with a case
l investigated in Crime branch.

1524
02:07:21,200 --> 02:07:22,258
lt's a coincidence!

1525
02:07:22,935 --> 02:07:26,462
All those who died were somehow
related to this rape case!

1526
02:07:27,206 --> 02:07:29,333
l got Vasu's photo from the jail.

1527
02:07:29,541 --> 02:07:30,405
lt may help us.

1528
02:07:32,544 --> 02:07:45,014
Team DrC

1529
02:07:45,758 --> 02:07:48,420
Pizza was delivered
to only one flat on that day.

1530
02:07:49,061 --> 02:07:51,325
That too at 6 p.m to Door no.1106.

1531
02:07:51,764 --> 02:07:54,028
Do you know who lives there?

1532
02:07:57,069 --> 02:07:58,036
Amina!!

1533
02:08:04,209 --> 02:08:07,042
Here is your stick.
Police came here looking for you.

1534
02:08:07,246 --> 02:08:10,704
Kunjakka, have you seen Amina's husband?

1535
02:08:13,252 --> 02:08:15,948
This is not my husband!
My husband's friend.

1536
02:08:16,188 --> 02:08:17,052
Does he live here?

1537
02:08:17,356 --> 02:08:20,018
No! He often comes here.

1538
02:08:20,225 --> 02:08:24,059
For the sake of my daughter's treatment,
he arranged this flat for me.

1539
02:08:25,097 --> 02:08:26,086
When will he come again?

1540
02:08:26,265 --> 02:08:27,664
He will not come.

1541
02:08:28,100 --> 02:08:28,759
He came yesterday..

1542
02:08:29,368 --> 02:08:31,461
And said he is
going back to work place in Dubai.

1543
02:08:32,738 --> 02:08:33,705
Does he have a phone?

1544
02:08:41,280 --> 02:08:43,339
Sorry, Mr.Swaminathan! She is a sponsored
child.

1545
02:08:44,049 --> 02:08:48,076
Apart from local guardian Jayaraman,
nobody else is permitted to see the child.

1546
02:08:48,287 --> 02:08:48,776
l'm sorry.

1547
02:08:49,688 --> 02:08:51,212
lt's not necessary to see her!

1548
02:08:52,091 --> 02:08:54,685
As she is the daughter of Krishnan uncle,
and as he is no more now,

1549
02:08:55,127 --> 02:08:57,186
Being his nephew, don't l
have some responsibilities?

1550
02:08:58,697 --> 02:09:02,656
State Bank of lndia, Kochi account no.1009797

1551
02:09:03,068 --> 02:09:06,231
From this account only, Krishnan uncle
used to transferthe fees amount!

1552
02:09:07,239 --> 02:09:09,799
Because is death and consequent nonpayment
of fees should not affect the child's education.

1553
02:09:10,142 --> 02:09:10,801
So l came here.

1554
02:09:11,810 --> 02:09:14,074
lf there are any dues in the fees,
l got the money with me.

1555
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:15,268
Can you please check ?

1556
02:09:15,481 --> 02:09:15,810
Hmm..one minute.

1557
02:09:18,684 --> 02:09:19,651
Connect to the accounts department

1558
02:09:21,787 --> 02:09:25,621
Yes, can you please check whether there is
any due in the fees of Nandini Moorthy - Std 7 D

1559
02:09:30,129 --> 02:09:34,088
Listen! Everyone can't go
together in the name of Diwali!

1560
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:38,633
lnform Staff that l will cut those 4 days pay.

1561
02:09:39,304 --> 02:09:42,171
l can't manage everything alone.

1562
02:09:43,208 --> 02:09:46,109
Entire fees for this year has been paid.

1563
02:09:48,147 --> 02:09:48,613
Hello bro!

1564
02:09:52,217 --> 02:09:54,617
Can you please give this to 7 D Nandini?

1565
02:09:59,258 --> 02:10:01,351
lt's Diwali, right? Keep it!

1566
02:10:06,098 --> 02:10:08,225
Then, did your dad say anything?
That doesn't matter.

1567
02:10:11,670 --> 02:10:13,160
Nandini - Here!

1568
02:10:39,932 --> 02:10:42,196
l also checked! His phone is switched off.

1569
02:10:42,668 --> 02:10:43,828
No point in trying.

1570
02:10:44,803 --> 02:10:46,361
Have this tea. Take it.

1571
02:10:49,875 --> 02:10:52,571
All these days,
Vasu was following me like a shadow

1572
02:10:53,245 --> 02:10:56,112
For reaching Nandini was possible
only through me.

1573
02:10:57,216 --> 02:10:59,776
Now, how did he come to know
the whereabouts of Nandini?

1574
02:11:00,919 --> 02:11:02,216
Therefore, he will not need my help anymore.

1575
02:11:12,231 --> 02:11:13,698
He is a psychopath!

1576
02:11:13,866 --> 02:11:15,800
He will not give a damn to your request!

1577
02:11:16,635 --> 02:11:19,604
l know. But l need to disclose a truth to him.

1578
02:11:20,272 --> 02:11:22,536
With that all his
vengeance and bitterness will end.

1579
02:11:22,808 --> 02:11:25,606
You will not be able to convince
a person with vengeance!

1580
02:11:25,811 --> 02:11:28,541
He will neither understand
nor be prepared to listen.

1581
02:11:28,747 --> 02:11:30,237
He will do. He must!

1582
02:11:30,983 --> 02:11:32,177
Do you know, Ganga,

1583
02:11:32,951 --> 02:11:35,613
the one whom he is trying to kill
is none than his own daughter!!

1584
02:11:59,811 --> 02:12:00,800
That child survived!

1585
02:12:01,213 --> 02:12:04,910
Vasudevan, who spent 4 yrs in a
mental asylum wasn't aware of it.

1586
02:12:05,550 --> 02:12:06,642
When he comes out afterthe sentence,

1587
02:12:06,852 --> 02:12:09,514
Moorthy Sir wanted to handover him his
daughter,

1588
02:12:09,721 --> 02:12:12,656
Only with that intention and atone for his guilt
Moorthy Sir brought her up!

1589
02:12:39,551 --> 02:12:42,645
Nandini! Someone has come to see you
with Diwali sweets.

1590
02:13:08,981 --> 02:13:10,676
l knew you would come!

1591
02:13:11,683 --> 02:13:13,981
-How?- l saw you in my dream last night.

1592
02:13:15,554 --> 02:13:17,681
That's great. Who told you that l have come?

1593
02:13:17,956 --> 02:13:20,652
Sistertold me someone has come
to see me with sweets.

1594
02:13:21,560 --> 02:13:23,790
Who else will come in search of me other than
you?

1595
02:13:24,563 --> 02:13:25,791
What? Sweets?

1596
02:13:28,567 --> 02:13:29,966
ls anyone around whom you aren't familiar
with?

1597
02:13:30,302 --> 02:13:30,734
Check!

1598
02:13:35,574 --> 02:13:36,905
Hello! l'm Ganga.

1599
02:13:37,109 --> 02:13:41,045
That man has reached here. He was here now.

1600
02:13:42,514 --> 02:13:43,845
Why don't we inform the police?

1601
02:13:45,517 --> 02:13:48,975
No use! lt's the truth only we both know.

1602
02:13:49,688 --> 02:13:50,848
Even if we disclose it,

1603
02:13:51,089 --> 02:13:52,989
nobody can arrest or punish him,.

1604
02:13:53,692 --> 02:13:56,058
However, it is not safe to let Nandini stay here.

1605
02:14:45,477 --> 02:14:46,569
O God! l forgot to get sugar.

1606
02:14:51,850 --> 02:14:55,547
Spoon...Thanks!

1607
02:15:24,483 --> 02:15:24,812
Come!

1608
02:15:25,317 --> 02:15:37,696
Team DrC

1609
02:15:37,963 --> 02:15:39,521
l informed everything to Sister!

1610
02:15:41,600 --> 02:15:43,568
Ganga showed me his photo.

1611
02:15:44,469 --> 02:15:45,697
He's the same man who came to school.

1612
02:15:46,004 --> 02:15:47,665
Don't worry. You can stay here.

1613
02:15:48,473 --> 02:15:49,565
Only l'm here now.

1614
02:15:50,442 --> 02:15:52,967
Rest of the teachers
have gone home for holidays.

1615
02:15:54,579 --> 02:15:56,706
There are 4 rooms upstairs. And also down.

1616
02:15:56,915 --> 02:15:59,213
You can stay wherever you like!

1617
02:16:08,460 --> 02:16:09,552
He was, along with us,

1618
02:16:11,463 --> 02:16:12,760
till we reached here!

1619
02:19:27,425 --> 02:19:28,687
Keep the coffee there and you go and sleep,
Sister!

1620
02:19:28,827 --> 02:19:30,089
l will take when l need it.

1621
02:19:33,798 --> 02:19:35,629
Don't forget to lock the door from inside.

1622
02:19:36,267 --> 02:19:38,098
Never open the door
if it's someone otherthan me.

1623
02:21:21,339 --> 02:21:23,432
Someone is standing beside the window!

1624
02:21:27,345 --> 02:21:28,539
Please listen to me, Vasu!

1625
02:21:29,347 --> 02:21:31,542
Nandini whom you are trying to kill
is none other than your own daughter!

1626
02:21:35,587 --> 02:21:38,556
l'm the Destroyer and you are the Protector!

1627
02:21:39,357 --> 02:21:44,317
When you realized that your efforts
will not work to rescue her ,

1628
02:21:44,596 --> 02:21:47,292
Are you trying to put me down emotionally?

1629
02:21:47,532 --> 02:21:50,524
l'm telling the truth. She is really your daughter.

1630
02:21:53,338 --> 02:21:54,396
Trust me, Vasu! She is your daughter.

1631
02:21:54,572 --> 02:21:57,132
l saw with my own eyes.

1632
02:21:57,575 --> 02:22:02,103
My child's body also along with the
frozen bodies of my otherfamily members!

1633
02:22:02,514 --> 02:22:07,281
No!! No attempts of yours can make me Back-
off!

1634
02:22:31,276 --> 02:22:32,470
Ramachha...on the right hand side.

1635
02:23:23,995 --> 02:23:25,462
Nandini...come.

1636
02:23:33,004 --> 02:23:34,096
Come here.

1637
02:23:41,446 --> 02:23:42,435
lt's locked.

1638
02:23:46,451 --> 02:23:47,179
lt's also locked.

1639
02:23:53,524 --> 02:23:54,320
Ramachha, come!

1640
02:23:55,994 --> 02:23:56,483
Gosh! lt's him!

1641
02:23:57,662 --> 02:25:48,094
Team DrC

1642
02:25:57,849 --> 02:25:59,111
Ramachha! Come.

1643
02:26:05,356 --> 02:26:07,790
All the doors are locked. Come!

1644
02:26:08,826 --> 02:26:10,225
Steps! Be careful!

1645
02:26:35,319 --> 02:26:37,651
That man is not yourfather!

1646
02:26:41,159 --> 02:26:43,821
Like the way l tell lies and cheat you,

1647
02:26:44,162 --> 02:26:46,187
l also told a lie and cheated him.

1648
02:28:10,281 --> 02:28:15,810
That man is coming
...with a mobile flashlight in his hand.

1649
02:28:42,580 --> 02:28:43,547
Where did you get this from?

1650
02:28:43,714 --> 02:28:44,806
Lying on the ground.

1651
02:28:44,982 --> 02:28:47,678
As it should not reach his hands,
l took and kept it.

1652
02:31:07,658 --> 02:31:10,991
Ramettan, Since a long time,
a man is waiting to see you!

1653
02:31:11,529 --> 02:31:11,824
Who?

1654
02:31:12,029 --> 02:31:14,429
l don't know him. l've not seen him before.

1655
02:31:23,474 --> 02:31:25,567
Jayarama, it's me.

1656
02:31:27,478 --> 02:31:29,070
-Baputty? - Hmm!

1657
02:31:30,481 --> 02:31:32,813
l don't know what excuse
to give and ask yourforgiveness.

1658
02:31:34,618 --> 02:31:38,577
l wasn't able to arrange the cash
on time as expected.

1659
02:31:39,990 --> 02:31:41,582
For the favour you did to me,

1660
02:31:41,992 --> 02:31:43,960
l'd given you only hardships in return!

1661
02:31:45,496 --> 02:31:47,828
Like pleading God, l plead you..

1662
02:31:48,999 --> 02:31:50,432
Please don't curse me.

1663
02:31:50,768 --> 02:31:53,601
Hey no! All of us are human beings, Baputty?

1664
02:31:54,772 --> 02:31:56,603
All of us face such situations!

1665
02:31:57,508 --> 02:31:59,976
l had confidence that you will not betray me.

1666
02:32:01,011 --> 02:32:02,672
Like the way we believe there is God,

1667
02:32:02,847 --> 02:32:05,042
l believed that
you will also come one day.

1668
02:32:06,016 --> 02:32:10,976
Here.. your property deed.
l settled all the dues to Varghese.

1669
02:32:12,490 --> 02:32:14,758
Can you do me a favour?

1670
02:32:14,758 --> 02:32:16,589
Sure, tell me.

1671
02:32:16,760 --> 02:32:19,695
Handover this to Kannan. lt is entitled to them.

1672
02:32:20,998 --> 02:32:25,662
Why will l, who has no kith and kin,
need these properties?

1673
02:32:36,447 --> 02:32:38,005
Don't ask where l'm going.

1674
02:32:38,582 --> 02:32:41,949
When there is a need, just give me a call
l will be there.

1675
02:32:51,262 --> 02:32:51,694
Sister...

1676
02:32:53,564 --> 02:32:56,761
Sister...this is... for the child.

1677
02:33:03,707 --> 02:33:05,231
Sending me away?

1678
02:33:06,577 --> 02:33:07,669
That is how the things are, dear!

1679
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:16,511
Whoever we think, as own,
will leave us one day.

1680
02:33:17,922 --> 02:33:19,549
Again, we are destined to live

1681
02:33:19,924 --> 02:33:22,916
Sometimes, without also knowing
for whom and what purpose!

1682
02:33:23,961 --> 02:33:25,656
No factors should undermine us!

1683
02:33:27,698 --> 02:33:30,531
-Shall l say that in English? - Hmm!

1684
02:33:30,935 --> 02:33:31,902
That is LlFE!

1685
02:33:34,705 --> 02:33:36,900
My child should study well and come up in life!

1686
02:33:38,909 --> 02:33:43,744
From some corner of the World,
this Ramachhan will keep praying for you daily.

1687
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:45,739
Get going.

1688
02:33:53,691 --> 02:33:54,749
Shall l ask you something, Ramachha?

1689
02:33:57,561 --> 02:33:59,722
Didn't you say...

1690
02:34:00,197 --> 02:34:02,256
lf we feel there is someone of our own,

1691
02:34:02,633 --> 02:34:04,157
Life will be full of thrill!

1692
02:34:04,935 --> 02:34:06,766
Just a while ago you said,

1693
02:34:07,204 --> 02:34:08,933
that you have nobody of your own.

1694
02:34:09,640 --> 02:34:10,732
Am l also not like you?

1695
02:34:11,342 --> 02:34:13,776
So, you, be my company

1696
02:34:14,178 --> 02:34:16,347
And l, be yours!

1697
02:34:16,347 --> 02:34:17,609
Won't the life be full of thrill?

1698
02:34:22,186 --> 02:34:23,847
Hey, you naughty girl!

1699
02:34:24,855 --> 02:34:26,720
Then, why don't we become like that?

1700
02:34:28,859 --> 02:34:32,329
Then, take my gift!

1701
02:34:32,329 --> 02:34:32,852
What is that?
