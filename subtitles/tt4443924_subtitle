1
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,252
Janaki...

2
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:01,928
At this tender age.

3
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:22,796
{\an8}Your sister is no more, Niranjan.

4
00:02:34,857 --> 00:02:36,109
Dad...

5
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,911
{\an8}She was waiting only for you.

6
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,611
Niranjan, rush to the hospital!
It's a baby girl!

7
00:03:52,694 --> 00:03:54,239
Your sister has been born!

8
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:58,162
What are you doing?

9
00:04:38,687 --> 00:04:41,150
{\an8}-Jot it down in your notebook.
-Can I come in, madam?

10
00:04:42,318 --> 00:04:43,570
Why are you late?

11
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:13,328
Hold this.

12
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:43,185
Balasaheb, why don't you
send Niranjan to Dubai?

13
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:46,190
Youngsters can find jobs easily there.

14
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,319
Should I arrange it for you?

15
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,442
Mali Dinesh?

16
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:14,654
Naik Niranjan?

17
00:07:14,904 --> 00:07:16,949
{\an8}Miss, he has left school and the village.

18
00:07:50,588 --> 00:07:52,383
Sir, the internet bill is pending.

19
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:54,219
Janaki Naik.

20
00:07:58,602 --> 00:08:00,688
-When did...
-Yesterday morning.

21
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:02,024
Four thousand?

22
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:09,536
Sir, these are dirhams.

23
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:30,237
{\an8}Janaki was like my big sister.

24
00:08:30,321 --> 00:08:34,870
{\an8}I don't have a sister,
so she let me call her sister.

25
00:08:35,079 --> 00:08:39,920
I was nervous for
the first two months of class.

26
00:08:40,003 --> 00:08:41,589
I just couldn't sing.

27
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:47,766
So Janaki-tai held me back after class
and took me up to the terrace.

28
00:08:47,892 --> 00:08:51,731
She told me not to worry if I was bored
of singing classical music.

29
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:53,902
Sing the song I will teach you.

30
00:08:54,194 --> 00:08:56,406
<i>This backward world bothers me</i>

31
00:08:56,489 --> 00:09:01,247
<i>The awkward situation kills me</i>

32
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:04,210
<i>O dear God, please listen to me</i>

33
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:11,180
Just like I had no sister,
she had no brother.

34
00:09:11,681 --> 00:09:15,437
I mean, she had a brother,
but he was never around.

35
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:20,028
He would often give her new phones,
but he never called her.

36
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:22,240
Janaki-tai was awesome

37
00:09:22,365 --> 00:09:25,746
because she had an unlimited
download plan on her cell phone.

38
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:28,167
<i>She had taught me to play</i>
<i>an instrument with one hand</i>

39
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,754
<i>while playing games with the other.</i>

40
00:09:30,838 --> 00:09:32,382
Avoid that path.

41
00:09:32,465 --> 00:09:35,303
Mr. Rangrav lives there,
he owns the car.

42
00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:40,938
How long will you keep using cars
that are sent here for repair?

43
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:44,193
Why not tell me and buy your own car?

44
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,412
I don't need a car
to commute within the village.

45
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:54,585
Janaki was fond of cars...

46
00:09:54,836 --> 00:09:57,382
We would have bought her one.

47
00:09:57,966 --> 00:09:59,218
Please stop weeping.

48
00:10:00,136 --> 00:10:02,306
All the guests that gathered
in the house to weep...

49
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,727
I didn't even recognize
ninety percent of those faces.

50
00:10:05,687 --> 00:10:08,316
The moment I step out,
all the villagers embrace me and weep.

51
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,405
The betel nut vendor embraces me,
the petrol pump guy hugs me.

52
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,201
What nonsense. The other day--

53
00:10:27,014 --> 00:10:28,391
I'll take a look.

54
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:33,400
A car that's sent for repairs
will obviously break down.

55
00:10:52,598 --> 00:10:54,727
Dad, I...

56
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,354
You settled down there and slogged away

57
00:10:57,982 --> 00:11:00,611
so that we could all be prosperous here.

58
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:04,201
However, I couldn't save all the money.

59
00:11:06,162 --> 00:11:10,002
Janaki's hospital bills, her medicines...

60
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:13,883
we paid them continuously
for the past five years.

61
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:16,930
I couldn't buy a car.

62
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:21,479
But we tried our best to
make sure she was happy.

63
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:23,566
Sorry, Father.

64
00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:27,322
If you still want to be cross with me,
then suit yourself.

65
00:11:55,536 --> 00:11:56,662
Have a bite.

66
00:11:56,788 --> 00:11:59,542
I made your favorite vegetables
specially for you.

67
00:12:00,252 --> 00:12:02,589
I never eat this early.

68
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,931
The banks here offer
such a pathetic interest rate.

69
00:12:08,557 --> 00:12:11,979
Why are these 150,000 rupees
parked in savings?

70
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,692
What are your future plans?

71
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,111
As in?

72
00:12:17,656 --> 00:12:19,408
Stay here. Don't leave.

73
00:12:19,742 --> 00:12:21,704
I'm here until next Monday.

74
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:28,256
Hello and welcome, Hessan.

75
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,761
No, I will have to deal
with this problem later.

76
00:12:31,428 --> 00:12:33,807
I am a little busy right now.
I will talk to you later.

77
00:12:34,892 --> 00:12:37,104
I will call you back. Goodbye.

78
00:12:38,231 --> 00:12:41,487
I cannot talk right now. I am busy.

79
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,368
I will call you later. Goodbye.

80
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:53,131
What exactly do you do for a living?

81
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:55,426
A couple of things.

82
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:58,557
What's your blood group?

83
00:13:00,894 --> 00:13:02,521
They ask all sorts of questions nowadays.

84
00:13:03,148 --> 00:13:07,530
Mrs. Gupte runs a marriage bureau
and will suggest some prospective brides.

85
00:13:08,031 --> 00:13:09,074
Look at these photos of girls.

86
00:13:09,157 --> 00:13:10,368
Women.

87
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:12,663
We must look for women for me.

88
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,879
Anyway, I don't have time for all this.

89
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,510
Dad, I'll be back in six months.

90
00:13:20,593 --> 00:13:23,890
Wind up everything here,
let's go to Dubai for good.

91
00:13:24,099 --> 00:13:26,019
There is no way we're leaving this place.

92
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:27,980
What's holding us back here?

93
00:13:28,606 --> 00:13:31,110
Not you, perhaps. Holding us back.

94
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,503
Is there a car in a working condition?

95
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:43,005
Where you off to now?

96
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:45,009
To see a friend.

97
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:47,012
Please don't go now.

98
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:49,140
We have guests staying over.
It doesn't look good.

99
00:13:49,432 --> 00:13:50,935
Your aunt will be cross.

100
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,107
He's a grown-up man.

101
00:13:55,025 --> 00:13:58,155
Your emotional threats
won't work now. Relax.

102
00:14:00,242 --> 00:14:05,835
Avoid the main road
where the Parsi fellow lives.

103
00:14:06,252 --> 00:14:07,588
That old car is his.

104
00:14:07,796 --> 00:14:08,714
OK.

105
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,832
Please, let's go home.

106
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,052
Who are you?

107
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:53,144
What a fantastic question.

108
00:18:54,229 --> 00:18:55,481
Try and guess.

109
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:03,912
Look here, you are just some random girl
who happens to resemble my sister.

110
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:06,875
What do you want?

111
00:19:06,958 --> 00:19:08,461
What are you doing here?

112
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:10,798
Please, hop in.

113
00:19:10,923 --> 00:19:12,801
Come on, let's go home.

114
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:14,554
I'll explain later.

115
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:53,076
Come on, Niranjan. Let's go.

116
00:20:29,637 --> 00:20:33,351
Shameless! I died barely ten days ago.

117
00:20:34,186 --> 00:20:37,233
We're catching up after three years or so,
not to quarrel and bicker.

118
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:38,819
Who are you?

119
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:41,281
What do you call a dead person
who comes back?

120
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,161
-A ghost!
-Phew! Finally.

121
00:20:44,745 --> 00:20:47,667
Come on, move it. Get in the car.
I'll explain everything.

122
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:51,673
Please, hang on.

123
00:20:52,132 --> 00:20:54,052
I've been waiting for you.

124
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:02,483
Please don't be afraid of me.

125
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:06,156
I won't hurt you.

126
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:15,421
Don't be mean. Please.

127
00:21:30,446 --> 00:21:32,616
How can I trust you?

128
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:37,583
I can only ask you to trust me.
The rest is up to you.

129
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,850
I need your help...

130
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:52,065
to finish a task.

131
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,454
Come on. Please!

132
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:50,495
The red dress meant for me...
you threw it in the river, didn't you?

133
00:22:57,089 --> 00:23:01,472
How did you become...

134
00:23:01,722 --> 00:23:03,266
a ghost?

135
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:07,774
Give me a clear answer.

136
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:11,530
I'm not a certified ghost, OK?

137
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,827
I'm still trying to figure things out.
I don't know yet. I'm confused.

138
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:19,001
Are you only visible to me, or...?

139
00:23:20,086 --> 00:23:21,797
Check it out yourself, dude.

140
00:23:24,844 --> 00:23:27,598
Care for some tea?
And a piping hot snack?

141
00:23:27,723 --> 00:23:30,561
How many days...
will you be visible to me?

142
00:23:32,314 --> 00:23:34,443
What a barrage of questions!

143
00:23:34,652 --> 00:23:36,780
Aren't you just glad I'm here?

144
00:23:36,947 --> 00:23:39,743
Yes, of course.

145
00:23:42,081 --> 00:23:43,708
I'm having a ball too.

146
00:23:48,591 --> 00:23:50,803
I finally got rid of that illness.

147
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,434
Look, I have normal nails...

148
00:23:55,269 --> 00:23:56,855
and a normal tongue.

149
00:23:57,314 --> 00:23:59,902
My feet are straight too,
and I have a shadow.

150
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,950
Do I look like a ghost?
Don't be afraid.

151
00:24:08,082 --> 00:24:12,464
Do you have any unfulfilled wishes?

152
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:20,185
You watch too many
bad horror movies, dude!

153
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,900
Hey, watch it!

154
00:24:52,197 --> 00:24:53,908
Dude, just get me some tea from the house.

155
00:25:11,395 --> 00:25:15,819
Mother, tell me.

156
00:25:16,904 --> 00:25:19,158
What's... what's this?

157
00:25:25,168 --> 00:25:26,420
Tell me, Mother.

158
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:29,216
But don't cry.

159
00:25:33,223 --> 00:25:35,769
Did Janaki have...

160
00:25:38,022 --> 00:25:41,027
any unfulfilled wishes?

161
00:25:42,697 --> 00:25:44,700
She missed you.

162
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:49,166
She kept asking "When will he come?"

163
00:25:51,378 --> 00:25:57,179
She was so weak. Tubes inserted...
in the throat, in her hands.

164
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:09,116
Her clothes...
go and take them to the temple.

165
00:26:09,408 --> 00:26:13,581
A needy girl can take them and use them.

166
00:26:18,047 --> 00:26:20,593
What's all this? When is she leaving?

167
00:26:20,885 --> 00:26:22,346
Don't be so rude.

168
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:27,354
She is cleansing the house.

169
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:29,524
She has divine enlightenment.

170
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:32,571
The soul haunts the home
for 12 days apparently.

171
00:26:33,197 --> 00:26:34,533
Hence, this ritual.

172
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:37,913
Guys, give me a bite!

173
00:26:38,331 --> 00:26:40,835
I've been begging for tea.

174
00:26:41,628 --> 00:26:44,633
Hey, don't rummage through my things!

175
00:26:54,065 --> 00:26:56,653
Hello, Rustom Bakers?

176
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:03,664
I am calling from Balasaheb's garage.

177
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,753
Your car is ready for delivery.

178
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:12,596
Balasaheb is fine.

179
00:27:15,225 --> 00:27:16,728
Yes, it was tragic.

180
00:27:18,564 --> 00:27:21,277
Yes, blood cancer.

181
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:28,455
Yes, we're grieving.

182
00:27:28,539 --> 00:27:30,083
Please pick up your car.

183
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,936
What's wrong?

184
00:27:58,672 --> 00:28:04,098
<i>People feel arousal before sex</i>
<i>is the only way to increase sexual desire</i>

185
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:10,358
<i>but the truth is that your body is</i>
<i>always in an aroused state...</i>

186
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:12,236
Come and have lunch.

187
00:28:12,862 --> 00:28:14,532
<i>Your nervous system...</i>

188
00:28:22,044 --> 00:28:24,256
He's always rushing back and forth.

189
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:26,426
Should've taken time off
and come on vacation.

190
00:28:26,802 --> 00:28:28,430
Same old story every day.

191
00:28:28,764 --> 00:28:30,683
I'm here until Monday.

192
00:28:31,894 --> 00:28:35,274
Fortunately, all the guests have left.
It's such a pain.

193
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:36,944
Don't say that.

194
00:28:38,363 --> 00:28:40,742
Close ones must be
with the family for a few days.

195
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:45,416
It helps ease the pain.
Why do you care?

196
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,461
You kids just wipe your tears and toss--

197
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:49,214
<i>Niranjan!</i>

198
00:28:49,882 --> 00:28:51,635
-You're ashamed...
<i>-Bring food!</i>

199
00:28:51,718 --> 00:28:54,222
-to break down or open up.
<i>-Niranjan!</i>

200
00:28:54,473 --> 00:28:55,808
So these strange thoughts...

201
00:28:55,892 --> 00:28:57,853
-haunt the mind.
<i>-I've been famished since afternoon.</i>

202
00:28:58,772 --> 00:29:00,149
<i>I am going to die again!</i>

203
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:01,860
Janaki appeared in my dream.

204
00:29:01,943 --> 00:29:04,155
-She wanted me to prepare sweets.
<i>-Niranjan!</i>

205
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:06,952
Tomorrow I'll do that.

206
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,377
Have mercy, guys.

207
00:30:16,024 --> 00:30:18,612
Yuck... terrible dill curry!
I don't like it.

208
00:30:20,741 --> 00:30:22,160
Let's go to McDonald's.

209
00:30:22,452 --> 00:30:24,038
It's 15 kilometers away.

210
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,458
Shut up and eat.

211
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,273
What's going on?

212
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:43,361
No clue.

213
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:47,618
If you have any...
unfulfilled wishes or whatever

214
00:30:47,911 --> 00:30:49,538
tell me and I'll fulfill it.

215
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,333
Go away. I must leave too.

216
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,880
Nothing of the sort.
I am happy.

217
00:30:56,633 --> 00:30:59,722
Let's just go gallivanting
all over the place.

218
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:01,558
Let's have a blast.

219
00:31:01,892 --> 00:31:06,441
I haven't even roamed around with you,
not even chatted at leisure.

220
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:09,780
Why do you want to chat?

221
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:12,910
That's so rude!

222
00:31:13,453 --> 00:31:15,915
Can't you speak affectionately
to a dead person?

223
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,920
Get some bread.

224
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:20,131
It's all gone.

225
00:31:25,807 --> 00:31:27,893
Just buy this Happy Journey.

226
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,443
-"Happy Journey"?
-Yeah. This van...

227
00:31:33,194 --> 00:31:34,655
was my private ambulance.

228
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:40,372
Dad would drive me to hospital in it
when there were emergencies at odd hours.

229
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,711
The van was sick, like me.

230
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:48,010
It's been standing in the same place
for four or five years.

231
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:53,561
Just buy it.
I'm gonna hang in here for a few days.

232
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,317
Sure, why not?

233
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:02,868
Buy the van, the house, paint it...

234
00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:04,955
build a new garage for Dad.

235
00:32:05,372 --> 00:32:07,083
Niranjan, do this, do that.

236
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,170
Who cares what he wants?

237
00:32:10,965 --> 00:32:13,469
I also fail to see how long
Mom and Dad need me here.

238
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:16,724
Or should I return
and continue earning money?

239
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:24,612
I was little more than a schoolkid

240
00:32:25,781 --> 00:32:27,450
when they uprooted me
and sent me away to Dubai.

241
00:32:29,412 --> 00:32:31,749
No one even asked me.
They just told me.

242
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,295
Now you're doing the same.

243
00:32:35,422 --> 00:32:36,883
Sure, I'll buy it.

244
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:41,682
You were always here,
even though you were away.

245
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:44,979
They love you.

246
00:32:45,439 --> 00:32:46,983
It's you that they love.

247
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,656
The family or whatever
is just the three of you.

248
00:32:53,034 --> 00:32:54,495
I have always been an outsider.

249
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,318
Hey, your internet bill was four grand!

250
00:33:14,028 --> 00:33:16,240
You know, 231 dinars is not a joke.

251
00:33:16,782 --> 00:33:18,243
It's only while I'm here.

252
00:33:18,326 --> 00:33:21,707
After I'm gone, you can go back
to your miserly plan of 256 rupees.

253
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,253
Don't tell me you want internet in here!

254
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:26,256
Yup!

255
00:33:26,632 --> 00:33:29,470
Life without Wi-Fi is no life, my boy.

256
00:33:29,804 --> 00:33:32,642
My basic needs are food,
clothing, shelter, and Wi-Fi.

257
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:35,480
And get me an iPad.

258
00:33:37,274 --> 00:33:38,986
Learn to gift fancy things.

259
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,241
I'm fed up of meager offerings
worth 101 bucks.

260
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,720
By the way, you're so naughty!

261
00:33:54,887 --> 00:34:00,605
I found all your pen drives... and all
the porn videos you've saved on them.

262
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:05,237
Listen, I'm warning you,
return my pen drives.

263
00:34:05,321 --> 00:34:07,199
They are private, they are mine, I...

264
00:34:12,833 --> 00:34:14,294
Niranjan Naik speaking.

265
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,548
How about my air ticket?

266
00:34:18,092 --> 00:34:19,302
Monday?

267
00:34:19,553 --> 00:34:21,556
I wouldn't mind flying a day earlier.

268
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:27,482
My work here is done.
Alright, I am free now.

269
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:35,788
Okay. Mumbai to Dubai.

270
00:34:35,871 --> 00:34:37,290
-Yeah.
-Niranjan, please.

271
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:40,379
Hello? Please mail it.

272
00:36:33,984 --> 00:36:35,319
Yes?

273
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:41,914
If I stay here another eight days--

274
00:36:41,997 --> 00:36:42,873
Fifteen.

275
00:36:43,917 --> 00:36:45,628
-Eight.
-Fifteen.

276
00:36:46,379 --> 00:36:48,132
Eight. What's the plan?

277
00:36:50,928 --> 00:36:52,222
This is my time.

278
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:54,267
I can do whatever I wish.

279
00:37:00,444 --> 00:37:01,696
Wow!

280
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,533
What's the password?

281
00:37:04,868 --> 00:37:06,204
-I'll unlock it.
-Please tell me.

282
00:37:06,287 --> 00:37:07,498
-I'll open.
-Tell me.

283
00:37:20,936 --> 00:37:24,860
Hey, just buy Happy Journey.

284
00:37:25,235 --> 00:37:26,446
Have you lost it?

285
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,479
It's a total of six bags, ma'am.

286
00:37:47,313 --> 00:37:51,404
No, we haven't ordered all this.
We don't use such things.

287
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:54,534
Mom, your bank work is sorted.
Go for your signatures before 11 a.m.

288
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:57,455
-Yes.
-Long.com, sir.

289
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,375
Niranjan Naik?

290
00:37:59,459 --> 00:38:01,545
Yes, but I haven't ordered all this.

291
00:38:01,837 --> 00:38:03,632
Sir, the address seems to be right.

292
00:38:04,342 --> 00:38:08,140
The address is right...
wait, 170,000 rupees?

293
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,226
I am not going to pay for this.

294
00:38:33,223 --> 00:38:34,600
What...

295
00:38:34,976 --> 00:38:37,522
-Purchases worth 150,000 rupees!
<i>-You... please take my address again.</i>

296
00:38:37,605 --> 00:38:39,191
-What's wrong with him?
<i>-Yes, please.</i>

297
00:38:39,274 --> 00:38:40,819
He just lost his sister.

298
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,613
Does it look good?
How will people react?

299
00:38:42,697 --> 00:38:44,533
It's alright, it could be work-related.

300
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:46,328
Come, make me some tea.

301
00:38:47,121 --> 00:38:49,458
-Work-related?
-That is my address. I am confirming it.

302
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:51,628
Now, don't jump through the window,
for heaven's sake!

303
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,757
Yes.

304
00:39:22,763 --> 00:39:27,396
<i>The insolent heart doesn't agree...</i>

305
00:39:30,818 --> 00:39:35,033
So, it was you who ordered all this stuff,
using my bank details!

306
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:38,205
You find this funny?
How dare you? First, you die.

307
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,970
Has everything arrived?

308
00:39:47,137 --> 00:39:49,558
Look at your pale clerical attire.

309
00:39:49,683 --> 00:39:51,269
No wonder you're still single.

310
00:39:51,394 --> 00:39:53,522
Try the clothes I got you.
You'll look hot.

311
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:56,861
Janaki's ghost or whoever you are...

312
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:59,866
I do not approve of this prank at all.

313
00:40:00,284 --> 00:40:01,828
Money doesn't grow on trees, okay?

314
00:40:01,995 --> 00:40:04,457
I've been slogging away since childhood

315
00:40:04,666 --> 00:40:08,422
to earn for my family,
for my folks, for Janaki.

316
00:40:11,636 --> 00:40:15,100
Hey, it's our very first argument!
Come on! Bring it on!

317
00:40:15,726 --> 00:40:19,232
I don't believe you.
You are the limit!

318
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:22,946
Do you even know
how much I've been billed?

319
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,701
I'm sure you'll earn it later on.

320
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,330
But your appearance needs to rock.

321
00:40:30,626 --> 00:40:32,504
I mean, why? Why?

322
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:39,098
To channelize your earnings.

323
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:45,358
All you do is worry about us,
and send us money.

324
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:48,739
You never take a vacation.

325
00:40:51,994 --> 00:40:55,333
We hardly met while I was alive.

326
00:41:01,176 --> 00:41:05,224
People exist and then they
suddenly vanish one day.

327
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:07,228
They disappear.

328
00:41:10,692 --> 00:41:13,613
All of you suffered for my sake.

329
00:41:17,036 --> 00:41:18,413
But I passed away. Right?

330
00:41:23,797 --> 00:41:26,176
Give me the iPad.

331
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:29,974
Give me the iPad! Give me the iPad!

332
00:41:30,057 --> 00:41:31,435
No way!

333
00:41:41,409 --> 00:41:44,247
Hey, don't cry.

334
00:41:46,334 --> 00:41:48,171
Don't cry.

335
00:41:49,464 --> 00:41:51,676
Okay, here!

336
00:41:57,853 --> 00:42:03,279
Janaki, I have never spent
so much money on myself.

337
00:42:05,282 --> 00:42:07,536
Nor have I received
such extravagant gifts.

338
00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:14,756
I'm not used to all this.
I don't like it.

339
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:21,184
-Go away! Leave!
-Janaki, I am sorry.

340
00:42:21,267 --> 00:42:23,646
-Go away.
-Listen to me.

341
00:42:26,067 --> 00:42:31,284
Janaki, listen...

342
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,419
Janaki.

343
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:16,650
You left for Dubai
when you were sixteen, right?

344
00:43:19,906 --> 00:43:22,118
I was thirteen or fourteen.

345
00:43:23,954 --> 00:43:26,166
I was a laborer at first.

346
00:43:28,295 --> 00:43:30,757
Ten, twelve of us crammed in a room.

347
00:43:32,427 --> 00:43:34,847
All of our passports
were with our employer.

348
00:43:36,934 --> 00:43:39,480
Three years later,
he asked me to work in an office.

349
00:43:40,982 --> 00:43:42,777
He taught me about computers.

350
00:43:46,742 --> 00:43:50,039
Did you have... a girlfriend?

351
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:57,176
A laborer? In Dubai? With a girlfriend?

352
00:44:06,274 --> 00:44:08,361
Then I left for Iran.

353
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:12,618
I was twenty-three and knew computers.

354
00:44:13,453 --> 00:44:17,376
I had a good knowledge of sales
and most importantly...

355
00:44:17,752 --> 00:44:20,131
I could survive on one meal a day.

356
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:26,349
So I never faced any problems.

357
00:44:27,393 --> 00:44:28,770
Ever.

358
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:35,781
May I have some beer?

359
00:44:36,616 --> 00:44:38,745
Certainly not! You can't have any beer.

360
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:42,459
Hey! Don't cramp my style
like an elder brother.

361
00:44:42,835 --> 00:44:46,299
There's no way I am gonna worship
Your Highness like a good little sister.

362
00:44:49,346 --> 00:44:51,015
Pass me the beer.

363
00:44:53,477 --> 00:44:54,813
O, dear brother of mine.

364
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:04,454
Hey!

365
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,849
<i>Like the gusts of wind</i>
<i>In the haunting woods</i>

366
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:10,396
<i>The heart is full of sweet interludes</i>

367
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,320
<i>Behold, I come, alive and aloud</i>

368
00:46:14,403 --> 00:46:17,658
<i>Fresh is my voice,</i>
<i>Fresh is the sound</i>

369
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:19,453
<i>Fresh!</i>

370
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:22,291
<i>Fresh!</i>

371
00:46:24,795 --> 00:46:26,340
<i>Fresh!</i>

372
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:29,219
<i>Fresh!</i>

373
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:34,478
<i>He's an unreachable dork</i>

374
00:46:34,561 --> 00:46:37,859
<i>I'll demolish all of his walls</i>

375
00:46:38,109 --> 00:46:41,740
<i>Life runs out before you know</i>

376
00:46:41,823 --> 00:46:45,121
<i>Brother, you better follow</i>

377
00:46:45,371 --> 00:46:52,007
<i>Oh brother, let me swing high</i>

378
00:46:52,216 --> 00:46:58,852
<i>I've got no wings but I'll still fly</i>

379
00:47:04,611 --> 00:47:07,908
Routine is his protein,
he hates change.

380
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,499
His phone is old
and he is out of range.

381
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:16,089
Behold his face,
worse than a blackboard.

382
00:47:16,631 --> 00:47:21,431
I'll tear his mask off,
for once and for all.

383
00:47:21,514 --> 00:47:26,022
I'll wring him out for good.

384
00:47:26,314 --> 00:47:28,108
<i>Celebrate</i>

385
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:29,861
<i>Oh brother!</i>

386
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:32,199
<i>Earn and have fun!</i>

387
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:33,325
UDWA

388
00:47:33,868 --> 00:47:40,045
<i>Now with no constraints,</i>
<i>There's no stress</i>

389
00:47:40,629 --> 00:47:43,509
<i>Life is new, the air so pure</i>

390
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:46,806
<i>My eyes go crazy fresh</i>

391
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,437
<i>Upon the dew, the heart dances</i>

392
00:47:50,521 --> 00:47:53,484
<i>The heart is sunk in cream</i>

393
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:54,485
TAN TRUM

394
00:47:54,652 --> 00:48:00,328
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>Let's never come out of this dream</i>

395
00:48:00,913 --> 00:48:07,591
<i>Oh brother, let me swing high</i>

396
00:48:07,757 --> 00:48:14,310
<i>I've got no wings but I'll still fly</i>

397
00:48:16,318 --> 00:48:18,108
"MOTHER'S KINDNESS" - "FATHER'S BLESSINGS"
"TO HELL WITH YOU"

398
00:48:18,233 --> 00:48:19,527
<i>Fresh!</i>

399
00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:22,574
<i>Fresh!</i>

400
00:48:24,911 --> 00:48:26,580
<i>Fresh!</i>

401
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:29,293
<i>Fresh!</i>

402
00:48:31,756 --> 00:48:33,258
<i>Fresh!</i>

403
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:36,263
<i>Fresh!</i>

404
00:48:38,642 --> 00:48:40,186
<i>Fresh!</i>

405
00:48:41,563 --> 00:48:43,233
<i>Fresh!</i>

406
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:18,833
Oh my god, Janaki, these things
are so expensive in this country!

407
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,925
Yes, but, something plain...

408
00:49:25,136 --> 00:49:27,014
Alright, don't yell. I'll buy it.

409
00:49:38,533 --> 00:49:40,160
Niranjan?

410
00:49:44,584 --> 00:49:45,962
Hi.

411
00:49:47,631 --> 00:49:49,175
Hi.

412
00:49:51,095 --> 00:49:54,643
Me? I mean... my...

413
00:49:56,563 --> 00:49:57,982
It's been a long time.

414
00:50:05,828 --> 00:50:07,205
Chumbak?

415
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:10,502
Wait with Mom. I'm fine here.

416
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:31,829
Are you here with your family?

417
00:50:52,697 --> 00:50:54,867
What a man!
You've come back empty-handed.

418
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,351
How long will you be here?

419
00:51:11,228 --> 00:51:12,397
Eight, ten days.

420
00:51:12,897 --> 00:51:15,485
I... I emailed you.

421
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,243
I didn't receive them.

422
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:25,752
I can't talk much right now.
Let's catch up again, please.

423
00:51:27,547 --> 00:51:29,926
It's not really possible during this trip.

424
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:42,029
<i>Niranjan?</i>

425
00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:48,665
<i>No questions, please.</i>

426
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:27,996
Did you see that?

427
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,458
There's something fishy going on.

428
00:53:32,086 --> 00:53:33,839
Yesterday, I was near the van.

429
00:53:34,674 --> 00:53:38,054
I spotted lipstick and beer cans.

430
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:40,559
Has he brought home
a woman, or what?

431
00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:43,146
It looks like it.

432
00:53:44,315 --> 00:53:45,984
His sister has just passed away...

433
00:53:46,151 --> 00:53:49,114
and now this,
right in front of our very eyes!

434
00:53:49,323 --> 00:53:50,617
We are helpless.

435
00:53:51,535 --> 00:53:56,042
Be happy that it's a woman and not a man!

436
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,670
You are right.

437
00:53:59,465 --> 00:54:00,967
Shall I follow her?

438
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,682
I will arm-twist her into marrying him.

439
00:54:04,807 --> 00:54:06,017
Are you mad?

440
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:08,981
Not all women are worthy of marriage.

441
00:54:09,523 --> 00:54:10,775
Come back inside.

442
00:54:59,523 --> 00:55:00,942
How are you?

443
00:55:09,414 --> 00:55:11,876
I'll be leaving in seven or eight days.

444
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,881
And I'll be back in a month.

445
00:55:29,531 --> 00:55:31,242
Did you ever miss me?

446
00:55:37,293 --> 00:55:38,879
I am confused.

447
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:43,721
I'm not used to being
with someone all the time.

448
00:55:45,307 --> 00:55:47,101
Or living with them.

449
00:55:58,996 --> 00:56:01,333
I still lead a schoolgirl's life.

450
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,148
by a bodyguard.

451
00:56:15,774 --> 00:56:19,822
They don't realize it.
I am fed up of everything.

452
00:56:27,293 --> 00:56:30,840
Isn't your dad a politician these days?

453
00:56:32,677 --> 00:56:33,971
At the moment.

454
00:56:35,181 --> 00:56:37,727
You know his previous occupation.

455
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:04,020
Tea!

456
00:57:14,955 --> 00:57:16,875
Niranjan!

457
00:57:21,758 --> 00:57:23,511
Are you here for a few days?

458
00:57:27,935 --> 00:57:30,481
Every morning,
I come here alone to pray.

459
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:32,776
-At 7 a.m.
-At 7 a.m.

460
00:57:36,783 --> 00:57:42,918
I mean, without your bodyguard... Chumbak?

461
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:46,591
That's not his name.

462
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:49,763
He is my cousin, Sakharam Wankudre.

463
00:57:49,971 --> 00:57:52,851
But Papa deployed him to be with me 24/7.

464
00:57:53,644 --> 00:57:57,025
He is constantly by my side,
so I call him Chumbak, "magnet."

465
00:57:58,193 --> 00:57:59,905
But why do you need a bodyguard

466
00:58:00,197 --> 00:58:03,035
following you from your house
to the car and back?

467
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:06,958
But you know how paranoid Papa is.

468
00:58:07,501 --> 00:58:09,462
With his complicated past.

469
00:58:10,297 --> 00:58:14,637
He's always hallucinating that armed men
are trying to kidnap me.

470
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:18,310
Thanks to him, I'm still single.

471
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:24,612
I am not married.

472
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:43,978
-Good morning, Father.
-Good morning. Have a good day, son.

473
00:58:44,061 --> 00:58:45,188
Yeah, good day.

474
00:58:51,114 --> 00:58:53,994
-How about a beer?
-This early in the morning?

475
00:58:54,286 --> 00:58:55,413
So what?

476
00:58:56,081 --> 00:58:58,335
-Yup! Come on!
-No.

477
00:58:58,418 --> 00:59:00,630
-Come on! It's a fantastic idea.
-Shut up.

478
00:59:00,714 --> 00:59:03,426
-Please, I haven't even had my tea.
-No.

479
01:02:12,072 --> 01:02:14,451
Now what? What should I say?

480
01:02:22,464 --> 01:02:23,967
Introduce yourself.

481
01:02:27,431 --> 01:02:28,641
I'm Niranjan.

482
01:02:30,394 --> 01:02:31,897
Janaki's brother.

483
01:02:32,898 --> 01:02:36,028
-The other day, your bike...
-Oh, hi!

484
01:02:36,154 --> 01:02:37,740
I am Ajinkya.

485
01:02:39,576 --> 01:02:42,456
I recognized you. The other day...

486
01:02:43,374 --> 01:02:44,710
Why don't you come inside?

487
01:02:46,629 --> 01:02:48,215
I can't now. Let's meet tomorrow morning.

488
01:02:48,299 --> 01:02:49,885
I can't right now.
Let's meet tomorrow morning.

489
01:02:51,638 --> 01:02:53,391
Sure. Where?

490
01:02:53,474 --> 01:02:55,185
-In the palm grove.
-In the palm grove.

491
01:02:57,272 --> 01:03:01,779
The... palm grove? Why?

492
01:03:01,863 --> 01:03:05,285
Um... let's meet tomorrow at 8 a.m.

493
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:07,414
I'll explain things when we meet.

494
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:09,334
Janaki...

495
01:03:24,985 --> 01:03:27,781
He's here. Brief me.

496
01:03:28,156 --> 01:03:30,452
I can't brief you.

497
01:03:39,425 --> 01:03:40,886
Tell me.

498
01:03:43,432 --> 01:03:45,310
Ask him to hop in.

499
01:03:45,936 --> 01:03:47,104
Hop in.

500
01:03:48,357 --> 01:03:51,487
Why? Why have I been summoned here?

501
01:03:52,363 --> 01:03:54,826
Let's go for a drive by the lakeside.

502
01:03:55,076 --> 01:03:57,038
Let's go for a drive by the lakeside.

503
01:03:57,121 --> 01:04:01,336
Excuse me! With you?

504
01:04:12,563 --> 01:04:14,525
Let's go for a drive by the lakeside?

505
01:04:15,026 --> 01:04:16,653
I shudder to think what he thinks of me!

506
01:04:16,737 --> 01:04:19,992
You spoil everything. Idiot!

507
01:04:20,368 --> 01:04:21,912
So, take care of it yourself.

508
01:04:21,996 --> 01:04:25,042
<i>I have no intention of hanging around</i>
<i>as your driver-interpreter.</i>

509
01:04:36,979 --> 01:04:40,902
-Hey, reverse!
-Hey, reverse!

510
01:04:40,985 --> 01:04:43,072
Who do they think they are?

511
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:45,952
-They don't own the village!
-Hey, reverse!

512
01:05:34,157 --> 01:05:37,078
-Hey, Ajinkya.
-What are you doing?

513
01:05:39,207 --> 01:05:41,419
Again. Let's go again.

514
01:06:00,742 --> 01:06:02,120
Come on, dude.

515
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:20,358
Yes, Niranjan? Tell me.

516
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:24,991
Yes, we're talking. Tell me.

517
01:06:25,074 --> 01:06:27,787
Let's go for a drive.

518
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,916
By the lakeside?

519
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:37,011
Janaki wanted to convey
a few things to you.

520
01:06:45,817 --> 01:06:49,114
Okay. Let's go... on my bike.

521
01:06:51,034 --> 01:06:52,453
In my car.

522
01:06:52,662 --> 01:06:53,705
Why?

523
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:56,168
I'm afraid of bikes.
One has to hold the rider tightly.

524
01:06:56,251 --> 01:06:59,423
Oh! No, let's go by car.

525
01:07:01,176 --> 01:07:04,389
Oh my God... But let's return soon.

526
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:06,643
-Okay.
-Before dark.

527
01:07:26,259 --> 01:07:28,346
Where are you taking me?

528
01:07:29,473 --> 01:07:32,728
Hey, ask him to sit in the back.
Close to me.

529
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,698
Will you please sit in the back?

530
01:07:48,504 --> 01:07:52,427
Um... that seat has a broken leg. Please.

531
01:08:02,027 --> 01:08:04,197
What's going on?

532
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,701
Okay, now tell me.

533
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:48,437
She... waited for you.

534
01:08:54,071 --> 01:08:55,824
Until her last breath.

535
01:08:56,492 --> 01:08:58,119
Until her last breath.

536
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:03,545
You didn't see each other for six months.

537
01:09:04,296 --> 01:09:06,091
Not even in the hospital.

538
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:08,220
Why?

539
01:09:12,059 --> 01:09:13,896
You couldn't make it even once?

540
01:09:14,271 --> 01:09:15,941
What did she say?

541
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:20,031
Did she suffer a lot in the end?

542
01:09:22,076 --> 01:09:24,538
Your visit would have eased the pain.

543
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:29,713
I meant to visit her.

544
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:33,094
It was unfathomable.

545
01:09:35,097 --> 01:09:36,683
I kept procrastinating.

546
01:09:49,830 --> 01:09:53,670
I never expressed it to her in words.

547
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:59,054
Why?

548
01:09:59,805 --> 01:10:03,854
I couldn't really understand my feelings,
or her feelings.

549
01:10:12,284 --> 01:10:13,995
I was fond of her.

550
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:18,294
She sang very well.

551
01:10:19,922 --> 01:10:23,928
Every day after her class, she would come
and hang out near our dance floor.

552
01:11:03,327 --> 01:11:04,579
You were wrong.

553
01:11:08,085 --> 01:11:10,047
You should have gone to see her.

554
01:11:15,347 --> 01:11:17,350
Actually, my mom smelled a rat.

555
01:11:18,978 --> 01:11:24,028
My parents are the sort who read your
text messages when you're in the shower

556
01:11:24,779 --> 01:11:27,283
and play your pen drives when you are out.

557
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:36,465
Since you both were in love,
you should have mentioned it to me.

558
01:11:37,175 --> 01:11:38,469
To you?

559
01:11:39,804 --> 01:11:42,058
Janaki used to say that
you were dumb and heartless.

560
01:11:43,727 --> 01:11:45,981
That you knew nothing beyond making money.

561
01:11:54,036 --> 01:12:01,047
Actually, my mom said that Janaki was
a frail, sickly girl from a humble family.

562
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:02,759
"What's so attractive about her?"

563
01:12:05,388 --> 01:12:08,017
I really wanted to share my thoughts
with Janaki at least once.

564
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:12,483
We did come here once.

565
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:20,079
We just sat, and then left
without uttering a word.

566
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:24,503
She gradually started missing classes.

567
01:12:27,925 --> 01:12:30,722
One time, your Dad
brought her in a wheelchair.

568
01:12:34,353 --> 01:12:36,356
I just couldn't bring myself to see her.

569
01:12:43,034 --> 01:12:44,954
-May I smoke?
-Certainly not.

570
01:12:46,164 --> 01:12:48,042
Smoking at such a young age!

571
01:12:48,418 --> 01:12:49,753
You too, huh?

572
01:12:51,297 --> 01:12:53,635
I'm sure you scrutinize
her pen drives too.

573
01:12:55,847 --> 01:12:57,933
-Okay. You may smoke.
-No, forget it.

574
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:06,281
Who was that girl the other day?

575
01:13:10,245 --> 01:13:13,543
The other day... on the ferry.

576
01:13:13,876 --> 01:13:16,088
Who was that girl you were with?

577
01:13:18,718 --> 01:13:19,761
She is...

578
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,143
She is a...

579
01:14:49,243 --> 01:14:55,712
I need your help... with something.

580
01:14:56,463 --> 01:14:59,677
<i>I just want you to...</i>
<i>do it for my sake.</i>

581
01:15:00,929 --> 01:15:02,682
<i>Then I won't bother you.</i>

582
01:18:18,214 --> 01:18:20,676
Will this stay like this all day?

583
01:18:21,845 --> 01:18:23,431
I'll make sure it does.

584
01:18:26,436 --> 01:18:27,479
Off to church?

585
01:18:29,816 --> 01:18:30,693
Yup!

586
01:18:32,571 --> 01:18:33,865
To confess my sins.

587
01:18:57,111 --> 01:18:59,365
<i>Who is this oldish lady in a dress?</i>

588
01:18:59,699 --> 01:19:00,993
My mommy.

589
01:19:05,709 --> 01:19:10,133
Cloud, crow, mouse, Mommy...

590
01:19:10,383 --> 01:19:12,470
Is this some new style of photography?

591
01:19:13,305 --> 01:19:15,934
If I were free like you,
if I could travel

592
01:19:16,018 --> 01:19:18,939
and meet new people,
I would have taken photos of them.

593
01:19:37,553 --> 01:19:39,682
A gift from your family...

594
01:21:26,901 --> 01:21:29,030
You've messed up your hair!

595
01:21:33,203 --> 01:21:38,879
Dad, the house needs
a fresh coat of paint.

596
01:21:39,589 --> 01:21:41,425
Why don't you give us an occasion for it?

597
01:21:42,928 --> 01:21:45,599
You haven't even looked at
the photos that Mrs. Gupte sent.

598
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:48,228
You will leave in ten days...

599
01:21:48,478 --> 01:21:50,983
and then your dad and I
will be staring at painted walls.

600
01:21:54,196 --> 01:21:57,619
Hey, is it giving a good average?

601
01:21:57,702 --> 01:21:59,372
I've just met it.

602
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,128
I've just about driven it.

603
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:05,131
I'll know in a few days.

604
01:22:05,548 --> 01:22:07,677
Is the pick-up good?

605
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,515
It's superb! Great!

606
01:22:10,598 --> 01:22:14,730
You two should go on vacation.

607
01:22:14,939 --> 01:22:18,987
Go to Simla, Agra, visit the Taj Mahal.

608
01:22:19,071 --> 01:22:20,740
I'll stay here for ten days.

609
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:23,829
Don't push it too far.

610
01:22:24,246 --> 01:22:25,832
Stay here with us.

611
01:22:25,915 --> 01:22:28,211
That's all the enjoyment we need.

612
01:22:29,087 --> 01:22:32,802
Yeah, stay with one of the four
that Mrs. Gupte recommended.

613
01:22:35,056 --> 01:22:37,184
You voiced my very thoughts!

614
01:22:37,268 --> 01:22:39,313
All four are good, darling.

615
01:22:40,732 --> 01:22:42,067
All four?

616
01:22:43,027 --> 01:22:44,864
So I must consider.

617
01:22:46,533 --> 01:22:48,828
I'll be back late tonight.

618
01:22:53,586 --> 01:22:57,176
I've been watching him
for the past two days.

619
01:22:58,177 --> 01:22:59,972
His behavior seems fishy.

620
01:23:01,266 --> 01:23:02,559
Very good.

621
01:23:04,104 --> 01:23:07,401
The bitch in the van
is probably the reason behind it.

622
01:23:07,943 --> 01:23:10,281
He's incapable of such sweet talk.

623
01:23:11,157 --> 01:23:12,660
Very good.

624
01:23:19,337 --> 01:23:22,384
Are these preparations
to shift the base to Alice's?

625
01:23:26,265 --> 01:23:29,604
Don't polish off the ice cream.
Leave some for me.

626
01:23:40,539 --> 01:23:42,292
We won't get along well.

627
01:23:43,961 --> 01:23:45,464
Her family is insane.

628
01:23:45,787 --> 01:23:47,885
Her parents thwart her growth
as if she were a bonsai tree.

629
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,435
Visit her parents with a cool head.

630
01:23:54,646 --> 01:23:56,941
A lot of water has gone under the bridge.

631
01:23:57,066 --> 01:23:59,445
Smile. Be polite.

632
01:24:00,155 --> 01:24:01,783
Eat the cake or whatever they offer.

633
01:24:03,869 --> 01:24:05,247
Appreciate it.

634
01:24:09,671 --> 01:24:15,430
Otherwise, just keep in mind
the four women Mrs. Gupte recommended.

635
01:24:15,806 --> 01:24:17,600
Mom's not gonna spare you.

636
01:24:23,235 --> 01:24:27,492
Your sole job here
is to make my life difficult.

637
01:24:27,826 --> 01:24:30,121
Okay, I'll leave then. Bye!

638
01:24:30,205 --> 01:24:34,086
Shut up! Sit down. Sit...

639
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:18,384
You were in school with Alice, right?

640
01:26:18,467 --> 01:26:20,053
-Classmate?
-Yes.

641
01:26:20,220 --> 01:26:22,140
Which one of these?

642
01:26:24,936 --> 01:26:26,731
-This one.
-Oh, nice.

643
01:26:30,696 --> 01:26:32,449
So, where were you all these years?

644
01:26:32,532 --> 01:26:33,576
Dubai.

645
01:26:39,043 --> 01:26:41,213
So, are you doing business in Dubai?

646
01:26:41,631 --> 01:26:45,554
No, I'm a sales consultant for Algware.
A silk export company.

647
01:26:51,021 --> 01:26:54,610
Gold, saffron, girls, tiger skins.

648
01:26:54,861 --> 01:26:59,160
No, it's nothing like that.
It's a proper legal export company.

649
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:05,211
So you bring home a monthly salary, right?

650
01:27:09,927 --> 01:27:14,018
By the way, Alice and I...

651
01:27:15,144 --> 01:27:17,189
-I mean...
-She told me.

652
01:27:20,612 --> 01:27:24,994
You see, we are a very liberal family.
Our type of people.

653
01:27:25,328 --> 01:27:27,123
-How so?
-Listen to me.

654
01:27:27,999 --> 01:27:33,007
We have no issues with caste
or love marriages.

655
01:27:33,299 --> 01:27:35,845
-Ours is a love marriage too.
-Really?

656
01:27:36,597 --> 01:27:42,231
Alice's Mommy, tell him how we met.

657
01:27:42,314 --> 01:27:45,987
-Rubbish. Let's not.
-Go on, tell him.

658
01:27:46,404 --> 01:27:48,616
-Please, let's not.
-Go on.

659
01:27:52,122 --> 01:27:55,503
I'm from the state of Maharashtra.
From the city of Amravati.

660
01:27:55,879 --> 01:28:00,511
I murdered my younger brother
and ended up in jail.

661
01:28:00,845 --> 01:28:04,017
I met him there,
through a cultural program.

662
01:28:05,436 --> 01:28:07,857
Got it? Our type of people.

663
01:28:10,361 --> 01:28:12,615
Tell me, how much salary do you get?

664
01:28:14,117 --> 01:28:15,578
Your dad owns a garage, right?

665
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:20,294
He used to be a mechanic.
And this guy used to be a paperboy.

666
01:28:20,711 --> 01:28:24,134
Get lost or I'll slap you!

667
01:28:24,551 --> 01:28:25,594
I know.

668
01:28:26,387 --> 01:28:30,686
Do you have any idea how much money
it takes to maintain Alice?

669
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:38,240
Hey, sit down.

670
01:28:44,334 --> 01:28:50,052
My son, just go and marry
a doctor or engineer's daughter.

671
01:28:51,304 --> 01:28:53,140
We wouldn't get along.

672
01:28:54,350 --> 01:28:56,312
You've been beaten once before.

673
01:28:57,188 --> 01:28:59,609
Do you wish to do it again, my boy?

674
01:29:03,950 --> 01:29:07,831
Please, come inside for a minute.

675
01:29:12,798 --> 01:29:14,550
Hey, sit down.

676
01:29:20,686 --> 01:29:23,190
Listen, Alice has now crossed thirty-five.

677
01:29:23,315 --> 01:29:25,986
Please change your attitude, Mr. Andrew.

678
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:29,116
Oh! He's a Marathi boy,
so you have a soft spot for him, Ansuya.

679
01:29:29,241 --> 01:29:31,078
He's going to get a thrashing from me.

680
01:29:31,161 --> 01:29:33,039
Alice is in love with him.

681
01:29:33,123 --> 01:29:36,170
I know. It's that silly
Romeo-Juliet puppy love.

682
01:29:36,545 --> 01:29:39,341
My daughter's not a burden.
I can take care of her.

683
01:29:39,425 --> 01:29:41,679
This roadside chap can't take care of her
to save his life.

684
01:29:41,762 --> 01:29:43,223
He doesn't even carry a gun.

685
01:29:43,473 --> 01:29:46,770
The gun can be part of her dowry.

686
01:29:46,854 --> 01:29:50,568
And let's let him handle
our movie piracy business in Dubai.

687
01:29:50,944 --> 01:29:52,572
He'll learn gradually.

688
01:30:00,209 --> 01:30:02,171
But this was the second time, Alice.

689
01:30:05,593 --> 01:30:07,930
Enough insults. Not anymore.

690
01:30:11,687 --> 01:30:14,775
Don't judge me based on my parents.

691
01:30:24,583 --> 01:30:25,877
I'm happy to be single.

692
01:30:30,426 --> 01:30:31,970
Let's forget it.

693
01:30:33,014 --> 01:30:36,561
Forget it?
I waited for you all these years.

694
01:30:37,563 --> 01:30:40,109
Last year, you didn't reply to my emails.

695
01:30:40,234 --> 01:30:42,029
I thought you gotten married.

696
01:30:42,822 --> 01:30:45,159
I consoled and convinced myself.

697
01:30:48,581 --> 01:30:54,299
Narinjan, I want to live freely, like you.

698
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:57,137
Let me elope with you to Dubai.

699
01:31:01,144 --> 01:31:03,063
-That's not possible.
-Why?

700
01:31:03,356 --> 01:31:04,858
I won't leave this village.

701
01:31:05,275 --> 01:31:07,362
You said you would leave in ten days.

702
01:31:07,654 --> 01:31:10,284
No, I will not. I have to be here.

703
01:31:11,118 --> 01:31:12,204
But why?

704
01:31:12,579 --> 01:31:13,790
I can't answer that.

705
01:31:14,290 --> 01:31:16,753
If you want me...

706
01:31:17,003 --> 01:31:20,259
you will have to stay in this village,
in my house, with all of us.

707
01:31:20,634 --> 01:31:22,137
Me, my parents, my sister.

708
01:31:22,471 --> 01:31:24,557
That's not possible while Papa is around.

709
01:31:24,641 --> 01:31:26,686
And you don't have
the guts to convince him.

710
01:31:30,442 --> 01:31:31,945
Do one thing.

711
01:31:34,324 --> 01:31:36,327
Pack your bags and come over.

712
01:31:44,340 --> 01:31:45,801
Yesterday, I was at your house for ages.

713
01:31:45,884 --> 01:31:47,888
Couldn't you look
your dad in the eyes and say

714
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:52,437
"This guy is my friend. Don't insult him"?

715
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,432
What parents...

716
01:32:15,809 --> 01:32:17,437
What a house...

717
01:32:21,276 --> 01:32:23,280
Let her do whatever she wants.

718
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:31,293
Niranjan?

719
01:32:33,463 --> 01:32:35,174
Elope with Alice...

720
01:32:37,678 --> 01:32:38,972
to Dubai.

721
01:32:42,353 --> 01:32:43,772
What about you?

722
01:32:44,982 --> 01:32:46,401
What about me?

723
01:32:48,071 --> 01:32:49,239
That's not the point.

724
01:32:49,615 --> 01:32:52,161
It is.

725
01:32:53,955 --> 01:32:57,712
You stopped me from going back,
and now you want me to leave?

726
01:33:00,091 --> 01:33:04,807
I told Alice to run away
from her dad's house

727
01:33:04,974 --> 01:33:06,393
and live with us, if she loves me.

728
01:33:09,648 --> 01:33:11,025
Have you gone mad?

729
01:33:12,653 --> 01:33:14,698
She can never take the first step out.

730
01:33:16,534 --> 01:33:18,997
She's afraid of her father.

731
01:33:23,170 --> 01:33:24,798
Our situation is different.

732
01:33:25,675 --> 01:33:28,304
We are free to go out, chill, gallivant.

733
01:33:32,352 --> 01:33:35,274
You have me. She has no one.

734
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:39,322
She needs you.

735
01:33:42,953 --> 01:33:45,374
She waited for you all these years. Right?

736
01:33:58,521 --> 01:34:00,566
You need a life-long companion.

737
01:34:03,112 --> 01:34:04,364
A female friend.

738
01:34:06,868 --> 01:34:08,203
Forever.

739
01:34:09,622 --> 01:34:10,624
That's you.

740
01:34:14,046 --> 01:34:16,592
Don't be silly.

741
01:34:18,637 --> 01:34:20,432
What's so silly?

742
01:34:21,434 --> 01:34:24,480
I am concerned about my family, about you.

743
01:34:25,232 --> 01:34:26,984
I want to stay here.

744
01:34:28,195 --> 01:34:30,449
I never feel lonely thanks to you.

745
01:34:30,532 --> 01:34:31,742
That's more than enough.

746
01:34:33,453 --> 01:34:37,502
Just because I hang out with you,
chat, roam around, and drink with you

747
01:34:37,585 --> 01:34:39,088
it doesn't mean I am your friend.

748
01:34:42,928 --> 01:34:46,559
It's not me, it's Alice.

749
01:34:49,563 --> 01:34:51,191
You love each other.

750
01:34:52,610 --> 01:34:54,321
Don't be in denial.

751
01:34:56,951 --> 01:34:58,996
I will not part with you.

752
01:35:01,083 --> 01:35:02,335
But I will.

753
01:35:02,418 --> 01:35:03,628
Janaki, please.

754
01:35:03,712 --> 01:35:05,214
You let me down.

755
01:35:07,593 --> 01:35:10,139
I didn't just intend to change
your attire. You get it?

756
01:35:13,687 --> 01:35:15,899
I wish you understood me.

757
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:24,329
What sort of love is this?

758
01:35:24,872 --> 01:35:26,625
You shrug people off
the minute they ask for help.

759
01:35:26,708 --> 01:35:29,338
That's what you would do
if it were any other girl but Alice.

760
01:35:30,172 --> 01:35:32,009
Your problem is...

761
01:35:33,511 --> 01:35:35,807
that you are incapable of loving anyone.

762
01:36:09,571 --> 01:36:15,790
<i>The sky wells up</i>

763
01:36:16,249 --> 01:36:20,965
<i>With emotion and darkens</i>

764
01:36:22,426 --> 01:36:28,895
<i>The edges of the clouds</i>

765
01:36:29,395 --> 01:36:34,738
<i>Overflow out of season</i>

766
01:36:35,572 --> 01:36:41,916
<i>But don't fall in love with the rain</i>

767
01:36:42,125 --> 01:36:47,801
<i>For it is only a passing visitor</i>

768
01:36:48,970 --> 01:36:55,188
<i>It sprouts a pair of wings and flies away</i>

769
01:36:55,355 --> 01:37:01,282
<i>So that it may flower once again</i>

770
01:37:01,991 --> 01:37:08,043
<i>After drenching your mind</i>

771
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:14,595
<i>The clouds move on</i>

772
01:38:22,416 --> 01:38:28,718
<i>The wave turns back to the coast</i>

773
01:38:28,802 --> 01:38:34,645
<i>And the footprints in the sand</i>
<i>Fill up with water</i>

774
01:38:35,563 --> 01:38:41,865
<i>Just as the words inscribed on the beach</i>
<i>Are permanently lost</i>

775
01:38:41,948 --> 01:38:47,916
<i>Relationships change forever</i>

776
01:38:48,543 --> 01:38:55,053
<i>I keep a part</i>

777
01:38:55,137 --> 01:39:01,439
<i>Of myself behind</i>

778
01:39:01,522 --> 01:39:08,117
<i>And become a mother before I leave</i>

779
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:14,001
<i>To cover you all</i>
<i>With the warmth of my love</i>

780
01:39:14,711 --> 01:39:20,763
<i>After drenching your mind</i>

781
01:39:21,055 --> 01:39:26,021
<i>The clouds move on...</i>

782
01:40:23,366 --> 01:40:25,662
Where were you?

783
01:40:25,829 --> 01:40:27,456
I was just kidding.

784
01:40:27,999 --> 01:40:30,002
-And getting you used to the fact...
-Why?

785
01:40:30,086 --> 01:40:33,091
that I won't be around forever.

786
01:40:34,384 --> 01:40:36,054
Rubbish!

787
01:40:42,732 --> 01:40:49,660
Come on, get dressed,
look good, and go to church.

788
01:40:51,788 --> 01:40:52,957
And do what?

789
01:40:54,084 --> 01:40:55,336
Talk to her.

790
01:40:56,588 --> 01:40:59,426
Everything has been said.

791
01:41:00,302 --> 01:41:03,474
I'm telling you, trust me.

792
01:41:05,394 --> 01:41:07,064
Please, go. For my sake.

793
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:10,027
-Janaki... Hey, you--
-Or else I'm leaving.

794
01:41:16,037 --> 01:41:17,205
Okay.

795
01:41:47,965 --> 01:41:50,135
Let's forget the past.

796
01:41:52,263 --> 01:41:53,140
Repeat it.

797
01:41:53,223 --> 01:41:55,227
Let's forget the past.

798
01:41:57,397 --> 01:41:59,066
Let's start afresh.

799
01:41:59,567 --> 01:42:01,445
Let's start afresh.

800
01:42:07,247 --> 01:42:10,460
The situation is not as bad as it seems.

801
01:42:11,295 --> 01:42:14,216
The situation is not as bad as it seems.

802
01:42:15,176 --> 01:42:17,305
Let's look for a mid-way together.

803
01:42:17,597 --> 01:42:19,600
Let's look for a mid-way together.

804
01:42:21,395 --> 01:42:23,106
I would have to leave my family.

805
01:42:23,190 --> 01:42:25,569
And you and I would
have to leave this village.

806
01:42:26,111 --> 01:42:29,116
-Yes. I agree.
-Anything but that.

807
01:42:29,492 --> 01:42:31,745
I have already made myself clear.
I will not leave my family.

808
01:42:31,829 --> 01:42:33,123
Idiot!

809
01:42:33,206 --> 01:42:35,710
Then why did you come back to see me?

810
01:42:38,465 --> 01:42:40,802
No one can ever love you.

811
01:42:41,011 --> 01:42:44,809
And if any girl does, you will torture her

812
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:47,855
to such an extent that she will
never give you a second glance.

813
01:42:51,486 --> 01:42:53,198
Go away.

814
01:42:53,573 --> 01:42:57,705
-Hey!
-Chumbak, stop! Niranjan!

815
01:42:57,789 --> 01:43:00,293
Oh my God...

816
01:43:16,945 --> 01:43:19,074
Oh my God...

817
01:43:19,658 --> 01:43:22,538
Chumbak! Get up!

818
01:43:22,913 --> 01:43:26,002
-Chumbak...
-Is he dead?

819
01:43:26,461 --> 01:43:29,216
-Niranjan, get some water.
-Chumbak!

820
01:43:29,549 --> 01:43:31,720
-Niranjan, get some water, please.
-Niranjan.

821
01:43:31,928 --> 01:43:38,940
-My God! Chumbak! Niranjan, get the water.
-Put her in the van. Let's run away.

822
01:43:39,107 --> 01:43:41,486
-Alice, come on. Get up.
-What are you doing? Wait.

823
01:43:41,569 --> 01:43:44,240
He is there. Niranjan. Wait!

824
01:43:44,491 --> 01:43:47,454
-Niranjan, what are you doing?
-Get in.

825
01:44:58,655 --> 01:45:00,074
Now what?

826
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:02,286
<i>Now what?</i>
<i>Now the shot has been fired!</i>

827
01:45:02,370 --> 01:45:04,206
I won't go back home now.

828
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:06,836
At worst,
they will charge you with murder.

829
01:45:06,919 --> 01:45:09,507
Don't worry. I shall charge them
with criminal intimidation.

830
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:14,473
And if that doesn't work,
I will charge Chumbak with rape

831
01:45:14,598 --> 01:45:16,936
and he can spend twenty years
fighting the case.

832
01:45:17,353 --> 01:45:19,315
She's wonderful!

833
01:45:19,398 --> 01:45:20,859
It's all because of you!

834
01:45:20,942 --> 01:45:23,154
Thanks to me!

835
01:45:23,238 --> 01:45:26,368
Otherwise, I would be lamenting
in that church for the next two years

836
01:45:26,451 --> 01:45:28,204
and you would be arguing non-stop.

837
01:45:51,743 --> 01:45:53,496
What next?

838
01:45:53,580 --> 01:45:57,586
I think we need to hide somewhere
for a couple of days.

839
01:45:59,214 --> 01:46:00,383
In my house.

840
01:46:06,810 --> 01:46:10,983
Drive out of the village and turn right.

841
01:46:11,067 --> 01:46:14,030
There's a den at the foot of the mountain.

842
01:46:43,704 --> 01:46:46,167
-This land belongs to us.
-To you?

843
01:46:46,751 --> 01:46:50,507
When Papa was a smuggler,
all the goods were hidden here.

844
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:03,362
Are you sure Chumbak is fine?

845
01:47:03,779 --> 01:47:06,492
I just pushed him.

846
01:47:06,576 --> 01:47:11,083
Relax. He must be fine.

847
01:47:11,166 --> 01:47:14,505
All is fair in love and family.

848
01:47:37,084 --> 01:47:38,629
What's the matter?

849
01:47:47,602 --> 01:47:48,896
This is the beginning.

850
01:47:51,650 --> 01:47:54,697
This is the first time
you've rescued me from home.

851
01:47:58,370 --> 01:48:00,373
I will never ditch you.

852
01:48:27,877 --> 01:48:33,887
<i>The stars lingered on</i>

853
01:48:34,221 --> 01:48:41,316
<i>For the first time, near you</i>

854
01:48:42,651 --> 01:48:48,745
<i>Eyes were misty</i>

855
01:48:49,037 --> 01:48:56,174
<i>For the first time, for you</i>

856
01:48:57,509 --> 01:49:04,813
<i>Old sorrow has returned anew</i>

857
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:12,158
<i>The sky is dressed in many a hue</i>

858
01:49:12,451 --> 01:49:18,711
<i>Tell me why, it is a new me</i>

859
01:49:19,671 --> 01:49:25,890
<i>What is it that binds me</i>
<i>So strongly to thee?</i>

860
01:49:27,100 --> 01:49:33,527
<i>Tell me why all paths end here</i>

861
01:49:34,445 --> 01:49:41,749
<i>You are an oasis, may I rest here</i>

862
01:49:46,507 --> 01:49:49,804
Enough, stop it now!

863
01:49:50,347 --> 01:49:54,186
He might have gone somewhere for work.

864
01:49:55,272 --> 01:49:59,236
Without telling us?
At least tell us.

865
01:50:01,323 --> 01:50:02,742
Do you think he's gone to Dubai without--

866
01:50:02,826 --> 01:50:05,914
-What are you watching? Knock it off.
-How will he go to Dubai?

867
01:50:06,373 --> 01:50:08,877
-Oh my God!
-Open the door.

868
01:50:09,086 --> 01:50:11,006
Who is it?

869
01:50:13,844 --> 01:50:21,106
<i>Tell me why time is humming in our ear</i>

870
01:50:21,189 --> 01:50:28,410
<i>Moments are dripping from it,</i>
<i>Can you hear them?</i>

871
01:50:28,535 --> 01:50:35,588
<i>Teary eyes reflect twinkling dreams, why?</i>

872
01:50:36,047 --> 01:50:39,637
<i>In the hollows of my palms</i>

873
01:50:39,804 --> 01:50:43,768
<i>Let's collect the melting sky</i>

874
01:50:44,186 --> 01:50:51,490
<i>This hand enjoys the showers of joy</i>

875
01:50:51,782 --> 01:50:59,044
<i>Eyelids float away lightly, why?</i>

876
01:50:59,127 --> 01:51:05,888
<i>Tell me why, it is a new me</i>

877
01:51:06,473 --> 01:51:12,817
<i>What is it that binds me</i>
<i>So strongly to thee?</i>

878
01:51:13,902 --> 01:51:20,872
<i>Tell me why all paths end here</i>

879
01:51:21,414 --> 01:51:28,718
<i>You are an oasis, may I rest here</i>

880
01:51:36,147 --> 01:51:37,983
Please, help yourself.

881
01:51:38,067 --> 01:51:39,611
Sure.

882
01:51:39,694 --> 01:51:40,946
That's enough.

883
01:51:41,155 --> 01:51:43,367
My mother would make <i>pohay </i>like this.

884
01:51:43,451 --> 01:51:45,579
I'm missing my childhood home.

885
01:51:45,663 --> 01:51:48,209
Do you order the <i>papads </i>from Pen?

886
01:51:48,292 --> 01:51:50,379
Get some for me too.

887
01:51:50,754 --> 01:51:52,966
Our children... are they fine?

888
01:51:53,676 --> 01:51:57,015
Of course. They will figure it out.

889
01:51:58,100 --> 01:52:01,898
Niranjan turned out to be quite a stud.

890
01:52:01,981 --> 01:52:05,153
Dear old Andrew is like a punctured tire.

891
01:52:05,237 --> 01:52:08,951
How skillfully he rescued
our girl in broad daylight.

892
01:52:09,869 --> 01:52:13,333
He thought he was the local crime lord.

893
01:52:16,380 --> 01:52:19,302
He has a soft spot for his girl, you know.

894
01:52:19,719 --> 01:52:22,307
Now he's weeping quietly at home,
knocking back the alcohol.

895
01:52:23,016 --> 01:52:25,645
I wonder what that rascal is up to.

896
01:52:26,146 --> 01:52:28,400
I always smelled a rat, you know.

897
01:52:28,650 --> 01:52:32,991
Every night, they would chat in our van.

898
01:52:33,867 --> 01:52:36,622
That's why he had it painted.

899
01:52:36,872 --> 01:52:39,961
I can't even imagine the other deeds.

900
01:52:40,211 --> 01:52:42,465
Really! Anyway...

901
01:52:43,049 --> 01:52:47,390
It was our dream that Alice would have
a destination wedding.

902
01:52:47,473 --> 01:52:50,687
Perhaps Fiji or Mauritius.

903
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:53,233
-Shall we do it?
-No, thanks.

904
01:52:53,650 --> 01:52:55,862
Let's just do it in our front yard.

905
01:52:56,321 --> 01:52:58,074
Besides, we don't have passports.

906
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:00,161
That's no big deal.

907
01:53:00,954 --> 01:53:01,997
Wait!

908
01:53:07,047 --> 01:53:10,470
Are there any spare passports at home?

909
01:53:10,553 --> 01:53:11,805
Yes. Four.

910
01:53:11,889 --> 01:53:17,398
Get photos of this uncle and auntie
and give them their passports today.

911
01:53:17,899 --> 01:53:21,029
Don't mention a word to Mr. Andrew.

912
01:53:21,238 --> 01:53:25,119
Let's hide Alice here
until her wedding day.

913
01:53:25,995 --> 01:53:28,792
Ask Inspector Nimbalkar to come see me.

914
01:53:29,334 --> 01:53:30,879
Yes, of course.

915
01:53:31,129 --> 01:53:33,800
Auntie, can I have more <i>pohay</i>?

916
01:53:34,510 --> 01:53:36,221
Let him have some.

917
01:53:40,519 --> 01:53:44,067
How about this? Let's not buy a house.

918
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:49,242
Let's just dump our stuff in the caravan
and keep roaming around.

919
01:53:49,534 --> 01:53:53,791
Whenever we're hungry, we will eat,
and whenever night falls, we will sleep.

920
01:53:54,251 --> 01:53:56,504
No, we need a house.

921
01:53:56,755 --> 01:54:02,890
Two tough dogs, a front yard,
and our folks. It's a must.

922
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:06,479
Alright, but we meet them
and return within two months.

923
01:54:06,563 --> 01:54:09,275
I want to travel the world with you.

924
01:54:17,873 --> 01:54:19,668
Hey, what happened?

925
01:54:21,087 --> 01:54:22,631
Why did you honk?

926
01:54:23,006 --> 01:54:24,926
It wasn't me!

927
01:54:25,010 --> 01:54:27,556
You hallucinated.

928
01:54:28,223 --> 01:54:29,517
Where's Alice?

929
01:54:29,642 --> 01:54:31,061
She's over there.

930
01:54:32,021 --> 01:54:34,066
Have you lost it?

931
01:54:34,526 --> 01:54:35,819
Go and be with her.

932
01:54:38,532 --> 01:54:40,995
How could you leave her alone?

933
01:54:41,120 --> 01:54:42,831
Go!

934
01:54:46,253 --> 01:54:47,422
Go!

935
01:55:56,954 --> 01:55:58,581
Isn't it chilly?

936
01:55:59,833 --> 01:56:01,378
Let's have some beer.

937
01:56:02,129 --> 01:56:04,049
At this hour?

938
01:56:19,074 --> 01:56:22,705
Let's invite Ajinkya to my wedding.

939
01:56:24,499 --> 01:56:26,085
Who? The smoker?

940
01:56:27,296 --> 01:56:32,638
No, the rude guy who keeps
stumbling on his bike.

941
01:56:38,940 --> 01:56:41,444
If you have a daughter,
make sure you teach her to dance.

942
01:56:47,120 --> 01:56:49,290
And just grant her
the pocket money she wants.

943
01:56:51,002 --> 01:56:51,961
Alright.

944
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:58,264
Don't scold her for long internet bills.

945
01:57:01,185 --> 01:57:02,395
I won't.

946
01:57:05,108 --> 01:57:08,864
Don't scrutinize her cell phone,
text messages, and computer.

947
01:57:11,243 --> 01:57:12,370
Okay.

948
01:57:16,794 --> 01:57:19,966
Let her boyfriend smoke if he wants to.

949
01:57:22,345 --> 01:57:24,474
-No way!
-Yes.

950
01:57:24,557 --> 01:57:25,559
No.

951
01:57:26,435 --> 01:57:27,520
Yes.

952
01:57:27,771 --> 01:57:28,814
No.

953
01:59:16,618 --> 01:59:20,332
We hardly met while I was alive.

954
01:59:25,007 --> 01:59:29,180
People just exist and
then suddenly vanish one day.

955
01:59:29,639 --> 01:59:31,142
They disappear.

956
02:00:37,794 --> 02:00:38,837
What's the matter?

957
02:00:44,221 --> 02:00:45,557
Tell me.

958
02:00:53,278 --> 02:00:55,531
I am here for you.

959
02:00:58,703 --> 02:01:00,206
Calm down.

960
02:01:01,082 --> 02:01:02,251
Calm down.

961
02:01:20,281 --> 02:01:21,783
Let's go back.

962
02:01:28,795 --> 02:01:32,718
Yes, let's go to my house.

963
02:04:07,558 --> 02:04:09,519
<i>Hey, come on.</i>

964
02:04:09,811 --> 02:04:11,898
Yes! Good one. Good one.

965
02:04:12,983 --> 02:04:15,070
-Goal!
-Come on!

966
02:04:15,321 --> 02:04:17,658
-Nice, nice.
-Come on.

967
02:04:27,674 --> 02:04:29,219
Come on!

968
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,293
Hello, Niranjan. Its a Girl
