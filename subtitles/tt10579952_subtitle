1
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,680
Mother?

2
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,140
Appa...!

3
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,826
'Let's kill this boy also brother-in-law

4
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,890
If we burn all the evidence
we will be the prime suspects

5
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,140
'We need a witness
to speak in our favor'

6
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,600
All that is fine

7
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,140
Just like his father what if he also
makes trouble insisting on being truthful?

8
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,980
Let's find out right away

9
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,390
Hey boy What's your name?

10
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:48,430
- Bhavani - Huh?

11
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,430
Bhavani

12
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,980
How did your parents die?

13
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,060
They were burnt to death
in a gas explosion

14
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,640
[loud laughter]

15
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,770
He sure knows to survive I say

16
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,480
After we use him as a witness

17
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,230
...let us complain against him
for stealing our union funds

18
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,810
'His father is Lorry Union leader'

19
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,560
If we claim his son stole union cash
will anyone believe that story?

20
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Sudden show of mercy huh?

21
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,560
He's so young that's why

22
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,560
Hey boy listen

23
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,430
I'll send you to a place where boys
like you are well looked after

24
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,430
Will you go there?

25
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,480
'Govt Juvenile Observation Home
Warangal'

26
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,480
'That boy shouldn't sleep
for even one night in peace'

27
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,480
I've given you more than
what you asked

28
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,640
Thank you brother

29
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:39,980
If there's any kind of foul play
brother-in-law will kill you

30
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,560
- Keep an eye
- I'll take care bro

31
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,670
'Hey! get up'...get up...

32
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,150
What are you looking at? Wipe it

33
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,310
Wipe my boots

34
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,310
I'll kill you rascal

35
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,520
'All of you go out'

36
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:32,650
Stinking scumbag!
I'm thrashing you

37
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,950
You're standing without any reaction!

38
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,370
You are hitting me
because someone is paying you

39
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,930
I have to pay you more than him
to prevent you from hitting me

40
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:43,470
I am penniless
Hit me as much as you want

41
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,310
When I have the money

42
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:48,130
I'll call you then

43
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,170
- Who is this?
- 'Brother'

44
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,410
'That boy Bhavani has
escaped from jail'

45
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,970
Scumbag! Is this why
I'm spending so lavishly?

46
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,910
I'll deal with this in the morning
Find him before daybreak

47
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,530
I won't harm you
'Don't worry brother'

48
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:34,230
'If I had wanted to kill you, I would have
easily slit your neck when you were asleep'

49
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,090
But I can't be smitten with fright
and hide throughout my life

50
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:39,610
I came here to request you
to spare me.

51
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,210
I don't understand

52
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,090
Let me live brother

53
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,150
What do I gain by releasing you huh?

54
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,590
Leave me alone for only this week

55
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,790
I'll give you half of
what I earn this week

56
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,690
'Whichever week I don't pay you'

57
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,626
...stab me on that same day
at that same spot

58
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:58,470
You say so? Okay go

59
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,810
This week is yours go

60
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,290
How much do they pay to cross the
check post without a permit bro?

61
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,810
Without giving Rs 1000 per lorry
you won't be allowed to pass

62
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,850
I'll give the permit

63
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,490
Keep the 1000 rupees

64
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,930
I want Rs 100 per lorry

65
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,690
If the policemen hassle us?

66
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,470
I will take care of that

67
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,010
What man? What do you want?

68
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,190
'2002-2003 Register'

69
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,590
Go... go

70
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,790
Go... go

71
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:18,110
If anyone wants permit, they must
give me 500 Rupees per lorry

72
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,970
Got it?

73
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,910
'Catch'

74
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,970
Whether I'm here or not

75
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,350
...ensure that the boys get
their share of booze and fag

76
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,770
'Govt Reformatory'

77
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,190
In a way we are the
cause of all this brother

78
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,570
When we killed his father
we should have killed him too

79
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,770
Now he has the gall to contest as head
in the Lorry Drivers' Union Election

80
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:35,990
How did he amass
this much wealth bro?

81
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,050
Nagu do you know how many
lorries he has under his control?

82
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,850
Not only that, he owns a meat factory

83
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,510
He is into exports too

84
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:48,370
All this is common news partner

85
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,870
He does something with the boys in
reformatory for juvenile delinquents

86
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,950
That's why, a lot of money flows in

87
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:56,690
Some even say he plays
proxy to a minister

88
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,570
If only he wins in this
year's Union election

89
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,910
...he will stoop to any level
to avenge his father's murder

90
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:07,650
We shouldn't spare him
anymore partner

91
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,366
He's coming on his own

92
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,390
Finish him here.

93
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,010
Hey bro!

94
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,130
You are sporting all the medals of
Hindu Muslim and Christian Gods?

95
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:52,950
If you pray to all the Gods, one or
the other will save you in danger.

96
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,230
Minimum guarantee?

97
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,730
Proverbs?

98
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,950
Is this the same chap who pleaded
when he was 17 to spare his life?

99
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,330
We need to discuss something
important with you

100
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,650
You've been paying us
on a weekly basis all these years

101
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,770
Drop it

102
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,970
Instead you can sell all your assets

103
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,850
'Go, make a living somewhere else'

104
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,810
I wanted to tell you
exactly this at the earliest

105
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,470
Week after week, all these days

106
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,610
I was paying you to save my life

107
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,330
That's why I've decided
to stop payment

108
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:27,390
That decision isn't yours to take

109
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:29,350
'Just zip your lips
and obey our orders'

110
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,130
I will do only what I feel is right

111
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,530
Hey... Hey... Hey...

112
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,890
I know what all you are doing....

113
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,950
Making those boys surrender
for the crimes you commit

114
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,370
'Instigating them to kill
We know about all your offenses'

115
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:45,590
Don't show off your temerity or
else I will build your grave right here

116
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,710
Turn your head and look around.
This is my joint, if I think something...

117
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,030
Only the lorry will leave from here.
You won't

118
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:59,570
You don't know the difference between
slogging for money or gratitude.

119
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,390
O ho...

120
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:02,110
You want me to show you a sample?

121
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,510
Brothers! There is an important here.
Come over!

122
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,110
Come on

123
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,330
It's Bhavani

124
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,990
This gift of money is for anyone
who kills these 3 big men right here

125
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,990
2 million

126
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:31,110
[burst of amused laughter]

127
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,466
Whom do you think you are talking to?

128
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,110
Do you think brother is for money?
You know how many years I'm with him

129
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,050
3 million

130
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,870
If you give 3 million?
He is our brother!

131
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,350
4 million

132
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,610
Why are you keeping quiet
when he's so arrogant bro?

133
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:43,630
You just say one word, I'll kill...

134
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:44,690
5 million!

135
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,650
- How dare you rattle off?
- 6 million

136
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,030
Hey! Kill him now

137
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,450
Wait... let us hear our brother out!!

138
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:54,610
7 million

139
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:56,470
Wait... wait bro

140
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,350
I'll go up to the gate and make sure
no one enters this area

141
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,330
8 million

142
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:01,970
8 million? Move aside

143
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,690
Then shall we lock
the deal for 8 million?

144
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:10,506
We'll split 8 million equally
I'll deal with these three

145
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,110
We will take care of their case brother

146
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,210
Have you now understood the
difference between money and gratitude?

147
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,610
Forget all this.

148
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:32,430
I'll give you 2 minutes

149
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:34,130
Kill me if you can

150
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:37,150
And save yourself

151
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,140
Hey!

152
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,880
These boys?

153
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,100
Yes sir

154
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,980
Post mortem matches the crime scene?

155
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,820
They have done a neat job sir

156
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,720
Not knowing to drive
they ran over a man

157
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Who? Them?

158
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,000
'Hey! For whom are you surrendering?

159
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,500
Sir I'm not a professional driver

160
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,940
I thought I'll try my hand
But turned out fatal

161
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,340
- Right?
- Yes

162
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,800
- 'Do they have a past history?'
- Yes sir

163
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,320
Pickpocket case 511

164
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,960
Then 6 months they were in
a juvenile delinquent reformatory

165
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,520
Now they are in IPC 302

166
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,760
Is this observation home?

167
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,060
Or a criminal training center?

168
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,480
Why do you need this reformatory
that turns a thief into a murderer?

169
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,200
- Call the Observation home staff
- Okay sir

170
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:12,600
Sir he's calling you

171
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,780
Good afternoon sir
I am the superintendent here

172
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,660
Forget the introduction when do you
intend employing a regular master?

173
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,920
The boys drive away
any master we appoint

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,560
Actually scared of them
no master wants to take up this post

175
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,940
But how without a master?

176
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
'Not one master so far huh?'

177
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:31,480
How shameful?

178
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,440
If there's no master to teach
or guide the students

179
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,060
'...how will they reform huh?'

180
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,100
'I have personally seen
30-40 cases like this here'

181
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,880
'Superintendent I'm passing
a Govt order'

182
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:47,440
'Send it to all private Govt schools
and colleges to every single institution'

183
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,816
Can't we find at least one master!

184
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,940
Understood?

185
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Type out the order

186
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,060
"They call me master
Decisions are faster"

187
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,160
"Unlimited power...
Who is the master?"

188
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:16,320
A very renowned college.
Those who have studied in this college

189
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,560
'In cinema politics advertising and
business in their own might'

190
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,100
This college has molded
innumerable VIPs

191
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,040
'Students are very eager to make this
a very memorable reunion'

192
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,020
Do you want to know why?
Come along with me

193
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,560
Hi... Yes Ramya

194
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,340
- Hi nice to meet you
- Same here

195
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,860
I've spoken to you over the phone

196
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,660
- Oh! That was you?
- Yeah

197
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,620
What's your full name?

198
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,620
Charulatha Pooserla

199
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,220
Nice. Come let me
introduce you to everyone

200
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,540
- This college has a decorum
- Students are capable of doing it

201
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,840
Their plan is to ruin our image when
the minister arrives as our chief guest

202
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,636
'If this issue leaks
your college reputation is at stake'

203
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,460
Sit down. If you want
to take further action

204
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,300
Do so after the minister leaves

205
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,716
In this cat and mouse game,
explain things as they happened.

206
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:06,900
- Better confess truth, it's JD, right?
- Trust me sir

207
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,200
So? Who is that? Your father?

208
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,240
Sir, You all know
what happened to Savitha.

209
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,376
What shall we do with the two rascals
who sexually harassed her?

210
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,880
Hey! Hey! Mind your words!
Spit the gum first

211
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,520
I say, throw it out

212
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,756
Sir, the sweetness isnt gone yet.
I will spit it on the way out.

213
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,020
I said throw it out

214
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
Sir, you suspended for one week
two guys who sexually harassed her

215
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,536
Because that wasn't enough,
we gave a police complaint

216
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,380
These people made us run around
without taking any action.

217
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:33,920
Why? Just because Adi's father
is a big business man

218
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,460
They are planning to send
them to Canada.

219
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,600
I took my people to their house
to demand justice

220
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:44,320
Hello sir.
They have not left home

221
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,260
Looks like they are still inside
but planned something perfectly.

222
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,260
New people are visiting
the place frequently.

223
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,300
Watch out! They seem to
be coming out. Be careful.

224
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,000
Don't be scared. I will take care.

225
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,220
I can hear their voices
I think they are coming out. Okay?

226
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,040
Go! Go! Hurry up. Be quick!

227
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,036
Sir, they have started from home.

228
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,240
They seem to be heading
for the airport.

229
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,060
I'm following them sir

230
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,400
Where are you?
- Nagar - Which signal?

231
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,840
Punjagutta
Bus number? Bus number?

232
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:22,820
Which bus? Which bus? 10!
Why? Why? 10! 10! Its coming!

233
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,620

234
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,440
Get in... get in... go inside
Sir, they are going in 10 Y bus.

235
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,400
Bus number TS 01 AN 1184
Bus has just crossed Punjagutta signal

236
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,700
Why did he cut the call?

237
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,100
"Got a man with a plan right here.
Bringin' swag with the man right here."

238
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,440

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,980
"Master the blaster"

246
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,260
"Hey! No matter what they do"

247
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,660

"Yeah clap for me man right here"

257
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:36,600
"Got the man with the plan right here"

258
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,620

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,560

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520

00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:10,820
'Don't stop keep moving'

280
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,720
[amused chuckle]

281
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,270
'Stop... stop'

282
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,430
'Stop man'

289
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:52,520

I never got a chance to take a Metro train
from when it started operating

294
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:38,970
Thanks boys

295

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:46,600
Brave hearts continue the ride

298
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,180
Fainthearted alight

299
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,430

'Thanks sir'

303
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,520
(smug chuckle)

304
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,470
How are college students and
'dhoti' clad politicians connected?

305
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,810
Airport is close by

306
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:18,470
Catch an auto or something and go

307
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,640
Don't wait here Hurry up

'Turned out to be our friend
Jameel anna's auto I got in too'

310
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,360
'Easy-peasy that's where they got caught'

311
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
- Escape to Canada right?

312
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:43,560
'Friends encircled and took them
to the police station right?'

313
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,850
Yes sir

314
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,140
So you were responsible
for everything

315
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,810
- Yes sir
- JD had nothing to do with this?

316
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,520
We swear nothing at all sir

317
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,640
'Sir'

318
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,220
Those 2 boys swear
your teacher JD was behind this

319
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,430
- These students are lying
- Of course I know sir

320
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,770
JD is the culprit

321
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:02,420
- Who is JD? Umm... I will tell you.

322
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:06,036
Sir, Minister has come inside

323
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,906
If you are ready we can
escort him to the auditorium

324
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,060
Come... come

325
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,520

00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,360

329
00:24:16,021 --> 00:24:17,140
Not picking your call huh?

330
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,930
It's ringing but he isn't picking

331
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:21,560
He's same-same as
student and master huh?

332
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,810
Shut up da
Vanitha didn't you try?

333
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:25,600
- I asked the students

334
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,060
He's suspended it seems

335
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,940
If you had told us earlier we could
have gone in person and brought him

336
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,930
He must be very busy try again

337
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:34,280
"Got the man with the plan right here"

338
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,640
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

339
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,680
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"

340
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,430
"Yeah clap for me man right here"

341
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,980
Uncle he's our Principal
Premdas Samuel

342
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,430
'Ramya?'

343
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,140
If that student is such a troublemaker

344
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,270
...why not just dismiss him?

345
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,220
Then he should have
got dismissed 20 years ago!

346
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,770
What are you saying?

347
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,640
JD isn't a student my dear

348
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:01,680
Professor!

349
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,390

350
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,680

'Respected dignitaries on the dais'

354
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,390
'What-?'

355
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,350
We-

356
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:26,720
[loud cheering]

357
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,520
Sir students are refusing
to come from the back stage

358
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,980
I believe you said this function
won't go on without JD huh?

359
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,196
Then what sir? We kept
telling you he is not to blame

360
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,770
'You've suspended him for 2 weeks'

361
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:41,180
Any other day it's fine sir
This alumni meet is only for him

362
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,700
How can he not be present?
Nothing will happen here without him

363
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,850
Are you their leader?

364
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:46,930
I see

365
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,680
Just you wait!

366
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,060
Sir the minister has been
waiting for a long time

367
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,390
- Please bear with us
- He canceled so many appointments

368
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,180
- Start the program
- I'll talk to them and join you

369
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,350
Om Shanti! Om Shanti!
Peace in speech and spirit

370
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,680
- Call JD
- You suspended him and asking me to call?

371
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,930
- You call him
- I don't know his number

372
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:07,930
Call him dude

373
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,600
Call before he changes his mind

374
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,460
[humming a song]

375
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,340
"Hey Ramulo... Ramula...
she got me worried"

376
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,380
"Livin' up and sippin on beer"

377
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,140
Hello... huh... JD

378
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:24,360
This is Principal... Samuel here

379
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,720
JD sir is fast asleep

380
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:26,770
Call later

381
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,140
Principal Premadas Samuel

382
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,270
Prema! Your name can mean love but
he won't get up to hear your loving words

383
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:33,890
- Guzzled 3 or 4 bottles of booze
- 'Can you wake him up or not?'

384
00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:35,970
Huh...? No chance dear

385
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,270
Hey!

386
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,720
He's drunk

387
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:43,890
What can I do?

388
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:46,390
Will you ask your Education Minister
to wait for half an hour?

389
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,770
We'll go and get him

390
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,060
- Whaat?
- Do it

391
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,900
- What happened?

392
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,600
Is this how you drum-roll?

393
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,520
Getting paid right? Bump it

394
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,430
Rock and roll man

395
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,350

396
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,220
Ready ya Come on ya

397
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,760
"Master is coming move aside"

398
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,810
Hey stop... stop

399
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:25,100
Lift him

400
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,910
Heave-ho!

401
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,200
Speed up!

402
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,850
Sir good morning

403
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,320
Your tea sir

404
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,850
"When brother enters,
it's power of atom bomb..."

405
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,470
- Did they really invite me?
- Sir why this doubt?

406
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,100
'I swear they asked you to come'

407
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,270
Bro beat the drum

408
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,520
"Master coming!"

409
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,560
"Move aside!"

410
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,060
"Rock and roll!"

411
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:52,720
"Deliberately if you make trouble"

412
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,600
"It will boomerang on you centuple"

413
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,270
"If you jeer or sneer at us"

414
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,060
"Mind you you'll be limbless"

415
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:04,430
'Zazzorific!'

416
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:07,350
Aiyo!

417
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:12,970
"Stand in line... stand in line"

418
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:24,430
"Rock and roll Heart and soul"

419
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,180
"Brother... start it... start it"

420
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,270
"Move aside"

421
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:04,390
Aiyo!

422
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:34,850
"When brother enters,
it's power of atom bomb..."

423
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,060
"Brother... start it... start it"

424
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,600
"Master coming!"

425
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,430
Got tired sir?

426
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:07,100
- Where is the ID card?
- I have it sir

427
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,930
- First wear it and go inside
- Done

428
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,130
"Master coming!"

429
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,270
'JD'

430
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:35,850
Start the program

431
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:37,390
Sir 1 minute Let me speak

432
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,430
Sir-

433
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,350
Give this to JD sir

434
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,996
'I've attended
many college functions'

435
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,020
- Wear your ID card
- 'Witnessed many gatherings'

436
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,430
'But I've never seen a crowd like this'

437
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:49,970
Because the entire crowd here

438
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:52,180
More than the anchor of the show

439
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,220
'They are celebrating
the man seated there'

440
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,770
'It is no mean achievement'

441
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:58,560
'If he is getting this kind of
overwhelming reception among students'

442
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,890
'Then he must be a dedicated
and focused professor'

443
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,430
'If he himself is like this...'

444
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,100
'Imagine students supervised by him'

445
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,470
'Must be very disciplined'

446
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,470
'First give this man
a big round of applause'

447
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:12,890
To get a professor like him

448
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,020
You and your college
must be truly blessed

449
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,520
Your eyes are red
Wear this shade

450
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,390
'This most revered master'

451
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:21,560
'I would like him to come up
to the dais and say a few words'

452
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:23,930
'I am calling you sir'

453
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:24,970
Please come

454
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,970
Come up and speak

455
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,350
Hey...! Where are you going?

456
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:32,350
Wait let me tell a mini story

457
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,850
Did you look at your shoes?

458
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,310
Instead of being humiliated sit down

459
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,890
If you get up once more-

460
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,810
Please take your seat

461
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,520
JD is our-

462
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,140
Management and staff
are completely against JD

463
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,350
But students celebrate him

464
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,140
I don't get this

465
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,930
He has gone out of his way
for students' welfare

466
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,770
Students revere him as their true hero

467
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,640
So the management
took a strong dislike

468
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,390
Secondly after 6:00 p.m
our hero will be totally sloshed!

469
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,850
- Good morning sir
- Good morning

470
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,060
Careful sir

471
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,270
- Sorry... sorry
- 'Then what happened?'

472
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:51,470
Muralidhar is ogling a lot
- Hi... hi

473
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,060
Your classroom is at that end

474
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:54,640
Good morning

475
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,470
'What is his flash back sob story
to get sloshed every day?'

476
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,600
Don't ask him that alone

477
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,850
If he gets a gullible idiot he'll reel
off with whatever comes to his mouth

478
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:05,960
After that I took her home.
We fell in love

479
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:09,900
Just when I got the passport ready
to send her, the villain came.

480
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:12,400
Did you get caught? Wait sister.

481
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,760
Villain's name is

482
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,890
Mr. Obul Reddy.

483
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,680
We belonged to the same quarters.

484
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,720
I was in 8G She was in 7G

485
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:19,930
India is here

486
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,350
America is right here

487
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:24,600
I picked my guitar and started off
My darling she is

488
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:28,220
My lucky stars!
We loved each other in that birth.

489
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,810
I got the strength to beat up
even 500 people.

490
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:33,180
But we fell from the
mountain and died.

491
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:37,160
Ah! That's why I'm searching
for that girl in this birth.

492
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:37,980
Take your hands off me sir!

493
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,116
Hey! Hey! Hey!

494
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,560
Hey! Hey! Too much filmy imagination

495
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,930
Okay which department is he in?

496
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:46,260
He studied in this same college
He finished M.Phil Psychology here

497
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,700
'Now he teaches
Personality Development'

498
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,700
May I request you all
to please stand up?

499
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,020
I said... stand... up

500
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:58,040
Now I intend checking
if your mind and body are focused

501
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,080
We are hearing

502
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,430
But not listening

503
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:04,930
Students don't listen to their teachers
Teachers don't listen to their students

504
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,930
Now

505
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,020
RUN

506
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,220
Run... run... run

507
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,310
WATER!

508
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,850
Electricity...!

509
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,600
Children don't listen to their parents
Parents don't listen to their children

510
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:19,930
And finally

511
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,060
And... don't listen to their people

512
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,020
Whatever I tell you now
repeat it verbatim

513
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,100
But

514
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,930
Do just the opposite

515
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,560
Jump in

516
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,180
Jump left

517
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,180
Jump right Rei... rei...!

518
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,600
Now on the starboard

519
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,640
Faster... faster... faster

520
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,890
Now close your bloody eyes
and freeze

521
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,270
Class disperse

522
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,540
Getting late for my class

523
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,100
- We'll meet at lunch
- Okay sure

524
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,120
'Let me repeat this'

525
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,180
That bloody Bhavani is
responsible for all this

526
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,900
He finished off his opponents contesting
in our Union election one by one

527
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,020
I know his history A to Z

528
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,970
Gurumurthy brother whether these people
understand it or not hope you do

529
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
I have been saying this
right from the beginning

530
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,280
Who endorsed my view?

531
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,880
With the help of juveniles
he is into all criminal activities

532
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,176
Why are you siting quiet? Speak up!

533
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,930
We know this already

534
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:31,890
Greetings brother

535
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,880
What's it?

536
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,850
Are you such a big shot huh?

537
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:40,100
If you kill him will you get his post?

538
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,970
- Let me see - No bro

539
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:44,310
Why are you so mad at me?
I'm like a brother to you

540
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:45,680
Whatever it is
let's talk it over

541
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,520
Any need for me to talk to you?

542
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,720
I'll close your chapter!

543
00:36:48,770 --> 00:36:49,810
Get the car ready

544
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:51,850
Bro will a problem
be solved if we fight?

545
00:36:51,890 --> 00:36:54,180
Will murder solve the problem?
Let's discuss it amicably

546
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:57,810
I'll use the same juvenile delinquents
you use as tool to finish you off!

547
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,810
Want to wait and watch?

548
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,770
I'm like one of them
You watched me grow

549
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,850
- Wait bro
- You peed in your pants looking at me

550
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,140
You think you're my equal now?

551
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,020
Whatever it is let's talk it over

552
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,270
I am much younger than you
But pay heed to my words

553
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,430
Don't go brother

554
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,220
'Oh my God!'

555
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,680
Going... Gone brother?

556
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,720
So sad

557
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,270
You saw it, right?
What did I do?

558
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,890
If I had walked out talking to him
I would've shared his fate

559
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,850
Impossible for a human
to time this so perfectly

560
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,640
I pray to all Gods thrice daily

561
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,600
So God has saved me
and punished him

562
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,560
'May his soul rest in peace!'

563
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,900
To conduct Students' election
in our college this year

564
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,460
University Grants Commission has granted
permission but I opposed it strictly

565
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,480
But, for a mere formality
I need all your opinions

566
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,720
Why we don't want this election

567
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:52,790
For the records

568
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,210
I somehow feel it is unnecessary sir

569
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:56,540
'Semester is coming soon

570
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,950
'In the current scenario
why do we need an election?'

571
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,656
Yeah... you're right

572
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,276
'Sir if this is happening
some other issues will create'

573
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:03,590
- I don't think they are fit for elections
- Correct

574
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:05,380
'In my honest opinion no'

575
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,670
'I have no issues with
the day college students'

576
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,960
'I am a little apprehensive
about the evening batch'

577
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,130
Thanks Ramya

578
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,770
Charulatha your opinion?

579
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,630
Sorry sir, it's only been 2 days
since I joined sir

580
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,570
So if I voice my opinion
I don't know if it will be right

581
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,170
Come on what's there?

582
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,380
- No sir - Hey!

583
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,816
- Why is JD sir keeping quiet?
- That's right?

584
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,300
'I think election conduction
is a not good idea'

585
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,300
Sir to be on the safe side
ask JD his opinion

586
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,520
'JD tell us your opinion'

587
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,500
What is your opinion JD?

588
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,750
- What day was today?
- Thursday

589
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,340
Thursday is his day off bro

590
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:49,700
- 'Professor JD'
- He would have been piss drunk

591
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,790
- Come... come - Hey! Careful

592
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,750
JD...?

593
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,550
SIR!

594
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,410
Emergency sir emergency

595
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,220
What are you doing here?

596
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:01,146
Let me give this phone to Rosie madam
Its emergency

597
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,976
Her husband fell off his bike
When he climb the vehicle

598
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,740
A call came sir

599
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,476
I'm telling you

600
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,136
I'll suspend you
- Give me phone, I'll go away sir

601
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,060
Abdul, what happened? Tell me
- 'Wake up sir'

602
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,456
Phone is switch off
that's why they call me

603
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,040
Leave

604
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,290
- Poor husband - Hello

605
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,750
They are objecting to elections
Tell them something sir

606
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,480
- Sorry sir - Get out

607
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,120
- Useless fellow!
- Thank you sir

608
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,900
JD what is your opinion
about conducting elections?

609
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:25,500
Election is essential that's all

610
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,880
- I thought as much
- 'He will say something meaningless sir'

611
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,540
If we announce a students' election
all of them will be working of only that

612
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:35,520
Not one of them will study
nor will anyone attend any class

613
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:38,710
Correct, what will they learn
by conducting students' election?

614
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,130
Why politics in college?

615
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,880
Matthew sir

616
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,040
What is 'politics' sir?

617
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:47,320
Sir I don't wish to talk to you

618
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,090
Is that so? But I wish to speak

619
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:50,210
I'm coming

620
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,210
Sir

621
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,750
First a student should know
'politics' means service

622
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,860
Only if our students learn about election
canvassing leadership in college

623
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,566
...they will have an awareness about
state central elections for the future

624
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:07,340
College students are
our first time voters

625
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:09,480
Only if students are allowed to think

626
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,396
A new leader will emerge
for the next generation

627
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,560
To mould as a good leader
or to choose the right leader

628
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,080
...they will acquire maturity

629
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,500
For someone to-

630
00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:20,590
They will stick posters all over
and spoil the walls with graffiti

631
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:22,680
Then claim ownership
over the walls and fight

632
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:24,726
Doesn't all this happen
in normal elections outside?

633
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:25,750
Sit down sir

634
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,500
Aren't these normal issues
that crop up in general elections?

635
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,920
So can we decide to
abolish elections in our country?

636
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:35,380
We have grown up with this culture of
poster banner fanfare still follow it

637
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,840
If students should know
the do's and don'ts of poster etc

638
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
...we must conduct
elections in college

639
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,750
Only then he will be
a good example outside

640
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:46,920
'If our culture of bribing with 'biriyani'
booze and big bucks should change'

641
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,460
...students should know
the ins and outs of politics

642
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,630
Okay

643
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,540
Let's assume what you're
saying is right

644
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:57,500
Who is responsible if students resort
to violence or damage college property?

645
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,630
Sir nothing of that sort will happen

646
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,290
If something happen
will you leave this college?

647
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,500
Will you resign huh?

648
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,500
We'll see if it happens

649
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,790
Then you be the presiding officer

650
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,340
And conduct this election

651
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,750
If any problem crops up

652
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,000
Give a letter
you will leave this college

653
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,250
Coming June 25th
Students' elections

654
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,000
[loud cheering]

655
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:30,790
I haven't seen him conduct
an election as a master

656
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,670
'But I've seen him
do the same as a student'

657
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,170
Shake your hands

658
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,750
This is the wall of democracy

659
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,590
Your rules and regulations

660
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,750
'Gym facilities free for all students'

661
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,380
'Non veg will be served
for all in the hostel'

662
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,590
'Good orators have become able leaders'

663
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:06,210
You should speak up more boldly Savi

664
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:08,750
'Instead of finding faults
with your rival and campaigning'

665
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,590
'...ask for votes
listing your reforms'

666
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:14,000
Tear every single poster dude

667
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,880
Posters and banners should be stuck
or erected in their allocated places

668
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,170
'Even if there's a small brawl
among the students'

669
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,710
'...election will be canceled'

670
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,710
You pull back and fire

671
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,750
Cheers! - Sir!

672
00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:27,880
'Our total strength is 5500 students sir'

673
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,170
We have divided them
into 10 categories

674
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,590
What is this column?

675
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:34,210
That is religion and caste category

676
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,920
Let's avoid that

677
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,420
Only if we delete it here

678
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:40,840
It won't follow us in our life

679
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:46,250
Hey! How much longer do you intend
drinking and roaming around?

680
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:48,000
Why yell at me for no reason?

681
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,130
Will I yell at you
if you are steady on your feet?

682
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:54,380
- I am steady - Shall we see?

683
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,240
Hit an arrow
anywhere on this board

684
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,760
I'll agree you are
sober and steady

685
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:01,750
Bro, strike on the dot!

686
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,000
Here's department wise

687
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,380
Cheers!

688
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,960
'I've been given so many person
experience in counseling'

689
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,840
If you can tell me the reason
I can do my level best to help you

690
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,750
Since my childhood,
I've been very fond of my aunt.

691
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,420
Rejecting her grandpa,
she got married and went off

692
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,550
- Oh!

693
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,710
To console the grandpa,
I went in search of my aunt

694
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:36,766
Without revealing about myself,
I went to work at her house as a driver.

695
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:38,920
My aunt has a lovely daughter.

696
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,970
Myself and the girl fell in love
without the knowledge of others

697
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,220
Actually, to tell my aunt
who I am and why I came...

698
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,900
I asked for the entire
railway station to be vacated.

699
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,320
Ah... vacated the railway station?

700
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,840
'Tomorrow if you have a problem

701
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,170
'Even if it's midnight
I'll be there for you'

702
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,340
Why should we create problems
and end up in the police station?

703
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,790
Beverages free in the canteen

704
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:18,000
Aqua training access free

705
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,420
You will have campus interviews
You'll leave the college with a job in hand

706
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:23,420
Above all give this serious thought

707
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,460
Do you want to be ruled by a girl?

708
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,040
Or revel in a boy's leadership?

709
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,960
Hey! That isn't even my glass

710
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,190
Some other chap has relished
a drink and gone madcaps!

711
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,990
Bloody

712
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:07,610
Sir...?

713
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,130
'Fourth round sir'

714
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,500
They'll announce final result

715
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:13,130
I'm scared sir

716
00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:20,000
Isn't Arjun Prasad a big leader?

717
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,210
4th round it seems

718
00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:22,420
Get lost!

719
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,460
'Most awaiting election results
are going to be announce very soon'

720
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,380
'What is happening over there?'

721
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,810
going to be declared - Wait

722
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,130
Bhargav 2588 votes

723
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,630
'Savitha 2648 votes'

724
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,710
'Savitha won the election by 60 votes'

725
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:56,420
[loud cheering]

726
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,566
Congrats chairperson

727
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,180
We will face everything

728
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,196
Sir I think they have already
started creating a ruckus there

729
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,750
Sir what do we do now?

730
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,340
Why do you still ask me?

731
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,590
Ask her

732
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:10,790
Chairman tell us what to do?

733
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:13,250
Ah...'Sir'

734
00:46:13,290 --> 00:46:17,500
To avoid unnecessary confusion
I'm thinking of talking to Bhargav directly

735
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,060
It's good

736
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,750
Go happily

737
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,370
But go alone

738
00:46:23,250 --> 00:46:24,340
Madam

739
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:27,670
Don't dilly-dally scratch your head
crack your knuckles and keep looking back

740
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:29,540
Don't dawdle and
do 'installment' walk

741
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:30,630
Forward march!

742
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:36,250
Sir will you give me your bracelet?

743
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,440
Why?

744
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:38,790
Please give sir

745
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:45,210
There is a Botany lecture and a matinee
picture. Which would you vote for

746
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:51,170
There's a history lecture and a
mystery picture. Brother which is best?

747
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,720
Botany class is a big bore.
History lecture is...

748
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,960
I want to talk to you

749
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,420
If she comes offering a truce
I'll break the bones on her face

750
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:13,040
- Bro tell me - 'What happened?'

751
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,420
Our son lost bro

752
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:15,630
What?

753
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,720
Bhargav... Ah....

754
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,670
I came to congratulate

755
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:23,590
Winning by just 60 votes
is no big victory at all

756
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:27,250
Ah... is there any rule in college
there should be only 1 chairman?

757
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:30,630
You take over day college
and I'll handle evening college

758
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,000
Okay bye

759
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,290
Congrats

760
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:37,920
I extended my hand
even on nomination day

761
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,420
You didn't want to shake hands

762
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,130
At least let it be truce now?

763
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,540
I don't think it's safe
for her to go alone

764
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:49,380
Shall I go and check sir?

765
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:59,420
Hmmm... let's shake hands

766
00:48:00,630 --> 00:48:02,250
- Okay - How ridiculous bro?

767
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,880
You compromise with her

768
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,710
'He is shaking hands
with that girl who won'

769
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,750
'Let me talk to him'

770
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:07,750
1 minute bro

771
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:08,880
'Babu'

772
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,840
Dad there's no problem
I spoke to that girl

773
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,170
She even asked me to be
the chairman for Day college

774
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,250
'You got a sudden desire to
beg a post from her huh?'

775
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:21,170
It isn't what you think
I'll come in person and explain you

776
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,380
- Bro
- 'Pack him home safely from there'

777
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,120
Okay bro

778
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,210
'If he refuses to go threaten him'
- Okay bro

779
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,920
- 'Rough up that girl who defeated him'
- I'll handle it

780
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:35,120
I'll explain to my dad
Please don't create a ruckus

781
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,130
He has given me permission
to scar even your face bro

782
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:39,856
First get inside

783
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,340
But please don't hurt that girl

784
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:43,210
Sir he wasn't nasty to me

785
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:44,960
I shook hands and he said okay

786
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,590
That's all

787
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:47,960
Celebrations are done

788
00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:50,210
Hey! Catch

789
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,340
Give it to all

790
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,860
- Where's the booth?

791
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,360
Clear up all this mess

792
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,630
Sir evening college students are
planning to burn down the booth

793
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:14,000
- Who is he?
- Professor bro

794
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,790
- What?
- That wasn't a proper election

795
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,940
- We demand re-election or re-counting
- Election is over that's all

796
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,766
- Burn down the booth
- Which department are you?

797
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:22,840
- Come here
- Stop this bloody idle talk

798
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:25,970
I'll kill you son of a gun
I'll break all your teeth!

799
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,900
Please be quiet!

800
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:31,210
- Sir let go
- 'Shut up all of you'

801
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:34,350
I'm talking with them

802
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:37,840
Evening college chairman candidate
Bhargav wants to talk to you sir

803
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,670
'My dad didn't listen to me'

804
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:42,340
He has sent 50-60 Party riff-raffs
to bash up everyone in college

805
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,750
'They have merged with the students
Ensure our college students are safe sir'

806
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,710
On the starboard!

807
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:54,960
- 'Why are all of them spinning?
- What are they doing?'

808
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,040
Now close your bloody eyes and freeze

809
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,090
'What are you doing?
Tell us bro'

810
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:00,710
'Sticking to the wall like glue?'

811
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:01,790
Move forward

812
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,210
'They are doing just the opposite'

813
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,130
'Wait don't go'

814
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,790
Send all the girls home safe

815
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,790
- Sir?
- Just do as I say

816
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,040
Take all of them through the back door

817
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,710
Go... go... fast

818
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:19,710
'Bloody! Bash him up'

819
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,276
'Hey, stop'

820
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:47,560
Grab her... Catch her!

821
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,940
Hey!

822
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:16,620
Go! Go! Go!

823
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:22,040
The students are uncontrollable

824
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:34,300
Leave me...
- Take your hands off

825
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:40,140
How dare you beat a girl?

826
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,676
Its not a big wound sir.
Just a nail's scratch

827
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,656
Hey, The meeting is happening
in the library.

828
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,360
Is everyone safe?

829
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:31,576
'I have checked all the groups'
They have texted me

830
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,856
The entire riot has been recorded
in our college CCTV cameras

831
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,396
Is he behaving like a professor?

832
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:39,196
Excuse me ma'am you are
talking about damage of property

833
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,620
Rowdies got together and
bashed up 4-5 of our girls

834
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:43,556
What could all the teachers do?

835
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,676
- No one came to stop them
- Stop it Charu

836
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,416
It isn't even 1 month
since you joined this college

837
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:49,540
Just keep quiet

838
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,196
What the hell are they discussing?

839
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,117
I'll be back

840
00:52:54,141 --> 00:52:56,080
I'll talk to JD

841
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,920
If he is coming back to the college,
we will all resign.

842
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,260
No,
Mr. Premadas. You cannot decide in haste.

843
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,796
Sir I have already given
a commitment I'll resign

844
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:08,176
I'm just leaving this college

845
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,220
JD just wait in the car

846
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,616
- 'I need to talk to you'
- Sir...?

847
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,580
I said 'wait'

848
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,096
'I understand'

849
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:19,456
If they need to know your worth

850
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,340
A gap is essential

851
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,416
Your decision is correct

852
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:26,416
You wanted a break for 3 months?

853
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,300
I have granted it

854
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,340
When did I ask?

855
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,940
Isn't this your signature?

856
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,460
Sir

857
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,276
Carbon copy sir

858
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,020
Oh! Come on JD

859
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:48,476
Didn't you ask for a break
of 3 months intending to teach?

860
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,700
Teach? In which college?

861
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,440
College?

862
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,320
As you have mentioned
Observation Home

863
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,236
Sir don't play the fool

864
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:59,656
What will I do there?

865
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,960
I didn't sign this

866
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,560
Maybe after 6:00 p.m?

867
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,996
After 6:00 p.m

868
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,576
Good chance

869
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:13,620
See

870
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:17,060
JD you're losing control
on yourself

871
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,616
If there's any issue in the election
didn't you agree to resign your job?

872
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,476
That means you have
something on your mind

873
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,376
Fine sir I'll go I'll go

874
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,196
Well... I have many 'well' wishers here

875
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,996
This must be their handiwork

876
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,660
It's okay I need a change too I'll go

877
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:40,300
'Inspector is waiting in your mansion
to explain job you'll be undertaking'

878
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,480
'That means'

879
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,257
What's it Yadhav?

880
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,296
You say you didn't
give this information?

881
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:48,980
No bro

882
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,800
Then how come police know about my fight
with the lawyer in the union office?

883
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:55,140
I don't know brother

884
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:00,036
This Anirudh who makes
songs for movies...

885
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:02,400
He has released a new song

886
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,560
Shall we hear that?

887
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:09,080
- Listen - 'Bro'

888
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,476
'Bhavani has fixed the date
You are his next target'

889
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:14,696
'He has decided to kill you too

890
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,796
What do you say bigamist?

891
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,696
At least is this your voice
or will you claim its mimicry?

892
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,760
- Bro - Did you call me Bhavani?

893
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,236
Make sure the boys are supplied
their regular dose of drinks and drugs

894
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,820
Whether they get
3 square meals a day or not

895
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:33,236
Booze and dope should flow steadily

896
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:35,540
Okay Bhavani I'll see to it

897
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,816
Where was I?

898
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:41,056
You got me married and how
can you make my wife a widow?

899
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,136
Tell me bro

900
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,100
Wait I'm choking with emotion
hearing your sentimental speech

901
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:51,476
Why are you jerking?

902
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,180
I had tucked the knife in my waist
What if it pierces me in wrong place?

903
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,756
- Not that
- Suppose an enemy kills us

904
00:55:58,780 --> 00:56:01,236
Doesn't matter if they say
'that's how Bhavani died a noble death'

905
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:05,016
If they say 'he had tucked a knife
that stabbed him in a wrong spot'

906
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,876
Does that sound good?

907
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,856
- No - No right?

908
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,636
- Lean back comfortably
- Don't bro

909
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,476
- Is that a show of respect?
- Yes bro

910
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,616
How is it over the phone
all this 'bro' kinship is missing?

911
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,120
Don't brother. Lean back

912
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,200
Don't brother

913
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:21,320
Won't you comply with
your bro's death wish for you?

914
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,820
SIT BACK SIT BACK!

915
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,476
Hey Gopal!

916
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:39,056
- Hey - 'Yes bro'

917
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,376
Tell me bro

918
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,936
Ask Das to pick 2 boys
10-15 years old to surrender

919
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,056
- Okay bro - Go

920
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,340
Bro...? Huh?

921
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:48,480
A new master has been recruited
for our reformatory it seems

922
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:51,696
- Okay... so?
- I don't know if you know

923
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,940
They usually appoint
a master for the jail

924
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,516
All of you are giving a build up
as if it is Breaking News!

925
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,816
Dispose of this body and
ask someone to drive this truck

926
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:00,840
Okay bro

927
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,576
Sir can we switch off that cacophony!

928
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,500
- Then shall I wear my coolers?!
- Huh?

929
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:31,660
Sir college students are bound by
certain protocols of parents and society

930
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,956
But those boys there
lack all that discipline

931
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,680
Their age and their activities
have no connection whatsoever

932
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:44,380
'Not even a single inmate
is human

933
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:45,440
'Beasts'

934
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,440
Idiots

935
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,696
'They know our law is lenient
to their habitual crimes'

936
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,516
'They use it to their advantage
breaking laws as reckless criminals'

937
00:57:56,540 --> 00:57:57,796
'That's why I'm telling you sir'

938
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:02,240
'Don't try to reform them
during those 3 months assigned to you

939
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:07,420
Aren't you wondering
whether to go there or not?

940
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,600
'Sir...?'

941
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,320
'Sir...!'

942
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,520
Ugh?

943
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,716
'Is brother sleeping?

944
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,800
Sir check if that's your phone?

945
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,056
Bro... bro

946
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,060
'Wake up bro'

947
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,457
Not mine

948
00:58:21,481 --> 00:58:22,796
Oh! Brother's phone

949
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:25,516
That's no problem sir
I don't mind going

950
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:27,776
- I can handle them - Sir

951
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,800
So have you decided to go?

952
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:46,060
Das...?

953
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:48,740
That Master will be here tomorrow

954
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:50,916
Despite knowing about this place

955
00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:52,400
...if he is ready to set foot here

956
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:54,716
Don't take him lightly

957
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:56,056
First let him land up

958
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:58,156
After he steps in here

959
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:00,340
Let's see if he lasts here
even for half an hour

960
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:12,956
You should be in there
by 10'o clock

961
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:15,880
If you freshen up
I can take you in my car

962
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,076
In that vehicle?

963
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,016
- 'Yes' - Okay you go

964
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,800
- If you come soon-
- I'll shower and come

965
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,040
Life is a pain hmmm?

966
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:33,520
90 days...

967
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,260
If he comes in goes to the board and
starts taking a lesson

968
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,260
...ask all of them
to fling these at him

969
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:54,300
Das

970
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,460
Bro Das
Doesn't look like a master

971
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:54,180
He and his beard...
No book or cane in hand

972
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,930
He looks so local

973
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:59,460
We'll provoke him and then pounce

974
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:23,720
Master! They call me master!

975
01:01:29,510 --> 01:01:31,390
Master

976
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,640
"If you step foot in our place
it is trespassing into our space"

977
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:38,090
"We will hassle you to the root
Master change your route"

978
01:01:38,140 --> 01:01:41,050
"As juveniles we roam
in this Observation Home"

979
01:01:41,090 --> 01:01:44,200
If you ask us to study, we can't add up

980
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,660
Don't think of catching
our necks and scaring us

981
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:50,240
Hey! Don't catch our necks to scare...

982
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,460
Rocking song guys. Why did you stop?

983
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,420
Hey! Hey... Hey... Songs!

984
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:01,780
Wow! There seem to be
a lot of artistes here...

985
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:05,720
Are you setting out to play?

986
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,940
Why? Shouldn't we go?

987
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,340
I don't interfere in the likes
or dislikes of anyone boss

988
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,800
Whoever wants to play go ahead
Want to sit here be my guest

989
01:02:12,920 --> 01:02:15,540
'I am allergic to the sun
I'll sit right here'

990
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:16,680
Should I teach now?

991
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,520
- No... no - We want to play

992
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:20,680
Very good

993
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:24,180
- 'I must catch up on Amazon Netflix'
- Shall we give the letter now brother?

994
01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,460
'I hate the sight of
this classroom bench'

995
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,566
- 'I will throw all this out'
- Not now I'll tell you

996
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:33,640
Don't indulge in all this graffiti
on the board bathroom walls

997
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,930
You focus on your work
and I'll stick to my job

998
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:37,430
Deal?

999
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,800
We thought of chasing you away
if you started lessons today

1000
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,340
You are unique master

1001
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:42,550
He seems to be one of us

1002
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:44,510
Turned out I'm quite jobless

1003
01:02:44,550 --> 01:02:46,090
Why waste time sitting?

1004
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:50,680
Why is this place so dirty
and stinking to high heaven?

1005
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,300
We celebrate 10 festivals a year
and some 20 birthdays of leaders

1006
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:57,050
You don't clean up this place
and celebrate on any occasion?

1007
01:02:57,090 --> 01:02:58,140
'Celebrate' means?

1008
01:02:58,930 --> 01:03:00,390
That means-

1009
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:01,470
Have a blast huh?

1010
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:02,640
Right

1011
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,680
Rock on

1012
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:06,220
We have no idea of day or date
Quit talking

1013
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,360
Not that. Some of you were singing
when I entered

1014
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:12,010
- Who were they?
- We sang

1015
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:14,090
What the four of you just sang

1016
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,260
If 40 of you sing in chorus

1017
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,760
That's celebration

1018
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:22,050
Come with me I'll show you

1019
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:31,180
Beat it

1020
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,470
"Let me sing a 'Chitti' story
Pay attention listen to me"

1021
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,740
Why singing in English bro?

1022
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:49,000
Just listen bro

1023
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:53,240
"Let me sing a 'Chitti' story
Pay attention listen to me"

1024
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:55,536
"If you want take it or else..."

1025
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,880
"No tension, leave it, baby..."

1026
01:03:58,020 --> 01:04:00,160
"Life is very short..."

1027
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,680
"Always be happy..."

1028
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:09,936
"Problems from all around
will come and go..."

1029
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:12,980
"Chill out little, boy..."

1030
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:15,956
"Together, man..."

1031
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:18,056
"Let me sing a 'Chitti' story..."

1032
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:20,536
"Pay attention listen to me..."

1033
01:04:20,560 --> 01:04:23,196
"If you want take it or else..."

1034
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:25,556
"No tension, leave it, baby..."

1035
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,700
"Life is very short..."

1036
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,680
"Always be happy..."

1037
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:38,136
"Problems from all around
will come and go..."

1038
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,456
"Chill out little, boy..."

1039
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,856
"No tension"

1040
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
"Baby"

1041
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,656
"If you go speed...
Faster you reach destination..."

1042
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:05,880
"If you're slow and steady...
Reach education goals..."

1043
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:15,276
"Anger is misery baby"

1044
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:20,276
"Friend is very powerful dude"

1045
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:24,996
"Haters are gonna hate... but...
Ignore them..."

1046
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:29,636
"Negativity... Kick it out..."

1047
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:34,176
"Focus on what you dream...
Don't worry, boy..."

1048
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:38,036
"Positivity brings change in life..."

1049
01:05:38,060 --> 01:05:40,340
"Life is very short..."

1050
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:44,060
"Always be happy..."

1051
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:50,236
"Very many problems
will come and go..."

1052
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:52,400
"Chill out little, boy..."

1053
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:56,660
"Students..."

1054
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:58,700
"Let me sing a 'Chitti' story...

1055
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:02,980
"Pay attention listen to me...
If you want take it or else..."

1056
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:06,356
"No tension, leave it, baby..."

1057
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,300
"Life is very short..."

1058
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:11,120
"Always be happy..."

1059
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:18,080
"Designs of problems
will come and go"

1060
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:21,820
"Chill out little boy"

1061
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,260
"No tension baby"

1062
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:56,396
"Hard work is important
Smart work is important..."

1063
01:06:56,420 --> 01:07:01,076
"Self motivation is always with you..."

1064
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,776
"Education is important..."

1065
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,236
"Dedication is also important..."

1066
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,356
"Self evaluation is real war..."

1067
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,100
"Don't be a person
spreading hatred, boy..."

1068
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:19,056
"No backbiting, please...
Crappy..."

1069
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,996
"Always be polite and
just don't be nasty..."

1070
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:28,560
"You be the reason
to make someone happy..."

1071
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:31,556
"Life is very short..."

1072
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:34,360
"Always be happy..."

1073
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:40,276
"Problems in many
will come and go..."

1074
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:45,296
"Chill out little, boy..."

1075
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,217
"Last time"

1076
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:48,456
"Let me sing a 'Chitti' story

1077
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,556
"Pay attention listen to me..."

1078
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,436
"If you want take it or else..."

1079
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,856
"No tension, leave it, baby..."

1080
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,900
"Life is very short..."

1081
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:01,160
"Always be happy..."

1082
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:07,496
"Designs of problems
will come and go..."

1083
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:10,560
"Chill out little, boy..."

1084
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:15,116
"Hey! That was my 'Chitti' story..."

1085
01:08:15,140 --> 01:08:19,260
"How was my short story...
That was my 'Chitti' story..."

1086
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,096
"How was my 'Chitti' story?"

1087
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,840
"How was my 'Chitti'...
'Chitti' story!!!!"

1088
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,240
Go... go... go....

1089
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:40,180
Brother... Why is he sleeping?

1090
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:41,840
Quick wake him up

1091
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:43,180
Sir

1092
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:45,010
Sir

1093
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:46,340
Sir?

1094
01:08:46,970 --> 01:08:49,050
- Put the letter in his pocket
- He is sleeping bro

1095
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:50,300
Just do it

1096
01:08:55,430 --> 01:08:56,510
Hey!

1097
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,430
Who is that tickling me?

1098
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,656
I can hear footsteps we'll talk
to him over the phone tonight

1099
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:02,970
Come away

1100
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,220
Come come come

1101
01:09:10,840 --> 01:09:13,840
Thank God only another 89 days left

1102
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,430
Go home

1103
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:44,300
Brother Brother Stop Brother

1104
01:09:44,740 --> 01:09:46,400
I noticed just now

1105
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:49,120
Don't know who played this prank
Why are you riding a cycle?

1106
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:50,640
I can drop you in my car

1107
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:52,220
That's alright

1108
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,550
I was hoping at least
you will bring about a change

1109
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,720
Why? It's all going smooth

1110
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,460
The boys are having fun

1111
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:02,300
We are submerged in problems

1112
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,680
Half the boys have
drug addiction problem.

1113
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:07,430
Whatever they get
they readily use as weapons

1114
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,060
Everyday some boy or the other
twists his arm or ankle

1115
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,640
Why tell me all these sob stories?
Am I the police or what?

1116
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,090
I'm just a teacher here

1117
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:16,010
Sir you don't understand

1118
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:17,640
The police will nab the criminals

1119
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:18,720
Court will punish them

1120
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:19,930
To guide these boys

1121
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:21,890
To sift and sieve right from wrong

1122
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:24,550
We are not equipped sir
They need a master like you

1123
01:10:43,470 --> 01:10:44,510
'What happened bro?'

1124
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:46,930
'I tried 10-15 times
He isn't picking my call'

1125
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:48,720
'Try again bro'

1126
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:52,720
"Got the man with the plan right here"

1127
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:55,050
"Bringin' swag with the man right here"

1128
01:11:19,760 --> 01:11:21,220
'He isn't picking our call'

1129
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:24,510
Do you remember
Charu sister's number?

1130
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,900
Try to call her again bro

1131
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:28,540
'Hurry up'

1132
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,560
Mani speaking akka
`You saw me in the Observation Home

1133
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,680
- Someone is coming - 'Tell me'

1134
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,880
Lets go. Stop....stop

1135
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:18,220
Eat

1136
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,800
Brother

1137
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:23,260
- We don't want - Why?

1138
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:24,840
Not hungry

1139
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,430
Is that so?

1140
01:12:27,390 --> 01:12:28,970
You heard him right?

1141
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:33,590
Half baked nutcase!

1142
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:39,140
How much we have suffered
starving in this same spot moron

1143
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:42,800
Get me some water

1144
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,760
Bro I'm scared-

1145
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,090
Lucky to get a leg piece
in a 'biriyani'

1146
01:12:50,930 --> 01:12:52,640
You can even kill someone

1147
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:54,430
But not rob him of food

1148
01:12:55,430 --> 01:12:56,640
Go on eat

1149
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:04,760
Water

1150
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:07,930
Enough

1151
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,260
They took my phone though
they knew very well it was mine

1152
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:21,640
Whom did you call?

1153
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:23,180
No one bro

1154
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:25,970
No brother

1155
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,370
Tell the truth. Whom did you call?

1156
01:13:27,680 --> 01:13:28,760
I don't know

1157
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,840
Ma... master bro

1158
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:32,140
Who?

1159
01:13:32,220 --> 01:13:34,050
The master who joined duty

1160
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:36,550
- Master huh?
- He's a boozer bro

1161
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:38,840
You don't have to take him
seriously at all bro

1162
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,640
Why call the master?

1163
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,510
My father died when I was a kid

1164
01:13:44,550 --> 01:13:47,260
Couldn't bear the hunger
I stole and got caught

1165
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,720
They piled cases on me

1166
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,510
And sent me to this
Ju... Juvenile Home bro

1167
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:54,180
We are being released tomorrow

1168
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:58,090
But he is asking me to surrender
for a murder case bro

1169
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:01,510
If my mother gets to know this
she will die of shock bro

1170
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:07,300
If you had called me
instead of calling that master

1171
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,050
I'm emotional by nature you see

1172
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:11,470
I would have assigned
someone else to surrender

1173
01:14:12,050 --> 01:14:14,340
Not wanting to surrender
isn't a mistake on your part

1174
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:16,510
But you wanted to sneak
our internal information

1175
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:18,260
Isn't that a grave mistake?

1176
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:21,640
Grown-up boy you tell me
What you did was wrong or not?

1177
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:23,760
- Yes it was wrong
- So I am right?

1178
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:27,390
Enough of eating 'biriyani'

1179
01:14:27,470 --> 01:14:30,010
I'll take it You've had enough

1180
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:31,090
Here take this

1181
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,470
Aren't we both very young bro?

1182
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,390
Think of us as your younger brother
and please forgive us this time

1183
01:14:36,430 --> 01:14:39,550
My dear only boys like you
should not be pardoned

1184
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:42,640
They pardoned me
Look how it has shaped me

1185
01:14:43,090 --> 01:14:44,340
How do we deal with this?

1186
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:47,260
We won't repeat this bro
We won't snitch to anyone

1187
01:14:48,510 --> 01:14:51,760
Listen you can be scared
of anyone in this world

1188
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,090
But if death knocks at our door

1189
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,510
...even if it is Lord Yama
you shouldn't be scared

1190
01:14:58,220 --> 01:15:00,050
I'll give you 2 minutes

1191
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:03,470
Kill me and then save
your brother and yourself

1192
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,800
What were you doing
when these kids stole your phone?

1193
01:15:08,840 --> 01:15:11,140
On top of it you have
this stuck up attitude!

1194
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,920
- Go away - I won't leave you

1195
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:14,780
Listen to me Just run away

1196
01:15:14,940 --> 01:15:16,400
- Run outside - Listen to me

1197
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,180
Mess up all my orders
Only plus is your voice! Go

1198
01:15:19,300 --> 01:15:20,600
You have got another minute

1199
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:21,550
Decide fast

1200
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,540
Go away from here

1201
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,780
I won't leave you alone

1202
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:34,380
'What are you doing brother?'

1203
01:15:38,390 --> 01:15:40,300
This is what I expected from you!

1204
01:15:41,720 --> 01:15:43,420
Clear out

1205
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:56,390
Brother!!!

1206
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:59,010
Wake up bro Get up

1207
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:01,550
I'm constable Rajalingam
Get up bro

1208
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:03,960
School starts only at 8'o clock
Why are you waking me-

1209
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,180
We have a problem on hand
Inspector wants to see you

1210
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:08,800
Why should I meet the inspector?

1211
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,320
You have to get up now
You don't realize the gravity of-

1212
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:12,340
Okay I'll get up

1213
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:14,090
Don't shake me up like a rattle!

1214
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:15,930
Go I'll follow

1215
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:18,550
'I will come'

1216
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:28,550
Start... make it quick

1217
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,840
[overlap of angry voices]

1218
01:16:47,050 --> 01:16:49,640
'Hey! Don't push
How many times to tell you?'

1219
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,440
'Be quiet'

1220
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:10,900
"Tender little hearts...
Will they cease to beat?"

1221
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:14,720
"Whether here or in graveyard...
Life is same..."

1222
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,800
'What are you gawking at huh?'

1223
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:17,970
Yov! Who are you?

1224
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,140
- Get out - Sir... sir

1225
01:17:19,180 --> 01:17:20,680
He is our class master

1226
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:23,616
Oh! You are that master huh?
First I have to interrogate you

1227
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:26,260
What did you do with the boys?
It never happened like this earlier

1228
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:27,930
Did you hit any of the boys?

1229
01:17:27,970 --> 01:17:29,010
Tell me

1230
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,800
Can't you hear me? Answer man

1231
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,900
Sir what is this?

1232
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:36,406
Not here I need to
take him for inquiry

1233
01:17:36,430 --> 01:17:38,430
'Get him into our police jeep'
- Okay sir

1234
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,050
'Can't you hear me?'

1235
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:42,430
If I say once isn't that enough?

1236
01:17:42,470 --> 01:17:44,430
- Move aside - Stand outside

1237
01:17:44,470 --> 01:17:46,360
"But wings never fluttered..."

1238
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:47,870
"Is it world that won't melt hearts?"

1239
01:18:16,180 --> 01:18:18,800
Bhavani can we come with you?

1240
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:21,510
He has asked me to come
by myself I can handle it

1241
01:18:21,550 --> 01:18:24,090
What about... that master
who is in police custody?

1242
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:29,140
I came out of the
reformatory 15 years ago

1243
01:18:29,180 --> 01:18:31,420
Reason I've been patient
for the past 5 years

1244
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:34,930
I wanted to kill these 3 men and
become the president of the Drivers' union

1245
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:37,840
2 men are dead and gone
This is the last one to go down

1246
01:18:37,890 --> 01:18:39,050
He has sent for me

1247
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,010
Is he my priority?

1248
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,180
Or is this master important?

1249
01:18:43,340 --> 01:18:44,510
He's only important

1250
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,720
- What shall we do with this master?
- I'll handle him

1251
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,800
- Sure?
- No problem. We will take care

1252
01:18:48,840 --> 01:18:50,680
Shall I go now?
- We'll take care

1253
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:53,010
Let's go

1254
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:00,510
Come with me

1255
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:09,680
Where are you going?

1256
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,140
- 2 minutes sir
- Quick sir will be here anytime

1257
01:19:12,180 --> 01:19:14,090
'Are you the mother of
those 2 boys who died?'

1258
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:16,050
- 'Yes sir - Is that so?'

1259
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:17,470
'Give him all the details'

1260
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:19,050
Boozed upto your brow huh?

1261
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:21,720
- 'Sit outside - Okay sir'

1262
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:25,480
If someone is calling you
10 times from the same number

1263
01:19:25,660 --> 01:19:27,820
...won't it occur to you
it may be a serious problem?

1264
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,200
No Ch... Charu

1265
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,066
Why are you staring so blankly?

1266
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:34,220
I was a volunteer in an NGO
before I took up this post here

1267
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:37,800
Based on a complaint I went
for inspection to that Observation Home

1268
01:19:38,260 --> 01:19:40,720
That's how I befriended those 2 boys

1269
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:44,640
They told me about the injustice
in that reformatory

1270
01:19:44,680 --> 01:19:47,430
But I couldn't take
any legal action

1271
01:19:47,470 --> 01:19:48,800
So many vile threats

1272
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,640
The only reason I shifted to city
was to handle such cases myself

1273
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,930
I needed to be financially secure
So I took up this lecturer's post

1274
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:58,970
When you defended the students
my faith was recharged

1275
01:19:59,800 --> 01:20:02,760
I was convinced this flawed system
could be changed for the better

1276
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,090
I forged your signature
for this post

1277
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,220
Even for your job
I was the one who applied

1278
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:13,430
Even the founder is aware of this
Now I feel that was a big mistake

1279
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:19,220
If you hadn't come here
at least those 2 boys would be alive

1280
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:24,720
Now both of them have left us
How can you defend yourself sir?

1281
01:20:29,640 --> 01:20:33,430
See I had no idea whatsoever
No one told me anything

1282
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:35,590
When have you been
sober enough to understand?

1283
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:39,090
Have you ever realized anytime
who is talking to you?

1284
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,840
I have my share of personal problems

1285
01:20:44,890 --> 01:20:46,680
I am unable to come out of it

1286
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:48,590
I can't

1287
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,390
I'm unable to cry

1288
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:53,800
I can't cry I can't sleep
at night either

1289
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,390
That's why

1290
01:20:56,970 --> 01:20:58,390
I drink

1291
01:20:58,430 --> 01:21:02,360
I swear I never thought
it would be this horrific

1292
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,680
Oh! You can never cry right?

1293
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,140
'I can't understand
'Tell me without crying'

1294
01:21:07,220 --> 01:21:09,720
Charu where are you taking me

1295
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,390
I never thought I would see them dead

1296
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:14,180
This is the lady who gave birth
to those boys who are dead now

1297
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:15,720
I had reassured her

1298
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:16,930
A master will come

1299
01:21:16,970 --> 01:21:18,970
'He will save your boys'

1300
01:21:19,640 --> 01:21:24,700
Both sons were very fond of each other
They stick together like glue

1301
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:27,090
My eldest told me just last week

1302
01:21:27,140 --> 01:21:31,050
'Let my younger brother study
I'll find some job to support us'

1303
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:33,040
'A master was coming he said'

1304
01:21:33,180 --> 01:21:35,550
He was sure they will be rescued

1305
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:37,550
But no one came

1306
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:41,140
'My entire lineage has snapped'

1307
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:43,090
Hey! Where are you?

1308
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:44,550
Hurry up

1309
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:46,590
- 'Listen to him
- He will get wild

1310
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:47,890
You understood?

1311
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:50,640
- Yov! Come here - You can go

1312
01:21:52,470 --> 01:21:54,680
- Sir - Who are they?

1313
01:21:54,720 --> 01:21:57,050
She is that master's
colleague it seems

1314
01:21:57,090 --> 01:21:59,140
Pack them all off and
move that master to the cell

1315
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:00,260
Okay sir

1316
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:02,550
Hey! Clear the other cases
out of the station

1317
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:03,590
Okay sir

1318
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:09,340
You can never cry? Can you?

1319
01:22:09,390 --> 01:22:11,590
Your eyes won't tear up
till the day you die

1320
01:22:11,680 --> 01:22:13,580
Get even more sloshed

1321
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:14,640
'Why are you lamenting here?'

1322
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,510
Shut up now!

1323
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:20,180
Do I have to repeat myself?
Clear this place now madam

1324
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:21,590
Clear out

1325
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:22,840
Come with me sir

1326
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:24,590
I swear-

1327
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,620
Come along sir
Standing rooted to the spot

1328
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:29,156
I swear I didn't expect any of this

1329
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:32,140
Don't forget you are also responsible
for the death of those 2 boys

1330
01:22:32,180 --> 01:22:33,970
Convey my apologies to their mother

1331
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:36,510
You are taking undue advantage
of the respect I'm giving you

1332
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:38,720
Don't make me lose my temper
Stand right there

1333
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:42,080
I sacrificed my children
in such an awful unjust way

1334
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:43,460
'Hey! Come here'

1335
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,550
Sir light some repellent
Mosquitoes are biting

1336
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:54,890
Get in

1337
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,970
- 'You want a mosquito repellent!
- Don't hit it hurts'

1338
01:23:21,090 --> 01:23:22,800
Listen Bhavani

1339
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:26,930
Only you and I are left to contest
the Lorry Drivers' Union election

1340
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:28,680
I have to win unopposed

1341
01:23:28,720 --> 01:23:30,180
'Looks like it may rain'

1342
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,970
Can we have tea
and then discuss?

1343
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:42,220
[sniffles]

1344
01:23:59,260 --> 01:24:02,050
'Master my name is Shiva

1345
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:03,930
My elder brother is Mani

1346
01:24:03,970 --> 01:24:07,930
'He stole from a bakery for my sake
because I was starving'

1347
01:24:08,260 --> 01:24:12,340
'But they foisted some other case
on us and brought us here'

1348
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:14,550
'Everything is wrong here master'

1349
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,510
'They thrash us mercilessly'

1350
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:18,800
'They stuff some powder
into our mouths'

1351
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:22,970
'Immediately even our teeth
start shivering master'

1352
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,840
'Don't know if it is day or night'

1353
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:29,590
'We put up with all this
thinking it is for a short period'

1354
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:31,180
'Now when we are
about to be released'

1355
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:33,760
'...they want us to surrender
on some other murder case'

1356
01:24:34,140 --> 01:24:37,010
'Otherwise they are threatening
to kill our mother master'

1357
01:24:37,050 --> 01:24:41,430
Sister Charu assured us you will come
and be our savior rescue us'

1358
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:43,760
'Please save us master'

1359
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,280
'Our poor mother'

1360
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,960
'She is all alone'

1361
01:24:47,270 --> 01:24:49,970
'Crying nonstop daily'

1362
01:24:50,050 --> 01:24:51,890
'I can't cry anymore master'

1363
01:24:52,470 --> 01:24:54,100
Please save us

1364
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:57,840
Please save us somehow

1365
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,140
Go ahead

1366
01:25:19,900 --> 01:25:21,560
I told you Bhavani

1367
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,020
I want to win unopposed

1368
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:25,380
I called you here
to arrive at a compromise

1369
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:27,140
But still I can't trust you

1370
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:32,580
You'll take any kind of cruel measure
using those juvenile delinquents

1371
01:25:32,980 --> 01:25:38,760
Should I step out of my house daily
with fear in every breath I exhale?

1372
01:25:40,420 --> 01:25:42,050
That is why you called me

1373
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:44,760
Are you planning to kill me?

1374
01:25:46,360 --> 01:25:47,360
You

1375
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,620
You call someone
with a plan to kill him

1376
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:52,060
Treat him royally like a guest
and offer him hot tea

1377
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:55,480
You're the only man who
asked me for permission to kill

1378
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:57,480
Instead you could have-

1379
01:25:57,700 --> 01:26:02,680
Putting you on a pedestal I wanted to
fix an auspicious day to finish you off

1380
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:07,930
'Hey! Wait'

1381
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:09,460
I'll give you 2 minutes

1382
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,980
Kill me and then save
your men and yourself

1383
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:42,390
Do you need an army
to bash up 1 man?

1384
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:43,640
Open the door

1385
01:27:26,390 --> 01:27:28,160
Hey he is a master
You have 10 minutes time

1386
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,060
Finish him fast and come out

1387
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:33,120
Turn the other way

1388
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:37,120
Come Murali

1389
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:38,440
Locked it

1390
01:28:03,940 --> 01:28:06,930
Even if you are reborn
pray I don't set eyes on you!

1391
01:28:17,980 --> 01:28:22,940
Master my boss has
given you a bus ticket

1392
01:28:23,060 --> 01:28:25,340
'Luxury bus
Air-condition sleeper'

1393
01:28:25,520 --> 01:28:28,000
Leave tonight you'll reach
your hometown in the morning

1394
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,460
Got it into your head?

1395
01:28:30,550 --> 01:28:31,590
'If you stubbornly refuse'

1396
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:35,080
You saw the 2 boys
hanging from the roof?

1397
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:37,380
I'm talking to you

1398
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:39,220
Is that a love letter in your hand?

1399
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:44,050
Mani

1400
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:46,340
[reading under his breath]

1401
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,800
Refusing to surrender in the murder case
and ended up dead those 2 tramps-

1402
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:46,080
Kill him

1403
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,220
Sir?

1404
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:57,060
They will kill the master.
Please hurry up sir.

1405
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:03,180
'Open the door'

1406
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:07,100
Hey Surrender. Open the door.

1407
01:31:22,890 --> 01:31:24,470
'Open the door. Hey Surrender!

1408
01:31:44,840 --> 01:31:45,520
Speak

1409
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:49,400
Bhavani! Master....

1410
01:31:56,760 --> 01:31:58,460
Who are you?

1411
01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:01,320
Who is behind this?
What is your motive?

1412
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:05,660
Why do you use these innocent boys?
I don't know any of this

1413
01:32:05,940 --> 01:32:07,460
But I will find out

1414
01:32:07,660 --> 01:32:12,140
Crooks like you using these
little boys for crimes

1415
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:16,820
I will find out. I will search
and come before you

1416
01:32:22,380 --> 01:32:27,080
I will make you answer
for the death of those 2 boys

1417
01:32:28,520 --> 01:32:29,780
Master

1418
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:33,440
Whatever I'm about to say
is nothing new for you

1419
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:37,760
Still I'll say it
and you just listen

1420
01:32:39,940 --> 01:32:41,060
I'm waiting!

1421
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:45,320
[confident laughter]

1422
01:32:45,660 --> 01:32:48,680
Wait for me. I'm coming...

1423
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:11,080
Oh brother Das! He has come again.

1424
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,280
Is there no one to save me?'

1425
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:14,820
Say man! Hooo!

1426
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:17,570
If you encounter me
you'll be finished master

1427
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:20,570
If you cross our path you will go mad.

1428
01:33:20,610 --> 01:33:23,160
Master you've been staring
at the rope for a long time?

1429
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:24,940
Want to play on it as a swing?

1430
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,120
What song that?

1431
01:33:26,240 --> 01:33:28,240
Let me tell a 'Chitti' story

1432
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:30,120
Hey! Hey! Not 'Chitti'

1433
01:33:30,260 --> 01:33:31,110
Saaaad story!

1434
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:33,360
"Let me tell a sad story"

1435
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:35,990
"Zip lip or slip Skip and trip"

1436
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:37,990
"Chill my master!"

1437
01:33:40,240 --> 01:33:42,240
"Chill out master"

1438
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,700
Hey master!

1439
01:33:43,910 --> 01:33:46,160
Chill your beers!

1440
01:33:53,490 --> 01:33:56,530
'Youths to the youngest ones
are doped day and night bro'

1441
01:33:56,950 --> 01:33:59,700
'When they are intoxicated
they are not in control of their senses'

1442
01:33:59,740 --> 01:34:02,160
'Both have plenty of
criminal cases against them'

1443
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,060
'2 boys who died are sheer poison'

1444
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:05,980
'Both must have died
when totally tanked sir'

1445
01:34:06,120 --> 01:34:08,426
'They won't toe the line with
their parents or with our rules'

1446
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:10,450
They are arrogant boys
who insist their word is law

1447
01:34:10,490 --> 01:34:13,440
'There are 10-12 year olds
with all kinds of diseases in here'

1448
01:34:13,620 --> 01:34:14,480
All dazed and doped

1449
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,240
Who told you they were
good-for-nothing boys?

1450
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:19,260
Both are 24 carat gold sir

1451
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:20,950
Both those boys who died

1452
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,700
They called a girl I know
on the night they died

1453
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:24,910
You mean Charu?

1454
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:26,950
Yes Charu

1455
01:34:26,990 --> 01:34:30,280
I know Charu and I know
who killed those 2 boys too

1456
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:31,990
We have tried our level best

1457
01:34:32,030 --> 01:34:35,280
But we are unable to stop
the dope and booze supply

1458
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:38,160
How can drugs enter the premises
without your knowledge sir?

1459
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,280
They have so many routes
to supply sir

1460
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:44,240
Without the wardens' support

1461
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:46,116
'...nothing can be brought in sir'

1462
01:34:46,140 --> 01:34:49,800
As per our rule book no violence on
our boys who are all below 18 here

1463
01:34:49,940 --> 01:34:52,100
Using that as an excuse
they will bring the roof down!

1464
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:53,990
Presuming others' fears
are their plus

1465
01:34:54,030 --> 01:34:55,820
...these are riff-raffs
who rule the roost

1466
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:59,760
Poor chaps! Trapped for life
caught in Bhavani's web

1467
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,450
Who is Bhavani?

1468
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:03,070
Beast!

1469
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:05,950
- Bhava... Bhavani?
- Don't know anyone by that name

1470
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:12,910
Sir don't simply keep
asking questions

1471
01:35:13,030 --> 01:35:15,570
Got any other work
carry on okay?

1472
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:16,860
See you sir?

1473
01:35:16,910 --> 01:35:18,070
Let's go

1474
01:35:46,740 --> 01:35:48,900
'Teachers who came here earlier
to reform these boys'

1475
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:52,530
...would have made a hasty retreat
thinking their family takes priority

1476
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:55,490
But my story is completely different

1477
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:57,860
I have no one to call my own sir

1478
01:35:58,910 --> 01:36:03,110
'The day I saw those 2 boys
hang right in front of my eyes'

1479
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,320
Their eyes....

1480
01:36:06,100 --> 01:36:07,820
Tongues...

1481
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:10,530
I died sir

1482
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:15,200
If you can help me

1483
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:17,610
I will change everything here

1484
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:21,860
For this cause whatever strife
I don't care even if I lose my life

1485
01:36:22,340 --> 01:36:24,140
I'll do and show it.

1486
01:36:24,360 --> 01:36:28,040
If you do anything legally abiding
with rules and regulations,

1487
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:29,610
I will stand behind you sir

1488
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:40,616
"Since how long
have I been roaming."

1489
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:45,520
"Times are changing on the whole"

1490
01:36:56,420 --> 01:37:03,100
"My life says enough..."

1491
01:37:03,540 --> 01:37:04,760
Forgive me mother

1492
01:37:10,300 --> 01:37:14,570
"Quit liquor... Quit habit..."

1493
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:17,740
"Run him out...
Don't delay any further..."

1494
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:20,860
"Quit liquor... Quit habit..."

1495
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:24,990
"Quit liquor... Quit habit..."

1496
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:50,020
You got me wrong Bhavani

1497
01:37:50,220 --> 01:37:51,740
Ever since Gurumurthy died

1498
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:53,920
...everyone is scared
to contest for that post

1499
01:37:54,200 --> 01:37:56,100
I've spoken to the district councilor

1500
01:37:56,260 --> 01:37:57,110
In another 2 days

1501
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,240
...it will be announced
you won unopposed

1502
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:00,320
Come here

1503
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,160
Bro she is the cause of everything

1504
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:06,620
She registered the case it seems
Our boys sent her photo just now

1505
01:38:06,740 --> 01:38:07,680
What should we do with her?

1506
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:09,280
Can't you handle a girl?

1507
01:38:09,740 --> 01:38:12,450
As if you need a priest to choose
an auspicious time! Get lost!

1508
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:18,040
Bhavani even if someone else
occupies this post, he must listen to you

1509
01:38:18,180 --> 01:38:19,960
Then why do you aspire for this post?

1510
01:38:20,060 --> 01:38:22,180
Fear stemming out of murder
is short lived

1511
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:25,780
But fear derived from a post of power
and authority lasts a lifetime right?

1512
01:38:26,610 --> 01:38:28,530
After this I'm entering politics

1513
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:31,410
Don't know how many people
I have to kill there.

1514
01:38:31,450 --> 01:38:33,450
- Don't get it Bhavani
- All God's will

1515
01:38:33,490 --> 01:38:35,320
Our boys will shoulder the sin

1516
01:39:01,110 --> 01:39:02,570
"Commander"

1517
01:39:10,740 --> 01:39:12,110
"Commander"

1518
01:39:20,910 --> 01:39:21,950
Hey master!

1519
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:24,410
- 'Looking tip-top like a new groom?
- Correct man'

1520
01:39:24,450 --> 01:39:25,860
He looks different right?

1521
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:28,180
'Master is in a mood
to teach us a lesson'

1522
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:29,880
Do you think he's married?

1523
01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:31,200
'If he was married'

1524
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:32,450
And if his wife looks hot

1525
01:39:32,490 --> 01:39:34,240
Suuuper! Isn't it brother?

1526
01:39:34,820 --> 01:39:36,570
All of you stand height-wise

1527
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:39,300
Shorter ones in front

1528
01:39:39,460 --> 01:39:41,200
Taller ones in the back
Come on fast

1529
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:44,660
If you come clean shaven
you think we'll get scared?

1530
01:39:44,700 --> 01:39:48,440
- 'Move on to your next job
- At least pretend to be scared'

1531
01:39:48,640 --> 01:39:49,640
Poor master!

1532
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,070
Let me repeat

1533
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:52,410
Fall in line Stand height-wise

1534
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:56,980
Hey master! You can't change us
with height but can with strength

1535
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:58,580
This chap like a dunce

1536
01:39:58,720 --> 01:40:00,700
Pickpocket case
But he's a pipsqueak

1537
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,070
But our little black ant
had the guts to kill

1538
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:05,440
Cut above the rest
He is the heaviest of us all

1539
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:06,520
What is your name?

1540
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:09,030
You heard me? What is your name?

1541
01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:11,040
Master you can't lay a finger on us

1542
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:12,360
Know that right?

1543
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:15,410
Sir you can't lay a finger on the boys

1544
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:16,660
Rules

1545
01:40:17,360 --> 01:40:20,450
'Don't hit them and
get caught unnecessarily'

1546
01:40:20,990 --> 01:40:24,450
'Like a new starched shirt
sir is all stiff and spruced up'

1547
01:40:34,030 --> 01:40:36,240
It is wrong only
if I bash up the boys?

1548
01:40:36,280 --> 01:40:37,280
Yes, I told you that

1549
01:40:53,420 --> 01:40:56,720
What are you doing, why are you hitting?
You may be a master!

1550
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,200
You raise hands at us?
We are wardens here

1551
01:40:59,240 --> 01:41:01,700
We told you not to hit the boys
So you're beating us?

1552
01:41:01,740 --> 01:41:04,110
"Don't run over him and
look the other way"

1553
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,660
Don't beat him sir

1554
01:41:06,700 --> 01:41:09,490
Sir! Sir! Sir!

1555
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:11,530
It hurts sir Please don't hit

1556
01:41:11,570 --> 01:41:14,410
Sir I'm going to Sabarimala
I have taken vow of pilgrimage

1557
01:41:14,450 --> 01:41:17,860
Why? What happened to your devotion
when you were peddling drugs?

1558
01:41:43,610 --> 01:41:44,780
- Name?
- Bharath

1559
01:41:44,820 --> 01:41:46,070
Mallesh! Ram Pandu

1560
01:41:46,110 --> 01:41:47,256
Ramesh - Tamil

1561
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:47,355
- Sree Selam Ramesh -Tamil

1562
01:41:47,379 --> 01:41:48,280
- Sree Sailam

1563
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:49,320
Yadagiri

1564
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,700
Inspection! Everyone line up in a row

1565
01:43:11,380 --> 01:43:13,760
Bhavani! Master is creating
too many problems.

1566
01:43:14,200 --> 01:43:15,530
'He bashed up all the wardens'

1567
01:43:15,570 --> 01:43:18,660
'He raided the premises and burnt
all the drugs dopes and phones'

1568
01:43:18,950 --> 01:43:20,450
'What to do with him now?'

1569
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,360
How did a master muster
so much courage?

1570
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:33,780
Find out who is backing him up
Inquire about his background.

1571
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:38,440
Come! Let's go!

1572
01:44:01,780 --> 01:44:04,900
Hey love birds! Will you do the
work which we came for?

1573
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:08,280
Will you come?
What? Trapping the girl?

1574
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:17,180
Hey, leave me... leave me I say
I'm telling you, leave me I say

1575
01:44:17,450 --> 01:44:18,586
Remove your hands! Sir don't cut....

1576
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:20,450
Sir! Sir!

1577
01:44:24,450 --> 01:44:26,570
Master you had your way eh?

1578
01:44:26,610 --> 01:44:28,420
You can trim my hair
or tonsure my head

1579
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:30,910
Try your tricks on my leader Ulligadu!

1580
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:32,560
Hey Ulligadu! Listen to me'

1581
01:44:32,700 --> 01:44:34,356
- Don't go there go to your block
- Shut up warden

1582
01:44:34,380 --> 01:44:35,610
- Hello boss - Morning bro

1583
01:44:35,660 --> 01:44:37,740
Who had the guts to
lay a finger on our hair?

1584
01:44:37,780 --> 01:44:40,110
Is there a rule on
the long and short of it?

1585
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:42,490
Master do you know the rules or not?

1586
01:44:42,530 --> 01:44:44,660
You are having a free hand
with everyone's heads

1587
01:44:46,160 --> 01:44:47,410
Master

1588
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:48,910
Let go of me master

1589
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:54,400
You don't know whom
you're laying your hands on.

1590
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:55,920
You will regret what you're doing

1591
01:45:01,530 --> 01:45:03,160
Gosh! You're scaring me!

1592
01:45:03,610 --> 01:45:04,780
Hey Dheena

1593
01:45:04,820 --> 01:45:06,360
Crew cut!

1594
01:45:19,560 --> 01:45:20,560
You can go

1595
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:23,990
Next week will be
back to square one

1596
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:26,570
You can come back
and scrub it again okay?

1597
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:27,740
Bye sweetheart

1598
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:30,570
I've never seen such bad
nicotine stains at so young an age JD

1599
01:45:30,610 --> 01:45:32,700
Their mouths smell like filth

1600
01:45:32,740 --> 01:45:35,990
'I have collected cavity samples
from the 6 boys you mentioned'

1601
01:45:36,030 --> 01:45:38,700
- How long will it take?
- I'll let you know in 1 or 2 days

1602
01:45:38,740 --> 01:45:39,990
Thanks Madhu

1603
01:45:41,450 --> 01:45:43,660
He left me with a half shaved
mustache and beard

1604
01:45:43,700 --> 01:45:45,200
Such a disgrace!

1605
01:45:45,240 --> 01:45:46,910
I feel like I am naked!

1606
01:45:46,950 --> 01:45:48,320
I'm so mad I feel like...

1607
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:49,990
'I feel like stabbing him right now'

1608
01:45:50,030 --> 01:45:52,570
When you get your hands dirty
enemies will come and go

1609
01:45:52,610 --> 01:45:55,780
If we rage like a mad bull against every
single enemy our life will be ruined

1610
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,780
Handle him with patience

1611
01:45:57,820 --> 01:45:59,570
'Make him run in all 4 directions'

1612
01:45:59,610 --> 01:46:00,910
Don't let him sleep

1613
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,200
- Torture him mentally
- I'll tackle him

1614
01:46:03,240 --> 01:46:04,660
- 'Hey-' - You cut the call

1615
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:25,530
[overlap of angry voices]

1616
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:39,860
Hey! stop

1617
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:46,950
- What happened?
- Sir I don't know

1618
01:46:46,990 --> 01:46:48,820
They just started a brawl
and hit each other

1619
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:50,740
Back door is open in A block
What to do now?

1620
01:46:50,780 --> 01:46:51,860
Go look for the key

1621
01:46:54,700 --> 01:46:55,840
Don't let anyone out

1622
01:46:55,960 --> 01:46:57,450
- Lock them up in the class
- Okay bro

1623
01:46:57,490 --> 01:46:58,570
Give me the torch

1624
01:47:40,340 --> 01:47:41,320
Hello bro

1625
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,780
- 'Yes tell me'
- None of our boys are missing I hope

1626
01:47:43,820 --> 01:47:45,960
Bro head count is correct 63

1627
01:47:46,410 --> 01:47:48,280
'Not one of them is missing'

1628
01:47:48,950 --> 01:47:51,030
'They came from outside for sure'

1629
01:48:20,570 --> 01:48:22,240
Ohhh! Its burning....

1630
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:30,160
No brother You're hurting me

1631
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:36,030
What happened?

1632
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:38,160
What happened to you? Tell me!

1633
01:48:38,990 --> 01:48:41,860
Master they broke his hand

1634
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:44,910
Do something master

1635
01:48:45,280 --> 01:48:48,280
'Hit them at least once master'

1636
01:49:22,820 --> 01:49:25,610
Hey master! You had the gall
to shave half my mustache

1637
01:49:25,660 --> 01:49:27,910
That's why I knifed your body!

1638
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,570
This will go on everyday.

1639
01:49:29,610 --> 01:49:31,490
We will escape from here tonight

1640
01:49:31,530 --> 01:49:32,910
Try to stop us if you can

1641
01:49:46,240 --> 01:49:48,070
'I was on my bike
sticking to the kerb side'

1642
01:49:48,110 --> 01:49:51,320
Whether he collided by mistake
or deliberately targeted me

1643
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:52,780
'Only God knows'

1644
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:54,570
'But his intention is to provoke you'

1645
01:49:54,610 --> 01:49:57,820
Only then you'll get angry and show
your fist power on a handful of boys

1646
01:49:57,860 --> 01:50:00,740
'They will use that as excuse
and pack you off from here'

1647
01:50:00,780 --> 01:50:02,530
'Don't act rashly on impulse'

1648
01:50:04,110 --> 01:50:06,280
Only his leg is fractured
Hand is intact right?

1649
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:30,040
Sorry ra

1650
01:50:30,410 --> 01:50:32,410
I couldn't do anything to help you

1651
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:33,500
It's okay forget it

1652
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:35,080
What can you do?

1653
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:38,540
My fear is those grown up boys are
waiting to pounce on us in kabaddi

1654
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:41,660
And we have to play against
those beefy buffaloes it seems

1655
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:43,330
In case we lose...

1656
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:45,290
...we'll be 'banchans'
this entire month

1657
01:50:45,330 --> 01:50:46,540
'Banchan' means?

1658
01:50:46,580 --> 01:50:48,690
Being an errand boy

1659
01:50:48,770 --> 01:50:51,460
To be under their beck and call
Do all their dirty jobs like a slave

1660
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:53,000
I'll anyway lose

1661
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,936
'I am agreeable to being an 'banchan'
but they insist I should play master'

1662
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,910
I snitched to you right?

1663
01:50:57,960 --> 01:51:00,000
Using Kabaddi as an excuse
as if it's just a game

1664
01:51:00,040 --> 01:51:01,960
'...they plan to bash me up master'

1665
01:51:02,290 --> 01:51:03,580
'Hey hundi...!'

1666
01:51:04,410 --> 01:51:05,460
Come ra

1667
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:08,580
Look here

1668
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:09,620
Look at me

1669
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:10,830
'I am calling you... hey!'

1670
01:51:10,870 --> 01:51:13,210
Coming or shall I lift you
and bring you here to play?

1671
01:51:13,250 --> 01:51:15,160
More than the aches
from blows and kicks

1672
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:18,040
Pain from fear hurts deeper!

1673
01:51:18,290 --> 01:51:19,460
Go with courage ra

1674
01:51:20,330 --> 01:51:22,040
Go and check what he's doing

1675
01:51:22,120 --> 01:51:24,000
Das he is coming

1676
01:51:49,210 --> 01:51:50,250
Tell me Madhu

1677
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:52,210
You snitched about us
to the master right?

1678
01:51:52,330 --> 01:51:54,080
- Face us now - Hey!

1679
01:51:54,120 --> 01:51:55,620
I know very well ra

1680
01:51:55,660 --> 01:51:57,960
If Bawar plays we will win for sure

1681
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,370
So you got scared and
broke his hand right?

1682
01:52:00,410 --> 01:52:02,090
Had he been here
would he have defeated us?

1683
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:04,540
For sure then you would
have lost pathetically

1684
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,790
Call how many ever whomever
you want from here to play on your side

1685
01:52:07,830 --> 01:52:08,910
I'll call anyone I want

1686
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:10,436
But you shouldn't
go back on your word

1687
01:52:10,460 --> 01:52:13,410
Call we won't send you back
without breaking all your teeth today!

1688
01:52:15,960 --> 01:52:18,290
MAAASTER!

1689
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:21,660
"Clash of wills here"

1690
01:52:23,370 --> 01:52:25,250
"No one to face in arena"

1691
01:52:26,790 --> 01:52:28,620
"To win over him"

1692
01:52:30,540 --> 01:52:33,910
"Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi"

1693
01:52:33,960 --> 01:52:37,830
"Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi"

1694
01:52:45,120 --> 01:52:47,040
- Tell me Madhu
- 'I checked the results'

1695
01:52:47,080 --> 01:52:49,870
I am sure all 6 of them
are above 20 years of age

1696
01:52:53,250 --> 01:52:55,040
"Kabaddi... kabaddi... play"

1697
01:52:55,080 --> 01:52:58,870
"No one to face in arena"
"To win over him"

1698
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:01,750
"No one to face in arena"

1699
01:53:01,790 --> 01:53:03,080
What are you saying?

1700
01:53:03,460 --> 01:53:05,250
Not one of them is less than 18?

1701
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:07,710
100% sure in those 6 boys
no one is younger than 18

1702
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:28,000
Master at least do you know
the name of this game?

1703
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:30,080
'This is not cricket or football'

1704
01:53:30,120 --> 01:53:32,460
You must hold your breath and
repeat 'kabaddi' you know?

1705
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:35,620
Our rules are different

1706
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:37,210
You can't just touch and run

1707
01:53:37,540 --> 01:53:39,580
You must toss your opponent
outside the line

1708
01:53:39,620 --> 01:53:41,330
What... still want to play?

1709
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,120
Come on ra

1710
01:53:58,080 --> 01:54:01,500
Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi

1711
01:54:12,210 --> 01:54:14,120
Buddy, you're out if you
step out of the line

1712
01:54:14,160 --> 01:54:16,160
Kabaddi... kabaddi... ra!

1713
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:20,790
- Go back - Hold his hand

1714
01:54:20,830 --> 01:54:22,120
"No one to face in arena"

1715
01:54:25,710 --> 01:54:26,960
Das

1716
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:30,210
Bingo!

1717
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:38,080
Watch it!

1718
01:54:46,750 --> 01:54:47,910
Come on

1719
01:54:59,830 --> 01:55:01,660
Hey! He is hitting us real hard

1720
01:55:01,710 --> 01:55:03,040
Soooper master

1721
01:55:03,210 --> 01:55:04,870
Wait I'll go

1722
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:07,540
If you have the guts show it now

1723
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:09,910
Come... come on

1724
01:55:09,960 --> 01:55:12,330
Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi

1725
01:55:13,830 --> 01:55:16,330
Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi

1726
01:55:30,330 --> 01:55:33,120
- Hand... break his hand huh?
- Awww! It hurts

1727
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:35,370
Master you are hurting me

1728
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:38,830
[loud cheering]

1729
01:55:45,580 --> 01:55:47,870
'Come on now Show your strength'

1730
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:56,930
"No one to face in arena"
"To win over him"

1731
01:57:05,710 --> 01:57:07,460
Crossed the line

1732
01:57:09,410 --> 01:57:12,960
If you dare lay a finger
on these boys just once more

1733
01:57:18,120 --> 01:57:22,040
"Kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi... kabaddi!"

1734
01:57:22,790 --> 01:57:24,410
Master?

1735
01:57:24,750 --> 01:57:26,000
Master...?

1736
01:57:26,370 --> 01:57:28,370
- What?
- Is it okay to talk frankly?

1737
01:57:28,410 --> 01:57:30,830
- Camera is recording everything
- Go on doesn't matter

1738
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:32,160
I'll tell you master

1739
01:57:32,210 --> 01:57:34,210
My mother passed away
when I was born

1740
01:57:34,660 --> 01:57:36,750
My neighbor akka raised me

1741
01:57:37,410 --> 01:57:40,080
My father asked that sister
if she will sleep with him!

1742
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:41,790
That's why

1743
01:57:41,830 --> 01:57:43,870
I threw the grinding stone on his head

1744
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:46,580
Immediately the police put me in jail

1745
01:57:47,290 --> 01:57:49,580
'That's when I got
trapped with Das anna'

1746
01:57:49,710 --> 01:57:52,910
From then on I had to listen
only to what Das anna says

1747
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:56,250
Das anna will walk in

1748
01:57:56,290 --> 01:57:58,460
He will check who is addicted to drugs

1749
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,080
Powder smoke booze
He will increase the dosage

1750
01:58:03,410 --> 01:58:05,040
Which one of you here

1751
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:08,000
...has seen Bhavani?

1752
01:58:08,040 --> 01:58:09,250
Bhavani?

1753
01:58:09,620 --> 01:58:11,410
Where have I heard this name?

1754
01:58:11,460 --> 01:58:12,960
'Somehow sounds familiar'

1755
01:58:13,210 --> 01:58:14,250
Master

1756
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:17,620
We have heard this name
But none of us have seen him

1757
01:58:17,660 --> 01:58:19,910
Das anna is 'be all and end all' here

1758
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:21,710
'We must obey him implicitly'

1759
01:58:21,750 --> 01:58:24,460
'If he asks us to surrender
we should do so with our eyes closed'

1760
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:25,750
Otherwise we will be hanged

1761
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:27,410
'They recently hanged 2 boys'

1762
01:58:27,460 --> 01:58:28,910
'Didn't you see that master?'

1763
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:32,750
Do you all want to go home
and live with your family?

1764
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,620
Or do you want to surrender?

1765
01:58:34,790 --> 01:58:36,830
- Go home master
- Be with our family

1766
01:58:37,960 --> 01:58:39,830
You have been here for 10 days

1767
01:58:39,870 --> 01:58:42,080
We haven't taken to drugs till now

1768
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,160
Only now we know our own selves

1769
01:58:45,290 --> 01:58:47,580
Somehow save us from here master

1770
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:51,210
If you follow what I say you can
go home and live as you wish

1771
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:52,330
Will you do as I say?

1772
01:58:52,370 --> 01:58:54,620
- Yes master - We will

1773
01:58:54,660 --> 01:58:59,370
Whatever you shared with me now
will you tell the same to the magistrate?

1774
01:58:59,460 --> 01:59:01,410
Of course we will master

1775
01:59:01,460 --> 01:59:04,160
I'll arrange all the formalities
to get them out on parole

1776
01:59:04,210 --> 01:59:05,250
Thanks sir

1777
01:59:05,290 --> 01:59:07,410
Let the video evidence
be with Charu till then

1778
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:09,410
It will reach the magistrate
when you say so

1779
01:59:09,460 --> 01:59:12,910
Master you shot some video
and cleverly made us confess

1780
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,870
You haven't shared your story

1781
01:59:14,910 --> 01:59:16,250
Tell us Let's listen

1782
01:59:16,290 --> 01:59:17,410
'Ask him ra'

1783
01:59:17,460 --> 01:59:18,620
Are you chewing pan, huh?

1784
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:20,620
- Tell us - Tell us master

1785
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:22,160
'Please share your story master'

1786
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:24,000
We are asking right?
Please tell us

1787
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:26,710
Don't ask for trouble
Voice of experience!

1788
01:59:26,790 --> 01:59:28,710
Wait they are very eager to hear

1789
01:59:28,790 --> 01:59:30,370
I'll be happy to share
Let them enjoy

1790
01:59:30,410 --> 01:59:32,210
I was in college then

1791
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:34,040
'I think it was my final year'

1792
01:59:34,080 --> 01:59:36,870
A new teacher joined our college

1793
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:38,660
Her name was Sithara

1794
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:41,790
Unbelievable one in a million 'Love'

1795
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,870
All of a sudden that girl I loved

1796
01:59:49,620 --> 01:59:51,040
...met with an accident

1797
01:59:51,080 --> 01:59:52,620
'She forgot her past'

1798
01:59:52,660 --> 01:59:54,830
She didn't even know who I was

1799
01:59:55,250 --> 01:59:57,120
She even forgot my mad love for her

1800
01:59:57,660 --> 02:00:02,040
Fate made me attend her wedding
present a bouquet with my own hands!

1801
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:04,710
After that-

1802
02:00:05,710 --> 02:00:08,660
Hey! Why are all of you
sniffling and crying?

1803
02:00:08,750 --> 02:00:10,910
Now that girl has totally
forgotten our past

1804
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,410
Master isn't that teacher akka?

1805
02:00:13,460 --> 02:00:16,250
Hey this akka is teacher
working as my colleague now

1806
02:00:16,290 --> 02:00:18,080
That was my college time

1807
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:20,330
'Premam' Sithara teacher

1808
02:00:20,370 --> 02:00:22,370
Hey don't you watch love story films?

1809
02:00:22,460 --> 02:00:24,460
If I don't understand the language

1810
02:00:24,500 --> 02:00:25,580
- I won't watch - Okay

1811
02:00:25,620 --> 02:00:27,410

1813
02:00:29,710 --> 02:00:31,160
Okay master Bye master

1814
02:00:31,210 --> 02:00:35,000
How much longer will you quote a film story
if someone asks you about your past life?

1815
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,960
Fool yourself in the bargain
and trick others too?

1816
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,500
Which is a film story?

1817
02:00:39,960 --> 02:00:41,080
Don't act

1818
02:00:41,120 --> 02:00:42,960
What you narrated was
film 'Premam'

1819
02:00:43,080 --> 02:00:45,710
Copy cats! They stole my story
and it is released huh?

1820
02:00:45,960 --> 02:00:48,580
One track mind
on plagiarism huh?

1821
02:00:49,660 --> 02:00:52,290
Okay what do you want to know?

1822
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:53,370
Tell me

1823
02:00:53,410 --> 02:00:55,250
Why did you start drinking?

1824
02:00:56,660 --> 02:00:58,660
Every drunkard will have a story

1825
02:00:58,710 --> 02:00:59,830
Why go into it now?

1826
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,250
If I tell you my reason

1827
02:01:01,330 --> 02:01:04,710
...a handful of them
will follow my footsteps

1828
02:01:06,160 --> 02:01:07,870
Is that necessary?
Isn't it wrong?

1829
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:09,710
Okay... okay

1830
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:12,330
I won't tell you now
why I got into this habit

1831
02:01:12,870 --> 02:01:15,500
If you like I'll tell you
why I quit shall I?

1832
02:01:27,660 --> 02:01:32,910
"Beautiful are his gazes...
That plays love tunes..."

1833
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:38,410
"He came closer...
Changed my heart forever..."

1834
02:01:39,750 --> 02:01:43,250
"All of me... It's him...
It's him... Standing..."

1835
02:01:43,290 --> 02:01:48,580
"Walking... In dreams...
Never seen another face..."

1836
02:01:53,330 --> 02:01:56,620
"Modesty... It's him... It's him.."

1837
02:01:56,660 --> 02:02:00,790
"Moving like waves...
Smiles ooze beauty..."

1838
02:02:01,460 --> 02:02:04,250
"Flowery heart...
Standstill age..."

1839
02:02:04,290 --> 02:02:06,790
"I pity poor girls..."

1840
02:02:06,830 --> 02:02:09,620
"Glow of flowerpots...
Royal swag..."

1841
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:12,250
"Classy Master is mass..."

1842
02:02:12,290 --> 02:02:17,540
"Cracker look... A look is enough...
Failed heart too starts pulsating..."

1843
02:02:17,580 --> 02:02:20,960
"He's single, that's news...
This is good chance..."

1844
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:26,080
"Beautiful are his gazes...
That plays love tunes..."

1845
02:02:26,160 --> 02:02:31,210
"He came closer...
Changed my heart forever..."

1846
02:02:31,250 --> 02:02:33,120
JD is an orphan

1847
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:35,080
Just grew like a wild tree

1848
02:02:35,120 --> 02:02:36,750
Only after joining this college

1849
02:02:36,790 --> 02:02:38,290
'...he met a professor'

1850
02:02:38,330 --> 02:02:41,040
'His friendship and care
changed JD's life altogether'

1851
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:42,290
Professor Viswam!

1852
02:02:42,710 --> 02:02:44,750
But unfortunately he had a health issue

1853
02:02:44,790 --> 02:02:46,870
'He got admitted
in a hospital to get treated-'

1854
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,710
That really shattered JD

1855
02:02:48,750 --> 02:02:50,910
After that he was unable to sleep

1856
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:54,370
'That bloody alcohol took over him'

1857
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:02,790
"Walking... In dreams...
Never seen another face..."

1858
02:03:02,830 --> 02:03:10,830
"Modesty... It's him... It's him.." "Moving
like waves... Smiles ooze beauty..."

1859
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:16,080
"Flowery heart...
Standstill age..."

1860
02:03:16,120 --> 02:03:21,070
"Best friend... Man of words..."

1861
02:03:21,120 --> 02:03:22,870
"One of a kind...
Magnetic vision..."

1862
02:03:22,910 --> 02:03:24,960
"Sharp and smart..."

1863
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:28,960
"Always Master is top..."

1864
02:03:31,660 --> 02:03:37,080
"Always seen in him...
If he arrives solo..."

1865
02:03:37,120 --> 02:03:39,500
"Beautiful are his gazes...
That plays love tunes..."

1866
02:03:39,540 --> 02:03:40,870
What-?

1867
02:03:41,330 --> 02:03:42,750
Please move

1868
02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:50,510
Hey, go man.

'2 or 3 boys are chasing me'

1873
02:04:14,830 --> 02:04:17,210
Charu where are you? Which area?

1874
02:04:17,250 --> 02:04:19,290
In Kothapet Goddess Mother temple

1875
02:04:19,330 --> 02:04:21,160
Road opposite the temple

1876
02:04:27,080 --> 02:04:28,790
Charu?

1877
02:04:29,620 --> 02:04:30,870
Charu...?

1878
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:35,120
Hey... hey...

'They started chasing me when I was
on my way to the magistrate's house'

1880
02:04:52,580 --> 02:04:55,120
I don't know what to do
or where to go

1881
02:04:55,160 --> 02:04:56,620
Charu don't be scared

1882
02:04:56,660 --> 02:04:57,870
'I will send our boys'

1883
02:04:57,910 --> 02:05:00,710
Go inside some shop there

1884
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:02,250
'Enter a shop to be safe'

1885
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:09,620
- I've come into a shop sir
- Turn on the speaker

1886
02:05:09,660 --> 02:05:11,210

'Appreciate it if you can
hide this girl for a while'

1889
02:05:16,660 --> 02:05:18,000
I'll send my men please

My business will get affected
Don't involve me please leave

1891
02:05:21,040 --> 02:05:22,750

02:05:22,790 --> 02:05:24,210
'Speak boldly'

1893
02:05:24,330 --> 02:05:26,620

1897
02:05:53,290 --> 02:05:57,410
"How smooth your cheeks are"

1898
02:05:58,620 --> 02:06:03,120
"How tender the bud is"

1899
02:06:03,160 --> 02:06:06,040
[song 'Jagadekaveerudu Athilokasundari']

1900
02:06:06,660 --> 02:06:08,710
- Master they are teasing m-
- Sshhhhhhhhhh!

1901
02:06:15,410 --> 02:06:17,250
'I told you no one came in here'

1902
02:06:18,870 --> 02:06:20,620
'Bro where are you going in?'

1903
02:06:20,660 --> 02:06:21,620
'Listen'

1904
02:06:21,660 --> 02:06:23,460
'He already told you no one is here'

1905
02:06:23,500 --> 02:06:24,960
Oldie shut up

1906
02:06:33,750 --> 02:06:35,330
Give it of your own accord

1907
02:06:35,370 --> 02:06:37,160
Or else just 2 punches
I'll smash your face

1908
02:06:37,540 --> 02:06:39,040
If I have to grab it from you-

1909
02:06:39,080 --> 02:06:41,000
- I'll cut you into pieces.
- Come master

1910
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:42,620
This face looks familiar

1911
02:06:43,210 --> 02:06:44,460
'Akka'

1912
02:06:45,290 --> 02:06:48,630
'Turn your phone towards him'
- He's inside, let's go

1913
02:06:50,540 --> 02:06:51,620
Hey Bulliga...!

1914
02:06:51,660 --> 02:06:53,710
'Hey Mallesh my dear friend!'

1915
02:06:54,330 --> 02:06:55,410
Bulli ra

1916
02:06:55,460 --> 02:06:57,080
What are you doing
in this video call?

1917
02:06:57,120 --> 02:06:59,620
Hey, the girl you are chasing is my akka

1918
02:06:59,660 --> 02:07:01,250
- 'Your sister?
- Yes'

1919
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:03,370
I didn't know that

1920
02:07:03,410 --> 02:07:06,290
I was asked to finish her
That's way I chased her

1921
02:07:06,330 --> 02:07:08,080
But tell me why are you chasing her?

1922
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:11,500
- What is that?
- She has a camera

1923
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:14,080
I believe she has a camera

1924
02:07:14,120 --> 02:07:16,410
Ask her to give it
and we'll leave

1925
02:07:16,460 --> 02:07:18,660
Akka give him what he wants

1926
02:07:18,710 --> 02:07:20,290
We will deal with this differently

1927
02:07:20,330 --> 02:07:21,540
'Okay?'

1928
02:07:21,960 --> 02:07:23,120
'Just give it akka'

1929
02:07:32,080 --> 02:07:33,080
'Hey Mallesh'

1930
02:07:33,710 --> 02:07:35,870
I told you she's my sister
I didn't hear your apology?

1931
02:07:35,910 --> 02:07:37,660
- Apologize to her - Sorry akka

1932
02:07:37,710 --> 02:07:39,250
'Hey! You boys too'

1933
02:07:39,290 --> 02:07:40,540
Sorry akka

1934
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:42,580
Glad you are that scared of me!

1935
02:07:42,620 --> 02:07:45,120
Master end of incident
Akka safe from any accident

1936
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:47,040
You talk to her I'll wait there

1937
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:50,250
Charu leave that place immediately

1938
02:07:50,370 --> 02:07:53,750
"Play band and enjoy to the hilt"

1939
02:07:53,790 --> 02:07:57,660
"Take a knife and cut his head"

1940
02:07:57,710 --> 02:08:01,830
"Keep a blade ready and give a pose"

1941
02:08:02,120 --> 02:08:04,120
Hey, what's happening?

1942
02:08:04,660 --> 02:08:06,250
Who are you all?

1943
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:07,620
Look

1944
02:08:08,710 --> 02:08:10,120
What is this tattoo?

1945
02:08:10,250 --> 02:08:11,410
This branding?

1946
02:08:11,460 --> 02:08:12,960
When boys are sent to this Home

1947
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:16,040
Das anna will pick up
the sharp ones and train us

1948
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:19,370
When we get released he will tattoo
our hand like this

1949
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:22,620
If we show this tattoo in the Mess
we can eat to our stomach's content

1950
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:25,080
If you are older you'll get
plenty of booze and cigarettes

1951
02:08:25,120 --> 02:08:27,370
You can get clothes for free
from their textile shop

1952
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:30,080
They will even get you
dope from a pharmacy

1953
02:08:30,160 --> 02:08:32,080
But the hitch is

1954
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,500
Every now and then they will
make us surrender for a crime

1955
02:08:36,540 --> 02:08:38,790
Not to get back into the old
bad ways I'm staying aloof

1956
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:46,580
'We have heard this name
But none of us have seen him'

1957
02:08:46,750 --> 02:08:49,040
'Das anna is 'be all and end all' here'

1958
02:08:49,080 --> 02:08:50,790
'We must obey him implicitly'

1959
02:08:50,830 --> 02:08:53,120
- Is it a newly released film?
- 'No one can defy him'

1960
02:08:53,250 --> 02:08:55,540
'He asks you to surrender
we should with our eyes closed'

1961
02:08:55,580 --> 02:08:57,000
How did you lose track of her?

1962
02:08:57,080 --> 02:08:59,620
Don't know how Bhavani
I sent only professionals

1963
02:08:59,660 --> 02:09:01,120
Somehow they messed up-

1964
02:09:04,460 --> 02:09:06,250
What do we do with this bro?

1965
02:09:06,290 --> 02:09:10,250
It has a card inside which stores
whatever we shoot or click

1966
02:09:10,330 --> 02:09:13,540
Break that card alone and
keep the camera at my place

1967
02:09:13,910 --> 02:09:14,910
Okay

1968
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:16,790
When are they announcing the results?

1969
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:18,710
Heard it's Monday or Tuesday

1970
02:09:18,750 --> 02:09:20,460
You'll anyway win unopposed

1971
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:22,040
Why should you be tense?

1972
02:09:22,500 --> 02:09:24,660
- I can enjoy right?
- Yes then what?

1973
02:09:27,580 --> 02:09:28,620
Sit here

1974
02:09:31,580 --> 02:09:32,910
Do you know this ostrich?

1975
02:09:33,830 --> 02:09:36,120
A bird with a long neck like this

1976
02:09:36,160 --> 02:09:38,160
Have you seen its egg?
It will be this big

1977
02:09:38,660 --> 02:09:40,500
So big in size

1978
02:09:41,160 --> 02:09:43,910
But only that ostrich will know
the pain of hatching such an egg!

1979
02:09:45,210 --> 02:09:47,460
Will you sit here even after
I've explained to you?

1980
02:09:47,500 --> 02:09:48,620
No brother

1981
02:09:49,040 --> 02:09:50,660
- Get lost!
- Sorry, brother

1982
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:53,960
Bhavani boys want a booze party

1983
02:09:54,040 --> 02:09:55,500
You won't anyway drink

1984
02:09:55,540 --> 02:09:56,960
At least for them-

1985
02:09:58,250 --> 02:09:59,790
Drink to dig your own grave

1986
02:10:00,370 --> 02:10:01,960
- Go ahead
- Thanks a lot Bhavani

1987
02:10:04,210 --> 02:10:05,330
Goodnight

1988
02:10:09,290 --> 02:10:11,120
Somehow you made me
show you this place

1989
02:10:11,540 --> 02:10:13,660
I was staying away
from this place

1990
02:10:13,710 --> 02:10:15,160
Let's go back master

1991
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:17,870
Wait I have a good reason

1992
02:10:18,210 --> 02:10:19,210
We'll go soon

1993
02:10:19,250 --> 02:10:21,750
'Right you haven't come here to eat'

1994
02:10:26,290 --> 02:10:29,250
I thought you were inviting me
for a candle light dinner

1995
02:10:29,290 --> 02:10:31,250
Last time I came here
there was no power

1996
02:10:31,290 --> 02:10:32,750
They had lit only candles

1997
02:10:34,910 --> 02:10:36,580
Okay relax

1998
02:10:37,620 --> 02:10:39,250
Don't look at this place

1999
02:10:39,660 --> 02:10:41,830
I heard the food here is super

2000
02:10:42,960 --> 02:10:44,410
'Get a token for the meals'

2001
02:10:45,210 --> 02:10:46,580
'Madam you too'

2002
02:10:47,410 --> 02:10:49,080
I thought we'll have some privacy

2003
02:10:49,120 --> 02:10:52,790
Close your eyes and
show me your right hand

2004
02:10:53,620 --> 02:10:55,370
- Why?
- Show I'll tell you

2005
02:10:59,080 --> 02:11:01,660
You shouldn't open your eyes
till I tell you

2006
02:11:04,460 --> 02:11:05,540
'Open now'

2007
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:11,540
That boy's hand in the saloon
had this same mark

2008
02:11:11,580 --> 02:11:12,870
Show this over there

2009
02:11:13,540 --> 02:11:15,210
Ask for 'meals' token

2010
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:18,460
Why should I-

2011
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:20,370
All for a good reason
Go and show your hand

2012
02:12:14,870 --> 02:12:17,000
'We don't differentiate or discriminate'

2013
02:12:18,080 --> 02:12:20,580
'Whoever has that tattoo
on their hands...'

2014
02:12:20,620 --> 02:12:22,870
...we give them whatever they ask

2015
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:27,910
Bhavani's boys will take care of the rest

2016
02:12:39,460 --> 02:12:40,910
What is this for?

2017
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:42,870
Still some balance left
in the bucket list!

2018
02:13:04,370 --> 02:13:09,580
"Start a tradition...
Announce beating thigh..."

2019
02:13:09,620 --> 02:13:14,660
"Buddy, march ahead...
Beacon has arrived..."

2020
02:13:14,750 --> 02:13:19,620
"Let dust fly away...
When you play drums..."

2021
02:13:19,660 --> 02:13:23,370
"Nerves must shiver...
When you band it hard..."

2022
02:13:23,460 --> 02:13:24,540
"Beat it"

2023
02:13:25,040 --> 02:13:29,540
"Till new dawn breaks...
Rock it all the way..."

2024
02:13:29,580 --> 02:13:34,540
"Till you reach finish line...
Don't play half heartedly.."

2025
02:13:34,620 --> 02:13:38,410
"Here comes God who can
give death to Lord Yama..."

2026
02:13:38,460 --> 02:13:39,460
"Hey, bro..."

2027
02:13:39,500 --> 02:13:43,210
"No where seen God has
come before us..."

2028
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,870
"Combing streets and corners...
Never search for anything..."

2029
02:13:48,910 --> 02:13:53,160
"Not brave enough
to go against anyone..."

2030
02:13:53,210 --> 02:13:54,250
'Bhavani!'

2031
02:14:07,960 --> 02:14:11,000
That master is churning in my mind

2032
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,460
Tell him to kill that master
tomorrow before day break

2033
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:17,580
Why wait till tomorrow morning?
We can close his chapter right now

2034
02:14:20,290 --> 02:14:22,000
Shut your gob Just do what I say

2035
02:14:24,750 --> 02:14:25,790
Careful booze da

2036
02:14:25,830 --> 02:14:30,080
"Clenched fists are playing tabala...
Breaking it..."

2037
02:14:30,210 --> 02:14:34,660
"Who is playing it?
We can judge with the sound of finger..."

2038
02:14:38,710 --> 02:14:39,790
'Bhavani!'

2039
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:45,120
"Clenched fists are playing tabala...
Breaking it..."

2040
02:14:45,160 --> 02:14:49,580
"Who is playing it?
We can judge with the sound of finger..."

2041
02:14:49,620 --> 02:14:53,910
"Breaking open chest timber of soil...
He has come..."

2042
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:58,330
"Man to break your backs...
Man to rip out your skin is here..."

2043
02:14:58,540 --> 02:14:59,790
'Master...!'

2044
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:14,290
"Start a tradition...
Announce beating thigh..."

2045
02:15:14,410 --> 02:15:19,250
"Buddy, march ahead...
Beacon has arrived..."

2046
02:15:19,330 --> 02:15:24,790
"Let dust fly away...
When you play drums..."

2047
02:15:24,830 --> 02:15:28,160
"Nerves must shiver...
When you band it hard..."

2048
02:15:28,250 --> 02:15:29,660
"Beat it"

2049
02:15:29,710 --> 02:15:34,750
"Till new dawn breaks...
Rock it all the way..."

2050
02:15:34,790 --> 02:15:36,210
Give me Sugar pack if you have

2051
02:15:36,910 --> 02:15:38,410
I don't stock drugs

2052
02:15:39,460 --> 02:15:43,160
"Here comes God who can
give death to Lord Yama..."

2053
02:15:43,210 --> 02:15:44,250
'Hey boy'

2054
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:48,830
"No where seen God has
come before us..."

2055
02:16:19,660 --> 02:16:23,780
Forward all the videos
to the police department

2056
02:16:23,910 --> 02:16:27,490
I'll bring the boys
to the Magistrate directly

2057
02:16:27,580 --> 02:16:28,620
Okay

2058
02:16:30,290 --> 02:16:31,450
Master

2059
02:16:31,990 --> 02:16:33,830
This is Bhavani anna's truck

2060
02:16:33,950 --> 02:16:36,580
I've heard he comes here often

2061
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:39,240
Let's go there

2062
02:16:39,290 --> 02:16:41,830
Aiyaiyo! Are you joking master?

2063
02:16:41,870 --> 02:16:44,290
I am not coming
You go if you want

2064
02:17:29,410 --> 02:17:31,580
You make sound I'll stab you

2065
02:17:31,740 --> 02:17:32,790
Go

2066
02:17:37,540 --> 02:17:39,780
[incessant chatter]

2067
02:17:42,950 --> 02:17:43,990
Knock ra

2068
02:17:48,330 --> 02:17:49,620
To top it all a secret code!

2069
02:17:55,910 --> 02:17:58,200
If any hand reaches out to his weapon

2070
02:17:58,910 --> 02:18:00,240
He will end up a corpse

2071
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:01,990
- Switch off the damn song
- Kneel man

2072
02:18:02,580 --> 02:18:04,410
- Switch it off!
- Kneel down

2073
02:18:10,490 --> 02:18:11,990
Who is Bhavani here?

2074
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:14,160
Huh?

2075
02:18:15,080 --> 02:18:16,950
Which one of you here
has seen Bhavani?

2076
02:18:33,330 --> 02:18:35,120
What kind of sissy name
is that... Bhavani?

2077
02:18:35,540 --> 02:18:37,780
Was he lying on his stomach
as a baby when he was named?

2078
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:43,950
Shabaa!

2079
02:18:44,910 --> 02:18:46,740
Let me make it clear once more

2080
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:50,790
If any of you do something stupid
trying to retaliate

2081
02:18:51,540 --> 02:18:54,160
I'll sign on your man's
Adam's apple, got it?

2082
02:18:54,580 --> 02:18:56,490
'Try your luck flinging another bottle?'

2083
02:18:56,790 --> 02:18:58,160
That means

2084
02:18:58,580 --> 02:19:01,370
You know Bhavani very well

2085
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:06,040
Will you go and repeat this
to him verbatim?

2086
02:19:07,240 --> 02:19:08,790
Bhavani... Bhavani

2087
02:19:09,950 --> 02:19:11,660
Bhavani... Bhavani

2088
02:19:13,370 --> 02:19:15,990
A man walked in right royally
knowing it is your den Bhavani

2089
02:19:17,290 --> 02:19:18,660
Repeat ra

2090
02:19:18,910 --> 02:19:20,740
No you tell me I'll convey it

2091
02:19:20,780 --> 02:19:23,330
No you are scared

2092
02:19:24,450 --> 02:19:26,950
'Listen I might as well tell all of you'

2093
02:19:26,990 --> 02:19:30,120
The day you killed those 2 boys in
the Observation Home and hung them

2094
02:19:30,160 --> 02:19:31,830
I hung my head in guilt and died

2095
02:19:32,490 --> 02:19:34,620
I'm least bothered about myself hereafter

2096
02:19:35,620 --> 02:19:38,740
Branding those juveniles with a tattoo
and making them do your dirty work

2097
02:19:38,780 --> 02:19:39,990
I've put a full stop to it

2098
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:43,950
From now on anyone wants to do anything
using the boys as lambs for the slaughter

2099
02:19:43,990 --> 02:19:46,780
...has to kill me and then go ahead
but that has a slight hitch

2100
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:51,700
I will kill minimum 10 of you
and only then breathe my last

2101
02:19:52,700 --> 02:19:55,870
Be it Bhavani or Bhanumathi!!!

2102
02:19:57,540 --> 02:19:59,370
Will you go and tell him
word by word?

2103
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:01,540
Come get up

2104
02:20:06,870 --> 02:20:08,120
Close the door

2105
02:20:25,450 --> 02:20:27,120
Who threw that bottle at me ra?

2106
02:20:29,620 --> 02:20:30,740
Come here

2107
02:20:30,780 --> 02:20:32,120
No Bhavani

2108
02:20:32,160 --> 02:20:34,160
I aimed it at him

2109
02:20:34,200 --> 02:20:36,830
The pen will fall down and
you can escape I thought

2110
02:20:36,910 --> 02:20:38,290
'But it missed and-'

2111
02:20:38,490 --> 02:20:40,490
Hey! Lazy lout Open the door

2112
02:20:40,540 --> 02:20:41,660
'Open the door'

2113
02:20:41,700 --> 02:20:43,950
Attacks brother in our presence

2114
02:20:43,990 --> 02:20:46,040
Son of a gun! Open it damn you!

2115
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:48,636
If you're a man, open it

2116
02:20:48,660 --> 02:20:51,700
'Hey! Open... open it I say

2117
02:20:51,780 --> 02:20:52,940
- Hey, Bikshapathi - Come now

2118
02:20:52,990 --> 02:20:54,830
- Hey Bhikshapathi - Eh?

2119
02:20:54,950 --> 02:20:56,580
Bro is calling you

2120
02:20:56,700 --> 02:20:57,780
Come here

2121
02:20:59,450 --> 02:21:02,160
- Why did you go up?
- He locked us in

2122
02:21:02,370 --> 02:21:04,516
He was holding a knife
to my neck for an hour

2123
02:21:04,540 --> 02:21:05,910
WTH were you doing then?

2124
02:21:05,950 --> 02:21:08,120
Bhavani that wasn't a knife

2125
02:21:08,410 --> 02:21:10,790
- It was a pen
- You knew it huh?

2126
02:21:10,830 --> 02:21:13,660
How will he open the door
if you yell after he has gone?

2127
02:21:13,700 --> 02:21:15,176
Shall we pen him a letter?

2128
02:21:15,200 --> 02:21:16,790
'Sir please open the door'

2129
02:21:20,240 --> 02:21:21,790
Don't hit me Bhavani

2130
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:29,990
Who can draw very well here?

2131
02:21:30,040 --> 02:21:31,700
Master he is our best artist

2132
02:21:31,740 --> 02:21:34,950
He's the madcap who doodles foul stuff
all over the toilet and the walls master

2133
02:21:37,160 --> 02:21:38,160
'Hi master'

2134
02:21:38,200 --> 02:21:39,740
I believe you came to my den

2135
02:21:39,790 --> 02:21:43,080
Threatened a man with a pen and
conveyed an important message to Bhavani

2136
02:21:43,160 --> 02:21:44,620
I am that Bhavani

2137
02:21:44,740 --> 02:21:45,766
'Greetings'

2138
02:21:45,790 --> 02:21:50,370
If you destroy all that I own
textile shop hotel wine shop

2139
02:21:50,910 --> 02:21:54,290
What the hell will he do?
He is himself a criminal

2140
02:21:54,330 --> 02:21:56,580
'You assumed I won't
go to the police right?'

2141
02:21:56,620 --> 02:21:58,490
Your assumption is 100% right

2142
02:21:58,540 --> 02:22:00,386
But thinking you'll make
an ass of me was wrong

2143
02:22:00,410 --> 02:22:01,790
'I enquired about you'

2144
02:22:01,830 --> 02:22:04,490
I believe you have a big gang
of ardent fan followers

2145
02:22:04,580 --> 02:22:07,306
'Which one of them can I finish off?
I asked my boys their choice'

2146
02:22:07,330 --> 02:22:10,740
They said we can have a jolly time
killing them all without discrimination

2147
02:22:10,790 --> 02:22:13,620
'I will give you a 'Things to do'
Take a pen and paper'

2148
02:22:13,660 --> 02:22:17,660
List out your favorites
in alphabetical order

2149
02:22:17,700 --> 02:22:18,886
Bha... Bhavani!

2150
02:22:18,910 --> 02:22:21,830
Don't ignore girls and kids
thinking I'll be soft on them

2151
02:22:21,870 --> 02:22:23,950
Include their names too definitely

2152
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:26,160
'Write and call each one of them'

2153
02:22:26,330 --> 02:22:28,370
And then... master?

2154
02:22:28,660 --> 02:22:29,740
Bro...?

2155
02:22:29,780 --> 02:22:31,990
- Give me the phone
- 'Hello...?'

2156
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:34,926
- Why did he hang up on me?
- 'Must have got scared'

2157
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:36,160
Got very emotional I guess

2158
02:22:37,160 --> 02:22:40,160
Why he is getting hyper for no reason?

2159
02:22:40,330 --> 02:22:41,450
Here bro

2160
02:22:41,490 --> 02:22:43,240
What has happened huh?

2161
02:22:45,540 --> 02:22:47,870
Pick... pick... pick up my call

2162
02:22:52,910 --> 02:22:54,136
Pick up

2163
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:55,450
- Hi dude - Where are you?

2164
02:22:55,540 --> 02:22:56,806
I'm just leaving my office

2165
02:22:56,830 --> 02:22:58,596
- You are safe?
- Yes what's the problem?

2166
02:22:58,620 --> 02:23:00,410
'Listen to me Don't step out'

2167
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:02,160
What is the proble-

2168
02:23:02,910 --> 02:23:04,450
Come on pick up

2169
02:23:05,040 --> 02:23:06,330
- Sir?
- WHERE ARE YOU?

2170
02:23:06,370 --> 02:23:07,846
- Shut up-
- 'I hope you're safe?'

2171
02:23:07,870 --> 02:23:09,540
- 'Yes sir what happened?'
- Listen

2172
02:23:09,660 --> 02:23:12,426
Check if our batch students
are safe okay?

2173
02:23:12,450 --> 02:23:13,870
'Madhu where is he?'

2174
02:23:13,910 --> 02:23:14,926
'He is here JD'

2175
02:23:14,950 --> 02:23:16,766
- What is it?
- 'Stay at home don't go out'

2176
02:23:16,790 --> 02:23:17,830
'Everything safe?'

2177
02:23:17,870 --> 02:23:18,966
JD called me

2178
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:20,450
'He was so hassled'

2179
02:23:20,490 --> 02:23:22,240
'He told us not to step out'

2180
02:23:22,290 --> 02:23:25,160
Guys don't step out of your house
Most important avoid road travel

2181
02:23:25,200 --> 02:23:28,910
'In case you are out go to any house
or shop nearby or any safe place'

2182
02:23:28,950 --> 02:23:31,410
'JD sir called just now
I think there's a major problem'

2183
02:23:31,490 --> 02:23:32,790
'If you are safe'

2184
02:23:32,830 --> 02:23:34,846
For heaven's sake
text our entire group

2185
02:23:34,870 --> 02:23:35,990
Park the bike

2186
02:23:39,370 --> 02:23:41,766
'Almost everyone in the group
texted they are safe'

2187
02:23:41,790 --> 02:23:44,580
But we couldn't reach
only Bhargav and Savitha sir

2188
02:23:44,620 --> 02:23:46,160
Don't swerve too much to the right

2189
02:23:46,780 --> 02:23:48,120
Careful!

2190
02:23:51,580 --> 02:23:52,676
Hello?

2191
02:23:52,700 --> 02:23:53,780
I am safe-

2192
02:23:56,540 --> 02:23:57,740
Vanitha where are you?

2193
02:23:57,780 --> 02:23:59,330
In a mall nearby What happened?

2194
02:23:59,370 --> 02:24:01,136
- Is he with you?
- 'Yes ra'

2195
02:24:01,160 --> 02:24:03,120
He has gone to fetch
my purse from the car-

2196
02:24:04,990 --> 02:24:05,990
'VANITHA WHAT HAPPENED?'

2197
02:24:06,040 --> 02:24:07,490
'What happened Vanitha?'

2198
02:24:07,580 --> 02:24:09,580
'Vanitha talk to me
What is the mat-'

2199
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:12,330
VANITHA

2200
02:24:12,870 --> 02:24:14,990
- 'Where are you ra?'
- Theater why sir?

2201
02:24:15,080 --> 02:24:16,466
- Are you alright?
- What happened?

2202
02:24:16,490 --> 02:24:17,660
SRI...!

2203
02:24:17,740 --> 02:24:18,830
SRI REI!

2204
02:24:19,950 --> 02:24:20,990
SRI!

2205
02:24:22,290 --> 02:24:23,330
Hey!

2206
02:24:24,330 --> 02:24:25,766
Hey! Get out

2207
02:24:25,790 --> 02:24:27,636
- What happened?
- Savitha go

2208
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:28,990
'Bhargav'

2209
02:24:29,040 --> 02:24:31,240
BHARGAV!

2210
02:24:31,330 --> 02:24:32,620
'Bhargav...!'

2211
02:24:32,830 --> 02:24:33,990
' SIR!'

2212
02:24:36,490 --> 02:24:37,790
Sir...!

2213
02:24:39,790 --> 02:24:42,740
Bhargav is dead sir

2214
02:25:00,120 --> 02:25:02,240
[anguished cries]

2215
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:16,620
Master

2216
02:25:16,990 --> 02:25:18,370
How many wickets down?

2217
02:25:18,740 --> 02:25:20,040
'According to the News I got'

2218
02:25:20,080 --> 02:25:21,780
2 wickets down 2 retired hurt

2219
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:25,870
If you are still stubborn enough
to hang out with that gang

2220
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:27,740
...you'll lose 4 wickets daily

2221
02:25:27,780 --> 02:25:30,740
'I have never forgiven anyone
who has crossed my path till now'

2222
02:25:30,780 --> 02:25:32,870
This is my first time
and I am forgiving you

2223
02:25:33,160 --> 02:25:36,580
Just quit your job do an 'about turn'
and disappear from this town

2224
02:25:37,240 --> 02:25:40,080
'Otherwise one who escaped today
will die tomorrow and repeat'

2225
02:25:40,160 --> 02:25:41,806
It will go on repeat mode

2226
02:25:41,830 --> 02:25:44,200
They will keep falling like ninepins
Thank you and good bye

2227
02:25:44,410 --> 02:25:46,040
Hey... hey! Master... master

2228
02:25:46,080 --> 02:25:48,240
'The main reason I called you'

2229
02:25:48,290 --> 02:25:50,450
I didn't lie face down
when I was named it seems

2230
02:25:50,830 --> 02:25:52,426
I was on my back
it was clear as a bell!

2231
02:25:52,450 --> 02:25:53,660
- Hey - 'Aahn'

2232
02:25:53,700 --> 02:25:54,716
- REI!
- 'Hahn?'

2233
02:25:54,740 --> 02:25:55,766
Son of a gun!

2234
02:25:55,790 --> 02:25:56,790
Junk of a jerk!

2235
02:25:56,830 --> 02:25:59,290
I'll dice you dry and
pickle you to pieces

2236
02:25:59,910 --> 02:26:01,040
Thank you Goodbye

2237
02:26:05,870 --> 02:26:08,596
Take care of them just for today

2238
02:26:08,620 --> 02:26:09,740
I'll be back soon

2239
02:26:09,780 --> 02:26:10,966
Don't worry you go

2240
02:26:10,990 --> 02:26:12,910
'I will ensure the safety of these boys'

2241
02:26:16,740 --> 02:26:19,410
- Aiyo! Let go of me bro
- Shut up get into the truck

2242
02:26:19,490 --> 02:26:21,200
- Bro let go of me - Hit you

2243
02:26:21,240 --> 02:26:22,540
Where are you taking me?

2244
02:26:22,580 --> 02:26:24,700
- Leave me bro - Get in!

2245
02:26:24,990 --> 02:26:26,830
- I won't come let me be
- Hey! Get in

2246
02:26:26,870 --> 02:26:28,450
Hey, come!

2247
02:26:28,490 --> 02:26:30,450
- Lift him - Don't force me bro

2248
02:26:30,490 --> 02:26:31,990
- No... no - Listen to me

2249
02:26:32,040 --> 02:26:33,926
Dasu... Dasu

2250
02:26:33,950 --> 02:26:35,040
Don't do this Das

2251
02:26:35,080 --> 02:26:36,790
Leave them... poor kids

2252
02:26:54,950 --> 02:26:57,410
'Hello sir
I'm Venkat Rao speaking'

2253
02:26:57,490 --> 02:27:00,040
'Das and his boys beat us badly'

2254
02:27:00,080 --> 02:27:01,870
'He has taken the boys
who turned approvers'

2255
02:27:01,910 --> 02:27:03,450
'In a truck somewhere sir'

2256
02:27:03,490 --> 02:27:06,160
'We don't know what to do
Please come soon sir'

2257
02:27:23,120 --> 02:27:24,740
Yes Vanitha

2258
02:27:37,240 --> 02:27:39,830
'This is not new to me'

2259
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:42,990
You have gone out of your way
for these boys enough

2260
02:27:43,160 --> 02:27:46,790
'I have informed the higher authorities
They said they will be here soon'

2261
02:27:56,490 --> 02:28:00,160
I don't care two hoots
about the repercussion

2262
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:02,886
I'll take full blame
Beat the hell out of them

2263
02:28:02,910 --> 02:28:03,910
Hold this

2264
02:28:15,790 --> 02:28:17,120
Master... master ra

2265
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:18,620
Bad penny back again huh?

2266
02:28:21,700 --> 02:28:22,990
Plan to hit us?

2267
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:24,160
Go ahead

2268
02:28:31,490 --> 02:28:32,740
Come here

2269
02:28:33,780 --> 02:28:36,040
Think you've achieved
something great in life

2270
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:38,950
Come on laugh

2271
02:28:40,240 --> 02:28:41,330
You-

2272
02:28:42,780 --> 02:28:44,120
Bhargav

2273
02:28:45,080 --> 02:28:46,620
He is dead ra

2274
02:28:51,790 --> 02:28:54,870
Bhargav created much more trouble
in college than all of you put together

2275
02:28:55,290 --> 02:28:56,490
He is dead now

2276
02:28:56,790 --> 02:29:02,080
If a real rowdy reforms and just when
he wants to lead a good life if he dies-

2277
02:29:02,120 --> 02:29:04,040
Do you know it is
the height of cruelty?

2278
02:29:04,490 --> 02:29:07,370
The faith people around him have
to turn over a new leaf will vanish

2279
02:29:07,410 --> 02:29:08,790
Oh my gawd!

2280
02:29:08,870 --> 02:29:10,886
Master has started preaching to us

2281
02:29:10,910 --> 02:29:11,990
Ignore them bro

2282
02:29:12,040 --> 02:29:14,176
Why do you treat them
on an equal footing with you?

2283
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:15,960
These mongrels won't reform
even if they die!

2284
02:29:15,990 --> 02:29:17,950
Hey! How can they reform?

2285
02:29:18,660 --> 02:29:20,950
When have we treated him with respect?

2286
02:29:20,990 --> 02:29:23,790
Or given him time place
or an opportunity to reform?

2287
02:29:24,240 --> 02:29:27,080
Golisoda Ulligadu Blade Babji Chain Shiva
Soda Sekar what kind of names?

2288
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:29,740
Then how will they remember
their family or tender love and care?

2289
02:29:31,160 --> 02:29:33,120
Family and society alienate them

2290
02:29:33,160 --> 02:29:35,370
If everybody has exiled him
how will he reform?

2291
02:29:38,120 --> 02:29:39,370
Come here ra

2292
02:29:39,620 --> 02:29:40,700
What?

2293
02:29:41,620 --> 02:29:44,700
1st crime by many boys here
is based on emotion quotient

2294
02:29:45,450 --> 02:29:47,466
Affection betrayal anger
or a rush of adrenalin

2295
02:29:47,490 --> 02:29:48,780
Each with a reason

2296
02:29:49,790 --> 02:29:51,160
But after the first time

2297
02:29:51,240 --> 02:29:55,490
You know what instigates you to commit
every crime you pile on to your account?

2298
02:29:55,950 --> 02:29:57,240
Intoxication!

2299
02:30:00,080 --> 02:30:01,700
I can bet on this ra

2300
02:30:02,370 --> 02:30:05,516
All other crimes after your 1st was
committed losing control of your senses

2301
02:30:05,540 --> 02:30:07,676
Didn't you booze?
Didn't you have a ball?

2302
02:30:07,700 --> 02:30:08,790
Oh! Yes sir

2303
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:10,200
Open your warped mind!

2304
02:30:10,540 --> 02:30:12,580
Only a drunkard can talk
of how it ruined his family

2305
02:30:13,370 --> 02:30:14,950
Only because of my addiction

2306
02:30:15,950 --> 02:30:18,290
2 boys lost their lives
I got that into my thick head

2307
02:30:18,910 --> 02:30:19,950
I quit drinking

2308
02:30:19,990 --> 02:30:22,740
'Chee! Don't be a drama king master!'

2309
02:30:22,780 --> 02:30:24,176
Am I brewing liquor at home?

2310
02:30:24,200 --> 02:30:25,886
Blaming the buyer
instead of the seller!

2311
02:30:25,910 --> 02:30:29,540
That's exactly what I'm saying
This intoxication is a political game

2312
02:30:30,490 --> 02:30:32,870
You are not yet 18 years
You can't watch this Adult film

2313
02:30:32,910 --> 02:30:34,990
A security guard stands out
to push you out right?

2314
02:30:35,330 --> 02:30:37,580
Why is no one standing guard
outside a wine shop?

2315
02:30:37,660 --> 02:30:41,200
How do 10 -15 year olds get hold
of a booze bottle and cigarette?

2316
02:30:42,620 --> 02:30:43,990
Politics

2317
02:30:45,740 --> 02:30:48,120
Bhavani is moving his pawn
and playing this kind of politics

2318
02:30:48,910 --> 02:30:51,160
When the law is against child labor

2319
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:54,780
...that beast is forcing the same boys
into nefarious activities unwillingly

2320
02:30:58,450 --> 02:30:59,540
What is this?

2321
02:31:00,200 --> 02:31:01,410
What is it?

2322
02:31:01,660 --> 02:31:04,240
Like bribing you to vote and
you end up with an inked finger

2323
02:31:04,290 --> 02:31:07,120
He gives you freebies and
brands you with a tattoo

2324
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:12,040
He has bathed you in basic amenities
providing free food and clothing

2325
02:31:14,990 --> 02:31:16,620
Why would you reform?

2326
02:31:17,950 --> 02:31:19,330
Enough of this atrocity

2327
02:31:19,910 --> 02:31:23,950
You have packed those boys who believed
they have a good future into that truck

2328
02:31:25,450 --> 02:31:28,290
Don't know if they will hang from a fan
or be run over by a tyre

2329
02:31:29,370 --> 02:31:30,410
But

2330
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:32,780
I will save them

2331
02:31:33,290 --> 02:31:35,200
Every single one of them

2332
02:31:41,580 --> 02:31:43,290
What did he say ra?

2333
02:31:43,410 --> 02:31:45,620
He will kill all those who like me?

2334
02:31:46,080 --> 02:31:47,240
Hey!

2335
02:31:47,290 --> 02:31:49,040
[amused laughter]

2336
02:31:50,040 --> 02:31:52,790
There are zillions outside who like me
Mind body heart and soul da

2337
02:31:55,780 --> 02:31:57,580
If he's a man let him try his luck

2338
02:32:01,160 --> 02:32:02,240
Bro...?

2339
02:32:02,840 --> 02:32:06,416
Bhavani's proxies files, documents, money,
filling it in a container,

2340
02:32:06,440 --> 02:32:08,616
They were discussing of crossing
border overnight, brother

2341
02:32:08,640 --> 02:32:10,140
Children too are in it

2342
02:32:23,410 --> 02:32:24,766
Bhavani - hmm

2343
02:32:24,790 --> 02:32:26,176
All 40 lorries have crossed the border

2344
02:32:26,200 --> 02:32:28,200
Expected anytime now

2345
02:32:28,620 --> 02:32:30,290
How many hour?

2346
02:32:30,370 --> 02:32:32,450
One hour, Das is bringing them
in the container

2347
02:33:54,950 --> 02:33:57,580
Hey, go!

2348
02:33:59,660 --> 02:34:01,370
Go

2349
02:34:41,740 --> 02:34:44,290
Hold my Hand

2350
02:34:45,290 --> 02:34:47,410
Finish her off!

2351
02:34:47,700 --> 02:34:50,290
Hold my hand

2352
02:34:56,290 --> 02:34:58,620
Come inside

2353
02:36:48,790 --> 02:36:51,990
Collide into his car and kill him

2354
02:37:09,080 --> 02:37:11,490
Come... come

2355
02:37:11,540 --> 02:37:14,620
'Enough... Enough'

2356
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:17,370
If those 15 boys turn approvers
whom will they point a finger at?

2357
02:37:17,410 --> 02:37:18,450
Das of course

2358
02:37:18,490 --> 02:37:20,410
They have not knew you Bhavani

2359
02:37:20,490 --> 02:37:22,080
What if Das turns approver?

2360
02:37:28,330 --> 02:37:29,830
They will tell your name

2361
02:37:30,240 --> 02:37:31,950
Then kill Das

2362
02:37:43,160 --> 02:37:44,240
Go

2363
02:37:56,290 --> 02:37:59,080
Go....Go ra

2364
02:37:59,700 --> 02:38:02,240
Do you want him to kill me
out of your sight?

2365
02:38:02,330 --> 02:38:04,080
You always say

2366
02:38:04,290 --> 02:38:06,790
'I will give my life for you'

2367
02:38:07,160 --> 02:38:08,410
Give it.

2368
02:38:11,490 --> 02:38:14,040
I thought of you
as my own elder brother - What?

2369
02:38:14,120 --> 02:38:16,200
I regarded you as my (brother)

2370
02:38:16,240 --> 02:38:18,740
Even I thought of you
as my very own younger brother

2371
02:38:18,910 --> 02:38:20,030
'What do you want me to do?'

2372
02:38:20,120 --> 02:38:21,490
Where are the boys?

2373
02:38:22,490 --> 02:38:24,040
Where are they ra?

2374
02:38:25,120 --> 02:38:27,950
Hey! Go and check the container

2375
02:38:29,540 --> 02:38:32,240
Go... move it

2376
02:38:33,740 --> 02:38:35,240
Bloody-

2377
02:38:47,990 --> 02:38:50,490
Let's see who wins You or me?

2378
02:38:50,540 --> 02:38:52,200
Das listen to me

2379
02:38:52,290 --> 02:38:54,490
Listen to me JUST LISTEN!

2380
02:38:55,490 --> 02:38:56,490
Hear me out

2381
02:38:56,740 --> 02:39:00,870
Oral statement by all those boys
point fingers accusingly only at you

2382
02:39:01,160 --> 02:39:03,700
They don't even know the name Bhavani

2383
02:39:04,080 --> 02:39:05,540
Bhavani knows that too

2384
02:39:05,620 --> 02:39:06,740
Give it serious thought

2385
02:39:06,870 --> 02:39:08,490
Will he kill all the boys?

2386
02:39:08,620 --> 02:39:11,540
Or kill the one they are pointing
fingers at which is YOU?

2387
02:39:11,740 --> 02:39:14,660
You deserve to die
In one swift blow I'll-

2388
02:39:16,200 --> 02:39:18,290
I not came for that...

2389
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:21,370
Let's stop with the lives already lost

2390
02:39:21,830 --> 02:39:23,716
I'm saying this like a broken record

2391
02:39:23,740 --> 02:39:24,950
Bhavani is clever

2392
02:39:24,990 --> 02:39:27,660
He won't kill the boys
His target is YOU

2393
02:39:28,290 --> 02:39:30,580
Listen to me once Only this time

2394
02:39:30,660 --> 02:39:34,160
Ask him if you can bring the boys
in front of him he will say 'no'

2395
02:39:34,330 --> 02:39:35,700
Continue to ask repeatedly

2396
02:39:35,870 --> 02:39:37,580
You'll know the true colors of Bhavani

2397
02:39:37,660 --> 02:39:40,830
If this doesn't happen-

2398
02:39:42,040 --> 02:39:43,870
My life is yours

2399
02:41:55,740 --> 02:41:56,950
Welcome master!

2400
02:41:58,990 --> 02:42:01,740
This is the first time
we are meeting right?

2401
02:42:05,620 --> 02:42:08,370
Loaded with emotion huh?

2402
02:42:08,490 --> 02:42:10,240
My dear master

2403
02:42:12,580 --> 02:42:15,580
Bhavani isn't just a name

2404
02:42:15,950 --> 02:42:18,160
It's a kingdom I created for myself

2405
02:42:18,410 --> 02:42:21,290
You can't create a world record
with your overnight lesson

2406
02:42:21,620 --> 02:42:25,700
If he was sharing his pearls of wisdom
what about the mud between your ears?

2407
02:42:27,620 --> 02:42:29,910
You carried that boy on your waist?

2408
02:42:30,080 --> 02:42:32,240
Did you think they are kids?

2409
02:42:33,160 --> 02:42:35,370
They are killers of the worst kind

2410
02:42:37,330 --> 02:42:39,490
I've already given you too much time

2411
02:42:39,660 --> 02:42:41,160
Still I'll give you 2 minutes

2412
02:42:41,490 --> 02:42:42,870
If you can ki-

2413
02:42:45,950 --> 02:42:48,240
Master why did you hit me in mid speech?

2414
02:42:48,290 --> 02:42:49,580
Didn't you ask for it?

2415
02:42:50,040 --> 02:42:51,240
Come

2416
02:42:51,740 --> 02:42:53,220
Is this all the force you can muster?

2417
02:44:08,410 --> 02:44:09,660
Master

2418
02:44:49,580 --> 02:44:51,950
[fired up laughter]

2419
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:04,540
Hi....

2420
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:10,660
Bring him

2421
02:45:16,330 --> 02:45:21,160
[overlap of anxious voices]

2422
02:45:21,370 --> 02:45:25,330
Master...

2423
02:45:27,830 --> 02:45:29,620
Job done and dusted

2424
02:45:31,580 --> 02:45:33,740
'Lord pardon this sinner'

2425
02:45:38,790 --> 02:45:40,176
Master - Don't!

2426
02:45:40,200 --> 02:45:41,330
Do not kill him

2427
02:45:43,120 --> 02:45:46,540
Hey! I am fighting here for your sake

2428
02:45:47,450 --> 02:45:50,580
So your hands don't grip
a knife once more

2429
02:45:50,660 --> 02:45:51,660
Wrong

2430
02:45:52,040 --> 02:45:55,910
I'm fighting your cause for your mind
not to go back to its old ways

2431
02:45:55,950 --> 02:45:57,370
Not one of you

2432
02:45:57,660 --> 02:45:59,700
Not even one of you
should raise his hand

2433
02:46:01,450 --> 02:46:03,580
Step back

2434
02:46:04,490 --> 02:46:06,120
MOVE BACK!

2435
02:46:09,450 --> 02:46:14,330
"O master, no one is there
to touch me in Warangal"

2436
02:46:14,910 --> 02:46:17,740
"wherever I am, I rule the roost"

2437
02:46:17,830 --> 02:46:20,240
"That's my word"

2438
02:46:20,290 --> 02:46:22,160
Remix! 'How was it?'

2439
02:46:22,290 --> 02:46:26,580
Started taking lessons
before entering class, last lesson?

2440
02:46:27,290 --> 02:46:28,290
Get up

2441
02:46:51,540 --> 02:46:54,410
'Master... master'

2442
02:46:58,160 --> 02:47:00,200
'Master... master'

2443
02:47:16,790 --> 02:47:18,450
'Master... master'

2444
02:47:43,490 --> 02:47:48,040
- Hey... hey - Master

2445
02:48:10,790 --> 02:48:14,120
- Take the boys to the truck

2446
02:48:15,200 --> 02:48:16,240
Hey Dasu

2447
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:57,660
"Twinkle twinkle little star,
Bhavani got the kick"

2448
02:48:57,700 --> 02:48:59,700
"Thrashed him and punched him"

2449
02:48:59,740 --> 02:49:03,450
"Twinkle twinkle little star,
Bhavani got the kick"

2450
02:49:03,580 --> 02:49:06,700
"Thrashed him and punched him"

2451
02:49:26,740 --> 02:49:31,200
Master... wait

2452
02:49:31,990 --> 02:49:33,620
Sit down

2453
02:49:37,450 --> 02:49:38,660
Master

2454
02:49:40,580 --> 02:49:43,016
A problem won't be solved
by killing a person

2455
02:49:43,040 --> 02:49:45,330
I asked a man when I was just 17

2456
02:49:45,830 --> 02:49:47,790
This is the same request
I'm asking you

2457
02:49:48,490 --> 02:49:50,290
Let me live

2458
02:49:50,660 --> 02:49:52,080
I will do anything for you

2459
02:49:52,830 --> 02:49:54,790
I won't harm those boys

2460
02:49:55,120 --> 02:49:58,080
You are the one who made
those innocent children criminals

2461
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:00,200
One-

2462
02:50:01,410 --> 02:50:03,240
Only 1 year

2463
02:50:03,330 --> 02:50:07,740
You were let into that Observation Home
and you've progressed so much in life

2464
02:50:07,950 --> 02:50:11,450
If you are punished and sent to jail
imagine what you'll do to this town

2465
02:50:17,120 --> 02:50:18,870
I'll get into politics

2466
02:50:20,240 --> 02:50:21,620
I'll start a party

2467
02:50:22,450 --> 02:50:24,160
Will you join me?

2468
02:50:24,830 --> 02:50:25,990
Master

2469
02:50:27,410 --> 02:50:28,450
What?

2470
02:50:28,660 --> 02:50:30,370
Sssshhhhhh!

2471
02:50:53,870 --> 02:50:55,790
[triumphant laughter]

2472
02:50:56,790 --> 02:50:59,200
Done and dusted

2473
02:51:03,790 --> 02:51:08,290
"Let me sing a 'chitti' story
Pay attention listen to me"

2474
02:51:10,040 --> 02:51:14,490
"If you want take it or else
no need tension leave it baby"

2475
02:51:16,200 --> 02:51:19,290
"Life is very short dude"

2476
02:51:19,450 --> 02:51:21,040
- Master - Who is that?

2477
02:51:22,910 --> 02:51:24,490
The boys are in the truck master

2478
02:51:26,450 --> 02:51:28,620
Come here Sit down

2479
02:51:29,240 --> 02:51:30,580
Sit

2480
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:38,450
Shall I surrender instead of you?

2481
02:51:40,330 --> 02:51:42,660
Won't you understand till the very end?

2482
02:51:42,870 --> 02:51:45,950
Each person has to endure
the punishment according to his crime

2483
02:51:47,080 --> 02:51:48,290
Madcap!

2484
02:51:48,410 --> 02:51:50,490
I feel I should do something for you

2485
02:51:50,540 --> 02:51:53,240
Tell me if you have a family
I'll take care of them till you're back

2486
02:51:54,740 --> 02:51:58,580
I overheard the children in the reformatory
saying you loved a girl it seems

2487
02:51:59,120 --> 02:52:01,740
A girl from an affluent family
Already engaged to someone

2488
02:52:02,490 --> 02:52:03,990
Shall I go and talk to her?

2489
02:52:05,620 --> 02:52:07,540
This looks good proposal!

2490
02:52:08,080 --> 02:52:10,040
Listen my dear brother

2491
02:52:10,740 --> 02:52:12,370
My name was not JD then

2492
02:52:12,990 --> 02:52:14,330
Jack Daniels

2493
02:52:14,620 --> 02:52:17,040
People called me 'Jack'

2494
02:52:17,410 --> 02:52:19,080
I used to draw well

2495
02:52:19,120 --> 02:52:20,490
Good at a game of cards

2496
02:52:21,080 --> 02:52:25,240
In such a game we were lucky
My friend and I won 2 tickets

2497
02:52:26,240 --> 02:52:29,410
You would have seen everyone
run to catch a bus or train

2498
02:52:29,740 --> 02:52:33,160
But imagine we ran and caught a ship
about to leave the dock

2499
02:52:33,660 --> 02:52:35,120
Huh?

2500
02:52:35,490 --> 02:52:38,040
That's where I set eyes on her
for the very 1st time

2501
02:52:38,580 --> 02:52:40,450
Her name was Rose

2502
02:52:42,540 --> 02:52:43,790
What did you say her name was?

2503
02:52:44,740 --> 02:52:45,740
Rose

2504
02:52:45,950 --> 02:52:47,660
Rose... Jack

2505
02:52:47,950 --> 02:52:49,290
Listen to my love story

2506
02:52:49,790 --> 02:52:52,056
After I fell head over heels
in love with her I found out

2507
02:52:52,080 --> 02:52:53,660
...she's already engaged

2508
02:52:54,950 --> 02:52:57,830
After that as we were sailing smoothly

2509
02:52:57,910 --> 02:53:00,370
The ship hit an iceberg on the way?

2510
02:53:01,620 --> 02:53:02,830
How do you know that?

2511
02:53:02,870 --> 02:53:04,370
I'll wait outside master

2512
02:53:04,410 --> 02:53:06,466
- Listen to my full epic love story
- No need it's okay master

2513
02:53:06,490 --> 02:53:07,490
I'll wait outside

2514
02:53:08,410 --> 02:53:13,636
'Since manipulation of boys into crimes
by anti social elements was proved'

2515
02:53:13,660 --> 02:53:15,950
'The Observation Home was shut down'

2516
02:53:15,990 --> 02:53:20,330
'Of the 63 inmates those above 18
were sent to Central Prison'

2517
02:53:20,410 --> 02:53:23,120
'And those below 18 were sent
to other Govt reformatories'

2518
02:53:23,160 --> 02:53:25,466
Press your thumb on this stamp pad
and give your fingerprint

2519
02:53:25,490 --> 02:53:27,490
Not there

2520
02:53:29,330 --> 02:53:30,700
Go inside

2521
02:53:37,660 --> 02:53:39,830
What is the crime you are serving term for?

2522
02:53:40,620 --> 02:53:43,580
Baby face partner
Must be a gigolo

2523
02:53:43,620 --> 02:53:45,870
Look at his face
Like a parcel folded into four

2524
02:53:45,910 --> 02:53:48,990
Juveniles of Warangal
in that Bhavani case

2525
02:53:49,080 --> 02:53:51,540
I heard it was 7 of them
Only 6 are here

2526
02:53:51,580 --> 02:53:54,200
Baby face is here
handsome face is missing

2527
02:53:54,240 --> 02:53:55,450
Where is the master?

2528
02:53:55,490 --> 02:53:58,160
Must have been sent
to Chanchalguda jail

2529
02:54:03,490 --> 02:54:04,950
It's even more convenient partner

2530
02:54:04,990 --> 02:54:07,990
We go to Chanchalguda in 10 days
We'll finish him there

2531
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:10,990
Then we will meet your master
in Chanchalguda

2532
02:54:12,990 --> 02:54:14,830
Transfer only after 10 days huh?

2533
02:54:14,870 --> 02:54:16,580
- Are you here till then?
- Why?

2534
02:54:16,620 --> 02:54:18,200
Drag that 'beedi'

2535
02:54:18,240 --> 02:54:20,040
This is the last 'beedi' you'll smoke

2536
02:54:20,870 --> 02:54:22,330
Commands that kind of fear huh?

2537
02:54:22,370 --> 02:54:24,330
You're teaching ME
about the 'prisoner'!!

2538
02:54:24,870 --> 02:54:26,620
You would have seen
big shot prisoners

2539
02:54:26,660 --> 02:54:28,120
But guess who is coming now

2540
02:54:28,160 --> 02:54:29,450
MASTER

2541
02:55:02,990 --> 02:55:05,620
