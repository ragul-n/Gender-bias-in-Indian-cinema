19
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:18,292
I should get going...
Have to pick him up from the factory...

20
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,973
Must be waiting for me.

21
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:23,418
Anita, bring those papers
and Dinesh's letters

22
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:25,450
Is there anything of
my concern in them?

23
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:27,364
Not just something but a lot...

24
00:03:27,434 --> 00:03:29,170
In that letter,
he has convinced

25
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:32,026
your father-in-law,
I mean Seth ji (business owner)

26
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:33,947
for collaborating with
the foreign company.

27
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:36,534
After all it is
Uncle-nephew relationship

28
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,579
Seth ji has anyway
lost it these days.

29
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:42,363
He is still living in the 40s.

30
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,573
But, Russi should have
prepared the report by now.

31
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:49,119
He is designing the machine himself.

32
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,064
I also want it like that.

33
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:53,152
He is an intelligent boy...

34
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,893
but he doesn't understand
the value of time.

35
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,475
By the way, the machines from
the foreign company are also good, right?

36
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:01,298
Only their design.

37
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,398
and then, why don't you get this...

38
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:06,548
Dinesh is concerned about himself,
not the factory

39
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:08,958
He is good with talks.

40
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:11,847
He will get money piled up
in Swiss Banks

41
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,334
and then he is out,
the factory can go to hell.

42
00:04:14,449 --> 00:04:17,496
Otherwise why buy all
this second hand junk

43
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,105
Seems you are going to get into
a tussle in this meeting.

44
00:04:21,146 --> 00:04:25,409
No, will sacrifice the pawns
for saving a checkmate.

45
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:28,152
You won't get over your antics.

46
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:36,341
This time we should definitely
get a bonus.

47
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:39,116
Ma'am, Rahul sir is
in a meeting.

48
00:04:39,141 --> 00:04:40,829
Will you go in?
- No way

49
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:44,503
Mangatram, don't you know
that madam doesn't go in...

50
00:04:44,707 --> 00:04:46,904
she stays right here with us...

51
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:49,826
Madam, you didn't get Munna
along with you?

52
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:52,511
Kamla's wedding is fiXed?
- Yes, yes.

53
00:04:53,504 --> 00:04:57,678
If only Dinesh ji could stall the
deal with the foreign firm a little.

54
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,218
That's not a problem,

55
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,083
anyway Dinesh stays
mostly abroad only.

56
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:06,015
The real question is whether...

57
00:05:06,053 --> 00:05:11,368
you will be able to give us the
precision of foreign machines?

58
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:16,114
Will we still need the technical
supervision of an MNC?

59
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,745
and the biggest question is
of marketing,

60
00:05:21,372 --> 00:05:23,692
of International label...
What say, Papa?

61
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:27,843
We can send the design
to Dinesh in London

62
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,298
so that he can get a better deal

63
00:05:31,149 --> 00:05:35,684
Vaise, we have already paid
the foreign company for estimates,

64
00:05:35,732 --> 00:05:38,921
we will have to go ahead
with this agreement in any case.

65
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,282
But if we can make these
machines ourselves...

66
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:43,699
Try and understand, Russi...

67
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:46,016
We are only concerned with profit.

68
00:05:48,178 --> 00:05:53,280
Sir, Dinesh ji's machines will neither
increase production nor quality.

69
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,478
For higher profit,
more important than higher production

70
00:05:57,528 --> 00:06:00,717
is to allocate the money
at the right places.

71
00:06:01,406 --> 00:06:05,232
If the foreign label helps us sell,
then that's okay.

72
00:06:05,492 --> 00:06:09,488
Otherwise, we could invest in
land, gold, etc...

73
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,014
Their prices will
keep appreciating.

74
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:15,115
Dinesh is working in
the right direction.

75
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:26,874
Sir, Patel.
- No.

76
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:29,520
It is very simple, Russi.

77
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,103
They are not going to give
us the latest machines...

78
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:38,047
but it will save us money now,
and that can be invested elsewhere...

79
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:40,530
We at least get
that much freed...

80
00:06:40,549 --> 00:06:43,525
And we won't get that
freedom without them.

81
00:06:44,173 --> 00:06:46,866
But Papa,
we shouldn't forget that...

82
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:50,748
Munna and then his child will
keep sharing their profit

83
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:54,524
... all their lives...

84
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,496
Vaise, why do you think Munna is
going to be living off this factory...

85
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,646
You can't even guess...

86
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,358
... the scale of his inheritance.

87
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:11,676
Vaise, you worry more
about my son than me

88
00:07:12,857 --> 00:07:14,771
and then your experience...

89
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:20,472
All that I am today
is due to you and Hansa...

90
00:07:23,272 --> 00:07:25,823
Did you tell sethji?
- Yes, of course.

91
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:28,208
Now, you leave...

92
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:35,497
The foreign company is going
to eat into your profits...

93
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:39,647
and that is why Dinesh
should limit the royalty to 2%.

94
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,144
and we should have the
right to inspect the machines.

95
00:07:45,177 --> 00:07:48,879
We should better leave these
decisions to Dinesh itself.

96
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,779
But Papa, whatever the agreement is,
legally we have the last word.

97
00:07:53,815 --> 00:07:55,633
Yes, that's absolutely correct.

98
00:07:55,778 --> 00:08:00,953
If it satisfies you, trust me
to keep this in consideration.

99
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:06,501
So, shall I take your leave?
Hansa is waiting outside...

100
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,680
Daughter is waiting out?
Didn't come in...

101
00:08:13,111 --> 00:08:15,663
Why should she care
about her father?

102
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,800
Anyway, daughters
are never your own...

103
00:08:18,841 --> 00:08:21,714
No Sir, society is
now run by them.

104
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:35,025
You did come.

105
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:36,545
Yeah, I had told you so.

106
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,776
<i>I thought you were just...
- Acting like a big leader, you asshole</i>

107
00:08:39,817 --> 00:08:42,942
<i>Why are you using abusive
language Janki Bai</i>

108
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:44,317
You went to the club?
- Yeah

109
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,195
What did you do?
- Nothing, got bored.

110
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:49,538
<i>Arre, I don't believe
that liar, Patel.</i>

111
00:08:49,554 --> 00:08:53,266
<i>Can't you be a little quieter,
Rahul Seth is just there</i>

112
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,101
Why should I be quiet
because of him?

113
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:59,193
hey, why do you think
they are quarreling?

114
00:09:02,803 --> 00:09:04,682
How much more should
I tolerate Seth ji?

115
00:09:04,707 --> 00:09:08,401
Patel didn't give the complete money
and says you gave less.

116
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:11,360
I know that I haven't
been given compensation,

117
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:13,465
but money to keep my mouth shut.

118
00:09:14,232 --> 00:09:18,400
He has himself kept half the money
and is even blaming my husband.

119
00:09:18,927 --> 00:09:22,247
I will certainly do something
about this Janki Bai, have faith.

120
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:26,031
Can't fill my stomach
with faith, Seth ji.

121
00:09:30,589 --> 00:09:32,297
Madam, you only tell me,

122
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,165
how much does a meal
cost at your place?

123
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:39,875
Rahul, please give her something.
- Of course darling.

124
00:09:45,954 --> 00:09:47,868
I am giving you all I have.

125
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:50,063
As if her husband's passing
away wasn't enough

126
00:09:50,128 --> 00:09:52,464
I wasn't even given
proper compensation.

127
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,432
Now they are even kicking
me out of my hut.

128
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:58,264
Madam, you only tell me,
what should I do?

129
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:02,506
Even if you don't give compensation,
at least give me some work.

130
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:07,622
You guys should be helping her.
If someone troubles you, let me know.

131
00:10:11,166 --> 00:10:13,086
Can't we employ her?

132
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:14,215
Right now...

133
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:19,588
If you want, you can keep
her as help at home.

134
00:10:29,393 --> 00:10:33,574
You take five hundred rupees now,
to keep your mouth shut.

135
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:38,606
but don't talk about
increasing wages this year.

136
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:41,117
But let's look at
Mahadev's wife.

137
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:42,529
Which Mahadev?

138
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,151
The same one, who used to
provoke the labourers

139
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,515
Asshole passed away...

140
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:55,659
Listen, take out the khaki
envelope from the top drawer

141
00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,531
yes, the dollar price
has increased? Five Lakhs..

142
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:05,789
I was clear about it
she won't get compensation or work

143
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:11,889
The poor widow...
let her be in the hut for a while.

144
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:16,117
Otherwise, others will
pity her unnecessarily.

145
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:19,853
Will take her side.
They can turn offensive too.

146
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:23,783
We have already let her
live for two months now.

147
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:28,266
and she keeps provoking
the young workers.

148
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:31,020
Now, do whatever you feel is right...

149
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,890
Give her these 100 rupees.

150
00:11:36,342 --> 00:11:38,688
That's it, your work is done.

151
00:11:38,778 --> 00:11:41,876
My work keeps going on Seth,

152
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,004
but am always available
in your service.

153
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:51,648
Our service?
You are serving the "times".

154
00:11:57,867 --> 00:12:00,489
Come on Munna,
shall we go home now?

155
00:12:03,831 --> 00:12:04,610
Am tired...

156
00:12:10,544 --> 00:12:14,938
Aye, you should make Abdul
understand before it's too late.

157
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:20,114
You guys keep talking of
stuff like this only.

158
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:22,902
Have you seen an
honest woman like her?

159
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:32,769
<i>What does Patel care if I get work?
He keeps licking Seth's ass...</i>

160
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:35,983
<i>and then tells us that
Seth is like our father</i>

161
00:12:36,024 --> 00:12:38,213
Like our father?
- Bastard...

162
00:12:38,253 --> 00:12:41,150
If he were not like our father,
why would he have given 1000 Rs...

163
00:12:41,174 --> 00:12:43,509
...for the sweeper's marriage?

164
00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:45,510
He fools us with charity.

165
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:46,898
To hide the truth.

166
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:50,071
When we work,
why do we need pity?

167
00:12:50,099 --> 00:12:52,367
and as if it's Seth's own money.

168
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:55,664
Do you know where the money
came from for this factory?

169
00:12:55,689 --> 00:12:59,373
During the 40's war
all he did was sell fake stuff.

170
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:01,688
and Patel has been
with him since then

171
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:03,478
He has never worked.

172
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:04,845
Then how come he is the leader?

173
00:13:04,878 --> 00:13:05,952
With his talks.

174
00:13:05,969 --> 00:13:08,377
He even tried to
bribe my husband,

175
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:12,360
But when he didn't agree,
he got him beaten up.

176
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:16,055
Mahadev was right.
We have to fight our own battles.

177
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:19,822
Since we have had our own union
we get double bonus

178
00:13:20,247 --> 00:13:23,931
and see what they give me
in place of my husband...

179
00:13:25,814 --> 00:13:28,466
What is happening here?
Why is she crying?

180
00:13:28,498 --> 00:13:30,728
What's your problem?
Mind your own business

181
00:13:34,742 --> 00:13:35,946
What do you want?

182
00:13:36,206 --> 00:13:37,624
C'mon, get going...

183
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:48,250
The God is very merciful.
Everything shall be alright

184
00:13:54,076 --> 00:13:57,511
Hansa, Hansa…
- Rahul.

185
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:26,253
Bye bye.

186
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:49,466
What are you doing here?

187
00:14:50,225 --> 00:14:51,510
What did you think,
the goons are back?

188
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,173
Do they have the balls to
come during the day?

189
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,042
Let them come this time,
I will make them see the stars.

190
00:14:57,833 --> 00:15:00,667
You are mad, what will you do alone.

191
00:15:00,917 --> 00:15:02,479
Will break their legs...

192
00:15:02,542 --> 00:15:04,104
let's see
how they kick you out of the hut.

193
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,000
- They will come again for rent.
- Why rent?

194
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,960
Will throw them a few rupees.

195
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:19,394
Is this a loot going on?

196
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:26,833
Mahadev used to think of us as brothers,

197
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,625
hen helping you is my responsibility

198
00:15:31,866 --> 00:15:36,193
But he also used to say that these
people can't be fought alone.

199
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,875
We don’t own these huts Abdul.

200
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:43,625
Why aren’t we? Is it a joke to vacate.

201
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,540
Let them call the police.

202
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:49,188
No, no, before the police
comes in I will leave.

203
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:54,917
Why Janaki? What happened?

204
00:15:57,175 --> 00:16:01,226
My father went mad.

205
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:07,458
Police and landlord burnt our huts.

206
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,958
They beat him up a lot,

207
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:15,021
he used to wander around... madman

208
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:21,792
my mother had also burnt in the hut

209
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,854
puss used to ooze out of the blisters

210
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:31,479
her screams were so silent

211
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,042
we came to the city

212
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:45,445
one day, father in his madness
either wandered away, or left us

213
00:16:47,345 --> 00:16:50,125
then mother also left

214
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,875
how long would she have kept
bearing the physical pain

215
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:58,229
I looked for work…
here, there, everywhere…

216
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:03,042
everyone said you are too young

217
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,333
and what all I had to do for these lives

218
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,750
police were always after

219
00:17:13,042 --> 00:17:15,833
from one footpath to another

220
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,292
everyone wanted the same thing

221
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:25,792
One contractor gave me work,
and I reached the factory.

222
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,646
There I met your brother.

223
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:35,063
Also a run away from home,
an orphan like me.

224
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:40,313
But he was not just worried
by his own pains, but by everyone's.

225
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:45,417
Many labourers
wouldn't get work for long.

226
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:50,583
For their rights, we all united
and marched on

227
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,354
The demands were met
and then I got work.

228
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:03,583
I felt like he didn't have two,
but three eyes.

229
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:08,708
You know the work he assigned me?

230
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,333
Make food for the homeless labourers

231
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,583
One day I was making roti (bread).

232
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,625
He came and asked

233
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,708
as to if I would marry him.

234
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:29,750
I blushed pink,
how could I have borne such happiness.

235
00:18:32,126 --> 00:18:35,772
Why did he ask me to marry him?

236
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:39,479
Because I fed him?

237
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:44,208
He would say no,
but I would still keep the roti,

238
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47,875
saying, one more...

239
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:51,813
Or maybe, because I used to
help him wash his hand,

240
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,792
standing very close to him.

241
00:18:56,417 --> 00:19:01,542
I would want to wipe
his sweat with my stole.

242
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:06,125
But he never saw me.

243
00:19:06,917 --> 00:19:10,563
Nor the flowers on my head.

244
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:19,750
One day I gave him a sweet,
he remarked that my hands had magic.

245
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,833
I gave him mine too.

246
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,625
Why did he ask me to marry?

247
00:19:32,167 --> 00:19:34,208
Was I beautiful then?

248
00:19:39,354 --> 00:19:41,199
You are still very beautiful.

249
00:19:44,695 --> 00:19:47,202
Listen, we should get you married.

250
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:53,858
Should I ask Khala (aunt) to look for a
petite fair young beauty for you?

251
00:19:54,813 --> 00:19:56,542
But where will I get someone like you

252
00:19:58,373 --> 00:20:02,734
I want a son like you…
Innocent, beautiful…

253
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:08,461
Now go away,
or your friends will pull your leg.

254
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,368
Listen, what is this that
you are leaving behind?

255
00:20:12,952 --> 00:20:16,050
I had gotten something to eat...
This is for you.

256
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:20,128
Take it for khala at least,

257
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,402
I have given her already.

258
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:42,520
I gave you a son, what else do you want?

259
00:20:43,131 --> 00:20:44,708
After all the body isn't everything...

260
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:50,875
Maybe that was also used to
give your father an heir.

261
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,125
Please don't say so Rahul.

262
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,896
Whatever is Munni's, is yours only…

263
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:00,875
Hansa....

264
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,896
Hansa, don't cry.
What is there to cry about?

265
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:09,750
Hansa.

266
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:13,208
Please tell me that you will
always take care of me,

267
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,125
you won't leave me na...
forever remain close to me...

268
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,042
Promise me Rahul.

269
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:26,167
Please look at me,

270
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,396
I still do look good, don't I?

271
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,747
Abdul gave this for you.

272
00:23:13,146 --> 00:23:14,542
I am really troubled,

273
00:23:18,293 --> 00:23:21,792
don't know what's gotten to him.

274
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:24,583
He keeps thinking of you only.

275
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:29,500
He says he will save you, whatever be.

276
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:35,479
But in the slum, there are butchers only,

277
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,917
what will he do alone?

278
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,146
People taunt him about you.

279
00:24:22,083 --> 00:24:25,208
Where will he get a bride like you,

280
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:29,104
but religion makes me hesitant.

281
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:34,771
Don't worry khala,
I have already told him so.

282
00:24:36,552 --> 00:24:40,198
He is like that only...
keeps thinking of others.

283
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:44,625
He has helped so many in the factory also.

284
00:24:45,125 --> 00:24:48,333
Just get him wed now,
it will all get sorted.

285
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:50,875
Where does he listen to me,
he says...

286
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:54,771
he hasn't met someone, such a beautiful
and spirited woman like Janaki

287
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,500
But don't you worry daughter,

288
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:02,896
Allah will make sure your home
will be set again.

289
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:33,000
Give me back my money,
leave me...

290
00:25:33,208 --> 00:25:35,000
Today we will settle all accounts.
- Don't touch me!

291
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,792
This is his only.
Even if I die, I wouldn't give in.

292
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,000
Come, you asshole,
we will put you in jail,

293
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:43,771
rent this out to someone else.
- Leave me!

294
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:47,083
We can sell her, will get at least 500 Rs.
- You bastards.

295
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:50,938
Now that you have filed a report,
we will have to take her to the station

296
00:25:51,296 --> 00:25:53,833
You bastard dogs,
your whole clan will go rot.

297
00:25:54,042 --> 00:25:55,042
my darling..

298
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:58,854
Come, come now to the police station.

299
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:38,208
Papa, when is Dinesh coming?
I wanted him to get some things.

300
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:39,877
He will get it, what's there.

301
00:27:41,178 --> 00:27:42,877
Today only got a letter from Wilson & heat.

302
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,250
What? And I wasn't even told.

303
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:54,406
So what? We decided in the last meeting that
he will do the deal there by himself only.

304
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:58,778
Yeah yeah,
he is sorting it out himself only.

305
00:28:01,817 --> 00:28:06,853
See Rahul, after me,
you two only have to steer this.

306
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,126
Now am pretty old and
with this heart condition

307
00:28:12,966 --> 00:28:15,879
But whatever has been done,
or is happening,

308
00:28:16,284 --> 00:28:17,958
I should at least be kept abreast.

309
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:21,330
We need to call a board meeting asap.

310
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:23,001
You are even worse than Papa,

311
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,917
can't trust anyone even a bit.

312
00:28:25,469 --> 00:28:27,208
Darling, if you better not meddle…

313
00:28:30,358 --> 00:28:32,107
What are their conditions papa.

314
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:33,867
That I don't remember no...

315
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,000
My darling little young one...
a little prince

316
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:50,025
We need two things-
machines and money, we will get both.

317
00:28:51,333 --> 00:28:54,724
What money, only on paper.

318
00:28:54,917 --> 00:28:57,833
They will be making the real money

319
00:28:58,042 --> 00:29:01,688
And they are not doing us a favour by
offloading their bad machines onto us.

320
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,979
Everyone is too excited when young,

321
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:12,938
You will understand when
you have taken responsibility.

322
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:16,896
To move ahead in life,
you need to have patience and contentment.

323
00:29:17,333 --> 00:29:18,708
Sethji, a call for you.

324
00:29:19,241 --> 00:29:22,886
- Who is it?
- Patel.

325
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:40,500
Whenever papa is there, you start fighting.

326
00:29:42,542 --> 00:29:45,333
He started all this selling nails.

327
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:49,854
And the successful run even today
is because of him only.

328
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:53,564
Hansa, for heaven's sake, when Papa
made money there were wars all over.

329
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:57,563
Even rocks and stones
were being sold as if Gold.

330
00:29:57,917 --> 00:29:59,583
Now things have changed.

331
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:03,083
I don't know why he is
become so clingy to me.

332
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,958
You are his mother after all,

333
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:08,375
His nanny looks over a hundred.

334
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:13,167
How will she handle him,
when she can't handle even herself?

335
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,771
Why don't you hire that
combative factory woman?

336
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:26,854
hey listen, take him down…
Go son... tata

337
00:30:32,585 --> 00:30:35,042
Your father is acting senselessly.

338
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:38,583
Whatever he is doing, is for us.

339
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:44,042
Otherwise what's lacking?
and, jewellery, money, everything is there.

340
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:45,667
And you only will get it.

341
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:49,250
Dinesh will get at most ten percent.

342
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:53,156
Why do you bother?
At least you can talk to him properly.

343
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:58,042
Yeah, why should I care,
and I can talk properly too.

344
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:02,604
But how should I share
responsibility with Dinesh?

345
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:06,510
He will gobble up everything.
And the world isn't run by jewellery.

346
00:31:06,771 --> 00:31:09,708
Now labourers are threatening a strike.

347
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,854
They have merged two different issues.

348
00:31:14,115 --> 00:31:17,760
Am sure Janaki's friends
have instigated this situation.

349
00:31:18,021 --> 00:31:21,667
They would by now know that Janaki
has been kicked out of the hut.

350
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:25,958
Now, they are asking for a raise.

351
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:29,865
Daily workers to be regularised,
residential arrangement.

352
00:31:31,417 --> 00:31:36,956
Sometimes I feel like I should
just leave all this and retire,

353
00:31:37,083 --> 00:31:42,775
but then I think of you, and my workers,
then I repress my emotions and stay.

354
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,681
Our benefit is that we give in
to at least some of their demands.

355
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:51,792
5 rs. over 100, how does that sound?

356
00:31:53,875 --> 00:31:57,521
What's wrong/right...
Let's pay right, and increase work.

357
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,878
Even if we have to let go of some workers.

358
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:06,000
They should get enough for the
basics at least, that I know.

359
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,708
However you think it's wise.

360
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:13,615
No man, your opinion matters too.

361
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,042
Anyway, I will take Munna for a drive.

362
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,833
What lovely weather.

363
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:30,250
He is so fond of cars Papa.

364
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,333
But that's a good thing...

365
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:36,240
You will of course like it,
you also like cars.

366
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:40,438
He is just like you papa.

367
00:32:55,194 --> 00:32:56,763
How much is this for?
Three Rupees?

368
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:00,260
What nonsense...

369
00:33:12,851 --> 00:33:16,083
What are you thinking?
Want to come?

370
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,292
Come...

371
00:34:14,583 --> 00:34:17,018
Hey, look at that - Smitha Patil

372
00:34:24,057 --> 00:34:26,941
Hey, let them know -
if they want pictures with us,

373
00:34:27,071 --> 00:34:30,092
they should hurry - we don't
have time for shooting and all...

374
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:34,896
The universe is expanding,

375
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:39,021
but this can't be the truth even if it
might actually be physical reality

376
00:34:40,292 --> 00:34:43,938
but scientifically, cognitively,

377
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,250
all that matters are thoughts,
ideas, nothing else.

378
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,000
You are trying to say that brain,
or the idea of reason...

379
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,458
See, you are again trying
to understand reality in fragments...

380
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:00,917
There is a difference
between truth and reality.

381
00:35:01,177 --> 00:35:04,167
The nature, the climates,
everything is subject to change...

382
00:35:04,427 --> 00:35:08,073
but truth,
truth is way beyond all of this.

383
00:35:08,333 --> 00:35:09,917
hmmmm... okay...
Munna now has to go home...

384
00:35:10,177 --> 00:35:12,250
Isn't he your son?

385
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,292
Isn't your name Amol Palekar?

386
00:35:14,552 --> 00:35:16,292
No, no, they call me Rahul.

387
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:17,792
Your autograph please...

388
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:19,375
Then how can this be?

389
00:35:19,635 --> 00:35:22,667
Then, then, how did you recognise me?

390
00:35:22,927 --> 00:35:26,573
Let's see, let's see what that
idiot has written... Please show...

391
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:27,958
No.

392
00:35:28,219 --> 00:35:29,625
Hey, he is leaving...

393
00:35:29,885 --> 00:35:31,708
Let's go meet him.

394
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:34,210
Arre, let him go...
He thinks he is a celebrity.

395
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:36,333
No man, he is a good person...

396
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:38,583
What nonsense,
Hero of the middle class...

397
00:35:38,844 --> 00:35:40,667
Do you even know the difference
between the Star and the Actor?

398
00:35:40,927 --> 00:35:42,542
Yeah yeah, you know it?
so do I...

399
00:35:42,802 --> 00:35:45,375
Did you see his first film?
- Yeah.

400
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:47,333
What lovely work he has done in that...

401
00:35:57,833 --> 00:35:59,833
My home is far away,

402
00:36:00,094 --> 00:36:02,667
I sleep in your embrace,

403
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:08,208
away from the mountains,
in the dark abyss of your embrace...

404
00:36:09,875 --> 00:36:11,931
What are you talking about?

405
00:36:12,192 --> 00:36:15,838
Take it, take all the money.

406
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:20,896
Come home...

407
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:29,771
Even the face of the moon has a scar...

408
00:36:32,375 --> 00:36:35,708
How much further
do we have to go, coachman?

409
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:54,296
Hey, stop, stop,
stop right here.

410
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,708
Weee, finance is not a problem,
it's the technical know-how.

411
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:03,709
Really?

412
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:06,958
Hehe,
why will finance be a problem for you?

413
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:11,604
In this country, trickery of
people like you only works...

414
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:17,229
You are dropping us home tonight,
aren't you? - Surely.

415
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,958
Is it an interest to make such art?

416
00:37:21,219 --> 00:37:26,376
But what art reaches the masses,
except political action?

417
00:37:26,636 --> 00:37:30,282
Thank you Hansa.
- Are you leaving?

418
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,920
Excuse me.
- Yes.

419
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,958
Let's leave now,
it's getting late.

420
00:37:37,219 --> 00:37:40,125
Just one more. - Once you start,
then there's just no stop.

421
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:44,031
...London again.
- I have gotten bored of London by now.

422
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:45,208
Is that so?

423
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:47,125
You should go somewhere
like Peking or Hanoi.

424
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,708
They won't even let you set foot there.

425
00:37:52,208 --> 00:37:55,854
Come, come..
- Good night Hansa.

426
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:05,313
It's become so difficult
just to catch up now a days. - Yeah.

427
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:10,250
Hey, where the fuck are you off to?
- To meet the Madame.

428
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:12,625
You can't meet her now.
- I have to meet her, now.

429
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:14,958
Hey, leave me.
Why are you hitting me, bastard?

430
00:38:15,219 --> 00:38:18,865
Who is that?
- A woman wants to meet you.

431
00:38:19,125 --> 00:38:22,771
Who is it?
- Madam, goons are after me.

432
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:24,958
This is that same factory woman.

433
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,125
The way you want to expand the factory -
we will work that out.

434
00:38:28,385 --> 00:38:29,708
Then, Saturday it is?
- Good night.

435
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,417
We will figure out all
the legal frameworks. - Yeah, yeah.

436
00:38:33,677 --> 00:38:37,323
Madam, I will do the dishes, clothes,
cleaning, everything. - Okay okay. Just wait.

437
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:40,625
The most important thing is money.
How can you generate from here?

438
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,771
Send her in for now,
will explain you everything later.

439
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:50,354
Guard, take her to Radha Bai's room.

440
00:38:50,615 --> 00:38:52,625
And get her the bedding and all.

441
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:54,417
So what were you saying?

442
00:38:54,677 --> 00:38:58,323
And then the machines? - Don't you worry
about the machines... right darling?

443
00:38:58,583 --> 00:39:00,917
Russi will take care of the same.

444
00:39:21,625 --> 00:39:23,833
Much obliged, bhaiya (elder brother).

445
00:40:18,431 --> 00:40:21,309
Namdev, we need to explain to them
that we don't want violence.

446
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:23,917
Yes, yes. Don't you worry about it.

447
00:40:28,547 --> 00:40:29,831
Please, no vandalism.

448
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:32,600
And please ask Dhyan Babu to keep calm.
He is really hot headed.

449
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:35,008
Please don't lose your convictions.

450
00:40:40,451 --> 00:40:42,345
Stick by your demands.

451
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:48,854
Have faith, all our demands would be met.

452
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:20,729
We will get what's our right.

453
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,635
Janaki Bai, at least you got work.
- Where were you so many days, Janaki?

454
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:26,792
Fulfil our demands!

455
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:28,875
Now, Patel won't last for too long.

456
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:30,708
Arre, she is looking totally like a madam.

457
00:41:30,969 --> 00:41:32,500
You are so drunk
so early in the morning?

458
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,625
This work
also is because of the strike only.

459
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,375
Janaki Bai, Long live.

460
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:40,542
Hey, do you know the workers are
thinking of calling off the strike?

461
00:41:40,802 --> 00:41:43,458
Janaki Bai, can you get us work?
- Why not, she will just tell the madam.

462
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:48,229
Listen, listen,
keeping your troubles in consideration,

463
00:41:49,292 --> 00:41:52,938
management
has increased wages by ten rupees.

464
00:41:53,198 --> 00:41:56,844
This would lead to losses for the company.

465
00:41:57,104 --> 00:42:02,958
Keeping that in mind, I'd say the increase
you've got is not because of the strike,

466
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:05,833
but due to the generosity of the owner.

467
00:42:06,094 --> 00:42:07,833
The owner's dog.

468
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:12,813
At least just hear me out.
Please stop chanting.

469
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:17,167
Just listen to me.

470
00:42:18,542 --> 00:42:24,001
See Papa, we anyway give the workers
120 days of work in a year.

471
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:27,125
Then why not just guarantee it.

472
00:42:27,385 --> 00:42:31,750
If you guarantee that,
then again later they will create nuisance.

473
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,656
Not only me, even Dinesh agrees
with giving this guarantee.

474
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:40,293
And if you look at foreign companies,
they don't provide guarantee, but provide PF and all.

475
00:42:40,553 --> 00:42:44,199
And giving 120 days' work doesn't mean
that we give them...

476
00:42:44,459 --> 00:42:45,917
...benefits of regular/tenured employment.

477
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:48,583
Okay baba, call that jackal in.

478
00:42:50,583 --> 00:42:54,229
You shouldn't have come in now.

479
00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:58,969
After all, the temporary workers are our comrades.
There should be some decision on their fate.

480
00:42:59,167 --> 00:43:01,333
But how long can we stay on like this.

481
00:43:01,594 --> 00:43:04,208
We can think of others,
once we have enough to eat.

482
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:08,115
See, we should accept these terms
for some days.

483
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:11,521
But explain to them that without
the red flag, nothing will work out.

484
00:43:11,677 --> 00:43:15,323
And when these whites come up,
we should drown them with our chants.

485
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,709
Janaki, at least you too are with us?

486
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:24,250
Hey, listen, listen.
Listen to me brothers.

487
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:28,083
I want to give a good news.

488
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:31,990
Instead of 10 rupees hike,
you will get 15 rupees hike.

489
00:43:33,458 --> 00:43:35,083
Listen, listen, listen,

490
00:43:35,344 --> 00:43:41,627
Our temporary worker brothers will get a
guarantee of 150 days of work in a year.

491
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:48,021
All hails to labour unity.
- Long live labour brotherhood.

492
00:44:07,458 --> 00:44:10,750
Papa, we shouldn't go to the dinner.

493
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,292
After consultation with the doctor,
we should come back home.

494
00:44:13,552 --> 00:44:16,083
Why? Because Munna will be left alone?

495
00:44:16,344 --> 00:44:18,542
No, no,
Janaki Bai takes good care of Munna.

496
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:21,011
You are the one who is not that well.

497
00:44:21,833 --> 00:44:26,553
Janaki, tell Rahul Sir
that we might get late.

498
00:44:26,814 --> 00:44:29,042
We have to go to a party.

499
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:32,948
We might head there straight
from the doctor's. - Okay madam.

500
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:36,854
Shall we? - You know Gavardhan Das
is an important financier.

501
00:44:40,542 --> 00:44:44,875
Tapde, this person wasn't like this.

502
00:44:45,135 --> 00:44:48,781
He did everything possible
for the independence struggle.

503
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:53,979
His father's money,
the dreams of youth,

504
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,917
education, he left everything
and jumped into the fire.

505
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,583
Let those things just be.

506
00:45:06,667 --> 00:45:11,376
It was Gandhiji's decree,
who could have broken it?

507
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:15,282
And now?
Now you have become a seth?

508
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:18,125
Nothing like your seth,

509
00:45:18,385 --> 00:45:22,875
who will pay people like you 5-10 Rs.
to stop other's income.

510
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,333
Hey, never mind that, okay?

511
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:29,835
Why get offended by the truth?

512
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:35,625
You are doing your father's business,
I am doing sin's business.

513
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:46,208
To be able to live with the times,
there has to be some base.

514
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:52,774
There was one hope,
that also vanished.

515
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:57,979
Now someone gives you
alcohol with one hand,

516
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:00,750
and cheats you with the other.

517
00:46:01,010 --> 00:46:03,792
This is
what is happening with the violence,

518
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:06,708
the country is getting destroyed.

519
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:10,000
But there are no options
apart from the violence.

520
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,906
Gandhiji was fighting
against the British Empire.

521
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:17,667
That's why
he could do it with non-violence.

522
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:22,438
But when the fight is with
your own people, then what does one do?

523
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:25,277
But why is there a need
to fight one's own?

524
00:46:25,538 --> 00:46:28,250
Those who want to fight,
make them fight each other.

525
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:30,208
We are a secular state.

526
00:46:30,469 --> 00:46:32,583
This is the advantage
of the different faiths.

527
00:46:32,844 --> 00:46:35,625
But that is a reactionary approach.

528
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:40,167
Look at this... the bullet hit my leg.

529
00:46:40,427 --> 00:46:43,833
Had it gone to my chest,
I would have died right there.

530
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:49,292
In my area, I am the one who
started 'Quit India' movement.

531
00:46:49,552 --> 00:46:52,208
And you are calling me a reactionary?

532
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:56,115
Had you gotten beaten up in the freedom
struggle, then you would have known...

533
00:46:56,375 --> 00:47:00,250
who is a reactionary person,
and who is progressive.

534
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:06,708
How do I look in these clothes, Munna?

535
00:47:07,459 --> 00:47:08,708
I do look really nice, don't I...

536
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:16,521
Janaki Bai, someone has come to meet you.
- Who is it?

537
00:47:16,781 --> 00:47:18,208
I don't know him.

538
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:20,833
I will just be there.

539
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:28,292
Come on, Munna dear...

540
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,556
Guard,
please take care of him for a bit.

541
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:49,333
It's been so long since I met you.
How is Khala?

542
00:47:49,594 --> 00:47:52,000
She is fine,
just unhappy because of me.

543
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:54,167
Why do you trouble her?

544
00:47:54,427 --> 00:47:55,917
It's only her habit.

545
00:47:56,458 --> 00:48:01,208
She's a mother after all. - I can't
be worrying about her all the time.

546
00:48:03,125 --> 00:48:05,542
Last night,
there was another squabble in the slums.

547
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,854
It's really painful Janaki,
that because we're unable...

548
00:48:08,984 --> 00:48:12,318
to meet our needs,
we're made to confront each other.

549
00:48:14,042 --> 00:48:16,708
As if your and our needs are different.

550
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:22,000
How does one explain that to
repress the factory struggle...

551
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,000
...they are poisoning each of our homes.

552
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:29,938
Take Khala for instance, I don't know
what they have convinced her of...

553
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:32,250
...she has only started
discriminating amongst us.

554
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:35,875
This is what they are focussed on.

555
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,625
Okay, you please sit,
I will get tea.

556
00:49:04,292 --> 00:49:07,458
Namdev and I
are just worried about one thing...

557
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:10,833
...as to how to get rid of Patel.

558
00:49:13,333 --> 00:49:15,958
Our Kalyan is also just a weak one.

559
00:49:16,875 --> 00:49:19,625
They just want to
make the union into an office.

560
00:49:23,958 --> 00:49:26,625
There are a few boys
just outside the factory,

561
00:49:26,885 --> 00:49:30,000
with them, a lot can be done.

562
00:49:30,667 --> 00:49:35,083
Earlier I used to think that it's no
advantage being around these selfish people.

563
00:49:35,344 --> 00:49:38,990
But now, I am fine with it.
As for their rights...

564
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,896
...these boys
are ready to kill or even die.

565
00:49:43,458 --> 00:49:47,104
Please stop this nonsense.
It is giving me the chills.

566
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:52,938
Listen Abdul,if not for yourself,
you need to be safe for Khala.

567
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:01,521
God forbid, but in this whole affair,
you shouldn't be harmed.

568
00:50:01,781 --> 00:50:05,083
Don't you worry.
These boys are really good....

569
00:50:05,344 --> 00:50:07,250
... we will live together.

570
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:11,156
Why should I give Police
the chance to harass Khala?

571
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,670
Take this with you.

572
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,396
What do you think?
I am doing the right thing?

573
00:50:28,656 --> 00:50:32,302
I want to know how you feel...

574
00:50:34,294 --> 00:50:39,742
Abdul, what should I say? I too want you
to get married, and be doing this on the side.

575
00:50:40,002 --> 00:50:43,648
A lovely daughter in law for Khala,

576
00:50:43,908 --> 00:50:47,554
who would take care of you. Feed you...

577
00:50:47,815 --> 00:50:50,625
Right now you are like in a mess.

578
00:50:50,885 --> 00:50:53,625
I had asked you to...

579
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:57,338
What?

580
00:50:58,583 --> 00:51:02,229
That I want someone like you.

581
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:07,667
Okay, it's pretty late.
You should leave.

582
00:51:07,927 --> 00:51:10,125
I have to feed Munna too.

583
00:51:33,375 --> 00:51:35,083
Janaki...

584
00:51:37,917 --> 00:51:41,563
...how does this ring look?

585
00:51:41,823 --> 00:51:44,958
It glows on your fair skin.

586
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:53,209
Come, sit here.

587
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:11,688
Just try this on and show.
It will suit you.

588
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,355
C'mon, wear it.

589
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:30,292
Arre, you are radiating with it.

590
00:52:32,417 --> 00:52:36,063
If a man sees,
they will only get swayed. -What?

591
00:52:44,083 --> 00:52:47,729
Please open this box.
I am unable to.

592
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,146
So beautiful...

593
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:34,958
We women are also so tender,
men won't understand.

594
00:53:40,542 --> 00:53:46,875
I had read somewhere -
women are like rivers...

595
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,781
fluid... calm.... graceful...

596
00:53:52,625 --> 00:53:57,583
radiance of light touches them...
bounces off them...

597
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:08,438
A lot of men must be falling for you.

598
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:18,750
I know about my man...
He really liked me...

599
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,417
How sir likes you.

600
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:27,323
Yeah, he really loves me...
he is very kind...

601
00:54:28,708 --> 00:54:30,583
Lot like others...

602
00:54:31,667 --> 00:54:35,313
Isn't it also very difficult to
understand men?

603
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:54,813
Rahul really likes this perfume.

604
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,125
He really does love you a lot.

605
00:54:59,385 --> 00:55:03,031
I have seen him gazing at you too.
- What?

606
00:55:05,500 --> 00:55:08,458
Madam, you...
Munna should have a younger brother now.

607
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,646
No baba, I don't even know
how I made it with even one.

608
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,667
I don't have the energy now.

609
00:55:16,958 --> 00:55:18,833
You haven't had one?

610
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:22,750
You should set up another home.

611
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:26,875
Till when will you
be spending your nights alone?

612
00:55:27,135 --> 00:55:29,750
Find yourself a fit one.

613
00:55:30,917 --> 00:55:36,875
Who knows what'd happen to the worldliness
if this desire of being with a man goes away.

614
00:55:46,167 --> 00:55:49,813
Munna will grow up...
Where will he be once he grows up

615
00:56:19,917 --> 00:56:23,563
Think what will happen if
Munna grows up to be a tree.

616
00:56:23,823 --> 00:56:27,469
All the earth would be under
the shade of my Munna.

617
00:56:27,729 --> 00:56:31,375
Birds will also come there,
make their nests there.

618
00:56:34,625 --> 00:56:38,271
He will grow up...
where will he be?

619
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:03,438
A hill that is larger than the river,
and a cloud on top of the hill

620
00:57:03,698 --> 00:57:07,344
Even higher than the clouds
be the skirt of the sky.

621
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:17,021
The stars will appear on the skirt,
and the moon will come there then.

622
00:57:19,917 --> 00:57:22,125
Are we men?

623
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:25,542
We are cowards... cowards...

624
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:31,044
Had we not been, could they have dared to
make us fight between Hindu and Muslims?

625
00:57:34,417 --> 00:57:38,063
Did anybody speak up then?
for our unity?

626
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,646
Namdeo, you are not wrong...

627
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:47,813
But just reacting in rage
will not achieve anything.

628
00:57:48,073 --> 00:57:51,719
Firstly,
we need to get the people with us.

629
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:55,542
We need to have the majority with us.

630
00:57:55,802 --> 00:57:59,448
What did you say?
Majority? (smirks)

631
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:04,125
They are dividing and thus separating us.

632
00:58:06,708 --> 00:58:08,792
I think time is slipping away...

633
00:58:09,792 --> 00:58:14,260
...we should catch and thrash pyjama Patel,
we will regain control of the union.

634
00:58:14,521 --> 00:58:16,875
huh, beating?

635
00:58:17,135 --> 00:58:21,583
No, no, that's a bad idea.
- Abe, you are scared? WHY?

636
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:29,083
You think that they slap us on one cheek,
and then we offer the other?

637
00:58:30,292 --> 00:58:36,125
Peace? Do you know how many
will lose lives over this?

638
00:58:36,385 --> 00:58:38,833
Can you just listen and then react?

639
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:42,740
I don't think it's time
to take up arms already.

640
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,333
We will be cleaned out,
and there will be no one left to fight.

641
00:58:47,594 --> 00:58:49,708
And we need to fight right now.

642
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:57,292
One way to also fight
is to inform the cops.

643
00:58:57,552 --> 00:59:00,458
Yeah, yeah, police
will surely come to stop the riots.

644
00:59:01,167 --> 00:59:04,813
So should we get a satyagrah
(passive resistance) done by the police?

645
00:59:05,073 --> 00:59:09,417
If informing police is a waste,
then there are other ways too.

646
00:59:09,677 --> 00:59:14,344
Let's inform the people as to which
unions are our enemy.

647
00:59:14,604 --> 00:59:18,250
Are enemy of our unity.
Are traitors.

648
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:22,156
We will give testimonials,
will distribute money.

649
00:59:22,417 --> 00:59:26,000
This will be our program.
-Yes, this will definitely help our spirits.

650
00:59:26,323 --> 00:59:31,083
We will be doing something,
not remain silent. - This sounds okay.

651
00:59:31,344 --> 00:59:33,958
Let's prepare a statement.

652
00:59:34,219 --> 00:59:38,583
A statement is not enough. - At least
it will help with spreading the word

653
00:59:38,844 --> 00:59:42,490
This is a compromise,
NOT an attack.

654
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:45,042
Let's do a rally.
even if it is small.

655
00:59:45,302 --> 00:59:47,542
Yes, let's take out a rally
in front of the secretariat.

656
00:59:47,802 --> 00:59:50,458
What do you think?

657
00:59:52,542 --> 00:59:56,188
If everyone wants this only,
then it's okay.

658
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:12,271
Ma'am, I will get going...

659
01:00:12,531 --> 01:00:16,177
You want to sit for a while?

660
01:00:16,438 --> 01:00:20,083
No, I shall get going.

661
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:36,572
Namdeo, I have been fighting since ages,
and will continue till my last breath.

662
01:00:36,832 --> 01:00:40,478
But now the expectations are from you.

663
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:06,500
Only, let Munna sleep here.
He ain't feeling too well.

664
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,750
You can also sleep here.

665
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,948
- Here?
- Yeah.

666
01:03:56,708 --> 01:04:00,354
Rahul is calling you.
- what?

667
01:04:00,615 --> 01:04:02,667
Rahul has called you.

668
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:09,313
After dying, your hair really glows up.

669
01:04:09,573 --> 01:04:12,792
Like a blackberry...
black!

670
01:04:12,844 --> 01:04:15,875
Blackberry?
- Yeah, blackberry...

671
01:04:16,292 --> 01:04:19,083
Haven't you tasted it yet?

672
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:32,854
You just get your designs ready asap.

673
01:04:33,115 --> 01:04:36,417
Once we start making these
machineries here, then you see...

674
01:04:36,677 --> 01:04:40,323
Dinesh and his foreigner friends will...

675
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:44,229
They too seem to be keen on
pawning off the factory.

676
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,875
What?!?

677
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:02,375
Yes, am coming NOW.

678
01:05:03,208 --> 01:05:06,000
Papa is NOT feeling well.

679
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:14,583
I will change the whole way
this factory operates...

680
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:16,958
...with your able consultations.
-Yes Sir.

681
01:05:16,959 --> 01:05:18,917
No need for such formalities.

682
01:05:19,177 --> 01:05:24,417
You are like a director from today.
I shall take you on the board of directors.

683
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,750
Sir, but I don't want to.

684
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:31,875
Nonsense,
what is this shit about wanting to.

685
01:05:32,135 --> 01:05:35,500
You will do exactly as I say.

686
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:39,406
Of course,
whatever you say I shall also do.

687
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:54,083
Hansa, how is he?
- You go away.

688
01:05:54,344 --> 01:05:57,990
He is in only this state because of you.
- What??

689
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,896
What are you saying... due to me? - If you
leave these two alone, it'd be better.

690
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,583
He is getting better now.

691
01:06:56,208 --> 01:06:58,396
Sir,
- Shhh.

692
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:58,542
Sir, it was out of foolishness.
Won't happen again.

693
01:08:02,292 --> 01:08:05,938
It is okay Janaki.

694
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:14,542
Keep sitting there.

695
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:42,875
How did you do such a thing?

696
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:46,781
Stole away my shyness,
and didn't even see eye to eye?

697
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:31,833
Keep this,
you must be needing it.

698
01:12:33,833 --> 01:12:37,167
Rahul Sir, don't berate me that much also.

699
01:13:20,042 --> 01:13:23,688
Where does Abdul stay?
- Right over there.

700
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:22,271
Janaki?

701
01:14:22,531 --> 01:14:26,177
How did you find this place?
- Your friend told me.

702
01:14:26,438 --> 01:14:30,083
I had to really beg Namdeo.
He didn't even trust me.

703
01:14:30,344 --> 01:14:33,990
Yeah, it is pretty dangerous.

704
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:37,458
Here, I got you some money.

705
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:42,146
I won't take money from you.
- Stop being childish.

706
01:14:42,406 --> 01:14:46,052
I am keeping it right here.
- What will this much money do, Janakii?

707
01:14:46,313 --> 01:14:49,958
Your Seth and his family have
given so much money to Patel,

708
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:53,865
that he has goons from all over the city,
and we can't even get out.

709
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:59,354
Abdul, have patience.

710
01:14:59,615 --> 01:15:02,542
You can't do anything empty stomached.

711
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:10,146
Rahul Seth gives money to Patel also?

712
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:15,229
No,
I have heard that he doesn't like Patel.

713
01:15:16,667 --> 01:15:20,958
But Rahul Seth isn't with us, his
position is for his own benefit somehow.

714
01:15:25,042 --> 01:15:28,688
I haven't met Khala since so many months.
Have you met?

715
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:35,271
No, I will go.
- Should I come?

716
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:49,354
Munna must be coming back.
Nobody's home right now.

717
01:15:51,042 --> 01:15:53,260
If possible, do meet.

718
01:15:53,521 --> 01:15:57,167
You will come home?
-Yeah, yeah, I shall...

719
01:15:58,417 --> 01:16:00,583
Now you should leave.

720
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:06,563
Swear by Khala that you will come.
Okay?

721
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:45,021
My days are numbered now.

722
01:16:46,417 --> 01:16:50,063
Any time, I might conk off.

723
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:54,729
I have divided the inheritance
between you two and Dinesh.

724
01:16:56,292 --> 01:17:01,375
But that doesn't mean that you guys
break up your relationships after I die.

725
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:10,750
The rest, everything's God's will.
- Why say such things.

726
01:17:11,010 --> 01:17:14,656
We still need your guidance.

727
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:19,646
What ointment was this?
My head is blasting off.

728
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,167
I read Dinesh's letter in the evening.

729
01:17:26,469 --> 01:17:31,052
What right does he have to take such
a decision? - For God's sake Rahul,

730
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,958
if nothing else, please at least
think of Papa's health.

731
01:17:35,219 --> 01:17:37,917
I too
want Papa to write to him right now,

732
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:41,823
there is no need to get an engineer
from outside. We will manage ourselves.

733
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:50,042
Rahul, you don't have any trust
or faith in him, or even me or our family.

734
01:17:51,083 --> 01:17:57,958
You know that this factory
wouldn't have been without me.

735
01:17:58,219 --> 01:18:01,865
All workers
would have died of starvation.

736
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:12,792
This was God's will that we got to the
situation to be able to do some goodwill.

737
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:17,854
Otherwise all these assholes would
have been on the streets.

738
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:21,760
Yeah, and maybe even me.

739
01:18:22,021 --> 01:18:25,667
Rahul, what are you saying?
- Yes. And I am...

740
01:18:25,927 --> 01:18:30,813
...warning you for the last time that
if you don't sign this document,

741
01:18:30,918 --> 01:18:32,793
I will leave with Munna right away.

742
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,646
Then with your generous father, you can
keep doing all the philanthropy you want.

743
01:18:37,375 --> 01:18:42,250
Look at him, I have
considered him more than my own son.

744
01:18:42,510 --> 01:18:46,156
And he wants
to take away my Munna from me!

745
01:19:00,667 --> 01:19:05,000
You sign this.
- Please do it Papa.

746
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:08,906
After all, there must be some reason for
Rahul's stubbornness. It's not like he...

747
01:19:09,167 --> 01:19:12,813
...would want to harm us.

748
01:19:31,417 --> 01:19:35,063
Take me to my room.

749
01:19:35,323 --> 01:19:38,969
Actually, you just stay here.
Even Rahul isn't feeling well.

750
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:43,875
No Papa, I will take you.
- You come by later.

751
01:19:44,135 --> 01:19:47,781
After me also you have to
take care of Rahul and Munna.

752
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:04,792
You have crossed all limits of
shamelessness. - And what were you doing?

753
01:20:05,052 --> 01:20:07,542
That man has gone senile.
Go take care of him,

754
01:20:07,802 --> 01:20:09,375
otherwise he will go to the heavens.

755
01:20:09,635 --> 01:20:13,281
That's what you want.
- Yeah, so?

756
01:20:22,875 --> 01:20:27,708
Please forgive me Rahul. Promise that
you won't talk to Papa like that ever.

757
01:20:29,458 --> 01:20:33,104
I promise.

758
01:20:33,365 --> 01:20:37,010
Go, he needs you.

759
01:20:50,542 --> 01:20:52,750
What are you looking for?

760
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:55,458
aaa, umm, aaa,
Munna's elephant book.

761
01:20:55,719 --> 01:20:59,365
Munna is sleeping right now.
Look for it in the morning.

762
01:20:59,625 --> 01:21:03,271
And, make sure of Rahul Sir's
dinner and all. - Yes, Ma'am.

763
01:21:18,958 --> 01:21:22,604
Sir, should I get you
something to drink?

764
01:21:22,865 --> 01:21:26,510
Or, should I bathe you like I do ma'am.

765
01:21:31,417 --> 01:21:35,063
You want it like this, right?
- What?

766
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:39,813
That Seth dies away.

767
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:46,625
Now, what do you want to do?

768
01:21:50,542 --> 01:21:53,354
You should make your bed
in the guest room.

769
01:22:05,167 --> 01:22:08,813
Take out my clothes.

770
01:22:12,917 --> 01:22:16,563
Do keep an eye
on Munna during the night.

771
01:22:48,167 --> 01:22:50,375
Take this perfume.

772
01:22:51,031 --> 01:22:54,125
I have been thinking of giving
it to you since many days.

773
01:22:54,385 --> 01:22:58,031
What will I do with this ma'am.
- There's not much left anyway.

774
01:22:58,292 --> 01:23:01,938
It's a nice fragrance,
you should apply it.

775
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:12,979
The rest of the tenders?
- In the file.

776
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:17,792
I have heard that you are provoking
my workers on the basis of religion.

777
01:23:18,052 --> 01:23:21,698
Whatever I am doing
is for the factory's benefit.

778
01:23:22,292 --> 01:23:25,938
And this thing, you can
understand it better than Seth ji.

779
01:23:26,198 --> 01:23:29,844
I only understand that my workers
shouldn't be fighting me.

780
01:23:30,104 --> 01:23:33,750
And not even amongst themselves.
Do you get me?

781
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:39,542
I also don't like violence.
Seth ji pays just me to keep that away.

782
01:23:39,802 --> 01:23:43,448
And you anyway know,
that the workers work properly...

783
01:23:43,708 --> 01:23:47,354
by the fear of these goons only.

784
01:23:48,583 --> 01:23:52,229
And, to get these goons working,
some money has to be spent anyway.

785
01:23:53,875 --> 01:23:57,521
What kind of work?
- To maintain peace.

786
01:23:57,781 --> 01:24:01,427
You also don't want red flags
all over this factory. Or do you?

787
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:05,917
I do NOT care about red or yellow flags.

788
01:24:06,177 --> 01:24:09,823
If my workers demand more wage,
then I shall give them.

789
01:24:10,083 --> 01:24:13,729
I will expect them to work more.
- I must warn you that...

790
01:24:13,990 --> 01:24:17,635
...it is NOT such a simple matter.
- And I must warn you that...

791
01:24:17,896 --> 01:24:21,542
...if there are any riots in my factory,
then you will be the first one to be axed.

792
01:24:24,250 --> 01:24:27,896
But sir, these communists are becoming
more audacious by the day,

793
01:24:28,156 --> 01:24:31,802
just a little bit of money can solve that.
- Their audacity?

794
01:24:32,063 --> 01:24:35,708
How could you say that?
Communists are not illegals.

795
01:24:35,969 --> 01:24:39,615
Now they even have a state
government in West Bengal.

796
01:24:39,875 --> 01:24:43,521
And if nothing else, at least they won't
come in for a bribe everyday like you.

797
01:24:43,781 --> 01:24:47,427
It is NOT good for you to say so much.
- You can leave now.

798
01:24:47,688 --> 01:24:51,333
I will leave, but you
shouldn't have insulted me.

799
01:24:53,083 --> 01:24:56,729
I am NOT reacting right now
because of respect for Seth, otherwise...

800
01:24:56,990 --> 01:25:00,635
Anyway, I will sort out things
with Seth ji right away.

801
01:25:00,896 --> 01:25:07,703
No, you will not.
I have advised that he meet nobody.

802
01:25:09,167 --> 01:25:12,813
Didn't I ask you to leave?

803
01:25:15,542 --> 01:25:19,188
Okay!

804
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:23,094
Oh hello Tyagi, how are you?

805
01:25:25,167 --> 01:25:30,042
Listen, hadn't you mentioned that
international detective agency?

806
01:25:33,625 --> 01:25:37,271
Yes, I need to find out about
someone's Swiss bank account.

807
01:25:42,708 --> 01:25:46,354
No, it is just a suspicion,
there's no evidence yet.

808
01:25:53,167 --> 01:25:56,813
Money won't be a constraint.

809
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:15,063
Sir is calling you.
Something's wrong.

810
01:26:20,833 --> 01:26:23,833
Hansa, you....

811
01:26:24,792 --> 01:26:28,438
Please take ma'am to her room.

812
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:33,146
Please come Doctor.

813
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:51,979
You see Rahul, it is better if Hansa
doesn't meet him in this condition.

814
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:56,958
Yeah, she is really worried. I will
ask someone else to sit with the nurse.

815
01:26:57,219 --> 01:27:00,865
I can't assure you that an attack
won't happen. Anything can happen.

816
01:27:10,542 --> 01:27:14,188
Why didn't you ask Patel NOT to meet
Papa before leaving for Delhi.

817
01:27:14,448 --> 01:27:18,094
What?!? I had told him NOT to.
He still came?

818
01:27:20,792 --> 01:27:24,438
Please check
if the nurse needs anything.

819
01:27:27,542 --> 01:27:31,188
Papa paid him Rs. 30,000.

820
01:27:31,448 --> 01:27:38,848
I read out Dinesh's letter to Papa.
He has finalised the collaboration by himself.

821
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:53,396
Hansa, you shouldn't be around Papa
in this condition.

822
01:28:09,009 --> 01:28:11,676
01:27:49.750
Yeah, you know the firm's
address anyway.

823
01:28:11,936 --> 01:28:14,176
Please find out soon.

824
01:28:17,051 --> 01:28:20,697
No, I really don't know
who all deal with him.

825
01:28:21,467 --> 01:28:24,051
Of course, I will bear the expenses.

826
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:27,217
Nurse has a cold,
needs a little brandy.

827
01:28:27,478 --> 01:28:31,124
I only have whiskey.
Maybe this will do the trick?

828
01:28:34,259 --> 01:28:36,759
Shall I have a little too?

829
01:28:37,019 --> 01:28:40,665
Listen, you be with her only, okay?

830
01:28:54,551 --> 01:28:58,197
There's no brandy,
will this do?

831
01:28:58,926 --> 01:29:02,572
First class Scotch!
This is a really expensive whiskey.

832
01:29:17,842 --> 01:29:21,488
It's really good.
You should also try some.

833
01:29:21,749 --> 01:29:25,394
Why? It will look bad that's why?
-No, nothing like that.

834
01:29:25,655 --> 01:29:28,634
C'mon, go for it.

835
01:29:32,426 --> 01:29:34,634
You really like this?

836
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:48,197
She was totally delighted by it.
-So you should have given her some more.

837
01:29:48,457 --> 01:29:51,009
No way, she is a woman,
what if she gets drunk?

838
01:29:51,269 --> 01:29:53,426
she won't be able to handle too much.

839
01:29:58,884 --> 01:30:01,426
You really don't understand anything.

840
01:30:05,426 --> 01:30:07,217
What don't I get?

841
01:30:19,634 --> 01:30:23,280
I will take her to my room?
-What?

842
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:25,509
No way!

843
01:30:28,592 --> 01:30:32,238
What is the big deal?
-How can you even think like this?

844
01:30:32,926 --> 01:30:36,342
But you only gave her...
-You...

845
01:30:47,967 --> 01:30:50,884
Hansa, for Papa's sake,
please don't go there.

846
01:30:53,634 --> 01:30:57,280
Listen, doctor has also advised so.

847
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:01,186
And then, you need to take
care of yourself also.

848
01:31:07,842 --> 01:31:11,488
Janaki Bai, someone has come
to meet you.

849
01:31:15,717 --> 01:31:18,426
Khala passed away.
There has been a riot in the slums.

850
01:31:18,686 --> 01:31:20,509
What?!?

851
01:31:22,551 --> 01:31:25,176
Where were you when all
this was happening?

852
01:31:25,436 --> 01:31:29,082
You are protector of the law?
This is your protection?

853
01:31:29,717 --> 01:31:33,009
What can we do in this, sir?
These are all your own people.

854
01:31:33,717 --> 01:31:35,301
Forget it.

855
01:31:37,634 --> 01:31:39,842
Janaki is here.

856
01:31:41,801 --> 01:31:44,092
Look at what has happened. Look.

857
01:31:44,353 --> 01:31:47,999
And the police is blaming us only.
It was our doing, it seems.

858
01:31:48,384 --> 01:31:51,051
As if we burnt our own homes.

859
01:31:52,717 --> 01:31:55,676
Abdul?
-No.

860
01:32:15,967 --> 01:32:18,926
hey come, into the van.
-aye, why have you come here?

861
01:32:19,186 --> 01:32:21,426
Aye, come!
-Keep away, or I will kill you.

862
01:32:21,686 --> 01:32:23,967
Arre, come, come.
-Leave me.

863
01:32:24,228 --> 01:32:25,926
I will teach you a lesson
at the station.

864
01:32:26,676 --> 01:32:29,259
Where are you taking her?
- Leave, leave.

865
01:32:31,551 --> 01:32:33,460
Don't you dare touch her.

866
01:32:35,967 --> 01:32:37,592
Have you guys lost your mind?

867
01:32:37,853 --> 01:32:41,499
You treat someone who has lost their
near dear ones like this? Stupid...

868
01:32:43,217 --> 01:32:48,884
So this is your strategy. There my
people's homes are being burnt,

869
01:32:49,144 --> 01:32:52,790
and your people are harassing them?
Get me the commissioner,

870
01:32:53,051 --> 01:32:55,342
I will talk straight to him only.
Please.

871
01:32:57,342 --> 01:33:00,988
Did you hear that?
You guys spoil our image.

872
01:33:01,717 --> 01:33:03,835
I think that's enough.

873
01:33:06,884 --> 01:33:09,301
Now look at how they will
change their tone.

874
01:33:11,384 --> 01:33:14,436
Even now if they don't do anything,
come straight to me.

875
01:33:14,697 --> 01:33:16,322
Then I will see to it.

876
01:33:16,478 --> 01:33:18,634
Sir, we will give you
our fullest cooperation.

877
01:33:18,894 --> 01:33:20,801
You had better.

878
01:33:30,259 --> 01:33:32,676
Don't worry Kalyan,
I am there for you.

879
01:33:32,936 --> 01:33:35,092
I knew you will
straighten out these bastards.

880
01:33:36,551 --> 01:33:39,590
Namaste.... Namdeo
- Come Janaki.

881
01:33:57,717 --> 01:34:01,363
Namdeo, can you step out for a bit?

882
01:34:01,926 --> 01:34:03,488
Just a minute.

883
01:34:04,426 --> 01:34:05,988
Where's Abdul?

884
01:34:06,801 --> 01:34:09,134
Even at Khala's death,
he wasn't there.

885
01:34:11,176 --> 01:34:14,822
Why aren't you saying anything?
- Abdul is doing what he has to.

886
01:34:15,634 --> 01:34:18,676
At least he is not after the chair
just with a red flag like Kalyan.

887
01:34:22,509 --> 01:34:24,467
You step out,
I will be right there.

888
01:34:37,884 --> 01:34:40,217
You just worry about your Rahul Seth.

889
01:34:44,301 --> 01:34:47,947
If he has to play such a saint,
why is he still keeping Patel on?

890
01:34:53,259 --> 01:34:56,092
We have all together
killed Khala.

891
01:34:58,301 --> 01:35:00,217
You will bring a change
with your fury or what?

892
01:35:04,467 --> 01:35:06,176
Listen, listen...

893
01:35:45,259 --> 01:35:47,134
Please take care of this.

894
01:36:07,342 --> 01:36:10,988
You didn't pay this time.
Please do.

895
01:36:16,134 --> 01:36:18,759
You are a weird one.

896
01:36:19,019 --> 01:36:21,051
At first, you used to refuse money...

897
01:36:21,311 --> 01:36:22,874
...and now you are insisting on it?

898
01:36:57,009 --> 01:36:59,405
If he is asleep,
come to my room...

899
01:37:00,592 --> 01:37:02,217
...I have kept the bottle there.

900
01:37:02,478 --> 01:37:05,176
No, no, I have to give him
an injection in a bit.

901
01:37:05,436 --> 01:37:07,801
If I forget, it will be
really screwed up.

902
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:11,707
You think he will survive
because of the injection?

903
01:37:15,759 --> 01:37:17,384
Aye, come...

904
01:37:17,644 --> 01:37:19,926
We can't even talk here properly...
come...

905
01:37:20,842 --> 01:37:23,801
You go lie down,
if he isn't in pain...

906
01:37:24,061 --> 01:37:26,801
...and he keeps sleeping,
I shall come.

907
01:38:14,301 --> 01:38:16,947
Do you always have to
deal with such patients?

908
01:38:17,207 --> 01:38:19,551
As in?
- Old, dying...

909
01:38:21,759 --> 01:38:25,405
No.
- Don't you get fed up?

910
01:38:25,967 --> 01:38:28,592
No, no, sometimes
we get young patients too.

911
01:38:37,092 --> 01:38:40,238
Have some.
No?

912
01:38:59,342 --> 01:39:01,717
He doesn't let me come close to you.

913
01:39:04,259 --> 01:39:07,905
And here, there is no one
to take care of you.

914
01:40:25,967 --> 01:40:27,801
She was getting scared.

915
01:40:30,926 --> 01:40:32,488
Scared?

916
01:40:33,967 --> 01:40:35,717
Even I was scared.

917
01:40:37,301 --> 01:40:38,926
That's why let her go.

918
01:40:40,967 --> 01:40:42,884
But I am unable to forget...

919
01:40:44,426 --> 01:40:48,072
burnt huts, dying Khala.

920
01:40:55,801 --> 01:40:57,363
And your desire.

921
01:41:03,801 --> 01:41:06,738
You must be tired too,
Go sleep with Munna.

922
01:41:34,509 --> 01:41:36,342
Janaki, Janaki,

923
01:41:37,092 --> 01:41:39,176
What happened?
- Come here, fast.

924
01:42:02,676 --> 01:42:04,467
Must have passed away in his sleep.

925
01:42:06,426 --> 01:42:08,176
You weren't up?

926
01:42:10,801 --> 01:42:13,217
No, I mean, I had just slept.

927
01:42:13,717 --> 01:42:16,051
Yeah, yeah, must have passed
away in his sleep.

928
01:42:18,134 --> 01:42:21,072
Should we tell Rahul Seth?
- No, no,

929
01:42:21,467 --> 01:42:25,113
if he or the doctor
gets to know that I slept then...

930
01:42:27,092 --> 01:42:28,655
Janaki,

931
01:42:30,342 --> 01:42:32,092
Nobody will know anything.

932
01:42:33,509 --> 01:42:35,072
And he is a nice man.

933
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:37,947
He will forgive.

934
01:42:42,342 --> 01:42:43,905
Don't worry.

935
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:46,592
Now, nobody can separate us.

936
01:44:50,092 --> 01:44:51,801
Arre, you are completely wet?

937
01:44:53,426 --> 01:44:55,509
Arre, what happened?

938
01:44:56,509 --> 01:45:00,155
My car broke down on the way.
- Anita, please give him my Kurta.

939
01:45:00,415 --> 01:45:02,342
Pants won't help,
my pants can take two of him.

940
01:45:02,467 --> 01:45:04,030
I will give you my lungi.
Come...

941
01:45:04,290 --> 01:45:05,853
and I will prepare the XYZ.

942
01:45:06,301 --> 01:45:08,092
Today, we are having continental?
- Yeah, yeah.

943
01:45:10,426 --> 01:45:11,988
Yeah, will go well with these rains.

944
01:45:31,592 --> 01:45:33,634
I am getting reminded
of the things bygone...

945
01:46:13,217 --> 01:46:14,780
Russi, look...
wedding present.

946
01:46:15,884 --> 01:46:17,447
aww, it's beautiful...

947
01:46:22,134 --> 01:46:24,342
Russi, come for a bit..
Just explain this to me too...

948
01:46:25,634 --> 01:46:27,197
You are such a darling.

949
01:46:31,092 --> 01:46:32,717
You have given a really
expensive present.

950
01:46:33,842 --> 01:46:35,405
Yaar(buddy), you are also too much.

951
01:46:36,259 --> 01:46:39,905
You are one of the few real friends
I have. I won't even do this much?

952
01:46:40,165 --> 01:46:41,728
Anyway, come on...
- Yeah.

953
01:46:42,967 --> 01:46:46,613
I have prepared all this, & also made
a catalogue of prices and addresses.

954
01:46:50,592 --> 01:46:52,509
This will shut Dinesh up.

955
01:46:53,717 --> 01:46:55,801
You know that we tried really hard.

956
01:46:56,061 --> 01:46:58,009
But that expert is coming with Dinesh

957
01:46:58,269 --> 01:47:00,176
He will have the know-how
about the machines any which way.

958
01:47:01,134 --> 01:47:02,759
See these,
our wedding photographs.

959
01:47:03,717 --> 01:47:05,342
Anita, please. Not when
we are working, please.

960
01:47:08,717 --> 01:47:11,426
Yeah, so we need to get rid
of that expert in a day.

961
01:47:11,686 --> 01:47:13,249
But that expert is
coming with Dinesh

962
01:47:13,509 --> 01:47:16,092
Don't worry, once he sees
our reports, and our prices,

963
01:47:16,353 --> 01:47:17,915
he will be shocked out of his wits.

964
01:47:18,176 --> 01:47:19,738
Here, take a look.

965
01:47:25,176 --> 01:47:27,842
Rahul Seth has got cops
after our men.

966
01:47:29,092 --> 01:47:31,426
Son-in-law has lost it.

967
01:47:32,301 --> 01:47:35,947
I should meet Dinesh Sir,
before he returns to London.

968
01:47:37,467 --> 01:47:39,030
I wouldn't have come,

969
01:47:39,290 --> 01:47:40,853
but for the strong severe
questions about our machines.

970
01:47:41,759 --> 01:47:43,884
I am sorry but that's
the impression we had.

971
01:47:44,144 --> 01:47:47,790
Why Anita, why did we call him?
- If they can't supply what we need,

972
01:47:48,051 --> 01:47:49,926
they can go back.

973
01:47:50,186 --> 01:47:51,749
But what about the money
we have spent?

974
01:47:52,009 --> 01:47:54,467
When will his greed get over?
We have paid you for the estimate...

975
01:47:54,728 --> 01:47:56,551
It's NOT just the estimate,

976
01:47:56,811 --> 01:47:59,426
Dinesh will have to answer for
a lot of things.

977
01:47:59,686 --> 01:48:01,967
Only they know what's the deal
between Dinesh and them.

978
01:48:02,228 --> 01:48:04,592
Well, that's between you and him.

979
01:48:07,259 --> 01:48:10,051
Is there anything we can do for you?
- Yes,

980
01:48:10,311 --> 01:48:11,874
leave us alone.

981
01:48:21,134 --> 01:48:24,155
Please don't insist,
I can't come.

982
01:48:25,676 --> 01:48:29,322
Maybe Rahul can make it.
Please do talk to him.

983
01:48:35,926 --> 01:48:38,384
If you don't come for the meeting,

984
01:48:38,644 --> 01:48:40,842
then what will I be able to do alone?

985
01:48:43,426 --> 01:48:44,384
Hello, Rahul.

986
01:48:46,051 --> 01:48:48,967
oh, hello Dinesh.
You made it.

987
01:48:49,884 --> 01:48:51,676
It's good only.

988
01:48:51,936 --> 01:48:54,217
Even Hansa remains upset these days.

989
01:48:55,676 --> 01:48:59,322
I was suggesting that if Hansa
could make it to the factory tomorrow,

990
01:48:59,582 --> 01:49:02,342
then we can do the meeting.
She could chair it.

991
01:49:02,603 --> 01:49:06,249
What's the rush?
Papa only just...

992
01:49:07,092 --> 01:49:10,738
And at least you shouldn't be
talking shop to her right now.

993
01:49:10,999 --> 01:49:12,634
I am sorry.

994
01:49:12,967 --> 01:49:16,613
You only killed Papa,
both of you.

995
01:49:18,592 --> 01:49:22,238
You should leave,
Dinesh you too.

996
01:49:22,499 --> 01:49:26,144
Hansa, for God's sake,
please control yourself.

997
01:50:21,634 --> 01:50:23,092
She will be alright.

998
01:50:23,717 --> 01:50:26,717
Have a drink.
-No, thanks.

999
01:50:32,342 --> 01:50:35,988
Hansa was telling me that there was
no one with uncle that night.

1000
01:50:37,092 --> 01:50:38,676
Not even the nurse.

1001
01:50:41,217 --> 01:50:44,217
Even Hansa wasn't allowed to go there.

1002
01:50:45,592 --> 01:50:49,238
First, illness...
and then, death.

1003
01:50:53,342 --> 01:50:56,301
She isn't able to bear Papa's loss.

1004
01:51:00,884 --> 01:51:03,801
And on top, I myself am troubled.

1005
01:51:04,676 --> 01:51:08,322
I do understand that Rahul,
but we will have to decide.

1006
01:51:11,426 --> 01:51:14,613
I already have signed an agreement in London.
Now there is no question of going back on that.

1007
01:51:30,176 --> 01:51:32,717
The case against Patel has been withdrawn?

1008
01:51:32,978 --> 01:51:35,801
Who's speaking?
Who are you?

1009
01:51:37,217 --> 01:51:38,967
oh, Namdeo. Okay.

1010
01:51:40,426 --> 01:51:42,426
No, what can be done right now?

1011
01:51:43,259 --> 01:51:47,301
You come to my place tomorrow...

1012
01:51:47,561 --> 01:51:49,342
...in the night.

1013
01:52:08,051 --> 01:52:11,697
Patel and his goons have been given
money by someone for bribery.

1014
01:52:12,884 --> 01:52:16,009
Yeah, yeah, he had come to me.

1015
01:52:16,269 --> 01:52:18,342
As such I don't like him,

1016
01:52:18,603 --> 01:52:22,249
but he was uncle's loyal servant,
so I gave him some money.

1017
01:52:23,717 --> 01:52:25,592
He is such a loyalist...

1018
01:52:25,853 --> 01:52:29,499
...that he is seeing
a conspiracy in uncle's treatment.

1019
01:52:43,842 --> 01:52:45,676
Wouldn't you stay a while?

1020
01:52:45,936 --> 01:52:48,967
Anyway Patel
will have to be fixed somehow.

1021
01:52:49,228 --> 01:52:51,551
We have given him enough lift.

1022
01:52:52,301 --> 01:52:55,884
And now, we should encourage
Kalyan's union. What do you think?

1023
01:52:56,144 --> 01:52:59,217
Certainly.
Getting him out of the picture...

1024
01:52:59,478 --> 01:53:03,124
...will make the workers happy,
and he can also be kept shut.

1025
01:53:05,551 --> 01:53:09,197
See, this letter is from uncle,
in which he liked my plan.

1026
01:53:11,176 --> 01:53:13,551
If his wishes aren't respected,

1027
01:53:14,592 --> 01:53:16,384
then people will be unhappy.

1028
01:53:16,644 --> 01:53:19,467
It's better
if we talked about this later.

1029
01:53:20,926 --> 01:53:22,301
As you wish.

1030
01:53:54,842 --> 01:53:56,176
Janaki,

1031
01:53:56,436 --> 01:53:58,092
just come here for a bit.

1032
01:54:10,467 --> 01:54:13,551
See, there are so few flowers.

1033
01:54:13,811 --> 01:54:15,634
We need a LOT more.

1034
01:54:16,509 --> 01:54:18,967
My father will get only
so many flowers or what?

1035
01:54:20,842 --> 01:54:23,217
These I picked from his last rites.

1036
01:54:24,176 --> 01:54:27,426
Please go, get some more flowers.

1037
01:54:28,551 --> 01:54:30,009
but not of this colour,

1038
01:54:30,269 --> 01:54:31,592
Ma'am, you...

1039
01:54:31,853 --> 01:54:34,426
I knew you would understand my wishes.

1040
01:54:35,551 --> 01:54:37,426
Don't tell it to anyone.

1041
01:54:38,342 --> 01:54:41,176
Apart from you,
who else can understand me.

1042
01:54:42,842 --> 01:54:44,342
I will go pick up some,

1043
01:54:44,603 --> 01:54:46,259
flowers for you.

1044
01:54:56,842 --> 01:54:58,092
Arre, you?

1045
01:54:58,353 --> 01:55:00,092
Have you got Abdul's news?

1046
01:55:01,176 --> 01:55:03,801
Patel's goons have been
released by the police.

1047
01:55:04,384 --> 01:55:06,051
Dinesh Seth had given the money.

1048
01:55:09,426 --> 01:55:13,072
Patel was saying he will serve
foreign liquor on the ship,

1049
01:55:13,884 --> 01:55:15,259
to his comrades.

1050
01:55:16,717 --> 01:55:19,384
Asshole, calls his asslickers comrades.

1051
01:55:19,884 --> 01:55:21,301
Arre yes,

1052
01:55:21,561 --> 01:55:24,259
There's a place near Goti.

1053
01:55:24,842 --> 01:55:27,217
That is owned by Swaraji Dhani.

1054
01:55:28,134 --> 01:55:30,717
Patel has a drink with him every evening.

1055
01:55:35,342 --> 01:55:37,634
He had called my man there also once.

1056
01:55:38,592 --> 01:55:40,967
I was adamant that I shall also go.

1057
01:55:42,217 --> 01:55:44,467
Do you know why he was called?
To bribe him.

1058
01:55:47,259 --> 01:55:49,676
Do you really know where that place is?

1059
01:55:53,092 --> 01:55:55,092
If I go, I might be able to recognise it.

1060
01:55:55,353 --> 01:55:57,926
Janaki, this our chance to do something.

1061
01:56:00,551 --> 01:56:01,467
Please tell me you will come along?

1062
01:56:01,728 --> 01:56:03,884
Why do you want to ruin your life?

1063
01:56:04,384 --> 01:56:05,884
Janaki, please listen to me.

1064
01:56:06,426 --> 01:56:07,842
How is Abdul?

1065
01:56:08,384 --> 01:56:09,801
Hope he is alright.

1066
01:56:13,134 --> 01:56:16,176
Janaki,
Rahul Seth has called me tomorrow.

1067
01:56:18,384 --> 01:56:21,176
I am going to ask him straightforward
if he will protect us or not.

1068
01:56:26,051 --> 01:56:27,676
You will come, right?

1069
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:33,092
But tell me that you won't kill Patel.

1070
01:56:46,342 --> 01:56:49,509
I am unable to say,
I don't seem to remember...

1071
01:56:49,769 --> 01:56:50,801
You come sit in front.

1072
01:56:53,051 --> 01:56:55,259
No, let's go back.
This is a bad idea.

1073
01:56:55,519 --> 01:56:58,134
Janaki, don't screw things up.
We will be crushed completely.

1074
01:57:02,967 --> 01:57:06,613
When Patel had started all this,
he was like us only.

1075
01:57:07,176 --> 01:57:08,342
No, NEVER.

1076
01:57:09,884 --> 01:57:12,342
Janaki,
Abdul will NEVER forgive you.

1077
01:57:18,551 --> 01:57:19,592
Stop here.

1078
01:57:22,426 --> 01:57:23,967
That place is right there.

1079
01:57:24,301 --> 01:57:25,801
Turn the car around.

1080
01:57:50,176 --> 01:57:52,134
Grab hold of him.
Don't let him get away.

1081
01:57:59,676 --> 01:58:01,092
Please stop.

1082
01:58:01,634 --> 01:58:04,217
Narayan, don't beat him up.

1083
01:58:04,676 --> 01:58:08,009
STOP beating,
are you going to kill him or what?

1084
01:58:11,342 --> 01:58:13,592
Please let's just take
him from here at least.

1085
01:58:13,853 --> 01:58:16,092
Otherwise he will be
left here all night long.

1086
01:58:17,884 --> 01:58:20,134
Janaki, what are you saying?

1087
01:58:21,134 --> 01:58:23,967
You only will have to take
this burden on yourself.

1088
01:58:52,801 --> 01:58:55,259
Munna babu,
you are looking so adorable.

1089
01:58:55,519 --> 01:58:57,801
When he is older, the girls are
not going to let him be.

1090
01:58:58,801 --> 01:59:01,176
He will be surrounded
by ladies, like Krishna.

1091
01:59:01,436 --> 01:59:04,342
Of course, my darling.

1092
01:59:07,384 --> 01:59:10,801
Arre Munna babu,
you are looking so smart.

1093
01:59:11,061 --> 01:59:12,926
A little fireman, eh.

1094
01:59:13,186 --> 01:59:16,217
Come here dear, come to dad.

1095
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:21,176
See what Daddy has got for you.

1096
01:59:22,967 --> 01:59:24,301
Chocolate.

1097
01:59:24,561 --> 01:59:26,301
NO, don't dare touch Munna.

1098
01:59:26,561 --> 01:59:29,134
He is my son,
you will kill him too.

1099
01:59:29,759 --> 01:59:31,051
Hansa, what's happened to you?

1100
01:59:31,311 --> 01:59:32,884
DON'T touch Munna.

1101
01:59:33,144 --> 01:59:34,301
YOU...

1102
01:59:34,561 --> 01:59:35,676
Dinesh...

1103
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:37,634
Both of you are responsible
for killing him.

1104
01:59:38,759 --> 01:59:41,926
Munna, my son... nobody
can take you away from me.

1105
01:59:42,186 --> 01:59:43,967
Hansa, control yourself.
-DON'T TOUCH MUNNA!

1106
01:59:44,801 --> 01:59:46,509
Hansa, he is NOT ABLE TO BREATHE,

1107
01:59:46,769 --> 01:59:47,676
DON'T TOUCH HIM.

1108
01:59:47,936 --> 01:59:48,884
LEAVE HIM HASNA.

1109
01:59:55,926 --> 01:59:57,051
My Munna... come...

1110
02:00:06,592 --> 02:00:08,759
What... what has happened to you?

1111
02:00:09,759 --> 02:00:11,509
Dinesh had come...

1112
02:00:11,769 --> 02:00:14,217
He is no better than you...

1113
02:00:15,051 --> 02:00:22,306
He was saying that if I don't go to the meeting,
Munna wouldn't get a cent of his inheritance.

1114
02:00:22,566 --> 02:00:24,634
Bloody bastard...

1115
02:00:26,009 --> 02:00:27,884
But Munna is my son too...

1116
02:01:17,092 --> 02:01:19,801
Hansa will take a few days to recover.

1117
02:01:25,926 --> 02:01:28,842
In Lonavala, Munna shall
also be happy with you...

1118
02:02:02,676 --> 02:02:06,322
If need be, go to the post office,
and inform the post master...

1119
02:02:07,134 --> 02:02:10,342
He will intimate me immediately.
- Okay, give him a kiss.

1120
02:02:22,926 --> 02:02:25,176
Now even you have become a Madame.

1121
02:02:26,592 --> 02:02:30,238
Where? I a lifelong servant,

1122
02:02:31,342 --> 02:02:33,217
I will never become a Madame.

1123
02:02:33,478 --> 02:02:36,217
If you were a Madame, someone else
would have been a servant.

1124
02:02:36,478 --> 02:02:37,884
It would go on like that.

1125
02:02:42,967 --> 02:02:44,509
Munna has left?

1126
02:02:49,592 --> 02:02:54,509
yeah... He has gone to
Lonavala with Janaki Bai.

1127
02:02:55,217 --> 02:02:56,801
When you...

1128
02:03:01,592 --> 02:03:04,655
When you are completely well...

1129
02:03:04,915 --> 02:03:07,259
...we will call him back.

1130
02:03:10,384 --> 02:03:14,030
I will get better Rahul...
for sure...

1131
02:03:17,842 --> 02:03:20,092
I will give you all the pleasures...

1132
02:03:26,801 --> 02:03:30,592
Once more, my body yearns for you...

1133
02:03:34,592 --> 02:03:36,967
My body is getting titillations.

1134
02:03:40,717 --> 02:03:44,363
I have desires Rahul...
and you too...

1135
02:03:46,342 --> 02:03:48,342
You still do have the desire, don't you...

1136
02:04:09,176 --> 02:04:12,822
It all feels like a dream...

1137
02:04:45,634 --> 02:04:49,280
Hansa, once more I can feel myself.

1138
02:04:49,540 --> 02:04:52,092
Seems like I have gotten wings.

1139
02:04:52,353 --> 02:04:54,134
I can fly...

1140
02:04:54,967 --> 02:04:56,967
What an amazing feeling...

1141
02:04:57,804 --> 02:05:03,259
Now I understand as to how by giving
myself completely, I can have you...

1142
02:05:08,551 --> 02:05:09,967
Rahul,

1143
02:05:12,884 --> 02:05:16,530
Rahul, please get me this flower.

1144
02:05:26,009 --> 02:05:27,634
I will just get it.

1145
02:06:09,801 --> 02:06:12,551
No, let's go home.

1146
02:06:51,176 --> 02:06:55,342
come with me... sleep next to me...

1147
02:07:12,910 --> 02:07:16,035
come, come, o dear, come to me...

1148
02:07:55,564 --> 02:07:59,210
let my body bask in your breaths.

1149
02:13:21,243 --> 02:13:23,848
Hansa.

1150
02:14:37,783 --> 02:14:41,429
You and Janaki, look at
what you have done...

1151
02:14:41,689 --> 02:14:45,335
Don't drag her into this,
she isn't even here.

1152
02:14:45,595 --> 02:14:49,241
And when did you guys let Hansa breathe?

1153
02:14:52,284 --> 02:14:57,842
And you got a certificate from the Doctor
that she died naturally, not by suicide!

1154
02:15:08,262 --> 02:15:15,033
I had actually loved her, could anyone
take care of her-

1155
02:15:15,293 --> 02:15:19,981
neither the killer brother,
or even the father.

1156
02:15:20,760 --> 02:15:26,489
Nobody loved her like I did.

1157
02:15:26,750 --> 02:15:30,395
Today I can say all that...

1158
02:15:32,482 --> 02:15:34,302
Hansa,

1159
02:15:39,036 --> 02:15:42,682
did you shut your eyes,
to hear all this?

1160
02:15:48,626 --> 02:15:52,272
You don't need to explain to me,
I understand my responsibilities.

1161
02:15:54,137 --> 02:15:59,866
Of course, but we need to keep labour demands and the
company's productivity in consideration here, right?

1162
02:16:00,127 --> 02:16:06,898
With new machinery, the profits will increase,
and then the wages, bonus, and so on.

1163
02:16:07,158 --> 02:16:10,804
The increase in wage should be
proportional to profit increase.

1164
02:16:11,064 --> 02:16:14,710
If we do it in proportion,
how will the company grow?

1165
02:16:14,970 --> 02:16:18,616
And how much is the need of
the labourers anyway...

1166
02:16:18,877 --> 02:16:22,523
but still you will get higher wages,
more facilities...

1167
02:16:22,783 --> 02:16:27,470
but yeah, you shouldn't have any objection
to the firing of inefficient workers.

1168
02:16:30,406 --> 02:16:34,052
You will have to compensate them,
I can't let worker's rights be..

1169
02:16:35,513 --> 02:16:39,159
There's no need for
sloganeering here...

1170
02:16:39,419 --> 02:16:43,065
and if you talk about clauses,
then I will play such a move...

1171
02:16:45,407 --> 02:16:49,053
(TV/Radio) Because Patel was peaceful...

1172
02:16:49,577 --> 02:16:53,223
Step out for a bit.
I need to take this.

1173
02:16:53,535 --> 02:16:57,181
(TV/Radio) {Now he is lying paralysed,
but I can assure you of...}

1174
02:16:59,203 --> 02:17:02,849
...{what has happened with Patel,
won't let it happen to you...}

1175
02:17:03,638 --> 02:17:07,024
So on their instructions, Dinesh is
sending off the material here and there.

1176
02:17:09,108 --> 02:17:12,754
He can be jailed without a trial.

1177
02:17:13,948 --> 02:17:22,802
No, no, no, let's not involve police.
I will handle it myself, in my own way.

1178
02:17:28,638 --> 02:17:33,845
Anyway, he has left for
London today morning itself.

1179
02:17:34,106 --> 02:17:37,752
Let's see how that bastard comes back.

1180
02:17:38,012 --> 02:17:41,658
(TV/Radio) {Violence can only
be answered by violence.}

1181
02:17:42,440 --> 02:17:46,086
That is why I have always loved you...

1182
02:17:46,347 --> 02:17:49,992
and have treated you like equals.
And will always do.

1183
02:17:51,539 --> 02:17:55,185
Today the new machinery
being installed in the factory...

1184
02:17:55,445 --> 02:17:58,294
is with the same feeling.

1185
02:17:58,555 --> 02:18:02,201
You all should be able to earn the maximum,
that is why this step.

1186
02:18:04,482 --> 02:18:08,128
For those who will have
to leave their jobs...

1187
02:18:08,388 --> 02:18:13,076
and I am talking about the elders,
not the good-for-nothings...

1188
02:18:13,336 --> 02:18:16,982
they shall be compensated
properly for sure.

1189
02:18:17,242 --> 02:18:20,888
So come,

1190
02:18:21,149 --> 02:18:26,878
let's all together, swear
that each of us will work more...

1191
02:18:27,138 --> 02:18:32,867
Everyone will increase productivity,
everyone shall strive towards more bonus.

1192
02:18:33,128 --> 02:18:38,405
Every one will help us.
Everyone will work towards country's development.

1193
02:18:38,665 --> 02:18:42,311
Satyamev Jayte.
(victory of the truth)

1194
02:18:44,958 --> 02:18:48,604
I want to assure you Kalyan that
my conditions are for your benefit only...

1195
02:18:49,876 --> 02:18:53,522
I mean the worker's benefit.

1196
02:18:54,566 --> 02:18:58,212
I will convince the workers
about your conditions.

1197
02:19:46,299 --> 02:19:49,944
Who's that?

1198
02:19:50,205 --> 02:19:53,851
Don't be scared Janaki, it's me...
-Abdul?

1199
02:19:54,111 --> 02:19:57,757
Come from the front door.

1200
02:20:04,369 --> 02:20:08,015
I heard that you are here,
I couldn't stop myself.

1201
02:20:11,351 --> 02:20:14,997
Wait, I will just come.

1202
02:20:17,604 --> 02:20:22,291
It's not possible to move out of
the village where we are working in.

1203
02:20:22,552 --> 02:20:26,198
A comrade had come in from the city,
he mentioned that you are here,

1204
02:20:26,458 --> 02:20:30,104
so I just came..

1205
02:20:30,364 --> 02:20:34,010
What should I get you?
- what?

1206
02:20:34,270 --> 02:20:37,916
Just a minute...

1207
02:20:41,067 --> 02:20:44,713
Why all this?
-I had just kept it for Munna...

1208
02:20:47,014 --> 02:20:50,660
What were you up to all these days?

1209
02:20:53,026 --> 02:20:56,672
Well, what should I tell you...

1210
02:20:56,932 --> 02:21:00,578
I can't even tell you.

1211
02:21:00,838 --> 02:21:04,484
Let it be, don't tell.

1212
02:21:06,925 --> 02:21:11,612
Don't cry, please forgive me Janaki..

1213
02:21:11,873 --> 02:21:15,518
No, nothing like that.
I couldn't help it seeing you after so long.

1214
02:21:22,774 --> 02:21:26,419
Take some.
- Everyone praises you...

1215
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:31,545
Without you, getting rid of Patel
would have been tough.

1216
02:21:32,940 --> 02:21:36,586
Please let's talk about something else.

1217
02:21:51,532 --> 02:21:55,803
Sleep now. There's no problem
till the morning.

1218
02:21:56,063 --> 02:21:59,709
Have to sleep till the morning only,
if I can sleep that is.

1219
02:22:00,637 --> 02:22:04,283
One feels like being up
in such a nice breeze.

1220
02:22:04,926 --> 02:22:08,572
Sometimes I dream...

1221
02:22:08,832 --> 02:22:12,478
I have taken you with me to the village.

1222
02:22:14,238 --> 02:22:19,967
I can go along with you, but then
we won't be able to feed...

1223
02:22:22,731 --> 02:22:26,377
...either us, or our children.

1224
02:22:27,105 --> 02:22:30,751
but the work you are doing,
is something that you like to do...

1225
02:22:31,011 --> 02:22:34,657
will you be able to let go of that?

1226
02:22:34,917 --> 02:22:38,563
Then you will blame me only.

1227
02:22:38,824 --> 02:22:42,469
Maybe you are right.

1228
02:22:42,948 --> 02:22:50,760
I will work here, if nothing,
at least my Seth (master) pays well...

1229
02:22:51,020 --> 02:22:54,666
keeps me well..

1230
02:22:56,868 --> 02:22:59,614
Now Munna's mother has also died.

1231
02:22:59,875 --> 02:23:03,520
He cannot stay a moment without me.

1232
02:23:04,159 --> 02:23:07,805
All his responsibility is for me only.

1233
02:23:09,466 --> 02:23:13,112
Whenever you can,
please do come see me.

1234
02:23:14,810 --> 02:23:18,456
Now you should sleep,
it is quite late.

1235
02:23:19,235 --> 02:23:22,881
I will wake you up tomorrow morning.

1236
02:23:23,141 --> 02:23:26,787
When will all this get over?

1237
02:24:12,825 --> 02:24:16,470
Janaki Bai, I am taking
Munna to the station.

1238
02:24:16,731 --> 02:24:20,377
Come back soon, don't let him
wander too much in the sun.

1239
02:24:59,213 --> 02:25:03,515
Rahul Seth, I was just wondering as
to when you will come...

1240
02:25:04,668 --> 02:25:08,314
How is Munna?
-Gone to the station...

1241
02:25:08,575 --> 02:25:12,220
...to see the train.
You had come to see Munna?

1242
02:25:12,481 --> 02:25:16,127
See these flowers,
how they have blossomed.

1243
02:25:21,423 --> 02:25:25,068
I wish I could stay longer...

1244
02:25:25,329 --> 02:25:28,975
You have to leave today?

1245
02:25:29,235 --> 02:25:32,881
At least spend the night...

1246
02:25:45,202 --> 02:25:48,848
The police is investigating
about Patel's beating.

1247
02:25:53,348 --> 02:25:56,993
Dinesh had met the nurse,
he is suspicious of Seth ji's death.

1248
02:25:59,050 --> 02:26:02,695
The cops are also looking for you.

1249
02:26:02,956 --> 02:26:06,602
Police?
But I haven't done anything.

1250
02:26:06,862 --> 02:26:10,508
Seth ji was already unwell,

1251
02:26:10,768 --> 02:26:14,414
and I am the one who saved Patel.
I did just what you told me to.

1252
02:26:16,258 --> 02:26:19,904
I knew that you would say this only.

1253
02:26:20,861 --> 02:26:24,507
If the nurse slept off, what's my fault.
And you are the one...

1254
02:26:25,475 --> 02:26:29,120
This is not the truth.
You know that it isn't.

1255
02:26:33,303 --> 02:26:37,990
And even if it were,
you are the one who did.

1256
02:26:41,481 --> 02:26:43,569
Rahul Sir,

1257
02:26:47,235 --> 02:26:50,881
I will take you to the station,
Munna is there himself,

1258
02:26:51,141 --> 02:26:54,787
I will take him with me.

1259
02:26:55,325 --> 02:26:58,970
Munna must be just coming back...

1260
02:27:31,116 --> 02:27:39,538
Sir, please don't hand me over to the police.
They shall kill me, just like my father.

1261
02:27:39,799 --> 02:27:43,444
How can you even think of that Janaki?

1262
02:27:43,705 --> 02:27:47,351
That is the reason I have come here so that
you can run away before the cops come.

1263
02:27:48,866 --> 02:27:53,966
Where will I run to Sir,
please just hide me here somewhere.

1264
02:27:54,227 --> 02:27:57,873
I will do as you would please...
I will take care of Munna...

1265
02:27:58,133 --> 02:28:01,779
No need to pay me also.

1266
02:28:02,059 --> 02:28:05,705
Please just protect me here only sir.

1267
02:28:05,965 --> 02:28:09,611
You can't stay here.
If they see you here,

1268
02:28:09,872 --> 02:28:13,517
they will suspect me.
- So you just care about yourself,

1269
02:28:13,778 --> 02:28:17,424
doesn't matter what happens to me.
You have underestimated me...

1270
02:28:17,684 --> 02:28:19,825
...I shall tell everyone everything.

1271
02:28:20,085 --> 02:28:23,731
Who will believe a servant,
over their master... Law??

1272
02:28:36,723 --> 02:28:39,730
If you need some clothing or food,
go ahead take it...

1273
02:28:40,078 --> 02:28:43,724
Now you can't stay here.

1274
02:28:44,653 --> 02:28:48,299
If needed, I can drop you off somewhere.

1275
02:28:49,388 --> 02:28:53,034
I will figure out
my own way and destination.

1276
02:28:53,294 --> 02:28:56,940
then come on, you need to leave
before Munna comes back.

1277
02:31:57,833 --> 02:32:01,113
Yes Madame, what is your order now?

1278
02:32:02,448 --> 02:32:06,093
I am hungry...

1279
02:32:11,818 --> 02:32:16,328
I have resolved now... whoever
gives the order, I shall obey.

1280
02:32:16,588 --> 02:32:20,234
We have anyway taken birth
to follow orders only.

1281
02:32:21,544 --> 02:32:25,190
Your case is different.

1282
02:32:25,451 --> 02:32:29,097
Am really starving.

1283
02:32:29,357 --> 02:32:33,003
Namdeo, please give me something to eat.

1284
02:32:33,409 --> 02:32:37,055
Is there anything?

1285
02:32:37,315 --> 02:32:40,961
Hunger... yeah..
please sit down..

1286
02:32:51,185 --> 02:32:54,831
Water...

1287
02:33:18,107 --> 02:33:21,753
Now there's nothing more to eat...
these medicines are there...

1288
02:33:24,174 --> 02:33:27,819
Don't even know for which
disease these are for...

1289
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:31,726
Removes all hunger...

1290
02:33:40,747 --> 02:33:44,392
Abdul got caught.

1291
02:33:45,203 --> 02:33:48,849
Abdul got caught??!!!??
How...

1292
02:33:51,783 --> 02:33:55,429
You didn't protect him??!!??
Tell me..

1293
02:33:57,092 --> 02:34:00,738
What was he supposed to do..

1294
02:34:05,708 --> 02:34:09,354
I only should have agreed...

1295
02:34:09,614 --> 02:34:14,614
When he had come over to see me,
he proposed that we leave for somewhere...

1296
02:34:21,117 --> 02:34:24,763
It is my fault only.

1297
02:34:25,024 --> 02:34:28,669
No Janaki, not yours...

1298
02:34:28,930 --> 02:34:32,576
our fault...

1299
02:34:37,431 --> 02:34:40,017
Our leaders who care
only about the chair...

1300
02:34:42,878 --> 02:34:46,524
He only trapped Abdul.

1301
02:34:46,784 --> 02:34:50,430
He is instigating in fighting amongst us.

1302
02:34:52,168 --> 02:34:55,814
I have to get these medicines to them,
to save the lives of our comrades...

1303
02:34:56,075 --> 02:34:59,720
And he is playing
with their lives only...

1304
02:35:01,692 --> 02:35:05,338
I feel that before he
is able to do anything,

1305
02:35:05,599 --> 02:35:09,244
I only should beat him to death.

1306
02:35:16,045 --> 02:35:19,691
Don't even know if he
is there any more or not.

1307
02:35:22,054 --> 02:35:25,700
Now what will you do?

1308
02:35:31,603 --> 02:35:35,249
The water supply
is only there during the night,

1309
02:35:36,241 --> 02:35:39,887
only then you will be able to bathe.

1310
02:35:40,906 --> 02:35:44,552
I shall meanwhile,
arrange something to eat.

1311
02:36:00,854 --> 02:36:04,500
I have come from London with
an urgent message from Dinesh.

1312
02:36:05,700 --> 02:36:08,153
C'mon, show it to me.

1313
02:36:08,413 --> 02:36:12,966
Written would have been more dangerous
for you, it is better oral...

1314
02:36:14,985 --> 02:36:18,631
How do you know Dinesh?

1315
02:36:18,891 --> 02:36:22,537
We are partners
in this business organization.

1316
02:36:25,025 --> 02:36:28,670
That's great!

1317
02:36:30,503 --> 02:36:34,149
He observed a lot of things...

1318
02:36:34,409 --> 02:36:38,055
Your involvement in Patel's beating up.

1319
02:36:38,315 --> 02:36:41,961
Nurse - the alcohol,
Janaki Bai...

1320
02:36:42,222 --> 02:36:45,867
Even I have observed a lot of things.

1321
02:36:46,128 --> 02:36:49,774
Like the Patel-Dinesh involvement
in the communal riots.

1322
02:36:50,945 --> 02:36:56,675
The scandal that your International
Business organization does...

1323
02:36:58,365 --> 02:37:02,011
These things can be settled patiently...

1324
02:37:02,272 --> 02:37:05,917
It isn't very late even now.

1325
02:37:06,178 --> 02:37:09,824
We can make a deal about
the international organization,

1326
02:37:10,084 --> 02:37:13,730
but till these guys are watching us,
it's impossible to talk about anything.

1327
02:37:17,401 --> 02:37:21,047
We are because of them only.
If these guys want, we can be nobodies,

1328
02:37:21,307 --> 02:37:24,953
like they did with Dinesh.

1329
02:37:25,213 --> 02:37:28,859
Lights off.

1330
02:37:42,372 --> 02:37:48,101
Namdeo, Namdeo.
- Don't hit me...

1331
02:38:57,483 --> 02:39:02,170
There's nothing worse than fear.
Doesn't leave you alone even during sleep

1332
02:39:13,602 --> 02:39:17,248
I should go give him medicines.
Maybe someone needs it.

1333
02:39:23,715 --> 02:39:27,361
But what if I go with the medicines,

1334
02:39:27,622 --> 02:39:31,267
and they target me only?

1335
02:40:12,623 --> 02:40:17,102
You should tell Dinesh that if he
comes here, he will be straight into jail.

1336
02:40:18,057 --> 02:40:22,744
It will be better for him if he just
hands over his factory share to me.

1337
02:40:23,005 --> 02:40:26,651
Otherwise,

1338
02:40:26,911 --> 02:40:30,557
otherwise, it wouldn't take time for your
smuggling and other activities to get revealed.

1339
02:40:32,600 --> 02:40:35,600
What activities?

1340
02:40:35,927 --> 02:40:41,573
Maybe you aren't aware, but we work for a
foreign govt with full transparency.

1341
02:40:44,989 --> 02:40:48,635
Full transparency?
About diamonds, money, weapons...

1342
02:40:48,895 --> 02:40:52,541
If the govt here tries to interfere,
there will be diplomatic ruckus.

1343
02:40:55,153 --> 02:40:58,799
You have broken the laws of this country,

1344
02:40:59,059 --> 02:41:02,705
and now your people aren't even in power.

1345
02:41:03,130 --> 02:41:06,776
If the papers publish anything about this,
then no one will be able to save you.

1346
02:41:10,600 --> 02:41:14,245
Okay,

1347
02:41:15,254 --> 02:41:18,900
Dinesh can hand over his shares to you,

1348
02:41:19,160 --> 02:41:22,806
he is happy there.

1349
02:41:23,066 --> 02:41:26,712
Without a doubt.
Anyway, if he comes back...

1350
02:41:26,973 --> 02:41:30,618
you guys aren't going to let him be.
- What is the price of your silence?

1351
02:41:33,727 --> 02:41:37,373
Only that Dinesh stays out.
That's it.

1352
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,646
Dinesh should sign this and send it to us.

1353
02:41:46,507 --> 02:41:52,153
A cab is waiting for you downstairs.
- Thank you.

1354
02:42:41,527 --> 02:42:45,173
What's your opinion in all of this?
- Which one- the crime, or the film?

1355
02:42:45,433 --> 02:42:49,079
Whichever one you want to assume,
anyway what is the distinction between...

1356
02:42:49,339 --> 02:42:52,985
the crime and the film.
- Yeah right,

1357
02:42:53,245 --> 02:42:56,891
You journalists say
whatever you feel like.

1358
02:43:25,214 --> 02:43:28,860
Don't be here anymore.
We don't know what will happen.

1359
02:43:29,120 --> 02:43:32,766
No, I ain't going anywhere.

1360
02:43:35,478 --> 02:43:39,124
See, you are going to get caught
in trouble without any reason.

1361
02:43:40,051 --> 02:43:43,697
Please listen to me,
leave from here.

1362
02:43:48,932 --> 02:43:54,661
I am not going anywhere,
You go and give these medicines.

1363
02:43:57,002 --> 02:44:00,648
But,
- Nothing will happen.

1364
02:47:20,526 --> 02:47:24,172
Janaki, where had you vanished?

1365
02:47:24,680 --> 02:47:28,326
Wait Janaki, I have to tell you a lot...

1366
02:47:29,816 --> 02:47:33,462
All our problems have now gone away.

1367
02:47:34,328 --> 02:47:37,974
This time
do not leave things unsettled...

1368
02:47:38,234 --> 02:47:41,880
Why don't we say all that,
all that which remained unsaid.

1369
02:47:42,808 --> 02:47:46,454
Everything unsaid... how?

1370
02:47:46,714 --> 02:47:50,360
You kept looking for Hansa in me.

1371
02:47:51,812 --> 02:47:55,458
You were blind to everything...
neither Hansa,

1372
02:47:55,718 --> 02:47:59,364
nor me...
With your own lies,

1373
02:47:59,625 --> 02:48:03,270
you keep rejecting things.

1374
02:48:03,531 --> 02:48:07,177
Even we can see a bit of truth.
How can you keep me tied with...

1375
02:48:07,437 --> 02:48:11,083
a lie.

1376
02:48:20,865 --> 02:48:23,858
Why are you terming this as lying?
However you want it,

1377
02:48:24,118 --> 02:48:27,764
you will have it...
Money, respect, happiness...

1378
02:48:28,025 --> 02:48:31,670
And Munna is also desperate for you.
Can you come back from him?

1379
02:48:31,931 --> 02:48:35,993
He keeps talking of you.
Truly Janaki, just come back once.

1380
02:48:40,066 --> 02:48:43,712
Why are you laughing?
Don't you recognise me?

1381
02:48:44,534 --> 02:48:49,951
How will I not recognise you?
I have seen you inside out...

1382
02:48:50,211 --> 02:48:53,857
Your real self...
Scared...

1383
02:48:54,117 --> 02:48:57,763
When you weren't able to play your role,
then I was able to see...

1384
02:48:58,024 --> 02:49:01,669
that white patch
which you were hiding behind yourself.

1385
02:49:03,291 --> 02:49:06,937
Without knowing you,
how can one see through you anyway.

1386
02:49:07,198 --> 02:49:10,843
Just a little fault of mine,
and I didn't do it intentionally.

1387
02:49:31,507 --> 02:49:35,153
Don't leave Janaki, now after having
you, I don't want to lose you.

1388
02:49:38,830 --> 02:49:42,476
You don't even understand
what you lost.

1389
02:49:43,948 --> 02:49:47,593
And what you understood and had,
you were ready to take it's life.

1390
02:49:50,531 --> 02:49:54,177
Our inner selves are very cruel,

1391
02:49:54,437 --> 02:49:58,083
let me be on my own.

1392
02:49:58,343 --> 02:50:01,989
I won't say anything to anyone.

1393
02:50:02,250 --> 02:50:05,895
You leave... I am not Janaki.
- Then who are you?

1394
02:50:07,112 --> 02:50:10,758
You tell me as to how can I know you?

1395
02:50:11,018 --> 02:50:14,664
You won't be able to...

1396
02:50:14,925 --> 02:50:18,570
You will be all alone in your path,
that's your fate.

1397
02:50:19,935 --> 02:50:23,581
We are the first rays of the dawn.

1398
02:50:23,841 --> 02:50:27,487
Getting us is like being able to
capture wind in your hand.

1399
02:50:39,279 --> 02:50:42,925
