2
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:12,071
What are you doing?

3
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:21,083
Hello!
What the hell are you doing?

4
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:23,888
I'm enjoying a chocolate.

5
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,217
This is an ad for Chocolate,
not Condoms.

6
00:02:26,493 --> 00:02:27,152
Next!

7
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:28,592
You cops are a joke.

8
00:02:28,895 --> 00:02:30,385
Chuck your uniforms...

9
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:32,762
...and wear a leash around
your neck like Balwant Rai's pets.

10
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,094
You basket!

11
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:37,464
My foot! My Foot! My Foot!

12
00:02:38,572 --> 00:02:41,507
In this lawless city your uniform
can bully only the weak.

13
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:42,707
Handcuff only the oppressed.

14
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:44,607
Where're you going?
Listen to me.

15
00:02:44,711 --> 00:02:47,771
I'll drag you to the court
you gotta bet for this! You basket!

16
00:02:47,814 --> 00:02:51,511
We want to see you, Sunny Arora,
not superstar Sunny Deol.

17
00:02:52,486 --> 00:02:53,418
Okay, sir.

18
00:02:53,487 --> 00:02:54,511
Ma!

19
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:56,813
I am back, Ma.

20
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,125
Look. Your son has become
a big man, Ma.

21
00:03:00,627 --> 00:03:03,460
Now you won't have to
wash dishes anymore, Ma.

22
00:03:05,198 --> 00:03:08,190
I've brought your favorite
yellow saree too.

23
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:09,526
Ma!

24
00:03:09,703 --> 00:03:11,330
Why don't you say something, Ma?

25
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:13,496
Ma!

26
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,197
Ma!

27
00:03:18,278 --> 00:03:20,041
I'm just leaving.
Wearing my shoes.

28
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,017
So...

29
00:03:25,552 --> 00:03:27,110
Who will win Asia Cup this time?

30
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,814
I've no time for useless crap.

31
00:03:30,123 --> 00:03:31,317
Useless crap!

32
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,654
The whole country watches it.
Are we all useless?

33
00:03:33,927 --> 00:03:35,360
And do I look useless to you?

34
00:03:36,062 --> 00:03:37,723
Have you managed to make
any progress yet?

35
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:40,556
I gave an audition yesterday.

36
00:03:40,767 --> 00:03:42,564
Casting Director loved it.

37
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,560
I'm sure I'll get this part

38
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:45,728
You will see.

39
00:03:46,573 --> 00:03:47,938
Hey, buddy!

40
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:51,073
Can you lend me some money,
please?

41
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:53,839
I need to pay my phone bill.

42
00:03:58,151 --> 00:03:59,641
We need an A.D. On our shoot.

43
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,944
Wanna do it?

44
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:02,949
Me... an Assistant Director?

45
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:05,788
So? Superstar Hrithik Roshan
was an A. D.

46
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:07,723
Farhan Akhtar was an A. D.

47
00:04:07,861 --> 00:04:10,523
Aamir Khan- AD. Emran Hashmi- AD.
Ranbir Kapoor- AD.

48
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:12,455
They all are superstars today.

49
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:15,599
One learns the nuances of acting
only behind the camera.

50
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,768
What say?

51
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:19,561
This reputation.

52
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:20,698
This wealth.

53
00:04:20,774 --> 00:04:21,604
This fame.

54
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:24,266
It took your father 40 years
to earn it.

55
00:04:25,178 --> 00:04:28,614
And it took you 4 minutes
to ruin everything

56
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:33,879
Without thinking about your
in-laws or your husband.

57
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:38,082
Perhaps I made a mistake
in your upbringing.

58
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:39,119
Ma!

59
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:40,290
Enough, no more!

60
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:42,526
Find your happiness...
but away from here.

61
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,794
You're now a stranger to us.

62
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,398
Cut it!

63
00:04:49,035 --> 00:04:50,627
Excellent, Ma'am.
Excellent!

64
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:52,032
Thank you.
- You were mind-blowing!

65
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:53,972
Make up!
- Mandy...

66
00:04:54,975 --> 00:04:56,567
So insipid, man
- Why?

67
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:59,936
Where's the 'feel'?
You know... 'feel'!

68
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:01,936
Mandy!

69
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:03,182
Hey, listen!

70
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,908
Wanna do an outdoor shoot?

71
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,185
For a movie?

72
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:11,216
Will you get me a part?

73
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:13,120
I swear, I'll give you my mother's
heirloom bangles."

74
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,250
Shut up, film-worm

75
00:05:14,527 --> 00:05:15,960
It's a documentary film.

76
00:05:16,329 --> 00:05:17,557
A foreign crew is making it.

77
00:05:18,064 --> 00:05:20,055
An AD-cum-Production boy
is required.

78
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,864
A month in Rajasthan...

79
00:05:21,935 --> 00:05:23,334
...and you'll be set for six months.

80
00:05:23,937 --> 00:05:25,336
They pay in dollars, you see.

81
00:05:25,739 --> 00:05:26,467
Great!

82
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:27,733
We have to leave after Holi.

83
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:28,933
You on?

84
00:05:29,643 --> 00:05:31,372
When's Holi?
When is it?"

85
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:33,844
When's Holi?

86
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,398
"Nights may get tired"

87
00:05:58,505 --> 00:06:01,963
"Dreams are sleepless"

88
00:06:06,446 --> 00:06:10,212
"Nights may get tired"

89
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:14,319
"Dreams are sleepless"

90
00:06:14,421 --> 00:06:17,618
"Do not lose your heart, my friend"

91
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:22,253
"Fill your heart with mad fervour"

92
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,391
"Destiny may taunt you, fear not!"

93
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:34,099
"Take a flight!
Take a leap of faith!"

94
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:42,143
"Take a flight!
Take a leap of faith!"

95
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,148
"Don't sigh and whine."

96
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,150
"Don't drink yourself to death."

97
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:48,117
"Don't get into squabbles."

98
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:50,155
"I only want my home."

99
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,155
"No wandering here and there."

100
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,159
"I see the world."

101
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,091
"Nothing is hidden from my eyes."

102
00:06:56,162 --> 00:06:58,221
"Dance in the world and sing heartily."

103
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:10,307
"My dreams bully me"

104
00:07:10,577 --> 00:07:13,842
"Show me the finger,
and summon me"

105
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:17,713
"My wallet contains only dreams"

106
00:07:17,784 --> 00:07:22,050
"Spicy, succulent and crisp!"

107
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,520
"Destiny may taunt you, fear not!"

108
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:34,295
"Take a flight!
Take a leap of faith!"

109
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,262
"I love my Champa Champa."

110
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,303
"I love my Champa Champa."

111
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:50,180
"My dreams are colorful
and so dear to me"

112
00:07:50,383 --> 00:07:58,222
"Give wings to my heart
and fly away"

113
00:08:01,327 --> 00:08:06,424
"My dreams are colorful"

114
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:11,297
"My dreams are colorful"

115
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:14,437
"I love my Champa Champa."

116
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,713
Hey, stop this damn shooting.

117
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:25,982
Confiscate the camera.

118
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:27,551
Put all their stuff in the Jeep.

119
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,652
How dare you shoot
in the border area...

120
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:32,818
...without permission?

121
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,785
Who is your Heroine?

122
00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:38,156
Ms. Bipasha Basu!

123
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,531
Without my permission...

124
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:43,427
...even a bird can't flutter
it's wings here.

125
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:45,637
How'd you shoot here?

126
00:08:46,005 --> 00:08:46,994
But sir, we...

127
00:08:47,073 --> 00:08:48,870
We have the permission
from the Ministry...

128
00:08:49,008 --> 00:08:51,408
...that we can shoot anywhere
in Rajasthan.

129
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:53,602
All of Rajasthan?

130
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:55,474
Then go ahead... but not in the
border area.

131
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:57,673
But not here.
Here... no!

132
00:08:57,884 --> 00:08:59,784
But it says we can...
We can shoot anywhere?

133
00:08:59,886 --> 00:09:01,786
So, unless we don't...

134
00:09:02,055 --> 00:09:04,683
...block the traffic or cause
inconvenience for the locals?

135
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,383
You just did.

136
00:09:06,693 --> 00:09:08,888
Here you are, here is my vehicle.

137
00:09:08,995 --> 00:09:10,690
All of you are standing here.
That makes it a jam.

138
00:09:11,164 --> 00:09:13,029
And what did you say...
inconvenience?

139
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:15,191
But, sir, at least take a look
at the documents.

140
00:09:15,268 --> 00:09:18,203
Central Government has given us
permission to shoot in Rajasthan.

141
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:19,904
Ugh, who are you?

142
00:09:20,006 --> 00:09:21,303
I don't talk to girls.

143
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,498
Confiscate the equipments.

144
00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:24,770
I said "no shooting".

145
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,473
Dump their stuff in the Jeep.

146
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:28,711
Take the camera away.
Take it! Take it all.

147
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:31,175
Sir, I've been asking
these guys...

148
00:09:31,251 --> 00:09:33,981
...to get permission from
the Local Police Station.

149
00:09:34,187 --> 00:09:35,085
But no.

150
00:09:35,188 --> 00:09:37,281
He's the real Ministry.

151
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,784
Lord of this land.

152
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:41,224
He's a Parliament in himself.

153
00:09:41,461 --> 00:09:43,088
So what if you are an American?

154
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:44,925
You may have influence in the Press.

155
00:09:45,431 --> 00:09:48,127
Look at them, they're here
to make film on infiltration!

156
00:09:48,201 --> 00:09:49,930
Sir, word is...

157
00:09:50,103 --> 00:09:52,128
...that infiltration is happening
at the borders.

158
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:53,928
That too with the help of locals.

159
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:55,333
And not just that.

160
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,471
Some Government Officials...

161
00:09:57,543 --> 00:09:59,204
...and few Police Officers
are also involved, sir.

162
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,144
Oh, the infiltration...
- But, sir...

163
00:10:01,214 --> 00:10:04,308
Without your permission, even
a bird can't flutter it's wings here.

164
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,011
Then how can there be
any infiltration?

165
00:10:06,252 --> 00:10:07,514
No uhh...
- Am I right, sir?

166
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,554
You see infiltration is actually...

167
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:10,723
Sir, sir!

168
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:12,350
Why don't you say it on camera?

169
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,653
Your strong baritone should
echo in the whole world.

170
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:16,156
Let me set up the camera.

171
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,090
What are you waiting for?

172
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:19,822
It's His Majesty's interview.

173
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:22,034
Sir, should we shoot?

174
00:10:22,969 --> 00:10:24,061
Now what should I say...

175
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,723
Now you can take the camera.

176
00:10:45,158 --> 00:10:49,652
Hey, put the camera down.
Go ahead with your shooting.

177
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,987
Sure?
- Sure. I've said it.

178
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:53,994
Did you hear that?
We can shoot now.

179
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,001
Now you've the permission
from the Ministry.

180
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:57,796
Thank him, guys.

181
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,394
What thanks?

182
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:01,697
It's our duty.

183
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:06,110
Sunny, we're taking the Jeep.

184
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,510
You follow us in the director's car
as you finish.

185
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,910
And be careful.
There're equipments inside.

186
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,413
Yes, my lady!
- And come soon.

187
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:16,915
"You go, I'll follow"

188
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,014
Hey, come on!

189
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,284
"You go...

190
00:11:20,393 --> 00:11:22,327
...l'll follow"
Oh, no!

191
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:26,027
A wheel inside a wheel.
A car over a wheel.

192
00:11:26,332 --> 00:11:29,768
The car is my ride.

193
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:32,700
A little behind, a little aside...

194
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:36,537
A little behind, a little aside...

195
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:40,772
A wheel inside a wheel.
A car over a wheel.

196
00:11:40,847 --> 00:11:44,146
The car is my ride.

197
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:47,942
A little behind, a little aside...

198
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,921
A little behind, a little aside...

199
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:00,865
Now you are going to
hear a fun-filled song.

200
00:12:01,401 --> 00:12:03,528
The lyrics have been
written by Mr. Bakshi.

201
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:06,034
Lakshmikaant Pyaarelal
have composed the music.

202
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:08,139
Lata Mangeshkar has sung the song.

203
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,774
And the name of the movie is Bobby.

204
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:27,489
Excuse me!

205
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:28,823
Excuse me!

206
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:00,046
Brother!
They are here.

207
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:14,989
What's this?

208
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,899
Eh... brother...
- What is this?

209
00:14:19,539 --> 00:14:20,767
What the hell have you got?

210
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:23,936
Where are the Americans?

211
00:14:25,511 --> 00:14:27,308
Brother, according to
our information...

212
00:14:27,547 --> 00:14:28,605
...they were supposed to be
in the car.

213
00:14:28,681 --> 00:14:30,546
But you couldn't see anything
in the dark, right?

214
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:41,483
Can he be of any use to us?

215
00:14:43,796 --> 00:14:45,229
They were Americans.

216
00:14:46,532 --> 00:14:47,396
Media persons.

217
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,391
The government would have
agreed to...

218
00:14:50,803 --> 00:14:52,771
...our demands for an
American hostage.

219
00:14:55,141 --> 00:14:56,802
Who'll give a sparrow's fart
for him?

220
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:03,838
So what do we do with him?

221
00:16:06,846 --> 00:16:08,575
This village has very cute kids.

222
00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:12,314
Few of our men will be
your guests...

223
00:16:13,185 --> 00:16:14,482
...for a week.

224
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:18,248
I hope you won't mind.

225
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,654
What's your name, son.
- Mehtaab.

226
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:24,587
Such a sweet name!

227
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:26,129
Who's kid is he?

228
00:16:26,232 --> 00:16:28,291
Sir, he's my son.

229
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:30,599
So, what do you say?

230
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:32,726
Do you mind?

231
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:35,403
We won't mind, sir.

232
00:16:35,741 --> 00:16:37,140
Please consider this your
own village.

233
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:41,343
Go on kids... play.

234
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:55,721
Keep an eye on the hostage.

235
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:58,454
We hope to return soon...

236
00:16:59,365 --> 00:17:00,627
...along with Americans.

237
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:03,966
Good bye!
- Good bye!

238
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:36,566
Jawaad.

239
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,364
Sir! Sir!

240
00:17:39,372 --> 00:17:41,067
Why have you brought me here,
sir?

241
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,800
Sir! Hello!

242
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,072
Sir!
Why don't you say anything?

243
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:48,477
Sir!

244
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:49,781
Sir!

245
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:51,408
Please tell me something?

246
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,785
Why don't you tell me something,
sir.

247
00:17:57,223 --> 00:17:59,418
I think, you have made a mistake.

248
00:18:00,226 --> 00:18:03,320
I'm not who you think I am.

249
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:07,293
Why don't you say something?

250
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:08,800
Sir!

251
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,099
Look!

252
00:18:10,302 --> 00:18:11,997
You can't keep me here forcibly.

253
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:13,564
Let me go.

254
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:14,703
Sir!

255
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:26,616
Go.

256
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:31,351
Go.

257
00:18:57,783 --> 00:18:59,876
Son, go give it to him.

258
00:19:08,494 --> 00:19:09,893
Brother, food.

259
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:28,977
I think my phone is with you.

260
00:19:35,421 --> 00:19:37,719
Along with my shooting gear...

261
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,790
The magazines are in there too.

262
00:19:42,928 --> 00:19:44,589
My shooting gear is here, right?

263
00:20:06,285 --> 00:20:07,217
What is this?

264
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,848
Sir, it's a film magazine.

265
00:20:12,691 --> 00:20:14,750
You probably thought
its the kind you use.

266
00:20:15,227 --> 00:20:17,491
By the way, our equipment
is very similar

267
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,829
You shoot, we also shoot.

268
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,691
You use magazines, so do we.

269
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:25,368
You have Machine Gun.

270
00:20:25,538 --> 00:20:26,630
We use Sun Gun.

271
00:20:26,972 --> 00:20:29,167
We make films and you watch...

272
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:30,740
No.

273
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:33,843
In Pakistan your films are banned.

274
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,974
What?

275
00:20:37,082 --> 00:20:38,310
This is Pakistan?

276
00:20:38,517 --> 00:20:39,848
Haven't you realized yet?

277
00:20:40,386 --> 00:20:43,253
How? The houses, food and
the people all look the same.

278
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:44,749
How would I've known?

279
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:53,297
I don't even have a passport!

280
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,896
How will I go back home?

281
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:07,746
PAKISTANI FOLK SONG;
Stealthily, I stole into your heart...

282
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:26,023
INDIAN vERSION OF THE SONG:
We are apart and...

283
00:21:26,131 --> 00:21:31,159
...the musty night burns so slowly!

284
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:41,202
Stop! Just stop here.

285
00:22:41,507 --> 00:22:42,804
That's it.

286
00:22:43,108 --> 00:22:44,370
Give me the bag, sir.

287
00:22:44,443 --> 00:22:46,104
Allah be praised!

288
00:22:46,512 --> 00:22:47,843
Finally I am home.

289
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:53,846
Thank you, sir.
From here I will walk it up.

290
00:22:54,386 --> 00:22:55,785
You just enjoy yourself.

291
00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:58,118
Watch all three films today itself.
Allah forgive me...

292
00:22:58,257 --> 00:23:00,384
...but watching a movie before
it's release is a different high.

293
00:23:00,993 --> 00:23:03,689
That's fine but when are you
giving me the real stuff.

294
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:05,127
The English stuff.

295
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:09,130
Soon. God willing, you'll have
them as soon as they arrive.

296
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,799
I've a few of those French ones too!

297
00:23:12,271 --> 00:23:13,329
In case you want them...

298
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:15,435
Like we understand bloody English.

299
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:17,935
We might as well watch French.
- True, sir.

300
00:23:18,343 --> 00:23:21,210
As it is in such movies, dialogues
and stories are all the same.

301
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:23,839
But of course,
faces keep changing.

302
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,508
Make sure the stuff is A grade.

303
00:23:25,617 --> 00:23:26,914
Sir, it will be first class.

304
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:28,884
Have I ever given you
a chance to complain?

305
00:23:29,054 --> 00:23:32,717
Okay, good bye.
Okay, sir. Bye.

306
00:23:49,975 --> 00:23:50,964
Hey!

307
00:23:51,443 --> 00:23:52,171
Who are you?

308
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:53,268
- Sir, I am...
- Who are you?

309
00:23:53,378 --> 00:23:54,743
Speak. Who are you?

310
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:56,039
Why don't you talk?
- No, no... - Speak up!

311
00:23:56,148 --> 00:23:57,046
What's in that bag?

312
00:23:57,082 --> 00:23:58,709
It's my goods, sir.

313
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,183
Open... Open the bag!

314
00:24:00,285 --> 00:24:02,276
There are just CDs.
Let me show you.

315
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:03,649
Look, just CDs.

316
00:24:03,922 --> 00:24:05,321
Nothing else.

317
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:07,784
Take a look.

318
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:10,657
Nothing else.
- Brother Aftab! Brother!

319
00:24:10,863 --> 00:24:11,989
This is my little Brother.

320
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:13,925
He's my son.

321
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,758
He has to travel for work.

322
00:24:16,135 --> 00:24:17,534
He's just returned home.

323
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:20,595
Move.

324
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:36,747
First become our guest parasites.
Then give us attitude!

325
00:24:37,556 --> 00:24:39,080
I wonder when they'll go.

326
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,086
A week, indeed!
That's what they said.

327
00:24:42,127 --> 00:24:43,788
God knows, how long will they stay.

328
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:46,087
And why have they kidnapped
that Indian?

329
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,031
They intended to kidnap an American,
instead got him.

330
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:55,698
Poor fellow does something
in cinema.

331
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:57,603
They brought his equipments too.

332
00:24:59,111 --> 00:25:00,237
Cinema?
- Yes.

333
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:01,939
Where is his gear?

334
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:03,114
Over there.

335
00:25:19,431 --> 00:25:20,659
Awesome!

336
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,760
Have something to eat.

337
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,563
I'll give you water too.

338
00:25:31,877 --> 00:25:32,809
Here you go.

339
00:25:37,683 --> 00:25:38,843
Should I get you more ketchup?

340
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:41,885
How is it?

341
00:25:42,588 --> 00:25:43,612
Delicious.

342
00:25:45,224 --> 00:25:46,156
Right,

343
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:49,220
so do you have a film camera?

344
00:25:51,697 --> 00:25:53,790
Are you a Cameraman
or Director?

345
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,691
I am an actor by passion.

346
00:25:57,436 --> 00:25:59,028
But an Assistant Director
by profession.

347
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:03,070
You see, the nuances of acting
are learnt behind the camera.

348
00:26:03,375 --> 00:26:04,967
You are going great,
I swear.

349
00:26:05,377 --> 00:26:07,470
Hrithik Roshan was an
Assistant,

350
00:26:08,013 --> 00:26:09,913
So was Farhan Akhtar.

351
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:11,774
Emraan Hashmi, Aamir Khan...

352
00:26:12,017 --> 00:26:13,882
And Rishi Kapoor's son,
what's his name?

353
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,317
Ranbir Kapoor.
- Yeah.

354
00:26:16,488 --> 00:26:18,649
Man, your industry is full of
those Kapoors.

355
00:26:19,024 --> 00:26:20,924
Point is... they were all assistants.

356
00:26:21,193 --> 00:26:24,060
And today, they're all superstars.

357
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:26,192
Man, you know a lot about
our Bollywood?

358
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:27,922
Even I'm from the same profession.

359
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:29,525
Making movies.

360
00:26:29,701 --> 00:26:31,100
Put one DvD in the computer...

361
00:26:31,336 --> 00:26:33,236
...and a few more spring out.

362
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:35,835
Thank to Allah, I have made lots
of money from your films.

363
00:26:36,308 --> 00:26:37,935
So you are into film piracy?

364
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:40,436
Guess what...

365
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:42,739
I watch most films on DvD too.

366
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:43,610
Really?

367
00:26:43,715 --> 00:26:46,309
Not just me, half our industry does.

368
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:48,885
And the super educated watch
pirated world cinema.

369
00:26:49,454 --> 00:26:52,082
In short, everyone's a pirate.

370
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:54,121
Look, bottom-line...

371
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:58,695
...it's the only way we get to
watch movies from the other side.

372
00:26:59,531 --> 00:27:02,329
My father is a great fan of
Sir Yusuf.

373
00:27:02,668 --> 00:27:04,431
In fact, he's a devotee.

374
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,130
He's also from Peshawar, see

375
00:27:06,371 --> 00:27:07,633
You mean our Dilip Kumar.

376
00:27:07,706 --> 00:27:09,936
Call him Dilip or Yusuf,
it's the same thing

377
00:27:10,442 --> 00:27:12,535
All grudges against the neighboring
country fall aside when comes to films.

378
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:14,976
We just love watching your films,
man.

379
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,780
In any case politics is beyond
the common man...

380
00:27:22,354 --> 00:27:24,185
And beyond these wolves.

381
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:50,134
What are you looking at?

382
00:28:50,642 --> 00:28:52,269
Here, wear it.

383
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:54,477
It's mine, might not fit you well.

384
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:55,976
But wear it anyway.

385
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,609
I will never forget this favor
all my life.

386
00:28:59,484 --> 00:29:01,577
How long is your life anyway?

387
00:29:01,987 --> 00:29:03,284
A few days more at best.

388
00:29:03,822 --> 00:29:07,815
I'm doing myself a favor 'cos
you smell like a sewer.

389
00:29:08,427 --> 00:29:09,485
Come on, wear them.

390
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:11,153
Aftab.

391
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:14,362
Brother, which way is India?

392
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:15,890
Why?

393
00:29:16,401 --> 00:29:17,629
Are you planning to escape?

394
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:20,167
No, just asking.

395
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:24,164
It's that way.

396
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,877
Wear them.

397
00:31:30,502 --> 00:31:32,402
If you're heading towards Lahore,
then climb on.

398
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:33,533
We'll drop you there.

399
00:31:34,206 --> 00:31:35,104
Lahore?

400
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,564
Yes.

401
00:31:37,409 --> 00:31:39,741
Yes. Lahore's that way.

402
00:31:40,612 --> 00:31:42,170
India is on the other side.

403
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:47,917
Next time you won't get water.

404
00:32:16,081 --> 00:32:17,070
So, buddy!

405
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:19,272
Back from your morning walk?

406
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:23,949
So ungrateful?

407
00:32:24,856 --> 00:32:27,552
Do me a favor,
kindly don't do me any favors!"

408
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,452
Ah, my Salman Khan!

409
00:32:32,797 --> 00:32:34,662
I deliberately sent you that way.

410
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,098
Had you gone the other way,
you'd be dead right now.

411
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:39,965
Both sides are heavily patrolled.

412
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:41,831
They shoot at sight.

413
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:44,271
They don't even ask whether
you're Indian or Pakistani.

414
00:32:45,477 --> 00:32:50,073
Brother, once you cross the border
it's easier to just live here.

415
00:32:50,815 --> 00:32:52,442
It's very difficult to go back.

416
00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:54,474
Then how do they keep crossing-over?

417
00:32:54,819 --> 00:32:56,081
Don't you go too?

418
00:32:56,187 --> 00:32:58,246
See, you're a common man.

419
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:00,820
And a common man is insignificant.

420
00:33:01,493 --> 00:33:05,395
For you its best that you do
as they say.

421
00:33:05,864 --> 00:33:07,491
It's for your benefit.

422
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,494
You ruined the entire wall.

423
00:33:10,802 --> 00:33:11,928
What an amazing plan!

424
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:13,329
Go on, run again.

425
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:16,002
I spent my money for nothing.

426
00:33:20,445 --> 00:33:21,673
Shut up everyone.

427
00:33:21,813 --> 00:33:24,247
I am starting the film,
shut up. Sit down.

428
00:33:57,315 --> 00:34:00,182
I love you...

429
00:34:02,153 --> 00:34:05,554
I love you...

430
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:12,088
I love you...

431
00:34:30,882 --> 00:34:32,213
Brother! Brother!

432
00:34:32,317 --> 00:34:34,080
They're watching 'Maine Pyar Kiya'.

433
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:35,479
Salman Khan's film!

434
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:37,881
Brother, I want to watch it too.

435
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:39,113
Please let me go.

436
00:34:39,891 --> 00:34:41,688
I'll return as soon as the
film's over. I swear!

437
00:34:42,026 --> 00:34:43,391
It's my favorite film.

438
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:44,592
Brother...

439
00:34:45,130 --> 00:34:46,154
Listen, please...

440
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:55,901
"After all, your father
and mine are friends too."

441
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:59,204
"Look, this cap is meant for
friendship. Isn't it?"

442
00:35:03,314 --> 00:35:04,110
"Thank you."

443
00:35:04,783 --> 00:35:06,614
Friendship has a rule, ma'am!

444
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:08,543
No sorry, no thank you.

445
00:35:08,787 --> 00:35:09,776
Okay?

446
00:35:10,121 --> 00:35:10,951
"Okay."

447
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:13,112
"Prem:

448
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,587
"A boy and a girl can never be
just friends."

449
00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:19,194
This is just a cover...

450
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:21,999
...for those burning flames
of desire...

451
00:35:22,066 --> 00:35:25,160
...in throbbing hearts on those
cold, cold nights.

452
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:29,773
"O'Pigeon! Go... go... go..."

453
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:33,874
"O'Pigeon! Go... go... go..."

454
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,474
"Favor?"

455
00:35:37,882 --> 00:35:41,477
"You did me a favor
by keeping my daughter here?"

456
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:45,348
"Is that what you call friendship
these days?"

457
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:48,384
"No, buddy!"

458
00:35:49,294 --> 00:35:50,818
"I don't want your favor.

459
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:52,896
I will pay for your
five-star hotel...

460
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:56,296
...where you let my daughter stay.

461
00:35:56,835 --> 00:36:00,271
So what are your boarding
and lodging charges?

462
00:36:00,472 --> 00:36:01,632
Five thousand?

463
00:36:01,806 --> 00:36:02,795
Ten thousand?

464
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,065
Twenty thousand?

465
00:36:04,409 --> 00:36:05,842
Fifty thousand?

466
00:36:06,244 --> 00:36:07,768
Tell me Kishen Kumar Chaudhary!
Tell me!

467
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,889
Brother, please let me
watch the film.

468
00:36:27,332 --> 00:36:28,321
I have a personal record...

469
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:31,266
I never miss a show of
"Maine Pyar Kiya". Never.

470
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:34,029
Brother Mehmood,
please let me watch it.

471
00:36:34,138 --> 00:36:36,504
I swear, I'll return
as soon as the film ends.

472
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:38,872
Where can I run?
I already failed once.

473
00:36:38,943 --> 00:36:41,537
If you don't let me,
you will find me dead.

474
00:36:41,646 --> 00:36:43,443
Jawaad, let this donkey go!

475
00:36:43,948 --> 00:36:45,347
He's chewed my brains!

476
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:46,547
Take him away!

477
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:53,887
I love you...

478
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:56,816
"Papa!"

479
00:36:59,297 --> 00:37:01,424
"I don't need two square meals."

480
00:37:02,033 --> 00:37:03,933
"Is this fair?"

481
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:08,831
"He toiled hard for a month
on an empty stomach...

482
00:37:09,107 --> 00:37:10,768
...and earned this money."

483
00:37:11,576 --> 00:37:13,703
"You don't see his calloused hands...

484
00:37:13,878 --> 00:37:16,108
...his pain stricken tears."

485
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:20,249
"All you can see are these
rain soaked notes."

486
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:21,080
"Daughter!"

487
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:22,709
"Papa, if this money has no value...

488
00:37:22,787 --> 00:37:24,755
...then everything in this world
is worthless."

489
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:28,583
"Nothing has value, father"

490
00:37:29,394 --> 00:37:30,986
"It's worthless."

491
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:36,194
"Please don't mind her words, sir."

492
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:39,595
What's wrong?
Where's the sound?

493
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,862
What happened?

494
00:37:41,906 --> 00:37:44,272
Aftab do something,

495
00:37:44,475 --> 00:37:45,999
Pipe down!

496
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:49,008
Shall I wear a skirt,
enter the screen and dance?

497
00:37:49,314 --> 00:37:50,872
This is how pirated DvDs are.

498
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:52,715
If want to watch wait,
or shove off.

499
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:55,752
Hey, sit down!
Touchy bugger.

500
00:37:56,187 --> 00:37:57,745
I am trying.

501
00:37:59,891 --> 00:38:02,086
"Then nothing is of value
in this world."

502
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:05,524
"Nothing is of value, father."

503
00:38:06,564 --> 00:38:08,225
"It's worthless."

504
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:13,295
"Please don't mind her words..."

505
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:17,301
Not again.
What's wrong now?

506
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,036
Be quiet.

507
00:38:19,577 --> 00:38:21,807
Do something.

508
00:38:21,913 --> 00:38:24,905
Just a minute.
The sound will be fixed.

509
00:38:24,949 --> 00:38:26,348
Hang on!

510
00:38:26,451 --> 00:38:27,645
Just a minute.

511
00:38:27,752 --> 00:38:28,912
What can he do?

512
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:30,151
May I try something?

513
00:38:30,254 --> 00:38:31,721
What will you do?

514
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:32,981
Give me a shot

515
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:36,021
When Sunny's here... why fear?

516
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:37,593
Go ahead.

517
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:42,592
"It's worthless."

518
00:38:45,036 --> 00:38:48,995
Please don't mind her words,
sir..."

519
00:38:49,874 --> 00:38:50,966
It's my love...

520
00:38:51,342 --> 00:38:53,776
...which is making her lose calm.

521
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:56,045
Give me another chance, sir.

522
00:38:57,348 --> 00:38:58,645
Just one chance.

523
00:39:00,952 --> 00:39:02,852
Once again I'll earn.

524
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:04,580
I will earn that money again.

525
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:06,581
And this time I promise you, sir.

526
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,357
I promise...

527
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,793
...that the notes won't get wet.

528
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:12,556
The notes won't get wet, sir

529
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:16,355
"I love you"

530
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:18,967
Great.

531
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:25,808
Wow!
This guy is complete entertainment.

532
00:39:53,671 --> 00:39:55,002
What is your name?

533
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,872
The whole village knows
me as Sunny.

534
00:39:58,209 --> 00:40:01,144
Mona, what's the capital
of Arizona?

535
00:40:01,245 --> 00:40:03,076
Robert.
Smart boy.

536
00:40:03,147 --> 00:40:05,411
Lilly, don't be silly.

537
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:08,045
What's going on?
Run away, scram.

538
00:40:09,887 --> 00:40:12,685
Explain this to him, man.

539
00:40:13,024 --> 00:40:13,888
Explain.

540
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:16,623
Such toys are common.

541
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:21,526
What is not common is the
courage needed to use them.

542
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:24,361
You can only be born
with that courage.

543
00:40:24,702 --> 00:40:27,432
When I strike someone with
my two and a half kilogram arm...

544
00:40:27,705 --> 00:40:28,967
that man doesn't get up...

545
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,439
"He goes up!"

546
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:31,869
He goes up!

547
00:40:32,176 --> 00:40:33,768
Do Mogambo!

548
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,640
Mogambo... is pleased.

549
00:40:39,383 --> 00:40:42,682
"Mogambo... is so pleased."

550
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:45,348
What's the ruckus?
Get lost!

551
00:40:46,591 --> 00:40:47,751
What's wrong, sir?

552
00:40:47,992 --> 00:40:49,926
They're just kids having fun.

553
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:52,392
They are the real patrons
of a true artist.

554
00:40:52,497 --> 00:40:54,260
Shut up!
You buffoon!

555
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:55,191
Brother!

556
00:40:55,333 --> 00:40:58,461
One day this buffoon will stun
everyone with his performance.

557
00:40:58,569 --> 00:40:59,866
He'll send ripples in Bollywood.

558
00:40:59,971 --> 00:41:02,166
Shut up.
You and your wretched Bollywood.

559
00:41:02,473 --> 00:41:04,873
Look, Brother.
You can curse me all you want...

560
00:41:05,009 --> 00:41:06,874
...but not to my film industry.

561
00:41:07,111 --> 00:41:08,908
If our industry is so wretched...

562
00:41:09,113 --> 00:41:11,911
...why is Aftab's piracy business
doing so well?

563
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:14,509
We're ashamed of such people.

564
00:41:15,987 --> 00:41:17,181
And you stop being so cheerful.

565
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:18,814
Your alive on our charity.

566
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:21,915
I spit on charity.

567
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,818
I shall defeat you.
I assure you.

568
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:32,130
But the gun, the bullet and even
that moment in time shall be mine!

569
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:34,762
Fine, brother...

570
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:37,205
You call the gun, bullet and time...

571
00:41:37,241 --> 00:41:39,971
...but when you call me,
I'll be right there.

572
00:41:42,113 --> 00:41:43,546
Hey, Brother!

573
00:41:43,648 --> 00:41:45,616
Brother! Brother! Brother!

574
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,012
Let him go.

575
00:41:47,118 --> 00:41:49,052
Why're you letting this idiot
bother you. Let's go.

576
00:41:49,654 --> 00:41:50,643
Swine.

577
00:41:54,926 --> 00:41:56,223
Are you all right?

578
00:41:56,627 --> 00:41:57,753
You hurt?

579
00:41:58,629 --> 00:42:01,723
I wish I knew he's allergic
to jokes.

580
00:42:02,266 --> 00:42:02,994
Joke?

581
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:05,200
You nuts?

582
00:42:05,770 --> 00:42:08,068
You never joke with someone
who holds a gun.

583
00:42:08,673 --> 00:42:10,072
Don't you know this basic thing?

584
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:12,267
Just created a ruckus.

585
00:42:19,483 --> 00:42:26,286
How kills me...
O' Lord, he just kills me...

586
00:42:57,788 --> 00:42:59,483
Greetings!
- Greetings!

587
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,317
Big brother has sent us here.

588
00:43:01,926 --> 00:43:03,587
We need to send a recording
of the hostage.

589
00:43:03,728 --> 00:43:05,127
All right. Jawaad...

590
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:10,231
Hey.

591
00:43:11,135 --> 00:43:12,329
Step out.

592
00:43:13,804 --> 00:43:14,600
Come on.

593
00:43:21,279 --> 00:43:22,610
We need to make a recording of you.

594
00:43:23,414 --> 00:43:26,474
You'll appeal to your Government
in front of the camera that...

595
00:43:26,817 --> 00:43:28,682
...they accept all our demands.

596
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:30,686
Otherwise we will kill you.

597
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:34,324
Cool.
I'll make an appeal.

598
00:43:34,892 --> 00:43:37,087
This might actually be my last
opportunity to face the camera.

599
00:43:38,529 --> 00:43:39,928
Shall we start, brother?

600
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:42,228
Yeah.
Let's record him.

601
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:48,971
Brother, it's you who has to
do the recording.

602
00:43:50,041 --> 00:43:50,973
What is this?

603
00:43:52,076 --> 00:43:54,442
I never touched
this wretched thing.

604
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:55,875
Jawaad.

605
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:58,144
Here, you handle this.

606
00:43:58,783 --> 00:44:02,344
Brother, I don't know
how to use this thing either.

607
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:12,928
Neither do I.
Please manage somehow.

608
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:16,392
Then you should've come prepared

609
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:18,567
Should have learnt and come.

610
00:44:18,669 --> 00:44:20,660
Look, I did as I was told.

611
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:23,468
Now arguing unnecessarily
won't yield anything.

612
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:26,805
Let's find a solution, brother.

613
00:44:27,511 --> 00:44:30,139
We'll have to do the recording.
It's Big brother's order!

614
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:35,374
Lf... you permit, may I shoot?

615
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:38,485
I mean, record.

616
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:45,953
This... This is what I want.

617
00:44:46,731 --> 00:44:48,528
It should look like a film, sir.

618
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:51,433
Never compromise on quality.

619
00:44:51,836 --> 00:44:53,167
Even if it's a small film...

620
00:44:53,237 --> 00:44:54,704
...the efforts should come
from the heart.

621
00:44:55,306 --> 00:44:56,796
Bring the tripod.

622
00:45:01,212 --> 00:45:02,941
Camera.

623
00:45:05,816 --> 00:45:06,942
Here it is.

624
00:45:13,924 --> 00:45:15,983
So, brother,
you will call 'Roll'.

625
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:18,925
And Brother, you press this.

626
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:19,963
And say, Rolling. Okay?

627
00:45:20,031 --> 00:45:22,625
And as soon as he says Rolling,
you say Action!

628
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,365
Got it?

629
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:26,428
Ready for take?

630
00:45:26,771 --> 00:45:27,601
What?

631
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:29,863
I mean, shall we start?

632
00:45:30,975 --> 00:45:32,169
Yes.

633
00:45:38,449 --> 00:45:39,074
Yes.

634
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:41,643
Brother,
what do I've to say?

635
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:44,787
Just say what he told you earlier.

636
00:45:45,356 --> 00:45:47,483
Okay, let's start.

637
00:45:49,093 --> 00:45:50,082
Roll.

638
00:45:51,195 --> 00:45:52,355
Rolling.

639
00:45:52,897 --> 00:45:53,989
Acting.

640
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,226
Whoever's watching this video...

641
00:45:57,368 --> 00:45:59,233
...I appeal to them...

642
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:02,065
...to accept all their conditions.

643
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:05,472
...otherwise they will kill me.

644
00:46:07,878 --> 00:46:08,902
Cut it.

645
00:46:09,113 --> 00:46:10,512
Whoever is watching this video...

646
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:12,707
I appeal to them...

647
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:15,382
...to accept all their conditions.

648
00:46:15,486 --> 00:46:18,853
Otherwise they will kill me.

649
00:46:20,057 --> 00:46:21,718
It's not up to the mark.

650
00:46:22,927 --> 00:46:26,385
Hmmm... We'll have to try
something else.

651
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:28,797
Roll.

652
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,794
Rolling.

653
00:46:30,835 --> 00:46:32,200
Acting.

654
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:34,631
Whoever is conditioning this video
I appeal to them...

655
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:35,865
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

656
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,666
Repeat.

657
00:46:38,409 --> 00:46:39,273
Roll.

658
00:46:39,477 --> 00:46:40,307
Rolling.

659
00:46:40,744 --> 00:46:41,836
Acting.

660
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:44,210
Whoever is watching the conditions...

661
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:46,608
Once more.
Once more.

662
00:46:47,151 --> 00:46:48,641
Roll.
- Rolling.

663
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:50,152
Acting.

664
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:54,422
Roll.

665
00:46:54,625 --> 00:46:55,523
Rolling

666
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:57,117
Acting.

667
00:46:58,929 --> 00:47:00,362
Roll!
- Rolling!

668
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:01,622
Acting!

669
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:03,829
Whoever's watching this video...

670
00:47:03,934 --> 00:47:07,028
...I appeal to them that...
I... I...

671
00:47:09,874 --> 00:47:10,898
Roll.

672
00:47:11,675 --> 00:47:12,573
Rolling.

673
00:47:12,676 --> 00:47:13,665
Acting.

674
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:16,842
I know what the problem is

675
00:47:17,114 --> 00:47:18,445
These aren't my lines.

676
00:47:18,549 --> 00:47:19,641
I shouldn't be saying them.

677
00:47:20,117 --> 00:47:21,880
You should be saying them,
brother.

678
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:24,519
Brother, give him the lines.

679
00:47:24,955 --> 00:47:26,650
Okay?
Go.

680
00:47:29,527 --> 00:47:31,893
Brother, a real actor is one...

681
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:35,454
...who makes a scene come alive
even without dialogues.

682
00:47:35,966 --> 00:47:36,864
You know?

683
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:41,961
(Speaks in Persian language)

684
00:47:42,473 --> 00:47:43,565
Cut. Cut. Cut.

685
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:45,908
Brother.
What are you saying?

686
00:47:46,911 --> 00:47:48,469
Who is your target audience?

687
00:47:48,879 --> 00:47:51,279
If they don't understand
what you're saying...

688
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:53,213
...then what's the point?

689
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:56,880
Call someone sensible, man?

690
00:48:09,767 --> 00:48:11,564
If you value his life...

691
00:48:12,136 --> 00:48:14,036
...then accept all our conditions.

692
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:16,097
...otherwise we will behead him.

693
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:20,808
By God!

694
00:48:21,812 --> 00:48:23,609
What intensity!

695
00:48:28,185 --> 00:48:29,243
Aftab!

696
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,185
Are you only interested in piracy
or... even films?

697
00:48:33,457 --> 00:48:35,652
Well, my interest in films
brought me to piracy.

698
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:36,927
I see.

699
00:48:37,761 --> 00:48:40,355
This picture says
you wanted to be a star.

700
00:48:40,564 --> 00:48:41,622
Where did you find that?

701
00:48:41,665 --> 00:48:44,600
So why didn't you ever
pursue acting?

702
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:46,066
This isn't India, Mister...

703
00:48:46,337 --> 00:48:49,670
...where talent is recognized
or acknowledged

704
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:52,939
Even if it is,
it's not remunerated.

705
00:48:53,844 --> 00:48:56,142
Pakistan's brimming with talent...

706
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,080
but lacks patronage like
Indians get.

707
00:48:59,883 --> 00:49:01,544
That's why our great artists...

708
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:04,381
...cross over there to earn
more fame and fortune.

709
00:49:05,456 --> 00:49:06,548
Jawaad Brother.

710
00:49:07,091 --> 00:49:08,456
Since when have you been
crossing over?

711
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,592
Was this a childhood aspiration or?

712
00:49:12,463 --> 00:49:13,487
Oh, yeah, where did you
spend your childhood?

713
00:49:13,797 --> 00:49:14,456
In a religious school.

714
00:49:16,166 --> 00:49:17,656
My father was Mosque caretaker.

715
00:49:18,902 --> 00:49:20,392
We prayed five times a day...

716
00:49:21,105 --> 00:49:23,232
...but didn't get one square meal.

717
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:26,906
One Eid, I asked my father
for a new shirt

718
00:49:27,978 --> 00:49:29,502
I was flatly refused.

719
00:49:30,714 --> 00:49:32,204
I stormed out of the house
in tears.

720
00:49:34,418 --> 00:49:35,715
Eventually, I did get it.

721
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,845
I'm still paying its price.

722
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,289
Brother!

723
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:13,647
Hey, we're watching another
Bollywood today.

724
00:50:17,027 --> 00:50:18,016
Brother.

725
00:50:19,463 --> 00:50:20,259
Jawaad.

726
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:33,238
"In tangles...
at last, these knots open"

727
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:36,977
"Why is the wind so ticklish today?"

728
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:42,280
"It's a mystery... just like
this laughter"

729
00:50:43,087 --> 00:50:48,650
"The unspoken understanding
of our friendship"

730
00:50:48,926 --> 00:50:53,659
"Let's embrace life... it is time"

731
00:50:53,897 --> 00:50:59,529
"Heart's are pure,
like earthen pots of love..."

732
00:50:59,803 --> 00:51:05,105
"...with two wings, no less"

733
00:51:08,178 --> 00:51:13,980
"Ask the heart,"can I sway"?"

734
00:51:14,351 --> 00:51:17,809
"I tell it, "fly away... fly away"

735
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:22,957
"In tangles...
at last, these knots open"

736
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:26,492
"Why is the wind so ticklish today?"

737
00:51:26,830 --> 00:51:31,324
"It's a mystery... just like
this laughter"

738
00:51:31,435 --> 00:51:33,903
I've a car, bungalow
fat bank balance.

739
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:36,299
What do you have?
- I've mother.

740
00:51:36,573 --> 00:51:38,973
Bugger off. Liar! You have dad!

741
00:51:39,243 --> 00:51:40,972
True.

742
00:51:41,979 --> 00:51:43,810
I wouldn't be sewing my buttons
if mom was alive.

743
00:51:44,982 --> 00:51:46,506
I miss her so much.

744
00:51:47,317 --> 00:51:49,308
Even I miss my mom, brother.

745
00:51:51,255 --> 00:51:53,155
Can't you help me...

746
00:51:54,124 --> 00:51:55,591
...help me get back home,
brother?

747
00:51:55,926 --> 00:52:00,954
Look buddy, I will help you live,
not help you die.

748
00:52:02,966 --> 00:52:05,127
Your daft ideas will help us
both get killed.

749
00:52:05,469 --> 00:52:07,334
"Help me reach home." Huh!

750
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:08,797
Aftab.

751
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:12,891
Brother.

752
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:14,795
My gun is missing!

753
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,329
Where is the hostage?

754
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:27,814
Brother!

755
00:53:30,621 --> 00:53:33,317
Not from here...
there are kids around.

756
00:53:58,115 --> 00:53:59,047
Okay, tell me.

757
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:00,680
How does actor Mithun fire a gun?

758
00:54:01,385 --> 00:54:03,114
Who can tell me?
Let me show you...

759
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:06,384
Mithun doesn't need a gun.

760
00:54:06,557 --> 00:54:11,153
He just goes,
Take this... and that..."

761
00:54:11,328 --> 00:54:14,855
Take that.
And that.

762
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:23,904
And when superstar
Shatrughan fires...

763
00:54:24,141 --> 00:54:25,733
...the chap next to him pops it.

764
00:54:31,415 --> 00:54:32,746
Quiet!

765
00:54:41,425 --> 00:54:46,226
But who has perfect aim?
Never misses!

766
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:48,357
Who can tell me?

767
00:54:48,732 --> 00:54:50,393
Salman Khan. - Nope!
- Akshay Kumar.

768
00:54:50,634 --> 00:54:52,192
It's not Akshay Kumar.

769
00:54:52,603 --> 00:54:53,968
It's Ashok Kumar.

770
00:54:54,237 --> 00:54:55,727
Because he fires this way.

771
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:41,610
Physician, sir... here it is.

772
00:55:42,985 --> 00:55:44,680
So, are you better now?

773
00:55:44,954 --> 00:55:47,787
By the grace of Allah.
The bullet just grazed him.

774
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:50,218
The wound isn't too deep.

775
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,052
It will heal soon.

776
00:55:52,428 --> 00:55:54,020
You shouldn't have
picked up the gun.

777
00:55:54,463 --> 00:55:56,795
I was just fooling around
with the kids.

778
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:00,100
Fooling around? Superstar
Dev Anand shoots like this.

779
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:01,802
Ashok Kumar shoots like this.

780
00:56:01,871 --> 00:56:03,270
Mithun fires like this.

781
00:56:03,439 --> 00:56:05,669
Now you know how
Brother Mehmood shoots?

782
00:56:06,642 --> 00:56:08,667
By the way,
he never misses his target.

783
00:56:09,345 --> 00:56:11,540
It might be wise for you
to not play with guns.

784
00:56:11,914 --> 00:56:13,142
You should thank God...

785
00:56:13,215 --> 00:56:14,944
...that the physician sir
was in the village.

786
00:56:15,685 --> 00:56:19,212
Sir, if you need anything else,
please let me know.

787
00:56:20,423 --> 00:56:22,050
Now get some rest.

788
00:56:28,964 --> 00:56:30,898
Thank you very much, uncle.

789
00:56:31,167 --> 00:56:32,794
You speak Punjabi?

790
00:56:32,868 --> 00:56:35,496
Sir, please meet myself,
Sunny Arora from the Delhi.

791
00:56:35,705 --> 00:56:37,002
I've traveled a lot

792
00:56:37,173 --> 00:56:38,140
Punjab.

793
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,935
Delhi. Amritsar.

794
00:56:40,042 --> 00:56:41,236
Encore!

795
00:56:41,544 --> 00:56:42,909
Once again, meet myself.

796
00:56:42,978 --> 00:56:44,741
Sunny, a.k. A, Sukhwinder Arora.

797
00:56:44,847 --> 00:56:46,144
Originally from Amritsar.

798
00:56:46,315 --> 00:56:47,942
Do you know Gurudas Square...

799
00:56:48,384 --> 00:56:49,874
...does it still exist?

800
00:56:50,353 --> 00:56:51,479
Of course, it does.

801
00:56:51,821 --> 00:56:54,187
My father's hosiery shop is
right there.

802
00:56:54,557 --> 00:56:56,457
I go there every day.

803
00:56:57,026 --> 00:56:58,755
How do you know it?

804
00:56:59,495 --> 00:57:03,022
Memories of Amritsar
are still alive in my heart.

805
00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:06,066
It feels like,
I came from there just yesterday.

806
00:57:07,169 --> 00:57:09,637
The neighborhood of Pathanpura...

807
00:57:09,872 --> 00:57:11,237
...that's where I used to live.

808
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:12,938
Pathanpura?

809
00:57:15,678 --> 00:57:16,975
Never heard of it.

810
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:19,309
If entire nations can be razed...

811
00:57:20,850 --> 00:57:23,410
...what hope does a little
colony stand, son!

812
00:57:24,186 --> 00:57:25,778
Do you miss that place?

813
00:57:26,255 --> 00:57:28,189
I miss it a lot, son.

814
00:57:28,858 --> 00:57:31,986
That's why, whenever
Aftab brings an Indian film...

815
00:57:32,628 --> 00:57:34,653
...I come running to watch it.

816
00:57:35,064 --> 00:57:37,760
Those films are my way of
crossing over.

817
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,393
That way I meet old friends.

818
00:57:40,836 --> 00:57:42,827
Take a walk on my old streets.

819
00:57:43,539 --> 00:57:46,167
Feel the plants and trees
from there.

820
00:57:46,776 --> 00:57:48,107
It makes my day.

821
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:51,077
You speak just like my grandpa.

822
00:57:52,448 --> 00:57:54,473
He used to always talk about Lahore,

823
00:57:55,384 --> 00:57:57,181
"Anyone who hasn't seen Lahore...

824
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,846
...hasn't truly been born yet!

825
00:57:59,855 --> 00:58:02,380
Grandpa lived in Lahore
before the partition.

826
00:58:03,526 --> 00:58:05,687
Till his last breath he hoped...

827
00:58:06,629 --> 00:58:08,290
...that he'll visit Lahore again.

828
00:58:09,365 --> 00:58:12,698
Sir, you remind me of my grandpa!

829
00:58:13,035 --> 00:58:15,868
Memories are all that
we're left with now, son.

830
00:58:16,205 --> 00:58:18,230
Anyway...

831
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:20,501
...take these medicines.

832
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:22,771
Take them on time.

833
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:25,243
It will lower the intensity
of your pain.

834
00:58:25,948 --> 00:58:28,678
Sir, can't you leave a few vials
of your conversations for me?

835
00:58:29,185 --> 00:58:32,154
Half my pain's gone
just talking to you!

836
00:58:33,055 --> 00:58:35,717
Bless you, son.
May Allah be with you!

837
00:58:35,891 --> 00:58:38,359
"Memories won't do anymore."

838
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:42,056
"Embrace me and speak"

839
00:58:42,164 --> 00:58:47,067
"Boundaries and borders are
confines on paper"

840
00:58:47,136 --> 00:58:50,833
"Be free and speak"

841
00:59:01,684 --> 00:59:06,519
"Walls and maps are only
in the mind"

842
00:59:06,589 --> 00:59:10,582
"Be mindless and speak"

843
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:16,154
"Words carry caution"

844
00:59:16,232 --> 00:59:19,963
"Let the eyes speak"

845
00:59:20,035 --> 00:59:28,773
"Borders have wasted us away"

846
00:59:30,679 --> 00:59:39,417
"Trust no more,
the promises of the moon"

847
00:59:40,289 --> 00:59:45,955
"Faith is an obsession...
tire of it!"

848
00:59:46,395 --> 00:59:49,455
"Tire of it"

849
00:59:50,032 --> 00:59:57,495
"This intoxication
is devastation... Run away"

850
00:59:59,742 --> 01:00:02,370
Wow! What a shot, man!

851
01:00:02,478 --> 01:00:04,207
Just like Sachin Tendulkar.

852
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:07,607
Wasn't that shot like Sachin's?

853
01:00:07,917 --> 01:00:08,975
Afridi.

854
01:00:09,051 --> 01:00:11,076
You take everything personally.

855
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:13,018
But he did hit the shot like Sachin.

856
01:00:13,188 --> 01:00:14,314
Ask anyone?

857
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:15,514
Afridi.

858
01:00:15,758 --> 01:00:16,816
Fine.

859
01:00:16,959 --> 01:00:18,221
He hit it like Afridi.

860
01:00:18,494 --> 01:00:21,156
But you will admit that Sachin
Tendulkar is the best batsman.

861
01:00:21,497 --> 01:00:22,987
Afridi's the best batsman.

862
01:00:23,065 --> 01:00:23,793
Best!

863
01:00:23,899 --> 01:00:26,094
...lsn't that a bit much?
I mean...

864
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:27,830
Whatever.

865
01:00:28,837 --> 01:00:30,031
Now you'll even say...

866
01:00:30,105 --> 01:00:32,164
...that Pakistan is the
best cricket team!

867
01:00:33,909 --> 01:00:34,876
Undoubtedly!

868
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:36,503
Is it?

869
01:00:36,579 --> 01:00:38,274
Then who has the World Cup?

870
01:00:38,681 --> 01:00:39,807
Go ahead, say it.

871
01:00:40,049 --> 01:00:41,607
Why are you quiet now?

872
01:00:42,484 --> 01:00:44,111
Even Pakistan has won
the world cup.

873
01:00:44,653 --> 01:00:47,019
And India's won it twice!

874
01:00:49,758 --> 01:00:52,226
That way,
Australia has won it four times.

875
01:00:52,728 --> 01:00:55,629
But India is still better than
Pakistan, admit it!

876
01:00:56,532 --> 01:00:57,590
Look.

877
01:00:58,801 --> 01:01:00,462
Both the countries are
in the finals right now.

878
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,633
We'll know who is better.

879
01:01:03,806 --> 01:01:05,273
Awesome, I knew it!

880
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:08,635
I'm sure that India will win
the finals.

881
01:01:10,179 --> 01:01:11,077
Pakistan.

882
01:01:11,146 --> 01:01:12,044
Wanna bet?

883
01:01:12,648 --> 01:01:13,979
If Pakistan wins...

884
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:16,611
...I am right here.
You can shoot me again.

885
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:18,286
Okay?

886
01:01:18,754 --> 01:01:20,346
And if India wins...

887
01:01:20,756 --> 01:01:22,747
...then you will let me go home.

888
01:01:23,692 --> 01:01:25,319
Deal?

889
01:01:26,762 --> 01:01:28,024
What happened?

890
01:01:28,197 --> 01:01:30,563
Don't you have faith in your team?

891
01:01:31,233 --> 01:01:32,530
Is it a deal?

892
01:01:40,075 --> 01:01:43,169
Mom! Keep my favourite
pudding ready.

893
01:01:43,278 --> 01:01:44,905
I'll be home soon!

894
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,380
Hurrah! Ouch!

895
01:01:48,517 --> 01:01:52,476
Pakistan will win!

896
01:01:54,156 --> 01:01:55,646
Are they giving free food?

897
01:01:56,058 --> 01:01:58,583
The India-Pakistan
cricket match is on.

898
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:04,861
What's the score?

899
01:02:05,067 --> 01:02:06,125
Let's find out.

900
01:02:06,368 --> 01:02:09,929
"After this over the score is
261 for 6."

901
01:02:10,172 --> 01:02:12,140
"It's the last over of match..."
- Please come.

902
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:13,573
The situation is intense.

903
01:02:13,742 --> 01:02:14,970
12 runs required in 6 balls.

904
01:02:15,177 --> 01:02:16,940
Hey, increase the volume.

905
01:02:17,046 --> 01:02:20,880
"The final match of the Asia Cup
just got incredibly interesting."

906
01:02:21,083 --> 01:02:23,415
"Pakistani bowlers are constantly
maintaining pressure."

907
01:02:23,619 --> 01:02:25,109
"At this delicate juncture...

908
01:02:25,187 --> 01:02:28,782
...the onus of bowling lies on the
sturdy shoulders of Mohammad Amir."

909
01:02:29,591 --> 01:02:32,992
"He advances towards the
Indian batsmen Harbhajan."

910
01:02:33,062 --> 01:02:33,994
"Good length bowling...

911
01:02:34,063 --> 01:02:36,759
...but it gets smashed and that's
six runs for India!"

912
01:02:37,032 --> 01:02:38,863
Damn you! You gave them six?

913
01:02:38,934 --> 01:02:41,528
"And things just got more intense."

914
01:02:41,904 --> 01:02:44,065
"India needs just six runs
off five balls."

915
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:46,100
"Not a tough target."

916
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:47,502
"Harbhajan is on strike."

917
01:02:47,743 --> 01:02:50,837
"But the bowler and batsmen
are choosing to duel verbally."

918
01:02:50,913 --> 01:02:52,073
Quit scrapping, and play already!

919
01:02:52,147 --> 01:02:55,583
"The player's heads and
the weather just got hotter."

920
01:02:56,151 --> 01:02:58,949
"Harbhajan has struck the ball
Raina, running for a single."

921
01:02:59,021 --> 01:03:00,750
"And it's a direct hit."

922
01:03:00,923 --> 01:03:02,686
"Pakistan team is very confident."

923
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:04,415
"A wonderful throw
from the fielder."

924
01:03:04,593 --> 01:03:08,962
"Everyone waits for the
Third Umpire's decision."

925
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:10,430
Let him be out, O' Lord.

926
01:03:10,532 --> 01:03:13,092
I swear I'll read the holy book
like its going out of style

927
01:03:13,635 --> 01:03:15,660
"And he's out!"

928
01:03:15,738 --> 01:03:18,434
"The Pakistani's rejoice."

929
01:03:19,241 --> 01:03:21,334
"Indians have to make
six runs off four balls now."

930
01:03:21,443 --> 01:03:24,776
"The new batsmen is on
strike now... he hits."

931
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,211
"The Pakistani fielder is too far."

932
01:03:26,315 --> 01:03:28,749
"And India adds 2 runs
to their score."

933
01:03:28,817 --> 01:03:32,344
"Disappointment is rife on
captain Afridi's face."

934
01:03:32,554 --> 01:03:35,921
"Four runs off three balls
makes the situation very tense."

935
01:03:35,991 --> 01:03:39,427
"It can still be anyone's game."

936
01:03:39,495 --> 01:03:43,659
"The batsmen swings, and
Pakistan displays superb fielding...

937
01:03:43,899 --> 01:03:46,390
...giving India a single run
instead of four."

938
01:03:46,568 --> 01:03:48,035
"But danger still looms for Pakistan."

939
01:03:48,103 --> 01:03:50,094
"Only three runs needed...

940
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:51,566
...and Harbhajan is on strike."

941
01:03:51,673 --> 01:03:54,073
"Afridi whispers a few
words to the bowler."

942
01:03:54,243 --> 01:03:56,768
"All eyes are on the ball...

943
01:03:57,045 --> 01:03:59,980
"Harbhajan swings on leg-side...

944
01:04:00,082 --> 01:04:02,710
...it's in the air again... Shoaib
Akhtar is running towards it..."

945
01:04:02,785 --> 01:04:04,412
"And it's a 6!"

946
01:04:05,487 --> 01:04:07,512
India! India!

947
01:04:08,223 --> 01:04:10,157
India! India!

948
01:04:10,926 --> 01:04:13,019
India! India!

949
01:04:13,796 --> 01:04:15,696
India! India!

950
01:04:16,498 --> 01:04:17,829
India!

951
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:20,524
Wow! Hurrah!

952
01:04:20,702 --> 01:04:21,896
Mr. Colonel Singh!

953
01:04:22,104 --> 01:04:25,699
Lord General Singh!
In your face, Grumps!

954
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,269
Brother!

955
01:04:33,348 --> 01:04:34,372
Brother!

956
01:04:35,083 --> 01:04:36,744
What are you doing, Brother?
- Move!

957
01:04:37,586 --> 01:04:41,522
Brother... not the camera!
Not the camera!

958
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:42,284
Let go of my hand.

959
01:04:42,357 --> 01:04:44,120
I said leave my hand.
- Not the camera, Brother!

960
01:04:45,294 --> 01:04:47,262
Don't vent the your anger
on the camera...

961
01:04:47,930 --> 01:04:49,227
Leave my hand.

962
01:04:52,034 --> 01:04:53,126
Leave my hand.

963
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,076
Let go.

964
01:05:06,215 --> 01:05:07,477
Leave my hand.

965
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,111
You'll kill him.
Let him go.

966
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:16,382
Brother, he's just a naive child,

967
01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:19,259
Let him go.
- Have mercy.

968
01:05:20,863 --> 01:05:23,457
Brother!
Forgive him.

969
01:05:24,733 --> 01:05:28,794
"We are not complete"

970
01:05:28,971 --> 01:05:36,070
"But not without reason
We are homeless... rootless"

971
01:05:36,745 --> 01:05:41,011
"But today I wish to be complete"

972
01:05:41,116 --> 01:05:45,177
"Before my loving and free smile"

973
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:53,217
"Frowns and flees... forever!"
- The whole village is watching.

974
01:05:53,295 --> 01:05:57,288
"Your God and His messengers...
O' Earth!"

975
01:05:57,399 --> 01:06:02,234
"Roams so restlessly,
O' Earth!"

976
01:06:02,504 --> 01:06:04,028
I swear on all that's holy...

977
01:06:05,173 --> 01:06:07,107
...you will not leave this place alive.

978
01:06:09,111 --> 01:06:13,013
"Your God and His messengers...
O' Earth!"

979
01:06:13,115 --> 01:06:16,983
"Roams so restlessly,
O' Earth!"

980
01:06:17,085 --> 01:06:20,987
"With such manic glee...
O' Earth!"

981
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:24,855
"Soaked in blood...
O' Earth!"

982
01:06:32,768 --> 01:06:34,531
Packing, huh?

983
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:38,467
So brother Mehmood
is dropping you home!

984
01:06:39,508 --> 01:06:40,907
Here, drink this turmeric milk

985
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,834
It will mute the pain.

986
01:06:46,315 --> 01:06:47,907
Have you become serious?

987
01:06:48,817 --> 01:06:50,307
Or are you in that much pain?

988
01:06:51,486 --> 01:06:52,919
Men don't feel pain!"

989
01:06:56,058 --> 01:06:57,423
He's got one heck of a heavy hand.

990
01:06:58,026 --> 01:06:59,152
Had not we stopped...

991
01:06:59,728 --> 01:07:02,424
I swear, his slaps can kill someone.

992
01:07:03,031 --> 01:07:04,293
Here drink this.

993
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:08,798
And finish your packing...

994
01:07:10,238 --> 01:07:11,330
...if you want to go home.

995
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:15,702
You'll go home.

996
01:07:16,678 --> 01:07:17,940
I'll take you there.

997
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:21,681
Whatever!

998
01:07:26,555 --> 01:07:27,453
Truly?"

999
01:07:27,823 --> 01:07:28,847
"Madly, deeply

1000
01:07:29,157 --> 01:07:30,215
But how?

1001
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:47,698
What are they doing here?

1002
01:07:55,984 --> 01:07:57,417
Brother Mehmood!

1003
01:07:57,819 --> 01:07:59,252
Brother Mehmood!

1004
01:08:02,691 --> 01:08:04,989
What are they doing here?
Who called them here?

1005
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:06,851
You think you're so bloody smart!

1006
01:08:06,962 --> 01:08:08,293
Are we fools to inform them?

1007
01:08:08,363 --> 01:08:09,227
Then how did they come here?

1008
01:08:09,364 --> 01:08:11,992
This is border area.
Patrolling here is very common.

1009
01:08:12,334 --> 01:08:13,631
Don't worry, they'll just
look around and leave.

1010
01:08:15,737 --> 01:08:17,204
So they do patrolling at
your house too?

1011
01:08:17,372 --> 01:08:18,634
Jawaad, guard the door.

1012
01:08:18,807 --> 01:08:20,138
I'll watch these scoundrels
from above.

1013
01:08:20,275 --> 01:08:22,937
Brother! You're getting
unnecessarily worried.

1014
01:08:23,311 --> 01:08:24,778
They have guns too...

1015
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:26,472
...and there are women and
children in the village.

1016
01:08:26,715 --> 01:08:28,307
I don't want any bloodshed here.

1017
01:08:28,817 --> 01:08:31,911
Please stay put, I'll handle them.

1018
01:08:36,925 --> 01:08:38,153
Have you gone mad?

1019
01:08:38,593 --> 01:08:39,992
At least you're alive here.

1020
01:08:40,328 --> 01:08:44,992
If you're caught you'll either die a
spy's death or rot in their prison.

1021
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:54,975
Anybody inside?

1022
01:09:00,382 --> 01:09:01,815
Is anyone here?

1023
01:09:02,584 --> 01:09:05,519
Hello, sir... hello...

1024
01:09:05,587 --> 01:09:07,384
Why are you standing?
Please be seated.

1025
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:09,653
Let it be.
Its quite hot outside.

1026
01:09:09,991 --> 01:09:11,151
We'll sit inside.

1027
01:09:24,072 --> 01:09:26,632
I was coming to see you myself...

1028
01:09:27,375 --> 01:09:29,570
...but got busy with things.

1029
01:09:30,345 --> 01:09:32,472
I apologize that you had to
take the trouble.

1030
01:09:32,547 --> 01:09:35,015
It's ok. It's my duty.

1031
01:09:35,383 --> 01:09:36,714
Also now we have seen your house.

1032
01:09:36,785 --> 01:09:37,513
It's your home, sir.

1033
01:09:37,586 --> 01:09:39,747
Just get the stuff.
- Right away.

1034
01:09:45,927 --> 01:09:47,690
Cool buttermilk?

1035
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:49,597
Thank you.

1036
01:09:59,841 --> 01:10:00,671
Here you go.

1037
01:10:01,576 --> 01:10:02,634
Two are English CDs...

1038
01:10:02,911 --> 01:10:04,902
...and one is French.
It's the best.

1039
01:10:05,113 --> 01:10:06,171
Hold this.

1040
01:10:11,686 --> 01:10:13,153
Brother Sunny! Brother Sunny!

1041
01:10:15,056 --> 01:10:16,387
Brother Sunny!

1042
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:18,581
Come here.

1043
01:10:25,233 --> 01:10:26,029
Who is Sunny?

1044
01:10:26,268 --> 01:10:27,826
Sunny Deol, the actor!

1045
01:10:28,336 --> 01:10:30,236
He's a huge fan of
Sunny Deol's films.

1046
01:10:30,672 --> 01:10:33,106
I've got his entire collection,
fool!

1047
01:10:34,643 --> 01:10:36,235
He's my brother.
Did you greet them?

1048
01:10:36,545 --> 01:10:37,534
Greetings, sir.

1049
01:10:38,113 --> 01:10:38,807
Hello.

1050
01:10:39,548 --> 01:10:41,482
Now get lost.

1051
01:10:43,518 --> 01:10:45,918
The little rat loves Sunny Deol...

1052
01:10:46,154 --> 01:10:47,849
...as much as you love
Sunny Leone!

1053
01:10:48,323 --> 01:10:49,813
We must leave now.
- Ok.

1054
01:10:54,396 --> 01:10:57,263
Cool jacket!

1055
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:59,997
Where did you steal it from?

1056
01:11:00,168 --> 01:11:05,128
Oh! I bought this from
Karachi last week.

1057
01:11:05,473 --> 01:11:06,906
Next time, buy one for me.

1058
01:11:07,108 --> 01:11:09,167
Of course. I'll buy two.

1059
01:11:10,679 --> 01:11:12,874
God be with you!
- And you, sir.

1060
01:11:14,783 --> 01:11:16,114
God be with you!

1061
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:19,619
Goodbye.

1062
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:29,288
Come out.
They've left.

1063
01:11:30,031 --> 01:11:31,259
Come out.

1064
01:11:38,406 --> 01:11:40,135
Like I said, it's routine
patrolling.

1065
01:11:41,543 --> 01:11:42,510
Thanks, brother.

1066
01:11:42,911 --> 01:11:44,640
We were doubting you for no reason.

1067
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:48,739
Doubt takes a moment
to turn into trust, brother.

1068
01:11:49,551 --> 01:11:53,043
Today you doubt, tomorrow,
God willing, you will trust me!

1069
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:02,056
Desi Boys.
Seasons.

1070
01:12:02,497 --> 01:12:03,486
Seven Murders.

1071
01:12:04,299 --> 01:12:05,960
Even their film titles
are awesome!

1072
01:12:06,101 --> 01:12:09,298
Yamla Pagla.
Thank you.

1073
01:12:09,604 --> 01:12:10,730
Tea.

1074
01:12:11,473 --> 01:12:12,906
Desi Boys.

1075
01:12:15,677 --> 01:12:17,838
Don't you guys watch films?

1076
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:20,107
Or are not interested in films?

1077
01:12:20,915 --> 01:12:22,883
These worthless things
are forbidden for us.

1078
01:12:23,985 --> 01:12:25,885
Alas!
What's forbidden is pleasurable...

1079
01:12:26,421 --> 01:12:27,820
...and people do them.

1080
01:12:28,623 --> 01:12:30,921
And I make money off it.

1081
01:12:33,628 --> 01:12:36,426
You're polluting our society
by showing these Indian films.

1082
01:12:36,698 --> 01:12:39,030
You think our cinema is pure?

1083
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:43,693
My hair's wet and blouse wetter,
boys tell me to come hither...

1084
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:46,638
You think lads are going
to read the rosary with her?

1085
01:12:47,776 --> 01:12:48,538
That's why...

1086
01:12:49,044 --> 01:12:51,512
...I want our Lollywood to
make clean films too.

1087
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,613
One's which Bollywood will
copy and pirate.

1088
01:12:57,052 --> 01:12:58,781
Sometimes I feel like
picking up the camera...

1089
01:12:59,387 --> 01:13:00,445
...and making a film.

1090
01:13:00,955 --> 01:13:02,923
I know the people's pulse,
you see.

1091
01:13:05,226 --> 01:13:06,056
Brother.

1092
01:13:07,529 --> 01:13:08,860
May I ask you something?

1093
01:13:10,465 --> 01:13:13,127
See, we know this guy's
not going to live.

1094
01:13:13,835 --> 01:13:16,326
And you two will continue
on the good Lord's path...

1095
01:13:17,772 --> 01:13:18,864
Spit it out, boy!

1096
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:26,139
Thing is, this camera will be
of no use to him or you

1097
01:13:27,248 --> 01:13:28,772
If you give it to me...

1098
01:13:29,150 --> 01:13:31,175
...it'll help our entire community.

1099
01:13:31,886 --> 01:13:33,183
Take it, brother.

1100
01:13:33,521 --> 01:13:35,318
We won't object.
- Really?

1101
01:13:36,725 --> 01:13:38,215
You're not kidding?

1102
01:13:38,993 --> 01:13:40,051
Can I take it?

1103
01:13:44,032 --> 01:13:44,999
Thank you so much, Brother.

1104
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:46,531
By giving me this camera...

1105
01:13:46,835 --> 01:13:48,803
...you've done entire
Pakistan a huge favor.

1106
01:13:49,137 --> 01:13:50,798
Allah will reward you for this.

1107
01:13:51,039 --> 01:13:52,404
Thanks.

1108
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,913
It's very heavy.

1109
01:14:01,182 --> 01:14:03,013
What are you doing?
That's my camera?

1110
01:14:03,118 --> 01:14:04,107
Shut up.

1111
01:14:04,586 --> 01:14:06,110
A million slaps later
he's still dumb.

1112
01:14:06,921 --> 01:14:09,151
Chill, I'm just checking
if it still works.

1113
01:14:11,259 --> 01:14:12,521
What do you place this on?

1114
01:14:15,096 --> 01:14:16,154
I am asking you?

1115
01:14:18,066 --> 01:14:19,863
Why don't you answer?
Have you gone deaf?

1116
01:14:20,335 --> 01:14:21,700
Why don't you do as he says?

1117
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:27,873
So you place it on this?
Show me.

1118
01:14:29,878 --> 01:14:31,641
Place it.

1119
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:35,514
Show me.

1120
01:14:38,953 --> 01:14:40,215
Teach me, man.

1121
01:14:42,056 --> 01:14:43,250
So this is the cassette.

1122
01:14:44,225 --> 01:14:45,317
Wow.

1123
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:47,360
It's fastened.

1124
01:14:50,698 --> 01:14:51,995
I can't see a thing.

1125
01:14:53,234 --> 01:14:54,428
Where do you see from?

1126
01:14:54,903 --> 01:14:56,336
Answer him!

1127
01:15:01,376 --> 01:15:02,468
Oh, I was holding it the wrong way.

1128
01:15:03,178 --> 01:15:04,145
Yes, here.

1129
01:15:05,146 --> 01:15:06,738
I can't see a thing.
It's broken.

1130
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:11,180
I can see, I can see.
Brother Mehmood.

1131
01:15:11,586 --> 01:15:12,712
I can see you.

1132
01:15:13,321 --> 01:15:14,811
You look like George Clooney!

1133
01:15:15,723 --> 01:15:16,917
This is awesome.

1134
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,749
Now it's all set.

1135
01:15:22,363 --> 01:15:24,524
Brother.
Get ready to run away.

1136
01:15:24,833 --> 01:15:26,357
One runs away from strangers...

1137
01:15:27,268 --> 01:15:29,293
Where can we hope to run to
from our loved ones?

1138
01:15:30,672 --> 01:15:31,696
Father was right.

1139
01:15:32,674 --> 01:15:34,938
I'm a liar. I deceived everyone.

1140
01:15:36,044 --> 01:15:38,342
So what if I lied for your love.

1141
01:15:39,614 --> 01:15:41,104
A lie is a lie...

1142
01:15:42,083 --> 01:15:43,448
Father is right.

1143
01:15:43,751 --> 01:15:45,548
I am not worthy of you.
- Cut!

1144
01:15:47,155 --> 01:15:48,247
See that?

1145
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:50,351
Everyone has to perform
like that.

1146
01:15:50,725 --> 01:15:51,953
Here are your lines...

1147
01:15:52,026 --> 01:15:53,960
...memorize them word to word.

1148
01:15:54,329 --> 01:15:56,126
Get ready and stand before
the camera.

1149
01:15:56,698 --> 01:16:00,327
Here... Memorize them properly.

1150
01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:07,665
You can run from strangers.

1151
01:16:08,042 --> 01:16:09,304
But what good would
that have done?

1152
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:10,468
So what...

1153
01:16:10,678 --> 01:16:12,839
...if I lied for your love.

1154
01:16:13,114 --> 01:16:15,014
Father... is right.

1155
01:16:15,116 --> 01:16:16,913
I am a liar.
A deceiver.

1156
01:16:17,018 --> 01:16:18,952
Father is right.
I am not worthy of you.

1157
01:16:19,087 --> 01:16:20,554
A lie is a lie after all.

1158
01:16:20,655 --> 01:16:24,147
So what?
If I love you like crazy.

1159
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:27,992
So what if I love you hopelessly.

1160
01:16:28,162 --> 01:16:30,255
Love is not everything.

1161
01:16:30,565 --> 01:16:33,432
Father is right, Simran.
Father's right.

1162
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:37,569
Forgive... forgive me...
I don't want to say, I can't.

1163
01:16:37,839 --> 01:16:40,706
Father, forgive me
just this once.

1164
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:42,704
Forgive me, father.

1165
01:16:45,446 --> 01:16:47,937
What are the lines?
- I don't have any line.

1166
01:16:48,349 --> 01:16:50,078
There's no dearth of talents
in Pakistan.

1167
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:52,745
If a village has so much, imagine
the numbers in the whole country.

1168
01:16:54,122 --> 01:16:55,384
I just can't find anyone
to play the father.

1169
01:16:55,924 --> 01:16:58,916
Once I find him I will stun
everyone with my magnum opus!

1170
01:17:00,061 --> 01:17:01,221
By the way, Brother Mehmood.

1171
01:17:01,629 --> 01:17:03,290
You have an intense face.

1172
01:17:03,831 --> 01:17:05,958
Ever think of facing the camera?

1173
01:17:07,235 --> 01:17:08,133
Get lost!

1174
01:17:08,269 --> 01:17:09,827
Have you gone mad?
Saying such things to a Godly man.

1175
01:17:10,405 --> 01:17:11,565
You'll burn in hell.

1176
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:16,267
Please have your meal.

1177
01:17:16,978 --> 01:17:18,275
I've to prepare for tomorrow...

1178
01:17:18,913 --> 01:17:20,813
...and make this lazy fart write
the dialogues!

1179
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:26,382
All good?

1180
01:17:26,454 --> 01:17:29,150
Bro, we've auditioned
the entire village.

1181
01:17:29,591 --> 01:17:30,888
But what are we going to
shoot tomorrow?!

1182
01:17:31,159 --> 01:17:34,094
See, most blockbuster films
are made without a script.

1183
01:17:34,629 --> 01:17:35,687
So will ours.

1184
01:17:36,731 --> 01:17:37,789
Don't worry...

1185
01:17:38,967 --> 01:17:40,366
...the entire script is ready...

1186
01:17:41,469 --> 01:17:42,834
...in my mind.

1187
01:17:45,073 --> 01:17:46,062
So, it's a night scene.

1188
01:17:46,674 --> 01:17:49,802
Stars are shining, dogs are barking
Razia's lying in the courtyard.

1189
01:17:50,378 --> 01:17:52,175
You'll come here and say
"Razia, I'm here".

1190
01:17:52,680 --> 01:17:54,648
Get it? Now show me.

1191
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:55,506
Action!

1192
01:17:55,617 --> 01:17:56,675
Razia, I am here.

1193
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:57,945
For her funeral?

1194
01:17:58,519 --> 01:18:00,510
She's your beloved.
Say it sweetly.

1195
01:18:00,855 --> 01:18:02,914
Shower her with love.
Drown her in it.

1196
01:18:03,358 --> 01:18:04,757
Again.
Action!

1197
01:18:05,293 --> 01:18:07,523
Razia, I am here!

1198
01:18:07,962 --> 01:18:09,224
Did a truck run over you
on the way?

1199
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:12,095
Say it lovingly.
Action.

1200
01:18:12,834 --> 01:18:14,461
Razia, I am here!

1201
01:18:14,902 --> 01:18:16,836
Razia, bolt the doors,
dacoits are here.

1202
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:19,167
Listen.

1203
01:18:19,707 --> 01:18:21,607
This is not your cup of tea.
We'll do this later.

1204
01:18:22,143 --> 01:18:23,110
Understand the scene.

1205
01:18:23,411 --> 01:18:25,606
Your girlfriend's father
is against your love.

1206
01:18:26,147 --> 01:18:27,409
So what will a real Pathan do?

1207
01:18:27,949 --> 01:18:29,416
Elope with her.

1208
01:18:29,917 --> 01:18:30,747
How will you do it?

1209
01:18:30,985 --> 01:18:32,213
Razia. Come here.

1210
01:18:35,890 --> 01:18:38,586
This is Razia.
You've to elope with her. Okay?

1211
01:18:39,394 --> 01:18:41,954
Wow! Kindly cover your
blooming youth.

1212
01:18:42,497 --> 01:18:44,488
Okay. Hold her hand
and run, I will say, start.

1213
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:47,229
Now turn that way.
Action!

1214
01:18:48,236 --> 01:18:49,567
Stop, you flapping scavenger!

1215
01:18:49,771 --> 01:18:51,636
You're running like
the Devil's widow!

1216
01:18:52,206 --> 01:18:54,766
And Razia, did you steal a
loaf of bread? Come here.

1217
01:19:00,848 --> 01:19:02,907
Come here.
Look how we'll run.

1218
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:05,013
He's Razia.

1219
01:19:05,319 --> 01:19:08,015
And I am Razaq.
Come here. Stand here.

1220
01:19:08,322 --> 01:19:09,516
I will hold his hands and run...

1221
01:19:09,791 --> 01:19:12,351
I will hold his hand and run...
just watch and learn.

1222
01:19:13,027 --> 01:19:14,051
Action!

1223
01:19:53,801 --> 01:19:55,428
So have you understood how to run?

1224
01:19:56,170 --> 01:19:57,159
Got it?

1225
01:19:57,505 --> 01:19:58,437
Good.

1226
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,011
Don't worry.

1227
01:20:07,248 --> 01:20:09,011
Once you memorize the lines...

1228
01:20:09,217 --> 01:20:11,208
...l'll handle the acting.

1229
01:20:11,452 --> 01:20:15,149
Trust me, after Romeo and Juliet
it will be Razia and Razaq.

1230
01:20:15,656 --> 01:20:17,385
And after I add two cabaret songs...

1231
01:20:17,759 --> 01:20:19,283
...people will break the seats
in the theaters.

1232
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,692
The audience will tear the curtains.

1233
01:20:21,963 --> 01:20:24,397
Everybody did a great job today.

1234
01:20:24,665 --> 01:20:26,098
Come.
Keep the boxes here.

1235
01:20:26,501 --> 01:20:27,661
Keep this here.

1236
01:20:28,069 --> 01:20:29,969
Come on. Everyone, sit.

1237
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:32,729
Father, can we have some tea?
- Of course.

1238
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:35,637
Here, Have some piping hot tea.

1239
01:20:36,944 --> 01:20:38,844
We did such good work today,
words fail me.

1240
01:20:39,781 --> 01:20:42,045
Razia's lover
is the next Shahrukh Khan.

1241
01:20:42,784 --> 01:20:44,115
Such a talented boy.

1242
01:20:44,852 --> 01:20:47,480
If it wasn't for you then his
talent would've gone unnoticed.

1243
01:20:48,389 --> 01:20:49,856
You did a noble deed.

1244
01:20:50,358 --> 01:20:51,586
The boy's listening to you,
isn't he?

1245
01:20:51,893 --> 01:20:53,087
Like a lamb!

1246
01:20:53,728 --> 01:20:55,355
We just need some lights
from the city.

1247
01:20:55,830 --> 01:20:56,956
I'll get them this evening.

1248
01:20:57,298 --> 01:20:58,356
Brother Aftab,
we'll take your leave.

1249
01:20:58,566 --> 01:20:59,328
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1250
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:01,327
Be on time tomorrow.
- Okay.

1251
01:21:01,936 --> 01:21:02,960
Everyone's really happy.

1252
01:21:04,205 --> 01:21:05,672
God be with you!
- And you!

1253
01:21:06,174 --> 01:21:07,198
Hold on, lady!

1254
01:21:25,693 --> 01:21:27,422
Does this belong to one of you?
- It's mine.

1255
01:21:28,496 --> 01:21:30,396
Take care of your belongings.

1256
01:21:33,301 --> 01:21:34,859
Goodbye

1257
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:37,435
I'll also take your leave.

1258
01:21:37,672 --> 01:21:38,832
I'll be back by evening.

1259
01:21:39,540 --> 01:21:40,404
Later.

1260
01:21:53,154 --> 01:21:54,052
Brother Jawaad.

1261
01:23:32,787 --> 01:23:35,984
Brother. Brother.
No.

1262
01:23:37,425 --> 01:23:40,861
So we were the stars of
this bastard's fictional film!

1263
01:23:42,596 --> 01:23:45,326
And we should have killed
this heathen on day one.

1264
01:23:46,267 --> 01:23:47,859
My hands are tied because of
brother or else...

1265
01:23:49,103 --> 01:23:51,196
And you, Aftab!
You...

1266
01:23:53,874 --> 01:23:56,206
I tried to help you
and...

1267
01:23:56,510 --> 01:23:58,034
...you tried to trick us.

1268
01:23:59,714 --> 01:24:01,648
I spare you this time.

1269
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:05,212
Next time I'll forget
that you're one of us.

1270
01:24:05,553 --> 01:24:06,952
Don't make that mistake, brother.

1271
01:24:07,655 --> 01:24:11,250
Spare me now and I swear
I'll help him escape again.

1272
01:24:11,859 --> 01:24:13,554
I've given him my word.
- Shut up!

1273
01:24:13,627 --> 01:24:15,822
Forgive my son, sir.
Forgive him...

1274
01:24:18,132 --> 01:24:19,394
Forgive him?

1275
01:24:20,668 --> 01:24:22,226
We'll forgive him.

1276
01:24:23,004 --> 01:24:24,801
But will Allah pardon him?

1277
01:24:26,273 --> 01:24:28,298
I want to shoot him right here.

1278
01:24:29,610 --> 01:24:33,478
Instead of helping us
he's helping this ham.

1279
01:24:35,549 --> 01:24:36,277
Traitor.

1280
01:24:37,618 --> 01:24:40,052
People like him have ruined
this nation.

1281
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:44,587
We're God's men.

1282
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:46,918
We carry out His work.

1283
01:24:48,329 --> 01:24:51,298
And intervening in God's work
is a crime.

1284
01:24:51,932 --> 01:24:52,956
It's a sin.

1285
01:24:54,001 --> 01:24:56,367
How will you face God?

1286
01:24:56,637 --> 01:24:58,070
Don't bother about me.

1287
01:24:59,273 --> 01:25:00,433
As for committing a sin...

1288
01:25:01,208 --> 01:25:02,505
He will decide that.

1289
01:25:03,811 --> 01:25:06,974
You think about yourselves. You're
the ones who have spread the filth

1290
01:25:07,415 --> 01:25:08,507
In the name of Allah...

1291
01:25:09,884 --> 01:25:11,442
...you've destroyed an
entire generation...

1292
01:25:11,519 --> 01:25:13,248
...by handing guns instead
of bread in their hands!

1293
01:25:14,655 --> 01:25:16,646
You might win countries with guns...

1294
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:18,155
...but not hearts.

1295
01:25:19,093 --> 01:25:21,391
You need to have a pure heart
to win hearts.

1296
01:25:21,762 --> 01:25:23,127
And he has that.

1297
01:25:24,131 --> 01:25:25,359
If saving him is a crime...

1298
01:25:25,966 --> 01:25:27,263
...then I will keep committing it

1299
01:25:27,935 --> 01:25:29,163
Brother. Brother.

1300
01:25:30,271 --> 01:25:31,397
Lock him up.

1301
01:25:32,673 --> 01:25:34,265
Leave him.
Spare him.

1302
01:25:34,675 --> 01:25:35,437
Father!

1303
01:25:35,943 --> 01:25:37,911
Listen, take father to that side.

1304
01:25:38,345 --> 01:25:40,074
Take father quickly.

1305
01:25:54,762 --> 01:25:56,753
Don't be upset.

1306
01:25:57,565 --> 01:25:59,032
It's futile!

1307
01:26:00,134 --> 01:26:03,535
When the buffalo raises its tail,
it doesn't sing...

1308
01:26:03,771 --> 01:26:05,398
...it shits!

1309
01:26:06,941 --> 01:26:08,101
Forgive me, brother.

1310
01:26:08,976 --> 01:26:10,568
I couldn't keep my promise.

1311
01:26:11,412 --> 01:26:13,039
I am not dead yet.

1312
01:26:15,549 --> 01:26:17,813
Grandpa used to say...

1313
01:26:18,486 --> 01:26:20,477
If everything goes as you wish,
consider it good!

1314
01:26:20,821 --> 01:26:21,845
If it doesn't...

1315
01:26:22,223 --> 01:26:24,487
...consider it His wish".

1316
01:26:25,860 --> 01:26:28,988
We'll consider this God's will.

1317
01:26:31,632 --> 01:26:33,691
Sometimes I think...

1318
01:26:34,435 --> 01:26:36,528
...that if there were no borders...

1319
01:26:37,171 --> 01:26:38,832
...and crossing over was easy,

1320
01:26:39,340 --> 01:26:42,070
...no one would have to run.

1321
01:26:42,676 --> 01:26:45,440
Physician sir could eat his
favorite kulchas in Amritsar.

1322
01:26:45,913 --> 01:26:47,244
My grandpa...

1323
01:26:47,581 --> 01:26:49,674
...could enjoy kebabs in Lahore.

1324
01:26:50,117 --> 01:26:51,812
If it wasn't for the
damn Partition...

1325
01:26:52,153 --> 01:26:54,121
...then everyone would've cut
each other's throats.

1326
01:26:54,188 --> 01:26:56,315
No. Just think...

1327
01:26:56,824 --> 01:26:59,725
Sachin, Dhoni,
Afridi, Inzamam...

1328
01:27:00,127 --> 01:27:04,086
...on the same Super Team, nobody
would've dared to face us.

1329
01:27:04,999 --> 01:27:06,523
And our daughters wouldn't
have to go anywhere...

1330
01:27:06,600 --> 01:27:08,227
...after marrying your son.

1331
01:27:09,270 --> 01:27:11,795
Mehedi Hassan,
Ghulam Ali...

1332
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:14,238
...Wadali Brothers, Abida Parveen
Nusrat Sahab...

1333
01:27:15,509 --> 01:27:17,500
...our legends are from the
same soil.

1334
01:27:18,179 --> 01:27:20,807
Don't you dream a lot?

1335
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:25,216
I'm alive because of them

1336
01:27:26,187 --> 01:27:28,747
I'm obsessed with one thing.

1337
01:27:30,524 --> 01:27:31,252
Acting.

1338
01:27:32,893 --> 01:27:34,485
I've given thousands
of auditions.

1339
01:27:35,663 --> 01:27:37,130
But never got selected.

1340
01:27:39,333 --> 01:27:41,233
There's something...

1341
01:27:42,236 --> 01:27:43,794
I've never told anyone.

1342
01:27:44,705 --> 01:27:46,002
No one.

1343
01:27:46,840 --> 01:27:48,831
Not even to myself.

1344
01:27:50,477 --> 01:27:51,967
But I'm telling you.

1345
01:27:55,349 --> 01:27:58,512
I know I'm not a good actor.

1346
01:28:00,087 --> 01:28:01,748
I lack something.

1347
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:07,484
Mimicking actors,
jumping around, dancing...

1348
01:28:08,329 --> 01:28:09,421
...that's not acting.

1349
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:13,291
But what do I do?

1350
01:28:14,235 --> 01:28:17,136
I can't live without this.

1351
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:20,469
I am in love with movies.

1352
01:28:22,643 --> 01:28:23,701
Sometimes I feel...

1353
01:28:24,211 --> 01:28:26,304
...I was born to entertain.

1354
01:28:29,116 --> 01:28:30,811
I feel, when I make people laugh...

1355
01:28:32,219 --> 01:28:34,084
...I make Him happy as well.

1356
01:28:35,756 --> 01:28:37,849
And the sight of those
smiling faces...

1357
01:28:39,460 --> 01:28:40,950
I swear, it's like a shot of
oxygen to my heart...

1358
01:28:41,028 --> 01:28:44,486
Shut up, idiot...
wanna make me weep?

1359
01:28:45,532 --> 01:28:48,433
My friend, you're my superstar!

1360
01:29:16,864 --> 01:29:18,991
Hello.

1361
01:29:37,985 --> 01:29:40,351
What happened?
Missed the Americans?

1362
01:29:41,755 --> 01:29:42,779
They escaped.

1363
01:29:43,791 --> 01:29:46,988
We set the trap but the bastards
didn't take the bait.

1364
01:29:47,528 --> 01:29:48,426
So now?

1365
01:29:50,497 --> 01:29:51,759
Let's see...

1366
01:29:52,766 --> 01:29:53,824
Son.

1367
01:30:13,287 --> 01:30:14,982
Greetings, Sir!
Greetings!

1368
01:30:15,789 --> 01:30:19,020
I have a small request, sir...

1369
01:30:19,493 --> 01:30:20,619
Go ahead.

1370
01:30:20,828 --> 01:30:24,320
Please spare that child's life.

1371
01:30:29,837 --> 01:30:31,896
I heard about his insolence.

1372
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:34,873
Yet, I spare him.

1373
01:30:35,509 --> 01:30:38,137
He's your son.
He hails from this village.

1374
01:30:38,712 --> 01:30:40,304
I am not talking about Aftab.

1375
01:30:42,015 --> 01:30:43,209
I am talking about Sunny.

1376
01:30:43,684 --> 01:30:44,708
He's a good child.

1377
01:30:45,986 --> 01:30:47,578
Even you abducted him by mistake,
sir.

1378
01:30:48,822 --> 01:30:50,016
I request you...

1379
01:30:50,391 --> 01:30:53,383
...to let free that God's child.

1380
01:31:05,672 --> 01:31:06,434
Fine.

1381
01:31:08,475 --> 01:31:11,273
But we won't risk
helping him cross over.

1382
01:31:12,679 --> 01:31:15,443
We will only drop him to a point.

1383
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:17,309
The rest...

1384
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:19,617
...is his destiny.

1385
01:31:19,787 --> 01:31:20,981
That's our responsibility, sir.

1386
01:31:21,455 --> 01:31:23,514
Aftab is well versed
with the border area.

1387
01:31:23,991 --> 01:31:25,151
He will take him there.

1388
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:28,089
Fine.

1389
01:31:28,595 --> 01:31:29,562
Thank you.

1390
01:31:30,030 --> 01:31:31,759
Thank you very much.
- Allah be with you.

1391
01:31:34,635 --> 01:31:35,567
Brother.

1392
01:31:39,907 --> 01:31:40,737
Mehmood.

1393
01:31:42,476 --> 01:31:45,468
See, these villagers are
more valuable than that boy

1394
01:31:46,380 --> 01:31:47,642
This village is our shield.

1395
01:31:49,149 --> 01:31:52,084
If we make chinks in
our own armor...

1396
01:31:52,986 --> 01:31:54,044
...then our safety...

1397
01:31:55,289 --> 01:31:56,313
...will be in danger.

1398
01:32:11,772 --> 01:32:14,002
"Aren't you brimming
with joy today, huh?"

1399
01:32:15,642 --> 01:32:18,475
I can't believe that
I am going back.

1400
01:32:20,914 --> 01:32:22,472
Brother, I would not have
made it without you.

1401
01:32:23,016 --> 01:32:23,914
Thank you.

1402
01:32:25,319 --> 01:32:27,446
We should thank you, fool.

1403
01:32:28,322 --> 01:32:29,687
We got so much from you.

1404
01:32:30,390 --> 01:32:31,482
From your charades.

1405
01:32:32,359 --> 01:32:34,987
Laughter, fun and frolic.

1406
01:32:35,729 --> 01:32:36,855
We earned so much joy!

1407
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:38,961
Awesome dialogue!

1408
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:42,992
Know what, I know you
really want to make films...

1409
01:32:43,504 --> 01:32:44,630
...that wasn't a fake plan.

1410
01:32:45,038 --> 01:32:46,767
You really want to make a film,
right?

1411
01:32:47,741 --> 01:32:49,140
How would I make film?

1412
01:32:51,078 --> 01:32:51,874
Yes, but how.

1413
01:32:52,179 --> 01:32:53,806
That's just a silly dream.

1414
01:32:56,783 --> 01:32:57,579
Bro!

1415
01:32:59,019 --> 01:33:00,043
Keep my camera.

1416
01:33:01,121 --> 01:33:02,213
It's a gift from me!

1417
01:33:03,557 --> 01:33:05,889
Buddy, happiness has
made you neurotic

1418
01:33:06,860 --> 01:33:08,191
That camera is your life.

1419
01:33:09,296 --> 01:33:10,558
Then think of it...

1420
01:33:11,098 --> 01:33:13,123
...as me leaving behind
my life for you.

1421
01:33:13,967 --> 01:33:15,195
Truly?

1422
01:33:15,636 --> 01:33:17,126
Madly, deeply!"

1423
01:33:25,012 --> 01:33:28,675
One day, I'll watch your film
in India.

1424
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:30,883
Not a pirated copy, mind you...

1425
01:33:31,051 --> 01:33:33,349
...but on the big screen.

1426
01:33:34,221 --> 01:33:35,518
God bless you.

1427
01:33:42,996 --> 01:33:46,363
A wheel inside a wheel.
A car over a wheel.

1428
01:33:46,567 --> 01:33:49,764
The car is my sweet ride.

1429
01:33:49,836 --> 01:33:53,067
A little behind, a little aside...

1430
01:33:53,173 --> 01:33:55,471
A little behind, a little aside...

1431
01:33:56,877 --> 01:34:00,438
A wheel inside a wheel.
A car over a wheel.

1432
01:34:00,647 --> 01:34:03,775
The car is my sweet ride.

1433
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:07,910
Stop the car.
- What happened, Brother?

1434
01:34:16,663 --> 01:34:17,561
What happened?

1435
01:34:19,099 --> 01:34:20,191
Get down.

1436
01:34:20,968 --> 01:34:21,935
Get down.

1437
01:34:27,641 --> 01:34:30,007
Yes, Brother.
- Raise your hands.

1438
01:34:34,615 --> 01:34:35,604
Raise your hands.

1439
01:34:39,987 --> 01:34:41,011
Come on...

1440
01:34:44,725 --> 01:34:45,783
Move!

1441
01:34:53,233 --> 01:34:54,200
Down.

1442
01:35:00,607 --> 01:35:02,006
What are you doing, Brother?

1443
01:35:03,176 --> 01:35:05,007
Our orders are to finish them.

1444
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,971
The villagers will think
they were killed at the border.

1445
01:35:09,449 --> 01:35:10,416
But...

1446
01:35:10,817 --> 01:35:12,751
...I didn't get such an order.

1447
01:35:13,286 --> 01:35:15,720
Its not important to tell
everyone everything.

1448
01:35:21,828 --> 01:35:24,126
We will change this country's
destiny.

1449
01:35:25,499 --> 01:35:27,933
We will turn it into a chaste land.

1450
01:35:31,238 --> 01:35:32,330
And you?

1451
01:35:35,876 --> 01:35:37,173
Didn't I tell you?

1452
01:35:40,313 --> 01:35:42,178
You won't return alive.

1453
01:36:00,901 --> 01:36:02,095
What?

1454
01:36:02,602 --> 01:36:03,728
Brother!

1455
01:36:04,738 --> 01:36:05,932
Let them go.

1456
01:36:08,041 --> 01:36:09,770
We will talk after you lower
your gun.

1457
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:11,241
They're good souls, brother.

1458
01:36:12,112 --> 01:36:13,704
They haven't harmed anyone.

1459
01:36:14,748 --> 01:36:16,511
Let them go.
- Lower your gun.

1460
01:36:16,616 --> 01:36:18,049
After you, brother.

1461
01:36:18,452 --> 01:36:20,977
Lower the gun
or I swear I will shoot.

1462
01:36:21,054 --> 01:36:23,921
In that case, I swear,
there will be two bullets not one.

1463
01:36:24,024 --> 01:36:25,389
Don't be a fool!
Lower your gun!

1464
01:36:25,559 --> 01:36:26,856
After you, brother.

1465
01:36:26,927 --> 01:36:28,087
Lower-your-gun!

1466
01:36:28,195 --> 01:36:29,059
Let them go, brother.

1467
01:36:29,162 --> 01:36:31,221
Lower-your-gun!
- Let them go!

1468
01:36:31,398 --> 01:36:32,797
I said lower your gun.

1469
01:36:32,899 --> 01:36:35,094
Please let them go, brother.
- Lower your gun!

1470
01:36:56,289 --> 01:36:57,449
Brother...

1471
01:36:58,725 --> 01:36:59,657
What did?

1472
01:37:01,895 --> 01:37:03,954
I don't know if this is
right or wrong.

1473
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:07,491
Please just leave.

1474
01:37:08,435 --> 01:37:09,925
But you...

1475
01:37:10,837 --> 01:37:11,997
Aftab...

1476
01:37:12,906 --> 01:37:14,669
You too cross-over.

1477
01:37:16,009 --> 01:37:18,000
These people won't spare you.

1478
01:37:19,012 --> 01:37:20,912
But, Brother...

1479
01:37:22,182 --> 01:37:24,480
Before I change my mind...

1480
01:37:24,851 --> 01:37:26,148
...just leave.

1481
01:37:31,191 --> 01:37:32,283
Run!

1482
01:37:50,210 --> 01:37:51,234
That's the border...

1483
01:37:52,245 --> 01:37:53,974
So shall we? - No.

1484
01:37:54,247 --> 01:37:55,839
No. It's patrolling time.

1485
01:37:56,049 --> 01:37:57,209
Let's wait here for a while.

1486
01:37:57,851 --> 01:38:00,649
We'll go after the soldiers leave.

1487
01:38:01,955 --> 01:38:03,650
But, I don't see anyone.

1488
01:38:04,524 --> 01:38:06,185
They won't email you
before they come.

1489
01:38:10,297 --> 01:38:11,992
Look! Hide!

1490
01:40:15,922 --> 01:40:18,288
Go Sunny... Run!

1491
01:40:18,491 --> 01:40:20,391
I won't leave without you.

1492
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,324
Look, it's impossible for
two people to crossover together.

1493
01:40:23,596 --> 01:40:24,722
You go.

1494
01:40:26,232 --> 01:40:27,426
If you stay here you'll die.

1495
01:40:27,534 --> 01:40:28,762
Don't worry about me...
Just leave!

1496
01:40:28,835 --> 01:40:30,234
I won't leave without you.

1497
01:40:31,538 --> 01:40:33,267
Save yourself.

1498
01:40:33,440 --> 01:40:36,068
Great! I leave the man who's
fighting with his own kind for me...

1499
01:40:36,242 --> 01:40:38,005
...and save myself?

1500
01:40:38,078 --> 01:40:40,569
You know, I am Sunny Arora
not voldermort!

1501
01:40:40,647 --> 01:40:42,638
Stop film referencing
and run, man!

1502
01:40:42,716 --> 01:40:45,150
On my dead body, Butch Cassidy!

1503
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:47,812
For God's sake, please run away!

1504
01:40:48,021 --> 01:40:49,113
I will...

1505
01:40:49,522 --> 01:40:50,284
...but only with you.

1506
01:42:21,281 --> 01:42:24,739
"My land"

1507
01:42:26,052 --> 01:42:29,419
"Or your land."

1508
01:42:30,824 --> 01:42:37,787
"How fruitless is this fight?"

1509
01:42:40,834 --> 01:42:46,397
"Our hearts will be carved
how many times?"

1510
01:42:48,074 --> 01:42:53,842
"Damn their maps and
their infernal lines."

1511
01:43:05,925 --> 01:43:08,325
"I walk blissfully"

1512
01:43:08,962 --> 01:43:10,953
"My free heart wanders."

1513
01:43:11,197 --> 01:43:13,722
"Let me walk."

1514
01:43:13,800 --> 01:43:16,667
"What's the use of living like this?"

1515
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,795
"There should be some sunlight."

1516
01:43:18,905 --> 01:43:22,534
"And some shade."

1517
01:43:22,609 --> 01:43:24,600
"But unbound."

1518
01:43:25,845 --> 01:43:27,608
"I have to walk."

1519
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,079
"Soar."

1520
01:43:29,182 --> 01:43:30,444
"Flow."

1521
01:43:30,683 --> 01:43:32,674
"Live."

1522
01:43:36,322 --> 01:43:40,224
"I am unbound obsession."

1523
01:44:22,468 --> 01:44:24,993
"There is sound of destinations."

1524
01:44:25,338 --> 01:44:29,775
"The path is quiet."

1525
01:44:31,077 --> 01:44:32,704
"No restrictions."

1526
01:44:33,079 --> 01:44:36,014
"I want to lose my way."

1527
01:44:36,082 --> 01:44:38,949
"Lose my way."

1528
01:44:39,285 --> 01:44:44,086
"For me heart is God."

1529
01:44:44,157 --> 01:44:46,921
"Heart is Lord."

1530
01:44:48,228 --> 01:44:56,033
"At times it's insane
and at times it's crazy."

1531
01:44:56,803 --> 01:45:01,740
"I have to go there"

1532
01:45:02,842 --> 01:45:10,510
"Where the earth meets the sky."

1533
01:45:11,417 --> 01:45:13,612
"Laugh openly."

1534
01:45:14,354 --> 01:45:16,481
"Don't look behind."

1535
01:45:16,889 --> 01:45:19,949
"Like moments"

1536
01:45:21,794 --> 01:45:24,319
"I walk blissfully"

1537
01:45:24,764 --> 01:45:26,925
"My free heart wanders."

1538
01:45:27,033 --> 01:45:29,433
"Let me walk."

1539
01:45:29,535 --> 01:45:31,969
"If you try to bound me."

1540
01:45:32,438 --> 01:45:34,429
"How will you do it?"

1541
01:45:34,674 --> 01:45:38,132
"Piercing from the clouds."

1542
01:45:38,244 --> 01:45:41,304
"I am the light."

1543
01:45:41,714 --> 01:45:43,477
"I have to walk."

1544
01:45:43,583 --> 01:45:44,914
"Soar."

1545
01:45:45,018 --> 01:45:46,280
"Flow."

1546
01:45:46,352 --> 01:45:48,013
"Live."

1547
01:45:52,158 --> 01:46:00,122
"I am unbound obsession."

1548
