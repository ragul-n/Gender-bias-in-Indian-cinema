1
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:54,973
''Lonely...''

2
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:06,914
''wayfarer, ''

3
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:23,430
''lonely...''

4
00:01:24,704 --> 00:01:26,672
''journey''

5
00:01:39,986 --> 00:01:45,219
''Don't turn away from me, my love''

6
00:01:46,526 --> 00:01:48,289
''God, ''

7
00:01:48,528 --> 00:01:50,291
''my direction''

8
00:02:36,443 --> 00:02:38,308
''l've found...''

9
00:02:38,478 --> 00:02:40,605
''what l desired, ''

10
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,448
''it's your favour, my love''

11
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:59,395
''l know, you are the one...''

12
00:02:59,933 --> 00:03:02,561
''who is true to my faith''

13
00:03:04,671 --> 00:03:06,571
''ln times of happiness...''

14
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,908
''you are with me, ''

15
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:12,242
''it's your favour, my love''

16
00:03:13,246 --> 00:03:15,407
''God, ''

17
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:17,913
''my direction''

18
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,878
Rahul!

19
00:04:59,452 --> 00:05:01,420
Go inside.
- You had me scared

20
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:04,887
Were you sleeping?
By God, you are the limit

21
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:08,218
People dream when they are sleeping,
but you are a daydreamer. Go on

22
00:05:08,428 --> 00:05:11,886
Might be a dream for you,
it's reality for me

23
00:05:12,165 --> 00:05:15,066
All right then, let me go.
- Wait

24
00:05:15,602 --> 00:05:17,570
lt's my turn.
- Make it fast, sir

25
00:05:19,072 --> 00:05:21,905
Please hurry up.
- Back off. l'm already under pressure

26
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:24,406
l'll do it at five from tomorrow.
- Why don't you sleep here at nights?

27
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:29,574
People start dreaming in the queue!
They don't care about others

28
00:05:29,949 --> 00:05:31,280
Back off

29
00:05:38,258 --> 00:05:40,249
Here, l've fixed it

30
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,468
Dreaming again?

31
00:05:50,236 --> 00:05:55,196
Why did you come to Dubai from lndia
if you are not interested in working?

32
00:05:55,508 --> 00:05:59,877
This is not my destiny. l'm here to
make it big. ln months, not years

33
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:05,210
l agree, dreaming is not bad,
but madness for a dream is

34
00:06:05,485 --> 00:06:08,454
You guys are mad,
rotting in this desert

35
00:06:08,688 --> 00:06:10,883
You could've rotted in the deserts
of Rajasthan

36
00:06:11,557 --> 00:06:14,048
Now look, we are in this desert
not by choice

37
00:06:14,594 --> 00:06:18,394
You might be educated, but there are
lots young men with several degrees

38
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:21,566
Can't help it.
Our agents conned us

39
00:06:22,035 --> 00:06:23,900
We were promised better

40
00:06:24,671 --> 00:06:26,901
But when we came here,
everything went haywire

41
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,108
Why don't you complain then?

42
00:06:29,542 --> 00:06:32,238
Didn't you complain?
What happened to it?

43
00:06:32,679 --> 00:06:34,909
Well...
- They'll deport us

44
00:06:35,748 --> 00:06:37,909
l can't afford that,
my house is mortgaged

45
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:42,277
You are lucky. l sold my house

46
00:06:42,689 --> 00:06:44,919
We have to struggle,
not for ourselves though,

47
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,424
to help our dear ones live.
- Because they dream more than us

48
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:54,289
l too have constraints,
but l never let them pull me down

49
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:58,867
Make your weaknesses your strength.
Okay?

50
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:00,869
Come on ! Letters

51
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:03,542
Let's go.
- Letters

52
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:06,208
Come on.
- Coming

53
00:07:36,476 --> 00:07:38,569
l've got mail

54
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:41,239
Hi Parvez-bhai

55
00:07:42,682 --> 00:07:43,706
C'mon !

56
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:46,908
What happened?
- Not working

57
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:53,920
Hello?

58
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:56,858
Thank you

59
00:07:57,063 --> 00:07:58,860
Hello mummy? How are you?

60
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:04,864
''l've received a letter
full of love, ''

61
00:08:05,405 --> 00:08:10,206
''with the fragrance of my home''

62
00:08:31,297 --> 00:08:35,893
''Reading it, my eyes go wet...''

63
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,230
''as they shed tears''

64
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:56,520
''l've received a letter
full of love, ''

65
00:08:57,156 --> 00:09:01,855
''with the fragrance of my home''

66
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:30,886
''Don't come over this time, my love''

67
00:09:31,924 --> 00:09:36,884
''Let's bear this separation''

68
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:05,419
''We'll save on some money, ''

69
00:10:06,359 --> 00:10:11,262
''to buy jewellery for our daughter''

70
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,930
''While l write, my eyes brim
with tears''

71
00:10:23,676 --> 00:10:28,443
''Who has a hold over his heart?''

72
00:10:32,451 --> 00:10:37,445
''l've received a letter
full of love, ''

73
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:42,751
''with the fragrance of my home''

74
00:11:01,147 --> 00:11:06,278
''The mother's old eyes, ''

75
00:11:06,953 --> 00:11:11,913
''run through every corner
of the house''

76
00:11:35,648 --> 00:11:40,608
''She still serves food for her son
every day...''

77
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:46,457
''in anticipation of his arrival''

78
00:11:53,165 --> 00:11:57,898
''Every moment her heart grieves''

79
00:11:58,671 --> 00:12:03,404
''For, a mother's love is unceasing''

80
00:12:07,346 --> 00:12:12,409
''l've received a letter
full of love, ''

81
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:17,419
''with the fragrance of my home''

82
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:49,949
''The cool shade of the banyan,''

83
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:55,391
''our village, so blessed''

84
00:13:19,618 --> 00:13:24,248
''The alleys of the countryside
beckon us''

85
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:30,259
''So do the fragrant flowers''

86
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:35,928
''The nights of separation will pass''

87
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:41,936
''For, the fireflies are so eager
to light up the nights''

88
00:13:45,244 --> 00:13:50,443
''l've received a letter
full of love, ''

89
00:13:51,016 --> 00:13:55,385
''with the fragrance of my home''

90
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:07,555
''Reading it, my eyes go wet...''

91
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:13,395
''as they shed tears''

92
00:14:56,115 --> 00:14:58,049
You are in tears, Parvezbhai?

93
00:14:58,584 --> 00:15:00,552
l...? Not at all

94
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,552
You've wiped your tears,
but your eyes can't hide your sorrow

95
00:15:06,325 --> 00:15:08,225
What's the matter?

96
00:15:08,928 --> 00:15:12,887
When l miss my family,
it hurts

97
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,397
l can't weep before everyone,
so in the bathroom...

98
00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:22,908
l read the letter to take the load
off my chest

99
00:15:25,211 --> 00:15:27,577
l haven't seen my family
for five years

100
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,578
What...? You haven't been home
for five years?

101
00:15:31,183 --> 00:15:33,913
How could l ? l have no money

102
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:38,584
l send half my income back home

103
00:15:39,692 --> 00:15:42,422
And of the other half,
some is spent on myself...

104
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:46,995
and some l save
for my daughter's wedding

105
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:51,102
How many children do you have?

106
00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:54,428
Two

107
00:15:55,908 --> 00:15:58,536
A son and a daughter. Look

108
00:16:00,045 --> 00:16:02,536
My son. He was one
when l came here

109
00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:06,880
Now he's six.
And this is my daughter

110
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:11,886
She was ten then. Now we're even
receiving proposals for her marriage

111
00:16:13,659 --> 00:16:16,560
l can only see my children
grow up in pictures

112
00:16:27,473 --> 00:16:29,441
Who says these folks are alive?

113
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:34,407
They die every moment,
to keep their dear ones alive

114
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,428
Okay, l'll do it

115
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:53,427
You sent for me?

116
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,190
Yes, Rahul

117
00:16:56,635 --> 00:17:01,368
l had warned you.
You don't work, you just shirk work

118
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:07,071
l receive a lot of complaints.
You are always dreaming

119
00:17:07,413 --> 00:17:09,540
Say anything about my work, sir

120
00:17:10,182 --> 00:17:12,548
But you have no right to
ridicule my dreams

121
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,380
My dreams are personal,

122
00:17:18,123 --> 00:17:20,057
you have no right to comment

123
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:22,390
Aren't you impolite?

124
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:25,355
l can sack you, you know?

125
00:17:25,631 --> 00:17:30,898
You can't. Because you are also
a servant like me... sir

126
00:17:32,037 --> 00:17:37,441
How dare you?
You compare yourself with me?

127
00:17:39,278 --> 00:17:44,045
Where do you stand?
And do you know what's my status?

128
00:17:46,352 --> 00:17:50,914
We are poles apart!
- Hardly. Just ten bucks apart

129
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:57,187
Just that my coffin will be
cheaper than yours

130
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,528
And that difference too matters
only to this world

131
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,030
Because after burial,
we'll be on the same level

132
00:18:05,904 --> 00:18:09,362
After that, no one is a manager,
no one is a servant,

133
00:18:10,442 --> 00:18:12,876
no one is rich, no one is poor

134
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:16,874
You are fired

135
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:20,383
Get out

136
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,888
You are dismissed right now

137
00:18:26,925 --> 00:18:29,018
Out. Out you go

138
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:31,029
Going

139
00:18:31,163 --> 00:18:33,961
Understand the difference now?
Get out

140
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:22,210
What are you upto? How can you just
take my photo? l don't even know you

141
00:19:22,648 --> 00:19:24,548
l'm doing a research on the labourers
in Dubai

142
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:27,977
What...? Labourers?
Do you take me for a labourer?

143
00:19:29,455 --> 00:19:30,945
Have you no sense of judgement?

144
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:34,557
Mistake. l thought you were...
- A part of the crowd?

145
00:19:34,993 --> 00:19:37,894
l'm not part of the crowd,
l'm going to be famous soon

146
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:40,891
l'll make it big. Take a good look
at me, don't forget me

147
00:19:41,533 --> 00:19:44,229
l won't forget,
l got your picture

148
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:50,898
Past tense.
- What do you mean?

149
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,237
Not anymore

150
00:19:54,113 --> 00:19:55,580
Take it

151
00:19:58,617 --> 00:20:00,084
Crazy idiot

152
00:20:01,286 --> 00:20:04,585
Before someone makes it big,
everyone calls him crazy

153
00:20:13,465 --> 00:20:14,932
''How do l reach....''

154
00:20:15,134 --> 00:20:17,932
''my destination?''

155
00:20:18,337 --> 00:20:21,306
''l'm in a tight spot, my love''

156
00:20:22,207 --> 00:20:24,437
''God...''

157
00:20:24,643 --> 00:20:26,611
''leads me''

158
00:20:40,492 --> 00:20:44,952
''Lonely is my journey''

159
00:21:28,307 --> 00:21:29,274
You...?

160
00:21:34,513 --> 00:21:37,949
l won't lie in this holy place

161
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:41,944
l'm a Hindu

162
00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:44,956
And l haven't eaten since days

163
00:21:45,724 --> 00:21:47,692
That's why l came here

164
00:21:48,393 --> 00:21:51,954
You can punish me as you will

165
00:21:56,668 --> 00:22:00,570
As for judgement, God alone decides.
We have no right

166
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,901
Only He punishes and pardons

167
00:22:06,612 --> 00:22:09,979
lf we punish you,
God will punish us

168
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,244
You aren't here by yourself,
it's His will

169
00:22:17,623 --> 00:22:20,922
Eat. Eat without fear

170
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:25,590
God meant it for you

171
00:22:29,968 --> 00:22:32,436
lt's time for my namaz,
l'll leave

172
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,392
What happened, sir?
- The owner of this restaurant is crazy

173
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,898
l spoke some things against Amitabh
Bachchan and he got me thrown out

174
00:23:05,737 --> 00:23:07,568
He's pigheaded

175
00:23:10,142 --> 00:23:11,700
''BlG B RESTAURANT''

176
00:23:17,616 --> 00:23:19,914
l'd rather sell chick-peas,

177
00:23:20,385 --> 00:23:22,910
l'd rather shut my restaurant,

178
00:23:23,388 --> 00:23:26,255
l'd rather be a porter,

179
00:23:26,959 --> 00:23:29,427
l'd rather be a cabby,

180
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:33,928
but l can't stand customers
who speak ill of Bachchan saheb

181
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:40,605
Big B, forget it.
- No, it's not a joke

182
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:46,441
Speaking bad about Bachchan saheb!
l can't stand it, brother

183
00:23:47,012 --> 00:23:50,948
lt's a grave insult. He says
he doesn't watch Amitabh's movies...

184
00:23:51,183 --> 00:23:53,947
so he won't eat in his name either.
- Very bad

185
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:58,215
You tell me, what's wrong
with this menu card?

186
00:23:59,925 --> 00:24:01,893
Look...
Mincemeat Lawaris (lllegitimate)

187
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,028
Wow! l can feel the taste

188
00:24:04,262 --> 00:24:06,162
Manly Chicken Lollipop.
- Wow

189
00:24:06,331 --> 00:24:07,889
Emperor Mutton.
- Wonderful

190
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,499
Smoking Potatoes

191
00:24:09,735 --> 00:24:11,396
Helpless Spicy Fish

192
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:13,967
Caretaker Tea.
- So pleasing, sir

193
00:24:14,306 --> 00:24:15,398
Happy Coffee

194
00:24:17,342 --> 00:24:18,900
Stormy Yoghurt.
- Wow, wow, wow

195
00:24:19,177 --> 00:24:21,236
l have all of Big B's movies
in the menu

196
00:24:24,116 --> 00:24:26,584
Sir... where are your feet?

197
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,417
Bless you

198
00:24:30,956 --> 00:24:33,424
l guess you are also
Big B's fan like me

199
00:24:33,658 --> 00:24:36,923
lf l had my way, l'd be around him
like a fan

200
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:41,928
Sometimes l too think the same

201
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:49,930
l know that he doesn't use a fan,
but an air-conditioner

202
00:24:53,378 --> 00:24:55,209
What's your name?

203
00:24:57,082 --> 00:24:58,379
Shahenshah

204
00:24:59,451 --> 00:25:02,545
ln relation, l'm like your father.
What do you do?

205
00:25:03,321 --> 00:25:06,552
l want to do something incredible.
- l got it

206
00:25:07,125 --> 00:25:10,060
You have the resolve
but bad times hold you back

207
00:25:10,662 --> 00:25:13,893
But l'm not a fraud.
- Because your conscience is alive

208
00:25:15,434 --> 00:25:18,403
God is witness, l'm not a traitor.
- So you are loyal?

209
00:25:19,604 --> 00:25:23,404
That's why l sweat blood
in the path of fire

210
00:25:23,942 --> 00:25:26,570
So you want to fix your own destiny?

211
00:25:27,946 --> 00:25:32,576
Right. And it comes
from the Shahenshah (Emperor) himself

212
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:37,417
And if this court employs you...?

213
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:40,923
Then this man shall topple
all hurdles,

214
00:25:42,627 --> 00:25:46,427
break all shackles
and multiply your assets

215
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:54,265
All right. l trust you,
you will honour your uniform

216
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:57,038
Chote Miyan...
- Yes...?

217
00:25:57,509 --> 00:26:01,878
He is our manager from now on.
Show him the job

218
00:26:02,047 --> 00:26:03,207
Well...?
- Get going

219
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:05,212
Thank you, sir

220
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:08,211
Hera and Pheri, get back to work

221
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,622
Big B, l love you

222
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,391
Some day Rahul Group of lndustries
will have its offices...

223
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,068
in every building in this skyline

224
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:29,904
My dream will certainly come true,
very soon

225
00:26:31,343 --> 00:26:32,401
Very soon

226
00:26:33,678 --> 00:26:36,408
l bought a lottery ticket
in your name,

227
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:39,912
because l'm always unlucky.
- Why do you blow up money?

228
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:43,417
Don't worry, half the jackpot is yours.
- l believe in hardwork

229
00:26:43,955 --> 00:26:45,923
Carry on the hardwork,
l believe in blowing it up

230
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:50,417
Goodness! lt's the touchy chap.
Where do l hide?

231
00:26:51,596 --> 00:26:55,532
lt'll be fun when l carry home
a mannequin instead of a wife

232
00:26:55,901 --> 00:26:57,869
lt won't at least demand...
- Hang on

233
00:26:59,571 --> 00:27:01,198
l've seen her somewhere

234
00:27:01,573 --> 00:27:02,540
Whom?

235
00:27:05,443 --> 00:27:08,037
lt's a statue, how can you...?

236
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,379
She's the one l saw at the waterfront,
l told you

237
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,380
Of late, you've been mistaking every
girl in Dubai for the waterfront girl

238
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:22,388
No...
- Watch it. lf you are heard...! C'mon

239
00:27:43,081 --> 00:27:44,912
She's the one

240
00:27:47,252 --> 00:27:48,913
She even laughs

241
00:27:57,229 --> 00:27:59,356
At first meeting,
l thought you were rude

242
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:01,599
But you turned out to be
quite interesting

243
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,360
You have introduced yourself,
but tell me, who do you have in lndia?

244
00:28:06,238 --> 00:28:10,402
My parents, young brother and sister.
l'm responsible for them, but...

245
00:28:11,977 --> 00:28:14,377
l never let the responsibilities
grow into my weakness

246
00:28:16,715 --> 00:28:20,207
Are you a native?
- Yes, l was born here

247
00:28:20,652 --> 00:28:24,986
My parents are also settled here.
Well, what are you into these days?

248
00:28:26,458 --> 00:28:28,949
As of now, looking for a good job

249
00:28:29,561 --> 00:28:31,552
l can help you

250
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:32,897
How?

251
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:35,961
My dad is a reputed businessman.
l'll recommend you for a job

252
00:28:37,102 --> 00:28:38,069
No

253
00:28:38,603 --> 00:28:39,570
Why not?

254
00:28:39,938 --> 00:28:42,406
Because, we are friends now...

255
00:28:42,941 --> 00:28:44,909
Can't l help my friend?

256
00:28:45,076 --> 00:28:49,410
You can, but... my conscience
won't allow me

257
00:28:50,682 --> 00:28:51,910
Okay

258
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,860
lt was great

259
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,367
You eat well.
- Dammit

260
00:29:11,703 --> 00:29:14,866
At Big B's, we get to eat only movies

261
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,932
This is real food.
- Thanks for the food anyway

262
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:23,873
What thanks? lt's the lottery ticket
l had bought in your name

263
00:29:25,183 --> 00:29:26,878
The 500 dirhams ticket?
- Yes

264
00:29:27,385 --> 00:29:30,354
lt comes to 12,000 Pakistani rupees.
l hit it

265
00:29:30,722 --> 00:29:33,384
Wow. Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you too

266
00:29:33,658 --> 00:29:37,389
You heard me burp, didn't you?
lt takes 100 dirhams

267
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:42,899
Out of the rest, 200 belongs to me
and 200...

268
00:29:43,101 --> 00:29:45,069
belongs to you.
- Oh no, you keep it, Anwar

269
00:29:45,670 --> 00:29:47,228
All right

270
00:29:48,473 --> 00:29:52,910
lt's my lucky money.
l'll buy more lottery tickets

271
00:29:53,244 --> 00:29:57,908
This time, l'll buy two,
one for me, one for you

272
00:29:58,249 --> 00:29:59,910
You won't work hard

273
00:30:00,218 --> 00:30:02,083
Work hard, what for?

274
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:08,022
This fun and this laziness
will make me a millionaire someday

275
00:30:09,227 --> 00:30:11,092
No? Let's go home

276
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:15,466
Go on, l'll leave after sometime

277
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:18,302
Why? Won't you go home?

278
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:21,433
l haven't a home

279
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:23,940
You don't have a house,
what do you mean?

280
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:26,105
Go on, Anwar, l'll leave later

281
00:30:27,178 --> 00:30:30,944
Who told you, you don't have one?
Whose house is mine after all?

282
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:34,948
Oh no Anwar, please carry on.
Believe me...

283
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:37,278
Come on.
- Carry on Anwar

284
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:39,957
No arguments. Come on, quick

285
00:30:41,526 --> 00:30:42,493
Come on

286
00:30:42,727 --> 00:30:46,163
l'll show you. My house is
just behind this road

287
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:50,461
Try to understand Anwar...
- lt's akin to the alleys of Lahore

288
00:30:52,003 --> 00:30:53,630
Come to Lahore

289
00:30:58,276 --> 00:30:59,903
What's all this?

290
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:02,413
lt's not stolen

291
00:31:02,614 --> 00:31:07,916
l've been staying in this country
illegally, but these are mine

292
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:12,419
No wonder you hide from cops.
- Can't help it. lf they check me,

293
00:31:12,624 --> 00:31:15,923
they'll deport me,
or jail me

294
00:31:18,129 --> 00:31:21,929
When did you buy all these things?
- l didn't buy them

295
00:31:23,168 --> 00:31:25,193
Picked them up from trash.
- Meaning?

296
00:31:25,503 --> 00:31:27,937
l'll explain, come on

297
00:31:29,507 --> 00:31:31,941
The Arabs are very rich

298
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:35,442
When things get a little older,
they just trash them

299
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,609
And l bring them home.
Look at this

300
00:31:39,984 --> 00:31:43,943
ltalian sofa. Check it out.
You'll enjoy it

301
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:46,123
Jump on it

302
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:50,460
Enjoyed? And this is the
hottest item... iron box

303
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:53,290
lt still works great.
And here's the piano

304
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:57,433
lt's for my Rinky,
she's going to be a musician

305
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:02,902
Try it, you'll enjoy it.
- lt's great

306
00:32:03,475 --> 00:32:08,242
And let me show you the video games,
the teddy bear and lots more

307
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,914
What's that?
- Don't you know?

308
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,916
Great. lt's for my Dinky.
My wife Shabana's demand

309
00:32:18,156 --> 00:32:21,421
Now my confession.
l have tried all kinds of beds,

310
00:32:21,693 --> 00:32:25,595
Belgium, France, Switzerland, ltaly,
but sleep is something...

311
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:30,263
that comes only in the bed
of our motherland. ln our own soil

312
00:32:30,502 --> 00:32:32,595
Anwar, listen...
that's my place

313
00:32:33,004 --> 00:32:37,441
Oh no. lt's your house, the bed
is yours, go to sleep

314
00:32:37,709 --> 00:32:39,609
You are so tired

315
00:32:41,513 --> 00:32:44,949
Shabana! Don't invade my dreams

316
00:32:52,056 --> 00:32:53,956
Discuss something else,
else l'm leaving

317
00:32:54,158 --> 00:32:58,390
Okay, here's a supervisor's job.
The company deals in hoardings. Try it

318
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:01,394
lf l wanted to be a supervisor,
my present job is not bad

319
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:03,897
l don't want to do all this.
- No for everything

320
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:06,901
What do you want to do anyway?
- Why do you bother about me?

321
00:33:07,272 --> 00:33:09,240
Because you are an lndian

322
00:33:09,474 --> 00:33:12,910
There are so many lndians here,
why aren't you worried about them?

323
00:33:13,111 --> 00:33:15,909
There are thousands of lndians here,
that doesn't mean l must love everyone

324
00:33:16,114 --> 00:33:18,582
What do you mean?
- One falls in love not with thousands,

325
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:20,918
but one. And l'm in love,
with you

326
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,418
Fine, but why are you fuming?
You could say that lovingly

327
00:33:33,031 --> 00:33:38,936
''You are like a butterfly
on the moon''

328
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:45,940
''You are the lingering fragrance
of the blossoms''

329
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:56,385
''Coiled in the arms of the night, ''

330
00:33:56,621 --> 00:34:02,890
''you are the shyness
of the quivering lips''

331
00:34:09,934 --> 00:34:16,271
''l'm like a butterfly
on the moon''

332
00:34:16,941 --> 00:34:23,244
''l'm the lingering fragrance
of the blossoms''

333
00:34:31,222 --> 00:34:33,588
''Coiled in the arms of the night, ''

334
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:39,919
''l am the shyness
of the quivering lips''

335
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:06,556
''You tresses are like the clouds, ''

336
00:35:08,593 --> 00:35:12,893
''that the breeze envy''

337
00:35:34,952 --> 00:35:38,285
''Believe it or not...''

338
00:35:38,756 --> 00:35:43,921
''it's your love that shows
in these miraculous sights''

339
00:35:45,196 --> 00:35:50,930
''You are the sweet sting of evenings''

340
00:35:51,636 --> 00:35:57,871
''l'm like a butterfly on the moon''

341
00:36:39,751 --> 00:36:44,916
''ln you, l have found the world''

342
00:36:46,691 --> 00:36:50,923
''There's no one quite like you''

343
00:37:13,284 --> 00:37:15,878
''This heart belongs to you,
this life too''

344
00:37:16,921 --> 00:37:21,881
''l'm crazy for your love''

345
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:36,237
''l'm like a butterfly on the moon''

346
00:37:37,608 --> 00:37:40,907
''Coiled in the arms of the night, ''

347
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:46,907
''Coiled in the arms of the night, ''

348
00:37:47,185 --> 00:37:53,420
''l am the shyness
of the quivering lips''

349
00:37:54,025 --> 00:37:59,861
''You are like a butterfly
on the moon''

350
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,204
Hurry up. Another hoarding has
to be put up at Khmera beach

351
00:38:14,178 --> 00:38:16,544
Looks nice. The client will like it.
- Yes sir

352
00:38:16,914 --> 00:38:20,372
As per the survey, 0.11 million
people will watch it daily

353
00:38:24,121 --> 00:38:25,554
You see that?

354
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:29,250
Do you see my face on it?

355
00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:33,163
No

356
00:38:33,998 --> 00:38:36,899
Never mind. l see it

357
00:38:38,936 --> 00:38:40,904
The entire world will see it soon

358
00:38:44,275 --> 00:38:46,243
Do you see the cattle...?

359
00:38:47,678 --> 00:38:49,441
the traffic?

360
00:38:50,481 --> 00:38:52,449
Circumstances make them do so much

361
00:38:55,186 --> 00:38:57,177
But l don't want to be a part
of the cattle

362
00:38:59,223 --> 00:39:01,191
My path is different

363
00:39:01,626 --> 00:39:04,857
My own path,
the path of success,

364
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,867
my direction

365
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:37,222
See these hoardings?
l've planted 80 percent of them

366
00:39:37,929 --> 00:39:40,898
The company has profited a lot,
so the manager has given me a raise

367
00:39:43,301 --> 00:39:45,394
Hello? Where are you lost?

368
00:39:47,071 --> 00:39:52,703
Rahul, you work so well for others.
Why don't you set up your own business?

369
00:39:53,945 --> 00:39:56,914
And my hoardings top all the hoardings
in the skyline of Dubai?

370
00:39:58,215 --> 00:40:03,585
You can only see the hoardings,
but l can see the stars...

371
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:07,918
gleaming your name at nights
in this country

372
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:10,092
Hang on. Come again?

373
00:40:13,965 --> 00:40:15,933
lt's pleasing to hear

374
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:24,942
Hello?
- Hello Shabana, speak

375
00:40:25,276 --> 00:40:28,268
Hello? Can you hear me?

376
00:40:28,779 --> 00:40:33,614
Your hello-hello is driving
the bill up,

377
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:37,120
but you just don't speak.
Say what you want to

378
00:40:38,289 --> 00:40:40,951
What the hell! Hello

379
00:40:41,492 --> 00:40:43,619
Why don't you speak, my mother?

380
00:40:44,295 --> 00:40:49,460
God! l haven't even spoken
and you want to speak to your mother

381
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:54,763
Not my mother, l want the mother
of my eight kids to speak

382
00:40:55,106 --> 00:40:56,903
Speak! Or l'll hang up!

383
00:40:57,074 --> 00:40:59,907
No, don't hang up

384
00:41:00,111 --> 00:41:05,913
l have received everything
that you sent. But this is not fair

385
00:41:06,117 --> 00:41:10,417
You've sent the remote, but
not the TV. l haven't got a TV yet

386
00:41:11,155 --> 00:41:13,919
That's all l found in the trash

387
00:41:14,625 --> 00:41:17,924
What do you mean?
- l mean... you won't understand

388
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:22,429
Actually, l'll be sending the TV
and spare parts in installments

389
00:41:23,401 --> 00:41:26,302
All right. You can send the TV later

390
00:41:26,637 --> 00:41:32,269
But what's important is
a refrigerator

391
00:41:32,977 --> 00:41:34,467
Refrigerator. Why?

392
00:41:34,712 --> 00:41:40,947
Why? What do you know?
Our neighbour, that wretch Salma

393
00:41:41,218 --> 00:41:43,448
She has bought a refrigerator.
And know what?

394
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:47,446
She's been flaunting it everyday
and drinking chilled sherbet

395
00:41:47,992 --> 00:41:53,953
And her kids!
They hog on ice-cream...

396
00:41:54,165 --> 00:41:56,895
before my kids.
And my innocent kids...

397
00:41:57,301 --> 00:42:01,897
are left sucking their thumbs.
Just send a refrigerator, period

398
00:42:05,943 --> 00:42:10,403
Dammit! Every woman,
after marriage...

399
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:13,910
loves every thing
more than her husband

400
00:42:14,251 --> 00:42:17,448
She tells me, she tells Anwar...

401
00:42:18,489 --> 00:42:20,923
''Whether you come or not,
send the refrigerator''

402
00:42:21,692 --> 00:42:24,252
Damn the refrigerator
... l have to send it

403
00:42:25,296 --> 00:42:27,423
But where do l find one?

404
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:34,932
God! You do exist

405
00:42:36,173 --> 00:42:39,438
Forget the skeptics,
You are great

406
00:42:40,377 --> 00:42:44,939
Jumbo refrigerator!
Thank you

407
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:47,951
Shabana, eat chilled food now

408
00:42:50,788 --> 00:42:52,949
Silver coloured! Automatic ice...

409
00:42:54,692 --> 00:42:57,889
Police? Damn, l'm checking
a refrigerator

410
00:42:58,095 --> 00:43:03,397
lf the cops check me, l'll be
deported to Lahore. Dammit

411
00:43:03,601 --> 00:43:05,569
What do l do?

412
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,928
ls this a refrigerator?
Or a boat?

413
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:39,467
Where are they taking me? l think
they want to catch me redhanded

414
00:43:45,509 --> 00:43:50,276
Why am l sweating inside
a refrigerator? lt's supposed to be...

415
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:53,278
Fool! lt's not wired

416
00:44:12,603 --> 00:44:14,230
They are going to dump me

417
00:44:16,607 --> 00:44:18,404
Done! Now what?

418
00:44:48,606 --> 00:44:51,439
Hurry up, l got work to do.
- Not even half-hour since you came

419
00:44:51,642 --> 00:44:54,270
How can you talk about leaving?
- l'm in the very fast track

420
00:44:54,478 --> 00:44:57,538
lf l slow down a bit, someone might
overtake me. And l won't let that happen

421
00:44:57,915 --> 00:44:59,883
C'mon, hurry up.
l paid the bill half-hour ago

422
00:45:00,251 --> 00:45:02,879
Must you rush on everything?
- lt is

423
00:45:03,654 --> 00:45:07,886
l want to make it big and achieve
my aim at the soonest. So l never delay

424
00:45:08,092 --> 00:45:11,892
Was l slow in professing my love?
- Lie. l professed before you did

425
00:45:12,263 --> 00:45:16,393
Oh yes, you did. Then l'll
proposition for marriage first

426
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:19,561
This is not happening after marriage.
lf you go to office at ten,

427
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:23,236
you will return at sharp six.
You won't make me wait at the door

428
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:26,065
That's the biggest problem women have

429
00:45:26,944 --> 00:45:30,277
After marriage, you get bored at home,
you fall into an identity crisis...

430
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:32,449
and then you need a job!
This is not happening

431
00:45:32,683 --> 00:45:35,914
Stay at home, raise kids.
lt's my family tradition

432
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:38,414
Rahul, you take your own decisions

433
00:45:38,622 --> 00:45:41,250
Now you've also taken decisions
for me, without even asking me

434
00:45:42,493 --> 00:45:46,429
l'll break all norms.
Come on, l have to make it big

435
00:45:55,572 --> 00:45:57,540
Neha...
- Yes mama?

436
00:45:57,941 --> 00:45:59,670
Come here

437
00:46:00,911 --> 00:46:03,539
Yes mama?
- What took you so long?

438
00:46:05,082 --> 00:46:07,380
Actually, l'd been to Rukhsana's

439
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:10,385
l'll be in my room upstairs, mama.
Bye

440
00:46:16,593 --> 00:46:18,561
Hello?
- Hello aunt, Rukhsana here

441
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:20,556
How are you, Rukhsana?
- Fine

442
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:23,399
Neha was with you, wasn't she?
- No

443
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:28,397
All right. Hold on,
l'll give her the line

444
00:46:32,676 --> 00:46:34,906
Neha, take the call.
- Okay mama

445
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:40,450
Why did Neha lie to me?

446
00:46:42,186 --> 00:46:45,917
ls she having an affair with someone?

447
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:01,867
Parvezbhai, is everything all right?
What happened to him?

448
00:47:02,306 --> 00:47:03,364
Heart attack

449
00:47:03,974 --> 00:47:05,874
He's not willing to go to a hospital

450
00:47:07,277 --> 00:47:10,542
For God's sake, send me to Karachi

451
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,949
Of course.
- No hope for me

452
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:15,550
l want to meet my wife and children

453
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:18,555
ln this condition, you can't travel

454
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:23,386
You know, it's a serious attack.
lf you don't go to a hospital...

455
00:47:23,627 --> 00:47:25,891
it'll be very risky.
- No...

456
00:47:26,196 --> 00:47:28,892
l don't want to get admitted.
- Why not?

457
00:47:29,166 --> 00:47:33,227
l want to see my family.
- You will

458
00:47:34,138 --> 00:47:36,902
l promise. God willing,
you will see them

459
00:47:37,107 --> 00:47:39,905
Now listen to the doctor
and go to the hospital

460
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:43,910
You promise to take me
to my family?

461
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,412
l do, l promise.
- Please

462
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:49,245
Let's go to the hospital.
Come on

463
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:19,545
Parvezbhai...

464
00:48:21,118 --> 00:48:22,881
are you thinking that
l haven't kept my promise?

465
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:27,885
l've organised everything

466
00:48:30,594 --> 00:48:32,562
Just hang on for a little while

467
00:48:35,632 --> 00:48:38,965
You have waited for five years,
Parvezbhai, for my sake

468
00:48:47,444 --> 00:48:49,412
For my sake, for the sake of
your wife and children

469
00:48:50,113 --> 00:48:52,411
Please wait for a while more

470
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:58,186
Let him go.
- He's not leaving me

471
00:48:59,056 --> 00:49:00,853
He won't

472
00:49:02,893 --> 00:49:04,861
He has left.
- What...?

473
00:49:07,898 --> 00:49:09,866
ls this your friendship?

474
00:49:46,737 --> 00:49:49,399
How can l go?
l have no money

475
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:53,405
l send half my income back home

476
00:49:54,611 --> 00:49:57,580
And of the other half,
some is spent on myself...

477
00:49:58,448 --> 00:50:01,417
and some l save
for my daughter's wedding

478
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:58,408
Resignation letter? But why?

479
00:51:00,110 --> 00:51:02,237
l can't work anymore, sir

480
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:07,412
What's the problem?
lf there's something, let's discuss

481
00:51:08,585 --> 00:51:11,418
As for your salary,
l can give you a raise

482
00:51:12,022 --> 00:51:13,922
Nothing of that sort, sir

483
00:51:14,257 --> 00:51:15,918
Rahul, l like you

484
00:51:16,226 --> 00:51:18,922
lt's a tough decision.
You mustn't be hasty

485
00:51:19,229 --> 00:51:21,254
l want you to think again

486
00:51:24,434 --> 00:51:26,595
Sir, l think well before
l take my decisions

487
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:31,270
And once l decide,
l don't go back

488
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,610
Thank you, sir.
- All the best, Rahul

489
00:51:38,281 --> 00:51:40,943
What are you saying?
You are not a rich man

490
00:51:41,985 --> 00:51:45,477
What was the need to resign?
Why did you kick the job?

491
00:51:45,722 --> 00:51:47,952
l was scared.
- Scared of what? lf one is scared,

492
00:51:48,158 --> 00:51:51,616
he hangs on to a job.
But you have quit it

493
00:51:51,995 --> 00:51:54,964
This is silly.
- lt is silly, of course it is

494
00:51:55,098 --> 00:51:58,226
l don't want to do a job
that becomes my weakness

495
00:51:58,935 --> 00:52:00,903
Parvezbhai's death has shaken me up

496
00:52:02,939 --> 00:52:06,898
He was glued to his job, didn't meet
his family for five years, died

497
00:52:08,345 --> 00:52:10,245
l don't want to die

498
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:13,645
l came here to achieve,
not to die

499
00:52:17,688 --> 00:52:19,417
Now what?

500
00:52:20,357 --> 00:52:21,324
Business

501
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:23,919
Business?

502
00:52:24,695 --> 00:52:26,424
My own

503
00:52:27,397 --> 00:52:28,421
Money?

504
00:52:29,132 --> 00:52:31,100
lt'll be done.
Finish your tea

505
00:52:35,005 --> 00:52:36,939
This is my office

506
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:38,430
Hired

507
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:42,277
Soon l'll own it

508
00:52:43,513 --> 00:52:45,481
You don't like it?

509
00:52:45,716 --> 00:52:48,014
Rahul, l'm a little scared

510
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,952
What's scary about it?
You told me to set up my own business

511
00:52:52,222 --> 00:52:54,952
lt's first-class.
- l didn't mean this business

512
00:52:58,028 --> 00:53:03,227
So you think recruitment agencies
con and fleece people, right?

513
00:53:04,267 --> 00:53:06,235
How can you think that about me?

514
00:53:07,137 --> 00:53:11,233
l don't want to con and loot someone,
ln fact, l want to help others

515
00:53:11,441 --> 00:53:13,909
Help? How?
- Look...

516
00:53:14,611 --> 00:53:18,911
of the 3 million population
of UAE, 70 percent are foreigners,

517
00:53:19,116 --> 00:53:23,246
of which 40 percent are lndians,
monopolized by 40 agents

518
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:26,418
These agents sell a visa worth
thousand bucks for hundred-thousand

519
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:29,922
Even l break the monopoly of one agent,
you know how much l stand to gain?

520
00:53:30,127 --> 00:53:32,095
l don't care for profit and loss

521
00:53:32,963 --> 00:53:34,260
Hang on

522
00:53:35,332 --> 00:53:39,268
These are 25 visas.
l bought each for 1000 bucks

523
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:41,937
l'll sell each for 2000 bucks.
Just 2000

524
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:44,437
l'm happy, people are happy.
Now tell me,

525
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:49,935
am l fleecing someone?
- Fine, but l'm not convinced yet

526
00:53:51,982 --> 00:53:54,450
May God set everything right.
- Everything will be fine

527
00:53:59,289 --> 00:54:00,881
Have sweets

528
00:54:01,925 --> 00:54:03,552
You too

529
00:54:05,462 --> 00:54:09,558
Congratulations to me.
Have a sweet

530
00:54:09,933 --> 00:54:11,901
Congratulations to me

531
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:20,576
What's up, Big B?
Why are these sweets for?

532
00:54:21,478 --> 00:54:23,912
Your sister-in-law Jaya
has delivered twins

533
00:54:24,147 --> 00:54:28,447
Wonderful. God's very kind

534
00:54:29,619 --> 00:54:32,247
What would call them?
- l had already decided their names

535
00:54:32,956 --> 00:54:35,925
Abhishek, if it's a boy.
- Shweta, if it's a girl

536
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:41,930
l'm so glad

537
00:54:42,299 --> 00:54:45,928
You must be honoured,
you must be glad

538
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:50,106
Big B

539
00:54:50,307 --> 00:54:53,435
l'm sending 25 visas.
Give Altaf 500,000 bucks

540
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,372
He can't figure it out in dirhams.
- Salaam Aleikom

541
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:02,207
Dubai Crime lnvestigation Department.
And this is my card

542
00:55:02,652 --> 00:55:04,882
Officer Mohammed Al Ahmadi.
You are Rahul?

543
00:55:05,922 --> 00:55:06,889
Yes

544
00:55:07,123 --> 00:55:09,091
You bought 25 visas
from Qadir and Company?

545
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,220
Yes

546
00:55:15,532 --> 00:55:17,898
Please give us all those visas

547
00:55:18,935 --> 00:55:21,961
Why?
- All of them are phony

548
00:55:24,307 --> 00:55:26,275
Mr Rahul, you are lucky

549
00:55:27,644 --> 00:55:29,441
You won't be jailed

550
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:33,409
Because the investigation team...

551
00:55:34,684 --> 00:55:38,245
hasn't accused you.
You are innocent

552
00:55:40,223 --> 00:55:42,919
Those who have carried out this
illegal activity will be jailed

553
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,924
And now...

554
00:55:46,162 --> 00:55:48,096
please give me all the visas

555
00:55:54,204 --> 00:55:58,607
And yes, henceforth be very careful

556
00:55:59,576 --> 00:56:01,407
All the best

557
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:09,252
All thanks to your mistakes

558
00:56:09,653 --> 00:56:13,214
You put yourself in a bind
as well as me

559
00:56:13,657 --> 00:56:16,888
You don't think before you
do something, you are impulsive

560
00:56:19,496 --> 00:56:22,897
Know how many steps this one
wrong step has pulled you back by?

561
00:56:23,934 --> 00:56:26,402
l forbid you,
but you wouldn't listen

562
00:56:27,270 --> 00:56:29,238
Thank God the cops didn't arrest you

563
00:56:29,673 --> 00:56:33,575
Have you ever thought what'd have
happened to me if they did?

564
00:56:34,110 --> 00:56:37,273
So what do l do? l can't help it
if destiny wishes me ill

565
00:56:37,681 --> 00:56:40,411
And instead of giving me courage,
you are screaming at me

566
00:56:40,617 --> 00:56:43,245
l don't want your love.
- l'm sorry, Rahul

567
00:56:43,954 --> 00:56:45,922
l'm really very sorry

568
00:57:13,984 --> 00:57:16,885
You are here! And l looked
for you everywhere

569
00:57:17,587 --> 00:57:21,421
What happened?
- What do you mean? Big B wants you now

570
00:57:22,592 --> 00:57:25,220
Come on, get up. C'mon

571
00:57:29,666 --> 00:57:31,566
Welcome, Rahul

572
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:36,404
l'm glad that you tried
to touch the skies

573
00:57:37,107 --> 00:57:40,907
But the sad part is, you were
not successful. lt happens

574
00:57:41,111 --> 00:57:46,572
lt happens sometimes in life.
Not every movie is a superhit

575
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:49,248
At times, they flop too

576
00:57:50,954 --> 00:57:56,859
But the true merchant is the one
who laughs through his sorrows

577
00:57:57,427 --> 00:58:02,387
Be brave, everything will be all right.
One day you will win over fate

578
00:58:03,099 --> 00:58:06,865
And you will play with destiny. Yes

579
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,368
You will, certainly

580
00:58:11,574 --> 00:58:14,372
ls that what you called me for?
- No, Rahul

581
00:58:15,011 --> 00:58:17,377
My friend owns a farm
hundred miles away

582
00:58:18,081 --> 00:58:21,881
He needs an assistant manager.
l've spoken to him. Take it up

583
00:58:22,986 --> 00:58:27,389
Hundred miles away is the desert.
- You'll be paid 2500 dirhams

584
00:58:28,658 --> 00:58:31,218
Are you crazy? Reason with him, sir.
- What...?

585
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:35,394
That comes to 60,000 Pakistani rupees

586
00:58:37,067 --> 00:58:43,404
lt's not the time to think. You are
ruined as of now, you are in debt

587
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:47,903
Look Rahul, you have used
as many lives as you've had

588
00:58:48,311 --> 00:58:53,248
You have no choice,
you are on your own now

589
00:58:53,616 --> 00:58:55,846
And your time starts now

590
00:58:57,420 --> 00:58:59,388
Okay?
That's good

591
00:59:01,257 --> 00:59:02,849
Thank you, Big B

592
00:59:03,159 --> 00:59:06,219
How do l repay your favour?
- Simple

593
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:11,394
Find out just how much
Bachchan saheb is worth

594
00:59:12,902 --> 00:59:15,871
How can l find out that?
And why do you want to know?

595
00:59:17,707 --> 00:59:21,370
Actually Rahul, in my life,

596
00:59:22,178 --> 00:59:24,146
l don't want to earn more than him

597
00:59:25,582 --> 00:59:27,209
l love you, Big B

598
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:33,050
Will you go away from me?
- Neha, l'm helpless

599
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:36,216
l'm not leaving Dubai anyway,
l'm only going hundred miles away

600
00:59:36,926 --> 00:59:40,384
As l told you, l'll phone you.
l'll also come over on holidays

601
00:59:41,364 --> 00:59:45,892
l told you ! Let me ask daddy
to get you a job here. But you...

602
00:59:46,169 --> 00:59:49,263
Try to understand. l want to
win you, l don't want to lose you

603
00:59:50,673 --> 00:59:52,573
l don't understand

604
00:59:54,711 --> 01:00:00,411
Look, no rich man would marry
his daughter off to his employee

605
01:00:03,953 --> 01:00:07,411
Just think. Would you like me
to work for your dad?

606
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:11,093
Or would you want me to win you?

607
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,255
C'mon

608
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:11,252
May l come in, sir?
- Come in

609
01:01:14,624 --> 01:01:16,421
Good afternoon, sir

610
01:01:17,393 --> 01:01:19,258
Good afternoon

611
01:01:24,267 --> 01:01:28,601
You?
- So you are my new assistant manager?

612
01:01:30,139 --> 01:01:32,107
You, here?
- Shut up

613
01:01:32,976 --> 01:01:34,944
l'm your boss

614
01:01:36,212 --> 01:01:40,615
How dare you question me?
And who gave you this job?

615
01:01:42,986 --> 01:01:45,454
l need an honest person here

616
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:49,124
Not a shirker like you

617
01:01:50,493 --> 01:01:54,953
Forget the past, sir. l have come here
to work sincerely and diligently

618
01:01:55,932 --> 01:01:57,900
l won't give you a chance to complain

619
01:01:58,601 --> 01:02:02,560
So miseries have brought you back
to your senses

620
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:07,573
As you imagine

621
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:11,280
So you haven't broken down yet

622
01:02:12,482 --> 01:02:14,575
l won't break down
until l breathe my last

623
01:02:15,051 --> 01:02:18,578
But as of now, l'm willing
to do whatever you say

624
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,653
Take the keys

625
01:02:25,695 --> 01:02:29,290
Thank you. Keys to my room?

626
01:02:31,634 --> 01:02:36,298
No. To my room.
Go and clean it up!

627
01:02:40,977 --> 01:02:42,945
What happened?

628
01:02:45,648 --> 01:02:47,081
Nothing, sir

629
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:52,950
Don't worry. Something will
surely happen, now that you are here

630
01:03:46,267 --> 01:03:48,827
So the shirking has started off?

631
01:03:49,303 --> 01:03:50,668
l'm sorry, sir

632
01:03:50,838 --> 01:03:52,669
Who will quench the thirst
of the animals?

633
01:03:52,907 --> 01:03:54,169
l will, sir

634
01:03:54,542 --> 01:03:59,502
Won't you feed them before giving
them water? Pick up the fodder

635
01:04:01,215 --> 01:04:05,151
And who will clear the dung?
Pick it up

636
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:10,018
Pick it up, l say

637
01:04:19,834 --> 01:04:23,031
Where to throw it?
- Where else but at a filthy place?

638
01:04:30,511 --> 01:04:32,945
You swine!
What the hell have you done?

639
01:04:33,514 --> 01:04:37,974
Why lose your temper, sir? As you said,
filth is thrown in a filthy place

640
01:04:40,254 --> 01:04:43,485
And l don't find a filthier place
than your face anywhere in Dubai

641
01:04:43,758 --> 01:04:47,489
You are dismissed. Get out from here.
Get out

642
01:04:47,829 --> 01:04:48,989
Get out!

643
01:04:49,197 --> 01:04:54,658
Going. l've given you a memento
that is unforgettable for you

644
01:06:47,782 --> 01:06:49,750
''Thou are the Holy Scripture''

645
01:06:52,186 --> 01:06:54,154
''Thou are the beginning''

646
01:06:56,824 --> 01:06:58,485
''Thou are blessing''

647
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:01,495
''Thou are prayer''

648
01:07:02,263 --> 01:07:04,993
''Read You, l must''

649
01:07:08,269 --> 01:07:10,999
''Read You, l must,
but how do l ?''

650
01:07:11,205 --> 01:07:14,003
''Let me cleanse myself first''

651
01:07:19,747 --> 01:07:24,446
''Thou are the Holy Scripture''

652
01:07:25,753 --> 01:07:30,122
''Thou are the beginning''

653
01:07:58,019 --> 01:07:59,987
''You bless everyone''

654
01:08:00,888 --> 01:08:03,482
''Even dust You honour''

655
01:08:03,824 --> 01:08:05,985
''Just once...''

656
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:08,495
''show me a miracle''

657
01:08:21,208 --> 01:08:23,005
''Thou are the first ray
of the sun''

658
01:08:24,145 --> 01:08:25,908
''Thou are the rosegarden''

659
01:08:32,653 --> 01:08:36,453
''Read You, l must''

660
01:08:38,492 --> 01:08:41,120
''Read You, l must,
but how do l ?''

661
01:08:41,495 --> 01:08:44,464
''Let me cleanse myself first''

662
01:08:50,304 --> 01:08:54,604
''Take away all the sorrows
in the world''

663
01:08:56,043 --> 01:09:00,639
''Awaken the love in every heart, Lord''

664
01:09:13,527 --> 01:09:15,495
''Thou are the Lord''

665
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:18,298
''Thou are prayer from the lips''

666
01:09:25,005 --> 01:09:27,439
''Read You, l must''

667
01:09:30,745 --> 01:09:33,441
''Read You, l must,
but how do l ?''

668
01:09:33,781 --> 01:09:36,614
''Let me cleanse myself first''

669
01:11:48,482 --> 01:11:50,450
What happened?

670
01:11:53,654 --> 01:11:54,780
Careful

671
01:11:57,157 --> 01:11:58,556
Let's go

672
01:12:33,460 --> 01:12:35,428
Excuse me...
- Yes?

673
01:12:35,896 --> 01:12:37,921
Mr Manmohan Kapoor had called me,

674
01:12:38,132 --> 01:12:40,100

l won't give you a chance to complain.
- That's good

690
01:13:48,736 --> 01:13:53,002
Meet the HRD manager, he'll explain
to you all the rules and regulations

691
01:13:53,807 --> 01:13:55,672
And you can join from tomorrow

Thank you so much, sir

693
01:14:00,547 --> 01:14:02,515
All the best.

Hello?

696
01:14:13,727 --> 01:14:16,696
Hello, daddy.
- lt's Neha. How are you, dear?

697
01:14:17,131 --> 01:14:19,190
l'm fine. You are
forgetting something

698
01:14:19,933 --> 01:14:21,901
Am l forgetting something?

699
01:14:22,569 --> 01:14:26,471
l got it. l must've surely promised
you something. Remind me, please

700
01:14:28,509 --> 01:14:30,977
You promised to buy your daughter
a new car

701
01:14:33,714 --> 01:14:36,478
These petty things waste my time, dear

702
01:14:36,950 --> 01:14:38,975
Why don't you go over?
l'll phone them

703
01:14:39,686 --> 01:14:43,144
Which car?
- Any one you like. BMW, Jaguar,

704
01:14:43,857 --> 01:14:45,984
Ford, Mercedez, any car

705
01:14:46,527 --> 01:14:49,496
But not Lexus.
l'm not happy with that car

706
01:14:50,297 --> 01:14:52,492
Okay. l love you, daddy. Thank you

707
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,825
l love you too, dear. Bye

708
01:14:58,839 --> 01:15:02,832
What? You quit the job?
- What else? The same manager again

709
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:08,170
Rahul, will you keep quitting jobs?
You can't always have your way

710
01:15:08,549 --> 01:15:12,508
Got to compromise sometimes in life.
- How long do l compromise?

711
01:15:13,554 --> 01:15:15,522
He was making me pick up horse dung

712
01:15:15,823 --> 01:15:18,018
l threw it on his face!
- What?

713
01:15:18,692 --> 01:15:20,853
Luckily, l found a job here.
- Really?

714
01:15:21,228 --> 01:15:24,459
Let me know where
and who you are working for

715
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:30,969
Also tell me how long it'll take
before you insult him and quit the job?

716
01:15:33,307 --> 01:15:36,140
Why are you silent?
Tell me

717
01:15:36,510 --> 01:15:38,978
l was about to tell you,
but l won't

718
01:15:42,316 --> 01:15:45,808
Rahul, listen to me... stop

719
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,988
l'm not talking to you.
- Listen to me... what is this?

720
01:15:49,523 --> 01:15:51,991
Listen to me... stop

721
01:15:55,529 --> 01:15:58,157
Mr Boight, chief of FMG Corporate,
is here

722
01:15:58,899 --> 01:16:01,868
He wants to appoint a new distributor
for his company

And l want this distributorship

725

So what? We're not smalltime

727
01:16:18,018 --> 01:16:20,009
l didn't mean that, sir

728
01:16:20,754 --> 01:16:23,518
Besides, you are with us

729
01:16:24,491 --> 01:16:27,585
Rahul, l want you to grow
with the company

730
01:16:29,229 --> 01:16:30,457
Best of luck

731
01:17:10,003 --> 01:17:11,834
Excuse me, Mr Boight,

732
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:14,507
l'm sorry, l have no time for you.

You bagged the FMG distributorship
for us

737
01:17:41,702 --> 01:17:45,468
What didn't happen in years
you did it in a few days

738
01:17:45,872 --> 01:17:48,466
Well sir...
- lt's good news

739
01:17:49,977 --> 01:17:51,467
Of course

Hello Rahul? Where are you?

746
01:18:10,197 --> 01:18:12,165
At the Dubai creek.
- Creek?

747
01:18:12,733 --> 01:18:14,496
Which means you are nearby

748
01:18:15,202 --> 01:18:18,000
Why can't l see you?
- To your left

749
01:18:19,539 --> 01:18:21,507

Peep into your heart,

01:18:28,081 --> 01:18:30,447
Stop kidding. Where are you?

752
01:18:30,884 --> 01:18:33,944
Wherever l am, l'm right before you

753
01:18:35,589 --> 01:18:37,454
Before me...?

754
01:18:40,027 --> 01:18:43,463
People will watch.

''Your charm, ''

774
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:42,168
''mesmerizing''

775
01:21:42,543 --> 01:21:44,511
''l belong to you, ''

776
01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:47,047
''my love''

777
01:21:47,314 --> 01:21:51,011

''My true sweetheart''

782
01:22:21,582 --> 01:22:25,985
Very good. Excellent. Ever since
you've been managing the branch...

783
01:22:26,253 --> 01:22:28,983
our turnover has increased
by 35 percent

784
01:22:30,057 --> 01:22:32,992
That's why l feel
l'm underutilising you

785
01:22:33,527 --> 01:22:37,293
So l think of handing you over
the Middle East operations

786
01:22:38,198 --> 01:22:40,996
Manager of Operations
for the entire Middle East

787
01:22:41,735 --> 01:22:44,499

Amazing. Wow. Oh God.

791
01:23:04,825 --> 01:23:07,521
That's the kitchen.
- lt's so nice

792
01:23:07,728 --> 01:23:10,526
l'm so happy, your company
has given you such a beautiful house

793
01:23:13,367 --> 01:23:15,528
Five bedrooms upstairs.

You like it?
- Very much

798
01:23:32,119 --> 01:23:34,553
All l need is a wife

799
01:23:35,255 --> 01:23:37,223
For which you need to meet my daddy

800
01:23:37,925 --> 01:23:39,893
How could you think l'm marrying you?

801
01:23:41,662 --> 01:23:43,562
l'll do that in time

802
01:23:43,931 --> 01:23:45,558
Who is it?

803
01:23:47,034 --> 01:23:49,559
Anwar. Welcome.
Neha, he's my friend

804
01:23:49,737 --> 01:23:52,570
l know. l've heard a lot
about him from you

805
01:23:52,773 --> 01:23:54,001
Salaam Aleikom.
- Waleikom

806
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:57,575
Where did you pick up the trash from?
- You are trashing me before her

807
01:23:57,811 --> 01:23:59,574
Give me a hand

808
01:24:00,381 --> 01:24:04,579
lt's not from trash,
it's brand new. By God

809
01:24:04,818 --> 01:24:08,584
Here's the receipt.
- lt's all right

810
01:24:10,357 --> 01:24:16,125
This time it's a small TV for
the bedroom, along with the remote

811
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:20,598
Actually, l hit the jackpot again
with the ticket l bought in your name

812
01:24:20,834 --> 01:24:26,204
Congratulate me. l shopped till l
dropped, then l bought two more tickets

813
01:24:26,573 --> 01:24:32,534
For both of us, 1000 dirhams each.
l wouldn't ask if it were a few dirhams

814
01:24:32,746 --> 01:24:35,909
Keep the ticket, and pay me 1000.
- Are you crazy? l don't want it

815
01:24:42,322 --> 01:24:43,880
All right

816
01:24:44,725 --> 01:24:47,216
l got it, friend.
See that, lady?

817
01:24:47,795 --> 01:24:51,925
When a person grows in stature,
his heart just shrinks

818
01:24:55,803 --> 01:25:01,241
Anwar may be short,
but his heart pops out

819
01:25:01,775 --> 01:25:06,075
l was only testing him,
who wants his money. Keep it

820
01:25:07,114 --> 01:25:11,244
l don't want it. Take it back.
- Keep it. lt'll remind you of me

821
01:25:19,059 --> 01:25:21,584
All set for the conference, Rahul?
- Yes sir

822
01:25:21,962 --> 01:25:22,929
Sit

823
01:25:33,307 --> 01:25:37,038
Still 25 minutes to go for the
conference. l want to discuss something

824
01:25:37,778 --> 01:25:39,541
l wanted to talk to you
about something

825
01:25:43,851 --> 01:25:47,719
l have a project, sir.
lt's my own hardwork

826
01:25:48,322 --> 01:25:50,222
l wish you could lend me a ear

827
01:25:53,126 --> 01:25:55,094
l won't take more than ten minutes

828
01:25:57,598 --> 01:25:58,724
Go ahead

829
01:26:03,103 --> 01:26:04,730
What are you staring at?

830
01:26:09,109 --> 01:26:11,077
Neha, who is he?

831
01:26:11,612 --> 01:26:15,742
Who, mama?
- Whose love lends glow to your face

832
01:26:18,118 --> 01:26:20,245
What's his name?
- Rahul

833
01:26:21,154 --> 01:26:23,247
What does he do?
- Loves me

834
01:26:24,091 --> 01:26:26,525
lt's obvious.
What work does he do?

835
01:26:28,228 --> 01:26:30,526
He's made it well within
a short span of time

836
01:26:30,898 --> 01:26:34,026
Business?
- No. Works for some company

837
01:26:36,069 --> 01:26:38,037
Mama, he's dynamic,
he's brilliant

838
01:26:39,907 --> 01:26:43,707
Mama, please talk to daddy.
l'm shy

839
01:26:44,778 --> 01:26:50,546
Look Neha, your dad dotes upon you.
He has fulfilled all your wishes

840
01:26:51,318 --> 01:26:55,550
And your life's decision,
he will take, not l

841
01:26:58,592 --> 01:27:01,561
Don't be glum, l'll talk to him
when l get an opportunity

842
01:27:01,828 --> 01:27:03,295
Thank you, sir

843
01:27:09,002 --> 01:27:10,902
You have wasted my half-hour

844
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:13,567
What a stupid project

845
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:15,568
Get out

846
01:27:15,776 --> 01:27:18,074
Sorry, sir.
- l say, go out

847
01:27:24,618 --> 01:27:25,676
Rahul,

848
01:27:29,756 --> 01:27:33,522
years ago, l took the same project
to my boss

849
01:27:34,728 --> 01:27:36,696
And that's how l was reviled

850
01:27:37,898 --> 01:27:39,866
Nonsense! Stupid! Get out

851
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:48,906
lt was my dream project. For years,
l tried to put it in place

852
01:27:49,309 --> 01:27:53,541
l struggled.
And in the maze of life, l was lost

853
01:27:56,750 --> 01:27:58,718
l had even forgotten
about this project

854
01:27:59,753 --> 01:28:04,918
But today, you've brought it up again,
awakened my dormant dream

855
01:28:05,926 --> 01:28:10,226
lf someone can make my dreams
come true, it's you, Rahul

856
01:28:14,134 --> 01:28:16,932
l don't want you to go through
Go ahead with the project

857
01:28:21,341 --> 01:28:23,832
My support is with you.
- Thank you sir

858
01:28:24,211 --> 01:28:26,179
All the best.
- Thank you

859
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,508
Listen...

860
01:28:29,650 --> 01:28:31,515
tell me something

861
01:28:32,352 --> 01:28:35,685
191 : How did you steal the idea
from my mind?

862
01:28:37,224 --> 01:28:38,191
Sir?

863
01:28:39,126 --> 01:28:41,185
Shabana, tell me.
- Hello?

864
01:28:41,561 --> 01:28:44,530
l'm fine, the kids are fine,
my parents are first-class

865
01:28:45,632 --> 01:28:47,600
l didn't ask
about the kids yet

866
01:28:48,168 --> 01:28:52,537
Forget it. l got a small list

867
01:28:53,173 --> 01:28:56,540
And remember. l want all these
before Ramzan Eid

868
01:28:57,077 --> 01:28:59,045
My parents wish that

869
01:28:59,713 --> 01:29:03,547
Shabana, your parents
haven't stopped wishing yet

870
01:29:03,850 --> 01:29:09,550
Good God! You live and work in Dubai.
Can't you fulfill this simple wish?

871
01:29:10,190 --> 01:29:13,557
Listen carefully.
Prayer mat for father

872
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:17,054
Medicinal oil for mother,
for her joint pains

873
01:29:17,364 --> 01:29:21,562
For Pinky, get a gold locket,
''Allah'' inscribed

874
01:29:21,768 --> 01:29:25,499
And the same earrings for Dinky
which you had sent for Rinky

875
01:29:25,672 --> 01:29:29,836
Remember?
And toothbrush for the little one

876
01:29:31,078 --> 01:29:33,046
Hello? Listening, aren't you?

877
01:29:33,213 --> 01:29:35,181
Oh... yes

878
01:29:35,749 --> 01:29:39,185
Why don't you write it?
Or you'll forget. Write

879
01:29:39,553 --> 01:29:44,513
Rehana wants a two-in-one stereo.
Rizwana wants a three-in-one

880
01:29:44,758 --> 01:29:49,718
And Noor wants a colour TV.
Tasleem wants a hair dryer. That's all

881
01:29:50,297 --> 01:29:53,027
Oh yes, Won't you give something
to your brother-in-law?

882
01:29:54,234 --> 01:29:57,863
Why don't you send a discman
for Harshad?

883
01:29:58,839 --> 01:30:02,536
And don't forget my list

884
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:07,206
l want six pairs of dresses,
not like the ones you sent last time

885
01:30:07,714 --> 01:30:11,548
The salwar, the kameez,
the veil, everything was haywire

886
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:17,723
Now l know why men find woman
poisonous after marriage

887
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:25,298
Well, the things you send,
why do they look so old?

888
01:30:25,866 --> 01:30:28,494
Hello? Hello?

889
01:30:29,936 --> 01:30:30,903
Disconnected

890
01:30:42,082 --> 01:30:43,879
What's up? You're back early tonight?

891
01:30:44,050 --> 01:30:47,508
Yes. We're going out for dinner.
Get ready

892
01:30:48,288 --> 01:30:50,848
And where's Neha?
- She's coming late tonight

893
01:30:51,291 --> 01:30:54,021
She's at her friend Rukhsana's
birthday party

894
01:30:54,227 --> 01:30:58,527
Never mind. She'll meet him later.
You meet him tonight

895
01:30:58,732 --> 01:31:02,532
Who am l meeting?
Won't you tell me?

896
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:07,529
l've seen a boy for Neha.
Nice boy

897
01:31:08,308 --> 01:31:09,536
What?

898
01:31:11,077 --> 01:31:13,045
What's the matter?

899
01:31:14,047 --> 01:31:15,878
Why are you worried?

900
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:20,083
Nothing. We need to
discuss something

901
01:31:21,121 --> 01:31:22,918
What is it?

902
01:31:23,924 --> 01:31:27,655
Neha is in love

903
01:31:28,528 --> 01:31:29,495
What?

904
01:31:31,698 --> 01:31:36,158
lt's true. He's very talented
and honest

905
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:40,003
Did you judge him?
Or did Neha?

906
01:31:42,542 --> 01:31:43,668
Neha did

907
01:31:44,711 --> 01:31:46,508
Your girl is smart

908
01:31:48,014 --> 01:31:50,005
She loves him dearly

909
01:31:50,617 --> 01:31:53,677
She is an ignorant kid,
but you are wise

910
01:31:54,754 --> 01:31:58,190
Look Reena, we've raised our daughter
with great love

911
01:31:59,893 --> 01:32:04,887
And l want her husband to shower
happiness on her more than we did

912
01:32:05,632 --> 01:32:07,190
Only then we'll be happy

913
01:32:07,567 --> 01:32:10,900
Tell her that, you'd better
understand it

914
01:32:13,907 --> 01:32:15,875
Neha will marry
only the boy l choose

915
01:32:16,743 --> 01:32:18,711
Go on, get ready, quick

916
01:32:30,190 --> 01:32:34,490
He talks a lot about you.
- Thank you. lt's a pleasure for me,

917
01:32:35,061 --> 01:32:38,030
you folks found me worthy
of having dinner with you

918
01:32:38,531 --> 01:32:40,499
And that too, at a special place

919
01:32:41,534 --> 01:32:43,502
Dinner is just an excuse

920
01:32:44,537 --> 01:32:47,995
Actually, l wanted to discuss
something important and special that...

921
01:32:48,608 --> 01:32:50,599
this place is apt

922
01:32:51,878 --> 01:32:52,845
lmportant?

923
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,007
Yes. Regarding you

924
01:32:56,683 --> 01:32:58,514
l don't understand

925
01:32:58,818 --> 01:33:02,686
Actually, my business has expanded
so much that...

926
01:33:03,823 --> 01:33:08,021
my shoulders can't take the burden

927
01:33:08,561 --> 01:33:11,689
l want you to share the burden,

928
01:33:12,732 --> 01:33:14,700
by being a partner to me

929
01:33:15,568 --> 01:33:17,695
You are taking a big decision,
for the sake of a complete stranger

930
01:33:21,308 --> 01:33:23,037
l'm not related...

931
01:33:24,244 --> 01:33:26,041
l want you to be related to me,

932
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:28,911
as my son-in-law

933
01:33:29,983 --> 01:33:31,041
Well...?

934
01:33:36,256 --> 01:33:38,724
What's the matter?
You look worried

935
01:33:39,659 --> 01:33:41,559
No, nothing

936
01:33:45,665 --> 01:33:47,633
Are you in love...?

937
01:33:48,802 --> 01:33:52,568
Actually, we love each other

938
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:00,112
We've dreamt of spending
our lives together

939
01:34:01,181 --> 01:34:04,582
Look Rahul, all your dreams
can come true

940
01:34:07,954 --> 01:34:12,755
Not with that girl,
but by marrying my daughter

941
01:34:13,860 --> 01:34:15,760
Sir, l can't shatter her dreams

942
01:34:16,429 --> 01:34:18,260
Even at the cost of yours?

943
01:34:21,835 --> 01:34:24,030
Man falls and rises many times
in life

944
01:34:25,238 --> 01:34:27,206
But he finds true love
only once

945
01:34:31,978 --> 01:34:34,606
Which mean you are willing to give up
anything for that girl?

946
01:34:38,118 --> 01:34:40,552
The company that wants
to make you the boss?

947
01:34:42,856 --> 01:34:45,916
The wealth, the luxury,
cars, bungalows, everything?

948
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:51,558
l'd even abandon the world for her

949
01:35:13,286 --> 01:35:15,254
Neha...
- Are you back?

950
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:21,750
Where does Rahul work?
- Never had a chance to ask

951
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:25,530
What happened?

952
01:35:25,765 --> 01:35:29,030
What else? Mr Kapoor was quoting
his price for my love

953
01:35:30,737 --> 01:35:32,705
He was making me his partner

954
01:35:34,174 --> 01:35:36,142
The condition was
to marry his daughter

955
01:35:37,644 --> 01:35:39,544
So what did you say?

956
01:35:43,850 --> 01:35:45,545
l refused

957
01:35:45,885 --> 01:35:46,874
What...?

958
01:35:47,887 --> 01:35:52,221
For the sake of love,
he spurned everything?

959
01:35:52,959 --> 01:35:55,553
l'll quit the house tomorrow morning

960
01:35:56,262 --> 01:35:58,230
Car?
- And the car too

961
01:36:00,733 --> 01:36:04,032
Where do you find such men
in these times?

962
01:36:06,406 --> 01:36:08,374
l wish you had fallen in love
with him

963
01:36:13,079 --> 01:36:17,914
They say, man hammers his own foot,
but you've hammered your own destiny

964
01:36:18,151 --> 01:36:20,915
You want me to marry
Mr Kapoor's daughter?

965
01:36:22,655 --> 01:36:24,520
That's exactly what l want

966
01:36:25,892 --> 01:36:27,621
And Neha? What'll she think?

967
01:36:27,794 --> 01:36:31,855
She'll understand and get over it.
At least your dreams will come true

968
01:36:32,866 --> 01:36:37,530
You are insane. l love Neha,
and you want me to marry someone else?

969
01:36:37,770 --> 01:36:41,035
Forget your philosophy. This is
how big men are made these days

970
01:36:41,307 --> 01:36:44,037
l don't want to make it big.
- Then how will you make it big?

971
01:36:47,614 --> 01:36:50,879
l'll set up my business again.
And this time,

972
01:36:51,084 --> 01:36:55,043
no Kapoor will ever dare to
quote his price for my love

973
01:36:55,788 --> 01:36:57,688
l can't drop Neha at any cost

974
01:37:07,267 --> 01:37:08,894
Rahul, know Mr Kapoor...?

975
01:37:09,135 --> 01:37:10,898
What Mr Kapoor?

976
01:37:11,804 --> 01:37:15,570
Nothing. Rahul, l love you

977
01:37:15,775 --> 01:37:17,572
lt's okay

978
01:37:19,345 --> 01:37:22,906
What? What are you saying?
ls Rahul the same boy?

979
01:37:23,116 --> 01:37:26,017
Yes mama. l couldn't
believe my ears

980
01:37:26,819 --> 01:37:28,844
l felt his love overwhelming mine

981
01:37:29,889 --> 01:37:33,188
Did you tell him you are
Mr Kapoor's daughter?

982
01:37:33,693 --> 01:37:35,661
No mama, l stopped myself

983
01:37:36,062 --> 01:37:37,029
Why?

984
01:37:38,231 --> 01:37:42,895
Rahul is a man with self-respect.
l feared, he might take a wrong step

985
01:37:44,237 --> 01:37:47,035
My child, you must delay such things

986
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,200
Don't worry mama, even daddy
has approved of him

987
01:37:50,743 --> 01:37:55,043
Just imagine how exciting it'll be
when l'll introduce Rahul to daddy

988
01:37:55,582 --> 01:37:57,550
The two of them will be stunned

989
01:37:57,684 --> 01:38:01,552
Are you crazy? l'm going to
tell your father the truth

990
01:38:01,754 --> 01:38:04,552
Not now, mama.
- Why not?

991
01:38:04,824 --> 01:38:09,727
Rahul is very agitated now.
An untoward incident might hurt his ego

992
01:38:10,964 --> 01:38:13,558
Rahul belongs to me,
and he will, always

993
01:38:14,834 --> 01:38:17,735
He has sacrificed so much
for my sake

994
01:38:18,905 --> 01:38:21,066
He can't leave me

995
01:38:23,876 --> 01:38:25,503
The road is closed

996
01:38:30,550 --> 01:38:32,575
lf one road is closed,
ten others open up

997
01:38:33,219 --> 01:38:34,186
Meaning?

998
01:38:40,059 --> 01:38:42,027
l'm setting up my business tomorrow

999
01:39:05,318 --> 01:39:07,548
l'm convinced by the feasibility
of your project

1000
01:39:07,987 --> 01:39:11,548
Our team has studied it,
and it approves

1001
01:39:11,991 --> 01:39:13,219
Thank you, sir

1002
01:39:13,393 --> 01:39:17,887
The loan amount is very high.
ln how many years will you repay it?

1003
01:39:19,666 --> 01:39:21,566
Five years, at the most

1004
01:39:22,201 --> 01:39:25,500
All right. We trust your capabilities

1005
01:39:26,339 --> 01:39:30,867
You've successfully completed projects
for others, and this is your own

1006
01:39:31,811 --> 01:39:35,008
l'll approve this loan today itself.
All the best

1007
01:39:36,282 --> 01:39:38,512
Thank you very much, sir.

1031
01:43:04,557 --> 01:43:06,525
Who?
- Rahul Khanna

1032
01:43:06,726 --> 01:43:09,024
What...? Rahul Khanna?

1033
01:43:13,032 --> 01:43:17,526
Sir, l have everything that a person
would look for in his son-in-law

1034
01:43:18,571 --> 01:43:20,869
Money, fame, respect

1035
01:43:22,241 --> 01:43:25,870
But l also have something greater.
Love

1036
01:43:27,613 --> 01:43:29,547
l love your daughter

1037
01:43:30,950 --> 01:43:33,544
And l've come to seek
your daughter's hand in marriage

1038
01:43:35,254 --> 01:43:37,722
Please don't refuse me

1039
01:43:38,591 --> 01:43:41,924
Because your daughter's happiness
lies in your consent

1040
01:43:44,130 --> 01:43:45,563
Well done

1041
01:43:45,765 --> 01:43:48,563
Will you be able to say that
before my dad?

1042
01:43:49,335 --> 01:43:51,565
Lovers aren't scared of anyone,
you must've heard

1043
01:43:52,271 --> 01:43:55,240
That's like it. C'mon,
l've told daddy everything

1044
01:43:55,641 --> 01:43:57,609
Everything? What did he say?

1045
01:43:58,144 --> 01:44:00,237
He said, he'll first take a look

1046
01:44:03,149 --> 01:44:05,117
l'm not that bad to watch, am l ?

1047
01:44:05,952 --> 01:44:08,580
Not that bad.
- Stop kidding

1048
01:44:10,156 --> 01:44:14,092
Tell me... is your dad
very dangerous-looking?

1049
01:44:14,827 --> 01:44:17,762
You will be stunned if you see him

1050
01:44:30,776 --> 01:44:32,710
What are you watching? C'mon

1051
01:44:33,746 --> 01:44:36,044
You are sweating already.
- lt's hot

1052
01:44:36,716 --> 01:44:39,708
l hope he is not hot-tempered?
- No,

1053
01:44:39,919 --> 01:44:41,887
But when he is angry...
- Then?

1054
01:44:42,588 --> 01:44:44,146
He takes his gun out.
- l'll be right back

1055
01:44:44,323 --> 01:44:46,223
Where to?
- To buy a gun

1056
01:44:46,392 --> 01:44:48,724
You can manage a huge business, but
you can't maintain your own composure

1057
01:44:48,995 --> 01:44:52,556
Why are you scared?
- No way. You are with me. Aren't you?

1058
01:44:52,765 --> 01:44:55,893
Of course, l'm with you.
- Just stand before me, he won't shoot

1059
01:44:56,102 --> 01:44:58,070
Let's go.
- Not that way

1060
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:00,033
This way.
- Let's go

1061
01:45:01,273 --> 01:45:03,741
A bar. Your father is a drunkard?
- Quiet

1062
01:45:14,854 --> 01:45:16,583
Sir, it's you !

1063
01:45:17,023 --> 01:45:17,990
You?

1064
01:45:22,061 --> 01:45:24,188
You are Neha's...?
- Sir, you are her...?

1065
01:45:26,565 --> 01:45:28,533
Hello, ma'am.
- Hello

1066
01:45:31,037 --> 01:45:34,529
The two of you make it obvious
that you knew him before

1067
01:45:35,675 --> 01:45:38,701
Not when you introduced me
to Rahul

1068
01:45:39,578 --> 01:45:42,046
But when Neha found out the truth,
she told me

1069
01:45:44,283 --> 01:45:45,807
Why wasn't l told?

1070
01:45:45,985 --> 01:45:48,215
Daddy, Rahul wanted to achieve it
on his own

1071
01:45:48,587 --> 01:45:52,887
So l forbid mama. l wanted to give
you a surprise after Rahul made it

1072
01:45:53,592 --> 01:45:55,287
Why didn't you tell me?

1073
01:45:57,263 --> 01:46:01,563
What made you imagine that
l'd be happy with your surprise?

1074
01:46:06,605 --> 01:46:08,937
l had proposed it before Rahul once

1075
01:46:10,142 --> 01:46:12,736
He refused me, insulted me

1076
01:46:16,315 --> 01:46:19,375
And the person who insults me,

1077
01:46:20,619 --> 01:46:24,521
let alone my son-in-law,
he can't even be my watchman

1078
01:46:24,924 --> 01:46:26,858
What are you saying?
- Shut up

1079
01:46:27,059 --> 01:46:28,526
Daddy please, l love Rahul.
- Get out

1080
01:46:28,728 --> 01:46:30,696
l can't live without him.
- Get out

1081
01:46:31,097 --> 01:46:33,065
Daddy, please...
- Shut up

1082
01:46:33,566 --> 01:46:35,864
Didn't you hear me? Get out!
- Rahul, wait

1083
01:46:36,068 --> 01:46:38,036
Daddy, please...

1084
01:46:38,237 --> 01:46:39,204
Wait

1085
01:46:48,948 --> 01:46:51,542
l'm your father. What say?

1086
01:46:55,588 --> 01:47:00,719
lf you can play it on me,
can't l act as much before you?

1087
01:47:05,598 --> 01:47:06,565
Rahul,

1088
01:47:08,267 --> 01:47:10,235
when you refused me,

1089
01:47:11,270 --> 01:47:15,730
l wasn't angry with you,
nor did l take it as an insult

1090
01:47:16,809 --> 01:47:20,575
ln fact, you had risen in esteem
in my eyes

1091
01:47:21,781 --> 01:47:24,511
Just one thought came to my mind,

1092
01:47:25,251 --> 01:47:30,188
l wish my daughter had fallen
in love with you

1093
01:47:34,293 --> 01:47:35,521
Rahul,

1094
01:47:37,029 --> 01:47:39,862
men like you are born once in ages

1095
01:47:40,766 --> 01:47:42,700
God bless you, my son

1096
01:47:46,672 --> 01:47:48,697
l love you, daddy.
- Love you, my child

1097
01:47:51,677 --> 01:47:55,204
''The prince is coming...''

1098
01:47:55,581 --> 01:47:57,208
''to marry''

1099
01:47:57,583 --> 01:48:01,041
''l shall dance...''

1100
01:48:01,587 --> 01:48:04,556
''in gay abandon''

1101
01:48:04,924 --> 01:48:06,892
''Play the drum''

1102
01:48:07,126 --> 01:48:09,060
''Let's dance''

1103
01:48:09,595 --> 01:48:11,563
''Call the bride''

1104
01:48:11,764 --> 01:48:13,732
''Sing and dance''

1105
01:48:17,903 --> 01:48:19,165
Welcome

1106
01:48:19,371 --> 01:48:20,895
Congratulations

1107
01:48:21,874 --> 01:48:23,068
Congratulations

1108
01:48:27,546 --> 01:48:30,037
Welcome. Your Papa didn't come?

1109
01:48:39,225 --> 01:48:41,193
You looked very worried

1110
01:48:41,627 --> 01:48:44,596
The priest is taking a long time.
Can't he prepone the rituals?

1111
01:48:45,231 --> 01:48:49,031
What's the hurry?
- The grooms are always in a hurry

1112
01:48:49,368 --> 01:48:52,030
Nothing of that sort.
The guests must be hungry

1113
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:54,536
Let them eat and go home,
they have been out since morning

1114
01:48:55,608 --> 01:48:58,543
That's just an excuse.
We know everything

1115
01:49:02,181 --> 01:49:04,046
l'll be back

1116
01:49:08,320 --> 01:49:10,220
What are you doing?
You are incorrigible

1117
01:49:10,589 --> 01:49:13,888
As if l'm robbing them
and sending them to Lahore

1118
01:49:14,093 --> 01:49:17,551
What else are you doing?
- Shabana called and told me...

1119
01:49:17,763 --> 01:49:21,563
to check all the gifts
and tell her

1120
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:25,167
You could've done that at home.
- After the wedding,

1121
01:49:25,537 --> 01:49:29,166
your wife might not even let me in.
Even if she lets me in,

1122
01:49:29,541 --> 01:49:32,169
she might not let me touch the gifts.
Everything changes after the wedding

1123
01:49:33,012 --> 01:49:36,504
Know what? Shabana was skinny
before marriage

1124
01:49:37,583 --> 01:49:40,017
Move it, or l'll call up Shabana.
- No

1125
01:49:40,219 --> 01:49:42,187
Shabana! Don't come here

1126
01:49:44,790 --> 01:49:48,021
Neha, we thought you were innocent,
but you turned out to be quite smart

1127
01:49:48,294 --> 01:49:50,524
Why do you say that?
- Because you're doing a love-marriage

1128
01:49:50,729 --> 01:49:52,697
You didn't even let us know

1129
01:49:53,565 --> 01:49:55,692
Nice choice, Neha.
- Thank you

1130
01:49:55,901 --> 01:49:57,198
Smart, eh

1131
01:50:12,584 --> 01:50:14,142
Salaam Aleikom.
- Waleikom Salaam

1132
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:15,878
ls this Rahul's house?
- Yes

1133
01:50:16,088 --> 01:50:19,546
Crime lnvestigation, Dubai.
And this is my identity

1134
01:50:19,892 --> 01:50:22,554
Officer Mohammed Al Ahmadi.
We need to search the house

1135
01:50:23,028 --> 01:50:24,928
Why?
- Court orders

1136
01:50:25,197 --> 01:50:28,166
Here's the search warrant.
- Come in, please

1137
01:50:31,804 --> 01:50:33,567
Split

1138
01:50:35,541 --> 01:50:37,509
Welcome.
- Congratulations

1139
01:50:38,277 --> 01:50:40,040
Hello Mr Uday. How are you?

1140
01:50:46,986 --> 01:50:48,954
Search the sofa, quick

1141
01:51:12,311 --> 01:51:14,211
The ritual is over

1142
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,978
lt's time to take the marital vows.
Summon the bride

1143
01:51:17,916 --> 01:51:20,043
Fetch her.
- Rightaway, priest

1144
01:51:30,596 --> 01:51:32,496
Found something?
- No

1145
01:51:40,572 --> 01:51:43,507
Neha, it's time for the marital vows.
The priest wants you

1146
01:52:51,076 --> 01:52:52,043
Mr Rahul

1147
01:53:05,290 --> 01:53:06,257
Me...?

1148
01:53:07,326 --> 01:53:09,021
You are under arrest

1149
01:53:16,735 --> 01:53:18,532
What are you saying?
One minute

1150
01:53:20,906 --> 01:53:22,874
What's the matter?

1151
01:53:27,246 --> 01:53:28,713
What are they saying?

1152
01:53:28,914 --> 01:53:32,714
On searching your house,
we found drugs

1153
01:53:33,585 --> 01:53:35,553
Drugs? What are you saying?

1154
01:53:37,256 --> 01:53:41,556
What are you saying?
- Rahul is a decent gentleman

1155
01:53:42,127 --> 01:53:45,221
He's a reputed businessman,
why'd he do that?

1156
01:53:46,098 --> 01:53:49,067
When a person becomes successful,
enemies crop up

1157
01:53:49,735 --> 01:53:54,069
lt must be his enemy.
- The court will decide that

1158
01:53:54,873 --> 01:53:57,569
As of now, let us perform our duty

1159
01:53:58,010 --> 01:53:59,978
lnspector, my wedding...
- Arrest him

1160
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:05,580
Please...
- No, l won't let you take him away

1161
01:54:05,751 --> 01:54:08,584
Neha, back off.
- l won't let you go, Rahul

1162
01:54:11,623 --> 01:54:15,115
Rahul, stop

1163
01:54:16,895 --> 01:54:18,590
Daddy, do something

1164
01:54:18,797 --> 01:54:20,594
Mama, please do something

1165
01:54:23,735 --> 01:54:25,532
What happened, dear?

1166
01:54:29,308 --> 01:54:31,208
Please excuse me

1167
01:54:31,743 --> 01:54:33,040
Excuse me

1168
01:54:34,580 --> 01:54:38,038
What's all this? l had come to
congratulate you on your wedding

1169
01:54:38,283 --> 01:54:41,218
But the entourage seems to go back.
Summed up so soon?

1170
01:54:41,587 --> 01:54:44,556
l'm sorry, officer.
He's my dearest friend

1171
01:54:44,756 --> 01:54:47,554
lf you allow me,
can l talk personally to him?

1172
01:54:48,794 --> 01:54:51,558
Sure. Mr Rahul, take your time

1173
01:54:54,099 --> 01:54:56,067
How are you?

1174
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:02,864
Rahul,

1175
01:55:03,609 --> 01:55:04,576
Yes?

1176
01:55:04,910 --> 01:55:07,572
The shit that you threw on my face,

1177
01:55:09,348 --> 01:55:11,179
l washed it off

1178
01:55:13,619 --> 01:55:17,578
But now, l tarnish your image

1179
01:55:19,625 --> 01:55:21,593
You can't wash it off. Never

1180
01:55:25,931 --> 01:55:30,698
Anyway, my best wishes for the
wedding that was your destiny,

1181
01:55:32,638 --> 01:55:34,538
but that l didn't let happen

1182
01:55:35,240 --> 01:55:40,610
l knew, only a two-penny worth man
can stoop so low

1183
01:55:53,592 --> 01:55:55,560
''My heart is restless, ''

1184
01:55:55,927 --> 01:55:57,895
''my goal is far away, ''

1185
01:55:59,097 --> 01:56:01,065
''you are my only hope, my love''

1186
01:56:02,768 --> 01:56:05,066
''Where do l go?''

1187
01:56:05,404 --> 01:56:07,235
''l'm entirely...''

1188
01:56:07,606 --> 01:56:10,575
''covered in sorrow, my love''

1189
01:56:12,144 --> 01:56:14,578
''How do l go...''

1190
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:16,577
''near my goal?''

1191
01:56:17,115 --> 01:56:20,084
''l'm in a tight spot, my love''

1192
01:56:22,954 --> 01:56:26,515
Daddy, please save Rahul.
He's innocent

1193
01:56:26,892 --> 01:56:31,022
He has done nothing, daddy.
- l know, dear. He can never do that

1194
01:56:31,563 --> 01:56:34,691
lt must be his enemies.
- But he has no enemies, daddy

1195
01:56:35,267 --> 01:56:38,202
He's an angel.
- No dearth of devils in this world

1196
01:56:39,104 --> 01:56:43,040
Mama, do something.
l can't live without Rahul

1197
01:56:43,842 --> 01:56:47,869
Don't weep, my child.
- Have patience, dear

1198
01:56:48,780 --> 01:56:53,046
l'm also worried about Rahul.
l've hired the best lawyer in Dubai

1199
01:56:53,585 --> 01:56:56,554
Have faith in God.
Everything will be all right

1200
01:57:03,328 --> 01:57:05,558
The court has given its verdict
in the case of Rahul Khanna,

1201
01:57:05,764 --> 01:57:09,063
arrested recently in a drug case

1202
01:57:09,601 --> 01:57:13,230
After hearing the testimonies as well
as arguments of the respective lawyers,

1203
01:57:13,605 --> 01:57:16,073
the court concluded that, bank loans
and hardwork were alone responsible...

1204
01:57:16,274 --> 01:57:18,242
for his sudden meteoric rise

1205
01:57:18,410 --> 01:57:20,571
And drugs had nothing to do
with his success

1206
01:57:20,846 --> 01:57:24,509
No malpractice was found
in his businesses

1207
01:57:24,716 --> 01:57:27,184
The drugs found in his house
was a fact

1208
01:57:27,552 --> 01:57:31,010
But he hasn't been able to prove
who planted the drugs inside his house

1209
01:57:32,090 --> 01:57:35,059
After listening to arguments by the
prosecution and defense lawyers,

1210
01:57:35,293 --> 01:57:39,024
the court decided that Rahul Khanna's
empire was built through bank loans,

1211
01:57:39,231 --> 01:57:43,531
and his meteoric success is due to
hardwork and corporate loans

1212
01:57:44,002 --> 01:57:49,872
Showing leniency to Rahul Khanna, the
court decided against strict punishment

1213
01:57:50,108 --> 01:57:54,545
The court also declared that since
he has to repay bank loans,

1214
01:57:54,846 --> 01:57:59,545
he will have to sell his personal as
well as business assets to repay them,

1215
01:57:59,751 --> 01:58:03,050
and return to lndia

1216
01:58:13,165 --> 01:58:17,067
''Rahul Khanna convicted
and deported to lndia''

1217
01:58:17,836 --> 01:58:20,066
No. No one can set me
and Rahul apart

1218
01:58:21,606 --> 01:58:24,507
Come to your senses.
Rahul is bankrupt

1219
01:58:24,676 --> 01:58:28,043
l fell in love with Rahul
when he was just an ordinary man

1220
01:58:28,547 --> 01:58:30,674
He was a decent gentleman then

1221
01:58:31,116 --> 01:58:34,517
But now, he's been labelled
a criminal,

1222
01:58:35,053 --> 01:58:37,021
stamped as drug peddler

1223
01:58:37,589 --> 01:58:39,853
Whoever he is,
he belongs to me

1224
01:58:40,659 --> 01:58:43,025
Don't be crazy.
Before he reaches lndia,

1225
01:58:43,895 --> 01:58:47,854
the media will spread the news
like fire ''Dubai Don is arriving''

1226
01:58:48,967 --> 01:58:50,935
Who all will you face?

1227
01:58:51,336 --> 01:58:53,861
All those fingers pointed at him
will also be pointed at you

1228
01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:56,207
Even at your children in future

1229
01:58:56,808 --> 01:59:00,608
What about their future? They will be
called the children of a druglord

1230
01:59:01,079 --> 01:59:04,879
He is right, dear.
Forget Rahul

1231
01:59:05,650 --> 01:59:09,552
He's not your destiny.
- When did you turn my enemy?

1232
01:59:11,156 --> 01:59:15,718
lf you can't wish me luck,
at least don't curse me

1233
01:59:27,105 --> 01:59:28,834
l'm leaving

1234
01:59:29,541 --> 01:59:32,999
Where to?
- Back home. Lahore

1235
01:59:34,212 --> 01:59:38,012
Why?
- Now that you have deserted me,

1236
01:59:39,050 --> 01:59:41,018
no fun living in Dubai.
Who do l fight with?

1237
01:59:41,720 --> 01:59:47,522
Who do l quarrel with?

1238
01:59:48,827 --> 01:59:52,024
Don't be crazy, Anwar.
You have responsibilities

1239
01:59:55,100 --> 01:59:59,537
l've got what was destined.
Why are you ruining your future?

1240
02:00:00,572 --> 02:00:02,039
l will return

1241
02:00:03,174 --> 02:00:04,141
Certainly

1242
02:00:04,576 --> 02:00:08,034
But, only when you return
from lndia...

1243
02:00:08,313 --> 02:00:11,544
and when your name will be
on everyone's lips once again

1244
02:00:14,653 --> 02:00:16,553
What's in my name now?

1245
02:00:17,589 --> 02:00:20,057
l'm infamous

1246
02:00:21,159 --> 02:00:23,992
No Rahul. Have you seen the sun?

1247
02:00:25,830 --> 02:00:28,663
lt emerges from behind the clouds
to shine again

1248
02:00:30,802 --> 02:00:34,863
l can see that shimmer
in your eyes

1249
02:00:37,075 --> 02:00:39,009
Your name will rise again

1250
02:00:41,279 --> 02:00:43,008
God be with you

1251
02:00:47,085 --> 02:00:48,052
Good evening

1252
02:00:48,219 --> 02:00:50,016
This way, sir

1253
02:01:02,100 --> 02:01:06,867
Excuse me, that's my seat.
- You can occupy mine

1254
02:01:17,148 --> 02:01:18,547
Neha, you?

1255
02:01:19,217 --> 02:01:21,048
l go wherever you go

1256
02:01:21,987 --> 02:01:23,818
But how come you are here?

1257
02:01:24,122 --> 02:01:26,488
Once, you gave up everything for me

1258
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:29,825
And today, l've given up
everything for you

1259
02:01:30,161 --> 02:01:33,494
And your parents?
- They had to give in before my love

1260
02:01:37,268 --> 02:01:38,496
Think again

1261
02:01:39,337 --> 02:01:42,500
l've lost money, honour,
everything

1262
02:01:43,041 --> 02:01:46,499
l've thought it over and over.
But l'm stuck right there

1263
02:01:47,312 --> 02:01:49,507
l go wherever you go

1264
02:01:54,219 --> 02:01:57,518
Hello? Yes? Okay

1265
02:02:00,592 --> 02:02:02,526
Excuse me, sir

1266
02:02:29,154 --> 02:02:32,988
As you all know, the court has
ordered businessman Rahul Khanna...

1267
02:02:33,191 --> 02:02:38,151
to leave the country.
He had just boarded the plane,

1268
02:02:38,563 --> 02:02:42,499
when destiny played another game
on him. We bring you...

1269
02:02:42,701 --> 02:02:44,999
these moments of his life.
live from Dubai airport

1270
02:02:46,204 --> 02:02:49,002
How do you feel now?
- One who has lost everything,

1271
02:02:49,708 --> 02:02:53,007
honour, money, everything...
why ask him that question?

1272
02:02:53,745 --> 02:02:55,679
Aren't you happy?
- Happy for what?

1273
02:02:56,715 --> 02:02:59,013
Happy for being ruined? For being
destroyed? Or for being devastated?

1274
02:03:00,552 --> 02:03:03,020
Today, Rahul Khanna is Dubai's
latest millionaire

1275
02:03:03,288 --> 02:03:06,018
He has won a duty free lottery
worth 50 million

1276
02:03:09,594 --> 02:03:13,030
You must be mistaken.
l never...

1277
02:03:13,665 --> 02:03:15,530
Results of the Dubai Duty Free
Air Lottery are out

1278
02:03:15,734 --> 02:03:21,536
Rahul Khanna, who had boarded an lndia
to receive it himself

1279
02:03:24,609 --> 02:03:29,546
But l never bought a lottery.
- Anwar bought a lottery, remember?

1280
02:03:30,148 --> 02:03:31,547
Perhaps...?

1281
02:03:34,586 --> 02:03:35,553
Anwar

1282
02:03:36,321 --> 02:03:38,084
Aren't you happy?
