1
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:20,872
Banerjee, it's raining!
- Hurry Pandey, it's raining!

2
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,737
It's so much fun.

3
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,537
That's what you call timing!

4
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:28,410
First of all, it's Friday evening
and we have two holidays ahead.

5
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,674
We're going for a picnic,
and it's pouring now.

6
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:34,082
Hats off to you, Rain!
- Great.

7
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,018
Well said, buddy.
- It's fun. - It's fun.

8
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:43,085
We're going to have a ball.
- He's coming.

9
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,493
Who?
- It's him.

10
00:02:44,797 --> 00:02:45,821
What is going on?

11
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,090
Finished all your work?

12
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:51,570
Mr. Deshpande. Where
is the weekly report?

13
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,830
Well sir.. - I gave you
some instructions today.

14
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,773
You had to prepare
the report by four.

15
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:00,774
I am sorry, sir.

16
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,438
Head office of Kolkata
faxed me twice.

17
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,982
What do I answer them?

18
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:06,847
Sir, the report is almost ready,
I'll have it sent over.

19
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,443
Relax. Relax.
- I am going to report it..

20
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:10,455
..to the authorities.
- Mr. Subramanium.

21
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,457
Mr. Batliwala, this is
totally outrageous.

22
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:14,527
I know. - I don't know what
the hell is going on.

23
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,926
Pandya.. where are you going?
- The weekly report..

24
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,465
To hell with the weekly report.
What about the booze?

25
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,661
I've bought it. 25 bottles of
Rum. - 25! That's wonderful

26
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,933
Shut up. Just 25? Make it 50

27
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,800
Do you want to bathe in liquor?

28
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,537
Just do as you are told. - Fine.

29
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,873
Absolutely disgusting.

30
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,072
Lousy shirkers, all! - Right.

31
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:40,619
Right, what? They take home 1 0000,
enjoy various perks..

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,551
..but forget to do their duties.

33
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:45,146
You are absolutely right,
boss. Absolutely right.

34
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,694
But what can be done? You
know the young generation.

35
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:51,561
Jokes are part of their
lives. What say?

36
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,029
Nothing doing, Mr. Batliwala.

37
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,966
There are also people here
who work sincerely.

38
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:58,628
Now look at that young
man, Mr. Raj Dixit.

39
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:04,507
Hurry up, Mr. Raj.
Look at the time.. it's 5:1 1 .

40
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,638
If you miss the 5:30
bus, you're dead.

41
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,706
Pandya, don't forget
to invite Saxena.

42
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:13,985
Mr. Sharma? Oh! Mr. Sharma!

43
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,577
Mr. Sharma! Where's the
Petty cash voucher?

44
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,522
Mr. Sharma! Voucher?

45
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,585
Orisis! In such romantic weather,
he cares for vouchers!

46
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,717
It's on the table.

47
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,193
I'm going to make knockout punches!

48
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,129
One drink will floor everyone.

49
00:04:29,235 --> 00:04:33,137
Hang on.. Deshpande, have
you organized company?

50
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,209
Oompany? - Oh no, he
means the side dish.

51
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,676
I see. Accompaniment? It's done.

52
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,544
Don't worry about that.

53
00:04:45,985 --> 00:04:48,545
Looks like the cashbook has tallied.
- Yes, madam.

54
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,749
Raj's cashbook always tallies
at one go. - Lucky guy.

55
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:56,954
There has to be some disoipline
in this office.

56
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,558
Sir.
- Yes.

57
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,758
Today's cashbook. Please sign it.
- Oh good.

58
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,565
Raj, Mr. Deshpande needs
a little help.

59
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,573
The weekly report is not
ready yet. If you could..

60
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,634
Sir, I'll do it tomorrow morning.
I have to take the 5:30 bus.

61
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:16,579
You know that.
- I know. I know. You can go.

62
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,182
Hey, Rahul..

63
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:33,128
It's.. six. - Yes, I know.

64
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,927
Brother isn't here yet.
- He'll be here, son..

65
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:41,666
He'll be..
- No. - He'll be here, son..

66
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,677
The bus which leaves at 5:35
hasn't arrived yet, it's six now.

67
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,611
You can't say anything about it.

68
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,683
Brother!
- Rahul! Where are you going?

69
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,212
Rahul, your brother will
be here any moment.

70
00:05:56,322 --> 00:05:59,883
Don't do this, you're a
grown up now. - No!

71
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:05,692
I want my brother!
- Hit me. Brother!

72
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:08,758
You thrash me everyday.

73
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:12,160
I won't come to you. Never.

74
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:20,646
I won't come to you.
- Sorry.

75
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:27,779
You say sorry everyday, and then..
- I won't do it again.

76
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:46,731
Oome on! Bandya, come on, hit it!

77
00:06:48,975 --> 00:06:50,272
Hi! My dear Raja.

78
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:56,808
Suman, please.. I'm already late.
Rahul must be waiting.

79
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:01,148
I see. And I wait for you everyday.
What about that?

80
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,812
Tell me.. tell me.

81
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:12,696
Suman. - Wow! I'm lucky today.
Someone gave me a smile.

82
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,231
Suman Please. - All right.
Your smile saves you today

83
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:21,840
Harmless as you are, at least try
to wear a smile on your face

84
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:27,368
Forget my luck!

85
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,708
Rahul.

86
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:31,907
Rahul.

87
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,178
He's just gone to sleep.

88
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,315
Rahul, good evening.

89
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,400
Hit me.. go on. A careless man
like me ought to be thrashed.

90
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:56,873
Hit me more. I'm just not worried
about my kid brother.

91
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,740
I'm always too busy
to care about him..

92
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,746
..and he's forever waiting for me.

93
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,807
Is work more important than
a brother, Shankar?

94
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm grown up but I'm still a fool.

95
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,015
I'm grown up but I'm still a fool.

96
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,859
''It's written in the lines
of destiny on my palms..''

97
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:02,867
''You and I are bound together
by our hearts''

98
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:08,407
''It's written in the lines
of destiny on my palms..''

99
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:13,081
''You and I are bound together
by our hearts''

100
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,946
''Every time my heart beats,
this is what it says..''

101
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:24,489
''May you and I forever be together.''

102
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:29,500
''May you and I forever be together.''

103
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:33,834
''It's written in the lines
of destiny on my palms..''

104
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:39,443
''You and I are bound together
by our hearts.''

105
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:10,534
''You mean the world to me,
you are my very own..''

106
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:14,945
''What have I, except you?''

107
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:25,888
''You mean the world to me,
you are my very own..

108
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,951
..what have I, except you?''

109
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:36,098
''You mean the life to me,
you are my dream..''

110
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:40,366
''To you, I would give
away all my love.''

111
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:46,035
''Be it day, or night..''

112
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:51,105
''This is all my heart has to say,
every time it beats..

113
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:56,581
..may you and I be together
for all times to come.''

114
00:10:56,689 --> 00:11:01,456
''May you and I be together
for all times to come.''

115
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,928
''It's written in the lines
of destiny on my palms..''

116
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:12,136
''You and I are bound together
by our hearts.''

117
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,600
Amazing!

118
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,014
No trace of murder, suicide or
rape in the newspapers today!

119
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,006
What good is buying a newspaper?

120
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:26,608
Here..

121
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,212
Man brandishes knife and robs
woman in broad daylight.

122
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,015
Very good.

123
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,551
Sachin Tendulkar scores
his 21st century.

124
00:11:36,662 --> 00:11:39,961
Wow! But India all out for 1 34!

125
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:43,229
I'm sick of reading the same
news over and over again!

126
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,359
Hey.

127
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:48,966
Good evening, Mr. Gupta.
- So you're here, Aunt Janki?

128
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,098
Where did the sun rise from today?

129
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:56,448
Are you in your senses?
Or did you hit the bottle, early?

130
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,449
You call your wife your aunt?

131
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,987
Wives who behave like
wives are wives!

132
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,520
You get that..
- Tell me one thing.

133
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:09,050
What have you found me lacking
in? What am I lacking in?

134
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,062
Senseless! - Senseless?! Yes.

135
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:15,059
Had I been dumb,
the ladies' club..

136
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:16,327
..wouldn't have elected me chairman!

137
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:19,996
Men are called chairmen!
- I know, I know

138
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:25,066
You're English is strong.
But are you going to lick it?

139
00:12:25,444 --> 00:12:29,073
Oan you deliver a speech in the
presence of a few people? No, no!

140
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:33,015
People in the area know me more
than they know you. Understand?

141
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:36,350
So nobody in the area knows
me? - Yes, they do..

142
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:38,548
but they know you as
Janki's husband. ;

143
00:12:38,657 --> 00:12:46,029
You know how to spell husband?
- Sure, I do. It's.. hasb.. b..

144
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,100
I don't have time for
such useless things.

145
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,497
I want to set the cooker.

146
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,093
Oooker? You mean we're eating
rice and lentils again?

147
00:12:52,738 --> 00:12:55,502
Today's a Friday. I thought
you'd bring home some fish!

148
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:00,102
Don't you know? I have a meeting
of the ladies' club on Fridays?

149
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:02,703
To hell with your meetings! You
aren't going to the club anymore!

150
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:06,114
No.. my foot!
- Now look, Janki..

151
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:07,378
Hi, mom. Hi, dad.

152
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:10,714
Here comes the Prince
of the Gupta family!

153
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:14,126
And where's the daughter?
Has she eloped before her marriage.

154
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:17,059
What rubbish you're talking!
Rotten talk.

155
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:19,194
The poor girl is visiting a friend.

156
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:22,665
Great! The Mother's at the club,
the daughter's at her friend's..

157
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,065
..the son loafs around
at the square..

158
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,138
..and the father eats
rice and lentils!

159
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,540
Rice and lentils? I'm not
eating dinner tonight.

160
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,666
I'm going to watch a movie.

161
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:32,471
Which movie? Which one?

162
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:33,738
I'm going to watch an English movie.

163
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,074
Which one. Which one.

164
00:13:35,181 --> 00:13:40,209
Watch your manners!
- Dad, you humiliate me sometimes

165
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,685
What have I done?
- Your pyjama strings are hanging.

166
00:13:43,455 --> 00:13:45,423
So your..
- This is fashion.

167
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:48,220
Yours is fashion and mine
is a pyjama-string.. fool!

168
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,090
Who'll argue with you? I'm leaving.

169
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,221
Wait.. you want money?

170
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:57,496
Have lots of fun! - Thanks, mom.
Spoil the kids! Go on!

171
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,764
What's in the box?
- It's not for you.

172
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:02,233
Have you ever got something for me?

173
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,174
Is there anything left out there?

174
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,109
Go on. Make rice and lentils.
'Nothing for me' she says.

175
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:12,651
Here comes the princess!
- What's in the box, dad?

176
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:15,242
Hydrogen bomb. You want
it? Go on inside!

177
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:24,789
Mom, Is dad going senile?
- You think so too, right?

178
00:14:25,231 --> 00:14:25,598
There was a storm.
There rose huge waves in the sea.

179
00:14:25,598 --> 00:14:28,658
There was a storm.
There rose huge waves in the sea.

180
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,796
Sindbad's ship began to sink.
But Sindbad wasn't afraid.

181
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:37,205
He plunged into the sea and
swam to the shores. Isn't it

182
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,608
Wow! Fritters! Looks like
I've come at the right time!

183
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,808
I was about to call you over.
- Smells very good.

184
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,283
Here, start eating.
- No, let me show Rahul..

185
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,286
..what I've got for him.

186
00:14:49,655 --> 00:14:52,215
Have patience.. just
wait. - What?

187
00:14:52,324 --> 00:14:56,488
I've got something that
will leave you stunned.

188
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,756
To hell with Sindbad's ship.

189
00:14:58,864 --> 00:15:02,766
Here's the real aircraft..
a Jumbo jet!

190
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:06,167
Now see what this Jumbo jet does.

191
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:10,231
Our Jumbo jet is ready for take-off!

192
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:19,181
Did you like it, Rahul?
- Thank you.

193
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,852
Mr. Gupta, why do you get such
expensive gifts for Rahul?

194
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:24,252
Where do I have to pay
any money for it?

195
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,516
People give it to me themselves.

196
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:26,852
I'm a Shop Inspector, after all.

197
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,327
When they don't feel bad in giving
it, why must I to take it?

198
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,331
Right. Have some fritters.
- You're an amazing guy, Raj.

199
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,193
Why? - You make all arrangements..

200
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:40,204
..before you leave for the
office every morning..

201
00:15:40,306 --> 00:15:42,866
..you also cook on your return.
How do you manage it all?

202
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,810
A necessity is the mother
of invention, Mr. Gupta.

203
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,805
Well said! Nice to hear.

204
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:50,211
That I didn't understand,
is another thing!

205
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,812
Rahul.. where are you going?

206
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,290
Rahul! You're going
around with wet hair!

207
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:08,298
Wait there.
- Brother..

208
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,904
Now you look like a hero.
Oome and have your milk now.

209
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,310
Here you are. Look at the
things strewn around!

210
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,378
You're still wetting the bed!
How long will you continue..

211
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,922
You're such a big boy!
And you laugh? Fool!

212
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,452
Brother..
- Let me go, I'm late already

213
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,924
Its 9 already. And Shankar
hasn't turned up either.

214
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:46,795
There he is.

215
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:50,935
Shankar.. - Do I look like
Shankar? - No, well..

216
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,346
Whenever I come face to face
with you, why do you sulk?

217
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,279
No.. that's not true at all.

218
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,476
I'm standing at the door.
Won't you invite me in?

219
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,614
Oome on in. - I'd have
entered in any case.

220
00:17:03,989 --> 00:17:07,425
I'm in a bit of a hurry. - So?
You want me to go away?

221
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:09,956
No.. Shankar hasn't arrived either.

222
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:15,295
But I'm here, right? Tell
me what needs to be done.

223
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,702
I could lay down my life for you.

224
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:19,361
No, it isn't anything like that.

225
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:22,907
But I have something.
For you to do. - What?

226
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,637
Don't worry. I'll tell you
when the time comes.

227
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,712
For now, I've got pancakes
for you. Eat them up.

228
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:36,381
I made them on my own. - Really?

229
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:39,451
What does ''really"' mean?
I can't make them on my own?

230
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:43,386
No, that's not what I meant.
- I can do everything.

231
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,798
Take care of the house,
look after the children..

232
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,795
I can even sew your shirt.

233
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,472
Eat the pancakes. - Well, later..

234
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,407
Eat them up in my presence.
- I'm already late.

235
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,479
I'll feed you.. Go on.
Open your mouth.

236
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:05,407
Sorry, I couldn't get into a bus..

237
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:06,609
You've come right on time.

238
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,413
You had to show up only
now, you baldy?

239
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,754
And what are you laughing for?
I'll give you one stinging slap!

240
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,953
Shut up! You and your brother
are just like each other!

241
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:19,758
Let me know this evening how
you found the pancakes.

242
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,360
On popular demand,
we now play a song from the film..

243
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:27,905
''Tera Mera Saath Rahe.''

244
00:18:28,006 --> 00:18:30,440
The song has been written
by Anand Raj Anand.

245
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:33,841
The song has been rendered by
Sukhwinder and Hema Sardesai.

246
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,769
''Assert your right.''

247
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:42,437
''Assert your right to my love,
hold me in an embrace, my love.''

248
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:44,974
''Assert your right.''

249
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,712
''Assert your right to my love,
hold me in an embrace, my love.''

250
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,516
''This monsoon, my body's on fire.''

251
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,524
''For how long shall
I thirst for you?''

252
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,459
''Let go of my hand,
get out of my path.''

253
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,590
''Your love is nothing but madness.''

254
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,533
''Let go of my hand,
get out of my path.''

255
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:06,729
''Your love is nothing but madness.''

256
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:12,538
''Why do I feel that this has
the making of a legend?''

257
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:48,637
''I'm in a daze. I don't know
what has come over me.''

258
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:56,977
''It's ages since this time
of our union has arrived.''

259
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:03,784
''Forsake your loneliness,
hold me tight in embrace..''

260
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:08,923
''Let me take off the veil of
modesty, just keep hugging me.''

261
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,002
''Hold me tight in embrace..''

262
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:19,209
''If you have made up your mind,
you must do what you've decided.''

263
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:21,677
''This monsoon, my body's on fire..''

264
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,011
''For how long shall
I thirst for you?''

265
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:29,545
''Let go of my hand,
get out of my path.''

266
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,953
''Your love is nothing but madness.''

267
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,753
''Let go of my hand,
get out of my path.''

268
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,158
''Your love is nothing but madness.''

269
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:42,632
''Why do I feel that this has
the making of a legend?''

270
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:04,979
May I take the pancakes
away?

271
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,717
Nothing.. those pancakes?

272
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:22,730
Look at Mrs. Shah! How she looks
the touch-me-not types today!

273
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,146
How she looked during
our picnic! Oh no!

274
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:31,007
What does that mean?
- She was in a mini skirt.

275
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:34,686
But she's the one
I'm still dreaming about!

276
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:36,681
Good afternoon. Be seated.

277
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,756
Everything alright? Be seated.

278
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:41,023
Hello, sir!
- How are you Raj? - Fine, sir!

279
00:22:42,394 --> 00:22:44,954
What brings you here, sir?
- I had some work with you.

280
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:47,759
Me? What? - I'll tell you.

281
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,891
How are you? - Fine sir.

282
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,026
And Rahul? - Fine. Good.

283
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:56,233
Mr. Khanna, seeing you, it does
not seem you are a retired man.

284
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,306
You are healthier than before.

285
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:03,637
I do double the work at home than
what I used to do in office.

286
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:05,777
Mr. Sharma, you are laughing a lot.

287
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,648
I heard you had a blast in Khandala.

288
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:10,187
You guys had 50 bottles of rum.

289
00:23:11,757 --> 00:23:15,124
Sir, how do you know?
- The news came in the papers.

290
00:23:16,094 --> 00:23:17,118
Oome on, sir!

291
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,863
Will you have tea,
sir? - No, later.

292
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:21,660
Oome out with me.

293
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,734
All the best to you, guys.
- Bye, sir.

294
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:27,864
He's gem of a person.

295
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,798
The old man looks young even now.

296
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,801
Young? He's calling him old man.

297
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,812
You should have called me over.
- No, my coming was necessary.

298
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,144
Sit down.
- But sir.. - Sit down.

299
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:47,152
Actually, Raj,
I have a niece, Madhuri.

300
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,819
She is my sister's daughter.
Very beautiful.

301
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,820
She's good natured too.
She lived in Delhi.

302
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:56,162
She has been living with me
in Bombay since a month.

303
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,826
She works as a copywriter
in an ad agency.

304
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:01,705
Proposing her for someone?
- Yes.. you.

305
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,776
Me? But sir, you know
I don't want to get married.

306
00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:11,110
I know. Yet I want you
to meet Madhuri once.

307
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:15,253
Sir, I respect you very
much. But marriage..

308
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,787
The question is not whether you
want to get married or not.

309
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:23,860
For my sake, just meet her once.
- But sir, marriage..

310
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,190
No excuse, Please!

311
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,128
Give rupees 201 . - Only rupees 11 .

312
00:24:27,232 --> 00:24:32,397
Hey no! Robert!
Look, he is giving only rupees 1 1 .

313
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:34,267
How much do you want?
- Don't take less from him.

314
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:38,399
Bring his belongings if he doesn't
give. I'll take money from Gupta.

315
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,738
Oome on, give me 201 !

316
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:42,871
Mr. Gupta, how much
do I write? - Rupees 201 .

317
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:45,872
What dad! Pay rupees 501 ,
it's a question of my honour.

318
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,750
Fool! Have you ever honored your
father. Your honour indeed!

319
00:24:49,855 --> 00:24:52,415
What happened? I have been hearing
noises since so long.

320
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:54,822
Nothing aunt, we were
talking of donation.

321
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,759
How much do you want?
- Rupees 501 only.

322
00:24:57,863 --> 00:25:00,764
Then write it. Will you pay?

323
00:25:00,866 --> 00:25:02,834
As if I want to die that
I'll refuse. Write.

324
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,096
Take the money in the evening.
- Thank you.

325
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:10,299
Three cheers for aunt Janki.
Hip, hip, hurray. - Hip, hip hurray.

326
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:11,432
Hip, hip hurray.

327
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:15,104
Strange! I am giving money and
they are cheering aunt Janki?

328
00:25:16,281 --> 00:25:17,373
Jealous!

329
00:25:17,482 --> 00:25:18,779
You burn, burn.

330
00:25:19,084 --> 00:25:22,315
Really Janki, if you
had not married me..

331
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,911
..you'd be a professor of English.

332
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,857
You will also.. you will also..

333
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:36,263
I got rupees 151 from
the booth. - Great!

334
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,392
And you? - Rupees 501 .

335
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,395
Swami, make your father
pay rupees 201 .

336
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:43,804
He would give if I had passed.
I flunked in my exams.

337
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:47,470
My father will pay.
I got a new sister, the fourth one.

338
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,003
Fourth one.

339
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,344
Ask your father to stop now.
How much population will he increase?

340
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,478
Robert, let's take from Patwardhan.

341
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,487
Has he ever paid more
than rupees 1 .25?

342
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:58,954
You come on. Let's not bother.
- Oome on! For the heck of it.

343
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,151
Just for time pass.

344
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:06,888
Anna.
- Who is it? - What is it, ha?

345
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,434
Who is it? Is this the time
to knock on someone's door?

346
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:14,503
No. - I was sleeping. - Anna,
we are collecting donations.

347
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,973
What for? - Independence day.

348
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,906
We have been celebrating
it since 25 years.

349
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:23,370
Alright, write rupees 1 .25.
- Didn't I tell you!

350
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:28,248
Anna, give rupees 201 .
- Rupees 201 ?

351
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,843
Do you know to even write 201 ?

352
00:26:29,955 --> 00:26:30,979
What man?
- What?

353
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,989
If you want take rupees 1 .25,
or leave.

354
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,854
Forget it, the old man is a miser.

355
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,984
What did he say!

356
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:43,125
I'll tell you. He said
that the old man is a miser.

357
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,127
Your father is a miser!

358
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,467
Your whole lousy family is
a miser! Shameless fools!

359
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,007
Just come here! - Hey miser.

360
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,538
Your father, Pascal D'Souza,
he is a miser.

361
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,946
Since I'm old, you're troubling me.

362
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,072
What are they doing?

363
00:26:58,316 --> 00:26:59,544
Mr. Gupta, why don't
you tell the kids?

364
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:02,415
I am old but I still
have the strength.

365
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,215
Is this what your parents
have taught you?

366
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,291
You don't work, just loiter around.

367
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,088
I am a miser? Your
father is a miser.

368
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,560
Your family is full of thieves.

369
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:15,164
He calls me a miser.
- Anna, calm down.

370
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,425
Oalm down? I should calm down?

371
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:22,371
You are telling me?
Tell these loafers.

372
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:29,312
Anna.. Anna.. calm down.

373
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:36,979
What do I do to anybody?
I quietly live in my room.

374
00:27:37,355 --> 00:27:39,118
Have I ever troubled anybody?

375
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:43,054
I just get a pension of rupees 500.

376
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:45,595
How I run the whole month,
only I know.

377
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,195
I have never gone begging to anyone.

378
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,074
I had a son.. he left..

379
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,005
..with his wife
after getting married.

380
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:05,074
He lives in her home now.

381
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,484
Whether his father is alive
or dead, he doesn't care.

382
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:10,611
He doesn't care.

383
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,352
We are there for you.

384
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,961
I don't need anyone.
Leave me alone.

385
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,091
I want to live alone!

386
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,164
Raj, Anna is turning
hysteric by the day.

387
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,975
Old age is very bad.

388
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:36,174
And worst than that is
being alone in old age.

389
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,975
You are right. That is
why people like us..

390
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,986
..tolerate our good for
nothing children..

391
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:45,113
..hoping them to be our
support in old age.

392
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:49,183
Oome. - No, I am going out.

393
00:28:49,294 --> 00:28:50,386
And Rahul?

394
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,587
Shankar is there.
You also keep an eye.

395
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,062
Sure, you don't have to say that.

396
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:59,066
Madhuri. Ohild Madhuri.
- Ooming.

397
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,005
Madhuri, he..

398
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:14,407
Raj. Raj.

399
00:29:15,386 --> 00:29:18,287
Yes? - She is my niece, Madhuri.

400
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:22,226
Madhuri, he is Raj. Raj Dixit.

401
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:30,029
Oome, sit down. - Yes, come,
Very good. Sit here.

402
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,100
Get up. Oome. - Why?

403
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:39,369
Just come. - But..

404
00:29:39,477 --> 00:29:41,308
Use your brains sometimes. Oome.

405
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,376
Stay, sir. - No Raj.

406
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:47,508
Two is company and three is crowd.

407
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,588
And four is a.. fourth gear.

408
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,128
We'll hear the joke outside. Oome.

409
00:29:58,696 --> 00:30:00,061
You two sit and chat.

410
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:05,065
It's so funny.

411
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:09,263
Uncle is strange sometimes.

412
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:16,211
Why? - He left two
strangers alone.

413
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:22,083
To tell you the truth,
you are not a stranger for me.

414
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,278
Sir has told me a lot about you.

415
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,750
He must have praised me.

416
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:32,425
Uncle has a bad habit.
- What habit?

417
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,430
He likes everyone.

418
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,159
Everyone should have
such a bad habit.

419
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:39,759
You are uncle's stooge.

420
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:44,505
Actually, he has not said
anything wrong about you.

421
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,103
Or a man, who doesn't
talk to anyone..

422
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,443
..is talking so openly with you.

423
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,518
You don't like to talk?
- It's not that.

424
00:30:55,286 --> 00:30:57,720
I have to like the person
I am talking to.

425
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,593
Have you come here
looking for a job?

426
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,260
No, I have come looking for life.

427
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:16,269
I want to bury distasteful memories
in the crowds of Bombay.

428
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,333
I don't understand.

429
00:31:21,246 --> 00:31:22,270
Uncle didn't tell you?

430
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,616
No. What had happened?

431
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,683
My marriage had been fixed in Delhi.

432
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,218
But it broke on the marriage day.

433
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:34,423
What? Why?

434
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,830
Because that morning,
my to-be mother-in-law expired.

435
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,432
The boy's family was educated.

436
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,301
But I was held responsible
for this tragedy.

437
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,642
I don't regret that
the marriage broke.

438
00:31:57,882 --> 00:32:00,248
It is good I didn't get
married to such a boy.

439
00:32:01,953 --> 00:32:04,183
But it became difficult to
live in Delhi after that.

440
00:32:04,956 --> 00:32:07,186
Some with sympathy,
some with taunts..

441
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:10,261
..people never let me
forget the episode.

442
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:15,266
I left Delhi and came here.

443
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,467
I'm sorry
- Why?

444
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,275
You were in a good mood,
I ruined it.

445
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,810
No, it's nothing like that.

446
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:34,218
In fact, listening to you,
I even forgot Rahul for some time.

447
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:39,754
Sorry.. Rahul is the name
of my younger brother.

448
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:44,292
I know everything about
Rahul. Uncle told me.

449
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,763
I really respect you for that.

450
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:54,431
Rahul is totally dependent on me.
He loves me very much.

451
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,304
Even I won't be able
to live without him.

452
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:04,312
That is why.. that is why,
I will never marry.

453
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,252
It is not that I didn't like you.

454
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:12,382
Actually, after many days,
I've spoken so openly to someone.

455
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:17,388
Please don't misunderstand me, miss.

456
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:20,254
Don't be so formal.

457
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:23,256
Oall me by name.

458
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,327
Okay.

459
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,734
Forget about marriage.
We can be friends at least?

460
00:33:35,446 --> 00:33:36,470
Will you be my friend?

461
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,347
Promise.
- Oheers.

462
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,353
Raj, you look very happy
today. What is it?

463
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:59,435
Is it necessary to have
a reason to be happy?

464
00:34:00,338 --> 00:34:02,898
It is the first time you
suggested we have drinks.

465
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:06,966
Oh yes, before I forget,
I will pay for the liquor today.

466
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,443
As if I buy the liquor.

467
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,642
I just stand outside a liquor
shop and get a bottle.

468
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:13,512
Absolutely free of cost.

469
00:34:13,618 --> 00:34:15,984
That's the benefit of
being a shop inspector.

470
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,987
Anyway, tell me, why are
you so happy today?

471
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:34,797
Gupta, I found a new friend today.

472
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,000
You should've brought him here.
- That friend doesn't drink.

473
00:34:38,109 --> 00:34:40,407
Why did you make friends
with such a person?

474
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,415
I just did it.
- She's a girl, right?

475
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,607
How do you know?

476
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:52,950
You won't believe me today,
but when I met Janki the first time..

477
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:55,355
..even I had the same expressions
on my face.

478
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,893
It's nothing like that,
we are just friends.

479
00:34:56,994 --> 00:34:58,689
I have already told her
I'm not going to marry.

480
00:34:58,796 --> 00:35:00,024
Did you have to tell her that?

481
00:35:01,065 --> 00:35:02,430
There should be no
misunderstandings later.

482
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,563
At least you agreed to make friends.
Even that's okay.

483
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,898
Tell me more.

484
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:12,966
What do I say about her?
She is very nice.

485
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,972
She is not only beautiful,
she is innocent too.

486
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,781
She speaks her mind.

487
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,450
I met her the first time,
but felt I knew her since years.

488
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:30,718
Bits.

489
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:37,461
What happened to Suman?

490
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:40,069
Forget it. Must have had
a tiff with Janki.

491
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:42,463
What is her name?

492
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:44,798
I asked what your friend's name is.

493
00:35:47,512 --> 00:35:47,879
Madhuri.

494
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:48,538
Madhuri.

495
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,072
This is Barfiwala mansion.

496
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:52,879
How much? - Rupees 22.

497
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:56,082
Ok!
- Take this.

498
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:03,820
Why did you drop such
an easy catch?

499
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:08,699
Why did you stop?
- What happened?

500
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:14,029
Do we have a shoot in our
society? - Are you mad?

501
00:36:14,539 --> 00:36:15,836
Why will we have a shoot
in our society?

502
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:20,706
Look at that girl.
- She's beautiful!

503
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,170
She is coming here.
- Excuse me.

504
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,706
Me?

505
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:27,909
Where does Raj Dixit live?

506
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:32,183
No Raj Dixit lives here.

507
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:36,193
Wait! Raj Dixit? - Yes.

508
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:38,661
The one who works for
Oriental Shipping?

509
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,993
Yes. - The one who wear glasses?
- Yes.

510
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:46,001
Raj! He lives here. Over there.

511
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:49,071
Here. - Here. - Tell him.
- There. - He lives there.

512
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:53,734
Brother.

513
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:56,873
Listen! Music.

514
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:58,209
Dance, dance.

515
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:03,210
I'll open it.

516
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,756
Hello Raj.
- You've hit jackpot.

517
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,553
Someone has come to meet you. Yes.

518
00:37:13,664 --> 00:37:17,623
Oome. Why out, friend?
Oome in. come in.

519
00:37:17,868 --> 00:37:22,100
Oome. - Here, here come.
Get a chair. How are you?

520
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:29,978
Hey! Get up. - What happened?
- Get out, go I said.

521
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:33,250
Leave.. leave! Get out!
- Brother Raju!

522
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,110
They barge into anyone's home.

523
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,779
No manners, man! No problem.
- Hey! You go out.

524
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,259
Sit here. No problem.
- Out! Leave!

525
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:50,267
You suddenly came..
you could have told me.

526
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:54,738
It's.. it's ok, Raj.
Raj, don't worry. It is ok.

527
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:57,740
I had taken leave for
two days from office.

528
00:37:58,309 --> 00:37:59,674
That's why everything is going
at a leisurely pace.

529
00:38:00,578 --> 00:38:02,808
I know. - You called up office?

530
00:38:03,848 --> 00:38:05,748
Twice. Yesterday and today.

531
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:11,281
You didn't go to office today?
- I left home for office.

532
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:14,822
I thought I'll meet Rahul
on my way.

533
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:19,286
Where is Rahul?

534
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:21,622
Rahul.

535
00:38:32,877 --> 00:38:37,974
Hey, why did you hide?
Scared of me?

536
00:38:39,283 --> 00:38:40,648
Am I so fearful?

537
00:38:42,219 --> 00:38:43,311
You don't know me?

538
00:38:45,222 --> 00:38:47,122
But I know you very well.

539
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:53,194
Your name is Rahul. Isn't it?

540
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:58,335
One more thing. You love planes.

541
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:00,994
Jumbo jets.

542
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,015
Jumbo jets.

543
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,747
Jumbo jets.
- Jumbo jets.

544
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,091
You like jumbo jet very much.
Right?

545
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:24,952
Wow.

546
00:39:25,129 --> 00:39:26,357
Shall I sing you a
song of jumbo jets?

547
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,230
'Jumbo jets.'

548
00:39:34,271 --> 00:39:36,967
'Jumbo jets.'

549
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:41,371
'Get in quickly,
the journey will be great.'

550
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,042
'High mountains somewhere,
and deep valleys somewhere.'

551
00:39:50,287 --> 00:39:51,311
Rahul is very sweet.

552
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:53,390
You made friends
with him in minutes.

553
00:39:54,759 --> 00:39:56,056
Not me, he did.

554
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,659
You are comfortable with anyone.

555
00:40:02,032 --> 00:40:05,399
Not anyone,
only those whom I like.

556
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,079
Hey Raj.
- Suman.

557
00:40:16,781 --> 00:40:19,147
Who was she? - Who?

558
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:23,082
Don't pretend. The boys have
told me everything. - 'Mom.'

559
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,221
Who was that heroine who
came in the morning?

560
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:29,291
Who? Madhuri? She is a friend.
- Oan't you make friends with me?

561
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,962
It's not that, Madhuri.. Suman.

562
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,725
You and your Madhuri!
Don't act very smart.

563
00:40:36,133 --> 00:40:38,431
What do you think?
I am crazy about you?

564
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:40,430
You brought home a heroine
to make me jealous.

565
00:40:40,805 --> 00:40:42,432
Look, mom..
- Suman. - Get lost.

566
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:45,708
Hundreds hover around me,
understand? - Oome.

567
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,103
I'm coming. What does
he have anyway?

568
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:50,370
Is he all that handsome?
- Oome!

569
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:54,178
Leave me, mom!
I won't even look at you now.

570
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,776
Okay don't look at him. Now
come home. - Idiot!

571
00:40:57,154 --> 00:40:59,315
Our relationship is over! - Okay!

572
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,459
Forever! Why did you
stand up? Sit down!

573
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,988
You come inside now.
- He thinks he is very handsome.

574
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,405
Hello.
- Hello, may I speak to Raj Dixit.

575
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:19,340
Raj? Hold on. Raj, your call.

576
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:25,280
Hello. - Hi Raj, Madhuri
here. - Yes Madhuri?

577
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,815
He may not leave you?

578
00:41:27,184 --> 00:41:31,883
Mr. Ponkshe, Raj has got
a call from a girl.

579
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:34,224
A girl? That's not possible.

580
00:41:34,391 --> 00:41:38,760
I heard her voice.
- Is it? - Yes. - Yes.

581
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,489
But why are you feeling shy?
- Why should I feel shy?

582
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,834
Strange! Raj has got a girl's call.

583
00:41:46,136 --> 00:41:48,502
Yes, a girl.

584
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:49,965
But isn't it surprising?

585
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,506
Raj has got a call from a
girl for the first time.

586
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,506
What is the problem, Nisha?
- Not a problem, there's news.

587
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,373
News? Oongratulations.
- Not that news.

588
00:41:58,549 --> 00:41:59,914
Alright Madhuri,
I'll call you tomorrow.

589
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:05,178
What happened?

590
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,324
Where is the engagement
ring? - Engagement..

591
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:15,057
So this scene is
for this phone call?

592
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,925
I didn't expect this from
you, Raj. - Meaning?

593
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:22,270
Who was this girl?
- Mr. Khanna's niece.

594
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:25,838
She wanted to give some message
of his. - That's all?

595
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,069
Of course. If I get engaged, won't
I throw a party in a 5 star hotel?

596
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,339
Oh no! You have really
disappointed us.

597
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:34,542
Is that Mr. Subramanium?

598
00:42:45,462 --> 00:42:46,554
Rahul, what happened?

599
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,964
Hey, Rahul. You fell down. Oh dear.

600
00:42:50,868 --> 00:42:51,892
Rahul.

601
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:53,435
How many times have I told you
to be careful while playing?

602
00:42:54,004 --> 00:42:55,972
Where are you hurt? Where
are you hurt, son?

603
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:00,102
Rahul.. Rahul, brave
children don't cry.

604
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,235
Rahul.

605
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:05,573
Alright if you stop crying,
I'll sing the jumbo jet song for you.

606
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:07,975
Want to hear?

607
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:09,820
Where is your jumbo jet?

608
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:36,078
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

609
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:39,607
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet''

610
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,887
''Get in quickly.''

611
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,152
''The journey will be great.''

612
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,625
Air India's flight to London
is going to leave soon.

613
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,156
Please fasten your seat belts..

614
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,493
..and don't remove your
hand out of the window.

615
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:59,633
''Get in quickly,
the journey will be great.''

616
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:03,633
''High mountains somewhere,
and deep valleys somewhere.''

617
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:13,914
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

618
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:17,519
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

619
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:21,114
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

620
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:42,674
''Batman, Superman, Pilot,
see dreams with open eyes.''

621
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:46,683
''Donald Duck will bring the food.''

622
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,215
''Whoever gets it will be lucky.''

623
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,683
''Donald Duck will bring the food.''

624
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,424
''Whoever gets it will be lucky.''

625
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,427
''Look, the moon and stars.''

626
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,968
''Even they are with us.''

627
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,232
''Look, the moon and stars.''

628
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,238
''Even they are with us.''

629
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:15,570
''Be careful, the rocket is taking
off, where is your attention?''

630
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:25,978
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

631
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:29,457
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

632
00:45:31,628 --> 00:45:33,061
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

633
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:47,607
''Our speed is increasing,
there is no worry, no crowd.''

634
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:51,145
''Whoever comes in the way,
will be wiped out.''

635
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:58,143
''Our speed is increasing,
there is no worry, no crowd.''

636
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:01,755
''Whoever comes in the way,
will be wiped out.''

637
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:03,424
''Where is the jumbo jet?''

638
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,025
''This jumbo jet is so big.''

639
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:06,762
''Up down, down up.''

640
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,622
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

641
00:46:08,799 --> 00:46:10,232
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

642
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,765
''Jumbo jet. Jumbo jet.''

643
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:14,502
''Jumbo jet.''

644
00:46:17,808 --> 00:46:18,008
Rahul fell down, Raj.

645
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:19,168
Rahul fell down, Raj.

646
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,637
Doctor. That way.

647
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:29,782
Rahul! Don't cry.
Everything will be alright.

648
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,118
Nurse. Get me cotton quickly.
- Yes, doctor.

649
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,321
Brother. - Doctor, please!
Perhaps it's hurting.

650
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,123
I know. Brother.
- Doctor..

651
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,797
Please go out. - But doctor..

652
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:48,601
Please take him out.
- Gupta.- Yes. Oome Raj.

653
00:46:49,706 --> 00:46:52,334
You go out, Raj.
- You take care of him, Suman.

654
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:56,342
Everything will be fine.

655
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,681
Nurse. Oall anesthetist.
- Ok, doctor.

656
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,817
Has he eaten anything
in the last 3-4 hours?

657
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:03,080
No, doctor.
- ok

658
00:47:07,191 --> 00:47:10,683
Raj, everything will be alright.
The doctor is treating him.

659
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:12,828
Sit down.

660
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:15,831
Sit.

661
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,363
''You can go to Bombay,
Delhi or Agra.''

662
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:21,835
Bala, who is shouting since so long?

663
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,363
It's some mad child.

664
00:47:23,874 --> 00:47:25,364
He's just a little hurt,
and he is shouting so much.

665
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:26,633
Give me some tobacco.

666
00:47:27,878 --> 00:47:29,243
Should give him a tight slap.

667
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,846
Just shouting without any reason.
- No.. no.

668
00:47:35,819 --> 00:47:37,844
Tell him to take care, ok.
- Yes, doctor.

669
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:42,849
The doctor has called you.
- Go, meet him.

670
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:48,788
Excuse me.

671
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,457
Oome, Mr. Dixit.

672
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:52,459
Brother.

673
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,875
See how your brother
is smiling now.

674
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,606
And you were unnecessarily worried.

675
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:02,269
He is such a brave boy.

676
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:04,537
He didn't cry at all while
I stitched him up.

677
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:08,874
But.. but you still look worried.

678
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:13,882
What is the matter? -
I'd got a little scared.

679
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:15,755
I'm sorry.
- It's ok.

680
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:22,231
Brother.. here.. eight.
- You got eight stitches?

681
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,761
He's come.

682
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:30,431
Rahul.
- How are you feeling, Rahul?

683
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:34,637
Enough now, don't talk too much.

684
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:38,909
Oome on. - What! Stopped shouting?
Alright now?

685
00:48:40,684 --> 00:48:42,709
Who is he? - The same mad boy
who was shouting.

686
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,188
It's better not to have children
than have such children.

687
00:48:45,289 --> 00:48:46,449
Raj. - Absolutely right.

688
00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:47,714
They are a burden on earth.

689
00:48:48,292 --> 00:48:52,194
Raj. - What did you say?
- What? - What?

690
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,221
What did you call him? - Mad.

691
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:55,923
His name is Rahul. - So?

692
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,400
By naming him Rahul,
does that not make a mad child mad?

693
00:48:58,635 --> 00:48:59,795
I'll teach you a lesson today.

694
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:02,939
Hey! Have you too gone mad
along with the boy?

695
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,467
Raj, leave him.

696
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,935
Hey, what are you doing?
Raj, leave him.

697
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,806
Raj, leave him.

698
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:13,745
Raj, no! No, Raj!

699
00:49:13,850 --> 00:49:18,287
Raj, leave him. He'll die.
Raj, what are you doing?

700
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:20,616
Laxmi!

701
00:49:20,857 --> 00:49:23,951
Please, leave him sir.
Please leave him.

702
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,286
Raj, leave him, he will die.

703
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,491
Raj, leave him.

704
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,358
Let go off him!

705
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:32,965
Raj! He'll die.

706
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,830
Let go off him!

707
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:37,234
Mr. Dixit! Please behave yourself.

708
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:40,708
Please leave him alone.
- I'll not leave him. Fool!

709
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:42,369
He called my brother a mad boy.

710
00:49:42,546 --> 00:49:47,711
Please! Mr. Dixit, leave him.
I request you. Please.

711
00:49:48,285 --> 00:49:51,777
It's my request, Mr. Dixit.
Please let him go. Please, Please.

712
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:55,992
You called him mad?
- I made a mistake, doctor.

713
00:49:56,293 --> 00:49:58,261
Go and apologize to him. Go.

714
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:03,864
Mr. Dixit, I'm really very sorry.

715
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,861
Please. - I committed a mistake,
please forgive me.

716
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:08,999
Forgive.

717
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,278
You also don't talk to your
brother. My best friend fell down..

718
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:23,353
he was so badly hurt, and
he didn't even tell me?

719
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:27,352
Brother, I'm not talking to you.

720
00:50:28,058 --> 00:50:32,017
Alright, we forgive him this time,
but yet, I am angry.

721
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:34,887
Everything happened so suddenly..

722
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:39,325
Ok! Fine. How many stitches
did he get? - Eight.

723
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,338
Eight? God! Did it hurt?

724
00:50:42,606 --> 00:50:45,575
No.
- Strong boy!

725
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:49,839
When will they be removed?
- After ten days. On the 24th.

726
00:50:50,614 --> 00:50:54,050
24th? Then we'll go on
a picnic on the 25th.

727
00:51:35,659 --> 00:51:37,092
''I wonder..''

728
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,885
''How..''

729
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:46,096
''If I had not met you,
what would happen?''

730
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,397
''I wonder..''

731
00:51:52,008 --> 00:51:53,976
''How..''

732
00:51:54,811 --> 00:51:59,578
''If I had not met you,
what would happen?''

733
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,385
''I wonder..''

734
00:52:03,153 --> 00:52:05,121
''How..''

735
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:11,121
''If I had not met you,
what would happen?''

736
00:52:11,561 --> 00:52:16,521
''The peace my heart has found..''

737
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:21,662
''Would I have found it without you?''

738
00:52:22,706 --> 00:52:25,140
''Maybe..''
- ''Maybe..''

739
00:52:25,842 --> 00:52:27,935
''Yes, maybe..''

740
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,671
''Maybe..''
- ''Maybe..''

741
00:52:31,114 --> 00:52:33,139
''Yes, maybe..''

742
00:52:44,794 --> 00:52:52,166
''My love grows, I will not be able
to live without you, I swear.''

743
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:58,171
''I have never come across
anyone like you.''

744
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:04,041
''I won't let you go
away from me now.''

745
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:12,178
''It seems like this bond was
made somewhere in heaven.''

746
00:53:15,492 --> 00:53:20,191
''That this bond is for eternity.''

747
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:25,594
''Oould it be so?''

748
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:28,731
''Maybe..''
- ''Maybe..''

749
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:31,732
''Yes, maybe..''

750
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:34,739
''Maybe..''
- ''Maybe..''

751
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:37,203
''Yes, maybe..''

752
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:57,226
''I know that you know.''

753
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:03,233
''You know that I know.''

754
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:08,235
''I know that you know.''

755
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:11,103
''You know that I know.''

756
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:16,116
''We know, even if the world knows..''

757
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,984
''I wish no turmoil is created.''

758
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:27,255
''But wonder when this killing
distance will end.''

759
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:32,659
''Is it possible that we will
be able to break this wall?''

760
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,529
''Maybe..''
- ''Maybe..''

761
00:54:35,905 --> 00:54:38,271
''Yes, maybe.''

762
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,270
''Maybe..''
- ''Maybe..''

763
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:44,006
''Yes, maybe..''

764
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:19,782
Aunt has come! Applause!

765
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:24,784
Olaps! Oheers!

766
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:29,314
Waiting for me? You
should have started.

767
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:30,717
Starting.

768
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,853
How can we start like that?
You are our society's secretary.

769
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:35,322
How can we start without you?

770
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:37,993
I am extremely very sorry.

771
00:55:38,368 --> 00:55:41,064
I have become so busy.

772
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,195
I'm telling you..

773
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:45,604
I don't know whether I should
pay attention to the society..

774
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:50,339
Or the club. - If you can,
pay attention to your home.

775
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:54,341
You shut up. Jealous fellow.
Always envious of me.

776
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:58,020
My dear brothers and sisters.

777
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:02,156
My dear brothers and sisters.

778
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:05,020
Are you deciding the programme
or giving a speech?

779
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:08,364
You shut up. Don't
Interrupt.

780
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,889
Don't interrupt.

781
00:56:09,999 --> 00:56:14,902
This is the 25th year when we are
celebrating Independence day.

782
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:20,365
So on this silver anniversary,
why don't we invite Hritik?

783
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:23,244
Aunt, will you really
bring Hritik?

784
00:56:23,413 --> 00:56:25,381
I will talk with Suzanne.

785
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:29,114
Who is Suzanne? - Hritik's
wife. You foolish fellow.

786
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,777
Her aunt's daughter's sister's
mother-in-law is our club's member

787
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:36,392
Decide the programme first.
We'll think of Hritik when he comes.

788
00:56:36,693 --> 00:56:39,059
Going to talk with Suzanne.
- Aunt, shall I give a suggestion?

789
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:41,923
We'll invite the Brahmaputra
Orchestra band.

790
00:56:42,098 --> 00:56:46,194
Just a minute! I'm against
inviting an orchestra.

791
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,927
Spoke! The old man spoke.

792
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:50,402
Shut up! You boys.

793
00:56:50,774 --> 00:56:54,403
Even he has a fundamental right.
You speak, Anna.

794
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:57,737
If you want to protect
your culture..

795
00:56:57,981 --> 00:57:02,281
..we will organize a prayer meeting
on the silver anniversary.

796
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,283
Oh! God. Oh!

797
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:07,890
Its good he donated rupees 1 .25,
so he's suggesting a prayer meeting.

798
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:10,690
Had he donated another rupees 1 .25..

799
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:14,696
..the miser would ask
us to stage a show.

800
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:18,300
Your father is a miser.
- Don't mention my father!

801
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,959
If you respect your father so much
go make him sit in a temple.

802
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,300
Why a temple? I will make
him sit in a church.

803
00:57:23,473 --> 00:57:25,703
Robert, why are you arguing
With the old man?

804
00:57:26,009 --> 00:57:28,705
Your father must be old.
- Don't call my father as old.

805
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:29,972
Oh God, look they've started again.

806
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,313
Sitaram, forget it.
Aunt, we'll call an orchestra. Yes.

807
00:57:33,483 --> 00:57:36,782
I will complain to the police.
I will have you all arrested.

808
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:37,978
If you talk too much,
we will throw you down.

809
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:39,179
Enough! Are you seeing?

810
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,450
Hey! Who'll throw me down?
- You! You'll throw me down.

811
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:46,125
Hey, what are you doing?

812
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:48,198
Listen to me. Listen.

813
00:57:49,098 --> 00:57:51,760
Greetings brothers and sisters.

814
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:55,735
Awamji Barfiwala mansion is..

815
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,865
..celebrating Independence day.

816
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:03,335
Hey.. play.

817
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:10,480
So this is our society's 25th year.

818
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,225
You will have to listen.

819
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,893
Listen! Listen! Listen!

820
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:29,163
We don't want!

821
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:32,764
Shut up! Shut up! Oh God!
Let me speak.

822
00:58:32,876 --> 00:58:35,310
Janki, come off the stage.
- Let me speak.

823
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,810
Start the programme!

824
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:42,508
So brothers and sisters..

825
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,853
..we begin today's programme..

826
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:52,790
with Awamji Barfiwala..

827
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:57,390
..mansion's young star!

828
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:11,408
''I saw a road, what a road it was.''

829
00:59:11,981 --> 00:59:15,348
''On the road I saw a bungalow.''

830
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:19,218
''I saw a road, what a road it was.''

831
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:23,025
''On the road I saw a bungalow.''

832
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:27,225
''I saw a window in the bungalow,
and a girl in the window.''

833
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:28,953
''The way the girl looked at me..''

834
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:32,228
''My heart was soaked
in the rain of love.''

835
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:43,568
Hold your hearts, brothers
and sisters.

836
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:49,579
Ooming before you is Awamji
Barfiwala mansion's heroine!

837
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:56,257
Our very own, Suman!

838
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,523
''O magical lover.''

839
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:03,326
''Leave my hands.''

840
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:08,593
''It's already past midnight
let me go back home.''

841
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:18,276
''My character and status will tell
everything. Let me go back home.''

842
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,615
''You are a foreigner!''

843
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:27,947
Wonderful!

844
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:34,621
''You are a foreigner!
You will deceive me.''

845
01:00:34,998 --> 01:00:41,494
''You are a foreigner!
You will deceive me.''

846
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:48,634
''You are bound to leave
this rented room.''

847
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,580
''You are a foreigner!
You will deceive me.''

848
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:53,979
Stop this!

849
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,176
''You will deceive me.''

850
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:04,188
''You are a foreigner!
You will deceive me.''

851
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:08,922
''You are bound to leave..

852
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:13,128
..this rented room.''

853
01:01:13,636 --> 01:01:15,661
What happened to her? Suman!

854
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,135
''You will deceive me.''

855
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,341
Get down. - Leave me, dad.

856
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:28,140
He never asked me for a glass of
water. I will make it even today.

857
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,952
And the last show of today
is being presented by..

858
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:37,356
..Awamji Barfiwala mansion's
Hritik Roshan.

859
01:01:37,593 --> 01:01:40,357
A solo item!

860
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:54,700
''My heart is craving
to listen to it.''

861
01:01:55,144 --> 01:02:01,708
''Tell me you love me!
Tell me you love me!''

862
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:09,014
''Tell me you love me!
Tell me you love me!''

863
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:17,723
''There is consent in
this sweet talk.''

864
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:24,731
''Tell me you love me!
Tell me you love me!''

865
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:32,204
''Tell me you love me!
Tell me you love me!''

866
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:38,744
Rahul.

867
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:51,566
Rahul! Rahul! Rahul! Rahul!

868
01:02:51,667 --> 01:02:53,760
Rahul! Rahul!

869
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,672
Hey..

870
01:04:18,154 --> 01:04:19,382
I came to take the file.

871
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,247
Sorry! You may.

872
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,595
Hello?
- Hello?! Raj.

873
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:37,864
You thought of me early
morning today.

874
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:39,465
The situation is such.

875
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:44,669
I can't think of anything.
I am very upset. I want to meet you.

876
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,878
Okay. - Right now.

877
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:53,282
How can I come now?

878
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:57,884
Take half day off. I'll wait
outside your office at 3 p.m.

879
01:04:58,928 --> 01:05:00,418
Okay!
- Okay.

880
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:02,598
Bye.

881
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:17,905
Raj, will you say something?

882
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:24,579
Madhuri, what happened yesterday
should not have happened.

883
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:26,712
What?

884
01:05:28,824 --> 01:05:31,725
You know what I'm talking about.
You do, don't you?

885
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:35,931
Yes, but I didn't find
anything wrong in it.

886
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:41,332
In fact, I'm not at all embarrassed
to say that I love you.

887
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:42,795
Madhuri!

888
01:05:42,905 --> 01:05:45,669
Speak the truth, Raj.
You also love me, don't you?

889
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,948
I have never thought on
those lines, Madhuri.

890
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:55,945
You don't want to think about it.

891
01:05:56,652 --> 01:05:58,483
You are afraid to hear
your heart's call

892
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,951
Yes I'm afraid. But
you know my problem.

893
01:06:02,325 --> 01:06:05,351
Then find a solution.
- There is no solution, Madhuri.

894
01:06:06,662 --> 01:06:08,425
You won't find a solution running
away from the problem.

895
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:10,956
Do you have a solution?

896
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:13,559
Answer me, Madhuri.

897
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:21,274
If you think with a cool head,
and practically, there is.

898
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:22,901
What?

899
01:06:23,746 --> 01:06:26,442
Look Raj, Rahul is a big boy now.

900
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,842
For kids like Rahul..

901
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:30,851
..there are many hospitals,
rehabilitation centers.

902
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:31,977
Shut up, Madhuri.

903
01:06:33,022 --> 01:06:34,990
How did you even think of
keeping Rahul away from me?

904
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:37,857
You know Rahul is dependent on me,
he cannot live without me.

905
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,518
Yet you..
- How dare you!

906
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,332
I'm sorry, Raj.

907
01:06:53,776 --> 01:06:55,004
I didn't want to hurt you.

908
01:06:56,712 --> 01:06:59,340
I thought Rahul will
become independent.

909
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:06,013
Anyway, I am sorry.
- I am sorry too.

910
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:11,026
I got angry. I was very rude.

911
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:16,695
If you don't vent your anger on
a friend, on whom will you?

912
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,030
Will you still be my friend?

913
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:25,370
If you want it.

914
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:31,370
Thank You.

915
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:42,724
Whatever you may say, but
I didn't expect this from Madhuri.

916
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:47,321
No, Gupta, I think whatever
Madhuri said..

917
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,330
..is right, it's practical.

918
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:56,405
Is marriage just a union
of two people, Raj?

919
01:07:57,706 --> 01:07:59,936
If Madhuri really loves you..

920
01:08:00,709 --> 01:08:02,870
she should take the responsibility
of Rahul.

921
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,073
No, Gupta, Rahul is
my brother, my blood.

922
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,484
I have been seeing him
since childhood.

923
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:14,346
Maybe that's why he means
everything to me.

924
01:08:15,991 --> 01:08:17,083
But I cannot forget..

925
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,358
..that even though he may be
15 years in age..

926
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:22,397
..but mentally, he is
a kid of 2-3 years.

927
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:31,369
And I cannot expect Madhuri to
begin a new life with a kid.

928
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:34,407
And what if she agrees
to accept Rahul?

929
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:44,575
Then.. for the first time in life,
I have loved someone.

930
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:51,924
He doesn't do any work.
The useless fellow. Loafer!

931
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:54,128
Who does he think he is?

932
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:56,428
He is always standing
at the street corner.

933
01:08:56,832 --> 01:08:58,732
What is the matter, Gupta?
- What could be the matter?

934
01:08:58,901 --> 01:09:00,391
How do I know? - Then
why do you ask?

935
01:09:00,503 --> 01:09:01,527
Then why do you get annoyed?

936
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:03,137
I am stuck in this rut!

937
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,131
Even the bin in the street
is more respected than me.

938
01:09:07,710 --> 01:09:09,143
What happened, dad?
- What happened?

939
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:13,142
I will break his bones!
I will skin him alive!

940
01:09:13,516 --> 01:09:16,007
I had barely fallen asleep..

941
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:17,483
..and you started the
moment you entered.

942
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:19,816
Oh yes, madam, sleep!

943
01:09:20,055 --> 01:09:22,683
If you don't sleep, how
will your children get spoilt?

944
01:09:22,858 --> 01:09:25,691
Dad, what did Sanjay do?
- What did he do?

945
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:28,163
The shameless fellow was standing
at the street corner.

946
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,897
He had some new friends
with him today.

947
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,427
When I asked him what he was doing..

948
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:34,162
..he told me to proceed,
he'll follow.

949
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:38,169
When I left, his friends
asked him who I was.

950
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:41,165
You know what the fool said?
- What?

951
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:45,046
He said this man lives
in his society.

952
01:09:45,548 --> 01:09:47,982
So what wrong did he say?

953
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,053
Don't you live in this society?
- I'll thrash you!

954
01:09:52,955 --> 01:09:54,445
They feel ashamed to call
their father as father.

955
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,048
Hi dad!

956
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:00,185
Dad? You fool! You just wait!

957
01:10:00,496 --> 01:10:02,521
Wait a minute!
- Let me handle this.

958
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:06,729
You fool!
Did you insult my husband?

959
01:10:07,903 --> 01:10:11,202
Mom, just look at him.
How does he look?

960
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:12,864
Look at his shirt.

961
01:10:12,975 --> 01:10:14,602
The collar is torn,
he has tucked a handkerchief there.

962
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:16,745
He drops tea on his shirt while
drinking tea and doesn't realize it.

963
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:20,545
He sprays betel leaf spit
on his shirt.

964
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:25,613
Old pants, five year old slippers,
the thumb ring broken.

965
01:10:26,255 --> 01:10:30,624
He was limping and walking.
- Laugh! Laugh more!

966
01:10:30,926 --> 01:10:33,759
That is why I tell everyone
he is my grandpa.

967
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:36,961
Shut up, you brazen guys!

968
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,758
Is this how you show respect
to your father?

969
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:40,125
I will tell you something.

970
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,505
If you come to my ladies club
like this, even I will say..

971
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:45,233
..you live in my society.

972
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,929
Who.. who is it?

973
01:11:12,201 --> 01:11:13,600
Hello! How do you do?

974
01:11:13,869 --> 01:11:16,064
You? - Don't you recognise me?

975
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:18,764
Of course, I recognise you.
Oome in.

976
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:21,672
Mr. Gupta, come in.
- Thank you, Raj. Thank you.

977
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:26,673
Raj.. how do I look?

978
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,814
You look very different.
- What different?

979
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:33,012
I am handsome young man.

980
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:35,551
I'm from..

981
01:11:37,192 --> 01:11:40,218
Rahul is sleeping.

982
01:11:41,163 --> 01:11:44,030
Is aunt not at home?
- She must be home.

983
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,294
I've come to meet you.

984
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:51,296
Just look at me.
Raymond suiting shirting.

985
01:11:52,207 --> 01:11:55,973
Zodiac tie. Imported shoes.

986
01:11:56,278 --> 01:11:58,576
I'm okay.

987
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:04,578
A leather bag.
A leather bag. Goggles.

988
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:11,059
Imported Splendor goggles.

989
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:13,584
A man should be posh
looking and great..

990
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,596
..a man should be well groomed.

991
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:22,327
Will my wife and children
refuse to recognise me now?

992
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:24,262
No.

993
01:12:25,107 --> 01:12:27,598
If I don't accept bribes..

994
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:32,010
..can my wife and children
have a posh lifestyle?

995
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:37,614
What is status? Status.

996
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:43,618
I am the husband of chairwoman
of the ladies club.

997
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:47,358
I am the father of a young,
talented boy.

998
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,893
Talented, my foot!

999
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:52,830
That is what you say.. my foot.

1000
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:57,364
You know, he has flunked his
first year graduation thrice.

1001
01:12:57,673 --> 01:13:01,632
If I question him, he says
he will enter politics. Why?

1002
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:04,778
He will make lots of
money there. What do I say?

1003
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:08,644
Even I accept bribes.

1004
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,048
I'm also bad.

1005
01:13:11,687 --> 01:13:14,178
The whole system is corrupt.

1006
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:18,921
Every person, from top
to bottom is corrupt.

1007
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:25,657
Sorry.. except this one fellow.

1008
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,996
You know he's my darling.

1009
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,671
I'll take a kiss.

1010
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:32,797
My darling, I'll take a kiss.

1011
01:13:35,444 --> 01:13:36,741
Gupta, sit down.

1012
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:39,405
I'm alright. I'm alright.

1013
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:43,344
I'm alright. Alright.

1014
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,817
Oan anyone sleep a peaceful
sleep like him?

1015
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:56,354
Raj, I have not slept
for so many days.

1016
01:13:58,467 --> 01:13:59,695
Since many days.

1017
01:14:00,135 --> 01:14:02,035
I have a grown up girl.

1018
01:14:04,006 --> 01:14:09,034
Her age is increasing, but I cannot
find a proposal for her.

1019
01:14:11,013 --> 01:14:14,107
She has bad stars in her horoscope.

1020
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:17,318
Oalm down, Gupta, everything
will be alright.

1021
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:21,253
Don't give me false hopes.
Nothing gets alright.

1022
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,448
Nothing. Nothing works.

1023
01:14:23,892 --> 01:14:27,055
I have heard she goes about
with some guy from a garage.

1024
01:14:27,896 --> 01:14:29,454
The loafer.. ruffian!

1025
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,460
If I tell her anything..

1026
01:14:32,768 --> 01:14:35,464
She asks us if we'll keep
her single all her life.

1027
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:40,272
I feel very scared Raj,
very scared.

1028
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,743
I feel scared.

1029
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:54,953
Gupta.. Gupta!

1030
01:14:56,391 --> 01:14:59,292
Suman, are you going out?
- You play your game.

1031
01:15:00,295 --> 01:15:02,229
Forget it Sanjay,
don't be tensed.

1032
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,162
No tension!
We're meeting tonight, okay.

1033
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:13,773
Raj, you called me?
- Yes, I had some work with you.

1034
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:15,973
Shankar, go out. - Yes.

1035
01:15:17,145 --> 01:15:19,238
Sit down. - No, I'm fine.

1036
01:15:22,818 --> 01:15:27,778
Your father had come here last night.
- So? Should I dance?

1037
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:33,518
No. He was saying that
the garage boy, Asif..

1038
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:36,389
That I am having an affair
with him, right?

1039
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:40,059
But a garage boy? Why?
- He loves me.

1040
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:45,068
And you? - I don't
love him at all.

1041
01:15:46,441 --> 01:15:47,465
Why then?

1042
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:51,404
For the first time in life,
someone has loved me.

1043
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,077
But Suman..
- I only love you, Raj.

1044
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:58,811
Only you.. will you marry me?

1045
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:02,818
No, right?

1046
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:09,292
It is easy to give advise.
But the one who suffers..

1047
01:16:12,034 --> 01:16:16,368
I am going, Asif must
be waiting for me.

1048
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:32,377
Madhuri!

1049
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:35,323
Aunt, you? You haven't slept yet?

1050
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:40,259
I could not sleep,
thinking about you.

1051
01:16:40,495 --> 01:16:44,261
Why? - What does Raj
say? - About what?

1052
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,060
About marriage.

1053
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,405
Raj is firm on the decision
not to get married.

1054
01:16:51,006 --> 01:16:52,030
Then?

1055
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:58,408
Then what? Nothing.
I was mad to fall in love with him.

1056
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:02,074
I don't even know
if he loves me or not.

1057
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,944
Brother.. - Wait.

1058
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,147
Brother.. - I said wait!

1059
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:34,701
Hey! Idiot!

1060
01:18:36,411 --> 01:18:41,576
Here's another. Fool! Oan't you see?
They drive so rashly!

1061
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:43,583
It is difficult to walk
on the road these days.

1062
01:18:43,685 --> 01:18:46,518
And the compound is
full of children.

1063
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:49,384
Hello, uncle. - Hello.

1064
01:18:49,491 --> 01:18:50,651
You'd gone to the bazaar?
- Yes.

1065
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:51,987
To buy misery?
- You fool!

1066
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:55,461
To buy your father's.. - Robert!
Robert! Will you shut up?

1067
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,997
How dare you tease me?

1068
01:18:57,099 --> 01:19:00,262
Hey society leader! Why don't you
warn the children? - You fool.

1069
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:01,665
They are troubling Anna.

1070
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:04,004
Just come here! I'll
break your legs!

1071
01:19:04,106 --> 01:19:05,596
Hey you! What are you doing?

1072
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:07,742
Shut up! I am telling you.
- Nothing aunt.

1073
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:09,135
Anna, come up.

1074
01:19:09,244 --> 01:19:13,146
Who do they think they are?
The fools!

1075
01:19:19,354 --> 01:19:20,378
Anna!

1076
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:25,755
Sanjay, Suman, Robert, come soon.
Shekhar, go call the doctor.

1077
01:19:26,194 --> 01:19:31,564
Anna, what happened?
Lift him up. - Oareful.

1078
01:19:31,733 --> 01:19:36,170
Hey, get up! - What happened? Anna!

1079
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:40,435
Why are you shouting?
Nothing happened to Anna. - Shut up.

1080
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:45,508
Oareful. Don't crowd over him.
- Everybody move aside.

1081
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,582
The doctor has come. Move aside.

1082
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:50,517
Oome here.
- Move aside I said.

1083
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:55,647
Doctor you come here.
- And you stop crying. Keep quite.

1084
01:19:55,757 --> 01:19:57,782
Oome on this side. - Shut up.

1085
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:01,187
Doctor, sit sown. - Sit.
- Thank you.

1086
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:14,667
Who is with him?
Get this medicine urgently.

1087
01:20:14,776 --> 01:20:17,074
Sanjay, get this medicine quickly.
- Get this medicine.

1088
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:28,083
Take.

1089
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:33,692
Don't take tension,
he will regain consciousness soon.

1090
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:35,426
Don't crowd over him.
Let him get some fresh air.

1091
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:36,622
Let him get some fresh air.

1092
01:20:36,731 --> 01:20:38,756
Open your eyes, Anna.

1093
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:40,158
Hey man!

1094
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:44,099
He opened his eyes!
- Hey, how are you? - Hey.

1095
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,106
What happened?
- You fell down on the stairs..

1096
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:50,701
..due to high blood pressure.
- Move aside!

1097
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:52,643
Sanjay has come.
- Anna, recovered?

1098
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,309
Take this medicine.
- Medicine?

1099
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:57,385
The doctor has asked you
to take medicine.

1100
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,518
Doctor? - He came and left.

1101
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:02,589
He even gave you an injection.
- Injection?

1102
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,716
Don't take tension,
we have paid him.

1103
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:12,600
You did so much for me?
- Not for you, for us.

1104
01:21:15,503 --> 01:21:16,800
What do you mean?

1105
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:18,395
If anything happens to you,
who will we call a miser?

1106
01:21:18,506 --> 01:21:22,340
Hey! Sanjay.
- Shameless! Mind your tongue!

1107
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:24,602
Put a horse on your tongue
and pull him back.

1108
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,146
Her English!

1109
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:29,149
No, Janki, let them say.

1110
01:21:29,918 --> 01:21:33,149
Hereafter, if they don't call me
a miser, I won't like it..

1111
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:36,816
..I'll not be able to digest
my food. - Wonderful.

1112
01:21:36,925 --> 01:21:42,158
Anna, miser!
- Your father is a miser.

1113
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:56,841
Brother.. ball.. play.

1114
01:21:56,945 --> 01:22:00,574
You go and play.. go.

1115
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:04,809
Ball.

1116
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:06,974
''When I first met your eyes..''

1117
01:23:07,282 --> 01:23:10,581
''I felt a little scared.''

1118
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:16,254
''When I met your eyes
the second time..''

1119
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:19,984
''I felt a little shy.''

1120
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:26,527
''When you met my eyes
the third time..''

1121
01:23:26,701 --> 01:23:31,263
''That magic spell was cast,
that left me spellbound.''

1122
01:23:31,606 --> 01:23:33,005
''I found my beloved.''

1123
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:35,401
''Have I fallen in love?''

1124
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,611
''Have I fallen in love?''

1125
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:40,276
''Have I fallen in love?''

1126
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:43,007
''Have I fallen in love?''

1127
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:47,281
''When I saw you
for the first time..''

1128
01:23:53,328 --> 01:23:57,287
''When I saw you
for the second time..''

1129
01:23:57,665 --> 01:24:01,032
''I felt a little shy.''

1130
01:24:26,361 --> 01:24:29,330
''Neither was I looking for someone.''

1131
01:24:29,464 --> 01:24:31,659
''Nor had I even thought about it.''

1132
01:24:31,833 --> 01:24:36,463
''Neither was there any answer,
nor was there any question.''

1133
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:40,663
''But my heart is speaking
the truth.''

1134
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:45,808
''I never felt like this before.''

1135
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:50,351
''I never had felt
like this before.''

1136
01:24:50,485 --> 01:24:55,081
''I myself don't know..

1137
01:24:55,590 --> 01:25:00,084
..how, stealthily,
surreptitiously..''

1138
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:01,828
''The weather teased me.''

1139
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:04,089
''Have I fallen in love?''

1140
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:06,492
''Have I fallen in love?''

1141
01:25:06,734 --> 01:25:09,100
''Have I fallen in love?''

1142
01:25:09,404 --> 01:25:11,838
''Have I fallen in love?''

1143
01:25:46,174 --> 01:25:50,736
''I am in a daze, even the
autumn seems like spring.''

1144
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:55,675
''Even day seems night, what
does your company do to me?''

1145
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:59,408
''How do I tell you?''

1146
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:05,085
''My heart hides the heart's secret.''

1147
01:26:05,193 --> 01:26:09,562
''My heart hides the heart's secret.''

1148
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:14,158
''What charm has spread over me?''

1149
01:26:14,736 --> 01:26:19,435
''It adorns the lips, rings
in the breath..''

1150
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:21,097
''The music of love.''

1151
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:23,439
''Have I fallen in love?''

1152
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:25,702
''Have I fallen in love?''

1153
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:28,175
''Have I fallen in love?''

1154
01:26:28,483 --> 01:26:30,917
''Have I fallen in love?''

1155
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:35,445
''When I saw you
for the first time..''

1156
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:39,458
''I felt a little nervous.''

1157
01:26:41,129 --> 01:26:45,190
''When I saw you
for the second time..''

1158
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:48,999
''I felt a little shy.''

1159
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:55,131
''When I saw you
for the third time..''

1160
01:26:55,510 --> 01:27:00,140
''I was spellbound.
I lost control.''

1161
01:27:00,248 --> 01:27:01,806
''I have found a lover.''

1162
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:04,210
''Have you fallen in love?''

1163
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,214
''Have you fallen in love?''

1164
01:27:06,754 --> 01:27:08,949
''Have I fallen in love?''

1165
01:27:09,157 --> 01:27:11,216
''Have I fallen in love?''

1166
01:27:11,526 --> 01:27:13,756
''Have you fallen in love?''

1167
01:27:13,995 --> 01:27:15,895
''Have you fallen in love?''

1168
01:27:16,264 --> 01:27:18,630
''Have you fallen in love?''

1169
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,165
''Have you fallen in love?''

1170
01:27:29,010 --> 01:27:30,978
Rahul. Rahul..

1171
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:34,872
Rahul.

1172
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,731
Brother.. - Let go off him.

1173
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:00,868
Brother.

1174
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:11,547
Hey, what's going on?
Move! Leave him.

1175
01:28:11,653 --> 01:28:14,213
Why are you creating a ruckus?
- I have created a ruckus?

1176
01:28:14,589 --> 01:28:17,615
They were teasing my brother.
- Why did you tease the mad boy?

1177
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:21,559
Hey! Who did you call mad? You
are mad. Does he live off you?

1178
01:28:21,963 --> 01:28:27,299
I'm sorry.. hey, scram!

1179
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:40,637
Stop. - Rupees 35.

1180
01:28:42,216 --> 01:28:44,776
Hi babe! - Get lost!

1181
01:28:46,354 --> 01:28:47,582
Give my pack.

1182
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,653
Gupta, coming from office?

1183
01:28:52,927 --> 01:28:53,951
Will you go home now?

1184
01:28:55,029 --> 01:28:56,326
Oigarette? - No, I have one.

1185
01:28:57,365 --> 01:28:59,663
Take Suman also and go. - Suman?

1186
01:28:59,767 --> 01:29:02,600
Yes. Look, she is sitting there
with your to-be son-in-law.

1187
01:29:11,212 --> 01:29:13,874
Suman, you shameless girl!

1188
01:29:14,048 --> 01:29:17,279
This is what you are doing here?
Oome home! Oome home! Oome.

1189
01:29:17,385 --> 01:29:19,853
Why, you loafer.. - Hey! Who
are you calling a loafer?

1190
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:23,355
Don't shout and talk to me.
You don't scare me.

1191
01:29:23,658 --> 01:29:27,355
Oome home you shameless girl! Oome..

1192
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:30,757
I'll skin you alive! You
have brought us disgrace.

1193
01:29:30,865 --> 01:29:33,629
Get in! You have disgraced me!

1194
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:39,833
You impudent girl! Brazen!

1195
01:29:39,941 --> 01:29:41,306
What are you doing?
Have you gone mad?

1196
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:44,901
You don't interfere, Janki.
She has sullied our name.

1197
01:29:45,947 --> 01:29:47,642
See the way she is looking at me.

1198
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:51,380
I will gouge out your eyes.
I'll kill you! - Dad.

1199
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:53,984
Hey! Get out! Get out! Out!

1200
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:58,852
But what has she done,
first tell me that.

1201
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,158
She was with that loafer..
- He is not a loafer, dad.

1202
01:30:03,264 --> 01:30:06,927
Is he from a respectable family?
- What are you doing!

1203
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:08,793
You don't interfere, mom.

1204
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:12,129
Kill me. Kill me, dad!

1205
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:13,730
You dare to argue with
me, brazen girl!

1206
01:30:13,975 --> 01:30:14,999
Leave her!

1207
01:30:15,176 --> 01:30:17,406
Brazen? I am brazen?

1208
01:30:17,979 --> 01:30:19,879
You should feel ashamed, dad..

1209
01:30:20,114 --> 01:30:21,672
..that you are beating
your young daughter..

1210
01:30:21,783 --> 01:30:22,807
..like that in everyone's presence.

1211
01:30:23,718 --> 01:30:26,016
Have you ever given
a thought to my age?

1212
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:30,691
Food to eat, home to live,
clothes to wear..

1213
01:30:30,792 --> 01:30:33,886
..is that all a young girl needs?

1214
01:30:40,735 --> 01:30:45,365
If your honour is so dear
to you, get me married.

1215
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:55,242
Kill me.. kill me!

1216
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:57,174
Why did you stop?

1217
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:18,195
Milk.

1218
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:25,803
Milk.

1219
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:44,822
Suman.

1220
01:31:49,804 --> 01:31:50,828
Suman.

1221
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:56,433
Suman

1222
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:03,511
Listen.. get up.. get up!
- What happened?

1223
01:32:03,818 --> 01:32:05,843
I can't see Suman around.
- She must be in the bathroom.

1224
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:07,784
I checked in the bathroom.
She is not there.

1225
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:08,913
Let me sleep, Janki.

1226
01:32:10,558 --> 01:32:12,992
Dear mom and dad,
I am leaving home..

1227
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:17,923
Dear mom and dad,
I am leaving home.

1228
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:23,531
Don't try to find me as
I am marrying Asif.

1229
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,274
I don't like my leaving
home like that.

1230
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:32,809
But I am helpless.
I am pregnant with Asif's baby.

1231
01:32:34,382 --> 01:32:35,406
Suman.

1232
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:40,878
Suman.

1233
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:43,479
If Suman left the house,
what do I do? Raj.

1234
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:46,360
What does Gupta say
in your society..

1235
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:48,824
..why Anna's son lives
in his wife's home..

1236
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,557
..Manjit Singh's wife has cancer..

1237
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:52,423
..what have I got to do
with all that?

1238
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:55,898
Look, Suman..
- My name is Madhuri.

1239
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,240
I am Sorry. Madhuri.

1240
01:33:04,478 --> 01:33:07,504
Tell me something Raj,
why do we meet everyday?

1241
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,179
Have you ever spoken about us?

1242
01:33:12,153 --> 01:33:14,587
Have you ever accepted
that you love me?

1243
01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:20,059
What name will you give
our relationship, Raj?

1244
01:33:22,430 --> 01:33:26,992
I like meeting you, but
I am always scared..

1245
01:33:27,301 --> 01:33:28,325
..where will it finally lead to?

1246
01:33:35,309 --> 01:33:36,333
Madhuri..

1247
01:33:37,912 --> 01:33:39,539
We should not meet each other, Raj.

1248
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:45,619
I don't know about you but
it will hurt me very much.

1249
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:51,286
It will be in the interest of
the future of both of us.

1250
01:34:01,936 --> 01:34:02,960
Bye, Raj.

1251
01:34:18,686 --> 01:34:20,517
It is not good to drink so much.

1252
01:34:21,422 --> 01:34:23,253
It doesn't take long
to develop the habit.

1253
01:34:25,026 --> 01:34:27,256
Though it is no use
telling you anything.

1254
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:30,392
Raj, you only tell him.

1255
01:34:30,965 --> 01:34:33,991
No, Anna, Gupta is drinking alcohol
after many days today.

1256
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:40,537
Shankar, where is Rahul?
Sleeping? - No, he's in your house.

1257
01:34:40,708 --> 01:34:43,609
Really? - He is sitting with
aunt. Want anything else?

1258
01:34:43,978 --> 01:34:45,002
No, you may go.

1259
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,080
Rahul has become very close
to aunt these days.

1260
01:34:48,315 --> 01:34:52,411
Yes. It's good. Even
she feels better.

1261
01:34:55,256 --> 01:34:59,283
Since the day Suman has left,
she has become very quiet.

1262
01:34:59,994 --> 01:35:01,291
Suman took a very wrong step.

1263
01:35:01,996 --> 01:35:03,088
A very wrong step.

1264
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:07,460
No Kanta, you must not be
attached to anything.

1265
01:35:08,669 --> 01:35:11,502
Especially, don't have any
expectations from your children.

1266
01:35:14,208 --> 01:35:16,972
It is six years since
my son left home.

1267
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:24,712
I met him two days ago in
the bazaar with his wife.

1268
01:35:26,287 --> 01:35:28,050
He was even carrying a two
year old child in his arms.

1269
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:32,726
When I waved to him, he
didn't even look at me.

1270
01:35:36,030 --> 01:35:39,727
I came to know in the bazaar that
I have become a grandfather.

1271
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:48,065
That is why I am telling you,
don't have attachments.

1272
01:35:51,712 --> 01:35:53,270
It is very easy to say that, Anna.

1273
01:35:54,115 --> 01:35:55,412
It is very easy to say that,

1274
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:02,084
Anyway, forget that. Raj,
how is Madhuri?

1275
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:09,622
That story is over.
- I don't understand.

1276
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:16,563
I mean, she said
she doesn't want to meet me.

1277
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:19,298
Why? How could she say
that just like that?

1278
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:23,635
No, what she did was right.
- Hey.

1279
01:36:25,079 --> 01:36:29,379
Our relationship didn't
have any destination.

1280
01:36:31,685 --> 01:36:36,054
Any news on Suman?
- I met her only yesterday.

1281
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:40,554
She lives in a hutment colony
in Ohinchpokli..

1282
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:44,127
..in a 6 by 6 room.

1283
01:36:45,766 --> 01:36:47,597
There is no electricity
nor any household things.

1284
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:52,805
She was trying to light
a broken stove.

1285
01:36:59,713 --> 01:37:02,546
A girl who never stepped into
the kitchen all her life..

1286
01:37:03,450 --> 01:37:04,747
..how can she light a stove?

1287
01:37:07,655 --> 01:37:09,680
I gave her rupees 50000
today morning.

1288
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:14,093
And told her that if she wants
to buy a small house..

1289
01:37:14,195 --> 01:37:17,631
..she should let me know.
I will provide the money.

1290
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:23,496
Whatever you may say Anna,
your children are your own.

1291
01:37:25,472 --> 01:37:28,236
Anna, human relationships
are strange, isn't it?

1292
01:37:29,476 --> 01:37:33,310
The more you try to simplify them,
the more complicated they get.

1293
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:37,242
So, without thinking anything,
we will drink.

1294
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:39,779
What say, Anna?

1295
01:37:39,887 --> 01:37:42,651
Yes, even I am thinking of
taking a second peg today.

1296
01:37:42,756 --> 01:37:44,314
Great, Anna!

1297
01:37:44,558 --> 01:37:47,721
Shankar, bring ice from
Gupta's house. - All right, sir.

1298
01:38:05,646 --> 01:38:06,670
Hello.

1299
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:08,405
Hello.

1300
01:38:16,457 --> 01:38:18,891
Whose call was it? - Blank call.

1301
01:38:20,194 --> 01:38:22,355
What have you decided?
- About what?

1302
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,823
About Raj. - Think what?

1303
01:38:25,933 --> 01:38:27,298
For me, the chapter is closed.

1304
01:39:13,447 --> 01:39:15,210
''They make me desperate.''

1305
01:39:15,983 --> 01:39:17,473
''They torment.''

1306
01:39:18,652 --> 01:39:22,679
''They make me go crazy.''

1307
01:39:23,390 --> 01:39:27,952
''Tell memories..

1308
01:39:28,262 --> 01:39:30,287
..why do they keep coming back?''

1309
01:39:30,864 --> 01:39:32,957
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1310
01:39:33,467 --> 01:39:35,765
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1311
01:39:36,003 --> 01:39:37,903
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1312
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:40,831
''They make me desperate.''

1313
01:39:41,542 --> 01:39:43,373
''They torment.''

1314
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:48,578
''They make me go crazy.''

1315
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:53,446
''Tell memories..

1316
01:39:53,954 --> 01:39:55,979
..why do they keep coming back?''

1317
01:39:56,423 --> 01:39:58,448
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1318
01:39:59,026 --> 01:40:01,517
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1319
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:04,994
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1320
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:30,547
''Even good times hurt when
they come as memories.''

1321
01:40:35,662 --> 01:40:40,497
''Even good times hurt when
they come as memories.''

1322
01:40:40,934 --> 01:40:45,837
''And repeat all
incidents forgotten.''

1323
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:50,569
''Even today, your tresses
make my breaths fragrant.''

1324
01:40:50,744 --> 01:40:54,840
''They fly, they tease.''

1325
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:59,910
''They make me go crazy.''

1326
01:41:00,754 --> 01:41:04,986
''Tell memories..''

1327
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:07,857
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1328
01:41:08,362 --> 01:41:10,387
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1329
01:41:10,764 --> 01:41:12,994
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1330
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:16,530
''Why do they keep coming back?''

1331
01:41:35,055 --> 01:41:36,079
Hello!

1332
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:40,087
Hello. Please give the line
to Madhuri. - Who is it?

1333
01:41:40,394 --> 01:41:41,418
Raj here.

1334
01:41:41,995 --> 01:41:43,428
Mahduri, Raj.

1335
01:41:43,997 --> 01:41:47,433
I don't want to talk to him.
Say I am not in.

1336
01:41:47,534 --> 01:41:51,971
Hello. - Look, I know she is there.
Please give her the phone.

1337
01:41:52,539 --> 01:41:53,767
He knows you are here.

1338
01:41:56,009 --> 01:41:57,909
Hello! - Hello Madhuri?!

1339
01:41:58,011 --> 01:41:59,444
Raj, I said I am not here.

1340
01:42:00,013 --> 01:42:01,503
Please don't call
me again and again.

1341
01:42:22,436 --> 01:42:25,928
Madhuri, listen to me.
- I don't want to hear anything.

1342
01:42:26,039 --> 01:42:27,063
Please, Madhuri.

1343
01:42:27,174 --> 01:42:28,664
Please leave me alone, Raj.
- Just a minute, Madhuri.

1344
01:42:28,775 --> 01:42:29,799
Leave me!

1345
01:42:30,043 --> 01:42:31,533
At least listen to me.

1346
01:42:32,446 --> 01:42:36,542
You are creating a scene. - Madhuri.
- Hey mister, what's up?

1347
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:39,011
Please leave us,
this is our personal matter.

1348
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,417
Let's go, it is their
personal matter.

1349
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:46,824
I stopped them this
time. Next time..

1350
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:51,888
Please Raj, don't try to meet me.

1351
01:43:13,687 --> 01:43:14,915
Great. It is great.

1352
01:43:21,028 --> 01:43:22,052
Listen.

1353
01:43:24,164 --> 01:43:25,188
Listen to me.

1354
01:43:25,766 --> 01:43:27,859
What? - What's wrong with Raj?

1355
01:43:31,238 --> 01:43:33,001
He has not gone to work
since two-three days.

1356
01:43:33,507 --> 01:43:36,135
He has become so silent. Quietly.

1357
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:40,204
You know everything, Janki.
- Yes.

1358
01:43:48,522 --> 01:43:51,150
Shall I tell you something?
- What?

1359
01:43:52,192 --> 01:43:53,682
Meet Madhuri once.

1360
01:43:54,127 --> 01:43:55,151
Meet her.

1361
01:43:57,531 --> 01:44:00,500
No Janki, Raj will not like it.

1362
01:44:00,667 --> 01:44:03,693
Don't worry about that.
At least meet her once.

1363
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:06,571
Maybe you find some solution.

1364
01:44:07,608 --> 01:44:08,973
A solution. I know.

1365
01:44:11,945 --> 01:44:12,969
Alright.

1366
01:44:13,947 --> 01:44:18,577
I myself wanted Raj and
Madhuri to get married.

1367
01:44:19,553 --> 01:44:21,043
Oan I talk to Madhuri?

1368
01:44:21,555 --> 01:44:23,853
But Raj doesn't want
to marry at all.

1369
01:44:24,558 --> 01:44:25,991
What can Madhuri do?

1370
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:33,261
If they are made to sit together..

1371
01:44:34,835 --> 01:44:35,859
It will not help.

1372
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:39,138
And anyway, Madhuri is
going back to Delhi.

1373
01:44:39,306 --> 01:44:43,208
What? - Yes. She
resigned yesterday.

1374
01:44:43,844 --> 01:44:46,870
When is she leaving?
- By tomorrow's flight.

1375
01:44:55,055 --> 01:44:58,616
''I don't know what is wrong,
what is right.''

1376
01:45:00,794 --> 01:45:04,161
''Why am I not under my control?''

1377
01:45:06,667 --> 01:45:11,570
''The love surely exists..

1378
01:45:11,672 --> 01:45:13,572
..my hearts says so.''

1379
01:45:13,674 --> 01:45:14,698
''I have to stay away
from such things..

1380
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:16,776
..my consoience says.''

1381
01:45:16,877 --> 01:45:17,901
I know.

1382
01:45:18,011 --> 01:45:22,311
''In this dilemma of yes and
no, my heart is trapped.''

1383
01:45:22,616 --> 01:45:27,918
''What happened, why did
it happen, is it that..''

1384
01:45:28,622 --> 01:45:30,988
''Maybe..''

1385
01:45:31,625 --> 01:45:33,718
''Yes, maybe.''

1386
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:36,656
''Maybe..''

1387
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:39,260
''Yes, maybe.''

1388
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,146
Driver, get the luggage out.

1389
01:46:07,661 --> 01:46:09,026
Madhuri! I just..

1390
01:46:09,129 --> 01:46:11,222
Hello, Raj.
- Hello, sir.

1391
01:46:12,666 --> 01:46:16,625
Oan I speak to Madhuri for two..
- Yes. You two talk.

1392
01:46:16,937 --> 01:46:18,234
We are waiting there.

1393
01:46:21,141 --> 01:46:22,165
Why have you come, Raj?

1394
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:27,840
Actually.. Gupta told me
that you're leaving, so..

1395
01:46:29,750 --> 01:46:35,382
I realized.. don't go, Madhuri.
- I'll have to go, Raj.

1396
01:46:36,690 --> 01:46:37,714
Please, Madhuri.

1397
01:46:39,359 --> 01:46:41,919
Raj, I am not leaving because
I don't love you.

1398
01:46:43,296 --> 01:46:45,059
When you love me,
why are you leaving?

1399
01:46:49,035 --> 01:46:52,402
Tell me Raj, what is the
destination of our relationship?

1400
01:46:55,709 --> 01:46:57,199
Marriage. - Raj.

1401
01:46:58,845 --> 01:47:01,336
Yes, Madhuri, I want to marry you.

1402
01:47:03,717 --> 01:47:07,414
You were right when you said
I run away from my problem.

1403
01:47:09,256 --> 01:47:12,282
But not anymore.
- I don't understand.

1404
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:17,026
Actually, I have found out
about one place.

1405
01:47:18,398 --> 01:47:21,026
Rahul will be well looked
after over there.

1406
01:47:23,403 --> 01:47:26,304
Are you doing this only for me?

1407
01:47:29,142 --> 01:47:33,374
No Madhuri, for both of us.

1408
01:48:38,478 --> 01:48:39,502
What is your name?

1409
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:47,046
Jai. Uncle.. your.. name? - Raj.

1410
01:49:04,838 --> 01:49:10,071
Brother, I'm hungry.
- Shankar, what about dinner?

1411
01:49:10,176 --> 01:49:11,200
I'm getting it.

1412
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,012
Food.

1413
01:49:23,123 --> 01:49:26,820
Rahul, eat yourself today. - No.

1414
01:49:28,862 --> 01:49:31,956
Rahul, you will have to get used
to eating yourself sometimes.

1415
01:49:32,265 --> 01:49:36,167
No, you feed me

1416
01:49:36,469 --> 01:49:38,960
Until when will I feed you?
You will have to learn sometime.

1417
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:45,834
No, you feed me.

1418
01:49:47,480 --> 01:49:49,038
Brother.

1419
01:49:49,883 --> 01:49:51,248
Feed me.

1420
01:49:53,887 --> 01:49:55,320
You are a big boy now.

1421
01:49:57,958 --> 01:50:00,927
Everyone laughs at me because
I have kept you home.

1422
01:50:01,428 --> 01:50:04,454
My boss scolds me in office because
I come back home early.

1423
01:50:06,099 --> 01:50:09,193
Rahul, even I get tired.

1424
01:50:09,636 --> 01:50:13,003
Going to office, cook food,
feed you. Bathe you. Right?

1425
01:50:13,907 --> 01:50:16,205
So I have seen a very
nice place for you.

1426
01:50:16,309 --> 01:50:19,608
You can play there, study there.
You'll even have lots of friends.

1427
01:50:19,980 --> 01:50:23,541
No..

1428
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:26,414
Even I will come there
to meet you everyday.

1429
01:50:29,656 --> 01:50:30,884
No.. No.

1430
01:50:30,991 --> 01:50:34,222
No.. No.

1431
01:50:46,406 --> 01:50:47,634
I will stay here.

1432
01:50:47,941 --> 01:50:51,035
I will eat myself.

1433
01:50:51,411 --> 01:50:53,572
I will bathe myself.

1434
01:50:54,481 --> 01:50:55,505
Don't send me.

1435
01:50:58,618 --> 01:51:01,644
Kaka.. brother..

1436
01:51:05,091 --> 01:51:10,324
Rahul, try to understand me.
It is in your interest too.

1437
01:51:10,430 --> 01:51:12,660
No.. No.

1438
01:51:19,639 --> 01:51:21,607
Here.. people..

1439
01:51:27,714 --> 01:51:29,272
Brother..

1440
01:51:33,987 --> 01:51:35,614
Hi, dad.
- Hello son. Take.

1441
01:51:36,656 --> 01:51:37,953
Mom, dad is back.

1442
01:51:42,395 --> 01:51:44,363
Good you are back.
- What happened?

1443
01:51:46,733 --> 01:51:48,633
I have heard Raj is sending
Rahul to the hospital?

1444
01:51:48,735 --> 01:51:49,963
He is putting him in hospital.

1445
01:51:50,070 --> 01:51:53,506
You have heard right.
- I won't allow that. Never.

1446
01:51:53,740 --> 01:51:57,176
Who are we to stop him?
- What do you mean? He is my son.

1447
01:51:57,677 --> 01:51:59,167
Second son.
- Janki!

1448
01:51:59,279 --> 01:52:00,974
Tell Raj, if he has no
place in his house..

1449
01:52:01,081 --> 01:52:02,309
I have lots of place here.

1450
01:52:02,615 --> 01:52:06,449
Don't talk like fools.
This is Raj's personal matter.

1451
01:52:07,220 --> 01:52:10,712
But why? If he wants to marry
Madhuri, let him marry her.

1452
01:52:11,491 --> 01:52:14,051
But why does he have to send Rahul
to the hospital for that?

1453
01:52:14,360 --> 01:52:15,384
What is the need?

1454
01:52:15,628 --> 01:52:16,720
I won't let him go.

1455
01:52:19,232 --> 01:52:20,665
Look, Janki,
I understand everything.

1456
01:52:21,768 --> 01:52:24,202
But we have no right to stop him.

1457
01:52:28,308 --> 01:52:31,744
When is he sending him?
- On the 6th.

1458
01:52:33,379 --> 01:52:34,403
Rahul!

1459
01:52:36,116 --> 01:52:39,347
Enough Rahul. Rahul enough!
Don't make me angry!

1460
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:41,277
Rahul.

1461
01:52:46,326 --> 01:52:47,759
Pack the bag again
or I will kill you!

1462
01:52:48,795 --> 01:52:50,023
Oome on!

1463
01:52:53,666 --> 01:52:54,690
Enough of your act.

1464
01:52:56,336 --> 01:53:00,033
What do you think? Pack
the bag! Pack the bag!

1465
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:01,164
Brother..

1466
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:03,037
Am I your father's servant?
I'll slap you!

1467
01:53:17,757 --> 01:53:19,054
No.. No.

1468
01:53:19,159 --> 01:53:22,390
No.. No.

1469
01:53:41,848 --> 01:53:46,285
''Being separated from
you, I will die.''

1470
01:53:46,853 --> 01:53:50,414
''Don't separate me like that.''

1471
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:58,094
''Even you will not be able to
live alone, unaccompanied..''

1472
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:00,428
''Without me.''

1473
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:06,571
''May your hand always be in mine.''

1474
01:54:06,673 --> 01:54:11,576
''Every heartbeat says..''

1475
01:54:12,145 --> 01:54:16,775
''May you and I always be together.''

1476
01:54:17,417 --> 01:54:21,649
''May you and I always be together.''

1477
01:54:34,767 --> 01:54:35,791
Brother..

1478
01:54:36,836 --> 01:54:40,533
Brother..
- Oareful. They know their job.

1479
01:54:40,773 --> 01:54:42,604
Oome, sit down.

1480
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:53,886
Rahul Santosh Dixit.
Aged 15 years.

1481
01:54:54,854 --> 01:54:55,878
Yes, doctor.

1482
01:54:56,189 --> 01:54:57,281
Anything else you want to tell me.

1483
01:54:58,191 --> 01:54:59,215
Yes, doctor.

1484
01:55:00,193 --> 01:55:03,685
Rahul doesn't eat anything except
Marie biscuit for breakfast.

1485
01:55:04,864 --> 01:55:06,422
That too, dipped in tea.

1486
01:55:06,532 --> 01:55:09,433
And, he doesn't like
brushing his teeth.

1487
01:55:09,869 --> 01:55:11,632
You have to coax him.

1488
01:55:11,738 --> 01:55:12,830
And he uses only
close-up toothpaste.

1489
01:55:14,807 --> 01:55:17,776
He likes butter in his rice,
not oil.

1490
01:55:19,812 --> 01:55:22,906
And while bathing him, he needs
a toy to be bathed with him.

1491
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:27,250
All that is mentioned here.
Anything else?

1492
01:55:31,891 --> 01:55:35,657
He sometimes wets the bed in sleep.

1493
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:37,586
That's okay.

1494
01:55:38,498 --> 01:55:43,595
Actually, not sometimes, everyday.
- Okay,

1495
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:46,265
Doctor, shall I go and
see what he is doing?

1496
01:55:46,439 --> 01:55:50,876
Don't worry, Mr. Raj.
He will be fine. - Ok.

1497
01:55:51,711 --> 01:55:52,735
I'll come tomorrow..

1498
01:55:52,845 --> 01:55:54,938
No, Mr. Raj, you cannot meet
him for a week now.

1499
01:55:56,249 --> 01:55:58,217
Why?
- If you meet him everyday..

1500
01:55:58,318 --> 01:56:00,946
..how will he adjust himself
in this atmosphere?

1501
01:56:03,923 --> 01:56:04,947
I understand.

1502
01:56:05,992 --> 01:56:08,756
So shall I leave? Yes.

1503
01:56:09,262 --> 01:56:12,959
Don't worry Mr. Raj, we will take
good care of him. Okay.

1504
01:56:13,266 --> 01:56:14,961
Bye.
- Thank you, doctor.

1505
01:56:16,936 --> 01:56:18,961
Mr. Gupta.

1506
01:56:19,939 --> 01:56:22,305
I am a free bird now. Free.

1507
01:56:23,276 --> 01:56:25,301
No tension, no worry.

1508
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:29,580
You are not drinking?
- I'm fine.

1509
01:56:29,682 --> 01:56:32,446
Shall I fill your glass?
- No, Raj, I don't want it.

1510
01:56:35,021 --> 01:56:36,579
O God!

1511
01:56:37,957 --> 01:56:44,658
15 years. 15 years.. feed him..

1512
01:56:44,764 --> 01:56:48,791
..bathe him, clean his dirt.

1513
01:56:50,503 --> 01:56:54,337
I am fed up. I am fed up.

1514
01:56:55,308 --> 01:56:58,539
I didn't take a promotion,
I didn't do overtime.

1515
01:57:02,315 --> 01:57:07,014
Well I am a free bird now.
Free bird, Mr. Gupta.

1516
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:10,286
I can do anything now.
Tell me, can't I?

1517
01:57:11,657 --> 01:57:12,954
Yes, Raj.

1518
01:57:18,531 --> 01:57:20,294
Aunt is angry.

1519
01:57:20,867 --> 01:57:21,891
Sorry.

1520
01:57:22,068 --> 01:57:25,435
Sorry, aunt. Sorry.

1521
01:57:25,538 --> 01:57:28,701
Raj, sit down.

1522
01:57:32,011 --> 01:57:33,035
Sorry.

1523
01:57:38,084 --> 01:57:40,314
Raj. Raj.

1524
01:57:42,355 --> 01:57:47,452
Don't I have a life?
Don't I wish to have a wife..

1525
01:57:48,094 --> 01:57:52,463
..children.. a car.

1526
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:57,396
And who is that.. - Who now?

1527
01:57:58,371 --> 01:58:01,863
That one.. my boss. - Subramanium?

1528
01:58:02,508 --> 01:58:04,339
Yes, Subbu.

1529
01:58:05,711 --> 01:58:09,340
He was a clerk.

1530
01:58:09,582 --> 01:58:16,078
He drives around in a car now,
that too, air conditioned.

1531
01:58:18,724 --> 01:58:22,023
It is very hot. It is very hot.

1532
01:58:22,128 --> 01:58:27,896
Mr. Gupta.
- Raj. Raj. - I am fine.

1533
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,902
Oome, I'll take you home.
- Sorry, aunt. Sorry

1534
01:58:32,605 --> 01:58:35,096
No tension, Mr. Gupta.

1535
01:58:52,625 --> 01:58:56,061
Hello, Batliwala, are you fine?
- Don't disturb me. - Hi, Raj.

1536
01:59:03,102 --> 01:59:04,592
Hello.
- Raj, there is a call for you.

1537
01:59:05,438 --> 01:59:06,462
Put me on.

1538
01:59:06,706 --> 01:59:07,866
Hi!
- Hi!

1539
01:59:09,108 --> 01:59:11,133
How are you? - I'm fine.

1540
01:59:12,044 --> 01:59:13,477
What happened? Are you
feeling alright?

1541
01:59:13,579 --> 01:59:18,073
Yes. - Remember,
today is Saturday?

1542
01:59:19,585 --> 01:59:22,019
Yes. - So you're coming
to my office at 3pm.

1543
01:59:23,122 --> 01:59:26,023
We will shop close to
my office today. Okay.

1544
01:59:27,193 --> 01:59:29,957
I'll be there.
- Bye, Raj. Love you. - Bye.

1545
01:59:35,134 --> 01:59:36,567
Any problem?

1546
01:59:39,138 --> 01:59:40,435
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning. Raj.

1547
01:59:40,540 --> 01:59:45,842
Raj, have you made this
report? - Yes, sir.

1548
01:59:45,945 --> 01:59:50,575
I can't believe this. - Wrong?

1549
01:59:50,683 --> 01:59:51,707
All the figures are wrong.

1550
01:59:52,485 --> 01:59:54,851
You have put the figures
of three years ago.

1551
01:59:55,154 --> 01:59:56,587
It is good I cross checked.

1552
01:59:57,156 --> 01:59:59,590
Sir.. what is the matter?
What is wrong with you?

1553
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:03,185
I'm Sorry. Sir. I'm not well.

1554
02:00:03,829 --> 02:00:04,853
Then you should have taken leave.

1555
02:00:06,165 --> 02:00:07,189
I am sorry.

1556
02:00:08,167 --> 02:00:09,862
It is ok. I will rectify the errors.

1557
02:00:10,169 --> 02:00:15,197
Sir. Yes. With your permission,
can I go home?

1558
02:00:15,508 --> 02:00:17,942
Oh, yes. No problem.
- Thank you, sir.

1559
02:00:18,044 --> 02:00:19,068
It is all right.

1560
02:00:19,979 --> 02:00:23,210
Hi. - Hello, sir.
- Hello. - Hi, Raj.

1561
02:00:27,253 --> 02:00:29,619
- You are leaving, Raj? - Yes.

1562
02:00:43,069 --> 02:00:45,503
Hello!
- Madhuri. It's Raj.

1563
02:00:45,938 --> 02:00:47,906
What happened? Why did you call?

1564
02:00:48,941 --> 02:00:51,102
We'll cancel the programme
for today.

1565
02:00:52,945 --> 02:00:53,969
Why?

1566
02:00:54,680 --> 02:00:56,773
Two directors of the company
have come from Kolkata.

1567
02:00:57,216 --> 02:00:59,116
The boss has called an
urgent meeting at 3 p.m.

1568
02:01:00,152 --> 02:01:04,054
Okay..
- Okay, listen.

1569
02:01:04,690 --> 02:01:07,056
Tomorrow is Sunday.
We'll go shopping from morning.

1570
02:01:07,960 --> 02:01:10,258
Alright. - I'll come
to your home tomorrow.

1571
02:01:11,230 --> 02:01:14,199
Ok, Raj. Bye.
- Ok, bye.

1572
02:01:28,247 --> 02:01:32,877
Take this leg forward.
A little forward. Enough.

1573
02:01:32,985 --> 02:01:34,145
Yes. Very good. Very good.

1574
02:01:34,253 --> 02:01:38,952
Mr. Raj, you? - I'd come
to meet a friend here.

1575
02:01:39,058 --> 02:01:41,686
I thought I'll inquire about Rahul

1576
02:01:41,861 --> 02:01:44,227
So you are Rahul's brother.
- Yes, doctor.

1577
02:01:44,330 --> 02:01:46,298
Then Mr. Gandhi must have
told you the rules.

1578
02:01:46,599 --> 02:01:47,691
You can't meet him for 8 days.

1579
02:01:47,933 --> 02:01:51,835
No, I have not come to meet him.
I'd come so far to meet a friend..

1580
02:01:51,937 --> 02:01:55,031
I just thought I'll inquire
about him. How is he?

1581
02:01:55,608 --> 02:01:56,768
He has not eaten or drank
anything since yesterday.

1582
02:01:56,876 --> 02:01:59,902
Meaning? How is that possible?

1583
02:02:00,146 --> 02:02:02,706
Look Mr. Raj, all children
do that in the beginning.

1584
02:02:03,149 --> 02:02:05,174
Then they get adjusted.
Don't worry, Mr. Raj.

1585
02:02:07,086 --> 02:02:10,578
Okay, Doctor. Doctor,
I have come so far,

1586
02:02:10,690 --> 02:02:14,057
..can I meet him for two minutes?

1587
02:02:14,293 --> 02:02:15,317
No. We can't allow you to.

1588
02:02:16,162 --> 02:02:17,322
Only from outside, doctor.

1589
02:02:17,630 --> 02:02:19,257
No. I am extremely sorry, Mr. Raj.

1590
02:02:19,632 --> 02:02:20,792
No, no, no. It's okay, doctor.

1591
02:02:22,034 --> 02:02:23,592
So shall I leave?

1592
02:02:26,105 --> 02:02:27,129
Okay, doctor.

1593
02:02:30,109 --> 02:02:31,133
Listen, Mr. Raj.

1594
02:02:34,113 --> 02:02:35,671
Go and meet Rahul.

1595
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:38,613
But only from outside.
- Yes, doctor.

1596
02:02:39,318 --> 02:02:41,684
Sister, show him Rahul's
room. - Yes. Oome.

1597
02:02:41,787 --> 02:02:47,350
Thank you doctor.
- A little ahead. Very good.

1598
02:02:53,332 --> 02:02:56,233
This is his room.
But please don't go inside.

1599
02:02:56,802 --> 02:02:57,826
I won't.

1600
02:03:45,785 --> 02:03:48,413
What happened?
Don't want to eat? - No!

1601
02:04:03,202 --> 02:04:06,433
Oome on, eat. - No.

1602
02:04:07,406 --> 02:04:08,430
You are blackmailing me?

1603
02:04:09,875 --> 02:04:12,036
What do you think? If you don't eat
for two days, I'll take you home?

1604
02:04:13,345 --> 02:04:18,908
Look, Rahul, don't
annoy me, eat. - No.

1605
02:04:19,218 --> 02:04:20,242
No - Then don't eat!

1606
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:22,115
Even if you die hungry,
I won't come to take you.

1607
02:04:23,489 --> 02:04:24,854
Neither do you live,
nor let me live.

1608
02:04:25,891 --> 02:04:27,984
Why are you staring
at me? I'll slap you!

1609
02:04:28,093 --> 02:04:29,321
Eat! Open your mouth.

1610
02:04:29,428 --> 02:04:34,866
Eat! Let me see how
you don't eat. Eat!

1611
02:04:34,967 --> 02:04:36,332
Open your mouth! Eat it!

1612
02:04:36,435 --> 02:04:37,459
Leave him alone I say.
- Eat!

1613
02:04:37,770 --> 02:04:39,738
Oome out. Oome out.
- Oome on.

1614
02:04:39,839 --> 02:04:40,931
Oome out.

1615
02:04:41,507 --> 02:04:43,270
I'll slap you! - Get out I say.

1616
02:04:43,375 --> 02:04:44,399
And don't you dare come here
for another eight days.

1617
02:04:44,510 --> 02:04:46,478
Why eight days, I won't
come for eight months.

1618
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:49,209
Who does he think he is?
Am I his father's servant?

1619
02:04:49,782 --> 02:04:51,409
Doesn't eat food indeed.
Don't eat!

1620
02:04:51,517 --> 02:04:54,077
Mr. Raj, go away.
- Yes, I am going.

1621
02:04:54,787 --> 02:04:56,015
I am fed up since 15 years.

1622
02:04:56,322 --> 02:04:59,348
Feed him everyday, clean
his dirt everyday.

1623
02:04:59,992 --> 02:05:04,224
I am fed up of you.
I will not come. Never!

1624
02:05:05,397 --> 02:05:07,490
He is blackmailing me!
I am leaving, I will not come!

1625
02:05:12,338 --> 02:05:13,362
You did a course?

1626
02:05:13,472 --> 02:05:15,440
I did do a copyrighting
course in Delhi.

1627
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:20,843
But since childhood,
I have been interested in it.

1628
02:05:21,947 --> 02:05:23,312
Raj, Madhuri has come.

1629
02:05:23,415 --> 02:05:26,509
Well, I just enjoy my job. - Yes.
- Lot of job satisfaction.

1630
02:05:28,220 --> 02:05:31,917
And nothing. It's fun. I like it.

1631
02:05:32,024 --> 02:05:35,926
Madhuri, when did you come?
- Hi, Raj. Just a while ago.

1632
02:05:36,428 --> 02:05:37,520
Ok, bye.
- Bye, thanks.

1633
02:05:39,565 --> 02:05:42,193
Oome inside.
- No, it's nice here.

1634
02:05:42,301 --> 02:05:43,996
Shall we sit here? - Sit down.

1635
02:05:47,106 --> 02:05:48,403
The meeting took very long?

1636
02:05:49,575 --> 02:05:52,135
They're buying a new
office in Bombay.

1637
02:05:53,512 --> 02:05:55,412
Where was the meeting?
- In the office.

1638
02:05:57,049 --> 02:05:59,950
Strange. When I called, they
told me you have left.

1639
02:06:02,121 --> 02:06:07,957
You called? - I thought
I'll come here tomorrow.

1640
02:06:08,527 --> 02:06:11,223
And then we will go shopping from
here. I wanted to tell you this.

1641
02:06:15,134 --> 02:06:19,571
Actually Madhuri..
- You went to meet Rahul?

1642
02:06:24,944 --> 02:06:27,572
Why didn't you tell me?
Even I'd come with you.

1643
02:06:29,548 --> 02:06:31,379
I won't go now. - Why?

1644
02:06:31,951 --> 02:06:34,112
He has not eaten since two days.
He is blackmailing me.

1645
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:39,585
We will go tomorrow
to meet him. - No.

1646
02:06:40,159 --> 02:06:41,990
And anyway, the doctor has said we
cannot meet him for eight days.

1647
02:06:42,561 --> 02:06:44,586
It's good, even I will get rest.

1648
02:06:54,239 --> 02:06:55,536
We will go tomorrow to meet him.

1649
02:07:50,963 --> 02:07:51,987
Suman, you?

1650
02:07:56,301 --> 02:07:58,667
You must have come
for your delivery.

1651
02:08:04,376 --> 02:08:05,400
Is Gupta in?

1652
02:08:20,526 --> 02:08:23,290
Raj, what is the matter?

1653
02:08:24,396 --> 02:08:27,092
I'm sorry, perhaps I woke you up.

1654
02:08:28,200 --> 02:08:31,101
No, I was not sleeping,
I was sitting. What is the matter?

1655
02:08:32,071 --> 02:08:33,629
It's dry day today.

1656
02:08:33,739 --> 02:08:36,708
Yes, the election
results are today.

1657
02:08:37,209 --> 02:08:39,109
Why? - You have a drink?

1658
02:08:40,679 --> 02:08:42,704
Sorry, even I don't have it today.

1659
02:08:44,016 --> 02:08:45,040
Let's go and check.
I'll wear my shirt.

1660
02:08:45,150 --> 02:08:48,051
No, it's okay. Suman has come.

1661
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:52,319
Yes. - Perhaps she is pregnant.

1662
02:08:57,629 --> 02:08:59,995
What happened, Gupta?
- The idiot ran away.

1663
02:09:03,168 --> 02:09:07,332
He ran away. He was married.

1664
02:09:07,773 --> 02:09:09,001
Gupta.

1665
02:09:12,311 --> 02:09:17,749
I am fine, Raj.
It's all a matter of destiny.

1666
02:09:19,785 --> 02:09:21,753
How could I leave my daughter alone?

1667
02:09:22,788 --> 02:09:24,016
I brought her back.

1668
02:09:28,260 --> 02:09:31,093
Listen.. go with him.

1669
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:36,092
No, it's okay, I am going.

1670
02:09:38,537 --> 02:09:39,765
You sit with Suman.

1671
02:11:52,337 --> 02:11:55,898
Rahul.. Rahul

1672
02:11:58,810 --> 02:11:59,834
Rahul.

1673
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:09,444
Where is Rahul?

1674
02:12:12,624 --> 02:12:15,388
Go.. you go!

1675
02:12:17,229 --> 02:12:18,253
Have you seen Rahul?

1676
02:12:24,236 --> 02:12:25,260
Have you seen Rahul?

1677
02:12:29,708 --> 02:12:30,800
Listen, Rahul..

1678
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:39,808
Rahul..

1679
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:42,344
Rahul..

1680
02:12:43,922 --> 02:12:44,946
Rahul..

1681
02:12:48,794 --> 02:12:50,557
Brother.
- Rahul.

1682
02:12:52,264 --> 02:12:53,288
Rahul.

1683
02:12:57,402 --> 02:12:59,962
Rahul, no! You'll fall.. Rahul!

1684
02:13:01,273 --> 02:13:02,297
Rahul..

1685
02:13:12,684 --> 02:13:16,313
Raj, Raj, where are you going?

1686
02:13:17,022 --> 02:13:18,990
Raj? - Why are you shouting
early morning?

1687
02:13:19,291 --> 02:13:21,384
Where did he go running
early morning?

1688
02:14:02,467 --> 02:14:03,627
Raj, so early in the morning?

1689
02:14:03,869 --> 02:14:08,966
Madhuri.. - Madhuri? Yes, come in.
- No, I want to meet Madhuri.

1690
02:14:09,474 --> 02:14:15,037
What happened, Raj?
- Madhuri, I want to..

1691
02:14:16,415 --> 02:14:19,578
Is everything alright? Rahul..
- Rahul is fine.

1692
02:14:20,685 --> 02:14:24,712
Oome inside. - No, Madhuri.
I've come to tell you..

1693
02:14:26,024 --> 02:14:28,049
I cannot marry you. - What?

1694
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:33,988
Yes, Madhuri, I cannot
live without Rahul.

1695
02:14:35,767 --> 02:14:39,328
I realized today that Rahul
is not dependent on me..

1696
02:14:39,438 --> 02:14:42,407
.. I am dependent on him.
- Raj, I..

1697
02:14:43,375 --> 02:14:45,935
I am sorry, Madhuri. I am sorry.

1698
02:14:46,044 --> 02:14:49,946
But.. Raj, listen! Raj!

1699
02:15:28,553 --> 02:15:30,043
You? - I've come to meet the doctor.

1700
02:15:30,622 --> 02:15:31,646
Go along with him.

1701
02:15:37,696 --> 02:15:39,129
What is wrong with you, Mr. Raj?

1702
02:15:39,698 --> 02:15:40,858
Why do you come here every time?

1703
02:15:41,566 --> 02:15:43,727
The nurse was saying you created
a scene here yesterday.

1704
02:15:44,102 --> 02:15:45,729
If you do that, it will be
difficult to keep Rahul here.

1705
02:15:46,705 --> 02:15:49,071
That is what I want.
I have come to take him back.

1706
02:15:49,641 --> 02:15:51,404
What? - I am taking him away.

1707
02:15:53,111 --> 02:15:56,137
Think it over.
We will not keep him here again.

1708
02:15:57,048 --> 02:15:58,413
I was mad to bring him here.

1709
02:15:59,985 --> 02:16:04,479
I will die without him.
Please, doctor. Please. - Ok.

1710
02:16:05,123 --> 02:16:06,886
Nurse, take him to Rahul's room.
- Yes, doctor.

1711
02:16:07,125 --> 02:16:09,150
No, I know where Rahul is.

1712
02:16:09,794 --> 02:16:11,159
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

1713
02:16:22,140 --> 02:16:25,166
Rahul. Rahul.

1714
02:16:27,145 --> 02:16:28,169
Rahul.

1715
02:16:32,150 --> 02:16:35,176
I ate food.

1716
02:16:35,887 --> 02:16:37,787
Don't beat me.

1717
02:16:39,090 --> 02:16:42,457
Don't beat me.
- Rahul, let's go home.

1718
02:16:42,761 --> 02:16:49,132
No, you go, I will stay here.

1719
02:16:49,968 --> 02:16:54,871
I cannot live without you. Oome.
Let's go home. - Go

1720
02:16:56,174 --> 02:17:01,202
You go, I will stay here.
- Forgive me. Forgive me.

1721
02:17:06,117 --> 02:17:10,213
Go!
- Beat me.. beat me!

1722
02:17:11,656 --> 02:17:13,487
You should beat a man like
me. I am your brother..

1723
02:17:13,592 --> 02:17:15,890
..yet I separated you from me.

1724
02:17:18,063 --> 02:17:19,087
Beat me.

1725
02:17:19,998 --> 02:17:21,022
Beat me.

1726
02:17:22,734 --> 02:17:23,826
Brother.

1727
02:17:28,273 --> 02:17:36,578
''I know what you mean to me,
how do I tell you?''

1728
02:17:38,550 --> 02:17:46,855
''When you are hurt,
I feel the pain.''

1729
02:17:48,159 --> 02:17:52,926
''May you always be with me.''

1730
02:17:53,231 --> 02:17:58,066
''Every heartbeat says..''

1731
02:17:58,770 --> 02:18:03,730
''May you and I always be together.''

1732
02:18:03,975 --> 02:18:08,537
''May you and I always be together.''

1733
02:18:23,061 --> 02:18:24,551
Hey Shilpa!
- Where are they?

1734
02:18:36,141 --> 02:18:37,165
Rahul has come!

1735
02:18:37,876 --> 02:18:40,242
Rahul has come!

1736
02:18:40,345 --> 02:18:41,573
Rahul has come!

1737
02:18:41,880 --> 02:18:46,317
Hey Rahul.. Rahul.

1738
02:18:47,285 --> 02:18:49,583
Hey Rahul!

1739
02:19:06,838 --> 02:19:07,862
Rahul, how are you?

1740
02:19:23,655 --> 02:19:25,020
Rahul, have you forgotten us?

1741
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:35,823
Raj.

1742
02:20:08,366 --> 02:20:09,390
Brother..

1743
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:12,666
It is good you brought
Rahul back, Raj.

1744
02:20:14,773 --> 02:20:15,933
I have loved you.

1745
02:20:17,375 --> 02:20:19,400
So I should have accepted
your responsibilities too.

1746
02:20:21,446 --> 02:20:24,415
Trying to be practical,
I have hurt your feelings.

1747
02:20:27,051 --> 02:20:28,075
I am sorry.

1748
02:20:32,857 --> 02:20:33,881
I am sorry. Rahul.

1749
02:20:46,738 --> 02:20:47,762
Brother.

1750
02:20:53,945 --> 02:20:58,439
Brother. Madhuri..

1751
02:21:00,752 --> 02:21:06,918
Madhuri.. come here.

1752
02:21:11,362 --> 02:21:12,454
Madhuri..

1753
02:21:42,327 --> 02:21:46,889
''May you and I always be together.''

1754
02:21:47,131 --> 02:21:52,296
''May you and I always be together.''

1755
02:21:53,338 --> 02:21:56,967
''It's written in your fate.''

1756
02:21:58,343 --> 02:22:02,177
''We are bound together
by our hearts.''

1757
02:22:03,481 --> 02:22:07,781
''It's written in your fate.''

1758
02:22:08,553 --> 02:22:12,455
''We are bound together
by our hearts''

1759
02:22:13,224 --> 02:22:18,127
''Every heartbeat says
only one thing.''

1760
02:22:18,830 --> 02:22:23,790
''We will always be together.''

1761
02:22:24,035 --> 02:22:28,802
''We will always be together.''

1762
02:22:29,107 --> 02:22:32,873
''It's written in your fate.''

1763
02:22:34,312 --> 02:22:39,079
''We are bound together
by our hearts.''
