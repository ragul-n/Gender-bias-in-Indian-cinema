1
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:57,115
Bodinayakkanur.

2
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:33,280
CEMETERY

3
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:49,130
Bodinayakkanur Cemetery.

4
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,638
Who are you, dear?

5
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,976
How did you come here?

6
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:07,975
Oh God!

7
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:52,991
Lord Shiva himself
has taken birth. Have a look.

8
00:05:50,483 --> 00:06:09,859
TAMILINI

9
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,702
Why are you crying? ls it because
your mother is dead?

10
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,006
Or is it because you were
born in a cemetery?

11
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,834
This is the place where
Lord Shiva resides.

12
00:06:18,277 --> 00:06:19,209
You shouldn't cry.

13
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:21,012
You're born with death as the boon.

14
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,682
Do you know who you're?
You're the son of Lord Shiva.

15
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,680
You're going to spend
your entire life here.

16
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:35,783
O crescent moon! You're born
for a good cause.

17
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:44,628
O flower! You've blossomed.

18
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,036
No need to grow feeble.

19
00:06:52,245 --> 00:07:01,711
You've taken birth where lives end.

20
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:11,827
Your dawn is here.

21
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:53,702
TAMILINI

22
00:07:54,807 --> 00:08:00,507
Were you keen to live a
solitary life on this earth?

23
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:08,113
With that determination did
you ask for this boon?

24
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,788
Those who want to see the
face can look at it.

25
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:10,978
l'm going to cover the face.

26
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:17,426
Either it's a garden or a desert,

27
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:24,125
flowers are flowers, their
identities will never change.

28
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:34,645
Neither poverty nor
affluence can change you.

29
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,752
Know who you're.

30
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,226
Tell me what are your
belongings in this world.

31
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,596
Know who you're.

32
00:08:55,935 --> 00:09:27,792
TAMILINI

33
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:34,203
Only the dead
come in search of you.

34
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:44,213
Human bonds mean nothing to you.

35
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,712
Those who rolled in money,

36
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,378
those who were proud
of their position,

37
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,219
those who were at the
pinnacle of fame.

38
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:57,828
Those who became famous
& then became infamous,

39
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:04,502
you saw these attributes
being burnt to ashes.

40
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,629
You're the man of crystal clear mind.

41
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:54,274
l've none.

42
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,951
l never saw my mother &
l'm the son of the cemetery.

43
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,792
My life is with the dead.

44
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,127
l'm the common son of God & Earth.

45
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,533
Did you die to make me
understand this truth?

46
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,635
You've left this Chitthan stranded.

47
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,564
Gomathi, how are you?
Give me a packet worth Rs.10.

48
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,507
Can't you tender exact change?

49
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,675
Am l running a bank?

50
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,343
Do you want a bank to be
handed over to a drug peddler?

51
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,838
The bank will be swindled.- l see.

52
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,180
You usually take brandy.

53
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:56,511
What happened to you now?

54
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:00,010
What do you mean?
Brandy for the work l do!

55
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,688
They had launched mini bottles
3 months back.

56
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,015
They've stopped them now.

57
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,419
l've no other choice other than this.

58
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,541
Give me 2 packets.

59
00:12:23,142 --> 00:12:23,938
Are you studying?

60
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,038
l won't give.- Why sister?

61
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,875
What sister? Look at the
faces taking drugs.

62
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,210
Do you pull a cart or pedal rickshaw?

63
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,717
They take drugs to get
rid of the pain.

64
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,218
What's wrong with you people?

65
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,891
Stop advicing. We are paying money,
aren't we? Give it.

66
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,889
l'll slipper you, Get lost.
- Talk respectfully.

67
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,823
What bloody respect.

68
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,231
Are you taking drugs at this age?
- Forget it Gomathi.

69
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,559
Our bodies will be finally eaten up by
worms in the sand, let them enjoy.

70
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:49,894
Get lost.

71
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,571
Look at this face, idiot.

72
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,636
They've started taking drugs
at a very young age.

73
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,423
Hey, what's it?

74
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,759
He's a cremator, isn't he?

75
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,264
He has come to ruin our
livelihood. Get lost.

76
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:24,936
l say get lost.

77
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,604
Hey, kick him out.

78
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,499
You shouldn't come to these places.
Go there & eat.

79
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,445
l say, go...

80
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,115
Won't you listen to me?
l say get lost.

81
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,148
How dare you stare at me?

82
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,140
Why this wall-eyed stare?
Throw him out.

83
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,109
You're eating as if
you've paid for it.

84
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,569
Why are they fighting like this?

85
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,898
You people are simply watching
the show, stop them.

86
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:24,975
Go away.

87
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:27,143
Get lost.

88
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,914
Have you also joined hands
with him & hitting us?

89
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,488
He's a cremator,
do you know that?

90
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,258
He's just walking into the shop.

91
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:40,161
What are you people looking at?
Go...Go...

92
00:16:40,866 --> 00:16:42,333
You've opened the eatery for others
to come & eat, haven't you?

93
00:16:44,036 --> 00:16:45,663
How can you call yourself
a respectable elder?

94
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,338
How can you simply watch
them fighting?

95
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,336
You don't interfere.
He'll eat and go away.

96
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,168
Thinking that l'm preparing food
from the rice offered to dead,

97
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:53,004
won't the stinking villagers curse me?

98
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,681
Why did you open the shop
in this stinking village?

99
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,607
Stinking villagers!

100
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,848
You're stinking like a corpse
even when you're alive.

101
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,683
Only God knows how badly
you'll stink when you die.

102
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:08,356
O Bravo! You want food,
don't you? Come.

103
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,020
Come.

104
00:17:10,896 --> 00:17:13,023
Scoundrel. He has ruined
my shop in a short while.

105
00:17:13,232 --> 00:17:14,028
Light the stove.

106
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:19,193
lf you fight on the streets,
police will arrest all of you. Got it?

107
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:21,467
Eat.

108
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,453
My God. lt seems you've been starving.

109
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,457
lf no one dies in the village,
you'll be in a fix.

110
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,455
Hey, give him water.

111
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:52,367
Brother, remember my face,
they'll bring me there soon.

112
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,366
lf my body gets up from
the burning pyre,

113
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,199
don't hit it. l won't be able
to bear the pain.

114
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,705
Just scold. l'll lie down.

115
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,309
Give it to me. Give it to me.

116
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:29,035
Hey what man? Get lost.

117
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,609
Hey...

118
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,184
l got terribly scared.

119
00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:17,514
Look at the way, he's glaring.

120
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:19,850
Hey, get up and go.
Simply sticking behind me.

121
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:22,189
You'll not go?

122
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:24,696
Hello, what else do you need?

123
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,089
Don't you've any job?
Why do you trouble me?

124
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:32,533
Job? l've a District Magistrate's job.
Would you like to take it up?

125
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:34,864
Very good.

126
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,201
l'm eking my livelihood
by peddling packets.

127
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:38,205
Now you've also joined me?

128
00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,704
l thought of working as a
servant maid leaving this job.

129
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,437
But they've branded me
as drug peddler.

130
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,716
How do you expect me
to get you a job?

131
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,392
Hey, where was he hiding?
- Behind...''hills''.

132
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:55,719
l don't know, what's going
to happen to you.

133
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:03,231
Drag him and come.
Go man...Go...

134
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,411
How much money did you take?

135
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,247
Did you take it from the
policeman or narcotics people?

136
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:20,251
Taking money from them is equal
to eating their defiled food.

137
00:20:21,286 --> 00:20:23,083
Sir, please leave him.

138
00:20:23,288 --> 00:20:28,248
Sir please don't....
He did it unknowingly.

139
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:30,424
He did it unknowingly. Leave him.

140
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:31,425
lt's enough, leave him.

141
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,427
l say leave. He might die.

142
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,096
l shouldn't see his face again.

143
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:36,434
Hey Lawyer, come here.

144
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:40,760
Lawyer, dump all the crimes on him for
the cases police are hunting our men,

145
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:41,701
and send him behind bars.

146
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:45,174
Hey, will you accept?
- Yes sir, l'll....

147
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:49,436
He has accepted, hasn't he? Why do
you get tensed? You're already sick?

148
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:50,273
Shit!

149
00:20:50,816 --> 00:20:54,047
Hey, don't think
l've become old.

150
00:20:54,653 --> 00:20:56,951
l'll chop each one of you
into pieces.- Hey take him.

151
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,053
My name is imprinted on the each
& every grain that you eat.

152
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:01,960
Be loyal.

153
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:03,127
Sir...

154
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:04,992
What do you want?

155
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:07,863
Do you want to get it only from me
what you're selling?

156
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,527
Get it from them.

157
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:10,968
l want a job.

158
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:12,462
What's wrong with your present job?

159
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,465
Not for me, for him.

160
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,801
Do you think the workers
working here are helpful to me?

161
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:19,807
ls he going to help me?
No job.

162
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:23,311
Don't say like that.
Even he's an orphan like me.

163
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,312
He was brought up in the
cemetery right from his birth.

164
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,985
Poor guy, he doesn't know
how to mingle with village people.

165
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:34,151
Police, money etc...He doesn't know
any of those things.

166
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:35,326
What else he knows then?

167
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,663
You mentioned something just now,
loyalty. He only knows that.

168
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:42,228
He's sticking around me like a dog
for feeding him just once.

169
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:50,004
Hey buddy, take him along
with you to the hills.

170
00:21:50,709 --> 00:21:53,507
Sir, why take him to such a far
off place. Give him some job here.

171
00:21:53,712 --> 00:21:55,577
Hey don't order me.

172
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,398
By then, l finished my
diagram & submitted it.

173
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,388
Greetings...

174
00:22:37,923 --> 00:22:40,050
lt'll not come again if it goes.

00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,371
Don't be afraid, it's not gambling.

180

182
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:58,933
Watch carefully sir.

183
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,375

You will get double the money
lf you've bet on the winning square.

200
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:45,249
lf you've kept your money on
the square which hasn't fallen.

201
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,685
That money will go to the company.

202
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,052
What does ''company'' mean brother?

203
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,160
Shouting at the top of my voice
for quarter square meal.

Have faith sir.
Faith is Life!

208

Nobody is ruined so far
after believing me.

209
00:23:58,036 --> 00:23:59,765
But there are many who were
ruined by not believing me.

210
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,997
lt'll not be worth much if
you keep it in your pocket.

211
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,175
You'll get silver coins
if you keep it here.

Why do you roll that?
Couldn't you keep it down as it is?

00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:29,389
Why are you becoming so brutal?

311
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,399

You roll... you'll only win
for your noble heart.

00:30:04,035 --> 00:30:05,935
He has said, hasn't he? Come on...

On which square are you going to keep?

327
00:30:13,111 --> 00:30:14,908
Padmini.- Keep it.

328
00:30:24,923 --> 00:30:26,686
Goddess!

329
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:53,947
Oh God!

Oh god, why is she behaving like this?
Manju, get up.

334

Hey, don't start your stories,
drink silently.

335
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:34,181
Hey, why are you offering him
liquor again & again.

336
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:35,723
You know that he'll cry
after having it.

337
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:39,428
Oh God, we are drinking liquor after
grabbing money from a student.

338
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,422
We'll be ruined!

339
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,293
That goddess will come in my
dreams & pluck out my eyes.

340
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:45,764
Definitely she'll pluck them out.

341

lt's a sin to join you people.- ls it?

344
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,006
Why do you remind him about
that often? Shut up!

345
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,851
Dear Sakthi, nothing much man.

346
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,317
You'll forget everything
in the morning. Keep quiet okay.

347
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,116
ls it!- Why are you asking
such questions?

348
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:17,651
'Cannabis plantations', Bodimettu.

349
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,993
Why are you smoking 'beedi' so cooly?

350
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:27,994
lf it gets burnt,

351
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,763
Do you know its worth?

352
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:34,028
Are you smoking 'beedi'?
Will you smoke?

Hey bring tea.

What sort of a person
you've appointed?

357
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,501
He's smoking beedi without knowing
the worth of Cannabis fields.

358
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,669
How can l entrust this job to them?

359
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,734
Couldn't you give them the job
after knowing their past?

360
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,245
You're blaming him.
Look at the one who's coming.

361
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,248
He doesn't know the value
of money, people etc.

362
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,348
Look, he's not greeting also.

363
00:35:53,551 --> 00:35:55,781
Hey, boss has come, what's
wrong if you greet him?

364
00:36:11,736 --> 00:36:13,931
Hey, savage, do you've brains?
- Hey boss is here.

365
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,106
Hey, he's hitting me for
asking him to greet him.

366
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,137
Hey, get down!

367

Go away man.

You go.

370
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:37,790
Why are you just watching uncle?

371
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,020
Person who salutes will
have a price on his head.

372
00:36:41,232 --> 00:36:42,130
But he's not like that.

373
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:05,486
Why's he putting make-up
for 15 mins.?

374
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,019
Okay?

375
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,598
Truth never fails.

376
00:37:18,202 --> 00:37:20,170
Truth never fails.

377
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,669
Truth alone triumphs.
- He has come again.- Keep quiet.

378
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:24,397
Truth alone triumphs.

379

00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:29,856
Where's that handsome young man
wearing a yellow shirt?

515
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:31,699
Mad woman!

516
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,036
Take out Rs.500!

517
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,804
Rs. 500 for what?
- lt's because you went to shit.

518
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:49,976
Come on, move.

519
00:44:50,487 --> 00:44:51,886
What are you doing here?

520
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:52,919
Buddy, ask them to start.

521
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,492
Water in Kondakudi river
is just ankle deep.

522
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,924
Cross the river &
deliver it carefully.

523
00:44:59,163 --> 00:44:59,720
Come on, go.

524
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,192
Take those horses that side.

525
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:09,862
Go...go.

526
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,215
Hey, hold it strongly.

527
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:41,230
Go via Vattaparai.

528
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,704
4352...4352 calling Koravachi post.

529
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:24,607
Yes, speaking from Koravachi post.

530
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,182
Cannabis consignment.

531
00:46:26,416 --> 00:46:28,247
from Atyut via Oramuthu.

532
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:24,836
Catch them.

533
00:48:08,819 --> 00:48:10,013
They've escaped.

534
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,165
How long should we
interrogate you?

535
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:27,526
We are just asking who is your boss
& where is it grown?

536
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,831
Tell us & go away.
We'll set you free.

537
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,601
We'll even give you money.

538
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:36,875
Tell us the truth.

539
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:41,876
Hey...

540
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,211
Don't test my patience.
l'll beat you to death.

541
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,396
What happened?
Did he tell the truth?- No.

542
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,429
lt seems only you can
make him speak.

543
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:03,836
Won't you tell the truth?

544
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,702
He's asking you, isn't he?
Why are you roaring?

545
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:24,051
Under NDPS Act Section 20,
Sub clause 1 , Sub-Section B,

546
00:50:24,321 --> 00:50:25,618
for smuggling Cannabis,

547
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,555
& for breaking the hands
of the policemen,

548
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,226
& for causing serious injuries
& for attempt of murder,

549
00:50:31,895 --> 00:50:35,661
Under lPC Section 324, 325 & 307,

550
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,365
a case has been filed against you.

551
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:49,103
'Kalnar'.

552
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:51,003
'Kalnar' Basil oil.

553
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:58,848
An oil made from
18 rarest herbs.

554
00:50:59,356 --> 00:51:00,653
What do you mean 'Rarest'?

555
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:06,818
Taking birth as a human
is the rarest thing.

556
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:12,668
Taking birth without any handicap
is still rarer.

557
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,327
Thank you very much.

558
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:17,567
O Lord! You rule this world
with Tamil language.

559
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:18,934
What is cruel?

560
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:26,545
Poverty is cruel.

561
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:36,221
Poverty at youth is still cruel.

562
00:51:38,562 --> 00:51:40,393
What shit profession is this?

563
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,565
Buy me a couple of pigs.
l'll graze them & get you money.

564
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:46,702
l'm fed up showing these nuts & herbs
to them & getting money from them.

565
00:51:47,137 --> 00:51:49,071
We must pay our house rent.
Come on, sing.

566
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:54,300
Having a disease is a very
cruel thing.

567
00:51:55,011 --> 00:51:56,672
This is said by Poetess Avaiyar
& not by me.

568
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,074
lf you ask any one which is
the deadliest disease?

569
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,408
Many will say 'AlDS'.
A few will say 'Leprosy'.

570
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,915
lf you ask me, l swear on you,

571
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,588
World's deadliest disease
is Gas trouble.

572
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,256
lt means letting out
the Gas collected in you.

573
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,856
l'm not saying this for you
people to laugh. Think.

574
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,524
Superb idea.

575
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:19,326
They are giving us chocolates
for the balance change.

576
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:20,969
lf we file a case against them
in Consumer court,

577
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:21,899
we'll get Rs. 1 lac.

578
00:52:22,105 --> 00:52:24,073
Oh God! She's always after money.
- They've started the show.

579
00:52:24,274 --> 00:52:25,707
Park the cycle &
get the token fast.

580
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:26,738
Go.

581
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,208
Move....move.

582
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:35,040
My dear people, l'm going to narrate
a story to you.

583
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,549
Come closer & listen.

584
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,448
ln America, there lived a husband
& wife with children.

585
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,591
Poor husband!
He had gas trouble.

586
00:52:42,792 --> 00:52:45,124
While sleeping at night,
he let the gas out.

587
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:46,987
Because her husband,
farted,

588
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:47,822
she said that
she lost her sleep.

589
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,864
The wife filed a case, got
divorced & took away her son.

590
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,466
He could've appealed
in the Supreme Court.

591
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,897
Was it to file an appeal or
to let out his gas?

592
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,036
l'm narrating you the story,
am l not?

593
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:59,197
But here, our boys eat Peas
in huge quantities while boozing,

594
00:52:59,409 --> 00:53:02,640
and at night lets out the gas
in all directions.

595
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:08,978
lf his wife ask him, ''why are you tearing
the clothes given by my father?''

596
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:09,811
He'll say 'Get lost'.

597
00:53:10,153 --> 00:53:12,144
and he also says 'Barking dogs
seldom bite'.

598
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,051
lt means, if we let our gas out slowly,
it'll stink.

599
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:16,691
Will it smell sweet
if we let it out loudly?

600
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,726
ln a public place where
people gather & talk,

601
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:28,996
one guy will let out the gas.

602
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,829
Everyone will close his nose.

603
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:32,004
The one who let it out will say,

604
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,972
'Some scoundrel has exploded a bomb'.

605
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:35,610
Because he knows it first.

606
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:37,746
People will even accept
murder charge.

607
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:39,176
But no one will accept that
he has let out the gas.

608
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:39,848
But why?

609
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,517
lt's the matter of his honor.

610
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,186
Your silence,

611
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,855
makes me feel that many of you
would've done this.

612
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:47,986
No problem.

613
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:50,318
Your gas trouble which hasn't been
cured by any country medicine,

614
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,528
just take a spoonful
of the medicine l give you,

615
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,960
the gas will come out with the
fragrance of a flower.

616
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:00,630
The next problem we are
going to tackle is...

617
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,138
Constipation.
- Yes, Constipation!

618
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:05,470
Constipation gives rise
to many problems.

619
00:54:06,042 --> 00:54:09,011
A man must shit twice,
morning & evening.

620
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,112
Let anyone die in your house,

621
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,438
you must not stop that.

622
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:13,339
lf we stop it,

623
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,116
we'll also stink along with
the dead body.

624
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:20,883
Don't mistake me for talking
about issues which stink.

625
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:21,950
Priest, do you want it?

626
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:23,556
No, l don't.
l'm just watching.

627
00:54:24,294 --> 00:54:27,525
l know, you won't need this.
Because, after taking bath,

628
00:54:27,897 --> 00:54:30,422
he'll go around the basil plant thrice
& will eat a couple of Basil leaves.

629
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:31,991
But, we are not like that.

630
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:34,230
Like the dogs which
search the lamp-post,

631
00:54:34,571 --> 00:54:38,871
we search for a place full of plants
& creepers and we'll piss there.

632
00:54:39,376 --> 00:54:40,707
Don't mistake me for
praising a particular caste.

633
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:41,909
Many people from Brahmin family,

634
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,213
hold high posts like
Engineers, Doctors & Judges.

635
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:46,211
Because they know the
importance of Basil leaf.

636
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,711
You also give this
to your children.

637
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:50,075
Their memory power will increase.
Vomiting & constipation will stop.

638
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,718
lf they don't stop,
l'll stop selling.

639
00:54:52,589 --> 00:54:54,056
Come & get it, sir.
- Give me one....

640
00:54:54,257 --> 00:54:56,623
Everyone, take it.- Give me one. Give
this to your grandsons & grand daughters.

641
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:59,090
Get me one. Give me some more.
Come....come.

642
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,422
lt smells like sison seeds.

643
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:02,758
This is the nature of our people.

644
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,058
You raise umpteen number of questions
when we come to serve you.

645
00:55:05,435 --> 00:55:06,402
lf anyone books a room
in a lodge.

646
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,594
And advertise in paper about the
time & date of consultation,

647
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:09,897
you'll go there on time.

648
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:12,366
And they'll grab you like a hen,

649
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,166
and will leave you after swindling
Rs.2,000 to 3,000 from you.

650
00:55:14,778 --> 00:55:15,506
We are not like them.

651
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,574
Our medical store is
right in front of you.

652
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:18,914
As l tell them the percentage of medicine,

653
00:55:19,249 --> 00:55:22,241
he'll crush them & he'll grind them
into paste. Come & buy it.

654
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,381
She's coming.

655
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,145
Why did you bring the police now?

656
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,081
Stay here.

657
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,950
lt's a gift to your children from us.

658
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:31,624
Come....come.- Give me a bottle.

659
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:35,264
A bottle costs only Rs.50.- Give me a
bottle.- Come on.- Give it to me.- Who else?

660
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:36,897
Brother-in-law, give me 4 bottles.

661
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:37,896
Come & buy.

662
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:43,905
You're finished.

663
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,443
Leave me, you pig.

664
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,411
Oh no! Why are you hitting her?

665
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,504
Why are you beating a girl like this?

666
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,408
Don't beat her.- Oh my god!

667
00:55:55,151 --> 00:55:56,379
Why are you beating a girl like this?

668
00:55:56,586 --> 00:55:59,020
Leave her. You Karuppan!
You scoundrel!

669
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:03,285
Hey, it's police....

670
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:05,961
Oh my god! Police.

671
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,957
Hey....- Hey Manju!

672
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:09,995
You thief!

673
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,128
Don't come....don't come.- Stop.

674
00:56:14,003 --> 00:56:14,469
Stop.

675
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,662
How dare you bring the police?
You useless girl!- Oh no!

676
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:19,642
Manju....stop.

677
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:33,014
Get up....get up.

678
00:56:34,357 --> 00:56:35,255
Where are you trying to run away?

679
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,491
l won't leave you.

680
00:56:42,532 --> 00:56:44,625
Get down.- l won't.

681
00:56:46,369 --> 00:56:49,702
Oh God! Why are you running with a girl
on your back? Put her down.

682
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:52,566
Oh my god!

683
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:54,241
Oh my god!

684
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,240
Go & catch her quickly. Manju....

685
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:06,581
Come, girls. He's running in the same
direction. Follow me....follow me.

686
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:14,590
l can't....l can't. Get down.

687
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:23,195
Catch him. Don't leave him.
Come....come....catch him.

688
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:23,997
Police....

689
00:57:24,207 --> 00:57:25,299
Catch her....catch her.

690
00:57:25,508 --> 00:57:26,600
Police.....police...

691
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:29,806
Hold his hand...

692
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:31,770
You fraud!

693
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:37,344
Police....Police....
- Beat him.

694
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,080
Listen to me.

695
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,522
She's trying to kill me &
you're coming late, you fatso!

696
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:46,626
Oh no! sister...sister.

697
00:57:56,573 --> 00:57:59,235
The head constable is opening the lock.

698
00:57:59,542 --> 00:58:01,635
Ask him to stay aside.- Get in.

699
00:58:01,845 --> 00:58:02,869
Okay, see you later.

700
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:05,371
The place looks like a Star hotel.

701
00:58:06,783 --> 00:58:07,841
l'm Sakthi....Sakthivel.

702
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,946
Manufacturer of medicine
without license, 420.

703
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:10,719
And you?

704
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:12,285
Come on, tell me.

705
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:13,213
Chit fund.

706
00:58:15,191 --> 00:58:16,055
Chit fund owner!

707
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,086
How's that possible?

708
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,961
l'm a compulsive liar.

709
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,057
But no one gets trapped.

710
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:26,867
How do they fall in your trap?

711
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:30,065
They see me & believe me.
How can l be faulted?

712
00:58:30,707 --> 00:58:32,504
Do people believe you, if you speak
Tamil language incorrectly?

713
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:34,371
l'll try this, once l go out.

714
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:36,068
Thank you Guruji.

715
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:39,915
And you?

716
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:41,345
Eve teasing.

717
00:58:42,051 --> 00:58:43,575
He teased a girl.- What?

718
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:45,146
l only asked her name.

719
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,648
But they've put me in
for 3 months.- Oh no!

720
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:52,591
lnstead of marrying a girl
whom you love,

721
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,262
if you marry the girl
who loves you.

722
00:58:54,464 --> 00:58:56,591
Oh god! - The proverb
looks old, doesn't it?

723
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,629
Fraud may prevail on justice
for time being.

724
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:02,301
But justice will win in the end.

725
00:59:02,805 --> 00:59:03,271
No sir.

726
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:04,732
Whether she loves me or not,

727
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,403
l'll live in her memories till death.

728
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,348
Fate is powerful.

729
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:16,051
l just slapped my wife
for pocket money.

730
00:59:16,653 --> 00:59:18,280
She put me in jail on dowry charge.

731
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:18,954
lt's a lie.

732
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,782
What did he do at this age?

733
00:59:21,991 --> 00:59:22,958
Don't you know him?

734
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:24,558
He has appeared in Sun TV channel too.

735
00:59:25,028 --> 00:59:26,495
Ask him his name?

736
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,091
Saint Ambalavana Swamigal.

737
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,967
That's why his sitting
posture is different.

738
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,227
What did Ambalavanar do?

739
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:36,096
Ask him what he didn't do?

740
00:59:36,706 --> 00:59:38,833
He went to North to sell cereals.

741
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:42,633
This beard fellow sold cereals
by speaking Tamil language.

742
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:44,606
Since his looks & language
was different,

743
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,439
they took him to be a saint.

744
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,148
This saint never kept quiet.

745
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,276
He harassed many women
including foreign girls.

746
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:52,720
He could've stay put with that.

747
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,483
A 10th std. girl.

748
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,586
She went to get his blessings
before going to Examination.

749
00:59:58,127 --> 00:59:58,786
He harassed her too.

750
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:00,589
You stinking shit!

751
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:02,593
Your story has gone to dogs.

752
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,523
They accepted you as a saint.

753
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:07,136
lnstead of eating the apples &
oranges they offered you,

754
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:08,235
& keeping everything hush-hush,

755
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:09,530
you indulged in sex,

756
01:00:11,374 --> 01:00:11,931
and you're laughing.

757
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,504
You could do this only in lndia.

758
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,671
lf you had sold
your cereals in Dubai...

759
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:24,476
My son.

760
01:00:27,724 --> 01:00:29,624
What's it father? We are all the
birds of the same feather.

761
01:00:38,735 --> 01:00:39,201
Hello!

762
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,444
He's biting me.
- lt's alright, my son.

763
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,010
Alright? l'll slipper you.

764
01:01:08,531 --> 01:01:10,089
Slowly. lt might slip & fall down.

765
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,767
l'm telling you.

766
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:15,763
lf he had hit the policemen,

767
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,599
does that mean, he's a
big shot? Go & tell him.

768
01:05:07,837 --> 01:05:08,633
Lock him up.

769
01:06:30,086 --> 01:06:30,882
Cremator!

770
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:32,054
Beat him to pulp.

771
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:18,563
Lift him.

772
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,236
Get me some water.

773
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:41,154
lt's nothing...nothing.

774
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:43,918
Sleep....sleep. They are not here.

775
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:44,751
Sleep.

776
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,273
lf you keep beating
& biting everyone,

777
01:07:58,474 --> 01:07:59,771
they'll never ever release you.

778
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:02,272
Once you come here,

779
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,946
eat well, build your body and go out.

780
01:08:19,662 --> 01:08:20,629
There he is.

781
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:21,455
Swamiji!

782
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:23,020
How are you Jennifer?- l'm fine.

783
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,996
Sakthi.- Come here.

784
01:08:26,669 --> 01:08:27,966
Sakthi, are you fine?

785
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:29,797
Seal your affection in a box
& get me the beedi.

786
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:36,741
You know her, don't you?

787
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,414
l know. She's Gomathi who
sells drugs, isn't she?

788
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:41,242
Why are you shouting?

789
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,480
Why is his face swollen?

790
01:08:48,023 --> 01:08:49,650
He should've been quiet.

791
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:51,986
Buddy, he dipped me in
the Gravy vessel.

792
01:08:52,194 --> 01:08:53,320
Shit! Are you not ashamed?

793
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,827
Will the Jailer spare him
if he beats him?

794
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:56,497
Look here.

795
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:57,823
l was beaten on the
day l came here.

796
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:00,498
What were your men doing
when you were being beaten?

797
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,330
He's hitting us in a
different way.

798
01:09:02,771 --> 01:09:06,332
Will everyone be like me?
- You know nothing about him.

799
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:10,170
He was born & brought up
in cemetery. Poor guy!

800
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:22,157
Hail Lord Ambala...

801
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:26,695
You shit! l'm going to crush you.

802
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,596
Do it silently.

803
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:34,268
Oh! ls he like this because of that?

804
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:37,098
Do something. Come in &
save my honor.

805
01:09:37,306 --> 01:09:39,604
This can't go for long.
l'll take care as long as l'm here.

806
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:41,435
Arrange to take him on bail.

807
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:47,347
Jennifer, l love you.
- l love you too. Take care.

808
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:48,813
You're a lucky man...

809
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:49,985
Go....go.

810
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:59,049
Oh my god! l'm unable to go out of
the station peacefully leaving her here.

811
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,229
She always gets into trouble.

812
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,556
Why should it bother you if
someone sells something?

813
01:10:02,765 --> 01:10:05,734
You went to watch a movie.
You could've watched it & come home.

814
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:08,562
l can't live like others.

815
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:13,571
This Manju will punish anyone
who commits a mistake.

816
01:10:16,445 --> 01:10:17,571
Oh my god!

817
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:20,811
Did we had to do the penance at
Tirupathi hill to give birth to you?

818
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,753
Useless girl!- l don't care.

819
01:10:24,954 --> 01:10:27,752
But one thing,
l'll come home with an award.

820
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:30,084
No one should touch that.
- Shut up.

821
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,585
l am worried about what he'll do
after coming out of the jail,

822
01:10:33,796 --> 01:10:35,093
and you're talking
about getting an award.

823
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,773
Hey cheat!- Call me Sakthi.

824
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,599
Okay, come. Someone has
come to see you.

825
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,274
Why are you coming here often?

826
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,606
Come inside, if your affection
for me is over-flowing.

827
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:55,446
Polytechnic.- Doctor...

828
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:05,216
l ask your forgiveness for giving
birth to this useless girl.

829
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:09,222
Please forget all those things.

830
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,238
Have you finished asking for
forgiveness? Let's go.

831
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,065
Wait. We elders are
talking, aren't we?

832
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:19,241
You talkative girl!

833
01:11:19,475 --> 01:11:21,238
You're still adamant after
committing all the mistakes.

834
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:24,572
When l came to know about
the incident,

835
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,247
l was clue less.

836
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:28,412
l've lost my peace of mind
because of her.

837
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,244
Just say you've forgiven me.

838
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:31,919
Only then, l can live
in peace. Please...

839
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,087
lt's all right....

840
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,085
Father!

841
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,258
You're repeatedly begging to a fraud.

842
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,228
What happened? Why are you crying?

843
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:46,731
l didn't feel bad for
being put in the jail.

844
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:51,235
She's calling me a fraud again
& again. How can l bear it?

845
01:11:56,545 --> 01:12:00,345
l don't know to which god am
l'm going to tell all this.

846
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:03,184
Don't cry...Don't cry.

847
01:12:03,886 --> 01:12:05,513
Sir...Sir...

848
01:12:06,121 --> 01:12:09,249
Look, he's crying.

849
01:12:10,793 --> 01:12:12,761
lf you hurt others, can you be happy?

850
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:18,763
Seek his pardon...Seek his pardon.

851
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:20,260
Father.

852
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:22,602
Have you gone mad?

853
01:12:23,972 --> 01:12:26,600
Yes, because l gave birth
to you, isn't it?

854
01:12:26,809 --> 01:12:29,277
lt's all right, seek his pardon.
- l won't.

855
01:12:29,478 --> 01:12:31,776
Why?

856
01:12:31,980 --> 01:12:33,607
Father, you don't know about him.

857
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:36,449
He cheated me by rolling the dice.

858
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:39,787
He's a big fraud.

859
01:12:39,988 --> 01:12:40,784
Hey.

860
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,955
lt's a last chance for you.
- Tell me.

861
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:48,163
Rs.400 which you grabbed
from me fraudulently.

862
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:51,095
And my H.M.T Watch.

863
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:54,534
Then the fine amount of Rs.500
which l paid in the train.

864
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,331
Then, l spent Rs.75 for coming here.

865
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,336
lf you agree to return
the amount l've spent,

866
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,168
l'll get you released.

867
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:04,005
Oh God, Are you really an educated girl?

868
01:13:04,213 --> 01:13:05,339
Or you're simply roaming around
wearing pant and shirt?

869
01:13:05,981 --> 01:13:08,176
Are you the President to order
my release?

870
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:09,239
Why not?

871
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:12,179
Did they catch you?
l handed you over to them.

872
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,515
Are these beatings not enough for you?

873
01:13:14,723 --> 01:13:19,023
Sir, what's this?
l was washing my clothes.

874
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,526
You called me & irritated me.

875
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:22,856
Beat her nicely & take her away.

876
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:24,362
Hey, what did you say?

877
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,869
A woman can do anything,
do you know?

878
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:30,864
Hey, look at me.

879
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,372
lf l don't show my mercy on you
you'll die here itself.

880
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,708
Hey, what are you looking at?

881
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,048
Sir, you go outside.

882
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:47,380
Hey.

883
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,057
lf you don't show mercy on me,
won't l get release?

884
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:53,554
You're proudly saying,
''l only caught you''.

885
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,323
That day, l was carrying you
on my back, right?

886
01:13:58,934 --> 01:14:02,097
How much time would it have taken me
to remove your skirt & run away?

887
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:09,508
l didn't get this idea now.

888
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:11,071
l got this idea that day itself.

889
01:14:11,613 --> 01:14:14,639
They say, ''Women's curse will not
go in vain''. That's why, l left you.

890
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,513
Understood?- Yes.

891
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,950
My son! This is a sin.
- Go to hell man.

892
01:14:57,092 --> 01:14:58,252
He has ruined a small girl's life,

893
01:14:58,427 --> 01:14:59,052
and calling me a sinner?

894
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:07,398
Move away....Move...

895
01:15:08,103 --> 01:15:10,401
Leave it, brother.
Why should we get in trouble?

896
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:11,903
Leave me, this has become
common here.

897
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:21,007
No...Leave him.

898
01:15:24,253 --> 01:15:25,686
Listen to me...Leave him.

899
01:15:27,556 --> 01:15:28,682
l say leave him.

900
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:38,024
No.

901
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:44,695
Leave him....l say leave him.

902
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:49,537
Hey, jailer will come...Stop it.

903
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:53,906
Get on feet quickly!

904
01:15:59,755 --> 01:16:01,052
He has come...Be calm.

905
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:03,387
Hey, lets go.

906
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:08,726
What's going on here?

907
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:12,396
Sir, it's nothing.

908
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:14,569
Then, why are you both rolling?

909
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:18,567
l was trying to brief him how to fight.

910
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:20,241
You? - Yes, sir.

911
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:21,406
Briefing him!

912
01:16:22,945 --> 01:16:23,673
Bring him.

913
01:16:24,146 --> 01:16:26,114
sir....sir.

914
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,545
You'll reform only if l brief you.

915
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,717
Sir, l swear. We were just practising.

916
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:31,545
You arrogant fellow.
- Sir, l swear.

917
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:42,929
Sir, why have you put me
in the dark room?

918
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:44,395
Oh God!

919
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,398
Sir, it pains.

920
01:16:47,502 --> 01:16:52,132
Sir, please leave me.
...forgive me.

921
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:58,073
Sir, it's paining.
Leave me.

922
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,577
Sir, please leave me.

923
01:17:38,620 --> 01:18:35,201
TAMILINI

924
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:42,914
Who's he who has woken up
my slumbering heart?

925
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:52,457
My soul is seeking his identity
& his whereabouts.

926
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:59,931
When the cuckoo was in wilderness,

927
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:06,433
and when it was unaware
of the ways of the world,

928
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:15,105
did you come as its companion?

929
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:22,353
Will you be with it
for its entire life?

930
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:28,696
Who's he who has woken up
my slumbering heart?

931
01:19:29,498 --> 01:19:45,973
TAMILINI

932
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:05,990
Where were we yesterday?
And today we are here.

933
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:12,162
The future is not in our hands.

934
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:15,943
Were we destined to face
all that had happened?

935
01:20:16,211 --> 01:20:19,510
Or all this is happening,
because of our destiny?

936
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:22,683
We are ignorant about it.

937
01:20:30,892 --> 01:20:31,790
l'll take leave.

938
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,228
Chitthan, l can't stay here,
even if l wish to.

939
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:44,071
lf they release me,
l've to go out.

940
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:46,901
Only 10 days, okay?

941
01:20:49,211 --> 01:20:49,905
Bye.

942
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:58,853
My son...my son.

943
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:10,223
Hey, put it out.
He's about to come.

944
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:12,898
You're getting tensed as if
it's school admission for you.

945
01:21:13,101 --> 01:21:14,068
ls he a master?

946
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,237
l should'nt smoke in front you, my sister.

947
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:18,738
You've fixed him with a nice person.

948
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:20,908
Hey, get up...He has come.

949
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:28,176
Greetings, sir.
- Gomathi, what's it?

950
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:30,179
Who are you?
- Tell him, sister.

951
01:21:30,719 --> 01:21:32,687
Sakthi.
He was with Chitthan in the jail.

952
01:21:33,121 --> 01:21:33,917
What do you want now?

953
01:21:34,422 --> 01:21:36,083
lt's been 3 months.

954
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,919
lt's a surprise that he has been
able to stay there so long.

955
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,254
That's why, l want to bail him out.

956
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:42,760
You're very casual about it.

957
01:21:42,964 --> 01:21:44,261
lt will cost you 2-3 lakhs,
do you know?

958
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,100
So what?

959
01:21:46,301 --> 01:21:47,598
He has gone to jail,
for your sake, right?

960
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:50,466
Hey, how many persons have
you told this?

961
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,373
Till now, no one.

962
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:54,701
lf you refuse to bail him out,
l'll not spare you.

963
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,707
Keep quiet...What's all this?
- You be quiet.

964
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:57,879
Go.- You beg to him if you want.

965
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:04,110
Hey Mahadeva, make
arrangements for his bail.

966
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:05,650
l'll give you one day's time.

967
01:22:05,820 --> 01:22:09,950
Otherwise l'll reveal everything
to the judge. Be careful.

968
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:14,118
Hey, go man.
- Take care of your, Cannabis fields.

969
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:19,563
Gomathi, what's all this?

970
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:24,999
That day, you asked for a
job for an orphan.

971
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,802
And today, someone has come
on behalf of him

972
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,277
lf he does anything even for fun,
do you know it's consequences?

973
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:34,738
Sir, don't mistake him.
He talked like that out of affection.

974
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:39,080
lf you be merciful & get him released,
l'll be grateful to you.

975
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:43,690
Okay, l'll do the needful.

976
01:22:44,759 --> 01:22:47,853
But one thing, don't allow him to be
friendly with such touts.

977
01:22:49,230 --> 01:22:51,027
Are we doing a legal business?

978
01:22:53,401 --> 01:22:54,197
Go.

979
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:04,601
Come fast...
Let's go for a ride.

980
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:39,069
lt's me.

981
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:52,927
That's it.

982
01:24:14,015 --> 01:24:15,277
Hello....- Leave my hand.

983
01:24:15,683 --> 01:24:16,445
Give me my watch.

984
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:29,957
Shall l go?- Go.

985
01:24:31,666 --> 01:24:35,625
l went to jail because of you.
But you're not talking to me.

986
01:24:35,837 --> 01:24:38,806
How can l talk here?
lf someone see us.

987
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:42,469
Let them see.
You don't care for anyone.

988
01:24:42,677 --> 01:24:44,975
Stop it...l've changed now.

989
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:48,477
lt's evident by seeing you.
- What do you see?

990
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:52,313
You look more beautiful than before.

991
01:24:54,022 --> 01:24:55,819
Thanks..next.

992
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:59,157
Nice fragrance!
Which soap do you use?

993
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:01,662
Oh no! l'm feeling shy.

994
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,164
Did you ever think of me?- No.

995
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,166
You're lying.
You must've dreamt about me.

996
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:11,664
How do you know?

997
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:14,669
Since l dreamt in that
mosquito infested cell,

998
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:18,543
wouldn't you've dreamt in your house
which has many air-conditioners?

999
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:22,341
What did you dream?
- l won't tell you.

1000
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:26,017
lf you tell me,
l'll give you something.

1001
01:25:26,521 --> 01:25:27,180
What's it?

1002
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:29,547
Wow! Puffed rice ball.

1003
01:25:30,058 --> 01:25:32,026
Manju dear.- l'm coming dad.

1004
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,360
Let's talk tomorrow.
- Tomorrow you've college.

1005
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:37,857
Oh God, l'll say 'fever' &
come to the milk farm.

1006
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:38,691
We'll talk.

1007
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,366
See you.- Bye.

1008
01:25:50,078 --> 01:25:52,706
Who's to be bailed out?
- Chitthan.

1009
01:25:54,749 --> 01:25:55,716
How do you know him?

1010
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:57,384
We worked together.

1011
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:02,549
He's a smuggler of Cannabis.

1012
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,224
Are you also in the same profession?

1013
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:05,050
No...

1014
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:10,055
lf he doesn't appear in the court,
you'll be arrested, do you know?

1015
01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:11,324
Okay.

1016
01:26:11,933 --> 01:26:14,629
Sign a bail bond for
Rs.3 lakhs, and take him.

1017
01:26:25,213 --> 01:26:27,340
Hey, Chitthan.

1018
01:26:48,269 --> 01:26:50,430
Am l a crow to put stones
into this & drink?

1019
01:26:50,638 --> 01:26:51,161
Pour some more.

1020
01:26:51,406 --> 01:26:53,169
That's enough.
We can't bear your tortures.

1021
01:26:53,341 --> 01:26:54,933
Old monk will not
have any effect.

1022
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:04,647
Oh my friend!
You're my soul.

1023
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:09,221
Don't think l'm blabbering
because l'm drunk.

1024
01:27:10,892 --> 01:27:15,420
l like you more than Manju.

1025
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:18,593
Reduce your volume.
She might over hear you.

1026
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:19,767
Let her hear.

1027
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:21,497
You get lost.

1028
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:28,933
l was eagerly waiting for you.

1029
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:32,004
Happy!

1030
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,480
But l don't like one thing about you.

1031
01:27:39,053 --> 01:27:40,543
You don't smile.

1032
01:27:41,623 --> 01:27:42,248
Smile...

1033
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:44,692
Smile...

1034
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:47,556
Smile...

1035
01:27:48,630 --> 01:27:50,962
l'll start crying
if you don't smile.

1036
01:27:52,066 --> 01:27:52,691
Cry.....

1037
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:55,369
Cry....

1038
01:27:56,404 --> 01:27:58,031
Cry....

1039
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:03,376
He seems to be crying.

1040
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:13,053
Kiss.....Kiss....

1041
01:28:19,927 --> 01:28:22,760
You scoundrels! At last, you
made me to stay hungry.

1042
01:28:22,964 --> 01:28:24,795
Gomathi might've cooked something
to eat. We'll ask her.

1043
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:27,968
Ask her! Do you want to be beaten by her?
Shut up & sleep here.

1044
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:32,902
What happened?

1045
01:28:33,274 --> 01:28:34,605
Hey, What happened?

1046
01:28:35,443 --> 01:28:37,843
Sakthi....Sakthi....

1047
01:28:38,846 --> 01:28:39,972
Sakthi....

1048
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:43,584
What shit did you drink?
You stink!

1049
01:28:43,785 --> 01:28:45,685
Monk...- What?

1050
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:47,218
Old Monk.

1051
01:28:47,922 --> 01:28:52,086
Don't you've any sense? You know, it
doesn't suit him. Why did you give him?

1052
01:28:54,462 --> 01:28:57,226
Oh God! l'm going to leave you all.

1053
01:28:57,432 --> 01:28:57,921
Shit!

1054
01:28:58,132 --> 01:28:59,724
You should've drunk within your limit.

1055
01:29:00,201 --> 01:29:01,896
Hey, did you eat?

1056
01:29:02,103 --> 01:29:02,592
Who's it?

1057
01:29:02,804 --> 01:29:04,431
Sakthi, did you eat?

1058
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:06,436
Who's it?

1059
01:29:06,641 --> 01:29:08,165
lt's me. Did you eat?

1060
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:09,206
Who's it?

1061
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:12,777
l'm asking you, did you eat?
Tell me, did you eat?

1062
01:29:19,420 --> 01:29:20,546
What did l do?

1063
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:22,052
He's sleeping on empty stomach.

1064
01:29:22,256 --> 01:29:23,245
So, l'm trying to wake him up.
Why did you beat me?

1065
01:29:26,594 --> 01:29:29,529
You're not allowing me to touch him.
Go to hell.

1066
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,483
Enough.

1067
01:30:20,481 --> 01:30:21,448
You eat.

1068
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:24,278
You eat.

1069
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:30,619
You eat.

1070
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:47,134
TAMILINI

1071
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:50,468
Cool breeze is blowing.

1072
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:53,841
lt sounds like music.

1073
01:30:54,048 --> 01:31:07,155
TAMILINI

1074
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:13,298
lt's flowing through bamboos
& creating music.

1075
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:16,728
The clouds are listening to it.

1076
01:31:17,472 --> 01:31:23,672
A peacock is spreading it's
feathers in a stone heart.

1077
01:31:24,045 --> 01:31:26,741
lt's drizzling.

1078
01:31:26,948 --> 01:31:40,123
The grass has laid a path
& the rainbow has become an umbrella.

1079
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:47,326
The doors of the heart are opening,
hearing the sound of the bell.

1080
01:31:47,802 --> 01:31:53,035
The body is floating in the air
with new vibrations.

1081
01:32:10,758 --> 01:32:48,020
TAMILINI

1082
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:54,599
Like the threads woven together,
to make a beautiful cloth,

1083
01:32:54,802 --> 01:33:01,139
We are woven together
with the bond of love.

1084
01:33:04,979 --> 01:33:11,282
Like the mother earth which
pampers & give us food to live,

1085
01:33:11,485 --> 01:33:14,477
only a few are blessed
with such noble hearts.

1086
01:33:14,689 --> 01:33:17,783
& this world still exists
because of them.

1087
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:24,192
Till yesterday, l was alone with
no one around me.

1088
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:27,796
lf someone accompanies you
in the journey of your life,

1089
01:33:28,002 --> 01:33:30,800
it's the best deal one can get.

1090
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:36,804
Nothing is solo in this world.

1091
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:42,780
Flute is accompanied by music
& flowers are accompanied by fragrance.

1092
01:33:59,867 --> 01:34:34,000
TAMILINI

1093
01:34:34,368 --> 01:34:38,327
The heart is like the sky.

1094
01:34:38,539 --> 01:34:40,871
lt gives you riddles everyday.

1095
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:48,204
No one knows the secret.
No one understands this mystery.

1096
01:34:51,852 --> 01:34:57,882
The hand that sows the seeds,
also plucks the flowers.

1097
01:34:58,092 --> 01:35:04,520
Who made a garland
of those flowers?

1098
01:35:04,732 --> 01:35:10,898
Parrots swing holding
the aerial roots,

1099
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:17,637
and are gently narrating stories.

1100
01:35:18,012 --> 01:35:23,507
Before asking for a lullaby,

1101
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:29,679
the young jackal runs
in search of mother jackal.

1102
01:37:32,112 --> 01:37:33,079
Don't beat me.

1103
01:37:36,784 --> 01:37:38,012
l'm from Police department.

1104
01:37:38,219 --> 01:37:38,708
Get lost.

1105
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:44,984
He's from the police department.
He was spying on us.

1106
01:37:53,067 --> 01:37:54,091
Whenever we get into trouble,

1107
01:37:54,301 --> 01:37:55,598
it's he who had blown the whistle on us.

1108
01:37:58,305 --> 01:37:59,704
You've not only got our
goods seized,

1109
01:37:59,907 --> 01:38:01,169
you've also found our place.

1110
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:08,240
l struggle very hard to send
the goods every month.

1111
01:38:09,183 --> 01:38:12,516
And you phone & inform someone
without any strain.

1112
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:17,286
Where's the phone?
- Who wants that phone?

1113
01:38:17,691 --> 01:38:19,886
Take him inside.
l'll eat & come.

1114
01:38:21,195 --> 01:38:22,719
Go. You scoundrel!

1115
01:38:23,464 --> 01:38:27,127
You earn small salary, but you've given
very heavy loss to the boss.

1116
01:38:27,334 --> 01:38:27,959
Useless fellow!

1117
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:11,272
lf we bother about things & morality,
we can't eke our livelihood.

1118
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:12,737
Wash it.

1119
01:39:13,514 --> 01:39:14,139
Hey....

1120
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:18,875
Take this & burn it
in a remote place.

1121
01:39:22,389 --> 01:39:24,857
Think who you're.

1122
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:29,023
Tell me, what's yours in this world?

1123
01:39:29,229 --> 01:39:31,595
Parents are for the time being...

1124
01:39:32,299 --> 01:39:35,928
Your wife is for the time being...

1125
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:38,461
Your job is for the time being...

1126
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:43,073
Luxurious bungalow is for
the time being...

1127
01:39:44,244 --> 01:39:46,678
Reservoir & service
are for time being.

1128
01:40:09,937 --> 01:40:10,961
Do you've any sense?

1129
01:40:12,072 --> 01:40:13,300
Do you know what you've done?

1130
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:16,873
He never realises...

1131
01:40:17,077 --> 01:40:18,601
What are you discussing so vehemently?

1132
01:40:18,812 --> 01:40:20,609
You Karuppan! get me 2 pots of water.

1133
01:40:28,756 --> 01:40:30,189
Will you do anything he orders?

1134
01:40:36,997 --> 01:40:38,362
You Karuppan, come here.

1135
01:40:38,866 --> 01:40:40,128
She's calling you, isn't she? Go.

1136
01:40:51,311 --> 01:40:52,437
What's this?

1137
01:40:52,646 --> 01:40:54,273
Your shirt is full of blood.
What did you do?

1138
01:40:54,481 --> 01:40:56,039
Whom did you kill & bury?

1139
01:40:56,250 --> 01:40:59,686
lt's nothing. Go.
- His shirt is full of blood.

1140
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:01,787
Tell me whose corpse did you carry?

1141
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:06,289
Why are you shouting now? Get up.
Go inside. Go....

1142
01:41:06,493 --> 01:41:09,621
Oh God! He has done something terrible.
At least you go & ask him.- l know.

1143
01:41:09,830 --> 01:41:10,797
He has done nothing.

1144
01:41:10,998 --> 01:41:13,466
Someone else did it. He burnt it.
That's all.

1145
01:41:13,667 --> 01:41:14,463
That's all!

1146
01:41:14,668 --> 01:41:15,794
You're saying so cooly.

1147
01:41:16,003 --> 01:41:18,130
Will he go to jail again?
- No.

1148
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:19,567
l told you, he didn't do it.

1149
01:41:19,773 --> 01:41:21,138
Then, who did it?- Don't shout.

1150
01:41:21,675 --> 01:41:23,973
The one whom you put him up for a job.

1151
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:25,304
l sent him to work.

1152
01:41:25,612 --> 01:41:27,637
l never thought that he'll
do anything those murderers would say.

1153
01:41:27,848 --> 01:41:29,645
He has ruined his life.

1154
01:41:30,017 --> 01:41:30,984
What's the use of mourning now?

1155
01:41:31,185 --> 01:41:31,981
Where were your senses then?

1156
01:41:32,352 --> 01:41:33,478
Don't curse me.

1157
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:35,818
The day l got him a job with them,

1158
01:41:36,023 --> 01:41:37,388
l lost my peace.

1159
01:41:39,193 --> 01:41:42,424
l had a hunch that something will go
wrong when he went yesterday, l knew...

1160
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:45,088
Do one thing.
Take him to the police station.

1161
01:41:45,299 --> 01:41:46,732
And tell them that we are in no way
related to that crime.

1162
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:48,391
Do you want to expose
everything yourself?

1163
01:41:48,702 --> 01:41:50,101
Nothing will happen, keep quiet.

1164
01:41:50,471 --> 01:41:53,599
Don't talk irrelevantly,
he's innocent.

1165
01:41:53,874 --> 01:41:54,499
lf this matter leaks out,

1166
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:57,609
Do you want to see the police beating
& dragging him on the streets?

1167
01:42:03,217 --> 01:42:04,514
Don't cry & mourn so loudly.

1168
01:42:04,718 --> 01:42:05,844
The entire village might
come to know about it.

1169
01:42:06,220 --> 01:42:07,187
lf they catch him for the crime
committed by someone else,

1170
01:42:07,387 --> 01:42:08,354
do you think we'll keep quite?

1171
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:11,686
Look, law says that the one who exhorts
to do the crime is the first accused,

1172
01:42:11,892 --> 01:42:13,689
& not the one who does it.

1173
01:42:14,795 --> 01:42:16,160
Nothing will happen.

1174
01:42:19,366 --> 01:42:21,163
He's full of mud & ash.
Go & give him bath.

1175
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:25,931
Throw it down. Get up...
Get up & take bath.

1176
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,607
Add turmeric & pour on him.

1177
01:42:27,808 --> 01:42:28,832
Let his sins get washed away.

1178
01:42:30,544 --> 01:42:31,772
Why are you taking that?

1179
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:33,241
Lets throw them in the fire
& burn them.

1180
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:13,311
Don't move.

1181
01:43:24,198 --> 01:43:24,664
How's it?

1182
01:43:27,467 --> 01:43:27,933
Smile.

1183
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:42,174
Gomathi, look. He's smiling.
Karuppan, uncle come here.

1184
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:44,350
Look, he's smiling.

1185
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,116
You're smiling nicely.

1186
01:43:50,324 --> 01:43:51,018
Enough.

1187
01:43:51,725 --> 01:43:56,185
You blabber a lot.
Teach him.

1188
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:57,693
Atleast, let him smile.

1189
01:43:58,498 --> 01:44:00,295
But don't teach him your
tricks & mal-practises.

1190
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:00,966
What's this sister?

1191
01:44:01,168 --> 01:44:02,192
You said you're going
to leave this drug business.

1192
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:03,198
Then how can l continue?

1193
01:44:03,403 --> 01:44:05,530
Lying & bluffing will end
with my generation.

1194
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:07,036
Sakthi, don't commit in a hurry.

1195
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:08,538
l can't stay hungry.
- Look at him.

1196
01:44:08,742 --> 01:44:10,209
Why are you always after food?

1197
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:10,967
What bothers you?

1198
01:44:11,178 --> 01:44:12,543
lf you eat a few grains & drink water,

1199
01:44:12,746 --> 01:44:14,373
your hunger will subside.
But l'm different.

1200
01:44:14,581 --> 01:44:16,208
l told you to chuck him out.
But you never listened.

1201
01:44:16,416 --> 01:44:20,216
Don't fight...Go...

1202
01:44:24,925 --> 01:44:26,483
Wow! this too.

1203
01:44:35,369 --> 01:44:38,167
Paari brought a chariot.
Girls brought dowry.

1204
01:44:38,372 --> 01:44:39,339
A friend in need,
is a friend indeed.

1205
01:44:39,539 --> 01:44:41,166
We've brought pens.

1206
01:44:42,042 --> 01:44:42,838
Say that again.

1207

What do you see up there all day?

1208
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:48,173
Don't stare at me, talk.

1209
01:44:49,883 --> 01:44:51,851
We paint with our hands.
We speak with our mouth.

1210
01:44:52,052 --> 01:44:55,351
Come on say... lt'll keep on writing.

01:44:58,058 --> 01:44:58,524
Yes.

1213
01:44:58,725 --> 01:45:01,193
You Karuppan, come.- Sakthi, come.

01:45:01,395 --> 01:45:02,362
Hey stop.- Come fast.

Karuppan, it's actress Simran.

1217
01:45:19,313 --> 01:45:20,041
Silence please.

1218
01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:24,283
What different character?

1219
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:27,453

1221
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:37,293
A thick forest & a saint.
...With long hair.

1222
01:45:37,664 --> 01:45:38,790
He has a water jug in his hand.

1223
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,964
They are the one who live in forest
wearing ''saffron dress''.

1224
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:42,635
Saint.

1225
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:44,971
Saint.

1226
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:47,807
Sakthi, we stitch the clothes
& then wear them.

1227
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:49,635
Look there, they are wearing them
& getting them stitched.

1228
01:45:51,178 --> 01:45:53,078
Shall l come to put the thread
into the needle?

1229
01:45:54,681 --> 01:45:56,740
Come on, look at us.
Take your hands off.

1230
01:45:56,950 --> 01:45:58,975
Beware! l'll burst a cracker
in your mouth.- Listen to me.

1231
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:00,813
You're shooting in our village
& chasing us out!

1232
01:46:01,188 --> 01:46:03,315
l'll spread the rumour that the actress
is out of doors.

1233
01:46:03,523 --> 01:46:04,820
What's this?- Get lost.

1234
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:08,825
Oh no! What's that noise?

1235
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:12,328
Hey Hanuman, chase them out.
- They are not going.

1236
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:13,396
Go away.

1237
01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:14,391
Who's he?

1238
01:46:14,601 --> 01:46:16,228
He's wearing a cap, so,
he's the director.

1239
01:46:17,537 --> 01:46:19,368
He's shouting too much.- Yes.

1240
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:24,010
Madam, you go & change your
costume.

1241

Later l'll tell the...
- Okay sir...Okay sir.

You must learn Tamil language.

1243
01:46:30,717 --> 01:46:33,845
Or else l must learn English
& make English films.

1244
01:46:38,892 --> 01:46:39,620
Hey go.

1245
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:42,191
What are you doing? Leave her.

1246
01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:43,790
Who are you?- Take the car.

1247
01:46:43,997 --> 01:46:45,021
Who are you?

1248
01:46:49,736 --> 01:46:51,704
Cigarette... cigarette.

1249
01:46:51,905 --> 01:46:55,204
Lets all turn into ashes.

1250
01:46:55,909 --> 01:46:57,206
Chant 'Hare Krishna Hare Ram'
in the morning & in the evening.

1251
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:01,040
Hare Krishna Hare Ram

1252
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,374
What's going on here?

1253
01:47:02,749 --> 01:47:04,717
You stupid! Why are you
behaving like this?

1254
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:06,044
Why are you keeping quiet?

1255
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:07,220
One second madam.

1256
01:47:07,454 --> 01:47:09,854
Hey switch off the phone.
l'll cut your neck.

1257
01:47:10,257 --> 01:47:12,452
l'll kill you if you
phone anyone.

1258
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:13,718
Did you see?

1259
01:47:13,994 --> 01:47:16,485
l told you l didn't want to
shoot in this village, didn't l?

1260
01:47:16,763 --> 01:47:18,731
lf we had given these
dates to Director Maniratnam.

1261
01:47:18,932 --> 01:47:20,229
We could've finished the
song in 'Ladakh'.

1262
01:47:20,434 --> 01:47:22,402
No madam. Director wanted to
shoot in the forest.

1263
01:47:22,936 --> 01:47:26,064
Big forest! ls he directing
Jurassic park?

1264
01:47:26,273 --> 01:47:28,468
ls he a director?
bald headed fellow.

1265
01:47:28,775 --> 01:47:31,243
l'm in this situation
because of him.

1266
01:47:31,778 --> 01:47:35,407
lf he comes in future asking for dates,
l'll slipper him.

1267
01:47:36,783 --> 01:47:38,910
l hate this...l hate this.

1268
01:47:39,219 --> 01:47:42,586
What's this? Why are you
talking continuously?

1269
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:45,087
Shut up. Country brutes.

1270
01:47:45,392 --> 01:47:48,088
Keep quiet. We've kidnapped you but
we are not going to rape you.

1271
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:51,264
What?...Rape?!

1272
01:47:51,631 --> 01:47:54,099
Did you see?...- Madam.

1273
01:47:55,402 --> 01:47:56,494
Look, what they are saying?

1274
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:58,999
l'm going to shoot them all.

1275
01:47:59,206 --> 01:48:03,267
Wow! 'Simran is an angry girl'
published in a magazine is true.

1276
01:48:04,811 --> 01:48:07,439
You don't know about me.
Better let me get down.

1277
01:48:07,981 --> 01:48:10,108
You don't know what you're doing.

1278
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:12,384
Shut up.- What shut up!

1279
01:48:12,586 --> 01:48:14,281
See...- What should l see?

1280
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,615
See here...See there..

1281
01:48:24,097 --> 01:48:24,620
Shit.

1282
01:48:25,432 --> 01:48:30,893
Oh villagers! Listen to
this announcement,

1283
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:34,130
The girl who has left many
young & old men sleepless,

1284
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:35,638
South lndian star...

1285
01:48:35,842 --> 01:48:39,141
With a tentalising waist,
Simran is coming.

1286
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:42,648
Come...Madam, come & see.
it's Simran.

1287
01:48:42,849 --> 01:48:43,975
Why are you walking slowly? Come.

1288
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:48,654
Without food this man is
roaming on the cycle.

1289
01:48:48,855 --> 01:48:50,948
All of them become
dull after seeing his face.

1290
01:48:51,157 --> 01:48:55,560
Come & dance here.
- What? Dance? ldiots!

1291
01:48:59,699 --> 01:49:01,496
Why are you torturing me like this?

1292
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:04,164
Doesn't anyone has sense?

1293
01:49:04,371 --> 01:49:05,770
Madam, why are you
talking like this?

1294
01:49:05,972 --> 01:49:06,996
To tempt us to buy the soap,

1295
01:49:07,207 --> 01:49:09,004
you're giving an Ad announcing that
you're taking bath 27 times.

1296
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:11,336
Can't you dance for
making us happy?

1297
01:49:11,545 --> 01:49:15,675
How fair she is. lt seems
she takes bath in donkey's milk.

1298
01:49:16,483 --> 01:49:18,451
What is she saying?
- She is saying you look beautiful.

1299
01:49:18,652 --> 01:49:21,018
And she said that you take bath
in donkey's milk.

1300
01:49:21,221 --> 01:49:23,018
Say 'No'.- No...

1301
01:49:23,223 --> 01:49:25,521
Simran madam, why is your hair brown?

1302
01:49:25,725 --> 01:49:28,193
You earn so much can't
you apply coconut oil on them?

1303
01:49:29,162 --> 01:49:30,527
Madam, regarding your hair...

1304
01:49:30,897 --> 01:49:32,194
They say you're earning so much,

1305
01:49:32,499 --> 01:49:34,865
Can't you apply coconut oil?
- Shit!

1306
01:49:36,736 --> 01:49:38,135
Leave me l'll go...

1307
01:49:38,338 --> 01:49:42,536
Hey! Why are you in a hurry?

1308
01:49:42,742 --> 01:49:44,642
You're right. Did we ask
money from you?

1309
01:49:44,911 --> 01:49:46,208
We've seen you in
T.V & theaters.

1310
01:49:46,413 --> 01:49:46,879
You've come here as Goddess,

1311
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,707
what are you going to lose
if you dance here?

1312
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:51,713
What are you seeing man?
Translate it to her...

1313
01:49:52,252 --> 01:49:53,879
They are saying you've come
like Goddess.

1314
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:55,714
And they are asking you to dance.

1315
01:49:57,591 --> 01:49:58,888
Madam, why are you hesitating?

1316
01:49:59,092 --> 01:50:01,617
Even Mahatma Gandhi has
come to this place.

1317
01:50:02,095 --> 01:50:04,063
When did he come?
- Hey you be quiet.

1318
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:07,396
They say Gandhiji came here
spending his pocket money.

1319
01:50:07,867 --> 01:50:09,892
Oh really?
- Yes...Yes.

1320
01:50:11,271 --> 01:50:12,568
lf you dance here,

1321
01:50:12,872 --> 01:50:16,069
we'll definitely elect you as
Minister in the next election.

1322
01:50:16,943 --> 01:50:19,173
lf you dance here, they'll
elect you as minister.

1323
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:27,412
Madam, look here...

1324
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:30,415
These people have become very old,

1325
01:50:30,624 --> 01:50:33,422
before they die, if they
see your dance,

1326
01:50:33,627 --> 01:50:35,754
lt'll be imprinted in their life history.

1327
01:50:35,962 --> 01:50:38,590
Before they die, they want
to see your dance.

1328
01:50:38,798 --> 01:50:40,925
After seeing your dance
they can die peacefully.

1329
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:44,103
So sweet!

1330
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:45,768
Yes...

1331
01:50:45,972 --> 01:50:47,940
Have you noticed?
let their souls rest in peace.

1332
01:50:48,241 --> 01:50:49,765
Why are you still hesitating?

1333
01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:53,279
You can dance infront
of people of Singapore & Malaysia,

1334
01:50:53,480 --> 01:50:55,880
Can't you dance infront of
our country people?

1335
01:50:57,484 --> 01:50:58,883
They say you can dance in Singapore...

1336
01:50:59,653 --> 01:51:02,451
Don't cry...She'll dance...
She'll...

1337
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:03,452
Don't feel...

1338
01:51:04,591 --> 01:51:05,455
Sound...

1339
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:13,895
TAMILINI

1340
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,058
Sing louder.

1341
01:51:16,836 --> 01:51:17,666
Fall at her feet.

1342
01:51:24,010 --> 01:51:24,738
Be careful...Come slowly...

1343
01:51:26,713 --> 01:51:27,805
Move...move.

1344
01:51:29,015 --> 01:51:29,811
Get lost.

1345
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:43,393
TAMILINI

1346
01:51:43,697 --> 01:51:45,824
Goddess Lakshmi has come...
- lt's me only.

1347
01:51:46,032 --> 01:51:48,660
She gave lot of wealth.- Have it.

1348
01:51:48,868 --> 01:51:53,828
Our threshold will become
pleasant.- Excellent.

1349
01:51:54,040 --> 01:51:56,167
Oh beautiful flower.- Wow.

1350
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:58,844
ln the kind way...- Then?

1351
01:51:59,045 --> 01:52:03,914
She filled me with love.
- That's it.

1352
01:52:04,117 --> 01:52:25,962
TAMILINI

1353
01:52:26,072 --> 01:52:27,369
Oh saffron flowers.

1354
01:52:28,074 --> 01:52:29,371
Oh lovely dove.

1355
01:52:34,080 --> 01:52:37,538
Oh maiden! Happiness is overwhelming
by seeing you.

1356
01:52:38,084 --> 01:52:39,711
Don't kick me...
Oh its paining. lt's paining.

1357
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:49,226
You scoundrel, don't apple polish me.

1358
01:52:49,429 --> 01:52:52,956
Don't act too smart with me.

1359
01:52:57,103 --> 01:53:00,402
After talking through
your bewitching eyes,

1360
01:53:00,607 --> 01:53:04,236
Why are you running away?

1361
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:14,580
Why are you not allowing me
to touch your hand?

1362
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:17,848
Why is it so? Dear.

1363
01:53:18,291 --> 01:53:21,419
Oh! Darling....

1364
01:53:21,628 --> 01:53:24,927
Why dear?

1365
01:53:25,131 --> 01:53:31,331
Oh Fiance...Fian...

1366
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:34,106
What? Sakthi.
- Wait...Wait...Have this.

1367
01:53:34,307 --> 01:53:35,604
Hey, go and have a look.

1368
01:53:42,649 --> 01:53:47,279
Did your kingdom of
dreams become beautiful?

1369
01:53:47,487 --> 01:53:52,015
lt has been built & there's victory.

1370
01:53:52,325 --> 01:53:56,455
Did your kingdom of dreams
become beautiful?

1371
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:58,961
lt has been built &
there's victory.

1372
01:53:59,165 --> 01:54:04,296
There's no law & order and the
wheel of joy is rotated,

1373
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:09,639
There, l'm the king.

1374
01:54:17,517 --> 01:54:18,506
lt's enough, come on...Man...

1375
01:54:21,454 --> 01:54:23,354
Our souls attain salvation
on seeing your smile.

1376
01:54:23,523 --> 01:54:25,718
You're the strength of my soul,
Oh! Lord Saravana.

1377
01:54:26,025 --> 01:54:28,493
Chanting your name

1378
01:54:28,862 --> 01:54:29,658
Oh Lord Muruga.

Are you feeling shy to see my dance?

1385
01:55:50,109 --> 01:56:00,747

Hey smuggler! Play the song.

Why is this song so lengthy?
- lt's an old song, madam.

1395

Nice crowd.

01:58:20,593 --> 01:58:21,059
Hello...Wait...Wait...

1408
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:22,727
Madam, it seems someone has
kidnapped you...Who's it?

1409
01:58:22,929 --> 01:58:24,556
No one has kidnapped me.

1410
01:58:24,931 --> 01:58:26,398
He's my friend, Sakthi.

1411
01:58:26,599 --> 01:58:28,396
l came here out of my own interest.

1412
01:58:29,268 --> 01:58:30,235
Babu, come here.- Yes, madam.

1413

Explain to him.

1414
01:58:31,270 --> 01:58:33,067
Yes sir, it's nothing like that.
- We received a complaint.

1415
01:58:33,272 --> 01:58:34,068
She came here voluntarily.

1416
01:58:34,273 --> 01:58:35,399
Don't get scared.Tell me,
who's it?- No, it's nothing like that.

1417

No problem...let's go.

Bye...Thanks.

1420
01:58:49,288 --> 01:58:50,482
You should send your
wedding card, right?

1421
01:58:50,957 --> 01:58:52,356
Hey, lift him up.

1422
01:58:53,459 --> 01:58:55,484
Okay, it's enough.
- Hey, give him a big hand...

1423
01:58:55,962 --> 01:58:58,089
Are you all satisfied?
Okay...okay...Karuppan.

1424
01:58:58,297 --> 01:59:01,095
Priest, it's enough.
l'm feeling giddy. Put me down.

1425
01:59:02,201 --> 01:59:03,828
T.Madhivadanan l.A.S.
District Collector, Theni dist.

1426
01:59:08,641 --> 01:59:09,938
Forest was his world,

1427
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:15,103
and he was informing about the
smugglers & bootleggers to the police,

1428
01:59:15,648 --> 01:59:20,108
lt has been more that one month,
there's no information about him.

1429
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:25,951
Once in 10 days, he'll definitely
come & see his children.

1430
01:59:27,994 --> 01:59:29,291
Did you lodge a complaint
in the station?

1431
01:59:29,495 --> 01:59:30,962
l had informed them several times.

1432
01:59:31,497 --> 01:59:34,955
As they are very busy giving
security to some actress,

1433
01:59:35,168 --> 01:59:37,796
they are not giving importance
to my complaint.

1434
01:59:58,691 --> 02:00:00,989
Oh Goddess Sakthi!

1435
02:00:04,030 --> 02:00:05,827
Where's your friend?
Hasn't he come?

1436
02:00:06,032 --> 02:00:07,158
They are over there. Why?

1437
02:00:07,366 --> 02:00:09,561
l didn't ask about them,
that Simran...

1438
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:13,001
She thinks that she
only has a tentalising waist,

1439
02:00:13,206 --> 02:00:14,901
and she was showing-off like this.

1440
02:00:15,374 --> 02:00:18,002
You were also staring
with a gaping mouth.

1441
02:00:18,377 --> 02:00:19,844
She was dancing because
she knows dance.

1442
02:00:20,046 --> 02:00:21,911
lf you know, you too could've
come & danced, right?

1443
02:00:22,715 --> 02:00:26,845
l can't dance like her shamelessly
infront of others!

1444
02:00:27,386 --> 02:00:29,354
You're envious of her dance.

1445
02:00:29,555 --> 02:00:30,681
Me?

1446
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:34,188
ln the inter-college competition.
l was the best performer.

1447
02:00:34,393 --> 02:00:35,860
Do you know how many cups
l have won?

1448
02:00:36,062 --> 02:00:37,689
lf you don't believe,
come & see in my house.

1449
02:00:37,897 --> 02:00:39,524
Yes, she has lot of
medals and certificates.

1450
02:00:39,732 --> 02:00:42,200
Hell with you! Go that side, we are having
personal conversation, aren't we?

1451
02:00:42,401 --> 02:00:43,197
Why are you always with her?

1452
02:00:43,402 --> 02:00:45,370
Hey, don't insult my friend.

1453
02:00:45,571 --> 02:00:47,869
l too give importance to
my friend like you.

1454
02:00:48,074 --> 02:00:51,043
Manju, l've come here in search of you.
Don't quarrel unnecessarily.

1455
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:52,711
Why did you come in search of me?

1456
02:00:52,912 --> 02:00:57,144
When she put her hands on you,
you smiled at her like this, didn't you?

1457
02:00:57,750 --> 02:01:00,878
You shameless fellow,
Why didn't you go with her?

1458
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:02,216
l would've gone.

1459
02:01:03,089 --> 02:01:04,886
But, l didn't like to go
there leaving you.

1460
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:07,889
Don't act. You didn't like
to go leaving him.

1461
02:01:08,261 --> 02:01:09,285
l swear, Manju.

1462
02:01:09,595 --> 02:01:13,554
You're lying. You're lying.
- Don't beat.

1463
02:01:13,766 --> 02:01:15,529
l've bought 2 cinema tickets.

1464
02:01:15,668 --> 02:01:17,135
Don't lie.- Listen to me.
- Don't beat me.

1465
02:01:17,336 --> 02:01:18,633
l swear on our future child.

1466
02:01:19,505 --> 02:01:19,971
What did you say?

1467
02:01:20,172 --> 02:01:21,901
l said, l swear on our future child.

1468
02:01:23,175 --> 02:01:24,802
Don't beat me.

1469
02:01:26,178 --> 02:01:26,906
Chitthan, it's nothing.

1470
02:01:29,682 --> 02:01:30,910
Chitthan, it's nothing.
Just for fun.

1471
02:01:32,018 --> 02:01:32,985
Didn't l tell you not to beat me?

1472
02:01:33,185 --> 02:01:33,981
Hey, don't pull me.

1473
02:01:36,856 --> 02:01:39,051
Didn't l tell you it's for fun?
Leave me.

1474
02:01:39,258 --> 02:01:40,987
Go...Go...Go, man.

1475
02:01:41,527 --> 02:01:45,827
On depending whom was l born?

1476
02:01:46,198 --> 02:01:51,261
When l win the time,
come to me, man.

1477
02:01:51,704 --> 02:01:53,001
My tickets are wasted.

1478
02:01:53,205 --> 02:01:55,173
Take these & go with
your mad friends.

1479
02:02:33,779 --> 02:02:35,246
He has come.

1480
02:02:35,614 --> 02:02:36,239
Greetings, sir.

1481
02:02:38,617 --> 02:02:39,914
Where is he?- Who?

1482
02:02:40,619 --> 02:02:41,347
Chitthan.

1483
02:02:41,620 --> 02:02:44,088
Has he started to kill &
burn human bodies?

1484
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:46,918
Sir, you're talking as though
you were with him.

1485
02:02:47,126 --> 02:02:50,425
Hey, l'll tear your mouth. Will you
send him or l've to drag him away?

1486
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:54,258
What? lf you touch him,
he'll put you in soup.

1487
02:02:54,467 --> 02:02:55,934
Why are you showing off unnecessarily?

1488
02:02:56,469 --> 02:02:57,834
Here he is...Drag him.

1489
02:02:58,637 --> 02:03:02,266
Look, this is an order from collector.
He has asked me to interrogate him.

1490
02:03:02,475 --> 02:03:04,773
Don't make it a big issue,
send him with me.

1491
02:03:04,977 --> 02:03:07,377
Say like this. lnstead,
you're talking so rudely?

1492
02:03:07,980 --> 02:03:09,777
Okay l'll send him.
l want to see the collector.

1493
02:03:09,982 --> 02:03:13,281
ls collector your classmate?
lt's a serious matter.

1494
02:03:13,652 --> 02:03:15,176
Ask him to come. Come here.

1495
02:03:16,155 --> 02:03:18,385
Ask him not to behave inhumanly
during investigation.

1496
02:03:19,658 --> 02:03:22,126
Nothing short of this. He said
he wants to see the collector, right?

1497
02:03:22,328 --> 02:03:23,625
Make arrangements, he'll say.

1498
02:03:23,829 --> 02:03:25,797

1499
02:03:25,998 --> 02:03:28,193
l'll make arrangements.
- Come on.

1500
02:03:29,335 --> 02:03:30,131
Chitthan, come here.

1501
02:03:30,836 --> 02:03:33,304
He's our friend. Don't harm him.

1502
02:03:34,340 --> 02:03:35,068
Go and sit.

1503
02:03:35,841 --> 02:03:37,468
Did he understand?
Tell him clearly.

1504
02:03:37,676 --> 02:03:39,473
Didn't he shake his head violently?
Why are you asking like this?

1505
02:03:39,678 --> 02:03:41,407
lt's very clear to him.
You carry on.

1506
02:03:53,859 --> 02:03:56,157
l'm Madhivadanan.
- l'm Sakthivel.

1507
02:03:56,529 --> 02:03:57,154

1508
02:03:57,696 --> 02:04:00,824
So nice of you. Will you shake
hands even with me?

1509
02:04:01,033 --> 02:04:02,159
But, policemen aren't like that,

1510
02:04:02,368 --> 02:04:03,494
nursing the old enemity,

1511
02:04:03,702 --> 02:04:06,170
now since they've got the opportunity,
they are trying to dig out the old cases.

1512
02:04:06,372 --> 02:04:09,569
Look police are our friendly neighbours.
Don't talk like that.

1513
02:04:10,876 --> 02:04:14,243
Okay, l'll explain everything
clearly to you.

1514
02:04:31,063 --> 02:04:33,463
His profession is to
burn corpses.

1515
02:04:33,899 --> 02:04:37,357
lf his boss orders him to do a job,
can he refuse him?

1516
02:04:42,408 --> 02:04:45,707
They've family & children,
so they won't be truthful.

1517
02:04:46,745 --> 02:04:50,545
But, we aren't like them.
We are orphans.

1518
02:04:51,250 --> 02:04:53,616
lf someone gives us food &
pay us Rs.5 or Rs.10,

1519
02:04:54,086 --> 02:04:56,714
without deciphering his words,
we'll obey him.

1520
02:04:57,423 --> 02:04:59,220
Sir, l'll cry only when l'm drunk.

1521
02:04:59,758 --> 02:05:00,725
Today, l'm not drunk.

1522
02:05:05,097 --> 02:05:06,223
Calm down....Calm down.

1523
02:05:14,773 --> 02:05:16,400
Hey Cheat, come here.

1524
02:05:16,509 --> 02:05:18,136
Wait, Tiger Dayanidhi is calling.

1525
02:05:19,945 --> 02:05:20,411
What's it? Sir.

1526
02:05:20,613 --> 02:05:22,638
Mahadevan asked you to meet him.
Get into the car.

1527
02:05:23,782 --> 02:05:24,578
Why should l come?

1528
02:05:24,783 --> 02:05:26,410
Wait, l'll tell...

1529
02:05:26,785 --> 02:05:28,412
Thinking that you've
Collector's support,

1530
02:05:28,621 --> 02:05:32,250
don't ever dare to give
statement against the boss?

1531
02:05:32,458 --> 02:05:32,924
They all...

1532
02:05:33,125 --> 02:05:35,753
Today they'll be with you. Tomorrow,
if they leave you, where will you go?

1533
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:36,856
That's what you wanted to say, right?

1534
02:05:37,463 --> 02:05:38,930
l know everything.
Mind your job.

1535
02:05:39,131 --> 02:05:42,931
Cheat, he has given you money.
Go & settle in Maharashtra.

1536
02:05:43,135 --> 02:05:45,763
Now 'cakes' are in great demand there.
Do that job & lead your life.

1537
02:05:46,138 --> 02:05:47,935
Why should we prepare cakes?

1538
02:05:48,140 --> 02:05:49,937
Am l not an educated person?
Give me respect.

1539
02:05:50,142 --> 02:05:52,610
Then be a lawyer not a broker.

1540
02:05:52,811 --> 02:05:54,938
Cheat, 'Make hay while the sun shines''.

1541
02:05:55,147 --> 02:05:56,614
l'll give as much as you want.

1542
02:05:57,650 --> 02:06:00,778
He is in distress. lf you want, l'll
make you his proxy. What do you say?

1543
02:06:01,153 --> 02:06:01,949
You...

1544
02:06:11,830 --> 02:06:12,626
Greetings sir.

1545
02:06:12,831 --> 02:06:13,456
Did he take it?

1546
02:06:13,832 --> 02:06:16,130
No. l got nicely from him.

1547
02:06:17,169 --> 02:06:17,635
Have it.

1548
02:06:19,338 --> 02:06:20,635
Finally, what did he say?

1549
02:06:21,006 --> 02:06:24,908
He's not leaving Chitthan alone.

1550
02:06:26,512 --> 02:06:28,980
l even provoked him to
be your proxy.

1551
02:06:29,515 --> 02:06:30,641
But that stupid fellow asked me
such a question,

1552
02:06:30,849 --> 02:06:33,909
that l can never face my
mother in my life.

1553
02:06:35,521 --> 02:06:38,319
Forget it. He made our men to become
their witnesses.

1554
02:06:38,857 --> 02:06:40,916
lf you want to stay alive
with your family,

1555
02:06:41,193 --> 02:06:44,924
instead of begging our men,
surrender yourself to your opponent.

1556
02:06:45,197 --> 02:06:45,993
Oh God.

1557
02:06:46,865 --> 02:06:48,594
How dare you ask him
to fall at his feet?

1558
02:06:51,537 --> 02:06:53,596
l'll slipper you...Be careful.

1559
02:06:53,872 --> 02:06:57,672
Atleast he abused me decently,
But you're abusing me very indecently.

1560
02:06:57,876 --> 02:06:59,070
look at my fate.

1561
02:07:00,212 --> 02:07:02,077
l never got a kick
even from my master.

1562
02:07:02,715 --> 02:07:04,012
lnstead of being a lawyer,

1563
02:07:04,216 --> 02:07:06,013
l can go to Maharasthra &
prepare cakes.

1564
02:07:06,885 --> 02:07:09,012
Sir, shall l talk to
Chitthan personally?

1565
02:07:09,221 --> 02:07:12,019
Hey, keep quiet.
Now is he a problem?

1566
02:07:13,158 --> 02:07:14,216
Where is that man now?

1567
02:07:15,027 --> 02:07:17,325
He is going to ogle at girls.

1568
02:07:17,696 --> 02:07:20,256
He is going in search of his sweet heart.

1569
02:07:20,766 --> 02:07:24,361
Chitthan, clap.
Yes, like that.

1570
02:07:27,573 --> 02:07:30,337
Adding golden shine to her
ordinary looks, she's charming him.

1571
02:07:30,542 --> 02:07:33,534
Your eyes are filling up the
void in my life.

1572
02:07:36,715 --> 02:07:37,511
Hey, listen to it.

1573
02:07:41,687 --> 02:07:44,315
lf l commit sins further harming
good people like you...

1574
02:07:45,691 --> 02:07:47,886
God will punish me with
a gory death.

1575
02:07:50,195 --> 02:07:53,289
l believe in God.
l don't know about you.

1576
02:07:53,832 --> 02:07:55,732
You don't cry. Atleast
allow me to cry.

1577
02:07:55,934 --> 02:07:57,561
l too believe.
- ls it? Which God?

1578
02:08:00,539 --> 02:08:01,233
Me?

1579
02:08:04,043 --> 02:08:09,640
A man who comes to kill another man,
changes his heart and asks forgiveness.

1580
02:08:11,383 --> 02:08:12,941
According to me, he's a God.

1581
02:08:13,152 --> 02:08:15,643
l've changed my heart.
l'm not any God.

1582
02:08:16,055 --> 02:08:20,355
Don't talk like an atheist.
There are many Gods roaming around.

1583
02:08:20,559 --> 02:08:22,220
We are not able to identify them.
Believe in God.

1584
02:08:24,096 --> 02:08:25,654
Thanks & bye.

1585
02:08:25,864 --> 02:08:31,996
A man drinking nectar of Love,
lives eternally.

1586
02:08:32,104 --> 02:08:38,270
Life's span is as long as
your heart's magnanimity.

1587
02:08:38,477 --> 02:08:47,715
Love is God.

1588
02:08:58,664 --> 02:09:00,564
Hey, go and bring the cycle.- Okay.

1589
02:09:14,780 --> 02:09:16,338
You go...l'll drop her & come.

1590
02:09:17,583 --> 02:09:19,744
Hey, get down...
Let them go.

1591
02:09:19,952 --> 02:09:22,147
Chitthan, just 5 minutes...
l'll drop her and come.

1592
02:09:23,255 --> 02:09:25,314
When l tell you, you should obey me.
l'll come immediately.

1593
02:09:26,825 --> 02:09:29,521
Sister, take him carefully. See you.
- Come.

1594
02:09:29,762 --> 02:09:30,660
Come...Come...

1595
02:09:33,265 --> 02:09:35,392
Hey, he'll come...Come on.

1596
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:43,101
Adding golden shine to her
ordinary looks, she's charming him.

1597
02:09:43,308 --> 02:09:46,505
Your eyes are filling up the
void in my life.

1598
02:09:53,018 --> 02:09:55,646
Town bus is empty.

1599
02:09:55,854 --> 02:09:58,220
Let us go to a theatre.....

1600
02:10:00,025 --> 02:10:01,583
You scoundrel, are you blind?

1601
02:10:01,794 --> 02:10:03,022
You fool! ls this the way to drive?

1602
02:10:03,228 --> 02:10:03,922
Manju, are you alright?

1603
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:06,925
Hey, who are you?

1604
02:10:12,037 --> 02:10:12,628
Sakthi....

1605
02:10:17,676 --> 02:10:19,871
Hey, leave him.

1606
02:10:44,102 --> 02:10:46,662
Sakthi behind you...

1607
02:10:49,508 --> 02:10:51,567
Sakthi, come here. Let's go.
Let's go, Sakthi.

1608
02:10:51,777 --> 02:10:54,075
Manju, you go....Go....

1609
02:10:55,914 --> 02:10:58,610
Sakthi....- Manju, you go.

1610
02:10:58,817 --> 02:11:01,183
l won't.- Go, Manju.

1611
02:11:02,855 --> 02:11:06,916
Listen to me.
Go, Manju...Go...

1612
02:12:01,113 --> 02:12:02,045
What's your age, man?

1613
02:12:03,849 --> 02:12:05,214
Why are you troubling me?

1614
02:12:08,153 --> 02:12:09,745
Are you making our men as your
witnesses?

1615
02:12:11,223 --> 02:12:14,056
You orphan, do you want me
to go to jail at this age?

1616
02:12:20,933 --> 02:12:25,836
Hey, what happened?
Why are you crying?

1617
02:12:26,038 --> 02:12:27,403
Who's it?- What happened, Manju?

1618
02:12:27,606 --> 02:12:28,766
Tell me, Manju.

1619
02:12:28,974 --> 02:12:31,408
Where's he? Where's Sakthi?

1620
02:12:36,315 --> 02:12:39,148
What happened to her?

1621
02:12:39,551 --> 02:12:41,143
Open your mouth & say...

1622
02:12:41,887 --> 02:12:44,355
What happened to you?
Where's he?

1623
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:47,824
Open your mouth and say....something.

1624
02:12:48,327 --> 02:12:51,125
What's it?- What happened?

1625
02:12:51,463 --> 02:12:53,158
What happened?- Say something.

1626
02:12:53,365 --> 02:12:55,595
Go and bring some water...Go...
- Make it fast.

1627
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:56,859
What happened?

1628
02:12:59,838 --> 02:13:02,773
Have some water.- No need to worry.

1629
02:13:03,775 --> 02:13:06,209
Go and see what happened
to him. Go...

1630
02:13:06,478 --> 02:13:07,740
What happened?

1631
02:13:19,391 --> 02:13:21,791
Manju, tell me...Oh God.

1632
02:13:22,327 --> 02:13:24,124
Tell me, where's Sakthi?

1633
02:13:39,111 --> 02:13:41,807
Manju...Manju...

1634
02:13:46,952 --> 02:13:48,283
Chitthan, did you see Sakthi?

1635
02:13:50,856 --> 02:13:52,585
l'm asking you only,
did you see him?

1636
02:13:53,558 --> 02:13:55,389
lf he had seen him,
he would've brought him here.

1637
02:13:55,594 --> 02:13:57,619
He won't go anywhere
without telling us.

1638
02:13:57,863 --> 02:13:59,558
And she has fainted.

1639
02:13:59,965 --> 02:14:01,796
l'm worried.

1640
02:14:22,054 --> 02:14:22,986
Hey you Karuppan.

1641
02:15:59,518 --> 02:16:03,352
Oh God, what have they done?

1642
02:16:57,676 --> 02:17:00,110
Father, Sakthi...

1643
02:17:02,480 --> 02:17:03,242
Don't cry.

1644
02:17:50,328 --> 02:17:52,626
When did you get the information?
- ln the morning.

1645
02:17:53,832 --> 02:17:56,300
Who saw the body first?
- l don't know.

1646
02:17:57,469 --> 02:17:58,527
Say without crying.

1647
02:18:01,072 --> 02:18:02,596
Who else was close to him?

1648
02:18:04,943 --> 02:18:07,503
Say without crying...Say...

1649
02:19:06,871 --> 02:19:11,137
Look sister, that scoundrel is
not coming near him.

1650
02:19:12,744 --> 02:19:16,908
Why did we allow this dog
inside the house?

1651
02:19:17,248 --> 02:19:19,182
He is dead.

1652
02:19:19,384 --> 02:19:23,115
He's not even shedding a drop of tear
& sitting like a stone.

1653
02:19:27,792 --> 02:19:29,054
Oh God!

1654
02:19:29,994 --> 02:19:33,054
Don't cry. Your Sakthi
has become God.

1655
02:19:51,483 --> 02:19:52,006
Hey...

1656
02:19:52,784 --> 02:19:54,547
Why are you touching him? Why?

1657
02:19:54,753 --> 02:19:58,382
Go....go...- Beat him & sent him away.

1658
02:19:58,590 --> 02:19:59,784
You ungrateful wretch! Get lost.

1659
02:19:59,991 --> 02:20:10,834
Leave this place.
Why did you come here? Go.

1660
02:20:11,035 --> 02:20:15,062
Sakthi took lot of pains for you.
Beat him nicely.

1661
02:20:17,442 --> 02:20:18,466
Why are you touching him?

1662
02:20:18,676 --> 02:20:20,906
Have you come to burn his body?

1663
02:20:21,112 --> 02:20:23,979
Go away.....Go.

1664
02:20:35,059 --> 02:20:36,026
Get lost.

1665
02:20:38,263 --> 02:20:39,059
Get lost.

1666
02:21:50,935 --> 02:21:53,199
Whoever wants to see the face, see it.
l'm going to close it.

1667
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:30,773
My mother left me & died.

1668
02:22:32,410 --> 02:22:36,779
My Guardian left me & died.

1669
02:22:39,884 --> 02:22:43,843
But you....

1670
02:22:45,790 --> 02:22:55,756
But why did you die & make me
shed tears?

1671
02:24:14,545 --> 02:24:29,085
TAMILINI

1672
02:24:29,293 --> 02:24:32,694
Oh! World is in Demon's hand.

1673
02:24:32,897 --> 02:24:36,424
Who has given him right to ruin?

1674
02:24:36,634 --> 02:24:40,092
Come on....Come & show your ploys.

1675
02:24:40,304 --> 02:24:43,740
Come & destroy those evils.

1676
02:24:43,941 --> 02:24:47,433
Violence that has tormented
human beings.

1677
02:24:47,645 --> 02:24:49,237
Hereafter l'll not allow it
to bare it's fangs.

1678
02:24:49,447 --> 02:24:51,176
l'll put an end to it.

1679
02:24:51,382 --> 02:24:58,948
Oh human! l was born in a graveyard.

1680
02:24:59,424 --> 02:25:16,934
TAMILINI

1681
02:25:17,175 --> 02:25:18,642
Hey, what are you looking at?

1682
02:25:18,910 --> 02:25:33,917
TAMILINI

1683
02:25:34,292 --> 02:25:35,589
Hey, why are you taking it?

1684
02:25:35,793 --> 02:25:37,158
Hey, what are you doing?

1685
02:25:39,931 --> 02:25:41,899
When poverty is chasing our lives,

1686
02:25:42,100 --> 02:25:45,695
why should arrogant persons
chase us?

1687
02:25:46,104 --> 02:25:48,038
When our sins are chasing us,

1688
02:25:48,239 --> 02:25:51,936
why should our enemies chase us?

1689
02:25:52,143 --> 02:26:01,518
Oh Goddess Sundari...
Oh Goddess Bhairavi...Oh Goddess...

1690
02:26:02,053 --> 02:26:08,686
Both eyes are smarting by
the glow of fire.

1691
02:26:09,460 --> 02:26:16,127
The entire body is boiled
to take revenge.

1692
02:26:16,768 --> 02:26:21,398
Oh Earth & the sky! Bless him...
Destroy all evil.

1693
02:26:21,606 --> 02:26:25,872
Future should have
noble human beings!

1694
02:27:03,815 --> 02:27:05,442
Within an hour, he should die.

1695
02:27:05,650 --> 02:27:07,208
Otherwise, we'll die.

1696
02:27:07,485 --> 02:27:08,144
Take the vehicle.

1697
02:27:35,313 --> 02:27:39,579
Sakthi....Sakthi.....

1698
02:27:45,022 --> 02:27:46,284
Give back Sakthi...

1699
02:28:10,715 --> 02:28:11,682
Hubby...

1700
02:28:11,983 --> 02:28:15,714
What are you doing? Leave him....

1701
02:28:18,289 --> 02:28:19,313
Oh God!
