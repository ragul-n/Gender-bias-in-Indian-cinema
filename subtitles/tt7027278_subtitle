2
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,160
'Hail Lord Shiva!'

3
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,040
Praise the Lord!
- Praise the Lord!

4
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,000
'Hail Lord Shiva!'

5
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,880
'Keep moving ahead.'

6
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,280
'Take care of your belongings.'

7
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,080
Go to him.

8
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,880
To whom?

9
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,120
Mansoor!

10
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,240
Hail Lord Shiva!

11
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,920
Can't a Hindu take me?

12
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,320
I won't go with him!

13
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,000
Ma, why are you so upset?

14
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,616
We are on a tight budget. We
got a coupon after&nbsp;such difficulty.

15
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,480
Come on...

16
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,400
Your words are like&nbsp;hot
air from a donkey!

17
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,176
Of all the people in this&nbsp;zoo,
you found him?

18
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,320
I won't sit on that mule.

19
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,640
Listen to me...

20
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,920
Mules neither pray in
temples nor read the Quran.

21
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,360
Am I right?

22
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,400
Get up!

23
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,240
He's saying he won't
charge extra for our things.

24
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,160
Come on, get up. Let's go.

25
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,560
Is he frisky?

26
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,616
He won't jump off
the&nbsp;mountain with me, will he?

27
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,160
No, Ma! He's done it
just&nbsp;once or twice before.

28
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,136
No... - Okay. Ma, you don't
have&nbsp;to sit on Rustom.

29
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,840
I will carry you myself. Alright?

30
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,880
Is that okay?
- No problem in doing that.

31
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,480
Let me help you sit on it.
- Come, sit.

32
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,440
Why couldn't you just get a Hindu?

33
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,920
Why long for something&nbsp;you
don't have

34
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,640
when you can enjoy&nbsp;that
which you do?

35
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:03,520
Hey! This moron speaks Bhojpuri!

36
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,440
Ma, I speak it all.&nbsp;Gujarati,
Punjabi, Bengali...

37
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,480
I have taken all of&nbsp;lndia
to this temple. Come on.

38
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,200
Hail Shiv, the Auspicious One!

39
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,040
Shiv, the Auspicious One!
Come on, son!

40
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,000
Come on.
- Take care of your belongings.

41
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
This ass won't run&nbsp;away
with our luggage?

42
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,480
No, Ma... Rustom and your
luggage&nbsp;will find their way.

43
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,000
"Hail the Greatest God!"

44
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,920
"My beloved Supreme Lord!"

45
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,560
"How does one breathe
without chanting your name?"

46
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Mansoor.
- Pull harder! Delhi is not too far...

47
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,560
"My karma is bestowed to you."

48
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,520
"You decide my good and my evil."

49
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,400
"I blindly tread the
path you have chosen for me."

50
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:12,720
"Your light ignites my universe
and swallows my darkness."

51
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,480
"Hail the Greatest God!"

52
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,520
"My beloved Kind Hearted Lord!"

53
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,240
"Hail the Creator,
Hail the Originator!"

54
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,280
"Hail the Greatest God!"

55
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,840
"My beloved Kind Hearted Lord,
the Abode of Joy!"

56
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,240
The Pandavas had done penance
after the Mahabharath war.

57
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,000
Shiva was in the form of a bull
when Bheem caught him.

58
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,040
His head appeared in Nepal
and his hump remained here.

59
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,080
Salute officer!
- Greetings!

60
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,920
Almost there Ma.&nbsp;7 kms done.
7 kms to go.

61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,600
What are you made of?
Don't you get tired?

62
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,200
I've eaten Shiva's herb.

63
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,560
Moron! Better not throw&nbsp;me
into the valley...

64
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,520
"But mankind's faith
in you shall live on."

65
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,360
Didn't I tell you Ma...

66
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,440
Rustom will find his way.

67
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,280
Come boy.

68
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,040
"You are the originator of all."

69
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,640
Now where are you going?

70
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,320
Ma, this is my area.
We can have some&nbsp;refreshments here.

71
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,760
We'll stop here for a little while.

72
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,320
Come on, Rustom.

73
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,160
Stop...

74
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,280
Ma, easy...

75
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,400
One minute...

76
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,240
Please hold this...

77
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,120
Wait here...

78
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,440
Here you go.

79
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,240
I know the shop owner...

80
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,360
She is big-hearted,
won't take any money.

81
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,600
No one is big-hearted for free.

82
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,000
You could ask for anything
in exchange for this!

83
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,216
Hold this, hold this. - 'It is wrong,
you didn't send us the sweets.'

84
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,680
Quickly.

85
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,040
Let's go...

86
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,080
Can you pass that?

87
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,216
Hail Shiv, the Auspicious One!

88
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,720
Hail the Innocent One!

89
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,480
Ma... I'll see you in the evening.

90
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,600
Be so kind as to
bring&nbsp;some money home.

91
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,360
Don't splurge it
all on the pilgrims.

92
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:33,120
"Like a pearl in a shell,"

93
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,320
"You reside within me,
my beloved Lord!"

94
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,840
"I lived with the illusion."

95
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,760
"Of Me, Myself and I."

96
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,280
"You are the creator,
You are the destroyer."

97
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,160
"It is all you."
- Ma... we've reached.

98
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,960
Here you go...

99
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:03,120
"Bless me as I bow
my head in front of you."

100
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,840
"Hail the Greatest God!"

101
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,480
"My beloved Kind Hearted Lord,
the Abode of Joy."

102
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,400
"Hail the Greatest God!"

103
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:19,080
"My beloved Kind Hearted Lord,
the Abode of Joy."

104
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,080
"Hail the Greatest God!"

105
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,720
"My beloved Kind Hearted Lord,
the Abode of Joy."

106
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
"Hail the Greatest God!"

107
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,520
"My beloved Kind Hearted Lord,
the Abode of Joy."

108
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,280
"My beloved Kind Hearted Lord,
the Abode of Joy."

109
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,200
"My beloved Kind Hearted Lord,
the Abode of Joy."

110
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,120
Ma, Paid your respects?

111
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,400
Yes, yes. God bless you!

112
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
Selfie?

113
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,560
Selfie?

114
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,920
Amazing!

115
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,400
Please come.

116
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,720
Come on. Smile.

117
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,320
Say something!

118
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,600
Forgive me, I didn't see you.

119
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,560
Didn't see me?

120
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,296
It's not a moonless night
that you couldn't see.

121
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,920
It's broad daylight...

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,816
He came straight and&nbsp;took
a dump in my path!

123
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,976
And you say you didn't see me?

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Let it go. He's a mule.

125
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,240
He's a mule, but what about you?

126
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,960
The mule will not come and say...

127
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,960
"Brother, take me to the bathroom!"

128
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,480
My brand new slippers...

129
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,240
Your mule has left
his blessings on it!

130
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,000
Now what will I do with it?

131
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,040
Hail the Untainted One!

132
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,640
Oh Wise One...
haven't seen you in 2 days?

133
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,440
But I could see you.

134
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's drink the poison
of the valley...

135
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,040
Let's indulge some fools...

136
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,280
Let's play Shiva!

137
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,680
Bala... Tourist season has started,

138
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,600
but your leaking
roof hasn't stopped.

139
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,600
His roof has been&nbsp;leaking
since 5 years...

140
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:57,760
Forget that...

141
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,320
when I see what's happening&nbsp;up
there it breaks my heart...

142
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,000
there are no facilities for porters,
but every amenity for the pilgrims.

143
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,440
I've spoken to them...

144
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,920
the commission has promised
to find a solution.

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,560
New rates for porters&nbsp;were
also discussed.

146
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,176
Before we get into that, &nbsp;something
important has come up...

147
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,000
We need to think about it...

148
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,520
The commission wants to
open&nbsp;a 2 star hotel in Rambara...

149
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
and slowly after that
a&nbsp;guest house, lodge...

150
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,240
Hail the Untainted One!

151
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,560
Praise the Lord!

152
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,760
Started the meeting without us?

153
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,840
Thank you.

154
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,800
How can they do that?

155
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,520
It is prohibited to
build&nbsp;a hotel in this area.

156
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,960
Without a permit you&nbsp;can't
build anything here...

157
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,080
There is a rate card for a permit.
Pay the price and it's yours!

158
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
The High Priest's nephew, Kullu,
is leading this plan for the hotel.

159
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,200
We should think about it and
present our case to them quickly.

160
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,816
May you rot in hell
you piece of shit!

161
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,000
May your throat be
parched like a dry leaf!

162
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,280
Uncle... You've sat
on the mattress again?

163
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,600
I told you when you sit there, &nbsp;this
monster hits the ball even harder.

164
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,840
Can't you sit outside
for&nbsp;2 minutes... For India?

165
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,120
If a customer visits can I come in?
- Uncle!

166
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,280
Whether Pakistan hits or not,

167
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,616
you'll definitely get
a few&nbsp;from your father today...

168
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,560
Hung me by the door...

169
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,560
As if we will make India
win by me suffering in the cold!

170
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,840
'India is playing
a commendable match.'

171
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,240
'There are a few balls left.
India may win this match.'

172
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,960
'Anything is possible.'

173
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,440
'Here goes the ball in the air.
I think it is...'

174
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,640
Holy shit!
He's got the Devil in him!

175
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,400
Hail the Lord!
- He's killing it.

176
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,176
The Ganges won't be enough&nbsp;to
wash that mouth, Ma

177
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,040
try using soap or detergent!

178
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,720
'He is displaying
an excellent batting.'

179
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,280
You mother...

180
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,400
What did you say?

181
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,720
Blessings!

182
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
Your mother's blessings.

183
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,040
Mannerless!

184
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,720
Good evening Brijraj Ji.

185
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,320
Same to you.

186
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,840
Brother, why are you standing here?
You'll catch a cold.

187
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,720
Come inside. Please.

188
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,720
'Who will open the match today?'

189
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,960
Hail Shiv, the Innocent!

190
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,120
'If the day starts well, then...'

191
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
Mandakini, close this box.

192
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,040
'India may find it difficult
to make 20 runs in this situation.'

193
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,080
'What do you think?
- Yes, it may...'

194
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,200
Yes, brother...

195
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,200
Oh great God...

196
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,440
The tourist season has started

197
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,120
from tomorrow it
will be busy up there.

198
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,520
This time brother will
handle&nbsp;the accounts down here

199
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,120
and you 2 girls
will be up at Shankar lodge.

200
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,920
Lata, I can't seem to find
my set of keys for the storeroom.

201
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,600
The keys are ready.
I'll go get them.

202
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,456
And Dad this time please&nbsp;let
me do the accounts...

203
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,440
I'm fed up of cooking, cleaning&nbsp;and
doing women's chores at the lodge!

204
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,640
Put her in a rocket
and&nbsp;send her to the moon!

205
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,440
Understanding her
is beyond mankind.

206
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,880
She's opened a Facebook&nbsp;account
on the internet...

207
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,400
She's growing wings now...

208
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,720
She is constantly putting&nbsp;up
pictures of herself...

209
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,080
Keep her in check&nbsp;or
she will fly away.

210
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
Move, move aside!

211
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,160
'The pressure is increasing.'

212
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,280
'And here goes another one.'

213
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,200
'India is facing strong pressure.'

214
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,360
Get up, you eclair...

215
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,960
Last time I single-handedly
made India win

216
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,080
sitting right here.
I didn't even use the bathroom.

217
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,960
You know how
much&nbsp;pressure I was under?

218
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:39,240
'He striked the ball in the air.
But...'

219
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:42,640
Ajmal! May you
be damned!&nbsp;Barbarian!

220
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
Out? Who took the catch?

221
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,640
See for yourself.

222
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,800
I can't!
Just tell me who took the catch?

223
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,720
Azhar.

224
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,360
'The loss of this wicket
can be troublesome for India.'

225
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,520
9 balls and 17 runs to go...

226
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,016
Junaid is bowling now so
the last over will be bowled by...

227
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,400
Saeed Ajmal.

228
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,920
'A few balls to go.
India has a chance to win.'

229
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,120
'The ball is in the air once again.
Is another wicket down?'

230
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,160
'This time, he dropped the catch!'

231
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,640
Not out!! not out!

232
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
Not out!

233
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,200
'Not out. It's amazing!'

234
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,200
Even though that was a slow bowler
our batsman is even slower!

235
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,680
They are just fiddling&nbsp;around
at the crease.

236
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,201
Is this your style or have you
taken&nbsp;a vow not to watch the game?

237
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,520
'The batsman
will only get a single.'

238
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,520
What happened?

239
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,880
Nothing... that was headed for
a boundary&nbsp;but the rascals stopped it!

240
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Wonder which power goat&nbsp;they
ate for breakfast today!

241
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,400
Please Shiva make us win today...

242
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,920
If you make us win today
I won't lie for a month.

243
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,680
1 run... Come back you idiot...

244
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,840
Bloody!

245
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,880
No problem... 2 balls left.

246
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,520
I'll steal Rs.100 from
the&nbsp;Priest and donate it...

247
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,280
4 runs off this ball, please!

248
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,000
'Only a single run on this ball.'

249
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,720
That's it! I'm done.
I can't watch India lose...

250
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,360
Listen... there can be
a 6 off&nbsp;the last ball also...

251
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
'India needs 6 runs to win.'

252
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,920
Today Shiva is not in the mood...

253
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,280
He will get out.

254
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,160
Why don't you ask your Allah?

255
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,040
All you Gods above, please save us!

256
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,640
'Here goes a sixer!'

257
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,600
Shameless.

258
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,080
Come on... Come home now!

259
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,160
Man of the match... Shall we?

260
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,536
Someone stole the signboard again?

261
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,600
Himalaya huffing like he will die..

262
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,880
If you see anyone tell me!

263
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,136
Never seen you move&nbsp;for
a missing person

264
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,536
how come you're out
looking for a signboard?

265
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,560
Exactly!

266
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,080
Someone stole the signboard
from the Magistrate's office.

267
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,960
And I'm paying the price!

268
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,560
Couldn't they steal
a tailor's signboard?

269
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,200
You're right...

270
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,960
Will you have some tea?
Give Sir some tea.

271
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,280
You'll find him.

272
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,520
Please finish this by today.

273
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Increase the ration of
pulses and rice by 10 bags each.

274
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,456
There should be no shortage.

275
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,320
The pilgrims must be taken care of.

276
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,720
Mukkuji... - The Priest has sent
this for you to sign.

277
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,720
That's it? Wait a minute...

278
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,400
Why? Are peacocks dancing&nbsp;here
that I should stay?

279
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,120
Hail the Innocent One!
- Hail the Innocent One!

280
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,520
Thank you, brother.

281
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,880
That's perfect. This will do.

282
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,960
How many times have I&nbsp;told
you rides stop there

283
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:52,120
or you can even drop
them off at the food stall.

284
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,240
I can drop the
pilgrims 2 kms away...

285
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,240
I come here for myself.
To give thanks.

286
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,600
There are other places&nbsp;your
people have to give thanks.

287
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,080
You don't need a
place to give thanks.

288
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,840
That can be given
from&nbsp;the grave as well.

289
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Isn't it?

290
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Salute, sir.

291
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,160
'Hail Lord Shiva!'
- Straight.

292
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,320
When he brings a pilgrim,
he rings the bell!

293
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,240
He is innocent.

294
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,160
Father-in-law.

295
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,240
Kullu!

296
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,240
I know him. He used to
come here with his father.

297
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,840
Father-in-law, if you don't keep
a bull on a tight leash,

298
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,960
you will have to
deal with the horns.

299
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,560
I promise you it won't be pleasant.

300
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,440
Here, eat some holy sweet...

301
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,960
and let me know
about this evening...

302
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,560
Lata has been asking about you.

303
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,720
I'll be there.

304
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,640
Hail Lord Shiva.
- Hail Lord Shiva.

305
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,480
Hey, Mukku. How are you?

306
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,640
To Rambara.

307
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,520
You know who I am?

308
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,960
Shall we?

309
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,600
Please stop for 2 minutes.

310
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,520
Stop here.

311
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,560
What kind of man are you?

312
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,560
Didn't your mother
teach you chivalry?

313
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,440
My mother taught me not to steal.

314
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,480
Yes, I steal signboards...

315
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,160
Wherever they find a spot,
they put one up!

316
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,040
Instead of seeing
trees, &nbsp;valleys and mountains,

317
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,720
only these ugly signboards&nbsp;are
visible in this valley!

318
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,080
I do so much work alone.

319
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,640
I have taken on the
onus&nbsp;of the whole valley.

320
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,160
Do you know, how much
pressure there is on me?

321
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,960
Come on.

322
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,880
Oh, and if you report it,

323
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,000
I'll just say that you're the thief
and you&nbsp;forcibly brought me here.

324
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,400
There will be trouble.

325
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,080
I am certain you are going
to put me in big trouble.

326
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,320
See you.

327
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,080
Hail Lord Krishna.

328
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,520
Hail the Innocent One.

329
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,640
Kullu. Come son!

330
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,040
I've sent the Chief
an&nbsp;invitation on your behalf...

331
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,176
This time when the&nbsp;Home
Minister visits,

332
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,936
he will definitely
come&nbsp;over for a cup of tea.

333
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,200
Very good.

334
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,680
Mukku, get Kullu a
glass&nbsp;of milk with almonds!

335
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,800
No, no.
- Why don't I just bring the buffalo?

336
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,160
He can drink directly from it...

337
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,680
Is Mandakini Mishraji home?

338
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,840
Her father is...

339
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,240
Brijraaj Mishraji?

340
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Yes, that's me.

341
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,480
Greetings.
- Greetings!

342
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,520
Myself Dev Prasad Notyal...
- Yes?

343
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,120
Another one will be beaten today.

344
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,240
Have a long life.

345
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,240
I've come to ask for&nbsp;Mandakini's
hand in marriage.

346
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,200
Is there an invitation
to propose to my fiance?

347
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
This is the 5th one in 5 months!

348
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,520
Kullu.

349
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,880
Is your daughter looking to wed
the&nbsp;Pandavas from the Mahabharat?

350
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
Myself Dev Prasad Natyal.

351
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,440
Kullu!

352
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,160
Didn't you hear she is my fiance?

353
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,920
Then why the introduction?

354
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,040
Do you want your
proposal&nbsp;printed on your face?

355
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
Kullu...

356
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,360
Why do I have to
go&nbsp;through this everyday?

357
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,000
Don't you know?

358
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,960
Don't be smart.

359
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,000
But know this

360
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:06,200
when the marriage was arranged it
didn't mean you must fall in love.

361
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,480
Love happens after marriage
understood Mukkuji?

362
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,920
That's not love
that's a trade off, oh Learned One.

363
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,560
Handle your daughters!

364
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,560
Now what happened?

365
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,880
Nothing.

366
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,400
The Priest got touchy!

367
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,936
I'm sure you must&nbsp;have
said something...

368
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,160
College dropout.
Sitting at home to cast an eclipse.

369
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,600
Right, and you graduated
and&nbsp;reached the moon?

370
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,240
You're right here,
serving the Priest.

371
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,240
Are you high?

372
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,160
Not yet
that's the plan for the evening.

373
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,080
Would you and your&nbsp;husband
like to try it?

374
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,160
Chotu said you didn't take the full
fare from the pilgrims again today?

375
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,520
Just 50 short, Ma.

376
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,080
Mansoorji... When you are poor,
every rupee counts.

377
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,120
There are no gold
coins in your palace!

378
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,880
A real palace is not made
of gold. Dad used to say...

379
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,480
Enough! I don't want
to hear&nbsp;what your father said.

380
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,080
Your father made
all these tall claims

381
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,600
and I am paying for it!

382
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,840
He said this is paradise

383
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,240
and the valley swallowed him.

384
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,960
Ma...

385
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,960
Ma....

386
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,880
He's the one who taught you
to ring the temple bell, right?

387
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,336
How many times have
I asked you not to?

388
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,560
Stick to your job.

389
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,800
That's what I do, Ma.

390
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,480
It's my job to go there daily.

391
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,920
I earn my living,
so I show gratitude.

392
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,040
Dad used to...
- Listen.

393
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,560
Before being your father,
he was my husband.

394
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,520
Putting others before himself,
kindness...

395
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,280
He rests in peace
while I am shattered!

396
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,096
When he fell off
the&nbsp;mountain and died

397
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,000
he was trying to fetch
a child's&nbsp;shoe, when he slipped.

398
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,600
Don't be like him...

399
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:10,000
He went to his
grave in his youth...

400
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,280
I love him but
I hate him much more!

401
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,240
He left us all alone.

402
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,280
He was selfish.
- Then so am I...

403
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,680
If I had been with him
he might have been here with us.

404
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:32,040
Hey... Today's war
is over food or work?

405
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,240
Today it's about his father.

406
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,520
Where are you hiding, brother?

407
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,360
Rest in peace, brother!

408
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,320
Check this out!

409
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,600
Afzar... Give him the to-do list.

410
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,480
It's better if the next
war&nbsp;happens after the wedding...

411
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,960
Mr. Mansoor. Organise
the mattresses and heaters.

412
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,600
By tomorrow evening all the&nbsp;mattresses
and heaters will be there

413
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,400
and so will Rustom and I.

414
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,000
You'll take that mule there?

415
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,480
Why not?
It's Rustom's&nbsp;brother's wedding...

416
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,880
I'll hit you!

417
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,400
Reached?

418
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,040
Come! Did you ride the
mule up or use a porter?

419
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,440
Porter...

420
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,560
Great weather!

421
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,440
The morning prayers are at 6.30 am.

422
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,400
This is the key to your room.

423
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,240
Your room is this way.
Yours is this way.

424
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Mukku.

425
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,920
You bring the fried dumplings
for Kullu.

426
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,280
Mukku, don't make a scene.

427
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Come on.

428
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,000
Oops. How clumsy of me.

429
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,240
I won't be able to serve
those dumplings now, will I?

430
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,120
Fool! What a trouble!

431
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,000
Here we go again...

432
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,640
Drama Queen.

433
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,480
You call this drama?

434
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,080
You were 5 when you
both got engaged.

435
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,560
He's been like a brother to me.

436
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,240
At the last minute I should
marry him instead of you?

437
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,640
And our father's agreed!

438
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,520
Who's the wronged one here?

439
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,080
You enjoy giving out punishments?

440
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,976
Don't take that extra
load on your head!

441
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,640
Whatever happened with Kullu
and me has nothing to do with you.

442
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,160
I don't blame you for it.

443
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,240
Sure?

444
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,600
There is a proposal to
build a 2 star hotel in Rambara.

445
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,720
For now we've agreed
to 4-5 shops from our side

446
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,600
and 5 shops from the porter side.

447
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,680
The hotel will stand in the center.

448
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,040
The survey reports say most
tourists would like to stop there.

449
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,360
Kedar is just a 7
kms climb from there

450
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,000
then next will come a
lodge and some food courts...

451
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,160
We've made a detailed plan

452
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,960
for Progress,
Profit and Pilgrimage.

453
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,520
You're going to sweet
talk us into trouble!

454
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,400
What misfortune has
befallen you Durgeji?

455
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,680
I've said a 1,000 times not to remove
the statue of Dhara Devi from Alaknanda.

456
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,640
The river flows
because of Her blessings.

457
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,960
And now more hotels,
more construction in the valley?

458
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,600
We might have to pay
dearly for this progress.

459
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,480
Such old-fashioned ideas but he uses
a smartphone, that's Durgeji for you!

460
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,880
Can you discuss my
promotion as well...

461
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,960
Be patient father-in-law.

462
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,880
If a hotel comes up in Rambara everyone
will profit there will be progress.

463
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,200
If we work together it
will be beneficial to all.

464
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:05,880
If they aren't here in 5 minutes.
I'm leaving.

465
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,560
Be quiet!

466
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,000
It's a group of 20 pilgrims

467
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,560
if we go back without them, we'll never
hear the end of it for the next 20 years.

468
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,240
You know
in America Dad would be jailed

469
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,520
for making his delicate
daughters do this much work!

470
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,520
That too, this?

471
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,320
Mukkuji. Have you met my friend?

472
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Tarang.

473
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,200
Salutations!

474
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,040
Tarang is my school friend

475
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,760
now he will work with us.

476
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,400
Tarang...

477
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
Your sister-in-law
is a little mischievous!

478
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,720
There's a new proposal&nbsp;for
her everyday...

479
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,880
Changed your new phone again?

480
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,080
It's not a relationship that&nbsp;you're
changing it so quickly.

481
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,360
The phone will feel bad.

482
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,360
I left your sister

483
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,560
that's why the anger?

484
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,840
Or I chose you

485
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,400
that's why the attitude?

486
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,520
Brinda, stop crying!

487
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,160
There is a booking for
a&nbsp;group of 10 this evening.

488
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,120
And brother isn't
feeling too well either.

489
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,760
In this condition how will
he handle the shop all alone?

490
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,880
His wife is in the city...

491
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,840
Send the girls to
help&nbsp;him one by one.

492
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,080
OK.

493
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,240
I'll do that.

494
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,240
I'm not going up and down!
Send Brinda.

495
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,720
Right! Like I have
no other work... Queen!

496
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:07,760
Okay.

497
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,720
I'll go. You stay.

498
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
What?

499
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,200
Have some faith in me as well...

500
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,160
I'm not that useless!

501
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,240
I've taken care of myself for 19
years, I'll take care of the shop too.

502
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,080
She agreed rather quickly!

503
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,400
Don't fall for it...
She's a little devil!

504
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,560
Hail the Innocent One.
- Hail the Innocent One.

505
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,921
If you're done taking a selfie,
will you take a passenger?

506
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,400
To Rambara.

507
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,680
Thing is... I'm looking
for a ride&nbsp;straight to Gaurikund.

508
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,160
So? You're not going to
fly to Gaurikund, are you?

509
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,680
You'll have to go via Rambara.

510
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,520
But, it will make things difficult.
- What?

511
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,720
Finding a ride from Rambara
to&nbsp;Gaurikand will be difficult, so...

512
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,000
I'll pay the fare till Gaurikund.

513
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,320
Drop me off at
Rambara, &nbsp;what's it to you?

514
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,920
Come on!

515
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,440
Name?

516
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,320
Mansoor.

517
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,720
His...

518
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,120
Rustom..

519
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,200
Age?

520
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,480
7 years...

521
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,880
Yours.

522
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,880
Who else stays at home?

523
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,800
His or mine?

524
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,800
Really now?

525
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:55,200
"Amidst this valley,"

526
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,600
"I have met many a tourists."

527
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,680
I have informed Dad the
fare for the week&nbsp;has been fixed.

528
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,096
Why did you give
me&nbsp;such a big discount?

529
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:11,360
"But the heart took
a fondness for none."

530
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,920
"I have heard many a fables."

531
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,760
They say that a cold morning
shower enhances your brain.

532
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,120
Have you ever tried?

533
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:27,360
"But meeting you was like"

534
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,600
"the meeting of scent and air."

535
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,040
You know
my grandmother used to say

536
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,440
in the presence of true love

537
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,760
our soul appears in our eyes.

538
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,720
Heard it before?

539
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,160
I don't have a grandmother.

540
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,320
Ya, so? Even I read it on Facebook.

541
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,320
She wanted me to be a wrestler

542
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,360
I could have become
one&nbsp;if I wanted to but...

543
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,040
"Feels like a sin.."

544
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:09,800
"Is it really love or what..?"

545
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,040
Are you on Facebook?

546
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,320
"But meeting you was like..."

547
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,840
Are you? She's asking you.

548
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,120
No.

549
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,040
"The meeting of scent and air."

550
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,160
"Feels like a sin.."

551
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,560
Don't you have any shame?

552
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,120
A girl is looking at&nbsp;you like that
and you won't even look back at her.

553
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,280
Stay buried in that
phone&nbsp;like lice in hair.

554
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,080
Freakin' Chowmein!

555
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,000
Rustomji...

556
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,240
Rustomji...

557
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,280
Might as well chat with you...

558
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,440
At least, you acknowledge me...

559
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:50,640
Here... no matter what...
whatever happens, even if I die

560
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,760
we're not getting
anything from here.

561
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,560
What tragedy has struck your phone that
you've forgotten to breathe, Mansoorji?

562
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,400
On Facebook...

563
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,920
Did he swallow a
phone for breakfast?

564
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,920
One second...

565
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,000
Can you get off for a minute? Easy.

566
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,080
This belongs to that pilgrim...

567
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,520
I took to Kedarnath&nbsp;this morning.
He left it behind.

568
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:26,736
I'll return it quickly and be back.

569
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,520
What do you mean return it?

570
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,240
It's a 2 hour climb up.
We've climbed down 2 hours...

571
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,240
I know, I do it everyday.

572
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,920
On a good day it's 1.5 hours.

573
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,536
So now we slowly
make our climb back up?

574
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,280
No, not you.
You and Rustom wait here.

575
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,720
I'll be back before you know it.

576
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,280
What difference does it make?
It's a phone, not a child.

577
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,440
But whenever he thinks of this pilgrimage,
there will be that one regret

578
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,376
that all was perfect, &nbsp;except
I lost my phone!

579
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,240
So?

580
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,376
So... His Shiva won't
let&nbsp;anything bad happen to him.

581
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,440
See you!

582
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,600
"Deep in the silences,"

583
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,840
"your words echo,"

584
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,240
"through my ears."

585
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,360
"And find a way into my heart."

586
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,200
"Amidst the blandness."

587
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,720
"Like finding a taste of life..."

588
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,280
Rustom is not well...

589
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:46,480
"Feels like a sin..."

590
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,360
"Is it really love or what..?"

591
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:58,400
"But meeting you was like..."

592
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:03,120
By the way... riding on Rustom is
way better than this!

593
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,280
"Feels like a sin.."

594
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:14,080
"Is it really love or what..?"

595
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,920
If milk curdles

596
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,080
and you wash your face&nbsp;with
that curdled milk

597
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,720
and look at the moon

598
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,280
then whoever you
desire will be yours.

599
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,760
What are you always thinking about?

600
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,920
The fact that...

601
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,240
I walk up and down with
the&nbsp;heaviest of loads everyday

602
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,000
but I've never
been&nbsp;burdened this much!

603
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,520
Get used to it.

604
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,280
Strange.

605
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,720
I've lost my slippers, &nbsp;bangles,
clip, handkerchief...

606
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,400
I hope Rustom hasn't&nbsp;eaten
my stuff? Bloody!

607
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,000
I wish I get wings...

608
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,680
First thing I'll clean up is the&nbsp;filth
off the face of this mountain.

609
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,560
"I find a way through you."

610
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,360
"To bow down."

611
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,240
"At God's steps."

612
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,360
"Everyone searches for him."

613
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,520
"But my eyes are set on you."

614
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,720
"You're teaching."

615
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,400
"My body the dance of the soul."

616
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,080
Hail...
- Lord Kedarnath.

617
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:52,760
"Feels like a sin."

618
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:58,640
"Is it really love or what...?"

619
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,400
"But meeting you was like"

620
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,080
"the meeting of scent and air."

621
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,440
"Feels like a sin.."

622
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:21,160
"Is it really love or what..?"

623
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,680
Rustom.

624
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,080
All the other horses are&nbsp;adorned
in beautiful fabric.

625
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,880
Why are you in this ordinary rag?

626
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,560
I don't like it!

627
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,360
Let it be known... That this royal
ride will not&nbsp;sit on ordinary garb.

628
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,160
Wear something
classy, &nbsp;then we're talking!

629
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,680
"Lilting afternoons."

630
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,960
"And the sun rising
amidst the mountains."

631
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:06,040
"I cherish spending
these with you."

632
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,080
"Lilting afternoons."

633
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,160
"And the sun rising
amidst the mountains."

634
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:22,120
"I cherish spending
these with you."

635
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,080
"Exchanging innumerous
glances and moments."

636
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,280
You turned out to be quite&nbsp;a
sweetheart, Masoor Khan!

637
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,360
"The setting sun takes
us to our destination."

638
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,600
"And the long night awaits us..."

639
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:49,000
"I cherish that I have
you with me through it all."

640
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:56,640
"You're walking by my side."

641
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,640
"How the shadow chases the sun."

642
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,600
"Feels like a sin.."

643
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,600
"Is it really love or what..?"

644
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,920
That day you called me
'Sweetheart'.

645
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,960
What does it mean?

646
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,600
I called you 'Chowmein' as well...

647
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,520
A sweetheart means one
who is closest to the heart.

648
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,400
Sweetheart.

649
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,360
Ever drunk from the sky?

650
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,760
I've tried tea.

651
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,200
Sky.

652
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,800
My grandmother used to say

653
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,280
that raindrops
unite us with blue skies.

654
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,000
Did your grandmother say that
or was it Facebook again?

655
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:20,840
My grandmother said it.

656
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,800
I was 10 when she died.

657
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,720
&nbsp;She loved the rain.

658
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,640
The day she left it rained so much.

659
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,960
It felt like it was
her&nbsp;pouring down from above.

660
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,840
Is that why you drink the rain?

661
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,920
Not just rain...
I could devour the whole sky...

662
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,640
Thief!

663
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,960
You are a thief, Mansoorji...

664
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,560
You haven't returned&nbsp;any
of my things.

665
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,920
Come... Let me give
you one&nbsp;more thing today.

666
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,040
A piece of the sky.

667
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:46,280
Are you just going to keep taking
and not give anything back?

668
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,880
I was 10.

669
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,400
I had gone with my father
to the post office

670
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,960
to post a letter to Lataji.

671
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,520
To tell her

672
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,480
that when she sings...

673
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:11,440
it feels like the whole valley,

674
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,840
our whole existence
has become beautiful.

675
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,800
When Dad used to hum...

676
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,240
It used to feel like...

677
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,960
His soul would appear in his eyes.

678
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,440
Ma never listens to it...

679
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,360
But if I hear it
even a 1,000 times,

680
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,000
it's not enough.

681
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:53,080
"Today we have been bestowed
these moments through destiny."

682
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:03,680
"With all your heart, get an eyeful
of me, up close."

683
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:14,120
"Who knows if destiny will
bring us a night&nbsp;like this again."

684
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:24,720
"I wonder in this lifetime
will we meet again or not."

685
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,800
"I long for your embrace..."

686
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,416
Considering the increasing
number of pilgrims

687
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,520
and the need for more amenities,
this plan has been passed.

688
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,240
5-6 shops will be put
up from your end as well.

689
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:09,360
For the prosperity of the people in the
valley, we are proposing this plan.

690
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,440
That is very generous of you,
Kulluji.

691
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,640
And who will care for the valley?

692
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,640
We don't get a permit
to build here because

693
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,240
the valley won't
be able to take it.

694
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:22,440
What did you say your name was?

695
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:23,560
I am Mansoor.

696
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,600
And... My shop is in that area too.

697
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,480
Mansoor.

698
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,760
You won't understand our devotion.

699
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,680
Excuse me?

700
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,760
You won't understand
our devotion to serve.

701
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,800
Pilgrims come here on
a&nbsp;pilgrimage to meet their God

702
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,240
and taking care
of&nbsp;them is our duty.

703
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:41,960
But how will you know this?

704
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,600
Why won't I know it?

705
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:48,320
We do service too
we help in pilgrimage, Kulluji!

706
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:49,400
So what should we do?

707
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:51,160
Stop the pilgrimage?

708
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
No!

709
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,920
Limit it.

710
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,960
Every year allow only that many
pilgrims as we can take care of...

711
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:00,336
Neither will the valley
be&nbsp;burdened, nor the people.

712
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,360
Oh!

713
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,880
So 'Mansoor' will tell us how
and when we&nbsp;should meet our God.

714
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,520
We are getting work, Mansoor

715
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:11,480
why are you opposing it?

716
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,880
It's about the pilgrimage
and facilities.

717
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,880
Even God wants us to progress!

718
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,800
Progress and profit
go hand in hand.

719
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,240
This is profit from pilgrimage.

720
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,640
If a valley in which God Himself
resides is not valued, then...

721
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,160
where will He go?

722
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,240
When there is profit
from pilgrimage...

723
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,200
everybody prospers.

724
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,240
The Pandavas...
came here for penance.

725
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,840
The pilgrims... To find liberation.

726
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,400
The ones who are destined&nbsp;to
make it to these holy places...

727
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
Amarnath,

728
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:48,640
Kedarnath

729
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,800
is due to Shiva's wishes...

730
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,040
And when He wishes,
who are we to stop anyone?

731
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,280
Whenever our heart desires,
we will come on this pilgrimage.

732
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,936
And as many of them come, we will
make provisions for all of them.

733
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,560
And who are you to come between us?

734
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,680
'Between us'?

735
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,960
We've always been here.

736
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,080
With you...

737
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:13,280
What do you mean 'between'?

738
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,240
The cave of Amarnath
was first found by Buta Malik.

739
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,480
Even today,
offerings are sent to his family.

740
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,360
My people have served&nbsp;here
for generations.

741
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,320
We have been part
of their devotion...

742
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,480
We've carried pilgrims
on our shoulders.

743
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,360
Chanted "Om Namah Shivay"
along the way.

744
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,960
Whispered Shiva's name in the ears&nbsp;of
pilgrims breathing their last.

745
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,440
How will you separate us?

746
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,800
This pilgrimage runs in our blood.

747
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,080
And this is not about you and me.
This is about all of Kedarnath.

748
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:54,360
Shiva, Shiva, Shiva!

749
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,720
Praise Lord Shiva!

750
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,280
Hail the Mighty One!

751
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,800
Hail the Mighty One!

752
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,680
Hail the Untainted One!

753
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,200
Heard you made quite
an impact at the meeting...

754
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,480
Had I not spoken they would
have said be more like your father

755
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,160
voice your opinions

756
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,160
and when I said something

757
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,040
it blew up!

758
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,720
I wonder how my father
dealt with all this.

759
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,000
So, since your father died,

760
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,480
you haven't watched
any match on T.V.?

761
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,000
Mansoor!

762
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,840
The temple is not too far away...

763
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,160
Not today. Today is
the India-Pakistan match.

764
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,520
We have a radio.
We can listen together.

765
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,320
Listening on the radio is more fun.

766
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,520
He left us forever.

767
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,440
And you will leave too.

768
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,800
Are you sending me to your father?

769
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,160
I'm not even married yet.

770
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,600
You will leave with somebody else.

771
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,280
When the time comes.

772
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,400
Here.

773
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,120
Now I'm stuck to you like a leech.

774
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,200
No amount of salt can separate us.

775
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,200
Now I'll always be sucking
your blood, Mansoor Khan.

776
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,240
You can't stay with me...

777
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,680
can't dance with joy
or cry in grief with me...

778
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,200
or be by my side.

779
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,000
This partner can dance,

780
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,880
can cry
and can also rock your world!

781
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,880
Tell me,
what grief do I have to be part of?

782
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,480
I am ready to cry.

783
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:16,200
Tell me the time and place.

784
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,360
Will you be part of my joy?

785
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,600
A very close friend is
getting married, so I thought...

786
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,120
I just said it...

787
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,360
Words mean nothing.

788
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:34,640
I'll be there.

789
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,960
You should be arrested
for giving false hope, Mukkuji...

790
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,600
And if I show up

791
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,240
then you're going in for life,
Mansoor Khan.

792
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,200
"Beaming eyes and
that mesmerizing face!"

793
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,880
"What has taken over me, my God!"

794
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:37,600
"Like an icing on a cake,"

795
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,400
"there is truly nobody like her."

796
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:45,200
"Adorned in regal trousseau,
you walk in and how!"

797
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,800
"That's my Sweetheart right there!"

798
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,600
"Coy and Shy,"

799
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,680
"sitting besides the bride."

800
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:56,160
"That's my Sweetheart right there!"

801
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,160
"Adorned in regal trousseau,
you walk in and how!"

802
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:03,720
"That's my Sweetheart right there!"

803
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,920
"Coy and Shy,"

804
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,600
"sitting besides the bride."

805
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,800
"That's my Sweetheart right there!"

806
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,280
"How do I thank you
for everything."

807
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,880
"I owe it all to you."

808
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:37,600
"You walked into my humble home."

809
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,360
"And became the life of the night."

810
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,040
"How do I thank you
for everything?"

811
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,560
"I owe it all to you."

812
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,360
"You walked into my humble home."

813
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,040
"And became the life of the night."

814
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,960
"In this night of
love and festivity,"

815
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,760
"you bring prosperity."

816
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,320
"You bring auspicion."

817
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:11,320
"She has become the
soul of the gathering."

818
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,040
"What has taken over me, my God!"

819
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,800
"She has become this
humble man's biggest desire."

820
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,480
"There is truly nobody like her!"

821
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,440
"Adorned in regal trousseau,"

822
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,320
"you walk in and how!"

823
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,000
"That's my Sweetheart right there!"

824
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:31,000
"Coy and Shy,"

825
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:33,840
"sitting besides the bride."

826
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:37,160
"That's my Sweetheart right there!"

827
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,440
"Adorned in regal trousseau,"

828
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,240
"you walk in and how!"

829
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,840
"That's my Sweetheart right there!"

830
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,920
"Coy and Shy,"

831
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,720
"sitting besides the bride."

832
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:07,480
"That's my Sweetheart right there!"

833
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,160
"Wow! It's just awesome!"

834
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:15,400
"Wow! It's wonderful!"

835
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,160
Are you Mansoor?

836
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,200
Are you Mukku's daily ride?

837
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:41,200
She's my sister younger.

838
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,000
I know her inside out.

839
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,720
Every month some poor guy shows up
to ask for her hand.

840
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,160
This month no one came,
so I thought I'll see for myself,

841
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:50,680
who is next.

842
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:52,800
And tell him

843
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,120
to concentrate on
his work and his job.

844
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:58,600
There is nothing here for you.

845
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,160
Why are you so shocked,
Mansoor Khan?

846
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,800
Even your mule would
have better sense.

847
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,440
She is the daughter
of a Hindu Priest...

848
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:25,560
Mukku!

849
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,920
Leave that.

850
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Take this upstairs.

851
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:33,000
This new obsession...

852
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:36,240
All the time on the phone...
Click-click-click-click!

853
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,920
If the geyser is spoilt

854
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,840
why not take Shiva's name
and go for a dip in the Ganges?

855
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,840
Only if Mukku will bring
hot water will they bathe.

856
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,120
Where's the fire?

857
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:50,240
Time to end the Rambara story.
Uncle is better now.

858
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:53,520
Mind your own business.

859
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,400
And don't wait for him tomorrow.
He won't come.

860
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,880
What?

861
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,360
Mukkuji,
if you have moves like a snake...

862
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,000
you deserve to be trapped
in a snake charmer's box.

863
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:07,440
You like playing these love games?

864
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,160
Well... It will cost you.

865
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,040
You'll fall straight
on your face one day!

866
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,360
Why did you say don't wait for him?

867
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,480
I've told him everything
and all about your ways.

868
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,600
That it's your hobby to trap boys.

869
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,360
He won't be seeing
you from tomorrow.

870
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,240
What I do with him
is none of your business.

871
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,680
Didn't you Mukku?
Interfere in my life?

872
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,560
Oh! Spewed out the poison?

873
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,960
You blame me?

874
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:45,640
Kullu left you, that's why?

875
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,240
Yes. - I trapped Kullu,
Mansoor and everyone else!

876
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:50,560
Happy?

877
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,080
Oh Wise One...
Where is Mansoor?

878
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:06,320
Oh Wise One...
Where is Mansoor?

879
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,040
You know...

880
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,440
If I did, would I ask?

881
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,200
You know where he is...

882
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:16,840
And you will send him there,
where he is meant to go.

883
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,040
Mansoor...

884
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,120
Mansoor!

885
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:20,760
Listen to me...

886
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:23,880
Mansoor...

887
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,800
Will you listen to me?

888
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,920
I know my sister
has spewed her venom...

889
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,920
I admit, 2 or 3 well-meaning
men did come to ask for my hand...

890
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:36,480
No, 4...

891
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,680
Alright, 5!

892
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,160
That too for some other reason...

893
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,920
to embarass my father and Kullu.

894
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,640
Listen...

895
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,800
They got me engaged to Kullu, even
though he's been my sister's fiance

896
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,080
I was going to tell you...

897
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,160
Shut up!

898
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,680
Is this all a game to you?

899
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,560
You can do what you like,
say what like?

900
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,360
Disrespectful, mannerless, selfish.
I can't call you these names

901
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,881
because the whole valley
belongs to you and your father...

902
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,480
And yes... Mandakiniji...

903
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,160
If your next victim
is one the priests,

904
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,840
we will be grateful.

905
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:48,360
"My endless love for you
won't break me down."

906
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:53,560
"My insanity won't break me down."

907
00:59:53,760 --> 01:00:01,760
"What will break me
beyond death is your sorrow."

908
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:10,680
"Why have you become so hurt?"

909
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:15,960
"What has taken over you?"

910
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:24,240
"What will break me
beyond death is your sorrow"

911
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,400
India won! India won!

912
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,280
"I bestow my life to you, my love."

913
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:38,000
"I bestow my life to you."

914
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:42,520
"I bestow my life to you."

915
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:06,720
"I have cut my ties
with the universe."

916
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:11,200
"And kept all my love for you."

917
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,960
Where is Mukku?
Haven't seen her since morning...

918
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,160
Uncle called.
He needed her at the store.

919
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:18,256
She'll be back by evening.

920
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:21,840
"I have proven it all,
I have stood through it all."

921
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:29,520
"I leave it to you now.
Show me your love."

922
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,960
"Show me your love once."

923
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,200
You would believe anybody
else's lies over me?

924
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,440
Was she there

925
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,200
where we were?

926
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,040
Was she there?

927
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,880
Was she there... where we were?

928
01:01:58,120 --> 01:01:59,520
Was she?

929
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,120
How could you believe her?

930
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:07,280
No one will accept
this relationship.

931
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,880
Will you?

932
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:23,880
"I bestow my life to you, my love.
I bestow my life to you."

933
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:34,040
"I bestow my life to you, my love.
I bestow my life to you."

934
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:43,280
"I bestow my life to our love,
my love."

935
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,040
Mansoor... Get rid of this girl.

936
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,920
Mansoor!

937
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,080
Mansoor...

938
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,960
Ma, please forgive me for this.

939
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,120
Mansoor...

940
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,240
What are you doing, Mansoor?

941
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:39,520
There will be mayhem.

942
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
You will get all
of us into trouble!

943
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,640
Mansoor, this is wrong...
- Yes it's wrong...

944
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,920
Everything is wrong.

945
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,240
She is an outcast,
shrewd, manipulative...

946
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,200
but she can devour the whole sky.

947
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,520
It's hot.

948
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:10,960
Where is Mukku?

949
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,760
What happened?

950
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:14,040
Do you know where she is?

951
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,520
Yes... She is down at
the shop with her Uncle

952
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,720
and then to her friend's.

953
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,280
Brinda was saying...

954
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,000
She's talking rubbish!

955
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,320
Brinda?

956
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,480
Since when is this on?

957
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:39,680
Why?

958
01:04:40,360 --> 01:04:42,360
You think only you can play games?

959
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:45,760
Where is he?

960
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,320
With her lover.

961
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:49,400
In his arms.

962
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,960
You know who he is.

963
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,080
What has happened?

964
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,520
Where is Mukku?

965
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,200
You know that porter...

966
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:05,880
who used to go
around ringing bells?

967
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,880
She's with him...

968
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,520
in his house.

969
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,520
Brijraaj can't believe it.

970
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:13,880
He's her lover.

971
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:14,960
Kullu!

972
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,080
I've confirmed this
news with the porters.

973
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,360
What's the problem, noble Priest?

974
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:28,360
Earlier you've been so
generous with your blessings.

975
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,240
First you gave him the bell

976
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,120
now give him your daughter too.

977
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,080
Come outside, Mansoor!

978
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:39,560
Come outside!

979
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,440
Brijrajji...

980
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,560
Mandakini?
Where is she?

981
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,920
Brijrajji, let's speak calmly...

982
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:46,800
Where's the girl?

983
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,840
Kulluji... this is a family matter.

984
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,360
Yes, it is.

985
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,200
She's my daughter.
- And my fiancé!

986
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,240
We'll remove all
you porters from here

987
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,320
with your families.

988
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,360
What does this have
to do with the porters?

989
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,640
When a Muslim porter's son

990
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,760
lays his hand on a
Hindu Priest's daughter,

991
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,800
should we all sing hymns together?

992
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,800
We will uproot each
and every one of you!

993
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,520
Everyone need not get involved...

994
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,480
Ameena has spoken to the
shopkeepers. They will leave.

995
01:06:11,560 --> 01:06:13,400
They will leave this place!

996
01:06:13,480 --> 01:06:14,840
Stop Kullu.

997
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:18,280
Kullu...
- Kulluji!

998
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,040
I feel crushed.

999
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:34,800
And just look at her...

1000
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:38,280
She's become numb.

1001
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:40,840
Overnight, she's turned to stone.

1002
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,600
Enough!

1003
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:05,160
Stop this madness, Mukku.

1004
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,840
Don't make it a spectacle.

1005
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:10,800
The show has just begun.

1006
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:36,040
Mansoor.

1007
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,360
Mansoor.

1008
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:40,040
Mansoor.

1009
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:42,840
Mansoor.

1010
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,520
Mansoor.
- Enough!

1011
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:46,360
Quiet...

1012
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,640
The idea of being a
rebel may sound romantic...

1013
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,160
but it has destroyed
the best of them.

1014
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:55,640
Forget all this, Mukku.

1015
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,080
Let it go.

1016
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,240
Again. Aain those same words.

1017
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:04,600
You never stood up for me,
at least do it for her?

1018
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,680
You sacrificed me,
but at least save her.

1019
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:42,080
Please forgive me
if I made a mistake...

1020
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,640
Mukku and I...

1021
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,720
How dare you enter my house?

1022
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:49,920
Sir...

1023
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:56,520
Give it to him!

1024
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,920
He's reached here!

1025
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,440
Do something... They'll kill him!

1026
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:27,600
If he can't handle this much, how
will he deal with what's to come?

1027
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,520
Mansoor! Mansoor!

1028
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,120
Leave him... Stop it!
Please stop... I beg you, stop.

1029
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,560
No, Kulluji. Don't beat him.

1030
01:11:47,640 --> 01:11:50,360
He made a mistake!
Please forgive him...

1031
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,120
Kulluji he will die...

1032
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,240
Kulluji please forgive us...

1033
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,640
You won't see him here again...

1034
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:41,440
Lata...

1035
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,560
get ready...

1036
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,960
she's getting married tomorrow.

1037
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:52,360
You just had him beaten
him up so severely...

1038
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,280
give him a few days to recover.

1039
01:12:55,360 --> 01:12:57,880
Is there any limit
to your shamelessness?

1040
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,200
You stripped me of all shame the
day you got me engaged to Kullu.

1041
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,040
If you let me marry Mansoor...
- That is impossible!

1042
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,880
Even if all hell breaks loose...

1043
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,920
Then I shall pray day
and night that it does...

1044
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:18,560
Tomorrow morning 8 am
is the auspicious time...

1045
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,880
9 am... farewell...

1046
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,080
after that never show
me your cursed face again!

1047
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,760
Roy. A warning has been issued.

1048
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:41,440
What nonsense!

1049
01:13:41,680 --> 01:13:43,016
The guide said
everything is normal...

1050
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,240
It's okay to go up.

1051
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,760
A few websites have
issued a warning.

1052
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,280
Leave Rambara and everything here
take Mansoor and leave.

1053
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,680
The others have signed up
everyone is in agreement.

1054
01:13:56,160 --> 01:13:58,560
If you don't leave, it will
affect everyone's livelihood.

1055
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,360
They will make our
lives difficult.

1056
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,480
Done?

1057
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:04,640
You will have an answer soon.

1058
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:14,200
Everyone has left us.

1059
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,280
They all want us to leave.

1060
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,480
I told you so.

1061
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:23,520
Have you understood?

1062
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,280
We'll go away from here.

1063
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,960
We'll leave this valley.

1064
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:10,040
We'll move to one of the cities.

1065
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:12,760
Mansoor?

1066
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:14,680
Mansoor where are you going?

1067
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:17,640
Mansoor we are leaving today...
- We aren't going anywhere!

1068
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,880
I've told Kailash Bhai,
we are not leaving home.

1069
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:23,520
I will not leave without Mukku.

1070
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:24,880
Mansoor!

1071
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:28,840
Mansoor!

1072
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,200
Set me on fire...

1073
01:16:36,040 --> 01:16:37,440
Or forget about her.

1074
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:31,280
The porters haven't replied...

1075
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:35,760
and Mansoor has
refused to give the shop.

1076
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:04,400
It's coming down really hard.

1077
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,760
Sit down. I have to get even.

1078
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,320
Sir, may I come in?

1079
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:30,040
Sir, a cyclonic circulation
caused by a low-lying...

1080
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,920
area in the Bay of
Bengal is headed west...

1081
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:35,280
Have a look Sir,
the pressure is dropping fast.

1082
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:13,760
Mukku!

1083
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:18,280
Mukku!

1084
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:21,680
Ma!

1085
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:30,760
Mukku.

1086
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:35,720
They enter our temples...

1087
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,200
Our homes...

1088
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,680
And we should be quiet?

1089
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:43,520
Every member of this commission,
know this...

1090
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:46,160
We will not let a single
porterremain in Rambara

1091
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:48,240
unless our conditions are met.

1092
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:55,160
Hail the Innocent One!

1093
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,600
Hail the Innocent One!
- Hail the Innocent One!

1094
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,160
Hail the Innocent One!
- Hail the Innocent One!

1095
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:05,680
Hail the Innocent One!
- Hail the Innocent One!

1096
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,040
Hail the Innocent One!

1097
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,160
Break it down...
- Get out of here.

1098
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:14,560
Destroy everything.

1099
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,880
Get out of here.

1100
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,240
This isn't right...

1101
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,360
What is happening here?

1102
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,480
Where is Mansoor hiding?
He will leave now!

1103
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,960
Let's resolve this calmly...

1104
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:38,360
Mansoor, let it go.

1105
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,640
Does the wound of Mukku's
rejection run so deep

1106
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,456
that you need to burn
the place down to fill it?

1107
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:48,680
You and your kind, both
will be eradicated from here.

1108
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,000
And as for Mukku...

1109
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,640
She has married me.

1110
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:57,600
She would rather
die than marry you.

1111
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:00,400
She has married me.

1112
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,200
And now she will die too...

1113
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:04,480
She has slit her wrist.

1114
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:07,480
Kullu, calm down.
Everyone will leave.

1115
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,360
Hail the Innocent One!
- Hail the Innocent One!

1116
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:32,800
Lo! I hear the beating of
Shiva's drum... It has begun...

1117
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,440
It can be heard through
heaven and earth...

1118
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:41,120
We choose our death
before we are born.

1119
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,680
Shiva is in us!

1120
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:47,200
This is not me, it is You.

1121
01:21:48,560 --> 01:21:51,720
This is not me, it is You.

1122
01:21:59,720 --> 01:22:01,320
What did you do?

1123
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:11,160
Get well soon so I can kill you...

1124
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:15,680
I'm going to drop Maand
and come back for you.

1125
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,360
They got me married.

1126
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,600
If I live,
you'll have to see me go to him.

1127
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,680
I don't care!

1128
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,800
Wherever you are,
I will come and get you.

1129
01:22:32,240 --> 01:22:33,920
Don't die on me.

1130
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:39,960
This time if you're late...

1131
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:49,080
Ma?

1132
01:24:49,400 --> 01:24:51,240
Mukku, come outside.
- Ma?

1133
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,960
Hurry!

1134
01:24:57,760 --> 01:24:59,760
Mukku.
- Come on.

1135
01:25:00,600 --> 01:25:01,880
Let's go upstairs, Mukku.

1136
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,720
Be careful.

1137
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,080
Ma, hurry up.
- Mukku, come on.

1138
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,640
Take all the tourists up.
- Come on.

1139
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,160
Hurry!

1140
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:11,520
Take it easy.

1141
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:13,360
Watch out.

1142
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,240
Come, come.

1143
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,680
Go up everyone.

1144
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:30,160
Mukku, here pass this on.

1145
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,760
Anyone else?

1146
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,120
Take this.

1147
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,280
No.

1148
01:26:04,360 --> 01:26:08,360
Bala, Divesh,
everyone head up the forest!

1149
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:10,560
Toward the forest.
- Afzar, stick with Ma.

1150
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,760
Come on. Come on. Hurry!

1151
01:26:16,360 --> 01:26:18,600
Aunt, you stay with me.

1152
01:26:46,280 --> 01:26:48,040
Come, come with me.

1153
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,320
Be careful.

1154
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:56,200
Don't worry.

1155
01:26:58,480 --> 01:27:01,120
Everything will be fine.
Don't worry.

1156
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,160
Mukku, sit down!

1157
01:27:18,440 --> 01:27:19,640
Watch out!

1158
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:22,160
Maa, what is going on?

1159
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:25,920
Mukku! sit.

1160
01:27:34,200 --> 01:27:37,520
Ma!

1161
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:51,080
Bindu!

1162
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:53,960
Bindu.

1163
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:36,880
Mukku!

1164
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,280
Ma, I'll be back...
- No Mansoor...

1165
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:00,880
You can't save everyone!

1166
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:03,040
Ma, not now. I have to go...

1167
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,600
Promise me you'll be safe...

1168
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:09,440
I will Ma...

1169
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:34,640
Son... you can say
your prayers here too.

1170
01:33:38,240 --> 01:33:39,400
Mukku?

1171
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:42,280
Mukku...

1172
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:43,560
Mansoor?

1173
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:45,520
Mukku...
- Mansoor!

1174
01:33:45,880 --> 01:33:47,280
Mukku...

1175
01:34:09,720 --> 01:34:11,040
Mansoor!

1176
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:12,400
Mansoor!

1177
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,760
Mansoor!
- Mukku!

1178
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,720
Mukku!

1179
01:36:42,680 --> 01:36:45,600
Help, please help!

1180
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:47,760
Help.

1181
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:55,360
Anyone here?

1182
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,880
Careful.

1183
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06,520
Keep walking,

1184
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,720
Are you okay son?

1185
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,040
Son, be careful.

1186
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:03,640
Careful.

1187
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:23,440
Go.

1188
01:38:24,040 --> 01:38:25,280
Go up.

1189
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,560
You guys go first.

1190
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:29,360
Go fast.
- Papa!

1191
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,160
I am coming, you go up.
- Papa! Mummy!

1192
01:38:35,360 --> 01:38:36,600
Papa!

1193
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,480
You go mukku.

1194
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,400
Move back!

1195
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,200
You go.

1196
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,040
Don't worry, Mukku.
Everything will be fine.

1197
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:41,920
Hold on tight.
- Mansoor!

1198
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,720
You go up first.

1199
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:03,400
Careful, give me the belt.

1200
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:04,880
Where is Papa?

1201
01:40:12,720 --> 01:40:14,240
You go first please.

1202
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:15,360
You go.
- Fast.

1203
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,840
Fast. Come up fast.
- You go please.

1204
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:25,640
Only one more!

1205
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:27,320
Okay sir.

1206
01:40:27,440 --> 01:40:29,400
What did he just say?
- Only one more can come up.

1207
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:30,760
What is that mean?

1208
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:32,936
There are two people down there!
- Please keep sitting.

1209
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:35,200
Sit back down.
- What do you mean?

1210
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:39,760
You please sit here,
only one more can come up.

1211
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,200
Please try to understand.

1212
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,200
We can only take
one more person with us.

1213
01:40:45,680 --> 01:40:47,040
Please move aside.

1214
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:48,000
Please calm down.

1215
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,400
Papa!

1216
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,160
Mansoor!

1217
01:40:52,080 --> 01:40:53,960
Mansoor!
- Papa!

1218
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,080
Papa!

1219
01:41:03,960 --> 01:41:06,920
Papa, please come up fast.

1220
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,800
Get inside.
- Papa, please come up fast.

1221
01:41:09,880 --> 01:41:13,480
Son, go back inside.
- Papa, please come up.

1222
01:41:22,240 --> 01:41:23,720
Papa!

1223
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:28,280
No, Mansoor.

1224
01:41:30,480 --> 01:41:32,960
Mansoor, please come up.

1225
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:37,720
Please, Mansoor.

1226
01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,480
Mansoor.

1227
01:41:51,960 --> 01:41:53,800
Mansoor!

1228
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:19,080
Ma, Papa is coming up.

1229
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,920
Papa!

1230
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,760
Mansoor!

1231
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,160
Mansoor!

1232
01:44:04,720 --> 01:44:06,640
'Kedarnath is completely
destroyed.'

1233
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:09,280
'Kedarnath is devastated by flood.'

1234
01:45:15,400 --> 01:45:17,600
Hail...
