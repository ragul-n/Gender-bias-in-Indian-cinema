1
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:12,800
'Spear beats NOT AND MIND "

2
00:01:21,633 --> 00:01:25,175
"Aruvankadu"

3
00:01:27,175 --> 00:01:28,800
Enough.

4
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:35,092
Why do not you eat? The phone rings.

5
00:01:37,092 --> 00:01:38,217
Hello?

6
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,717
I'll take care of it.

7
00:01:45,092 --> 00:01:45,800
What happened?

8
00:01:46,217 --> 00:01:48,675
Your brother got out of prison.

9
00:01:48,758 --> 00:01:51,883
After all these years, you have not forgiven him?

10
00:01:52,258 --> 00:01:52,883
Do not go away.

11
00:01:52,967 --> 00:01:54,467
I calm down only
after I kill him.

12
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,842
No! Do not do this.
Listen to me, please.

13
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:56,717
Get away!

14
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:05,050
My brother was disgraced and
imprisoned the husband of my sister.

15
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,342
My brother himself must kill his son in law.

16
00:02:07,425 --> 00:02:08,800
Your son-Rathnavel came to our village.

17
00:02:08,883 --> 00:02:09,758
Hey, let's.

18
00:02:09,925 --> 00:02:11,008
Come with me.

19
00:02:11,092 --> 00:02:15,175
The gnevatsya can better
calm his brother?

20
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:17,383
No matter what, he is the husband of your sister.

21
00:02:17,467 --> 00:02:18,092
Hey!

22
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,592
After marrying me and having given
birth to my two children...

23
00:02:20,675 --> 00:02:22,758
... You still do not znash that for
us the family's prestige and pride?

24
00:02:23,342 --> 00:02:27,925
When it is a question of hostility,
relatives and friends are not important.

25
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:31,842
An eye for an eye, a life for a life.

26
00:02:42,758 --> 00:02:43,800
Come on!

27
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:26,717
Lakshmi?

28
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:31,383
Dear! What happened? Oh my God!

29
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,133
You have not listened to me
when I told you not to go.

30
00:03:33,217 --> 00:03:35,258
Let's hurry to the hospital.

31
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,050
Let's go.

32
00:03:38,467 --> 00:03:40,092
Let's go to the hospital.

33
00:03:40,467 --> 00:03:42,467
I killed your brother.

34
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:44,217
For me, that's enough.

35
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,675
Why are you?

36
00:03:46,758 --> 00:03:49,633
Tell my son about our ancestry.

37
00:03:49,842 --> 00:03:52,175
Save it for me.

38
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,508
No, please.

39
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,342
Give me a son.

40
00:03:57,967 --> 00:04:00,258
No.

41
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:02,425
Give it to me.

42
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:08,050
My God!

43
00:04:11,842 --> 00:04:13,050
Dear!

44
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,050
There is no one in the house, sir.
Only Rathnavela corpse.

45
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:30,967
Dharma, Cali.

46
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,508
Hey!

47
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:39,675
Even after many years, we
should not forget this enmity.

48
00:04:39,883 --> 00:04:44,092
No matter how much time passes...

49
00:04:44,258 --> 00:04:47,050
How long it may take...

50
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:50,967
... You have to bury the
heir of the family.

51
00:04:51,217 --> 00:04:53,967
Promise me now.

52
00:05:05,008 --> 00:05:09,717
"27 years later"

53
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,300
Aloo, is the provider of water Kumaresan?

54
00:05:18,383 --> 00:05:20,467
- Tell me, brother. - What should I say?

55
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,217
You put only ten bottles of water.
Where are the others?

56
00:05:23,425 --> 00:05:25,675
Is Shakti has not delivered
the water this morning?

57
00:05:25,842 --> 00:05:26,633
In your dreams!

58
00:05:27,258 --> 00:05:29,675
Brought in time, otherwise
I change supplier.

59
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:30,842
So hard you have to deal.

60
00:05:30,925 --> 00:05:32,008
Brother... Brother... Brother!

61
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,675
Can I get water today or not?

62
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:36,758
I ask my boyfriend
is now to deliver.

63
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:39,050
Do not you bring, I'll send it back!

64
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:39,550
No, it's...

65
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:40,883
Just fetch and I will pay the bill.

66
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,258
Where the hell happened to Shakti?

67
00:09:33,133 --> 00:09:34,758
Hey Shakti!

68
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:35,675
What?

69
00:09:35,758 --> 00:09:38,633
The Boss shouting themselves hoarse in the
throat, that you brought tanks. Go faster.

70
00:09:39,258 --> 00:09:40,300
My God!

71
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:44,842
"You danced like skipjack.
Now your jeans will be erased in the dust."

72
00:09:47,425 --> 00:09:53,008
"Hey! Careful. Yama left, you can not see?"

73
00:09:55,717 --> 00:09:57,258
Five cylinders brother.

74
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:58,383
Good, good.

75
00:09:58,758 --> 00:10:01,258
"Be careful."

76
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:03,092
- When are you coming? - In a few minutes.

77
00:10:04,508 --> 00:10:07,425
Hurry!

78
00:10:08,592 --> 00:10:13,467
"My back will not sustain the load.
Only three cylinders on the road."

79
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:18,133
"Keep your distance."

80
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:42,175
Do you know where the school
opposite Jeeva Nagar?

81
00:10:42,383 --> 00:10:44,800
Where the temple with a crypt.

82
00:10:44,883 --> 00:10:46,967
- Temple? - Near Shanti Nagar.

83
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,050
I swear, I do not understand.

84
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,092
What brother?

85
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,633
He wants to know the way in Shanti Nagar?

86
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,092
Blinolitsy! Come here.

87
00:10:52,717 --> 00:10:53,842
Do you know where the "Wine Guru"?

88
00:10:53,925 --> 00:10:55,842
- Yes. - If you go straight out...

89
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:56,967
... And you will roll twice to the
left, you will reach "Suguna Wine".

90
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,633
Yes.

91
00:10:57,717 --> 00:10:59,633
If you go straight on, you will
come to the "Wine of the Nile."

92
00:10:59,717 --> 00:11:00,883
There is this bar.

93
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,008
Next to it is Shanti Nagar.

94
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:05,217
You have to speak in a manner
that is easily understandable.

95
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,092
Brother's best attractions
is wine shops.

96
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:09,383
Now do you understand?

97
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:10,675
Try to develop your brain.

98
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:12,383
Hey! Go.

99
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:20,050
In the darkness, I can not
even see if the boss inside!

100
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:30,300
Where have you been?

101
00:11:30,592 --> 00:11:33,592
Enough to deliver cylinders in
pieces on this dilapidated bicycle.

102
00:11:33,883 --> 00:11:35,925
You do not work here anymore.
You're fired.

103
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:40,425
"You lost a job, dude. Hip hip hooray."

104
00:11:42,717 --> 00:11:46,508
The employee must fill
the wallet of its owner.

105
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,883
Because you just yell at me.
Why should I hold you?

106
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:51,800
How many times have I
told you to buy a truck?

107
00:11:51,883 --> 00:11:53,092
You were deaf.

108
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,883
I deliver water through
small streets.

109
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,425
Do not I work like a buffalo?

110
00:11:59,758 --> 00:12:02,675
I do not deny it, you're a hard worker.

111
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:04,217
But you have to use their brains.

112
00:12:04,383 --> 00:12:07,008
Take as many balloons as you want.
Deliver them to where you want.

113
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:08,592
I will give you additional points.

114
00:12:08,675 --> 00:12:10,508
But you have to buy a truck.

115
00:12:11,175 --> 00:12:14,008
I'm not rich enough to buy it!

116
00:12:14,092 --> 00:12:16,675
But you love to spend
money on a shirt, right?

117
00:12:16,717 --> 00:12:18,342
Undermining some money, son.

118
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:21,425
Owner. Boss...

119
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,508
If he returns with his
decrepit bicycle...

120
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:26,342
... Do not let him cylinders for delivery.

121
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:27,675
Yes, sir.

122
00:12:28,592 --> 00:12:33,300
Jewelry Princess Diana were exhibited
at the show at London museum.

123
00:12:33,383 --> 00:12:36,800
Do you hear that? They
show the crown jewels.

124
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:40,217
If the husband of Diana was a drunk, like you...

125
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,258
... Jewelry would not be in a
museum, and in a pawnshop.

126
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:46,133
Why do you discuss
world news spender ?!

127
00:12:46,217 --> 00:12:46,717
Go for a walk.

128
00:12:46,883 --> 00:12:48,633
I'm here to discuss a
very important issue.

129
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:50,717
Good afternoon.

130
00:12:51,925 --> 00:12:55,883
To them did not steal...

131
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,717
... You chain hitched to his points.

132
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,175
Where is your son?

133
00:13:00,342 --> 00:13:03,383
In Kolature I opened it a huge store.

134
00:13:03,675 --> 00:13:04,467
Shop "Parrot"?

135
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,217
No, huge, it means "big".

136
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,550
Oh! Big store!

137
00:13:06,633 --> 00:13:09,592
I would really like to know!
Do financier Can be...

138
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:13,008
... Officers, policemen,
or karate master?

139
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:15,217
They are to work must be strong.

140
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:18,008
Are you sitting on a chair and
moving musklami, fill your coffers.

141
00:13:18,092 --> 00:13:19,550
We are not interested in this.

142
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,342
Are you interested
only lend at interest!

143
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:25,217
You have come to redeem his cell phone?

144
00:13:25,425 --> 00:13:27,092
Pay hundred rupees and take it.

145
00:13:27,342 --> 00:13:28,842
I did not come here because of the mobile phone.

146
00:13:29,383 --> 00:13:32,175
You give loans for the purchase of a car?

147
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:33,842
I need a truck.

148
00:13:34,008 --> 00:13:36,342
I will regularly pay each month.

149
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,717
Do you have fifty thousand collateral?

150
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,008
Your face is shining with joy,
when you say "the pledge."

151
00:13:42,175 --> 00:13:44,258
If I had money, I
would come here?

152
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:47,008
Give me the full amount.
I have it fully repaid.

153
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:50,092
Shakti, without money nothing can be done.

154
00:13:50,175 --> 00:13:51,425
But I want to get a loan!

155
00:13:51,508 --> 00:13:52,550
For this I have come to you.

156
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:54,842
Go tell it to someone.
People will laugh at you.

157
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,050
I again repeat my request.

158
00:13:56,217 --> 00:13:57,717
You laugh and we agree.

159
00:13:57,883 --> 00:13:59,425
Do not be angry.

160
00:13:59,592 --> 00:14:01,008
You know me since childhood.

161
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,467
Who else can help me except you?

162
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,467
Though once help.

163
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,383
Shakti, enough chatter.

164
00:14:06,717 --> 00:14:08,842
You're an orphan. You have no one.

165
00:14:09,425 --> 00:14:12,383
I can not give you
credit on parole.

166
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,883
Please, go away.

167
00:14:16,092 --> 00:14:17,342
- Sir... - Do not waste your time.

168
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:18,300
Get out.

169
00:14:23,092 --> 00:14:25,383
Hello? Speak.

170
00:14:25,717 --> 00:14:27,133
Yes, I will come.

171
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:41,925
Shakti!

172
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:48,508
Do not locked house, you
Delache here on the terrace?

173
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:51,550
I was told Central
Station for sale.

174
00:14:51,633 --> 00:14:54,592
I wonder, should buy it or not.

175
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:56,717
I can only work if
I have a truck.

176
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,383
So he tells me Kumerasan.

177
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:00,842
- Who is it? - My owner.

178
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,633
I can not blame him, uncle.

179
00:15:03,925 --> 00:15:06,508
His father opened his office
on the mineral water market.

180
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:07,592
So he's the boss and has the right to fire me!

181
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:10,800
But my dad left me penniless.

182
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:13,342
I'm fed up, uncle.

183
00:15:13,508 --> 00:15:16,342
Shakti, wait. This is the end of the world?

184
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:17,800
You can always find another job.

185
00:15:18,258 --> 00:15:19,883
Oh, I'm the owner of the red diploma.

186
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,383
And I offer work in Canada
on a golden platter.

187
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,133
At least I could be badnitom!

188
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:26,883
But my mother raised me
worthy man and died.

189
00:15:27,383 --> 00:15:28,967
Money is an evil necessity, uncle.

190
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:31,717
When I asked our local moneylender
to lend me the money...

191
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,383
... He called me a loser and an orphan.

192
00:15:33,675 --> 00:15:35,175
How can he say that you're
a loser or destitute?

193
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:36,925
Do you also have money.

194
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,633
I and so bad now.
I have not been to your jokes.

195
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:41,675
You do not believe. Wait a minute.

196
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,383
Read it.

197
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:58,758
My dad owned five acres of land
in Aruvankudu. Five acres!

198
00:15:58,842 --> 00:16:01,883
If I'm selling this land, I will be
able to buy a truck for your money.

199
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:05,050
I showed it to you not for you
to be able to sell the land.

200
00:16:05,425 --> 00:16:07,175
I do not want you to feel poor.

201
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:11,717
Day and night on the bike, my
knees are worn out already.

202
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:13,300
I can not do more.

203
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:15,008
I'll buy the truck with the money my father.

204
00:16:15,092 --> 00:16:16,133
Why can not I do that?

205
00:16:16,425 --> 00:16:18,925
There have been a family feud,
which has not been solved.

206
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,800
If you go there, your
life will be in danger.

207
00:16:21,883 --> 00:16:23,717
That's why your mother has not sold the land...

208
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,008
... And worked as a maid all the time.

209
00:16:25,092 --> 00:16:26,008
All in the past, the uncle.

210
00:16:26,217 --> 00:16:27,258
Life flies so fast...

211
00:16:27,342 --> 00:16:29,675
... People forget even turn off
the light in the bathroom.

212
00:16:29,883 --> 00:16:33,425
As if they remember the hatred
that was twenty-seven years ago.

213
00:16:33,508 --> 00:16:34,800
In addition, look at my face.

214
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:38,050
Who would want to hurt
this child's face?

215
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:39,633
Uncle, what are you talking about?

216
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:43,008
- I'll go and take a look at the ground.
- Listen to me.

217
00:16:43,258 --> 00:16:44,342
Do not go to this village.

218
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:46,008
My sister asked me to take care of you.

219
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,883
- Give me the document, Shakti.
- I can handle this, Uncle.

220
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,550
Listen to me, Shakti.

221
00:16:53,842 --> 00:16:56,342
They are on their way to
meet with us, Father.

222
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:06,467
Kali, our family tradition
to take care of our guests.

223
00:17:06,633 --> 00:17:10,592
They have to remember all
of our hospitality zhiz.

224
00:17:23,758 --> 00:17:26,717
The whole area looks like this?

225
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,925
Yes, there is only fallow land.

226
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:31,217
Have we in Andhra Pradesh
land is not better?

227
00:17:32,133 --> 00:17:36,300
Mr. Reddy, you are
very perceptive man!

228
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:39,342
In your state fertile land?

229
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:42,633
Is that why you want to do business here?

230
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:47,425
These are different things.
Help us make a deal.

231
00:17:47,508 --> 00:17:49,300
Do not worry, Mr. Reddy.

232
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:52,342
The village is full of bullies.

233
00:17:55,633 --> 00:18:00,508
Mr. Reddy, I explain to Mr. Riyaru.

234
00:18:00,592 --> 00:18:02,925
And complete for you this deal.

235
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:08,800
You'll make millions.
Give me at least ten percent?

236
00:18:08,883 --> 00:18:11,258
What do you think, boss?

237
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:15,842
Sir, is not so easy to convince Mr. Riyara.

238
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,592
You must know something.

239
00:18:18,092 --> 00:18:19,967
Before coming here, I spoke
to the local police.

240
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,300
Against Mr. Riyara and his two sons, filed
dozens of statements to the police.

241
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:26,550
But all in vain,
because no one shows.

242
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,217
Not only this village.

243
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:30,217
The entire area is under his control.

244
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:32,467
He rules with an iron fist here.

245
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,467
We take care of it, boss.

246
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,342
They are here.

247
00:18:56,592 --> 00:18:57,842
Come.

248
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,550
Hello.

249
00:19:12,592 --> 00:19:14,175
You arrived without incident?

250
00:19:14,258 --> 00:19:14,967
Yes, all right.

251
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,758
- This is my eldest son, Dharma. - Hi.

252
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,717
- Junior Kali. - Hi.

253
00:19:18,883 --> 00:19:20,217
Give him water to wash his feet.

254
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,258
- Let's go. - Yes.

255
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,217
You scared us with his stories.

256
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,425
You hit the target.

257
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:31,842
Just shut your big mouth.

258
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:33,883
I have to close it?

259
00:19:41,092 --> 00:19:45,258
Keep your umbrella right
here is a little hot.

260
00:19:48,633 --> 00:19:49,883
Wait.

261
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:51,550
- Who's there? - Yes, sir.

262
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:53,217
Why is not removed immediately?

263
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,175
Get cow dung away.

264
00:19:55,217 --> 00:19:59,008
It seems that he is not against us fall at the feet!

265
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:00,592
Let's go.

266
00:20:01,592 --> 00:20:02,633
Do you have anything to say?

267
00:20:02,883 --> 00:20:04,508
No, nothing.

268
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:08,758
I have been told that you are the real criminals.

269
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,758
You are more like collectors rice.

270
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,258
Why do you have in the house of a cow on a leash?

271
00:20:20,425 --> 00:20:21,800
This is our family tradition.

272
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,675
- It's amazing.
- Please, have a seat.

273
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:27,550
According to our family tradition,
we honor God as the cow.

274
00:20:27,925 --> 00:20:31,758
It's part of our family.

275
00:20:34,425 --> 00:20:36,175
This is not entirely true.

276
00:20:36,842 --> 00:20:39,467
You dressed as a cow there.

277
00:20:50,592 --> 00:20:57,008
Okay, let's move on to the
purpose of our visit. I'm right?

278
00:20:58,592 --> 00:21:02,592
Sir, if you are familiar with these
documents, we can discuss...

279
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:04,300
We can do it then...

280
00:21:05,425 --> 00:21:08,467
He says there is no need,
it is completely ignorant.

281
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,592
Why make it?

282
00:21:10,258 --> 00:21:16,508
This is a formidable and respected family.

283
00:21:18,425 --> 00:21:21,800
We have been told that you have
your own kingdom with henchmen.

284
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:25,050
Maybe we can give an additional
five percent for it.

285
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:28,508
If you agree with our demands...

286
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,758
... You will make us very happy.
If you refuse...

287
00:21:30,967 --> 00:21:33,550
.. .we Will plan our next move.

288
00:21:35,008 --> 00:21:36,300
Am I right?

289
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:37,842
We can talk business later.

290
00:21:38,342 --> 00:21:39,675
- Let's have lunch. - Of course.

291
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:40,925
- Food, yes? - Please, come in.

292
00:21:49,425 --> 00:21:50,883
Very tasty.

293
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:54,883
Enough.

294
00:21:58,467 --> 00:21:59,592
Enough. Thank you, mother.

295
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:00,842
You do not eat?

296
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:02,383
First guests. I'll eat later.

297
00:22:02,592 --> 00:22:04,175
So eat leftovers?

298
00:22:04,383 --> 00:22:06,217
All so strong, and eat the remains ?!

299
00:22:13,467 --> 00:22:16,133
Madame, is the brains?

300
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:19,217
Give your husband. He needs it!

301
00:22:26,467 --> 00:22:27,758
Brains. Brain.

302
00:22:28,508 --> 00:22:30,008
You said I could not.

303
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,842
You have seen how I made a deal?

304
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:33,633
Like clockwork!

305
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:38,592
- Betel leaves? - No.

306
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:41,842
The Boss, shall we go?

307
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:46,633
I do not think that you will agree so quickly.

308
00:22:46,717 --> 00:22:49,258
Only in a place like this,
we can create a factory.

309
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,425
You are going to marry or be...

310
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:55,883
... All the time to serve your father ?!

311
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,842
Are you wondering why we
were welcoming hosts home...

312
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:41,425
... And it is so cruel?

313
00:23:42,925 --> 00:23:46,092
I had to kill him on the
spot for his filthy language

314
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:50,008
But our house for us, as a temple.

315
00:23:50,592 --> 00:23:54,425
Our tradition has not shed
a drop of blood inside.

316
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:58,633
Even if he is my enemy in
my house he was a guest.

317
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:04,633
But at the moment he
stepped out of our house!

318
00:24:07,217 --> 00:24:08,342
Give me a sickle.

319
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:12,258
Kali, do not you see we're talking?

320
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:13,717
Get him out of here.

321
00:24:15,092 --> 00:24:16,508
Come?

322
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,425
Hey, hey!

323
00:24:21,258 --> 00:24:24,967
You will not find a good meal
until you reach Chennai.

324
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,800
I asked to pack food in containers.

325
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:30,050
- Alag, you put fish sauce? - Yes, sir.

326
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,383
I packed it.

327
00:24:32,008 --> 00:24:36,133
I noticed how you
savor our fish sauce.

328
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:38,550
Let's go.

329
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:41,258
- All packed? - Yes.

330
00:24:44,467 --> 00:24:45,675
Please sit down.

331
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:49,633
Quick Start Your Engines!

332
00:24:49,967 --> 00:24:54,050
I'm not happy commissions,
which you suggested.

333
00:24:55,592 --> 00:24:58,508
But I agreed to our people in
the village could benefit.

334
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:00,800
Do not ever forget it.

335
00:25:02,758 --> 00:25:04,217
Clever.

336
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,342
"I'm going to flirt, if you put
me next to a lady's bike."

337
00:25:14,842 --> 00:25:15,633
How?

338
00:25:16,425 --> 00:25:17,633
Fifty per day.

339
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:20,092
Fifty?

340
00:25:20,425 --> 00:25:21,592
On the whole night?

341
00:25:21,883 --> 00:25:24,092
No, at night I'll
put it in his bed.

342
00:25:24,383 --> 00:25:26,050
Fifty rupees a day.

343
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,008
Valet earns more than PhD.

344
00:25:30,217 --> 00:25:32,258
I do not even get eighty rupees
if offered it for scrap.

345
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,508
Why pay a hundred and fifty rupees for three days?

346
00:25:34,592 --> 00:25:37,217
"You are gloomy because of the one hundred and fifty rupees."

347
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,508
Sir, come back when you want.

348
00:25:38,592 --> 00:25:39,592
We are open until late at night.

349
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
- Sir. - What can I do for you?

350
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:54,258
I want something to donate.

351
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:55,008
What do you want to give?

352
00:25:55,092 --> 00:25:57,925
"What it has to offer, when it
can not even pay for parking?"

353
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,008
This bicycle.

354
00:25:59,092 --> 00:26:00,258
"Oh my God!"

355
00:26:00,342 --> 00:26:03,592
I have owned it for 10-15 years,
it hurts rasstavatsya with him.

356
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:06,008
But still, someone can
use it, is not it?

357
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,342
- Look, let down the bike into the van.
- Yes sir.

358
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,217
"I carried you through the streets, man.
You abandoned me ungrateful."

359
00:26:13,258 --> 00:26:18,092
"I swear by the tires, you're
still going to look for me."

360
00:26:18,175 --> 00:26:20,550
"I swear ladies' bicycle,
which to me as a sister."

361
00:26:20,633 --> 00:26:23,842
"How he entered rude with me."

362
00:26:37,092 --> 00:26:38,383
- Hey! Hey! Hey! - Scum!

363
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,175
Baby in blue, ride?

364
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:45,425
Wow, dude.

365
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:49,008
What is the song, dude.

366
00:26:49,217 --> 00:26:50,883
Sir, I'm sorry.

367
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:52,175
What?

368
00:26:52,258 --> 00:26:54,008
This is my place.

369
00:26:54,675 --> 00:26:55,592
Exactly?

370
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,383
I can take your place?

371
00:26:57,758 --> 00:26:59,675
Dude, get up.

372
00:27:00,592 --> 00:27:01,550
You said it was your place.

373
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:02,592
I have not found any signs here.

374
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:07,217
You have a decent view.

375
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,050
Why are you acting?

376
00:27:08,133 --> 00:27:10,633
- You laugh at me?
- You're so fast it is understood?

377
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,050
- Hey! - I hit his head? Come here.

378
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:17,967
Why did you hit me with a shoe?

379
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,342
I want to see a sign with
your name on your hip.

380
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,050
Do not. For me there is no panties!

381
00:27:22,092 --> 00:27:25,967
How can you travel without panties!
Are you ran with the soul?

382
00:27:30,008 --> 00:27:31,675
We have to teach him a lesson.

383
00:27:31,758 --> 00:27:34,175
Dude, Raj is already at the station.

384
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,592
You laugh at us.

385
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:40,217
Our friend Raj is coming soon.

386
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,425
And once you stop smiling!

387
00:27:42,633 --> 00:27:45,842
Am I a clown to smile all the time ?!

388
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,550
Who is Raj?

389
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:50,300
It is the coolest.

390
00:27:54,467 --> 00:27:56,758
It will make a mockery out of you.

391
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:02,258
It does not just beat you.

392
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:04,633
It is to make fun of you mentally.

393
00:28:04,717 --> 00:28:05,467
Yes!

394
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,300
Look, here it is.

395
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:17,758
Looks like a rickshaw driver.

396
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:19,842
He alone?

397
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,467
- Hi friends. - Hi Raj.

398
00:28:24,550 --> 00:28:26,925
- Well, how are you? - Not good, dude.

399
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:27,717
Why?

400
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,842
It hurt us, dude.

401
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:36,425
.. He hurt you ..?

402
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:40,758
You may be able to withstand the impact.

403
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:44,258
But if you can withstand
my humiliation?

404
00:28:44,508 --> 00:28:45,467
Today is your turn.

405
00:28:47,842 --> 00:28:48,425
Stop!

406
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:51,342
If I start now, he
jumped off the train.

407
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,633
Let the train will begin to move.

408
00:28:52,925 --> 00:28:55,842
We will make an ass out of it
for ten hours without a break.

409
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,300
I guarantee you full razvlekuhu.

410
00:29:01,092 --> 00:29:02,467
Come on, dude.

411
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,550
Come on, dude

412
00:29:05,633 --> 00:29:07,175
.. My hand hurts.

413
00:29:23,175 --> 00:29:24,342
Oh no!

414
00:30:22,258 --> 00:30:23,717
I'll stop the train!

415
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:30,592
Oh, no.

416
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,383
I'm sorry.

417
00:30:35,883 --> 00:30:36,842
I hope you did not hurt.

418
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:37,800
No, I...

419
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:38,675
He just hit.

420
00:30:38,758 --> 00:30:40,842
But he is a hero, right? It is not recognized.

421
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:42,175
That's right, the hero?

422
00:30:44,967 --> 00:30:48,467
Raj handsome, handsome.

423
00:30:48,675 --> 00:30:50,050
See our hero.

424
00:30:50,133 --> 00:30:52,592
Hero rolled, rolled hero.

425
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,175
Ask him to stop laughing,
he looks terrible.

426
00:31:05,258 --> 00:31:07,508
He laughs to make you feel bad.

427
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:11,300
But when he laughs, his
face really looks awful!

428
00:31:11,383 --> 00:31:12,217
No.

429
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:15,550
Let's not say Raja.
He is upset.

430
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:16,508
You promise?

431
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:18,258
Mom swear.

432
00:31:22,008 --> 00:31:23,217
Look at the hero.

433
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:26,925
Why are you risking ass, trying
to help her get into the train?

434
00:31:27,133 --> 00:31:29,633
Not thought to pull the emergency brake?

435
00:31:30,008 --> 00:31:33,217
I know that the emergency brake stops the train.

436
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,675
But the controller also
will stop and ask you...

437
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:39,175
Pay a fine of Rs 2500.

438
00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:53,633
- Samos, samosa.
- Please move the legs a little bit.

439
00:31:53,717 --> 00:31:54,508
The lady passes.

440
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,967
- Samos, samosa. - Lady, lady.

441
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:57,800
- Samos, samosa. - Lady, lady.

442
00:31:57,883 --> 00:31:59,633
- Samos, samosa. - Lady, lady.

443
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,300
- Samos, samosa. - Lady, lady.

444
00:32:01,383 --> 00:32:03,092
- Samos, samosa. - Lady, lady.

445
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:04,467
- Samos, samosa. - Sir, let me Dame!

446
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:06,467
- What boy? - Which I'm a boy!

447
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:09,175
Why do you say "lady",
under the theme "samosa"?

448
00:32:09,342 --> 00:32:11,092
What if passengers are lured?

449
00:32:11,175 --> 00:32:12,300
I say this for your own good. Go.

450
00:32:12,383 --> 00:32:13,550
- Lady, lady. - Come on.

451
00:32:13,633 --> 00:32:15,258
Sir, samosa!

452
00:32:15,467 --> 00:32:16,883
It is made in Germany?

453
00:32:17,092 --> 00:32:19,050
As if I have not seen a real samosa.

454
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,008
One minute.

455
00:32:22,092 --> 00:32:24,592
Do you want to pick up a pie from the floor?

456
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:26,633
Buy samosa his wife, did not
pick them up from the floor.

457
00:32:27,383 --> 00:32:30,425
He decided to pin samosa seller.

458
00:32:30,508 --> 00:32:31,508
Chill out, man.

459
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:33,967
I played on the seller Zapote!

460
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:36,300
Zapote seasonal fruit. You will not get it.

461
00:32:36,883 --> 00:32:39,633
Tell me, tell me something.

462
00:33:18,425 --> 00:33:20,675
"It paints a portrait of me?"

463
00:33:22,842 --> 00:33:25,008
"I'm sweating because fled."

464
00:33:25,092 --> 00:33:26,800
"Maybe that's why my face is lit?"

465
00:34:28,008 --> 00:34:29,800
Look at this, man.

466
00:34:31,967 --> 00:34:33,967
Hero, hero.

467
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:38,842
As he posed!

468
00:34:38,925 --> 00:34:43,217
Hey dude! Write a song on this topic!
Please, I want a song.

469
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:49,092
"Monkey, monkey, clown of the train."

470
00:34:49,175 --> 00:34:52,592
"Monkey, monkey, clown of the train."

471
00:34:52,675 --> 00:34:54,217
See.

472
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,550
Look at our hero.

473
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,717
See!

474
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:59,883
Watch carefully.

475
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:02,550
"Monkey, monkey, clown of the train."

476
00:35:02,633 --> 00:35:03,800
Madam, super.

477
00:35:03,883 --> 00:35:05,300
What is the exact copy!

478
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:07,925
Picasso nervously smokes on the sidelines!

479
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,383
Good.

480
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,175
Sorry. I do not...

481
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:13,925
Do I have asked me to draw?

482
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:15,633
Why do I have disgraced in front of everyone?

483
00:35:15,717 --> 00:35:18,092
I do not draw you. Look over there.

484
00:35:23,383 --> 00:35:24,925
We lost this round.

485
00:35:25,008 --> 00:35:27,758
- You drew this monkey? - Yes.

486
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:30,008
They've got a pin up.

487
00:35:30,217 --> 00:35:32,383
This white monkey.

488
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,925
This black monkey that
escaped from the jungle.

489
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,925
I do not know what breed this monkey!

490
00:35:37,008 --> 00:35:38,925
- Why are you laughing. - I did not want.

491
00:35:39,008 --> 00:35:41,508
How can I do to offend the
monkey with the word "monkey" ?!

492
00:35:41,592 --> 00:35:43,758
You know how they used to bully me ?!

493
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,592
I'm sorry.

494
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,008
Are you still mad at me?

495
00:35:46,092 --> 00:35:47,467
- No - I Vanati.

496
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:50,008
I Shakti.

497
00:35:50,175 --> 00:35:51,258
By the way, I...

498
00:35:51,342 --> 00:35:52,342
Throw this garbage.

499
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:53,758
- Sit down. - Again he insulted.

500
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:56,508
If you have disgraced again
be a hat-trick, Raj.

501
00:35:56,967 --> 00:35:59,133
- Do not pity him. - Yes, Raj.

502
00:36:01,675 --> 00:36:02,425
You Aruvankadu from?

503
00:36:02,508 --> 00:36:04,008
Yes, why are you going there?

504
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:06,092
I have to sell the land,
which I know there is.

505
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:07,217
Oh!

506
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:08,883
Coconut milk!

507
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:09,967
You'll coconut milk?

508
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:10,758
Yes.

509
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:12,675
- Give me one. - Good.

510
00:36:12,883 --> 00:36:13,800
Do you want a cool drink?

511
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:17,258
Now I know how you earned
the pregnant belly!

512
00:36:17,342 --> 00:36:19,800
Do you want to and we have become such?
Get out of here.

513
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:22,092
Vremelёt!

514
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:23,800
- What? Time flies? - Yes.

515
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:26,092
When I'm with you, time flies.

516
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:28,717
So now I'm going
to call Vremelёt.

517
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,133
- Hey! - What is it, sir?

518
00:36:34,383 --> 00:36:35,133
Do not put straw.

519
00:36:35,217 --> 00:36:35,925
Why?

520
00:36:36,008 --> 00:36:38,925
Some assholes they are collected
from the trash, wash and give again.

521
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:41,050
This exactly.

522
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:43,508
Thinking that they drink in style...

523
00:36:43,592 --> 00:36:45,217
Morons... Many eventually find
themselves with ulcers in the mouth!

524
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:48,008
Bring it here.

525
00:36:51,258 --> 00:36:53,133
The train moved. Pay me quickly.

526
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:54,592
- How much? - Forty rupees.

527
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,883
- Forty rupees? - Yes.

528
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,300
What is the inflated price!

529
00:36:57,383 --> 00:36:59,050
- Sir, please give me the money.
- Run for your money.

530
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,175
Only then you will be ashamed. Here. Go.

531
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:04,383
Some people just brought me!

532
00:37:04,633 --> 00:37:07,217
Well in a way to drink coconut milk.

533
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:19,133
I usually choose small coconuts!

534
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:21,050
This seems to be very large.

535
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:22,092
I'll get it.

536
00:37:22,175 --> 00:37:26,175
Hey! Look at the wiseacre
who abandoned straw!

537
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,925
Why pull it in the middle?

538
00:37:43,008 --> 00:37:44,508
Put it on a couple of inches and pull out.

539
00:37:44,592 --> 00:37:46,050
You take care better about yourself!

540
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,467
Tell a story?

541
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:54,092
- Yes, Raj. - Four of the surgeon doing...

542
00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:57,967
... Hospital patient brain surgery.

543
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,758
- So what? - Suddenly no electricity.

544
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:03,175
When the lights, leaving only the brain.

545
00:38:03,258 --> 00:38:04,300
The patient had disappeared!

546
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,175
Who is this man without a brain, dude?

547
00:38:06,258 --> 00:38:08,258
It is in front of us.

548
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:12,300
What is a low blow, dude!

549
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,592
Here.

550
00:38:25,675 --> 00:38:26,800
How to ..?

551
00:38:27,008 --> 00:38:30,133
Did not I say that get him?

552
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,675
Drink.

553
00:38:37,467 --> 00:38:38,842
Jokers, huh?

554
00:38:39,425 --> 00:38:41,342
- I'm sorry. - He's coming here, Raj.

555
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:47,383
Hey guys! What's happening?

556
00:38:47,467 --> 00:38:50,133
How Petrosyans on stage...

557
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:52,383
... You joke grass here.

558
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:55,133
Why are you laughing at me?

559
00:38:55,342 --> 00:38:57,300
The victim was found?

560
00:38:58,758 --> 00:39:00,258
Hey, filthy mouth!

561
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:02,342
Do you think you are the king of sarcasm ?!

562
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:05,508
He thinks he can stab
me with their barbs!

563
00:39:05,592 --> 00:39:08,425
You have seen only one
on my face, I have both!

564
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:10,467
And some of them do not
look like your ass?

565
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,175
- Tell me, tell me something. - Shut up.

566
00:39:12,258 --> 00:39:13,258
We're local guys.

567
00:39:13,467 --> 00:39:17,467
On your face the color of mashed potatoes, you local?

568
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,258
Leave him.

569
00:39:18,342 --> 00:39:19,467
What did you say?

570
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,300
He's a guy, do not insult him.

571
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:23,175
It's yours tebenok, or what?

572
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:28,050
Put it on all fours, sit on it and
it will be like an old turtle.

573
00:39:28,425 --> 00:39:29,592
Do you think, who are you?

574
00:39:29,675 --> 00:39:30,300
Tell me.

575
00:39:30,383 --> 00:39:32,592
- Do you think, who are you? - Tell me.

576
00:39:32,675 --> 00:39:33,550
Do not hurry.

577
00:39:33,592 --> 00:39:36,800
- Tell him that he tucked his shirt.
- What shirt?

578
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:39,175
You seem began to play.

579
00:39:39,508 --> 00:39:41,592
Sit rest. Sit down.

580
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:42,550
No, get up on your feet.

581
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:44,675
You're terrible, when you sit.

582
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:48,217
Use your gray cells and
think up something better.

583
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,717
Thank you for giving us the time.

584
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,383
Jerk! He's laughing at us.

585
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:53,258
You do not even know who I am.

586
00:39:53,342 --> 00:39:54,467
You insult me!

587
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:57,758
Vremelёt.

588
00:39:57,842 --> 00:40:00,508
He calls himself a leader,
and has two followers.

589
00:40:00,592 --> 00:40:01,383
Just leave them.

590
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:05,383
If they leave, they will not be afraid.

591
00:40:05,467 --> 00:40:08,425
Now, even if I call you, do
not look in my direction.

592
00:40:08,508 --> 00:40:09,592
Raj?

593
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:11,383
- Raj, he is calling you. - You sit down.

594
00:40:11,467 --> 00:40:14,008
Umnikov of themselves build.

595
00:40:14,175 --> 00:40:15,717
Well call him.

596
00:40:15,925 --> 00:40:16,800
Raj!

597
00:40:17,633 --> 00:40:19,133
He did not look in that direction.

598
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:26,008
She called me, and I could not
answer, all because of him!

599
00:40:26,092 --> 00:40:29,133
Raj deep thinking, dude.

600
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:32,550
This cries uncle.

601
00:40:36,508 --> 00:40:40,175
He forced Raja to suffer.
I feel like he was crying.

602
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,883
Call him.

603
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:47,092
Then he will understand who we are.

604
00:40:57,258 --> 00:40:58,133
Talk.

605
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,633
The guy on the train insulted us.

606
00:41:00,717 --> 00:41:02,092
Raj did not you?

607
00:41:03,467 --> 00:41:05,508
Raj also was offended!

608
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,675
What's he doing now?

609
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:10,425
Under the guise of tying shoelaces...

610
00:41:10,508 --> 00:41:11,508
... He bent down and cries.

611
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,842
Photo!

612
00:41:12,925 --> 00:41:13,633
Whose, sir?

613
00:41:13,675 --> 00:41:15,633
His photos!

614
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:17,883
Well, for one minute. Stay on the line.

615
00:41:29,925 --> 00:41:31,717
No!

616
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:37,508
In January last year, it was me!
This summer, it's your turn, huh ?!

617
00:41:37,675 --> 00:41:38,633
My condolences!

618
00:41:55,758 --> 00:41:57,550
Why he stopped near the woods?

619
00:41:57,633 --> 00:41:59,175
Do machinist diarrhea?

620
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,592
You try to grease?

621
00:42:01,675 --> 00:42:02,675
Otvyan.

622
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,675
- Madame. - Alag? How did you come here?

623
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:08,008
I stopped the train.

624
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:10,050
Your father wanted me to bring you dinner.

625
00:42:10,258 --> 00:42:13,883
Who is he? His mustache simply enchanting!

626
00:42:14,092 --> 00:42:16,008
Our chef, his name Alag (beautiful).

627
00:42:16,092 --> 00:42:17,092
It can be your cook.

628
00:42:17,175 --> 00:42:18,675
But it does not justify its name!

629
00:42:20,258 --> 00:42:21,467
Do you think that all I do is eat?

630
00:42:21,550 --> 00:42:23,592
I forgot to bring the curry.

631
00:42:23,675 --> 00:42:25,092
Sendhil is in a nearby village.

632
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,300
Tell him to stop the
train and brought?

633
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:27,342
What did you say?

634
00:42:27,675 --> 00:42:29,175
I heard the train
stop when on strike.

635
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,050
Now they stop for a curry.

636
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:32,800
It just teasing you!

637
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:36,842
Yes, Dad.

638
00:42:37,092 --> 00:42:38,925
You met Alag?

639
00:42:39,008 --> 00:42:41,175
He brought so much food!

640
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:44,092
Total enough, dear?

641
00:42:44,508 --> 00:42:46,133
Send somebody else
at the next station?

642
00:42:46,383 --> 00:42:47,675
Dad!

643
00:42:48,008 --> 00:42:50,425
Good dinner. Good night.

644
00:42:50,758 --> 00:42:51,342
Good.

645
00:42:51,425 --> 00:42:52,675
Do not spoil your health...

646
00:42:52,758 --> 00:42:54,633
... All the time drawing and rest.

647
00:42:56,883 --> 00:42:59,300
Do you hear me, darling?

648
00:43:00,092 --> 00:43:01,425
Yes, Dad.

649
00:43:01,842 --> 00:43:04,050
Good. Take care of yourself.

650
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:05,717
Okay, Dad.

651
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:07,342
I hang up the phone.

652
00:43:10,425 --> 00:43:13,592
I will come back to clean after dinner.

653
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:14,633
Good.

654
00:43:15,925 --> 00:43:18,842
I hope no one thinks
I'm a fruit vendor.

655
00:43:19,008 --> 00:43:20,050
Have dinner?

656
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:21,300
Course. Good.

657
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:35,258
My battery is discharged.
Call five minutes.

658
00:43:35,967 --> 00:43:36,592
Sorry.

659
00:43:36,675 --> 00:43:38,967
You have a charger?

660
00:43:39,133 --> 00:43:42,967
Pulled out her boyfriend chatting all night?

661
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:44,508
Let her sleep.

662
00:43:44,592 --> 00:43:45,675
It should be in the morning to go to work.

663
00:43:45,758 --> 00:43:47,217
Hey, enough!

664
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:49,508
Unfortunately, I do
not have a charger.

665
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:50,758
It's okay. No problems.

666
00:43:50,842 --> 00:43:52,092
Why you were rude to her?

667
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:54,925
Is it not true that I said to her?

668
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,508
Guys fall in love and get married.

669
00:43:57,592 --> 00:44:00,508
But girls like just as long as they are married.

670
00:44:00,675 --> 00:44:04,300
Impermanence - the name of your woman.

671
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:06,092
Do not stigmatize all girls.

672
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,175
Often parents are the villains.

673
00:44:08,258 --> 00:44:11,758
Girls fall in love, knowing that
their parents are the villains!

674
00:44:12,217 --> 00:44:13,508
Vremelёt! This is not true.

675
00:44:13,592 --> 00:44:17,675
Preferences girls are always changing.

676
00:44:17,967 --> 00:44:21,092
They change their minds all the time!

677
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,508
After the guys zaimeyut
your opinion...

678
00:44:22,592 --> 00:44:23,800
... They will stick to it all the time.

679
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:24,925
What are you talking about?

680
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:27,717
Prove?

681
00:44:29,217 --> 00:44:32,883
Hello, Lady in Red.
Who do you like in school?

682
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:34,675
Kamal Haasan.

683
00:44:34,842 --> 00:44:36,217
In college?

684
00:44:36,633 --> 00:44:37,258
Madhavan.

685
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,008
Now?

686
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:39,008
Simba.

687
00:44:40,258 --> 00:44:42,258
- Brother, you. - Speak.

688
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,675
Who do you like in school?

689
00:44:43,758 --> 00:44:44,633
Super Star Rajini.

690
00:44:44,717 --> 00:44:45,633
In college?

691
00:44:45,717 --> 00:44:46,425
Naturally, Rajini.

692
00:44:46,508 --> 00:44:47,050
Now?

693
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:49,592
Now, and always, I'm a
fan of superstar Rajini.

694
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,717
- Well said, brother.
- Did not I tell you?

695
00:44:54,008 --> 00:44:57,008
Boys hold their opinions
on lifelong learning.

696
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,633
- You are tired, my dear?
- If your husband sees this...

697
00:45:03,675 --> 00:45:05,633
... He dies of a heart attack!

698
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,883
You have an old man asleep on his lap!

699
00:45:06,967 --> 00:45:08,175
- Get up! - What?

700
00:45:08,342 --> 00:45:09,508
She's my wife.

701
00:45:09,675 --> 00:45:11,342
- Is that you? - Yes, my boy.

702
00:45:11,425 --> 00:45:13,425
Your bald head like a pot
upside down on his knees.

703
00:45:13,508 --> 00:45:14,550
Cover it.

704
00:45:14,758 --> 00:45:16,633
You're embarrassing me, dear.
What are you saying?

705
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:19,133
I hate to think that
I'm on your honeymoon.

706
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:20,133
Why should I not lie in
the lap of his wife?

707
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,133
See how he wore a wig.

708
00:45:22,217 --> 00:45:23,300
See how he lies on his bald head.

709
00:45:23,592 --> 00:45:25,925
You do look like a voodoo doll!

710
00:45:26,175 --> 00:45:27,717
I want to sleep.

711
00:45:29,342 --> 00:45:32,175
Now his wig looks
like a dead crow!

712
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:35,592
Do not know whether to laugh or cry.

713
00:45:52,925 --> 00:45:55,300
Why are you sad?

714
00:45:55,467 --> 00:45:57,425
I love to travel.

715
00:45:57,633 --> 00:46:03,675
Magic moon night in the train,
it's so cute, is not it?

716
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:07,092
But I'm sad that we are at
the end of this journey.

717
00:46:07,175 --> 00:46:09,800
What do you think about this?

718
00:46:09,883 --> 00:46:12,008
In all my time.

719
00:46:12,092 --> 00:46:15,383
Just time flies quickly.

720
00:46:15,550 --> 00:46:17,675
When we are happy...

721
00:46:17,758 --> 00:46:20,425
... No need to wonder,
when this is over.

722
00:46:20,508 --> 00:46:23,883
Seize the moment! Live one day.

723
00:46:24,258 --> 00:46:28,217
Remember that. Life should
be lived to the full.

724
00:50:44,592 --> 00:50:45,800
Vremelёt!

725
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:47,258
The train stops here
only for a moment.

726
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,133
Hey, wait!

727
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:02,925
Hello.

728
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,467
Uncle, how are you?

729
00:51:06,508 --> 00:51:08,175
- OK, and you? - On top of the world!

730
00:51:08,342 --> 00:51:08,967
Dad?

731
00:51:09,342 --> 00:51:10,467
Dad?

732
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:11,675
Your luggage?

733
00:51:14,508 --> 00:51:15,467
How are you, dear?

734
00:51:15,883 --> 00:51:16,758
I'm fine.

735
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:17,633
Brother.

736
00:51:17,842 --> 00:51:19,092
Why did you become thin as a rake?

737
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:20,633
The food was bad in the hostel?

738
00:51:20,717 --> 00:51:22,217
Leave about food.

739
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:24,217
Ask her how much she had
left tails on their studies?

740
00:51:24,508 --> 00:51:26,217
Uncle, I'll strangle you.

741
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:28,175
Started their squabbles, huh?

742
00:51:29,342 --> 00:51:30,592
Let's go.

743
00:51:38,675 --> 00:51:40,550
Forgotten something on the train?

744
00:51:42,092 --> 00:51:43,008
Let's go.

745
00:51:53,383 --> 00:51:57,717
Vanati! Vanati!

746
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:03,675
You'll go home with his uncle.

747
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:04,967
We will go to the temple, and then go home.

748
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:06,092
Okay, Dad.

749
00:52:06,717 --> 00:52:07,467
Go.

750
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:09,633
Why are you smiling to herself?

751
00:52:09,717 --> 00:52:12,717
I met on the train of interesting types.

752
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,925
Entertaining hundred percent.

753
00:52:14,633 --> 00:52:17,342
Oh! That's why you always
look back on the train...

754
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,633
... Not wanting to go home ?!

755
00:52:19,425 --> 00:52:20,383
Fall in love, huh?

756
00:52:20,467 --> 00:52:21,883
Nothing like that.

757
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:23,758
It's just a friend. It's all.

758
00:52:23,925 --> 00:52:27,217
Do you still draw all the time?

759
00:52:28,008 --> 00:52:29,133
Or you leave this habit?

760
00:52:29,217 --> 00:52:30,550
Do not leave.

761
00:52:31,008 --> 00:52:31,800
What are you drawing?

762
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:36,133
I draw is that in my heart.

763
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,550
Oh! Hopefully your pictures are not crazy?

764
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:42,550
Let me see them!

765
00:52:47,175 --> 00:52:48,217
Where is it?

766
00:52:48,508 --> 00:52:49,425
What happened?

767
00:52:49,633 --> 00:52:51,008
My album disappeared.

768
00:52:52,758 --> 00:52:54,008
Lost?

769
00:52:54,883 --> 00:52:55,800
Super!

770
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:57,842
Thank God!

771
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:01,967
And then I'd have to admire
the images of your heart.

772
00:53:23,758 --> 00:53:26,217
Passengers following in
Aruvankadu, please get off.

773
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,383
O God! My head!

774
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:38,508
Enough thump in the night!

775
00:53:38,592 --> 00:53:40,550
That price khalyavnykh booze.

776
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,758
I think all over the world,
the main theme - a hangover.

777
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:47,633
A good man, how do I get
to the street Kotapalayam?

778
00:53:47,717 --> 00:53:49,550
Street Kotapalayam?

779
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:51,633
It seeks dilapidated pavilion.

780
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:56,675
If you go straight
son, reach school.

781
00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:00,008
- There is no road for a long time. - Correctly.

782
00:54:00,092 --> 00:54:02,675
There is a short path through the woods.

783
00:54:02,758 --> 00:54:03,925
It is new in town.

784
00:54:04,008 --> 00:54:04,758
How could he know the shortest way?

785
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:06,967
Go straight across the field.

786
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,967
You get to the pump unit.

787
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:10,508
You ask from drunks address.

788
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:12,633
- Who do you call a drunkard?
- I said, wino.

789
00:54:15,217 --> 00:54:16,675
I thought you show me the way.

790
00:54:16,758 --> 00:54:18,133
But you're barking at
each other like dogs!

791
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,092
- I will not spare you.
- Easy, easy.

792
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:21,592
Hey, shut up.

793
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,633
Now you get!

794
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:25,467
What is that noise?

795
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:28,092
He wanted to know the way to
the dilapidated pavilion.

796
00:54:28,758 --> 00:54:29,592
- Is that so? - Yes.

797
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:30,883
I'm going in the wrong direction. I can take.

798
00:54:32,383 --> 00:54:33,258
Thank you.

799
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:49,633
I will not be silent.

800
00:54:50,675 --> 00:54:52,383
- Enough already. - All have forgotten.

801
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:59,717
What a gorgeous bike?

802
00:55:00,383 --> 00:55:03,133
And the outfit you anything...

803
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,508
... This bike is a match for you.

804
00:55:12,883 --> 00:55:13,842
There dug up the road?

805
00:55:14,342 --> 00:55:15,300
Next foot.

806
00:55:15,842 --> 00:55:16,592
Hey! Maruda!

807
00:55:16,883 --> 00:55:17,508
Sir?

808
00:55:18,258 --> 00:55:19,925
Take him in the dilapidated pavilion.

809
00:55:20,008 --> 00:55:20,883
Yes, sir.

810
00:55:22,258 --> 00:55:23,925
- Thank you very much. - It's my pleasure.

811
00:55:24,883 --> 00:55:26,050
Watch your feet.

812
00:55:26,092 --> 00:55:27,300
Why do you go there?

813
00:55:27,508 --> 00:55:28,508
- Take pictures? - No.

814
00:55:28,592 --> 00:55:29,717
My father owned the land there.

815
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:30,842
I have come to sell it.

816
00:55:30,925 --> 00:55:31,758
What is the name of your father?

817
00:55:32,133 --> 00:55:32,842
Rathnavel.

818
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:37,050
My mother's name Lakshmi.
They are from the village.

819
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:38,092
- Oh .. - Come on.

820
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:06,133
Come here.

821
00:56:06,425 --> 00:56:09,925
You got me started into the
alley, where kissing couples?

822
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,925
One hundred grams early in the morning?

823
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:15,133
You buhim with his face!

824
00:56:15,217 --> 00:56:17,550
Who do you look like.

825
00:56:21,133 --> 00:56:23,092
"He asked the way to the
dilapidated pavilion."

826
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:24,008
"We told him."

827
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:29,800
In this village there
is a real estate agent?

828
00:56:30,508 --> 00:56:33,717
Here there is no one right to sell the land.

829
00:56:33,925 --> 00:56:36,425
Then how can I sell my land?

830
00:56:36,842 --> 00:56:42,883
Only with the help of Mr. Singariyara.

831
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:45,050
Singariyar?

832
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:00,008
- Break there coconut. - Good.

833
00:57:24,508 --> 00:57:26,717
- Do not you see, sir go? - Hey!

834
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:30,217
Our fault that we did not see
how it breaks a coconut.

835
00:57:30,675 --> 00:57:32,175
Why yell at him?

836
00:57:33,092 --> 00:57:34,383
Get away.

837
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:36,008
You are not from here?

838
00:57:36,092 --> 00:57:36,758
Yes, sir.

839
00:57:36,842 --> 00:57:39,758
I'm from Chennai, but my mother from the village.

840
00:57:39,925 --> 00:57:42,175
- I came to sell the land of my father.
- Hello.

841
00:57:42,217 --> 00:57:43,550
Brother wants to talk to you, Father.

842
00:57:47,258 --> 00:57:48,383
Dharma? Speak.

843
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:51,050
Son Rathnavela in our village.

844
00:57:52,008 --> 00:57:53,008
Gnanavel?

845
00:57:53,842 --> 00:57:55,300
Rathnavel!

846
00:57:55,425 --> 00:57:57,675
You have a motorcycle? I do not hear no words.

847
00:57:57,967 --> 00:57:58,717
Vetrivel?

848
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,258
No, Rathnavel!

849
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:02,050
- Dad! - I can not hear you.

850
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:03,258
Let's talk when you get back home.

851
00:58:05,258 --> 00:58:07,425
The signal is weak. I'll talk to him later.

852
00:58:07,508 --> 00:58:08,592
Who did you come to meet?

853
00:58:08,675 --> 00:58:10,508
You know Mr. Singariyara?

854
00:58:10,592 --> 00:58:12,800
I'm looking for him.

855
00:58:14,883 --> 00:58:17,883
You came to meet me, and hit me
in the forehead with a coconut!

856
00:58:18,342 --> 00:58:20,300
A. You the man I was looking for.

857
00:58:20,383 --> 00:58:21,842
I'm sorry. That's my fault.

858
00:58:21,925 --> 00:58:23,592
What is the name of your father?

859
00:58:23,675 --> 00:58:24,217
The name of my father...

860
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,008
The guardian of the temple wants to talk to you.

861
00:58:26,592 --> 00:58:27,800
- I'll be right back. - Yes sir.

862
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:30,300
Let's not talk about business here.

863
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,008
Talk home after dinner.

864
00:58:34,217 --> 00:58:35,592
I do not want to bother you.

865
00:58:35,675 --> 00:58:37,092
I could eat at the hotel,
and then to come to you.

866
00:58:37,175 --> 00:58:37,967
What are you talking about?

867
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:40,550
How can you come to my father...

868
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,508
... And do not eat in our house ?!

869
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:44,967
You are not familiar with our
famous hospitality? Let's go to.

870
00:58:46,467 --> 00:58:47,842
Come with us. Not sestnyaysya.

871
01:00:10,550 --> 01:00:13,550
It is the home or room station?

872
01:00:13,883 --> 01:00:15,383
This is huge!

873
01:00:15,467 --> 01:00:18,342
While chutney bring food into
the room, it becomes rancid.

874
01:00:19,258 --> 01:00:20,300
Hi Grandpa.

875
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:22,633
Will call my grandmother?

876
01:00:22,717 --> 01:00:23,550
Now.

877
01:00:23,758 --> 01:00:24,800
- Have you eaten? - Test.

878
01:00:25,008 --> 01:00:26,133
- Come on. - How are you doing?

879
01:00:26,217 --> 01:00:26,883
It's all right.

880
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:27,967
You have come to the priest?

881
01:00:28,050 --> 01:00:28,758
Yes.

882
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:30,592
Injure your forehead. How did it happen?

883
01:00:30,675 --> 01:00:32,508
Do not worry, this guy...

884
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:39,467
Go here.

885
01:00:42,883 --> 01:00:43,883
What are you looking at?

886
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:48,175
In an era when people are themselves like animals...

887
01:00:48,425 --> 01:00:51,133
... Do you feel about the cows,
as if they were human beings!

888
01:00:51,633 --> 01:00:53,300
Your heart more than your house, sir.

889
01:00:57,925 --> 01:01:01,467
Hey look! This cow pees like
too much to drink beer !!

890
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:04,008
If you fill it in a bottle and
sell in the shop, as the booze...

891
01:01:04,092 --> 01:01:05,217
... It will be a profitable business.

892
01:01:05,383 --> 01:01:07,008
Why art thou all the money?

893
01:01:07,258 --> 01:01:10,508
What about. If I owned
all these cows...

894
01:01:10,717 --> 01:01:12,758
... I would buy a car
to sell cow dung.

895
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:15,550
- You called me? - Where is my youngest?

896
01:01:15,925 --> 01:01:16,883
Upstairs.

897
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,258
Vanati. Vanati.

898
01:01:21,008 --> 01:01:22,842
Coming, Mom.

899
01:01:23,008 --> 01:01:24,300
My sister calls you, go down.

900
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:25,800
Wait, uncle.

901
01:01:26,758 --> 01:01:30,925
If you're not going
to be mad at me.

902
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:31,967
Your turn.

903
01:01:32,425 --> 01:01:33,175
Go down.

904
01:01:33,258 --> 01:01:34,050
Uncle!

905
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:35,925
Go.

906
01:01:37,592 --> 01:01:39,092
What, Mom?

907
01:01:39,425 --> 01:01:40,675
Hey! Vremelёt!

908
01:01:41,550 --> 01:01:43,925
Hello. Vanati.

909
01:01:44,008 --> 01:01:44,800
You?

910
01:01:45,717 --> 01:01:47,550
Here it is, therefore, an interesting type?

911
01:01:53,133 --> 01:01:53,800
Hello.

912
01:01:53,883 --> 01:01:57,550
- Listen. This is your house? - Yes.

913
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,175
You Vanati met before?

914
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:02,383
He traveled with me on the train, Dad.

915
01:02:02,675 --> 01:02:04,925
Why are not you crying with me at the station?

916
01:02:05,175 --> 01:02:06,383
All because of you.

917
01:02:06,633 --> 01:02:07,883
- Because of me? - Yes.

918
01:02:08,175 --> 01:02:12,008
You have forgotten your album in a hurry.

919
01:02:12,217 --> 01:02:14,925
As I lifted him from the
floor, the train started.

920
01:02:17,217 --> 01:02:20,258
You missed my station
for the album?

921
01:02:20,508 --> 01:02:21,633
I do not believe it!

922
01:02:29,133 --> 01:02:31,050
Brother, I Vanati uncle, Raja.

923
01:02:31,258 --> 01:02:33,925
As Raja - means king, do not ask me
about the whereabouts of my army!

924
01:02:34,008 --> 01:02:34,800
Because I'm a doctor.

925
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:40,050
I'm afraid rassmeyatsya this joke,
so as not to hurt your feelings.

926
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:43,258
What's so funny?

927
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:45,967
The village elders
are here to see you.

928
01:02:46,217 --> 01:02:47,133
Good.

929
01:02:47,717 --> 01:02:49,842
Freshen yet. I will be soon.

930
01:02:50,175 --> 01:02:51,050
Good.

931
01:02:52,133 --> 01:02:53,675
Brother, let's go.

932
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:00,592
Why are these two buffalo staring at us?

933
01:03:00,675 --> 01:03:02,675
It trophies of my grandfather.

934
01:03:04,092 --> 01:03:07,883
Do you call trophies...

935
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:09,425
... As if that lion's head?

936
01:03:09,508 --> 01:03:11,342
- What's wrong? - I'll explain.

937
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:13,675
Take a good look at him.

938
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:16,758
Does not he look like a doorman
at the hotel "Chettinad"?

939
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:19,133
- You call it a hunter? - Vremelёt.

940
01:03:19,175 --> 01:03:20,717
If my grandfather could hear you...

941
01:03:20,883 --> 01:03:23,300
He would say, "I am ashamed, son."

942
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:25,633
Why give points for hunting buvola ?!

943
01:03:25,717 --> 01:03:26,633
See.

944
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,425
Have you seen this funny portrait?

945
01:03:39,758 --> 01:03:41,550
Hey!

946
01:03:45,717 --> 01:03:47,300
Where do you live in Chennai?

947
01:03:47,550 --> 01:03:48,383
Kakkatope.

948
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,217
Grove crow ?!

949
01:03:50,508 --> 01:03:53,467
Why are you writhed face, as if you
went to the toilet the bus stop?

950
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:56,675
In any case, there is not as
calm and peaceful as it is here.

951
01:03:57,008 --> 01:04:00,842
Crowds, pollution, traffic,
stench of the river, a sin.

952
01:04:01,008 --> 01:04:03,092
Murder, forgery, deception.

953
01:04:03,425 --> 01:04:05,217
How can we live?

954
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,883
Why did you stop, brother? Come on.

955
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,383
How can you humiliate so Madras?

956
01:04:11,592 --> 01:04:13,300
What do you know about Madras?

957
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:15,800
Software literate, night-clothes
for the illiterate.

958
01:04:15,883 --> 01:04:18,217
Buses festivals.

959
01:04:18,383 --> 01:04:20,633
Cricket stadiums, hospitals.

960
01:04:20,717 --> 01:04:25,383
Unemployed, who was sleeping on the
beach, he is now riding on his Mercedes.

961
01:04:25,592 --> 01:04:28,425
Everything moves at a pace.

962
01:04:28,508 --> 01:04:30,758
Anyone who thinks that he is not
up for life, Madras is his savior.

963
01:04:30,842 --> 01:04:31,592
Cool, cool.

964
01:04:31,675 --> 01:04:32,883
Why so upset?

965
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:37,092
Actors Sasikumar and Vishal,
praise full Madurai.

966
01:04:37,258 --> 01:04:39,425
I'm can glorify Madras, right?

967
01:04:40,467 --> 01:04:41,217
Thank you.

968
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,925
Water cooled. Take a shower.

969
01:04:43,592 --> 01:04:44,800
One minute.

970
01:04:44,842 --> 01:04:48,300
On the train, I saw the ugly bald.

971
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,842
That was me!

972
01:04:49,925 --> 01:04:51,925
Hair fell out or did
you shave your head?

973
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,092
Your hands so hairy?

974
01:04:53,175 --> 01:04:53,925
True?

975
01:04:54,383 --> 01:04:55,133
I'm sorry.

976
01:04:55,758 --> 01:04:56,467
Let's go.

977
01:05:05,717 --> 01:05:06,633
Hey!

978
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:09,175
Hey!

979
01:05:09,925 --> 01:05:12,008
I have sent to you man. Where is he?

980
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:14,425
Klechatoy guy in a shirt with a backpack.

981
01:05:14,508 --> 01:05:15,592
Backpack...

982
01:05:15,675 --> 01:05:17,508
Yes, that guy.

983
01:05:18,550 --> 01:05:21,050
If you do not say, I'll
fuck you to death.

984
01:05:21,133 --> 01:05:23,758
No, please, no. I want a little whiskey.

985
01:05:24,175 --> 01:05:25,717
Hey! You!

986
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:34,967
Hey, where are you?

987
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,675
What are you waiting for? Getting.

988
01:05:38,425 --> 01:05:41,258
The first time I see so many
helpful people around me.

989
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:42,800
For us our guests as God.

990
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:46,467
No matter what we offer to God, we
also offer our guests the most.

991
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:48,550
I do not want to repeat, but I will say.

992
01:05:48,633 --> 01:05:50,217
Your heart more than your house.

993
01:05:51,175 --> 01:05:52,092
Give him a holy fish.

994
01:05:52,175 --> 01:05:53,133
Holy fish?

995
01:05:53,467 --> 01:05:54,300
Do not like it?

996
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,133
1500 rupees per kilogram.

997
01:05:56,342 --> 01:05:59,383
I have to take out a bank
loan to buy the fish, sir.

998
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:02,592
Do not laugh too.

999
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,383
Album is not the reason that he was here.

1000
01:06:05,758 --> 01:06:07,842
He crush on you!

1001
01:06:08,592 --> 01:06:09,883
Uncle?

1002
01:06:10,133 --> 01:06:12,925
In still waters run deep!

1003
01:06:13,133 --> 01:06:15,467
Ostvte such talk after
the wedding, you two.

1004
01:06:15,592 --> 01:06:18,508
Oh, no. She overheard it all wrong!

1005
01:06:23,717 --> 01:06:24,925
How lamb?

1006
01:06:25,425 --> 01:06:26,258
Super!

1007
01:06:26,550 --> 01:06:27,467
Eat some more.

1008
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:31,592
If I eat a little more, my burst
with buttons of his shirt.

1009
01:06:35,383 --> 01:06:38,467
I do not want to see
my belly doubled.

1010
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:50,133
Why are you here?

1011
01:06:50,217 --> 01:06:51,633
You have already met with the Dharma?

1012
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:53,883
He drove me on his bike.

1013
01:06:53,967 --> 01:06:55,008
He is my eldest son.

1014
01:06:55,217 --> 01:06:58,425
Oh! "The Lion King N. 1". "The Lion King 2 N.".

1015
01:06:58,925 --> 01:07:01,300
Father, I want to tell you something urgent.

1016
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:02,383
Why the rush?

1017
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:03,800
Wash hands. Eat, then we'll talk.

1018
01:07:03,883 --> 01:07:04,925
Cali, come with me.

1019
01:07:07,425 --> 01:07:08,508
It is always so impulsive.

1020
01:07:08,592 --> 01:07:09,550
I'll be right back.

1021
01:07:12,425 --> 01:07:16,592
I met three members of one family
in three different places.

1022
01:07:16,758 --> 01:07:19,258
How did it happen? Absolutely amazing.

1023
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,092
Yes.

1024
01:07:21,133 --> 01:07:25,467
What happened so serious that you
gave to our guest safely eat?

1025
01:07:25,758 --> 01:07:27,633
It is not our guest, father.

1026
01:07:31,925 --> 01:07:35,383
It Rathnavela son, your brother's killer.

1027
01:07:45,133 --> 01:07:46,592
Then why do we spend
time talking?

1028
01:07:47,425 --> 01:07:48,883
I chopped him to pieces right now.

1029
01:07:49,258 --> 01:07:50,175
No, Cali.

1030
01:07:50,425 --> 01:07:51,300
Why?

1031
01:07:52,425 --> 01:07:55,967
My anger is ten times stronger than yours.

1032
01:07:56,717 --> 01:08:00,175
My blood boils. I
want to kill him now.

1033
01:08:01,342 --> 01:08:05,925
But in this house never
shed a drop of blood.

1034
01:08:06,008 --> 01:08:07,258
So, we just let him go?

1035
01:08:13,925 --> 01:08:15,342
I will not spare his life.

1036
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:21,633
As soon as he goes beyond the threshold of the
house, his head will fall off the shoulders.

1037
01:08:25,425 --> 01:08:27,508
I have waited for this moment for 27 years.

1038
01:08:28,258 --> 01:08:30,300
So why not wait a little longer?

1039
01:08:31,008 --> 01:08:32,425
- Cali. - Yes, Father?

1040
01:08:32,508 --> 01:08:34,675
Tell our people.

1041
01:08:34,883 --> 01:08:35,800
Yes, Father.

1042
01:08:37,508 --> 01:08:39,050
- Hey! - Brother?

1043
01:08:39,133 --> 01:08:43,592
The visitor of our house will
live as long as it is inside.

1044
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:47,133
Kill him as soon as he goes beyond the threshold.

1045
01:08:48,133 --> 01:08:50,092
- Go! - Let's go.

1046
01:08:52,633 --> 01:08:54,508
Tell me the reason for your visit.

1047
01:08:54,842 --> 01:08:57,342
My father owned land in this village.

1048
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,175
I want to meet with you to
help you sell the land.

1049
01:09:00,592 --> 01:09:01,633
That's all?

1050
01:09:02,050 --> 01:09:03,508
I myself can buy it from you.

1051
01:09:04,217 --> 01:09:07,008
Let's see this place,
and make a deal.

1052
01:09:07,258 --> 01:09:10,383
I never thought that everything would be so easy.

1053
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:12,383
I'm so glad. Thank you sir.

1054
01:09:12,467 --> 01:09:14,758
- Come? - Yes sir.

1055
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:16,217
Wait, Grandpa.

1056
01:09:16,508 --> 01:09:17,258
Uncle, sit down.

1057
01:09:17,508 --> 01:09:19,425
You promised to play with us in the afternoon.

1058
01:09:19,508 --> 01:09:20,467
Play?

1059
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,092
- Oh yes! I forgot. - Children.

1060
01:09:22,175 --> 01:09:23,758
Uncle little busy right now.

1061
01:09:23,842 --> 01:09:24,800
Play Uncle Raja.

1062
01:09:24,883 --> 01:09:25,508
- No - Go here.

1063
01:09:25,592 --> 01:09:27,425
We want to play with Uncle Shakti.

1064
01:09:27,508 --> 01:09:28,258
No...

1065
01:09:28,342 --> 01:09:29,133
Nothing, sir.

1066
01:09:29,217 --> 01:09:32,383
They are children. Just play a little bit.

1067
01:09:32,425 --> 01:09:33,967
Bring cloth blindfold.

1068
01:09:34,175 --> 01:09:35,342
Hurrah, hurray!

1069
01:09:35,925 --> 01:09:37,675
Sister, you will first drive.

1070
01:09:38,133 --> 01:09:39,092
Good.

1071
01:09:39,383 --> 01:09:42,425
Madame and do not see anything,
except for one person!

1072
01:09:42,717 --> 01:09:43,717
Shut up!

1073
01:09:44,508 --> 01:09:45,592
Let me tie.

1074
01:09:49,258 --> 01:09:49,967
Uncle.

1075
01:09:51,883 --> 01:09:53,425
- Vanati. - Here.

1076
01:09:53,508 --> 01:09:55,925
- Here, here. - Vanati here.

1077
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:57,967
In this side.

1078
01:09:58,633 --> 01:10:00,383
Vanati, I'm here.

1079
01:10:00,467 --> 01:10:02,425
- I'm sorry. - She's coming for you.

1080
01:10:02,508 --> 01:10:04,425
- Here. - Do not go there.

1081
01:10:04,508 --> 01:10:07,550
- Oh no! - Do not go there. Come this way

1082
01:10:07,633 --> 01:10:08,467
- Vanati here. - Grandmother.

1083
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:09,592
Here, here.

1084
01:10:09,675 --> 01:10:12,092
I'm back.

1085
01:10:12,508 --> 01:10:14,383
- Come this way. - Aunt, catch me.

1086
01:10:17,842 --> 01:10:19,133
- O. - Beware!

1087
01:10:19,342 --> 01:10:20,550
- Hey! - Over here!

1088
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:21,467
Grab it.

1089
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:23,508
- In this way. - Catch it.

1090
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:26,925
If you go out, you lose.

1091
01:10:42,967 --> 01:10:44,300
Uncle Raja.

1092
01:10:44,883 --> 01:10:46,092
All here.

1093
01:10:46,717 --> 01:10:47,675
In this side.

1094
01:10:47,883 --> 01:10:50,425
- There's no way. - We are now caught.

1095
01:10:53,092 --> 01:10:54,300
- Here, here. - Come here!

1096
01:11:06,092 --> 01:11:08,175
This bedroom for ghosts?

1097
01:11:14,925 --> 01:11:16,300
Pictures of my mother ?!

1098
01:11:24,342 --> 01:11:26,508
Who's next to my mother?

1099
01:11:29,175 --> 01:11:31,050
"There was a family feud,
which has not been solved."

1100
01:11:31,258 --> 01:11:33,758
"And if you go there, your
life will be in danger."

1101
01:11:33,842 --> 01:11:35,758
"That's why your mother has not sold the land..."

1102
01:11:35,842 --> 01:11:37,217
"... And the maid worked all the time."

1103
01:11:40,508 --> 01:11:42,550
"Father, I want to tell you something urgent."

1104
01:11:42,717 --> 01:11:44,008
"Why the rush?"

1105
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,300
"Wash your hands. Eat, then we'll talk."

1106
01:11:45,508 --> 01:11:46,550
"Kali, come with me."

1107
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,300
What's up, brother?

1108
01:12:00,758 --> 01:12:02,342
We were going to kill him
when he leaves the house.

1109
01:12:02,717 --> 01:12:04,217
But he was playing hide and seek.

1110
01:12:05,217 --> 01:12:06,967
What is the difference where to nail him?

1111
01:12:07,050 --> 01:12:08,092
In the house or not?

1112
01:12:10,383 --> 01:12:11,842
Kali, do not get excited.

1113
01:12:12,217 --> 01:12:13,508
We can not disobey his father.

1114
01:12:13,883 --> 01:12:16,050
It is a tradition of our family.

1115
01:12:16,425 --> 01:12:17,633
In the house it is protected.

1116
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:21,425
But as soon as it comes out, the
crescent moon will do the trick!

1117
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:50,342
Uncle, where have you been so long?

1118
01:12:50,675 --> 01:12:52,508
Uncle, it's your turn
to be blindfolded.

1119
01:12:52,592 --> 01:12:53,092
Go.

1120
01:12:53,175 --> 01:12:56,758
Enough games. It's time to go.

1121
01:12:58,008 --> 01:13:03,633
Let me play a few games with them.
Where are we in a hurry?

1122
01:13:04,883 --> 01:13:07,092
They are children. Let them play.

1123
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,592
Let's first finish our business.

1124
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:11,300
Come?

1125
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:29,675
I think I left my bag at the top.

1126
01:13:29,758 --> 01:13:31,092
Your bag here.

1127
01:13:33,842 --> 01:13:35,633
Oh! She is here, right?

1128
01:13:46,967 --> 01:13:49,300
I returned the album?

1129
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,092
Yes, of course.

1130
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,925
Oh, yes! I gave him.

1131
01:13:56,967 --> 01:13:58,633
- Bye. - Bye dear.

1132
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,467
Bye.

1133
01:14:00,008 --> 01:14:01,842
- Bye, dear. - Till.

1134
01:14:07,633 --> 01:14:09,633
Let me say goodbye to your wife.

1135
01:14:11,300 --> 01:14:12,300
- I'll go. - Bye.

1136
01:14:12,675 --> 01:14:13,717
- Goodbye. - Bye.

1137
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:24,092
I forgot to ask.

1138
01:14:24,467 --> 01:14:26,842
How do you cook so delicious lamb?

1139
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:29,008
Brother, what's the problem? A very simple recipe.

1140
01:14:29,092 --> 01:14:32,050
Before you cook the lamb, add
chopped onions and tomatoes.

1141
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:34,050
Grind ginger and garlic into a paste.

1142
01:14:34,133 --> 01:14:36,050
Add one teaspoon
of salt and cook.

1143
01:14:36,258 --> 01:14:38,258
Next, add two teaspoons
of ground pepper.

1144
01:14:38,467 --> 01:14:39,425
Enough!

1145
01:14:40,217 --> 01:14:42,592
Two teaspoons of ground
pepper is enough?

1146
01:14:42,675 --> 01:14:43,675
Stop wasting time talking.

1147
01:14:43,758 --> 01:14:44,675
Let's go.

1148
01:14:47,925 --> 01:14:49,633
- Oh, no. - What now?

1149
01:14:50,092 --> 01:14:51,508
I can not find my wallet.

1150
01:14:51,592 --> 01:14:53,050
It is my return ticket.

1151
01:14:53,133 --> 01:14:54,300
Hey! Find him.

1152
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:12,175
"He saw the purse in my hand."

1153
01:15:13,633 --> 01:15:14,800
I found it here.

1154
01:15:22,633 --> 01:15:23,717
So far, Uncle.

1155
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,383
How many times do you say goodbye ?!

1156
01:15:25,467 --> 01:15:26,800
It's just a kid.

1157
01:15:27,508 --> 01:15:28,842
- Bye, dear. - Till.

1158
01:15:29,425 --> 01:15:30,925
- I'll see you. - See you, bye.

1159
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:43,675
Where are you going?

1160
01:15:44,758 --> 01:15:46,300
Let me also say
goodbye sacred cows!

1161
01:16:29,467 --> 01:16:30,717
I do not know why.

1162
01:16:31,092 --> 01:16:33,717
But I do not want to leave this place.

1163
01:16:34,467 --> 01:16:38,425
Cows, this house, this column.

1164
01:16:39,258 --> 01:16:42,508
I feel like a schoolboy...

1165
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:47,342
... I do not want to go to school after the holidays!

1166
01:16:47,717 --> 01:16:51,758
In this paradise so
much love and care.

1167
01:16:52,967 --> 01:16:54,717
I'll show you a real paradise.

1168
01:16:55,175 --> 01:16:56,508
Come with me.

1169
01:16:57,133 --> 01:16:59,842
Gauri inside Bring children.

1170
01:17:00,467 --> 01:17:02,300
Let's go.

1171
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:19,508
Let me pray to God before I go.

1172
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,508
Mom!

1173
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:19,717
Shakti?

1174
01:18:20,508 --> 01:18:22,175
- Shakti! What happened? - Oh no!

1175
01:18:22,550 --> 01:18:23,425
- Oh. - Are you hurt?

1176
01:18:27,008 --> 01:18:27,758
What do you expect?

1177
01:18:27,842 --> 01:18:29,258
Let's take him to a hospital nearby.

1178
01:18:29,425 --> 01:18:31,508
There is no need to go to hospital.

1179
01:18:31,592 --> 01:18:34,300
I can not move. It hurts.

1180
01:18:34,383 --> 01:18:35,508
Move.

1181
01:18:35,592 --> 01:18:37,175
- Bring a wooden board. - Faster.

1182
01:18:38,508 --> 01:18:39,050
Hurt?

1183
01:18:39,133 --> 01:18:40,300
No .. Do not touch me.

1184
01:18:40,467 --> 01:18:41,508
It's okay.

1185
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:43,758
Physical therapy works wonders.
Soon he gets on his feet.

1186
01:18:44,758 --> 01:18:45,633
Get down on this board.

1187
01:18:45,717 --> 01:18:47,758
I can not stand the distance.

1188
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,967
I just want to refer you to the bed.

1189
01:18:51,342 --> 01:18:53,800
- Keep it. - Raise.

1190
01:18:53,967 --> 01:18:56,675
Look at his feet.

1191
01:19:39,383 --> 01:19:41,550
Put it on the bed.

1192
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,925
Warning. Caution.

1193
01:19:44,008 --> 01:19:45,008
About Mom!

1194
01:19:45,508 --> 01:19:47,258
How do you feel?

1195
01:19:47,342 --> 01:19:49,467
How behemoth napivshiysya water.

1196
01:19:49,883 --> 01:19:51,883
- Let rest. - Good.

1197
01:19:52,175 --> 01:19:54,217
- Aunt, need hot water. - Good.

1198
01:19:54,675 --> 01:19:57,883
- Come on, aunt.
- He came to our house and hurt.

1199
01:19:59,258 --> 01:20:00,842
It hurts?

1200
01:20:02,008 --> 01:20:03,925
- Now? - Uh-huh.

1201
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:06,217
What's wrong, Uncle?

1202
01:20:06,425 --> 01:20:08,425
His bones were cracked.

1203
01:20:08,633 --> 01:20:10,092
No muscle strain.

1204
01:20:10,175 --> 01:20:13,800
About Mom!

1205
01:20:14,508 --> 01:20:16,967
Perhaps he crashed loin.

1206
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:18,967
- What then will become of him?
- If he is injured...

1207
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:21,217
That affected the nerves
of the spine to the brain.

1208
01:20:22,175 --> 01:20:24,758
It will yawn...

1209
01:20:25,717 --> 01:20:26,508
... Sneezing.

1210
01:20:27,925 --> 01:20:29,633
That's what he did, his uncle.

1211
01:20:29,717 --> 01:20:31,258
Confirmed.

1212
01:20:31,383 --> 01:20:32,842
This is the same.

1213
01:20:34,508 --> 01:20:35,258
What does this mean?

1214
01:20:35,675 --> 01:20:36,967
Let's go out, I say.

1215
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:40,675
Shakti rest. You will recover soon.

1216
01:20:40,758 --> 01:20:42,300
- Rest. - Let's go out.

1217
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,925
About Mom.

1218
01:20:49,550 --> 01:20:51,133
Are you scared?

1219
01:20:52,342 --> 01:20:53,592
You stink armpits.

1220
01:20:57,133 --> 01:20:58,550
Poeryatsya! Go rinse your mouth!

1221
01:20:59,967 --> 01:21:03,217
You are silent and do not say that to him.

1222
01:21:03,508 --> 01:21:05,425
It is in a serious condition?

1223
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:07,467
Quite a bit.

1224
01:21:07,842 --> 01:21:09,425
So why do not you examined it?

1225
01:21:09,675 --> 01:21:11,175
You're his medicine!

1226
01:21:11,550 --> 01:21:12,925
What are you saying, uncle?

1227
01:21:13,175 --> 01:21:14,883
If he leaves this place,
he can not see you.

1228
01:21:14,967 --> 01:21:16,050
So he breaks comedy.

1229
01:21:16,217 --> 01:21:17,300
Do not boltatay too much, Uncle.

1230
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:19,300
Do not you see what?

1231
01:21:19,467 --> 01:21:21,300
Will someone yawn, getting injured?

1232
01:21:21,967 --> 01:21:23,383
But you said it yourself.

1233
01:21:23,592 --> 01:21:24,883
I have tested it.

1234
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:29,133
You are so naive? He's in love with you.

1235
01:21:30,050 --> 01:21:31,133
In Love?

1236
01:21:33,050 --> 01:21:34,467
I can not believe it, Uncle.

1237
01:21:35,008 --> 01:21:36,800
It is only when there is something
in what you do not believe...

1238
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:38,300
... Life takes on new meaning.

1239
01:21:39,467 --> 01:21:43,133
He tries using his
wit, to be your hero!

1240
01:21:44,258 --> 01:21:46,967
Mr. Shakti, rock star!

1241
01:25:25,883 --> 01:25:27,758
Dreaming?

1242
01:25:27,967 --> 01:25:29,133
The poor man!

1243
01:25:29,217 --> 01:25:31,258
He wants the impossible.

1244
01:25:31,758 --> 01:25:34,008
I'll tell him. I'm not in love with him.

1245
01:25:34,217 --> 01:25:37,258
Wait, why are you in a hurry?

1246
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:39,550
He tried so hard.

1247
01:25:39,925 --> 01:25:42,175
Let stay here for one more day.

1248
01:25:42,258 --> 01:25:43,383
You never know.

1249
01:25:43,467 --> 01:25:46,300
A lot can happen
in the next day!

1250
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:47,550
Mozhetet be you
even reciprocate!

1251
01:25:48,258 --> 01:25:49,258
Uncle!

1252
01:25:52,508 --> 01:25:57,592
"Hands off, asshole!
I'm fragile, be careful."

1253
01:25:57,758 --> 01:25:59,217
"Oh my God!"

1254
01:26:06,092 --> 01:26:08,383
"Mother dear!"

1255
01:26:13,508 --> 01:26:16,133
"Get your hands off me, fat man."

1256
01:26:18,092 --> 01:26:22,008
"Hey, you're a glutton. What otel ass!"

1257
01:26:22,258 --> 01:26:26,967
"Oh, my God. I did it."

1258
01:26:27,175 --> 01:26:32,342
"His hundred tons slowed my progress."

1259
01:26:32,425 --> 01:26:34,508
"Oh my God."

1260
01:26:36,550 --> 01:26:38,925
"You can not get away from here."

1261
01:26:39,008 --> 01:26:42,092
"You're a corpse, Mr. Bond."

1262
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:49,967
"Life - a long jump from
the cradle to the grave."

1263
01:26:50,592 --> 01:26:54,258
About Mom.

1264
01:26:54,508 --> 01:26:56,217
Are you feeling better?

1265
01:26:56,842 --> 01:26:59,092
You are very smart, son.

1266
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:04,050
You very well know
how to avoid danger.

1267
01:27:04,592 --> 01:27:07,425
I meant your focus with a swing.

1268
01:27:07,842 --> 01:27:09,925
All this is a matter of time.

1269
01:27:10,842 --> 01:27:13,342
If the time is favorable to you...

1270
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:15,883
... Even lightning
can not hurt you.

1271
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:22,550
But if your time is up, even a
small nail file can kill you.

1272
01:27:26,592 --> 01:27:33,175
It's time to pay for the
sins of their parents.

1273
01:27:35,133 --> 01:27:39,592
Why should a child be punished
for the sins of their parents?

1274
01:27:40,508 --> 01:27:46,258
If you have inherited their wealth,
why not inherit their sin?

1275
01:27:53,842 --> 01:27:56,300
I could not finish my work today.

1276
01:27:56,717 --> 01:27:59,383
But I'll do it tomorrow.

1277
01:28:48,342 --> 01:28:50,717
Know Murugan?
I married his svoyachnitse.

1278
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,842
- Yes? - Yes.

1279
01:28:54,467 --> 01:28:56,258
Who's there?

1280
01:28:56,342 --> 01:28:57,383
Give me some water.

1281
01:28:57,467 --> 01:28:58,467
Now, brother.

1282
01:29:05,425 --> 01:29:07,133
- There are smoking? - No.

1283
01:31:27,675 --> 01:31:29,800
Hey! Look up!

1284
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:31,883
All here.

1285
01:31:31,967 --> 01:31:33,508
Throw knives! Come on!

1286
01:31:34,258 --> 01:31:35,925
Hit it! Let's!

1287
01:31:36,008 --> 01:31:37,300
Higher, higher!

1288
01:31:40,258 --> 01:31:41,758
Come on!

1289
01:31:49,592 --> 01:31:52,050
Hey, go down it down.

1290
01:32:14,467 --> 01:32:17,008
Vremelёt! What happened?

1291
01:32:24,008 --> 01:32:25,758
Back hurts?

1292
01:32:26,008 --> 01:32:27,592
I have forgotten, right?

1293
01:32:27,883 --> 01:32:28,592
What?

1294
01:32:28,675 --> 01:32:30,467
I forgot to tell you. I'm fine.

1295
01:32:30,758 --> 01:32:31,717
How?

1296
01:32:31,967 --> 01:32:35,967
Last night I dreamed I went for a drive
around the temple, and I fell out of bed.

1297
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:37,092
Now, I'm fine.

1298
01:32:37,175 --> 01:32:39,217
Let's go see the land?

1299
01:32:40,092 --> 01:32:41,967
But your father must be still asleep?

1300
01:32:42,050 --> 01:32:43,758
He got up at 5:00 am.

1301
01:32:44,092 --> 01:32:45,383
Let's go.

1302
01:32:45,675 --> 01:32:46,717
My Bag?

1303
01:32:53,467 --> 01:32:55,175
I have to take a shower.

1304
01:33:00,217 --> 01:33:00,883
Uncle!

1305
01:33:00,967 --> 01:33:02,425
It gave you a flower?

1306
01:33:03,217 --> 01:33:06,675
"What do you say, my beautiful beautiful?"

1307
01:33:06,758 --> 01:33:07,758
Uncle, do not be ridiculous.

1308
01:33:07,842 --> 01:33:09,675
Enough to blush. Lost!

1309
01:33:50,008 --> 01:33:52,508
Father, he is playing a comedy,
sitting inside the house.

1310
01:33:52,967 --> 01:33:56,717
It is understood that we will kill him if he
will come out into the street, his father.

1311
01:33:58,133 --> 01:33:59,717
I knew it yesterday.

1312
01:34:03,342 --> 01:34:05,092
So why are you silent?

1313
01:34:05,175 --> 01:34:06,675
Why do not you cut him to pieces?

1314
01:34:07,300 --> 01:34:10,342
It is a choice of destiny.

1315
01:34:10,883 --> 01:34:14,883
Have you ever noticed what
day fate brought him here?

1316
01:34:15,467 --> 01:34:18,258
Today is the anniversary of my brother's death.

1317
01:34:18,717 --> 01:34:24,383
I'll kill him the day the day,
when his father killed my brother.

1318
01:34:47,300 --> 01:34:50,883
Why there was such a crowd?

1319
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:01,425
Even the cook threatened me as
the villain of the Tamil film.

1320
01:35:11,383 --> 01:35:13,342
You washed so long?

1321
01:35:13,425 --> 01:35:16,467
It seems to be standing with a
stopwatch while I showered!

1322
01:35:16,550 --> 01:35:17,425
What did you say?

1323
01:35:18,133 --> 01:35:20,633
I have not Mochalov.
So it took a long time.

1324
01:35:20,717 --> 01:35:23,300
Why are there so many people?

1325
01:35:23,383 --> 01:35:25,050
Ritual on the anniversary of the death of my uncle.

1326
01:35:25,133 --> 01:35:26,842
How did he die? Heart attack?

1327
01:35:26,925 --> 01:35:31,800
My uncle and his son killed each other.

1328
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:36,883
My uncle made a vow to destroy
the entire family of the killer.

1329
01:35:40,842 --> 01:35:43,425
You're a doctor, you can not tell
him that it is an obsession...

1330
01:35:43,508 --> 01:35:47,592
... Given the fact that each party has
lost the gate, the match ends in a draw.

1331
01:35:47,675 --> 01:35:50,050
Then my parents will lose a wicket!

1332
01:35:50,133 --> 01:35:52,133
You do not know the true nature of my uncle.

1333
01:35:52,467 --> 01:35:53,758
You go.

1334
01:35:53,842 --> 01:35:56,133
How can I leave in the middle of the ritual?

1335
01:35:56,217 --> 01:35:59,342
I asked you to join the prayer.

1336
01:36:01,842 --> 01:36:03,217
Why do not you go?

1337
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:08,050
She has some work.
It will come in the near future.

1338
01:36:27,008 --> 01:36:28,717
Bring flowers to the deity.

1339
01:36:32,675 --> 01:36:34,092
Not here!

1340
01:36:54,258 --> 01:36:57,592
Pray that the soul of the
deceased rest in peace.

1341
01:36:57,883 --> 01:36:59,133
Holy crap!

1342
01:36:59,342 --> 01:37:02,467
If no revenge for his death, as
will his soul rest in peace?

1343
01:37:02,842 --> 01:37:05,258
Singariyar, when are you going
to kill the heir Rathnavela...

1344
01:37:05,342 --> 01:37:07,008
... And to appease the soul of your brother?

1345
01:37:07,092 --> 01:37:09,800
Sooner than you expect, uncle.

1346
01:37:11,258 --> 01:37:13,633
You will witness this event.

1347
01:37:14,633 --> 01:37:16,092
More.

1348
01:37:16,592 --> 01:37:19,008
Close your eyes and meditate.

1349
01:37:47,342 --> 01:37:48,425
What happened?

1350
01:37:48,508 --> 01:37:50,383
Nothing. Sit down.

1351
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:04,133
Raja!

1352
01:38:04,217 --> 01:38:05,508
Does not that sound like the voice of my father?

1353
01:38:05,592 --> 01:38:07,717
- Your father is here.
- Do not tell him I'm here.

1354
01:38:07,758 --> 01:38:10,342
Hey, Sweet Bunny. My dear Bunny.

1355
01:38:10,425 --> 01:38:13,258
- How are you, uncle? - Are you here. Sweet Bunny.

1356
01:38:13,342 --> 01:38:16,883
I begged him not to
call me Sweet bunny ?!

1357
01:38:17,092 --> 01:38:18,342
Where is Raj, honey?

1358
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:19,800
It's here.

1359
01:38:20,842 --> 01:38:21,675
Hello.

1360
01:38:21,758 --> 01:38:25,967
Did not I tell you that
they will both be here?

1361
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:27,675
Dear.

1362
01:38:28,008 --> 01:38:31,133
When you bring her
home as my daughter?

1363
01:38:31,342 --> 01:38:33,883
Only you think I
should marry him.

1364
01:38:34,175 --> 01:38:36,675
He keeps his feelings to himself.

1365
01:38:36,842 --> 01:38:41,300
Men younger than me for a
long time grandfather.

1366
01:38:41,508 --> 01:38:43,008
When I, too, they'll be?

1367
01:38:43,092 --> 01:38:45,800
Why do you always get
me with this question?

1368
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:47,883
Go do something useful.

1369
01:38:47,967 --> 01:38:50,342
You have all the time you do not want to talk about it!

1370
01:38:52,383 --> 01:38:53,342
Wait.

1371
01:38:53,758 --> 01:38:56,008
- Aunt ?! - I did nothing.

1372
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:17,717
Son, stand and sit back.

1373
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:19,383
Please, have a seat here.

1374
01:39:19,717 --> 01:39:22,050
Uncle, come back.

1375
01:39:22,258 --> 01:39:26,008
I have to share with you
something important.

1376
01:39:27,675 --> 01:39:30,925
Do you not understand the hint?
Sit behind us.

1377
01:39:31,175 --> 01:39:34,592
I wonder why they
are glued to it?

1378
01:39:35,383 --> 01:39:37,717
- Who the hell is this guy?
- How do I know?

1379
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,383
When I asked him to give way to the...

1380
01:39:39,467 --> 01:39:41,425
... Dharma told me to sit back.

1381
01:39:41,758 --> 01:39:46,342
It is more important than me?
I need to know who he is.

1382
01:39:46,425 --> 01:39:49,175
Hey, come here. He certainly knows.

1383
01:39:49,467 --> 01:39:51,550
Who is this man in a plaid shirt?

1384
01:39:51,633 --> 01:39:56,258
He Madras. A friend of Aunt Vanati.

1385
01:39:57,092 --> 01:40:00,008
It has already become his in this family.

1386
01:40:01,925 --> 01:40:03,717
Ritual feeding of the crows.

1387
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,300
Let me do it.

1388
01:40:06,342 --> 01:40:08,258
Where are you going?

1389
01:40:09,758 --> 01:40:11,800
Go out and feed it crows.

1390
01:40:15,008 --> 01:40:16,883
It's late. Lets go faster.

1391
01:40:17,133 --> 01:40:19,092
Why do not you listen?

1392
01:40:21,717 --> 01:40:24,050
You yourself, as a crow.
Why do not you eat it all?

1393
01:40:25,383 --> 01:40:27,675
Hammer appears, your business card.

1394
01:40:33,967 --> 01:40:35,758
Go faster.

1395
01:40:40,883 --> 01:40:43,383
Ravens sit on the terrace and eat it!

1396
01:40:43,717 --> 01:40:45,300
Do not shout, crows spugnete.

1397
01:40:46,633 --> 01:40:47,508
Hey!

1398
01:40:47,592 --> 01:40:50,842
Exams, it does not bake a cake.
There is nothing to fear.

1399
01:40:50,925 --> 01:40:55,717
There's a hundred pages, there's a
couple of lecture notes, that's all.

1400
01:40:57,883 --> 01:40:59,633
Vremelёt, what are you doing?

1401
01:40:59,717 --> 01:41:02,383
Izvini.U I had wet hands.
I thought it was a towel.

1402
01:41:02,925 --> 01:41:04,967
How he dares to flirt with
her, holding her half sari?

1403
01:41:05,133 --> 01:41:06,592
Where is unfortunate, my son?

1404
01:41:06,675 --> 01:41:08,467
Course unfortunate, it is the same as you!

1405
01:41:08,550 --> 01:41:09,967
I will beat you. Go talk to him.

1406
01:41:10,050 --> 01:41:12,383
- Do not humiliate me. - Come on. Go.

1407
01:41:14,883 --> 01:41:15,967
Sorry.

1408
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:21,508
What is the profession of our son?

1409
01:41:21,592 --> 01:41:22,758
Dr.

1410
01:41:23,050 --> 01:41:25,175
Who is the bride of our son?

1411
01:41:25,258 --> 01:41:27,383
The daughter of my brother, Vanati.

1412
01:41:27,467 --> 01:41:29,758
If someone violates this alliance...

1413
01:41:29,842 --> 01:41:31,217
You made him a chutney?

1414
01:41:32,425 --> 01:41:34,300
Let it be clear.

1415
01:41:34,675 --> 01:41:36,550
That he understood.

1416
01:41:36,633 --> 01:41:38,300
- How was my voice? - Stupid, as always!

1417
01:41:43,258 --> 01:41:47,008
My ears from them withered.

1418
01:41:47,675 --> 01:41:50,592
Why do they share with me
your personal belongings?

1419
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:56,258
Kali!

1420
01:42:09,883 --> 01:42:12,675
These brothers tied to it...

1421
01:42:12,758 --> 01:42:16,008
It looks like it will be in their house in-law!

1422
01:42:18,300 --> 01:42:21,675
Brother, it seems, we can not do
justice to our guest as we would like!

1423
01:42:21,925 --> 01:42:23,383
Do not worry, Cali.

1424
01:42:23,467 --> 01:42:25,633
Around too many relatives.

1425
01:42:25,967 --> 01:42:27,842
That's why we could not
show him our true love.

1426
01:42:28,550 --> 01:42:32,300
Soon they will leave.
Then do the trick.

1427
01:42:33,842 --> 01:42:35,050
Cali?

1428
01:42:35,425 --> 01:42:36,925
- Daughter in law? - Why are you two up?

1429
01:42:37,133 --> 01:42:38,592
Your father wants you
to spend guests.

1430
01:42:38,633 --> 01:42:40,092
- Get down. - We are now.

1431
01:42:44,133 --> 01:42:47,383
- The ritual is over, brother.
- Our guests will soon leave.

1432
01:42:47,717 --> 01:42:49,550
We need to hold them.

1433
01:42:53,883 --> 01:42:55,717
Pay for flowers.

1434
01:42:56,342 --> 01:42:58,800
No one should leave.

1435
01:42:59,008 --> 01:43:00,550
Why are you here mumbling to himself?

1436
01:43:00,633 --> 01:43:01,592
Relatives should not leave.

1437
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:02,758
What?

1438
01:43:02,842 --> 01:43:06,800
Why do people go so early.
After all, they did not even rest?

1439
01:43:06,925 --> 01:43:09,592
If they leave, it will be sad.

1440
01:43:09,675 --> 01:43:12,633
True, but because they have to leave?

1441
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,758
All of them will come to the wedding Vanati and Raji.

1442
01:43:15,842 --> 01:43:16,967
When is it?

1443
01:43:17,050 --> 01:43:19,717
You're so worried for them?

1444
01:43:19,800 --> 01:43:22,467
If they are ready, but at least today!

1445
01:43:22,550 --> 01:43:24,383
- Parvati? - I'm coming.

1446
01:43:31,967 --> 01:43:32,967
See you, uncle.

1447
01:43:33,050 --> 01:43:34,717
Sir, I'll go.

1448
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,092
It all depends on how
we will lead ourselves.

1449
01:43:41,217 --> 01:43:44,800
This guy is very quick.

1450
01:43:44,883 --> 01:43:46,383
I'll deal with it.

1451
01:43:51,842 --> 01:43:54,258
What do you want?

1452
01:43:54,342 --> 01:43:56,092
What should I ?!

1453
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:59,467
You do not have to rush.
There is enough food to eat.

1454
01:43:59,633 --> 01:44:01,717
Do you think that I am a glutton
who loves to eat for free?

1455
01:44:01,883 --> 01:44:05,092
What? You only drink water?

1456
01:44:05,175 --> 01:44:06,717
Do you know who he is?

1457
01:44:07,133 --> 01:44:10,133
You go with him hand in hand,
without even knowing who he is ?!

1458
01:44:10,217 --> 01:44:12,800
It soon will be a test Vanati.

1459
01:44:13,133 --> 01:44:16,925
It is in his robe like a seller
of tooth powder on the market.

1460
01:44:17,008 --> 01:44:19,592
He was not even offered a place
in the front row during the Puja.

1461
01:44:19,675 --> 01:44:21,842
You are an eyesore to me...

1462
01:44:21,925 --> 01:44:23,342
... Ever since I came here.

1463
01:44:23,425 --> 01:44:27,092
Even since our son and daughter
of her brother were kids...

1464
01:44:27,342 --> 01:44:30,592
... Was agreed to marry them.

1465
01:44:30,675 --> 01:44:33,175
It was all so long ago.

1466
01:44:33,217 --> 01:44:34,800
And now you are looking at it ?!

1467
01:44:34,883 --> 01:44:40,425
If you prefer Vanati engineer doctor,
tell me what you'll do then?

1468
01:44:40,508 --> 01:44:42,383
Tell me, what do you do ?!

1469
01:44:42,592 --> 01:44:43,633
What is he saying?

1470
01:44:43,717 --> 01:44:45,842
I think he's an engineer!

1471
01:44:47,008 --> 01:44:48,758
Vanati studied in Madras.

1472
01:44:48,842 --> 01:44:51,842
If she lead guy out and
say, "He is my fiance '...

1473
01:44:51,925 --> 01:44:55,342
... Then what do you do?
Please tell me what you do.

1474
01:44:55,425 --> 01:44:56,550
I will act now.

1475
01:44:56,633 --> 01:45:00,383
I'll ask my brother-appoint
the wedding date!

1476
01:45:00,592 --> 01:45:03,883
He will say: a poor day,
new moon and so on.

1477
01:45:03,967 --> 01:45:06,925
I want to hear his excuses!

1478
01:45:07,133 --> 01:45:10,508
Yes you ever beat his head against the wall...

1479
01:45:10,675 --> 01:45:11,883
... It does not help.

1480
01:45:11,967 --> 01:45:13,550
I'll do it. Want to see?

1481
01:45:13,592 --> 01:45:15,133
Will you beat your head against the wall?

1482
01:45:18,633 --> 01:45:19,883
Hey, let's go.

1483
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:21,342
Try to wear this costume again!

1484
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:24,675
- We have to go. - I'll go, daughter.

1485
01:45:24,758 --> 01:45:26,175
Do not go .. No one should leave.

1486
01:45:26,217 --> 01:45:28,592
Brother, come inside.

1487
01:45:28,675 --> 01:45:29,717
Go inside.

1488
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:33,300
Please, all go back. Lakshmi.

1489
01:45:33,383 --> 01:45:33,883
- Go inside. - Father.

1490
01:45:33,967 --> 01:45:35,175
Why are you asking all to come back?

1491
01:45:35,258 --> 01:45:38,300
Today to conclude your Vanati engagement.

1492
01:45:38,508 --> 01:45:40,008
Why are you looking at me?

1493
01:45:40,133 --> 01:45:41,592
What's wrong with you, father?

1494
01:45:41,758 --> 01:45:43,133
He was just kidding. Please go.

1495
01:45:43,217 --> 01:45:44,800
- Go away, please. - Shut up.

1496
01:45:44,842 --> 01:45:46,592
Shut your mouth, and go inside.

1497
01:45:46,675 --> 01:45:48,425
Father, listen to me.

1498
01:45:48,508 --> 01:45:50,425
Let's, let's. Everything in the house.

1499
01:45:50,717 --> 01:45:53,133
Please go back to the house.

1500
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:55,758
I will decide once and for all.

1501
01:45:57,675 --> 01:46:01,008
Dirgadharishi why you
called again guests?

1502
01:46:01,425 --> 01:46:03,092
What's bothering you?

1503
01:46:03,175 --> 01:46:07,967
Are you going to give his daughter
in marriage to my son or not?

1504
01:46:08,175 --> 01:46:10,842
We have decided so, when
they were kids, right?

1505
01:46:11,092 --> 01:46:14,175
It's been a long time.

1506
01:46:14,383 --> 01:46:18,300
I want to announce their engagement today
with the blessings of our loved ones.

1507
01:46:18,383 --> 01:46:20,925
Uncle, why is it necessary
to do it now ?!

1508
01:46:21,008 --> 01:46:24,133
Dharma. We, the older,
themselves talk. You go.

1509
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:28,883
Why are you in a hurry, Dirgadharishi?

1510
01:46:28,967 --> 01:46:30,092
Is Why!

1511
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,842
Language  bit, or what?

1512
01:46:31,925 --> 01:46:33,633
Why do I have to talk alone?

1513
01:46:33,925 --> 01:46:35,508
Tell your brother that we think.

1514
01:46:35,675 --> 01:46:36,800
True, the daughter.

1515
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:38,883
If you do not enter into the engagement...

1516
01:46:38,967 --> 01:46:42,633
... So you have someone else in mind.

1517
01:46:42,717 --> 01:46:44,758
Nothing like that.

1518
01:46:44,842 --> 01:46:46,508
Then let it be now.

1519
01:46:46,592 --> 01:46:48,508
Why do not you agree?

1520
01:46:48,592 --> 01:46:52,383
It's only engagement.
Why not do it?

1521
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,175
Today is not too auspicious day.

1522
01:46:56,383 --> 01:46:58,050
"Did not I tell you?"

1523
01:46:58,258 --> 01:46:59,508
What a superstition!

1524
01:46:59,675 --> 01:47:01,967
For a man while he is alive,
every day auspicious!

1525
01:47:02,217 --> 01:47:03,675
Why put off the engagement?

1526
01:47:03,842 --> 01:47:07,383
Riyar Yes, good things do
not need to be postponed.

1527
01:47:08,342 --> 01:47:11,050
In any case, we should
not rush, Berry.

1528
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,717
Let's wait until the new moon.

1529
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:17,133
"Weddings will not be another day."

1530
01:47:17,258 --> 01:47:22,050
You're always looking for any excuses.

1531
01:47:22,342 --> 01:47:24,342
Do you intend to keep your word?

1532
01:47:24,467 --> 01:47:25,842
Or you want to have a ride?

1533
01:47:25,925 --> 01:47:29,508
I will not move from here until I hear back.

1534
01:47:38,217 --> 01:47:40,133
I never took it back.

1535
01:47:41,133 --> 01:47:43,175
Once you allow yourself to doubt...

1536
01:47:43,633 --> 01:47:45,300
... It does not matter
what I just said.

1537
01:47:46,217 --> 01:47:48,967
Let's fulfill the engagement
today as you wanted.

1538
01:47:49,883 --> 01:47:52,550
Your words are like a balm for the soul, to show.

1539
01:47:52,633 --> 01:47:54,967
Uncle, do not rush to appease my father.

1540
01:47:55,342 --> 01:47:56,967
Main your convenience.

1541
01:47:57,050 --> 01:48:01,383
We want you to marry,
and then prayed.

1542
01:48:01,467 --> 01:48:04,008
You can go to Kashi, Rameswaram,
or wander somewhere else.

1543
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:05,467
Just do not sin here.

1544
01:48:06,258 --> 01:48:07,508
O God!

1545
01:48:07,592 --> 01:48:09,842
Uncle, do not get me wrong.

1546
01:48:10,258 --> 01:48:12,800
I have never thought about
Vanati, as his wife.

1547
01:48:14,508 --> 01:48:18,342
In addition, I am not interested in this alliance.

1548
01:48:18,633 --> 01:48:19,842
Yes ?!

1549
01:48:20,092 --> 01:48:22,383
What is he saying? He is not quite all there?

1550
01:48:22,467 --> 01:48:24,092
Mom, you tell him to shut up?

1551
01:48:24,175 --> 01:48:25,300
Lost.

1552
01:48:26,550 --> 01:48:27,800
Congratulations, Uncle.

1553
01:48:27,883 --> 01:48:30,508
You had the courage to speak out.

1554
01:48:30,675 --> 01:48:31,592
Thank you.

1555
01:48:33,467 --> 01:48:36,092
Uncle, why? Do you like me?

1556
01:48:36,550 --> 01:48:38,217
No, not in this case...

1557
01:48:39,592 --> 01:48:41,508
- Tell me. - Lost!

1558
01:48:42,842 --> 01:48:43,925
No, it's...

1559
01:48:44,133 --> 01:48:45,883
If the groom refuses to
itself, what can we do?

1560
01:48:45,967 --> 01:48:47,383
Let's go.

1561
01:48:47,467 --> 01:48:48,842
Uncle?

1562
01:48:49,050 --> 01:48:51,217
Do not go away. Wait, stay.

1563
01:48:51,300 --> 01:48:52,717
One minute.

1564
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:53,550
Sir, wait.

1565
01:48:53,633 --> 01:48:55,133
Ms. bun! Please do not go away.

1566
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:57,217
- Wait. - Are you a relative?

1567
01:48:57,633 --> 01:48:58,383
Who are you?

1568
01:48:58,425 --> 01:49:00,467
You look like a goner,
suffering from malaria!

1569
01:49:00,633 --> 01:49:01,883
I do not need you. Get away.

1570
01:49:02,133 --> 01:49:04,633
Sir, what is wrong with Vanati?

1571
01:49:04,967 --> 01:49:07,133
It can be a model for the calendar
in the form of Goddess Mahalakshmi.

1572
01:49:07,217 --> 01:49:09,758
She's so beautiful.
How can he deny it?

1573
01:49:09,883 --> 01:49:12,342
Ask him.

1574
01:49:12,425 --> 01:49:14,467
Uncle, a new twist in the story.

1575
01:49:14,633 --> 01:49:15,800
My good fortune!

1576
01:49:15,967 --> 01:49:17,842
He's just trying to impress you.

1577
01:49:19,217 --> 01:49:20,633
Tell me what you do not
want to marry me, please.

1578
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:26,383
Why do none of you are talking about?

1579
01:49:26,717 --> 01:49:28,300
Your wife is here too?

1580
01:49:28,467 --> 01:49:31,592
- Come here, darling. - Be next to her!

1581
01:49:32,592 --> 01:49:35,717
Look at this couple, if the bucket
is stuck in a copper boiler.

1582
01:49:35,883 --> 01:49:39,342
If they can live happily
ever after, why you can not?

1583
01:49:39,758 --> 01:49:41,383
Sir, gray head!

1584
01:49:41,467 --> 01:49:43,300
What is standing like a statue?

1585
01:49:43,383 --> 01:49:44,967
Please, say something.

1586
01:49:46,300 --> 01:49:47,508
You will not talk.

1587
01:49:47,842 --> 01:49:49,383
Why are you silent?

1588
01:49:49,467 --> 01:49:51,300
Express your opinion.

1589
01:49:51,592 --> 01:49:53,800
You are their relatives and friends.

1590
01:49:53,883 --> 01:49:55,175
How can I convince them alone?

1591
01:49:55,258 --> 01:49:56,842
What say you, Madam?

1592
01:49:56,925 --> 01:49:58,342
Why do not you speak, sir?

1593
01:49:58,425 --> 01:49:59,342
Shakti!

1594
01:49:59,925 --> 01:50:01,425
Vanati silent. What is your problem?

1595
01:52:19,883 --> 01:52:23,258
As a child, she still
draws pictures!

1596
01:52:23,467 --> 01:52:24,675
How can I marry her?

1597
01:54:12,883 --> 01:54:15,925
Uncle, I'll marry Vanati.

1598
01:54:22,633 --> 01:54:25,508
We take for granted the
people close to us!

1599
01:54:25,925 --> 01:54:30,133
I learned more about it from your song...

1600
01:54:30,217 --> 01:54:33,092
... Although I know her since childhood.

1601
01:54:33,550 --> 01:54:34,800
So nice of you.

1602
01:54:35,383 --> 01:54:36,508
Thank you Shakti.

1603
01:54:36,883 --> 01:54:40,217
But for you, I would let go of this angel.

1604
01:54:41,133 --> 01:54:43,383
Now you son Diradharishi!

1605
01:54:43,467 --> 01:54:49,300
Instead of staring at
me, go hug daughter.

1606
01:54:51,258 --> 01:54:55,300
- A celebration worthy of kings.
- Come on.

1607
01:54:55,550 --> 01:54:57,925
Put it right. Bind up the rope.

1608
01:55:02,550 --> 01:55:05,675
Hamsaveni, quickly ends.

1609
01:55:06,258 --> 01:55:08,842
Hurry. None of the groom's relatives
had not yet arrived. Good?

1610
01:55:08,883 --> 01:55:11,008
I want to flower.

1611
01:55:14,258 --> 01:55:17,383
Vanati, pray at holy basil.

1612
01:55:17,883 --> 01:55:19,425
Let's go.

1613
01:55:31,258 --> 01:55:35,133
Take a blessing from
her father-in-law.

1614
01:55:36,133 --> 01:55:38,467
- Uncle, leaning a little bit! - What for?

1615
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:39,800
I want to tell you something.

1616
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:41,550
Ping!

1617
01:55:41,633 --> 01:55:44,050
Hey Ana! I squirted my uncle in the eye.

1618
01:55:44,133 --> 01:55:45,550
Let's go play.

1619
01:56:05,967 --> 01:56:08,008
I have been looking for you everywhere. Come on.

1620
01:56:08,217 --> 01:56:09,633
Where are you now?

1621
01:56:10,550 --> 01:56:11,758
I have spoken to a collector.

1622
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13,342
- Good. No need to worry about it.
- Brother.

1623
01:56:13,592 --> 01:56:14,467
One minute...

1624
01:56:16,175 --> 01:56:18,425
In one minute, please.

1625
01:56:18,508 --> 01:56:20,300
- I'll deal with it. - Yes sir.

1626
01:56:22,342 --> 01:56:23,967
Yes, Dirgadharishi?

1627
01:56:24,675 --> 01:56:26,633
Where did you dig up this treasure?

1628
01:56:26,925 --> 01:56:31,050
If not for him, the engagement
would not take place today.

1629
01:56:31,383 --> 01:56:34,842
Do you mean that he is
convinced your son?

1630
01:56:34,925 --> 01:56:36,300
Not only.

1631
01:56:36,425 --> 01:56:39,967
"Enclose engagement before all relatives"
he said.

1632
01:56:40,050 --> 01:56:43,050
"Father Vanati will be unlocked under the
pretext of unfavorable days and so on."

1633
01:56:43,133 --> 01:56:46,633
"But do not lose hope," he told me.

1634
01:56:49,258 --> 01:56:50,592
Do not go.

1635
01:56:51,008 --> 01:56:55,967
He said: "If not today, then
the wedding will never be."

1636
01:56:58,342 --> 01:56:59,758
I did not say.

1637
01:56:59,842 --> 01:57:02,800
Hey! Do not be shy. He is very modest.

1638
01:57:03,217 --> 01:57:05,550
A man like him...

1639
01:57:05,675 --> 01:57:10,175
... Win any obstacle your mind.

1640
01:57:10,258 --> 01:57:13,467
Every man should strive...

1641
01:57:13,550 --> 01:57:15,925
... Be as clever as he.

1642
01:57:17,008 --> 01:57:20,675
Digarharishi, engagement will take place is not here.

1643
01:57:22,133 --> 01:57:23,675
I change the venue.

1644
01:57:23,758 --> 01:57:25,300
Why?

1645
01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:29,592
Son of man who killed
my brother should die.

1646
01:57:30,967 --> 01:57:34,300
As long celebration will not
take place in my house.

1647
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:42,383
So they were married in the temple.

1648
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:46,175
Hey! Engagement is not here. It will take place in the temple.

1649
01:57:47,092 --> 01:57:50,050
The engagement will take place in the temple.

1650
01:57:50,133 --> 01:57:52,842
Take back the flowers and everything else.

1651
01:57:55,508 --> 01:57:57,425
All go to the temple.

1652
01:57:58,925 --> 01:58:01,092
You also have to go
beyond this house.

1653
01:58:15,508 --> 01:58:17,300
Hey, come here.

1654
01:58:26,342 --> 01:58:28,217
You have nothing to hide their
feelings behind a mask of a smile.

1655
01:58:28,758 --> 01:58:32,133
I know what's on your mind.

1656
01:58:32,675 --> 01:58:33,967
Do you know?

1657
01:58:34,883 --> 01:58:37,425
You could confess on the train.

1658
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:39,675
I myself realized this
only after I came here.

1659
01:58:40,008 --> 01:58:42,133
If my family finds out, it
will rise a lot of noise.

1660
01:58:42,508 --> 01:58:43,800
They already know.

1661
01:58:43,883 --> 01:58:45,217
What? That's bad luck.

1662
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:46,925
My dad can kill without hesitation.

1663
01:58:47,008 --> 01:58:48,758
This is exactly what I fear.

1664
01:58:48,842 --> 01:58:50,300
What are you going to do?

1665
01:58:50,633 --> 01:58:53,633
The only way quietly
sneak out of the house.

1666
01:58:54,258 --> 01:58:55,758
You have already decided so ?!

1667
01:58:55,842 --> 01:58:56,925
Yes.

1668
01:58:58,175 --> 01:58:59,383
- Then let's do it .. - Vanati?

1669
01:58:59,842 --> 01:59:01,133
Where is hell?

1670
01:59:01,675 --> 01:59:03,550
Somehow, come to the temple.

1671
01:59:04,133 --> 01:59:06,008
- There we will decide. Good? - Yes.

1672
01:59:07,300 --> 01:59:08,592
It's getting late. Time to go.

1673
01:59:08,675 --> 01:59:09,300
Hurry.

1674
01:59:09,383 --> 01:59:12,383
Meenakshi, ask our men to carry
the basket in the temple.

1675
01:59:12,758 --> 01:59:14,092
Good.

1676
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:23,133
What are you doing?

1677
01:59:23,883 --> 01:59:26,050
I just checked the flower baskets.

1678
01:59:26,133 --> 01:59:27,758
They are very large.

1679
01:59:27,842 --> 01:59:31,717
It is our family tradition
to present flowers to God.

1680
01:59:31,800 --> 01:59:32,883
You do not go to the temple?

1681
01:59:32,967 --> 01:59:33,800
- Gauri. - I'm going.

1682
01:59:33,883 --> 01:59:35,175
I go.

1683
01:59:35,258 --> 01:59:37,092
- Come soon. - Good.

1684
01:59:44,675 --> 01:59:45,800
Let's go.

1685
01:59:46,342 --> 01:59:47,883
Not out... Top.

1686
02:00:14,633 --> 02:00:15,758
What do you consider me?

1687
02:00:15,842 --> 02:00:18,342
Due to the fact that his father reveres
tradition ggstepriimstva, you're still alive.

1688
02:00:18,842 --> 02:00:21,717
I fear and respect only to his father.

1689
02:00:22,925 --> 02:00:24,925
What to customs and traditions,
I can close my eyes to it.

1690
02:00:34,050 --> 02:00:37,383
No one hears your cry, if
I kill you right here.

1691
02:00:37,758 --> 02:00:41,467
If my father asks me, I will
say that you killed outside.

1692
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:45,092
You did not expect this?

1693
02:00:45,467 --> 02:00:47,217
How many years we have searched for you?

1694
02:00:47,842 --> 02:00:51,217
The Soul of my uncle
now rest in peace.

1695
02:00:51,300 --> 02:00:52,925
Hey!

1696
02:00:57,717 --> 02:00:59,508
Hey!

1697
02:01:11,675 --> 02:01:14,550
Hey!

1698
02:01:18,050 --> 02:01:20,258
Open the door. Let me out.

1699
02:01:42,508 --> 02:01:45,092
Brother, I'm nowhere in the house can not find it.

1700
02:01:45,550 --> 02:01:48,050
It lies within the basket with flowers.

1701
02:01:48,133 --> 02:01:48,967
Razreshite--

1702
02:01:49,008 --> 02:01:51,925
His father killed my uncle.

1703
02:01:52,383 --> 02:01:53,967
I have to kill him with his own hands.

1704
02:01:54,467 --> 02:01:56,592
Take it along with all
the other baskets.

1705
02:01:57,508 --> 02:02:02,175
I chopped it into pieces.

1706
02:02:31,925 --> 02:02:35,050
Father, I will go to the temple the other way.

1707
02:03:05,842 --> 02:03:08,967
Uncle, I do not want to marry you.

1708
02:03:11,342 --> 02:03:12,508
It is Shakti?

1709
02:03:13,842 --> 02:03:15,925
I do not know what to say.

1710
02:03:16,008 --> 02:03:17,133
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1711
02:03:18,883 --> 02:03:22,217
Five minutes ago, I thought I
was the happiest man on earth.

1712
02:03:23,342 --> 02:03:26,008
In any case, only your
happiness matters to me.

1713
02:03:26,883 --> 02:03:28,175
And it is a good choice.

1714
02:03:29,383 --> 02:03:31,967
My father and brothers already know.

1715
02:03:32,133 --> 02:03:33,717
I'm afraid for Shakti.

1716
02:03:34,133 --> 02:03:35,467
I do not know what to do.

1717
02:03:35,675 --> 02:03:36,800
I'll talk to your father.

1718
02:03:37,175 --> 02:03:38,300
Come Meet the Shakti.

1719
02:03:38,925 --> 02:03:40,050
Go.

1720
02:03:41,467 --> 02:03:43,008
Just go.

1721
02:04:46,967 --> 02:04:48,383
There you are!

1722
02:04:49,175 --> 02:04:51,258
Uncle, you are also playing with us?

1723
02:04:51,342 --> 02:04:52,342
You are the first.

1724
02:04:52,425 --> 02:04:54,258
Pavie - second. Uncle - third.

1725
02:04:54,300 --> 02:04:55,925
Do not hide here.

1726
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:04,217
It is inside the house.

1727
02:05:10,592 --> 02:05:11,717
Ran.

1728
02:05:42,467 --> 02:05:44,175
Hey!

1729
02:07:42,925 --> 02:07:45,883
- Uncle? - What?

1730
02:07:47,342 --> 02:07:49,842
Vanati does not want to marry me.

1731
02:07:51,425 --> 02:07:53,217
I think she loves Shakti.

1732
02:07:56,133 --> 02:07:59,092
.. Uncle Uncle?

1733
02:08:11,717 --> 02:08:14,467
Hey, Mahari!

1734
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:30,508
- He ran there. - Find him.

1735
02:08:56,217 --> 02:08:57,842
Alag?

1736
02:09:28,550 --> 02:09:31,633
Shakti, is that you? I am your beloved bike.

1737
02:09:31,717 --> 02:09:34,258
What are you looking at?
If a person has the courage...

1738
02:09:34,342 --> 02:09:37,758
... Even a blade of grass is a weapon for him.

1739
02:09:37,800 --> 02:09:40,175
Sit down at me. Davie pedal.

1740
02:10:51,633 --> 02:10:53,342
Come on, it will run away.

1741
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:54,050
If you remove the board, no one
will be able to cross the bridge.

1742
02:12:54,467 --> 02:12:56,717
If you go in this direction, you
can reach the train station.

1743
02:12:57,050 --> 02:12:58,967
Faster Shakti.

1744
02:13:09,217 --> 02:13:10,342
Shakti!

1745
02:13:20,092 --> 02:13:22,425
Then I'll go by myself. You should not go.

1746
02:13:26,425 --> 02:13:30,467
Knowing that my dad killed your
uncle, you risked your life for me.

1747
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:33,800
It is now rare to find such a
good-hearted person like you.

1748
02:13:35,592 --> 02:13:39,258
I'm so afraid that your brothers and father will kill
me if I Molding over the threshold of the house.

1749
02:13:39,342 --> 02:13:41,050
That's why I played this comedy.

1750
02:13:43,633 --> 02:13:44,967
You can go back.

1751
02:13:48,258 --> 02:13:51,675
"The only way quietly
sneak out of the house."

1752
02:14:07,717 --> 02:14:09,508
Vanati one minute.

1753
02:14:10,258 --> 02:14:14,050
I do not know, see you again or not.

1754
02:14:14,342 --> 02:14:17,175
But I will never forget your help.

1755
02:14:17,258 --> 02:14:18,633
Thank you.

1756
02:14:19,842 --> 02:14:21,217
I wish a happy marriage.

1757
02:14:41,467 --> 02:14:42,842
Vanati your father here.

1758
02:14:42,925 --> 02:14:44,175
Go. I take care of myself.

1759
02:15:04,175 --> 02:15:07,883
Father, nothing with him do not do.

1760
02:15:09,633 --> 02:15:11,508
Brother, please, listen to me.

1761
02:15:11,842 --> 02:15:13,717
Brother, do not harm him.

1762
02:15:32,925 --> 02:15:36,467
Wait! Dad, are you
listening to me or not?

1763
02:15:37,050 --> 02:15:38,758
Do you know who he is?

1764
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:41,258
He is the son of the man who killed my brother.

1765
02:15:41,342 --> 02:15:42,717
So, Dad?

1766
02:15:44,300 --> 02:15:47,967
Do you want to kill an innocent person,
because his father killed your brother.

1767
02:15:48,175 --> 02:15:49,925
Is it fair?

1768
02:15:51,800 --> 02:15:56,008
He's innocent. Let it go, Dad.

1769
02:15:56,675 --> 02:15:58,967
Though you listen to me.

1770
02:15:59,050 --> 02:16:00,300
Otodvinsya aside.

1771
02:16:00,383 --> 02:16:02,633
- Throw him a sickle. - Come on, throw!

1772
02:16:02,717 --> 02:16:05,508
- No, do not .. - Come here.

1773
02:16:05,592 --> 02:16:08,092
Aim! Kill him.

1774
02:16:08,217 --> 02:16:09,758
Put a board.

1775
02:16:10,342 --> 02:16:12,925
Dad, please listen to me.

1776
02:16:13,008 --> 02:16:15,217
- Dad, ask them to stop.
- Let's put the board.

1777
02:16:16,508 --> 02:16:18,883
- Come on. Come on. - Brother.

1778
02:16:19,217 --> 02:16:20,217
Let another.

1779
02:16:21,050 --> 02:16:23,383
Brother, please, no.

1780
02:16:24,217 --> 02:16:26,300
Dad, please.

1781
02:16:27,300 --> 02:16:29,008
Leave him.

1782
02:16:30,217 --> 02:16:31,842
Bring another board.

1783
02:16:31,925 --> 02:16:33,717
We have no more boards.

1784
02:16:34,133 --> 02:16:36,133
- Find a board. - Bring it here.

1785
02:16:36,300 --> 02:16:38,550
I will not spare him.

1786
02:16:38,800 --> 02:16:41,175
You tried to run away with my daughter.

1787
02:16:41,258 --> 02:16:42,342
Do you think you will live a long time?

1788
02:16:42,758 --> 02:16:46,383
Dad, you're misunderstood.
He does not love me.

1789
02:16:46,758 --> 02:16:48,342
I love him alone.

1790
02:17:03,508 --> 02:17:05,175
Shakti, what are you doing?

1791
02:17:05,217 --> 02:17:10,258
Run away.

1792
02:17:10,883 --> 02:17:14,967
Please Shakti. Get out of here.

1793
02:17:55,383 --> 02:17:58,300
Until that moment I thought
I was alone in this world.

1794
02:17:59,758 --> 02:18:02,550
I thought only of saving, and fled in fear.

1795
02:18:03,175 --> 02:18:05,342
But now I know that
a girl like me.

1796
02:18:05,883 --> 02:18:10,050
She left for me family.

1797
02:18:10,342 --> 02:18:13,217
Why save his life, if it is
worth nothing without you...

1798
02:18:15,550 --> 02:18:19,383
Will I live or die,
I'm only with you.

1799
02:18:44,175 --> 02:18:46,633
How dare you hold a hand of my sister?

1800
02:18:48,050 --> 02:18:49,342
Shakti?

1801
02:18:52,383 --> 02:18:53,842
Please, Dad.

1802
02:18:54,008 --> 02:18:55,675
Let him go.

1803
02:18:55,758 --> 02:18:57,383
You dare to fall in love with my daughter ?!

1804
02:19:01,883 --> 02:19:03,633
Brother, just let him go.

1805
02:19:03,925 --> 02:19:05,175
Leave it.

1806
02:19:06,175 --> 02:19:07,383
Shakti!

1807
02:19:11,758 --> 02:19:13,508
No. Shakti.

1808
02:19:14,092 --> 02:19:15,717
Shakti.

1809
02:19:18,425 --> 02:19:20,925
Please, brother, do not hit him.

1810
02:19:33,883 --> 02:19:35,300
No, Dad.

1811
02:19:52,883 --> 02:19:54,342
Please, brother, do not hit him.

1812
02:20:05,592 --> 02:20:08,133
Please release him.

1813
02:20:08,175 --> 02:20:10,008
Please do not.

1814
02:20:13,800 --> 02:20:15,800
Dad!

1815
02:20:27,967 --> 02:20:30,758
Shakti, get up!

1816
02:20:40,467 --> 02:20:41,425
Shakti.

1817
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:49,925
Dad, do not do it. Please, Dad.

1818
02:20:54,425 --> 02:20:55,883
Let me go.

1819
02:20:58,092 --> 02:21:00,883
Dharma, cut his hand.

1820
02:21:30,550 --> 02:21:32,717
Vanati!

1821
02:21:32,842 --> 02:21:35,300
Vanati!

1822
02:21:35,467 --> 02:21:37,675
No!

1823
02:21:38,133 --> 02:21:39,550
- Vanati! - Vanati!

1824
02:21:41,842 --> 02:21:43,008
Vanati!

1825
02:21:44,342 --> 02:21:45,675
My daughter, Vanati!

1826
02:21:45,758 --> 02:21:46,883
Vanati!

1827
02:21:48,425 --> 02:21:50,800
- Vanati! - Vanati!

1828
02:22:08,342 --> 02:22:09,967
Vanati. Vanati.

1829
02:22:14,717 --> 02:22:15,758
Pope.

1830
02:22:16,592 --> 02:22:17,842
Vanati.

1831
02:22:28,925 --> 02:22:30,133
Vanati.

1832
02:22:33,175 --> 02:22:34,008
Vanati.

1833
02:22:34,133 --> 02:22:35,800
Vanati. Vanati.

1834
02:22:36,008 --> 02:22:38,592
- Vanati. Vanati. -Vanati.

1835
02:22:39,883 --> 02:22:41,842
- Vanati. - Vanati.

1836
02:22:42,258 --> 02:22:43,342
Vanati.

1837
02:22:44,842 --> 02:22:46,425
How could you do this, dear?

1838
02:22:47,092 --> 02:22:49,967
Your love stay at the top
of the bridge, Papa.

1839
02:22:50,717 --> 02:22:54,883
But his love was ready
to die with me.

1840
02:22:56,050 --> 02:23:02,050
If you still want to kill
him, then kill me with it.

1841
02:23:06,008 --> 02:23:07,383
I'm sorry, dear.

1842
02:23:25,675 --> 02:23:26,800
What?

1843
02:23:28,717 --> 02:23:29,883
Vremelёt!
