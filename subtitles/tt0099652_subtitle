1
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:28,454
After considering all
circumstances and statements...

2
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:32,261
this court considers accused
Ajay Mehra as guilty under...

3
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:36,224
l.P. Code 302 and sentences
him for life in prison.

4
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:58,266
He's been here for sometime but
doesn't talk with anybody.

5
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:01,514
His silence says a lot.

6
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,507
Was it some nightmare?

7
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,311
lt is reality.

8
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,315
We're familiar with that
reality, Ajay.

9
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:44,312
Our crimes are based on the
same reality you just described

10
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,293
He is Mitwa.

11
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:52,492
l found myself on footpath and
grew up hearing people's abuses

12
00:03:52,532 --> 00:04:01,304
Committed 13 murders in 20
years. What wrong did l do?

13
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:08,338
Vradha Rajan. l came from
Madras.

14
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:12,307
Carrying burden of humanity,
hard-work and honesty.

15
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:23,319
Bombay city took it and gave
pistol, gun and knife.

16
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:25,331
Rajan Berry.

17
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:32,293
Never thought hands that took
degree will rob or murder.

18
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,468
But l did that.

19
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:40,312
We too have complaints
with our life my friend.

20
00:04:40,513 --> 00:04:42,481
But we've to compromise.

21
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:48,351
Gradually these fingers will
learn to hold these iron rods.

22
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:57,422
These walls, roof and glassier
will make you forget the past...

23
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,331
which has brought you in
today's position.

24
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,435
How can l forget the past?

25
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:13,344
No. l can't forget...
Everything was so good...

26
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:20,369
''Darling...''

27
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,249
''l take your oath.''

28
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:34,352
''l don't want to live
Without you...''

29
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:40,454
Varsha, your home has come.

30
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:45,301
Today, l'll go to my home.
- What do you mean?

31
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:52,334
lt's clear. Girl's real home is
her beloved's home.

32
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,472
Sure, but after marriage.

33
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,440
When will we get married?
- Very soon.

34
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,444
l'm waiting for our country's
problems to be solved.

35
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:09,450
What about our children? Their
future? Their career?

36
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:13,454
You make a joke of everything.
Be serious sometimes.

37
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:19,335
You've everything - a brother,
Bhabhi [brother's wife].

38
00:12:19,338 --> 00:12:26,437
Me? l've become lonely after
mommy and daddy passed away.

39
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:31,340
You think l don't understand.

40
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,478
But my brother is very
short-tempered.

41
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:38,446
l'll take help of my Bhabhi -
l'll talk to her tomorrow.

42
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:43,451
You use delaying tactics.
l'm going to talk myself.

43
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,464
No Varsha, don't do that.

44
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:50,458
She needs beautiful, simple and
shy girl.

45
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:54,462
Beautiful, simple and shy...
That's what l am.

46
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,475
Yes, that's right.
- So, let's go and talk...

47
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:04,472
lt's not that easy, l need time
- l give you 24 hours.

48
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,485
What can l do in one day.
- 20 hours.

49
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,480
Okay, 24 hours are okay.
- 18 hours... 15 hours, 13...

50
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:27,472
No Bhabhi, l can't see you
working - let me help you.

51
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,474
What're you doing - leave it.

52
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:34,502
You work so much - you need
someone to share your work.

53
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:38,472
l've asked maid servant -
she'll start from tomorrow.

54
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:45,479
Not her. We need someone who
helps like a family member.

55
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:51,485
Do you understand?
- Yes. You love somebody.

56
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:56,490
You're afraid to say it to your
brother and l should say to him

57
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:01,495
Your brain is as beautiful as
your face. You're great Bhabhi.

58
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,374
l understand
How does she look?

59
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:08,504
Who?
- The girl.

60
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:12,473
She's beautiful, Bhabhi -
very beautiful.

61
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:16,477
Nothing in comparison to you.

62
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:23,485
But she is okay for helping you
l'm not asking her for myself.

63
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,498
l understand everything -
l'll talk with your brother.

64
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,502
Let us go Bhabhi.
- Now?.

65
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:35,405
Never postpone till tomorrow
what you can do today. Come.

66
00:14:35,441 --> 00:14:37,375
l said l'll talk!

67
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,472
So young lord is in love.

68
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,520
And he wants to marry.

69
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,495
You too recommend that.

70
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:03,490
Where is he now.
- He's here. Should l call him.

71
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:07,505
Call him lovingly.

72
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:13,500
Didn't come!

73
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:16,505
Did you call me brother?

74
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,519
l am told you've grown up.

75
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:35,222
Okay. You're in love -
and you want to get married.

76
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,293
No brother, Bhabhi wanted -

77
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:42,364
l mean Bhabhi was saying she
needs someone to help her.

78
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,344
l suggested maid servant's name
but she said maid won't work...

79
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:52,215
she wants from family and asked
me to get married.

80
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:55,379
She wants a daughter-in-law.
- Daughter-in-law?.

81
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:59,380
l said l enjoy my freedom...
- Well said...

82
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:02,258
But she doesn't agree.

83
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:07,221
l said how Laxman can do such a
thing without Ram's permission.

84
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:22,407
Mrs. Sita and Mr. Laxman -
stop your Ramayan.

85
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:25,247
Listen carefully to what l say.

86
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,411
What were you saying?
- About love, brother.

87
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,252
Remove the craze of love
from your mind.

88
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:34,385
You have to become a boxing
champion - win a gold medal.

89
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,394
You'll lose everything in the
craze of marriage.

90
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,261
You're scolding him as if he
has committed an offense.

91
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,390
What else is this?

92
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:44,266
What had you done?
- What had l done?

93
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:51,232
You used to tease me by blowing
horn in the mid of night.

94
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:56,270
ln the midnight! Waking whole
neighborhood! l come home early

95
00:16:56,281 --> 00:17:00,240
And because of this craze your
brother was arrested once.

96
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,257
You went to jail.
- She is lying.

97
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,259
Gupta uncle got him released.

98
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:17,361
And he said, what's in jail he
can even accept hanging for me.

99
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:28,370
Didn't l hang by marrying you?
l don't want him to do that.

100
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:33,340
l don't know anything. First a
daughter-in-law will come.

101
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,354
He'll become boxing champion.

102
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:52,260
First daughter-in-law...
- First boxing champion...

103
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,434
What's going on Ashok?

104
00:17:56,475 --> 00:18:00,275
Good, you've come.
Now you can decide.

105
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:04,373
First this is not court, it's
my niece's home...

106
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,443
And here, l'm not barrister
Gupta - l'm uncle Gupta.

107
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:10,353
How are you lndu?
- l'm okay.

108
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:14,359
How is your practice?

109
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:24,359
He is actively practicing -
not boxing, but in love!

110
00:18:24,403 --> 00:18:28,362
Like Mughal-e-Azam. And your
niece is supporting him.

111
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,375
What does it mean lndu?

112
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,505
My lord l request he may
be granted his love.

113
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:39,280
Because every successful man
has a support of a woman...

114
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,481
And that woman in Ajay's life
is his beloved.

115
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:48,460
She is right. l think we should
see the girl.

116
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:51,293
What are you saying uncle.

117
00:18:53,499 --> 00:18:58,266
Leave it uncle.
- But l'm talking in your favor

118
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,262
l'll sacrifice my love for
the dreams of my brother.

119
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:13,308
Oh Devdas - stop this drama.
- He's pretending.

120
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:18,381
We want to see the Menaka who's
melted my steel like brother.

121
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:23,383
So you are agreeing. Really.
- Yes. Really.

122
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:32,392
This boy is confused
- Also in hurry.

123
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:49,285
What happened?
Did brother and Bhabhi agree.

124
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:56,386
Same as in Mughal-e-Azam.
Brother became angry.

125
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,397
He roared like a cloud -
- l snapped like lightening.

126
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,490
Bhabhi poured like monsoon.

127
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,400
Brother took out the gun -
l bared my chest.

128
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:09,305
His gun...
my chest...

129
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:12,310
What happened next?

130
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:16,314
Bhabhi's tears.
Gupta uncle's wailing.

131
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:19,317
l said l'll give life but
won't break my promise to you.

132
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:26,314
Then what happened?
- Firing. Bullet went in roof.

133
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:33,287
You mean they agreed!

134
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,304
Do we go to cinema.

135
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:45,334
Be serious. Have you thought
about tomorrows match.

136
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,212
What's there to think about.

137
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,412
Match is with university
champion Tinu.

138
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,421
Tinu or anybody -
what difference it makes to me.

139
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,418
Shut up and listen to me.
- Yes sir.

140
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,420
You've been selected for
tournament - God knows why?

141
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:48,235
This is your order. And l too
will have to go with you.

142
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:16,325
How can l explain it to you.
What l'm going through.

143
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:21,328
After loss in business
everybody has deserted me.

144
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:26,242
Friends and relatives have
exposed their true face.

145
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,443
l'd not even dreamt that l'll
do this to repay my debts.

146
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:34,445
Don't know whether l can be
free from debts or not.

147
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:37,455
Why don't you explain clearly.
- What should l explain?

148
00:22:37,489 --> 00:22:39,457
What's going on with you?

149
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:42,460
You don't let go anything.
- Why shouldn't l.

150
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:45,361
lf you don't tell me, who
else will you tell.

151
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:52,235
What's the matter?
- Nothing.

152
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,238
What do you have in hand?

153
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:55,432
l've been selected for the
tournament.

154
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:57,442
l've to go to Bangalore for
training.

155
00:22:57,476 --> 00:23:00,445
Well done my champion.

156
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,448
Did you hear?
- l heard.

157
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:09,352
What did you hear. Our Ajay is
going to become champion.

158
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,515
Let's have an outing.
- l won't go.

159
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:18,485
How won't you go - we'll take
you forcibly.

160
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:23,490
Brother your Bhabhi is heavy.
- Hey, she's my wife.

161
00:23:53,398 --> 00:24:03,364
''Why to worry
We'll face whatever comes''

162
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:12,373
''Don't waste today for tomorrow
Today won't come tomorrow.''

163
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:53,453
l remember you too much Varsha.
Do you remember me.

164
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:57,457
You wrote only 9 letters in
response to my 10 letters.

165
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:03,466
Who're you afraid of Varsha?
Afraid of world! l'll...

166
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:19,355
l've been beaten outside ring
more than inside the ring.

167
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,378

00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:33,486

Go away, else l'll be killed.

Bombay only to meet you.

175
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:42,370
What if you have come from
Japan. l don't know her.

176
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,500

Don't talk loudly - everybody

183
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:47,293
That baldy is looking in our
direction.

184
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,499
And that fatty has stopped
eating.

185
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,237
Who are you calling baldy and
fatty - l don't understand.

186
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,203
Who called me baldy?
- No, we didn't call you baldy.

187
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,216
And who called me fatty?

188
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:05,519
No, she calls me fatty -
you're quite slim.

189
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:14,220
That couple looks so nice and
they are having romance.

We are talking about our own
old age. Do you want me beaten?

193
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:34,208
See he touched me. ls there no
decent person to save me.

194
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,380
He's bothering me and nobody
is there to stop him.

Who are you mister?

She said, she loves me.
- No, l don't love you at all.

207
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,252
Excuse me sir, this girl is
in anger.

208
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:50,250
This man is double my size -
please tell him you love me.

209
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:58,224
l don't love you.
Would you please let me pass.

210
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:06,266
Please tell him you love me.

211
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:10,236
Whatever he me do to you but
l don't love you.

212
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:30,267
She's just kidding, actually
she loves me very much.

213
00:34:55,293 --> 00:35:00,253
''You love me -
Don't say no''

214
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:41,421
Why are you in this condition?
- l'm perfectly alright.

215
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:46,392
How are you?
- l'm okay.

216
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,408
What's the matter brother?

217
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,413
l've come to say something
very important.

218
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:05,411
How is Bhabhi?
- She is fine. l want to say...

219
00:42:11,462 --> 00:42:13,430
What's the matter?

220
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:18,435
You go. l'll talk with you in

221
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:22,235
Where are you staying?
- Hotel Dreamland.

222
00:42:22,273 --> 00:42:24,434
Okay, we will have dinner
together.

223
00:42:37,454 --> 00:42:40,287
Sorry sir, but Mr. Ashok Mehra
checked out in the afternoon.

224
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:46,263
Checked out? l'm his brother -
did he leave any message?

225
00:42:50,267 --> 00:42:53,236
How can he go without leaving
any message.

226
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:56,330
Perhaps he'd some urgent work
and he had to leave suddenly.

227
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,238
He wanted to say something
very important.

228
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,401
He can phone you.

229
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,424
Phone for you from Bombay.

230
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:40,439
ls it Ajay? l'm Ashok.
- How are you brother?

231
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:44,477
l want to tell you something
very important.

232
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:47,321
Yes, go ahead.
- Are you listening Ajay.

233
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,451
l'm in great difficulty.
- Difficulty?

234
00:43:49,493 --> 00:43:56,456
What's the matter brother.
Please tell me.

235
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:16,283
He phoned from here.
- From Bombay.

236
00:44:16,286 --> 00:44:19,346
Yes. He wanted to say something
but line got disconnected.

237
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:27,453
He's in Bombay and he didn't
come home! Something serious.

238
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:36,462
Ajay, l'm very afraid. He has
been upset for some days.

239
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:41,467
He said he is doing certain
things against his will.

240
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:46,347
Why didn't you tell me before.

241
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:52,346
He didn't even tell me so that
we'll not be disturbed.

242
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:57,487
He was suffering alone...
- Don't worry. He'll come back.

243
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,462
Maybe he's gone out for some
important work.

244
00:44:59,496 --> 00:45:02,260
l'll find out - everything
will be alright.

245
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:06,258
We'll scold him so much he
won't forget.

246
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:09,363
He makes my Bhabhi weep so much

247
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:17,471
Do you have his number.

248
00:45:25,522 --> 00:45:28,286
Gupta uncle has left for Delhi
for 8-10 days.

249
00:45:30,327 --> 00:45:35,287
l've been with home for long
time. He's upset for sometime.

250
00:45:35,332 --> 00:45:40,395
l heard Ashok and Balwant Rai
started some business together.

251
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:44,465
l don't know much but he let me
go with 3 months salary.

252
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:47,470
As l said Rai is not an
ordinary man.

253
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:52,471
He helps people like Ashok and
forget. Still l'll remind him.

254
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:56,475
For next two months he is
extremely busy.

255
00:45:58,522 --> 00:45:59,489
Go on.

256
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:02,492
That day he was very disturbed.

257
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:08,487
Boss is after me. Permission
for procession is cancelled.

258
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:16,495
He was disturbed. He telephoned
after 2 days and on phone too...

259
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:21,409
How was the party?
- Did Bulaney come?

260
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:25,472
Yes, with his wife - wearing
red blouse, dropping scarf...

261
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:30,476
Bhosle too her with him.
And Rane was very jealous.

262
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:36,482
l've heard your story.
- l'm not telling story. l'm...

263
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:45,491
l came to file a report...
- That your brother is missing...

264
00:46:45,536 --> 00:46:51,497
File your report with Mr. Patil
of missing persons squad.

265
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:55,512
l've many other things to do.

266
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,247
l'm seeing your work inspector.

267
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:09,317
You're forgetting that you're
here for hearing us.

268
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:16,321
You've this job because of us.
ls this the way to talk with us

269
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:21,293
Sir, this is the boy who was in
the quarrel at the college.

270
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:24,501
He goes to college for creating
nuisance rather than studies.

271
00:48:04,248 --> 00:48:07,308
Remember this slap in your mind
and heart.

272
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:15,415
Use these tears to flush out
our country's dirt.

273
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:25,326
Such policemen should be shot
in the midst of the road.

274
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:31,330
lt's good idea.
- You think l'm joking.

275
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:37,336
Joke! No. l was thinking -
who would fire the shots.

276
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:41,442
l will. Kept me at police
station for two hours.

277
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:44,443
They had no manners and
no feeling of responsibility.

278
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:49,448
Such people will protect us!
We're very safe here.

279
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:56,456
Don't be angry. Could you find
anything from his place of work

280
00:48:56,466 --> 00:49:01,426
He was working with Balwant Rai
Trying to meet him for 3 days.

281
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:04,338
They say he's extremely busy.

282
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:10,335
Balwant Rai?
You can meet him tomorrow.

283
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:28,263
Seeing your love, respect and
welcome has made me emotional.

284
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:36,364
More than money and sympathy
these children need love.

285
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:44,337
l'm ashamed l've been unable to
give them that love and time.

286
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:48,249
What more can l say...

287
00:49:56,293 --> 00:50:04,257
l make a small contribution of
Rs.5 lakh to this organization.

288
00:50:18,281 --> 00:50:20,249
l've to meet him.
- Meet him in office tomorrow.

289
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:27,451
My name is Ajay, l want to talk
about my brother Ashok Mehra.

290
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:34,457
Ashok was working with us but...

291
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,433
for past few months we didn't
have any dealing with him.

292
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:47,265
Did you file report with police
- Yes, but...

293
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:53,279
Yes, l know. Our police are just

294
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:57,286
l'll talk to the commissioner
personally about this.

295
00:51:09,332 --> 00:51:16,295
Your stuff is not as good as
before. Customers are unhappy.

296
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:20,265
What is the matter?
- Nothing sir.

297
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:26,271
Sir, it'd be good to increase
supply of your stuff in Gujarati

298
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:29,308
What happened to Mushtak?
- Sent him underground sir.

299
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:34,382
What do you mean?
- Put him under 7 feet of earth!

300
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:42,388
Never talk loudly. l don't
like noise.

301
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,328
He's my elder brother Ashok
Mehra. He often came here.

302
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,421
No sir, he never came here.

303
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,335
Do you know him.
- No sir.

304
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,308
Will you offer me liquor?

305
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:38,303
Will you offer me liquor?
- You're talking with wrong man

306
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:40,316
Aren't you trying to find
someone.

307
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,320
l know him.
- You know him?

308
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:47,416
He's my brother.
- How much money do you have?

309
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,332
How do you know my brother?
- This is insufficient.

310
00:53:56,366 --> 00:53:59,335
l'll give you more, you tell
me where is my brother.

311
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:05,341
Come with me.

312
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:23,257
Have him fight with my boy.
- Go away. Don't crowd.

313
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,332
He is lion.
- He's grand lion.

314
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:33,234
lf your boy wins l'll
give 40 for 10.

315
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,331
lf my boy is defeated l'll
give 300 for 10.

316
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:46,349
Come on, get ready.
- What are you doing?

317
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:49,375
lt is a game.
- With me as a bet!

318
00:54:49,386 --> 00:54:53,345
Stop this game, else
- You won't get anything.

319
00:54:53,390 --> 00:55:00,455
Nothing by beating me...
You get money by beating him.

320
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:05,457
l won't fight at any cost.
- Not even for your brother.

321
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:12,441
l told you l'll give you more
money tomorrow.

322
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:18,436
Who has seen tomorrow.
Talk about today - right now.

323
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,453
As you like.

324
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:32,350
l know you will win.
You're a good boxer.

325
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:37,264
l know it. Ashok told me.

326
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:41,464
And l don't forget such things.

327
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:26,471
He was in difficulty. Those who
gave him loan were after him.

328
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:32,477
To save his life he joined us.

329
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,290
l mean he started
working with us.

330
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:40,285
But he used to work for
Mr. Balwant Rai.

331
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,463
We both worked for him.

332
00:56:53,309 --> 00:57:00,374
He paid Ashok's debt and
bought him.

333
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:07,414
And expanded his business in
the name of Ashok's company.

334
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:10,393
What kind of business?
- Business of death.

335
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,396
Drugs.

336
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:18,390
Balwant Rai is a big dealer
of illicit drugs.

337
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:22,303
He has lakhs of goods in and
around here.

338
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,306
What are you saying?

339
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,410
Your brother too was
afraid of the truth.

340
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:36,375
lt is too much. l want to get
out of this swamp.

341
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,389
Moreover, l've paid back
your debts.

342
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:48,488
You take my advice -
stop all this.

343
00:57:49,432 --> 00:57:57,396
Take my advice. Take vacation.
And give that box to Kamran.

344
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:03,401
Ask Kamran to burn all files
and papers.

345
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:06,415
Then he went out for some days.

346
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:09,441
He told me he is going
to meet his brother.

347
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:17,223
He came to meet me. But didn't
he meet you again?

348
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:23,324
Yes, he met. One day he
met me here again.

349
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,200
ln this place?
- Yes.

350
00:58:26,236 --> 00:58:31,264
There was no other place
to meet.

351
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,410
This was our world.

352
00:58:36,446 --> 00:58:39,415
We were the king of this place.

353
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:47,253
l remember clearly, l was
sitting here.

354
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:52,524
He was where you are sitting.

355
00:58:54,464 --> 00:59:01,267
You are talking nonsense.
All fingers are not alike.

356
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:05,430
You don't know Ajay - my
brother will definitely come.

357
00:59:06,342 --> 00:59:10,403
l have booked a call from here.

358
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:16,442
l'll tell him, son l'm in
great difficulty.

359
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:21,412
He'll come running after
hearing my difficulty.

360
00:59:21,457 --> 00:59:24,221
Your call is connected.

361
00:59:26,462 --> 00:59:36,428
My call is connected - l'll
tell him. He'll come soon.

362
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:46,247
l'm Ashok - calling from Bombay

363
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:54,247
Are you hearing. l want to talk
very important matter with you.

364
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,258
l'm in great difficulty...

365
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:05,229
Tell me where is that box.

366
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:10,228
No, those papers are proof of
your crimes.

367
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,436
The mask of decency will come
off your face soon.

368
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:38,459
lf Ashok has told about the bag
he would be dead by now.

369
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:46,365
lf he has not told, he would be
hanging between life and death.

370
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,434
Come on - take me there.
- Where?

371
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,445
To my brother.

372
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,448
Hey son of mosquito -
come over here.

373
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,450
Let's quietly run from here.
- Who is he?

374
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,453
He's the owner of this bar.

375
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:04,449
Balwant Rai's stooge.
He is quite dangerous man.

376
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,463
He was here that day.

377
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:13,367
Come down.
Now l'll answer your punch.

378
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:28,474
Nobody will intervene. Watch
him dying - wherever you are.

379
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:32,250
He's hot blooded -
l'll freeze him.

380
01:03:42,552 --> 01:03:47,353
Hooliganism in public place -
you aren't afraid of law.

381
01:03:47,356 --> 01:03:52,225
This is your law?. Show courage
and arrest Balwant like this.

382
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,422
He has kidnapped my brother.

383
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:58,196
Don't allege any big man -
do you have any proof?

384
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,498
They took that man who was the
proof - in your presence.

385
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:08,199
You'll get the proof - his dead
body. Then write your report.

386
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:12,203
You'll get official medal!
- Don't talk rude. Police does...

387
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:16,207
Does nothing. Throw away your
uniform.

388
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,413
And wear the collar of
Balwant Rai on your neck.

389
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:29,425
This is lawless place. Show
your manhood on poor and weak.

390
01:04:31,467 --> 01:04:35,426
Power of uniform. You can put
handcuff only these hands!

391
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:37,439
Not on Balwant Rai!

392
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:47,212
Move your tail. Kiss their feet
- they'll thrown bones to you.

393
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:55,224
You are doing good inspector -
you're doing very well.

394
01:04:55,258 --> 01:05:01,219
You'll get promotion and medals
Why are you running. Listen me.

395
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:47,231
Barrister Pramod Sharan Gupta -
who solves everybody's problems

396
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:51,337
who handles problems of big
companies, state and nation -

397
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,439
isn't aware of his own
family problems.

398
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:57,446
Ashok is missing and nobody
has told me.

399
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:01,450
You were in Delhi, l thought...
- What?

400
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:05,449
ls any case more important than
my kids. You could've phoned me

401
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,422
Uncle, Bhabhi told me but...

402
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:11,400
You didn't think it necessary -
because you've grown up.

403
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:19,273
And did you realize implication
of what you did last night?

404
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:24,440
lf l wasn't here, how could
she have bailed you out.

405
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:29,440
l've explained everything...
- lndu, bring some tea.

406
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:36,254
Why don't you believe me.
Balwant Rai is a big smuggler.

407
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:40,251
Brother is in his confines -
his life is in danger.

408
01:06:40,296 --> 01:06:42,264
We must do something quickly.

409
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:45,358
You're believing a drunkard you
don't even know.

410
01:06:45,401 --> 01:06:48,461
Whereas, Ashok is always
praising Balwant Rai.

411
01:06:48,504 --> 01:06:51,268
And he has helped Ashok
many times.

412
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:56,369
Help! That was a plan to trap
brother.

413
01:06:56,512 --> 01:06:59,379
Who are you talking about?
- No, nothing.

414
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:04,285
l'm no less anxious about Ashok
than you. He's like my son.

415
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,481
l'll leave no stone unturned
to find him.

416
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:11,391
But you don't complicate the
matter in haste or emotion.

417
01:07:11,494 --> 01:07:16,261
l've come. Everything will
be resolved. He'll come soon.

418
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:25,363
l've tried everybody. Nobody
helps in time of need.

419
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:30,277
Gupta uncle says, he has talked
with the commissioner.

420
01:07:30,312 --> 01:07:33,475
They are looking into the
matter. But no result.

421
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:37,308
l'm watching this game for
last one month.

422
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:40,482
Don't know brother's condition
or how much is he suffering.

423
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:49,295
Varsha, l hear his cries. He
needs me - l can't do anything...

424
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:59,263
l'll see Balwant Rai right now
and find out everything...

425
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:06,271
No Ajay. l don't know why but
l'm afraid.

426
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:10,274
l think it would be wrong to
go to Balwant Rai at this time.

427
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,288
You first talk with Gupta.

428
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:16,389
l don't need anybody. l'll do
whatever l must do.

429
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:28,302
Try to understand. Nothing will
happen to me. l'll be careful.

430
01:08:55,331 --> 01:09:00,291
Mr. Balwant Rai -
l've to talk with you.

431
01:09:00,336 --> 01:09:03,305
Talk with Mohile.
- l've to talk with you.

432
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:08,310
Come to office tomorrow.
- Not tomorrow - now.

433
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:18,252
Disturbing in party...
- Where is my brother?

434
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:22,213
Hasn't he returned. l'd asked
Mohile to call the Commissioner

435
01:09:22,258 --> 01:09:27,218
Before l expose you before
these respectful people...

436
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:29,390
Be descent and tell me where's
my brother.

437
01:09:31,433 --> 01:09:34,300
Send Hanif.

438
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,504
You've some misunderstanding.

439
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:50,515
l've seen the devil under your
high personality and cover.

440
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:56,518
No Ajay. You don't know me yet.

441
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:03,229
Those who clash with me, lose
their life very painfully.

442
01:10:03,265 --> 01:10:05,233
Give these empty threats to
someone else.

443
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:08,327
lf my brother is hurt l'll
punish you so bad that you'll

444
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:16,334
repent you were ever born. And
these dogs who encourage you...

445
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:20,304
to bark, won't be seen
anywhere near you.

446
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:43,328
lf my brother doesn't return by
tomorrow, l'll kill you.

447
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:47,331
Take away this drunken goon.

448
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,346
Run, police has come.

449
01:11:33,389 --> 01:11:36,358
What's going on.
Who were those people

450
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:44,264
They were that bastard's dogs.
- Behave. He's commissioner.

451
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:50,238
Be polite, you're talking to
the police commissioner.

452
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:52,240
What's the problem.

453
01:11:52,274 --> 01:11:57,234
My name is Ajay. My brother is
missing since last one month.

454
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:00,248
l filed a report with police -
but nothing has been done.

455
01:12:00,282 --> 01:12:05,276
When l found the person who has
kidnapped, yet the police are...

456
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:11,453
not ready to do anything. You
tell me sir, what should l do?

457
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,461
Who is that. What's his name?

458
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:15,463
Balwant Rai.

459
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:21,458
See, you're badly hurt -
- These wounds won't kill me...

460
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,472
You tell me - will you help?

461
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:30,274
l'll ask ACP Bhosle to
investigate thoroughly.

462
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:34,238
l've been seeing this drama of
investigation since one month.

463
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:38,344
My brother's life is in danger
- you say they'll investigate!

464
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:43,449
Police has to act under certain
rules and regulations.

465
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:47,451
We can't take action against
anybody without proof.

466
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:51,262
lf you like you meet ACP
Bhosle tomorrow.

467
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,471
This city is no longer
worth living.

468
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:12,420
After your brother comes, we'll
settle in some peaceful place.

469
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:17,381
l talked to Gupta uncle.
He has met the commissioner.

470
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:25,299
He assured your brother will
come soon. Don't worry too much

471
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:29,464
Then what should l do? Should
l sit doing nothing?

472
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:33,464
What has anybody lost?
My brother is missing.

473
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:38,469
Nobody will do anything.

474
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:44,475
This is a city of blind and
deaf. All are like stones.

475
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:56,487
l've been wandering like
crazy people since one month.

476
01:13:59,535 --> 01:14:02,504
Who knows he's alive or not?
- Ajay.

477
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:03,198
Sir, we've found papers Ashok
Mehra was hiding.

478
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:05,496
Should l put him underground.

479
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:40,429
Today l saw your anxiety to
meet your brother.

480
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:44,339
l appreciate your enthusiasm.

481
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:47,206
lf anything happens to my
brother l'll kill you.

482
01:15:47,242 --> 01:15:51,303
You can meet your brother in
Central Park.

483
01:15:51,346 --> 01:16:01,415
Show your enthusiasm to
reach your brother.

484
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:57,461
Balwant Rai -
you killed my brother.

485
01:17:57,506 --> 01:18:07,472
ls anybody hearing.
My brother has been killed.

486
01:18:16,491 --> 01:18:22,452
ls everybody dead?
My brother has been killed.

487
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:10,467
They killed my brother uncle.

488
01:19:10,512 --> 01:19:17,281
Where are you calling from?
- Central Park telephone booth.

489
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,289
Uncle they killed and threw
my brother.

490
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:24,292
What should l do uncle?

491
01:19:24,326 --> 01:19:26,487
Come quickly uncle.
- Yes, l'm coming.

492
01:20:33,261 --> 01:20:35,388
lndu, collect yourself.

493
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,234
Why have they arrested Ajay.

494
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:54,238
Admit you murdered your brother

495
01:20:55,250 --> 01:21:00,415
What are you doing Sharma?
Have you gone mad?

496
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:03,424
Do you want to kill him?
- Now he will admit.

497
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:10,220
Ajay they can do anything. Say
what they want. l'm with you.

498
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:15,225
l'll help you in the court -
you tell me.

499
01:21:20,275 --> 01:21:25,406
Go Bashir, join some drama
company

500
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:30,248
You'll earn a lot. Your acting
is very good.

501
01:21:31,386 --> 01:21:34,253
How about this acting.

502
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:43,356
Bribery and cunning have killed
effect of your mother's milk.

503
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:47,324
You are hollow and useless.

504
01:21:47,369 --> 01:21:56,277
l wish to... But now that will
solve your problem. Not mine.

505
01:21:56,278 --> 01:22:04,242
You've to die painfully within
the four walls of prison.

506
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:08,245
And l'll have you punished.

507
01:22:09,291 --> 01:22:17,255
You'll repent very much by
leaving me alive.

508
01:22:24,306 --> 01:22:28,265
Accused is wasting court's time

509
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:32,269
All proofs, witnesses and
investigative reports show that

510
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:36,239
accused has murdered
Ashok Mehra.

511
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:44,248
He's trying to put blame on
Balwant Rai to confuse the case

512
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:49,252
From this box he has insulted
the law and the court.

513
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:55,258
l'll bring an important witness
for whom we waited for 2 days.

514
01:22:55,303 --> 01:22:59,296
Specially, accused Ajay Mehra.

515
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:02,276
Permission granted.
- Present Pramod Sharan Gupta.

516
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:08,271
This name doesn't need any
introduction.

517
01:23:08,316 --> 01:23:11,285
Whose name is taken with great
respected in the world of law.

518
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:15,278
Who has taken law to new height
- who's created good examples.

519
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:20,421
Mr. Gupta, tell the Court what
you know about this case.

520
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:26,427
The victims wife is my niece -
l'm very close to this family.

521
01:23:27,302 --> 01:23:29,463
Ashok and Ajay used to fight
often.

522
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:34,407
But l'd never thought they will
result in murder.

523
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:37,378
When on 7 November l received
Ajay's phone saying...

524
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:40,279
he has murdered Ashok -
- What are you saying?

525
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:43,375
Then too l didn't believe him.

526
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:47,377
But when l reached there Ajay
was holding Ashok's body...

527
01:23:48,423 --> 01:23:52,291
My Lord, Ajay wanted that l
should hide his crime.

528
01:23:52,327 --> 01:23:54,488
He is lying!
He's talking nonsense.

529
01:24:00,301 --> 01:24:03,270
Why don't you understand -
Ajay is innocent.

530
01:24:03,304 --> 01:24:06,467
Whatever you want to say,
you can say from witness box.

531
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:17,477
What're you saying uncle?
Fear from God.

532
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:22,286
Don't believe his statement.
He is lying.

533
01:24:22,323 --> 01:24:25,292
l gave more importance to my
duty than relation or emotion.

534
01:24:25,326 --> 01:24:29,285
So l informed the police
- He is also been sold.

535
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:32,493
Balwant Rai has bought him too.
They are all together.

536
01:24:33,535 --> 01:24:38,404
Mr. Gupta, can you throw some
light on cause of this murder.

537
01:24:40,341 --> 01:24:44,505
l'm ashamed to say this.

538
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:51,418
But no husband can tolerate his
wife's affair with another man.

539
01:24:51,419 --> 01:24:54,388
Tell everything clearly
to the Court Mr. Gupta.

540
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:58,381
The accused Ajay had illicit
relation with his Bhabhi.

541
01:25:52,447 --> 01:25:55,416
l'll make you handicapped.

542
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:50,235
After considering all
circumstances and statements...

543
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:53,365
this court considers accused
Ajay Mehra as guilty under...

544
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:57,333
l.P. Code 302 and sentences
him for life in prison.

545
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:10,357
Oh God, she is a worst sinner.

546
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:13,327
She looks innocent, but...
- Husband's brother is like son

547
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:15,326
She's scar on the society.

548
01:27:15,363 --> 01:27:17,331
She should kill herself
by drowning.

549
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:22,336
She should be excommunicated.

550
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,429
She has no right to live in
the society.

551
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:36,442
She is not woman, but a witch.
She made brother murder brother

552
01:27:38,486 --> 01:27:47,451
Accused Ajay had illicit
relation with his Bhabhi.

553
01:28:47,388 --> 01:28:53,452
She left this letter for Ajay.

554
01:29:03,504 --> 01:29:10,501
Ajay l'm leaving you alone in
this cruel world in crucial time

555
01:29:10,511 --> 01:29:12,479
Forgive me.

556
01:29:12,513 --> 01:29:16,279
ln the next life, l want you
to be my son by birth.

557
01:29:16,317 --> 01:29:21,277
You must repay this debt.
May God save you.

558
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,408
We're with you Ajay.

559
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:52,208
We'll to fight this battle
with you.

560
01:30:52,246 --> 01:30:54,214
This is my battle.

561
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:55,408
You can't fight this battle
with sentiments.

562
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:57,418
You can't fight with
Balwant Rai alone.

563
01:30:57,452 --> 01:30:59,420
l'll fight alone.

564
01:31:00,455 --> 01:31:03,424
You call us your own and also
refuse to accept us as your own

565
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:07,417
lnstead of breaking stones in
jail it's better to help you.

566
01:31:07,428 --> 01:31:13,298
l can't endanger someone's life
for my own goal.

567
01:31:13,334 --> 01:31:18,328
What life and what danger -
We are already in under 302.

568
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:22,400
Can be hanged anytime. Better
run on first opportunity.

569
01:31:22,443 --> 01:31:28,279
Killing 2-4 like Balwant Rai
will wash away our sins.

570
01:31:28,316 --> 01:31:32,446
And then we'll settle in our
corners.

571
01:31:32,453 --> 01:31:37,288
Why don't you understand.
- Agree with us Ajay.

572
01:31:37,291 --> 01:31:41,421
We've been in this hell for
five years now.

573
01:31:42,296 --> 01:31:48,235
Good or bad, whatever we did,
we did it for ourselves.

574
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:53,229
Joining your battle might give
some meaning to our life.

575
01:31:54,275 --> 01:31:56,243
Don't be obstinate Ajay.

576
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,247
Shake hand friend.
- Yes.

577
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:23,431
Rain since last night has
closed the dirt road to jail.

578
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:25,462
Some jail vehicles have
been caught on that road.

579
01:32:25,473 --> 01:32:28,442
Warden has asked me to take a
few prisoners to clean road.

580
01:32:28,476 --> 01:32:30,444
l've given him name of
the four of us.

581
01:32:30,478 --> 01:32:33,447
They're getting ready to leave.
- Come Mitva.

582
01:32:49,463 --> 01:32:51,431
Move fast.

583
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:11,494
You watch New Bombay area.

584
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:14,508
You be in contact with Kwatre -
l need report from all areas.

585
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:19,468
You find more details. You
connect me to Traffic commish.

586
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:24,382
Three of them are professional
criminals with many cases

587
01:35:24,418 --> 01:35:29,287
Fourth was in for murdering
his brother.

588
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:32,492
They injured five guards
outside the jail.

589
01:35:32,526 --> 01:35:37,293
That means they would be armed.
- They snatched two guns.

590
01:35:39,333 --> 01:35:43,292
He's ACP D'Souza. l'm giving
this case in his charge.

591
01:35:43,337 --> 01:35:44,531
What's the latest information?

592
01:35:44,538 --> 01:35:47,405
They've gone towards Pokhran
jungle in Shaktiman truck.

593
01:35:47,441 --> 01:35:50,410
Jail has forwarded these
pictures.

594
01:35:50,444 --> 01:35:53,413
Any other details.
- No sir.

595
01:35:56,450 --> 01:36:00,511
My brother's life is in danger
you say you'll investigate.

596
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:10,395
As they've come so near to city
it's clear they'll try to enter

597
01:36:10,431 --> 01:36:13,400
We should try to catch them
outside the city.

598
01:36:32,253 --> 01:36:40,524
''l'm sweet, you come to me
Else l'm going.''

599
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:25,330
Are you blind? Can't you see?
What did you do? Broke my wall.

600
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:42,482
lf you love your life - you
should leave this place quickly

601
01:37:42,489 --> 01:37:47,222
ln a few minutes everything
will burn to ashes.

602
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:49,229
No one move from his place.

603
01:40:19,513 --> 01:40:25,281
Eat this.
- No. l'll die.

604
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:27,287
Balwant Rai's dog.

605
01:40:27,321 --> 01:40:32,281
Your this poison has taken
innumerable innocent lives.

606
01:40:32,526 --> 01:40:35,290
Destroyed innumerable families.

607
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:38,298
Eat this.
- No.

608
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:04,279
Balwant Rai.
- Who's that?

609
01:41:04,324 --> 01:41:11,287
l've spent each day like a year
behind the bars.

610
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:18,396
ln the next 24 hours, l'll cut
you in 24 piece...

611
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:24,307
and perform the last rites of
each piece separately.

612
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:27,404
You very well know consequence
of clashing with me.

613
01:41:27,448 --> 01:41:35,412
Your dockyard where you kept
your goods have burnt to ashes.

614
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:42,487
You'll also find dead bodies
of your stooges here in ashes.

615
01:41:43,530 --> 01:41:52,234
Don't worry - in 24 hours l'll
send you and others to them.

616
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:54,400
To the hell. l promise.

617
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:16,420
You don't worry.
We've made all arrangements.

618
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:20,228
They'll be caught soon.

619
01:42:20,367 --> 01:42:24,235
l'm making arrangement.

620
01:42:30,244 --> 01:42:33,407
They've threatened to kill
Mr. Rai within 24 hours.

621
01:42:33,447 --> 01:42:39,408
Mr. Rai?
- He is a very big businessman.

622
01:42:40,454 --> 01:42:47,223
Threat to kill Mr. Rai is like
challenging police department.

623
01:42:47,361 --> 01:42:50,228
What do these idiots think?

624
01:42:51,265 --> 01:42:55,326
They've not challenged Rai -
but the police.

625
01:42:55,469 --> 01:42:59,337
Rest assured sir, they'll be
caught very soon.

626
01:42:59,373 --> 01:43:04,504
24-hours maybe short time for
them but not for us.

627
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:10,472
l've full trust in you. Make
arrangement for Rai's security.

628
01:43:35,509 --> 01:43:47,478
An ordinary boy threatens at
midnight to kill me in 24-hours

629
01:43:58,398 --> 01:44:02,528
How does it look?
- We'll catch him. Our police...

630
01:44:02,536 --> 01:44:08,372
Shut up. Your police, your law
is like you.

631
01:44:10,277 --> 01:44:13,440
Put some of your people at
Gupta's house.

632
01:44:14,481 --> 01:44:17,473
Spread your net throughout the
city.

633
01:44:17,484 --> 01:44:19,349
Dig him out wherever he
may be hiding.

634
01:44:19,386 --> 01:44:24,449
lf you can't get him alive
bring his dead body.

635
01:44:54,388 --> 01:45:08,462
''Thirsty youth
And stormy night...''

636
01:50:23,316 --> 01:50:27,275
[The accused Ajay had illicit
relation with his Bhabhi.]

637
01:50:59,519 --> 01:51:02,488
See, where is Kamle. He goes
anywhere leaving the gate open.

638
01:51:50,437 --> 01:51:53,497
Wait a minute.

639
01:51:57,510 --> 01:52:02,470
Sir, where is Gupta.
- He's Gupta.

640
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:08,513
Sir, he gave 24-hour time -
Deka and Gupta went in 8 hours.

641
01:52:08,521 --> 01:52:11,490
ln the remaining 10 hours me
and you will...

642
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:17,329
He's ACP D'Souza. Pradhan has
given this case to him.

643
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:20,299
ACP D'Souza what's going on
in this city?

644
01:52:20,333 --> 01:52:23,496
Four murderers break the prison
and kill so many people.

645
01:52:23,536 --> 01:52:26,300
What's your police doing?

646
01:52:26,539 --> 01:52:32,307
Police is doing its job. Your
security is our priority.

647
01:52:32,345 --> 01:52:34,506
l hope you'll help us in
this matter.

648
01:53:08,248 --> 01:53:10,341
Sir, Pramod Sharan Gupta has
been murdered.

649
01:53:10,350 --> 01:53:13,217
What? When?
- Around 6:30

650
01:53:13,253 --> 01:53:16,416
We found other bodies bearing
foreign arms.

651
01:53:16,456 --> 01:53:18,424
They've not been identified.

652
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:21,222
l think it's doing of
those four.

653
01:53:24,264 --> 01:53:27,233
l feel there is another angle
to these murders.

654
01:53:27,267 --> 01:53:30,236
Pramod Sharan Gupta and
foreign arms.

655
01:53:30,236 --> 01:53:35,196
Give importance to their arrest
and security of Balwant Rai.

656
01:53:35,241 --> 01:53:40,201
When are you coming to office?
- l'm not coming today.

657
01:53:40,246 --> 01:53:44,444
l'm not too well.
- What happened.

658
01:53:44,450 --> 01:53:49,410
No. lt's not necessary for
you to come.

659
01:53:59,265 --> 01:54:02,428
Keep me informed on phone about
Balwant Rai's program.

660
01:54:08,274 --> 01:54:11,437
l tell you again -
don't play with the law.

661
01:54:11,477 --> 01:54:15,345
Law?. The law goes to bed with
bastards like Balwant Rai.

662
01:54:15,348 --> 01:54:19,341
Brokers like Gupta have sold it

663
01:54:19,385 --> 01:54:24,254
And the guardians of law like
you have enjoyed this show.

664
01:54:26,259 --> 01:54:29,319
l was going from pillar to post
for my brother in this city.

665
01:54:30,263 --> 01:54:32,231
Knocking at the door of law.

666
01:54:33,266 --> 01:54:36,235
l met you too. Remember?

667
01:54:36,269 --> 01:54:43,334
Remember rainy night when l was
begging for my brother's life.

668
01:54:45,378 --> 01:54:50,372
And one day Balwant Rai threw
my brothers body on the road.

669
01:54:50,383 --> 01:54:54,342
And your law punished me by
proving me his murderer.

670
01:55:02,495 --> 01:55:08,365
l wanted to ask something.
ls Ajay Mehra a good shot.

671
01:55:08,368 --> 01:55:09,426
Not really. Why?

672
01:55:09,469 --> 01:55:13,235
That means his bullet can go
left or right.

673
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:19,234
Because you are either left or
right of Balwant Rai.

674
01:58:32,338 --> 01:58:37,401
You'd have called me there, l'd
have come to Commish's house.

675
01:58:37,443 --> 01:58:43,439
Police is searching you every
place. Why did you come out?

676
01:58:43,449 --> 01:58:47,408
Why did you take the risk
of coming here.

677
01:58:47,453 --> 01:58:54,325
l came to meet brother and
Bhabhi. They are here.

678
01:58:54,360 --> 01:58:59,320
They are in everything here.

679
01:58:59,365 --> 01:59:03,324
How happy were we in this home?

680
01:59:04,437 --> 01:59:08,305
l understand your pain Ajay.

681
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:15,406
lt isn't pain Varsha -
it's fire.

682
01:59:15,448 --> 01:59:21,444
Rai who's responsible for this
ruin is still alive.

683
01:59:21,454 --> 01:59:25,322
But he won't see the sun
tomorrow.

684
01:59:25,458 --> 01:59:31,328
l'll kill him. Today.

685
01:59:31,364 --> 01:59:35,425
And, if something happened
to you?

686
01:59:36,469 --> 01:59:40,428
Have you ever thought about me?

687
01:59:41,374 --> 01:59:47,438
No Ajay. l don't want to
lose you again.

688
01:59:48,347 --> 01:59:52,249
What will you get from this
fight?

689
01:59:52,285 --> 01:59:55,254
Will all that come back?

690
01:59:55,288 --> 01:59:57,449
Will this become a home again?

691
01:59:57,456 --> 02:00:02,325
Varsha, it's not only about me
or this home.

692
02:00:02,361 --> 02:00:05,228
Who knows how many families
he has destroyed?

693
02:00:05,264 --> 02:00:07,323
How many innocent lives
he has taken?

694
02:00:09,268 --> 02:00:11,429
l agree this can't be the
same home again.

695
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:16,237
But many homes will be saved
from destruction.

696
02:00:23,382 --> 02:00:25,350
Mr. D'Souza has prohibited you
from going out.

697
02:00:28,387 --> 02:00:30,355
What's the sense of all this?

698
02:00:30,389 --> 02:00:35,452
Do you want me to hide for the
fear of that boy?

699
02:00:35,494 --> 02:00:40,454
That murderer Ajay Mehra would
be freely moving.

700
02:00:40,466 --> 02:00:44,232
And in the name of security
you've put me in house arrest.

701
02:00:44,270 --> 02:00:46,238
There is limit of stupidity.

702
02:00:46,372 --> 02:00:50,331
Listen, this meeting is
very important for me.

703
02:00:50,376 --> 02:00:52,435
lf you can't arrange my
security, l'll make my own.

704
02:00:52,478 --> 02:00:57,381
Barrister Gupta too made
his own security arrangement.

705
02:00:57,383 --> 02:01:01,251
With foreign arms.
You've seen its result.

706
02:01:01,287 --> 02:01:02,447
What do you want to say?

707
02:01:02,488 --> 02:01:07,255
Ajay Mehra's purpose in running
from jail is to kill you.

708
02:01:07,293 --> 02:01:13,357
Even now he must be trying
to reach you.

709
02:01:13,399 --> 02:01:16,459
He knows attacking you is like
committing suicide.

710
02:01:16,502 --> 02:01:23,465
Mr. Rai, the man who has lost
fear of death can do anything.

711
02:01:23,509 --> 02:01:34,477
Yet if going to meeting is so
important to risk your life...

712
02:01:50,503 --> 02:01:55,270
How are you now commissioner?
- l'm okay now.

713
02:01:55,308 --> 02:01:57,276
lt's not okay here.

714
02:01:59,412 --> 02:02:04,315
l don't understand security
arrangement you've done for me.

715
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:08,276
l've to go to an important
meeting but your Mr. D'Souza

716
02:02:08,321 --> 02:02:11,290
insists that l should go with
him in a taxi.

717
02:02:11,324 --> 02:02:13,383
And someone else
will go in my car.

718
02:02:13,426 --> 02:02:23,392
He wants to take me through
slums. What should l do?

719
02:02:23,402 --> 02:02:28,465
Mr. D'Souza is the only person
who can save you from death.

720
02:02:28,507 --> 02:02:32,273
Do whatever he says.

721
02:02:33,512 --> 02:02:35,480
Okay sir.

722
02:02:36,515 --> 02:02:39,484
Take care of him till we come.

723
02:03:57,430 --> 02:04:01,196
lt was your plan Mr. D'Souza.
See, what's happening.

724
02:04:01,233 --> 02:04:07,399
Go out and clear the traffic.
- Please, come back quickly.

725
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:19,350
Now what are you doing?
Sit quietly.

726
02:04:19,351 --> 02:04:23,219
l was closing window. 24-hour
notice has not yet ended.

727
02:04:23,255 --> 02:04:28,420
Will he attack you in bazaar.
- Not me sir, but you...

728
02:06:12,498 --> 02:06:15,467
You cover from behind.

729
02:06:19,471 --> 02:06:24,431
Listen Ajay, you go from here.
Go...

730
02:06:35,487 --> 02:06:38,456
Why did you shoot him. We could
have got him alive.

731
02:06:55,507 --> 02:07:01,468
ln broad day light, in bazaar.
This city isn't worth living.

732
02:07:01,480 --> 02:07:05,439
Arrange for me to go to London.

733
02:07:06,418 --> 02:07:10,377
l'm asking you Mohile.
What are you doing?

734
02:07:10,389 --> 02:07:13,358
l was closing the window -
so bullets won't come...

735
02:07:14,393 --> 02:07:20,263
l warned you. You all will meet
the same fate as your companion

736
02:07:20,299 --> 02:07:25,464
You are playing with death.
lt's not fight, it's suicide.

737
02:07:26,305 --> 02:07:30,469
This is my advice to you as
an elder, not as commissioner.

738
02:07:30,509 --> 02:07:36,470
Surrender while you still
have time. l'll help you.

739
02:07:36,515 --> 02:07:40,474
Take out sympathy from brain,
or l'll blow your brain out.

740
02:07:57,503 --> 02:08:02,463
Four prisoners absconding from
jail have created terror.

741
02:08:02,508 --> 02:08:07,468
One of the four prisoners was
killed in encounter with police

742
02:08:07,513 --> 02:08:11,506
Police has intensified their
effort to arrest them.

743
02:08:11,517 --> 02:08:15,476
Police posts have been set up
on all roads going out of city.

744
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:19,480
Police is also patrolling
all city areas.

745
02:08:19,525 --> 02:08:25,486
They have threatened to kill
Balwant Rai in 24 hours.

746
02:08:25,531 --> 02:08:28,398
While police is protecting
Mr. Balwant Rai...

747
02:08:28,434 --> 02:08:32,302
a prominent newspaper has
described him as a smuggler.

748
02:08:37,309 --> 02:08:39,470
l'm being called a smuggler.

749
02:08:39,511 --> 02:08:45,507
And that jail-breaker murderer
is fighting war of justice.

750
02:08:45,517 --> 02:08:49,385
Only God knows what'll
happen of this country.

751
02:08:49,421 --> 02:08:54,381
l don't want to live here one
more day. Where's London ticket

752
02:08:54,426 --> 02:08:58,385
What are you doing there?
- l'm locking this door...

753
02:08:58,430 --> 02:09:05,393
Do you think Ajay will walk in
and kill me in my home?

754
02:09:06,438 --> 02:09:13,401
Maybe he can. Our police are...
l'll see everybody...

755
02:09:13,545 --> 02:09:20,314
And l'll sue Varsha in court
for defamation. Won't leave her

756
02:09:21,353 --> 02:09:27,314
Leave it. Such a case might
prove harmful for your fame.

757
02:09:27,326 --> 02:09:33,492
Think about your life first.
You can sue if you're alive!

758
02:09:36,235 --> 02:09:47,203
Only you, me and your men knew
the route we were taking.

759
02:09:47,246 --> 02:09:51,512
Whereas Ajay was already
waiting for you there.

760
02:10:02,361 --> 02:10:06,229
Whole city is terror-stricken
and you publish this article!

761
02:10:06,265 --> 02:10:12,226
Ajay Mehra is a murderer and
cause of this bloodshed in city

762
02:10:12,237 --> 02:10:16,196
And you've made such vicious
man hero of your story.

763
02:10:16,241 --> 02:10:22,202
lt isn't story, it's real and
police is responsible for this.

764
02:10:22,247 --> 02:10:25,444
Which compels ordinary man to
become a criminal.

765
02:10:31,256 --> 02:10:34,225
What do you know about Ajay?

766
02:10:34,259 --> 02:10:37,228
Just that - he is a murder!

767
02:10:37,262 --> 02:10:39,389
He murdered his brother!

768
02:10:40,265 --> 02:10:45,225
Had illicit relation with
his Bhabhi!

769
02:10:55,447 --> 02:10:58,245
lt wasn't my intention to hurt
your feelings. l was...

770
02:10:58,283 --> 02:11:01,252
You wanted to know how l know...

771
02:11:03,288 --> 02:11:08,248
Not only l know Ajay,
l fully understand him.

772
02:11:08,260 --> 02:11:13,323
l went to seem him in jail
on 19 December.

773
02:11:13,365 --> 02:11:15,333
And l met him today.

774
02:11:15,367 --> 02:11:24,332
l didn't write this article in
emotion, but responsibly.

775
02:11:24,376 --> 02:11:29,336
l don't have personal enmity
with Ajay Mehra.

776
02:11:29,381 --> 02:11:33,477
ln a way l'll be helping him
by arresting.

777
02:11:33,485 --> 02:11:38,252
Because you too know the
consequence of path he is going

778
02:11:38,290 --> 02:11:44,456
lf you meet him again you
should ask him to surrender.

779
02:11:47,266 --> 02:11:50,235
He might obey you, because you
know and understand him.

780
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:05,273
Varsha, who wrote that article
is Ajay's beloved.

781
02:12:05,284 --> 02:12:09,345
She met him today. Don't know
why D'Souza left her.

782
02:12:14,293 --> 02:12:21,256
ldiot. You don't understand
this simple thing.

783
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:26,431
We can use the card thrown
by D'Souza.

784
02:12:26,438 --> 02:12:34,243
We needed exactly this card
to declare our game.

785
02:12:43,288 --> 02:12:48,248
l'm Joe D'Souza speaking.
- Yes, what's it?

786
02:12:48,293 --> 02:12:53,253
Police was chasing a car with
three persons in it.

787
02:12:53,298 --> 02:12:55,425
The car met an accident and
all three were killed.

788
02:12:56,268 --> 02:12:59,294
Police suspects, one of them
was Ajay Mehra.

789
02:13:10,515 --> 02:13:13,279
Trace the number she's dialing.

790
02:13:20,525 --> 02:13:24,291
She dialed commissioner's home.
- Commissioner!

791
02:13:43,315 --> 02:13:46,284
Can l talk to Ajay?

792
02:14:23,321 --> 02:14:27,382
Ask all nearby police stations
to surround commissioner's home

793
02:14:27,426 --> 02:14:30,395
l'm going there. There should
be no lapse of any kind.

794
02:14:30,429 --> 02:14:33,296
Nobody should fire.

795
02:14:33,331 --> 02:14:36,300
Still time to surrender.

796
02:14:55,353 --> 02:14:59,312
lf you think we're committing
a crime by killing Balwant Rai...

797
02:14:59,357 --> 02:15:06,229
then open the door after we
leave, else wait till sunset.

798
02:15:06,231 --> 02:15:13,399
We'll wait till sunset son.
Varsha told us everything.

799
02:15:14,439 --> 02:15:19,399
My and all mothers'
blessings are with you.

800
02:16:56,474 --> 02:16:59,443
Ajay you go. He's alright.

801
02:17:27,472 --> 02:17:31,431
Nothing will happen. l say
surrender or you'll be killed.

802
02:17:31,476 --> 02:17:37,346
You and all those who're with
Balwant Rai will be killed.

803
02:17:39,384 --> 02:17:45,254
No inspector, l'm not animal
like Balwant. l'm not murderer.

804
02:17:45,290 --> 02:17:49,249
l can't take anybody's life
without reason. l can't

805
02:17:49,294 --> 02:17:55,460
lf you've been wronged - l'll
get you justice.

806
02:17:55,500 --> 02:18:00,369
Your whole system is under his
foot - they're his slaves.

807
02:18:00,405 --> 02:18:03,374
Do you know whose life you're
guarding? What he is?

808
02:18:03,408 --> 02:18:07,367
Playing with people's lives
is his profession.

809
02:18:07,379 --> 02:18:13,375
You forget about me and use all
police force to save his life.

810
02:18:13,418 --> 02:18:16,387
But he won't survive -
l'll kill him.

811
02:18:19,391 --> 02:18:22,451
l'll kill him today.

812
02:18:45,517 --> 02:18:47,485
Be careful.

813
02:18:47,519 --> 02:19:09,500
Come Mr. Ajay.
We knew you'll come here.

814
02:19:09,507 --> 02:19:12,271
Varsha is in our custody.

815
02:19:12,310 --> 02:19:18,374
lt's a game.
Sometime you win, sometime we.

816
02:19:29,427 --> 02:19:36,299
l'd told you Sharma. lf you
leave me alive, you'll repent.

817
02:19:56,421 --> 02:19:59,390
Tell me where's Varsha?

818
02:21:53,471 --> 02:21:57,305
l've written everything about
Balwant Rai.

819
02:21:57,308 --> 02:22:03,269
But, you'll save me.
- Police is with you.

820
02:22:03,314 --> 02:22:09,253
l don't want to die inspector.
- Don't worry. Sign it.

821
02:22:10,255 --> 02:22:16,216
You've no shame. He gunned down
an officer, you couldn't arrest

822
02:22:16,261 --> 02:22:20,322
Now we should get special force
for our own security, isn't it?

823
02:22:20,365 --> 02:22:23,425
Today he killed inspector
Sharma and tomorrow...

824
02:22:23,468 --> 02:22:26,301
Don't call him inspector sir,
Sharma was a criminal.

825
02:22:30,475 --> 02:22:33,308
What do you want to say?

826
02:22:37,315 --> 02:22:43,311
Sir, this is the statement
of Balwant Rai's secretary.

827
02:22:43,321 --> 02:22:46,290
This is the record of their
illegal dealings.

828
02:22:49,494 --> 02:22:53,430
This is the ugly face of that
great personality.

829
02:22:53,431 --> 02:22:59,392
Our inspector Sharma was
working for Balwant Rai.

830
02:22:59,437 --> 02:23:05,342
And instead of arresting
we're trying to protect him.

831
02:23:05,343 --> 02:23:08,312
Why haven't police acted
against him sir.

832
02:23:19,490 --> 02:23:22,459
Truth is bitter.

833
02:23:23,394 --> 02:23:27,455
And it's also true that
l know everything.

834
02:23:28,499 --> 02:23:31,468
lt's not that l haven't tried.

835
02:23:32,303 --> 02:23:38,469
Whenever l tried, l'd to bow
before big powers.

836
02:23:39,477 --> 02:23:42,446
His reach is up to the top.

837
02:23:42,480 --> 02:23:48,476
Don't forget e aren't the whole
system - we're its small part.

838
02:23:48,486 --> 02:23:52,445
Our rights are just a facade.

839
02:23:53,391 --> 02:23:57,452
Nothing is in our control...

840
02:24:00,498 --> 02:24:05,265
That means Ajay Mehra is not
the culprit. We are!

841
02:24:05,303 --> 02:24:09,262
And our rotten legal system
is the culprit.

842
02:24:10,308 --> 02:24:13,471
Ajay Mehra is the outcome of
dysfunctional legal system.

843
02:24:14,512 --> 02:24:19,472
lf he had got the justice - all
this would not have happened.

844
02:24:20,518 --> 02:24:28,220
And we can't put an end to this
by capturing and killing Ajay.

845
02:24:28,426 --> 02:24:33,489
Whenever law murders justice -
a new Ajay will be borne.

846
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:40,267
Excuse me sir, but instead of
helping such law...

847
02:24:40,304 --> 02:24:43,330
l prefer to take off my uniform
and support Ajay.

848
02:24:43,374 --> 02:24:54,308
No D'Souza. This department
needs your kind of officers.

849
02:24:57,321 --> 02:25:03,385
And l'm grateful for awakening
my sleepy conscious.

850
02:25:04,429 --> 02:25:08,297
We'll act against Balwant Rai.

851
02:25:08,332 --> 02:25:12,496
We'll have him punished - but
according to the law.

852
02:25:12,537 --> 02:25:17,406
Before that we must stop Ajay
from committing another crime.

853
02:25:17,408 --> 02:25:23,472
l promise to do my best for
Ajay in the court.

854
02:25:25,383 --> 02:25:30,286
l don't know...
How many times will you ask?

855
02:25:33,424 --> 02:25:38,361
And if l knew, l would not
have told you.

856
02:25:38,396 --> 02:25:42,526
You love him too much.

857
02:25:43,434 --> 02:25:49,304
ln fact l was in search of
his special weakness.

858
02:25:50,341 --> 02:25:53,333
l've his most beautiful
weakness in my hands.

859
02:25:53,344 --> 02:25:57,280
Now l don't need to find him.

860
02:25:57,315 --> 02:26:01,308
He'll come on his own.

861
02:26:01,319 --> 02:26:09,283
Whether l reach him, or he
reaches me - result is the same

862
02:26:09,327 --> 02:26:12,296
His death.

863
02:26:23,307 --> 02:26:29,405
He'll come. He'll surely come.
And he'll bring such an storm...

864
02:26:29,447 --> 02:26:35,443
which will destroy your death
factory like a house of sand.

865
02:26:35,453 --> 02:26:45,419
You too know this. Because l
see fear of death in your eyes.

866
02:27:48,259 --> 02:27:52,320
Come out Balwant Rai. You enjoy
seeing others die.

867
02:27:52,363 --> 02:27:57,426
And you're hiding when your
death is standing before you.

868
02:30:14,505 --> 02:30:17,474
Stop there. Nobody will move.

869
02:30:36,327 --> 02:30:42,288
Leave my child.
- Move, else l'll shoot him.

870
02:30:42,333 --> 02:30:46,292
Ajay.
Come out.

871
02:30:46,337 --> 02:30:52,298
l'll shoot this child.
l'll shoot everybody.

872
02:30:52,309 --> 02:30:55,278
l'll count up to three.

873
