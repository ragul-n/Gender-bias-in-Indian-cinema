197
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:14,250

198
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,128

200
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,250

202
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,010

00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:41,175
Why will he kill himself? You guys cant solve
the case is it?

204
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:55,779
Today morning, my accountant told me

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,499
I gave him the cash at 7.30

208
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,140
why didn't you tell Sonia about this?

209
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,778
Sir, I tried to tell her but

210
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,893
she was in a shock, that's why i could not
talk to her

211
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,456
what kind of notes was it?

212
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,380
In thousands, it was a green colour PUMA
beg

213
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,052
We did not find such beg

214
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,136

00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:45,610
There were music system, lunch box and a
beg which was given by the accountant

217
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,616
Red colour right?

218
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,734
No sir, it was green in colour

219
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,980
What was in that beg? Did you open and see
it?

220
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,660
No sir, i will never open his beg without his
permission

221
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,695

222
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,820

223
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,209
Did Mr Kapoor tell anything about the beg?

224
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,898

Yes, 2 times

227
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:14,815
1 year back Mr Armaan did ask me to deliver
Rs 10 lakh to hotel Lido...

228
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,456
which is on the same road where his death

230
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:24,259

239
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,289
By right it should not

240
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:59,094
there are many evidence whithout the right
answer.

241
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,016
And today his wife filed F.I. R

242
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,579

285
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,849
You told me once that she entered our house

287
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,368
I can't believe, for money sake people can
act so weiredly

288
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,815
how if she is telling the truth?

289
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,377

290
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,378
How if she really have spoken to Karen?

291
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,452
Karen has past away, Roshini

292
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,974

293
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,656
but there are some people who can
communicate with souls

294
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,060
i have read in books

295
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,980

Roshini.

366
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,009

00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,813
its been few days he is missing

368
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,256
someone told me that he when back to his
village

369
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,455
Village means?

370
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:13,259
Village means where the cows are used as
cars that is a Village

371
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,656
you are a good comedian

372
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,577

374
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,655
first you take use to shashi's place

375
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,896
second choice straight to police station

376
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,936
one minute

377
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:40,059
on what reason will you arrest me?

378
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,176
Devraj, she is in deed a good comedian?

379
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,135
Im begining to find it funny now

380
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,498
Cristina, go up and get my diary

381
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,015
sir this is Devraj, shashi is not at his village

382
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,892
I knew, he will not be there

383
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,449
Its ok you should come back

384
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,569
and inform the police there to keep an eye
on his family

385
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,930
what ever it takes we must find this man
yes sir

386
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,254
sir, i need this medicen

387
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,811
Karen likes to play in water since a baby

388
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,096
I still remember

389
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,218
when i use to prepare the tub for his bath

390
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,533
he use to be so happy

391
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,019
he use to throw water on me from his mouth

392
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,049
and then he will giggle so much

393
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,172
he liked to stay in the water

394
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,739
was it nesecary he die drowning?

395
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,938
For parents to lost their child is the most
painfull thing ever

396
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,253
i can understand

397
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,250
sometimes in life this happens

398
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,899
The most precious people in our life are
taken away

399
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,570
but still we have to live ok

400
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,416
Be patient Roshini

401
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,291
i have full confident

402
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:36,860
with proper medication you will be able to
get out of this

403
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,170
after all you also have you husband's
support

404
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,056
at that moment, together with Karen I have
also lost Suri

405
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,779
the truth is accually Suri needs your help
more then me

406
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:54,577
what he is thinking or feeling

407
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:55,577
he never talks about it

408
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,770
he never spoke to me even regarding Karan

409
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,413
Never

410
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,569
Do you feel that he do not care about this
thing

411
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,213
he cares

412
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,537
if he did not he will be able to sleep at night

413
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,856

414
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:46,812

01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,820
why dont you ask me straight away sir?

729
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:22,940
I wont get offended

730
01:17:22,940 --> 01:17:24,214
this is my job

731
01:17:27,260 --> 01:17:28,613
i have never gone out with him

732
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:31,452
but one of his friend was my customer

733
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,975
and there was once Armaan Kapoor come
with him

734
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,179
Why you did not tell me this?

735
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:41,938
You never ask

736
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:43,974
when did you meet him?

737
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:45,820
3 years back

738
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:48,334
at that time he was not famous

739
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:53,689
Nikhal also brought one of his other friend

740
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:56,209
there was another man with him

741
01:17:57,660 --> 01:17:59,412
we when for a drive

742
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:03,416
that's all

743
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:06,780
the third man

744
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:10,409
was his name Sanjay Gigriwal?

745
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:13,050
I do not know his name

746
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:15,819
but once i look at him I will be able to
identify

747
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:41,892
why are you in this kind of life Rozy?

748
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,694
This place does not suit you

749
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:49,936
I was waiting for you

750
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,220
will you come here?

751
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,609
And take me away from here

752
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,220
If you want to be out just tell me

753
01:18:59,220 --> 01:19:01,654
I will right away take you out now

754
01:19:02,140 --> 01:19:06,099
I know that, but not this fast

755
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:08,731
I still have some debts to pay

756
01:19:10,940 --> 01:19:11,656
can i clear it first?

757
01:19:15,740 --> 01:19:17,776
What else sir

758
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:21,170
maybe one day i can be help for you

759
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,616
I have to believe this sir

760
01:19:36,860 --> 01:19:39,169
you are not same like the other guys

761
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:41,094
from my judgement

762
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,059
your place belongs some way else

763
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:45,574
really?

764
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:51,053
You know, you care for others

765
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,452
and dont even take advantage of others

766
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:00,930
3 years back one of my friend

767
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,460
when out with some guys

768
01:20:03,460 --> 01:20:06,736
and she did not return

769
01:20:07,940 --> 01:20:10,090
nobody knows where she when

770
01:20:11,100 --> 01:20:12,533
is she still alive or dead

771
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,338
no one cares

772
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:19,018
something to think about right sir?

773
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:25,490
A girl goes missing any no one even bother
asking

774
01:20:26,980 --> 01:20:28,174
did you do a police report?

775
01:20:33,780 --> 01:20:36,214
What are you talking sir

776
01:20:37,060 --> 01:20:39,858
looks like i have to teach you the law

777
01:20:42,020 --> 01:20:44,409
Being a prostitute is against the law

778
01:20:45,820 --> 01:20:48,334
you cant even count people like us sir

779
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,014
when they dont event appear for others

780
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:53,651
how can they go missing

781
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,176

799
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:44,696

800
01:22:45,460 --> 01:22:47,178

i understand you anger, you have pain in
your heart

You better be quit

01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,098
if you really can talk to Karen

835
01:25:43,380 --> 01:25:45,769
then call him
i want to see him, where is he?

836
01:25:46,180 --> 01:25:47,295
I cant do that

837
01:25:47,460 --> 01:25:49,940
only those souls which are around in this
world

838
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:52,020
can transform into human

839
01:25:52,020 --> 01:25:55,330
but Karen had no probleam to travel from
this world to their

840
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:56,928
he went peacefully

841
01:25:57,060 --> 01:25:59,415
ya right he when peacefully

842
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,572
he died drowning in the age of 8 years old

843
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:03,577
how can that be peacefull

844
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:06,939
in this world there are alots kind of situation
that cant be explain

845
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,695
i did not choose this life

846
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:11,533
this life choose me

847
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:14,009

01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:26,060
lets go

853
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:28,893
those souls will get attracted to people like
us who are in pain

854
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:31,290
and they feels like we are also like them

855
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:33,130
let me go

856
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:40,497
you lied to me? You hide the truth

857
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:42,696
how can i tell you the truth! Are you even at
home!

858
01:26:43,180 --> 01:26:44,579
Dont change the topic Roshini

859
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:46,932
you really believe in this kind of things

860
01:26:47,420 --> 01:26:48,853
you are such an educated person

861
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:50,130

sense

864
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:57,210
i do not know who to believe

865
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:00,611
but i just know that she told me such things
that only Karen knew it

866
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:03,297

867
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:05,173
why dont you understand?

868
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:09,100
Karen wants to talk to you!

869
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:10,328
You have become crazy

870
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:11,860
you need treatment

871
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:13,930
i do not need any treatment but need to talk
to you

872
01:27:14,260 --> 01:27:15,932

Can you once stay 1 night with me?

874
01:27:19,180 --> 01:27:23,776

875
01:27:24,700 --> 01:27:25,769

You also stay whole night out from your
family?

879
01:27:34,020 --> 01:27:35,976
Is your wife happy with this?

880
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:41,297
Where do you go Suri?

881
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:42,849
Have i ever ask you before?

882
01:27:43,700 --> 01:27:46,453
Who are you with at nights?

883
01:27:46,900 --> 01:27:49,255
I know you are not doing your work

884
01:27:49,820 --> 01:27:51,970
I know you are meeting someone else

885
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,820
but where every you go, what every you do

886
01:27:58,820 --> 01:28:02,256

That Gigriwal did not want to go to prison

1199
02:00:12,740 --> 02:00:16,619
Armaan Kapoor accident is a unsolve case

02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:21,209

1203
02:00:24,420 --> 02:00:26,650
and this will be your statement

1204
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:27,650
am i clear?

1205
02:00:29,660 --> 02:00:31,378

Surjan listen you need to curve yourself

1212
02:01:10,460 --> 02:01:11,688

1213
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:14,175
they get attracted with people like us

1214
02:01:14,660 --> 02:01:16,457

1215
02:01:17,540 --> 02:01:19,610

1216
02:01:21,140 --> 02:01:23,210

1344
02:20:37,446 --> 02:20:38,845
Even Ramu felt it weired

1345
02:20:39,086 --> 02:20:40,963
becouse Armaan dont like driving car
himself

1346
02:20:41,566 --> 02:20:43,557
What time did he go out from Film City?

1347
02:20:43,726 --> 02:20:44,522
At 2.20am

1348

Sipleas Road?

02:20:52,806 --> 02:20:54,478
At night, it will take about half an hour

1351
02:20:55,486 --> 02:20:57,716

1458
02:31:58,206 --> 02:32:01,721
Sonia, we still do not know where your
husband when on that night

1459
02:32:02,086 --> 02:32:04,281
or what was he doing on that road

1460
02:32:04,486 --> 02:32:06,078
and accident?

1461
02:32:06,926 --> 02:32:12,876
And we also can't understand why his car
turn and fall into the ocean

1462
02:32:15,966 --> 02:32:19,754
Madam Sonia, forgive me for asking

1463
02:32:20,686 --> 02:32:21,482
Yes

1464
02:32:21,566 --> 02:32:24,876
Was there any thing bothering him?

1465
02:32:27,286 --> 02:32:29,356
I meant was he having probleams

1466
02:32:31,486 --> 02:32:33,636
Armaan did not kill himself Inspector!

1467
02:32:34,966 --> 02:32:39,801
Why will he kill himself? You guys cant solve
the case is it?

1468
02:32:51,766 --> 02:32:54,405
Today morning, my accountant told me

1469
02:32:54,926 --> 02:33:02,002
on that day he past Armaan Rs20 lakh cash

1470
02:33:02,086 --> 02:33:05,044
Why?

1471
02:33:05,166 --> 02:33:09,125
I gave him the cash at 7.30

1472
02:33:09,566 --> 02:33:12,766
why didn't you tell Sonia about this?

1473
02:33:12,766 --> 02:33:14,404
Sir, I tried to tell her but

1474
02:33:14,846 --> 02:33:17,519
she was in a shock, that's why i could not
talk to her

1475
02:33:19,966 --> 02:33:22,082
what kind of notes was it?

1476
02:33:22,446 --> 02:33:27,006
In thousands, it was a green colour PUMA
beg

1477
02:33:27,006 --> 02:33:28,678
We did not find such beg

1478
02:33:29,806 --> 02:33:31,762

1480
02:33:35,726 --> 02:33:44,236
There were music system, lunch box and a
beg which was given by the accountant

1481
02:33:44,446 --> 02:33:45,242
Red colour right?

1482
02:33:46,166 --> 02:33:47,360
No sir, it was green in colour

1483
02:33:47,766 --> 02:33:49,606
What was in that beg? Did you open and see
it?

1484
02:33:49,606 --> 02:33:53,286
No sir, i will never open his beg without his
permission

1485
02:33:53,286 --> 02:33:54,321
Really?

1486
02:33:55,246 --> 02:33:56,446
Really sir

1487
02:33:56,446 --> 02:33:58,835
Did Mr Kapoor tell anything about the beg?

1488
02:33:58,966 --> 02:34:00,524
No sir

1489
02:34:00,766 --> 02:34:02,085

1490
02:34:04,726 --> 02:34:05,522
Yes, 2 times

1491
02:34:05,966 --> 02:34:13,441
1 year back Mr Armaan did ask me to deliver
Rs 10 lakh to hotel Lido...

1492
02:34:14,126 --> 02:34:16,082
which is on the same road where his death
tragic happen.

1493
02:34:16,326 --> 02:34:17,441
Why?

1494
02:34:17,686 --> 02:34:22,885
I do not know sir, I was just told to past it to
the receptionist.

1495
02:34:26,446 --> 02:34:28,641
You had a worker by the name of Anand
Murugen

1496
02:34:30,326 --> 02:34:31,964

02:34:42,126 --> 02:34:43,275
Its extotion case

1500
02:34:43,486 --> 02:34:47,684
if it's extotion im sure he would have talk to
somebody

1501

02:34:51,166 --> 02:34:53,396
got blackmail any relevance to his death

1503
02:34:53,766 --> 02:34:54,915
By right it should not

1504
02:34:55,286 --> 02:34:57,720
there are many evidence whithout the right
answer.

1505
02:34:58,526 --> 02:35:00,642
And today his wife filed F.I. R

1506
02:35:01,726 --> 02:35:03,205

Hero's case

How if she really have spoken to Karen?

1555
02:38:28,086 --> 02:38:31,078

02:46:06,126 --> 02:46:07,081
Village means?

1634
02:46:07,926 --> 02:46:11,885
Village means where the cows are used as
cars that is a Village

1635
02:46:14,166 --> 02:46:16,282

1636
02:46:16,846 --> 02:46:21,203

1638
02:46:26,326 --> 02:46:27,281
first you take use to shashi's place

1639
02:46:30,486 --> 02:46:32,522
second choice straight to police station

1640
02:46:33,686 --> 02:46:34,562
one minute

1641
02:46:35,966 --> 02:46:38,685
on what reason will you arrest me?

1642
02:46:42,686 --> 02:46:44,802
Devraj, she is in deed a good comedian?

1643
02:46:46,566 --> 02:46:48,761
Im begining to find it funny now

1644
02:46:56,246 --> 02:46:59,124
Cristina, go up and get my diary

1645
02:47:13,366 --> 02:47:15,641
sir this is Devraj, shashi is not at his village

1646
02:47:16,766 --> 02:47:18,518
I knew, he will not be there

1647
02:47:19,006 --> 02:47:20,075
Its ok you should come back

1648
02:47:20,886 --> 02:47:23,195
and inform the police there to keep an eye
on his family

1649
02:47:23,486 --> 02:47:25,556
what ever it takes we must find this man
yes sir

1650
02:47:27,606 --> 02:47:28,880
sir, i need this medicen

1651
02:47:31,286 --> 02:47:34,437
Karen likes to play in water since a baby

1652
02:47:35,046 --> 02:47:39,722
I still remember

1653
02:47:39,886 --> 02:47:42,844
when i use to prepare the tub for his bath

1654
02:47:43,646 --> 02:47:45,159
he use to be so happy

1655
02:47:46,166 --> 02:47:47,645
he use to throw water on me from his mouth

1656
02:47:48,126 --> 02:47:51,675
and then he will giggle so much

1657
02:47:59,126 --> 02:48:00,798
he liked to stay in the water

1658
02:48:03,326 --> 02:48:07,365
was it nesecary he die drowning?

1659
02:48:11,286 --> 02:48:15,564
For parents to lost their child is the most
painfull thing ever

1660
02:48:16,526 --> 02:48:17,879
i can understand

1661
02:48:18,126 --> 02:48:18,876
sometimes in life this happens

1662
02:48:20,566 --> 02:48:24,525
The most precious people in our life are
taken away

1663
02:48:24,966 --> 02:48:27,196
but still we have to live ok

1664
02:48:27,926 --> 02:48:30,042
Be patient Roshini

1665
02:48:30,326 --> 02:48:30,917
i have full confident

1666
02:48:31,206 --> 02:48:35,486
with proper medication you will be able to
get out of this

1667
02:48:35,486 --> 02:48:38,796
after all you also have you husband's
support

1668
02:48:40,086 --> 02:48:44,682
at that moment, together with Karen I have
also lost Suri

1669
02:48:45,526 --> 02:48:49,405
the truth is accually Suri needs your help
more then me

1670
02:48:50,166 --> 02:48:53,203
what he is thinking or feeling

1671
02:48:53,726 --> 02:48:54,203
he never talks about it

1672
02:48:55,926 --> 02:48:59,396
he never spoke to me even regarding Karan

1673
02:49:00,606 --> 02:49:02,039
Never

1674
02:49:04,646 --> 02:49:08,195
Do you feel that he do not care about this
thing

1675
02:49:10,326 --> 02:49:11,839
he cares

1676
02:49:14,806 --> 02:49:19,163
if he did not he will be able to sleep at night

1677
02:52:41,366 --> 02:52:43,482
sir the guy is Shashi's most important man

1678
02:52:43,846 --> 02:52:45,438

he is playing a big game

1711
02:54:45,486 --> 02:54:48,159
Shashi took Rs 20 lakh from Armaan Kapoor

1712
02:54:49,526 --> 02:54:50,845
he can't be saved now

1713

becouse police do not help people like us

1731
02:57:44,846 --> 02:57:46,199

03:25:09,566 --> 03:25:11,086
Rich guy

1991
03:25:11,086 --> 03:25:13,202
you meant Armaan Kapoor

1992
03:25:16,526 --> 03:25:19,446
why dont you ask me straight away sir?

1993
03:25:19,446 --> 03:25:21,566
I wont get offended

1994
03:25:21,566 --> 03:25:22,840
this is my job

1995
03:25:25,886 --> 03:25:27,239
i have never gone out with him

1996
03:25:28,326 --> 03:25:30,078
but one of his friend was my customer

1997
03:25:32,406 --> 03:25:34,601
and there was once Armaan Kapoor come
with him

1998
03:25:37,326 --> 03:25:38,805
Why you did not tell me this?

1999
03:25:38,926 --> 03:25:40,564
You never ask

2000
03:25:41,406 --> 03:25:42,600
when did you meet him?

2001
03:25:43,006 --> 03:25:44,446
3 years back

2002
03:25:44,446 --> 03:25:46,960
at that time he was not famous

2003
03:25:48,686 --> 03:25:52,315
Nikhal also brought one of his other friend

2004
03:25:53,686 --> 03:25:54,835
there was another man with him

2005
03:25:56,286 --> 03:25:58,038
we when for a drive

2006
03:25:58,766 --> 03:26:02,042
that's all

2007
03:26:03,806 --> 03:26:05,406
the third man

2008
03:26:05,406 --> 03:26:09,035
was his name Sanjay Gigriwal?

2009
03:26:09,606 --> 03:26:11,676
I do not know his name

2010
03:26:12,966 --> 03:26:14,445
but once i look at him I will be able to
identify

2011
03:26:38,766 --> 03:26:40,518
why are you in this kind of life Rozy?

2012
03:26:43,046 --> 03:26:44,320
This place does not suit you

2013
03:26:46,526 --> 03:26:48,562
I was waiting for you

2014
03:26:49,486 --> 03:26:50,846
will you come here?

2015
03:26:50,846 --> 03:26:53,235
And take me away from here

2016
03:26:56,446 --> 03:26:57,846
If you want to be out just tell me

2017
03:26:57,846 --> 03:27:00,280
I will right away take you out now

2018
03:27:00,766 --> 03:27:04,725
I know that, but not this fast

2019
03:27:05,446 --> 03:27:07,357
I still have some debts to pay

2020
03:27:09,566 --> 03:27:10,282
can i clear it first?

2021
03:27:14,366 --> 03:27:16,402
What else sir

2022
03:27:17,566 --> 03:27:19,796
maybe one day i can be help for you

2023
03:27:32,206 --> 03:27:34,242
I have to believe this sir

2024
03:27:35,486 --> 03:27:37,795
you are not same like the other guys

2025
03:27:38,446 --> 03:27:39,720
from my judgement

2026
03:27:40,206 --> 03:27:41,685
your place belongs some way else

2027
03:27:42,926 --> 03:27:44,200
really?

2028
03:27:47,006 --> 03:27:49,679
You know, you care for others

2029
03:27:50,326 --> 03:27:52,078
and dont even take advantage of others

2030
03:27:57,486 --> 03:27:59,556
3 years back one of my friend

2031
03:28:00,126 --> 03:28:02,086
when out with some guys

2032
03:28:02,086 --> 03:28:05,362
and she did not return

2033
03:28:06,566 --> 03:28:08,716
nobody knows where she when

2034
03:28:09,726 --> 03:28:11,159
is she still alive or dead

2035
03:28:12,326 --> 03:28:13,964
no one cares

2036
03:28:15,926 --> 03:28:17,644
something to think about right sir?

2037
03:28:18,166 --> 03:28:24,116
A girl goes missing any no one even bother
asking

2038
03:28:25,606 --> 03:28:26,800
did you do a police report?

2039
03:28:32,406 --> 03:28:34,840
What are you talking sir

2040
03:28:35,686 --> 03:28:38,484
looks like i have to teach you the law

2041
03:28:40,646 --> 03:28:43,035
Being a prostitute is against the law

2042
03:28:44,446 --> 03:28:46,960
you cant even count people like us sir

2043
03:28:48,366 --> 03:28:49,640
when they dont event appear for others

2044
03:28:50,446 --> 03:28:52,277
how can they go missing

2045
03:29:07,846 --> 03:29:09,802

i understand you anger, you have pain in
your heart

if you really can talk to Karen

2099
03:33:42,006 --> 03:33:44,395
then call him
i want to see him, where is he?

2100
03:33:44,806 --> 03:33:45,921
I cant do that

2101
03:33:46,086 --> 03:33:48,566
only those souls which are around in this
world

2102
03:33:48,566 --> 03:33:50,646
can transform into human

2103
03:33:50,646 --> 03:33:53,956
but Karen had no probleam to travel from
this world to their

2104
03:33:54,326 --> 03:33:55,554
he went peacefully

2105
03:33:55,686 --> 03:33:58,041
ya right he when peacefully

2106
03:33:58,446 --> 03:34:00,198
he died drowning in the age of 8 years old

2107
03:34:00,326 --> 03:34:02,203
how can that be peacefull

2108
03:34:02,926 --> 03:34:05,565
in this world there are alots kind of situation
that cant be explain

2109
03:34:05,966 --> 03:34:08,321
i did not choose this life

2110
03:34:08,726 --> 03:34:10,159

2111
03:34:11,486 --> 03:34:12,635

03:34:23,766 --> 03:34:24,686
lets go

2117
03:34:24,686 --> 03:34:27,519
those souls will get attracted to people like
us who are in pain

2118
03:34:27,846 --> 03:34:29,916
and they feels like we are also like them

2119
03:34:31,006 --> 03:34:31,756
let me go

2120
03:34:34,686 --> 03:34:39,123
you lied to me? You hide the truth

2121
03:34:39,206 --> 03:34:41,322
how can i tell you the truth! Are you even at
home!

2122
03:34:41,806 --> 03:34:43,205
Dont change the topic Roshini

2123
03:34:43,886 --> 03:34:45,558
you really believe in this kind of things

2124
03:34:46,046 --> 03:34:47,479

03:34:47,846 --> 03:34:48,756

how could you believe in all this kind of non
sense

2128
03:34:53,766 --> 03:34:55,836
i do not know who to believe

2129
03:34:56,086 --> 03:34:59,237
but i just know that she told me such things
that only Karen knew it

2130
03:35:00,126 --> 03:35:01,923
im happy doing this

2131
03:35:02,286 --> 03:35:03,799
why dont you understand?

2132
03:35:05,566 --> 03:35:07,726
Karen wants to talk to you!

2133
03:35:07,726 --> 03:35:08,954
You have become crazy

2134
03:35:09,086 --> 03:35:10,486
you need treatment

2135
03:35:10,486 --> 03:35:12,556
i do not need any treatment but need to talk
to you

2136
03:35:12,886 --> 03:35:14,558

2137
03:35:15,046 --> 03:35:16,957
Can you once stay 1 night with me?

2138
03:35:17,806 --> 03:35:22,402

You also stay whole night out from your
family?

2143
03:35:32,646 --> 03:35:34,602
Is your wife happy with this?

2144
03:35:38,126 --> 03:35:39,923
Where do you go Suri?

2145
03:35:40,406 --> 03:35:41,475
Have i ever ask you before?

2146
03:35:42,326 --> 03:35:45,079
Who are you with at nights?

2147
03:35:45,526 --> 03:35:47,881
I know you are not doing your work

2148
03:35:48,446 --> 03:35:50,596
I know you are meeting someone else

2149
03:35:55,166 --> 03:35:57,446
but where every you go, what every you do

2150
03:35:57,446 --> 03:36:00,882

2477
04:09:10,606 --> 04:09:12,801
they get attracted with people like us

2478
04:09:13,286 --> 04:09:15,083
