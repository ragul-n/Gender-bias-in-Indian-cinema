1
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,158
Thief!

2
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:51,870
Catch him!

3
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:53,438
Thief!

4
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:55,406
Hey you..stop!

5
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:57,865
Thief...

6
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,812
Oh God! Thou art the Giver of Life...

7
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,216
Thief..Thief...

8
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,819
Come on Ghanta!

9
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,233
Catch him..Thief...!

10
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:44,514
Come on Ghanta!

11
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:47,848
Thief...

12
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:18,913
Thief!

13
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:29,495
Hey...Stop...Witch..!

14
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:31,993
"Hey, come out!"

15
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:35,837
"You come in...Come on, Come on!"

16
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:48,844
Thief.. Thief..
- He has gone inside.

17
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,223
That's great! I hope the witch
turns him into a dog!

18
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,351
He pilfered from the temple
donation box.

19
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,430
Heretic! Sinner!

20
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,792
Madame Witch!
Madame Witch!

21
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,461
Please turn him into a donkey.

22
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,397
He has pinched too many
clothes from the riverbank

23
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,468
I say turn that crook into a hen.

24
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,278
It will be a pleasure to slice off
his head gently.

25
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,342
He's just a little child.
The poor thing is ignorant.

26
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,317
"Aha! Masterji!
So he's a little child, eh!"

27
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:24,081
Then why don't you go inside and
teach him a few lessons.

28
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,281
The witch too might get educated!

29
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,825
I don't believe in any
ghosts or witches.

30
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:35,023
And it is not mine but the
job of the police to catch

31
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,159
and send him to a Remand Home.

32
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:43,000
Ghanta... Masterji has a point

33
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,102
If the police don't catch
the thief then who will.

34
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:54,548
"No, No Mukhiyaji, that Spider Witch
does no discrimination between"

35
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,344
...cops and robbers.

36
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,450
No matter whoever goes in
comes out an animal.

37
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,293
And if you guys are so passionate
about catching the thief

38
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:05,364
then why doesn't someone accompany
us in? Say what Phuttan?

39
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,197
Punditji?

40
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,136
Say what Kallu! I heard he stole
six hens from your shop.

41
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:18,443
Come on will you.

42
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:25,814
Country peasants want to
take on the law.

43
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,045
Is there anyone with the
guts to go inside? Is there?

44
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,825
There is. I shall go in.

45
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,827
"Chunni, listen. I'll tell father.
- Shut up, you sissy pest!"

46
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:47,066
The witch is inside.
- Come on.

47
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:03,219
Come on it's nothing.

48
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:16,032
"What happened? It's nothing.
Come on, don't be scared."

49
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,386
Come out. Nobody will harm you.
We will let you go.

50
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:16,125
Come out. Don't be scared.
Come out.

51
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,778
No one dare enter

52
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,442
The Spider's web

53
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,121
For Shadows are hungry

54
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,385
In the Spider's web

55
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,797
Trapped in her cluches

56
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,292
trapped in her teeth

57
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,803
There is no escape

58
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:37,135
"Stay away, stay away."

59
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:17,840
The night sniffs fresh blood

60
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:25,348
As it wanders like a jackal

61
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,853
Webs hang from windows

62
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:36,865
Reeking of flies

63
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:42,270
The twisted feet of the witch.

64
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,832
Just who do you think you are!

65
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,834
"Madho, Munni has cooked the
eggs really well today."

66
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:27,183
"Grandma, Peas look like gourds to you
and gourd curry like egg curry."

67
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,351
"Really, ask Munni.
- Don't change the subject Chunni."

68
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,856
"Father, ask her why did she go
inside that Witch-house?"

69
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:43,235
Masterji told us the Science does not
believe in any ghosts or witches.

70
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:45,969
"So, where do you think
today's thief went?"

71
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:49,436
"And what about The Cobbler's daughter,
Phattu, Kallan eh?"

72
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:53,441
And don't they say that the witch
turned Tulsi's daughter into a hen!

73
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,541
"Madho, I suggest that we also keep
a hen in the house."

74
00:11:56,882 --> 00:12:01,319
The doctor told me that an egg a day
would be excellent for my eyesight.

75
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:06,824
Ugh! Why does the Buttermilk
taste like water?

76
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,220
Because this is water
not Buttermilk.

77
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:47,127
What happened Mugale Azam?
- I'm hungry.

78
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:51,528
Here.

79
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:57,865
My God! I haven't seen such huge
toffees in my whole life!

80
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:01,145
Don't you sweet talk with me.
Just eat.

81
00:13:02,815 --> 00:13:05,249
"So, why didn't you get
anything to eat today."

82
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,578
I couldn't wash the hencoop today.

83
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:11,813
"l don't feel like going even to
the loo so early in the morning,"

84
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:14,289
how does he expect me wash the coop!

85
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:18,487
Tell me this. Why did you make that
Butcher your father.

86
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,825
He adopted me when
I was still a little child.

87
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,160
"So you are grown up now, right!
Jump out of his shadow."

88
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:27,562
He wants not a son but a servant...

89
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,205
... who can wash his hencoops
all his life for free.

90
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,507
That's it. Enough.
- A little bit more.

91
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:39,244
"lf you want more, you'll have
to do something for me."

92
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,852
What?
- My homework!

93
00:14:00,806 --> 00:14:03,070
Where had you been?

94
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,466
Witch-house.

95
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,146
Tell me the truth or
I shall tell Father.

96
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:13,476
"Shut up, you sissy pest."

97
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:16,213
I shall make a hen out of you
and give it to Kallu.

98
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,980
Won't he love to chop
your head off

99
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:20,991
"Shak, shak, shak."

100
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,183
A razor makes a barber

101
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:55,125
And the knife a butcher

102
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,863
"The job, however, is simply to cut"

103
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,793
"And helpless is your brother.
What can be done?"

104
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,093
O what can be done?

105
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,804
"No one likes to die, sister"

106
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,800
No one likes to die

107
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:15,407
Dear Sister

108
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,337
My hens are so dear to me

109
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:54,114
And oh! So delicious

110
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:58,851
"They sway their red crowns
to the beat"

111
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:03,191
And rhythmically peck at grain

112
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:07,798
"Go on, get nice and fat"

113
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,500
"Eat away, my plump darling"

114
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,135
"Eat away, it gladdens my heart"

115
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:21,812
Eat away -- its good for my health

116
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:26,174
"But ah! no one likes to die, sister"

117
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:45,232
"Oh my dear, you are so gorgeous"

118
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,234
"And oh, so intelligent"

119
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:54,244
"And your lush feathers,
all yellow and blue"

120
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,305
so well groomed without oil and comb

121
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,113
"lts amazing how you settle on an egg,
and lo! behold, out comes a chick"

122
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,118
"Oh, my dear hen, you are sheer magic"

123
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,385
Gracious!

124
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,127
You are simply amazing

125
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,199
Pecking away at grain and laying eggs

126
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:23,066
"But no one likes to die,
dear sister!"

127
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:54,828
"Hurry up Chunni,
We're getting late for school."

128
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,437
"Hurry up, please.
- Coming."

129
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,889
Did you brush your teeth?

130
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,790
"At least try not to waste water,
Masterji tells us..."

131
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,459
That there are several countries
in the world where people don't

132
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,466
even get water to drink.

133
00:18:28,807 --> 00:18:30,798
Shut up you sissy pest.

134
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:41,508
Tata!

135
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:44,982
Money

136
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:53,426
Where is Munni?
- She got up so late. Still bathing.

137
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,825
"Listen, I am going to the
city for four days."

138
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:03,170
"l don't want any complaints
when I return, okay!"

139
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:08,109
"Okay. Father, what shall you
get for me from the city?"

140
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,109
A cane to hit you.
- Okay.

141
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,810
"Hi, Munni!"

142
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,340
"Father, Money."

143
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,482
Here. I am going to the city
to sell toys.

144
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,086
Take care of that little
witch while I'm gone.

145
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,183
Sure.

146
00:19:56,628 --> 00:19:58,596
Should I get something for
you from the city?

147
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:01,059
"Sure, a cane.
- What??"

148
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:06,569
An egg! A hen's egg...
for Grandma's eyesight.

149
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:11,166
All right. We shall keep a hen
in the house when I return. Go.

150
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,446
"Father, Money."

151
00:20:29,494 --> 00:20:30,483
Chunni!

152
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:35,600
"You have done the homework
yourself, right?"

153
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,864
Really Masterji. Swear on Munni.

154
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:44,200
Well done. Come on Munni Popatlal.

155
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,381
Excellent.
- Thank you Masterji.

156
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,043
You have to become a great
woman someday.

157
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:59,482
"Come on who's next.
Please come, Mr. Mugale Azam."

158
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,829
"What's this. Incomplete homework,
today as well."

159
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,839
I'm sure you have complete
meals everyday...

160
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,405
then why is your homework always
in complete.

161
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:25,508
If there is a problem then
please let me know.

162
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,515
Tell me Mugale Azam.
Why are you so quiet?

163
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:31,851
Why is your homework incomplete?

164
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:40,193
Go and squat like a rooster
in the corner. Go now.

165
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,530
Come on who's next.

166
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,271
School's over!

167
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,483
How...! Chunni!!

168
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,231
Hey Munni! Time for some fun.

169
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,168
What happened?
So you lost your money.

170
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:22,430
"Don't worry, have some from mine."

171
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,837
"No, No...Not this way."

172
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:29,377
There can be no gain
without some pain.

173
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,340
What?

174
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,251
I don't feel like doing my
homework today.

175
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,512
You shall achieve hell
for such sins.

176
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:42,224
I shall die of hunger but will never
abet you in your wrongdoings.

177
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:43,450
Never.

178
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:47,865
"Think about it carefully.
It's your decision, really."

179
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,033
"Chunni, shall I do your
homework today?"

180
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,872
"No, Munni shall do it. Only Munni."

181
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:03,808
Hey Aladdin. Come on.

182
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:21,822
"Here, have it."

183
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:26,133
"Hey, I gave the lce cream for you
to eat Mugale Azam..."

184
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,832
not for that dog.
- Aladdin is my brother.

185
00:23:29,107 --> 00:23:31,837
Just like Kallu had adopted me.
I've adopted this little one.

186
00:23:33,111 --> 00:23:36,842
"He is my best friend,
Aladdin's magical lamp."

187
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,431
"What are you thinking
about, Chunni?"

188
00:23:57,002 --> 00:24:02,133
Doesn't the Witch get bored sitting
all alone the whole day in the House?

189
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:09,543
Hmmm...I was wondering what does the
poor thing get to eat?

190
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:12,475
"Aw come on,
you don't even know this!"

191
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:18,481
She's got the biggest Pancake
in the world.

192
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:19,822
Shut up

193
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,826
"Come on, you. You don't
believe me right! Come."

194
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:28,330
"No, No, I am not coming!
- Think about it, fatso."

195
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:56,193
"Aladdin! Aladdin!
Don't go inside, Aladdin."

196
00:24:56,928 --> 00:25:01,797
"The witch inside. Aladdin, come back."

197
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,397
Go get my ball from inside Kallu.

198
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,465
"You are the hero of the village,
aren't you?"

199
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:12,070
Go get it yourself.
You scrawny lizard!

200
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:15,344
Why did you throw my ball inside?
Mugale Azam.

201
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:19,139
Hey...Scrawny Lizard!

202
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,148
Aladdin!

203
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,255
Don't Cry Mugale Azam.
He'll come back!

204
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,824
Aladdin! No...

205
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:33,089
Nobody has ever returned from there!

206
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:48,836
Where is the book?

207
00:25:49,848 --> 00:25:51,839
Where has she kept it?

208
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,789
What do you want Mugale Azam?
- Food!

209
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:10,124
"It's time to teach you a lesson, Kallu."

210
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:15,129
"Try dancing to this tune, Kallu."

211
00:26:15,807 --> 00:26:18,401
Now run behind your hens
through the village.

212
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,813
"Push harder, fatso.
- I'm pushing as hard as I can."

213
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:54,839
"Listen, hey loser, don't mess with me"

214
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,445
"Slap you so hard, don't mess with me"

215
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,784
Just don't mess with me

216
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:05,021
"Or I'll twist your little finger
till it swells like a thumb Get it?"

217
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:51,833
"I'm the one who turns
the wheels of the world"

218
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,229
"With my little schemes
I run the show"

219
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:59,441
"Believe me buddy,
I'm creme de la creme"

220
00:27:59,878 --> 00:28:04,178
"Come with me buddy,
and we'll rock the world"

221
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,783
But don't mess with me

222
00:28:10,822 --> 00:28:14,280
"Or I'll roll you and flatten you
like pizza dough, get it?"

223
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,808
"I'm for real, I'm a hoax, yeah.
I'm a con"

224
00:28:35,146 --> 00:28:38,809
"Here, eat my thumb,
I do as I please"

225
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,520
"Chunni now, and lo!
I'm Munni"

226
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,823
"And from Munni, back to Chunni"

227
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,936
"A little straight, a little twisted"

228
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:05,267
So don't mess with me

229
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:10,107
"Cause I can turn
a kitten into a goat"

230
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:53,985
"Chunni and Mugale Azam,
time for bloodshed!"

231
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,531
"ls this a joke, Munni?"

232
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,220
"l had done the homework, Masterji!"

233
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,152
"Now you too have started
lying to me, Munni!"

234
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:06,486
"No, Masterji.
I am telling the truth. God Promise."

235
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:18,173
Chunni. Chunni. When did the
war of Panipat begin?

236
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:20,166
What Masterji?

237
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,269
What was the kingdom
of Porus called?

238
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:26,841
The kingdom of Porus...
er...was...er

239
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,343
"So, now you have started
thieving as well, eh!"

240
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,183
No Masterji...I was

241
00:31:31,956 --> 00:31:34,186
Go and squat like a
rooster in the corner.

242
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:36,250
"l can't squat like a rooster,
Masterji!"

243
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,852
Why?
- Because I can squat like a hen.

244
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:45,199
"Shut up, you idiot.
Go in the corner."

245
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,870
Shut up.

246
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:55,502
School's over!

247
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:56,671
What!

248
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,492
You let my hens free in the
whole village.

249
00:32:16,834 --> 00:32:19,029
Want to mess with Kallu!

250
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:25,434
"Mugale Azam,
Where is Mugale Azam."

251
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:28,835
"Hey fatso, you saved my life.
Thank you."

252
00:32:30,581 --> 00:32:33,448
What's up! Why do you look like
a rotten pumpkin.

253
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:37,844
Hey Gotcha Chunni!
- Bye Uncle. God bless you.

254
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:43,189
"Now only God's blessings can
save you, Chunni Madam."

255
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,091
"But I am Munni, Uncle.
- Munni!"

256
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:49,461
"Chunni has gone towards that
garden road, that one, that"

257
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,458
"Hey, Mugale Azam!"

258
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:01,268
"Today in the science class, Masterji
taught us that in the world..."

259
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:05,806
"What happened?
- Munni, run. Run hard, Munni."

260
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:07,813
Oh my god!

261
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:19,059
"How far will you go, chunni?
I'll get hold of you."

262
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:42,181
"Father, that's Munni.
- But you are Mugale Azam, right?"

263
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,340
"Hey, gotcha...the witch,
the witch house."

264
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:07,308
Run for your life.
Go inside.

265
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,219
"Munni, don't go inside.
Come back Munni. Munni..."

266
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:21,320
If you come outside I shall
cut you to pieces.

267
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,301
You have lots of love for your
father's enemy.

268
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:38,832
Shall I cut you too!

269
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:51,183
Hey look at that!
There it goes.

270
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:58,492
Chunni!
- What happened!

271
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:02,265
What happened!

272
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,894
"Munni, Munni...Munni has gone
inside the Witch house."

273
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,367
What?

274
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:23,309
"Phuttan uncle, Phuttan uncle...
- What's up?"

275
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:31,485
"Phuttan Uncle, Munni has gone
inside the Witch house."

276
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,822
"But you can't fool me
this time, Chunni."

277
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:45,001
"Punditji, Munni has gone
inside the Witch-house."

278
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:50,845
Do something.
Please do something.

279
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:56,013
O Lord! Can you believe this liar?

280
00:35:59,524 --> 00:36:02,789
How can you expect this ailing
man to help you?

281
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,389
"Child, why don't you
go to the Police Station?"

282
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,460
You don't cry. You...
You don't worry.

283
00:36:10,801 --> 00:36:13,269
I am there for your right?

284
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:17,240
I shall go and fetch
Banta right now.

285
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:20,402
You go towards the Witch-house.
I shall come with Banta there

286
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,146
"And listen, no matter what happens,
you don't go inside...okay?"

287
00:37:59,543 --> 00:38:00,942
Munni!

288
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,401
"Who are you looking for,
little child?"

289
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:44,975
Have you seen my sister?

290
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:48,550
I have!

291
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,391
Munni?

292
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:12,841
She went into a slumber...
waiting for you all day.

293
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,973
She is beneath the red cloth.

294
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:23,213
"Munni, look who has come to
see you."

295
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:25,854
"Come here, come on you."

296
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:34,127
"Munni, look Chunni has come
to see you. Come on wake up."

297
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:44,134
Munni! Munni!
What...Please forgive me.

298
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:48,034
You turn me into an animal but
please spare my sister.

299
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:50,370
She is completely innocent.

300
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,572
She came in here
because of fear...

301
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,878
Fear!

302
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:59,015
Humans tread into this mansion
not for fear but for greed.

303
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,388
For the greed of the treasure...

304
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,961
The clothes and ornaments of
our ancestors mean...

305
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,826
only riches to you greedy people

306
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,931
I have been protecting the honour
of my ancestors for aeons.

307
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:23,504
And till the elements exist nothing
can take away this honour from us

308
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:32,445
"For centuries I have been ravenous,
for centuries I have been thirsting."

309
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,251
"l shall do whatever you ask me to.
- Oh, really?"

310
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:46,359
Tell me. What can you do for me?
- Anything. Whatever you ask of me

311
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:51,097
I only ask you to leave
Munni in return.

312
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:55,873
So you want Munni instead of the hen...

313
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:04,148
then in exchange for
Munni you get me hens.

314
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,816
"Tell me, how many hens
can you feed me?"

315
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:15,323
"As many as you ask me to.
1, 2, 5, 10, 20."

316
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,233
Shut up!

317
00:42:19,336 --> 00:42:22,066
"l am a witch hungry
for a hundred years,"

318
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:27,307
"l want at least a hundred hens.
No more, no less."

319
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,840
But don't worry.

320
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,850
I don't want
them all at once.

321
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:46,123
Get them for me everyday after
sunset but before sunrise.

322
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:53,325
The day you complete the quota of
one hundred hens...

323
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:58,873
I shall turn the hen back to Munni.

324
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:07,475
But if you dare tell this to anyone
then you will have to feed...

325
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:10,810
"on your sister's eggs all your life,
remember this."

326
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:19,290
"So, from this day, you shall
be both Chunni and Munni..."

327
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:22,832
for the rest of the world.

328
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:53,751
Uncle!

329
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:58,093
Munni!

330
00:43:58,602 --> 00:44:01,264
"Oh Munni! Where did you go
missing, Munni?"

331
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,596
"Munni, we have sitting here
waiting all night."

332
00:44:03,673 --> 00:44:07,131
Munni! Chunni simply vanished
after making us sit here.

333
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:12,844
Glory to the lord for sending this
little child back in one piece...

334
00:44:12,949 --> 00:44:14,780
from the Witch house.

335
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:17,943
Oh Lord! I shall make an
offering in the temple.

336
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:25,117
Whose hen is this?
- This is not a hen!

337
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:35,294
Was it a rooster?

338
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:42,138
Mother! Mother Hey Mother!

339
00:44:44,814 --> 00:44:47,305
What happened mother?
- Oh my son!

340
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:49,312
Why are you crying?

341
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:51,314
Both the kids are missing
since last night.

342
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:52,850
What are you saying mother!

343
00:44:52,922 --> 00:44:55,584
I'm telling the truth.
My little babies.

344
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:59,252
People are saying that both of them
have gone inside the Witch house.

345
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,588
What mother! The Witch house!
Stop crying mother!

346
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:03,994
Grandma!

347
00:45:05,268 --> 00:45:07,930
Where had you been?
Are you all right?

348
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:15,874
Don't cry grandma. I am here.
- My child. Little Chunni.

349
00:45:16,212 --> 00:45:19,340
"Mother, this is Munni, Not Chunni.
Look at the mole."

350
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:27,880
"Oh yes! This is Munni.
Where is Chunni, little child?"

351
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:32,324
"She's very scared, father.
Please don't scold her."

352
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,792
Do you think I'm a butcher?

353
00:45:38,835 --> 00:45:41,235
You kids are the two pieces
of my heart.

354
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:44,630
I shall die if anyone goes away.

355
00:45:46,976 --> 00:45:49,137
"Don't ever go close to
that house, again."

356
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:52,578
She won't
- Whose hen is this?

357
00:45:53,116 --> 00:45:57,576
Chunni and me have bought her from
our savings for Grandma.

358
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:01,990
The doctor says that an egg a day
is very good for grandma's eyesight.

359
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:12,592
"Tunni! Shall we name her Tunni,
your third sister?"

360
00:46:31,621 --> 00:46:34,613
"Munni, please forgive me."

361
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,750
"Once you become human again,"

362
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,623
I swear I shall never
play pranks on anybody.

363
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:49,801
"l will have to go now, okay?
Don't worry! I'll come back soon."

364
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:09,988
I have got a cane to
hit you from the city.

365
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:16,121
"Come on, get ready for
lunch, come."

366
00:47:20,937 --> 00:47:23,337
I have cooked the chicken specially
for you kids.

367
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,731
Here have this leg-piece.

368
00:47:33,616 --> 00:47:34,776
What happened?

369
00:47:35,985 --> 00:47:39,751
"Got it, you're saving the
piece for Munni isn't it!"

370
00:47:39,989 --> 00:47:42,321
Where is she?
- She's upstairs

371
00:47:42,692 --> 00:47:44,023
What's she doing?

372
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,357
Homework. She'll have
lunch after homework.

373
00:47:46,796 --> 00:47:48,957
Does she want to become
lndira Gandhi in a day!

374
00:47:49,232 --> 00:47:51,962
"Munni! O Munni!
- Grandma, Grandma. I'll call her."

375
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:54,296
"No, you have lunch. I'll call her.
- No, father. I'll call her."

376
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:57,563
"No, kid. You have your food.
I'll call her."

377
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:04,741
Munni! Munni! Little child.
Why do you study so much.

378
00:48:05,281 --> 00:48:07,272
Oh no! This darn nail.

379
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:12,244
"Munni, get me hammer."

380
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,282
I've told Mother time and again
to get this fixed by the carpenter

381
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:17,583
but she never listens to me.

382
00:48:18,862 --> 00:48:20,159
"Oh, come on out."

383
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,003
"Munni. Come on kid, time for food...
hey what happened?"

384
00:48:34,277 --> 00:48:36,268
Why are you panting so much?
- Panting?

385
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:40,947
I'm practicing for an athletic
competition in my school.

386
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:43,876
What's wrong with your cheek?
- Nothing

387
00:48:43,953 --> 00:48:45,944
Then why have you kept
your hand on it?

388
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:49,888
Oh yes? I've got a terrible toothache.
- Open your mouth. Show it to me.

389
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:56,831
Which is that terrible tooth
hurting my little child.

390
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,568
Let's go to the doctor
- It's all right now.

391
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:03,929
"Okay then, come have lunch with us.
- I'm not hungry father."

392
00:49:04,707 --> 00:49:07,938
"Come on child, I've cooked
chicken especially for you"

393
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,972
"No father, I'm not hungry at all!"

394
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:15,584
"Okay, if you don't
eat then I won't too"

395
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,604
"Munni! You are Munni, right?"

396
00:49:46,616 --> 00:49:48,948
"No, I'm her aunty"

397
00:49:52,722 --> 00:49:55,282
You've started speaking correctly!

398
00:49:56,926 --> 00:50:01,625
But I have been speaking
correctly ever sicne I was a kid

399
00:50:03,633 --> 00:50:06,625
That witch let you go?

400
00:50:07,637 --> 00:50:10,629
"Munni, shall I buy this pumpkin?
- Yes."

401
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:13,634
Give me the pumpkin.
- Even I am very fond of pumpkins.

402
00:50:14,944 --> 00:50:16,639
"Good morning, Masterji"

403
00:50:16,813 --> 00:50:19,646
And if Munni cooks it then
I shall have it too.

404
00:50:20,917 --> 00:50:25,149
I warned Kallu that if he
dares to scare any child

405
00:50:25,254 --> 00:50:26,915
I'll have him arrested.

406
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:31,320
"Munni, didn't you find
the Witch inside that house."

407
00:50:32,729 --> 00:50:36,665
Haven't you taught us that
witches and ghosts don't exist.

408
00:50:37,066 --> 00:50:39,057
"They do, Munni."

409
00:50:39,902 --> 00:50:42,837
Now look at your sister.
Isn't she a real life witch!

410
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:51,613
13 minus 7 equals 5...

411
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,946
1 1 multiplied by 1 1

412
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:23,641
You find the very funny
don't you. Have a good laugh

413
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:31,812
"I'm a bad girl right?
I deserve this, don't l!"

414
00:51:33,122 --> 00:51:36,649
I have to steal hens from Kallu's
place everyday for the witch

415
00:51:38,661 --> 00:51:42,927
"God, please help me complete
her demand of 100 hens..."

416
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,892
so that my little sister
can be human once again.

417
00:52:05,621 --> 00:52:07,612
Want a sip?
- No!

418
00:52:09,625 --> 00:52:13,959
This is the blood of a hawk.
It'll give you strength.

419
00:52:38,654 --> 00:52:40,645
Shall I go?

420
00:52:45,995 --> 00:52:51,262
Hang around.
Have the chicken with me

421
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,263
No

422
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:02,000
Okay. Go.

423
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:14,614
And listen... give my
love to Munni

424
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,290
And tomorrow...

425
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:39,137
Only Science provides
us with true knowledge.

426
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,640
How do things exist?

427
00:53:41,884 --> 00:53:43,875
And why don't certain
phenomenon exist?

428
00:53:44,053 --> 00:53:46,317
And how will those events occur
that need to occur and...

429
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:49,648
how to stop those that
need to be stopped?

430
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,852
Therefore.. science provides
us with concrete evidence.

431
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:56,588
Every action and reaction...

432
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:00,929
Chunni...

433
00:54:05,608 --> 00:54:09,203
"These stories of ghosts, ghouls
and witches are mere superstition."

434
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:21,022
Chunni. Come early tonight.
I am very hungry.

435
00:54:52,822 --> 00:54:54,813
Chunni!
- Yes.

436
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,855
What are you staring at outside?
- Outside there..

437
00:54:59,595 --> 00:55:01,586
There l...

438
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:05,328
Did you do your homework?
- What!

439
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:08,001
"l asked, did you do your homework?
- Yes, I did."

440
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:24,009
When did Vasco Da Gama come to lndia?
- 1498

441
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:29,881
(a+b} whole square?

442
00:55:30,026 --> 00:55:32,620
'a' square+'b' square+2ab

443
00:55:35,031 --> 00:55:39,627
Excellent! Why didn't
Munni come today?

444
00:55:41,637 --> 00:55:44,037
She is going to be absent
for the next 10 days

445
00:55:44,273 --> 00:55:47,242
What happened?
- A dog has bitten her.

446
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:48,732
Whose dog?

447
00:55:48,878 --> 00:55:52,712
There is a mad dog in our lane.
He bites everybody...

448
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,579
Poor Munni! All right..

449
00:55:55,751 --> 00:55:58,083
I shall come to your house
tomorrow after my morning walk

450
00:55:58,187 --> 00:55:59,313
Sir!

451
00:55:59,755 --> 00:56:03,191
I'll have tea with you...
the one with ginger.

452
00:56:04,593 --> 00:56:05,821
Sit down.

453
00:56:47,636 --> 00:56:50,628
Oh God! It bit me!
The dog bit me!

454
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:54,903
"Help me, I've been
bitten hard on my leg."

455
00:57:05,621 --> 00:57:07,589
You bark well.

456
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,924
He eats so much.
- Shall I ask you a question.

457
00:57:12,995 --> 00:57:14,986
Now what?
- Where is Munni?

458
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:20,202
Which dog has bitten her and if
you lied then why did you lie?

459
00:57:23,172 --> 00:57:25,163
Don't waste time thinking.
Just eat.

460
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:39,283
Hey my beautiful!

461
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:42,216
Where did you go my lovely?

462
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,616
What is it?
- This isn't yours?

463
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,626
I'm the only butcher in 5 villages.
If you find a razor...

464
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,895
...it belongs to the barber
and if you find a hen...

465
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,967
"Kallu, It's mine!"

466
00:57:57,907 --> 00:58:00,899
Then who does it belong to?
To the Butcher!

467
00:58:20,262 --> 00:58:22,924
Have your last
sip of water!

468
00:58:30,606 --> 00:58:33,598
"Hey, stop! You!
- What!"

469
00:58:34,009 --> 00:58:37,911
Don't even try to cross the limits.
- The hen belongs to me.

470
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:42,276
"Don't cry, child. Don't you cry.
Each drop of your tear is like pearl"

471
00:58:43,652 --> 00:58:46,780
The hen really belongs to me...
Ask the hen

472
00:58:47,623 --> 00:58:50,786
"Don't cry, Chunni. No matter who
troubles you, we shall not spare him."

473
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:52,823
"Yes, be it anybody"

474
00:58:53,028 --> 00:58:55,553
"Yes, be it this butcher
or be it the Witch."

475
00:59:02,905 --> 00:59:10,903
"A little boat
Floating like the moon"

476
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:28,154
"A little boat
Floating away..."

477
00:59:55,724 --> 01:00:02,630
"The day sets slowly, mother
And I grow afraid"

478
01:00:03,632 --> 01:00:06,624
The day flees and hides

479
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:10,128
In a dark house somewhere

480
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:15,633
"Dark night arrives,
the night of dread"

481
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:22,648
"Dark night,
the night of dread"

482
01:00:25,654 --> 01:00:27,645
Dear Mother

483
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:11,993
Night falls like a Spider's web

484
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:19,904
With gnarled hands and long nails

485
01:01:23,078 --> 01:01:28,983
Frightened and hiding

486
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:36,919
I search for somewhere safe

487
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:42,657
But darkness falls over me

488
01:01:46,735 --> 01:01:51,604
And clutches me in its claws

489
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:58,943
"Dark night, the night of dread"

490
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,645
Wriggling on my neck like a bug

491
01:02:38,821 --> 01:02:43,053
"That I cannot crush,
that crushes me"

492
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:52,995
"Save me from this ordeal, mother"

493
01:02:54,303 --> 01:03:00,867
Save me from this black curse

494
01:03:02,611 --> 01:03:05,944
"Who knows what tomorrow
has in store"

495
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,613
I dread tomorrow's twilight

496
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:22,628
"And dark night,
the night of dread"

497
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:39,630
Hey... who is it?

498
01:04:46,949 --> 01:04:48,940
Who is it?

499
01:04:51,019 --> 01:04:55,581
"lt is nobody! Why do shout
unnecessarily, nobody's there."

500
01:04:56,258 --> 01:04:59,250
Go to sleep. I shall cut
you tomorrow.

501
01:05:12,007 --> 01:05:15,101
"Oh, the box fell.
Now you hens go to sleep."

502
01:05:15,944 --> 01:05:18,208
You shall be cut tomorrow.

503
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,952
So once again you
come empty handed!

504
01:05:31,293 --> 01:05:33,955
"No aunty, I've got something
else today"

505
01:05:38,967 --> 01:05:40,958
What is this?
- Toffee.

506
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:42,626
What?

507
01:05:42,804 --> 01:05:45,637
Try to taste it.
You might like it.

508
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:58,577
Not this way. You open the wrapper
outside and eat the inside part.

509
01:06:07,696 --> 01:06:10,927
Not bad!
What do you call it?

510
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,862
Toffee

511
01:06:15,337 --> 01:06:17,328
fee... Toffee?

512
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:24,611
Should I get 100 of these
instead of the hens?

513
01:06:26,281 --> 01:06:28,272
Yes! Definitely!

514
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:37,285
Then I too shall give you a toad
instead of Munni. Think about it.

515
01:06:40,963 --> 01:06:46,333
Kallu has smelt a rat aunty. He sits
guarding his hens all night.

516
01:06:52,574 --> 01:06:55,168
"How is it my fault,
tell me?"

517
01:06:56,578 --> 01:07:00,571
You've managed only 7 hens
in the last 15 days.

518
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:08,185
At such a pace your sister shall
become a very old woman.

519
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:11,816
Remember this!

520
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:44,217
"Grandma, have you seen
my hen anywhere?"

521
01:07:44,626 --> 01:07:47,618
Don't know. Kallu too was
asking about her in the morning

522
01:07:49,731 --> 01:07:52,757
Who?
- Kallu. That foul butcher.

523
01:08:04,579 --> 01:08:07,104
Hey... what happened Chunni?
Why are you crying?

524
01:08:07,282 --> 01:08:09,580
Where is Kallu?
- Why are you crying?

525
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:13,050
He's gone to the next village to fetch
hens. Will you tell me what's wrong?

526
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,585
How many hens has he
cut since morning?

527
01:08:15,857 --> 01:08:17,848
None... Why?

528
01:08:18,593 --> 01:08:20,925
Did he get any new hen...
in the morning?

529
01:08:21,763 --> 01:08:23,754
"Tomorrow is Mushtaq's
marriage, right?"

530
01:08:23,865 --> 01:08:26,595
So he is collecting hens for the
party. He gets a few everyday.

531
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,863
I want my Munni back.

532
01:08:30,205 --> 01:08:32,605
He is collecting
hens not Munnis.

533
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:50,291
What's going on?
Will you tell me?

534
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:08,907
How many hens to go?

535
01:09:10,912 --> 01:09:12,243
92

536
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:19,576
What...

537
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:23,249
There are 93 in the shop which
means 92 real hens...

538
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:26,152
and the last one Munni
- So...

539
01:09:34,636 --> 01:09:39,801
"Push a little harder, Chunni.
We'll be in big trouble if caught."

540
01:09:40,142 --> 01:09:42,133
I'm trying my best.

541
01:09:56,625 --> 01:10:00,959
You hardly paid any attention
to whatever I taught you.

542
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:13,832
"But if what you say is true,
then the activities inside..."

543
01:10:15,644 --> 01:10:18,044
this house are dangerous
for the entire village.

544
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:21,844
I shall go in...

545
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,908
"No, Masterji.
We'll come in with you."

546
01:10:23,985 --> 01:10:26,647
"No, you'll go the Police Station
and get Ghanta and Banta here."

547
01:10:26,922 --> 01:10:28,913
"But, Masterji....
- Go now..."

548
01:10:35,997 --> 01:10:37,191
Uncle!

549
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:40,998
"Banta, we will have
to be very careful"

550
01:10:42,904 --> 01:10:45,668
"Chunni, what you have done has
pained our heart."

551
01:10:45,907 --> 01:10:48,899
If I knew I would have torn
that Witch into pieces.

552
01:10:52,013 --> 01:10:53,344
What happened?

553
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:57,948
How would you have done that?
By your mere hands?

554
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:03,621
Oh No! We forgot our guns
in the Police Station.

555
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:05,715
Oh God!

556
01:11:05,794 --> 01:11:08,957
You kids go towards the house.
We'll be there pronto.

557
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:15,864
"And listen, no matter what
happens, don't go inside...Okay?"

558
01:11:34,389 --> 01:11:37,654
It's been hours.
When will they be here?

559
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:42,663
There is no clue about Masterji.
Even the hens are missing.

560
01:11:45,066 --> 01:11:48,661
Should we go in?
- No way!

561
01:11:57,612 --> 01:11:59,011
Aunt...

562
01:12:11,793 --> 01:12:13,886
"Tell me what you
want to turn into,"

563
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,293
"a toad, a bird,
an earthworm or a snake."

564
01:12:16,698 --> 01:12:18,632
Please forgive me Aunty.

565
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,291
There is no forgiveness for deceit
in the realm of the witch.

566
01:12:21,636 --> 01:12:24,230
It's no fault of mine.
I am innocent.

567
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:28,040
Innocent!
Your spy had come here.

568
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:33,975
He is our teacher.
- Not any more.

569
01:12:40,322 --> 01:12:44,986
You found your hens. Please
make Munni a human being.

570
01:12:48,663 --> 01:12:50,858
You will have to be punished
for the deceit.

571
01:12:52,267 --> 01:12:54,599
Please forgive me Aunt.

572
01:12:56,604 --> 01:12:57,935
100 Goats

573
01:12:58,206 --> 01:13:02,939
100 goats. How can I get
them all alone?

574
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,614
You should have thought
about it before trying to cheat me.

575
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:09,112
Get lost!

576
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:13,082
Hey... hang on.

577
01:13:13,621 --> 01:13:17,352
Take your teacher along with you.

578
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:32,833
"Masterji, what's happened
to you Masterji?"

579
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:40,645
He shall teach you now...
the knowledge of science.

580
01:13:50,425 --> 01:13:52,359
"What happened, Chunni?"

581
01:13:52,927 --> 01:13:57,159
She's very angry.
Has asked me for 100 goats.

582
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,195
Where will I find 100 goats?

583
01:14:02,303 --> 01:14:04,863
"Look, what she has
done to our Masterji."

584
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:11,045
Masterji? Aladdin..
this is Aladdin!

585
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,275
Aladdin!

586
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:29,363
Science is what provides us
with real knowledge.

587
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:31,622
How do things exist?

588
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:33,733
And why don't certain
phenomenon exist?

589
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:37,999
"These stories of ghosts, ghouls and
witches are mere superstition."

590
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:42,076
"lf this is Aldadin, not Masterji."

591
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:45,135
Then that hen couldn't
have been Munni.

592
01:14:46,147 --> 01:14:49,810
Which means that
the Witch isn't a Witch.

593
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:58,786
Hey come on in. Don't be afraid.
- I'm not.

594
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:01,862
What's that? Throw the torchlight.
It's Masterji's watch.

595
01:15:02,263 --> 01:15:03,821
Oh yes!

596
01:15:11,272 --> 01:15:13,832
What's this?
Masterji's stick!

597
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:18,604
Yes! What's that?
- Masterji's cap!

598
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:25,210
Look! Look!

599
01:15:25,887 --> 01:15:33,225
Hey Chunni! So it's you! And you've
got a friend along with you.

600
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:37,959
No.. aunt... my friend
got those hens for you...

601
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:43,295
I wanted to ask when
should I get the goats.

602
01:15:44,639 --> 01:15:46,300
What's his name?

603
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:50,903
Mu... Mu... Mugale Azam.

604
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:59,587
Mugale Azam! That's a good name.
Wow! Look who has come to visit us!

605
01:16:01,923 --> 01:16:03,914
Uncle! Uncle! She is the witch.

606
01:16:04,259 --> 01:16:07,922
Don't be afraid! She's our aunt.
Come... come alone.

607
01:16:08,596 --> 01:16:10,928
No uncle... no...

608
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:14,958
Come on...
Come on.

609
01:17:11,826 --> 01:17:13,817
"Munni, you're alive!"

610
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:22,059
Munni.. are you alright?

611
01:17:28,009 --> 01:17:31,206
Everything will be alright.
We'll find them.

612
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,277
"How will we find them, Mukiyaji!
Ghanta and Banta are missing."

613
01:17:35,783 --> 01:17:37,842
There is no news of Masterji.

614
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,021
And my Mugale Azam.
He too is missing.

615
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,280
"Mukhiyaji, you please inform
the Collector in the city."

616
01:17:43,391 --> 01:17:46,292
"That'll result in a calamity,
Mukhiyaji!"

617
01:17:46,928 --> 01:17:48,919
All this is the result of
the Witch's wrath.

618
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:51,090
We cannot make her angrier.

619
01:17:51,633 --> 01:17:54,898
We cannot risk the life of all
the villager for 3 or 4 people

620
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:58,564
3 or 4 people are missing today.
Tomorrow it could be us or our kids.

621
01:17:58,973 --> 01:18:02,909
Do you want us to watch
the whole thing quielty?

622
01:18:03,244 --> 01:18:06,236
"No, we will have to sacrifice
a goat in Goddess Kali's temple."

623
01:18:06,714 --> 01:18:09,148
No. What sacrifice! Mukhiyaji..

624
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,241
"Look Kallu, the witch
is very angry..."

625
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,850
"You shut up! Mukhiyaji, you go
to the city..."

626
01:18:13,955 --> 01:18:17,118
call the police and search
that witch house.

627
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:19,583
This sacrifice story
will do nothing for us

628
01:18:19,727 --> 01:18:22,594
"No matter who went there,
came out an animal."

629
01:18:22,897 --> 01:18:24,831
"Am I right, brothers?
- Yes!"

630
01:18:24,932 --> 01:18:27,196
"What do you mean, yes.."

631
01:18:28,903 --> 01:18:32,600
he... he has returned...

632
01:18:33,608 --> 01:18:37,772
Iook at him... my dear Aladdin.

633
01:19:30,998 --> 01:19:33,592
"You bring me great luck,
Chunni."

634
01:19:35,803 --> 01:19:39,933
Today I shall be rewarded
for my unshakeable dedication.

635
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:45,612
"Hey, carry on digging or else the witch
shall turn you all into rats!"

636
01:19:48,249 --> 01:19:50,615
These villagers are real dimwits.

637
01:19:50,885 --> 01:19:52,876
Such a rare treasure
is buried in their own backyard

638
01:19:52,987 --> 01:19:56,218
and these people
don't have a clue.

639
01:19:57,291 --> 01:20:02,285
"Only if your uncle were alive today,
he would have been such a proud man."

640
01:20:07,635 --> 01:20:10,229
Our uncle was in the
Archaeological Department.

641
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,299
After years of research he found
out that an ancient statue...

642
01:20:13,641 --> 01:20:16,974
is buried somewhere
in the palace of Sitapur.

643
01:20:17,845 --> 01:20:21,645
But before he could
inform the the government...

644
01:20:24,218 --> 01:20:26,914
Aunty made sure that he was buried
somewhere in his own house.

645
01:20:28,322 --> 01:20:30,313
Aunty... you are great!

646
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:34,057
That's enought Go and get
me something to eat!

647
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:35,924
Yes aunty!

648
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,337
"For centuries I have been ravenous,
for centuries I have been thirsting."

649
01:20:45,673 --> 01:20:47,163
Water! Water!

650
01:20:47,408 --> 01:20:50,002
Munni... Munni... what happened

651
01:20:52,046 --> 01:20:54,310
Have some pity on
these little children.

652
01:20:54,682 --> 01:20:57,276
They have been digging
continously for the past 18 hours.

653
01:20:57,785 --> 01:21:01,778
The digging won't stop
till that statue is found.

654
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,192
Please give some water.

655
01:21:06,260 --> 01:21:08,956
You'll get nothing till
the statue is found.

656
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:13,631
Keep on digging Masterji or
else Munni will die.

657
01:21:19,907 --> 01:21:21,033
Aunty!

658
01:21:23,811 --> 01:21:28,043
"lt is the blood of a Hawk,
Chunni. Want a sip?"

659
01:21:30,117 --> 01:21:32,108
No. I've spiked it with
crow's blood too.

660
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:34,916
No. This is bat's blood.

661
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:41,055
"This is grape juice,
you silly!"

662
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:54,274
"You are no less than
an invaluable statue, Chunni"

663
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:58,939
Haven't you been feeding us
such delicious hens for so many days

664
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:03,616
We would have died of
hunger if it wasn't for you

665
01:22:05,686 --> 01:22:10,623
I knew that you will do
anything to save Munni.

666
01:22:11,025 --> 01:22:13,892
"You will thieve, lie and even rob."

667
01:22:14,962 --> 01:22:17,954
That is why I spared you
from this drudgery.

668
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:23,627
This statue has sacrificed
so many little children.

669
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:29,974
I have lost count of
how many in the last 5 years.

670
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:38,376
But no one as clever as you.

671
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:54,166
Move over!

672
01:23:04,111 --> 01:23:08,309
Hurry up.
Get it out quickly!

673
01:23:26,033 --> 01:23:28,866
Will get at least a million for it

674
01:23:29,637 --> 01:23:30,968
Rupees?

675
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:34,267
"Dollars, you idiot!"

676
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:36,242
Hey! Dollars!!
