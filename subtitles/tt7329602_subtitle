1
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:54,880
'TamilRockers'

2
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,880
- Wretches! They would've killed us!
- Thankfully, the rain saved us!

3
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,320
'Owing to the communal riots
at the Melapakkam village in Madurai...'

4
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,200
'...a curfew order
has been put in place'

5
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,560
'The rioters burned down
several huts and vehicles'

6
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,520
'So far, six people from both sides
have died in the riot'

7
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,480
'As the riots are expected to worsen...'

8
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,000
'...the police are gearing up
Finish it in a flash!'

9
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,320
Just 'cause the cops show up
with all their swagger...

10
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,880
...did they think we'd
cower about at home?

11
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,960
This is the soil that births warriors!

12
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,360
Our blows must set them on fire!

13
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,200
It doesn't matter
how many heads roll

14
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,200
- We must put an end to it right now!
- We will!

15
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,080
Claiming to be the superior caste,
how long can they walk over us?

16
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,080
- We will end it!
- Only if we strike back, can we live!

17
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Strike back, we will!

18
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,920
Madurai Collector, Rajkumar speaking

19
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,520
- Yes, sir!
- When will you be here?

20
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,600
I am on the way

21
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,920
I'll be there in an hour

22
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,280
- I'll be right back
- Alright, sir

23
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,680
Everything is going according to plan

24
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,800
Both sides are furious, sir

25
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,040
We can't resolve this with discussions

26
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,040
Give us the order to shoot on sight

27
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,560
Take out four of them
and the rest will fall in line!

28
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,240
What are you saying, sir?

29
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,840
The election is just a few days away

30
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,760
If the cops kill anyone of either clan...

31
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,440
...the Chief Minister feels
that it will affect the election

32
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,520
We can't take any such rash actions

33
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,600
If we can't take action,
how do we curb the riots?

34
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,920
I need to think about it
Please leave me alone

35
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,840
Have you found the solution,
Commissioner?

36
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,200
No, sir
I'm still thinking about it

37
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,280
A curfew has been ordered here
To an extent, riots have been curbed

38
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,840
How do you intend to stop the riots?

39
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,560
Answer us, sir!

40
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,360
What does your silence imply?

41
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,600
Is it under control?

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I feel so sorry for the
Commissioner, Paramu

43
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,560
Look how dumbstruck he looks,
with no way to stop the riots!

44
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,800
These guys are cops in name only

45
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,400
Only 'he' can handle such issues

46
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,680
If 'he' were here,
he'd deal with it, in such a badass way

47
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,160
- Really?
- Hey!

48
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,560
What did you say?
What did you just say right now?

49
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,840
Nothing at all, sir!

50
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,920
Who was the 'he'
you were talking about?

51
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
He is...

52
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,600
Oh dear!
This tree stands so very tall!

53
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,440
How can this puny old man climb
and pluck coconuts from it?

54
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:46,680
Is there no one who can come to the aid
of this downtrodden farmer?

55
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,800
My dear boy!

56
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,800
You came forth like a God
and plucked these coconuts

57
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,520
May you have a prosperous life!

58
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,040
Every coconut pastry I eat,
contains the sweat of farmers like you!

59
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,320
I can never stand by
and watch farmers suffer!

60
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,120
For your good heart, I wish you will be
the head of every association in the world!

61
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,920
I have no such wishes, kind sir

62
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,840
I'll take your leave
Praise be to India!

63
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,720
How are you, Shiva?

64
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,040
Anyone who serves the people
will never be in a bad state

65
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,880
I'm aware of that
I asked how you are doing

66
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,360
Okay
Tell me what's up!

67
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,040
You must have watched the news

68
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,480
There's a huge riot
over at Melapakkam

69
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,120
It has gone out of our control

70
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,840
Only you can stop it, Shiva

71
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,320
Once I've made a decision,
I don't even listen to myself!

72
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,280
All well and good
You can listen to me, right? Please come

73
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
I can't, sir!

74
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,600
Besides you, who else does this land
and these people have?

75
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,360
Alright!
I'm coming

76
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,920
The crap I have to say for this!

77
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,600
Time's racing by
Don't know when Shiva's coming

78
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,200
Welcome back, Shiva!
Where were you all this time?

79
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,040
It's been thirty minutes
since I arrived!

80
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,400
The lion's here, sir!

81
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Come along, sir!

82
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,440
What happened after they promoted you
as DGP, in the first movie?

83
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,000
Please get me a water packet
I'll go freshen up

84
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,960
- Take care of it, Paramu
- Yes, come, sir!

85
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,280
All problems solved!

86
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,680
See how great our Shiva is!

87
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,880
Let me know what you need
to stop these riots

88
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,760
We got an entire police force
We got 7 CRPF battalions!

89
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,760
The army's on the way!

90
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,040
Besides that, we have tear gas bombs
and pellet guns. What do you need?

91
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,640
Have them buy an 'idly' for me

92
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,960
I wasn't aware you came by
without breakfast. Sorry

93
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,640
The 'idly' is not breakfast
It is to stop this riot!

94
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,520
What is this, Shiva?

95
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,320
How can you stop such a huge riot
with a single 'idly'?

96
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,280
That's all I need

97
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,920
'Here's our correspondent Hardik Pandey,
to give us a live update about the riots!'

98
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,120
'Good day!
A special officer has arrived here!'

99
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:40,640
'He has ordered 3 'dosas'
for breakfast!'

100
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,560
Can you definitely confirm
that he ordered 3 'dosas'?

101
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,560
Definitely, Fatima
He ordered 3 'dosas'

102
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,720
Per our inside source,
he definitely ordered 3 'dosas'!

103
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,720
As soon as the officer
who is supposed to stop the riot arrived...

104
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:57,200
...he ordered 3 'puri' sets
on the government's money!

105
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,440
- What do you make of it?
- Really stupid, sir!

106
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,920
How will you get 'puris' at that hour?
Even if you do...

107
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,040
...the potato curry
can lead to hot air issues!

108
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,560
He should've ordered 'kal dosa'!
All wrong in this minority government!

109
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
The opposition party is behind this mess!

110
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,600
Our lord, the savior of the poor,
the god of love...

111
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Under the noble rule of
our Chief Minister...

112
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,600
...I swear that 'kal dosas'
will always be available in any eatery!

113
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,240
I fully credit my national party
for that dish's arrival in Tamil Nadu!

114
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,240
They've begun fighting, sir!

115
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,520
Please do something!

116
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,760
Forget that bulb, Shiva
What do we do now?

117
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,600
Stop it!
All of you!

118
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
Climb on, sir!

119
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,680
The 'idly', sir

120
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,560
- Have you eaten?
- Yes

121
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,480
- How about you?
- I did

122
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,120
Then this 'idly' is not yours

123
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,640
Yes, it's not mine

124
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,920
It's not mine, either

125
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,120
How correct you are!

126
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,160
Every 'idly' prepared after we eat,
is not ours

127
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,920
Why do I say this? Listen up
Mahatma Gandhi was born from this soil

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
No sound must be heard from it
No blood must be spilt on it

129
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,960
I've observed for a few days
that violence has increased in our nation

130
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,200
Sound everywhere
Blood everywhere

131
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,560
The blood in everyone's veins
is red in color

132
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,000
If Ismail needs blood,
Murugan gives it!

133
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,200
If Murugan needs blood,
Michael gives it!

134
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,920
If Michael himself needs blood,
Ismail's brother Anwar gives it!

135
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,960
This is a chain!
One that is forged and united by love!

136
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,160
The rust called 'caste'
is attempting to scratch away that chain!

137
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,200
For a scratch on skin,
'Itch Guard' can help

138
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,160
But how can the chain of love
be destroyed?

139
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,840
'Jain' is very important

140
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:48,040
If I'm speaking here,
it's only because of...

141
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,680
...Surya Prakash Jain
who finances this whole industry!

142
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,760
Even flowers have classes, but does it
know the class of person who wears it?

143
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,000
So do vegetables,
but does it ever fight about it?

144
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,440
Shiva is here
He's talking

145
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,480
It's going per our plan!

146
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,240
Listen to me very carefully

147
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,920
Unity is most important

148
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,800
Least from now,
let us no longer have casteism

149
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,800
God gave us six senses

150
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,320
Only with that, did Manoj Night Shyamalan
make a film called 'The Sixth Sense'

151
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,880
Lakshmi Menon scored 800 marks
in her high school exam

152
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,680
Have you ever once wondered why?
Never mind that

153
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,520
Why do innocents die in Afghanistan?

154
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,240
Why did Sunny Leone enter this industry?

155
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,080
Has anyone ever thought about
any of this even once?

156
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,200
In an Indian Premiere League auction,
they gave Unadkat 8 crore rupees

157
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,680
- He couldn't even take 2 wickets
- He's still talking!

158
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,680
Have you ever wondered
why this happened?

159
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,040
Here's another one

160
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,800
Bill Gates. Do you know him?
How did he become a billionaire?

161
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,320
How did Steve Jobs create iPhone?

162
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,680
Both of them accomplished that
with their intellect!

163
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,560
How many upgrades has the iPhone had?

164
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,280
8. 8- Plus. Now 10
Soon, there'll be another model

165
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,520
When it's out, we'll be asked
if we bought it. Prestige issue

166
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,240
You must decide what is important
and what isn't

167
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,880
Come on up, all of you
Study history! Watch the Discovery Channel!

168
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,760
Do any of you know what happened
in the city of Rome in 1865?

169
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,360
Do you know, bro?
How about you, sis?

170
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
You, in the back!

171
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,240
Never mind that
Do we at least know our country's history?

172
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,520
The first history of
our world, is ours!

173
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,840
The great Tamil history...

174
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,240
- Please forgive us, sir!
- Spare us, sir!

175
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,400
- Get up
- We'll get along like brothers, sir!

176
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,480
Please let us go

177
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,240
Listen up
No more fighting. Stay united

178
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:37,640
If not, he'll be back!

179
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
Oh dear God, no!
I can't take any more of it!

180
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,360
Hug each other

181
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,480
We won't fight anymore

182
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,560
Live long, Tamil

183
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,880
He resolved such a huge riot
without batting an eye!

184
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,920
The International Superstar!
The Big Commander!

185
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,120
Long live our king!
Please, no!

186
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,000
I don't like this sort of thing

187
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,480
"O dear proxy of a tsunami!"

188
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,120
"O vanquisher of evil wolves..."

189
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,720
No need for all that crap!

190
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,120
"Leave me alone!"

191
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,480
Rejoin the police force!

192
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,720
"Please leave me alone!
Listen to me!"

193
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,280
Hold on!
I beg of you!

194
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,960
"Leave me alone!
Please rejoin the police force!"

195
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,840
"Please, please leave me alone!"
The police need you!

196
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,360
Please listen to me!

197
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,640
"I am nobody!"

198
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,560
"I am nothing!"

199
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,760
"I am worthless!"

200
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,280
"I do nothing!"

201
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
"I belong nowhere!"

202
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,000
"I have no profession!"

203
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,160
"I have no intelligence!"

204
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,880
"I can't do crap!"

205
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,080
"I have no mass!"

206
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,200
"I have no velocity!"

207
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,880
"I have no volume!"

208
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,720
"I have no gravity!"

209
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,920
"I am no lion!"

210
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,640
"I am no tiger!"

211
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,600
"I am no giraffe!"

212
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,440
"I am no zebra, either!"

213
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,880
"A nut is what you are!"

214
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,960
"What do I care if PETA shows up?"

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,760
"What do I care if methane is extracted?"

216
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,360
"I won't open my mouth
I'll always leave it shut!"

217
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,320
"All I want is a U-rating!
Full tax exemption!"

218
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,200
"I want a mass opening!"

219
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,920
"That's enough for me!"

220
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,960
"All I want is a U-rating!
Full tax exemption!"

221
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,880
"I want a mass opening!"

222
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,760
"That's enough for me!"

223
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,480
"You must be prosperous,
for the nation to thrive!"

224
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,000
"For the plight of the poor
in this nation to improve!"

225
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,600
"All Clear!
Come on, Come on"

226
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,480
"I'm coming!"

227
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,480
"When will I come?
How will I come?"

228
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,680
"Where will I come?
I have no clue!"

229
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,520
"No clue on why I'll come, either!"

230
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,480
"Why?
Cause no way I'm going to come!"

231
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,920
"Not a group that came as one for a cause
Just a bunch of extras on set!"

232
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,600
"Neither the milk of Tamil,
nor the milk of Telugu!"

233
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,080
"It is milk produced by the Aavin brand,
which makes me live!"

234
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,960
"I will not speak during elections!"

235
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,880
"I won't share thoughts on Twitter!"

236
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,800
"I won't dive into politics!"

237
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,680
"I won't meditate in the beach!"

238
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:47,160
"I don't know how to act!
My father never taught me!"

239
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,040
Well, you can't run
and you can't hide!

240
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,600
So, I'm going to America!

241
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,480
"Live and let live!"

242
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,680
"Let me rock the slow motion walk!"

243
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,480
"You and I are friends!"

244
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,200
I'll kick the ass out of you!

245
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,000
"I came from the world of television"

246
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,880
"My poor producer
doesn't even own a car!"

247
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:25,960
"My lifeblood is this union!"

248
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,400
"Only after building the marriage hall,
will I be wed!"

249
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,280
"I am no leader!
I have no wish to be so!"

250
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,880
"I have no fan club!"

251
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,920
"I have disbanded it!"

252
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,800
"I had no films
because I talked too much!"

253
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,840
"I made a comeback
Now my call sheets are full!"

254
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,840
"This is the attacking Shiva!"

255
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,760
"This is the confrontational Shiva!"

256
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,600
"This is the flirtatious Shiva!"

257
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,640
"This is the intimidating Shiva!"

258
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,520
"This is the intuitive Shiva!"

259
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,360
"This is the assaulting Shiva!"

260
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,040
We have bad news, sir

261
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:05,480
He left after stating
that he won't rejoin the police department

262
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,880
Who is he?

263
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,680
The city respects him immensely!

264
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,000
He is our God, sir!

265
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,960
He turned our barren land of Cinemapatti
into a prosperous abode!

266
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:12,020
Priya!
Please pick up that courier!

267
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,500
Just a minute, Granny!

268
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,060
- I'll take that
- Please sign here, ma'am

269
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,620
Here you go

270
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,740
What letter is that?

271
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,500
Not a letter, but a phone!

272
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,420
Someone named P sent it!

273
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,620
- A phone?
- Yes, Granny!

274
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,780
What phone?

275
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,420
Oh no!
Don't open it!

276
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,580
What happened?

277
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,940
Don't go out there, sir!
Stop!

278
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,300
Priya!

279
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,860
What happened, Priya?

280
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:36,500
Breathe, Priya!
Breathe!

281
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,300
They've made you
unrecognizable, Priya!

282
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:42,660
I can't bear to look at your face, Priya!

283
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,540
They have destroyed you
beyond recognition!

284
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,900
I wish to rejoin duty!

285
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,780
Shoot that shield

286
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,740
Shoot it, I say!

287
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,980
Had you been the old Selvam,
the shield would be out the window by now!

288
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,820
You would've slapped me
before I did!

289
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,860
You are not the old Selvam anymore!

290
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,100
I am not Selvam, sir!
My name is Shiva!

291
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,540
It all came in a flow!

292
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,860
Now go

293
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,660
Come back as the Shiva I know

294
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:21,900
"From the scorching depths of fire..."

295
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:27,300
"...flies the phoenix, back to life!"

296
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:34,620
"All the obstacles
that stand in the way..."

297
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:38,220
"...will melt away, today!"

298
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,180
"Even if the dog barks at the sun..."

299
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,300
"...or if the dog wishes to bite it..."

300
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,540
"...it can never happen!"

301
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,980
"The sun will give nothing!"

302
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,540
"For this is life..."

303
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,860
"...and your will to kill
will end in victory!"

304
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,620
"History will dawn upon thee!"

305
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:09,660
"Fish lives in the water
Deer thrives in the forest!"

306
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,260
"But, a leopard, this fiery,
survives anywhere!"

307
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,900
"A fallen seed rises up fiercely..."

308
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:29,460
"...and like Cyclone Vardah,
it roars with fury!"

309
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,500
"Here it comes, now!"

310
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,460
"Coming right at us, right now!"

311
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,460
Didn't I tell you?

312
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,820
Go!
Come back as the Shiva I know

313
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,980
Sorry
I can't do that exercise routine again

314
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,780
I'm very tired
Please let me join!

315
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,860
I can't, Shiva!

316
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,660
One needn't wear a
khaki uniform to be a cop!

317
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,580
- There are plainclothes cops, too!
- Here he goes again!

318
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,500
When I perform my police duties
in colored clothes...

319
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,300
...you can trap me
as a plainclothes cop!

320
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,660
One more thing, sir!

321
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,980
Kids wear color dresses
only on their birthdays, sir!

322
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,900
- Don't think bad about it!
- Good grief!

323
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,980
Please stop it, Shiva!
You're appointed!

324
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,020
Ex-policeman Shiva...

325
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:36,340
...is taking oath as an undercover cop
You are watching this covert ceremony live!

326
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:40,020
His re- joining the police force
is a top secret event

327
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,780
I, Shiva...

328
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,380
I...Shiva...

329
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,300
...pledge to honour the police force

330
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,380
Poor chap!
Someone murdered his wife with a bomb

331
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,740
He is sobbing while being sworn in

332
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,340
If it were me, I'd be happy!

333
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,940
I solemnly swear to keep this secret post,
secret from everyone

334
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,940
I promise to guard the secrets
of the police department...

335
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:09,980
...and never ever betray it,
come what may!

336
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,860
I swear this oath!

337
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,780
Tell me now, Commissioner!

338
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,020
Who is that son of David,
who killed my wife?

339
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,620
We don't even know the killer's name

340
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,580
How do you know
that he is the son of David?

341
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:30,900
He could be a Michael's son!

342
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,060
Even if he were Michael's son,
he would still be the son of a David!

343
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,780
Based on the clues from the bomb...

344
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,580
...it is evident that his name is P

345
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,580
He lives in the dark
and even his shadow hasn't seen him!

346
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,220
It is your duty to solve the mystery

347
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,460
Definitely, sir!

348
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,020
It's my duty

349
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,460
You must be tired
Get some sleep. We will meet tomorrow

350
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,540
Sorry, sir

351
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,780
No matter how tired I am,
I shall not sleep until I find him!

352
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:18,980
It's already a day since she died
How long are you going to mourn her?

353
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,540
If not for your sake
At least think about the kids!

354
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,660
But I have no kids, granny!

355
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,940
That's exactly
why I want you to get married!

356
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,340
I'll think about it

357
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,820
Can't stand the ragging by our seniors

358
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,300
- Just another day in the life of a fresher!
- Look at him talk!

359
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:49,380
Don't worry
We can rag the newcomers next year!

360
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,260
- Look who is here!
- Where were you all these days?

361
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,340
How are you?
Shouldn't you be in college now?

362
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,660
As always, we have bunked college!

363
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,580
Dude, are you working
as an undercover cop?

364
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,740
- It was on TV!
- It's top secret!

365
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,100
Highly confidential!

366
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,420
Why did you rejoin the police force?

367
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,700
Dude, Priya was murdered
in a bomb blast!

368
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,580
I have rejoined the department
to seek revenge!

369
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:19,420
If a beloved parts,
we should depart too!

370
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
What?

371
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,180
I mean, you should stop crying
and move on in life!

372
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,980
Nakul is right
You need a shoulder to cry on!

373
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,260
I have you three!

374
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,980
- Can I not lean on you?
- Of course you can!

375
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,220
But if you lean on a girl...

376
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,860
...it would be a lot more fun!

377
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,140
Granny said the same thing!
You guys are telling it too!

378
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,780
Seems like the right thing to do!

379
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,500
I will find someone as beautiful as Priya!
Fall in love!

380
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,980
The trend was different then
Things are different now!

381
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,340
- That's why I have two conditions!
- What are those?

382
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,660
Condition #1

383
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,020
- She should be as fair as a Barbie doll!
- Okay!

384
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Condition #2

385
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,380
She should be loony as a Toon!

386
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,700
Fair enough!

387
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,940
How loony?

388
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,060
Like the girl from the
film 'Santosh Subramaniam'?

389
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,340
Loonier than that!

390
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,300
Like the one in the film 'Vedalam'?

391
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,140
Too greedy!

392
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:14,140
I have an idea!

393
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,540
- Just close your eyes!
- Why?

394
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,260
Close your eyes
and open them after a while

395
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:27,140
The girl you see, is the one meant for you
Come on, close your eyes!

396
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:52,180
Don't keep the shot on the face!
Keep it on the feet!

397
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,740
Poor guy!
Let me help you cross the road!

398
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,100
Why is she going into my house?

399
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,980
Granny!
Who is the new girl in our building?

400
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,940
They have moved into the flat
above ours!

401
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,100
That laughter!
Exceeded my expectation!

402
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:50,580
It struck me hard
and made me soar!

403
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,060
I didn't expect this to happen!

404
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:53,820
But it was happening!

405
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,980
She noticed something in me!

406
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,340
And that has appealed to her!

407
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,460
I wanted to show it to her every day!

408
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,060
At that moment,
I decided that she is my life partner!

409
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,660
Dude, I'm very certain...

410
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,020
...that she is loony
Saw her board the mental hospital bus!

411
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,060
Super, da

412
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,660
Propose to her right away!

413
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,140
How can I propose to her without knowing
whether she likes me or not?

414
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:51,100
You are the hero
Her likes or dislikes are of no importance!

415
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,980
If you are the hero, she has to
fall in love with you. That's the law!

416
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,540
If she doesn't love you,
you can stalk her around!

417
00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:02,260
You may lie, cheat, kidnap
or threaten to commit suicide!

418
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,900
The girl will have no choice
but to fall in love with you!

419
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:11,780
Isn't it wrong to torture someone
to make them love you?

420
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,260
Why are they laughing
at me like this?

421
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,140
This is the trend now!

422
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,060
Go and propose to her right now!

423
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,660
Don't think too much!
It is her birthday tomorrow!

424
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,100
Go and propose to her at midnight!

425
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,300
I have decided to do it!

426
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:33,460
I will propose to her
like no one has ever before!

427
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,980
What are you going to do?

428
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,900
This will cost you about 20 lakhs!

429
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,180
I'm in love!

430
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,180
What else will I spend
on if not for this?

431
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,940
Brother, you owe me 56 rupees

432
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,340
Bro, I will pay you later
Little dry now!

433
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,220
Happy birthday, Ramya

434
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,740
Hello, sister

435
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,180
- Welcome, sister!
- Come to the terrace, will you?

436
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,380
Why?

437
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,940
Come!
I will tell you!

438
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,460
I'll just come, okay?

439
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,700
Sister, where are you taking me?

440
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:20,300
What are you doing?
Why did you bring me here?

441
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,660
You could've given this downstairs!

442
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,900
This isn't mine

443
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,860
A guy asked me to give this to you
without anyone's knowledge

444
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,340
- Blow it!
- No way!

445
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:50,220
Just blow it!

446
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,420
Who is he?

447
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,060
How am I supposed to know?
I was asked to give it to you and I did!

448
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,220
If you want to,
go down and find the guy!

449
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,180
You will see a silhouette
of a young man!

450
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,260
He will tell you everything!

451
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:24,500
Happy Birthday, Loony!

452
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:26,940
Did you do all this
just to wish me for my birthday?

453
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,420
- No, I have something more to say!
- What is it?

454
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,300
I love you, Ramya

455
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:37,380
Why would someone waste so much money
to say these three words?

456
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:40,860
Exactly!
Drive some sense into his head!

457
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,500
It has been 3 months
since the bathroom light conked out!

458
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,900
He hasn't fixed it yet!
I'm groping in the dark!

459
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,460
Now, he has dazzled
the entire street with lights!

460
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,660
Look at his face!

461
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:54,380
How do you intend to take care of me
if you splurge all your money?

462
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,180
Do you also love me?

463
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,580
The day you jumped over the gate
is when I fell for you!

464
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,860
All this for nothing?

465
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:13,540
Siddarth! Switch off all the lights!

466
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,900
Bro, are you alright?
Who are you? His face is disfigured!

467
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,420
Buddy!

468
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,100
Breathe!

469
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,580
Siddarth!
Gone too soon!

470
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,060
- Go ahead with your duet!
- What are you saying?

471
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,060
I have done the same, man!

472
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,540
What do you say?
Shall we go for a duet?

473
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,780
Thanks, brother

474
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,980
"O riot of love,
O love riot!"

475
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,700
"O love riot,
it is your face that pops up"

476
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,940
"With your beauty and smile,
come and steal my heart away"

477
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,380
"O you, young sapling,
my fruit bearing little thing!"

478
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,980
"I suffer the same fate"

479
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,340
"To unite body and soul,
come to me, O my love!"

480
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:21,900
"Only until the wedding..."

481
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,380
"And, after that?"

482
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,620
"No, thanks!"

483
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:28,500
"What is to be of our Tamil culture?"

484
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:02,260
"Let your eyes never meet mine!
Even by mistake!"

485
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:07,020
"A sin more sinister
doesn't exist on earth!"

486
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,740
"With moons so many on the sky,
the stars do fade away"

487
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:16,460
"This birth isn't enough
to relish all this beauty!"

488
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,460
"Love without troubles!
Lust without boundaries!"

489
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,700
"In search of a lady, I went
and it was you, I found!"

490
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:10,420
"Art of speaking in riddles
isn't really my thing!"

491
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,820
"I expressed my wild desires..."

492
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,420
"...only to be called a child by you!"

493
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,740
"Timid, shy or innocent,
I am surely not!"

494
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,220
"I soared to reach the peak"

495
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,420
"In awe, you watched!"

496
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:29,580
"This love cannot be understood by humans
for it is not human!"

497
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:34,300
"Beyond the big blue yonder, let's go!
O love, would you come along?"

498
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,180
"O my darling..."

499
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,060
"O sweetheart!"

500
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:57,860
The minute you started singing...

501
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,740
...I was swept off my feet!

502
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,180
Full credit goes to him

503
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,380
- I love Gangai Amaran!
- Me, too

504
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,620
There is another song of his!
It goes like this!

505
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,140
This is Paramu
Can you come to the station right away?

506
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,820
I have to go

507
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,620
- Duty calls!
- Okay!

508
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:23,060
Welcome back, Shiva

509
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,380
- How did the bouquet get here?
- No idea!

510
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,780
P has sent this!

511
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,820
He should know better
than to mess with a cop!

512
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,780
We will take him down!

513
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,460
I have to get hold of him today!

514
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,700
P's henchman called me today
and gave me a lot of information about him!

515
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,460
He is ready to turn in
as an informant, too!

516
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,220
An informant, huh?
What else?

517
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,700
What did he say? Who is P?
Tell me in his own words!

518
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:57,500
He said it started ten years ago!
He wasn't even a biggie then!

519
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:02,020
He came in as a school boy
and grew into a don, courtesy his brother

520
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:05,820
The ones who teased him earlier
started respecting him!

521
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,300
A bike went missing in his area!
So he killed someone for that

522
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,500
He became a little popular then!
Something about 'cock fights' too

523
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,820
He went to Bombay, too!
It didn't work out, so he returned!

524
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,780
He is the biggest VIP in our area
We can't touch him!

525
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,740
I know how to touch him and squish him!
He can't escape from me

526
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,140
The vehicle will be here any minute
Stay alert!

527
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,620
Why are they filling the bathtub
with blood?

528
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,540
You are new
You have no idea

529
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,380
P always takes bath in blood

530
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,300
Mr. P, you may bathe
Everything is ready!

531
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,060
- Do you want me to stay?
- Not today!

532
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:55,820
- Why did you do this?
- P, you raped my sister!

533
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,260
That's why I ratted
you out to the cops

534
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:02,940
I raped their sisters too!
Did they mind?

535
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,780
It is time for you to go!

536
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,620
No, P. Don't do it!
Don't!

537
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,660
Did he find my hideout?

538
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,380
Rithika, don't!
Please!

539
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,420
Listen to me!

540
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,540
"I shall seek you out
to give you a hug!"

541
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,860
"Leap forth and stick
to you like glue!"

542
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,860
"Wrap around you like a nuptial thread
Oh yeah!"

543
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,460
"Collide against you, I shall!"

544
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,940
"Rip you in half, I will!"

545
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:52,860
"Bear this crime in my heart, I will
Oh yeah!"

546
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:17,740
The fire which you lit...

547
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,540
...is going to engulf you!

548
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:26,380
Your deeds are waiting
to weed you out!

549
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,420
Who are you?
Your voice is hoarse, have some tea!

550
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:33,900
Don't you know who I am?
Someone you spared!

551
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,660
I have come to finish you!

552
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,340
My name is P

553
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,980
I have another name: Pandiya!

554
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:49,660
Felt the tremor, didn't you?

555
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,460
Nothing of that sort!

556
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:54,780
Got a message from Swiggy
Lunch is here!

557
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,420
- Don't show off!
- I will!

558
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:02,020
I killed the guy who
ratted me out!

559
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,260
A bomb is going to go
off at noon tomorrow

560
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:06,620
Don't know how many
are going to die!

561
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,660
Stop it if you can!

562
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,380
Hey!
Why are you doing this?

563
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:10,540
I'm the villain, man!

564
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,860
- What is he saying?
- Says he is the villain

565
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,140
Then, it's fine!

566
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,860
Tell me!
Where is the bomb?

567
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:22,860
- What is he saying?
- He has placed a bomb in the city!

568
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:27,180
- He will do what he says!
- Do you know anyone who is linked to P?

569
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,100
There is a man who
is linked to P

570
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:30,620
How do you know him?

571
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,260
Because his name is Wasim Khan!

572
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:49,020
Shall I tell you a story?

573
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,380
You don't have to

574
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,620
Tell me where the bomb
is going off tomorrow

575
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:57,140
Did you actually think
these things will scare me?

576
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,460
- Know what 'Veeram' (courage) is?
- Yes, I do

577
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,740
Pretending to have
no fear, right?

578
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,860
No. It's living with younger
siblings in the village

579
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:07,380
Helping them in their
hour of need

580
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:11,380
- Know what 'Vivegam' (prudence) is?
- Yes

581
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:14,020
Working out in a Bulgarian
forest, right?

582
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:16,700
No. It is using your
intelligence, to succeed in life

583
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:18,380
Hey! What the hell, man?

584
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:20,260
You keep switching
the answers!

585
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,060
Why are you telling me this?

586
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,300
Until you tell me
where that bomb is...

587
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,460
...I'll pointlessly blabber
about, like this!

588
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,060
That bomb will go
off tomorrow!

589
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,500
You can't stop it!

590
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,220
- Isn't it wrong to kill innocents?
- No!

591
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,260
It isn't wrong to
kill any Indian!

592
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,260
Today, an explosion in Chennai

593
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,980
Tomorrow, in Hyderabad

594
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,300
Day after that, in Mumbai!

595
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,900
Here on in, India will have
an explosion every day!

596
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,180
We won't stop until we
destroy this country!

597
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,100
India is my motherland!
Ponnatha is my mother!

598
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,300
My motherland means
more to me than my mother!

599
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,620
I won't stand by and
watch it be destroyed!

600
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,820
Only to you, is India a motherland!

601
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,860
I'm from Pakistan!

602
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,180
India...is my enemy!

603
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,500
India isn't your enemy!
She's your aunt, man!

604
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:15,460
You see India as an enemy
I see Pakistan as my mom's sister!

605
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,180
Biriyani is our family food, man!

606
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:18,780
You're my aunt's son, man!

607
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,060
We both are cousins

608
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,620
In spite of everything, I said,
if that bomb has to go off, so be it

609
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,100
Those who are to die,
are your own aunt's children

610
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:32,500
By saying, kith and kin have gone nuts,
the Chinese will insult you!

611
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,900
Do you deserve that?

612
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:35,780
Do you deserve that, Wasim?

613
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,220
Get up

614
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,020
Please forgive me, brother!

615
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:45,500
Listening to the words of P
really poisoned my mind!

616
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:46,660
It's okay, Wasim Khan

617
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,620
He who forgives, is a man
He who asks forgiveness, is a greater man!

618
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:52,100
A great man once said
'You can neither run nor hide'

619
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,420
You asked for forgiveness
You are now a great man

620
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,220
Now tell me where the bomb is

621
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:03,420
I don't know the bomb's
exact location, bro

622
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:06,060
But, I do know a few code words

623
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,980
Using them, you must find the bomb

624
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:10,660
Code words?
Tell me, bro!

625
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,500
Bun Butter Jam

626
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,940
Sunny Leone

627
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,380
Virat Kohli

628
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,860
Egg bonda

629
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:18,580
Alright, brother

630
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,420
I'll take care of it
You get going

631
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:24,300
Tell aunt I said 'hi'

632
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,020
Just one more time, brother

633
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,420
Love you, bro

634
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:30,380
A case and information report
has been filed against him, sir

635
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,660
How can we release him?

636
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,780
A case? Here on in, even a speck
of dust shouldn't fall on him!

637
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,740
They've arrested Wasim Khan
He told them everything

638
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,300
Is that so?
Okay, I'll take care of it!

639
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:08,460
What gives, Wasim Khan?
Told them everything, eh?

640
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,460
Yes
I told them everything

641
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:12,820
Listen up, P

642
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,020
Nothing you're doing is right

643
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:17,500
India is your mother!
She is my aunt!

644
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,020
The one who will die as a result
of our blast, is our mother!

645
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,660
Brainwashed you too, did he?

646
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:27,140
Go ahead and hang up
I got this

647
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,460
Please don't do it, P!

648
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,940
Don't rush to that decision!

649
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,980
- My darling?
- Sir?

650
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,220
- Our old friend Wasim Khan?
- What do I do?

651
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,980
Call me after you do him in!

652
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,260
Bye

653
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,420
"I shall seek you out
to give you a hug!"

654
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,940
"Leap forth
and stick to you like glue!"

655
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,260
"Wrap around you like a nuptial thread
Oh yeah!"

656
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:17,620
Bun Butter Jam. Sunny Leone
Virat Kohli. Egg bonda

657
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,340
What do you intend to do
with these code words, Shiva?

658
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,700
I'm thinking about it, sir

659
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,780
Need to access
'Private Eye' mode for that!

660
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,060
Go ahead!

661
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:35,540
"You are a smart detective"

662
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:44,140
Come in, Shiva
Did you find it?

663
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,420
No, sir
'Private Eye' mode yielded nothing

664
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,780
Sorry for the disturbance, sir

665
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,980
On learning that Wasim Khan
flipped sides, P killed him!

666
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,180
How did P find out that Wasim Khan
became an informant?

667
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:02,580
We have a black sheep amongst us, sir!

668
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,620
You intend to find that black sheep?

669
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,820
I'll find him later!

670
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,180
For now,
we must stop that bomb!

671
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,100
I'll ask questions
Those who know the answers, speak up!

672
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:14,860
- What is in a Bun Butter Jam?
- Jam

673
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:17,540
- Sunny Leone's measurements?
- 40- 30- 40, sir!

674
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:18,580
Super

675
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:21,300
- The shape of an Egg Bonda?
- Like a cricket ball, sir!

676
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,700
- Total ODIs Virat Kohli has played?
- Anushka Sharma, sir!

677
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:26,220
I got it!

678
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,900
The 1C bus is going to blow up
at 2 PM in the Beach Road today!

679
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:30,700
We must stop it, sir!

680
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,980
How did you figure it out?

681
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:34,060
No time to discuss
Very complicated!

682
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:35,620
I'll return with that bomb!

683
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,980
Is this the Broadway bus depot?

684
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:40,180
- Yes, sir?
- Assistant Commissioner Shiva, here

685
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,940
Do not let the 1C bus leave!

686
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:42,980
That bus has a bomb!

687
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,460
What are you saying, sir?

688
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,860
It just left the bus depot!

689
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,780
Text me the driver's number!

690
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,860
- I'll send it, sir!
- Hurry!

691
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,940
You intend to call the bus driver,
have the passengers disembark...

692
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:05,060
...and save them all, huh?

693
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,780
Anticipating this move,
I set up a contingency plan!

694
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:11,740
The bus is moving at
5 kilometers per hour

695
00:51:11,780 --> 00:51:13,660
I've linked the bomb
to its accelerator

696
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,060
If the bus goes beyond
5 kilometers...

697
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,500
...it'll blow up automatically!

698
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:18,740
Save them if you can!

699
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,300
P, you rascal!

700
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,140
Stop yelling
and do your job!

701
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,340
- How's that?
- How's that?

702
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,980
Should you repeat whatever I do?
Keep massaging!

703
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,460
- Is this the driver of the 1C bus?
- Yes! Who are you?

704
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,580
Listen to me, carefully!

705
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,060
- Go on!
- Your bus has a bomb in it!

706
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,420
What? My bus has a bomb?

707
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,980
- No one there must know it. Got it?
- The bus has a bomb?

708
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,100
Drive faster than 5 kilometers,
it'll explode

709
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,500
- Stop the bus! Stop the bus!
- Okay, sir!

710
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,020
Don't panic!
If I stop, the bomb will explode!

711
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:52,900
Maintain the 5 kilometer speed

712
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,780
- I'm coming over there!
- Please hurry! I'm scared!

713
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,420
Out of the way, all of you!
Get away from here!

714
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:18,100
No one panic
I'll save you!

715
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,780
Very good

716
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,260
Intelligent citizens

717
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:30,620
I'll come now

718
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:06,300
- 'Kaun hai?' (Who is it?)
- I don't eat cone ice creams

719
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,980
- Is Inspector Inbasekar at home?
- Yes. What's up?

720
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:11,260
- Who is it, dear?
- He's asking for you

721
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:15,060
- 'Andhar jao' (Go inside)
- That's all the Hindi you know!

722
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,300
Let's talk upstairs

723
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,620
I know you're
the black sheep

724
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,180
Enticed by the alms
that P tossed at you...

725
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:34,940
...you fed him information
I'm well aware of that

726
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:39,780
If you wish for your wife and kids
to receive the pension due to you...

727
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,620
...admit it that you are the black sheep!

728
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:47,100
Do you know what that khaki uniform is?

729
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,180
Do you know what a cop is?
He who opposes and fights injustice...

730
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,620
...is a true cop!

731
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:54,740
Let me tell you something

732
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:56,580
Last week, Constable Manickam...

733
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,580
...eloped with a female cop

734
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:01,860
On the 16th day, after he took off...

735
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:03,460
...his son in pre- school...

736
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:08,580
...asked me about the kickbacks
that his dad had received!

737
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,660
How can our department respond to that?

738
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:21,100
Why do you never let me speak?

739
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,380
'It has come to our knowledge
that Assistant Commissioner Shiva'

740
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,580
'...was involved in the mysterious death
of Inspector Inbasekar'

741
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,620
He did the right thing

742
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,860
This is what will strike fear
among evildoers!

743
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,140
Excuse me

744
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,740
Oh no!
This guy will skewer me!

745
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:44,220
Who gave you the right
to take the law into your hands?

746
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:46,580
He was an associate of P!
How can we spare him?

747
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:49,660
I can't listen to what you have to say
As of now, you are suspended!

748
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,340
Hand over everything and leave

749
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,940
So, is this your final decision?

750
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,060
Yes

751
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:03,020
Your gun, sir

752
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:17,420
"Is this life but only a short tale?"

753
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:20,260
They asked us to collect your uniform, sir

754
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:26,660
"Comes to an end, does this path?"

755
00:56:29,180 --> 00:56:33,900
"Such a test in the life of a warrior?"

756
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:40,900
"Waves cloud the eyes of justice?"

757
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:47,580
"Don't go, Oh warrior!"

758
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:58,460
Tell me, Bharath

759
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,220
Turn on the Star Movies channel, buddy!

760
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,980
- Why?
- Just turn it on! You'll see

761
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:09,020
'Hello, my dear children!'

762
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,140
You've been named
the best psychiatric doctor this year

763
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,140
How do you feel about that?

764
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:18,940
To be honest,
this is a huge surprise to me!

765
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,100
This isn't a job
It's a penance!

766
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,940
If only every doctor was like you!

767
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:26,020
Who would you call an inspiration in life?

768
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:29,020
My inspiration, is my fiancé Shiva

769
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:33,300
I know how happy he must be,
if he's watching this right now

770
00:57:39,220 --> 00:57:40,780
So, Ramya is not a loony?

771
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,900
Everything is gonna be alright

772
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:49,060
- Look into this, sister
- Yes, doctor

773
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,940
What brings you here?

774
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,300
Are you a doctor?

775
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,420
Are you a loony?

776
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:56,900
Asking such a question
despite knowing I'm a doctor?

777
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,900
Thinking you were a loony, I loved you!
You deceived me, right?

778
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,180
What are you saying?

779
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,620
I beg of you

780
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,940
- Please let me go!
- Shiva!

781
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,900
Hold on, Shiva!

782
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:17,940
What happened to you, Shiva?
What's your problem?

783
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:20,140
Pretended to be a loony
and deceived me, yeah?

784
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,300
When did I ever
pretend to be a loony?

785
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,140
That's what it seemed like, Ramya!

786
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,740
You chase puppies down streets!

787
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:29,300
You eat ice creams in the rain!
You help a good director cross the street!

788
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,420
You wear a T-shirt saying 'Crazy Heart'
and board a mental hospital bus!

789
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:34,100
What else was I supposed to think?

790
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,900
What am I to do,
if you misunderstood things?

791
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:41,900
Marrying a loony girl has been my dream!
My desire! My ambition! My everything!

792
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:43,460
- You ruined that for me!
- Shiva...

793
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,940
Please leave me alone!

794
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:55,220
The job of a cop which I loved,
was no longer with me

795
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,660
Neither was the woman I loved

796
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,180
Life was tremendously boring!

797
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:01,300
Was thinking whether I must find
another job or woo another girl

798
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,780
Despite drinking 7 shots,
I didn't get high

799
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:06,820
I got pissed at life and at the booze

800
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:09,100
But I kept it together
and had another round

801
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:12,180
Hey Shiva!
Get out here!

802
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,300
- Who is that?
- What are you doing?

803
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:18,300
Welcome, O favorite son of Tamil!

804
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,100
Welcome, O son-in-law of my mom!

805
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,220
Way to go, sister!

806
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:22,900
Who do you think you are?

807
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:26,900
Chase us around in the name of love!
Constantly say you're in love with us!

808
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:30,980
Belittle us cause we're not loony
or fair skinned?

809
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,980
Think we'll just let that go?

810
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,780
I demand justice!

811
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,940
Hey! Causing a ruckus
after drinking fruit sherbet, huh?

812
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:41,220
What else? You expect us to booze
and create nuisance?

813
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:44,700
- We're from decent families!
- Please leave. Or I'll call the cops!

814
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:49,420
You yourself are a cop, man!
How can you turn us over to the cops?

815
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,860
"Who gave birth to you?"

816
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:01,500
"If I ever get my hands on her,
she is dead meat!"

817
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,940
"Beat the snot out of him!"

818
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,340
"Kick his sorry ass!"

819
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:08,700
"Chop him up in pieces!"

820
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,300
"I don't need him at all!"

821
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,780
[Mallya Sherbet Stall]

822
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:21,100
"Who gave birth to you?
- Gave birth to you?"

823
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:24,940
"If I ever get my hands on her,
she is dead meat!"

824
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,660
"Outside, right now!"

825
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:51,980
"You need us for your petty expenses!"

826
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:54,460
"You need us to make out with you!"

827
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:59,060
"You need us to show off to the world
that you have a girlfriend!"

828
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:01,580
"Why the heck do you love?
Why do you love, you idiot?"

829
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,980
"Why in blazes do you love?
Why on earth do you love?"

830
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:06,420
"Whenever I am with you..."

831
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:09,020
"...you try hitting on my friend,
you pig!"

832
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:13,420
"So, why lecture me about the sanctity
of virginity, you doofus?"

833
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:18,180
"You men are all donkeys,
who wish to control and rule over us!"

834
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:23,380
"Are us womenfolk monkeys,
to dance to your tunes?"

835
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,500
Bull-shit!

836
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,620
"Beat the snot out of him!"

837
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:30,020
"Kick his sorry ass!"

838
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,300
"Chop him up in pieces!"

839
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:35,500
"I don't need him at all!"

840
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:38,980
"Who gave birth to you?"

841
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:43,460
"If I ever get my hands on her,
she is dead meat!"

842
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:59,220
"You ruin your life
by smoking and drinking!"

843
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:04,020
"Must I waste my life,
by repeatedly trying to reform you?"

844
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:06,540
"Why the heck do you love?
Why do you love you idiot?"

845
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:08,980
"Why in blazes do you love?
Why on earth do you love?"

846
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:13,660
"Under the excuse of love failure,
you throw acid at us!"

847
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:18,300
"So, how dare you talk shamelessly to us
about your rightful rage?"

848
01:02:18,940 --> 01:02:21,060
"If you ever leave me..."

849
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:23,100
"...it is not my loss!"

850
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:28,500
"For your ugly face,
no girl in town will ever fall for you!"

851
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:29,940
"Beat it!"

852
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:32,700
"Beat the snot out of him!"

853
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,900
"Kick his sorry ass!"

854
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,660
"Chop him up in pieces!"

855
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,060
"I don't need him at all!"

856
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:46,980
"Be well, dear fellow"

857
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:52,580
"Wherever you are,
be well, dear fellow!"

858
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,460
A tribute!

859
01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:58,140
"Those who slept through
beautiful mornings..."

860
01:02:58,180 --> 01:02:59,980
"...ruined the country..."

861
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,540
So many flowers in the tea!

862
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,500
How many times did I
tell you to move shop?

863
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,420
Why do you get so
tense in the morning?

864
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:06,660
Just relax, dude!

865
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:08,740
She comes over at night
and sings horrifically!

866
01:03:08,780 --> 01:03:10,580
The fault is hers!
Why does she scold me?

867
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,620
Buddy...

868
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,060
Think about this long and hard

869
01:03:14,100 --> 01:03:16,980
Did she ever once claim to you
that she was a loony?

870
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:20,620
What can she do,
if you misunderstood things?

871
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,500
We go to the wine shop
to drink beer

872
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,220
But the beer we wish, is unavailable

873
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:25,820
Even if it's there, it's not cold

874
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,900
Don't we have brandy during such times?
Such is life!

875
01:03:28,980 --> 01:03:30,180
Dude...

876
01:03:30,460 --> 01:03:32,420
You expected her to have two things

877
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:34,180
She has only one of them

878
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:35,660
Can't you live with it?

879
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,900
I think you get it
But there is one thing

880
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,100
It was wrong of us to skip
college today for him!

881
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:41,580
We have practicals today, too!

882
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:46,420
After speaking to my friends,
things got much clearer for me

883
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:48,340
Deciding to love
Ramya again

884
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:50,540
 I went home, with a
non-stop voiceover

885
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:14,300
Why is there a 'To Let' board
in the house upstairs?

886
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:17,260
They vacated the house
and left for America!

887
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:22,580
Why are you sad?

888
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,860
It's not like she's dead, right?

889
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,460
She's just gone to America!

890
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,340
There you go!

891
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:31,580
America is just right here!

892
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:33,700
It's barely a stone's throw away!

893
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:35,700
Granny! That's Australia!

894
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:38,820
They all look the same
Never mind!

895
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:40,220
You get going!

896
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:42,780
Must I go so far just for love?

897
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,780
I'm not saying that you must go

898
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,820
Just saying it will be great if you did

899
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:47,940
Think about it

900
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:49,820
Alright, I thought about it

901
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,140
I'm going to America!

902
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:55,900
You messed up, again
That's Africa

903
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,340
- Purpose of visit
- Love

904
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,060
See my guitar

905
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:18,780
Welcome to America

906
01:05:19,260 --> 01:05:20,980
"Raindrops that flood the heart..."

907
01:05:23,820 --> 01:05:25,260
Establishing shot of New York, eh?

908
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:28,220
The city has parks, the Pentagon Building
and Trump Tower!

909
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,260
Hell, there's even my cousin's house!

910
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:32,300
But you won't show any of that,
will you?

911
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,180
All the time, plonking it right here!

912
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,060
After freshening up
once I reached America...

913
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:39,740
...I went immediately
to Central Park

914
01:05:39,780 --> 01:05:42,620
The watchman at the park,
told me she'd definitely come here

915
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,220
He's a Madurai guy!

916
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,700
I waited for Ramya

917
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,380
While I was there, an uncle came by

918
01:05:52,100 --> 01:05:55,100
My uncle once told me that
life is like a box of chocolates

919
01:05:56,060 --> 01:05:57,420
My aunt told me...

920
01:05:57,500 --> 01:06:00,460
...that eating too many chocolates
leads to tooth decay

921
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:06,020
Forget what my aunt said
Take some!

922
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,700
Life is like a box of chocolates

923
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,860
"Sing really loudly, we shall!"

924
01:06:30,980 --> 01:06:33,940
"That's not all we can do!"

925
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:37,140
"What we sing is in Malayalam!"

926
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:40,620
"Why do we do so?
We have no clue!"

927
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:46,980
"Outside of these two lines,
we know no more Malayalam!"

928
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:53,620
"When asked to sing about this,
we shall sing in Tamil itself!"

929
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:01,380
Why did you come here?

930
01:07:02,980 --> 01:07:05,980
I felt like being with you
To fall in love with you again

931
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:07,540
Felt we must not lose this life

932
01:07:08,860 --> 01:07:10,500
Weren't you the one who left me?

933
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:13,420
You were the one who rejected me
What has changed?

934
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:15,740
You're not in my heart anymore
It's over

935
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:19,020
No matter how overboard we go,
don't we booze up the right next day?

936
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:21,780
- Please understand!
- Sorry. I've stopped drinking

937
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:25,140
Leave me alone
You're not in my heart anymore!

938
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:30,140
"O my darling..."

939
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:35,900
"O sweetheart!"

940
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:45,980
"O my darling..."

941
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,020
"O sweetheart!"

942
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,300
Music is love

943
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:01,460
I love Gangai Amaran

944
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:23,940
Okay, you get going

945
01:08:24,020 --> 01:08:24,980
I'll see you tonight

946
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:26,660
What happened?
Where are you going?

947
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:28,700
No time to discuss that
It's complicated

948
01:08:35,980 --> 01:08:36,980
Welcome, sir

949
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,580
What is this?
We're undercover!

950
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,420
Won't the public be suspicious?
Know how careful we are at home?

951
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,220
- I am sorry, sir
- It's okay

952
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,460
Don't do this again

953
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:49,820
- You must be Anderson, right?
- Yes. How did you know?

954
01:08:49,860 --> 01:08:51,300
It's my instinct

955
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:53,900
- Let's go
- Okay, sir

956
01:09:00,820 --> 01:09:02,900
I thought America had
left side driving?

957
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:05,100
We changed it for
your convenience

958
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:06,260
Good

959
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:13,340
Have you reached, Shiva?

960
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:16,620
Yes, sir. It's been 5 minutes
Angelina picked me up

961
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:19,340
Per our plan, finish
the job at hand

962
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:20,420
Yes, sir!

963
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:22,020
You're confused, right?

964
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:25,260
A week ago,
I got a phone call from America

965
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,340
A foreign number

966
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,860
This is Agent Angelina

967
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:35,300
Sorry, Angelina
I already have an LIC policy

968
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,260
I'm not an LIC agent
I'm an FBI agent

969
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:41,300
Oh tell me

970
01:09:41,340 --> 01:09:46,020
I was told that you are handling the case
of the International terrorist leader P

971
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:49,060
As the part of investigation
I've come to Malaysia

972
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:53,260
Now P has organised
a meeting in America

973
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:56,660
To world's most wanted criminals
will attend that meeting

974
01:09:56,740 --> 01:09:58,380
If you come to America...

975
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,580
...we can capture them immediately

976
01:10:00,820 --> 01:10:02,780
The FBI needs your help

977
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,140
Okay

978
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,620
Can you tell me where this meeting
is set to take place?

979
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,820
No, I can't tell you over the phone

980
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:10,540
It's highly confidential

981
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:13,060
- Can you WhatsApp me the details?
- Sorry, Shiva

982
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,140
Please come to America immediately

983
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,580
- And I'll tell you
- Okay, Angelina

984
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:19,540
I'll come to America

985
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:20,820
Okay

986
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:25,580
To capture P, the Commissioner and I
crafted a plan with the FBI

987
01:10:26,100 --> 01:10:27,860
He pretended to suspend me

988
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:31,300
Claiming I'd come to America
to reclaim my love, I arrived secretly

989
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:32,860
That's what happened

990
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,780
Now watch without any confusion

991
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:44,500
Hope you remember

992
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:46,540
Is the weapons team I
asked for, all set?

993
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:47,700
Yes!

994
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,860
Stop the car...car

995
01:11:04,580 --> 01:11:06,100
Have them dig over there

996
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,260
Why?

997
01:11:08,140 --> 01:11:10,820
My instinct says you'll find
a lot of dead bodies there

998
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:14,500
This is a cemetery, Shiva
It's bound to have dead bodies!

999
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:25,820
Okay, let's go

1000
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:27,100
Don't waste time

1001
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:35,340
Now tell me, Angelina
Where is the meeting set to occur?

1002
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:38,340
Through one of my sources
I got the location of this meeting

1003
01:11:38,380 --> 01:11:39,620
But the file is encrypted

1004
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,700
We still working on decoding it

1005
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:44,260
Behind every smartphone,
is an iron screen

1006
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,900
With that and the Aadhar card...

1007
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,340
...they even track the underwear
you bought last week!

1008
01:11:48,380 --> 01:11:50,700
The calls you attend
The texts you send

1009
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:53,460
The porn you watch
Someone's always watching!

1010
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,420
Be careful

1011
01:11:54,460 --> 01:11:56,220
Shiva, who are you talking to?

1012
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:57,860
To my people

1013
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,380
Give me the phone

1014
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:05,820
I got it

1015
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:08,740
The meeting will take place
at Casino hotel at 11 PM

1016
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,420
How did you figure it out?

1017
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,220
There's no time to discuss that
Let's go!

1018
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,740
"This is the Inn"

1019
01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:23,580
"Hold your breath and count to ten"

1020
01:12:25,220 --> 01:12:29,740
"Feel the earth movement"

1021
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:35,620
"Heal my heart burst"

1022
01:12:41,060 --> 01:12:44,660
Vodka martini
Shaken, not stirred

1023
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:50,900
I'm scared

1024
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,220
Don't be afraid

1025
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:55,740
I've ordered drinks
Two rounds should make it better

1026
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:57,900
Stop kidding around, Shiva!

1027
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,660
Observe carefully

1028
01:13:01,660 --> 01:13:04,060
It's Mr. Shiva! Shall
we get an autograph?

1029
01:13:04,100 --> 01:13:05,700
After they wrap up filming!

1030
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:07,060
Be casual

1031
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,940
We're being watched

1032
01:13:10,140 --> 01:13:11,940
- Thank you
- You are welcome

1033
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:13,940
- Cheers
- Cheers

1034
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:19,020
How long must I wait?

1035
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,220
Will P be here or not?

1036
01:13:21,260 --> 01:13:23,180
They told me that he's almost here

1037
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:24,820
Hold on
Let me go check

1038
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:32,700
- What happened?
- P will be here in 2 minutes

1039
01:13:33,660 --> 01:13:35,100
- In what car?
- A limousine

1040
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:36,900
Okay
Come to the lobby

1041
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:42,420
I'll be back
Order another round for me, too

1042
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:45,380
Bro?

1043
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,860
Got any spicy savouries, bro?

1044
01:13:46,900 --> 01:13:48,220
This is Anti-American

1045
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:49,820
You are all Anti-Americans

1046
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:51,660
How long must I wait for one man?

1047
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,020
What's happening here?

1048
01:13:53,540 --> 01:13:55,500
Why do you hold mic sets, idiots?

1049
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,460
What are you doing here?

1050
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:59,500
They said they would give some food

1051
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:02,380
- My apologies
- Get out, all of you!

1052
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:06,300
P has arrived

1053
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,500
Where are you, Anderson?
Yeah, I see you

1054
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:10,980
Now we can talk in person

1055
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:43,420
'Sathyaraj Halwa Shop!'

1056
01:14:45,780 --> 01:14:47,020
Go and arrest the rest!

1057
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,180
Whatever it is,
we'll talk at the precinct!

1058
01:15:01,540 --> 01:15:03,300
Tell me where you are, P!

1059
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,220
You hatched a plan to kill me

1060
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,660
But, I made sure you rejoined
the police force...

1061
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,100
...and had you arrest
every terrorist leader!

1062
01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:15,820
By using you, I've now become
the greatest terrorist leader in the world!

1063
01:15:15,900 --> 01:15:18,100
You will always be number two!

1064
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,060
Don't talk filthy!

1065
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:24,380
You may have gotten away this time
But, I will capture you!

1066
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,300
Never mind capturing me!

1067
01:15:26,700 --> 01:15:28,460
Save your girlfriend if you can!

1068
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,020
What's wrong?
Looking for her over there?

1069
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,620
She's in my custody!

1070
01:15:37,660 --> 01:15:41,140
I came where you set a trap for me
and captured your girlfriend!

1071
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:44,020
Now tell me who's the better man?
Me or you?

1072
01:15:44,860 --> 01:15:46,180
Don't you hurt her!

1073
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:55,140
Oh God!

1074
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,300
Laughing, are you?

1075
01:16:00,620 --> 01:16:02,620
Your death will be at my hands!

1076
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,420
I'm waiting

1077
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:24,580
Shiva!
Save me, Shiva! Please!

1078
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,580
I won't stop until I destroy you, P!

1079
01:16:26,740 --> 01:16:28,660
Your death will be at my hands!

1080
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:33,420
'The brutal murder of Ramya, a doctor,
who was kidnapped by terrorists...'

1081
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,060
'...has sent shockwaves worldwide'

1082
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:40,340
'Police officer Shiva and Dr. Ramya
were very good friends'

1083
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:43,380
'When they were doomed to be stuck
in the friend zone forever...'

1084
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,380
'...such a horrific event occurred'

1085
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:49,820
'This incident has created quite a stir
amongst couples who mingle as friends'

1086
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,340
I know what you're going to say

1087
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,940
About my kid needing
a mom, right?

1088
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:57,580
Yes

1089
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:58,860
I'll think about it

1090
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:02,220
Can you take me to Ramya's grave?

1091
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,340
- Why?
- Take me there and I'll tell you

1092
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:05,380
Okay

1093
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:07,020
Move aside!

1094
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,540
- Do what I say!
- Listen to me. Don't go there!

1095
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:11,260
Step back!

1096
01:17:11,300 --> 01:17:12,780
Don't push me, sir!

1097
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,620
Granny!
Why did you make those 3 vows?

1098
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:25,220
In order to fulfill the deepest
dreams of my heart!

1099
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:26,340
What are those?

1100
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:30,420
First, you must mercilessly kill
the man who murdered Ramya!

1101
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:34,300
Next, you must marry someone
much prettier than Ramya!

1102
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:38,540
Finally, with her, you must give me
a beautiful grandson!

1103
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:40,540
Give me your hand

1104
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:43,100
I swear to fulfill
all of your desires!

1105
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:44,180
Splendid!

1106
01:17:44,300 --> 01:17:46,860
- Let's go
- You go ahead

1107
01:17:46,940 --> 01:17:48,500
Let me meditate for a while

1108
01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:50,260
I'll go and get the 'idlies' ready

1109
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:14,380
- Just one question, sir! Please!
- Just a minute, sir!

1110
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:17,980
What was the goal of this meditation?
What are you trying to say?

1111
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:19,220
'The Righteous War'

1112
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:21,220
Perfect. You always say that,
but you'll reunite!

1113
01:18:21,260 --> 01:18:22,540
Mr. Rajnikanth's film

1114
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,380
It's airing today
Watch and enjoy!

1115
01:18:24,580 --> 01:18:25,660
Good day

1116
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:28,620
Like we get to know what's on TV
only through him!

1117
01:18:28,980 --> 01:18:30,220
Get going!

1118
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:39,300
Learnt that you just managed
to woo Ramya after dedicated efforts!

1119
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,100
This shouldn't have happened to you

1120
01:18:42,980 --> 01:18:44,180
How do you plan to kill P?

1121
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:47,900
If you want to destroy someone,
destroy their power first. Then, end him!

1122
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:51,140
- What is P's power?
- Well, it is a circle

1123
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:53,220
- In the middle of it...
- Who are you?

1124
01:18:53,820 --> 01:18:55,780
I was told
it was time for an item song

1125
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:58,100
Oh? It's time for that already?

1126
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,540
- Carry on
- Thank you

1127
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,180
- In that square...
- Ready, Kalyan?

1128
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,500
"Come forth, O god of lust!"

1129
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:25,340
"Is there any man who's righteous?"

1130
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:28,700
"It is a sin to kill!"

1131
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:31,380
"Redeemed, you will be,
if you eat to your fill!"

1132
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:35,100
"A bud is trembling
on the creeper!"

1133
01:19:35,180 --> 01:19:38,260
"Won't a single caress
make the bud bloom?"

1134
01:19:38,300 --> 01:19:41,860
"Won't you come to compose tunes
on my waist?"

1135
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,260
"O my Casanova!"

1136
01:19:44,300 --> 01:19:46,740
"Come forth, O god of lust!"

1137
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:49,540
"Is there any man who's righteous?"

1138
01:20:26,620 --> 01:20:29,540
"A hundred kinds of pleasure
to be relished"

1139
01:20:29,620 --> 01:20:32,660
"The end of purpose
to be reached"

1140
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,460
"Why do you fear?
Come along!"

1141
01:20:35,540 --> 01:20:37,380
"O my fiery warrior!"

1142
01:20:38,540 --> 01:20:41,460
"Do we need the barrier of an attire?"

1143
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:44,740
"Watch me fulfill your commands,
O master!"

1144
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:47,660
"Who is she?
A sweet flower child"

1145
01:20:47,740 --> 01:20:49,340
"A rainbow rose!"

1146
01:20:50,180 --> 01:20:51,460
"Let me melt!"

1147
01:20:53,060 --> 01:20:54,660
"Savour the honey!"

1148
01:20:56,020 --> 01:20:59,460
"All just for you,
O majesty!"

1149
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:01,420
"A delightful doll, I am!"

1150
01:21:02,380 --> 01:21:04,620
"Eternal intoxication, I am!"

1151
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:47,300
"The river of desire,
we shall cross!"

1152
01:21:47,380 --> 01:21:50,340
"Even God Almighty
can join in!"

1153
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:53,300
"Shall I slather myself..."

1154
01:21:53,340 --> 01:21:55,380
"...all over your heart?"

1155
01:21:56,300 --> 01:21:59,180
"As much as it can,
will the body live!"

1156
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:02,300
"For all of eternity,
will lust thrive!"

1157
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:07,740
"Dew drops fall upon this union
like drops from a lyre!"

1158
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:09,220
"Embrace me, won't you?"

1159
01:22:10,740 --> 01:22:12,540
"Exuberance of taste, it will be!"

1160
01:22:13,740 --> 01:22:17,060
"A slithering silk attire, I am!"

1161
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,140
"An orchard of jasmines, I am!"

1162
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:21,980
"Cupid's play, I am!"

1163
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,980
What you say is all well and good

1164
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:33,220
But, what is the plan?

1165
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:36,740
P is showing off
'cause he's got 1 lakh crore rupees

1166
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:39,780
If we declare that money invalid,
he'll surrender to us!

1167
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,460
Shall I arrange a raid right away?

1168
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:44,180
No, sir. Raids would be sensational
only on those days

1169
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:46,660
The next day, it'll fizzle out
I have another plan!

1170
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:50,580
Dear friend!

1171
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:51,460
My friend!

1172
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,780
Tell me, Shiva!
How can I help you?

1173
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:55,740
Listen carefully to what I say

1174
01:22:57,660 --> 01:23:00,780
A dead friend of mine is calling me!
Please hold, sir!

1175
01:23:01,380 --> 01:23:03,020
Tomorrow is Bharath's wedding!

1176
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:04,820
Don't forget it amidst your work
Be there!

1177
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,060
Forget that!
You died! How are you calling me?

1178
01:23:07,100 --> 01:23:09,340
There's no time to discuss that now

1179
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:11,420
Come to the wedding
We'll talk then!

1180
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,260
Sorry, sir
A dead friend of mine just called!

1181
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:17,660
That's why I made you wait

1182
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:19,620
Tell me, Shiva
What do I do?

1183
01:23:24,020 --> 01:23:27,020
I can't explain it now, sir
It's complicated. Can you do it for me?

1184
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:29,180
I'll do anything for you!

1185
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:31,060
- Thank you
- I'll definitely do it!

1186
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,620
- This is too much, man!
- I don't follow

1187
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:34,980
Brilliant idea

1188
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:40,420
The ISIPS have informed that
Shiva has crafted a plan to destroy you

1189
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:44,860
If someone's planning to end me...

1190
01:23:44,900 --> 01:23:47,900
...I would use the same plan
to create their own obituary poster!

1191
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:51,380
You're supposed to say this to hype me up!
I'm forced to do it myself

1192
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,980
Call my precious!

1193
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:58,060
My dear! See to it you do
Assistant Commissioner Shiva!

1194
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,660
- Really, sir?
- Stop it!

1195
01:23:59,700 --> 01:24:01,060
I meant do him in!
Idiot!

1196
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:04,660
Alright, sir

1197
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:09,340
Not here, man

1198
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:11,020
Hold it there and play!

1199
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:14,860
Why play in a deserted area?

1200
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:16,420
You could rather play at home!

1201
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:17,900
Have him comb his hair first!

1202
01:24:47,900 --> 01:24:50,540
"O rugged fighter!"

1203
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:53,420
"Those piercing eyes..."

1204
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:56,820
"...seeks out two souls!"

1205
01:25:08,180 --> 01:25:10,020
This letter just arrived from Rithika

1206
01:25:13,140 --> 01:25:14,860
Why such a drastic change, Rithika?

1207
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,980
- Forgive me P
- For what?

1208
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:19,100
Per your request,
I went to kill Shiva

1209
01:25:19,140 --> 01:25:22,500
Despite being born as a girl,
I had no clue about femininity for years

1210
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:27,220
To a henchwoman like me, Shiva showed
what femininity was and how soft it is!

1211
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,140
Imbecile!

1212
01:25:28,180 --> 01:25:30,180
Now, I wish to wear
flowers on my head

1213
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,660
I wish to wear a sari!

1214
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:34,060
I wish to wear a big round dot
on my forehead!

1215
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:36,020
- I don't know why!
- I know why!

1216
01:25:36,060 --> 01:25:37,700
But, I like it

1217
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:41,580
Now on, I'm his slave. I don't know
if I can live together with him

1218
01:25:41,660 --> 01:25:44,860
But, by standing in some corner
and gazing at him, I'll live my life!

1219
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:46,100
Please forgive me

1220
01:25:46,140 --> 01:25:48,260
I can't work as your
henchwoman anymore

1221
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:49,580
Yours truly,
Rithika

1222
01:25:51,060 --> 01:25:53,620
Shiva!
You took my girl from me, eh?

1223
01:25:53,660 --> 01:25:55,060
I won't spare you!

1224
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,460
Why get married at such a young age?

1225
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:01,940
I just started college, dude

1226
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:05,100
I repeatedly told my parents
that I didn't want to marry right now

1227
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,620
I'm doing this
because they compelled me!

1228
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,340
- Congratulations, Mr. Groom!
- Thank you

1229
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,060
You guys go ahead and eat!

1230
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:18,740
Don't we get a party, buddy?

1231
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:20,260
- What?
- Booze

1232
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:24,060
Knowing you'd ask me this, I fixed
my wedding on an 'abstinence' holiday!

1233
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:26,260
Just go and eat 'pongal' and 'vadai'

1234
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:28,460
Hey! How did you come
back from the dead?

1235
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:31,820
Don't talk about inauspicious things
at a wedding! No time to discuss, now!

1236
01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:34,780
Today's your second
night, right?

1237
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:35,660
Yes!

1238
01:26:57,140 --> 01:26:59,180
Buddy!
It's Ramya!

1239
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:01,100
That's not Ramya
It's Gayathri

1240
01:27:01,140 --> 01:27:03,100
- A close friend of the bride
- No!

1241
01:27:03,460 --> 01:27:04,740
That's Ramya!

1242
01:27:04,780 --> 01:27:06,620
Won't believe me, eh?
Come!

1243
01:27:06,900 --> 01:27:08,380
I'll introduce you both

1244
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:11,100
- What is it?
- Come here, dear

1245
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:13,180
- I'll catch up
- She's toast!

1246
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:15,900
He is my friend, Shiva
Assistant Commissioner of Police

1247
01:27:15,940 --> 01:27:18,060
You guys chat. I'll be back
Raghavan!

1248
01:27:18,100 --> 01:27:19,580
- Yes, Siddarth?
- Keep talking

1249
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:22,460
I love you

1250
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:25,580
Barely 2 minutes since you saw me

1251
01:27:25,620 --> 01:27:28,460
- How can you say that so quickly?
- I would've said it in 2 seconds

1252
01:27:28,500 --> 01:27:31,140
Thought you'd find it awkward
So, I waited 2 minutes

1253
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:35,020
Just because I'm a cop, don't assume
that I'll be stiff, strict and silent

1254
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:35,980
I talk a lot!

1255
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:39,100
I know. Didn't you stop
the riot in Melapakkam?

1256
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:43,260
You know quite a bit about me!
There's so much you don't know

1257
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,900
If you give your consent,
I will take very good care of you

1258
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:48,780
I'll be a complete husband,
at home, not a mere cop

1259
01:27:50,180 --> 01:27:52,020
This is too fast for me

1260
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:53,300
Look Gayatri

1261
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:56,100
This might be fast for you
To me, it is very slow!

1262
01:27:56,140 --> 01:27:57,820
Okay
If you don't want to, fine

1263
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:00,340
If not today,
can we get married tomorrow?

1264
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:09,460
They say there are 7 people
in the world, who look alike

1265
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:14,780
Only on that day, did I know
that they'd be of the same size and colour!

1266
01:28:14,860 --> 01:28:17,980
In that moment,
I felt that Ramya had come back to me

1267
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:19,900
I must stop talking to myself like this!

1268
01:28:20,060 --> 01:28:22,180
What is this, sir?
Time to tie the nuptial thread!

1269
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:25,100
The groom is not here!
What do I tell my daughter?

1270
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:27,500
Calm down, good sir
He wouldn't have gone anywhere

1271
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:28,980
Probably chatting with friends

1272
01:28:29,020 --> 01:28:30,420
He'll be here
Don't panic

1273
01:28:30,460 --> 01:28:33,300
When will he come?
Only 2 minutes left in the auspicious time!

1274
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:35,620
We searched the whole temple!
The groom is missing!

1275
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:38,180
You did this just because
I had no mother, right?

1276
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:41,380
Had mom been here,
would she have let this happen?

1277
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,860
This happens at every wedding
we go to, yes?

1278
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:45,900
Inspite of that, they keep doing it!

1279
01:28:46,820 --> 01:28:48,820
Your daughter must be wed now, yes?

1280
01:28:49,540 --> 01:28:51,340
I'll marry your daughter

1281
01:28:58,580 --> 01:29:00,260
You don't have to do anything!

1282
01:29:00,540 --> 01:29:02,780
Within the small gap of time
when I went to the loo...

1283
01:29:02,860 --> 01:29:04,860
...you try to commit
the heist of the century?

1284
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,700
No, man
Just wanted to give her a life

1285
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,020
You marry her yourself

1286
01:29:18,260 --> 01:29:19,820
- Note it down!
- It's invalid!

1287
01:29:19,860 --> 01:29:21,180
- It's valid!
- It's not!

1288
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:23,300
What's the matter?

1289
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:27,620
The Prime Minister just announced on TV,
that 500 and 1000 rupee notes are invalid!

1290
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:29,660
From now on, these notes
are null and void!

1291
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:31,020
He did it way too early!

1292
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:33,500
If it's invalid, must I use US dollars
as wedding presents?

1293
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:36,020
- Take it!
- I've repeatedly said it's invalid!

1294
01:29:40,060 --> 01:29:41,180
Go ahead, Shiva!

1295
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:42,780
The ban was set for tonight!

1296
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:46,940
Can't even provide wedding cash!
Huge problem here!

1297
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:48,420
Sorry, Shiva

1298
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:52,180
As he was going to Uzbekistan,
he announced it this morning

1299
01:29:52,260 --> 01:29:53,860
Your plan is working very well!

1300
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:55,580
The whole nation is abuzz!

1301
01:29:55,660 --> 01:29:57,820
P will come out into the open!

1302
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:58,940
We'll flush him out!

1303
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:37,180
Did you call me, sir?

1304
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,820
- Who are you, sir?
- I'm Mani, sir. Security

1305
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:41,980
Get out

1306
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:52,620
Money! Money! Money!

1307
01:30:52,660 --> 01:30:54,460
- Sir?
- Is your name 'Dhudu' (money), too?

1308
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:57,900
No. The Prime Minister just announced
that 500 and 1000 rupee notes are invalid

1309
01:30:57,940 --> 01:30:59,220
These are of no value now

1310
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:01,620
- When did he announce it?
- Just now, on TV

1311
01:31:02,660 --> 01:31:04,020
You, Shiva!

1312
01:31:05,500 --> 01:31:07,580
Your plan is working excellently, Shiva!

1313
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:09,900
P must definitely come outside
to visit an ATM!

1314
01:31:15,380 --> 01:31:16,620
It's P, sir!

1315
01:31:16,660 --> 01:31:18,060
Trace that call!

1316
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:23,180
You made a gazillion bucks of mine
invalid...

1317
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:27,180
...and made me stand outside an ATM
for 50 meagre bucks, eh? I won't spare you!

1318
01:31:27,220 --> 01:31:28,820
This is just a trailer, buddy

1319
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:31,740
You haven't seen the full film yet
It's horrifying!

1320
01:31:32,780 --> 01:31:36,380
Some horrible films have great trailers

1321
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:39,380
Some great films have horrible trailers

1322
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:41,660
Really? Give me an example

1323
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:43,900
'Quarter Cutting'!

1324
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:47,020
That film is horrible
and so is its trailer!

1325
01:31:47,060 --> 01:31:48,300
Tell me a good film!

1326
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:52,940
By asking for a film and its plot,
you're trying to trace my call, yes?

1327
01:31:53,020 --> 01:31:56,020
You're not understanding
my role at all, man! See you!

1328
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,300
Traced it?
- Yes

1329
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:02,020
He's opposite the ATM
near the Commissioner's office!

1330
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:03,540
Go fast

1331
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:05,060
Go, get him!

1332
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:07,740
How long must I wait here?

1333
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:10,740
Is it wrong to wait in a queue,
for the good of the nation?

1334
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:13,700
Long as there are fools like you,
they'll keep doing this stuff!

1335
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:19,260
Slight resemblance

1336
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:21,940
- Won't give me a penny!
- Bro!

1337
01:32:22,540 --> 01:32:24,220
Did anyone make a run for it, now?

1338
01:32:24,260 --> 01:32:24,860
Yes, sir

1339
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:26,940
One of them just got
away in a vehicle

1340
01:32:28,220 --> 01:32:29,580
What kind of vehicle?

1341
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:32,580
Sorry. I was busy at my job
Didn't notice

1342
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:36,220
Just answer my questions

1343
01:32:36,300 --> 01:32:38,020
I'll tell you what vehicle it is

1344
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:39,340
Go ahead, sir!

1345
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:43,460
Did the doors of that vehicle
open like this or open like that?

1346
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,980
It didn't open in either manner

1347
01:32:47,140 --> 01:32:48,660
Because it had no door!

1348
01:32:48,700 --> 01:32:49,700
Had no door?

1349
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,060
What kind of vehicle is that?

1350
01:32:52,100 --> 01:32:53,660
It was a two-wheeler, sir!

1351
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:54,660
Two- wheeler, huh?

1352
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:57,180
You look like someone
with a sharp memory!

1353
01:32:57,260 --> 01:33:02,820
- Do you know the vehicle's number?
- The number is 'TN-02 AM-6264'

1354
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:06,500
TN- 05 6264

1355
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:10,220
How can we watch this
without anyone's knowledge?

1356
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:13,300
Trace the motorcycle that P took
from the ATM!

1357
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,380
Give me a close-up of P's face!

1358
01:33:17,540 --> 01:33:18,780
Have a look, sir!

1359
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:21,660
How would he look like,
if he had a beard?

1360
01:33:24,060 --> 01:33:25,660
And if he was wearing a suit?

1361
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:27,700
I have the technology to do that, sir!

1362
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:30,340
Come on!
- Take a look, sir!

1363
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:32,700
A white coat!

1364
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:35,020
Show me how he'd be like
if he had two girl cousins!

1365
01:33:36,300 --> 01:33:37,300
Here, sir!

1366
01:33:37,340 --> 01:33:40,260
They're watching us, but can't hear us!
- I can hear you clearly, P!

1367
01:33:40,300 --> 01:33:42,060
Now tell me where
this bike is heading!

1368
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:42,820
Just a minute

1369
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:45,060
It escaped from Poes Garden
and is in Gopalapuram

1370
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:47,140
Can you trace how much
fuel that bike has?

1371
01:33:47,180 --> 01:33:48,140
Yes!

1372
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:52,780
The fuel is running low on that bike
He can only go 5 more kilometers

1373
01:33:52,820 --> 01:33:55,260
Can we throw sand into his fuel tank?

1374
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,700
Definitely, sir!

1375
01:33:57,740 --> 01:33:59,340
Brilliant idea, sir
You are genius

1376
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:01,340
What technology!

1377
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:02,140
It's done

1378
01:34:02,180 --> 01:34:04,220
Carburetor's clogged
and the bike stopped!

1379
01:34:04,580 --> 01:34:05,620
Super

1380
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:07,420
Give me real time footage

1381
01:34:14,620 --> 01:34:15,860
Oh my God!

1382
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,700
Just for a bicycle,
he committed murder!

1383
01:34:17,740 --> 01:34:18,980
He is a dangerous fellow

1384
01:34:19,020 --> 01:34:20,820
Order a pink alert citywide!

1385
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:28,860
Okay, can we lower the air
from his tyres?

1386
01:34:28,900 --> 01:34:31,580
I'm sorry, sir
That's the one thing we cannot do

1387
01:34:32,580 --> 01:34:34,500
- Can you do it, sir?
- I can't

1388
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:36,020
- How about you?
- No

1389
01:34:40,820 --> 01:34:42,340
- We found P!
- Where is he?

1390
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:45,100
As his money is now invalid,
his people tried to desert him

1391
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:48,420
He had a bus take them
to Kovalam's Silver Bay resort!

1392
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:49,460
Who told you that?

1393
01:34:49,540 --> 01:34:52,700
One of the men who escaped that bus,
has now become our informant

1394
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:56,820
We now know where P is
What is your attack plan?

1395
01:34:58,060 --> 01:34:59,660
My plan is to attack!

1396
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:02,460
Call me after you finish him

1397
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:04,460
Shall I proceed
after the success party?

1398
01:35:05,460 --> 01:35:07,060
Let's try something different

1399
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,980
Let us finish our job first
and then have the success party!

1400
01:35:10,020 --> 01:35:11,580
It will be unique!
What say you?

1401
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,620
Alright
Nice change of pace!

1402
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,180
I'll lay down my
life for my leader P!

1403
01:35:32,260 --> 01:35:33,700
He's my God!

1404
01:35:33,740 --> 01:35:35,940
"Beautiful Kovalam!"

1405
01:35:37,420 --> 01:35:39,740
"Wonderful Kovalam!"

1406
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:46,140
We're brutally killing Shiva
Right now! Today!

1407
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:48,060
- Tell me where he is!
- Yes, sir!

1408
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:54,100
Don't give me so much crap
about tracking!

1409
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:55,660
Just tell me where he is!

1410
01:35:56,860 --> 01:35:59,260
He is at Kovalam, sir
Right where we are!

1411
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,300
Where in Kovalam?

1412
01:36:01,900 --> 01:36:04,260
Right here in this street,
in our resort!

1413
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:05,420
Where in our resort?

1414
01:36:06,980 --> 01:36:08,980
In our room in this resort!

1415
01:36:09,020 --> 01:36:10,300
Where in our room?

1416
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:14,860
He's under that table, sir!

1417
01:36:16,780 --> 01:36:18,860
Hey! He's under that table!
Capture him!

1418
01:36:26,860 --> 01:36:29,020
- We mustn't spare him!
- Only his phone is here

1419
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,260
I am right here!

1420
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:43,180
I was here,
but I had to go to the loo

1421
01:36:46,380 --> 01:36:47,580
Why remove your shirt?

1422
01:36:47,620 --> 01:36:49,700
Cause it is right for this situation

1423
01:36:53,100 --> 01:36:56,820
I've waited a long time
to meet you face-to-face!

1424
01:36:57,380 --> 01:36:59,820
I know you've been obsessed
with killing me

1425
01:36:59,900 --> 01:37:03,380
But, didn't expect so many armed
fighters would be with me, did you?

1426
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:19,980
What is it, man?

1427
01:37:20,020 --> 01:37:21,140
Got scared, eh?

1428
01:37:24,180 --> 01:37:27,580
Please spare me, P!
I didn't know I'd be outnumbered!

1429
01:37:27,660 --> 01:37:29,780
From now, I'll do anything you say!

1430
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:03,220
- Putting on an act and deceiving me, eh?
- Yes!

1431
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:06,420
As if I'm Kamal Haasan
and you're Aamir Khan, who loves my acting!

1432
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:09,420
You don't know how to act
I don't even know what acting is!

1433
01:38:09,820 --> 01:38:12,020
You told everyone
that I don't know to act, eh?

1434
01:38:12,060 --> 01:38:13,060
Shoot him down!

1435
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:30,820
Shoot his legs, man!

1436
01:38:30,860 --> 01:38:32,340
If I do that, it might hit him!

1437
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:33,740
Oh, that's right!

1438
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:42,780
What's wrong?
Out of bullets?

1439
01:39:01,140 --> 01:39:02,860
You call yourself fighters, huh?

1440
01:39:04,220 --> 01:39:05,220
Don't be afraid

1441
01:39:06,300 --> 01:39:07,900
No matter what,
I never hurt women

1442
01:39:08,620 --> 01:39:09,780
What a man!

1443
01:39:24,860 --> 01:39:26,580
You don't deserve to be left alive

1444
01:39:26,620 --> 01:39:28,140
You can't destroy me, Shiva!

1445
01:39:28,220 --> 01:39:30,500
Watch how I destroy you!

1446
01:40:19,620 --> 01:40:22,940
I swear I don't know who P is
Just came for a dip in the pool, sir!

1447
01:40:22,980 --> 01:40:25,380
Swear on you, sir!
Please believe me

1448
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:26,900
Who are you kidding?
Get in!

1449
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:03,420
- Thanks
- Within a single operation, you killed P!

1450
01:42:03,460 --> 01:42:04,740
Great job

1451
01:42:05,820 --> 01:42:07,820
What is this, sir?
Why give me 'halwa'?

1452
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:09,380
It's the only sweet we could find!

1453
01:42:10,860 --> 01:42:13,180
For what you did,
you deserve to have my job!

1454
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:14,820
Please don't say that, sir!

1455
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:18,100
It's true
But, if I do that, I'll be out of a job!

1456
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:20,700
As of tomorrow,
you are the Deputy Commissioner!

1457
01:42:20,780 --> 01:42:22,420
North Chennai is under your watch

1458
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:24,500
What about Vetrimaaran,
who's handling the area?

1459
01:42:24,580 --> 01:42:27,500
He'll be sent on 'Visaranai'(Interrogation)
North Chennai is yours!

1460
01:42:28,340 --> 01:42:30,980
You must be tired from all that fighting
Go home and rest

1461
01:42:31,020 --> 01:42:32,460
- We'll talk tomorrow
- Okay!

1462
01:42:34,780 --> 01:42:35,980
Praise be to India!

1463
01:42:44,180 --> 01:42:45,300
Have some chutney, sir!

1464
01:42:46,180 --> 01:42:48,500
Didn't I tell you
that he doesn't like chutney?

1465
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:49,580
Get the other one!

1466
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:51,500
Here you go!

1467
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,180
Look over there!
Your man!

1468
01:43:16,540 --> 01:43:17,700
I still haven't been paid!

1469
01:43:17,780 --> 01:43:19,300
He's coming to kill you!

1470
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:20,380
Get that tiffin box!

1471
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:28,940
You killed my leader P, right?

1472
01:43:28,980 --> 01:43:31,220
The curse of virgin guys like me
won't spare you!

1473
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:32,780
You're a virgin, huh?

1474
01:43:32,820 --> 01:43:34,420
No kidding, sir

1475
01:43:34,460 --> 01:43:36,740
Anytime we raid a lodge,
he's the one there!

1476
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:39,620
Throw him behind bars!

1477
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:41,220
Thinks he's Bruce Lee, eh?

1478
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:03,940
To save me from being
hacked to death...

1479
01:44:03,980 --> 01:44:06,380
...she threw such a large
tiffin box at my head!

1480
01:44:06,420 --> 01:44:08,940
It hurt like hell!
But I liked that pain

1481
01:44:08,980 --> 01:44:10,660
I felt like giving
my life for her

1482
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:13,100
At least, I wanted to bestow
a life within her womb

1483
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:15,100
To that end,
we went into a duet!

1484
01:44:21,780 --> 01:44:23,700
"O dear lass..."

1485
01:44:23,740 --> 01:44:29,900
"If there ever were
another damsel like you..."

1486
01:44:29,980 --> 01:44:32,620
"Across seven births..."
- Gayathri!

1487
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:35,620
Right now,this song
would kill the pacing

1488
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:37,900
Won't happen in our film

1489
01:44:37,940 --> 01:44:38,940
Okay, let's go!

1490
01:44:42,580 --> 01:44:45,100
Okay, you go ahead
I'll meet you later

1491
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:52,540
Want any pickles?

1492
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:57,260
Ew! What the hell
is this crap?

1493
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:01,540
There's an old lady in the house
and you're watching such filth?

1494
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:03,380
It's 'Titanic', Granny!

1495
01:45:04,620 --> 01:45:06,420
Who cares what tonic it is?

1496
01:45:06,460 --> 01:45:08,020
Change the channel!

1497
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:14,460
We're with the man who shocked
the country. Mr. P!

1498
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:15,500
Let's talk to him!

1499
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:20,180
Why did you become the General Secretary
for this party today, sir?

1500
01:45:20,260 --> 01:45:21,780
15 Million members wished for it

1501
01:45:21,820 --> 01:45:23,300
Respecting that, I took it up

1502
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:24,940
The cops said that you died!

1503
01:45:25,020 --> 01:45:26,900
Just a mild flu and dehydration

1504
01:45:26,940 --> 01:45:28,020
I'm not dead

1505
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:30,820
I had 'rava idli' every day
All, mere lies cooked by cops

1506
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:32,780
So you're into politics full- time?

1507
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,180
Only you can answer that!

1508
01:45:34,220 --> 01:45:37,300
If you're elected Chief Minister,
how would you bring progress?

1509
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:38,940
For a second, my head was spinning!

1510
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:41,300
- May I say 'Long Live You'?
- Who else will? Do it!

1511
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:42,700
Long live our boss!

1512
01:45:46,780 --> 01:45:48,380
- Tell me, sir!
- What is this, Shiva?

1513
01:45:48,460 --> 01:45:49,860
You told that me you killed P

1514
01:45:49,900 --> 01:45:50,980
And what is he doing?

1515
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:54,300
Says he'll be sworn in today!

1516
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:55,540
I watched it, too

1517
01:45:55,580 --> 01:45:56,780
I don't get it, either

1518
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,300
You lied to me about killing him!

1519
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:01,660
- I didn't lie, sir
- But you did!

1520
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:05,180
In this world,
there are only 7 melodies!

1521
01:46:05,220 --> 01:46:06,260
Please understand!

1522
01:46:06,340 --> 01:46:07,940
I didn't say this
A director did!

1523
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:09,020
Oh, right!

1524
01:46:09,740 --> 01:46:10,740
I believe you

1525
01:46:11,900 --> 01:46:13,100
Alright, Shiva

1526
01:46:13,140 --> 01:46:16,660
Get ready and go to P's
swearing- in ceremony

1527
01:46:16,700 --> 01:46:18,180
He's asked for you as an escort

1528
01:46:18,220 --> 01:46:19,940
Why must I be his escort?

1529
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:24,100
We must provide security!

1530
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:26,740
Please understand...

1531
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:29,980
This is my order!

1532
01:46:30,580 --> 01:46:32,180
And my order is law!

1533
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:33,940
I don't get anything you're saying

1534
01:46:34,820 --> 01:46:37,580
But, because you said so,
I'll do it

1535
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:40,700
Mr. P, who was said to be killed
by cops, is being sworn- in...

1536
01:46:41,940 --> 01:46:45,300
...in a grand ceremony,
that you're watching live!

1537
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:47,540
How did P rise from the dead?

1538
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:51,620
The public are in a state of confusion,
as they don't get the logic...

1539
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:53,980
...of how he was designated
this new post!

1540
01:46:54,060 --> 01:46:55,740
When asked about it, he said this:

1541
01:46:55,780 --> 01:47:01,060
Betrayal will never prosper
Old 1000 rupee notes are no longer proper!

1542
01:47:01,100 --> 01:47:04,580
We're waiting with bated breath
for his arrival!

1543
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:08,300
The Commissioner told me to meet you

1544
01:47:08,380 --> 01:47:11,340
Stay here until Mr P arrives
Chief Minister's orders

1545
01:47:11,380 --> 01:47:12,860
Long live our leader!

1546
01:47:12,980 --> 01:47:14,820
Long live our royal brother!

1547
01:47:14,900 --> 01:47:16,460
Long live our leader!

1548
01:47:16,540 --> 01:47:18,220
Long live, O light of tomorrow!

1549
01:47:18,300 --> 01:47:20,180
Long live, O history of tomorrow!

1550
01:47:20,260 --> 01:47:22,140
Long live, O future of tomorrow!

1551
01:47:22,260 --> 01:47:23,700
Long live our leader!

1552
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:29,980
Long live, O friend to the poor!

1553
01:47:30,020 --> 01:47:31,420
Good day, boss!
Welcome!

1554
01:47:51,100 --> 01:47:52,500
I'm like your grandfather

1555
01:48:08,100 --> 01:48:12,100
What's the deal, Inspector General?
Won't this cop salute me?

1556
01:48:12,180 --> 01:48:13,180
Salute him, Shiva

1557
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:28,740
- Boss...
- It's okay...

1558
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:32,020
Yo, cop!
Slip this onto my feet

1559
01:48:32,060 --> 01:48:34,100
Shiva!
Place his slipper onto his feet!

1560
01:48:34,660 --> 01:48:35,660
Do it!

1561
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:43,380
What are you doing, Shiva?

1562
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:45,380
Wiping the dung from it
onto me, sir!

1563
01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:46,500
Only then, will I get it!

1564
01:48:46,540 --> 01:48:48,060
Put it onto his feet!

1565
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:52,660
Hey, P!

1566
01:48:54,980 --> 01:48:57,100
Don't flaunt it because you're alive

1567
01:48:57,140 --> 01:48:59,740
Even if you become Chief Minister,
I'll destroy you!

1568
01:48:59,780 --> 01:49:01,620
No spots on the tiger, you will see!

1569
01:49:01,700 --> 01:49:03,300
No one can destroy me!

1570
01:49:04,060 --> 01:49:05,060
I will destroy you!

1571
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:06,780
Never mind destroying me!

1572
01:49:06,860 --> 01:49:09,100
Your new girlfriend's
being chased out there

1573
01:49:09,180 --> 01:49:10,580
Save her if you can!

1574
01:49:10,620 --> 01:49:12,060
Hey!
What are you saying?

1575
01:49:12,140 --> 01:49:15,180
My men are hunting down your girl!
Save her if you can, I said!

1576
01:49:15,220 --> 01:49:17,140
I'll deal with you later!

1577
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:21,380
Where is the women's wing?

1578
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:23,780
Just a minute, Shiva

1579
01:49:24,700 --> 01:49:25,700
Where are you going?

1580
01:49:25,740 --> 01:49:28,020
To save my girlfriend
Gayathri and kill P!

1581
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:31,820
No matter what,
you can neither save Gayathri, nor kill P

1582
01:49:31,860 --> 01:49:33,820
Why?
- Because he has the boon of immortality

1583
01:49:33,860 --> 01:49:36,180
Immortality, eh?
Are you out of your mind?

1584
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:39,100
- Listen to me, Shiva
- Get lost! I have to save Gayathri!

1585
01:49:39,140 --> 01:49:40,820
When I tell you this,
you'll come with me

1586
01:49:40,860 --> 01:49:41,620
What?

1587
01:49:41,660 --> 01:49:44,020
Last Monday, what book did you hide
in that case file...

1588
01:49:44,060 --> 01:49:45,660
...and read at the police station?

1589
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:54,260
Why take a bus, Bodhi?
You could've told me right there

1590
01:49:54,300 --> 01:49:57,860
No. Things like this must be told
only inside a cave

1591
01:49:57,900 --> 01:49:59,820
This is the cave we use for flashbacks

1592
01:49:59,860 --> 01:50:01,180
I see
Very nice

1593
01:50:01,940 --> 01:50:03,900
Your set up is excellent, Bodhi!

1594
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,460
Listen to me carefully

1595
01:50:05,540 --> 01:50:08,220
Contrary to what you believe,
P can't be destroyed easily

1596
01:50:08,300 --> 01:50:11,180
Because, the feud between you both
has lasted 76 generations!

1597
01:50:11,220 --> 01:50:12,900
What?
76 generations?

1598
01:50:12,980 --> 01:50:15,780
Let me elaborate
300 years before the birth of Christ...

1599
01:50:15,820 --> 01:50:18,900
...the place now known as Kovai,
was ruled by Emperor Adhiyaman!

1600
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:33,860
- Was I that Adhiyaman?
- Listen up

1601
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:36,420
Interrupt me like this,
I won't tell you the flashback!

1602
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:38,540
Sorry, Bodhi
Please continue

1603
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:41,020
P was a dance teacher
in Adhiyaman's royal court

1604
01:50:41,060 --> 01:50:43,420
People respectfully called him
'Peeyar (PR)'

1605
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:46,140
The dancing of P, was demonic!

1606
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:48,580
Every time he danced,
the people of the land...

1607
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:52,660
...became victims to hunger, famine,
murder, theft and several such sorrows

1608
01:50:52,740 --> 01:50:55,980
Unaware of it, the emperor designated him
as dance teacher

1609
01:50:57,180 --> 01:50:58,980
At the same time,
in the South...

1610
01:50:59,020 --> 01:51:01,100
...along the fertile shores
of river Kaveri...

1611
01:51:01,140 --> 01:51:03,980
...after creating the divine dance
of Bharatanatyam...

1612
01:51:04,020 --> 01:51:07,060
...was the holy dancer,
Sage Bharathamamuni

1613
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:09,260
- Do you know who he is?
- Never mind

1614
01:51:09,420 --> 01:51:12,220
I'll answer and you'll respond
saying no more flashback!

1615
01:51:12,260 --> 01:51:13,820
No need
You continue

1616
01:51:13,900 --> 01:51:15,620
Sage Bharathamuni is you, Shiva!

1617
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:19,980
Oh my God!

1618
01:52:20,060 --> 01:52:21,220
Goosebumps, Bodhi!

1619
01:52:21,260 --> 01:52:23,300
Bharatanatyam is within my genes!

1620
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:26,420
So that's how I easily learnt the art
within just one night!

1621
01:52:34,180 --> 01:52:36,500
Continue the story, Bodhi
What happened next?

1622
01:52:36,540 --> 01:52:41,100
Unaware that P danced the demon dance,
the emperor gifted him with gold and such

1623
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:44,340
Bharathamuni, the lord of dance,
vehemently condemned this

1624
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:45,740
Cease this foolish act!

1625
01:52:48,660 --> 01:52:50,300
Who are you, kind sage?

1626
01:52:50,340 --> 01:52:52,180
I am Sage Bharathamamuni

1627
01:52:52,260 --> 01:52:54,980
I'm trying to be respectful,
as you're a sage

1628
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:58,060
Why do you deem my act
of gifting my court's dance teacher...

1629
01:52:58,100 --> 01:52:59,820
...an act of foolishness?

1630
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:04,020
Naming he who performs the dance
of the demons as the royal dance teacher...

1631
01:53:04,060 --> 01:53:06,820
...and showering him with gold
and precious offerings...

1632
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:09,780
...cannot be called anything
but an act of foolishness, sire!

1633
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:10,860
What is this, sire?

1634
01:53:10,900 --> 01:53:13,860
Some random bearded stranger
is insulting the royal dance teacher!

1635
01:53:13,900 --> 01:53:16,700
You're nodding along with him,
rather than beheading him!

1636
01:53:16,740 --> 01:53:20,500
Do not get angry, PR
There seems to be some truth in his words

1637
01:53:20,580 --> 01:53:21,780
What does that imply?

1638
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:24,020
Do you accuse me
of doing the demon dance?

1639
01:53:24,060 --> 01:53:25,020
No, my boy

1640
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:27,860
If mine is the dance of the demons,
then, which is of the divine?

1641
01:53:27,940 --> 01:53:29,780
It is my Bharatanatyam!

1642
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:30,980
It is the most divine!

1643
01:53:31,020 --> 01:53:32,700
No! My dance is the divine dance!

1644
01:53:32,740 --> 01:53:34,140
My dance is the divine dance!

1645
01:53:34,180 --> 01:53:35,420
Yours is that of the demon!

1646
01:53:35,540 --> 01:53:36,500
Calm down

1647
01:53:37,220 --> 01:53:38,580
Cease this fighting!

1648
01:53:38,660 --> 01:53:42,900
Let us have a contest to deduce
which dance is divine and which is demonic

1649
01:53:43,020 --> 01:53:46,100
The winner will be awarded
the divine jackfruit...

1650
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:48,700
...that was given to me by Lady Avvaiyar!

1651
01:53:49,740 --> 01:53:52,460
Upon consuming it,
you can attain immortality!

1652
01:53:53,380 --> 01:53:54,500
Not only that!

1653
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:58,380
My daughter, Khalasi
The princess of this kingdom

1654
01:53:58,460 --> 01:54:01,220
The winner of this competition
can wed her

1655
01:54:02,860 --> 01:54:06,860
When the emperor announced the contest,
P intended to win it in deceitful ways

1656
01:54:06,940 --> 01:54:09,740
He sent mercenaries to kill
Sage Bharathamuni...

1657
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:11,460
...who was on his way to the contest

1658
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:15,660
Careful!
- Run!

1659
01:54:17,580 --> 01:54:18,980
Faster!

1660
01:54:26,180 --> 01:54:27,500
Granny!

1661
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:32,100
Even if I lose my life,
I shall not part ways with you, granny!

1662
01:54:32,180 --> 01:54:34,020
Even if they stab me in the back...

1663
01:54:34,060 --> 01:54:36,940
...I shall be back like the phoenix!
Keep running!

1664
01:54:38,540 --> 01:54:40,900
Where are you going?

1665
01:54:40,940 --> 01:54:42,660
Come along, Bharathamuni!

1666
01:54:42,700 --> 01:54:45,140
I won't!
I'm scared!

1667
01:54:45,380 --> 01:54:47,020
How stupid!
I'll come!

1668
01:54:47,900 --> 01:54:49,380
Gently, granny!

1669
01:55:04,860 --> 01:55:06,620
Come, let us check the other side!

1670
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:12,300
My clothes are getting wet
Hoist me higher!

1671
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:30,540
"A lifeless vessel, you became..."

1672
01:55:30,780 --> 01:55:34,740
"...and simply slipped away!"

1673
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:42,780
"Became one with everlasting water,
you did!"

1674
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:43,980
Granny!

1675
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:45,740
Your death will not be in vain!

1676
01:55:45,780 --> 01:55:48,140
I shall fulfill your wishes!

1677
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:49,460
Dear Granny!

1678
01:55:51,900 --> 01:55:55,940
"Be it by the hand of fate
or the wings of treachery..."

1679
01:55:57,380 --> 01:55:59,740
"...the river runs deep
Now and forever!"

1680
01:56:05,900 --> 01:56:09,940
"Will he drown?
Will he resurface?"

1681
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:14,820
"Like waves in an ocean..."

1682
01:56:18,020 --> 01:56:20,980
"...do not fade away"

1683
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:25,020
Unaware of this atrocity,
people got ready for the contest

1684
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:26,780
Greetings to you all!

1685
01:56:26,860 --> 01:56:30,380
What will transpire today,
is an event that will transform history!

1686
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:33,700
Let us see who will win this prize!

1687
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:35,180
May the competition begin!

1688
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:37,380
Sire! Sage Bharathamuni will not come!

1689
01:56:39,220 --> 01:56:41,820
Fearing the contest,
he ran away to the American nation!

1690
01:56:41,860 --> 01:56:44,380
Trusting them, we made a mistake
by spending 120 rupees!

1691
01:56:44,420 --> 01:56:45,500
Quiet down!

1692
01:56:49,340 --> 01:56:51,340
At this time,
the drum will be struck thrice

1693
01:56:53,580 --> 01:56:56,500
If Sage Bharathamuni arrives by then,
the contest will occur

1694
01:56:56,540 --> 01:57:00,140
If not, it shall be announced
that PR is the winner!

1695
01:57:06,460 --> 01:57:08,540
Justice always prevails against evil

1696
01:57:08,620 --> 01:57:12,180
But, on that day, evil prevailed
And justice hung its head in shame

1697
01:57:12,220 --> 01:57:14,740
The emperor gifted that jackfruit
to P

1698
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:17,540
P ate the fruit,
and attained immortality

1699
01:57:17,620 --> 01:57:20,340
That's how he returned,
even after you killed him

1700
01:57:21,460 --> 01:57:23,180
Does that mean I can never kill him?

1701
01:57:23,260 --> 01:57:25,060
You can do it
There is a way

1702
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:27,100
You must go 3300 years back in time...

1703
01:57:27,140 --> 01:57:29,820
...participate and defeat P
in that contest...

1704
01:57:29,860 --> 01:57:31,580
...and keep him
from eating that fruit!

1705
01:57:31,620 --> 01:57:34,140
Be practical, Bodhi!
How do I go back 3000 years in time?

1706
01:57:34,180 --> 01:57:36,300
Simple
Go to Burma Bazaar

1707
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:38,140
You'll find a watch mechanic like me

1708
01:57:38,220 --> 01:57:40,060
On asking him,
he will give you a watch

1709
01:57:40,140 --> 01:57:41,780
With it, you can time travel!

1710
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:43,300
- Time travel?
- Indeed!

1711
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:45,500
Okay

1712
01:57:46,300 --> 01:57:49,380
I have gotten a second chance
to destroy injustice!

1713
01:57:49,700 --> 01:57:51,500
Before you leave,
wear these

1714
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:53,580
Why?

1715
01:58:06,140 --> 01:58:09,020
Can't you just do it?
The stuff that I have to deal with!

1716
01:58:12,860 --> 01:58:14,300
Basically, I'm a watch mechanic!

1717
01:58:14,380 --> 01:58:16,300
See that clock?
It's accurate, thanks to me!

1718
01:58:16,340 --> 01:58:17,900
Cause I'm a watch mechanic!

1719
01:58:17,940 --> 01:58:20,260
Does this place say
you're a bike mechanic?

1720
01:58:20,300 --> 01:58:21,420
Why repeat yourself?

1721
01:58:21,460 --> 01:58:23,060
Cause I'm a watch mechanic!

1722
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:25,460
Say it again, your face is a goner!
Give me that watch

1723
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:28,460
- Which one?
- The one Bodhidharma said can time travel!

1724
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:30,540
- Why?
- To destroy injustice

1725
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:32,580
Then I'll definitely give it to you
Hold on

1726
01:58:37,220 --> 01:58:38,860
This is a time travel watch, eh?

1727
01:58:39,740 --> 01:58:40,860
It looks like a toy!

1728
01:58:40,900 --> 01:58:43,660
- I'm a watch mechanic! See that clock?
- O God, that's enough!

1729
01:58:43,780 --> 01:58:45,260
Wow!
It's like magic!

1730
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:49,020
Where am I?

1731
01:58:49,060 --> 01:58:51,060
'Kongunadu
B.C. 1482'

1732
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:27,060
Sage Bharathamuni!

1733
01:59:32,380 --> 01:59:34,420
Rise up, Sage Bharathamuni!

1734
01:59:35,900 --> 01:59:37,140
Who are you, my boy?

1735
01:59:37,180 --> 01:59:38,660
You look exactly like me!

1736
01:59:38,700 --> 01:59:40,300
I am your 76th descendant!

1737
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:41,660
Is that so?

1738
01:59:41,900 --> 01:59:43,260
Why did you come here?

1739
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:44,940
In order to destroy P...

1740
01:59:44,980 --> 01:59:46,940
...I came back 3300 years in time!

1741
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:49,940
Hey!
Came back 3300 years, didn't you?

1742
01:59:49,980 --> 01:59:53,180
Had you arrived 10 minutes earlier,
you could have saved me!

1743
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:57,340
I understand
Please forgive me

1744
01:59:57,380 --> 02:00:00,180
What the hell, man?
You say you're my 76th descendant

1745
02:00:00,260 --> 02:00:01,980
Such a senseless guy you seem to be!

1746
02:00:02,060 --> 02:00:04,660
No time to discuss that now, sir!

1747
02:00:04,780 --> 02:00:07,420
Alright then
My life seems to be fading away

1748
02:00:07,540 --> 02:00:09,460
I don't think I will survive

1749
02:00:09,540 --> 02:00:11,820
You must take part in that contest!

1750
02:00:11,900 --> 02:00:14,220
You must defeat P,
and destroy him!

1751
02:00:14,260 --> 02:00:15,620
Can you do it?

1752
02:00:15,820 --> 02:00:18,060
Promise me that you will do so...

1753
02:00:20,820 --> 02:00:22,780
Sage Bharathamuni!

1754
02:00:39,460 --> 02:00:40,620
What is it, Princess?

1755
02:00:40,660 --> 02:00:41,820
I do not know

1756
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:44,740
A strange vibration
A feeling I cannot comprehend

1757
02:00:46,260 --> 02:00:48,940
Winter is Coming!

1758
02:00:49,020 --> 02:00:50,620
You keep saying that!

1759
02:00:52,860 --> 02:00:56,100
Our emperor is conducting an auction
for his father's soul!

1760
02:00:56,180 --> 02:00:58,860
He's deceiving the entire town
by doing so!

1761
02:01:03,860 --> 02:01:06,100
At this time,
the drum will be struck thrice

1762
02:01:08,260 --> 02:01:11,140
If Sage Bharathamuni arrives by then,
the contest will occur

1763
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:14,580
If not, it shall be announced
that PR is the winner!

1764
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:20,140
Sage Bharathamuni is here!
- Why did he shave?

1765
02:01:20,180 --> 02:01:21,420
Stop!

1766
02:01:25,780 --> 02:01:27,460
How can a dead man be back to life?

1767
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:29,260
He has arrived as instructed

1768
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:34,300
I haven't run away to any country, sire!
I am right here!

1769
02:01:34,340 --> 02:01:35,980
Alright, Sage Bharathamuni

1770
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:37,340
Why the delay?

1771
02:01:37,420 --> 02:01:38,540
Where is your beard?

1772
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:40,820
There's no time to discuss that,
sire

1773
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:42,500
I am ready for the competition!

1774
02:01:42,580 --> 02:01:44,420
Alright
May the contest commence!

1775
02:03:00,500 --> 02:03:04,820
"My dance. My elegance
My grace"

1776
02:03:04,900 --> 02:03:09,660
"The world shall melt
at the sheer sight of it, every day!"

1777
02:03:09,700 --> 02:03:13,940
"My Bharatanatyam
is the zenith of art!"

1778
02:03:14,020 --> 02:03:18,620
"The three worlds shall be mesmerized
by its pleasure, every day!"

1779
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:21,180
"Who will win"

1780
02:03:21,220 --> 02:03:23,460
"Learn it soon, you will!"

1781
02:03:23,540 --> 02:03:25,700
"A dancer, I am!"

1782
02:03:25,780 --> 02:03:28,020
"A maestro, I am!"

1783
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:30,300
"The destroyer of evil, I am!"

1784
02:03:30,420 --> 02:03:32,660
"Why all this arrogance?"

1785
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:35,060
"Who shall taste defeat?"

1786
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:37,220
"Learn it soon, you shall!"

1787
02:03:37,340 --> 02:03:41,420
"My dance. My elegance
My grace"

1788
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:46,340
"The world shall melt
at the sheer sight of it, every day!"

1789
02:04:07,740 --> 02:04:12,260
"Danced this art even within the womb,
I did!"

1790
02:04:12,380 --> 02:04:16,860
"The lineage of Lady Urvasi,
runs in my veins!"

1791
02:04:16,980 --> 02:04:21,500
"Notice the rhythm in my eyes and feet,
dear boy!"

1792
02:04:21,540 --> 02:04:25,660
"Sheer wonder in my beauty and my actions,
is it not?"

1793
02:04:25,700 --> 02:04:30,220
"Get lost, you ignoramus!
You do not deserve this stage!"

1794
02:04:30,260 --> 02:04:34,860
"Why blabber like so?
I shall break your back with my dance!"

1795
02:04:34,980 --> 02:04:37,180
"Stand right before me!"

1796
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:39,460
"I have no fear
Spell it out!"

1797
02:04:39,620 --> 02:04:41,740
"A fire, he is!"

1798
02:04:41,820 --> 02:04:44,100
"Be extinguished, you will!"

1799
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:48,300
"Name and fame,
will come my way!"

1800
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:53,260
"My dancing skills
will win all the awards!"

1801
02:04:53,300 --> 02:04:57,620
"My body and soul,
exists for art"

1802
02:04:57,660 --> 02:05:01,980
"Even my shadow can defeat you!"

1803
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:07,140
"Alright then, go away!"

1804
02:05:07,180 --> 02:05:09,380
"I am the synonym of masculinity!"

1805
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:11,580
"Why all this arrogance?"

1806
02:06:06,380 --> 02:06:07,620
You tore him apart!

1807
02:06:07,660 --> 02:06:10,100
Eviscerated him to bits!

1808
02:06:11,500 --> 02:06:14,060
Sage Bharathamamuni,
you have shown it to me

1809
02:06:14,100 --> 02:06:16,260
- Shown it clearly!
- Shown what?

1810
02:06:16,580 --> 02:06:19,900
You have beautifully shown
what divine dancing truly is!

1811
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:21,060
Oh, that!

1812
02:06:21,140 --> 02:06:23,260
The jackfruit is yours!

1813
02:06:23,340 --> 02:06:24,460
Sire!

1814
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:26,540
- Guards!
- Yes, sire?

1815
02:06:26,580 --> 02:06:29,060
- Have PR tossed into prison!
- It will be done!

1816
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:30,500
O, sire!
What did I do wrong?

1817
02:06:30,540 --> 02:06:33,220
My steps and movements were good,
were they not?

1818
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:36,180
What he did is no dance!
How long will you deceive the people?

1819
02:06:36,220 --> 02:06:37,340
Our system is broken!

1820
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:40,140
Bring forth the jackfruit bestowed upon me
by Lady Avvaiyar!

1821
02:06:40,180 --> 02:06:41,260
Will do, sire!

1822
02:06:43,540 --> 02:06:46,260
Khalasi, the princess of the kingdom,
is also yours!

1823
02:06:49,180 --> 02:06:50,260
Nice hairstyle

1824
02:06:55,260 --> 02:06:58,300
You call that dancing?
Who are they trying to fool?

1825
02:07:03,700 --> 02:07:05,300
- Excellent, man
- Thanks, buddy

1826
02:07:17,580 --> 02:07:18,660
Hold this, buddy

1827
02:07:23,100 --> 02:07:25,100
We cannot be together
in this birth, Khalasi

1828
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:29,500
Per fate, in our 76th birth,
your name is Gayathri and mine is Shiva

1829
02:07:29,540 --> 02:07:30,860
Only there, can we be one

1830
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:34,020
Don't misunderstand. I need to go there
right away! P is there, too!

1831
02:07:34,060 --> 02:07:36,780
I must go and save your life!
There, we shall unite!

1832
02:07:36,820 --> 02:07:38,660
See you there
Don't worry!

1833
02:07:39,500 --> 02:07:42,100
Go. I'll be right behind you
- Thanks, Bodhi

1834
02:07:43,820 --> 02:07:44,980
Yes

1835
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:46,820
He seems to talk way too much!

1836
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:55,780
Tell me where you are, P!

1837
02:07:55,820 --> 02:07:57,740
I will hunt you down and kill you!

1838
02:07:57,820 --> 02:08:00,180
Shiva, your girl is in my custody!

1839
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:03,420
I make the threats!
Not you!

1840
02:08:03,460 --> 02:08:04,780
Really?

1841
02:08:04,820 --> 02:08:07,220
If you are man enough,
try laying a finger on her!

1842
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:09,140
Is this Vani Studio?

1843
02:08:09,460 --> 02:08:12,900
Please keep a photo frame ready
in the same size. Yes, the same size!

1844
02:08:12,980 --> 02:08:15,500
I will do that right in front of your eyes!
Come over!

1845
02:08:15,580 --> 02:08:17,020
Where are you?

1846
02:08:17,060 --> 02:08:19,260
Climax, right?
Where else but Binny Mills?

1847
02:08:19,300 --> 02:08:21,020
Which one?
Airport or Perambur?

1848
02:08:21,060 --> 02:08:23,060
Ask the production manager
and come!

1849
02:08:23,140 --> 02:08:25,100
Okay
I will be there!

1850
02:08:34,860 --> 02:08:36,860
Is there lipstick on my lips?

1851
02:09:11,420 --> 02:09:13,660
What's with the new look?

1852
02:09:13,780 --> 02:09:16,700
You tried different looks!
Did I question you?

1853
02:09:16,780 --> 02:09:18,340
Hey!
Okay, forget it!

1854
02:09:18,420 --> 02:09:21,900
This issue is between you and me
Leave her out of this!

1855
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:23,140
She is innocent!

1856
02:09:23,300 --> 02:09:25,940
I'm going to do you in first!

1857
02:09:25,980 --> 02:09:27,340
Then, I'll do her!

1858
02:09:29,060 --> 02:09:31,300
Not if I do you in first!

1859
02:09:31,380 --> 02:09:32,980
You can't kill me!

1860
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:37,180
I have attained immortality!

1861
02:09:41,220 --> 02:09:43,740
Don't laugh so much!
Your time is up!

1862
02:09:43,900 --> 02:09:45,420
You are no longer immortal!

1863
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:54,140
I'm sure you know what this is!

1864
02:10:01,940 --> 02:10:03,180
Get him!

1865
02:10:03,260 --> 02:10:04,660
He shouldn't eat the fruit!

1866
02:10:08,020 --> 02:10:12,340
"Come forth to quake the world!
Is there anyone to match up against you?"

1867
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:19,100
"Rise up and come forth!
To your enemy, you shall bring death!"

1868
02:10:25,860 --> 02:10:30,340
"Come forth to quake the world!
Is there anyone to match up against you?'

1869
02:10:32,900 --> 02:10:36,980
"Rise up and come forth!
To your enemy, you shall bring death!"

1870
02:10:39,100 --> 02:10:40,820
"Like a raging storm!"

1871
02:10:42,660 --> 02:10:44,500
"Crush your enemies!"

1872
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:48,700
"Destroy your obstacles, O warrior!"

1873
02:10:48,740 --> 02:10:50,540
"Rise up, O warrior!"

1874
02:10:50,580 --> 02:10:53,060
"Praise be to you, Shiva!"

1875
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:01,340
- Why did you shoot her?
- How can I listen to all this crap?

1876
02:11:01,380 --> 02:11:03,180
Okay!
You do have a point!

1877
02:11:08,620 --> 02:11:11,020
Bro! The fruit is in my hand!

1878
02:11:18,020 --> 02:11:19,380
Anticipating you'd do this...

1879
02:11:19,460 --> 02:11:23,020
...I ate the fruit gifted by Adhiyaman!

1880
02:11:29,420 --> 02:11:32,980
Shocked much?
I bought this on the way at the Fruit Shop!

1881
02:11:33,100 --> 02:11:34,420
Buy 1
Get 1

1882
02:11:35,620 --> 02:11:37,220
Stupid, Fruit Shop!

1883
02:12:02,860 --> 02:12:04,100
Just miss

1884
02:12:12,100 --> 02:12:13,740
I will not spare you!

1885
02:12:29,820 --> 02:12:31,140
You sinners!

1886
02:12:35,780 --> 02:12:38,820
In the end, you have made me act too!

1887
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:19,660
What have you done, sir?

1888
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:22,500
Give us the sickle and get away!

1889
02:13:23,940 --> 02:13:26,180
Where do I go?

1890
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:28,540
Get going, guys!

1891
02:13:28,660 --> 02:13:31,420
We will accept the blame, sir!
Give us the sickle and get away!

1892
02:13:31,460 --> 02:13:32,740
Listen to us, sir!

1893
02:13:33,780 --> 02:13:35,580
I have listened to you enough!

1894
02:13:35,620 --> 02:13:37,380
Enough now
Just get going, guys!

1895
02:13:38,380 --> 02:13:40,740
Go and educate your kids!

1896
02:13:41,020 --> 02:13:43,220
Anything but engineering!

1897
02:13:45,460 --> 02:13:48,540
Don't ever give up on agriculture!

1898
02:13:48,620 --> 02:13:52,420
Never abandon it!
That's what feeds us!

1899
02:13:52,460 --> 02:13:54,020
Listen carefully, guys

1900
02:13:54,100 --> 02:13:56,380
Don't waste your kids' time
by giving them iPads!

1901
02:13:56,420 --> 02:13:59,780
- Take them to Granny's during holidays!
- Thank God you are here, sir

1902
02:14:02,460 --> 02:14:04,140
For committing this crime...

1903
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:07,380
...you are under arrest, Shiva

1904
02:14:14,020 --> 02:14:16,460
"I am nobody!"

1905
02:14:16,660 --> 02:14:19,780
"I am nothing!"

1906
02:14:21,140 --> 02:14:23,540
"I belong nowhere!"

1907
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:26,780
"I have no profession!"

1908
02:14:27,020 --> 02:14:33,980
"You must be prosperous,
for the nation to thrive!"

1909
02:14:35,260 --> 02:14:40,700
"For the plight of the poor
in this nation to improve!"

1910
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:46,660
"Leave me alone!"

1911
02:14:48,660 --> 02:14:53,740
"Please leave me alone!"

1912
02:14:53,980 --> 02:14:56,940
"Pretty please!"

1913
02:15:07,660 --> 02:15:10,820
You are being released today, sir!

1914
02:15:21,460 --> 02:15:22,980
"A nut is what you are!"

1915
02:15:25,620 --> 02:15:29,340
"The father of a fiery panther
comes forth!"

1916
02:15:29,460 --> 02:15:33,300
"Back away and hide!
He is a true lion!"

1917
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:42,860
"The International Superstar!"

1918
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,740
"Try messing with Shiva!"

1919
02:15:44,860 --> 02:15:48,420
"Run away helter skelter,
as if there were no tomorrow!"

1920
02:16:04,020 --> 02:16:05,900
"A sharply dressed gangster, he is!"

1921
02:16:05,980 --> 02:16:07,820
"A grey bearded monster, he is!"

1922
02:16:07,900 --> 02:16:09,740
"A trickster in khaki, he is!"

1923
02:16:09,780 --> 02:16:11,540
"The granddaddy of annoyance, he is!"

1924
02:16:11,580 --> 02:16:13,620
"Unconquerable and unflinching, he is!"

1925
02:16:13,660 --> 02:16:15,860
"He does not wince
at the thought of death!"

1926
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:21,140
"Run or hide, he will not!"

1927
02:16:21,180 --> 02:16:23,220
"He can't do crap!"

1928
02:16:42,980 --> 02:16:44,180
Joy!

1929
02:16:53,460 --> 02:16:54,700
What is it, Granny?

1930
02:16:54,860 --> 02:16:57,140
A mom for my child
is that what you are worried about?

1931
02:16:57,180 --> 02:16:58,540
No, not really!

1932
02:16:58,820 --> 02:17:01,900
Worried about how many more
this wall will sacrifice!

1933
02:17:17,940 --> 02:17:22,620
Stones and thorns may fill his path!

1934
02:17:22,700 --> 02:17:24,820
But he will not stop walking!

1935
02:17:24,900 --> 02:17:26,380
Hey! Who is that?

1936
02:17:26,580 --> 02:17:28,900
Shiva!
Look behind you!

1937
02:17:29,180 --> 02:17:30,820
Someone is coming to stab you!

1938
02:17:37,380 --> 02:17:41,260
Great men are not buried
They are sowed!
