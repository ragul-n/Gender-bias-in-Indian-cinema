00:01:39,155 --> 00:01:40,342
Brother Gopal.

2
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:43,435
Our head Mr. Ravi has changed
the entire picture of our village.

3
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:46,162
Yes, brother.
He learnt engineering in the city...

4
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:49,072
...and used it for the
development of our village.

5
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:51,467
He has set up canal
and water pumps.

6
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:53,044
He provided electricity
in every household.

7
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:54,305
God bless him!

8
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:55,613
Yes, brother.

9
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,754
Because of Mr. Ravi's
efforts school and hospital...

10
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:02,975
...were established in the village.

11
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,912
Mr. Ravi loves villagers
like his own relatives.

12
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:11,313
Brother, he has never
made his mother realize...

13
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:13,055
...that she's not his real mother.

14
00:02:13,356 --> 00:02:15,646
- He respects her so much.
- Yes. Certainly.

15
00:02:17,318 --> 00:02:18,451
Bless you, child!

16
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:25,786
- Mother.
- Hmm.

17
00:02:25,869 --> 00:02:28,895
Are you taking these eatables
to Mr. Chaurangi Lal's house again?

18
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:32,177
Yes, son.
It's our duty to help him.

19
00:02:33,126 --> 00:02:37,040
Remember, before dying
your father had said...

20
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,447
...that Mr. Chaurangi Lal
is his friend.

21
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,958
Help him in all his tough times.

22
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:46,560
And then, he's going to
become our relative in the future.

23
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,008
I like his daughter,
Neha very much.

24
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,336
Mother, you're not helping
him by feeding him daily.

25
00:02:55,005 --> 00:02:56,863
But you're making him lazybones.

26
00:02:57,316 --> 00:03:01,896
Mr. Chaurangi Lal gambles
all the time and eats for free.

27
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:07,398
And his son Vikram. He only
knows bumming around and stealing.

28
00:03:11,238 --> 00:03:12,604
Hail Goddess!

29
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,516
Scoundrel! Thief! Sinner!

30
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:21,514
Are you stealing offering
made to god? Leave it.

31
00:03:21,597 --> 00:03:24,035
- I'll not leave it, mother.
- I told you to leave it.

32
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:26,804
- Leave my hand.
- Wait, Vikram.

33
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:29,807
Give me this safe. Listen to me.

34
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,910
I'm warning you for the
last time to let go of this safe.

35
00:03:32,101 --> 00:03:34,657
Or else I'll pull
your hand along with it.

36
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:37,798
Rogue!

37
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:42,341
Will you pull out your
mother's hands that raised you?

38
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:45,412
Pull out your hand that steals.

39
00:03:45,843 --> 00:03:47,484
Isn't hard-earned
money enough for you?

40
00:03:47,568 --> 00:03:50,725
No! I used to get
a very meagre salary.

41
00:03:51,182 --> 00:03:53,206
You got a job for me
in the sugarcane factory.

42
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:57,319
But there they asked
me to work as a porter.

43
00:03:57,607 --> 00:03:59,516
Now have I stooped
so low to work as a porter?

44
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:01,653
Really? So what will you do?

45
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,860
Will you become an officer
or manager of the company?

46
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,886
Have you completed your education?

47
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:10,470
Illiterate ignorant!
You don't have any skill.

48
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:15,230
I'm telling you for the last time
to return and work in the factory.

49
00:04:15,593 --> 00:04:18,698
Or I'll beat you black and blue.
Get lost.

50
00:04:20,434 --> 00:04:22,336
Ace! King! Queen!

51
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,360
With your blessings I can
make the whole world my slave.

00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:46,287
On no! Is this the way to iron?

56
00:04:47,284 --> 00:04:48,678
If I go out wearing such shirt...

57
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:51,217
...people will consider
this king to be a slave.

58
00:04:52,372 --> 00:04:53,981
Where is my stupid wife?

59
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:55,610
Janki!

60
00:04:55,799 --> 00:04:56,978
Hey, Janki!

61
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,955
What's it? Why are you shouting?

62
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,498
You've spoiled my mood
early in the morning.

63
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:03,840
Do you've any sense or shame?

64
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:07,322
I'm your husband.
And a husband is like a king.

65
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:10,596
You've always dominated
me as a husband.

66
00:05:10,882 --> 00:05:13,511
But did you ever earn
anything for this house?

67
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:14,803
Stop nonsense!

68
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,707
Why didn't you iron this shirt?

69
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:18,327
It's already ironed.

70
00:05:18,411 --> 00:05:19,945
Is it ironed?

71
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,341
I want stiff ironing.

72
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:25,532
- Really?
- Yes.

73
00:05:25,814 --> 00:05:28,859
For that you've to starch
clothes in rice water.

74
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:30,485
There is no rice in
the home for us to eat.

75
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,820
How can I starch your clothes?

76
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,319
There is no rice to eat?
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

77
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,868
Why didn't that old hag Shanti,
bring the eatables for us?

78
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:39,159
I've brought it.

79
00:05:40,191 --> 00:05:42,205
Shameless!
Lazy brat! I've brought it.

80
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:45,041
Greetings, sister-in-law!
God bless you!

81
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:50,964
May god always keep
us under your shelter!

82
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:53,153
So that you can eat
for free till you die.

[LAUGHING]

84
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,084
Why are you laughing
like a shameless man?

85
00:05:56,209 --> 00:06:00,218
Your daughter has grown up now.
You're not bothered about her.

86
00:06:00,682 --> 00:06:02,712
You're always engrossed
in dressing up yourself.

87
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,951
Child, I've brought some
vegetables for you. Keep them.

88
00:06:06,563 --> 00:06:08,231
Why are you standing here?
Keep it inside.

89
00:06:08,356 --> 00:06:09,489
- Go.
- Yes.

90
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:14,170
- Keep some money.
- Yes.

00:06:14,446 --> 00:06:15,618
No, sister-in-law.

92
00:06:15,947 --> 00:06:18,503
You've been paying the expense
of this house for many years.

93
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:20,891
You've shouldered
all the responsibilities.

94
00:06:21,244 --> 00:06:24,498
How long will you and your
son take care of our livelihood?

95
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:27,250
Why are you talking like a loser?

96
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,726
They will do it till they're alive.

00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:35,308
Yes. They will provide us
and you'll eat without any shame.

- Do I eat from your father's money?
- Enough!

00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:38,804
Don't be so arrogant!

00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:41,465
- You don't eat from her father's
money but from mine, right? - Yes.

00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:44,559
- you can talk arrogantly. - Yes.

Go and find a job.

104
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,444
Why do I've to
look for a job daily?

105
00:06:49,189 --> 00:06:50,982
Do people work daily?

106
00:06:51,066 --> 00:06:53,727
You should rest in
between and play cards too.

107
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:56,035
- Will you play cards with me?
- Get out!

108
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,535
Go and beg.

109
00:06:58,281 --> 00:07:00,912
Mother!

110
00:07:06,873 --> 00:07:10,305
What's it?
Are you competing with me?

111
00:07:10,669 --> 00:07:12,190
You're simply mooing.

112
00:07:12,754 --> 00:07:14,822
You're eating your food,
but thwarting me from getting food.

113
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,794
Sit quietly.
Mother!

114
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,080
Why do you always come
here to beg in the morning?

115
00:07:22,514 --> 00:07:24,190
Can't you go somewhere else to beg?

116
00:07:24,391 --> 00:07:25,559
Useless. Fatso.

117
00:07:25,642 --> 00:07:26,863
Fatso!

118
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:28,767
What's this, mother?

119
00:07:29,187 --> 00:07:32,360
Your cursing is fresh
but rice is stale.

120
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:35,315
Even rats don't eat such
rice and you're giving it to me.

121
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,968
Get lost.
You're not a king, but a beggar.

122
00:07:38,265 --> 00:07:39,406
So what?

123
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:42,335
Both kings and beggars are
important for rule this world.

124
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,085
If the king collects tax,
the beggar takes alms.

125
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:49,376
The king rules in his palace and
beggar pleads in your courtyard.

126
00:07:49,749 --> 00:07:52,783
The king gives justice
and the beggar gulps stale food.

127
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:55,172
If I come to your door to beg...

128
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:57,799
...you don't do any favour on me,
but it's vice-versa. Get it?

129
00:07:57,924 --> 00:08:01,178
- So don't come to my house again.
- I won't.

130
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:03,407
Are you bullying me
because you're a cop's wife?

131
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,081
The wife of an uniformed
beggar.

132
00:08:05,165 --> 00:08:06,391
- What?
- Then what?

133
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:09,042
Do you think only you
give me alms in this village?

134
00:08:09,352 --> 00:08:13,423
There are many people waiting
in queue like beggars to give alms.

135
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,953
And they call out, 'Bhiku beggar!
Sir, come and take alms.'

136
00:08:18,195 --> 00:08:20,769
Get it?
Go. God bless you!

00:08:21,072 --> 00:08:22,699
There is no scope for her.

Come here.

142
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,838
- I'm here, sir.
- Sit down.

143
00:08:35,132 --> 00:08:36,594
Thank you.

144
00:08:37,589 --> 00:08:40,477
Why did you get shocked?
Are you jealous of my beauty?

145
00:08:40,725 --> 00:08:41,968
- You scum!
- What?

146
00:08:42,093 --> 00:08:43,786
You're sitting next to me!

00:08:44,012 --> 00:08:45,957
Do you know the of difference
between our status?

148
00:08:46,181 --> 00:08:47,338
- Yes, I know.
- So?

149
00:08:47,588 --> 00:08:49,754
I've to go to various
houses to beg for alms.

150
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,978
But you get alms by
sitting at home. - What?

151
00:08:52,062 --> 00:08:53,188
- No. I don't say that.
- So?

152
00:08:53,313 --> 00:08:54,898
Everybody says that.

153
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:56,734
These days even the kids are taught
the same thing in the school.

154
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:58,003
- I'll kick you.
- No.

155
00:08:58,087 --> 00:09:00,403
My clothes will get spoiled.
I've worn it last month.

156
00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:04,023
Sit down like a beggar.
You buffalo!

157
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:06,122
- Someone has said it right.
- What?

158
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:07,895
That life is like a beam balance.

159
00:09:08,328 --> 00:09:11,540
Those who are full of virtuous go
down and those who are lowly go up.

160
00:09:11,623 --> 00:09:13,331
Stop your nonsense!
Show your money.

161
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:14,793
How much did you earn?

162
00:09:14,876 --> 00:09:16,412
I earn more than you.

163
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,505
One day I'll hit you so much that...

164
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:21,323
...you'll forget how
to call 'mother and father.'

165
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:23,635
What will I forget?

166
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:25,720
'Mother! Father!'

167
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:28,678
- You'll forget it. - The food
isn't prepared yet. Come later.

168
00:09:28,932 --> 00:09:30,796
No, mother! I'm not begging.

Sir, your voice is very nice.

171
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:37,732
C'mon, let's beg together
from tomorrow. - Shut up!

172
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:39,359
Don't beg. What do I've to do?

173
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:40,747
Stupid jenny!

174
00:09:41,736 --> 00:09:43,127
- Master.
- What's it?

175
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,726
Look there.

176
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,560
Get side!

177
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:01,212
She looks like a
heroine of some film.

178
00:10:01,738 --> 00:10:03,743
Is there film shooting
in our village?

179
00:10:03,846 --> 00:10:05,036
I don't know.

180
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,332
- Since childhood
I had a desire. - What?

181
00:10:09,582 --> 00:10:11,349
- To become a hero of a film.
- You?

182
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,586
Master, how will our pair look?

183
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:15,440
She and you!

184
00:10:16,146 --> 00:10:18,093
Like a pair of swan and crow.

185
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:20,552
- I'm not talking about you,
but myself. - Shut up!

186
00:10:22,486 --> 00:10:25,510
- Father!
- She's calling you.

187
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:28,080
Don't grin.
She's calling you, not me.

188
00:10:28,658 --> 00:10:30,266
Father! Who are you?

189
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:32,952
I'm your only loving
daughter, Neha.

190
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:35,457
What's it, father?

191
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,123
Neha! You!

192
00:10:38,043 --> 00:10:40,704
You've changed so much in the city.

193
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,553
- Where is mother?
- Inside. Go.

194
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,632
She's in the kitchen.

195
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,947
I weaved many dreams in a flash.

196
00:10:53,368 --> 00:10:55,415
Everything has been ruined.

197
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,185
Monkey.

198
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:01,019
How do I look in this getup?

199
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,625
- I can't see you?
- Why?

200
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:04,486
It seems darkness
has put on the goggles.

201
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:05,764
Get lost!

202
00:11:06,281 --> 00:11:07,442
Mother!

203
00:11:10,478 --> 00:11:12,536
Daughter! You're here!

204
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:15,663
Daughter!

205
00:11:21,336 --> 00:11:22,681
What are you looking at?

206
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:24,939
Nothing.

207
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:27,389
How are you, daughter?

208
00:11:27,514 --> 00:11:28,757
I'll tell that later.

209
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:32,599
First tell me why no one
came to pick me up at the station?

210
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:35,749
Who would've come?
I can't go alone.

211
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:37,394
I had told your father.

212
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,530
But he has not time for this house.

213
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:42,244
Yes. You've started criticizing me.

214
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,168
You keep maligning
me in the village.

215
00:11:45,293 --> 00:11:46,425
Our daughter has come today and...

216
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:47,737
...you've started complaining
in front of her.

217
00:11:47,821 --> 00:11:49,281
- Mother isn't complaining.
- So?

218
00:11:49,364 --> 00:11:51,950
I'm complaining to you
for not coming to receive me.

219
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:54,462
You're a king's daughter.

220
00:11:54,943 --> 00:11:57,717
What is the need to come
to the station to pick you up?

221
00:11:58,123 --> 00:12:01,041
On the contrary you
should've brought...

222
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,336
...the railway train
till your house.

223
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:18,251
O my god!

224
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,355
You? When did you come?

225
00:12:22,439 --> 00:12:24,745
When you saw me!

226
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,319
The same old silly tactics.

227
00:12:27,402 --> 00:12:30,038
You've not learned to
answer any question properly.

228
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:33,824
If you talk clearly with wise men,
there is no fun in it.

229
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:37,235
Ok. You've won and I've lost.

230
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:39,003
How are you?

231
00:12:40,582 --> 00:12:42,319
I was fine little while ago.

232
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:46,129
But as soon as I saw you,
a storm has raised in my heart.

233
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,007
To ask you a question is like...

234
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:52,029
...putting your hand in
the honeycomb of the honeybees.

235
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:55,515
- Now get aside.
- Please wait. What's the rush?

236
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:57,803
Do you like the henna on my hands?

237
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:00,185
Very nice.
Get aside now.

238
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,479
Please wait! Look here.

239
00:13:02,604 --> 00:13:04,496
It has slipped down. Please fix it.

240
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:10,546
As you're growing older...

241
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:15,070
...your clothes are growing smaller.

242
00:13:16,543 --> 00:13:17,681
Move.

243
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:19,036
Help!

244
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,669

Help!

255
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,640
Give us the money
or else I'll kill you.

256
00:14:25,724 --> 00:14:27,908
I don't care.
You can even kill me...

257
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:30,275
...but I'll not give you the money.
- I'll stab you.

258
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:32,068
If you'll stab me, I'll scream.

259
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:33,612
If you keep screaming,
I'll keep on stabbing.

260
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:35,595
If you'll keep on stabbing,
I'll bite you.

261
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,520
They both are getting whacked
nicely. You too go and get hit.

262
00:15:31,128 --> 00:15:33,431
Please forgive me.

263
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,717
Why were they hitting you?
Any enmity?

264
00:15:37,801 --> 00:15:40,762
No. Actually I went to
the market in the morning.

265
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:44,057
I completed my task.
I hid my money under my clothes.

266
00:15:44,141 --> 00:15:45,392
And I was on my way.

267
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:48,562
When I reached the temple,
someone hit me from behind.

268
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:51,064
And he pointed a
sharp knife and said...

269
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:54,070
Give me all your money
or else I'll stab you.

270
00:15:54,734 --> 00:15:57,816
Then I realized that
they were thieves...

271
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,294
...and they wanted
to steal my money.

272
00:16:00,907 --> 00:16:02,520
How much money do you have?

273
00:16:03,493 --> 00:16:04,888
9 rupees and 75 paisa.

274
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:07,747
What?
9 rupees and 75 paisa?

275
00:16:07,831 --> 00:16:09,086
Yes. Why?

276
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,168
You're a very strange.

277
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:15,046
For such a small amount
you endangered your life.

278
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:18,425
Is this money more
precious than your life?

279
00:16:18,758 --> 00:16:22,888
Money! Because the
soul in this body is mine...

280
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:25,690
...but the money belongs
to someone else.

281
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:28,750
Yes, sir.

282
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:32,864
My neighbour Kishen gave me
his chicken to sell in the market.

283
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:34,733
If they had stolen my money...

284
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:36,985
...I would've lost my
respect in front of Kishen.

285
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:40,661
Shankar can give up his
life but not his respect.

286
00:16:41,072 --> 00:16:42,365
Where are you from?

287
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:44,451
Dhampur. You?

00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:45,828
Gangapur.

289
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:47,189
- Gangapur?
- Yes.

290
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,997
I've heard village head of Gangapur,
Mr. Ravi is very nice man.

291
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:52,605
Do you know him?

292
00:16:53,035 --> 00:16:54,339
That's me.

293
00:16:54,669 --> 00:16:55,812
What?

294
00:16:56,087 --> 00:16:57,297
- Really?
- Yes.

295
00:16:57,798 --> 00:16:59,020
O my god!

296
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:03,637
I always heard that sooner or later
god fulfils everyone's desires.

297
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,265
Today I've witnessed that.

298
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:08,733
I was very keen to see you.
Today I've met you.

299
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,653
C'mon. I'll drop you on the bike.

300
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:16,043
Stop near that banana tree.

301
00:17:17,357 --> 00:17:19,361
- Please come to my home.
- Not today. I'm late.

302
00:17:19,444 --> 00:17:21,112
- I'll come later.
- Do come.

303
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:23,153
- Sure.
- Promise? - Promise.

304
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:24,815
- I'll leave now.
- Okay.

305
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:31,230
If you want to buy or sell good
animals in the market, call me.

306
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:35,480
By staying among humans
I can recognize animals very well.

00:17:37,838 --> 00:17:41,259
In that case get me a good
cow that gives sufficient milk.

Fine. Come after 2 days.

310
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:45,510
I'll find such a cow for you.

- Sir, bye!
- Bye!

My result has been declared.

I've passed in the first division.

God has answered all my prayers.

When you were not even born...

325
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:22,305
I had imparted all
my wisdom in your brain.

326
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:25,099
Maybe that's why your
wisdom has been vanished.

00:18:25,183 --> 00:18:27,352
You've started again.
Do your work properly.

Or I'll chop you off.
She always insults me.

Fine. Listen to
me first then fight.

Mother, I want to join
teacher's training course.

Why are you asking me?

- Ask Ravi.
- Ravi!

333
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:45,119
He has borne all the expenses
of your studies till now.

334
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:47,789
There is no need to ask Ravi.

My orders are obeyed at home.
Not his.

I've not taught you
so much to become a teacher.

00:20:26,841 --> 00:20:31,985
"Even this pleasant
evening is blushing."

350
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:35,355
"I tried hard to hide it."

351
00:20:35,438 --> 00:20:38,274
"But this love couldn't be hidden."

352
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:44,610
"Now I don't fear
the consequences, dear!"

353
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:49,669
"My heart has uttered
your name slyly and softly."

354
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:56,647
"Even this pleasant
evening is blushing."

355
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,554
"I tried hard to hide it."

356
00:20:59,637 --> 00:21:02,397
"But this love couldn't be hidden."

357
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:08,755
"Now I don't fear
the consequences, dear!"

358
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:14,745
"My heart has uttered
your name slyly and softly."

359
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:21,075
"Even this pleasant
evening is blushing."

360
00:21:57,824 --> 00:22:03,848
"O beautiful, I've come!"

361
00:22:04,113 --> 00:22:09,947
"O beautiful, I've come!"

362
00:22:10,886 --> 00:22:16,146
"Wherever you'll keep your feet,
I'll welcome you."

363
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:22,591
"I'll shower all the love on
you that is there in this world."

364
00:22:23,297 --> 00:22:28,508
"Wherever you'll keep your feet,
I'll welcome you."

365
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:35,094
"I'll shower all the love on
you that is there in this world."

366
00:22:35,178 --> 00:22:38,030
"You've come as love."

367
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:41,066
"You've come like
a solace for my heart."

368
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:47,485
"Then what do we got
to do with the world, dear?"

369
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:53,797
"My heart has uttered
your name slyly and softly."

370
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:59,974
"Even this pleasant
evening is blushing."

371
00:23:52,342 --> 00:23:58,288
"O sweetheart! O lover!"

372
00:23:58,546 --> 00:24:05,254
"O beloved! O darling!"

373
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:10,809
"I've weaved many
colourful dreams."

374
00:24:11,313 --> 00:24:16,532
"I desire to rest
on the bed of roses."

375
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:22,635
"I've weaved many
colourful dreams."

376
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:28,949
"I desire to rest
on the bed of roses."

377
00:24:29,211 --> 00:24:32,056
"What is this restlessness
in our heart?"

378
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,979
"We've gone crazy."

379
00:24:35,062 --> 00:24:41,320
"I've got the message
of your loyalty, dear!"

380
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:46,551
"My heart has uttered
your name slyly and softly."

381
00:24:47,606 --> 00:24:53,146
"Even this pleasant
evening is blushing."

382
00:24:53,761 --> 00:24:59,671
"My heart has uttered
your name slyly and softly."

383
00:24:59,754 --> 00:25:05,354
"Even this pleasant
evening is blushing."

384
00:25:05,437 --> 00:25:08,345
"I tried hard to hide it."

385
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:11,240
"But this love couldn't be hidden."

386
00:25:11,323 --> 00:25:17,803
"Now I don't fear
the consequences, dear!"

387
00:25:17,886 --> 00:25:22,704
"My heart has uttered
your name slyly and softly."

388
00:25:23,793 --> 00:25:29,820
"Even this pleasant
evening is blushing."

389
00:25:56,451 --> 00:25:57,927
I won't open the door.

390
00:25:58,094 --> 00:26:00,192
You went at dawn and
are returning at dusk.

391
00:26:00,471 --> 00:26:01,777
You don't care for me at all.

392
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:04,152
You've got that village
head of Gangapur now, right?

393
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:07,157
I don't care even if he's rich.

394
00:26:07,473 --> 00:26:11,843
- Does he have golden
horns on his head? - No.

395
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:14,147
Do diamonds grow in
his farm instead of crops?

396
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,859
Why do you care for him so much?

397
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:19,157
Listen. I'm not your father.

398
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,777
Whom do you want to meet?

399
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,642
I want to meet Mr. Shankar.
He had called me today.

400
00:26:29,848 --> 00:26:31,265
Fine. Come in.

401
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:33,303
Thank you.

402
00:26:35,774 --> 00:26:38,075
Sit. Father will come soon.

403
00:26:40,453 --> 00:26:42,506
Forgive me. I didn't recognise you.

404
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:47,787
I'm village head of Gangapur,
Mr. Ravi Kumar.

405
00:26:49,091 --> 00:26:50,643
- What?
- Yes.

406
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,360
I'll send somebody
to call father now.

407
00:26:58,447 --> 00:26:59,631
Gangva!

408
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:02,405
Come here.

409
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:04,901
- What's it, sister? - Go to
the place of that moustache uncle.

410
00:27:04,985 --> 00:27:06,704
My father will be there.
Tell him to come soon as...

411
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:09,528
...village head of Gangapur has come.
Ok? What will you tell him?

412
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,413
The Ganga from Dhampur has come.
Come soon.

413
00:27:11,497 --> 00:27:13,159
The village head of Gangapur!

414
00:27:16,084 --> 00:27:17,374
Take this.

415
00:27:19,991 --> 00:27:22,554
Forgive me. I've said
many wrong things about you.

416
00:27:22,637 --> 00:27:24,597
No. You said the right things.

417
00:27:25,152 --> 00:27:27,392
There was only one small mistake.

418
00:27:28,151 --> 00:27:31,281
Village-head, my foot!
Does he have a horn on his head?

419
00:27:32,092 --> 00:27:34,227
Look, is there a horn?

420
00:27:36,984 --> 00:27:39,372
Sir, you!

421
00:27:40,213 --> 00:27:41,681
Why are you sitting on the floor?
Sit on chair.

422
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:43,851
I'm ordinary man. I'm fine here.

423
00:27:43,934 --> 00:27:45,223
Mr. Shankar,
you're embarrassing me.

424
00:27:45,306 --> 00:27:46,874
Don't be embarrassed by the fact!

425
00:27:47,126 --> 00:27:49,100
When did you come?
- A while ago.

426
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:52,006
I swear, I'm very happy as
a great person like you has come...

427
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:55,007
...to the humble abode
of an ordinary man like me.

428
00:27:57,031 --> 00:27:59,847
I've finalised the deal
of that cow for 1,000 rupees.

429
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,349
You too check it.

430
00:28:01,603 --> 00:28:03,064
It's enough as you've seen it.

431
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:05,318
Take this.

432
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:07,699
And this.

433
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,997
- What is this?
- Commission.

434
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,528
- Get up.
- What?

435
00:28:14,612 --> 00:28:15,745
Get up.

436
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:20,376
Lord Kishen, tell him...

437
00:28:20,785 --> 00:28:23,287
...did you ever hurt your
devotee by talking like that?

438
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:25,760
Just tell him. He's my friend.

439
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:28,780
And he wants to give me commission.
I'll not talk to you.

440
00:28:33,007 --> 00:28:34,386
Ok. Please forgive me.

441
00:28:34,812 --> 00:28:36,353
I won't repeat such a mistake.

442
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,048
Look here. I've kept the
money back and apologize to you.

443
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:42,722
- I'll leave now.
-You can't.

444
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:44,183
You've come
to my house for the first time.

445
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:45,862
- No. I'll not eat.
- If you'll not eat...

446
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:47,941
...it will be the biggest
insult of our friendship. Enough!

447
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:51,488
- Father.
- What happened?

448
00:28:56,497 --> 00:28:57,688
What's it?

449
00:28:57,772 --> 00:28:59,924
Father, why did
you invite him to eat?

450
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:01,190
He's my friend after all.

451
00:29:01,315 --> 00:29:03,956
- But there is nothing
at home to eat. - Nothing?

452
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:07,790
- Only rice water is there.
- Rice water?

453
00:29:07,873 --> 00:29:09,166
But I've invited him to eat.

454
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,468
- But...
- Mr. Shankar.

455
00:29:10,768 --> 00:29:11,958
Yes, sir.

456
00:29:14,058 --> 00:29:16,859
I forgot to tell you
that I've kept a fast today.

457
00:29:17,185 --> 00:29:18,384
- Fast!
- Yes.

458
00:29:19,144 --> 00:29:21,095
Yes. I've kept the
fast for lord Shankar.

459
00:29:21,457 --> 00:29:23,389
I'll come some other time.
I'll eat food later.

460
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:25,391
Ok. But you can at least
have rice water, right?

461
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:26,623
- Bring it, daughter.
- No.

462
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:29,911
- We can drink it during fast.
Bring it, daughter. - No.

463
00:29:31,111 --> 00:29:33,543
- Take this, father. - Don't
give it to me. Give it to sir.

464
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:38,673
Sir.

465
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,693
Wow! I've enjoyed it.

466
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,844
I've never tasted
such sauce before.

467
00:29:47,195 --> 00:29:50,754
While eating it, a person can
even nibble his fingers by mistake.

468
00:29:51,694 --> 00:29:56,238
The mixture of coconut,
chilly and coriander is splendid.

469
00:29:56,614 --> 00:29:58,812
But I've used only
chillies and salt.

470
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,693
Oh!

471
00:30:00,776 --> 00:30:03,470
Then maybe this is
the magic of your fingers.

472
00:30:05,072 --> 00:30:06,557
She cooks delicious food.

473
00:30:06,956 --> 00:30:08,649
Sir, if you don't
mind can I say something?

474
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:09,922
Yes.

475
00:30:10,005 --> 00:30:13,302
If there is a good hard working
boy in your neighbourhood...

476
00:30:13,386 --> 00:30:14,542
...let me know.

477
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:18,152
If I get Chanda married, I'll
be free from my responsibilities.

478
00:30:18,347 --> 00:30:19,727
A good proposal had
come from Rampur for her.

479
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,450
But I don't know why she refused?

480
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,864
- Father, I won't go far leaving
you alone. - Did you hear?

481
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,172
- She'll not go to other
village leaving me. - Yes.

482
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,120
Others have many relatives.

483
00:30:28,557 --> 00:30:30,920
But who does my father has?
Only me.

484
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,105
If I go,
can you live even a single day?

485
00:30:34,742 --> 00:30:35,904
You...

486
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,235
She's right.

487
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:40,216
If she goes away,
who will take care of you?

488
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,063
Don't worry.

489
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,222
Now it's my responsibility
to get Chanda married.

490
00:30:45,904 --> 00:30:47,181
- Bye!
- Bye!

491
00:30:47,451 --> 00:30:48,818
Come.

492
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,615
Master,
your feet move while walking.

493
00:30:52,817 --> 00:30:54,103
Stay far.

494
00:30:54,428 --> 00:30:55,554
How far?

495
00:30:55,809 --> 00:30:57,034
You're stinking.

496
00:30:57,503 --> 00:30:59,358
- Greetings, sir!
- Greetings!

497
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:01,721
- Come here.
- Yes, sir.

498
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:03,177
Come closer.

499
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:08,519
Don't you know who I am?

500
00:31:08,751 --> 00:31:10,973
You're the would-be father-in-law
of village head?

501
00:31:11,056 --> 00:31:13,850
And you're roaming wearing
a turban in front of me.

502
00:31:13,934 --> 00:31:15,430
Aren't you ashamed?

503
00:31:16,358 --> 00:31:19,386
Take off your turban
and tie around your waist!

504
00:31:20,757 --> 00:31:21,924
Get lost!

505
00:31:22,238 --> 00:31:23,523
Greetings, sir.

506
00:31:24,668 --> 00:31:26,078
Rascal!

507
00:31:26,162 --> 00:31:27,680
- Have you become arrogant now?
- No, sir.

508
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:30,495
You're insulting such a big person.

509
00:31:31,384 --> 00:31:33,078
Stupid fellow!

510
00:31:33,938 --> 00:31:36,194
Don't you know that I'm
the would-be father-in-law...

511
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:38,898
- ...of the village head,
Mr. Ravi? - Yes.

512
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:40,968
How dare you remove the
turban from your head and...

513
00:31:41,173 --> 00:31:43,590
...tie it around your
waist in front of me?

514
00:31:43,673 --> 00:31:47,281
Because you hit Kalu
and told him to do so.

515
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:52,438
But till I don't slap,
order and abuse you...

516
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:54,398
...turban should be on your head.

517
00:31:54,658 --> 00:31:55,836
Tie your turban.

518
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,604
Tie it even at night
or I'll chop behead you. Go.

519
00:32:03,532 --> 00:32:05,649
- But the turban was...
- You animal!

520
00:32:06,276 --> 00:32:07,577
Yes, elder brother!

521
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:11,033
For whom are you
holding this umbrella?

522
00:32:11,666 --> 00:32:13,602
- For myself.
- Really? - Yes.

523
00:32:13,685 --> 00:32:16,960
- Did I give you umbrella as alms?
- No, sir.

524
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:20,306
The person gets things
in alms can't offer to others.

525
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,754
Started speaking rubbish again!

526
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:24,636
No. Don't hit me.

527
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,952
This is against your pride.

528
00:32:27,231 --> 00:32:28,641
Who are you? You're a king.

529
00:32:28,784 --> 00:32:30,559
You're a big man!
I'm your assistance.

530
00:32:30,767 --> 00:32:32,937
So stop fighting now.
It is my work to hit now.

531
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:36,162
Now even if you want to be hit,
I'll hit you.

532
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:38,150
Now watch my magic.

533
00:32:38,621 --> 00:32:40,163
Follow me.

534
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:43,626
- Greetings, sir.
- Halt!

535
00:32:45,353 --> 00:32:47,996
You fatso lowly man! You bastard!

536
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,023
What have you considered him to be?

537
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:56,722
Is he some idiot,
imbecile, hooligan, dog or ass?

538
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:58,098
You're abusing me!

539
00:32:58,182 --> 00:33:01,727
- I am not. - Then? - I'm
praising you. I'm reminding him...

540
00:33:01,852 --> 00:33:04,146
...that you are the would-be
father-in-law of the village head.

541
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,586
And he has tied his clothes
below his waist in front of you.

542
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:07,942
You bastard! Remove it.

543
00:33:08,025 --> 00:33:09,944
- No. Let it be.
- Wait, your highness.

544
00:33:14,087 --> 00:33:15,459
Oh no!

545
00:33:15,866 --> 00:33:18,379
May you be ruined!
Look, what all he's showing to me.

546
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,581
- Come close and show it.
- No!

547
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,082
And remember one thing.

548
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:27,330
- Oh no! - Visit him daily
in this state till you're alive.

549
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:28,754
In the morning. Afternoon.

550
00:33:28,838 --> 00:33:32,175
Evening.
Night. Salute him for one hour.

551
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:33,801
- Happy, sir.
- You bastard!

552
00:33:33,884 --> 00:33:36,396
Wait, rascal! You beggar!

553
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,945
Wait, rascal!

554
00:33:38,273 --> 00:33:39,451
C'mon, distribute it.

555
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:42,643
- This is our 5 rupees.
- Sir. - Yes.

556
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:44,513
- Your dumb prey is coming.
- Dumb?

557
00:33:44,762 --> 00:33:46,461
Yes. The same dumb Uma.

558
00:34:00,507 --> 00:34:01,785
Stupid!

559
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:20,352
[LAUGHING]

560
00:34:20,745 --> 00:34:22,455
You can't escape now.

561
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,096
Don't spare her!

562
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,957
My queen. Now you can't escape.

563
00:35:24,084 --> 00:35:26,467
Forget that. Did you
complete the task I gave you?

564
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,021
- Yes. - Mr. Gupta.
- Yes.

565
00:35:29,105 --> 00:35:32,021
- Have you spoken to engineer
Mr. Tiwari for the temple? - Yes.

566
00:35:32,274 --> 00:35:33,859
And the work of the lake?

567
00:35:33,943 --> 00:35:35,787
- It'll start tomorrow.
- Very good!

568
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,572
Village head. We've been ruined.

569
00:35:38,656 --> 00:35:42,149
We've been disgraced.
We're dishonoured.

570
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:45,992
- What happened? - My dumb daughter
has been raped, sir.

571
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:47,639
Who has done this sin?

572
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:50,509
Mr. Chaurangi Lal's son, Vikram.

573
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,886
Come, Mr. Ravi.

574
00:36:06,216 --> 00:36:07,903
Have a sip with us.

576
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:50,126
Father!

577
00:37:50,209 --> 00:37:52,292
Father, save me!

578
00:37:52,375 --> 00:37:54,932
Leave me!
- Why are you hitting my son?

579
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:56,633
Ravi! Leave him!
- Save me!

580
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:57,965
Mother! Save me!

581
00:37:58,048 --> 00:37:59,309
Ravi, leave him.

582
00:37:59,392 --> 00:38:00,648
- Mother!
- Vikram leave him!

583
00:38:00,731 --> 00:38:03,566
This isn't the matter of our house,
but of the entire village.

584
00:38:07,172 --> 00:38:08,237
Get lost!

585
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:11,244
I'm going today, Mr. Ravi.

586
00:38:11,353 --> 00:38:13,345
But the day I'll
return from the jail...

587
00:38:13,428 --> 00:38:14,838
I'll make your life miserable.

588
00:38:15,123 --> 00:38:17,792
Wow! After all, whose son is he?

589
00:38:17,876 --> 00:38:19,210
Take him away. C'mon.

590
00:38:19,544 --> 00:38:21,588
Ravi, what have you done?

591
00:38:21,828 --> 00:38:24,048
He is my only son,
apple of my eye!.

592
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:25,751
And you've sent him to the jail.

593
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:29,185
You've dumped the support
of my old age in the jail.

594
00:38:30,206 --> 00:38:32,563
You're worried about the
support of your old age, right?

595
00:38:33,137 --> 00:38:35,396
And can't you see the
pain of these old parents?

596
00:38:36,144 --> 00:38:38,146
Their daughter's
life has been ruined.

597
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:40,726
It's hard to get
a groom for a dumb girl.

598
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:42,648
And now she has been raped.

599
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:45,301
Who will marry her now?

600
00:38:45,905 --> 00:38:49,427
Sir, I'll marry Uma.

601
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:52,147
I'll regain her respect.

602
00:38:52,994 --> 00:38:54,573
- Rakesh.
- Yes, sir.

603
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:59,333
And I promise I'll never
taunt her throughout her life.

604
00:38:59,918 --> 00:39:03,707
Because it's not her fault.

605
00:39:10,553 --> 00:39:13,056
- Greetings, Mr. Ravi!
- Mr. Juman, how come you're here?

606
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:16,184
I had come to ask
you how much more money...

607
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:18,478
...do you want as advance
for the crop of sugarcane?

608
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,560
For the crop of sugarcane?

609
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:25,109
- But I never spoke to you about it.
- What are you saying, Mr. Ravi?

610
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:28,313
You finalized the deal
to sell the sugarcane crop to me.

611
00:39:28,685 --> 00:39:30,660
I even gave advance
of 10,000 rupees.

612
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:34,452
- 10,000 advance?
- Yes. - Whom had you given it?

613
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:36,987
To your would-be father-in-law,
Mr. Chaurangi Lal.

614
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:38,948
- To Mr. Chaurangi Lal.
- Yes.

615
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:43,879
He even sent this receipt
which has your signature.

616
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:50,802
Get aside. First talk about work.

617
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:54,597
I'm here for that only.
My beautiful queen!

618
00:39:54,847 --> 00:40:01,020
When you don't meet me I sleep
and dream about you whole night.

619
00:40:01,104 --> 00:40:02,272
Listen to me.

620
00:40:02,355 --> 00:40:04,857
Meet me daily near this well.

621
00:40:04,941 --> 00:40:08,295
We'll play cards and
other games together.

622
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,739
Get aside. You always come with
your dirty intentions.

623
00:40:12,031 --> 00:40:13,829
What has happened about my work?

624
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,113
Your work?

625
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:17,370
- My work?
- Yes.

626
00:40:17,787 --> 00:40:21,030
Didn't you promise to
give me 5 acres of land...

627
00:40:21,416 --> 00:40:24,701
...along with water pump?
Where is all that?

628
00:40:25,378 --> 00:40:28,481
Water pump. The pump is ready.

629
00:40:28,673 --> 00:40:30,412
I'm looking for the land.

630
00:40:30,496 --> 00:40:34,050
As soon as I get the land,
I'll fix the pump.

631
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:36,973
Why do you get angry?

632
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:41,390
I've brought velvet sari
and sweets for you from the city.

633
00:40:41,688 --> 00:40:43,855
Wear it fast in front of me.

634
00:40:43,938 --> 00:40:45,982
Then we'll eat sweets together.

635
00:40:46,065 --> 00:40:48,151
- I don't want this sari.
- Please, wear it.

636
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:49,944
- Village head!
- Oh god!

637
00:40:50,194 --> 00:40:52,363
He hasn't come. I've come.

638
00:40:52,447 --> 00:40:55,198
May you be ruined!
I almost lost my life!

639
00:40:55,366 --> 00:40:57,565
Not yet.
The process has just started.

640
00:40:57,816 --> 00:41:00,807
- Why are you here? - I've brought
the fuel for the devil's car.

641
00:41:01,623 --> 00:41:03,750
- Say clearly that you've brought
booze. - It is the same thing!

642
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:06,336
- Will you've some booze?
- I don't drink. I'm getting late.

643
00:41:06,419 --> 00:41:08,283
At least eat sweets.

644
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:10,882
- I'll leave now.
- At least wear the sari.

645
00:41:11,174 --> 00:41:12,758
Shall I wear it?

646
00:41:13,274 --> 00:41:14,510
Why did you come so early?

647
00:41:14,594 --> 00:41:17,096
- So early?
- Yes. - I've come after 3 hours.

648
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,868
An Indian movie gets over
in 3 hours along with interval.

649
00:41:20,225 --> 00:41:23,781
- Is your movie very long or
is there dirt in the reel? - You!

650
00:41:24,187 --> 00:41:26,101
Hold your leg.

651
00:41:26,314 --> 00:41:28,608
And if possible hold
your other leg too. - Why?

652
00:41:28,691 --> 00:41:30,109
Your destruction is coming.

653
00:41:30,193 --> 00:41:31,603
- From where?
- Look there.

654
00:41:33,832 --> 00:41:35,782
- O my god!
- I'll leave now.

655
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:38,826
- Where?
- To beg for your coffin.

656
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,896
You bloody beggar!

657
00:41:56,052 --> 00:41:58,012
- Greetings!
- What are you doing?

658
00:41:58,096 --> 00:42:01,140
I'm working in yours
farm since morning.

659
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:03,656
Forget food,
I didn't even drink tea.

660
00:42:05,424 --> 00:42:08,790
By the way, this farm doesn't
belong to me, but Mr. Shambhunath.

661
00:42:10,942 --> 00:42:12,393
Yes. And the second thing.

662
00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:18,533
Those who swindle illegal
money don't feel hunger for food.

663
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:21,098
Yes. You're absolutely right.

664
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:23,997
What do you mean?

665
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,543
Someone took 10,000 rupees from
Mr. Juman Sheikh...

666
00:42:28,457 --> 00:42:30,920
...by forging my signature
on fake receipt.

667
00:42:31,462 --> 00:42:33,423
10000? Fake receipt?

668
00:42:33,644 --> 00:42:34,969
Just show it to me.

669
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:41,347
This is definitely a fake receipt.

670
00:42:41,681 --> 00:42:43,850
But who has done this fraud?
Who is it?

671
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,785
Look, before I get angry
tell me who the culprit is.

672
00:42:48,853 --> 00:42:53,902
So that I can punish the person,
who has conned my son-in-law...

673
00:42:54,114 --> 00:42:57,614
...in front of the entire community
by hitting him with shoes.

674
00:42:57,955 --> 00:42:59,098
Am I right?

675
00:42:59,365 --> 00:43:00,583
Answer me.

676
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:04,780
- Take this shoe.
- Whom do I hit?

677
00:43:05,366 --> 00:43:08,678
Stand in front of
everyone and hit yourself.

678
00:43:09,311 --> 00:43:11,916
- What do you mean?
- Don't try to act over smart now.

679
00:43:13,213 --> 00:43:15,091
Confess your crime.

680
00:43:15,747 --> 00:43:17,715
Or else I'll hand
you over to the police.

681
00:43:18,134 --> 00:43:21,584
They'll torture you
to reveal the truth.

682
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:24,682
Police? What's the
need to call the police?

683
00:43:24,766 --> 00:43:27,448
This is between father-in-law
and a son-in-law.

684
00:43:27,531 --> 00:43:29,952
I made that fake receipt.

685
00:43:30,036 --> 00:43:32,732
And I took those 10,000 rupees.

686
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:35,215
- Where is that money?
- They've been spent.

687
00:43:36,694 --> 00:43:38,099
- They've been spent?
- Yes.

688
00:43:39,232 --> 00:43:44,410
Your son and you have maligned
me in front of all the villagers.

689
00:43:47,552 --> 00:43:49,943
Before dying my father
had made me promise...

690
00:43:50,567 --> 00:43:54,496
...to help you and
your during problems...

691
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,087
...because you were his friend.

692
00:43:58,535 --> 00:44:02,136
And I've been fulfilling
that promise for many years.

693
00:44:02,864 --> 00:44:04,097
But it is enough now.

694
00:44:05,074 --> 00:44:09,269
It is a sin to act humanely
with blood sucking parasites.

695
00:44:09,619 --> 00:44:11,813
And it is a virtue
to treat them like animals.

696
00:44:16,025 --> 00:44:17,167
Master...

697
00:44:17,428 --> 00:44:20,363
...what are you doing? Strange
sounds are coming from within you?

698
00:44:21,948 --> 00:44:26,369
My heart is burning
with fire of revenge.

699
00:44:26,995 --> 00:44:29,582
- Is there a fire within?
- Yes. - Really?

700
00:44:29,831 --> 00:44:33,251
That Ravi is very proud of himself.

701
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:40,049
But if I'll not shatter his pride,
I'll change my name.

702
00:44:40,842 --> 00:44:44,236
He hasn't recognized me properly.

703
00:44:44,319 --> 00:44:49,271
I'll completely shatter
that Ravi's pride, Bhiku.

704
00:44:51,696 --> 00:44:54,938
Yes. I'm waiting for that day...

705
00:44:55,618 --> 00:44:59,799
...when he'll get
married to my daughter.

706
00:45:01,136 --> 00:45:05,307
The day he marries Neha...

707
00:45:05,945 --> 00:45:10,705
I'll cling to his wealth
like a parasite and...

708
00:45:10,788 --> 00:45:14,125
...make him bankrupt.

709
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:30,433
-Father. - Yes. The village
head of Gangapur is coming.

710
00:45:31,102 --> 00:45:32,268
Village head?

711
00:45:32,769 --> 00:45:35,024
God! Has that cow fallen sick?

712
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,484
- Sir.
- Greetings, Mr. Shankar.

713
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:41,677
Sir, how come you're here?

714
00:45:42,153 --> 00:45:43,756
- Wait. Is everything fine?
- Yes.

715
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,156
Is that cow creating any problem?

716
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:47,869
No. I've not come
regarding the cow.

717
00:45:48,237 --> 00:45:49,371
So?

718
00:45:49,554 --> 00:45:53,171
You had told me to find
a suitable groom for your girl.

719
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:54,527
Yes.

720
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,136
I've found that boy.

721
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:00,440
Why are you standing outside?
Please come inside.

722
00:46:02,983 --> 00:46:04,226
Nobody is outside.

723
00:46:05,227 --> 00:46:06,554
He isn't outside.

724
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:08,390
So?

725
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:10,668
That boy...

726
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:14,435
...is in front of you.
- In front...

727
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,626
- You?
- Yes.

728
00:46:19,881 --> 00:46:22,210
What are you saying, sir?

729
00:46:23,638 --> 00:46:24,896
Yes, Mr. Shankar.

730
00:46:25,894 --> 00:46:27,571
If you don't have any problem...

731
00:46:29,252 --> 00:46:31,344
I want to marry your daughter.

732
00:46:40,217 --> 00:46:44,090
Sir, it's true that when
the sunrays fall on the moon...

733
00:46:44,173 --> 00:46:47,562
...it becomes bright and
gives light to the world.

734
00:46:49,070 --> 00:46:52,417
But you're giving undue
importance to my Chanda...

735
00:46:53,432 --> 00:46:54,611
No, sir.

736
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:58,271
There is no match
between Chanda and you.

737
00:46:58,605 --> 00:47:04,007
Mr. Shankar, I'm proposing
to get married to your daughter...

738
00:47:04,816 --> 00:47:06,637
...not by seeing your
position but by your decency.

739
00:47:09,436 --> 00:47:15,538
If you want some time to think
about it, think properly and decide.

740
00:47:17,206 --> 00:47:21,252
I've to think whether
this is a dream or a reality.

741
00:47:23,615 --> 00:47:26,641
That day you saved me from
death and gave me new life.

742
00:47:28,444 --> 00:47:31,596
And today you're talking
about marrying my daughter...

743
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:34,641
...and making her a daughter-in-law
of such a big family.

744
00:47:35,766 --> 00:47:38,102
You're ready to make us your equal.

745
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,030
You're not human but
an incarnation of god for us.

746
00:47:42,114 --> 00:47:43,347
No.

747
00:47:44,090 --> 00:47:48,277
Don't think of me as a god's
incarnation, but a devotee...

748
00:47:48,957 --> 00:47:50,850
...who wants to stay
under your shelter.

749
00:47:52,153 --> 00:47:53,411
Bless me.

750
00:47:55,813 --> 00:47:57,898
God bless you!

751
00:47:59,302 --> 00:48:00,823
You've given me your blessings.

752
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:05,062
But ask your daughter
for her consent.

753
00:48:08,133 --> 00:48:11,803
When a girl feels shy
and leaves like this...

754
00:48:12,686 --> 00:48:14,681
...consider that she
has consented, sir.

755
00:48:15,013 --> 00:48:18,768
Sir, I'm going mad with happiness...

756
00:48:20,771 --> 00:48:23,109
May my darling girl
live a happy life!

757
00:48:23,954 --> 00:48:26,074
She looks so cute!

758
00:48:26,414 --> 00:48:30,031
Only her marriage with
Ravi is going to be fixed today.

759
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:34,950
And she's feeling shy like
a bride on her first night.

760
00:48:36,048 --> 00:48:40,085
- She is so happy. - Sister-in-law,
her father is happier than her.

761
00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:42,905
My heart is getting
excited and popping up.

762
00:48:43,352 --> 00:48:44,711
- Take care of it.
- Really?

763
00:48:44,794 --> 00:48:48,912
If it falls on the ground,
it will break into many pieces.

764
00:48:50,158 --> 00:48:51,915
Congratulations, village head.

765
00:48:52,164 --> 00:48:53,303
Greetings, Mr. Ravi.

766
00:48:53,386 --> 00:48:55,013
- Congratulations.
- Son, you're home!

767
00:48:55,138 --> 00:48:57,491
Mother, what is all this?

768
00:48:58,042 --> 00:49:01,718
I'm getting you engaged
with Neha today.

769
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:03,938
- My engagement with Neha.
- Yes.

770
00:49:04,155 --> 00:49:06,026
- But mother...
- What?

771
00:49:09,343 --> 00:49:12,089
I'll tell you.
But first, tell them to leave.

772
00:49:12,757 --> 00:49:14,860
- You may leave.
- Wait!

773
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:16,843
Nobody will leave.

774
00:49:17,012 --> 00:49:20,141
Mother, I want to
talk to you in private.

775
00:49:20,224 --> 00:49:21,539
Please leave.

776
00:49:21,623 --> 00:49:23,642
- Shall we leave?
- Let's go.

777
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:29,184
Mother, I don't accept
this relationship?

778
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:33,051
What are you saying?

779
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:36,178
Why can't you accept it?
What is lacking in Neha?

780
00:49:39,658 --> 00:49:42,143
Mother, relationships depend
on girl's family background.

781
00:49:42,471 --> 00:49:46,187
And I don't like this family. So
I don't accept this relationship.

782
00:49:46,434 --> 00:49:48,681
Who are you to decide?

783
00:49:49,712 --> 00:49:52,111
You'll have to accept my decision.

784
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:59,006
When Neha was born, I had taken
her in my lap and promised Janki...

785
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,288
...that she's the daughter-in-law
of my house now.

786
00:50:02,667 --> 00:50:07,009
And you want to disown my desires.

787
00:50:07,541 --> 00:50:09,592
I'll never let you do that.

788
00:50:10,024 --> 00:50:13,667
You've to get engaged
with Neha right now.

789
00:50:13,751 --> 00:50:16,369
I'm helpless, mother.
This can't happen.

790
00:50:16,587 --> 00:50:17,732
Why?

791
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:20,265
Because I've already promised...

792
00:50:20,348 --> 00:50:22,582
...to marry Mr. Shankar's
daughter of Dhampur.

793
00:50:31,636 --> 00:50:35,563
Before promising him didn't
you remember the promises...

794
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,893
...you made to your
father on his deathbed?

795
00:50:40,017 --> 00:50:41,785
Mother, I remember
all those promises.

796
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:45,456
And to fulfill those promises,
I've always helped them...

797
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:47,417
...since my childhood.

798
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,882
But in spite of that, her father
and brother acted shamelessly.

799
00:50:52,798 --> 00:50:55,578
Even though poor,
if they had been a respectable...

800
00:50:56,221 --> 00:50:59,612
I would've agreed to
get married in that family.

801
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,790
But they've taken undue advantage
of my service and my sympathy.

802
00:51:05,149 --> 00:51:08,180
They've done such pathetic
deeds that, forget marriage...

803
00:51:08,599 --> 00:51:10,460
I don't even feel
like being their enemy.

804
00:51:10,645 --> 00:51:15,840
And so you've promised to get
married to that poor man's daughter.

805
00:51:15,923 --> 00:51:18,301
Mother, they maybe poor...

806
00:51:18,384 --> 00:51:21,243
...but they've the wealth
of respect and dignity.

807
00:51:21,327 --> 00:51:23,141
You only live with that wealth.

808
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:26,548
If that girl comes in this house,
I'll not stay here.

809
00:51:26,631 --> 00:51:28,306
Do you've so much hatred
for your daughter-in-law?

810
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,021
She's not my daughter-in-law.

811
00:51:31,483 --> 00:51:35,041
My daughter-in-law is Neha.
I've just one daughter-in-law.

812
00:51:36,186 --> 00:51:38,759
If I don't get the
daughter-in-law of my choice...

813
00:51:39,326 --> 00:51:41,061
I'll leave this house.

814
00:51:41,305 --> 00:51:42,805
Is this your final decision?

815
00:51:45,694 --> 00:51:47,724
My decision is the ultimate one.

816
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:53,207
But you too remember
that along with my desires...

817
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:55,114
...you've broken my heart.

818
00:51:56,043 --> 00:51:57,904
Even you'll never be happy.

819
00:51:58,469 --> 00:52:02,425
Remember my word.
You'll never be happy.

820
00:52:02,833 --> 00:52:04,043
Mother!

821
00:52:07,428 --> 00:52:13,678
[CHANTING]

822
00:52:13,913 --> 00:52:17,339
[CHANTING]

823
00:52:17,422 --> 00:52:22,541
[CHANTING]

824
00:52:22,949 --> 00:52:24,207
Bless you!

825
00:52:28,184 --> 00:52:29,397
Be happy!

826
00:52:30,168 --> 00:52:32,310
May god bless you both!

827
00:52:34,113 --> 00:52:36,526
According to the customs
and traditions of the society...

828
00:52:37,207 --> 00:52:39,237
...the bride's side
has to give dowry too.

829
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:43,995
But I can't give you
anything except my daughter.

830
00:52:44,595 --> 00:52:49,061
No father. You've given
me your virtuous daughter.

831
00:52:49,571 --> 00:52:51,113
I don't want anything else.

832
00:52:51,917 --> 00:52:56,983
On this happy occasion please
accept this small gift from me.

833
00:52:57,301 --> 00:52:58,721
No, son. Don't do this.

834
00:52:58,804 --> 00:53:00,508
Don't refuse, father.

835
00:53:01,586 --> 00:53:04,339
You'll hurt not your
son-in-law sad, but your son.

836
00:53:05,406 --> 00:53:09,576
Yes. Now I'm not your son-in-law,
but your son.

837
00:54:09,896 --> 00:54:12,714
"O beauty, just tell me this much."

838
00:54:12,797 --> 00:54:16,209
"Why do the bangles
cling all night?"

839
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:24,138
"O beauty, just tell me this much."

840
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:26,848
"Why do the bangles
cling all night?"

841
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:30,217
"Why won't the bangles
cling at night"

842
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:38,425
"Why won't the bangles
cling at night"

843
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:41,642
"when her beloved
will hold her hands?"

844
00:54:41,967 --> 00:54:47,620
"My naughty lover
troubles me all night."

845
00:54:47,704 --> 00:54:53,414
"He doesn't leave my
hands if he catches it."

846
00:54:53,497 --> 00:54:59,287
"If I'll sleep
by making an excuse,"

847
00:54:59,371 --> 00:55:05,048
"he gets hold of my
hand and wrings my wrist."

848
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:42,116
"O beauty, just tell me this much."

849
00:55:42,199 --> 00:55:45,497
"Why do the anklets
rattle all night?"

850
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:54,310
"Why won't it rattle,"

851
00:55:59,063 --> 00:56:01,997
"Why won't it rattle,"

852
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:05,473
"when the beloved will caress her?"

853
00:56:05,672 --> 00:56:11,258
"My parents have married
me to a selfish groom."

854
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:17,051
"He only insists on his wish,
but doesn't listen to me at all."

855
00:56:17,134 --> 00:56:22,830
"My beloved do whatever he wants."

856
00:56:22,914 --> 00:56:28,985
"He doesn't let
me sleep all night."

857
00:57:08,606 --> 00:57:11,524
"O beauty, just tell me this much."

858
00:57:11,607 --> 00:57:15,192
"Why does the ring
shines all night?"

859
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:24,689
"The ring shines
to tempt the lover."

860
00:57:28,396 --> 00:57:31,274
"The ring shines
to tempt the lover."

861
00:57:31,357 --> 00:57:34,898
"Now you understand
the rest yourself."

862
00:57:34,982 --> 00:57:40,756
"How do I tell you about love?"

863
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:46,298
"You're a spinster.
How do I explain it to you?"

864
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:52,171
"May you get married soon!"

865
00:57:52,254 --> 00:57:58,081
"We bless you from
the bottom of our heart."

866
00:58:29,533 --> 00:58:31,310
Where is it? I had kept it here.

867
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:34,376
- Master, have you seen it?
- What?

868
00:58:34,633 --> 00:58:36,852
Can't you see I'm eating?
Stand afar.

869
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,526
So I'm not going into your mouth?

870
00:58:39,826 --> 00:58:41,921
I'm looking for my plate.
Have you seen it?

871
00:58:42,005 --> 00:58:43,109
- Plate!
- Yes.

872
00:58:43,192 --> 00:58:46,609
I haven't seen your dirty
and stinking begging plate!

873
00:58:51,326 --> 00:58:52,833
Very good!

874
00:58:54,737 --> 00:58:56,320
I had heard about
robber getting robbed.

875
00:58:56,404 --> 00:58:59,029
But the first time
a beggar is getting robbed.

876
00:58:59,113 --> 00:59:01,787
- Stop your nonsense!
- I'm not. I'm talking sense.

877
00:59:02,025 --> 00:59:05,425
- First you hated even my shadow.
- I still do.

878
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,646
You never liked to be a beggar.

879
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:10,498
I still don't want
to be a beggar, beggar?

880
00:59:10,581 --> 00:59:12,849
Then why are you eating
in a beggar's plate?

881
00:59:18,516 --> 00:59:22,154
- Is this your plate?
- Yes.

882
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,123
Empty your stomach too.

883
00:59:26,427 --> 00:59:29,658
That will be done.
But why didn't you tell me earlier?

884
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:32,126
I've ate your dirty
food by mistake.

885
00:59:32,209 --> 00:59:35,790
Now what will happen if I'm
afflicted by your begging trait?

886
00:59:36,356 --> 00:59:37,659
Your ruin.

887
00:59:38,075 --> 00:59:39,847
- What?
- Look ahead.

888
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:42,930
C'mon. Enough.

889
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:44,846
Good!

890
01:00:01,901 --> 01:00:03,048
Beggar.

891
01:00:03,282 --> 01:00:04,522
Yes, my brother.

892
01:00:05,204 --> 01:00:06,868
Who is this old hag?

893
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:12,466
I think he's that girl's
father and Ravi's father-in-law.

894
01:00:14,262 --> 01:00:15,447
Ravi!

895
01:00:16,457 --> 01:00:17,828
Wait, son.

896
01:00:19,676 --> 01:00:21,013
Who is she, son?

897
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:22,759
Aunt Janki.

898
01:00:26,237 --> 01:00:27,473
Come, child.

899
01:00:36,392 --> 01:00:38,535
God bless you two!

900
01:00:40,745 --> 01:00:43,726
Now place your right
leg ahead and step in.

901
01:00:59,537 --> 01:01:00,784
Janki!

902
01:01:03,290 --> 01:01:05,782
You're my wife and
you're blessing my enemies.

903
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,407
Have you lost your
mind or become shameless?

904
01:01:08,914 --> 01:01:10,051
They both are fine.

905
01:01:10,363 --> 01:01:14,500
I'm not shameless so I've
blessed Ravi and his wife.

906
01:01:14,778 --> 01:01:18,073
- Blessings!
- We are indebted by his favours.

907
01:01:18,677 --> 01:01:23,773
He even gave the stiff
ironed shirt that you're wearing.

908
01:01:24,471 --> 01:01:25,789
Shame!

909
01:01:26,595 --> 01:01:29,752
- Nobody scolds even a beggar
from doorstep like this. - Rogue.

910
01:01:29,835 --> 01:01:32,890
If anybody had scolded
me like your wife did to you...

911
01:01:32,974 --> 01:01:35,326
I would've jumped in
a well and committed suicide.

912
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:38,287
- Shall I search for a well?
- Stupid!

913
01:01:38,539 --> 01:01:42,569
Why do you always
scratch my wounds?

914
01:01:42,652 --> 01:01:45,305
- Oh my god!
- I'll not spare you!

915
01:01:46,395 --> 01:01:48,899
- If you had to return, why did
you come here? - Madam...

916
01:01:48,982 --> 01:01:50,484
...shall I bring mangoes
from the garden? - Yes.

917
01:01:50,567 --> 01:01:51,822
Okay.

918
01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:53,544
Where is father?

919
01:01:53,911 --> 01:01:55,176
Do it correctly.

920
01:01:55,508 --> 01:02:00,039
Like this.
Do like this.

921
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:02,513
Father, this is a woman's work.
Leave it.

922
01:02:02,653 --> 01:02:04,062
I've left it. Ok.

923
01:02:04,377 --> 01:02:07,235
I'm keeping protein powder in it.
Take it daily with milk.

924
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:10,591
This is drink is for sick people.
I can't drink it.

925
01:02:10,674 --> 01:02:13,033
- No. You've to drink it.
- Okay!

926
01:02:13,116 --> 01:02:16,159
Now stop roaming around
the market in the hot sun...

927
01:02:16,242 --> 01:02:18,182
...to get cattle for others.

928
01:02:18,266 --> 01:02:21,026
- If you fall sick, who will
take care of you? - Fine.

929
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,800
- And twice a week.
- I'll come four times a week.

930
01:02:27,219 --> 01:02:29,061
Can I live without seeing you?

931
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:31,470
Answer me.

932
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:34,502
And Ravi isn't here yet.

933
01:02:35,237 --> 01:02:37,578
I've taken his name and he has
come. You'll have a very long life!

934
01:02:37,661 --> 01:02:39,562
- Father is going back
to the village. - Why?

935
01:02:39,809 --> 01:02:42,961
- I've to take care of the house
and work. - Enough, father!

936
01:02:43,045 --> 01:02:46,799
You've done lots of work.
Now it isn't your age to work.

937
01:02:48,006 --> 01:02:51,672
Now take rest. And forget
about returning to your village.

938
01:02:52,784 --> 01:02:53,944
But listen to me.

939
01:02:54,028 --> 01:03:00,060
If you've any love or any respect
for your son-in-law in your heart...

940
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:02,653
...you'll not think
of leaving this house.

941
01:03:03,999 --> 01:03:05,444
Now it's your wish.

942
01:03:05,846 --> 01:03:08,547
What has he said? Explain to him.

943
01:03:08,731 --> 01:03:10,703
What do I explain? He's right.

944
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:15,121
And now even I'll say that if
you respect him, you won't leave.

945
01:03:15,446 --> 01:03:16,919
Now it's your wish.

946
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:23,493
Now what can be my wish?
I'll do as you say.

947
01:03:33,774 --> 01:03:36,736
You don't do any work properly.
You useless!

948
01:03:37,097 --> 01:03:38,803
I'll kill you!

949
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:40,561
Yes. Kill me.

950
01:03:40,644 --> 01:03:44,534
Instead of living thirsty
and hungry, it's better to die.

951
01:03:44,618 --> 01:03:46,078
So that I'll get rid of you.

952
01:03:46,161 --> 01:03:48,626
Are you arguing with me?

953
01:03:48,914 --> 01:03:50,165
You bitch! You imbecile!

954
01:03:50,248 --> 01:03:53,033
Enough! You've started
fighting early in the morning.

955
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:58,726
- Mother, please be quiet.
- She's arguing with me.

956
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:03,814
I'll chop off your tongue
and fed it to that beggar.

957
01:04:08,189 --> 01:04:11,933
I've seen unfortunate people's
evil face early in the morning.

958
01:04:12,513 --> 01:04:14,898
My whole day is going
to be ruined now.

959
01:04:15,271 --> 01:04:17,729
What are you looking at?
Get lost!

960
01:04:19,571 --> 01:04:21,113
- Dhano.
- Yes, sister.

961
01:04:21,577 --> 01:04:23,787
Why was fighting
going on at their house?

962
01:04:24,048 --> 01:04:25,537
What to say?

963
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:28,871
That sister's husband
is very useless.

964
01:04:28,955 --> 01:04:30,831
He doesn't earn
even a single penny.

965
01:04:31,477 --> 01:04:36,511
Your mother-in-law used
to cater for their needs.

966
01:04:36,595 --> 01:04:38,839
But it has stopped
after your arrival.

967
01:04:39,172 --> 01:04:41,573
Actually,
their daughter Neha was supposed...

968
01:04:41,656 --> 01:04:43,710
...to get married to our Mr. Ravi.

969
01:04:43,794 --> 01:04:47,141
But Mr. Ravi refused
and married you.

970
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:50,655
Because of this reason Mr.
Ravi's mother left home in anger.

971
01:04:50,962 --> 01:04:53,772
And sister Janki stopped
coming to this house.

972
01:04:57,775 --> 01:04:58,988
Aunt!

973
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:00,870
Aunt!

974
01:05:01,096 --> 01:05:04,655
Daughter Chanda! Come inside.

975
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:06,707
- Keep it here.
- Ok.

976
01:05:07,399 --> 01:05:09,491
All this...

977
01:05:09,575 --> 01:05:11,428
Don't consider me
to be an outsider, aunt.

978
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:16,092
Consider me your
own daughter from today.

979
01:05:16,852 --> 01:05:18,031
Please keep this.

980
01:05:18,257 --> 01:05:19,436
No, child.

981
01:05:21,148 --> 01:05:25,942
Ravi used to pay for the expenses
of this house before your arrival.

982
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:29,897
But it was a different
thing at that time.

983
01:05:30,248 --> 01:05:32,280
The relationships were
different at that time.

984
01:05:32,787 --> 01:05:37,536
But now it's not right for
us to be a burden on you, child.

985
01:05:38,102 --> 01:05:41,501
Did all those relationship
break after my arrival?

986
01:05:43,326 --> 01:05:46,495
Today if your daughter
would've brought this for you...

987
01:05:47,769 --> 01:05:49,651
...would you have said
the same thing to her?

988
01:05:50,558 --> 01:05:51,748
Aunt...

989
01:05:52,877 --> 01:05:54,820
...my mother passed away on my born.

990
01:05:55,999 --> 01:05:59,660
I've neither seen her
face nor received her love.

991
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:08,693
I want to present a small gift
to you as I consider you my mother.

992
01:06:11,649 --> 01:06:15,220
Please accept it and do
a favour on your daughter, mother.

993
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:17,293
Do a favour.

994
01:06:35,467 --> 01:06:37,339
Neha! What have you done?

995
01:06:37,422 --> 01:06:38,603
You keep quiet, mother.

996
01:06:38,687 --> 01:06:41,446
Aren't you satisfied
after ruining my life that...

997
01:06:41,529 --> 01:06:43,793
...you've come to give
these alms and insult us.

998
01:06:43,876 --> 01:06:45,043
Neha!

999
01:06:45,127 --> 01:06:48,587
Get lost.
I'll get peace only when you die.

1000
01:06:49,897 --> 01:06:53,926
Your cheap father and
you have snatched my Ravi.

1001
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:59,082
Look, you can say anything to me,
but don't insult my father.

1002
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:02,459
Or else I'll not
be able to bear it.

1003
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:06,512
You'll not be able to bear it!
Get lost!

1004
01:07:06,596 --> 01:07:09,065
- Get lost. - Neha!
Have you gone mad?

1005
01:07:09,148 --> 01:07:11,289
- Come inside. - Get lost!
- Come inside.

1006
01:07:11,373 --> 01:07:14,046
- I said get lost!
- Come inside.

1007
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:15,918
Mother, leave me.

1008
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:20,934
[CRYING]

1009
01:07:23,926 --> 01:07:28,849
I apologise to you for
her childishness and mistake.

1010
01:07:29,614 --> 01:07:31,321
- Please forgive me.
- No!

1011
01:07:32,191 --> 01:07:34,718
A mother lifts her hand
only to give blessings...

1012
01:07:35,003 --> 01:07:36,648
...not to ask for forgiveness.

1013
01:07:37,245 --> 01:07:39,424
Don't insult my
mother's hands, mother.

1014
01:07:42,994 --> 01:07:44,172
Daughter!

1015
01:07:46,584 --> 01:07:48,405
- Chanda!
- What's it?

1016
01:07:49,245 --> 01:07:50,945
Did Neha raise her hand on you?

1017
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:54,054
No!
Who told you?

1018
01:07:54,297 --> 01:07:55,979
Sister, I told him that...

1019
01:07:56,109 --> 01:07:57,340
Dhano!

1020
01:08:00,695 --> 01:08:02,096
Don't lie to me, Chanda.

1021
01:08:02,485 --> 01:08:05,057
Swear upon me and say whether
she raised her hand on you or not?

1022
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,180
Look, this matter
is between the women.

1023
01:08:07,264 --> 01:08:09,005
Men shouldn't interfere in it.

1024
01:08:10,091 --> 01:08:12,330
I insist to know the truth.

1025
01:08:12,523 --> 01:08:14,019
Look, she's immature.

1026
01:08:14,205 --> 01:08:17,537
What's the big deal if
she raised her hand in anger?

1027
01:08:17,734 --> 01:08:20,699
How did she dare to
raise her hand on my wife?

1028
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:23,807
- I'll teach her a lesson now.
- Don't do that.

1029
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,948
- Get side, Chanda.
- Listen to me.

1030
01:08:26,379 --> 01:08:29,725
- If I had been in Neha's place,
I would've done the same. - Chanda!

1031
01:08:30,031 --> 01:08:33,612
Look, it is only 6 months
since we got married.

1032
01:08:34,348 --> 01:08:37,792
And I can't stay without
you for a second.

1033
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:40,877
She has grown up with
you since childhood.

1034
01:08:42,135 --> 01:08:45,138
She always dreamt to
make you her life partner.

1035
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:48,511
Her dreams were shattered suddenly.

1036
01:08:49,081 --> 01:08:50,722
All her desires were ruined.

1037
01:08:51,757 --> 01:08:55,181
In this condition,
even a stone will crack down.

1038
01:08:56,088 --> 01:08:59,000
She's just a human being.
A weak girl.

1039
01:08:59,634 --> 01:09:01,437
What would've gone
through her heart?

1040
01:09:02,776 --> 01:09:04,012
And the second thing is that...

1041
01:09:04,096 --> 01:09:06,144
...you used to cater
the needs of their house.

1042
01:09:06,644 --> 01:09:08,323
Today they don't have any support.

1043
01:09:10,376 --> 01:09:12,425
The villagers might
think that you severed...

1044
01:09:13,151 --> 01:09:15,244
...your relationship
with them because of me.

1045
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:19,684
And the truth is that
I'm responsible for their ruin.

1046
01:09:20,212 --> 01:09:22,087
Neha's heart has
broken because of me.

1047
01:09:22,374 --> 01:09:24,966
What are you saying, Chanda?

1048
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:27,009
Will you listen to me?

1049
01:09:27,326 --> 01:09:30,053
Now don't change the
relationship that you shared...

1050
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:31,787
...with them before our marriage.

1051
01:09:31,912 --> 01:09:33,098
And one more thing.

1052
01:09:33,181 --> 01:09:36,853
Bring your mother back
from wherever she is now.

1053
01:09:37,182 --> 01:09:38,372
Mother!

1054
01:09:38,952 --> 01:09:42,803
Chanda, you don't know my mother.
She'll make your life miserable.

1055
01:09:43,205 --> 01:09:47,258
She'll criticise you day
and night and make your life hell.

1056
01:09:47,822 --> 01:09:51,371
She'll only criticise me, right?
She'll not burn me up, right?

1057
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:55,689
If there will be truth
in my love and behaviour...

1058
01:09:56,720 --> 01:09:58,206
...one day with my service...

1059
01:09:58,368 --> 01:10:00,962
I'll make her helpless to
give me her love and blessings.

1060
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,904
This is the real
duty of an ideal wife.

1061
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,697
Wow!

1062
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:08,633
How did you start
talking so wisely?

1063
01:10:09,391 --> 01:10:13,866
I think that you're a
complete dumb and insensible.

1064
01:10:14,222 --> 01:10:16,998
You don't have any knowledge
about house and family.

1065
01:10:17,299 --> 01:10:18,478
Really?

1066
01:10:18,856 --> 01:10:22,083
And if I become a mother
in the next 6 months...

1067
01:10:22,561 --> 01:10:24,513
...will you still
think the same about me?

1068
01:10:24,735 --> 01:10:25,959
Absolutely...

1069
01:10:29,642 --> 01:10:30,822
Mother!

1070
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:34,392
Are you pregnant?

1071
01:10:36,194 --> 01:10:38,552
Why didn't you give
me this good news before?

1072
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,634
Chanda!

1073
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:14,502
"If my hands could reach the sky,"

1074
01:11:14,712 --> 01:11:19,863
"I would've laid down
stars at your feet."

1075
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:25,280
"If my hands could reach the sky,"

1076
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:30,539
"I would've laid down
stars at your feet."

1077
01:11:30,935 --> 01:11:35,967
"We would've gone
far away in fairyland"

1078
01:11:36,051 --> 01:11:41,534
"and made a house of love there."

1079
01:11:41,618 --> 01:11:46,780
"If my hands could reach the sky,"

1080
01:11:46,864 --> 01:11:52,086
"I would've laid down
moonlight at your step."

1081
01:11:52,358 --> 01:11:57,446
"We would've gone
far away in fairyland"

1082
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:02,911
"and made a house of love there."

1083
01:12:03,082 --> 01:12:08,282
"If my hands could reach the sky,"

1084
01:12:08,446 --> 01:12:14,096
"I would've laid down
stars at your feet."

1085
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:40,897
"We'll scatter buds everywhere."

1086
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:46,248
"These lanes will be filled
with aromas of flowers."

1087
01:12:46,331 --> 01:12:51,644
"We'll scatter buds everywhere."

1088
01:12:51,727 --> 01:12:57,093
"These lanes will be filled
with aromas of flowers."

1089
01:12:57,177 --> 01:13:02,457
"In these beautiful
and pleasant world"

1090
01:13:02,659 --> 01:13:08,009
"only the heart will
express their feelings."

1091
01:13:08,093 --> 01:13:13,688
"only the heart will
express their feelings."

1092
01:13:16,113 --> 01:13:21,327
"I would've made the
rays protect our courtyard"

1093
01:13:21,491 --> 01:13:27,492
"if my hands could reach the sky."

1094
01:13:53,733 --> 01:13:59,134
"Only the clouds of
loyalty would shower here."

1095
01:13:59,292 --> 01:14:04,577
"They will drench
us and make us mad."

1096
01:14:04,661 --> 01:14:09,989
"Only the clouds of loyalty
would shower over here."

1097
01:14:10,154 --> 01:14:15,317
"They will drench
us and make us mad."

1098
01:14:15,401 --> 01:14:20,796
"We'll spread the
blanket of spring here."

1099
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:26,141
"We'll spread the
fragrance of love here."

1100
01:14:26,224 --> 01:14:32,062
"We'll spread the
fragrance of love here."

1101
01:14:34,728 --> 01:14:39,746
"We would've made the
birds of happiness fly here,"

1102
01:14:39,829 --> 01:14:45,211
"If my hands could reach the sky,"

1103
01:14:45,294 --> 01:14:50,364
"We would've gone
far away in fairyland"

1104
01:14:50,447 --> 01:14:55,970
"and made a house of love there."

1105
01:14:56,054 --> 01:15:01,233
"if my hands could reach the sky."

1106
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:06,739
"I would've laid down
moonlight at your step."

1107
01:15:06,822 --> 01:15:12,085
"I would've laid down
the stars at your feet."

1108
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:17,425
"I would've laid down
moonlight at your step."

1109
01:15:17,509 --> 01:15:23,957
"I would've laid down
the stars at your feet."

1110
01:15:34,533 --> 01:15:38,180
Madam, these bangles look
so beautiful on your fair hands.

1111
01:15:38,808 --> 01:15:40,012
Take your money.

1112
01:15:40,654 --> 01:15:42,392
Dhano!

1113
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:44,170
Yes, madam. What's it?

1114
01:15:44,334 --> 01:15:46,239
Listen. Go to the tailor.

1115
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:48,034
He had promised to
give clothes today...

1116
01:15:48,117 --> 01:15:49,353
...but he has not brought it yet.

1117
01:15:49,533 --> 01:15:51,495
- What will I wear
for the festival? - Ok.

1118
01:15:51,766 --> 01:15:54,816
I'm taking lunch for
sir at the stone mines.

1119
01:15:54,899 --> 01:15:57,121
I'll bring the clothes
from the tailor while returning.

1120
01:15:57,984 --> 01:16:00,187
No, Dhano.
You'll not go to the mines.

1121
01:16:01,332 --> 01:16:03,407
Today I'll take food for him.

1122
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:07,899
You? How will you go so far
to the mines in this condition?

1123
01:16:08,032 --> 01:16:09,198
With my legs.

1124
01:16:09,521 --> 01:16:13,629
Today is our wedding anniversary.
I'll feed him today.

1125
01:16:15,806 --> 01:16:18,813
Mr. Ravi, I've placed the
bomb on the mountain. - Good.

1126
01:16:19,127 --> 01:16:21,416
Tell all the workers
to come on this side. Go.

1127
01:16:22,567 --> 01:16:24,903
Brothers, everybody come here.
The bomb is going to blast now.

1128
01:16:24,987 --> 01:16:27,258
- You too come.
- Let's go.

1129
01:16:27,341 --> 01:16:28,953
- Everybody has come.
- Fine.

1130
01:16:33,011 --> 01:16:35,438
Son Ravi, look there.

1131
01:16:36,456 --> 01:16:38,317
Chanda is coming from
that side of the mountain.

1132
01:16:38,952 --> 01:16:40,663
And the bomb is
going to blast there.

1133
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:45,716
Chanda, wait!

1134
01:16:45,799 --> 01:16:47,342
Daughter, wait!
The bomb is going to blast there.

1135
01:16:47,426 --> 01:16:49,289
Daughter, wait!

1136
01:16:50,776 --> 01:16:52,647
Wait, Chanda!

1137
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:55,206
- The bomb is going to blast now.
- Chanda, wait!

1138
01:16:57,039 --> 01:16:59,286
- Don't move ahead.
- Wait there.

1139
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:02,358
Chanda, wait!

1140
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:06,246
- Mr. Ravi.
- Chanda, wait!

1141
01:17:07,417 --> 01:17:08,989
Wait.

1142
01:17:09,839 --> 01:17:11,755
Chanda, run quickly!

1143
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,292
Wait!

1144
01:17:28,966 --> 01:17:30,410
Wait!

1145
01:17:40,062 --> 01:17:41,631
Chanda!

1146
01:17:43,003 --> 01:17:45,008
- Chanda!
- Chanda!

1147
01:17:51,076 --> 01:17:52,205
Chanda!

1148
01:17:52,477 --> 01:17:53,728
Chanda!

1149
01:17:53,854 --> 01:17:55,208
Sir, what has happened?

1150
01:17:55,629 --> 01:17:56,828
Get car quickly.

1151
01:17:56,912 --> 01:17:58,372
- No! - We'll take
her to the hospital.

1152
01:17:58,455 --> 01:17:59,854
- Go.
- No!

1153
01:18:00,163 --> 01:18:01,555
- No!
- Chanda!

1154
01:18:02,181 --> 01:18:05,113
- Chanda!
- My time is up.

1155
01:18:05,196 --> 01:18:07,187
No, Chanda. This cannot happen.

1156
01:18:08,265 --> 01:18:09,980
I have very less time.

1157
01:18:10,064 --> 01:18:12,616
- Listen to me...
- Chanda.

1158
01:18:13,165 --> 01:18:16,336
Give me a promise.

1159
01:18:16,857 --> 01:18:22,827
You will never separate
my father from you. - Never.

1160
01:18:23,795 --> 01:18:25,938
- His heart...
- Chanda!

1161
01:18:26,021 --> 01:18:28,766
His heart is like a kid.

1162
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,883
He... He will not be able to...

1163
01:18:32,665 --> 01:18:36,481
He will not be able to
bear the shock of my separation.

1164
01:18:36,564 --> 01:18:39,529
Chanda! Chanda! Chanda!

1165
01:18:39,613 --> 01:18:42,916
Please take care of him.

1166
01:18:43,669 --> 01:18:44,972
Yes Chanda!

1167
01:18:46,106 --> 01:18:51,503
Be with him anyway.

1168
01:18:51,734 --> 01:18:53,462
Promise me.

1169
01:18:54,339 --> 01:18:57,380
Promise me.
- I promise you Chanda that...

1170
01:18:57,463 --> 01:18:59,321
I will always be with him.

1171
01:19:00,213 --> 01:19:02,143
Chanda! Chanda!

1172
01:19:03,059 --> 01:19:04,263
Chanda!

1173
01:19:07,522 --> 01:19:16,072
"If my hands could reach the sky..."

1174
01:19:16,156 --> 01:19:25,650
"I would've laid down the stars at
your feet." - Chanda, my daughter!

1175
01:19:27,766 --> 01:19:31,134
My daughter!
Sir, what has happened?

1176
01:19:34,852 --> 01:19:35,996
Move!

1177
01:19:37,438 --> 01:19:39,329
Enough! Well done!

1178
01:20:06,776 --> 01:20:08,023
Son Ravi.

1179
01:20:16,614 --> 01:20:18,605
'My decision is the ultimate one.'

1180
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:24,423
'But remember that you've
broken my desire and heart.'

1181
01:20:25,658 --> 01:20:27,461
'Even you'll never be happy.'

1182
01:20:28,537 --> 01:20:30,283
'Remember my word.'

1183
01:20:30,544 --> 01:20:32,413
'You'll never be happy.'

1184
01:20:38,137 --> 01:20:40,879
I cursed you that day unknowingly.

1185
01:20:42,205 --> 01:20:44,624
I didn't know it'll come true.

1186
01:20:45,832 --> 01:20:48,257
Please forgive me, son.

1187
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:55,284
Who can change the destiny, mother?

1188
01:20:58,273 --> 01:21:00,068
Chanda had to leave me.

1189
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,127
She has gone.

1190
01:21:03,748 --> 01:21:04,839
Son...

1191
01:21:06,211 --> 01:21:08,071
...forget the past.

1192
01:21:09,690 --> 01:21:11,699
Assume that it was your dream.

1193
01:21:12,715 --> 01:21:14,716
Now that you're awake
that dream has ended.

1194
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:19,301
Now start a new life again, son.

1195
01:21:19,823 --> 01:21:23,833
You'll not say anything now.
I won't let you be stubborn now.

1196
01:21:25,477 --> 01:21:27,562
You've to settle down again.

1197
01:21:28,922 --> 01:21:35,342
And if you refuse, I'll leave
you forever go on pilgrimage.

1198
01:21:35,848 --> 01:21:37,049
Mother!

1199
01:21:38,921 --> 01:21:40,766
What are you telling,
sister-in-law?

1200
01:21:41,639 --> 01:21:45,300
Chanda has departed from this
world, but not from Ravi's heart.

1201
01:21:46,387 --> 01:21:50,774
In this condition, shall
I tell Ravi to marry my daughter?

1202
01:21:51,465 --> 01:21:53,554
I can't be so shameless.

1203
01:21:53,889 --> 01:21:57,737
Sister-in-law, you're right.

1204
01:21:58,095 --> 01:22:00,838
This fool won't understand it.

1205
01:22:01,376 --> 01:22:03,251
She doesn't know how
to make pairs of cards.

1206
01:22:03,334 --> 01:22:05,088
Then how will she
make marriage pairs?

1207
01:22:06,017 --> 01:22:07,747
She always fears god.

1208
01:22:07,830 --> 01:22:11,223
If we'll do this,
god will do that and vice-versa.

1209
01:22:11,866 --> 01:22:13,926
Whatever god has to do,
he doesn't do that.

1210
01:22:14,235 --> 01:22:16,996
Then why will he waste
his time in stupid things?

1211
01:22:17,079 --> 01:22:18,269
You fool!

1212
01:22:20,094 --> 01:22:21,265
Sister-in-law,

1213
01:22:21,348 --> 01:22:24,105
please get my daughter married
to Ravi at any cost.

1214
01:22:24,514 --> 01:22:27,206
We're in a very pathetic condition.
We're bankrupt.

1215
01:22:27,437 --> 01:22:30,194
Look, how slim I've become!
My clothes are loose.

1216
01:22:30,678 --> 01:22:33,907
This shirt and sarong
doesn't fit me anymore.

1217
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:35,608
It slips off while walking.

1218
01:22:36,767 --> 01:22:39,193
But sister-in-law,
you've become returned very fat.

1219
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:41,581
Which flour were you eating there?
- Shut up!

1220
01:22:42,497 --> 01:22:45,251
Look, your bangles have
become so tight. Give it to me.

1221
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,778
I'll take it to the goldsmith
to make it bigger. - Get lost!

1222
01:22:48,075 --> 01:22:49,976
When I had left,
you were very cunning.

1223
01:22:50,059 --> 01:22:52,093
But now you've become
even more cunning.

1224
01:22:52,258 --> 01:22:56,278
Rogue! Zombie!
Leave my bangle and think of...

1225
01:22:56,569 --> 01:22:59,305
...a way to get my son
and your daughter married.

1226
01:22:59,543 --> 01:23:02,682
I've planned everything for that.

1227
01:23:05,006 --> 01:23:07,021
Uncle Gopal! How are you?

1228
01:23:07,104 --> 01:23:09,532
Not good, brother.

1229
01:23:09,615 --> 01:23:12,539
I'm thinking of committing suicide.

1230
01:23:12,818 --> 01:23:15,782
- My son-in-law has thrown
me out of his house. - Really?

1231
01:23:16,085 --> 01:23:17,293
But why?

1232
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,206
He said, 'lazybones...

1233
01:23:19,547 --> 01:23:22,762
...'the father-in-law who
stays in his son-in-law's house'

1234
01:23:22,845 --> 01:23:26,823
'is indeed very
shameless and rogue.'

1235
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:29,950
Now I'm not like
Mr. Ravi's father-in-law.

1236
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:34,098
God! Give such a foolish
son-in-law to everyone!

1237
01:23:39,158 --> 01:23:41,578
Pray to god for my welfare.

1238
01:23:42,847 --> 01:23:44,419
- Take this. - 10 rupees.

1239
01:23:44,502 --> 01:23:46,479
You had promised 50 rupees.

1240
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,314
You'll get half
on making the move...

1241
01:23:48,398 --> 01:23:49,950
...and the rest
when we win the game.

1242
01:23:50,034 --> 01:23:52,068
The game has just started.
Now leave.

1243
01:24:13,496 --> 01:24:15,221
- Sister-in-law!
- What's it?

1244
01:24:16,007 --> 01:24:19,599
I think it's time now
to play the last game of cards.

1245
01:24:20,557 --> 01:24:23,862
- Call some learned priest.
- For what?

1246
01:24:23,946 --> 01:24:26,858
An evil man has entered your house.

1247
01:24:27,526 --> 01:24:30,184
You can't win until
he leaves this house.

1248
01:24:30,268 --> 01:24:32,684
And there won't be any
peace or happiness in your house.

1249
01:24:34,128 --> 01:24:37,591
Arrange for his veneration
and drive him out fast. Out.

1250
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:40,789
2 evil people had
entered this house.

1251
01:24:41,192 --> 01:24:45,922
One of them has died. But the
other one is still hovering around.

1252
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:51,299
Your son won't act
sensibly till he's here.

1253
01:24:51,838 --> 01:24:54,853
And my daughter won't get married.

1254
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:59,631
So I'm telling you
to call some priest and...

1255
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:02,227
...drive this inauspicious
man out of this house.

1256
01:25:05,677 --> 01:25:10,175
I think this evil
man has understood us.

1257
01:25:11,627 --> 01:25:13,780
I can sacrifice my
life too for my son-in-law.

1258
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:19,888
If my departure can bring
joy in Ravi's sorrow life...

1259
01:25:21,996 --> 01:25:23,164
I'll leave.

1260
01:25:25,442 --> 01:25:26,597
Goodbye!

1261
01:25:38,203 --> 01:25:40,152
You! Wait!

1262
01:25:47,103 --> 01:25:52,547
"Our life makes us
face difficult stages."

1263
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:58,177
"It neither lets
you laugh nor cry."

1264
01:25:58,425 --> 01:26:04,064
"My destiny is angry with me."

1265
01:26:04,147 --> 01:26:12,396
"I've been thrown
out of my own house."

1266
01:26:13,094 --> 01:26:18,414
"Our life makes us
face difficult stages."

1267
01:26:18,766 --> 01:26:25,793
"Our life makes us
face difficult stages."

1268
01:26:28,264 --> 01:26:32,734
'There are 52 cards. There
are five's, six's and seven's.'

1269
01:26:32,900 --> 01:26:34,986
'They all are my brothers.'

1270
01:26:35,236 --> 01:26:37,432
'Listen to me, dear.'

1271
01:26:42,285 --> 01:26:43,700
What is going on?

1272
01:26:44,924 --> 01:26:47,940
Nothing. I was stuck.

1273
01:26:58,174 --> 01:26:59,840
Where is Chanda's picture?

1274
01:27:02,821 --> 01:27:04,600
Sister-in-law, answer him.

1275
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:06,726
- Your father-in-law took it.
- Yes.

1276
01:27:07,141 --> 01:27:09,473
Really? But where?

1277
01:27:11,231 --> 01:27:12,435
Where is father?

1278
01:27:12,732 --> 01:27:14,754
He returned to his village.

1279
01:27:15,222 --> 01:27:16,806
- Village?
- Yes.

1280
01:27:17,170 --> 01:27:18,653
I tried to stop him.

1281
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,488
But he said that...

1282
01:27:20,571 --> 01:27:22,951
...the person for whom I
used to stay here, is no more now.

1283
01:27:23,284 --> 01:27:25,411
Now I can't stay here.

1284
01:27:25,662 --> 01:27:28,210
- What? - Yes.
He said the same thing.

1285
01:27:28,456 --> 01:27:32,177
And he picked up Chanda's
picture and left.

1286
01:27:33,336 --> 01:27:34,898
I'll investigate it right now.

1287
01:27:35,196 --> 01:27:36,775
Wait, son!

1288
01:27:37,298 --> 01:27:39,041
Now what's the use of going there?

1289
01:27:39,551 --> 01:27:42,637
He came here for the
person whom you had married.

1290
01:27:43,179 --> 01:27:45,840
With her death your relationship
with him has ended too.

1291
01:27:46,622 --> 01:27:48,561
Yes. I'm right.

1292
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:53,377
Aren't we your relatives
that you're worried for a stranger?

1293
01:27:54,287 --> 01:27:56,568
- C'mon. Have food. Let him die!
- Mother!

1294
01:27:58,695 --> 01:28:01,698
If you'll say anything
against him even by mistake...

1295
01:28:02,357 --> 01:28:05,308
- I won't forgive you.
- O lord!

1296
01:28:05,577 --> 01:28:10,290
I think you must have
misbehaved with him...

1297
01:28:10,373 --> 01:28:11,882
...so he left this house.

1298
01:28:12,334 --> 01:28:16,415
If you are proved wrong,
I won't spare you.

1299
01:28:19,350 --> 01:28:20,574
O my god!

1300
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:35,420
Son Ravi, you?

1301
01:28:35,742 --> 01:28:38,733
Father, tell me
honestly what happened?

1302
01:28:39,496 --> 01:28:41,431
What did they tell you?
- No.

1303
01:28:41,721 --> 01:28:44,555
Nobody said anything.
Actually I came on my own.

1304
01:28:46,581 --> 01:28:47,910
But why?

1305
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:50,857
And how did this photograph break?

1306
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:53,658
There is no guarantee
of a human life.

1307
01:28:54,367 --> 01:28:56,081
After all,
this is only a photograph.

1308
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,855
Chanda's death had filled
our lives with sorrows.

1309
01:29:01,499 --> 01:29:04,127
In such state my presence
will remind you of Chanda.

1310
01:29:04,836 --> 01:29:07,297
And as per the traditions
it's better for me to stay here.

1311
01:29:07,547 --> 01:29:09,758
I don't believe in any traditions.

1312
01:29:10,467 --> 01:29:11,718
You've forgotten that...

1313
01:29:12,435 --> 01:29:14,971
Chanda gave your responsibility
to me while dying.

1314
01:29:15,722 --> 01:29:17,098
And I had promised her.

1315
01:29:18,396 --> 01:29:22,363
From that day, I don't consider
you my father-in-law, but father.

1316
01:29:23,563 --> 01:29:25,440
Respect the feelings
of a son, father.

1317
01:29:25,724 --> 01:29:29,027
- I do.
- No. You don't.

1318
01:29:29,527 --> 01:29:33,163
If you had, you wouldn't
have leave that place like that.

1319
01:29:34,783 --> 01:29:39,946
I tied nuptial chain
and married Chanda...

1320
01:29:40,587 --> 01:29:43,333
...to get a decent patron and...

1321
01:29:43,416 --> 01:29:45,299
...father like father-in-law.

1322
01:29:47,220 --> 01:29:50,524
I don't have anybody except
for you in this world, father.

1323
01:29:51,443 --> 01:29:53,093
Everybody is very mean here.

1324
01:29:53,968 --> 01:29:58,682
If you leave me, with whose support
and why will I live this life?

1325
01:29:58,765 --> 01:30:00,266
Don't say that, Ravi.

1326
01:30:00,850 --> 01:30:03,687
If I'm alive only for
you and your happiness.

1327
01:30:04,270 --> 01:30:06,947
I'll be happy only
if you come with me.

1328
01:30:09,202 --> 01:30:12,612
I'll come with you,
but I've one condition.

1329
01:30:12,696 --> 01:30:15,199
I accept all your conditions.
Let's go.

1330
01:30:17,375 --> 01:30:18,535
Listen, first.

1331
01:30:19,661 --> 01:30:24,249
My condition is that
you will marry Neha soon.

1332
01:30:25,604 --> 01:30:28,413
Father, what are you saying?

1333
01:30:28,766 --> 01:30:30,296
By bringing joy in your life...

1334
01:30:31,297 --> 01:30:33,594
...sorrow and grief will
automatically vanish, son.

1335
01:30:34,864 --> 01:30:36,386
And then Neha is a good girl.

1336
01:30:37,053 --> 01:30:39,008
She considers you her
husband since childhood.

1337
01:30:39,328 --> 01:30:40,640
I want you to marry Neha.

1338
01:30:40,765 --> 01:30:43,935
- But father... - Look, if you
respect for me even a little and...

1339
01:30:44,644 --> 01:30:49,315
...consider me your father,
fix the wedding date immediately.

1340
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:53,451
I'll come with you the
day you'll bring invitation card.

1341
01:30:54,494 --> 01:30:55,695
For Chanda's sake.

1342
01:31:02,710 --> 01:31:03,937
Master, I think...

1343
01:31:04,021 --> 01:31:07,445
- ...that you're eating
after many days. - What do you mean?

1344
01:31:07,716 --> 01:31:10,261
I mean that when a person
eats someone else's food...

1345
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:13,306
...and eats half and
spills half it means...

1346
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:16,518
...that the person has lost
his habit of eating. You take this.

1347
01:31:16,601 --> 01:31:18,019
- Yes. - I'll beg
another one and eat.

1348
01:31:18,103 --> 01:31:19,854
Colourless!

1349
01:31:19,938 --> 01:31:22,982
Colourless!
Hold your tongue, old hag!

1350
01:31:23,232 --> 01:31:25,860
My destiny has already ruined
my life and make is colourless.

1351
01:31:25,944 --> 01:31:27,633
And on top of that,
you're calling me colourless.

1352
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:30,996
- My name is Chaurangi.
- Yes. That same thing.

1353
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:33,451
Chaurangi or whatever?
What's there in the name?

1354
01:31:33,818 --> 01:31:35,203
Now dance joyfully.

1355
01:31:35,286 --> 01:31:38,658
You're going to become my relative
very soon. - I didn't get it.

1356
01:31:38,741 --> 01:31:41,519
Ravi has agreed to marry Neha.

1357
01:31:41,602 --> 01:31:43,003
Yes? Really!

1358
01:31:43,086 --> 01:31:44,531
Yes!

1359
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:46,715
What happens if he has agreed?

1360
01:31:46,798 --> 01:31:50,719
- This king has not yet agreed.
- Are you against this marriage?

1361
01:31:50,802 --> 01:31:54,364
Yes. I'm not a weak man.

1362
01:31:54,639 --> 01:31:56,808
- Even I've some conditions.
- Conditions?

1363
01:31:57,371 --> 01:32:00,037
- Scum! What conditions?
- I'll tell you.

1364
01:32:00,204 --> 01:32:03,203
- First transfer Ravi's
property in my name. - What?

1365
01:32:03,286 --> 01:32:05,734
Yes. Only then will this marriage
take place, or else I won't.

1366
01:32:05,942 --> 01:32:09,332
Get lost! You don't
deserve to get any property!

1367
01:32:09,639 --> 01:32:12,940
Do you think this marriage
won't take place if you disagree?

1368
01:32:13,277 --> 01:32:15,744
Who are you? A rotten stray dog!

1369
01:32:16,031 --> 01:32:18,204
I'll not even invite
you for the wedding.

1370
01:32:18,655 --> 01:32:21,651
You'll be standing afar
like beggars and watch it.

1371
01:32:21,905 --> 01:32:23,918
And the wedding celebrations
will take place here.

1372
01:32:24,109 --> 01:32:26,504
I'll make this wedding possible.

1373
01:32:29,994 --> 01:32:34,262
Master, I accept your mouth
isn't used to eating. But...

1374
01:32:34,584 --> 01:32:36,965
...has it lost the
habit of speaking too?

1375
01:32:37,172 --> 01:32:38,308
- What?
- Then what?

1376
01:32:38,391 --> 01:32:39,726
You're boasting very much.

1377
01:32:39,809 --> 01:32:42,645
A crow should fly,
but not as high as an airplane.

1378
01:32:42,854 --> 01:32:44,475
Or else if it's wings
are clipped in the sky...

1379
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:46,191
...it'll fall down
and die like a rat.

1380
01:32:46,441 --> 01:32:49,903
What do you mean?
- I mean agree with that old hag.

1381
01:32:50,133 --> 01:32:54,238
If you disagree for this wedding,
your condition will be like me.

1382
01:32:54,667 --> 01:32:57,494
You beg for alms.
You call out in the lanes like...

1383
01:32:57,577 --> 01:33:00,039
"Mother!"

1384
01:33:00,662 --> 01:33:03,326
"Mother!"

1385
01:33:04,221 --> 01:33:06,409
"Mother!"

1386
01:33:06,704 --> 01:33:09,424
"Mother!"

1387
01:33:10,775 --> 01:33:15,053
Master! Started
begging in your dreams?

1388
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:17,697
No. Sister-in-law!

1389
01:33:17,930 --> 01:33:21,505
I agree to this marriage.
Print the wedding cards fast.

01:33:26,278 --> 01:33:27,512

[CHANTING]

1394
01:33:31,378 --> 01:33:32,602
Yes, son.

1395
01:33:32,874 --> 01:33:34,642
This is the invitation
card of my wedding.

1396
01:33:37,338 --> 01:33:38,496
Bless you, son!

1397
01:33:39,704 --> 01:33:42,056
Now I respect you even more.

1398
01:33:47,363 --> 01:33:48,514
What's this?

1399
01:33:49,421 --> 01:33:53,875
Why did you write my
name on the invitee's place?

1400
01:33:54,364 --> 01:33:58,520
Father, you're the
elder of my family.

1401
01:33:59,255 --> 01:34:00,732
That's why I gave your name.

1402
01:34:01,082 --> 01:34:05,231
But son, won't your relatives
feel bad after reading...

1403
01:34:05,696 --> 01:34:07,689
...the name of a small
and poor man like me?

1404
01:34:08,676 --> 01:34:12,667
Father, neither
you're small nor poor.

1405
01:34:13,626 --> 01:34:16,735
I'm getting married only to
fulfil the promise I made to you.

1406
01:34:17,483 --> 01:34:20,582
I'll be very happy
if you come there.

1407
01:34:21,104 --> 01:34:23,049
I don't care if nobody
else comes there.

1408
01:34:24,273 --> 01:34:28,013
I'm very lucky...

1409
01:34:29,056 --> 01:34:31,754
...to have a
person like you as my son-in-law.

1410
01:34:32,877 --> 01:34:36,548
You're not only my
son-in-law but my son too.

1411
01:34:37,801 --> 01:34:39,102
Be happy!

1413
01:34:45,240 --> 01:34:47,218
Be happy!

[CHANTING]

1415
01:34:50,711 --> 01:34:52,256
- Neha!
- No, son.

1416
01:34:54,559 --> 01:34:56,387
The world has unnecessarily
made a custom...

1417
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:58,765
...to seek elders' blessings
after the wedding.

1418
01:35:00,137 --> 01:35:02,503
Neha respects me a lot, but...

1419
01:35:02,895 --> 01:35:04,794
...she doesn't wants to
show it in front of others.

1420
01:35:05,278 --> 01:35:06,847
My blessings are with both of you.

1421
01:35:07,349 --> 01:35:09,758
Janki, I'm very happy today.

1422
01:35:10,654 --> 01:35:12,664
The biggest responsibility
of Neha's wedding...

1423
01:35:12,748 --> 01:35:14,156
...has been fulfilled.

1424
01:35:14,393 --> 01:35:17,262
Now I will enjoy myself
throughout my life.

1425
01:35:18,019 --> 01:35:22,225
"If they've lots of money,"

1426
01:35:22,562 --> 01:35:27,404
"they gulp down the
entire keg of booze."

1427
01:35:28,157 --> 01:35:31,552
"If they're penniless,"

1428
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:35,995
"they just smell the booze."

1429
01:35:36,643 --> 01:35:40,002
Wow, master!
What a beautiful verse!

1430
01:35:40,085 --> 01:35:42,139
Shut up! You're neither
drinking nor serving drink.

1431
01:35:42,222 --> 01:35:44,808
You're creating din
for no reason, stupid!

1432
01:36:12,461 --> 01:36:15,767
"Come, master!"

1433
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:19,800
"Let's start drinking booze."

1434
01:36:19,884 --> 01:36:23,638
"Let's start drinking
heavily today."

1435
01:36:23,722 --> 01:36:31,890
"God knows if we'll
get booze again or not."

1436
01:36:31,974 --> 01:36:35,066
"Come, master.
Let's start drinking booze."

1437
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:38,972
"Let's start drinking
heavily today."

1438
01:36:39,056 --> 01:36:47,420
"God knows if we'll
get booze again or not."

1439
01:37:09,726 --> 01:37:17,613
"My heart prays for a
bar behind my house."

1440
01:37:17,945 --> 01:37:21,738
"We should daily visit that place."

1441
01:37:21,822 --> 01:37:25,549
"We should daily visit that place."

1442
01:37:29,538 --> 01:37:33,208
"I'm thirsty for booze
since 2 days."

1443
01:37:33,291 --> 01:37:37,016
"Satiate my thirst and
do a good deed."

1444
01:37:37,099 --> 01:37:40,852
"Give us booze to drink."

1445
01:37:40,935 --> 01:37:44,726
"Give us booze to drink."

1446
01:37:45,884 --> 01:37:49,571
"If we'll drink a little,"

1447
01:37:49,655 --> 01:37:53,067
"we'll bless you."

1448
01:37:53,369 --> 01:37:55,272
"May your kids live long!"

1449
01:37:55,355 --> 01:37:57,190
"May they grow up and drink booze!"

1450
01:37:57,274 --> 01:38:04,560
"God knows if we'll
get booze again or not."

1451
01:38:05,386 --> 01:38:08,528
"Let's start drinking booze."

1452
01:38:08,611 --> 01:38:12,459
"Let's start drinking
heavily today."

1453
01:38:12,542 --> 01:38:20,871
"God knows if we'll
get booze again or not."

1454
01:39:00,677 --> 01:39:08,748
"When we'll die,
mourn for us, friends."

1455
01:39:08,832 --> 01:39:12,464
"Drink booze and give
it to everybody else."

1456
01:39:12,548 --> 01:39:16,373
"Drink booze and give
it to everybody else."

1457
01:39:20,236 --> 01:39:27,364
"Call the drunkards and tell
them to bathe us with booze."

1458
01:39:27,620 --> 01:39:31,372
"Cremate us in the bar."

1459
01:39:31,455 --> 01:39:35,094
"Cremate us in the bar."

1460
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:39,892
"May our ashes"

1461
01:39:39,975 --> 01:39:43,681
"always remain in the bar!"

1462
01:39:43,765 --> 01:39:47,528
"We'll be born in
wine-bearer's house again."

1463
01:39:47,611 --> 01:39:55,559
"God knows if we'll
get booze again or not."

1464
01:39:55,642 --> 01:39:58,854
"Come, master.
Let's start drinking booze."

1465
01:39:58,937 --> 01:40:02,601
"Let's start drinking
heavily today."

1466
01:40:02,684 --> 01:40:10,467
"God knows if we'll
get booze again or not."

1467
01:41:46,317 --> 01:41:47,796
What are you doing?

1468
01:41:48,002 --> 01:41:49,967
Stop!

1469
01:41:51,037 --> 01:41:54,096
For god's sake, wait! I beg of you.

1470
01:41:54,179 --> 01:41:56,679
Wait! What is going on?

1471
01:41:56,906 --> 01:41:59,248
- Look, sister-in-law
- What are you doing?

1472
01:42:02,559 --> 01:42:03,728
I don't know who they are?

1473
01:42:03,812 --> 01:42:04,980
They entered our
house suddenly and...

1474
01:42:05,063 --> 01:42:06,773
...started throwing the
house items outside.

1475
01:42:06,857 --> 01:42:09,317
They say now this house
belongs to them, not us.

1476
01:42:09,526 --> 01:42:11,917
Why? Who said that
this house belongs to you?

1477
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,905
Why are you getting angry on us?

1478
01:42:13,989 --> 01:42:17,117
Ask Chaurangi Lal. He has
sold this house to our boss.

1479
01:42:17,200 --> 01:42:18,504
- Really?
- Yes.

1480
01:42:19,202 --> 01:42:22,314
What's it, Chaurangi?
Have you sold the house?

1481
01:42:22,786 --> 01:42:24,749
Why are you sitting depressed?
Tell me.

1482
01:42:25,542 --> 01:42:28,462
I didn't have any other option,
sister-in-law.

1483
01:42:28,962 --> 01:42:31,422
I've was in a huge debt by
bearing Janki's expenses...

1484
01:42:31,505 --> 01:42:35,257
...throughout my life, so creditors
started harassing me.

1485
01:42:35,677 --> 01:42:37,804
On top of that I had
to get Neha married.

1486
01:42:37,888 --> 01:42:40,208
From where will I bring the money?
So I've sold the house.

1487
01:42:41,183 --> 01:42:45,312
You've not spent even a
penny on Neha's wedding.

1488
01:42:45,395 --> 01:42:47,939
Ravi and sister-in-law
has borne all the expenses.

1489
01:42:48,023 --> 01:42:51,678
- What have you spent?
- You want to know?

1490
01:42:52,152 --> 01:42:55,158
If you'll read this list,
you'll go mad.

1491
01:42:55,758 --> 01:43:00,167
There are more expenses during
wedding than the cards in my deck.

1492
01:43:00,553 --> 01:43:03,663
Now that we've lost our house
where will we take shelter?

1493
01:43:03,914 --> 01:43:07,467
They've become homeless.
Now where will they get shelter?

1494
01:43:08,210 --> 01:43:10,572
Listen to me.
Let them stay in our house.

1495
01:43:12,339 --> 01:43:16,035
What will the villagers think
if you don't support them now?

1496
01:43:16,908 --> 01:43:20,456
I request you to call
them to your house, son.

1497
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:24,219
- Now where will we go to find
a shelter? - You won't go anywhere.

1498
01:43:25,393 --> 01:43:27,449
You'll stay in our house now.

1499
01:43:28,419 --> 01:43:32,685
- God has come here!
- Come.

1500
01:43:57,766 --> 01:43:59,773
'They didn't get
up after seeing me!'

1501
01:44:00,684 --> 01:44:02,890
No. Be seated.

1502
01:44:03,172 --> 01:44:04,467
They're already sitting.
Who is standing?

1503
01:44:04,635 --> 01:44:05,973
Shut up, beggar!

1504
01:44:06,719 --> 01:44:09,110
When the poor don't get up after
seeing a rich man...

1505
01:44:09,193 --> 01:44:10,922
...you've to say that.

1506
01:44:11,114 --> 01:44:12,132
Beggar!

1507
01:44:12,425 --> 01:44:14,187
- Greetings!
- Salutations!

1508
01:44:14,353 --> 01:44:15,825
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

1509
01:44:15,969 --> 01:44:18,530
You didn't stand on seeing
me before. You are standing now.

1510
01:44:19,183 --> 01:44:20,887
- Look.
- Just turn around.

1511
01:44:21,681 --> 01:44:23,981
Oh god! Son-in-law, you!

1512
01:44:24,321 --> 01:44:27,868
I thought they're standing
to welcome me with respect.

1513
01:44:29,660 --> 01:44:30,838
Brothers...

1514
01:44:31,768 --> 01:44:34,476
I've called you here
to inform you that...

1515
01:44:35,542 --> 01:44:42,228
...now the responsibility of my
entire business and property...

1516
01:44:42,897 --> 01:44:44,523
...will be in my
father-in-law's hand.

1517
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:46,240
Ok.

1518
01:44:46,385 --> 01:44:49,267
He'll take care of everything now.

1519
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:57,994
Father.

1520
01:45:03,279 --> 01:45:06,464
No. What are you doing, son?

1521
01:45:06,841 --> 01:45:08,591
I'm giving your
responsibility to you.

1522
01:45:09,431 --> 01:45:11,439
- Take care of it.
- No, son.

1523
01:45:12,218 --> 01:45:14,914
I'll take care of all those
responsibilities. That is my duty.

1524
01:45:15,944 --> 01:45:19,120
But I won't take
care of these keys.

1525
01:45:20,515 --> 01:45:21,523
Look father...

1526
01:45:22,305 --> 01:45:24,959
...this is the matter our property,
business and respect.

1527
01:45:25,786 --> 01:45:30,082
I know very well to whom
I should hand it over.

1528
01:45:32,087 --> 01:45:33,266
Take this.

1529
01:45:37,179 --> 01:45:38,454
Everybody do your work now.

1530
01:45:38,537 --> 01:45:39,806
- Yes.
- Greetings!

1531
01:45:40,667 --> 01:45:42,893
Father, I'll return from the city.

1532
01:45:43,297 --> 01:45:44,681
Son, even I'll go to the farm.

1533
01:45:50,984 --> 01:45:53,404
Man! What are you doing?

1534
01:45:53,668 --> 01:45:55,605
What do you think?
Can't you get it?

1535
01:45:55,951 --> 01:45:57,033
I won't leave him!

1536
01:45:57,116 --> 01:45:58,370
Shankar!

1537
01:45:59,336 --> 01:46:02,802
I'll not spare that Shankar today.

1538
01:46:04,783 --> 01:46:06,176
Agent!

1539
01:46:07,014 --> 01:46:10,438
Shankar! Come outside.

1540
01:46:11,356 --> 01:46:16,363
Pauper of another village!
Come outside.

1541
01:46:16,447 --> 01:46:19,686
Are you coming out or
shall I come inside?

1542
01:46:20,049 --> 01:46:21,443
What is this madness?

1543
01:46:21,796 --> 01:46:24,238
Why are you disturbing this
society after getting drunk?

1544
01:46:24,321 --> 01:46:30,033
May this society and
you go to hell! Get lost.

1545
01:46:31,462 --> 01:46:33,819
You! Come out.

1546
01:46:34,182 --> 01:46:37,582
Or I'll start abusing your
mother and sister. Come out.

1547
01:46:37,803 --> 01:46:39,513
Mr. Chaurangi Lal,
what are you doing?

1548
01:46:40,055 --> 01:46:42,641
You've abusing outside the
house after getting drunk!

1549
01:46:42,803 --> 01:46:47,239
- What will son-in-law say?
- How come he's your son-in-law?

1550
01:46:47,772 --> 01:46:51,775
C'mon. Give the keys to me fast.

1551
01:46:51,858 --> 01:46:53,744
- Listen.
- Get lost!

1552
01:46:54,173 --> 01:46:56,238
Listen, Mr. Chaurangi Lal.
If you want the keys...

1553
01:46:56,793 --> 01:46:57,892
...ask your son-in-law.

1554
01:46:58,264 --> 01:47:00,625
If he tells me, I'll
give the keys to you.

1555
01:47:00,709 --> 01:47:04,931
Who is he to give that order?

1556
01:47:05,701 --> 01:47:08,682
This important person
is ordering you.

1557
01:47:09,300 --> 01:47:12,354
Give the keys fast.

1558
01:47:12,642 --> 01:47:14,297
Look, if you want, you can kill me.

1559
01:47:14,549 --> 01:47:17,111
But I'll not give you the keys
without son-in-law's permission.

1560
01:47:17,194 --> 01:47:20,533
- You won't give me the keys?
- No.

1561
01:47:20,616 --> 01:47:23,935
- Not even if I lose my life.
- I'll break your head.

1562
01:47:24,019 --> 01:47:25,230
Wait!

1563
01:47:26,211 --> 01:47:27,337
What is going on?

1564
01:47:27,495 --> 01:47:29,231
You're bullying
after getting drunk!

1565
01:47:29,702 --> 01:47:32,160
You're threatening a decent man!
Don't you feel ashamed?

1566
01:47:32,407 --> 01:47:36,100
You've forced me
to become shameless.

1567
01:47:36,271 --> 01:47:38,997
You're my son-in-law and
I'm your father-in-law.

1568
01:47:39,475 --> 01:47:42,950
But why is this outsider
interfering between us?

1569
01:47:43,493 --> 01:47:47,622
Who is he that you've given
the entire responsibility to him?

1570
01:47:47,706 --> 01:47:49,124
This is my wish.

1571
01:47:49,541 --> 01:47:52,125
Who are you to interfere
in my personal matters?

1572
01:47:52,379 --> 01:47:56,823
Look, I know all the rules
of the court.

1573
01:47:57,614 --> 01:47:59,924
As per the law, all
this property belongs...

1574
01:48:00,270 --> 01:48:02,802
...to your wife that means
to my daughter.

1575
01:48:03,018 --> 01:48:07,660
If you'll not give it, I'll go to
the High court and Supreme court.

1576
01:48:08,095 --> 01:48:14,314
I'll go to the parliament
and ask for my property.

1577
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:19,817
Everything belongs to me,
but he is enjoying it.

1578
01:48:20,551 --> 01:48:23,416
- Give me my share back.
- Then go.

1579
01:48:24,359 --> 01:48:26,552
Go to the parliament
and ask for your share.

1580
01:48:27,261 --> 01:48:29,580
The prime minister
will give it to you.

1581
01:48:29,663 --> 01:48:32,052
- In the parliament...
- Get lost!

1582
01:48:32,136 --> 01:48:35,216
Did you push me?
Your own father-in-law!

1583
01:48:35,299 --> 01:48:37,212
Saw? He pushed his father-in-law?

1584
01:48:37,397 --> 01:48:38,910
You're pushing an elderly person.

1585
01:48:38,993 --> 01:48:41,431
You're listening to him
and pushing me.

1586
01:48:41,515 --> 01:48:47,634
Don't dare let this imbecile
drunkard step into my house again.

1587
01:48:50,006 --> 01:48:51,234
Let's go, father.

1588
01:48:54,668 --> 01:48:58,319
Sister-in-law, did you see
how your son insulted me?

1589
01:48:58,618 --> 01:49:01,556
It happened because of
that old man, Shankar.

1590
01:49:01,639 --> 01:49:03,673
Please explain to him.

1591
01:49:03,757 --> 01:49:05,643
[CRYING]

1592
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,585
Did that old woman left?
Stupid hag!

1593
01:49:09,668 --> 01:49:12,484
[CRYING]

1594
01:49:12,882 --> 01:49:14,388
Janki!

1595
01:49:14,472 --> 01:49:18,354
Heard what they said about me?
Go and explain them.

1596
01:49:18,437 --> 01:49:21,660
Are you leaving me too? Janki!

1597
01:49:24,687 --> 01:49:29,230
Everyone left and I'm standing
alone like a stray dog.

1598
01:49:31,016 --> 01:49:32,866
Why are you staring at me?

1599
01:49:34,388 --> 01:49:36,305
They've thrown me out of the house.

1600
01:49:36,682 --> 01:49:39,086
I'll throw you out of the village.

1601
01:49:39,606 --> 01:49:41,859
Get lost. - Let's go. C'mon.
Don't watch the show!

1602
01:50:11,229 --> 01:50:14,499
From where did this
air filled mattress come?

1603
01:50:15,638 --> 01:50:18,058
Get up, master.

1604
01:50:18,247 --> 01:50:21,180
Have some hot tea.

1605
01:50:24,524 --> 01:50:27,144
Hot tea for me
early in the morning!

1606
01:50:27,337 --> 01:50:29,271
And that too with so much respect.

1607
01:50:30,100 --> 01:50:31,893
Wow, lame!

1608
01:50:32,018 --> 01:50:35,551
You're just limb by your body,
but you've a big heart.

1609
01:50:35,634 --> 01:50:37,947
You're great! I salute you!

1610
01:50:38,030 --> 01:50:40,282
Salute, me? Why?

1611
01:50:40,366 --> 01:50:43,494
Because you've brought hot
tea for me.

1612
01:50:43,619 --> 01:50:46,919
Give. I didn't get tea since
2 days. - Master!

1613
01:50:47,979 --> 01:50:51,544
This tea isn't for you, but for me.

1614
01:50:52,337 --> 01:50:54,796
Yes. He's my secretary.

1615
01:50:55,715 --> 01:50:58,382
- What?
- Yes. - Greetings!

1616
01:50:58,507 --> 01:51:01,705
Secretary, didn't you bring
today's newspaper for me?

1617
01:51:04,102 --> 01:51:07,601
- Hindi? - The English newspaper
isn't in the market yet.

1618
01:51:07,734 --> 01:51:10,024
So I brought Hindi newspaper, sir.

1619
01:51:10,164 --> 01:51:11,684
Fine, sit afar.

1620
01:51:12,315 --> 01:51:16,965
I enjoy reading the
newspaper by sipping tea.

1621
01:51:17,333 --> 01:51:20,524
And I don't see stupid
people while drinking tea.

1622
01:51:21,227 --> 01:51:25,363
Look at this. Now you
just read the newspaper.

1623
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:28,539
And if you pronounce
even one word wrong,

1624
01:51:28,622 --> 01:51:31,336
I'll force this stick
into your mouth.

1625
01:51:32,413 --> 01:51:34,879
Don't worry. This poor fellow has
become mad due to family tensions.

1626
01:51:35,004 --> 01:51:36,213
- He will...
- What are you saying?

1627
01:51:36,297 --> 01:51:37,798
I'm ordering meal.

1628
01:51:37,882 --> 01:51:40,384
Secretary, go to the
Royal hotel and...

1629
01:51:40,468 --> 01:51:45,453
...get some special leftover
fried bread, mutton and fried rice.

1630
01:51:45,536 --> 01:51:48,811
Ok, sir. Do I beg something
for you too?

1631
01:51:49,128 --> 01:51:52,743
Stupid lame! Will you go or
shall I break even your other leg?

1632
01:51:54,322 --> 01:51:56,651
- He became alright!
- He's a part time lame.

1633
01:51:56,734 --> 01:51:58,072
After reaching the road,
he'll become blind.

1634
01:51:58,155 --> 01:51:59,355
When will you go blind?

1635
01:51:59,439 --> 01:52:00,633
- Tomorrow.
- Oh god!

1636
01:52:00,716 --> 01:52:02,740
You've lost everything
but not your arrogance.

1637
01:52:02,968 --> 01:52:05,338
What's going on in front
of our house in the morning?

1638
01:52:05,502 --> 01:52:07,472
Look at my condition.

1639
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:10,539
Even these stupid beggars
are mocking me.

1640
01:52:10,623 --> 01:52:11,824
- Look...
- Shut up!

1641
01:52:12,458 --> 01:52:15,628
Janki, tell son-in-law
to let me come inside.

1642
01:52:15,711 --> 01:52:18,593
I promise you I'll not
misbehave again.

1643
01:52:18,677 --> 01:52:20,494
And I even promise

1644
01:52:20,706 --> 01:52:24,379
That in my next birth,
I'll be only your husband.

1645
01:52:24,463 --> 01:52:28,727
Not at all. I'm tired of
you in this life only.

1646
01:52:28,888 --> 01:52:31,519
- I agree to become an animal
in my next life. - Really?

1647
01:52:31,602 --> 01:52:34,246
- But I don't want to be your wife.
- Why?

1648
01:52:34,330 --> 01:52:35,776
- And listen.
- Yes.

1649
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:38,151
- I want to improve my
daughter's life. - Yes.

1650
01:52:38,235 --> 01:52:40,736
I can't put her life
at stake because of you.

1651
01:52:41,037 --> 01:52:44,861
So I'll not tell son-in-law
to take you inside the house.

1652
01:52:44,945 --> 01:52:46,123
No. Just listen...

1653
01:52:46,866 --> 01:52:49,642
Janki, at least give me
one cup of tea.

1654
01:52:49,996 --> 01:52:51,265
O god!

1655
01:52:51,772 --> 01:52:53,416
Even this beggar gets tea here...

1656
01:52:58,447 --> 01:53:02,772
It is good that the
evil person left. O god!

1657
01:53:04,468 --> 01:53:05,610
Listen.

1658
01:53:07,316 --> 01:53:08,733
This fool is still here.

1659
01:53:08,816 --> 01:53:11,909
Last night when you were
lying down on the road...

1660
01:53:11,993 --> 01:53:14,731
...I thought that you've lost
respect as a father-in-law.

1661
01:53:15,301 --> 01:53:18,211
But now I've know that you've
lost respect as a husband too.

1662
01:53:18,773 --> 01:53:21,599
Your position is worse
than my limb secretary.

1663
01:53:21,682 --> 01:53:23,253
- Listen to me. - Yes.
Please sit afar.

1664
01:53:23,336 --> 01:53:27,992
- My reputation is being affected.
- Rascal! I'll not spare you!

1665
01:53:28,075 --> 01:53:32,330
- Give me something, sir.
- Give me food.

1666
01:53:32,413 --> 01:53:34,198
- Bony!
- What's it?

1667
01:53:34,281 --> 01:53:35,668
Come here.

1668
01:53:36,089 --> 01:53:37,645
- What is this?
- 10 paisa.

1669
01:53:37,729 --> 01:53:39,464
- For what?
- I've given it as alms.

1670
01:53:39,768 --> 01:53:40,939
- Alms?
- Yes.

1671
01:53:41,023 --> 01:53:43,900
These days you can't buy
even dirt for 10 paisa.

1672
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:45,495
And you're giving me
10 paisa as alms!

1673
01:53:45,739 --> 01:53:47,195
We donate more money than this.

1674
01:53:48,234 --> 01:53:49,703
Take 1 rupee from me.

1675
01:53:49,851 --> 01:53:54,291
Drink tea and bless my kids
who are not yet born. Go!

1676
01:53:55,444 --> 01:53:58,286
Stupid! He's ruining the
reputation of beggars.

1677
01:53:58,613 --> 01:54:00,559
Imbeciles! Shameless!

1678
01:54:01,438 --> 01:54:03,941
Who are you?
Master, you?

1679
01:54:04,259 --> 01:54:06,518
What are you doing in the
beggar's line without a license?

1680
01:54:06,746 --> 01:54:09,167
Beggar! I'm not here to beg!

1681
01:54:09,541 --> 01:54:11,710
Then are you in beggar's
place to offer charity.

1682
01:54:11,793 --> 01:54:14,254
- My daughter Neha has gone inside.
- Really?

1683
01:54:14,337 --> 01:54:15,797
- I've come to meet her.
- To beg?

1684
01:54:15,880 --> 01:54:17,827
- No!
- There she is.

1685
01:54:19,781 --> 01:54:22,928
- Mother, just give me 5 rupees.
- Daughter

1686
01:54:26,249 --> 01:54:27,881
Father, you?

1687
01:54:28,935 --> 01:54:30,220
What are you doing here?

1688
01:54:30,437 --> 01:54:33,440
I was waiting for you.

1689
01:54:33,815 --> 01:54:35,025
I've been ruined.

1690
01:54:35,358 --> 01:54:37,986
Son-in-law has thrown me
out of the house. I'm hungry.

1691
01:54:38,153 --> 01:54:40,155
I don't have any support.
Do something.

1692
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:42,490
Please tell Ravi and
take me inside the house.

1693
01:54:42,574 --> 01:54:45,368
He won't refuse you
because you're his wife.

1694
01:54:46,619 --> 01:54:48,325
- No, father.
- Why?

1695
01:54:48,872 --> 01:54:51,829
Because he has still not
given me the position of a wife.

1696
01:54:52,375 --> 01:54:53,632
What?

1697
01:54:54,586 --> 01:54:55,962
What are you saying?

1698
01:54:56,856 --> 01:54:58,358
I'm saying the truth.

1699
01:54:58,715 --> 01:55:00,837
He hasn't even spoken
properly to me until today.

1700
01:55:01,192 --> 01:55:03,829
In such conditions,
how can I recommend you?

1701
01:55:04,681 --> 01:55:06,765
So this is the matter!

1702
01:55:07,182 --> 01:55:09,851
I can handle such
situations easily.

1703
01:55:09,934 --> 01:55:11,182
Don't worry. Go home.

1704
01:55:11,436 --> 01:55:13,229
Your life will change in the night.

1705
01:55:13,355 --> 01:55:14,522
I didn't get you.

1706
01:55:14,647 --> 01:55:16,563
Do as I tell you to.

1707
01:55:17,305 --> 01:55:21,119
He'll accept you and
forgive me too.

1708
01:56:26,774 --> 01:56:30,390
- "Come near me.
- No."

1709
01:56:30,635 --> 01:56:34,144
- "Look into my eyes.
- No."

1710
01:56:34,404 --> 01:56:38,008
- "Come near me.
- No."

1711
01:56:38,284 --> 01:56:42,021
- "Look into my eyes.
- No."

1712
01:56:42,284 --> 01:56:47,265
"My beloved, do you
remember that promise?"

1713
01:56:47,349 --> 01:56:51,494
"Yes. What is the need to say?"

1714
01:56:51,700 --> 01:56:55,248
- "Don't trouble me like this.
- No."

1715
01:56:55,331 --> 01:56:59,192
- "Control your heart.
- No."

1716
01:56:59,514 --> 01:57:04,512
"My beloved, do you
remember that promise?"

1717
01:57:04,637 --> 01:57:08,887

- "Look into my eyes.
- No."

1720
01:58:02,792 --> 01:58:06,085
"Read my eyes' gestures."

1721
01:58:06,466 --> 01:58:09,631
"Understand the language
of my heart."

1722
01:58:09,714 --> 01:58:16,387
"O my beloved! What is this magic?"

1723
01:58:18,018 --> 01:58:21,793
"The atmosphere is
also very pleasant."

1724
01:58:21,984 --> 01:58:25,057
"It is explaining something to me."

1725
01:58:25,140 --> 01:58:31,783
"This intoxication
is spread everywhere."

1726
01:58:31,867 --> 01:58:35,533
"Don't try to trap me
with your sweet talks."

1727
01:58:35,616 --> 01:58:39,216
- "Come near me.
- No."

"Your movements are charming."

01:59:36,378 --> 01:59:43,149
"I've come into your arms."

1732
01:59:44,623 --> 01:59:47,903
"The weather is seducing."

1733
01:59:48,363 --> 01:59:51,685
"Our desires are kindled."

1734
01:59:51,768 --> 01:59:57,999
"I've lost my heart on the way."

1735
01:59:58,369 --> 02:00:01,778
"Don't entice me with your styles."

1736
02:00:01,941 --> 02:00:05,546
- "Come near me.
- No."

1737
02:00:05,671 --> 02:00:09,377
- "Look into my eyes.
- No."

Listen...

1745
02:00:45,261 --> 02:00:47,761
...why are you ignoring
a woman's desires?

1746
02:00:48,408 --> 02:00:52,528
I don't ask you for any wealth,
jewelry or property.

1747
02:00:52,848 --> 02:00:55,131
I'm just asking for your love.

1748
02:00:55,749 --> 02:00:57,876
After all, even I'm a woman.

1749
02:01:00,109 --> 02:01:04,216
I've to beg to that old man
even to get ordinary medicine.

1750
02:01:05,916 --> 02:01:07,945
Mind your language first of all.

1751
02:01:08,971 --> 02:01:11,598
And if you feel shy to ask,
don't ask.

1752
02:01:11,682 --> 02:01:14,809
No. You'll have to remove that
old man from our house first.

1753
02:01:17,556 --> 02:01:18,786
What was this noise?

1754
02:01:19,162 --> 02:01:21,803
It was the noise of your idea.

1755
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:25,112
- Really. - And its echo has scared
the birds of the nearby villages.

1756
02:01:25,195 --> 02:01:26,481
- Congrats!
- Shut up!

1757
02:01:27,197 --> 02:01:32,056
By calling a noble person,
old man, you're insulting him.

1758
02:01:32,953 --> 02:01:34,278
And you're not speaking...

1759
02:01:35,455 --> 02:01:37,457
...but your father's wrong
teaching is speaking.

1760
02:01:40,335 --> 02:01:42,838
Today I'm warning you for
the first and the last time.

1761
02:01:44,006 --> 02:01:47,467
If you'll say anything
against father again...

1762
02:01:48,343 --> 02:01:53,102
...you can't even
what I'll do to you.

1763
02:01:53,557 --> 02:01:56,536
- Master, I'm very scared.
- Yes.

1764
02:01:58,312 --> 02:02:04,622
I feel as if slaps, kicks and
abuses are going to be showered.

1765
02:02:04,705 --> 02:02:06,820
- Yes. - So it's very
dangerous to sit here.

1766
02:02:06,903 --> 02:02:09,116
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1767
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:17,443
Pushpa!

1768
02:02:17,831 --> 02:02:21,362
Tomorrow come at the same time.
Then we'll play the game of love.

1769
02:02:21,585 --> 02:02:24,372
Do come, don't forget. Go.

1770
02:02:26,838 --> 02:02:29,118
Stupid old man! He's staring at us.

1771
02:02:29,477 --> 02:02:31,841
What are you staring at?
Haven't you seen me before?

1772
02:02:38,150 --> 02:02:40,035
Don't you feel embarrassed
to do this sin?

1773
02:02:40,922 --> 02:02:43,559
What if you become the mother
of his illegitimate child?

1774
02:02:44,290 --> 02:02:45,943
The entire village taunt you.

1775
02:02:46,502 --> 02:02:48,331
Then where will
you take that child?

1776
02:02:51,803 --> 02:02:53,241
What do I do, uncle?

1777
02:02:54,591 --> 02:02:58,678
He threatened me and
molested me forcefully.

1778
02:03:00,316 --> 02:03:05,371
And then he promised
me that if I accept him...

1779
02:03:06,339 --> 02:03:12,392
...he'll give me a farm with
water pump for cultivation.

1780
02:03:13,345 --> 02:03:14,953
And I...

02:03:29,278 --> 02:03:30,570
What's it? Why are you screaming?

1786
02:03:30,654 --> 02:03:32,327
Aunt, there is good news.

1787
02:03:32,656 --> 02:03:33,983
Sister is vomiting.

1788
02:03:34,491 --> 02:03:35,706
- Really?
- Yes.

1789
02:03:37,077 --> 02:03:39,746
Congrats, sister-in-law!
You're going to become a granny.

1790
02:03:40,539 --> 02:03:43,125
Wow! This means that
I'm going to be a grandfather.

1791
02:03:43,208 --> 02:03:44,841
Thanks a million, god.

1792
02:03:45,836 --> 02:03:49,131
Daughter... I used to dream about
a grandson daily.

1793
02:03:49,214 --> 02:03:50,549
Today you've fulfilled that dream.

1794
02:03:50,632 --> 02:03:52,968
I'll invite all the villagers
for lunch.

1795
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:55,415
I'll tell the confectioner
to make delicious sweets.

1796
02:03:55,499 --> 02:03:56,765
- In the entire village...
- Stop it!

1797
02:03:56,849 --> 02:04:00,167
Why are you so happy? Why do
you want to distribute sweets?

1798
02:04:02,060 --> 02:04:06,834
He has never accepted me as
a wife since our marriage.

1799
02:04:07,107 --> 02:04:08,939
He has never even touched me.

1800
02:04:09,484 --> 02:04:12,248
- We're husband and wife
for namesake. - What?

1801
02:04:14,778 --> 02:04:17,870
Daughter, why did you hide
this from me till today?

1802
02:04:18,534 --> 02:04:20,393
- Let him come home today.
- No, sister-in-law.

1803
02:04:21,050 --> 02:04:22,615
You'll not tell anything to Ravi.

1804
02:04:23,418 --> 02:04:25,488
It's a personal matter
of a husband and a wife.

1805
02:04:28,246 --> 02:04:29,425
Daughter...

1806
02:04:30,694 --> 02:04:32,709
...think deeply about
the circumstances...

1807
02:04:33,619 --> 02:04:36,004
...when Ravi married you.

1808
02:04:37,643 --> 02:04:41,551
Now it's up to you to
make him accept you.

1809
02:04:43,173 --> 02:04:45,871
You'll have to tolerate everything...

1810

...till old memories
aren't wiped out.

1811
02:04:50,484 --> 02:04:56,820
And by revealing the secrets
of your personal life like this...

1812
02:04:57,455 --> 02:04:59,694
...in front of everyone, you're
insulting your duty as a wife.

1813
02:04:59,777 --> 02:05:02,623
Then why did you put me
in this trap? Tell me.

1814
02:05:04,429 --> 02:05:06,136
My life has been ruined.

1815
02:05:08,143 --> 02:05:10,611
It's better to die than
live like this.

1816
02:05:10,932 --> 02:05:12,868

- I'm going to the village.
- Why?

1820
02:05:27,506 --> 02:05:29,161
Because you've not obeyed my order.

1821
02:05:30,093 --> 02:05:31,383
What order?

1822
02:05:32,391 --> 02:05:35,745
I didn't get you married with
Neha to fill her life with grief...

1823
02:05:36,201 --> 02:05:38,262
...and snatch the right from
her which she deserves.

1824
02:05:41,191 --> 02:05:42,591
Chanda has died.

1825
02:05:43,148 --> 02:05:44,676
She can't come back, right?

1826
02:05:45,321 --> 02:05:48,133
Then why are you ruining
Neha's life in her memory?

1827
02:05:48,344 --> 02:05:49,766
What's her fault?

1828
02:05:52,866 --> 02:05:57,106
You've always given only
happiness to others...

1829
02:05:57,573 --> 02:06:00,305
...so why are you filling
your wife's life with sorrow?

1830
02:06:02,203 --> 02:06:03,668
As far as I'm concerned...

1831
02:06:04,224 --> 02:06:08,329
I considered Neha as my
Chanda the day you married her.

1832
02:06:08,672 --> 02:06:10,077
Neha is my daughter.

1833

I can't see her cry in grief.

02:06:13,937 --> 02:06:16,125
- Father!
- I don't want to hear anything.

1835
02:06:16,545 --> 02:06:18,585
If you respect me a little...

1836
02:06:18,669 --> 02:06:20,661
You'll give the same
love and respect to Neha...

1837
02:06:20,745 --> 02:06:22,224

My daughter Chanda used to wear...

...this sari and jewellery.

1842

your love is a favour on me.

- No, daughter.

Don't get sad on seeing all this.

1865
02:08:52,391 --> 02:08:55,233
These sari and jewellery
belongs to sister Chanda.

1866
02:08:55,553 --> 02:08:57,860
Father told me to wear them.

1867
02:08:58,614 --> 02:09:01,662
If you feel bad, I'll take it off.

1868
02:09:24,014 --> 02:09:26,878
Brother Chaurangi, how did this
finger become crooked?

1869
02:09:27,225 --> 02:09:28,468
Scoundrel!

1870
02:09:29,337 --> 02:09:33,727
I went to eat chicken and fried
rice in Royal hotel last night.

1871
02:09:34,359 --> 02:09:37,582
After smelling the aroma of
the food a dog followed me.

1872
02:09:37,779 --> 02:09:39,503
I ran and that dog chased me.

1873
02:09:39,723 --> 02:09:42,217
I fell down and wounded my finger.

1874
02:09:42,822 --> 02:09:43,976
Consult a doctor fast.

1875
02:09:44,060 --> 02:09:46,868
It could deteriorate and
cause leprosy. - Leprosy?

1876
02:09:48,014 --> 02:09:49,903
What is your intention?

1877
02:09:49,986 --> 02:09:51,727
Nothing, Mr. Chaurangi. - You've
already thrown me out of the house.

1878
02:09:51,810 --> 02:09:54,041
And by saying leprosy do you intend
to throw me out of the village?

1879
02:09:54,125 --> 02:09:55,697
- No. I didn't say that.
It is strange. - Get lost!

1880
02:09:55,925 --> 02:09:57,429
You're acting too smart!

1881
02:09:58,089 --> 02:09:59,881
You may be suffering from leprosy.

1882
02:10:01,387 --> 02:10:02,517
What happened to you?

1883
02:10:02,600 --> 02:10:03,780
Father!

1884
02:10:04,044 --> 02:10:05,676
- Father!
- What's it, daughter?

1885
02:10:05,911 --> 02:10:07,973
I'm not calling you, but father.

1886
02:10:08,438 --> 02:10:09,593
Father!

1887
02:10:12,846 --> 02:10:14,069
What's it, daughter?

1888
02:10:14,152 --> 02:10:15,384
Return soon from the farm.

1889
02:10:15,467 --> 02:10:17,800
- I've to go to the market with you.
- Ok.

1890
02:10:24,465 --> 02:10:26,959
Listen. Hold out your hands.

1891
02:10:30,574 --> 02:10:31,705
What is this?

1892
02:10:31,789 --> 02:10:33,548
I'm training you to beg.

1893
02:10:34,487 --> 02:10:37,136
Your life is like that filthy hut...

1894
02:10:37,219 --> 02:10:41,115
...which doesn't has a roof,
floor or any wall.

1895
02:10:41,545 --> 02:10:43,424
What is left in your life?

1896
02:10:43,968 --> 02:10:46,544
You were spurned from the
position of a father-in-law.

1897
02:10:47,145 --> 02:10:49,392
Your position as a husband
was taken away from you.

1898
02:10:49,638 --> 02:10:51,349
Only one position of
a father was left.

1899
02:10:51,479 --> 02:10:54,161
Just now Neha has snatched
that too.

1900
02:10:54,934 --> 02:10:56,194
Now what is left in your life?

1901
02:10:56,278 --> 02:10:58,977
Hold this bowl and come to beg.
You'll be in profit.

1902
02:10:59,359 --> 02:11:01,198
Fine. Let them trouble me.

1903
02:11:02,310 --> 02:11:04,821
Today they're more powerful.

1904
02:11:05,630 --> 02:11:12,237
The day my son will be released
from prison, I'll become powerful.

1905
02:11:33,851 --> 02:11:35,121
Vikram!

1906
02:11:35,927 --> 02:11:37,516
My ace man!

1907
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:40,490
My darling! The apple of my eyes!

1908
02:11:40,573 --> 02:11:43,944
And I don't know what else.
Come and hug me, son.

1909
02:11:44,820 --> 02:11:47,364
You went to prison
on the charge of rape.

1910
02:11:47,619 --> 02:11:50,200
But here, my life was ruined.

1911
02:11:50,561 --> 02:11:54,531
Now that you've returned,
think of some evil plan.

1912
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:58,459
Please throw that idiot Shankar
out and put me inside the house.

1913
02:12:00,294 --> 02:12:03,703
At least answer me.
What are you thinking?

1914
02:12:03,964 --> 02:12:06,717
- I'm not thinking, but
blaming my destiny. - Why?

1915
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:09,666
Because I was born to a
sinner father like you.

1916
02:12:10,357 --> 02:12:13,711
I wish I had born in the house of
a noble person like Mr. Shankar.

1917
02:12:14,935 --> 02:12:17,616
Maybe he would've not
given me enough to eat,

1918
02:12:18,062 --> 02:12:19,855
but at least he would've
been taught me to live...

1919
02:12:19,938 --> 02:12:21,129
...with decency and honesty.

1920
02:12:21,356 --> 02:12:23,025
At least my great brother-in-law...

1921
02:12:23,108 --> 02:12:24,985
...wouldn't have been embarrassed
because of me.

1922
02:12:25,194 --> 02:12:28,072
At least I would've done
social service along with him.

1923
02:12:28,238 --> 02:12:30,407
Are you the same Vikram
or his duplicate?

1924
02:12:30,616 --> 02:12:32,993
You don't seem to be my son.
You've completely changed.

1925
02:12:33,077 --> 02:12:34,244
Yes. I've changed.

1926
02:12:34,620 --> 02:12:38,874
And I'll prove it to my mother and
brother-in-law through hard work.

1927
02:12:38,957 --> 02:12:41,585
- I'll definitely prove it.
- Nobody will trust you.

1928
02:12:41,919 --> 02:12:46,423
Nobody will trust a person
who has erred...

1929
02:12:46,507 --> 02:12:48,175
...many times in the past. Got it.

1930
02:12:48,258 --> 02:12:50,386
If I'll not be able
to gain their trust,

1931
02:12:50,754 --> 02:12:52,870
I'll commit suicide.

1932
02:12:53,138 --> 02:12:54,332
Live long, son!

1933
02:12:55,474 --> 02:12:57,643
The human, who realises
his mistake...

1934
02:12:58,268 --> 02:13:00,225
...is even forgiven by god.

1935
02:13:00,308 --> 02:13:01,540
- Father!
- Enough!

1936
02:13:02,856 --> 02:13:04,690
You're a great man, father!

1937
02:13:05,317 --> 02:13:08,529
You've settled the wrecked
life of my sister again.

1938
02:13:09,530 --> 02:13:14,131
You've done the work that my
sinner father should've done.

1939
02:13:15,369 --> 02:13:18,099
I was a very bad human
being, father.

1940
02:13:18,778 --> 02:13:21,295
But I've completely reformed now.

1941
02:13:22,209 --> 02:13:23,403
But I know...

1942
02:13:24,548 --> 02:13:27,589
...that my brother-in-law
and mother won't trust me.

1943
02:13:28,382 --> 02:13:31,314
- They won't forgive me.
- What are you saying?

1944
02:13:33,011 --> 02:13:35,305
- Brother. - Brother!
- You're wrong.

1945
02:13:35,663 --> 02:13:37,599
We wanted you to reform.

1946
02:13:37,808 --> 02:13:40,018
Even your brother-in-law
wanted the same thing.

1947
02:13:40,902 --> 02:13:42,069
Son Ravi.

1948
02:13:42,771 --> 02:13:46,218
...forget about the past
and forgive Vikram.

1949
02:13:46,984 --> 02:13:48,111
No, father.

1950
02:13:49,120 --> 02:13:54,096
I've troubled brother-in-law
so much he'll never forgive me.

1951
02:13:56,160 --> 02:13:57,303
Vikram!

1952
02:13:58,921 --> 02:14:01,874
Let's go home.
- May everyone be ruined!

1953
02:14:04,996 --> 02:14:06,162
Come.

1954
02:14:09,882 --> 02:14:11,036
Mother!

1955
02:14:11,969 --> 02:14:13,391
Here comes this idiot!

1956
02:14:13,693 --> 02:14:15,015
Shame!

1957
02:14:15,255 --> 02:14:17,146
Master, shame on you.

1958
02:14:17,681 --> 02:14:19,504
Today you've been thrown
from one more position.

1959
02:14:19,769 --> 02:14:21,393
First your son-in-law removed you.

1960
02:14:21,560 --> 02:14:22,895
Then your daughter rejected you.

1961
02:14:22,978 --> 02:14:24,229
Your wife disowned you.

1962
02:14:24,439 --> 02:14:27,733
Only one son was left.
And even he came and spurned you.

1963
02:14:28,192 --> 02:14:31,195
I think it's better for you
if you commit suicide in shame.

1964
02:14:36,946 --> 02:14:38,619
C'mon, brothers. Have food.

1965
02:14:38,858 --> 02:14:41,919
But uncle, Dhaniya has still
not brought your food.

1966
02:14:42,002 --> 02:14:44,222
- I'll eat your food. C'mon.
- Fine.

1967
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:47,562
- Listen, brother.
- Yes, brother.

1968
02:14:47,645 --> 02:14:49,543
- Whom do you want to meet?
- Mr. Ravi.

1969
02:14:49,792 --> 02:14:51,535
Mr. Ravi has gone to the city.
Any important work?

1970
02:14:51,618 --> 02:14:54,079
- Yes. We've come
from sugar factory. - Ok.

1971
02:14:54,162 --> 02:14:57,264
I had to give Rs.50,000 advance to
him for the purchase of sugarcane.

1972
02:14:58,053 --> 02:14:59,668
Give it to me. I'll give it to him.

1973
02:14:59,751 --> 02:15:01,128
What? To you?

1974
02:15:01,211 --> 02:15:04,190
- Yes. I'm his father-in-law.
- Really?

1975
02:15:04,548 --> 02:15:06,383
- You're his father-in-law?
- Yes.

1976
02:15:06,718 --> 02:15:08,016
Do you've any doubt?

1977
02:15:08,456 --> 02:15:14,349
Mr. Juman, I think that
this insane is some fraud.

1978
02:15:14,433 --> 02:15:15,726
- Greetings, madam.
- Greetings!

1979
02:15:15,809 --> 02:15:17,427
- Greetings!
- Greetings!

1980
02:15:17,603 --> 02:15:21,021
I came to give money to Mr. Ravi.

1981
02:15:21,519 --> 02:15:23,400
Give this money to father.

1982
02:15:23,483 --> 02:15:25,652
He's Mr. Ravi's father-in-law
and my father.

1983
02:15:26,237 --> 02:15:29,072
I apologise. I'll never
repeat this mistake again.

1984
02:15:29,156 --> 02:15:31,304
Now do you believe I'm
Mr. Ravi's father-in-law?

1985
02:15:31,491 --> 02:15:33,327
- Yes. - Fine.
Take this. - Fine.

1986
02:15:33,410 --> 02:15:35,467
- Greetings!
- Thank you. Greetings!

1987
02:15:36,090 --> 02:15:38,457
These people are very strange! They
judge people from their clothes.

1988
02:15:38,673 --> 02:15:41,335
Father, even you're
in an odd state.

1989
02:15:41,418 --> 02:15:43,712
- You've worn such dirty clothes.
- So what?

1990
02:15:44,364 --> 02:15:46,298
You shouldn't judge a
man from his clothes.

1991
02:15:46,381 --> 02:15:48,425
His soul doesn't become evil
if he's wearing dirty clothes.

1992
02:15:48,508 --> 02:15:50,469
Ok. Have food.

1993
02:15:50,552 --> 02:15:52,467
Why did you bring the food?
Where is Dhaniya?

1994
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:54,973
Today I'll feed you with my hands.

1995
02:15:55,057 --> 02:15:57,225
Freshen up. I'll serve food.

1996
02:15:57,478 --> 02:15:59,645
Ok. Keep this money
safely in the cupboard.

1997
02:15:59,728 --> 02:16:01,161
I'll freshen up.

1998
02:16:10,137 --> 02:16:11,317
Father.

1999
02:16:14,409 --> 02:16:15,535
This money?

2000
02:16:15,619 --> 02:16:18,538
Father,
Neha gave me 50,000 rupees...

2001
02:16:18,758 --> 02:16:20,874
...so that I can start
my own business.

2002
02:16:21,203 --> 02:16:24,628
And she told me not to say anything
about this money to anybody.

2003
02:16:25,035 --> 02:16:27,183
But father,
I'm feeling very scared.

2004
02:16:28,010 --> 02:16:30,092
If my brother-in-law
finds this out...

2005
02:16:30,516 --> 02:16:33,303
...my sister's settled
life would be ruined.

2006
02:16:34,059 --> 02:16:35,910
Father, please keep
this money with you.

2007
02:16:36,035 --> 02:16:37,187
No, son.

2008
02:16:37,732 --> 02:16:39,891
It's not wrong for a
sister to help a brother...

2009
02:16:40,382 --> 02:16:42,877
...who has left the wrong path...

2010
02:16:43,325 --> 02:16:45,942
...and who wants to earn
his living with honesty.

2011
02:16:46,608 --> 02:16:49,905
Keep this money and you
start a good business with this.

2012
02:16:50,392 --> 02:16:51,947
As you wish, father.

2013
02:16:52,523 --> 02:16:55,855
Please bless me so that
I can start a new business.

2014
02:16:56,523 --> 02:16:57,995
May god make you successful!

2015
02:16:58,515 --> 02:17:01,043
And father, I've one more request.

2016
02:17:01,529 --> 02:17:03,667
Till don't get success in my work...

2017
02:17:03,988 --> 02:17:06,128
...please don't tell anyone
about this money.

2018
02:17:06,211 --> 02:17:08,628
- Ok. I won't.
- Swear upon me.

2019
02:17:08,799 --> 02:17:11,047
Ok. I do. I'll not tell.

2020
02:17:11,261 --> 02:17:12,821
- Go.
- Yes, father.

2021
02:17:14,688 --> 02:17:16,776
- Daughter Neha.
- Yes, father.

2022
02:17:18,031 --> 02:17:20,434
If son-in-law comes, tell him
that the watchman is on a leave.

2023
02:17:20,517 --> 02:17:22,417
So I'm going to the guard the farm.

2024
02:17:22,500 --> 02:17:24,608
- Ok, father. I'll tell him.
- Ok.

2025
02:17:25,494 --> 02:17:28,801
"The stream meets the river."

2026
02:17:31,669 --> 02:17:35,771
'This is a good opportunity
to kill Shankar.'

2027
02:17:38,143 --> 02:17:39,749
It's so dark!

2028
02:17:43,391 --> 02:17:46,126
Take care, master. It's night now.

2029
02:17:46,209 --> 02:17:48,465
Snakes and scorpions come out

2204
02:30:35,182 --> 02:30:37,588
He has just returned from
the hospital. Go, come later.

2205
02:30:37,791 --> 02:30:41,367
- Son, rest inside. - Mr. Shankar,
I badly need money now.

2206
02:30:41,592 --> 02:30:44,062
So please return me
the advance money.

2207
02:30:45,186 --> 02:30:48,705
Father, return his money to him.

2208
02:30:49,767 --> 02:30:51,933
- How much money is it?
- 50,000 rupees.

2209
02:30:53,525 --> 02:30:55,523
Father, why are you standing?

2210
02:30:56,060 --> 02:30:57,233
Please go.

2211
02:30:57,361 --> 02:31:00,618
Son, actually, that money is...

2212
02:31:01,843 --> 02:31:03,691
Have you spent it for some purpose?

2213
02:31:03,864 --> 02:31:06,531
No, child. How can I spend
it without informing you?

2214
02:31:07,427 --> 02:31:09,041
Then bring it.

2215
02:31:12,074 --> 02:31:13,873
Neha, you bring it.

2216
02:31:27,441 --> 02:31:29,895
It isn't there? Then where is it?

2217
02:31:31,698 --> 02:31:34,362
Brother-in-law, please ask him...

2218
02:31:34,701 --> 02:31:38,553
How did he get 50,000 rupees
to buy the farm in the village.

2219
02:31:38,637 --> 02:31:41,204
Vikram is lying, son-in-law.
I've not bought any farm.

2220
02:31:41,381 --> 02:31:44,743
What are you saying, Mr. Shankar?
Are you losing your memory?

2221
02:31:44,904 --> 02:31:48,194
You've bought a farm.
And brother-in-law is its witness.

2222
02:31:48,514 --> 02:31:49,749
Son Ravi, this is false.

2223
02:31:50,035 --> 02:31:53,498
I had given his advance money
to Neha to keep in the cupboard.

2224
02:31:54,130 --> 02:31:56,859
Then he came to me one day
with 50,000 rupees and said...

2225
02:31:57,245 --> 02:31:59,443
Neha has given him
that 50,000 rupees...

2226
02:31:59,566 --> 02:32:02,246
...to become self independent
and start a new life.

2227
02:32:02,743 --> 02:32:04,773
I didn't give any
money to brother Vikram.

2228
02:32:07,386 --> 02:32:10,094
Daughter, didn't you
give him 50,000 rupees?

2229
02:32:10,470 --> 02:32:11,618
No, father.

2230
02:32:12,335 --> 02:32:14,724
But he told me that
you've given it.

2231
02:32:15,135 --> 02:32:17,200
And he told me not to say
anything about it to anyone.

2232
02:32:17,403 --> 02:32:19,949
So I promised him not to do so.

2233
02:32:21,533 --> 02:32:25,513
He's definitely lying,
brother-in-law. He's accusing me.

2234
02:32:25,902 --> 02:32:30,059
He's taking advantage of my past
life and trying to prove me culprit.

2235
02:32:30,465 --> 02:32:32,310
But you know the truth.

2236
02:32:32,394 --> 02:32:35,272
You've the receipt of the
land that he has bought, right?

2237
02:32:35,488 --> 02:32:37,108
This is absolutely false, son Ravi.

2238
02:32:37,304 --> 02:32:41,697
Now you'll even say that you've
neither betrayed nor cheated me.

2239
02:32:46,534 --> 02:32:47,738
Sir...

2240
02:32:48,953 --> 02:32:53,211
I've come to you today for justice.

2241
02:32:54,647 --> 02:32:56,260
This respected man...

2242
02:32:56,748 --> 02:33:02,833
...lured me with a land
worth 50,000 rupees.

2243
02:33:04,385 --> 02:33:09,542
And in return he kept on
molesting me like a beast.

2244
02:33:12,592 --> 02:33:16,661
When I was pregnant
with his child...

2245
02:33:18,108 --> 02:33:22,528
I begged him to marry me...

2246
02:33:23,696 --> 02:33:24,890
...or else...

2247
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:27,596
I'll be disgraced in this world.

2248
02:33:29,868 --> 02:33:35,261
He told me to abort this child.

2249
02:33:36,682 --> 02:33:41,211
And he gave me this ring
to bear all the expenses.

2250
02:33:44,467 --> 02:33:46,561
- 'Accept this small gift.
- No, child.'

2251
02:33:48,522 --> 02:33:49,723
'Please don't refuse.'

2252
02:34:00,770 --> 02:34:03,244
I swear on my dead daughter Chanda.

2253
02:34:03,959 --> 02:34:06,622
I really don't know
what she is saying.

2254
02:34:08,199 --> 02:34:09,489
- Shut up!
- Look!

2255
02:34:09,863 --> 02:34:11,243
Even I think...

2256
02:34:11,643 --> 02:34:13,595
My father and brother had planned
this...

2257
02:34:13,925 --> 02:34:15,998
...to throw him out of this house.

2258
02:34:16,290 --> 02:34:17,460
Son Ravi...

2259
02:34:18,694 --> 02:34:20,836
I don't know anything
about 50,000 rupees.

2260
02:34:21,431 --> 02:34:26,130
But I saw him giving this ring
to Pushpa in our backyard.

2261
02:34:30,860 --> 02:34:33,419
Son Ravi, it's true that
I had given this ring to her.

2262
02:34:34,048 --> 02:34:35,104
But there...

2263
02:34:35,187 --> 02:34:36,465
- Son Ravi.
- Brother-in-law.

2264
02:34:36,895 --> 02:34:39,146
Ravi - Did you see his
condition because of you?

2265
02:34:39,230 --> 02:34:40,982
- Vikram, take him inside.
- Son Ravi!

2266
02:34:41,065 --> 02:34:43,651
- C'mon, brother-in-law.
- Wait. I'll tell you the truth.

2267
02:34:43,734 --> 02:34:46,654
- Listen to me. - You old fool,
where are you going?

2268
02:34:46,737 --> 02:34:48,030
- Son Ravi.
- Get lost.

2269
02:34:48,114 --> 02:34:49,650
Son Ravi, listen to me.

2270
02:34:50,259 --> 02:34:53,323
I'll tell you everything.
Son Ravi, wait. - Get lost!

2271
02:34:53,406 --> 02:34:55,147
- Son Ravi, listen to me.
- Get out.

2272
02:34:55,384 --> 02:34:57,682
- I've not done anything.
- Father.

2273
02:34:57,765 --> 02:34:59,000
- Son Ravi, wait.
- Out.

2274
02:34:59,083 --> 02:35:00,349
- Father!
- Son Ravi, wait.

2275
02:35:01,597 --> 02:35:04,380
- I'm wrongly accused. Listen.
- Father!

2276
02:35:04,463 --> 02:35:05,965
- Wait.
- Leave me!

2277
02:35:06,048 --> 02:35:08,301
- Let go of me.
- I've not done anything.

2278
02:35:08,384 --> 02:35:11,433
- Wait. Listen to me. This is wrong.
- Father!

2279
02:35:13,909 --> 02:35:16,475
- Neha, come here.
- Father!

2280
02:35:16,559 --> 02:35:18,546
Who is your father? This swine?

2281
02:35:18,630 --> 02:35:21,257
I'm your mother's husband.
Then how come he's your father?

2282
02:35:21,341 --> 02:35:23,384
- Get inside.
- And listen to me, old man.

2283
02:35:23,509 --> 02:35:26,262
Forget this house, if I ever
see you even in this village,

2284
02:35:26,346 --> 02:35:28,543
I'll kill you. Get it?
Get lost now.

2285
02:35:28,953 --> 02:35:30,234

"Selfishness makes
human stoop so low."

2287
02:35:36,252 --> 02:35:41,361
"It takes a new form
at every stage."

02:35:41,444 --> 02:35:47,033
"Our kin are worse
than strangers here."

"People are greedy for money here."

"People are greedy for money here."

"Fake pride and
display exist here."

"People betray themselves."

"Such people live here."

"Our life makes us
face difficult stages."

After returning from the jail,
the way you had changed...

2296
02:36:36,228 --> 02:36:38,001
...and entered into Ravi's house...

2297
02:36:38,084 --> 02:36:40,160
...it had given the biggest
shock of my life.

[LAUGHING]

2299
02:36:41,906 --> 02:36:44,382
But you've given
my position back to me...

2300
02:36:44,465 --> 02:36:46,759
...by removing that Shankar
from this house today.

2301
02:36:47,175 --> 02:36:50,346
And you've proved that a son
is always better than a father.

2302
02:36:50,430 --> 02:36:53,507
I've done all this
for you only, father.

2303
02:36:53,839 --> 02:36:58,042
I couldn't bear to see stranger
reigning in my father's place...

2304
02:36:58,405 --> 02:37:02,270
...and my father roaming in
the lanes like a mad dog.

2305
02:37:02,893 --> 02:37:07,109
Father, now your old age
will surely pass in peace.

2306
02:37:07,732 --> 02:37:10,142
And my sister and mother will rule.

2307
02:37:10,862 --> 02:37:13,622
But what do I do about that Pushpa?

2308
02:37:14,024 --> 02:37:15,701
You handle her.

2309
02:37:16,415 --> 02:37:19,769
I'll ruin that Shankar.

[LAUGHING]

2311
02:37:25,924 --> 02:37:29,640
That scum Ravi had
imprisoned me for 5 years.

And today, I've looted his
entire money and jewellery.

Shankar, have you seen
such a mean brother...

02:37:41,281 --> 02:37:45,439
...who is stealing wealth from
his own real sister's safe?

Friends, enjoy tonight.

Because tomorrow morning we'll
leave for city with his wealth.

2320
02:37:54,801 --> 02:37:57,362
But master, what will
we do to this Shankar?

2321
02:37:58,201 --> 02:38:02,247
We'll make him drink poison.

2322
02:38:02,609 --> 02:38:06,293
So that the people will think he
committed suicide out of shame.

2323
02:38:07,211 --> 02:38:10,410
Vikram, give 5,000 rupees
to her and shut her mouth.

2324

Who are you?

Have you forgotten
about your evilness?

You've always lived
on other's money.

In spite of a wife, you've
an affair with this Pushpa.

Who will call a bastard
like you a father?

2338
02:38:52,801 --> 02:38:57,728
Even in prison I had written bastard
in the place of father's name.

Did you see Chaurangi Lal...

How the greed for wealth makes
you forget human relationships?

Today your son has
become your enemy.

02:39:08,577 --> 02:39:12,017
You still have time to stop him.

2343
02:39:12,476 --> 02:39:16,244
And repent for all your sins,
Chaurangi Lal.

2344
02:39:20,301 --> 02:39:21,435
I'll do it.

2345

slap taught me the lesson...

learned in my whole life.

all my sins today.

02:39:43,982 --> 02:39:46,599

- How?
- Yes.

But after staying for 5 years
in the jail...

more than you have.

the plan of both father and son.

2370
02:40:54,027 --> 02:40:58,939
I just wanted to see how
low you can stop for money.

2371
02:41:00,872 --> 02:41:04,060
For money I've already hit
my old father.

2372
02:41:04,888 --> 02:41:07,276
Now a young man will
face a young man.

2373
02:41:22,540 --> 02:41:23,763
Son Ravi!

2374
02:41:52,711 --> 02:41:55,159
- No. Leave this bag.
- Get lost!

2375
02:43:34,472 --> 02:43:35,733
Son Ravi!

2376
02:43:36,150 --> 02:43:37,943
Forgive me, father.

2377
02:43:38,846 --> 02:43:42,448
My fraud relatives accused
you of evil deeds.

2378
02:43:44,743 --> 02:43:48,851
God glitters only after
it's burnt in flame.

2379
02:43:49,679 --> 02:43:52,906
Similarly we've to suffer
pain in order to show our...

2380
02:43:53,222 --> 02:43:55,157
...true qualities to the world.

2381
02:43:55,950 --> 02:43:57,126
Son!

2382
02:43:57,369 --> 02:43:59,790
Ravi!

2383
02:44:13,725 --> 02:44:14,948
Vikram!

2384
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:27,487
Vikram!

2385
02:44:29,725 --> 02:44:31,128
Vikram!

2386
02:44:32,941 --> 02:44:35,449
What did you, Chaurangi?

2387
02:44:43,922 --> 02:44:47,307
I had raised this evil boy.

2388
02:44:48,066 --> 02:44:51,261
And I've repented for
my sins by killing him.

2389
02:44:53,343 --> 02:44:55,137
I was a selfish man...

2390
02:44:56,021 --> 02:45:00,213
Who lived for himself and
not for his wife or daughter.

2391
02:45:03,788 --> 02:45:05,843
And I'm such a sinner...

2392
02:45:06,588 --> 02:45:09,860
Who destroyed the house
where I lived.

2393
02:45:12,917 --> 02:45:14,423
So generous people...

2394
02:45:15,925 --> 02:45:18,276
...like you are
needed in this house.

2395
02:45:48,553 --> 02:45:49,772
Bhiku...

2396
02:45:51,104 --> 02:45:52,765
Bhiku, my friend.

2397
02:45:53,302 --> 02:45:55,240
I've met you at the right time.

2398
02:45:57,139 --> 02:46:01,176
You always used to taunt
me and make me understand.

2399
02:46:02,126 --> 02:46:05,256
But I never tried to understand.

2400
02:46:06,164 --> 02:46:08,728
You always used to say the truth.

2401
02:46:09,535 --> 02:46:11,809
You're not a beggar, but an angel.

2402
02:46:12,454 --> 02:46:16,524
- And I'm the beggar
of beggars, Bhiku. - No, master.

2403
02:46:17,959 --> 02:46:21,058
Everybody is a
beggar in this world.

2404
02:46:24,049 --> 02:46:27,610
We chase food when we are hungry.
So we're beggars for food.

2405
02:46:28,635 --> 02:46:32,429
These greedy people
who love wealth chase it.

2406
02:46:32,513 --> 02:46:34,005
So they're beggars of wealth.

2407
02:46:34,710 --> 02:46:35,933
These immoral people...

2408
02:46:36,016 --> 02:46:38,421
Are greed for lust.
Because they're beggar for lust.

2409
02:46:38,829 --> 02:46:42,296
These leaders try to get votes
because they're beggar of votes.

2410
02:46:43,579 --> 02:46:48,152
Master, If you think
deeply you'll realize...

2411
02:46:48,792 --> 02:46:50,796
...every human runs after
something all the time.

2412
02:46:50,879 --> 02:46:53,367
Every human is a beggar
for one thing or another.

2413
02:46:54,169 --> 02:46:57,600
But the only difference
is that some lucky beggars...

2414
02:46:57,947 --> 02:47:03,274
Get all good virtues.
And some unlucky beggars get vices.

2415
02:47:03,357 --> 02:47:08,391
Wow, Bhiku!
You're absolutely right.

2416
02:47:09,861 --> 02:47:12,804
But for a cunning beggar like me...

2417
02:47:12,888 --> 02:47:18,261
...even death penalty isn't enough.

2418
02:47:19,294 --> 02:47:22,186
You've spoken like a king.

2419
02:47:22,921 --> 02:47:26,766
Like my king. I'm the
minister of this king.

2420
02:47:27,863 --> 02:47:33,049
This minister will wait and beg
outside the prison for his king.

2421
02:47:34,662 --> 02:47:36,212
You'll return. Right, master?

2422
02:47:36,526 --> 02:47:38,354
- Bhiku!
- For me!

2423
02:47:39,885 --> 02:47:42,698
Return for my sake, master.

2424
02:47:45,143 --> 02:47:46,379
Let's go.
