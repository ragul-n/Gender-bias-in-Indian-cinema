1
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:17,500
Today, there are so many
flowers that have bloomed.

2
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:22,125
Everyday, she looks at
the empty room in the morning.

3
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,208
She feels...

4
00:01:25,292 --> 00:01:29,958
...that you are angry with her and hence,
you have left.

5
00:01:31,208 --> 00:01:34,875
That is why today it seems
more flowers have bloomed.

6
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:48,792
"Right in the midst
of the garden of flowers."

7
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:55,000
"God knows what he said and meant."

8
00:01:55,458 --> 00:02:01,250
"The fragrance of flowers seem lost now."

9
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:07,542
"It seems that it is gone with him."

10
00:02:07,875 --> 00:02:13,750
"In my heart, there is a restlessness."

11
00:02:14,042 --> 00:02:23,000
"My eyes seem to be closing on their own."

12
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:31,292
"Where did he go? Which path did he take?"

13
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:35,708
"It seems to have taken my life."

14
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:41,208
"Who is it it that has gone?"

15
00:02:58,917 --> 00:03:00,500
Very nice.

16
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,958
- Hey, are you very busy?
- Let me see.

17
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:05,208
We have to arrange the props.

18
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:08,333
Megh. In the last show,
I didn't get two necklaces.

19
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,625
- Just take a look. Just find out.
- I will be right there.

20
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:13,333
- Okay, okay.
- It is fine. Fine.

21
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,083
Just make it quick.

22
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,792
You have not come here to shoot photos.

23
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,250
- I am here. I am here.
- Hey, watch out. Watch out. Come on.

24
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:57,542
- Here he is.
- What are the sweets for?

25
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,500
You put up such a nice and sweet show.
Cannot I give some sweets in return?

26
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:06,625
- Show was great! Wow.
- What is it?

27
00:04:06,708 --> 00:04:07,417
Sweets!

28
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,625
So what if there are sweets? Hey.

29
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:10,583
Hey.

30
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,458
Thank you.
You have sugar. You won't have it.

31
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,000
Icche will get fat if she has it.

32
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,958
- Hence, I will have it.
- Hey.

33
00:04:16,042 --> 00:04:18,125
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Oh, no.

34
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,833
Kadambari. My darling.

35
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:27,875
Don't make her proud like this.

36
00:04:28,625 --> 00:04:31,667
You didn't play the role
of Kadambari well today.

37
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,083
How can you play it well if you
remain on your mobile before the show?

38
00:04:38,042 --> 00:04:39,667
Brother, I will have it later.

39
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:44,958
Where are the earrings?

40
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,000
It was in the box. I cannot find it now.

41
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:47,750
- This isn't good.
- Hey.

42
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:50,167
- Find out.
- I lost a necklace even in the last show.

43
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:50,542
What happened?

44
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,542
- What happened?
- Look. I lost a necklace.

45
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,833
- Now I cannot find the earrings too.
- It might be there. Come on.

46
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:59,625
I just couldn't find
the one who has written this.

47
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,542
Oh, wow. What language!

48
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,125
What pain. Our brother Neel.

49
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:09,625
Let it be, brother.

50
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:32,625
"Judge, the one who will judge
you has woken up today. Public."

51
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:37,458
"All of your deeds which are right..."

52
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:41,958
"...and wrong will be judged
thoroughly by the public."

53
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:49,542
"Judge, the one who will judge
you has woken up today. Public.""

54
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:15,042
Have you eaten something?

55
00:06:16,417 --> 00:06:18,000
Icchemoti.

56
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:24,000
It is very late.
Let me know. I will eat then.

57
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,792
"The ones who didn't get
justice will get justice now."

58
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:42,542
"The ones who didn't get
justice will get justice now."

59
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:46,125
"And the ones who were
saved by you will be given..."

60
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:50,708
"...their well deserved
punishment by the public."

61
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,125
In this hot and dry weather,
it seems everything was burning.

62
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,500
There was fear all around.

63
00:06:58,125 --> 00:07:02,500
In times when everything should have been
in order, it seems everything is burning.

64
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,417
In these uncertain times...

65
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:08,917
...I didn't want to lose sight of you.

66
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,417
Who are they?

67
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,667
- Yes, tell me.
- Where are you?

68
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,667
- I am going to the press.
- Had lunch?

69
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,625
No. Not yet.

70
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:28,750
Do you know what the time is?

71
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:31,042
- Have you eaten?
- No.

72
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,417
Have food and let me know.
I will eat after that.

73
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,583
You are too much.

74
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,042
Hey, I am on the road.
I am hanging up.

75
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,917
Hail Lord.

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,208
Hail Lord.

77
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:51,333
Hail Lord.

78
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,083
Make it fast. Make it fast.

79
00:07:55,625 --> 00:08:02,500
Hail Lord Ganesh.
Hail Goddess. Hail Mother Goddess.

80
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,792
Hey, make it fast. Make it fast.

81
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,708
Hail Goddess. Hail Goddess.

82
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,917
Bless me, mother. Mother. Mother.

83
00:08:14,542 --> 00:08:15,958
Be careful.

84
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,167
Cannot you hear me?

85
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,208
Yes? Go and dance.

86
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,417
You will get rich by dancing. Yes.

87
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:31,958
Go. Go and dance with
these foolish people.

88
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:35,083
Show me. Which fool came here...

89
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:38,083
...and gave me money. I have been fooled.

90
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:43,792
Yes. I can save food if you die.

91
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:46,875
Oh, no. Don't ridicule
him for food, Bijan.

92
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,750
Hey, don't talk too much.

93
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:54,000
You don't have anything to do.
We have a lot of work to do.

94
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:58,208
What is it?

95
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,708
Yes. He is too much. Too much.

96
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:10,125
Oh, no. He didn't go to any lowly place.

97
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,000
Why are you getting angry with him, Bijan?

98
00:09:13,083 --> 00:09:17,292
Hey, you don't understand anything.
Keep quiet. Too much.

99
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:21,542
Wouldn't my customers
go to the other shop?

100
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:27,000
This is too much. Right in the morning...

101
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,792
...he left the house
saying he will open the shop.

102
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,000
And then, the fool went to dance.

103
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,917
You moved your hair and smiled just once.

104
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:46,333
My notebooks. And the desktop.

105
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:51,250
My morning, night, consciousness.
Everything seemed overwhelmed.

106
00:09:52,042 --> 00:09:56,000
Didn't Ranjan ask you
not to smile like this?

107
00:10:39,917 --> 00:10:41,417
Neel.

108
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:43,583
Hey, Neel.

109
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,708
Hey. What is it?

110
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,125
Your mobile is switched
off for the last two days.

111
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:03,042
I called Icche.
Even she didn't take my call.

112
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,208
Don't call her anymore.

113
00:11:10,333 --> 00:11:13,083
Will you decide for
me whom to call or not?

114
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,750
Do you know how she addressed me?

115
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:21,500
I have told you so many times, fool.

116
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:23,542
Love isn't for you.

117
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,917
But you are stuck.

118
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,000
Hey.

119
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:33,875
Be a man.

120
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:37,375
Get dressed up and go for an outing.
Everything will be sorted.

121
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:44,458
Hey.

122
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,375
- Here he is.
- Here he is. Look. Look.

123
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:55,458
Who is here?

124
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,792
- Oh my God.
- He is here.

125
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:01,000
How was their dance?

126
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,083
- Tell us.
- Tell us.

127
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:06,792
What amazing dance. What amazing music.

128
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,167
- Oh, wow. Wow.
- What language! What expressions!

129
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,500
- Excellent.
- Wow.

130
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:13,042
I am sure you were looking
at just one person.

131
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,083
Hey. Listen.
What do you understand about dance anyway?

132
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:17,375
- No, no.
- What do you know?

133
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,500
What do you understand
about dancing anyway?

134
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:21,667
None of you know anything about dancing.
Only he understands about dancing.

135
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,250
Yes.

136
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:24,333
- You are a part of dancing group.
- Oh, God.

137
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:29,000
- We are not talented like you, right.
- Yes, yes, he is right.

138
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,083
- Listen.
- Yes.

139
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,958
- You are my Vajra Sen. Right?
- Hey, hey.

140
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:36,375
Leave me.

141
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,000
- Right.
- Hey, hey.

142
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:39,958
- This tide...
- Hey.

143
00:12:40,042 --> 00:12:42,958
- Will take me away with it.
- Hey. What is going on here?

144
00:12:43,042 --> 00:12:44,167
Give me more love.

145
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,917
- Hey, leave me.
- Come on. Come on.

146
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,125
- Come on.
- No, no.

147
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:48,833
So much of emotion.

148
00:12:49,042 --> 00:12:52,125
I will not leave this emotion.
Let me go with the flow...

149
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,458
Oh, God. Leave me.

150
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,417
Keep it low.

151
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,375
- These emotions.
- Quiet. Quiet. Quiet.

152
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:59,083
Quiet. Quiet.

153
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,625
Hey, isn't Arjun here yet?

154
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:03,500
No, brother. He hasn't come yet.

155
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,875
- Sadhan.
- Yes?

156
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,583
- What are you doing there with them?
- Oh, no.

157
00:13:09,667 --> 00:13:10,542
Well, nothing really.

158
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,125
- He is too much.
- Nothing much.

159
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,458
- Do you have any invitation today?
- Why?

160
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,333
You came with something
and hid it all of a sudden.

161
00:13:19,417 --> 00:13:21,708
- You are murmuring there.
- Well, this is a...

162
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:24,708
Gift. I will give it.

163
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:26,750
Tea. Tea.

164
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:28,500
- Hey, he has got tea.
- Tea is here. Tea is here.

165
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:30,375
- Come on. Give me tea.
- He is here.

166
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:32,625
Hey.

167
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:34,125
- Give it.
- Hey, why did you take so long?

168
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,667
No. It is very busy there.

169
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:39,042
Everyone has been asking
for tea time and again.

170
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:43,833
Why not? There was a huge program
the other day. Everyone is very happy.

171
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:45,542
Hey. Give me a tea.

172
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:47,792
- One to me too.
- Look at him.

173
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:48,833
He is too much.

174
00:13:48,917 --> 00:13:50,833
- One needs snacks with tea.
- Give me one.

175
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,625
Hey, do you know your photo
is a big hit on the net.

176
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:55,292
Really?

177
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:59,042
There are so many likes.
In fact, I am really excited about it.

178
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,708
- Really?
- Yes.

179
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:03,750
And not just that,
even fashion magazines and papers...

180
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,500
...have given high value response. Yes.

181
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,958
- I will have snacks.
- Let us go.

182
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:29,167
This city has everything.

183
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,000
Bright shopping malls.

184
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,208
High rise apartments.

185
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:39,833
Expensive restaurants.

186
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:46,208
This city is full of glamour now.

187
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,542
My Icchemoti.

188
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,000
This city has no love.

189
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,250
Lie. Lie. Lie.

190
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:27,583
If you don't come,
who will help this burnt city's roads...

191
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:30,250
...to bloom rhododendron?

192
00:15:33,542 --> 00:15:36,167
Who will, at the end of day
when the light starts to vanish...

193
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:39,375
...use two fingers to write dear Violet?

194
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:46,708
Amidst clouds and with the rise and fall
of the tides, the Earth has become old.

195
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,208
Only you are the same.

196
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:56,375
Like a beauty mark on a
cheek and like a beautiful wave.

197
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,292
Still 19.

198
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,750
Can you understand my condition?

199
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,750
They have fixed my alliance.

200
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:30,667
It is good. What does the boy do?

201
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:34,083
What do you mean?

202
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,625
This is the best news for women.

203
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,958
What else can it be, Sachi?

204
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,125
I wouldn't be able to dance anymore.

205
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,167
What about that?

206
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:53,750
There is nothing to be so sad about.

207
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:57,208
Even after marriage,
there are so many that continue to dance.

208
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,375
My dance will be over.

209
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,458
And...

210
00:17:10,917 --> 00:17:12,500
Without you.

211
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,292
For me, you are everything.

212
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:20,917
Sometimes, the touch of Arjun.

213
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,125
And sometimes, Arneshwar's.

214
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,542
And at times, the passion of Bachar Sen.

215
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,417
That is acting.

216
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:37,542
But while acting, the stage has
shown me the dreams of being settled.

217
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:41,208
Life is not acting, Sachi.

218
00:17:41,292 --> 00:17:43,167
There are many unknown secrets in it.

219
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,250
And there is always space
for novelty and newness.

220
00:17:45,417 --> 00:17:48,625
My dance will get over.
And you are scared to take responsibility?

221
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,708
Don't be emotional.

222
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,583
Srijan.

223
00:17:54,042 --> 00:17:57,208
I respect your love, Sachi.

224
00:17:59,292 --> 00:18:01,250
Wouldn't you feel hurt for me?

225
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:04,500
I will. For losing a talent.

226
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,625
I have mentored you.

227
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:18,208
Come on. Come on.
Come on, guys. Get ready. Get ready.

228
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,708
Shyamoli. Move. Anup, move.

229
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,125
Yes. Ready? Ready? Check.

230
00:18:23,542 --> 00:18:24,875
Make it less. Less.

231
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:27,958
Look at this. This.

232
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,458
Look. Nice, right?

233
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,958
It is ver nice. Let me look.

234
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,833
One more. Hold.

235
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:37,958
Chin down.
Chin down. A little more. Yes. Hold.

236
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,833
You are like a dazzling gazelle.

237
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,917
What is it called in Bengali?
A beautiful deer.

238
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,375
- Your hair. This side.
- Please.

239
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,958
Nice. Chin up. Chin up.

240
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,875
Hold.

241
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,667
My camera is on a roll today.

242
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,833
I just cannot stop clicking.

243
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:25,375
Well, let me look. No, no, Icche.
Not the scarf. This wouldn't work.

244
00:19:25,542 --> 00:19:27,333
Come on. Ready. Come on. Come on. Come on.

245
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,625
Once more. Hold.

246
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:31,375
Hold that.

247
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,083
Well...

248
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,917
I want the photos.

249
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,583
Sure, dear.

250
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,500
You look so beautiful, Icche.

251
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:17,167
Rupam has a good eye.

252
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,500
- Yes, tell me.
- What are you doing?

253
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,083
- Where are you?
- I am going for a rehearsal.

254
00:20:28,333 --> 00:20:32,333
- What rehearsal?
- Your 'Uttaran Mahala' is starting today.

255
00:20:33,625 --> 00:20:36,792
- Have you eaten something?
- No, I am very late.

256
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,792
You will get gas pains if you don't
eat before rehearsals. Have something.

257
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,708
I need to see proof.

258
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:49,750
Tell me.

259
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,083
Don't disconnect the phone.
Don't disconnect the phone at all.

260
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,208
- Meaning?
- I need to hear your breath.

261
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,083
Let me finish my work.

262
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,500
No. I need to hear you breathing.

263
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:05,667
You are a mad girl. Be on line.

264
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,292
Your call.

265
00:21:41,042 --> 00:21:42,667
Neel here.

266
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,083
Icchemoti here.

267
00:21:46,167 --> 00:21:47,708
Tell me.

268
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:50,042
Your anchoring was amazing the other day.

269
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,708
- Thank you.
- And your dance was...

270
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,292
...like the waves of a river.

271
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:02,500
You just wanted to say this much?

272
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,500
It seemed they crashed
into the river banks of my heart.

273
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:08,208
That is too much.

274
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,958
Don't overflow.
The river bank might crash.

275
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,583
In that case, I have to see it.

276
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:19,292
Let me see how weak the river bank is.

277
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:22,000
In this meager house of mine...

278
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,833
...all the doors and windows are open.

279
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:29,708
What if clouds,
rains or moonlight go back?

280
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,208
I have a wish to visit your house one day.

281
00:22:35,292 --> 00:22:36,750
You will really come?

282
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,417
I am hanging up.

283
00:22:48,667 --> 00:22:52,708
Icche. Icche.

284
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:56,750
It seems she is hurting me.

285
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:01,083
It seems she has broken the
shackles of bonds and run away.

286
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:05,250
It seems she is hurting me.

287
00:23:05,333 --> 00:23:09,458
It seems she has broken the
shackles of bonds and run away.

288
00:23:09,542 --> 00:23:13,625
It seems that she is
coming back to get bound.

289
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:17,542
She is coming back. Icche (wish).

290
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,750
Icche(wish).

291
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,833
- Icche.
- Hey, it is my birthday.

292
00:23:23,292 --> 00:23:25,292
- And you didn't even wish me.
- Leave me.

293
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,333
Now handle this.

294
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,083
- Let me see.
- Let go.

295
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:33,042
- What are you doing?
- Hey, hey, hey. No.

296
00:23:33,542 --> 00:23:35,917
- Yes. You must go right now.
- It seems everyone is here.

297
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,875
- No, no, you have to go now.
- Let me see. Let me see.

298
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:42,458
- You must go with me.
- What is it? Birthday boy?

299
00:23:43,417 --> 00:23:44,958
Okay, give us a treat.

300
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:48,750
- Happy birthday.
- Look, all the evil ones are here.

301
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:49,667
I am leaving.

302
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,000
- Hey.
- Tuhin.

303
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,958
- Wait. Wait.
- Where are you going?

304
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:56,083
- He is mad.
- What is this? This is too much.

305
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:58,542
Oh, God.

306
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,667
- She is coming.
- Hail boss.

307
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:02,417
Icche.

308
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:03,917
You are being called.

309
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,375
- Let it be.
- Goon.

310
00:24:05,583 --> 00:24:06,958
Icche.

311
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,208
- I have something to say.
- Yes?

312
00:24:13,292 --> 00:24:14,833
Will you act?

313
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:19,042
- Meaning?
- I mean our...

314
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,417
We have a play. Rakt Karabi.

315
00:24:22,542 --> 00:24:26,000
Everyone says it will be nice
if you play Nandini. Will you do it?

316
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:28,542
- No.
- Icche.

317
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,125
Are you mad?

318
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:38,500
I don't act. Don't bother me about this.

319
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:42,958
Let us go. He is too much.
He does this all the time.

320
00:24:43,458 --> 00:24:44,833
He is a strange man.

321
00:24:44,958 --> 00:24:48,083
What does he think of himself? Too much.

322
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,417
Didn't the girl act in a serial?

323
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:59,708
37 and 14 would be around 51, 52, 53.
Finally 54.

324
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,500
Ten added to 54 is 64 and
another ten added would be 74. Yes.

325
00:25:03,542 --> 00:25:05,458
You will get 26 from me.

326
00:25:05,542 --> 00:25:08,333
No, no. I gave you 20.
You will get 6 rupees.

327
00:25:08,833 --> 00:25:11,750
- What are you saying?
- I swear on Goddess.

328
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:14,875
Everything is clear. I have
given it clearly. See. It is written.

329
00:25:15,042 --> 00:25:18,000
These are papers and written by hand.
What should I do with these? Tell me.

330
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:20,333
So fine. There is no problem.

331
00:25:20,417 --> 00:25:24,500
From the next time, your earrings, safety
pins, head bangles. I mean hair bands.

332
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,500
Everything that you want
from snacks to everything...

333
00:25:26,542 --> 00:25:28,208
...else will be bought
from a shopping mall.

334
00:25:28,292 --> 00:25:31,750
They will get a bill and
I will give it to you. That is it.

335
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,250
It is time for me to go.
I am leaving. Okay?

336
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,833
The girl has a beautiful name. Kanchana.

337
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:39,958
Why do you make it seem
so grumpy when you meet her?

338
00:25:40,125 --> 00:25:41,792
It seems I am in trouble.

339
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:47,042
Are you in a hurry for your train?

340
00:25:47,625 --> 00:25:49,500
Do you think they work according to me?

341
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,375
It is late.

342
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,292
Wouldn't you go home?

343
00:25:57,583 --> 00:25:58,750
Sachi.

344
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,667
It seems all of you
will get peace on getting rid of me.

345
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:04,125
What happened now?

346
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,083
You don't need me anymore in the group.

347
00:26:09,708 --> 00:26:12,083
Is she everything? Main lead.

348
00:26:14,833 --> 00:26:18,458
And I have been dancing for so many years.

349
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,333
Everything is over.

350
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,667
Everything will be fine.

351
00:26:28,917 --> 00:26:30,708
Nothing will be fine.

352
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,500
Nothing will be fine.

353
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,500
Srijan didn't understand either.

354
00:26:39,417 --> 00:26:40,833
Tell me something.

355
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:43,333
Why did he teach me so much?

356
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,792
Why did he ask me
to learn with dedication?

357
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,500
You have a place in the group.

358
00:26:54,583 --> 00:26:57,000
Everything that you say is a farce.
And a lie.

359
00:26:59,833 --> 00:27:02,542
Everything that you say
is something you don't believe in.

360
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,292
You use us to earn fame.

361
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,833
Dolls. We are merely dolls for you.

362
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,250
We are dolls that you play with.

363
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:21,750
- Keep quiet.
- No.

364
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:24,667
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

365
00:27:31,125 --> 00:27:32,542
Look at me.

366
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,542
Look at me.

367
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:38,083
I am into this dance all day.

368
00:27:39,875 --> 00:27:42,750
And yet, dance has left me.

369
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:47,250
I have no colour or rhythm in my life.

370
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,833
I cannot even move properly.

371
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:58,250
Sachi, we have to accept a lot in life.

372
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,042
Srijan.

373
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,542
Go and drop her home.

374
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:11,375
Go.

375
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:58,958
Oh, no. What else shall I see?

376
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:09,542
"Time is gone."

377
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:19,000
"Oh, no, what is this?"

378
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:29,542
"Time is gone."

379
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:43,458
"The vessel containing
the manna is broken."

380
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:50,833
"Death."

381
00:29:51,042 --> 00:30:01,917
"It is time for death."

382
00:30:09,833 --> 00:30:16,083
"You had..."

383
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:22,292
"...lied to me."

384
00:30:47,708 --> 00:30:53,792
"You created lies and made me believe."

385
00:30:54,042 --> 00:31:00,083
"You had said I live without you."

386
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:06,208
"There are showers of rain
dropping on my notebook yet."

387
00:31:06,458 --> 00:31:11,917
"I still have a feeling
of animosity towards you."

388
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:18,333
"But yet, you! You! You! You!"

389
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,667
"You lied to me."

390
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:37,208
"If one moves away, one has to lie."

391
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,500
"I have given my sky to you."

392
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:49,708
"Do birds lie?"

393
00:31:49,917 --> 00:31:55,458
"To live in a golden cage with the king."

394
00:31:55,667 --> 00:32:01,792
"But yet, you! You! You! You!"

395
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:06,417
"You lied to me."

396
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:37,375
"Bring some fire for me."

397
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,500
"If I am alive even after my death."

398
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:55,250
"Even if I die, I would still say this.
Icchemoti. I love you."

399
00:32:55,542 --> 00:33:01,833
"But yet, you! You! You! You!"

400
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:06,542
"You lied to me."

401
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:13,500
The thing is...

402
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,333
...I don't understand that...

403
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:20,125
...on the next 22nd,
it would be the birthday of this group.

404
00:33:21,542 --> 00:33:23,750
And yet, we have not
arranged for anything.

405
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:27,292
Shambhu. Handle the production.

406
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:30,208
I will handle management.

407
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,167
Wow, wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.

408
00:33:35,542 --> 00:33:39,958
Raise as much money as you can.
I will give the rest of the money.

409
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,875
I would like to accept this proposal
with everyone's acceptance.

410
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:43,875
Yes.

411
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:46,583
- Yes. Yes.
- Keep it low. Low. Low.

412
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:49,833
Shambhu.

413
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:52,292
Even I had a dream of
getting into theatre like you.

414
00:33:53,958 --> 00:33:57,167
I feel nice that you have
still kept your dream alive.

415
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,667
Really. Since there are people like you...

416
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,500
...these groups are still working.

417
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,125
- You have started again.
- Again?

418
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:09,292
- Keep quiet.
- Keep it low. Low. Low. What is it?

419
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:13,000
I just wanted to thank him. Nothing else.

420
00:34:13,167 --> 00:34:14,625
There is no point of merely thanking him.

421
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:17,083
You couldn't get Nandini yet.

422
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:20,083
Shambhu. Listen. We don't have time.

423
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:22,667
- You give duties to each one today.
- Yes. Yes.

424
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,958
- Okay. Okay. I will handle this.
- Yes. Yes.

425
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:24,458
Hey.

426
00:34:24,542 --> 00:34:27,375
I wanted to say something about this.
It is a good point.

427
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:30,208
I wanted to say that I am useless.

428
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:33,542
- I mean I don't have duties.
- He speaks rubbish.

429
00:34:33,792 --> 00:34:36,250
I will take the responsibility
of giving duties.

430
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:38,417
In that case, we are done for.

431
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,917
We will have to stage
a play in the colony itself.

432
00:34:43,417 --> 00:34:44,500
Right.

433
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:46,667
What is the point
of talking so much? Tell me.

434
00:34:47,708 --> 00:34:51,542
Okay. Okay. In that case, I...

435
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,708
I swear.

436
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,792
I will get Rajnandini...

437
00:34:56,958 --> 00:35:00,625
...to play Nandini. But...

438
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:04,792
- Yes. But what? Tell us.
- I am telling you. I am telling you.

439
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:06,167
Wait.

440
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:08,125
- Shambhu.
- Yes?

441
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,667
- If Shambhu could make a phone call.
- Look at him.

442
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,542
- What is this?
- Did you hear that? Look.

443
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,333
To Icche. Icche. Icche.

444
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,583
- You are too much. Too much.
- Keep it low. Keep it low. Low.

445
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,292
You are too much.

446
00:36:01,208 --> 00:36:05,417
What is it?
For how long do you want to stay at home?

447
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,125
Yes? Start writing now.

448
00:36:14,125 --> 00:36:15,708
Write my script.

449
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,500
Get up, dear.

450
00:36:21,625 --> 00:36:23,000
Get up.

451
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,125
You are too much.

452
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:28,125
Get up. Get up.

453
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:30,292
Hey.

454
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:32,958
Leave me. I...

455
00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:44,833
Step into the light.

456
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:56,708
Do you want a story of a dance group?

457
00:37:01,125 --> 00:37:03,708
Everyone has got me into trouble.

458
00:37:05,042 --> 00:37:06,500
Even you can get me into trouble.

459
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,792
It is a good story.

460
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:15,000
Regarding a dance group.

461
00:37:16,542 --> 00:37:18,333
No one has made a movie yet.

462
00:37:24,958 --> 00:37:26,667
Give me an interesting story.

463
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,375
I am really done for.

464
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,208
It will be played by someone
and I want it to be within a low budget.

465
00:37:36,792 --> 00:37:38,000
Let me think.

466
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,125
Icche is the only one
in your head right now.

467
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,250
How will you write?

468
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,042
Let me know.

469
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:38,417
Scoundrel. How can you love her so much?

470
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,167
Jump.

471
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:51,458
Jump.

472
00:39:55,208 --> 00:39:56,625
Mass.

473
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,792
Icche. Kick.

474
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:04,167
Stop. Stop.
Stop. Cancel.

475
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,375
- Cancel. Stop.
- Oh, no.

476
00:40:07,167 --> 00:40:09,250
No, no, no.
It isn't working. It is not working.

477
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:12,833
When you go from one stance to another...

478
00:40:13,083 --> 00:40:15,542
...you need to walk in the same manner.
Isn't it?

479
00:40:15,625 --> 00:40:16,542
What is going on?

480
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,250
Do you know something, Sriti?

481
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,792
They just know some expressions.
They don't know anything else.

482
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:26,042
Hey, why are you looking that side?
Isn't Srijan talking?

483
00:40:37,042 --> 00:40:38,458
What is this?

484
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,625
What happened, Sachi?

485
00:40:45,417 --> 00:40:47,333
Come on. Come on.

486
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,500
- What happened?
- Tell me. Tell me.

487
00:40:54,542 --> 00:40:56,458
Hey, what happened? Tell me, dear.

488
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,708
- What is going on?
- Why is she crying?

489
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,667
What is it? What happened? Tell me.

490
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,583
I haven't seen Sachi like this ever.

491
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:06,042
- What happened?
- I don't know.

492
00:41:07,167 --> 00:41:08,667
Tell me.

493
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,542
- I am getting married next month on 14th.
- What?

494
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:14,292
It is good news.

495
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:16,250
- Nobody told us anything.
- Look at her.

496
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:17,500
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

497
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:18,917
- Why didn't you tell us earlier?
- Congratulations.

498
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,583
Sachi, you are too much.

499
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:23,000
No. Everyone is getting married.

500
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:24,917
- When will I get married?
- No.

501
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,417
- Hey, take it. Come on.
- Move.

502
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Take it.

503
00:41:29,542 --> 00:41:31,417
- Hey, move. Move.
- Shall we dance?

504
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,708
Is your husband macho?

505
00:41:33,583 --> 00:41:35,167
- What?
- Get lost.

506
00:41:36,083 --> 00:41:37,875
You didn't tell us anything, Sachi.

507
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,875
You are so secretive.

508
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:42,125
None of you asked me.

509
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,250
If I will ever dance
with all of you or not.

510
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,208
Hey, leave her.

511
00:41:54,958 --> 00:41:56,458
The invitation to my last rites.

512
00:41:59,042 --> 00:42:00,542
All of you must come.

513
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:23,500
I was waiting for you since so long.

514
00:42:23,625 --> 00:42:26,458
Listen, my darling. I was busy and tensed.

515
00:42:27,958 --> 00:42:31,000
Wow. Do you get tensed too?

516
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:34,542
Oh, no. The matter regarding Shathi is
going out of hands now. Fully emotional.

517
00:42:35,542 --> 00:42:38,625
Flower? Where is the flower?

518
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:40,750
- What happened?
- Flower?

519
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,833
Well, flower...

520
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:46,417
Yes. I have got the flower.

521
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,125
Here it is. My darling. How is it?

522
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:52,042
Oh, wow. It is beautiful.

523
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,083
You will look nice. Hence, I got it.

524
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,708
Well, why don't they give you a box?

525
00:42:58,042 --> 00:43:00,917
What is the need of a box?
Hey, there is price written on the box.

526
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,667
Can I give them that chance?
Anyway, wear the ear ring.

527
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,375
Do you want to wear the box?

528
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,167
In fact...

529
00:43:09,167 --> 00:43:11,750
...after this,
I need to book an appointment to meet you.

530
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,625
Everyone is praising you so much. Right?

531
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:17,167
Everyone is saying you look so nice.

532
00:43:17,417 --> 00:43:19,042
You look great.

533
00:43:20,125 --> 00:43:22,667
You are famous.

534
00:43:24,458 --> 00:43:26,083
After this, you will be star, right?

535
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,625
And within a few days,
your photos will be on page 3.

536
00:43:29,792 --> 00:43:31,333
No, no, I am serious. You know?

537
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:33,542
You are getting ad offers.

538
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:39,375
I didn't ask for so much.

539
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:42,583
I just wanted to dance well.

540
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:48,458
Hey, dear. How many people could make
it on page 3 with mere dancing skills?

541
00:43:48,708 --> 00:43:51,500
Of course,
an item dance would be different.

542
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:55,792
Be ready. Be ready. Got it?

543
00:43:55,958 --> 00:43:58,208
You will be tired
of giving out autographs.

544
00:43:58,375 --> 00:44:00,958
Hey, what is wrong with you today?

545
00:44:01,208 --> 00:44:03,583
No. I am predicting the future.

546
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:06,250
- I can see. Right?
- Oh, God.

547
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,208
But yes.

548
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:11,500
I am a little scared too, you know?

549
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,625
You get scared too?

550
00:44:18,042 --> 00:44:21,917
No. After these photos are published in
a magazine, you will become a celebrity.

551
00:44:22,208 --> 00:44:25,000
After that,
big people will start chasing you.

552
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:30,583
I am wondering what will happen
to that old boyfriend of yours.

553
00:44:30,958 --> 00:44:32,667
Shadhan?

554
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:37,917
Can you imagine?
He is so romantic even at this age, right?

555
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:46,917
- Who is it? Take the call.
- Well...

556
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,833
- Hello.
- This is Sabyasachi Sen here.

557
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,792
- Yes, tell me.
- Our group is about to stage Rakt Karini.

558
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:01,208
You are being considered as Nandini.
Will you do it?

559
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,375
Me? Why?

560
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,917
You have the potential.

561
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:14,125
Well, I cannot do it. I cannot act.

562
00:45:15,292 --> 00:45:17,833
Hey, acting is a part of dance.

563
00:45:20,375 --> 00:45:21,875
I am scared.

564
00:45:22,917 --> 00:45:25,875
Have faith in me. Everything will be fine.

565
00:45:25,958 --> 00:45:28,542
You can play the
character of Nandini well.

566
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,125
What is it? Do you agree?

567
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:34,292
I have no faith in myself.

568
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,125
- How can I do it?
- Well, you must agree to this.

569
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:41,042
It will be fine. Don't worry.

570
00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:44,125
You cannot blame me later.

571
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,000
It will be your responsibility.

572
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:48,125
Okay. Okay. Okay. Fine. Fine.

573
00:45:48,208 --> 00:45:50,792
Leave everything to me.

574
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:54,542
Don't worry about it at all.

575
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,625
If you say so.

576
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:04,208
Acting?

577
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:06,417
Not bad. Not bad.

578
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,250
- Keep it quiet.
- Very good.

579
00:46:08,333 --> 00:46:10,083
Cheers to that. Cheers.

580
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:15,417
Neel. He is Swagata.

581
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:18,583
He is my friend.
He is the owner of this station.

582
00:46:18,792 --> 00:46:21,167
Become a jockey here.

583
00:46:22,833 --> 00:46:24,167
Hello.

584
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:28,458
Greetings.

585
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:30,750
Please. Sit down.

586
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:44,125
Your work will be your legacy, lover boy.

587
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:55,500
I have heard a lot about you from Bijay.

588
00:47:03,792 --> 00:47:07,042
I will give you a slot of two hours.

589
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,625
What? Will you do it?

590
00:47:11,708 --> 00:47:14,458
Of course. His ancestors will do it too.

591
00:47:14,792 --> 00:47:17,542
He has a good brain.
But he has a weak heart.

592
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:19,542
- Bijay.
- No, really.

593
00:47:20,167 --> 00:47:22,292
Look. I am telling you from...

594
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:24,708
...the experience I have had.
You can do it.

595
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,167
I have heard everything
about you from Bijay.

596
00:47:28,458 --> 00:47:31,375
I know you will be successful.

597
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,917
I am scared. What if I cannot?

598
00:47:34,375 --> 00:47:36,250
I will turn you into a priest.

599
00:47:36,792 --> 00:47:38,417
Give me some time.

600
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:41,292
I want to know what I am about to do.

601
00:47:42,167 --> 00:47:43,708
You can understand.

602
00:47:46,833 --> 00:47:48,583
I know you can.

603
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:51,125
I will give you two days.

604
00:47:52,167 --> 00:47:54,500
And regarding the
independence of the content...

605
00:47:55,583 --> 00:47:56,875
...it is yours.

606
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,333
If you sleep for two days,
I will make your life hell.

607
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,292
I am telling you.

608
00:48:05,458 --> 00:48:07,958
Your show will be exclusive.

609
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,917
By holding on to me with his two hands...

610
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:17,250
...he made me cross the stormy river.

611
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:18,000
By holding...

612
00:48:18,083 --> 00:48:19,667
By holding onto to the hair of the horse...

613
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:22,917
...he made me cross the forest.

614
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,458
- The jumping tiger...
- The jumping tiger's...

615
00:48:25,625 --> 00:48:27,750
...forehead was shot by an arrow
right in the middle of its eyebrows.

616
00:48:27,917 --> 00:48:30,000
- He did away...
- He did away with my fear...

617
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:32,292
...and laughed loudly.

618
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:36,292
- By jumping into our river...
- By jumping into our river.

619
00:48:36,375 --> 00:48:38,667
He rode on the tides.

620
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:40,208
It seems he played with me...

621
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,167
It seems he played with me in
the same way as he did with the waves.

622
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,458
He seems he pawned his entire life.

623
00:48:44,542 --> 00:48:47,917
He seems he pawned his entire life.

624
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,250
He plays a game of loss and victory.

625
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:52,250
It seems he has won that game...

626
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:55,208
It seems that he has...

627
00:48:56,292 --> 00:48:58,500
...won me in this game.

628
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:02,208
Oh, no. Stop it. Stop it.

629
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,625
I am in love with someone.

630
00:49:05,333 --> 00:49:07,083
A dream?

631
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,333
I got the fragrance of monsoon in her.

632
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:20,375
Did I make a mistake?

633
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:22,500
Wrong or right.

634
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,625
Time will decide about that.

635
00:49:32,542 --> 00:49:33,792
But society?

636
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:36,542
What will society say?

637
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,042
My students?

638
00:49:41,625 --> 00:49:42,958
Don't worry.

639
00:49:44,792 --> 00:49:46,083
Look at Ritu.

640
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,083
I have put up his image
with so much of respect.

641
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:58,375
He is an icon.

642
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,292
His words have a value.

643
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,292
Why don't you have
the courage to speak up?

644
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,542
You don't have faith in whatever you do.

645
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:19,542
Something that is simple and
easy like water and strong like light.

646
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:22,583
Let it happen.

647
00:51:02,583 --> 00:51:04,167
I am writing a script.

648
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:06,708
For Bijay.

649
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:12,083
I feel like talking to you all night.

650
00:51:13,042 --> 00:51:15,083
I don't feel like it, dear.

651
00:51:16,875 --> 00:51:18,417
You are a mean man.

652
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:21,667
This time of the night is for me to study.

653
00:51:22,542 --> 00:51:24,583
Even you have worked hard all day.

654
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,375
Sleep. Or you will feel unwell.

655
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,042
Why? Is it a ghost?

656
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:32,792
Sleep. Or someone will
appear as a ghost...

657
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:33,958
Fool.

658
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:40,708
Wouldn't you give it?

659
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,208
No, I won't. Go. What will you do?

660
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:55,958
My Neel.

661
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,958
From Rabindranath to Salil.
Salil to Suman.

662
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,542
From such icons...

663
00:52:10,167 --> 00:52:11,708
...we still have such iconic songs.

664
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,750
Just like...

665
00:52:14,292 --> 00:52:16,208
...in different conditions of the heart...

666
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:18,250
I mean when you have
nothing to say, then...

667
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:20,083
...there are so many songs and their words.

668
00:52:21,917 --> 00:52:25,125
They fulfill your wishes
and get peace to your heart.

669
00:52:26,292 --> 00:52:29,125
I, in this culture of songs...

670
00:52:30,417 --> 00:52:31,958
...I want to...

671
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:34,208
...experience the intangible
wish of achieving something.

672
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:41,000
I don't have a problem.

673
00:52:41,667 --> 00:52:45,083
Love. Rabidranath Tagore's love.
And his burning.

674
00:52:46,167 --> 00:52:49,125
Salil's love was in pain.
In human being's pain.

675
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,625
Suman's political love. I want you.

676
00:52:53,208 --> 00:52:56,792
This burning.
Human being. Country. This wave.

677
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:01,208
The little experiences of
human beings being lost in these.

678
00:53:02,125 --> 00:53:03,542
The shattered wishes. I...

679
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:05,583
I want to experience these.

680
00:53:06,458 --> 00:53:08,167
Oh, no. These are such heavy words.

681
00:53:08,875 --> 00:53:10,833
I hope the public isn't
unable to understand.

682
00:53:10,917 --> 00:53:13,750
I don't understand about it.
I know about good and bad.

683
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:16,333
Good content and bad content.

684
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:19,292
Bad snacks. Good sweets.

685
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:22,625
Soft porn.
And real cinema. Bad songs. Real songs.

686
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:24,208
What is it? Tell me.

687
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:27,292
I am with you.

688
00:53:29,417 --> 00:53:33,625
At the moment,
I can give you three months.

689
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:35,833
Icchemotir Goppo. (Icchemoti's story).

690
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:39,875
- It will be the name of my show.
- Meaning?

691
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:44,333
Icchemoti is the name of a river.

692
00:53:45,917 --> 00:53:47,583
It has been flowing.

693
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,458
It cannot be seen.
It is an unrevealed identity.

694
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,542
I can hear the waves.

695
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:01,583
Listen. Give me water.

696
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,250
You said there is good news.

697
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:09,542
There is. There is.
But in order to get good news...

698
00:54:09,708 --> 00:54:11,125
...one must give something, right?

699
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,958
So cheap. Disgusting.

700
00:54:16,417 --> 00:54:17,750
I have news.

701
00:54:19,292 --> 00:54:20,417
- What is it?
- Mother has agreed.

702
00:54:23,417 --> 00:54:24,833
- What?
- Yes.

703
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:31,625
Tell me. Tell me.

704
00:54:35,583 --> 00:54:40,500
So keep listening to 92.7 BIG FM.
Nilanjan will sign off now and say bye.

705
00:54:40,542 --> 00:54:44,042
We will meet tomorrow again
at the same time in the same show.

706
00:54:44,417 --> 00:54:46,625
And in the meantime, I have news for you.

707
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:49,000
A new friend is about
to arrive for all of you.

708
00:54:49,083 --> 00:54:50,458
With a story.

709
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:54,792
Welcome him in some time and in the
meantime, listen a good music....

710
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:04,625
- So best of luck, Neel.
- Thank you.

711
00:55:31,708 --> 00:55:35,125
Greetings, I am Neel. On 92.7 Big Fm...

712
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:38,292
...you are listening to Icchemotir Goppo.

713
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,000
Take hold of the oars
of your heart which flutters...

714
00:55:41,083 --> 00:55:42,625
...like a peacock in this world of music.

715
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:47,083
And go along with Icchemoti
river with its sweet sounding tides.

716
00:56:05,917 --> 00:56:07,333
- Bye.
- Bye.

717
00:56:08,208 --> 00:56:09,792
Goodnight.

718
00:56:15,792 --> 00:56:17,750
In this excitement...

719
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:19,625
...Icchemoti will make you float.

720
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,750
You will get lost. And you will lose...

721
00:56:24,458 --> 00:56:27,333
...yourself and yet come back again
in this world of getting or not getting.

722
00:56:27,917 --> 00:56:29,583
In this ancient world.

723
00:56:37,042 --> 00:56:40,583
What is it?
Why did you switch off the radio?

724
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,250
That boys speaks so beautifully.

725
00:56:45,083 --> 00:56:46,875
And plays beautiful songs.

726
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:02,000
"For a lonely girl,
a cloud on the green hills serves..."

727
00:57:02,083 --> 00:57:04,000
"...as inspiration enough for living."

728
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:10,208
"The storm says that
it will make her fly."

729
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,167
"Along with the heart of the lonely girl."

730
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:44,833
"The girl draws beautiful raindrops.
And it starts showering on the painting."

731
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:50,875
"Come, rain.
Come. I will dance happily today."

732
00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:56,042
"Come, rain, come.
I will dance happily today."

733
00:57:56,125 --> 00:58:00,083
"Raindrops."

734
00:58:01,667 --> 00:58:05,708
"It seems like the raindrops
are falling inside my heart..."

735
00:58:05,792 --> 00:58:08,250
"...with a musical accompaniment."

736
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:38,542
My Neel(Blue) mountain.

737
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,333
Hold me firmly.

738
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:44,208
Let me stay right here.

739
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:53,583
My Icchemoti river.

740
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:16,875
"In the heart of this girl,
there are thousands..."

741
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:19,833
"...of birds that have built their nests."

742
00:59:20,292 --> 00:59:25,375
"The wings of the bird
are flying in the sky."

743
00:59:25,625 --> 00:59:30,583
"And with its touch,
there are colours of rainbow everywhere."

744
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:59,375
"That girl is close to me.
You can recognize her."

745
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:03,750
"Maybe on the tunes of rain."

746
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:11,750
"Maybe on the tunes of rain,
she is singing on the hills."

747
01:00:13,375 --> 01:00:18,500
"She is singing on the hills."

748
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:24,208
"Come, rain. Come. I will dance happily."

749
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:29,417
"Come, rain. Come. I will dance happily."

750
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:34,958
"Come, rain. Come I will dance happily."

751
01:00:35,042 --> 01:00:40,208
"Come, rain. Come I will dance happily."

752
01:00:40,292 --> 01:00:45,542
"Come, rain. Come I will dance happily."

753
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:50,583
"Come, rain. Come I will dance happily."

754
01:01:10,167 --> 01:01:12,792
- Hey.
- Hey, look.

755
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:15,042
Hail Lord.

756
01:01:29,592 --> 01:01:31,842
Clean it properly. Clean it.

757
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:34,592
Cannot you see that the customer is here?

758
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:38,133
Don't be lazy.

759
01:01:38,217 --> 01:01:40,300
Finish off the work.

760
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,883
Hey, Madhav.

761
01:01:47,508 --> 01:01:49,800
Give tea to sir.

762
01:01:52,883 --> 01:01:55,050
Is there any news about the girl?

763
01:01:56,883 --> 01:01:58,342
How would I know?

764
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,467
I am not close to her.

765
01:02:09,550 --> 01:02:11,925
Keep the plate. Give me some water.

766
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,717
Yes. You were too
engrossed in that matter.

767
01:02:24,383 --> 01:02:25,675
I was wrong.

768
01:02:26,842 --> 01:02:28,508
I loved her.

769
01:02:30,967 --> 01:02:32,550
She didn't understand the importance.

770
01:02:33,467 --> 01:02:35,092
Icche madam.

771
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,883
She was a lucky customer for me.

772
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,883
She didn't have an account
like the rest of you.

773
01:02:41,175 --> 01:02:42,592
Okay, Bijan.

774
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,800
Don't you understand
anything other than business?

775
01:02:49,092 --> 01:02:51,050
Hey, keep working. Keep working.

776
01:02:52,008 --> 01:02:53,592
Don't waste time.

777
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:03,175
He is too much.

778
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:18,217
Let me see what I can do.

779
01:03:26,175 --> 01:03:27,842
You made tall claims.

780
01:03:28,425 --> 01:03:30,592
You cannot imagine anyone
other than Icchemoti playing Nandini.

781
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:34,675
One cannot do theatre
with someone with less talent.

782
01:03:36,842 --> 01:03:38,550
She can also remain absent
on the day of the show.

783
01:03:44,217 --> 01:03:46,050
Your love was a hindrance to our play.

784
01:03:50,717 --> 01:03:54,050
Shobo. Shobo.
We have to think of an option.

785
01:03:54,217 --> 01:03:57,342
Hey, no, no. There is no...

786
01:03:57,425 --> 01:03:59,425
...need to think of an extreme
step right away.

787
01:03:59,508 --> 01:04:00,550
Keep quiet.

788
01:04:00,633 --> 01:04:02,800
- He is too much.
- He keeps on talking all the time.

789
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:05,592
Are you giving me a certificate? Tell me.

790
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:08,925
Hey, come on. Get up.

791
01:04:09,383 --> 01:04:12,467
Let us make arrangements.
The show must go on.

792
01:04:12,758 --> 01:04:14,842
We cannot remain sitting idle.

793
01:04:15,008 --> 01:04:17,258
We have to prepare the other
characters which are still weak.

794
01:04:17,508 --> 01:04:19,842
That of the teacher and the rest.

795
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:21,717
Listen.

796
01:04:22,842 --> 01:04:24,300
Nandini will come for sure.

797
01:04:25,175 --> 01:04:27,008
Ranjan will wait too.

798
01:04:42,133 --> 01:04:43,467
- Give it to me.
- I won't have it.

799
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,592
- Give it.
- What happened to your sister Icche?

800
01:04:45,675 --> 01:04:46,883
She has disappeared.

801
01:04:47,842 --> 01:04:50,050
Why do you have to gossip about it?
I don't understand.

802
01:04:51,383 --> 01:04:53,758
Hey, cute one. Give it.

803
01:04:54,592 --> 01:04:57,550
Is she with the petty photographer?

804
01:05:01,175 --> 01:05:03,425
None of you know what to say when.

805
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,758
How can we prepare the character of Durga?

806
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,467
There is no time for us to prepare anyone.

807
01:05:19,842 --> 01:05:22,258
Hey, what is the matter with you?

808
01:05:22,342 --> 01:05:24,967
You don't give us tea and roam everywhere.
Where did you go?

809
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:27,508
- Shall I tell them?
- What? Hey, no.

810
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:30,133
Hey, listen. I want to have tea. Listen.

811
01:05:30,967 --> 01:05:31,717
What do you want to say?

812
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,175
- I saw you giving the ear ring.
- Well.

813
01:05:34,258 --> 01:05:35,592
- Who told you?
- Hey.

814
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:37,258
- Hey...
- She will come for sure.

815
01:05:37,342 --> 01:05:39,008
Why are you worried? Give me tea.

816
01:05:39,133 --> 01:05:42,425
Give me tea. Don't worry.
She will come. Don't worry.

817
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,342
Hey, why aren't you taking my call?

818
01:05:48,675 --> 01:05:51,092
You aren't coming to the group.
And not connecting with us either. Oh, no.

819
01:05:51,675 --> 01:05:53,800
This group is a family, Srijan.

820
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,758
Why are you alleging the girl?

821
01:05:57,133 --> 01:05:58,800
Get proper information.

822
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,758
None of you tried
to find out about sister.

823
01:06:08,467 --> 01:06:10,300
Can anyone do Durga without sister?

824
01:06:13,342 --> 01:06:14,967
Durga does away with sad circumstances.

825
01:06:15,883 --> 01:06:17,383
Durga will be possible.

826
01:06:18,175 --> 01:06:19,842
I will find out about sister.

827
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,133
Hey, get up.

828
01:06:24,217 --> 01:06:27,258
We have to finish the rest
of the rehearsal of Durga. Get up.

829
01:06:37,092 --> 01:06:38,717
Switch off the light.

830
01:06:42,758 --> 01:06:45,550
- Switch it off.
- What is it?

831
01:06:46,383 --> 01:06:47,800
Why didn't you turn the light on?

832
01:06:47,842 --> 01:06:49,758
It is so dark.

833
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:53,758
I have a headache.

834
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,800
So have medicine.
You are in pain without a reason.

835
01:06:57,967 --> 01:06:59,342
Hey, go away.

836
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:03,050
I will make a cup of tea.
Will you have it?

837
01:07:03,258 --> 01:07:04,717
Hey, go away.

838
01:07:07,508 --> 01:07:08,883
Your headache will go away.

839
01:08:39,675 --> 01:08:41,050
Here it is.

840
01:08:55,092 --> 01:08:57,050
Let it be.

841
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:01,133
You don't have to arrange your house.

842
01:09:03,217 --> 01:09:05,967
No. Actually I stay alone, right?

843
01:09:06,967 --> 01:09:08,550
You could have told
me you are coming over.

844
01:09:26,092 --> 01:09:27,425
What would you have done?

845
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,383
Would you have kept flowers in your vase?

846
01:09:30,758 --> 01:09:33,133
No, no. Actually I am not...

847
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:35,425
...very well organized.

848
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:37,675
Let me see.

849
01:09:44,717 --> 01:09:46,133
They are my co-inhabitants.

850
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:49,758
I mean they are used to staying this way.

851
01:09:49,842 --> 01:09:52,258
If you move them all of a sudden,
they will be pained.

852
01:10:00,092 --> 01:10:03,133
They will get familiar with me too.
I have to come here eventually.

853
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:05,592
I see.

854
01:10:07,133 --> 01:10:09,050
You are thinking of expanding your empire.

855
01:10:09,633 --> 01:10:10,925
Not at all.

856
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,217
The empire just needs to be cleaned.

857
01:10:14,967 --> 01:10:16,342
Just the way I like it.

858
01:10:25,508 --> 01:10:26,592
Don't lead me on.

859
01:10:28,842 --> 01:10:30,008
I feel scared.

860
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,008
Play it.

861
01:12:07,217 --> 01:12:08,758
I feel like staying over.

862
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:13,842
Will you let me stay?

863
01:12:24,258 --> 01:12:25,592
Ten at night.

864
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,508
Icchemoti. Can you hear me?

865
01:12:29,467 --> 01:12:33,592
92.7 presents Icchemotir Goppo.

866
01:12:33,925 --> 01:12:36,800
Take control of your oars
on your will on this musical tide.

867
01:12:47,217 --> 01:12:48,425
Will you read a poem book?

868
01:12:49,008 --> 01:12:50,467
I will get indigestion.

869
01:13:25,217 --> 01:13:26,800
Rabindranath is my entire life.

870
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:29,300
He has given me a lot of happiness.

871
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,467
Death became familiar.

872
01:13:35,175 --> 01:13:36,342
My mother passed away when I was 13.

873
01:13:37,883 --> 01:13:40,508
At the age of 24, new sister-in-law.

874
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:45,842
My beloved nephew.
Balendra. Wife Mrinalini.

875
01:13:47,175 --> 01:13:50,592
Younger daughter Renuka.
Younger son. 19 years old Somi.

876
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:52,425
Elder daughter Madhavilata.

877
01:13:53,258 --> 01:13:56,758
Well wisher Nitindra and friend Andrews.

878
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:00,800
From that...

879
01:14:01,967 --> 01:14:03,967
...wave of sorrow, he...

880
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:07,467
...walked on the way
to flight of knowledge.

881
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:10,883
I want...

882
01:14:12,842 --> 01:14:15,217
...on the stage, he should be surrounded...

883
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:19,050
...with all the people who
were close to him and his heart.

884
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:23,967
And Rabindranath,
while experiencing that pain...

885
01:14:25,383 --> 01:14:27,050
...goes into a trance while
thinking about creativity.

886
01:14:35,342 --> 01:14:36,633
Wow.

887
01:14:47,467 --> 01:14:50,300
You didn't tell me and told uncle.

888
01:14:51,133 --> 01:14:52,425
Oh, no.

889
01:14:53,842 --> 01:14:55,800
He wants to be close to people.

890
01:15:00,717 --> 01:15:02,508
How much do you know about our group?

891
01:15:02,633 --> 01:15:04,133
I don't have to know them.

892
01:15:05,883 --> 01:15:07,717
They liked the subject of the script.
That is it.

893
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:11,758
Yes. Now everyone should
give him a lot of respect, right?

894
01:15:12,758 --> 01:15:15,717
Hey, what is your problem?
The script or me?

895
01:15:18,050 --> 01:15:19,425
You are so nice.

896
01:15:23,467 --> 01:15:25,883
Tell me. When will you marry me?

897
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:29,050
- What?
- Yes.

898
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:32,717
Before you commit another foolishness,
shouldn't I get hold of you?

899
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:33,883
Hey, wait, wait.

900
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,342
I mean there was no plan as such.

901
01:15:37,717 --> 01:15:39,300
I don't have time.

902
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,050
I feel scared.

903
01:15:49,717 --> 01:15:52,967
You came into my life like a storm.
I hope you don't...

904
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:57,508
No, no, dear.
I will never leave you at any cost.

905
01:16:01,758 --> 01:16:03,217
Hey.

906
01:16:19,258 --> 01:16:21,383
You are my Icchemoti.

907
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:32,508
Have you seen?

908
01:16:33,467 --> 01:16:36,258
It seems the colorful sky
has come down on to the city.

909
01:16:39,133 --> 01:16:41,800
It seems that it has
come from up there for love.

910
01:16:44,008 --> 01:16:46,092
Is that why you have
come down on Earth for me?

911
01:16:47,092 --> 01:16:48,467
To me?

912
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,967
I don't have the divinity to do that.

913
01:16:56,342 --> 01:16:59,217
In your head and here.

914
01:17:00,258 --> 01:17:03,425
You are a mine of diamonds.
Do you know that?

915
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:06,300
You are blinded in love.

916
01:17:10,050 --> 01:17:11,967
Have you not fallen in love?

917
01:17:13,758 --> 01:17:15,175
I fall in love everyday.

918
01:17:19,383 --> 01:17:22,342
When the moon rises in the sky...

919
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,675
...and when there are
strong showers of rain.

920
01:17:27,758 --> 01:17:30,008
When there are birds
sitting on my windows.

921
01:17:31,175 --> 01:17:32,800
And when I watch movies
made by Ritwik Ghatak.

922
01:17:39,592 --> 01:17:41,050
My Neel(Blue)Mountain.

923
01:17:42,592 --> 01:17:44,133
I swear on dance.

924
01:18:16,667 --> 01:18:20,250
This wave of human beings is like a river.

925
01:18:21,375 --> 01:18:23,792
It seems to be flowing
through the crowd of the city.

926
01:18:25,583 --> 01:18:27,250
By mixing around with them...

927
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:29,958
...I feel nice when I experience life.

928
01:19:00,708 --> 01:19:04,208
There are so many emotions, fights,
wishes and battles that are experienced.

929
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:09,375
Family. Children. Dreams.

930
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:11,958
Everything seems to co-exist.

931
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:15,542
At times...

932
01:19:16,667 --> 01:19:18,583
...I feel like talking to everyone.

933
01:19:24,375 --> 01:19:29,750
Neel. You have shown
a lot of human beings to me.

934
01:19:33,792 --> 01:19:35,417
In this battle of life...

935
01:19:36,667 --> 01:19:38,958
...while learning about
the nectar of life...

936
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:41,833
...one's heart gets lit up.

937
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:53,708
Hey.

938
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,875
Hey. Hey.

939
01:19:58,292 --> 01:20:00,042
Hey.

940
01:20:00,917 --> 01:20:03,833
What is it?
Icche seems to have held you up.

941
01:20:04,458 --> 01:20:07,000
Affair? Great. Great.

942
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:11,583
No, no, Sachi.
Uncle tells us about man watching, right?

943
01:20:12,125 --> 01:20:15,208
Expression. Body language. Rhythm reflex.

944
01:20:15,333 --> 01:20:18,000
One needs to do these
if one has to learn. Right?

945
01:20:18,208 --> 01:20:19,917
One needs to be close to Earth.

946
01:20:20,958 --> 01:20:23,667
He doesn't have a problem
with the crowd. So...

947
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:25,500
...we came out.

948
01:20:26,792 --> 01:20:30,000
Do keep a check though.
You mustn't lose your way in this crowd.

949
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,208
I feel very scared.

950
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,500
You can have faith. You wouldn't get lost.

951
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:37,750
She will reach the right place.

952
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:43,042
You are right. One doesn't get the chance
to understand right or wrong these days.

953
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:45,917
- Come on.
- Let us go.

954
01:20:50,083 --> 01:20:51,583
We are leaving.

955
01:20:57,667 --> 01:20:59,250
Come on.

956
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:22,333
Look, Neel. The dusky evening...

957
01:21:22,792 --> 01:21:24,333
...is showing the advent of the night.

958
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:30,958
Wait, wait, wait.

959
01:21:31,875 --> 01:21:33,333
Hey, let me see. Let me see.

960
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:40,625
You speak such good Bengali now.

961
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:44,458
- It is the company I keep.
- What?

962
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:06,792
Srijan. Your office has
become an office for butterflies.

963
01:22:07,583 --> 01:22:11,167
That day, I saw Icche
roaming around in the market.

964
01:22:11,833 --> 01:22:14,583
What was it? No. She was man watching.

965
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:16,750
Wow. It was great, right?

966
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:21,500
But do you know who was with
her as a bodyguard? The new entrant.

967
01:22:21,583 --> 01:22:25,292
Hey, what was his name? Lal or Neel? Neel.

968
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:29,000
He was protecting Icche quite well.

969
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:31,208
With a lot of care.

970
01:22:33,083 --> 01:22:35,958
It seems there is no discipline
in your group anymore.

971
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:39,375
Think if you want to
let this continue or not.

972
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:41,708
You must run the group.

973
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:48,333
I hope it doesn't get infected.

974
01:22:49,833 --> 01:22:51,250
Disgusting.

975
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:03,958
Hey. Icche. Get down.

976
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:07,750
What is it?
Why didn't you take my call? Tell me.

977
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:12,708
Listen. Everyone in
the group knows about us.

978
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:16,000
Uncle is very angry. He will call you too.

979
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:18,500
You will tell him about us, right?

980
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:22,375
Don't worry. I will tell him for sure.

981
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:29,917
Here you go. This is the money for your
make up. I have been carrying it around.

982
01:23:30,833 --> 01:23:32,750
I cannot take money from you.

983
01:23:33,208 --> 01:23:34,625
Why? What happened?

984
01:23:36,833 --> 01:23:38,667
I have taken a lot from you.

985
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:41,583
I cannot give anything back.

986
01:23:43,625 --> 01:23:45,500
I cannot take money.

987
01:23:48,875 --> 01:23:50,542
What are you doing?

988
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:56,292
Let me see. Let me see.

989
01:24:01,167 --> 01:24:02,667
Let me see.

990
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:08,500
My Icche.

991
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:30,417
He speaks very well.

992
01:24:33,792 --> 01:24:36,375
He looks at everything
with a different perspective.

993
01:24:38,417 --> 01:24:39,958
I like him.

994
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,625
You are in a house, Icche.

995
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:47,500
You have a talent and a big future.

996
01:24:53,792 --> 01:24:56,833
I have a lot of dreams for you, Icche.

997
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:59,208
You have to choose something.

998
01:24:59,292 --> 01:25:02,125
Either dance or relationship.

999
01:25:05,250 --> 01:25:06,917
You are an artist.

1000
01:25:08,250 --> 01:25:10,000
You know where to stop.

1001
01:25:12,917 --> 01:25:14,708
Don't get sentimental.

1002
01:25:14,792 --> 01:25:18,042
I want you to get out of that relation.

1003
01:25:32,750 --> 01:25:36,167
Don't move ahead with
your affair with Icche.

1004
01:25:38,042 --> 01:25:39,625
Icche has understood her mistake.

1005
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:44,750
- Meaning?
- Henceforth, you cannot come in our group.

1006
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:48,250
And all the messages of Icche
that you have in your mobile...

1007
01:25:48,583 --> 01:25:50,792
...should be deleted
right in front of my eyes.

1008
01:26:13,792 --> 01:26:15,750
If I delete the messages...

1009
01:26:17,333 --> 01:26:18,917
...will the relationship get over?

1010
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:22,958
Don't talk rubbish.

1011
01:26:23,667 --> 01:26:25,542
This is a one sided affair.

1012
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:33,208
Within these few months,
there are about three thousand messages.

1013
01:26:34,167 --> 01:26:35,708
And these...

1014
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:39,958
...won't be understood by you.

1015
01:26:49,292 --> 01:26:53,167
Don't be scared. I wouldn't blackmail her.

1016
01:27:01,708 --> 01:27:02,875
Will you say something?

1017
01:27:07,125 --> 01:27:09,667
She tried to tell you
earlier a lot of times.

1018
01:27:13,875 --> 01:27:15,292
You got into details of Rabindranath.

1019
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:19,667
You didn't understand love. Right?

1020
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:35,958
Take care, Icche.

1021
01:27:58,458 --> 01:28:01,375
Have you thought about our marriage?
There is a lot of pressure from home.

1022
01:28:01,583 --> 01:28:03,875
I am thinking about it.
Just around the corner...

1023
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:06,875
What will you talk about
regarding the groom's work?

1024
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:10,833
Tell them. Tell them he
is the manager of a dance group.

1025
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:12,958
No. Manager?

1026
01:28:13,875 --> 01:28:15,333
This is utter rubbish.

1027
01:28:15,667 --> 01:28:18,000
- You are just passing time.
- Is that so?

1028
01:28:18,458 --> 01:28:19,708
I am there since ten years.

1029
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:22,667
You can say whatever you wish.
They cannot function without me.

1030
01:28:23,208 --> 01:28:24,917
Oh, no. I didn't say that.

1031
01:28:25,458 --> 01:28:27,583
Tell me honestly.
What have you thought of?

1032
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:29,042
Well, I did tell you.

1033
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:31,333
Do a course of beautician.
Of decking up brides.

1034
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:34,458
And then, a dress shop.
What? Cannot you do it?

1035
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:37,125
I can.

1036
01:28:37,875 --> 01:28:39,958
So? That makes you my girl.

1037
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:45,625
Actually I feel so helpless. I.

1038
01:28:46,667 --> 01:28:48,250
What should I do? I...

1039
01:28:52,417 --> 01:28:55,792
Can I meet her once? Once...

1040
01:28:58,333 --> 01:28:59,625
Go.

1041
01:29:06,042 --> 01:29:07,583
You will get better, Icche.

1042
01:29:09,792 --> 01:29:11,167
Nothing will happen to you.

1043
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:13,208
Nothing.

1044
01:29:14,583 --> 01:29:16,042
Nothing is wrong with me.

1045
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:27,083
Friends of night. Do spread your wings.

1046
01:29:28,042 --> 01:29:29,875
It is ten at night.

1047
01:29:30,458 --> 01:29:33,042
Now Icchemotir Goppo.

1048
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:38,417
That night,
I was going back home by the last tram.

1049
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:43,125
The bright lines on the
black dark roads seemed like...

1050
01:29:43,792 --> 01:29:45,208
...seemed like two river banks.

1051
01:29:45,875 --> 01:29:47,833
And it seemed the tram
was flowing through it.

1052
01:29:48,792 --> 01:29:51,583
And then, I heard a sound.

1053
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:54,000
Like a pain.

1054
01:29:54,792 --> 01:29:57,208
It seemed that Icche(wish)...

1055
01:29:57,958 --> 01:29:59,208
...was crying.

1056
01:29:59,833 --> 01:30:01,417
I went out to look for you.

1057
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,583
Tram left me behind and went ahead.

1058
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:08,500
It was a dark road and I went ahead.

1059
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,875
I am looking for you from this FM station.

1060
01:30:19,125 --> 01:30:23,917
You will stay forever.

1061
01:30:24,417 --> 01:30:25,750
Srijan.

1062
01:30:27,417 --> 01:30:30,583
It was not right on your
part to take a one sided decision.

1063
01:30:31,083 --> 01:30:34,208
- Regarding what?
- About Neel and Icche.

1064
01:30:37,917 --> 01:30:41,000
Why? Icche didn't say anything either.

1065
01:30:41,417 --> 01:30:44,042
And for me,
my group members mean the most.

1066
01:30:45,042 --> 01:30:48,042
A person like you should
have heard both the aspects.

1067
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:52,625
I am not a judge.

1068
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:57,250
But regarding Icche,
I was right the other day.

1069
01:30:59,125 --> 01:31:00,833
I have to run such a big group.

1070
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,583
That is why I need to protect everyone.

1071
01:31:04,375 --> 01:31:06,208
I cannot break the group, right?

1072
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:07,833
Icche gets late.

1073
01:31:09,875 --> 01:31:12,292
Can you keep everyone's
mobile switched off?

1074
01:31:14,958 --> 01:31:16,833
Do you listen to FM at ten in the night?

1075
01:31:18,458 --> 01:31:20,792
Do you listen to it
at ten in the night, Srijan?

1076
01:31:25,458 --> 01:31:27,667
That boy talks so well.

1077
01:31:29,167 --> 01:31:30,792
That sound of the anklet.

1078
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,583
It has gone somewhere else.

1079
01:31:34,333 --> 01:31:37,708
But yet, I hold on to the smell of home.

1080
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:43,000
I have created a house in
the heart of Icchemoti. A storm.

1081
01:31:43,208 --> 01:31:47,125
Came and did away with that house of mine.

1082
01:31:47,333 --> 01:31:50,417
Find Icche for me. Find Icche for me.

1083
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:55,542
If anyone can see her.
If anyone can see her.

1084
01:31:55,625 --> 01:31:57,958
Get my Icchemoti to me.

1085
01:32:00,917 --> 01:32:02,875
On this night of 21st February.

1086
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:07,125
I will finish this session
with a poet of Bengal.

1087
01:32:09,042 --> 01:32:11,792
All of you who have
floated with me till now.

1088
01:32:12,292 --> 01:32:14,000
All of you who couldn't float or...

1089
01:32:14,583 --> 01:32:16,542
...ones who were scared to do so.

1090
01:32:17,083 --> 01:32:18,500
For all of them.

1091
01:32:19,417 --> 01:32:20,667
In your language, Icche.

1092
01:32:21,750 --> 01:32:23,583
Let there be dreams in your eyes.

1093
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:28,542
This house that I have created.

1094
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:32,375
I have been crying to make it my own.

1095
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:35,375
The one who has possessed me.

1096
01:32:39,792 --> 01:32:42,250
The one who has shattered my house.

1097
01:32:42,792 --> 01:32:44,417
I don't hold grudges.

1098
01:32:46,833 --> 01:32:50,792
- The one who has left me makes me cry.
- Open the door. Open the door.

1099
01:32:53,708 --> 01:32:56,000
The one who has shot
a poisoned arrow at me.

1100
01:32:56,708 --> 01:32:58,750
I will give her a heart full of songs.

1101
01:33:00,917 --> 01:33:05,375
Despite getting thorns,
I will give her flowers for all my life.

1102
01:33:06,208 --> 01:33:08,375
I cry to make her mine.

1103
01:33:08,792 --> 01:33:10,750
The one who has made me a stranger.

1104
01:33:22,792 --> 01:33:25,292
Sir. Srijan.

1105
01:33:26,750 --> 01:33:28,250
How is she, doctor?

1106
01:33:29,667 --> 01:33:34,083
Actually it is a case of
serious psychological disorder.

1107
01:33:35,708 --> 01:33:39,000
In this condition,
one needs to be close to one's own family.

1108
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:41,417
She has to take regular medication.

1109
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:44,000
One needs to keep an eye on the patient.

1110
01:33:44,375 --> 01:33:46,958
But such a huge incident happened.

1111
01:33:47,292 --> 01:33:48,958
None of you could
understand anything earlier?

1112
01:33:49,417 --> 01:33:50,792
Everything seemed fine.

1113
01:33:51,292 --> 01:33:53,042
I don't know what
happened all of a sudden.

1114
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:56,292
- Listen. Do any of you know anything?
- Listen.

1115
01:33:56,417 --> 01:33:57,792
Did something happen
with the photographer?

1116
01:33:57,917 --> 01:34:00,792
Anyway. I will release
the patient tomorrow.

1117
01:34:01,792 --> 01:34:04,125
Do keep an eye on her.

1118
01:34:04,583 --> 01:34:08,542
And actually she needs warmth and care.

1119
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:11,000
- I am leaving. Greetings.
- Greetings.

1120
01:34:12,833 --> 01:34:13,917
Come on.

1121
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,792
I had told you Icche can stay with me.

1122
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,083
She is my responsibility.

1123
01:34:34,500 --> 01:34:37,083
One shouldn't do anything
wrong by getting emotional.

1124
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:40,125
God knows when she will get better.

1125
01:34:40,542 --> 01:34:41,792
You don't have to worry about it.

1126
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:45,083
I am responsible for her.

1127
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:49,792
We are not talking about that.
Who will pay for the expenses?

1128
01:34:55,542 --> 01:34:57,042
Don't be angry, Sriti.

1129
01:34:59,125 --> 01:35:00,750
This is about circumstances.

1130
01:35:02,500 --> 01:35:03,958
One needs to be patient.

1131
01:35:05,625 --> 01:35:07,250
At the end, it might become a liability.

1132
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:12,750
Srijan. You know I
can take on liabilities.

1133
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:17,583
Icche is like my daughter.

1134
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,708
I had taken her as one
of my own just like you.

1135
01:35:21,875 --> 01:35:24,708
What? You didn't even like her.

1136
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:28,417
And apart from that, there were a lot of
problems in the group about this.

1137
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:29,500
Yes.

1138
01:35:30,583 --> 01:35:32,000
That was way earlier.

1139
01:35:32,958 --> 01:35:34,292
You don't know anything.

1140
01:35:35,750 --> 01:35:38,292
I never liked her behaviour. But...

1141
01:35:38,375 --> 01:35:40,458
I respect her as an artist.

1142
01:35:40,917 --> 01:35:43,125
Right. You have never said that.

1143
01:35:43,208 --> 01:35:46,833
- You never told Icche that she dances well.
- No. I didn't.

1144
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:50,583
What if she became proud?

1145
01:35:53,542 --> 01:35:56,167
When I see her on stage,
I feel she is like me.

1146
01:36:14,042 --> 01:36:16,583
- Have it. Have it.
- Have it. Open your mouth.

1147
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:18,875
- My dear girl.
- I will have it later.

1148
01:36:18,958 --> 01:36:20,250
Open your mouth. Come on.

1149
01:36:20,417 --> 01:36:21,625
- Have it. Don't do this.
- No.

1150
01:36:21,708 --> 01:36:22,125
Have it.

1151
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:25,625
I have never seen such a nice girl.
Darling. Good girl.

1152
01:36:26,542 --> 01:36:28,250
Let me see. Yes.

1153
01:36:28,708 --> 01:36:30,417
Here you are. One more. More.

1154
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:32,375
- One more. One more. One more.
- Yes. Yes.

1155
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:34,875
- Water. Water. Water. Water.
- Let it be. Let it be.

1156
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:38,000
Don't do this, darling.
Let me see. Let me see.

1157
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:42,792
Oh, no. Bless you. Bless you.

1158
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:46,792
Here I am.
I am right here. Here I am. Right here.

1159
01:36:56,500 --> 01:36:57,833
Where am I?

1160
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:04,375
- This is your house.
- What?

1161
01:37:08,417 --> 01:37:09,875
I will not stay here.

1162
01:37:10,167 --> 01:37:11,542
I don't like it.

1163
01:37:11,958 --> 01:37:13,083
I don't like it.

1164
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:14,833
Darling. Don't do this.

1165
01:37:15,208 --> 01:37:17,458
Stay here for a few days.
You will like it.

1166
01:37:17,667 --> 01:37:19,167
Yes. I am right here.

1167
01:37:21,167 --> 01:37:23,833
I don't like it. I don't like it.

1168
01:37:24,708 --> 01:37:26,000
I don't like it.

1169
01:37:28,583 --> 01:37:30,042
No.

1170
01:37:45,792 --> 01:37:47,250
Darling daughter of mine.

1171
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,208
You have to get well.

1172
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:53,375
Sriti.

1173
01:37:54,042 --> 01:37:56,667
She is taking care of you.

1174
01:37:59,292 --> 01:38:01,542
I couldn't have done it.

1175
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:04,917
Get well, dear.

1176
01:38:17,875 --> 01:38:19,417
Icche.

1177
01:38:23,417 --> 01:38:24,875
How are you?

1178
01:38:35,792 --> 01:38:38,792
Icche. Icche.

1179
01:39:03,708 --> 01:39:05,042
Sit here.

1180
01:39:11,583 --> 01:39:12,750
Come on.

1181
01:39:45,875 --> 01:39:47,250
You?

1182
01:39:48,083 --> 01:39:49,500
I am Rupam.

1183
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:52,375
I have clicked a lot
of photos of your group.

1184
01:39:52,958 --> 01:39:56,125
Well, I have come here to...

1185
01:39:57,083 --> 01:39:59,042
- ...know how Icche is.
- She isn't fine.

1186
01:39:59,375 --> 01:40:01,250
Can I meet her once?

1187
01:40:01,542 --> 01:40:03,000
Doctor has told her not to.

1188
01:40:03,083 --> 01:40:04,875
No, no. I won't take long.

1189
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:06,750
Actually I was worried.

1190
01:40:07,750 --> 01:40:10,625
I know. But there is no way.

1191
01:40:13,417 --> 01:40:14,958
Look. I guess you don't know.

1192
01:40:15,500 --> 01:40:16,792
We have a relationship.

1193
01:40:17,167 --> 01:40:19,125
In fact, we have talked
about marriage too.

1194
01:40:19,417 --> 01:40:21,167
Let her get well first.

1195
01:40:23,667 --> 01:40:24,958
And then, you can...

1196
01:40:29,708 --> 01:40:31,750
Can I get your number at least?

1197
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:33,625
I don't have a phone.

1198
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,458
Give me your number.

1199
01:40:38,333 --> 01:40:39,875
I can give a call if need be.

1200
01:40:39,958 --> 01:40:41,375
Yes. Sure. Sure.

1201
01:40:45,583 --> 01:40:48,917
Please. Do make a call and let me know.

1202
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:17,625
Do you recognise me?

1203
01:41:17,708 --> 01:41:19,000
Well, tell me.

1204
01:41:19,625 --> 01:41:21,583
Can you meet me once?

1205
01:41:22,792 --> 01:41:24,750
This is Sriti.

1206
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,583
Me?

1207
01:41:45,708 --> 01:41:47,083
Why? Can you tell me?

1208
01:41:48,042 --> 01:41:50,250
Actually I really need to meet you.

1209
01:41:51,042 --> 01:41:52,417
Meet me?

1210
01:41:53,875 --> 01:41:55,167
Okay.

1211
01:41:56,208 --> 01:41:58,583
- When?
- Today.

1212
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:01,250
- In the evening.
- Where?

1213
01:42:02,292 --> 01:42:03,542
At my place.

1214
01:42:06,125 --> 01:42:07,625
Is there a problem?

1215
01:42:07,917 --> 01:42:09,125
Come.

1216
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:12,000
We will talk when you come.

1217
01:42:13,083 --> 01:42:14,375
Do come.

1218
01:42:15,542 --> 01:42:17,250
I will wait for you.

1219
01:42:36,250 --> 01:42:37,792
So much has happened.

1220
01:42:39,458 --> 01:42:40,833
I didn't come to know.

1221
01:42:46,375 --> 01:42:47,750
I need your help.

1222
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,458
I know you can do it.

1223
01:42:52,417 --> 01:42:55,083
I don't know what you
mean but I will be there.

1224
01:42:58,083 --> 01:42:59,500
I think...

1225
01:43:00,375 --> 01:43:02,500
...it wouldn't be right
for her to see me right...

1226
01:43:02,583 --> 01:43:04,333
...now considering
the condition she is in.

1227
01:43:05,375 --> 01:43:07,000
Initially it wouldn't be fine.

1228
01:43:08,292 --> 01:43:11,417
But you make so many people's
wishes come true everday.

1229
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:13,792
No. It isn't so. But...

1230
01:43:15,417 --> 01:43:16,958
I am feeling bad.

1231
01:43:17,042 --> 01:43:18,708
Icche is an artist.

1232
01:43:20,292 --> 01:43:22,417
The fact that she has got lost...

1233
01:43:24,417 --> 01:43:26,583
...made me realise I
was afraid of getting lost.

1234
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:30,542
And it is still there.

1235
01:43:36,792 --> 01:43:39,042
I have taken up a big responsibility.

1236
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:44,042
Okay.

1237
01:43:45,667 --> 01:43:47,833
I know she has a relationship.

1238
01:43:49,375 --> 01:43:51,167
If we make use of it, maybe...

1239
01:43:54,125 --> 01:43:55,792
Do you want to move away?

1240
01:43:56,042 --> 01:43:57,458
Do you think so?

1241
01:44:01,625 --> 01:44:03,708
The more I move, the closer I get.

1242
01:44:04,125 --> 01:44:05,458
Where are you going?

1243
01:44:06,667 --> 01:44:07,792
To Icche's room.

1244
01:44:13,708 --> 01:44:16,042
I didn't take help from a wrong person.

1245
01:44:27,750 --> 01:44:29,167
Icche.

1246
01:45:17,917 --> 01:45:19,250
What happened?

1247
01:45:21,833 --> 01:45:23,542
- Icche.
- Why did you come?

1248
01:45:25,125 --> 01:45:26,500
Why did he come?

1249
01:45:26,792 --> 01:45:28,042
Does he want photos?

1250
01:45:31,583 --> 01:45:32,792
Get well.

1251
01:45:34,083 --> 01:45:37,083
We will click a lot of photos
when you go to the stage again.

1252
01:45:45,208 --> 01:45:47,750
Icche. Icche.

1253
01:45:50,042 --> 01:45:51,917
I don't see...

1254
01:45:53,708 --> 01:45:55,250
...any signs that Icche will get well.

1255
01:45:57,750 --> 01:45:59,000
I was thinking...

1256
01:46:00,792 --> 01:46:02,625
...of consulting another doctor.

1257
01:46:03,708 --> 01:46:06,250
Aunt. I was thinking of the same thing.

1258
01:46:08,208 --> 01:46:10,292
But it will be very expensive, right?

1259
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:15,125
Don't worry about it.

1260
01:46:16,458 --> 01:46:18,042
We are here.

1261
01:46:23,792 --> 01:46:25,875
I have some jewelry.

1262
01:46:27,458 --> 01:46:28,875
For her.

1263
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:38,042
Her marriage isn't...

1264
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:41,583
Why do you accept defeat so easily, aunt?

1265
01:46:43,500 --> 01:46:45,000
Keep the jewelry.

1266
01:46:47,583 --> 01:46:49,125
What can be done?

1267
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,958
No one else from the group...

1268
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:54,000
...comes here at all.

1269
01:46:54,917 --> 01:46:56,542
Forget about them, Kanchan.

1270
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:59,500
All of them are merely puppets.

1271
01:47:00,167 --> 01:47:01,792
Feeling. Conscience.
Do they have anything?

1272
01:47:03,042 --> 01:47:04,875
- Sit.
- Yes.

1273
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,250
Well, aunt. Aunt. Tell me.

1274
01:47:15,792 --> 01:47:19,125
Sometime back,
Icche used to lead this group alone.

1275
01:47:19,875 --> 01:47:22,500
She has performed in so many shows alone.

1276
01:47:24,208 --> 01:47:26,708
Today, in order to
get someone to visit her...

1277
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:30,250
God knows what happened.

1278
01:47:31,542 --> 01:47:32,917
God knows.

1279
01:47:35,750 --> 01:47:37,250
Right now...

1280
01:47:37,625 --> 01:47:39,917
...she was getting attention
from everyone, right?

1281
01:47:43,750 --> 01:47:45,167
Let her get well.

1282
01:47:49,458 --> 01:47:50,833
What are you doing?

1283
01:47:52,333 --> 01:47:54,125
You stopped me.

1284
01:47:54,875 --> 01:47:56,667
Aunt. She is a girl of my group.

1285
01:47:58,333 --> 01:47:59,833
She is like my daughter.

1286
01:48:00,958 --> 01:48:02,708
I will get her back to stage.

1287
01:48:29,750 --> 01:48:33,333
What is it, Kanchan?
Did you not meet your girl today?

1288
01:48:33,583 --> 01:48:36,458
No, sister. I don't...

1289
01:48:36,833 --> 01:48:38,208
...feel scared of her anymore.

1290
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:41,292
Did you get married?

1291
01:48:44,292 --> 01:48:46,833
- Let it be. Let it be.
- Sister. We got a registry done.

1292
01:48:47,333 --> 01:48:49,000
I have delayed it a lot. No more.

1293
01:48:50,667 --> 01:48:52,125
Good job.

1294
01:48:53,292 --> 01:48:55,583
This is the first good
job that you have done.

1295
01:48:57,125 --> 01:48:59,708
Bless you. Bless you. Be happy.

1296
01:49:04,375 --> 01:49:06,292
- Tell me.
- Sister.

1297
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:08,583
Whatever I am about to do...

1298
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:11,000
...shouldn't be turned down by you.

1299
01:49:14,292 --> 01:49:15,542
Give it.

1300
01:49:19,917 --> 01:49:21,333
What is this?

1301
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:30,875
Sister. This has five thousand rupees.

1302
01:49:32,125 --> 01:49:34,292
For Icche's treatment.

1303
01:49:37,458 --> 01:49:40,875
Sister. This is not earned by sin, sister.

1304
01:49:41,708 --> 01:49:43,625
I have saved it, sister.

1305
01:49:43,958 --> 01:49:46,875
We have spent some on our registry.

1306
01:49:47,167 --> 01:49:48,583
The rest is here.

1307
01:49:48,917 --> 01:49:51,542
This isn't money earned by sin. Trust me.

1308
01:49:52,958 --> 01:49:55,750
Okay. Keep it with you for now.

1309
01:49:56,792 --> 01:49:58,833
If need be, I will ask you for it.

1310
01:50:03,417 --> 01:50:06,083
Sister. Don't give it back.

1311
01:50:09,083 --> 01:50:10,583
- Give it.
- Yes.

1312
01:50:16,667 --> 01:50:18,000
Sister.

1313
01:50:19,583 --> 01:50:21,500
He is not lowly, right?

1314
01:50:59,083 --> 01:51:00,500
Come.

1315
01:51:40,958 --> 01:51:42,292
Sister Icche.

1316
01:51:43,792 --> 01:51:45,125
Icche.

1317
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,067
You are doing well.

1318
01:52:36,692 --> 01:52:40,192
Tell me. When will you
start the program again?

1319
01:52:43,608 --> 01:52:45,108
How do you feel? Tell me.

1320
01:52:47,192 --> 01:52:49,025
I feel very sleepy.

1321
01:52:51,442 --> 01:52:53,025
I feel tired.

1322
01:52:53,733 --> 01:52:55,400
She is very weak.

1323
01:52:56,317 --> 01:52:59,442
If she doesn't eat anything.
What will happen?

1324
01:53:04,650 --> 01:53:06,067
What do you like to eat?

1325
01:53:08,400 --> 01:53:09,817
What do you feel like eating?

1326
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:14,692
Eat whatever you feel like eating.

1327
01:53:16,858 --> 01:53:21,108
And you must eat. Or else,
where will you get energy for a comeback?

1328
01:53:24,900 --> 01:53:26,317
Do something.

1329
01:53:27,317 --> 01:53:29,192
Leave these familiar situation.

1330
01:53:29,275 --> 01:53:32,150
Go outside to a new place for an outing.

1331
01:53:32,858 --> 01:53:35,692
It should be open and
in natural surroundings.

1332
01:53:35,942 --> 01:53:38,650
Near a mountain, jungle or a sea.
Wherever you wish.

1333
01:54:09,942 --> 01:54:15,067
"I decorated the sky for you."

1334
01:54:15,858 --> 01:54:21,817
"I drew the river.
And threw in some stars for you."

1335
01:54:21,900 --> 01:54:27,108
"I sent some colours for
you out through the windows."

1336
01:54:27,358 --> 01:54:33,900
"I have made a house out of clouds
for you because you were about to visit."

1337
01:54:33,983 --> 01:54:35,983
"For you."

1338
01:54:36,900 --> 01:54:38,900
"For you."

1339
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:41,942
"For you."

1340
01:54:42,942 --> 01:54:45,900
"For you."

1341
01:54:45,983 --> 01:54:48,358
"For you."

1342
01:54:48,525 --> 01:54:51,358
"For you."

1343
01:54:51,442 --> 01:54:54,817
"For you."

1344
01:54:54,983 --> 01:54:57,733
"For you."

1345
01:54:59,692 --> 01:55:00,942
Click photos.

1346
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:08,108
You should keep some photos
in the canvas of your heart.

1347
01:55:11,150 --> 01:55:13,858
No. You cannot do anything.

1348
01:55:14,650 --> 01:55:15,900
He could.

1349
01:55:15,983 --> 01:55:21,733
"Stars play Raag Asavari
with their clarinet."

1350
01:55:21,858 --> 01:55:27,608
"It seems the cloud fairies
are wearing anklets and dancing."

1351
01:55:29,858 --> 01:55:31,608
Hold my hand, Icche. You will fall down.

1352
01:55:33,983 --> 01:55:38,567
"Stars play Raag Asavari
with their clarinet."

1353
01:55:39,817 --> 01:55:44,900
"It seems the cloud fairies are
wearing anklets and dancing." - I can.

1354
01:55:45,483 --> 01:55:51,817
"In order to decorate your sky,
my sky seems clear."

1355
01:55:51,983 --> 01:55:56,942
"I have lost myself because of you.
For you."

1356
01:55:57,858 --> 01:55:59,817
"For you."

1357
01:56:00,817 --> 01:56:06,275
"For you. For you."

1358
01:56:06,442 --> 01:56:08,858
""For you."

1359
01:56:09,400 --> 01:56:12,317
"For you."

1360
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:15,983
"For you."

1361
01:56:16,442 --> 01:56:20,067
"For you."

1362
01:56:33,358 --> 01:56:35,275
How far is that mountain?

1363
01:56:36,817 --> 01:56:38,108
If you think it is far, it is far.

1364
01:56:39,067 --> 01:56:40,400
If you think it is close,
it will seem close.

1365
01:56:41,525 --> 01:56:42,733
Can you see it?

1366
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,483
I want to go to that mountain.

1367
01:56:52,733 --> 01:56:54,400
We are on a mountain.

1368
01:56:55,983 --> 01:56:59,150
There is no need to go to that mountain.

1369
01:57:07,442 --> 01:57:08,858
Tell me you cannot take me.

1370
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:26,150
"And yet, I decorate the morning skies."

1371
01:57:26,233 --> 01:57:31,150
"And in the evening, I light a lamp."

1372
01:57:32,442 --> 01:57:38,150
"And yet, I decorate the morning skies."

1373
01:57:38,233 --> 01:57:43,233
"And in the evening, I light a lamp."

1374
01:57:44,483 --> 01:57:46,983
"This sky of mine."

1375
01:57:47,442 --> 01:57:53,400
"Is not given to anyone else but you,
Icchemoti."

1376
01:57:53,483 --> 01:57:55,442
"For you."

1377
01:57:56,775 --> 01:57:59,358
"For you."

1378
01:57:59,442 --> 01:58:02,150
"For you."

1379
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:04,525
"For you."

1380
01:58:04,692 --> 01:58:07,775
"For you."

1381
01:58:07,942 --> 01:58:10,525
"For you."

1382
01:58:10,983 --> 01:58:14,733
"For you."

1383
01:58:15,358 --> 01:58:19,275
"For you."

1384
01:58:19,942 --> 01:58:22,233
"For you."

1385
01:58:22,983 --> 01:58:26,358
"For you."

1386
01:58:26,442 --> 01:58:29,817
"For you."

1387
01:59:39,650 --> 01:59:46,192
"In my heart. Everyday."

1388
01:59:47,317 --> 01:59:51,858
"Who is dancing?"

1389
02:00:20,108 --> 02:00:27,150
"I am so happy. I am so happy.
I am so happy. Day and night."

1390
02:00:27,358 --> 02:00:30,692
"Freedom dances.
And it seems bonds also dance."

1391
02:00:30,775 --> 02:00:37,817
"I am so happy. I am so happy.
I am so happy. Day and night."

1392
02:00:37,900 --> 02:00:41,400
"Freedom dances.
And it seems bonds also dance."

1393
02:00:41,483 --> 02:00:45,025
"On this tide and the free colours."

1394
02:00:45,108 --> 02:00:52,150
"Along with me,
dancing on a beautiful rhythm."

1395
02:00:52,192 --> 02:00:55,692
"On this tide and the free colours."

1396
02:00:55,775 --> 02:01:03,192
"Along with me,
dancing on a beautiful rhythm."

1397
02:01:51,108 --> 02:01:52,567
Look. Your photo.

1398
02:01:56,900 --> 02:01:59,983
What? What is this? Neel.

1399
02:02:00,150 --> 02:02:03,483
The entire city is ready
to hear your dancing anklets.

1400
02:02:06,233 --> 02:02:08,775
I cannot do this. I am not ready.

1401
02:02:08,858 --> 02:02:11,150
Dance is in your blood and dreams.

1402
02:02:12,233 --> 02:02:16,150
This isn't possible.
I don't know anything.

1403
02:02:18,150 --> 02:02:20,025
I have not rehearsed.

1404
02:02:20,483 --> 02:02:23,900
Okay. Don't take pressure on yourself.
Srijan is there. You can do it.

1405
02:02:27,567 --> 02:02:29,400
- Oh, no.
- This is broken.

1406
02:02:29,567 --> 02:02:31,983
- This will be it.
- You are breaking it a lot.

1407
02:02:32,150 --> 02:02:32,942
- Okay?
- We are here.

1408
02:02:33,025 --> 02:02:34,650
- We are here. We are here.
- Expressions...

1409
02:02:34,733 --> 02:02:38,317
We are here.
We are here. It is time for celebration.

1410
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:41,858
Sister Icche is here.
Have sweets. Have sweets. Have sweets.

1411
02:02:42,150 --> 02:02:43,650
Icche will be here in some time.

1412
02:02:43,733 --> 02:02:44,858
Take it. Take it. Yes.

1413
02:02:44,942 --> 02:02:47,108
Listen.
Icche will come later during the day.

1414
02:02:47,525 --> 02:02:50,150
- And do remember. Arpan. Smita.
- Yes.

1415
02:02:50,192 --> 02:02:53,067
Everyone.
No one should be too excited.

1416
02:02:56,900 --> 02:03:00,067
Have it. You didn't let
us know about the marriage.

1417
02:03:00,817 --> 02:03:02,483
I have got it. Take it.

1418
02:03:04,817 --> 02:03:07,108
Keep quiet. Don't talk too much.

1419
02:03:07,525 --> 02:03:08,817
- Hey, look.
- Look.

1420
02:03:08,900 --> 02:03:11,067
- Oh, no.
- It would be nice if we started the dance.

1421
02:03:13,400 --> 02:03:17,150
How strange.
Look. The river went to a mountain.

1422
02:03:18,567 --> 02:03:20,942
With a lot of affection and love.

1423
02:03:21,900 --> 02:03:24,358
Icchemoti went to a mountain.

1424
02:03:25,983 --> 02:03:28,025
The dawn's sun and night's moon.

1425
02:03:28,900 --> 02:03:31,025
She saw them in the clouds.

1426
02:03:32,733 --> 02:03:34,442
Do you want to see Icchemoti?

1427
02:03:35,525 --> 02:03:37,483
So come to Rabindra Manch.

1428
02:03:37,567 --> 02:03:40,775
Next 16th. On Sunday. At 6.30.

1429
02:03:43,067 --> 02:03:44,692
Everyone holding their oars...

1430
02:03:45,483 --> 02:03:47,025
...can foat for sure.

1431
02:03:49,733 --> 02:03:51,442
This big city.

1432
02:03:51,900 --> 02:03:54,275
It seems memories have
done away with the dust...

1433
02:03:54,358 --> 02:03:57,150
...on the pages of memories
and roaming here and there.

1434
02:03:58,192 --> 02:03:59,608
Do you remember?

1435
02:04:00,025 --> 02:04:03,692
The sound of my anklets...

1436
02:04:03,942 --> 02:04:06,108
...woke you up from your sleep?

1437
02:04:07,067 --> 02:04:10,275
My beautiful eyes. And my smile.

1438
02:04:10,358 --> 02:04:12,983
It seemed they were like
a thousand watt bulb for you.

1439
02:04:14,067 --> 02:04:18,733
With this beauty of mine,
I have burnt a lot of people like you.

1440
02:04:19,192 --> 02:04:22,275
But I have burnt myself a lot too.

1441
02:04:23,942 --> 02:04:27,108
Ani. These days,
there are no dawns in my sky.

1442
02:04:27,817 --> 02:04:33,192
When it rains, I have forgotten
the smell of wed mud, Ani.

1443
02:04:34,483 --> 02:04:36,400
You told me I am your river.

1444
02:04:36,608 --> 02:04:39,483
You said our love was like a guerilla war.

1445
02:04:39,567 --> 02:04:44,150
On hearing this, what should I do? Should
I split the sky open with my howling?

1446
02:04:45,067 --> 02:04:47,817
Ani. Release me from your canvas.

1447
02:04:48,025 --> 02:04:49,775
Your colours are drying up.

1448
02:04:49,942 --> 02:04:52,192
My eyes are still left to be drawn.

1449
02:04:52,692 --> 02:04:56,983
You used to tell me that to draw my eyes,
you have to see the monsoon skies.

1450
02:04:57,317 --> 02:05:01,858
So many monsoons have gone by. And yet,
your painting brush didn't paint my eyes.

1451
02:05:03,650 --> 02:05:06,650
Ani. On this canvas...

1452
02:05:06,817 --> 02:05:09,858
...that fire coloured saree of mine.

1453
02:05:09,942 --> 02:05:11,358
Change it.

1454
02:05:11,942 --> 02:05:15,525
I feel scared of fire.

1455
02:05:17,233 --> 02:05:20,775
Ani. Ani. Your paint brush.

1456
02:05:21,067 --> 02:05:23,400
Seems like playing
like a musical instrument.

1457
02:05:23,983 --> 02:05:25,942
I have come out of the canvas.

1458
02:05:26,358 --> 02:05:29,650
Someone has bloomed flowers in this city.

1459
02:05:29,775 --> 02:05:32,483
Ani. Those are the fairies.

1460
02:05:32,650 --> 02:05:35,150
Ani. Look. There are lamps on the sky.

1461
02:05:35,233 --> 02:05:37,608
So many clouds have held on to me.

1462
02:05:37,692 --> 02:05:40,567
Ani. Make my veil fly in the sky, Ani.

1463
02:05:40,650 --> 02:05:42,733
Make my veil fly in the sky.

1464
02:05:42,817 --> 02:05:46,525
Ani. Ani. You are mine, Ani.

1465
02:05:47,192 --> 02:05:50,650
You are just mine, Ani. Just mine.

1466
02:06:21,983 --> 02:06:24,692
- Great. Great.
- Thank you, Srijan.

1467
02:06:24,775 --> 02:06:27,067
You look so sweet.

1468
02:06:27,192 --> 02:06:29,192
Oh my dear. My dear.

1469
02:06:29,275 --> 02:06:32,358
Hey. Send them. Send the
cups of tea inside the green room.

1470
02:06:32,608 --> 02:06:34,192
One must have tea at the end of the show.

1471
02:06:34,442 --> 02:06:36,483
Hey. Come in. Come in.

1472
02:06:36,567 --> 02:06:39,317
- Great. Sit down. Sit down.
- Yes. Yes.

1473
02:06:39,525 --> 02:06:41,567
- Yes.
- You are the king today.

1474
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:42,567
Yes.

1475
02:06:42,650 --> 02:06:45,567
- Hey, hey, thank you.
- The dance was amazing.

1476
02:06:45,650 --> 02:06:48,608
But nothing can be compared
to whatever Neel has written.

1477
02:06:48,692 --> 02:06:50,233
Well, Icche is not in the make up room.

1478
02:06:50,317 --> 02:06:51,775
What? Where is she?

1479
02:06:52,358 --> 02:06:54,192
- Not even in the washroom.
- What?

1480
02:06:57,192 --> 02:06:59,567
- Hey. Where is sister?
- Hey, Neel. Neel.

1481
02:06:59,650 --> 02:07:00,358
I don't know. I don't know.

1482
02:07:00,442 --> 02:07:02,858
- Your writing was great. It was amazing.
- Yes.

1483
02:07:03,442 --> 02:07:05,942
- Hey, where is sister?
- I don't know.

1484
02:07:06,817 --> 02:07:09,150
What do you mean?
Where did you see her last?

1485
02:07:09,358 --> 02:07:12,483
She told me she is coming
but I don't know where she went.

1486
02:07:17,025 --> 02:07:18,567
I am sure something has happened.

1487
02:07:19,150 --> 02:07:20,442
Do you know something?

1488
02:07:21,150 --> 02:07:22,900
Neel. Icche is missing.

1489
02:07:23,150 --> 02:07:25,400
What do you mean? Where is she?

1490
02:08:08,275 --> 02:08:11,442
I don't have the capability to thank you.

1491
02:08:12,483 --> 02:08:15,608
I don't know whether
to ask for forgiveness or not.

1492
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:19,817
My shame resides with me.

1493
02:08:21,150 --> 02:08:24,317
And your love remains within us.

1494
02:08:25,067 --> 02:08:26,567
Take care.
