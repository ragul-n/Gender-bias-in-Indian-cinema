1
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,400
Boss, we came to know
where the girl is.

2
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,700
Stop!

3
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,400
Very good.

4
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,300
Cut. Who are you and
what are you doing?

5
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,000
Shailu! Are you all
right? Ambulance.

6
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,400
Dad, I am fine.

7
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:30,800
Director Sir, is shot ok?

8
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
The money also is ok. With
this, except the climax song..

9
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,600
..total film is completed.
Bring the mirror here.

10
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,900
Ready sir.

11
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,400
You go madam.

12
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,400
O my God, From the moment
I became the producer..

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,600
..of this picture, my blood
pleasure is increasing.

14
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,700
Whenever that girl is hurt,
I am getting a..

15
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,000
..heart attack thinking that
the shooting will stop.

16
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,600
Though this is her
first picture..

17
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,800
..your daughters performance
is wonderful.

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Give me the dates for
her for the next movie.

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,700
For whom are you taking that
juice? To the fight master sir.

20
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,900
When the running is done
by my daughter, ..

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600
..why does the master need
the juice? Put it there.

22
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,400
Sir, this check? For whom are
you taking that cigarette?

23
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,400
To the director sir. When fight
master did all the fighting, ..

24
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,700
..why are you giving that
cigarette to the director?

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,900
Put it there.

26
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,500
Sir, this cheque..
- It is not possible in one.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,700
I will consider if it is two
and do if it is three.

28
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,400
You, man with the moustache,
do not prolong the matter.

29
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
Agree immediately. Any
heroine who works in..

30
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,400
.. my movies will go quite high.

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,400
Look here Ranga Rao.

32
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,600
It seems that the next
song is very difficult.

33
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,600
You must do the rehearsal
all through the night and..

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,800
Not possible. It is
not possible for me.

35
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,300
Please do not say that. This
is a very important song.

36
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,000
No, I cannot do that. How can I?

37
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,600
It is not you but your daughter
who is going to dance.

38
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
That is what I call
extra speech.

39
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,800
Are you a sadist? She worked
the full day today.

40
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,900
And you want her to
work tomorrow also?

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,300
My daughter and me are tired
and are going abroad for rest.

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,500
See Ranga Rao, what is this?

43
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,400
I will be doomed. What
is this nonsense..

44
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,900
.. in the first movie itself?

45
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,400
Madam, you have come
just in time.

46
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,500
There is one last song tomorrow
and the rehearsals are tonight.

47
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,700
Your father is saying it
will not be possible.

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,400
When I told my decision why
are you speaking to her

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,900
Father, I will do if. it

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,900
Director Sir, please send
the dance assistant.

51
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,400
Look here Producer, this is
an extra song and is not..

52
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,200
..there in the agreed dates. I
will need extra money for this.

53
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,400
Ok, go now.

54
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,600
Hey, that producer said that
he will send biryani for us.

55
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
Go and bring it.
- Yes sir.

56
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,700
Dont eat it on the way.

57
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,200
Why are you standing at the
doorstep? - What happened mother?

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,800
Hello Badri Why
have you come?

59
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,900
Is everyone fine in your home?

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
I was planning to
return your money..

61
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,300
Father! Mother!

62
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,800
Hello!
- This is me Kona Ranga Rao.

63
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,000
What is the matter?

64
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
That Badri came and
took away my daughter.

65
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,400
What a disaster?! If the market
knows this I will be doomed.

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:33,400
Dont break this news to
anyone. Dont call the police.

67
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,600
I know the home Minister well.
I shall take his help.

68
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,700
You be quiet.

69
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,400
If you ask us to inaugurate a
movie or to switch on the camera..

70
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,400
..or to attend the 100 days
function we can do that.

71
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,900
But this thing will
be difficult.

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,800
And that too Bhadram is
not an ordinary man.

73
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
He is the source
of all our funds

74
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,600
and votes and in
Telangana region.

75
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
If I take him on I
will be in trouble.

76
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,700
That is not the matter Sir.
The life of that girl..

77
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,300
Nothing will happen to her.
Just keep quiet for a few days.

78
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,400
He will leave her after
he gets bored with her.

79
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,200
She, she is my daughter.

80
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Did you not remember this
when you cheated Badri?

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,500
Sir, I have big dreams of
making her a famous heroine.

82
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,400
I too have dreams
of becoming a CM.

83
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,500
Did I succeed? Did I not adjust
with the home Ministry?

84
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,600
What can we do if you too say
like that? Hey producer..

85
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,700
I dont have the time now. I
have a meeting with the CM.

86
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,400
Ok Chinnayya. See you later.
- Is there nothing you can do?

87
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,500
No, nothing.

88
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,700
Sir, please dont leave. They
will kill my daughter.

89
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,200
Please sir. I will
fall at your feet.

90
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,900
The home minister is leaving.
Who will rescue my daughter?

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,400
You go and do it.

92
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,200
What me? That Bhadram
will kill me.

93
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
If you are so much afraid
to rescue your daughter..

94
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,900
..then only god can save her.

95
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,400
Hey Venkat!

96
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,400
Tell me, uncle.

97
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,200
Do you know how dangerous
your position is?

98
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,600
Are you looking through
a telescope?

99
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,000
At this stage why are you working
instead of resting at home?

100
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,200
I will bash you if you speak of
my age. Mine is a body of steel.

101
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Okay, attend to your work.

102
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
This boy is becoming
careless day by day.

103
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:06,300
I dont know how to
make him understand.

104
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,500
Venkat, is the work over?

105
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,200
Yes, I fixed all the bombs.

106
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,300
All the 150 bombs will
go off simultaneously.

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,600
Then I shall blow the siren.

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Give me the lunchbox.
Where is uncle?

109
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,600
He must be around. I spoke
to him just a while ago.

110
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,200
I will go and blast the bombs.

111
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,600
Uncle! Uncle!

112
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,800
Why is there no response? Uncle!

113
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,500
Uncle is stuck there.
Turn it off.

114
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,900
That is not possible Venkat.

115
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,800
I have seen the reports.

116
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,300
We must do the bypass
surgery immediately.

117
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,500
Otherwise there will be
a danger to his life.

118
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,900
The surgery will cost about
3lakhs. What are you thinking?

119
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,400
Nothing Sir. You please get
ready for the operation.

120
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,500
I will arrange the money.
One more request sir.

121
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,800
Please do not let Uncle
know about the operation.

122
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,500
Ok.
- Thank you sir.

123
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,400
It seems that your husband has
acquired a lot of fat by eating.

124
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,400
If it is not reduced, the doctors
will remove the heart itself.

125
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,900
Im not afraid of your statements.
I will eat what I want.

126
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
Once you get the reports you
will know what to eat etc.

127
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Till then keep quiet.

128
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,300
My boy, are you sure that there
is no danger to your uncle?

129
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,700
There is no danger. Only a
small operation is required.

130
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,600
An operation?! How
much will it cost?

131
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,900
Why should you worry
about the cost?

132
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
You brought sister and
me up since childhood.

133
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,000
Cant I do this much?

134
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,600
Dont worry. Go and take
care of Uncle. Go now.

135
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,800
Hey boy! Didnt
you recognize me?

136
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,800
I am Seenayya, the producer.

137
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,000
I have some work for you.
Will you come?

138
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,600
You said you have some work.
Why dont you speak?

139
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,600
I am unable to decide
how to tell you.

140
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,800
Dont worry, tell me.

141
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,600
That Badri kidnapped Shailaja.

142
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,600
Is the movie not held
up without completing?

143
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,000
I tried many different things
but could not do it.

144
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,400
Even the home minister
did not help.

145
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,600
You only try something and..

146
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,000
Did you call me just for this?

147
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,800
What can I do if somebody
is kidnapped?

148
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
There is no relation between
Shailu and me.

149
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,400
You only told me that
he is the only

150
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,800
person who can bring her back.

151
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,400
He got angry just on hearing
your daughters name.

152
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,000
Why will he rescue her?

153
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,400
He will bring her back.
My daughter is his life.

154
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,000
He will only bring her back.
- Are you sure? - Yes.

155
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,200
So what have you decided?

156
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,700
I will bring her.

157
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,800
Not because I love her
but since I need money.

158
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,900
Money?!

159
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:34,800
Money is not a problem. Tell
me how much you want.

160
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,300
I will ask after I get her back.

161
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,400
Gave me one cigarette.

162
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,600
Sir, cigarette.

163
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,900
Hey, why are you thundering
like that?

164
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,500
Could you not remember
me all these days?

165
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,600
Anyway, now that you came,
stay here for some time.

166
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,700
The both of us can
play together.

167
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,600
Hey, why are you going
away like that?

168
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,700
What will you lose if you stay
with me for some more time?

169
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,300
Oh God! Did you get wet again?

170
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,800
Take this and dry yourself.

171
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Pandarta?! The train has
no scheduled stop here.

172
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,500
Why did it stop?
- How should I know?

173
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,700
Then why are you sitting there?
Go and find out.

174
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,700
Oh! My ring fell down.

175
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,400
This is a valuable ring. You
should not lose it. Keep it.

176
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,700
This is the ring your father
gave the first time. Keep it.

177
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,400
Bananas! Apples!

178
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,400
Salutations sir.

179
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,500
Why did the train stop?

180
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,400
The water is going
over the tracks.

181
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,400
It may take about two
hours to recede.

182
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,400
Please come and sit in
my room until then.

183
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,400
Idiotic rain!

184
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,400
Hey, ring up uncle and
find out how father is.

185
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
At the same time ask him
to send some vehicles.

186
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,600
We cannot stay here
a long time.

187
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,600
Who is he? - He is Badri,
son of Dasanna.

188
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,600
He has so many people around
him, is he such a big shot?

189
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,300
Keep your voice low, he is the
king of entire Telangana.

190
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,500
Hey, where are you going?
- It is raining, mother.

191
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,600
If your father sees
you, he will..

192
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:09,900
Your husband is busy elsewhere.
Look there.

193
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,200
Silk drops which make
the young girl happy

194
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,200
Like the colorful parrots
and like sugar crystals ..

195
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,700
..the rain drops are falling
to enhance the youth

196
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,200
Did you remember me after
such a long time

197
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,500
How long will you
hide in the skies

198
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,200
You come and go like a guest

199
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:39,200
If you promise to stay
with me forever..

200
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,300
..I will hold you close
with my hands.

201
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:49,600
If you want to come
will I stop you?

202
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:48,200
O beautiful rain drop stay
with me like my nose ring

203
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,400
O beautiful rain drop stay
with me like my ear ring

204
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,200
like my bangles,
and anklets and..

205
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,200
..like ornaments
I wear everyday

206
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:39,600
Shall I preserve you like
a childhood friend?

207
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:46,600
Like the blooming youth of a
girl shall I see myself in you?

208
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,300
Like the song on my lips, like
the poetry of a poet and..

209
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,800
..as the dreams in my eyes
if you wish to be with me

210
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,600
Father is very serious.

211
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:03,900
He wants to see you. Let us go.

212
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,700
Shall I kidnap her?

213
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,400
Find her details.

214
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,400
The train started but
where is your father?

215
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,600
Did father not come?

216
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,600
What are you searching for?

217
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,300
My father did not
board the train.

218
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:54,700
You dont worry. By the way
how does he look like?

219
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,500
How does he look like?

220
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,200
I am asking about
his appearance.

221
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,700
He has a muffler round his
neck and wore kurta pyjama.

222
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,900
Its all right. I will search.

223
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,900
Did you see a person in kurta
pyjama and a muffler.

224
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,400
No sir.

225
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,600
See the other side.

226
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,600
You dont worry. I am asking.

227
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,700
Look that side.

228
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,200
Sir, please wait sir.

229
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,700
Dad! Are you here?

230
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,000
No, I am under the
train. Come on.

231
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,400
Listen, my father is has
boarded the train.

232
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,300
Wait madam, I am searching.

233
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,900
I am saying that my father
is has boarded the train.

234
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,300
I said I am searching.

235
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,700
Why dont you understand?
My father is in the train.

236
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,400
What? He is in the train?

237
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,400
Come soon.

238
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:19,500
O rain, do not go away
after dropping on the eyes.

239
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:28,500
Stay with me always just like
the showers and lightning.

240
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:37,400
Why did you go away having
roused the feeling of love?

241
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:44,200
If you want to come
will I stop you?

242
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
Why are you standing here?

243
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,600
He could not catch the train.

244
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,700
What can you do about
it? Come on.

245
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,400
How is your health, father?

246
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,400
All of you please go out.
I want to talk to my son.

247
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,400
You too, go outside.

248
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,000
Sir!
- Please go.

249
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,500
I understand how it will
be when death comes near.

250
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,500
I know I am not
going to heavens.

251
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,500
Being a gangster I killed many
people and now I am suffering.

252
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,500
You dont repeat my mistakes.

253
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,800
And dont ever hurt any woman.
I did that with Parvati.

254
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:21,600
I never told anybody that I am
the father of her son Kasi.

255
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,200
Now I want to do justice to him.

256
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:29,500
I want to give half of
my property to her son.

257
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Promise me you will
fulfill my wish.

258
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,000
Why dont you talk?
Will you do it?

259
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,300
Do you equate me with the
son of your mistress ?

260
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,200
Your dad is very great.

261
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:23,400
He lived and died like a king.

262
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,500
He died like a dog.

263
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,500
I became home minister
because of your father.

264
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,300
From now I will serve you as
I used to serve your father.

265
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,200
I know I will have your support.

266
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,300
Just a phone call is
enough for any work.

267
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,400
By the way 17 of our people
are in central jail.

268
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,400
If you ever need them I will
release then on parole.

269
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,200
I have an urgent meeting
with collector. Bye.

270
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,400
You stay here.

271
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,900
She is the your fathers
mistress and he is her son.

272
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:21,700
Mother, he is my brother and
he will be with me from now.

273
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,700
Come let us pray
for our father soul.

274
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,700
You made him a permanent
servant by calling him brother.

275
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,700
Gun, How much?
- One liter.

276
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,900
Only single, why dont
you take two liters.

277
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:57,300
I dont have money.

278
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,500
What is the need for
money between us?

279
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,800
Hey, prepare the bill
for one liter.

280
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,200
If you give 2 liters I will
prepare the bill for 2 liters.

281
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,800
Shall I give you two slaps?.
What we want is ladies.

282
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,700
Then fill the tank. Anyway
it is not your money.

283
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,300
If I fill the tank she will
not come until next week.

284
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,400
If I fill 2 liters she will
be back tomorrow morning.

285
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,600
What happened madam?

286
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,200
You are not coming so
frequently. Did you forget me?

287
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,700
I remembered you the
day before yesterday.

288
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,300
What about yesterday?

289
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,800
I didnt go to zoo yesterday.

290
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,400
Personal. Hey venki,
Venkat is here.

291
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,700
All of you come here.
Venkat arrived.

292
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,700
Hey, move of the way. Always
blocking the way.

293
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,900
Why are you shouting at her?

294
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,400
This is a routine matter for us.
- First tell me why are you here?

295
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,500
What about your interview?
- Its gone.

296
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,900
Wow, it is gone.

297
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,600
What is this?

298
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,600
I missed the opportunity.

299
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,400
Is she that beautiful?

300
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,600
Who may be the blessed person
that gave birth to..

301
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,900
..such a beauty?! She is from
the abode of the gods.

302
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,600
Give me 2 liters.

303
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Wait for 5 minutes. We are
in important discussion.

304
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,400
You came without knowing the
name or address of the girl?

305
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,700
I could not find.
- Why was that happened?

306
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,200
What will you do here
without those details?

307
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,400
That is the issue I
am unable to solve.

308
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,600
Nothing is there to solve.
Just forget about her.

309
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,400
Why do you discourage him
like that? Encourage him.

310
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,800
Look here my dear Salim
- My name is Venkat.

311
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,000
No. If you are searching for
your Anarkali then you are Salim.

312
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,600
You look so dynamic.
Why are you..

313
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
..listening to this
burnt out fellow?

314
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,700
Thats it. Look here, dont be
depressed that you missed her.

315
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:38,000
Search! - There is nothing you
cannot find if you search.

316
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,400
Who are you sir, giving
advice freely?

317
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,300
Ranga Rao, a big name in the
states. I came here now.

318
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,400
I am planning to settle
down in Warangal.

319
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,000
Thinking to settle in Warangal?

320
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,600
Do you know what lemons
called in Warangal?

321
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
What are they called?
- They are called Lemons.

322
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,900
That is what is called extra
speech. Pour 2 litres. - Ok.

323
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,000
My boy, where is the club
for playing cards?

324
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,400
Search! There is nothing you
cannot find by searching.

325
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,700
I did not like your face.

326
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Did I like yours?
Am I not adjusting?

327
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,700
How much did it cost?
- Sixty-eight.

328
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,200
How much?
- Sixty-Eight.

329
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,900
Is it sixty-eight? I have
sixty. Keep the change.

330
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,900
Ah! He gave 8 rupees less and
asking me to keep the change?!

331
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,900
Ah! What a son in law!

332
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,400
He is making my daughters
shift from place to place.

333
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:36,900
He plays cards, has debts every
where and has got us a bad name.

334
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:42,000
Grandmother! We all know about
father. Leave the matter.

335
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,700
All these days she supported
him. Now you are doing that?

336
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,600
He left us at home with
out any care and..

337
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
.. now we dont know
in which club or ..

338
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,000
..under which tree he
is playing cards.

339
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:58,900
I am here! What aunty? You
are praising me a lot?

340
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,300
The state is facing a drought.
People have stopped giving loans.

341
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,900
And they are unjustly asking
me to repay their money too.

342
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,900
Since there was no one else
I came back thinking that..

343
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,400
..my mother in law is my
only refuge. Am I wrong?

344
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,000
You will always do this.

345
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,600
Do you know that you have
a marriageable daughter?

346
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,900
First address that issue.

347
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,700
Ha! Ha! My daughter
is a princess.

348
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:20,400
Some prince will definitely
come for her.

349
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:24,900
He will give me half of his
kingdom as dowry to marry her.

350
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,400
This is ancient tradition
and is not wrong.

351
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,300
My dear, I know that you made
fish curry. Serve it to me.

352
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,600
What happened?

353
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,000
Boss, the girl is here,
in Warangal.

354
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,700
Hey, cant you see what is
happening? Cant you wait?

355
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,700
You continue speaking.

356
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,400
Her father is a useless man.

357
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Throughout the day he
indulges in drink..

358
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,600
..playing cards and spends
all his time at the club.

359
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,700
There is no habit
he doesnt have.

360
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,000
It will be very easy
to manage him.

361
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:17,000
Uncle, for the first
time in my life

362
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,800
I had the desire for marriage.

363
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:22,000
And that was after seeing her.
Handle this case carefully.

364
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,600
Give the money.
- How much?

365
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,400
10 rupees. Bring this bag also.
- I am already carrying two bags.

366
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,800
Why dont you give it
to brother-in-law?

367
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,600
He is already carrying the
burden of the family.

368
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,900
You bring it.
- I will bring it.

369
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Have you understood, uncle?

370
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,800
They say I am not securing
marks and you dont have job.

371
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,400
Sister, where are you going?

372
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,900
Those brinjals are fresh. You
wait here. - Is it necessary?

373
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,700
What happened to these people?

374
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,400
Uncle!
- What is it?

375
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,500
Do you like that girl?

376
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,900
I have told you about a girl, Do
you remember? She is the girl.

377
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,500
Who? That train beauty?

378
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
Yes. Will you do a
favor to me please?

379
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,900
Take your parents out from here.

380
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,400
Ok, I will do that. Will
you buy me a chocolate?

381
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,900
I will give you as
many as you want.

382
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,900
Mom!
- What happened?

383
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,400
Mom, the chips which you
kept out for drying..

384
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,800
..will be spoiled in this rain.

385
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,300
Sister, Why are you
still standing here?

386
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,200
You first go home.
- Let us go home.

387
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:23,400
Ok, come on let us go.

388
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,600
Is that you?
- You remember me?

389
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,600
Yes, are you from Warnagal?

390
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,700
No madam, I am from Vijayawada.

391
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,000
I came to Warangal to
purchase vegetables.

392
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,300
My name is Venkat. I studied
polytechnic. Height 62.

393
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,900
Please tell me your name,
address and other details.

394
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,500
Is it so urgent?

395
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,700
I dont want to miss again.

396
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,800
I am very sorry. That day
my father was in toilet.

397
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,200
With out knowing that I.

398
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,400
Leave that matter. You
must be tired by now.

399
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:19,400
You are dancing till now from
the moment we met, in my dreams.

400
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,500
I have to take you to
my friends immediately.

401
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,300
That Jagan argues that no one
is beautiful than Aiswarya.

402
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,900
He will shut his mouth
if he sees you once.

403
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,900
Are you trying to impress me?

404
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,400
No madam. I have already
impressed you.

405
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,400
I think you like the
rain very much.

406
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,600
Rain is my friend.

407
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,600
Correct madam. It rained
when we first met.

408
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,700
It is raining today also.

409
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,400
That means you friend rain
is trying to unite us..

410
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,900
..which means there is
something between us.

411
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:00,500
I dont think so. It is raining
since this is the rainy season.

412
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,900
I remember from the rain. I will
show you a beautiful place. Come

413
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,300
Where to?

414
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,900
To the temple of
thousand pillars.

415
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,400
It will be wonderful experience
to see it when it is raining.

416
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,500
With two temples on either
side of nandi ..

417
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,600
..and a rainbow starting from
one temple ends on the other.

418
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,700
You have to see it definitely.

419
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,900
Really? Will it be so nice?

420
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,900
You should see yourself to
believe. Come on let us go. - Now?

421
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,400
It can be seen only
when it is raining.

422
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,700
Believe me. Please come once.

423
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,600
It stopped to rain. Bye.

424
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:33,900
Where are you going?

425
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,300
Should I tell you?

426
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:38,700
At least tell me when
will we meet again.

427
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,600
Let us see when it again rains.

428
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,400
What is that?

429
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:47,400
Didnt you tell that the
rain is uniting us?

430
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,400
If we meet when
it again rains..

431
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,800
..I will also believe that there
is something between us. Bye.

432
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,300
You will meet again when it
rains? I dont understand a bit.

433
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,800
Do you at least know his name?

434
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,300
What is there in the name,
Grandmother?

435
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,900
He is tall handsome guy.
Is it not enough?

436
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,700
I am not able to understand you.

437
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,200
Mother, is it proper to teach
her all this things?

438
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,400
You shut up. The society
has changed.

439
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,600
You are an old woman by birth.

440
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,900
Do you think he will
meet you again?

441
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,400
My friend rain will take care
of that. It will unite us.

442
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,400
None of the cards are useful.

443
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:33,400
When you dont have
luck how can you win?

444
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,900
Show.
- What? - Show.

445
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,600
My score is 60. What about you?

446
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,200
50. - What about you?
- Ten.

447
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:46,400
What is this? Are you
trying to cheat us?

448
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Do you know, here people will
bash you if you try to cheat.

449
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,700
Is it new for me? Just joking.

450
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,300
Distribute once again. I will
have the show and pay you.

451
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,500
Are you trying to fool
us? Give the money.

452
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,700
I dont have any. I have given
all of them to you only.

453
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:03,200
Dont try to scare me.
I will not be scared?

454
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,700
Nothing is left with me. I
dont have watch or chain.

455
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,300
What will you do?
Bash me? Do it.

456
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,700
Continue the game.

457
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,400
Who are you, sir?

458
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,900
He is Badris man.

459
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,500
Why are you giving me
the money? - Play.

460
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,500
You please play, sir.

461
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,900
I dont know how to
play? You play.

462
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,400
We can settle terms later.
There is a bar nearby.

463
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,400
Come there after you
finished the game.

464
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,700
When does it rain?

465
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,900
When black clouds appear.

466
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,700
When does the black
clouds appear?

467
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,700
Just before the rain comes.

468
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,700
You idiot!

469
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,700
I can tell you when the
petrol tanker will come..

470
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
..but how could you expect me
to know when it will rain.

471
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,700
Not only me, nobody
can tell you that.

472
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,600
I can tell.
- Tell what?

473
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,000
What is the program
on TV at 7 p.m.?

474
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,000
A serial named Jeevanarogalu.

475
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
After that?
- We will get headache.

476
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,400
After that?
- News will come.

477
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,600
After that?
- Weather report.

478
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,800
Who will give that report?

479
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:15,600
Gali Ganna Rao. If we call him
he can tell when it will rain.

480
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:24,000
9848032919. This is
my cell number.

481
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,400
Gali Ganna Rao. This is my name.

482
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,600
People always misunderstand
me and feel..

483
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,900
..that I give them
wrong information.

484
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,400
I only read the report given
by the weather department..

485
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,400
..but dont control
the weather myself.

486
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,600
It will be good if you
understand that.

487
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,600
Please call later. Ok? Catch!

488
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,300
Sir, we are in trouble.

489
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,800
We did not still get
the report which..

490
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,300
..we are supposed to get by
now. - What shall we do?

491
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,400
Oh! I see that you are new to
the job. You dont know about me.

492
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,500
Do you think that we depend
fully on their report?

493
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Now select one finger.
The pointing finger?

494
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,400
There will be no rain. Go.

495
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,600
Sir, there is a phone for you.

496
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,200
Who is that?
- A fan of yours.

497
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,200
This is Gali Ganna Rao speaking.

498
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,600
This is Gun the Gagan speaking.

499
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,600
Are you the person who gives
the weather-related news?

500
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,200
How does he know?
Yes. What you want?

501
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,400
When can we expect the rain?

502
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,700
Not at present.
- Why?

503
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,600
Because the pointing
finger was selected.

504
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,700
Tell me correctly.

505
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,400
During the next 48 hours the
state will not have any rainfall.

506
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,400
You can dry clothes, dry
chips under the sun etc.

507
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,600
Can we apply beer to the hair?

508
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,900
Do whatever you want
and leave me.

509
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,400
Will there be rain at
least after 48 hours?

510
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,400
This is a difficult question.
Wait a minute. Select one finger.

511
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,600
Yes. There will be rain after
48 hrs, 6 minutes and 8 seconds.

512
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,800
Is the rain guaranteed?

513
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Yes, without doubt. My
finger never cheats me.

514
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:37,600
Since you asked so many
foolish questions..

515
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,700
..can I ask you just one?
- Go ahead.

516
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,700
You are inquiring so
much about the rain..

517
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,900
.what seeds did you sow?

518
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,800
He is asking what
seeds we sowed?

519
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,300
Tell him that it is the seed
of love. - The seed of love.

520
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,400
What? The seed of love?!

521
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,300
Put the phone down. Hey guys,
it will rain after 48 hours.

522
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:54,400
We all heard that.

523
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,200
These people will
be like this only.

524
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,900
What a big house this is?!

525
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,700
You have seen only the outside.
Now see the inside.

526
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:07,900
It will be great.

527
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
What is this?

528
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:13,400
I am afraid of dogs, sir.

529
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,600
Thieves must be afraid of dogs.
Why should you be?

530
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,800
That is why I am afraid.

531
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,900
He is counting notes
by the heap.

532
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,400
The boss is coming.

533
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:32,900
Boss, this mans name is Kona
Ranga Rao. A good friend of mine.

534
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,800
He came to seek your help.

535
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,400
Dont be afraid. A blood
relation started between us.

536
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,400
Ask him.

537
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:59,400
Sir, I tried various businesses
in different parts of the state.

538
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:02,400
I also tried different
precious stones.

539
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,600
When I was that my fate would
never change, I met you.

540
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:07,300
Ask him a loan.

541
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,900
Sir, I need some financial
assistance from you.

542
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:13,600
Uncle!

543
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:23,300
The God has granted the wish
but the priest created hurdles.

544
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Take this.

545
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,500
Sir, you helped me
as soon as I asked.

546
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,600
If you please visit
my home for dinner..

547
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,700
.. I will repay your kindness.

548
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,700
Hey, why will he come to your
house? Stay within your limits.

549
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,800
Uncle, he made the request
himself. I will consider later.

550
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,800
SIR I felt like..

551
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,400
Hey, you are starting a song
when you are asked for a story.

552
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
You got your money. Now leave.

553
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,900
What did he see in me
to lend me this money?

554
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,400
If he gave you money
without a mortgage..

555
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,400
..then you must have something
as valuable as gold.

556
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,500
What do I have? I have
a golden heart.

557
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:01,500
Gali Ganna Rao speaking.

558
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,900
Where is the rain?

559
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,400
We dont have rain in stock.
It is out of stock.

560
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,900
How can rain the out of stock,
you fool! You idiot!

561
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,400
Everyone calls me a fool.
But you have..

562
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,600
..lovingly called me and
idiot. Who are you?

563
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:15,400
You said that there would
be rain after 48 hours..

564
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,400
.. six minutes and
eight seconds.

565
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,700
Where is the rain?

566
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,900
Is it you, seed of love?

567
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,400
Rain is not a wife to come
as soon as it is called.

568
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,500
Of course, my wife does not
come even when I call her.

569
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,600
Then whose call will
she respond to?

570
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,200
Are you talking about
the rain or my wife?

571
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,500
At present we are talking
about your wife..

572
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,700
..tell me about the rain.

573
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,200
The rain was supposed to come.
But the low pressure..

574
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,900
..crossed Orissa, West Bengal
and then moved over to Bangladesh.

575
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,600
Then what are you doing here
without going to Bangladesh.

576
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,200
I do not have a passport.

577
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:41,500
What passport, you
anthrax......!

578
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,600
My boy, you are inventing
new words to swear at me.

579
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,200
If you hang up, I will
resign his job..

580
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,600
.. and become a wayside
astrologer.

581
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,600
You are not fit even for that.

582
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,400
O God of rains! Till
today I thought..

583
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,500
.. that only farmers
pray to you.

584
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,600
But now even lovers
are praying to you.

585
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:00,900
Dont you have mercy,
O God of rains!

586
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,400
The moment we hung up there
is thunder and lightning.

587
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,900
This means that there
will be rain.

588
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,400
Hurray! It is raining.

589
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Hey, stop. She said that she
will meet when it rains..

590
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:21,600
..but did not tell
when and where.

591
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,700
I am getting tense and cannot
understand what to do.

592
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:28,600
It is me who should understand.
Why are you overacting?

593
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,300
Shut your mouth. I
know where to go.

594
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,400
Grandmother! Did I not tell
you? The rain is here.

595
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:38,400
Yes I see that. Leave me. What
is the use of holding my hands?

596
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:42,400
Go and hold the hands of that
boy. Where will you meet him?

597
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:46,600
You did not even decide on a
place to meet. I dont understand.

598
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:50,400
It is me who has to understand.
Not you.

599
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,800
I understood completely.
I will leave now. Bye.

600
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,400
Who are you?

601
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,400
Why are you standing there
and blocking the entrance?

602
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,700
Please come in sir.

603
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,500
Please have this seat sir.

604
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,900
This is the house of a poor
man, built with a lot of effort.

605
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:25,500
Come here, he is Badri,
a very famous man.

606
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,900
He has a very big heart. He
is the king of Telangana.

607
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:31,700
He does not go to anyones
home. He visited only ours.

608
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:36,000
She is Shailaja, my daughter.

609
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,000
Will you get some coffee,
my dear?

610
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:44,000
She is learning dance.

611
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,000
He brought that rowdy with him.
One scoundrel joined another.

612
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,000
You leave quickly.

613
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,700
What about the coffee?

614
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:55,300
I will take care of all
that. You leave now.

615
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,800
Otherwise you may
not meet that guy.

616
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,400
Why did the young girl
become an old woman?

617
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,400
Sir, coffee! Please take it.

618
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:19,500
She is my mother in law. But
she is more than my mother.

619
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:21,700
Then why do you make
her serve the coffee?

620
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,800
You should have asked
your child to do it.

621
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,600
She went to the temple
for her prayer.

622
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,900
She should have gone
after an hour.

623
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,700
After an hour the priests will
close the temple and leave.

624
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,900
My child has a lot of
devotion for God.

625
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,500
There is a temple on the
side and that side too.

626
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,700
There is also a beautiful
rainbow in between.

627
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,900
Everything is just as he said.

628
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,800
But where is he? He
is not to be seen.

629
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:57,300
Hey rain, are you pouring
down only here..

630
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,300
..or even at the place
where he is?

631
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,300
If you do so then he will
think there is no rain..

632
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:06,900
.. and will not come.

633
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:10,700
Why dont you please rain
at his place too?

634
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:18,200
My dear, my cute rain! Please
rain at his place also.

635
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:35,500
Do you believe at least now
that rain unites both of us?

636
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:39,900
I already believe that.

637
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,400
It seems you did not
believe completely.

638
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:47,900
Because you came so close
but stayed that far.

639
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:16,600
Let the distance between
the hearts melt slowly

640
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,200
Let me slowly open the door
of naughty thoughts

641
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:28,300
The sky is sending down
rain threads of love

642
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:33,900
And making a garland with
rain drops as flowers

643
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,300
At this pleasant moment
when it drenched us ..

644
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:41,600
.. and joined us by
the rainbow of love

645
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,300
With this rain as a witness..

646
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,300
.. let me proclaim
that you are mine

647
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,300
With this rain as a witness..

648
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,200
.. let me establish
this bond forever.

649
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:34,500
In your twists and turns I can
see the beauty of lightning

650
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,600
I am seeing your spectacular
dance in this first rain

651
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,500
I can hear your voice
in this thunder

652
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,300
And do I hear your
signals through..

653
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,300
..the sounds of
these rain drops

654
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:57,300
I am following the
track of your heart

655
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:02,200
Shall I follow your foot
steps as your wife

656
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:14,400
In this wetness when
your shyness went away

657
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,200
Can any curtain stop
your eagerness

658
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:14,800
I am gifting my beauty
to your eyes

659
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:20,200
Let these rain drops
show me your treasures

660
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,200
And let me remain indebted
to the god of rain

661
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:32,200
I cannot stop the anxious
youth anymore

662
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:38,300
Shall we marry with
out any delay

663
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:41,300
let us recreate history
and show that..

664
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,300
..our union is a proof
of real friendship

665
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,400
I will never remove
you from my heart .

666
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,400
..and this ring from my finger.

667
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:04,400
You should also promise
me one thing.

668
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:09,900
Whenever it rains you should
come and hug me like this.

669
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,500
My God! From where did
you get that heroine?

670
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,700
Shall we watch the shooting?

671
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,500
Why not? Let us go.

672
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,300
Sir, see this girl!
How beautiful she is!

673
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,400
If we make her the heroine
in our movie..

674
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,000
..it will definitely go on to
celebrate a silver jublee.

675
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,400
You are right director.
She looks wonderful.

676
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,600
Hey photographer!
Take a few snaps ..

677
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,800
..of that girl in
the pink dress.

678
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,600
Look here Mr.Ranga Rao!

679
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,400
We never know when luck
will smile on someone.

680
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,600
For example Simran
became a heroine.

681
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:49,800
Her mother is moving
around in a Benz car.

682
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,300
Roja also became a heroine. -
Her brother too has a Benz car.

683
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Same thing with Rambha too.

684
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,700
Her mother is moving
around in Benz car.

685
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,400
You are talking only about
brothers and mothers.

686
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:01,900
What about fathers?
- He is there.

687
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,300
And you are that
person if you agree.

688
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,200
Listen to me and make
your daughter a heroine..

689
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,200
..then you will get
not only Benz cars ..

690
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,500
..but you can enjoy
all other luxuries.

691
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:15,200
You can earn some
crores of money.

692
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,400
Crores!?

693
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,200
Yes believe me.

694
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,200
Kona Ranga Rao becomes
crores Ranga Rao.

695
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:24,500
I am placing my
daughter in your hands..

696
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:27,200
..you should make her a star
and change my fate.

697
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,200
Do you have a five star cigarette?

698
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,700
Dont say anything else.
My stomach is about to split.

699
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:41,700
Yes, my difficulties have
become a joke for you.

700
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,400
Tell as what they are.

701
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,600
There are two matches. One
girl is very beautiful.

702
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,200
She likes me too. But she
does not have any money.

703
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,600
The other girl is
average in looks.

704
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,200
But she is very wealthy

705
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,900
What is there in money?

706
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:57,500
You are lucky to find
a girl who likes you.

707
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,200
Marry that girl who is not
rich and you will be happy.

708
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,500
You are what I call a friend.

709
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,200
Now tell me the address
of that which girl.

710
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,300
Give me water!

711
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:18,300
Someone close to you
is remembering you.

712
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,300
Why do they remember even
when they are close?

713
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:25,300
Because they are close,
they will remember..

714
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,400
..either when close
by or when far away.

715
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,200
Is that so?

716
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,900
Hey, these people are
getting very close.

717
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,900
It is better that we go away.

718
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,500
Hey, Mr.Ranga Rao!

719
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,500
Oh! My father!

720
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,500
Where is your father?

721
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,500
There. Near that scooter.
- Is that man your father?

722
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,600
Hey! Do something.

723
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,600
Build a wall.

724
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:51,200
Do you know my father?
- Yes we know.

725
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,200
Hey, Salim!

726
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:55,700
He is coming this side. There
is an auto coming behind.

727
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,800
Stop the auto.

728
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,200
Take it and go.

729
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,500
Will the meter work?

730
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,700
It will cost 5 rupees
more than the meter.

731
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:06,900
Ok bye. Good night.

732
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:09,600
Did she go?
- Hello Salim, how are you?

733
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,400
Hello, Mr. Ranga Rao!
Are you fine?

734
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,500
Do we look like thieves
who steal rings?

735
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:20,500
No. Because we sell the rings
before you can steal them.

736
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,400
Did you get your Anarkali?

737
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,900
Yes sir, by your grace?

738
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,600
So are you daily going to the
movies and parks with her?

739
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,500
Even that happened just
now with your grace.

740
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,200
When is the marriage?

741
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,500
That too will depend
on your grace.

742
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,200
That is, should the girls
father not agree?

743
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,900
Why should you worry about
the girls father?

744
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,500
I advise you to elope
with the girl.

745
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:40,600
That will fix the father and
you will enjoy the thrill.

746
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,700
Sir, do you know what
your greatness is?

747
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,500
What is it?
- I too dont know.

748
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:48,400
That is what I call extra
speech. I did not like your face.

749
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,700
Salim, the scooter is
not getting started.

750
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,900
Please kick start it.

751
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,200
If he likes someones
face he will make..

752
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:02,300
Why does he have Shailus
ring on his finger?

753
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:10,600
I had a similar ring
made for my daughter.

754
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,500
She lost it somewhere.

755
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:16,400
Did you find it by any chance?

756
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,300
I was joking.

757
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,200
This is a girls ring.
Not good for you.

758
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,700
Your luck will be reversed.
Take it off.

759
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,600
Oh, is it love! You must
have that much passion.

760
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,200
But be careful. If
that father knows..

761
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,800
..he might have your
hand or leg removed.

762
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:39,800
His head will be
removed before..

763
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:42,200
..he decides between
hand or leg.

764
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:48,800
His Anarkali is my daughter?!

765
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,200
Then why will she agree
to become an actress?

766
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,300
She will not.

767
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,200
All of you come here.
Listen all of you.

768
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:04,400
If all my debts have
to be repaid..

769
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,900
..and if you have to breath
free air, then I must die.

770
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,600
Oh God! Im coming to you.

771
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,300
How are you? Bring some water.

772
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,500
What? Am I not dead?

773
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:27,600
You may stop me today
and tomorrow.

774
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:32,300
But I will go one day. No
one listens to what I say.

775
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,300
I will listen to you.

776
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,800
Swear by your mother that
you will listen to me.

777
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,800
Okay I will listen to you.

778
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:51,300
Will you become
a cinema actress?

779
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,600
No, no. You must pose like this.

780
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,600
Are you a director?

781
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:16,500
You are shooting a photograph
like a movie.

782
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:20,200
My money is hard earned..

783
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:23,400
Excuse me. No smoking sir.

784
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,600
I am the father of the heroine.

785
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:28,600
Even then you cannot smoke sir.

786
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:31,500
Let the movie succeed, then
I will take care of you.

787
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,300
Hi, Salim! What are
you doing here?

788
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:56,500
I came for Anarkali.

789
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,200
Where is your Anarakali?

790
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,200
Dont play games. Then give
your daughter to me.

791
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:05,200
I will look after her very well.

792
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:15,300
I dont even know your name.
My daughter is a star.

793
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,900
She will be a heroine.

794
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,900
She cannot be the lover
of a loafer like you.

795
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,700
There is a lot of gap between
you and my daughter.

796
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:26,400
Hey, you cannot even
touch her shadow.

797
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:30,600
What? - You cannot even
touch her shadow.

798
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:20,200
You said I cant even
touch her shadow?

799
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:24,300
I am going to marry Shailu.
Venkat weds Shailaja.

800
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:29,600
If anybody try to obstruct
Venkat kills anybody.

801
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,500
I like you O Nijam girl
and you are my princess

802
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:20,900
Welcome my dear prince and
take this young beauty with you

803
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,200
If you give me your
hand I will take..

804
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:38,400
..you atop the elephant with me

805
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,500
Arrange for the musical
band for our marriage.

806
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,900
I will come with you

807
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,400
This girl has eagerly
accepted my proposal

808
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,500
Let us come together
and steal each others hearts

809
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,700
Talk sweetly and open the
treasure of my beauty

810
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:27,400
You too became intelligent

811
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,800
Because you pampered me

812
01:05:33,700 --> 01:05:37,900
I laid a path of jasmines for
you. Come to me running

813
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:42,300
I heart found the priest of
love and could not escape from him

814
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,200
Be the deity in the
temple of my heart

815
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,200
I am intoxicated with your
love and come to you

816
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:37,600
I will blow away with
you like a gale

817
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:40,200
My shyness became an hurdle

818
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,200
I will drive it away
by kissing your cheek

819
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,400
Drown me with your kisses and
lift me in your embrace

820
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:54,200
Become the beautiful day once
and a lovely night once

821
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:58,800
We must be exited each
time we embrace

822
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,300
I lost all my prestige.

823
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:36,200
When he was kissing you
in front of your father..

824
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,700
..and everybody, you didnt
say a single word.

825
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,700
She is being ecstatic about it.

826
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,400
You took an oath
by your mother..

827
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:51,700
..does he became important
than her?

828
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:57,700
I took oath of mom that I will
act in movies not to forget him.

829
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:03,200
It is unnecessary for
me to live any more.

830
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,300
O dear, keep that pan aside.

831
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:06,800
I will burn myself into ashes.

832
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,200
Will you keep it aside
if I tell you?

833
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:13,300
Have you not told me to do so?
- Let us go out.

834
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:15,300
It seems son-in-law is
going to do something.

835
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,400
Let us not disturb him. Come on.

836
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,200
O my dear, is it ok
for you if I die?

837
01:08:27,700 --> 01:08:35,200
It is burning! Where there
is a will there is a way.

838
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,700
Bhadra, Ranga Rao
came to see you.

839
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,800
Let him in.
- Hey you, come here.

840
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:57,400
Sir, Bhadram sir!
You are my God.

841
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,200
Please save my daughter and me.

842
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:03,300
She is my only daughter and
I brought her up as a doll.

843
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,700
Even my master is also
looking her as a doll..

844
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:15,200
..but he wants to see
her in his home.

845
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,400
He is ready to give 10 lakhs
if you accept this marriage.

846
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,500
When crores are coming
who needs lakhs.

847
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,200
I will first use him to finish
Venkat, then think this matter.

848
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:27,200
My God, 10 lakhs?
Where are they?

849
01:09:27,300 --> 01:09:29,200
Here, take them.

850
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:35,200
Sir, God has given me an extra
tooth but not extra intelligence.

851
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:38,200
I would have realized your
heart if He gave me that.

852
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,400
But I am unfortunate.

853
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,300
This marriage will not happen.

854
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:44,200
Why is that?

855
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:46,200
Every idiot wants to
marry my daughter..

856
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:47,700
..Sir, I am not talking
about him.

857
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,200
He is pure gold, I am talking
about that fellow..

858
01:09:50,300 --> 01:09:52,700
..who trapped my daughter
in the name of love.

859
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,900
Who is he?

860
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,200
His name is Venkat.

861
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,900
He is handsome and 6 feet tall.
That is the main problem.

862
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,600
Thank you.

863
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,400
Do you want another?
- It is enough for now.

864
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:18,900
Are you Venkat?

865
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:20,600
Yes.

866
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,200
Boss is calling you. Get in
to the jeep. - Which boss?

867
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,700
This territory has only
one boss. Bhadram sir.

868
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:32,800
Why does he wants me?

869
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,300
Hey! He got some work. Shut
up and get in to the jeep.

870
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,300
The boy is with me. You go.

871
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,300
I will drop him at the
house and follow you.

872
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:43,600
Who is he? He is talking
opposite to what we say.

873
01:10:43,700 --> 01:10:45,500
Put both of them in the jeep.

874
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,700
Come on.

875
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:56,700
What is this? Why are
you so angry with us?

876
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:02,500
Sorry sir. I said I will come.
Please leave the boy.

877
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,400
I would not cause any
harm just caress him.

878
01:11:12,500 --> 01:11:16,200
Take the boy home.
Dont you hear? Go.

879
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,700
He seems to be mad.

880
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:51,300
Hold on. Are you scared?
Come on.

881
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,600
Please give back the kid.

882
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,300
Why are you crying my boy?
Will you go to your uncle?

883
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,600
Banti!?

884
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:28,400
Please give the boy.

885
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:56,400
Hey! Your uncle saw you.

886
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:58,400
The kid is very smart. Catch.

887
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:25,700
You took a nice catch.

888
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,400
Open the door.

889
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,400
Uncle!

890
01:16:37,900 --> 01:16:41,200
Dont show your face to
me. Get out. - Boss!

891
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,300
I say get out.

892
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,200
Uncle.

893
01:16:51,300 --> 01:16:54,700
You just beat them. I would
have cut them into pieces.

894
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,200
Do you know I am from Cuddupah.
I am a tiger.

895
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,200
Hey! Take out the rods
let us bash them all.

896
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,500
Here, take this rod
and bash them all.

897
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,600
I swore to Sai Baba that I
dont hit anybody on Thursday.

898
01:17:16,200 --> 01:17:20,200
Bhadra, may be the person
sitting is the one we want.

899
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:21,400
I will talk to him.

900
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,400
My boss called you.
You rejected.

901
01:17:33,200 --> 01:17:35,900
So he himself came here. Why
are you sitting without respect?

902
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:53,600
I am the person who beat your
people. It was not my mistake.

903
01:17:53,700 --> 01:17:56,200
You called me. I said
I will come..

904
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,800
..after dropping
the boy at home.

905
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:02,200
They tried to hurt the
boy. I will kill..

906
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:05,700
..the person who tries
to hurt the boy.

907
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,500
Uncle!

908
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:13,200
Look here, I am an elderly
person advising you.

909
01:18:13,300 --> 01:18:15,200
Obey my words and
forget that girl.

910
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:18,200
Which girl?
- What was her name? Shailaja.

911
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,300
Shailu!? Why should
I forget her?

912
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,300
Because my boss is loving her.

913
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,700
Hey, You will not
be in Warangal.

914
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,300
In that case I will
stay in Karim Nagar.

915
01:18:31,200 --> 01:18:35,200
Tell me uncle, he is loving
her but does she love him?

916
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:39,500
Who needs that? My boss loves
her. That is enough.

917
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:43,200
It is not enough uncle.
Your boss is loving her.

918
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:49,400
I am loving her. She loves
me. So she is mine.

919
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:53,200
I am an young guy asking you.
Please leave this place.

920
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,400
Shailu is mine.
