1
00:02:21,729 --> 00:02:22,937
-Dhanaselvam.
-Sir?

2
00:02:23,187 --> 00:02:26,021
Did you seize any weapons
or assets from him?

3
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:30,312
No weapons, sir. We've taken
only his phone, ID and a wallet.

4
00:02:30,687 --> 00:02:32,854
Is there any link between
the victim Thambidurai and...

5
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:35,521
Oh! Is that him?

6
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:40,979
-Any past enmity with the victim?
-Nothing as per our investigation.

7
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:44,062
Since the victim is a big shot,
there's a lot of pressure.

8
00:02:44,146 --> 00:02:47,271
I know! I've doubled my
blood pressure pills.

9
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:51,687
<i>Sir, Deputy Commissioner is coming.</i>
<i>Over!</i>

10
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:58,312
-David, didn't you go to a hospital?
-Tomorrow, sir.

11
00:02:58,562 --> 00:03:01,896
Take rest.
I'll call you if needed.

12
00:03:04,021 --> 00:03:05,396
Has he said anything yet?

13
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,854
Being an auspicious day,
he says he's observing silence.

14
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:10,396
That's rich.
Commits a murder and then acts pious!

15
00:03:10,729 --> 00:03:13,354
-You're going along with this?
-He wanted the whole night, sir.

16
00:03:13,604 --> 00:03:15,146
They've given him just an hour.

17
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,562
Ten minutes to go, sir.

18
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,771
-When did you pick him?
-Around 3:30 p.m., sir.

19
00:03:21,062 --> 00:03:23,604
He came to fetch his son
from the school.

20
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:25,812
-Who? Is that the boy sitting outside?
-Yes, sir.

21
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:26,812
Yes, sir.

22
00:03:26,896 --> 00:03:30,104
-Has he eaten yet?
-Rosie must've given him something.

23
00:03:30,271 --> 00:03:31,771
Saami, when will you go on
your pilgrimage?

24
00:03:31,896 --> 00:03:33,271
Right after we crack this case.

25
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:35,479
We've got a mail from
the Human Rights Commission.

26
00:03:35,687 --> 00:03:36,687
-What is it?
-Nothing.

27
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:38,646
They've asked us to conduct
a humane investigation...

28
00:03:38,729 --> 00:03:40,521
Oh! He's such a big shot, eh?

29
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,437
-Hey! Masilamani!
-Hmm?

30
00:03:43,854 --> 00:03:45,354
You don't have to talk.

31
00:03:45,646 --> 00:03:48,729
Don't waste time and just write down
how you committed the murder.

32
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,937
Give him a paper.

33
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:52,687
Here.

34
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:01,646
Use this to write.

35
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,354
-Thilaka, I'm at work. Tell me.
<i>-Got a minute?</i>

36
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:35,979
-Is our daughter back from her tuition?
<i>-Yes.</i>

37
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:37,979
<i>Will you be home for dinner?</i>

38
00:04:38,646 --> 00:04:41,812
I might be a bit late.
Could you send some with the driver?

39
00:04:42,104 --> 00:04:44,687
<i>-How many people?</i>
-For 3-4 people.

40
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:47,729
-Vegetarian for Saami.
<i>-Sure thing. I'll send it.</i>

41
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:59,479
<i>I didn't know what else to do.</i>

42
00:05:01,437 --> 00:05:04,021
<i>It's with a heavy heart that I...</i>

43
00:05:20,812 --> 00:05:22,146
Is the paper flying?

44
00:05:22,646 --> 00:05:25,937
-Saami, reduce the fan speed.
-Okay, sir.

45
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:51,562
Hey, time to end your vow.
Get up and sit in the chair.

46
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,479
Let me just sign it.

47
00:05:57,812 --> 00:06:00,562
What took you so long to sign it?

48
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:10,062
"With Lord Perumal's grace...

49
00:06:10,271 --> 00:06:14,021
I, Masilamani, rail
from Melur near Madurai."

50
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,104
-Sir, it's hail.
-You've spelt it as "rail"!

51
00:06:18,562 --> 00:06:21,396
"I've been working as a security guard
at BCC Club for 2.5 years.

52
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,562
I'm very poor. I have no one,
but my wife and Mahesh.

53
00:06:24,646 --> 00:06:27,396
My wife worked as a housekeeper
at the same club.

54
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:30,771
Mahesh loves kites. I love Mahesh."

55
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:31,854
God!

56
00:06:32,771 --> 00:06:33,937
"With Lord Perumal's grace..."

57
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,937
Why drag Lord Perumal into every page?

58
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:39,479
"I know my writing style will annoy you.

59
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:42,354
But this is the way I express myself.
I didn't kill Thambidurai."

60
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:47,229
Do killers confess readily?
They all just want to irritate us.

61
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:48,521
Continue reading.

62
00:06:49,146 --> 00:06:51,687
"So being an innocent,

63
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,729
I solemnly seek your forgiveness

64
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,812
from the bottom of my heart
and request you to release me.

65
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:58,229
Gratefully, Masilamani."

66
00:06:58,312 --> 00:07:01,062
Sir, people like him must be
interrogated in our usual style!

67
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:04,104
Venkatesh, he says it's not him.
Why torture him unnecessarily?

68
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:05,979
Sit down, Masilamani.

69
00:07:07,312 --> 00:07:08,979
-So, Venkatesh...
-Sir?

70
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,479
Can we check for other probable suspects?

71
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:14,896
-Why, sir? I don't get it.
-Ask for some coffee. You'll get it.

72
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,062
-Masilamani, what would you like?
-Got it now, sir.

73
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:18,104
I don't want anything.

74
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,896
-Tea or coffee?
-I'm on a fast today.

75
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:21,271
Isn't your fasting time over?

76
00:07:22,271 --> 00:07:25,062
-Mani?
-You ended my vow of silence.

77
00:07:25,604 --> 00:07:28,521
Today... on every 11th lunar day...

78
00:07:29,396 --> 00:07:32,229
not a drop of water
touches my tongue.

79
00:07:32,437 --> 00:07:33,604
What is the prayer about?

80
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,104
The boy you saw outside...

81
00:07:36,896 --> 00:07:37,937
my son, Mahesh.

82
00:07:39,312 --> 00:07:42,146
He doesn't have much time left.

83
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:46,729
That's why...

84
00:07:47,354 --> 00:07:48,354
I'm praying for that.

85
00:07:48,854 --> 00:07:49,812
I...

86
00:07:52,354 --> 00:07:55,187
-Sir, I'd asked for medicines...
-They're getting it all.

87
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:58,187
-The kite?
-They're getting that too.

88
00:07:58,771 --> 00:07:59,771
-Venkatesh?
-Sir?

89
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,104
-You were saying something?
-I also think you're right.

90
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:06,896
The CCTV camera at the
crime scene was turned the other way.

91
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:09,729
From the footage,
we only see him entering and leaving

92
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:12,479
and there is no strong evidence
to prove his guilt.

93
00:08:13,854 --> 00:08:15,812
-Is the camera on?
-Yes, sir.

94
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,187
Sir, coffee.

95
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:18,229
Masilamani,

96
00:08:18,437 --> 00:08:19,562
<i>how did you get the wound</i>
<i>on your forehead?</i>

97
00:08:19,646 --> 00:08:20,604
-That is...
-There was...

98
00:08:20,687 --> 00:08:23,437
Ten days ago, he had a row with
a rickshaw driver at Besant Nagar.

99
00:08:23,521 --> 00:08:26,521
He bashed up his head.
I think a complaint has also been filed.

100
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:29,437
See. You find stitches
like these on slippers!

101
00:08:29,646 --> 00:08:30,854
This is the plight of the poor!

102
00:08:30,937 --> 00:08:32,562
-<i>Sir?</i>
-Oh! Oh!

103
00:08:32,896 --> 00:08:34,562
Don't worry about it. They'll clean it.

104
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:35,729
Wait, wait.

105
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:40,354
Careful!

106
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,937
Give him a few more sheets.

107
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,146
Masilamani?

108
00:08:43,396 --> 00:08:46,729
Please write your
entire statement again.

109
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:49,354
Write it down.

110
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:51,771
Saami, he'll get busted now.

111
00:08:52,146 --> 00:08:53,312
Sit in the chair and write.

112
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:57,521
What are you doing there?

113
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:07,771
What is this?

114
00:09:10,062 --> 00:09:11,396
What the heck is this?

115
00:09:11,687 --> 00:09:14,312
I asked you to rewrite it,
and you are giving me a carbon copy?

116
00:09:14,562 --> 00:09:17,187
Why did you write with a carbon copy?

117
00:09:18,062 --> 00:09:20,521
There was a carbon paper
in the file you gave me.

118
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:24,979
Thought I'd make a copy,
in case coffee gets spilled on it.

119
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,562
Or else you'd ask me to rewrite it.

120
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:29,729
To check if I wrote the same thing.

121
00:09:30,062 --> 00:09:32,896
Neither you nor can I rewrite
the same content.

122
00:09:33,187 --> 00:09:35,937
Not only that,
when you present me at the court,

123
00:09:36,562 --> 00:09:39,229
it's good to have a copy
of my statement, right?

124
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:42,312
-Hey! Are you acting smart?
-Venkatesh.

125
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:45,521
-He needs to be hanged upside down.
-Patience, patience.

126
00:09:45,771 --> 00:09:47,729
-He's shouting, sir.
-I asked you to shut up!

127
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:48,771
I'm scared, sir.

128
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,187
-Look, I'll bash you now.
-Venkat!

129
00:09:50,271 --> 00:09:51,229
Please tell him.

130
00:09:51,312 --> 00:09:53,771
-Calm down, Venkat.
-He just won't shut up!

131
00:09:55,312 --> 00:09:57,437
Did you see how calmly
he's dealing with us?

132
00:09:58,896 --> 00:10:00,479
You're very clever man!

133
00:10:00,854 --> 00:10:04,687
Within two hours of your arrest,
you had the Human Rights send us a letter.

134
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,271
For your trial in court,

135
00:10:07,354 --> 00:10:10,687
you make a copy of your statement!

136
00:10:10,896 --> 00:10:14,437
So you always plan
everything well, right?

137
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:17,146
Including this murder.

138
00:10:17,396 --> 00:10:21,646
I didn't plan to go
to the Human Rights, sir.

139
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:26,146
I wouldn't be able to withstand
the police torture.

140
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:28,354
-Is this the one?
-Yes.

141
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:32,479
I worked with Lawyer Vedachalam
for two years.

142
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:37,271
I told him that the cops are taking me.
He suggested... what's the name?

143
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:41,812
Ah, yes! Human Rights.
He got them to mail you.

144
00:10:41,896 --> 00:10:45,896
-I'm not as smart as you think, sir.
-Yeah, I can see that.

145
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,187
An inspector, one SI and two constables
are enough to handle this case.

146
00:10:49,312 --> 00:10:52,396
But the DC is interested now,
so you can imagine the seriousness.

147
00:10:52,687 --> 00:10:54,979
Don't test my patience.
I'll tear you to pieces!

148
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:57,562
-Tell the truth! Now!
-Venkat, hold on.

149
00:10:58,104 --> 00:11:00,562
We shouldn't treat anyone as
a criminal until proven guilty.

150
00:11:00,646 --> 00:11:02,729
-No, sir, he...
-Is that right, Masilamani?

151
00:11:02,854 --> 00:11:06,562
That's why I don't look into his eyes.
He's terrifying!

152
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:11,354
-You are soft-hearted though.
-I may talk softly,

153
00:11:11,646 --> 00:11:14,812
but my treatment would be very rough.
You can't tolerate that.

154
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:18,062
I could let you go right now...

155
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:21,187
frame you in another case
and bump you off in an "encounter".

156
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:22,562
Do you want to risk it?

157
00:11:22,646 --> 00:11:25,771
This jerk doesn't deserve
so much respect.

158
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:27,604
Human Rights, my foot!

159
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,896
-Just permit me to...
-Venkat!

160
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:34,312
My sympathies aren't for him.
It's for his son sitting outside.

161
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:37,229
I am being patient for the boy's sake.

162
00:11:37,729 --> 00:11:39,604
Hey, Masilamani, sit down!

163
00:11:40,062 --> 00:11:40,937
Sit down!

164
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:44,604
We need the smoke for the
mosquitoes, not the entire town!

165
00:11:44,812 --> 00:11:45,771
Look.

166
00:11:46,062 --> 00:11:48,187
We're not here
to listen to your stories.

167
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:52,812
We'll change our interrogation methods
until we get what we want.

168
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:57,146
So, it's in your interest to cooperate.
Got it?

169
00:11:58,271 --> 00:12:01,437
-Rosie, can you give me that kite?
-It's yours. Wait.

170
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,354
-Rosie!
-Coming, sir.

171
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:06,729
-Got all the medicines?
-Yes, sir.

172
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:09,479
This syrup was available only
in a particular pharmacy.

173
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,771
-OK. Keep it there and shut the door.
-Yes, sir.

174
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:16,937
<i>Masi, it's quite breezy.</i>
<i>Shall I let it go?</i>

175
00:12:17,021 --> 00:12:20,021
<i>It's perfect for flying.</i>
<i>Shall I let it go?</i>

176
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:28,437
Masilamani... Masilamani!

177
00:12:29,396 --> 00:12:30,562
Sir?

178
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:32,229
Recognize this?

179
00:12:33,979 --> 00:12:35,479
How could I not?

180
00:12:35,979 --> 00:12:37,979
I buy it twice a month for Mahesh.

181
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:40,396
Because this is very sweet...

182
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:41,937
he gulps it down.

183
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:44,687
Try giving him the pills
and he'll spit it right out.

184
00:12:45,187 --> 00:12:47,937
-Giving him the pills is quite a task!
-What's he diagnosed with?

185
00:12:48,521 --> 00:12:52,562
"Duchenne muscular dystrophy" it seems!

186
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:55,312
I've said it so many times that
now I've mastered the pronunciation.

187
00:12:55,396 --> 00:12:58,187
-Does that mean it is...
-It means...

188
00:12:58,771 --> 00:13:02,937
all his organs will slowly
cease to function and...

189
00:13:03,437 --> 00:13:04,729
He lost his legs first.

190
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:06,146
Now, he's lost his eyes too.

191
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:10,729
Then the tissues around
his lungs will stop functioning and...

192
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:12,812
he'll find it hard to breathe and...

193
00:13:16,521 --> 00:13:18,146
He's got only five to six years left.

194
00:13:18,354 --> 00:13:20,729
Oh! How long has he had this?

195
00:13:22,479 --> 00:13:23,687
Since he was in the womb.

196
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:26,312
So you buy this syrup twice a month?

197
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:27,521
Dhanaselvam?

198
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:29,937
-Give me the forensic report.
-Just a minute, sir.

199
00:13:31,021 --> 00:13:31,896
Here.

200
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:33,854
The prescription,
a pharmacy bill from your area.

201
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:35,854
They were found at the crime scene.

202
00:13:36,521 --> 00:13:39,937
With this evidence, it took us a month
to confirm you're the killer.

203
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,771
So stop fooling us with
all your stories.

204
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:43,937
Bloody...

205
00:13:45,562 --> 00:13:48,062
You better pay attention
while he's talking to you!

206
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:54,729
This is also expiring soon,
just like Mahesh.

207
00:13:56,271 --> 00:14:00,521
Please ask Rosie to put these
eye drops into Mahesh's eyes.

208
00:14:00,729 --> 00:14:01,979
Don't let any of the men do it.

209
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:05,229
If they aren't gentle with his eyes,
it could become septic.

210
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,562
-Rosie?
-Coming, sir.

211
00:14:07,687 --> 00:14:10,312
-Eye drops for his son.
-Okay, sir.

212
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:11,771
This needs to be pierced open.

213
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:14,646
When you pierce a hole with a pin,

214
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:16,354
make sure it isn't rusted.

215
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:18,312
Otherwise, that'll become another problem.

216
00:14:18,396 --> 00:14:19,729
Policemen are usually rough...

217
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:22,062
Hey! Do you confess to the crime or not?

218
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:27,604
With all this evidence here...

219
00:14:27,896 --> 00:14:29,312
how could I deny it?

220
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:30,521
Saami, move aside.

221
00:14:30,604 --> 00:14:33,062
Hey, tell the truth. Sir is here.

222
00:14:36,521 --> 00:14:38,937
I am talking
because I trust the Commissioner.

223
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,646
Why drag the Commissioner into this?

224
00:14:42,812 --> 00:14:46,187
These reports will ultimately
go to him, right?

225
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,354
-That's why...
-Saami, turn the camera on.

226
00:14:50,354 --> 00:14:51,479
Saami, just a minute.

227
00:14:51,562 --> 00:14:54,229
Erase the footage after the coffee spill
and continue from here.

228
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:55,187
Okay, sir.

229
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,104
<i>Saami sir.</i>

230
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:00,312
<i>-Is the camera on?</i>
-Yes, it is on!

231
00:15:00,396 --> 00:15:02,104
<i>Move that towel away.</i>
It's blocking the view.

232
00:15:02,187 --> 00:15:03,437
Done! Start speaking.

233
00:15:04,854 --> 00:15:06,979
-Shall I start?
-Go ahead.

234
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:08,562
Why did you commit the murder?

235
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:12,979
-Shall I begin with how I did it?
-Whatever!

236
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:20,521
<i>It's about fat.</i>

237
00:15:22,312 --> 00:15:23,312
<i>Fattened by wealth.</i>

238
00:15:25,062 --> 00:15:27,771
<i>To burn that fat,</i>
<i>he goes for a walk every day.</i>

239
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:32,479
His shoes alone cost 24,000.
My three months' salary!

240
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:38,104
This month I didn't go to work at all.
Wonder how much I'll lose.

241
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,312
Masilamani! Over here.
Face the camera and talk.

242
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:46,146
<i>I'd been watching Thambidurai</i>
<i>for a while.</i>

243
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:50,229
<i>He bought his mistress a very big house.</i>

244
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:52,146
<i>He spends his nights there.</i>

245
00:15:52,437 --> 00:15:55,562
<i>And he parks his Benz</i>

246
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:58,229
away from prying eyes
at a temple nearby.

247
00:15:58,771 --> 00:16:01,479
Every morning, he goes for a walk
then heads home.

248
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,521
There's a dingy alley on that route.

249
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:07,062
He takes a leak there every day
before heading home.

250
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:09,562
That alley would be pitch-dark!

251
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:14,229
<i>I thought I'd finish him off</i>
<i>right there, but...</i>

252
00:16:14,854 --> 00:16:17,521
They installed a CCTV camera over there.

253
00:16:18,396 --> 00:16:22,896
I crept behind the CCTV camera
and turned it away.

254
00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:26,771
<i>Since Traffic Ramasamy</i>
<i>held a protest there,</i>

255
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:29,396
the wall is peppered with

256
00:16:29,479 --> 00:16:32,729
giant government hoardings,
all over the place.

257
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:35,687
I hid behind those banners.

258
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:39,021
That thing people wear in winters...
The monkey cap.

259
00:16:39,104 --> 00:16:40,896
I wore that and...

260
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,396
Show how you did it.

261
00:16:42,729 --> 00:16:45,146
<i>How do I enact wearing a monkey cap now?</i>

262
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:46,271
Hey!

263
00:16:46,604 --> 00:16:47,937
<i>Why are you looking at me like that?</i>

264
00:16:48,021 --> 00:16:50,729
How can you be funny
after committing a murder?

265
00:16:51,354 --> 00:16:53,062
Go. Go there and enact it.

266
00:16:55,229 --> 00:16:56,104
<i>Well, I...</i>

267
00:16:56,937 --> 00:17:00,312
I'm not that good an actor, sir.
I'll still try my best.

268
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:02,479
He talks like an Oscar nominee!

269
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:04,312
-Sir!
-Leave it, Saami.

270
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:29,521
On that day, I wore a similar monkey cap
and hid behind the banners...

271
00:17:29,771 --> 00:17:31,229
waiting for him.

272
00:17:32,354 --> 00:17:34,062
<i>Hello? Hello.</i>

273
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:35,812
<i>-Can you hear me?</i>
-Here he comes.

274
00:17:35,896 --> 00:17:37,437
<i>Is the signal weak just like you are?</i>

275
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:38,437
He's nearing.

276
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:41,271
<i>Hold the phone properly.</i>
<i>I can't hear you.</i>

277
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,687
<i>-Hello!</i>
<i>-Hello!</i>

278
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:47,479
<i>-Senthil? What's the matter?</i>
<i>-What's the matter?</i>

279
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:53,479
<i>His piss is spraying on my feet.</i>

280
00:17:54,062 --> 00:17:56,354
<i>I'm scared he'd spot me.</i>

281
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:59,312
<i>But he's busy ogling at a starlet</i>
<i>on the banner!</i>

282
00:18:00,604 --> 00:18:04,062
<i>Pay the couple 500,000 rupees each</i>
<i>and get their power of attorney.</i>

283
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:06,521
<i>If they refuse, finish them off.</i>
<i>Got it?</i>

284
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:07,812
<i>The police?</i>

285
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:10,896
<i>Money can tempt even a corpse.</i>
<i>Why are cops any different?</i>

286
00:18:11,271 --> 00:18:14,146
AC sir, did you notice
how he mocked the police?

287
00:18:14,229 --> 00:18:16,604
I can see who's mocking us.
Go on.

288
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:19,687
He wet his pants and bends over.

289
00:18:19,937 --> 00:18:22,562
I wanted to take my chance
to finish him off while he was bent.

290
00:18:22,646 --> 00:18:24,729
<i>My pant and hands got wet.</i>

291
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,937
<i>-Wait, wait.</i>
-I move in slowly...

292
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:28,521
<i>Who is it? Let go of me!</i>

293
00:18:28,604 --> 00:18:31,854
<i>Leave me! Get off of me!</i>

294
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:41,062
He slides...

295
00:18:42,812 --> 00:18:44,854
Masilamani, what weapon did you use?

296
00:18:45,937 --> 00:18:50,437
-Dhanaselvam, the murder weapon...
-They use it to fly kites...

297
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:51,687
I'll tell you, sir!

298
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:57,687
I told you Mahesh loves to fly kites.

299
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:00,979
Who knows how long will he live?

300
00:19:01,062 --> 00:19:02,312
<i>Tell me, honey!</i>

301
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:05,646
<i>What's wrong with our child?</i>

302
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,354
<i>What is the doctor saying?</i>

303
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:10,021
Okay, it's okay.

304
00:19:10,146 --> 00:19:12,729
<i>Don't hide it. Tell me the truth, honey.</i>

305
00:19:12,812 --> 00:19:15,229
-Why are you asking me?
<i>-Who else do I ask?</i>

306
00:19:15,937 --> 00:19:17,437
We need to ask God...

307
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:20,521
Why is He testing us?

308
00:19:23,354 --> 00:19:25,854
They said he'd live only for
10 to 12 years.

309
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:30,354
<i>-What are you saying?</i>
-Masilamani? Masilamani?

310
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:34,521
Half the time you speak to us
and the rest with yourself.

311
00:19:35,021 --> 00:19:36,104
I don't understand!

312
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:39,729
-I think he's mentally disturbed.
-I think he's pretending.

313
00:19:40,271 --> 00:19:41,854
We'll see.
Masilamani.

314
00:19:42,437 --> 00:19:44,812
You slit his throat.
You didn't say what happened next?

315
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:47,146
Yeah... that...

316
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,812
I moved my hand back and forth...

317
00:19:51,229 --> 00:19:53,979
When I found out that
I used a kite string...

318
00:19:54,854 --> 00:19:57,104
-I...
-Can't hear you.

319
00:19:57,312 --> 00:19:59,646
I took the string and the kite...

320
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:03,396
Mahesh and I go to the Marina beach.

321
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:05,062
There... "Masi, Masi...

322
00:20:05,146 --> 00:20:06,812
-It's quite breezy.
<i>-It's breezy.</i>

323
00:20:06,896 --> 00:20:09,021
-Shall I let it go? Tell me, quick!
<i>-Shall I let it go? Tell me, quick!</i>

324
00:20:09,104 --> 00:20:10,104
-Shall I?
<i>-Shall I?</i>

325
00:20:14,354 --> 00:20:17,646
He'd laugh. He'd laugh so heartily.
Don't know...

326
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:18,896
-how long will he...
-Masilamani?

327
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:22,021
Tell us how you killed the guy.
Stop reeling kites!

328
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:23,354
-Huh?
<i>-Sir.</i>

329
00:20:24,521 --> 00:20:26,104
<i>This is how I speak.</i>

330
00:20:26,937 --> 00:20:28,312
<i>Listen, if you can...</i>

331
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,729
<i>or write whatever you want.</i>

332
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:34,354
I'll sign it and give it back.

333
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:36,437
-Venkatesh?
-Sir?

334
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:39,729
-Let him speak as he wishes.
-Isn't that what he's doing?

335
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,562
Look at him! Even as we speak...

336
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:49,937
Hey!

337
00:20:51,021 --> 00:20:52,604
Go away! Go away.

338
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:58,354
You wanted to know...
how I slit his throat, right?

339
00:21:01,354 --> 00:21:05,229
The string... that is made specially
to fly kites...

340
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:06,396
that was...

341
00:21:06,646 --> 00:21:09,812
If you hold it with bare hands,
it tears the skin.

342
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,646
I inquired about the gloves,
they say it's 75!

343
00:21:14,562 --> 00:21:18,562
If I had 75, I would rather
buy my son a health drink.

344
00:21:20,104 --> 00:21:21,104
So...

345
00:21:21,937 --> 00:21:23,729
I wrapped both my hands...

346
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:27,271
tight with a kerchief...

347
00:21:28,437 --> 00:21:32,896
I put the kite string
over the man who bent over...

348
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:35,521
and slit his throat repeatedly.

349
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:40,896
The vein in his throat bursts open...
Boom!

350
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,187
Blood...

351
00:21:44,146 --> 00:21:45,146
gushing out.

352
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:46,812
As he...

353
00:21:47,771 --> 00:21:48,771
slumps down...

354
00:21:49,104 --> 00:21:51,187
he was still trembling.

355
00:21:52,021 --> 00:21:54,104
Blood was still dripping down.

356
00:21:54,854 --> 00:21:59,062
When I saw that,
I was filled with anger... anger!

357
00:21:59,854 --> 00:22:02,146
I took a big rock nearby...

358
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:03,521
What are you doing?

359
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:06,146
-Masi?
-Sir, why is he violent...

360
00:22:06,229 --> 00:22:08,437
-He's acting so weird!
-Let's see what he does.

361
00:22:08,937 --> 00:22:09,812
Die!

362
00:22:10,271 --> 00:22:12,104
Saami, get someone to clean that.

363
00:22:14,271 --> 00:22:15,979
-Uncle.
-Yes, tell me.

364
00:22:16,062 --> 00:22:18,562
Please call Rosie. I need to pee.

365
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:20,937
<i>I wore a sacred scarf...</i>

366
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:23,396
and spoke of murder. Forgive me, Lord!

367
00:22:23,812 --> 00:22:25,021
-Saami sir.
-Tell me.

368
00:22:25,104 --> 00:22:29,187
If Mahesh asks, just tell him- "Your dad
is attending a police interview

369
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:31,771
and since he's promptly answering
all the questions

370
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:34,771
they're confused about
what to ask him next."

371
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:38,771
Please don't mind.
I usually tell my son a story.

372
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:41,771
I'm actually a guard at the club.

373
00:22:41,854 --> 00:22:44,729
But I've told him that I'm the manager.

374
00:22:44,854 --> 00:22:46,437
You have a quirky sense of humor!

375
00:22:47,271 --> 00:22:49,479
No one would believe you killed someone.

376
00:22:49,562 --> 00:22:50,729
But you believe me, don't you, sir?

377
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:54,771
Don't sneak up on me.
Are you mopping the floor or me?

378
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:56,354
-OK, move your leg.
-New at work?

379
00:22:58,521 --> 00:22:59,479
Tell me, sir.

380
00:23:02,729 --> 00:23:04,562
Uh oh... Rosie!

381
00:23:04,646 --> 00:23:06,854
Why did you have to trouble
the AC or DC for this?

382
00:23:07,021 --> 00:23:09,937
He's cooperated well
with a full confession.

383
00:23:10,604 --> 00:23:11,562
-Dhanaselvam?
-Sir?

384
00:23:11,646 --> 00:23:14,604
Call my wife and tell her
I'll be home for dinner.

385
00:23:14,687 --> 00:23:15,604
Okay, sir.

386
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:17,062
-Masilamani?
-Sir?

387
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,187
Write down everything
you've just said so far.

388
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:23,104
-Give him some papers.
-Yes, sir

389
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:34,604
-Here you go, sir.
-What is this?

390
00:23:35,104 --> 00:23:37,229
-I've written and signed it too.
-Hey!

391
00:23:37,812 --> 00:23:38,937
Are you kidding me?

392
00:23:39,562 --> 00:23:40,521
I didn't ask that!

393
00:23:40,604 --> 00:23:44,354
Didn't you tell us about slitting
his throat, bashing him with a rock?

394
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:47,396
Write that down!
Why are you giving me the old one?

395
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:49,021
That's what I've written.

396
00:23:49,104 --> 00:23:50,687
-What have you written?
-Look.

397
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:56,604
"With Lord Perumal's grace.
From, Masilamani.

398
00:23:56,687 --> 00:24:00,604
I hail from Melur... no one
but my wife and Mahesh...

399
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:05,021
I know my words will annoy you.
I didn't kill Thambidurai.

400
00:24:05,104 --> 00:24:07,479
His bad karma took my form
and killed him...

401
00:24:07,604 --> 00:24:11,354
Instead of why I killed,
I'll tell you how I killed him."

402
00:24:18,604 --> 00:24:22,979
I thought someone burst out laughing
to mock you.

403
00:24:23,271 --> 00:24:27,562
I'd kept the tap open then.
Someone must've turned the motor on...

404
00:24:28,187 --> 00:24:29,062
You continue reading, sir.

405
00:24:29,396 --> 00:24:34,646
"He goes for a walk every day.
So I waited for him on his usual route.

406
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:37,854
Since he was talking while peeing,
his pant got wet.

407
00:24:38,104 --> 00:24:43,271
As he bent over, I slit his neck
and smashed his male organ with a rock.

408
00:24:43,812 --> 00:24:46,479
God has punished him appropriately."

409
00:24:46,562 --> 00:24:48,062
-He's messing with us, sir!
-That is...

410
00:24:48,187 --> 00:24:49,854
That's the trouble
if you are not educated.

411
00:24:49,937 --> 00:24:52,187
I neglected studies then
and I'm struggling now.

412
00:24:52,479 --> 00:24:55,354
AC sir didn't read the letter right,
and now you're all struggling!

413
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57,146
What would the AC have thought?

414
00:24:57,271 --> 00:24:59,854
Who would readily admit to their crimes?

415
00:25:00,021 --> 00:25:01,646
-Isn't it, sir?
-Move.

416
00:25:02,021 --> 00:25:02,979
Go, sit.

417
00:25:04,521 --> 00:25:06,437
Get him to sign the declaration form

418
00:25:06,562 --> 00:25:08,604
and arrange to produce him
in the court tomorrow.

419
00:25:09,271 --> 00:25:10,646
Hey, sign this!

420
00:25:12,437 --> 00:25:13,896
Venkatesh, I'll leave.

421
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:17,812
Oh no!

422
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:19,021
Sir, sir!

423
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:22,604
-You're leaving without a word!
-Should I inform you too?

424
00:25:23,896 --> 00:25:25,437
The poor have no say!

425
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:28,021
Am I a politician
that you'd listen to me?

426
00:25:28,479 --> 00:25:31,812
Sir, look. Everything here
is written in English.

427
00:25:32,104 --> 00:25:35,354
How can I sign this without
understanding the content?

428
00:25:35,437 --> 00:25:36,312
Dhanaselvam!

429
00:25:36,396 --> 00:25:37,812
Don't get on my nerves!

430
00:25:37,896 --> 00:25:38,729
Sorry, sir. Give it to me.

431
00:25:38,812 --> 00:25:40,771
-Stop playing with him.
-Give it to me. Getting on my nerves.

432
00:25:41,021 --> 00:25:42,187
Give him the Tamil form
and get it signed.

433
00:25:42,271 --> 00:25:45,729
Meanwhile, may I ask you something?

434
00:25:45,812 --> 00:25:47,312
What? Make it quick!

435
00:25:48,229 --> 00:25:52,021
<i>Sir... last January 16th...</i>

436
00:25:52,354 --> 00:25:54,687
<i>in Mattuthavani near Madurai...</i>

437
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:57,896
<i>a murder took place</i>
<i>early in the morning.</i>

438
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:00,229
Have you found the killer yet?

439
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:02,146
He is a big nuisance!

440
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:04,312
Hey! Why should we find the killer?

441
00:26:04,687 --> 00:26:05,854
We need to ask the Madurai superintendent.

442
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:06,854
Sir, you can...

443
00:26:06,937 --> 00:26:09,146
It'd be nice if you can ask him
and let me know.

444
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:10,271
Here, sign this

445
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:13,854
OK, fine! I'll sign it.

446
00:26:13,937 --> 00:26:17,937
Hope all the details are correct.
Because I'm signing without specs...

447
00:26:18,021 --> 00:26:19,021
Hold on!

448
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:21,479
Why did you ask about that murder?

449
00:26:21,771 --> 00:26:25,437
If they've arrested someone for it...

450
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:27,354
-please release him.
-Why?

451
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:36,729
I committed that murder.

452
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:38,229
What the heck? Sir, this is...

453
00:26:38,312 --> 00:26:39,312
Sir, sir...

454
00:26:39,396 --> 00:26:42,104
Please don't panic.
I beg you to remain calm.

455
00:26:42,187 --> 00:26:43,687
I'll tell you the truth.

456
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,187
I can lie about this case and get away...

457
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:49,021
But if I lie about that case,
an innocent may get caught.

458
00:26:49,146 --> 00:26:51,729
Sir, your phone is ringing.

459
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:55,479
-Must be your wife.
-Saami, tell them I'm busy.

460
00:26:55,646 --> 00:26:56,604
-You go on.
-Hello? Madam?

461
00:26:56,687 --> 00:26:59,021
-Sir, it's...
-You said you'd be home for dinner?

462
00:26:59,104 --> 00:27:02,312
-Yes. But, tell her I can't come now!
-Sir is busy... What, madam?

463
00:27:03,021 --> 00:27:03,937
Aappam?

464
00:27:04,021 --> 00:27:06,979
-She says appam must be eaten hot!
-Saami!

465
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:09,021
-Do you have any sense?
-Sorry, sir!

466
00:27:09,104 --> 00:27:10,146
-Saami sir!
-Sir is...

467
00:27:10,271 --> 00:27:11,187
-Saami sir!
-Please hang up.

468
00:27:11,312 --> 00:27:12,896
Why disturb DC for petty issues?

469
00:27:12,979 --> 00:27:15,187
Can't you handle it yourself?
Sir?

470
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:18,271
The fact is, appam
tastes better when eaten hot.

471
00:27:18,354 --> 00:27:19,937
Go home and come back.

472
00:27:20,021 --> 00:27:25,729
If your wife waits at home for you
and worried if you're late...

473
00:27:26,771 --> 00:27:28,396
is a great blessing!

474
00:27:29,271 --> 00:27:30,812
You eat and then come back.

475
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:33,437
I'll write a detailed account of what
happened and sign it.

476
00:27:33,521 --> 00:27:36,354
Enough! No need for all your details!

477
00:27:36,437 --> 00:27:38,229
-Just tell me what happened!
-I'll tell you.

478
00:27:38,604 --> 00:27:40,187
That... Saami sir?

479
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:43,146
-Is that on?
-It is. You speak!

480
00:27:43,854 --> 00:27:45,729
What do you think of yourself?

481
00:27:46,187 --> 00:27:49,104
I want to somehow get off this case...

482
00:27:49,187 --> 00:27:51,312
Oh yeah?
We'll definitely set you free!

483
00:27:51,521 --> 00:27:53,562
We arrest you for a murder

484
00:27:53,646 --> 00:27:57,812
and you confess to a murder
that was committed earlier.

485
00:27:58,187 --> 00:28:01,729
-And you still believe you'll be freed?
-I don't believe in me.

486
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:03,729
I trust in you and my savior Perumal.

487
00:28:03,896 --> 00:28:06,562
In fact, I see my Lord Perumal in you!

488
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,937
They say elder's actions
are akin to the Lord's.

489
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:11,312
It doesn't matter
if you or Perumal does it.

490
00:28:11,437 --> 00:28:13,729
Even the day before,
I met with Perumal's PA...

491
00:28:13,812 --> 00:28:15,604
What?
Lord Perumal's PA, huh?

492
00:28:15,896 --> 00:28:19,562
Yeah, I meant the priest who helps us
send our prayers to the Lord.

493
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:25,021
I handed him a request to be
placed before Perumal's eyes... no, feet.

494
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:27,812
The day he notices my request...

495
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:29,646
I'll be free that day!

496
00:28:30,354 --> 00:28:31,979
-Hey! Masilamani?
-Sir, sir?

497
00:28:32,104 --> 00:28:34,812
-Please have some water.
-I can take care of myself.

498
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:37,479
Just tell me what happened.

499
00:28:38,229 --> 00:28:42,312
Please ask someone to check
if the details I gave are correct.

500
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:43,354
Dhanaselvam?

501
00:28:43,521 --> 00:28:45,729
-For God's sake, call the Madurai SP!
-Yes, sir.

502
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:47,646
OK, go ahead!

503
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,771
<i>January 16th was the harvest festival.</i>

504
00:28:51,854 --> 00:28:54,979
<i>I went to Madurai on the 13th...</i>

505
00:28:55,062 --> 00:28:58,562
-Madurai SP Rahul's on the line.
-Put him on the speaker.

506
00:28:58,646 --> 00:29:00,062
<i>I rented a room.</i>

507
00:29:03,229 --> 00:29:04,854
Called you to get something clarified.

508
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:09,146
On January 16th last year,
in your district...

509
00:29:09,229 --> 00:29:10,979
Masilamani, what's that place?

510
00:29:11,437 --> 00:29:14,229
<i>Hmm... Maatu... Mattuthavani, sir.</i>

511
00:29:14,312 --> 00:29:18,146
Yeah, is there a murder case filed in
Mattuthavani on that day early morning?

512
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:19,937
<i>Let me check.</i>

513
00:29:21,021 --> 00:29:22,229
You go on, Masilamani.

514
00:29:23,104 --> 00:29:24,271
What should I say, sir?

515
00:29:24,812 --> 00:29:27,687
From the point when I checked in
at Amudha lodge, right?

516
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:29,312
At Amudha Lodge...

517
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:30,979
I stayed at Amudha lodge.

518
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,812
<i>From the Thamukam grounds</i>
<i>where I stayed...</i>

519
00:29:34,146 --> 00:29:35,354
<i>to Mattuthavani...</i>

520
00:29:35,437 --> 00:29:36,312
Tell me, Rahul.

521
00:29:37,646 --> 00:29:41,937
<i>At 5:45 a.m., while he was walking,</i>
<i>Vasudevan, a chit fund company owner</i>

522
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:43,479
<i>was brutally murdered.</i>

523
00:29:43,687 --> 00:29:45,896
Has the accused been found, Rahul?

524
00:29:45,979 --> 00:29:48,396
<i>No, sir. There's something fishy</i>
<i>about the case.</i>

525
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:52,771
<i>The accused went there and</i>
<i>turned the CCTV camera away.</i>

526
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:56,146
<i>Even the tracking dog Caesar went up to</i>
<i>Thamukam grounds and came back.</i>

527
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:59,562
<i>Apart from the evidence, we've learned</i>
<i>that the killer came from Tirupati...</i>

528
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:01,562
<i>We couldn't proceed further.</i>

529
00:30:03,437 --> 00:30:06,604
We have a man here claiming
that he committed the murder.

530
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:17,937
-Masilamani?
-Sir?

531
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:19,729
-A photo, please.
-Put that down and look here.

532
00:30:20,104 --> 00:30:21,312
Just a minute, sir.

533
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:24,229
Can I quickly meet Mahesh and come back?

534
00:30:24,437 --> 00:30:25,437
Why do you want to meet him?

535
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:30,021
Now and then, I have to crack jokes
and make him laugh.

536
00:30:30,104 --> 00:30:32,854
Else that's it.
He'll keep a long face.

537
00:30:33,479 --> 00:30:35,979
The sooner you tell us the truth,
the quicker you're out of here.

538
00:30:36,229 --> 00:30:39,229
Else, you both will stay put.
Get it?

539
00:30:40,396 --> 00:30:43,479
You assume I'm clueless and you're
torturing me in a different way.

540
00:30:44,021 --> 00:30:46,562
I went to fetch him from school at 3:30.

541
00:30:46,771 --> 00:30:49,146
Your jeep showed up
and brought us both here.

542
00:30:49,354 --> 00:30:51,604
You have him there and me here.

543
00:30:51,729 --> 00:30:56,687
If he misses me and starts crying...
you'll find it difficult to handle him.

544
00:31:05,562 --> 00:31:06,562
He'll stop breathing.

545
00:31:07,021 --> 00:31:08,562
It happened once. That's it!

546
00:31:08,646 --> 00:31:10,562
We almost died watching him in pain.

547
00:31:11,187 --> 00:31:13,312
If something like that
happens again...

548
00:31:14,896 --> 00:31:16,896
I don't know...
I don't know what I'll do.

549
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:18,771
Whoever it is, I won't care.

550
00:31:19,104 --> 00:31:21,187
Everyone... I'll kill everyone!

551
00:31:21,271 --> 00:31:23,271
-Hey, watch your words!
-I'll kill you and go to jail.

552
00:31:23,354 --> 00:31:25,562
-Stop! You too!
-What's left for me here?

553
00:31:26,604 --> 00:31:28,437
Masilamani! Calm down.

554
00:31:28,854 --> 00:31:33,354
-He's so rude! Always, "Why? Why now?"
-That's all part of an inquiry.

555
00:31:33,437 --> 00:31:35,562
-What?
-Not everyone talks the same way!

556
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:37,854
You want to see your son, right?

557
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:40,146
We'll go once we take the picture.
Face the camera first.

558
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:42,021
-Saami?
-Masilamani? Look here?

559
00:31:42,104 --> 00:31:43,104
One minute.

560
00:31:43,396 --> 00:31:44,729
They make you cry and take a photo!

561
00:31:50,812 --> 00:31:52,146
Enough! Just send one.

562
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:53,479
Don't waste time picking the photos!

563
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:57,937
<i>I am Masilamani, I hardly got money</i>

564
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:00,937
<i>You are my wealth, my dear</i>

565
00:32:01,187 --> 00:32:02,354
Great!

566
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:04,271
So, why did you go to Tirupati?

567
00:32:04,479 --> 00:32:08,104
Why else?
To pray for Mahesh's good health.

568
00:32:08,187 --> 00:32:10,687
But why did you go particularly
before this murder?

569
00:32:11,146 --> 00:32:14,187
It's a first murder for me!
I went to pray so that it goes smoothly...

570
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:17,312
and not get caught by cops like you.

571
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:18,937
OK, how did you carry out this murder?

572
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,562
-Shall I tell you why I did it?
-Stop torturing us!

573
00:32:22,896 --> 00:32:24,729
We ask you "why",
you want to tell us "how".

574
00:32:24,854 --> 00:32:26,687
If we ask you "how",
you want to say "why"?

575
00:32:26,771 --> 00:32:28,646
I don't mean to hurt your feelings, sir.

576
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:31,521
-I'll tell you how I did it.
-Tell me!

577
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:34,896
Tell you what, sir? "Why"? Or "how"?

578
00:32:34,979 --> 00:32:36,354
Say any damn thing you want!

579
00:32:37,396 --> 00:32:38,937
Criminals getting away
after committing a crime

580
00:32:39,021 --> 00:32:42,312
are outnumbered by those
who aren't able to get away!

581
00:32:42,854 --> 00:32:46,354
At the BCC Club where I work,

582
00:32:46,687 --> 00:32:50,021
Vasudevan aka Madurai Vasu
was the secretary for two years.

583
00:32:52,687 --> 00:32:56,437
I decided to finish him
only for her sake.

584
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,562
<i>They're blackmailing me!</i>

585
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:04,896
<i>They're threatening to post it all</i>
<i>on the Internet.</i>

586
00:33:05,937 --> 00:33:07,354
Blackmail, huh?

587
00:33:08,562 --> 00:33:10,729
Had you told me,
I would've finished them off!

588
00:33:10,979 --> 00:33:13,812
<i>I didn't because I knew</i>
<i>you'd get mad.</i>

589
00:33:20,437 --> 00:33:21,729
I was furious...

590
00:33:22,771 --> 00:33:24,854
when Usha hesitantly blurted it out.

591
00:33:24,937 --> 00:33:25,771
Who is Usha?

592
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:29,062
<i>This sacred thread</i>

593
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:31,479
<i>Shall be the foundation of my life</i>

594
00:33:31,562 --> 00:33:36,604
<i>I tie this around your neck</i>

595
00:33:36,896 --> 00:33:40,604
<i>May you live a hundred seasons</i>

596
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:46,354
<i>This sacred thread</i>

597
00:33:46,729 --> 00:33:49,271
On one side,
they would've written "Masilamani".

598
00:33:49,354 --> 00:33:52,437
On the other side, against the yellow,
and in red text,

599
00:33:52,521 --> 00:33:56,562
it'll be "Fair maiden, graceful
- M. Usha, PGDCA...

600
00:33:56,646 --> 00:33:59,021
-in a beautiful, bold font.
-What's PGDCA?

601
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:02,437
An ordinary computer course
that hardly requires any qualification.

602
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:04,021
God! Sir?

603
00:34:04,104 --> 00:34:06,521
In our village, it's considered
a great qualification!

604
00:34:07,271 --> 00:34:08,396
On that day...

605
00:34:09,479 --> 00:34:11,729
I was all dressed up as the groom...

606
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:16,896
That was the first time
I was wearing a silk scarf.

607
00:34:17,271 --> 00:34:19,187
I was floating on cloud nine...

608
00:34:19,646 --> 00:34:20,771
When she comes...

609
00:34:21,562 --> 00:34:24,062
She was looking like a beautiful,
bronze lamp draped in silk.

610
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,271
They bring her to me
and make her sit down...

611
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:31,312
I was feeling goose bumps all over!

612
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:35,562
The boys were all teasing, screaming...
"It's a mismatch, mismatch!"

613
00:34:35,646 --> 00:34:38,187
She was way out of my... my league!

614
00:34:39,271 --> 00:34:41,021
We don't have time to listen
to your love story!

615
00:34:41,354 --> 00:34:43,271
Just tell us
how you committed the murder?

616
00:34:43,604 --> 00:34:44,521
Hey!

617
00:34:44,896 --> 00:34:46,437
Why did you kill Vasudevan?

618
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:48,396
That Vasu...

619
00:34:51,646 --> 00:34:52,771
That Vasu...

620
00:34:54,229 --> 00:34:56,062
I watched that Vasudevan struggle...

621
00:35:02,646 --> 00:35:04,646
There he goes again!

622
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:06,979
Hey! Go!

623
00:35:09,562 --> 00:35:12,396
Mahesh? Mahesh!
Constable, please come here!

624
00:35:13,562 --> 00:35:14,937
Baby sparrows, sir.

625
00:35:15,437 --> 00:35:18,896
They're trapped by a cat
like how I'm trapped by you.

626
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:22,354
Don't be upset
that I'm calling you a cat.

627
00:35:22,979 --> 00:35:25,729
See it through the sparrow's eyes,
and you'll understand.

628
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:30,354
You'll realize... the relentless panic...
every minute.

629
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:32,437
At least here, there's just one cat.

630
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:37,146
Nothing. All it takes is for a passerby
to throw a stone at it.

631
00:35:37,229 --> 00:35:38,104
That's it!

632
00:35:38,312 --> 00:35:41,271
That's why I dropped a huge rock on him!

633
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:51,979
Saami, go check the inverter.

634
00:35:58,062 --> 00:35:58,937
<i>Who's that?</i>

635
00:35:59,937 --> 00:36:01,896
-What?
-Mahesh is having a panic attack,

636
00:36:01,979 --> 00:36:03,979
and finding it hard to breathe.

637
00:36:04,062 --> 00:36:07,104
It looks alarming!
Shall we inform his father?

638
00:36:08,021 --> 00:36:09,562
Arrange to take him to the hospital.

639
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:11,687
Even if something happens,

640
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:13,771
don't inform him unless I tell you.
Got it?

641
00:36:19,979 --> 00:36:21,562
You checked in.

642
00:36:21,687 --> 00:36:23,396
You stoned him.
What happened in between?

643
00:36:24,521 --> 00:36:25,646
The power is back.

644
00:36:26,604 --> 00:36:29,771
The first day, I waited.
I waited even on the second day.

645
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,479
On the third day,
I stoned him to death.

646
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:33,646
15th... 13th, 14th, 15th...

647
00:36:35,687 --> 00:36:37,646
Why are you all giving me strange looks?

648
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:40,312
Do you think I'm rambling?

649
00:36:41,229 --> 00:36:42,229
Some nonsense.

650
00:36:42,646 --> 00:36:44,271
So many deaths...

651
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:45,979
fresh in my mind.

652
00:36:46,312 --> 00:36:48,021
This is the only way I narrate.

653
00:36:49,646 --> 00:36:52,312
Am I a seasoned killer, sir?

654
00:36:54,021 --> 00:36:56,437
Saami sir, remember what the DC said...

655
00:36:56,646 --> 00:37:01,354
"Remove the part after the coffee spill
and join this footage."

656
00:37:01,521 --> 00:37:05,687
Also, put all my random ramblings
in the correct order.

657
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:08,396
-Sir, I'd be grateful if you allowed it.
-I got it.

658
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,729
-Just say whatever you feel.
-I feel like peeing, sir.

659
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:12,937
You've kept me locked up
for a long time.

660
00:37:13,062 --> 00:37:15,479
-Look at his arrogance.
-I've been controlling it.

661
00:37:15,687 --> 00:37:17,604
I can't hold any longer.
Can I pee?

662
00:37:17,687 --> 00:37:19,479
-Go.
-I'll be back in a second.

663
00:37:19,604 --> 00:37:22,271
Getting thrashed by cops in those days
would make criminals pee right there.

664
00:37:22,396 --> 00:37:23,687
But you haven't beaten me at all.

665
00:37:23,771 --> 00:37:27,896
You understand well enough to treat
a criminal with humanity.

666
00:37:28,187 --> 00:37:30,896
If only I were that understanding,
why would I...

667
00:37:31,271 --> 00:37:32,562
come here and...

668
00:37:43,312 --> 00:37:44,521
<i>Cheers!</i>

669
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:59,104
DC sir, an important thing.

670
00:37:59,187 --> 00:38:01,354
-That's why when I was peeing...
-Tell me, Masilamani.

671
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:07,896
<i>This guy Vasu would always</i>
<i>be in a big group and partying.</i>

672
00:38:07,979 --> 00:38:09,271
<i>Hard to catch him alone.</i>

673
00:38:09,354 --> 00:38:13,396
<i>These rabid dogs party all night</i>
<i>and grow a big belly.</i>

674
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:17,104
<i>And to lose that belly,</i>
<i>they go on a walk every morning.</i>

675
00:38:17,187 --> 00:38:18,187
He does it too.

676
00:38:18,271 --> 00:38:20,937
<i>I figured out his walking route... God!</i>

677
00:38:25,729 --> 00:38:27,771
It was just as dark
at Gandhi park as today.

678
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:28,729
Saami, get me that cigarette.

679
00:38:28,854 --> 00:38:30,437
I was there at 4:30 a.m.

680
00:38:30,521 --> 00:38:35,354
There was a life-size garbage bin
on one side.

681
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:37,437
A wall on the other side.

682
00:38:37,687 --> 00:38:42,521
In the small gap between the
bin and wall, I hide like a lizard.

683
00:38:44,271 --> 00:38:45,854
He parks his car and walks in.

684
00:38:47,271 --> 00:38:48,521
He was smoking too.

685
00:38:49,354 --> 00:38:51,146
God! God! God!

686
00:38:56,271 --> 00:38:58,646
We don't need to
kill people like him.

687
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:02,646
They'll keep coughing and damage their
lungs and will soon kill themselves!

688
00:39:02,979 --> 00:39:04,062
Did you quit?

689
00:39:04,146 --> 00:39:07,646
If you kick the habit,
it'll benefit your health, DC sir.

690
00:39:07,729 --> 00:39:10,271
Look who is advising whom!

691
00:39:10,354 --> 00:39:13,271
From the looks of it, he'll become a
saint and make us feel guilty, sir.

692
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,854
-He's coming!
-Who?

693
00:39:17,937 --> 00:39:19,146
G Vasudevan.

694
00:39:25,687 --> 00:39:27,479
Suddenly he's right next to me.

695
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:29,396
Imagine my plight!

696
00:39:45,854 --> 00:39:46,896
Will this do, sir?

697
00:39:47,354 --> 00:39:51,187
-It's tiring to play the parts...
-Why don't act a little faster!

698
00:39:51,271 --> 00:39:53,437
You want me to act faster, sir?

699
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:57,021
I was here, he was tying his
shoe laces for so long...

700
00:39:57,146 --> 00:39:58,979
Finally, when he walks away,
I run after him!

701
00:39:59,062 --> 00:40:01,396
I turn around and see two mad dogs
chasing me.

702
00:40:01,479 --> 00:40:05,021
I run back to Amudha lodge,
hit my head hard and fell back.

703
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:08,271
I wrap myself in a blanket and
there are 50 ghosts, scaring me!

704
00:40:08,354 --> 00:40:11,146
I couldn't sleep all night, sir!

705
00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:13,687
The next morning I ran back
to the same spot, sir.

706
00:40:13,771 --> 00:40:18,187
I wait, looking around. But he doesn't
turn up at his usual time, sir.

707
00:40:18,271 --> 00:40:21,312
He comes ten minutes later
with another woman!

708
00:40:21,396 --> 00:40:22,479
She's also walking with him.

709
00:40:22,562 --> 00:40:25,479
She may have been his wife or
someone else's.

710
00:40:25,562 --> 00:40:26,729
He's a total womanizer!

711
00:40:26,812 --> 00:40:27,812
Sir?

712
00:40:28,479 --> 00:40:31,687
It's very hard to speak
without a break, sir.

713
00:40:32,104 --> 00:40:33,646
Can I take short breaks, sir?

714
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:36,479
If you finish, we'll close the case
and be on our way.

715
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:40,354
We're hoping you'd get to the point,
but you keep beating about the...

716
00:40:42,146 --> 00:40:45,396
On the third day,
I decide to finish him off...

717
00:40:46,021 --> 00:40:48,354
I took some cow dung and...

718
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:51,062
put it in front of me.

719
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:52,771
It stinks, sir.

720
00:40:52,896 --> 00:40:54,479
I put it there and waited.

721
00:40:55,271 --> 00:40:56,979
I was a bit calmer today, sir.

722
00:40:57,312 --> 00:41:00,187
After two days of practice,
I was calm, sir.

723
00:41:00,396 --> 00:41:01,312
He's coming sir.

724
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:03,479
He's coming, sir. Coming, sir.

725
00:41:04,021 --> 00:41:05,062
He comes...

726
00:41:05,437 --> 00:41:07,354
steps right on the dung...

727
00:41:07,604 --> 00:41:09,354
and cursed "shit", sir.

728
00:41:09,854 --> 00:41:12,771
I was wondering what to do next.

729
00:41:13,354 --> 00:41:17,396
He bends down to get rid of the dung
from his shoes.

730
00:41:17,521 --> 00:41:18,729
That's it, sir.

731
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,562
I watched him...

732
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:23,562
I wrapped the kite string on my hands...

733
00:41:23,646 --> 00:41:29,854
flung it over his neck...
and moved it back and forth...

734
00:41:29,979 --> 00:41:31,521
He was screaming, sir!

735
00:41:31,604 --> 00:41:33,979
I saw a couple of people approaching.

736
00:41:34,062 --> 00:41:35,646
I was worried they'd hear
his noise...

737
00:41:40,396 --> 00:41:43,271
Masilamani. Masilamani?

738
00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:48,521
Sir...

739
00:41:49,521 --> 00:41:51,354
The same thing happened
the other day.

740
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:53,354
Early morning...

741
00:41:53,937 --> 00:41:55,562
from a nearby mosque...

742
00:41:56,354 --> 00:41:58,604
I heard "Allah"!

743
00:41:58,979 --> 00:42:00,771
Drowning out this dog's screams...

744
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:03,021
in that sound, sir.

745
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,104
He fell dead in front of me.

746
00:42:06,396 --> 00:42:08,021
I could've been caught red-handed.

747
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:11,896
I took off and ran straight
to that mosque...

748
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:15,187
that's where I prayed
and got this protective locket, sir.

749
00:42:15,604 --> 00:42:18,687
-Lord Allah saved me, sir!
-Allah saved you, huh?

750
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:22,146
Do you realize the police
have arrested you?

751
00:42:22,562 --> 00:42:24,104
What's with that sarcastic laugh?

752
00:42:25,396 --> 00:42:28,437
I somehow feel, it's the police
that are trapped.

753
00:42:28,521 --> 00:42:29,687
Are you mocking us?

754
00:42:30,104 --> 00:42:33,354
The real mockery is that,
highly educated police officers...

755
00:42:33,854 --> 00:42:39,687
are trapped between the criminals,
the law, the rich and the politicians!

756
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:43,687
Only the poor like me are
subjected to God's grace.

757
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,687
The truth is... 'Power' is God!

758
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:50,021
When a man in a powerful position
commits a murder,

759
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:53,937
he just calmly puts his shades on
and walks off, sir.

760
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,687
The police never get a clue
and even if they do...

761
00:42:57,854 --> 00:42:59,354
they'll be quiet. Right, sir?

762
00:42:59,479 --> 00:43:04,521
Rascal! Always... keep
insulting the police!

763
00:43:05,687 --> 00:43:06,937
Stop it, stop it! Venkat!

764
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:07,896
Look at him, sir.

765
00:43:08,021 --> 00:43:09,896
I hit him once. Look at his
exaggerated drama!

766
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:12,854
<i>Oh no... Honey!</i>

767
00:43:13,937 --> 00:43:16,104
<i>Somebody help my husband!</i>

768
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:18,354
<i>Honey? God!</i>

769
00:43:20,896 --> 00:43:22,896
<i>They beat my husband and took the jewels.</i>

770
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:23,937
<i>-Dhanaselvam.</i>
<i>-Sir?</i>

771
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:26,062
Call the Joint Commissioner's office

772
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,562
and see if there's a
psychologist on call now.

773
00:43:29,646 --> 00:43:31,187
Had I finished him off then...

774
00:43:32,187 --> 00:43:33,812
all my problems would've been solved.

775
00:43:34,646 --> 00:43:37,521
That's where I messed up.

776
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:38,687
Masilamani?

777
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:40,854
Masilamani, what's the problem?

778
00:43:40,937 --> 00:43:43,771
Tell us who's responsible for your
problems. We'll take action.

779
00:43:49,271 --> 00:43:50,979
I don't know why.

780
00:43:55,771 --> 00:43:57,896
Tell us, Masilamani.
We'll definitely take action.

781
00:43:58,062 --> 00:43:58,979
Really?

782
00:43:59,854 --> 00:44:02,646
You can't take any action against
the person I'll tell about next.

783
00:44:03,437 --> 00:44:04,437
He is...

784
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:07,062
He's more powerful than all of you.

785
00:44:11,146 --> 00:44:12,937
He was already shot once.

786
00:44:14,521 --> 00:44:15,812
Yet, he didn't die.

787
00:44:17,479 --> 00:44:18,854
When he laughs, I tell you...

788
00:44:19,354 --> 00:44:23,562
A toothless grin is a sight to see.

789
00:44:23,937 --> 00:44:25,771
Ah, Saami sir.

790
00:44:25,979 --> 00:44:28,812
-My wallet?
-It's safe with us.

791
00:44:28,896 --> 00:44:32,354
-That's why I'm worried!
-Gosh! Is there even 100 rupees in it?

792
00:44:33,146 --> 00:44:34,104
Yes.

793
00:44:34,354 --> 00:44:37,771
The one I'd only seen on
100 and 500 rupee bills...

794
00:44:38,646 --> 00:44:41,854
for the first time,
I saw him on a 2000-rupee bill.

795
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:43,062
<i>Masilamani? Here.</i>

796
00:44:43,146 --> 00:44:46,479
A member of the club...
a doctor, tipped me.

797
00:44:47,187 --> 00:44:48,687
I took it and...

798
00:44:49,146 --> 00:44:50,479
gave it to Usha.

799
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,521
<i>Whoa! A 2000-rupee bill!</i>

800
00:44:53,104 --> 00:44:55,187
<i>I have a dress</i>
<i>that has the same color.</i>

801
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:59,729
She hugs me tight,
I hug her tighter...

802
00:44:59,812 --> 00:45:02,646
I kissed her all over her face!

803
00:45:04,479 --> 00:45:06,604
Why this sudden love?

804
00:45:06,854 --> 00:45:10,354
She pressed me to her bosom and...

805
00:45:16,354 --> 00:45:20,187
"Each kiss of yours is worth ten million!"

806
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:24,104
<i>Yeah! You're showing me</i>
<i>a 2000-rupee bill now.</i>

807
00:45:24,771 --> 00:45:25,979
<i>Ten million, huh?</i>

808
00:45:26,062 --> 00:45:28,312
<i>All of this is for</i>
<i>the toothless old man!</i>

809
00:45:28,396 --> 00:45:29,437
<i>Not for you!</i>

810
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:36,062
-Wake him up!
-I wish I'd worked harder, kept her happy.

811
00:45:36,146 --> 00:45:38,271
-Masilamani? Get up!
-I wonder how.

812
00:45:38,354 --> 00:45:40,604
You know where you are?

813
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:43,146
I said, get up! Up!

814
00:45:44,062 --> 00:45:46,021
I'm a loser, sir!

815
00:45:46,312 --> 00:45:47,312
Loser.

816
00:45:47,396 --> 00:45:51,187
If a candy colored bill ruins my life...

817
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:53,687
who will I be mad at?
Tell me.

818
00:45:53,771 --> 00:45:57,187
He's the one to blame.
He indulged and spoilt my wife!

819
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:59,604
Hey! How dare you break Gandhi's photo?

820
00:45:59,771 --> 00:46:03,146
Venkat? Forget the case!
I'll beat you to pulp right now!

821
00:46:03,229 --> 00:46:06,312
Please bash him up, sir.
And finish him off for good.

822
00:46:06,562 --> 00:46:09,854
I didn't hit Gandhi!
I know he's a Mahatma...

823
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,771
But he is on that bill!

824
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:14,896
Those who have none
hate those who have plenty, sir.

825
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:18,521
That anger, the desperation,
the envy... That's what it was!

826
00:46:18,979 --> 00:46:19,937
Forget it, sir.

827
00:46:20,396 --> 00:46:22,271
Let's burn down all the money out there.

828
00:46:22,562 --> 00:46:23,979
Let's restart from zero again.

829
00:46:24,062 --> 00:46:26,771
We'll both work hard and earn a living.
Let's see then!

830
00:46:27,437 --> 00:46:29,771
Everyone should be born naked.

831
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:33,521
Why are some wrapped in a loincloth
while some are swathed in money?

832
00:46:34,187 --> 00:46:36,479
So what about people like me?

833
00:46:36,854 --> 00:46:40,187
Shame... shamed...
can't tolerate shame...

834
00:46:41,396 --> 00:46:43,229
This keeps beeping over and over!

835
00:46:47,146 --> 00:46:51,396
A DC, an AC and an inspector are
in the middle of an interrogation here.

836
00:46:51,479 --> 00:46:54,604
-Saami, take that walkie-talkie from him.
-Thought, I'd... here, sir.

837
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,312
Glass shards are all over the place.

838
00:46:57,437 --> 00:47:01,229
The JC's office called.
They're sending Dr Surya.

839
00:47:01,312 --> 00:47:02,354
This wound too.

840
00:47:02,646 --> 00:47:05,229
Need to remove these stitches.
It's been 10 days.

841
00:47:06,396 --> 00:47:07,354
Masilamani.

842
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,604
Sorry, we didn't realize your
mental state and disturbed you.

843
00:47:10,687 --> 00:47:12,646
Take rest. Let's start afresh
in the morning.

844
00:47:12,854 --> 00:47:14,187
<i>-Saami, clean up here.</i>
-Sir?

845
00:47:14,312 --> 00:47:15,562
-Remove the camera.
-OK, sir.

846
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:16,646
<i>-Dhanaselvam...</i>
<i>-Sir?</i>

847
00:47:16,729 --> 00:47:18,896
...tell the Commissioner
that we'll continue tomorrow.

848
00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:21,937
Let them take everything.
Ask them to leave the camera behind.

849
00:47:22,021 --> 00:47:25,729
Because I'll record any
details I missed...

850
00:47:25,812 --> 00:47:27,271
-with the camera.
-Change the memory card.

851
00:47:27,354 --> 00:47:32,187
I'll be nervous when I see all of you
and I'm unable to speak properly.

852
00:47:32,271 --> 00:47:33,187
You? Really?

853
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,729
DC sir, my Mahesh?

854
00:47:38,812 --> 00:47:42,146
Don't worry. They'll put him in
Rosie's room. She'll look after him.

855
00:47:42,229 --> 00:47:44,646
Ask her to take good care of him, sir.

856
00:47:45,271 --> 00:47:47,146
The one in the front
is the "On" button, right?

857
00:47:47,229 --> 00:47:50,396
-Yes.
-Oh! OK. I knew that.

858
00:47:50,646 --> 00:47:53,021
-Saami sir! Just a minute!
-Tell me, I'm right here!

859
00:47:53,646 --> 00:47:57,396
Please buy Mahesh a pizza for dinner.
He's been asking for a long time.

860
00:47:57,479 --> 00:47:59,729
Ensure there's cheese all over.

861
00:48:00,021 --> 00:48:02,437
-And an orange juice without ice.
-OK.

862
00:48:02,521 --> 00:48:05,104
After dinner, give him his medicines...

863
00:48:05,187 --> 00:48:08,604
-and put eye drops in his left eye.
-OK.

864
00:48:08,729 --> 00:48:12,479
Please tell him, daddy's been selected
in the police interview...

865
00:48:13,104 --> 00:48:17,229
and I have to do
target practice all night.

866
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:21,396
He loves the Power Rangers.
Tell him daddy's a Power Ranger now...

867
00:48:21,479 --> 00:48:25,604
and he'll shoot down criminals.
Bam! Bam!

868
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:27,437
He'll be happy to hear it.

869
00:48:29,104 --> 00:48:32,187
Please don't light up mosquito coils
like you did it in here.

870
00:48:32,312 --> 00:48:35,021
The smoke will make him breathless.

871
00:48:35,104 --> 00:48:38,271
I've already warned you about the
consequences of his breathing problem.

872
00:48:40,062 --> 00:48:42,604
Use one of these electric repellents.

873
00:48:43,479 --> 00:48:44,771
And...

874
00:48:44,854 --> 00:48:46,646
<i>You've shut the door, huh!</i>

875
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:48,937
<i>-Saami sir, can you hear me?</i>
<i>-Yes, I can.</i>

876
00:48:49,021 --> 00:48:51,229
<i>-Tell me.</i>
<i>-Hear me out as you lock the door.</i>

877
00:48:51,312 --> 00:48:53,521
<i>He'll have to pee a</i>
<i>couple of times at night.</i>

878
00:48:53,604 --> 00:48:58,062
<i>Ask Rosie to wrap him</i>
<i>in a blanket and put him to bed.</i>

879
00:48:58,354 --> 00:48:59,604
<i>That...</i>

880
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,979
<i>I'll let you know</i>
<i>if there's anything else, okay?</i>

881
00:49:03,104 --> 00:49:05,396
<i>Last night, the kid was very serious.</i>

882
00:49:05,521 --> 00:49:07,104
<i>We just brought him from the hospital.</i>

883
00:49:07,187 --> 00:49:08,896
<i>He keeps calling out for Masi.</i>

884
00:49:09,021 --> 00:49:10,604
<i>It's the children who suffer...</i>

885
00:49:11,604 --> 00:49:13,396
<i>the consequences of their</i>
<i>parents' actions.</i>

886
00:49:18,812 --> 00:49:22,646
Your son wanted us to give you this toy.
I'm leaving it here.

887
00:49:22,729 --> 00:49:24,979
Masilamani? What are you doing there?

888
00:49:25,687 --> 00:49:30,646
When I heard of Dr Surya,
I thought it was a man.

889
00:49:30,771 --> 00:49:35,187
I wasn't expecting
a woman "psychologist".

890
00:49:37,312 --> 00:49:39,896
How did you know
that I'm a psychologist?

891
00:49:40,479 --> 00:49:43,812
-I've seen you. Even spoke to you!
-You've spoken to me, huh?

892
00:49:43,937 --> 00:49:46,396
-You come on a "Doctor Show" on TV, right?
-Yes.

893
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:49,187
I was a caller by the name,
'Royapuram Ramesh'.

894
00:49:49,396 --> 00:49:51,896
-Regarding what problem?
-I'm unable to sleep, doctor.

895
00:49:52,312 --> 00:49:53,312
Since when?

896
00:49:53,646 --> 00:49:55,812
That... is for many years.

897
00:49:56,479 --> 00:50:00,062
But for the last 10-11 days,
I haven't slept at all.

898
00:50:00,396 --> 00:50:02,812
What do you do all night
if you can't sleep?

899
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:03,937
I stay awake.

900
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:05,312
Good joke!

901
00:50:05,521 --> 00:50:06,937
Then you must laugh!

902
00:50:07,021 --> 00:50:10,979
You should see Mahesh laugh!
I learned all the jokes for him.

903
00:50:11,854 --> 00:50:15,812
It's better for bonds to break away
than wilt slowly.

904
00:50:18,146 --> 00:50:21,521
Some bonds die while
still being alive...

905
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:25,021
while some others live forever

906
00:50:25,771 --> 00:50:29,271
even when long gone.

907
00:50:29,354 --> 00:50:30,354
If that...

908
00:50:30,896 --> 00:50:32,396
If that's the way it is...

909
00:50:33,396 --> 00:50:35,062
what can one do but smile?

910
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:38,687
Since when did you
start talking randomly?

911
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:44,854
Since the start of the affair...

912
00:50:44,937 --> 00:50:47,146
<i>It's no affair, honey.</i>

913
00:50:49,812 --> 00:50:50,812
Masilamani?

914
00:50:52,771 --> 00:50:54,521
Why couldn't you tell me that?

915
00:50:54,729 --> 00:50:55,604
Masilamani?

916
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:57,896
Why don't you tell me that?

917
00:50:59,146 --> 00:51:00,979
Without consulting me...

918
00:51:01,729 --> 00:51:03,687
if you take all decisions, then...

919
00:51:04,021 --> 00:51:07,896
-what am I here for... I...
-Who are you talking about?

920
00:51:10,437 --> 00:51:13,271
If I say I was talking about Usha,
you'd ask, "Who is Usha?"

921
00:51:13,854 --> 00:51:15,062
One must be alert, right?

922
00:51:15,479 --> 00:51:17,021
Usha is your beautiful wife.

923
00:51:24,562 --> 00:51:26,979
-You know that she's beautiful?
-Oh Yeah!

924
00:51:27,062 --> 00:51:29,021
Including the fact
that she's a fan of Ilayaraja.

925
00:51:29,104 --> 00:51:31,146
I saw your complete video yesterday.

926
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:34,646
-You've understood me completely?
-No, just half of it.

927
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:36,771
I'll try to understand
the rest while we're talking.

928
00:51:37,104 --> 00:51:40,354
Did they ask you to talk to me
and check if I'm telling the truth?

929
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:41,979
I'm not a lie detector.

930
00:51:42,062 --> 00:51:45,812
-I'm here to see how I can help you.
-Is this your chief doctor?

931
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:48,021
No, he's Mozart.

932
00:51:48,146 --> 00:51:49,562
The world famous music composer.

933
00:52:04,187 --> 00:52:05,146
Wow!

934
00:52:15,354 --> 00:52:16,437
He's a great man!

935
00:52:17,479 --> 00:52:18,562
He makes you...

936
00:52:25,187 --> 00:52:28,187
Sorry, you were asking me something.

937
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:32,937
Tell me about yourself, your parents...
when did you get married?

938
00:52:33,312 --> 00:52:34,646
What grade is Mahesh in?

939
00:52:34,854 --> 00:52:37,687
What do you like?
Tell me... what's your favorite flower?

940
00:52:38,104 --> 00:52:39,104
The banana flower.

941
00:52:39,729 --> 00:52:41,104
What does this tell you?

942
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:44,146
-You're not a fan of fragrance.
-What do you mean?

943
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:45,437
-Is it about my marriage?
-No.

944
00:52:45,521 --> 00:52:49,687
You prefer things that don't give out
fragrance over the aromatic ones.

945
00:52:49,771 --> 00:52:51,062
What's a banana flower?

946
00:52:51,187 --> 00:52:53,396
You say banana flowers aren't fragrant...

947
00:52:53,562 --> 00:52:56,062
but Usha makes these fritters
with them. Wow!

948
00:52:56,146 --> 00:53:01,729
With coriander and mint shreds.
And bits of crunchy fried dal...

949
00:53:03,271 --> 00:53:04,229
Just "wow!".

950
00:53:04,521 --> 00:53:06,562
I gobble a dozen of them.

951
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,479
If there's freshly ground coconut
chutney, it'll be another half a dozen!

952
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:13,146
You love your wife's cooking.

953
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:15,771
I love my wife!

954
00:53:17,896 --> 00:53:19,771
I have no idea how much I love her.

955
00:53:20,354 --> 00:53:21,771
How should she know?

956
00:53:21,937 --> 00:53:24,521
Do you lend a hand when she cooks?

957
00:53:24,854 --> 00:53:28,229
A hand? I lend my entire self to her.

958
00:53:28,437 --> 00:53:29,396
She...

959
00:53:29,604 --> 00:53:35,604
As the oil in the frying pan heats up,
she flattens the batter.

960
00:53:35,687 --> 00:53:38,312
I approach her from behind...

961
00:53:39,479 --> 00:53:41,562
and lean against her back...

962
00:53:41,646 --> 00:53:46,687
I open the petals of the
banana flower, one by one...

963
00:53:46,896 --> 00:53:49,187
and make it look like a bouquet.

964
00:53:50,562 --> 00:53:56,271
Since she's by the fire, she'd have
sweat beads here and there...

965
00:53:56,354 --> 00:54:02,521
I use the banana bouquet to gently dab
and wipe off the sweat...

966
00:54:02,604 --> 00:54:04,854
She'd feel... ticklish.

967
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:11,146
-She can't handle it and she screams.
<i>-Hey, fire here, be quiet.</i>

968
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:16,187
As we fall down and roll around,
we make a giant mess.

969
00:54:16,604 --> 00:54:18,979
After that... we did...

970
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:25,271
Such houses don't have
a separate bedroom and a kitchen.

971
00:54:26,687 --> 00:54:27,771
So...

972
00:54:28,021 --> 00:54:31,687
She suddenly runs to check on
the fritters and they'd be burnt.

973
00:54:31,854 --> 00:54:35,729
She pretends to be angry,
and is glaring at me...

974
00:54:36,354 --> 00:54:40,562
-she'd smile...
<i>-Rascal! If you do this again...</i>

975
00:54:41,187 --> 00:54:43,354
I'd have goose bumps all over!

976
00:54:43,812 --> 00:54:46,437
I can feel it even now!

977
00:54:47,187 --> 00:54:48,146
That's how...

978
00:54:48,229 --> 00:54:52,854
That's how happy we were
until Mahesh was born in the 8th month.

979
00:54:53,729 --> 00:54:55,479
He didn't cry at all when he was born.

980
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:58,271
But we've been crying ever since.

981
00:54:58,437 --> 00:55:02,937
The doctor said he's terminally ill.
Felt like we were struck by a lightning.

982
00:55:03,854 --> 00:55:06,896
But it was only after
coming to this club...

983
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:09,479
that lightning really struck.

984
00:55:09,896 --> 00:55:11,021
What happened?

985
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:18,062
This is how he'd go and speak
to the birds for no apparent reason.

986
00:55:18,187 --> 00:55:19,896
There is a reason for everything.

987
00:55:23,937 --> 00:55:27,271
They're squeaking like my Mahesh.
High pitched and flippant.

988
00:55:27,354 --> 00:55:29,354
-"Masi", "Masi", he'd say.
-Masilamani?

989
00:55:29,521 --> 00:55:31,354
What exactly happened at the club?

990
00:55:32,104 --> 00:55:35,896
All our problems started with 'Bill'.

991
00:55:36,896 --> 00:55:38,271
Don't you want to know who 'Bill' is?

992
00:55:38,729 --> 00:55:40,271
That is an illicit affair!

993
00:55:40,354 --> 00:55:42,854
-God!
-It's OK, leave it.

994
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:45,062
-I'll get it cleaned.
-Wait, Saami. I got it.

995
00:55:45,521 --> 00:55:50,187
Things turned awry only after
she indulged in illicit affairs.

996
00:55:50,354 --> 00:55:54,187
'Bill' and 'illicit affair'.
You do the math.

997
00:55:54,271 --> 00:55:55,854
You're a cycliogist!

998
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:57,146
I'm a Psychologist!

999
00:55:57,937 --> 00:56:00,187
-Strikelogist...
-Psychologist!

1000
00:56:00,729 --> 00:56:04,021
Sl... Slightologist? No.

1001
00:56:04,271 --> 00:56:05,604
Psychologist.

1002
00:56:05,771 --> 00:56:07,937
-Got it right, didn't I?
-Hello. I said that!

1003
00:56:08,021 --> 00:56:11,146
Who asked you to say it?
Wait, I'll pronounce it correctly.

1004
00:56:11,729 --> 00:56:13,271
-Psychologist!
-Cyclogist!

1005
00:56:13,729 --> 00:56:15,812
Look at that. You're saying it wrong now!

1006
00:56:16,437 --> 00:56:19,521
-Is Masilamani cracking jokes?
-He's such a nice person.

1007
00:56:20,146 --> 00:56:23,312
I haven't seen anyone love his
wife and kids like him.

1008
00:56:23,396 --> 00:56:26,104
We're being pressured to
release the quarry owner.

1009
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:30,229
We struggle to arrest but the officials
pressure us to release the guy!

1010
00:56:30,312 --> 00:56:33,229
And we must obey without a word.
Why arrest anyone then?

1011
00:56:33,854 --> 00:56:36,687
Damn! Did we join the
police force for this?

1012
00:56:42,646 --> 00:56:44,479
I've got the entire report, sir.

1013
00:56:45,271 --> 00:56:47,146
Ma'am, how many kids do you have?

1014
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:48,979
I don't have kids, Masilamani.

1015
00:56:49,937 --> 00:56:53,062
The haves don't have kids!
And the have-nots...

1016
00:56:53,937 --> 00:56:55,354
This is how he keeps confusing us.

1017
00:56:55,437 --> 00:56:58,437
Mr. Venkatesh, he's very kind hearted.
Look at him!

1018
00:56:58,729 --> 00:56:59,687
Whatever.

1019
00:56:59,771 --> 00:57:04,312
-I see a criminal as a criminal!
-Mother bird brought food for her babies.

1020
00:57:04,396 --> 00:57:08,979
She... either took it or stole it.
It's not like she earned it!

1021
00:57:09,229 --> 00:57:13,604
Theft, murders started
only when we started earning and saving.

1022
00:57:13,687 --> 00:57:15,937
Leave that aside. Do you know Dr Ramesh?

1023
00:57:19,062 --> 00:57:20,646
<i>Hey! Let me go!</i>

1024
00:57:20,896 --> 00:57:22,854
<i>I'll pay you anything you want.</i>
<i>Just let me go!</i>

1025
00:57:22,979 --> 00:57:24,937
<i>I'll pay you any...</i>

1026
00:57:26,687 --> 00:57:29,771
He believes money can buy anything.

1027
00:57:30,312 --> 00:57:33,854
My... family doctor. He's like family.

1028
00:57:34,646 --> 00:57:39,479
If Mahesh so much as sneezes,
Usha will run straight to him.

1029
00:57:39,562 --> 00:57:40,646
When did you last see him?

1030
00:57:40,729 --> 00:57:45,104
When... whenever I see him,
he'd look fresh.

1031
00:57:45,187 --> 00:57:47,937
I didn't ask about his looks.
I asked when you last saw him?

1032
00:57:48,187 --> 00:57:51,271
Last time I saw him,
he tipped me with a 2000-rupee bill.

1033
00:57:51,354 --> 00:57:56,021
I gave it to Usha
and things turned a bit ugly...

1034
00:57:56,687 --> 00:58:01,437
-Then I broke Gandhi's photo, remember?
-Saami?

1035
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,771
-What is that noise?
-I'll check, sir.

1036
00:58:03,937 --> 00:58:05,812
That's nothing.

1037
00:58:05,937 --> 00:58:08,854
The cat was really
torturing those birds...

1038
00:58:08,937 --> 00:58:11,854
that's why, when I saw it climbing up
the bathroom tank,

1039
00:58:11,937 --> 00:58:15,687
I grabbed it and threw it in the drum.
With one punch, I made an air hole...

1040
00:58:15,771 --> 00:58:18,604
-for it to stay alive.
-You haven't seen Dr Ramesh since?

1041
00:58:20,646 --> 00:58:23,729
Oh! You're cross-questioning me?

1042
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:26,187
I thought you were just questioning me.

1043
00:58:27,187 --> 00:58:29,062
His wife lives in London.

1044
00:58:29,146 --> 00:58:32,729
Guys at the club said
that he must've moved there.

1045
00:58:32,854 --> 00:58:36,771
-He's might've gone to London.
-Have you ever been there?

1046
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:38,771
-To London?
-To Pondicherry!

1047
00:58:38,896 --> 00:58:42,396
If I haven't been to London,
how could I have gone to Pondicherry?

1048
00:58:43,396 --> 00:58:46,021
-Saami, what's going on there?
-Nothing, sir. It's the cat!

1049
00:58:46,146 --> 00:58:49,271
You've released the bad guy?
That's what you'd do!

1050
00:58:49,354 --> 00:58:52,562
But you leave the poor birds to die.

1051
00:58:52,646 --> 00:58:53,729
This is your signature, right?

1052
00:58:53,812 --> 00:58:55,896
I'm even scared to tell the truth
that it's mine.

1053
00:58:55,979 --> 00:58:57,229
Wonder if you'll believe that!

1054
00:58:57,354 --> 00:59:00,937
On August 13th, you went to Pondicherry,
Kottakuppam Police Station. Is that right?

1055
00:59:01,104 --> 00:59:04,271
That's correct. But Kottakuppam isn't in
Pondicherry. It's in Tamil Nadu.

1056
00:59:04,354 --> 00:59:05,812
On the Pondicherry border.

1057
00:59:05,937 --> 00:59:09,687
When you said Pondicherry,
I got confused, I thought I was lying!

1058
00:59:09,771 --> 00:59:11,687
Hey! Why did you go to
Kottakuppam Station?

1059
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:13,271
Everything is clear here...

1060
00:59:13,687 --> 00:59:16,104
Actually, since it's a photocopy,
it's not that clear.

1061
00:59:16,187 --> 00:59:17,812
So I'll clear it up for you.

1062
00:59:17,896 --> 00:59:20,187
Masilamani? Don't think
of you as very smart.

1063
00:59:20,521 --> 00:59:23,312
On August 13th, the doctor was found
murdered in Pondicherry.

1064
00:59:24,271 --> 00:59:25,271
What?

1065
00:59:25,521 --> 00:59:26,854
The doctor was murdered?

1066
00:59:27,187 --> 00:59:28,729
What are you saying? Who...

1067
00:59:28,854 --> 00:59:31,104
Cut the drama, you imbecile!

1068
00:59:31,562 --> 00:59:33,271
Sir! AC sir.

1069
00:59:33,562 --> 00:59:36,562
If you're nice to me,
I'll be nice to you.

1070
00:59:36,646 --> 00:59:37,604
Or what?

1071
00:59:37,854 --> 00:59:39,354
I'll still be nice!

1072
00:59:42,562 --> 00:59:47,021
Was that you, Ma'am? The way you burst out
laughing, I thought the tap was open...

1073
00:59:47,104 --> 00:59:51,187
-It's been like this since yesterday!
-Hey! You killed the doctor!

1074
00:59:51,312 --> 00:59:54,979
Just because you didn't find the killer,
will you frame me for all the murders?

1075
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:57,854
I shouldn't have let you out last night.

1076
00:59:58,062 --> 01:00:00,396
You start with a grand action plan.

1077
01:00:00,687 --> 01:00:04,229
When I admitted to the Madurai murder
that you couldn't solve...

1078
01:00:04,312 --> 01:00:08,187
why would I refuse the one
that you've solved?

1079
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,812
That's what's confusing to us too!

1080
01:00:10,146 --> 01:00:12,521
Well, it confuses you
if I've done it or not. Correct?

1081
01:00:12,687 --> 01:00:14,146
I'm sure it's you.

1082
01:00:14,562 --> 01:00:17,354
-How are you so sure, sir?
-Masilamani?

1083
01:00:17,771 --> 01:00:21,187
We wouldn't have suspected you
even if you hadn't confessed killing Vasu.

1084
01:00:21,854 --> 01:00:24,687
This murder is exactly like
your other two murders.

1085
01:00:25,187 --> 01:00:28,271
Early morning, Dr Ramesh's neck
was slit with a kite string.

1086
01:00:28,562 --> 01:00:30,521
His male organ was smashed
with a rock.

1087
01:00:30,812 --> 01:00:34,854
Not only that. We've found a size 7
slipper at the three crime scenes.

1088
01:00:34,979 --> 01:00:37,812
-Dhanaselvam, what's his foot size?
-11, sir.

1089
01:00:38,312 --> 01:00:39,646
OK. We'll figure that later.

1090
01:00:40,021 --> 01:00:43,854
Crimes executed in a similar pattern
are called MO in our department.

1091
01:00:43,979 --> 01:00:45,562
That means Method of Operation.

1092
01:00:46,146 --> 01:00:49,021
So, this murder's MO is the same as
your other murders.

1093
01:00:49,104 --> 01:00:52,521
Since you committed those murders,
you must've committed this one!

1094
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:53,896
Is that so?

1095
01:00:54,229 --> 01:00:56,271
Please remember what you just said, sir.

1096
01:00:56,354 --> 01:00:57,812
Don't change it later.

1097
01:00:57,896 --> 01:00:59,896
-Ma'am, you're my witness.
-<i>Tell me.</i>

1098
01:01:00,312 --> 01:01:04,562
Since, the third murder is just like
the other two...

1099
01:01:04,646 --> 01:01:07,812
that means the accused in those
murders is responsible for this too.

1100
01:01:13,771 --> 01:01:15,354
I also murdered the doctor, sir.

1101
01:01:15,437 --> 01:01:17,146
Why are you confessing in installments?

1102
01:01:17,312 --> 01:01:20,687
Not one, not two.
This is the third murder, right?

1103
01:01:20,812 --> 01:01:21,812
No!

1104
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:24,396
This was the second murder.

1105
01:01:25,229 --> 01:01:28,646
The third is my arrest and torture here!

1106
01:01:28,729 --> 01:01:30,479
The first one was in Madurai!

1107
01:01:30,854 --> 01:01:32,771
You know Vasudevan? It's him!

1108
01:01:32,937 --> 01:01:34,146
I killed him first!

1109
01:01:34,771 --> 01:01:36,937
I commit the murders
and you give me the count?

1110
01:01:37,354 --> 01:01:39,604
-I'm not cheating anyone!
<i>-Honey...</i>

1111
01:01:39,687 --> 01:01:43,687
<i>I'm going to my mom's place for two days</i>
<i>and then to a temple and be back.</i>

1112
01:01:44,021 --> 01:01:46,021
<i>Take care of Mahesh, okay?</i>

1113
01:01:46,312 --> 01:01:48,479
I've poured water in the leftover rice.

1114
01:01:48,562 --> 01:01:51,312
<i>-Have it for breakfast.</i>
-That's what she told me and left.

1115
01:01:51,479 --> 01:01:53,646
But Pondicherry Selvam told me...

1116
01:01:53,729 --> 01:01:56,937
Trust me! I saw Usha
at a resort in Pondicherry.

1117
01:01:57,854 --> 01:02:00,146
Not wanting to believe.
I asked rickshaw driver Ameen.

1118
01:02:00,396 --> 01:02:01,896
<i>I swear, bro...</i>

1119
01:02:01,979 --> 01:02:04,562
<i>She got on the bus to the temple.</i>
<i>I dropped her there.</i>

1120
01:02:04,646 --> 01:02:06,271
What should I believe now?

1121
01:02:06,396 --> 01:02:09,771
Masilamani, eat something first. Here.

1122
01:02:12,771 --> 01:02:14,479
Doctor, ask him about Ameen.

1123
01:02:14,562 --> 01:02:15,604
Who is Ameen?

1124
01:02:15,687 --> 01:02:16,979
376 rupees!

1125
01:02:17,562 --> 01:02:20,271
Whoa! I can't have such costly food.

1126
01:02:20,771 --> 01:02:22,687
I'll give it to Mahesh when I get home.

1127
01:02:23,104 --> 01:02:26,479
-Who is Ameen?
-Saami, I heard when she asked.

1128
01:02:26,562 --> 01:02:29,354
You think I'm deaf?
You keep asking who Ameen is...

1129
01:02:29,521 --> 01:02:32,021
Ameen is an auto rickshaw driver
from our area.

1130
01:02:32,104 --> 01:02:36,354
He drops Mahesh to school
or the hospital in an emergency.

1131
01:02:36,437 --> 01:02:40,437
He'd do anything for Usha.
Adores her like a sister.

1132
01:02:40,521 --> 01:02:43,437
-He adores her.
-OK. Sit and eat.

1133
01:02:44,021 --> 01:02:47,854
He called her a sister, but acted like
a pimp and made me shrivel in shame!

1134
01:02:49,604 --> 01:02:51,229
You were saying something... go on.

1135
01:02:52,562 --> 01:02:53,646
I said, go on!

1136
01:02:54,146 --> 01:02:57,812
RMB was the name of that
resort in Pondicherry.

1137
01:02:58,687 --> 01:03:03,437
I went there and hid
behind the compound wall...

1138
01:03:04,021 --> 01:03:07,687
and as I was... waiting...

1139
01:03:08,812 --> 01:03:09,937
Dhanaselvam, sir!

1140
01:03:10,146 --> 01:03:12,354
Dhanaselvam sir, Please turn that off!

1141
01:03:17,562 --> 01:03:20,812
There are already so many noises
in my head! And this...

1142
01:03:22,646 --> 01:03:24,771
I see many cars whirring past me.

1143
01:03:24,854 --> 01:03:27,812
On the other side,
I saw a bus leaving for Chennai.

1144
01:03:27,896 --> 01:03:28,979
I saw a car coming.

1145
01:03:29,062 --> 01:03:33,437
I was confirming that there are no
CCTV cameras anywhere in the area...

1146
01:03:33,562 --> 01:03:35,562
The car stops right in front of me.

1147
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,437
He gets down from the car

1148
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:39,354
and starts talking on his Bluetooth.

1149
01:03:39,437 --> 01:03:41,062
<i>-Tell me, Usha.</i>
-You don't worry...

1150
01:03:41,146 --> 01:03:42,312
<i>You don't worry. Plan...</i>

1151
01:03:42,437 --> 01:03:44,021
There's a contraceptive
pill called "Plan B".

1152
01:03:44,104 --> 01:03:48,854
Get it from my clinic and take it.
You have nothing to worry about.

1153
01:03:48,937 --> 01:03:51,479
Yeah. As a Doctor, I know best!

1154
01:03:52,312 --> 01:03:53,937
Is this what a doctor does?

1155
01:03:54,937 --> 01:03:58,271
He opens the car's trunk
to take out something.

1156
01:03:58,354 --> 01:04:02,062
<i>-I had a strip...</i>
-He leans in, searching. That's when...

1157
01:04:02,396 --> 01:04:04,479
I took the kite string and...

1158
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:07,937
flung it tightly over his neck...

1159
01:04:09,146 --> 01:04:11,187
I'll give you money! Let me go!

1160
01:04:11,271 --> 01:04:13,521
I'll pay you any amount! I'll pay...

1161
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:18,104
When you have money...
a Plan B, C, D...

1162
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,104
This is my Plan E!

1163
01:04:21,854 --> 01:04:23,812
He... falls down.

1164
01:04:25,646 --> 01:04:26,812
That's it.

1165
01:04:27,687 --> 01:04:30,521
I threw a rock on
where I needed to throw.

1166
01:04:33,937 --> 01:04:35,521
He was smashed and died.

1167
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:39,396
Before forgetting, I took the slipper...

1168
01:04:40,812 --> 01:04:44,937
from my shoulder bag and placed it there.

1169
01:04:47,479 --> 01:04:49,687
I walked in darkness...

1170
01:04:50,437 --> 01:04:52,187
since I'd left Mahesh there...

1171
01:04:52,687 --> 01:04:54,687
I went straight to Selvam's house...

1172
01:04:55,479 --> 01:04:57,729
I can't find my child there!

1173
01:04:58,604 --> 01:05:00,396
When I asked about Mahesh...

1174
01:05:00,937 --> 01:05:05,312
Selvam said, "Since you were missing,
he ran out looking for you."

1175
01:05:05,646 --> 01:05:07,021
"Don't know where he went."

1176
01:05:07,729 --> 01:05:09,562
When I heard he was missing...

1177
01:05:10,062 --> 01:05:11,646
I lost all my senses.

1178
01:05:12,229 --> 01:05:13,729
It's bright now...

1179
01:05:14,271 --> 01:05:16,271
but I can't see a thing!

1180
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:21,937
I burst out... crying!

1181
01:05:22,062 --> 01:05:24,312
<i>-The boy was crying...</i>
-The tea shop Nair tells me that...

1182
01:05:24,396 --> 01:05:27,229
"He's at the Kottakuppam Police Station."

1183
01:05:27,646 --> 01:05:29,396
I run there and...

1184
01:05:29,812 --> 01:05:31,854
see that the child is crying.

1185
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:35,562
The statement I signed there
is the one you have.

1186
01:05:37,604 --> 01:05:39,562
Don't worry, Masi... Masi is here.

1187
01:05:42,229 --> 01:05:44,396
If I'd lost him that day...

1188
01:05:45,354 --> 01:05:47,271
you wouldn't have had
any of this trouble.

1189
01:05:47,771 --> 01:05:50,062
I'd have killed myself too.

1190
01:05:53,562 --> 01:05:55,021
-Saami sir?
-Tell me.

1191
01:05:55,104 --> 01:05:56,896
It's 11 o'clock,

1192
01:05:57,104 --> 01:06:00,104
Please get Mahesh a falooda ice cream.

1193
01:06:00,187 --> 01:06:01,479
Without ice cream.

1194
01:06:01,562 --> 01:06:03,104
Without ice cream...

1195
01:06:04,562 --> 01:06:06,604
Hold on! I might've stepped...

1196
01:06:12,062 --> 01:06:13,562
It's okay... you're alright.

1197
01:06:21,646 --> 01:06:23,979
Hope my good karma saves Mahesh.

1198
01:06:24,312 --> 01:06:25,521
What is that, Masilamani?

1199
01:06:27,729 --> 01:06:30,271
A cockroach. I almost stepped on...

1200
01:06:30,521 --> 01:06:33,729
Thank God. If I had squished it...

1201
01:06:33,812 --> 01:06:35,812
I'd have sinned.

1202
01:06:36,021 --> 01:06:38,062
You don't want even
a cockroach to die.

1203
01:06:38,312 --> 01:06:39,896
How did you commit so many murders?

1204
01:06:45,562 --> 01:06:48,187
Did that... betray me?

1205
01:06:48,812 --> 01:06:49,729
DC sir...

1206
01:06:49,896 --> 01:06:53,354
He talks about betrayal.
He smashed the victims' male organs.

1207
01:06:53,521 --> 01:06:55,229
This definitely involves a woman.

1208
01:06:55,437 --> 01:06:57,979
Either, the three victims must have
misbehaved with his wife...

1209
01:06:58,312 --> 01:06:59,687
-or his wife must've...
-Hello!

1210
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:03,771
Is Usha my wife or yours?
You keep on making stuff?

1211
01:07:12,687 --> 01:07:15,187
Back in the village,
you have no idea how she was.

1212
01:07:16,062 --> 01:07:19,271
I should never have brought that
naive girl to this club.

1213
01:07:19,854 --> 01:07:23,937
Enticed by the 8000 rupees salary
and free lodging...

1214
01:07:24,146 --> 01:07:28,562
bringing her to this club was the
reason her mind got messed up.

1215
01:07:29,604 --> 01:07:33,937
Usha is a real beauty! But you know the
wannabe ladies who'd come to the club...

1216
01:07:34,021 --> 01:07:38,146
they would have pockmarked faces
and exaggerated pouts.

1217
01:07:38,229 --> 01:07:42,979
Decked up in diamond necklaces.
And... in those short dresses...

1218
01:07:43,062 --> 01:07:45,812
<i>-What are they called?</i>
-That's a dress. You could say a "frock".

1219
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:49,271
They'd strut about in those.
And she'd keep gawking at them.

1220
01:07:49,354 --> 01:07:51,396
They send those dresses for laundry...

1221
01:07:51,604 --> 01:07:55,437
that... once those dried up,
and since she was desperate...

1222
01:07:55,604 --> 01:07:57,521
she'd try on one of them...

1223
01:07:57,604 --> 01:08:01,146
and when I come home...
she would stand...

1224
01:08:01,229 --> 01:08:03,229
<i>Honey, how do I look?</i>

1225
01:08:04,146 --> 01:08:05,479
"Wow", that's how she looked!

1226
01:08:06,021 --> 01:08:07,187
That's it!

1227
01:08:07,396 --> 01:08:10,062
She pushes me down...

1228
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:13,062
and then... you know what!

1229
01:08:13,396 --> 01:08:17,104
After that, she lays snuggled
next to me...

1230
01:08:17,187 --> 01:08:21,312
<i>Why has God made us so poor, honey?</i>

1231
01:08:21,437 --> 01:08:24,479
<i>Imagine how I'd look in their jewels?</i>

1232
01:08:24,562 --> 01:08:25,729
What can we do?

1233
01:08:26,729 --> 01:08:28,979
God is testing us in this life.

1234
01:08:29,896 --> 01:08:32,729
-May be in the next...
<i>-I don't believe in a next life, honey!</i>

1235
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:35,396
<i>I want to live now.</i>

1236
01:08:40,896 --> 01:08:42,104
I felt that was fair.

1237
01:08:42,187 --> 01:08:47,354
But do you know that those mongrels
had recorded a video of her bathing?

1238
01:08:48,062 --> 01:08:49,187
Even I didn't know.

1239
01:08:49,479 --> 01:08:52,979
And... they started threatening
her with that.

1240
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:58,146
When she refused their advances,
they threatened they'd leak it online.

1241
01:08:58,604 --> 01:08:59,604
That's it.

1242
01:09:00,062 --> 01:09:01,062
She...

1243
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,187
sits down and...

1244
01:09:03,562 --> 01:09:04,729
starts screaming and weeping!

1245
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:08,062
How would I feel!

1246
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,979
How could I do nothing?

1247
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,146
Won't you be furious?

1248
01:09:11,229 --> 01:09:12,396
-That's why I...
-So?

1249
01:09:12,646 --> 01:09:13,979
You would kill them?

1250
01:09:14,062 --> 01:09:15,146
Then what are cops for?

1251
01:09:15,312 --> 01:09:16,521
-To loot...
-How dare you!

1252
01:09:16,604 --> 01:09:18,646
To loot money from the rich
and the lives of the poor!

1253
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:20,812
-Let me show you what we are!
-Patience, Venkatesh. Patience.

1254
01:09:20,896 --> 01:09:22,854
-Let him hit me, sir. He already hit...
-Wait, please wait.

1255
01:09:22,937 --> 01:09:24,479
Let go of me. I'll thrash him...

1256
01:09:24,562 --> 01:09:28,271
I'm already bleeding from
yesterday's beating. Enough!

1257
01:09:28,396 --> 01:09:31,604
Can't be patient like you.
I'm stepping out for some time, sorry!

1258
01:09:34,312 --> 01:09:35,396
-Sir...
-What?

1259
01:09:35,521 --> 01:09:39,146
A minister's brother was also
murdered using the same MO in Salem.

1260
01:09:39,229 --> 01:09:40,562
-So?
-Shall we enquire about it too?

1261
01:09:40,646 --> 01:09:44,646
Hey! Stop irritating!
Ask the Commissioner if you want.

1262
01:09:44,771 --> 01:09:45,646
Sorry, sir.

1263
01:09:45,729 --> 01:09:47,646
-Bring something to eat for him.
-OK, sir.

1264
01:09:48,062 --> 01:09:49,146
Masilamani?

1265
01:09:49,229 --> 01:09:51,396
Did you file a complaint about the
blackmail in the police station?

1266
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:53,896
I did, at the D1 Police Station...

1267
01:09:54,062 --> 01:09:57,021
it's on the left before Kalaivanar hall.
I filed a complaint there...

1268
01:09:57,104 --> 01:09:58,562
-Saami?
-I'll check.

1269
01:09:58,687 --> 01:10:00,812
The head constable there told me...

1270
01:10:00,937 --> 01:10:02,812
"Don't lock horns with the rich.

1271
01:10:03,021 --> 01:10:04,687
Instead relocate to other place."

1272
01:10:04,771 --> 01:10:06,521
I felt he had a point...

1273
01:10:06,604 --> 01:10:09,812
I made calls to my earlier workplaces.

1274
01:10:09,937 --> 01:10:12,646
First, there was a
senior Lawyer Vedachalam...

1275
01:10:12,729 --> 01:10:16,937
When I worked there, I used to see
many lawyers and officers like you.

1276
01:10:17,021 --> 01:10:19,354
That's where I learned a few techniques.

1277
01:10:19,479 --> 01:10:23,646
I gave a small demo
when you asked me to write my statement.

1278
01:10:23,729 --> 01:10:26,021
You spilled coffee on it
and asked me to write it again.

1279
01:10:26,104 --> 01:10:29,646
I gave you a carbon copy!
I learned all that from there.

1280
01:10:29,979 --> 01:10:33,937
Then I worked at actor
Vijay Kumar's house for some time.

1281
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:34,896
He does not say...

1282
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:37,271
-Then at the Minister's house...
-He has a purpose for everything.

1283
01:10:37,354 --> 01:10:38,812
-Were you talking to me, sir?
-No.

1284
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:40,771
Oh! To ma'am. OK, sir.

1285
01:10:40,979 --> 01:10:45,354
I worked at the Minister's house
for about a month.

1286
01:10:45,646 --> 01:10:50,021
My old pal, Sekar was still a guard
at the Minister's house.

1287
01:10:50,187 --> 01:10:52,354
I asked him if I could get a job.

1288
01:10:52,437 --> 01:10:55,937
He said, "There was an
incident two years ago."

1289
01:10:56,312 --> 01:10:59,354
<i>Remember? The next day you came</i>
<i>and asked me about it.</i>

1290
01:11:01,062 --> 01:11:03,812
"They aren't hiring anyone after that."

1291
01:11:04,312 --> 01:11:06,521
<i>They don't want any trouble.</i>

1292
01:11:08,604 --> 01:11:11,854
"They only hire relatives
from their native place."

1293
01:11:12,354 --> 01:11:15,021
<i>They've somehow managed to</i>
<i>keep it a secret so far.</i>

1294
01:11:17,729 --> 01:11:20,604
We couldn't suddenly relocate...

1295
01:11:21,271 --> 01:11:23,437
I endured and continued working there.

1296
01:11:24,521 --> 01:11:28,229
But those men... continued bothering...

1297
01:11:29,229 --> 01:11:30,229
my Usha...

1298
01:11:34,396 --> 01:11:38,646
That's why I murdered those three
in cold blood!

1299
01:11:41,021 --> 01:11:41,937
Did you see?

1300
01:11:43,771 --> 01:11:46,437
The blood is still on my hands.

1301
01:11:47,146 --> 01:11:49,479
No matter how much I wash,
it doesn't go away!

1302
01:11:49,562 --> 01:11:50,646
I understand, Masilamani.

1303
01:11:51,437 --> 01:11:53,521
You did everything for your wife.

1304
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:56,687
You constantly talk about Usha...

1305
01:11:57,312 --> 01:11:58,604
Where is Usha now?

1306
01:11:59,396 --> 01:12:00,271
<i>Honey!</i>

1307
01:12:00,354 --> 01:12:01,979
<i>Find me if you can.</i>

1308
01:12:04,312 --> 01:12:05,646
I don't know where... she went...

1309
01:12:05,729 --> 01:12:08,229
Masilamani, I asked you
where is Usha now?

1310
01:12:10,312 --> 01:12:11,354
She's missing.

1311
01:12:11,854 --> 01:12:12,854
She's missing?

1312
01:12:13,437 --> 01:12:14,646
Since when?

1313
01:12:15,187 --> 01:12:18,229
That is... for 10-11 days.

1314
01:12:18,312 --> 01:12:19,479
-Saami?
-I'll check, sir.

1315
01:12:19,562 --> 01:12:22,687
<i>I searched for her everywhere</i>
<i>until I reached Thiruvannamalai.</i>

1316
01:12:22,812 --> 01:12:25,104
<i>Since her mom's house was in Vandavasi,</i>

1317
01:12:25,312 --> 01:12:27,021
<i>I filed a complaint at both the stations.</i>

1318
01:12:28,187 --> 01:12:29,521
<i>An FIR has been filed, sir.</i>

1319
01:12:33,187 --> 01:12:34,062
Told you!

1320
01:12:34,271 --> 01:12:36,646
Saami sir, I don't know
about the past...

1321
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:39,104
but henceforth,
I'll only speak the truth.

1322
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:41,562
If you were to cross-check
that every single time,

1323
01:12:41,646 --> 01:12:44,479
you won't just get tired,
you'll be retired!

1324
01:12:44,562 --> 01:12:45,562
Masilamani?

1325
01:12:45,896 --> 01:12:47,854
How old is your wife?

1326
01:12:48,396 --> 01:12:51,271
No one can say... she's 32.

1327
01:12:52,062 --> 01:12:53,896
-Dhanaselvam?
<i>-Will check, sir.</i>

1328
01:12:59,687 --> 01:13:01,312
Sir, look at this photo.

1329
01:13:04,562 --> 01:13:07,104
Masilamani, these are our
routine formalities.

1330
01:13:07,854 --> 01:13:09,896
This photo is from the
government hospital mortuary.

1331
01:13:10,187 --> 01:13:11,562
Check if this is your wife?

1332
01:13:15,146 --> 01:13:16,562
Look at it and then tell me.

1333
01:13:22,729 --> 01:13:24,646
Don't look at me.
Look at the phone!

1334
01:13:26,729 --> 01:13:28,521
That is Usha.

1335
01:13:30,062 --> 01:13:30,937
On that day...

1336
01:13:31,354 --> 01:13:33,104
she was wearing a red dress.

1337
01:13:33,229 --> 01:13:35,687
You knew your wife was in the mortuary?

1338
01:13:39,146 --> 01:13:40,854
Why did you file a missing
complaint then?

1339
01:13:44,271 --> 01:13:46,271
When I filed the complaint,
she was really missing.

1340
01:13:46,687 --> 01:13:47,562
That was back then!

1341
01:13:47,896 --> 01:13:50,146
Why didn't you tell us until
we found out about this?

1342
01:13:52,396 --> 01:13:53,479
Here.

1343
01:13:54,187 --> 01:13:55,104
So...

1344
01:13:55,437 --> 01:13:58,146
You killed your wife
and staged a drama?

1345
01:13:58,562 --> 01:13:59,646
Isn't that true?

1346
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:03,479
Why should your guess be right?

1347
01:14:04,146 --> 01:14:05,729
It's my statement that should be true!

1348
01:14:06,187 --> 01:14:10,312
He planned his wife's murder
and made it look like an accident.

1349
01:14:12,104 --> 01:14:13,646
Yes! It was me!

1350
01:14:13,729 --> 01:14:14,854
-Masilamani.
-It was me!

1351
01:14:14,937 --> 01:14:17,646
It was I who killed... slaughtered...

1352
01:14:17,729 --> 01:14:19,229
-and murdered her!
-<i>Masilamani? Relax, be quiet.</i>

1353
01:14:19,687 --> 01:14:20,937
-Is that enough?
-Why raise your voice?

1354
01:14:21,021 --> 01:14:22,062
-Isn't that the truth?
-Venkat?

1355
01:14:22,146 --> 01:14:23,521
Please don't get tense.

1356
01:14:24,729 --> 01:14:28,062
I'm very certain you couldn't
have killed your wife.

1357
01:14:29,521 --> 01:14:31,521
Tell us... what happened?

1358
01:14:33,896 --> 01:14:35,104
You're a godsend!

1359
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:39,521
These guys... only read
my mouth when I speak.

1360
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:43,646
But you look into my eyes
and read my mind.

1361
01:14:45,604 --> 01:14:48,271
If only I knew how to read minds...

1362
01:14:48,896 --> 01:14:51,229
I would've known what Usha wanted...

1363
01:14:51,729 --> 01:14:53,396
and gone far away with my child.

1364
01:14:55,562 --> 01:14:56,521
Like this...

1365
01:14:59,104 --> 01:15:03,104
I wouldn't have to leave my boy
out there and suffer like this.

1366
01:15:06,604 --> 01:15:07,771
I killed...

1367
01:15:09,687 --> 01:15:10,771
my Usha, huh!

1368
01:15:11,312 --> 01:15:12,687
Usha is...

1369
01:15:14,396 --> 01:15:16,146
Mahesh's mother.

1370
01:15:16,687 --> 01:15:18,562
How could anyone kill a mother?

1371
01:15:21,104 --> 01:15:25,979
And they've brought out sticks, guns,
as if they witnessed it!

1372
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:27,187
I'm going to beat him to pulp!

1373
01:15:30,437 --> 01:15:33,521
Masilamani, I'm saying this
for your benefit.

1374
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,479
Just tell us what really happened.

1375
01:15:47,479 --> 01:15:49,021
I've never seen my dad.

1376
01:15:50,187 --> 01:15:52,062
They say I'm like my mom.

1377
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:54,979
My mom isn't very pretty.

1378
01:15:56,396 --> 01:15:57,771
She's short and dark...

1379
01:15:58,187 --> 01:15:59,646
with a flat nose.

1380
01:16:00,729 --> 01:16:03,771
Mothers don't... need to be pretty.

1381
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:07,146
She took me along to see the bride.

1382
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:11,604
She appeared like a
doll made of sandalwood.

1383
01:16:12,687 --> 01:16:14,271
The moment I saw her...

1384
01:16:14,771 --> 01:16:15,979
I was awestruck!

1385
01:16:16,562 --> 01:16:19,604
It wasn't a big deal that
I agreed to marry her.

1386
01:16:19,979 --> 01:16:21,729
But she agreed to marry me...

1387
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:23,812
was the quire of fate.

1388
01:16:24,354 --> 01:16:25,646
What should I have done?

1389
01:16:26,187 --> 01:16:28,729
"Oh! I don't deserve you...

1390
01:16:29,062 --> 01:16:32,562
I can sleep on a foam pillow.
How can I sleep if it's gold?"

1391
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:35,437
I should've said, "No, thank you"
and left.

1392
01:16:37,021 --> 01:16:41,062
How would a beggar feel winning
a jackpot with a single lottery ticket?

1393
01:16:41,562 --> 01:16:45,271
I agreed to marry her in that excitement.

1394
01:16:45,771 --> 01:16:47,021
It was a blunder.

1395
01:16:47,354 --> 01:16:49,354
A bigger blunder was...

1396
01:16:49,854 --> 01:16:51,521
bringing her to this club.

1397
01:16:51,687 --> 01:16:53,896
Remember, I kept telling you...

1398
01:16:53,979 --> 01:16:58,396
She'd yearn for all the riches looking
at the ladies at the club.

1399
01:16:58,562 --> 01:17:04,771
When the tender meat is hung...
in the meat shops...

1400
01:17:05,104 --> 01:17:10,562
and you see the dogs salivate
for some meat pieces?

1401
01:17:10,646 --> 01:17:13,437
The rabid dogs at the club
were just like these dogs.

1402
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,521
They used my poverty against me.

1403
01:17:17,104 --> 01:17:18,562
When I noticed one day...

1404
01:17:19,562 --> 01:17:22,979
that Usha had Mahesh in one hand
and a cell phone in the other.

1405
01:17:23,687 --> 01:17:25,354
I asked her where she got it.

1406
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:27,771
She said the club secretary's wife
gave it to her.

1407
01:17:28,146 --> 01:17:30,396
I couldn't believe it.

1408
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,854
Later, I hear people gossip...

1409
01:17:33,896 --> 01:17:38,437
that something was going on
between the secretary and Usha.

1410
01:17:38,729 --> 01:17:42,271
I felt awkward when I heard that.

1411
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:46,396
If I falsely accuse her
and if her heart breaks...

1412
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:49,604
and if she takes an extreme step...

1413
01:17:49,854 --> 01:17:51,271
So I stayed quiet.

1414
01:17:52,271 --> 01:17:53,437
Later, I find out...

1415
01:17:54,479 --> 01:17:57,062
it's not just the secretary...

1416
01:17:57,521 --> 01:18:00,312
the doctor, the real estate owner...

1417
01:18:03,396 --> 01:18:06,021
It's disgusting to even talk about it.

1418
01:18:07,146 --> 01:18:12,521
Then one day, when I open the cupboard
to get my torch light...

1419
01:18:13,396 --> 01:18:16,979
I find some jewels and
a wad of 2000-rupee bills.

1420
01:18:18,187 --> 01:18:24,646
OK. I figured she's got all that
by sleeping around...

1421
01:18:25,354 --> 01:18:28,146
I was furious and raging mad!

1422
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:30,646
What would any man in my place do?

1423
01:18:31,062 --> 01:18:35,187
Chop his wife's head
and bring it to the police station.

1424
01:18:35,562 --> 01:18:37,271
Twirling his moustache with machismo.

1425
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:39,687
But I can't do that, can I?

1426
01:18:40,312 --> 01:18:41,729
Usha was my life.

1427
01:18:42,896 --> 01:18:44,521
I thought I'd end my life...

1428
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,562
I tie her sari...

1429
01:18:47,187 --> 01:18:49,354
around my neck
to hang myself to death.

1430
01:18:49,646 --> 01:18:51,646
But she finds me
and falls at my feet...

1431
01:18:51,729 --> 01:18:56,646
<i>Oh no! Please...</i>
<i>Don't do it, honey. Listen to me.</i>

1432
01:18:56,729 --> 01:19:00,812
<i>-I messed up. Forgive me, honey!</i>
-No! No, Let me die!

1433
01:19:01,062 --> 01:19:03,729
I'll go. At least take care of Mahesh.

1434
01:19:03,812 --> 01:19:08,521
<i>I only did this for our Mahesh, honey.</i>
<i>For his medical expenses.</i>

1435
01:19:09,562 --> 01:19:14,271
<i>I hoped we can get him treated abroad.</i>
<i>That's why I did this.</i>

1436
01:19:17,521 --> 01:19:20,562
<i>Given our situation, I didn't know</i>
<i>what else to do, honey.</i>

1437
01:19:21,021 --> 01:19:22,854
When she mentioned Mahesh...

1438
01:19:25,146 --> 01:19:26,646
I melted.

1439
01:19:27,812 --> 01:19:28,937
What could I do?

1440
01:19:30,937 --> 01:19:34,271
Then I told her, "We don't need this.

1441
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:40,104
Instead of Mahesh living to a 100,
in disgust and humiliation,

1442
01:19:40,479 --> 01:19:45,354
let's keep him alive as long as
possible with dignity and integrity."

1443
01:19:45,812 --> 01:19:47,062
I said, "If he dies,

1444
01:19:47,812 --> 01:19:50,812
let's die with him."

1445
01:19:52,729 --> 01:19:55,229
She calmed down and agreed with me.

1446
01:19:57,896 --> 01:19:59,062
Later, I find that...

1447
01:19:59,604 --> 01:20:04,229
it's again... she's continuing it.

1448
01:20:04,937 --> 01:20:09,271
I lost control and kept hitting her!

1449
01:20:09,354 --> 01:20:10,937
Then she says... "No, honey...

1450
01:20:11,062 --> 01:20:15,479
They've recorded videos
of me with them...

1451
01:20:15,562 --> 01:20:17,062
and they blackmailed me..."

1452
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:19,146
Then, I told you, right?

1453
01:20:19,687 --> 01:20:21,854
That's when I filed a complaint

1454
01:20:21,937 --> 01:20:24,687
and the constable asked me relocate...

1455
01:20:24,771 --> 01:20:26,729
and then Vedachalam, the Minister...

1456
01:20:27,396 --> 01:20:28,437
and all that.

1457
01:20:28,562 --> 01:20:31,687
Realizing that the rich and powerful...

1458
01:20:32,562 --> 01:20:36,646
get no punishment for their
crimes in this country...

1459
01:20:37,021 --> 01:20:39,021
I slit their throats...

1460
01:20:42,896 --> 01:20:44,771
Masilamani, calm down.

1461
01:20:45,062 --> 01:20:47,104
I understand your pain.

1462
01:20:49,979 --> 01:20:51,396
-It's missing.
-What?

1463
01:20:51,729 --> 01:20:55,187
I hid it in the BCC Club's motor room.

1464
01:20:55,437 --> 01:20:58,021
I leave a single slipper
at every murder, right?

1465
01:20:58,271 --> 01:21:02,187
I put the other slippers from the pairs
in a plastic bag and hid it there.

1466
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:06,021
If that's missing,
Usha must've sniffed me out.

1467
01:21:07,187 --> 01:21:10,437
I thought I'd ask her,
but she goes missing the next day.

1468
01:21:10,521 --> 01:21:12,604
That's when I filed
the missing complaint.

1469
01:21:12,687 --> 01:21:16,604
Three days later, she shows up
at the doorstep in a yellow sari.

1470
01:21:17,229 --> 01:21:18,771
Her cheeks are bruised.

1471
01:21:18,854 --> 01:21:22,271
Before I could ask her, she says,
"As penance for my sins,

1472
01:21:22,354 --> 01:21:25,354
I went to the temple and
pierced my cheeks with spears."

1473
01:21:25,437 --> 01:21:27,604
I asked her, "Didn't it hurt"?

1474
01:21:27,729 --> 01:21:29,687
<i>Not as much as I hurt you, honey.</i>

1475
01:21:32,062 --> 01:21:33,187
That's it.

1476
01:21:33,729 --> 01:21:34,854
She fell at my feet.

1477
01:21:35,354 --> 01:21:36,396
Hugged me tight.

1478
01:21:37,437 --> 01:21:39,354
I melted. That's how I am!

1479
01:21:41,812 --> 01:21:44,396
That day, she convinced
that her body was soiled...

1480
01:21:44,729 --> 01:21:47,854
but her heart was always mine.

1481
01:21:48,646 --> 01:21:53,354
Then... that evening, she's all
decked up with jasmine flowers...

1482
01:21:53,771 --> 01:21:57,437
and asks, "Shall we go to the beach?".
Before I could answer, our son...

1483
01:21:57,521 --> 01:22:01,146
is ready with his kite and says,
"Come, Masi. Come. Let's go!"

1484
01:22:01,562 --> 01:22:05,187
Then... praying that life should
be peaceful at least from now on...

1485
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:06,604
I went to the beach with them.

1486
01:22:06,687 --> 01:22:10,812
There, Mahesh found a group to play
with and went away with them.

1487
01:22:11,562 --> 01:22:18,521
Usha takes a cloth, blindfolds me
and spins me around...

1488
01:22:18,771 --> 01:22:21,729
<i>Honey, find me if you can.</i>

1489
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:22,937
She asks me to find her.

1490
01:22:23,021 --> 01:22:26,771
Playing hide-and-seek on the beach
seemed childish.

1491
01:22:27,021 --> 01:22:29,937
But it was still fun.

1492
01:22:31,062 --> 01:22:33,937
The cloth she tied was
some slippery nylon fabric...

1493
01:22:34,146 --> 01:22:36,187
it slid down on one side.

1494
01:22:36,479 --> 01:22:39,187
I sneaked a peek.

1495
01:22:40,062 --> 01:22:42,729
She was signaling someone.

1496
01:22:43,146 --> 01:22:44,562
When I turned around...

1497
01:22:44,812 --> 01:22:47,396
The rickshaw driver was pulling out a log.

1498
01:22:47,521 --> 01:22:50,021
And when I looked at her
and turned around

1499
01:22:50,104 --> 01:22:51,229
and before I could fathom...

1500
01:22:53,229 --> 01:22:56,021
I thought he was bluffing.
But he has really experienced pain.

1501
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,021
I get up again...

1502
01:22:58,187 --> 01:22:59,562
he hits me again!

1503
01:23:00,896 --> 01:23:05,187
If it continued, he would've killed me,
so I played dead.

1504
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,271
<i>Looks like he's dead. Give it, quick!</i>

1505
01:23:07,354 --> 01:23:09,104
<i>I'm scared... All the jewels, huh?</i>

1506
01:23:09,187 --> 01:23:10,021
<i>-I look up.</i>
-Can I get...

1507
01:23:10,146 --> 01:23:14,021
She was giving the driver
all her jewelry...

1508
01:23:14,271 --> 01:23:17,187
She screams, "Oh no!
He's beating up my husband!"

1509
01:23:17,271 --> 01:23:19,812
"He's running away with my jewels!".

1510
01:23:19,937 --> 01:23:21,896
<i>He's running away with my jewels!".</i>

1511
01:23:21,979 --> 01:23:23,354
I was dumbstruck!

1512
01:23:24,187 --> 01:23:25,562
"I did it for Mahesh...

1513
01:23:26,562 --> 01:23:27,854
They blackmailed me."

1514
01:23:29,187 --> 01:23:30,479
Was it all a lie?

1515
01:23:31,396 --> 01:23:32,312
She...

1516
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:35,479
I even forgave her for betraying me.

1517
01:23:36,021 --> 01:23:39,396
But to think she'll have
someone kill me...

1518
01:23:40,812 --> 01:23:42,187
I could never have imagined it!

1519
01:23:42,521 --> 01:23:46,729
Filled with furiousness,
I chase that rickshaw driver...

1520
01:23:47,146 --> 01:23:50,687
and I see her running the other way.

1521
01:23:50,812 --> 01:23:52,937
I leave him
and start chasing her...

1522
01:23:53,021 --> 01:23:56,312
She runs hard, looking at me
back-and-forth, crosses the road and...

1523
01:23:57,896 --> 01:24:00,187
<i>God! Hey! Come on...</i>

1524
01:24:00,396 --> 01:24:04,354
The vehicle's tire runs over
her pretty face.

1525
01:24:06,021 --> 01:24:08,479
So much blood... blood everywhere.

1526
01:24:09,396 --> 01:24:10,646
People gather around...

1527
01:24:12,021 --> 01:24:13,646
I merge with the crowd...

1528
01:24:14,312 --> 01:24:15,646
and look at the vehicle.

1529
01:24:15,979 --> 01:24:21,104
It's a vehicle
that brings cash to ATMs.

1530
01:24:24,896 --> 01:24:26,521
<i>-Masi? Leave me.</i>
-I panic and run.

1531
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:29,104
I saw Mahesh crying instead of me.

1532
01:24:29,271 --> 01:24:30,979
I asked him what happened...

1533
01:24:31,312 --> 01:24:32,771
and he shows me his kite.

1534
01:24:32,854 --> 01:24:34,229
<i>Masi?</i>

1535
01:24:34,896 --> 01:24:37,896
-He says it's torn.
<i>-I want a new kite...</i>

1536
01:24:45,479 --> 01:24:46,479
Masilamani?

1537
01:24:46,896 --> 01:24:48,729
Please gather yourself.

1538
01:24:49,021 --> 01:24:50,771
These interrogations can wait.

1539
01:24:51,187 --> 01:24:55,104
Attend to your wife's last rites first.

1540
01:24:56,146 --> 01:24:59,229
Today is the 10th day.
I should've performed her last rites.

1541
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:03,479
The moment she decided to kill me...

1542
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:06,604
she was dead to me
and I burnt all traces of her...

1543
01:25:07,396 --> 01:25:08,729
from my heart.

1544
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,646
Today is the last date.

1545
01:25:11,021 --> 01:25:13,271
If nobody claims the body,
they'll bury it.

1546
01:25:14,104 --> 01:25:16,521
Mahesh should not know
about his mom's death.

1547
01:25:17,062 --> 01:25:20,687
You can carry on with your formalities.

1548
01:25:21,021 --> 01:25:24,104
Masilamani, you may have thousands
of issues, but she was still your wife.

1549
01:25:26,146 --> 01:25:28,062
The issue was, I had only thousands.

1550
01:25:28,562 --> 01:25:31,687
If I'd had millions,
she'd still be my wife.

1551
01:25:32,521 --> 01:25:34,979
You could've told us
that your wife was immoral.

1552
01:25:37,687 --> 01:25:39,729
When I found out,
I couldn't tell it to anyone.

1553
01:25:40,729 --> 01:25:42,146
But when you caught me...

1554
01:25:43,854 --> 01:25:45,229
I couldn't help, but say it.

1555
01:25:46,646 --> 01:25:48,312
No matter how disgusting it is inside...

1556
01:25:48,562 --> 01:25:51,437
a man and wife won't wash
their dirty linen in public.

1557
01:25:52,812 --> 01:25:55,312
-DC sir, I'll leave now.
-What's your opinion?

1558
01:25:55,396 --> 01:25:56,646
My opinion...

1559
01:25:57,062 --> 01:26:00,104
-I'm not sure if you can accept it.
-Tell me anyway.

1560
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:02,854
Motherhood is not defined
only by the female gender.

1561
01:26:03,187 --> 01:26:05,771
It's to do with an unconditional love.

1562
01:26:05,854 --> 01:26:08,021
The punishment you seek
for Masilamani...

1563
01:26:08,312 --> 01:26:12,646
shouldn't affect the child
who's only got 5-6 years left.

1564
01:26:12,937 --> 01:26:16,354
Not only that. Masilamani does not
look like a patient who needs a treatment.

1565
01:26:18,687 --> 01:26:20,729
I'll send you a detailed report.

1566
01:26:40,271 --> 01:26:44,104
-Masilamani, I'll see you later.
-Ma'am, one minute...

1567
01:26:46,396 --> 01:26:50,396
Please... give this kite to Mahesh?

1568
01:26:51,271 --> 01:26:55,021
-Tell him that daddy will meet him soon.
-I'll pray for Mahesh.

1569
01:26:55,854 --> 01:26:58,271
Instead of that, if something were
to happen to me...

1570
01:26:58,771 --> 01:27:01,562
could you take care of Mahesh
like your own son?

1571
01:27:02,271 --> 01:27:03,687
Nothing will happen to you.

1572
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:06,437
He won't bother you for too long.

1573
01:27:11,146 --> 01:27:12,562
-Mahesh?
-Wow!

1574
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:14,271
-Thanks
-Your dad asked me to give this.

1575
01:27:14,437 --> 01:27:16,312
When will Masi come?

1576
01:27:16,396 --> 01:27:17,396
Very soon.

1577
01:27:17,562 --> 01:27:18,979
I wonder when.

1578
01:27:20,562 --> 01:27:23,729
DC sir, those shades look great on you!

1579
01:27:24,187 --> 01:27:27,937
Please ask Thilaka ma'am
to pack lunch for me too.

1580
01:27:28,437 --> 01:27:30,229
My taste buds died along with Usha.

1581
01:27:30,312 --> 01:27:32,646
Why do you need lunch? We're done here.

1582
01:27:32,896 --> 01:27:34,562
Get some food for Masilamani.

1583
01:27:34,812 --> 01:27:35,896
-Dhanaselvam?
-Sir?

1584
01:27:36,146 --> 01:27:37,937
Take care of further formalities.

1585
01:27:38,021 --> 01:27:40,521
Make sure you find
a good home for the child.

1586
01:27:40,604 --> 01:27:42,312
-OK, sir.
-Saami, anything else?

1587
01:27:42,396 --> 01:27:43,937
What about that slipper?

1588
01:27:44,271 --> 01:27:46,437
Oh yeah! I forgot to ask!

1589
01:27:46,854 --> 01:27:51,729
Why leave a size seven slipper that's not
even your size at the three crime scenes?

1590
01:27:52,104 --> 01:27:53,271
Not three, sir.

1591
01:27:53,687 --> 01:27:55,271
At the four crime scenes...

1592
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:58,021
Four? But you didn't kill
your wife, right?

1593
01:27:58,312 --> 01:28:01,729
-It was an accident, right?
-She did die in an accident...

1594
01:28:02,062 --> 01:28:02,896
but...

1595
01:28:03,146 --> 01:28:05,812
That's why I asked if Thilaka ma'am
could send me some food...

1596
01:28:05,896 --> 01:28:09,562
Hey! If you don't tell me how many
you've killed, I'll kill you myself!

1597
01:28:10,687 --> 01:28:11,937
Do you understand now, sir?

1598
01:28:12,104 --> 01:28:14,271
Only circumstance makes
someone a murderer.

1599
01:28:14,812 --> 01:28:16,646
Saami sir, I'm starving.

1600
01:28:16,729 --> 01:28:19,937
-Please get biryani for Mahesh and me.
-Who was the fourth victim?

1601
01:28:24,979 --> 01:28:26,146
Sir...

1602
01:28:26,979 --> 01:28:30,479
Two and half years ago, on April 18th...

1603
01:28:30,562 --> 01:28:32,312
I think it was Good Friday.

1604
01:28:33,562 --> 01:28:36,479
Minister Perumalsamy's brother, Murugesan

1605
01:28:36,562 --> 01:28:40,687
was going for a walk at 5:40 a.m.
from his mistress's house.

1606
01:28:40,896 --> 01:28:43,187
Someone slit his throat
with a kite string

1607
01:28:43,271 --> 01:28:46,104
and smashed his male organ with a rock.

1608
01:28:46,312 --> 01:28:49,604
And he also turned the CCTV camera away.

1609
01:28:51,146 --> 01:28:55,646
Importantly, he has accidentally left
behind a single size 7 slipper.

1610
01:28:55,812 --> 01:28:57,521
It's been over two and half years now.

1611
01:28:58,146 --> 01:29:00,771
and the cops still haven't found
the killer for that murder...

1612
01:29:02,812 --> 01:29:04,021
was also committed by me, sir.

1613
01:29:04,896 --> 01:29:06,229
Why are you all shocked?

1614
01:29:07,562 --> 01:29:10,562
What? You just admitted to killing
a Minister's brother!

1615
01:29:10,646 --> 01:29:12,562
Do you understand its consequences?

1616
01:29:15,521 --> 01:29:17,021
When that murder took place...

1617
01:29:18,062 --> 01:29:19,521
I was working at the Minister's house.

1618
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,021
Yes. It's Masilamani.
Tell me, I'll note down.

1619
01:29:23,771 --> 01:29:25,104
Sir...

1620
01:29:27,896 --> 01:29:33,146
So, from March 10 to April 24, 2017,
you've worked at the Minister's house.

1621
01:29:34,646 --> 01:29:35,604
Why did you do it?

1622
01:29:36,187 --> 01:29:38,062
To facilitate this murder...

1623
01:29:38,396 --> 01:29:39,562
I took up a job there.

1624
01:29:39,729 --> 01:29:41,021
What is the motive for this murder?

1625
01:29:41,437 --> 01:29:42,687
Motive...

1626
01:29:44,062 --> 01:29:47,479
If you press charges against me
and produce me at the court...

1627
01:29:48,812 --> 01:29:51,437
I'll tell the entire truth to the judge.

1628
01:29:52,062 --> 01:29:52,979
But...

1629
01:29:53,104 --> 01:29:57,479
it'd be better if you could check
with the Commissioner if that's okay.

1630
01:29:57,896 --> 01:30:00,521
Why do you want us to check
this specifically with the Commissioner?

1631
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:04,396
Our Commissioner was
the SP in Salem at that time.

1632
01:30:04,479 --> 01:30:07,187
He conducted a special investigation.

1633
01:30:07,354 --> 01:30:09,812
He even got a promotion during that time.

1634
01:30:10,271 --> 01:30:13,604
When you talk about this case,
your eyes seem a little dodgy.

1635
01:30:14,187 --> 01:30:15,479
That is...

1636
01:30:15,687 --> 01:30:20,062
Hunger is blocking my ears
and blurring my vision.

1637
01:30:20,812 --> 01:30:24,437
If you permit me,
I'll have some food and then continue.

1638
01:30:24,521 --> 01:30:28,229
-We've bought his food.
-Give it to him and you all eat too.

1639
01:30:28,312 --> 01:30:30,687
-OK, sir.
-Saami sir, please make Mahesh eat.

1640
01:30:30,937 --> 01:30:33,562
Venkat, I need to speak to the
Commissioner. I'll call you if needed.

1641
01:30:34,437 --> 01:30:35,979
-All of you please wait outside.
-OK, sir.

1642
01:30:39,979 --> 01:30:42,687
He confessed to having committed
all the three murders, sir.

1643
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:44,646
When we were about to conclude the case,

1644
01:30:44,729 --> 01:30:46,604
he suddenly talks about
a two-year-old unsolved case

1645
01:30:46,687 --> 01:30:50,146
and confessed that he killed
Minister Perumalsamy's brother.

1646
01:30:52,146 --> 01:30:53,104
Yes, sir.

1647
01:30:53,354 --> 01:30:55,771
He says he'll tell about the motive
only in the court.

1648
01:30:57,021 --> 01:30:58,021
Sir?

1649
01:30:58,229 --> 01:31:00,646
How are you so sure
he didn't do it, sir?

1650
01:31:01,396 --> 01:31:04,562
Don't mistake me.
But why should we get the Minister's...

1651
01:31:06,146 --> 01:31:07,187
Sorry, sir.

1652
01:31:07,812 --> 01:31:09,604
I better take voluntary retirement!

1653
01:31:11,896 --> 01:31:12,979
DC sir...

1654
01:31:13,771 --> 01:31:17,396
I need the police to even search for
meat pieces in this biryani!

1655
01:31:18,312 --> 01:31:21,104
Saami sir? Is this biryani
or just steamed rice?

1656
01:31:21,354 --> 01:31:24,479
A rickshaw driver's corpse has
been found under Poonamallee flyover.

1657
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:28,812
The corpse is fully decomposed.
That murder too has the same MO.

1658
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,229
-What, Masilamani?
-Sir?

1659
01:31:30,312 --> 01:31:32,646
Are you going to say that
you didn't kill this guy?

1660
01:31:32,729 --> 01:31:34,729
How can I not kill him?

1661
01:31:35,271 --> 01:31:37,062
But that's my last murder.

1662
01:31:37,437 --> 01:31:40,937
I don't have any reason
left to kill anyone else.

1663
01:31:41,812 --> 01:31:43,729
Usha isn't even alive anymore.

1664
01:31:45,521 --> 01:31:47,812
Killing someone is no joke, sir.

1665
01:31:48,354 --> 01:31:50,812
It's even easy to find the killer
in two-three years.

1666
01:31:51,354 --> 01:31:53,187
But that is nothing compared
to the killing.

1667
01:31:53,896 --> 01:31:55,062
Good God!

1668
01:31:56,896 --> 01:31:59,146
Why would you bring it up
while I'm eating?

1669
01:31:59,437 --> 01:32:00,604
I can't eat now!

1670
01:32:00,729 --> 01:32:01,771
I can't.

1671
01:32:04,062 --> 01:32:05,937
-Saami, wait outside.
-OK, sir.

1672
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:10,937
Sorry, sir. What did the
Commissioner say?

1673
01:32:11,146 --> 01:32:12,979
Did he say that I wouldn't have
committed this murder?

1674
01:32:13,062 --> 01:32:15,187
How do you know that?

1675
01:32:15,271 --> 01:32:18,437
Only he knows every
detail about this murder.

1676
01:32:19,437 --> 01:32:22,437
Then why do you confess to
a murder you didn't commit?

1677
01:32:22,646 --> 01:32:25,271
When did I confess?
It was you who said that...

1678
01:32:25,396 --> 01:32:27,812
"Crimes executed in a similar pattern
will be committed by the same person."

1679
01:32:27,896 --> 01:32:32,187
You had a name for that.
Yeah... MO... Method of Operation.

1680
01:32:32,396 --> 01:32:34,687
-Even in the doctor's murder, you said...
-Hello. Tell me, sir.

1681
01:32:34,771 --> 01:32:37,562
the killer has to be the same person
who committed the other two murders.

1682
01:32:37,646 --> 01:32:42,271
Going by the MO, I should've murdered
the Minister's brother too?

1683
01:32:42,521 --> 01:32:43,521
But, sir...

1684
01:32:43,604 --> 01:32:46,062
He's still arguing
he committed that murder.

1685
01:32:46,937 --> 01:32:50,146
If it's okay with you,
can I put him on a video call?

1686
01:32:55,562 --> 01:32:57,604
Masilamani? The Commissioner
is on the line.

1687
01:32:58,146 --> 01:32:59,729
Greetings, sir.

1688
01:32:59,812 --> 01:33:02,187
<i>Why are you confessing to a</i>
<i>murder you didn't commit?</i>

1689
01:33:02,271 --> 01:33:05,062
Before that, I just want
to say something?

1690
01:33:05,146 --> 01:33:09,187
When I was working at
Minister Perumalsamy's house in Salem,

1691
01:33:09,271 --> 01:33:10,896
you were the Salem SP then.

1692
01:33:11,187 --> 01:33:13,396
Exactly two days before the murder,

1693
01:33:13,479 --> 01:33:17,271
as you got off the car,
your left shoe lace got loose.

1694
01:33:17,354 --> 01:33:18,979
-I tied it for you.
<i>-Idiot!</i>

1695
01:33:19,062 --> 01:33:21,646
<i>-Just answer my question!</i>
-Just one more thing...

1696
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:23,896
The night after the murder,
you came to his house again.

1697
01:33:24,021 --> 01:33:27,354
Then you asked for soda
to mix in your drink, sir.

1698
01:33:27,604 --> 01:33:29,646
I ran out and got it for you.

1699
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:34,604
You looked at me and asked in a
deep voice, "Where are you from?".

1700
01:33:34,854 --> 01:33:38,396
I still cannot forget that deep voice...
Oops! The call was disconnected.

1701
01:33:38,979 --> 01:33:39,979
He hung up, sir.

1702
01:33:40,062 --> 01:33:42,271
You don't waste a single word, do you?
Sit down.

1703
01:33:42,354 --> 01:33:45,521
No, sir, he'll call back
and I have to stand again, so...

1704
01:33:45,604 --> 01:33:47,062
There's a hidden meaning there too!

1705
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:52,229
From what you say, it looks like the
Commissioner is involved in this too.

1706
01:33:52,812 --> 01:33:56,062
Damn! Guys like these earn a bad
name to the whole department.

1707
01:33:58,062 --> 01:33:59,437
Shall we continue the video call, sir?

1708
01:34:00,854 --> 01:34:03,396
Yes, sir. It is sensitive, indeed.
I'll step out and talk to you.

1709
01:34:03,479 --> 01:34:08,062
Sir? Can you please ask Saami
to bring my things?

1710
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:12,687
Sir?

1711
01:34:12,771 --> 01:34:13,812
What? Lockup death?

1712
01:34:14,562 --> 01:34:18,646
The right thing to do is to press
charges and produce him in the court.

1713
01:34:18,896 --> 01:34:20,646
Instead, you talk about lockup death?

1714
01:34:20,729 --> 01:34:22,979
No, sir. This is inhumane.

1715
01:34:25,062 --> 01:34:27,521
Sir, I'm already in the mood to resign.

1716
01:34:29,062 --> 01:34:31,146
What, sir? You want to handle it yourself?

1717
01:34:31,479 --> 01:34:32,687
Please come, sir.

1718
01:34:33,396 --> 01:34:36,646
Looks like that Minister
has killed his own brother.

1719
01:34:36,937 --> 01:34:40,937
And the Commissioner has helped him.
He should be beaten to death!

1720
01:34:42,854 --> 01:34:45,896
Saami? Don't let anyone in until
the Commissioner arrives.

1721
01:34:45,979 --> 01:34:47,062
Okay, sir.

1722
01:34:49,854 --> 01:34:51,687
Why are you so upset, sir?

1723
01:34:52,062 --> 01:34:53,937
Did the Commissioner
ask you to release me?

1724
01:34:54,104 --> 01:34:58,146
Should only the rich and powerful escape
using the loopholes in your law?

1725
01:34:58,604 --> 01:35:04,479
Why can't a poor guy like me escape?
I have a sick child to tend.

1726
01:35:04,729 --> 01:35:07,479
-I'm thinking about that too.
-What's there to think about?

1727
01:35:07,729 --> 01:35:10,979
Either, press charges for all the murders
and produce me at the court.

1728
01:35:11,146 --> 01:35:16,812
Then the Minister will also be dragged in.
Let the court decide his fate.

1729
01:35:17,062 --> 01:35:20,187
Or frame someone else for
all these murders

1730
01:35:20,521 --> 01:35:21,854
and release me, sir.

1731
01:35:22,812 --> 01:35:25,729
OK. Say, I release you...

1732
01:35:25,979 --> 01:35:28,687
Do you think the Minister will spare you?

1733
01:35:28,854 --> 01:35:30,896
Sir, I mentioned this yesterday.

1734
01:35:31,146 --> 01:35:33,229
You probably weren't paying attention.

1735
01:35:33,396 --> 01:35:36,021
-What's that?
-I said I sent a petition to Perumal's PA.

1736
01:35:36,104 --> 01:35:38,937
-Yes.
-You thought Perumal was Lord Perumal.

1737
01:35:39,229 --> 01:35:41,729
But in my case, since God's namesake
himself is the criminal,

1738
01:35:41,812 --> 01:35:44,604
I sent my petition directly
to the criminal.

1739
01:35:44,812 --> 01:35:48,687
Perumalsamy, Minister of Social Welfare.
His PA is Mr. Vijayakumar.

1740
01:35:49,396 --> 01:35:53,521
Please call him and ask him
to give my petition to the Minister.

1741
01:35:53,646 --> 01:35:55,437
It's in a blue envelope.

1742
01:35:55,604 --> 01:35:56,979
It says BCC Club.

1743
01:35:57,062 --> 01:35:58,937
-Shall I give you his number, sir?
-Tell me.

1744
01:35:59,021 --> 01:36:02,604
9176734449.

1745
01:36:02,729 --> 01:36:05,979
If you know it by heart,
there must be something!

1746
01:36:06,396 --> 01:36:08,521
Before the Commissioner arrives,
let me see if I can help you.

1747
01:36:09,437 --> 01:36:12,104
-Mr. Vijaykumar, DC Balakrishnan here.
<i>-Hello, sir.</i>

1748
01:36:12,312 --> 01:36:16,729
Among the Minister's latest petitions,
you'll find a blue 'BCC Club' envelope.

1749
01:36:16,979 --> 01:36:19,437
Show it to the Minister at once
and let me know what he says.

1750
01:36:19,521 --> 01:36:20,854
<i>Okay, sir. I'll call you back.</i>

1751
01:36:21,271 --> 01:36:23,479
OK. What have you written
in the petition?

1752
01:36:24,146 --> 01:36:25,229
Not written, sir.

1753
01:36:25,479 --> 01:36:27,187
-I have sent!
-Sent what?

1754
01:36:27,771 --> 01:36:29,062
A flash drive.

1755
01:36:29,396 --> 01:36:31,437
Not the bits and pieces,
tell me everything.

1756
01:36:33,312 --> 01:36:34,396
Well, sir...

1757
01:36:34,646 --> 01:36:36,771
Mahesh is right outside.

1758
01:36:36,854 --> 01:36:39,271
He has a cell phone.
Please ask someone to bring it to me.

1759
01:36:39,354 --> 01:36:40,771
But he won't give it to anyone.

1760
01:36:41,396 --> 01:36:44,729
If you allow me, I'll call him
and he'll send it.

1761
01:36:45,646 --> 01:36:46,729
Thanks, sir.

1762
01:36:49,979 --> 01:36:51,271
Mahesh dear!

1763
01:36:51,479 --> 01:36:54,062
I'm coming... I'm coming very soon!

1764
01:36:54,146 --> 01:36:59,062
Do one thing for me. Please give
your cell phone to Saami.

1765
01:36:59,187 --> 01:37:00,937
Just for a minute. Okay?

1766
01:37:03,479 --> 01:37:05,437
I have a bad habit, sir.

1767
01:37:06,062 --> 01:37:10,646
In my free time, I would record
videos of me singing.

1768
01:37:10,729 --> 01:37:13,229
When I was working
at the Minister's house...

1769
01:37:13,312 --> 01:37:16,187
-they'd make me all the chores.
-<i>Masi?</i>

1770
01:37:16,271 --> 01:37:18,271
"Clean all the rooms", they'd say.

1771
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:21,687
One day, when I was cleaning
and when no one was around,

1772
01:37:21,771 --> 01:37:23,479
I was singing and recording
with my phone,

1773
01:37:23,562 --> 01:37:26,854
I suddenly heard cars honking.
The Minister had come.

1774
01:37:27,271 --> 01:37:31,521
That's it. I rushed out,
forgetting my cell phone. Come in, Saami.

1775
01:37:32,521 --> 01:37:36,604
-The kid's cell phone.
-Later, when I went back and got it...

1776
01:37:38,979 --> 01:37:41,646
The Commissioner will be
here in ten minutes.

1777
01:37:42,187 --> 01:37:45,146
When I checked it, I was shocked!

1778
01:37:45,229 --> 01:37:46,146
I am outside, sir.

1779
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:48,562
The Minister and his guy were
planning something.

1780
01:37:49,854 --> 01:37:53,021
<i>I went to buy a wonderful lamp</i>

1781
01:37:53,187 --> 01:37:54,146
<i>I went to...</i>

1782
01:37:54,229 --> 01:37:57,229
Stumbling upon this was
my greatest luck.

1783
01:37:57,312 --> 01:37:59,812
<i>I went to buy a wonderful lamp</i>

1784
01:38:00,146 --> 01:38:02,562
<i>Greetings, sir. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>-Hey! Get out!</i>

1785
01:38:02,646 --> 01:38:04,687
<i>-Inform me when the SP arrives.</i>
<i>-Okay, sir.</i>

1786
01:38:05,312 --> 01:38:07,104
<i>Balu, see if that jerk's gone.</i>

1787
01:38:08,312 --> 01:38:09,187
<i>He's gone.</i>

1788
01:38:09,271 --> 01:38:11,479
<i>What's bothering you, chief?</i>

1789
01:38:11,562 --> 01:38:15,812
<i>This dog Murugesan is in our party</i>
<i>and working for the opposition.</i>

1790
01:38:15,896 --> 01:38:16,979
<i>He's getting on my nerves!</i>

1791
01:38:17,104 --> 01:38:18,937
<i>-Your brother Murugesan?</i>
<i>-Yes, him.</i>

1792
01:38:19,354 --> 01:38:22,687
<i>He's enjoying my mistress of many years!</i>

1793
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:23,687
<i>Oh!</i>

1794
01:38:23,771 --> 01:38:28,687
-See how disgusting they are!
<i>-When that mongrel is on his walk...</i>

1795
01:38:28,771 --> 01:38:31,979
<i>I want to smash his genitals</i>
<i>and kill him.</i>

1796
01:38:32,104 --> 01:38:35,812
<i>Leave it to me, chief!</i>
<i>You attend your meetings peacefully.</i>

1797
01:38:35,896 --> 01:38:38,479
<i>Do a neat job, Balu. Don't mess up!</i>

1798
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:39,979
Tell me, Vijayakumar.

1799
01:38:40,062 --> 01:38:42,896
<i>DC Sir, the Minister said</i>
<i>he'd speak to the Commissioner.</i>

1800
01:38:42,979 --> 01:38:44,937
<i>You release him at once.</i>

1801
01:38:45,146 --> 01:38:46,937
You don't need to instruct me.

1802
01:38:47,187 --> 01:38:49,437
He has given a petition. Only after
the Minister sees his petition...

1803
01:38:49,562 --> 01:38:52,854
<i>It's only after seeing the petition that</i>
<i>he's asking you forgive and release him.</i>

1804
01:38:52,937 --> 01:38:55,021
<i>These are high level matters.</i>
<i>Please understand!</i>

1805
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:56,812
-Thanks for making me understand.
-Thanks, Vijayakumar sir.

1806
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:59,646
I sent the petition because
the cops were onto me.

1807
01:38:59,729 --> 01:39:01,562
<i>Sir, please send him away!</i>

1808
01:39:02,146 --> 01:39:05,229
I've taken a copy of this
and given it to my friend.

1809
01:39:05,437 --> 01:39:08,396
If my life is in danger
because of the Minister,

1810
01:39:08,479 --> 01:39:12,229
I've sent a polite warning
to the Minister that this will be...

1811
01:39:12,312 --> 01:39:14,312
all over the TV in the next one hour.

1812
01:39:14,396 --> 01:39:17,729
That's why he's forgiven me gracefully.

1813
01:39:19,396 --> 01:39:20,771
OK. Masilamani?

1814
01:39:20,979 --> 01:39:22,812
How will you arrange money
for your son's treatment?

1815
01:39:24,896 --> 01:39:27,146
If Masilamani is alive, that'll do, sir.

1816
01:39:28,187 --> 01:39:31,104
Like how the drowning victims...

1817
01:39:31,937 --> 01:39:33,562
are given mouth-to-mouth resuscitation...

1818
01:39:35,187 --> 01:39:36,812
I'll give him my own breath...

1819
01:39:39,437 --> 01:39:41,229
and save him for as long as I can, sir.

1820
01:39:46,771 --> 01:39:47,771
Sir?

1821
01:39:52,062 --> 01:39:55,812
-Why, sir?
-Keep it. Buy something for your son.

1822
01:39:59,396 --> 01:40:02,604
Gandhi's smile has now a whole
new meaning to me, sir.

1823
01:40:31,312 --> 01:40:32,854
Ma... Masi!

1824
01:40:33,521 --> 01:40:34,687
Masi!

1825
01:40:35,312 --> 01:40:38,979
See! I didn't cry at all!

1826
01:40:39,479 --> 01:40:41,854
I was down with fever yesterday.

1827
01:40:43,229 --> 01:40:46,771
Wow! Have you fixed Mummy's toy?

1828
01:40:48,646 --> 01:40:50,937
You promised to take me to the beach!

1829
01:40:57,187 --> 01:40:58,562
-Masi?
-Yeah?

1830
01:40:58,646 --> 01:41:00,312
When will mummy come back?

1831
01:41:01,562 --> 01:41:05,771
Mummy's not coming. We should get
a passport and visa to meet her.

1832
01:41:05,979 --> 01:41:07,812
Is there a beach there?

1833
01:41:07,979 --> 01:41:09,812
A way bigger beach than this.

1834
01:41:09,896 --> 01:41:13,646
Wow! Then we can happily
fly kites there, right?

1835
01:41:13,979 --> 01:41:15,229
-Why not?
-I don't need help

1836
01:41:15,354 --> 01:41:16,937
with the string anymore.

1837
01:41:17,021 --> 01:41:18,521
I can fly it myself.

1838
01:41:19,271 --> 01:41:23,604
You're better than me now.
See how high it's flying already!

1839
01:41:24,521 --> 01:41:28,896
This is nothing.
I can fly it as high as an airplane.

1840
01:41:31,021 --> 01:41:32,229
Careful!

1841
01:41:43,187 --> 01:41:45,687
<i>Mahesh, it's quite breezy.</i>

1842
01:41:45,771 --> 01:41:49,354
<i>Shall I let the kite go?</i>
<i>Tell me, tell me quick, Mahesh!</i>

1843
01:41:49,479 --> 01:41:52,854
<i>Hold on, Masi! Don't be in a hurry!</i>
<i>Let it go when I tell you.</i>

1844
01:41:52,979 --> 01:41:54,729
<i>-Yeah, right!</i>
<i>-Be ready, be ready!</i>

1845
01:41:54,812 --> 01:41:56,854
<i>-OK.</i>
<i>-Let it go now!</i>

1846
01:41:59,979 --> 01:42:03,187
<i>Chief, you didn't care</i>
<i>about killing your own brother.</i>

1847
01:42:03,312 --> 01:42:07,354
<i>Why don't you kill Masilamani</i>
<i>and add him to the psycho killer's list?</i>

1848
01:42:07,437 --> 01:42:12,562
<i>Hey! If we kill him, his friend's</i>
<i>flash drive will ruin our lives.</i>

1849
01:42:12,937 --> 01:42:15,271
<i>-What's his name again?</i>
<i>-Masilamani.</i>

1850
01:42:15,437 --> 01:42:19,687
<i>If he had other motives, by now</i>
<i>he'd have blackmailed us for money!</i>

1851
01:42:19,771 --> 01:42:22,021
<i>-Yeah.</i>
<i>-That helpless creature must've</i>

1852
01:42:22,104 --> 01:42:24,021
<i>kept it for his safety.</i>

1853
01:42:24,229 --> 01:42:26,979
<i>If he starts wagging his tail,</i>
<i>I know how to chop it off.</i>

1854
01:42:27,104 --> 01:42:28,979
<i>-What do you say?</i>
<i>-What's there to say?</i>

1855
01:42:29,062 --> 01:42:32,104
<i>You simply give orders.</i>
<i>I'll take the risk and do it.</i>

1856
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:34,187
<i>Dingus! What a risk taker!</i>

1857
01:42:34,271 --> 01:42:37,104
<i>When I ask you to finish off someone,</i>
<i>you leave a slipper behind!</i>

1858
01:42:37,187 --> 01:42:38,229
<i>A small slip.</i>

1859
01:42:38,937 --> 01:42:42,479
<i>What a game he's played</i>
<i>with that single slipper!</i>

1860
01:42:42,771 --> 01:42:46,646
<i>I'll kill you and add you</i>
<i>to that Masilamani's list!</i>
