1
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,440
'Let secrets be revealed'

2
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,960
Fantastic girl
Shall I make a try?

3
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,280
No...no emotion, John

4
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,280
Hey, I'll serve
Give it to me

5
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,120
You won't get her
Try some other girl

6
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,640
Country fellow
To whom are you talking?

7
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,040
Once this peg is over I'll
get into straight action

8
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,320
Are you new here?
What is the problem?

9
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,480
- My lover left me
- Break up

10
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,480
Enjoy this
Come on

11
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:39,400
"Magarita! Magarita!
You will get it in pack"

12
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,480
"Magarita! Magarita!
You will get it in pack"

13
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,240
"This is break up day;
you celebrate"

14
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,200
"Day by day, you will
be in intoxication"

15
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,000
"Hereafter, there is no worry"

16
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,760
"There won't be any
work for our cell phones"

17
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:11,440
"This is my magical heart
open it up now"

18
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,840
"This is my magical heart
open it up now"

19
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,560
"Slowly when the
intoxication intrudes in"

20
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,280
"Even a weak fellow
will become Hitler"

21
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,640
"There won't be loss in expense"

22
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,360
"I will come behind you"

23
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:50,080
"There are too many mistakes"

24
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,160
"It will be focused in your eyes"

25
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,800
"Your shyness will look at you"

26
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,400
"And it will run away
by saying bye to you"

27
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:11,720
"It's a sculptural place;
it will remain so cool"

28
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:18,160
"With my slight look,
the scenario will change"

29
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,280
"Say hello by provoking my hormone"

30
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,080
"You will call
my pimples as popcorn"

31
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:01,680
"If both male and female are nature,
their love must be culture"

32
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,720
"The foreign country
might be a great place"

33
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,400
"Or will you remain in cage?"

34
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,960
"If there is a break up,
then you need not worry at all"

35
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:27,200
"This is my magical heart
open it up now"

36
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:33,720
"This is my magical heart
open it up now"

37
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,280
John, get up

38
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,520
That girl is lying in the bathroom

39
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,800
Which girl?

40
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,040
The girl whom we
both tried to get close with

41
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,560
- She must be lying drunk
- She is not lying drunk

42
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,120
She is lying dead

43
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,440
- What are you saying?
- Yes, come soon

44
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,360
Where is he looking at?

45
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,800
To see whether she is
alive you saw at a place

46
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,800
There is no chance of
anyone inspecting that way

47
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,360
Charmi...

48
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,240
Isn't she beautiful?

49
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,160
See her without makeup
She'll look awful

50
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,200
Hey, I'll inform the police

51
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,120
Why did you cut the phone?

52
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,120
Do you want this pub
to run or not?

53
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,160
What is the connection between
this pub running and police?

54
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,520
On phoning not only police
but media will also come

55
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,680
Already media is criticizing
whatever is happening in pub

56
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,480
If something happens to her,
we'll also be criticized

57
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,680
After starting a party...

58
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,720
...if a person is thinking
about what ideology to keep for that

59
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,200
...after having a peg he'll
decide this as the ideology

60
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,560
Then he'll land here with
hundred people talking about culture

61
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:48,120
For the money that they have got,
they'll break this pub to pieces...

62
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,600
...and take away
the rest of the things

63
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,800
- Do we deserve this?
- Don't confuse me

64
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,280
Then should we leave her like that?

65
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,440
If left like that,
she'll suffocate and die

66
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,240
- We'll take her to inner hall
- Okay, hold her leg

67
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,760
Why should I?
You hold her leg

68
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,080
Those who have held on to
leg have achieved in life

69
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,600
Don't you want to achieve?

70
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,440
Okay, I myself will achieve

71
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,000
To tell the truth God has
created her really beautifully

72
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,160
- What are you doing?
- I was seeing if it was there?

73
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,760
- What?
- That thing

74
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,960
It is sure to be there
at the right place

75
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,040
You don't try to act naughty, come

76
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,840
It is only hair
Nothing else

77
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,840
Charu...look at me

78
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,240
Charu dear...Charu baby

79
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,160
What are you doing?

80
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,320
Your father is here
Your mother is here

81
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,560
Your boy friend has
come with booze

82
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,080
Get lost, drunkard

83
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:11,960
Give it to me

84
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,520
Hey! You might kill her

85
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,480
We brought her here thinking
she might die of suffocation

86
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,240
I think she'll die from
the way you are spraying this

87
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,600
She is totally flat
with intoxication

88
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,440
Shall I give her butter milk
to regain conscious?

89
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,880
Is she in a state of drinking that?

90
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,760
Then shall I put my finger
inside her mouth and make her vomit?

91
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,000
Will you do this for
an 80 year old lady?

92
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Old lady?
Chee...is that a mouth?

93
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,520
You either booze or
see sex film in mobile

94
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,240
Don't you have any seriousness?

95
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,200
Is it Tamil or English?
Give it to me

96
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,240
Hey! This is her phone

97
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,040
See if her boyfriend's
number is there

98
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,080
We'll inform him

99
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,280
The name given to her
boyfriend is ATM, Ambulance...

100
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,640
Sharp, Geth, zip
XX, XXX Newly 10 X

101
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,840
Father, mother, brother, sister
There is nothing

102
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,040
As soon as Saturday comes,
they'll reach heaven freely

103
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,560
You ask them
why they are boozing

104
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,760
They'll say they are drinking
due to monthly target, mind stress

105
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,280
They wish to drink
For that they need thousand reasons

106
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,800
Why do you drink?

107
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:31,320
Seeing this kind of atrocity
how can I remain without drinking?

108
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,640
Correct dude

109
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,360
- Same feel
- Drink it

110
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,200
Buddy, the call is for you

111
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,520
You leave
I'll look after her

112
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,280
Will you make her vomit by putting
your finger inside her mouth?

113
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,840
I'll kill you
Drunkard

114
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,400
Have you not left till now?

115
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,240
Being Saturday there was
heavy crowd

116
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,160
Are you boozing?

117
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
No, while coming shall I
get ice cream for you?

118
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,800
No need for any ice
Come soon

119
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:05,960
Okay, I'll come

120
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,080
Hey, stop

121
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
She is biting me
Come and do something

122
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,360
Oh God! Knife

123
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,880
Come on
Do something

124
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,920
Don't bite, Charmi
Don't bite

125
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,320
I'll give you a peg
or a leg piece

126
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,280
Did you see how I got you released?

127
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,240
- Catch her
- It's bleeding

128
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,880
- You go and catch her
- Get lost, idiot

129
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,400
- Close her mouth
- Don't shout

130
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,240
Let me go

131
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,680
- What is she saying?
- Don't kill me

132
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,600
Hey, who is going to kill you?

133
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,840
Please ask him to go out

134
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,120
Hey, why is he going to kill you?

135
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,280
- Because he raped me
- What?

136
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,000
- What are you saying?
- Yes, he raped me

137
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,040
Fearing that I might reveal it
he tried to kill me

138
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,320
Who, me? She is
blabbering in intoxication

139
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,720
Damn it!
Who is blabbering?

140
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,920
In bathroom you-

141
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:44,960
He hit me
Here is that wound

142
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,720
I lost my consciousness

143
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,280
Then-

144
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,680
You were lying
unconscious in bathroom

145
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,200
I and John only brought you

146
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,200
Tell her
You were there with me

147
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,840
The photos taken by us
is there in that

148
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,480
- Please get that
- Give it to her

149
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,200
I'll show you the pictures, give it

150
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,800
He has deleted everything

151
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,760
Charu, you are drunk
You don't know what happened

152
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,000
Think properly
Is it him?

153
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,920
A kind of smell came from his body

154
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,360
Ask him to come close to me
I need to smell him

155
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,320
Do you want to smell?
You can be a smelling dog

156
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,560
But I'm not a criminal

157
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,560
You are not a criminal, isn't it?
Then why are you scared?

158
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,800
- You too?
- Go, man

159
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,320
- Ask him to look at me
- Look at her

160
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,600
What is wrong with you?
You come and stand

161
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,280
That smell is not coming from him

162
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,160
I think he has had a bath

163
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,200
But I'm confirmed that it is him

164
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,360
With whom did you
come to the pub?

165
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,520
I came alone

166
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,880
This is the first time
I'm coming to this pub

167
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,920
You people think that if a girl dresses up
modernly and drinks and smokes...

168
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,440
...she'll sleep with any fellow, isn't it?

169
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,240
I'll booze and smoke
But I won't sleep with any guy

170
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,440
The only gift that I'll be
giving my man is only that

171
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,920
Each girl will have a big dream about
her first night after she attains age

172
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,120
I also had one like that

173
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,440
For his sexual urge
he insulted that in the toilet

174
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,640
I won't leave you alone
Are you a man?

175
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,040
Dude! Say to her
I am not that

176
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,760
What is this? She herself
talked bravely and fainted

177
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,840
She says I hit her
I bit her and raped her

178
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,120
I tried to murder her
I didn't do anything at all

179
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,320
Lift her

180
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,600
Oh No! Good bye to you and
goodbye to this devil Charmi

181
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,920
You can lift her

182
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,280
After that she will say you are
the father of her child

183
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,280
Leave me alone
She has made me booze

184
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
Why did you do like that?

185
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,520
She is blabbering in intoxication
Why are you also talking like this?

186
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,520
Nowadays rape is a serious matter

187
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,600
If she goes to police,
you'll be straight away hanged

188
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,640
She looks wealthy and healthy

189
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,080
Try to marry her and get settled

190
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,000
Why are you so much
interested in getting me trapped?

191
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,680
Let me go

192
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,240
Trying to escape?

193
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,680
Leave

194
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,840
Wherever you go,
you have to come only here

195
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,600
You also come
We'll leave

196
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,880
It was you who made a mistake

197
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,040
Why should I come with you?

198
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,400
Why are you trying to corner me?

199
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,520
Did I only make a pass at her?
You also tried

200
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,840
I didn't get her
But you got her, isn't it?

201
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,880
John, help me
Please

202
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,120
There is only one way out
There are two categories of girls

203
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,840
One category will shout and scream that
they lost their virtue and commit suicide

204
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,280
Another won't bother whatever
happens and will enjoy life

205
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,960
She is of the second category
I'll solve this problem

206
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,480
Is there cctv camera in pub?

207
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,480
Can I see that?

208
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,840
- We don't record it?
- Why?

209
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,520
Any kind of people come
They drink heavily

210
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,560
Anything can happen
So we don't switch it on

211
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,360
We don't even allow
camera mobile

212
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,800
- How did you carry it inside?
- I don't know

213
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,520
Why don't you
look at the face and talk?

214
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,480
I'm a sentimental idiot

215
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,680
If I find anyone feeling bad

216
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,680
I'll also get feeling
and start crying

217
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,240
Charmi, while drunk
something's happen

218
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:22,200
In our life it is normal
Take it easy, Charmi

219
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,880
Shall I drop you?

220
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,800
I'm confused about who raped me

221
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:34,120
If this same situation comes to your
wife or sister, will you take it easy?

222
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,200
- Give me drink
- Don't drink, Charmi

223
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,360
Already you are drunk

224
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,920
If you drink more,
you'll become flat

225
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,640
You need lemon juice

226
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,160
Hey, I asked only that, give me

227
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,400
Charu, I'm not the kind of
person that you are thinking

228
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:18,000
Charu...I didn't do that rape

229
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,640
- I didn't do that 'R'
- Which 'R'?

230
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,040
Fearing the word rape
and saying as 'R'

231
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,880
That big...

232
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,040
I'm useless

233
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,600
In these matters one who
is smart will get duped

234
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,520
But only an idiot like
you will achieve

235
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,200
Why are you cornering only me?

236
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,800
So many came to the pub
Someone else could have done

237
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:48,360
Are you trying to divert me?

238
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,200
What is the closing time of the pub?

239
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,040
12 a.m

240
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,360
The closing time
of pub was 12 a.m

241
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,960
Those who are drinking get
half an hour grace time

242
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,400
My watch has stopped
at 1:15 a.m time

243
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,400
That too has also
happened only at 1:15 time

244
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,400
It is not possible for anyone
else to be there at that time

245
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,280
So I'm confirmed that
only you have done it

246
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,720
What proof do you have?

247
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,640
Do you want proof?
Let's start from the beginning

248
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,160
This is my level

249
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,120
If I drink more,
I won't know what is happening

250
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,520
Didn't you give me free drink?

251
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,680
- Answer me
- I didn't give you any drink

252
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,200
Don't lie

253
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,520
You gave me three pegs
and I'm sure

254
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,720
Hey, I didn't give 3 pegs
I gave only one peg

255
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,760
What for did you give?

256
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,960
It was for that

257
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:44,400
But I didn't do that 'R'
I did give you a peg

258
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,160
But after that I don't
know where you went

259
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,080
I searched all over the pub
But you were not there

260
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,760
Hey! You'll say you won't smoke
But you'll smoke

261
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,000
You'll say you won't booze
But you'll booze

262
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,160
When you said you didn't do,
I'm sure you only did it

263
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,280
Say sorry to her
Forgive him, Charmi

264
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,160
He did by mistake

265
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,680
Did he stamp on my feet
to forgive him?

266
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,600
He spoilt my life
He must not be left alone

267
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,320
Hey! Not only me,
he also tried

268
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,080
To get your attention
he chased you like a dog

269
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Think properly

270
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
In the three pegs that you had
only one was given by me

271
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,960
Rest two must have
been given by him

272
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,040
Did she give so much
built up for only fingers?

273
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,800
He is blabbering in fear

274
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,400
I saw you first time
only in bathroom

275
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,680
Were you not the one
who received me?

276
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,800
After that you asked something else

277
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,000
Why did you keep looking at me?

278
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,320
I'm in no mood

279
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,320
Didn't you call me to dance?

280
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,600
In intoxication I forgot
I did call you

281
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,560
But you went away
saying you are in no mood

282
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,200
After that I didn't see you at all

283
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,520
First you said
you didn't see me at all

284
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,000
Now you are saying you forgot

285
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,720
What is this? You are acting

286
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,560
Why can't you have done this?

287
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,320
First he, now is it me?
I'm not that cheap

288
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,320
Neither you nor he are cheap

289
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,720
It is only me who is cheap as
I don't know with whom I slept

290
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:44,640
One of you have only done that

291
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,280
Neither of you are confessing

292
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
Without knowing that
I won't go from here

293
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,680
Hug me

294
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,800
What happened?
Only this much?

295
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,000
There is a super idea to
prove that I didn't do that 'R'

296
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,160
You smelt me and hugged me
Why not do that 'R' and see?

297
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,080
That time you'll know for
sure that I didn't do it

298
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,480
You are neither ready to
accept that I didn't do...

299
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,120
...nor are you ready
to do it and see

300
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,480
What should I do?

301
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
- Hug me
- I'm saying that I didn't do

302
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,120
Hey! You don't say no
After hugging Charu will say

303
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,560
You please continue, Charu

304
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,360
Husain, you lost the chance

305
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,920
Why did you push me away?

306
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,160
If you hug me so tightly, am I
an impotent not to get mood?

307
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,080
I also got the mood
But I controlled myself

308
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,680
Hey, it is the police

309
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,000
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the police

310
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,840
Hey, no police

311
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:00,120
If the police come, media will enter
and then politicians will enter

312
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,280
You told me rhyming
with timing, now you tell that

313
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,120
If you go to police,
I'll get into trouble

314
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,680
Already there is a case on me
If you go now, they'll corner only me

315
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,960
Scoundrel! Did you talk about media,
politician and beating only for this?

316
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
You said they'll come in
lorry and take everything

317
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,240
What is the case on you?

318
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,040
Whether you want to know
the case on me or who raped you?

319
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,320
Go, man

320
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,760
Please don't say anything

321
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,880
- No one is to be seen
- Husain brother

322
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,000
Sir, why are you
coming from below?

323
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,800
- Inspector wants stuff
- Not now, sir

324
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,440
As soon Saturday comes
heaven can be seen

325
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,200
You are enjoying life
Who is she? She is superb

326
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,280
Both of you must
have had a fight

327
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:14,920
No, sir

328
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,760
You fight for even lousy figures

329
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,640
She is superb
Will you both leave?

330
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,360
You would have had a war

331
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,760
Last week you both had a fight
about who'll do the opening

332
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
That time I only
controlled the law and order

333
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,200
By doing the toss I only
inaugurated the match

334
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,720
Today also only I'll
control the law and order

335
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,560
- Let's do Saaboothri
- Chee

336
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:38,000
We kept her in confusion

337
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,520
Now you made her
clearly understand

338
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,920
Scoundrel!
Now we are finished

339
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,920
- Come, sir
- Is there is no match today?

340
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,280
Be quiet sir

341
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,680
Is it eye or gun?
My God!

342
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:58,040
After becoming old on seeing girls
like her I get angry over myself

343
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,560
Will the tablets that John
consume work out for me?

344
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,120
You'll get heart attack, sir

345
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,760
Desiring for sex
don't die suddenly, sir

346
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,520
Arumugam!
Arumugam!

347
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,880
- Arumugam online, sir
- Where are you?

348
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,120
- In the spot, sir
- Did you catch John?

349
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,880
- Sir, I have caught John
- Very good

350
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,760
That

351
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,440
- Sir, I have caught
- Super...super...super

352
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,600
John accepted his
crime and gave statement

353
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,280
He is ready to give report

354
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,360
- Is that enough?
- No need

355
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,680
All that is not needed

356
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,680
Who is else?

357
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,440
Sir, John's cousin brother is there

358
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,760
Has he been trapped?
Arrest him immediately

359
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,760
- I have arrested him, sir
- Good job

360
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,800
Arumgam, to deal with the accused
buy chicken biryani and mutton fry

361
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,040
It is a big case

362
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,720
The matter should
remain as a secret

363
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:54,320
Sir, I have 30 years service
It'll remain as secret

364
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,080
Okay

365
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:58,720
Sir, you talk openly in wireless
Won't AC say anything, sir?

366
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,080
He'll talk in another code word

367
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:04,080
Sir, there are brilliant officers
in your department...

368
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,880
...who control law and order

369
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,480
But you control law and
order in a special manner

370
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,640
Only because of men like us
people like you are surviving

371
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,640
Just because we take bribe,
will you talk anything?

372
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,080
Send the girl away soon
Inspector is a young man

373
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,040
On seeing her he'll lose control

374
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,520
Here the problem itself
is about who lost control

375
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,800
Doesn't she know who lost control?

376
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:27,280
- How?
- Alcoholism

377
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,080
- Alcoholism?
- 'Arumugam...?'

378
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,120
- Arumugam!
- He is going on calling

379
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,320
- Arumugam, where are you?
- I'm in the spot, sir

380
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,040
Did any of the accused escape?

381
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,000
Not a single accused
can escape from me, sir

382
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,480
All accused under my control

383
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,600
If you don't leave
even lousy figures...

384
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
...in my case you would have
had a jolly time

385
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,760
Both of you together
have done this mistake

386
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,560
First he and then me
Now is it both of us?

387
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,840
If you dress up like that,
why won't that happen?

388
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,880
From 8 year old child to 80
year old lady it is happening

389
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,320
Are they dressing up modernly?

390
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,280
You are playing with us

391
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,200
Did really something like
that happen to you?

392
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,960
That thing which I thought
as my life's big dream...

393
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,400
...happened first time,
I couldn't tolerate it at all

394
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:31,320
I felt disgusting
Vomiting sense

395
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,240
After this if I must
know who that is...

396
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,840
You won't tell the truth
But I'm not ready to leave you

397
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,160
You said that I'm playing
Can you prove that?

398
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,480
Come, let us go to the hospital

399
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,280
Superb!
We'll go to the hospital

400
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,720
- We'll go
- We'll go

401
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,240
By chance in alcoholism
if I had done that 'R'...

402
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,520
...on testing I'll get trapped

403
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,840
After that as you said
I'll get hanged

404
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,360
No need to go to hospital
We'll make the doctor come here

405
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,600
- Will any doctor come?
- I'll make the doctor come

406
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,280
In ten minutes time
your lie will get proved

407
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,080
After that I'll deal with you

408
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,440
- It is the doctor
- Go

409
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,760
You wait a bit
I'll come

410
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,920
If this matter comes out,
our life will become a tragedy

411
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,840
She is trying to play
with us for some reason

412
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,920
We want to know whether
really that 'R' took place

413
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,120
Please, doctor
Help us somehow

414
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,320
We trust you

415
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,160
- Husain, I'm a psychiatrist
- Mental doctor?

416
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,200
Why did you bring a psychiatrist?

417
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,080
I know that only now
Doctor...doctor...doctor

418
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,680
Only after knowing all this you
would have become a doctor

419
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,840
My career will get
spoilt with police and court

420
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,280
That will be only if this comes out

421
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,960
Only with her consent
we brought you here

422
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,000
Even if we get caught,
we won't involve you

423
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,480
Please, doctor
Trust us

424
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,240
Check her up, doctor
Check her up

425
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,720
You can use John's room

426
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,720
No, that won't be right
It'll be dusty, doctor

427
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,160
You can examine her here
We'll wait in the room

428
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,160
- Okay
- Go, man

429
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,000
Doctor! Examine her
patiently and slowly

430
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,120
'Take it
This is my blood'

431
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:31,640
'This is more redder than
the whisky that you drink daily'

432
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,560
'This has got more
intoxication than that'

433
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:37,320
'You'll never become sober
Hold this'

434
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:40,360
'Drink well, till your
thirst gets quenched'

435
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,200
'- Hold it
- Latha...'

436
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,560
'Look at the face'

437
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:47,000
'Will anyone flourish
after seeing this face?'

438
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,320
'Morning only you said that I look
like Mahalakshmi with this mouth'

439
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:52,760
'That is a different mouth
This is a stinking mouth'

440
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,720
Hey! Switch that off

441
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,840
To reduce the tension
I thought of seeing TV

442
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,480
At night they are instigating us

443
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,600
What she said is true

444
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,640
She needs to be given
treatment immediately

445
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,320
I don't want treatment
I just want to know

446
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,440
I need to know who it is, doctor

447
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:27,360
How much ever I try
they both are confusing me

448
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,280
But they can't do that to you
Because you are a psychiatrist

449
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,560
You can find out easily who is
lying and who is telling the truth

450
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,440
I need to know who it is, doctor

451
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,440
Who is that?
Doctor...

452
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,600
You have mesmerized me

453
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,680
You are going to find out
the secrets in my deep heart

454
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,680
Doctor, the matters that
happened in my life are silly matters

455
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,200
You tell me about John

456
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,560
John...for friendship John
is the right person, doctor

457
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,600
He is the biggest gift
that I got in my life

458
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,280
Does John booze?

459
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:32,560
Like juice he'll enjoy
and drink, doctor

460
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:35,400
Has he become ever
emotional when he is not drunk?

461
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:41,480
As girl's party was coming to see me
mother told me to come to home town

462
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,080
What did you do
today at 1 o'clock?

463
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,440
I was talking with John

464
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,480
Okay, mother told
you to come

465
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,160
John and I went in bus
He asked me for booze

466
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,880
I told him that
I had no money

467
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,280
He said okay

468
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,280
After sometime he asked me
whether I had any money

469
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,800
I said no

470
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,720
Without money
why did you bring me?

471
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,720
All those who were
in the bus stared at me

472
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,760
I felt insulted

473
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,480
How is he in girl's matter?

474
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,960
He will get girl's very easily, doctor

475
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:24,200
He'll tell me also to enjoy
He is a very good person, doctor

476
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,880
Is it because he sets up girls for you?

477
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:29,480
In these days when people think
to even buy single tea and give...

478
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:34,600
...he sets up girls for me
He has got such a big heart, doctor

479
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,200
Do you know a matter, doctor?
There was a boy in the pub

480
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,400
He had TB

481
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,000
No one used to come close to
him fearing that they'll also catch TB

482
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,840
Without bothering about that he
kept that boy with him for 6 months

483
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,360
He got him treated
and then sent him home

484
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,200
Till this date he has
not said a word about that

485
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,760
My buddy is
genuine, doctor

486
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,040
How much is my score, doctor?

487
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:05,880
A judge who can't tell the score

488
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,600
What are you doing, John?

489
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,640
If we keep doing like this,
it'll be tasty

490
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,920
Tell me about your friend Husain

491
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,840
He is not my friend
He is just my coworker

492
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:45,120
Are you disturbed, John?

493
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,280
It is sweating
AC is not working

494
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:52,360
Does Husain booze?

495
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,960
He'll have free drinks
He'll drink secretly

496
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,560
Always he'll talking
to someone in phone

497
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,520
Once I got a missed call

498
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,280
Today what did you
do at 1 o'clock, John?

499
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,720
I slept off

500
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,760
You got a missed call
Then?

501
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,400
Aunty or girl?

502
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:14,240
- Are you an aunty or girl?
- I'm an aunty

503
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,720
Then that was also
aunty only

504
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:17,920
I talked to her
She also talked

505
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,280
She kept talking

506
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,680
- One day she called
- For what?

507
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,800
She called me to discuss about
the onion price which had shot up

508
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:35,000
If I tell this matter to him, he'll go
and discuss the onion price with her

509
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,600
Without knowing that I went

510
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,720
She drove me away saying how many
of you will discuss onion price

511
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,160
Did you get too much
disturbed, John?

512
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:47,880
No...!

513
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,280
- Leave the ice cube
- I'll throw it

514
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:26,880
John, are you going out somewhere?

515
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,320
You look very fresh

516
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,280
I loved and married my wife
She gifted me a car

517
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,960
John, we are not
talking about your wife

518
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,480
We are talking about Husain

519
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,280
Husain is a good friend
He is a light drinker

520
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:47,960
In girls matter he is...

521
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,240
Once he gets married,
he'll be alright

522
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,840
You are right, Charmi
Any of the two could have done this

523
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:02,840
Scoundrel!

524
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,080
But the chances of John
doing it is more than Husain

525
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,840
Because John is a drinker

526
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,840
When you put injection I knew

527
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,520
There was no medicine
It was just distilled water

528
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,960
Was it Bislery water?

529
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,840
You have understood me
wrongly, doctor

530
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,440
I drink for enjoyment
I'm not a drinker

531
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:26,040
No, John
I have been observing you

532
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,920
You kept wetting your lips

533
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,120
The reason for that is the alcohol
that is there in the body

534
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,000
You never saw eye to eye
with me and talked

535
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,040
There was a trembling inside you

536
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,600
You stutter and talk

537
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,240
All this comes to those
who are addicted to alcohol

538
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,640
According to medical science
you are in the third stage of drinking

539
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,040
Those who drink casually
come under first stage

540
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,320
Second stage is rationalization

541
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,120
We call people in that
stage as light drinkers

542
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,000
If night comes, they have to drink

543
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,280
For that they'll set it in mind at
2 o'clock in the day time itself

544
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,880
People like you who are in the 3rd
stage will always keep drinking

545
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,440
They can remain normal
only if they drink

546
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:09,440
Else their hands and
legs will start to tremble

547
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,280
Unnecessarily they'll get angry

548
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:13,080
They won't be able to eat
They'll get fits

549
00:55:13,120 --> 00:55:15,800
They'll get feeling that
somebody is talking in their ears

550
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:18,320
It is called as
auditory hallucination

551
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,480
I asked you about one thing

552
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,200
But you answered about
another thing

553
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:23,600
It is called as cause of psychologist

554
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,440
You keep holding your
right shoulder

555
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:28,840
It is called as honeymoon policy

556
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,320
On drinking they'll keep
talking to someone in phone

557
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,680
That is called as telephone scatology

558
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,680
Doctor, I'm a light drinker
A quarter and a cutting

559
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:40,240
Even a small quantity
of poison is poisonous

560
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:42,200
If I drink lesser than that,
I won't become high

561
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,880
In this there is an extreme thing

562
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,600
High risk sexual behavior person

563
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,440
This problem comes in the 3rd stage

564
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,360
How much ever you drink
you won't get alcoholism

565
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,880
Another thing will get
into your mind

566
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,840
Lust

567
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,800
For that you'll go
to the extreme

568
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,880
So for the chances of
you doing this is more

569
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:07,720
God selected a person
In a room he kept a child...

570
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:11,560
...a 20 year old girl and
a full bottle of alcohol

571
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:15,560
He told him that in these
three you can do one mistake

572
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,320
Either you kill that child

573
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,960
Else you rape the girl or
you drink the alcohol

574
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:26,640
He said killing a child is a sin
To rape a girl is a bigger sin than that

575
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,320
So he consumed the alcohol

576
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:33,560
Once he got intoxicated sex got
on to his head, so he raped the girl

577
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,960
As the child is a disturbance he
strangled and killed the child

578
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,920
If he had remained without drinking,
he would have done only one mistake

579
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,280
Due to drinking he made
all the three mistakes

580
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,760
So God himself has proved that
drinking is an atrocious mistake

581
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,720
Is God a psycho?
He knew it'll happen like this

582
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,920
Is he enjoying?

583
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:52,960
On drinking a person will try
to grab the hand of some lady

584
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,160
He'll bed without knowing the
difference between wife and daughter

585
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,320
- Isn't it?
- Of course

586
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,440
This is what is
happening in today's society

587
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,960
Because you are in alcoholism
you don't know about the world

588
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,320
The tele medical student rape
that shocked the whole of India

589
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,560
6 evil drinkers did that
Do you know that?

590
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:14,600
If somebody has to be murdered
only on drinking they get courage

591
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:18,200
One who fears to stab
one time stabs 10 times

592
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,320
In all over India it is only in Tamil Nadu
that maximum accidents take place

593
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,600
So for the 75% mistakes that are
taking place in society...

594
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,080
...it is only drinks
which are responsible

595
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,720
All drunkards are rapists and criminals

596
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,400
They are unfit to live
in society, isn't it so?

597
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,280
All those who drink are not wrong

598
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,000
If we take into
account all the crimes...

599
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:39,160
...it is only drunkards who are
responsible for the 75% of the crimes

600
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,240
It is only intoxication
that has made him do it

601
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:43,000
It could have made you
also do this mistake

602
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,320
You are constantly
talking about intoxication

603
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,640
Who is not in intoxication?
You are also in intoxication

604
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:48,400
In medical there are
so many departments

605
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,960
Why did you choose psychiatry?

606
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,760
It is the intoxication to know what is there
in another person's heart, isn't it?

607
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:57,320
On seeing a grown up child on road
don't people make love to it?

608
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,840
That is also a kind of intoxication

609
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,880
All medical drugs have intoxication

610
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,800
There is nothing here
without intoxication

611
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:05,320
This whole world is imbalanced

612
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,480
God!

613
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,560
Is it wrong if I drink?

614
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,760
6 months before there
was a small accident

615
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,680
Doctor only told me
to have light drink

616
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:17,080
Which doctor told you, John?

617
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,600
Include lot of water
Have 4 rounds of quarter

618
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,920
Mix pomegranate juice
You won't have any problem

619
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,440
Which doctor told you like this?

620
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:26,720
I'm 100% sure that you
are a drunkard

621
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,920
- No, I'm not a drunkard
- I'll prove that you are a drunkard

622
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,440
One hour...you remain
without drinking for one hour

623
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,600
If it doesn't happen as I said, I'll
trust you that you are not a drunkard

624
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:38,080
Why one hour? I'll remain
without drinking for one whole day

625
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,320
No need for one whole day
One hour is enough

626
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,640
Your time starts now

627
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,400
John...

628
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,800
- What?
- What?

629
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:47,400
Did you call me?

630
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:21,640
Sit on one side

631
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:54,560
Shall I do face wash and come?

632
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,120
No

633
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,040
Shall I go to rest room and come?

634
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,920
No...!

635
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,680
- If you want, you can come
- No, John

636
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,480
Why dude?

637
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,320
Actually, why should I prove
to you that I am a drunkard?

638
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,120
Who are you?
I will drink

639
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,680
Over

640
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:39,920
John, you didn't do this

641
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,880
The alcohol in you
made you to do like this

642
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,760
You cannot remain
without drinking

643
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,520
Because, you are a drinker

644
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,080
Hey, get lost
Else, I will kill you

645
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:53,640
You won't kill me

646
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:56,000
The alcohol in you will
provoke you to murder

647
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:00,080
Hey, tell her to get lost
Hey, tell her to go

648
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,760
Please, doctor
Take leave

649
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:18,320
I am unable to help you
Please take legal action

650
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:24,800
Look, John

651
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:27,520
Don't think that no one
knows what you are doing

652
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,400
Will you take leave
only if I beat you?

653
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,680
Please, Doctor
Please take leave

654
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,240
He might do something

655
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:45,960
Hey, don't you have sense?
That doctor came to help us

656
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,520
But you are telling that you
will beat her and kill her

657
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,240
I thought of solving this
issue with the help of doctor

658
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,760
But you sent her out, you fool

659
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,640
Hey, who is that mental?

660
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:57,000
You did everything
Now are you acting?

661
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,640
After finishing in bathroom, you
are waking up the sleeping guy

662
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:02,200
You call the police also

663
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,200
Thinking that we will get
caught if we go to hospital...

664
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,840
...you are calling the
doctor whom you know

665
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:06,720
Super

666
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:09,800
In the midst of all these, she
says that John is a drinker

667
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,960
You are converting my minus
points as your plus points

668
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:14,400
Finally, are you planning
to put me in trouble?

669
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,200
Hey, I am your friend

670
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,000
Cha, you are a shameless fellow

671
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,680
Yes, unable to tolerate
your torture...

672
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,320
...your wife stayed in my
house throughout the night

673
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,960
In that sense, I am a
shameless fellow only

674
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,920
Are you talking wrongly
about my wife?

675
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,040
Sorry dude

676
01:04:56,200 --> 01:04:57,920
- Hey!
- Leave

677
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,720
Superb drama
Both of you will fight

678
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:05,640
Due to me, there arose a
rift between two close friends

679
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,880
Thinking like that, I
myself will leave the place

680
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:09,880
- Is that your plan?
- No

681
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:11,360
Nothing like that will happen

682
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,880
Without knowing who did that,
none of you can leave this place

683
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,040
It's not him and me
Whatever you want, you can do

684
01:05:19,560 --> 01:05:21,880
- I will call police
- Go

685
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,240
By giving money, there
will be thousands to save

686
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:27,440
What are you thinking?

687
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,560
If I go to police, you will
get released within two months

688
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,200
You will roam around by boozing well

689
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:41,160
I must stay inside my
room out of shame

690
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,040
I was sexually abused

691
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,840
By finding out the culprit, I
will punish him and not the police

692
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,080
Again the same drama

693
01:06:26,840 --> 01:06:28,840
You gave me ten minutes time

694
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:30,600
I will give you fifteen minutes time

695
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:38,760
If you accept yourself,
I will shoot only one

696
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:42,560
Else, I will shoot both of you

697
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,480
I begged you a lot
Did you listen to me?

698
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:39,680
For your happiness,
you tortured me

699
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,000
For my happiness,
you must die

700
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,400
You told me to do
whatever I can, right?

701
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,360
Try to save yourself if you can

702
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,920
The fear of death is
seen in the face itself

703
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,240
You said you will come
But you didn't come

704
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,640
Won't I come if I tell you?
Don't torture me

705
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,560
- Are you drunk?
- Yes

706
01:08:38,800 --> 01:08:41,080
I think there is some problem
Shall I come?

707
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,480
No, I myself will come

708
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,560
- Come fast
- Okay

709
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,080
It's shaking like this

710
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,880
But he is drinking
without pouring down

711
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,920
By boozing more,
he spoilt his health

712
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:58,640
But my body is very strong

713
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:04,600
Ah! Why is it shaking like this?

714
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,720
Even if you drink lightly,
poison is the poison

715
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,920
Oh! I think it worked out

716
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,560
Even my legs are shaking

717
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:16,360
Just a quarter peg
My whole body is shaking

718
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:20,600
What is he doing?
He looks uneasy

719
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:22,840
Is it paining?

720
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,080
I don't know where
liver and kidney remain

721
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:29,400
Oh, did I lose liver or kidney?

722
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,760
First, I must check my body

723
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,400
There is one extreme case also

724
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:35,440
High risk sexual behavior person

725
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,440
Will I roam around as sex maniac?

726
01:09:39,120 --> 01:09:41,160
Looking at her,
I don't get the mood

727
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,160
By boozing, did I lose even that sense?

728
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,080
You will hear a sound as
if someone is whispering

729
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,520
I don't hear all that

730
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,120
Oh, I hear even that also
Let me hear

731
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:59,040
But why not am I hearing
AR Rahman song?

732
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:02,920
"Hamma Hamma Hamma
Hamma Hamma"

733
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:03,920
Thanks, God

734
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:08,040
"Hamma Hamma Hamma
Hamma Hamma"

735
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:10,640
Your phone is ringing, fool

736
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,440
- Who is it?
- John's uncle

737
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:18,800
He is my Uncle also

738
01:10:19,080 --> 01:10:20,680
He is your Uncle also

739
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,880
He is our Uncle

740
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,280
Put the phone in loudspeaker

741
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,920
Uncle will talk to me personally

742
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,240
Put it in speaker

743
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,840
You won't listen to what I say

744
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,560
Hey, Uncle!
What are you doing?

745
01:10:34,600 --> 01:10:37,200
These are the things to be done by
switching of the phone instead of on

746
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:38,400
Don't talk unknowingly

747
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:39,640
On one side,
dog is following me

748
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,080
On another side,
police is following me

749
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,320
Open the door

750
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,800
Uncle is there outside

751
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,720
Talk to him there itself
and send him back

752
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:54,320
Hey, open the door
Police is there outside

753
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,440
Husain, open the door

754
01:10:58,280 --> 01:11:00,360
Listen to me
Don't come in

755
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:03,360
Dog is chasing me
Please...Husain

756
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,280
Come later...you

757
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,880
For this only, you said
you won't allow me inside

758
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,840
Hey! If I bring anyone,
you will enjoy freely

759
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:25,240
But if you bring someone,
won't you show me?

760
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,280
Hey, Uncle!
You might die

761
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:29,080
I already died

762
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:35,000
The moment I saw her,
I am dead

763
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,040
Hey, you might have finished

764
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,680
Hey, I didn't do anything

765
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,960
You would have done, I know

766
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,160
He might have done
in silly manner

767
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:44,320
Am I right?

768
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:46,840
Enough of appreciating me
Appreciate Johny also

769
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,960
If he is of this type,
that guy is of another type

770
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:53,360
He might have acted rudely, right?

771
01:12:00,680 --> 01:12:02,160
Usually, she smells

772
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,440
Now he smelled her
and got caught

773
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:05,120
What a fate!

774
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,480
If you stop wearing modern
costume and start wearing sari...

775
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:13,640
...then a temple will be built for you
You will reach top level

776
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:17,200
Hey, Uncle! Even you
will reach top level

777
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:19,880
Okay...Okay

778
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,480
Paul Sir from Kerala

779
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,600
John, you are showing
off too much for this

780
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:33,680
But Paul Sir is going
from 1000 to 2000

781
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:36,880
Tell me, Sir

782
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,280
Is there Myna?

783
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:40,240
Myna is there inside the cage

784
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:42,200
Is it so?
Then what will I do?

785
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:45,040
There is one peacock here
She is a fresh piece

786
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,400
Piece? Fresh piece?
You rascal!

787
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,440
Last time also, you said
that you will send me a peacock

788
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,760
Only when she came here,
I realized that she is a crow

789
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,640
I will send this peacock
through mail

790
01:12:53,720 --> 01:12:55,480
After seeing her, you
send me the response

791
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:56,680
You send me, rascal

792
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,840
Peacock, pose for me so
that I'll mail your photo

793
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,600
If that Sir sees this mail,
he will book you immediately

794
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,400
Both of us can go to
that heaven then

795
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:08,280
Uncle, you are going to
meet God in heaven for sure

796
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,600
Get lost, fool

797
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:19,480
Ah! Paul Sir will
fall for this pose

798
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:21,000
I will take the snap

799
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,800
That's it

800
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,800
Hey, where did you find her?
She is shooting like this

801
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,520
Are you going
to shoot me, Peacock?

802
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,800
Will you tell about me outside?

803
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:54,440
I didn't come here
I didn't see anything

804
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:55,240
Get lost

805
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:02,240
Paul Sir is calling me
What should I tell him?

806
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,920
What Paul and fool?
Get lost

807
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:10,000
Oh God!
Please leave me

808
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:46,560
Since you wished, my father got you
dates liquor from foreign

809
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,840
For Ramzan, my friend
Rahmath gave mutton biryani

810
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,400
For Bakrid, he gave camel biryani

811
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,120
I gave them to you without eating

812
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:53,840
Just for that,
please accept this

813
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:56,960
I won't say about your company
with a girl like how you said

814
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:57,920
You are alone only

815
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,240
But my wife is there for me

816
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:01,720
I am going to die because of you
You better accept it

817
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:24,120
Mr. John

818
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:30,480
Who is that?

819
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:32,880
Who is that?

820
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:36,040
- Peter from CBI
- CBI?

821
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,400
- Crime branch
- He looks like a beggar

822
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,360
He is in disguise

823
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,320
Tortoises are smuggled
to Africa via ECR

824
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:44,520
To find out about that,
he is in undercover operation

825
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,440
He is telling Singam 2 film story

826
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,840
Then what?
Is his name Doraisingam?

827
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:50,840
No, his name is Peter
He is from CBI

828
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:56,840
"What a hunger it is?
What a hunger it is?"

829
01:16:01,640 --> 01:16:05,640
Mr. John! I am hungry
Please, I need a peg of liquor

830
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:07,920
CBI is asking to you
Give something to him

831
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:33,600
How did you get it?

832
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:37,040
It was there in
the backside of pub, that's all

833
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,440
Husain, bye

834
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:08,680
John! John! John!
Get up John! Get up

835
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:12,760
Hey, I will call the police

836
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,320
Thinking that I shouldn't get
caught, I deleted the photo

837
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,440
No mood

838
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,720
- Do you need a drink?
- Yes

839
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:47,320
- Then, come and dance
- Okay

840
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,120
Oh! I slapped her

841
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,680
I don't know
what happened after that

842
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,600
She has a gun also

843
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:17,240
She will shoot

844
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:52,160
- Have it
- No need

845
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:53,680
We might fight

846
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,040
After boozing,
we will forget

847
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,120
This problem arose due to
memory loss after boozing

848
01:18:57,160 --> 01:18:59,080
- I don't want
- I should forget

849
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:05,000
- Friends
- Friends

850
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:18,280
Come

851
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:33,640
We are didn't commit any mistake

852
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:36,400
For someone else mistake,
why should we die?

853
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:37,120
You are right

854
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,000
I think she will put us
behind the bars by complaining

855
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,320
But I think she might kill us

856
01:19:42,680 --> 01:19:46,480
Before that, we will kill us, okay?

857
01:19:47,360 --> 01:19:48,280
How?

858
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:51,600
By chopping her into pieces,
we will fry her as tandoori item

859
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:53,160
She has a gun

860
01:19:56,280 --> 01:19:58,040
Politician's idea will be right

861
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,480
- Hey, don't tell me to hold her leg
- We will pull her legs

862
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:22,720
Go

863
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:31,120
I will steady my mind

864
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,440
Hey, she might shoot
Why not we find some other idea?

865
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:40,520
You go

866
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,880
Charu! Get up

867
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,280
- I want to hold
- What?

868
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:58,120
Your legs
Please

869
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:07,280
For the mistake that
occurred, I promise

870
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,200
I'm not the only one
responsible for that

871
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,880
What a scene you created?

872
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,040
If I press the trigger,
you will die

873
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,440
What are you talking?
There is no time

874
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,560
You should chop her into pieces
I must light the stove

875
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,080
We need to boil her
Shoot her fast

876
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:33,720
Wait

877
01:21:33,800 --> 01:21:36,640
She tortured us by
asking who committed that

878
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,360
Why should we leave it in confusion?
Let's confirm it

879
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,000
Hey, it's not there in our plan

880
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:44,000
You threw the gun correctly
So, it's a surprise for you

881
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,120
- You enjoy that R
- I don't want that R

882
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:51,680
You are getting scared
First me, next you, okay?

883
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,960
Remove it
I'm telling you to remove

884
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:15,000
Oh! Oh!! I didn't see

885
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,880
Hey, lift it
Else, I will shoot you

886
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,920
Shoot me

887
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:29,960
Shoot me

888
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,280
Hey, fool! Don't you know to shoot?

889
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,680
- Hey, she is nearing us
- I told you to shoot

890
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:36,920
She came near us
You pull the trigger

891
01:22:56,960 --> 01:22:58,880
If someone gets cheated...

892
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:00,960
...you will lie down upon her
and show your bravery

893
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:04,360
Only once, I remained unconscious
Not again

894
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:03,080
Hi, Honey!
Tell me where I am

895
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:04,720
In London

896
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:06,680
No, in Chennai airport

897
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:09,200
I said that will be back
one day before wedding

898
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,960
But see, I came one week before

899
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,440
I am coming to meet you only
Come on, get ready

900
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,000
No, don't come

901
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:16,640
Are you sleeping...?

902
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:19,760
You need not come
Drop this marriage plan

903
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,120
Hey, are you mad?

904
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:22,560
Our marriage will
take place in one week

905
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,520
You are asking me to call off
this wedding at this moment

906
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:26,360
- Are you in senses?
- Yes

907
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,960
I am not the right girl for you

908
01:24:30,640 --> 01:24:32,560
Hereafter, don't call me

909
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,160
Don't try to meet me

910
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:57,080
- Is your marriage fixed?
- Yes

911
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,400
Charu, it doesn't matter

912
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,640
Charu, what John said is right
You marry him and be happy

913
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:08,160
Then only, we will
also remain happy

914
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,120
Get lost

915
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:13,040
Like you both, I can't
cheat anyone and live

916
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:16,040
75% of people in society
cheat each other and survive

917
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:17,320
But I can't

918
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:21,320
I remained happy
from the moment I met him

919
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,280
I spent my entire
age in orphanage

920
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:29,480
One person adopted me
and remained fond of me

921
01:25:29,720 --> 01:25:34,440
But he is a drunkard
He told me to booze for a company

922
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:36,600
I denied
He beat me

923
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,680
He compelled me
He made me drink

924
01:25:40,840 --> 01:25:42,680
It continued like that for some days

925
01:25:42,720 --> 01:25:46,440
On one fine day, he drank a lot
and approached me sexually

926
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:50,320
I poked his thigh with
a knife and escaped

927
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:54,120
I tried a lot to stop drinking

928
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:56,000
I started concentrating
on my education

929
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:57,280
I joined IT

930
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:01,880
But in the name of social drinking,
it was very common

931
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,880
I liked it
He saw me there only

932
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:07,800
He is very genuine

933
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:09,720
He said he know
everything about me

934
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:13,680
He proposed me to marry
I liked his approach

935
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,360
He asked only one request
He wanted me to stop drinking

936
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,520
I thought I might die by
remaining as orphan till the end

937
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:23,800
I wanted to live for him

938
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,160
I told him that I will drink
for the last time

939
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:27,360
He said okay

940
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,200
But you spoilt my life

941
01:26:36,680 --> 01:26:38,200
I lost him

942
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:34,400
- Do you need a drink?
- Yes

943
01:27:35,040 --> 01:27:37,240
Then, will you dance with me?

944
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,640
You look very beautiful

945
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,680
You are lying out
of intoxication

946
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:54,320
I can say the truth
only out of intoxication

947
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,160
You are very beautiful
I will show you that

948
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,680
Just one time

949
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:47,600
Just one time

950
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,520
I tried to misbehave with you

951
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,600
But I don't know what
happened after that

952
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,200
Why didn't you tell me first?

953
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:50,600
The moment I saw your chain,
I remembered, I promise

954
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,640
I might have told you
You won't have believed me

955
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:56,080
Please Charmi, I need my life
Please don't shoot me

956
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:00,160
Life? You drink till you
become fully intoxicated

957
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:02,320
You are roaming around
whether you will find anyone

958
01:30:02,360 --> 01:30:04,720
You are an animal who
don't consider others feelings

959
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:06,880
Do you need such
a disgusting life?

960
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:09,360
You are a zero in life

961
01:30:15,880 --> 01:30:17,040
Zero?

962
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,080
Am I a zero?

963
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:23,200
In this same life,
I remained as hero once

964
01:30:23,240 --> 01:30:26,400
Whoever commits mistake in our village
they will be advised by elders

965
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,320
Those elders consider me as
role model for a perfect guy

966
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,000
I lived such a great life

967
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:33,480
I was born in a family where
drinking was considered as wrong

968
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,120
My parents had big
dreams about my future

969
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,800
Till the completion of 12th standard
I was also a righteous man

970
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,200
I went to college
My life got changed

971
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,160
Do you know?
I sing very well

972
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,120
In college competition...

973
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:56,000
"Did I hear a music with lyrics?"

974
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:59,640
"It is constantly playing in my heart"

975
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:05,040
"Daily without sleep my
heart is immersed in sorrow"

976
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:10,480
"I'm constantly searching to
communicate with happiness"

977
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:16,760
"Oh dear! These are the thousand joys"

978
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:20,720
I won, friends had booze and enjoyed

979
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:26,880
They told me also to drink
I said no

980
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:29,720
Second time they told me that it is
only bear and nothing will happen

981
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,200
I thought about it

982
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:33,360
But third time they told
me that it'll be thrilling

983
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:34,760
I couldn't say no

984
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,840
There was a curiosity
inside me that what was in that

985
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:45,040
I had drink

986
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,000
It was really thrilling

987
01:31:47,240 --> 01:31:49,960
I was constantly talking about
the same matter which was of no value

988
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,200
I fought with policeman

989
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:54,880
In sentiment I fed biryani to dog

990
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,560
There was real enjoyment
I was in a different world

991
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,920
Something inside me kept telling
that I should remain in that world

992
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,880
Is there any lacking for
the reason in our country to booze?

993
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:09,240
In India Pakistan match
I boozed as India won

994
01:32:09,280 --> 01:32:12,680
I boozed because in wine shop they
charged extra Rs 5 for a quarter alcohol

995
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,680
I boozed because there
was hike in petrol price

996
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,760
I boozed because super
star's movie became a hit

997
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,400
I kept searching for some reason

998
01:32:18,440 --> 01:32:21,360
I boozed because I couldn't get
ticket for my favorite hero's movie

999
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,960
Next I started to create reasons

1000
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,600
Feeling bad that this
world is like this I boozed

1001
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:27,080
Open the gate

1002
01:32:27,200 --> 01:32:28,920
After a limit

1003
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,280
I couldn't remain
without drinking

1004
01:32:41,840 --> 01:32:44,000
If the body has
to remain normal

1005
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:49,880
I had to drink

1006
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,400
I boozed

1007
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,160
I asked money
from everyone I saw

1008
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:58,280
I did all that which
I can't tell outside

1009
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:05,560
I got insulted

1010
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:19,640
Only when I drank
the leftover of the others

1011
01:33:19,680 --> 01:33:21,720
I had lost
the self-confidence...

1012
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,120
...and self-respect which my
parent's had taught me

1013
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,360
I realized

1014
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:38,600
"Enough go away,
you are killing me daily"

1015
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:44,640
"You daily associated like a friend"

1016
01:33:44,760 --> 01:33:50,920
"Slowly as days went
by you changed me"

1017
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:57,320
"There was a fight
whether it was you or me"

1018
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:27,760
"You gave me happiness
by making me a slave"

1019
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:33,160
"You gave me courage
by making me useless"

1020
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:39,320
"You made me float
You made me drown"

1021
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:45,920
"You made me laugh
You grinded me"

1022
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:52,080
"I'm also living a little bit"

1023
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:58,880
"Due to you I lost everything here"

1024
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,080
Father didn't come out of the house

1025
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:03,800
Mother cried from inside

1026
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:05,040
I felt bad

1027
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,080
I stopped

1028
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,440
I got scared thinking about life

1029
01:35:11,480 --> 01:35:14,040
Without drinking and roaming
around I had no confidence

1030
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,920
That time I used to dupe
someone and have a peg

1031
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,520
Then I'll get a confidence
I'll feel that life is easy

1032
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,520
To remain confident
I required drinks regularly

1033
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,960
I knew that my family
can't remain peaceful

1034
01:35:28,840 --> 01:35:31,400
But they'll remain
without feeling ashamed

1035
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:32,680
I left

1036
01:35:39,080 --> 01:35:41,920
I came to Chennai
I did many kinds of jobs

1037
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,120
Even then the money was not enough
to booze till I became intoxicated

1038
01:35:45,160 --> 01:35:48,840
I worked only to booze, then
why not work in a drinking place?

1039
01:35:49,080 --> 01:35:50,400
So I joined a pub

1040
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:55,240
My lifestyle got changed
I earned a lot

1041
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,120
I did many mistakes

1042
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,120
My mother came in my dream

1043
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,120
I don't even know
whether she is alive or dead

1044
01:36:04,160 --> 01:36:07,800
I had a guilty feel that
I didn't do anything for her

1045
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,760
I started to hate myself

1046
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:13,040
I decided that I had
enough of this life

1047
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:16,880
It was at that time in
my life that Divya came

1048
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:21,080
Divya, it is me I told you

1049
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,680
Only once

1050
01:36:22,720 --> 01:36:24,320
After that I
won't compel you

1051
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:25,160
Please, Divya

1052
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,840
I'll SMS the place
where you have to come

1053
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:28,360
You must come in ten minutes time

1054
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:32,560
Divya, I must remain happy
Else you can't remain happy

1055
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,640
I didn't do anything for my family

1056
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:37,960
But I felt that I must
do something for her

1057
01:36:42,160 --> 01:36:43,280
Hey, Divya!

1058
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,560
Who are you, man?

1059
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,000
My girlfriend is on the way, man

1060
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,280
Go...go

1061
01:36:50,680 --> 01:36:53,200
- Whose phone is it ringing?
- It's my phone, what's your problem?

1062
01:36:53,240 --> 01:36:54,960
Then it is you who has
got to be beaten

1063
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,960
- That is my phone
- Okay

1064
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,400
Tell me the address
I'll send it

1065
01:37:02,480 --> 01:37:03,920
No, I need to meet you

1066
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:05,440
- For what?
- Please

1067
01:37:26,760 --> 01:37:28,640
He fell on my feet and begged

1068
01:37:28,720 --> 01:37:30,880
He ran away saying
he won't come near me

1069
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,280
Now is it okay?

1070
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:34,720
Now I'm very happy

1071
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,520
Because of you

1072
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:40,400
First time a girl
was happy due to me

1073
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:46,480
Whenever I saw Divya
struggling inside me got became silent

1074
01:37:46,520 --> 01:37:49,440
In the place where liquor was
drunk she was drinking cool drinks

1075
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:51,440
I knew that she was
coming to see me

1076
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:53,080
She kept seeing me

1077
01:37:53,960 --> 01:37:55,280
She made me grumble

1078
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:56,600
I love you

1079
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,080
I couldn't say that I too love you

1080
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,760
There was so much dirt inside me

1081
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,680
But I didn't have
the heart to leave her

1082
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:05,400
They say that love
can change everything

1083
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:08,240
I realized that it was
true only when it came to me

1084
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:09,560
I stopped boozing

1085
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:11,440
It was only then that
I wanted to drink more

1086
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,680
I took treatment

1087
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,160
I became a new man

1088
01:38:17,880 --> 01:38:18,960
I love you

1089
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:46,640
"Your eyes comes out to see me"

1090
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:52,760
"Oh, that loves respects even me
also and stand in front of me"

1091
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:58,920
"What a rain!
Inside my heart"

1092
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:04,880
"What a wave!
What to say?"

1093
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:10,560
"In your love, I got flattered"

1094
01:39:10,640 --> 01:39:16,640
"You are the one
who made me smile"

1095
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:22,960
"You also thought me to
admire things around me"

1096
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:25,920
What do you like?

1097
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,080
I'm very happy

1098
01:39:27,120 --> 01:39:28,880
I wish to do something for you

1099
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:31,520
I desire to see
John Pennycuick's memorial

1100
01:39:32,720 --> 01:39:34,960
It is due to him that
5 districts are surviving

1101
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,440
Each person here has got a God

1102
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,640
But he is a God to everyone

1103
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,880
'Till there is water you'll remain alive'

1104
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,640
A new life started...

1105
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,400
...with Divya

1106
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:05,440
"My body will be nothing
but your lip lines"

1107
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:11,880
"My life will be nothing
but your life line"

1108
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:18,120
"Without sleeping,
if we talk more and more"

1109
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:23,960
"The whole night will sleep then"

1110
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:29,560
"A game will be played
with the help of these dice"

1111
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:42,080
"Interestingly, we played it
interestingly, we enjoyed it"

1112
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,760
I didn't tell her that I'm a drinker

1113
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,240
It is not because that I feared
she'll leave me if she comes to know

1114
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:48,680
It was the faith that the love that

1115
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:51,800
I had for her will not
make me go in that path

1116
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:55,560
Whenever I had the urge to drink,
I used to eat full meals

1117
01:40:56,520 --> 01:41:00,360
On stopping drinks everyone
will feel happy except one

1118
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,200
The one who drinks regularly with us

1119
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:03,560
He can't bear it

1120
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,640
He'll get angry

1121
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:05,800
He'll boil with rage

1122
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:09,240
He'll even do black magic
to make us booze again

1123
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:12,040
But he mixed it in
cook drink and gave me

1124
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:14,880
The minute I had a drop
I recognized the taste

1125
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:16,640
I couldn't drop the bottle

1126
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,840
Satan got hold of me

1127
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,280
Life took a turn

1128
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:23,560
Divya came to know

1129
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:24,760
Why did you hide it from me?

1130
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:25,720
No, Divya

1131
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,120
Listen to what I have to say

1132
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:28,880
- I'm leaving
- She left me

1133
01:41:30,440 --> 01:41:32,000
This is your last warning

1134
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:34,400
She warned me not to drink

1135
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:35,960
I couldn't help it

1136
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:41,880
"Everything is here is for few days"

1137
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:47,960
"The circle will end
from where it started"

1138
01:41:48,120 --> 01:41:54,400
"For everything here
there is magical appearance"

1139
01:41:54,480 --> 01:42:00,400
"Only ongoing
through we'll understand"

1140
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:06,480
"On top of the path
the journey will go on"

1141
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:12,120
"But the path will
never move from there"

1142
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:18,240
"I turned around and stood
You made me roam around"

1143
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:25,280
"I came alive
You took away my life"

1144
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,880
Due to my drinking habit
there was fight between us

1145
01:42:27,960 --> 01:42:29,760
I'll do like this
One day I hit her

1146
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:32,640
I felt that I did wrong by hitting her

1147
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:34,280
In tension I boozed more

1148
01:42:34,320 --> 01:42:36,040
I went to say sorry to Divya

1149
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,520
Morning I was in hospital

1150
01:42:42,600 --> 01:42:46,200
Doctor told me that I did accident
and killed two people

1151
01:42:46,280 --> 01:42:48,560
I didn't understand anything
I couldn't even believe it

1152
01:42:48,600 --> 01:42:50,400
You are in a black out
stage of drunkenness

1153
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:53,880
People in this stage can't remember
what they did in drunken stage

1154
01:42:55,520 --> 01:43:00,160
My innocent wife took lot of
trouble to save me from court and case

1155
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:06,280
I must look after her well
I wanted this life

1156
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,280
I didn't do that mistake

1157
01:43:15,400 --> 01:43:17,680
In blackout stage I might have done it

1158
01:43:17,720 --> 01:43:18,680
Sorry

1159
01:43:18,760 --> 01:43:20,000
Don't shoot me

1160
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:23,120
You'll say that you
raped me in blackout stage

1161
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:24,600
You want me to forgive that

1162
01:43:24,680 --> 01:43:29,080
By telling an emotional story
are you trying to escape sentimentally?

1163
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,640
You can remain as a sentiment idiot

1164
01:43:31,760 --> 01:43:33,040
I'm not a one

1165
01:43:48,240 --> 01:43:49,480
Hey!

1166
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:02,520
Charu, please don't shoot

1167
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:13,400
- Who is she?
- John's wife

1168
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:25,640
I have decided to take just your life

1169
01:44:26,200 --> 01:44:29,040
If you try to convey
anything to her

1170
01:44:29,840 --> 01:44:33,760
I'll condemn your
body parts and leave you alive

1171
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,920
You'll lead an atrocious life

1172
01:44:39,040 --> 01:44:39,920
Go

1173
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:03,640
What happened, Husain?

1174
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:05,520
Where is John?

1175
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:18,200
What happened, John?

1176
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:19,520
Get up, John

1177
01:45:27,080 --> 01:45:28,720
Who hit you?

1178
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:31,240
It is me
who hit him

1179
01:45:35,720 --> 01:45:37,600
Why did you hit him?

1180
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:40,320
Mind your words
He raped me

1181
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:41,880
That is why
I hit him

1182
01:45:45,320 --> 01:45:46,400
No chance

1183
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:47,920
He won't do like that

1184
01:45:49,080 --> 01:45:52,120
He'll drink too much
Get angry and fight

1185
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,800
But he won't touch
any other girl than me

1186
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:58,240
Are you that confident?

1187
01:45:58,360 --> 01:45:59,680
Ask him

1188
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,160
John say as no

1189
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,040
Say as no, John

1190
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,840
Say as no, John

1191
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:15,280
Please!

1192
01:46:15,320 --> 01:46:16,920
Say as no

1193
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:19,040
I don't know, Divya

1194
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:22,400
I don't know

1195
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:34,680
From the second I loved you

1196
01:46:34,760 --> 01:46:37,240
I sacrificed my life for you

1197
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:41,080
You have not done anything
for me even a single day...

1198
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:44,040
...a single minute
or a single second

1199
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:49,800
Many times you have come drunk
and behaved like an animal in bed

1200
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:52,360
Have I ever said no even once?

1201
01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:55,360
For your sake and your
happiness I tolerated

1202
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:59,400
Because I loved you that much

1203
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:03,760
Now I'm boring
to you in bed, isn't it?

1204
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,800
That is why you left

1205
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:11,800
It is a waste to remain
as your life partner

1206
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:24,040
Sorry

1207
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:27,320
I understand your feelings

1208
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,880
I myself will phone for the police

1209
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:42,080
Hey!

1210
01:47:42,280 --> 01:47:43,520
Cut the phone call

1211
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:48,600
I'm telling you to cut the call

1212
01:47:48,680 --> 01:47:50,360
I must only kill him

1213
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:52,400
Cut the phone call

1214
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:55,840
Divya, cut the phone call
She'll shoot

1215
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:00,240
Do you love her that much?

1216
01:48:02,040 --> 01:48:03,000
Come here

1217
01:48:04,640 --> 01:48:05,840
No

1218
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,640
No Charu

1219
01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:13,240
Rape her

1220
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,360
What are you seeing?

1221
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:18,600
Do it

1222
01:48:20,120 --> 01:48:22,920
Husain, no

1223
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:23,960
Don't harm her

1224
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,760
The problem is between both of us

1225
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:27,160
Don't harm her

1226
01:48:27,880 --> 01:48:31,160
She has done a lot for me life
I have done nothing for her

1227
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:32,800
Please, leave her, Charu

1228
01:48:33,680 --> 01:48:35,680
If it happens to me, take it easy

1229
01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:37,600
If it happens to your wife, it is pain

1230
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,720
You must realize my pain

1231
01:48:39,960 --> 01:48:41,280
Hey, Husain

1232
01:48:41,680 --> 01:48:43,160
No

1233
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,640
I'm totally irritated

1234
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:47,840
Okay I'll do it

1235
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:48,960
I'll do it

1236
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,200
That time itself
I said we'll go

1237
01:48:51,280 --> 01:48:52,360
Did you listen?

1238
01:48:57,200 --> 01:48:58,280
Don't do

1239
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:02,840
Go

1240
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:05,320
- Go back
- I'll go

1241
01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:08,920
Rape her

1242
01:49:10,600 --> 01:49:11,760
Come on

1243
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:14,320
She is my friend's wife

1244
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:15,880
I don't have the mood

1245
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,920
You drink alcohol
You'll get the mood

1246
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:31,160
Listen to me

1247
01:49:31,400 --> 01:49:35,680
Don't listen to her, Husain
She is tuning you wrongly

1248
01:49:35,720 --> 01:49:37,280
No, wait

1249
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,320
No Husain

1250
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:41,120
Look at me

1251
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:45,120
Look at me
Don't touch that thing, Husain

1252
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:46,880
Listen to me

1253
01:49:47,680 --> 01:49:50,000
Hey, don't drink that

1254
01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:52,000
No...don't drink

1255
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:06,600
Enough of drinking
Come and enjoy

1256
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:15,480
No

1257
01:50:15,600 --> 01:50:16,880
No, Husain

1258
01:50:17,200 --> 01:50:18,600
No, Husain

1259
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:22,160
Please!
No, Husain

1260
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,440
What a beauty?

1261
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,800
Is she more beautiful than me?

1262
01:50:36,920 --> 01:50:38,160
What else do you feel?

1263
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,520
When he has such
a beautiful wife

1264
01:50:40,840 --> 01:50:42,480
Why did he rape you?

1265
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:45,000
That is what I feel Fool

1266
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:48,680
Alcohol has made you also talk

1267
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,720
No

1268
01:50:57,800 --> 01:50:59,520
Hey, I'm your friend

1269
01:51:00,440 --> 01:51:02,280
Are you a friend?

1270
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,160
A friend must sacrifice
his life and save

1271
01:51:05,240 --> 01:51:08,400
For the mistake done by you, you
tried to trap me and finish me

1272
01:51:08,480 --> 01:51:10,160
Are you a friend?

1273
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:14,960
Alcohol inside
and woman outside

1274
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:16,960
Nearby friend

1275
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,680
What a life is this?

1276
01:51:18,760 --> 01:51:20,600
Correct, Husain
Come on

1277
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:22,800
I'm in a romantic mood

1278
01:51:28,120 --> 01:51:29,520
No, Husain

1279
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:35,320
It is nothing, Divya

1280
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:37,160
It is nothing

1281
01:51:37,240 --> 01:51:38,400
Go

1282
01:51:40,680 --> 01:51:41,680
Let her

1283
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:43,560
- She might shoot
- Leave her

1284
01:51:43,640 --> 01:51:44,880
Come on, Divya

1285
01:51:46,120 --> 01:51:47,440
Let her go

1286
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:13,360
Go

1287
01:52:16,240 --> 01:52:17,320
Go

1288
01:52:17,400 --> 01:52:18,680
Cha!
Get lost

1289
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:23,880
What else do you need?

1290
01:52:25,760 --> 01:52:27,160
I asked sorry

1291
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,000
But you are torturing me
like a sadist

1292
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,520
Are you a psycho?

1293
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:35,680
You...

1294
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:01,560
John, relax

1295
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:04,520
You didn't do this

1296
01:55:04,600 --> 01:55:06,320
Nothing like that took place

1297
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:11,520
Yes, we organized a play

1298
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,320
She is also a doctor

1299
01:55:25,880 --> 01:55:26,960
No

1300
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:30,320
- Can we start the play?
- Sure

1301
01:55:32,520 --> 01:55:35,920
Doctor, as we planned
John started to follow you

1302
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:42,720
You offered me a drink
But I was clear

1303
01:55:51,440 --> 01:55:53,720
In order to escape,
I tried to beat you

1304
01:56:02,240 --> 01:56:03,960
But you got fainted

1305
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:14,120
You were in bed
Husain made you sit in chair

1306
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:18,040
After that, our play got started

1307
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:25,760
Don't think no one
knows what you are doing

1308
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:27,800
Everyone is seeing

1309
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:34,840
Your wife came and met us
in alcoholics anonymous

1310
01:56:34,920 --> 01:56:37,120
She informed us whatever
you did during...

1311
01:56:37,200 --> 01:56:39,200
...blackout stage out of
alcohol intoxication

1312
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:41,400
She tolerated all that

1313
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:45,600
But she is unable to tolerate
your bad deeds in ladies matter

1314
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:50,440
She realized that you are
doing that mistake due to alcohol

1315
01:56:50,520 --> 01:56:51,800
She needs you

1316
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:54,400
She begged us to save
you from alcohol

1317
01:56:55,960 --> 01:56:58,520
For the past two months,
we all together planned this

1318
01:56:58,600 --> 01:57:03,480
As we planned, your blackout
stage worked in our plan

1319
01:57:03,560 --> 01:57:06,440
To make you understand
what you did due to alcohol

1320
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:10,360
To make you realize about the danger
due to alcohol consumption

1321
01:57:10,440 --> 01:57:13,040
We recorded the entire episode

1322
01:57:13,120 --> 01:57:14,440
We are going to telecast also

1323
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:19,040
We believe that at least 5%
people will reform by watching this

1324
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,840
Alcohol addiction is not
a non-curable disease

1325
01:57:22,920 --> 01:57:25,920
Like TB, Typhoid and Malaria,
it's an ordinary disease

1326
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,000
If there are doctor's
treatment and relatives support

1327
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:30,400
It's easier to treat

1328
01:57:30,440 --> 01:57:33,920
You felt bad that you were not
able to do anything for your parents

1329
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:37,160
The moment your wife
knew about you wholly

1330
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:39,920
She started taking
good care of your parents

1331
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:45,960
You should do something good to her

1332
01:57:46,040 --> 01:57:48,080
Throw away the liquors
Come for treatment

1333
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:50,560
You will get back
your disciplined life

1334
01:57:50,640 --> 01:57:51,760
Come on, John
