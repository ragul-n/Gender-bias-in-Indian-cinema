00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If anyone of us goes then our way to go school will open

6
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Or we all will have to wear the pants of Hooda's sir

7
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Who is Gurinder Singh?

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Glenn McGrath bowling speed is less than Shane Bond and Brett Lee

9
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
But Do you know how he takes wicket?

10
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000

21
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Student's of tejpur corporation?

23
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000

25
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sir! it's means that we all got selected?

27
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I didn't say you're selected

28
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I didn't even say that you're not selected

29
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Go and practice

30
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
and listen

31
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
See

32
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This old bat,old pad.This will not be work here.

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I mean, purchase new clothes, new shoes and new kit.

34
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This is not street cricket.

35
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We're making indian under-16 cricket team
Got it now?

36
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
increase your standard

37
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Now go

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
As soon as my cricketer's don't play, you like the performance of other's cricketer's

39
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Didn't you? Mehta

40
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
This is just formality, as well as why would i like to take cricket trails of royal heritage?

41
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If i have the authority then i will take your school cricket team as indian under-16 cricket team

42
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
By the way, this isn't a bad suggestion

43
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Forget this

44
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I heard a rumour that you're leaving royal heritage school and you will go to UK soon

45
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah! I got a cricket coach offer from a UK University

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's great

47
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
There were waiting for me for a long time, so i decided to join them.

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
So what will happen to your kids?

49
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And you're inter cricket school championship is also coming.

50
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So who will replace you?

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Harry Oberoi?

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Maybe

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
And Mehta,my kids can win school cricket championship without any coach

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah! I can see that

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
There's no doubt about that

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Alright! Let's go

57
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yeah! Sure, come 

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000

00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Run fast 

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Looks like we will get punished today

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Drop your accessories here

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Come on! Let's go

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Student's open your books

00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Sir! Which topic were we studying yesterday?

68
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sir! Can we come in?

70
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Come in, come in

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You have missed only two periods.

72
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Huh

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You should've come later

74
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Huh

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Veeru! Hey Veeru
-Why

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What happened in the cricket trails selection?
-By the way, you guys don't need education

77
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Huh

78
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Go and live your own life.

79
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Do more fun

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And if your heart says then come to school

81
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Hmmmm

82
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Where are you going?

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Huh?
-To become a rooster

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
To become a rooster?

85
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I will not make you a rooster today, but i will make you a donkey.

86
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Alright! then

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Mahipal!

88
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
These fools come for study or to have fun

89
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's see what is written here

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Did you get selected?

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Come! you are also selected

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Come! and become a rooster with your friends

93
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But sir, what did i do?

94
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I was just----

95
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You want to become a rooster or i will turn you into a peacock

96
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Shut up!

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Come in the line

98
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Come! come

99
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Come on! open your notebooks

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You just laugh

101
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
And write it neatly

102
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sachin Tendulkar also used to become a rooster in school.

103
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
No! he was naive

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He would've used to become a rooster because of vinod kambli
-Same as me because of you guys

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Shit! Shut up you fools

106
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
He looks very confused, he make us rooster and saying that we're fools

107
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Tell me what happened there?

108
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
First ball was bouncer

109
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I thought that i'm gone

110
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The next ball was on off stump

111
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I went on the back-foot and i cutted it.

112
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It went to four 

113
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Wow! wow, what a shot that was

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Then i get some confidence

115
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I said the bowler: ''come and i'll face you''

116
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Then what, this square-cut, this hook, that six, and that four

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
You should ask shakeel

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Wow! that's great

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I also would've come with you guys

120
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I would've killed very one
-What do you say

121
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Fool! why didn't you come?
Did your buffalo stop you?

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Yeah! my buffalo got sick

123
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Dad said me to take her to the doctor

124
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What would i do?

125
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Not only your buffalo, your fate is also sick

126
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hey!

127
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hey! Listen who were those kids who were standing with us?

128
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Seems like they were from a rich school

129
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Do you know---
-Forget all this

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Where is your selection letter?

131
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Why would we need any selection letter?
-Coach said us to come on 11th,means that our selection is done

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Come on! let's take a piss

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
So, you guys are good now

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I should've also come 

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now, you all will become stars

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What will i do?

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hey! Listen

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Come on! Let's go, it's time for sir hooda's class

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What is the most powerful sport?

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Kushti(Wrestling)

141
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You come here

142
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
For how many days since you're doing kushti(wrestling)?

143
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
4 Months

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
So, it will take 4 years for you to wear your pants properly?

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Huh
-Sorry Sir

146
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Sorry sir

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Which one of you doesn't wear pants today?

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Mahinder!

149
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Where are you?

150
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes sir

151
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Do i have to fasten your pants
-Why

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Who will check whether the wrestler have wore pants or not?

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I tell them everytime but they don't hear me

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Slap everyone of them

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Then we will see how it works for them

156
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
From now on, which ever wrestler of you who comes here without wearing pants 
-so i will wore pants to every family member of that wrestler.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Now start the training

158
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
And one more thing

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I have heard that someone's of you have the fever of playing cricket

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Take care of this matter or i will have to fix it

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Our school is champion of kushti(wrestling)

162
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
And until i'm here then there will be only kushti(wrestling) here 

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
He started it again

164
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
In next life, i will become a dog and he will become a electrical pole

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
What is actually in cricket?

166
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Every single guy in this village or city sits behind tv for watching cricket

167
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Do you remember our spiritual sports?

168
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Kushti(Wrestling), Kabaadi, Kho-Kho and Hockey

169
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
These are our motherland sports

170
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Now you all go in the wrestling ring

171
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Mahinder! Take them to wrestling ring

172
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
So everyone is ready for this match

173
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
First of all, i tell you that this is not a One day International(ODI) match but it's a full Test Match

174
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He wanted to catch it but got missed

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't forget that mahipal is also experienced in catching

176
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
And he has missed it
-Jeetu has completely missed it

177
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And mahipal has picked it and it's a drive

178
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Mahipal has played well and we have won this match

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Yeah! Lord, we have won this match
-Who is here?

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Hey! Navjot Singh Sindhu son?

181
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
If hooda sir will see or hear this then he will kill you

182
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Go and do some exercise

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Want to be a commentator?

184
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You guys also go

185
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Our son is an engineer

186
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He has been getting wedding invitation's from big places

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He also got wedding invitation of head of tehsil councillor's daughter

188
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They were taking about many big accessories

189
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But we have also said that our daughter goes to rich house
-while our bride comes to poor house

190
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Here comes my nephew

191
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Put it here dear

192
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You look very naive from your looks

193
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Go

194
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
And his brother(veeru) has also come

195
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
He studies in 9th class

196
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Go and touch the feets of our sister's husband

197
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hey! Don't be shy
-Namaste(Hello)

198
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
His sister loves him

199
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Sister

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You didn't even ate anything

201
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Sister

00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So what do i need to do?
-Dance?

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why are you in such bad mood?

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
If you didn't liked that man that refuse this wedding purposal

206
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Do you have headache?
-Can i cure you?

207
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Don't make me angry
-Ask whatever thing you want and then go

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Sister! My cricket bat, cricket pads are old now, so can you purchase new cricket kit for me?

209
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I promise that this is for the last time
-i will not take anything from you after this

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Only one?
-you have purchase 10 

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
My name is not bani, i'm birla

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I already said you in the morning to come home early

213
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wedding Invitation family is coming to see her

214
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You must have playing cricket

215
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
When she will go to her new house after marriage then how will take care of this house?

216
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
This time my heart says that this marriage is done

217
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Their boy is an engineer, they belong to a naive family

218
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
For the last 5 months, these are the naive family members

219
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Speak slowly
-Don't now when will you understand

220
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I understand everything, but when will you understand me?
-Tell aunt that i can't take this anymore

221
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I hate this drama, i don't want to marry anyone

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Hey! Aunt always think good for all of us

223
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hey! Listen to me, please

224
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You would be thinking that what will happen to us when you're gone

225
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm here and we also have veeru
-When responsibilities will come then he will managed us

226
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Now you take care of yourself

227
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Hey! You guys are talking here, and those people are leaving now

228
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Coming
-Come fast

229
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Ok! Sister

230
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We really enjoyed your company here

231
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Ok! Sister, now we're leaving

232
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
So when will you inform us

233
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
First of all, ravi's grandfather will see the horoscope
-if he find the combination then we will inform you

234
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Ok! Good bye
-Good bye

235
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There were many cricketers there in the cricket trails, they all had expensive cricket kits.

236
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I got selected with this cricket bat

237
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
If i would've had new cricket bat then i would've hit maximum sixes

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Didn't i?
-I know that you're not sleeping

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Sister! can you hear me?

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Sister! Wake up
-I'm warning you that i'll slap you

241
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Let me sleep

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Coach said me to buy a new cricket bat

243
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Now, this bat is gone

244
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
He also said me to buy cricket kit

245
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Looks like i have to make an excuse

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The guy that came to see you, does he play cricket?

247
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You don't think of any other thing except cricket

248
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
No

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
My heart says to play cricket every day and night
-Just cricket

250
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Imagine if i got selected in indian under-16 cricket team
-Maybe we'll get to see indian cricket selectors

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
And then who knows Yuvraj Singh, Ms Dhoni ask me for your marriage.

252
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Harbhajan Singh is not married and Mohammad Kaif is also virgin

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Sister! Think about it

254
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Sister! Buy a new cricket kit for me

255
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You're my bani, birla and bank

256
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Ok! Take 200 Rs from my purse
-Only 200 Rs?

257
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I want a cricket kit, not a picture of cricket kit

258
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Do you even know the meaning of a cricket kit?

259
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
One helmet, shoe, pad, arm guard

260
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
And one solid cricket bat with a solid grip

261
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Cricket bat which is like water, this is called complete cricket kit

262
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
So, how much will it cost for your cricket kit?

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
3000 Rs

264
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What?
-How much?

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000

00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
4000 Rs?
-Are you out of your mind?

267
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Hello! See me

268
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Do you even know how much is the value of 4000 Rs?

269
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Cricket kit will not come less than 4000 Rs
-So,does any doctor said you to play cricket?

270
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Mom says that you will take care of this house when i'm gone
-Now you shut up and sleep

272
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
If you again talk about cricket or cricket kit then i will tell mom

273
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Hey! Veeru
-Hey! Run Gurinder

Why were you saying me that you will clean the mosque today at 5am?

276
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Come for practice now or we will get late

277
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Yesterday! i slept in midnight so that's why i couldn't woke up

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So how much time will take it now?
-Usually it takes 30 mins but it can be done in 10 mins too

279
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000

00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000

Now, neither your advices nor mom's advices

287
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I will do my own job,i will sell newspapers like gurinder

288

I will buy cricket kit by my own salary
-You will see

289
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Good! You got some sense too

290
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So, it means that not under-16 but till under-19, you will easily buy a new cricket kit
-So, what should i need to do to this cricket bat?

291
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Sister! Give me my cricket bat

292
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This isn't funny

293
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What if i got mad?

294
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000

Bro! Stop kidding 
-Bro! Really, our name is not in this list

00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000

304
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000

Everyone is suggesting different players
-Sir! Why do you just see him?

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And where did you get this cricket kitbag?

351
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
He got it from his school

352
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Go Veeru
-By selling this ring

353
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Ring----
-I gave my ring to someone 

354
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:27,300
Bani! Don't lie

355
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Jeevan Saraj told me everything

356
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
You sell it? You should've sell everything to complete his passion

357
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
That accessories was from my side
-Don't start it again, mom

358
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Drama?
-Do hell with your tongue

359
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
The boy has ignored you
-They only found your 12 combinations in horoscope

360
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Only 12 combinations?
They wanted to collect accessories in place of combinations

361
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
That's the main reason why you sold your ring, huh?

362
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I've been collecting single penny to make accessories for you

363
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
And you for this idiot---
Mom!

364
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Hey! What are you doing?
-Cricket is the main reason of all these problems

365
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Stop it
-Stop it right now

366
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Stop me now

367
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
He's just a kid
-Why do you want to turn him as head of this family?

368
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Everything will get normal
-Mom

369
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
You stole cash from my pocket?
-No

370
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
You stole cash from my pocket?
-No

371
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Stole cash from my own pocket?
-No

372
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Dad! I will never try it again
-You fool, stupid

373
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Dad! Stop now
-Don't hit me with that cricket bat

374
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I will kill you

375
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Please dad, stop it
-Don't do this

376
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Gurinder! Did your parent's also hit you?

377
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
No Bro

378
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I want to find any job

379
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Hahahahaha
-Did your mom hit you on your head?

380
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Shut up! I'm in this condition because of you

381
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I can't even sit anywhere

382
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
If you ever dare to stop your cricket bat at my house----

383
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Dad! Hit me with that cricket bat
-And turned my ass into monkey's ass

384
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Do you want to see it? see
-No, i don't want to see it

385
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Bro! Don't scare me

386
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
I think that i would've killed that coach

387
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Yes Bro, he didn't even selected us after saying yes 

388
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Fools! Didn't you guys saw those recommendation letters of that coach?
-Those kids, kids from royal heritage think that they are champions

389
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You sell newspapers but you don't even read newspaper?

390
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
See this

391
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Lotus spoff school cricket challenge

392
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
Royal Heritage School is about to win consecutive 6 titles

393
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
This school cricket challenge is underway and many popular schools are participating in it

394
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm very glad to announce that our 4 players are in under-16 cricket team

395
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:45,000
This is the reason why people expectations are high for us in lotus spoff school cricket championship

396
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
But as you know that our previous coach Mr Sharma is leaving India and joining a UK University

397
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
All the best to him for his services

398
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
That's why the management gave me the responsibility for finding the coach

399
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,000
And i'm pleased to announce his name
-His name is hari sadu

400
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I have heard this name for the first time

401
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Hari Sadu?

402
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
If you would ask the same question to senior players or coaches then they already know him

403
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I known him from my University days
-He is best coach for our boys

404
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,000
But we have discussed Mr Oberoi name in the committe
-And our boys and their parent's are in favour of Mr Oberoi

405
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
We can't deny them

406
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Mr Chopra! My all eyes are on lotus spoff cricket championship

407
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
I completely agree with you, sir
-But

408
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Listen, Mr Chopra
-Managing committe gave me this responsibility

409
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
And i have made my decision

410
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Now, i expect all of you to corporate

411
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
But where is your hari sadu?

412
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
He will come here in a few minutes

413
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Last ball and they need only one run

414
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
If ball get's into gutter then it's out
-If ball hit's the walls then it's 2 runs

415
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
And if ball get's on the road then it's 4 runs

416
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And the uncle is ready to bowl

417
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:29,400
Come on, Uncle
-Hey uncle, why aren't you bowling

418
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Keep it up, uncle

419
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Only one ball left, uncle

420
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Come on! run, run, run
-Throw it here and it's out

421
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
It's out
-No, he was inside the batting crease

422
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
No, he wasn't inside the batting crease
-I knocked off the bricks(stumps) before he got into the batting crease

423
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You think i'm a fool
-Who is the umpire?

424
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Not out means not out

425
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Hey! You are a umpire or someone else

426
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Who is he?
-Your dad

427
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Hey! we lost the match because of you
-Hey, don't ask me, ask him

428
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Even indian cricket team can lose with your umpiring decisions

429
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Wow, great
-Now, give us the money, you like betting right?

430
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Why you are asking?
-Uncle, give us the money

431
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Hey! Give us the money
-Ok, as your wish

432
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Do it quickly
-Hey, give us whole money

433
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Atleast, give us whole money
-Get whole money from him, he's a cheater

434
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Hey! you made a condition

435
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
If you don't even know how to play it, then why do you play it?

436
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Hey! Don't say that again
-What?

437
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
See you next time

438
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Here comes the police

439
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
What sir?
-Is it finished or is it unfinished?

440
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Huh? why
-Everyone is waiting for you

441
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
And you're playing here with these kids
-Is this any standard?

442
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Standard?
-Bro, street cricket is called real cricket, whoever wins here get's the world cup

443
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
And listen
-Where it is street cricket or any other cricket, it is yet again called cricket

444
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Ok Sir, you lost this world cup
-Let's move on

445
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Ok! Let's go

446
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Your clothes are also not in a good condition

447
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
You should need to be a designer's assistent
-But you came here to understand cricket

448
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Sir, this school is very big

449
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Our work will get done

450
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Gentleman! Please welcome our new cricket coach
-Mr Hari Sadu

451
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Hi Hari
-Hey Gowswami(Gowsi)

452
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Hug me man, why you're getting formal?

453
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Hello!
-Mr Sadu, our school cricket team are 5 years consecutive champions

454
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
And getting the 6th cup would be a very honour for all of us

455
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
What do you think?
-Are you able to win with our boys?

456
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Wow! Gowswami(Gowsi), your reflexes are good

457
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,000
I thought that you're getting hot while thinking about cricket

458
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
Mr?
-Chopra

459
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Vice Principal

460
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Yes! Mr Vice Principal
-I teach players how to play cricket, instead of teaching them how to win or lose

461
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Hari is trying to say that with his vision, our cricket team will win

462
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
It'll be a new team
-A different team

463
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Rest ashort

464
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Anyways, thanks for being here
-Thank you so much

465
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Thank you

466
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Look Hari, if i wanted then i would've choose any formal test cricketer as a coach

467
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Nobody can deny me

468
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
But i know that our cricketers need a coach of desi style

469
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
They think that like the past 5 years
-They will win the cricket championship again

470
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,000
You have to fix their over-confidence and casual attitude

471
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
But you have to handle them with care

472
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
These cricketers were expecting Hari Oberoi as their coach

473
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
But i have choosen you for this job

474
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
You Know?

475
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Is it a request,threat or blackmail?

476
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Look Hari, be serious
-There is a possibility that the cricketers might not like you

477
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
You Know?
-Gowsi! You're getting older before time

478
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Don't think too much

479
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Everything will be fine

480
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
One more thing
-Hey bro, you're talking too much

481
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You have explained me everything and got it

482
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Now, come on 
-Introduce me to the cricketers

483
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Come on,let's go

484
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Mr Oberoi! I'm Chopra from Royal Heritage School

485
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm so sorry, i tried my best
-But the principal appointed a new coach

486
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
His name is hari sadu

487
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't know
-But i really sorry for you

488
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Hello

489
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Meet our team
- This Mr Siddharth Singhaniya, he is the captain of our team and our main bowler. He bowls very fast

490
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Like Shoaib Akhtar(Rawalpindi Express), he is called Royal Heritage Express

491
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Meet Mr Riki Malhotra, he is our opening batsman
-He plays like Australian Captain Ricky Ponting

492
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
This is Mr Rohan Kapoor, he is very aggressive batsman
-He likes to hit boundaries against bowlers just like Shahid Afridi

493
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:48,000
This is Mr Rohit Khanna, his batting style is just like Rahul Dravid(The Wall)

494
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Why?

495
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Mr Shiney Mehra, he is known as shane warne of our team
-His also the best bowler of this cricket championship

496
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
And------
-Gowsi! The rest of the other team is mine

497
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Who is Rahul Dravid, Shahid Afridi and Ricky Ponting of this team?
-Let me handle this matter

498
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm sure that you got other important works to do

499
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Oh! Yeah, ok

500
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I've heard lot of good things about you guys
-Now it's time to check it

501
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Come on, 10 mins on the ground

502
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Sir! Your friend hari sadu, i fell bad for you
-Don't go on his attitude, the thing is that these type of people are little crazy

503
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
And he doesn't have any cricket passion but he is a cricket cancer

504
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
My decision will get correct
-Let's hope for the best, sir

505
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Because of dearest friend(Mr Chopra) is looking for an opportunity
-And that opportunity can be hari sadu

506
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Sir! that one

507
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Good! They can play good cricket

508
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
Guys! It's time for a break

509
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Sir, this----

510
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Hey! come here, where are you all going?
-Sir, didn't said to take break now

511
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
We followed our captain
-Siddharth(Sid) said break, means it's break time

512
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Sir! Did you saw that?
-These are stupid kids

513
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Let them take break for now
-We'll see them tomorrow

514
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Hmmm
-Hey guys, did you heard this name(hari sadu)?

515
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
What a funny name, man
-Open it

516
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Imagine, he goes like this: ''Hi guys, i'm hari sadu"

517
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Such an idiot

518
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I think that this Principal Gowswami(Gowsi) got mad

519
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Siddharth! Do something, we can't play under him
-This can't happen, dude

520
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
He's a disgusting man
-Umbrella on my side

521
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Now this joker will train us

522
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It's sucks guys, it's really sucks

523
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Rohit! Were were you? 
-Don't ask guys

524
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,000
His asistent was asking that where are we going?
-Then

525
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Then what did you said?
-I cleared him, but i don't understand that what happened to Mr Harry Oberoi?

526
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Yeah! guys, wasn't he supposed to come

527
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Yeah! guys
-Guys, i think that Principal Gowswami and Harry Oberoi had a personal issue

528
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Maybe, it can be possible

529
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
It can be possible
-Anyways, let' see what he does

530
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
We will see him
-Bro, forget it

531
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
By the way, he would do whatever we want him to do
-Right guys? right

532
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I saw your game today

533
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
It's quite good

534
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Very good
-But it has one thing missing in it

535
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And that thing is discipline

536
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Discipline and Right Attitude
-Remember it that no cricketer is better than cricket

537
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Be humble
-From now on, you all will do 2 hours jogging, strectching and then net practice

538
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
What are you trying to say, sir?
-Aren't we suppose to play after doing 2 hours jogging and strectching

539
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Crap

540
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Ask the same thing to Ms Dhoni(Indian Wicket-Keeper)
-You will get to know that how he does wicket-keeping for 3 days long

541
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,000
For One-Day Internation(ODI), you need atleast 5 Days Stamina
-While for Test Cricket, you need atleast 10 Days Stamina

542
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
That's why physical exercises and jogging strectching are important

543
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And second thing, you will get place in the team for this month's performance and not for the performance of last 2 years

544
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,000
And the third thing, i will decide the batting as well as bowling order of you guys

545
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I will also decided on which time do you guys break or not

546
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Clear

547
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,000
This discipline is only good for lecture
-Have you ever adopted this thing?

548
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I do whatever i say, i don't like to give lecture to anyone

549
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Forget other things, it's time for a race

550
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Yeah! I saw your game
-Now, it's time for you to check whether i'm able to train you or not?

551
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Come on! How will do race with me?

552
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Come on 

553
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You

554
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Come on! Sid
-Show him Sid, come on

555
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Come on Sid, teach me a lesson 

556
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
On you marks, get side and go

557
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Come on Sid, go sid
-Beat him sid, come on sid

558
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Come on Sid, run fast sid
-That's the way, sid

559
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Come on sid, beat him

560
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Come on sid, come on

561
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Come on, come on
-Stop

562
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Come on, come on man
-Shit

563
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Too good sir, too good
-He runs very fast, go and bring me some water, ok sir

564
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
It's ok sid, we'll see him next time

565
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Come on, come on, come on

566
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Come on boys, run faster
-Faster

567
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Come on, come on

568
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Come on go, go, go

569
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
Come on

570
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Come on, good

571
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Hey, don't stop

572
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Come on, come on

573
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Come on, faster
-Come on, keep it up

574
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Hey! Don't stop

575
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Hey! go, go, go
-Come on

576
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Come on

577
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Come on, let go

578
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Hey! Don't relax
-Run

579
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Hey! It's the first day and you all are tired 
-You also have to do workout now

580
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Yeah! that's good
-Come on! get up now

581
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Very good, very good
-Come on

582
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Good, good
-Come on, that's good

583
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Now, high jump

584
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
That's good, i want energy
-Up

585
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Up, up, up

586
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Up, up
-Good, now come here

587
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Into the nets

588
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,000
Don't move your bat away from your body, rohan
-You will caught out

589
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Come on! one more

590
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Rohan! I said you to don't move your bat too away from your body
-Why aren't you hearing me?

591
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Come on sid, once more
-You know what mr sadu, i am known as Sachin Tendulkar of my team

592
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
And you're trying to teach me how to play cricket

593
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Hey! come here, what did you say?
-Sachin Tendulkar?

594
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,000
What do you know about him?
-Do you all know how much work does he put in his batting?

595
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
You know that?

596
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Who cares about that?
-All we know that he got a sexy ferrari

597
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,000
That's the mistake in you you, you can see his sexy ferrari
-But you can't see his hard work beyond him

598
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
So, you're saying that we aren't good players
-Mr sadu?

599
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Don't forget that, we are winning this inter school championship for last 5 years

600
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,000
Do you guys know 1983?
-English?

601
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Hey English Medium! it's 1983

602
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Did anyone of us know at that time that Kapil's Dev team will win the 1983 cricket world cup?

603
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Winning 1983 cricket world cup by beating Clive's Lloyd(West Indies) team

604
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Don't make excuses
-You will not remember that time when will you lose to any team

605
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Take it

606
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,000
It's a gift from you

607
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
What is this?

608
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Why?
-Not for cricket, but didn't you all need hooda's sir pant's to be a part of his team?

609
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Now the buffaloes are also asking
-What happened with the cricket passion of you guys?

610
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Really dude, now i can't able to do work in school and home

611
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Bro! This all happened because of that under-16 trails
-Shit

612
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Next time, we won't be a part of this thing
-Right bro

613
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,000
We all are not less than a cricket team
-They all to go hell, we will play our own game, right

614
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
That's good
-Ok then pick up the ball and get me out

615
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:43,200
Hey, i will bat first
-Who brought the pant's?

616
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Bro! if you will bat while wearing pant's then my concentration, line, length will get destroy

617
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Hey! Come in ground
-I will check your concentration

618
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Hey! Come on

619
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Come on! Billu, throw the ball
-I will show you something

620
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,000
Who is this junior team?
-Bro! don't worry, let me handle this

621
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Come on! throw one more
-I will show you again

622
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Come on! now you all can leave because we are about to play here
-So, now that you will play here till morning

623
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,000
And we, where will we go?

624
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Hey! little stumps, i will hit you and you will get killed
-Hey, don't force us

625
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,000
We will not tolerate this
-This is not your father's ground

626
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Hey! Short, you got a big tongue
-Alright, please let me go

627
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
I moved him out of this ground
-He was very clever

628
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Now, you all can play here

629
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Hey! What's this?
-He is peeing here

630
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Hey you, come and get him
-Veeru, come on and get him

631
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
Come on boys

632
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Good! good
-Ouch

633
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Hey! what happened?

634
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Sir! I have pain in my legs
-I can't run, sir

635
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Come on! it's cricket and these things happens in cricket
-Come on, go now

636
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Come on! Hurry up
-Sir, i need a break 

637
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Son! this is your fitness level so how will you play 50-overs(ODI) match?

638
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
No Breaks now
-Come on, hurry up

639
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
Do i have to give you invitation card?
-I have said that no breaks now

640
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Rohan! you're batting is still moving away from your body
-Play straight

641
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Ok! Sir, why don't you bat and i'll see?

642
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Ok! go now

643
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Come on sid, start bowling

644
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Sorry sir

645
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,000
It's a no ball in cricket, 1 extra run and 1 extra ball

646
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,000
And one, one run can change the match

647
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Not only speed, you also need control in your bowling

648
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Sir! Principal want's to meet you
-Tell him that i'm coming in a few minutes

649
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Take this, suresh

650
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Come on, time for practice

651
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Kids are not looking happy, hari

652
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I received some calls from their parent's
-Take care, they belong to rich families

653
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,000
That's what i'm teaching them that they are kids, not dad's

654
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
No! don't try it
-By this, we will lose them

655
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
As you know that i brought you here for a personal reason

656
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm accountable for you, i brought you here after so many comments
-Else, else you would choose a ex-test cricketer as coach

657
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:51,000
See, whenever someone tries to tell you something important then you get angry

658
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Because of your this attitude, you're here

659
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Or else, you would be---

660
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
When will you get changed?
-I am what i am gowsi

661
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And i don't need your advice

662
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I just want you to teach them as a friend

663
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I don't like to make friends while playing cricket

664
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
Kids would be waiting for you
-Let me go now

665
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Thanks for the tea

666
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
What happened? where did they all go?
-Sir! they are on break

667
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
So, what the hell were you doing here?

668
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Sir! I was----
-Ok! Let me handle this

669
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I think that i have to change them

670
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Sir! there they are

671
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Hey, come on
-Go to the ground right now

672
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Do you think i'm a fool?
-Suresh, move them out from that side

673
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Hey dude,relax chill 
-What happened?

674
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,000
The thing happened is that we have a proverb in tezpur
-Do you know the meaning of a proverb?

675
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Those Who Deserve To Be Assaulted By Blows From One's Feet

676
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I spoke too much
-What do you want me to do now?

677
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Hey! Collars down
-I said collars down

678
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Don't you understand

679
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I want all of you in ground in 2 mins
-Is that clear?

680
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Come on, out of here
-Hey, where are you staring at me?

681
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Come on, go go

682
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:41,000
And you people, if i ever saw these kids here again
-then i will hit the windows of every car, got it

683
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Get in, move

684
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Go on, go on

685
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
How the hell did he touch me, man?
-We can't handle him, man? this can't be possible

686
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000
We'll show him what we are

687
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
You can see the minutes of this meeting

688
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Only i gave my opinion in the meeting to replace hari sadu

689
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I talk to the Principal today
-But he said that mr sadu is his friend and---

690
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Sorry sir, but sadu is a scoundrel

691
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
We don't like him, sir
-We want you to bring mr oberoi here in replace of mr sadu

692
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,000
Please do it somehow
-Sorry boys, i'm helpless

693
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:36,000
In this case, only 2 people can do something
-One is Principal Gowswami and the other are you guys

694
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Sir! What we can do?
-You can do many things, siddharth

695
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
Don't forget that you are siddharth singhaniya
-Son of mr tej singhaniya

696
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Looks like you guys don't know your own importance
-You guys are not just student's, you own this school and only your choice will be approved

697
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Hey! you guys are champions, right?
-You deserve some respect, think?

698
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Come on, come on
-Up, up and up

699
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Come on, boys
-Go on

700
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Good! Excellent
-Keep going

701
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Come on! now move to left
-Come on, good

702
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
What happened?
-Sir, i have pain in my ankle
-No more excuses, come on 

703
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Come on, come on
-Is he crazy?

704
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:52,000
Come on, move
-Keep going, rikki

705
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Great job, sir
-You have set them

706
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,000
They are good but ignorant
-Just wait, they will be on line after few days

707
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Come on, sid

708
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Hey sid, what happened sid?

709
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Hey! go and get some water
-Sid, what happened. Hey, move here let me see

710
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Sid, what happened?
-You have done it, happy?

711
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I will slap you hard
-You do this, you are responsible for this

712
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Now you wait and watch
-What will happen to you now?

713
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
Hey! Why are you here?
-Why aren't you taking any action? what is this behaviour?

714
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,000
Silence! if you all will not hear me then i will not able to answer anyone of you

715
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Mr Gowswami! when siddharth(sid) told coach that he is not fit
-then why did he forced him?

716
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
If something would happen to siddharth(sid), how did mr sadu do that?

717
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Please explain this, look mr singhaniya
-Mr sadu, why did you forced him?

718
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
Siddharth(sid) didn't told me or my assistent(suresh) that he was sick

719
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
And he wasn't sick either

720
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:22,000
So, you think that mr singhaniya is lieing to all of us?
-Don't know, but i know that i'm telling the truth

721
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
You're lieing
-Who the hell are you to say anything to my son?

722
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Gentlemen! Please be serious
-Call Siddharth Singhaniya here

723
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So, i told both mr sadu and his assistent
-You can also ask the team, they are the witness to it

724
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And i don't lie, sir

725
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Sid, you may go now
-Thank you, sir

726
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:55,000
I don't understand his cricket, my son has a sore in finger

727
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
You know, how is rikki malhotra?
-He is richer

728
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Did the doctor advice him to play cricket?
-This is cricket, when you get pain then you can play good cricket

729
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,000
For your information, cricket is still played at big stadiums with hot weather

730
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
When he is able to play in this hall then bring him to me

731
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Enough! the guy who wasn't supposed to be the peon of this school 
-has turned into the coach of this school team

732
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Hey! do you know that you're talking infront of who?
-Get lost

733
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Hey! fingers down
-Who the hell are you to move me out of here?

734
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Mr Gowswami's signed has on my appointment letter
-Only mr gowswami has the power can move me out of here?

735
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Mr Gowswami, what are you waiting for?
-He said a very big to me and you're hearing it quitely

736
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:05,000
I think, mr sadu
-Who didn't give me any way, i mean you have to go now

737
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:14,000
You heard it, ok?
-I'm getting worried about you and your kids

738
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:22,000
They are good players but i want to make them the best
-And gowsi, you will get prosper

739
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I wish i would've said the same thing for your kids

740
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Anyway, good luck gentlemen

741
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Bro! You should've need to saw his face

742
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Atleast, they abide the joker

743
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Now, which team will you coach?
-For state championship, sir

744
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Be kind to the poor man
-Atleast, we need to give him 1 year training chance. We'll see you next year, sir

745
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
We'll wait for your Kapil Dev's world cup team

746
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
You want to challenge everyone, right?
We will be waiting for you

747
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:15,000
This isn't your mistake
-Remember, cricket is a very funny game

748
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
Hi

749
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
so, is your honeymoon is over?

750
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yes! and i also got divorced

751
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
How is Gowswami(Gowsi)?

752
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
What would happen to him?
-He is normal

753
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
His getting bald in terms of prosperity

754
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
You also did the same
-I did but i'm not good for them

755
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Ok! so now you will stay at home

756
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Because of this cricket camps, coaching
-We both turned into part-time couples

757
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You're lecture is over now
-Now tell me where is rustam?

758
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Where would he will go?
-He's watching tv, i forget today is One-Day International Match(ODI)

759
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Yes

760
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Come on, come on

761
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,000
First ball will be outswing, second ball will be inswing
-Rustam! what would be the third ball bowled by Irfan Pathan?

762
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Yorker! yes good

763
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
That's clean bowled, rustam
-Clean Bowled

764
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
My champion, give me a kiss

765
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Very good, mom do work and dad do fun
-Our Rustam

766
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
It's good that i came back
-So what were you thinking? was he upset?

767
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Forget this, he doesn't need us
-He has his own friends in playground

768
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Right?
-Friends, which friends?

769
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Nothing, there were some kids who were playing cricket in the park
-He saw them and now they are his friends

770
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
His alone now, if he would've had any brother or sister then--

771
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
You don't want to go to college
-Teachers shouldn't be late

772
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
If you want me to go then simply say it
-Oh, well i'm late

773
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I have to go, see you guys
-Take care

774
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Bye! Ok bro, now we both can see this cricket match easily
-The lecturer is gone now

775
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Sir! We have only four higher secondary schools left for coaching in tejpur

776
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
One is a girl's school so it got cut
-One is golden international school, the other is raj memorial school

777
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,000
And the last one is tejpur corporation school
Hey Suresh! do you want to take admission in school again?

778
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Sister in law! What did you said?
-Sir has decided to make an inter-school cricket team for this upcoming cricket championship

779
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Royal Heritage School should also need to be aware that they are in deep mess

780
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,000
You're partnership is good, you both are like student and teacher
-Ask your student, can we make a team in 15 days?

781
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Yeah! We have the chance for it
-If it doesn't happen this year then we'll try next year

782
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Ok! Rustam, right?
-We will make a team in 15 days, hmmm

783
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,000
it's difficult to make a team in 15 days, are you guys joking?
-We will get knock out of the cup in first round 

784
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
By the way, our school sports festival is coming too
-So student's will take part in it

785
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Look! Mr Sadu, our school is famous for acheiving good marks in board exams
-Cricket is good as a game but it's passion can be dangerous too, forgive us

786
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
If student's will get failed then their parent's will blame us
-Not you

787
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Sir! now only one school is left
-And that is Kushti(Wrestling) champion government school

788
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Don't worry, we'll make team of wrestler
-We'll go there tomorrow,ok

789
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:57,000
What? Tomorrow? i'm not free tomorrow
-Our maid(Radha) will be on leave tomorrow then who will take care of rustam?

790
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Hey! Don't get worried about him
-I'll take him with me

791
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
He will have fun and it's just for a few hours

792
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Ok

793
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Sonia(sona)! Hmmm
-Thank you

794
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:20,000
Seriously, you're like Rahul Dravid for me
-and also Shane Warne

795
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
If you weren't with me then---

796
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:30,000
God take care of all of this
-People say lot of things to their wives

797
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Things like star, moon
-Thank you

798
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Hey! yesterday was the night of 14th

799
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:54,000
So i fell love with you
-Some said that it's moon, i said that it's your face

800
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Is it good now?

801
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
It's better, now you go like Brett Lee and bring me a cup of tea

802
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
You will ever learn

803
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
Look! Mr sadu, i also had the passion of playing cricket at one time

804
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Then i realized that maybe this game is not made for us

805
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
It's ok that we all play cricket with plastic and tape balls for fun

806
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:29,000
But for a senior cricket cup, we need a lot of resources

807
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
And cities like us don't even have resources

808
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And by the way, you're talking about a very big cricket tournament

809
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
What are you saying,sir
-The things are now changed

810
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,000
People are playing cricket for entertainment in big cities
-But now the game has changed a lot

811
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,000
You can take our indian national cricket team as an example

812
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,000
9 out of 11 players come from small cities and villages
-While they don't have any resources or anything related to cricket

813
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,000
But they all have passion and conviction
-But, we don't our own school cricket team

814
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
I know that, sir
-But, there are 500 student's in your school

815
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,000
And i don't think that there can't be 11 players from your school who can't play cricket

816
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Alright then but let me clarify you one thing
-Our school will not give you a single penny

817
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
This is a government school of a small city

818
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,000
We even don't have any money to pay teacher's salary
-Sir, don't care about that

819
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
I'll take care of everything
-By the way, there are lots of people who help cricketers or can promote cricket

820
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Alright then, you can meet our school's sports incharge(Mr Hooda)
-Maybe he know any student's who have interest in cricket

821
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Thank you, sir
-You're welcome

822
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Sir! what happened?
-Looks like our work will get done, you go to the gate, i'm coming in 5 mins

823
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Ok! Sir
-Come on rustam, looks like our work will get done

834
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,000
You can make him as your cricket team's batsman

835
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
Hey Lapush! Come here

836
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
He is our younger wrestler

837
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,000
He's overweight but you can make him as your goal-keeper

838

Sir, it's wicket-keeper
-Ok! you can make him as your wicket-keeper, goal-keeper, sweeper, whatever you want

839
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Alright! so would you all want to play cricket

840
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Would you like to play cricket?
-Look sir, they are pro champions of wrestling

841
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Nobody in this district has the power to pick bat or ball

842
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Sorry Mr Huda for wasting your time

843
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Sir, now the wrestler also don't want to play
-Now, what will we do?

844
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
How we will make the team now?

845
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Rustam! hey rustam
-Hey rustam, stop 

846
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Hey, stop now
-Hello, how are you?

847
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Hey, wait a minute, who are you guys?
-Sir, we all are student's

848
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
Yeah! i can see that but how do you know rustam?
-Sir, he comes in park and he see us playing cricket daily

849
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,000
He is our best friend,right?
-Didn't your mom came today, rustam?

850
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Wait a minute, are they the kids which you see in park playing cricket?
-Yes, yeah

851
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Yes

852
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Hey rustam, didn't you bring your bat today?
-Come on, now see us your bat

853
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Now rustam, say goodbye to all of them
-Ok bye, bye rustam, say bye

854
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I had the same thing going on with me during school singing competition

855
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:24,000
My teacher used to say that: ''Man, you can't sing''
-I cried a lot

856
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Then my mom said me: ask yourself that do you want to be a singer?

857
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Then i realized that i'm not good in terms of singing

858
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:45,000
It's good that you all know that you can't play cricket

859
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Come on, let's go suresh

860
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Who says that we all can't play?

861
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Didn't you saw me on that cricket trials day?
-No batsman can't understand my spin bowling

862
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
And my fours,sixers can destroy the windows of streets and roofs

863
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:10,000
Sir, come and face my fast bowling
-If i can't prove myself then i'll change my name from shakeel to shakeela

864
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
If you ever had time then come
-I'll show you the art of batting, you're just saying

865
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
That's the spirit, do this thing to everyone
-It's a lesson for that coach who didn't select you in the trails

866
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:36,000
What do you think that Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh and Ms Dhoni didn't have to have to face these things?
-Didn't they lose their own hopes?

867
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:40,000
But they believe in their abilities
-They had trust, conviction and passion

868
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Do you even know when do you hear the best sound of this world?
-When the ball comes in front of the bat

869
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
The best sound in the world

870
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
If you want to hear this sound then come on the ground tomorrow

871
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
He looks like a cool man

872
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Listen, you have convinced the boys
-Do you believe in their game?

873
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I can trust rustam
-Just keep in mind that rustam gave me this team

874
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,000
Can i ask something?

875
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Will you answer it?

876
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Do you ever thought that rustam can also play cricket with other kids?

877
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Sorry, i can't complete your dream

878
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Sometimes i wonder that why don't we have other child?
-Please sonali

879
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Don't ever think about it

880
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And you know that i never thought about this

881
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
But i have thought it many times

882
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
I want everyone of you to hear me clearly

883
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:38,000
No cricket team can be made in 15 days

884
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
There are lot's of popular schools participating in this cup
-Who have strong teams

885
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,000
No cricket team like us has ever made it into the second round

886
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
We can't become state cricket champions in 15 days

887
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
And one last thing

888
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,000
And the thing is that we have to un-prove these things
-What we have to do?

889
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Un-prove it
-Very good

890
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I'm ready for it
-Are you guys?

891
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Very good
-Before the finals, we need to be at top spot, alright sir

892
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Now you all will shake hands with me 
-Or will you show me your game?

893
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,000
Come on, hurry up
-On your toes

894
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:56,000

-We all have decided to hire Mr Oberoi as our new cricket coach

895

-Open it

922
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000

01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,000

What the hell, sir?
-They all were watching it for 2 mins

938
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
What got happened if they saw them play cricket?

939
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:37,000
By the way, they all will do whatever we want from them

940
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,000
All you have to do is to get angry while hearing cricket

941
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:46,000
Sometimes i get vibes that you are also a cricket fan

942
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Why are you abusing me? 

943
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Cricket and me?
-I only know the name of 1 cricketer

944
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
He was Dhanraj Pilley
-The guy who was the captain, right

945
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Yes, i'm talking about him

946
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Else i don't anything about cricket
-And i'm your fully supporter

947
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I can't look at cricket

948
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Why the hell are you checking me?

949
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:20,000
Come on veeru, now do batting
-Sir, on these marbles?

950
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
How i will judge the ball?

951
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Hey, the bowler will not tell you about the deliveries
-which he will bowl to you

952
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:32,000
He will not say: "Mr Veeru, which bowl do you want me to bowl"
-Inswing, outswing or yorker?

953
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
How you will know about the bowl?

954
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Shakeel, take this ball and do bowling

955
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Come on, go now

956
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Now it's ok
-That's good

957
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Why the ball is moving away from your hands, mahipal?

958
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Don't know, sir
-Maybe the ball is slippery

959
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
One catch in cricket can change the match

960
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Now, remove your gloves
-You're having a grip problem

961
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Suresh! yes sir

962
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Take it, sir
-Catching ball with bricks?

963
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Do you remember Moin Khan?
-Moin Khan, who was the wicket-keeper of Pakistan

964
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Have you ever seen his gloves grip?
-Javed Miandad used to train him like this

965
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Hey Gurinder(Guri), come here

966
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Bro, after seeing your bowling movement
-The batsman will easily judge the length and line of the ball

967
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Then you will got hit by sixers and fours

968
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Have you seen Shane Warne on TV?
-Do you understand how does he do bowling, no?

969
01:15:56,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Bro, you need practice
-Do practice in streets, roofs and also do practice in nights

970
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Sir, electricity runs out all night in my home
-Didn't you know that?

971
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,000
Bro, you don't know
-How Harbhajan Singh used to do practice in Jhalander

972
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:14,000
When he doesn't have electricity
-Stop making excuses and go do practice, ok

973
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Sir, our boys did very well in these 10 days

974
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Our bowling is weak, Suresh

975
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I wished we would've have 2-3 good bowlers

976
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Now how will we get these bowlers?

977
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:50,000
You will get bowlers, sir
-You will surely get them

978
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
You?
-Right

979
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
You don't need to go anywhere, sir

980
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
You will get bowlers from this school

981
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
But why are you being so nice?

982
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,000
As you know, sir
-That we all love cricket

983
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,000
But i have to hide this thing from Hooda sir

984
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
But believe me sir, we have 2 fast bowlers in our school wrestling team

985
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
One is Anni while the other is jayraj

986
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:17,000
I saw them play cricket
-They bowl really well

987
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
If you say then i can introduce you to them

988
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
God's promise, sir
-Just trust me

989
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:28,000
But i won't introduce you to them in school

990
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
In the evening, you can go with me and see them

991
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
And one more thing, sir
-Don't tell Sir Hooda about this

992
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Alright, we'll see
-We will go in the evening, ok

993
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Alright, sir
-Ok

994
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:47,000
Now we will have our own school's cricket team

995
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:52,000
It's been months since we all are in wrestling
-Now, it's time for fun

996
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Grace in the name of God

997
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Fool, so you have now become a pant's of a trouser

998
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Bro, i knew it from the beginning

999
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
No! Sir, please forgive me
-Don't try to run

1000
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I said don't try to run
-Sir, please sir

1001
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Sir, listen to me
-I want to talk to you about something

1002
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Let you teach you about cricket
-Don't run, fool

1003
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You want to play cricket, right?
-I will not forgive you

1004
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
112

1005
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,000
113

1006
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,000
114

1007
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Sir, please forgive me

1008
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,000
Sir, i will die
-Keep doing it, keep doing it

1009
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
You think you will make a cricket team in my own school

1010
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
And you will make it with the help of my wrestlers

1011
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
118

1012
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
119
-Sir

1013
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Can i say something?
-No

1014
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Just listen to me
-Please

1015
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Sir, i know that you don't want to hear it

1016
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Then i will say one thing

1017
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Are you the sports teacher of this school?
-That's right

1018
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:06,000
Look, the thing is that it's for the first time
-When any sports team is participating in a big tournament

1019
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
And these kids are practicing very well

1020
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:15,000
If these kids play well there
-then Hari Sadu will get famous

1021
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
He will get credit of everything

1022
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
And his pic will be in the newspapers too

1023
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:22,000
And you'll just sit around here for nothing

1024
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:28,000
Bro, what are you trying to say?
-I'm just saying you to be a part of this

1025
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Means you're saying the ox to give milk?

1026
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,000
No
-I'm saying you to mix water in milk

1027
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Listen, if this team win's then we'll get credit
-if this team loses then Hari Sadu will get rejected

1028
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:49,000
I'm saying that if the team loses then people will embrace Hari Sadu
-If the team wins then your pic will be in the newspapers

1029
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Sir, it's nice to meet you
-You were about to do Laxman's role but you become Hanumaan

1030
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Yeah, their hanumaan's guy got sick
-So, they gave me this role

1031
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Alright, forget it

1032
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Coach Hari Sadu is here to meet you
-You know him, right?

1033
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Yes, i saw him in school
-I have heard that you are a very good bowler

1034
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Bro, don't worry
-Don't get worried about Hooda sir, tell him about yourself

1035
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Hey, come on tell him

1036
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Yeah, i can bowl medium fast
-Good

1037
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Meet me in school tomorrow

1038
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,000
Where's the other one?

1039
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Yeah, where is Anni?

1040
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Don't laugh, tell us where is he?

1041
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
He's playing as a lady character

1042
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Can i come after completing this scene, sir?

1043
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Can i go now, sir?
-Ok

1044
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Anni is standing behind the set

1045
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Yes sir, i do bowling
-Spin or fast, sir medium fast

1046
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Do you practice daily

1047
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Not daily but i and jayraj used to practice 

1048
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
I need bowlers in my cricket team
-So, are you both willing to play for me?

1049
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:55,000
But what about Hooda sir?
-Don't worry about him, just tell us your wish

1050
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Hmm
-Alright sir

1051
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:20,000
Hey captain, how do you see your bowlers?
-Both are really good

1052
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,000
Hmm
-Welcome to Tejpur XI

1053
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Thank you, thank you
-Good, well done

1054
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Mr Oberoi, if these cricketers play in under-19 cricket team so what?

1055
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,000
They are not from our school

1056
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:37,000
And you're saying me to give them school's id card
-So that they can play for us

1057
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:40,000
That's cheating
-But Mr Oberoi is saying right

1058
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,000
If our school cricket team wins with the help of these cricketers
-Then what's the problem?

1059
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:51,000
Mr Gowswami, i don't like to go to managing committee for small matters

1060
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Why don't you call them?

1061
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Mr Patel, how are you?

1062
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Oh, that's good

1063
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
So, you're visa is ready, right?
-You're welcome, you're welcome

1064
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
And by the way, did you saw the umpire's list?

1065
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I see, ok
-Great, thank you

1066
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Congratulations Mr Gowswami, you are about to get us the 6th time cricket cup

1067
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Welcome to Lotus Spout School Cricket Championship

1068
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,000
First match of this championship is about to start

1069
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
I'm Ram Gopal Verma,i welcome you all

1070
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Today's first match is between Vidya Mandhir School
-Aka Adarsh Mandhir School and Bloomdev School

1071
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:23,000
Well done, sir
-All the things which you have done is not less than a miracle

1072
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:25,000
This is not a miracle, sir
-All this is because of these boys hard-work, that's all

1073
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:29,000
No! We only give book's knowledge to students

1074
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
You have told them how to live
-As well as how to fight in life

1075
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
You're just kidding, Mr Saxena

1076
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,000
No! Mr Sadu, i really mean it

1077
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Whatever things which you did for them---

1078
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
All grace in the name of God

1079
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Why all of you are shocked while seeing me here?

1080
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:50,000
I came here for this school

1081
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:54,000
And my opinion about cricket is the same as it was yesterday

1082
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:58,000
But i'm not fool

1083
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,000
What's your name?

1084
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
Hari Sadu
-Yes Sadu, sir

1085
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I know that this generation of kids like cricket
-Also, they want to play it

1086
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,000
So, they can play it
-I don't care about them

1087
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
If this school wrestling team can be wrestling champion

1088
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Then it can also become school cricket champions

1089
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Wow, that's the spirit

1090
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Mr Hooda, i don't have any arguments with you

1091
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:22,000
With your inclusion, our cricket team confidence also got boost

1092
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Sir, that's why i also come here with preparation

1093
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I'll hit you a slap, fool
-What are you doing?

1094
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Sir, i was removing wrestling quote---
-Go and give me this

1095
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Give it to me
-Sorry sir

1096
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Ok, everyone
-Is it right now?

1097
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Ok, everyone
-Is it right now?

1098
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
We got it, sir

1099
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Take care of rustam
-Don't worry about him

1100
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Our team is with him
-If i didn't had my college exams then i would've come with me

1101
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:10,000
No worries
-I will handle everything alone

1102
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
If we both would've go then they all would've get scared

1103
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,000
And i know you will will for sure
-Because you know how to win as well as how to lose

1104
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Right! you're getting emotional too early

1105
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Sir, can we go now?
-We're getting late

1106
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I have to go now
-Good luck

1107
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Bye

1108
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Grace to the name of God
-Grace to the name of God

1109
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Grace to the name of God
-Grace to the name of God

1110
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Sir, we will play here tomorrow, right?

1111
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
Yes boy, you're final match will be here tomorrow

1112
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,000
See this stadium
-How cool this stadium looks like, right?

1113
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:10,000
You guys played on mat-pitches in group stage matches
-Now, the final will be here on this pitch

1114
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Shakeel, take a look through this wicket
-Is it good, right?

1115
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Sir, this cricket pitch is very long

1116
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
When i will bowl on this pitch
-Then it won't reach these wickets, sir

1117
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Sir, the boundary line is very far here

1118
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
How will i or anyone throw from that end?

1119
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:26,000
This ground is oval
-How will i place the fielders?

1120
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,000
Hey, what do you mean by that?

1121
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
That is how a cricket stadium looks 

1122
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:32,000
I have saw it on TV
-But didn't ever thought that it could be very big

1123
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
We all can't play here

1124
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Bro, check this boundary line

1125
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Hey, are you all mad?

1126
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
Hey, everyone look here
-Gurinder(Guri), how much run-up do you take before bowling?

1127
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
22-yards, sir
-Can you measure it?

1128
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Sir, it's 22-yards
-I measure it, it's 22-yards

1129
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Is this correct, right?
-And you were saying that the ball won't reach here 

1130
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
Go to mid-wicket position
-And through the ball to the stumps, ok?

1131
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Sir, it's very far, it won't reach here
-Don't make excuses, do it now

1132
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Mahipal(Mahi), go there and try to catch the ball
-Ok, sir
1232
01:32,12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Hey, it's 22-yards
-Yeah, man

1133
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Sir, the ball reached here

1134
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
And you, you're the captain of this team

1135
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
When Shakeel will be bowling
-Then which field placement will you use?

1136
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Sir! 2 slips fielder, one fielder on gully position
- single fielders on both cover and extra cover position

1137
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
One fielder on fine leg, one fielder on mid-wicket position
-And one fielder on mid-off position

1138
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
So, why can't you use this fielding strategy on this ground?

1139
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:50,000
It'll get done, sir
-We'll cover these ground with fielders

1140
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Good! Remember one thing

1141
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,000
Many people will come and sit in this ground 
-To see this cricket match

1142
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
This stadium will be fully filled with people

1143
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
But you all don't need to see this

1144
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Forget everyone who will sit here or not by tomorrow

1145
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:07,000
You all are here to play good cricket

1146
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:11,000
You want to show that this ground belongs to all of you guys

1147
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
And you all own this ground

1148
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:19,000
But you will own this place
-When you will tell the world tomorrow that

1149
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
how to play cricket

1150
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
And what it's passion about

1151
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Is that clear?
-Yes, sir

1152
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:29,000
I can't here it
-Yes, sir

1153
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
What do you mean to say?

1154
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I didn't get it

1155
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Well, at the end of the day Mr Gupta
-It's just a kid's championship

1156
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Who cares whether who wins or lose?

1157
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:54,000
But if you'll corporate with us
-Then your boys practice will get good and our reputation will get going

1158
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
What do you think?

1159
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Umpiring will be fair, Mr Oberoi

1160
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,000
Oh, sure
-Sure

1161
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
But you know what Mr Gupta
-Next week, This board is calling for a meeting

1162
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,000
It's for the umpire panels of National Trophy's Cup

1163
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:13,000
And i'm also a board member
-And we all discussed on your name for that spot

1164
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:17,000
And you also understand that

1165
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Once we get that National Trophy Cup then International Level of Cricket is not far

1166
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
All i'm asking for some little corporation from your side

1167
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
What do you need from me?

1168
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Just take care of the No balls and the LBW's
-From both sides

1169
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Hey guys, yes sir
-All good, yes sir

Yes sir, come on
-Let's go, let's go now

1173
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:00,000
I want all of you to sleep atleast 8 hours in night
-And no late night sleeping, ok

1174
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Suresh
-And this my boys is the field of battle

1175
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:06,000

-Again you're time is in the finals

1179
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
But it's not a surprise for us

1180
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Our boys have been winning this championship for past 5 years
-And i'm sure that they will win it too

1181
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,000
But it looks like a tough competition this time

1182
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
Alright
-Those Tejpur boys---

1183
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:36,000
Mr Pandey, the standard of this championship is getting low now

1184
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:41,000
These days, any team comes from any place to play cricket

1185
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
It's good because through this match
-Their confusion will get away that they can also play cricket

1186
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,000
So are your boys prepared?

1187
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Prepared?
-My boys are prepared for the party tomorrow night, Mr Pandey

1188
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Our boys are rising with confidence as you can see

1189
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:02,000
Champagne bottle is ready and we all are waiting for tomorrow's win

1190
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
And both of you are gorgeouly invited

1191
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:14,000
But Mr Oberoi, the people who have seen Tejpur boys playing cricket
-Says that we can't win against them easily and we can't stop them

1192
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Tomorrow we will stop them

1193
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Mr Sadu, i'm Harry Oberoi

1194
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
All the best 

1195
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Whom will you stop? Mr Oberoi

1196
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Did you able to stop Sachin Tendulkar?

1197
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Sachin Tendulkar had only one t-shirt
-He used to wash that t-shirt and then go for practice

1198
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
He, he is our Sachin Tendulkar

1199
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Can you stop him?

1200
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
What will you do when Ms Dhoni will come from the steets of Jharkhand?

1201
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Can you stop Harbhajan Singh from the farms of Punjab as well as RP Singh from raipa riley
-And Mohammad Kaif from Allahabad?

1202
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Can you stop Virender Sehwag from the village of najudath?

1203
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Speak now

1204
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:02,000
You will stop Irfan Pathan, right?
-Who recited Holy Quran and got passion for cricket

1205
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:10,000
No! Mr Oberoi, places like Tejpur are the future of Indian Cricket

1206
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
You can stop them, right?

1207
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
And if you have the strength then stop them from tomorrow

1208
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
I find your confidence really interesting, Mr Sadu?

1209
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
We'll see about this tomorrow, ok?

1210
01:37:32,000 --> 01:39:09,340

-Sure

1211
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000

And in a few minutes, batsman Rohit Khanna and Rohan Kapoor
-Will open the batting for Royal Heritage School

1215
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
I don't care if you win or lose

1216
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:08,000
If you play good and then lose then i won't feel bad

1217
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Play like people remember you guys for 10 years

1218

01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
That's it

1221
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Attack them from the beginning

1222
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
Cricket is a mind game

1223
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Demoralize them
-All the information which i gave you about these Tejpur boys

1224
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Do you all remember that?
-Yes sir, use it to demoralize them

1225
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,000
Ok, yes sir
-That's all you should remember

1226
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:50,000
But sir, why do we get personal about them?

1227
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:55,000
Sir, we all will play well and we will defeat them
-They all got the same opportunity

1228
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Siddharth! teams not win matches in cricket because of good strategy

As Royal Heritage School is known for it's bowling

1235
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Around this cup, their opening batmans have played really well

1236
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Now, it's time to check
-That how what strategy does the bowlers of Tejpur school adopt?

1237
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,000
Wow! yes

Sir, how will we win?
-They are hitting boundaries everywhere

1245
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,000
It's cricket, Mr Hooda
-Who knows what can happen? ok

1246
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Well bowled, Shakeel
-Sir, what the hell?

01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Now, go away from here

1250
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,000
Ok! no problems, Shakeel

1251
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Yes, keep it up, man
-That's the way

1252
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000

Fool! 

1257
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Sir said the right thing
-Anything can happen in cricket

1258
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
I agree with that
-But now 10 batsmans are left

1259
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Now, it must like wrestling

1260
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Wrestler is down and the match gets end

1261
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000

Their morale is high right now
-I want you to break that

1275
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Be aggressive
-No one will get to know about your sportsman spirit

1276
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:25,000
The is cricket right
-People only remember the winner

1277

So go for it
-Right Sir

01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
You can do it
-Come on Siddharth(Sid), come on

1279
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Siddharth(Sid), this sardar looks very dangerous in bowling

1280
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:40,000
We have to do something about him

1281
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:43,000
You will do something
-Or do you want me to do something to him?

1282
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Now, i will do everything Ranjan
-You just wait and watch

1283
01:43:47,000 --> 01:45:30,490
Come on

1284
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Captain Siddharth Singhaniya now has the responsiblity to anchor this innings

1285
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Now, we will see what he does in this match

1286
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Go, go now
-He will be out now

1287
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:03,000

Sir, he has hit our player with anger
-Sir, why you aren't doing anything? 

1291
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Wait a minute, it was an accident

1292
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Anything can happen in cricket
-Sir, you think this is an accident?

1293
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Sir, you are in favour of opponent's team
-You're not giving any LBW decision right and no chance of catch out

1294
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Hello, if you will speak more then
-I will declare this match in favour of them

Got it?
-Now, come on and go

1296
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:53,000
Mahipal(Mahi)! Listen
-These batsmans are mad, they are playing only on off-side position

1297
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Why you aren't getting me?
-One fielder on that spot and one on that one

1298
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:57,000
Ok

1299
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,000
How's that?

-Ok, no problem, come on

1301
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Both the batsmans of Royal Heritage have took advantage of not having Gurinder Singh

1302
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:35,000
Both these batsmans are putting a good score here

1303
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
And Captain Singhaniya is looking in a good mood

1304
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Shakeel! what do we do now?

1305
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:45,000
We have to stop these batsmans
-I say that you should bowl some bouncer to them

1306
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Break their heads, if they will bat then they will hurt us

1307
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Do you remember what coach said to us?
-We have to play with calmness and not with anger

1308
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,000
But you're saying right, bro
-If Gurinder(Guri) was here right now then they all would be gone

1309
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,000
Why did you got scared?
-You should've used some wrestling skills over there

1310
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:05,000
Now, come and take rest
-Mr Hooda, He has to go on the field now

1311
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
What are you saying, sir
-His jaws got broken

1312
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Sir, looks like he doesn't have any chance left to play now
-He has to retired hurt now

1313
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Gurinder(Guri), do you want to get retired hurt?

1314
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,000
If you want to be retired hurt then sit here
-Or do what Anil Kumble did against West Indies

1315
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Gurinder(Guri)! Can i bowl right now, captain?
-We all were waiting for you, bro

1316
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Come and show them what you are
-Now, come on 

1317
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Come on
-Come on, my bro

1318
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Oh! catch it

1319
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
How's that?
-Yes

1320
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
Yes, yeah
-Come and hit six,four on my bowling

1321
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Well played, bro

1322
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Come on Gurinder(Guri)
-Come on

1323
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:37,000
And in 30 overs
-Royal Heritage School have made 190 runs on the scoreboard

1324
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:42,000
And Tejpur Aka Vidya Mandhir School need 191 runs in 30 overs.

1325
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,000
Now it's time to see that how Tejpur School 
-play against the bowling of Royal Heritage School

1326
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
Boys! listen to me very carefully now

1327
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,000
The target is very big, their bowling is good too

1328
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,000
And umpires are on their side
-So no fighting

1329
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Ok, just hit the ball
-And try not to lose wickets 

1330
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:00,000
Keep rotating strike, Veeru
-Ok? yes sir

1331
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:06,000
Keep taking singles on every ball
-They will comment on you and try to demoralize you

1332
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,000
But you don't need to hear them
-Only the sound of bat is what you should think

1333
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:13,000
That's it, ok?

1334
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Ok, come on 
-Come on, Veeru, come on

1335
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
Come on Veeru, come on

Umpire! leg-stump please

Come on boys, come on
-Come on boys, come on Siddharth(Sid)

1340
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:41,000
It's a charity match, dude
-We all will give you the prize money for your mind cure

1341
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:44,000
So you can know where you belong

1342
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Go and play wooden-stick cricket

1343
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:54,000
Do wrestling, do whatever is your respect
Got it?

1344

Oh! yes
-Shiney, come on

1355
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:31,000
They are trying to play defensive, Siddharth(Sid)
-We have to bowl those delieveries which we bowled to their coach, right

1356
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:35,000

1363
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
Wait! our player will hit a six or a four on this ball

1364
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:14,000
Sir, what's this?

1365
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Come on, Veeru
-Stand up

1366
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,000
Yes! yeah
-What a shot

01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:45,000
Come on
-Shit

1368
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,000
While seeing this pitch
-Now, Shiney Mehra(Shane Warne Of Royal Heritage School) has come to bowl

1369
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Oh! well bowled, Shiney
-Well bowled

1370
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:12,000
What happened bro, didn't you judge the ball?
-You want to make runs, hmm

01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Here, i will bowl you like a kid

1372
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:16,000
Hit it

1373
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Come on, go now

1374
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
How's that? How's that?
-How's that?

1375
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Yeah! 

1376
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:37,000
Yeah! Hahahahaha

1377
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
How's that? How's that?
-Yeah!

1378
01:53:59,000 --> 03:47:02,000
That's it, boys
-Yes! Mohit, are you seeing how our boys are playing right now?

1379
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Are you watching them?

1380
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Catch it! Catch it

1381
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:12,000
Yes! yeah

1382
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:18,000
In this match, looks like Vidya Mandhir School will lose now

1383
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:21,000
But their captain Virpal(Veeru) is still on the crease

1384
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:26,000
But their 6 batsman are sitting out of the pavillion

1385
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Be calm, Mahipal(Mahi)
-We don't have more batsman who can bat after you

1386
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Rotate the strike
-And control your temper there, got it

1387
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Come on, Mahipal(Mahi)
-Go now, come on Mahipal(Mahi)

1388
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Mahi, Mahi, Mahi
-Mahi, Mahi

1389
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Rohit to your right side, to your right
-Ranjan to your left side

1390
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
Right side, to your right
-Come on boys, come on

1391
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:03,000
Bro, Bowl him on the line
-Hey, what are you hitting?

1392
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Dear Rohan!Oh

1393
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Sir, he's trying to be a hero
-We will lose the match because of him, i'm telling you

1394
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,000
Hey! play easily

1395
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
He's mad

1396
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,000
After the arrival of Mahipal(Mahi), this game is getting close

1397
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:39,000
Hey! throw it here
-Looks like Royal Heritage School bowler's strategy is not working here

1398
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Oh! that's a six

1399
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Mahi, Mahi, Mahi
-Very Good, Mahipal(Mahi)

1401
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Mahi, Mahi, Mahi, Mahi

1402
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Hey! very good
-Hey rustam

Yes! hit boundaries on every ball bowled by them

1404
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,000
Come on, come on

1405
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Hey, try to play sensibly
-Veeru, it's not time to understand their bowling

1406
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
We just have to hit every ball bowled by them
-Try to understand what i'm saying, man

1407
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:21,000
If we will not play our natural game then we'll lose this match
-Alright, go now

1408
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
How's that? How's that?
-Yeah, yes

1409
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:48,000
Come on, come on
-Wooh! well bowled Shiney

1410
01:55:48,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Oh Shit! Sir, i told you earlier

Now you're a hero, hmm
-Are you ok now, we've lost this lost

1412
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
We all used to teach you
-Were we all fools?

1413
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Hmm

1414
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Hey! nothing will happen if you'll cry
-Shut up, Suresh

1415
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Sir, move back
-We still have 3 wickets left

1416
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:32,000
You all can see veeru there
-Isn't he standing alone on the crease?

1417
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,000
Yes sir
-Isn't he still there on the crease? yes sir

1418
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Yes sir, good
Gurinder(Guri), it's your turn now

Come on, let's break them
-Look at that joker, man

1423
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:59,000
Hey, your head is injured
-Now you want to break your legs

1424
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
Please guys
-Do you all remember what coach sadu said to us?

He will get out
-And listen, be careful

1432
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
What the hell are you doing?
-What the hell?

1433
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:45,000
Hey

1434
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Yes Mr Chopra, How are you?

Good, good

01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Come on, Siddharth(Sid), come on
-Sir, He is trying to change the ball, sir

1443
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Sir, he is doing ball tampering
-Do your job, kid

1444
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
I know what is happening out here

1445
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
What happened?
-Are you scared?

1446
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:44,000
Where is the Sachin Tendulkar which was inside you?

1447
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Come on, now i will see how you bat

1448
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
Come on, Come on Siddharth(Sid)

Veeru! veeru
-Come here

1451
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:24,000
What are you trying to do?
-Why are you playing loose shots?

1452
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Only 2 wickets left
-And we need more than 50 runs

1453
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:28,000
Sir, Siddharth(Sid) is trying to abuse me

1454
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:30,000
So?

1455
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Sir, he is abusing me
-So?

1456
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
Do you know in 2003, Shoaib Akhtar was abusing Virender Sehwag in Pakistan?

1457
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,000
Do you know what Virender Sehwag said to Shoaib Akhtar in reply?

1458
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Hmm! Ok, go now

1459
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
Oh! well bowled, well bowled

1460
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
Well bowled, well bowled man
-Well bowled

1461
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:01,000
What happened, dude?
-Are you scared?

1462
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Try to hit six/four
-I'm bowling you right now

1463
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
Bro, are you bowling me or are you begging me?
-When my heart says then i will hit the ball, now go and ball

1464
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Go and bowl, dude
-Bro, now you'll see, just wait and see

1465
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Come on, Siddharth(Sid)
-Get him man, get him

1466
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:18,000
To your right side position, to your right side position
-Here

1467
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:20,000
Yeah, yeah
-Right here, come on Siddharth(Sid), come on

1468
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:32,000
What a shot, bro
-Yes, that's the spirit

1469
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Come and go now

1470
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Come on, come on
-Run Veeru

1471
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:44,000
Come on
-Take double run on this ball

1472
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
Come on, run, run
-Throw it, fast

1473
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
Come on, fast
-Throw it, man

1474
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,000
For winning this match, Adarsh Vidya Mandhir School needs runs
-Well as they have to save their wickets

1475
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:56,000
Looks like, captain Veer pal is playing with that strategy

1476
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Yeah, yes
-HAHAHA

1477
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:12,000
Shit, try to catch it
-Ranjan, try to catch it

1478
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Because of skipper Veer pal
-This match is now getting interesting

1479
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Now, Tejpur school team needs 5 runs from 6 balls

1480
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:32,000
But the problem is that their bowler is on strike
-And we have to see if he can take a single or so on this ball

1481
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,000
This match is getting more interesting
-Siddharth Singhaniya is about to bowl the first ball of this last over

1482
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
And Shakeel Khan will face him now

1483
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Oh! well bowled Sid
-Well bowled

1484
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:47,000
Well bowled, Sid
-Well bowled, come on, come on

1485
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,000
Oh! well bowled, Sid
-Well bowled, come on

1486
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Shakeel, take one run man
-Give me strike man, Baani sister's promise we will win this match

1487
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:05,000
Just take one run

1488
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,000
Come on, come on, come on

1489
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Wow! he can't play it
-He can't play it

1490
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Come on, yes
-Come on

1491
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
Oh! well bowled
-Well bowled, well bowled

1492
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Now it's very difficult to win from here
-If we had someone else then we would've won it

1493
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
But now it's---

1494
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Come on Sid, come on
-Let's do it man, come on

1495
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
Come on Sid, come on

1496
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Run, run, run. bro
-Run, run, run Shakeel

1497
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:02,000
Come on boys
-Throw the ball, come on

1498
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Come on, buck up
-Buck up

1499
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
Be careful, guys
-We got one more ball to bowl

1500
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:09,000
And---
-So, you think he can hit a boundary on this ball

1501
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,000
Listen to me, Sid
-Just go and bowl him a fast and furious bouncer

1502
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:19,000
Come on, Sid
-Come on, come on guys, come on

1503
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Come on, Sid
-Come on, Veeru

1504
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:35,000
Come on, Sid
-Come on

1505
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
Come on

1506
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,000
Come on, Sid

1507
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:18,000
Hey, yeah
-Veeru

1508
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Hey, Veeru
-Veeru, look at there

1509
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:28,000
Hey, look at there
-The ball has crossed the boundary, we have won it

1510
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:56,000
No match has been played ever like this in this championship

1511
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Adarsh Vidya Mandhir School defeated Royal Heritage School 
-To tell us that cricket can be played only with fair rules

1512
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Tejpur, Tejpur, Tejpur
-Tejpur, Tejpur, Tejpur

1513
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Ok! cheer up, guys
-Cricket is a very funny game

1514
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:44,000
This is a lesson for all of us

1515
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:47,000
But let us accept this defeat gracefully

1516
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:54,000
Go and congratulate them
-Yes, they played better than you guys

1517
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:57,000
And they are the champions of today

1518
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Come on and show them some sportsman spirit

1519
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Get up, up

1520
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
This is just an injury
-Just don't try to take pic of with this face

1521
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:12,000
Mr Sadu, Congratulations

1522
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
I will soon fix all the mistakes about you

1523
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:20,000
Don't fix teams, Mr Oberoi
-Build them

1524
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Congratulate, dude
-You all guys played really well

1525
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:31,000
I'm sorry about those things, man
-No bro

1526
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Thank you bro, because of that
-We have learned to avoid comments from opponents team but to play with them as friend

1527
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:47,000
What the hell is that?
-For that you need to take coaching from me

1528
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Hey Rustam, we won the match, rustam
-Your team won this match,hmm

1529
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:58,000

1530
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
Hey Rustam, we have won this match, rustam

1531
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:05,000

1533
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
Kiss it
-Yes, that's good

1534
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:17,000
Ok! it's time to take a picture
-Ok
