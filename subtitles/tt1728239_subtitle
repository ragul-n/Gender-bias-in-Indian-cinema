1
00:02:11,708 --> 00:02:15,735
A python never toiIs.

2
00:02:16,145 --> 00:02:20,081
Nor does a bird work.

3
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:24,176
Saint Manuka has said..

4
00:02:24,254 --> 00:02:28,486
..Lord Ram is everyone's benefactor.

5
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:51,646
Happiness is short Iived.

6
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,114
Life's fiIIed with turmoiI.

7
00:02:54,183 --> 00:02:56,413
The onIy Iucky person in this worId.

8
00:02:56,486 --> 00:02:58,716
Is the one that has
the power of green.

9
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:01,053
Here the party goes aII night Iong.

10
00:03:01,124 --> 00:03:03,183

00:03:40,396 --> 00:03:44,594
We wiII gesture you to come cIoser.

We wiII be Iost in each other.

21

Come to me home and
Iet things get on.

22

Tomorrow I wiII

23
00:03:52,809 --> 00:03:55,107
Sing baby, baby, sing this song.

24

ChiII out.

28
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:27,137
They say nothing's
free in this worId.

29
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:31,675
Take a Iook at us, we
are compIeteIy free.

30
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:41,187
They say nothing's
free in this worId.

31
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:45,721
Take a Iook at us, we
are compIeteIy free.

32
00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:49,223
Some became MA, BA
whiIe some became CA.

33
00:04:49,298 --> 00:04:51,732
We don't care whether
anyone Iives or dies.

34
00:04:51,801 --> 00:04:54,167
We are never wrong.

35
00:04:54,237 --> 00:04:56,205
Sing baby, baby, sing this song.

36
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,534
ChiII out.

37
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:00,098

ChiII out.

39
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,139
Stop!

40
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:33,267
Stop scoundreI.

41
00:05:33,342 --> 00:05:35,742
You dare spIash mud on us. RascaI.

42
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,473
We faiI to do
anything whiIe we are awake.

43
00:05:37,547 --> 00:05:38,639
Now that we are
having fun in our dreams..

44
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:40,409
..its making you jeaIous. RascaI.

45
00:05:40,483 --> 00:05:42,314
BIoody basket.

46
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:45,754
When wiII our dreams come true?

47
00:05:46,122 --> 00:05:48,113
For two years.. for
the past two years..

48
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,419
..we have been
standing near this board.

49
00:05:49,492 --> 00:05:52,620
But there is no trace
of a singIe accident

50
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:55,155
Boman.
- Yes.

51
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:58,594
Name is there but there's no trace.

52
00:05:59,602 --> 00:06:00,762
Excuse me, Adi.

53
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:03,335
How wiII we benefit
from a car accident?

54
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:05,169
You are asking after two years.

55
00:06:06,476 --> 00:06:09,639
This is the road where
that baId miIIionaire..

56
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:12,112
..toId us the secret of miIIions.

57
00:06:17,153 --> 00:06:18,620
Oh no!

58
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:23,757
'In St. Sebastian garden, Goa.. '

59
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:33,132
'.. under a big W.. a big W
there are 100 miIIion hidden.'

60
00:06:33,202 --> 00:06:34,635
'100 miIIion.'

61
00:06:37,373 --> 00:06:38,738
Mama wiII be proud of us.

62
00:06:38,808 --> 00:06:40,503
You made me donate aII the money.

63
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:41,770
'Come on, Adi, give the money.'

64
00:06:41,844 --> 00:06:43,539
'Why shouId I give the money?
Am I crazy? '

65
00:06:43,613 --> 00:06:46,173
'Give it, Adi, for mama's sake.'

66
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,578
Since then.. day and night
we have been keeping an eye..

67
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:56,181
..on cars passing-by.

68
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:57,724
Thinking now there
wiII be an accident.

69
00:06:58,094 --> 00:06:59,391
Now there wiII be an accident.

70
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:01,029
Not even a singIe car.

71
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:02,621
DisgracefuI.

72
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,390
Hey, brother.

73
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:08,400
Hey, brother. Bang
your car. Bang your car.

74
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:12,569
Hey, brother, at
Ieast you bang your car.

75
00:07:12,608 --> 00:07:14,701
Look, I am pIeading to you.

76
00:07:14,777 --> 00:07:17,075
At Ieast Iisten to me.

77
00:07:21,183 --> 00:07:22,445
Hey, brother..

78
00:07:22,618 --> 00:07:24,643
If you act so badIy peopIe
wiII sureIy spit on you.

79
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,687
Yes, no car wiII meet
with an accident here..

80
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:30,487
..because we are.. very unfortunate.

81
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,419
Now, there's just one way Ieft.
- What way?

82
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:38,732
The devious way.

83
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:45,568
Adi, what are we doing at this bar?

84
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,772
Oh, we are going to
cook omeIet and seII them.

85
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:55,749
No omeIet, we are going
to knockout peopIe. Roy.

86
00:07:55,818 --> 00:07:57,308
Of course!

87
00:08:08,664 --> 00:08:10,291
What?

88
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:18,467
Can I sit?

89
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,175
What are you going
to do with this egg?

90
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:35,349
Mister, if you can keep
this egg in your mouth..

91
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:40,088
..without breaking it,
I wiII give you 5000.

92
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:42,756
Tony, can keep an entire
chicken inside his mouth..

93
00:08:42,832 --> 00:08:44,322
..for 5000 so what's an egg.

94
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,234
Then.. keep this in your mouth.

95
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:50,329
Then give me the egg.

96
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:56,573
He has done an amazing thing.

97
00:08:58,314 --> 00:09:01,477
Forget about the egg and
chicken you have been fooIed, Tony.

98
00:09:05,187 --> 00:09:06,381
Why you..

99
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:09,617
HeIp! He's coming.

Okay, 1000 for you and 1000 for me.

Can you do it?

Fine, first you do it.

SwaIIow the egg. SwaIIow the egg.

00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,648
Break the egg.

00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:26,222
Break the egg.

138
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:30,461
Break the egg.

139
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,134
Break the egg. - Great.

140

Adi. Okay.

142
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:45,112
Adi.

143
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:50,745
Hit him, hit him, oh shit!

144
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,312
You can't hit me.

145
00:11:58,127 --> 00:11:59,594
Oh no.

146
00:12:12,308 --> 00:12:14,367
There they are. Beat them.

147
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,456
Enough. Enough.

148
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,565
No one ever beat us up so badIy.

149
00:12:41,637 --> 00:12:45,266
Adi, be thankfuI that at
Ieast they didn't rape us.

150
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:47,775
Our fate has raped us.

151
00:12:48,177 --> 00:12:49,804
If we had money..

152
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,779
..then we wouId've
had so many things.

153
00:12:51,847 --> 00:12:55,510
Yes, car, bungaIow,
bank baIance and ma..

154
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:57,710
Mother.

00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,879
Mercedes Benz.

00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:01,718
Yes, Mercedes.

157
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:03,319
Like the one Kabir's sitting in.

158
00:13:03,392 --> 00:13:05,360
Kabir.
- Kabir.

159
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,695
Kabir.
- Kabir.

160
00:13:09,765 --> 00:13:12,097
Where did that miserabIe
guy get so much money from?

161
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:15,235
Even he donated his money.

162
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:24,201
Run. Run, run, foIIow him!

163
00:13:47,269 --> 00:13:48,861
Such a big car.

164
00:13:49,271 --> 00:13:51,136
Such a big office.

165
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:54,799
How did Kabir become so rich?

166
00:13:54,877 --> 00:14:00,213
LoyaIty, honesty,
dedication and responsibiIity.

167
00:14:00,816 --> 00:14:06,379
Today Kabir Naik is rich
because of these four quaIities.

168
00:14:07,656 --> 00:14:11,285

quaIities in the four of you.

00:14:36,518 --> 00:14:40,352
Sir, how do we thank you?
- Just Iike you do.

180
00:14:41,623 --> 00:14:45,684
Look, if the four of
you keep working hard..

181
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:48,789
..then one day I wiII make
you partners in this company.

182
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:50,161
Partners.

183
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:51,392
Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

184
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,196

Okay. Okay. Come on.

186
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,262
It's okay.

187
00:15:01,643 --> 00:15:03,804
Instead of us four taIented peopIe..

188
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,377
..he's making these
four fooIs his partner.

189
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:09,383
It shouId have been
us in their pIace.

190
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,611
If we become the partners..

191
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:13,553
..then we wiII have car, bungaIow,
bank baIance.

192
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:16,557
But how wiII we become partners?

193
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:19,150
EmotionaI..
- Torture.

194
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:20,695
Yes, Iet's go.

195
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:21,821
Adi.

196
00:15:22,097 --> 00:15:24,759
Adi, no. Adi, no. Not this way, Adi.

197
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,290
Not this way.

198
00:15:35,577 --> 00:15:37,169
Napkin, sir. Napkin.

199
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:51,217
Troy.

200
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:54,685
Roy.

201
00:15:57,866 --> 00:16:00,630
Chaman.

202
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:02,636

Tandav.

204
00:16:04,373 --> 00:16:06,102
Yes, yes.

205
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:08,242
How are aII of you?

206
00:16:09,711 --> 00:16:12,509
What are you doing here?
- CIeaning the toiIets.

207
00:16:12,581 --> 00:16:14,549
What?
- Shocked, aren't you?

208
00:16:15,084 --> 00:16:17,552
That why
inteIIigent peopIe Iike us..

209
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:20,349
..are doing such a backward job.

210
00:16:20,756 --> 00:16:22,656
Have courage, Roy, have courage.

211
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:24,419
We wiII be successfuI.

212
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,825
There's hope in our hearts.

213
00:16:26,095 --> 00:16:27,562
No matter how much it stinks.

214
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:31,087
Cotton.. just Iike there's
cotton stashed in the piIIow..

215
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,100
..there are four things
stashed in us as weII.

216
00:16:33,168 --> 00:16:35,329
No, no, no, we are born with it.

217
00:16:35,404 --> 00:16:38,373
Like.. IoyaIty.
- Honesty.

218
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,840
Dedication.
- Deceit.

219
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:44,068
No, no, not deceit. ResponsibiIity.

220
00:16:44,113 --> 00:16:45,444
Just a minute.

221
00:16:45,514 --> 00:16:47,846
That's what I said.
- And we heard it.

222
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:51,518
Outside the window, covertIy.
- QuietIy.

223
00:16:52,154 --> 00:16:54,179
You eavesdropped
on my conversation..

224
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:55,518
..and now are
putting up a charade here.

225
00:16:55,591 --> 00:16:58,253
It's not a drama but
emotionaI torture.

226
00:16:58,327 --> 00:17:00,454
So that you can forget
about those four fooIs..

227
00:17:00,496 --> 00:17:03,192
..and make us your partners.

228
00:17:05,234 --> 00:17:06,599
Make your four partners.
- Yes.

229
00:17:06,668 --> 00:17:08,363
Good idea. - Thank you.

230
00:17:09,138 --> 00:17:13,302
If I even appoint
you watchmen here..

231
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,237
..it wiII be insuIting to them.

232
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:18,175
FooIs.

233
00:17:22,284 --> 00:17:25,481
He humiIiated us so badIy.

234
00:17:25,721 --> 00:17:27,154
Now no matter what happens..

235
00:17:27,222 --> 00:17:29,349
..but we wiII be your partners,
Kabir. - Yes.

236
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:32,518
Otherwise I am the
son of two fathers.

237
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:35,290
And I am the son of three father

238
00:17:35,364 --> 00:17:38,265
I am the son of four fathers.

239
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:41,564
I am the son of the entire India.

240
00:17:49,845 --> 00:17:51,437
There's no one in the office.

241
00:17:51,513 --> 00:17:53,674
Seems Iike Kabir caIIed us first.

242
00:17:53,749 --> 00:17:56,445
He ought to, after aII we are VIP's.

243
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:57,576
Very important person.

244
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:59,621
Now we'II have money,
position, power.

245
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:03,351
Now everyone wiII saIute
us and say.. - ScoundreIs!

246
00:18:03,692 --> 00:18:04,750
RascaIs.

247
00:18:05,494 --> 00:18:06,620
You wiII be punished.

248
00:18:06,695 --> 00:18:09,459
EquaIIy.
- Much more than that.

249
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,064
No.

250
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:17,535
You rascaIs, scoundreIs, fooI,
stupid, morons..

251
00:18:18,774 --> 00:18:20,071
I hadn't sIapped you.

252
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:24,602
You gave a 100 crores
estimate to Kabir sir on month end.

253
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:31,779
Yes. - But the profit
was just 99,99,99,000.

254
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:34,113
That means there was a
Ioss of 1000 rupees.

255
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:36,157
You.. you deserve one more sIap.

256
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:37,283
SIap.
- SIap.

257
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,055
Take them away.
- Okay, boss.

258
00:18:40,362 --> 00:18:42,091
Come on.
- Okay, okay.

259
00:18:44,066 --> 00:18:45,431
No, no, no.

260
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:49,068
Such severe torture
for just 1000 rupees.

261
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:56,135
Kabir sir has appointed
four new peopIe in your pIace.

262
00:18:56,211 --> 00:19:01,547
That means us.
- That's why you are fired.

263
00:19:01,617 --> 00:19:02,675
Fired!

264
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:05,379
And Kabir sir doesn't just say fire.

265
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:08,252
Then?
- He fires with his gun.

266
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:10,218
Give me the gun.

267
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,452
You are dirty.

268
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:14,085
Give me the gun! Gun!

269
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,554
Okay, boss.

270
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:19,767
Where is he taking it out from?

271
00:19:20,168 --> 00:19:21,226
Gun.

272
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,135
JaIIad.
- Yes, boss.

273
00:19:23,205 --> 00:19:25,230
CIose the door.
- Okay, boss.

274
00:19:25,307 --> 00:19:26,672
Don't kiII us.
- No.

275
00:19:26,742 --> 00:19:28,801
Don't shoot us.

276
00:19:38,687 --> 00:19:41,588
Murder. Murder.

277
00:19:47,296 --> 00:19:48,490
Run away.

278
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:52,226
You won't get anything
here except for death.

279
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:54,394
Run, Arjun, run!

280
00:19:55,537 --> 00:19:57,402
Run!

281
00:19:57,472 --> 00:19:59,440
Just a minute.

282
00:19:59,508 --> 00:20:00,600
Kabir sir.

283
00:20:00,676 --> 00:20:02,234
Look, he is here to kiII us.

284
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:04,472
Let us go, pIease.

285
00:20:04,546 --> 00:20:06,810
I won't Iet you go Iike this.

286
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,175
See, he wiII kiII us.

287
00:20:09,318 --> 00:20:12,116
I wiII kiII you?
- See, he is teIIing us.

288
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:14,451
''I wiII kiII you.''
- Shut up, you idiots.

289
00:20:14,523 --> 00:20:15,683
Otherwise I wiII fire you guys.

290
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,725
See he wiII fire at us.

291
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,767
So this is your doing.

292
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:30,304
Yes.
- ObviousIy.

293
00:20:30,372 --> 00:20:33,341
And untiI you keep
caIIing such idiots..

294
00:20:33,408 --> 00:20:35,774
..we wiII keep driving them away.

295
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:40,615
UntiI you don't
make us your partners.

296
00:20:40,682 --> 00:20:42,149
Understand.
- Partners.

297
00:20:42,217 --> 00:20:43,844
No.
- No. No vioIence.

298
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:45,711
Kabir. - PIease.

299
00:20:52,561 --> 00:20:53,789
Nice.

300
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,824
DarIing, what's going on?

301
00:20:55,897 --> 00:20:57,296
Is everything aIright?

302
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,124
Who is she?

303
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:03,495
She is our madam. Kabir sir's wife.

304
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:05,263
Wife?
- Yes.

305
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,773
She's his wife.

306
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:11,403
Sister-in-Iaw!
- Sister-in-Iaw!

307
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,108
Who.. who are they, Kabir?
- Kabir?

308
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:17,276
Not, Kabir. Ram, and you are Sita.

309
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:19,411
And we are Ram's younger brothers.

310
00:21:19,621 --> 00:21:21,316
So sweet.
- Thank you.

311
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,858
Just a minute. Ram onIy
had three younger brothers.

312
00:21:24,126 --> 00:21:25,388
ReaIIy?

313
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:27,451
That's okay.
Consider yourseIf Draupadi..

314
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:30,464
..and us, four pIus one,
five Pandavas.

315
00:21:33,702 --> 00:21:35,829
DarIing, you go on, I wiII join you.

316
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,196
Okay, darIing, bye.

317
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,796
Bye.
- Bye.

318
00:21:39,207 --> 00:21:41,801
The four of you managed
to barge inside my office.

319
00:21:41,877 --> 00:21:45,244
But if you try to
barge in my bungaIow..

320
00:21:45,447 --> 00:21:47,779
..then I wiII punch your face in.

321
00:21:49,518 --> 00:21:51,213
He's very short-tempered.

322
00:21:51,753 --> 00:21:56,781
Kabir, not just your bungaIow but
we wiII foIIow you even to heII.

323
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:00,120
Come on, foIIow him.

324
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,463
Enough is enough, Kabir.

325
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,166
There's a Iimit to everything.

326
00:22:12,307 --> 00:22:13,740
I don't want to
discuss this any more.

327
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:15,071
You understand.

328
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,738
Did you understand anything?
- No. I mean yes.

329
00:22:17,813 --> 00:22:22,307
But, I need some money..
- I said no means no, Kabir.

330
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,716
I give you money every month for
the monthIy expenses, isn't it?

331
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:25,845
Not a singIe penny more.

332
00:22:26,121 --> 00:22:29,784
If I couId get 500,000..
- You won't get five rupees.

333
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,387
DarIing, juice.

334
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:37,290
He turned out to be a
poor beggar just Iike us.

335
00:22:37,365 --> 00:22:38,457
Bye. Bye. - Bye.

336
00:22:38,533 --> 00:22:40,660
He's a beggar and she's poor.

337
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:43,135
He is Iiving off his wife.

338
00:22:53,448 --> 00:22:57,578
36.
- 24. - 36.

339
00:22:57,652 --> 00:22:59,176
Seven.

340
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,583
Shoe size. Shoe size.

341
00:23:02,691 --> 00:23:05,057
You are Iooking at her
shoe size, aren't you ashamed?

342
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:06,821
She is Iike our sister-in-Iaw.

343
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:08,820
What a sister-in-Iaw.

344
00:23:09,097 --> 00:23:10,155
Honey, Iisten to me.

345
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:11,665
Kabir, why don't you understand?

346
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:13,462
I don't want to have
this discussion any more.

347
00:23:13,535 --> 00:23:16,231
The discussion is over.

348
00:23:16,304 --> 00:23:18,204
I am going for a shower.

349
00:23:26,515 --> 00:23:28,483
HeIIo, GuIabo.
- GuIabo.

350
00:23:30,385 --> 00:23:33,513
My, sugar honey, sugar pie,
sugar doII, sugar bag.

351
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,818
That scoundreI is having an affair.

352
00:23:36,091 --> 00:23:37,422
That too so sweet.

353
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:41,155
He wiII die of diabetes.

354
00:23:41,229 --> 00:23:42,856
Idea. Listen.

355
00:23:49,471 --> 00:23:54,101
My wife must have been
born after 1000 foxes died.

356
00:23:54,409 --> 00:23:57,810
I am toIerating my wife for money.

357
00:23:57,879 --> 00:24:00,109
Otherwise I wouId
have Ieft her Iong back.

358
00:24:02,117 --> 00:24:03,812
I wiII adjust it in the accounts..

359
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:06,280
..and get your set by tomorrow.

360
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:09,414
And after that
Iights off, Jacuzzi on.

361
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:12,551
And have some fun in the Jacuzzi.

362
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:21,535
Kabir and guIabo wiII be together.

363
00:24:26,408 --> 00:24:27,807
Where is my other phone?

364
00:24:28,143 --> 00:24:29,667
Kabir.

365
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:36,546
Your mobiIe is right here.

366
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:38,547
You here.

367
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,281
How did aII of you come here?

368
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:44,652
And my mobiIe.
- And this mobiIe has an MMS cIip..

369
00:24:44,726 --> 00:24:49,754
..which has Kabir and
GuIabo's conversation.

370
00:24:50,231 --> 00:24:51,357
Yes.

371
00:24:52,233 --> 00:24:56,829
'My wife must have been
born after 1000 foxes died.'

372
00:24:57,305 --> 00:25:01,105
'I am toIerating my wife for money.'

373
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:08,807
'Kabir and guIabo
wiII be together '.

374
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:17,385
Adi, what if
sister-in-Iaw sees this cIip?

375
00:25:17,692 --> 00:25:23,153
He wiII be in troubIe.
- Shut up.

376
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:28,101
You are trying to bIackmaiI me.
- No.

377
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:30,364
We aren't trying we are doing it.

378
00:25:30,605 --> 00:25:32,334
Quiet!

379
00:25:33,341 --> 00:25:37,368
You think I wiII be scared of you.
- No.

380
00:25:37,445 --> 00:25:39,675
We are sure you wiII be scared.

381
00:25:41,716 --> 00:25:45,083
If you don't make us your partner..

382
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:53,151
..then we wiII send this MMS
cIip on sister-in-Iaw's mobiIe.

383
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:55,259
Kabir.

384
00:25:56,398 --> 00:25:58,457
The button wiII get pressed.

385
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:02,594
The button wiII get pressed.

386
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,441
Kabir.

387
00:26:12,514 --> 00:26:15,506
Why am I hiding? You hide.

388
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:20,177
Kabir, what have you sent?

389
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:27,319
What a superb joke you
have messaged me? - Joke?

390
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:30,831
Yes. Husbands and the
sun are so unfaithfuI.

391
00:26:31,099 --> 00:26:32,760
They come with
'Kiran' (Ray of Iight).

392
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:34,462
Stay with 'Roshini' (Iight).

393
00:26:34,536 --> 00:26:36,629
And Ieave with 'Sandhya' (evening).

394
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:40,300
This better be a joke, Kabir.
- Of course, darIing.

395
00:26:46,748 --> 00:26:48,648
If you don't make us your partner..

396
00:26:48,717 --> 00:26:53,416
..then we wiII make a joke out
of you in front of your wife.

397
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:56,651
Yes. - This isn't how
one becomes partners.

398
00:26:56,858 --> 00:27:01,022
One has to come to the office
and work to become partners.

399
00:27:01,229 --> 00:27:05,290
We wiII sureIy come to the
office but you wiII do the work.

400
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:08,164
And these goggIes are reaIIy
nice to watch you do the work.

401
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:09,669
Can I pIease have it?
Thank you very much.

402
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:12,536
Thank you. That Iooks cooI.

403
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:16,076
And to come to the office,
we need a car.

404
00:27:16,144 --> 00:27:18,374
The car keys. Because it
won't Iook nice if we waIk.

405
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:20,505
Yes, this is damn cooI.

406
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,779
Get Iost. - Auntie.

407
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:39,732
This isn't what I thought of you.

408
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:44,099
Ma'am, I aIways doubted sir.

409
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:45,799
What did I ever ask for?

410
00:27:46,174 --> 00:27:49,302
That there shouIdn't be
any dearth in my Iove.

411
00:27:49,511 --> 00:27:51,741
Instead I got a rascaI.

412
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:57,412
But I Iove this rascaI, darIing.

413
00:27:57,752 --> 00:27:59,845
I Iove you so much.

414
00:28:08,062 --> 00:28:11,520
My dear sister, do you
know who's responsibIe..

415
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,295
..in making me a con.
- Who, brother.

416
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:16,562
Bachchan sir.
- You mean, Big B.

417
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:18,196
Yeah!

418
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,470
When the poIice
department stopped my promotion..

419
00:28:21,543 --> 00:28:24,068
..and transferred me to YavatmaI.

420
00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:27,137
I had nothing to do there
except for watching teIevision.

421
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:29,542
And everyday at 9
o'cIock Bachchan sir..

422
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:31,380
..wouId come on teIevision and say..

423
00:28:31,452 --> 00:28:34,785
..''Kaun Banega Crorepati,
Kaun Banega Crorepati.''

424
00:28:35,156 --> 00:28:36,555
That's when I reaIized..

425
00:28:36,624 --> 00:28:41,391
..that its important to be a
con first to be a miIIionaire.

426
00:28:41,663 --> 00:28:44,496
And now with the two
of you supporting me..

427
00:28:44,732 --> 00:28:48,793
..we three cons wiII
make their pIight bad.

428
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:53,766
But, brother, the other four were
reaIIy perfect for our pIan as weII.

429
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:55,599
We managed to trap
them with difficuIty.

430
00:28:55,677 --> 00:28:58,646
They ran away because of these four.

431
00:28:58,713 --> 00:29:01,546
And then they came to me and said..

432
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:04,107
..pick us, pick us.

433
00:29:04,185 --> 00:29:05,652
So what couId I do?

434
00:29:06,187 --> 00:29:08,553
Last time I was going
to have a great time..

435
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:10,318
..with a huge amount of money.

436
00:29:10,391 --> 00:29:14,521
But my pIan was foiIed
because of these four fooIs.

437
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:17,459
But now.. no goof ups.

438
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:22,065
My dear sister, you keep
pIaying the roIe of my secretary.

439
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,604
And Kamini, you as my strict wife.

440
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:26,129
What is this nonsense, Kabir?

441
00:29:26,207 --> 00:29:27,697
These four aren't even quaIified.

442
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,800
Kamini, what was that?

443
00:29:30,078 --> 00:29:33,172
That's the first
diaIogue of our next scene.

444
00:29:33,414 --> 00:29:34,574
What is this nonsense, Kabir?

445
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:36,617
These four don't
even Iook quaIified.

446
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,276
That's exactIy what
I am saying, ma'am.

447
00:29:38,353 --> 00:29:42,380
Ask them.. who is most
quaIified amongst them?

448
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:47,789
Oh, so you are the
most quaIified one?

449
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:55,599
How educated are you?
- UntiI 10 o'cIock.

450
00:29:56,104 --> 00:29:57,332
UntiI 10 o'cIock?

451
00:29:57,405 --> 00:29:59,305
The schooI started at 9 o'cIock.

452
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,374
After an hour, the
principaI understood..

453
00:30:02,443 --> 00:30:04,707
..that I can't study anything.

454
00:30:06,314 --> 00:30:09,283
Did you hear?
- No, no. He is just joking.

455
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:11,841
We are quaIified. We
aIso have a degree.

456
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,386
What degree?
- MMS degree. Isn't it, Kabir?

457
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:19,449
TeII sister-in-Iaw.
- Yes, yes, MMS, isn't it?

458
00:30:19,627 --> 00:30:21,857
Ya, take me for a ride.
- What?

459
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:25,631
Is there any such degree?
- Ma'am.

460
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:27,323
Even if there is such a degree..

461
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:29,632
..then its useIess for our company.

462
00:30:29,704 --> 00:30:32,366
Look, Iook at their faces.

463
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,840
They Iook Iike crooks.

464
00:30:35,109 --> 00:30:36,599
Excuse me.
- Yes.

465
00:30:36,678 --> 00:30:38,578
Ma'am, fax.

466
00:30:41,449 --> 00:30:43,781
Ma'am, our property..

467
00:30:43,818 --> 00:30:45,843
..which was stuck in IegaI
matters for a Iong time..

468
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,212
..has been cIeared.

469
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:48,585
Now you are the
rightfuI owner, ma'am.

470
00:30:48,656 --> 00:30:50,283
Kiya, that's great news.

471
00:30:50,358 --> 00:30:51,757
Kabir, I am so happy.

472
00:30:51,826 --> 00:30:53,726
It was very important for
this Iand matter to be cIeared.

473
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:57,458
But why today? Why?

474
00:30:57,532 --> 00:31:00,626
It's aII because of these.. boys.

475
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,197
They are so Iucky.

476
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:07,764
You know something,
darIing. I Iove them to death.

477
00:31:08,209 --> 00:31:09,471
You are right, Kabir.

478
00:31:09,544 --> 00:31:12,274
Why today? Why now?

479
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:15,441
These four are Iucky rascaIs.
- RascaIs.

480
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:19,077
She is caIIing us rascaIs.
- She is aIso caIIing us Iucky.

481
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,314
I have decided.

482
00:31:20,388 --> 00:31:24,290
These four are now our
company's 20% partners.

483
00:31:27,161 --> 00:31:30,130
How much do I get then?
- Shut up, shut up.

484
00:31:30,198 --> 00:31:31,631
Ma'am, what are you saying?

485
00:31:31,666 --> 00:31:34,430
Kiya, arrange for a
veneration on the Iand.

486
00:31:34,502 --> 00:31:37,596
And invite these three speciaIIy.

487
00:31:37,672 --> 00:31:41,108
After aII they are
our Iucky mascots.

488
00:31:41,409 --> 00:31:43,343
Oye Iucky, oye Iucky

489
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:45,436
Oye Iucky,

490
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:50,678
Oye Iucky,

491
00:31:55,757 --> 00:31:58,282
Oye ediot oye

492
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,293
They are jacked now.

493
00:32:03,164 --> 00:32:05,064
Come, mister.

494
00:32:05,433 --> 00:32:06,764
The veneration is compIete.

495
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:10,167
Now hit the pIough on
this fieId and begin.

496
00:32:10,538 --> 00:32:13,507
DarIing, Iet these four do it.

497
00:32:13,574 --> 00:32:16,475
Why these four, ma'am?
Your husband shouId do it?

498
00:32:16,544 --> 00:32:21,311
We got this Iand as soon as
these four stepped in the office.

499
00:32:21,382 --> 00:32:23,441
So they shouId do
this auspicious deed.

500
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:25,179
You are right, dear.

501
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:26,777
Come here.

502
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:29,346
You are so sweet.

503
00:32:30,191 --> 00:32:33,558
Thank you. Hit it here,
here. - Okay.

504
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:35,289
One.. two..

505
00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:43,160
Wow, Adi.

506
00:32:43,237 --> 00:32:46,104
What is this?
- Super VasmoI 33 hair dye.

507
00:32:46,174 --> 00:32:49,473
Shut up, Iet me check.
- Okay.

508
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,639
Oh my, God. This is oiI.

509
00:32:55,683 --> 00:32:58,117
Oh my, God.
- Oh my, God. OiI. - OiI.

510
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:00,786
I can't beIieve this,
Kamini, crude oiI.

511
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:03,350
OiI! OiI!

512
00:33:03,424 --> 00:33:05,415
Oh my, God. Kiya, did you hear?

513
00:33:05,493 --> 00:33:07,188
Superb, ma'am, superb.

514
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:09,491
UntiI now, oiI was found
onIy in Arab countries.

515
00:33:09,564 --> 00:33:12,556
Sharjah, Dubai and now Mumbai.

516
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:15,830
Not just Mumbai, it's in
our own Iand, our Iand.

517
00:33:16,104 --> 00:33:19,232
Our Iand, our Iand, our Iand.

518
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:22,299
Our Iand, our Iand, our Iand.

519
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:41,124
Kabir, raise our percentage to 30%.

520
00:33:41,195 --> 00:33:42,787
Do it, do it.

00:34:43,591 --> 00:34:49,461
AaIu Bukhara, dig with a spade,

Dogs.

Then they wiII take

562
00:36:51,319 --> 00:36:53,651
And those rascaIs..

Cockroaches.

Move aside.

570
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:20,339

50%!

581
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:10,553
Even if you find an investor..

00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:15,034
..then how wiII you convince him?

583
00:38:16,804 --> 00:38:19,739

Hey, don't punch him.
He is our Kabir.

Hey you.

603
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:35,511
Amitabh Bachchan.

604
00:39:36,183 --> 00:39:38,651
By reIation I am your father.

605
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:41,153
And the name is..
- Forget it, speak ahead.

606
00:39:41,222 --> 00:39:46,057
Fix an appointment
with the investor.

607
00:39:49,597 --> 00:39:51,224
Goat. Goat, goat.

608
00:39:51,532 --> 00:39:53,796
Shahrukh Khan.

609
00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:57,099
Mandira. Mandira, no.

610
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:59,571
Obama, Obama.. no, no, no.

611
00:39:59,807 --> 00:40:05,302
My name is Manav, I am not..
not.. not an investor.

612
00:40:05,379 --> 00:40:07,313
Not, not.

613
00:40:07,848 --> 00:40:12,251
We want an investor.

614
00:40:15,856 --> 00:40:19,792
You want an investor,

615

He wiII say it in our ears.

Did you get your investor?

617
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:43,676
RascaI, you raised your hand on us.

618
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,642
Did you forget? Did
you forget GuIabo? MMS.

619
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:48,378
You are dead, I am
going to ruin you.

620
00:40:48,422 --> 00:40:51,516
Give the phone. Give the phone.
- Give the phone.

621
00:40:51,592 --> 00:40:55,585
I don't.. have the phone.
- What?

622
00:40:55,763 --> 00:41:00,132
Yes, Iast evening Kabir
asked for it and I gave him.

623
00:41:02,269 --> 00:41:05,534
He wanted to caII his mother.
He was missing her.

624
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:08,336
He was missing.. his mother..

625
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:10,343
You have ruined us.

626
00:41:10,411 --> 00:41:12,242
We have Iost the phone.
- We have Iost the investor.

627
00:41:12,313 --> 00:41:15,612
We have Iost the partnership.
- Adi, I am not so smart.

628
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:18,514
I wiII kiII him.

629
00:41:18,552 --> 00:41:20,349
That's enough.

630
00:41:20,421 --> 00:41:21,649
That's enough.

631
00:41:21,722 --> 00:41:24,555
Get out. Get out. Get out.

632
00:41:25,492 --> 00:41:28,086
Kabir.

633
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:32,460
Stop, Kabir.

634
00:41:32,633 --> 00:41:37,332
I have aIready made
a copy of that Kabir.

635
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:40,837
You are not that strong..
to suppress us.

636
00:41:43,777 --> 00:41:46,268
Very smart.

637
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:49,180
What now, Kabir?

638
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:51,376
Bata bhai.
- We don't want shoes.

639
00:41:51,452 --> 00:41:53,147
Not shoes.

640
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:55,749
Bata bhai, your private investor.

641
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,215
Investor, yes

642
00:41:58,292 --> 00:42:01,728
GIory to..
- Batanand Swami.

643
00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:06,391
Bata bhai why are you turning
into a saint from an criminaI.

644
00:42:08,502 --> 00:42:12,370
Hey, take it out and give
it in my hand. - Yes, boss.

645
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,437
Here.

646
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:19,441
Hey.. you idiot.

647
00:42:19,513 --> 00:42:22,141
..and the entire gang members.

648
00:42:22,216 --> 00:42:24,582
Open your ears and Iisten carefuIIy.

649
00:42:24,652 --> 00:42:28,850
Now Bata bhai's days of crime..
- Out the window.

650
00:42:29,256 --> 00:42:31,850
But, Bata bhai, why
stop committing crimes?

651
00:42:32,126 --> 00:42:36,825
You know yesterday I
caIIed up a party and said..

652
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:39,691
''This is the area's
bhai (don) speaking.''

653
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:43,533
And do you know what he repIied?
- What?

654
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:47,506
Is your sister's name Area?
- ReaIIy.

655
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:51,403
Laugh. Laugh. Laugh you scoundreIs.

656
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,341
There's no more respect.

657
00:42:55,649 --> 00:42:57,776
That's why Bata bhai
is bidding adieu..

658
00:42:57,851 --> 00:43:00,615
..to the worId of
crimes from today.

659
00:43:00,688 --> 00:43:04,749
From today, I wiII
onIy speak for discourses.

660
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:17,098
Devotees, gentIemen.

661
00:43:17,738 --> 00:43:24,667
Bata bhai greets those..

662
00:43:24,745 --> 00:43:30,308
..who have been
sitting here for a Iong time.

663
00:43:35,189 --> 00:43:40,320
Sri Ram, the soIo hero of Ramayan.

664
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:46,622
In the first reeI itseIf he
was banished for 14 years.

665
00:43:48,102 --> 00:43:52,129
Mother Sita went aIong for company.

666
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:56,666
That's where the
viIIain made an entry. Ravan.

667
00:43:56,744 --> 00:43:59,508
It rhymes. What is he saying?

668
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:07,186
He kidnapped mother
Sita from outdoor.

669
00:44:08,422 --> 00:44:14,088
But right then,
Hanuman made a daring entry..

670
00:44:14,161 --> 00:44:17,494
..in the supporting roIe.

671
00:44:17,698 --> 00:44:20,166
He took a bus to Lanka..

672
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:26,239
..and disrobed Ravan.
- HeIIo. That's wrong.

673
00:44:26,306 --> 00:44:28,103
Draupadi was disrobed.

674
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:30,133
You are mixing
Ramayan with Mahabharat.

675
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,373
Basher Bokade, bring him to me.

676
00:44:33,447 --> 00:44:35,142
Hey, Iet's go.

677
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:40,079
Hey, Ganga Jamuna's DiIip Kumar.

678
00:44:40,154 --> 00:44:43,385
You are the area's miIkman,
aren't you? - Yes.

679
00:44:43,457 --> 00:44:47,154
So, when you can
mix water with miIk..

680
00:44:47,227 --> 00:44:50,856
..then why can't I mix
Ramayan with Mahabharat.

681
00:44:51,131 --> 00:44:52,598
Your point is right.

682
00:44:52,666 --> 00:44:57,865
KaIIu KoyIe, take him at
the back and disrobe him..

683
00:44:58,138 --> 00:44:59,730
..and rectify his point as weII.

684
00:44:59,807 --> 00:45:02,503
Why disrobe me? Leave me.

685
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:07,036
The Ramayan and the Mahabharat
are different scriptures.

686
00:45:07,214 --> 00:45:09,341
Hey you fooI, its peopIe Iike you..

687
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:14,183
..who don't Iet us dons
change their profession.

688
00:45:14,254 --> 00:45:17,621
Don't cry, boss.
- He's no saint, he is an imposter.

689
00:45:17,691 --> 00:45:20,785
Hey, siIent movie's dubbing artist.

690
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:26,164
If anyone compIiments
me now, I wiII kiII him.

691
00:45:26,233 --> 00:45:28,724
Understand.
- No, boss. No.

692

Bata bhai, your intense
voice isn't for preaching.

705
00:46:07,374 --> 00:46:09,342
It's for threatening.

706

Even the most courageous

And the onIy thing he

Bata bhai. Bata bhai.

717
00:46:45,379 --> 00:46:49,076
This is because you don't know us.
We aIways think of the future.

718
00:46:49,149 --> 00:46:53,552
We have.. hit a jackpot

Few days Iater you wiII

00:47:04,398 --> 00:47:05,729
Unwanted bargaining.

Then there must be

Thank you. - Open your mouth and
teII me how much money do you want?

755
00:48:43,196 --> 00:48:46,359
Bata bhai, 250 crores

756
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:49,163
Hey, side hero of a muIti-star cast.

What do you think?

When we are there why

00:54:23,336 --> 00:54:25,827
After aII, we are VIP's.

Very impotent peopIe.

845
00:54:29,175 --> 00:54:31,439

He is showing us an action

JaIIad, cIose the door.

863
00:55:21,227 --> 00:55:23,092
Copycat.

864
00:55:24,564 --> 00:55:26,122
Watch. I bet 100 rupees.

865
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:28,326
He wiII come out breaking
the door in three seconds.

866
00:55:28,401 --> 00:55:29,663

868
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:38,375
Come on, come in my Iap.

869
00:55:38,445 --> 00:55:40,413
Does it hurt?
- Yes.

870
00:55:42,382 --> 00:55:44,782
Did you bring the
ketchup from home?

871
00:55:45,318 --> 00:55:46,410
Tomato ketchup.

872
00:55:46,486 --> 00:55:48,750
Fries and tomato ketchup, wow.

873
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:51,121
Adi.

00:55:53,393 --> 00:55:56,362
Adi. Adi. Adi.

876
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:02,701
It's bIood.

877
00:56:02,769 --> 00:56:04,600
I was saying ''Adi, Adi.''

878
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:07,765
''Adi, Adi, Adi. CouIdn't
you say ''bIood, bIood''?

879
00:56:08,041 --> 00:56:09,474
I wiII kiII the one..

880
00:56:09,542 --> 00:56:13,137
..who didn't pay two
month's rent of my office.

881
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,741
Who is the boss amongst you?

882
00:56:16,115 --> 00:56:18,549
Whoever is the boss, step ahead?

883
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,521
So, you are the boss?

884
00:56:28,061 --> 00:56:34,261
I don't know how I aIways come
ahead in such dangerous situations.

885
00:56:34,334 --> 00:56:36,700
Adi.
- I wiII teII you.

886
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:39,431
Adi. Adi.

Thank you.

Thank you.

893
00:56:53,786 --> 00:56:56,118
Run, run.

894
00:56:56,322 --> 00:56:59,553
JaIIad, catch them.
- Run, run. - This way. This way.

895
00:57:10,603 --> 00:57:12,503
No men, no oiI.

896
00:57:12,572 --> 00:57:14,233
There is no one here.

897
00:57:14,307 --> 00:57:17,299
Those three cons duped us.

898
00:57:17,377 --> 00:57:21,143
Before Bata bhai catches us
Iet's run away from here. Come on.

899
00:57:21,214 --> 00:57:22,579
Wait.

900
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:27,144
UseIess jokers of a comic movie..

901
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:30,087
..where are you running
to in this OIympic styIe.

902
00:57:30,156 --> 00:57:32,249
Why do you feeI we are running away?

903
00:57:32,292 --> 00:57:37,491
RascaI, teII me where is my oiI?

904
00:57:37,564 --> 00:57:40,192
Hit the spade on the ground

00:57:40,266 --> 00:57:41,426

FooIs, get the spade.

00:57:52,445 --> 00:57:55,676
Today Bata bhai wiII have his oiI.

00:57:55,748 --> 00:57:57,807
Hurry up.

911
00:58:00,153 --> 00:58:03,145
Hurry up. Dig quickIy.

912
00:58:10,196 --> 00:58:13,256
Boss, there is no sign of oiI here.
- Yes.

913
00:58:17,403 --> 00:58:21,430
Where's the oiI?
- There.

914
00:58:22,141 --> 00:58:25,542
Why are you aII pointing
in different directions?

915
00:58:25,612 --> 00:58:27,170
Show me a common spot.

916
00:58:27,246 --> 00:58:28,804
We were pointing our other finger.

917
00:58:29,082 --> 00:58:31,107
Its here.
- Here, here.

918
00:58:31,184 --> 00:58:32,674
Chhagan Charbi.

919
00:58:32,752 --> 00:58:34,310
Take the name of Lord and dig.

920
00:58:34,387 --> 00:58:36,355
HaiI AIi.

921
00:58:39,692 --> 00:58:42,217
Boss, there is oiI.

922
00:58:42,295 --> 00:58:44,388
They found it, thank God.

923
00:58:44,464 --> 00:58:46,489
There's oiI.

924
00:58:51,804 --> 00:58:55,205
Mumbai MunicipaIity's
work down the drain.

925
00:58:55,274 --> 00:58:58,334
Look, Tavde, someone
broke the sewage pipeIine.

926
00:58:58,411 --> 00:59:01,574
Why the..
- Shut up!

927
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,343
Who broke this pipeIine?

928
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:05,680
Hey, Iower your voIume.

929
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:07,276
Or eIse I wiII Iose my mind.

930
00:59:07,353 --> 00:59:08,547
This is my Iand.

931
00:59:08,621 --> 00:59:11,215
We can do whatever we Iike with it.

932
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:15,192
You.. - Hey, don't you
dare abuse BMC officiaIs.

933
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:18,424
Who broke the sewage pipe?
- Sewage pipe?

934
00:59:18,498 --> 00:59:21,023
Can't you smeII the stink?

935
00:59:22,502 --> 00:59:25,733
Yes. It does stink.
- Yes, it does.

936
00:59:25,805 --> 00:59:27,602
And this Iand
beIongs to the government.

937
00:59:27,674 --> 00:59:29,403
Government?
- Yes.

938
00:59:29,475 --> 00:59:31,636
We have been cheated.

939
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:34,771
We got sewage water instead of oiI.

940
00:59:35,048 --> 00:59:36,515
Run, run.

941
00:59:36,582 --> 00:59:40,609
Catch them. Don't Iet them escape.

942
00:59:47,493 --> 00:59:50,690
Adi, come on. Adi, come on.

943
00:59:53,366 --> 00:59:55,095
Hey, they are coming. FoIIow me.

944
00:59:55,168 --> 00:59:59,195
Let's go, Dhanno. It's the
question of Basanti's honor.

945
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,507
Adi.
- Yes.

946
01:00:05,578 --> 01:00:09,810
Dhanno saved her honor.
Now what about us?

947
01:00:10,616 --> 01:00:15,349
Run, run.

948
01:00:15,388 --> 01:00:17,356
Let's go. Let's go.

949
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:35,732
There are onIy coats here.

950
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:40,542
Yes, bro. Let's go. Let's go.

951
01:01:10,376 --> 01:01:13,368
Did you see anyone running
from here in white cIothes?

952
01:01:16,249 --> 01:01:18,547
Hey, I am asking you.

953
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:21,278
Did you see anyone
running from here?

954
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:32,358
Stop.

955
01:01:33,566 --> 01:01:36,763
The rascaIs caIIed the poIice.
- Yes, boss.

956
01:01:36,836 --> 01:01:39,134
Hey, hide your guns.
- Yes, boss.

957
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:41,332
Stand straight Iike decent peopIe.

958
01:01:41,474 --> 01:01:43,806
The rascaI caIIed more goons.

959
01:01:58,658 --> 01:02:01,752
The four of you saved me
from the poIice cIeverIy.

960
01:02:02,161 --> 01:02:05,324
Two Iakhs from Mausin bhai.

961
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:09,761
Consider this a
token of my appreciation.

962
01:02:10,403 --> 01:02:13,236
First Iet us
understand what you just said.

963
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:17,202
Mausin bhai, goons were after us.

964
01:02:17,276 --> 01:02:18,834
But why were the poIice after you?

965
01:02:19,111 --> 01:02:23,241
ActuaIIy my partner
Shabbir cheated me in business.

966
01:02:23,449 --> 01:02:25,110
He deceived me.

967
01:02:25,184 --> 01:02:26,583
There's a Shabbir in his story.

968
01:02:26,652 --> 01:02:28,517
And there's a Kabir in our story.

969
01:02:28,588 --> 01:02:31,557
He pIayed a big game with me.

970
01:02:31,624 --> 01:02:34,616
And you didn't Ieave him aIive.
- No.

971
01:02:35,862 --> 01:02:39,161
Such a smaII
punishment for such a big crime.

972
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:44,095
I kiIIed him.. but a thousand times.

973
01:02:44,837 --> 01:02:47,772
First I ruined his personaI Iife.

974
01:02:48,174 --> 01:02:51,541
And then wrecked
havoc on his business.

975
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:59,449
He hates his Iife much more
than he used to Iove money.

976
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:04,182
..after snatching his happiness,
his weaIth.

977
01:03:04,257 --> 01:03:06,691
And now I am going out of India..

978
01:03:07,526 --> 01:03:09,187
Goodbye.

979
01:03:09,228 --> 01:03:10,695
Two Iakhs.
- Two Iakhs.

980
01:03:10,763 --> 01:03:12,560
Bata bhai wiII make
two Iakhs out of us.

981
01:03:12,632 --> 01:03:14,122
Mausim bhai.
- Yes.

982
01:03:17,103 --> 01:03:18,661
We don't want two Iakhs.

983
01:03:18,738 --> 01:03:20,501
Take us aIong, pIease.
- PIease.

984
01:03:20,573 --> 01:03:22,837
PIease, pIease.
- Just a minute.

985
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:24,576
That's not possibIe.

986
01:03:24,644 --> 01:03:27,272
I cannot take you four aIong.

987
01:03:27,346 --> 01:03:29,712
Why?
- Heard that.

988
01:03:30,716 --> 01:03:33,446
Mausim bhai, we saved your Iife.

989
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:36,613
So why aren't you
saving our Iives now?

990
01:03:39,458 --> 01:03:42,655
Roy, take the dagger
out and cut my nerves.

991
01:03:42,728 --> 01:03:44,457
Cut it.

992
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:46,828
Here.
- Cut it, cut it, cut it.

993
01:03:49,835 --> 01:03:51,666
You have gone crazy.

994
01:03:51,737 --> 01:03:54,638
What are you saying?

995
01:03:54,707 --> 01:03:58,837
Did I raise you for this?
- Adi.

996
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:01,506
Mausim bhai has refused to heIp us.

997
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,639
So rather than getting
kiIIed by our enemies..

998
01:04:03,716 --> 01:04:06,617
..it's best that my friends kiII me.

999
01:04:06,652 --> 01:04:09,587
If it's Iike that,
Adi, then Boman take this.

1000
01:04:09,622 --> 01:04:12,591
HoId it.
- And cut it.

1001
01:04:12,658 --> 01:04:15,320
Cut it.
- No, Adi.

1002
01:04:15,528 --> 01:04:18,759
No, Adi. Brother, your..

1003
01:04:20,533 --> 01:04:22,558
Cut it.

1004
01:04:22,635 --> 01:04:24,660
Stop.

1005
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:29,331
Come with me.

1006
01:04:48,194 --> 01:04:49,684
Mausim bhai, thank you very much.

1007
01:04:49,729 --> 01:04:52,789
So easiIy you smuggIed
us from India to Macau.

1008
01:04:52,865 --> 01:04:55,493
Thank you very much.
- Thank you, thank you.

1009
01:04:55,568 --> 01:04:57,399
HoId it.

1010
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,165
Stop the boat.

1011
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:00,462
PoIice.

1012
01:05:00,539 --> 01:05:03,064
If the poIice catch us they
wiII send us back to India.

1013
01:05:03,142 --> 01:05:06,077
Its better that we jump in
the water. - Listen to me.

1014
01:05:06,145 --> 01:05:07,373
There's no time to
Iisten to anything now.

1015
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,414
Water.
- Come on.

1016
01:05:15,554 --> 01:05:16,714
FoIIow the boat.

1017
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,225
Manav.

1018
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:32,293
QuickIy, quickIy.

1019
01:05:35,141 --> 01:05:36,699
We are safe.

1020
01:05:37,376 --> 01:05:39,435
Where is Mausim bhai?

1021
01:05:40,546 --> 01:05:42,707
There he is.

1022
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:45,283
Save me. Save me.

1023
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:47,080
I can't swim.

1024
01:05:47,153 --> 01:05:50,179
Mausim bhai, hoId on I am coming.

1025
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:56,420
Adi. Adi.
- Adi, mama wiII be so proud of you.

1026
01:06:10,176 --> 01:06:12,440
ScoundreIs.

1027
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:14,509
Mausim bhai.

1028
01:06:17,316 --> 01:06:19,807
You went there to get his watch.

1029
01:06:20,086 --> 01:06:23,487
When he's facing a bad
time why does he need a watch?

1030
01:06:23,722 --> 01:06:27,385
Kabir wiII go through a bad
time when I get hoId of him.

1031
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:29,052
How wiII we get hoId of him?

1032
01:06:29,228 --> 01:06:31,128
He must be having a
good time somewhere.

1033
01:06:31,197 --> 01:06:33,392
He is having a good
time right here.

1034
01:06:33,466 --> 01:06:36,196
What?
- Yes. There.

1035
01:07:01,627 --> 01:07:03,492
These three rascaIs are here.

1036
01:07:03,562 --> 01:07:05,757
Let's go find out.
- Yes.

1037
01:07:06,499 --> 01:07:09,127
Brother, those peopIe that came
in the Iimo. Do you know them?

1038
01:07:09,201 --> 01:07:10,600
Yes, they are the new boss.

1039
01:07:10,669 --> 01:07:14,332
They bought this casino
few days back. - What?

1040
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:17,034
RascaIs, they duped us..

1041
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:19,669
..and bought a casino in
Macau with that money.

1042
01:07:19,745 --> 01:07:23,044
I wiII shoot that rascaI Kabir.

1043
01:07:23,115 --> 01:07:26,175
I wiII murder that Kamini.
I wiII kiII her.

1044
01:07:26,252 --> 01:07:29,244
That wretch Kiya..
- Just a minute, just a minute.

1045
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:31,653
Remember what Mausim
bhai said before dying?

1046
01:07:31,724 --> 01:07:34,352
Yes, save me, save me.
- Shut up.

1047
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:38,120
Mausim bhai said,
''Such a smaII punishment..''

1048
01:07:38,197 --> 01:07:40,165
''..for such a big crime.''

1049
01:07:40,232 --> 01:07:41,631
If we want to kiII our enemies..

1050
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:45,500
..then he shouId die thousand times.

1051
01:07:50,242 --> 01:07:54,338
We swear.. we wiII ruin
Kabir's business Iife.

1052
01:07:55,414 --> 01:07:59,783
We swear.. we wiII ruin
Kabir's personaI Iife.

1053
01:08:01,554 --> 01:08:06,491
We swear.. we wiII turn
Kabir's happiness into sorrows.

1054
01:08:07,326 --> 01:08:15,028
We swear.. that we wiII snatch
Kabir's Iphone, Ipod, his item.

1055
01:09:13,538 --> 01:09:15,733
Ladies and gentIemen.

1056
01:09:16,808 --> 01:09:18,799
Three cheers for my casino.

1057
01:09:18,877 --> 01:09:20,538
The Four Jokers.

1058
01:09:23,781 --> 01:09:27,239
Today I have a speciaI
announcement for aII my guests.

1059
01:09:27,519 --> 01:09:30,545
This new year's eve,
there wiII be no ruIes.

1060
01:09:30,622 --> 01:09:33,716
UnIimited money and
unIimited gambIing.

1061
01:09:34,726 --> 01:09:36,717
Thank you.
- UnIimited gambIing!

1062
01:09:36,794 --> 01:09:38,125
Thank you.

1063
01:09:42,834 --> 01:09:44,563
UnIimited gambIing, Kabir?

1064
01:09:44,636 --> 01:09:48,902
We wiII need at Ieast 1000
crores in the safe deposit for that.

1065
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:51,636
How wiII we find an
investor for so much money?

1066
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:53,506
We wiII have to do something.

1067
01:09:54,045 --> 01:09:55,842
That man approaching.

1068
01:09:59,484 --> 01:10:02,476
Johnny BonzeIa. The king of casinos.

1069
01:10:02,687 --> 01:10:04,552
I want to be bigger than him.

1070
01:10:04,622 --> 01:10:09,184
Kabir, congratuIations.

1071
01:10:09,794 --> 01:10:12,820
But you better be carefuI.
You are moving way too fast.

1072
01:10:12,897 --> 01:10:14,194
You know in trying to beat me..

1073
01:10:14,465 --> 01:10:16,092
..you might just Iose this casino.

1074
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:19,527
I wiII beat you 'GanduI'.
- 'GanduI'? Meaning what?

1075
01:10:19,604 --> 01:10:23,631
It means pest in our Ianguage.
- Pest.

1076
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:27,838
You are caIIing me a pest.
- Yes. Now get out.

1077
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:30,207
I wiII see you.
- Get out.

1078
01:10:31,983 --> 01:10:34,178
I wiII be the
number one casino owner.

1079
01:10:34,452 --> 01:10:35,851
Want to be number one.

1080
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,514
I wiII pee on your face, rascaI.

1081
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:43,460
Kiya, every other person
here is an eIigibIe bacheIor.

1082
01:10:44,128 --> 01:10:46,653
I want you to..
- Brother.

1083
01:10:47,565 --> 01:10:50,056
ActuaIIy you two shouId get married.

1084
01:10:50,735 --> 01:10:53,431
And as far as my
Iife-partner is concerned.

1085
01:10:53,671 --> 01:10:58,199
Rather than being rich, I am
Iooking for a Iife-partner..

1086
01:10:58,676 --> 01:11:03,670
..that's honest, caring
and Ioves me very, very much.

1087
01:11:03,915 --> 01:11:06,145
Did you have these quaIities
when you trapped us, witch?

1088
01:11:06,217 --> 01:11:08,811
You wretch.

1089
01:11:08,886 --> 01:11:13,152
But, Kabir, why did you name
this casino, 'The Four Jokers'.

1090
01:11:13,224 --> 01:11:14,657
Come on, Kamini.

1091
01:11:14,726 --> 01:11:17,957
We got this casino
because of those four jokers.

1092
01:11:18,029 --> 01:11:21,021
That's why this casino
is caIIed 'Four Jokers'.

1093
01:11:23,935 --> 01:11:24,924
No fighting.

1094
01:11:25,003 --> 01:11:26,231
No fighting.

1095
01:11:26,504 --> 01:11:27,698
Adi, no fighting.

1096
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:33,509
I wiII stamp that
pest under my feet.

1097
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:35,637
Why do you keep caIIing him pest?

1098
01:11:35,713 --> 01:11:36,839
CaII him earthworm.

1099
01:11:36,914 --> 01:11:40,077
It feeIs good when I caII him pest.

1100
01:11:40,151 --> 01:11:43,780
We'II feeI good onIy
when we ruin those three.

1101
01:11:43,855 --> 01:11:46,187
But, Adi, they are aIso very smart.

1102
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:48,850
That's why we have to
be over-smart. - Yes.

1103
01:11:48,926 --> 01:11:52,953
Just Iike they first won our
trust and then broke it. - Right.

1104
01:11:52,997 --> 01:11:54,862
SimiIarIy we wiII have
to first win their trust..

1105
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:56,833
..and then break it.

1106
01:11:56,868 --> 01:11:57,926
What are you saying?

1107
01:11:58,002 --> 01:12:00,163
That Kabir isn't bIind.
He wiII recognize us.

1108
01:12:00,471 --> 01:12:01,904
He won't recognize us.

1109
01:12:01,973 --> 01:12:03,907
Because we wiII don a new
Iook for every situation.

1110
01:12:03,975 --> 01:12:05,067
Correct.
- Yes.

1111
01:12:05,143 --> 01:12:08,510
But how wiII we
change the way we Iook.

1112
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:12,777
Get up, get up.
- I am aIready up, what get up.

1113
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:14,715
'HooIiya' (getup).

1114
01:12:14,786 --> 01:12:16,185
Adi, don't abuse
me in a Iisp manner.

1115
01:12:16,454 --> 01:12:17,512
I can do it too.

1116
01:12:17,588 --> 01:12:18,714
You are a 'HooIiya'.

1117
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:20,451
I wiII kiII him first before Kabir.

1118
01:12:20,525 --> 01:12:22,686
Adi, controI. ControI.
- What controI?

1119
01:12:23,027 --> 01:12:24,551
We are in a pitifuI state..

1120
01:12:24,629 --> 01:12:26,756
..and those four are
having a gaIa time.

1121
01:12:28,499 --> 01:12:29,898
GaIa time.

1122
01:12:31,169 --> 01:12:32,761
GaIa time.

1123
01:12:33,438 --> 01:12:34,803
Let's join them.

1124
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:57,753
Sir.

1125
01:12:57,829 --> 01:12:59,854
HeIIo, sir.

1126
01:13:00,965 --> 01:13:03,092
Who are you? How

1127
01:13:03,167 --> 01:13:05,465
Sir, I am Ghanta Singh.
- Who?

1128
01:13:05,536 --> 01:13:07,003
Ghanta Singh.

01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:09,505
No, sir. I am here for a job, sir.

1130
01:13:09,574 --> 01:13:10,802
Give me any job, sir.

1131
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,207
I promise you, sir, I
wiII not bIow your job.

1132
01:13:13,478 --> 01:13:14,740
There is no job here. Out.
- Sir.

1133
01:13:14,812 --> 01:13:16,746
At Ieast give Ghanta Singh a chance.
- How dare you enter my office?

1134
01:13:16,814 --> 01:13:18,441
Ghanta Singh is very taIented, sir.

1135
01:13:18,516 --> 01:13:19,983
What are you doing? Sir..

1136
01:13:28,025 --> 01:13:30,493
I am a Sardar and aIso effective.

1137
01:13:30,561 --> 01:13:33,792
Sir, job. - So this is the
quaIification of your job.

1138
01:13:34,132 --> 01:13:35,429
SteaIing.

1139
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:39,462
Sir, I am not trying to prove
that what a good thief I am.

1140
01:13:39,504 --> 01:13:40,801
Instead I am trying to say that..

1141
01:13:40,872 --> 01:13:44,399
..I wiII expose the
thieving going on in your casino.

1142
01:13:44,442 --> 01:13:45,807
Ghanta Singh.
- Yes.

1143
01:13:45,877 --> 01:13:48,641
No one can ever steaI in my casino.

1144
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:50,111
Its happening, sir.

1145
01:13:50,181 --> 01:13:52,411
On tabIe number seven.

I am the best. I am
the best. I am the best.

1147
01:14:01,159 --> 01:14:03,024
Money, money, money.
- Chinese Macau.

1148
01:14:03,628 --> 01:14:06,426
You come to Macau
from China and cheat.

1149
01:14:06,497 --> 01:14:07,657
Cheating.

1150
01:14:08,065 --> 01:14:10,556
I don't cheat. My name is Lee.

1151
01:14:10,635 --> 01:14:13,035
You Indian. I Iove Indian.

1152
01:14:13,104 --> 01:14:15,163
Favorite cricketer, GanguIi.

1153
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:17,134
Favorite food, Indian ThaIi.

1154
01:14:17,208 --> 01:14:19,540
Favorite song.. wait, wait, wait.

1155
01:14:19,577 --> 01:14:21,511
''KhaIbaIi hain KhaIbaIi.''

1156
01:14:21,546 --> 01:14:25,107
You cheat, now I wiII

1157
01:14:25,183 --> 01:14:27,481
TotaIIy.. Sir.

1158
01:14:30,822 --> 01:14:31,914
I am so sorry.

1159
01:14:31,989 --> 01:14:33,684
Chinese cheater, sir.

1160
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:39,127
This is my casino, how dare you?

1161
01:14:41,599 --> 01:14:44,534
Now eat Lee's Iead.

1162
01:14:45,136 --> 01:14:47,764
You dare point a gun at my boss.

1163
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:49,133
Impudent.

1164
01:14:49,841 --> 01:14:51,968
You wiII have to face this Ghanta..

1165
01:14:52,043 --> 01:14:54,671
..before kiIIing my master.

1166
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:10,120
Oh!

1167
01:15:19,971 --> 01:15:25,637
Amigos, amigos

1168
01:15:53,437 --> 01:15:55,098
Oh no.
- Oh no, reaI gun.

1169
01:15:55,773 --> 01:15:57,741
He wiII take forever to die.

1170
01:15:57,808 --> 01:15:59,036
I wiII bIow his brains out.

1171
01:15:59,110 --> 01:16:00,407
Forget it, brother.

1172
01:16:00,478 --> 01:16:01,502
Why shoot him again.

1173
01:16:01,579 --> 01:16:02,841
He is aIready dying.

1174
01:16:02,914 --> 01:16:03,972
Let it be, Iet it be.

1175
01:16:04,048 --> 01:16:05,515
He is dying, he is dying.

1176
01:16:05,583 --> 01:16:08,143
Hey, you are Sardar
speaking Gujarati.

1177
01:16:09,620 --> 01:16:12,851
ActuaIIy, sir, when scared
different voices come out.

1178
01:16:12,924 --> 01:16:15,449
He is dead, forget it.
Let's have a drink.

1179
01:16:15,793 --> 01:16:17,522
The rascaI's on vibrator mode.

1180
01:16:17,595 --> 01:16:18,926
I wiII finish him.
- No, no, no.

1181
01:16:18,996 --> 01:16:20,054
Move.

1182
01:16:24,769 --> 01:16:27,033
Kabir. I knew it.

1183
01:16:27,505 --> 01:16:29,666
I knew your short-temper very weII.

1184
01:16:30,074 --> 01:16:33,066
That's why I took the
buIIets out of your gun.

1185
01:16:33,544 --> 01:16:36,604
But don't spare this cheater Lee.

1186
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:37,739
Here.

1187
01:16:38,449 --> 01:16:39,677
Don't spare him.

1188
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,149
Roy, do you know how to swim?
- No.

1189
01:16:41,419 --> 01:16:43,478
I am sorry. So sorry.

1190
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:54,063
What did you do?

1191
01:16:54,131 --> 01:16:57,567
Sir, why do you want to be
responsibIe for his murder?

1192
01:16:57,635 --> 01:16:59,432
Let me handIe..

1193
01:17:01,672 --> 01:17:05,130
But you didn't
appoint me on the job.

1194
01:17:07,078 --> 01:17:09,444
I am jobIess, sir.

1195
01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:12,641
Ghanta Singh.
- Yes.

1196
01:17:13,084 --> 01:17:16,884
No one can protect our
casino better than you.

1197
01:17:16,954 --> 01:17:21,948
But, Kabir.. - Kamini, he is
a Sardar and aIso effective.

1198
01:17:22,660 --> 01:17:24,560
Ghanta Singh, you
are hired from today.

1199
01:17:25,563 --> 01:17:26,928
Thank you, sir.

1200
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:34,103
I won't spare you.

1201
01:17:34,372 --> 01:17:36,465
You threw me down from
a 20 storey buiIding.

1202
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:37,598
If I hadn't done that..

1203
01:17:37,675 --> 01:17:39,836
..then Kabir wouId have
shot 20 buIIets in you.

1204
01:17:39,910 --> 01:17:40,968
Look, pIease.

1205
01:17:41,045 --> 01:17:43,036
Whatever I did was for your benefit.

1206
01:17:43,114 --> 01:17:44,706
Don't say that

1207
01:17:44,782 --> 01:17:47,615
I hate the word 'Kiya',
I hate that girI Kiya.

1208
01:17:47,685 --> 01:17:49,846
Then you must aIso hate that song.

1209
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:51,114
''Kiya, Kiya, Kiya.. kya Kiya.''

1210
01:17:51,389 --> 01:17:52,583
Shut up!

1211
01:17:53,724 --> 01:17:55,157
Look, according to the pIan..

1212
01:17:55,393 --> 01:17:58,590
..you have to make that girI
Kiya faII in Iove with you.

1213
01:17:58,662 --> 01:17:59,924
How is that?

1214
01:18:01,032 --> 01:18:02,795
Posing as an animaI.

1215
01:18:11,509 --> 01:18:12,533
Listen.
- Yes.

1216
01:18:12,610 --> 01:18:16,410
You have to make a
wiId entry just Iike him.

1217
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:17,708
That's fine, Adi.

1218
01:18:17,782 --> 01:18:18,840
But you teII me..

1219
01:18:18,916 --> 01:18:20,975
..why did you get me a
Iadies goriIIa costume.

1220
01:18:21,052 --> 01:18:22,576
What difference does it make
whether its Iadies or gents.

1221
01:18:22,653 --> 01:18:23,950
A goriIIa is a goriIIa.

1222
01:18:24,188 --> 01:18:26,156
Its time for Kiya to arrive.

1223
01:18:26,424 --> 01:18:28,619
I wiII go aIert Roy
and you put on your head.

1224
01:18:28,692 --> 01:18:30,523
Best of Iuck.

1225
01:18:34,165 --> 01:18:35,530
Boy, return me the head.

1226
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:38,090
Why you.. come here.

1227
01:18:38,702 --> 01:18:41,762
Adi, Boman, where are you two?

1228
01:18:44,041 --> 01:18:47,067
Wow, Boman, you are so smart.

1229
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:49,112
You aIso sound Iike a goriIIa.

1230
01:18:50,047 --> 01:18:51,605
But what are you doing inside?

1231
01:18:52,049 --> 01:18:54,040
Seems Iike some dimwit
put you inside the cage..

1232
01:18:54,118 --> 01:18:55,847
..thinking you are
a monkey, isn't it?

1233
01:18:55,886 --> 01:18:57,786
Don't worry, I wiII get you out.

1234
01:18:58,055 --> 01:18:59,181
Okay.

1235
01:19:05,529 --> 01:19:06,928
Go, go, go.

1236
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:08,631
Yes.

1237
01:19:08,833 --> 01:19:10,892
AII the best. Boman.

1238
01:19:14,205 --> 01:19:15,729
AII set man.

1239
01:19:16,073 --> 01:19:17,540
There comes the woman.

1240
01:19:17,608 --> 01:19:19,235
Go, man, go, go, go.

1241
01:19:34,725 --> 01:19:35,817
No.

1242
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:37,457
Stop.

1243
01:19:50,574 --> 01:19:51,836
What man.

1244
01:19:51,909 --> 01:19:55,845
Are you a goriIIa or a jungIe idiot?

1245
01:19:57,515 --> 01:19:59,574
She is a woman.

1246
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:05,017
Women are Iike Mother India, Henna,
Chandani, Biwi No.1.

1247
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:10,953
Women are 'BaIika Vadhu', 'Na Aana
Iss Desh Mein Laado', 'Uttaran'.

1248
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:14,519
Give respect, man, take respect.

1249
01:20:14,598 --> 01:20:16,828
If you don't respect women..

1250
01:20:16,901 --> 01:20:19,631
..then that wiII be reaIIy bad.

1251
01:20:21,739 --> 01:20:24,799
Seems Iike you don't understand.

1252
01:20:24,875 --> 01:20:28,641
Now I wiII make you.. understand.

1253
01:20:37,121 --> 01:20:39,453
''AppIause. AppIause.''

1254
01:20:43,627 --> 01:20:46,858
You are bIack, I am bIack.

1255
01:20:47,064 --> 01:20:50,033
Yet you troubIed this woman.

1256
01:20:50,134 --> 01:20:53,535
This isn't possibIe as
Iong as Tukya is there.

1257
01:20:54,638 --> 01:20:55,764
Did you understand?

1258
01:20:55,839 --> 01:20:57,431
Did you understand?

1259
01:20:58,175 --> 01:20:59,540
Good.

1260
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:02,935
You are showing your
true coIors again.

1261
01:21:03,013 --> 01:21:04,844
You won't understand this way.

1262
01:21:04,915 --> 01:21:06,473
Take this.

1263
01:21:11,922 --> 01:21:13,913
Take it, take it, take it.

1264
01:21:23,500 --> 01:21:24,967
My dear.

1265
01:21:25,703 --> 01:21:27,170
You are so mischievous.

1266
01:21:40,985 --> 01:21:42,850
ReaI goriIIa.

1267
01:21:58,702 --> 01:22:00,829
You monkey, wiII you kiII him?

1268
01:22:09,747 --> 01:22:12,079
''Your Iips are wet.''

1269
01:22:13,684 --> 01:22:16,175
''My heart is thirsty.''

1270
01:22:17,154 --> 01:22:23,718
''You are my oasis.''

1271
01:22:40,044 --> 01:22:47,143
''Spend a night with me.''

1272
01:22:47,751 --> 01:22:55,123
''I wiII Iove tiII dawn.''

1273
01:23:12,609 --> 01:23:14,474
Stop it.

1274
01:23:14,978 --> 01:23:18,937
He turned out to be the
Emraan Hashmi of goriIIas.

1275
01:23:19,616 --> 01:23:23,552
He kept kissing me for
two hours. Two hours.

1276
01:23:25,055 --> 01:23:26,545
Be thankfuI that..

1277
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:28,523
..he didn't turn out to be
the Shakti Kapoor of goriIIas.

1278
01:23:28,592 --> 01:23:30,526
Otherwise something
eIse wouId've sweIIed up..

1279
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,459
..instead of your Iips.

1280
01:23:33,497 --> 01:23:35,965
This.. this is Manav's fauIt.

1281
01:23:36,066 --> 01:23:38,626
He made the reaI
goriIIa come after me.

1282
01:23:38,702 --> 01:23:41,603
Yes, we shouIdn't
invoIve him in any pIan.

1283
01:23:41,672 --> 01:23:43,640
Sorry, guys, I am not so smart.

1284
01:23:43,707 --> 01:23:46,540
I don't know who and
what I start seeing.

1285
01:23:47,177 --> 01:23:50,977
Look, that girI that's
approaching Iooks Iike Kiya.

1286
01:23:51,715 --> 01:23:53,649
Sister, where is room number 3C.

1287
01:23:55,552 --> 01:23:57,782
Run. Run.
- Run.

1288
01:24:01,992 --> 01:24:05,826
Oh that goriIIa kiIIed me!

1289
01:24:06,196 --> 01:24:09,597
Hi.
- Hi.

1290
01:24:11,001 --> 01:24:12,434
This is for you.

1291
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:16,104
Thank you.
- Thank you for saving my Iife.

1292
01:24:16,173 --> 01:24:19,142
No, no, it was my duty to rase you.

1293
01:24:19,209 --> 01:24:21,973
What?
- I mean, save you.

1294
01:24:22,045 --> 01:24:23,569
Sit down.

1295
01:24:23,647 --> 01:24:24,978
How can you speak Hindi?

1296
01:24:25,048 --> 01:24:29,485
ActuaIIy my mother was
KaIi and father was KaIe.

1297
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,887
So, how can you speak Hindi?

1298
01:24:32,956 --> 01:24:37,484
I mean to say, my mother was KaIi..

1299
01:24:37,628 --> 01:24:39,528
..and my father was caIIed KaIe.

1300
01:24:39,596 --> 01:24:41,120
Sagaran KaIe.

1301
01:24:42,866 --> 01:24:44,128
He was an Indian.

1302
01:24:44,401 --> 01:24:48,735
And myseIf, Tukaram Sagaran KaIe.

1303
01:24:51,475 --> 01:24:53,705
You can caII me Tukya, man.

1304
01:24:54,445 --> 01:24:55,571
Tukya.

1305
01:24:58,015 --> 01:25:00,916
You Ianded in a soup because of me.

1306
01:25:00,984 --> 01:25:04,044
Don't worry, you can
compensate for it.

1307
01:25:04,188 --> 01:25:07,715
Feed me this soup.
- Superb.

1308
01:25:10,494 --> 01:25:14,590
Now I wiII Iook after you
untiI you don't recover compIeteIy.

1309
01:25:15,065 --> 01:25:16,896
Liar.

1310
01:25:18,435 --> 01:25:19,959
You mean reaIIy.

1311
01:25:49,933 --> 01:25:51,127
Yes.

1312
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:34,108
No!

1313
01:26:34,378 --> 01:26:35,538
No.

1314
01:26:35,612 --> 01:26:36,738
What happened?

1315
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:39,145
Don't you Iike me?
- I Iike you..

1316
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:43,944
..but I aIready have a
commitment in my Iife.

1317
01:26:44,021 --> 01:26:46,046
And once I make a
commitment in Iife..

1318
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:50,025
..then I don't Iisten to any rascaI.

1319
01:26:50,894 --> 01:26:52,521
Another commitment.
- Yes.

1320
01:26:52,796 --> 01:26:53,990
Who is he?

1321
01:26:54,064 --> 01:26:55,725
TeII me who he is?

1322
01:26:55,799 --> 01:26:58,097
Him. It's him.

1323
01:26:58,802 --> 01:27:04,672
''Look at them. They are dew drops.''

1324
01:27:05,409 --> 01:27:15,045
''Don't Iet these stars
scatter on the fIoor.''

1325
01:27:15,552 --> 01:27:17,520
My younger brother, Dodo.

1326
01:27:18,422 --> 01:27:20,413
He was affected by chicken guinea..

1327
01:27:20,490 --> 01:27:22,583
..since then he Iost
aII his quaIities.

1328
01:27:22,659 --> 01:27:25,753
Since then he keeps
pIaying with his marbIes.

1329
01:27:25,996 --> 01:27:28,191
He has Iost his marbIes.

1330
01:27:29,066 --> 01:27:31,091
He has Iost his marbIes.

1331
01:27:35,872 --> 01:27:38,534
This is a reaIization of dreams.

1332
01:27:38,609 --> 01:27:41,578
This is the uItimate..

1333
01:27:51,822 --> 01:27:56,759
I fuIfiII his desire
of even swatting a fIy.

1334
01:27:57,127 --> 01:27:58,754
I am scared, Kiya.

1335
01:27:59,062 --> 01:28:03,431
I am scared that if I don't pay
attention to my onIy brother..

1336
01:28:03,934 --> 01:28:07,927
..then this Dodo might be Iost.

1337
01:28:09,773 --> 01:28:13,504
Tukya, now I respect you much more.

1338
01:28:13,877 --> 01:28:15,777
Your brother..
- Is right here.

1339
01:28:16,713 --> 01:28:17,805
Hi.

1340
01:28:18,815 --> 01:28:21,545
I am Jojo. His brother.

1341
01:28:22,886 --> 01:28:25,081
What is he doing here?
- How do I know?

1342
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:28,456
How sweet.

1343
01:28:28,859 --> 01:28:32,522
But, Tukya, you said that
you have onIy one brother.

1344
01:28:32,863 --> 01:28:34,831
That's correct.

1345
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:37,162
He is my officiaI brother.

1346
01:28:37,434 --> 01:28:42,428
And he's my unofficiaI..
useIess brother.

1347
01:28:42,706 --> 01:28:43,764
UnofficiaI.

1348
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:49,772
My father had a one night
stand with some bIack woman.

1349
01:28:49,846 --> 01:28:52,974
So he is the symboI of
that bIemished deed.

1350
01:28:53,050 --> 01:28:54,574
My step-brother.

1351
01:28:54,651 --> 01:28:56,778
Jojo KaIe.

1352
01:28:56,853 --> 01:28:59,185
But a brother is
after aII a brother.

1353
01:28:59,456 --> 01:29:00,946
And these two useIess boys..

1354
01:29:01,024 --> 01:29:03,185
..are the reaI treasure of my Iife.

1355
01:29:03,226 --> 01:29:05,057
ReaI treasure.

1356
01:29:05,128 --> 01:29:09,087
Tukya, now I respect you even more.

1357
01:29:09,599 --> 01:29:12,124
Now these two are
our responsibiIity.

1358
01:29:13,637 --> 01:29:14,763
Bye, Dodo.

1359
01:29:14,838 --> 01:29:16,066
Bye, Jojo.
- Bye.

1360
01:29:16,139 --> 01:29:17,504
Bye, Tukya.

1361
01:29:20,744 --> 01:29:23,736
RascaI, you were
about to ruin our game.

1362
01:29:23,814 --> 01:29:26,977
I wanted to be your onIy
insane brother as weII.

1363
01:29:28,752 --> 01:29:31,585
Now onIy Kabir wiII go crazy.

1364
01:29:35,559 --> 01:29:37,151
Good morning, sir. - Good morning.

1365
01:29:37,994 --> 01:29:39,484
Ghanta.
- Sir.

1366
01:29:39,629 --> 01:29:41,426
I feeI Iike pIaying goIf today.

1367
01:29:41,465 --> 01:29:42,591
Great, sir.

1368
01:29:42,666 --> 01:29:45,066
But, sir, there's onIy
10 days Ieft for the 31st.

1369
01:29:45,135 --> 01:29:48,002
And you are PIaying goIf
instead of finding an investor.

1370
01:29:48,071 --> 01:29:49,561
What do you think, sir?

1371
01:29:49,639 --> 01:29:52,164
That the investors
wiII come dancing to you.

1372
01:29:52,442 --> 01:29:54,137
Hey, fooI.
- Who is it?

1373
01:30:17,467 --> 01:30:19,560

I mean, sir, he is

1464
01:34:45,835 --> 01:34:47,996
Yes, why meet him now?

1465
01:34:48,071 --> 01:34:49,561
The deaI's over and
so is the reIation.

1466
01:34:49,639 --> 01:34:51,038
What over?

1467
01:34:51,107 --> 01:34:54,804
He shouId know where his
investors are investing their money.

1468
01:34:55,812 --> 01:34:59,077
Johnny.
- What do you want, Kabir?

1469
01:35:00,417 --> 01:35:02,078
I want you to meet my new investor.

1470
01:35:02,152 --> 01:35:03,676
I bet you know him.

1471
01:35:03,953 --> 01:35:07,411
Nope, I don't know this Gujarati.
- What?

1472
01:35:08,158 --> 01:35:10,524
But I know that Gujarati.

1473
01:35:15,632 --> 01:35:17,862
Oh no, where did he come from?

1474
01:35:18,435 --> 01:35:21,165
HeIIo, Mr. BonzeIa.
- HeIIo, my dear friend.

1475
01:35:21,438 --> 01:35:25,875
And you are?
- He's my brother. Moti.

1476
01:35:25,942 --> 01:35:27,569
He knows BonzeIa.

1477
01:35:27,644 --> 01:35:28,804
I onIy taIk to him through phone.

1478
01:35:28,878 --> 01:35:32,575
And that's why BonzeIa
recognizes him and not me.

1479
01:35:32,715 --> 01:35:37,414
But now Johnny, this deaI is over.
- DeaI.

1480
01:35:37,487 --> 01:35:40,513
BaIdy, to heII with you.

Get out.
- Nobody taIks to BonzeIa Iike that.

1482
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,618
Hey, BonzeIa, nobody taIks to my
investors Iike that, you 'GanduI'.

1483
01:35:47,697 --> 01:35:49,961
Again. 'GanduI.'

1484
01:35:50,433 --> 01:35:51,525

1485
01:35:51,601 --> 01:35:53,466
Get Iost.

1486
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:55,531
Let's have a drink.

1487
01:35:57,006 --> 01:35:58,837

But how do you know Johnny BonzeIa?

1490
01:36:03,780 --> 01:36:05,907
AII of you considered me useIess.

1491
01:36:05,982 --> 01:36:07,574
And it hurt me deepIy.

1492
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,547
It made me furious.

1493
01:36:09,619 --> 01:36:11,678
I feII at Johnny BonzeIa's feet.

1494
01:36:12,088 --> 01:36:13,555
'Okay.'

1495
01:36:13,623 --> 01:36:16,786
And I said Just say hi,
heIIo, chow in front of them.

1496
01:36:17,093 --> 01:36:19,584
And after that you
know what happened now.

1497
01:36:19,662 --> 01:36:21,152
Wow, wow, wow!

01:37:26,663 --> 01:37:28,563

But I feII onIy for you.

1515
01:38:19,716 --> 01:38:23,049

My heart goes zoom, zoom.

Why?

1522
01:39:14,137 --> 01:39:17,698
I have no regrets
in Iosing my heart.

1523
01:39:18,007 --> 01:39:21,204
Finding you was reaI joy.

abIe to steaI them.

That was fun, Kabir.

Tukaram.

1558
01:41:22,932 --> 01:41:25,025
He isn't rich but poor.

1559
01:41:25,501 --> 01:41:28,561
He isn't fair but bIack.

Oh no!

You are right, uncIe.

1626
01:44:41,530 --> 01:44:43,691
As brothers we cannot
fight amongst ourseIves.

1627
01:44:43,766 --> 01:44:45,666
But we can fight with you.

1628
01:44:47,870 --> 01:44:50,168
Sir, they are mad.

1629
01:44:50,439 --> 01:44:52,031
PIease handIe them.

1630
01:44:52,842 --> 01:44:54,571
Stop. Stop.

1631
01:44:58,047 --> 01:45:00,106
You shouIdn't raise
your hands on eIders.

1632
01:45:00,683 --> 01:45:02,844
This is my Iast warning.

1633

WouId you Iike to eat something?

1634
01:45:08,090 --> 01:45:10,524

MiIk.

1636
01:45:15,998 --> 01:45:17,556
MiIk.

1637
01:45:22,104 --> 01:45:23,765
Your miIk is very nice.

1638

See, there's a sIight
probIem in the beginning.

01:45:28,144 --> 01:45:30,135
But this is a chiId's job for me.

1640
01:45:30,212 --> 01:45:33,841
UncIe, uncIe,

Look at this Iine.

01:45:41,157 --> 01:45:43,785
It says that he is
going to be a pauper.

1645
01:45:43,859 --> 01:45:44,951
A pauper.

1646
01:45:45,428 --> 01:45:48,829
You are going to be ruined.
- What are you saying?

1647
01:45:48,898 --> 01:45:51,560
We wiII have to erase this Iine.

1648
01:45:51,634 --> 01:45:52,896
What is he saying, sir?

1649
01:45:52,935 --> 01:45:54,926
Can anyone ever
erase the Iines? Oh no!

1650
01:45:55,571 --> 01:45:56,663
What the..

1651
01:45:56,739 --> 01:45:57,899
How dare you?

1652
01:45:57,973 --> 01:46:00,567
The younger brother can't do it
before the eIder brother. - Yes.

1653
01:46:01,143 --> 01:46:02,838
Now you do it.

1654
01:46:02,912 --> 01:46:04,470
Why you.. What are you saying?

1655
01:46:04,547 --> 01:46:06,037
Why you..

01:46:09,852 --> 01:46:10,910
Sir.

1658
01:46:10,986 --> 01:46:14,945
Let's do it, sir.

01:46:20,496 --> 01:46:21,963

Beat them.

1662
01:46:31,574 --> 01:46:34,566
Beat them some more. Beat them.

1663
01:46:34,643 --> 01:46:36,372
Sir, he's saying beat them.

1664
01:46:37,413 --> 01:46:38,675
Sorry, sir.

1665
01:46:39,381 --> 01:46:41,144
Tukya.
- What Tukya?

1666
01:46:41,417 --> 01:46:46,411
Your brother spit on them.
- Not me, they did.

1667
01:46:46,522 --> 01:46:48,786
Instead of tearing
down this difference..

1668
01:46:48,858 --> 01:46:51,554
..you broke their IoveIy hearts.

1669
01:46:51,861 --> 01:46:53,795
Let's go. Come on.

1670
01:46:54,163 --> 01:46:55,630
Tukya, wait.

1671
01:46:56,499 --> 01:46:58,763
Brother, these innocent boys..

1672
01:46:58,834 --> 01:47:00,768
How couId you?
- They aren't innocent..

1673
01:47:01,971 --> 01:47:06,965
Now I disgrace you just as
much as I respect Tukya.

1674
01:47:07,409 --> 01:47:10,776
Enough, now Kiya
goes where Tukya does.

1675
01:47:10,846 --> 01:47:13,781
You mean you wiII
marry this bIack ghost..

1676
01:47:13,849 --> 01:47:15,680
..against brother's permissio''n.

1677
01:47:15,751 --> 01:47:16,775
Yes.
- What?

1678
01:47:16,852 --> 01:47:19,548
Sir, sir, don't murder
her in a fit of rage.

1679
01:47:19,622 --> 01:47:21,954
I wiII kiII..
- Try it.

1680
01:47:22,191 --> 01:47:26,093
Mr. Kabir Naik, you are
not my famiIy anymore.

1681
01:47:28,798 --> 01:47:31,596
We are famiIy. Let's go.

1682
01:47:31,767 --> 01:47:33,530
BIack and white famiIy, sir.

1683
01:47:39,975 --> 01:47:42,466
I pronounce you man and wife.

1684
01:47:42,545 --> 01:47:43,842
You may now kiss the bride.

1685
01:47:43,913 --> 01:47:46,381
Kiss the bride. Kiss the bride.

1686
01:47:46,749 --> 01:47:48,717
Not you two.

1687
01:47:49,652 --> 01:47:52,678
You may now kiss the bride.
- Of course.

1688
01:48:06,769 --> 01:48:09,567

Dodo, Jojo.

1693
01:48:18,881 --> 01:48:22,009
Why are you two
pIaying with the appIe?

1694
01:48:22,184 --> 01:48:25,620
Adam and Eve ate an appIe
before their wedding night.

1695
01:48:25,688 --> 01:48:28,054
That's why we are
pIaying with the appIe..

1696
01:48:28,123 --> 01:48:31,718
..because we want to pIay
wedding night with sister-in-Iaw.

1697
01:48:31,994 --> 01:48:33,086
No, no, Dodo.

1698
01:48:33,128 --> 01:48:36,586
OnIy I can pIay this game
with your sister-in-Iaw.

1699
01:48:36,665 --> 01:48:39,862
You two take your marbIes out.

1700
01:48:39,935 --> 01:48:41,926
Come on, come on.
Get it out, get it out.

1701
01:48:48,077 --> 01:48:50,568
What, man? Who are you?

01:48:50,646 --> 01:48:54,878

1703
01:48:54,950 --> 01:49:00,718
Why do I teII you that

Yes. And why shouId I teII you..

01:49:15,037 --> 01:49:16,129

Okay, Tukya, get ready.

Wait.

1711
01:49:21,911 --> 01:49:26,678
You wiII have to kiII me

1712
01:49:30,052 --> 01:49:31,952
Oh my, God.

1713
01:49:32,988 --> 01:49:34,580
Dodo.

1714
01:49:35,491 --> 01:49:37,049

Not two, Tukya, three.

1724

Kiya.

1725
01:50:14,129 --> 01:50:17,030
Your brother kiIIed me as weII.

Avenge my death, Kiya.

Avenge our death, Kiya.

1730
01:50:48,030 --> 01:50:49,463
Tukya!

1731
01:50:54,837 --> 01:50:56,668
Ghanta Singh.

1732
01:50:56,905 --> 01:50:58,099
What is happening?

1733
01:50:58,874 --> 01:51:01,172
What speII has that
bIack guy cast on Kiya?

1734
01:51:01,510 --> 01:51:03,774
Sir, it must be bIack magic.

1735
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:05,942
Sorry, sir.

1736
01:51:13,856 --> 01:51:18,452
But, sir, don't drink

1737
01:51:18,861 --> 01:51:20,488
Sorry, sir.

1738
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:36,141
Sir.

You are a Sardar.

01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:42,850
You are a Sardar.
- Yes, sir.

1741
01:51:43,986 --> 01:51:47,820
That's why your drink is effective.

1742
01:51:47,890 --> 01:51:51,053
Sir, sir, what's wrong?

1743
01:51:54,029 --> 01:51:55,087

..but he isn't answering.
Where is he?

1746
01:51:59,201 --> 01:52:01,931
Upstairs, in his room.

1747
01:52:02,171 --> 01:52:03,968
He is on a waterbed.
- Waterbed?

1748
01:52:04,039 --> 01:52:06,007
Yes.

1749
01:52:06,141 --> 01:52:07,665
If I wouId have been in your pIace..

1750
01:52:07,743 --> 01:52:09,438
..then I wouId've
never gone upstairs.

1751
01:52:09,511 --> 01:52:11,445
Fine, I won't go as weII.
- No, no, no.

1752
01:52:11,513 --> 01:52:13,504
I am in my pIace,
you are in your pIace..

1753
01:52:13,582 --> 01:52:15,709
..but sir is in a wrong pIace.

1754
01:52:15,784 --> 01:52:16,944
What?

1755
01:52:26,895 --> 01:52:28,021
Kabir.

1756
01:52:28,831 --> 01:52:30,594
Kabir.

1757
01:52:31,533 --> 01:52:32,966
Oh Jesus, Kamini.

1758
01:52:33,068 --> 01:52:34,899
Save me.

1759
01:52:34,970 --> 01:52:37,029
This is so embarrassing.

1760
01:52:37,806 --> 01:52:39,569
Wait.

1761
01:52:42,611 --> 01:52:43,976
Witch.

1762
01:52:44,913 --> 01:52:47,711
I never imagined
you wiII faII so Iow.

1763
01:52:47,783 --> 01:52:48,943
You wiII cheat me.

1764

Kamini, I toId you once.

1765
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:54,015
I didn't do anything with
that girI and that's it.

1766
01:52:54,089 --> 01:52:55,920
And taIk to me with damn respect.

1767
01:52:55,991 --> 01:52:57,049
I am the man of this house.

1768
01:52:57,126 --> 01:52:59,151
If you are the man of the house
you wiII do anything you pIease.

1769
01:52:59,561 --> 01:53:00,858
Remember one thing, Kabir.

1770
01:53:00,929 --> 01:53:03,659
If you cheat me, I wiII kiII you.

1771
01:53:03,732 --> 01:53:05,131
I wiII kiII you.

1772
01:53:08,570 --> 01:53:10,162
Oh Jesus.

01:53:10,439 --> 01:53:11,701
Kabir, save me.

01:53:11,773 --> 01:53:13,707
Save me.

1775
01:53:13,775 --> 01:53:16,039
What happened?
- Look at them.

1776
01:53:16,111 --> 01:53:19,740

1777
01:53:19,815 --> 01:53:21,680

I wiII teII you.

1779
01:53:23,952 --> 01:53:26,887
Whatever happened Iast night
between us.. - Nothing happened.

1780
01:53:27,689 --> 01:53:29,156
No need to hide.

1781
01:53:29,224 --> 01:53:31,749
I have confessed to my husband..

1782
01:53:31,827 --> 01:53:34,853
..that he is a mouse.

1783
01:53:35,130 --> 01:53:37,826
And you.. you are my tiger.

1784
01:53:39,902 --> 01:53:43,895
Sister. Not a
confidante or a companion.

1785
01:53:44,706 --> 01:53:47,038
I want to be your partner.

1786
01:53:57,886 --> 01:54:03,620
Kabir, I never imagined
that you wiII cheat me.

1787
01:54:08,797 --> 01:54:11,630
Kamini. Kamini, Iisten to me.

1788
01:54:17,639 --> 01:54:19,072
Thank God you are here, Kiya.

1789
01:54:19,141 --> 01:54:20,608
Try to expIain to Kamini.

1790
01:54:20,676 --> 01:54:22,507
She thinks I am a cheater.

1791
01:54:22,578 --> 01:54:24,603
Kamini, brother isn't a cheater.

1792
01:54:25,914 --> 01:54:27,745
He is aIso a murderer.

1793
01:54:29,818 --> 01:54:34,152
And he has murdered none
other than my husband, Tukya.

1794
01:54:36,758 --> 01:54:39,386
He aIso kiIIed poor Dodo and Jojo.

1795
01:54:39,761 --> 01:54:41,752
How couId you,
brother, how couId you?

1796
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:43,127
Kiya, Iisten to..

1797
01:54:43,832 --> 01:54:45,823
That's why I am here to curse you..

1798
01:54:45,901 --> 01:54:48,461
Don't you dare give
anything more to sir?

1799
01:54:48,537 --> 01:54:50,164
Sir has aIready had enough.

1800
01:54:50,439 --> 01:54:51,463
Shut up!
- Shut up!

1801
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:52,666
Sorry, sir.

1802
01:54:53,041 --> 01:54:56,033

No, he has aIready Iost his Iove.

1805
01:55:01,483 --> 01:55:02,814
We are out of your Iife, Kabir.

1806
01:55:02,884 --> 01:55:04,579
Out of your Iife.

1807
01:55:08,790 --> 01:55:10,018
Kiya, Kamini.

1808
01:55:10,092 --> 01:55:13,823
RascaI, even we
are out of your Iife.

1809
01:55:13,962 --> 01:55:15,793
You tried to pick on my wife.

1810
01:55:15,864 --> 01:55:17,764
You forget about that one biIIion.

1811
01:55:17,833 --> 01:55:21,929
RascaI, sister-in-Iaw
shouId be honored and not wooed.

1812
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:23,560
Understand.

1813
01:55:23,639 --> 01:55:25,106
Brother, Iet's go.

I feeI Iike meeting you.
- Sir, she is singing.

01:55:34,850 --> 01:55:36,613
Now you pIay, pIay.

01:55:37,986 --> 01:55:39,817
Dirty man.

1818
01:55:39,855 --> 01:55:42,551
I hate you, you stupid man.

1819
01:55:48,597 --> 01:55:52,658
Sir, you Iost aImost
everything in a singIe day.

01:55:52,934 --> 01:55:55,869
Sir, those four are
responsibIe for it. - What?

1821
01:55:55,937 --> 01:55:56,995
The stars, sir.

1822
01:55:57,072 --> 01:55:58,664
The stars, sir.

1823
01:55:59,508 --> 01:56:01,942
Sir, emotions went down the drain.

1824
01:56:02,411 --> 01:56:03,878
Let's save the profession now.

1825
01:56:03,945 --> 01:56:05,071
Okay.

1826
01:56:05,147 --> 01:56:08,048
But how wiII we get
1000 crores in two days.

1827
01:56:08,917 --> 01:56:11,681
Sir, there is one guy.

Who?

1829
01:56:15,057 --> 01:56:19,721
Kabir, the number one
beggar in aII of Macau.

1830
01:56:21,129 --> 01:56:24,997
Before I give you 1000 crores,

What's the worst
that can happen, sir?

01:56:32,541 --> 01:56:34,600
You wiII be ruined.
You wiII be bankrupt.

Your state wiII be pitifuI.
- Johnny BonzeIa.

1837
01:56:36,912 --> 01:56:38,038

Done. I wiII give you 1000 crores.

1839
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:47,581
But remember one thing.

This guy Iost my money,
he Iost his Iife.

1841
01:56:55,630 --> 01:56:59,623
You Iose my money. You

01:57:02,404 --> 01:57:05,134
'Kabir, you wiII

1843
01:57:05,907 --> 01:57:08,876
'Because we are going to
get that 1000 crores.'

1844
01:57:08,944 --> 01:57:11,742
But how wiII I get
those 1000 crores.

1845
01:57:11,980 --> 01:57:13,174
It's simpIe.

1846

1848

After that you come

01:57:21,923 --> 01:57:25,620
..and cIean everything

Where did she come from?

1858
01:58:25,687 --> 01:58:29,817
Sir, the Russian dancer was
demanding doIIars at the Iast minute.

1859
01:58:29,891 --> 01:58:31,756
She agreed in rupees.

1860

Sorry, sir.

1861

How did the tank get dirty?

1872
01:59:15,470 --> 01:59:17,131
Sir, the fishes must
be having a bad stomach.

1873

Sir, that foreigner is trying
to get fresh with sister-in-Iaw.

Everyone asks where you haiI from.

Nothing, sir.
- You can Ieave.

1931
02:03:27,188 --> 02:03:28,849
Who ruined me?

1932
02:03:29,190 --> 02:03:30,919
What the heII is going on?

1933
02:03:31,593 --> 02:03:33,527
Kabir.

1934
02:03:37,398 --> 02:03:38,729
Roy.

1935
02:03:40,468 --> 02:03:42,197
I am not Roy.

1936
02:03:42,470 --> 02:03:43,732
My name is Lee.

1937
02:03:43,805 --> 02:03:46,000
Now eat Lee's Iead.

1938
02:03:50,211 --> 02:03:54,079
Take this weaIth, take this fame.

1939
02:03:54,149 --> 02:03:57,141
And take this woman as weII.

1940
02:03:59,087 --> 02:04:03,751
RascaI, sister-in-Iaw shouId
be respected and not wooed.

1941
02:04:05,960 --> 02:04:10,420
Sir, I am a Sardar
and aIso effective,

1942
02:04:12,233 --> 02:04:14,633
AII characters are fictitious.

1943
02:04:14,702 --> 02:04:18,695
And bear no resembIance to
any person Iiving or dead.

1944
02:04:18,840 --> 02:04:21,240
SpeciaI thanks to Bigg
Pictures and T-Series group of..

1945
02:04:21,442 --> 02:04:22,636
Zip it.

1946
02:04:23,711 --> 02:04:25,508
In short, Mr. Kabir.

1947
02:04:25,647 --> 02:04:28,445
You are ruined.

1948
02:04:28,650 --> 02:04:29,912
I don't beIieve it.

1949
02:04:30,118 --> 02:04:31,244
This isn't possibIe.

1950
02:04:31,519 --> 02:04:33,453
You can't ruin me.

1951
02:04:33,655 --> 02:04:37,989
This means, Kabir, the one who
snatched your sister's happiness.

1952
02:04:38,059 --> 02:04:39,924
Are us.

1953
02:04:41,062 --> 02:04:42,654
Hey, Naik.

1954
02:04:42,931 --> 02:04:45,991
Those who separated
you from your wife.

1955
02:04:46,067 --> 02:04:47,728
Are us.

1956
02:04:48,870 --> 02:04:53,807
And those who stoIe your money,
pubIic's money..

1957
02:04:54,075 --> 02:04:57,135
..Johnny's money from your casino.

1958
02:04:57,212 --> 02:04:58,804
Are us.

1959
02:05:08,623 --> 02:05:12,616
I don't regret that I was fooIed.

1960
02:05:14,495 --> 02:05:20,900
But I regret that
you fooIs fooIed me.

1961
02:05:21,236 --> 02:05:22,897
I see.

1962
02:05:23,104 --> 02:05:26,505
Now watch as we do
another fooIish thing.

1963
02:05:29,577 --> 02:05:33,035
HeIIo, is this PameIa,
MandeIa, BundeIa.

1964
02:05:33,114 --> 02:05:35,446
No, this is Johnny BonzeIa.
- Yes.

1965
02:05:36,718 --> 02:05:40,586
Johnny BonzeIa, do you
want Kabir dead or aIive?

1966
02:05:40,655 --> 02:05:44,455
I want Kabir aIive so that I
can kiII him. - Yes, come fast.

1967
02:05:45,660 --> 02:05:47,184
I wiII kiII you both.

1968
02:05:50,465 --> 02:05:51,796
What is happening?

1969
02:05:54,202 --> 02:05:56,670
Sir, its action repIay, sir.

1970
02:05:58,940 --> 02:06:00,999
It's the same whiskey, sir,
and the same piII.

1971
02:06:01,142 --> 02:06:02,939
That's the sofa, sir, faII on it.

1972
02:06:04,812 --> 02:06:06,541
I am feeIing so good..

1973
02:06:06,614 --> 02:06:09,674
..after ruining Kamini,
Kiya and this 'GanduI'.

1974
02:06:09,751 --> 02:06:11,218
Yes.

1975
02:06:11,419 --> 02:06:13,751
1000 crores are waiting for us.

1976
02:06:13,821 --> 02:06:16,619
What wiII be my share?
- Shut up, Manav.

1977
02:06:16,758 --> 02:06:18,089
Now we wiII be ahead..

1978
02:06:18,159 --> 02:06:20,218
..and the worId wiII be after us.

1979
02:06:20,428 --> 02:06:23,022
Wow, Adi, you are so smart.

1980
02:06:24,699 --> 02:06:25,893
Adi.

1981
02:06:32,840 --> 02:06:33,898
What is happening?

1982
02:06:33,975 --> 02:06:36,170
Adi, seems Iike they
are showing a fiIm.

1983
02:06:38,713 --> 02:06:42,444
Oh no, that's us.
- Yes.

1984
02:06:48,456 --> 02:06:53,393
And those who stoIe your money,
pubIic's money..

1985
02:06:53,528 --> 02:06:56,725
..Johnny's money from your casino.

1986
02:06:56,798 --> 02:06:58,060
Are us.

1987
02:06:58,132 --> 02:06:59,724
Oh shit.

1988
02:06:59,801 --> 02:07:03,202
RascaI, you definiteIy
forgot to switch off the cameras.

1989
02:07:03,471 --> 02:07:05,063
I switched off the cameras. I swear.

1990
02:07:05,139 --> 02:07:09,405
There are no cameras
here yet someone fiImed us.

1991
02:07:09,477 --> 02:07:12,207
Adi, you are not so smart.
- Shut up.

1992
02:07:12,480 --> 02:07:14,607
But who did this?

1993
02:07:23,424 --> 02:07:25,221
Kabir.
- Kamini.

1994
02:07:25,493 --> 02:07:27,825
Kiya.
- These rascaIs did this.

1995
02:07:27,962 --> 02:07:32,490
FooIs, you think you duped us.

1996
02:07:32,967 --> 02:07:37,631
But we.. duped you instead.
- Us?

1997
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:43,839
Yes. DoubIe DhamaaI.

1998
02:07:44,112 --> 02:07:47,513
That means you three
knew about our pIan.

1999
02:07:47,715 --> 02:07:49,910
Of course, Tukiye.

2000
02:07:50,051 --> 02:07:51,040
What did you think?

2001
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:53,713
You didn't break the
difference between us..

2002
02:07:53,788 --> 02:07:57,121
..and separated a
brother and sister.

2003
02:08:03,197 --> 02:08:04,664
And, Boman, you.

2004
02:08:06,868 --> 02:08:08,665
This boy's hot.

2005
02:08:08,736 --> 02:08:11,204
Make me your partner.

2006
02:08:17,678 --> 02:08:18,940
And what did you think?

2007
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:23,610
You can ruin us posing
as Ghanta Singh. - No.

2008
02:08:29,090 --> 02:08:30,614
Good shot, Kabir.

2009
02:08:44,772 --> 02:08:46,831
What?
- BaIIs to me.

2010
02:09:01,989 --> 02:09:04,924
First we duped you of 250 crores.

2011
02:09:05,793 --> 02:09:08,125
And now 1000 crores.

2012
02:09:08,930 --> 02:09:10,454
But just a minute.

2013
02:09:10,865 --> 02:09:13,134
We have those 1000 crores.

2014
02:09:13,134 --> 02:09:16,001
And we wiII never teII you
where we have hidden it.

2015
02:09:16,070 --> 02:09:17,935
What now? What now? What now?

2016
02:09:18,005 --> 02:09:21,202
Who wiII teII us now
where are the 1000 crores.

2017
02:09:21,275 --> 02:09:22,537
I wiII.

2018
02:09:29,217 --> 02:09:30,741
Mausim bhai, you are aIive.

2019
02:09:30,818 --> 02:09:33,810
No matter how iII
one wishes for me..

2020
02:09:33,888 --> 02:09:37,551
..but my fate's aIready
decided by Kabir boss.

2021
02:09:37,692 --> 02:09:39,091
Kabir boss?

2022
02:09:39,227 --> 02:09:42,563
The one that brought
you to India from Macau.

2023
02:09:42,563 --> 02:09:44,087
Are us.

2024
02:09:45,032 --> 02:09:49,093
The one that kept an eye on
your every move, every pIanning.

2025
02:09:49,170 --> 02:09:50,637
Are us.

2026
02:09:51,973 --> 02:09:55,909
The 1000 crores that you
hid in Rodex dockyard.

2027
02:09:57,979 --> 02:10:00,846
The one that transferred it
to Kabir Naik's Swiss account.

2028
02:10:00,915 --> 02:10:01,973
Are us.

2029
02:10:04,919 --> 02:10:06,045
So?

2030
02:10:06,721 --> 02:10:09,246
Surprised, aren't you?

2031
02:10:09,790 --> 02:10:11,121
Traitor.

2032
02:10:11,192 --> 02:10:13,183
You were supporting
them aII the time.

2033
02:10:15,530 --> 02:10:16,929
On that note I remembered.

2034
02:10:17,665 --> 02:10:20,133
When someone's going
through a bad phase.

2035
02:10:20,735 --> 02:10:22,600
He doesn't need a watch.

2036
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:24,132
Leave the watch, rascaI.

2037
02:10:24,205 --> 02:10:26,264
We have Iost the money,
at Ieast Ieave the watch.

2038
02:10:26,541 --> 02:10:29,066
But, Kabir, why us?

2039
02:10:29,944 --> 02:10:31,673
It was your fauIt.

2040
02:10:32,079 --> 02:10:33,808
I warned you so many times..

2041
02:10:33,881 --> 02:10:35,940
..that don't come to my home,
don't come to my home.

2042
02:10:36,083 --> 02:10:37,550
I wiII make you pay.

2043
02:10:37,618 --> 02:10:38,880
But you..

2044
02:10:38,953 --> 02:10:42,548
Kabir. Kabir. Kabir. Kabir.

2045
02:10:42,890 --> 02:10:44,482
Now you are paying for it.

2046
02:10:44,559 --> 02:10:46,026
First Bata bhai.

2047
02:10:46,093 --> 02:10:49,756
And not Johnny BonzeIa.
- BonzeIa?

2048
02:10:49,897 --> 02:10:54,163
Yes, you invited your own death.

2049
02:10:54,635 --> 02:10:55,966
He must be on his way.

2050
02:10:56,103 --> 02:10:59,561
And after this, we
wiII show him your fiIm..

2051
02:10:59,640 --> 02:11:01,642
..in this red Iounge.

2052
02:11:01,642 --> 02:11:06,045
And then he wiII make
smaII pieces of your body.

2053
02:11:47,088 --> 02:11:48,817
Brother, what's wrong with them?

2054
02:11:49,156 --> 02:11:50,817
When someone's scared..

2055
02:11:51,092 --> 02:11:53,822
..they start
speaking in every Ianguage.

2056
02:11:54,095 --> 02:11:56,086
Isn't it?
- Yes.

2057
02:11:56,564 --> 02:11:58,156
Kabir boss.

2058
02:11:58,232 --> 02:12:00,700
Forgive us.

2059
02:12:01,836 --> 02:12:03,497
Cops and thieves are brothers.

2060
02:12:03,571 --> 02:12:04,765
We were friends.

2061
02:12:04,972 --> 02:12:06,974
We were once partners.

2062
02:12:06,974 --> 02:12:08,965
