00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,510
<font color="#00ffff">It's hard to lose anger</font>

138
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,780
<font color="#00ffff">It's everything because of it. We are generations
The sacrifice you destroyed was destroyed</font>

139
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:49,880
<font color="#00ffff">So, on the Mujahidea day, you're a naked sacrifice
You have to do it
I can not</font>

140
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,520
<font color="#00ffff">He's already there. What else to do?
Cut their legs</font>

141
00:30:56,730 --> 00:31:00,060
<font color="#00ffff">This girl is our newest day
Please stay in the temple</font>

142
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,090
<font color="#00ffff">Is he stupid? Who is the fool?</font>

143
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,090
<font color="#00ffff">Grab</font>

144
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,530
<font color="#00ffff">Leave me. Hold that girl</font>

145
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,440
<font color="#00ffff">You came to rescue me
Your men ran</font>

146
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,710
<font color="#00ffff">This group came</font>

147
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,040
<font color="#00ffff">Stop the car</font>

148
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,660
<font color="#00ffff">First the dagger was raised. Then for the girl
The gunman was shot. Now leave the girl
Who is he?</font>

149
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,880
<font color="#00ffff">Let's get it</font>

150
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,430
<font color="#00ffff">It's gone, Anachchi</font>

151
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,820
<font color="#00ffff">So far, where have you been?
Speak?</font>

152
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,140
<font color="#00ffff">I was scared when I put your strap on your picture</font>

153
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:55,750
<font color="#00ffff">It's my father
You thought</font>

154
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:01,780
<font color="#00ffff">I heard that you were banned for six months
Leave it off. This is twice a year</font>

155
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,330
<font color="#00ffff">I asked for a favor from you
Somebody cheated me</font>

156
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,490
<font color="#00ffff">What do you say?</font>

157
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:36,920
<font color="#00ffff">Get out of the car? Your boyfriend
Because I paid you this, I will not even touch you</font>

158
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,640
<font color="#00ffff">Now, my car and my car were taken care of</font>

159
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,860
<font color="#00ffff">The seat is hot</font>

160
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,990
<font color="#00ffff">My father did not go anywhere
This car is in the car</font>

161
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:52,660
<font color="#00ffff">So is Mom in the mood?
Wait a minute</font>

162
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,120
<font color="#00ffff">Who is sleeping in the streets and doing the Yoga?
There was a seizure</font>

163
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,650
<font color="#00ffff">The key to this is right
Give it a key, this doll?</font>

164
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,510
<font color="#00ffff">Oh, you ...
Call an ambulance</font>

165
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:14,190
<font color="#00ffff">Call</font>

00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,730
<font color="#00ffff">Let's get it from our car</font>

168
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,920
<font color="#00ffff">This is our father's death
If he's dead in the car, too</font>

169
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,440
<font color="#00ffff">I have this car already
Call and call</font>

170

172
00:34:56,770 --> 00:35:00,820
<font color="#00ffff">do not be afraid. If the flowers went down the road
Find him</font>

173
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,780
<font color="#00ffff">The ambulance went 10 minutes
There is no exit here</font>

174
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,340
<font color="#00ffff">I showed a snooze
Show you a phocus light</font>

175
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:34,070
<font color="#00ffff">It's only days till my father's final writing ends
It's 2. It's not good to make any bad luck anymore</font>

176
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,480
<font color="#00ffff">At the moment, I'll put a Syrian set</font>

177
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:45,860
<font color="#00ffff">Are these jokes? Now I'll tell the real story</font>

178
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:51,300
<font color="#00ffff">So I studied for 8 years. My friend
On the beach</font>

179
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,380
<font color="#00ffff">Can we play games?
What game?</font>

180
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,650
<font color="#00ffff">First, go swimming in the bath</font>

181
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,370
<font color="#00ffff">I'm back</font>

182
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:13,780
<font color="#00ffff">Where's the cloth? Where did everyone go?</font>

183
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:36,520
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you coming with a undergarment?
Give your cloak some?</font>

184
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,070
<font color="#00ffff">Who's my mom answering?
Can not give. Going</font>

185
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:43,580
<font color="#00ffff">I did not get your cloth. It's the boat
It's gone
What boat?</font>

186
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:47,730
<font color="#00ffff">You were seated and smoked a cigarette</font>

187
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:59,220
<font color="#00ffff">I became a cop in a great man
Being an engineer and becoming a Gurkha is yours
If not imprisoned, my name is Mylvom</font>

188
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,710
<font color="#00ffff">Is there anybody here?</font>

189
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,970
<font color="#00ffff">By the time my two kids die
Do not forget</font>

190
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:22,340
<font color="#00ffff">If not revenge, my name
Miley's not</font>

191
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:00,630
<font color="#00ffff">What do you mean? Everything is fast
Are you coming to Pub every night?</font>

192
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,750
<font color="#00ffff">You're quick for everything</font>

193
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,290
<font color="#00ffff">Get caught up in the police
Hide somewhere</font>

194
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,510
<font color="#00ffff">What's this? Still hanging in there?</font>

195
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:43,480
<font color="#00ffff">Leave it off. Now save my capital
Give your sari</font>

196
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:48,420
<font color="#00ffff">You take the car. She's crazy
We're out</font>

197
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,110
<font color="#00ffff">The police went. Come on
Leave?</font>

198
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:57,210
<font color="#00ffff">Where's my clothes? The iPad</font>

199
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,710
<font color="#00ffff">Ring? the clock ? Necklace</font>

200
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,090
<font color="#00ffff">It got closer and just went</font>

201
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:14,350
<font color="#00ffff">If the three of you did not get revenge
My name is Mylvom</font>

202
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,790
<font color="#00ffff">Because the car stopped?
It's the train at the train station</font>

203
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,470
<font color="#00ffff">Are you petrol or not?
1000</font>

204
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,630
<font color="#00ffff">Where? Put it in here
The tank was full</font>

205
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,190
<font color="#00ffff">You hit a mosquito?

206
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,450

The car stopped</font>

00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:48,220
<font color="#00ffff">Ship's a bus? Stay where you are

<font color="#00ffff">Why are you wearing underwear? From Gemini Studio?
Have you come so far? Who are you?</font>

211
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,400
<font color="#00ffff">I'm a thief</font>

212
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,270
<font color="#00ffff">Look at this. I do not have anything except the dress
That's not enough. Get me out</font>

220
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,930
<font color="#00ffff">An skull is not an Emblem
So, golden?</font>

221

<font color="#00ffff">First, there are 4 statues. There's a box down there

244
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:45,150
<font color="#00ffff">That's not it. Are you kiddies? it's difficult
Even Naguma can not be raised</font>

245

Are you suspicious? No doubt. Will</font>

274
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,980
<font color="#00ffff">Why did you do this? This is a big risk of the forest
There.</font>

Suddenly, she is going to give blood. Do not block this</font>

282
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:07,220
<font color="#00ffff">It's not a waste of a bullet
Get off the ground
Just say a little</font>

283
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:22,420

Do you need anything for money?</font>

00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:07,700
<font color="#00ffff">You think we're gonna be gone? I am her
Not like a patient. Down</font>

<font color="#00ffff">Want the car? It had to be said before</font>

295
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:41,520
<font color="#00ffff">Sinful. You're firing. Me too
Is this what you were told? Down</font>

296
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,320
<font color="#00ffff">What do you say?</font>

297
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:52,820
<font color="#00ffff">No one else has my husband. Take the car
The car is not bigger than his life</font>

298
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,530
<font color="#00ffff">Let's go to the hospital
Sin. My girlfriend said</font>

299
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,340
<font color="#00ffff">This lady is alive, right?
Now, what is the risk of that car?</font>

300
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:20,180
<font color="#00ffff">When you took the box, how many of you did you say?
Rs. 50 lakhs</font>

<font color="#00ffff">to you?</font>

302
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,480
<font color="#00ffff">Tell me why not laugh like mad</font>

303
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,840
<font color="#00ffff">Their plan is that this girl must surrender
They're making a sacrifice. This is calm</font>

304
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,390
<font color="#00ffff">That's when we need to get the box
Is not it?</font>

305
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:41,480
<font color="#00ffff">Then? As the box gets mine
This is the gun you gave me to kill you. Kill</font>

306
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,080
<font color="#00ffff">Wait a minute
Why did they say that?</font>

307
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:46,860

308
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:51,430

This time I was hiding and watching</font>

309
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:56,720
<font color="#00ffff">When I got them in the box
How is it that you will not kill me?
My plan is now</font>

310
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:02,700
<font color="#00ffff">If you help me, what's in that box
Share in 3 sections. Can be stable</font>

311
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:06,740
<font color="#00ffff">If you say, enjoy your life

312
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:13,220
<font color="#00ffff">My time is good. Money. And girls, too
Got it? That's right</font>

<font color="#00ffff">Shoot
Shoot not</font>

319
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,890
<font color="#00ffff">There was no use of guns. There should be bullets</font>

320
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,640
<font color="#00ffff">Bring him to hell</font>

321
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:36,790
<font color="#00ffff">What are you just doing? Come on
The gun fell down. That's why you're looking. I'll take a minute</font>

<font color="#00ffff">Show the gun and tried to get the food and the car
If you do not come back, what will happen to our situation?</font>

328
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:14,870
<font color="#00ffff">We were told that the husband is going to give blood
Now he's calling Malli to eat</font>

He went to jail</font>

404
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:47,130
<font color="#00ffff">I do not like to talk around from God
Every day I saw you in the pub</font>

405
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:53,400
<font color="#00ffff">Actually, I liked this deal, you and me
Because I'm coming with you. Or I'm advancing with Advance</font>

406
01:08:53,670 --> 01:08:59,300
<font color="#00ffff">He does not know English. Take the advance
I've been there a lot of days</font>

407
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:04,510
<font color="#00ffff">You sour sari</font>

408
01:09:04,510 --> 01:09:07,180
<font color="#00ffff">Flowering flowers overhead</font>

409
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,170
<font color="#00ffff">Hand in milk</font>

410
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:13,350
<font color="#00ffff">Cover flowers with flowers</font>

411
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:19,740
<font color="#00ffff">At the same time, to tie the knack
Is it your village?</font>

412
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,360
<font color="#00ffff">It was easy to see</font>

413
01:09:23,370 --> 01:09:30,920
<font color="#00ffff">You're expecting me either
If you do not like this, love you
What do you want from that?</font>

414
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,240
<font color="#00ffff">The first thing is fine
Beat</font>

415
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:42,880
<font color="#00ffff">A jump of a leg
It's not an asshole. It's an ant</font>

416
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:53,230
<font color="#00ffff">Demote. What do you think would happen to Marsha?
He read a book for Masha. Tell me what you think</font>

417
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:58,900
<font color="#00ffff">Along with the mike, everyone in front
Listen. Then I will answer. Leave now</font>

418
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,400
<font color="#00ffff">Will you get Mike here?</font>

419
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:07,570
<font color="#00ffff">There is no Mike in the forest. Get in the car. There
Muniesh left alone</font>

420
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:12,820
<font color="#00ffff">As you can imagine, the village does not easy to go
It's all crazy</font>

421
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:19,380
<font color="#00ffff">That's 3 bubbles. You believe me
I believe him as I do. He's been for years
Stay with me</font>

422
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:25,190
<font color="#00ffff">Whatever happens, we are relatives. He's someone else
That's right. We are going to the new day</font>

423
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:28,700
<font color="#00ffff">That's the dog</font>

424
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:35,740
<font color="#00ffff">Nina and lefty are talking about you
What's happening there?</font>

425
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:42,640
<font color="#00ffff">The girl went to the village. The New Year's poem
Tīndukalā.
Okay. Put the box in your pocket to kill them</font>

426
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,110
<font color="#00ffff">The village has passed by</font>

427
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:55,890
<font color="#00ffff">He said to use the brains. She's all
It's used</font>

428
01:10:56,730 --> 01:11:03,540
<font color="#00ffff">If this were told to me, it would be easier to finish
Does not it look like an actor? Why should I take turns now?</font>

429
01:11:03,880 --> 01:11:08,520
<font color="#00ffff">Actor? Are you? Before you come to me, you
Do you know the former job?</font>

430
01:11:19,890 --> 01:11:23,160
<font color="#00ffff">Why should they think it?
That's what? Does not it look like actors?</font>

431
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:27,320
<font color="#00ffff">Naḷuvo. Oyālatda?
Let's try to hide it back</font>

432
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:32,520
<font color="#00ffff">If I leave this, I will not be able to speak
There's Aya's book. So I do not work
Jump to the sea</font>

433
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:36,500
<font color="#00ffff">I came out early in the morning
Come on, come on. Go back to this</font>

434
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:46,740
<font color="#00ffff">Show you once. See
Why did you take him? Like a guy</font>

435
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:51,620
<font color="#00ffff">You're your stuff
His belly is stinging</font>

436
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:54,310
<font color="#00ffff">We're screaming. He's lost her</font>

437
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:59,900
<font color="#00ffff">He will kill the treacherous of this monk</font>

438
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,280
<font color="#00ffff">It's not the music</font>

439
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:35,830
<font color="#00ffff">This is a song against our nation
I've been singing songs to please you</font>

440
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:40,830
<font color="#00ffff">I'll show you a song
do not. Ask me when I say so. I have a headache</font>

441
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:45,880
<font color="#00ffff">Is she nervous? This is for me
I'll sing a song. If you sing, you lose the sickness</font>

442
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:01,550
<font color="#00ffff">Headache hit
Leave?</font>

443
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:08,340
<font color="#00ffff">Tomorrow we will be given a treasure trove
I did not say goodbye</font>

444
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:10,080
<font color="#00ffff">Say what you're doing</font>

445
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:16,960
<font color="#00ffff">When it comes to treasure, stay in this world
All the thieves are loaded</font>

446
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:21,950
<font color="#00ffff">Will they come all the way and steal?
Well</font>

447
01:13:25,570 --> 01:13:31,310
<font color="#00ffff">You look bigger than us
We will rob the future in the future</font>

448
01:13:31,310 --> 01:13:36,100
<font color="#00ffff">Whoever you are, if anyone wants to hear anything
not. You're single</font>

449
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,970
<font color="#00ffff">That's what? So why do not you like this?</font>

450
01:13:40,730 --> 01:13:42,930
<font color="#00ffff">Who said there was no one?</font>

451
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:49,770
<font color="#00ffff">Trusting me and having a team
What do you say?</font>

452
01:13:51,830 --> 01:13:53,770
<font color="#00ffff">I'm doing an orphanage</font>

453
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:03,700
<font color="#00ffff">The children there are all of my relatives</font>

454
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:10,260
<font color="#00ffff">You say ...</font>

455
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:15,490
<font color="#00ffff">Yes. I'm robbing them</font>

456
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:23,710
<font color="#00ffff">My car sounds silent, the kids are coming</font>

457
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:42,990
<font color="#00ffff">The love I show to the children when I'm there
I can not say words</font>

458
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,600
<font color="#00ffff">After me, they have no one</font>

459
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:54,340
<font color="#00ffff">I'm alive trying to add them a lot of money
Would like to have</font>

460
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:58,710
<font color="#00ffff">I can not go after these help</font>

461
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:04,080
<font color="#00ffff">That is why I am trying to do this work</font>

462
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:11,960
<font color="#00ffff">Those children ...
The Masha. So much for you ...</font>

463
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:18,620
<font color="#00ffff">He is the Archbishop. You tell me</font>

464
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:23,440
<font color="#00ffff">He is lying. You believe too</font>

465
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:27,800
<font color="#00ffff">He believes what he says
Why are you losing?</font>

466
01:15:29,190 --> 01:15:30,890
<font color="#00ffff">Yes</font>

467
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:35,410
<font color="#00ffff">They live there</font>

468
01:15:39,530 --> 01:15:45,550
<font color="#00ffff">Are all the lies? When I considered you
Thinking like a mother</font>

469
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:06,750
<font color="#00ffff">What happened, Muniz?</font>

470
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:15,070
<font color="#00ffff">After my mother died, I loved
Very sad</font>

471
01:16:17,130 --> 01:16:18,940
<font color="#00ffff">Now that sadness is lost</font>

472
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:27,880
<font color="#00ffff">Our is more than the treasure we ought to receive
This family is a treasure trove</font>

473
01:16:28,330 --> 01:16:32,250
<font color="#00ffff">You get more of it
Saying this?</font>

474
01:16:33,860 --> 01:16:35,760
<font color="#00ffff">If you want my part, you can take it</font>

475
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:40,120
<font color="#00ffff">Is that brother-in-law?</font>

476
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:13,920
<font color="#00ffff">If I come in and hide, find me
Can not? It's killing you today
Do not kill your brother</font>

477
01:17:15,270 --> 01:17:21,020
<font color="#00ffff">Do not fire, brother. I'll give it to Phil
Do not shoot</font>

478
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:59,460
<font color="#00ffff">Do not shoot your brother</font>

479
01:22:01,030 --> 01:22:08,300
<font color="#00ffff">Everyone listen. Afternoon, this girl
A naked sacrifice at our Clubogavali temple
It will walk around the village</font>

480
01:22:18,580 --> 01:22:26,280
<font color="#00ffff">This way to come this way? That's you, me
Full of you? I'll see you today</font>

481
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:43,740
<font color="#00ffff">Want to dig treasure?
Can not put it in the trees?</font>

482
01:22:51,030 --> 01:22:52,440
<font color="#00ffff">Come on</font>

483
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:01,650
<font color="#00ffff">Rævaṭunānē</font>

484
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:08,890
<font color="#00ffff">They're doing something</font>

485
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:15,270
<font color="#00ffff">Better yet another person
May I have Panchayit's leader?</font>

486
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:18,180
<font color="#00ffff">Should she ask for part 5?
Dig</font>

487
01:23:18,180 --> 01:23:25,920
<font color="#00ffff">Already, Ma'chala has come up with four sections</font>

488
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:31,870
<font color="#00ffff">Come on, Ma'asha. You are talking about
What are these speeches?</font>

489
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:38,150
<font color="#00ffff">Part? Your father's homeowner's property
Talk like that. Can I have this? Do the job</font>

490
01:23:38,150 --> 01:23:42,810
<font color="#00ffff">Keep your mouth shut</font>

491
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:52,420
<font color="#00ffff">What theft here? Who are you
Hypocrites</font>

492
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:03,310
<font color="#00ffff">Stop your dancing. Your mansion is out</font>

493
01:24:03,610 --> 01:24:10,480
<font color="#00ffff">Would you marry then?
Did you ask me to have a naked sacrifice? Stay
Now I'll tell the people</font>

494
01:24:10,910 --> 01:24:14,020
<font color="#00ffff">Bring water for a second
You want anything?</font>

495
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:20,040
<font color="#00ffff">Take it
Go and drive</font>

496
01:24:25,820 --> 01:24:27,940
<font color="#00ffff">What happened to you? Did you sleep?</font>

497
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:38,150
<font color="#00ffff">Is there a musical exposition here? How
Run on?</font>

498
01:24:38,150 --> 01:24:43,490
<font color="#00ffff">Angry is not connected
How much effort would you have to marse Marsha?</font>

499
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:02,630
<font color="#00ffff">What is the big risk? 3 parts</font>

500
01:26:03,650 --> 01:26:08,650
<font color="#00ffff">Four parts. Right on the side of the car
Stop</font>

501
01:26:08,660 --> 01:26:12,490
<font color="#00ffff">Let's see what's in the box
Let's go home</font>

502
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:15,880
<font color="#00ffff">And what's in it, what's in it?
Let's go to Masha's house</font>

503
01:26:19,280 --> 01:26:23,050
<font color="#00ffff">Get the guy who said to pick up the car
Let's give him the box</font>

504
01:26:23,820 --> 01:26:28,670
<font color="#00ffff">Are you from the secret police?
What are we crazy about?</font>

505
01:26:28,670 --> 01:26:33,340
<font color="#00ffff">I do not know them. Get the car there
I said I'd deliver the box</font>

506
01:26:34,110 --> 01:26:37,430
<font color="#00ffff">Can you give them so good?
They do not know. The car ...</font>

507
01:26:57,070 --> 01:26:59,580
<font color="#00ffff">Why did you do this? What happened?</font>

508
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
<font color="#00ffff">This is home rentals. These are school fees
No one else except my sister</font>

509
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:22,790
<font color="#00ffff">Try to develop and develop it
Wrong arts</font>

510
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:34,700
<font color="#00ffff">Swear about who he is
I do not know. Leave us</font>

511
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:39,870
<font color="#00ffff">We told you to take the nurse away
Or both can not go alive</font>

512
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:44,500
<font color="#00ffff">I'm afraid, sister. Get me out of here</font>

513
01:27:44,860 --> 01:27:48,640
<font color="#00ffff">Right
The one coming with you is not good enough to know about this</font>

514
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:59,010
<font color="#00ffff">Give this box. I want my sister</font>

515
01:28:09,870 --> 01:28:13,150
<font color="#00ffff">About her sister and without a conscience
Why is it?</font>

516
01:28:13,150 --> 01:28:21,310
<font color="#00ffff">I have a conscience too. She
I'll take care of what's in this box before I give in</font>

517
01:28:50,060 --> 01:28:55,380
<font color="#00ffff">Put that box in 3 pieces
Can not be stable in life
I've had a good time</font>

518
01:28:55,380 --> 01:28:59,640
<font color="#00ffff">Let's bring every thief to a meal</font>

519
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:22,020
<font color="#00ffff">Get</font>

520
01:30:06,640 --> 01:30:09,200
<font color="#00ffff">If you showed the lights in 4 more vehicles
Scared</font>

521
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:13,810
<font color="#00ffff">At the fighter jet they could have been captured</font>

522
01:30:13,810 --> 01:30:18,950
<font color="#00ffff">Your intelligence is your father
The cemetery is the one to write</font>

<font color="#00ffff">get up</font>

<font color="#00ffff">What?</font>

527
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,720
<font color="#00ffff">It's like Anjavachy's vehicle</font>

528
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:30,120
<font color="#00ffff">The phone wakes up inside
Listen to these fools</font>

529
01:31:30,120 --> 01:31:34,600
<font color="#00ffff">hear. Sounds good
Should've been taken? Am I supposed to?</font>

530
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:40,620
<font color="#00ffff">Call me if anyone calls right now
Bad news. Good news if you take it
That's what you had to do</font>

531
01:31:42,030 --> 01:31:46,000
<font color="#00ffff">We found our car
Did you get the car?</font>

532
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:51,330
<font color="#00ffff">It's on the Katur road. That woman's inside it</font>

533
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:58,120
<font color="#00ffff">You hit the car in the car. The car's going
Come on. Call our mailservations</font>

534
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:21,610
<font color="#00ffff">We come in front
The car's there.
Well, they did not know me at good times</font>

535
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,350
<font color="#00ffff">Wait. What's up? What are you looking at?</font>

536
01:32:31,750 --> 01:32:36,410
<font color="#00ffff">My father did not go anywhere. These cars
It's there
So is Mom in the mood?</font>

537
01:32:38,290 --> 01:32:43,430
<font color="#00ffff">Really, you're a fucking mother, dick
My mother? What do you mean, nonsense?</font>

538
01:32:43,430 --> 01:32:49,180
<font color="#00ffff">Stay out there
Yes. Not false. If you want, come and see</font>

539
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:13,990
<font color="#00ffff">Are you here? Where's my car?
How many people leave this way?</font>

540
01:33:15,490 --> 01:33:19,880
<font color="#00ffff">Have you seen your father? Sinful. Still acting?</font>

541
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:22,970
<font color="#00ffff">Talk with her and with this woman
Hang on</font>

542
01:33:31,510 --> 01:33:33,910
<font color="#00ffff">Is everything here?</font>

543
01:33:34,720 --> 01:33:37,970
<font color="#00ffff">Sinner. Are you here?</font>

544
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:45,850
<font color="#00ffff">How?
I'm turning my head. Every swindler in the world
Feels like seen</font>

545
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:54,370
<font color="#00ffff">Who is he?</font>

546
01:33:56,130 --> 01:34:00,580
<font color="#00ffff">Are you balding? Sinner. Are not hair yet?</font>

547
01:34:00,750 --> 01:34:04,370
<font color="#00ffff">Kākāvalippuva. You're the leader?</font>

548
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:09,510
<font color="#00ffff">My dad's cars did not know who I am
Did you stole it?</font>

549
01:34:10,260 --> 01:34:13,420
<font color="#00ffff">Wait. You've been taken with beardman
I'll get together with the bales</font>

550
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:17,290
<font color="#00ffff">Take me with you. I have a vault</font>

551
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,640
<font color="#00ffff">Please get down. I did not know who I was
Playing</font>

552
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:26,240
<font color="#00ffff">Who are you talking to?</font>

553
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:31,300
<font color="#00ffff">What's going on loud?</font>

554
01:34:31,980 --> 01:34:34,970
<font color="#00ffff">When we come to know who he is
You?</font>

555
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:43,530
<font color="#00ffff">When she was born, Mother's life was revived. Royal College
Learned. Grandpa's tart was trampled</font>

556
01:34:43,530 --> 01:34:49,420
<font color="#00ffff">He was taken to the ground and buried.
Girl in 10th year, delicious. Her
Take over your mother</font>

557
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:54,060
<font color="#00ffff">When he put up, he drank the battery
It caused me to throat Barandivana</font>

558
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:58,330
<font color="#00ffff">Your dad took the gift car
Hit. The policeman who came to hear it was attacked</font>

559
01:34:58,330 --> 01:35:00,960
<font color="#00ffff">So I was sentenced to prison. You smoked</font>

560
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:07,940
<font color="#00ffff">Come out and make your place. Again
A girl is delicious. Gave him a baby for his stomach
At last, Father was set on fire</font>

561
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:18,550
<font color="#00ffff">How do you know that?</font>

562
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:23,650
<font color="#00ffff">This gift has been given to your father
This is also the girl</font>

563
01:35:24,800 --> 01:35:27,410
<font color="#00ffff">He might be taking this car
What's wrong?</font>

564
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:38,080
<font color="#00ffff">Your name?
He's the real snake. Like your mother's sister</font>

565
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:41,050
<font color="#00ffff">Small. Forgive me
Okay</font>

566
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:49,850
<font color="#00ffff">I am a sinner. You did not know who you were
Where did all this go? What were you doing?
Why did not you come to see us?</font>

567
01:35:49,850 --> 01:35:55,250
<font color="#00ffff">I'm doing an orphanage
He started to lie</font>

568
01:35:55,250 --> 01:36:01,540
<font color="#00ffff">They are the same kindergartens
ID? It's very hungry Mother</font>

569
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:09,320
<font color="#00ffff">Without knowing this, I was wrong about you
You're a great person. Let's go home</font>

570
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:15,410
<font color="#00ffff">Leave it in little. Your mother is here
see</font>

571
01:36:20,490 --> 01:36:22,880
<font color="#00ffff">Look at this. It's your mother</font>

572
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:30,060
<font color="#00ffff">Your father loved her mother very much
He could not bury him after his death</font>

573
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,840
<font color="#00ffff">So I could not help but look in the car</font>

574
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:40,600
<font color="#00ffff">You saw it and you do not feel well
You did not give the car. That is why it was a lie
I took the car</font>

575
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:44,110
<font color="#00ffff">See if you look at your chest</font>

576
01:36:44,110 --> 01:36:48,210
<font color="#00ffff">I have not seen my mom in a picture</font>

577
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:52,100
<font color="#00ffff">Mother. This was a long time for you
I did not see it</font>

578
01:37:11,020 --> 01:37:14,300
<font color="#00ffff">My father is a bitch. A word from me
Not really</font>

579
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,060
<font color="#00ffff">She took the mother and took the gauze</font>

580
01:37:24,060 --> 01:37:27,280
<font color="#00ffff">Although. It was too small for our father
It's something</font>

581
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:42,220
<font color="#00ffff">Whatever you say, yes
False beliefs you said. How?</font>

582
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:47,450
<font color="#00ffff">In his diary in that car, his
Daddy's writing about him</font>

583
01:37:47,450 --> 01:37:52,310
<font color="#00ffff">Sinner. This is a story
Like I read?</font>

584
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:03,950
<font color="#00ffff">What happened? If she leaves empty-handed, will her sister be neutral?</font>

585
01:38:04,790 --> 01:38:07,130
<font color="#00ffff">Would you like to go with your human skeletons?</font>

586
01:38:07,130 --> 01:38:13,040
<font color="#00ffff">Do not play. That's what's in that box
Okay. They asked for us the box. We do not have it</font>

587
01:38:13,570 --> 01:38:18,370
<font color="#00ffff">Someone's stealing. My daughter-in-law
Is it not for stealing for this?</font>

588
01:38:18,370 --> 01:38:21,950
<font color="#00ffff">Niece? He does not know English
Tell her</font>

589
01:38:21,950 --> 01:38:25,810
<font color="#00ffff">Sister
sister in law.
He is</font>

590
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:31,810
<font color="#00ffff">How? Trust me. Tomorrow is yours
Sister, we eat ice creams with the 4</font>

591
01:38:32,770 --> 01:38:40,580
<font color="#00ffff">You three of them went into a fight and took the girl
Come on. I will make goat's goat's soup</font>

592
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:51,730
<font color="#00ffff">Why did not they give evidence that the priest is coming home?
Can not you call out to the village? Who are you, who are we?
Previously on the box opened and said?</font>

593
01:38:53,940 --> 01:38:57,200
<font color="#00ffff">Give me my dad. I'm leaving
Wait just wait</font>

594
01:38:57,620 --> 01:39:04,010
<font color="#00ffff">Who knows who will suddenly change the sacred day?
There was a man in Haradinaj's box. There was a fight there
The box is off</font>

595
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:07,580
<font color="#00ffff">Would you mind if the bones were golden?</font>

596
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:12,250
<font color="#00ffff">Do you really have nuts? Where's the treasure?</font>

597
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:16,230
<font color="#00ffff">As you said they went to the village. My sister
Leave. Where is she?</font>

598
01:39:16,820 --> 01:39:20,670
<font color="#00ffff">What's going on here? Wait just wait
Your sister did not go anywhere</font>

599
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:25,530
<font color="#00ffff">Is there a talk? Wait just wait
Where is my sister? What did you do?</font>

600
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:37,730
<font color="#00ffff">What are you doing to anyone?</font>

601
01:41:40,230 --> 01:41:44,270
<font color="#00ffff">They're very upset
Sit down your leg</font>

602
01:41:44,270 --> 01:41:47,550
<font color="#00ffff">Getting out of sins is what I do more than that</font>

603
01:41:49,450 --> 01:41:54,970
<font color="#00ffff">That's what bones need
Not only the bones and the box.
Come and bring</font>

604
01:41:55,850 --> 01:41:59,780
<font color="#00ffff">Don said. Come on
Do you want to tell me separately? Coming</font>

605
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:05,930
<font color="#00ffff">She's just here just gone. He is the one who gave those bones
Take her away</font>

606
01:42:06,090 --> 01:42:11,500
<font color="#00ffff">This is a ninja, if there's anything wrong with this
It's bone</font>

607
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,500
<font color="#00ffff">Save us</font>

608
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:27,020
<font color="#00ffff">You have love. Tell me what to do</font>

609
01:42:38,860 --> 01:42:42,590
<font color="#00ffff">I'm suspicious of them. We also had to go</font>

610
01:42:43,160 --> 01:42:48,910
<font color="#00ffff">My suspicion is your grandfather
Someone who died as a treasure is buried</font>

611
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:52,080
<font color="#00ffff">Your daddy got messed up and messed up</font>

612
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:03,930
<font color="#00ffff">Why did you fire?</font>

613
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,970
<font color="#00ffff">One of my grandfather's taught lessons</font>

614
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:26,490
<font color="#00ffff">She made bones of elephants and hid the diamond in her
The temple was buried in the wall</font>

615
01:43:26,890 --> 01:43:31,780
<font color="#00ffff">What do you see anyone look at?
Bones</font>

616
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:35,760
<font color="#00ffff">Tell me now. Who the fool?</font>

617
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:42,690
<font color="#00ffff">Your grandfather is a big cripple. First of all
It's just sad</font>

618
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:46,460
<font color="#00ffff">Did not hide. I thought to tell you when I was in the office</font>

619
01:43:49,930 --> 01:43:56,370
<font color="#00ffff">What do you say? So much for a bone?</font>

620
01:43:56,770 --> 01:44:01,540
<font color="#00ffff">Can it be a bone?
Is it really his mother?</font>

621
01:44:01,540 --> 01:44:06,180
<font color="#00ffff">That's not the bone. There's something inside that box</font>

622
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:11,480
<font color="#00ffff">There is nothing other than a bone in that box
But the box is heavy</font>

623
01:44:11,480 --> 01:44:17,220
<font color="#00ffff">Two of them came to the postmortem. Their lives
Are your boxes bigger than yours?</font>

624
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:22,360
<font color="#00ffff">What's this say? Then why cart
Talking about bones? Departure,</font>

625
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:25,580
<font color="#00ffff">To get the bone from his bone</font>

626
01:44:26,680 --> 01:44:30,720
<font color="#00ffff">What's that nose with the bone?
Do not know</font>

627
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:09,320
<font color="#00ffff">That's silly for my mom
Look beautiful</font>

628
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:14,320
<font color="#00ffff">Not your mother, my sari is pretty
This makes my mother so ugly</font>

629
01:45:14,360 --> 01:45:18,190
<font color="#00ffff">That's somebody's dad. Get it upstairs</font>

630
01:45:18,190 --> 01:45:22,390
<font color="#00ffff">Grandma does not say that. The TVs are devils
Look at the movies</font>

631
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:25,300
<font color="#00ffff">Whatever you say, this is yours
Grandmother</font>

632
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:31,270
<font color="#00ffff">Misty, kids are scared? That's for the grave
Can you cook a sauce and go to the dogs?</font>

633
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:36,590
<font color="#00ffff">Before I see you tell me to make soups</font>

634
01:45:39,180 --> 01:45:46,830
<font color="#00ffff">They torture you while they're alive
Is he tortured later? Are not you coming up?</font>

635
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:09,970
<font color="#00ffff">Come to my house</font>

636
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:16,380
<font color="#00ffff">Did not go away? What are you drinking?
The sixth is the coffee? Or soup?</font>

637
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:20,630
<font color="#00ffff">He'll be put in a lit under steam
Go in</font>

638
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:26,960
<font color="#00ffff">There is no time. If I give Mother, I'm going
You want to give Mum?</font>

639
01:46:27,220 --> 01:46:29,330
<font color="#00ffff">Why are you small? Where are you taking?</font>

640
01:46:29,330 --> 01:46:33,860
<font color="#00ffff">Your father and I have a normal church</font>

641
01:46:33,860 --> 01:46:40,480
<font color="#00ffff">I'll be right back
Your dad did not die for a year
Do you want to go to the temple?</font>

642
01:46:40,480 --> 01:46:47,740
<font color="#00ffff">Yeah, right? That's my father's three
I'm just getting used to it</font>

643
01:46:47,740 --> 01:46:52,740
<font color="#00ffff">Every Aythamily goes to the temple and the family is fine
Sacrifice</font>

644
01:46:52,770 --> 01:46:56,840
<font color="#00ffff">Offering? I'll be right back</font>

645
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:01,030
<font color="#00ffff">Is my fat boy right? Do not be stubborn
We'll go</font>

646
01:47:01,240 --> 01:47:05,410
<font color="#00ffff">I'll be a little too. Or the mother
Do not give</font>

647
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:10,730
<font color="#00ffff">Do not you listen to me? When it's little
Are you stubborn?</font>

648
01:47:13,380 --> 01:47:19,780
<font color="#00ffff">How lovely This attack
I was so excited. Mother stood up and beat up</font>

649
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:25,140
<font color="#00ffff">You take Mama away
Get Mom in the box
Do not touch the little</font>

650
01:47:26,390 --> 01:47:28,730
<font color="#00ffff">Mother was cleaned up and daddy
Get in the car</font>

651
01:47:34,360 --> 01:47:36,890
<font color="#00ffff">I'll be back</font>

653
01:48:00,680 --> 01:48:03,580
<font color="#00ffff">Nice.
Are you?</font>

654
01:48:03,580 --> 01:48:07,100
<font color="#00ffff">Come here, Maile
Come on, Ananthia</font>

655
01:48:11,540 --> 01:48:17,410
<font color="#00ffff">Do you know what deceit is?
Waiting for my grandchild to deceive</font>

656
01:48:17,410 --> 01:48:22,530
<font color="#00ffff">Then why is not her name Sopuna?
My little dear sir</font>

657
01:48:22,530 --> 01:48:26,560
<font color="#00ffff">Your little sacrificial plate has been forgotten</font>

658
01:48:27,350 --> 01:48:31,160
<font color="#00ffff">There will not be a sacrifice
God has given us a chance</font>

<font color="#00ffff">My little Abhaya Veľala Temple
Let's swear. But a condition</font>
