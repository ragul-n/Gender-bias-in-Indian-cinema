1
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,920
(Soft chanting of prayers)

2
00:02:52,438 --> 00:02:53,837
God, please protect us!

3
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:01,614
Oh Lord!

4
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,292
Come!

5
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:48,854
Here.
Have it.

6
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,468
Dude!

7
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,315
Have it!

8
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:47,852
No.
- Oh! Like that, huh?

9
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:50,322
Hey!

10
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,068
Grandpa!

11
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:04,536
Grandpa!

12
00:05:14,013 --> 00:05:14,980
Grandpa!

13
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,450
Grandpa!

14
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,423
Grandpa!

15
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,028
Save me!

16
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,705
Oh God!

17
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:48,440
My grandchild's life is spoiled!

18
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,104
Judicial First Class Magistrate Court
Mamalayoor

19
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:41,909
(singing an old Malayalam song)

20
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:52,129
The song went wrong.
You eat..

21
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:55,756
That case is postponed.

22
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:57,301
They are coming today anyway.

23
00:08:58,304 --> 00:09:00,295
Such a huge building.

24
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,768
Come here, man!

25
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,303
Lord Kandakarna!
- My God!

26
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:08,741
0 Goddess of law!

27
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:10,315
Sit down.

28
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,311
To suggest an advocate who's
best to fight our case,

29
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:17,747
Many people said that
only Mani sir can do it.

30
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,057
Not just advocates;

31
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,059
even when Magistrate Sir is stuck;

32
00:09:23,195 --> 00:09:25,665
he just calls 'Mani'..
-Amazing!

33
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:27,724
We..
- From the temple committee, right?

34
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,633
How did you understand?

35
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,306
Hey! You can't bring such
dangerous weapons to the court.

36
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,637
Okay. I'll keep it here.

37
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:37,538
This is the primary elephant
mahout of ourtem ple.

38
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:38,610
Move, Raman.

39
00:09:38,678 --> 00:09:40,839
Something precious
has been stolen.

40
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:41,914
Orto hostthe festival.

41
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:42,982
Theft.

42
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,643
It's definitely theft, sir.

43
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:48,279
The Lord's Holy Jewellery was
stolen, right? - No sir.

44
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,615
Golden sphere?
- Not that.

45
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,955
Five-metal idols, golden articles, silver
lamps, copper, brass & aluminium plates;

46
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,257
Do you want to sell old bottles,
containers or newspapers?

47
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:59,696
Well.. sir...
-Sorry.

48
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,100
Did you lose anything like that?

49
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,692
No. None ofthat.

50
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:03,928
Then what was lost?

51
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:05,833
We lost our God, sir.

52
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,075
The deity of our temple!
- What?

53
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,944
Someone stole our
Pattazhi Lord Kandakarna.

54
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:12,911
Yes sir.

55
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,247
Who will steal the Lord?

56
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:16,908
He was taken away!
- Where?

57
00:10:16,983 --> 00:10:19,076
We checked with the astrologer.

58
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:22,245
The neighbouring temple's committee
took our temple's priest there;

59
00:10:22,321 --> 00:10:23,845
by offering him a hiked salary.

60
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,251
On his way there,

61
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:30,159
the priest took our Kandakarna as well.
I'm sure about it.

62
00:10:30,229 --> 00:10:33,858
To go with him as soon as he calls, Kandakarna
& the priest were classmates or what?

63
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,729
No. Not that.

64
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:37,697
Oh Lord!

65
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,673
Do you have a one Rupee coin with you?
- No.

66
00:10:42,742 --> 00:10:44,334
Raman, do you have?

67
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,911
One Rupee, right?
No.

68
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:47,902
Is it to keep along with the reward?
- Yes sir.

69
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,214
I'll give it then.

70
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,078
Thank you sir.
- Keep this.

71
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,253
l'm relieved.

72
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,188
Give it here.

73
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,851
So, accept this;

74
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,962
and suggest an advocate who
can bring back our Lord.

75
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:08,327
Here. Keep this.

76
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:10,902
Oh Lord!

77
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,733
An old betel-nut and
my one Rupee coin.

78
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:15,907
An advocate for your case!
- Yes.

79
00:11:27,153 --> 00:11:29,280
My client, against whom
a case is registered

80
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:33,154
under Section 185 of Indian
Motor-vehicle Act 1988.

81
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:35,093
Sir!

82
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,798
Sir!

83
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:45,804
Sir!

84
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,109
You learnt it by
heart & came, right?

85
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:51,770
That was in vain. Sit down.
- Get lost!

86
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,676
The coffin has been opened.

87
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,314
Green -2

88
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:00,785
Yellow - 1.

89
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,948
Rocket - 1.

90
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,448
Where did the white one go?

91
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,486
White one?

92
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:11,294
Where?
It's missing.

93
00:12:11,497 --> 00:12:13,124
I haven't taken the
tablet for pressure.

94
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,199
Haven't brought it too.

95
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:15,766
Did you take it?
- No sir.

96
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:18,960
Sir!

97
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:22,074
Present, sir.

98
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,808
Accepted your attendance.
Sit down.

99
00:12:25,945 --> 00:12:29,938
l was trying to put my child
to sleep all night.. So..

100
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:35,353
Keep it.

101
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,513
I haven't taken the tablet
for pressure today.

102
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:41,127
So today, I won't accept cases
that will make me tensed.

103
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,062
Ya right. As if terrorist cases &
murder cases are pled here daily.

104
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,859
Did you pray at the
temple very well?

105
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,102
Tell me, Binu sir.

106
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,101
Sir, the client is present here.

107
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,336
Sumesh.
-Sir.

108
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,878
ST 2118/18

109
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:00,937
SIO Vayalettu Madhavan
Nair, Jayaraj Nair.

110
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:02,878
Isn't that me?
- Step in auspiciously.

111
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,083
Shall I go?
- Of course.

112
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,141
6 months maximum.

113
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,387
Namaste.

114
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,554
Don't lean on that.

115
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:14,086
It's an antique piece.

116
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:16,990
And there's a real dearth
of carpenters in this town.

117
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,757
If you know any carpenters,
you can lean on it.

118
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:20,999
No.

119
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:25,800
I will present nothing but the
truth, before the court.

120
00:13:27,406 --> 00:13:28,373
So,

121
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:32,467
the case is that he drove the car
carelessly under the influence of alcohol.

122
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:35,975
You asked for time to prove othenNise.
- I can prove it, sir.

123
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,046
The one who did drunken driving
near Kandakkadavu Church,

124
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:41,210
was not my client.

125
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,147
Yes. It's true.

126
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,425
Because, my client was at
another place at the same time.

127
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:47,983
I can prove that.
- Sir,

128
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,558
these are all fabricated evidences.
- Binu sir,

129
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,797
do you have to go
to such extremes?

130
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:55,134
Even though the
statement has errors,

131
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:58,467
Prima facie, this sir drove the car
under the influence of alcohol.

132
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,963
Instead of confiscating the
driving licence for one year,

133
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,233
I'll make it six months.

134
00:14:04,243 --> 00:14:07,371
And I'll change the penalty
from 10,000 to 3,000.

135
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,242
Isn't that enough, Advocate Binu?

136
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:15,376
Sir, fine or license being
confiscated is not the issue here.

137
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,149
He is a teacher.

138
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,482
An ideal man for children.

139
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:21,627
And I'm also a functionary
ofthe Clean lndia Mission.

140
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:25,961
So if he gets punished for a crime he
didn't commit, that too a crime like this;

141
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:27,928
my client's future
itself would be ruined.

142
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,001
Go on!

143
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,294
Give me the documents
of that petty case.

144
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:41,412
Sir, the same day when he supposedly
drove carelessly, around the same time;

145
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,952
my client was at Cheerakkadavu which
is 25 kms away. Here's the evidence.

146
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:47,976
He's so smart!

147
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,985
lndian Evidence Act,
Section 11.

148
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,283
Al...

149
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,253
A
..

150
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:54,326
Al Qaeda?

151
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,654
Alu..

152
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:58,897
Allu Arjun!

153
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:03,897
Alubu..
- Halwa?

154
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,238
Isn't that section
something like that, sir?

155
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,673
What is it actually?
- I don't know.

156
00:15:07,673 --> 00:15:09,903
You've come wearing a coat
without knowing anything!

157
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,243
To be at some-place
else actually,

158
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,269
during the time the crime
was supposedly committed;

159
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,973
That section.
- It's not Halwa or Jilebi, man.

160
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:18,342
Alibi..

161
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,417
Alibi..

162
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:21,578
Alibhai..
Mohanlal's movie.

163
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:23,121
This guy!

164
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:34,133
That's the copy ofthe mahassar of a petty
case charged at Cheerakkadavu station,

165
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,363
against my client, for
urinating in public.

166
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,271
Let that be.

167
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,436
I'm asking you directly.

168
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,006
Can't you pay that fine?

169
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,666
Sir, fine is not the issue here.

170
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,011
It's my image.

171
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:46,978
Okay.

172
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,971
Understood.
- Time to leave, huh?

173
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,174
Why are you all getting up?

174
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,077
l have severe back pain
since the past 2 days.

175
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,424
ljust got up to stretch.
You please sit down.

176
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:01,222
This is why I don't sitwhen I come
to the court. I know he'll fool us.

177
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,260
Advocate sir,

178
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:03,992
this is the evidence.

179
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:07,396
A clear evidence that states his presence

180
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,333
at a particular place,
at a particular time.

181
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,537
l'm rejecting this case.

182
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,037
Oh. As you say.

183
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,009
You needn't pay the fine,
and you won't lose your license as well.

184
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:24,182
Happy now?

185
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,650
Thank you sir.

186
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,415
How is he?
-Advocate is awesome.

187
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,122
Hey! Advocate Binu!

188
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:34,559
Justa minute.

189
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,063
This petty case was charged,

190
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:41,658
for urinating at 4.30
PM in the evening,

191
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:45,434
near the premises of Cherakkadavu
St. Augustine School, right?

192
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:47,706
Isn't that right?

193
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,407
Yes.

194
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,442
That means,

195
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,243
in front of a girls only school where
both major and minor girls are studying.

196
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:00,977
That too, at a time when girls come out
in groups after their classes are over.

197
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,179
For displaying private parts of
his body in a vulgar manner.

198
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:06,751
Sir, he was urinating.

199
00:17:06,825 --> 00:17:08,986
He should have done it without
taking it out. - How?

200
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:10,062
He can't!

201
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:11,120
So knowing that,

202
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,265
in front of a girls' school;
that too, an ideal teacher;

203
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:18,470
moreover, a Clean lndia
Mission functionary;

204
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,199
should never have done that.

205
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,142
So, section 292 and 293;

206
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,035
charging these sections;

207
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:29,141

 order a case to charged and
procedures to be initiated.

208
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:30,716
That means?

209
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,718
You'll be behind bars for 2.5 years.
- Oh God!

210
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:34,310
And a fine of1 Lakh Rupees.

211
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:37,314
You bloody Binu Choorezhan Advocate!

212
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:38,512
Lostwhat we had in hand.

213
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,826
And lost what we were vying for.

214
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,195
Next.

215
00:17:44,263 --> 00:17:46,891
There's no problem if we come drunk to
this court, but pissing is a problem.

216
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,801
I heard that she's
going to get married.

217
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,172
Will she stop acting?

218
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:54,139
Where will she go?

219
00:17:54,273 --> 00:17:56,475
She'll come back after a long
time in a mother’s role.

220
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,772
And we ourselves have to suffer.

221
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,400
This is not original beauty.

222
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:00,603
It's all make-up.

223
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:02,481
l have seen her Aadhaar card.

224
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,642
If so, have you seen Dulquer
Salmaan's Aadhaar card?

225
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,785
He might look like
this advocate's twin.

226
00:18:07,486 --> 00:18:09,181
- Who is he?
- You didn't meet him, right?

227
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:10,550
He's my new client, Saji.

228
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,654
Did the new client hear the
advocate's plea today?

229
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,694
No. ljust reached now.
- Good.

230
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:16,661
Right?

231
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:19,788
You talked about Aadhaar card, right?
Is that yourjob? Making Aadhaar cards?

232
00:18:19,865 --> 00:18:21,628
No.
He's a pick-pocket.

233
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,667
A professional.

234
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:23,802
My purse..

235
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:25,200
Shall we order a Dosa each?

236
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,805
Shall I?
- Whyjust one Dosa?

237
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:27,772
Make it two!

238
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:28,874
Two Dosas, please.

239
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,466
We can take it as part
of your fees, right?

240
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:32,442
It's okay. There are so
many people here, right?

241
00:18:32,544 --> 00:18:34,239
We'll get it.
Then what!

242
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,715
So you're going to pay my
fees by picking pockets?

243
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:40,446
I can pay the fees only
from my income, right?

244
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:42,520
Instead I can't go rob or
steal from someone, right?

245
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:47,288
Didn't this girl give birth yet?

246
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,397
Who did this atrocity
to that poor girl?

247
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,796
If I could lay my hands on him..

248
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,132
lt'sthe guy in red shirt
eating Dosa over there.

249
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,429
He's a fierce Goon.

250
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,697
Our KD Advocate's left-hand.

251
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:03,199
Lay your hands now itself.
- Oh my God!

252
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,870
If so, it wouldn't be deliberate.
It might have just happened.

253
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,716
lfthe one sitting next
to him is KD's client;

254
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,410
his bad times have started.

255
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,728
Where's the stand?
- Namaste sir.

256
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,625
He is the client I
told you about.

257
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,735
Hey! Come here.
- Go.

258
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,167
Has the opposite party come?

259
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,896
Well..
- Has he come?

260
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,873
There he is, sir.
- Hey. Come here.

261
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:40,274
Look at his walk!

262
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,777
What's your problem?

263
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,541
He hit you, right?

264
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,445
Yes.
He hit me publicly.

265
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,778
This is also a public place.

266
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:50,889
Hit him back.

267
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:52,450
Which section?

268
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:55,624
Imagine a number in your mind.

269
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,694
100.

270
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,263
IPC 100.

271
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,256
That's the section.

272
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,432
In my cases, I myself am the
court, judge and magistrate.

273
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,633
I'll get it done by thetime you
count to four. - That's all.

274
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:08,773
Hit him back.

275
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:10,774
Well sir.. 
..

276
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:14,541
If you can't hit back the guy who hit
you, what kind of a goon are you?

277
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:15,613
lnsult to goons!

278
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:18,883
Com promise.

279
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,216
Bring it here.

280
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,510
Bring it here, man.

281
00:20:22,688 --> 00:20:23,655
Give me your hand.

282
00:20:24,623 --> 00:20:25,590
You're so arrogant, huh?

283
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,618
One kick I'll give you.

284
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,996
How is it now?
Aren't you happy?

285
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:34,793
Aren't you also happy?

286
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,366
Then give me myfees.

287
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:38,436
Murugan!

288
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:40,238
Give me my poison.

289
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:41,839
Here.

290
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:46,744
Give me the money.

291
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:05,958
Hello! Stop there.

292
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,298
Where are you going?

293
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,300
This won't be allowed here.

294
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,036
What?
- Sitting here & boozing.

295
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:12,697
But who boozed here?
- Then what's this?

296
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:14,997
This?

297
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,366
Don't mess with me.

298
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,705
I've told you not to touch me.

299
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,579
Ya right! So virtuous.
- You can't booze here.

300
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:22,444
I will sit here & booze.
You get lost.

301
00:21:23,915 --> 00:21:24,882
Oh my God!

302
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,353
No one should catch him.

303
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:29,650
Poor Rowdy Advocate.

304
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,450
Give me your hand.
- Move away!

305
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,325
Slowly.

306
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,326
Move.

307
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,793
lsaid don't touch him.

308
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:37,293
Don't scare me, man!

309
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,329
Lie sideways. Or if it pierces through
your tummy & cuts your intestine..

310
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,334
then no point in living.

311
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:43,301
Don't move, Advocate.

312
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:45,496
Don't tickle me.

313
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,299
What are you doing?
Don't tickle me.

314
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,031
Don't move at all.

315
00:21:49,574 --> 00:21:50,541
Don't move.

316
00:21:55,414 --> 00:21:56,813
There might be glass pieces.

317
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,419
You loser! You drankthat too?

318
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,754
l was wondering where to get a drink from.
Now get up & go!

319
00:22:02,754 --> 00:22:03,721
Thorappan, catch me.

320
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,016
You'll never learn.
-Gota 1.5 peg on a 1st.

321
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,326
Now see.

322
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,928
I knew itwhen I saw yourtummy,
that there was a bottle in there.

323
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,088
Then what's this?
A bar?

324
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:12,989
I'll get back to you later.

325
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,890
Wait & watch.

326
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:32,074
Nithin.
- Hi Chechi.

327
00:22:34,152 --> 00:22:35,119
Wait, dear.

328
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,417
Show it to me, Chechi.
- Come in, boy.

329
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,489
You're back?

330
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:41,421
What is this?
- Wait.

331
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,496
Happy Birthday!

332
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:48,394
We'll cut it once
dad comes home.

333
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,105
Let me see it once more.
- We'll cut it after dad comes.

334
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:57,175
Dear, someone had come from
the co-operative bank.

335
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,439
He said that we haven't
paid the overdue amount.

336
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,476
I'm not having any peace of mind.

337
00:23:03,448 --> 00:23:05,814
Don't say this as soon
as dad comes home.

338
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:07,811
Today is my brother’s day!

339
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:11,087
Dad would have figured
out a solution.

340
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,489
Nithin!
-Yes!

341
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,459
Hey Nithin! Come here.
- What?

342
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:19,621
Come here.
- What's this?

343
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:21,632

 forgot to show you something.
Look.

344
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,028
See.
- Wow. Dad!

345
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,968
It has got many likes and shares.
- Is it?

346
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,836
Many have commented that the traffic
policemen should learn from dad.

347
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,706
Oh God! His work is so difficult.

348
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:38,514
These car drivers cause all the block,
and then blame the two wheelers.

349
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:40,380
You feel that because
you don't have a car.

350
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,612
That's called jealousy.

351
00:23:43,188 --> 00:23:46,988
When this light was turned off for some
days, it was like a temple without lights.

352
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,194
Right?
It was so inauspicious.

353
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,593
That's for your alcoholics.

354
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:58,396
It's high time that
you started boozing.

355
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:00,937
There's no change in my stand.

356
00:24:01,206 --> 00:24:03,475
Let me win a great case first.
Then I'll drink.

357
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,170
So you're not going to
drink in this lifetime.

358
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,707
Then why do you find crooked
ways to fight cases?

359
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,415
Didn't you see
today's situation?

360
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,215
It's good, right? You got a column
to write on your newspaper tomorrow.

361
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:18,990
My dear Pappettan,

362
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:21,682
there are around 1 Lakh
Advocates in Kerala alone.

363
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,722
If I tryto make a mark in between
them through proper ways,

364
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,031
it won't happen in this life.

365
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:29,023
That's true. Through crooked cases,
you can reach even the Supreme Court.

366
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,202
That's it!

367
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:32,170
Can you please stop talking
about court matters?

368
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:35,230
Binu, l was waiting to ask
you after having a drink.

369
00:24:35,941 --> 00:24:38,210
Why are you behind that
girl who runs the canteen?

370
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:39,177
Who?
Sindhu?

371
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,077
I know her since
our school days.

372
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,215
What's the point?

373
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:45,217
There should be something
good about a person, right?

374
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,218
It's all right.

375
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:49,517
You are an advocate, right?
Don't you have brains?

376
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,189
Dude, what does she lack?

377
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,156
She?

378
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:54,114
What does she lack?

379
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,558
So you were pulling my leg, huh?

380
00:24:57,195 --> 00:24:59,163
You took so long to
realize that itself.

381
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,199
Why do you call
yourself an advocate?

382
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,496
Think about it..

383
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:06,593
If you stand with her, it will be like a
vanilla ice cream, with tar poured over it.

384
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:07,772
Get lost, you dog!

385
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:13,175
Not so bad.

386
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:16,269
You keep looking at
that photo often.

387
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,216
Should I inform your
wife about the affair?

388
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:19,740
Sheesh. This is her photo only.

389
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:23,145
When I keep looking at this photo,
her beauty keeps increasing.

390
00:25:23,221 --> 00:25:26,190
Then I'll understand that I'm really drunk.
Then I'll feel like going home.

391
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:27,758
That's nice.

392
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,258
So friends, let's start.

393
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,925
'Me, my beloved & those 40 companions'

394
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,931
Binu, your father-in-law
has started his concert.

395
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:38,762
'Made a ship with MH bottles'

396
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,732
How are the marriage proposals for
your elder girl coming along?

397
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:43,171
One is almost confirmed.

398
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,269
They don't have much demands.
- That's good.

399
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:49,609
But when it's a wedding, we need to have
enough money to do it decently, right?

400
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,581
ltwill be sorted, Suku.

401
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:54,674
Wish your boy a happy birthday on my behalf
- Okay.

402
00:25:55,353 --> 00:25:57,514
I'll give that tomorrow.
- Okay. Good night.

403
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,851
His father-in-law's
vehicle is parked here.

404
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:04,518
Pappetta, go on this.
Police won't catch you.

405
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:06,028
See whether your
wife is beautiful.

406
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:07,791
Yeah! She's looking
like Anushka now.

407
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,130
Get home before she turns ugly.
- Okay.

408
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,204
Don'tturn it, man.
l have diarrhoea.

409
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:14,171
Stop there.

410
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,707
Pappettan!

411
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,308
Both you & the car
have the same shape!

412
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:19,934
Get lost!
- Both are flops!

413
00:26:20,211 --> 00:26:21,178
Start!

414
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,905
Police!
- But I didn't drink.

415
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:28,178
That'strue. Then I have
to ask him some questions.

416
00:26:29,654 --> 00:26:31,315
You're waiting right outside?

417
00:26:31,389 --> 00:26:33,050
Why don't you come inside
& test the breath?

418
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,718
I'm not a policeman, dear.
lam a home guard.

419
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,657
We don't have the power
to test the breath.

420
00:26:38,296 --> 00:26:41,288
And ya, there's a checking at the
turning near the bank. Go this way.

421
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,135
That's nice.

422
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:47,770
There are so many
DGPs in Kerala.

423
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,898
People like him
should be made DGPs.

424
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:55,169
OPD11I18

425
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:11,195
God!

426
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,361
Homely girl!

427
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,909
The opposite party was adamant that
this case should be fought in court,

428
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,810
to harass my innocent
client, deliberately.

429
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,738
Sir, you should
hear what happened.

430
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,173
Nothing happened, sir.

431
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:35,250
My client was sleeping
after her daily chores.

432
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:40,887
The opposite client who reached the
house, fully sloshed after a tour...

433
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,219
Manju..

434
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,024
Hey Manju..

435
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:46,197
Leave m e.

436
00:27:48,233 --> 00:27:49,200
Manju?

437
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:51,299
Hey! Who is Manju?

438
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:52,737
Which Manju?

439
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,969
What is it, Manju?

440
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,204
No. Leela..
- Leela is my name.

441
00:27:58,309 --> 00:27:59,276
Who is Manju?

442
00:27:59,778 --> 00:28:00,745
Get up!

443
00:28:00,812 --> 00:28:01,779
Who is Manju?

444
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,710
I called you Leela only.

445
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,212
You might have
heard it as Manju.

446
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,985
Come. Let's sleep.

447
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:09,254
I'm not deaf to hear it as
Leela if you call me Manju.

448
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:10,414
My dear Manju..

449
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,115
Again?

450
00:28:12,223 --> 00:28:14,088
My dear Leela..
- Move.

451
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:17,762
I knew it when you came to bed
even without changing clothes,

452
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:20,060
right after your tour, that
there's something fishy.

453
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,890
Tell me.
Who is this Leela?

454
00:28:21,966 --> 00:28:23,365
Leela is you, right?
- No!

455
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:24,769
No?

456
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,070
Ya. lam Leela.

457
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,206
Who is Manju?

458
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,270
I didn't call you Manju.

459
00:28:31,342 --> 00:28:33,139
You called!
You called!

460
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,235
Leela, I didn't.
You called.

461
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:36,280
No!

462
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:38,376
You called.
I am sure.

463
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,884
I also heard.
Sir called her Manju only.

464
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:41,919
Right, dear?

465
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,114
Lying after boozing?

466
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,189
Who is he?

467
00:28:53,198 --> 00:28:54,165
Oh my God!

468
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,790
Sir,

469
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,723
why are you bringing these
family court matters to me?

470
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,231
Don't you know that
I'm a BP patient?

471
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,222
Things will be solved
faster if it's here.

472
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,097
To Kerala..
I mean..

473
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,362
Your court is an example
to all of India, sir.

474
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,245
Which other court in India gives a verdict
withjust1 or2 holidays in between?

475
00:29:40,245 --> 00:29:44,375
Binu, if you praise me any more,
my head will go hitthat fan up there.

476
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,254
This is a foul play to get a divorce
without paying a maintenance,

477
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,188
by tarnishing my
client's character.

478
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:53,218
Like Dushyanthan left Shakunthala..

479
00:29:53,491 --> 00:29:54,458
In this court?

480
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,824
Like Mary Magdelene..
- Hey!

481
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:58,395
Come here.

482
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:05,930
What is it, sir? - You just want
me to accept the file, right?

483
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:06,971
I'll do that.

484
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,373
But about my
client's innocence..

485
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:14,001
If you keep talking, you'll say
that she's purerthan Virgin Mary.

486
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,207
This case is postponed to 22nd.

487
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,251
This isjust like plucking
atree for Binu sir.

488
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,549
Hearing my law-points, the
magistrate was trembling.

489
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,144
I taught them to you, right?

490
00:30:29,861 --> 00:30:31,055
Happy?
- Yes.

491
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,230
Okay then.
- Thanks.

492
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,809
I can't breathe.

493
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,910
Feels so good.

494
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:50,915
Happy?

495
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:52,216
Happy!

496
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,218
Bye.
- Bye!

497
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:01,322
Keep this as well.
(Kisses)

498
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,262
Why didn't she hug me?

499
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:07,197
The beetle can find out which
flower has honey, precisely.

500
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,233
Silly boy!

501
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:12,596
Today's treat is on me.
- No need.

502
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:18,235
Queen of Jhansi.

503
00:31:19,277 --> 00:31:20,244
Hey!

504
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,681
If you give me the money for
the milk, we can leave.

505
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:25,148
But you took extra
yesterday, right?

506
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,480
But this has 2 litres extra.
- What? Water?

507
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:29,977
Don't talk to me
like I'm a stranger.

508
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,146
You're imagining that, dad.

509
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,280
It's not my imagination.

510
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,950
Many a times, when 

see my colour I feel..

511
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,285
that I am a stranger to you.

512
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,488
Dad, don't talk nonsense.
- Started again?

513
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,459
Why do you want to clear accounts
with your own father, dear?

514
00:31:41,532 --> 00:31:43,625
Oh! Then we'll clear yours.
Shall I open the tab book?

515
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:44,668
No need.

516
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,328
'Karunya' (Mercy) lottery.

517
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,273
Give me that milk.
- Today's 'Karu nya'.

518
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,174
Mercy! She doesn't show any mercy to me.
And you want that?

519
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,209
Get lost!

520
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:55,308
Today I'm going to open
my heart before Sindhu.

521
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,211
Have you attached a
zip on your chest?

522
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,075
I'm not considering this as a lame
clerk pulling the leg of an advocate.

523
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,218
I'll tell her today anyway.

524
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:08,192
And she will ask, 'Why didn't you
tell this to me all these days?'

525
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,226
Wait & watch.

526
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:12,329
Look at that song.

527
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,172
I've been wanting to say something
to you for a long time.

528
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,274
I also wanted to say
something to you.

529
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,275
Is it?
- Ya.

530
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,436
lwas waiting until I
had some money in hand.

531
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:28,046
l was also waiting for that.

532
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,280
Then wait some more.

533
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,679
We're in a hurry.

534
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:31,715
Binu sir, come.

535
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,917
What hurry?

536
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:37,382
It's a fund collection forthe
old age home run by the Church.

537
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,115
ljust remembered that Mani said we
were in a hurry. Shouldn't we go?

538
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,559
No hurry at all.
We can go next month.

539
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:43,220

 just remembered.
Sindhu, continue.

540
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,263
You're a lawyer with
many big cases, right?

541
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,389
Who? Me?
- Yes.

542
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,522
No doubt about that.

543
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:50,359
ln charging fees, he's right
after Ram Jethmalani.

544
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,734
There aren't many people to whom I
can askthis freely in this town.

545
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:57,241
And we can ask like this only
to people dearto us, right?

546
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:58,208
That's why.

547
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:05,242
This charity has been in
my blood since childhood.

548
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:07,512
Happy?
- Thank you.

549
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,586
It's okay.

550
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,987
When I think about people who are not
looked after by their children, lfeel..

551
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,358
But you haven't given my
mother even 10 Rupees!

552
00:33:14,425 --> 00:33:15,619
Shut up you idiot!

553
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,727
There are 3 people in
your house, right?

554
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,059
Ramani Chechi, 3 packets.
- Okay dear.

555
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:22,061
So, come home at times..

556
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,565
We give Parotta & Beef free
for those who give donations.

557
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,128
Parotta is slightly..

558
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:29,229
We serve only fresh items here.
- Give it.

559
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:31,741
Okay.
Thank you.

560
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,043
One more thing.

561
00:33:33,144 --> 00:33:34,771
Keep this as well.
- What's this?

562
00:33:37,281 --> 00:33:38,771
Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

563
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:44,521
Hey!

564
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:49,691
There are 7 people in my house.

565
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:51,351
Ramani Chechi, 7 packets.

566
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,424
Beef is superb, right?

567
00:33:56,567 --> 00:33:59,661
To donate whatever you get, who are you?
Kochouseph Chittilappally?

568
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,403
Or Daddy Girija?

569
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:03,597
Daddy Girija?

570
00:34:03,674 --> 00:34:05,665
Then why don't you donate
our kidneys as well?

571
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:06,801
Leave it, mom!

572
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,342
I gave that money
for a good deed!

573
00:34:08,413 --> 00:34:09,812
Sitdown and eat, mom.
- No!

574
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,638
I don't want Parotta
that costs 1000 Rupees.

575
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,513
I will cook food for myself.

576
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:27,189
Initially, lthought of buying a
hearing machine with the money I got.

577
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,755
Why do we need a washing machine?

578
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,397
Come.
- Oh! lforgot. I'll wear it.

579
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,307
With the money I got,
awashing machine..

580
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:38,275
lthought I'll buy a
hearing machine initially.

581
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,312
I swear!

582
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,280
It's called cochlear implant.

583
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:47,181
But to get quality stuff, it
costs around 30,000 Rupees.

584
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,582
30,000 Rupees?

585
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:52,111
My God! With 30,000 Rupees,
I can fix a new ear.

586
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:54,317
Well, itwill actually
be like a new ear only.

587
00:34:54,826 --> 00:34:56,760
Wait & watch.
I'll buy one foryou.

588
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:58,694
And I'll host your
wedding in a grand way.

589
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:00,263
Ya rig ht!

590
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,693
My dear Beena,

591
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:03,629
I'll send you to some convent.

592
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:07,327
And then I'll start working
as a domestic help there.

593
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,666
Can't trust him anyway..

594
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,673
What are you saying, mom?

595
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,436
Cases will keep coming.
Money also.

596
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,377
Don't utter a word
about cases and money!

597
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,311
A dad who went bankrupt
by fighting a case;

598
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,248
and a son who wants to go bankrupt
by donating all the money he gets.

599
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,252
My God!

600
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,689
Hey!
What?

601
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,202
It's a photo taken during
dad's college days.

602
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,306
Butfrom his expression,

603
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:46,265
seems like he already knew that he'll go
bankrupt with debts after 40 years, right?

604
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,115
Hey! Turn around!
Let me see!

605
00:36:03,794 --> 00:36:04,761
What?
- Nothing.

606
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,262
Get lost.
- Stop.

607
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,358
You've been behind that Sindhu
since your school days, right?

608
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,703
Why can't you tell her
how you feel about her?

609
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:16,831
You can't confess your love to a girl, and
you want to be a lawyer at Supreme Court?

610
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,242
What's the use?

611
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,640
Advocate, it seems.

612
00:36:28,819 --> 00:36:34,553
'Why were these eyes waiting for
Your moonlit smile?'

613
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:40,753
'Why are your words like a magical rain,
heard by these ears?‘

614
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:52,577
'You flow like a river,
cascading in rhythm all over me, its shore;

615
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:58,812
splashing snowflakes in
the garden of my heart'

616
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:04,583
'Why were these eyes waiting for
Your moonlit smile?'

617
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:10,285
'Why are your words like a magical rain,
heard by these ears?‘

618
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:21,695
'You flow like a river,
cascading in rhythm all over me, its shore;

619
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:28,568
splashing snowflakes in
the garden of my heart'

620
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,684
Oh my God!

621
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:46,897
Get lost!

622
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,299
What happened here?

623
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,667
What's the problem?

624
00:37:53,504 --> 00:38:03,539
'Didn't we meet during twilight
on one ofthose days?'

625
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:15,882
'Didn't you come tiptoeing through
the backdoor of my dreams?'

626
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:31,671
'You're turning into my desires, my sky'

627
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:34,310
'My mind is turning
into a silver cloud'

628
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:40,918
'Why were these eyes waiting for
Your moonlit smile?'

629
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:46,686
'Why are your words like a magical rain,
heard by these ears?‘

630
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:33,598
'My heart is strewn on this pathway,
as jasmine flowers, for you to see'

631
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:45,881
'We move along these days and nights, not
confessing our silent love for each other'

632
00:39:45,950 --> 00:40:01,662
'You turn the silence
inside me into music'

633
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,096
'With your sweet words'

634
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:10,134
'Why were these eyes waiting for
Your moonlit smile?'

635
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:16,507
'Why are your words like a magical rain,
heard by these ears?‘

636
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:34,162
'You flow like a river,
cascading in rhythm all over me, its shore;

637
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:41,168
splashing snowflakes in
the garden of my heart'

638
00:40:47,211 --> 00:40:49,179
Sir, we took that
girl's statement.

639
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:51,908
That girl said..

640
00:40:54,718 --> 00:40:57,152
It's a confirmed case
of brutal gang-rape.

641
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:00,716
That too, a minor girl.

642
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:06,126
The incidents that followed,
it's unbelievable, sir.

643
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,532
Isn't it like a mystery?

644
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:18,132
So Mr. Paulraj,

645
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:20,908
did you read the statement?

646
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:32,583
Anbu, Dinesh, Senthil.

647
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,159
All three were studying MBBS.

648
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,148
So what, sir?

649
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,763
I think that they must have
done that rape attempt.

650
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:41,060
lt's notjust an attempt, sir.

651
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,132
Rape.

652
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:43,224
That too, a gang rape, sir.

653
00:41:44,134 --> 00:41:47,592
Three ofthem brutally raped that
girl, who'sjust in tenth grade.

654
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,902
A girl who already
lost her parents.

655
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:52,175
They beat up her grandfather
who tried to stop them.

656
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,209
And you're talking
about it so casually.

657
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:55,745
See Mr. Paulraj,

658
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,215
Now the case is notjust
about rape or a tussle;

659
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,149
It has gone beyond all that.
Okay?

660
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,583
Who do you think these boys are?

661
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,189
One is mill owner
Kuppusamy Gounder's son.

662
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,158
Another one is High Court
judge Karthikeyan sir's son.

663
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:10,088
And thatAnbu,

664
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,890
He's health minister
Thirumalaichelvan's son.

665
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,821
We are answerable to them.

666
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:15,866
But sir..

667
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,927
Do afull enquiry.

668
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,535
Let's learn what happened.

669
00:42:19,803 --> 00:42:21,270
All three are sons of big shots.

670
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:22,973
Very serious matter.

671
00:42:22,973 --> 00:42:24,133
Lot of pressure also.

672
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,266
You know very well, so..

673
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,101
Investigate in detail.

674
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,940
And do it fast.
Okay?

675
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,812
Okay sir.

676
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:35,285
Bye sir.

677
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,313
There are so many
lawyers with cars.

678
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:41,889
And I'm stuck with you on this
2 wheeler in the hot sun.

679
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:44,995
My fate!
- Then take the bus from tomorrow.

680
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,797
Stop near that lottery seller.

681
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:48,731
You didn't win the last time also, right?
- Stop.

682
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,062
Ideal with him in Iakhs.

683
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,267
Give me 65 Iakhs.

684
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:56,634
Let me check once.

685
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:58,934
Oh no!
- What happened?

686
00:42:59,643 --> 00:43:01,008
Your missed 5000
Rupees for 2 numbers.

687
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,109
The other 2 numbers are correct, right?
- Yes.

688
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,340
Then can't you give me 2500?

689
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:06,115
How's that possible?
- Binu!

690
00:43:06,784 --> 00:43:08,385
Shall I give you one
that'll definitely win?

691
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:09,647
Shall I pay after winning?

692
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:13,790
It's a news that I gave.

693
00:43:14,024 --> 00:43:14,991
Let me see.

694
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,292
Marriage dreams of actress Aishwarya.

695
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,665
Do you know something?

696
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,298
I got an actress'
marriage proposal once.

697
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,994
It was 50% okay.

698
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,831
Your 50%, right?

699
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:29,998
Binu sir, there's a case.

700
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,902
Case?
- Just watch the news.

701
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:33,944
The accident happened
late during yesterday night.

702
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,373
Before reaching the hospital,
death had occurred.

703
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,677
Mamalayoor Mount Zion Hospital..
- This is that..

704
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:40,917
It's that home guard.

705
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,951
We saw him in front of the
bar yesterday, right?

706
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,916
For the vehicle that him..

707
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:49,326
Some vehicle hit him and fled, in front
of Mount Zion hospital, it seems.

708
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:52,762
Sukumaran from Mamalayoor was working
as a home guard in a temporary post.

709
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,799
Police says that the incident happened
while he was going back home,

710
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,596
after his duty at the hanging bridge.

711
00:44:07,411 --> 00:44:08,776
He was a good man, right?

712
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,174
Did you know him?
- No.

713
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,348
Then?

714
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:14,179
This is how people talk at a
dead person's house, right?

715
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,119
You're an actress, right?

716
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,225
Roshi, don'tjust sit there.
Do something, you egoistic idiot.

717
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,328
So I need my money.

718
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,376
I asked you to stop the car here, to talk
to you about something urgent, Roshi.

719
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:53,774
And not to sit here and smoke.

720
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,945
I'm good.
Tell me.

721
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:58,149
My wedding will happen next month.

722
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:03,090
Afterthat, I'll migrate
to Australia with Hari.

723
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,223
So I need my money.

724
00:46:09,399 --> 00:46:13,859
Your badminton league & villa
projects that you marketed with me;

725
00:46:14,004 --> 00:46:16,097
and the money you kept
promising me for all that.

726
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,407
I want that.

727
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,474
Don't think you can
settle me for peanuts.

728
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:22,479
I need a share.

729
00:46:24,214 --> 00:46:25,181
30%

730
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,482
30 Per Cent?

731
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,179
Your name is Aishwarya Nair.

732
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,948
And notAishwarya Rai, right?

733
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:37,288
Say whatever you want to.

734
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:42,558
To use me for anything and everything,
I'm not your private property.

735
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:44,834
Aren't you?

736
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:47,771
Answer me.

737
00:46:48,238 --> 00:46:50,934
Will you give me the money or not?
- Shall I ask you one thing?

738
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,537
What if! don't give?

739
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,308
This is cheating, Roshi.
I'll go to court.

740
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:00,282
I know what to do.

741
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:10,958
You can't park here, sir.

742
00:47:11,128 --> 00:47:12,095
Who are you?

743
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,061
You're an actress, right?
- Tell me the matter.

744
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,434
Kerala Home Guard.

745
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,493
We are on traffic control duty.

746
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,231
Home Guard?
Get lost!

747
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:22,396
I'll go.

748
00:47:22,873 --> 00:47:25,501
But you can't do such activities
of yours parking the car here.

749
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:26,577
What?

750
00:47:26,577 --> 00:47:28,602
It's a turning, sir.
And a hospital afterthat.

751
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:31,380
Ambulances keep coming regularly.
Park the car elsewhere.

752
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:33,517
Roshi, start the car.
Let's go.

753
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:38,284
Roshi didn't buy this car to move it
when some random loser asks me to!

754
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:40,281
Sir, move the vehicle.

755
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:43,048
What will you do otherwise?
- Roshi, no!

756
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:48,597
Call!
Call whomever you want to!

757
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,894
Commissioner or IG or whoever..

758
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:54,894
Don't take my photo.
-Why is he taking a photo?

759
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,596
Don't take my photos.
- Bloody hell.

760
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:00,475
I don't have such big
contacts to call, sir.

761
00:48:00,611 --> 00:48:01,976
I'm just a home guard, right?

762
00:48:02,112 --> 00:48:03,909
All I have is some
self respect.

763
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,648
And ya, I have a Facebook account as well.
So, good night.

764
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:14,924
Roshi, don'tjust sit there.
Do something, you egoistic idiot.

765
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,519
Because of your damned ego,
all our lives will be ruined.

766
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,191
Go and getthat phone from him.

767
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,337
We have to get that phone
back from him somehow.

768
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,110
Go fast!

769
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,206
Hey! That's him.
- Where?

770
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:40,974
There!
- Stop!

771
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,972
There.
He's there.

772
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,004
And did he die on the spot?

773
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,624
For a matter that could have
been solved by talking..

774
00:49:59,029 --> 00:49:59,996
He killed him.

775
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:04,730
If I don't talk about something
I saw right in front of me,

776
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,065
I'll never get peace of mind.

777
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:10,603
But there shouldn't be any problems
in my personal life because of that.

778
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:14,266
There aren't any criminal lawyers in
this city whom Roshi doesn't know.

779
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:17,679
I can't take this forward
trusting any ofthem.

780
00:50:18,081 --> 00:50:20,174
The case should be charged
where the incident happened.

781
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,384
And I know only you
there, Pappettan.

782
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:23,419
Understood.

783
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:25,255
That's why! brought him along.

784
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,381
He's my guy.

785
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,387
Sorry.. I...

786
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,756
This is thefirst time I'm
seeing an actress in person.

787
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,525
Continue, Madam.
- My name shouldn't come anywhere.

788
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:37,492
Before he knows that
I'm behind this,

789
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,430
he should be arrested
and sent to jail.

790
00:50:40,837 --> 00:50:41,804
Is it possible?

791
00:50:42,439 --> 00:50:45,374
The dead man is from my town.

792
00:50:46,443 --> 00:50:47,477
We can do this.

793
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,413
Newspapers, media..
- No one will know anything.

794
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:50,641
We'll deal all that.

795
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,648
You've acted in a
face cream ad, right?

796
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,787
Yes.

797
00:50:58,121 --> 00:50:59,645
Why?
- There's a new rule.

798
00:51:00,157 --> 00:51:02,421
If you promise fairness
and it doesn't happen,

799
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:05,825
a case can be charged against that company
& the person who promised fairness.

800
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,821
So even if such a case
comes,just call me.

801
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:10,294
It will make people fair.
- No!

802
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,795
I used it fora long time.

803
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:13,170
That's why I said that.

804
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,137
Okay.

805
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:16,033
I wanted to file a case myself.

806
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:20,507
The accident happened within
Mamalayoor police station limits.

807
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,269
This CI is in charge there.

808
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,681
The vehicle is parked as it was
after the incident? - Yes sir.

809
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,853
Did he drive the car?
- Yes sir.

810
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,528
We always tell him to drive
carefully, but he doesn't listen.

811
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,568
We can register this as
section 209, right sir?

812
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:47,261
The culprit surrendered
directly, right?

813
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:49,639
You come here.

814
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:55,174
What's your name?
- Dennis.

815
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:57,207
Did you drive the car?
- Yes sir.

816
00:51:57,714 --> 00:51:59,807
Then get into the car.
- Why sir?

817
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,673
Get in, man!
-Sir..

818
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,851
Get inside, I say!

819
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,221
Sit without adjusting the seat.

820
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,193
What is it?
You can't sit?

821
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:19,368
Sir..

822
00:52:20,403 --> 00:52:21,370
He..

823
00:52:21,705 --> 00:52:22,672
Get out, man!

824
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:27,244
lfthe car is parked in the same
condition as it was brought here,

825
00:52:27,244 --> 00:52:29,178
it's not him who drove
the car, Swamy sir.

826
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:36,511
Someone who's not taller than 5
feet 6 or 7 inches drove the car.

827
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:38,582
Is there someone like that here?

828
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:40,690
Well..

829
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:42,451
Please come, sir.

830
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,228
3 crores?

831
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,563
Roshi, it's notjust for him.

832
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:57,240
Then?

833
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,442
Dennis is also asking for money.

834
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:02,377
He said there's no one to look after
his family once he goes to jail.

835
00:53:02,479 --> 00:53:05,482
See Roshi, this case cannot
be solved by a CI alone.

836
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:09,384
The officers above and under him, the
magistrate.. We'll have to pay all of them.

837
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:12,922
We're compromising a case where you'll
have to go to jail for minimum 7 years.

838
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:14,590
Okay.

839
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,625
Then so be it.

840
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:18,361
Come.

841
00:53:30,941 --> 00:53:33,637
So, Roshi has agreed.

842
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:35,745
Good.

843
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,272
Handcuff me, if you want to.

844
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:41,384
What isthis, Roshi?

845
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,245
If he arrests me, I don't
have to pay any money, right?

846
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,289
Roshi, you're not understanding
the seriousness..

847
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,452
There are no evidences
against me.

848
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,727
And we need to find a solution
to all this today itself.

849
00:53:52,295 --> 00:53:54,525
I can't waste my time for
this tomorrow onwards.

850
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:56,424
So let the arrest happen.

851
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,967
And Swamy,

852
00:53:58,034 --> 00:53:59,899
You will get methe bail.

853
00:54:00,003 --> 00:54:01,300
Roshi, today is Sunday.

854
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:04,572
We can get bail only after
producing you in court tomorrow.

855
00:54:04,641 --> 00:54:07,371
ljust have to stay for one night
at the police station, right? - Ya.

856
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:08,877
I'll do that.

857
00:54:09,312 --> 00:54:10,279
Let's go, sir.

858
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:14,710
Throw the leaf backwards,

859
00:54:14,818 --> 00:54:16,376
and dip your head thrice.

860
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:21,513
He studies really well.

861
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:25,290
Dad always said that he should
be educated as much as he could.

862
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,265
Go up.

863
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,505
Come.

864
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:43,970
Did you know dad?
-We'vejust seen him around.

865
00:54:49,753 --> 00:54:51,414
We don't want to fight
this case, sir.

866
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:54,722
But that doesn't mean we'll accept
the money that someone offers us.

867
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:57,289
But if you don't file a case,

868
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,553
the one who killed your
father will escape.

869
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,392
Didn't they say that
they don't want a case?

870
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,658
Get in, mother.
Let's go.

871
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,866
That family's condition
is very bad, Dad.

872
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:12,508
3 children.

873
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,409
Their father..
He was a home guard.

874
00:55:16,012 --> 00:55:18,537
While coming back after work from
the hanging bridgejunction,

875
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,442
someone who was driving
drunk, crashed on to him.

876
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,476
He died on the spot.

877
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:29,392
Go on!

878
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,861
I'm thinking that I
should accept this case.

879
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,888
The eye-witness to the
incident is in my custody now.

880
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,032
But the problem is that..

881
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,860
the home guard's family is not
interested in fighting the case.

882
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:45,442
My doubt is that the people of
the guy who crashed the car,

883
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:48,343
must have scared that family,
asking them not to fight the case.

884
00:55:48,945 --> 00:55:49,877
Scoundrels.

885
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:50,913
Rascals.

886
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,315
What?

887
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:53,916
What did you say now?

888
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:55,884
I was saying something else.

889
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,443
No. Even after they're
dead and underthe earth,

890
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,580
you still hate my family, right?

891
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,749
I don't call them like this, right?

892
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,459
My God!

893
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:07,592
In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

894
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,892
Why did you give birth
to her, father-in-Iaw?

895
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:14,568
If I'm able to fight this case,
my life itself will change.

896
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,438
But how?
Who will help me?

897
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:21,971
Dad, you should convince the angels
there and sort everything out.

898
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:24,738
In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

899
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:26,816
Advocate Binu,

900
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:28,584
Advocate Binu!

901
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:30,153
Yes.
Oh Sir, you?

902
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:32,485
What are you doing in the cemetery?
Came to pray?

903
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,112
No. I came to dig a grave.

904
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:37,160
I didn't ask what Manikandan Pillai
was doing in a cemetery, right?

905
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,593
He came with me, sir.

906
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,630
Okay then.
Let's go.

907
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:41,722
Hey! Wait.

908
00:56:41,831 --> 00:56:42,798
Let m e ask.

909
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,866
I heard you praying to your dad.

910
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:47,096
I also read about that
case in the paper.

911
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:48,467
What did you do?

912
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:51,641
Praying so loudly. Sir got disturbed
between his prayers, right?

913
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,609
Say sorry.
- It's all right, Pillai.

914
00:56:54,644 --> 00:56:57,772
That witness you mentioned; will he
come to the court & say what he saw?

915
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:58,973
That's the problem, sir.

916
00:56:59,716 --> 00:57:01,650
No one should know that
she's the witness.

917
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,609
She won't come to the court.

918
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:07,622
Say something!
Say!

919
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,860
If those poor souls could getjustice,

920
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,819
the departed soul will get something right?
What was it?

921
00:57:16,466 --> 00:57:17,433
Won't he get it, sir?

922
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:18,993
There's one solution.

923
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:21,204
That means..
There are solutions for both.

924
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,171
Is it, sir?

925
00:57:22,872 --> 00:57:24,931
But that's all too much trouble.

926
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,698
My workload will increase.

927
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,878
And I'll lose my peace of mind.

928
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:32,182
Can't we be happy with cattle feed
theft cases, border arguments,

929
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:34,412
or cases like that divorce
case that you brought?

930
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:35,575
Don't say that, sir.

931
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:38,577
Didn't you hear me praying kneeling
down at my father's grave?

932
00:57:39,222 --> 00:57:40,849
It will be a relief
for that family.

933
00:57:40,924 --> 00:57:42,892
And I'll also be settled in life.
- Me too.

934
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:44,721
Please sir.
- Okay then.

935
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:46,562
Thank you sir.

936
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:49,691
You should be saying
thanks to your father.

937
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:53,525
Consider that he was the one who
made me think of this solution.

938
00:57:53,736 --> 00:57:55,101
Thanks, dad.

939
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:56,138
Oh Lord!

940
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,738
1850-1912?

941
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:03,243
1912?

942
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,743
Did your die sinking
in the Titanic ship?

943
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,247
Well.. The date..

944
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,884
But not here.
At Puthan Palli.

945
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:15,491
Come.

946
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:18,219
I was thinking.. Forthe money
they bought all this granite,

947
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:20,930
if those old men were fed
good food back then,

948
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,057
they would've lived a little longer.
- That's it.

949
00:58:52,929 --> 00:58:55,632
Do the needful for
everyone here, okay?

950
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:56,599
Let's go!

951
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,167
Didn't you tell him?

952
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,500
Since it's so late today,

953
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:03,503
the bench clerk was informed that
it won't happen today. - What?

954
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:04,640
Well..

955
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:07,868
after waiting all this while,
can we get bail only tomorrow?

956
00:59:07,977 --> 00:59:11,105
This magistrate had informed earlier
that he'll be on leave tomorrow, right?

957
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,183
Then we can get bail from some other court.
Why are we stuck here?

958
00:59:14,183 --> 00:59:16,515
The bail should be granted from the
station limit where it happened.

959
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,951
We can go to a higher court only
if we don't get it from here.

960
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:20,147
Pathetic crook..

961
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,985
So you can stay here as our
guest fortwo more days.

962
00:59:24,327 --> 00:59:25,885
Why are you staring, Roshi sir?

963
00:59:26,095 --> 00:59:28,962
Didn't I tell you decently that we'll
settle this? Then what did you say?

964
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:29,999
Now suffer..

965
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:32,800
Sabu, you said that there's
no water in the pipe, right?

966
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:34,860
Whatwill Roshi sir do
if he wants to shit?

967
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:37,907
If he wants to shit, he'll have to adjust
with some herb for the time being.

968
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:39,141
That's right.

969
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,073
Making me starve here for one whole day,

970
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,842
all of you are laughing?

971
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,316
Greedy cut-throat lawyer!

972
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,313
Roshi, did we ask you to starve?

973
00:59:51,387 --> 00:59:52,911
Didn't we bring you
food regularly?

974
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:56,891
I know that all of you played a part
in taking things to this level.

975
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:58,594
Even now I'm saying..

976
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:00,591
Roshi is not ready to pay!

977
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:04,028
And when that bloody Magistrate
comes, ifl don't get bail..

978
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,736
I won't consider that you're
Swamy & that you're my brother..

979
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:07,998
Hey! Enough!

980
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,766
This is a police station.

981
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,167
Don't create a scene here.

982
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:12,897
Go & sit there.
Sabu,

983
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:14,738
take him there.

984
01:00:15,378 --> 01:00:16,902
-Come..
-Sir..

985
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:18,004
Leave m e.

986
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,286
Since this is a Godforsaken
place, no one will know.

987
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:31,860
Instead if it was in Kochi,

988
01:00:32,061 --> 01:00:34,962
you'd have had to go back to being
a priest, leaving your Iawyerjob.

989
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:37,199
Not me.
The mobile.

990
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,367
Mobile.

991
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,602
Saved by the bell.

992
01:00:42,171 --> 01:00:43,798
It's me, Swamy.
Tell me.

993
01:00:49,746 --> 01:00:51,111
Any information on
who the person is?

994
01:00:53,082 --> 01:00:54,709
Okay. Thank you.

995
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,244
Salim will come and meet you.

996
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,419
Okay.

997
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,186
It's the Dafedar from the court.

998
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:02,151
Magistrate had called him.

999
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:07,123
He asked him to send the court register & the
book to record statements, to his house.

1000
01:01:07,196 --> 01:01:08,163
Why?

1001
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:12,290
He takes a leave 2 days
before his first big case.

1002
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,802
He gets all the court
papers sent to his house.

1003
01:01:16,239 --> 01:01:19,208
I have a strong doubt that someone
is going to give a secret statement.

1004
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,775
Directly to the Magistrate,
at his house.

1005
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,212
Whose statement?

1006
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:25,176
Roshi said that no one
else saw it, right?

1007
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,817
When Roshi did all this, one
girl was seeing all this, right?

1008
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,944
Roshi had said that
she won't say a word.

1009
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:31,848
Will it be someone else, Swamy?

1010
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:35,288
Ranjith, why does a random passer
by have to give a secret statement?

1011
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:36,747
This is her only.

1012
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:38,191
She is a celebrity.

1013
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,760
Publicity is an issue for her.

1014
01:01:39,829 --> 01:01:40,830
My God!

1015
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,127
Let me call Roshi.

1016
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,198
Let him know this.

1017
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:47,202
Why?

1018
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,362
We will make the decision.

1019
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,940
Let your dear brother be
in jail for 7 or 8 years.

1020
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:53,742
What are you saying, Swamy?

1021
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,743
Why? How come this sudden
sentiment towards him?

1022
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:57,814
No way.

1023
01:01:57,814 --> 01:02:00,214
Didn't you yourself tell me that
he tried to grope yourwife,

1024
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:02,716
and that he sent a dog to bite
her when she didn't agree?

1025
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,311
He's a scoundrel.
A bloody rascal.

1026
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,355
Let him stay there.

1027
01:02:18,134 --> 01:02:19,101
What?

1028
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,305
Crappy network.

1029
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,374
Look at him!

1030
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,017
Excuse me, Madam.
Can I take a selfie?

1031
01:02:44,227 --> 01:02:45,194
Oh yes.

1032
01:02:48,531 --> 01:02:51,398
Thank you Madam. How was the food?
Did you like it? - It was good.

1033
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,798
Hi Aishwarya.
- Hi.

1034
01:02:54,904 --> 01:02:57,031
Where's your new film's shooting?
- At Kochi.

1035
01:02:57,106 --> 01:02:58,937
I'm on my waythere.
Okay.

1036
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:27,402
What's wrong with you?

1037
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,482
No! Please.

1038
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:57,499
RoshH

1039
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,801
You bastard!

1040
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,947
Your grief will turn to joy.

1041
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,625
Sir, good morning.
- Today's headlines..

1042
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:25,150
We'll be there. Won't be late.
- Actress Aishwarya com mitted suicide.

1043
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:28,254
The actress was found dead
in herflat in Kochi.

1044
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:30,458
Tijojoins us from Kochi
with more informations.

1045
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,194
Tijo, has the police
started the investigation?

1046
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,636
What are the developments?

1047
01:04:33,636 --> 01:04:37,629
Prakash, a private video of the actress had
spread through social media yesterday

1048
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,975
No suicide notes
have been found yet.

1049
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,080
Prakash, actress Aishwarya's
marriage was fixed recently.

1050
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:53,445
Police also suspects that someone
leaked the video to cancel her wedding.

1051
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,922
The clipping was leaked
from a foreign SIM.

1052
01:04:57,026 --> 01:05:00,120
Related to the badminton league in which
Aishwarya was the brand ambassador,

1053
01:05:00,196 --> 01:05:02,289
and related to some
other financial deals,

1054
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:06,335
there had been arguments between famous
businessman Roshi Balachandran &Aishwarya.

1055
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,360
That is the latest information.

1056
01:05:08,537 --> 01:05:13,236
Salim, the talk that Mamalayur home guard's
case & the actress' suicide are related;

1057
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:14,469
how far is it true?

1058
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:16,408
Venu, Roshi Balachandran
is now under arrest

1059
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:19,539
in the case in which home guard
Sukumaran was killed in an accident.

1060
01:05:19,649 --> 01:05:23,380
It's said that this accident happened on
his way back afterthe badminton league;

1061
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:26,689
and thatAishwarya was also present
with Roshi during thatjourney.

1062
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,317
If so, we have to suspect that
home guard Sukumaran's accident

1063
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,985
and actress Aishwarya's
suicide are related.

1064
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:36,963
Anyway, this case will lead to more
controversies in the coming days, Venu.

1065
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:39,635
Madhu,

1066
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,663
collect his bank details.

1067
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:43,538
Salim.

1068
01:05:43,673 --> 01:05:46,375
That rascal leaked the info about
the secret statement to Roshi.

1069
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:47,342
Idiot.

1070
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,273
I knew that this would
put us in trouble.

1071
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,375
Do you think that Roshi
would stay silent now?

1072
01:05:51,547 --> 01:05:53,674
Like he killed that girl,
he'll do something to us too!

1073
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,315
For that, he has to
come out, right?

1074
01:05:55,384 --> 01:05:58,376
Or if he sends a video of yours like
this, will you also commit suicide?

1075
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:00,612
Roshi won't come out, Ranjith.

1076
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,486
I'm telling you, right?
- How, Swamy?

1077
01:06:03,559 --> 01:06:05,294
This lyer will leave
from here only after

1078
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:07,387
registering this accident
case as a murder case,

1079
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:08,724
at the Sessions Court.

1080
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,092
Didn't you talk about a dummy lawyer?
Who's that?

1081
01:06:11,167 --> 01:06:13,235
Someone who has the
courage to oppose Roshi,

1082
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:15,294
and someone who won't go
beyond what I say. A dummy!

1083
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,573
Along with the death of home
guard Sukumaran's death,

1084
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,939
actress Aishwarya's death is
also relevant in this case.

1085
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:25,346
Sir, will your client get bail?
- Can't say anything now.

1086
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,348
Let the trial be over.
Then I'll talk to you.

1087
01:06:27,416 --> 01:06:28,542
Please wait until then.

1088
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:34,987
Shiny, the accused is here.
Let's go to the visuals.

1089
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:39,084
Roshi, one minute.
- Move.

1090
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:40,626
Roshi, one minute.

1091
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:46,234
Give me the file.

1092
01:06:58,147 --> 01:06:59,409
Sumesh.

1093
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:03,642
CC 132I18.

1094
01:07:04,453 --> 01:07:05,420
Your Honour,

1095
01:07:05,654 --> 01:07:06,621
Whatdid you call me?

1096
01:07:06,722 --> 01:07:07,689
Your Honour?

1097
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,190
Or should I say 'My Lord' here?

1098
01:07:11,293 --> 01:07:13,386
No. 'Your Honour' is
more than enough.

1099
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:14,429
Okay.

1100
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:17,699
Sir, I am advocate Harihara Iyer.

1101
01:07:18,134 --> 01:07:21,194
M.A. LLB.
LLM from ILS, Pune.

1102
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:23,636
And Barrister at Law
from London Law School.

1103
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:25,040
Your Honour,

1104
01:07:25,274 --> 01:07:27,572
the case in question pertains to..
- Oh! Swamy!

1105
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:30,071
I can call you that, right?
- Sure.

1106
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:33,008
I know that you have fought
cases at the Supreme Court.

1107
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,416
I'm just a second class Magistrate.

1108
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,653
Sir, isn't this a First Class
Judicial Magistrate Court?

1109
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:39,722
Yes.

1110
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,623
But I was saying that in
English, I am only second class.

1111
01:07:43,826 --> 01:07:45,293
The court's language is English.

1112
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:47,652
But so that everyone
understands,

1113
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,324
if you could talk in
Malayalam, it would be great.

1114
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,500
Okay.

1115
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:52,801
I'll talk in Malayalam.

1116
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,371
Mr. Roshi,

1117
01:07:57,339 --> 01:08:00,103
if you could stand in there,
we can begin the proceedings.

1118
01:08:08,317 --> 01:08:10,444
I will say nothing butthe
truth, before the court.

1119
01:08:10,853 --> 01:08:13,083
I will say nothing butthe
truth, before the court.

1120
01:08:13,155 --> 01:08:14,122
Your Honour,

1121
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,619
In home guard Sukumaran's
accident case,

1122
01:08:18,227 --> 01:08:21,162
the memorandum of appearance that I
submitted in Roshi Balachandran's name,

1123
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,164
I am withdrawing that
before this court.

1124
01:08:24,867 --> 01:08:29,405
I humbly request this courtto avoid
me from the further proceedings.

1125
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:34,399
Still, I request permission to watch the
procedures of this case, as an audience;

1126
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,342
to the Honourable Court.

1127
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:38,771
Okay. Granted.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

1128
01:08:53,662 --> 01:09:00,659
A public interest suit against Roshi, has
been rejected due to the lack of witnesses.

1129
01:09:06,842 --> 01:09:09,777
Sir, there's another reason for me to
withdraw my memorandum of appearance.

1130
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,203
Considering the
seriousness ofthis case,

1131
01:09:12,281 --> 01:09:15,250
the district collector has
appointed a public prosecutor.

1132
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:20,422
A very experienced,

1133
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:23,550
and atalented, senior public
prosecutor has been appointed.

1134
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:28,695
He is from this town, and knew the deceased
Sukumaran and his family very well.

1135
01:09:32,401 --> 01:09:33,800
Who is that, Swamy?

1136
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:36,138
It's me.

1137
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:40,375
Doing good?

1138
01:09:40,442 --> 01:09:44,276
Is he the experienced and senior
advocate you were talking about?

1139
01:09:46,482 --> 01:09:47,949
Him?

1140
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,857
Don't worry at all, sir.

1141
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:00,291
lwill do great.

1142
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:03,262
Why should I worry, Rowdy?

1143
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,290
What's his actual name?

1144
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,698
Sir, Sundareshan Nadar.

1145
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:09,395
Sundareshan Nadar..
- Yes?

1146
01:10:09,638 --> 01:10:11,407
Whatever!
- So be it.

1147
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:12,806
Mr. Roshi Balachandran,

1148
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:16,902
on the next date, you should decide
who your lawyer is and file a reply.

1149
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:17,946
Sir..

1150
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,273
What is it, Advocate Binu?

1151
01:10:20,449 --> 01:10:23,441
I am appearing to plea for Mr.
Roshi Balachandran.

1152
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:25,453
What?

1153
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:26,822
When did that happen?

1154
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:27,948
I didn't know that.

1155
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:32,357
Advocate Binu Sebastian Choorezhan is
appearing for Mr. Roshi Balachandran

1156
01:10:54,516 --> 01:10:56,919
The memorandum of appearance
that Roshi has given in my name,

1157
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,320
and along with that,

1158
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:00,856
the request to grant bail
for my client in this case,

1159
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:02,790
I am submitting them
before the court.

1160
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:25,278
To subvert Mamalayur Home Guard Accident
case, advocate gets an offer of crores.

1161
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:28,417
He said that his client is not actress
Aishwarya, but Roshi Balachandran..

1162
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:32,376
To subvert Mamalayur Home Guard Accident
case, advocate gets an offer of Iakhs..

1163
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:33,887
An offer of crores.

1164
01:11:34,523 --> 01:11:37,515
Big money has been involved in
the Mamalayur accident case..

1165
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:41,427
Home Guard Association wants the
case to investigated by CBI.

1166
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:44,898
Did Advocate Binu Choorezhan
fall for the big money offered?

1167
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:49,872
As this case was subverted, will
actress Aishwarya's death be solved?

1168
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:51,703
Will the actress' family be served justice?

1169
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,949
You've learned short-hand
in typewriting, huh?

1170
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:10,088
G reat speed.

1171
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:12,394
You should be fast at
everything, right?

1172
01:12:12,461 --> 01:12:14,430
Cell No. 11 in the subjail.

1173
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,022
That's Roshi Sir's new address.

1174
01:12:16,632 --> 01:12:19,100
He's throwing away money
to get VIP treatment.

1175
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:20,863
Let him do what he wants.

1176
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:23,772
Magistrate has remanded
Roshi and given ustime,

1177
01:12:23,772 --> 01:12:25,399
to produce evidences.

1178
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:29,778
However smart a criminal may be,
some evidences may be left behind.

1179
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:31,302
And we need to find that.
- Yes.

1180
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,881
Or else his advocate.
What's the name of thatjoker?

1181
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,608
He's just a kid.
Binu Choorezhan.

1182
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:37,920
It's because you stopped me.

1183
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,718
Or else I'd have taken him in custody,
and taken his bloody statement.

1184
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:42,914
That won't stand in
court, Anirudhan sir.

1185
01:12:42,991 --> 01:12:44,860
Statement can be changed anytime.
- Ya ya.

1186
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:47,420
Evidence. That is valuable.
- Of course.

1187
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,132
And ya, have you prepared
the papers to be submitted?

1188
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:51,565
It's ready already.

1189
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:53,765
But I have a doubt.

1190
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:54,803
What doubt?

1191
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:57,497
Well, I have written
it in Malayalam.

1192
01:12:57,606 --> 01:12:58,698
English...

1193
01:12:58,807 --> 01:13:01,510
Hey Mini, is language an issue
for the representation?

1194
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:03,034
There's a Supreme Court
notification, sir.

1195
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:05,137
Regional languages are
allowed in lower courts.

1196
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:06,641
You can use Malayalam.

1197
01:13:07,449 --> 01:13:08,746
Then there's nothing to worry.

1198
01:13:08,917 --> 01:13:10,441
File this directly.

1199
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:14,523
Take 2 copies. Keep one in our
file and submit the other one.

1200
01:13:14,523 --> 01:13:15,490
Do as he said.

1201
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:17,722
Sir..
-What is it, Mini?

1202
01:13:17,926 --> 01:13:19,120
Can you read it once?

1203
01:13:19,194 --> 01:13:21,830
If it's about spelling mistakes,
correct them & submit it.

1204
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:22,797
Sir..

1205
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:28,737
What?

1206
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:31,028
Swamy, please read this.

1207
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,142
I'll read it out.

1208
01:13:34,443 --> 01:13:35,410
Problem solved, right?

1209
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:43,383
My dearest Magistrate Mr. Solomon
Mathew Puthanpalli sir;

1210
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:44,486
Namaste.

1211
01:13:44,753 --> 01:13:45,720
Are you doing good?

1212
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:47,119
How's the beginning?
-Amazing.

1213
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,589
I thought I'll start
by flattering him.

1214
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:50,817
He'll fall for this. Sure.

1215
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:56,152
A son of a @$$@% called Roshi
Balachandran.. - Rowdy!

1216
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:58,497
He deserves the cuss words.

1217
01:13:58,600 --> 01:13:59,862
He should hearthem.

1218
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:02,500
On the 12th ofthe Thula month,

1219
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:05,038
don't you know Raman Pillai, the
old postman from Thekkethil;

1220
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:09,477
His brother Sukumaran Pillai was killed by
running his car over him, sir. I swear!

1221
01:14:09,545 --> 01:14:10,477
Month ofThula?

1222
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:12,514
Then why don't you add the
star sign of that day?

1223
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:14,812
I have to find it out
from Manorama Calendar.

1224
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:23,422
Yours sincerely, with lots of love,
your own, Sundareshan LLB.

1225
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:24,581
Rowdy Advocate.

1226
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:26,855
That's my nickname.
Don't you know?

1227
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:29,528
This is trouble.

1228
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:31,556
Hey! Tell me the truth.

1229
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:33,198
Have you studied in law college?

1230
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:34,866
Why did you ask that, Swamy?

1231
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,597
You want to see my
degree certificate?

1232
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:38,933
So you've not prepared an
affidavit before this?

1233
01:14:39,041 --> 01:14:42,044
I'm notthat desperate to
sell anything to live.

1234
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:43,909
Not selling.
Affidavit.

1235
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,841
Have you never submitted an
affidavit in court earlier?

1236
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,177
Oh.
No.

1237
01:14:48,617 --> 01:14:50,107
The need never arose.

1238
01:14:50,185 --> 01:14:51,846
Why?
- Most of my cases,

1239
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,922
are arguments between
goons and theirfights.

1240
01:14:53,922 --> 01:14:56,823
Before reaching the court, I take
my fees and compromise them.

1241
01:14:57,125 --> 01:14:59,252
A case that went to court...

1242
01:14:59,528 --> 01:15:02,122
Around 3 years back, there was one.

1243
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:04,593
I made my client write it then.

1244
01:15:04,766 --> 01:15:06,535
My hand was broken then.

1245
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:07,934
I had gone to compromise a case.

1246
01:15:08,136 --> 01:15:10,604
Swamy, why can't you plead
this case yourself?

1247
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:14,033
Ifl appear against my own client, a
report will be sent from ethics committee.

1248
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,701
Bar council will throw me out.

1249
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:21,481
You shouldn't say anything at the court
that I haven't told you or written for you.

1250
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:24,049
If you increase or
decrease even a letter,

1251
01:15:24,219 --> 01:15:27,586
I'll throw you away without paying a
single penny & get a better lawyer.

1252
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,017
Don't be tensed, Swamy.

1253
01:15:29,658 --> 01:15:31,683
I will rock this!

1254
01:15:35,197 --> 01:15:36,164
It has ripened.

1255
01:15:36,965 --> 01:15:39,058
If we got 2 more, we
could have fried it.

1256
01:15:39,201 --> 01:15:40,634
Slice it and eat it raw.

1257
01:15:40,769 --> 01:15:42,134
At least the fat can be saved.

1258
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:46,273
Was there a calling
bell in this house?

1259
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:51,305
It's very ripe.

1260
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:52,814
Eat it.

1261
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,243
There's a problem only if an advocate
gifts the judge.

1262
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,080
The opposite is possible.
Have it.

1263
01:15:58,186 --> 01:15:59,153
Advocate Binu,

1264
01:16:00,022 --> 01:16:00,989
what's your intention?

1265
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:04,852
Didn't you yourself bring
that case against Roshi?

1266
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:08,855
Convincing with sentiments about your dad,
you made me take leave & sit at home;

1267
01:16:08,997 --> 01:16:11,158
and that famous person whom
you were about to bring here

1268
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:12,757
for a secret statement,
is dead now.

1269
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:14,699
Then why did you agree
to plead for him?

1270
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:15,895
For myself, sir.

1271
01:16:16,805 --> 01:16:18,898
I took LLB to become
a criminal lawyer.

1272
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:24,004
So whoever calls me offering money to fight
their case, I should appear, right sir?

1273
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:26,339
You have already
appeared for him, right?

1274
01:16:26,882 --> 01:16:28,941
As a criminal minded lawyer.

1275
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:30,985
Advocate Binu,

1276
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,149
this is an accident case.

1277
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:36,322
ltwill leave my hands only
after! see the end of it.

1278
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:41,359
Go, kneel down and pray at your
father's grave or before Jesus;

1279
01:16:41,763 --> 01:16:43,162
and come to the court, okay?

1280
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:44,866
Go.

1281
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:50,294
(Prayers being offered
at the Church)

1282
01:16:53,342 --> 01:16:56,334
He came here to attend the retreat,
on the 2nd day after the incident.

1283
01:16:56,878 --> 01:16:58,709
Either fear,
or guilt.

1284
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,139
It's sure that he
has seen something.

1285
01:17:11,226 --> 01:17:12,853
- There's an announcement.

1286
01:17:13,695 --> 01:17:17,187
-All the believers who are
here to attend the retreat,

1287
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,791
- Should return only after
attending the feast.

1288
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,031
Sir, he is coming.

1289
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:56,962
Did you notice the number
ofthe carthat hit him?

1290
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:58,903
I was a little away
when it hit him.

1291
01:17:59,074 --> 01:18:00,769
So I couldn't notice the number.

1292
01:18:02,244 --> 01:18:04,178
But the car's colourwas red.

1293
01:18:05,113 --> 01:18:06,774
The one who was driving,

1294
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:11,049
While opening the door, he
was wearing a yellow shirt.

1295
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:14,384
Roshi was going afterthe badminton
match from the resort at Meghamala;

1296
01:18:15,157 --> 01:18:19,253
to Kochi via Mamalayur in his own
car which was red in colour,

1297
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:23,094
And the shirt that he wore on
that day was light yellow;

1298
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,292
It's very clearfrom the photos that
were taken during that programme.

1299
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:32,772
Export.. Sheesh.. Exhibition P3, P4..
- Exhibition?

1300
01:18:32,974 --> 01:18:34,669
Then tell me which circus as well.

1301
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,141
Exhibit P3, P4.
Exhibit.

1302
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:40,475
Exhibit P3, P4.

1303
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:48,046
Please give this to him.

1304
01:18:50,192 --> 01:18:52,456
Sir, this is the statement
of the eye-witness.

1305
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,285
Enough?
Or do you want more?

1306
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,022
Sir, this bloody..
- Rowdy!

1307
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,731
Sir, this bearded guy should
be hanged to death, sir.

1308
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:04,840
If you want to decide everything,
shall I go home?

1309
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:05,841
Not like that, sir.

1310
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:09,800
Have you heard of something
called cross-examination?

1311
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:11,445
Yes.
- Then please go.

1312
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,944
If you want to ask something, ask.
-Advocate Binu..

1313
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:24,052
Why didn't you tell the police about
this earlier, Anthony Chettan?

1314
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,384
I was scared whether I
would be in trouble.

1315
01:19:27,028 --> 01:19:28,359
I come from a poor
& needy family.

1316
01:19:28,497 --> 01:19:31,330
So to confess now, did anyone
fulfil all your needs?

1317
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:33,869
Yes.
He won 'Karunya' lottery.

1318
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:34,836
Why do you care?

1319
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,538
Not that.

1320
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,802
God gave me courage to confess it now.
That's all.

1321
01:19:38,874 --> 01:19:40,307
According to the
postmortem report,

1322
01:19:40,575 --> 01:19:43,305
Sukumaran died between
9 PM and 9.30 PM.

1323
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,336
How come you were
there at that time?

1324
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:47,539
You close your shop only
after 12 AM, right?

1325
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:49,340
Since I thought I was
getting a fever,

1326
01:19:49,818 --> 01:19:51,979
I left early, leaving my
brotherto run the shop.

1327
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:53,054
Then"

1328
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:56,290
If I take the hospital
turning, my house is close by.

1329
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:57,558
I can reach fast.

1330
01:19:57,859 --> 01:19:59,451
Sir, understood?

1331
01:19:59,961 --> 01:20:02,395
The way behind our
MountZion hospital.

1332
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:06,401
The liquor shop from Pallikkara was
shifted to a place near his house.

1333
01:20:06,401 --> 01:20:08,892
You notice it regularly while
standing in the queue, right?

1334
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,200
So sad! Sit down, man!

1335
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:14,937
Do you have anything more to ask?
- Yes sir.

1336
01:20:16,411 --> 01:20:17,378
Anthony Chetta,

1337
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:22,507
So you saw someone in a yellow shirt,
driving a red car, hitting someone else.

1338
01:20:22,584 --> 01:20:23,852
Right?
- Yes.

1339
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:25,479
You use spectacles, right?
- Yes.

1340
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:28,389
This is just for myopia.

1341
01:20:29,024 --> 01:20:30,355
I have trouble only in reading.

1342
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:31,890
You can check if you want to.

1343
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:37,993
Sir, you are brilliant.

1344
01:20:38,099 --> 01:20:40,465
You had predicted that he
would ask this question.

1345
01:20:43,238 --> 01:20:44,500
Okay.
I'm convinced.

1346
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:48,109
Since the defence counsel is convinced,
based on the witness statement,

1347
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:49,542
But I haven't
finished questioning.

1348
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:50,877
Please sit down.

1349
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:59,910
If he had said that he saw some car driven
by someone, Iwould have been in afix.

1350
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,022
That means?

1351
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:02,958
When you went to get
treated for myopia,

1352
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:05,256
didn't the doctor say that
your eyes had another problem?

1353
01:21:09,564 --> 01:21:11,930
Since he didn't trust the
Government doctor enough,

1354
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:14,432
he went to a private eye
care in Kottayam as well.

1355
01:21:17,239 --> 01:21:19,407
and does not interrupt any
of your daily activities,

1356
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:22,344
Even that doctor certified that
there's such a problem for your eyes.

1357
01:21:22,344 --> 01:21:23,538
Isn't that true?
- Hey! Hey!

1358
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:24,645
Come to the point.

1359
01:21:27,015 --> 01:21:32,120
The final diagnosis after conducting the
enchroma test of Mr. Anthony Xavier (58),

1360
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:37,114
confirms total dichromacy of the left eye
and anomalous trichromacy of the right eye.

1361
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:38,960
Hey! Hey!

1362
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:40,953
Calm down, man.

1363
01:21:41,496 --> 01:21:43,498
There are other people
here to talk in English.

1364
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:44,465
Sundareshan,

1365
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,934
if you talk in between again,

1366
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:48,469
this is not here for carpentry.

1367
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,128
I'll whack you with this!

1368
01:21:52,941 --> 01:21:57,275
Binu sir, if you explain things clearly
in Malayalam, everyone will understand.

1369
01:21:57,345 --> 01:21:59,939
Sir, the disease mentioned
here is colour blindness.

1370
01:22:00,115 --> 01:22:05,086
That means, a condition ofthe eye that
can't differentiate between yellow or red.

1371
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:06,246
That's jaundice, you fool!

1372
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:07,622
Rowdy!

1373
01:22:10,191 --> 01:22:13,058
Sir, someone who can't
even see things properly;

1374
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:17,899
That's awesome.

1375
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:20,925
My client is rich.

1376
01:22:21,269 --> 01:22:22,497
He's a famous person.

1377
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:25,996
He was in this area on the
day the accident happened.

1378
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:27,232
So he's the one who hit him!

1379
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:31,208
This is the mindset of the media
which is running behind sensations.

1380
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:35,983
I'm sure that someone like you who has high
respect for the law & great knowledge,

1381
01:22:36,051 --> 01:22:37,575
would neverthink like that.

1382
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:38,653
ButAdvocate Binu,

1383
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:42,250
it hasn't been proved that it
wasn't your client who hit him.

1384
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:46,421
If you can't prove that, I'll
order further investigation,

1385
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:48,063
and send the case to Sessions.

1386
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:49,530
I'll sort it on the next date, sir.

1387
01:22:49,998 --> 01:22:51,192
I'll fix it on the 8th.

1388
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,130
One week?
Why is that?

1389
01:22:54,102 --> 01:22:55,933
He'll bring all the
evidence in 2 days.

1390
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:57,198
Fix it on the day
after tomorrow.

1391
01:22:58,573 --> 01:22:59,540

'

 shift it.

1392
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:02,206
I'll shift it from the 8th.

1393
01:23:02,677 --> 01:23:06,135
The case has been
postponed to 18th.

1394
01:23:06,214 --> 01:23:07,647
Take him away!

1395
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,388
Are you happy now that you
irritated him unnecessarily?

1396
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:14,514
Get lost!
- Come!

1397
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:22,630
You should have done your
homework properly, Mini.

1398
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,224
You presented him in court without
knowing that he had such a problem?

1399
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,530
She has come without doing any homework.
Little devil.

1400
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:30,101
Sorry sir.
- Sir, what do we do now?

1401
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:31,238
Carry on, Swamy.

1402
01:23:31,573 --> 01:23:32,540
Start the car.

1403
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:38,070
Sir, I'll come later.
I have to appearfor a rape case.

1404
01:23:41,449 --> 01:23:43,314
You still have a black
& white TV at home?

1405
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,215
No.
Colour TV.

1406
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,354
What the..

1407
01:23:46,454 --> 01:23:48,422
Colour TV?
Loseﬂ

1408
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,521
Your plea today was awesome.

1409
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:55,087
Even though you're so intelligent,
you took 3 years to pass 10th grade?

1410
01:23:55,597 --> 01:23:58,691
Many ofthose who have reached great
heights, had failed in 10th grade.

1411
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,001
Even Sachin Tendulkar had
failed in 10th grade.

1412
01:24:01,302 --> 01:24:04,172
That's true. I had failed
in 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th.

1413
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:06,037
But I passed 10th grade
in my first attempt.

1414
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,439
By copying. - Maybe that's why
you can't come up in life.

1415
01:24:10,478 --> 01:24:12,139
Where are you going, Pappettan?
Come!

1416
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:13,247
It's his treat today.

1417
01:24:13,348 --> 01:24:15,316
Did you see his performance
in the court today?

1418
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:16,442
I am in a hurry.

1419
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:17,818
To booze, right?

1420
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:22,457
We'll go together and drink
after having Dosas.

1421
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:23,424
Don't go, Pappetta.

1422
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,424
You got something to write about
me in the papertomorrow, right?

1423
01:24:26,661 --> 01:24:27,628
What to write?

1424
01:24:28,329 --> 01:24:30,661
Do you think you did something
great at the court today?

1425
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,758
He's offering a treat to me!

1426
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:34,402
Why are you talking like this?

1427
01:24:34,402 --> 01:24:36,393
He will give a treat, Pappettan.
See this.

1428
01:24:36,538 --> 01:24:39,837
Have you seen a cheque of such a high
amount, except with Suresh Gopi on TV?

1429
01:24:40,141 --> 01:24:41,335
Look! Look!
- Move!

1430
01:24:42,210 --> 01:24:45,313
Binu, I've been with you for
many of your crooked plans.

1431
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:47,781
But this is not like that.
Aishwarya was a client whom I brought.

1432
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,283
You tell me onething.

1433
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:52,218
Did he threaten you
to accept this case?

1434
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,311
Or did he offeryou
crores as remuneration?

1435
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:55,855
There's nothing like that, Pappettan.

1436
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:58,091
When he heard that Swamy
would cheat him,

1437
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:00,855
Roshi wanted to give it back to him,
with a Iawyerfrom this court itself.

1438
01:25:01,129 --> 01:25:02,460
Because of my luck, he chose me.

1439
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:05,761
ls accepting the case of the one who killed
your own client called luck, you dog?

1440
01:25:08,236 --> 01:25:09,533
They will pay money if
he fights the case.

1441
01:25:09,604 --> 01:25:12,266
And we will drink with that
money and not him, right?

1442
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:14,171
Move away! You &
your recommendation.

1443
01:25:14,509 --> 01:25:15,476
Binu,

1444
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,674
you have a sister at home.

1445
01:25:18,713 --> 01:25:20,112
Don't forget that.

1446
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:22,283
Pappetta!

1447
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:25,114
Let him go!

1448
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:26,548
I'll get your sister married,

1449
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:27,755
with my brother.

1450
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:30,189
What is this?
This is my word!

1451
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:31,859
Scoundrel.

1452
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:45,773
Mom!

1453
01:25:46,741 --> 01:25:47,708
Chechi!
(Sister)

1454
01:26:07,328 --> 01:26:08,625
Sir got scared.

1455
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:12,657
Lil' lawyer got scared.

1456
01:26:39,594 --> 01:26:42,358
You needn't have come here, grandma.
I would've brought it there.

1457
01:26:43,331 --> 01:26:45,561
Grandma, did you have cake?
- Yes.

1458
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:49,267
This was a huge surprise.

1459
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:50,838
Did you like it?

1460
01:26:51,906 --> 01:26:54,272
Chechi is really happy.
Didn't you see?

1461
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:55,876
Thanks a lot.

1462
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:59,870
We should be saying thanks for being
called to the house of such a big lawyer,

1463
01:26:59,981 --> 01:27:01,278
whose name comes on the papers.

1464
01:27:01,816 --> 01:27:04,580
The papers aren't writing good
things about this lawyer.

1465
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:08,951
Do you thinkthat I wasn't
right in accepting this case?

1466
01:27:11,492 --> 01:27:14,461
Home guard Sukumaran Chettan's
daughter Lakshmi was my classmate.

1467
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:21,264
So, Iwould've been happy if all
the people I liked, were together.

1468
01:27:24,739 --> 01:27:26,798
Dad has started his concert.
Let me go there.

1469
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:33,877
Sub jail
Mamalayur.

1470
01:27:34,015 --> 01:27:36,210
You want to change its name?
Get down.

1471
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,819
This bloody knot.

1472
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:41,982
What are you staring at?
Come.

1473
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:43,554
Have you been to
the jail earlier?

1474
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:44,658
Are you scared?

1475
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,694
No. Just a little.

1476
01:27:46,694 --> 01:27:49,254
Firsttime I'm handling such a case.
- Why should you be scared?

1477
01:27:49,497 --> 01:27:52,989
For clerks and lawyers who
live depending on them;

1478
01:27:53,268 --> 01:27:55,828
the jail is like a temple. Do you know?
- Ya right.

1479
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:58,598
The Holy doorthat opens
when you knock.

1480
01:28:03,745 --> 01:28:05,975
If you bend your head and
enter for the sight,

1481
01:28:06,414 --> 01:28:08,644
a clergyman whom you know.
Doing good? - Yes.

1482
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:10,511
As long as this devotee is here,

1483
01:28:10,585 --> 01:28:12,985
you won't have any problem
here in this temple. Go!

1484
01:28:14,355 --> 01:28:16,550
Sura, you didn't get out yet?
- Mani!

1485
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:24,564
Why did you want
to meet me, sir?

1486
01:28:24,632 --> 01:28:26,998
What's the status?
Will I get bail on the next date?

1487
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:28,563
Definitely!

1488
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:32,370
Why did you say that?

1489
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:34,839
What did you think ofthat Swamy?

1490
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:38,311
He has found out a
new eye-witness.

1491
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:39,747
Eye-witness?

1492
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:43,777
You mean a camera or
something like that?

1493
01:28:43,851 --> 01:28:45,876
Notjust any camera.
A CCTV camera.

1494
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:49,422
It's on top of the back gate
ofthat MountZion hospital.

1495
01:28:49,524 --> 01:28:50,718
I didn't see itthen.

1496
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:53,361
Don't know if it's because
they got a culprit,

1497
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:55,488
the police who investigated
then also didn't find it.

1498
01:28:55,596 --> 01:28:57,029
But we heard that
it's still there.

1499
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:58,429
Both them and me.

1500
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:01,731
That CI has kept a copy of
that recording with him.

1501
01:29:01,869 --> 01:29:05,100
The original will be on the
hospital hard disk? - Is it?

1502
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,307
Is it?

1503
01:29:06,374 --> 01:29:09,002
You should be finding all
this and telling me.

1504
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:10,942
I found this out by
staying in here.

1505
01:29:11,412 --> 01:29:12,936
So what the hell are you doing?

1506
01:29:13,614 --> 01:29:15,775
You don't understand
my frustration.

1507
01:29:16,484 --> 01:29:19,020
The street food vendor whom they brought.
You proved him wrong.

1508
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:20,419
Good job.
All cool.

1509
01:29:20,822 --> 01:29:22,949
But what's the point?
I'm still stuck in here.

1510
01:29:23,891 --> 01:29:25,882
They're not sending
it to a higher court!

1511
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:27,855
They're going on
postponing the case..

1512
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:31,890
When I expect to get bail any moment and
come back without getting anything,

1513
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:35,595
some ofthese monkeys and
third rate pimps and a@$@% S..

1514
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:39,831
When I see their mocking laughs,
I'm frickin' going mad!

1515
01:29:41,609 --> 01:29:43,076
When Swamy turned
to the other side,

1516
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:47,411
it was not like I didn't know to bring
lawyers practising in Supreme Court.

1517
01:29:47,849 --> 01:29:49,578
To take her secret statement,

1518
01:29:49,650 --> 01:29:52,778
and to make a Magistrate take
2 days leave and sit at home,

1519
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:54,752
when there's someone
here who could do that,

1520
01:29:54,822 --> 01:29:58,986
I wanted to get back to Swamy with
you, and gavethisjob to you.

1521
01:30:00,027 --> 01:30:03,463
If that CD reaches
the court somehow..

1522
01:30:03,698 --> 01:30:04,665
It won't.

1523
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:07,960
You might have to spend
quite a lot of money.

1524
01:30:08,169 --> 01:30:10,103
But the CD won't
reach the court.

1525
01:30:10,671 --> 01:30:13,003
Even the original at the
hospital will be erased.

1526
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:19,080
Is it paining too much, Mani?

1527
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,707
You could have told
the Superintendent.

1528
01:30:20,782 --> 01:30:21,749
What happened?

1529
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:24,141
Have you removed your shirt
because it's a temple?

1530
01:30:24,519 --> 01:30:25,486
I didn't remove it.

1531
01:30:25,620 --> 01:30:26,917
I was made to remove it.

1532
01:30:27,054 --> 01:30:28,487
The Superintendent is new.

1533
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:29,924
He manhandled him thinking that

1534
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:32,154
he's some accused who didn't
get back to cell on time.

1535
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,156
So you made an offering
to the temple as well.

1536
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:35,622
The devotee is happy now?

1537
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,489
Come. He listens as
soon as you call him.

1538
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:41,029
Ya. To hit me on my spine!

1539
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:54,848
I'll get choked by
this and die one day.

1540
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:30,111
Oh my God!

1541
01:31:30,485 --> 01:31:31,452
Hey!

1542
01:31:33,087 --> 01:31:35,180
Why are you lying here?
- Don't worry anymore.

1543
01:31:35,756 --> 01:31:37,018
Igot the stuff.

1544
01:31:37,091 --> 01:31:39,719
You idiot. This is the camera.
No point taking this.

1545
01:31:39,794 --> 01:31:41,819
It's on the hard disk
in the hospital.

1546
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:42,863
Oops.

1547
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:44,526
That we'll buy from outside.

1548
01:31:44,732 --> 01:31:45,699
Ican't climb again.

1549
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:46,834
Come!

1550
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:56,475
Sir, the CCTV at the front
gate is not working.

1551
01:31:56,577 --> 01:31:57,544
Let me go check.

1552
01:31:58,779 --> 01:31:59,746
Are we in trouble?

1553
01:31:59,947 --> 01:32:01,175
He might have seen you.

1554
01:32:38,352 --> 01:32:40,115
Stop sleeping and
get up, you hag!

1555
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:45,853
Oh no!
My chain!

1556
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,621
Oh no! My chain!

1557
01:32:47,728 --> 01:32:48,695
Stop there.
Catch him.

1558
01:32:48,863 --> 01:32:50,626
Sir, he stole my chain.

1559
01:32:51,165 --> 01:32:53,133
Catch him!
Thief!

1560
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:55,835
Come.

1561
01:32:58,072 --> 01:32:59,266
Hey thief! Stop there.

1562
01:32:59,340 --> 01:33:01,331
As ifthethief is going
to stop if you tell him to.

1563
01:33:04,378 --> 01:33:06,676
Stand here itself.
- What's wrong if! sit?

1564
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:09,343
It's been long since I read the paper.

1565
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:52,323
Oh God!

1566
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:10,939
Don't run.
I'll hit you.

1567
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:13,346
Catch him, sir.
My chain.

1568
01:34:16,384 --> 01:34:18,113
Not me, sir.
Catch him!

1569
01:34:18,219 --> 01:34:19,345
He's going there.
- Don't run.

1570
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:21,183
Catch him, sir.

1571
01:34:21,889 --> 01:34:23,720
Move.
Don't run, I say.

1572
01:34:23,958 --> 01:34:26,256
Catch him, sir.

1573
01:34:26,327 --> 01:34:27,885
Stop there.
Don't run.

1574
01:34:27,962 --> 01:34:28,929
Don't run.

1575
01:34:30,998 --> 01:34:31,965
Come here.
- What?

1576
01:34:32,933 --> 01:34:34,059
What do you want?

1577
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:36,261
Why are you hitting me?

1578
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:38,930
I haven't taken any chain.

1579
01:34:39,273 --> 01:34:41,434
Is this the chain?
- That's my chain, sir.

1580
01:34:41,709 --> 01:34:43,040
Please take it for me, sir.

1581
01:34:43,144 --> 01:34:44,873
It's my chain, sir.
- Your chain, right?

1582
01:34:44,945 --> 01:34:46,313
Then pick it up yourself.
- Leave me.

1583
01:34:46,313 --> 01:34:48,042
You don't take it.
I'll pick it up.

1584
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:50,175
Is this your chain?
- Yes.

1585
01:34:50,284 --> 01:34:51,842
Keep it.
Be careful.

1586
01:34:51,952 --> 01:34:53,112
You!
Bloody thief!

1587
01:34:53,220 --> 01:34:54,388
No need to say thanks.

1588
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:56,356
Shall we go, sir?
- Joking around?

1589
01:35:45,439 --> 01:35:46,406
Bag!

1590
01:35:48,976 --> 01:35:50,170
It's in the bag.

1591
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:51,945
Bag?

1592
01:35:57,752 --> 01:35:59,344
It's raining so hard.
- Let's go, sir.

1593
01:36:00,187 --> 01:36:01,950
Wait. Let the rain stop.

1594
01:36:04,391 --> 01:36:06,325
This rain won't stop, sir.
Let's go.

1595
01:36:14,135 --> 01:36:16,296
Cl's bag.
On his shoulder.

1596
01:36:19,874 --> 01:36:20,966
That's Anirudhan sir.

1597
01:36:21,075 --> 01:36:22,474
He helps people a lot.

1598
01:36:22,543 --> 01:36:25,376
Salute him giving all your details.
He'll help you. I'm telling you.

1599
01:36:25,513 --> 01:36:26,537
Come.
- Okay. I'll meet him.

1600
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:32,846
I'm civil police officer Babukkuttan
from Pattazhi station, sir.

1601
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:35,788
I came as escort for the accused
in a chain snatching case.

1602
01:36:35,856 --> 01:36:38,154
And sir, I've got good
service entry thrice.

1603
01:36:38,325 --> 01:36:40,816
lwas the band master in the
last independence day parade.

1604
01:36:41,228 --> 01:36:43,059
I got a medal forthat too, sir.

1605
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:46,790
I was also in the Kathiroor temple
robbery case investigation team.

1606
01:36:47,234 --> 01:36:50,971
CI Shashankan sir says that I'm an expert
in finding clues in robbery cases.

1607
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:52,802
Okay.
You carry on.

1608
01:37:08,422 --> 01:37:10,424
I got in seeing my
umbrella walking away.

1609
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:12,483
I took it when I needed it urgently. Sorry.
I'll drop you.

1610
01:37:17,364 --> 01:37:18,331
Good job.

1611
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:20,466
The message from the bank will come.

1612
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:32,069
You're a Circle Inspector, right?

1613
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:34,976
You lost the most important
evidence of this case.

1614
01:37:36,183 --> 01:37:38,310
Those who were on hospital
duty were even better.

1615
01:37:38,452 --> 01:37:41,319
How can we take this case forward
without that hard disk or CD?

1616
01:37:41,555 --> 01:37:42,954
Why are you worrying, Swamy?

1617
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:44,388
Just make a pirated CD.

1618
01:37:44,525 --> 01:37:46,220
You bloody..
- Isn't that enough?

1619
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:48,088
Shall we all give our statements?

1620
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:49,964
Roshi told everything that
happened to us, right?

1621
01:37:49,964 --> 01:37:51,465
Ranjith, one ofthat
will stand in court.

1622
01:37:51,465 --> 01:37:54,525
I've never said that, and they're saying
this deliberately to steal my money;

1623
01:37:54,635 --> 01:37:56,432
What if Roshi says that in court?

1624
01:37:57,004 --> 01:37:59,939
Or thatjoker would make Roshi say it.
- That's true.

1625
01:38:05,346 --> 01:38:07,109
He's not a joker.

1626
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:10,918
Where is this switch?

1627
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:13,045
Should we get inside
this and wash clothes?

1628
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:14,287
Sheesh.

1629
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:16,480
Hey! This is the verse I picked today.

1630
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:17,955
Look.

1631
01:38:18,425 --> 01:38:21,485
You're able to do all this
because of God's grace,

1632
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:24,190
and your father's
soul's blessings.

1633
01:38:25,666 --> 01:38:26,963
This isa sign.

1634
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:29,399
On the day of
commemoration festival,

1635
01:38:29,470 --> 01:38:31,301
we should go to Poondi
Church and pray.

1636
01:38:32,006 --> 01:38:32,973
To Poondi Church?

1637
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,132
Ya. Why not?

1638
01:38:34,475 --> 01:38:38,445
We should pray for the souls
of yourfather and his family.

1639
01:38:38,445 --> 01:38:39,412
Mom, that...

1640
01:38:39,713 --> 01:38:41,237
Don't say anything further..

1641
01:38:41,348 --> 01:38:42,315
Wow.

1642
01:38:44,451 --> 01:38:45,452
Look!

1643
01:38:45,452 --> 01:38:46,885
It has started.

1644
01:38:46,987 --> 01:38:47,976
This is also a sign.

1645
01:38:48,522 --> 01:38:51,923
So we're going to Poondi Church
for the commemoration festival.

1646
01:38:52,026 --> 01:38:53,516
He's trying to act smart with me.

1647
01:38:53,694 --> 01:38:54,661
What is this?

1648
01:38:56,196 --> 01:38:57,322
My Lord!

1649
01:38:57,698 --> 01:38:59,666
Such a wonder!
- Great!

1650
01:39:06,373 --> 01:39:07,340
Sumesh.

1651
01:39:08,208 --> 01:39:10,199
CC 132I18

1652
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:13,140
Sir, how can they
present someone

1653
01:39:13,213 --> 01:39:15,616
who's not in the list of
witnesses submitted in court,

1654
01:39:15,616 --> 01:39:18,016
without even giving
a prior notice?

1655
01:39:18,352 --> 01:39:19,910
Sir, it is to rectify the statement.

1656
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:22,479
It's a person who is on the
list of witnesses, sir.

1657
01:39:22,556 --> 01:39:25,392
When the investigation went to get
the statement, he couldn't do it.

1658
01:39:25,392 --> 01:39:26,359
Why?

1659
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:29,324
The witness had
conjunctivitis then.

1660
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:31,364
Would you go and get the statement then?
- Hey!

1661
01:39:32,433 --> 01:39:36,199
If the person is on the list, statement
rectification can be allowed.

1662
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,665
This is the list of people whom the
investigation went to get statements from.

1663
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:44,169
This has already been
submitted in court.

1664
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:45,575
I can submit it
again if you want.

1665
01:39:46,113 --> 01:39:48,013
Doesn't cost anything to submit it.

1666
01:39:53,454 --> 01:39:56,218
Here. You also keep a copy.
You can boil & eat it.

1667
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:00,959
Oh God!

1668
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:32,648
I will say nothing butthe
truth, before the court.

1669
01:40:32,826 --> 01:40:35,420
I will say nothing butthe
truth, before the court.

1670
01:40:37,297 --> 01:40:38,465
What do you have to say?

1671
01:40:38,465 --> 01:40:41,332
Sir, this poor girl's father was
killed in the middle of the road..

1672
01:40:42,302 --> 01:40:43,667
I went a little overboard.

1673
01:40:44,238 --> 01:40:49,266
This case progressed so far under the
condition that you didn't have a complaint.

1674
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:50,741
After staying away for so long,

1675
01:40:50,844 --> 01:40:53,074
what have you come to
say in the court now?

1676
01:40:53,147 --> 01:40:54,774
Even now we don't want
to fight the case, sir.

1677
01:40:55,315 --> 01:40:56,805
Advocate Binu Sebastian had visited us

1678
01:40:57,051 --> 01:40:59,286
saying that he'll get us justice
for ourfather's death,

1679
01:40:59,286 --> 01:41:01,277
and that we should file a case.

1680
01:41:01,488 --> 01:41:06,357
And today he is here as the advocate of the
person he named as my father's killer.

1681
01:41:08,462 --> 01:41:11,260
Someone claiming to be his
manager also came to see us.

1682
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:15,831
He asked us not to file a case and that
he can help us financially.

1683
01:41:16,236 --> 01:41:18,363
He had called us on the phone
a couple oftimes as well.

1684
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:21,104
I came here to say
all this here, sir.

1685
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:23,105
The one who met them,
and who called later;

1686
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:26,112
was Roshi's company's general
manager Madhusoodanan K.

1687
01:41:26,547 --> 01:41:31,746
I'm submitting auto driver Prashant's
identification & other phone number details.

1688
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:42,759
Binu sir, you want to cross?

1689
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,233
Then step down.

1690
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:54,207
Lakshmi..

1691
01:41:57,277 --> 01:42:00,178
This is evidence, Sundareshan.

1692
01:42:01,215 --> 01:42:02,182
Accepting it.

1693
01:42:03,383 --> 01:42:05,146
Let me fix another date.

1694
01:42:06,487 --> 01:42:08,455
I have to fix it after
another holiday.

1695
01:42:09,456 --> 01:42:11,185

'

 fix it on 28th.

1696
01:42:40,687 --> 01:42:41,654
Binu sir.

1697
01:42:53,834 --> 01:42:54,801
Hey Binu!

1698
01:43:09,716 --> 01:43:13,345
Did you say that you had to
win a great case or lose one?

1699
01:43:13,487 --> 01:43:14,954
Sorry.
I forgot.

1700
01:43:17,291 --> 01:43:19,493
Is the Supreme Court
lawyer satisfied now?

1701
01:43:19,493 --> 01:43:21,723
He had just one drink.
How will he be satisfied then?

1702
01:43:21,929 --> 01:43:24,295
Pappettan, stop
irritating and get going.

1703
01:43:25,966 --> 01:43:27,456
But I am satisfied now.

1704
01:43:27,935 --> 01:43:29,903
I am really happy today.

1705
01:43:33,974 --> 01:43:36,374
That Sukumaran's daughter
came and shocked you, right?

1706
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:40,846
It was me who convinced her
and brought herthere.

1707
01:43:41,815 --> 01:43:46,582
The crooked concoction that you
brewed to save your employer;

1708
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:49,389
she poured right into
yourthroat, right?

1709
01:43:49,389 --> 01:43:51,357
Binu, come.
Let's go.

1710
01:43:51,491 --> 01:43:52,458
Sit there.

1711
01:43:52,693 --> 01:43:53,860
Listen to this and go.

1712
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:55,953
Your client will
never get bail, man.

1713
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:59,291
Magistrate will orderfor
further investigation.

1714
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:03,432
That Swamy & CI are just waiting
to get Roshi in their hands.

1715
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:06,833
Even if he says something or
not, he's sure to get thulped.

1716
01:44:07,741 --> 01:44:09,675
Afterthatwhen he
is brought to court,

1717
01:44:09,776 --> 01:44:13,678
Magistrate will give him,
Section 338,

1718
01:44:13,814 --> 01:44:16,942
death caused due
to rash driving.

1719
01:44:17,584 --> 01:44:24,387
However it goes, your dear boss will
be behind bars for4 years minimum.

1720
01:44:24,491 --> 01:44:25,458
That's for sure.

1721
01:44:25,692 --> 01:44:27,455
4 years?
- Yes.

1722
01:44:27,861 --> 01:44:29,351
4 years.

1723
01:44:29,563 --> 01:44:30,530
Not in subjail.

1724
01:44:30,731 --> 01:44:32,358
In central jail.

1725
01:44:33,700 --> 01:44:36,692
That bloody @$!%%@% who killed 2 people
should be in jail only for4 years?

1726
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:38,701
You were quoting sections, right?
Tell me!

1727
01:44:40,874 --> 01:44:41,841
Tell me.

1728
01:44:43,510 --> 01:44:44,477
Oops.

1729
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:48,377
That's true.
Then why should we pay GST?

1730
01:44:48,915 --> 01:44:50,849
You needn't pay, man!
Sit down.

1731
01:44:51,885 --> 01:44:55,321
My dear Pappan, I didn't see
Sukumaran Pillai getting killed.

1732
01:44:56,757 --> 01:45:00,056
I didn't leave the shop with anyone, and I
don't have any such disease in my eyes.

1733
01:45:00,494 --> 01:45:02,860
This Binu made me say all that.

1734
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:05,891
Why are you looking like this?

1735
01:45:06,600 --> 01:45:09,865
Don't you always say that
I have a crooked mind?

1736
01:45:10,737 --> 01:45:13,865
If he goes and says that he'll be a
witness, that Swamy won't trust him.

1737
01:45:14,775 --> 01:45:15,742
That's why,

1738
01:45:16,109 --> 01:45:18,873
I sentAnthony Chettan talking
about retreat centre & guilt.

1739
01:45:19,546 --> 01:45:21,537
Do you know when he
offered this case to me?

1740
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:24,375
On the day of actress
Aishwarya's postmortem.

1741
01:45:25,619 --> 01:45:27,484
I wanted to curse him badly.

1742
01:45:28,922 --> 01:45:30,389
Then when I thought about it,

1743
01:45:31,491 --> 01:45:32,981
I thought I should play a game.

1744
01:45:33,827 --> 01:45:36,318
So when Anthony Chettan
became a witness for them,

1745
01:45:36,630 --> 01:45:40,293
I had a reason to get money from
Roshi, quoting colour blindness.

1746
01:45:41,001 --> 01:45:44,835
I made him frustrated to the maximum, saying
that he'll get bail today ortomorrow.

1747
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,996
And like Pappettan
said that day,

1748
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:48,909
without going to another advocate,

1749
01:45:48,909 --> 01:45:52,640
I would have gone to district court,
high court and even the Supreme Court.

1750
01:45:53,513 --> 01:45:56,448
Iwould have cornered him to a
situation where he'd want to just die,

1751
01:45:56,516 --> 01:45:57,813
instead of getting a bail.

1752
01:45:57,918 --> 01:45:59,442
But Binu.. I ..

1753
01:45:59,953 --> 01:46:03,480
I've been paid handsomely by
him during every holiday.

1754
01:46:03,757 --> 01:46:04,951
I took one share from that.

1755
01:46:05,726 --> 01:46:06,693
And the rest,

1756
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:09,029
a scholarship through
Home Guard trust,

1757
01:46:09,029 --> 01:46:10,963
which
doesn't even have 1000 Rupees with them;

1758
01:46:11,131 --> 01:46:15,397
Sukumaran's 2 children are going to
studytill college with Roshi's money.

1759
01:46:16,470 --> 01:46:18,802
The documents oftheir house &
property have been reclaimed.

1760
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:21,464
There's enough jewellery to get
at least one daughter married.

1761
01:46:21,608 --> 01:46:22,575
Right, Advocate Binu?

1762
01:46:25,512 --> 01:46:27,070
And you're saying
all this now, Binu?

1763
01:46:28,515 --> 01:46:31,109
It was a dangerous game
that even I wasn't sure of.

1764
01:46:31,685 --> 01:46:34,654
I didn't want to put
you orthem at risk.

1765
01:46:35,188 --> 01:46:36,712
And not because I..

1766
01:46:39,726 --> 01:46:40,920
Hey Binu..

1767
01:46:41,461 --> 01:46:43,952
Have you deposited Iakhs to my
account without my knowledge?

1768
01:46:44,131 --> 01:46:45,098
Get lost.

1769
01:46:45,165 --> 01:46:47,156
My ATM card has turned rotten.

1770
01:46:47,634 --> 01:46:48,896
Gone?
Hey! Wait!

1771
01:46:49,002 --> 01:46:49,969
See you.

1772
01:46:50,036 --> 01:46:51,469
No commission for me?

1773
01:46:52,038 --> 01:46:53,471
Can you hear me?

1774
01:46:53,940 --> 01:46:54,907
Good.

1775
01:46:55,142 --> 01:46:56,109
And now?

1776
01:46:57,644 --> 01:46:58,611
Come.

1777
01:47:04,584 --> 01:47:05,551
Can you hear now?

1778
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:07,644
Don't shout.
I can hear properly now.

1779
01:47:08,021 --> 01:47:09,113
Come.
Sit down.

1780
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:15,486
Let's do one more review
after a month, okay?

1781
01:47:23,036 --> 01:47:24,003
There he is.

1782
01:47:24,905 --> 01:47:26,873
Looks like your clients
have come home, lawyer sir.

1783
01:47:32,446 --> 01:47:34,915
Why does Lalu sir
have to do this?

1784
01:47:34,915 --> 01:47:36,883
It must be with the
Superintendent's consent.

1785
01:47:37,117 --> 01:47:40,018
Or else, will Lalu sir do this?
- That's also true.

1786
01:47:52,866 --> 01:47:54,026
Great food!

1787
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:57,234
It's been a long time since
I had home cooked food.

1788
01:48:08,548 --> 01:48:09,515
You came?

1789
01:48:09,716 --> 01:48:12,685
If you had told me earlier, I
would've cooked something special.

1790
01:48:12,752 --> 01:48:15,482
Mom!
- Dear, how did it go?

1791
01:48:15,555 --> 01:48:17,491
Everything is all right, mom.

1792
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:20,051
Be careful when you complain about me.
I can hear everything now.

1793
01:48:20,260 --> 01:48:21,227
Let me see.

1794
01:48:21,761 --> 01:48:23,194
Can't see anything there.

1795
01:48:23,263 --> 01:48:24,821
It's an implant, mom.

1796
01:48:25,799 --> 01:48:27,198
What?
- It's kept inside.

1797
01:48:29,769 --> 01:48:32,738
The policemen said that
they need only Iimejuice.

1798
01:48:32,806 --> 01:48:35,639
I'll slice these mangoes
to give them after lunch.

1799
01:48:35,876 --> 01:48:38,003
Go ask them if they
need anything else.

1800
01:48:38,078 --> 01:48:39,045
Go!

1801
01:48:39,880 --> 01:48:40,812
Come here.

1802
01:48:40,881 --> 01:48:42,473
Let me have a look again.

1803
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:47,084
Why have you come here, sir?

1804
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:49,678
When I felt like meeting
my lawyer urgently,

1805
01:48:50,624 --> 01:48:52,615
it's an idea that the
policemen gave me.

1806
01:48:53,026 --> 01:48:54,118
ljust fainted.

1807
01:48:54,794 --> 01:48:57,297
A blood test and check up
at Government hospital,

1808
01:48:57,297 --> 01:48:59,094
with tight police escort.

1809
01:49:07,541 --> 01:49:09,008
Got it?
- Got it, sir.

1810
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:11,971
You took it with a lot
of trouble, right?

1811
01:49:13,013 --> 01:49:14,674
Now let it be with me safely.

1812
01:49:15,982 --> 01:49:16,949
Keep it.

1813
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,527
Sir..

1814
01:49:28,161 --> 01:49:29,628
Come.
Let's talk..

1815
01:49:29,963 --> 01:49:31,157
New TV..

1816
01:49:32,065 --> 01:49:33,032
Washing machine,

1817
01:49:34,034 --> 01:49:36,628
you could have modified the
house on the whole, huh?

1818
01:49:36,903 --> 01:49:37,870
There's time, right?

1819
01:49:38,338 --> 01:49:39,305
Sir..

1820
01:49:39,739 --> 01:49:41,138
Mangoes.
- Good.

1821
01:49:42,108 --> 01:49:43,268
Thank you.

1822
01:49:44,878 --> 01:49:46,937
Mom, the food was superb.

1823
01:49:47,981 --> 01:49:50,347
And your son is really smart.

1824
01:49:50,650 --> 01:49:52,277
That means, a genius.

1825
01:49:52,385 --> 01:49:56,116
Ever since this case came only, we
could start standing up properly. - Nice.

1826
01:49:56,289 --> 01:49:57,256
But..

1827
01:49:57,857 --> 01:50:00,018
just that it was on my back!

1828
01:50:01,962 --> 01:50:03,293
Right, Advocate Binu?

1829
01:50:08,702 --> 01:50:11,136
Cochlear implant.
Got it done, right?

1830
01:50:12,072 --> 01:50:14,734
Must have cost 30,000 Rupees, right?
- Roshi sir..

1831
01:50:15,375 --> 01:50:17,707
How is it afterfixing it?
Can you hear properly?

1832
01:50:18,178 --> 01:50:19,770
And now..
- Dear..

1833
01:50:19,879 --> 01:50:20,937
Chechi!

1834
01:50:22,916 --> 01:50:24,178
What did you think about me?

1835
01:50:24,651 --> 01:50:26,744
Were you playing a
game with me, you dog?

1836
01:50:26,920 --> 01:50:30,617
Roshi never came to enquire
where you piss or shit.

1837
01:50:30,757 --> 01:50:33,123
But my money..
My money that I'm paying you..

1838
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:36,352
Did you think I won't know what
you're doing with it, you rascal?

1839
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:39,855
Sir, don't hit him.

1840
01:50:39,933 --> 01:50:41,366
Don't hit him, sir.

1841
01:50:43,770 --> 01:50:46,671
Sirs, please save my son.

1842
01:50:46,806 --> 01:50:48,208
Leave me, sir.
- Leave him.

1843
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:49,175
Leave him.

1844
01:50:50,276 --> 01:50:51,243
Mom!

1845
01:50:52,145 --> 01:50:54,247
You made me do this.

1846
01:50:54,247 --> 01:50:56,950
Didn't I tell you about my frustration?
- Roshi sir.

1847
01:50:56,950 --> 01:50:58,247
Enough, sir.
Leave him.

1848
01:50:59,753 --> 01:51:00,720
Hey! Look here.

1849
01:51:01,154 --> 01:51:03,918
I'm telling you.
I need bail.

1850
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:08,025
You play a game, or put my money in that
Sukumaran's grave or do whatever you want!

1851
01:51:08,094 --> 01:51:09,356
Idon'tgive a damn!

1852
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:12,625
But you should get me out.
You will.

1853
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:15,163
Or else, I will come
once again like this.

1854
01:51:15,301 --> 01:51:18,634
On that day, it won't be just her
eardrum that I'm going to destroy.

1855
01:51:18,705 --> 01:51:19,672
Understood?

1856
01:51:20,473 --> 01:51:21,440
Mom!

1857
01:51:22,409 --> 01:51:24,377
Mom, thanks for lunch.

1858
01:52:44,758 --> 01:52:47,784
We were able to know that Roshi
Balachandran won't get bail today.

1859
01:52:47,861 --> 01:52:51,319
There's information that Roshi's
hand in both cases have been proved.

1860
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:53,888
The controversial case of
Home guard Sukumaran..

1861
01:52:53,967 --> 01:52:55,969
We were able to know from
the court premises that,

1862
01:52:55,969 --> 01:52:59,029
the verdict will be passed in home
Guard Sukumaran's murder case.

1863
01:52:59,105 --> 01:53:01,508
The actress Aishwarya's family
& friends believe that,

1864
01:53:01,508 --> 01:53:05,877
they would also be served
justice related to this, in one way.

1865
01:53:10,250 --> 01:53:12,878
(indistinct questions)
- Move.

1866
01:53:13,353 --> 01:53:15,321
Rowdy Sir, will Roshi
get bail today or not?

1867
01:53:15,388 --> 01:53:16,355
It's sure.

1868
01:53:16,422 --> 01:53:18,788
I've given such
brilliant evidences.

1869
01:53:18,925 --> 01:53:21,758
Magistrate will copy my plea
as it is & pass the verdict.

1870
01:53:21,828 --> 01:53:24,888
And notjust the Supreme Court, even
the district court can't correct it.

1871
01:53:24,964 --> 01:53:26,488
That's it.
Move.

1872
01:53:26,566 --> 01:53:29,194
And ya, you've been behind
this for so many days, right?

1873
01:53:29,335 --> 01:53:31,938
After the verdict is passed,
we'll distribute sweets.

1874
01:53:31,938 --> 01:53:33,530
Go only after having them.
I'm telling you.

1875
01:53:36,042 --> 01:53:37,009
Roshi sir..

1876
01:53:46,085 --> 01:53:48,383
Anyway, today you'll get bail, sir.

1877
01:53:49,122 --> 01:53:51,215
If I get, good for you.
- Yes.

1878
01:53:51,524 --> 01:53:53,321
You getting the bail
is my necessity now.

1879
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:56,888
There will be a final decision
made about you today.

1880
01:53:57,197 --> 01:53:58,459
This case itself will be rejected.

1881
01:53:58,865 --> 01:54:01,060
I didn't get you.
- I've found a solution forthat.

1882
01:54:01,968 --> 01:54:03,993
Just say whatever I
tell you, in the court.

1883
01:54:04,938 --> 01:54:07,065
CC 132I18

1884
01:54:09,008 --> 01:54:10,032
Sir!

1885
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:12,278
Order! Order!

1886
01:54:14,013 --> 01:54:15,605
This Roshi Balachandran,

1887
01:54:15,849 --> 01:54:20,343
went for the Badminton league at
Meghamala resort on September 24th,

1888
01:54:20,420 --> 01:54:22,285
and he had consumed
alcohol there

1889
01:54:22,355 --> 01:54:24,380
I've submitted evidences
for that including photos.

1890
01:54:24,457 --> 01:54:28,985
His driver Dennis has given a statement
that Roshi himself drove the car that day.

1891
01:54:29,128 --> 01:54:31,596
Roshi cannot go to
his house in Kochi,

1892
01:54:31,664 --> 01:54:34,189
without passing through
Mamalayurfrom Meghamala.

1893
01:54:34,868 --> 01:54:37,503
That road goes via the back gate
of MountZion hospital,

1894
01:54:37,503 --> 01:54:39,528
where Sukumaran was killed.

1895
01:54:39,973 --> 01:54:42,305
The street food vendor Anthony
has given his statement that,

1896
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:44,376
he saw a big car
hitting Sukumaran.

1897
01:54:44,677 --> 01:54:47,237
Sukumaran's daughter
gave a statement that,

1898
01:54:47,347 --> 01:54:52,410
Roshi's manager offered them financial
help iftheir family didn't file a case.

1899
01:54:53,553 --> 01:54:54,520
My God!

1900
01:54:56,322 --> 01:54:57,983
First time I'm saying so much together.
That's why.

1901
01:54:58,091 --> 01:55:00,218
Should I get up &
clap, Sundareshan?

1902
01:55:00,293 --> 01:55:01,294
No sir.

1903
01:55:01,294 --> 01:55:02,886
I would like to have some water.

1904
01:55:03,263 --> 01:55:04,958
Go ahead.
- Chechi..

1905
01:55:15,141 --> 01:55:16,665
Can't you hang him at least now?

1906
01:55:18,945 --> 01:55:22,608
Crime CRPC 132/18

1907
01:55:23,182 --> 01:55:26,583
In the case in which home guard
Sukumaran Pillai was killed,

1908
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:30,387
since there are no more pleas to be heard.
- No more pleas, sir. You pass the verdict!

1909
01:55:30,523 --> 01:55:31,490
Right?

1910
01:55:34,227 --> 01:55:35,194
What say, Advocate Bin u?

1911
01:55:35,361 --> 01:55:38,262
Sir, he got up to ask if he
could go home. Sit down!

1912
01:55:38,364 --> 01:55:39,626
Your client will be hanged.

1913
01:55:39,699 --> 01:55:42,190
Go only after hearing that verdict. Okay?
- Sundareshan!

1914
01:55:42,268 --> 01:55:46,204
Sir, the statement that the deceased
Sukumaran's daughter recorded,

1915
01:55:46,372 --> 01:55:49,933
that my client offered financial
aid to them, is true.

1916
01:55:50,209 --> 01:55:51,506
But..
- There he goes again.

1917
01:55:51,678 --> 01:55:54,579
But the honourable court shouldn't
see it as a confession,

1918
01:55:54,681 --> 01:55:56,410
or an attempt to
com promise the case.

1919
01:56:03,056 --> 01:56:05,524
Kochi Action & Rehabilitation Force.

1920
01:56:05,692 --> 01:56:07,956
It's a registered
trust in Kochi, sir.

1921
01:56:08,294 --> 01:56:11,593
My client is also a member
among 30 of their trustees.

1922
01:56:11,731 --> 01:56:14,666
For the treatment of those
who're injured in accidents,

1923
01:56:14,734 --> 01:56:18,192
and to provide financial aid
to the family ofthe deceased;

1924
01:56:18,271 --> 01:56:20,000
It's a trust formed for all that.

1925
01:56:20,773 --> 01:56:25,506
As a trustee, Mr. Roshi extended a
helping hand to Sukumaran's family.

1926
01:56:25,712 --> 01:56:27,009
That's what happened, sir.

1927
01:56:27,113 --> 01:56:28,080
Binu sir,

1928
01:56:28,281 --> 01:56:30,943
consider that I accepted
these evidences;

1929
01:56:31,451 --> 01:56:35,251
Even then, it's not proved that it wasn't
your client who committed the crime.

1930
01:56:35,989 --> 01:56:37,752
Give me ten minutes
time to prove that.

1931
01:56:38,458 --> 01:56:40,259
As if you're going to topple
the case in 10 minutes.

1932
01:56:40,259 --> 01:56:41,658
Write it, Sir.
- Sundareshan.

1933
01:56:42,428 --> 01:56:44,055
Advocate Binu, continue.

1934
01:56:51,304 --> 01:56:53,204
On September 24th,

1935
01:56:53,272 --> 01:56:56,207
after the badminton match
at a resort in Meghamala,

1936
01:56:56,275 --> 01:56:58,209
before leaving after the
celebrating the victory,

1937
01:56:58,311 --> 01:57:00,108
my client got really drunk.

1938
01:57:00,346 --> 01:57:01,313
It's true.

1939
01:57:01,447 --> 01:57:05,975
He drove his KL 47 G 6008 Com pass Car,

1940
01:57:06,052 --> 01:57:08,111
by himselfwhile
going down the hill.

1941
01:57:08,254 --> 01:57:09,221
That's also true.

1942
01:57:09,555 --> 01:57:13,992
If you say 2 more truths, the 10
minutes you asked for will be over.

1943
01:57:14,127 --> 01:57:15,461
Please sit down, Sundareshan.

1944
01:57:15,461 --> 01:57:20,023
Sir, it's true that he crashed his car,
losing control because he was drunk.

1945
01:57:20,266 --> 01:57:23,258
But that crash didn't happen
near MountZion hospital here.

1946
01:57:23,469 --> 01:57:26,199
Then did he crash into your aunt's house?
- Sundareshan!

1947
01:57:26,472 --> 01:57:27,439
Sorry sir.

1948
01:57:28,141 --> 01:57:29,369
Then where was it, Binu sir?

1949
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:33,171
Sir, after the game that day, my
client didn't go back to Kochi.

1950
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:36,748
Instead, he took the Konnikkara turning,
without touching Mamalayur,

1951
01:57:36,816 --> 01:57:39,452
and went to Maruthupandipuram
in Theni district,

1952
01:57:39,452 --> 01:57:41,387
where he has an estate
& cardamom plantations.

1953
01:57:41,387 --> 01:57:43,412
I'm submitting the
details of the estate.

1954
01:57:46,592 --> 01:57:49,652
On the way there, near
Kerala-Tamil Nadu border,

1955
01:57:49,729 --> 01:57:54,132
it was a tea shop in a village called
Puliyakkurisshi in Theni district,

1956
01:57:54,267 --> 01:57:58,033
that my client crashed into, under the
influence of alcohol, with his Compass car.

1957
01:57:58,471 --> 01:57:59,802
And I should believe this?

1958
01:58:05,144 --> 01:58:07,635
This is a copy ofthe Mahassar from
Puliyakkurrisshi station, sir.

1959
01:58:13,186 --> 01:58:16,178
On the same day that home guard
Sukumaran was killed in an accident,

1960
01:58:16,355 --> 01:58:17,515
around the sametime,

1961
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:22,659
my client was around 60 km away from
the crime scene, at Puliyakkurisshi;

1962
01:58:22,728 --> 01:58:25,128
and those documents prove that, sir.

1963
01:58:26,332 --> 01:58:28,630
Indian Evidence Act
Section 11,

1964
01:58:29,235 --> 01:58:30,202
Alibi.

1965
01:58:31,170 --> 01:58:32,228
New section?

1966
01:58:32,405 --> 01:58:33,838
It wasn't there when I studied.

1967
01:58:37,710 --> 01:58:41,441
Theni DSP Mr. Ravi Paulraj, who's
investigating the tea shop crash,

1968
01:58:41,547 --> 01:58:43,412
is present here.

1969
01:58:43,716 --> 01:58:45,775
Shall I call him, sir?
- Objection, Your Honour.

1970
01:58:46,886 --> 01:58:47,853
How can he be presented?

1971
01:58:48,121 --> 01:58:49,088
What is it, Swamy?

1972
01:58:49,155 --> 01:58:52,852
Without a prior notice, to bring anyone
from Andhra or Tamil Nadu, is this a lodge?

1973
01:58:53,126 --> 01:58:57,256
Whoever comes, it's me who decided whether
I should accept the statement or not.

1974
01:58:57,330 --> 01:58:58,558
But Your Honour..
- Sir,

1975
01:58:58,798 --> 01:59:00,823
such a witness was allowed
forthe prosecution.

1976
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:02,265
No! That is different.

1977
01:59:02,335 --> 01:59:04,570
A witness from the list of witnesses came,

1978
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:06,401
rectified her statement
and went back.

1979
01:59:06,506 --> 01:59:07,666
That is within the law.

1980
01:59:07,740 --> 01:59:09,575
That too, the own
daughter of the deceased.

1981
01:59:09,575 --> 01:59:12,445
And it wasn't a watchman of some
shady place who gave the statement.

1982
01:59:12,445 --> 01:59:14,413
This won't happen here.
This cannot be allowed.

1983
01:59:17,450 --> 01:59:19,418
How can you say that, Swamy?

1984
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:21,754
What should be done in my
court, leave it to me.

1985
01:59:21,754 --> 01:59:23,779
How can I leave that?
This is illegal.

1986
01:59:23,856 --> 01:59:26,759
Someone who's not related to this case
at all should not be allowed in court.

1987
01:59:26,759 --> 01:59:29,729
If you, who's not related to this
case at all, can talk so much;

1988
01:59:29,729 --> 01:59:31,287
I can record a witness statement.

1989
01:59:31,397 --> 01:59:33,262
And I will put it on record as well.
- No! No!

1990
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:34,366
It's not possible.

1991
01:59:34,433 --> 01:59:35,501
This is bloody law.

1992
01:59:35,501 --> 01:59:36,900
You can'tjust do
whatever you want.

1993
01:59:36,969 --> 01:59:38,437
No! Iwon't allow it.

1994
01:59:38,437 --> 01:59:39,404
Yes.

1995
01:59:39,805 --> 01:59:41,363
I can do whatever I want.

1996
01:59:43,576 --> 01:59:45,441
This is my bloody court.

1997
01:59:47,580 --> 01:59:49,172
If you can't shut your mouth,

1998
01:59:49,448 --> 01:59:51,245
please get out of my court.

1999
01:59:51,317 --> 01:59:53,717
Sir... that..
- If you uttera word more,

2000
01:59:53,953 --> 01:59:56,217
for interrupting the
court's procedures,

2001
01:59:56,322 --> 01:59:57,516
I'll send you to jail.

2002
01:59:57,657 --> 01:59:58,624
Sit down!

2003
02:00:00,793 --> 02:00:01,760
Sit, Swamy!

2004
02:00:04,997 --> 02:00:05,964
Bloody...

2005
02:00:06,632 --> 02:00:08,293
Him & his English.

2006
02:00:13,739 --> 02:00:16,435
Advocate Binu, call the witness.

2007
02:00:34,627 --> 02:00:36,891
Say whatever you want to say, sir.
- Okay.

2008
02:00:50,476 --> 02:00:53,707
September 24, at around
9 PM in the night;

2009
02:00:53,813 --> 02:00:57,476
someone completely destroyed a tea shop
called 'Murugan's Grace',

2010
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:01,509
on the National Highway at Puliyakkurisshi
village in Theni district, with a car.

2011
02:01:01,887 --> 02:01:04,447
We could confirm the car's
number only a few days back.

2012
02:01:04,523 --> 02:01:06,025
Since then, we were
searching forthe owner.

2013
02:01:06,025 --> 02:01:08,493
By chance, I met Advocate Binu.

2014
02:01:08,561 --> 02:01:11,428
That's how I came to know about the
details of the case happening here.

2015
02:01:36,389 --> 02:01:41,691
According to the statement ofthe priest of
the temple nearthat shop, Senthooravelan;

2016
02:01:41,761 --> 02:01:46,323
and it's confirmed that the shop was
destroyed by a red colour Jeep Com pass car;

2017
02:01:46,399 --> 02:01:50,699
and that its number
was KL 47 G 6008.

2018
02:01:55,408 --> 02:01:58,344
When he came to know that my client
is on the verge of being punished,

2019
02:01:58,344 --> 02:01:59,745
fora crime he didn't commit;

2020
02:01:59,745 --> 02:02:01,940
Ravi sir came all the way
hereto help me out.

2021
02:02:02,014 --> 02:02:02,981
Not just that,

2022
02:02:03,115 --> 02:02:05,777
the people running that hotel
were really poor people.

2023
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:07,946
That was their only
source of income.

2024
02:02:08,054 --> 02:02:11,023
Through this court, if they could
be given some com pensation..

2025
02:02:11,891 --> 02:02:14,553
Sir, I'm submitting my
client's consent letter that,

2026
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:17,661
it was him indeed who crashed into
that hotel while he was drunk,

2027
02:02:17,730 --> 02:02:20,494
and that he will pay the com pensation
directed by this court.

2028
02:02:20,733 --> 02:02:24,897
Along with that, I'm also submitting the
English & Tamil newspapers ofthe next day.

2029
02:02:25,604 --> 02:02:28,732
And sir, this is exclusively
for your special attention.

2030
02:02:53,799 --> 02:02:56,700
The facts mentioned in the confession
that you have submitted here,

2031
02:02:57,603 --> 02:03:01,941
did you write it yourself, or did you
write under some kind of pressure?

2032
02:03:01,941 --> 02:03:05,968
Nothing. It was me who got drunk,
drove and destroyed that shop.

2033
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:10,375
And I'm ready to face any
consequences of the law,

2034
02:03:10,483 --> 02:03:12,974
and provide any compensation
as directed by this court.

2035
02:03:14,720 --> 02:03:18,713
Sajla, the trial of home guard
Sukumaran's accident case is over now.

2036
02:03:18,958 --> 02:03:21,153
In a case in which the culprit
was almost confirmed,

2037
02:03:21,427 --> 02:03:24,658
we have to wait & watch whetherthe
evidences provided by the defence counsel;

2038
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:26,721
can topple the whole verdict itself.

2039
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:37,671
CC 132I18

2040
02:03:38,177 --> 02:03:41,476
Home Guard Sukumaran
Pillai's accident case.

2041
02:03:42,515 --> 02:03:46,474
The prosecution wasn't able to
present adequate evidences to prove,

2042
02:03:46,585 --> 02:03:50,112
that it was Roshi Balachandran
who committed the crime.

2043
02:03:50,923 --> 02:03:54,120
Instead, the defence counsel

2046
02:04:01,467 --> 02:04:04,903
As per Indian Evidence Act,

2047
02:04:06,071 --> 02:04:07,038
Thus,

2048
02:04:07,673 --> 02:04:14,875

2049

Yes.

2050
02:04:19,218 --> 02:04:22,054
In the case charged for destroying

Palayankottai First Class

2055
02:04:37,736 --> 02:04:41,729
Thanks to all those who co-operated

2056
02:04:49,281 --> 02:04:50,509
Is that so?

2057
02:04:51,484 --> 02:04:53,679
Did you get the message from the bank?
- Yes. Thank you.

2058
02:04:54,086 --> 02:04:55,754
So how about Tamil Nadu?

2059
02:04:55,754 --> 02:04:56,982
Who will get me out from there?

2060
02:04:57,056 --> 02:04:59,456
Oh no! I'm not that fluent in Tamil..
- No need.

2061
02:04:59,558 --> 02:05:01,025
I'll arrange someone else there.

2062
02:05:01,093 --> 02:05:03,118
For a tea shop destruction case,

2063
02:05:03,195 --> 02:05:05,686
SeniorAdvocate Binu
Choorezhan is not needed.

2064
02:05:05,931 --> 02:05:07,057
Okay.
- Okay.

2065
02:05:07,299 --> 02:05:08,891
Thank you.

2066
02:05:09,168 --> 02:05:10,135
Shall we go?

2067
02:05:10,236 --> 02:05:11,897
Sorry.
Shall we go (in Tamil)?

2068
02:05:11,971 --> 02:05:14,030
Let's go.
- Sir, he's our guy.

2069
02:05:14,573 --> 02:05:16,837
Take good care of him.
- Definitely.

2070
02:05:23,883 --> 02:05:24,850
Handcuff him.

2071
02:05:27,953 --> 02:05:28,920
Just a formality.

2072
02:05:29,622 --> 02:05:30,589
Give me your hand.

2073
02:05:30,956 --> 02:05:31,923
Give it, man!

2074
02:05:40,733 --> 02:05:42,496
Go!
- What the bloody hell?

2075
02:06:01,053 --> 02:06:04,318
He's being taken for the
crime of stealing a rope;

2076
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:07,882
but does he know that there's a cow
atthe end of the rope, Binu sir?

2077
02:06:11,897 --> 02:06:15,526
2 similar accidents.
One in front of Mount Zion hospital here;

2078
02:06:15,734 --> 02:06:18,202
and the other one in Tamil Nadu.
In Theni.

2079
02:08:02,241 --> 02:08:04,076
Whoever did that hit & run,

2080
02:08:04,076 --> 02:08:07,876
it was like God himself
came and did it.

2081
02:08:09,748 --> 02:08:12,740
Because, those 3 guys
deserved to die.

2082
02:08:16,355 --> 02:08:18,789
Shall I give you a culprit, sir?

2083
02:08:37,910 --> 02:08:41,368
But who would have killed them by
crashing the car into the tea shop?

2084
02:08:41,480 --> 02:08:43,448
Who does all these things?

2085
02:08:43,916 --> 02:08:45,440
Like it is said in the Bhagavat Gita,

2086
02:08:45,984 --> 02:08:48,987
Even when man climbs the
peaks of ultimate knowledge,

2087
02:08:48,987 --> 02:08:50,989
the question that he can
never find an answer to.

2088
02:08:50,989 --> 02:08:54,720
Buddha and Sankaracharya, also searched
forthe answer ofthis question.

2089
02:08:55,194 --> 02:08:56,161
Who?

2090
02:08:56,328 --> 02:08:57,295
Who?

2091
02:08:57,362 --> 02:08:59,098
Ya right! Bhagavat Gita!

2092
02:08:59,098 --> 02:09:02,499
This is a dialogue that Mohanlal says to
Kolappulli Appan in Aaram Thampuran movie.

2093
02:09:02,835 --> 02:09:04,837
This is Gita.
-Aaram Thampuran!

2094
02:09:04,837 --> 02:09:05,804
Mani!

2095
02:09:06,004 --> 02:09:07,339
A Magistrate is saying this.

2096
02:09:07,339 --> 02:09:10,274
Just because you're a Magistrate, you
can't cheat us with movie dialogues.

2097
02:09:10,342 --> 02:09:11,707
Stop there.
- I don't want to hear.

2098
02:09:11,810 --> 02:09:14,108
Dude, it's from the Gita.
- It's from Aaram Thampuran.

2099
02:09:14,179 --> 02:09:16,147
Trust me.
- I'll buytea for you. - No need.

2100
02:09:16,381 --> 02:09:18,872
Binu, the ones who were killed
are not ordinary people.

2101
02:09:19,017 --> 02:09:20,814
Will Roshi's case reach the court?

2102
02:09:28,393 --> 02:09:29,758
Hey! Come out, man!

2103
02:09:31,063 --> 02:09:32,325
Send him out!

2104
02:09:33,432 --> 02:09:35,332
Kill him!

2105
02:09:35,434 --> 02:09:36,833
We won't leave you alive.

2106
02:09:37,369 --> 02:09:38,336
You dog!

2107
02:09:45,344 --> 02:09:47,209
Stop the vehicle.

2108
02:09:53,051 --> 02:09:54,211
Stop the car.

2109
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:00,950
Come out, man!
