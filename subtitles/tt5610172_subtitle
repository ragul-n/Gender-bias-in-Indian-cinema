(Phone Ringing)

6
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:42,875
Hello?

7
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:43,750
Hello?

8
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,458
Yes.

9
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,000
I have reached.

10
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:47,208
Okay.

11
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,167
Fine.

12
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:05,167
You were gathering
evidences against us?

13
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:05,917
Hit him.

14
00:05:06,167 --> 00:05:07,875
(Panting)

(Door Closes)

18
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,375
Sir!
- Sir!

19
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,375
Suchiya, his identity?

20
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:09,333
Impossible, sir.

21
00:06:09,417 --> 00:06:11,750
He's toast.

22
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,583
He doesn't even look human anymore.

23
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:27,792
Give.

24
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,583
Sent it to forensic.

25
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:51,750
Okay, sir.

26
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,292
Sir, this incident took
place close to his shop.

27
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,792
I didn't see anything, sir.

28
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,000
I had locked up and
gone home long back.

29
00:07:18,042 --> 00:07:19,792
I swear.

30
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:21,583
(Sobbing)

31
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,000
Let him go.

32
00:07:23,917 --> 00:07:24,583
Go.

33
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:25,667
Get lost.

34
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,083
Bless me, father.

35
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,542
Great. So you are finally awake.

36
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,083
I hope sleeping didn't tire you, son.

37
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:06,667
I would be tired only
if I had slept properly.

38
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,458
Power outrage takes place
whenever I plan to get some sleep.

39
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,667
Damn the electricity board employees!

40
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,708
Harvansh Kaur..

41
00:08:13,917 --> 00:08:16,125
Look, your son is cursing me.

42
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:18,167
I am not cursing you.

43
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,875
I am cursing the
electricity board employees.

44
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,292
And who am I?

45
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,000
You are my father.

46
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:23,750
(Chuckles)

47
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,917
Tony and uncle Bhola are
the electricity board employees.

48
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,958
They never face power outrage.

49
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,208
Even if there a power outrage,
they have a generator for it.

50
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,042
So they are the real electricity
board employees, right?

51
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,875
Okay.

52
00:08:35,042 --> 00:08:36,125
Today I learnt that.

53
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,542
I have been working there
for 18 years unnecessarily.

54
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,417
Hey, my son is awake.

55
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,208
Bless me, mother.

56
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:43,250
God bless you.

57
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:44,833
Go and get ready quickly.

58
00:08:44,917 --> 00:08:46,125
Oh, I forgot.

59
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,500
The car is already here
and you guys are still not ready.

60
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:49,750
I will be ready in five minutes.

61
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,958
Give tea to the driver, in the
meanwhile I will get ready. - Okay.

62
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:53,458
Wear a turban.

63
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,167
In the meanwhile,
I will make tea for the driver.

64
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,083
Hurry up.

65
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,542
How much longer will it take?

66
00:09:07,917 --> 00:09:09,417
'Bansa, what have you done!'

67
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,333
'Look, this is wrong.'

68
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:14,708
(Gun Firing)

69
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:23,000
'Anyone who stands before me, dies.'

70
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,042
'Who are you?'

71
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,958
'Stay in your limits!'

72
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:28,000

74
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,792
'He is dead.'

75
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,125
'What have I done!'

76
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,458
'How could I do this?'

77
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:08,917
'What have you done, brother?'

78
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,833
'You have done nothing.'

79
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,708
'What are you saying?'

80
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:14,542
'Keep quiet.'

81
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,875
'You are under my oath.'

82
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,958
'You won't tell anyone about this.'

83
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,083
'Do you understand?'

84
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,167
'Jeeta?'

85
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,208
'That's it.'

86
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,833
(Sirens Wailing)

87
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:46,917
No, Jeeta.

88
00:10:47,833 --> 00:10:48,583
No.

89
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:53,208
You don't belong there.
You belong over here.

90
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:54,833
In my heart.

91
00:10:55,667 --> 00:11:01,625
You have done for me what
no one in this world does for anyone.

92
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:06,375
Your our brother a hug
and give him some peace.

93
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,208
(Crying)

94
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,083
No, brother.

95
00:11:13,917 --> 00:11:14,792
Don't cry.

96
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,333
No, brother.

97
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:18,083
Don't cry.

98
00:11:18,167 --> 00:11:21,417
Look sister-in-law, he is crying.
- Hello, uncle.

99
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:22,833
God bless you.

100
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:24,833
Ranjeet.

101
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:26,542
My son.

102
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:28,958
God bless you.

103
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,958
Hello, sister-in-law.
- God bless you.

104
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
(Bangles sound)

105
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:21,917
Till I don't hear your bangles,
I don't feel awake.

106
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
A penny for your thoughts, brother.

107
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:28,458
What are you looking at?

108
00:12:28,542 --> 00:12:29,167
Nothing.

109
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,208
I was just looking at the stars.

110
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,833
I can see them during the day today.

111
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,250
Okay, the stars.

112
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,292
I thought you are looking at the moon.

113
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:37,375
Stupid girl.

114
00:12:37,583 --> 00:12:38,833
Moon, during the day?

115
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,833
It shows up during the day sometimes.

116
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:42,917
You better mend your ways.

117
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,167
Okay.

118
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,125
Why should I bother?

119
00:12:45,292 --> 00:12:46,625
I had just come to give you milk.

120
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:50,375
You can look at the moon
or the stars all you want.

121
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:53,042
Deepi! Where are you?

122
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:55,375
Look, the loudspeaker has started.

123
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,083
Fine.

124
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:03,417
Where were you?

125
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,458
My throat has gone sore shouting.

126
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:06,583
I had gone to wake up brother.

127
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,750
Why wake him up?
It's not as if he has some job to do.

128
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,375
You should have first
finished doing your job.

129
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,042
All the household chores
are yet to be done.

130
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,083
Our courtyard is dirty.

131
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,333
Who will clean it?

132
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:16,833
Stop it, dear.

133
00:13:17,042 --> 00:13:19,125
Why do you always keep
shouting at the children?

134
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,125
You better keep quiet.

135
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,708
You shouldn't spoil your children.

136
00:13:23,792 --> 00:13:25,875
If she doesn't learn
household chores now..

137
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:27,292
..then what will she do after
she goes to her in-laws' house?

138
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:29,500
They will hold her by
her plait and throw her out.

139
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't say bad things.

140
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,750
You shouldn't stress
yourself like this.

141
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,417
And you should scold at young girls.

142
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Sure. I am the only one who is bad.

143
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:40,583
There is something wrong
with me that I look after them.

144
00:13:40,792 --> 00:13:44,333
No matter how much I do,
I will still be a stepmother.

145
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,750
It's okay, dear. Take this. Offerings.

146
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,250
Come with me.

147
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,833
Enough. We have had enough.

148
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,208
Today, he will not be spared.

149
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:22,208
What happened?

150
00:14:23,167 --> 00:14:23,917
Why are you upset?

151
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,375
What will I be if not upset?

152
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:27,667
The black bull caused a mess again.

153
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:29,458
You guys only keep talking.

154
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:30,792
You should drown yourself.

155
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,042
You didn't respect
the samosas I fed you.

156
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,125
Don't worry.

157
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,167
We will handle him. Let's go.

158
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,000
Where is he?

159
00:14:37,083 --> 00:14:39,750
He got scared of me and ran away.

160
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:43,750
If I had gotten hold of him
then I would have beaten him up.

161
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,792
Dollar?

162
00:14:45,667 --> 00:14:47,708
But he didn't come to college today.

163
00:14:47,875 --> 00:14:49,875
Why did you make me carry a
hockey if he didn't come to college?

164
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:50,583
It's okay.

165
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:51,583
We will take care of him.

166
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,083
Let's go.
- Let's go.

167
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:52,875
Let's go.

168
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,875
Look, that tiny fellow is coming.

169
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:56,792
Bye, brother.
- Bye.

170
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,792
Let me know.
- Yes, of course. - Hold this.

171
00:14:58,875 --> 00:14:59,625
Welcome.

172
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:00,875
We were just thinking about you guys.

173
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,000
I know you guys.
You must be gossiping.

174
00:15:04,167 --> 00:15:05,000
How do you know, brother?

175
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:07,167
Your roguish faces tell us everything.

176
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,625
Now that's a face to remember.

177
00:15:21,417 --> 00:15:27,333
(Music Playing)

178
00:15:30,542 --> 00:15:36,083
"Your bangles keep
troubling me at night."

179
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:41,792
"The imp keeps kissing you."

180
00:15:42,292 --> 00:15:47,792
"Your bangles keep
troubling me at night."

181
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:53,458
"The imp keeps kissing you."

182
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:59,375
"My heart wishes to break
all barriers hold back love."

183
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:05,250
"This boy from Amritsar,
is crazy about you."

184
00:16:05,708 --> 00:16:11,750
"This boy from Amritsar,
is crazy about you."

185
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:26,417
"I stay high without drinking."

186
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,208
"I swear on God."

187
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:32,333
"There is a lot of
beauty in this world."

188
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:35,000
"But there is no one like you."

189
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:40,000
"My heart fears of losing you."

190
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:46,583
"It loves you boundlessly."

191
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:52,542
"My eyes cannot survive
without your sight."

192
00:16:53,042 --> 00:16:58,542
"This boy from Amritsar,
is crazy about you."

193
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:04,708
"This boy from Amritsar,
is crazy about you."

194
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:16,375
"Your killer eyes have
made many lovers go crazy."

195
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:22,042
"People fight the world for love,
they fought with God."

196
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:27,333
"I want you to wear
my wedding bangles."

197
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:33,625
"Please don't betray me, my love."

198
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:39,833
"My heart is eager to make you mine."

199
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,750
"This boy from Amritsar,
is crazy about you."

200
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,292
"This boy from Amritsar,
is crazy about you."

201
00:17:51,750 --> 00:18:00,125
"This boy from Amritsar,
is crazy about you."

202
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,125
It's so late.

203
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,833
He still hasn't come home.

204
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:21,500
Go to sleep, Harvansh Kaur.

205
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:23,708
For how long will you stay awake?

206
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,542
He will come back when
he is done loitering around.

207
00:18:27,792 --> 00:18:29,667
But he has never been so late before.

208
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,167
Call up him once.

209
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,375
Once? I have already
called him up 10 times.

210
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:36,000
But his phone is switched off.

211
00:18:36,042 --> 00:18:37,875
I wonder where my son is.

212
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,792
I am worried for him.

213
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,708
(Footsteps Receding)

214
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,042
Father, what are you doing over here?

215
00:18:51,167 --> 00:18:52,542
You didn't go to sleep?

216
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,000
What is it, Deepi?

217
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:56,542
What happened?

218
00:18:57,292 --> 00:18:57,917
(Sighs)

219
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,250
Nothing, brother.

220
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,083
Bankers had come.
They took the tractor.

221
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,333
Father is upset because of that.

222
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:06,083
That's all.

223
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,250
No, father.

224
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:08,750
Don't worry.

225
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:10,375
They have just taken away the tractor.

226
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,458
They cannot take away our fate.

227
00:19:14,417 --> 00:19:15,458
We will get another one.

228
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,042
Don't feel sad.

229
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,083
Sad?

230
00:19:21,042 --> 00:19:22,583
Can I say something?

231
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:26,125
Nothing can make a jat sad.

232
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,333
A loan?

233
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:32,875
A Jat burdened with a
loan from the time he is born.

234
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:40,333
I don't know why,
from the time they took the tractor..

235
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:47,667
I am getting a feeling that
someone has taken away my son from me.

236
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,000
One keeps seeing
good days and bad days.

237
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,875
Bad days have gone away,
now soon good days will come.

238
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:54,833
I just have this one
year of studies left.

239
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,750
Then everything will get settled.

240
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:02,208
Now wipe your tears and go to bed.

241
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,500
Go ahead and feed him dinner.

242
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,750
After all, he has won a medal.

243
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,875
He has made my life miserable.

244
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,583
He keeps loitering
around till late night.

245
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,208
If he continues behaving
like this then..

246
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:20,750
..he will surely get
us into trouble one day.

247
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,208
I don't want to eat.

248
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:25,375
I am not hungry.

249
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,458
No, son. Don't say that.

250
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:33,417
Look, you shouldn't
mind your parents' scolding.

251
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:34,792
Come on, eat.

252
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,500
I am unfortunate, mother.

253
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:40,042
Whenever I try to do something good,
something bad happens with me.

254
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:42,125
What bad happened with you?

255
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:43,542
Tell me.

256
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,583
What bad happened today?

257
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,250
It was my friend's birthday.

258
00:20:46,417 --> 00:20:49,208
While returning from there, I found
someone who had met with an accident.

259
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:50,875
I took him to the hospital.

260
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,167
What wrong did I do in that?

261
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,333
I don't know why God
is being so cruel to me.

262
00:20:54,417 --> 00:20:56,333
No, don't say that.

263
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,500
You didn't do anything wrong.

264
00:20:58,667 --> 00:21:00,458
God will set everything right for you.

265
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:03,000
He won't go anything good for me.

266
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,000
And this is reason why
I shall fight with Him one day.

267
00:21:05,042 --> 00:21:07,333
No, don't say that.

268
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:12,292
You know we have got you
after praying a lot to God.

269
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:14,125
But I cannot tolerate
these taunts every day.

270
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:15,542
Fine. Enough now.
- No.

271
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:17,583
No one will taunt you henceforth.

272
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,875
Okay? No one will taunt.

273
00:21:20,792 --> 00:21:22,625
Eat, at least now.
- Okay.

274
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:23,875
I know..

275
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:28,500
I very well know that
my son is a very capable man.

276
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,708
He will win many medals for me.

277
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,167
You will, won't you?

278
00:21:34,375 --> 00:21:35,542
I will, mother.

279
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:39,708
But we won't give
a single medal to father.

280
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:40,542
(Chuckles)

281
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,708
We won't give a single medal.

282
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:44,208
We won't tell your father about it.
- Better.

283
00:21:44,292 --> 00:21:45,208
Okay?
- Yes.

284
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:46,833
Now eat. Okay?

285
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,167
Come on.

286
00:21:54,833 --> 00:21:55,833
The job wasn't done, brother.

287
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,167
I think it will take some time.

288
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,667
Jaswinder,
time is something that I don't have!

289
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,083
I think I only will have
to do something about it.

290
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,417
Okay, brother.

291
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:12,958
Here, son. Have freshly made bread.

292
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:15,417
Enough, mother. I am full.
- But..

293
00:22:20,542 --> 00:22:22,792
How are your studies going on?
- Good.

294
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:26,583
Don't feel shy to
ask if you need anything.

295
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,625
Take money from me when you need them.

296
00:22:30,208 --> 00:22:31,333
Okay, father.

297
00:22:36,333 --> 00:22:39,792
Harvansh Kaur, feed pure
clarified butter to him. - Yes.

298
00:22:40,583 --> 00:22:41,833
He has become weak.

299
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:46,417
What did you feed him last night?

300
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,833
I think father has finally grown up.

301
00:22:48,917 --> 00:22:49,542
(Chuckles)

302
00:22:49,625 --> 00:22:50,167
Right?

303
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,958
I told you, you shouldn't
feel bad about what he says.

304
00:22:53,042 --> 00:22:54,167
How did he change so suddenly?

305
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:57,042
I told you, my brother is very good.

306
00:22:57,083 --> 00:22:58,458
(Chuckles)

307
00:22:58,792 --> 00:22:59,958
Fine. Now eat.

308
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:01,792
Bye, mother.

309
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,292
I am going to college..

310
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:05,917
Hold on.

311
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:06,750
Now what?

312
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,250
Hold on a minute.

313
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:13,333
Mother..

314
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:17,792
You can forget anything
else but not this.

315
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,292
How can I forget?

316
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,333
After all I am a mother.

317
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:23,875
This keeps you away from all evil.

318
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:25,750
You are the best mother.

319
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:27,833
God bless you.

320
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,708
Go.

321
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:32,917
Stop.

322
00:23:33,042 --> 00:23:34,292
Stop over here.
- Okay.

323
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,125
(Bike Engine Sound)

324
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,333
Stop, brother. I am very late.

325
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:37,417
Listen..

326
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,167
Again singing chorus?

327
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,000
You know everything..

328
00:23:41,042 --> 00:23:42,292
You also know what
the situation is at home.

329
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,542
It's not as if I like to
sing chorus behind the lead singer.

330
00:23:44,792 --> 00:23:45,500
You are impossible.

331
00:23:45,583 --> 00:23:46,958
Here, take my book with you.

332
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,042
See you in the evening.

333
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:48,583
Okay.

334
00:23:48,667 --> 00:23:49,875
Come to pick me up.
- See you in the evening.

335
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:50,833
(Bike Engine Sound)

336
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,292
Debay?
- Yes, brother?

337
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:59,208
Get flour from Manjeet's
flourmill. - Fine.

338
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:00,875
Don't forget.
- I won't.

339
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,750
Please wait.
- Oh no.

340
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:04,833
Wait.
- Now what?

341
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:06,458
"Now what?"
- Yes.

342
00:24:06,542 --> 00:24:08,375
You always forget
to take your medicine.

343
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,375
You forgot today as well.

344
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,292
Come on, open your mouth.

345
00:24:11,458 --> 00:24:12,083
Here you go.

346
00:24:12,708 --> 00:24:14,208
Drink some water.

347
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,917
Don't take such good care of me.

348
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,292
I will get spoilt.

349
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:29,958
Sister-in-law,
I wanted to ask you something.

350
00:24:30,042 --> 00:24:30,958
Go ahead.

351
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:37,125
Do all wives take such good
care of their husbands like you do?

352
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:45,292
Debay, it is every wife's
duty to look after her husband.

353
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:48,333
To serve him.
- Okay.

354
00:24:49,167 --> 00:24:50,833
Why did you ask that?

355
00:24:52,875 --> 00:24:56,042
I was thinking that..

356
00:24:56,625 --> 00:24:59,625
If I..

357
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,792
(Chuckling)

358
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,042
Let it be.

359
00:25:03,833 --> 00:25:05,000
(Chuckling)

360
00:25:05,042 --> 00:25:08,417
So you were enjoying Bhanghu's songs.

361
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,667
There are many requests
but we don't have much time.

362
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,667
We have to go to
Barnala to perform next.

363
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:16,708
So, coming before
you with the last song..

364
00:25:16,792 --> 00:25:19,417
The pride and honor of Punjab..

365
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,042
The strong voice of Punjab..

366
00:25:22,083 --> 00:25:24,000
Dharamveer Bhanghu.

367
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,333
(Crowd Applauding)

368
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,250
Here you go, sir.

369
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,750
Okay, so on my brothers' request..

370
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,708
I am going to sing a few
lines from my upcoming album.

371
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:40,708
Please pay attention.

372
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,875
Mona, pick it up from the second.

373
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:44,708
Yes, okay.

374
00:25:45,292 --> 00:25:47,917
"Look, this boy has become crazy."

375
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:51,458
"He has started following me."

376
00:25:51,542 --> 00:25:52,833
"He has let go of all shame."

377
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:57,375
"He says,
I shall never get a like you."

378
00:25:57,458 --> 00:25:59,958
"He comes close to me and says..
- I love you!"

379
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,792
"He says I love you!"

380
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:04,208
"He comes close to me and says..
- I love you!"

381
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:05,958
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

382
00:26:06,042 --> 00:26:08,625
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

383
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:11,292
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

384
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,958
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

385
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:16,458
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

386
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:19,042
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

387
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,750
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

388
00:26:21,833 --> 00:26:24,417
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

389
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,083
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

390
00:26:27,167 --> 00:26:30,250
"He says I love you!"
- "I love you!"

391
00:26:31,417 --> 00:26:33,667
Sa-re-ga-ma-pa-dha-ni-sa..
- Look, sir is here.

392
00:26:34,792 --> 00:26:35,375
Bless me.

393
00:26:35,542 --> 00:26:37,625
Hello, sir.
- Hello.

394
00:26:39,208 --> 00:26:40,208
You didn't practice well.

395
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,458
You should practice.
- Okay, sure.

396
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:46,458
That's all, sir?

397
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,292
What else do you want? A buffalo?

398
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:51,583
Go away.
- He always pays stingily.

399
00:26:54,292 --> 00:26:56,333
The arrangements are great, uncle.

400
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:58,083
There are so many elephants here.

401
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:03,000
Ranjeet,
what's the rent of this palace?

402
00:27:03,208 --> 00:27:04,250
It is very expensive.

403
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,083
Not for people like you and me.

404
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,708
Why not?

405
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,958
We will get you married
in a grand style in this palace.

406
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:11,833
Really?

407
00:27:12,458 --> 00:27:14,542
It was a good program.
- Yes, it was good.

408
00:27:14,792 --> 00:27:16,542
Bye. - Okay. Bye.
- Bye, Gurtej.

409
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:17,875
Bye.
- Bye.

410
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:19,250
How are you?

411
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:23,292
Hello, uncle.
- Hello.

412
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,750
You know many girls.

413
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,625
You are famous.

414
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,042
You must be having a lot of fun.

415
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,667
No fun, uncle.

416
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,542
They are artists.
We do cultural programs together.

417
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:36,583
Really?

418
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:38,417
Listen..
- Yes.

419
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,250
Come closer.

420
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:43,417
Do you have their phone numbers?

421
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:44,375
Phone number?

422
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:47,000
Uncle, why do you
need their phone number?

423
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:50,500
I am not asking it for myself.

424
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:52,667
Won't we need them for your wedding?

425
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,458
We don't have any entertainment
during your wedding?

426
00:27:54,542 --> 00:27:55,958
Forget about my wedding.

427
00:27:56,042 --> 00:27:57,583
You leave for the village.
I will drop him and come.

428
00:27:57,792 --> 00:28:00,250
Then why did you ask me to come here?

429
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,000
To show you the glamour.

430
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:04,167
Bye, uncle.

431
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,583
Bye.
- Bye.

432
00:28:06,458 --> 00:28:07,292
Bye.

433
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:13,750
There is someone
is my distant relation.

434
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:16,292
I had met her during a wedding.

435
00:28:17,042 --> 00:28:20,833
She was wearing jeans and goggles.

436
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,958
She was beautiful.

437
00:28:23,167 --> 00:28:25,208
Just like Madhuri Dixit.

438
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:30,958
She has done the JBT course.

439
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,625
She is a teacher.

440
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:39,708
If she agrees then things
might work out for you, Debay.

441
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:44,167
Sister-in-law, how old is she?

442
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,542
What do you have to do with her age?

443
00:28:45,625 --> 00:28:46,375
Tell me if you wish to go ahead.

444
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,375
I will send your proposal.

445
00:28:48,042 --> 00:28:51,708
No. I mean what if
her knees don't work?

446
00:28:51,917 --> 00:28:54,875
What if she comes
and makes you serve her?

447
00:28:54,958 --> 00:28:56,042
No, no, no.

448
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,750
It is not so.

449
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,167
She goes to school to
teach every day, on foot.

450
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:01,208
Really?

451
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,125
In which city does she teach?

452
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,375
She is from Chandigarh.

453
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:09,667
She is teaching in
a government school.

454
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,042
Okay.

455
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,292
"Get me married!"

456
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:15,500
Okay, okay.

457
00:29:15,583 --> 00:29:17,917
"Get me on the horse!"

458
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:21,917
Sister-in-law,
then you shouldn't bother.

459
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,958
Why?

460
00:29:25,042 --> 00:29:29,417
Boys say that girls from
Chandigarh are impossible.

461
00:29:29,708 --> 00:29:30,917
Really.

462
00:29:32,042 --> 00:29:34,708
They don't buy cell
phones less than Rs. 50,000.

463
00:29:34,792 --> 00:29:38,917
They go to the beauty palor
twice in a month for a haircut.

464
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,958
How will I be able
to take her to salons?

465
00:29:45,375 --> 00:29:47,167
Let it be.

466
00:29:47,458 --> 00:29:49,708
You don't like any girl.

467
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:51,292
Sister-in-law!
- What is it?

468
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,417
Find someone from here, close by.

469
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,042
Fine, I will.
- Yes, she agreed.

470
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:00,542
"Get me married!"

471
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,042
She agreed.

472
00:30:02,125 --> 00:30:05,208
Debay! Listen..
- Coming!

473
00:30:05,292 --> 00:30:06,458
Coming right away!

474
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,250
I will do all the work.

475
00:30:08,583 --> 00:30:09,625
I will do it right away.

476
00:30:12,167 --> 00:30:13,833
Lord Almighty.

477
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,125
I seek your blessings, father.

478
00:30:15,208 --> 00:30:15,833
God bless you.

479
00:30:15,917 --> 00:30:17,333
You are back, son.
- How are you feeling now?

480
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,125
Better.

481
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:20,042
Then, you should pat your son's back.

482
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,000
Why, have you won a medal?

483
00:30:22,042 --> 00:30:24,250
Uncle, your nephew cleared the exams.

484
00:30:24,333 --> 00:30:24,792
Congratulations.

485
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,208
Really?
- Yes.

486
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:27,833
God bless you, my son.

487
00:30:27,917 --> 00:30:28,375
(Chuckling)

488
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,083
You have made me happy.

489
00:30:30,167 --> 00:30:33,042
Come here, give me a hug.

490
00:30:33,125 --> 00:30:34,042
(Chuckling)

491
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,125
Now give me some sweets.

492
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:35,917
Here you go, father.

493
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,667
Brother, have you really
cleared your exams?

494
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:38,375
Then what!

495
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:41,125
What about sweets for me?

496
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,042
This one is for you
and this one is for you.

497
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:46,667
(Chuckling)

498
00:30:56,292 --> 00:30:58,708
Here, have some sweets.

499
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:00,667
I have cleared the exams.

500
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:05,333
Now I will soon get a job.

501
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:07,375
I suggest you start
making preparations.

502
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:12,667
To apply henna on your hands.

503
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:15,417
To wear wedding bangles.

504
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,000
And to marry me.

505
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:21,208
(Music Playing)

506
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:47,833
"My eyes never get tired
of admiring your beauty."

507
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:55,083
"My eyes never get tired
of admiring your beauty."

508
00:31:56,625 --> 00:32:00,750
"My heart desires you.."

509
00:32:00,833 --> 00:32:05,625
"My heart desires you.."

510
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:09,708
"What else do I tell you?"

511
00:32:11,542 --> 00:32:16,958
"My eyes never get tired
of admiring your beauty."

512
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,250
"My eyes never get tired."

513
00:32:19,333 --> 00:32:26,333
"My eyes never get tired
of admiring your beauty."

514
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:37,792
"Without a word from you,
I know how you feel."

515
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:41,417
"Such is our situation."

516
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,625
"If you get angry.."

517
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:49,250
"I feel as if the
world is angry with me."

518
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,292
"As if the world is angry with me."

519
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:56,208
"Never be angry with me."

520
00:32:56,542 --> 00:33:00,583
"Just be faithful with me."

521
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:05,625
"No matter how many
sorrows we have to face."

522
00:33:07,375 --> 00:33:14,042
"My eyes never get tired
of admiring your beauty."

523
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:17,750
"I am crazy about you."

524
00:33:17,958 --> 00:33:19,708
"Crazy about you."

525
00:33:19,792 --> 00:33:21,583
"I am crazy about you."

526
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,667
"My heart is crazy about you."

527
00:33:27,792 --> 00:33:35,042
"When the moon rises,
it takes the darkness away."

528
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:43,000
"My love, your presence
brings dawn to my life."

529
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:46,292
"Your presence brings
dawn to my life."

530
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:49,708
"You being away from me.."

531
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:54,458
"Is something that I cannot tolerate."

532
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:59,250
"I will be left with nothing."

533
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:15,708
"My eyes never get tired
of admiring your beauty."

(Engine Sound)

536
00:34:56,083 --> 00:34:57,750
Stop! Stop! Stop!

537
00:34:58,333 --> 00:34:59,375
Where to?

538
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:00,375
We have come here for an interview.

539
00:35:00,458 --> 00:35:01,375
Interview for what?

540
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:03,208
The position has already been filled.

541
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:04,917
How can the position
be filled just like that?

542
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,208
Do you have money?

543
00:35:06,417 --> 00:35:07,292
Do you have any recommendations?

544
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:08,667
If you don't, then get out of here.

545
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:10,167
There is something
called as talent as well.

546
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:10,917
I will talk to them.

547
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,417
I told you! Get out of here.

548
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,208
Pick up your talent
and get lost from here.

549
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:17,875
People like you show up every day.

550
00:35:33,542 --> 00:35:34,167
Son..

551
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:00,833
So what have you thought?

552
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:03,208
What's left to think?

553
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,417
I thought I would get a job.

554
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,542
I would repay father's loan.

555
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:07,792
I would get my sister married.

556
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,333
Everything is over now.

557
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,250
We will have to do something, brother.

558
00:36:14,708 --> 00:36:16,042
Otherwise, nothing will work out.

559
00:36:18,583 --> 00:36:19,333
(Crying)

560
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,250
Brother!

561
00:36:21,042 --> 00:36:21,708
What happened?

562
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,375
Why are you crying?

563
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,083
What happened? Why are you crying?

564
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,042
Brother..

565
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:29,125
Father..

566
00:37:02,917 --> 00:37:03,958
Father..!

567
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,792
(Crying)

568
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:07,417
Father..!

569
00:37:09,625 --> 00:37:10,750
Father..!

570
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:27,042
Ranjeet?

571
00:37:29,167 --> 00:37:30,000
Yes, mother?

572
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:32,167
Where are you going
so early in the morning?

573
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,292
I am going to end this
for once and for all, mother.

574
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:36,750
But where are you going?

575
00:37:36,875 --> 00:37:38,375
I am going Harmandir Sahib.

576
00:37:38,875 --> 00:37:41,375
Today I will return only
after settling the score with Him.

577
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:49,750
Go, my son.

578
00:37:50,792 --> 00:37:51,750
Come back on time.

579
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:52,833
Okay, mother.

580
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:53,958
Go.

581
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,208
'Oh Lord Almighty!'

582
00:38:08,417 --> 00:38:10,000
'The owner of this world..'

583
00:38:10,292 --> 00:38:12,583
'We have come to pray before You.'

584
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,458
'We cannot tolerate the
taunts of this world anymore.'

585
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:18,125
'There is no aim in our life.'

586
00:38:18,375 --> 00:38:20,042
'Please show us the
right direction today.'

587
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:25,083
'Either give us the aim
of our life or end our life.'

588
00:38:41,583 --> 00:38:42,167
Watch out!

589
00:38:42,625 --> 00:38:43,542
Be careful, sir.

590
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,083
God bless you, son.

591
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:56,625
What happened? Let's go.

592
00:38:56,875 --> 00:38:58,458
That elderly man..

593
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,875
The elderly man? What about him?

594
00:39:00,958 --> 00:39:01,792
He was..

595
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,250
Tell me, what happened?

596
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:07,667
When I supported him,
I felt a talisman around his arm.

597
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:10,292
A talisman? So what's the big deal?

598
00:39:10,375 --> 00:39:11,500
Have you gone crazy?

599
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:13,792
How can a baptized
Sikh wear a talisman?

600
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:15,375
It's nothing. Let's go.

601
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,625
Come with me..
- But..

602
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,833
(Engine Starting)

603
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:35,000
Why are you running?

604
00:39:35,042 --> 00:39:36,917
He's the same guy,
the one wearing a talisman.

605
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,333
What do you have to do with him?

606
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,667
Man.. You come with me.

607
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,042
Just come with me.
- What do we have do with this?

608
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:43,000
(Bike Engine Sound)

609
00:39:45,208 --> 00:39:47,208
Sir, I want to discuss something
very important with you.

610
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:48,000
Okay.

611
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:50,375
I had gone to Harmandir
Sahib to pay homage.

612
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,208
I came across a senior citizen there.

613
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,958
He slipped on the stairs
and I supported him.

614
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:56,333
When I supported him, I noticed that..

615
00:39:56,417 --> 00:39:58,500
He had a talisman tied around his arm.

616
00:39:58,750 --> 00:39:59,833
He was wearing a talisman, so?

617
00:39:59,917 --> 00:40:01,417
He was a baptized Sikh.

618
00:40:01,583 --> 00:40:04,000
How can a baptized
Sikh wear a talisman?

619
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:09,208
Son, a lot of Sikhs have digressed.

620
00:40:10,417 --> 00:40:13,458
They wear talismans.
They worship idols.

621
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:15,000
They visit Pundits.

622
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,292
They have all digressed.

623
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:20,083
He too must have digressed.

624
00:40:21,542 --> 00:40:23,417
Sir, you don't understand.

625
00:40:23,583 --> 00:40:25,250
You listen to me.

626
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:27,375
Now what do you want me to do?

627
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,500
Should I ask him
to remove the talisman?

628
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,542
Sir, this isn't about the talisman.

629
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,500
I think he is not a good man.

630
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:35,667
Son, the way you two are
behaving is not good either.

631
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,042
Please hear us out, sir.

632
00:40:37,292 --> 00:40:39,000
No, you listen to me.

633
00:40:39,958 --> 00:40:44,833
There is no law or section under which I
can ask a person to remove his talisman.

634
00:40:44,917 --> 00:40:45,583
Do you understand?

635
00:40:45,667 --> 00:40:46,875
Sir, please.
- Please leave.

636
00:40:46,958 --> 00:40:48,500
Just a minute.
- Please leave.

637
00:40:48,583 --> 00:40:49,583
Go away!

638
00:40:49,667 --> 00:40:50,167
Leave.

639
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,500
Suchiya, make them leave. Go away!

640
00:40:54,208 --> 00:40:55,833
Happy now? You got us insulted.

641
00:40:55,917 --> 00:40:57,042
Do you want us to get
a little more insulted?

642
00:40:57,292 --> 00:40:59,042
He is very arrogant.

643
00:40:59,125 --> 00:41:00,708
And why should you bother
if someone is wearing a talisman?

644
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,167
At least you try to understand me.

645
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,958
I spoke about it because
I thought it was fishy.

646
00:41:04,042 --> 00:41:05,208
Fine, you are right.

647
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:06,042
Let's go now.

648
00:41:06,542 --> 00:41:07,375
Unnecessarily..

649
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:09,833
Sister-in-law!

650
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:12,042
Where are you?

651
00:41:12,167 --> 00:41:13,375
Upstairs.

652
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:15,792
What happened? Why are you shouting?

653
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,833
What are you making?

654
00:41:20,917 --> 00:41:24,250
I am making sun-dried
green gram dumplings for you.

655
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:28,000
You can only make dumplings for me.

656
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,208
You cannot find a match for me.

657
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,292
Your match will be made.

658
00:41:32,542 --> 00:41:34,542
But we need to find someone
who matches perfectly for you.

659
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:36,250
What can we say about matches?

660
00:41:36,417 --> 00:41:39,208
Something can happen only if you want.

661
00:41:39,792 --> 00:41:42,500
Find me a bombshell, please.

662
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,958
Who hides her face under a veil..

663
00:41:46,333 --> 00:41:49,708
..and fills the courtyard
with the sound of her anklets.

664
00:41:50,167 --> 00:41:53,167
Oh yes, anklets remind me.

665
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:57,292
Lambar's Bishan had
sent a proposal, but..

666
00:41:58,292 --> 00:41:59,042
Let it be.

667
00:41:59,125 --> 00:42:00,042
Why should I let it be?

668
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,167
Please tell me.

669
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:02,833
She still studies.

670
00:42:02,917 --> 00:42:05,750
Am I a monkey that
I will tear her books?

671
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:07,417
She can continue studying
after marriage too.

672
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,792
Yes, you are right.

673
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:12,583
But there is a problem.

674
00:42:13,542 --> 00:42:16,042
She starts talking about something
and she says there's a problem.

675
00:42:16,125 --> 00:42:17,917
Hey, you tell me.

676
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:20,208
What is wrong with you?

677
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:24,958
You are smart,
tall and a handsome young man.

678
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,208
(Chuckling)

679
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,458
Tell me?

680
00:42:28,042 --> 00:42:29,333
Then what is the problem?

681
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,833
What do I tell you?

682
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:32,833
The girl..
- Yes?

683
00:42:33,083 --> 00:42:34,375
She doesn't have a mother?

684
00:42:34,583 --> 00:42:37,708
No. Both her parents are alive.

685
00:42:37,792 --> 00:42:39,917
Then is she shortsighted?

686
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,750
No. She sees just fine.

687
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:45,333
But..
- But what?

688
00:42:46,708 --> 00:42:49,125
She wears an artificial leg..

689
00:42:49,958 --> 00:42:51,625
"Someone beautiful.."

690
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:53,708
"Someone charming.."
- Okay.

691
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:55,667
"Someone beautiful.."

692
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:57,667
"Someone charming.."

693
00:42:57,750 --> 00:42:59,625
"Get me a wife."

694
00:42:59,792 --> 00:43:01,125
So tell me.

695
00:43:01,792 --> 00:43:04,083
"Get me married."

696
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:05,333
Then let it be.

697
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:07,208
"Get me on a horse."

698
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:09,250
You just want to
keep making dumplings.

699
00:43:09,417 --> 00:43:10,875
You don't want to get me married.

700
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,500
(Laughing)

701
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,125
Give me another.
- Here you go.

702
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:19,125
Hello.
- Hello.

703
00:43:25,208 --> 00:43:26,167
Bye.

704
00:43:31,458 --> 00:43:32,375
Here's your money.

705
00:43:39,667 --> 00:43:40,750
Sorry, brother.

706
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,292
Hello! Brother!

707
00:43:52,583 --> 00:43:54,042
You dropped something.

708
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:55,583
Hello! Brother!

709
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:58,250
Brother, you left something behind.

710
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,458
Listen to me, brother!

711
00:44:18,167 --> 00:44:19,250
Strange.

712
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,708
(Bike Engine Sound)

713
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:50,500
Wait! Where are you going!

714
00:44:57,625 --> 00:44:58,583
(Door Opens)

715
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:00,917
What happened? Who was it?

716
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,208
Uncle, they were thieves.
- What happened, son?

717
00:45:02,292 --> 00:45:03,125
They ran away.

718
00:45:03,208 --> 00:45:05,375
Don't worry.
Nothing happened. I am here for you.

719
00:45:05,583 --> 00:45:07,250
But why did thieves come to our house?

720
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,667
Sister-in-law,
thieves must have come to steal.

721
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,250
Do you think they came
with a marriage proposal for me?

722
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:12,250
Is everything in place?

723
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:13,125
Everything is in place.

724
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,125
They wanted my pant.

725
00:45:14,208 --> 00:45:15,250
What?
- Oh no.

726
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:16,333
Okay, okay, okay.

727
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:17,583
I understood.

728
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:19,500
They must be druggies of our village.

729
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:20,708
They must be looking for money.

730
00:45:20,792 --> 00:45:21,500
What else can it be?

731
00:45:21,792 --> 00:45:24,167
Son, you should sleep
with us downstairs, tonight.

732
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,125
Come with me.
- Let's go.

733
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,083
Are you alright?
- I am fine.

734
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,208
How did they climb upstairs?
- Let's go inside.

735
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:31,292
You don't need to worry
as I am here, brother.

736
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:33,375
I can die for you.

737
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:34,875
Who is there?

738
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:41,083
(Phone Ringing)

739
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:47,458
Hello?

740
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:50,667
Ranjeet?
- Yes. Who are you?

741
00:45:51,042 --> 00:45:52,792
You don't need to know that.

742
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:54,750
Listen to what I have to say.

743
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:56,833
You have a piece of paper with you.

744
00:45:58,083 --> 00:46:00,333
I want it to be with
me by tomorrow evening.

745
00:46:01,208 --> 00:46:01,875
Really?

746
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:03,583
What if I don't give it to you?

747
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:05,750
Your father works for
the electricity board, right?

748
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:07,500
He checks electricity meters.

749
00:46:08,292 --> 00:46:09,625
He stays out during the day.

750
00:46:10,083 --> 00:46:12,042
He might get crushed under a truck.

751
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:13,083
Listen to me!

752
00:46:13,167 --> 00:46:14,583
You are threatening me?

753
00:46:14,917 --> 00:46:15,750
If you have the courage then
come before me and talk to me.

754
00:46:15,833 --> 00:46:16,958
Calm down.

755
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:21,417
I'll call you up and let you know where
and when you need to deliver that paper.

756
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:22,583
Hello?

757
00:46:23,625 --> 00:46:24,333
Hello?

758
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:51,875
Stop it. Don't try to get inside it.

759
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:53,167
This is a blank paper.

760
00:46:53,292 --> 00:46:54,292
It does not contain anything.

761
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:56,583
Even I know that.

762
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:58,958
But last night people
came home to steal it.

763
00:46:59,458 --> 00:47:01,667
And I got a threatening
call in the morning.

764
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,167
There is something fishy, brother.

765
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:07,458
Was this paper treated
using a scientific method?

766
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:10,500
It is possible that
it shows under a light.

767
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:12,125
What do you say?

768
00:47:32,042 --> 00:47:35,083
I told you, there is nothing in it.

769
00:47:35,625 --> 00:47:37,292
I am sure you are mistaken.

770
00:47:39,875 --> 00:47:41,667
(Phone Ringing)

771
00:47:47,792 --> 00:47:48,417
Hello?

772
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,208
At 5:00pm.

773
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:52,333
Hall Gate's backside market.

774
00:47:52,708 --> 00:47:54,625
Hang up and be there.

775
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,000
(Bike Engine Sound)

776
00:48:05,792 --> 00:48:07,875
(Car Horn Honking)

777
00:48:09,375 --> 00:48:10,542
The paper?

778
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:17,333
Give it to her.

779
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,792
Wait for me. I will be right back.

780
00:48:25,875 --> 00:48:27,000
Wait for my signal.

781
00:48:27,042 --> 00:48:28,000
Be careful.

782
00:48:46,292 --> 00:48:47,042
You?

783
00:48:47,417 --> 00:48:48,542
Why are you following me?

784
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:49,750
Don't misunderstand me.

785
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:52,000
I just want to know
what's in this paper.

786
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:54,417
Look, I don't know who you are.

787
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:58,542
But I would advice you
to go back where you came from.

788
00:48:58,792 --> 00:49:00,500
I will leave,
just tell me what's in that paper.

789
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:01,750
Get this straight.

790
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:05,375
If I shout,
everyone in this area will come here.

791
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:07,625
You don't know what
will happen to you.

792
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:08,417
Really?

793
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:09,917
Then why don't you shout?

794
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,667
Heed my advice. Save yourself.

795
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:13,958
Go away from here.

796
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:16,375
Tell me what's in that
paper and I will leave.

797
00:49:16,542 --> 00:49:17,875
Please heed my advice, brother.

798
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,000
Go away. Save yourself.

799
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,333
Go away.

800
00:49:36,125 --> 00:49:37,792
(Bike Engine Sound)

801
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,083
Gurtej!

802
00:50:24,083 --> 00:50:26,042
(Gun Firing)

803
00:50:33,167 --> 00:50:34,833
(Gun Firing)

804
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,583
Take the paper from him.

805
00:51:29,417 --> 00:51:30,458
Remove his helmet.

806
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,417
Are you alright?
- Yes.

807
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:45,792
We lost him.

808
00:51:46,083 --> 00:51:48,458
It's okay. We still have the letter.

809
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:51,583
Today, because of us someone is dead.

810
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,625
Someone is died,
but we didn't kill her.

811
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:58,125
It is our fault somehow or the other.

812
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,917
Now I am sure about one thing.

813
00:52:00,292 --> 00:52:03,000
Whatever it is, it is very big.

814
00:52:03,042 --> 00:52:03,708
Do you agree with me now?

815
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,917
I told you, there is something fishy.

816
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,375
Ranjeet, but there is
something to think about.

817
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,417
If they can die for
this piece of paper..

818
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:15,167
Then they can do
anything to get it back.

819
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,458
(Phone Ringing)

820
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:19,875
Hello?

821
00:52:20,125 --> 00:52:21,167
A mistake.

822
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:22,542
A very big mistake.

823
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:24,375
You will be punished.

824
00:52:24,667 --> 00:52:26,417
Start gathering wood.

825
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,167
You are about to lose
a member of your family.

826
00:52:28,458 --> 00:52:29,333
Hello?

827
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:31,250
Hello?

828
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:33,375
Hello?

829
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:35,542
Whose call was it?

830
00:52:36,667 --> 00:52:37,833
Them.

831
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:40,667
Sister-in-law..

832
00:52:41,542 --> 00:52:42,625
Sister-in-law!

833
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,125
Sister-in-law..

834
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:55,667
Sister-in-law..

835
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,250
What is it?

836
00:52:59,792 --> 00:53:01,042
Did you talk to them?

837
00:53:01,333 --> 00:53:01,917
What about?

838
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,167
"Get me married."

839
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,958
The same we were talking
about the other day.

840
00:53:06,042 --> 00:53:07,125
"Get me on a horse."

841
00:53:07,292 --> 00:53:08,250
What did I say?

842
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:10,417
No..

843
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:13,958
Weren't you talking
about the one who..

844
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:16,583
"Get me married."

845
00:53:16,667 --> 00:53:18,208
What are you doing?

846
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:22,875
"Get me on a horse."
- The one who is..

847
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:25,042
Okay!

848
00:53:25,083 --> 00:53:26,833
The one from Kapurthala?

849
00:53:27,417 --> 00:53:30,042
That day you said she was Kotkapura.

850
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:32,083
Yes, so?

851
00:53:34,583 --> 00:53:37,167
Talk to them, if it works out.

852
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:40,708
But that you said that you
have nothing to do with a divorce.

853
00:53:40,792 --> 00:53:41,625
No.

854
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:44,958
But sister-in-law,
now my brain tell me..

855
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:48,833
..that if that poor girl
was left by her husband..

856
00:53:48,917 --> 00:53:50,875
..then what is her fault in that?

857
00:53:51,542 --> 00:53:56,250
And then, you will help
her bring up that child.

858
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:57,417
(Laughing)

859
00:53:57,833 --> 00:53:59,042
Fine, I will to them.

860
00:53:59,292 --> 00:54:01,708
Please get me married.

861
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:03,250
But you shouldn't back out later.

862
00:54:03,333 --> 00:54:05,083
No, I won't, I swear.

863
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:06,458
I swear on you..

864
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,375
Look Satveer..

865
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,333
Yes sir.

866
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:13,458
The transformer should be
placed at Fatehwal by tomorrow.

867
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:14,708
It is being loaded sir.

868
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,375
It will be placed soon enough.
- Very good.

869
00:54:16,625 --> 00:54:18,917
Watch out, I don't want any excuses.

870
00:54:19,083 --> 00:54:19,583
Okay, sir.

871
00:54:19,667 --> 00:54:21,625
The transformer should
be in place by tomorrow.

872
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:22,375
Okay, sir.
- Okay?

873
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:23,750
I am leaving now.
- Okay.

874
00:54:33,167 --> 00:54:34,417
No!

875
00:54:35,417 --> 00:54:36,458
What happened?

876
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:37,750
What happened, son?

877
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:38,583
Mother?

878
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:40,333
What are you doing here at this hour?

879
00:54:42,708 --> 00:54:44,792
I was watching you sleep.

880
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,125
I think you had a bad dream.

881
00:54:49,375 --> 00:54:50,333
I don't know, mother.

882
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:52,875
I have not been getting proper
sleep since the past few days.

883
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:00,042
Mother..

884
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:03,458
Please sing the lullaby you
used to sing to me when I was a baby.

885
00:55:05,625 --> 00:55:06,875
Fine, okay.

886
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:08,625
I will sing it for you.

887
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:15,542
(Singing) "May you always dwell
under cool shade."

888
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:21,750
"May you always dwell
under cool shade."

889
00:55:22,208 --> 00:55:26,875
"This is what I always
pray to God for."

890
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:37,333
Brother?

891
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,542
Drink some milk.

892
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:42,208
Why do you hide and bring milk for me?

893
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,833
And then, you get scolded.

894
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:47,292
I am not worried about the scolding.

895
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,042
I am worried about my brother.

896
00:55:52,375 --> 00:55:53,292
What's wrong, brother?

897
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:54,542
You look very sad.

898
00:55:55,333 --> 00:55:56,542
It's nothing, sister.

899
00:55:57,792 --> 00:55:59,417
I am just missing father.

900
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,917
I have to fulfill his dreams.

901
00:56:03,083 --> 00:56:04,458
I have to get you married.

902
00:56:05,250 --> 00:56:06,792
I won't leave my brother.

903
00:56:07,042 --> 00:56:07,750
Do you understand?

904
00:56:08,042 --> 00:56:09,042
Stupid girl.

905
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:10,042
Why won't you?

906
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:11,500
Deepi!

907
00:56:12,583 --> 00:56:13,792
Coming!

908
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:17,083
(Phone Ringing)

909
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:20,458
Yes, Ranjeet?

910
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,875
They had called.

911
00:56:22,208 --> 00:56:23,000
Come over quickly.

912
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:24,167
Okay, I am coming.

913
00:56:24,708 --> 00:56:25,667
(Door Opens)

914
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:27,875
(Bangles sound)

915
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,583
Are you sure this is the place?

916
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:38,583
Yes, this is the place.

917
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:39,875
Do you know what you have to do?

918
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:40,958
Yes, I will handle it. You go.

919
00:56:41,042 --> 00:56:42,083
Okay.
- Bye.

920
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:44,750
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

921
00:56:46,792 --> 00:56:48,083
(Door Opens)

922
00:56:54,875 --> 00:56:55,583
Give it to me.

923
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:06,000
(Door Closes)

924
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:39,042
Brother..

925
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,583
(Door Opens)

926
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,875
Langar Hall.

927
00:58:10,833 --> 00:58:12,542
Dukh Bhanjani Beri.

928
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,667
Darshani Deori (main entrance).

929
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:17,792
And..

930
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,208
Akal Takht.

931
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,250
I have seen one of them before.

932
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:36,500
Where?

933
00:58:40,042 --> 00:58:42,083
Oh, yes. The guy with the letter.

934
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:44,292
The one who banged
into me at the market.

935
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,542
His letter fell.
I went behind him to give the letter.

936
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,917
When he saw me,
he got scared and started running.

937
00:58:49,458 --> 00:58:52,750
This means this person
has seen you somewhere before.

938
00:58:54,542 --> 00:58:55,208
Where?

939
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,708
Come with me.

940
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:16,667
(Sirens Wailing)

941
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:30,917
Come with me, sir.

942
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:35,833
This is the place.

943
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,083
Suchiya.
- Yes, sir.

944
00:59:38,458 --> 00:59:40,208
Check.
- Follow me. Come on.

945
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:42,833
Okay.
- Two of you go there and check.

946
00:59:42,917 --> 00:59:43,500
You come with me.

947
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:44,750
Randeep, go and check.
- Okay, sir.

948
00:59:44,833 --> 00:59:45,292
Let's go.

949
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:46,375
Boys!
- Yes?

950
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,875
Check the place thoroughly.
- Yes.

951
00:59:49,458 --> 00:59:51,125
Check every nook and corner.
- Okay, sir.

952
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:52,708
Check carefully.
- Sir..

953
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,083
Move things around and check.
- This is the room, sir.

954
00:59:57,375 --> 00:59:58,333
Here..

955
00:59:59,125 --> 00:59:59,792
Here..

956
01:00:00,583 --> 01:00:02,000
Here, there was a map.

957
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:05,375
Sir, that man..
he was standing over here.

958
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:07,625
We saw them from this window.

959
01:00:07,875 --> 01:00:09,167
There were a lot of things over here.

960
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:11,625
Sir, everything has
changed over here. - Yes.

961
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:15,250
Sir.
- Suchiya, did you find anyone?

962
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:17,583
No, sir.
How can we find anyone here?

963
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:20,000
This place stinks so badly
that it's enough to kill anyone.

964
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:22,542
Sir, this is nothing serious.

965
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:24,375
They are idlers.
They don't have any jobs.

966
01:00:24,583 --> 01:00:26,500
They are seeking entertainment.

967
01:00:26,875 --> 01:00:29,000
So, there is no one over here.

968
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:30,542
Believe us, sir.

969
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:32,667
We stood there and saw them.

970
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:33,792
They were over here.

971
01:00:33,875 --> 01:00:35,708
If you saw them then
where are they now?

972
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:37,000
We are telling the truth.

973
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:37,833
There were six of them.

974
01:00:37,917 --> 01:00:38,500
Six men.

975
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,583
They looked like Sikhs.

976
01:00:40,667 --> 01:00:42,083
But they weren't Sikhs.
- Yes, sir.

977
01:00:42,208 --> 01:00:43,292
They weren't Sikhs,
they were dressed up as Sikhs.

978
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:45,167
You scoundrels!

979
01:00:46,083 --> 01:00:47,542
You have made me go crazy!

980
01:00:48,917 --> 01:00:49,792
You sometimes say
that they were Muslims.

981
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:51,042
And you sometimes
say that they were Sikhs.

982
01:00:51,667 --> 01:00:55,000
You rascals,
your statements don't match.

983
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,375
You come to the police
station every second day.

984
01:00:58,458 --> 01:00:59,542
Is the police sitting idle?

985
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:00,708
We aren't lying.
- Shut up.

986
01:01:01,292 --> 01:01:04,417
You rascals, get this straight.

987
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:08,375
If I see you anywhere
close to the police station..

988
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:12,667
..I will beat you both black and blue.

989
01:01:12,750 --> 01:01:13,792
Sir..
- Shut up.

990
01:01:17,792 --> 01:01:18,875
Shut up.

991
01:01:22,583 --> 01:01:23,458
Let's go, Suchiya.

992
01:01:25,208 --> 01:01:26,000
Let's go.

993
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:27,875
Behave yourself.

994
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,875
Sangrand (new month) is approaching.

995
01:01:33,042 --> 01:01:35,667
I don't understand where they went!

996
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,208
The mark is here.

997
01:01:39,583 --> 01:01:40,583
They are very clever.

998
01:01:41,333 --> 01:01:43,875
This is not as small
as we think it is, brother.

999
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:44,833
Right.

1000
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:46,708
But who will trust us?

1001
01:01:46,917 --> 01:01:48,167
How will we prove this?

1002
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:49,625
I don't know.

1003
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,750
But now it concerns a Gurudwara.

1004
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,917
We needed a job, right?

1005
01:01:55,958 --> 01:01:57,250
He has given us a job now.

1006
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,083
Let's go.

1007
01:02:02,292 --> 01:02:05,875
Khalsa belongs to Lord.
- Victory belongs to Lord.

1008
01:02:05,958 --> 01:02:06,875
Please have a seat.

1009
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:09,792
Tell me, how are you doing?

1010
01:02:09,875 --> 01:02:10,833
I am doing great.

1011
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:13,958
Manager, is the agreement ready?

1012
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:15,917
I prepared it long back.

1013
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,208
I just need your signatures on it.

1014
01:02:17,292 --> 01:02:18,125
Give it here.

1015
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:20,500
I'll sign them right away.

1016
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:22,708
Please read them, sir.

1017
01:02:22,875 --> 01:02:24,208
What are you saying?

1018
01:02:24,292 --> 01:02:25,292
I don't need to read them.

1019
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,458
This is a service to a Gurudwara.

1020
01:02:27,917 --> 01:02:29,208
Only fortunate ones
get a chance to do it.

1021
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:31,167
Okay then take Lord's
name and sign them.

1022
01:02:34,833 --> 01:02:36,250
Here you go.
- Give it to me.

1023
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:39,625
Felicitate him with a Siropa (turban).

1024
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:41,000
This is not required.

1025
01:02:41,042 --> 01:02:42,750
This is Gurudwara's blessings.

1026
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Blessed are those..

1027
01:02:45,083 --> 01:02:47,583
Those who take the name of Lord.

1028
01:02:47,667 --> 01:02:50,708
Khalsa belongs to Lord.
- Victory belongs to Lord.

1029
01:02:50,792 --> 01:02:51,667
Bye.
- Bye.

1030
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:53,000
Bye.
- Bye.

1031
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:55,000
Oh, Lord Almighty!

1032
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:18,500
What do we do now?

1033
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:19,958
What can we do?

1034
01:03:20,708 --> 01:03:21,458
He is the one who showed us the way.

1035
01:03:21,542 --> 01:03:22,792
He is the one who will
guide us to our destiny.

1036
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,292
Now He holds our strings.
He will do everything right.

1037
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:30,500
Look over there, isn't he the one?

1038
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:34,333
Yes, I think he is one of them.

1039
01:03:35,083 --> 01:03:36,708
Wait, I will strangle him.

1040
01:03:36,792 --> 01:03:37,417
Not yet.

1041
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:40,417
It's daytime.
There are a lot of people here.

1042
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,208
Let's wait till the sun sets.
We will handle him.

1043
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,375
(Door Closes)

1044
01:03:58,542 --> 01:03:59,500
The shop closed.

1045
01:03:59,875 --> 01:04:01,917
Ranjeet, as soon as I signal you,
come there with the tempo.

1046
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
Come on.
- Let's go.

1047
01:04:16,417 --> 01:04:18,333
Let's go, hurry up.

1048
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:20,208
Who are you?
- Wait, wait.

1049
01:04:20,292 --> 01:04:23,417
Who are you?
- Be careful. Hurry up.

1050
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,375
Close the door. - Stop.

1051
01:04:26,125 --> 01:04:27,458
Where have you brought me?

1052
01:04:27,708 --> 01:04:29,000
And what do you want?

1053
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,292
Look, I don't have much time to talk.

1054
01:04:32,917 --> 01:04:35,167
Quickly tell me what your plan is.

1055
01:04:35,958 --> 01:04:37,917
Plan? What plan?

1056
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,083
I don't understand.

1057
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,000
Don't make me angry.

1058
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:45,083
You very well know
what I want to hear.

1059
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:48,000
I don't know what you want.

1060
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:49,250
Speak up!

1061
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:50,708
He won't speak up so easily.

1062
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:53,417
Speak up!
- I don't know anything.

1063
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,292
Tell us what your plan is!

1064
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:55,750
I said I don't know anything.

1065
01:04:55,917 --> 01:04:57,917
Speak up!
- No!

1066
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:01,292
Now ask him.

1067
01:05:01,792 --> 01:05:04,500
The way you have boxed him, I doubt he
will wake up before tomorrow morning.

1068
01:05:04,708 --> 01:05:06,375
I have told you so many
times not to hit anyone?

1069
01:05:06,583 --> 01:05:08,667
But at least tell us what has he done?

1070
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:09,750
Shut up.

1071
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:13,417
Shinde, you should leave.
Your father must be getting worried.

1072
01:05:13,625 --> 01:05:15,583
Yes, brother.
Listen my father.. - Let's go.

1073
01:05:15,667 --> 01:05:17,333
I am leaving, brother.
- Let's go.

1074
01:05:18,458 --> 01:05:20,125
(Phone Ringing)

1075
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:29,625
Hello?

1076
01:05:30,167 --> 01:05:30,708
Yes, mother?

1077
01:05:30,792 --> 01:05:32,292
Where are you?

1078
01:05:32,958 --> 01:05:35,083
You didn't call or inform us.

1079
01:05:35,167 --> 01:05:37,583
Gurtej and I had come
to the city to meet Shinde.

1080
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:38,917
His sister is getting married.

1081
01:05:39,292 --> 01:05:40,667
He forced us to stay here.

1082
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:42,083
We will be back in a few days.

1083
01:05:42,167 --> 01:05:43,667
But you should have
informed me about it.

1084
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:46,042
You don't have any
clothes or money with you.

1085
01:05:46,167 --> 01:05:47,667
I have some money.

1086
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
Don't worry.

1087
01:05:49,333 --> 01:05:50,917
I'll come back and
meet you in a day or two.

1088
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,167
Okay. Take care.

1089
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:55,167
And keep calling me.

1090
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:56,792
Okay, mother. Bye.

1091
01:05:56,875 --> 01:05:58,042
Okay, son.

1092
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,417
(Water Sloshing)

1093
01:06:05,917 --> 01:06:07,042
No..

1094
01:06:17,667 --> 01:06:19,708
Look, you still have time.

1095
01:06:20,125 --> 01:06:21,458
Tell us the truth.

1096
01:06:21,542 --> 01:06:22,750
Otherwise..

1097
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:25,125
Speak up!

1098
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,042
Speak up!

1099
01:06:29,083 --> 01:06:29,958
Speak up!

1100
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:33,875
Stop it or he will die.

1101
01:06:35,375 --> 01:06:36,667
He won't speak up so easily.

1102
01:06:36,833 --> 01:06:37,958
You..!

1103
01:06:41,333 --> 01:06:43,500
Speak up!
- Babble out!

1104
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,375
I wonder what he is made of.

1105
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,375
But it's important for us
to find out what their plan is.

1106
01:06:53,875 --> 01:06:54,167
Here.

1107
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,958
You are here.
- Yes.

1108
01:07:08,792 --> 01:07:09,542
Okay.

1109
01:07:15,333 --> 01:07:17,125
Any news on Harnek?
- No, brother.

1110
01:07:17,792 --> 01:07:19,083
He didn't go home at night.

1111
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:20,542
I went to his shop as well.

1112
01:07:20,625 --> 01:07:21,458
It is closed.

1113
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:24,042
Then where did he go?
Did he disappear into thin air?

1114
01:07:25,333 --> 01:07:27,208
Is his phone on?
- No, brother.

1115
01:07:27,708 --> 01:07:28,417
It is switched off.

1116
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:30,458
I think something is wrong.

1117
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,958
If we don't know where
he is by tomorrow..

1118
01:07:34,458 --> 01:07:35,875
..then you should
change the whole program.

1119
01:07:36,375 --> 01:07:37,083
Okay, brother.

1120
01:07:38,250 --> 01:07:39,583
Any other orders for us?

1121
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,750
Isn't he the one?

1122
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:57,833
Free service of
fireworks and decoration.

1123
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:59,000
He is the one.

1124
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:00,667
But why did he take the
service of lighting up the..

1125
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:02,583
..Darbar Sahib and
doing the fireworks?

1126
01:08:03,542 --> 01:08:05,750
I told you something is fishy.
- Right.

1127
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,208
(Car Horn Honking)

1128
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:12,250
(Bike Engine Sound)

1129
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:19,750
We still don't have
any news on Harnek, brother.

1130
01:08:20,292 --> 01:08:22,083
I think Intelligence is behind it.

1131
01:08:22,958 --> 01:08:24,833
I fear, our mission might..

1132
01:08:26,625 --> 01:08:28,042
10 years!

1133
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:32,208
It took me 10 years
to be where I am today.

1134
01:08:32,917 --> 01:08:34,458
To make a status for myself.

1135
01:08:34,917 --> 01:08:37,000
To make a position
for myself in this city.

1136
01:08:37,417 --> 01:08:42,417
It has been 10 years
since I met my family.

1137
01:08:43,750 --> 01:08:46,750
I still remember their
faces which await me.

1138
01:08:47,792 --> 01:08:51,917
When I came here,
I said I will do so much..

1139
01:08:52,208 --> 01:08:54,542
..that seven generations of
ours won't have to work to survive.

1140
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:58,667
And you?
Have you forgotten everything?

1141
01:08:59,958 --> 01:09:01,292
You used to ride rickshaw in Kutch.

1142
01:09:01,458 --> 01:09:03,000
And now you own buses.

1143
01:09:03,167 --> 01:09:03,917
And you?

1144
01:09:04,833 --> 01:09:06,417
You had a small restaurant.

1145
01:09:06,875 --> 01:09:09,000
Now you and your family lack nothing.

1146
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:11,583
You got everything.
Everyone got everything.

1147
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:15,625
Don't bow your head. Look up.

1148
01:09:17,208 --> 01:09:19,750
Forget.. forget it!

1149
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,000
There is no turning back now.

1150
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:27,500
We have come so far that if we
make even the smallest of mistakes..

1151
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,375
..then neither will
those faces survive..

1152
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:34,000
..nor those families, nor those eyes.

1153
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:36,708
Come in.

1154
01:09:37,167 --> 01:09:38,292
Open your eyes!

1155
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:39,042
Brothers.. - Come on.

1156
01:09:39,333 --> 01:09:40,708
Some food and clothes for you.

1157
01:09:40,792 --> 01:09:42,958
Change your clothes,
you guys are stinking.

1158
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,125
It has been three days.

1159
01:09:44,917 --> 01:09:47,667
Did he say anything?

1160
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,292
He didn't leave him
in a state to speak up.

1161
01:09:49,875 --> 01:09:51,708
He gave him such a punch
that he still didn't wake up?

1162
01:09:52,042 --> 01:09:53,833
I request you to
take him away from here.

1163
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:57,208
My father will throw me
out if he finds out about this.

1164
01:09:57,292 --> 01:09:59,333
Tell them.
- Yes, his father will throw him out.

1165
01:09:59,417 --> 01:10:01,375
He isn't going anywhere.

1166
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,958
Show him his father's photo.

1167
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:06,417
Now, do you recognize him?

1168
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:08,542
Speak up.

1169
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:12,458
Brother, I think he
needs a repeat service.

1170
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:13,833
He will then start speaking up.

1171
01:10:14,042 --> 01:10:16,542
Tell me something, what has he done?

1172
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:17,292
Why?

1173
01:10:17,792 --> 01:10:18,833
You..!

1174
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:23,333
Brother.. Tell them.

1175
01:10:23,417 --> 01:10:24,833
He is very stubborn.

1176
01:10:25,542 --> 01:10:27,958
We have beaten him black and
blue yet he hasn't spoken a word.

1177
01:10:28,292 --> 01:10:31,542
Brother, I hope you aren't
doing anything illegal.

1178
01:10:32,042 --> 01:10:32,625
Brother..

1179
01:10:33,667 --> 01:10:34,042
Brother..

1180
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:36,542
Don't worry.
We aren't doing anything illegal.

1181
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:37,750
Dollar?

1182
01:10:38,417 --> 01:10:39,417
He is right. - Sure?

1183
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:40,333
They aren't doing anything illegal.

1184
01:10:40,417 --> 01:10:42,167
Close the door on your way out.
- Yes, we will.

1185
01:10:42,250 --> 01:10:44,042
You..!
- Let's go.

1186
01:10:44,125 --> 01:10:44,792
Speak up!

1187
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:46,833
Speak up!

1188
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:48,792
Speak up!

1189
01:10:49,333 --> 01:10:50,708
Speak up!

1190
01:11:28,167 --> 01:11:29,583
Harpal..
- Yes, brother?

1191
01:11:29,958 --> 01:11:34,542
Make something that
can be heard till Delhi.

1192
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:09,625
Ranjeet, where are
these wires coming from?

1193
01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:11,208
Come, let's go and check.

1194
01:12:16,125 --> 01:12:18,000
(Phone Ringing)

1195
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:23,042
Yes, brother?

1196
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:25,208
Jagjeet? You still haven't come here?

1197
01:12:25,375 --> 01:12:27,458
My job is done. I am coming soon.

1198
01:12:27,667 --> 01:12:29,208
Come soon, we have to leave.

1199
01:12:29,875 --> 01:12:31,167
Yes, hurry up.
- Okay.

1200
01:12:31,792 --> 01:12:32,625
(Door Opens)

1201
01:12:35,792 --> 01:12:36,792
(Door Closes)

1202
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,917
You..! Get it out!
Get it out of your mouth!

1203
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:40,458
Get it out!

1204
01:12:40,542 --> 01:12:41,667
Give it here.

1205
01:12:46,917 --> 01:12:49,750
Tell us! Tell us what your plan is!

1206
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:56,500
No matter what you do, you won't
hear the evening Jakara (ovation).

1207
01:13:09,542 --> 01:13:12,500
Langar Hall.
Dukh Bhanjani Beri. Akal Takht Sahib.

1208
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:14,917
This is the place.

1209
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:15,708
This is the place.

1210
01:13:16,042 --> 01:13:16,667
Find it.

1211
01:13:17,042 --> 01:13:18,083
Find it. It is over here.

1212
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:42,458
What is this?

1213
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,000
This is what we were looking for.

1214
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:46,292
But how will we defuse it?

1215
01:13:46,833 --> 01:13:48,250
This isn't our cup of tea, brother.

1216
01:13:48,792 --> 01:13:51,417
We'll have to find the rest of the bombs
and take them away from the Gurudwara.

1217
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:53,750
And we have to this before the Jakara.

1218
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:56,167
But they don't call out
the Jakara at the Darbar Sahib.

1219
01:13:58,125 --> 01:13:59,625
But it is said at
the Akal Takht Sahib.

1220
01:14:00,042 --> 01:14:01,625
Five minutes after prayers
are said at the Darbar Sahib..

1221
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,750
..prayers are said at the Akal Takht
Sahib and then call out the Jakara.

1222
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,792
We have to save the Gurudwara,
brother.

1223
01:14:08,417 --> 01:14:09,500
We don't have much time.

1224
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:10,417
Let's go.

1225
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:11,625
Let's go.
- Let's go.

1226
01:14:12,125 --> 01:14:13,417
Jagjeet still hasn't come.

1227
01:14:13,625 --> 01:14:15,292
Call him up.
- Okay, brother.

1228
01:14:15,458 --> 01:14:17,167
(Phone Beeps)

1229
01:14:18,083 --> 01:14:20,042
(Phone Ringing)

1230
01:14:20,750 --> 01:14:21,583
What happened?

1231
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:23,417
He isn't answering it.

1232
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,917
Give it to me.
"He isn't answering it."

1233
01:14:32,958 --> 01:14:34,250
He isn't answering the phone?

1234
01:14:35,292 --> 01:14:36,375
Sukhwinder.
- Yes?

1235
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:37,333
Quickly go and check.

1236
01:14:37,542 --> 01:14:38,500
You too go.
- Okay, brother.

1237
01:14:38,583 --> 01:14:39,583
Call me up.
- Okay.

1238
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,292
Okay?
- Okay, brother.

1239
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:55,000
Check over there.
I will be right back. - Okay.

1240
01:15:22,958 --> 01:15:23,792
What are you looking at?

1241
01:15:25,208 --> 01:15:26,125
Can you see that bag?

1242
01:15:27,917 --> 01:15:29,500
It has been hanging
there from quiet some time.

1243
01:15:29,875 --> 01:15:31,750
Devotees are coming,
having a bath and leaving.

1244
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:34,167
But no one is taking that bag.

1245
01:15:35,375 --> 01:15:36,333
Come with me.

1246
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:00,833
Keep the bag there,
or they will suspect us.

1247
01:16:01,125 --> 01:16:02,000
Let's go.
- Let's go.

1248
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:08,000
Jagjeet!
- Jagjeet!

1249
01:16:15,792 --> 01:16:16,625
It's not here.

1250
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,458
(Phone Beeps)

1251
01:16:26,583 --> 01:16:28,500
(Phone Ringing)

1252
01:16:29,083 --> 01:16:30,250
Come out..

1253
01:16:32,958 --> 01:16:33,458
Yes, tell me.

1254
01:16:33,542 --> 01:16:35,625
Brother, Jagjeet.. Jagjeet.

1255
01:16:35,708 --> 01:16:36,500
What happened to Jagjeet?

1256
01:16:36,583 --> 01:16:38,000
Someone killed Jagjeet, brother.

1257
01:16:38,375 --> 01:16:39,375
And the parcel is also missing.

1258
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:42,500
What did you say?
The parcel is missing?

1259
01:16:42,958 --> 01:16:45,083
This means they have reached there.

1260
01:16:46,083 --> 01:16:47,458
Listen to me very carefully.
- Okay.

1261
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:51,250
Go to all the places and
check properly and find them!

1262
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:54,000
Our mission shouldn't fail.

1263
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:55,292
Okay, brother.

1264
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,792
"Lord Almighty."

Hello brother, there is a problem?

1280

There is a problem?

1281
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:31,958
The parcel at Dukh
Bhanjani Beri is missing.

1282
01:19:32,458 --> 01:19:33,542
And the parcel at Langar
Hall is also missing.

1283
01:19:33,667 --> 01:19:34,917
What are you saying?

1284
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:36,375

It is not so easy.

1289

It is not so easy to uproot us!

1290
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:43,083
Just a few more moment
and then.. boom!

1291

I think you aren't
aware of our history.

1292
01:20:48,958 --> 01:20:50,625
You should try going through
the past pages of history.

1293
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:54,917
Whenever someone has tried to have
evil intentions about our Gurudwaras..

1294
01:20:55,083 --> 01:20:57,625
..we have made them meet the ground.

We don't have much time.

1303

The prayers have already
begun at Darbar Sahib.

1304

I will shoot you.

1312
01:25:12,708 --> 01:25:13,833
Why are you staring at each other?

Keep them down.

1314

Why don't you listen to me?
I will shoot you.

Keep them down. - Sir! Please sir!

1442
01:35:58,958 --> 01:36:00,083
He is the one, sir.

1443
01:36:00,292 --> 01:36:01,958
My friends had brought him here.

1444
01:36:02,625 --> 01:36:06,500
Sir, there is something that
he knows but won't tell anyone.

1445
01:36:07,333 --> 01:36:09,750
My friends are innocent, sir.
They are innocent.

1446
01:36:09,833 --> 01:36:10,958
I know, son.

1447
01:36:11,583 --> 01:36:12,625
I know everything.

1448
01:36:13,083 --> 01:36:14,208
Stupid..

1449
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:20,625
You have relieved me of
great burden with your phone call.

1450
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:25,542
You don't know how big
a favor you have done to me.

1451
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:26,542
(Sobbing)

1452
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:30,000
They beat him black and
blue but he doesn't utter a word.

1453
01:36:34,750 --> 01:36:36,250
He shall speak.

1454
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:40,000
He will start talking.

1455
01:36:42,292 --> 01:36:44,208
He will talk like a parrot.

1456
01:36:46,042 --> 01:36:48,583
Suchiya, take him with us.
- Okay, sir.

1457
01:36:54,417 --> 01:36:56,500
Let's go.
- Come on.

1458
01:36:58,042 --> 01:36:59,042
Let's go.

1459
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:23,625
Sucha..

1460
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,583
Start talking quickly.

1461
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:50,375
If you don't,
then I swear, I won't stop.

1462
01:37:50,583 --> 01:37:54,333
Bashir Mohammad, Girnur
Gila village, Karachi, Pakistan.

1463
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:59,750
Sir, we had been given a mission..

1464
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:03,708
..to blast bombs inside
Harmandir Sahib on Diwali..

1465
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:07,292
..and massacre Sikhs.

1466
01:38:08,125 --> 01:38:11,083
So that it causes a rift
between Hindu, Sikhs and Muslims.

1467
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:12,625
To make them fight each other.

1468
01:38:13,208 --> 01:38:14,875
To disturb the peace of this place.

1469
01:38:15,667 --> 01:38:17,000
To divide it.

1470
01:38:18,875 --> 01:38:24,125
We wanted to do what
Blue Star couldn't do.

1471
01:38:24,292 --> 01:38:25,625
Sir, he is Muslim!

1472
01:38:25,708 --> 01:38:28,167
He cannot be a Muslim!

1473
01:38:33,625 --> 01:38:37,458
The place, the abode which
they conspired to blow up..

1474
01:38:37,542 --> 01:38:43,333
..it's foundation was laid
by a Muslim fakir, Sai Mian Mir.

1475
01:38:44,792 --> 01:38:46,375
How can he be a Muslim?

1476
01:38:46,542 --> 01:38:48,958
They don't have any caste or creed.

1477
01:38:49,625 --> 01:38:54,583
For some money and some false dreams,
he can do anything.

1478
01:39:00,667 --> 01:39:02,083
Disgusting!

1479
01:39:05,333 --> 01:39:06,917
Because of..

1480
01:39:07,542 --> 01:39:13,083
Because of few such people, we are
being separated from our dear ones.

1481
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:15,417
Why?

1482
01:39:16,042 --> 01:39:17,083
Till when?

1483
01:39:23,375 --> 01:39:24,708
They weren't traitors.

1484
01:39:26,625 --> 01:39:27,750
They weren't.

1485
01:39:31,208 --> 01:39:32,542
They are martyrs.

1486
01:39:34,458 --> 01:39:40,000
They sacrificed their lives
in order to save the Gurudwara.

1487
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:46,708
Their mothers are great for
giving birth to such brave boys.

1488
01:39:48,875 --> 01:39:54,542
We are indebted to that mother
and that father and that family..

1489
01:39:55,833 --> 01:39:57,458
And we shall always stay indebted.

1490
01:39:57,917 --> 01:40:01,083
And if anyone tries to look
at that place with evil intention..

1491
01:40:03,333 --> 01:40:05,125
We won't be able to tolerate it.

1492
01:40:05,792 --> 01:40:07,042
We don't accept it.

1493
01:40:09,333 --> 01:40:12,375
And these brave boys have once again
proven that we still have the courage..

1494
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:22,000
..to gouge the eyes of those who look
at the Gurudwara will evil intentions.

1495
01:40:23,708 --> 01:40:29,292
We are proud of this army of our Guru.

1496
01:40:30,125 --> 01:40:31,958
We are proud of them.

1497
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:36,625
Khalsa belongs to Lord.

1498
01:40:37,958 --> 01:40:40,000
Victory belongs to Lord.

1499
01:40:41,583 --> 01:40:43,750
One question, sir.

1500
01:40:44,167 --> 01:40:47,167
Like SHO Zorawar
Singh just disclosed..

1501
01:40:47,250 --> 01:40:49,500
..Gurtej and Ranjeet weren't traitors.

1502
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:53,000
Instead, they sacrificed
their lives to save the Gurudwara.

1503
01:40:53,208 --> 01:40:54,875
If the unfortunate
incident had taken place..

1504
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,167
..then it is possible that
it could have caused riots between..

1505
01:40:57,375 --> 01:41:00,042
..Hindu, Sikhs and Muslims,
all across the country.

1506
01:41:00,250 --> 01:41:03,042
So these young boys without
caring for their lives..

1507
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:05,042
..stopped this unfortunate
incident from taking place.

1508
01:41:05,167 --> 01:41:08,292
Along with Cameraman Tulsi Mehrat,
Diljeet Singh, PTC News, Amritsar.

1509
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:17,167
I salute this pious land of Punjab.

1510
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:25,375
I salute the brave mothers
which gave birth to such brave boys.

1511
01:41:26,042 --> 01:41:31,542
Thanks to their sacrifice,
our community is feeling proud.

1512
01:42:31,208 --> 01:42:34,167
(Car Brakes Squeaking)

1513
01:42:38,375 --> 01:42:40,708
The martyrs' bodies have
reached the village square.

1514
01:42:40,792 --> 01:42:42,750
Please pay your last respects to them.

1515
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:44,375
My son is here.

1516
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:45,667
My son is here.

1517
01:42:47,458 --> 01:42:48,625
My son is here.

1518
01:42:49,083 --> 01:42:50,250
My son is here.

1519
01:42:50,458 --> 01:42:52,667
Sister-in-law..
- My son is here.

1520
01:42:57,208 --> 01:42:59,083
(Sobbing)

1521
01:43:02,292 --> 01:43:03,292
Ranjeet?

1522
01:43:03,708 --> 01:43:06,917
My son! - Why do we
have to face such a day?

1523
01:43:07,208 --> 01:43:10,417
(Crying)

1524
01:43:12,417 --> 01:43:17,417
Oh God, how did this happen?
- Ranjeet!

1525
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:22,708
You used to say that you wouldn't
give a medal to your father.

1526
01:43:25,083 --> 01:43:29,458
Now tell me,
what will we do without you?

1527
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,583
Brother!

1528
01:43:51,875 --> 01:43:53,083
Brother!

1529
01:43:59,583 --> 01:44:00,375
Get up.

1530
01:44:00,750 --> 01:44:01,583
Calm down.

1531
01:44:03,875 --> 01:44:04,792
Hello.

1532
01:44:05,667 --> 01:44:06,917
Mother, you are great.

1533
01:44:07,833 --> 01:44:12,625
You are great to give
birth to such a brave child.

1534
01:44:13,792 --> 01:44:16,292
Mother, I pay my respects to you.

1535
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,375
You left us.

1536
01:44:25,958 --> 01:44:27,167
Brother!

1537
01:44:34,833 --> 01:44:35,250
No..

1538
01:44:35,333 --> 01:44:37,750
Please forgive me, son.

1539
01:44:37,833 --> 01:44:39,917
No, don't cry.

1540
01:44:41,292 --> 01:44:44,917
Don't create an obstacle
in his path by crying.

1541
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,792
Sister, you should
feel proud of your brother.

1542
01:44:50,208 --> 01:44:53,083
He sacrificed his life for his Guru.

1543
01:44:56,542 --> 01:44:57,708
Good girl.

1544
01:44:58,417 --> 01:44:59,250
God bless you.

1545
01:45:00,125 --> 01:45:01,042
Good girl.

1546
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:41,833
(Music Playing)

1547
01:45:45,042 --> 01:45:50,542
"You are going somewhere,
from where you shall never return."

1548
01:45:50,625 --> 01:45:56,167
"I'd no longer be
able to call you back."

1549
01:45:56,750 --> 01:46:01,750
"I'd now never wake
up hearing your voice."

1550
01:46:02,208 --> 01:46:03,833
"Hearing your voice."

1551
01:46:03,917 --> 01:46:09,333
"I will now dwell in
your heart as your heartbeat."

1552
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:12,083
"In your heart.."

1553
01:46:12,333 --> 01:46:15,000
"In your heart.."

1554
01:46:16,042 --> 01:46:21,500
"My brother is getting married today."

1555
01:46:21,583 --> 01:46:25,458
"It's time for me to celebrate."

1556
01:46:26,917 --> 01:46:32,875
"I will ward off the
evil from over his head."

1557
01:46:33,042 --> 01:46:38,000
"My son has brought
his bride with him."

1558
01:46:38,292 --> 01:46:43,708
"Congratulate me.
Congratulate me, everyone."

1559
01:46:43,917 --> 01:46:49,333
"Today my brother
is dressed as a groom."

1560
01:46:51,375 --> 01:46:56,625
"I will now dwell in
your heart as your heartbeat."

1561
01:46:56,708 --> 01:47:02,042
"I will now dwell in
your heart as your heartbeat."

1562
01:47:02,208 --> 01:47:04,458
"In your heart.."

1563
01:47:05,042 --> 01:47:08,000
"In your heart.."

1564
01:47:27,833 --> 01:47:33,083
"I will shed as tears from your eyes."

1565
01:47:33,417 --> 01:47:38,875
"I will be the wind and hug you."

1566
01:47:38,958 --> 01:47:44,375
"I will be the sound
of your bangles and tinkle."

1567
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:49,875
"I will be the tune
that resounds in the ears."

1568
01:47:50,042 --> 01:47:57,375
"I will shower into
your courtyard as rain."

1569
01:47:57,625 --> 01:48:03,042
"I will now dwell in
your heart as your heartbeat."

1570
01:48:03,083 --> 01:48:08,625
"I will now dwell in
your heart as your heartbeat."

1571
01:48:08,750 --> 01:48:14,250

your heart as your heartbeat."

"In your heart.."

1574
01:48:44,750 --> 01:48:51,375
"I will be a bird and
look at you through leaves."

1575
01:48:51,458 --> 01:48:56,750
"I will be dry grass you
burn and give your warmth."

1576
01:49:01,833 --> 01:49:08,042
"I will be a bird and
look at you through leaves."

1577
01:49:08,083 --> 01:49:13,208
"I will be dry grass you
burn and give your warmth."

1578
01:49:13,625 --> 01:49:21,083
"I will be the milk to nourish you."

1579
01:49:21,167 --> 01:49:26,458
"I will now dwell in
your heart as your heartbeat."

1580
01:49:26,542 --> 01:49:31,958
"I will now dwell in
your heart as your heartbeat."

1581
01:49:32,042 --> 01:49:37,542
"I will now dwell in
your heart as your heartbeat."
