You have really been amazing.

48
00:08:07,723 --> 00:08:09,684
Suneeta has been amazing,
principal sir.

49
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:12,323
- Her acting was really very natural.
- Thank you.

50
00:08:12,403 --> 00:08:16,198
And I fully believe the second
drama we are going to enact..

00:08:16,278 --> 00:08:18,345
From our college is going
to be more successful.

52
00:08:19,603 --> 00:08:21,323
But I will surely say
one thing, Suneeta.

53
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:24,603
You will have to pay a lot of
attention to your get up.

54
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:26,538
Don't worry.

55
00:08:26,698 --> 00:08:27,834
I will wear such a get
up that you won't be..

56
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:28,943
Able to recognize me either.

57
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,130
Everyone can be cheated but not me.

58
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:33,018
As soon as I see you,
I will recognize..

59
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,657
Who is real and
who is counterfeit.

60
00:08:36,874 --> 00:08:39,018
As soon as I see you,
I will recognize..

61
00:08:39,097 --> 00:08:40,577
Who is real and
who is counterfeit.

62
00:09:13,538 --> 00:09:15,224
Greetings, principal sir.

63
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,416
Greetings, come.

64
00:09:23,658 --> 00:09:26,414
- Sit.
- Live long, dear.

65
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:30,415
I am sorry. I didn't recognize you.

66
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,498
How will you recognize me?

67
00:09:34,138 --> 00:09:37,378
Nowadays even the children don't
recognize their aged parents.

68
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,794
Yes, there are such
useless children too.

69
00:09:40,456 --> 00:09:43,298
- Make the children able like you.
- Yes.

70
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:49,889
I am Asharani's granny.
I have come to fetch her.

71
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,698
Okay. Okay. I will just call her.

72
00:09:56,098 --> 00:09:59,098
- Yes, sir.
- Look, call Asharani from B.A. B section.

73
00:09:59,178 --> 00:10:00,258
All right.

74
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:03,418
I have gone to your place once,
but I didn't see you.

75
00:10:04,018 --> 00:10:05,138
How will you see?

76
00:10:05,618 --> 00:10:09,498
Nowadays old age is behind curtains
and youth is on the roads.

77
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:14,658
- Yes, sir.
- Asha, your granny has come to fetch you.

78
00:10:18,605 --> 00:10:21,402
You have at last called
your granny to college.

79
00:10:21,738 --> 00:10:22,818
Greetings, granny.

80
00:10:23,098 --> 00:10:24,178
Greetings.

81
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:26,226
Pardon me, principal.

82
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,778
This love called disease has
not reached your college.

83
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:31,378
I didn't understand.

84
00:10:32,938 --> 00:10:37,427
I mean to say that the children
studying in this college..

85
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:43,373
Is less interested in studying
and more in.. Leave it.

86
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:45,338
I feel ashamed even saying it.

87
00:10:46,508 --> 00:10:50,218
In our age, first
marriage then love.

88
00:10:51,197 --> 00:10:56,538
Today a boy is coming to see her.
Tell her to get married.

89
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:58,458
Why won't she, if you tell her to?

90
00:10:59,035 --> 00:11:02,578
These people consider
us to be insane.

91
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:09,018
Well, I am very happy to know
that no one can leave class..

92
00:11:09,098 --> 00:11:11,178
Without the arrival
of grand parents.

93
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:12,738
What can I do, mother?

94
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,723
Some naughty students
make some excuse..

95
00:11:14,803 --> 00:11:16,578
And run away from college.

96
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,218
That's why we have to be strict.

97
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:21,498
Very good, dear. Very good.

98
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:27,466
Otherwise girls nowadays even
fool their principals.

99
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:32,629
Asha, your principal
is very innocent.

100
00:11:34,209 --> 00:11:38,386
All right, I will leave
then. Greetings.

101
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,778
- Greetings.
- Come Asha.

102
00:11:53,117 --> 00:11:54,536
- Hi Asha.
- Hi.

103
00:11:54,725 --> 00:11:57,538
Ashok, granny is to be thanked
for our meeting, today.

104
00:11:57,618 --> 00:11:59,481
- Greetings, granny.
- Greetings, dear.

105
00:12:00,048 --> 00:12:03,018
Asha these clandestine
meetings are not good.

106
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:06,498
Make your Ashok a groom and
call him to your house.

107
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:09,698
- I will become a groom soon, granny.
- Come, Ashok.

108
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,538
Wow, dear.

109
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:14,898
You are biding this old lady
farewell, as you have met your lover.

110
00:12:15,332 --> 00:12:17,697
Listen, first drop me
at Suneeta's house..

111
00:12:17,777 --> 00:12:19,377
And then you can go
wherever you want.

112
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:22,034
Come.

113
00:12:23,088 --> 00:12:24,210
Come, granny.

114
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,658
Today you are looking so beautiful.

115
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,498
You always say the same thing.

116
00:12:54,237 --> 00:12:57,018
Then am I wrong. Glance
at the mirror.

117
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:58,898
Your own evil eye will be cast.

118
00:13:00,522 --> 00:13:03,954
Let God will and the
boys people like you.

119
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,818
And this alliance should
get fixed today.

120
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,063
The alliance will be fixed.
They will like the girl too.

121
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:16,063
Which fool won't like
this moon like face?

122
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:20,778
- What is your name, dear?
- Uma. - Uma

123
00:13:21,171 --> 00:13:23,441
You are really the form of Uma.

124
00:13:25,455 --> 00:13:29,338
Uma's mother, your daughter will
become the wealth of our house.

125
00:13:29,874 --> 00:13:35,018
- But, who are you?
- I didn't say who I am till now.

126
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:38,018
I am boy's grandma.

127
00:13:39,306 --> 00:13:40,458
Grandma.

128
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:42,378
Come, come.

129
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:44,018
Come, dear.

130
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:47,603
Dear, I like your daughter.

131
00:13:47,683 --> 00:13:49,522
- Sister. Sister. Sister.
- What is it?

132
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:50,632
The groom's people have come.

133
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:53,088
Yes, yes, the boy's granny
has already come.

134
00:13:53,887 --> 00:13:55,098
Grandma?

135
00:13:57,752 --> 00:14:00,378
But its 20 years since the
boy's granny has died.

136
00:14:01,902 --> 00:14:04,037
Hey, who are you?

137
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:08,018
Who, Suneeta?

138
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:08,928
Yes, mother.

139
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:11,738
I had dressed myself as an old
lady for the drama in college.

140
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:13,820
I was joking with Uma sister.

141
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:16,698
Aren't you ashamed to
crack such jokes?

142
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,098
I am worried sick about
her marriage here.

143
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:22,378
- And you are thinking about jokes.
- Sister.

144
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,860
Forgive me, sister.

145
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,138
I didn't know that they
are going to see you now.

146
00:14:27,361 --> 00:14:29,378
- Have you forgiven me?
- I did.

147
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:34,058
Hey, Bare Dayaram come, come. Sit.

148
00:14:34,698 --> 00:14:36,178
- Greetings.
- Sit.

149
00:14:36,685 --> 00:14:38,833
I am sorry, we were a little late.

150
00:14:38,913 --> 00:14:41,058
So what? You had to come home only.

151
00:14:42,116 --> 00:14:43,954
Daughter Uma, bring some tea.

152
00:14:44,211 --> 00:14:46,724
- Did you have any problem in your journey?
- Oh no.

153
00:15:00,102 --> 00:15:01,298
Live long.

154
00:15:04,413 --> 00:15:06,258
Karuna Shankar, what is the matter?

155
00:15:07,062 --> 00:15:08,698
The girl is not walking properly.

156
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,858
How will the girl walk properly?
She is lame. Lame.

157
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,578
Karuna Shankar, I had told you
before that tell everything.

158
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:22,018
Sister, I thought they
wouldn't have noticed..

159
00:15:22,098 --> 00:15:24,258
One negative aspect by seeing
her beauty and skills.

160
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,778
Will anyone swallow a fly after
seeing it? Come, come.

161
00:15:28,114 --> 00:15:31,628
Sister, you are also a woman.
You have children too.

162
00:15:31,817 --> 00:15:34,384
Wow, what happened
if I have children?

163
00:15:34,464 --> 00:15:36,278
Shall I take this lame girl
home as a daughter-in-law?

164
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:39,803
Satish's mother, if Uma's
mother wants to present..

165
00:15:39,883 --> 00:15:42,138
This case with another
aspect then?

166
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:47,357
Only God can was the stain, God
has implemented on the moon.

167
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:49,738
It is not like that, Uma's mother.

168
00:15:50,154 --> 00:15:55,738
We can right the ailment in your
daughter's leg God has given.

169
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:58,291
Money covers all that is ugly.

170
00:15:58,371 --> 00:16:00,018
And that people from
Chandpur are giving..

171
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:02,618
10,000 cash along with
a scooter for Satish.

172
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:06,858
Leave the scooter. Uma's
mother will give 11,000.

173
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:09,318
11,000?

174
00:16:09,656 --> 00:16:13,018
Mother, these two are
increasing the price..

175
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:15,018
Of their son in the
marriage market.

176
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:16,858
They need a fat dowry.

177
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:18,818
It is matter of intentions, dear.

178
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:23,018
You can swallow a bitter pill
better by wrapping it in sugar.

179
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:27,018
And a lame girl can get married
with the support of money.

180
00:16:28,061 --> 00:16:32,058
What did you say? I don't
want anyone's support.

181
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,058
I don't want to live being
dependent on anyone.

182
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:41,018
And mother, if I am a burden
to you, then kill me.

183
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:45,458
Strangle me. I am always
being insulted.

184
00:16:47,613 --> 00:16:51,418
You merchant of marriage. I
don't want to get married.

185
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,234
I don't want to get married.
Get out from here.

186
00:16:54,424 --> 00:16:57,178
- Karuna Shankar.
- Get out from here.

187
00:16:58,978 --> 00:17:00,818
They have come to support me.

188
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,177
From where do I get so much dowry?

189
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:14,537
If I had around 5,000, then
wouldn't I have my daughter treated?

190
00:17:15,383 --> 00:17:18,818
The doctor had said so any times,
her leg can be cured.

191
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,531
But, but nothing can
happen without money.

192
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:33,218
- Sir.
- What is the matter, Suneeta?

193
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,098
- You know that my sister is lame.
- The poor girl.

194
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:39,018
Who knows how she will
spend her life?

195
00:17:39,479 --> 00:17:41,969
She will recover if I take her to
the city and have her operated.

196
00:17:41,993 --> 00:17:45,018
That's good. Have her operated
as soon as possible.

197
00:17:45,304 --> 00:17:47,371
You can take as much
leave as you want.

198
00:17:47,451 --> 00:17:50,357
You are very kind. You have
to do one more kindness.

199
00:17:50,722 --> 00:17:53,378
I need 5,000 rupees
for the operation.

200
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,578
You can give it and deduct
it from my salary.

201
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:59,658
- Only 5,000 rupees.
- Yes. - Do you take me to be mad?

202
00:18:00,168 --> 00:18:01,874
I don't have money to give
for charity. Understand?

203
00:18:01,898 --> 00:18:06,738
Go and work. Go. She needs
money, the crazy girl.

204
00:18:07,357 --> 00:18:09,338
Everyone asks money.
Everyone asks money.

205
00:18:09,418 --> 00:18:10,698
Wow, what is it?

206
00:18:11,114 --> 00:18:13,378
Come, what is it? What do you want?

207
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,498
I want to meet Suneeta.

208
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:16,658
You want to meet Suneeta?

209
00:18:16,738 --> 00:18:19,058
If you want to meet Suneeta
then go to her house, madam.

210
00:18:19,138 --> 00:18:20,750
This is not a house but a shop.
Do you understand?

211
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:22,626
Sir, this is the judge's daughter.

212
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:24,735
I am sorry, I didn't recognize you.

213
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:25,518
You want to meet Suneeta.

214
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:27,338
There she is. Go. Go.

215
00:18:30,436 --> 00:18:32,538
- Suneeta.
- Asha you.

216
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:35,464
I have told daddy, I am
going to your house.

217
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:38,816
- You are not going home?
- No. I am going out with Ashok.

218
00:18:38,896 --> 00:18:42,378
- If father asks anything then manage it. Okay?
- Okay.

219
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,338
Ashok is sitting in
the car. I will go.

220
00:18:50,018 --> 00:18:52,178
- Come, let's go.
- Why? So soon.

221
00:18:53,085 --> 00:18:58,018
- See, the sun is setting.
- But it is not dark yet.

222
00:18:58,207 --> 00:19:00,018
Come, the shameless person.

223
00:19:03,815 --> 00:19:04,975
Asha.

224
00:19:05,977 --> 00:19:07,370
Who will pick up these books?

225
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:19,498
What is the time?

226
00:19:20,842 --> 00:19:22,977
- Answer me.
- Seven.

227
00:19:23,477 --> 00:19:26,573
You know, that I don't like
you to come late at all.

228
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:28,538
Daddy, I went to Suneeta for..

229
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:31,298
I didn't ask you, why
you went to Suneeta?

230
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,418
I won't be late in
the future, daddy.

231
00:19:34,505 --> 00:19:37,330
- The reason to send the driver home.
- The reason.

232
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:39,098
There is no reason.

233
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:43,658
Asha, I don't like these
meaningless talks at all.

234
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:46,458
Don't forget that you are
the daughter of a judge.

235
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,778
You can leave.

236
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:58,138
Sister, like the moon stain, you can
see even a little effect in a girl.

237
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:01,098
The problem in her leg had covered
all of Uma's skills.

238
00:20:01,316 --> 00:20:04,018
Though Uma is not less
than Suneeta in beauty.

239
00:20:04,586 --> 00:20:08,178
The one who sees her, he doesn't
even pay heed to Uma.

240
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:11,178
If you want, can I find
an alliance for Suneeta?

241
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:16,418
- Ramprasad and Gangaprasad, both are ready.
- Is it?

242
00:20:17,073 --> 00:20:20,658
- Then fix her marriage.
- No, mother.

243
00:20:22,236 --> 00:20:25,058
I won't get married till
sister gets married.

244
00:20:25,138 --> 00:20:30,298
Daughter, you can see
who will marry Uma?

245
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:32,578
Then listen to my oath too, mother.

246
00:20:33,102 --> 00:20:36,018
I won't get married till
sister gets married.

247
00:21:21,857 --> 00:21:25,425
- Sister. What are you doing?
- Let me die. - Sister.

248
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:27,058
- Let me die.
- Don't be insane.

249
00:21:27,138 --> 00:21:29,698
Sister, life is to live.

250
00:21:29,778 --> 00:21:33,818
For me death is equal to life.

251
00:21:34,317 --> 00:21:38,574
If I die, mother will be unburdened.

252
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:43,098
This marriage. I will be freed
from these marriage problems.

253
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:48,778
Till now, I have remained an enemy
to your and mother's happiness.

254
00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:50,658
Sister, you are misunderstanding.

255
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:54,018
This mistake of yours will
become an enemy to mother.

256
00:21:54,098 --> 00:21:58,100
- People will talk.
- No, no I won't return home.

257
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:02,128
All right, if you want
to die then come.

258
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:03,584
Both sisters will die together.

259
00:22:03,658 --> 00:22:10,383
- No, you won't die with me. We will live together.
- Sister.

260
00:22:13,018 --> 00:22:18,178
Sister. If you want me to live,
forget this idea to die.

261
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,458
There is no sin greater
than suicide.

262
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:26,858
Sister, return home. Come
back home, sister.

263
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,018
Suneeta, you are sitting here.

264
00:22:30,234 --> 00:22:31,834
I have been searching
for you since long.

265
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,898
- What are you reading?
- The drama of life.

266
00:22:37,544 --> 00:22:39,538
But the book is closed.

267
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:42,698
But the book of our life is open.

268
00:22:43,652 --> 00:22:45,220
In every page, words
of helplessness..

269
00:22:45,612 --> 00:22:47,778
And vulnerability
are coming forward.

270
00:22:47,858 --> 00:22:52,818
But queen, you even force poverty
and helplessness to laugh.

271
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:56,018
Is this really sadness or
you are acting sadness.

272
00:22:56,423 --> 00:22:59,802
This is not a drama, Asha.
This is reality.

273
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:03,018
God is enjoying with us.

274
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:06,924
And is punishing Uma sister
for His mistake.

275
00:23:07,194 --> 00:23:09,458
What is the matter?
Tell me truthfully.

276
00:23:12,168 --> 00:23:14,058
I cannot see sister's pain.

277
00:23:15,208 --> 00:23:18,396
Since that poor girl is lame,
she cannot get married.

278
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:21,018
And my poor mother doesn't
have money..

279
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:23,578
That's why she cannot
have her treated.

280
00:23:24,193 --> 00:23:27,418
- Can her legs become well?
- Yes.

281
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,180
The doctor says, the leg can
get well by operation.

282
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,018
Why didn't you tell
me all this before?

283
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:40,098
Thinking that even our shadow
leave us in darkness.

284
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:41,816
Suneeta.

285
00:23:43,086 --> 00:23:46,538
I am sorry, that you don't consider
me to be your friend.

286
00:23:47,112 --> 00:23:49,018
You don't consider me
to be your companion.

287
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:52,858
Your pain is my pain, Suneeta.

288
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:57,258
Tell mother that Asha will give
money for Uma's treatment.

289
00:24:00,031 --> 00:24:04,978
Asha the day, people will forget
love and friendship..

290
00:24:07,031 --> 00:24:10,098
That day the name of God will
be erased from man's heart.

291
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,028
Asha.

292
00:24:19,578 --> 00:24:22,313
I am coming straight
home from college.

293
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,381
But today you came
earlier than usual.

294
00:24:25,706 --> 00:24:27,786
Today I have come to talk
something special with you.

295
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,449
Tell me, daddy.

296
00:24:29,529 --> 00:24:32,018
Since it will interfere your
studies I didn't think..

297
00:24:32,098 --> 00:24:36,738
Right to tell you that your
marriage has been fixed with Suresh.

298
00:24:37,002 --> 00:24:38,732
- Suresh?
- Yes. - Who is Suresh?

299
00:24:39,191 --> 00:24:42,578
The only son of my old friend
Rai Babu Chandra Mohan.

300
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,418
They live in London.

301
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:47,872
Your and Suresh's mother had fixed
this alliance in childhood itself.

302
00:24:48,618 --> 00:24:54,759
But unfortunately your mother died
before seeing you as a bride.

303
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:58,292
And now it is my duty
to fulfill her wish.

304
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:01,104
But daddy, I have some wish too.

305
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,252
I have fulfilled every
wish of yours.

306
00:25:04,217 --> 00:25:06,052
This is your parents' wish.

307
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:09,812
But daddy, I have not
even seen this boy.

308
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:11,052
This is his picture.

309
00:25:12,852 --> 00:25:16,023
Suresh is reaching Mumbai the
day after tomorrow from London.

310
00:25:16,372 --> 00:25:19,652
After 20, 25 days Chandra and
sister-in-law will reach there too.

311
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:22,314
They have got a huge
business in Mumbai.

312
00:25:22,574 --> 00:25:23,417
But daddy..

313
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:25,546
I don't want to hear anything
about this matter.

314
00:25:33,654 --> 00:25:37,092
Ashok, is there no other way.

315
00:25:38,292 --> 00:25:42,012
Where I will get both your
love and daddy's blessings?

316
00:25:42,433 --> 00:25:43,772
Tell me, Ashok, tell me.

317
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,796
- Yes, Asha. Your wish can be fulfilled.
- How is that?

318
00:25:50,586 --> 00:25:53,212
- Do one thing. - Yes.
- Suresh doesn't know you, right?

319
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,732
And neither have you known
Suresh. That's it.

320
00:25:56,315 --> 00:25:58,212
Behave in such a way
with him in Mumbai..

321
00:25:58,531 --> 00:26:00,411
That he will himself refuse
for the marriage.

322
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:03,332
But how can I go to Mumbai?

323
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:07,212
And daddy will kill me,
if he gets to know this.

324
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:11,092
Then do one thing. Suresh
lives in London.

325
00:26:12,012 --> 00:26:13,861
He certainly dreams
of an Indian girl.

326
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:17,772
- There is Suneeta. Suneeta.
- Yes. - That's it.

327
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,412
Send her to Mumbai as Asha.

328
00:26:20,132 --> 00:26:24,359
She will act in such a way that
our drama will be successful.

329
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,212
And if daddy gets to know then..

330
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:29,052
How will daddy come to know?

331
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:31,412
He will himself refuse
and go back to London.

332
00:26:31,785 --> 00:26:33,452
Just make Suneeta agree.

333
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:40,652
Suneeta. Suneeta will surely
do this drama for me.

334
00:26:41,428 --> 00:26:43,412
No, no, I cannot perform
such a drama.

335
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,482
This is the question
of my life, Suneeta.

336
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,732
Not me but your daddy can
solve this question.

337
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,612
Why don't you tell him clearly,
you want to marry Ashok.

338
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,252
You don't know daddy's stubbornness.

339
00:26:52,562 --> 00:26:56,022
I know Asha that parents
are not so heartless..

340
00:26:56,465 --> 00:26:58,618
That they will sacrifice their
children's joys for their ego.

341
00:26:58,642 --> 00:27:01,524
Yes, Suneeta. My daddy is like that.

342
00:27:02,616 --> 00:27:05,052
You should have thought all
this before loving Ashok.

343
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:08,652
The time to think all
this has passed.

344
00:27:09,568 --> 00:27:12,372
Now it is time to join the
broken episodes of my love.

345
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,956
Suneeta, I am asking for your help.

346
00:27:16,659 --> 00:27:19,545
This is not help, Asha.
This is cheating someone.

347
00:27:19,837 --> 00:27:21,212
I cannot do such wrong things.

348
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:31,852
Asha you, come, come. Come here.

349
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,372
- Sit.
- What are you doing?

350
00:27:36,736 --> 00:27:38,212
But what are you doing here now?

351
00:27:38,445 --> 00:27:41,212
I had promised 5,000 rupees
for Uma's treatment.

352
00:27:42,024 --> 00:27:43,292
Take these 5,000 rupees.

353
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:46,452
But why do you need to come so
late at night to give money.

354
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,532
I had to give, that's why I came.

355
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:50,212
All right, I will go now.

356
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:57,472
Asha, you are with Ashok
in a taxi instead..

357
00:27:57,764 --> 00:28:01,212
Of your car so late at night.
What is the matter?

358
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:06,212
- Nothing.
- There is surely something.

359
00:28:06,844 --> 00:28:10,012
Are you and Ashok taking
some wrong step?

360
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:11,932
I don't know what is right
and what is wrong.

361
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:16,332
I have left home and I
am going with Ashok.

362
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:21,969
I didn't know Asha that
you can even play..

363
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:24,212
With your father's honor
blinded by love.

364
00:28:25,223 --> 00:28:28,892
Didn't he play with my life by
fixing my marriage in childhood?

365
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,774
Now my happiness and joy
is only Ashok, Suneeta.

366
00:28:33,854 --> 00:28:37,052
But your happiness will dishonor
your daddy, Asha.

367
00:28:37,266 --> 00:28:39,252
He won't be able to face anyone.

368
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,492
I beg you, Asha. Don't commit
such a big mistake.

369
00:28:43,092 --> 00:28:45,012
I have stepped outside home.

370
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,652
Going back home means
marrying Suresh.

371
00:28:48,486 --> 00:28:50,012
And I am not at all ready for this.

372
00:28:53,557 --> 00:28:57,372
All right, I will take a wrong
step to stop your wrong steps.

373
00:28:58,843 --> 00:28:59,965
Truly, Suneeta?

374
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:03,522
Yes, Asha. I, I will do everything
for your happiness.

375
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,784
Tell me, when do I need
to go to Mumbai?

376
00:29:05,922 --> 00:29:08,932
Very soon in a few days.
Take Uma along too.

377
00:29:09,118 --> 00:29:10,492
She will be treated there too.

378
00:29:12,108 --> 00:29:14,732
All right. But go home straight now.

379
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:20,692
I have arranged everything
for your departure.

380
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:24,212
I have also told daddy that
Suneeta is going to Mumbai..

381
00:29:24,292 --> 00:29:26,012
To have her sister treated.

382
00:29:26,501 --> 00:29:29,041
Take this. The keys to
our flat in Mumbai.

383
00:29:29,214 --> 00:29:31,317
And write letters from there
to my address. Okay?

384
00:29:32,168 --> 00:29:33,612
And this is Suresh's picture.

385
00:29:34,099 --> 00:29:36,179
So that you can recognize
him as soon as you see him.

386
00:29:46,629 --> 00:29:47,932
Good morning.

387
00:29:49,092 --> 00:29:51,507
Greetings. Who are you?

388
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:54,332
I am Ganpat uncle.

389
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,652
How do you do? Do. Do.
Do. Do. Do. Do.

390
00:29:59,872 --> 00:30:04,292
- Didn't you recognize me?
- Ganpat uncle. - Yes, me.

391
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,839
You might be some
other Ganpat uncle.

392
00:30:07,054 --> 00:30:08,772
No, I am that same, Ganpat uncle.

393
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:10,972
You have forgotten me
after going abroad.

394
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:14,212
I can never forget my Ganpat uncle.

395
00:30:15,412 --> 00:30:17,212
He used to speak Hindi
mixed with Marathi.

396
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,393
He used to wear dhoti and kurtas
and not suits and pants.

397
00:30:21,383 --> 00:30:22,612
See there.

398
00:30:24,116 --> 00:30:28,612
He is my Ganpat uncle. He
seems so nice and innocent.

399
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:32,232
He used to call as Suresh
Baal (Child) and not sir.

400
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:33,732
Baal. (Child)

401
00:30:37,227 --> 00:30:38,376
Baal (Child) Suresh.

402
00:30:39,572 --> 00:30:40,652
- Come.
- Uncle.

403
00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:45,012
Baal(Child) Suresh. Suresh.

404
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:54,652
You have not forgiven me. But
I couldn't understand you.

405
00:30:56,165 --> 00:31:01,052
Suresh, you are great.
You are great.

406
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:04,012
Uncle, don't be proud of me.

407
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,100
Bring a cup of tea for me quickly.

408
00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:10,572
I will get it. I will get it,
dear. I will get the tea.

409
00:31:17,387 --> 00:31:20,732
Hello. Yes, this is Suresh
Chandra speaking.

410
00:31:21,648 --> 00:31:23,612
Yes, I have arrived from
London today itself.

411
00:31:24,212 --> 00:31:25,292
But who are you?

412
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:32,292
Asha. Greetings. Greetings.
But you in Mumbai?

413
00:31:33,043 --> 00:31:35,395
Yes, look, I have come to Mumbai..

414
00:31:35,475 --> 00:31:38,972
With the excuse of my
friend's treatment.

415
00:31:39,052 --> 00:31:41,372
Excuse? Why an excuse?

416
00:31:41,642 --> 00:31:46,611
Because our parents had fixed our
alliance in childhood itself.

417
00:31:46,756 --> 00:31:48,932
Yes, yes. I know.

418
00:31:49,372 --> 00:31:51,692
But you don't know how am I.

419
00:31:51,932 --> 00:31:53,812
You also don't know, how am I.

420
00:31:54,071 --> 00:31:57,371
I have seen your photo.
But you have not seen me.

421
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:58,998
You have not seen my habits.

422
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:01,292
I don't know if you
will like me or not.

423
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:05,692
Why not? I like you
even without seeing.

424
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:07,461
When should I come to meet you?

425
00:32:07,485 --> 00:32:11,239
Yes? No, no, I will come myself.

426
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,212
Tomorrow evening at 4 o' clock.

427
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:15,332
I have to go to the hospital now.

428
00:32:16,214 --> 00:32:17,507
With whom were you talking?

429
00:32:18,192 --> 00:32:20,212
Sister, it was some
friend of Asha's.

430
00:32:20,358 --> 00:32:22,212
Sister, get ready quickly,
we have to reach..

431
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:24,052
The hospital by 11 o' clock. Come.

432
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,332
Hey, girl. Who are you? Whom
do you want? Ganpat uncle.

433
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,212
- Ganpat uncle.
- Coming. Coming. Coming. Coming.

434
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:58,390
From where do I come? Tell me, sir.

435
00:32:58,528 --> 00:33:00,212
Uncle, someone has come to meet you.

436
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,652
- May be she is your daughter-in-law.
- Daughter-in-law. Sir.

437
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:13,292
Hey girl. Dear, maybe you
have come here by mistake.

438
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:16,292
No. strange.

439
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,372
I don't have a son, then where did
this daughter-in-law come from?

440
00:33:23,512 --> 00:33:24,652
Something is wrong.

441
00:33:27,758 --> 00:33:33,839
Daughter-in-law, this is my
son and this is my master.

442
00:33:34,037 --> 00:33:36,852
And he is not married till now.

443
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:38,379
It will.

444
00:33:39,227 --> 00:33:43,012
It will? Who have you come to meet?

445
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:45,692
- With Suresh.
- Me?

446
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:49,372
What relation do I have
with you? Who are you?

447
00:33:49,452 --> 00:33:53,903
- Look at this forced guest.
- He had called me.

448
00:33:53,983 --> 00:33:57,092
Uncle Ganpat. She is lying.
Why will I call her?

449
00:33:57,881 --> 00:34:00,212
You were about to fetch me yourself.

450
00:34:00,432 --> 00:34:05,058
- I and you? Who are you?
- Asha.

451
00:34:06,425 --> 00:34:07,212
Asha?

452
00:34:07,292 --> 00:34:10,252
I had told you over the phone
that I will come myself.

453
00:34:11,985 --> 00:34:13,451
You are that Asha.

454
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,100
- Uncle Ganpat.
- Understood. Two cups of tea.

455
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,211
- Right. Right.
- I will just bring it.

456
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:22,732
Why are you standing now? Come, sit.

457
00:34:23,643 --> 00:34:25,691
Why are you giving
me so much respect?

458
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:29,819
In India they address the
woman very informally.

459
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:36,412
All right. Do come. I mean,
come. Come. Sit.

460
00:34:37,913 --> 00:34:42,212
Why down? Sit here on the sofa.
Yes, that's like it.

461
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:46,772
- No why is this veil for?
- I am feeling shy.

462
00:34:54,553 --> 00:34:56,662
- I cannot believe that..
- I am Asha.

463
00:34:56,742 --> 00:34:58,092
No, no, it's not like that.

464
00:34:58,366 --> 00:35:00,212
Actually I had guessed
something else..

465
00:35:00,292 --> 00:35:02,252
By hearing your voice
over the phone.

466
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:10,092
Suresh, I came here to tell you
that, we have huge differences.

467
00:35:10,699 --> 00:35:12,892
Asha, differences can be rubbed out.

468
00:35:13,137 --> 00:35:17,212
But how, you are so
educated and I am..

469
00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:19,292
How far have you studied?

470
00:35:21,104 --> 00:35:23,892
I reached the ninth standard
by father's influence.

471
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:26,572
And I failed my tenth
exams ten times.

472
00:35:26,778 --> 00:35:30,012
- Actually, I dint want to keep you in the dark.
- Tea.

473
00:35:30,947 --> 00:35:33,126
Why are you hiding
from Ganpat uncle?

474
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:35,652
- He is an elder.
- Daughter-in-law.

475
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:40,521
Leave alone the veil, girls
nowadays even cut their hair.

476
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:43,669
Yes? I will cut my head,
but I won't cut my hair.

477
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:45,852
That's good.

478
00:35:52,612 --> 00:35:54,572
Daughter-in-law, take this tea.

479
00:36:18,903 --> 00:36:20,052
It is very hot, isn't it?

480
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,215
- Shall I leave?
- Daughter-in-law.

481
00:36:27,379 --> 00:36:28,699
The food is still being prepared.

482
00:36:28,858 --> 00:36:32,212
No, no, my friend must be waiting.
I will come later.

483
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,332
- Come, I will leave you.
- Go, Go. - Come. - Go.

484
00:36:36,988 --> 00:36:39,852
Drop her quickly. What
a daughter-in-law?

485
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,652
What kind of daughters-in-law
are there?

486
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:58,688
Greetings.

487
00:36:58,768 --> 00:36:59,932
Listen.

488
00:37:05,538 --> 00:37:08,167
I have hosted a party for
my friends and relatives.

489
00:37:08,247 --> 00:37:12,452
- Do come a little well dressed.
- I will come.

490
00:37:12,975 --> 00:37:16,652
- But don't tell anyone that I am your wife-to-be.
- Why?

491
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:21,052
I have told you, I have to come to
Mumbai without informing father.

492
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,292
All right, I will tell you, you are
my childhood girl friend. Okay?

493
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:48,540
- Hello, Suneeta.
- Hello, doctor. - All right Uma.

494
00:37:49,206 --> 00:37:50,810
- Thank you, doctor.
- Sister, you can leave.

495
00:37:50,834 --> 00:37:52,212
Come by 7 o' clock in the evening.

496
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,660
What is this, sister? You
have not eaten anything.

497
00:37:59,592 --> 00:38:00,727
Take this.

498
00:38:02,412 --> 00:38:05,412
- It's sweet, right?
- Yes.

499
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:14,452
You have become elder to
me despite being younger.

500
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:19,732
You are taking such pains.
You are serving me so much.

501
00:38:22,678 --> 00:38:24,212
Why do you say like this, sister?

502
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:29,452
Nothing can be happier for me
than the healing of your leg.

503
00:38:33,636 --> 00:38:37,212
- Cheers. - Yeah, good luck.
- Thank you. - Excuse me.

504
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:42,300
- Hi, how do you do? - Fine.
- Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

505
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,732
- Come Verma sir, how are you?
- Just a minute.

506
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,212
- Hello.
- Hi.

507
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:07,692
I had told you to come well dressed.

508
00:39:09,086 --> 00:39:10,932
Didn't I come well dressed?

509
00:39:13,522 --> 00:39:17,212
"My color, my beauty."

510
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:21,292
"My cheeks, my hair."

511
00:39:21,602 --> 00:39:27,406
"My walk, my condition.
Just look at it."

512
00:39:27,486 --> 00:39:29,292
"Look at it."

513
00:39:40,855 --> 00:39:46,702
"Do I look as you have
thought me to be?

514
00:39:49,029 --> 00:39:53,872
"Do I look as you have
thought me to be?

515
00:39:53,952 --> 00:39:59,113
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

516
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:04,812
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

517
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:12,379
"Do I look as you have
thought me to be?

518
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:17,352
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

519
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:23,093
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

520
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:25,452
"How do I look?"

521
00:40:25,532 --> 00:40:31,492
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

522
00:40:54,806 --> 00:40:57,172
"I came to the function."

523
00:40:57,252 --> 00:41:02,452
"At one glance I became the
guest of everyone's heart."

524
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:05,106
"I became a guest."

525
00:41:07,857 --> 00:41:10,172
"I came to the function."

526
00:41:10,252 --> 00:41:15,452
"At one glance I became the
guest of everyone's heart."

527
00:41:15,532 --> 00:41:17,972
"I became a guest."

528
00:41:18,355 --> 00:41:25,772
"When I saw my face in the mirror,
I was amazed at myself."

529
00:41:25,974 --> 00:41:28,412
"I was amazed."

530
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:33,464
"I didn't know this.."

531
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,132
"How do I look?"

532
00:41:36,212 --> 00:41:41,212
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

533
00:41:41,292 --> 00:41:46,801
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

534
00:41:47,277 --> 00:41:49,132
"How do I look?"

535
00:41:49,212 --> 00:41:54,517
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

536
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:56,852
"Tell me."

537
00:42:25,802 --> 00:42:33,212
"My good darling, exert yourself
a little for my sake."

538
00:42:33,292 --> 00:42:36,052
"Exert yourself a little."

539
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:46,132
"My good darling, exert yourself
a little for my sake."

540
00:42:46,212 --> 00:42:48,737
"Exert yourself a little."

541
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:56,279
"If not by your lips, then at least
praise me through your eyes."

542
00:42:56,495 --> 00:42:59,255
"Praise me a little."

543
00:42:59,732 --> 00:43:06,452
"Praise me, if I look the fairies."

544
00:43:06,532 --> 00:43:11,532
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

545
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:16,994
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

546
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,252
"Do I look as you have
thought me to be?

547
00:43:24,332 --> 00:43:29,343
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

548
00:43:29,423 --> 00:43:34,292
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

549
00:43:34,372 --> 00:43:36,812
"How do I look?"

550
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:42,812
"King, tell me the truth.
How do I look?"

551
00:43:49,516 --> 00:43:52,171
- Get down. - Why here?
- I have to tell you something.

552
00:43:53,633 --> 00:43:54,772
What do you have to say?

553
00:43:55,631 --> 00:43:57,052
I had dreamt differently about you.

554
00:43:57,491 --> 00:44:00,146
I thought my wife to-be is the
daughter of a reputed judge.

555
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:02,543
She must have been molded according
to the new society

556
00:44:02,567 --> 00:44:04,332
She must been raised among
the high society.

557
00:44:04,513 --> 00:44:06,353
She will laugh and shake
hands with my friends.

558
00:44:06,536 --> 00:44:09,200
She will go to parties
in my arms. But you?

559
00:44:09,831 --> 00:44:11,572
You are so apprehensive.

560
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:14,363
You are simple Indian girl walking
on the line of shame.

561
00:44:14,674 --> 00:44:16,794
And seeing you I felt that
even today an Indian girl..

562
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:21,351
Thinks shyness to
be her ornaments.

563
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:24,706
This is the pride for
the women kind, Asha.

564
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,614
- I like you completely.
- Drat it. - Why? What happened?

565
00:44:30,874 --> 00:44:34,892
- No, nothing. I was thinking.
- What were you thinking?

566
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,924
I was thinking that
you won't like me.

567
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,364
Some fool won't like this diamond.

568
00:44:41,571 --> 00:44:44,626
No, no, will you drop me home?

569
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,852
Dear Asha, Uma sister is fine.

570
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:49,996
She remembers you every day.

571
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:52,812
Your and Ashok's life must
be getting deeper everyday.

572
00:44:53,283 --> 00:44:54,452
Correct.

573
00:44:54,675 --> 00:44:57,452
Now nothing must be more important
than Ashok for you.

574
00:44:57,972 --> 00:44:59,215
Can anyone be?

575
00:45:00,252 --> 00:45:02,972
But Suresh is also someone,
whom you won't meet..

576
00:45:03,052 --> 00:45:05,373
Even if you search
for him far and wide.

577
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:08,652
I went to meet Suresh
like a complete idiot.

578
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:11,524
But he is such a devotee
of Indian culture..

579
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,572
That he even saw Indian
culture in my nonsense.

580
00:45:14,905 --> 00:45:17,517
And he started to praise
me instead of abusing.

581
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:22,135
I am sending you some
photos of the way..

582
00:45:22,377 --> 00:45:25,332
I am going to adopt for him
to hate me. Yours Suneeta.

583
00:45:25,412 --> 00:45:26,944
Show me, what she has sent?

584
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:31,407
Wow, what a picture.

585
00:45:31,692 --> 00:45:34,346
That was a fake Asha.
I am the real Asha.

586
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:38,972
The one whom you have
seen till yesterday..

587
00:45:39,052 --> 00:45:40,911
Was a innocent, stupid girl.

588
00:45:41,395 --> 00:45:44,491
In fact, I am a modern girl.

589
00:45:44,732 --> 00:45:47,013
But, why did you come to meet
me with changed appearances?

590
00:45:47,673 --> 00:45:55,267
That was to test whether you pass
my test of eligibility or not?

591
00:45:56,893 --> 00:45:59,315
Tell me. What do you think?

592
00:46:01,209 --> 00:46:03,172
Do you still like me?

593
00:46:03,449 --> 00:46:05,972
I like you a lot. We
will get married.

594
00:46:06,190 --> 00:46:10,047
Marriage? So soon?
Without courtship.

595
00:46:11,249 --> 00:46:12,572
Then when?

596
00:46:12,814 --> 00:46:16,167
First you test me. I will test you.

597
00:46:16,247 --> 00:46:20,532
I mean, we will stay together,
eat, drink and have fun..

598
00:46:20,612 --> 00:46:24,221
- This seems nice after marriage.
- Is it? - Yes.

599
00:46:24,455 --> 00:46:27,499
The things which you like quickly
become boring quickly too.

600
00:46:27,983 --> 00:46:32,290
- I won't divorce you at any cost.
- But I can.

601
00:46:32,913 --> 00:46:34,812
If you tell me tomorrow
that you need children.

602
00:46:34,972 --> 00:46:37,584
And if I say that I don't.
I will certainly say so.

603
00:46:37,887 --> 00:46:39,841
A woman's lady's ends
after having children.

604
00:46:40,351 --> 00:46:42,972
If you like your beauty
more than children..

605
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:44,970
Then I won't insist for children.

606
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,781
All right tell me, will
you drink tea or coffee?

607
00:46:48,421 --> 00:46:53,472
Tea? Coffee? At this time? No.
Drink, I mean whisky.

608
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:58,739
- Whisky?
- Yes, and we will have food outside too. Okay?

609
00:46:59,647 --> 00:47:01,152
- Okay.
- Thank you.

610
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:07,128
- Hi.
- Hi.

611
00:47:08,052 --> 00:47:09,359
- Hi.
- Hello.

612
00:47:11,962 --> 00:47:16,727
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi.

613
00:47:20,896 --> 00:47:22,495
Many people know you here.

614
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:25,418
Yes, all my boyfriends.

615
00:47:26,698 --> 00:47:28,572
But you come to Mumbai
only sometimes.

616
00:47:28,852 --> 00:47:30,918
Yes, I come sometimes.

617
00:47:32,372 --> 00:47:33,548
If you have so many
boyfriends here..

618
00:47:33,572 --> 00:47:35,172
Then how many you
will have in Shimla?

619
00:47:35,606 --> 00:47:37,656
I am Miss Shimla there.

620
00:47:40,363 --> 00:47:42,376
Tell me, which whisky
will you drink?

621
00:47:42,456 --> 00:47:43,217
Whisky?

622
00:47:43,297 --> 00:47:46,427
I think it will be better for you
to drink at home instead of here.

623
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,997
If I had to drink, then what
is home and what is the club?

624
00:47:52,308 --> 00:47:55,422
- Waiter, two large pegs.
- No, just one.

625
00:47:55,638 --> 00:47:59,271
Good, rose sherbet for sir.

626
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:02,903
Strange. You don't drink whisky.

627
00:48:03,972 --> 00:48:06,303
If you have drunk then I have drunk.

628
00:48:13,972 --> 00:48:17,812
- Johnny, she winks.
- She seems fast.

629
00:48:18,255 --> 00:48:21,091
- It seems she will agree.
- Truly? - Yes.

630
00:48:30,788 --> 00:48:32,655
Excuse me, I will just come.

631
00:48:37,871 --> 00:48:40,379
- Hello.
- Come, sit. - No, thank you.

632
00:48:40,942 --> 00:48:43,865
- You are Rita's brother, right?
- No, I am Seema's brother.

633
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:45,972
Yes, Seema is my class mate.

634
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:48,700
You are drinking whisky. Very good.

635
00:48:49,332 --> 00:48:51,390
- Hey, what are you doing?
- For me, please.

636
00:48:56,972 --> 00:48:58,516
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

637
00:49:07,813 --> 00:49:10,927
Drink whisky for our
pleasure. Please.

638
00:49:16,732 --> 00:49:20,839
So sorry. Extremely sorry.
Can I take a cigarette?

639
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:24,892
- Why one? Take the entire packet?
- Thank you.

640
00:49:24,972 --> 00:49:26,445
Thank you so much.

641
00:49:30,412 --> 00:49:35,834
- Take. Smoke.
- No. - Strange.

642
00:49:36,526 --> 00:49:39,332
Neither drinks nor smoke
after coming to the club.

643
00:49:40,012 --> 00:49:42,165
You have drunk I have drunk.

644
00:49:49,972 --> 00:49:51,575
What are you planning?

645
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:01,703
All this is not good, Asha.

646
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:08,214
- Asha.
- Asha? Who is Asha?

647
00:50:09,816 --> 00:50:11,026
I am not Asha.

648
00:50:13,016 --> 00:50:18,663
I am very bad. You are very good.

649
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:23,203
- Waiter, one more large drink.
- What are you doing?

650
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:25,045
Sit. Sit here.

651
00:50:26,257 --> 00:50:31,612
You won't understand, darling.
I am drowned.

652
00:50:31,692 --> 00:50:34,974
Don't drink anymore, Asha? Alcohol
is a very bad thing.

653
00:50:54,185 --> 00:51:01,338
"Alcohol is the worst thing."

654
00:51:02,332 --> 00:51:08,239
"I am even worse than alcohol."

655
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:16,772
"Alcohol is the worst thing."

656
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:20,979
"I am even worse than alcohol."

657
00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:29,489
"Why does he like me,
ask the kind sir."

658
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,088
"Alcohol is the worst thing."

659
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:38,567
"I am even worse than alcohol."

660
00:52:03,972 --> 00:52:10,172
"The sir thinks like this about me."

661
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,922
"The sir thinks like this about me."

662
00:52:16,545 --> 00:52:22,037
"I am a blooming flower of rose."

663
00:52:22,313 --> 00:52:30,313
"But thorns are surrounding
the rose in such a way."

664
00:52:31,127 --> 00:52:35,096
"Alcohol is the worst thing."

665
00:52:35,382 --> 00:52:39,178
"I am even worse than alcohol."

666
00:52:39,549 --> 00:52:43,442
"Alcohol is the worst thing."

667
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:47,663
"I am even worse than alcohol."

668
00:53:08,714 --> 00:53:14,852
"The one who loves me is crazy."

669
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:20,511
"The one who loves me is crazy."

670
00:53:21,177 --> 00:53:26,409
"Friends you can never trust me."

671
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:34,850
"How can I tell you, some
of my bad stories?"

672
00:53:35,604 --> 00:53:39,772
"Alcohol is the worst thing."

673
00:53:39,852 --> 00:53:43,892
"I am even worse than alcohol."

674
00:53:43,972 --> 00:53:47,791
"Alcohol is the worst thing."

675
00:53:48,171 --> 00:53:52,141
"I am even worse than alcohol."

676
00:54:24,703 --> 00:54:30,798
"I will be somehow blamed."

677
00:54:30,878 --> 00:54:36,551
"I will be somehow blamed."

678
00:54:37,018 --> 00:54:42,320
"Somewhere I will get some name."

679
00:54:42,606 --> 00:54:50,606
"You can see the story anytime
from some book."

680
00:54:51,324 --> 00:54:55,412
"Alcohol is the worst thing."

681
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:59,090
"I am even worse than alcohol."

682
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:07,540
"Ask the sir, why he likes me."

683
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:11,812
"Alcohol is the worst thing."

684
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:15,972
"I am even worse than alcohol."

685
00:56:11,012 --> 00:56:14,807
- Madam. - Yes.
- Sir is calling you outside. - Sir? - Yes.

686
00:56:14,887 --> 00:56:15,887
Okay.

687
00:56:48,825 --> 00:56:50,298
I am telling, go from here.

688
00:56:52,103 --> 00:56:53,543
I am telling you,
don't come forward.

689
00:56:54,092 --> 00:56:55,252
Don't come forward.

690
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:00,452
No. No. Leave me.

691
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:05,178
Leave me. Leave me.

692
00:57:10,151 --> 00:57:11,301
No.

693
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,052
Where are you going, darling?

694
00:57:24,372 --> 00:57:28,327
I like you but take me away
from all of them. Truly?

695
00:57:28,407 --> 00:57:29,572
True.

696
00:57:52,725 --> 00:57:53,852
The girl.

697
00:58:25,104 --> 00:58:26,185
Hold her.

698
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:26,020
Come.

699
00:59:27,133 --> 00:59:28,355
What are you doing, Suneeta?

700
00:59:29,436 --> 00:59:31,412
Nothing sister. I am writing
a letter to Asha.

701
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:34,012
- May I ask you one thing?
- Ask me.

702
00:59:35,198 --> 00:59:38,332
You seem lost these
days. What is it?

703
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,972
- Nothing at all, sister.
- How are you, Uma? - I am fine, doctor.

704
00:59:43,172 --> 00:59:47,197
Suneeta, last night you
have gone to Ruby club?

705
00:59:47,976 --> 00:59:52,172
Me? A girl just like you was
there with a young man.

706
00:59:53,295 --> 00:59:54,615
It might be someone else, doctor.

707
00:59:55,825 --> 00:59:59,052
Yes, she was a very
flirty kind of girl.

708
01:00:00,506 --> 01:00:03,292
- Suneeta. You..
- I will go and post the letter, sister.

709
01:00:16,226 --> 01:00:19,572
I am the one who hides
the pain in her heart..

710
01:00:20,896 --> 01:00:23,452
And goes on doing the
chores of the world.

711
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:32,372
- Why? You were waiting for someone else?
- No, come.

712
01:00:33,804 --> 01:00:38,561
- Not come, let's go.
- Where? -Where I will take you.

713
01:00:39,729 --> 01:00:44,031
- But yesterday, you were..
- Yesterday was someone else's madam.

714
01:00:45,177 --> 01:00:50,212
- Today is mine. Come.
- I am coming. Sit. - Okay.

715
01:00:57,399 --> 01:00:59,885
I don't want to keep you
in the dark anymore Asha.

716
01:01:04,116 --> 01:01:07,372
Till now, even I had hid
myself in Indian culture.

717
01:01:07,845 --> 01:01:09,763
I have been raised in
the Western culture.

718
01:01:10,574 --> 01:01:12,086
This is my reality.

719
01:01:13,574 --> 01:01:17,212
Brandy or whisky? How about both?

720
01:01:21,318 --> 01:01:24,684
- Cheers.
- But, you..

721
01:01:25,967 --> 01:01:30,092
I am crazy about girls and
alcohol from the beginning.

722
01:01:33,102 --> 01:01:35,032
What are you doing?

723
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:38,212
I have not done anything till now.

724
01:01:39,588 --> 01:01:42,572
Actually I like going to clubs.

725
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:46,652
But I have a reason to
bring you here. What?

726
01:01:46,858 --> 01:01:50,652
My grandpa got married and
he brought my granny here.

727
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:54,589
My daddy got married and
he brought my mummy here.

728
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:56,972
And today I have brought
you here to carry..

729
01:01:57,052 --> 01:01:59,252
Forward the custom
of my forefathers.

730
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:01,212
But I am not married.

731
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:04,616
The marriage will take
place, my queen.

732
01:02:05,332 --> 01:02:08,972
- Look, you have tested me. Tested me.
- Yes.

733
01:02:09,052 --> 01:02:13,414
I have tested you. And we will
spend the entire night here.

734
01:02:13,778 --> 01:02:17,075
- We eat, drink and have fun.
- No, no.

735
01:02:19,494 --> 01:02:24,183
Today I will drink so much
that everything will dance.

736
01:02:24,616 --> 01:02:29,572
Today no one will be ignored. Drink
- No.

737
01:02:29,652 --> 01:02:33,572
- Where are you going? Drink.
- No.

738
01:02:33,652 --> 01:02:35,022
- You won't drink.
- No.

739
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:40,036
- Come into my arms.
- No. - Come. - No, no.

740
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:43,928
No, no. Why?

741
01:02:44,604 --> 01:02:46,852
This weather is beautiful.

742
01:02:47,253 --> 01:02:49,212
This moment is beautiful.

743
01:02:49,821 --> 01:02:55,492
- And on top of that you are beautiful.
- No.

744
01:02:58,497 --> 01:03:01,812
- No.
- Why are you scared? Here. Enough.

745
01:03:02,199 --> 01:03:04,652
You are shy of me?

746
01:03:06,768 --> 01:03:08,972
That day you were dancing
and singing..

747
01:03:09,052 --> 01:03:11,412
In front of everyone in the club.

748
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:17,652
- "Alcohol is the worst thing."
- No.

749
01:03:17,732 --> 01:03:21,335
"I am worse even than alcohol."

750
01:03:21,732 --> 01:03:25,862
"Then why does he like me?"

751
01:03:26,132 --> 01:03:28,848
- I will tell you today, why I like you?
- No.

752
01:04:06,834 --> 01:04:11,726
"If it is not the sea,
then what is it?"

753
01:04:12,469 --> 01:04:16,929
"If it is not the sea,
then what is it?"

754
01:04:17,577 --> 01:04:23,022
"It is the intoxication
of your eyes."

755
01:04:23,563 --> 01:04:29,009
"If they are not clouds,
then what are they?"

756
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:33,334
"If they are not clouds,
then what are they?"

757
01:04:34,293 --> 01:04:39,982
"It is the tresses of your hair."

758
01:04:40,372 --> 01:04:45,765
"If it is not the sea,
then what is it?"

759
01:05:02,806 --> 01:05:10,806
"In the function of my desires
you are going away."

760
01:05:14,157 --> 01:05:18,972
"Why are you so angry with me?"

761
01:05:19,196 --> 01:05:24,750
"That you are looking away from me?"

762
01:05:25,168 --> 01:05:28,332
"That you are looking away from me?"

763
01:05:28,412 --> 01:05:32,969
"If it is not the weather,
then what it is?"

764
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:39,294
"It is the opportunity
to make love."

765
01:05:39,591 --> 01:05:45,132
"If it is not the sea,
then what is it?"

766
01:06:10,955 --> 01:06:15,972
"I will spend a few
moments with you..

767
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:21,117
In the shade of your thick hair."

768
01:06:21,969 --> 01:06:26,692
"We drink everyday from the sea."

769
01:06:26,772 --> 01:06:32,332
"Today I will drink from your eyes."

770
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:36,009
"I will drink from your eyes."

771
01:06:36,089 --> 01:06:40,767
"If it is not alcohol
then what it is."

772
01:06:41,321 --> 01:06:46,822
"She is a delicate darling."

773
01:06:47,308 --> 01:06:52,402
"If it is not the sea,
then what is it?"

774
01:07:12,068 --> 01:07:20,068
"I feel like regarding it
the night of Armageddon."

775
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:27,972
"I swear on you I feel like
giving you my life..

776
01:07:28,052 --> 01:07:33,555
And not only my heart."

777
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:37,292
"I feel like it."

778
01:07:37,372 --> 01:07:41,675
"If it not a killer
then what it is."

779
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:48,122
"It is your amazing attitude."

780
01:07:48,513 --> 01:07:54,189
"If it is not the sea,
then what is it?"

781
01:08:00,649 --> 01:08:06,838
"If it is not the sea,
then what is it?"

782
01:08:09,446 --> 01:08:11,652
I beg of you, let me go.

783
01:08:11,918 --> 01:08:14,212
I am not the one whom
you think me to be.

784
01:08:17,837 --> 01:08:19,945
I am also not the one whom
you think me to be.

785
01:08:20,732 --> 01:08:22,202
I am also not intoxicated.

786
01:08:22,692 --> 01:08:26,161
That was not alcohol.
It was just sherbet.

787
01:08:31,337 --> 01:08:32,972
Then why did you enact this drama?

788
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:35,188
That is what I want
to ask you, that..

789
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:37,052
Why did you enact
that drama that day?

790
01:08:37,959 --> 01:08:40,972
Do you think me to be such
a fool that I won't know..

791
01:08:41,051 --> 01:08:43,971
That judge's daughter
cannot be as innocent..

792
01:08:44,051 --> 01:08:46,013
As you have acted to be.

793
01:08:46,094 --> 01:08:48,027
And a girl from a good family
cannot be so lowly..

794
01:08:48,051 --> 01:08:50,491
As you have acted to be.

795
01:08:50,973 --> 01:08:54,960
Well, I like both
you and your drama.

796
01:08:56,446 --> 01:08:59,492
Hey, you like me too right?

797
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:03,212
My destiny is not so good.

798
01:09:03,865 --> 01:09:07,212
You have the destiny. Today a
very good thing has occurred.

799
01:09:07,487 --> 01:09:11,312
- What?
- I have to go to Kolkata for a week.

800
01:09:11,907 --> 01:09:15,732
I would have been very tense if
this drama had not ended today.

801
01:09:15,812 --> 01:09:17,052
Believe me.

802
01:09:18,258 --> 01:09:21,137
Now I will pass my seven
days quickly..

803
01:09:21,216 --> 01:09:24,081
Remembering you and my acting.

804
01:09:30,171 --> 01:09:33,135
'Dear Asha, all my endeavors
to give birth to hatred..

805
01:09:33,216 --> 01:09:36,052
In Suresh's mind
has proved futile.'

806
01:09:36,372 --> 01:09:39,052
'He has started to love
me a lot as Asha.'

807
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:43,571
'Such time has come, that I don't
want to cheat him further.'

808
01:09:44,051 --> 01:09:45,291
'He has gone to Kolkata.'

809
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:48,732
'As soon as he returns I
will tell him clearly..

810
01:09:49,212 --> 01:09:51,311
That I am not Asha but Suneeta.'

811
01:09:51,904 --> 01:09:57,121
'I don't know what the outcome
will be. Always yours Suneeta.'

812
01:10:02,052 --> 01:10:05,013
Hello. Ganpat uncle speaking.

813
01:10:05,634 --> 01:10:08,539
Daughter-in-law, greetings.

814
01:10:09,372 --> 01:10:13,350
Yes, Suresh sir has returned
from Kolkata last night.

815
01:10:13,572 --> 01:10:14,892
And is sleeping now.

816
01:10:14,972 --> 01:10:19,292
Is it? And yes, even his parents
have returned from London today.

817
01:10:21,444 --> 01:10:23,348
His parents have come too!

818
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:26,375
Now I should tell him everything.

819
01:10:26,794 --> 01:10:28,293
What daughter-in-law?

820
01:10:28,645 --> 01:10:30,401
Nothing. Nothing.

821
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:40,982
- Greetings.
- Greetings. Suneeta, how is your sister?

822
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:44,172
She is fine. She will be released
form the hospital soon.

823
01:10:44,806 --> 01:10:46,887
But how did you come suddenly?

824
01:10:47,185 --> 01:10:50,052
The father of our son-in-law to-be
had arrived from London.

825
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:52,212
And we have to talk
something with him.

826
01:10:52,617 --> 01:10:55,846
Asha, go and get ready quickly.
I will call them.

827
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:09,172
- Tell me, how is your Ashok?
- Don't take that dog's name.

828
01:11:10,901 --> 01:11:12,534
What is the matter, Asha?

829
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:16,752
It seems you have been deeply hurt.

830
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,333
I escaped, Suneeta.

831
01:11:20,171 --> 01:11:22,028
Otherwise I don't know what
would have happened to me.

832
01:11:22,052 --> 01:11:23,493
After all what is the matter?

833
01:11:23,805 --> 01:11:27,534
The day I got your letter,
the next day morning..

834
01:11:28,129 --> 01:11:30,452
I was about to go to Delhi
with daddy for a week.

835
01:11:31,656 --> 01:11:34,683
But suddenly daddy's program
to go to Delhi got canceled.

836
01:11:35,507 --> 01:11:39,777
And I reached Ashok's bungalow
to meet him that very evening.

837
01:11:52,776 --> 01:11:54,052
Tell me.

838
01:11:56,046 --> 01:11:57,212
You?

839
01:12:03,088 --> 01:12:05,212
Why are you shocked to see me?

840
01:12:06,547 --> 01:12:07,652
Why will I get shocked?

841
01:12:08,439 --> 01:12:11,052
Maybe because how I
came here from Delhi.

842
01:12:12,412 --> 01:12:14,601
A lot of people come
from Delhi. Sit.

843
01:12:14,926 --> 01:12:16,692
Why did you give me a wrong address?

844
01:12:17,212 --> 01:12:19,092
Why did you promise me falsely
to write letters?

845
01:12:20,155 --> 01:12:22,212
False promise? To whom?

846
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:27,832
All right, so now I have to even
tell you that my name is Geeta.

847
01:12:28,481 --> 01:12:31,052
We met at an exhibition at Delhi.

848
01:12:31,913 --> 01:12:34,052
Those meetings had turned to love.

849
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:37,752
And where we have
journeyed together?

850
01:12:40,076 --> 01:12:45,089
A journey is a journey madam.
You meet many people there.

851
01:12:46,724 --> 01:12:48,132
We get to know them.

852
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:54,292
And when the journey ends,
the recognition ends too.

853
01:12:54,495 --> 01:12:56,652
No, Ashok, no. Don't say like that.

854
01:12:57,278 --> 01:13:00,052
You had promised to with me
in the journey of life.

855
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:05,158
I had given you everything that
belonged to me by trusting you.

856
01:13:09,861 --> 01:13:11,812
You have committed a big mistake.

857
01:13:13,793 --> 01:13:16,928
No, Ashok, don't say like that.

858
01:13:17,307 --> 01:13:20,452
After much problem I have
found you and reached here.

859
01:13:20,848 --> 01:13:27,862
I have brought you the
souvenir of our love.

860
01:13:29,186 --> 01:13:36,321
- Souvenir of love?
- Yes, yes. I am pregnant with your child.

861
01:13:38,065 --> 01:13:40,780
Pregnant with my child.
You are trying to lump..

862
01:13:40,860 --> 01:13:43,732
Someone else's sin on my head.

863
01:13:44,807 --> 01:13:48,590
Ashok, you have only seen
one form of woman.

864
01:13:50,172 --> 01:13:54,414
Let me stay in that form. I
am pregnant with your child.

865
01:13:54,819 --> 01:13:59,412
Give me and my child to
live in this society.

866
01:13:59,967 --> 01:14:02,812
Ashok, marry me and
fulfill your promise.

867
01:14:02,892 --> 01:14:05,052
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

868
01:14:05,522 --> 01:14:07,482
I don't know how many girls
I will have to marry..

869
01:14:07,941 --> 01:14:10,454
- If I go on fulfilling promises like this.
- No.

870
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:14,469
- And you know the law of our country. Do one thing.
- No.

871
01:14:14,915 --> 01:14:18,618
Forget me and marry some good boy.

872
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:22,577
I am marrying the daughter of
a very big judge of this city.

873
01:14:23,077 --> 01:14:24,631
Forget that girl.

874
01:14:29,266 --> 01:14:31,482
All right, so this is the
other victim trapped..

875
01:14:31,562 --> 01:14:33,372
In your web of false love?

876
01:14:33,452 --> 01:14:34,652
Would you please shut up?

877
01:14:34,732 --> 01:14:38,144
No, Ashok, you cannot play with
life of some other girl.

878
01:14:38,536 --> 01:14:41,052
Asha, this wicked girl is
condemning me falsely.

879
01:14:41,132 --> 01:14:42,252
Be ashamed, Ashok.

880
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:46,052
Today I have witnessed your
ugly form. I was late.

881
01:14:46,494 --> 01:14:49,692
I didn't know you are a devil
in the guise of man.

882
01:14:50,603 --> 01:14:53,972
One day I was about to run with
you leaving everything.

883
01:14:54,198 --> 01:14:55,211
Asha.

884
01:14:55,779 --> 01:14:57,972
But it is good, that
our trip to Delhi..

885
01:14:58,052 --> 01:15:00,452
Was suddenly canceled
today and I came here.

886
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:02,941
I don't want to see your
face ever in my life.

887
01:15:03,021 --> 01:15:05,812
Asha. Asha, listen. Wait.

888
01:15:09,996 --> 01:15:11,372
Scared?

889
01:15:13,252 --> 01:15:17,292
The right for you to go
from here is in my hands.

890
01:15:17,604 --> 01:15:20,652
- Not in your hands. Come with me.
- Leave me.

891
01:15:20,732 --> 01:15:23,132
- Come. - I am telling you leave me.
- Come with me.

892
01:15:26,525 --> 01:15:27,903
- Leave her.
- Silence.

893
01:15:27,983 --> 01:15:29,292
I am telling you, leave me.

894
01:15:29,372 --> 01:15:31,092
You don't want to
see my face, right?

895
01:15:31,172 --> 01:15:32,772
You don't even want to see my face.

896
01:15:45,752 --> 01:15:49,052
Go from here. God has saved
you from being ruined today.

897
01:15:49,132 --> 01:15:53,412
- Go. - And you?
- I am already dead. Don't worry about me.

898
01:15:53,492 --> 01:15:56,492
Go. Go. Go.

899
01:15:59,838 --> 01:16:02,052
Ashok became the victim
of that girl's bullet.

900
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,972
That sinner's life was death to me.

901
01:16:05,772 --> 01:16:08,172
And now his death had also
become death for me.

902
01:16:09,338 --> 01:16:12,946
I am neither there nor her, Suneeta.

903
01:16:15,352 --> 01:16:18,172
Don't worry. Nothing has
been spoilt till now.

904
01:16:18,568 --> 01:16:20,092
What is there to be spoiled?

905
01:16:21,435 --> 01:16:23,532
You have written in your last
letter that instead..

906
01:16:23,759 --> 01:16:26,332
Of hating you, Suresh
has started loving you.

907
01:16:26,710 --> 01:16:30,652
Yes, but not with me but with Asha.

908
01:16:31,164 --> 01:16:33,985
Not with Asha. Only
with the name Asha.

909
01:16:34,612 --> 01:16:37,574
When daddy will introduce
me to Suresh as Asha then..

910
01:16:37,654 --> 01:16:41,092
It will be good. Suresh
will start hating me.

911
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:47,348
I will become a lowly girl
and a cheat in his regards.

912
01:16:47,921 --> 01:16:54,408
- No, no, Suneeta. I won't let you get defamed.
- Asha.

913
01:16:57,208 --> 01:16:58,292
Asha.

914
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:04,052
You are still not ready? I am ready.

915
01:17:04,234 --> 01:17:05,652
They might be waiting for us.

916
01:17:05,975 --> 01:17:08,052
Suneeta, you also come with us.

917
01:17:08,212 --> 01:17:10,623
Come and see what a good boy
I have searched for Asha.

918
01:17:10,703 --> 01:17:13,597
Uncle, I will see him latter.
Sister might be waiting for me.

919
01:17:13,677 --> 01:17:16,332
All right. Asha, get ready quickly.

920
01:17:31,574 --> 01:17:34,972
- Coming. - Is sir at home?
- He is. - Come, daughter.

921
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:37,045
Come carefully.

922
01:17:43,972 --> 01:17:45,109
Hands up.

923
01:17:47,325 --> 01:17:50,812
You are trapped after
a long time Mahinder.

924
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:54,572
If I was not trapped, how would
you become my relative?

925
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:56,137
Come, hug me.

926
01:17:56,374 --> 01:17:59,823
- Greetings brother.
- Greetings. Greetings, sister-in-law.

927
01:17:59,903 --> 01:18:02,212
Amazing. Sister-in-law you
have not changed at all.

928
01:18:05,052 --> 01:18:06,532
Didn't you recognize me, dear?

929
01:18:07,092 --> 01:18:08,652
You used to come into my lap.

930
01:18:09,186 --> 01:18:10,692
Today she doesn't come into my arms.

931
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,413
- She has grown up.
- Son Suresh. Look who has come?

932
01:18:19,142 --> 01:18:22,292
This is my childhood friend,
Judge Mahinder Nath.

933
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:24,812
- Greetings uncle.
- Live long, dear. Live long.

934
01:18:25,052 --> 01:18:26,572
And this is our Asha.

935
01:18:33,444 --> 01:18:34,995
Asha?

936
01:18:38,772 --> 01:18:42,612
- But that girl in your flat.
- She is Suneeta. Asha's friend.

937
01:18:42,692 --> 01:18:44,612
She has come here to have
her sister treated.

938
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:48,212
- Please, excuse me.
- Come Mahinder.

939
01:18:51,619 --> 01:18:53,652
- Mother has sent no letters.
- Suneeta.

940
01:18:57,642 --> 01:18:59,172
Suneeta, I want to talk to you.

941
01:19:00,367 --> 01:19:03,732
Sister, I will just come. Come.

942
01:19:09,663 --> 01:19:14,252
- Do you remember this place?
- I can never forget this place.

943
01:19:15,870 --> 01:19:17,692
That beautiful moment, weather..

944
01:19:18,389 --> 01:19:24,973
- And the storm of love in your heart.
- Silence.

945
01:19:25,275 --> 01:19:27,532
Your cheating and deceit
has been revealed.

946
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:30,332
Why did you become Asha? Why
did you play with my life?

947
01:19:31,977 --> 01:19:35,545
- To make my life.
- By snatching your friend's right.

948
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:39,692
- By cheating her.
- Yes. - Why? For what?

949
01:19:40,215 --> 01:19:43,452
God has given her everything.
He has given her wealth.

950
01:19:43,955 --> 01:19:45,134
He has given her honor.

951
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:49,437
And her crime is that handsome
and rich youth like you..

952
01:19:50,085 --> 01:19:51,572
I couldn't tolerate this.

953
01:19:51,692 --> 01:19:54,702
Because of this jealousy
I acted to be Asha.

954
01:19:55,804 --> 01:19:59,092
You are so lowly.
You are so envious.

955
01:20:00,669 --> 01:20:02,572
This is not a new thing, Suresh.

956
01:20:02,918 --> 01:20:05,052
The poor is always envious
of the rich.

957
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:07,972
I was jealous of my
friend's destiny.

958
01:20:09,091 --> 01:20:10,692
I tried to get you.

959
01:20:10,994 --> 01:20:13,411
To get your property
I had done all this drama.

960
01:20:13,632 --> 01:20:15,172
Shameless. Unashamed.

961
01:20:15,746 --> 01:20:17,768
You have cheated me
and Asha in so much.

962
01:20:17,848 --> 01:20:19,492
I don't even want to see your face.

963
01:20:24,687 --> 01:20:27,172
Who was he? Where did
you go with him?

964
01:20:27,843 --> 01:20:29,616
I am asking something.

965
01:20:30,557 --> 01:20:32,972
Sister. Sister, don't
ask me anything.

966
01:20:33,498 --> 01:20:35,052
I cannot say anything.

967
01:20:36,146 --> 01:20:39,772
So the doctor's suspicion
was not a suspicion.

968
01:20:41,065 --> 01:20:43,572
This was the boy with whom he
had seen you in the club.

969
01:20:44,452 --> 01:20:48,652
- Suneeta, I need an answer.
- Yes, sister. He was that boy.

970
01:20:49,313 --> 01:20:54,243
But sister, whatever the doctor
saw was not at all true.

971
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,052
All that was a drama.

972
01:20:56,132 --> 01:20:59,054
Only drama which I had
enacted for Asha.

973
01:20:59,314 --> 01:21:00,532
For Asha?

974
01:21:00,968 --> 01:21:05,242
Yes, sister. Asha's daddy
had chosen Suresh for Asha.

975
01:21:06,157 --> 01:21:10,081
And Asha had decided to
become someone else's.

976
01:21:11,054 --> 01:21:15,652
That's why Asha made this plan
for Suresh to hate her.

977
01:21:16,838 --> 01:21:21,466
That I should meet Suresh
as Asha and act this way.

978
01:21:21,909 --> 01:21:24,652
And Asha gave you 5,000
rupees for this drama.

979
01:21:25,217 --> 01:21:28,052
And you sold your limits
to have me treated.

980
01:21:30,203 --> 01:21:32,732
- I wish I had died as an invalid.
- No, sister.

981
01:21:32,971 --> 01:21:34,212
This is not the case.

982
01:21:34,917 --> 01:21:36,372
I have understood everything Munni.

983
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:38,572
I have understood everything.

984
01:21:39,621 --> 01:21:45,172
You are pounded between Asha's
favor and Suresh's love.

985
01:21:46,862 --> 01:21:48,915
You had gone to cheat Suresh.

986
01:21:49,899 --> 01:21:51,332
You are yourself cheated.

987
01:21:53,612 --> 01:21:55,572
Now when Suresh will
know the truth..

988
01:21:56,255 --> 01:21:58,855
And what will happen when the
judge will know about this drama?

989
01:21:59,163 --> 01:22:03,044
No, no, I will tell
Suresh everything.

990
01:22:03,271 --> 01:22:06,731
I will tell him, why and for
whom you enacted this drama.

991
01:22:06,811 --> 01:22:09,372
- Understand?
- Sister, don't get up. - No.

992
01:22:11,067 --> 01:22:16,049
I pray, if you love
me even a little..

993
01:22:16,602 --> 01:22:19,575
Then never open your mouth
in front of anyone.

994
01:22:20,234 --> 01:22:23,572
Not even in front of Asha. You
are under my oath, sister.

995
01:22:25,477 --> 01:22:29,563
We will leave for Shimla
today itself.

996
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,858
Greetings sister. Where is Suneeta?

997
01:22:39,572 --> 01:22:41,332
Suneeta, strange.

998
01:22:41,620 --> 01:22:43,620
You came straight to the station
from the hospital.

999
01:22:43,653 --> 01:22:45,172
The train was due, Asha.

1000
01:22:45,687 --> 01:22:48,772
I know everything, you don't want
to go in front of Suresh.

1001
01:22:51,212 --> 01:22:52,572
What is the need for that now?

1002
01:22:52,779 --> 01:22:55,852
Suneeta, you have tolerated so
much insult for my happiness.

1003
01:22:56,671 --> 01:23:01,060
Would you have got Suresh's love,
if I had not tolerated insult?

1004
01:23:01,903 --> 01:23:03,252
Shall I tell you one thing, Asha?

1005
01:23:04,876 --> 01:23:08,098
Suresh is a very good boy.
He is a very loving boy.

1006
01:23:08,909 --> 01:23:12,852
Take care of his heart, okay?

1007
01:23:13,052 --> 01:23:15,708
Suneeta, are you in love with him?

1008
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:20,412
Crazy girl! Can anyone create
hatred by loving?

1009
01:23:22,368 --> 01:23:24,972
My wish is that your
and Suresh's love..

1010
01:23:25,052 --> 01:23:27,572
Should bloom like the spring.

1011
01:23:44,392 --> 01:23:48,372
This is such a beautiful place,
green tress kissing the sky.

1012
01:23:49,117 --> 01:23:52,565
These mountains which are doing
penance like our ancient sages.

1013
01:23:53,138 --> 01:23:55,972
These views soothe the mind so much.

1014
01:23:56,663 --> 01:24:00,412
The mind gets so much peace by
coming here from the crowd.

1015
01:24:01,692 --> 01:24:03,852
The one whose world is ruined
and the one whose heart..

1016
01:24:03,908 --> 01:24:06,470
Is engulfed in the
sea of restlessness,

1017
01:24:07,573 --> 01:24:09,852
he will be suffocated
in this silence.

1018
01:24:10,296 --> 01:24:11,852
What are you saying?

1019
01:24:12,815 --> 01:24:16,092
Just like that. I just changed
the topic from one to another.

1020
01:24:19,712 --> 01:24:20,852
Come, let's go there.

1021
01:24:25,772 --> 01:24:27,972
Look, what a beautiful sari?

1022
01:24:29,372 --> 01:24:30,612
If you like it, then take it.

1023
01:24:30,692 --> 01:24:32,172
No, no, I was just saying it.

1024
01:24:32,252 --> 01:24:34,972
- I am saying so. Pack this sari.
- No, no, no. I..

1025
01:24:35,052 --> 01:24:36,692
A gift from me. Okay.

1026
01:24:36,772 --> 01:24:39,652
- Pack this sari and show me a nice shawl.
- Yes, sir.

1027
01:24:40,664 --> 01:24:42,732
Leave it. Let's go home now.

1028
01:24:42,812 --> 01:24:46,178
Wow, shouldn't I see what
I came for? Whom?

1029
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:50,372
I told you I had to buy a shawl
for mummy. Come, let's see.

1030
01:24:59,294 --> 01:25:00,452
Is it beautiful?

1031
01:25:05,228 --> 01:25:09,484
- It is beautiful. Take it.
- Pack this.

1032
01:25:18,807 --> 01:25:21,972
- Come Asha.
- Buy the shawl. It is very beautiful.

1033
01:25:22,172 --> 01:25:27,132
- You like it too.
- It seems to be good but it fake.

1034
01:25:27,712 --> 01:25:30,572
Sorry, you don't have the right to
say like that without testing it.

1035
01:25:30,652 --> 01:25:32,452
I have tested it. Come, Asha.

1036
01:25:35,821 --> 01:25:38,812
Suneeta, the judge has come.

1037
01:25:38,892 --> 01:25:40,292
- Greetings, sister.
- Greetings.

1038
01:25:40,943 --> 01:25:44,200
We are lucky that you have
come to our house. Come.

1039
01:25:48,430 --> 01:25:51,212
- Sit.
- Greetings uncle. - Live long.

1040
01:25:52,064 --> 01:25:54,335
- Asha have come to invite you before me.
- Yes.

1041
01:25:54,903 --> 01:25:56,972
Sister, you all will have
to come tomorrow evening..

1042
01:25:57,052 --> 01:25:59,158
To the engagement party.

1043
01:25:59,772 --> 01:26:02,772
- Suneeta, you have to come with everyone.
- Yes.

1044
01:26:02,852 --> 01:26:05,612
- Not yes, you have to come.
- Why won't we come?

1045
01:26:05,929 --> 01:26:08,108
- We will surely come.
- All right sister, give me leave now.

1046
01:26:08,132 --> 01:26:10,372
- At least have some tea.
- No, I had loots of tea today.

1047
01:26:10,757 --> 01:26:12,332
Dear, are you coming home?

1048
01:26:12,412 --> 01:26:14,650
- Suresh was asking for you.
- Let's go, daddy.

1049
01:26:15,893 --> 01:26:17,623
All right, greetings.

1050
01:26:23,372 --> 01:26:27,172
- Mother, you and sister will go.
- Are you mad?

1051
01:26:28,285 --> 01:26:30,012
The judge came home because of you.

1052
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:31,692
It is your friend's engagement.

1053
01:26:32,372 --> 01:26:34,092
If you don't go, we won't go either.

1054
01:26:34,649 --> 01:26:37,372
All right mother. Let
tomorrow come first.

1055
01:26:43,244 --> 01:26:45,892
You have come. And have
you come alone?

1056
01:26:45,972 --> 01:26:47,052
No, everyone has come.

1057
01:26:47,132 --> 01:26:49,001
Mother and Uma sister is
downstairs with uncle.

1058
01:26:49,974 --> 01:26:55,663
- Why were you so late?
- I was not well still I came.

1059
01:26:55,879 --> 01:26:58,119
The entire program would have
spoilt if you had not come.

1060
01:26:58,351 --> 01:27:00,612
I have told everyone that you
are going to sing today.

1061
01:27:00,838 --> 01:27:02,486
No, no, I can't sing.

1062
01:27:02,811 --> 01:27:05,052
Not you, even your angels
will also sing.

1063
01:27:05,716 --> 01:27:08,851
Who will sing besides
you for my happiness?

1064
01:27:16,069 --> 01:27:17,252
These are the saris.

1065
01:27:17,372 --> 01:27:20,412
Wear any sari among these
and get ready, quickly.

1066
01:27:20,492 --> 01:27:22,852
- Why?
- Is this the sari you have worn?

1067
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:26,252
- Why, what is lacking in it?
- There is no need to argue.

1068
01:27:26,852 --> 01:27:28,492
No, Asha, leave it. This is okay.

1069
01:27:28,572 --> 01:27:31,312
You will be beaten if you say no.
Come, get ready quickly.

1070
01:27:43,704 --> 01:27:46,704
- Hello judge.
- Welcome, welcome, professor.

1071
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:48,974
Meet my to-be relative
Mr. Chandra Mohan.

1072
01:27:49,054 --> 01:27:50,406
Greetings. I am glad to meet you.

1073
01:27:50,486 --> 01:27:52,464
Professor, do come inside.

1074
01:27:53,758 --> 01:27:57,098
- Hello, how do you do?
- I am okay. Please come inside.

1075
01:27:58,077 --> 01:27:59,598
Excuse me.

1076
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:09,073
Listen, let me see how you look
in the sari I have chosen.

1077
01:28:11,118 --> 01:28:13,989
You? Why did you wear this sari?

1078
01:28:14,648 --> 01:28:17,184
You have still not finished
your drama to be Asha?

1079
01:28:19,091 --> 01:28:22,104
Aren't you ashamed to enact
this drama again and again?

1080
01:28:23,245 --> 01:28:25,593
I have buried you and your drama.

1081
01:28:26,032 --> 01:28:28,824
Shame on you and your lowly drama.

1082
01:28:32,536 --> 01:28:36,151
- Hello, Uma.
- Congrats. - Thank you.

1083
01:29:34,919 --> 01:29:39,514
"Life is a drama."

1084
01:29:39,767 --> 01:29:44,091
"We work in this drama."

1085
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:48,533
"Life is a drama."

1086
01:29:48,854 --> 01:29:53,263
"We work in this drama."

1087
01:29:53,343 --> 01:30:01,343
"We salute everyone as soon as
the curtain rises and falls."

1088
01:30:02,739 --> 01:30:06,675
"We work in this drama."

1089
01:30:07,013 --> 01:30:11,321
"Life is a drama."

1090
01:30:11,980 --> 01:30:15,966
"We work in this drama."

1091
01:30:16,046 --> 01:30:24,046
"We salute everyone as soon as
the curtain rises and falls."

1092
01:30:25,391 --> 01:30:29,497
"We work in this drama."

1093
01:30:29,818 --> 01:30:33,839
"Life is a drama."

1094
01:30:34,104 --> 01:30:38,907
"We work in this drama."

1095
01:31:07,065 --> 01:31:11,322
"In this play sometimes
there are claps."

1096
01:31:11,402 --> 01:31:15,781
"And sometimes people abuses us."

1097
01:31:15,861 --> 01:31:20,344
"In this play sometimes
there are claps."

1098
01:31:20,424 --> 01:31:25,472
"And sometimes people abuses us."

1099
01:31:26,439 --> 01:31:30,865
"We become good, we become bad.'

1100
01:31:31,237 --> 01:31:35,528
"We defame our name."

1101
01:31:35,764 --> 01:31:39,650
"We work in this drama."

1102
01:31:39,954 --> 01:31:44,362
"Life is a drama."

1103
01:31:44,442 --> 01:31:48,619
"We work in this drama."

1104
01:31:49,177 --> 01:31:57,177
"We salute everyone as soon as
the curtain rises and falls."

1105
01:31:57,741 --> 01:32:01,947
"We work in this drama."

1106
01:32:02,200 --> 01:32:06,406
"Life is a drama."

1107
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:11,508
"We work in this drama."

1108
01:32:36,930 --> 01:32:41,424
"Don't ask me what the truth is."

1109
01:32:41,504 --> 01:32:45,564
"Because we are just imposters."

1110
01:32:45,644 --> 01:32:50,092
"Don't ask me what the truth is."

1111
01:32:50,172 --> 01:32:56,122
"Because we are just imposters."

1112
01:32:56,202 --> 01:33:04,202
"We arrange things so that no one
knows or recognizes anything."

1113
01:33:05,344 --> 01:33:09,331
"We work in this drama."

1114
01:33:09,602 --> 01:33:13,689
"Life is a drama."

1115
01:33:14,094 --> 01:33:18,148
"We work in this drama."

1116
01:33:18,604 --> 01:33:26,604
"We salute everyone as soon as
the curtain rises and falls."

1117
01:33:27,624 --> 01:33:31,424
"We work in this drama."

1118
01:33:31,677 --> 01:33:35,765
"Life is a drama."

1119
01:33:36,086 --> 01:33:41,052
"We work in this drama."

1120
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:21,646
Suresh, don't go too fast.

1121
01:34:26,831 --> 01:34:29,952
Suresh, I am telling you,
don't go too fast.

1122
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:33,048
Wait Suresh, I am telling you, wait.

1123
01:34:33,707 --> 01:34:35,344
Suresh.

1124
01:34:36,780 --> 01:34:38,331
Wait Suresh.

1125
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:41,456
Suresh, I am telling you, wait.

1126
01:34:41,832 --> 01:34:43,904
Wait Suresh.

1127
01:34:44,024 --> 01:34:46,726
Suresh, I am telling you, wait.

1128
01:34:50,092 --> 01:34:52,888
Wait Suresh, I am telling you, wait.

1129
01:34:53,024 --> 01:34:56,258
Suresh, wait Suresh. Wait.

1130
01:35:02,559 --> 01:35:03,999
That's why I was telling you not to.

1131
01:35:04,037 --> 01:35:05,544
You were facing so much danger.

1132
01:35:08,708 --> 01:35:10,744
You? Yes, me.

1133
01:35:11,023 --> 01:35:13,464
- You were..
- I am not dead. I am still alive.

1134
01:35:13,878 --> 01:35:15,668
But that girl had shot you.

1135
01:35:16,192 --> 01:35:17,784
That bullet had hit my hand.

1136
01:35:18,659 --> 01:35:20,687
So that the foolish girl
doesn't fire again..

1137
01:35:20,974 --> 01:35:23,558
I had consciously
fallen on the ground.

1138
01:35:34,943 --> 01:35:36,767
I had acted that I had died.

1139
01:35:37,882 --> 01:35:41,801
After you people had left I got
upon and smiled on my fortune.

1140
01:35:42,849 --> 01:35:44,744
Geeta also considered
me to be dead like you.

1141
01:35:46,193 --> 01:35:50,045
Asha, it is easy to murder but
very difficult to conceal it.

1142
01:35:51,244 --> 01:35:53,424
Fearing the police maybe she
had committed suicide.

1143
01:35:54,454 --> 01:35:58,224
And the stone on my way
was removed for ever.

1144
01:35:59,065 --> 01:36:00,704
You are such a big sinner.

1145
01:36:02,528 --> 01:36:05,144
- But I have committed no sin with you.
- Leave me.

1146
01:36:05,450 --> 01:36:06,824
How can I leave you, Asha?

1147
01:36:07,427 --> 01:36:10,224
You love me and you are getting
engaged to Suresh.

1148
01:36:10,721 --> 01:36:13,474
I am telling you, leave
my way. Let me go.

1149
01:36:14,099 --> 01:36:16,344
All right. On one condition.

1150
01:36:17,223 --> 01:36:20,104
Engagement with Suresh
and marriage with me.

1151
01:36:20,184 --> 01:36:21,624
I am telling you, leave me.

1152
01:36:22,291 --> 01:36:24,104
- When will you meet me again?
- Never.

1153
01:36:26,649 --> 01:36:30,787
All right. All right.
I will meet you myself.

1154
01:36:52,425 --> 01:36:55,224
- Yes, sir.
- Tea for two.

1155
01:36:56,715 --> 01:36:57,904
Thank you.

1156
01:37:10,872 --> 01:37:13,584
- Cigarette?
- Thank you very much.

1157
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:17,384
Wow, our brand is the same.

1158
01:37:17,781 --> 01:37:21,904
I am not habituated to smoke
but I do so sometimes.

1159
01:37:22,849 --> 01:37:25,184
But sir, I am crazy about
this very brand.

1160
01:37:30,028 --> 01:37:30,787
What will you take?

1161
01:37:30,867 --> 01:37:33,104
- Oh no. Thank you. Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

1162
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:35,224
- One large peg of whisky.
- Okay sir.

1163
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,013
Pardon me, I am very
shameless person.

1164
01:37:38,424 --> 01:37:39,920
I have already drunk
two pegs of whisky.

1165
01:37:39,944 --> 01:37:41,344
No, no, it's all right. Carry on.

1166
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:45,024
Look, a person cannot forget
two things in life.

1167
01:37:45,104 --> 01:37:47,874
One is alcohol and the
other is his love.

1168
01:37:48,305 --> 01:37:52,394
Wherever alcohol or
love is he finds it.

1169
01:37:52,799 --> 01:37:55,864
- You are right, sir.
- Well, leave it.

1170
01:37:56,499 --> 01:37:58,259
It seems you have recently
arrived in Shimla.

1171
01:37:58,390 --> 01:38:01,104
Yes, I had come here
once in childhood.

1172
01:38:02,123 --> 01:38:05,620
My youth has bloomed here.
Have you seen Shimla?

1173
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:08,104
Yes, I have seen some
and some is left.

1174
01:38:09,708 --> 01:38:13,024
There is a lot to see,
there is lot to know.

1175
01:38:13,357 --> 01:38:14,984
And I am one of them.

1176
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:18,504
You seem to be a very
interesting person.

1177
01:38:18,584 --> 01:38:22,544
Thank you. My name is
Ashok Verma. Your name?

1178
01:38:22,935 --> 01:38:27,429
My name is Suresh and this
is my fiancée Asha.

1179
01:38:29,135 --> 01:38:30,786
Greetings, Asha.

1180
01:38:32,041 --> 01:38:33,864
It seems you are recently engaged.

1181
01:38:34,224 --> 01:38:35,842
Your guess is correct.

1182
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:43,426
That is the guess. Your engagement
and my wedding.

1183
01:38:43,696 --> 01:38:44,784
Cheers.

1184
01:38:45,284 --> 01:38:46,904
That means even you are engaged.

1185
01:38:47,142 --> 01:38:49,582
When are you getting married? The
day you are getting married.

1186
01:38:49,861 --> 01:38:53,573
You crack good jokes. Who
is there with you here?

1187
01:38:54,355 --> 01:38:59,321
The one who is present
in front of you. Yes?

1188
01:38:59,591 --> 01:39:01,112
I am totally alone.

1189
01:39:02,835 --> 01:39:05,369
Then you need to get
married urgently.

1190
01:39:06,027 --> 01:39:07,944
Only if my needs will be fulfilled.

1191
01:39:08,494 --> 01:39:10,128
It will be. It surely will be.

1192
01:39:10,824 --> 01:39:13,144
I will come to your marriage.
When are you getting married?

1193
01:39:13,224 --> 01:39:16,304
I have told you, the
same day as yours.

1194
01:39:16,551 --> 01:39:20,504
You joke a lot. Is the
moment same too?

1195
01:39:22,227 --> 01:39:26,382
Yes, the same moment
and the same bride.

1196
01:39:42,211 --> 01:39:48,714
I had told that I am shameless
person but you didn't understand.

1197
01:39:52,413 --> 01:39:55,544
I know how to teach manners
to the shameless.

1198
01:40:21,653 --> 01:40:24,051
Beware if you ever misbehave
with anyone in the future.

1199
01:40:24,131 --> 01:40:25,504
Let's go.

1200
01:40:39,338 --> 01:40:40,634
You?

1201
01:40:40,959 --> 01:40:46,179
Neither you can forget me,
nor I can forget you.

1202
01:40:49,337 --> 01:40:51,024
These are your letters
and some photos..

1203
01:40:51,104 --> 01:40:53,904
Bearing the proof of our love.

1204
01:40:54,423 --> 01:40:56,744
It is enough to break with Suresh..

1205
01:40:56,824 --> 01:40:59,963
And join the broken relationship
with me. Isn't it?

1206
01:41:00,043 --> 01:41:02,384
What will you get from
my defamation and ruin?

1207
01:41:02,716 --> 01:41:05,784
I am sorry that I have not
got anything till now.

1208
01:41:06,348 --> 01:41:10,250
Even after bathing in the sea
of love, I am still thirsty.

1209
01:41:10,690 --> 01:41:12,064
Don't be so heartless.

1210
01:41:12,430 --> 01:41:14,624
My daddy is marrying me so happily.

1211
01:41:14,704 --> 01:41:16,784
Say that he is doing injustice.

1212
01:41:17,211 --> 01:41:19,373
Think about my daddy's honor Ashok.

1213
01:41:19,829 --> 01:41:25,133
I pray you. I beg you. Return
me these photos and letters.

1214
01:41:25,437 --> 01:41:30,386
All right, if you want I will
return you everything.

1215
01:41:31,281 --> 01:41:34,104
And I will go away from
your path for ever.

1216
01:41:34,879 --> 01:41:37,210
- But on one condition.
- What?

1217
01:41:38,156 --> 01:41:43,624
You will come to me as bride before
the wedding for a little while.

1218
01:41:43,704 --> 01:41:45,544
No. no, I won't come.

1219
01:41:50,250 --> 01:41:52,504
You will come. You will surely come.

1220
01:41:53,629 --> 01:41:57,615
Respected people deal their
respect with respect.

1221
01:42:01,181 --> 01:42:02,264
He is alive.

1222
01:42:02,344 --> 01:42:05,353
Yes, he is alive.

1223
01:42:06,654 --> 01:42:08,904
But, but you have said
something else.

1224
01:42:08,984 --> 01:42:10,424
I was having a misunderstanding.

1225
01:42:10,691 --> 01:42:13,107
Suneeta, even death fears the devil.

1226
01:42:13,529 --> 01:42:16,624
But why are you scared? He
is dead for you forever.

1227
01:42:16,704 --> 01:42:18,224
He has threatened me.

1228
01:42:18,597 --> 01:42:20,824
My photos and letters,
all are with him.

1229
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:24,104
That person can ruin with its help.

1230
01:42:24,831 --> 01:42:27,015
He can ground my daddy's honor.

1231
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:29,424
I fail to understand,
what to do Suneeta?

1232
01:42:30,106 --> 01:42:33,104
- What do I do?
- After all what does he want?

1233
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:36,863
He is forcing me to come to
his house on the wedding day.

1234
01:42:37,150 --> 01:42:41,069
No, this can never happen.
This can never happen.

1235
01:42:46,923 --> 01:42:49,869
All right, we will teach
him such a lesson..

1236
01:42:49,949 --> 01:42:51,744
That he will remember it for life.

1237
01:43:00,981 --> 01:43:02,839
Asha. You?

1238
01:43:03,396 --> 01:43:08,824
Is this a dream or am I cheated
by my drunkenness.

1239
01:43:09,157 --> 01:43:12,467
I am myself cheated. I have
forgotten everything.

1240
01:43:12,940 --> 01:43:14,461
I have come to you after changing.

1241
01:43:14,541 --> 01:43:16,744
Then I will change too, my queen.

1242
01:43:17,451 --> 01:43:20,017
I will change the entire
world for you.

1243
01:43:20,097 --> 01:43:23,224
The world I running well.
Only you have to change.

1244
01:43:23,885 --> 01:43:25,544
From today you won't drink alcohol.

1245
01:43:26,943 --> 01:43:29,444
To drink the alcohol of your lips..

1246
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:35,704
From today I won't drink
this alcohol. Happy now?

1247
01:43:38,363 --> 01:43:41,184
Before getting related to me, you
have to stay in your limits.

1248
01:43:41,774 --> 01:43:45,744
- Okay. Agreed.
- Then come with me. - Where?

1249
01:43:45,824 --> 01:43:47,095
To the temple.

1250
01:43:47,175 --> 01:43:49,384
You will have to promise
in front of God..

1251
01:43:49,629 --> 01:43:51,824
That you won't cheat
me even in your dreams.

1252
01:43:52,805 --> 01:43:54,144
Agreed. Agreed.

1253
01:43:54,630 --> 01:43:57,504
But you will have to take
an oath with me too. What?

1254
01:43:57,584 --> 01:43:59,544
You have to marry me.

1255
01:43:59,624 --> 01:44:02,333
Ashok, how many times will
you make me promise?

1256
01:44:02,688 --> 01:44:05,120
I have come to you breaking
all relations.

1257
01:44:05,914 --> 01:44:08,744
Okay, I trust you.

1258
01:44:09,326 --> 01:44:13,060
Come, let's us go take our
oaths in front of your God.

1259
01:44:13,499 --> 01:44:16,224
- Bihari.
- Yes, sir. - I am just coming.

1260
01:44:38,078 --> 01:44:39,744
Come, come Suneeta.

1261
01:44:40,037 --> 01:44:41,440
- Did Asha come?
- Yes, she had come.

1262
01:44:41,464 --> 01:44:43,584
She had just gone outside
with Ashok sir.

1263
01:44:46,439 --> 01:44:49,294
- You are not well.
- I have a cough.

1264
01:44:55,342 --> 01:44:56,704
Take, take some water.

1265
01:44:57,217 --> 01:44:58,873
Not water, quickly bring
this medicine.

1266
01:44:58,953 --> 01:45:00,494
- I will just bring it.
- Come quickly.

1267
01:45:00,916 --> 01:45:03,839
Even if I go running, it will
at least take half an hour.

1268
01:45:13,146 --> 01:45:16,069
Priest pray for us.

1269
01:45:16,711 --> 01:45:19,549
And do such veneration that
the Goddess is pleased today.

1270
01:45:19,629 --> 01:45:22,264
Tell me, how much are you going
to donate? 100 rupees.

1271
01:45:22,624 --> 01:45:25,023
Why 100 rupees, priest? Offer 500.

1272
01:45:28,908 --> 01:45:31,273
I forgot my purse at home.
I will just go and call.

1273
01:45:31,353 --> 01:45:34,224
Leave it Ashok, we will
venerate later some day.

1274
01:45:34,304 --> 01:45:38,104
No, Asha, today the biggest wish of
my life is going to get fulfilled.

1275
01:45:38,537 --> 01:45:39,864
Priest, we are just coming.

1276
01:45:55,952 --> 01:45:57,424
Sister, you?

1277
01:45:59,718 --> 01:46:03,333
Yes, Munni, I had heard your
and Asha's conversation.

1278
01:46:03,570 --> 01:46:06,065
- Hurry up, he might come.
- Yes.

1279
01:46:15,225 --> 01:46:17,886
- Hello.
- Bihari, where were you?

1280
01:46:18,134 --> 01:46:21,624
I had gone to bring
medicine for Suneeta.

1281
01:46:23,875 --> 01:46:26,624
For Suneeta? What is she doing?

1282
01:46:27,096 --> 01:46:29,104
Maybe she is inside.

1283
01:46:29,939 --> 01:46:31,184
All right.

1284
01:46:34,144 --> 01:46:37,384
Suneeta, where are you?
Suneeta. Suneeta.

1285
01:46:39,021 --> 01:46:43,544
Open the door. Open the
door. Open the door.

1286
01:46:48,621 --> 01:46:50,104
Ashok! This is it.

1287
01:46:57,173 --> 01:46:59,224
- Hurry up, Munni.
- Come.

1288
01:47:15,594 --> 01:47:17,205
Come, give me the file.

1289
01:48:39,735 --> 01:48:41,021
No.

1290
01:49:24,893 --> 01:49:28,634
Mother. Mother. People from
Nainital had sent a letter.

1291
01:49:28,714 --> 01:49:31,455
- What has they written?
- They written. We like Uma.

1292
01:49:31,893 --> 01:49:33,373
There is no question of dowry.

1293
01:49:34,449 --> 01:49:36,968
This is the fruit of Asha's
benevolence and your service.

1294
01:49:38,213 --> 01:49:40,049
That day I will also
eat lot of fruits.

1295
01:49:41,595 --> 01:49:43,854
You give others your share of fruit.

1296
01:49:44,990 --> 01:49:46,493
This is where intelligence
is, sister.

1297
01:49:46,774 --> 01:49:48,613
All right mamma, I am
going to the emporium.

1298
01:52:44,666 --> 01:52:45,973
What has happened to her?

1299
01:52:46,827 --> 01:52:51,253
Don't worry. Sometimes she
has such attacks. Uma. Uma.

1300
01:53:13,032 --> 01:53:14,213
What do you want?

1301
01:53:14,859 --> 01:53:16,893
What I want is not in your shop.

1302
01:53:17,475 --> 01:53:19,356
I don't have time for useless talks.

1303
01:53:19,893 --> 01:53:22,973
Where do I have the time,
madam? I am too busy.

1304
01:53:23,133 --> 01:53:25,533
Tell me quickly, what do you want,
otherwise I will tell sir.

1305
01:53:26,252 --> 01:53:28,093
Do you know the meaning
to complain to sir?

1306
01:53:29,214 --> 01:53:30,893
It is to lose Uma forever.

1307
01:53:30,973 --> 01:53:32,053
What did you say?

1308
01:53:32,973 --> 01:53:35,653
You have surely burned my and
Asha's letters and photographs.

1309
01:53:36,613 --> 01:53:38,693
But not your sister's happiness.

1310
01:53:39,496 --> 01:53:41,213
You cannot come near her happiness.

1311
01:53:41,293 --> 01:53:42,188
What do you mean?

1312
01:53:42,268 --> 01:53:43,377
The meaning is straight.

1313
01:53:43,613 --> 01:53:46,013
The wedding procession and the
groom will come to your house.

1314
01:53:46,361 --> 01:53:48,773
But the bride, that is
Uma won't be there.

1315
01:53:50,167 --> 01:53:51,293
She is in my clutches.

1316
01:53:51,373 --> 01:53:54,550
What? To get Uma you have
to break the union..

1317
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:57,043
Of Suresh and Asha you have made.

1318
01:53:57,335 --> 01:54:01,213
You had enacted that drama for Asha.

1319
01:54:01,897 --> 01:54:03,853
Now for me you have to
tell Suresh the truth.

1320
01:54:04,740 --> 01:54:05,973
Listen to it once more.

1321
01:54:06,491 --> 01:54:09,173
Asha will come to my house
on the wedding night.

1322
01:54:10,026 --> 01:54:13,093
And at that moment Uma will
step into your house.

1323
01:54:13,293 --> 01:54:14,373
Good night.

1324
01:54:18,189 --> 01:54:21,573
You have come too. It is dark.

1325
01:54:22,873 --> 01:54:24,927
But your sister has
not come till now.

1326
01:54:29,619 --> 01:54:32,173
Don't worry mother. She
is at Asha's place.

1327
01:54:32,862 --> 01:54:36,235
- How do you know?
- Asha had called me at the shop.

1328
01:54:36,754 --> 01:54:39,733
What a crazy girl? She
could have told me.

1329
01:54:40,819 --> 01:54:42,883
I was anticipating such bad things.

1330
01:54:44,170 --> 01:54:47,213
She is a young girl and
the world has evil eyes.

1331
01:54:53,921 --> 01:54:56,109
Why have you brought
me here? Tell me.

1332
01:54:57,586 --> 01:54:58,733
To appease my thirst.

1333
01:54:59,662 --> 01:55:02,173
I am telling you. I beg you.

1334
01:55:02,693 --> 01:55:05,333
For God's sake let me
go home, Ashok, please.

1335
01:55:05,726 --> 01:55:07,613
I have brought you from God's house.

1336
01:55:08,492 --> 01:55:10,773
And you are saying let
me go for God's sake.

1337
01:55:12,925 --> 01:55:13,925
Come in.

1338
01:55:24,037 --> 01:55:26,493
You must be hungry,
have some fruits.

1339
01:55:39,325 --> 01:55:42,190
Today you will be
paid for your sins.

1340
01:55:43,844 --> 01:55:45,973
Yes, I am burning like anything.

1341
01:55:46,990 --> 01:55:49,718
- Give me the knife.
- Move from my way.

1342
01:55:51,432 --> 01:55:55,563
I will stab you scoundrel,
rascal, dog Ashok.

1343
01:55:56,200 --> 01:55:59,260
You men think women
to be toys, right.

1344
01:55:59,769 --> 01:56:01,093
You regard them to be weak.

1345
01:56:01,173 --> 01:56:05,844
But if she wants she can fix
thousands of men like you.

1346
01:56:07,131 --> 01:56:08,573
Scoundrel.

1347
01:56:13,336 --> 01:56:14,613
You can't, you understand?

1348
01:56:16,947 --> 01:56:19,845
No. no.

1349
01:56:33,322 --> 01:56:39,724
I am telling you come here. You go.
Come here. Come here.

1350
01:56:39,804 --> 01:56:45,151
No, Ashok. Please stop.
Ashok, leave me.

1351
01:56:47,551 --> 01:56:49,713
- Now I will only release your corpse.
- No.

1352
01:56:50,481 --> 01:56:52,763
- Leave this sari.
- No.

1353
01:56:53,130 --> 01:56:56,767
- I will have you dishonored.
- No, leave me.

1354
01:56:57,465 --> 01:57:02,030
I won't spare you. You
have ruined my plans.

1355
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:05,163
I have told mother that Uma
sister is in your house.

1356
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:09,823
But what do we do now?

1357
01:57:10,850 --> 01:57:12,872
How can we release her
from that devil?

1358
01:57:13,434 --> 01:57:17,134
Madam, a sir told you to give
this packet especially to you.

1359
01:57:24,747 --> 01:57:27,396
This is Uma sister's sari.

1360
01:57:34,195 --> 01:57:35,088
'Dear Asha.'

1361
01:57:35,168 --> 01:57:36,646
'Right now your dear friend
Suneeta's sister..

1362
01:57:36,670 --> 01:57:37,990
Is in my clutches right now.'

1363
01:57:38,282 --> 01:57:41,510
'The proof of it is this
sari. Don't worry.'

1364
01:57:41,848 --> 01:57:43,243
'Her honor can be saved..

1365
01:57:43,448 --> 01:57:46,670
If come to me before going
to the wedding altar.'

1366
01:57:46,893 --> 01:57:49,859
'Otherwise you know.. Yours Ashok.'

1367
01:57:54,053 --> 01:57:57,893
Light all the lamps and brighten
the entire house.

1368
01:57:57,973 --> 01:58:00,173
Master, is some special guest
going to come today?

1369
01:58:00,893 --> 01:58:03,893
Not guest but the mistress
to-be of this bungalow.

1370
01:58:04,218 --> 01:58:06,133
Who will step into this
house like a new bride.

1371
01:58:06,213 --> 01:58:07,973
Bride? But the marriage?

1372
01:58:08,595 --> 01:58:10,044
The marriage might be taking place.

1373
01:58:10,413 --> 01:58:11,929
The instruments might be playing.

1374
01:58:12,653 --> 01:58:17,871
But the bride. The bride will
be here. You won't understand.

1375
01:58:18,434 --> 01:58:19,893
Leave me alone tonight.

1376
01:58:20,077 --> 01:58:23,104
- Tiger take care of the outside.
- Okay sir.

1377
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:35,062
It seems the wedding
procession has come.

1378
01:58:35,086 --> 01:58:36,253
Let's go. Let's go.

1379
01:58:45,817 --> 01:58:49,571
No, Asha. The wedding day
is a very happy day.

1380
01:58:50,241 --> 01:58:53,116
And such happiness comes only
once in a girl's life.

1381
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:55,728
You shouldn't be sad
in such good time.

1382
01:58:55,927 --> 01:59:01,201
- Suneeta, I am scared.
- Don't worry about anything.

1383
01:59:01,385 --> 01:59:05,969
- Everything will be fine.
- But, but he has threatened me.

1384
01:59:07,915 --> 01:59:09,515
A threatening is a threatening,
Asha.

1385
01:59:10,693 --> 01:59:16,229
Suneeta, this good day
has come to my life..

1386
01:59:16,477 --> 01:59:17,893
Only because of you.

1387
01:59:18,673 --> 01:59:21,635
I will be forever indebted
to you, Suneeta.

1388
01:59:21,808 --> 01:59:24,143
- I can't forget it.
- Crazy girl.

1389
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:26,533
Am I a stranger that you
are talking like this?

1390
01:59:27,373 --> 01:59:32,575
May God make this new life of
yours bloom with happiness.

1391
01:59:36,294 --> 01:59:41,498
The new life will start only when
the seven rounds will get over.

1392
01:59:50,925 --> 01:59:55,401
- Let Uma go.
- You mean I should release her like this.

1393
01:59:56,158 --> 01:59:58,293
I mean, she doesn't have
clothes on her body.

1394
01:59:58,373 --> 02:00:00,136
I have brought her sari along.

1395
02:00:01,314 --> 02:00:02,832
All right, I will release her.

1396
02:00:03,477 --> 02:00:05,413
Uma doesn't have any problem
in this house.

1397
02:00:06,319 --> 02:00:08,417
Two men are outside to guard.

1398
02:00:08,979 --> 02:00:10,653
A maid is their in the
house to serve her.

1399
02:00:11,001 --> 02:00:13,391
- What more does she want?
- But you had promised.

1400
02:00:13,650 --> 02:00:14,807
Then when have I refused?

1401
02:00:15,822 --> 02:00:17,893
But I am not such a fool
that I will release her..

1402
02:00:17,973 --> 02:00:19,693
As soon as I see you.

1403
02:00:21,465 --> 02:00:24,413
First let me drink the
juice of your beauty.

1404
02:00:25,303 --> 02:00:27,893
Let us get one by body and heart.

1405
02:00:28,860 --> 02:00:31,152
- After that I will release Uma.
- Ashok.

1406
02:00:31,768 --> 02:00:34,212
I have not run from
the marriage hall..

1407
02:00:34,439 --> 02:00:37,453
So that I can return home.
I have come for you.

1408
02:00:37,779 --> 02:00:40,493
I can show you my face only
to you and not the world.

1409
02:00:40,914 --> 02:00:43,887
Release Uma, Ashok. Her family
is waiting for her.

1410
02:00:43,967 --> 02:00:45,733
Even I am waiting for
you since years.

1411
02:00:47,022 --> 02:00:49,893
But I am not going to
come into talks..

1412
02:00:49,973 --> 02:00:51,413
Till you don't come into my arms.

1413
02:00:51,898 --> 02:00:53,314
Till you don't become mine.

1414
02:00:54,179 --> 02:00:55,649
Will you agree to one thing of mine?

1415
02:00:56,244 --> 02:00:57,893
If it is agreeable I
will surely agree.

1416
02:00:57,973 --> 02:01:01,453
Show me Uma once and allow
me to give her this sari.

1417
02:01:04,567 --> 02:01:07,293
All right, you can see her.

1418
02:01:08,459 --> 02:01:09,627
Come with me.

1419
02:01:14,232 --> 02:01:15,453
See her.

1420
02:01:16,372 --> 02:01:22,080
- Asha. Asha.
- Wear these clothes, Uma. - Asha.

1421
02:01:22,383 --> 02:01:26,686
- Come. - No.
- Enough, come. Don't be scared.

1422
02:01:30,156 --> 02:01:31,421
Have you seen her?

1423
02:01:31,594 --> 02:01:34,863
- I have seen her but still I haven't.
- Come with me.

1424
02:01:45,259 --> 02:01:46,344
Take.

1425
02:01:47,550 --> 02:01:48,830
What is this?

1426
02:01:50,393 --> 02:01:52,973
That day you were acting
to change me.

1427
02:01:54,804 --> 02:01:58,003
But today, today I will
really change you.

1428
02:01:58,652 --> 02:02:00,253
I will change you completely.

1429
02:02:00,609 --> 02:02:03,213
You know, I don't drink alcohol.

1430
02:02:04,825 --> 02:02:08,891
All right, but you have
to drink today.

1431
02:02:09,356 --> 02:02:13,973
Forget that you are Asha.
Drink it. Drink it.

1432
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:20,134
Drink it. Drink it. Yes. Drink it.

1433
02:02:22,631 --> 02:02:24,631
That's it.
Drink.

1434
02:02:33,820 --> 02:02:35,373
Very good.

1435
02:02:40,576 --> 02:02:41,733
Drink more.

1436
02:02:48,613 --> 02:02:50,173
If you keep on drinking like this..

1437
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:52,733
Then you will forget
yourself completely.

1438
02:03:14,145 --> 02:03:16,493
Really, I have forgotten everything.

1439
02:03:18,306 --> 02:03:20,208
I have forgotten the
limits of a woman.

1440
02:03:21,160 --> 02:03:23,533
I have forgotten the
society and God.

1441
02:03:26,090 --> 02:03:28,609
Now I can see only you.

1442
02:03:59,529 --> 02:04:07,486
"If I remove the veil from my face,
then knives will be used."

1443
02:04:07,566 --> 02:04:15,162
"If I remove the veil from my face,
then knives will be used."

1444
02:04:15,242 --> 02:04:20,275
"If I lower my eyes down."

1445
02:04:20,355 --> 02:04:27,972
"If I lower my eyes down, then
the arrow will be fired."

1446
02:04:28,052 --> 02:04:36,052
"If I remove the veil from my face,
then knives will be used."

1447
02:05:07,310 --> 02:05:12,315
"My love, my youth."

1448
02:05:12,618 --> 02:05:17,213
"My love, my youth."

1449
02:05:17,677 --> 02:05:22,456
"Human beings have long story."

1450
02:05:22,694 --> 02:05:27,267
"My love, my youth."

1451
02:05:29,277 --> 02:05:34,133
"If I relate this story to you."

1452
02:05:34,213 --> 02:05:41,808
"If I relate this story to you,
then the night will end."

1453
02:05:41,888 --> 02:05:49,786
"If I remove the veil from my face,
then knives will be used."

1454
02:06:15,980 --> 02:06:20,964
"There are so many fake
curtains on the eyes."

1455
02:06:21,044 --> 02:06:25,732
"There are so many fake
curtains on the eyes."

1456
02:06:26,013 --> 02:06:30,973
"The face behind the face is real.'

1457
02:06:31,191 --> 02:06:35,905
"There are so many fake
curtains on the eyes."

1458
02:06:37,808 --> 02:06:42,661
"If I show you that form."

1459
02:06:42,741 --> 02:06:50,359
"If I show you that form, then
the color will change."

1460
02:06:50,439 --> 02:06:58,439
"If I remove the veil from my face,
then knives will be used."

1461
02:07:34,975 --> 02:07:39,853
"My attitudes and my mannerisms.'

1462
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:44,749
"My attitudes and my mannerisms.'

1463
02:07:45,181 --> 02:07:49,830
"All my secrets are
behind the curtain."

1464
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:54,673
"My attitudes and my mannerisms.'

1465
02:07:56,684 --> 02:08:01,515
"If I tell you this secret."

1466
02:08:01,595 --> 02:08:09,093
"If I tell you this secret,
then life will come.."

1467
02:08:22,425 --> 02:08:23,711
Enough!

1468
02:08:23,893 --> 02:08:26,689
This life will not end
so soon, my love.

1469
02:08:28,436 --> 02:08:30,133
Knives will be used.

1470
02:08:32,402 --> 02:08:39,137
Betrayer, you want to kill me
after fooling me with trust.

1471
02:08:39,494 --> 02:08:41,973
- You want to take my life.
- Sir, Uma has fled.

1472
02:08:42,478 --> 02:08:43,653
Uman has fled?

1473
02:08:51,775 --> 02:08:56,165
Where are you going? I have
understood your plans, rascal.

1474
02:08:56,749 --> 02:09:00,251
The witch who had cheated me.
I will ruin you now.

1475
02:09:00,813 --> 02:09:01,973
Ashok.

1476
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:18,693
Ashok, don't ruin her. Respect
her. Let her go.

1477
02:09:18,773 --> 02:09:21,613
Why did you do this, Asha?
Today is your wedding.

1478
02:09:21,981 --> 02:09:23,440
Why did you come here?

1479
02:09:24,219 --> 02:09:25,373
Asha.

1480
02:09:39,805 --> 02:09:44,333
A blind person asks for one
eye and God grants him two.

1481
02:09:44,908 --> 02:09:46,346
Not bad.

1482
02:09:47,005 --> 02:09:48,259
That's good.

1483
02:09:48,756 --> 02:09:50,075
- Asha.
- Suneeta.

1484
02:09:50,248 --> 02:09:52,373
- Asha.
- Suneeta.

1485
02:09:53,329 --> 02:09:56,533
- Suneeta, you had drank alcohol?
- Yes.

1486
02:09:57,307 --> 02:10:00,653
Crazy girl, I can even
drink poison for you.

1487
02:10:01,005 --> 02:10:04,886
Truly Ashok, you are not
a man but a devil.

1488
02:10:04,966 --> 02:10:05,966
You are a beast.

1489
02:10:06,014 --> 02:10:09,912
Ask this cheater of a girl
if I am a man or a devil.

1490
02:10:11,080 --> 02:10:14,893
Ashok, you wanted
me to come to you..

1491
02:10:15,696 --> 02:10:19,555
- Before going to the marriage altar.
- No.

1492
02:10:20,095 --> 02:10:23,773
I have come. Now release her,
Ashok. Release her.

1493
02:10:23,853 --> 02:10:28,031
It will not end like this.
I will marry you right now.

1494
02:10:28,111 --> 02:10:31,199
And her. I will keep
her as my slave.

1495
02:10:31,437 --> 02:10:34,723
- Ashok.
- No. - Ashok. - Leave me. No.

1496
02:10:35,145 --> 02:10:36,493
Leave me.

1497
02:10:42,679 --> 02:10:44,014
Leave me.

1498
02:11:57,846 --> 02:12:00,293
- Ganga. - Yes, sir.
- Take these two. - No, no.

1499
02:12:00,485 --> 02:12:02,528
- Come, come sweetheart.
- No.

1500
02:12:02,608 --> 02:12:05,447
You shouldn't refuse.
Come, let's go upstairs.

1501
02:12:05,933 --> 02:12:09,414
Leave me. Leave me.

1502
02:12:11,263 --> 02:12:13,773
- This side. This side.
- No, no, no.

1503
02:12:15,802 --> 02:12:18,225
That's it. You shouldn't
bother me too much.

1504
02:12:20,893 --> 02:12:22,973
One day in this place,
in this room..

1505
02:12:23,749 --> 02:12:26,333
I tried to make a girl
the victim of my lust.

1506
02:12:27,493 --> 02:12:30,819
Your father punished and ruined me.

1507
02:12:33,771 --> 02:12:37,285
And today. Today I will
ruin you and punish her.

1508
02:12:37,365 --> 02:12:41,973
No, no, Ashok. Don't do this.
Don't do this. No, no.

1509
02:12:53,263 --> 02:12:56,326
Leave her. No. No.

1510
02:14:26,651 --> 02:14:28,338
Hey. Where?

1511
02:14:28,673 --> 02:14:30,068
- There.
- No, outside.

1512
02:14:30,327 --> 02:14:31,592
Okay. No problem.

1513
02:14:45,311 --> 02:14:46,360
Why did you hit him?

1514
02:14:46,440 --> 02:14:48,760
- I am sorry. I committed a mistake.
- Committed a mistake?

1515
02:14:51,895 --> 02:14:53,893
Should I tell you why I had hit him?

1516
02:15:02,166 --> 02:15:03,604
Mother.

1517
02:15:30,306 --> 02:15:31,409
No.

1518
02:15:31,863 --> 02:15:33,213
- Move aside.
- No, Ashok.

1519
02:15:33,613 --> 02:15:35,613
Come with me. Come with me.

1520
02:15:36,144 --> 02:15:38,479
Nobody will try to move
from their places.

1521
02:15:50,197 --> 02:15:51,300
No.

1522
02:15:58,360 --> 02:15:59,693
No.

1523
02:16:08,424 --> 02:16:09,773
Suneeta.

1524
02:16:13,873 --> 02:16:14,973
Wait.

1525
02:16:16,759 --> 02:16:18,653
You cannot take Asha,
till I am here.

1526
02:16:18,867 --> 02:16:21,493
Why do you want to play
with your life? Go back.

1527
02:16:21,573 --> 02:16:25,773
My life. Only cowards
love their lives. Fire.

1528
02:16:25,853 --> 02:16:29,101
No, no, Suneeta. Move aside.

1529
02:16:29,181 --> 02:16:31,473
This devil will shoot you, Suneeta.

1530
02:16:32,683 --> 02:16:35,007
No, Munni.

1531
02:16:47,731 --> 02:16:49,223
What did you do, Asha?

1532
02:16:49,303 --> 02:16:51,453
Daughter! What happened? Daughter.

1533
02:16:53,200 --> 02:16:56,005
The drama has ended now.

1534
02:16:56,790 --> 02:17:01,613
I have been punished for
my mistake. Daddy.

1535
02:17:01,785 --> 02:17:03,980
- Daughter.
- Daddy.

1536
02:17:05,288 --> 02:17:07,813
Suneeta is your daughter, daddy.

1537
02:17:07,990 --> 02:17:10,320
She is your daughter.

1538
02:17:11,017 --> 02:17:14,613
Suresh. Suresh.

1539
02:17:14,930 --> 02:17:17,230
Suneeta loves you.

1540
02:17:17,309 --> 02:17:18,612
She was..

1541
02:17:19,648 --> 02:17:27,034
She was sacrificing her love for me.

1542
02:17:29,992 --> 02:17:31,211
Suresh.

1543
02:17:33,692 --> 02:17:34,868
Suneeta.

1544
02:17:38,743 --> 02:17:40,387
The two of you..

1545
02:17:41,329 --> 02:17:45,053
- Let your love should remain immortal.
- Asha.

1546
02:17:45,133 --> 02:17:47,133
- Daughter. Daughter.
- Asha.

1547
02:17:47,893 --> 02:17:52,401
- Asha.
- Daughter. - Asha. Asha. Asha.

1548
02:17:52,481 --> 02:17:56,959
"Life is a drama."

1549
02:17:57,495 --> 02:18:02,088
"We work in this drama."

1550
02:18:02,486 --> 02:18:10,486
"We salute everyone as soon as
the curtain rises and falls."

1551
02:18:12,004 --> 02:18:15,801
"We work in this drama."
