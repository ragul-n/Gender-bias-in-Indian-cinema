1
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,042
Your daughter?
- Yes, sir. She was missing for 6 months.

2
00:03:37,292 --> 00:03:40,375
May Allah bless-
Fine, fine, it's alright.

3
00:03:41,417 --> 00:03:44,958
Few men left her here and went off.

4
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:48,167
They spoke of avenging the Noakhali riots.

5
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:54,625
What are you doing?
Listen to me carefully.

6
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:59,292
Your daughter is still alive.
Be thankful for that.

7
00:03:59,417 --> 00:04:01,333
Come, let's go.

8
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:07,917
Now let us cheer for our country,
and repeat after me thrice -

9
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:10,958
Long live...
- India!

10
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,583
Long live...
- India!

11
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:16,333
Long live...
- India!

12
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,000
Long live...
- India!

13
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:29,250
Fatima?

14
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:31,208
Fatima!

15
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,250
Fatima! My dear!

16
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:38,542
Fatima? It's your father.
I am here. Fatima?

17
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,625
Fatima? Please say something.

18
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,583
This is your father.

19
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,375
Fatima, my dear. Where were you?

20
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,750
I've been looking for you for months.
Oh Fatima?

21
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,958
Fatima? Are you ok?
Fatima?

22
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,958
Fatima? Fatima!

23
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:03,167
Fatima?

24
00:05:03,333 --> 00:05:07,958
Why don't you say something?
Your mother is waiting for you.

25
00:05:08,292 --> 00:05:14,250
She hasn't seen you for years.
She yearns for you.

26
00:05:14,792 --> 00:05:17,042
Open the windows.

27
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,250
Let's go back home now.

28
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,375
Why do you lie there like a stone?

29
00:05:23,708 --> 00:05:25,958
Didn't you hear me?
Come on, open!

30
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,708
My dear?

31
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,708
Come now, let's go.

32
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,167
Oh Allah!

33
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:18,083
How did this happen?

34
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:13,250
No Women's Land

35
00:07:35,417 --> 00:07:36,833
Good morning, sir.

36
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,167
This way.

37
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,875
Welcome, dear Radcliffe.

38
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:09,125
Welcome to India.

39
00:08:09,292 --> 00:08:15,250
<i>And then, he stormed in, snatched
the bronze lamp and flung it away.</i>

40
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:21,708
<i>The lamp smashed against a stone,
& was shattered to pieces!</i>

41
00:08:21,958 --> 00:08:23,542
<i>And the Sun God's image-</i>

42
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,500
What does the Sun God look like?

43
00:08:25,667 --> 00:08:29,042
Like Lord Shiva?
- Oh God! Only questions.

44
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:32,083
Will you shut up and listen?

45
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:39,167
<i>So a black stone fell off the wall.</i>

46
00:08:39,542 --> 00:08:47,167
<i>Subhaga cried, "You fool! What did you do?
Destroyed the Sun Temple & insulted the Gods?"</i>

47
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,833
<i>Gayeb said, "I don't care about the Gods.</i>

48
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,875
<i>Tell me! Whose son am I? Or else-</i>

49
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,000
Whose daughter am I?

50
00:08:55,042 --> 00:08:58,500
Little rascal! Why do you
ask so many questions?

51
00:08:58,583 --> 00:09:00,458
Can't you shut up & listen?

52
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,875
Let it be. I'll return the book
when Professor comes.

53
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,833
You are impossible-
Bnuchki!

54
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,042
Go take a bath quickly.
Grandma, Begum Jaan is calling us.

55
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:15,333
I'm in quite a mess, it seems.

56
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,667
Well, I wouldn't disagree.

57
00:09:17,792 --> 00:09:20,792
Which is why I would suggest to you,
stay away from the hearings.

58
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,375
But surely my Lord, if I'm chairman of
a committee, I would need to preside.

59
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,643
There are meetings I've to set up.
There are people I've got to meet-

60
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,500
My dear sir.
Do you know what this is?

61
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,667
No, my Lord.

62
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:39,374
It is one list of many prepared
by the Separation Council.

63
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:43,583
Of the administrative assets to be
divided between India & Pakistan.

64
00:09:45,542 --> 00:09:46,750
Let's see.

65
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:50,000
Durries, table lamps, iron safes...

66
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,083
cash boxes, cycles,

67
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,167
typewriters, electrical heaters,

68
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:57,667
magnifying glasses & many more.

69
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,125
Now Radcliffe, add to that,
government officials,

70
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,958
the Army, roads,

71
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,750
railway lines, bridges,

72
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,625
trees, rivers...

73
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,208
You could add the damned Himalayas
& the Thar desert for all you know.

74
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,250
I don't comprehend, my Lord.

75
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:23,792
We're about to cut through a
5000 year old civilisation here, Radcliffe.

76
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,375
And the people are going
to be very, very angry.

77
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:30,625
In light of the impending partition
of the land we proudly call India...

78
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:32,625
The All India Congress Committee,

79
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:33,792
would like to submit...

80
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,433
its modest
claims and suggestions...

81
00:10:35,542 --> 00:10:37,333
for the facilitation of the same.

82
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:40,125
As discussed in our recent sessions...

83
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:42,708
we moot a separate proposal
to the Congress scheme...

84
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,333
as previously submitted
to your Lordships.

85
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,000
This new proposal...

86
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,000
is to be referred to
henceforth as the Congress Plan.

87
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:55,917
And in our view is infinitely
fairer to our Muslim brothers.

88
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:59,417
The largest stake that we claim
in a Muslim majority district...

89
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:02,000
would be that of Murshidabad.

90
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:06,917
Which we consider to be-
Order, order!

91
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,125
Which we... which we-
Order, order!

92
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:17,250
Which we consider to be of
vital importance, Your Lordships.

93
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:22,458
It would be blatantly unfair if...

94
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:26,750
Khulna, Faridpur & Bakarganj
are included as a part of India.

95
00:11:27,042 --> 00:11:30,208
We must also remember that...

96
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:33,417
all the jute fields
will be on our side...

97
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,417
while the mills will be in Calcutta.

98
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,583
That's why we request you...

99
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:43,833
to include Calcutta in
Pakistan and-

100
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:45,833
Order! Order in the court!

101
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,000
What's wrong with you?
Bloody whore!

102
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,958
Have you gone mad, you bitch?

103
00:11:56,458 --> 00:12:00,375
The same routine, bloody slut!

104
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:03,083
Why whore if you're insane?

105
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:05,500
I'll tell Begum Jaan-
Take that!

106
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,917
Bloody dickhead! Didn't I tell
you not to touch my breasts?

107
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,917
Dare do that again &
I'll castrate your tiny tool!

108
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,792
Hey Golap! Why scream
this early in the morning?

109
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,167
Begum Jaan beckons. Come fast.

110
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:27,917
Father or husband?

111
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,250
Or is it the brother?

112
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:34,708
The father, Begum Jaan.

113
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:36,875
He deserted her.

114
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,708
Oh my!

115
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:51,042
My dear! Better get this straight.

116
00:12:51,417 --> 00:12:54,625
All men are assholes.

117
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,542
Remember. All men.

118
00:13:00,792 --> 00:13:03,792
So he deserted you, sweetie?

119
00:13:04,042 --> 00:13:05,292
Huh?

120
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:12,042
What's your name?

121
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,750
Your name is...

122
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:43,542
Shabnam.

123
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,792
Keep that in mind.

124
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,000
Grandma, take her away.

125
00:13:58,292 --> 00:14:00,458
Give her a bath & get her ready.

126
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,250
Sujan! Get some clothes from the town.

127
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:08,583
Jui, Golap, Lata. Train her well.

128
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:10,625
And Mirza,

129
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:14,292
if any relatives or the police
enquire about her,

130
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:16,375
tell them that Begum Jaan
has sheltered her.

131
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,667
So they should stop searching.

132
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:20,167
Yes, Begum Jaan.

133
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:30,375
Wait, wait, wait!

134
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,875
Come here.

135
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,500
Sit. Sit here.

136
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,042
Sit.

137
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,167
It hurt a lot, didn't it, Shabnam?

138
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:08,083
Shock, huh?

139
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,500
Isn't it Shabnam?

140
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,042
Everything will be fine.

141
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,333
Everything will be fine.

142
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:16,208
Yes. That's better.
Grandma-

143
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,083
Take her away.

144
00:16:20,042 --> 00:16:22,875
Come along, my dear.

145
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,375
Cry & scream as much
as you want sweetie.

146
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,292
It'll be easier for you
to come back.

147
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,167
We went to Debiganj
Police station as well.

148
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,375
They said it was beyond
their jurisdiction.

149
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:47,583
That's why we came to you Sir-
We are also helpless.

150
00:16:48,458 --> 00:16:52,000
It is beyond the jurisdiction
of Haldibari Police station...

151
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,042
outside the town.

152
00:16:54,083 --> 00:16:57,292
The boys are growing up
& getting out of control.

153
00:16:57,875 --> 00:17:02,167
The shameless sluts sit there all day.
Makes it difficult to pass...

154
00:17:02,208 --> 00:17:04,042
the way they smoke and swear.

155
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:11,875
What did you expect, Mr.Ghosh?

156
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,333
Hymn-chanting harlots?

157
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,042
No, no, sir, it's not that.

158
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:24,333
But as you know, forget caste,
creed or character...

159
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,875
They spread deadly diseases.

160
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,375
Even laws of the past
couldn't prevent it.

161
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:35,750
Mr.Ghosh, last Saturday at
around 9:30PM...

162
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,875
where exactly were you?

163
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,208
Well... I mean...

164
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:45,708
Once a man visited
Mullah Naseeruddin.

165
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:50,292
Said his son is addicted to
sugar & needs to be cured.

166
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:55,958
Mulla asked him to come
after some time.

167
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,625
And then-
What are you trying to say, Sir?

168
00:17:59,875 --> 00:18:02,958
I am unable to-
Comprehend?

169
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:09,042
If you don't practice abstinence,
how will you preach it?

170
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,292
And what about Khulna?

171
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,042
It has a Hindu majority, right?

172
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:19,292
Well, yes. But as seen from
the Congress proposal...

173
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,917
though they most
certainly claim Khulna,

174
00:18:22,042 --> 00:18:25,375
they would happily trade it for the
Muslim majority Murshidabad.

175
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,542
And in this way...

176
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,625
one can maintain a more
or less 70:30 ratio...

177
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,750
between the majority &
minority in the 2 countries.

178
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:36,250
And what about awarding
Murshidabad to Pakistan?

179
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:39,458
That's like awarding Calcutta
to Pakistan, my Lord.

180
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:42,208
Because the river system which
feeds this part of Bengal...

181
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,518
would be totally destroyed if
the line enters the area-

182
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:46,583
Fine, fine. Got it.

183
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,333
You are leveraging in the
other factors bit...

184
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,750
in the partition principle.

185
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:55,667
No.

186
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,083
There is no question...

187
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,542
of awarding Calcutta to Pakistan.

188
00:18:59,708 --> 00:19:02,500
Or of refusing Congress, Murshidabad.

189
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,125
Hey!

190
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,750
Don't take another step!

191
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:17,042
Try hurting them if
you have the guts!

192
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:19,875
I, Salim Mirza, promise...

193
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,458
to kill you all, if
you try and pass.

194
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:24,833
Bloody eunuchs!

195
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,542
You call yourselves Muslims?

196
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:47,167
Stop!

197
00:19:56,917 --> 00:19:58,667
What a fight it was.

198
00:19:58,833 --> 00:20:01,083
Unbelievable!

199
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,750
But our Mirza took them
on singlehandedly.

200
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:06,500
100 people.

201
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:08,333
Singlehandedly.

202
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,833
He was a braveheart!

203
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:17,167
Faced 100 Muslims with
just a staff in hand.

204
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:18,833
They fled.

205
00:20:20,167 --> 00:20:21,833
All of them.

206
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,125
And our Mirza...

207
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:30,458
only rested after shepherding
them to a camp.

208
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,625
What a strange country!

209
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,542
What a strange government!

210
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,542
He got fired for killing Muslims.

211
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:40,625
What about the Hindus he saved?

212
00:20:40,708 --> 00:20:44,958
Grandma, are killing Hindus and
Muslims the same thing?

213
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,000
Frankly my Lord,

214
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:52,458
I don't have a very good
feeling about this.

215
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,792
This is my first visit to this country.

216
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,250
And I have no idea...

217
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,625
about its religions,

218
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,292
customs, polity and people.

219
00:21:01,542 --> 00:21:03,375
I've had barely 5 weeks...

220
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,792
to study the topographical
demographics-

221
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:08,167
What has to be done, has
to be done, Radcliffe.

222
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:10,292
And someone had to do it.

223
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:14,125
Well then, do we declare the line
at the assembly tomorrow?

224
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,583
Or do we call in for a press?

225
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:16,625
Neither.

226
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,000
But my Lord, weren't we in a hurry?

227
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,875
Nehru called thrice.

228
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,458
And so did Jinnah.

229
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:26,417
I mean weren't we planning on getting out
of here as soon as possible?

230
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:30,417
Make no mistake, Radcliffe.

231
00:21:30,792 --> 00:21:33,833
We're about to severe
the arms of a nation.

232
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:39,042
And it is going to be one bloody surgery.

233
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:42,000
We'd want proper
anaesthesia, right?

234
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,583
Anaesthesia?

235
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:52,000
The anaesthesia of Independence.

236
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:55,708
We will declare it a couple
of days after...

237
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,917
the euphoria of 15th August.

238
00:21:58,167 --> 00:21:59,500
<i>(Nehru's Voice) Long years ago...</i>

239
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:02,458
<i>we made a tryst with destiny,</i>

240
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,875
<i>and now the time comes...</i>

241
00:22:04,958 --> 00:22:07,208
<i>when we shall redeem our pledge,</i>

242
00:22:07,417 --> 00:22:09,958
<i>not wholly or in full measure,</i>

243
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,417
<i>but very substantially.</i>

244
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,542
<i>At the stroke of the midnight hour,</i>

245
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,375
<i>when the world sleeps,</i>

246
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,583
<i>India will awake to life and freedom.</i>

247
00:22:27,625 --> 00:22:29,250
<i>A moment comes,</i>

248
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,708
<i>which comes but rarely in history,</i>

249
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:35,167
<i>when we step out from
the old to the new,</i>

250
00:22:35,417 --> 00:22:36,958
<i>when an age ends,</i>

251
00:22:37,292 --> 00:22:39,333
<i>and when the soul of a nation,</i>

252
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,167
<i>long suppressed, finds utterance.</i>

253
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:44,875
<i>It is fitting that at this solemn moment...</i>

254
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,000
<i>we take the pledge of dedication...</i>

255
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:50,167
<i>to the service of India & her people...</i>

256
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:53,917
<i>and to the still
larger cause of humanity.</i>

257
00:22:54,583 --> 00:22:56,375
<i>At the dawn of history...</i>

258
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:59,583
<i>India started on her unending quest,</i>

259
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,333
<i>and the trackless centuries which
are filled with her striving,</i>

260
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,125
<i>and the grandeur of her
successes & her failures.</i>

261
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,000
<i>Through good and ill fortunes alike...</i>

262
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:13,542
<i>she has never lost
sight of that quest...</i>

263
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:17,458
<i>or forgotten the ideals
which gave her strength.</i>

264
00:23:17,833 --> 00:23:21,375
<i>We end today a period of ill fortunes...</i>

265
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,583
<i>and India discovers herself again.</i>

266
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,625
Here.

267
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,917
For Bnuchki.

268
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:43,958
You shouldn't have.

269
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:46,792
She hasn't even finished
the previous book.

270
00:23:46,917 --> 00:23:48,500
<i>'Kings & Queens of Rajasthan'</i>

271
00:23:48,792 --> 00:23:51,000
Then, these sweets & fireworks.

272
00:23:51,292 --> 00:23:52,708
Why spend so much?

273
00:23:52,958 --> 00:23:54,750
Don't worry.

274
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:56,417
What do you think?

275
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:58,875
This comes from my tuition fees?

276
00:24:00,875 --> 00:24:03,708
The party has a fund for social work.

277
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,458
Begum Jaan...

278
00:24:11,667 --> 00:24:13,375
today our country
gained Independence.

279
00:24:13,542 --> 00:24:15,708
Why so glum?

280
00:24:15,792 --> 00:24:18,583
Holidays aren't good for business.

281
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,583
Not a single customer
since morning.

282
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,500
Wealthy men spend such
days with their families.

283
00:24:27,708 --> 00:24:29,167
Not at brothels.

284
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,333
Only drunk farmers and savages.

285
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:34,375
They vomit on the beds, fight...

286
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,417
and they leave without paying.

287
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,250
And the police are the worst.

288
00:24:41,917 --> 00:24:44,375
Begum Jaan, Independence!

289
00:24:45,208 --> 00:24:49,042
After 200 years we are
independent of British rule.

290
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:54,250
On such an occassion-
All the same for a whore.

291
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:58,958
Fair, dark, brown or yellow, they're
all the same in darkness.

292
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:02,375
Hindu, Muslim, high caste, low caste.

293
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,917
It's all the same here.

294
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:07,667
This is like a country where-

295
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,417
Hey! Hey!

296
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,583
Hey you crazy bitch!

297
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,208
Why? Why?

298
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,583
Do you want to burn your face?

299
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:18,917
Tell me!

300
00:25:19,458 --> 00:25:21,000
Who'll take you then?

301
00:25:21,167 --> 00:25:22,958
You'll become a parasite.

302
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,750
I'll throw you out bitch!

303
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:28,125
Begum, let it be. Don't
scold her anymore.

304
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:31,292
Come with me.
- You are spoiling them!

305
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,250
Oh my!

306
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,625
What temper!

307
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:38,458
Shouldn't we get to
have some fun?

308
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,375
Fun doesn't feed.
You low caste bitch!

309
00:25:40,417 --> 00:25:45,542
Don't talk about castes. I'm
of a lower caste then her.

310
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:48,250
But even I get angry.

311
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:08,625
You should leave now, Professor.
And don't bring gifts anymore.

312
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:11,458
We don't take favours.
We pay back to the last penny.

313
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:16,208
If not money then our bodies-
Why are you saying these things?

314
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,167
I come here...

315
00:26:20,792 --> 00:26:22,042
for the country-

316
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:24,000
Let the country burn in Hell!

317
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,500
Hindu, Muslim or British,
this is a country for men!

318
00:26:26,625 --> 00:26:27,875
How does it matter?

319
00:26:27,958 --> 00:26:31,333
If you have the guts then
marry one of these girls.

320
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,125
How did marriage come
in to all of this?

321
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,458
Begum Jaan!

322
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,750
Begum Jaan?

323
00:26:44,042 --> 00:26:45,042
Go!

324
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:46,000
Go for it!

325
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,542
Lazy slut! Just look at him.

326
00:26:52,750 --> 00:27:00,208
<i>How amusing it is, my friend</i>

327
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:07,542
<i>As you accompany Lord Krishna</i>

328
00:27:08,042 --> 00:27:13,333
<i>His love moistens your body</i>

329
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:21,917
<i>As you accompany Lord Krishna</i>

330
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:27,208
<i>As you accompany Lord Krishna</i>

331
00:27:27,375 --> 00:27:31,125
<i>His love moistens your body</i>

332
00:27:31,167 --> 00:27:35,833
<i>How amusing it is, my friend</i>

333
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:44,167
<i>How amusing it is, my friend</i>

334
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,250
What are you doing?

335
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,833
Please don't.

336
00:27:57,667 --> 00:27:59,083
Just go!

337
00:27:59,583 --> 00:28:00,583
Get out!

338
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:07,667
Look, look.

339
00:28:08,792 --> 00:28:10,292
Professor?

340
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,292
Did you understand?

341
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:16,042
All Begum Jaan is saying is that...

342
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,250
our hearts are as
valuable as our bodies.

343
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,375
More valuable than...

344
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:24,333
sweets and fireworks.

345
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:29,000
But I think you can afford it.

346
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,250
Well, gentlemen,

347
00:28:32,542 --> 00:28:34,250
shall we resume?

348
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:35,625
Yes.

349
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:36,667
Yes.

350
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:40,250
Now for the award of the
Bengal Boundary Commission.

351
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,083
And we sincerely hope...

352
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:45,125
we don't have a North-West Frontier
Province kind of a situation.

353
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,958
No, sir.

354
00:28:47,375 --> 00:28:49,792
It's far more complicated than that.

355
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:51,833
It would be much simpler...

356
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:53,708
if we could follow...

357
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:55,833
the principles of contiguity...

358
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,292
as proposed by our party.

359
00:28:58,417 --> 00:28:59,208
And even simpler...

360
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:02,333
if we award the entire province
of Bengal to Pakistan.

361
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,333
Now, now gentlemen, let's not deviate.

362
00:29:05,542 --> 00:29:06,417
The line.

363
00:29:06,542 --> 00:29:13,125
<i>Oh Father!</i>

364
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:19,375
<i>I am having to leave home.</i>

365
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:23,041
<i>Oh Father!</i>

366
00:29:23,042 --> 00:29:24,750
That is how the line...

367
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,750
after going through Dinajpur...

368
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:30,958
will pass through the entirely Muslim
dominated district of Malda.

369
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,916
The line shall then turn South-East...

370
00:29:32,917 --> 00:29:33,000
The line shall then turn South-East...

371
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,500
down the river Ganges...

372
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:37,708
along the boundaries between
the districts of...

373
00:29:37,917 --> 00:29:40,208
Malda and Murshidabad and...

374
00:29:40,417 --> 00:29:42,250
Rajshahi and Nadia.

375
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,875
To the point in the North-Western corner...

376
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,542
of the district of Nadia...

377
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:49,833
where the channel of
the river Mathabhanga...

378
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:52,667
takes off from the river Ganges.

379
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:58,917
<i>Your courtyard is like a mountain,</i>

380
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:05,208
<i>And the threshhold,
a foreign country.</i>

381
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:11,333
<i>Your courtyard is like a mountain,</i>

382
00:30:11,792 --> 00:30:12,708
Sir?

383
00:30:12,792 --> 00:30:14,375
Mr. Ilias is here.

384
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,083
Bring him in.

385
00:30:28,542 --> 00:30:29,667
So?

386
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,750
How are you?

387
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,417
Exactly how you all have kept us.

388
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,583
You all?

389
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:39,042
Oh.

390
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,250
Wow!

391
00:30:43,333 --> 00:30:45,417
What else?

392
00:30:45,917 --> 00:30:49,792
Mr.Suhrawardy's communally
inciting speech in August,

393
00:30:49,917 --> 00:30:51,750
still haunts me.

394
00:30:55,292 --> 00:30:56,958
How's your mother?

395
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,750
Kusum?
- Good.

396
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,375
Both of them.

397
00:31:02,542 --> 00:31:05,083
Both narrowly escaped being raped.

398
00:31:30,167 --> 00:31:31,625
Sorry Ili.

399
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:38,083
How are you?

400
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,875
Your wife Nazia?

401
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,042
She's not well.

402
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:53,083
She's dead, actually.

403
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,625
First she was raped.

404
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:05,208
Then set on fire.

405
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,042
Mom! Oh Mom!

406
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:22,750
Move! Mom!

407
00:32:23,167 --> 00:32:25,417
Come let's play.

408
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:28,333
I can't play now.
Go play with Banno.

409
00:32:28,417 --> 00:32:33,208
No! I want to play with you.

410
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:34,750
Oh God!

411
00:32:34,958 --> 00:32:36,750
Tantrums during business hours!

412
00:32:36,958 --> 00:32:39,542
Let go! Grandma
take care of her.

413
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,667
My darling girl...

414
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,708
We have so many stories to read.

415
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:46,417
The tales of Hambir, Rana Pratap,
Padmini (Kings & Queens)-

416
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,542
I don't want to hear any stories!

417
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:52,000
I don't like stories where
I can't ask questions!

418
00:32:52,042 --> 00:32:54,167
Let's go play.

419
00:32:54,667 --> 00:32:55,417
Hey kid!

420
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:56,458
Listen up.

421
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,333
Let's go picking wild figs.

422
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,542
Come with me.

423
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:01,250
Koli, take care of her.

424
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:06,000
Want to see baby pythons?

425
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:08,583
I don't want to go anywhere!

426
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:10,792
Just go. I'll take care of her.

427
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:13,458
Don't cry...

428
00:33:13,833 --> 00:33:15,375
I think I'll leave.

429
00:33:15,542 --> 00:33:17,333
Could I have my money back?
- Wait, don't go.

430
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:18,833
Hey! You son of a bitch!

431
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:21,125
Can't you see that a mother is
talking to her child?

432
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,083
Why're you creating a ruckus?

433
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,583
I was just saying-

434
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:25,917
What were you saying?

435
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,375
Are you getting late?
Come to my room.

436
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,500
Hey! You sleazy slut!

437
00:33:31,708 --> 00:33:34,333
I've warned you not to
steal my customers!

438
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,250
Get lost!

439
00:33:36,792 --> 00:33:38,917
Mom...

440
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:41,000
Listen to me.

441
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,833
Play with Banno now.

442
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:44,417
I'll join you later.

443
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:47,792
No! I want to play with you!

444
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:50,000
Just stop it!

445
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,417
Begum Jaan will be here
any moment now!

446
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:54,417
Why force her?

447
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,292
Hey you bloody bugger!

448
00:33:56,542 --> 00:33:58,833
Is this a brothel or
a playground?

449
00:33:58,917 --> 00:34:03,042
You won't get a single penny
back! Just get lost!

450
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,792
But I didn't even touch her.

451
00:34:05,042 --> 00:34:06,875
What is happening here?

452
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,083
Koli, Duli and Lata...

453
00:34:12,208 --> 00:34:14,208
We have customers from Goalpara.

454
00:34:14,292 --> 00:34:16,042
See what they need.

455
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:18,917
Banno, Golap should
be done by now.

456
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:21,042
Check if the room is empty.

457
00:34:21,208 --> 00:34:23,333
Rubina, call Sujan.

458
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,958
Ask him to perform his act.

459
00:34:26,583 --> 00:34:27,667
And Grandma...

460
00:34:27,708 --> 00:34:30,458
please step inside.

461
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:35,042
Juthika...
Why can't I play with Mom?

462
00:34:35,167 --> 00:34:37,333
More questions!

463
00:34:39,792 --> 00:34:41,667
You see this uncle here?

464
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:45,750
Your mother has very important
business with him now.

465
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,292
And I have promised that...

466
00:34:48,542 --> 00:34:51,292
they shall not be disturbed.

467
00:34:51,583 --> 00:34:56,667
If you play now, I shall
be proved a liar.

468
00:34:56,958 --> 00:35:01,042
Would you want that?

469
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:08,458
Rubina! Call Sujan & Shabnam.

470
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:33,375
All well at office?

471
00:35:34,083 --> 00:35:37,375
I had no idea.

472
00:35:39,083 --> 00:35:41,125
I saw it all.

473
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,625
One by one, they-
Betel leaf!

474
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:47,750
Still spits out betel leaf.

475
00:35:48,125 --> 00:35:50,917
Same old Mr. Shyam-

476
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,042
What about Mr. Johnson?

477
00:35:56,708 --> 00:36:00,792
Sorry, Ili.

478
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:08,917
You were allergic to
gulal (coloured powder).

479
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,417
You'd never play Holi.

480
00:36:12,917 --> 00:36:14,417
But we would.

481
00:36:14,667 --> 00:36:17,583
And you'd sneak in to
eat Halim and beef.

482
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,208
Right?

483
00:36:21,542 --> 00:36:24,875
That was a long time ago.

484
00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:32,875
I don't think our relationship-
Fine!

485
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:39,333
No one will know that we
were friends or colleagues.

486
00:36:39,667 --> 00:36:42,708
We shall remain 'enemies'.

487
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:47,542
People would know
us as members of...

488
00:36:47,667 --> 00:36:51,667
the Congress & the Muslim League.

489
00:36:52,792 --> 00:36:54,708
We shall do our work.

490
00:36:54,917 --> 00:36:57,500
Then leave.

491
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,917
We'll never meet again.

492
00:37:01,208 --> 00:37:04,167
There's just one problem.

493
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:07,708
The roots go so deep...

494
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,083
that-
Don't worry.

495
00:37:11,208 --> 00:37:13,125
Believe me...

496
00:37:13,583 --> 00:37:17,167
it's easy for you to hate me now.

497
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:20,000
And of course, vice-versa.

498
00:37:20,375 --> 00:37:24,792
Just recollect the atrocities.

499
00:37:25,792 --> 00:37:28,292
Have you studied the plan?

500
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:29,667
Yes.

501
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:32,708
It's a little complicated.

502
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:37,125
There's a lot of barren land.
But that's alright.

503
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,208
I took a preliminary tour.

504
00:37:40,542 --> 00:37:42,125
There'll be a jungle.

505
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:47,125
Let's go. The officers from
Haldibari and Debiganj are waiting.

506
00:37:50,333 --> 00:37:52,542
Which side are we on?

507
00:37:52,917 --> 00:37:56,292
India!

508
00:37:56,833 --> 00:38:00,167
According to Mr.Radcliffe's line...

509
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,458
the border check post will be...

510
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:06,667
in between Haldibari
& Debiganj town.

511
00:38:06,708 --> 00:38:09,458
The barbed-wire fence
will be put up there.

512
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,542
Along the Radcliffe line.

513
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:15,708
That is how the Indo-Pak
border will be determined.

514
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:20,750
We need your help in setting
up the fence & check post.

515
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:27,042
Will there be riots like in
Delhi, Amritsar & Lahore?

516
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,500
Possibly.

517
00:38:28,542 --> 00:38:30,667
But the Muslim League won't
take that responsibility.

518
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:33,708
So the townspeople should
cross over now.

519
00:38:33,792 --> 00:38:36,917
Because soon they will need a permit.

520
00:38:37,958 --> 00:38:39,875
There'll be riots.

521
00:38:40,208 --> 00:38:42,792
Mass murder of the minority.

522
00:38:43,792 --> 00:38:46,708
Men shall become animals.

523
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:02,875
Now a monkey.

524
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,750
Now a tiger!

525
00:39:22,333 --> 00:39:24,333
Let's have an elephant.

526
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:26,958
Like the one here.

527
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,917
Who are you calling an elephant?

528
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,958
Have you seen yourself?

529
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:42,625
According to Mr.Radcliffe's line...

530
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:47,708
that is where the border will pass.

531
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:52,458
Through that jungle, Mr.Akhtar.

532
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:59,750
The fence will bend like a river, Rangpur
and this side will be India.

533
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:02,042
Whose last station will be Haldibari.

534
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:03,833
And the other side is Pakistan.

535
00:40:03,958 --> 00:40:05,875
First station will be Debiganj.

536
00:40:06,042 --> 00:40:07,792
In the middle...

537
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:11,333
there will be border check posts...

538
00:40:12,167 --> 00:40:13,542
What's that?

539
00:40:14,417 --> 00:40:17,292
See that, Mr.Sen?

540
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,250
What's that Shashi?

541
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:28,583
You find these establishments
around town borders...

542
00:40:28,875 --> 00:40:30,458
A Dargah?

543
00:40:30,708 --> 00:40:32,125
Oh no!

544
00:40:32,417 --> 00:40:35,917
It's a brothel. Begum Jaan's brothel.

545
00:40:37,208 --> 00:40:39,792
We'll have to take
down the building.

546
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,333
Because Mr.Radcliffe's border
will pass through it.

547
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,667
And it is very likely that...

548
00:40:45,958 --> 00:40:49,292
check posts will
be placed there.

549
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:55,000
Can't we bypass it?

550
00:40:55,208 --> 00:40:57,917
We have to inspect the place.

551
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:01,375
But why're you so scared?

552
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:05,583
Hold on Mr.Akhtar. Let me explain.

553
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:09,708
Begum Jaan, the woman
who runs the place...

554
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,792
is a total terror.

555
00:41:12,958 --> 00:41:16,042
Loud-mouthed and heavy-handed.

556
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:19,000
She has very influential customers.

557
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:21,792
Nawabs, sahibs, landlords...

558
00:41:21,917 --> 00:41:25,625
So she doesn't care for the law.

559
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,875
Be careful. Take my hand.

560
00:41:29,292 --> 00:41:32,042
Where is she from?

561
00:41:32,125 --> 00:41:34,333
No one knows her real name.

562
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:39,417
But I've heard that she's a local.

563
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:41,708
She went to Varanasi after marriage.

564
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,958
But was soon widowed as a child.

565
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:46,167
And the rest is history.

566
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:50,000
She was sold to a brothel.

567
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,958
She then escaped to Lucknow.

568
00:41:53,042 --> 00:41:56,292
Where she made it big as a courtesan.

569
00:41:57,167 --> 00:42:02,333
After some years, she returned.

570
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:06,250
And opened her brothel
between the towns.

571
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:10,917
She is protected by the
Nawab of Rangpur.

572
00:42:11,083 --> 00:42:14,958
Hence, could pull this off.

573
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:40,333
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

574
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:51,042
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

575
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:58,542
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

576
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:07,083
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

577
00:43:08,917 --> 00:43:15,625
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

578
00:43:35,292 --> 00:43:43,292
<i>Alas! The heart can't accept...</i>

579
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:54,667
<i>Alas! The heart can't accept...</i>

580
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:04,292
<i>that when the night is done</i>

581
00:44:04,542 --> 00:44:12,542
<i>My beloved doesn't recognize me</i>

582
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:18,708
<i>Alas!</i>

583
00:44:19,208 --> 00:44:21,167
<i>Alas!</i>

584
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:25,417
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

585
00:44:39,625 --> 00:44:44,583
<i>This time when you leave</i>

586
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:50,875
<i>Do wake me up</i>

587
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:56,625
<i>So that the empty bed beside me</i>

588
00:44:57,125 --> 00:45:02,208
<i>Doesn't cause me heartburn</i>

589
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,833
<i>Don't want to drape myself
with the stole of sorrow</i>

590
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:12,458
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

591
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:20,333
<i>that when the night is done</i>

592
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:28,583
<i>My beloved doesn't recognize me</i>

593
00:45:32,167 --> 00:45:35,750
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

594
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:40,167
<i>Alas!</i>

595
00:45:41,042 --> 00:45:43,000
<i>Alas!</i>

596
00:45:44,083 --> 00:45:47,542
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

597
00:45:48,625 --> 00:45:51,292
<i>On a silent evening,</i>

598
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:56,083
<i>Pushpabati could hear the sound
of hooves on the mountain.</i>

599
00:45:56,375 --> 00:45:59,125
<i>Sometimes the songs of an old Jat,</i>

600
00:45:59,375 --> 00:46:02,083
<i>And the sweet voice of the shepherd,</i>

601
00:46:02,292 --> 00:46:04,750
<i>would blow in the winds.</i>

602
00:46:04,792 --> 00:46:06,958
<i>Then atop the Vindhya mountains,</i>

603
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:09,250
<i>at the temple of
the Goddess Bhavani,</i>

604
00:46:09,417 --> 00:46:12,292
<i>the puja bell would toll.</i>

605
00:46:12,375 --> 00:46:13,833
<i>Then Pushpabati,</i>

606
00:46:14,042 --> 00:46:17,708
<i>would hide the King's
letter in her hair,</i>

607
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:21,583
<i>wear a saree &
worship the Goddess.</i>

608
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,292
<i>In her heart,</i>

609
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:27,375
<i>she'd pray for the King.</i>

610
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,583
Who's our Goddess?

611
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:32,583
Who do we pray to?

612
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:56,500
<i>All my friends have forsaken me</i>

613
00:47:00,208 --> 00:47:08,208
<i>Now my eyes will remain
lonely for an eternity</i>

614
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:19,917
<i>All my friends have forsaken me</i>

615
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:31,583
<i>Now my eyes will remain
lonely for an eternity</i>

616
00:47:35,333 --> 00:47:43,333
<i>Finally have reconciled to
the separation from my beloved</i>

617
00:47:47,042 --> 00:47:55,042
<i>Am a stranger to myself,
have antagonized the world</i>

618
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:04,500
<i>At an age when sunshine dims</i>

619
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:08,125
<i>The heart can't accept...</i>

620
00:48:08,126 --> 00:48:11,250
I have some bad news, Mr.Akhtar.

621
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,625
According to the map the Radcliffe line
passes right through this house.

622
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,167
Oh God!

623
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,875
So you're saying that one half
of this house is in India,

624
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,917
& the other in Pakistan.

625
00:48:24,083 --> 00:48:27,792
Seems like the British have played
tic-tac-toe with the Partition.

626
00:48:28,333 --> 00:48:31,417
I'm sure they thought through it.

627
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:34,792
So what do we do now?

628
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:37,208
Evict them. Destroy the house.

629
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:40,042
Can't put a barbed fence
through a courtyard.

630
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,500
Or border check posts beside it.

631
00:48:42,625 --> 00:48:44,667
True.

632
00:48:44,875 --> 00:48:48,333
The military as neighbours would be-

633
00:48:50,833 --> 00:48:52,583
How do we...

634
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:54,292
Proper paperwork.

635
00:48:54,417 --> 00:48:57,125
Eviction notice, govt. officials...

636
00:48:57,333 --> 00:48:59,208
It can't be a sudden invasion.

637
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:00,875
Let's call it a day.

638
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:07,125
We've to return soon. The fence
work will start next month.

639
00:49:11,375 --> 00:49:14,000
Will you go or not?

640
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,208
I won't.

641
00:49:18,042 --> 00:49:19,917
Are you sure?

642
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,375
Didn't I say I wouldn't?

643
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:27,208
Fine. Don't have to.

644
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:33,042
Hey!

645
00:49:33,958 --> 00:49:36,583
Please let's go.

646
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:39,500
Where to?

647
00:49:41,167 --> 00:49:43,042
This is our home.

648
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,750
This is all we have.

649
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,125
Don't you want a family,
far away from here?

650
00:49:53,208 --> 00:49:55,458
A family?

651
00:49:57,250 --> 00:50:01,875
My family is here.

652
00:50:07,917 --> 00:50:10,125
I don't like it!

653
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:12,250
What?

654
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:15,958
Those men who visit
you at night.

655
00:50:16,042 --> 00:50:18,958
And then... I hate it!

656
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:20,750
You bring them to me.

657
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:23,167
I know! But what can I do?

658
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:27,917
I owe Begum Jaan too much.

659
00:50:28,208 --> 00:50:30,625
Obligations.

660
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:33,375
Have to do something...

661
00:50:33,875 --> 00:50:36,750
Can't a pimp fall in love?

662
00:50:37,042 --> 00:50:39,000
What did you say?

663
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:41,250
What can't happen?

664
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:42,667
Tell me.

665
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:43,417
Nothing.

666
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,417
Tell me!

667
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,167
Love.

668
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,167
What is so funny?

669
00:50:53,792 --> 00:50:56,542
Come on, now in English.

670
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,375
Please.

671
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:58,875
No, I can't.

672
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,792
Please.

673
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,375
Say it.

674
00:51:02,792 --> 00:51:03,875
Say it!

675
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:09,292
I love you.

676
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:38,917
Hey Sujan!

677
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:40,417
What's the matter?

678
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:44,167
Why are you crying
like a little girl?

679
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:49,375
Let me go!
- I won't.

680
00:51:49,917 --> 00:51:51,500
What happened?
- Let me go!

681
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,250
What happened?
- Let me go, you witch!

682
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:56,375
Let me go!

683
00:51:56,708 --> 00:52:00,333
Let me go, you bloody bitch!

684
00:52:01,042 --> 00:52:04,542
People come and enjoy
my wife every night.

685
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:11,125
Feel like slaughtering them!

686
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,875
Hey!

687
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:29,167
Do you know what this is?

688
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:32,958
Breasts.

689
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:35,500
Flesh.

690
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,708
With which mothers
feed their children.

691
00:52:43,042 --> 00:52:46,083
Do you know what this is?

692
00:52:46,667 --> 00:52:48,500
Vagina.

693
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,750
Like the forehead,

694
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:55,750
elbow, nose, ear, neck,

695
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,042
just another body part.

696
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,417
It's skin.

697
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:08,167
Just skin.

698
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:13,042
Skin of various hues.

699
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:36,125
And do you know what this is?

700
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:43,167
This is your Rubina.

701
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:50,958
Only this.

702
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:56,167
Everything else is...

703
00:53:58,292 --> 00:54:02,958
Like Grandma says...

704
00:54:04,167 --> 00:54:07,917
written in the Gita,
your holy text.

705
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,333
Old clothes.

706
00:54:11,625 --> 00:54:14,875
Which we change everyday.

707
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,167
A storm is brewing.

708
00:54:43,208 --> 00:54:44,708
Let's go.

709
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,917
Let's go.
- Not today.

710
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:02,875
Stomach ache.

711
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:05,333
Begum Jaan-
Hey!

712
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,250
Didn't I say my
stomach's aching?

713
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:09,417
Can't I have an upset tummy?

714
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:12,750
Drag me & everything comes out.

715
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,708
Golap!

716
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:18,458
Go inside. Don't
be stubborn.

717
00:55:26,125 --> 00:55:29,833
Didn't you hear me?

718
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:33,417
Move it. I've taken
the payment.

719
00:55:34,708 --> 00:55:36,167
Bloody bastard!

720
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:40,083
I'm very ill.

721
00:55:40,208 --> 00:55:43,833
Please let it be for today.

722
00:55:44,042 --> 00:55:50,042
Feeling feverish.

723
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:52,458
Same old excuse.

724
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:55,375
Don't piss me off during
business hours!

725
00:55:55,458 --> 00:55:57,792
I know you're lying!

726
00:55:57,958 --> 00:56:01,542
Waiting to flirt with the
Professor, when he comes.

727
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:04,333
Will not tolerate
this nonsense here-

728
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:06,125
Why?

729
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:09,000
Want to keep Professor for yourself?

730
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:13,333
Excuse me, Begum Jaan.
Some officers are here.

731
00:56:13,542 --> 00:56:16,458
With a government order.

732
00:56:21,792 --> 00:56:23,542
Aunt Rubina!

733
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,417
Aunt Rubina!

734
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:27,292
What's happened?

735
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,083
Come fast! It's the police!

736
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:30,917
Greetings, Begum Jaan.

737
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,917
All ok?

738
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:37,417
Greetings.

739
00:56:37,792 --> 00:56:39,125
All was ok.

740
00:56:39,375 --> 00:56:41,083
Till I saw your face.

741
00:56:41,417 --> 00:56:42,500
I see.

742
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:47,250
You have more important
faces to meet today.

743
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:51,583
Please take these
dogs away, Mirza.

744
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:54,625
Make sure they don't
enter the house.

745
00:56:54,708 --> 00:56:56,708
Sure, Begum Jaan.

746
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,417
So...

747
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:04,833
What's the issue?

748
00:57:04,917 --> 00:57:07,125
Actually we had come to-

749
00:57:07,167 --> 00:57:12,292
Remember what happened the last
time you asked for free service.

750
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:16,000
Please don't embarass me.

751
00:57:16,083 --> 00:57:18,583
We've come for something else.

752
00:57:18,708 --> 00:57:20,667
Duped new fry, is it?

753
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:22,708
For heaven's sake!

754
00:57:22,833 --> 00:57:25,625
Mind your language.

755
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:29,333
These gentlemen are important
officers from India & Pakistan.

756
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,083
They have a government order.

757
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:33,167
Not again!

758
00:57:33,542 --> 00:57:36,708
We won't go to the
camps to get examined.

759
00:57:37,042 --> 00:57:38,958
Syphillis is a double-edged sword.

760
00:57:39,042 --> 00:57:41,333
Can't service the sahibs for free.

761
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,875
We...

762
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,833
haven't come for that.

763
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:50,042
We're here with an
eviction notice.

764
00:57:58,292 --> 00:57:59,833
What notice?

765
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:01,250
Let me explain.

766
00:58:01,375 --> 00:58:03,333
You need to vacate the house.

767
00:58:04,417 --> 00:58:09,167
Border check posts will
be built on this land.

768
00:58:09,458 --> 00:58:15,625
And the Indo-Pak border will
pass through this house.

769
00:58:37,125 --> 00:58:39,583
Hey girl, open the door.
It's the police!

770
00:58:40,042 --> 00:58:41,583
If it's a raid, don't worry.

771
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:46,875
A handjob to Shashi
and things will be ok.

772
00:58:47,417 --> 00:58:48,458
Nothing will happen.

773
00:58:48,917 --> 00:58:51,249
Bitch, just open the door.

774
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,417
Hold on, bitch!
Move!

775
00:58:53,208 --> 00:58:55,208
What happened, bitch?

776
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:59,417
Some assholes are here saying
we need to vacate this place.

777
00:58:59,708 --> 00:59:02,292
Is it that easy, huh?

778
00:59:02,917 --> 00:59:04,500
Are you mad?

779
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:09,292
Come, let's see who does what.
We'll hack them to pieces.

780
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:11,792
We'll kill them all, come.

781
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:17,250
The two pieces of paper you are seeing...

782
00:59:18,042 --> 00:59:19,917
These are government notices.

783
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,625
One from Karachi and one from Delhi.

784
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,042
Few months ago...

785
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,792
a law was passed called
'Boundary Commission Act'.

786
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,292
As a result of which a border
between India & Pakistan-

787
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:33,750
International.

788
00:59:33,833 --> 00:59:36,167
An International border
has been created.

789
00:59:37,042 --> 00:59:38,333
As per which...

790
00:59:38,417 --> 00:59:40,875
we're here to set up
the barbed wire fence.

791
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:44,500
And unfortunately...

792
00:59:44,667 --> 00:59:51,000
the Radcliffe line passes
through your house.

793
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:53,792
So see, if we have to...

794
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:56,958
set up a barbed wire fence, we
will need to destroy this house.

795
00:59:57,167 --> 00:59:58,458
So if you could-

796
00:59:58,625 --> 00:59:59,917
Wait, wait!

797
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:01,375
What is it?

798
01:00:04,542 --> 01:00:07,167
So what you're saying is...

799
01:00:07,458 --> 01:00:12,667
that those who are standing on
that side of the courtyard,

800
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:17,708
are standing in India.

801
01:00:19,667 --> 01:00:24,833
And those standing on this side,

802
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,583
are standing in Pakistan?

803
01:00:30,667 --> 01:00:31,958
Yes.

804
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:33,042
Huh?

805
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:34,333
Yes!

806
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,583
It would be best, if you
read the notice yourself.

807
01:00:38,792 --> 01:00:41,208
It's impossible to explain it all.

808
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:45,000
It's self-explanatory.

809
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:51,458
Better if you see it for yourself.

810
01:00:51,542 --> 01:00:54,000
Then you'll understand.

811
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:56,500
Can you read?

812
01:00:57,500 --> 01:01:00,250
Should I read it for you?

813
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,000
Should I?

814
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,625
Unbelievable!

815
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,208
Take a look.

816
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:31,333
A line through the middle!
We're here, they're there!

817
01:01:36,458 --> 01:01:38,625
What's so funny?

818
01:01:47,208 --> 01:01:51,417
Sahib, your Radcliffe seems
to be quite a weirdo.

819
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:56,042
If he had to hack the
country like a butcher,

820
01:01:56,167 --> 01:01:59,500
couldn't he have done a better job?

821
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:01,708
I think we-

822
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:07,167
Rubina, our butcher Rahim
is definitely better.

823
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,434
Ask for the leg, he'll
give you just that.

824
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:16,417
The exact kidney. The precise liver.

825
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:25,000
Not this amateurish,
half-baked division-

826
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:28,583
I don't think you
understand the situation.

827
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:31,542
Let me explain.

828
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:36,208
From next week we
start work on the...

829
01:02:36,375 --> 01:02:40,333
fence & check posts
along the Indo-Pak border.

830
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:45,375
Should take around 5 months.

831
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:53,500
And will ask Hindus & Muslims of
2 border towns, Haldibari & Debiganj...

832
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:57,667
to cross the border because...

833
01:02:58,292 --> 01:03:00,458
after the Partition it
is now clear that...

834
01:03:01,125 --> 01:03:05,708
Muslims in India & Hindus
in Pakistan...

835
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:08,875
will be unsafe.

836
01:03:09,167 --> 01:03:15,292
There'll be a migration of
men, baggage & cattle.

837
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:16,833
And...

838
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:20,083
there'll be Hindu-Muslim riots.

839
01:03:21,917 --> 01:03:23,333
So it's advisable-

840
01:03:23,417 --> 01:03:25,333
Have you paid for her?

841
01:03:25,542 --> 01:03:26,333
What?

842
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:27,875
Money!

843
01:03:30,125 --> 01:03:32,958
Yes. The entire amount.

844
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:36,458
Without asking whether she's
a Hindu or a Muslim. Why?

845
01:03:38,417 --> 01:03:42,292
No. But what does
religion have to do-

846
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:45,667
And Mr.Half-Naked,
what is your caste?

847
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,708
I'm a high caste Brahmin.

848
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:55,375
Do you know that the woman you
fucked is a low caste untouchable?

849
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,292
Don't you fear being ostracized?

850
01:03:58,375 --> 01:03:59,417
No... I mean-

851
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,833
Do you know that...

852
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:08,417
I didn't ask them
about their caste either.

853
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:15,125
They chose a girl,
I set the price.

854
01:04:15,292 --> 01:04:17,583
So, what did you gather?

855
01:04:17,750 --> 01:04:19,333
What is there to gather?

856
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:23,125
It's the same in all brothels.

857
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:27,750
My dear sir,

858
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:30,083
what you are calling a brothel...

859
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:34,250
and implying a whore house...

860
01:04:34,958 --> 01:04:37,500
is my country.

861
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,083
My homeland.

862
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:44,042
We don't have
Hindu-Muslims here.

863
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:46,500
No high or low castes.

864
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,042
Here it's our bodies,

865
01:04:50,208 --> 01:04:52,542
so we have the last word.

866
01:04:52,625 --> 01:04:54,625
And our rules stand.

867
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:59,875
I don't know which India or
Pakistan you speak of...

868
01:05:00,125 --> 01:05:03,458
Even the Professor keeps
telling me about...

869
01:05:03,708 --> 01:05:05,708
Congress, Muslim League,

870
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:08,375
Nehru, Jinnah, Karachi, Delhi,

871
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:11,208
Partition, this, that.

872
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:16,125
But all that is nothing more
then gibberish for me.

873
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:22,958
Because who decides what in
Delhi, is irrelevant to me.

874
01:05:24,167 --> 01:05:27,250
Because I know only one place.

875
01:05:27,958 --> 01:05:30,125
This bathroom,

876
01:05:30,417 --> 01:05:32,292
this courtyard,

877
01:05:32,542 --> 01:05:34,250
this house,

878
01:05:34,375 --> 01:05:38,292
these lanes, these
gardens, this country.

879
01:05:39,542 --> 01:05:42,417
Which is there for
thousands of years.

880
01:05:43,625 --> 01:05:47,208
And if anyone tries
to evict us from here,

881
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:55,458
the only 'Partition' to happen will be
that of their limbs from their bodies.

882
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:57,000
How dare you, bitch!

883
01:06:00,792 --> 01:06:03,083
Down! Down!

884
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,625
Down.

885
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:27,417
Salim!

886
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:31,958
Salim.

887
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:34,625
They are guests.

888
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:38,167
Akhtar.

889
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:55,833
Whatever could be communicated
civilly, has been done.

890
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:09,917
Goodbye, Begum Jaan.

891
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:13,583
You have one month.

892
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:16,583
One month!

893
01:08:00,417 --> 01:08:03,250
Independence? I don't want it!

894
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,375
Just imagine their audacity!

895
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:08,625
They're asking Begum
Jaan to vacate her house!

896
01:08:08,792 --> 01:08:10,750
With an ultimatum of one month!

897
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:11,792
The sheer gall!

898
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,833
Calm down.

899
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,708
No one can do anything about it.

900
01:08:17,417 --> 01:08:18,917
The order has come from high up.

901
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,667
Whatever! How dare they?

902
01:08:21,833 --> 01:08:24,667
Giving me a deadline, huh?

903
01:08:24,833 --> 01:08:27,667
Don't you know
people in the Party?

904
01:08:28,625 --> 01:08:31,875
I want those bastards to be
transferred within a month!

905
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,583
Do what it takes!

906
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:39,208
If you need girls, I'll arrange.
If necessary, I'll go myself.

907
01:08:39,292 --> 01:08:42,125
That's not the
answer to everything!

908
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:47,167
It's no use getting
angry with them.

909
01:08:47,833 --> 01:08:50,667
And one of them belongs
to another party.

910
01:08:54,667 --> 01:08:56,375
Anyway...

911
01:08:56,625 --> 01:09:00,667
let me see if I can
manage a stay order...

912
01:09:01,083 --> 01:09:03,167
with provisional relocation-

913
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:05,417
You haven't eaten in a while.

914
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:07,917
And I don't think you
will in some time.

915
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:09,750
So I was saying...

916
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:13,167
Why don't you eat a little now?

917
01:09:25,167 --> 01:09:26,875
Send a telegram to Karachi.

918
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:31,542
The budget needs to increase.

919
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:37,875
Fencing such a large area as
per the map will cost more.

920
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:44,750
And most importantly, the wood
for the border check posts...

921
01:09:46,208 --> 01:09:49,417
Welcome, Mr.Sen.

922
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,000
Thank you.

923
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:54,875
Sorry Mr.Ilias, I'm a little early.

924
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,208
But not an issue, I'll wait.

925
01:09:57,417 --> 01:09:59,333
Fine. I'm nearly done.

926
01:09:59,500 --> 01:10:06,667
Half the wood for the check posts
will be provided by the Indian Government.

927
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:09,250
Make a note of this and file it.
- Yes, sir.

928
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,958
And maintain the accounts.
Please come along.

929
01:12:20,375 --> 01:12:22,167
I'll talk to him.

930
01:12:22,583 --> 01:12:24,792
Of course we need to talk.

931
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:26,875
A government notice isn't enough.

932
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,167
We have to explain.

933
01:12:29,375 --> 01:12:31,167
What's happening with you?

934
01:12:31,292 --> 01:12:33,000
The same.

935
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:36,083
Funds for construction
will come from both sides.

936
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:38,417
I have informed Delhi.

937
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:41,833
For now checking
lists, allocating workers.

938
01:12:42,292 --> 01:12:44,958
More workers are on their way.

939
01:12:45,083 --> 01:12:47,417
I said things might get violent.

940
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,625
There'll be a huge exodus.
And that whore house.

941
01:12:50,750 --> 01:12:55,125
Things will definitely get violent.

942
01:12:56,958 --> 01:12:59,167
Tell me something.

943
01:12:59,292 --> 01:13:03,000
Why will people leave
their ancestral homes?

944
01:13:03,583 --> 01:13:07,917
The order is for a border.
So why should they leave?

945
01:13:08,625 --> 01:13:10,292
Whether it's...

946
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,208
the Cabinet Mission,

947
01:13:12,375 --> 01:13:14,458
The 3rd June Plan,

948
01:13:14,542 --> 01:13:16,833
or a Border Commission meeting.

949
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:21,875
Our leaders never imagined
this level of migration.

950
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:29,583
Do you know how many people in
Punjab were displaced 3 months back?

951
01:13:30,083 --> 01:13:32,208
8 Million.

952
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:34,458
Official figures.

953
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:37,083
8 Million!

954
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:40,792
Don't forget it.

955
01:13:42,083 --> 01:13:47,792
If you explain the reason for
this to the townsfolk, it should suffice.

956
01:13:47,958 --> 01:13:50,583
Will that work?

957
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,167
It most definitely will.

958
01:13:52,458 --> 01:14:00,458
When tales of rioteering Hindus reach
the circumcized buggers of Haldibari-

959
01:14:11,042 --> 01:14:13,875
Circumcized buggers.

960
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:16,625
Islamic zealots.

961
01:14:17,125 --> 01:14:19,167
Muslim fanatics.

962
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:24,833
Yet a plethora of
Tagore-Nazrul concerts.

963
01:14:25,083 --> 01:14:27,625
Bengalis!

964
01:14:30,750 --> 01:14:33,583
Do you remember Uncle Ramen?

965
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:36,708
Mr.Ghosh's neighbour.

966
01:14:39,583 --> 01:14:44,042
You fell for his daughter.
Tutored her.

967
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:46,708
Kusum.

968
01:14:50,083 --> 01:14:53,417
He had come
running to our house.

969
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:56,833
With his daughter.

970
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:02,083
I was too afraid to
open the door.

971
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:07,083
He was hacked to pieces.

972
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:13,167
Kusum was raped by
an entire neighbourhood.

973
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,667
Didn't see it.

974
01:15:17,083 --> 01:15:19,167
But heard it.

975
01:15:20,042 --> 01:15:22,458
Sounded nothing like Nazrul's songs.

976
01:15:23,208 --> 01:15:25,625
Was something else.

977
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,792
Smelt it too.

978
01:15:29,125 --> 01:15:31,958
Smelt nothing like
halim or biriyani.

979
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:34,375
Was something else.

980
01:15:41,542 --> 01:15:44,375
I'm not short of stories either.

981
01:15:44,875 --> 01:15:50,458
But when they were stripping that
night, never imagined your face.

982
01:15:50,667 --> 01:15:51,792
I still don't.

983
01:15:51,875 --> 01:15:55,125
You should. You need to.

984
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:57,958
Imagine my face.

985
01:15:59,542 --> 01:16:03,000
If you're short of
stories, I'll lend you some.

986
01:16:03,042 --> 01:16:05,875
But stay with hatred. Stay angry.

987
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,333
Else you can't pull it off.

988
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:13,333
Ok. I'll request
people to cross over.

989
01:16:13,542 --> 01:16:17,333
If they don't, will incite them.

990
01:16:18,333 --> 01:16:20,500
That's the last option.

991
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:25,792
Because dusty, fly-infested
bodies of refugees...

992
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:34,417
are far better then
burnt & rotten corpses.

993
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:38,375
People must move.

994
01:22:29,458 --> 01:22:34,750
Unbelievable, isn't it? They
threatened me in my own house.

995
01:22:35,042 --> 01:22:40,167
Threatening me is like
threatening Your Highness.

996
01:22:40,917 --> 01:22:42,958
Names?

997
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:47,167
Some Sen & Ilias.

998
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:53,292
Also the police from
Debiganj and Haldibari.

999
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:58,250
They're just rats.

1000
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:05,458
To kill the cats, one
must go to Delhi.

1001
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,458
I'll be going this month.

1002
01:23:09,500 --> 01:23:13,250
Don't worry. No
one will disturb you.

1003
01:23:13,375 --> 01:23:15,917
Thank you.

1004
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:21,042
But don't kill them off in anger.

1005
01:23:21,167 --> 01:23:23,750
An ouster from job is enough.

1006
01:23:25,042 --> 01:23:32,000
And you, Your Highness, are royally
spoiling the girls with gifts.

1007
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:36,500
You shut shop for me for two days

1008
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:41,917
So I also need to do certain things.

1009
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,333
What are you saying?

1010
01:23:44,375 --> 01:23:46,750
This is your house.

1011
01:23:46,833 --> 01:23:51,042
The girls are also your slaves.

1012
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:55,333
So Your Highness, whom should I
send today?

1013
01:23:55,458 --> 01:23:58,292
Should I tell Golap?

1014
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:01,333
Or Rubina?

1015
01:24:02,167 --> 01:24:05,000
Or would you like Lata?

1016
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:11,583
Heard there's a new girl.

1017
01:24:12,083 --> 01:24:15,458
But couldn't see
her on my way in.

1018
01:24:16,750 --> 01:24:18,917
Are you hiding something?

1019
01:24:19,042 --> 01:24:20,875
No, no.

1020
01:24:21,208 --> 01:24:26,250
Actually... that is Shabnam.

1021
01:24:28,375 --> 01:24:33,917
May be she was playing so you didn't...

1022
01:24:34,625 --> 01:24:38,083
A great tragedy befell her, you know.

1023
01:24:39,917 --> 01:24:47,917
That's why her training is incomplete...
She is not ready... uninitiated.

1024
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:56,750
Begum! Begum.

1025
01:24:57,417 --> 01:25:00,958
No one dares to disturb any of you here.

1026
01:25:01,667 --> 01:25:07,250
Soldiers & Britishers don't stay here
for free. I pay your taxes.

1027
01:25:07,625 --> 01:25:12,000
I had only asked for
one thing in return.

1028
01:25:14,417 --> 01:25:17,250
Do you remember?

1029
01:25:19,625 --> 01:25:24,083
The Nawab has the first
right to a new girl.

1030
01:25:26,583 --> 01:25:29,625
Whether she's ripe or not.

1031
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:34,167
Get her ready.

1032
01:25:34,917 --> 01:25:37,750
I need to leave early tomorrow.

1033
01:25:38,042 --> 01:25:40,250
And Begum...

1034
01:25:40,917 --> 01:25:47,458
My gramophone is not working.
So I couldn't get it.

1035
01:25:50,625 --> 01:25:56,125
You are our guardian, Your Highness.
I would still request you...

1036
01:25:58,708 --> 01:26:02,708
- Please don't make me do this...
- Don't waste time, Begum.

1037
01:26:03,708 --> 01:26:06,542
My trip to Delhi will be delayed.

1038
01:26:08,208 --> 01:26:10,667
And you know very well...

1039
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:16,042
Can't get it up without music.

1040
01:26:18,333 --> 01:26:19,708
Go.

1041
01:26:56,958 --> 01:27:04,958
<i>No tender words of love</i>

1042
01:27:06,042 --> 01:27:11,917
<i>Why do the eyes brim over?</i>

1043
01:27:14,833 --> 01:27:22,833
<i>No tender words of love</i>

1044
01:27:24,208 --> 01:27:30,083
<i>Why do the eyes brim over?</i>

1045
01:27:33,125 --> 01:27:41,125
<i>Night hasn't dawned on me for long</i>

1046
01:27:42,125 --> 01:27:49,375
<i>My eyelids get heavy</i>

1047
01:27:53,167 --> 01:28:01,167
<i>Polished myself by embracing you</i>

1048
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:10,500
<i>Polished myself by embracing you</i>

1049
01:28:11,542 --> 01:28:16,667
<i>And desire would shine forth</i>

1050
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:37,333
<i>Every breath communicates</i>

1051
01:28:38,417 --> 01:28:45,957
<i>An unheard narrative</i>

1052
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:47,238
<i>Polished myself by embracing you</i>

1053
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:54,500
<i>Polished myself by embracing you</i>

1054
01:28:55,375 --> 01:29:00,792
<i>The desire would shine forth</i>

1055
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:09,125
<i>Every breath communicates</i>

1056
01:29:09,917 --> 01:29:17,917
<i>An unheard narrative</i>

1057
01:29:19,542 --> 01:29:22,458
Any news?

1058
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:24,583
Bad news.

1059
01:29:24,708 --> 01:29:26,292
We need to talk.

1060
01:29:26,417 --> 01:29:30,583
Go ahead.

1061
01:29:30,917 --> 01:29:33,458
No... Not here.

1062
01:29:33,833 --> 01:29:36,333
It's confidential.

1063
01:29:36,792 --> 01:29:39,542
You are too much.

1064
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:43,708
I have something to say as well.

1065
01:29:43,958 --> 01:29:45,917
Come, play.

1066
01:29:47,667 --> 01:29:50,500
Let me start.

1067
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:54,500
What's wrong?

1068
01:29:54,542 --> 01:29:57,458
I spoke to the Party.

1069
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:59,792
Nothing can be done.

1070
01:29:59,833 --> 01:30:02,667
No influence will work.
- What?

1071
01:30:04,792 --> 01:30:07,500
If this reaches the government,

1072
01:30:07,792 --> 01:30:10,625
everything will be in a mess.

1073
01:30:10,917 --> 01:30:13,000
Before that...

1074
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:17,917
you should vacate this house.

1075
01:30:17,958 --> 01:30:20,083
They have no sympathy.

1076
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:24,458
They flash a government notice-
Which government?

1077
01:30:24,750 --> 01:30:26,542
I govern myself.

1078
01:30:27,083 --> 01:30:31,833
Don't you get it?
Your life is at risk.

1079
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:39,875
This is an opportunity...

1080
01:30:39,917 --> 01:30:43,417
to start afresh.

1081
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:49,083
Leave it all behind.

1082
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:53,625
This house, your business...

1083
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:58,667
We could leave all this-
We?

1084
01:31:01,125 --> 01:31:03,917
Err... Actually...

1085
01:31:05,042 --> 01:31:06,875
Begum Jaan...

1086
01:31:07,792 --> 01:31:10,875
From the very beginning, I...

1087
01:32:02,708 --> 01:32:05,875
Standing with doesn't
imply sleeping with.

1088
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:09,625
I've always-
Helped a lot.

1089
01:32:09,667 --> 01:32:11,667
Thank you for that.

1090
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:15,833
But had I known your ulterior
motives, would've refused it.

1091
01:32:16,125 --> 01:32:19,708
Begum Jaan is beyond your reach.

1092
01:32:20,333 --> 01:32:21,750
I'm truly...

1093
01:32:21,792 --> 01:32:27,625
You know someone is in
love with you! Then why?

1094
01:32:28,417 --> 01:32:31,875
I wanted to tell you-
Hush!

1095
01:32:32,042 --> 01:32:35,292
You were there with
us in good times.

1096
01:32:35,333 --> 01:32:38,500
Don't want to be the reason
for your bad times.

1097
01:32:38,542 --> 01:32:41,292
Don't ever come back.

1098
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:44,250
Sahib?
- Yes.

1099
01:32:44,333 --> 01:32:46,792
Mr.Ilias is here.

1100
01:32:47,583 --> 01:32:49,542
Why so late at night?

1101
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:53,583
He has brought an
injured man along.

1102
01:32:53,875 --> 01:32:56,333
It's confidential.

1103
01:32:56,917 --> 01:32:59,750
You're too much.

1104
01:32:59,875 --> 01:33:04,167
I have something to say as well.

1105
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:07,083
Come, play.

1106
01:33:07,875 --> 01:33:12,167
Let me start.

1107
01:33:12,792 --> 01:33:14,750
What's wrong?

1108
01:33:14,792 --> 01:33:17,917
I spoke to the Party.

1109
01:33:18,042 --> 01:33:20,042
Nothing can be done.

1110
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:24,625
No influence will work.
- What?

1111
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:27,875
If this reaches the government,

1112
01:33:27,958 --> 01:33:30,958
everything will be in a mess.

1113
01:33:31,125 --> 01:33:33,708
Before that...

1114
01:33:33,917 --> 01:33:37,500
you should vacate this house.

1115
01:33:38,625 --> 01:33:41,083
They have no sympathy.

1116
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:44,958
They flash a government notice-
So what?

1117
01:33:45,042 --> 01:33:51,375
Won't you save us?

1118
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,667
I can't do anything!

1119
01:33:58,083 --> 01:34:02,708
I'm alone against many.

1120
01:34:03,625 --> 01:34:10,000
What if we escape?
- We?

1121
01:34:12,333 --> 01:34:14,667
Begum?

1122
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:21,375
That's what I
wanted to tell you.

1123
01:34:53,875 --> 01:34:59,833
I can't.

1124
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:07,000
I can't do this to Golap.

1125
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:10,208
Golap? Unbelievable!

1126
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:16,333
Don't you know
I love you? Then why?

1127
01:35:16,750 --> 01:35:21,000
I never-
Hush!

1128
01:35:21,250 --> 01:35:24,625
You were there with
us in good times.

1129
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:29,000
Don't want to be the reason
for your bad times.

1130
01:35:29,208 --> 01:35:33,792
Don't ever come back.

1131
01:35:35,833 --> 01:35:41,500
Now do you understand
what happened that day?

1132
01:35:42,875 --> 01:35:47,458
I always wanted
you all to be happy.

1133
01:35:49,375 --> 01:35:51,833
Especially you.

1134
01:35:54,375 --> 01:35:58,292
I fought for you all...

1135
01:35:58,792 --> 01:36:02,625
against the villagers.

1136
01:36:03,125 --> 01:36:07,083
Against my own Party.

1137
01:36:07,708 --> 01:36:13,375
Maybe that's why... I've been
exiled from the house.

1138
01:36:19,167 --> 01:36:25,167
I have to sneak
in like a thief...

1139
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:30,583
to meet you.

1140
01:37:09,208 --> 01:37:14,083
I wasn't allowed in
with a government notice.

1141
01:37:14,208 --> 01:37:19,917
I was thrashed when I
went with 4 constables.

1142
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:28,000
The Pathan said, he'd beat
both of you black & blue.

1143
01:37:29,875 --> 01:37:37,875
And then bury you
in their courtyard.

1144
01:37:43,958 --> 01:37:49,000
Construction will stop if they
don't vacate in 10 days.

1145
01:37:49,125 --> 01:37:52,958
I know. My engineers told me.

1146
01:37:53,708 --> 01:37:58,833
The problem is that the
government... You may leave.

1147
01:38:02,250 --> 01:38:05,500
The govt. servants are
too scared to go.

1148
01:38:05,667 --> 01:38:09,583
And the Nawab of
Rangpur protects them.

1149
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:17,750
The Nawab's army
is at her disposal.

1150
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:26,750
It would be a shame to
seek the army's help for this.

1151
01:38:27,542 --> 01:38:29,792
Besides, that's not possible.

1152
01:38:29,875 --> 01:38:34,458
Too many riots and
refugees to handle.

1153
01:38:47,542 --> 01:38:49,625
We need to...

1154
01:38:49,708 --> 01:38:54,542
go to Mekhliganj tomorrow.

1155
01:38:54,833 --> 01:38:56,875
Why?

1156
01:38:57,792 --> 01:39:01,208
For the solution
to this problem.

1157
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:07,042
Not everything can
be done legally.

1158
01:39:07,208 --> 01:39:13,833
Sometimes you need
to go beyond the law.

1159
01:39:17,667 --> 01:39:21,375
Got it, Mr.Ilias?

1160
01:39:21,625 --> 01:39:27,333
For you everything hangs
between your legs! Bastard!

1161
01:39:27,500 --> 01:39:29,667
You're assaulting a policeman.

1162
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:33,667
I came here to help.

1163
01:39:33,750 --> 01:39:37,833
You have to vacate. In case
your girls need any shelter-

1164
01:39:37,917 --> 01:39:41,417
And who decides that?
Does your mother work here?

1165
01:39:41,500 --> 01:39:43,583
You bloody whore!

1166
01:39:47,833 --> 01:39:50,958
You aren't very smart, I see.

1167
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,625
You can't abuse a whore
by calling her one.

1168
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:58,917
Call her a policeman,
and that's an abuse.

1169
01:39:58,958 --> 01:40:00,958
Salim.

1170
01:40:04,083 --> 01:40:05,250
Hey!

1171
01:40:05,750 --> 01:40:10,792
The King protects us.
We don't need rats.

1172
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,542
What can I do for you?

1173
01:40:48,917 --> 01:40:50,792
First the introductions.

1174
01:40:50,875 --> 01:40:52,250
This is...

1175
01:40:53,417 --> 01:40:57,375
Md.Ilias, from the
Pakistani government.

1176
01:40:57,583 --> 01:40:59,917
This is Kabir.

1177
01:40:59,958 --> 01:41:02,917
How do I describe him?

1178
01:41:03,208 --> 01:41:05,250
He is a...

1179
01:41:05,292 --> 01:41:08,208
I run a gang of goons.

1180
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:10,458
Name's Kabir.

1181
01:41:10,542 --> 01:41:12,667
Can be both a Hindu
or a Muslim name.

1182
01:41:12,750 --> 01:41:16,667
I wear a Brahmin string
& am circumsized.

1183
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,625
Have both Hindu scriptures
& Muslim skull caps.

1184
01:41:19,708 --> 01:41:23,625
Never know which side I
may have to take in the riot.

1185
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:26,500
Am ready with both.

1186
01:41:27,792 --> 01:41:29,708
I'm secular.

1187
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:33,000
Pay & use.

1188
01:41:36,167 --> 01:41:38,208
What do you want?

1189
01:41:38,625 --> 01:41:40,625
Don't want a riot.

1190
01:41:41,375 --> 01:41:44,542
There are enough
of those anyway.

1191
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:48,375
Need to vacate a house.

1192
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:52,208
Between Haldibari & Debiganj.

1193
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:56,750
The whorehouse? I hope
your men are done trying.

1194
01:41:56,875 --> 01:41:58,958
Once my boys get in-

1195
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:02,292
Don't worry about that.

1196
01:42:02,583 --> 01:42:04,625
Just do your job.

1197
01:42:04,792 --> 01:42:07,833
And the job description?

1198
01:42:08,083 --> 01:42:11,500
Should we scare
them? Break bones?

1199
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:13,917
Rape them?

1200
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:17,583
Or should we shoot and stab?

1201
01:42:17,917 --> 01:42:21,833
Could also sever
breasts, disembowel...

1202
01:42:22,333 --> 01:42:24,250
Impale them with rods-

1203
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:27,042
The act determines
the fee, right?

1204
01:42:27,125 --> 01:42:29,583
What?
- No, no.

1205
01:42:29,792 --> 01:42:34,167
Money's not an issue.
But don't be brutal.

1206
01:42:34,417 --> 01:42:38,083
Few policemen will
accompany you.

1207
01:42:38,417 --> 01:42:40,375
Scare them first.

1208
01:42:40,500 --> 01:42:43,833
If that doesn't work,
shoot them.

1209
01:42:54,417 --> 01:42:56,875
We need groceries.

1210
01:42:57,042 --> 01:43:00,333
We're running short on supplies.

1211
01:43:00,542 --> 01:43:03,083
It's Lata and Sujan's turn.

1212
01:43:03,792 --> 01:43:05,792
Can't carry so much alone.

1213
01:43:05,833 --> 01:43:07,875
I need some help.

1214
01:43:07,917 --> 01:43:12,625
I'm a vegetarian.
I lack the strength.

1215
01:43:12,792 --> 01:43:18,292
Elephants are vegetarian too.
But they're beasts of burden.

1216
01:43:18,417 --> 01:43:20,958
You forgot the important ones.

1217
01:43:21,042 --> 01:43:24,417
Cows, donkeys and oxes.

1218
01:43:24,583 --> 01:43:27,292
But for her, elephant is apt.

1219
01:43:27,417 --> 01:43:33,333
Coming from someone who used
to clean toilets, that's rich!

1220
01:43:33,417 --> 01:43:37,000
Can we not discuss
toilets while eating?

1221
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,958
Banno!
- Yes!

1222
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:42,042
Get the meat that was
sent from the village.

1223
01:43:42,083 --> 01:43:44,292
Here it is.

1224
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:46,375
I want some gravy.

1225
01:43:46,542 --> 01:43:48,250
Uncle Salim.

1226
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,458
The situation demands...

1227
01:43:52,083 --> 01:43:54,917
that you teach
us how to use guns.

1228
01:43:55,042 --> 01:43:58,792
The guns your friends
had given you...

1229
01:43:58,917 --> 01:44:02,000
are rotting in the corner.

1230
01:44:02,583 --> 01:44:05,000
Begum Jaan, please tell him.

1231
01:44:05,208 --> 01:44:07,708
The Nawab protects us.

1232
01:44:07,875 --> 01:44:11,042
Why should you take up arms?

1233
01:44:11,667 --> 01:44:12,708
Water?

1234
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:15,000
You have mail!
- Jnui, go get it.

1235
01:44:15,167 --> 01:44:17,083
Ok.
- Give me water.

1236
01:44:17,292 --> 01:44:22,917
Why isn't the water
coming this way?

1237
01:44:25,417 --> 01:44:28,583
Go to Hell!
- You go to Hell!

1238
01:44:33,917 --> 01:44:36,708
Have some more.

1239
01:44:39,375 --> 01:44:40,958
When'll you go shopping?

1240
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:44,167
Begum? What happened?

1241
01:44:51,542 --> 01:44:53,542
Golap, read it.

1242
01:44:53,708 --> 01:44:54,708
What is it?

1243
01:44:54,750 --> 01:44:56,458
Golap, what's wrong?

1244
01:44:56,708 --> 01:44:59,042
What's wrong?

1245
01:44:59,292 --> 01:45:02,333
Bloody bastards!

1246
01:45:02,417 --> 01:45:04,292
What happened?

1247
01:45:12,042 --> 01:45:14,458
<i>Good morning, Begum Jaan.</i>

1248
01:45:14,583 --> 01:45:17,833
<i>Wasn't the meat good?</i>

1249
01:45:18,583 --> 01:45:22,500
<i>I knew Shekhu, your dog,
would taste good.</i>

1250
01:45:22,708 --> 01:45:24,875
<i>Salt and spice fine?</i>

1251
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:30,792
<i>I prepared it myself.</i>

1252
01:45:31,250 --> 01:45:34,292
<i>I left Bhalu, your other dog, uncooked.</i>

1253
01:45:34,417 --> 01:45:37,375
<i>You can cook and eat
him at your leisure.</i>

1254
01:45:37,542 --> 01:45:45,542
<i>P.S.- You will have to vacate the house.
Two countries are about to be born.</i>

1255
01:45:47,583 --> 01:45:49,667
<i>Regards, Kabir.</i>

1256
01:45:59,708 --> 01:46:02,458
Uncle Salim!

1257
01:46:03,292 --> 01:46:06,750
Have you gone mad?

1258
01:46:16,417 --> 01:46:22,792
I doubt Kabir will stop at
merely scaring them.

1259
01:46:23,292 --> 01:46:26,375
So what?

1260
01:46:27,667 --> 01:46:30,667
Is your heart wrenching?

1261
01:46:30,708 --> 01:46:33,042
Don't talk like a fool!

1262
01:46:33,083 --> 01:46:38,833
I have convinced more people
to move then you have.

1263
01:46:39,375 --> 01:46:43,375
Partition and exodus are required.

1264
01:46:43,458 --> 01:46:48,167
With you all around,
riots are unavoidable!

1265
01:46:55,458 --> 01:46:58,542
Haven't slept for years.

1266
01:47:01,667 --> 01:47:05,167
I'd wake up in the
middle of the night.

1267
01:47:05,542 --> 01:47:08,208
When I'd hear the sound.

1268
01:47:08,250 --> 01:47:11,500
Or remember their faces.

1269
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:25,667
We could pressurize the Nawab
and take the help of the army-

1270
01:47:25,708 --> 01:47:28,792
Not enough time.

1271
01:47:28,875 --> 01:47:33,583
Riots are on the rise.

1272
01:47:35,208 --> 01:47:37,542
Think of it this way...

1273
01:47:37,708 --> 01:47:43,792
we're killing a few,
to save many.

1274
01:47:45,583 --> 01:47:49,083
Think of it as
Bakr-Id (Festival of sacrifice).

1275
01:47:50,167 --> 01:47:53,292
Bloody cowards!
My helpless babies...

1276
01:47:54,042 --> 01:47:57,542
Promise me you'll skin them!

1277
01:47:57,667 --> 01:48:03,167
And whip them with a whip
made out of that skin.

1278
01:48:03,750 --> 01:48:10,750
What's wrong with your throat?
- Shekhu's fur is in there.

1279
01:48:11,333 --> 01:48:14,500
You're imagining it.

1280
01:48:14,625 --> 01:48:17,125
I'm not.

1281
01:48:17,167 --> 01:48:20,333
It's stuck.

1282
01:48:31,833 --> 01:48:35,042
You will have to leave.

1283
01:48:40,125 --> 01:48:44,083
What?
- Times are changing.

1284
01:48:48,667 --> 01:48:51,417
I had gone to Delhi.

1285
01:48:53,625 --> 01:48:56,375
Everything will be over.

1286
01:49:00,417 --> 01:49:04,542
I don't understand what-

1287
01:49:04,667 --> 01:49:07,708
King of Junagarh had
come to Delhi too.

1288
01:49:07,875 --> 01:49:10,375
Nizam of Hyderabad
had sent a letter.

1289
01:49:10,458 --> 01:49:17,458
Kashmir and Hyderabad have been
asked to choose their country.

1290
01:49:17,958 --> 01:49:22,917
So what? Kings
will remain kings.

1291
01:49:28,167 --> 01:49:31,333
They won't.

1292
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,333
The Subject will be the King.

1293
01:49:33,708 --> 01:49:38,917
Muslim farmers left a cow's
cadaver at the Bhawal palace.

1294
01:49:40,875 --> 01:49:43,708
Delhi and Karachi
have the same plan.

1295
01:49:43,833 --> 01:49:48,375
All the land shall be taken over
by the government very soon.

1296
01:49:48,458 --> 01:49:51,875
What about you all?

1297
01:49:56,667 --> 01:49:59,083
We'll be reduced
to chess pieces.

1298
01:49:59,125 --> 01:50:02,250
The treasury is not
in good shape.

1299
01:50:03,292 --> 01:50:07,292
I'm selling everything I can.

1300
01:50:07,542 --> 01:50:12,042
And then you have court
cases thanks to relatives.

1301
01:50:16,083 --> 01:50:19,333
Listen to the government.

1302
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:22,708
Vacate this house.

1303
01:50:26,208 --> 01:50:30,208
Am powerless now. Can't
protect you anymore.

1304
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:38,375
Salim!

1305
01:50:39,250 --> 01:50:41,542
Salim!

1306
01:50:47,917 --> 01:50:52,875
The Nawab is tired.
Escort him to his room.

1307
01:50:53,125 --> 01:50:56,333
He needs rest.
- Begum!

1308
01:50:58,375 --> 01:51:02,000
He'll be leaving early tomorrow.

1309
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:07,250
Make the arrangements.
- You'll die a gruesome death!

1310
01:51:08,667 --> 01:51:14,500
At least I won't die a beggar.

1311
01:51:15,042 --> 01:51:18,417
I'll die like a queen.
- Make sure you die.

1312
01:51:18,583 --> 01:51:24,292
For they will rape you
first and then kill you.

1313
01:51:24,458 --> 01:51:32,458
Come what may. I won't
need a man to protect us.

1314
01:51:39,667 --> 01:51:42,417
Your enemy stands
in front of you.

1315
01:51:42,542 --> 01:51:45,292
Hold it up!

1316
01:51:47,833 --> 01:51:49,708
One eye closed!

1317
01:51:49,792 --> 01:51:52,917
Aim with your right eye!

1318
01:51:59,417 --> 01:52:01,625
What a recoil!

1319
01:52:08,917 --> 01:52:12,625
I've gone deaf!
- You're fine.

1320
01:52:31,583 --> 01:52:33,083
Begum Jaan!

1321
01:52:33,167 --> 01:52:35,208
Golap, you serpent!

1322
01:52:39,500 --> 01:52:42,250
Ungrateful bitch!

1323
01:52:42,500 --> 01:52:44,250
Get lost!

1324
01:52:58,083 --> 01:53:03,125
Begum Jaan will kill us if she
finds out we got Bnuchki along.

1325
01:53:03,167 --> 01:53:07,042
Why? It was Juthika's idea.

1326
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:10,333
She's stuck at home all day.

1327
01:53:10,833 --> 01:53:15,250
She really misses
Shekhu & Bhalu.

1328
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:06,500
Bnuchki!
- Hurry, Bnuchki!

1329
01:54:10,708 --> 01:54:12,125
This way!

1330
01:54:12,875 --> 01:54:14,875
That way!

1331
01:54:46,542 --> 01:54:53,292
<i>Strange is the bird</i>

1332
01:54:54,583 --> 01:55:00,208
<i>Which flies in and out of the cage</i>

1333
01:55:19,833 --> 01:55:26,292
<i>If I can catch it</i>

1334
01:55:35,292 --> 01:55:40,500
<i>Will chain it with my mind</i>

1335
01:55:44,125 --> 01:55:48,625
<i>How it flies, in and out</i>

1336
01:56:18,708 --> 01:56:24,625
<i>Strange is the bird</i>

1337
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:47,208
Will they kill us?
- Shut up!

1338
01:56:48,167 --> 01:56:50,458
Bastards seem to
have gone that way.

1339
01:56:50,625 --> 01:56:56,250
Let's escape through
the secret exit.

1340
01:56:56,500 --> 01:56:59,625
No. They're coming this way.

1341
01:56:59,958 --> 01:57:01,875
You all slip out.

1342
01:57:02,167 --> 01:57:04,125
Leaving you here alone?
I'd rather die.

1343
01:57:04,250 --> 01:57:06,750
Don't argue.
For my sake, flee!

1344
01:57:06,833 --> 01:57:09,958
Didn't want to come-
Shut up!

1345
01:57:10,042 --> 01:57:13,417
Now what'll happen?
Will they kill us all?

1346
01:57:57,875 --> 01:58:01,208
See! I told you so! Didn't
listen to me as I'm a kid!

1347
01:58:01,667 --> 01:58:03,500
Now they'll kill us!

1348
01:58:03,750 --> 01:58:07,167
Please don't kill me!
Please! Please!

1349
01:58:08,917 --> 01:58:11,667
I'm a little girl!
Please don't kill me!

1350
01:58:12,167 --> 01:58:15,417
For Lord Krishna's sake!
Beg of you, don't kill me!

1351
01:58:15,458 --> 01:58:18,333
Believe me! I'm innocent!

1352
01:58:18,375 --> 01:58:20,917
I beg of you...

1353
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:33,667
I'll really miss you, Sujan.

1354
01:58:37,292 --> 01:58:40,542
But then you won't be there.

1355
01:58:42,417 --> 01:58:45,583
By then you'll be far away.

1356
01:59:51,542 --> 01:59:55,042
Remember that foreigner?

1357
01:59:55,375 --> 01:59:57,708
Margaret White.

1358
01:59:58,583 --> 02:00:03,458
The one who had come to
take photographs for a magazine?

1359
02:00:03,625 --> 02:00:09,292
I think I'll ask her to help.

1360
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:16,667
I want our story in
newspapers across the country.

1361
02:00:17,500 --> 02:00:20,417
Will all this happen?

1362
02:00:20,958 --> 02:00:25,458
Not sure. I know only two things-

1363
02:00:25,875 --> 02:00:32,500
I won't leave this house & won't
go down without a fight!

1364
02:00:35,667 --> 02:00:39,250
Shashi was saying that...

1365
02:00:39,375 --> 02:00:42,542
the pimp's body was found.

1366
02:00:44,583 --> 02:00:47,042
In four pieces.

1367
02:00:50,125 --> 02:00:55,333
Delhi has asked for
a progress report.

1368
02:00:57,083 --> 02:01:04,500
If news of our
illegal procedures,

1369
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:09,042
reach Delhi or Karachi...

1370
02:01:09,292 --> 02:01:11,500
there'll be problems.

1371
02:01:11,625 --> 02:01:13,792
The entire world is watching us.

1372
02:01:13,875 --> 02:01:18,250
The problem will be
solved before it's publicized.

1373
02:01:19,792 --> 02:01:23,333
And believe me, it'll
make no difference.

1374
02:01:23,458 --> 02:01:28,458
100 years later when kids will
study about the Partition...

1375
02:01:28,542 --> 02:01:32,708
they won't read about
us or Begum Jaan.

1376
02:01:32,792 --> 02:01:34,375
I know.

1377
02:01:34,542 --> 02:01:37,917
History is about
kings, not pawns.

1378
02:01:39,167 --> 02:01:42,333
At most knights & rooks.

1379
02:01:42,458 --> 02:01:47,167
But that's 100 years later.
What about now?

1380
02:01:48,542 --> 02:01:53,792
At this moment, I am
the King & I am History!

1381
02:01:54,542 --> 02:01:58,542
And I have morals!
- For now.

1382
02:01:58,625 --> 02:02:01,333
But it won't last.

1383
02:02:01,708 --> 02:02:03,458
I spoke to Kabir-
I can't-

1384
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:07,083
You don't need to do anything.

1385
02:02:07,208 --> 02:02:12,208
In such violent times,
tragedies are common.

1386
02:02:13,458 --> 02:02:15,083
Bring the meat!

1387
02:02:16,750 --> 02:02:22,500
Set up the brothel...
& you all came one by one.

1388
02:02:22,667 --> 02:02:27,458
Made a living.
Business thrived.

1389
02:02:28,792 --> 02:02:32,042
Lata, remember how you...

1390
02:02:32,125 --> 02:02:35,750
escaped from the Hindu priests?

1391
02:02:35,833 --> 02:02:39,625
How you chased
away the Brahmins!

1392
02:02:39,667 --> 02:02:44,083
Banno, you cried while
menstruating for the first time.

1393
02:02:44,125 --> 02:02:45,708
You're embarassing me...

1394
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:50,000
Koli & Duli came when
Muslims set their village ablaze.

1395
02:02:50,083 --> 02:02:53,250
It was a stormy night!

1396
02:02:54,042 --> 02:02:57,208
Both had high fever.

1397
02:02:57,292 --> 02:03:00,000
Both were in delirium.

1398
02:03:00,125 --> 02:03:03,625
Well, they're still delirious.

1399
02:03:03,708 --> 02:03:08,375
Shut up bitch!
Want me to start?

1400
02:03:08,542 --> 02:03:14,291
Poached Lata's customer
for a saree, & I'm delirious?

1401
02:03:14,292 --> 02:03:16,833
Shut up! Lata,
say something.

1402
02:03:16,875 --> 02:03:20,333
The land I was born in,

1403
02:03:20,917 --> 02:03:24,583
which I left after marriage,

1404
02:03:24,750 --> 02:03:28,958
where I returned as a courtesan,

1405
02:03:30,875 --> 02:03:36,500
will now be divided
into two countries.

1406
02:03:38,542 --> 02:03:43,167
The tree which
housed my marbles,

1407
02:03:44,500 --> 02:03:51,375
the earth which houses
my torn doll...

1408
02:04:02,708 --> 02:04:10,708
And this shelter, where
we live with heads held high...

1409
02:04:13,250 --> 02:04:21,250
must be vacated to ensure
independence for two countries.

1410
02:04:28,083 --> 02:04:31,708
You bastards!
Fucking swines!

1411
02:04:31,750 --> 02:04:34,708
I will not relent!

1412
02:04:35,667 --> 02:04:38,583
I don't need any help!

1413
02:04:38,667 --> 02:04:44,583
I can protect my home &
my memories myself!

1414
02:04:44,667 --> 02:04:45,542
Alone!

1415
02:04:45,583 --> 02:04:48,125
But you all should leave.

1416
02:04:48,250 --> 02:04:50,625
Where'll we go?

1417
02:04:50,875 --> 02:04:52,250
Huh?

1418
02:04:52,500 --> 02:04:53,708
And why?

1419
02:04:53,792 --> 02:04:56,958
Go anywhere!
Just leave!

1420
02:04:57,083 --> 02:05:01,583
Those after us are beasts!

1421
02:05:02,708 --> 02:05:07,542
We're prostitutes
opposing the government.

1422
02:05:08,292 --> 02:05:13,292
It's not just our lives but
our self-respect that-

1423
02:05:18,125 --> 02:05:20,250
Self-respect?

1424
02:05:20,375 --> 02:05:23,958
Whores with self-respect?

1425
02:05:30,750 --> 02:05:33,042
You're a woman, Begum Jaan.

1426
02:05:33,500 --> 02:05:36,458
Don't you know that
it doesn't matter...

1427
02:05:36,583 --> 02:05:41,792
whether you're a queen or
whore? It's a man's world here!

1428
02:05:42,250 --> 02:05:45,750
Where will we go?

1429
02:05:47,667 --> 02:05:51,125
Will our families take us back?

1430
02:05:51,792 --> 02:05:53,667
They won't.

1431
02:05:53,833 --> 02:06:01,833
The high-caste Brahmins will curse
during the day & fuck me at night.

1432
02:06:03,458 --> 02:06:10,208
Why don't you understand?
- There's nothing to understand.

1433
02:06:13,833 --> 02:06:19,458
They hacked my Sujan to pieces.

1434
02:06:21,167 --> 02:06:27,583
I won't leave till
I have my revenge.

1435
02:06:28,083 --> 02:06:30,417
Neither will we.

1436
02:06:32,708 --> 02:06:38,458
Begum Jaan, this house
belongs to us as well.

1437
02:06:38,542 --> 02:06:40,958
We all live here.

1438
02:06:41,125 --> 02:06:44,167
We know what awaits us outside.

1439
02:06:44,250 --> 02:06:48,042
We won't leave! We'll
fight to death!

1440
02:06:48,167 --> 02:06:50,750
Please don't make me move.

1441
02:06:50,875 --> 02:06:54,875
Let me wait out my
remaining days here.

1442
02:06:55,125 --> 02:06:59,375
Even in the midst of gun fire.

1443
02:07:06,333 --> 02:07:13,875
But somehow, we need to get
Bnuchki & Shabnam out of here.

1444
02:07:14,417 --> 02:07:17,875
This is no place for
kids. So Jnui-

1445
02:07:17,917 --> 02:07:20,750
No! Please don't
say anything.

1446
02:07:20,917 --> 02:07:26,750
Bnuchki isn't only my daughter!
All of us have raised her.

1447
02:07:26,833 --> 02:07:30,125
Either everyone flees
with her or no one does!

1448
02:07:30,208 --> 02:07:33,375
Why are you so stubborn?

1449
02:07:33,625 --> 02:07:36,417
You...

1450
02:07:37,375 --> 02:07:39,083
Alright.

1451
02:07:39,792 --> 02:07:42,250
Do something...

1452
02:07:45,042 --> 02:07:51,625
Leave them at my uncle's
place in Kishenganj for now.

1453
02:07:52,875 --> 02:07:55,708
Salim.
- Yes.

1454
02:07:57,167 --> 02:08:01,583
You need to deliver an
important letter to the city.

1455
02:08:01,833 --> 02:08:06,208
To Mr.Bipin, in
the local court.

1456
02:08:06,292 --> 02:08:09,208
He'll send it to
the right place.

1457
02:08:09,292 --> 02:08:16,042
I don't think it's wise to
leave the house now.

1458
02:08:16,333 --> 02:08:20,042
They could attack any time.

1459
02:08:22,125 --> 02:08:26,333
You are right.

1460
02:08:26,667 --> 02:08:31,875
But this letter is
very important too.

1461
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,167
Alright.

1462
02:08:37,500 --> 02:08:42,708
I'll get the guns out,
just in case.

1463
02:08:42,833 --> 02:08:47,042
I'll deliver the letter tomorrow.

1464
02:09:14,125 --> 02:09:18,667
Last minute plans will
be executed thus.

1465
02:09:19,875 --> 02:09:25,792
That's not a problem.
Just don't forget my plan.

1466
02:09:27,458 --> 02:09:32,875
Keep your end of the
bargain, I'll keep mine.

1467
02:09:41,625 --> 02:09:43,833
Greetings, Mr.Shashi.

1468
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:46,333
Is everything ready?
- Yes.

1469
02:09:46,958 --> 02:09:50,167
The police will be on the
Debiganj side of the house.

1470
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:53,417
Spoke to Mr.Akhtar.
They'll be there on time.

1471
02:09:53,583 --> 02:09:56,042
Men and weapons are in the car.

1472
02:09:56,125 --> 02:10:02,208
If we rat the whores out of their
hole, we feast on them all night?

1473
02:10:39,667 --> 02:10:41,333
You alright?
- Yes.

1474
02:10:41,583 --> 02:10:44,250
Written the letter to
Begum Jaan as per plan?

1475
02:10:44,417 --> 02:10:47,292
Yes. Written
everything. Let's go.

1476
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,667
Come along.

1477
02:10:50,625 --> 02:10:52,917
You left something out!

1478
02:10:54,083 --> 02:10:56,667
Finish it off!

1479
02:11:13,708 --> 02:11:19,625
Only clients & business
& oppression & Professor...

1480
02:11:20,375 --> 02:11:23,875
That's all you've written about.

1481
02:11:26,458 --> 02:11:33,833
No mention of how I
nursed you back to life.

1482
02:11:35,708 --> 02:11:38,833
None at all.

1483
02:11:39,333 --> 02:11:47,333
Or how I massaged you all
night during pregnancy.

1484
02:11:53,292 --> 02:11:57,917
Countless days of counselling,

1485
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:05,250
stopping you from
commiting suicide...

1486
02:12:09,167 --> 02:12:13,667
Didn't mention a lot of things.

1487
02:12:15,167 --> 02:12:22,083
Fattening a cow for the
slaughterhouse is not love.

1488
02:12:22,167 --> 02:12:25,292
Ungrateful bitch!
- Salim!

1489
02:12:28,042 --> 02:12:30,250
Salim.

1490
02:12:39,875 --> 02:12:42,750
The kid has grown up.

1491
02:12:45,917 --> 02:12:47,833
Let her go.

1492
02:12:51,708 --> 02:12:53,625
Let's go.

1493
02:13:16,875 --> 02:13:19,208
You can go ahead now.

1494
02:13:42,292 --> 02:13:44,792
Something's not right.

1495
02:13:44,875 --> 02:13:46,542
I feel the same.

1496
02:13:46,625 --> 02:13:48,208
Guns ready?
- Yes.

1497
02:13:48,250 --> 02:13:49,750
Cartridges?
- Ready.

1498
02:13:49,792 --> 02:13:52,375
Let's get everyone.

1499
02:13:52,583 --> 02:13:54,875
Give it to me.

1500
02:13:56,583 --> 02:13:58,292
Get in.

1501
02:14:03,250 --> 02:14:08,500
Better get going. It'll be
a strenuous journey.

1502
02:14:09,792 --> 02:14:11,167
Sorry.

1503
02:14:12,167 --> 02:14:15,958
Wanted to see Begum Jaan
die twice. Hence, all this.

1504
02:14:16,125 --> 02:14:20,958
Just saw it once.
Will now see it again.

1505
02:14:21,500 --> 02:14:23,000
But...

1506
02:14:23,667 --> 02:14:25,625
marriage?

1507
02:14:28,417 --> 02:14:34,292
Whores don't have
husbands. They have clients.

1508
02:15:07,083 --> 02:15:10,625
Grandma, lock your door!
- Come with me.

1509
02:15:10,750 --> 02:15:13,750
Jnui, escape with Shabnam &
Bnuchki through the backdoor.

1510
02:15:13,833 --> 02:15:17,250
I won't go anywhere!
- Why not? Gone mad?

1511
02:15:17,375 --> 02:15:20,208
Can't leave in such
dangerous times!

1512
02:15:20,333 --> 02:15:22,708
What about Bnuchki & Shabnam?

1513
02:15:22,917 --> 02:15:25,292
Don't argue! It's been decided!

1514
02:15:25,333 --> 02:15:28,250
It hasn't! I can't
leave you all for my kid!

1515
02:15:28,542 --> 02:15:31,292
She's our kid too!

1516
02:15:31,375 --> 02:15:33,875
They can attack at any time!

1517
02:15:34,208 --> 02:15:38,167
Stop arguing & escape!
They might-

1518
02:15:40,500 --> 02:15:43,458
Bastards!

1519
02:15:45,625 --> 02:15:46,875
Leave!

1520
02:15:47,083 --> 02:15:48,250
Get out!

1521
02:15:48,333 --> 02:15:50,292
Face me, you bastards!

1522
02:15:59,250 --> 02:16:01,583
Take aim properly!

1523
02:16:07,458 --> 02:16:08,458
Bastards!

1524
02:16:08,708 --> 02:16:12,125
Bastards, will kill you all!

1525
02:16:16,875 --> 02:16:19,167
Can't even hold a gun properly!

1526
02:16:22,167 --> 02:16:23,708
Bloody fuckers!

1527
02:16:35,792 --> 02:16:38,958
You all should switch
to their profession.

1528
02:16:52,250 --> 02:16:54,250
Bloody bastards!

1529
02:17:04,500 --> 02:17:06,250
I'll kill you all!

1530
02:17:14,833 --> 02:17:16,417
Scoundrels!

1531
02:17:23,125 --> 02:17:24,500
Fuckers!

1532
02:17:28,667 --> 02:17:30,958
Won't let you escape!

1533
02:17:31,333 --> 02:17:33,917
Where are all these
bullets coming from?

1534
02:17:33,958 --> 02:17:35,167
Move forward!

1535
02:17:36,208 --> 02:17:38,000
Kill them all!

1536
02:17:59,083 --> 02:18:02,083
Get more ammunition quick!

1537
02:18:17,167 --> 02:18:19,958
What happened? Koli!
- Koli! Koli! Koli!

1538
02:18:20,167 --> 02:18:23,625
Cowards! Attacking
us from behind!

1539
02:18:33,875 --> 02:18:36,792
Let her go! Leave her!

1540
02:18:52,917 --> 02:18:56,333
Get back Duli!
You'll get shot!

1541
02:18:59,542 --> 02:19:01,250
Begum Jaan!

1542
02:19:02,167 --> 02:19:03,750
Bloody swines!

1543
02:19:19,667 --> 02:19:23,750
What's the hurry, sweetheart?

1544
02:20:15,208 --> 02:20:16,500
Hey!

1545
02:20:22,375 --> 02:20:23,833
Hey!

1546
02:20:31,792 --> 02:20:33,375
Hey!

1547
02:20:39,417 --> 02:20:42,542
Let them go!

1548
02:20:42,917 --> 02:20:45,667
Make sure they're safe.

1549
02:22:21,292 --> 02:22:23,083
Oh Allah!

1550
02:22:42,250 --> 02:22:43,875
Hey!

1551
02:22:48,250 --> 02:22:50,375
Welcome, sir.

1552
02:22:50,500 --> 02:22:54,708
Were playing Holi for so long.
Now begins the sacrifice.

1553
02:22:55,708 --> 02:22:57,542
Of the Vestan Virgins.

1554
02:23:14,750 --> 02:23:17,167
There you go.

1555
02:23:17,208 --> 02:23:19,792
The job is done.

1556
02:23:33,458 --> 02:23:35,792
Hey!

1557
02:25:02,958 --> 02:25:05,792
Uncle Salim!

1558
02:25:20,583 --> 02:25:23,542
Uncle Salim!

1559
02:25:32,750 --> 02:25:35,708
Oh Allah! Save me!

1560
02:25:52,708 --> 02:25:55,292
Sir...

1561
02:25:55,708 --> 02:26:00,667
my boys will have some
fun with these refugees.

1562
02:26:00,750 --> 02:26:03,333
You mustn't stay.

1563
02:26:03,792 --> 02:26:06,125
Won't be able to tolerate it.

1564
02:26:06,167 --> 02:26:07,833
As in?

1565
02:27:08,917 --> 02:27:10,833
Hey!

1566
02:27:14,500 --> 02:27:17,583
Listen, you bloody whores!

1567
02:27:28,042 --> 02:27:30,625
No patron will save you!

1568
02:27:31,833 --> 02:27:34,417
Where are you going?

1569
02:27:34,542 --> 02:27:38,000
They're all mad!

1570
02:28:25,875 --> 02:28:29,000
Grandma...

1571
02:28:30,792 --> 02:28:35,625
that story...

1572
02:28:38,583 --> 02:28:42,375
read it out to me.

1573
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:50,708
<i>When the darkest, moonless
night engulfed the world,</i>

1574
02:28:50,833 --> 02:28:56,583
<i>When the Sun & Moon
vanished from the overhead sky,</i>

1575
02:28:56,625 --> 02:29:04,625
<i>12000 Rajput queens started
on their Jauhar (Mass suicide) ceremony.</i>

1576
02:29:05,208 --> 02:29:12,375
<i>To protect their honour
from the invaders.</i>

1577
02:29:12,458 --> 02:29:20,458
<i>Standing in front of a dark
tunnel, beside the temple in Chittor,</i>

1578
02:29:21,125 --> 02:29:28,917
<i>Queen Padmini started
worshipping Agni (Fire God).</i>

1579
02:29:29,333 --> 02:29:31,917
<i>"Oh Fire God!</i>

1580
02:29:32,417 --> 02:29:37,083
<i>The Holy One, with the
Bright Golden Body, come!</i>

1581
02:29:39,375 --> 02:29:43,917
<i>Dissipate all darkness
with your light!</i>

1582
02:29:44,042 --> 02:29:48,625
<i>Oh Fire God! The
Ultimate Power, come!</i>

1583
02:29:49,208 --> 02:29:54,083
<i>You're strength of the weak
& support for the strong!</i>

1584
02:29:57,542 --> 02:30:03,750
<i>Oh Terrible One!
Dispel our fear!</i>

1585
02:30:04,125 --> 02:30:09,500
<i>Destroy our guilt!
Give us refuge!</i>

1586
02:30:09,708 --> 02:30:16,333
<i>The end of shame &
misery, in Your flames!</i>

1587
02:30:16,750 --> 02:30:22,958
<i>You're the last Hope!
The last Chain of Great Freedom!"</i>

1588
02:30:23,208 --> 02:30:28,125
<i>Incantating thus, Queen
Padmini went silent.</i>

1589
02:30:28,167 --> 02:30:35,374
<i>Suddenly, raising a great furore,</i>

1590
02:30:35,375 --> 02:30:43,375
<i>a 1000 happy flames leapt
up from within the tunnel!</i>

1591
02:30:45,750 --> 02:30:51,917
<i>The dark night was
shattered by the light!</i>

1592
02:30:52,083 --> 02:31:00,083
<i>Queen Padmini plunged into the
pyre with 12000 Rajput women!</i>

1593
02:31:02,958 --> 02:31:10,500
<i>The smiling faces & the
echoing laughter of Chittor,</i>

1594
02:31:10,750 --> 02:31:18,667
<i>turned into ashes in
a matter of seconds.</i>

1595
02:31:18,708 --> 02:31:24,208
<i>And every Rajput heart,
cried out aloud,</i>

1596
02:31:24,458 --> 02:31:28,542
<i>"Hail the Pious One!</i>

1597
02:31:28,667 --> 02:31:33,625
<i>Hail the Pious One!"</i>

1598
02:32:13,583 --> 02:32:19,417
<i>Your call is announced
continuously</i>

1599
02:32:19,458 --> 02:32:24,792
<i>We heed Your gracious call</i>

1600
02:32:24,958 --> 02:32:30,667
<i>Hindus, Buddhists,
Sikhs, Jains, Parsis,</i>

1601
02:32:30,917 --> 02:32:36,125
<i>Muslims & Christians</i>

1602
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:42,083
<i>The Orient & the
Occident come together</i>

1603
02:32:42,542 --> 02:32:48,042
<i>To the side of Your throne</i>

1604
02:32:48,542 --> 02:32:53,708
<i>And weave the garland of love.</i>

1605
02:32:54,333 --> 02:32:59,917
<i>Oh! You who bring in
the unity of the people</i>
