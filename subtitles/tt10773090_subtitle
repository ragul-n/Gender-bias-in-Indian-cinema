1
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,510
Good morning, ma’am.
- Good morning… Sit down.

2
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,050
Collect and package the remaining
samples in seperate bundles.

3
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,180
Take additional samples at distance
of 1, 10, 25 and 50 feet.

4
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,720
Hey!

5
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,430
Excuse me, ma’am.

6
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,140
He is misbehaving with me.

7
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,930
Get up.

8
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,930
What have you done?

9
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,970
I just pinched her because
she looks good, ma’am.

10
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,760
Are you drunk?

11
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,510
Actually, I was drunk last night.
I’m still hung over from that.

12
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:36,720
Get out of my class.

13
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,100
Excuse me, ma’am...
Principal sir wants to see you.

14
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,510
Tell me, sir.

15
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,720
I was told you suspended him
because he was drunk in class.

16
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,470
This is his father.
He’s a dear friend of the establishment.

17
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,470
Excuse him for now.

18
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:07,220
I’m surprised that you
are taking it so easy.

19
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:09,180
He was drunk, sir.

20
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,010
He’s pursuing medicine.

21
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,600
A mistake in his line of work
costs someone their life.

22
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,470
I'm sorry, sir.

23
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,930
Listen…

24
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,300
We belong to the same city.

25
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,350
It’s not just the kids
who roam around drunk.

26
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,220
Even truck drivers are often on booze.

27
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:28,930
Watch out.

28
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,760
This is what you’re supposed to do
when your son commits a mistake.

29
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,350
Not throw complaints and threats.

30
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,890
In my 15 years of
professional career...

31
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,350
I have never accepted
anything that is wrong.

32
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:54,760
When it was wrong, I told it as it is.

33
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,390
And I will continue to do so.

34
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,720
Now if you may...

35
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:15,350
Give me a dozen apples

36
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:19,220
I need Gilly flowers and chrysanthemum

37
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,930
- Hello, ma’am.
- Hello.

38
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,800
Why did you skip tuition yesterday?

39
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,930
Err... I went to watch a movie, ma’am.

40
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,600
From tomorrow onwards,
you’ll help your dad during the day.

41
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,640
And attend tuition during the night. Okay?

42
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,550
- Alright. Bye, ma’am.
- Bye.

43
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,100
When is the groom’s side arriving, uncle?

44
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,390
They will be here in 30 minutes, dear.

45
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,350
- Give it to me.
- Father…

46
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,220
- The material for rituals...
- Give it to your sister.

47
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,350
You aren’t supposed to use
your left hand during auspicious events.

48
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,720
It’s okay, uncle. He’s left-handed.

49
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,640
Mom...

50
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,550
- Go get ready quickly. Go!
- Okay.

51
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,850
You nurtured three beautiful kids despite
being a single mom.

52
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,180
You’re raising an abandoned kid
as your own.

53
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:16,220
You’ve got a really big heart.

54
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:19,800
Only someone who knows pain
comes forward to help.

55
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,850
Mom, how do I look?

56
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,180
Looks like you inherited the house
from your grandparents.

57
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,890
Brother-in-law, is the roof made of tiles?
Care to tell me?

58
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,100
Hey! Shut up, will you?

59
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,100
I heard your elder son was
martyred in the army.

60
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,350
Poor woman! Your daughter-in-law became
a widow at such a young age.

61
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,640
How could you still send your
younger son to the army?

62
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,890
Nowadays patriotism has become
a fancy thing, brother-in-law.

63
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,640
What do your kids do?

64
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,510
The value of rupee is dropping by day.

65
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,140
So my elder son is in UK,
making pounds.

66
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,430
And my younger son is
making dollars in the US.

67
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,970
While your kids are away...

68
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,390
I’ve sent my kids to the border
to guard your house.

69
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,550
You see the value of a country
in its currency.

70
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,970
I see it in the waving flag.

71
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,850
And we are all proud to be
a soldier’s family.

72
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,640
Hey! You go and sit in the car.

73
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,640
- Brother-in-law...
- Go!

74
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,600
Okay.

75
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,640
Please ignore him...

76
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,470
We wanted this alliance after getting
to know your family history.

77
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,350
Priest, fix a date and time.

78
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,180
This 14th is a really auspicious day.

79
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,800
Fix that date.
I’ll ask my son to return at the earliest.

80
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,800
Major Ajay Krishna, come in.
Bomb squad required immediately.

81
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,470
- Everything is under control, sir.
- Aim right there.

82
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,890
Traffic is diverted to different routes.

83
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,890
Hey, Singh… Come here.

84
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,720
We’ve located the bomb 30 minutes ago.

85
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,390
But we can’t do anything about it
until he arrives.

86
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,220
When will your Major reach?

87
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,430
Sir...

88
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,930
- Is everything under control?
- Yes, sir.

89
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,470
- Did you clear the crowd?
- Yes, sir.

90
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:17,300
If you find anyone looking suspicious
with a mobile phone, just shoot him.

91
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,890
Good morning, sir!

92
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,550
You don’t have to call me sir
if you’re so uncomfortable.

93
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,010
You can call me Ajay,
considering we’re good friends.

94
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,350
- Morning,son.
- Yes... Morning, Mr. Prasad.

95
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,220
What's going on?

96
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,390
We’re not gathered at a family party.
There’s a bomb here.

97
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,470
Everyone is worried as
to when it will explode.

98
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,720
We can take it slow.
Let’s have a cup of coffee first.

99
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,970
You want to have coffee now?

100
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,470
- But the bomb...
- What’s the big deal?

101
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,010
We cleared the area.

102
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,390
Only both our lives are at risk.

103
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:51,430
Your hands are shivering from the cold.

104
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,850
If you cut the wrong wire by mistake...

105
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,350
Boom! It'll explode!

106
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:01,550
We’ll both die and our souls
will float in the air together.

107
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,260
Aren’t you going to leave
my soul alone at least?

108
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,970
If my soul asks you, ‘Mr. Prasad, you didn’t
even let me have a cup of coffee first’

109
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,300
What is your soul’s answer going to be?

110
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,720
You don’t have to go that far
for a cup of coffee.

111
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,510
Increase the flame.

112
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:30,050
Pour the milk in.

113
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,010
Who’s going to add sugar, huh?

114
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,930
Why don’t you make it yourself?

115
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,300
You carry on, dear.

116
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,390
It is great fun to supervise over
some other director’s film.

117
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,470
If it’s a hit, we can take total credit.

118
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,760
But if it flunks,
we can give him the entire credit.

119
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,140
That coffee was a
blockbuster, Mr. Prasad.

120
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,050
You know Mr. Prasad here
is terrified of bombs.

121
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,140
Why don’t you put your
bomb suit on for safety?

122
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:08,390
Safety? I don’t know. It will be
suffocating if at all I die in there.

123
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,550
I want to die in peace. Come on.

124
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,260
Listen. Nothing is going to change.

125
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:15,180
I’m not taking my suit off for you.

126
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:27,510
Hey! You’re opening it like
it’s some rice bag.

127
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
Ah, come on, Mr. Prasad!

128
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,100
We planted and dismantled quite
a few of these.

129
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,930
Look... At least respect my opinion,
considering my age and our friendship.

130
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,550
I caught him, sir. I got him.

131
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,890
It’s him, sir… Kill him.

132
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:33,260
He was running, sir.
I struggled hard to catch him.

133
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,600
It’s him, sir! It’s him.
- What’s the confusion, Singh?

134
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,180
I can’t make out who it is
amongst the two.

135
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,140
Hey, are you doing this
with proof or as a fluke?

136
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,350
Mr. Prasad, when this guy was running,
he first stepped into mud.

137
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:56,720
Look at his shoe.

138
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,510
When he turned around the corner, the blue
paint on the wall got on to his shirt.

139
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:02,100
Look at the blue paint. Not me.

140
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,890
True.

141
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,720
Prasad, they are our juniors…

142
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,800
You are a senior…
You need to be vigilant.

143
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,100
You can't just go into it blindly.

144
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,930
Sir, we need to go to the camp.

145
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,350
What’s so urgent?

146
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,970
We have a celebrity
interaction in the evening.

147
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,510
Is Singh blushing?
So it is definitely some heroine.

148
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,720
Who is it?

149
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,350
- Actually, sir...
- Stop curling up and tell me who it is.

150
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,430
It’s Tamannaah, sir.

151
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Come on! Clap!

152
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,970
Hello, ma'am.

153
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,470
We have a celebrity interacting
with us every year.

154
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,550
This year we have the very gorgeous,
Tamannaah Bhatia.

155
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,100
Good evening, guys.

156
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,680
You are our inspiration.

157
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,550
There's nothing I can do
differently to inspire you.

158
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,550
So I'll answer your questions.

159
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,050
Miss Tamannaah, tell us
something about the army.

160
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:01,220
You guys are the real heroes.

161
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:07,760
Tamannaah, what do you
love to do the most?

162
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,510
What do I love to do the most...?

163
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,350
Dance.

164
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:13,720
Hey, Singh...

165
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,180
She loves dance, man.

166
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,930
Miss Tamannaah, shall we have a dance?

167
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,510
Done!

168
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,220
I'll dance with the real heroes tonight!

169
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,050
Hello!

170
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,350
"There's a party in my house tonight"

171
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,350
"Join us"

172
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,260
"There's a party in my house tonight"

173
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:20,100
"Don't miss it for the world"

174
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,510
"There's a party in my house tonight"

175
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,470
"Don't miss it for the world"

176
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,600
"I'll call a DJ and rock the bass"

177
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,010
"Ill pump the speakers as
we rock the dance floor"

178
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,550
"Is it going to be peppy and kicking?

179
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,890
"is it going to be jolly?
If so, we are all for it"

180
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:52,970
"Let's party with a song"

181
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,430
"We'll remember it life long"

182
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,760
"Let's party with this song"

183
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:03,260
"We'll remember it life long"

184
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,470
"1...2...3...4...
Get on the dance floor"

185
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,050
"Let's groove to this mass-y music"

186
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,550
"Let's have a fun ride as the
guitar strings play out loud"

187
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:27,970
"I can sense a wild fire between us"

188
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,640
"With the beats of disco in a dim light"

189
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,930
"Let this night end on a high note"

190
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:38,470
With shots to drink and hugs to share

191
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,720
"Let's lighten up the
party environment"

192
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:46,760
"Let's party with this song"

193
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,100
"We'll remember it life long"

194
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:53,390
"Let's party!!!"

195
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,510
"Time to get yourself a little naughty"

196
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,050
"One more time!"

197
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,720
“Let’s party… Let's party with this song"

198
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,300
"We'll remember it life long"

199
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:31,760
"Let's party with this song"

200
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,430
"We'll remember it life long"

201
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

202
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,240
Can I speak to Ajay, please?

203
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:08,950
Ajay sir...! There's a call for you.

204
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,490
A call for me? Who is it?

205
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,780
Your mother, sir.

206
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,860
There must be a new joinee with that name.
Check again. -Okay, sir.

207
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,450
Mother… That word feels
good to hear it.

208
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,820
It would have been
great if I had a mother.

209
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,990
Loneliness is a battle.

210
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,400
We have to keep fighting it.

211
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,570
Hello, mom.

212
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,780
I’ve been trying to
reach you since 3 days.

213
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,900
I finally managed to get you on call.

214
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,820
Unexpectedly, I'm here at
the new regiment today.

215
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,150
I confirmed that alliance for sister.

216
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,860
He’s a really good guy.

217
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,740
Sister is really lucky, mom.

218
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,030
Don’t worry about the expenses.
I’ve got it all figured.

219
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:52,820
- How is she?
- She is very happy,

220
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,200
- When are you coming home?
- I’m going to apply for leave right away!

221
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,530
I just hope this wedding changes
her life for the better.

222
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,070
I'm very happy, mother.

223
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,740
I'll come back home
as soon as possible.

224
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,110
Sir.

225
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,900
- Show me that footage.
- Yes, sir.

226
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:31,400
Release our captive
that you're holding.

227
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,240
You have one day time.

228
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,780
If you try to act smart…

229
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,530
I’ll kill these kids brutally.

230
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,530
The one in the mask is Wasim Mohamed.

231
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,860
From the 'Mujahudin’ group.

232
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,240
Alright. So we have two options now.

233
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,610
Meet their demands and have
the kids released.

234
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,990
Or else, we go with
the rescue operation.

235
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,240
We’ve been trying to catch him
for quite a while now.

236
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,740
He is the big fish.

237
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,030
It’s a delicate issue, sir.

238
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,320
If something happens to the children,
it’ll be more problematic.

239
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,860
In that case, we could negotiate
with him one more time.

240
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,150
This is not a vegetable market
to bargain for lives.

241
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,280
We are the Indian Army and we
have the guts to bring them down.

242
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,110
Sorry, sir. Please allow me to do this.

243
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,150
I’ll get those kids back unharmed, sir.

244
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,610
That’s like my boy Ajay.

245
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,650
Go ahead.

246
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,740
Boys! Are you ready for the operation?
-Yes, sir!

247
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,700
- Right now!
- Yes, sir.

248
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,820
At sharp 8'o clock...

249
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,280
Indian Army bullet will
pierce through his head.

250
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,700
Move!

251
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,990
Have a cup of coffee and
watch it live, sir.

252
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,400
It’s a great visual when
the kids come out smiling.

253
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
Come on boys! Move it! Move it!

254
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,610
Move it boys, come on!

255
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,650
Point to right side balcony
and take the shot.

256
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,400
I can’t shoot, sir.

257
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,200
There will be a loud sound
if he falls on the car.

258
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,740
Just take the shot.

259
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,610
8 members in the ground floor
And 8 members in the balcony.

260
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,070
Four of you cover me.
- Sir...

261
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,030
- Singh... Take out the Skateboard.
- Sir.

262
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,820
First floor clear, sir.
- Move.

263
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,900
Sir...

264
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,740
I guess this is the only way in, sir.

265
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,150
I think we are stuck.

266
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,650
There must be a way.

267
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,240
Just wait for some time.

268
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,860
Where the hell are you hiding, cowards?

269
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,490
Show yourself!

270
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:24,990
Indian Army! Indian Army!

271
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,070
You fancy being the heroes, huh?

272
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,240
Show yourself.

273
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,490
Why are you hiding like cowards?

274
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:32,490
Show yourself!

275
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,280
Singing ‘Hum Tum Ek
Kamre Mein Bandh Ho’

276
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,200
Why is he singing songs
like Mohammad Rafi?

277
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,200
Show yourself if you're manly enough!

278
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,900
Why are you hiding like a bunch of losers?
Come on out!

279
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:50,700
I’ll kill each and every one of you.

280
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,110
Show yourself!

281
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,280
It's a trap!! Ajay!!

282
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,150
Ajay! Ajay!

283
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,650
- Take him out now!
- Sir...

284
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,570
Call for the medical support immediately.
-Okay, sir.

285
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:25,450
Take him out now!
Come on! Come on!

286
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,280
Do you read me, Ajay?

287
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,740
Yes, sir.

288
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,990
Ajay, do you need some extra force?
Do you read me?

289
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,950
No need, sir... I’ll step out with
all the kids like I promised.

290
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,450
Just wait and watch, sir.

291
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,450
How did you like my gift?

292
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,320
We have a present for you actually.

293
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,570
I’ve decided to shoot
everyone instead of just you.

294
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,950
I can’t hear you.

295
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,860
Major ‘Silly Cat’...

296
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,650
Major ‘Silly Cat’… Meow!

297
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,650
He’s not a silly cat, man.

298
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,990
Look... The lion is here.

299
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,530
Farooq, kill the kids!!!

300
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,820
What else?

301
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,070
You cussed me and I shot you for it.

302
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,240
Oh man! You cussed me real bad.

303
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,740
You got my mother into this.

304
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,860
But do you know why I
didn’t cuss your mother?

305
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,360
Because I respect your mother too.

306
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,450
Sir, he is severely injured and
the chances are very less.

307
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,900
A solider from that family has already
died for the country before.

308
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,450
Unfortunately, his brother is
in a critical condition now.

309
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,570
He met me just 2 days back and told
me about his sister’s wedding.

310
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,610
Sir, my sister is getting
married in 10 days.

311
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
I’ll be really happy if
you grant my leave.

312
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:19,070
My mom and sister are really
excited about the wedding.

313
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,740
According to the rules,
we need to inform them immediately.

314
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,950
But that may cancel his sister's wedding.

315
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,950
His whole family might be disturbed.

316
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:32,280
If we follow morale, one of us could attend
the wedding and tell them post the wedding.

317
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,990
Sir, rules or morale?

318
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,030
If you ask me, I would say morale.

319
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,780
One of us should attend the wedding
and tell the mother smoothly.

320
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:49,200
It’s the least we can do for a family
that’s sacrificed so much for the country.

321
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,490
There is no meaning to his bravery.

322
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:57,030
Sir, now the question is, on
behalf of the Indian Army...

323
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,650
Who will take this responsibility?

324
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,400
That’s like my boy Ajay.

325
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,450
I know only you can do it.

326
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,490
Only you can make it happen.

327
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,610
So Ajay... You've got to go tomorrow.
Remember to keep me posted.

328
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,740
And… Take someone with you
if you need to.

329
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,530
No... I'm not going with you.

330
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,740
Thanks for accepting, Mr. Prasad.

331
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,110
The next 10 days are going
to be so exciting.

332
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,610
That's what worries me.

333
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,030
I was terrified to
dismantle a bomb with you.

334
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,490
How can I make it through
10 days with you?

335
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,530
By the way, which place
are we going to?

336
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:59,150
[chanting prayers]

337
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:13,240
"Master is the Creator, Lord and Almighty!
I bow to you, My Master!"

338
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:23,360
Master... You took retirement
to lead a peaceful life.

339
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,030
Do you know why I brought you along?

340
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:27,200
What the hell did you
teach us in school?

341
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,400
What did you tell me when you made me
squat in front of the entire class?

342
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:32,990
‘Harm others and karma will pay back”
-I’ve harmed so many people.

343
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,150
But I’m doing absolutely fine.
I became an MLA.

344
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,650
What did you tell me when you
made me stand under the sun?

345
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,780
‘A pen is mightier than a sword.’
-I used a sword and became the Minister.

346
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,860
You taught all the wrong stuff
and looted fee from my father.

347
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,360
You ruined my childhood.

348
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:51,400
I brought you here to show you
what true knowledge is.

349
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,740
Oh.

350
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,610
Why are you still talking to him?

351
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,740
Put him down, chop off his arms,
slit his throat and…

352
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,360
Oh my god!

353
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,280
Father..

354
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,360
Master...

355
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,990
If at least one of your teachings were
true, you can leave right away.

356
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:07,570
Otherwise, you're not going home.

357
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:11,200
Brother, Ramireddy is protesting
at the fort against us.

358
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,990
Then lay him down and slit his throat.

359
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,740
Father…

360
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,030
Master...

361
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,280
It’s your school time.

362
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,860
Come, I’ll take your class.

363
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,320
What is this ruckus, Ramireddy?

364
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,360
We need to sort it out like adults.
But you are already protesting.

365
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,860
Have I done anything since so many
years in spite of being the Minister?

366
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,900
But I’m still winning, right?

367
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,990
People are busy with their life. Why do you
take the trouble of protesting? Let's talk.

368
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,990
You’ve committed every possible
sin in the name of power.

369
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,070
I’ll have an enquiry on you.

370
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:02,110
I’ll have you locked up.

371
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,360
‘Your anger is your enemy.’

372
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,360
‘Your calm is your guardian angel.’

373
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:12,820
You told me this when you
pinched my thigh in 4th grade.

374
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,030
I don’t think it’s true.

375
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,110
I dealt with Ramireddy so calmly...
But it didn’t work.

376
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,950
He wants to issue an enquiry on me
and put me behind bars.

377
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,400
You and your bloody teachings!

378
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,950
Hey, Ramireddy!

379
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,070
You need to be really
gutsy to go against me.

380
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,070
Setting up a small tent to
protest will not cut it.

381
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,150
Do you want to know the consequences
of standing against me?

382
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,900
It will be war!

383
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,150
This is how a brawl should be.

384
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,740
Look at the tent...
Looks like a wedding trellis.

385
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,320
And you’re glowing like a groom.

386
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,700
Protest now. Let me see who will stop you.

387
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,990
Protest till you die.

388
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,860
But when it’s around 6 pm,

389
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,490
the sun will go down slowly.

390
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:36,700
And by the time it’s 8 pm,
everyone will head back home.

391
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,200
Soon it will be 9 pm and
we’re in power now.

392
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,530
Don't you think we can switch off
the electricity for 30 minutes?

393
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,030
Amongst the 100 people around you,
10 of them might be carrying swords.

394
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,650
Or axes and shovels for that matter.

395
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:54,740
They might be having a plan
to kill you for me.

396
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,280
And by 10:30, you’ll be dead.

397
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,740
What say, Ramireddy?

398
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,200
They will kill you for going against me.

399
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,900
They will choke you first
and then slit your throat.

400
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,490
The person who stabs you
will not feel a thing.

401
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,570
They do it for the money.

402
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,240
They’ll get drunk, go
home and doze off.

403
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:28,650
But you have a wife and kid waiting
for you at home, right?

404
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,240
You have parents too.

405
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,740
Fighting me was a pretty bad idea.

406
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,900
Sir, you only give me the lemon juice.

407
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,070
I’ll drink it and break the protest.

408
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:56,950
I’ll make mistakes, Reddy.
And everyone should accept them.

409
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,360
Sorry, sir.

410
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,490
‘Your anger is not your enemy.’

411
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,280
This is the lesson you
should be teaching.

412
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,400
‘A vulture might prey on several birds.’
‘But a single cyclone will sweep it away.’

413
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,740
I will hunt the cyclone too.

414
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,530
Ask that cyclone to show up urgently.

415
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:40,290
When I play cards, the groom’s
side is bound to lose.

416
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,410
No way! The groom's side
won't have any luck.

417
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,660
You’re right, brother-in-law.

418
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,040
Anyway, I got a joker.

419
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,330
Let me win this game, brother-in-law.

420
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,410
We’re the bride’s side.

421
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:56,290
I haven’t seen owners mingle
with the maids in so long.

422
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,450
Oh no! They’re not the maids.

423
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,370
He’s the elder son-in-law
and he’s the second.

424
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,080
Future son-in-law and brother-in-law.

425
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,250
It’s the bride’s side after all.

426
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,540
My son had a few flaws
in his horoscope.

427
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,410
So we got some rituals done in Kasi.

428
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,330
- Wedding is in Kurnool.
- So cute!

429
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,370
Dear, hot water for you.

430
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:21,500
Is she your elder daughter?

431
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,040
Why would she call me ‘dear’
if she were my daughter?

432
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,160
She’s my wife.

433
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,250
She’s your wife?

434
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,370
Mother of three children?

435
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,620
I got married at the age of 14.

436
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,290
I was literally forced into it.

437
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:41,160
Yeah, right. Also tell them I begged you
to cooperate on our nuptial night.

438
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,830
Dear, you can’t reveal these
details in public.

439
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:44,870
I did it?

440
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,620
Take it.

441
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,750
Hold it. Hold it.
Put the drape down and hold it.

442
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,540
What did I ask you for?

443
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,450
- Lukewarm water.
- What did you get me?

444
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,620
Hot water.

445
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,410
Hold the glass till the water
is lukewarm.

446
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,250
Come on, brother-in-law!
You’re being sadistic.

447
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:01,660
Here.

448
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:06,080
This is being sadistic?

449
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,540
This is perfection, brother-in-law.

450
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:10,120
Being the groom’s side, you’re
enduring so much embarrassment.

451
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,540
Do you really need this wedding?

452
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:14,790
When it’s a groom like this, we need
to put up with a lot of humiliation.

453
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,910
Do you want puff?

454
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:23,540
Who’s getting hitched to this fool?

455
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,870
We need to stop this wedding before
the train reaches Kurnool.

456
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,250
We need to make sure our sister
doesn’t go through our fate.

457
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,290
Our third daughter... Samskruthi.

458
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,660
She is so cute!

459
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,700
Are you going to ruin her life?

460
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,950
Find a handsome guy and
run away with him.

461
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,830
I love you.

462
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,580
- Are you joking?
- No.

463
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:07,000
I’ll get married to you and you only.

464
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,000
Do you get it?

465
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,200
But I’m already married.

466
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:13,290
I don’t mind being your second wife.

467
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,950
But I have kids too.

468
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,750
I don’t want kids.

469
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,950
I’ll treat you like a little kid.

470
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:33,160
Accept her, son-in-law.

471
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:35,750
Accept her, brother-in-law.

472
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,120
Accept her, son.

473
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:44,540
Once you two are married,
she’ll be your booze partner.

474
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,080
Wow! These emotions...

475
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,750
Never before! Ever after!

476
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,500
Let’s move!

477
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:56,750
No luck for you!

478
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,000
Hello, uncle.

479
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,330
Your daughter and I are in love.

480
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,080
We are in love.

481
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,910
Samskruthi is mine.

482
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:12,250
You better cancel this wedding
and support our love.

483
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,830
For the first time in my life,
I dropped playing cards.

484
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,000
- Sit down.
- Okay.

485
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,450
I mean down.

486
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,160
Get up.

487
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,950
Without taking any support.

488
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,040
Knee pains…

489
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,700
Body pains.

490
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I can’t.

491
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,950
You can’t even get up
without taking support.

492
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,080
And you want me to
support your love, huh?

493
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,540
Uncle!

494
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:56,160
Fitness has nothing to do with love.

495
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,330
TC, is my berth confirmed?

496
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,580
His death is confirmed.

497
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh my god!

498
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,250
Tell me. Why did you do this?

499
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,580
Who put you up to this?

500
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:10,290
Your wife and daughter planned this.
Let me go.

501
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,000
- Will you do it again?
- Dad! Dad! No, dad!

502
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,700
- Will you ever repeat this?
- No, dad. Sorry. Sorry

503
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,410
No, dad. We’ll do whatever you say.

504
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,750
- Promise!
- We won't do it! Leave her!

505
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,160
He is your husband and this is fixed. Go!

506
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,970
Why are you torturing her?

507
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,090
Half-sister...

508
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:36,070
This is torture.

509
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,620
This is all built up anger.

510
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,820
- Do you want to eat puff?
- Shut up!

511
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:46,210
Do something and stop this wedding.

512
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:48,880
I have a superb plan… Run away!

513
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:50,920
How will you explain the
plan to me if I run away?

514
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,380
Do you get it?

515
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,840
Running away is the plan.

516
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,880
Oh!

517
00:40:56,010 --> 00:40:59,960
Your life is going to
change at the next station.

518
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,710
Oh god!

519
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,420
Show me a cute, sweet and handsome guy.

520
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,260
Do you get it?

521
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,710
Yay!!!

522
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,090
Cute! Sweet!

523
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,210
Why are you running like that?

524
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,210
Are you out of your mind?

525
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,760
Say something!
-Hey! Pull me up!

526
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,300
Move aside.

527
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:06,050
I asked you to pull me up.
Not push me away.

528
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,510
Why did you come back?

529
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,380
I'm talking to you.

530
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,460
Answer me… I’m talking to you.

531
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,300
Singing ‘Gaali Chirugali’.

532
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,570
These are our berths.

533
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,420
It would be great if this
guy became our son-in-law.

534
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,710
Our future generation
would be so ravishing.

535
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:43,340
I love you. Do you get it?

536
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:44,670
Hey!

537
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,010
Come here.

538
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,210
How can you be so shameless?

539
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:48,760
Why are you throwing kisses
and waving hands?

540
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,010
You need to respect him for his age.

541
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,550
Yuck! That kiss wasn’t for him.
It was for you.

542
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:56,130
Even you know that, don’t you?

543
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:57,710
Son, give me your hand.

544
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,340
Here are the betel leaves.

545
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,670
Thanks, auntie. I’ll have them after lunch.

546
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,550
Oh no! This is not for eating.

547
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,260
It’s part of a ritual confirming
our alliance.

548
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,670
This is my younger daughter. Say hi.

549
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,920
Hi...

550
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,420
Thank god! Now that they’ve held hands,
they’re half married.

551
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,800
Son, I want you both to look
out of the window once.

552
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:20,340
Over there.

553
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:23,460
Now they’ve finished the ritual
of seeing the ‘Arundhati’ star.

554
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,590
I’m putting her in your hands now.

555
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,760
Take good care of her.

556
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,760
She’s all yours now.

557
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,380
Let’s go.

558
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,670
Hey! Hey! Come here.

559
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,170
What's wrong?

560
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,840
You can’t just give me some betel
leaves and say we’re married.

561
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:44,050
You can't just show me the
'Arundhati' star from the train.

562
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,300
Mr. Prasad, I thought people only
abduct kids on trains.

563
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,630
But people manipulate others
into marriage as well.

564
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,710
Mr. Prasad, let's click their mug shots.

565
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,050
We’ll put them up in the coming stations.

566
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,090
Please don’t do that, son.

567
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,960
Once you have a baby...

568
00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:00,300
We’ll spend the rest of
our lives serving God.

569
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,920
She must be telling us
rhymes at this age.

570
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:03,840
I guess it’s the influence of soap operas.

571
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,960
Please sit down.

572
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,960
You wouldn’t talk like
this if you knew our pain.

573
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:09,670
My husband is a evil man.

574
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,880
He keeps torturing me for
having three baby girls.

575
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,590
Let me tell him the rest.

576
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,340
He rejected the men we loved and
got us married to two dumbos.

577
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,710
Let me tell him the rest.

578
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,920
He not only ruined my sisters’ life.

579
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,010
But he’s trying to get me married
to another loser now.

580
00:44:26,050 --> 00:44:27,210
Do you get it?

581
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,010
Let me tell him the rest.

582
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:32,010
I told her to run away
to stop this wedding.

583
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,460
Let me tell you the rest.

584
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,960
As she was about to run away,
she saw me and fell I love.

585
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:39,340
And when she told you about it,
you got us married. Like instant noodles.

586
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,960
Wow! You’re really understanding.

587
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,420
You’re a lucky girl.
He gets along with everyone pretty well.

588
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:48,050
Don’t get too excited.

589
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,010
Mr. Prasad, listening to their story...

590
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:52,670
I agree it’s wrong to get her married
against her will. Let’s fight for it.

591
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:56,880
But we can’t be in love or get married.
We're off on some really important work.

592
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,010
First let’s stop this wedding then.

593
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,460
We can get our love story back
on track before we get down.

594
00:45:01,550 --> 00:45:03,010
Fellow sister...

595
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:08,960
Don’t call any girl ‘sister’.

596
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,880
They can’t take it.

597
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,710
I said it in a flow, auntie.
- Oh no!

598
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,510
Also don’t call women our age ‘auntie’.

599
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,630
Say ‘Mrs.’

600
00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:20,510
Okay.

601
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,420
Let’s go teach your husband a lesson.

602
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:26,130
Wow! Such aggression!

603
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:28,130
Never before! Ever after!

604
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,050
Brother-in-law, I got a joker again.

605
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:33,630
Let me win this as well.

606
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:35,800
Are you out of your mind?

607
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,380
You played with your daughters’ lives.
How can you play cards and relax now?

608
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,300
They are majors.

609
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:42,170
They have the right to
marry anyone they want.

610
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:45,960
You know I was forced into
marriage at the age of 14.

611
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:49,130
I was literally forced into it.

612
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,010
Was it child marriage?

613
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:53,210
- My life is a mess.
- Stop it, will you?

614
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,670
What’s wrong with your hand?

615
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:01,670
If you want to know this secret,
you must know their secrets.

616
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:03,420
- Come here. Sit down.
- Son...

617
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:05,340
Mr. Prasad, this is interesting.
Come on. Sit down.

618
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:07,210
No, no... Don't listen to him...

619
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:15,670
Those days my BP was normal. 120/80.

620
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:18,260
My elder daughter is Swechcha
and younger daughter is Swathanthra.

621
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:21,960
I joined both of them in
a degree college that morning.

622
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,840
Swechcha brought home a guy
that evening and said they’re in love.

623
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,960
- The same evening?
- I gave them that freedom.

624
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:28,170
A little too much.

625
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:32,050
We can have kids but can
we decide their fate, son?

626
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,420
Acting like an adult!

627
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,300
She brought a guy home. And then?

628
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,710
You said something earlier, remember?
About being a major and having the right?

629
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,300
I agreed, considering the same.

630
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,710
The very next day...

631
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:44,460
He said he’s starting a business
and wants my surety for one crore.

632
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:46,510
How did you give him surety
despite knowing him for only 24 hours?

633
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:49,050
I know, right? I had the same doubt.

634
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,670
Swarajyam, what did you say then?

635
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,630
We’re giving our daughter to him.
Surety is no big deal.

636
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:56,630
Which tone did you say it in?

637
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:58,710
We’re giving our daughter to him.
Surety is no big deal.

638
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:01,510
They say wife is your better half.

639
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:03,630
So I trusted her with the decision
and signed the papers.

640
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,010
Did he start a business?

641
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:08,050
He cheated us and fled with one crore.

642
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:09,840
So did you have to pay the one crore?

643
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,670
One crore and 50 lakhs,
including court fee and interest.

644
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,510
Also 5 acres land, own house and more.

645
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:17,090
Right. That must’ve hit you hard.

646
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,010
No… For that, they put stent in my heart.

647
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,760
With this, you must have forced
your second daughter to quit college.

648
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,840
Exactly!

649
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,760
I’m father of three girls.

650
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,340
Rogues would use me a free pass to fun.

651
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,050
I appointed a tutor for
my third daughter.

652
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,710
I appointed him in the morning.

653
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,710
And my second daughter
proposed to him that evening.

654
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:41,510
Proposed to the tutor?
Same evening again?

655
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:44,460
Girls don’t need much time.

656
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,050
I asked him, ‘You’re after all a tutor.’

657
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:49,670
‘How can you take good
care of my daughter?’

658
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,800
So you did a background check
on him this time.

659
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,840
Next day, he brought home 7 kilos of gold.

660
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,300
How can a tutor get so much gold?

661
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,170
Same doubt. Swarajyam...

662
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,260
Must be his mother’s jewels.

663
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:03,010
What was your tone of voice back then?

664
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:04,760
You’re always being suspicious.

665
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,300
They must be his mother’s jewels.

666
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,050
Wife is your better half, you see.

667
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:09,260
So you must've got them engaged.

668
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,300
Exactly!

669
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:12,010
I thought his relatives would show up.

670
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,090
But the police showed up.
- Why did the police show up?

671
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,380
He didn’t bring his mother’s jewels.

672
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:17,960
He brought them from a Goddess’s temple.

673
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,880
- Oh my god! He’s a thief?
- He was kind of an expert at it.

674
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,050
Lucky, he didn’t slit your throat.

675
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:23,550
Police locked me up for a week.

676
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:24,920
And it’s called some degree, you know.

677
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:26,300
- Third degree.
- Yeah, right.

678
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,300
This whole time you must be
thinking this is some mannerism.

679
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:32,590
But it's the wrath of the
beatings I got from the police.

680
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:37,920
I get it now.

681
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,010
After all the shocks your
daughters gave you...

682
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,510
You decided to get son-in-laws
who follow your orders.

683
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,420
Bye, sir.
-Okay!

684
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,510
You understood me pretty well.

685
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,840
They fell in love with someone.

686
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,800
But I haven’t.

687
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,300
- Why do I have to marry a random guy?
- How?

688
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,590
Poor girl! She speaks logic.

689
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:59,260
How will she live with someone
she has no feelings for?

690
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,920
Good question...
I have a universal answer for that.

691
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,090
Hey, do you like me?
- Hell no!

692
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,420
She has three kids.

693
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:07,130
My elder daughter…
Do you like your husband?

694
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,090
Hell no!

695
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:09,420
She has two kids.

696
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,510
- Second daughter... Do you?
- Hell no!

697
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,920
She has one kid.

698
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:16,590
You don’t have to like the guy
in the Indian wedding culture.

699
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:19,090
You just have to get married.
You just have to go with the flow.

700
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,760
Kind of like how this train is going.

701
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:26,300
Exactly!

702
00:49:30,090 --> 00:49:33,420
Your clarity, vision and experience!

703
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:35,420
Take a bow!
- Thank you. Thank you.

704
00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:40,670
We have to do something. I want him.

705
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,130
Mom, he’s not the type
who usually falls for me.

706
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,880
I don’t even have the
time to impress him.

707
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,170
Help me out, mom.

708
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,840
I’m your mom. I can’t be
telling you this but...

709
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,050
When everyone is sleeping,
get into his bunker.

710
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:56,260
I’m not married to him.

711
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:00,130
- Do you get it?
- Ah, listen to me.

712
00:50:00,510 --> 00:50:02,840
Scream loudly when you go in.

713
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,800
We'll enter the scene, say he forced
himself on you and compel him to marry you.

714
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,710
- That’s a great plan.
- I know, right?

715
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,960
But that donkey’s with him all the time.

716
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:17,010
Give way and the donkey will be
out of sight.

717
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,300
You heard everything?

718
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:21,630
I did.

719
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:22,920
Don’t tell him.

720
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,340
I will.

721
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,050
Her life will be settled
if you help us out.

722
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,420
You don’t know him.

723
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,670
I can’t do it.
- You’re being stubborn.

724
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:38,510
But you’ll be the happiest
one if he gets married.

725
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:42,340
We know you have your differences.

726
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:43,840
True.

727
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,760
But he...

728
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,550
What thousands of Kalakeyas couldn’t
do in ‘Baahubali’...

729
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:51,090
Old man Kattappa did it
all by himself, son.

730
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:52,170
What’s that?

731
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:54,090
Stabbing Baahubali.

732
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,550
Should I?

733
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,130
Let me tell you a slogan for motivation.

734
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,260
‘Meow Meow says the cat.’

735
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:04,260
‘Here I am, getting married
to the milky brat.’

736
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:06,460
Come on. One...Two...Three...Four...

737
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:07,960
‘Meow Meow says the cat.’

738
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:09,960
‘Here I am, getting married
to the milky brat.’

739
00:51:15,170 --> 00:51:17,460
Dhotis are very comfortable Mr. Prasad.

740
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,090
AC on the top.
Dhoti on the bottom.

741
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,960
I’m going to sleep tight tonight.

742
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,510
No matter what you say, Mr. Prasad...

743
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,130
You’re my strength. My courage.

744
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:32,630
I can do anything
when you’re beside me.

745
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:35,590
Why are you sweating
in an AC compartment?

746
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:37,760
Your hands are shivering too.

747
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:39,170
You’re not planning anything behind
my back, right?

748
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:40,840
You think I would do that to you?

749
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,960
Why is she giving me that look
at this time of the night?

750
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,840
She’s going to the washroom.

751
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,960
Why would she give me that
cunning look then?

752
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,420
Her mother is also headed that way.

753
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:55,960
What’s wrong? Can’t her mother
keep her company?

754
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,340
No. Something is wrong.

755
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:01,670
Look. They’re walking back again.

756
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,550
Bathroom isn’t like bedroom, right?

757
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,130
They can’t stay in there forever.
They have to go back.

758
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,130
No.

759
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:11,550
They’re planning something fishy.
Something to do with me.

760
00:52:11,550 --> 00:52:14,010
They can’t come anywhere near you
when I’m here.

761
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:17,960
I’m your strength and courage, remember?

762
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,840
Go to sleep with the same confidence.

763
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:24,550
Come on. Go to sleep.

764
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,670
Scream loudly once you go in.

765
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,010
What's the rush?

766
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,630
I'll call you.
-Okay. Okay.

767
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,380
Wait here.
-Who is it?

768
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,760
Aren’t you asleep yet?

769
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,840
Who? Who is it?

770
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,630
I’m making sure no one disturbs you.

771
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,050
Strength, courage
and drive, remember?

772
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,550
Sleep now.
-I'll be fine.

773
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,300
You are with me… Relax.

774
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,450
Be careful with him.

775
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:26,300
Oh my goodness!

776
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,510
So cute! So sweet!

777
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,710
So handsome!

778
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:36,960
Scream!
-Please wait.

779
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,800
Sweetheart!

780
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:51,130
What are you up to?

781
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:54,380
You're supposed to yell.
Crazy girl!

782
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,590
[SCREAMING]

783
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,510
Oh no! Oh my god!

784
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:10,420
My daughter’s life is ruined.
Just like mine.

785
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,170
I was forced into marriage when I was 14.

786
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:14,920
Do you have to mention that now?

787
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,670
Yeah. Literally forced into it.

788
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:22,380
Who’s going to marry her now? Who?

789
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:24,510
Some guy forced himself onto her?

790
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,760
Call him here. We’ll get them married.

791
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,010
It was you who forced yourself onto her.

792
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,880
You should only marry her now.

793
00:54:37,670 --> 00:54:38,880
Do you get it?

794
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:43,710
Oh my god! I can’t believe this family
is manipulating me again.

795
00:54:44,170 --> 00:54:45,760
With extra drama.

796
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:48,550
What are you still waiting for?
Get him to marry her.

797
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,800
He can’t just rape her and then marry her.

798
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,590
I’ll give her a good life.

799
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,090
First arrest him.

800
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,130
I’ll get arrested.
You only marry her.

801
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,670
He might’ve forced himself
on to her but we like him.

802
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,920
We want him to marry her.

803
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:07,010
Sir, you’re the elder one here.

804
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:08,590
Even if I did do this...

805
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,460
I’d have to carry her all the
way to here, right?

806
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:14,300
She could’ve yelled for help, right?
Huh? Tell me.

807
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,880
Wow! What a logic!

808
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,050
Give him a big round of applause.

809
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:20,800
He tied my two hands and
shoved a cloth in my mouth.

810
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:23,210
Where’s the shoved
cloth and tied rope?

811
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:25,960
Wow! What a logic!
Give him a big round of applause.

812
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:26,800
Thank you. Thank you.

813
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:30,170
He tied me up with this stole and
shoved it in my mouth.

814
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,170
Do you get it?

815
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,090
Father-in-law...

816
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:41,590
Tell sister not to hit me again and again.

817
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:45,550
I’ll poke your eyes, if you
call me father-in-law again.

818
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:46,960
Why are you still talking to him?

819
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,590
First have them both married.

820
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:51,510
You’re going on and on about the marriage.
But we don’t even have a holy thread.

821
00:55:51,550 --> 00:55:53,420
Here, I have it.

822
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,130
Oh my!

823
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:56,670
You see how far they've gone?

824
00:55:56,710 --> 00:55:58,960
They made a lot of plans to cancel
the wedding you arranged.

825
00:55:59,050 --> 00:56:00,420
Do you believe this, sir?

826
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,420
Her tears kind of make it easy for me.

827
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,260
But this one’s melodrama is making it
hard again.

828
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:12,840
I wish I could have the opinion of
someone who’s not a part of this.

829
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,090
- There is one guy.
- Who is it?

830
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:16,550
My strength...

831
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,340
Courage and drive...

832
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,170
He’s the man.
Tell them, Mr. Prasad.

833
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:25,460
The truth is going to blow their
minds out and shut their mouths.

834
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,800
The truth is going to shake
this train upside down.

835
00:56:37,170 --> 00:56:38,670
Considering the situation...

836
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,380
Effect of the weather...

837
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,710
Influence of hormones...

838
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:44,210
And that attire...

839
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:46,170
Thunder rumbling...

840
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,880
Lightening striking.... Wind blowing...

841
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:50,010
In that moment of weakness...

842
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:52,050
He must have turned into a monster...

843
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,510
And forced himself onto her.

844
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:55,920
In fact, he did.

845
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,590
It was you.

846
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:17,380
I’m a monster?

847
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,420
Mr. Prasad, do you remember?

848
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:31,260
You got shot in the leg this one time
and you were crawling.

849
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,630
Mr. Prasad, look into my eyes.

850
00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:37,010
I carried you on these shoulders when there
were bombs and bullets firing around us...

851
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:39,630
Ran 4 miles and saved your life, sir.

852
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:43,260
This monster saved you.

853
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:47,670
In Siachen, when you were
frozen in the snow...

854
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,300
Mr. Prasad, look into my eyes.

855
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,670
I pulled you out, rubbed your arms
and legs till they were warm...

856
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:54,550
Inserted a pipe in your
mouth and pumped air.

857
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:56,670
That’s when you started
breathing again.

858
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,590
It was this monster that
saved you back then.

859
00:58:02,590 --> 00:58:04,010
We’ll go back to the border soon, sir.

860
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,090
We’ll go through a lot together.

861
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:07,760
And this monster won’t help you.

862
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,460
I can save you only if you tell the truth.

863
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:12,900
Otherwise, I don’t think so.

864
00:58:13,550 --> 00:58:15,460
No. No.

865
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,670
You don’t make that decision.

866
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,420
She wasn’t forced into anything.

867
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:22,630
I was.

868
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:27,760
They planned the whole thing
and manipulated me saying...

869
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,260
‘Meow Meow says the cat’

870
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,630
'Here I go, getting married
to the milky brat’'

871
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,590
They conned me into it.

872
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:38,960
‘Meow Meow says the cat?’

873
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,130
'Here I go, getting married
to the milky brat?’

874
00:58:43,550 --> 00:58:45,920
Wow!

875
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:48,760
Such drama! Never before! Ever after!

876
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,760
Get her married to that Puff, sir.
Holy thread is also ready.

877
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,300
I will do it. I will do it right now.

878
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,170
Will you get her married in the train?

879
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:55,920
We shall host the wedding
in Kurnool only.

880
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,550
Let's go, dear.
-Okay, mom.

881
00:58:58,420 --> 00:58:59,960
Wish him good night.
-Drama queens, I must admit.

882
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,420
Good night!
-Go away!

883
00:59:02,950 --> 00:59:03,620
- Let's go.
- Go.

884
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,620
Tie them up, sir.

885
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,920
Good idea. Good idea.

886
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,080
Move!

887
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,540
Is our girl safe, brother-in-law?
- Yes, please come.

888
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,120
- What's this nuisance at midnight?
- Do you want to eat Puff?

889
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,810
Buffoon!

890
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:20,300
These dhotis are not safe at all.

891
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,520
Especially at nights in these trains.

892
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,360
Dhotis are not safe for men anymore.

893
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:29,760
Bah!

894
00:59:29,890 --> 00:59:33,100
I’m having nightmares about someone
strangling me and stabbing me with swords.

895
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:35,470
- Who is it?
- You, sir.

896
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:38,010
Why would I stab you, son?

897
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:39,790
But you just did.

898
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,800
Want an apple?

899
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,640
Pomegranate?

900
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,890
Anything less than blood
wouldn’t interest you.

901
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:51,100
You’ve been doing this
since 12:30 at midnight.

902
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:54,680
It’s 5 am now.
Why don’t you go to sleep?

903
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,390
So that you can stab me again?

904
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,450
Mom! I want him!

905
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:08,190
Do you get it?

906
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:15,200
Let’s go to his compartment and look.
Come on!

907
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:23,000
Oh my god!

908
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,540
He’ll die. He’ll die.

909
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,780
Are you out of your minds?
How could you strangle your father?

910
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:31,610
Where was your mind at?

911
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,690
We suggested you to tie her up.

912
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:35,800
You should’ve held on to the rope
with your hands.

913
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,100
Why would you tie it around your neck?

914
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:39,450
I was holding on to it with my hands only
last night.

915
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,310
He was snoring all night.
So we tied the rope to his neck.

916
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,080
Do you get it?

917
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,430
Generally, people are hanged
when they commit murders.

918
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:54,290
But you hanged him for snoring?!

919
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,980
I can’t believe I prayed so hard
for my daughter.

920
01:00:58,770 --> 01:01:00,570
Just stopped your snoring.

921
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,220
You should’ve stopped my breath.
That would make you happy, right?

922
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,760
- She would be happy I’m sure.
- Oh no!

923
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:07,610
These ropes can’t hold them, sir.

924
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,160
Tie them in chains.

925
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,390
- Mr. Prasad...
- Hey... Give me those chains.

926
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,260
What if he ran away?

927
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:14,500
He’s an old man. No chance!

928
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,280
If he sprints...

929
01:01:16,470 --> 01:01:19,400
...he’ll die from shortage of breath before
he makes it to the end of the compartment.

930
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:23,260
See?
Give me those chains. Come on.

931
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:28,980
Greetings...

932
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:34,320
Old man turned out to be Bolt.

933
01:01:34,910 --> 01:01:36,570
They grew up eating healthy food.

934
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,130
- Of course he’d be fit.
- But this is extreme.

935
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,080
Hey! Where are you going?

936
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,420
AC compartment isn’t safe for us.
Let’s go to the General Compartment.

937
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:50,550
- We’ll sweat there.
- We’ll lose our dignity here.

938
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,810
Father!!

939
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:56,870
These iron chains and train compartments...
None of these can stop me.

940
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,350
A man will come to make my love triumph.

941
01:02:05,310 --> 01:02:07,400
- Yakubu...
- Brother!

942
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:09,420
Did you check the entire train?

943
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:13,040
The AC compartment is
glittering with gold, boss.

944
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,620
What are we waiting for?

945
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,400
- Let’s rob it.
- Okay, boss.

946
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:18,820
Weapons out!

947
01:02:21,310 --> 01:02:24,480
- Please avoid this.
- It’s a 7’o clock blade, boss.

948
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,350
I know it!

949
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,920
I have lost so much
because of that blade.

950
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,020
Let's go.
- Give me the money.

951
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:34,450
- Leave it!
- Give me some of it.

952
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,350
Why do you need gold?

953
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:39,630
You are an orphan.
Why do you need gold?

954
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,300
One day even I will have a family...

955
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,810
- I will loot everything.
- I don’t think so.

956
01:02:46,810 --> 01:02:49,440
- Take it out. Quick!
- Come, brother.

957
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,690
My bangles, necklace, mom's
and sisters' gold...

958
01:02:52,730 --> 01:02:54,480
It's pure gold. Loot it.

959
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:57,770
- What did you say?
- Brother, do you get it?

960
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:59,020
- Yakub.
- Brother...

961
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,480
[STAMMERING]

962
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:01,940
I found a sister.

963
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:04,940
You look exactly like my son who
went missing at a carnival.

964
01:03:05,480 --> 01:03:07,020
Can I call you as my ‘Son’?

965
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:08,440
Kathi...!

966
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:12,060
I also found a mother.

967
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:15,440
What's with these chains?
Why are you being tortured?

968
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:17,400
Tell me, sister.

969
01:03:22,850 --> 01:03:26,020
Sister, freshen up and come
to brother-in-law's home.

970
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:27,900
I’ll get you two married.

971
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,310
Wow! You’re such a good thief.

972
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,600
Never before! Ever after!

973
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,940
- Hey! Hey!
-Move!

974
01:03:38,350 --> 01:03:39,440
Boss...

975
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:40,810
Hey, Boss...

976
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,940
What?

977
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:43,400
Come and tie the holy thread..

978
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:44,940
You creep!
Why would I tie a holy thread to you?

979
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:47,940
You shouldn’t tie the holy thread
to this loser. I mean my brother.

980
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:48,940
But to this girl.

981
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:50,600
To my little girl, boss.

982
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,100
Your little girl? Who’s that?

983
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,520
Oh no! She’s back again.

984
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,440
She bounces right back into
my life just like a ball.

985
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:01,940
What’s your relation with her?

986
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:04,480
We were dacoits until a few minutes ago.

987
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:07,690
Now we have become slaves to
this little girl’s love.

988
01:04:08,350 --> 01:04:10,520
We’ll be your brother-in-laws
if you marry her.

989
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:12,560
You’re calling her your little girl?

990
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:14,190
She’s the evil girl who
cheated her father.

991
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,850
All you see is the cheating part.

992
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:18,400
But we see her dating you.

993
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,350
If you saw what she did last night...
You wouldn’t rhyme so much.

994
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,600
She manipulated everyone into
forcing me into marrying her.

995
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,650
All you see is her criminal side.

996
01:04:25,850 --> 01:04:27,650
But I see her love for you.

997
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:30,270
Dang it! He just doesn’t stop?
- Yeah.

998
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,770
They motivated him so much.

999
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,770
She must have said some slogan too.

1000
01:04:33,850 --> 01:04:38,020
"Cock-a-doodle-do says the hen
She's getting married to this cute man"

1001
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:41,310
- Boss...
- Wait. Don’t touch me.

1002
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,230
There are 5 tunnels coming up.

1003
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,520
You should tie the holy thread
when we pass by the first.

1004
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:50,730
If you don’t, I’m going to smack you
when we pass the second.

1005
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:52,310
Thank you. Thank you.

1006
01:04:52,350 --> 01:04:54,400
You’ll be tying the three
knots in the third tunnel.

1007
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:56,810
We'll bless you in the fourth tunnel.

1008
01:04:57,150 --> 01:04:58,730
And we’ll be out of here
when we pass the fifth.

1009
01:04:58,810 --> 01:05:01,600
Let me give it to you, man.
This tunnel concept is amazing.

1010
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:04,350
You designed it pretty well.
Let’s make the most of it.

1011
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:07,730
- I have some advice for you.
- I never take men’s advice.

1012
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:09,850
Let's wait for the tunnels.

1013
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,690
By the end of the first tunnel,

1014
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:37,150
Independent candidate Ajay has
1000 votes majority over Ganesh.

1015
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:39,310
Just a 1000 votes majority?

1016
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:42,230
I’ll make sure to sweep you
out clean in the next tunnel.

1017
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,730
Sister... He wants to sweep me out clean.

1018
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:57,520
Sister, say there will be no marriage.

1019
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:00,230
He’s thrashing me in the dark.

1020
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:07,560
We will now be entering the longest tunnel
in South Central Railway Line.

1021
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,060
Which translates to the
biggest constituency.

1022
01:06:10,350 --> 01:06:12,650
I’ll get the maximum votes.
I'll start rigging.

1023
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:14,730
You’ll be surprised with my majority.

1024
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:19,270
This rigging is damn painful.

1025
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,230
Balot boxes are getting smashed.

1026
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,350
You swept him out clean
just like you said.

1027
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:30,230
Sister...

1028
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,560
Don't you feel sorry?

1029
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,350
Boys look like they're going to die.

1030
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,730
Tell them you don’t want
the wedding.

1031
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:40,350
A sculptor’s rasp transforms rock
into a sculpture.

1032
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,020
- You can fight this through.
- - Stop it!

1033
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:45,270
You and your bloody speeches!
Will you die if you don't get married?

1034
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:46,650
Won't you find someone else?

1035
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:48,940
You called me your brother.

1036
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,560
Tell them you don’t want this wedding.

1037
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,400
Who said you’re my brother?
You’re a thief.

1038
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,190
Sister!

1039
01:06:55,810 --> 01:06:57,310
What's going on, boss?

1040
01:06:57,650 --> 01:07:00,270
She just betrayed you, boss.

1041
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:03,850
Ah, your cunningness,
manipulation and cruelty...

1042
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:04,940
Take a bow!

1043
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:09,940
Boss, save us from them.

1044
01:07:10,190 --> 01:07:12,350
Make this decision as our leader.

1045
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:15,350
Why? Won't you make it
as members of the party?

1046
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,150
What do you want us to do, my lord?

1047
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:19,190
You've snatched many chains for money.

1048
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,690
Can't you pull one more
chain to save your lives?

1049
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:22,810
Oh!

1050
01:07:23,190 --> 01:07:25,190
Even the iron chain looks like gold.

1051
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:27,190
Pull it, guys!

1052
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:33,810
Let's catch a lorry to Kurnool, Mr. Prasad.
-Sure.

1053
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:53,560
"Wow! He’s co cute!"

1054
01:07:53,650 --> 01:07:56,230
"Wow! He’s so cute!"

1055
01:07:56,230 --> 01:07:59,730
"He’s so tall like a tower"

1056
01:07:59,850 --> 01:08:02,350
"He’s so tall!"

1057
01:08:02,350 --> 01:08:05,520
"He must’ve jumped out of Aladdin’s lamp"

1058
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:08,230
"He makes me go mad for him"

1059
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:11,520
"His cheeks are like Shimla apples"

1060
01:08:11,690 --> 01:08:14,480
"I want to grab one and bite into it"

1061
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:17,810
"He has a bullet hidden in his eyes"

1062
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:20,350
"His glances shoot right at me"

1063
01:08:20,940 --> 01:08:23,650
"He’s so cute! He’s so sweet!"

1064
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:26,150
"He’s so handsome!"

1065
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:29,850
"He’s so cool! He’s so hot!"

1066
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:32,520
"He’s just awesome!"

1067
01:08:48,650 --> 01:08:52,020
"Like a vulture preying on a chicken"

1068
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:55,190
"Like a crane snatching a fish"

1069
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:58,350
"Like a thief robbing the treasure"

1070
01:08:58,350 --> 01:09:01,440
"I have to keep him locked in my heart"

1071
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:07,690
"When he’s by my side,
all the women are jealous of me"

1072
01:09:07,850 --> 01:09:10,980
"His words are like an explosion"

1073
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:13,900
"His hotness just keeps me hooked"

1074
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,770
"He’s so cute! He’s so sweet!"

1075
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:19,190
"He's so handsome!"

1076
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:22,810
"He’s so cool! He’s so hot!"

1077
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:26,400
"He's just awesome!"

1078
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:35,730
"Who is your husband?"

1079
01:09:38,730 --> 01:09:42,350
"The one whose cheeks are red"

1080
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:03,730
"I give him a coffee with
a kiss in the morning"

1081
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:06,900
"I serve him lunch with a hug in the noon"

1082
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,060
"And at night, on the bed..."

1083
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,060
"Hey, girl!"

1084
01:10:10,150 --> 01:10:13,060
"I’ll serve dinner with bread and jam"

1085
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:16,230
"I don't want any sarees or jewels"

1086
01:10:16,270 --> 01:10:19,270
"I want to be his child’s mother"

1087
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,400
"There’s no song ever
made on a guy’s looks"

1088
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,520
"The word handsome falls
short to describe him"

1089
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,440
"He’s so cute! He’s so sweet!"

1090
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,940
"He's so handsome!"

1091
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,770
"He’s so cool! He’s so hot!"

1092
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:37,270
"He's just awesome."

1093
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:40,980
"He’s so cute! He’s so sweet!"

1094
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:43,190
"He's so handsome."

1095
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:46,980
"He’s so cool! He’s so hot!"

1096
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:49,730
"He's just awesome!"

1097
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,190
We fell into the bushes and
escaped because it was a forest.

1098
01:11:02,230 --> 01:11:03,690
- Otherwise...
- Yes.

1099
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:10,480
What happened here?

1100
01:11:12,980 --> 01:11:14,770
The house is locked.

1101
01:11:16,150 --> 01:11:17,850
They must’ve gone out on
some wedding chores.

1102
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:20,600
This whole image doesn’t give me
wedding vibes, Mr. Prasad.

1103
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,560
Hello.

1104
01:11:24,270 --> 01:11:26,600
Professor Ms. Bharathi should be
in this house, right?

1105
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:30,020
I don’t know, sir.

1106
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:33,850
Let’s visit the college she works in.

1107
01:11:35,560 --> 01:11:36,810
Professor Bharathi?

1108
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:40,270
Ma'am has been suspended four days ago.
We don’t know what happened after that.

1109
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:44,060
She is in very big trouble.

1110
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,400
Give me three plates idli.

1111
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,400
Gayatri, get up.

1112
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,400
How long do we have to keep
running away, mom?

1113
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:21,310
Let’s leave this place for good.

1114
01:12:23,770 --> 01:12:26,310
Are they going to kill us?

1115
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:31,980
First have your food.

1116
01:12:46,100 --> 01:12:47,020
Let's go.

1117
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,230
We searched the whole place…
We couldn’t find them, brother.

1118
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:13,560
Someone tipped us the wrong information.

1119
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:05,520
Brother...

1120
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:11,560
Let’s go.

1121
01:14:14,020 --> 01:14:15,190
Mom...

1122
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,230
People usually use photo frames of Gods
for worship.

1123
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:31,730
Why do you want me to do
it with this boy, sir?

1124
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:34,100
- Because he’s God to me.
- I can’t do it, sir.

1125
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:37,350
Lay this priest down,
slit his throat and...

1126
01:14:37,770 --> 01:14:40,400
- Father, have your food.
- Forgive me sir.

1127
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,520
- Oh no!
- Hey!

1128
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,060
Stop!

1129
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:45,650
You taught me kids are a reflection of God.

1130
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,480
Where’s that God now?
He ran away.

1131
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:49,440
None of your teachings ever came true.

1132
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,440
Do you ever go home
or going to die here.

1133
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,190
Did you find the Professor?

1134
01:14:58,440 --> 01:15:00,150
No, brother. We’ve been
looking for her everyday.

1135
01:15:00,190 --> 01:15:01,650
- We’ll find her soon.
- You looked for her everyday?

1136
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:04,730
- Did you go home?
- Yes, brother.

1137
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,600
- What about your wife and kids?
- They’re doing well.

1138
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:09,400
Did you take flowers for your wife?

1139
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,310
- Give me your phone.
- Brother…

1140
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:15,520
Come on.

1141
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:16,900
Sit down with me.

1142
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,650
If one Sitaramaraju dies,
millions of them will rise up.

1143
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:26,310
Each one of them will go raring
like a revolutionary leader...

1144
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:28,400
And destroy the British Empire
from the foundations up.

1145
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:30,350
Sitaramaraju is not just a man.

1146
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,480
He is an emblem of power.
He is a chivalrous warrior.

1147
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,440
Don’t shoot there. Shoot here.

1148
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,350
Who is he?

1149
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:42,230
Alluri Sitaramaraju.

1150
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,810
What do you see in him?

1151
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:47,310
- Bravery!
- Psst!

1152
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:49,810
Aggression!

1153
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:53,900
Chivalry!

1154
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:58,230
There are people surrounding him.
With guns in their hands.

1155
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:59,770
But he’s standing alone.

1156
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:02,440
With no weapon in his hand.

1157
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:04,940
Look at the way he’s standing...
With his chest out.

1158
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:09,480
Chivalry doesn’t mean sleeping
with your wife.

1159
01:16:10,810 --> 01:16:14,850
You must stand by the people
who trust you. That’s chivalry.

1160
01:16:16,060 --> 01:16:17,310
Do you have that in you?

1161
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:23,560
If you have guts, go kill her
and prove your masculinity.

1162
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,940
- Open camera 2
- Okay, sir.

1163
01:16:42,230 --> 01:16:45,060
I’ve checked a week’s footage, sir.
She hasn’t been to our depot.

1164
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:47,400
She didn’t go to the railway station
or the bus stand.

1165
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:49,400
She must be in this city.

1166
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:54,520
It doesn’t matter who came first,
Its all about who won at the end, Mr Judge.

1167
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,270
That matters at the end.

1168
01:16:55,310 --> 01:16:57,060
- Truly you are a gutsy man.
- Yes.

1169
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,060
Excuse me.

1170
01:16:58,350 --> 01:17:00,560
Professor Bharathi and
her family are missing.

1171
01:17:00,940 --> 01:17:02,440
Could you please enquire?

1172
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:03,770
What did the Judge say next?

1173
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:05,600
- He said, ‘Get out of my court!’
- Oh my!

1174
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:07,600
Why don’t you pay attention?
This is serious.

1175
01:17:09,190 --> 01:17:10,770
He must be new to Kurnool.

1176
01:17:10,850 --> 01:17:13,980
- When have you ever done your job, bro?
- Like you have.

1177
01:17:14,310 --> 01:17:15,770
Go to that corner,
give your report and leave.

1178
01:17:15,850 --> 01:17:18,020
We’ll look for her when we’re free.
What did the Judge say next?

1179
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:21,520
What did judge say? His mind was blocked.
-How can they be so irresponsible?

1180
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,440
Sir, CI has never been the dutiful one.

1181
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,440
A guy just filed a complaint about
the woman you mentioned.

1182
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,270
- Who is he?
- There he is. He’s leaving.

1183
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:30,100
Hey!

1184
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,600
Two cups of tea, please.

1185
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,150
Do you know Professor Bharathi?

1186
01:17:49,230 --> 01:17:52,440
Bharathi ma’am? She’s my tutor.

1187
01:17:52,690 --> 01:17:55,100
Even I haven’t seen her in a week.

1188
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,230
Let’s go there.

1189
01:18:05,150 --> 01:18:06,940
You stay here... I’ll be right back.

1190
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:17,650
Ma’am, vehicle AP 21 FR 3456 is
waiting at the end of that lane.

1191
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:20,020
That driver will take you to
Hyderabad safely. -Okay. Okay.

1192
01:18:42,690 --> 01:18:44,310
Excuse me… There were three kids
standing here. Where did they go?

1193
01:18:44,350 --> 01:18:45,600
I haven’t seen them, ma’am.

1194
01:18:56,810 --> 01:18:58,150
Sir...

1195
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:02,560
Sir...

1196
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:07,730
Sir...

1197
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:27,020
Gayatri...

1198
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,150
Gayatri...

1199
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:50,440
Hey, Bharathi!

1200
01:19:51,310 --> 01:19:53,560
I know you’re somewhere around here.

1201
01:19:54,980 --> 01:19:56,310
You better come out.

1202
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:58,900
I’ll kill them otherwise.

1203
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:02,850
Kids are crying.

1204
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:05,230
Why don’t you show yourself,
at least for their sake?

1205
01:20:05,980 --> 01:20:07,060
Come out!

1206
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:27,980
Basava!

1207
01:21:11,190 --> 01:21:13,520
Hey! Who the hell are you?

1208
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:21,480
Seena...

1209
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:24,560
I promised God I'd sever her head.

1210
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,060
Go!

1211
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,980
Don’t worry... You’ll be fine.

1212
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:32,900
Your son and I are working
in the same regiment.

1213
01:21:33,190 --> 01:21:34,690
My name is also Ajay.

1214
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:38,020
He has already applied for leave.

1215
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,230
Right before coming home,
he was sent on an urgent mission.

1216
01:21:41,690 --> 01:21:43,060
He’ll be home for the wedding.

1217
01:21:45,190 --> 01:21:46,980
You doesn’t need to worry about anything.

1218
01:21:47,480 --> 01:21:49,060
Mr. Prasad and I are here
for you till then.

1219
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:51,190
We’ll look after all the wedding
arrangements.

1220
01:21:52,100 --> 01:21:53,270
Everything will go according to plan.

1221
01:21:53,310 --> 01:21:54,480
You have nothing to worry about.

1222
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,480
Hey! Who the hell are you?

1223
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:57,730
Hey!

1224
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:03,480
I'm in middle of a conversation.

1225
01:22:34,730 --> 01:22:37,100
I said I’m in the middle of conversation.

1226
01:22:39,650 --> 01:22:41,600
Thank god we spend most of our
time in Kashmir, Mr.Prasad.

1227
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:44,770
Temperature is soaring here.
Give me a water bottle.

1228
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:46,150
Here you go.

1229
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:55,440
Come on, ma'am.
It's okay. Have some water.

1230
01:22:58,100 --> 01:22:59,900
I have to admit this place is great.

1231
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:01,270
We need to start the wedding
shopping from here.

1232
01:23:01,480 --> 01:23:02,650
What’s the name of this center?

1233
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:05,520
- Konda Reddy Fort.
- That’s a powerful name.

1234
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,560
This place is also lucky for you.

1235
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:10,440
Mom...

1236
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,400
Hey! Are you still worried?

1237
01:23:12,690 --> 01:23:13,900
You’ll calm down now.

1238
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:01,060
Hey!

1239
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:12,810
Have some coconut water.

1240
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:14,400
Don’t strain yourself.

1241
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:18,690
We’ll take care of the decorations,
catering, invites, hospitality, etc.

1242
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:20,980
If guys like them
intervene in between...

1243
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:25,770
We will offer them the best hospitality and
make sure we don't fall short anywhere.

1244
01:24:51,190 --> 01:24:54,310
Where the hell did you come from?
You’re going to die here.

1245
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:55,980
Leave them and go.

1246
01:24:56,270 --> 01:24:59,690
Who should leave whom? Huh?

1247
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:05,190
You’ve tried to kill me
in every possible way.

1248
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,810
You attacked me in hundreds yet,
I didn’t even break a sweat.

1249
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,350
You need to leave me alone.

1250
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:20,900
Only someone scared proposes
a compromise.

1251
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,730
I don’t encourage any compromises!

1252
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:34,560
Don’t worry.

1253
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,100
I’m here purely to talk.

1254
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:39,520
Actually, I need to kill you
for what you’ve done.

1255
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,940
In fact, it’s quite easy for me
to kill you. But this is hard.

1256
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:45,400
I live to protect your lives.

1257
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:47,270
How can I kill you?

1258
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:49,650
We sacrifice our lives for you
at the border.

1259
01:26:49,690 --> 01:26:51,400
But you’re out here attacking women.

1260
01:26:51,650 --> 01:26:53,100
Aren’t you supposed to be responsible?

1261
01:26:54,400 --> 01:27:00,190
I've caused a lot of mayhem before I even
knew who you are or who sent you here.

1262
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,100
But I will find out soon.

1263
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:05,600
I’ll find out who’s behind this and
why you want to kill her so badly.

1264
01:27:05,850 --> 01:27:07,850
And when I do, I won’t be sparing you.

1265
01:27:09,100 --> 01:27:11,310
Things are definitely
going to be worse then.

1266
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,310
I’m giving you a small break.

1267
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:17,190
After the break, this is going to be huge.

1268
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:46,180
Make sure there's a large
crowd at tomorrow's meeting.

1269
01:27:46,180 --> 01:27:48,010
CM should know our capabilities…
- Okay, sir.

1270
01:27:50,390 --> 01:27:51,720
Make all arrangements.

1271
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:02,010
Is there fog in the daytime in Kurnool
that you are shivering so much?

1272
01:28:03,930 --> 01:28:05,600
Bro, do you have a phone?

1273
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:11,800
When one Sitarama Raju dies lakhs of such
Sitarama rajus will be born.

1274
01:28:11,850 --> 01:28:14,760
Each one of them will be a valiant
revolutionary and they will attack

1275
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,550
the foundation of the British empire.

1276
01:28:16,550 --> 01:28:18,140
Sitaramaraju is not just a man.

1277
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,050
He's a mega power.
Not there.

1278
01:28:20,220 --> 01:28:22,100
Shoot here. Come on!

1279
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:28,470
Who is he, brother?
-Alluri Sitaramaraju.

1280
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:35,430
I saw Alluri Sitarama Raju
near Kurnool Kondareddy Fort.

1281
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,640
50 people surrounding him.

1282
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,470
No sword

1283
01:28:48,930 --> 01:28:49,930
…or axe in hand.

1284
01:28:50,050 --> 01:28:54,470
He stood so majestically just like him.

1285
01:28:57,550 --> 01:29:04,140
You'd rather wish for death than
take his beatings, brother.

1286
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:13,430
When he's on a hitting streak, you're
bound to back off. Like I did.

1287
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:24,550
After seeing Bharathi, I
prayed to the Goddess..

1288
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:27,100
That I will offer her head.

1289
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:32,050
After seeing him I prayed
to Lord Venkanna today.

1290
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:35,930
It would be more than
enough to stay alive.

1291
01:29:41,100 --> 01:29:42,600
I was humiliated at the Kurnool centre.

1292
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,930
I will not go home, I will stay here.

1293
01:29:45,390 --> 01:29:47,640
I feel like placing my head under
a truck when I hear it honk.

1294
01:29:48,970 --> 01:29:51,430
I feel like jumping in front of
a train when I hear it rattle.

1295
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:54,180
I will not go home. Look.

1296
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,720
I will sit in this corner only.

1297
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:58,140
You will feed me right?

1298
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:07,180
Near the fort, Sitarama Raju
said he'll come to you.

1299
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:10,600
Why are you singing while sitting
in the corner?

1300
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:15,640
Lay him down and slit his throat...
-Father...!

1301
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:17,430
After tomorrows meeting,

1302
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:22,600
We shall see that man and his manliness.

1303
01:30:32,350 --> 01:30:35,300
I’ve always condemned the wrongdoings…

1304
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:41,390
For the first time in my life
I had to support the wrongdoings.

1305
01:30:44,350 --> 01:30:45,550
Bharathi...

1306
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:52,100
Why did he feel the urge
to attempt suicide?

1307
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:54,220
Even I don’t understand.

1308
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,220
Uncle.

1309
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:10,510
In an auspicious occasion,
why are you giving with left hand?

1310
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:12,850
It’s ok uncle he is anyway left handed…

1311
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,850
Give me the reports.

1312
01:31:21,800 --> 01:31:24,100
How can you declare Ravi’s
death as suicide, sir?

1313
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:27,100
Can’t you see? He slit
his hand and died.

1314
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:34,850
How can a left-handed person cut a four
inches deep gash with his right hand, doctor?

1315
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:37,510
Who is behind this?

1316
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,010
Why are you asking me that?

1317
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,800
Go register a complaint in police station.

1318
01:31:41,180 --> 01:31:43,800
Sir, It’s definitely not
suicide it is murder.

1319
01:31:44,180 --> 01:31:45,720
Investigate immediately…

1320
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,850
Big shots must be involved in this case.

1321
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:50,930
You and me belong to middle class
why should we take risk?

1322
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:53,640
Okay, give my complaint back.
I will go.

1323
01:31:55,470 --> 01:31:59,350
Ladies listen to us so well

1324
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,300
I am going to meet your senior officer.

1325
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:06,800
These ladies are so stubborn they will
stretch the matter to its limits

1326
01:32:06,970 --> 01:32:08,510
Give me the complaint.

1327
01:32:09,470 --> 01:32:12,010
What would you like to have?
Coffee or tea?

1328
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,100
Clarity!

1329
01:32:13,470 --> 01:32:16,140
Clarity on why you wanted to see me.

1330
01:32:16,470 --> 01:32:19,510
You're a Professor, right?
You come to the point directly.

1331
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:23,350
You're a Politician, right?
You beat around the bush.

1332
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:27,390
You registered a complaint in the police
station that it is not suicide but murder,

1333
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:28,680
take back the complaint.

1334
01:32:28,970 --> 01:32:31,300
- Does that mean you are behind this?
- It’s me.

1335
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:34,510
I’ve committed a big crime, leave it.

1336
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:38,180
I always stand for the righteousness.
I don't justify any wrongdoing.

1337
01:32:38,260 --> 01:32:40,140
I am also like that...

1338
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:43,100
I make sure everyone accepts
my wrongdoings.

1339
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,390
I am giving you 24 hours…

1340
01:32:47,850 --> 01:32:51,140
Take back the complaint
and apologize to me…

1341
01:32:51,930 --> 01:32:56,510
Otherwise, the very next second I
will show you what I am capable of.

1342
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,970
I did not withdraw the complaint.

1343
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:01,890
And the minister started using
his influence upon me.

1344
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:05,350
They alleged me of leaking exam papers

1345
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:09,430
He got me suspended and
hurt my self-respect.

1346
01:33:14,220 --> 01:33:17,050
He has humiliated my girls in public...

1347
01:33:17,350 --> 01:33:21,140
He sent police to our home in the midnight
And framed us in a drug case.

1348
01:33:21,510 --> 01:33:24,510
He had also filed several other
cases on us…

1349
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:26,850
And ruined our reputation.

1350
01:33:27,390 --> 01:33:31,100
He threatened the groom's family
and got the wedding cancelled.

1351
01:33:31,640 --> 01:33:33,850
He ruined my daughter's future.

1352
01:33:34,890 --> 01:33:37,680
For pointing out Minister's mistake...

1353
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:43,100
He wrecked me and my
family in just 24 hours.

1354
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:45,300
We didn't have to go through this, mom.

1355
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:48,300
We were such a happy family.

1356
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:50,800
We don’t need all this….

1357
01:33:51,100 --> 01:33:53,050
Do something. Please.

1358
01:34:00,850 --> 01:34:04,050
Sir, I have come to withdraw
my complaint give it to me.

1359
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:08,430
Ladies are so timid
they are scared easily.

1360
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:10,470
Thank you, sir.

1361
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,800
I withdrew my complaint sir.

1362
01:34:13,850 --> 01:34:16,850
Master if I was late to class,
how would you punish me?

1363
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:18,470
I would make you stand under the sun.

1364
01:34:18,510 --> 01:34:20,430
She is late, right?
Ask her to stand under the sun.

1365
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:22,720
Sir, please sir…
-Sorry, ma'am.

1366
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:04,550
I have withdrawn the complaint

1367
01:35:04,680 --> 01:35:06,350
Please spare me and my children,

1368
01:35:06,970 --> 01:35:08,100
we will not mess with you.

1369
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:09,600
I am sorry.

1370
01:35:11,300 --> 01:35:14,140
If students make a mistake
in college, scold them...

1371
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:15,970
You have that power …

1372
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:18,850
But if the mistake is in society,
how are you concerned, huh?

1373
01:35:19,260 --> 01:35:21,050
That power is with me.

1374
01:35:23,100 --> 01:35:25,430
I heard that you have sent
both of your sons to the army.

1375
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:29,180
One is already dead and there is
no guarantee about the other son.

1376
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:37,260
Now…you and your house needs a man.

1377
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:42,640
Honest people like you will be scared
only for the moment…

1378
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:45,050
I won’t let it turn in to courage.

1379
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:46,800
Your game is over.

1380
01:35:46,930 --> 01:35:48,220
Kill her.

1381
01:36:00,720 --> 01:36:04,180
I don’t have answers for two questions.

1382
01:36:05,550 --> 01:36:10,640
My daughter asked why we were running
without committing any mistake.

1383
01:36:11,800 --> 01:36:13,600
I don’t have an answer…

1384
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:19,800
I’ve sent my two sons to the border
to protect these people, right?

1385
01:36:21,050 --> 01:36:22,140
But now…

1386
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:28,640
When the Minister said it would me
nice if there is a man in your house…

1387
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:33,720
I had no answer.

1388
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:48,470
Feed the children and sleep well…

1389
01:36:51,050 --> 01:36:55,050
Within 24 hours you'll have
answers to all your questions.

1390
01:36:55,180 --> 01:36:58,010
- But what if something happens to you?
- If I was your son…

1391
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:01,600
Will you send him to fight the war
or make him sit at home?

1392
01:38:03,850 --> 01:38:05,930
Complaint on the minister again.

1393
01:38:06,470 --> 01:38:10,140
These ladies…
Don't give up easily…

1394
01:38:10,260 --> 01:38:11,220
What should I do now?

1395
01:38:11,430 --> 01:38:13,680
Reopen the case and draft a new FIR.

1396
01:38:13,890 --> 01:38:15,850
- If I refuse?
- He will make you write it.

1397
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:18,850
Oh,

1398
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:21,180
As if I am a small school kid...

1399
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:23,260
You're trying to scare
me to do my home work.

1400
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:25,430
He will make me write FIR, huh?

1401
01:38:25,680 --> 01:38:27,390
Try scaring me.

1402
01:38:33,390 --> 01:38:35,300
I'm not scared.

1403
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,640
Mr. Prasad, he is strong.
He's not getting scared at all.

1404
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:41,300
Will you do anything for money?

1405
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:42,930
Not at all!

1406
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:44,640
Will you get scared if you see a tiger?

1407
01:38:45,470 --> 01:38:48,720
Tiger…or its mother
or its grandmother...

1408
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:50,050
I will not get scared

1409
01:38:50,180 --> 01:38:54,220
These policemen are so stubborn,
they will not listen like this.

1410
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:03,600
Long back madam registered a
complaint which we closed

1411
01:39:03,640 --> 01:39:05,970
We are reopening it now.

1412
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:07,890
Good, how did you get those bruises?

1413
01:39:09,390 --> 01:39:11,640
I am personally investigating this case…

1414
01:39:11,760 --> 01:39:13,850
Good… How did you get those bruises?

1415
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:14,970
Narayana…

1416
01:39:15,010 --> 01:39:16,550
When we are discussing such
an important issue..

1417
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,260
Why are you interested in my bruises?

1418
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:20,680
There was an earthquake
in my police station…

1419
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:22,850
The furniture fell on me, so the bruises.

1420
01:39:22,850 --> 01:39:25,350
Good but when there is an earthquake
entire city is affected...

1421
01:39:25,390 --> 01:39:26,890
How come only your police station
is affected?

1422
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:29,850
Narayana it is not Dengue that
entire city will be affected.

1423
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:34,300
It's Mother Earth. Wherever she is
angry there we will have tremors.

1424
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:36,600
Nah! These don't look like
bruises you get from falling.

1425
01:39:36,640 --> 01:39:39,260
Seem like bruises from
getting beaten up badly.

1426
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,640
These press reporters…

1427
01:39:44,390 --> 01:39:46,760
What's our next destination, Mister?

1428
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:50,100
- Your friend lawyer Mrudanga Rao
- Thank you!

1429
01:39:59,850 --> 01:40:02,680
You should have called and
convinced your friend on the way

1430
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:05,600
With those feelings I send
a whatsapp message to him

1431
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:07,140
- What did he say?
- See

1432
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:08,390
Ask him to come.

1433
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:11,390
Hey! Ask him to come.
-He is very confident.

1434
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:13,140
You will anyhow destroy his confidence.

1435
01:40:14,970 --> 01:40:16,140
Oh my god!

1436
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:24,430
Seems like a river is flowing here.

1437
01:40:25,300 --> 01:40:26,970
Due to certain circumstances,

1438
01:40:27,140 --> 01:40:28,930
We have filed wrong
cases against madam.

1439
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:30,720
Good. Where did you get those bruises?

1440
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:34,300
If madam doesn't forgive me,
I will die from repentence.

1441
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:36,100
Good. What about the bruises?

1442
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:37,760
Narayana...

1443
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:41,010
He is saying he will die Narayana,
how can that be good?

1444
01:40:41,180 --> 01:40:43,300
Why are you always talking
about the bruises?

1445
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:46,510
...there was an earthquake in my
office and everything fell on me.

1446
01:40:46,510 --> 01:40:47,850
He already used that excuse.

1447
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:49,140
What should I use?

1448
01:40:49,350 --> 01:40:51,260
There is water on the ground.
So blame the tsunami.

1449
01:40:51,470 --> 01:40:54,760
Oh! There was a Tsunami
and everything fell on me.

1450
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,180
There is no water body in Kurnool.
How come there was a Tsunami?

1451
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:58,100
He means…

1452
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,260
There was an earthquake in the station
and due to its impact,

1453
01:41:00,260 --> 01:41:02,010
The water tank moved
and caused a Tsunami.

1454
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:05,970
Good, if the earthquake was there
how can Tsunami come here?

1455
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,970
Narayana, your father's
hometown is Alampur.

1456
01:41:09,140 --> 01:41:11,260
yours Kurnool. You have diabetes.

1457
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:12,470
And so does your father.

1458
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:15,220
how can the diabetes that
is in Anantapur come to Kurnool?

1459
01:41:15,300 --> 01:41:17,300
- That’s genes …
- This is science, sir.

1460
01:41:17,430 --> 01:41:19,140
Thank you, Mister!

1461
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:23,850
Sir...!!!

1462
01:41:25,390 --> 01:41:26,350
Whoa!

1463
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:28,260
Looks like principal is completely prepared
to compromise.

1464
01:41:28,430 --> 01:41:30,390
He understood him pretty well.

1465
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:33,550
Sir... Sir... I'm sorry madam.

1466
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,390
This is madam's rejoining letter.

1467
01:41:35,550 --> 01:41:37,220
You can come back to college
from tomorrow.

1468
01:41:51,660 --> 01:41:54,160
Sitarama Raju...

1469
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:02,250
Hey, stop... Who are you guys?

1470
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:05,250
Don’t you get it? Get out from here!
-I'm here to meet the Minister.

1471
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:08,870
Mr. Prasad, is anyone listening to you
since morning?

1472
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:12,790
- Can we go now.
- Go, sir.

1473
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,040
You are correct.

1474
01:42:14,250 --> 01:42:15,870
I have to talk to the minister. Call him.

1475
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,540
Can't you see that he is in a meeting?

1476
01:42:20,660 --> 01:42:22,200
I’ve to talk to him. Call him
and ask him to come here.

1477
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:24,330
Who are you?

1478
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:26,750
We are from seema… We feel the rage.

1479
01:42:26,870 --> 01:42:28,250
I will break your bones!

1480
01:42:28,290 --> 01:42:30,450
I will skin you!

1481
01:42:30,450 --> 01:42:33,160
I will lay you down and slit your throat.

1482
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:39,660
You are tall like a vase,
One punch and you will turn into a pot.

1483
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:48,660
A Vase turned into a Pot.

1484
01:42:52,500 --> 01:42:54,700
At this age, there is no chance
of you feeling the rage.

1485
01:42:55,290 --> 01:42:58,250
You have eaten well and become fat…

1486
01:42:58,540 --> 01:43:00,250
If that melts you will be in control….

1487
01:43:01,200 --> 01:43:03,950
From now on, you should be
doing something or the other.

1488
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:08,160
Or else, you will turn into a pot.

1489
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:15,870
Nagendra brother is the reason so many
people are gathered in Kurnool today.

1490
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:35,830
What timing, Mr. Prasad!

1491
01:43:35,870 --> 01:43:38,410
Here soldier has defeated the Minister.
Over there Minister has made an entry.

1492
01:43:38,450 --> 01:43:39,830
Positive sign, son.

1493
01:43:51,330 --> 01:43:55,080
He has come home for the first time.
Should I respectfully feed him?

1494
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:59,580
Or since he has come with my enemy,
should I kill him and bury him?

1495
01:44:00,540 --> 01:44:01,830
First option is better.

1496
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:05,450
Feed us tasty Ragi malt
and rustic chicken, We’ll happily eat it.

1497
01:44:05,910 --> 01:44:08,290
Second option is risky.
Don’t try that.

1498
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:11,000
You can take his review.

1499
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:16,330
Oh my God! Mr. Prasad, he has
given a block buster review.

1500
01:44:16,410 --> 01:44:18,040
he has given 3.5 rating…

1501
01:44:18,500 --> 01:44:19,580
Listen to me and follow him.

1502
01:44:19,620 --> 01:44:22,370
Just because he hit 4 persons?

1503
01:44:22,370 --> 01:44:24,620
Not just 4. He hit 40 men.

1504
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:28,290
He can beat another 400 just in case.

1505
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:29,750
He is from the army after all.

1506
01:44:31,790 --> 01:44:33,450
You think I am your college student?

1507
01:44:33,660 --> 01:44:35,330
I am a State Minister.
Watch your words.

1508
01:44:35,620 --> 01:44:38,200
Hey! You think you're
a college student?

1509
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:40,620
You are a State Minister
and this is how you talk to ladies?

1510
01:44:47,250 --> 01:44:49,660
Do you realize where you
are who you're talking to?

1511
01:44:50,540 --> 01:44:53,290
100 of my persons are around…

1512
01:44:54,040 --> 01:44:57,580
If they beat you, can you
leave this threshold alive?

1513
01:44:58,950 --> 01:45:01,330
Is this threshold Pakistan border?

1514
01:45:01,330 --> 01:45:05,410
We jump over the border like it's a college
compound and kill people in bunches.

1515
01:45:08,410 --> 01:45:11,870
He heard about you but has
not seen you in action now.

1516
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:15,080
Show him so that he gets clarity.

1517
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:28,450
What did you say? He cannot
cross this compound alive?

1518
01:45:29,290 --> 01:45:30,830
He is surrounded by 100 men…

1519
01:45:31,040 --> 01:45:32,330
He is alone.

1520
01:45:32,830 --> 01:45:35,620
Touch him!
Would anyone dare to touch him?

1521
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:12,250
Hey, why are you guys backing off?
Are you scared?

1522
01:46:25,450 --> 01:46:26,950
- Oh no!
- What are those sounds coming from inside?

1523
01:46:26,950 --> 01:46:32,200
Thunders, bro. Arjuna, Phalghuna,
Partha, Kiriti, Krishna, Super star...

1524
01:46:56,120 --> 01:46:57,790
Is anyone else coming?

1525
01:47:00,160 --> 01:47:01,750
No.

1526
01:47:03,410 --> 01:47:06,500
Mr. Prasad, now the Minister
will pay attention to us.

1527
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:12,500
She told me everything.

1528
01:47:12,830 --> 01:47:14,950
Teasing girls…

1529
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:19,250
Making a Professor stand on the road…

1530
01:47:20,540 --> 01:47:22,200
After hearing all these…

1531
01:47:22,870 --> 01:47:27,200
I was so raged I wanted to load a gun and
empty the entire magazine in your body.

1532
01:47:28,580 --> 01:47:30,410
But how can I kill you?

1533
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,830
You are one of the lives I protect.

1534
01:47:32,950 --> 01:47:35,950
We sacrifice our lives for you at the border.
But you do all sorts of stupid things here.

1535
01:47:35,950 --> 01:47:37,120
Aren't you supposed to be responsible?

1536
01:47:40,040 --> 01:47:42,540
You're the life I'm
protecting with all my might.

1537
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:45,450
I don’t like the way you are behaving…
I don’t like it!

1538
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:48,370
I am giving you 48 hours…

1539
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:51,160
Admit your mistakes… Apologize to her…

1540
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:54,160
Go to jail and transform into
a responsible citizen…

1541
01:47:55,330 --> 01:48:00,700
If not, you will see what I'm
capable of in the next moment.

1542
01:48:02,370 --> 01:48:04,450
Boy, do you think he will change?

1543
01:48:04,580 --> 01:48:09,040
If he changes by listening to me,
Like these people change parties,

1544
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:10,330
it will be very easy...

1545
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:14,580
But if I need to change him,
it’s gonna be a tough ride for him.

1546
01:48:15,250 --> 01:48:18,500
Somewhat like a seven seater
taxi ride on a bumpy road.

1547
01:48:19,370 --> 01:48:22,080
dhad dhad dhad…

1548
01:48:22,870 --> 01:48:24,500
It will be terrible.

1549
01:48:25,450 --> 01:48:26,500
Son!

1550
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:27,620
Coffee!

1551
01:48:27,870 --> 01:48:30,160
Mr. Prasad …we just told him and
he changed in a snap…

1552
01:48:30,160 --> 01:48:32,910
your timing… your discipline…
your commitment…

1553
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:33,910
Take a bow!

1554
01:48:34,040 --> 01:48:36,750
Minister, take your father as
an inspiration and follow him.

1555
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,000
Bye sir.

1556
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:43,700
What? Here vases are turning into pots.

1557
01:48:45,370 --> 01:48:49,450
Now you and your house needs a man.

1558
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:10,370
If you face a similar
problem after engagement...

1559
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:12,540
She will not abandon you like you did.

1560
01:49:13,120 --> 01:49:15,410
She would’ve definitely stood for you.

1561
01:49:18,830 --> 01:49:22,200
if there is an issue with assets or
the girl, It’s a different problem…

1562
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:26,870
But refusing wedding just because you are
scared of someone is so unfair to the girl.

1563
01:49:28,120 --> 01:49:30,500
I can also instill fear in you. You will
show up at the wedding venue in minutes.

1564
01:49:30,580 --> 01:49:31,910
But that isn’t the solution, right?

1565
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:35,410
You should let the wedding happen for
the same reason you agreed to it.

1566
01:49:36,580 --> 01:49:38,870
Your son did not abandon us
like you abandoned us…

1567
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,870
He came to the station to find out
what happened to us…

1568
01:49:42,450 --> 01:49:44,000
That’s why we came all
the way to your house.

1569
01:49:45,200 --> 01:49:46,160
Let's go.

1570
01:49:53,370 --> 01:49:56,540
You've grown from a small time farmer
to a big time cotton seed businessman.

1571
01:49:56,950 --> 01:49:59,000
You must have taken many bold decisions.

1572
01:49:59,950 --> 01:50:02,200
It doesn’t make sense if that
courage is confined to the walls.

1573
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:18,000
"Our hearts is swinging in a cradle of joy"

1574
01:50:21,750 --> 01:50:25,330
"Our lips are adorned
with a beautiful smile"

1575
01:50:25,700 --> 01:50:32,370
"Are you the sun or the moon
or are you the combination two?"

1576
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:39,250
"Are you the charioteer or a bridge
or are you the breath of our dream?"

1577
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:47,040
"Entire world is filled with love
or are you a sage?"

1578
01:50:48,250 --> 01:50:54,290
"Are you the revolution bringing hope
to people around you?"

1579
01:50:55,500 --> 01:51:00,040
"Are you one amongst us?"

1580
01:51:00,830 --> 01:51:03,950
"Are you the sun or the moon?"

1581
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:07,040
"Are you a union of the two?"

1582
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:11,410
"Are you the torch
bearer or a saviour?"

1583
01:51:11,700 --> 01:51:14,830
"Are you our dream come true?"

1584
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:22,200
"Our hearts is swinging in a cradle of joy"

1585
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,750
Where do your parents live?

1586
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:27,080
I’m an orphan.

1587
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:50,040
Who's going to accept the offering?

1588
01:51:50,290 --> 01:51:51,660
My son Ajay will.

1589
01:51:51,790 --> 01:51:53,750
But you said your son Ajay isn't here.

1590
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:56,290
I meant this Ajay.

1591
01:51:58,410 --> 01:52:00,410
[chanting]

1592
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:25,080
"You heal the deepest
wounds of our hearts"

1593
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:32,580
"You're like the moonlight
on a summer night"

1594
01:52:32,950 --> 01:52:36,500
"You've crossed bridges to build hope"

1595
01:52:36,660 --> 01:52:40,120
"You stood by us in the darkest of times"

1596
01:52:40,330 --> 01:52:42,120
"You're our saving grace"

1597
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:48,540
"And we fall short of words to thank you"

1598
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:52,750
"Are you the sun or the moon?"

1599
01:52:53,290 --> 01:52:56,200
"Are you a union of the two?"

1600
01:52:56,950 --> 01:52:59,950
"Are you the torch bearer or a saviour?"

1601
01:53:00,620 --> 01:53:03,620
"Are you our dream come true?"

1602
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:09,410
- Hello.
- Hello.

1603
01:53:09,620 --> 01:53:12,290
Ajjay’s mission has been
extended unexpectedly.

1604
01:53:12,330 --> 01:53:14,330
At any cost, he will be here
for the wedding.

1605
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:18,910
Being there rather than here
is the right thing to do.

1606
01:53:28,290 --> 01:53:31,700
"Our hearts is swinging
in a cradle of joy"

1607
01:53:35,660 --> 01:53:39,540
"Our lips are adorned
with a beautiful smile"

1608
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:46,870
The soldier is so tiny. How can he
defeat the Minister who's so big?

1609
01:53:46,950 --> 01:53:49,950
Didn't the big vase become a small pot?

1610
01:53:51,580 --> 01:53:52,540
P.A...

1611
01:53:53,580 --> 01:53:55,450
Find out where this soldier is.

1612
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:58,790
The 48 hours that
he gave us are over.

1613
01:54:09,080 --> 01:54:12,620
Grandpa, why is the
Minister here at this time?

1614
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:16,790
Hey, Swami... Minister sir is coming.
Let's go.

1615
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:20,620
- Son.
- Take it.

1616
01:54:39,200 --> 01:54:40,620
Are you buying vegetables?

1617
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,750
The bitter gourd here is very good.

1618
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:48,080
You said you'll show me what you're capable
of if I don’t admit to my mistakes, right?

1619
01:54:48,330 --> 01:54:49,330
Show me.

1620
01:54:50,120 --> 01:54:50,870
Show me

1621
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:53,950
I'm the life you are protecting.
So it is your responsibility to change me.

1622
01:54:55,450 --> 01:54:59,750
If it's a stained shirt, you
can wash it off with soap.

1623
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:03,330
But it's the dirt that has been
on my body for the last 40 years.

1624
01:55:03,910 --> 01:55:06,500
How will you clean that?
How will you change that?

1625
01:55:10,290 --> 01:55:13,330
I committed a big crime.
I confessed to her as well.

1626
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:17,330
I only drew the line
and I only erased it.

1627
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:21,120
How will you show me my place?
How will you change me?

1628
01:55:23,870 --> 01:55:26,250
You had beaten my
people in this center.

1629
01:55:26,620 --> 01:55:28,410
You came home and beat my henchmen.

1630
01:55:28,660 --> 01:55:34,450
These people who are behind me
have come here out of love for me.

1631
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,950
My people are my strength.

1632
01:55:39,620 --> 01:55:41,250
How will you beat that?

1633
01:55:42,450 --> 01:55:44,200
You want to see that strength?

1634
01:55:45,370 --> 01:55:47,910
You want to see that strength?

1635
01:55:48,450 --> 01:55:49,700
Hey!

1636
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:53,790
What will you do if a
stranger hits your Minister?

1637
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,410
We’ll kill brutally by hunting him down.

1638
01:55:57,580 --> 01:56:00,950
We will behead him and wash
the sword in a river, brother.

1639
01:56:01,160 --> 01:56:05,950
If some random guy drags your leader
on to the streets, what will you do?

1640
01:56:05,950 --> 01:56:08,660
We will wash the soil of
our town with his blood.

1641
01:56:08,660 --> 01:56:12,330
Tell me where he is, brother. I'll hang
his severed head at the Konda Reddy Fort.

1642
01:56:12,370 --> 01:56:15,040
He’s here.

1643
01:56:15,290 --> 01:56:16,790
Come on!

1644
01:56:25,580 --> 01:56:27,040
This is my strength.

1645
01:56:27,540 --> 01:56:32,120
My people are my strength.
How will you beat that?

1646
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,250
Your people…your strength.

1647
01:56:40,450 --> 01:56:42,370
What’s the time, Mr. Prasad?

1648
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:43,950
7.30 sharp.

1649
01:56:43,950 --> 01:56:47,080
Oh no! Samantha is inaugurating a
store in the next street at 7.30.

1650
01:56:49,330 --> 01:56:51,080
- Is it the movie celebrity Samantha?
- Yes.

1651
01:56:51,200 --> 01:56:52,700
Samantha from 'Dookudu'?

1652
01:56:53,540 --> 01:56:55,620
[imitating Samantha] 'I'm sad.
I'm going to look upset.'

1653
01:56:55,700 --> 01:56:57,830
'I'm hurt!' that Samantha.

1654
01:56:57,870 --> 01:56:58,700
Yes.

1655
01:56:58,790 --> 01:57:01,250
Dhak dhak dhadak!!!

1656
01:57:14,620 --> 01:57:17,580
Some guy said he will hang me to the
Konda Reddy fort. Who was that?

1657
01:57:17,870 --> 01:57:19,330
He was the first one to run.

1658
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:21,040
Minister sir...

1659
01:57:22,830 --> 01:57:23,870
Come.

1660
01:57:25,370 --> 01:57:26,620
What happened?

1661
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,080
Sit down.

1662
01:57:29,870 --> 01:57:31,250
People are your strength, huh?

1663
01:57:31,450 --> 01:57:33,700
If we are smart, they're street smart.

1664
01:57:33,830 --> 01:57:36,200
They appear to be behind
us but they are not.

1665
01:57:37,080 --> 01:57:38,830
They will take sides according
to their convenience.

1666
01:57:39,410 --> 01:57:41,750
You showed them a faction movie.
They were in rage.

1667
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:44,500
I showed them a glamorous film.
They cooled down.

1668
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:47,370
Do you know what true strength is?

1669
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:51,620
I enter the battlefield without
fearing death. That is my strength.

1670
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:58,290
She goes to any extent to stop injustice.

1671
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:00,370
That is her strength…

1672
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Look. He's working hard for
his family since morning.

1673
01:58:08,700 --> 01:58:09,950
That is his strength.

1674
01:58:11,330 --> 01:58:13,790
Do you have a strength of your own?

1675
01:58:15,450 --> 01:58:17,540
Your power, your money, your people.

1676
01:58:17,700 --> 01:58:20,330
Leaving all this behind,
what is your true strength?

1677
01:58:20,370 --> 01:58:22,370
[COUGHS]

1678
01:58:24,830 --> 01:58:27,870
I was such a cool guy Mr. Prasad.
But ever since I came to Kurnool...

1679
01:58:28,330 --> 01:58:30,620
I can’t control my emotions.

1680
01:58:30,620 --> 01:58:32,450
Its the effect of this region.

1681
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:34,200
Is that true?

1682
01:58:34,250 --> 01:58:36,750
Yes, of course.
You are experiencing it right now.

1683
01:58:37,790 --> 01:58:38,910
What else did you say?

1684
01:58:39,410 --> 01:58:41,950
It's the dirt on the body
since the last 40 years, eh?

1685
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:45,830
Ladies will have better clarity on
this topic. How can we wash it off?

1686
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:51,000
Soak in hot water, wash, wring...

1687
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:53,040
And beat it against a stone.

1688
01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:55,040
All the age old dirt will
be washed away, right?

1689
01:58:55,790 --> 01:58:57,620
Cultured wash .

1690
01:58:57,910 --> 01:59:00,290
You wanted to see what I am?

1691
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:01,830
I will show you.

1692
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:05,160
You gave me an offer to transform
you into a responsible citizen, right?

1693
01:59:05,500 --> 01:59:07,250
Now I will exploit your offer.

1694
01:59:08,160 --> 01:59:10,080
I will rewrite the rules you've broken.

1695
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,580
I will change your fate.
I will expose your mistakes.

1696
01:59:12,580 --> 01:59:16,330
I will put you in jail and transform
you in to a responsible citizen.

1697
01:59:19,120 --> 01:59:20,660
Good rhyming, Mr. Prasad.

1698
01:59:20,660 --> 01:59:22,080
- See you soon.
- Me too.

1699
01:59:22,120 --> 01:59:23,700
Oh no! We are in full form.

1700
01:59:24,330 --> 01:59:25,540
Wish me all the best, Minister .

1701
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:27,410
Let's go buy that supposedly
good bitter gourd.

1702
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,290
lets buy a kilo cook and eat.

1703
01:59:33,290 --> 01:59:35,950
You said you'd expose his mistake.

1704
01:59:36,040 --> 01:59:39,290
It's a new place.
We need someone who can help us out.

1705
01:59:39,290 --> 01:59:40,580
I've called one of my friend's friend.

1706
01:59:40,620 --> 01:59:42,370
He's a Crime Branch Officer.

1707
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:45,330
No need, sir. We can crack it in an hour.

1708
01:59:45,370 --> 01:59:47,500
I think we should stick
to what we do best.

1709
01:59:47,620 --> 01:59:49,000
Trust me on this.

1710
01:59:49,410 --> 01:59:52,040
His intelligence is par...
-Who is he anyway, sir?

1711
01:59:52,160 --> 01:59:53,950
Crime Branch Koti!

1712
01:59:56,580 --> 01:59:59,040
Crime Branch Koti!
Epitome of Intelligence!

1713
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:01,200
I want to be your assistant, sir.

1714
02:00:01,290 --> 02:00:04,040
I sold my 10 acres land and
bribed you for 25 lakhs.

1715
02:00:04,040 --> 02:00:05,910
Don't call it bribe, Kishore. It's my fee.

1716
02:00:05,950 --> 02:00:08,540
You looted my money after all.
I will be a top officer like you, right?

1717
02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:09,620
Just follow me.

1718
02:00:09,660 --> 02:00:11,290
I will also retweet.

1719
02:00:11,410 --> 02:00:14,950
My nephew is coming. You've ruined
that alliance in the train, remember?

1720
02:00:15,080 --> 02:00:16,580
I will see how you will
break this alliance.

1721
02:00:16,580 --> 02:00:18,500
I'm done with my work.
I'll leave, madam.

1722
02:00:19,330 --> 02:00:20,120
Greetings.

1723
02:00:20,160 --> 02:00:22,120
I'm taking the left over rice.
-Wait.

1724
02:00:23,700 --> 02:00:26,290
Oh no! Let go, sir.
Sir, let go.

1725
02:00:26,290 --> 02:00:27,620
Does sir have weakness for women?

1726
02:00:30,830 --> 02:00:32,790
While we are here to
discuss your marriage...

1727
02:00:32,830 --> 02:00:34,410
You are getting touchy with the maid?!

1728
02:00:34,450 --> 02:00:36,000
Uncle, she is not the maid.
She is a thief.

1729
02:00:36,080 --> 02:00:37,700
- Wow!
- Cool buddy.

1730
02:00:37,870 --> 02:00:39,950
She has robbed half kilo gold
and is going away. -Forgive me, ma'am.

1731
02:00:39,950 --> 02:00:42,080
Ma'am, add salt to the lentils broth.

1732
02:00:42,450 --> 02:00:43,540
Hey... Durga!

1733
02:00:44,040 --> 02:00:45,370
How did you catch her?

1734
02:00:45,660 --> 02:00:47,410
She greeted me without
knowing who I am.

1735
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:49,580
She has responded without me
asking anything. That's it.

1736
02:00:49,620 --> 02:00:51,290
What a talent!

1737
02:00:51,330 --> 02:00:54,790
Every penny I spent on you
has been worth it, sir.

1738
02:00:54,910 --> 02:00:58,000
We are lucky to get such
an intelligent son-in-law.

1739
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:00,790
- Exactly!
- You better stop being so dramatic.

1740
02:01:01,160 --> 02:01:04,410
The information I got is that
she met someone in the train.

1741
02:01:05,580 --> 02:01:08,950
I can't marry her when she is
already in love with someone.

1742
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,910
Wow!

1743
02:01:11,080 --> 02:01:15,080
- A man with such clarity...
- Never before! Ever after!

1744
02:01:15,410 --> 02:01:19,950
So, let's be clear and
erase him from her heart.

1745
02:01:20,080 --> 02:01:22,200
Then the right thing to do
would be me marrying her.

1746
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:25,410
They are more dangerous than criminals…

1747
02:01:25,620 --> 02:01:27,370
You cannot handle them.
Listen to me.

1748
02:01:27,370 --> 02:01:29,580
Ladies fall for the man in form.

1749
02:01:29,870 --> 02:01:31,830
I have come to this town
for an investigation…

1750
02:01:31,830 --> 02:01:33,080
Send Samskriti with me.

1751
02:01:33,120 --> 02:01:35,290
She will notice my skill,
caliber and talent.

1752
02:01:35,370 --> 02:01:39,450
She will fall for me and
voluntarily say she will marry me.

1753
02:01:39,950 --> 02:01:41,250
Epitome of confidence!

1754
02:01:41,370 --> 02:01:44,080
You have the chance to go out.
He's also in Kurnool.

1755
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:45,000
Go get him.

1756
02:01:45,040 --> 02:01:47,830
What if he's not in Kurnool?
-Go to Kashmir directly.

1757
02:01:49,910 --> 02:01:51,950
Observe me keenly, Kishore. Okay?
-Okay.

1758
02:01:52,040 --> 02:01:55,000
Samskruthi, every time you're
impressed during the investigation...

1759
02:01:55,040 --> 02:01:56,910
Hug me tightly and express it, okay?

1760
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:59,040
Feel free! But the hug
is important, okay?

1761
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Along with intelligence, he
is romantic too. - You silly!

1762
02:02:02,040 --> 02:02:03,450
We can give another 25 lakhs.

1763
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:05,040
How long do we have to wait?

1764
02:02:05,660 --> 02:02:07,830
There he is, crime branch Koti.

1765
02:02:09,330 --> 02:02:11,540
I bribed your brother-in-law 25
lakhs for training under him.

1766
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:12,790
Hey, Kishore! Come here.

1767
02:02:13,250 --> 02:02:15,790
No. I didn't use the word 'bribe'.
I said I'm your assistant. -Idiot!

1768
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:19,700
We'll be visiting multiple
locations for the investigation.

1769
02:02:19,750 --> 02:02:22,330
So you didn't change your
scheming mind even in Kurnool.

1770
02:02:22,750 --> 02:02:27,700
After that horrible night in the train…
Why will I conspire again?

1771
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:30,660
Excuse me! Have you seen
my friend's friend Prasad?

1772
02:02:30,700 --> 02:02:31,540
That's me.

1773
02:02:32,120 --> 02:02:35,160
- Why are you facing that side?
- He is shy because there are ladies here.

1774
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:36,330
Yes, I am shy.

1775
02:02:36,700 --> 02:02:39,040
Oh her?! She is my fiance.

1776
02:02:41,120 --> 02:02:42,200
Congratulations!

1777
02:02:42,330 --> 02:02:43,750
But she does not like me.

1778
02:02:44,200 --> 02:02:45,540
You are early.

1779
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:49,660
I want to spend some time with her
and change her opinion about me.

1780
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:52,950
You are here. Why will
she even care for him?

1781
02:02:54,910 --> 02:02:56,040
I am impressed!

1782
02:02:58,450 --> 02:03:00,000
What is she doing?
- Hey, girl! Stop!

1783
02:03:00,120 --> 02:03:03,120
- Samskruthi…! Come here.
- Just pull her back!

1784
02:03:03,410 --> 02:03:04,410
Samskruthi...

1785
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:05,830
What is this, Samskruthi?

1786
02:03:05,950 --> 02:03:09,000
You only asked me to give a
hug everytime I'm impressed.

1787
02:03:09,120 --> 02:03:11,830
Your friend's friend is so cute!

1788
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:14,950
So sweet! So handsome!
I’m impressed.

1789
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,910
Hey, stop! This man is
my friend's friend.

1790
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:19,120
Greetings, sir.

1791
02:03:22,250 --> 02:03:25,660
So this boy died and we have to solve
the mystery, is that it?

1792
02:03:25,660 --> 02:03:26,790
- Yes.
- Okay.

1793
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:30,120
Kishore, clues are very
important in any investigation.

1794
02:03:30,540 --> 02:03:33,080
Do we have the dead boys' phone or laptop?

1795
02:03:33,080 --> 02:03:34,700
We have his phone.

1796
02:03:35,290 --> 02:03:38,040
That’s fantastic! It’s more than enough.
-More than enough for you!

1797
02:03:38,660 --> 02:03:41,250
- Password?
- That is what we called you for.

1798
02:03:41,870 --> 02:03:42,950
Can't you crack the password?

1799
02:03:43,080 --> 02:03:45,120
Can't you crack the password
even after taking 25 lakhs?

1800
02:03:45,200 --> 02:03:47,040
No, Kishore! This is an iphone.

1801
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:49,540
If we try to crack the password, the
entire data will get corrupted.

1802
02:03:50,580 --> 02:03:52,830
We can't go ahead with this case.
We better close it.

1803
02:03:52,950 --> 02:03:54,950
We can crack it with
some common sense.

1804
02:03:54,950 --> 02:03:57,910
Forget about common sense!
I've spent 25 lakhs on intelligence.

1805
02:03:57,950 --> 02:03:59,200
You can't use common sense!

1806
02:03:59,250 --> 02:04:01,700
You can open it with common sense, huh?
Come on! Open it!

1807
02:04:02,330 --> 02:04:04,160
iphone password is not
so easy to crack.

1808
02:04:04,580 --> 02:04:07,410
But with a little common sense, it
is easy to remove its screen guard…

1809
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:12,660
With keen observation, we can find the
fingerprints of the user on random numbers.

1810
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:17,000
1 9 8 2…

1811
02:04:17,370 --> 02:04:18,700
Might be his birth date.

1812
02:04:20,790 --> 02:04:21,790
The phone is open!

1813
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:25,540
I'm impressed!
-Not again!

1814
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:29,250
Hey... girl... wait!!

1815
02:04:31,370 --> 02:04:33,370
Mr. Prasad, get me the
data from this phone.

1816
02:04:34,750 --> 02:04:36,250
- Connect the phone.
- Yes, sir.

1817
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,950
The three of them have a
common WhatsApp group.

1818
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:43,830
They have been conversing
for the last 10 days.

1819
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,950
But those messages are deleted now.

1820
02:04:47,580 --> 02:04:51,120
They must be classmates, considering
they're part of one Whatsapp group.

1821
02:04:51,450 --> 02:04:54,160
She has a software
employee tag on her neck.

1822
02:04:54,160 --> 02:04:57,040
There's a Government designated board
in front of the guy to the right.

1823
02:04:57,080 --> 02:04:59,950
And that's a bank employee on the left.
How can they be colleagues, sir?

1824
02:05:00,450 --> 02:05:03,370
I'm impressed!
-Hey! Why do you keep jumping onto him?

1825
02:05:03,450 --> 02:05:06,200
So my 25 lakhs just went down the drain.

1826
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:08,870
Kishore, once I am on the field
you will see my caliber.

1827
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:11,200
We'll start the investigation
from the girl's house.

1828
02:05:12,620 --> 02:05:14,330
This girl is dead?!

1829
02:05:14,450 --> 02:05:16,790
Soldier has lost to the minister.

1830
02:05:17,660 --> 02:05:20,160
We pampered her a lot because
she is the only daughter.

1831
02:05:20,410 --> 02:05:22,750
She was very active in studies
and everything

1832
02:05:22,750 --> 02:05:26,200
If she had told us about
her love story sooner...

1833
02:05:26,330 --> 02:05:27,910
We would have ensured that
they got married

1834
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:30,250
We don’t know what
transpired between them.

1835
02:05:30,620 --> 02:05:32,790
By the time we knew it, they were dead.

1836
02:05:35,250 --> 02:05:36,700
What is the password of this digital lock?

1837
02:05:36,750 --> 02:05:38,370
Only my daughter knows
the password, sir.

1838
02:05:38,790 --> 02:05:40,750
Kishore, get me a laptop.

1839
02:05:40,790 --> 02:05:44,040
Also get me a fingerprint scanner
so that we can run the digital code.

1840
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:46,120
We can unlock it in an hour.

1841
02:05:49,620 --> 02:05:50,580
Super

1842
02:05:50,580 --> 02:05:52,250
I am impressed

1843
02:05:52,410 --> 02:05:54,040
Samskruthi...

1844
02:05:54,370 --> 02:05:56,450
Are you going to return my
25 lakhs in cash or check?

1845
02:06:03,250 --> 02:06:04,790
- Prasad…
- Yes, boy…

1846
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:07,000
- Let’s go to the government
officer's place. - Sure.

1847
02:06:08,160 --> 02:06:11,370
He is also dead.
Where is this case leading to?

1848
02:06:11,370 --> 02:06:13,540
Once again the soldier has been defeated
to the minister.

1849
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:17,660
He married me even though
he didn't like me.

1850
02:06:18,700 --> 02:06:21,620
Recently, he met a software
employee named Swetha.

1851
02:06:21,910 --> 02:06:24,000
We fought regularly because of her.

1852
02:06:24,200 --> 02:06:27,790
One day, Bank employee Ravi and my husband
were involved in a fight regarding Swetha.

1853
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:30,040
Suddenly they both committed suicide.

1854
02:06:30,330 --> 02:06:31,660
And his death…

1855
02:06:32,660 --> 02:06:34,080
It's very shocking to me.

1856
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:36,120
The soldier lost yet again.

1857
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,910
Kishore, you have to listen to this.
-Shut up!

1858
02:06:40,290 --> 02:06:41,660
Both of them like this girl.

1859
02:06:41,790 --> 02:06:43,410
But she likes him.

1860
02:06:43,500 --> 02:06:44,790
The other guy didn't like it.

1861
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:48,200
So he killed both of them
and committed suicide.

1862
02:06:48,330 --> 02:06:49,830
It's a triangular crime story!

1863
02:06:52,450 --> 02:06:54,290
Minister is on the call.

1864
02:06:54,950 --> 02:06:58,950
You said you'll rewrite the rules.
What have you done so far?

1865
02:06:59,160 --> 02:07:01,830
The story is headed nowhere
no matter how hard you try.

1866
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:04,830
Come on, Minister! Don’t pressurize
me so much. I'm terrified.

1867
02:07:05,370 --> 02:07:07,830
Give us time. We will try.

1868
02:07:07,870 --> 02:07:09,450
Try what?

1869
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:12,080
As far as I know, you cannot
go ahead with this case.

1870
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:14,790
We cannot go ahead with this case
unless we send this guy out.

1871
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:17,500
Her parents only told us it was a
case of love affair and suicide.

1872
02:07:17,540 --> 02:07:20,120
Hey, they are not her parents.
She is an orphan!

1873
02:07:20,200 --> 02:07:22,200
- Damn!
- I am impressed!

1874
02:07:22,250 --> 02:07:24,410
You wait.
How do you know that?

1875
02:07:24,830 --> 02:07:26,500
Hey… you did investigate something right?
- Yeah

1876
02:07:26,540 --> 02:07:27,750
What did you observe
in the girl's house?

1877
02:07:28,910 --> 02:07:32,620
There was a tea cup on the table
and a half eaten idly in a plate.

1878
02:07:32,870 --> 02:07:35,200
And the two flies around the plate?
- Not two. There were four flies.

1879
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:37,410
He must've been a hotel server. Bloody!

1880
02:07:37,540 --> 02:07:40,040
There is a painting on the
wall in the girl's house.

1881
02:07:40,120 --> 02:07:42,790
The quotation on that painting
reflects an orphan's life.

1882
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:46,410
There was an application form in
her room signed by her guardian.

1883
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:49,950
I also found receipts of her
donations to orphanages every month.

1884
02:07:50,330 --> 02:07:52,580
The Minister has created
her fake parents.

1885
02:07:52,620 --> 02:07:54,500
- Damn!
- I am impressed!

1886
02:07:54,540 --> 02:07:57,370
Hey, girl! Hold on.
Please wait. Hold on.

1887
02:07:57,540 --> 02:08:00,540
- Please take her away.
- Hey, Samskruthi... Come with me.

1888
02:08:00,540 --> 02:08:02,200
Come and stand here.

1889
02:08:02,700 --> 02:08:05,580
Kishore, then the government officer’s
wife is also fake.

1890
02:08:05,620 --> 02:08:06,750
She is real.

1891
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:09,000
What did you observe in that house?

1892
02:08:10,200 --> 02:08:13,410
A bucket of water and a
cloth to clean the tiles.

1893
02:08:13,450 --> 02:08:16,120
- What about the broom stick?
- Right! 'Gopuram' broom stick.

1894
02:08:16,250 --> 02:08:17,660
'Gopuram' broom stick, huh?

1895
02:08:17,870 --> 02:08:20,910
He must be working in the Municipality.
You've gotten him into this.

1896
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:22,450
Did you see the family photos
in their house?

1897
02:08:22,580 --> 02:08:24,250
They have been to 8 countries
in the last 4 years.

1898
02:08:24,450 --> 02:08:25,700
Most happiest couple…

1899
02:08:25,790 --> 02:08:27,290
Why will he cheat on his wife?

1900
02:08:27,790 --> 02:08:30,000
The Minister threatened
her to lie about it.

1901
02:08:31,290 --> 02:08:32,450
Oh... How did I miss that?

1902
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:34,200
When did you ever guess anything right?

1903
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:38,700
Minister made sure that whoever investigates
this case would go according to his plan.

1904
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:42,330
We know this is all a lie.
But how do we prove it?

1905
02:08:43,290 --> 02:08:45,040
We can prove it if we
use our common sense.

1906
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:48,200
Right! Like your common sense is going to
bring her husband back and reveal the truth.

1907
02:08:48,250 --> 02:08:50,290
One of the victims isn't dead.

1908
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,330
I am impressed!

1909
02:08:52,370 --> 02:08:55,790
I'll give you extra 10 lakhs on the
25, bro. Let me be your assistant.

1910
02:08:55,830 --> 02:08:57,540
Please, bro. Please!
-How can one of them be alive?

1911
02:08:58,040 --> 02:08:59,660
Play those photos once.

1912
02:09:00,870 --> 02:09:02,290
Mr. Prasad, this is original.

1913
02:09:02,750 --> 02:09:04,910
This is the fake body
replaced with the original.

1914
02:09:06,330 --> 02:09:10,620
He has five fingers but
the fake body has six fingers.

1915
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:16,620
He has created a fake dead
body instead of killing him.

1916
02:09:16,950 --> 02:09:20,160
Damn it! I lost.
-Hey, Minister. You got hasty.

1917
02:09:20,200 --> 02:09:22,500
This Minister is dead in
the hands of the soldier.

1918
02:09:22,830 --> 02:09:23,750
It's true.

1919
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:28,700
Minister, you haven't
erased your traces well.

1920
02:09:29,290 --> 02:09:31,700
One of the three people
you've killed is still alive.

1921
02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:35,700
You used a fake body in the third person’s
place and covered it up well enough.

1922
02:09:35,790 --> 02:09:39,620
But the fake body has six fingers.
How did you miss that logic, Minister ?

1923
02:09:39,830 --> 02:09:41,200
So you haven't been seamless.

1924
02:09:42,250 --> 02:09:46,120
When you hid a man instead of killing him,
it is obvious that he knows everything.

1925
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:49,040
I will find him in an hour.

1926
02:09:49,160 --> 02:09:51,290
Don't take the trouble.
I will only tell you.

1927
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:53,290
He is in Nallamalla forest.

1928
02:09:53,450 --> 02:09:55,450
Atmakur is 90 minutes
away from Kurnool.

1929
02:09:55,620 --> 02:09:58,370
It’ll take another hour if
you take the Ghat Road.

1930
02:09:59,290 --> 02:10:02,830
Go and get him if you're
really as gutsy as you claim.

1931
02:10:04,450 --> 02:10:05,830
Why did you give it away, sir?

1932
02:10:06,700 --> 02:10:09,290
Did anyone ever return from
the Nallamalla forest?

1933
02:10:12,040 --> 02:10:17,830
Alluri Sitarama Raju’s biggest strength
lies in the forest.

1934
02:10:32,540 --> 02:10:33,700
He can't enter the town at any cost.
-Minister!

1935
02:10:40,580 --> 02:10:43,250
What brings you here, Professor?

1936
02:10:43,290 --> 02:10:46,330
I came to see you smile
for one last time.

1937
02:10:46,500 --> 02:10:48,870
Do you think he will come back
from the forest?

1938
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:51,080
There are no humans there.
Only cruel animals.

1939
02:10:51,660 --> 02:10:54,830
It is not a municipal park.
It's the Nallamalla forest.

1940
02:10:55,370 --> 02:10:56,450
Forest, huh?

1941
02:10:56,830 --> 02:10:58,870
The man who went there is not a tourist

1942
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:01,120
He is a hunter.

1943
02:11:04,830 --> 02:11:06,290
A Hunter!

1944
02:11:24,330 --> 02:11:27,790
Boy, they look so young.

1945
02:11:28,200 --> 02:11:30,410
That man looks old enough
to be eligible for pension.

1946
02:11:30,660 --> 02:11:32,790
- Why did Minister give such a build up?
- I know, right?

1947
02:11:33,250 --> 02:11:36,370
We cannot beat the youth or
swear at the elderly. What to do?

1948
02:11:36,370 --> 02:11:38,700
You go in a cool manner and get him…

1949
02:11:39,120 --> 02:11:41,790
I’ll deal with these kids.

1950
02:11:42,120 --> 02:11:43,330
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

1951
02:12:25,950 --> 02:12:31,620
Ramana... we have to lift the load
before check post gets closed.

1952
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:40,830
Mr. Prasad...

1953
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:44,200
- Son.
- You said you will take care of the kids.

1954
02:12:44,950 --> 02:12:46,160
You said he is an old man.

1955
02:12:46,450 --> 02:12:49,370
They thrashed me badly.
You said you'd take care of it.

1956
02:12:49,790 --> 02:12:53,410
I am taking care of it.
You try harder in this round.

1957
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:27,700
Ramana... we have to lift the load
before check post gets closed.

1958
02:13:33,750 --> 02:13:35,000
You said he's from the military.

1959
02:13:35,500 --> 02:13:37,160
Those kids have been thrashing him.

1960
02:13:37,200 --> 02:13:39,500
I'll kill him in 5 minutes
and call you back.

1961
02:13:41,620 --> 02:13:43,830
I’ll get a call in 3 minutes.

1962
02:14:33,410 --> 02:14:34,750
Ramana...

1963
02:14:35,950 --> 02:14:37,500
Lift the load…

1964
02:14:37,700 --> 02:14:39,330
Check post will be closed.

1965
02:15:07,830 --> 02:15:09,830
What are you doing in the
forest instead of studying?

1966
02:15:09,830 --> 02:15:11,660
What were you doing, huh?

1967
02:15:13,160 --> 02:15:14,200
Ramana...

1968
02:15:14,950 --> 02:15:16,250
Lift the load

1969
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:18,620
Check post will be closed.

1970
02:15:18,910 --> 02:15:20,910
Looks like he is deeply hurt.

1971
02:15:23,870 --> 02:15:27,620
Ramana, we need to lift the load.

1972
02:15:30,160 --> 02:15:31,700
He died before he could lift the load.

1973
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:38,040
We're on our way with the witness.
We will reach Kurnool in an hour.

1974
02:15:38,200 --> 02:15:39,410
Your game is over.

1975
02:15:51,620 --> 02:15:53,120
My name is Ramakrishna, sir.

1976
02:15:53,500 --> 02:15:56,950
I am working as Mandal Parishad
development officer in Kurnool.

1977
02:15:57,250 --> 02:16:01,450
As a government officer I don’t
just handle applications or papers …

1978
02:16:01,830 --> 02:16:03,200
But lives of some people.

1979
02:16:03,330 --> 02:16:06,290
We are receiving pension
only for 6 months in an year.

1980
02:16:06,330 --> 02:16:09,830
My handicapped son is not getting
his pension regularly.

1981
02:16:09,830 --> 02:16:12,750
The funds that were supposed to reach
the people from the Government...

1982
02:16:12,830 --> 02:16:15,910
I wondered how they went
missing for a few months.

1983
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,790
I asked my friend Ravi who is working
in the bank to enquire about it.

1984
02:16:24,040 --> 02:16:25,580
There we found a new truth.

1985
02:16:25,620 --> 02:16:26,830
Sir, take a look at this.

1986
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:29,540
Hundreds of fake accounts were created
in the name of people with no identity.

1987
02:16:29,620 --> 02:16:31,250
We visited their homes
to find no one there.

1988
02:16:31,290 --> 02:16:32,410
But the money is being
deposited into their accounts.

1989
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:33,500
Check out this statement, sir.

1990
02:16:33,540 --> 02:16:37,830
We found out these fake accounts were
created in Minister Nagendra's company.

1991
02:16:38,040 --> 02:16:40,450
So we approached a software employee
who is working there.

1992
02:16:40,910 --> 02:16:44,700
The data that she has brought revealed
shocking truths about the minister.

1993
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:48,410
Previously, money is distributed by hand
in public welfare schemes.

1994
02:16:48,580 --> 02:16:53,450
But ever since they made it online, people
have found several ways to commit fraud.

1995
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:55,540
This fake accounts creation
is a part of that.

1996
02:16:57,290 --> 02:17:00,120
Thousands of fake accounts have
been created in the past four years.

1997
02:17:00,370 --> 02:17:04,250
They bribe the officers and bank managers
without the Government's knowledge.

1998
02:17:04,410 --> 02:17:07,290
He has looted funds from the public
welfare schemes worth 5000 crores.

1999
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:10,290
These evidences are enough.

2000
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:12,700
We're going to meet the
Chief minister tomorrow.

2001
02:17:12,950 --> 02:17:15,120
He found out that we were
meeting the Chief Minister.

2002
02:17:15,250 --> 02:17:17,500
So Minister attacked us with his goons.

2003
02:17:17,790 --> 02:17:20,250
Those two lost their
lives in that process.

2004
02:17:29,910 --> 02:17:33,830
They held me captive in the
Nallamala forest for the evidence.

2005
02:17:35,750 --> 02:17:37,950
What we found out was
nothing extraordinary, sir.

2006
02:17:38,910 --> 02:17:45,910
People got used to these kind of scams
done by our leaders throughout the country.

2007
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:49,950
Minister didn't just loot 5000 crores.

2008
02:17:52,250 --> 02:17:53,910
He looted people's hopes and tears.

2009
02:17:56,500 --> 02:18:01,540
This hard disk has got all the
evidences regarding minister’s scams.

2010
02:18:04,080 --> 02:18:06,330
Your wife and children are
waiting for you at home.

2011
02:18:06,500 --> 02:18:08,410
Go and spend some
quality time with them.

2012
02:18:12,540 --> 02:18:16,790
- We’ll kick that Military guy out of Kurnool.
- Cabinet will deal with him.

2013
02:18:16,790 --> 02:18:18,870
Why didn't you tell us
when so much was going on?

2014
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:21,000
After all a soldier dares to oppose us?

2015
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,250
Let him! We will show him the
power of a political leader.

2016
02:18:40,450 --> 02:18:41,660
Hey, Nagendra…

2017
02:18:41,750 --> 02:18:43,290
Is he the soldier you told us about?

2018
02:18:43,540 --> 02:18:47,250
A soldier is supposed to visit for holidays
and go back to guarding the borders.

2019
02:18:47,450 --> 02:18:50,790
Why do you want to mess
with the politicians?

2020
02:18:52,120 --> 02:18:54,910
Hey, you listened to me and
showed up without any fuss.

2021
02:18:55,000 --> 02:18:58,410
Now put down the evidence file,
put your head down and walk away.

2022
02:18:58,830 --> 02:19:00,120
Give me that file.

2023
02:19:04,790 --> 02:19:06,160
Let's go, Prasad.

2024
02:19:08,580 --> 02:19:11,500
Is this the guy whom you feared to?

2025
02:19:17,660 --> 02:19:21,410
Whoa! The soldier is locking the door.
We're trembling.

2026
02:19:21,580 --> 02:19:24,870
This is not your border
to show authority.

2027
02:19:25,410 --> 02:19:27,620
We control the system,
police and law and order.

2028
02:19:27,700 --> 02:19:29,790
We can put false cases on
you and get you locked up.

2029
02:19:29,830 --> 02:19:32,750
What are you still looking at?
Suspend that soldier.

2030
02:19:32,750 --> 02:19:35,330
You fool! Don't you know the difference
between a policeman and military man?

2031
02:19:35,330 --> 02:19:38,790
Hey, Army! You'll end up in the
Himalayas if I kick you here.

2032
02:19:38,910 --> 02:19:40,120
You're messing with political leaders.

2033
02:19:40,290 --> 02:19:43,580
We'll call you the next time
there's a natural disaster.

2034
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:46,120
He's making some doll
that kids play with.

2035
02:19:51,870 --> 02:19:54,410
Stop making that doll when
we're talking to you!

2036
02:19:54,410 --> 02:19:55,700
Say something!

2037
02:19:56,370 --> 02:19:57,200
All right.

2038
02:19:57,370 --> 02:20:00,160
Since you asked, I will
tell you a small story.

2039
02:20:00,500 --> 02:20:03,160
This is an incident I
witnessed when I was young.

2040
02:20:03,450 --> 02:20:06,250
There is a place called
Burripalem near Tenali.

2041
02:20:06,910 --> 02:20:08,830
An old man planted rice crop there.

2042
02:20:09,120 --> 02:20:10,620
It grew well.

2043
02:20:11,040 --> 02:20:14,750
In the night, a rat would come
and start eating away the crop.

2044
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:17,370
Old man got angry.

2045
02:20:17,750 --> 02:20:20,620
'Hey, rat! Why are you
destroying my crop?'

2046
02:20:20,910 --> 02:20:23,330
'Let me set fire to your
side and kill you.'

2047
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:26,250
The rat's ego got hurt.

2048
02:20:26,580 --> 02:20:29,160
That rat summoned another
100 rats at night.

2049
02:20:29,450 --> 02:20:31,200
'The old man will set our side on fire.'

2050
02:20:31,290 --> 02:20:35,200
'We’ll hide on the other
side and eat all the crop.'

2051
02:20:36,450 --> 02:20:40,950
The old man is smart enough to
set fire on the rat's side.

2052
02:20:41,330 --> 02:20:45,330
All those rats choked to death.

2053
02:20:45,410 --> 02:20:48,250
Why did you tell us this rat story now?

2054
02:20:48,290 --> 02:20:51,290
Both our stories have so
many similarities, sir.

2055
02:20:51,500 --> 02:20:54,160
This is the rat the old man
wanted to smoke up.

2056
02:20:56,540 --> 02:20:59,080
You people are those 100 rats
that showed up for support.

2057
02:21:00,750 --> 02:21:04,290
Old man set the fire because he is a
farmer. But I am from Military, right?

2058
02:21:06,620 --> 02:21:08,540
That is why I have planted a bomb.

2059
02:21:08,700 --> 02:21:09,950
Bomb?!

2060
02:21:12,620 --> 02:21:16,040
This is not a bullet that you can evade.

2061
02:21:16,330 --> 02:21:19,700
It's a bomb, sir.
You'll explode into pieces.

2062
02:21:21,660 --> 02:21:24,000
Hey! I'll pull the wire if anybody moves.

2063
02:21:27,910 --> 02:21:29,910
I've set the timer for 5 minutes.

2064
02:21:30,200 --> 02:21:31,750
I'll speak for 4 minutes.

2065
02:21:32,040 --> 02:21:33,870
I'll diffuse it in a minute and leave.

2066
02:21:33,870 --> 02:21:35,660
Speak quickly. Make it fast.

2067
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:39,450
My rat stole 5000 crores.

2068
02:21:39,910 --> 02:21:41,160
I couldn't sleep all night.

2069
02:21:41,370 --> 02:21:45,330
I typed 'Indian Political
Scams' on Google.

2070
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:51,910
Politicians in power has looted approximately
upto 20 lakh crores in the last 20 years,

2071
02:21:54,450 --> 02:21:57,660
What? Are you shocked that
you had looted so much?

2072
02:21:57,830 --> 02:22:00,660
You have forgotten about it.
So did the people.

2073
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:03,830
Country has forgotten too.
But Google did not forget.

2074
02:22:03,950 --> 02:22:05,580
If you just type it, you can see it all.

2075
02:22:06,910 --> 02:22:10,450
If at least .001 percent
of that scammed money...

2076
02:22:10,540 --> 02:22:14,290
Was used to solve the basic ground
level problems of our country...

2077
02:22:14,290 --> 02:22:15,410
For example...

2078
02:22:15,660 --> 02:22:19,450
If a child falls into an open tube well in
China, they are rescuing him in an hour.

2079
02:22:19,790 --> 02:22:24,950
In India, we call for a proclaimer
that digs and digs for three days.

2080
02:22:25,160 --> 02:22:27,160
But there' still no guarantee
that the child will be saved.

2081
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:28,540
Why don't we get updated?

2082
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:33,870
Japan Government introduced a railway
line for 3 years to help a girl study.

2083
02:22:34,290 --> 02:22:36,000
For a girl alone!

2084
02:22:36,160 --> 02:22:38,700
Let's not even mention the
Government schools in our country.

2085
02:22:38,870 --> 02:22:42,080
We lack basic facilities
like toilets for girls.

2086
02:22:42,410 --> 02:22:43,870
Why don't we upgrade?

2087
02:22:44,750 --> 02:22:48,370
Drinking water, good
roads, good hospitals...

2088
02:22:48,370 --> 02:22:51,410
And also the little kids
dying from ailments...

2089
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:56,080
So much can be done with
the looted money, right?

2090
02:22:57,580 --> 02:23:03,330
Government links every citizen's AADHAR card ,
PAN CARD to his bank account in our country.

2091
02:23:03,450 --> 02:23:06,580
It tracks his everyday finances...

2092
02:23:06,580 --> 02:23:09,540
His income and expenditure.

2093
02:23:09,700 --> 02:23:13,160
You are monitoring every penny of these
citizens by sitting in an AC room, right?

2094
02:23:13,330 --> 02:23:15,660
Nothing wrong in it.
Financial transparency!

2095
02:23:15,700 --> 02:23:17,870
Rob from the rich and
distribute to the poor.

2096
02:23:17,910 --> 02:23:19,080
That’s excellent!

2097
02:23:19,330 --> 02:23:24,250
Similarly, we pay billions of rupees
in the form of taxes to you.

2098
02:23:24,290 --> 02:23:27,950
You pretend like everyone is
benefitting through your schemes.

2099
02:23:28,120 --> 02:23:30,250
You project the budget like a spectacle.

2100
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:34,080
Don't we have the right to know about those
transactions and the loopholes that follow?

2101
02:23:35,500 --> 02:23:39,660
Why don't we get to have a look at
Government's AADHAR and PAN card?

2102
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:43,200
Open an account for every constituency.

2103
02:23:43,450 --> 02:23:44,830
Give us the PAN card details.

2104
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:49,790
We'll also monitor every transaction of the Government
while relaxing at home with a cup of coffee.

2105
02:23:51,700 --> 02:23:52,660
But you won't do that.

2106
02:23:52,910 --> 02:23:55,790
You can monitor us every second.

2107
02:23:56,080 --> 02:23:58,250
But we aren’t supposed to.
Because you want to loot money.

2108
02:23:59,410 --> 02:24:01,790
No matter how many mistakes you make...

2109
02:24:02,450 --> 02:24:04,500
No matter how insensitive
your acts are...

2110
02:24:04,910 --> 02:24:10,330
We guard you and your family
at the border responsibly.

2111
02:24:10,580 --> 02:24:13,500
You are the people that I am protecting.

2112
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:15,450
We're sacrificing our lives
for you at the border.

2113
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:18,120
But you act so foolish.
Aren't you supposed to be responsible?

2114
02:24:19,750 --> 02:24:21,250
That's my rat.

2115
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:25,000
I promised that I’ll make him responsible.

2116
02:24:25,370 --> 02:24:27,950
If any other rat tries to rescue him...

2117
02:24:28,540 --> 02:24:31,040
I'll set fire to its side.

2118
02:25:09,290 --> 02:25:11,830
What if he had held this meeting
in the presence of Media?

2119
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,700
What would have happened to us?

2120
02:25:15,540 --> 02:25:16,790
Let's not back this rat anymore.

2121
02:25:20,680 --> 02:25:23,140
You were sent to be my son-in-law.

2122
02:25:23,720 --> 02:25:25,350
But you turned out to be a broker.

2123
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:29,100
What should I do now?
-You can do a lot.

2124
02:25:29,220 --> 02:25:30,680
You can decorate the house.

2125
02:25:31,010 --> 02:25:32,220
You can serve food at the wedding.

2126
02:25:32,300 --> 02:25:34,300
You can escort the
bride to the trellis.

2127
02:25:34,350 --> 02:25:36,430
Or you can pay the
interest for my bribe.

2128
02:25:36,470 --> 02:25:38,180
Look down.
-Do we have an option?

2129
02:25:38,220 --> 02:25:41,390
Let's beg that Army man
and host the wedding.

2130
02:25:42,930 --> 02:25:43,720
Where are they?

2131
02:25:44,680 --> 02:25:47,260
Dad, the wedding has to be fantastic.

2132
02:25:47,260 --> 02:25:48,640
Wow!!!

2133
02:25:48,720 --> 02:25:50,180
Such a wife and kids...

2134
02:25:50,220 --> 02:25:52,140
Never before! Ever after!

2135
02:25:57,640 --> 02:25:59,640
"He was more of a pants person"

2136
02:26:00,800 --> 02:26:02,600
"He's put on a dhoti now"

2137
02:26:02,640 --> 02:26:03,550
"Wow!"

2138
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:06,180
"He was more of a shirt person"

2139
02:26:06,680 --> 02:26:08,680
"He's put on a tight t-shirt now"

2140
02:26:10,100 --> 02:26:13,010
"Jasmines on the hand
and glares to the eyes"

2141
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:15,800
"He's dressed up top to bottom"

2142
02:26:19,180 --> 02:26:21,180
"For the first time"

2143
02:26:21,640 --> 02:26:23,640
"He's into mass crime"

2144
02:26:28,350 --> 02:26:29,470
"Tell him, man"

2145
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:30,300
"Tell him what?"

2146
02:26:30,430 --> 02:26:31,970
"To play the drums"

2147
02:26:32,050 --> 02:26:32,890
"Hmm. Come on"

2148
02:26:42,470 --> 02:26:44,470
"Moonwalk... Moonwalk..."

2149
02:26:44,850 --> 02:26:46,850
"Hey, girl... You've got the moonwalk"

2150
02:26:47,220 --> 02:26:49,220
"Earthquake... Earthquake..."

2151
02:26:49,550 --> 02:26:51,550
"Your touch feels like an earthquake"

2152
02:26:51,760 --> 02:26:54,050
"Your lips are yummy like a cup cake"

2153
02:26:54,260 --> 02:26:56,260
"Your words are sweet like milkshake"

2154
02:26:56,550 --> 02:26:58,550
"Your beauty is stocked up"

2155
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:03,180
"You're like a hot delicacy"

2156
02:27:03,640 --> 02:27:05,640
"You're smooth like a lotus"

2157
02:27:05,970 --> 02:27:07,970
"You make my heart skip a beat"

2158
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:13,050
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..".

2159
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:15,220
"Your mass look gives me a mind block"

2160
02:27:15,430 --> 02:27:17,800
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2161
02:27:17,890 --> 02:27:19,890
"Your moves give me a mind block"

2162
02:27:20,140 --> 02:27:22,510
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2163
02:27:22,600 --> 02:27:24,600
"Your mass look gives me a mind block"

2164
02:27:24,850 --> 02:27:27,220
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2165
02:27:27,300 --> 02:27:29,300
"Your moves give me a mind block"

2166
02:27:29,550 --> 02:27:31,390
"Tell him, man
-Tell him what?"

2167
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,050
"To play music"

2168
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:34,550
"Come on, play music"

2169
02:27:53,430 --> 02:27:54,300
"Hold on, man"

2170
02:27:58,640 --> 02:28:01,180
"My heart drops to the floor
when you drape a saree"

2171
02:28:01,300 --> 02:28:03,600
"Your naughty glances set me on fire"

2172
02:28:03,640 --> 02:28:07,850
"I feel shy when you talk like that"

2173
02:28:08,100 --> 02:28:10,600
"The kohl on your eyes turns
the world drunk"

2174
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:12,890
"The vermillion on your forehead
makes the sun shine"

2175
02:28:13,050 --> 02:28:17,430
"I feel ticked when you look
at me like that"

2176
02:28:17,640 --> 02:28:19,970
"Your eyes are intoxicating"

2177
02:28:20,010 --> 02:28:22,260
"Your curves are scintillating"

2178
02:28:22,350 --> 02:28:24,720
"Your fragrance staggers the world"

2179
02:28:27,180 --> 02:28:29,510
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2180
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:31,680
"Your mass look gives me a mind block"

2181
02:28:31,890 --> 02:28:34,220
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2182
02:28:34,300 --> 02:28:36,300
"Your moves give me a mind block"

2183
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:38,890
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2184
02:28:38,970 --> 02:28:41,220
"Your mass look gives me a mind block"

2185
02:28:41,300 --> 02:28:43,550
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2186
02:28:43,640 --> 02:28:45,640
"Your moves give me a mind block"

2187
02:28:46,010 --> 02:28:47,890
"Tell him, man
- Tell him what?"

2188
02:28:48,050 --> 02:28:49,550
"To play the drums"

2189
02:28:49,640 --> 02:28:50,930
"Come on, play!"

2190
02:29:13,800 --> 02:29:15,180
"Hey, look at me"

2191
02:29:15,390 --> 02:29:17,760
"What?
- Ask him to speed up."

2192
02:29:18,180 --> 02:29:19,300
"Do as she says, man."

2193
02:29:23,680 --> 02:29:25,850
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2194
02:29:26,010 --> 02:29:28,010
"Your mass look gives me a mind block"

2195
02:29:28,390 --> 02:29:30,550
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2196
02:29:30,720 --> 02:29:32,720
"Your moves give me a mind block"

2197
02:29:33,050 --> 02:29:35,220
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2198
02:29:35,390 --> 02:29:37,390
"Your mass look gives me a mind block"

2199
02:29:37,800 --> 02:29:39,970
"Mind block... Mind block... Mind block..."

2200
02:29:40,140 --> 02:29:42,430
"Your moves give me a mind block"

2201
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:56,140
Chief Minister is planning to
suspend Nagendra from the party.

2202
02:29:56,220 --> 02:29:59,260
This party is like a mother. It will
punish anyone who commits a mistake.

2203
02:29:59,350 --> 02:30:01,140
We will sacrifice lives for the party.

2204
02:30:01,260 --> 02:30:03,890
You've been fired from the
party along with Nagendra.

2205
02:30:03,970 --> 02:30:05,550
Bloody hell! I'll find another
party if not this one.

2206
02:30:05,640 --> 02:30:07,350
I swear I'll change the
party in 30 minutes.

2207
02:30:07,430 --> 02:30:09,140
You are still in.
Nagendra has been fired.

2208
02:30:09,180 --> 02:30:12,890
Party is like a mother. It will
punish anyone who commits a mistake.

2209
02:30:12,930 --> 02:30:14,970
I will sacrifice my life
for the party and...

2210
02:30:15,010 --> 02:30:17,550
Sir, which side are we on now?
-That side!

2211
02:30:48,890 --> 02:30:49,600
Tell me, sir…

2212
02:30:49,640 --> 02:30:51,100
Ajay, we lost him.

2213
02:30:59,890 --> 02:31:01,930
I don't know how are you going to
convey this news to her.

2214
02:31:02,470 --> 02:31:05,890
But you'll have to handle this.
Just take care.

2215
02:31:13,760 --> 02:31:15,930
How will you convey this to her?

2216
02:31:16,100 --> 02:31:17,760
Even I'm not sure, Mr. Prasad.

2217
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:50,930
The wedding was great.

2218
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:54,260
After my husband's demise...

2219
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:57,100
I raised 3 kids all by myself.

2220
02:31:59,140 --> 02:32:03,930
When I would pin flags on their
pockets on August 15th...

2221
02:32:04,600 --> 02:32:06,390
I would feel really proud.

2222
02:32:11,800 --> 02:32:18,260
Now when they salute the same flag,
I feel the same pride as before.

2223
02:32:20,970 --> 02:32:25,930
Even if my son comes home
wrapped in the same flag...

2224
02:32:27,850 --> 02:32:29,760
I will feel the same sense of pride.

2225
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:37,890
Will my son come home or not?

2226
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:04,930
Did I lose another son?

2227
02:33:09,640 --> 02:33:11,510
Should I mourn him or…

2228
02:33:13,600 --> 02:33:16,300
But many of them are fighting
at the border just like my son.

2229
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:21,050
I could just envision
my son in all of you.

2230
02:33:25,430 --> 02:33:26,890
He's my youngest son.

2231
02:33:27,930 --> 02:33:29,050
I love him more.

2232
02:33:31,390 --> 02:33:33,100
I raised him well.

2233
02:33:37,720 --> 02:33:38,970
I will always carry that pain around.

2234
02:33:40,550 --> 02:33:44,760
But I can't demean his
sacrifice with my tears.

2235
02:33:46,390 --> 02:33:47,430
I just can't!

2236
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:53,350
Everyone here wants to live a long life.

2237
02:33:54,350 --> 02:33:57,100
Even when the issue is petty,
they're desperate to stay alive.

2238
02:33:57,930 --> 02:33:59,850
They get anxious and visit
the doctor to stay alive.

2239
02:34:00,300 --> 02:34:01,850
They want to pray to God to stay alive.

2240
02:34:02,300 --> 02:34:04,180
They want to spend
crores to stay alive.

2241
02:34:04,850 --> 02:34:07,140
But for all these people
you're in no way related to...

2242
02:34:08,100 --> 02:34:10,350
How do you people sacrifice
your lives so easily?

2243
02:34:14,390 --> 02:34:15,600
In spite of that...

2244
02:34:16,180 --> 02:34:18,470
I gave two of my sons up for the country.

2245
02:34:20,260 --> 02:34:21,600
Why should I mourn?

2246
02:34:23,260 --> 02:34:24,510
Why should I mourn?

2247
02:34:35,010 --> 02:34:38,050
Be it any loss or pain, only women
have it in them to bear it.

2248
02:34:38,970 --> 02:34:42,600
Maybe that is why a country is
always compared to mother.

2249
02:34:57,640 --> 02:35:02,300
"Even in the face of
blazing showers of fire"

2250
02:35:02,680 --> 02:35:07,390
"A soldier paces ahead
in the name of his country"

2251
02:35:07,760 --> 02:35:12,390
"In spite of wrenching cyclones of snow"

2252
02:35:12,760 --> 02:35:17,510
"A soldier marches ahead,
refusing to step back"

2253
02:35:17,850 --> 02:35:22,470
"Bullets might rain hell down on him"

2254
02:35:22,600 --> 02:35:27,510
"A soldier fights death with all his might"

2255
02:35:27,640 --> 02:35:30,100
"Despite all the artillery charging at him"

2256
02:35:30,220 --> 02:35:32,800
"A soldier puts his life at stakes"

2257
02:35:33,010 --> 02:35:36,680
"He’s one and only
He's a soldier!!!"

2258
02:35:37,970 --> 02:35:41,550
"No one can match you!"

2259
02:35:42,890 --> 02:35:46,180
"We bow to your resilience"

2260
02:35:47,800 --> 02:35:51,600
"No one can match you!"

2261
02:35:52,720 --> 02:35:57,100
"You're an epitome of patriotism"

2262
02:36:28,010 --> 02:36:32,010
"No one can match you!"

2263
02:36:39,350 --> 02:36:40,510
Son...

2264
02:36:41,470 --> 02:36:43,510
If I hadn't come with you...

2265
02:36:44,510 --> 02:36:47,550
I would've missed some
great memories in my life.

2266
02:36:49,930 --> 02:36:51,390
Thanks a lot, son.

2267
02:36:53,180 --> 02:36:55,100
We have one last thing to do.

2268
02:36:57,260 --> 02:36:59,180
We should capture that rat in a cage.

2269
02:36:59,220 --> 02:37:01,970
Major Ajay is going to
submit witness in the court.

2270
02:37:02,140 --> 02:37:04,760
The judgement on Ex- Minister
Nagendra is going to be out today.

2271
02:37:04,800 --> 02:37:07,720
This is going to leave a
dent on my son's vase.

2272
02:37:18,680 --> 02:37:23,180
Is it snowing in Kurnool,
that you are shivering so much?

2273
02:37:24,390 --> 02:37:28,100
You already knew I was going to
end up in this position, right?

2274
02:37:28,510 --> 02:37:31,680
I only got to see Sitarama raju once.

2275
02:37:32,430 --> 02:37:33,930
You got lucky.

2276
02:37:34,680 --> 02:37:36,600
You saw him for four to five times.

2277
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:42,470
'Aren't you supposed to be responsible?'

2278
02:37:43,180 --> 02:37:46,180
Sir, our men have started from
Kadapa, Produtur, and Anantpur.

2279
02:37:46,260 --> 02:37:47,680
They will kill him before
he reaches the court.

2280
02:37:47,720 --> 02:37:51,970
Why bother? He beat us at the fort.
He beat us at our house.

2281
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:53,220
He beat us in the forest.

2282
02:37:53,510 --> 02:37:56,180
You want them beaten up too?
I've had enough.

2283
02:37:56,970 --> 02:38:00,350
No matter which district it is...
He's going to leave dents on many vases.

2284
02:38:00,430 --> 02:38:01,510
What shall we do now ,sir?

2285
02:38:01,680 --> 02:38:04,640
Let's go and surrender in court.

2286
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:05,640
How come, sir?

2287
02:38:06,390 --> 02:38:08,010
In politics...

2288
02:38:08,430 --> 02:38:13,850
Sympathy is much powerful than
caste, religion, region or money.

2289
02:38:13,850 --> 02:38:16,510
We won't stay calm if
Nagendra brother is arrested.

2290
02:38:16,510 --> 02:38:18,050
We're ready to die for him.

2291
02:38:18,180 --> 02:38:19,550
Hail Nagendra!

2292
02:38:19,680 --> 02:38:21,470
He should appear at court.

2293
02:38:21,930 --> 02:38:23,550
I should be sentenced.

2294
02:38:23,970 --> 02:38:25,430
I should go to jail.

2295
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:27,760
I should gain a lot of
sympathy when I'm released.

2296
02:38:28,010 --> 02:38:30,100
I should become Minister again.

2297
02:38:30,720 --> 02:38:32,850
Brother, he is not coming to the court.

2298
02:38:32,970 --> 02:38:36,180
He is off to the railway
station to leave to Kashmir.

2299
02:38:36,300 --> 02:38:37,640
What!?

2300
02:38:38,010 --> 02:38:40,180
If he's headed to Kashmir instead
of coming to the court...

2301
02:38:40,600 --> 02:38:42,100
He has some plan up his sleeve.

2302
02:38:42,180 --> 02:38:43,180
Start the car!

2303
02:38:45,930 --> 02:38:47,300
'Ruin others and you will be ruined.'

2304
02:38:47,350 --> 02:38:48,760
'Pen is mightier than the sword.'

2305
02:38:48,850 --> 02:38:50,100
'Truth always triumphs.'

2306
02:38:50,140 --> 02:38:51,550
'If you think you're
the most powerful...'

2307
02:38:51,720 --> 02:38:53,180
'There's always someone
more powerful than you.'

2308
02:38:53,180 --> 02:38:55,220
These are the lessons that I had
taught you in your childhood

2309
02:38:55,390 --> 02:38:57,050
They are the absolute truths.

2310
02:38:58,050 --> 02:38:59,390
Let's go to the railway station.

2311
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:01,850
Let's go.

2312
02:39:12,500 --> 02:39:14,750
- Let's go... Hurry up.
- Let's go.

2313
02:39:15,250 --> 02:39:16,870
- One by one, one by one
- Ma’am…

2314
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,290
- I will go first. I have some work.
- I also have some work.

2315
02:39:19,330 --> 02:39:21,500
- I have urgent work
- I also have urgent work.

2316
02:39:22,580 --> 02:39:23,830
- Sir!
- What the hell!

2317
02:39:24,120 --> 02:39:26,160
Do you even know who I am?
I am a Minister!

2318
02:39:26,200 --> 02:39:27,370
Of which city exactly?

2319
02:39:27,410 --> 02:39:28,500
This city!

2320
02:39:28,660 --> 02:39:30,700
Don't you follow news and politics?

2321
02:39:30,750 --> 02:39:32,540
After marrying her...

2322
02:39:32,580 --> 02:39:35,450
After having witnessed the
conspiracies around them...

2323
02:39:35,500 --> 02:39:37,410
State Politics don't
stand a chance.

2324
02:39:37,580 --> 02:39:41,410
- Minister, I got married at the age of 14.
- Stop it. Just stop it!

2325
02:39:45,540 --> 02:39:47,500
- Go.
- Let's go! Move!

2326
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:52,000
There he is.

2327
02:39:54,500 --> 02:39:58,620
Hey! Why are you leaving me behind?
-Why are you leaving me and going?

2328
02:39:58,620 --> 02:40:00,160
- I need clarity.
-Even I need clarity.

2329
02:40:00,160 --> 02:40:01,250
- Actually…
-Actually...

2330
02:40:01,290 --> 02:40:03,450
- Why are you harassing me?
-Why are you harassing me?

2331
02:40:03,540 --> 02:40:06,830
We're talking about my life here. -We're
talking about my daughter's life here.

2332
02:40:06,870 --> 02:40:08,660
How are you related to him?
- He is going to be my daughter's husband.

2333
02:40:08,750 --> 02:40:10,160
He has already become my husband.

2334
02:40:10,540 --> 02:40:12,580
Son-in-laws visit every
Sankranthi festival in Kurnool.

2335
02:40:12,750 --> 02:40:14,500
This Sankranthi, it's your
husband and my hell breaker.

2336
02:40:14,540 --> 02:40:16,750
I let you talk before, right?
Now it's my turn.

2337
02:40:16,750 --> 02:40:18,700
You let me talk before, right?
Let me talk now as well.

2338
02:40:18,750 --> 02:40:21,290
I have important things to discuss.
- I also have important things to discuss!

2339
02:40:21,580 --> 02:40:22,620
No… I’ll talk first.

2340
02:40:22,790 --> 02:40:23,830
Stop it!

2341
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:26,910
If he's irritated, he'll leave
a dent on yet another vase.

2342
02:40:27,040 --> 02:40:28,160
Thanks, sir!

2343
02:40:28,410 --> 02:40:29,410
Do something for me.

2344
02:40:29,660 --> 02:40:31,790
Pull each other's hair and fight.

2345
02:40:32,040 --> 02:40:34,040
Whoever wins can come talk to me.

2346
02:40:34,160 --> 02:40:36,160
Come on! Let's go!

2347
02:40:36,580 --> 02:40:37,580
What shall we do now?

2348
02:40:37,580 --> 02:40:40,620
Let's take a vote.
Whoever gets the majority can talk to him.

2349
02:40:40,700 --> 02:40:42,620
- Do you get it?
- Of course!

2350
02:40:42,660 --> 02:40:44,620
There's 10 of you and 4 of us.
You're going to win unanimously.

2351
02:40:44,620 --> 02:40:46,000
How long are you going to talk?

2352
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:47,410
- 5 minutes.
- I just need 2 minutes.

2353
02:40:47,450 --> 02:40:49,620
- We will only take one minute.
- This is what I call house politics.

2354
02:40:50,290 --> 02:40:51,290
Okay, go.

2355
02:40:53,000 --> 02:40:53,910
Son...

2356
02:40:54,120 --> 02:40:55,790
She won’t accept any
alliance that I suggest.

2357
02:40:56,000 --> 02:40:58,830
She wants to travel
with you for lifetime.

2358
02:40:58,830 --> 02:41:01,750
I couldn't handle one day
train journey with your family.

2359
02:41:01,870 --> 02:41:03,830
Life long journey with her?
I can't do it!

2360
02:41:03,830 --> 02:41:06,500
Mother! Do something and
convince him to say yes.

2361
02:41:06,580 --> 02:41:09,080
What comes after alphabets o,p,q,r?

2362
02:41:09,200 --> 02:41:11,660
S!
- He said yes! He said yes!

2363
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:14,370
Don’t use these foolish tricks on me.

2364
02:41:14,370 --> 02:41:15,910
Since you are requesting so much...

2365
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,870
Mr. Prasad, find a pretty army girl for me.
- Hey!

2366
02:41:19,830 --> 02:41:21,290
Don't you get it?

2367
02:41:21,950 --> 02:41:23,540
You're being arrogant because
you're good looking, huh?

2368
02:41:24,370 --> 02:41:26,250
Don't assume I'll leave you alone.

2369
02:41:26,450 --> 02:41:29,410
If you marry anyone other
than me, I will kill her.

2370
02:41:29,660 --> 02:41:33,080
If they force me to marry anyone
other than you, I will kill him too.

2371
02:41:34,000 --> 02:41:35,540
I am madly in love with you.

2372
02:41:36,540 --> 02:41:38,080
Do you get it?

2373
02:41:38,120 --> 02:41:39,870
- Listen to me.
- Hush!

2374
02:41:40,410 --> 02:41:44,250
You're being such a show off.
That's not even the problem.

2375
02:41:44,870 --> 02:41:45,910
Because you look good.

2376
02:41:47,830 --> 02:41:49,160
But a guy like you...

2377
02:41:49,290 --> 02:41:52,370
Never before! Ever after!

2378
02:41:56,750 --> 02:42:00,500
She appears to be a nice girl.
Accept her.

2379
02:42:01,830 --> 02:42:04,450
Okay. I have to get
married sometime, right?

2380
02:42:04,950 --> 02:42:07,910
Mr. Prasad, ask them to fix an
auspicious time and let us know.

2381
02:42:08,080 --> 02:42:09,040
Done.

2382
02:42:09,830 --> 02:42:13,370
Wow! I'm impressed!
-Wait. Wait.

2383
02:42:13,370 --> 02:42:15,120
We're in public.
And we're not married yet.

2384
02:42:15,450 --> 02:42:16,790
What are you looking at?
Stop her, sir.

2385
02:42:16,790 --> 02:42:17,910
Come. Let's go.

2386
02:42:17,950 --> 02:42:20,370
Now that your family has
got a happy ending...

2387
02:42:20,540 --> 02:42:21,580
Leave.

2388
02:42:22,290 --> 02:42:24,830
You were so patient earlier.
Show the same patience with me.

2389
02:42:25,580 --> 02:42:26,830
Why are you leaving me and going?

2390
02:42:26,950 --> 02:42:28,330
You and I can't work it out.

2391
02:42:28,660 --> 02:42:29,910
Go to hell and I don't care.

2392
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:31,160
I am going to Kashmir.

2393
02:42:31,160 --> 02:42:33,290
Mom, we'll have the wedding in Kurnool.
And the honeymoon in Kashmir.

2394
02:42:33,290 --> 02:42:33,950
Do you get it?

2395
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:37,000
If you are leaving me and going, you must
have planned something for sure. Tell me.

2396
02:42:37,120 --> 02:42:39,950
There's no plan. Leave me alone.
I'm going to Kashmir.

2397
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:43,040
- Do I look like a fool? What is the plan?
-Why are you shouting?

2398
02:42:43,250 --> 02:42:46,000
- I said there is no plan!
- Madam... Madam...

2399
02:42:46,910 --> 02:42:49,750
I made a mistake. I'm sorry. Forgive me.

2400
02:42:50,080 --> 02:42:53,120
Tell me what his plan is.
-I don’t know what plans he has.

2401
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,040
But, I know your future.
-What do you mean?

2402
02:42:56,200 --> 02:43:00,200
You must do right by everyone
you have caused loss to.

2403
02:43:00,200 --> 02:43:02,290
- How?
- He asked me not to tell you.

2404
02:43:03,450 --> 02:43:06,410
Everyone here is playing it smart.
Everyone knows.

2405
02:43:07,200 --> 02:43:10,330
He has evidence against me and yet, he's
leaving me behind and going to Kashmir.

2406
02:43:10,370 --> 02:43:12,870
There is some plan!
I don’t believe him.

2407
02:43:16,370 --> 02:43:18,750
You're not going to slip, are you?

2408
02:43:19,330 --> 02:43:22,790
If you don’t tell me what the plan
is, I'll take this knife and...

2409
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:24,040
Hold the bag for me.

2410
02:43:24,410 --> 02:43:26,250
What are you going to
do with the knife? Huh?

2411
02:43:26,370 --> 02:43:29,540
Will you at least hear me out?
I will kill myself with this knife.

2412
02:43:29,580 --> 02:43:30,620
I will not let that happen.

2413
02:43:30,620 --> 02:43:32,580
You're one of those lives I protect.

2414
02:43:32,580 --> 02:43:34,160
You're good at this sweet talk.

2415
02:43:36,120 --> 02:43:37,120
Let's go, Mr. Prasad.

2416
02:43:37,370 --> 02:43:38,750
You are going to Kashmir, huh?

2417
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:42,040
This train will not move until
you tell me what the plan is.

2418
02:43:42,250 --> 02:43:45,330
Hey! I will not let this train move!

2419
02:43:45,830 --> 02:43:48,950
I'll not let you go without
telling me what the plan is.

2420
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:57,370
What is this?

2421
02:43:57,500 --> 02:43:58,950
Your ticket to Kashmir.

2422
02:43:59,450 --> 02:44:00,950
You are coming to Kashmir with us.

2423
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:02,290
What will I do in Kashmir?

2424
02:44:03,250 --> 02:44:07,450
I thought for 2 days as to how to
make my rat feel the responsibility.

2425
02:44:07,830 --> 02:44:10,370
If I submit witness in court
where will you go after that?

2426
02:44:10,580 --> 02:44:11,750
You will go to jail.

2427
02:44:12,370 --> 02:44:13,580
As a VIP inmate.

2428
02:44:13,870 --> 02:44:18,160
You'll have a TV, fridge, good
food, bed, meetings, settlements...

2429
02:44:18,160 --> 02:44:19,790
In two months you will come out
on bail, start a campaign...

2430
02:44:19,830 --> 02:44:21,000
And you will become a leader again.

2431
02:44:21,160 --> 02:44:22,370
What's going to bring a change in you?

2432
02:44:23,370 --> 02:44:25,450
That is why I am taking you to the army.

2433
02:44:25,950 --> 02:44:28,790
You'll be trained in the army
for 3 months from tomorrow.

2434
02:44:29,040 --> 02:44:30,870
You are selected for the Indian army.

2435
02:44:33,040 --> 02:44:34,370
This is your plan?

2436
02:44:35,080 --> 02:44:38,660
A 50 year old in the military
for training? Seriously?

2437
02:44:38,750 --> 02:44:40,450
- You have to change, right?
- How will that happen?

2438
02:44:40,620 --> 02:44:44,450
You have to get up at 4 am,
carry ten kilos sand bag...

2439
02:44:44,500 --> 02:44:46,410
And run 100 laps in the ground.

2440
02:44:49,410 --> 02:44:51,200
How can I do that at this age?

2441
02:44:51,660 --> 02:44:53,660
It will be 2 am by the time I
have a drink and doze off.

2442
02:44:53,750 --> 02:44:54,950
How can I wake up at 4?

2443
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,450
You'll have to make another 100 laps
as punishment if you fail to wake up.

2444
02:44:57,450 --> 02:44:59,200
Hey, I will wake up.
Why wouldn't I?

2445
02:44:59,330 --> 02:45:01,700
After all these activities are done,
at sharp 7’o clock…

2446
02:45:01,910 --> 02:45:03,500
You'll have a small breakfast
according to the menu.

2447
02:45:03,580 --> 02:45:05,370
So little breakfast
after running so much?

2448
02:45:05,620 --> 02:45:07,250
I can rest after eating, right?

2449
02:45:07,330 --> 02:45:09,700
If you rest, who will clean
the ground that you ran on?

2450
02:45:09,790 --> 02:45:11,200
Who will sweep the roads
that you walked on?

2451
02:45:11,330 --> 02:45:12,830
Who will wash the clothes you've worn?

2452
02:45:12,870 --> 02:45:14,540
Who will clean the toilets you used?

2453
02:45:22,750 --> 02:45:25,290
By the time all this is done,
it will be lunch time.

2454
02:45:25,330 --> 02:45:27,580
- Will they serve a good quantity at lunch?
- Of course.

2455
02:45:27,830 --> 02:45:30,660
According to the menu...
-Lunch is also so little.

2456
02:45:31,290 --> 02:45:33,000
Never mind. I will eat and sleep

2457
02:45:33,200 --> 02:45:35,410
You're not the Minister anymore
to sleep whenever you want.

2458
02:45:35,700 --> 02:45:37,200
You are going through army training.

2459
02:45:37,410 --> 02:45:39,450
Actual drill starts now.

2460
02:45:39,750 --> 02:45:43,870
Climbing, dragging tyres,
jumping down ropes, trekking...

2461
02:45:43,910 --> 02:45:47,290
Climbing down hill, crawling on your
elbows, walking on your knees...

2462
02:45:47,290 --> 02:45:51,660
They torture you for 5 hours
straight until you're out of breath.

2463
02:45:53,450 --> 02:45:54,750
Are you humans?

2464
02:45:55,160 --> 02:45:57,660
You call this training? I will die.

2465
02:45:57,660 --> 02:46:00,290
By the time that feeling
hits you, it is dinner time.

2466
02:46:00,330 --> 02:46:03,500
Yeah, right! Like it's a lavish dinner.
They'll serve so little as usual.

2467
02:46:04,080 --> 02:46:05,700
Never mind. I'll eat some and sleep.

2468
02:46:05,910 --> 02:46:07,500
Who's going to do your
duty if you fall asleep?

2469
02:46:09,450 --> 02:46:11,450
What have I been doing since morning?

2470
02:46:11,500 --> 02:46:12,660
That was just warm up.

2471
02:46:13,040 --> 02:46:14,580
Actual duty starts now.

2472
02:46:14,870 --> 02:46:18,660
You must hold the gun without
blinking an eye in freezing cold.

2473
02:46:19,120 --> 02:46:20,870
Anyone might attack from the sky.

2474
02:46:20,870 --> 02:46:22,620
Anyone might plant a bomb under you.

2475
02:46:22,660 --> 02:46:25,500
Anyone might shoot you from the
front and stab you from behind.

2476
02:46:25,620 --> 02:46:30,160
You have to guard the borders while
you catch a sense of death 24X7.

2477
02:46:33,330 --> 02:46:35,450
This is what army
training is all about.

2478
02:46:36,040 --> 02:46:39,950
You have to work till you
drop for 3 months straight.

2479
02:46:39,950 --> 02:46:42,580
Then you will forget the notion of 'I' and
dedicate yourself completely to the nation.

2480
02:46:42,910 --> 02:46:45,500
When you see the flag, you will
feel a vibration in your body.

2481
02:46:48,370 --> 02:46:51,000
You will remember your responsibility
every time you think of making a mistake.

2482
02:46:51,450 --> 02:46:54,040
You'll feel like grabbing someone's
collar when they make a mistake.

2483
02:46:56,580 --> 02:46:58,700
This is called patriotism.

2484
02:47:00,580 --> 02:47:01,830
Not just you.

2485
02:47:02,330 --> 02:47:07,830
If we train any leader or officer in any
service for 6 months in the Army...

2486
02:47:08,080 --> 02:47:09,330
Why would they make a mistake?

2487
02:47:11,200 --> 02:47:14,250
The life I am saving is
headed to Kashmir now.

2488
02:47:42,540 --> 02:47:44,160
Congratulations, Mr. Nagendra!

2489
02:47:44,700 --> 02:47:46,160
Your training is complete.
-Thank you, sir.

2490
02:47:46,620 --> 02:47:48,120
How do you feel now, sir?

2491
02:47:48,500 --> 02:47:50,620
When I put this uniform on, I feel...

2492
02:47:50,750 --> 02:47:52,500
- Respect!
-Respect!

2493
02:47:53,120 --> 02:47:55,450
When I see that flag, I feel a...

2494
02:47:55,750 --> 02:47:57,290
Vibration!
-Vibration!

2495
02:47:57,830 --> 02:48:00,950
When someone makes a mistake, I
want to grab his collar and...

2496
02:48:00,950 --> 02:48:02,620
I want to...
-I mean...

2497
02:48:03,290 --> 02:48:04,330
Patriotism

2498
02:48:05,580 --> 02:48:06,870
Thank you! Thank you!

2499
02:48:06,950 --> 02:48:09,620
To your hard work, efforts
and determination...

2500
02:48:09,700 --> 02:48:10,620
Take a bow!

2501
02:48:10,830 --> 02:48:12,250
Here are the cheques
addressed to all of you.

2502
02:48:12,580 --> 02:48:14,950
I want to compensate for the
loss I've caused to you.

2503
02:48:15,250 --> 02:48:16,620
You first. Come on.

2504
02:48:17,040 --> 02:48:18,540
Think of me as your son.

2505
02:48:18,750 --> 02:48:20,540
Here's your money.

2506
02:48:23,410 --> 02:48:25,120
You're all the lives I protect.

2507
02:48:25,370 --> 02:48:26,830
We are sacrificing our
lives for you back there.

2508
02:48:26,830 --> 02:48:28,410
But you are so indisciplined here.

2509
02:48:28,540 --> 02:48:29,620
Aren't you supposed to be responsible?

2510
02:48:29,790 --> 02:48:31,870
Hey, everybody! Stand in a line!

2511
02:48:32,410 --> 02:48:35,750
If you don't listen, vases
will turn in to pots.

2512
02:48:41,750 --> 02:48:43,120
Hold on. Hold on.

2513
02:48:43,500 --> 02:48:45,620
How come you've turned
so soft all of a sudden?

2514
02:48:45,830 --> 02:48:49,700
Let's give our audience some energy
and entertainment before they leave.

2515
02:48:49,830 --> 02:48:51,620
Wow!

2516
02:48:51,830 --> 02:48:53,250
Great audience like you...

2517
02:48:53,290 --> 02:48:55,950
Never before! Ever after!

2518
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:12,080
Dad...

2519
02:49:12,410 --> 02:49:15,370
What should I do to become
like Alluri Sitaramaraju?

2520
02:49:18,160 --> 02:49:20,160
You should go to the border.

2521
02:49:21,450 --> 02:49:23,450
You should become a soldier.
