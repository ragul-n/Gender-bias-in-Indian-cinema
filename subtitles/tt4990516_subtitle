1
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,250
<i>Hey, look.</i>

2
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,580
<i>-Look.-Yes, right.</i>

3
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,040
<i>Just look at him.</i>

4
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,210
Bite him.

5
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,040
This is the story of my life.

6
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:37,160
No, this is the story of every Indian man.
You are barked at all your life.

7
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,920
This happens at my office every day.

8
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,740
No, this dog is like
a present-day politician

9
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,780
who won't let the public live in peace.

10
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:46,280
Go to hell.

11
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,040
-Come on, let's go.
-Let's go.

12
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,710
Do you think he has a girlfriend?

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,170
More like four girlfriends and two wives.
What has he got to worry about?

14
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,500
Playboy.

15
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,870
Mr. Arjun, we were waiting
for your comment on the dog.

16
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,370
Forget the dog, who were you guys
comparing yourselves to?

17
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,420
-You are right, maybe we are dogs.
-Stop it.

18
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,830
Not Arjun though, he's a nice guy.

19
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,830
Very nice!

20
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,080
Hey, Arjun, you should go
to the church with my mom.

21
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,280
A nice guy certified
by Mr. Jayesh Garodia.

22
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,280
Careful.

23
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,160
-We're useless
-Pass the ball.

24
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,790
Go ahead and take my ass now.

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,880
Tell you what, Jayesh.

26
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:29,590
You should hold a procession for Arjun
during the next <i>Navaratri </i>festival.

27
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,620
All right?

28
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,080
Well said.

29
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,410
-Hail Arjun, the great.
-Hail.

30
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,750
Hail Arjun, the great.

31
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,030
-Hail.
-Hail, Arjun...

32
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,420
Hey.

33
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:42,660
Are you all right?

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,840
Are you fine?

35
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,330
He is all right, let's go.

36
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:49,280
-Sorry, sir.
-Let's go.

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,030
-Take the ball.
-He is fine, let's go.

38
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,240
Let's go.

39
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,740
Dude, I didn't see him at all.

40
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,950
What's this? Do you know?

41
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,290
-Are you all right?
-I am fine.

42
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,740
Arjun, I barely touched him.

43
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:04,660
He's okay, let's go.

44
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:06,280
I don't know.

45
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,370
Let's go, Arjun.

46
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,620
I don't know. He's saying...

47
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,700
Watch where you kick the ball.

48
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,780
-Come on. What the hell?
-Come on, Arjun.What's taking you so long?

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,370
-Ball.
-I want to play soccer,

50
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,840
-come on, let's go.
-Come on.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,130
I was really worried there.
The way he fell when I bumped into him.

52
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,450
But he is a strange old man.

53
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,490
-Soccer?
-There he goes again.

54
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,280
-Arjun, let's go.
-Arjun.

55
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,490
-Shit.
-Come on.

56
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,410
Hey!

57
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,330
Listen to the nice guy. Come.

58
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,790
Look what the nice guy is up to.

59
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,240
-Why are you bringing him along?
-Ball.

60
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:42,280
Hey, bring this along.

61
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,490
Who needs this hassle?

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,460
-What happened?
-But why?

63
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,910
It's okay.

64
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,170
Sorry.

65
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,330
Three, two, one. Go!

66
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,580
-Hey! Pass!
-Go ahead! Pass on.

67
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,990
-Abhi! Pass.
-Hey! Pass.

68
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,130
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

69
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:49,090
Goalie! Goalie! Strike a goal!
Goalie! Goalie! Kick!

70
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,080
-Arjun! Please talk to him!
-Stay calm, sir.

71
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,280
Where did you get him from?

72
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,580
Come on, let's go!

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,340
Jeez, move!

74
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,030
He's going right! It's no use! Damn!

75
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,700
-Come on, faster. Come on.
-Come on. Pass.

76
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,130
Come on. You, stand over there.

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,740
Come on.

78
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,240
-Hey! Goal! Goal!
-Who's this man?

79
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,830
Pass the soccer. Pass the soccer.
Dancing like this and... goal! Goal!

80
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,750
-Pass it. Pass it.
-I caught you!

81
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,160
I scored a goal like this!

82
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,830
-Pass it. Pass it.
-Play! Play! Play!

83
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,530
Run properly. What are you doing?

84
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,040
-Throw it back.
-Give the ball.

85
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,490
-Ball?
-Give us the ball, sir.

86
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,420
-Please, sir.
-Sir.

87
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,490
-Don't run.
-He's taking the ball with him.

88
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:07,910
-Hey! Hello! Run! Ball!
-Where is he going?

89
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:20,880
CLEAN JUHU INITIATIVE

90
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,870
Ball.

91
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,580
-Go and catch them.
-Bhoir! Come on!

92
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,080
Bhoir, where are you going?

93
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:49,030
<i>The senior officer is already there so goand back him up. You should charge him</i>

94
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,580
-<i>under section 2445 and 516...</i>
-Shit.

95
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,740
<i>He needs to see what exactly can be done.</i>

96
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,030
-Shit. Shit.
-<i>No, but... hello?</i>

97
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,620
<i>Who's it? Charlie.Where is Charlie? Ask him to look into it.</i>

98
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,250
<i>Charlie. Charlie.Tell Charlie to go there.</i>

99
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,870
Come on, just button up.

100
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,160
<i>Please check if there's a caseof robbery in that area.</i>

101
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,950
-Come, he wants to see you.
-Hey, but...

102
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,670
It's all your fault. Madam got hit.
She has filed a complaint.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,840
She complained against you guys.
You play here often.

104
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,530
Hey, what's going on? Hold on.
What's going on?

105
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,490
-What's your name?
-I'll look into this. Come on.

106
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,780
Get in. Come on.

107
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:31,450
Get in.

108
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,740
Soccer? Play behind bars now.

109
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,490
Is this what educated people do?

110
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,410
Get inside.

111
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,870
Is this a place to play soccer?

112
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:41,630
Get in quick.

113
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,790
Mind your feet.

114
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,870
-I'll speak to them.
-Okay.

115
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,660
He was asking our names.

116
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,910
If we tell him our names,
we will get defamed.

117
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,620
Carry on then. No sweat.

118
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,710
Sir, what about ma'am?

119
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,290
That's right. You can look after her.
I'll look after these guys.

120
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:01,200
-Okay.
-Okay?

121
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,280
Wow, <i>Dirty Harry.</i>

122
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,460
Look at his style.

123
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,490
Stop laughing. He is watching us.

124
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,490
-Do you keep chilled beers in here?
-Definitely.

125
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,040
Hey, wait!

126
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,960
Give me the evidence.

127
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,660
It's no big deal.
Things will cool down by tomorrow.

128
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:36,870
That's what I said.

129
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,960
You guys don't know that witch.

130
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:39,990
Which witch?

131
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,420
Kamana Sayani, the one who got hit.

132
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,340
I see.

133
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:46,330
She's the president
of our Juhu Citizen's Association.

134
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,580
She has been winning elections unopposed
for four years in a row.

135
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,280
She is definitely like Hitler.

136
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,830
If she's winning unopposed,
you stand against her.

137
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,030
Maybe you'll win.

138
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,660
Jayesh Garodia, President,
Juhu Beach Citizen's Association.

139
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,630
Good idea, Arjun.

140
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,120
-My vote is with you.
-Thank you.

141
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,030
Mine as well.

142
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,990
See, two votes.

143
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,120
All because of this old man.

144
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,410
I told you, don't bring him along.

145
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,370
-Arjun, you rascal.
-Bloody Arjun.

146
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,910
Why did you have to tag him along?

147
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,130
Poor thing.

148
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:15,160
Anyway, the day is ruined.
What do we do for the rest of the day?

149
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,250
Go home early. Give your wife
and kids a nice surprise.

150
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,370
Surprise? They'll annoy me!

151
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:25,000
Mr. Jayesh, get close to your wife...

152
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,540
and say something romantic in Gujarati.

153
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,780
What nonsense!

154
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,530
You are sorted.

155
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,030
Every day you take a new girl
for a spin on your motorcycle.

156
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,660
-Something's burning.
-Something's burning.

157
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,660
I think he's talking
in some South Indian language.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,920
-Anna, just check what he is saying.
-Hey, sir.

159
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,240
Sir, I'm busy.

160
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,030
Don't you also blabber the same way?

161
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,290
I speak Tullu, this is not Tullu!

162
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:05,620
-We pissed him off.
-It's Tamil. He's speaking in Tamil.

163
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,660
Please translate
his words in Hindi for us.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,920
-He keeps repeating some numbers.
-What numbers?

165
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,240
Bhoir, can I have a sip?

166
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,830
Please do.
I have a minor TB infection, that's all.

167
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,630
Seven, eight, nine, eight...

168
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,620
Probably a cell phone number.

169
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,130
-No, he's okay.
-Anna, get the tab.

170
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,460
-Anna!
-Just message me your address...

171
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,630
Take this away if you don't want to die.

172
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,200
Don't you dare take money from them.

173
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,790
Bawa, will you come along?

174
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,920
Have you lost it?

175
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,780
We take him home and for all you know,
we might get sued.

176
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,380
For making a crazy old man play soccer.

177
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,530
-Domi?
-Yes?

178
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,410
I left my keys at home.

179
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,490
I've got something lined up.

180
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,210
Don't even look at me. I'm working.

181
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,250
This is your work?

182
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,200
-How about you?
-Didn't I escort you guys here?

183
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:14,040
I'll go to the movies
and catch up on my sleep.

184
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,200
But you won't go home.

185
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:18,870
What a sad world.
Nobody wants to help a nice guy.

186
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,910
Arjun, I had warned you
against dragging him along.

187
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,330
What did he say? â€œListen to the nice guy.â€

188
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,660
This old man is going to turn you
into a dog. Understand?

189
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,410
Goodness! Where did you run off to?

190
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,740
You...

191
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:44,700
You...

192
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:47,370
Please come in.

193
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,240
I hope you are not hurt.
Is everything fine?

194
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,620
-Did he hurt himself?
-No.

195
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,450
-Where did you find him?
-Juhu Beach.

196
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,330
Juhu Beach?

197
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,790
Is he your husband?

198
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,280
Do I look that old?

199
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,990
Do I look that old?

200
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,280
I live on the second floor.
When Kavi came crying...

201
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,580
-Kavi, your dad is here.
-Wait, I'll just call you back.

202
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,530
Where did you go?

203
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,780
I've told you...

204
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,490
Didn't I tell you not to leave the house?

205
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,200
Dad, why do you do this?

206
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,280
Are you okay?

207
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:33,450
Dad!

208
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,830
You brought him here?
I really don't know how to thank you.

209
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:40,830
Usually, I'm careful, it's just that
the stupid maid left the door open and...

210
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,580
It's okay. He knew the number, so...

211
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,880
Yeah, thankfully that's one thing
that he remembers.

212
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,950
Dad, what did you do?

213
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,660
I'll never talk to you I'm telling you.

214
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:50,700
-Arjun.
-Just...

215
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,330
I'm Arjun Anand.

216
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,240
I'm Kavi. Kavya Ranganathan.

217
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,660
Kavi, I shall leave.

218
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,620
Yes. Thank you, Ms. Aparna.

219
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't be silly. Be careful now.

220
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,170
-Okay.
-Something is burning on the stove.

221
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,450
Goal!

222
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,740
Foul.

223
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,490
Thanks.

224
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,380
I don't know what is wrong with him today.

225
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,950
I'm a nice guy.

226
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,420
Nice guy!

227
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,880
What happened? You are home early.

228
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,420
So what happened today?
Earthquake or something?

229
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,370
Everything is okay? What happened?

230
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:44,380
Nothing.

231
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,620
"Earth, stars, planets, everything else."

232
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,780
Anyway, it's good that you came early.

233
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,040
Sit. I need to talk to you.

234
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,710
I'm not involved.

235
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,990
What is it?

236
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,920
You should sit first. Come here.

237
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,580
My teensy-weensy baby brother.

238
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,340
-I see.
-Hey.

239
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,200
Listen, if you're not involved,
don't get involved.

240
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,370
-Butt out.
-Okay.

241
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,170
You know the Poddars,
the business entrepreneurs?

242
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,540
One of the Poddar brother's daughter
is in Shipra's class.

243
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,660
she was telling me how her husband

244
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,670
can't find anybody to head
the retail venture and all that.

245
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,250
And I told her about you

246
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,580
and your qualifications.
And she was really impressed.

247
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,170
-What?
-Hey, should I leave this house?

248
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,630
What do you want to do in life?

249
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,120
What do you mean? I want to be happy.
What else?

250
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,910
Don't you feel like doing something?

251
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,130
Shu, I am doing something.

252
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,750
Like what? Soccer? And your consultancy?

253
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,590
You haven't paid that last dairy client.

254
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:05,620
Shu, I'm making money.

255
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,950
-I see.
-I'm happy.

256
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,960
Okay.

257
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,330
I tried all those things and all I managed
to be was busy all the time.

258
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,700
Is this the kind of example
you want to set for Shipra?

259
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,660
Do as you please. Just be happy.

260
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,420
Shu, I want Shipra to be responsible,

261
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,990
but you're taking things
a bit too seriously.

262
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,120
She's pushed too hard anyway.

263
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,170
Even the fun things she does
are competitive.

264
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,630
-Leave.
-At least ask brother-in-law.

265
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,840
She's asking me to leave.

266
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,200
She's asking me to leave.

267
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,790
Look, don't drag me into this.

268
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,130
This is your home too.

269
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,950
And by the way,

270
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:55,790
Shipra, it's time for your skating class.

271
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,530
Let's skip today.

272
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,950
Parineeta and Shama are on level two.
You're still on level one.

273
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
Miss! Give the flour to be done later on.

274
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,410
Come on!

275
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,630
Here.

276
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,580
Boss, next time don't come early.

277
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,950
Now, I'm going to whip your ass.

278
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,620
Yes, what is a life if full of...

279
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:28,080
"What is a life of full..."

280
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,990
Shipu.

281
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,450
Oh...

282
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,340
Fudge.

283
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,920
Are we out of fudge?

284
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Besides, I've been transferred
to Saputara.

285
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,540
Sorry, Bhoir, because of us...

286
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,240
<i>No, it's not your fault.</i>

287
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,210
<i>It was her picture in the mediathat really drove her wild.</i>

288
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:25,370
So what's your plan now?

289
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,450
I'm single and free as a bird.

290
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,710
And to be honest,
Mumbai is going to the dogs.

291
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,410
Even a pickpocket
has connections in the Ministry.

292
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,210
Mr. Arjun Anand, can we
get on with the presentation?

293
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,290
-Yes. Okay, I'll call you later.
<i>-All right.</i>

294
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,370
<i>Take care. Bye.</i>

295
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,700
Okay, so we'll start with
the basic brand architecture.

296
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,630
And we'll move on to
the presentation on branding.

297
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,780
Papa, he's not giving me the big gun!

298
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,040
Papa!

299
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,700
You boys keep quiet,
don't disturb your father.

300
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,830
Hey!

301
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,740
Here, take blessings.

302
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,450
-It's mine.
-No. The bigger gun is mine.

303
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,960
-It's mine.
-No. Dad!

304
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,920
Praise Lord Krishna.

305
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
-Dad!
-Mom!

306
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,920
What's going on?

307
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,380
Is the Silichem invoicing done?

308
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:57,950
They're ready.

309
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,160
You have enough work, I hope.

310
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,620
If not, let me know.

311
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,590
I'll give you more work.

312
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,370
No, there's enough.

313
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,780
Then go do it.

314
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,530
Happy birthday.

315
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,250
Excuse me!

316
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,780
Sir, there is only abuse in this letter.
No threats.

317
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,830
Sir, there will be a problem...

318
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,040
No problem. I will get it done.
You just let me know.

319
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:47,030
Mom, what is all this?

320
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:48,840
What?

321
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,990
What is all this?
You've been cooking since morning?

322
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,870
Last three nights,
you've been coming home late.

323
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:56,080
You've not had any dinner.
You should eat properly now.

324
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,540
So what? You're giving me
three nights' leftover?

325
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,660
Right! Keep quiet and start eating, okay?

326
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,240
Sit down.

327
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,910
Domi, why don't you tell me
where you usually go at night?

328
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,450
I'm not a baby, Mom.

329
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,130
-Give some more gravy.
-Yes.

330
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,620
No peas, I want only gravy.

331
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,450
-Yes, I'm giving you.
-Enough.

332
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,750
Sausage. That's it.

333
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:22,660
â€œNot a baby.â€

334
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,450
But I'm still your mother.

335
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:26,910
I worry about you every night.

336
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,090
Do you even care?
You only know how to enjoy.

337
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,870
Don't be a drama queen, Mom.

338
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,780
In Bollywood movies
the sons love their moms.

339
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,750
My miserable luck!

340
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,030
One of my sons goes to Dubai
and the other one goes out at night.

341
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,120
God knows what sins I'm paying for.

342
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,240
Yes, Jayesh?

343
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,830
Yes?

344
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,460
I'll call you later.

345
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,910
Okay.

346
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,910
From the time you were little,
you two only fought.

347
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,950
-If your father was alive...
-Don't be a drama queen, Mom.

348
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,080
Drama queen? That's not who I am.

349
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,950
I want to leave everything
and go to Goa in peace.

350
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,130
Please go, am I stopping you?

351
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,410
Right.

352
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:27,200
-Get married and then I'll go.
-Again?

353
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,080
Every time you ask me to get married.

354
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,280
Why do you want me to get married? Why?

355
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:34,250
My dear, Teresa's son
has three children already.

356
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,530
What can I do, Mom?

357
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,490
What can I do?

358
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,950
Every Sunday at the church, people ask me,

359
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,920
â€œIs something wrong with Domi?

360
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,920
Why isn't he getting married?"

361
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,790
What do I tell them?

362
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:46,700
Tell them to get lost.

363
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,870
The girls will tell you to get lost
when you want to get married.

364
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,240
What will you do then?

365
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,160
Get lost.

366
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:57,950
Then you marry me, okay?

367
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,130
No way!

368
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,780
You marry me!

369
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,460
What trash are you talking, Domi?

370
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,780
You marry me, right?

371
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:04,840
Domi.

372
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,950
Domi!

373
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:11,700
Next Sunday be at home
when your brother is there. Understand?

374
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,080
No!

375
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,780
-Go.
-What?

376
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,740
Go upstairs.

377
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,920
Wow, it's so dark. Where is this?

378
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,990
To your right.

379
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,620
-You live here?
-Just hold on.

380
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,280
What?

381
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,160
Isn't it cool?

382
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,490
Come, let's make a bigger mess
and then we will go for a movie.

383
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,700
No, I have to go.

384
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,330
No way.

385
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,170
The hostel closes by 11 p.m.,
it's 10:30 p.m. already. I have to go.

386
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,280
Then stay over.
Leave early in the morning.

387
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,490
-No.
-Please.

388
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,960
Everyone's seen me leave in these clothes.
I can't go back like this.

389
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:37,990
So what?

390
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,880
What would people think?

391
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,210
They wouldn't be wrong, would they be?

392
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,580
No, please.

393
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,990
I have a great idea!

394
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,790
What took you so long?

395
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,660
My uncle wouldn't leave.
You think this is easy?

396
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,540
Don't give me that crap.

397
00:25:55,870 --> 00:25:58,160
Look, the day after is the return date.
By tomorrow...

398
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,340
-Okay.
-Come on.

399
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,370
Coming, baby. Coming.

400
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,590
Now go.

401
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:04,040
Please, the day after.

402
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,090
What is this?

403
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,910
Now you leave peacefully in the morning.
What will everyone think?

404
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,780
Arjun, I've been trying
to call everyone for so long.

405
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,450
No one is answering.

406
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:02,120
Look, we'll have to do something
about Sunday or else I'll...

407
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,130
-Can you taste this?
-Rishi took my remote.

408
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,700
-First class.
-Not too salty, right?

409
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,790
First class!

410
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:10,880
It's Thai curry.

411
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,200
Yes, it's first class.

412
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,200
Arjun, you tell me.

413
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:16,380
Should I look for a place?

414
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:19,240
Should I look for a place?

415
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:22,030
Can't we find a place to play, in Mumbai?

416
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,420
Run!

417
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,370
-Hey! This field is so nice.
-Come on, guys. Hurry up.

418
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,530
-Hey!
-What?

419
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,000
-There's a power cut.
-What the...

420
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,780
-What happened?
-The power tripped.

421
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:33,030
Saree. Nice!

422
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,380
Yes. It's just that he's not
comfortable with anyone else.

423
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:25,950
I know Sunday is off.
Just two hours? Is it not possible?

424
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,960
Whose wedding is it? Someone close?

425
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,870
Well, all right, then.

426
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,280
-Ball.
-Dad, stop it.

427
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,040
-Ball.
-I'm telling you I'll stop talking to you.

428
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:41,250
Quantum ball.

429
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Look, I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

430
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:12,450
I mean, Dad is not a big problem
or anything.

431
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,710
I have a nurse.

432
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:17,380
I have a nurse for six days a week.
Sundays, of course, I take care of him.

433
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,410
Actually, I wanted to thank you
for last Sunday.

434
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,790
It's just that I have this meeting
and I was trying to get out of...

435
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,410
Okay, hold on. Relax.

436
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,990
What you're saying is, this Sunday
something important has come up

437
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,990
and you want me
to take him to play soccer, right?

438
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,120
Don't speak, just move your head.
Yes or no?

439
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,780
Also, I don't know much about you.

440
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,170
Usually, it's the girl's dad who'd want
to know who she's going out with.

441
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,590
This is the complete opposite.

442
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:58,590
So young man, what are your intentions?

443
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,080
Didn't I say I'm a nice guy?

444
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:06,040
Yes, but who says that?
Like "I'm not a bad guy."

445
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,490
You ask me
whatever you want to know about me.

446
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:19,450
With every answer that impresses you,
put a coffee bean on my plate.

447
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,500
-Let's see how much I score.
-What rubbish!

448
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,000
Don't you like Nagpur?

449
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:42,830
I don't have any impression of it.

450
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,130
I stay at Pali Hill.

451
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,290
Oh, really? Alone?

452
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:15,240
Your score is still zero.

453
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,080
My own consultancy

454
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:20,660
The logo is very nice.

455
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,660
I should have carried an umbrella.

456
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:55,490
-Move now!
-Yes, sorry.

457
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:39,130
Domi.

458
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,210
Domi.

459
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,120
Where are you going, Domi?

460
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:02,580
Mom.

461
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,490
Mom.

462
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,950
What's got into you?

463
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,870
What do you mean?

464
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:37,120
How much was your uncle offering
to pay us?

465
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:39,090
Just peanuts.

466
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:45,120
I'm telling you, I won't let anyone
sell this house. Is that clear?

467
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,080
But this house belongs to me.
And no one was bothered to ask me.

468
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,740
Mom, please, keep your mouth shut.
I'm warning you.

469
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:55,660
Look at this freeloader.
What are you on about?

470
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:59,080
That's all we need, one more band member.

471
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,870
Me? A band member?

472
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,250
This is my house as well. I was born here.

473
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:04,530
Is that so?

474
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,960
That Dilnaaz from Kushrow Baug
just winked at you

475
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,710
and you were ready to gift
this house to her father.

476
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,710
-Am I right or wrong?
-Mind your language.

477
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,910
Hold on!

478
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,040
<i>Who cares?No one wants to look at your ugly mug.</i>

479
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,370
<i>Her whole familyis as straight as a corkscrew.</i>

480
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:27,240
<i>Don't say a word about my family.</i>

481
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,660
<i>You can't boil an egg. And the teayou prepare tastes like cow's piss.</i>

482
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:34,380
<i>That's what someonewith your class deserves.</i>

483
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,490
<i>Hey, freeloader, keep quiet.</i>

484
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:38,870
<i>You called me a freeloader?</i>

485
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:42,490
<i> And what's your husband?Rockfeller's right hand?</i>

486
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,240
<i>You high school dropout,shut your pie hole.</i>

487
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:50,030
<i>And I'm warning you,mind your language or else you're toast.</i>

488
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
What's with the cable?

489
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:53,330
No, it isn't working.

490
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,990
Where's Hari? Hello?

491
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:56,450
Hello?

492
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,280
<i>This accursed tongue you have.</i>

493
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:02,450
<i>If your brother shootswith an empty gun what can I do?</i>

494
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:06,830
<i>What can I do if you look like a monkey?</i>

495
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:08,580
<i>Blind fool.</i>

496
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,830
<i>You said, "We'll shift to Canada."I haven't even been to Khandala yet!</i>

497
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,660
<i>That's what someonewith your class deserves.</i>

498
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,630
<i>-You're talking about my class?-Yes.</i>

499
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,870
<i>You hairless mole. All those nightsyour parents wasted just for you.</i>

500
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,420
<i>What does that mean?</i>

501
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,880
<i>Just that your brain is rottingwith green yellow pus.</i>

502
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,490
<i>Your mother slept with every patientin an asylum.</i>

503
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:31,030
<i>to give birth to two samples like you.</i>

504
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,450
<i>-What? How dare you?-Hey.</i>

505
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,340
<i>I'll kill you. I swear.</i>

506
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,370
<i>Really? Touch me if you have the guts.</i>

507
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:44,120
<i>Look at her!! I'll chop you upinto 101 pieces. I'm telling you.</i>

508
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,120
<i>Try to touch meand I shall break your arms.</i>

509
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,910
<i>Leave her alone. She's baiting us.</i>

510
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,090
You scoundrel.

511
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:42,460
What are you up to?

512
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,450
We can hear you stomping all the way down.

513
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:47,750
I was chasing a rat.

514
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,120
How big was this rat?

515
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,700
Why did you come here? Go.

516
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,130
Go.

517
00:43:06,950 --> 00:43:07,780
Go!

518
00:43:16,870 --> 00:43:18,030
Now the kids are up.

519
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,960
Why don't you get a rattrap?

520
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:23,780
Or give me your cell phone number.

521
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,250
-What?
-Tell me.

522
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,870
Tell me the number, I'll remember.

523
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,910
The place I lived in earlier,
had many problems.

524
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,340
I'll send you the pest control number.
Everything got sorted.

525
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,420
So, tell me.

526
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,840
Nine, eight, two, double one,

527
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:39,330
three, five, eight, two, seven.

528
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,160
Nine, eight, two, double one,
three, five, eight, two, seven.

529
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,200
-Nine, eight, two, double one...
-Do you live downstairs?

530
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,530
What?

531
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,990
Just underneath your house.

532
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,420
There was loud stomping noise.

533
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,450
It's been a week since we took it on rent.

534
00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:54,830
Okay.

535
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,160
Nine, eight, two, double one,
three, five, eight, two, seven.

536
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,170
What's your name?

537
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,200
I'll send you a text message.

538
00:44:01,370 --> 00:44:02,370
You should sleep now.

539
00:44:03,830 --> 00:44:04,910
Let the rat to sleep too.

540
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,750
And let sleep too.

541
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:08,740
Good night.

542
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:11,330
Good night.

543
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:47,990
So, how do we play?

544
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,830
Punjab Society versus Juhu Beach?

545
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:54,530
It's five each?

546
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:56,340
No, we are six.

547
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,160
Who is he? Some uncle of yours?

548
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,340
Yes, maybe one of his relatives.

549
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,840
-Come on, now.
-Come, let me show you around.

550
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:08,250
We'll beat you ten-love.

551
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,380
Where's the place to play?

552
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,580
You douche, what's this man doing here?

553
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,500
This uncle just loves the game.

554
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,370
Rascal, just tell me what is going on.

555
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,160
Hey, look. A road roller.

556
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,490
What the...

557
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,410
This guy is fighting with
the housing society about the parking.

558
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,420
How's this?

559
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,090
We'll play here, all right?

560
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:35,700
Nice place, right?

561
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,330
Come on.

562
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,240
Punjab Society.

563
00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:40,580
This side.

564
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:46,700
-Gokul, come on. Play with us.
-What are you doing?

565
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:48,540
-Play on, I'll come.
-Domi.

566
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,250
Goal!

567
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,830
It's out of the post. It's outside.

568
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,080
-Go.
-Give the ball to me.

569
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:02,330
Gokul.

570
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:04,620
What's this? Give me the ball.

571
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,200
Goal!

572
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:11,460
Out.

573
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,240
What's all this?

574
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,620
What's this?

575
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,630
I say, stop this commotion.

576
00:46:16,790 --> 00:46:20,500
-Stop it!
-Make way. l'll take care of this.

577
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,990
Why should we stop? We'll play right here.

578
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,990
It's a housing colony,
you guys are making a racket.

579
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,130
Hey, Shetty.

580
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,990
You have a problem with everyone.
Let them play.

581
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:32,210
That's right.

582
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,990
These kids play here every day.
No one seems to mind then.

583
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:37,160
Yes, but unlike you
they don't create a ruckus.

584
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,700
And you're playing with such a huge ball.

585
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,960
What if it hits a car?
Let's say, this car.

586
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,420
Gokul.

587
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,290
You can hit my car, no problem.

588
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,380
Right on.

589
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:49,580
If you must play

590
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:51,740
then play cricket, it's the national game.

591
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,450
Why play a foreigner's game?

592
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,580
Oh, I see. So they played cricket
in the Bagwad Gita?

593
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,780
Look, don't drag God into this.

594
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:58,990
God will be dragged.

595
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,910
-Punnu, go play. Get the stumps.
-Come on.

596
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:02,500
-Who are you to stop us?
-Place the stumps.

597
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,660
This is a democracy. We'll play as well.

598
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:05,780
Get the ball.

599
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:07,780
Simon, go back! Go back!

600
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:10,120
Get the ball!

601
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,370
Get side.

602
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:16,490
-Come on, get the ball
-Hey, give me the ball.

603
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,160
Come on. Let's play.

604
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:22,710
-Hey! You!
-Just pass the ball.

605
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:26,030
-Take the ball.
-Hey, the old man chickened out. Yes!

606
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,660
He is gone.

607
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,450
-Hey move!
-Hit the ball

608
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:39,780
Rashid.

609
00:47:44,290 --> 00:47:47,000
you illicit child.

610
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,240
Where are you running, rascals? Come here.

611
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:54,370
Why don't you play now?
I'll teach you all a lesson. You dogs.

612
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:57,030
Where are you running? Come out.

613
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:00,780
<i>Speak up.</i>

614
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,340
You were acting smart, weren't you?

615
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,080
You were bullying everyone.

616
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,030
You'll bully me? Speak up!

617
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:11,170
Show me what...

618
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,740
-Oh god.
-Come on.

619
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,000
-What happened to him?
-Ball.

620
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:21,030
Arjun!

621
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,830
-Arjun!
-He has to stop doing that.

622
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:24,950
That's what I said.

623
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,700
Did you see Gokul's pants?

624
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,740
Even if he washes them for ten days,
he has no chance with the window girl.

625
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,950
Forget all that.
Did the cops get involved?

626
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,540
Who knows?
We just left him in an ambulance.

627
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,380
Listen.

628
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,500
If you bring that old man
next Sunday, count me out.

629
00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:45,700
-All of us.
-Sorry.

630
00:48:45,910 --> 00:48:47,780
-<i>All of us are out.</i>
-Listen, I will call you back.

631
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:50,780
Dad.

632
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:51,910
What are you doing?

633
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,460
-Come
-Home sweet home.

634
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:59,030
Dad!

635
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,450
Dad, wait a minute.

636
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,910
Come on, stop, wait.

637
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,130
Firstly, change your clothes into...

638
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:07,530
-I'll just come.
-Sure.

639
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:09,950
Dad, wait.

640
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,130
I'm going to put the water heater on.
Just sit here, then you may take a bath.

641
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,620
-No water heater.
-No.

642
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,130
-Just sit. Okay, go have a bath.
-Cold water.

643
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:20,130
-No, you can't wear this, Dad.
-I can't wear it?

644
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,990
No, just wear what I am giving you, okay?

645
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:26,660
-Sorry about that.
-That's okay.

646
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:29,580
You'll have something? Tea or coffee?

647
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:32,330
Tea.

648
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,910
Didn't have much luck
with coffee last time.

649
00:49:37,830 --> 00:49:38,660
I'm just coming.

650
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,580
Besides,

651
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:48,290
I don't know,
Dad and I have a special connection.

652
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,250
When I was ten years old,

653
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,710
I had a massive attack of pneumonia.

654
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,130
But Dad? No chance.

655
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,030
I spoke to Raj about you

656
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:34,870
and what is the big deal
about quitting your job?

657
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,660
It's no mystery.

658
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,990
No, I don't know, <i>Swami</i>!

659
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,170
Don't act coy, just come out with it.

660
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,460
Don't interrupt the <i>swami</i>, wretched girl.

661
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,580
<i> And at the security check,</i>

662
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,200
<i>I see Kunal Pandey.</i>

663
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:41,120
<i>Kunal was a senior.</i>

664
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:43,240
<i>I mean he was a legend of sorts</i>.

665
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:44,990
Kunal?

666
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,000
Kunal?

667
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,420
Kunal.

668
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,080
Hi.

669
00:51:57,410 --> 00:51:58,330
Arjun.

670
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:00,420
How are you?

671
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:02,160
Where are you off to?

672
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,620
<i>I don't know why,he was speaking to me in Bengali.</i>

673
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,950
I'm not saying
it would have happened to me.

674
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,030
But it made me think then, you know.

675
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:20,240
Now if I had coffee beans...

676
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,500
It's been ages
since I've felt so relaxed, you know.

677
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,240
All right, I better get going.

678
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:51,670
We'll be playing anyway.

679
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,710
It's one thing
that I really look forward to.

680
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,670
Yes, but it feels so weird,
to push your father on to someone else.

681
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,200
I'll sort it out.

682
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,420
First try me out then think of payment.

683
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,030
College was over.

684
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:44,990
Mom retired and...

685
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,830
If I mentioned anything about the band,
she used to freak out.

686
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,380
She used to get damn irritated.

687
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:49,280
-One song.
-If they complain, I'll blame you.

688
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:50,370
Yes, sure.

689
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:35,880
Working on a Sunday, sir?

690
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,420
If I have work, would I be here?

691
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:44,780
Salim, listen. All I want to say is

692
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:47,910
you have my coat and my pant.
I want it delivered.

693
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,500
Hey, you bums.

694
00:58:49,950 --> 00:58:50,780
Get off.

695
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,170
No, I'll call you back.

696
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:54,490
Yes, I will call you.

697
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:57,500
Can't you get it?
I've been screaming for so long.

698
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:01,740
Don't you get what am I saying?

699
00:59:01,870 --> 00:59:03,330
The next time I'll whack you.

700
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:06,330
-They messed up my motorcycle.
-What happened?

701
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:09,370
I've been yelling for so long,
they just won't listen.

702
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:10,920
They were messing with my motorcycle.

703
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,780
Sorry.

704
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:25,990
Sometimes they don't wear
their hearing aids, so they can't hear.

705
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:28,210
Otherwise they're good boys.

706
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:31,450
Sorry. I had no clue.

707
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,370
How would you know?

708
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:40,170
-If you two want to ride the motorcycle...
-Please, can you speak English?

709
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,420
They won't learn otherwise.

710
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:46,370
Motorcycle, beach...

711
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,950
How does one say sorry?

712
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,200
-That's sorry?
-Yes.

713
01:00:04,040 --> 01:00:06,090
You were pulling my leg, right?

714
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:07,500
Sorry.

715
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:09,330
What did I say?

716
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:12,170
I am a fool.

717
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:13,450
Is that right?

718
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:17,080
You had a good laugh? Yes? And you too?

719
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,120
They know, I'm just kidding.

720
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:21,120
-Go on, play with the motorcycle.
-Sorry.

721
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,630
-Where's their father?
-He's in Dubai.

722
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:34,780
I see.

723
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:37,240
With his second wife.

724
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:40,410
We had two deaf kids,

725
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,130
so it's my mistake.

726
01:00:45,450 --> 01:00:46,280
Sorry.

727
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:49,870
It's okay. It's life.

728
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:58,030
-See you then. Good bye.
-Bye.

729
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,370
Are we doing all this
just to catch one rat?

730
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,540
I'm going to get it.

731
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:12,410
Maybe you should clean your room.

732
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:16,750
Never mind.

733
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,700
but wouldn't it be better
if you got the room cleaned?

734
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:25,200
See you.

735
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:29,370
<i>You fool.</i>

736
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:31,030
I told you I had a meeting
with German clients

737
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:33,240
You still had to shag inside the bathroom
for last two hours?

738
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:34,450
So get up early, you fool.

739
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:36,170
What do you mean get up early?
I went inside.

740
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:38,960
Your girlfriend had to go for shopping
so you locked yourself in the bathroom.

741
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,500
Domi, he has finished his bath.
Now you can go.

742
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:45,200
No, Mom. I had gone inside,
he pushed me aside and barged in.

743
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:48,040
Yes, you slow coach. Always a slow coach.

744
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:50,080
-That's your problem.
-Just keep quiet. Don't...

745
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,120
Don't mess with me right now.
I'll slap you.

746
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,160
-Really?
-I will slap you.

747
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:55,750
And you think I won't do anything?

748
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:00,780
-My ukulele, put my ukulele down.
-Your ukulele?

749
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,880
Oh, this is your ukulele, right?

750
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,080
-Come on.
-Bring it on.

751
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,490
Why do you worry so much?

752
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,450
You two are adults now
yet you are bickering like children!

753
01:02:46,910 --> 01:02:47,780
Mom!

754
01:02:50,330 --> 01:02:51,330
Asshole.

755
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,080
Yes, great <i>swami</i>.

756
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,210
So, what's the plan for today?

757
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,740
Bye, Dad.

758
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,700
So, Mr. Ranganathan,

759
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,780
you and me in this wonderful world.

760
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:51,660
Let's see.

761
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:45,080
Cut!

762
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:46,740
Who are they? Where did they come from?

763
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:49,030
Move. Where did they come from?

764
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,280
Move.

765
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:55,920
Come on, man.

766
01:05:56,450 --> 01:05:58,160
-Let's do something.
-Do what?

767
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,160
Can't we find one place to play,
in all of Mumbai?

768
01:06:01,330 --> 01:06:03,660
Mumbai is completely packed.
Where do we play?

769
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,380
Mumbai has enough space for weddings,

770
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,290
political rallies,

771
01:06:08,450 --> 01:06:10,450
or Gods and religious celebrations...

772
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,160
There's space for high-rise towers too.

773
01:06:13,330 --> 01:06:14,450
There's no place to crap.

774
01:06:15,370 --> 01:06:16,870
We can just shit anywhere.

775
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:18,910
Well, this is India.

776
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,340
That's how we get Oscars.

777
01:06:20,540 --> 01:06:23,290
We'll get one for the sequel too.
<i>Slumdog part two bum dogs.</i>

778
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,780
Forget Mumbai.

779
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,160
Let's move to somewhere else.

780
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,080
Where?

781
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,370
The whole country is becoming
one big Mumbai.

782
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:37,750
Domi, what the hell are you doing?
How much are you hogging?

783
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,240
You know its outcome, don't you?

784
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:41,950
You know, my brother

785
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,740
sleeps right next to me.

786
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:47,490
I'll fart in his face, all night.

787
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:51,080
Dude, repeat my drink.

788
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:54,030
Can you play that song, "Chilmanâ€?

789
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,370
No boss, it's closing time.

790
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:56,370
Dude, play the song.

791
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:59,420
-Play it. Come on.
-Just half a song, all right?

792
01:06:59,660 --> 01:07:01,530
Come on, just play it. What are you doing?

793
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:04,030
-Jayesh, you sing.
-You have heard?

794
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,830
-It's great, sing Jayesh.
-You know it too.

795
01:07:06,830 --> 01:07:09,780
-Just once.
-Some Hindi songs use weird words, right?

796
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,290
-<i>â€œChillmun"</i>!
-What does <i>â€œChilmunâ€</i> mean?

797
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,160
Chill man!

798
01:07:17,830 --> 01:07:19,280
Oil and Natural Gas Corporation.

799
01:07:24,330 --> 01:07:25,160
Inhale.

800
01:07:25,450 --> 01:07:26,830
Take deep breaths.

801
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:31,450
Bastard Arjun.

802
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,920
Are you not feeling bad
that we're not playing?

803
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:35,540
Normally you'd be the first to cry.

804
01:07:36,790 --> 01:07:39,340
-I am.
-What will we do every Sunday now?

805
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:41,530
Let's go to Goa.

806
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,370
At least we'll get a place to play.

807
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:45,990
It's set.

808
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:47,030
Let's hire a bus.

809
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:50,420
That owner of Santosh Travel,
who lives next to me?

810
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:52,840
-Yes I know.
-He looks up to me. He'll give a discount.

811
01:07:52,950 --> 01:07:55,240
Two days to travel
and one day for playing. It's set.

812
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:56,620
-Good idea.
-That's very desperate.

813
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,700
-Goa.
-I agree.

814
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,120
Does anyone have a cigarette?

815
01:07:59,250 --> 01:08:01,090
Arjun, why are you
being a dick about this?

816
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,740
Arjun's a nice guy!

817
01:08:08,160 --> 01:08:09,780
Domi, your phone is ringing.

818
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:15,530
Bloody client.

819
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:17,200
It's your client, answer it.

820
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:21,200
Disgusting horny bugger.

821
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:23,410
All day he's been calling me.

822
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,780
He wants me to arrange girls for him.

823
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,410
Then give him Rashid's number.

824
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:29,960
Hey, Bawa, careful now.

825
01:08:30,500 --> 01:08:31,920
I'm not a pimp, all right?

826
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,960
What are you good at besides womanizing?

827
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:35,340
Does that make you jealous?

828
01:08:36,290 --> 01:08:38,090
If you're so desperate,
give your Peppy some...

829
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:39,490
Bastard, don't talk about her, okay?

830
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,410
-Chill, guys.
-Why shouldn't I?

831
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,000
-Why shouldn't I? Tell me.
-Buddy...

832
01:08:43,080 --> 01:08:45,280
-Your mother...
-Are you mad?

833
01:08:45,370 --> 01:08:47,160
Let him finish. My mother is...

834
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:49,200
And what has your mother got? A bus depot?

835
01:08:49,290 --> 01:08:50,210
Shut the hell up!

836
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:52,590
-Chill, Rashid. What's with you?
-Are you crazy?

837
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:53,630
He can't talk any shit.

838
01:08:53,700 --> 01:08:54,870
Doesn't mean you can hit him.

839
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:55,950
Relax! Relax!

840
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:57,420
-Bawa, come....
-Keep your mouth shut.

841
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,000
Bawa, have your drink. Come on.

842
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:01,590
Don't look like that, have your drink.
Intense look.

843
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,950
-What?
-Bus depot.

844
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,740
How can a mother have a bus depot?

845
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,530
Mom has a bus depot, what are you...

846
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,130
Rashid, why so angry?

847
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,530
-Don't take it personally.
-He can't just talk any rubbish.

848
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,120
Let it go.

849
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:26,790
-Are we okay?
-Yes.

850
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:28,750
Okay, I'll tell you what...

851
01:09:28,830 --> 01:09:30,870
It's not like I'm not serious, all right?

852
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,870
I was in love, in college.

853
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:36,090
Her father was a politician.

854
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:39,090
She was paranoid,
her father would kill her.

855
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:43,280
You remember, right?

856
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:46,410
I wrote a long letter to my dad.

857
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:48,250
Ten pages long, Jayesh.

858
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:53,580
I wrote, how much I loved her

859
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:56,830
and if both of us could get
a visa to Dubai,

860
01:09:57,620 --> 01:09:59,580
I would turn my life around.

861
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:03,830
Her father called me to his office.

862
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,500
He made me sit

863
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,160
and held a gun right here.

864
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:16,130
And then he said,

865
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:20,420
he'd rather keep his daughter a spinster,
than see her married to a Muslim.

866
01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:29,410
She left for America.

867
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:32,410
Married a white guy.

868
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,130
And he's okay with a white guy?

869
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,330
Back then I wanted to
do something in life.

870
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,340
Damn it!

871
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:45,090
But who gives a damn?

872
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,620
People only care
about what's on the outside.

873
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:53,040
Your brand of clothes,
your shoes, your hair...

874
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:00,370
All these girls I go out with...

875
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:03,160
What do you think will happen

876
01:11:03,290 --> 01:11:05,790
if I ask any of the girls to marry me?

877
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:08,950
Will anyone agree? You tell me.

878
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:10,950
Tell me.

879
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:13,920
What will their parents say?

880
01:11:14,120 --> 01:11:15,620
Praise Lord Krishna.

881
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:18,240
Yes, right.

882
01:11:19,870 --> 01:11:21,700
Peppy is not some tramp, okay?

883
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:24,840
So Bawa, all my flings
are also decent, get it?

884
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:34,160
Actually, Shyamak's mother
has a bus depot.

885
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,090
No, I bet it's an airport.

886
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:41,240
Mehernosh, this thing with your boss,
just suck it up.

887
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:42,830
Better still...

888
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:44,700
Spit it out.

889
01:11:46,660 --> 01:11:48,160
I just remembered that song.

890
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,530
Then sing it, I've been waiting to hear.

891
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:52,410
Which one? Yes, I want to hear.
Have not heard it.

892
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:53,700
It's a great song.

893
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:20,630
Jayesh, what happened?

894
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,170
-What happened?
-What happened?

895
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:27,340
Up there... Isn't there anyone up there?

896
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:28,700
-What's the matter?
-What?

897
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:30,540
Is there no one in heaven?

898
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:33,660
There is no God.

899
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:41,530
Why can't He bear to see us happy?

900
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:43,750
-Jayesh, let it go.
-Let it go.

901
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:46,660
Take it easy, Jayesh.

902
01:12:49,290 --> 01:12:50,380
Jayesh.

903
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:54,240
No.

904
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,130
-I'll get them!
-Jayesh!

905
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:58,630
-Jayesh, what are you doing?
-Have you gone mad?

906
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:00,200
I'll get each and every one of them.

907
01:13:00,290 --> 01:13:03,380
-Give me the number of that girl's father.
-It's an old story, forget it.

908
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:04,700
The number of your boss.

909
01:13:04,790 --> 01:13:06,090
Your client's number.

910
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:07,490
He wants women, right?

911
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:10,500
I won't spare anyone. I won't.

912
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:13,380
-It's okay, he'll calm down.
-Calm down.

913
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:14,620
How do we take him home?

914
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:16,460
We can take him to my place.

915
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:18,500
But how do we take him there?

916
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:19,450
Hold his feet.

917
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:22,370
Okay.

918
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,950
Look here, Jayesh, quiet. Be quiet.

919
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:26,830
Jayesh, stop it.

920
01:13:28,830 --> 01:13:30,240
Jayesh, keep quiet.

921
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:40,410
Normally, he's so tired.
He didn't play today?

922
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:43,130
Yes, today he rested quite a bit actually.

923
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,130
Oh! Nothing to worry about, right?
I mean he's okay?

924
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:49,790
Yes nothing to worry about.

925
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,950
Today there were quite a few players
so he had to rest.

926
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:55,580
So you guys are playing next Sunday?

927
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:56,780
<i>Of course.</i>

928
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,710
Okay cool, I'll come.

929
01:13:59,290 --> 01:14:01,210
Next week, we're not in town.

930
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,660
But you just said you're playing.

931
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:06,840
Yes we're playing,
but we're playing in Goa.

932
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:12,120
Domi has a house there.
So we go there every year to play once.

933
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:16,240
Oh so then I... I can't send dad.

934
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,130
Hang on one second.

935
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:25,950
What?

936
01:14:26,620 --> 01:14:28,990
What? I have to make a call.

937
01:14:30,450 --> 01:14:31,450
Use your cell phone.

938
01:14:31,660 --> 01:14:33,160
You use your cell phone.

939
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:34,950
My house, my phone.

940
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:37,450
Listen, my...

941
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:42,630
Listen, I'll call you back in a bit.

942
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,040
Yes.

943
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:46,740
Good old oil massage.

944
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,120
Shipu.

945
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:51,700
Ask your uncle

946
01:16:52,330 --> 01:16:54,830
who does he talk to on the phone at night.

947
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:57,200
Uncle, who do you talk to on the phone?

948
01:16:57,790 --> 01:16:59,040
Nobody.

949
01:16:59,370 --> 01:17:00,660
Nobody.

950
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,910
Does your uncle have a girlfriend?

951
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:06,370
Uncle, do you have a girlfriend?

952
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:07,590
No girlfriend.

953
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,210
Oh look.

954
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:13,410
Nobody is calling your uncle in the night.

955
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,210
-It's nobody.
-Shu.

956
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:18,590
-Nobody is calling him.
-Shu!

957
01:17:20,410 --> 01:17:21,330
Just one second...

958
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:23,120
Yes, tell me.

959
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,130
Yes, I was just thinking...

960
01:17:25,950 --> 01:17:27,030
I'll also come to Goa.

961
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:31,040
I mean with Dad, of course,
if that's okay.

962
01:17:31,370 --> 01:17:32,240
Yes, sure.

963
01:17:34,330 --> 01:17:36,330
But will you manage?

964
01:17:36,830 --> 01:17:38,740
<i>I mean, don't hassle yourself.</i>

965
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:41,870
If you don't want us to come then...

966
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:43,700
No.

967
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:45,370
I meant your work.

968
01:17:45,910 --> 01:17:47,080
No, that I'll manage.

969
01:17:48,870 --> 01:17:49,990
Cool then.

970
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:52,780
Okay, bye.

971
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,380
Bye.

972
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:07,870
Goa?

973
01:18:08,330 --> 01:18:09,240
What rubbish!

974
01:18:09,830 --> 01:18:10,740
Hey, joker.

975
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:11,740
What are you thinking man?

976
01:18:12,290 --> 01:18:13,170
Hey, joker.

977
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,460
I was just high when I said it.

978
01:18:15,750 --> 01:18:17,710
No, seriously, just listen to me,
just two days.

979
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:20,000
-Saturday, August 15th, okay?
-<i>Hey, joker!</i>

980
01:18:20,080 --> 01:18:22,450
-So, we leave on... Where are you?
-<i>Joker!</i>

981
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:23,590
-At a birthday party.
-Joker.

982
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:26,420
-Bloody actor didn't show up.
-Joker.

983
01:18:26,950 --> 01:18:28,030
Hey, joker.

984
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:29,030
Shut up!

985
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:38,380
-You were saying...
-Okay anyway, forget it.

986
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:40,080
Monday is also a holiday.

987
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:42,120
We leave Friday evening,
stay there Saturday and Sunday

988
01:18:42,200 --> 01:18:43,740
and come back on Monday. What do you say?

989
01:18:43,830 --> 01:18:45,620
No, I don't think I can.

990
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:56,910
Fine, let's go.

991
01:18:59,250 --> 01:19:00,540
I'll convince my mom.

992
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:02,950
But what about the others?

993
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:11,030
Yes, tell me.

994
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:12,990
Sir, does anyone live here?

995
01:19:13,410 --> 01:19:14,950
I live here. Tell me.

996
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:16,630
How many rats are there?

997
01:19:17,870 --> 01:19:19,280
I've seen only one.

998
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,490
No, sir, there could be more.

999
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:24,200
Maybe you saw a different rat each time.

1000
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:26,200
Whatever, man! Tell me its solution.

1001
01:19:26,620 --> 01:19:30,120
Sir, in such cases
we recommend a full service.

1002
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:33,700
This includes fumigation,
spray, the complete works.

1003
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:36,280
There won't be a thing
left alive in your home.

1004
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:38,170
That's great. Go for it.

1005
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,710
-Sure, sir?
-Yes.

1006
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,170
The only thing is

1007
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:44,380
you'll have to keep your house closed
for a few days. No one can live here.

1008
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:45,780
Oh, no.

1009
01:19:50,700 --> 01:19:51,660
So, should I go ahead?

1010
01:19:53,200 --> 01:19:54,080
Hello.

1011
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:26,330
I'll spit it out.

1012
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:30,580
Hey, are you crazy? Come on.

1013
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:45,710
Have you gone mad? Don't spit.

1014
01:24:07,790 --> 01:24:10,130
You'll never work anywhere else again.

1015
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,370
Goa? Goa!

1016
01:24:18,660 --> 01:24:20,120
Bloody...

1017
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:21,710
Couldn't you give me a heads up?

1018
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,840
We are booked for a holy pilgrimage.

1019
01:24:25,450 --> 01:24:27,700
Yes, everyone wants the blessings
of the Mother Goddess.

1020
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:29,370
You guys have a ball.

1021
01:24:29,450 --> 01:24:31,410
While I look forward to all the...

1022
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:32,990
blessings!

1023
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,920
-Hi!
-Hurry up! Come on, we have to go.

1024
01:24:47,410 --> 01:24:48,280
Hi.

1025
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:49,830
How are you, child?

1026
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:51,780
-Hi.
-Hi.

1027
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:53,090
How are you?

1028
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:54,750
Let me have a look.

1029
01:24:55,910 --> 01:24:58,080
Still shining, still handsome.

1030
01:24:58,620 --> 01:24:59,780
Really...

1031
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:01,130
Rashid.

1032
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,170
Come here for a second.

1033
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:03,240
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

1034
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:09,700
Guys, just bear in mind,
we're playing every Sunday, okay?

1035
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,620
The old man again?

1036
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:16,910
Okay, Rashid, just listen.

1037
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:18,920
Who's the girl with the old man?

1038
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:20,170
That's his daughter.

1039
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,630
There. Now the cat is out of the bag.

1040
01:25:21,870 --> 01:25:22,740
No cat, man.

1041
01:25:22,830 --> 01:25:25,280
Just that I take him out on Sundays
on the pretext of playing soccer.

1042
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,030
Bastard Arjun, you are a traitor.

1043
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:28,120
Will you keep quiet?

1044
01:25:28,250 --> 01:25:30,000
-Do you have hots for this girl?
-Are you crazy?

1045
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,580
-Then screw it!
-What the hell, man?

1046
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:33,700
Arjun, come clean.
Do you have the hots for her?

1047
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:34,960
What is this language anyway?

1048
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,670
-Be honest.
-Okay, I'm interested in her.

1049
01:25:37,120 --> 01:25:37,990
-Hi.
-Hi.

1050
01:25:38,450 --> 01:25:39,330
Come, let's go.

1051
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:44,990
That's Vinta.

1052
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:47,620
-Hi.
-That's Dennis, Domi's brother.

1053
01:25:47,830 --> 01:25:49,700
-She's Shipra, my niece.
-Hello!

1054
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,960
-Domi, that's Mehernosh.
-Hi.

1055
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:53,380
-Hello.
-And that's Rashid.

1056
01:25:53,450 --> 01:25:54,740
And this is Mr. Ranganathan!

1057
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:58,200
I just wanted to thank you all
for bearing with dad every Sunday.

1058
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:00,580
Anytime. Mr. Ranganathan.

1059
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,240
Let's go.

1060
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:06,660
Are you sure? Can I take something?

1061
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:07,630
No, that's okay.

1062
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:08,830
He is taking them.

1063
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,700
Yay! Goa!

1064
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:14,490
Do wait after the first toll in Pune.
I am starving.

1065
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:20,330
So you were in college with Arjun?

1066
01:26:20,580 --> 01:26:21,830
Which college did you go to?

1067
01:26:21,950 --> 01:26:23,580
I was in Sophia.

1068
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:25,240
Why? Why?

1069
01:26:25,620 --> 01:26:26,830
That was Rashid's hangout place.

1070
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,500
-You had a girlfriend there?
-No, not girlfriend...

1071
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:30,700
Girlfriends.

1072
01:26:31,410 --> 01:26:32,620
Don't ruin my reputation, man.

1073
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:34,530
Rashid wasn't in our college.

1074
01:26:35,250 --> 01:26:37,040
Yes, I was in Bhavan's.

1075
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,280
I used to come to Jai Hind

1076
01:26:39,660 --> 01:26:42,030
for one or two...

1077
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:43,460
Twelve?

1078
01:26:43,540 --> 01:26:45,000
-Or 14, was it?
-What rubbish!

1079
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,330
-But he's a terrific singer.
-Really?

1080
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:50,240
So once we heard him, we decided,
Rashid's not leaving our college.

1081
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:53,090
Come on then, sing something for us.

1082
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:54,660
It's no big deal.

1083
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:56,950
-He is lying.
-Come on, Rashid brother. Sing for us.

1084
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,370
Dude, she called me her brother.

1085
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,830
-There goes my chance.
-Okay.

1086
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:02,990
Respected, Mr. Rashid, please sing.

1087
01:27:04,040 --> 01:27:05,460
All right, we'll dance for you, okay?

1088
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:07,080
Come on now, or I'll give you a whack.

1089
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:08,910
Now that's a serious threat.

1090
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,500
Domi, out with it!

1091
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:15,200
-I want everyone to applaud. Okay?
-Sure.

1092
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:17,700
And no one joins in until I say so.

1093
01:27:18,950 --> 01:27:20,660
And if you don't sing well,
you will get a whack!

1094
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,960
-Come on, sit down.
-Come.

1095
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:26,830
Did you wash your guitar that it shrunk?

1096
01:27:29,120 --> 01:27:30,950
Which song?

1097
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:31,880
Your favorite.

1098
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:34,160
-"My Heart"?
-"My Heart."

1099
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,660
Have you tuned it?

1100
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:42,830
-Come on.
-Yes, whatever!

1101
01:27:59,830 --> 01:28:04,240
<i>My heart, is a fool</i>

1102
01:28:05,830 --> 01:28:10,620
<i>It rushes, without a thought</i>

1103
01:28:11,910 --> 01:28:16,580
<i>My heart, is a fool</i>

1104
01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:23,170
<i>It rushes, without a thought</i>

1105
01:28:24,290 --> 01:28:30,000
<i>Can't tell if it's coming or goingIt lives in its own world</i>

1106
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:34,910
<i>Oh, foolish heart, be still for once</i>

1107
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:37,330
<i>My heart</i>

1108
01:30:14,620 --> 01:30:18,030
Jayesh!

1109
01:30:24,950 --> 01:30:26,740
I told them, the stock market crashed.

1110
01:30:26,830 --> 01:30:28,490
And took the first flight to Goa.

1111
01:30:28,790 --> 01:30:30,500
-Very good.
-Good job.

1112
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,120
Hey Jayesh, how are you?

1113
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:36,880
Where have you been lately?

1114
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:55,920
What's up?

1115
01:31:14,160 --> 01:31:16,200
<i>Yes, housie will start now in sometime.</i>

1116
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:19,500
<i>We are waiting for Ram Naikand the crowd...</i>

1117
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:53,660
In the movies they show the hero
and heroine by the beach just like this.

1118
01:32:57,540 --> 01:33:00,170
It always makes me think
especially by the beach in Mumbai

1119
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,210
that what is the big deal?

1120
01:33:11,330 --> 01:33:13,580
There's no space
to enjoy the little things.

1121
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,090
No seclusion.

1122
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:17,280
It's so open out here.

1123
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:20,210
You can enjoy each and every moment.

1124
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,540
When you get some space
everything feels great, right?

1125
01:33:27,950 --> 01:33:29,410
It's the same with people too.

1126
01:33:35,410 --> 01:33:36,660
You know what I do?

1127
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:40,590
There's this building in my area.

1128
01:33:40,700 --> 01:33:42,620
Belvedere Heights,
it's the tallest building.

1129
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,250
I go there
and perch high on the water tank.

1130
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,330
From that height,

1131
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,950
the world seems so far away,
it's an amazing feeling.

1132
01:33:53,450 --> 01:33:55,120
Do you just sneak into any building?

1133
01:33:55,250 --> 01:33:57,170
-Yes.
-Really?

1134
01:33:57,830 --> 01:34:00,530
No, I mean they do
have security guards there. But...

1135
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:04,830
Actually, I know this friend of mine.
Her father stays there.

1136
01:34:04,910 --> 01:34:07,240
So whenever I go,
I just rattle off his name.

1137
01:34:07,330 --> 01:34:08,200
U.R. Gandh.

1138
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:09,830
What?

1139
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,240
U.R. Gandh.

1140
01:34:11,370 --> 01:34:12,410
No, you are stinky.

1141
01:34:13,950 --> 01:34:15,870
No, you are stinky.

1142
01:34:20,410 --> 01:34:23,280
I guess, movies are inspired
by real life, right?

1143
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:27,030
You believe everything
you see in the movies?

1144
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:29,200
Not everything.

1145
01:34:30,250 --> 01:34:31,380
Love, romance?

1146
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:33,920
Yes.

1147
01:34:34,330 --> 01:34:35,280
"Yes."

1148
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:39,490
Why do men act so macho
when talking about romance?

1149
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:45,000
but there's life after that.

1150
01:34:45,290 --> 01:34:46,540
Movies don't cover that.

1151
01:34:46,620 --> 01:34:47,950
You overthink everything.

1152
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:50,090
Did you ever have a girlfriend?

1153
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:51,630
It's not that.

1154
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:52,840
There was one time when...

1155
01:34:52,910 --> 01:34:53,830
Oh, God!

1156
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,160
Why do you take everything so seriously?

1157
01:34:56,450 --> 01:34:58,530
Give a straightforward answer.
Did you have a girlfriend?

1158
01:34:58,950 --> 01:35:00,620
"Yes, I had a good time
and then dumped her."

1159
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:02,990
-No, I didn't.
-Just kidding.

1160
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,240
Did you not want to say anything else?

1161
01:35:57,620 --> 01:35:58,990
What did you want me to say?

1162
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,030
I thought you were in the mood to talk.

1163
01:36:01,950 --> 01:36:03,370
Sure, we can talk.

1164
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:05,410
No, it's okay. Enough talking for today.

1165
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:19,710
Where were you?

1166
01:36:19,790 --> 01:36:20,710
Somewhere.

1167
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:22,450
Yes, please.

1168
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:30,370
Come on, man. Come, get up.

1169
01:36:30,450 --> 01:36:32,370
What are you doing? You carry on.
I don't want to.

1170
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:34,580
Look, selfie.

1171
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:36,780
You carry on.

1172
01:38:03,870 --> 01:38:06,120
-How are you feeling this morning?
-Great!

1173
01:38:06,370 --> 01:38:07,740
-Really?
-Yes.

1174
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,590
It's strange that you are awake
after all the drinking you did last night.

1175
01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:12,700
I wish I wasn't.

1176
01:38:12,830 --> 01:38:14,160
Shipu, have one sip.

1177
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:17,030
Otherwise, how will you go potty, baby?

1178
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:18,120
-Have one sip.
-No.

1179
01:38:18,410 --> 01:38:19,780
-Just a little.
-No.

1180
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:35,960
How did I get to my room?
I don't remember at all.

1181
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,880
Just this morning,
I remembered I have a daughter.

1182
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:54,130
-Just a little sip.
-No.

1183
01:39:00,330 --> 01:39:01,780
You got ready pretty early.

1184
01:39:02,450 --> 01:39:03,410
Yes.

1185
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:19,910
No, I better start packing.

1186
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:22,080
Is there any tea?

1187
01:39:22,410 --> 01:39:24,700
In the kitchen.
You'll have to just heat it.

1188
01:39:34,410 --> 01:39:36,280
Come on, let's play.

1189
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:39,950
Gautam Buddha.

1190
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:41,530
What happened?

1191
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:43,460
Who died?

1192
01:39:43,950 --> 01:39:45,580
Come, let's play one last game. Get up.

1193
01:39:45,660 --> 01:39:46,660
Let's go.

1194
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:49,460
What's the point?

1195
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:52,590
Don't be a wet blanket, come on.

1196
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:53,910
How will it help?

1197
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:55,710
How long can you play anyway?

1198
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:59,590
-It won't change your life, right?
-Don't annoy me in the morning.

1199
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,790
I said, leave me alone.

1200
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:04,330
Guys, let's leave him behind.

1201
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:05,410
Yes, leave me.

1202
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:07,250
What else can you do?

1203
01:40:08,750 --> 01:40:10,130
Are you all right?

1204
01:40:11,500 --> 01:40:12,880
I hope you are not sick.

1205
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:14,080
Lay off, man. Don't touch.

1206
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:15,990
Mehernosh.

1207
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:19,500
Go to hell!

1208
01:40:19,950 --> 01:40:21,120
Up yours bloody.

1209
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,530
Hey, don't use bad words.

1210
01:40:22,620 --> 01:40:23,780
Mehernosh, relax, what happened?

1211
01:40:24,540 --> 01:40:27,420
Look, if you don't want to play
then don't.

1212
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:29,620
Yes, right!
â€œIf you don't want to play then don't.

1213
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,340
If you can't do it, let it go."

1214
01:40:31,540 --> 01:40:32,500
Run away then.

1215
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:34,960
Bloody, what... Escapists United we are.

1216
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:37,700
Hey.

1217
01:40:37,950 --> 01:40:39,410
I told you not to use bad words.

1218
01:40:39,500 --> 01:40:41,460
-Mehernosh, who's running away?
-You shouldn't speak.

1219
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:43,210
-Hey.
-Has everyone finished packing?

1220
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:44,700
I'm not running anywhere.

1221
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:46,660
I just can't. I have no stamina.

1222
01:40:46,750 --> 01:40:50,210
You have the stamina to leave your family
and come to Juhu Beach every Sunday?

1223
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:52,910
-What did he say? You mother...
-Let it go.

1224
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,880
-What is wrong with you guys?
-Yes, I have lost it.

1225
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:56,330
And you have it figured, right?

1226
01:40:56,540 --> 01:40:57,540
Stop chasing girls then.

1227
01:40:57,790 --> 01:40:59,630
-I've done a lot for my family.
-Do something useful.

1228
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:00,990
Enough, enough.

1229
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,530
Don't create ruckus. Just keep quiet.

1230
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,990
-Come.
-I needed some stress relief.

1231
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:05,740
Are you afraid that your mom will hear us?

1232
01:41:07,540 --> 01:41:08,380
Don't start with me.

1233
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:10,670
-Don't start. Yes.
-You'll complain to your mom?

1234
01:41:10,750 --> 01:41:13,250
-You'll go crying to mom?
-You are really pissing me off.

1235
01:41:13,330 --> 01:41:14,490
What? Move away!

1236
01:41:14,870 --> 01:41:16,830
Why do you drag my mama?
What is wrong with you?

1237
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:23,580
And you don't try to convince me.

1238
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:25,090
You are their leader.

1239
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:26,660
I admit, I am. Now just try to relax.

1240
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:27,630
Get lost!

1241
01:41:27,700 --> 01:41:28,870
Hey, Bawa! What are you doing?

1242
01:41:29,080 --> 01:41:30,330
You chickened out of a job.

1243
01:41:30,830 --> 01:41:32,660
You met a nice girl
and again you chickened out.

1244
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,410
You are the biggest escapist.

1245
01:41:35,950 --> 01:41:37,580
You are getting too personal,
I'm warning you.

1246
01:41:37,660 --> 01:41:39,910
-Now what are you doing?
-Why are you starting now?

1247
01:41:40,040 --> 01:41:41,000
-You want to hit me?
-Why?

1248
01:41:41,080 --> 01:41:43,620
Hit me! Come on!

1249
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:44,990
Hit me!

1250
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:46,920
Hit me, come on!

1251
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:49,410
Here.

1252
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:50,700
-Here.
-Hey, Bawa.

1253
01:41:50,790 --> 01:41:51,670
-Stop it!
-Bawa!

1254
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,200
-Are you okay? Mehernosh?
-Bawa, control.

1255
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:56,120
Are you okay?

1256
01:41:58,830 --> 01:41:59,740
All of you...

1257
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,160
Bloody hell, there isn't any place for us.

1258
01:42:07,500 --> 01:42:08,420
We're pushed around.

1259
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:10,840
And we're okay with that?

1260
01:42:15,290 --> 01:42:16,290
Why don't we fight back?

1261
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:20,030
Bloody...

1262
01:42:20,910 --> 01:42:22,030
We give up so easily.

1263
01:42:24,410 --> 01:42:25,330
So what do we do?

1264
01:42:27,040 --> 01:42:28,090
We sit on the sidelines

1265
01:42:28,540 --> 01:42:29,500
and laugh at the world.

1266
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,040
â€œLook at this idiot.

1267
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,460
Look at that idiot."

1268
01:42:40,620 --> 01:42:41,530
So what does that make us?

1269
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:46,620
We give up so easily.

1270
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:00,200
Shouldn't we?

1271
01:43:03,120 --> 01:43:04,030
We are just spectators.

1272
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:30,250
-You're so weird.
-Bawa!

1273
01:43:30,620 --> 01:43:32,240
Come on, get up!

1274
01:43:33,950 --> 01:43:35,780
-Are you hurt?
-Did you knockdown a few?

1275
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:36,840
Sorry, guys.

1276
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,420
You have a scratch.

1277
01:43:38,580 --> 01:43:40,240
You hit yourself and apologize to us.

1278
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:41,870
Arjun, what are you doing?

1279
01:43:41,950 --> 01:43:44,830
-There's dirt. Everyone, lend a hand.
-Stop.

1280
01:43:44,910 --> 01:43:46,740
-What are you doing?
-There's dirt.

1281
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:47,450
Kavi.

1282
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:18,240
-I'll manage.
-I'll just give a hand.

1283
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:55,080
Kavi.

1284
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,500
I want to say something.

1285
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:27,120
But I haven't even said...

1286
01:49:45,290 --> 01:49:47,840
But when you are around,
they behave like good brothers.

1287
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:50,000
Just the way
they should have been, always.

1288
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:02,160
That's insignificant, believe me.

1289
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:07,880
You are such a good soul, Vinta.

1290
01:50:09,790 --> 01:50:11,130
You have a positive influence on them.

1291
01:50:16,370 --> 01:50:17,370
I'm going to Goa.

1292
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:19,030
Don't stop me now, Domi.

1293
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:20,920
I am not stopping you.

1294
01:50:24,620 --> 01:50:25,950
I've come to take your bags.

1295
01:50:28,700 --> 01:50:29,580
Didn't I tell you?

1296
01:50:29,910 --> 01:50:32,410
I'm so tired of these two monsters.

1297
01:50:42,830 --> 01:50:44,330
How can you go to Goa?

1298
01:50:45,620 --> 01:50:46,700
I'm not married yet.

1299
01:50:47,370 --> 01:50:48,330
Come on, Domi.

1300
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:53,490
Dennis, you don't have to look
for a new place to stay.

1301
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:54,870
Don't say anything.

1302
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:14,580
With her?

1303
01:51:21,200 --> 01:51:22,580
But it won't be the same, Mom.

1304
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:24,870
Oh, Domi.

1305
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:36,740
Not boorish.

1306
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:00,250
-Who is it?
-It's me.

1307
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:02,750
Hello.

1308
01:54:03,120 --> 01:54:04,580
Oh, hello. Please come in.

1309
01:54:05,160 --> 01:54:05,990
I have these shoes on.

1310
01:54:06,410 --> 01:54:07,620
Doesn't matter, come in.

1311
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:09,540
Keep your shoes on.

1312
01:54:10,250 --> 01:54:12,250
Sorry, everything's a mess.

1313
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:13,990
No, that's okay.

1314
01:54:14,450 --> 01:54:16,950
I found some stuff from college,

1315
01:54:17,330 --> 01:54:19,490
so I thought these little devils
could make use of it.

1316
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:20,960
Would you like to play?

1317
01:54:21,660 --> 01:54:24,240
-Badminton, table tennis...
-You don't have to do this.

1318
01:54:24,330 --> 01:54:25,450
and who wants the soccer?

1319
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:27,120
You want to play?

1320
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:39,410
Tea?

1321
01:54:39,500 --> 01:54:40,340
No.

1322
01:54:40,410 --> 01:54:41,620
I've left the main door open.

1323
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,380
How about something cold to drink?

1324
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:44,780
No, it's all right. Thank you.

1325
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:53,960
You devils.

1326
01:54:59,160 --> 01:55:00,080
See?

1327
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:01,710
Uncle plays well, right?

1328
01:55:02,620 --> 01:55:03,780
You want to learn to play?

1329
01:55:06,950 --> 01:55:08,830
You want to fight... I mean, play?

1330
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:11,200
Do you want to learn and play

1331
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,960
with him?

1332
01:55:13,580 --> 01:55:14,580
They'll play.

1333
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:15,530
Really?

1334
01:55:16,160 --> 01:55:17,160
Here.

1335
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:22,130
I should get going.

1336
01:55:54,830 --> 01:55:55,870
What is it?

1337
01:55:56,120 --> 01:55:57,740
This has come for you.

1338
01:55:58,910 --> 01:56:00,080
-From who?
-How should I know?

1339
01:56:10,910 --> 01:56:12,910
Shanti, get the broom please.

1340
01:56:13,200 --> 01:56:14,580
There's a card here.

1341
01:56:16,410 --> 01:56:18,410
"U.R..."

1342
01:56:18,950 --> 01:56:20,120
Gandh. Gandh.

1343
01:56:22,580 --> 01:56:23,990
U.R. GANDH

1344
01:57:20,450 --> 01:57:22,780
when to propose a girl and when not to.

1345
01:57:23,540 --> 01:57:27,340
Late evening in Goa, by the beach.
Amazing. Perfect.

1346
01:57:28,450 --> 01:57:29,950
At two in the night

1347
01:57:30,330 --> 01:57:32,080
by the gate, in front of the watchman...

1348
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:33,830
Not happening.

1349
01:57:39,790 --> 01:57:42,840
And that's not something
a girl wants to hear either.

1350
01:57:52,790 --> 01:57:54,790
Even if you ask me
to jump from here, I'll oblige.

1351
01:57:55,370 --> 01:57:58,030
Okay, great <i>swami</i>,
melodrama doesn't suit you.

1352
01:58:07,250 --> 01:58:08,340
I was scared.

1353
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:24,000
I can fend for myself.
What is this macho rubbish?

1354
01:58:25,790 --> 01:58:28,460
â€œI'll jump for you, I'll die for you.â€
Don't jump.

1355
01:58:43,830 --> 01:58:46,580
You think I had no clue
why you took Dad out every Sunday?

1356
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:52,620
I had two boyfriends in college.
At the same time, okay?

1357
01:58:56,160 --> 01:58:58,330
Then I thought maybe I was piling on

1358
01:58:58,700 --> 01:59:00,160
or my dad thing put you off.

1359
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,170
No.

1360
01:59:02,040 --> 01:59:04,750
In fact, when I saw you
with your dad for the first time,

1361
01:59:04,870 --> 01:59:07,080
that's when I started liking you.

1362
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:10,910
Say something nice about me.

1363
01:59:11,080 --> 01:59:14,240
About my looks, my body. I mean, come on.

1364
01:59:22,500 --> 01:59:23,380
Should I propose now?

1365
01:59:24,080 --> 01:59:26,120
No. You'll botch this up as well.

1366
01:59:27,540 --> 01:59:28,420
Then?

1367
01:59:41,830 --> 01:59:43,120
So, do I wear this?

1368
01:59:43,290 --> 01:59:46,920
No, you make me wear it,
but first answer me, will you?

1369
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:00,950
Have some patience.

1370
02:00:04,250 --> 02:00:05,130
How are you?

1371
02:00:05,700 --> 02:00:06,580
I'm fine.

1372
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:09,710
-I've checked the water tank. It's full.
-Oh, great.

1373
02:00:41,450 --> 02:00:43,160
What's wrong with you?

1374
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:44,840
You're joking at this moment?

1375
02:00:44,910 --> 02:00:46,080
Are you crazy?

1376
02:00:46,450 --> 02:00:48,530
Grow up.

1377
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,500
What is wrong with you?

1378
02:00:55,250 --> 02:00:58,130
First tell me, is there a lot of
coffee brewing at you place?

1379
02:01:06,040 --> 02:01:07,500
I won.

1380
02:01:07,580 --> 02:01:09,740
What? Yes, it's a bit noisy.

1381
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:13,790
I won
the Juhu Citizen's Association elections.

1382
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:16,410
Yes, I beat Kamana.

1383
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:17,530
You were right.

1384
02:01:17,620 --> 02:01:23,030
Jayesh Garodia is the new president
of Juhu Citizen's Association.

1385
02:01:23,160 --> 02:01:25,580
What does this mean?

1386
02:02:11,410 --> 02:02:12,830
JBU!

1387
02:03:14,500 --> 02:03:16,500
-Very good.
-Lay off.

1388
02:03:20,410 --> 02:03:21,950
-Come on.
-Come on.

1389
02:03:33,290 --> 02:03:34,420
Is it okay now?

1390
02:03:35,660 --> 02:03:36,950
Guys, come closer, please!
