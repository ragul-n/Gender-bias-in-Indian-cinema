00:00:03,041 --> 00:00:06,176
Smoking and drinking
are injurious to health

00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:53,912
(Music)

3
00:01:03,588 --> 00:01:04,615
My name is Gopi.

4
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,545
I belong to Amalapuram.

5
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:09,464
I came to Hyderabad on an important work.

6
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:15,274
My bad time started when I planned to go
back to my place after finishing my work.

7
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,803
I was busy with my work,...

8
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:21,598
...so couldn't realise that someone else
is trying to finish me.

9
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,798
So I had to repay with a massive.

10
00:01:25,116 --> 00:01:28,219
I am at the edge of my death.

11
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:32,219
Till yesterday my life was fun filled...

12
00:01:32,662 --> 00:01:35,898
...but now is filled with sorrow.
The reason behind it is ...

13
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:36,827
...my ego.

14
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:44,171
EGO

15
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:51,674
'Ego. This is freely available
all over the world.'

16
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:55,220
'So almost everyone has it in tonnes.'

17
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:58,507
'These too has a little more stock of it.'

18
00:01:58,679 --> 00:01:59,655
'Gopi Naidu.'

19
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:01,272
'Induvardhan Naidu.'

20
00:02:01,352 --> 00:02:04,930
'They are the logos of ego.
Their egos started here.'

21
00:02:06,444 --> 00:02:08,195
'Hey, take your vehicle back.'

22
00:02:08,275 --> 00:02:09,428
'You take it back.'

23
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:11,322
'They left with ego...'

24
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:13,845
'...but the tractors remained
there for many years.'

25
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:18,137
'Gopi Naidu had two kids.'

26
00:02:18,217 --> 00:02:20,472
'But with the ego that
Indravardhan Naidu had four...'

27
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:23,605
'...he had his wife reoperated
and had two more.'

28
00:02:23,962 --> 00:02:26,448
'Induvardhan Naidu has 800 acres...'

29
00:02:26,528 --> 00:02:28,978
'...but with the ego that
Gopi Naidu has 1000 acres,...'

30
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:31,605
'...he purchased 200 acres
paying double rate.'

31
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:34,513
'So the ego levels reached the sky.'

32
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,194
'Induvardhan Naidu's is good land...'

33
00:02:37,274 --> 00:02:39,627
'...he celebrated every year
with good crops.'

34
00:02:39,707 --> 00:02:43,951
'Gopi Naidu's barren land has no
water facility. So he was always sad.'

35
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:45,832
'But his grief for no crops in the land
was less when compared to ...'

36
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:48,989
'...the grief when he sees
Induvardhan Naidu's celebrations.'

37
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:53,480
'He finally found a way
to satisfy his ego.'

38
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:56,205
'He used his clout for
good crop yield and...'

39
00:02:56,285 --> 00:02:58,453
'...he got Height casting scheme
granted for his barren land.'

40
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,821
'Sir, he got water to his lands.'

41
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:04,941
'With tension that his plan will not work
before Gopi Naidu's government plan,...'

42
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:08,033
'...with high BP, had heart stroke
and died in the fields.'

43
00:03:08,113 --> 00:03:10,354
'Sir, he is no more.'

44
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:14,127
'Hearing that news,
Gopi Naidu ate 1kg sweets...'

45
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,677
'...and died due to high sugar.'

46
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:17,150
'Just similar to their egos,...'

47
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,554
'...their BP and sugar levels fluctuated,
they had to settle in the photo frames...'

48
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,554
'...on the walls.'

49
00:03:23,932 --> 00:03:27,814
'The one who studies in school and the one
who learns lesson, will come up in life.'

50
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:31,911
'But their heirs had done
Phds in ego lessons.'

51
00:03:32,095 --> 00:03:34,549
'Cinema theatres plays
only four shows per day...'

52
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:37,911
'...but they show off their egos
24 hours a day.'

53
00:03:38,603 --> 00:03:41,155
'They are more seen at Panchayats
than at their homes.'

54
00:03:41,235 --> 00:03:43,025
'Except resolving their issues...'

55
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:45,937
'...there is no other issue to resolve,
for the Panchayat head.'

56
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,585
'Since the issue was not
resolved for years,...'

57
00:03:48,665 --> 00:03:52,261
'...the Panchayat arranged
a fence between the houses.'

58
00:03:52,693 --> 00:03:55,504
'The heirs of these egos are
Indu and Gopi in our story.'

59
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:57,450
'Watch out their egos.'

60
00:04:12,093 --> 00:04:13,334

61
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:25,560

63
00:04:34,547 --> 00:04:35,325
(Whistles)

64
00:04:35,405 --> 00:04:41,487
â™ªThere is a talk that this guy is perfect
with jet speed and like a rocket.â™ª

65
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:53,891
â™ªThis guy has craze that he is like
a bullet and that he is sweet.â™ª

66
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:05,900
â™ªLike a theatre which has class and mass,
like a fare that has drums and dance...

67
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:12,873
â™ª...it's fun and joy filled wherever I goâ™ª

68
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:49,696
â™ªI am the betting cock which keeps
raising its knife in the battle.â™ª

69
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:55,869
â™ªI have the habit of helping
others in my nerves.â™ª

70
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:01,663
â™ªLike a chilly with thunder
and lightning...â™ª

71
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:04,874
â™ª...like a colorful rangoli
with a girl's beauty...â™ª

72
00:06:04,954 --> 00:06:08,209
â™ª...it's like Sankranthi celebration
wherever I go.â™ª

73
00:06:08,289 --> 00:06:11,662
â™ªMy words are like 'Teen Maar'.â™ª

74
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:26,548
(Temple bell)

75
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:33,846
â™ªNanda Gopala, Brunda Govinda will come...â™ª

76
00:06:34,182 --> 00:06:40,202
â™ª...dear to young girls, I am coming
to you expecting a gift...â™ª

77
00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:45,305
â™ª...with dream filled lightings.â™ª

78
00:07:04,034 --> 00:07:07,115
â™ªHere, there, everywhere and
everyone is a relation to me.

79
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:13,264
â™ªWe call each other as
'hey man', 'hey cousin'â™ª

80
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:22,227
â™ªNothing matches the taste of 'Pulasa'
that swim against the river stream.â™ª

81
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:29,049
â™ªSimilar is my love. Wherever I go,
I entertain everyone.â™ª

82
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,087
(Camera snaps)

83
00:07:55,865 --> 00:07:57,509
'His name is Whatsapp Kattappa.'

84
00:07:57,589 --> 00:08:01,271
'That Kattappa is a slave to the king and
this Kattappa is a slave of whatsapp.'

85
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:04,348
'He neither drinks water nor eats food
if he is not online on whatsapp.'

86
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:06,348
'He is a slave to whatsapp...'

87
00:08:06,428 --> 00:08:11,577
'...maintains a battery at the back
and cell phones on the handle...'

88
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:15,134
'...with internet connections and forcing
everyone into the whatsapp group...'

89
00:08:15,214 --> 00:08:17,394
'...whatever happens in the village,
he posts them...'

90
00:08:17,474 --> 00:08:20,042
'...and feels excited when everyone says
hatsoff through whatsapp.'

91
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:22,344
Venkatesh, it seems Indu
bought a new bike.

92
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:23,436
Yeah, I am checking it.

93
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:29,328
Who are these?

94
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,117
Why are they following me?
Drive carefully, madam.

95
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:34,293
Don't raise the accelarator.

96
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,260
What is that speed? Watch out.

97
00:08:38,487 --> 00:08:40,066
There will be a dint
if it meets with accident.

98
00:08:42,325 --> 00:08:43,700
It's my vehicle. It's my wish.

99
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,727
I will drive in the pits. I will punch
it to the vehicle coming in front.

100
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:48,024
Who are you to tell me?

101
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:49,386
The vehicle worth 70,000 rupees...

102
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:52,143
...it seems you are selling for 7000.
So I came from very far.

103
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,644
Did I say that I will sell it
for 7000 rupees?

104
00:08:54,724 --> 00:08:57,104
I think you have mistaken
me for someone else.

105
00:08:57,184 --> 00:09:00,157
You can change what you say
but you can't change the pic in OLX.

106
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,438
I didn't upload this.

107
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,677
There must have been some mistake.

108
00:09:04,757 --> 00:09:06,424
Are you planning to raise the price,
seeing 20 of them here?

109
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,093
If you want we will pay you 100 extra.
We will select one of us through chits.

110
00:09:10,173 --> 00:09:13,844
Are you okay? She will kill us, run.
I will break all your heads.

111
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,646
We sell vehicles, blue vehicles,
at a very cheap cost...

112
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:22,829
...in OLX.
Gopi.

113
00:09:23,294 --> 00:09:26,004
I have a target in my life.
Is it a coconut?

114
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:29,085
(Slaps)
Is it doctor, collector or CM?

115
00:09:29,165 --> 00:09:30,793
These are all minute things for me.

116
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:33,074
What else could be the target?
Indu.

117
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:34,566
What will you do with Indu?
(Slaps)

118
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:35,631
My God!
Not, her...

119
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:40,814
...but when I crush her ego under my leg..
Hey, man. Your ego is coming.

120
00:09:41,268 --> 00:09:43,214
Buramma...

121
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,169
What, Gopi?

122
00:09:46,249 --> 00:09:48,883
You said you will bring me cheese.
Sorry, Gopi.

123
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:51,834
My friend, Papayamma's elder daughter
has come to age...

124
00:09:51,914 --> 00:09:54,180
...I went to Pithapuram.
Okay, go, go.

125
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,910
They should be jailed for all this.

126
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,110
(Laughs)

127
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:02,726
Gopi keeps calling me
with my grand mother's name...

128
00:10:03,104 --> 00:10:04,347
...and is hurting my ego.

129
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,326
Just bring all the Gopi's in the village.

130
00:10:06,596 --> 00:10:08,925
Just get lost, idiots.

131
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:13,000
Why did you bring only one of them?
There are 11 in all. But 10 aren't seen...

132
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,265
...only he is available at a shop.
Talk to him and settle the rate.

133
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:17,641
What are you talking about?

134
00:10:17,721 --> 00:10:20,625
Do you think I am a teddy bear in
fancy shop or a beer in a wine shop?

135
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:23,483
Brother, the matter is that ...

136
00:10:23,563 --> 00:10:25,683
...you should roam around that Gopi...

137
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,050
...and I should scold him,
pretensing to scold you.

138
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:30,634
For that, I will pay you
a salary of 50,000 rupees.

139
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:35,164
Here is a lakh rupees. Give me your
account number and I will pay you.

140
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,380
When there were 11 Gopi's
in the village...

141
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,720
...do you know why 5 of them are in Dubai?
Why?

142
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,493
This Gopi has sent them to Dubai.

143
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,936
Why is he so interested in them?

144
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:45,374
That is not love, that is ego.

145
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:48,462
With an ego that no one else
should have Gopi's name...

146
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,749
...he sent them all to Dubai
with invalid passports.

147
00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:53,705
When they called that
they are coming to India,...

148
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:58,214
...he blackmailed that he will inform
the police about their invalid passports.

149
00:10:58,294 --> 00:11:00,723
Promising 3 Gopi's that
he will make them stars,...

150
00:11:00,803 --> 00:11:01,815
...he made them sign agreement for serials.

151
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:03,631
They will not come back as far as I know.

152
00:11:03,711 --> 00:11:06,193
What about the other two?
If you go to seashore, you'll find them.

153
00:11:06,273 --> 00:11:08,614
Are they catching fish?
No, they are gone mad...

154
00:11:08,694 --> 00:11:09,760
...unable to handle his ego.

155
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,755
I went to them and asked
if their names are Gopi.

156
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:14,787
They threw stones at me.
That's fine.

157
00:11:14,867 --> 00:11:17,511
Even if they are gone, you are here.

158
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:18,571
Oh.

159
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,340
Gopi.

160
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,296
Please don't call me by that name.

161
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:26,372
I am handicapped because of the name.

162
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,054
My name is not Gopi.

163
00:11:28,963 --> 00:11:32,314
My name is Sunder.

164
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:33,709
(Cries)

165
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:35,060
Stop it.

166
00:11:35,449 --> 00:11:36,854
Why are you crying?

167
00:11:36,934 --> 00:11:38,151
We bacame emotional.

168
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:40,681
Not emotion. I will make him do motion.

169
00:11:40,761 --> 00:11:41,978
By this we can realise that...

170
00:11:42,058 --> 00:11:44,659
...it is difficult to get person
named Gopi.

171
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:48,259
Idea.

172
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:52,693
Thanks, madam.

173
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,720
It's so cute.

174
00:11:56,693 --> 00:11:58,196
Ramudu...

175
00:11:58,434 --> 00:11:59,933
Indu bought a dog for 3 lakhs.

176
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:01,295
Yeah. I am checking that.

177
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:02,938
She is very strange.

178
00:12:03,018 --> 00:12:04,052
Uh-oh.

179
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:07,252
If she buys a dog,
we will purchase it's sister.

180
00:12:07,332 --> 00:12:09,176
Hey, man. Who is Gopi here?

181
00:12:09,256 --> 00:12:10,916
Are you gone blind?

182
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,105
Can't you see hero-like Gopi?

183
00:12:13,185 --> 00:12:14,597
Sir, you got a parcel.

184
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:16,175
Some fans must have sent it.

185
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,943
Please sign here.
Not sign...

186
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:21,548
...ask for autograph. Its Gopi here.

187
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:23,871
Is it cash or cheque?
How much is it?

188
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,498
Seventy.
Why cheque for seventy?

189
00:12:27,136 --> 00:12:28,649
I will give you cash. Here.

190
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:30,606
Why is he giving 100?

191
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:33,258
Do you have 30 change?
Why would I give you 30?

192
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:35,074
You want to take 30 as tip?

193
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:37,907
Don't play games with me.

194
00:12:37,987 --> 00:12:40,826
Tip? Do you know what it is?

195
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:42,620
What is this?
Iphone.

196
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,833
Gopi has bought an IPhone.

197
00:12:44,913 --> 00:12:46,347
(Camera clicks)
(Message sound)

198
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:50,509
Did you book an iPhone, Gopi?

199
00:12:50,682 --> 00:12:52,736
You are highlight to Amalapuram.

200
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:54,640
What do you think of our Gopi?

201
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,791
He stays updated.

202
00:12:56,871 --> 00:12:58,824
When did I book iPhone?

203
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:03,656
You trapped me?
It's not complete yet.

204
00:13:04,218 --> 00:13:05,592
There is so much ahead.

205
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,096
Brother, stay here for two minutes.

206
00:13:08,176 --> 00:13:10,381
I will go to ATM and get the cash.

207
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:14,079
Here.

208
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:16,627
Keep 70,000 in your bag.

209
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:18,227
Take a thousand as tip.

210
00:13:18,307 --> 00:13:19,849
Give me the iPhone box.

211
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,114
Hey, iPhone.

212
00:13:21,795 --> 00:13:23,006
â™ªMango.â™ª

213
00:13:23,492 --> 00:13:24,660
'His name is Nalla Enkanna.'

214
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,267
'He runs a pan shop.'

215
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,050
'He is very interested
in becoming a father.'

216
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:30,299
'But it's very difficult for this birth.'

217
00:13:30,483 --> 00:13:33,942
'So he is raising a cock and treating it
s own daughter.'

218
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:35,888
'It's his life.'

219
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:38,205
'By the way, where is he going?'

220
00:13:38,832 --> 00:13:41,048
Don't worry, dear.

221
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:42,832
You are the beauty of Amalapuram.

222
00:13:42,912 --> 00:13:44,313
Hey, Nalla Enkanna.
What?

223
00:13:44,393 --> 00:13:46,064
You look like a groom.
Where are you going?

224
00:13:46,144 --> 00:13:50,200
To buy branded clothes for Mahalakshmi
in Rajahmundry shopping mall...

225
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,098
...and to show her Mahesh babu
movie in multiplex.

226
00:13:53,178 --> 00:13:54,438
Where is Mahalakshmi?

227
00:13:54,518 --> 00:13:55,898
Have you gone blind?

228
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:57,433
She is in my hands.

229
00:13:57,513 --> 00:13:59,066
Is this your Mahalakshmi?

230
00:13:59,146 --> 00:14:02,936
This is my only daughter
and heir of my property too.

231
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,163
So whoever marries her will
be the heir of your property?

232
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:09,616
Are you trying to trap my daughter and
rob my property?

233
00:14:09,696 --> 00:14:12,563
I will get my daughter married to
a jobless person rather than...

234
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,118
...giving to useless fellows like you.

235
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:16,999
Move away, you useless fellows.

236
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:18,253
He spoiled our dignity.

237
00:14:18,914 --> 00:14:19,717
Nobody has seen us, right?

238
00:14:19,797 --> 00:14:23,865
This night we have to eat his
Mahalakshmi in munching.

239
00:14:26,912 --> 00:14:27,647
(Music)

240
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:32,501
â™ªBuramma with cheeks like 'Boori'...â™ª

241
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:41,756
â™ªIf she puts her feet, that'll be the end,
if she comes walking, then it's hell.â™ª

242
00:14:42,145 --> 00:14:42,988
â™ªHey, man.â™ª

243
00:14:47,298 --> 00:14:51,222
â™ªHer body is filled with snob,
I will bring it down.â™ª

244
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,887
â™ªRama.â™ª

245
00:14:53,428 --> 00:14:57,292
â™ªLook at her long plat,
moving like a buffalo tail.â™ª

246
00:14:59,627 --> 00:15:03,422
â™ªIf I see her neck, I feel filthy.â™ª

247
00:15:05,828 --> 00:15:10,206
â™ªHer waist is like dung
and it is a horrible dream.â™ª

248
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:15,364
â™ªSee her swings, I will show my attitude.â™ª

249
00:15:15,444 --> 00:15:21,494
â™ªSee her swings, I will show my attitude.â™ª

250
00:15:21,574 --> 00:15:24,359
â™ªSee her swings, I will show my attitude.â™ª

251
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:27,442
â™ªSee her swings, I will show my attitude.â™ª

252
00:15:27,522 --> 00:15:31,280
â™ªSee her swings, I will show my attitude.â™ª

253
00:15:32,674 --> 00:15:35,874
(Music)

254
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,367
Dear journalists and electronic
media people, please sit.

255
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:44,318
Youth in Amalapuram...

256
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:47,311
...has to shut down the whatsapp
and facebook by 9pm.

257
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:49,290
If I find lighting in any cell,...

258
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,808
...they will get coating. After 10pm,
drunkards should ...

259
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:52,976
...not be seen anywhere near...

260
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:56,111
...bar shops.

261
00:15:56,191 --> 00:15:58,747
Now I am going to tell about ladies.

262
00:15:58,827 --> 00:16:01,039
Ladies, don't become
the slaves of TV serials.

263
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:02,336
You become the slaves of your husbands.

264
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,958
If anyone does eve teasing,...

265
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:05,201
...I will encounter them.

266
00:16:05,281 --> 00:16:06,834
If you try to rob, I will tear you off.

267
00:16:06,914 --> 00:16:09,131
Any dirty work was only before I was here.

268
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:11,055
Once I am here, close everything.

269
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:15,325
If anyone faces a problem, 9505111155...

270
00:16:15,405 --> 00:16:17,152
...just give a missed call on this number.

271
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:19,390
I will be in front of you
faster than the wind.

272
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,995
Morning or afternoon or mid night...

273
00:16:22,075 --> 00:16:24,806
The clock on the wall might take rest...

274
00:16:24,886 --> 00:16:27,206
...but this Aavugadda Apparao ...

275
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,244
...will do duty 24X7...

276
00:16:28,324 --> 00:16:30,552
...and will put my mark in Amalapuram
before I leave.

277
00:16:31,979 --> 00:16:33,817
Hey 302.
Yes, Sir.

278
00:16:33,897 --> 00:16:36,455
Did you get the stock of Putarekulu?
Not yet, Sir.

279
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:37,806
Listen to me carefully.

280
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:40,241
As long as I am on duty in Amalapuram...

281
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:43,571
I don't care for a stick in my hand
but I should have Putareku in my mouth,

282
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:45,301
Or else I will show you all serial.

283
00:16:45,381 --> 00:16:46,814
I will get it done right away, Sir.

284
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,036
Ok, Sir.

285
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,933
There is a missed call.

286
00:16:53,716 --> 00:16:55,846
'I fell down.'

287
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,619
From where? Wall or roof?

288
00:16:57,825 --> 00:16:59,176
In your love net.

289
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,453
Who are you?

290
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:03,891
I have just seen
Power Star Pawan Kalyan's...

291
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:05,935
...grace in you.

292
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:09,308
Listening to your punch dialogues
like Balayya Babu ...

293
00:17:09,388 --> 00:17:10,897
...I forgot about my lunch.

294
00:17:10,977 --> 00:17:11,994
Oh my!

295
00:17:12,074 --> 00:17:16,178
Hey you. Show these things
to the youth sitting on walls.

296
00:17:16,351 --> 00:17:19,561
Not to me. If you have any problem,
call me.

297
00:17:19,778 --> 00:17:20,686
Disconnect thecall first.

298
00:17:21,049 --> 00:17:21,968
Have you seen this?

299
00:17:22,048 --> 00:17:24,487
I was just seen in TV.
Proposals already started.

300
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:31,298
Who is this crispy figure, Sir?

301
00:17:31,378 --> 00:17:31,994
(Slaps)

302
00:17:32,074 --> 00:17:32,999
She is my wife, man.

303
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:35,367
Enough of your extras.

304
00:17:35,447 --> 00:17:36,783
Put your hand down first.

305
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:40,221
I don't have a chance neither to beat her
nor to salute her.

306
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,502
Why won't she?
What is it?

307
00:17:42,582 --> 00:17:45,036
Why are you so excited seeing the mikes?

308
00:17:45,116 --> 00:17:47,230
Are you showing me your power indirectly?

309
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,463
No, dear Putareku.

310
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,484
Even if a police is like a useless
firework at home,...

311
00:17:50,564 --> 00:17:51,576
...once he comes out,...

312
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:53,063
...he should blast like a firework.

313
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:55,538
CI Sir is also a normal
husband to his wife.

314
00:17:55,618 --> 00:17:57,225
My Putareku in your mouth?
Oh my God!

315
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:59,765
She is like a hurried Putareku.

316
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:02,425
What will happen to me without you?

317
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:04,676
Hey, stop. Jaggery Putareku in your mouth.

318
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:07,227
What is that voice?

319
00:18:07,307 --> 00:18:12,070
I got used to it after shouting at tap,
vegetable shop, kirana shop & quota shop.

320
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,628
By the way what's your name, lady?
My name is Saroja, Sir.

321
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,136
He calls me as Saroo, with love.

322
00:18:17,216 --> 00:18:21,273
Why are you spitting?
It's been 3 days. God knows where he is.

323
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:24,116
When I am scolding anyone,
they are scolding in reverse.

324
00:18:24,196 --> 00:18:25,219
Why will they not?

325
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:28,469
Are they your husband to keep quite
when you unnecessarily scold? It's public.

326
00:18:28,771 --> 00:18:30,594
As far as my expectation goes,...

327
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:32,361
...he must have run away somewhere.

328
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:35,388
May be he was afraid that he will
not get a chance to speak again.

329
00:18:35,468 --> 00:18:38,303
How can you say it so strongly?

330
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,076
(Mutters)
I felt the same way many times.

331
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:42,962
Come home I will tear you away.

332
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:45,481
That's fine. Give a complaint. 302,...
Sir.

333
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:46,292
Take the mobile number.

334
00:18:46,372 --> 00:18:49,319
Yes, Sir.
He forgot his mobile also.

335
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:51,816
It's charged fully.

336
00:18:51,896 --> 00:18:54,238
May be she knew that charging is down.
You shut up.

337
00:18:54,318 --> 00:18:56,270
Saroja, come with me.

338
00:18:56,638 --> 00:18:59,398
When your wife is beside you,
you are asking her to come with you?

339
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:02,717
It's a part of the duty.
I am also a part of you.

340
00:19:02,797 --> 00:19:04,659
Fine. Both of you get on.
Get on?

341
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:05,647
Jeep.

342
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,458
(Cries)

343
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:14,326
Saroja, stop crying.
Without you, whom will I live with?

344
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,202
Wifi is connecting somewhere.

345
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:21,627
302 some Bajjila Bujji is being connected.

346
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:23,454
Let's see who that Bajji is.

347
00:19:23,534 --> 00:19:24,643
Hey, you.

348
00:19:24,723 --> 00:19:25,973
Where is Bajjila Bujji's house?

349
00:19:26,053 --> 00:19:28,016
CI Sir, I think you are in a
good mood today.

350
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:29,778
(Mutters)I don't have that luck.
Just shut up.

351
00:19:29,858 --> 00:19:31,599
He is here on duty.

352
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,772
Saroja, your husband is inside. Go...

353
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:37,004
You go and knock the door.
He will come out.

354
00:19:37,084 --> 00:19:39,339
(Door knocks)

355
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:42,103
Saroja.
(Cries)

356
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:44,709
You have set a new house
just beside your house.

357
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,163
You idiot husband.

358
00:19:47,243 --> 00:19:50,287
Whome will I live with
if you are not with me?

359
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:52,056
Is husband important or living for her?

360
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:53,851
Shall I ask her?
Go and ask.

361
00:19:53,931 --> 00:19:56,424
Didn't you get anyone else to trap?

362
00:19:56,504 --> 00:19:59,678
Didn't you see CI Sir?

363
00:19:59,758 --> 00:20:01,159
Did you see my image in the public?

364
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:03,315
See the reaction here.

365
00:20:03,395 --> 00:20:05,931
Hey stop it.

366
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:08,526
Your life got spoiled due to
your own harshness.

367
00:20:08,606 --> 00:20:10,115
Look at him once.

368
00:20:10,195 --> 00:20:13,494
If you ever gave him anything with
smiling face he would never come here.

369
00:20:13,574 --> 00:20:15,256
Please pardon me, CI Sir.

370
00:20:15,678 --> 00:20:18,607
I will never scold you again, dear.

371
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:21,137
I will stay silent for 6 days a week.

372
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:25,676
That one day also I will just keep quiet.

373
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:27,856
Please come. Let's go home.

374
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:30,487
Sorry, Sarroo. I will never
leave you again.

375
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:32,519
You are saying no to this Bajjila Bujji?

376
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:34,610
Get lost. My wife has changed.

377
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,653
Why do I care for any Bajjila Bujji?

378
00:20:36,837 --> 00:20:38,783
Let's go, Sarroo.
Take this phone, Sarroo.

379
00:20:39,496 --> 00:20:40,934
Let's pass on a message to the public.

380
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:42,956
Give, Sir.
Bring the camera to a postition.

381
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:45,355
Take care of your husbands.

382
00:20:45,435 --> 00:20:47,506
Take care of them like small kids.

383
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:49,582
Give them some freedom.

384
00:20:49,662 --> 00:20:51,171
Only then your family ...

385
00:20:51,251 --> 00:20:53,441
...will be as sweet as
Atreyapuram Putareku.

386
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:55,679
Is this message for public
or for your wife?

387
00:20:55,949 --> 00:20:59,214
Nalla Enkanna's hen taste
was ultimate, man.

388
00:20:59,294 --> 00:21:01,571
God knows what he fed it with,
but the taste is super.

389
00:21:01,651 --> 00:21:03,452
You idiots...

390
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:06,643
...you raped and killed my daughter.

391
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,308
With curse of my Mahalakshmi...

392
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:10,459
...you will get chicken guinea and die.

393
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,324
When you eat Chicken-65,
a piece will stuck in the throat...

394
00:21:13,404 --> 00:21:14,595
...and you will die.

395
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:18,679
If you eat chicken curry,
you will die of adulteration.

396
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:20,982
Listen to what I am saying.

397
00:21:21,062 --> 00:21:23,955
My Mahalakshmi will become a ghost
and take revenge.

398
00:21:24,035 --> 00:21:26,452
I curse you as a father.

399
00:21:26,532 --> 00:21:28,679
If you come near me
I will hit you with a stone.

400
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:31,749
You and your hen. Go away.

401
00:21:33,739 --> 00:21:35,663
Puli.
Who are you, girl?

402
00:21:35,743 --> 00:21:38,236
When you walk so gracefully,...

403
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:39,912
...on Amalapuram roads,...

404
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:42,409
'...it's like a tiger in duty
wearing a police dress.'

405
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:44,755
Who are you? Every time you call...

406
00:21:44,835 --> 00:21:46,723
...you keep praising me like
an anchor in an audio function?

407
00:21:46,803 --> 00:21:49,210
Yesterday when I saw your
wifi creativity...

408
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,448
...my heart just diverted your way.

409
00:21:51,528 --> 00:21:53,567
I am already a used flower.

410
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,524
It will not bloom again.

411
00:21:55,604 --> 00:22:00,154
You go and try someone else.
Whether you are a used flower or stove...

412
00:22:00,234 --> 00:22:01,840
...my love is only with you.

413
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,506
Once fried papad can't...
Please stop all this.

414
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:06,619
You have an image of Rajnikanth...

415
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:10,341
...and you are being troubled
with Suryakantham-like wife?

416
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:12,849
Yeah, it is true.
You are a powerful police.

417
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:16,675
You have become a pin in her chain.

418
00:22:16,755 --> 00:22:18,567
Yeah, it is true.
You are bearing this...

419
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:20,351
...but I can't bear all this.

420
00:22:20,431 --> 00:22:22,427
If you say yes, my complete love is yours.

421
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,319
If you say no,
my heart is filled with sorrow.

422
00:22:24,399 --> 00:22:25,778
That is not the point.

423
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,778
You are loving me, let's fix on it.

424
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:29,762
Your words are motivating me.

425
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:31,622
Your words erased my sorrows.

426
00:22:31,702 --> 00:22:34,033
Your voice reminded me
that I have a choice.

427
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:36,541
But I am married and you are unmarried...

428
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,303
That is tha magic of love.

429
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:39,471
I liked your logic.

430
00:22:39,551 --> 00:22:41,114
Come in front of me and express your love.

431
00:22:41,194 --> 00:22:43,363
There is kick in hidden love.

432
00:22:43,443 --> 00:22:44,401
That is my luck.

433
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:50,533
Why is everyone going like that?

434
00:22:50,613 --> 00:22:54,312
Greetings.
Ask if there is issue with ATM and Banks.

435
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:55,506
Where are they going?

436
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:57,128
Hey, stop.

437
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,382
Hey Verri Venkanna...

438
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:00,236
...where are you all going?

439
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:03,148
Indu is grandly celebrating
naming ceremony of her dog.

440
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:04,381
Naming ceremony of a dog!

441
00:23:04,461 --> 00:23:06,089
With 32 different dishes,...

442
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:07,105
...they are serving lunch.

443
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,554
Were you not invited?

444
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:10,324
We don't go to such dog's ceremonies.

445
00:23:10,404 --> 00:23:13,276
Do you think dogs will
feel bad if you come?

446
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:15,265
I will miss the varieties, if I am late.

447
00:23:15,345 --> 00:23:16,443
Leave my hand. I need to go.

448
00:23:16,523 --> 00:23:19,103
You guys are idiots.
You will live even drinking beers.

449
00:23:19,183 --> 00:23:20,045
Uh-oh.

450
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:24,186
My girl gave a missed call.

451
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:25,721
(Music)

452
00:23:25,801 --> 00:23:26,597
Dear,...

453
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:28,056
(Cries)

454
00:23:28,294 --> 00:23:29,440
Why are you crying?

455
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:32,174
(Cries)

456
00:23:32,254 --> 00:23:33,449
Stop the vehicle.

457
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:38,466
One guy is teasing me here.
Who is he?

458
00:23:38,844 --> 00:23:39,957
Gopi.

459
00:23:40,037 --> 00:23:42,260
What does he work?
He is an idiot in the village.

460
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,212
What did he say?
He is calling and asking to meet.

461
00:23:45,292 --> 00:23:49,082
What else did he say?
He is messaging and asking me to talk.

462
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,897
What else?
He is bothering me on whatsapp.

463
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:55,421
What else? Threatening that he will
post fake pics on facebook.

464
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:56,470
He is done.

465
00:23:57,097 --> 00:23:59,335
You file a complaint
and I will see his end.

466
00:23:59,415 --> 00:24:02,210
He said he will kill if I raise complaint.
How dare he?

467
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,229
He is stubborn.

468
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:07,445
He raped and killed Mahalakshmi, as well.

469
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:09,283
He threatened her father, Nalla Enkanna
that he will kill him,...

470
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:11,553
...if he filed complaint.

471
00:24:11,633 --> 00:24:14,610
You disconnect the call.
I will see his end.

472
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:15,637
(Smiles)

473
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:16,999
(Smiles)

474
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:18,902
Give a cigarette.

475
00:24:19,118 --> 00:24:21,551
Okay, Sir.

476
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,183
Are you Nalla Enkanna?

477
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:26,319
What is this, Sir?
Only for educated persons like you...

478
00:24:26,399 --> 00:24:28,698
...I have written this board
with big letters.

479
00:24:28,778 --> 00:24:31,714
We are police and we ask it.

480
00:24:31,794 --> 00:24:33,249
Oh, so is it?
Then what?

481
00:24:33,329 --> 00:24:35,404
Do you have a daughter named Mahalakshmi?

482
00:24:35,484 --> 00:24:36,794
(Cries)

483
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:39,999
I had an elder daughter, Mahalakshmi.

484
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:45,265
Gopi and his gang raped her ...

485
00:24:45,345 --> 00:24:48,325
...and killed my daughter.

486
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,681
That's fine. Don't get emotional.

487
00:24:50,908 --> 00:24:53,795
Come to the station and file a complaint.
I will see for his lockup death.

488
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:55,696
Sir...
Yes.

489
00:24:55,776 --> 00:25:00,561
Many CIs and SIs come and go...

490
00:25:01,231 --> 00:25:02,907
...but he is local, Sir.

491
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,938
If we deal with him...

492
00:25:05,018 --> 00:25:08,012
...he will Venkatalakshmi also ...
Why is afraid of him?

493
00:25:08,092 --> 00:25:11,137
...will be ruined, Sir.
His cries are unbearable.

494
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:14,841
They raped his daughter, Mahalakshmi, Sir.

495
00:25:15,025 --> 00:25:16,502
You are also crying.

496
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,371
You cool down.

497
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,885
Enkanna.
Sir!

498
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:23,410
I will sing finishing song
for his illegal activities.

499
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,422
You go ahead with your business.

500
00:25:24,502 --> 00:25:25,561
Let's go.

501
00:25:25,641 --> 00:25:27,031
Sir, you didn't pay me.

502
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,156
We don't have change, man.

503
00:25:28,236 --> 00:25:30,567
When did you give?
You know it, right?

504
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:32,946
(Carroms sound)

505
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,346
(Police siren)

506
00:25:43,781 --> 00:25:45,598
We don't polish. It's there.

507
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:47,684
It's not for polish, man...

508
00:25:47,764 --> 00:25:50,041
We will finish you.
(Gunshots)

509
00:25:50,121 --> 00:25:51,360
I am here to finish you.

510
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,147
(Music)

511
00:25:54,784 --> 00:25:56,428
Now let me see, which hole
will you push the coin to.

512
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:02,341
(Carrom sound)

513
00:26:02,421 --> 00:26:04,620
(Screams)

514
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,425
Mr. Circle Inspector...

515
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:08,782
...Show your irritation on culprits...

516
00:26:08,862 --> 00:26:10,976
not on civilians, like us.
Hey...

517
00:26:11,056 --> 00:26:12,306
...you, full cutting...

518
00:26:12,685 --> 00:26:15,043
...you have life only till we find proofs.

519
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,730
Once you are caught, your life will be
dedicated to the jail.

520
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,789
All the best.

521
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:18,838
Take rest.

522
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:20,340
(Music)

523
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,286
I will break you all down.

524
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,485
Trailer is super.

525
00:26:26,565 --> 00:26:27,685
Yeah.

526
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:31,826
Hey!

527
00:26:32,874 --> 00:26:36,455
I am seeing the lion in
Discovery channel...

528
00:26:36,535 --> 00:26:38,293
...directly in our streets.

529
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:40,433
Don't praise me like that.

530
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:42,693
I might encounter someone in that emotion.

531
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:44,563
Give me.

532
00:26:45,095 --> 00:26:46,025
(Opens mouth)

533
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:50,479
Ace, King, Queen...

534
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,111
...you are caught now.
In this manner, we will go after show.

535
00:26:54,191 --> 00:26:57,023
I just went back to my olden days.

536
00:26:57,401 --> 00:26:58,493
Charge.

537
00:26:58,709 --> 00:27:00,007
Hey.

538
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,612
I will divert you to underground
and will see your end.

539
00:27:02,692 --> 00:27:04,449
Why will you arrest us?

540
00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:07,368
Don't act like Ramesh in
Five Star advertisement.

541
00:27:07,448 --> 00:27:09,833
Will you arrest us if we play
Ram-Sita game?

542
00:27:10,189 --> 00:27:10,957
What?

543
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:14,773
My eyes never cheated me in these
many years of my service.

544
00:27:15,674 --> 00:27:18,020
First time I went to raiding
and returned empty handed.

545
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,988
Why Sir? We already siezed Putarekulu.

546
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,063
Don't put punches on me. I will kill you.

547
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,101
I will open rowdy sheet on that Gopi.

548
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:27,557
I will close his chapter.

549
00:27:27,794 --> 00:27:28,638
Uh-oh.

550
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:32,757
What is your expression of Close up ad?
Take a look over there.

551
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:34,270
Uh-oh.

552
00:27:38,962 --> 00:27:41,167
You changed cards and said Rama-Sita game?

553
00:27:41,848 --> 00:27:45,038
Gopi, I thought I would beat you
and leave you.

554
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:47,737
This time if you are caught
I will shoot you.

555
00:27:47,817 --> 00:27:49,758
What can you do?

556
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,067
â™ªYou are the top in ego in both
E.G and W.G districts.â™ª

557
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,019
â™ªNo one can beat your style
in Andhra and Nizam.â™ª

558
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:24,320
â™ªO handsome, I got to know a little...â™ª

559
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,679
â™ªI get excited with the touch of yours.â™ª

560
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,258
â™ªHey, man. I am here to hunt you down.â™ª

561
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:36,739
â™ªI left my place and came here for you.â™ª

562
00:28:36,819 --> 00:28:40,170
â™ªThis guy will ask you to touch him.â™ª

563
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:43,975
â™ªBut if you touch his ego,
he will peel off your skin.â™ª

564
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:49,283
Hey constable!

565
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,343
Search whole Amalapuram.

566
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,878
At black bridge, red bridge,
high school road,...

567
00:28:57,245 --> 00:29:01,557
...don't leave any dhabas,
wine shops, anything.

568
00:29:01,817 --> 00:29:03,719
Arrest everyone.

569
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:22,834
â™ªI have glitters in my body.
I am a sweet from Mumbai.â™ª

570
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,645
â™ªHey, knife behind the silk shirt,
I liked your snob behaviour.â™ª

571
00:29:33,092 --> 00:29:36,179
â™ªSurround my waist like a betal leaf.â™ª

572
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:39,859
â™ªHold me like a iguanaâ™ª

573
00:29:39,939 --> 00:29:43,134
â™ªThe streets...
...are afraid of me.â™ª

574
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:48,583
â™ªHere and there I need to improve
my shakes with your sight.â™ª

575
00:29:48,663 --> 00:29:52,097
â™ªHey, man. I am here to hunt you down.â™ª

576
00:29:52,177 --> 00:29:55,515
â™ªI left my place and came here for you.â™ª

577
00:29:55,595 --> 00:29:59,083
â™ªThis guy will ask you to touch him.â™ª

578
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:02,888
â™ªBut if you touch his ego,
he will peel off your skin.â™ª

579
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,592
Oh.

580
00:30:28,392 --> 00:30:29,700
Sir.
What happened, man?

581
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:32,532
We are searching for Gopi, right?

582
00:30:32,612 --> 00:30:35,267
He is in the backyard
of our police station...

583
00:30:35,347 --> 00:30:37,583
...and brought some girls here, Sir.

584
00:30:37,663 --> 00:30:38,610
What?

585
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:41,529
We allotted him the station and roaming
the village like idiots, looking for him.

586
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:45,010
Just manage him for five minutes...

587
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,667
...I will shoot him on the spot.
Okay, Sir.

588
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:48,932
Move the vehicle, guys.

589
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:52,488
â™ªMy moves are fresh
I am a city sweet.â™ª

590
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:59,606
â™ªTake away everything
Come on, Bullet Raja.â™ª

591
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:09,652
â™ªLike a jin and rum,
use everything like a jio simâ™ª

592
00:31:09,732 --> 00:31:12,949
â™ªKiss me.
What is this disturbance?â™ª

593
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:18,428
â™ªOh moon like guy!
If we dance, the night will pass away.â™ª

594
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:21,910
â™ªHey, man. I am here to hunt you down.â™ª

595
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,401
â™ªI left my place and came here for you.â™ª

596
00:31:25,481 --> 00:31:28,873
â™ªThis guy will ask you to touch him.â™ª

597
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:33,138
â™ªBut if you touch his ego,
he will peel off your skin.â™ª

598
00:31:33,462 --> 00:31:34,349
Uh-oh.

599
00:31:34,705 --> 00:31:35,612
Where are they?

600
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:38,542
I asked you to manage him for 5 minutes
and you are dancing with them?

601
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:42,304
Sir, Gopi and his gang trapped me
and ran away.

602
00:31:42,384 --> 00:31:43,266
Who is she?

603
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:44,802
Arrested her in the fare yesterday, Sir.

604
00:31:44,882 --> 00:31:47,981
Why didn't you tell me?
You were busy with Bajjila Bujji.

605
00:31:48,061 --> 00:31:49,473
Is that personal matter needed now?

606
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,489
Where are you from?
Mumbai.

607
00:31:52,749 --> 00:31:55,625
Get this girl ready.

608
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:57,030
I will eat it to night.

609
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:59,900
If you taste it, I will lock-up you
and kill you.

610
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:01,576
Be careful and finish the work.

611
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:03,922
Get inside.

612
00:32:04,311 --> 00:32:05,911
Gopi...

613
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:09,272
I will hang you with this box.

614
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:13,067
What do you think of this
Aavugadda Apparao?

615
00:32:13,402 --> 00:32:16,278
I will break your legs with these drugs.

616
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:21,194
Hey 302,...
Sir.

617
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:22,740
Take this box...

618
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,361
...and put it in Gopi's bullet.

619
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:25,399
Okay, Sir.

620
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,805
Good idea.

621
00:32:27,021 --> 00:32:28,345
Hello TV9!
Tell me, Sir.

622
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:29,415
NTV.
Breaking news.

623
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:30,529
Sakshi.
One minute, Sir.

624
00:32:30,609 --> 00:32:31,729
TV5.
Yes, Sir.

625
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:32,896
Etv.
Coming right away, Sir.

626
00:32:32,976 --> 00:32:36,042
I am catching a drug smuggler in an hour.

627
00:32:36,122 --> 00:32:38,486
Come to the checkpost at the bridge.

628
00:32:45,661 --> 00:32:48,126
Have you seen his ego, Sir?

629
00:32:48,375 --> 00:32:49,660
Let him.

630
00:32:49,941 --> 00:32:52,957
Just after five minutes,
we will see how he hides his face.

631
00:32:53,037 --> 00:32:57,044
Minister, Collector, MLA, MLC,...

632
00:32:57,124 --> 00:32:59,120
...even if my wife comes,
don't leave anybody.

633
00:33:00,954 --> 00:33:02,046
Oh my God!

634
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,543
Why is she here?

635
00:33:04,623 --> 00:33:05,829
Hey, open it.

636
00:33:06,608 --> 00:33:09,029
Madam.
Hey!

637
00:33:09,289 --> 00:33:10,013
Sir.

638
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:11,697
Have you gone blind?

639
00:33:11,777 --> 00:33:12,843
Who do you think she is.

640
00:33:13,297 --> 00:33:14,378
She is my wife.

641
00:33:14,458 --> 00:33:15,729
Sir, you said by yourself.

642
00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:18,140
Not to leave anyone, even my wife.

643
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:20,464
Will say multiple things in flow.
Will you stop them?

644
00:33:20,544 --> 00:33:23,906
Dear press, have you seen
the social equality of the CI?

645
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:25,322
One law for his wife...

646
00:33:25,402 --> 00:33:27,333
...and another law for the public.
What do you say, Sir.

647
00:33:27,895 --> 00:33:29,203
Oh God!

648
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:31,245
I will see you soon.

649
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:34,100
I will prove my sincerity and your fraud.

650
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,948
Dear press, I don't have any differences.
I will check everyone.

651
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:40,273
My dear...

652
00:33:40,781 --> 00:33:43,838
...this is test for me. Please co-operate
and let them search.

653
00:33:44,065 --> 00:33:46,043
If not, I will get bad name that
listening to wife's words, rules were...

654
00:33:46,123 --> 00:33:48,216
...broken by Aavugadda Apparao...

655
00:33:48,296 --> 00:33:51,773
...they will scroll the news repeatedly
and get me suspended.

656
00:33:51,853 --> 00:33:54,212
Do I have to listen to you
in front of everyone?

657
00:33:55,077 --> 00:33:56,396
Please don't say like that.

658
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:58,580
After going home, you do as your wish.

659
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,148
Please save my dignity in public.

660
00:34:00,228 --> 00:34:02,158
Check madam's bike.

661
00:34:02,238 --> 00:34:04,225
Madam.
Duty.

662
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,847
Everyone can check. Zoom in the cameras.

663
00:34:08,885 --> 00:34:11,306
What is this, madam.
I am carrying drugs.

664
00:34:11,685 --> 00:34:15,317
Are you checking vehicle of CI Sir's wife?
Did you lose your mind?

665
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,284
Why are you over reacting?

666
00:34:17,364 --> 00:34:18,766
Sir, listen to me.
Hey!

667
00:34:18,846 --> 00:34:20,625
I don't listen to anyone when on duty.

668
00:34:20,705 --> 00:34:22,030
Shut up.

669
00:34:22,247 --> 00:34:25,058
You are just two days away from your
retirement. I am leaving you...

670
00:34:25,372 --> 00:34:26,864
...Give me the box.

671
00:34:28,053 --> 00:34:29,783
Close your mouth.
Eat it.

672
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,188
Everyone have it.

673
00:34:31,268 --> 00:34:32,723
Enjoy the sweets.

674
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:34,345
Press, check this carefully.

675
00:34:34,582 --> 00:34:35,490
Uh-oh.

676
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,939
Take photographs carefully.

677
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:37,771
Uh-oh.

678
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:41,631
I asked you to keep this in his vehicle.
Why did you put it here?

679
00:34:41,804 --> 00:34:46,573
I was going. But your wife saw me in the
middle, beat me and took that box, Sir.

680
00:34:46,653 --> 00:34:50,069
I was about to tell you that
but you asked me to shut up.

681
00:34:50,318 --> 00:34:52,134
You beat me on my dignity, idiot.

682
00:34:52,214 --> 00:34:53,378
Dear press,...

683
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:56,038
...if law protectors...

684
00:34:56,118 --> 00:34:57,832
...start doing smuggling...

685
00:34:58,265 --> 00:34:59,595
...whom can we report to?

686
00:34:59,675 --> 00:35:01,151
Sir, will you leave your wife now?

687
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:02,611
Or put her in jail?

688
00:35:02,691 --> 00:35:04,330
Is this the first time
that she is smuggling?

689
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:05,823
Are there any cases
already registered on her?

690
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:08,093
We are all waiting for your answer, Sir.

691
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:09,233
Please comment.

692
00:35:09,313 --> 00:35:11,395
Comment, Sir.
If I bend now, I will lose everything.

693
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:12,551
Never.

694
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,637
Everyone is equal before law. Come.

695
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:18,545
What are you looking at?
(Slaps)

696
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:21,205
Get on the jeep.

697
00:35:22,102 --> 00:35:23,226
Get on.

698
00:35:23,551 --> 00:35:25,270
Why did you beat her like that, Sir.

699
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:26,587
25 years of frustration.

700
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:30,573
(Music)

701
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:36,072
(Music)

702
00:35:36,152 --> 00:35:37,600
Please change the channel, guys.
I am frightened.

703
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,368
Every channel is showing the same thing.

704
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:48,179
You keep me inside the jail?

705
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:50,013
Sir, your wife at your home...

706
00:35:50,093 --> 00:35:52,373
...has been smuggling.
Didn't you ever doubt her?

707
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:55,324
What about the role of your
in-laws in this matter?

708
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,747
Are you trying to bring her out
using all your influence?

709
00:35:57,827 --> 00:35:59,942
Which cases are you filing on her, Sir?

710
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:02,061
Greetings, Press people.

711
00:36:02,472 --> 00:36:06,638
Do you know situation of a groundnut when
fried in it's oil? I'm in same situation.

712
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:09,131
If you leave me for some time, ...

713
00:36:09,211 --> 00:36:12,054
...I will interrogate the culprit...

714
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:13,935
...and will decide on my life.

715
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:15,849
Meanwhile there are some snacks outside.

716
00:36:16,173 --> 00:36:17,492
Go have them and relax.

717
00:36:17,572 --> 00:36:18,750
Hmm.

718
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:20,880
(Smiles)

719
00:36:22,761 --> 00:36:24,285
(Screams)

720
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,556
25 years frustration. Will it be normal?

721
00:36:27,326 --> 00:36:28,656
(Screams)

722
00:36:28,736 --> 00:36:30,688
He got a chance.

723
00:36:32,288 --> 00:36:36,234
Wow. Super.

724
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:37,488
He is coming.

725
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,248
Oh my.

726
00:36:41,096 --> 00:36:42,134
My God!

727
00:36:47,356 --> 00:36:50,833
Are you relieved from your
25 years of frustration?

728
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,173
Hey!

729
00:36:52,584 --> 00:36:54,465
Have you ever read 'Medipandu' poem?

730
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:58,433
(Screams)

731
00:36:58,513 --> 00:36:59,957
Please listen to me.

732
00:37:00,681 --> 00:37:02,573
You are beating me...

733
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:04,720
...please manage it with your screams.

734
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,222
Or else my dignity will be gone.

735
00:37:07,611 --> 00:37:10,022
Then watch now.

736
00:37:10,721 --> 00:37:12,273
(Screams)

737
00:37:12,353 --> 00:37:14,959
(Screams)

738
00:37:16,645 --> 00:37:17,445
(Music)

739
00:37:18,807 --> 00:37:21,779
(Fireworks)

740
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,709
(Drums beats)

741
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:27,552
So all the preparations are going well?

742
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:29,822
Yeah. They are being done very well, man.

743
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:32,706
Flexies all over the village...

744
00:37:32,786 --> 00:37:34,994
...books in school and prasad in temple...

745
00:37:35,074 --> 00:37:38,933
...and distributing milk and fruits in
hospitals and clothes in orphanage.

746
00:37:39,013 --> 00:37:40,998
What about blood donation camp?

747
00:37:41,247 --> 00:37:43,743
All the youth from every district
is here, man.

748
00:37:43,823 --> 00:37:47,646
Your name will resound in the two states
with this mega blood camp.

749
00:37:47,726 --> 00:37:50,305
You don't fear anything.
I will take care of everything.

750
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:51,624
Go ahead, guys.

751
00:37:51,704 --> 00:37:53,789
(Whistles)

752
00:37:56,838 --> 00:37:57,833
Hey, man.

753
00:37:57,913 --> 00:38:00,081
See the handsome Gopi there.

754
00:38:01,941 --> 00:38:05,595
Seeing my following, Chandrababu Naidu
might give me a ticket.

755
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:10,834
What is it, man?

756
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,276
Look there.

757
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:13,714
What is it?

758
00:38:15,054 --> 00:38:16,146
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO OUR INDÃ™S DOG, GOPI.

759
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:23,725
What is happening to my heart, man?

760
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:27,093
She drowned my dignity in Godavari.

761
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:29,666
(Fireworks)

762
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,071
Oh my God!

763
00:38:31,151 --> 00:38:33,471
So in the naming ceremony
she named her dog as Gopi?

764
00:38:33,551 --> 00:38:35,212
I am unable to think anything.

765
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,173
Take the vehicle to the school urgently.

766
00:38:39,768 --> 00:38:40,719
Hey!

767
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,882
Why didn't you distribute the books yet?

768
00:38:43,346 --> 00:38:44,514
All the books are here only?

769
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:47,273
How can we distribute?
Those kids are beating us like anything.

770
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:50,322
Indu is distributing tabs
on the eve of her dog's birthday.

771
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:52,430
Look.

772
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:54,851
Take it. Use it carefully.

773
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,246
Read well.

774
00:38:57,638 --> 00:38:58,774
Uh-oh.

775
00:38:58,854 --> 00:38:59,894
Hey, kids.

776
00:38:59,974 --> 00:39:00,968
Come here.

777
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,384
Take these books, children.

778
00:39:02,464 --> 00:39:04,644
Why do we take these books
when she is distributing tabs?

779
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:06,705
Hey.

780
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:12,662
(Drum beat)

781
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:16,366
Oh my!

782
00:39:16,446 --> 00:39:18,269
With the tabs distribution...

783
00:39:18,349 --> 00:39:20,835
...my dignity is completely lost, man.

784
00:39:22,846 --> 00:39:26,518
Come back, man.
Don't do it.

785
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,226
Please, man.
Stop it.

786
00:39:28,306 --> 00:39:29,956
Never heard of things happening here...

787
00:39:30,036 --> 00:39:32,561
...many came for blood camp here.
Don't worry. Just look there.

788
00:39:32,641 --> 00:39:33,978
There is great response here.

789
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:36,302
You are super.

790
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,617
Now, we can raise our shoulders.

791
00:39:38,697 --> 00:39:39,784
She will feel sad for this.

792
00:39:39,864 --> 00:39:42,308
No one has ever seen
such blood donation camp...

793
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:44,308
Thanks, man.

794
00:39:44,388 --> 00:39:47,534
The people are praising this camp here.

795
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:49,858
Also Ramya, in both the states...

796
00:39:49,938 --> 00:39:51,663
...to see this blood donation camp...

797
00:39:51,743 --> 00:39:53,771
...people are coming in groups.

798
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:56,896
Over to studio.
Why are you disturbing the live stream?

799
00:39:57,104 --> 00:40:00,013
You came for my birthday celebration and
how dare you to ask me leave?

800
00:40:00,093 --> 00:40:01,396
Who is he?

801
00:40:01,476 --> 00:40:03,548
I will kill this cameraman on live.

802
00:40:03,628 --> 00:40:05,277
What is it? Why do you ask me
to look somewhere else?

803
00:40:05,357 --> 00:40:06,996
Just look there, man.

804
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:12,619
I think I will die today itself,
with the shocks she is giving me.

805
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:13,797
(Laughs)

806
00:40:13,877 --> 00:40:15,235
He is dead by now.

807
00:40:15,315 --> 00:40:17,224
Why are my eyes going fuzzy?

808
00:40:17,304 --> 00:40:20,446
Something is happening inside.

809
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:22,330
Nowhere else in the world has happened.

810
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:24,281
Blood donation camp of the dogs...

811
00:40:24,361 --> 00:40:27,226
...by Indu of Amalapuram
is creating a lot of records.

812
00:40:27,306 --> 00:40:28,610
Blood is needed not only for humans...

813
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,253
...but is needed for dogs also.

814
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:33,388
She is showing her kind gesture
to the world through all this.

815
00:40:33,468 --> 00:40:36,026
Let's know the influence of this camp
from the villagers.

816
00:40:36,106 --> 00:40:38,573
What is your reaction on this
dog's blood donation camp?

817
00:40:38,653 --> 00:40:41,545
I am finding difficulty in breathing
and he is asking about reaction?

818
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:45,037
This is very great thing.

819
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:48,345
Great lady, like, Indu...

820
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:52,806
...is born here, and we are proud of it.

821
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,876
Our luck. Let me leave now.

822
00:40:56,384 --> 00:40:58,179
Uh-oh.

823
00:40:58,259 --> 00:40:59,444
(Laughs)

824
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:01,152
Look there, man.

825
00:41:01,404 --> 00:41:03,436
Heard of dogs tearing banana leaf...

826
00:41:03,516 --> 00:41:05,750
...tearing poster is yours, man.

827
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,426
(Cries)

828
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:10,528
Such great work by Indu...

829
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:12,318
is felicitated with 'Seva Bharathi'...

830
00:41:12,398 --> 00:41:15,161
...'Special Lady', 'Ideal woman' awards.

831
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:16,545
(Claps)

832
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:17,950
(Claps)

833
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:22,820
Gopi, seeing you she is over acting.

834
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,068
Either you should stay in this village
or I should.

835
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:26,344
Why would you stay?

836
00:41:26,424 --> 00:41:28,950
In the whole Amalapuram, Gopi is only one.

837
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:31,760
You have spoiled my life.

838
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,513
Yes, man. I have started already.
I will be in Hyderabad by morning.

839
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:38,092
Why do you stand here
even after scolding you?

840
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:40,816
I will see that you don't have
any address to stay.

841
00:41:40,896 --> 00:41:43,562
Sit on this lorry happily.

842
00:41:43,844 --> 00:41:45,660
You will reach somewhere.

843
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,800
Go, go. Good night.

844
00:41:48,233 --> 00:41:49,617
Right, right.

845
00:41:49,697 --> 00:41:52,773
Get lost, you dog.

846
00:41:53,487 --> 00:41:55,174
Do you understand what you are doing?

847
00:41:55,574 --> 00:41:58,493
You bought a puppy for three lakhs.

848
00:41:58,573 --> 00:42:00,406
You performed naming ceremony
and spent 1 million.

849
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:02,071
I thought it's a childish act.

850
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:05,740
But when you spent 2.5 million rupees
to celebrate it's birthday, I realised...

851
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,983
...that it's mental act.

852
00:42:07,063 --> 00:42:09,837
If you do such things,
who will marry you, dear?

853
00:42:09,917 --> 00:42:12,172
Wait, brother. What's wrong with our dear?

854
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:16,115
Everything is more for her. Like a queue
at ATM, they will stand in a line...

855
00:42:16,195 --> 00:42:18,093
...to marry her.
You stop.

856
00:42:18,904 --> 00:42:21,737
She is spoiled because of your pampering.
Brother-in-law...

857
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:23,023
...she is just a kid.

858
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,353
She is not a kid anymore.

859
00:42:24,904 --> 00:42:26,468
She is grown up, ready to get married.

860
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:30,019
Our Buramma is a kid, brother.
Why think of her marriage so early?

861
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:32,571
In her marriage issue...

862
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,886
...I already took a decision.

863
00:42:35,443 --> 00:42:36,465
(Music)

864
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:42,214
How will we stay if you leave Amalapuram?

865
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:45,047
You are just scaring me.

866
00:42:45,295 --> 00:42:47,479
Plan something to stop
these marriage looks.

867
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:48,279
Brother.

868
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:50,333
You have very good videos in your phone.

869
00:42:50,413 --> 00:42:51,593
What is the password of your phone?

870
00:42:51,673 --> 00:42:53,139
Buremma.

871
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:55,182
Bu...

872
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:57,863
...re...mma.

873
00:42:57,943 --> 00:42:59,182
Buremma.

874
00:42:59,262 --> 00:43:00,620
Oh, Buremma.

875
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:02,674
Password is too good, man.

876
00:43:02,754 --> 00:43:05,950
Do you know what is the breaking news
in all news channels?

877
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,955
What is it?

878
00:43:07,035 --> 00:43:08,631
The guys who came for marriage looks...

879
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:10,728
...loses their eyesight.

880
00:43:10,808 --> 00:43:12,598
(Laughs)

881
00:43:13,231 --> 00:43:14,247
(Laughs)

882
00:43:14,441 --> 00:43:16,085
Stop your extras.

883
00:43:16,165 --> 00:43:19,879
Hey, Gopi. Actually I was not interested
in marriage now.

884
00:43:20,204 --> 00:43:21,771
But now, I am telling you...

885
00:43:21,851 --> 00:43:23,311
...in just a week days,...

886
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:27,246
...I will marry a guy who is more handsome
and more rich compared to you.

887
00:43:27,326 --> 00:43:29,463
Do you know what would be
the breaking news then?

888
00:43:29,543 --> 00:43:32,544
Seeing IndÃ¹s marriage performed well,...

889
00:43:32,624 --> 00:43:35,392
...Gopi and his friends drown
themselves in Godavari.

890
00:43:35,472 --> 00:43:36,581
(Snapping fingers)

891
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:38,927
Let's go, girls.

892
00:43:39,208 --> 00:43:41,273
(Music)

893
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:42,906
(Music)

894
00:43:45,648 --> 00:43:46,783
(Cycle bell rings)

895
00:43:46,863 --> 00:43:48,685
Where is IndÃ¹s house, Sir?

896
00:43:49,118 --> 00:43:50,242
Hey, tell him.

897
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,394
Go straight.

898
00:43:52,621 --> 00:43:54,296
Take left. There will be a temple.

899
00:43:54,376 --> 00:43:55,799
Turn right now. Did you get it?
Yes, Sir.

900
00:43:56,044 --> 00:43:56,920
You may leave.

901
00:43:57,115 --> 00:43:58,628
Where is IndÃ¹s house?

902
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:00,790
Hey tell them.
Straight, left...

903
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:01,899
...temple, right.

904
00:44:01,979 --> 00:44:04,196
Where is IndÃ¹s house, Sir?
Indu house?

905
00:44:04,276 --> 00:44:06,348
Who are all these men?

906
00:44:06,428 --> 00:44:09,353
(Music)

907
00:44:09,433 --> 00:44:10,618
Brothers,...

908
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:14,240
'Seva Bharathi', 'Special Lady',
'Ideal woman' awards winner...

909
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,883
...can you guide me to IndÃ¹s house?

910
00:44:16,186 --> 00:44:17,282
By the way, who are you?

911
00:44:17,563 --> 00:44:18,752
Why do you need that address?

912
00:44:18,832 --> 00:44:20,471
Do you don't know about it?

913
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:23,217
Aiswarya Naidu's daughter,
Indu has declared 'Swayamvaram'.

914
00:44:23,297 --> 00:44:24,439
What?

915
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:28,373
As dowry, they are offering 100 acres land
and 500 million cash.

916
00:44:28,453 --> 00:44:29,990
If you didn't know about this,...

917
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:33,032
...I can understand what
a useless batch this is.

918
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:34,114
Excuse me.

919
00:44:34,194 --> 00:44:37,076
Where is 'Ideal Woman' house?
Where did you come from?

920
00:44:37,156 --> 00:44:39,751
America.
Oh my God! From America?

921
00:44:39,831 --> 00:44:42,238
Technology, brother. I saw a post in
Facebook about 'Swayamvaram'...

922
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:43,870
...caught a flight and landed here.

923
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:45,913
If you don't run away from
here immediately...

924
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:49,074
...I will run the car over you and
I will carry your dead body.

925
00:44:49,154 --> 00:44:51,550
(Slaps)
None of you gave me any information.

926
00:44:51,885 --> 00:44:54,372
Give me the matchbox.

927
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:56,556
Where is 'Seva Bharathi' IndÃ¹s house, Sir?

928
00:44:56,636 --> 00:44:58,922
Are you also going to 'Swayamvaram'?
No, Sir.

929
00:44:59,002 --> 00:45:02,501
My brother is giving water in the fields.
He asked me to stand in the line.

930
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:03,928
Oh, my.

931
00:45:04,008 --> 00:45:05,712
How will you half-ticket guy
watch the horror movie?

932
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,664
Go to school.
Get lost, full-ticket.

933
00:45:07,744 --> 00:45:09,167
Oh my God.

934
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,459
Even a boy is throwing punches at us.

935
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:13,281
'Seva Bharathi'

936
00:45:13,361 --> 00:45:16,345
(Screams)
Location change.

937
00:45:17,513 --> 00:45:19,102
She is acting too much.

938
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,219
In a day, one looks for one match,...

939
00:45:22,641 --> 00:45:24,349
...maximum they will look two matches.

940
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:25,722
But who are these...

941
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:30,316
...like the asthma patients coming for
fish medicine, they are just floating.

942
00:45:30,396 --> 00:45:31,722
What is this horn sound in the fields?

943
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:33,054
(Music)

944
00:45:34,632 --> 00:45:36,794
Stop, stop, man.

945
00:45:36,874 --> 00:45:39,281
'Seva Bharathi', 'Special Lady',
'Ideal woman' awards winner...

946
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,670
(Screams)
Location change.

947
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:42,642
Where are they?

948
00:45:44,369 --> 00:45:46,574
Excuse me. Where is 'Seva Bharathi'
IndÃ¹s house?

949
00:45:46,654 --> 00:45:48,196
Are you going like this
for marriage looks?

950
00:45:48,276 --> 00:45:50,589
Thought we will be late...

951
00:45:50,669 --> 00:45:51,984
...so we came swimming through canals.

952
00:45:52,064 --> 00:45:54,481
Let's get away from here.
Where are they?

953
00:45:59,004 --> 00:46:03,858
I never thought we will come
here in the day light.

954
00:46:04,279 --> 00:46:05,274
Uh-oh.

955
00:46:05,354 --> 00:46:06,625
My head is breaking.

956
00:46:06,705 --> 00:46:08,669
Excuse me.

957
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:10,982
'Special Lady', 'Ideal woman' ...

958
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:15,481
...'Seva Bharathi' awards winner,
Kumari IndÃ¹s house, where is it?

959
00:46:17,187 --> 00:46:18,679
Who are you all?

960
00:46:18,759 --> 00:46:20,409
We are the grooms.

961
00:46:20,489 --> 00:46:22,095
Shall we change the location, brother?

962
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,571
No shifting. Packup.

963
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:26,917
Have you finished your graduation?

964
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:28,160
What is it?

965
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,682
Is nobody selected since morning?

966
00:46:30,762 --> 00:46:31,925
However late it might be,...

967
00:46:32,304 --> 00:46:33,860
...we must get a correct groom for indu.

968
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:34,851
Peddoda...
Yes, brother.

969
00:46:34,931 --> 00:46:36,315
Make food arrangements for everyone.

970
00:46:36,395 --> 00:46:37,471
Sure, brother.

971
00:46:38,582 --> 00:46:39,447
What is your salary?

972
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,454
Brother-in-law...

973
00:46:56,622 --> 00:46:59,941
5000 dollars, this guy looks good.

974
00:47:00,021 --> 00:47:01,436
He is doctor in America.

975
00:47:01,516 --> 00:47:03,998
He is from Amalapuram
but settled in America.

976
00:47:04,078 --> 00:47:05,079
Brother...
Yes.

977
00:47:05,382 --> 00:47:08,452
It's a joint family. We are also
looking for such family, brother.

978
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:09,976
If you say okay we will
go ahead with marriage.

979
00:47:10,362 --> 00:47:12,719
Let's do it, dear.
Say okay, brother-in-law.

980
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:14,038
Say okay, dear.
Okay.

981
00:47:14,449 --> 00:47:16,790
If you all are willing
then we will go ahead.

982
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,514
Done.
Excuse me.

983
00:47:18,594 --> 00:47:19,573
One selfie, please.

984
00:47:19,653 --> 00:47:20,827
(Smiles)

985
00:47:22,012 --> 00:47:23,569
(Camera clicks)

986
00:47:24,617 --> 00:47:26,574
There are two more acres.
Will finish it today.

987
00:47:27,017 --> 00:47:29,352
Hey.
Yes, dad.

988
00:47:29,774 --> 00:47:31,612
What did you do with the one lakh rupees?

989
00:47:32,668 --> 00:47:35,079
'Take a DD for one lakh and come home.'

990
00:47:35,468 --> 00:47:36,927
'Give me that iPhone box.'

991
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:39,338
A friend of mine needed it.
(Slaps)

992
00:47:39,418 --> 00:47:43,287
Brother.
You just lie for everything.

993
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:49,709
Our enemy is celebrating America relation.
But we're losing dignity because of you.

994
00:47:49,789 --> 00:47:52,055
Brother-in-law, let's search an
American match for Gopi too.

995
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:55,769
Amalapuram girls are spitting on us...

996
00:47:56,148 --> 00:47:57,953
...and you are talking about
America match.

997
00:47:58,033 --> 00:47:59,413
In his life, will he...

998
00:48:00,051 --> 00:48:02,483
Lakshmi, my BP is rising.

999
00:48:02,563 --> 00:48:04,348
Ask him to leave from here.

1000
00:48:10,824 --> 00:48:13,483
How can you leave us like this?

1001
00:48:13,563 --> 00:48:15,725
How can we live without you?

1002
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:17,530
Hey, give me. Stop your nonsense.

1003
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,152
I am not going for my dad's scoldings.
Then?

1004
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:22,828
Indu has hit me on my ego.

1005
00:48:22,908 --> 00:48:27,407
I will set a beautiful girl in Hyderabad
in just a week...

1006
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,007
...and only then will I come
back to Amalapuram.

1007
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:32,142
I will see that she cries of jealousy.

1008
00:48:32,222 --> 00:48:33,494
Have patience till then.

1009
00:48:33,574 --> 00:48:34,891
Brother, let's go.

1010
00:48:35,183 --> 00:48:38,253
Take care. Check for our
Sankar and Nagababu.

1011
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:40,902
Okay, sure.

1012
00:48:40,982 --> 00:48:41,972
(Auto sound)

1013
00:48:57,772 --> 00:48:58,518
(Lighter sound)

1014
00:49:00,615 --> 00:49:02,215
(Phone dial)

1015
00:49:02,691 --> 00:49:04,874
(Phone rings)

1016
00:49:07,005 --> 00:49:08,767
Is it he?
Yes, it is.

1017
00:49:08,847 --> 00:49:10,573
Hey, Sankar. Answer the call, man.

1018
00:49:10,653 --> 00:49:13,243
What shall we do?
Let's not answer it.

1019
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:14,508
(Music)

1020
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:16,356
(Music)

1021
00:49:16,794 --> 00:49:17,853
Now you will get the call.

1022
00:49:18,448 --> 00:49:20,567
(Phone rings)

1023
00:49:21,161 --> 00:49:24,091
Hey, Nalla Babu. Answer the call, man.

1024
00:49:24,171 --> 00:49:26,707
What shall we do?
Let's not answer it.

1025
00:49:26,787 --> 00:49:29,016
You said you will come to recieve me.

1026
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:31,189
He used to play with us.

1027
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:32,778
That's the reason we are
playing with him now.

1028
00:49:32,858 --> 00:49:35,330
(Laughs)

1029
00:49:35,892 --> 00:49:36,821
(Music)

1030
00:49:36,901 --> 00:49:38,547
Now he will take five minutes break...

1031
00:49:39,217 --> 00:49:40,936
...walks for a while...

1032
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:43,109
...hits the tree ...

1033
00:49:43,585 --> 00:49:45,131
...smokes cigarettes...

1034
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:46,904
...drinks a tea,...

1035
00:49:47,671 --> 00:49:49,237
...and will call again.

1036
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:50,383
(Music)

1037
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:54,578
Didn't I tell you?

1038
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:55,843
(Phone dial)

1039
00:49:58,257 --> 00:49:58,928
(Phone dial)

1040
00:49:59,317 --> 00:50:00,290
(Shocked)

1041
00:50:01,382 --> 00:50:03,392
You idiots!

1042
00:50:03,587 --> 00:50:06,690
You are online and acting in Oscar level!

1043
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,365
(Camera clicks)

1044
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:11,562
Wow! Super.
Will you upload on FB as 'Beautiful girl'?

1045
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:13,984
I took them for that only.

1046
00:50:18,611 --> 00:50:21,676
Who is this girl online?

1047
00:50:22,855 --> 00:50:24,757
Wow! She is beautiful.

1048
00:50:24,837 --> 00:50:26,584
She is like a cute sweet.

1049
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,697
Hi, hi, hi.

1050
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,724
I know about you.

1051
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:36,093
I need to talk to you.

1052
00:50:36,807 --> 00:50:39,272
Talk to me? You remove this.

1053
00:50:40,288 --> 00:50:41,974
A girl wants to talk to me?

1054
00:50:42,223 --> 00:50:46,286
I am new in the house
in the end of the street.

1055
00:50:46,366 --> 00:50:49,281
I observe you daily.
Is it?

1056
00:50:49,361 --> 00:50:52,502
I took your number from the laundry man
opposite to your house.

1057
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,478
Is it? I love you, my dear, laundry man.
Treat for you to night.

1058
00:50:55,558 --> 00:50:57,175
Let's meet urgently.

1059
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,288
Now?

1060
00:50:58,368 --> 00:51:01,240
Since it is morning,
we both will be fresh.

1061
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,305
Okay. Come fast.

1062
00:51:03,385 --> 00:51:05,060
I will be late to office.

1063
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,098
She is more hurried than me.
Where shall we meet?

1064
00:51:08,314 --> 00:51:09,147
Hmm.

1065
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:14,520
I am at Maithrivanam. Come in an hour.

1066
00:51:14,779 --> 00:51:15,664
Why one hour?

1067
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:17,880
Come, you ***. You are done in my hands.

1068
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:18,983
(Music)

1069
00:51:19,653 --> 00:51:21,686
'I never dreamed of this in my life.'

1070
00:51:22,064 --> 00:51:24,994
I will find some resort and relax myself.

1071
00:51:25,815 --> 00:51:26,648
(Music)

1072
00:51:27,724 --> 00:51:29,854
(Phone dials)

1073
00:51:29,934 --> 00:51:31,638
Should not waste any time.

1074
00:51:32,211 --> 00:51:33,930
(Phone rings)

1075
00:51:34,805 --> 00:51:37,325
This is my number.

1076
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:41,098
You are here?
Where is the room?

1077
00:51:41,178 --> 00:51:42,046
(Door knocks)

1078
00:51:42,126 --> 00:51:44,002
Who is it so early?

1079
00:51:44,082 --> 00:51:45,127
(Screams)

1080
00:51:45,527 --> 00:51:47,191
Brother, what is the mark on your cheek?

1081
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:49,995
(Smiles)

1082
00:51:50,287 --> 00:51:51,898
You will also get one.

1083
00:51:53,098 --> 00:51:54,158
(Screams)

1084
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:56,525
My cheek is aching.
Do you think I am happy with it?

1085
00:51:56,605 --> 00:51:57,931
Hey!

1086
00:51:58,011 --> 00:51:59,830
Where are you going?

1087
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,290
I will walk in the front.

1088
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:03,928
Are you eating food or ego?

1089
00:52:04,008 --> 00:52:05,376
Do you know about his ego range?

1090
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:07,117
If there's ego competition in Olympics,...

1091
00:52:07,197 --> 00:52:09,636
...he will bring us a gold medal.

1092
00:52:09,716 --> 00:52:13,325
Anyone will bet on becoming
a doctor or a collector...

1093
00:52:13,405 --> 00:52:16,027
...and you bet that you will find
a girlfriend and take her to Amalapuram?

1094
00:52:16,107 --> 00:52:18,434
If you don't shut up,
I will bring that black lady...

1095
00:52:18,514 --> 00:52:21,065
...and make her give you lip kiss.

1096
00:52:21,145 --> 00:52:22,211
Excuse me.

1097
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:23,808
Yes.
Are you single?

1098
00:52:24,252 --> 00:52:26,716
Yes.
You don't have any boy friends?

1099
00:52:26,796 --> 00:52:27,808
No, I don't have.

1100
00:52:27,888 --> 00:52:29,300
So is your post empty?

1101
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,306
Yes, of course.

1102
00:52:30,386 --> 00:52:32,814
Can I apply to it?

1103
00:52:32,894 --> 00:52:33,878
Uh-oh.

1104
00:52:33,958 --> 00:52:35,197
Brother, did you see?

1105
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,715
He is opening the store.
Yeah. Full of business.

1106
00:52:38,494 --> 00:52:40,029
What is your opinion on love?

1107
00:52:40,109 --> 00:52:42,786
Previously, I used to propose everyone.

1108
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:44,656
Now, everyone is proposing me.

1109
00:52:44,736 --> 00:52:47,887
What is the difference, then and now?
Just a small surgery.

1110
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:50,654
Oh, to your beauty?
No. Gender change.

1111
00:52:51,292 --> 00:52:53,714
So are you two in one?

1112
00:52:53,794 --> 00:52:55,659
No, buy one, get one.

1113
00:52:55,876 --> 00:52:59,649
Hey, let's run.
What happened?

1114
00:52:59,729 --> 00:53:01,454
Oh my God! What a place is this!

1115
00:53:01,534 --> 00:53:02,859
There is no much difference
between male and female.

1116
00:53:02,939 --> 00:53:04,232
Breakup for you and me.

1117
00:53:04,312 --> 00:53:07,060
Did you hear some breakup here?
Yeah, it is.

1118
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:10,097
I will go and console her.

1119
00:53:10,177 --> 00:53:12,573
Don't call me again.

1120
00:53:12,653 --> 00:53:15,470
When you loved me and
got ready to marry someone else...

1121
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,727
...our love packup.

1122
00:53:17,807 --> 00:53:21,727
Every minute one girl in Hyderabad is
breaking up with her boy friend...

1123
00:53:21,807 --> 00:53:23,100
...puts back her make up...

1124
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:24,473
...hangs tolet board...

1125
00:53:24,754 --> 00:53:26,235
...and in search of true love...

1126
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:28,792
...they keep roaming in shopping malls.

1127
00:53:29,181 --> 00:53:30,608
Get lost.

1128
00:53:32,424 --> 00:53:33,332
Break up?

1129
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:35,808
You?
TO-LET.

1130
00:53:35,993 --> 00:53:36,729
(Music)

1131
00:53:36,809 --> 00:53:37,583
(Music)

1132
00:53:38,858 --> 00:53:39,766
Tolet?

1133
00:53:39,846 --> 00:53:41,485
(Laughs)

1134
00:53:48,488 --> 00:53:50,466
(Music)

1135
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:56,315
Gopi.

1136
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:57,842
Snoopy.

1137
00:53:58,264 --> 00:53:59,572
Is it your dog's name?

1138
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:02,004
No, it's my pet name.

1139
00:54:04,988 --> 00:54:06,848
It's difficult to stay here for long time.

1140
00:54:07,334 --> 00:54:08,877
If it is in pub, it's our wish.

1141
00:54:09,558 --> 00:54:12,434
(Music)

1142
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:14,758
(Music)

1143
00:54:16,661 --> 00:54:17,699
Two beers, please.

1144
00:54:18,423 --> 00:54:19,925
Excuse me.

1145
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:21,125
Any offer?

1146
00:54:21,352 --> 00:54:22,390
Get lost.

1147
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,346
We will pay the bill.

1148
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,519
Will you pay the bill?
Come on, doll.

1149
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:27,514
Let's dance.

1150
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:35,038
Oh, no.

1151
00:54:35,118 --> 00:54:36,995
All drink gone waste, man.

1152
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:38,984
No problem. Sorry, brother.

1153
00:54:39,064 --> 00:54:40,379
Hey, brother.

1154
00:54:40,689 --> 00:54:44,137
You came, hit me and said sorry.

1155
00:54:44,217 --> 00:54:46,213
What about my feelings, man?

1156
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:48,375
Where will I keep them, brother?

1157
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:50,905
Even sorry in this city is not
resolving anything.

1158
00:54:51,825 --> 00:54:53,414
Sorry for saying sorry, brother.

1159
00:54:53,494 --> 00:54:55,749
Sorry cancelled.

1160
00:55:09,665 --> 00:55:10,422
Uh-oh.

1161
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,191
Your head broke.

1162
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:26,819
Hey, who said laziness is a bad habit?

1163
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:29,392
The same bad habit brought be good.

1164
00:55:29,652 --> 00:55:31,436
Sometimes, bad is also good.

1165
00:55:31,516 --> 00:55:33,824
What do you say, guys?

1166
00:55:34,192 --> 00:55:35,986
You will not understand
unless you are hurt.

1167
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:40,300
(Screams)

1168
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:48,627
Hey!

1169
00:55:48,952 --> 00:55:51,514
I hit his shoulder, dropped my drink...

1170
00:55:51,594 --> 00:55:53,903
...lost a pink note but still
I didn't feel bad about it.

1171
00:55:53,983 --> 00:55:58,805
I took another pink note, bought a
new glass and enjoying myself.

1172
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:00,156
Why are you guys...

1173
00:56:00,236 --> 00:56:02,372
...irritating me like that?

1174
00:56:02,452 --> 00:56:04,610
Hey, Gopi here...

1175
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:05,722
...from Amalapuram...

1176
00:56:05,802 --> 00:56:07,084
...will peel off your skin.

1177
00:56:07,981 --> 00:56:09,300
Uh-oh.

1178
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,322
What you are doing is a bad one...

1179
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:14,457
...why don't you do it carefully?

1180
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:18,429
Hey! Show this villager our city power.

1181
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:30,028
One who is strong headed
will beat you strongly.

1182
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,855
But one with ego will
throw you and beat you.

1183
00:56:34,503 --> 00:56:35,426
Wait.

1184
00:56:35,506 --> 00:56:38,821
All this nonsense is because of you.

1185
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:43,329
Madhu, you spoiled the whole plan.

1186
00:56:43,409 --> 00:56:46,192
If you were patient for one more day,
I would have stollen his property...

1187
00:56:46,272 --> 00:56:48,236
...and would have gone to America.

1188
00:56:48,316 --> 00:56:51,792
Why are you supporting him, instead of me?

1189
00:56:51,872 --> 00:56:54,225
She is my lover.

1190
00:56:54,305 --> 00:56:56,074
What? Is he telling the truth?

1191
00:56:56,154 --> 00:56:57,151
Yes.

1192
00:56:57,231 --> 00:56:59,659
Then, what about my love?

1193
00:56:59,739 --> 00:57:02,556
So, in the mobile...
Just like you, fake call.

1194
00:57:02,636 --> 00:57:03,486
(Music)

1195
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:07,648
How do you know that mine is a fake call?
There are jammers in mall, you fool.

1196
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:10,463
(Music)

1197
00:57:10,993 --> 00:57:13,934
Any number of fulls are less
for the shock she gave me.

1198
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:15,724
Let's go.

1199
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:17,912
Excellent.

1200
00:57:18,297 --> 00:57:19,886
Brother, this bar is full.

1201
00:57:19,966 --> 00:57:21,291
Let's go to another one.

1202
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:23,378
Wait for a while.

1203
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,162
What will he do in one minute?

1204
00:57:26,016 --> 00:57:26,816
Hey, fool.

1205
00:57:26,896 --> 00:57:30,207
I don't know where are you but your lover
is sitting with someone else in this bar.

1206
00:57:30,287 --> 00:57:31,504
(Music)

1207
00:57:31,584 --> 00:57:33,493
Have you seen how many girls
ran away with just one call?

1208
00:57:33,573 --> 00:57:34,563
(Laughs)

1209
00:57:34,643 --> 00:57:36,282
Idiot.

1210
00:57:36,362 --> 00:57:37,353
I love you.

1211
00:57:38,077 --> 00:57:39,824
Eat it.
Hey, brother.

1212
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:41,694
One beer is 800 rupees here.

1213
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:43,013
Is it?

1214
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:46,192
Don't worry. He is from Amalapuram.

1215
00:57:46,272 --> 00:57:47,435
You are drowning my dignity.

1216
00:57:47,515 --> 00:57:50,458
With that 800, one man can get two beers.

1217
00:57:50,538 --> 00:57:52,977
Also two chicken leg pieces with it.
This is Hyderabad.

1218
00:57:53,057 --> 00:57:54,977
We are not in kaka hotel, but in Novotel.

1219
00:57:55,057 --> 00:57:56,026
My dear bearer.

1220
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:57,421
Sir, order please.

1221
00:57:57,501 --> 00:58:00,307
Get three cheap liquor bottles.

1222
00:58:00,387 --> 00:58:02,488
Please sit. Amalapuram.

1223
00:58:02,568 --> 00:58:04,484
Please sit down.

1224
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:06,239
Ramulamma, sit down.

1225
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:07,688
Sir, what about the order?
You wait.

1226
00:58:07,768 --> 00:58:10,920
If we bring cheap liquor to Novotel,
this happens. Costly foreign brand...

1227
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,395
...five fulls, then,...
Okay, Sir.

1228
00:58:13,475 --> 00:58:18,239
South and North Indian, Chinese, Korean,
Japanese, American, Thailand together...

1229
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:19,666
...bring everything.

1230
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,367
Go.

1231
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:29,840
(Music)

1232
00:58:30,175 --> 00:58:31,306
(Music)

1233
00:58:31,386 --> 00:58:32,900
(Music)

1234
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:35,775
We'll close restaurant in five minutes.
Tell me if you need anything else, Sir.

1235
00:58:36,608 --> 00:58:37,483
(Music)

1236
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:42,045
Raja Rao's wife eloped with Chinna Rao.

1237
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:43,428
Why are you telling me about it, Sir?

1238
00:58:43,508 --> 00:58:45,201
You asked me to tell something, right?

1239
00:58:45,569 --> 00:58:47,835
Shall I get the bill?
Of course.

1240
00:58:47,915 --> 00:58:49,089
This is the bill, Sir.

1241
00:58:49,169 --> 00:58:52,949
Is it done?

1242
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,371
Bill is 28,000, it seems.

1243
00:58:56,673 --> 00:58:58,500
Amalapuram.
Why are they standing?

1244
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:01,138
Sit down.
Will you pay by card or cash, Sir?

1245
00:59:01,613 --> 00:59:02,738
Oh.

1246
00:59:02,986 --> 00:59:04,262
I didn't get it.

1247
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:05,732
Then pay us by cash, Sir.

1248
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:09,996
Cash... When did we see the cash?

1249
00:59:10,991 --> 00:59:12,159
Manager Sir.

1250
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:13,629
What is the problem?

1251
00:59:13,709 --> 00:59:15,413
They drank to their full.

1252
00:59:15,493 --> 00:59:17,175
When I asked for bill,
they are empty handed, Sir.

1253
00:59:17,255 --> 00:59:19,572
What were you doing when
they were drinking?

1254
00:59:19,842 --> 00:59:21,270
I was supplying them, Sir.

1255
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:24,978
Call control room. Push them inside
and push him outside.

1256
00:59:25,058 --> 00:59:26,221
Sir, Sir.

1257
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:28,946
This is unfair, Sir.

1258
00:59:29,026 --> 00:59:30,103
Hello, control room.

1259
00:59:34,817 --> 00:59:35,584
Greetings, Sir.

1260
00:59:35,664 --> 00:59:39,118
Hey, did you think that this is some
cool water supply place in summer?

1261
00:59:39,198 --> 00:59:42,011
You drank so much.
I will take you to the station...

1262
00:59:42,091 --> 00:59:45,312
...I will beat you there where if beaten,
you will vomit everything.

1263
00:59:45,392 --> 00:59:47,172
Constables, bring them to station.

1264
00:59:47,647 --> 00:59:49,792
Go slow please.

1265
00:59:49,872 --> 00:59:51,759
You idiots.

1266
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,170
You don't have a rupee...

1267
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:56,678
...but go to a five star hotel?

1268
00:59:57,489 --> 01:00:00,211
They will beat us after going to station.

1269
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:02,308
What will happen to Gopi's dignity, man?

1270
01:00:02,388 --> 01:00:08,005
Everyone in the village will read about
my dignity loss in TV and paper.

1271
01:00:08,254 --> 01:00:10,578
You black idiots.

1272
01:00:10,658 --> 01:00:11,758
Hey, brother,...

1273
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:14,093
...the boy is worried,
please stop the vehicle.

1274
01:00:14,395 --> 01:00:15,509
(Jeep stops)

1275
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:19,531
This is my 500. This is my 500.

1276
01:00:20,006 --> 01:00:21,248
Sankar...

1277
01:00:21,328 --> 01:00:22,307
Chandra...

1278
01:00:22,387 --> 01:00:25,010
...what is this 1000 rupees?
In a five star hotel,...

1279
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:27,125
...your bill was 28,000 rupees.

1280
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:30,258
Even 10% gives my share to 2800.

1281
01:00:30,702 --> 01:00:34,563
Satyanarayana, you're irritating us a lot.
From tomorrow, we'll drink on our terrace.

1282
01:00:34,643 --> 01:00:36,704
Sankar, Chandra...

1283
01:00:36,898 --> 01:00:38,797
...should we not live? My wife, man...

1284
01:00:38,877 --> 01:00:41,871
...she is 9th month pregnant.
Who will give me the expenses?

1285
01:00:41,951 --> 01:00:42,871
I should also develop, right?

1286
01:00:42,951 --> 01:00:46,157
Don't worry, Satyanarayana. We will drink
full bottle in a five star hotel only.

1287
01:00:46,237 --> 01:00:47,952
Sure?
Yes.

1288
01:00:49,898 --> 01:00:52,449
Not even a girl is seen anywhere today.

1289
01:00:53,946 --> 01:00:55,881
Oh, girls.

1290
01:00:56,097 --> 01:00:58,000
None is good looking.

1291
01:01:00,378 --> 01:01:01,513
Not even these.

1292
01:01:07,218 --> 01:01:09,877
Super girl.

1293
01:01:10,429 --> 01:01:11,985
I am coming.

1294
01:01:14,346 --> 01:01:18,173
(Music)

1295
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,773
Why is she leaving?

1296
01:01:27,788 --> 01:01:28,728
(Calling with low sound)

1297
01:01:30,577 --> 01:01:32,307
Why is she leaving?

1298
01:01:54,623 --> 01:01:55,466
Oh.

1299
01:01:56,283 --> 01:01:57,213
You.

1300
01:02:01,570 --> 01:02:02,986
Excuse me, Sir.

1301
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:04,348
This is only for ladies.

1302
01:02:04,428 --> 01:02:07,533
Then, what about gents.
Vaseline is there, Sir.

1303
01:02:07,613 --> 01:02:09,252
Then why are you standing here?
Go and bring it.

1304
01:02:10,204 --> 01:02:11,306
(Music)

1305
01:02:13,937 --> 01:02:15,245
Oh my God!

1306
01:02:20,888 --> 01:02:23,180
Hyderabad tea is super, man.

1307
01:02:23,591 --> 01:02:25,208
Who is this guy?

1308
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:29,360
Wow.

1309
01:02:45,201 --> 01:02:48,180
You idiots didn't wake me up.

1310
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:50,386
I am late by an hour.

1311
01:02:50,699 --> 01:02:52,937
She must have returned to home.
Who is it?

1312
01:02:53,251 --> 01:02:54,418
New girl, man.

1313
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:58,176
She would have fallen
if I concentrated for today.

1314
01:02:58,425 --> 01:02:59,441
I missed her.

1315
01:02:59,521 --> 01:03:01,203
Don't beat us like that.

1316
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:04,604
Why didn't this alarm ring?
Thought it's disturbing, so turned it off.

1317
01:03:04,684 --> 01:03:05,527
Hey!

1318
01:03:05,607 --> 01:03:09,233
(Slaps)
Stop, man. It's hurting.

1319
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:11,255
I may lose the challenge.

1320
01:03:11,335 --> 01:03:13,860
God knows about his challenge
but he is hurting us a lot.

1321
01:03:14,282 --> 01:03:15,871
What shall we do now?
Keep quiet and sleep.

1322
01:03:15,951 --> 01:03:16,931
Okay.
Come.

1323
01:03:22,011 --> 01:03:23,633
Hey.
Oh God!

1324
01:03:23,713 --> 01:03:25,752
(Screams)

1325
01:03:25,936 --> 01:03:28,714
Why are you singing poems?
Did you swallow cigarette?

1326
01:03:28,794 --> 01:03:30,196
The girl, man.
Girl?

1327
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,526
Hi.
Hi.

1328
01:03:33,606 --> 01:03:35,223
Come, come.
Where?

1329
01:03:36,769 --> 01:03:38,376
Coming, coming.

1330
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:42,570
She is high class, man.

1331
01:03:42,916 --> 01:03:45,814
My room address...?
Followed you yesterday night.

1332
01:03:45,894 --> 01:03:47,089
Oh.

1333
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:48,516
You should have told me yesterday itself.

1334
01:03:48,596 --> 01:03:51,719
Then, I didn't know if it was
right or wrong.

1335
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:55,200
What did you like in me?
Your hurriedness.

1336
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,573
I am always like this.

1337
01:03:56,973 --> 01:03:58,184
Truly, I am very lucky.

1338
01:03:58,552 --> 01:04:00,895
Yeah.

1339
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:03,295
How long?

1340
01:04:03,375 --> 01:04:04,506
Until no one can reach us.

1341
01:04:06,408 --> 01:04:07,468
If we are caught?

1342
01:04:07,548 --> 01:04:08,971
We all will die.

1343
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:11,098
Who is that strong?

1344
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:13,887
My husband in the car beside.
Husband?

1345
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:17,238
Hey, stop it.

1346
01:04:18,406 --> 01:04:20,730
Stop it. Stop the car.

1347
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:23,714
Are you married?
It's been a month.

1348
01:04:24,395 --> 01:04:25,605
You eloped with a married lady?

1349
01:04:25,685 --> 01:04:27,605
Stop, man.

1350
01:04:27,685 --> 01:04:30,287
Stop it, man. I will kill you.

1351
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:34,011
You don't have your anklets when jogging
and no chain in shopping?

1352
01:04:34,091 --> 01:04:36,660
My husband doesn't love me.
I don't have interest in you.

1353
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:40,011
Hey, stop it.

1354
01:04:40,091 --> 01:04:41,341
Oh my!

1355
01:04:43,211 --> 01:04:44,379
Hey, police jeep.

1356
01:04:44,459 --> 01:04:45,774
Your husband already complained?

1357
01:04:45,948 --> 01:04:48,489
My husband will not file complaint.
Is he last in studies?

1358
01:04:48,569 --> 01:04:51,232
No, he is encounter specialist.

1359
01:04:52,486 --> 01:04:55,070
Hey, I will encounter you.

1360
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:58,140
We would have drunk costly brands
in five star hotels everyday.

1361
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:00,951
From tomorrow you will make us
drink what, man?

1362
01:05:01,031 --> 01:05:03,184
How will I know that
she will give this twist?

1363
01:05:05,779 --> 01:05:08,470
A married woman is like a sister to me.
Even for us.

1364
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:11,076
If someone gets to know that
I have done this dirty work...

1365
01:05:11,156 --> 01:05:12,265
...society will spit on me.

1366
01:05:12,693 --> 01:05:13,579
Please.

1367
01:05:13,817 --> 01:05:15,557
I don't have anything to do
with the society.

1368
01:05:15,637 --> 01:05:18,801
Will you take us to Arya Samaj
and trap us?

1369
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:21,125
She is my wife, man.

1370
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:25,467
Stop the car, please.

1371
01:05:25,547 --> 01:05:28,115
Hey, stop it, man.

1372
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:30,721
There will be a rod here.
If we pull it, it will stop.

1373
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:32,834
Hey, it's not gear, man.

1374
01:05:32,914 --> 01:05:35,887
Hey.
Oh.

1375
01:05:35,967 --> 01:05:37,531
(Car sounds)

1376
01:05:41,249 --> 01:05:43,066
Where are you going?

1377
01:05:45,505 --> 01:05:47,137
What's all this?

1378
01:05:47,217 --> 01:05:48,683
Hmm.

1379
01:05:49,829 --> 01:05:50,996
You.

1380
01:05:52,207 --> 01:05:54,239
You are eloping my wife?

1381
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:57,050
Please don't delay, Sir. Shoot me.

1382
01:05:57,363 --> 01:06:00,747
Then if I tell you the truth,
you can't bear it.

1383
01:06:00,827 --> 01:06:01,979
What is that truth?

1384
01:06:02,498 --> 01:06:03,623
You are doing a mistake, Sir.

1385
01:06:03,703 --> 01:06:05,820
Who has done that mistake? You or me?
You, Sir.

1386
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,226
It was you completely.

1387
01:06:07,409 --> 01:06:10,199
Every minute you think of people's good.

1388
01:06:10,279 --> 01:06:14,318
But you never thought why your wife
is eloping just after a month of marriage.

1389
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:16,833
Why will she elope?

1390
01:06:16,913 --> 01:06:19,265
Her husband is a powerful police officer.

1391
01:06:19,345 --> 01:06:20,487
She has a palace like building.

1392
01:06:20,567 --> 01:06:22,746
She has all the facilities.

1393
01:06:22,826 --> 01:06:25,114
I bought lands everywhere.

1394
01:06:25,194 --> 01:06:27,966
What else should I do?
You are a powerful officer, Sir.

1395
01:06:28,247 --> 01:06:30,496
But you have to use it at home also.

1396
01:06:30,576 --> 01:06:31,890
You gave a big house.

1397
01:06:32,550 --> 01:06:34,658
But you couldn't give her a little love.

1398
01:06:34,738 --> 01:06:36,348
Leave, man. He is talking there.

1399
01:06:36,428 --> 01:06:38,265
You feel like hi-fi facilities.

1400
01:06:38,345 --> 01:06:40,438
She is not getting any feeling with those.

1401
01:06:40,518 --> 01:06:42,892
She is so uncomfortable with that.

1402
01:06:43,843 --> 01:06:45,623
You have lands all over the city.

1403
01:06:45,937 --> 01:06:47,256
But you don't have place in her heart.

1404
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:49,050
Last but not the least, Sir.

1405
01:06:49,461 --> 01:06:51,677
You don't have time to love your wife...

1406
01:06:52,131 --> 01:06:54,304
...and she don't have patience
to bear the husband.

1407
01:06:54,384 --> 01:06:55,320
Enough of it, man.

1408
01:06:55,715 --> 01:06:57,607
Don't harass me with your words.

1409
01:06:58,050 --> 01:07:00,374
All these days I have been thinking that
I gave her everything.

1410
01:07:00,454 --> 01:07:01,780
But now I realised that ...

1411
01:07:03,931 --> 01:07:05,218
...I didn't give her what is required.

1412
01:07:05,975 --> 01:07:07,337
What did he mean, man?

1413
01:07:07,834 --> 01:07:08,749
Love, man.

1414
01:07:08,829 --> 01:07:09,765
Oh, love.

1415
01:07:09,845 --> 01:07:11,034
I thought something else.

1416
01:07:11,326 --> 01:07:13,575
From now on, I will do OT at home.

1417
01:07:14,148 --> 01:07:16,264
I will do duty only if I have time.

1418
01:07:16,729 --> 01:07:18,524
Brother, give me a 1000 rupees.

1419
01:07:19,388 --> 01:07:20,448
(Music)

1420
01:07:28,176 --> 01:07:29,063
(Camera clicks)

1421
01:07:30,392 --> 01:07:33,668
Sorry, I took selfie,
without your permission.

1422
01:07:33,748 --> 01:07:36,352
These days, goodness is vanishing.

1423
01:07:36,432 --> 01:07:39,697
If anyone does a good deed,
I take their pic and ...

1424
01:07:39,777 --> 01:07:41,134
...I keep it with me as a memory.

1425
01:07:41,214 --> 01:07:42,724
This is my hobby.

1426
01:07:42,804 --> 01:07:45,160
Oh, I didn't know such hobbies also exist.

1427
01:07:45,819 --> 01:07:48,035
This boy asked many of them for money.

1428
01:07:48,673 --> 01:07:50,144
But you are the only one who gave him.

1429
01:07:50,619 --> 01:07:53,787
You didn't even ask him the reason.

1430
01:07:54,258 --> 01:07:56,517
You have a great heart.

1431
01:07:56,863 --> 01:07:57,588
Okay.

1432
01:07:57,668 --> 01:08:00,107
Okay, thanks. It's really nice
meeting you.

1433
01:08:00,187 --> 01:08:01,069
Bye.

1434
01:08:03,296 --> 01:08:04,290
Hey!

1435
01:08:04,811 --> 01:08:06,811
Hello.

1436
01:08:06,891 --> 01:08:08,952
What is it?
Give me your mobile number.

1437
01:08:09,032 --> 01:08:12,703
Sorry, I don't maintain relations
with unknown people.

1438
01:08:12,783 --> 01:08:13,881
Hey.

1439
01:08:14,357 --> 01:08:16,645
Atleast send me the selfie, please.

1440
01:08:16,872 --> 01:08:17,932
Uh-oh.

1441
01:08:18,012 --> 01:08:19,889
Give me your number.

1442
01:08:21,218 --> 01:08:22,343
9533...

1443
01:08:22,423 --> 01:08:23,835
(Phone dial)

1444
01:08:23,915 --> 01:08:25,121
590...

1445
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:26,743
390.

1446
01:08:26,948 --> 01:08:29,078
Gopi, Amalapuram. You can save it.

1447
01:08:29,158 --> 01:08:30,040
Gopi.

1448
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:32,603
GOODBOY.
9533590390.

1449
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:33,857
Good boy.

1450
01:08:34,743 --> 01:08:36,105
I will send it. Thank you.

1451
01:08:36,185 --> 01:08:37,942
Send me. I will check.
Sure.

1452
01:08:39,412 --> 01:08:41,423
In city also, there are few good girls.

1453
01:08:47,268 --> 01:08:49,570
Why are you looking at her as
if you are seeing at Sunny Leone?

1454
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:51,051
Brother...

1455
01:08:51,635 --> 01:08:52,727
Uh-oh.

1456
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,257
When did you get this beautiful girl?

1457
01:08:55,337 --> 01:08:58,593
You are very talented, man.

1458
01:08:58,673 --> 01:08:59,826
Give it to me once.

1459
01:09:00,290 --> 01:09:02,636
Now Indu and gang...

1460
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:06,777
...should die of Gopi's bravery.

1461
01:09:07,621 --> 01:09:09,416
What did you do?

1462
01:09:09,610 --> 01:09:12,756
I sent your selfie pic with your darling
to that Kattappa.

1463
01:09:12,836 --> 01:09:14,983
Very good, man.
What have you done, man.

1464
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:16,302
Oh my God!

1465
01:09:16,670 --> 01:09:19,244
You brought down my character completely.

1466
01:09:19,324 --> 01:09:21,579
She is not my lover.

1467
01:09:21,659 --> 01:09:24,163
Why did you both take selfies then?

1468
01:09:24,725 --> 01:09:26,109
Think whatever you want.

1469
01:09:26,411 --> 01:09:27,482
Hey.

1470
01:09:28,033 --> 01:09:30,436
Who is this guy?
Why does he kick us always?

1471
01:09:30,516 --> 01:09:32,144
He kicks even if we does some mistake.

1472
01:09:32,224 --> 01:09:33,603
Hey, check this.

1473
01:09:33,683 --> 01:09:35,636
It's Gopi with a girl.

1474
01:09:35,716 --> 01:09:37,722
She is so cute.

1475
01:09:37,928 --> 01:09:39,971
Gopi is truly talented.

1476
01:09:40,168 --> 01:09:43,649
As per challenge, he went to Hyderabad
and loved a cute girl.

1477
01:09:43,729 --> 01:09:44,590
He is handsome...

1478
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:45,919
... and a good charactered guy, too.

1479
01:09:45,999 --> 01:09:48,265
Any girl can fall for him.

1480
01:09:48,345 --> 01:09:49,260
Yeah.

1481
01:09:49,340 --> 01:09:53,585
At last, Indu here and Gopi there
are getting married.

1482
01:09:53,665 --> 01:09:55,445
(Smiles)
Shut up.

1483
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:02,109
(Laughs)

1484
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:03,807
(Laughs)

1485
01:10:03,887 --> 01:10:06,174
I am going to win the challenge.

1486
01:10:06,617 --> 01:10:09,092
My anger on her will come to an end.

1487
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:11,967
Did you observe the change in him?

1488
01:10:12,047 --> 01:10:13,729
By now, seeing the pic,...

1489
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,766
...she will feel sad and unhappy.

1490
01:10:17,156 --> 01:10:19,329
Correct. She has to.

1491
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:20,777
Even while tying the knot,...

1492
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,663
...she will think of me...

1493
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:27,198
...I couldn't do Gopi anything...

1494
01:10:27,641 --> 01:10:30,538
...she will feel bad and
will die of that feeling.

1495
01:10:31,441 --> 01:10:33,668
For making her sad...

1496
01:10:33,748 --> 01:10:36,327
...my ego is fully satisfied.

1497
01:10:36,407 --> 01:10:38,403
His ego is fully satisfied.

1498
01:10:38,483 --> 01:10:39,581
She will marry...

1499
01:10:39,661 --> 01:10:41,387
...and fly to America...

1500
01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:46,337
...but still she will feel sad
for what I have sent her.

1501
01:10:46,716 --> 01:10:50,024
I will fully enjoy that kick...

1502
01:10:50,104 --> 01:10:51,894
...and in Amalapuram without her...

1503
01:10:51,974 --> 01:10:56,551
...I will apply fake smile to my face
and live like a dead body forever.

1504
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:01,243
What did you say?

1505
01:11:01,827 --> 01:11:03,102
What did you say at the end?

1506
01:11:09,346 --> 01:11:10,546
(Cries)

1507
01:11:14,849 --> 01:11:16,470
I want Gopi.

1508
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:29,070
I want Gopi.

1509
01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:32,385
(Slaps)
What dead body? What are you talking?

1510
01:11:32,882 --> 01:11:34,017
Yes, man.

1511
01:11:34,698 --> 01:11:37,995
Without her in Amalapuram,
I am just a dead body.

1512
01:11:39,509 --> 01:11:41,249
What happened, Indu?

1513
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:43,297
Why are you crying?

1514
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,081
Did you love Gopi?

1515
01:11:45,859 --> 01:11:46,994
Speak out.

1516
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:49,594
I love him so much.

1517
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,340
Without her, I will not have happiness.

1518
01:11:54,378 --> 01:11:55,935
With whom will I quarrel daily?

1519
01:11:57,200 --> 01:11:58,735
Who will I play with?

1520
01:12:01,643 --> 01:12:03,052
I feel like my heart...

1521
01:12:03,132 --> 01:12:05,560
...fell down and trembling with pain.

1522
01:12:06,014 --> 01:12:07,787
With so much of love in your heart...

1523
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:10,176
...why didn't you express it to her?

1524
01:12:10,256 --> 01:12:13,495
The only reason was fear of rejection.

1525
01:12:14,022 --> 01:12:15,557
Then why did you express now?

1526
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:22,195
When I saw him with another girl,
I couldn't bear it.

1527
01:12:23,438 --> 01:12:24,693
She is in my heart.

1528
01:12:25,601 --> 01:12:27,276
But I am not in her heart.

1529
01:12:27,774 --> 01:12:28,876
Even if I tell her, ...

1530
01:12:29,438 --> 01:12:30,930
...she will disagree with ego.

1531
01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:33,417
Why did you agree for this marriage then?

1532
01:12:33,843 --> 01:12:35,374
What have you done?

1533
01:12:35,454 --> 01:12:38,859
Atleast with this marriage,
I will know if I am in his heart...

1534
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:40,610
...or not.

1535
01:12:41,086 --> 01:12:43,237
With your stubbornness, you have
done a big mistake.

1536
01:12:44,762 --> 01:12:46,362
Now, Gopi's chapter has come to an end.

1537
01:12:46,838 --> 01:12:48,762
What close?

1538
01:12:48,842 --> 01:12:49,703
What are you talking about?

1539
01:13:14,202 --> 01:13:16,879
Your love will be successful.
I believe it.

1540
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,290
There is still time for marriage.
You start early in the morning.

1541
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:20,609
Go and stand in front of Indu.

1542
01:13:22,695 --> 01:13:25,344
Promise us that you will go.

1543
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,618
Please, go, man.

1544
01:13:29,391 --> 01:13:30,731
(Music)

1545
01:13:31,045 --> 01:13:32,093

1546
01:13:32,591 --> 01:13:34,072
'Attention please.'

1547
01:13:34,152 --> 01:13:35,737
Please give me a ticket to Rajahmundry.

1548

01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,266
It is ready on platform 1, Sir.

(Phone rings)

1554
01:13:54,753 --> 01:13:55,747
Hey!

1555
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:56,947
Hey!

1556
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:01,453
Stop there.

1557
01:14:01,875 --> 01:14:03,312
That is my IndÃ¹s gift.

1558
01:14:04,404 --> 01:14:06,880
Hey.

1559
01:14:08,517 --> 01:14:10,885
That phone is very important to me.

1560
01:14:10,965 --> 01:14:13,653
'is ready to leave from platform 2.'

1561
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:20,160
(Train horn)

1562
01:14:27,652 --> 01:14:28,538
Uh-oh.

1563
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:40,366

LET'S WAIT AND SEE.

1566
01:15:10,502 --> 01:15:11,821

Excuse me.

1572
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:37,978
Can I make a phone call please.

1573

1576
01:15:58,036 --> 01:16:01,156
May be it's him. If I switch off the
phone for a while, I will not be tortured.

1577
01:16:01,236 --> 01:16:03,026
(Bus horn)

1578
01:16:07,693 --> 01:16:09,369
(Phone rings)

1579
01:16:09,942 --> 01:16:11,250
Hello.
Hello, Divya.

1580
01:16:11,488 --> 01:16:13,282
It's me, Indu.
Hey Indu, hi.

1581
01:16:13,455 --> 01:16:15,218
How are you? Whose number is this?

1582
01:16:15,298 --> 01:16:16,870
I am in Hyderabad now.

1583
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:19,605
Hyderabad? What happened? Any problem?

1584
01:16:19,685 --> 01:16:22,600
Yeah, problem. I need to meet you urgently
and explain you everything.

1585
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,497
I came to Bangalore on some project work.

1586
01:16:25,577 --> 01:16:27,394
What do I do now?
I will be back in just two days.

1587
01:16:27,474 --> 01:16:30,741
Except you, I don't know anyone
in Hyderabad

1588
01:16:30,821 --> 01:16:32,172
You don't worry, Indu.

1589
01:16:32,252 --> 01:16:35,449
You stay in a working women's hostel.
Meanwhile I will be there.

1590
01:16:35,529 --> 01:16:36,358
No. The issue is...

1591
01:16:36,438 --> 01:16:38,863
Divya sister, call from the client.
Yeah, coming.

1592
01:16:38,943 --> 01:16:41,025
(Call disconnected)

1593
01:16:50,537 --> 01:16:52,256
(Vomit expression)

1594
01:16:52,526 --> 01:16:55,056
I am unable to drink
this cheap liquor, man.

1595
01:16:55,136 --> 01:16:56,780
Call that Satyanarayana.

1596
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:57,915
Yeah.

1597
01:16:58,607 --> 01:16:59,234
I will do it.

1598
01:17:00,348 --> 01:17:02,294
(Phone ringing)

1599
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,153
Tell me, Shankar.

1600
01:17:04,233 --> 01:17:07,765
Where are you, man. Please come fast.

1601
01:17:07,845 --> 01:17:09,008
I am in a tension, man.

1602
01:17:09,088 --> 01:17:10,792
My wife went to Kavitha jewellers...

1603
01:17:11,116 --> 01:17:14,305
...selected a necklace,
took estimate slip,...

1604
01:17:14,385 --> 01:17:17,479
...and said she will compare with
other shops. This happened 3 days back.

1605
01:17:17,559 --> 01:17:18,927
She is not back yet.

1606
01:17:19,122 --> 01:17:20,614
I am in tensed mood.

1607
01:17:20,694 --> 01:17:23,230
Only if I find her,
I will join back in duty.

1608
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:25,922
Sorry, man. Till then,
you have to drink cheap liquor.

1609
01:17:29,518 --> 01:17:30,415
(Cycle sound)

1610
01:17:35,020 --> 01:17:37,247
Why is everyone gazing at me?

1611
01:17:41,227 --> 01:17:43,076
Why are these people standing here?

1612
01:17:44,103 --> 01:17:45,216
(Slaps)

1613
01:17:48,092 --> 01:17:49,735
Where is Indu? Tell me.

1614
01:17:49,815 --> 01:17:51,501
Where is our Indu?

1615
01:17:52,161 --> 01:17:53,220
Hey!

1616
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,080
Tell me.
What happened to Indu?

1617
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:57,999
What! Are you playing dramas?
Stop.

1618
01:17:58,831 --> 01:18:01,733
To resolve a problem, egos will not work.
We need to maintain peace.

1619
01:18:01,813 --> 01:18:04,738
For what he has done,
we need to cut him into pieces.

1620
01:18:04,818 --> 01:18:09,214
Once you are here,
you have to maintain dignity.

1621
01:18:09,603 --> 01:18:12,389
Naidu, Sir. They couldn't
deal with our family directly...

1622
01:18:12,469 --> 01:18:15,860
...they trapped my little girl,
cheated her...

1623
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:17,816
...and eloped her.We lost our dignity.

1624
01:18:19,092 --> 01:18:20,941
We are unable to face
anyone in the village.

1625
01:18:21,524 --> 01:18:24,043
No family should face such difficulty.

1626
01:18:24,123 --> 01:18:25,449
What happened to Indu?

1627
01:18:26,022 --> 01:18:26,886
What happened?

1628
01:18:27,632 --> 01:18:28,822
You see for yourself.

1629
01:18:36,283 --> 01:18:38,283
Dad, pardon me.

1630
01:18:38,363 --> 01:18:41,483
I love Gopi. I can't live without him.

1631
01:18:41,706 --> 01:18:45,057
I am going for Gopi.
Please don't look for me.

1632
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:46,603
Your daughter, Indu.

1633
01:18:49,749 --> 01:18:51,543
Why are you smiling?
Please stop.

1634
01:18:51,623 --> 01:18:54,245
I never expected such issue
will arise in the village.

1635
01:18:54,325 --> 01:18:55,931
Please don't worry, Aiswarya Naidu, Sir.

1636
01:18:56,115 --> 01:18:59,726
I am asking Bangaru Naidu Sir
to resolve this issue.

1637
01:19:00,504 --> 01:19:03,250
If a family had injustice
because of our family...

1638
01:19:03,619 --> 01:19:04,689
...it is an insult to our family.

1639
01:19:04,769 --> 01:19:07,781
We are also equally sad ...

1640
01:19:08,149 --> 01:19:09,359
...for their daughter.

1641
01:19:10,051 --> 01:19:11,738
A girl is a girl for any family.

1642
01:19:12,408 --> 01:19:14,352
If a girl leaves a home like that...

1643
01:19:15,228 --> 01:19:16,795
...I can understand their situation.

1644
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:20,730
But our family is held responsible
for that.

1645
01:19:22,017 --> 01:19:23,119
This is very sad.

1646
01:19:24,543 --> 01:19:25,948
The one responsible for all this...

1647
01:19:27,289 --> 01:19:28,229
Gopi...

1648
01:19:28,651 --> 01:19:30,337
...we don't have any relation with him.

1649
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:32,629
Brother.

1650
01:19:32,709 --> 01:19:33,592
Everyone come with me.

1651
01:19:36,118 --> 01:19:37,307
(Music)

1652
01:19:39,447 --> 01:19:42,129
Brother, our Indu.
Stop.

1653
01:19:43,512 --> 01:19:46,381
Why do you care for someone who left us?

1654
01:19:46,461 --> 01:19:47,343
Let her go.

1655
01:19:56,486 --> 01:19:59,123
Are you feeling sad for what they said?
No.

1656
01:19:59,891 --> 01:20:02,529
I am happy that Indu is in love with me.

1657
01:20:02,918 --> 01:20:04,226
(Music)

1658
01:20:04,306 --> 01:20:05,610
Are you in love?

1659
01:20:05,815 --> 01:20:06,931
When?

1660
01:20:09,677 --> 01:20:12,261
(Smiles)

1661
01:20:12,985 --> 01:20:15,439
(Music)

1662
01:20:27,932 --> 01:20:32,017
â™ªIs she here or there? Where did she go?â™ª

1663
01:20:32,097 --> 01:20:35,929
â™ªWhere did she hide my heart?â™ª

1664
01:20:36,009 --> 01:20:40,032
â™ªI am overwhelmed with joy,
I feel like sky is underneath me.â™ª

1665
01:20:40,112 --> 01:20:44,161
â™ªMy lips are having fest of smiles.â™ª

1666
01:20:44,241 --> 01:20:48,259
â™ªI will search the whole city...â™ª

1667
01:20:48,339 --> 01:20:51,903
â™ª...I want to see you immediately, dear.â™ª

1668
01:20:52,768 --> 01:21:00,973
(Music)

1669
01:21:01,053 --> 01:21:09,276
(Bangles sound)

1670
01:21:09,589 --> 01:21:13,427
â™ªI can hear the sound of your bangles.â™ª

1671
01:21:13,676 --> 01:21:17,588
â™ªMy heart is running behind that sound.â™ª

1672
01:21:17,815 --> 01:21:21,999
â™ªI can feel your breathâ™ª

1673
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:25,882
â™ªI am living with the feel of your breathâ™ª

1674
01:21:50,594 --> 01:21:58,922
(Music)

1675
01:21:59,002 --> 01:22:03,095
â™ªI like you so much. You like me so much.â™ª

1676
01:22:03,175 --> 01:22:06,955
â™ªWhy did you hide your love with me?â™ª

1677
01:22:07,248 --> 01:22:11,356
â™ªAnger and botheration,
chafing and displeasure...â™ª

1678
01:22:11,436 --> 01:22:15,259
â™ª...with these, we were enemies till now.â™ª

1679
01:22:15,339 --> 01:22:19,382
â™ªWhat are you? Just with this question...â™ª

1680
01:22:19,462 --> 01:22:23,490
â™ª...we couldn't realise our love.â™ª

1681
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:27,631
â™ªBy the time we realised that
we are in love...â™ª

1682
01:22:27,711 --> 01:22:30,931
â™ª...we got separated.â™ª

1683
01:22:56,799 --> 01:23:05,094
(Music)

1684
01:23:05,174 --> 01:23:13,534
(Music)

1685
01:23:15,761 --> 01:23:18,129
(Music)

1686
01:23:19,372 --> 01:23:20,291
Uh-oh.

1687
01:23:20,932 --> 01:23:23,473
I lost your job because of you.

1688
01:23:23,732 --> 01:23:27,322
I will not believe you. I will get
you drinks, only if you show me money.

1689
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:29,192
Here are the credit cards.

1690
01:23:29,272 --> 01:23:31,343
Do you need more of them?
No Sir.

1691
01:23:34,987 --> 01:23:36,242
Is it new brand liquor?

1692
01:23:37,615 --> 01:23:38,436
Sir...

1693
01:23:38,516 --> 01:23:40,728
Your bill is great, Sir.

1694
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:41,755
Give me the card, Sir.

1695
01:23:42,112 --> 01:23:43,096
Sir.
Give the card, man.

1696
01:23:43,176 --> 01:23:45,561
Last time they reduced my salary
by your bill amount, Sir.

1697
01:23:45,641 --> 01:23:47,172
Please consider that as well, Sir.

1698
01:23:47,252 --> 01:23:49,550
Scratch all these cards and take it.

1699
01:23:49,630 --> 01:23:51,042
Take as much as you want.

1700
01:23:51,463 --> 01:23:52,340
Take it.

1701
01:23:54,837 --> 01:23:57,281
Sir, this is not working.

1702
01:23:57,361 --> 01:23:59,356
Swipe it again.

1703
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:00,751
2266
DECLINED.

1704
01:24:01,205 --> 01:24:02,318
This is also not working, Sir.

1705
01:24:02,398 --> 01:24:03,486
Swipe another card.
DECLINED.

1706
01:24:04,972 --> 01:24:06,043
(Music)
DECLINED.

1707
01:24:07,416 --> 01:24:08,724
Even this is not working.
DECLINED.

1708
01:24:10,421 --> 01:24:12,356
(Music)
DECLINED.

1709
01:24:12,594 --> 01:24:15,261
These are not working.
Swipe it.

1710
01:24:15,341 --> 01:24:16,472
DECLINED.

1711
01:24:16,861 --> 01:24:19,629
What is it?
You have been swiping the cards?

1712
01:24:19,802 --> 01:24:22,570
No card is working, Sir.
You should check that before you serve.

1713
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:24,548
I can see the cards...

1714
01:24:24,628 --> 01:24:25,964
...how will I know the balance, Sir?

1715
01:24:26,044 --> 01:24:28,299
Call the control room...

1716
01:24:28,379 --> 01:24:29,975
...push them inside and push him outside.

1717
01:24:30,055 --> 01:24:32,202
Sir.
Out.

1718
01:24:32,282 --> 01:24:33,272
It was they who didn't pay the bill.

1719
01:24:33,352 --> 01:24:34,570
Why are you pushing me away, Sir?

1720
01:24:34,650 --> 01:24:38,159
This is unfair, Sir.

1721
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:39,273
Hello, control room.

1722
01:24:40,030 --> 01:24:41,943
Narayana is here.

1723
01:24:42,023 --> 01:24:43,424
Greetings, Sir.

1724
01:24:43,504 --> 01:24:45,338
What is this drinking and eating?

1725
01:24:46,066 --> 01:24:48,390
Whatever you drank and ate...

1726
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:50,293
...if we send it to a drought area,...

1727
01:24:50,373 --> 01:24:51,785
...it will be sufficient for a month.

1728
01:24:52,412 --> 01:24:55,396
Is it stomach or something else?

1729
01:24:55,709 --> 01:24:57,903
Let's discuss all this in the station.
Constables.

1730
01:24:58,174 --> 01:24:59,147
Get them on the jeep.
Yes, Sir.

1731
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:00,779
(Police siren)

1732
01:25:03,482 --> 01:25:04,574
Here's my 500. Here's my 500.

1733
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:06,725
Sankar, which is the next hotel?

1734
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:08,562
Brother, decide it.

1735
01:25:09,740 --> 01:25:11,838
Oh, no. They closed the gate.

1736
01:25:13,513 --> 01:25:14,746
Is anyone here?

1737
01:25:15,038 --> 01:25:17,157
Someone please open the gate.

1738
01:25:20,994 --> 01:25:21,718

1739
01:25:24,659 --> 01:25:25,405
(Gate open)

1740
01:25:38,070 --> 01:25:40,621
Who are you, lady?

1741
01:25:40,701 --> 01:25:42,751
I stay in the hostel.

1742
01:25:42,999 --> 01:25:45,507
They closed the gate as I was late.

1743
01:25:45,587 --> 01:25:47,356
Oh, no.

1744
01:25:47,436 --> 01:25:49,475
You sleep here and I will sleep there.

1745
01:26:16,659 --> 01:26:18,951

1747
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:34,388
Please pick up the phone.

1748
01:26:34,468 --> 01:26:36,453
(Phone rings)

1749
01:26:37,253 --> 01:26:40,346
Why is phone ringing here?

1750
01:26:42,594 --> 01:26:43,783
Please lift the phone.

1751
01:26:45,621 --> 01:26:47,135
(Phone rings)

1752
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,891
It is a remembrance of my Indu.

1753
01:26:51,575 --> 01:26:52,840
Whose phone must it be?

1754
01:27:00,865 --> 01:27:02,054
(Phone rings)

1755
01:27:05,319 --> 01:27:07,254
(Phone rings)

1756
01:27:10,970 --> 01:27:12,905
Please answer.

1757
01:27:21,144 --> 01:27:23,155
'The customer you are calling...'

1758
01:27:23,393 --> 01:27:24,355
Oh.

1759
01:27:25,566 --> 01:27:26,582
Gopi.

1760
01:27:27,804 --> 01:27:29,015
This is Gopi phone.

1761
01:27:34,175 --> 01:27:37,591
(Music)
PASSWORD WRONG

1762
01:27:38,599 --> 01:27:42,189
(Music)

1763
01:27:43,053 --> 01:27:44,805
What could be the password?

1764
01:27:46,956 --> 01:27:49,477
'What is the password of your phone?'

1765
01:27:49,557 --> 01:27:50,835
'Buremma'

1766
01:27:50,915 --> 01:27:54,018
Buremma
Password correct.

1767
01:28:07,210 --> 01:28:11,588
Hey Indu...Since there is no chance
to talk to you directly...

1768
01:28:11,668 --> 01:28:13,469
...whatever I wanted to
tell you directly...

1769
01:28:13,728 --> 01:28:15,307
...I am talking to this cell phone...

1770
01:28:15,387 --> 01:28:17,620
...and reducing a little of my suffering.

1771
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:19,315
This mobile is my life.

1772
01:28:19,607 --> 01:28:20,591
You know why?

1773
01:28:21,088 --> 01:28:22,288
You made me buy this.

1774
01:28:22,368 --> 01:28:24,493
This is the only thing
I have as your memory.

1775
01:28:24,958 --> 01:28:28,277
Even in my sleep, I keep it
on my heart and sleep.

1776
01:28:28,357 --> 01:28:30,667
Whenever I see it,
I remember your naughtiness...

1777
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:33,564
...and your innocence.

1778
01:28:35,024 --> 01:28:37,402
I know it's impossible
for me to get your love.

1779
01:28:38,682 --> 01:28:40,163
I am in madly love with you.

1780
01:28:40,243 --> 01:28:42,423
So mad that if I can't get your love...

1781
01:28:42,503 --> 01:28:44,974
...I will truly get mad.

1782
01:28:45,054 --> 01:28:46,661
If we feel sad,
when we share with family...

1783
01:28:47,050 --> 01:28:48,563
...or friends...

1784
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:51,366
...it will reduce the sadness.

1785
01:28:51,539 --> 01:28:53,264
But I can't share my sadness...

1786
01:28:53,344 --> 01:28:56,663
...with anyone else.

1787
01:28:57,225 --> 01:28:59,160
(Cries)

1788
01:29:00,123 --> 01:29:02,379
I feel like one thing should happen to me.

1789
01:29:02,459 --> 01:29:04,076
I should lose this phone...

1790
01:29:04,156 --> 01:29:07,795
...and if you get it, it would be great.

1791
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:11,647
Because you will know my feelings
atleast this way.

1792
01:29:12,836 --> 01:29:14,933
You were so cute in your new dress, Indu.

1793
01:29:16,047 --> 01:29:18,058
May be I will not sleep the whole night.

1794
01:29:18,138 --> 01:29:19,517

1795
01:29:32,014 --> 01:29:37,689
'Your account is low on balance.
Please dial *130#'

(Cries)

1797
01:30:05,286 --> 01:30:08,259
A lady was killed brutally yesterday.

1798
01:30:08,339 --> 01:30:12,784
Police said that she is Purvi, a
social activist in Yousufguda.

1799
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:17,097
Can you please draw some amount from ATM.

1800

(Music)

1801
01:30:18,658 --> 01:30:20,715
Give me, grand mother.

1802
01:30:22,423 --> 01:30:24,229
Tell me, madam.

1803
01:30:25,591 --> 01:30:26,584
Can you please recharge.
Please tell me the number.

1804
01:30:26,664 --> 01:30:30,718
9533590390 is the number.

1805
01:30:30,798 --> 01:30:33,529
Mobile is switched off.
Can you connect the charger please.

1806

(Music)

1807
01:30:45,800 --> 01:30:47,497
Here. Be careful.

1808
01:30:47,577 --> 01:30:49,173
Stay blessed, son.

Gopi.

Gopi.

Gopi.

1814
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,514
Stop, Gopi.

1815

Gopi.

Gopi.

(Mob mutters)

1820
01:31:51,526 --> 01:31:54,765
Move away.

1821
01:31:56,473 --> 01:31:57,424
Indu.

1822
01:31:58,192 --> 01:31:59,165
Uh-oh.

1823
01:31:59,619 --> 01:32:00,429
Indu.

1824
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:06,566
Gopi.

1825

Gopi.

Indu.

1827
01:32:11,749 --> 01:32:13,431
What happened?
I have seen, Gopi.

1828
01:32:14,336 --> 01:32:15,449
Who is Gopi?

1829
01:32:15,622 --> 01:32:18,293
Come on. Tell me what happened.

1830
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:43,698
(Phone rings)

1831
01:32:43,925 --> 01:32:45,784
Oh no. Mobile.

1832
01:32:46,135 --> 01:32:47,216
I left it in the shop.

1833
01:32:48,222 --> 01:32:49,292
I will call you back.

1834
01:32:51,443 --> 01:32:53,097
Sir, Sir.

1835
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:54,438
What is it?

1836
01:32:54,518 --> 01:32:55,854
I left my mobile in the shop.

1837
01:32:55,934 --> 01:32:57,736
Shop is closed now.
You can come in the morning.

1838

(Music)

1839
01:33:01,692 --> 01:33:05,779
I lost my jobs because of those idiots.

1840
01:33:06,157 --> 01:33:07,541
This is the only one left.

1841
01:33:07,913 --> 01:33:10,529
Please see that those
idiots don't come here.

1842
01:33:11,772 --> 01:33:12,734
Brother.

1843
01:33:13,513 --> 01:33:15,091
My stomach is not good.

1844
01:33:15,171 --> 01:33:16,637
Can you serve at table 13, please.

1845
01:33:16,717 --> 01:33:19,595
Please.
You are spending more time in bathroom.

1846
01:33:19,675 --> 01:33:21,293
Stop drinking the left outs by customers.

1847
01:33:21,373 --> 01:33:22,514
Stomach will co-operate.

1848
01:33:22,594 --> 01:33:23,768
Idiot, get lost.

1849
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:27,282
He is coming.

1850
01:33:27,362 --> 01:33:29,519
Excuse me, Sir.
Yes.

1851
01:33:29,768 --> 01:33:31,357
You idiots.

1852
01:33:31,437 --> 01:33:32,438
You are here?

1853
01:33:32,518 --> 01:33:33,876
I will not serve you drinks.

1854
01:33:34,168 --> 01:33:36,979
I

1855
01:33:37,059 --> 01:33:38,525
It's not fair to take away the drinks.
Manager.

1856
01:33:38,827 --> 01:33:40,027
Yes, Sir.
Manager...

1857
01:33:40,107 --> 01:33:41,994
He is not serving us the drinks.

1858
01:33:42,074 --> 01:33:42,935
Ask him to get it.
Sorry.

1859
01:33:43,015 --> 01:33:45,335
Hey, serve them the drinks.
I will not serve them, Sir.

1860
01:33:45,415 --> 01:33:47,140
I am telling you.

1861
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:48,362
Whoever tells me, i will not serve them.

1862
01:33:48,442 --> 01:33:51,737
You are not serving my orders?
(Slaps)

1863
01:33:51,909 --> 01:33:53,207
You beat me?

1864
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:54,677
Sir, Sir.

1865
01:33:54,757 --> 01:33:57,607
Please, Sir. I don't understand what I am
doing with this frustration.

1866
01:33:57,687 --> 01:34:00,141
Because of these guys, I am confused, Sir.

1867
01:34:00,221 --> 01:34:02,520
Why are you hanging with me, guys?

1868
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,784
What did I do?
Leave them.

1869
01:34:05,864 --> 01:34:08,098
Get lost.

1870
01:34:10,109 --> 01:34:12,747
'New kind of frauds in the city.'

1871
01:34:12,952 --> 01:34:15,266
'Banjara Hills, ASI, Satyanarayana'

1872
01:34:15,346 --> 01:34:17,871
'...has formed groups of youth...'

1873
01:34:17,951 --> 01:34:20,617
'...sends them to star hotels
and hitech bars...'

1874
01:34:20,697 --> 01:34:23,102
'...let's them drink and
make a huge bill...'

1875
01:34:23,182 --> 01:34:25,220
'...then he asks them
not to pay the bill...'

1876
01:34:25,300 --> 01:34:27,253
'...then acts like arresting them...'

1877
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:30,475
'...he collects 500 or 1000 rupees
and let's them go away.'

1878
01:34:30,555 --> 01:34:32,470
'A little while ago, Satyanarayana...'

1879
01:34:32,550 --> 01:34:35,486
'...was arrested red-handed
by the Commissioner.'

1880
01:34:35,566 --> 01:34:39,400
'It seems that Sankar and
Nalla Babu started this.'

1881
01:34:39,594 --> 01:34:40,814
'Now, the police...'

1882
01:34:40,894 --> 01:34:42,602
'...is searching for them.'
They displayed our photos too.

1883
01:34:42,829 --> 01:34:45,780
'Police has released
their phone numbers too.'

1884
01:34:45,860 --> 01:34:48,937
Let's leave.
Hey!

1885
01:34:49,017 --> 01:34:51,457
Hey, stop. Catch them.

1886
01:34:51,537 --> 01:34:53,489
Catch them. Beat them.

1887
01:34:53,569 --> 01:34:55,824
They spoiled my life.

1888
01:34:55,904 --> 01:34:58,462
Stop, stop.

1889
01:34:58,542 --> 01:35:00,769
Check their pockets.

1890
01:35:00,849 --> 01:35:03,007
Remove them.

1891
01:35:03,244 --> 01:35:05,363
Sir.
Don't check our pockets.

1892
01:35:05,443 --> 01:35:06,499
We could get only these, Sir.

1893
01:35:07,731 --> 01:35:09,331
Even if we beat them...

1894
01:35:09,411 --> 01:35:11,158
...we can't recover much.

1895
01:35:11,238 --> 01:35:13,485
Take away these sims and put in new sims.

1896
01:35:15,020 --> 01:35:17,777
Let's ask the feelings of the main culprit
of this scam, Satyanarayana.

1897
01:35:17,857 --> 01:35:18,577
Please tell us, Sir.

1898
01:35:18,657 --> 01:35:20,480
My wife was my world...

1899
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:23,006
...and my salary was all that I had...

1900
01:35:23,086 --> 01:35:24,621
...then, two black idiots...

1901
01:35:24,701 --> 01:35:27,464
...grabbed me into this
and spoiled everything.

1902
01:35:27,723 --> 01:35:29,723
Commissioner Sir,...

1903
01:35:29,803 --> 01:35:31,916
...please let me out for an hour.

1904
01:35:32,164 --> 01:35:33,699
I will murder those guys...

1905
01:35:33,779 --> 01:35:35,397
...and will surrender myself.

1906
01:35:35,477 --> 01:35:39,635
The culprit is asking the Commissioner
for permission to kill them...

1907
01:35:39,715 --> 01:35:42,771
...and the Commissioner thinking
whether to grant him or not.

1908
01:35:42,851 --> 01:35:43,917
Why are you pulling me into this?

1909
01:35:44,133 --> 01:35:45,625
What's this press?
That is press, Sir.

1910
01:35:45,705 --> 01:35:46,619
They will trap anyone.

1911
01:35:46,699 --> 01:35:48,781
We lost all our dignity because of him.

1912
01:35:48,861 --> 01:35:50,417
Put 10 sections on him...

1913
01:35:50,497 --> 01:35:52,244
...and see that he doesn't come
out of the jail.

1914
01:35:52,324 --> 01:35:55,185
It's very dangerous to open mouth
in front of media.

1915
01:35:55,265 --> 01:35:57,941
This is how they are blaming press.

1916
01:35:58,021 --> 01:36:01,565
My God! If I speak two more minutes
with media, I will be hanged till death.

1917
01:36:01,645 --> 01:36:03,132
I will not talk to you.

1918
01:36:05,446 --> 01:36:08,267
Yesterday I left my mobile here.

1919
01:36:08,347 --> 01:36:10,840
How can you leave a mobile like that?

1920
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:11,857
Take it.

1921
01:36:11,937 --> 01:36:13,424
Thank you so much, Sir.
Okay.

1922
01:36:23,328 --> 01:36:27,220
'The customer you are
calling is not available.'

1923
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:29,447
'Please call again after some time.'

1924
01:36:30,031 --> 01:36:31,144
This is it. Get down.

1925
01:36:32,377 --> 01:36:33,631
Give me the money.

1926
01:36:34,585 --> 01:36:35,602
Here is the money.

1927
01:36:36,542 --> 01:36:38,012
Why have you given 150, old lady?

1928
01:36:38,092 --> 01:36:40,585
If at all you asked with respect,
not just 150,...

1929
01:36:40,665 --> 01:36:42,391
...I would have given you 250 rupees.

1930
01:36:42,471 --> 01:36:45,240
But you hurt my ego.

1931
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,002
Even if I agree, it will not agree.

1932
01:36:47,082 --> 01:36:48,408
Ego for an old woman!

1933
01:36:48,488 --> 01:36:51,002
I am from Konaseema.

1934
01:36:51,082 --> 01:36:52,548
If you deal with me,...

1935
01:36:52,628 --> 01:36:55,994
...I will remove your heart
and dry it in sun.

1936
01:36:56,074 --> 01:36:57,723
If I hit you with this rod...

1937
01:36:57,803 --> 01:36:59,940
Why are you showing off on old people?

1938
01:37:00,491 --> 01:37:01,713
You came as a wrestler...

1939
01:37:02,167 --> 01:37:03,096
...you are young...

1940
01:37:03,176 --> 01:37:05,161
...should I fight with you?

1941
01:37:05,355 --> 01:37:08,036
(Music)

1942
01:37:11,949 --> 01:37:12,695
Hey!

1943
01:37:12,775 --> 01:37:15,636
Early morning, instead of doing Yoga,
why are you making nuisance?

1944
01:37:15,716 --> 01:37:18,889
What's all this nonsense
in a peaceful place?

1945
01:37:18,969 --> 01:37:21,289
Who are you to come in between us?

1946
01:37:21,369 --> 01:37:23,873
Shall I kick you also?
Will you kick me?

1947
01:37:23,953 --> 01:37:27,220
Which area are you from?
Punjagutta.

1948
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,014
Do you know Suresh Goud there?

1949
01:37:29,094 --> 01:37:30,495
Who doesn't know him?

1950
01:37:30,575 --> 01:37:32,268
This auto was by Goud brother's grace.

1951
01:37:32,348 --> 01:37:35,501
Do you know who planted
Corporate madness in him?

1952
01:37:35,581 --> 01:37:38,762
Who?
Go ask him. He'll tell about Sundarajan.

1953
01:37:39,216 --> 01:37:42,589
Sorry, brother.
Listen. I will tell you one thing.

1954
01:37:42,669 --> 01:37:44,395
Keep these egos at home...

1955
01:37:44,475 --> 01:37:45,908
...love even your enemy.

1956
01:37:45,988 --> 01:37:47,152
Life will be cool.

1957
01:37:47,232 --> 01:37:48,843
Did you understand?
Yes, brother. Got it.

1958
01:37:48,923 --> 01:37:50,540
Go and look for customers.

1959
01:37:50,757 --> 01:37:51,438
Go.
Okay, brother.

1960
01:37:51,518 --> 01:37:52,216
Go.

1961
01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:57,609
Brother, you seem like...

1962
01:37:57,689 --> 01:38:00,027
...new to Hyderabad.

1963
01:38:00,107 --> 01:38:01,937
My name is Gopi. I am from
Amalapuram, Sir.

1964
01:38:02,017 --> 01:38:04,056
What? Are you from Amalapuram?

1965
01:38:04,262 --> 01:38:05,289
Yeah.

1966
01:38:05,812 --> 01:38:09,996
Konaseema, Coconuts, Putareku sweets...

1967
01:38:10,076 --> 01:38:12,353
...Polasa fish, Godavari water...

1968
01:38:12,433 --> 01:38:16,180
...if I start telling about it,
this whole day will be lost.

1969
01:38:16,260 --> 01:38:18,526
Come. Let's talk while drinking tea.

1970
01:38:18,606 --> 01:38:20,786
Thank you so much for
showing concern, Sir.

1971
01:38:20,866 --> 01:38:22,115
Why are you saying this, brother?

1972
01:38:22,195 --> 01:38:25,467
I just felt like a brother, seeing you.

1973
01:38:25,672 --> 01:38:28,149
That's fine. Take this card.

1974
01:38:28,701 --> 01:38:30,863
Don't forget that you have
a relative in Hyderabad.

1975
01:38:30,943 --> 01:38:34,149
Good or bad, just give a call.
This brother will take care of it.

1976
01:38:34,229 --> 01:38:34,934
Did you get it?
Yes, Sir.

1977
01:38:35,014 --> 01:38:35,793
Take the vehicle.

1978
01:38:37,570 --> 01:38:40,997
Ranga, he is from Godavari, it seems.

1979
01:38:41,077 --> 01:38:42,888
Yeah, mom.

1980
01:38:42,968 --> 01:38:44,834
You keep looking, idiot.

1981
01:38:44,914 --> 01:38:46,802
He was saying so many things
to your mother...

1982
01:38:46,882 --> 01:38:48,558
...you couldn't even respond.

1983
01:38:48,638 --> 01:38:51,736
That boy has shown the pride of Godavari.

1984
01:38:51,816 --> 01:38:54,980
I kept quiet because your
voice is higher than mine.

1985
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:55,931
You silly fellow.

1986
01:38:56,266 --> 01:38:57,974
That's fine. Ranga...

1987
01:38:58,054 --> 01:39:00,223
...how do you think he is for our Manga?

1988
01:39:00,303 --> 01:39:01,704
He is good, mom.

1989
01:39:01,784 --> 01:39:02,915
Idiot.

1990
01:39:02,995 --> 01:39:06,125
You didn't even think of it.

1991
01:39:06,205 --> 01:39:09,349
My voice is less when compared to yours.

1992
01:39:09,663 --> 01:39:11,382
Hey! Wait.

1993
01:39:11,462 --> 01:39:13,403
My mother will not wait.

1994
01:39:16,236 --> 01:39:19,989
Ranga, is he the Godavari guy?

1995
01:39:20,486 --> 01:39:22,378
Yes, mother. He is our Godavari guy.

1996
01:39:24,897 --> 01:39:25,967
Godavari Babu.

1997
01:39:26,854 --> 01:39:31,644
Hey! Why did you run like that, yesterday?

1998
01:39:31,724 --> 01:39:34,736
I had an urgent work.

1999
01:39:34,953 --> 01:39:36,369
That's fine, man.

2000
01:39:36,844 --> 01:39:39,212
Don't mind that I am asking you here.

2001
01:39:39,292 --> 01:39:41,384
We are looking for matches for Manga.

2002
01:39:41,464 --> 01:39:44,843
We are looking for a nice guy, like you.

2003
01:39:46,043 --> 01:39:48,616
If you don't have any objection,
after going back to village,...

2004
01:39:48,696 --> 01:39:52,229
...we will come and talk to your elders.
No grandma. I don't have such thoughts.

2005
01:39:52,737 --> 01:39:55,677
Do you think she is fat?

2006
01:39:55,757 --> 01:39:57,904
Try to understand, grandma.

2007
01:39:58,153 --> 01:40:00,153
I am in love with a girl from my village.

2008
01:40:00,233 --> 01:40:03,476
She left a letter mentioning that she also
loves me and came to Hyderabad.

2009
01:40:03,556 --> 01:40:05,422
I am madly searching for her.

2010
01:40:05,605 --> 01:40:06,805
Oh, no.

2011
01:40:06,885 --> 01:40:08,924
Manga is unlucky.

2012
01:40:09,292 --> 01:40:11,735
God knows who that lucky girl is.
Indu.

2013
01:40:17,556 --> 01:40:25,618
â™ªDon't know...what happened earlierâ™ª

2014
01:40:26,385 --> 01:40:30,677
â™ªUnknown love...â™ª

2015
01:40:31,174 --> 01:40:37,380
â™ª...brought us together.â™ª

2016
01:40:39,391 --> 01:40:40,375
Gopi.

2017
01:40:41,895 --> 01:40:43,343
(Cries)

2018
01:40:43,570 --> 01:40:44,630
(Cries)

2019
01:40:46,327 --> 01:40:51,008
â™ªI have seen me in you and left myself.â™ª

2020
01:40:51,088 --> 01:40:55,896
â™ªYou know, every wish in me is yours.â™ª

2021
01:40:55,976 --> 01:41:00,599
â™ªEvery breath I take is yoursâ™ª

2022
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:05,625
â™ªThe only thing left me is you.â™ª

2023
01:41:05,705 --> 01:41:09,577
â™ªIf anyone asks me who is your life...â™ª

2024
01:41:09,657 --> 01:41:15,079
â™ªI'll say that it's you even after deathâ™ª

2025
01:41:15,159 --> 01:41:19,079
â™ªDon't know if we got separated...â™ª

2026
01:41:19,159 --> 01:41:24,703
â™ª...or became one and here we are.â™ª

2027
01:41:24,783 --> 01:41:28,724
â™ªDon't know if it's a dream...â™ª

2028
01:41:28,804 --> 01:41:35,178
â™ª...we met each other in such situation.â™ª

2029
01:41:56,363 --> 01:42:01,109
â™ªI fell for youâ™ª

2030
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:05,220
â™ªI spend every moment for your love.â™ª

2031
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:10,651
â™ªI searched for you in my dreams.â™ª

2032
01:42:10,731 --> 01:42:15,062
â™ªWhat do I tell you if you
stand in front of me?â™ª

2033
01:42:15,142 --> 01:42:19,069
â™ªYou touch my breath in my heartâ™ª

2034
01:42:19,149 --> 01:42:24,586
â™ªYou give life to the lonely dream.â™ª

2035
01:42:24,666 --> 01:42:28,751
â™ªDon't know if it's my heart...â™ª

2036
01:42:28,831 --> 01:42:34,144
â™ª...we are together now.â™ª

2037
01:42:34,224 --> 01:42:38,300
â™ªDon't know if it's a dream...â™ª

2038
01:42:38,380 --> 01:42:43,879
â™ª...we met in such a situation.â™ª

2039
01:42:43,959 --> 01:42:48,621
â™ªI saw me in you and left myself.â™ª

2040
01:42:48,701 --> 01:42:53,918
â™ªYou know, every wish of mine is yours.â™ª

2041
01:43:12,707 --> 01:43:16,630
â™ªDon't know if it's my heart...â™ª

2042
01:43:16,710 --> 01:43:22,375
â™ª...we met in such a situation.â™ª

2043
01:43:22,455 --> 01:43:26,252
â™ªDon't know if it's a dream...â™ª

2044
01:43:26,332 --> 01:43:31,867
â™ª...we met in such a situation.â™ª

2045
01:43:31,947 --> 01:43:36,451
â™ªI saw me in you and left myself.â™ª

2046
01:43:36,743 --> 01:43:42,661
â™ªYou know, every wish of mine is yours.â™ª

2047
01:43:56,651 --> 01:43:57,743
Surrender yourself.

2048
01:43:58,111 --> 01:44:00,410
Sir, what's all this?

2049
01:44:00,723 --> 01:44:01,956
Why did you surround us?

2050
01:44:02,036 --> 01:44:05,112
You are acting well. I will shoot you.

2051
01:44:05,192 --> 01:44:07,642
Sir, I think you have mistaken
me to someone else.

2052
01:44:07,722 --> 01:44:09,242
My name is Gopi and I am from
Amalapuram, Sir.

2053
01:44:09,322 --> 01:44:11,667
You came from a village and
planned to fool us?

2054
01:44:12,326 --> 01:44:14,867
How will you escape so easily
after murdering someone?

2055
01:44:15,861 --> 01:44:18,240
But you couldn't guess that
you can't escape from me.

2056
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,975
Sir, why will I murder someone?

2057
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:23,247
This is too much, Sir.

2058
01:44:23,982 --> 01:44:26,738
I will shoot you if you act smart.

2059
01:44:26,818 --> 01:44:28,403
Sir, I didn't murder anyone.

2060
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:31,719
I am telling the truth, Sir.

2061
01:44:35,438 --> 01:44:37,784
You trapped that girl and
killed her brutally, right?

2062
01:44:37,864 --> 01:44:39,514
Sir, I don't even know that girl.

2063
01:44:39,594 --> 01:44:41,763
She just took a selfie with me, Sir.

2064
01:44:41,843 --> 01:44:45,210
Are you a celebrity to
take selfie with you? Come.

2065
01:44:45,405 --> 01:44:47,286
Sir.
Gopi.

2066
01:44:47,621 --> 01:44:49,059
Indu.

2067
01:44:51,016 --> 01:44:53,062
Indu.
Gopi.

2068
01:44:54,348 --> 01:44:56,273
Please leave Gopi.

2069
01:44:56,662 --> 01:44:58,251
Indu.
Gopi.

2070
01:44:59,138 --> 01:45:00,738
Indu.

2071
01:45:01,390 --> 01:45:02,763
Get on the jeep.
Sir.

2072
01:45:04,417 --> 01:45:06,763
Sir, you must have mistaken.

2073
01:45:07,368 --> 01:45:09,011
Gopi is not such a guy, Sir.

2074
01:45:09,271 --> 01:45:10,449
He is a very good person.

2075
01:45:11,629 --> 01:45:13,337
Please leave him, Sir.

2076
01:45:13,417 --> 01:45:15,359
Are you certifying about his character?

2077
01:45:15,542 --> 01:45:18,267
Listen to me and go back to your place.
He is a cheater.

2078
01:45:18,894 --> 01:45:20,072
Please, Sir.
Take her away.

2079
01:45:20,407 --> 01:45:21,791
Sir, Sir.

2080
01:45:21,871 --> 01:45:24,272
(Police siren)

2081
01:45:24,650 --> 01:45:25,732
Sir.

2082
01:45:27,094 --> 01:45:28,326
Gopi.

2083
01:45:30,337 --> 01:45:31,148
Indu.

2084
01:45:31,796 --> 01:45:33,249
Gopi.
Indu.

2085
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:37,022
Gopi.
Indu.

2086
01:45:39,736 --> 01:45:41,952
I haven't done anything, Indu.
Please stop.

2087
01:45:43,617 --> 01:45:45,066
Gopi.

2088
01:45:46,266 --> 01:45:47,380
Gopi.

2089
01:45:53,706 --> 01:45:55,512
Gopi.

2090
01:45:56,236 --> 01:45:57,922
'He threw a net of love.'

2091
01:45:58,002 --> 01:45:59,371
'He trapped...'

2092
01:45:59,451 --> 01:46:01,976
'...and murdered her brutally.'

2093
01:46:02,056 --> 01:46:04,171
'Gopi from Amalapuram...'

2094
01:46:04,251 --> 01:46:07,965
'...cheated Purvi from Banjara Hills
in the name of love...'

2095
01:46:08,045 --> 01:46:09,944
'...and killed her brutally.'

2096
01:46:10,024 --> 01:46:14,192
'The police arrested the culprit today.'

2097
01:46:14,272 --> 01:46:18,820
'Gopi is being interrogated by
Banjara Hills DCP, Chandrashekhar.'

2098
01:46:18,900 --> 01:46:21,090
'Talking to the media,
DCP Chandrashekhar...'

2099
01:46:21,170 --> 01:46:22,712
'Gopi is from Amalapuram.'

2100
01:46:22,939 --> 01:46:24,560
'He killed a girl named Purvi.'

2101
01:46:24,852 --> 01:46:26,223
'Investigation is going on.'

2102
01:46:26,303 --> 01:46:28,482
'Once complete,
will let you know the details.'

2103
01:46:29,877 --> 01:46:31,120
Hey Gopi,...

2104
01:46:31,747 --> 01:46:32,990
...what is all this?

2105
01:46:33,790 --> 01:46:35,174
How can you murder someone?

2106
01:46:35,254 --> 01:46:36,846
I am very confused.

2107
01:46:37,419 --> 01:46:40,489
I insulted you in front of everyone.

2108
01:46:40,569 --> 01:46:42,651
It might be my curse, son.

2109
01:46:43,505 --> 01:46:46,219
Hey, what's all this?
I have done nothing.

2110
01:46:46,438 --> 01:46:48,027
We know that you have done nothing.

2111
01:46:48,107 --> 01:46:49,919
But how will we come out of this?

2112
01:46:49,999 --> 01:46:51,551
Don't we have a way to get out of this?

2113
01:46:52,870 --> 01:46:55,497
'Do not forget that you have a relative
in Hyderabad.'

2114
01:46:56,118 --> 01:46:57,069
Wait.

2115
01:46:58,172 --> 01:46:59,458
Greetings, Sir.
Hey.

2116
01:46:59,538 --> 01:47:00,615
Who are all these people?

2117
01:47:00,874 --> 01:47:01,955
Come here.

2118
01:47:02,150 --> 01:47:03,858
Greetings, Sir.

2119
01:47:04,982 --> 01:47:05,934
My son, Sir.

2120
01:47:06,014 --> 01:47:09,279
So what? Is he a great person?

2121
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:10,393
He murdered someone.

2122
01:47:10,620 --> 01:47:13,268
Go and do your work. Go.

2123
01:47:13,441 --> 01:47:15,063
Send them outside.

2124
01:47:19,391 --> 01:47:22,559
Now Sundarrajan will give his donation
cheque to the organisation.

2125
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:24,451
(Claps)

2126
01:47:27,567 --> 01:47:30,141
Taking classes, giving speech...

2127
01:47:30,476 --> 01:47:31,553
...I don't like it.

2128
01:47:31,633 --> 01:47:35,946
But I ask youth one direct question.

2129
01:47:36,508 --> 01:47:40,344
You are not spoiling just yourself...

2130
01:47:40,809 --> 01:47:45,512
...your family, your place, your state,
your country, everything is spoiling.

2131
01:47:45,592 --> 01:47:47,998
Realise yourself what I am trying to say.

2132
01:47:48,193 --> 01:47:50,236
Leave those drugs, man.

2133
01:47:50,485 --> 01:47:52,571
What is in that, man.

2134
01:47:52,809 --> 01:47:57,285
If I have spoken something wrong,
I apologise for that.

2135
01:47:57,501 --> 01:47:58,582
Please hold this mike, Sir.

2136
01:47:58,662 --> 01:47:59,674
One minute.
Thank you, Sir.

2137
01:48:00,169 --> 01:48:01,585
(Claps)

2138
01:48:02,406 --> 01:48:04,158
Hello, who's speaking?

2139
01:48:04,460 --> 01:48:05,671
I am Gopi's father, Sir.

2140
01:48:05,942 --> 01:48:06,882
Gopi?

2141
01:48:06,962 --> 01:48:08,071
Amalapuram...

2142
01:48:08,151 --> 01:48:09,336
That Amalapuram Gopi?

2143
01:48:09,416 --> 01:48:10,666
Yes, Sir.
What happened?

2144
01:48:10,746 --> 01:48:12,681
He was arrested in a murder case.

2145
01:48:12,761 --> 01:48:14,692
Oh! Is it?

2146
01:48:15,167 --> 01:48:15,665
Which station?

2147
01:48:15,745 --> 01:48:17,308
(Music)

2148
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:22,162
Gopi.

2149
01:48:22,366 --> 01:48:24,388
Don't worry. I am here. I will take care.

2150
01:48:24,468 --> 01:48:26,712
Why did you come again.
Hello DCP Sir.

2151
01:48:26,972 --> 01:48:28,604
I am Sunderraj.

2152
01:48:28,684 --> 01:48:30,366
I do some business here.

2153
01:48:30,446 --> 01:48:32,280
I do some social service as well.

2154
01:48:33,127 --> 01:48:34,100
So what?

2155
01:48:34,403 --> 01:48:37,106
Sir, Gopi is a good boy.

2156
01:48:37,186 --> 01:48:38,414
He doesn't commit crime.

2157
01:48:38,494 --> 01:48:40,122
It would be good if you leave him.

2158
01:48:41,214 --> 01:48:42,489
What are you saying?

2159
01:48:42,805 --> 01:48:44,503
I will put you inside if you speak more.

2160
01:48:46,113 --> 01:48:47,335
(Music)

2161
01:48:47,713 --> 01:48:49,962
'It's me, Home Minister speaking.'

2162
01:48:50,178 --> 01:48:53,281
'Deal with Sunderraj carefully.'

2163
01:48:53,534 --> 01:48:55,058
'He has great influence in the Center.'

2164
01:48:56,226 --> 01:48:58,172
Do you know who I am.

2165
01:48:58,561 --> 01:48:59,847
Did you get it?

2166
01:49:00,031 --> 01:49:02,615
What proof do you have
that Gopi is murderer?

2167
01:49:02,695 --> 01:49:04,094
DCP Sir,...

2168
01:49:04,174 --> 01:49:06,046
...accoding to Section 50(a),...

2169
01:49:06,126 --> 01:49:08,295
...the case details of the accused...

2170
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:10,392
...should be given to their
blood relations.

2171
01:49:10,472 --> 01:49:12,760
Or else, you have to come to court.

2172
01:49:12,937 --> 01:49:15,986
Then, listen. He murdered Purvi
very brutally.

2173
01:49:16,970 --> 01:49:20,127
He spoke to her for 45 minutes,
the day before murdering her.

2174
01:49:20,207 --> 01:49:23,564
The day after murdering her, he withdrew
40,000 rupees from her ATM card.

2175
01:49:24,655 --> 01:49:26,038
He is very arrogant.

2176
01:49:26,118 --> 01:49:28,082
He beat 10 people in Liquids Pub.

2177
01:49:31,347 --> 01:49:33,347
Is this enough? Do you need anything else?

2178
01:49:33,628 --> 01:49:36,004
Say whatever you want in the court.
Now, get out.

2179
01:49:37,507 --> 01:49:39,853
The murder accused, Gopi...

2180
01:49:39,933 --> 01:49:42,766
...has been remanded for 14 days.

2181
01:49:43,220 --> 01:49:44,420
(Music)

2182
01:49:44,604 --> 01:49:45,999
(Door opens)

2183
01:49:57,335 --> 01:49:58,600
(Music)

2184
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:09,293
What are you looking at?

2185
01:50:09,596 --> 01:50:11,585
Look down.

2186
01:50:11,665 --> 01:50:13,987
Brother is telling you to look down.

2187
01:50:14,067 --> 01:50:15,274
(Hits plate)

2188
01:50:20,885 --> 01:50:22,225
What? Will you beat me?

2189
01:50:22,305 --> 01:50:24,167
(Fights)

2190
01:50:24,773 --> 01:50:25,756
(Fights)

2191
01:50:43,726 --> 01:50:44,559
(Fights)

2192
01:50:47,542 --> 01:50:48,472
Oh.

2193
01:50:49,348 --> 01:50:50,321
Hey.

2194
01:50:51,467 --> 01:50:53,410
Hey.

2195
01:50:56,308 --> 01:50:59,259
(Music)

2196
01:51:25,786 --> 01:51:28,348
Uh-oh.

2197
01:51:28,597 --> 01:51:29,710
Oh.

2198
01:51:31,181 --> 01:51:33,332
(Ambulance sound)

2199
01:51:35,824 --> 01:51:38,787
He had a big injury on his leg and
a small injury on his head.

2200
01:51:38,867 --> 01:51:39,824
Pulse is alright.

2201
01:51:39,904 --> 01:51:42,624
He got some blood loss.

2202
01:51:42,704 --> 01:51:45,403
You can continue with the same medicine.
Yes, Sir.

2203
01:51:45,483 --> 01:51:46,296
Greetings, doctor.
Yes.

2204
01:51:46,376 --> 01:51:47,334
How is his condition?

2205
01:51:47,414 --> 01:51:49,193
Excessive bleeding. Nothing to worry.

2206
01:51:49,273 --> 01:51:50,804
How long does he need to discharge?

2207
01:51:50,884 --> 01:51:52,616
He will be discharged in 2-3 days.

2208
01:52:02,401 --> 01:52:03,374
Greetings, Sir.

2209
01:52:06,487 --> 01:52:07,352
Hmm.

2210
01:52:08,368 --> 01:52:10,844
Will you not stay calm anywhere?

2211
01:52:12,064 --> 01:52:15,610
Do you think police will just watch
if you do murders and fights?

2212
01:52:15,848 --> 01:52:18,854
Please listen to me, Sir
I think he is planning something.

2213
01:52:18,934 --> 01:52:21,729
Okay Sir.
If he does something, shoot him.

2214
01:52:24,375 --> 01:52:26,418
Deal with him carefully
until he is discharged.

2215
01:52:47,524 --> 01:52:48,518
We should kill.

2216
01:52:49,188 --> 01:52:50,410
We should kill him.

2217
01:52:51,469 --> 01:52:52,475
Hey, cigarette.

2218
01:52:57,745 --> 01:52:59,075
What did he do?

2219
01:52:59,312 --> 01:53:01,280
He is Gopi, from Amalapuram.

2220
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,993
He brutally murdered a girl named, Purvi.

2221
01:53:04,558 --> 01:53:05,574
Murder, it seems.

2222
01:53:06,439 --> 01:53:07,380
You leave.

2223
01:53:11,780 --> 01:53:14,277
Hey, if you were dare enough to murder,...

2224
01:53:14,357 --> 01:53:16,123
...you would have revert back
when we beat you.

2225
01:53:16,203 --> 01:53:18,728
So, as per our calculations,
you didn't do the murder, right?

2226
01:53:22,209 --> 01:53:24,025
Do you need any help?

2227
01:53:27,244 --> 01:53:29,904
We beat you hardly. Is it paining?
That's fine, brother.

2228
01:53:33,525 --> 01:53:36,349
Sorry, brother. We had to.
No problem.

2229
01:53:50,226 --> 01:53:51,513
Sir, Gopi escaped.

2230
01:53:52,201 --> 01:53:55,942
(Police siren)
(Gunshots)

2231
01:54:04,475 --> 01:54:05,275
(Music)

2232
01:54:09,600 --> 01:54:11,156
Oh, no.

2233
01:54:11,236 --> 01:54:12,702
That's fine.
Thanks.

2234
01:54:12,782 --> 01:54:14,454
How are you now?
I am fine.

2235
01:54:15,772 --> 01:54:17,524
Greetings, Sir.
Good morning.

2236
01:54:19,005 --> 01:54:19,978
Gopi...

2237
01:54:20,058 --> 01:54:23,298
...today we are happy,
only because of you.

2238
01:54:24,055 --> 01:54:27,201
When you are in trouble,
how can we stay away?

2239
01:54:29,752 --> 01:54:31,774
A criminal escaped from jail.
Did you see him?

2240
01:54:31,947 --> 01:54:33,767
No, Sir. We were here since two hours.

2241
01:54:33,847 --> 01:54:36,020
Shoot him on spot, if you see him.
Yes, Sir.

2242
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:38,409
(Police siren)

2243
01:54:40,236 --> 01:54:41,199
Gopi.

2244
01:54:43,907 --> 01:54:45,205
You don't worry at all.

2245
01:54:45,702 --> 01:54:46,999
Don't worry. I am here.

2246
01:54:48,988 --> 01:54:50,491
Get ready and come.
We will have breakfast.

2247
01:54:50,571 --> 01:54:51,496
Okay, Sir.

2248
01:54:53,259 --> 01:54:56,764
What is all this, Gopi? Who is that girl?
How are you trapped in this case?

2249
01:54:58,266 --> 01:55:00,547
Even I couldn't understand anything, Sir.

2250
01:55:00,627 --> 01:55:02,255
Whoever did this...

2251
01:55:02,335 --> 01:55:04,169
...he will be dead in my hands.

2252
01:55:04,249 --> 01:55:06,514
Don't get emotional, Gopi.
Not emotional, Sir.

2253
01:55:07,184 --> 01:55:08,758
He beat me on my ego.

2254
01:55:08,838 --> 01:55:10,979
The day before her marriage, the girl...

2255
01:55:11,059 --> 01:55:12,471
...spoke to you for 45 minutes.

2256
01:55:12,551 --> 01:55:13,963
I don't know all this, Sir.

2257
01:55:14,043 --> 01:55:16,466
A guy robbed my phone
in the railway station.

2258
01:55:16,546 --> 01:55:18,228
Then the day after murder...

2259
01:55:18,308 --> 01:55:21,082
...you withdrew 40,000 rupees
from her ATM card.

2260
01:55:25,128 --> 01:55:26,436
This video, Sir...

2261
01:55:26,516 --> 01:55:29,571
This is a CC camera footage from ATM.

2262
01:55:29,651 --> 01:55:31,679
One day, when I was at Ameerpet centre,...

2263
01:55:31,759 --> 01:55:33,431
...an old lady came to me...

2264
01:55:33,511 --> 01:55:34,706
...and asked to withdraw cash.

2265
01:55:34,786 --> 01:55:35,852
I did it, Sir.

2266
01:55:35,932 --> 01:55:39,343
The murderer trapped you very carefully.

2267
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:41,959
I think he knows you very well.

2268
01:55:42,402 --> 01:55:45,127
He must have some enemity in your past.

2269
01:55:45,207 --> 01:55:46,276
Try to remember.

2270
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:48,712
I don't have any enemity with anyone, Sir.

2271
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:51,739
Then why did you beat so many in the pub?

2272
01:55:54,031 --> 01:55:55,915
With you arrogant behaviour...

2273
01:55:55,995 --> 01:55:58,359
...my department concluded that...

2274
01:55:58,439 --> 01:56:00,402
...you must have committed this murder.

2275
01:56:00,482 --> 01:56:02,121
It's not my mistake, Sir.

2276
01:56:02,201 --> 01:56:04,175
They are the ones who wantedly quarelled.

2277
01:56:04,255 --> 01:56:06,457
How did you know
about the fight in the pub, Sir?

2278
01:56:06,537 --> 01:56:09,928
Some unknown person informed us
when he saw you on TV.

2279
01:56:12,219 --> 01:56:13,657
I think I am trying to
pull all the strings now

2280
01:56:13,737 --> 01:56:15,863
That day, the murderer was right there
in the pub.

2281
01:56:16,335 --> 01:56:18,681
May be, but how will you identify him?

2282
01:56:19,654 --> 01:56:21,329
I will catch him, for sure.

2283
01:56:21,409 --> 01:56:23,254
He hurt my ego.

2284
01:56:23,783 --> 01:56:25,686
I will get hold of him...

2285
01:56:25,766 --> 01:56:27,454
...and will slap his ego, Sir.

2286
01:56:30,027 --> 01:56:31,010
Gopi.

2287
01:56:31,724 --> 01:56:34,351
It's not safe for you to go outside.

2288
01:56:34,546 --> 01:56:36,178
If I stay here, I can't do anything, Sir.

2289
01:56:36,258 --> 01:56:37,767
I have to go, at any cost.

2290
01:56:38,202 --> 01:56:39,284
One minute, Gopi.

2291
01:56:39,727 --> 01:56:41,229
Gopi, take this.

2292
01:56:41,781 --> 01:56:43,284
It might lead you to any clue.

2293
01:56:43,364 --> 01:56:45,932
Use my vehicle. No one will suspect you.

2294
01:56:46,127 --> 01:56:47,846
Call me if you need anything.

2295
01:56:47,926 --> 01:56:50,146
Thank you, Sir.
Be careful, Gopi

2296
01:56:53,541 --> 01:56:57,487
(Police siren)

2297
01:57:00,857 --> 01:57:01,917
(Music)

2298
01:57:05,873 --> 01:57:07,549
Come here.

2299
01:57:07,863 --> 01:57:09,538
I am speaking to you.
Come and sit in the jeep.

2300
01:57:09,863 --> 01:57:11,408
I will not come.

2301
01:57:12,068 --> 01:57:13,581
You will not listen,
if we tell you with respect.

2302
01:57:16,554 --> 01:57:17,668
Hello DCP.

2303
01:57:18,608 --> 01:57:22,195
What are you doing?
Are you a police or a road-side romeo?

2304
01:57:22,275 --> 01:57:27,114
You are dragging a girl like an animal.

2305
01:57:27,194 --> 01:57:28,541
In which law is it written?

2306
01:57:29,427 --> 01:57:30,393
Who are you?

2307
01:57:31,139 --> 01:57:33,106
Why are you interrupting my duty?

2308
01:57:33,333 --> 01:57:35,560
I will shoot you if you do anything.

2309
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,344
What? Will you shoot me?

2310
01:57:37,993 --> 01:57:39,344
Man like you...

2311
01:57:39,625 --> 01:57:42,743
...arrested cat's mother accusing
that the cat drank milk.

2312
01:57:43,218 --> 01:57:45,986
If you are dare enough, catch the culprit.

2313
01:57:46,159 --> 01:57:50,580
Not an innocent girl like her.

2314
01:57:51,752 --> 01:57:54,347
If you keep overacting like this,...

2315
01:57:54,427 --> 01:57:56,974
...do you think public will remain calm?

2316
01:57:57,054 --> 01:57:59,266
Hey, come.
When the girl is facing difficulty...

2317
01:57:59,346 --> 01:58:00,941
...will we stay calm?
Shoot.

2318
01:58:01,021 --> 01:58:02,515
Come, shoot.

2319
01:58:02,595 --> 01:58:04,003
Police oppression...should be avoided.

2320
01:58:04,083 --> 01:58:05,743
Police oppression...should be avoided.

2321
01:58:05,823 --> 01:58:07,661
Police oppression...should be avoided.

2322
01:58:07,741 --> 01:58:12,104
If anything happens to her,
we will not move from here.

2323
01:58:12,184 --> 01:58:12,872
Hey, sit down.

2324
01:58:12,952 --> 01:58:15,099
Police thinks comedy of public.

2325
01:58:23,668 --> 01:58:25,528
(Police siren)

2326
01:58:26,198 --> 01:58:27,387
Come, daughter, we will go home.

2327
01:58:28,987 --> 01:58:30,101
Don't worry, dear.

2328
01:58:30,576 --> 01:58:32,457
I am not like DCP.

2329
01:58:32,717 --> 01:58:35,200
You don't worry. I am like your brother.

2330
01:58:35,427 --> 01:58:37,329
Come. Let's go home.

2331
01:58:41,729 --> 01:58:42,789
Start the vehicle.

2332
01:58:45,022 --> 01:58:46,622
Hey, stop.

2333
01:58:48,060 --> 01:58:49,962
Remove your helmet.
Show us your license.

2334
01:58:50,042 --> 01:58:52,189
Do you have license?
Yes, Sir.

2335
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:54,049
Hey, stop.

2336
01:58:54,528 --> 01:58:55,447
Remove your helmet.

2337
01:59:00,776 --> 01:59:03,338
Sir.
Check everyone.

2338
01:59:03,418 --> 01:59:04,474
Don't leave any area.

2339
01:59:08,192 --> 01:59:10,127
Go, go.

2340
01:59:10,207 --> 01:59:13,770
Remove the helmet.
Go, man. We have urgent work.

2341
01:59:14,495 --> 01:59:15,979
Go.

2342
01:59:19,666 --> 01:59:21,071
Remove your helmet.

2343
01:59:32,917 --> 01:59:35,717
Open it full, not half.

2344
01:59:46,754 --> 01:59:51,164
Hey, move, man.

2345
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:52,689
Uh-oh.

2346
01:59:52,769 --> 01:59:55,100
Why are you conducting meeting
in the middle of the road?

2347
01:59:55,180 --> 01:59:57,954
You hit the police. You are talking to the police.

2348
01:59:58,034 --> 02:00:01,172
You are done.
Pay fine for drink and drive.

2349
02:00:01,252 --> 02:00:02,924
Do I have to pay the fine?
Yes.

2350
02:00:03,004 --> 02:00:05,929
Me?
Yes.

2351
02:00:06,009 --> 02:00:07,313
Have this, brother.

2352
02:00:07,583 --> 02:00:08,567
(Music)

2353
02:00:09,097 --> 02:00:12,124
Show off yourselves on the culprits,...

2354
02:00:12,204 --> 02:00:15,259
...not on perfect human beings, like me.

2355
02:00:15,583 --> 02:00:16,686
Why is he spitting on me?

2356
02:00:16,766 --> 02:00:18,729
He liked your face, Sir.

2357
02:00:18,809 --> 02:00:19,909
I should not have asked you.

2358
02:00:20,277 --> 02:00:22,028
Leave all that. Give me fine.

2359
02:00:22,108 --> 02:00:23,293
Sir...

2360
02:00:23,373 --> 02:00:24,936
Read what's written there.

2361
02:00:25,877 --> 02:00:27,401
Don't mix. Drink and drive.

2362
02:00:27,481 --> 02:00:29,186
We mixed soda.

2363
02:00:29,266 --> 02:00:32,569
Mixed soda?
Is this logic enough?

2364
02:00:32,915 --> 02:00:34,148
Why is he saying logic?

2365
02:00:35,564 --> 02:00:36,688
Take out your license.

2366
02:00:36,768 --> 02:00:38,403
Do I have to take out the license?

2367
02:00:38,483 --> 02:00:40,245
Do I have to take out the license?

2368
02:00:40,325 --> 02:00:41,927
I asked you. Show me.

2369
02:00:42,007 --> 02:00:43,921
Again, assaulting again.

2370
02:00:44,001 --> 02:00:45,780
Show me your license.

2371
02:00:47,045 --> 02:00:48,159
Read it, mister.

2372
02:00:48,239 --> 02:00:49,121
(Music)

2373
02:00:49,201 --> 02:00:51,939
Driver should have license.

2374
02:00:52,019 --> 02:00:54,544
He is the driver. He has the license.

2375
02:00:54,624 --> 02:00:57,344
Come, let's go now.
Then why are you driving?

2376
02:00:57,424 --> 02:01:00,144
I was coming out of a bar.
He found me on my way.

2377
02:01:00,224 --> 02:01:03,101
He asked me to drive it.
So I am driving it. Did you get the logic?

2378
02:01:03,181 --> 02:01:04,733
Why is he saying logic?

2379
02:01:04,813 --> 02:01:06,593
Hey, stop, stop.

2380
02:01:06,673 --> 02:01:09,176
What's your problem, Sir?

2381
02:01:09,256 --> 02:01:10,452
Problem?
Yes.

2382
02:01:10,532 --> 02:01:13,804
Even Lord Brahma can't
escape for this logic.

2383
02:01:13,884 --> 02:01:15,133
Ask me.

2384
02:01:15,213 --> 02:01:17,123
Pay the fine for triple riding.
What?

2385
02:01:17,203 --> 02:01:19,587
Fine for triple riding?
Who gave you the job?

2386
02:01:19,667 --> 02:01:20,939
What did you say?

2387
02:01:21,019 --> 02:01:23,132
Where are three?
One, two, three.

2388
02:01:23,212 --> 02:01:25,932
One, two, two and a half.

2389
02:01:26,012 --> 02:01:27,543
What is two and a half?
Touch us once.

2390
02:01:28,148 --> 02:01:29,153
One.

2391
02:01:29,233 --> 02:01:30,170
Two.

2392
02:01:30,689 --> 02:01:32,360
(Music)
That's it.

2393
02:01:32,440 --> 02:01:33,398
Touch here.

2394
02:01:33,862 --> 02:01:36,771
(Music)

2395
02:01:37,571 --> 02:01:40,230
(Music)

2396
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:41,452
Why did you touch again?

2397
02:01:41,532 --> 02:01:43,268
To listen to complete song, Sir.

2398
02:01:43,348 --> 02:01:46,155
If you stay silently,
police will play with you.

2399
02:01:46,235 --> 02:01:48,684
Start your vehicles.

2400
02:01:48,764 --> 02:01:49,928
Stop.

2401
02:01:50,008 --> 02:01:52,003
Check what's going on.

2402
02:01:52,836 --> 02:01:53,896
Uh-oh.

2403
02:01:59,409 --> 02:02:01,096
Search properly.

2404
02:02:04,919 --> 02:02:05,902
Brother, give a pack.

2405
02:02:13,697 --> 02:02:16,068
Brother, give me the paper please.
Take it.

2406
02:02:16,586 --> 02:02:18,305
(Music)

2407
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:26,376
Take it, brother.

2408
02:02:28,711 --> 02:02:30,603
Hey!

2409
02:02:31,381 --> 02:02:33,316
Who are you?

2410
02:02:33,748 --> 02:02:37,349
What do you want from me?

2411
02:02:42,895 --> 02:02:43,814
Here is the file.

2412
02:02:43,894 --> 02:02:46,543
Pick pocketers, chain snatchers
in the city...

2413
02:02:46,623 --> 02:02:47,895
...all details are in this file.

2414
02:02:54,922 --> 02:02:57,030
This guy. He robbed my mobile, that day.

2415
02:02:57,507 --> 02:02:59,086
Is it him? He is a silly thief.

2416
02:02:59,166 --> 02:03:01,626
His name is Chanti, lives in Secunderabad.

2417
02:03:01,706 --> 02:03:03,183
He was caught many times.

2418
02:03:03,263 --> 02:03:05,659
He comes out on bail
and continues his robbery.

2419
02:03:05,739 --> 02:03:08,521
But he can't do murders.

2420
02:03:09,289 --> 02:03:12,727
But, Gopi, if you catch him,
you might get some clue.

2421
02:03:14,446 --> 02:03:15,365
Hey!

2422
02:03:17,116 --> 02:03:18,078
Stop.

2423
02:03:19,900 --> 02:03:20,819
Hey.

2424
02:03:21,835 --> 02:03:22,775
Stop.

2425
02:03:30,671 --> 02:03:31,417
Stop.

2426
02:03:35,017 --> 02:03:36,390
Oh, my God!

2427
02:03:48,831 --> 02:03:49,728
Hey.

2428
02:03:50,388 --> 02:03:52,096
Oh.

2429
02:03:52,669 --> 02:03:55,469
(Deep breath)

2430
02:04:01,976 --> 02:04:06,322
Brother, anyone will tie
with rope or chain.

2431
02:04:06,402 --> 02:04:08,117
But what have you done, brother.

2432
02:04:08,441 --> 02:04:09,954
You sealed with Feviquick.

2433
02:04:10,034 --> 02:04:12,696
I am not in a mood to talk to you.

2434
02:04:12,912 --> 02:04:15,496
But still I will ask you one question.

2435
02:04:15,576 --> 02:04:16,588
Tell me correctly.

2436
02:04:16,668 --> 02:04:19,485
About that mobile?
I already lost it, brother.

2437
02:04:19,565 --> 02:04:21,312
I will buy you a new mobile.

2438
02:04:21,392 --> 02:04:22,831
Please leave me, brother.

2439
02:04:22,911 --> 02:04:26,658
What did you speak to the girl
that night for 45 minutes?

2440
02:04:26,738 --> 02:04:29,263
No girl called me and I didn't
speak to anyone, brother.

2441
02:04:30,009 --> 02:04:33,378
Not like this.
Brother.

2442
02:04:33,458 --> 02:04:37,411
Brother, please don't do it.
I will tell you.

2443
02:04:38,243 --> 02:04:40,319
I got a call that midnight, brother.

2444
02:04:41,638 --> 02:04:44,812
I answered the call wondering,
who might be at this midnight.

2445
02:04:45,645 --> 02:04:48,704
From that side, voices of some boys...

2446
02:04:48,784 --> 02:04:50,726
...and screams of a girl were heard.

2447
02:04:52,164 --> 02:04:54,252
I didn't know what happened there, but...

2448
02:04:54,332 --> 02:04:57,085
...I recognised that some unusual
is happening there...

2449
02:04:57,636 --> 02:04:59,128
...and started listening to it.

2450
02:04:59,463 --> 02:05:00,641
Those boys...

2451
02:05:00,721 --> 02:05:02,760
...were scolding her...

2452
02:05:03,503 --> 02:05:05,135
...and the girl was also scolding them...

2453
02:05:05,362 --> 02:05:08,659
...after some time, she was beaten hard.

2454
02:05:08,919 --> 02:05:11,146
With a doubt that they
must have murdered her...

2455
02:05:11,226 --> 02:05:13,805
...I threw the mobile in the park.

2456
02:05:15,719 --> 02:05:17,265
I don't know anything else, brother.

2457
02:05:17,345 --> 02:05:18,627
What did they talk about?

2458
02:05:18,707 --> 02:05:20,887
I didn't understand, but...

2459
02:05:21,222 --> 02:05:23,535
...they abused her a lot.

2460
02:05:23,615 --> 02:05:27,719
If you don't answer properly,
I will pour it in your mouth.

2461
02:05:27,799 --> 02:05:30,649
Why will I lie when it is about my life?

2462
02:05:38,604 --> 02:05:42,323
Hey! Show this village guy,
the power of our city.

2463
02:05:43,696 --> 02:05:46,986
Sorry, sorry. I took your selfie
without your permission.

2464
02:05:47,699 --> 02:05:49,850
He brutally killed a girl named Purvi.

2465
02:05:50,877 --> 02:05:53,937
Can you withdraw amount from ATM please.

2466
02:05:55,158 --> 02:05:57,422
He trapped you very intelligently.

2467
02:06:04,742 --> 02:06:06,461
(Dog barks)

2468
02:06:25,783 --> 02:06:26,940
Hey, Gopi.

2469
02:06:28,508 --> 02:06:29,794
How are you?

2470
02:06:32,875 --> 02:06:34,605
I did injustice to you.

2471
02:06:34,958 --> 02:06:35,985
Truly.

2472
02:06:36,839 --> 02:06:38,698
I am sorry, Gopi.

2473
02:06:39,098 --> 02:06:40,288
I am really sorry.

2474
02:06:42,547 --> 02:06:44,461
I sent you wantedly.

2475
02:06:44,541 --> 02:06:46,150
You came for me.

2476
02:06:47,177 --> 02:06:50,799
No one can beat you in trust.
You proved it.

2477
02:06:50,983 --> 02:06:53,837
Thanks for coming to me.

2478
02:06:58,310 --> 02:06:59,748
Hey, Gopi.

2479
02:07:00,126 --> 02:07:02,624
Gopi.

2480
02:07:04,418 --> 02:07:06,105
Gopi, stop.

2481
02:07:07,209 --> 02:07:09,479
Where are you going?

2482
02:07:10,982 --> 02:07:12,020
Gopi.

2483
02:07:12,593 --> 02:07:13,749
Where are you going?

2484
02:07:14,463 --> 02:07:15,825
Hey Tomy. Come and sleep.

2485
02:07:22,798 --> 02:07:24,171
Hey, brother. It's you.

2486
02:07:24,452 --> 02:07:25,761
How do you know her?

2487
02:07:25,841 --> 02:07:26,679
Brother...

2488
02:07:26,759 --> 02:07:28,521
You gave me thousand rupees that day.

2489
02:07:28,601 --> 02:07:31,299
I got it treated with that money.

2490
02:07:37,007 --> 02:07:37,948
Thank you, dear.

2491
02:07:39,766 --> 02:07:41,950
Then she took a selfie with me.

2492
02:07:42,706 --> 02:07:44,231
Do you know anything about her?

2493
02:07:44,311 --> 02:07:45,712
I don't know, brother.

2494
02:07:47,031 --> 02:07:48,151
Please, think of it.

2495
02:07:48,231 --> 02:07:49,957
Anything about her, please tell me.

2496
02:07:51,481 --> 02:07:52,800
Tell me, dear.

2497
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:54,973
That day, at Jubilee Hills check post...

2498
02:07:55,384 --> 02:07:56,962
Please tell me.

2499
02:07:57,222 --> 02:07:58,281
Please tell me.

2500
02:07:58,769 --> 02:08:01,947
Please.
I met her at Jubilee Hills check post.

2501
02:08:06,444 --> 02:08:08,779
(Music)

2502
02:08:08,859 --> 02:08:10,368
I don't know when this nonsense
comes to an end.

2503
02:08:12,746 --> 02:08:14,216
Take this. Take this.

2504
02:08:15,849 --> 02:08:17,968
Hey Nani.
Is that you, sister?

2505
02:08:18,048 --> 02:08:20,270
Why are you here?
Give me money, sister.

2506
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:23,177
Why money? What is this?
Signal will be on again.

2507
02:08:23,257 --> 02:08:25,382
I will park aside. Come.
Okay sister.

2508
02:08:28,524 --> 02:08:31,292
(Music)

2509
02:08:33,757 --> 02:08:36,776
Without seeing the number properly,
I gave her the packet..

2510
02:08:36,981 --> 02:08:39,598
Sorry, sister. It was by mistake
that I gave you.

2511
02:08:39,678 --> 02:08:40,700
What is this packet?

2512
02:08:40,780 --> 02:08:44,960
Everyday, three brothers come and
give me these packets and cards.

2513
02:08:45,165 --> 02:08:47,251
To the vehicle numbers matching
that on the card...

2514
02:08:47,331 --> 02:08:50,272
...we handover the packets and
they give us money in return.

2515
02:08:50,352 --> 02:08:52,218
Who else do they give these packets to?

2516
02:08:52,298 --> 02:08:54,110
Some of us, sister.

2517
02:08:54,190 --> 02:08:55,493
Where are your guys now?

2518
02:08:55,573 --> 02:08:57,950
Like me, they stand at
different signals, sister.

2519
02:08:58,030 --> 02:08:59,388
How do we recognise them?

2520
02:08:59,468 --> 02:09:01,928
Our shirt collar would be raised, sister.

2521
02:09:02,008 --> 02:09:04,263
Oh, okay. Give me all the packets.

2522
02:09:04,343 --> 02:09:05,842
No. Brothers will beat me.

2523
02:09:06,155 --> 02:09:07,247
They will not say anything.

2524
02:09:07,587 --> 02:09:10,831
Take this money and give me those packets.

2525
02:09:12,539 --> 02:09:14,917
Don't tell anyone that
I gave you the packets.

2526
02:09:14,997 --> 02:09:15,977
I will not tell anyone.

2527
02:09:27,640 --> 02:09:29,521
(Music)

2528
02:09:29,601 --> 02:09:31,789
(Music)

2529
02:09:31,869 --> 02:09:33,069
(Music)

2530
02:09:45,035 --> 02:09:46,170
(Music)

2531
02:09:54,471 --> 02:09:57,477
Customers are calling and saying that
they didn't get the stock.

2532
02:09:57,557 --> 02:10:00,309
Same call from Kukatpally, Ameerpet
and Dilshukhnagar.

2533
02:10:00,389 --> 02:10:02,288
Customers are calling and torturing.

2534
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:04,266
What happened to the stock then?

2535
02:10:04,346 --> 02:10:05,801
I didn't understand what is going on.

2536
02:10:05,881 --> 02:10:07,682
Something is happening in the city.

2537
02:10:09,258 --> 02:10:10,458
Find it out.

2538
02:10:17,961 --> 02:10:19,385
Disconnect the call.

2539
02:11:25,767 --> 02:11:27,507
I am Sunderraj.

2540
02:11:27,587 --> 02:11:29,339
I do business here.

2541
02:11:29,419 --> 02:11:31,025
I do social service also.

2542
02:11:31,105 --> 02:11:33,112
Leave those drugs, guys.

2543
02:11:33,371 --> 02:11:34,485
What is in that?

2544
02:11:37,481 --> 02:11:39,611
Hey! Leave me.

2545
02:11:40,206 --> 02:11:43,330
Or else I will take you to the police.

2546
02:11:44,195 --> 02:11:46,411
Her's is boiling blood.

2547
02:11:46,789 --> 02:11:50,240
First you need to get out of here,
to get me caught.

2548
02:11:50,320 --> 02:11:51,830
I need not go anywhere.

2549
02:11:51,910 --> 02:11:53,570
They will come here.
Is it?

2550
02:11:54,262 --> 02:11:55,257
How?

2551
02:11:56,089 --> 02:11:58,992
How will they come?
Let me show you.

2552
02:11:59,072 --> 02:12:00,473
I will call the police right away.

2553
02:12:00,553 --> 02:12:01,478
(Slaps)

2554
02:12:11,007 --> 02:12:13,158
Hey! Don't you have sense?

2555
02:12:13,238 --> 02:12:15,894
Even if you stop me,
you can't stop the truth.

2556
02:12:16,304 --> 02:12:21,784
Since you are a girl, we are not hurting
you much. But you are acting smart.

2557
02:12:21,864 --> 02:12:24,151
Do you think that death is a joke?

2558
02:12:24,746 --> 02:12:25,989
At signal lights,...

2559
02:12:26,069 --> 02:12:30,076
...don't you feel shame for
making kids do that work?

2560
02:12:30,156 --> 02:12:31,384
What a waste of life.

2561
02:12:31,579 --> 02:12:33,882
Why wait till you kill me?

2562
02:12:33,962 --> 02:12:35,309
I will kill you.

2563
02:12:35,389 --> 02:12:36,541
(Beats with rod)

2564
02:12:39,756 --> 02:12:42,664
Take her away and bury her.

2565
02:12:44,675 --> 02:12:48,102
She called someone and
made them listen everything.

2566
02:12:48,916 --> 02:12:50,192
I think this is some risk.

2567
02:13:00,841 --> 02:13:01,965
(Music)

2568
02:13:02,376 --> 02:13:03,716
(Music)

2569
02:13:08,726 --> 02:13:11,256
(Music)
Brother, he is Gopi, from Amalapuram.

2570
02:13:11,336 --> 02:13:12,867
He is very arrogant, brother.

2571
02:13:12,947 --> 02:13:14,651
He beat some guys in a pub.

2572
02:13:44,340 --> 02:13:46,058
(Police siren)

2573
02:13:48,567 --> 02:13:50,361
Come Sir.
Move away.

2574
02:13:50,916 --> 02:13:52,083
She was killed very brutally.

2575
02:13:53,251 --> 02:13:55,208
Did you find any clues?
Not yet, Sir.

2576
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:57,575
(Music)

2577
02:14:24,097 --> 02:14:25,957
(Police siren)

2578
02:14:29,773 --> 02:14:31,330
Come, Sir.

2579
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:32,681
Sir.

2580
02:14:33,072 --> 02:14:34,337
Please wait there.

2581
02:14:35,602 --> 02:14:38,056
Any clues?
She was murdered brutally.

2582
02:14:38,136 --> 02:14:39,396
At a little distance from here...

2583
02:14:39,476 --> 02:14:41,256
...We found her handbag and
mobile phone, Sir.

2584
02:14:41,526 --> 02:14:43,288
Last dial number was boy friend, Sir.

2585
02:14:43,368 --> 02:14:45,454
The call record was 45 minutes, Sir.

2586
02:14:45,534 --> 02:14:47,519
There is a selfie in gallery,
taken with her boy friend, Sir.

2587
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:49,638
His profile pic and the one
in selfie are same, Sir.

2588
02:14:49,962 --> 02:14:51,530
Definitely, he is the murderer, Sir.

2589
02:14:51,610 --> 02:14:53,865
His mobile is switched off, Sir.

2590
02:14:53,945 --> 02:14:56,070
We started with the primary
investigation, Sir.

2591
02:14:56,150 --> 02:14:58,697
Okay. Let's see if we get any other clue.

2592
02:14:58,777 --> 02:15:01,389
We have to catch the murderer in 24 hours.
Sir.

2593
02:15:01,469 --> 02:15:03,378
I will consider this case
very prestigiously, Sir.

2594
02:15:03,458 --> 02:15:04,644
I will catch the murderer soon, Sir.

2595
02:15:04,724 --> 02:15:05,628
Okay, go ahead.

2596
02:15:05,708 --> 02:15:07,790
We got some clues for now.

2597
02:15:07,870 --> 02:15:10,936
Once post mortem is done,
we might get other clues as well.

2598
02:15:11,016 --> 02:15:13,790
Till then, please don't telecast
any gossips.

2599
02:15:13,870 --> 02:15:14,774
Please.

2600
02:15:15,420 --> 02:15:17,323
Do you know where they are, now?

2601
02:15:17,403 --> 02:15:18,133
I know, brother.

2602
02:15:22,469 --> 02:15:25,485
That village guy has escaped
from jail and raising tension.

2603
02:15:26,289 --> 02:15:29,500
Once I get hold of him,
I will kill him there itself.

2604
02:15:45,093 --> 02:15:47,179
Hey!
(Bottle breaks)

2605
02:15:47,525 --> 02:15:48,682
(Bottle breaks)

2606
02:15:48,762 --> 02:15:49,936
My God!

2607
02:16:03,491 --> 02:16:04,853
What are you waiting for?

2608
02:16:18,913 --> 02:16:19,788
Hey!

2609
02:16:22,859 --> 02:16:23,832
(Screams)

2610
02:16:46,338 --> 02:16:47,571
(Screams)

2611
02:16:59,229 --> 02:17:00,916
Hey, here.

2612
02:17:05,124 --> 02:17:06,140
(Screams)

2613
02:17:10,951 --> 02:17:11,999
(Rain sound)

2614
02:17:15,030 --> 02:17:15,873
(Rain sound)

2615
02:17:28,515 --> 02:17:31,607
I already have the tag
that I am a murderer.

2616
02:17:31,834 --> 02:17:33,921
I don't want that tag to be true.

2617
02:17:36,785 --> 02:17:38,839
Nani, get up.

2618
02:17:39,033 --> 02:17:41,217
Nani, Nani.

2619
02:17:41,297 --> 02:17:42,450
Oh.

2620
02:17:46,900 --> 02:17:50,089
Brother, we got him. We beat him to death.

2621
02:17:50,360 --> 02:17:52,997
He is breathing his last.
Shall we kill him?

2622
02:17:59,948 --> 02:18:00,931
(Music)

2623
02:18:07,746 --> 02:18:11,465
We saw him in the Ameerpet centre.
He doesn't seem to know the matter.

2624
02:18:11,919 --> 02:18:12,914
He is cool.

2625
02:18:13,173 --> 02:18:16,250
Make him use the ATM card, somehow.

2626
02:18:16,330 --> 02:18:17,256
Grandma.

2627
02:18:18,315 --> 02:18:19,299
Take this money.

2628
02:18:19,379 --> 02:18:22,488
Go to him and ask him to draw
the money through this ATM card.

2629
02:18:28,321 --> 02:18:30,342
You made it difficult to breathe.

2630
02:18:30,422 --> 02:18:33,607
Now I will see how you will breathe.

2631
02:18:36,729 --> 02:18:39,194
20 years of my kingdom...

2632
02:18:39,453 --> 02:18:41,605
...you tried to bury it in 20 minutes...

2633
02:18:41,842 --> 02:18:46,236
...how did you think it?

2634
02:18:46,582 --> 02:18:50,777
I invited you in the park. Do you think
it was for chit chat with you?

2635
02:18:51,068 --> 02:18:52,366
To kill you.

2636
02:18:52,446 --> 02:18:56,312
Your time was good and you escaped.
Where will you go today?

2637
02:18:56,564 --> 02:18:58,078
You are a villager.

2638
02:18:58,158 --> 02:19:00,888
If you have so much ego,...

2639
02:19:01,742 --> 02:19:05,386
I eat city food.
What range of ego would I have?

2640
02:19:05,667 --> 02:19:09,839
Thought you are a villager, doesn't know
much, so trapped you in that case.

2641
02:19:09,919 --> 02:19:11,882
You are a very talented guy.

2642
02:19:12,844 --> 02:19:16,952
I was calmly doing my drug business.

2643
02:19:17,032 --> 02:19:19,444
Why are you guys coming to my business?

2644
02:19:19,524 --> 02:19:23,066
I will leave you if you come to me...

2645
02:19:23,260 --> 02:19:26,266
...but if you come to my business,
I will bury you down.

2646
02:19:26,612 --> 02:19:29,211
She came and died.

2647
02:19:29,503 --> 02:19:32,692
What about you from village?

2648
02:19:32,772 --> 02:19:34,184
To get me arrested?

2649
02:19:34,264 --> 02:19:37,611
Get me arrested now.

2650
02:19:39,344 --> 02:19:42,058
He would have lived for few days,
if he was in jail.

2651
02:19:42,138 --> 02:19:44,004
What could you do coming out now?

2652
02:19:44,084 --> 02:19:46,209
You are dying in my hands now.

2653
02:19:47,247 --> 02:19:48,231
This guy...

2654
02:19:49,632 --> 02:19:54,054
For my anger, not killing him,
something else...

2655
02:19:54,134 --> 02:19:55,567
...I want to do something else.
(Gunshot)

2656
02:19:55,805 --> 02:19:57,265
(Gunshot)

2657
02:20:05,668 --> 02:20:06,857
Don't move.

2658
02:20:07,873 --> 02:20:08,903
Surrender yourself.

2659
02:20:08,983 --> 02:20:11,454
Don't shoot me. I will surrender.

2660
02:20:11,534 --> 02:20:13,357
I will surrender, DCP. Don't shoot.

2661
02:20:13,951 --> 02:20:15,973
I lately came to know Gopi's innocense.

2662
02:20:16,265 --> 02:20:19,214
Purvi couriered me all your details.

2663
02:20:19,581 --> 02:20:22,403
I know that I can catch you
if I follow Gopi.

2664
02:20:23,679 --> 02:20:25,949
My guess was perfect.

2665
02:20:26,543 --> 02:20:29,391
You played dramas in the station.

2666
02:20:31,348 --> 02:20:34,018
Do you think public will stare?

2667
02:20:34,098 --> 02:20:35,207
Come, dear. Let's go home.

2668
02:20:35,499 --> 02:20:38,245
I will kill her.

2669
02:20:38,449 --> 02:20:40,363
DCP, throw away the gun.

2670
02:20:40,698 --> 02:20:42,482
Throw it.

2671
02:20:42,947 --> 02:20:44,417
Get out.

2672
02:20:45,941 --> 02:20:47,531
Throw it.

2673
02:20:48,298 --> 02:20:49,390
Throw it.

2674
02:20:49,792 --> 02:20:52,311
Go away.

2675
02:20:57,770 --> 02:20:59,176
(Gunshot)

2676
02:21:02,691 --> 02:21:03,848
(Man falls down)

2677
02:21:25,980 --> 02:21:26,769
Come.

2678
02:21:31,257 --> 02:21:33,949
Sir, I followed Gopi in Purvi case
and caught the culprits.

2679
02:21:34,825 --> 02:21:37,463
When they opened fire,
I had to encounter them, Sir.

2680
02:21:38,051 --> 02:21:39,045
Okay, Sir.

2681
02:21:45,240 --> 02:21:48,710
In Purvi's murder case, as per
the proofs submitted by the police,...

2682
02:21:49,033 --> 02:21:51,423
...court is convinced that
Gopi is innocent.

2683
02:21:51,768 --> 02:21:55,368
But since he escaped from
jail during remand...

2684
02:21:55,617 --> 02:21:58,450
...Gopi has to be jailed for 7 days.

2685
02:22:15,333 --> 02:22:17,635
You all...

2686
02:22:17,862 --> 02:22:19,549
(Laughs)

2687
02:22:20,153 --> 02:22:21,137
(Laughs)

2688
02:22:21,667 --> 02:22:22,932
(Music)

2689
02:22:23,012 --> 02:22:25,115
Dad, you both?

2690
02:22:25,753 --> 02:22:28,953
He left his son for
the sake of my daughter.

2691
02:22:29,191 --> 02:22:32,222
Can't I leave my ego for him?

2692
02:22:32,302 --> 02:22:33,789
(Smiles)

2693
02:22:39,887 --> 02:22:41,119
One selfie please.

2694
02:22:42,114 --> 02:22:45,087
Who will you share with
when the whole village is here?

2695
02:22:45,167 --> 02:22:47,303
(Laughs)

2696
02:22:47,671 --> 02:22:50,395
My Venkatlakshmi is safe now.

2697
02:22:50,475 --> 02:22:51,879
(Laughs)

2698
02:23:18,421 --> 02:23:24,639
â™ªThere is a talk that this guy is perfect
with jet speed and like a rocket.â™ª
