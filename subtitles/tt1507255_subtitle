1
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,327
Run!
' Run!

2
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,766
Look there.

3
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,160
There it goes.

4
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:37,538
Idiots.
Careful on the street!

5
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,680
He bumped with the girl.
I should bump with her instead of him.

6
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,022
MY pend rive!

7
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:55,185
Wait!

8
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:02,564
My pend rive!
Wait!

9
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,093
I'm scared!

10
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,773
Run!

11
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,617
Sis, make a move.

12
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,018
You all sure will
get killed by the bus.

13
00:02:45,064 --> 00:02:46,338
Greetings, bro.

14
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,804
Don't let it go.

15
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:58,019
The water is overﬂowing.
- Can see, right!

16
00:02:58,144 --> 00:02:59,122
Why can't you
help me to lift this.

17
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,030
Only her you will help,
what about us?

18
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,999
Let me go, Kumar!

19
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,767
Why disturbing me when don't
know what is happening here!

20
00:03:17,063 --> 00:03:19,600
Rainier is going!
- Railing? Where?

21
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,710
There he goes!

22
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,412
Is it his movie's shooting?
- Yes, let me go!

23
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,314
Look, Rainier is here.
Sure do Dishware too.

24
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,511
I can see you anytime,
but only can see her sometimes.

25
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,020
I go and see her first.
You wash and keep this container.

26
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:34,455
Hey, Rainier and Dishware Ra are here.
- Rainier?

27
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,385
Move!

28
00:03:39,619 --> 00:03:40,723
Wait for me!

29
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,199
I know Rainier earlier!

30
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:46,761
He sure only
want to meet me.

31
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,268
Iron and keep it for me.

32
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:52,438
Where are they running to?

33
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,066
You the one who loose it!
Go and get it.

34
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,008
I am talented in climbing.
It's nothing for me.

35
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,741
Where is Rainier?
- There he is.

36
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:39,986
Is that Rainier?
- Ya, he is.

37
00:04:40,179 --> 00:04:41,590
You can ask anyone.

38
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,155
Should beat myself
up for listening to you.

39
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,630
I just managed to get a girl,
after for long tries.

40
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:51,668
Even that you have spoil it!
You ran because of this?!

41
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:57,031
It's not a normal kite,
I have won many times with this.

42
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,007
It's a lucky kite.

43
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,002
Move!
Where is the shooting?

44
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:04,979
Where is Rainier?
- Where is the shooting?

45
00:05:05,204 --> 00:05:08,083
Who told you that?
- Kumar did told us.

46
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:12,144
Why you did this, Kumar?
Do you think they have no work as you?

47
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,024
Why are you doing this?!
- Curse you.

48
00:05:15,214 --> 00:05:19,424
Why are you here?
- I came to see.

49
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,124
You need to see
in this age!

50
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,516
How many times to tell you!
Remove you trouser.

51
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,382
How to remove the trouser
if you wear the belt so tight!

52
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,325
You want to remove my trouser?
It's yours.

53
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,414
Remove it!

54
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,222
I didn't wear any underwear.
It will be shameful.

55
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:53,456
I don't care about your problem!
Remove it!

56
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,227
Even he knows.

57
00:05:56,322 --> 00:06:01,499
Why is he using 'leg' in his speech?
- He's not law and order police.

58
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:02,504
He's a 'leg' and order police!

59
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:08,007
Are you teasing my Tamil?
We're using the correct ones.

60
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:11,605
Is it a proper Tamil
that you pol are using?

61
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,374
Even you changed 'mom'
word to vulgar word!

62
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:18,114
That is superb. I even like the
Madurai Tamil that you're using.

63
00:06:18,244 --> 00:06:20,087
The Tamil I'm using is not belongs to
Madurai, it's Machiavelli’s Tamil.

64
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,420
You idiot!

65
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,994
You gathered all young kids
and making havoc in city?

66
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,990
<i>I will</i> beat you up!

67
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,034
Sir, don't scold our boss.
- Boss?

68
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,198
So you're the gang leader?
- No, I'm not, sir!

69
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:37,240
They are simply telling that!
I'm really a good person.

70
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:38,671
Even my uncle is in
the Commissioner's office.

71
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,006
In Commissioner's office?

72
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,046
As what?
- As a offender in the investigation.

73
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,209
Stand up!

74
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:47,545
Remove your trouser.

75
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,044
I don't mind even you're naked.
Remove it!

76
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,117
I don't mind standing naked.
It will so awful. Is it OK?

77
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:58,388
Even now you look awful too!
Remove it!

78
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:01,922
Pol are standing.

79
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,972
You're wearing underwear!
So you were lying to me!

80
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,700
What a big lie I have told?!
All this happened because of them.

81
00:07:15,001 --> 00:07:17,277
They told there is Rani’s
shooting going on.

82
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,508
I didn't teach them anything!

83
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,014
My boss is telling lies again.

84
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:26,724
He taught us even to catch kite or
the snake, we shouldn't run straight.

85
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:28,484
So he brought us to a short cut.

86
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,025
He's lying!
I don't even know how to do hair cut!

87
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:38,759
Why are you doing this!
Can't you stop it!

88
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:41,001
My mom did told me.
- About what?

89
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,969
Don't buy underwear
that I'm wearing now.

90
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:46,600
Police like those,
they will remove it once they saw it!

91
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:48,137
Look after them.

92
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:59,546
You are fashion tech student!
And lost a pen drive like a small kid!

93
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,390
I didn't aspect this.
- You have been doing this for 6 months.

94
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:06,929
And you're telling you just save the work
on pen drive and formatted your laptop!

95
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,158
A DVD only cost Plop.
Shouldn't you keep few copies?

96
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,165
Even this I need to tell!

97
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,468
So I format it..
- I can't accept any of your excuses.

98
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,466
If you can't send it in.
You just extend to next year.

99
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,003
I'm late for my class.

100
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,078
Did it with using a lots of references.
Didn't think that this will happen.

101
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,318
Sure he took it!
- Who?

102
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,222
The one who bumped on us.
A buffalo.

103
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,422
On you!
- Ya, on me.

104
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:41,988
Must be with him.

105
00:08:42,088 --> 00:08:43,999
How can it go there
to him from you?

106
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,069
It can.
- How can it be?

107
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,970
Think and see.
It can be.

108
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,134
Ya, could be right.

109
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,115
Must get the pen drive from him!

110
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,918
Should I penned down the pending
cell phone stolen case on him?

111
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,389
He looks like an idiot.

112
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,718
You're telling just put that case on him.

113
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:11,518
Do add on about the rape case
of 60 years old lady.

114
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:16,657
Raped a 60 years old lady?!
- She was 30 years when get rapped.

115
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:21,165
It is a 30 years case.
- Put the murder case too.

116
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,366
Kumar!
- Bro, come.

117
00:09:25,498 --> 00:09:26,636
Sit.

118
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:34,418
Why accusing them for all
the things they didn't do?

119
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:37,951
Why asking them to stand as
in Malayalam movie posters.

120
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,114
I was waiting for arrival.

121
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:41,380
They are doing this because
of you backing them.

122
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:43,221
They will change once I put
them in for four days.

123
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:44,760
Take it easy.
They are still studying.

124
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:46,428
Simply get tensed
because of light things.

125
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,198
Did they murdered anyone?
It just for a while.

126
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,167
Once they went for work,
everything will be fine.

127
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,568
You're taking it so lightly.

128
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:58,765
They have broken up
so many things.

129
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:03,536
They're doing all
kind of stupid stuff.

130
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,616
Where on earth
they will repent!

131
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,445
Look at the over aged person.

132
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,109
Will they repent when still
hanging around with him!

133
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:16,721
This station use to kept in all the
most wanted criminals named Kumar.

134
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,230
But you're holding this useless Kumar.

135
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,663
Look here!
Behave well after this.

136
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,606
If you do it again.
They will beat you and jail you all in!

137
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:34,040
Then I won't come for you all.

138
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:36,146
This is what you keep on
telling for many times.

139
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:37,372
That's why these
kids keep on doing this.

140
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,108
Let them go.

141
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:41,013
Lucky me, they don't
keep me here for long.

142
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:42,085
OK, let us go!

143
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:43,778
You don't go first.

144
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:46,056
Why do I need to stay?
I came with them too.

145
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,752
They are still studying, so they can and
you are wordless so just stay here.

146
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,753
He likes you so much.
So just spend time for a while here.

147
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:56,493
Do you think this is an
entertainment place to spend timel?

148
00:10:56,622 --> 00:10:59,102
Bring me together, or no
votes from my house for you.

149
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:00,397
Won't you vote me?
- No, I won't!

150
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:01,630
Then what is the use of
your fingers?

151
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:06,073
He will be here right?
Do break his fingers.

152
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:20,217
Off the radio!

153
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,722
Just making me more upset.

154
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,996
Look at Kumar,
so mad!

155
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,325
Ya, he is.

156
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,156
We will meet again.
- Go back home safely.

157
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,097
Thanks a lot to send us back.

158
00:11:33,225 --> 00:11:34,795
Be careful with the money.

159
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,732
However it will be
finished in an hour.

160
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:38,137
Then what is the worries.

161
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:43,339
As usual you have won. Those who
lost surely have revenge on you.

162
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,007
You go back carefully. Kumar will take
care if anything happen to us.

163
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:50,053
If you born in Gujarat.
Sure you have become rich by this talent.

164
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,247
Kumar, take care of them.

165
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,587
Are you sad?

166
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,160
Why it looks like your
left is swollen?

167
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,362
Did Inspector beat you?
- No, he indulged me.

168
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,037
You left me behind right!
- Not like that.

169
00:12:10,129 --> 00:12:12,541
We want to wait, but Seth
brought us to the com petition.

170
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:17,102
While police whacking me, so you
went to have fun at the competition!

171
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,011

173
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,020
Did I listen to him?
I befriend with you all right.

174
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:26,215
That's why you all sent
me to police station.

175
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,121
So what is the problem?
You won't befriend with us?

176
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,727
How many times to tell.
Go away, need to wash the place!

177
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,454
Leave it then.
That's all you luck is.

178
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,064
What is the luck?

179
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,624
Why is the door not locked?

180
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:02,064
Mom, I still have space in my tummy.
Pls give something and full it.

181
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,725
Mom, come fast.
- What is the time now?

182
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,192
Only now you're coming back?
Did you see your dad?

183
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,936
He's disappeared?
Thanks for that.

184
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,410
Pls don't do any reports to police.
Then they will find him.

185
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,946
He was waiting for you all this
while in front of our house.

186
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:20,517
He's not there.
Only a dustbin is there.

187
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:21,950
You rascal!

188
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,021
Why is the dustbin talking?
- Curse you!

189
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:26,988
Do I look like a dustbin?
- Its dad!

190
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,184
Why are you look like this?

191
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,226
You are like actor
Arjun in one of his movie.

192
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:34,354
Of coz you will tease me.
How I suffered to give you educations.

193
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:37,968
Why are you laughing?
- What else to do.

194
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,033
Even its a lie,
tell lie logically.

195
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,105
Can be accept when you said
you suffered with anything else,

196
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,070
But lying you suffered
by not eating!

197
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:48,136
I'm scolding him right!
And why are you giving him the food!

198
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:50,178
He's only listening to
your scolding right.

199
00:17:50,269 --> 00:17:52,146
But his mouth and
hand is free right.

200
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:53,147
You're a mom.

201
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:58,014
Always worried I have eaten or not.

202
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,181
That's why I will call
her 'attha' with love.

203
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:01,450
And me?

204
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,085
You useless.
When you will be useful in life?

205
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,289
What should I do by being useful?

206
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:11,600
You have been feeding me for 25 years.

207
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,999
Just get me a girl who is
working and marry me to her.

208
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,596
And then she will look
after me for 15 years.

209
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:18,730
By then all my kids
will start working.

210
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:21,102
Then they will take care of me.

211
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,109
How is it?

212
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:25,071
Come here!

213
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,110
As if he bought the TV.

214
00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:28,513
We get this free
from government.

215
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,985
I was asking you
to buy me an auto.

216
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:34,523
If you did bought me an auto,
I might be someone by now.

217
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,618
But instead of that you
bought me fish carriage trishaw.

218
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:43,022
Even that you can't pay the rental.
And I'm paying it monthly!

219
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,624
And by this attitude
you need an auto?!

220
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:48,294
After all this humiliation,
I don't want eat your food!

221
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,963
I don't want eat anything!

222
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:52,198
Egg!

223
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:59,513
Dad, we shouldn't show anger on food.

224
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:01,983
He have changed his
topic once saw the egg.

225
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:03,485
Eat well!

226
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,999
How you suppose to
wake up in the morning,

227
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:29,477
When you come back late
night and sleep.

228
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,104
You are a useless kid!

229
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:34,211
Can't wake you up like this!
Here I come!

230
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:38,481
You keep on taking advantage
just because I'm keeping quite!

231
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:40,416
Wake up!

232
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:46,524
Useless kid!
Wake up!

233
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:50,228
Don't keep on cursing me in the
same words. Think something new.

234
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,426
And curse me later.
I will continue sleeping till then.

235
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,300
You want continue sleeping?
- What else to do in this age?!

236
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:59,171
Go and see outer world! All the
younger kids achieving a lot of things.

237
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:00,971
But see how useless you are.
- Go away.

238
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,305
The expenses breaking coconuts
at the temple,

239
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,543
For you to pass is more than
the school fees itself.

240
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,177
You putting your expenses to buy
coconut for your stall on me, right?

241
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,050
Why won't you tell.

242
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:19,059
My mistake to take care of you
well even without your father.

243
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:23,395
You father died after he was
so busy with his political life.

244
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:26,367
And you'rejoining with all the
useless kids and playing with kites!

245
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:29,268
Won't you stop cursing!
Pack my breakfast. I need to go to school.

246
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:34,774
I thought you will bring back certs.
But you wasting time on kites.

247
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,236
Don't kill me by nagging!
Need to go to school.

248
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:41,580
Am I killing you?
You're the one will send me earlier!

249
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,620
I didn't ask you to be a big officer.
Just want you to live in a good life.

250
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,187
Is it wrong?
- Why are you crying now!

251
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:53,557
Keep crying for everything.

252
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:57,794
Only good soul will cry.
Good ppl will cry.

253
00:20:58,323 --> 00:21:02,999
Have you cried once?
- What's wrong with you?!

254
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:07,009
Are you ready? - Give me
ten minutes, I'll take my bath.

255
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:09,239

261
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,605

Such an idiot.

268
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,055
Brushing teeth at this time.

269
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,093
We're leaving bro.

270

He will get after this.
- They simply framed me.

271
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,064
Why they need to frame you?
You will know if you entered school.

272
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,501
I did pass my school.
- What use passing the school?

273

Why are you asking this.
He got tensed with me in the morning itself.

Must catch him some how.

Why are you keep on asking

00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,257
Why are you touching all this!
Don't you have a brain!

338
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,492
Go out!
- Are you chasing me out!

339
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:04,965
If you come near,
I will remove your towel!

340
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:06,294
You want that!

341
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,235
Who is she?
What is happening here!

342
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:10,396
Nothing mom.

343
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,943
You bad attitude have
come to this level?! - Don't talk like that.

344
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:17,036
He's a thief!
He stole my pen drive.

345
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,471
You insane!
- He stole it!

346
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:20,641
<i>No mom.</i>

347
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,616
I thought you just
wondering around useless,

348
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,112
Now you started to
stealing things.

349
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:25,983
No mom, she's insane.
Why are you believing her!

350
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,521
You thieﬂ Why is she asking
if you didn't steal her thing!

351
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:30,958
Get lost!

352
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:35,360
What I don't want to happen
is happened! - Listen to me.

353
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:38,090
You have spoiled your father's
name. What should I do?

354
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,368
No one to hear my problem?

355
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,467
Maliga, come here!
- Keep quite, mom!

356
00:27:44,596 --> 00:27:47,076
Nothing happened.
What is the problem sis?

357
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,336
Come down.

358
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,604
Nothing happened.
- You always tell me he is a good kid.

359
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:55,683
Do you what he have done?
Come down! Why are you still there!

360
00:27:56,408 --> 00:27:59,048
Everybody is watching this!
Let them.

361
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,582
What is the matter?
Who is she?

362
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:06,326
Do you know what he did?
He have stolen things!

363
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,659
Who? our Ramesh?
Are you insane? -Tell her!

364
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:10,999
Keep quite!

365
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:13,535
Who is insane?
He stole something from her.

366
00:28:13,725 --> 00:28:16,137
And she came in the house
and talking bad things in English!

367
00:28:16,461 --> 00:28:18,532
My respect and dignity is gone!
- Ramesh, your reputation is sinking..

368
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:21,371
Why are you always with your mom...
- He have come!

369
00:28:21,566 --> 00:28:22,704
Why are you beating me?

370
00:28:23,068 --> 00:28:25,708
Because of you my son have spoiled.
Why are you here now?

371
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,008
Do you think he's a small kid,
and blaming me for his actions!

372
00:28:29,107 --> 00:28:30,984
Stop it! Now I want
my pen drive back!

373
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:32,214
Better give me back!

374
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:34,048
Why are you making
a havoc just for a pen?

375
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:35,986
Pen?
Its a pen drive.

376
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:37,958
Pen is a pen right?

377
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,553
You can tell he didn't give the
kites as he promised in a competition.

378
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,359
I agree.
But if you accused him as thieﬂ

379
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,492
I will punch your face!
- Stop it!

380
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:47,592
I want my pen drive back!
Give it back!

381
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,501
You think you can talk anything
because we're low class!

382
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,268
Do you brave enough to go like
this to Anna nagar, or Bessa nagar.

383
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:53,273
They will make you suffer!

384
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,674
Look here!
I didn't talk about low or high class.

385
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:57,212
What I need is my six months project!

386
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,373
We don't care whether
you are six or ten months!

387
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,643
He didn't stole yourthings.
That's all.

388
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,047
He took it!

389
00:29:02,173 --> 00:29:04,016
I'm watching you.
You are too much!

390
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,519
You will get whack from me!

391
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,180
Pls don't scold her.
She's a bit mess in head.

392
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:10,623
So she's a mental case?
- Mental? Me?!

393
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:12,126
Let's leave this place.

394
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:15,695
No Pooja, he's telling me mental..
- We must go back home safely.

395
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,261
No need send her home,
send her to mental hospital.

396
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,691
Yes, even her house is there.
- So even her family is there.

397
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,434
Tell me the truth.
You did stole things from her right?

398
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:28,573
Kumar bring Ramesh and go.
If he stays here, she will torture him.

399
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,680
Its not new for her to torture him.

400
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,716
You useless!
Go!

401
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,578
Only now I aware why your
father passed away at young age.

402
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,053
Curse you!
- Change your clothes and come faster!

403
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:46,086
I try to get it today.

404
00:29:46,217 --> 00:29:48,219
The thing you can't get in two days,
you think can get it in a half day!

405
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,226
I can't allow you sit exam
without passing up your project.

406
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:59,972
At least don't give this
excuse again in other subject.

407
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,546
I have a doubt.
Do a girl looks important or the brain?

408
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:42,450
Girl who have look don't need a brain
and vice versa.

409
00:30:43,308 --> 00:30:44,810
Have you seen a girl
without those two?

410
00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:46,486
Why are you asking like that?

411
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,316
I saw her in the morning and now.

412
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:53,489
No guys in the town can take bath
peacefully because of this kind of girls.

413
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,426
Lucky me, I saw her earlier
so I wear a towel.

414
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,504
If not she'll be full insane
and I'll be a half insane

415
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,595
Your are less smart.
If I'm at your place I won't wear any.

416
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,439
Because I got half insane.
I'll give you a treat.

417
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,702
Deva, a tea please.

418
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,490
Can't you hear us?

419
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,463
What happened?
Can't hear a sound because of hit?

420
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,497
I want to kill her!
I won't let her!

421
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:41,541
Don't get tensed for all this.
Everything will be fine.

422
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,340
You don't have experience
in such matters.

423
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,040
If I'm at your place.
Even I don't have her things.

424
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:50,779
I will buy her a new screwdriver or
pen drive and ask her to go out.

425
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,056
I don't need to chase her.
She shamed me right!

426
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,283
I will do the same to her again!

427
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,187
That's so wrong.
What have the 'Valluvar' told?

428
00:31:57,315 --> 00:32:00,023
To me?
- Not to you, to public.

429
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:05,357
Do good things even people
do bad things to you.

430
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:11,736
Kumar, advice is easy to
give not to practice.

431
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,338
Ya,you are right.

432
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:16,977
What happened?

433
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,648
You are bleeding.

434
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,183
You don't have brains!

435
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,111
He's a small kid. He doesn't know
anything and you want to slap him.

436
00:32:26,244 --> 00:32:28,121
Not that Kumar, hejust
kept quite after hitting you.

437
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:29,724
Did you notice it or not.

438
00:32:29,814 --> 00:32:32,693
He didn't throw the stone
to us but at the kite.

439
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:36,428
If the stone hit at the spot he wanted,
he may had his kite.

440
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:42,198
But didn't.
I should do something for him.

441
00:32:43,227 --> 00:32:44,729
Kid,just be here.
I'll be back.

442
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,465
I'll take a chocolate.
- Ya, take it.

443
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:53,509
Kid, eat this choc.
Next time don't throw stones like this.

444
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,015
Is it ok?
- OK, uncle.

445
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:58,250
See that.
I manage to change him in soft way.

446
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,947
This is how we
do in loving way.

447
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:04,758
Only if my father have raised me like this,
I'd be a side dish like Abd Kalam by now.

448
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:06,687
What?
Side dish?

449
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,092
'Venyianee'.

450
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,055
That is called as scientist!

451
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,092
Forget about that.
No regret on that.

452
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:15,670
It's my father who always
beat me when ever I did wrong.

453
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,104
That's why I'm like this.
That is why I never hit anyone.

454
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:22,075
I just show them love by not
respond to their bad doing.

455
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,309
Did you know what
'Appar' told about love?

456
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,280
Yes, I know.
Ask you to shut up an walk.

457
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,787
Why are they staring at us?

458
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:39,988
Look at his head?

459
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:46,034
That black uncle is the one will buy choc
if we hit him with stones.

460
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:48,670
What is happening now?

461
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,078
Come.

462
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,952
Come here!
Always with your kite.

463
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,318
Where have you
been since morning?

464
00:34:07,412 --> 00:34:11,019
<i>'(cu accept“ as atom 'R we spend R
“a or Rp 2k and go around to Ooh;</i>

465
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,959
And cursing me if I spend not
even a cents to go around here.

466
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:16,191
You only better in talking.

467
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,100
Take that.
- Leave that, I'll wash it.

468
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,567
Just pass it to me.

469
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,178
Look at your pants.
So dirty.

470
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:34,606
Normally you will walk on
the street or roll on it?

471
00:34:40,111 --> 00:34:41,454
What is this thread doing here?

472
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,025
What is this?
- Broken blades.

473
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,030
What is this?
- Its ﬂour.

474
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:54,803
What is this for?
- To do kites.

475
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,662
Curse you!

476
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:00,301
Is it how should a
student's pants be?!

477
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,207
Its worst!

478
00:35:06,971 --> 00:35:08,382
What is this small thing?

479
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:12,345
You play with this?
- Pass it to me.

480
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,319
Mom, did that girl look for this?

481
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,554
You?
Who send you in?

482
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,995
Why you came here?

483
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,999
Wait a minute.
Why are you shouting?

484
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,170
Listen to me silently!
- Get lost!

485
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,133
I came to give you something.
And you are chasing me away.

486
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:34,299
Listen to me.

487
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,605
See if this is the one
you looking for?

488
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,118
This is my pen drive right!

489
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:45,745
I doesn't know how it
ended up with me.

490
00:35:46,043 --> 00:35:47,681
My mom found it and gave it to me
while washing my clothes.

491
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,190
I know it was with you.
- But I doesn't know that.

492
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:52,261
If I know earlier,
sure I have pass it to you.

493
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,727
And you shouldn't need
waste a slap for me.

494
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,197
Sorry to tease you
without knowing this.

495
00:36:00,258 --> 00:36:01,635
I don't understand in one thing.

496
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:06,072
Normally if a guy get slapped by a girl,
he will try anything to get her back.

497
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:10,077
But even I slapped you,
you still pass my thing back to me.

498
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,241
I did the wrong thing.

499
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,747
Nothing like that.

500
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,746
If I didn't get this pen drive sure
I will act that way too.

501
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:18,987
I felt bad once I get this pen drive.

502
00:36:19,076 --> 00:36:20,316
How you managed to fine
my house?

503
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:22,652
It is a waste to born in Madras,

504
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,353
If I can't find a house
of a beautiful girl as you.

505
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,492
You said I don't have
a brain nor beauty.

506
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,997
Just teasing you.

507
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:31,657
Then you was my enemy,
now you're my friend.

508
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,272
I need to go to college.
And you have saved my 6 months work.

509
00:36:36,394 --> 00:36:39,637
Everything is ok.
I'll be happy if you can do me a favor.

510
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:42,335
What? -You have slapped
me in front of my friends.

511
00:36:42,433 --> 00:36:43,673
They keep on teasing me.

512
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:48,379
I'm going to tell I have slapped
you back. Pls cover for me.

513
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,214
I need to tell lie that
you slapped me?

514
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,255
That is it.
- I won't tell lies.

515
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:54,784
You just can slapped me for real.

516
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,685
That's not proper.
You don't need to tell lies.

517
00:36:57,782 --> 00:37:00,023
You just don't tell truth
when I tell lies.

518
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,289
That is enough for me.

519
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,734
You are a friend that
save my dignity.

520
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:16,571
I slapped her nicely.
-You slapped her fiercely?

521
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:21,150
This is nothing.
It was worst.

522
00:37:21,672 --> 00:37:24,653
Sure she couldn't hear anything.

523
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:30,158
Suite her coz slapped a boy in public!

524
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:31,552
She got scared once saw you?

525
00:37:31,682 --> 00:37:35,459
Yes she did. I stand in front of
her fiercely like Rajnikanth.

526
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,320
You stand?
- Yes.

527
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:38,299
Fiercely?

528
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,958
Its ok you stand there.

529
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,500
But why are you sitting
by blocking ppl here?

530
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:45,165
This is our area, our bus stand, my bus.
I can stand where ever I wish.

531
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,401
Go and give tickets to passengers.

532
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,742
They will shut my mouth
whenever I question them!

533
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:52,639
Where I stop?
- Rajnikanth.

534
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,579
I stand as fierce as him.

535
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:58,178
She couldn't stand my sight.
And fall to my foot!

536
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:02,119
I'm so proud to admit
that you're my friend.

537
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:06,352
After this no girls
will come near us!

538
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:13,964
What are you doing here?
Not enough of getting from me?

539
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,673
Please don't.
That is enough what I got.

540
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,169
Pity the girl.
Must you hit her like that?

541
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:28,009
You're the one who was praising me
when I said I slapped her.

542
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:31,982
That was then,
see her how sad she is.

543
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:35,056
You no need to be worry.
You can hit him back if you want to.

544
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:36,317
<i>I will</i> take care.

545
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,618
Be quite, you can hit him.
- Again?

546
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,322
I didn't come to hit you.
I'm sorry to hit you.

547
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:44,627
And thanks for giving back my pen drive.

548
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:48,567
What is pen drive?
Is it a big secrets?

549
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:51,105
No, my 6 months
project was inside.

550
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:53,139
If doesn't have it back,
I need to do it again.

551
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,334
It may cost maybe Rp20k more.

552
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:55,570
RPZOk?

553
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:59,111
We have saved that much
amount for you.

554
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:01,647
Can you give us 10 percent
from the amount?

555
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,385
I give you So percent instead.
What do you want?

556
00:39:07,211 --> 00:39:08,622
What shall we do?
Tell.

557
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:10,021
Ya, but where?

558
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,555
Let me tell her.

559
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,931
You guys don't know
anything else then that?

560
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,559
I will give the treat.
- Where?

561
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:21,965
At my house.

562
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,997
In your house?
- Come for lunch.

563
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,977
See how early we came
because of food.

564
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:30,611
Don't make noise.

565
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,175
Come inside.

566
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,458
Is this your house?
- Yes.

567
00:39:43,581 --> 00:39:45,993
So nice.
- Me and my friends lives here.

568
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,697
They are studying with me too.
- Your parents?

569
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:51,027
They are in US.

570
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:55,462
She is Letchumi amma.
She's taking care of us.

571
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,096
She's your maid?
- She is Letchumy amma.

572
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,367
I use to call her amma.

573
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,217
This is the correct timing.
You go and ask her.

574
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,117
How?
- Just ask her.

575
00:40:13,043 --> 00:40:15,580
This is correct timing, she's alone.
Ask her.

576
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,488
How to ask her?

577
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,797
We're going to leave soon.
Ask her!

578
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,396
She's coming alone.
- OK.

579
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,198
Have you finish it?

580
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,472
Priya, I need to ask you something.

581
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,011
Ask.
- You won't think bad about it right.

582
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,015
It based on what you are asking.
Ask.

583
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,608
I never asked this
from any girls before.

584
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,311
What are you going to ask?

585
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,047
You shouldn't misunderstood me.

586
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,689
Just because you invited me for a lunch,
I take this rights to ask you.

587
00:40:50,815 --> 00:40:52,192
Faster ask me.

588
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,155
Is it a letter?
- No.

589
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:56,588
What is that?

590
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:07,107
Its Rajni's photo.
You are a designer right.

591
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,677
If you can design this for me,
I will perform in my school competition.

592
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,645
This is what you
guys was talking about!

593
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,080
But I will do more
better than this.

594
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,089
Why are you giving water for her?
Let her die.

595
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:53,661
Don't talk like that.
She will be fine if we give medicine.

596
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:58,255
Medicine for her?
She's worthless.

597
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,095
She's a satan that
don't want to die.

598
00:46:00,224 --> 00:46:05,037
Look here.
You better die before I kill you.

599
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:18,484
They have called us to come at night.
I guess they have fix time for Paramanan.

600
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:22,022
He is ex MLA.
- That's why he's giving problems.

601
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,316
Bro.
- What are doing here?

602
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:28,988
I'm a brave person.
- So?

603
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:31,066
I can handle weapons well.

604
00:46:31,188 --> 00:46:32,064
I can escape fast.

605
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:33,224
Go home!

606
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:34,768
Please take me in.

607
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,264
My mom is not well.

608
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,666
Don't even have money.

609
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,234
To whom you're talking all this?

610
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,510
I'll beat you up!

611
00:46:44,601 --> 00:46:46,171
Want to handle weapons?!

612
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:52,448
If I ever saw you here!
Want to fight when still studying!

613
00:46:52,576 --> 00:46:54,180
Go!

614
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:57,648
Let move!

615
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:11,265
Take this.
- I don't want. Give me work.

616
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,405
Hold it!

617
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:18,669
If you have problem, come to me.
Don't be stupid!

618
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,608
You don't ever come to
me talking like this.

619
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,754
How brave are you telling
you want handle weapons!

620
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,187
We're suffering at home.

621
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:36,260
Just make a scene in front of him.
He will take you in.

622
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:49,267
Should wait until it get hotter.
Its not mixed well yet!

623
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,276
Have you change your formula?
- You were the one add more water.

624
00:47:52,469 --> 00:47:53,607
You might add more ﬂour in it.

625
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,741
No one can do well as him!
And you are blaming him.

626
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,351
Did you see this kite.

627
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:04,617
Its a huge kite.
Where you got this?

628
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,019
It is in your size.

629
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:10,955
I climb two story house
and caught this.

630
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,126
They might come and claim it.
Hide it.

631
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,535
Let them come.

632
00:48:14,658 --> 00:48:17,537
It is only belongs to them when
they have it in their string.

633
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,267
Give back the kite to me!

634
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:25,479
For what?
- For what?!

635
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:28,279
If I lost and you got it,
it is belongs to me.

636
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:32,047
We didn't stole it.
It was left free, so we caught it.

637
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,212
So you will keep it?
- Yes.

638
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,221
It's a 'baana khatadi' worth of Rploo.

639
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:39,327
I have successfully won 100 kites
with a kite worth of Rs] 0.

640
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,260
And you telling stories after
you have lost your expensive kite.

641
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:44,161
Go and bring any elderly
ppl to come here.

642
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:48,066
You only cut kite's string,
but I cut ppl's throat!

643
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,438
Are we animals to cut
off out throats?

644
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:56,100
You just need this kite right.
Take it!

645
00:50:32,796 --> 00:50:34,139
Bro is here!

646
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:52,021
What all this?

647
00:50:52,115 --> 00:50:55,119
They stole my kite.
- It was off string.

648
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,064
Who is the kite belongs to?
- Mine.

649
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:00,965
Give him back.
- It was off the string.

650
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:03,538
It belongs to who ever caught it.
And you are asking to give back to him.

651
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:06,038
I worked so hard to catch it.

652
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,267
Just pass it to him.

653
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:17,110
Go!
- I'll go first bro.

654
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:23,352
Do they give back the
kites that went there?

655
00:51:23,447 --> 00:51:25,051
But you have gave
that back to him!

656
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,286
It was baana khatadi.

657
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,498
Wipe all your faces
and follow me.

658
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:51,684
Come in.

659
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,280
Sit.
- Its ok, bro.

660
00:51:55,412 --> 00:51:56,755
Just sit!

661
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:00,994
Do you want to
drink anything?

662
00:52:01,084 --> 00:52:02,620
Its ok bro.

663
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:03,958
Wait.

664
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,324
Take this.

665
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:13,725
This is belongs to me.
Keep it.

666
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,102
Don't always fight at
the street.

667
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,143
What?
- I have a doubt.

668
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:25,302
What is it?

669
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:29,316
There is always a warning at
the cigarette packets for smokers.

670
00:53:29,739 --> 00:53:30,717
Yes, so what?

671
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:36,086
Even in the liquor bottles
showed warning.

672
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,351
So what do you want to know?

673
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:42,063
How about ppl like you
who go for prostitute?

674
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,722
Where do they put the warnings?

675
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,697
When did you thought of this?

676
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:47,327
While I was sleeping yesterday.

677
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,596
Look at your face!

678
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,268
Ppl asked to dream like
Abd Kalam for future.

679
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,397
But dreaming all nonsense.

680
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:58,703
Is he a human being!
- You didn't answer him yet right.

681
00:53:58,802 --> 00:54:00,213
Do I need to tell publicly!

682
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:04,046
Even I'm not a hero like you,
I have my good reputation.

683
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:05,312
Don't spoil it!

684
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:08,146
Did you saw things
at bro Ravi's house?

685
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,089
What will happen if
stab someone with that.

686
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:12,557
At least 7 years or to
be sent to the gallows.

687
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:13,990
Either one is confirmed.

688
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,586
Pass me potti (lighter).
I don't have it.

689
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,996
Pass me lighter.
- I only have one track potti (box) at home.

690
00:54:20,223 --> 00:54:22,533
Better ask a buffalo
then asking you!

691
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,072
There is one passing.
Ask him.

692
00:54:26,997 --> 00:54:27,998
You!

693
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,107
You fatty!
Wait!

694
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,374
You have matchbox?
- No.

695
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:36,176
Tum and answer me.
Are we dancing nakedly here!

696
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,719
Why are you so embarrass?
Fat man!

697
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:57,635
Why is your leg in a place but
your eyes wondering around?

698
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,067
You are searching for Priya right?

699
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,078
Yes I am.
So?

700
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,948
Wait a while.
I will ask them

701
00:55:25,422 --> 00:55:29,302
Priya's uncle from Australia is
here. That's why she's not here.

702
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,500
What happen?
You tensed up?

703
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:36,566
I'm just kidding. She's not here
because not feeling well.

704
00:55:36,766 --> 00:55:39,042
Bus is going to leave.
Let's go.

705
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:49,754
Sheikh.
Come here.

706
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,022
What is it? - Bro, is going
hunting tonight at Naga Thotum.

707
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,356
Do <i>come.</i>

708
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:54,083
Why is he herel?

709
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,058
Pick him up.
We bring him to the hospital.

710
00:56:58,148 --> 00:57:00,560
What are you talking!
How to answer if the doctor ask?

711
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:03,323
What will you answer?
- He will die if we just leave him here.

712
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,923
Let's move.
Go!

713
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:08,432
Come!

714
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:41,624
I advised him like
advising a small kid.

715
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,072
Don't involve in this.
It will strike us back.

716
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:47,140
Didn't listen.

717
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,304
Promise, I don't even know he
will be coming there.

718
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:54,009
He camejust to die.

719
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:55,411
Insane!

720
00:58:03,246 --> 00:58:04,987
All just because of his mother.

721
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:19,466
The things I do is
not a work at all.

722
00:58:19,963 --> 00:58:23,672
Pity them begging
me to let them go.

723
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:27,414
I just ignored them and keep
chopping them.

724
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,244
Don't do all this.

725
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:40,319
Don't have money to take care mom,
to pay fees, or any other probs.

726
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:45,431
Then if anyone come
to me like Sheikh did!

727
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,663
Me too was enjoying life just
like you guys,

728
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:53,763
They took my kites
and gave weapons to me.

729
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,542
I couldn't put the
weapons down till now.

730
00:58:58,067 --> 00:59:02,641
I started to kill to save my life,
but now I'm killing for saving others.

731
00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:08,178
Its a cursed work.
You all don't need this.

732
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:14,086
Don't admire me!
Spit at me!

733
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:16,430
Pray so you won't be like me.

734
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,930
Who is the girl?

735
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,138
I did have someone like her.

736
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:29,304
Life was so beautiful then.

737
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:36,482
My work and behavior
have ruined my life.

738
00:59:40,009 --> 00:59:43,013
She is an angel.
Just go if she calls you.

739
00:59:44,714 --> 00:59:47,593
If you're a kite,
she's the string.

740
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:52,362
Use the string and
go to the sky happily.

741
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,104
Do you understand me?
Everyone go back home.

742
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:18,517
Why did you bring me here?
Do you really have money?

743
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:21,788
Money doesn't matters.
You just be silent for a while.

744
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,198
I feel uncomfortable sitting here.
Shall we go from here.

745
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,180
Cut the cake.

746
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:56,189
Cut the cake. We were waiting so
long for this and we're hungry.

747
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,176
Feed her.

748
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:40,036
Thank you so much. No one have
celebrate my birthday like this before.

749
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,305
Even I don't know I will
celebrate in such.

750
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:48,314
Why are you talking like this?
You're my close friend.

751
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,346
There you are.
Unwrap this.

752
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:55,317
What is it?
- Guess what is inside?

753
01:01:56,279 --> 01:01:57,087
Dress?

754
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:00,459
You're wrong.

755
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,063
Is cooling glass this big!

756
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:05,998
Is it foreign perfume?

757
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,194
Oh my god.
Just unwrap it and see.

758
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,111
Do you know what is this?
It's a Korean kite.

759
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,979
It's your biggest happiness right.

760
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,211
You're very good in
this right.

761
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:29,216
Do you like it?
- It is superb.

762
01:02:30,346 --> 01:02:32,053
Tomorrow you must play this.

763
01:02:33,483 --> 01:02:35,429
First go and wash your face.

764
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,268
Yes sir.

765
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,070
Who is she?

766
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:51,277
5he'sjust a friend.

767
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,108
It will change
when time goes.

768
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:59,053
You should propose to the girl once
you had the feeling towards her.

769
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:04,014
Don't be scared to tell your love,
if not your heart will hurts.

770
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:09,051
You are?
- Ithayam (heart) Raja.

771
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:11,528
I'm doing final year in medical.

772
01:03:29,438 --> 01:03:32,044
Is he still studying in
college at his age?

773
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:37,551
It is confirmed that this is love.
- Is giving kite will conclude as love?!

774
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,060
Then, she took an effort to
find out what gift you liked most.

775
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,289
That is love right?
- Why can't we take it as friendship?

776
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:47,390
Even last month it was his birthday,
why she didn't buy anything?

777
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,992
Why only you she treats as special?

778
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:53,599
So is it love?
- It was from earlier.

779
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,572
What bro Ravi told is true.
You are so gifted.

780
01:03:57,633 --> 01:03:59,806
You're going to achieve greater things.

781
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:13,127
Do you want to eat?
No, I ate there.

782
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,122
Any courier from dad?

783
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:18,998
Nothing.

784
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:26,071
Do you want to eat?
- I ate at Ramesh's birthday party.

785
01:04:27,363 --> 01:04:31,072
I'm just a servant here,
I shouldn't tell all this.

786
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:35,573
But I feel have to tell.
- You can say anything you want.

787
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,549
Am I treating you as my servant?!
- It's not that.

788
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:43,021
Even how much you care for them,
they still low class ppl.

789
01:04:43,112 --> 01:04:46,218
They will have one bad thoughts.
It can't be changed.

790
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:48,124
I know my limits.

791
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:50,527
Even they're low class
but they are good ppl.

792
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,695
OK then.
- Don't think unnecessary things.

793
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,200
Go and sleep.

794
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:28,200
How many times to remind you?
Why are you always coming late?

795
01:05:28,291 --> 01:05:29,531
Not enough tell you once..

796
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:33,528
Only now he feel the love for me.

797
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:33,768
Only now he feel the love for me.

798
01:05:36,532 --> 01:05:39,513
Why are you smiling at your father?
You gone mad?

799
01:05:41,704 --> 01:05:44,275
What are doing with
the kite at this time?

800
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:48,315
Can't hear me?
I'm asking right?

801
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:52,652
You brainless!
You gone mad?

802
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,207
Ramesh here.
- Tell me, Ramesh.

803
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:13,473
You didn't go to college?
- I'm at college, got project work.

804
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,112
Tell me fast, my professor
will call me any time.

805
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:19,082
I need to discuss an
important thing with you.

806
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,141
Tell!

807
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:24,318
I will only discuss it personally.
- Don't have chance to meet up today.

808
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:28,620
Can we meet up in the evening?
- We meet up at 7pm at the broken pillar?

809
01:11:40,262 --> 01:11:42,799
Mom, I'm leaving now.
- Come here.

810
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:45,541
What is it?

811
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,412
Normally you only bath
once in the morning.

812
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,610
Why in sudden taking
bath in the evening?

813
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,277
It's nothing.
- You're so handsome today.

814
01:11:55,411 --> 01:12:00,081
So give me R5100.
- Don't advantage!

815
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:05,122
You are asking me money as if your father is
working at Collector's office.

816
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,165
Go away.
- Then why you told me I'm looking good?

817
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:09,964
OK, erase what I said then.
- You are mad, mom.

818
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:15,506
Is the size correct?

819
01:12:15,597 --> 01:12:18,305
Do you want to try it first
as trying clothes before buying it?

820
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:19,572
Are you teasing me?

821
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,547
Rest of them just buying
without knowing any size?

822
01:12:22,638 --> 01:12:25,619
But you are asking
about all the sizes!

823
01:12:25,741 --> 01:12:27,448
Go faster, it's the
time ladies comes to shop.

824
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:35,490
What do you want?
- Give me choc.

825
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:37,063
Tea for me?

826
01:12:37,519 --> 01:12:39,294
Give me R5100.
- For what?

827
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:42,095
No need to know,just give me R5100.

828
01:12:42,224 --> 01:12:45,296
Tell me what is the matter?
- Tell me first, then I'll give you.

829
01:12:45,427 --> 01:12:47,338
Can you just give the money?

830
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,506
What is the problem now?

831
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,168
Can you bend for a while?
- Why are you asking me to do that?

832
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:54,110
You just bend, I will tell.
- For what?

833
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,516
Let him go.
He said he have an important matter.

834
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:02,145
Even he's going so fresh.

835
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:04,756
He took everything.

836
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:37,613
Is it so late?
- No, I just came.

837
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:42,091
Why are you came so smart?

838
01:13:44,686 --> 01:13:47,064
What is the matter?
Why you asked me to come suddenly?

839
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:50,663
I need to tell you something.
- What is that?

840
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:54,704
No, need to give you something.
- What had happen to you?

841
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,606
You said want to tell then
you said want to give.

842
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:05,011
I bought you something.

843
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:18,294
What is that?
- Nothing, Priya.

844
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,025
Don't lie.
Show it to me.

845
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,498
It's nothing, Priya.

846
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:25,326
You bought it for me right.
Give it to me.

847
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:26,305
Listen to me Priya.

848
01:14:26,395 --> 01:14:28,068
Look there.
Seems like he's dealing with prostitute.

849
01:14:28,597 --> 01:14:32,739
It doesn't look like that.
It seems he's disturbing that girl!

850
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,513
Priya, nothing is there.

851
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:37,215
Listen to me.

852
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:55,632
What are you doing here?

853
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:03,200
She's my friend.

854
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,405
What is this?

855
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:13,346
Do you bring along condom
to meet you friends?

856
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,989
You used to play kites.
Now you have started a new work?

857
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:21,189
No, sir.
- Do you know him?

858
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:28,728
I don't know him.

859
01:15:41,003 --> 01:15:44,007
All these losers always do
this cheap thing to girls!

860
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:46,083
Beat them up and
put them in the jail!

861
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,653
Then only they will repent.
Scumbags!

862
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:40,401
What is your age?
Using condoms!

863
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:45,668
I have two kids.
Even I don't know how to use it!

864
01:16:46,702 --> 01:16:47,680
Look at them!

865
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:52,047
Students nowadays keeping condoms
as bus pass in their pockets!

866
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,289
I'm asking right.
Answer me!

867
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:01,992
How dare you disturb girls!

868
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:04,026
Stand up!

869
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:07,929
We should give him a treat.
He will answer then.

870
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:12,962
Remove his pants and see whether
he have any pills beside this condom.

871
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:15,007
Remove your pants.
- Please, don't sir.

872
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,004
Sir, please let me go.

873
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:24,376
Why don't want remove your pants
when having condom in your hand?

874
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:27,486
We are a bit backwards.
We don't know how to use it.

875
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:29,317
You show a demo how to use it.

876
01:17:29,411 --> 01:17:30,549
We will use it in future.

877
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:33,325
You feel shame?

878
01:17:34,616 --> 01:17:36,095
How about your shame to that girl?

879
01:17:40,022 --> 01:17:43,299
Stand up!
Remove it!

880
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:54,107
Make him sit like this.
Let his parents come.

881
01:17:54,302 --> 01:17:56,339
You get me!
Make sure they sees him in this manner.

882
01:17:56,538 --> 01:17:59,041
We can even throw them
in coz have such kid.

883
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:20,171
Take this.

884
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,078
Why are you crying?

885
01:18:29,104 --> 01:18:32,517
It's is because of your good
behavior nothing bad happened.

886
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:36,019
If not they might done anything to you!

887
01:18:36,545 --> 01:18:38,547
I came from such that place too.

888
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:41,760
I know better about them then you.

889
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,586
They are rubbish.

890
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:48,091
How upset your parents will be
if they were here.

891
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:51,204
Why this things happened?
What wrong did I do?

892
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:53,329
Is it wrong for me to befriends
with them?

893
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:03,714
Leave it sis.
Why crying for all these?

894
01:19:04,072 --> 01:19:06,109
Kumar is bringing the councilor right.

895
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:07,346
Be brave.

896
01:19:15,283 --> 01:19:17,957
Greetings.
- You all don't have problem right?

897
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:22,568
Come bro.
They keep on disturbing our kids.

898
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:26,036
Keep quite.
- Don't worry. I am here.

899
01:19:26,161 --> 01:19:27,299
I'll go and see them.

900
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:47,022
Why are you torturing me?
How many times I need to tell you this!

901
01:19:47,115 --> 01:19:49,527
Why are you keep on chasing him?

902
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:54,764
Are you just running police
station or something else?

903
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:55,761
Let him go.

904
01:19:56,358 --> 01:20:00,170
Did I caught him having a kite?
He had condom while messing with a girl.

905
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:01,400
That's why he is here.

906
01:20:01,530 --> 01:20:04,064
Do you know who is his father?
- Who?

907
01:20:04,065 --> 01:20:08,013
He's son of ex Councilor Baskaran.
- Is he?

908
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:11,245
Come here!
Let him go.

909
01:20:13,408 --> 01:20:15,081
Seems like he will
spoil his father's name.

910
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:16,382
He won't do such thing.

911
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:22,118
Youngsters at his age, are drunken
and do all sort of misbehavior.

912
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:25,697
But he is good person.
- You always certify them as good person.

913
01:20:26,188 --> 01:20:28,600
You didn't lodge FIR on him?

914
01:20:28,723 --> 01:20:30,031
Did we?
- No, sir.

915
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:31,729
We didn't.
Let him go.

916
01:20:32,060 --> 01:20:33,038
Pass him his clothes.

917
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:36,065
Look here! Your father's
name saved you today.

918
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:40,110
If I saw you in the same action again!
You're doomed!

919
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:42,281
Go!
- Take your clothes.

920
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:44,349
Wear it.

921
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:50,783
My ppl are waiting for me outside.
I will send him first.

922
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:06,767
What is so bad happened?
Why are you both sitting sadly?

923
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:08,700
Eat this rice first!

924
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,037
Why are you showing
your anger at the food?

925
01:21:14,135 --> 01:21:17,776
They have let your son go, right!
Sure he was hungry the whole night.

926
01:21:18,073 --> 01:21:20,019
He will only eats once you eat, right!

927
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:26,058
What is the story?

928
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:28,388
I heard police have brought
him to police station.

929
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:32,454
They have let him go.
They always do this to our kids.

930
01:21:32,587 --> 01:21:35,067
They brought him for suspect case.
- You are telling this.

931
01:21:35,156 --> 01:21:38,569
But ppl outside telling something else.
- What are they telling?

932
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:42,506
The fair girl who always
with Ramesh,

933
01:21:42,631 --> 01:21:44,338
It seems he tried to ashamed her.

934
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:48,710
Curse you.
How dare you talk like this in my house.

935
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:50,146
Get out!

936
01:21:50,272 --> 01:21:53,116
You are getting upset with me,
but ppl are talking about this!

937
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:56,051
What do they know about my son!

938
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:57,282
Only me knows about him!

939
01:21:57,445 --> 01:21:59,652
Who else can have a son like him?

940
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:06,191
It have been 10 years his father left us.
Have he asked anything from me?

941
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:11,237
Rest of kids wear expensive
clothing when any festival comes.

942
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:16,604
He wore happily what ever
I managed to buy for him.

943
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:22,309
Not even my father nor my
husband have take care of me so well.

944
01:22:22,504 --> 01:22:27,510
But my son take care of me so
well even I have small headache.

945
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:33,220
There is a lot ppl out there
doing all the bad things.

946
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,352
Do my son have any of that
bad behavior!

947
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,995
You don't need talk about
my son's behavior.

948
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,699
Why are you getting tensed at me?
I just told you what they are talking.

949
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,032
Why should I care if they talked about him.

950
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:45,727
I won't believe even if God himself
tells bad about him!

951
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:50,668
He's my life!
Dare talk about him.

952
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:53,143
Get out!
Ask her to go out.

953
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:55,111
They are asking you to go right.
Go!

954
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:03,689
Are you crying?

955
01:23:16,024 --> 01:23:17,128
He's crying.

956
01:23:19,294 --> 01:23:21,035
Only good person cries!

957
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,442
He won't go to police
station anymore.

958
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,605
Bring the food.

959
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:34,579
Cry!
Cry as loud you want.

960
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,402
How can he fell
asleep once lay down?

961
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:00,940
Its time for hunting!

962
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:09,147
Is he sleeping?

963
01:24:15,283 --> 01:24:16,421
He just put the money here!

964
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:26,000
I did saw you were putting it here!
Where did it vanished?

965
01:24:26,628 --> 01:24:28,198
Its seems so unbelievable!

966
01:24:28,997 --> 01:24:31,102
Sleep well!
I'll bite you throat off.

967
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:33,108
Keep on cheating me!

968
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:55,464
There is nothing to be found
in the pocket when I tried.

969
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:57,035
But got money when he did.

970
01:24:57,225 --> 01:24:59,603
Maybe because I didn't dig
his pocket more deeper.

971
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:02,674
You can go now!
I will try it again.

972
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:21,719
Come, its already late.
- You don't hear us?

973
01:25:22,016 --> 01:25:23,051
It's already late.
Lets go.

974
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:23,992
I'm not coming.
You all go.

975
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:26,292
You don't feel well right?
- Nothing like that.

976
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:28,264
How many days you
keep thinking about it! Lets go!

977
01:25:28,389 --> 01:25:30,699
I am telling you, I'm not coming right!
Go!

978
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:32,533
Why is he getting mad at us?
Lets go.

979
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:51,588
Where are you going?

980
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:22,020
There they are.

981
01:26:32,687 --> 01:26:36,328
Are you fine? -You have decided
to embarrass me in my college too?

982
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,094
Not like that. I just want to tell you
what happened..

983
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,967
I don't need to know anything.

984
01:26:41,296 --> 01:26:42,639
Why are you talking like this?

985
01:26:42,764 --> 01:26:45,074
What is the use to study a lot of things?

986
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:48,204
Even you have befriend with him for a
time, but you didn't understand him.

987
01:26:48,303 --> 01:26:52,513
Ya, I didn't understands me him well.
Now I do!

988
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:55,986
You're wrong.
He's not as you think.

989
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:57,112
But I am.

990
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:00,389
It is a shameful thing that
a man to tell a matter to a girl.

991
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:01,653
But still I will tell you.

992
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:05,931
I have a big weakness
in girls matters.

993
01:27:06,020 --> 01:27:08,091
I always carry along a
condom packet in my pocket.

994
01:27:08,556 --> 01:27:09,660
Even I have one now.

995
01:27:13,027 --> 01:27:16,565
He mistakenly brought this when he
try to take money from me to see you.

996
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:18,735
He doesn't know anything
about all this stuff.

997
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:22,471
He don't even know
how to talk to ppl.

998
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,675
But he is a good person.

999
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,414
I did the wrong thing.
Pity him.

1000
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:30,682
Only he doesn't know how to talk.
Even do you!

1001
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:33,958
You are showing condom to a
girl as showing a ID card!

1002
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:36,451
You have showed me
low class thoughts, right!

1003
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:40,090
All the ppl told me,
even my friends and my servant.

1004
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:43,691
Don't befriends with low class ppl.
I didn't listen to them.

1005
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:46,639
I didn't sees you all like that.

1006
01:27:47,795 --> 01:27:49,502
But you all manage to prove it!

1007
01:27:49,697 --> 01:27:51,074
Not that.
- Its enough!

1008
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:52,576
I've faced a lot things
by being your friend.

1009
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,213
No need to tell me anything.

1010
01:27:55,003 --> 01:27:59,076
I thought of changing you like me,
but don't try to change me like you.

1011
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,252
Please let me in peace.
Please go away.

1012
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:31,094
What are you doingl?
The dead is ex MLA!

1013
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:52,588
L\\ § \ \ EN§ I

1014
01:30:54,816 --> 01:30:56,454
Why do you want to brake the door?

1015
01:30:57,585 --> 01:31:00,031
You will wake up the neighbours.

1016
01:31:02,023 --> 01:31:04,435
Why are you going to sleep straight?
Wash your hands and eat.

1017
01:31:04,625 --> 01:31:07,037
I don't want.
Why don't want?

1018
01:31:07,261 --> 01:31:08,672
I don't want anything.

1019
01:31:11,098 --> 01:31:15,012
Why are you look scared?
- Nothing, I'm sleepy.

1020
01:31:16,604 --> 01:31:19,585
Don't know what have happened?
You're not joy as used to be.

1021
01:31:19,707 --> 01:31:22,711
Coming back late.
As been possessed by ghost.

1022
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:01,316
Come.

1023
01:32:17,198 --> 01:32:20,145
You shouldn't be there.
You can't stay here anymore.

1024
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:22,441
Go somewhere.
- What are you telling bro?

1025
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:25,073
I'm not asking you to
but ordering you!

1026
01:32:27,475 --> 01:32:28,545
Take this.

1027
01:32:28,776 --> 01:32:30,619
Go and stay some
where else for a while.

1028
01:32:30,811 --> 01:32:33,087
Understand?
- How to not even telling mom.

1029
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:37,994
Do as I told you!
- Promise I won't tell anyone.

1030
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:42,432
If ever I saw you at our place around 7pm.
Better go!

1031
01:32:43,024 --> 01:32:44,002
Understand!

1032
01:33:07,682 --> 01:33:12,495
Seth is having fun life.
All because of money.

1033
01:33:12,687 --> 01:33:16,601
You teased him at his place.
Even he helps us out.

1034
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:18,600
Until now we never been to the
Central Station,

1035
01:33:18,726 --> 01:33:20,501
How to go to Gujarat
by believing him?

1036
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:23,107
Yes, its true.
Everyone talk in Hindi there.

1037
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:25,069
I don't even good in Tamil.

1038
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,608
Keep quite!
Seth is coming.

1039
01:33:35,476 --> 01:33:37,183
They will pick you up at the bus station.

1040
01:33:37,411 --> 01:33:39,482
You know Shuut right?

1041
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:42,993
You going on the right timing.
It's a season for kites festival.

1042
01:33:43,084 --> 01:33:44,392
Go and makeTamizhan proud.

1043
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:47,989
I have told my mom that you
send me for work at Gujarat.

1044
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:50,467
She will keep on calling you.
Pls handle her.

1045
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:52,298
I will.
Go safely.

1046
01:33:52,426 --> 01:33:53,598
Do you need any money?

1047
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:55,036
No, I have.

1048
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:08,016
Can't contact you. - Marriage was in
remote village where no signal.

1049
01:34:13,114 --> 01:34:18,120
What are you doing?
Have this sweets.

1050
01:34:18,319 --> 01:34:20,128
Don't want.
- Its a Gujarat special.

1051
01:34:21,055 --> 01:34:22,295
Take it.

1052
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:24,428
Actual you should
giving all of us sweets.

1053
01:34:24,558 --> 01:34:26,333
Now I give you first,
later its your turn.

1054
01:34:26,427 --> 01:34:29,203
What are talking about?
Why must you give sweets behalf of me?

1055
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:31,742
You trying to act?
I know everything.

1056
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:33,478
How did he proposed you?

1057
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:38,415
You surprised with his gift?

1058
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:41,047
Why are you staring like this?

1059
01:34:41,142 --> 01:34:45,557
Any girls will cry if a boy
show condom and ask her go out.

1060
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:50,120
Will he do that?
- He did!

1061
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,231
No, Priya.
You did a mistake.

1062
01:34:52,319 --> 01:34:54,230
Do you know how much
love he have for you?

1063
01:34:54,321 --> 01:34:57,495
I don't understand
what ever I'm doing.

1064
01:34:57,625 --> 01:35:01,129
I went to bus stop to buy milk,
and sat there and forgot everything.

1065
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:04,064
Why?
- Even I don't know why.

1066
01:35:04,065 --> 01:35:06,238
If I ask my boys, they are
confirming it is.

1067
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,505
What do you mean by that?

1068
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:09,740
Love, you are acting
as if you don't know!

1069
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:12,415
Why are you like this?
You were with Priya all this long right?

1070
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,577
Yes. - But why are you confessing
your love to me?

1071
01:35:15,342 --> 01:35:18,050
Don't hope that to happen.
Can I be in love with you?

1072
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:19,749
You have looked terribly
down upon me.

1073
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:22,118
If you have such feelings,
pls change your mind.

1074
01:35:22,316 --> 01:35:25,126
I'm not a person who
ﬂirt around with a lots of girls.

1075
01:35:25,252 --> 01:35:27,960
I'm like Ramar,
who will be honest with one.

1076
01:35:28,055 --> 01:35:30,001
She's college and you're plus two.

1077
01:35:30,091 --> 01:35:32,367
You girls senior in studies
and I'm senior in age.

1078
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:35,134
We all will be finishing
our studies patiently.

1079
01:35:35,262 --> 01:35:38,732
My mom only send me to school
when I'm 8 years old because,

1080
01:35:39,033 --> 01:35:41,035
she scared anything happen
to me when I go to school.

1081
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:42,637
You failed actually.
But you just talk big.

1082
01:35:42,770 --> 01:35:45,273
Don't think she is poor coz
traveling in college bus.

1083
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,181
Her parents staying in US.

1084
01:35:47,274 --> 01:35:50,050
She's being casual just
because of her friends.

1085
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:51,455
You're her friend.

1086
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,526
You should know in and out what
she does and doesn't like.

1087
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:59,662
She must say ok once I propose her.
So you must help me.

1088
01:35:59,787 --> 01:36:01,994
What should I do?
- I'm going to buy her a gift.

1089
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:03,397
You help me to choose the gift.

1090
01:36:03,524 --> 01:36:05,526
Must buy a gift that
really shows my true love.

1091
01:36:11,966 --> 01:36:13,172
Do you want to buy this for her?

1092
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:23,383
How about this?

1093
01:36:27,014 --> 01:36:28,687
Do you really studying for fashion?

1094
01:36:29,717 --> 01:36:32,425
I'm thinking to buy something
different for her.

1095
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:34,692
I guess you will ask me to buy a
greeting cards for her!

1096
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:36,200
Hold this.
Come.

1097
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:39,301
What is this?

1098
01:36:39,627 --> 01:36:41,231
Write name on the rice.

1099
01:36:44,165 --> 01:36:45,109
Can you write that?

1100
01:37:17,097 --> 01:37:19,236
He loves you so much.

1101
01:37:21,735 --> 01:37:22,736
What have you done?

1102
01:37:28,542 --> 01:37:29,520
It's locked.

1103
01:37:30,110 --> 01:37:32,613
Malika sis will know,
she will be at the bus stop.

1104
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:37,961
We can ask Kumar.

1105
01:37:41,589 --> 01:37:42,624
For what?

1106
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:46,733
The way I talked to you that day.
- We are the one need to apologize from you.

1107
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:49,300
We are the low class ppl.
Don't know how to think.

1108
01:37:49,496 --> 01:37:51,737
Not like that.
It's my fault.

1109
01:37:52,266 --> 01:37:54,177
Where is Ramesh?
Need to see him.

1110
01:37:54,268 --> 01:37:56,612
Wanted to see him?
Where do you want to meet him?

1111
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:59,274
He was happy hanging around.
But now have ran away from this place.

1112
01:37:59,406 --> 01:38:01,249
He left this place?
Where to?

1113
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:04,112
To Gujerat.
Gujarat?

1114
01:39:30,264 --> 01:39:34,110
Down here everyone plays kites!
What are we going to do here?

1115
01:39:40,641 --> 01:39:44,020
Even grannies playing kites here!

1116
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:48,124
You can't do anything here.

1117
01:40:01,628 --> 01:40:02,572
Should I let it go?

1118
01:41:00,454 --> 01:41:02,092
Give me.
- No.

1119
01:41:07,027 --> 01:41:08,028
Let the string a bit.

1120
01:41:16,103 --> 01:41:19,141
She begged me.
That's why I told where are we.

1121
01:41:19,273 --> 01:41:21,253
Why staring at him?
This is my hometown.

1122
01:41:21,375 --> 01:41:22,513
We will come anytime
as I wish.

1123
01:41:33,554 --> 01:41:34,726
Please wait for a while.

1124
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:39,169
I'm really sorry. This is my biggest
mistake I have ever done.

1125
01:41:39,660 --> 01:41:42,300
I didn't believe you.
That is the truth.

1126
01:41:43,063 --> 01:41:45,771
That is why I got angry.
Now I understand.

1127
01:41:48,035 --> 01:41:49,810
The pain will go
once you said sorry?

1128
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,677
You threw me away like an orphan
by telling you don't know me!

1129
01:41:53,807 --> 01:41:56,447
Will that pain disappear?
- It is my wrong.

1130
01:41:57,077 --> 01:41:58,556
Try to think from my view.

1131
01:41:58,645 --> 01:41:59,555
What is so big about your view?!

1132
01:42:00,013 --> 01:42:03,256
Will you do the as same
as you did to me if your friend or,

1133
01:42:03,383 --> 01:42:04,521
Your relative guys
who bring that condom?

1134
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:07,155
You will take it easy right.

1135
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:10,159
But when I mistakenly brought it,
you get mad?

1136
01:42:10,257 --> 01:42:14,034
Why?
Because we all low class.

1137
01:42:14,161 --> 01:42:16,334
Right?
- No it is not, you think wrongly.

1138
01:42:17,364 --> 01:42:19,037
It is now I can think straight.

1139
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:22,239
Once I fell in love with you,
my brain doesn't work well.

1140
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:26,210
If my brain was working,
I should aware of status of you and me.

1141
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:31,718
Hiding the pain by smiling is
greater then the pain itself.

1142
01:42:32,746 --> 01:42:36,250
But most important thing is
you have showed me,

1143
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:38,057
My mother's feeling onwards me,
what she thinks about me.

1144
01:42:38,152 --> 01:42:39,290
Thanks for that.

1145
01:42:41,088 --> 01:42:43,625
Sometimes we won't
get what we wanted.

1146
01:42:43,824 --> 01:42:47,772
But after that, what will we get is more
greater then we wanted before.

1147
01:42:48,061 --> 01:42:50,735
I need you before,
but I got my mom.

1148
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:54,745
Now you need me, so you
will get better of me later.

1149
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:58,339
Why are you talking like this?
I feel you're better for me.

1150
01:42:58,438 --> 01:43:01,510
You don't realise this that day!
That day I was a low class person right!

1151
01:43:01,608 --> 01:43:03,383
Just say we get together.

1152
01:43:03,477 --> 01:43:06,287
In future any problem arise,
I will be a low class person again.

1153
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:09,484
Pls let me go.
I don't like to continue this conversation.

1154
01:48:15,489 --> 01:48:18,993
Is bro Ravi in?
I need to see him.

1155
01:48:25,665 --> 01:48:28,544
Where is he?
- Taking bath.

1156
01:48:45,752 --> 01:48:47,356
I'm back from Gujarat.

1157
01:49:04,404 --> 01:49:06,406
Came back from Gujarat.
Take this sweet.

1158
01:49:08,074 --> 01:49:09,417
The money you gave.

1159
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:12,488
I have earned a lot of money on
joining in the kites competition.

1160
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:14,690
Take this bro.

1161
01:49:18,685 --> 01:49:21,029
I didn't even told my friends.

1162
01:49:22,722 --> 01:49:23,928
I go back first.

1163
01:49:38,438 --> 01:49:42,011
Eat nicely and sleep!

1164
01:49:45,278 --> 01:49:48,418
How to laugh when sees him.
Only sadness will come.

1165
01:49:50,617 --> 01:49:52,528
Wonder when he will change.

1166
01:49:57,190 --> 01:49:58,567
Going to steal his money
tonight!

1167
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:19,318
I saw that he did keep his money
here! But its not here now!

1168
01:50:19,412 --> 01:50:22,791
Is he doing some magic?
Curse him! <i>I will</i> see in the morning.

1169
01:50:33,093 --> 01:50:35,369
It's happening again.

1170
01:50:36,663 --> 01:50:40,110
Dear I'm leaving now.
- Go! Don't come back.

1171
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:44,077
Early morning he's showing his magic.
<i>I will</i> get him.

1172
01:50:46,106 --> 01:50:47,449
What had happened to you?

1173
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:52,588
Always with the book.
Give it to me.

1174
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:54,785
Give back my book.

1175
01:50:57,517 --> 01:50:59,087
Don't I know about you.

1176
01:50:59,519 --> 01:51:03,057
Even if you read 5 days, but you can't
even remember half page.

1177
01:51:03,189 --> 01:51:04,327
I am reading.

1178
01:51:04,658 --> 01:51:06,365
Don't I know about
my own son?

1179
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:10,303
I have never seen you sit in
the house for one whole day!

1180
01:51:10,730 --> 01:51:14,041
You have changed after you
came from police station.

1181
01:51:15,502 --> 01:51:17,345
Who never been to the police station?

1182
01:51:17,437 --> 01:51:19,644
And you keep worrying and
thinking about it.

1183
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:23,643
Pity your friends.
They keep worrying about you.

1184
01:51:23,777 --> 01:51:25,085
Wake up!

1185
01:51:25,278 --> 01:51:27,417
Go!Yourfriends
will be waiting for you.

1186
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:29,221
Go and play with them.
- Let me go.

1187
01:51:36,022 --> 01:51:39,299
Make sure only come back at night.
I will brake your legs if come back earlier.

1188
01:51:41,294 --> 01:51:42,295
Wait!

1189
01:51:43,129 --> 01:51:46,770
Have you meditation over?
- Teasing me!

1190
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:49,172
You were staying in the
kitchen like a girl!

1191
01:51:49,302 --> 01:51:50,508
Come, we go for movie.

1192
01:51:50,637 --> 01:51:51,775
I'm not coming.
- I have 3 tickets forthale's movie.

1193
01:51:52,072 --> 01:51:54,552
Come let's go.
- I have no mood.

1194
01:51:54,641 --> 01:51:56,143
Why are you behaving like thisl?

1195
01:51:56,276 --> 01:51:57,812
It have been so long we went
for movie together!

1196
01:51:58,111 --> 01:52:00,387
Come let's go together.
- You all go ahead, I don't have mood.

1197
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:02,323
So in that case we go to the other
movie, you will get mood there!

1198
01:52:02,749 --> 01:52:06,060
Then what is the nonsense,
telling no mood and all.

1199
01:52:06,186 --> 01:52:08,632
Now you're coming!
- OK!

1200
01:52:08,755 --> 01:52:10,701
Take this ticket. You go first,
we will take money from Kumar.

1201
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:14,033
Why can't we go together?
- No need money!

1202
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:17,266
You go first before the movie starts.
We will get money.

1203
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:19,240
Faster leave!

1204
01:53:05,678 --> 01:53:07,089
Don't leave on the middle!

1205
01:53:07,213 --> 01:53:08,954
I don't know what else to do.

1206
01:53:09,249 --> 01:53:12,253
I don't know what else to
do even this seems cheap.

1207
01:53:12,385 --> 01:53:15,525
I need to say sorry.
I want you.

1208
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:20,093
Notjust as a friend but a lover.

1209
01:53:21,227 --> 01:53:26,404
I came Gujarat to ask for apology.
But now I want to live with you.

1210
01:53:30,537 --> 01:53:32,210
There is total five of
us in our group.

1211
01:53:32,305 --> 01:53:34,546
You, me, Gopi, Samma and Sheikh.

1212
01:53:35,175 --> 01:53:38,713
But now Sheikh is not around.
Feel so sad without him.

1213
01:53:38,812 --> 01:53:41,486
And at this point if you still
hide your love inside.

1214
01:53:41,614 --> 01:53:45,994
And get a hole as Ithayam Murali.
That will hurt us by thinking of it.

1215
01:53:46,085 --> 01:53:49,259
Pity her.
Just forgive and accept her.

1216
01:53:49,355 --> 01:53:52,336
Earlier it happened mistakenly.
Forgive and accept her.

1217
01:53:53,459 --> 01:53:55,666
Do feel that you're
Salman Khan or Sharukh Khan?

1218
01:53:55,795 --> 01:53:58,071
There are ppl working so hard
to get any normal girls.

1219
01:53:58,198 --> 01:54:01,509
She's look like an Hindi actress,
loving as a Tamil movie's sister.

1220
01:54:01,601 --> 01:54:03,342
Thinking like an English's wife.

1221
01:54:03,436 --> 01:54:05,382
Just tell her you love her
and enjoy your life!

1222
01:54:05,471 --> 01:54:07,075
But making scene to her!

1223
01:54:07,207 --> 01:54:08,345
Tell yes to her!

1224
01:54:10,343 --> 01:54:13,290
Are you mad?
What is less with this girl?

1225
01:54:13,479 --> 01:54:17,052
She's educated.
She's pretty.

1226
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:20,494
Even she's rich,
she's so humble.

1227
01:54:20,687 --> 01:54:22,667
And you are saying no to her!

1228
01:54:22,755 --> 01:54:27,602
Listen to mom, God only knock once.

1229
01:54:27,727 --> 01:54:32,331
She should live in our house!
Don't ignore her.

1230
01:54:32,332 --> 01:54:35,472
She will make your life better.

1231
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:40,173
Why must I beg you!
You are marrying her!

1232
01:54:40,273 --> 01:54:41,718
He will marry you!

1233
01:55:07,367 --> 01:55:08,345
Why is the tension?

1234
01:55:08,434 --> 01:55:10,710
Even love works for the ones
never talks or meet each others.

1235
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:14,349
But you have many thoughts
for your love, sure you will succeed!

1236
01:55:19,112 --> 01:55:21,592
Sir, my dad was
murdered 20 days back!

1237
01:55:21,714 --> 01:55:23,716
No witness at all from
your department.

1238
01:55:24,050 --> 01:55:27,224
Sir, will they inform and kill?
We are investigating!

1239
01:55:27,353 --> 01:55:31,699
Ya right! Did you manage to
arrest any suspect on this?

1240
01:55:31,791 --> 01:55:36,240
Not even a question to the suspect!
I've found this person using my ppl!

1241
01:55:37,597 --> 01:55:39,736
Is he the accused?
- He is the eye witness.

1242
01:55:40,099 --> 01:55:43,706
He saw the person who ran
from the murdered spot!

1243
01:55:43,803 --> 01:55:45,783
I even surrendered him to
police station.

1244
01:55:46,072 --> 01:55:49,519
Then they might kill him
and close the case.

1245
01:55:49,575 --> 01:55:51,282
That is why I brought him here.

1246
01:55:51,411 --> 01:55:53,721
He talks a lot!
- Which is too much?

1247
01:55:54,314 --> 01:55:57,056
You are careless just because
my father is a ex MLA.

1248
01:55:57,183 --> 01:55:58,287
What if he was MLA now,

1249
01:55:58,418 --> 01:56:00,227
Sure you have capture the
murderer and punish him!

1250
01:56:00,353 --> 01:56:01,491
Don't get tensed up.

1251
01:56:02,088 --> 01:56:03,328
Please be silent Mr. Ratnam.

1252
01:56:03,423 --> 01:56:06,131
Why they need to come here if you
did your work correctly?

1253
01:56:07,093 --> 01:56:09,266
The murder had not taken place
if you did your job well!

1254
01:56:09,462 --> 01:56:11,703
You're careless making
me to suspect you!

1255
01:56:12,632 --> 01:56:14,509
After this I will handle
this case by myself.

1256
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:17,979
Can you recognise the
person you saw? -Yes, sir.

1257
01:56:18,071 --> 01:56:21,348
Should I bring him to my place
and catch the person?

1258
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:24,012
No need.
I will settle this case fast by myself.

1259
01:56:24,143 --> 01:56:25,679
You go for ten days on leave.

1260
01:56:32,352 --> 01:56:33,592
Greetings bro.

1261
01:56:44,097 --> 01:56:47,078
Bro, better cut off the
problem when it is still small.

1262
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:49,578
If it gets bigger, it will cut us off.

1263
01:56:49,669 --> 01:56:51,512
We killed ex MLA.

1264
01:56:51,604 --> 01:56:55,108
Because of his son's pressure,
Commissioner took over the case.

1265
01:56:55,241 --> 01:56:56,982
Even Commissioner is suspecting me.

1266
01:56:57,176 --> 01:57:00,020
I will escape if anything happened.

1267
01:57:00,146 --> 01:57:01,921
After that, all of you shouldn't
be angry with me.

1268
01:57:02,715 --> 01:57:06,390
The eye witness is describe
about the kid perfectly.

1269
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:08,529
Commissioner surely will get the kid!

1270
01:57:08,654 --> 01:57:10,725
Be careful.
- Tell me where is the eye witness,

1271
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:12,503
<i>I will</i> take care of him!
- What are you talking about?

1272
01:57:13,292 --> 01:57:16,205
Who cares about the witness.
Problem will be solved once we kill the kid.

1273
01:57:16,496 --> 01:57:18,100
Why killing others?

1274
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:21,003
We can kill thousand ppl for money.

1275
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:23,271
But shouldn't avoid killing
because of love!

1276
01:57:25,204 --> 01:57:27,343
Commisioner have ordered his ppl to
seek all the youngsters in our area.

1277
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:28,951
He will sure get the kid.

1278
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:31,044
If the kid get caught,
Ravi will get caught too.

1279
01:57:31,177 --> 01:57:33,384
If Ravi get caught, all of
us get caught too.

1280
01:57:33,479 --> 01:57:36,358
It will be a waste for
all the effort we put.

1281
01:57:36,449 --> 01:57:38,326
Careful!
See you.

1282
01:57:44,457 --> 01:57:47,063
Heard that right.
He must die!

1283
01:57:47,193 --> 01:57:49,227
If we need to save few
life by killing one life,

1284
01:57:49,228 --> 01:57:50,228
Let it be.

1285
01:57:50,229 --> 01:57:51,970
Bro, he won't tell.

1286
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:58,580
Muruga, he's have love for ppl.
He thinks disgrace to kill a kid.

1287
01:57:59,372 --> 01:58:03,047
Even at this age, I don't care what
ever reason you give to avoid killing.

1288
01:58:03,342 --> 01:58:06,585
Why is he so care about him?
Is he your brother?

1289
01:58:08,147 --> 01:58:09,592
You do thejob.
- OK, bro.

1290
01:58:10,049 --> 01:58:13,053
No need!
<i>I will</i> do.

1291
01:58:13,419 --> 01:58:16,455
Believe in me.
- All this while I'm believing in you alone.

1292
01:58:16,456 --> 01:58:19,324
And always.
Who do I have besides you.

1293
01:58:19,325 --> 01:58:21,026
It's the situation making
us to do this.

1294
01:58:21,027 --> 01:58:23,007
This is normal in our work.
Kill him.

1295
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:25,374
OK, bro.

1296
01:58:41,447 --> 01:58:43,048
Who is this?
- Letchumy, it's me.

1297
01:58:43,049 --> 01:58:45,217
Is it you.
Are you fine?

1298
01:58:45,218 --> 01:58:46,618
You?
- I'm fine.

1299
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:48,286
Is Priya there?
- Yes, she is here.

1300
01:58:48,287 --> 01:58:49,287
Wait a minute.

1301
01:58:49,288 --> 01:58:50,266
Priya, it's your mom.

1302
01:58:51,557 --> 01:58:53,764
Priya, mom here.
- Why in sudden?

1303
01:58:54,193 --> 01:58:56,628
You are fine right?
Dad fine too right?

1304
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:57,607
We are fine.

1305
01:58:57,797 --> 01:58:59,831
When is your exam will ends.
- In two weeks time.

1306
01:58:59,832 --> 01:59:03,435
Can you come once finish your exam?
Father really wants to see you.

1307
01:59:03,436 --> 01:59:05,470
Why mom?
What happened to dad?

1308
01:59:05,471 --> 01:59:06,449
Is there any problem?

1309
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:11,452
Nothing like that.
Doctor asked him to do a minor surgery.

1310
01:59:14,013 --> 01:59:16,515
Want to talk with dad?
He's sleeping, you want me to wake him up?

1311
01:59:16,516 --> 01:59:18,496
Don't! I talk to him personally.

1312
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:21,620
I have a lot of things to talk to him.
- Do I need talk to the travel agent?

1313
01:59:21,621 --> 01:59:24,659
No, I will take care of it.
- OK, try to come fast.

1314
01:59:26,459 --> 01:59:28,996
What happened to your dad?
- Nothing.

1315
01:59:58,057 --> 01:59:59,365
I need to talk to you!

1316
02:00:01,060 --> 02:00:04,129
Walk!
- Where are you bringing me?

1317
02:00:04,130 --> 02:00:05,108
To hotel!

1318
02:00:06,065 --> 02:00:08,409
Let him go.
Wejust want to query him.

1319
02:00:10,002 --> 02:00:11,640
Better come!
- For what!

1320
02:00:13,506 --> 02:00:18,478
I did a big mistake!
But can't you forgive me?

1321
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:21,179
Or I really don't know how
to ask forgiveness?

1322
02:00:21,180 --> 02:00:22,781
Tell me!
What else I need to do?

1323
02:00:22,782 --> 02:00:24,227
Do you want me to knee
down and ask forgiveness?

1324
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:29,226
You just avoiding me,
not that you don't like me.

1325
02:00:29,488 --> 02:00:33,436
I know, I rushed in without
understands about your love that day.

1326
02:00:33,626 --> 02:00:35,493
But don't do the
same mistake now.

1327
02:00:35,494 --> 02:00:37,262
An enquiry in Commissioner's office.

1328
02:00:37,263 --> 02:00:38,630
Come!
- Let me go.

1329
02:00:38,631 --> 02:00:44,104
I have convinced your friends and mom.
Even I can convince my parents.

1330
02:00:45,104 --> 02:00:47,372
But how to convince you.

1331
02:00:47,373 --> 02:00:49,649
Smoking illegal cigarettes even
in this stinky place!

1332
02:00:51,811 --> 02:00:55,224
My dad is not feeling well.
I need to go to US.

1333
02:00:56,415 --> 02:00:59,828
<i>I will</i> wait for you on the
regular bus you used.

1334
02:01:01,120 --> 02:01:03,066
That is the place I saw you
in the first place.

1335
02:01:03,322 --> 02:01:07,361
I will always be with you, if you accept
my love and come to meet me.

1336
02:01:09,495 --> 02:01:12,163
If you didn't come.

You were the one asked us not to have
all this and not to involved.

1357
02:07:16,428 --> 02:07:18,529
You will need it.
Take it!

1358
02:07:18,530 --> 02:07:19,530
Don't understand.

1359
02:07:19,531 --> 02:07:22,467
Earlier you send me outstation
because I saw the murder.

1360
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:25,039
And now you're giving me
all these.

1361
02:07:26,538 --> 02:07:29,075
Won't you take ca re of me if
anything happen to me?

1362
02:07:30,376 --> 02:07:32,447

1364
02:07:50,095 --> 02:07:54,134

1365
02:08:04,043 --> 02:08:04,976

Going to steal your money

1369
02:08:29,334 --> 02:08:30,438
There is only one pocket?!

1370
02:08:31,503 --> 02:08:32,504
He did put it here!

1371
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:35,616
I did see him put here!

1372
02:08:38,343 --> 02:08:40,653
I don't understand anything.
What does he do?

1373
02:08:56,295 --> 02:08:57,569
Should just ask him?

1374
02:09:06,705 --> 02:09:08,372
What?
- I need to know something!

1375
02:09:08,373 --> 02:09:09,373
About what?

1376
02:09:09,374 --> 02:09:12,548
Where did your money
gone missing after you put,

1377
02:09:12,678 --> 02:09:14,946
Your money in your pocket
before you go to sleep?

1378
02:09:14,947 --> 02:09:17,248
Things which put in the pocket
must be in the pocket itself!

1379
02:09:17,249 --> 02:09:19,016
It's not.
It wasn't there when I try to get it.

1380
02:09:19,017 --> 02:09:21,252
How should it be there in my pocket?
- Then?

1381
02:09:21,253 --> 02:09:24,322
Try search in your pocket!
- In my pocket?

1382
02:09:24,323 --> 02:09:28,126
Yes, I will put in my pocket
in front of you.

1383
02:09:28,127 --> 02:09:33,338
After you fall asleep, I will change
the place and put in your pocket.

1384
02:09:33,632 --> 02:09:39,241
In the morning I will change it
back to mine before you wake up.

1385
02:09:39,438 --> 02:09:41,205
How?
- What how!

1386
02:09:41,206 --> 02:09:44,342
Why are you like this?
- Money is safety in a thief's hand.

1387
02:09:44,343 --> 02:09:49,343
I just thought you're useless.
Even you have a brain.

1388
02:09:49,581 --> 02:09:52,183
He is smart.
- Only this much you know about your dad?

1389
02:09:52,184 --> 02:09:54,352
Then?
- Try put your hand in your pocket.

1390
02:09:54,353 --> 02:09:56,458
You put some coins inside?
- Just put your hand there.

1391
02:10:04,129 --> 02:10:06,597
What is this key?
- Go and see from our balcony.

1392
02:10:06,598 --> 02:10:08,800
Why are you making a scene?
Mom move a bit.

1393
02:10:08,801 --> 02:10:10,747
Have he bought an old
secondhand bike?

1394
02:10:22,581 --> 02:10:26,117
Your mom told me you
behave good last a month.

1395
02:10:26,118 --> 02:10:28,820
Even I aware of it,
you have changed.

1396
02:10:28,821 --> 02:10:33,024
Since you have decide to live a good life,
it's my responsible to help you.

1397
02:10:33,025 --> 02:10:36,427
We will only be happy
when you are happy.

1398
02:10:36,428 --> 02:10:39,739
After this you should
only ride this auto.

1399
02:10:49,708 --> 02:10:53,144
Thanks a lot dad.
I have spoken badly to you.

1400
02:10:53,145 --> 02:10:56,456
It's nothing between dad and his son.
Go and ride.

1401
02:11:22,808 --> 02:11:25,084
Is this a new auto?
Yes, sis.

1402
02:11:33,385 --> 02:11:36,387
Is it new?
- Yes, my father bought for me.

1403
02:11:36,388 --> 02:11:38,698
Come, let's go for a ride.
- Wait a minute.

1404
02:11:46,598 --> 02:11:49,133
It is new.
This is the latest model.

1405
02:11:49,134 --> 02:11:52,637
Look here.
All the convenience is here.

1406
02:11:52,638 --> 02:11:55,373
My father have give
me a new life.

1407
02:11:55,374 --> 02:12:00,084
Let's go for ride and have fun.

1408
02:12:03,448 --> 02:12:05,985
I'm so happy today.

1409
02:12:07,152 --> 02:12:11,225
It have been so long to
know my father's heart.

1410
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:15,426
Thanks God, He make me to
understand about my dad sooner.

1411
02:12:15,427 --> 02:12:18,229
But only you don't get to understand.
- What should I understand?

1412
02:12:18,230 --> 02:12:21,599
About Priya.
You don't understands her.

1413
02:12:21,600 --> 02:12:24,502
Let it go.
- Why want to let it go!

1414
02:12:24,503 --> 02:12:26,244
Was it wrong when she got mad?

1415
02:12:27,372 --> 02:12:31,616
Logically, girls do get tensed if any boys
ask her out by showing a condom!

1416
02:12:31,710 --> 02:12:33,348
It is wrong if they didn't get mad.

1417
02:12:33,545 --> 02:12:35,279
So, she will tell that
she doesn't know me!

1418
02:12:35,280 --> 02:12:39,550
All based on situation.
Love can occur after fighting.

1419
02:12:39,551 --> 02:12:41,531
Shouldn't fight after start to love.

1420
02:12:41,820 --> 02:12:45,597
Let's think about this.
What is your status and hers?

1421
02:12:46,358 --> 02:12:48,304
How many times she
came to your house?

1422
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:52,269
Did she came every where
without believing in you?

1423
02:12:52,631 --> 02:12:55,800
She's a good person.
She loves you a lot.

1424
02:12:55,801 --> 02:12:59,503
If I pick a ﬂowers in this auto,
sure have the ﬂower smell.

1425
02:12:59,504 --> 02:13:01,772
And if I pick salt fishes,
sure salt fish smell we get.

1426
02:13:01,773 --> 02:13:04,108
If I pick rubbish,
then it will smell rubbish.

1427
02:13:04,109 --> 02:13:08,746
The smell sure will gone if
we wash this auto.

1428
02:13:08,747 --> 02:13:11,782
The issue is not in the transport.
It's what you picking up.

1429
02:13:11,783 --> 02:13:15,697
So just throw what you have in
your heart and start a new one.

1430
02:13:16,054 --> 02:13:21,094
For me she's your future and everything.
Do you understand?

1431
02:13:22,794 --> 02:13:24,171
What do you want me to do?

1432
02:13:24,363 --> 02:13:27,503
Go and meet her with the
things you bought for her.

1433
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:30,534
Who doesn't do mistakes.
But we must forgive them.

1434
02:13:30,535 --> 02:13:31,535
That is a good human being.

1435
02:13:31,536 --> 02:13:36,076
Do you understand?
Even I have changed, what wrong with you!

1436
02:13:43,382 --> 02:13:45,020
Everything will be fine.

1437
02:14:41,339 --> 02:14:43,478
Won't he come?
- He will come right?

1438
02:14:44,009 --> 02:14:45,420
He will come!

1439
02:15:16,308 --> 02:15:17,218
What is it?

1440
02:15:59,084 --> 02:16:01,360
Won't you take care of me if
something going to happen to me?

1441
02:16:02,487 --> 02:16:04,728
I don't need all this when I have you.

1442
02:16:44,196 --> 02:16:46,730
Why are you so early then before!

1443
02:16:46,731 --> 02:16:48,566
Don't take the bus first.
Go when I told you so.

1444
02:16:48,567 --> 02:16:50,601
Why are you stopping him!

1445
02:16:50,602 --> 02:16:53,378
It's getting late!

1446
02:17:22,367 --> 02:17:25,211
Faster!
Jump in!

1447
02:17:46,057 --> 02:17:49,627
Come here.
You do it if he doesn't.

1448
02:17:49,628 --> 02:17:50,766
OK bro.

1449
02:19:45,577 --> 02:19:49,024
Look at us!
- Only now I came!

1450
02:20:11,736 --> 02:20:14,740
If I didn't call you,
You wouldn't be here.

1451
02:20:30,622 --> 02:20:30,954
Don't leave me!

1452
02:20:30,955 --> 02:20:32,263
Don't leave me!

1453
02:20:41,366 --> 02:20:42,606
Look at me!

1454
02:22:05,717 --> 02:22:10,257
- The end .
