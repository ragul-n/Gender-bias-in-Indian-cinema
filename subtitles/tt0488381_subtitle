1
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:27,921
Corporate - the professional
way of conducting business

2
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:32,594
The owner of a corporate entity
can either be a sole businessman...

3
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,734
or a lot of shareholders together

4
00:02:37,604 --> 00:02:42,473
The sole objective of every
business is the same - profit

5
00:02:42,776 --> 00:02:45,404
Also called the
bottom-line in the corporate world

6
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:48,740
To improve upon their bottom lines...

7
00:02:48,815 --> 00:02:50,282
...professionals of these corporates...

8
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:53,478
often resort to a lot of
unprofessional methods, too

9
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:57,552
Our story revolves
around two corporates...

10
00:02:57,791 --> 00:03:01,625
who are traditional rivals
in the food products business

11
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,290
The Sehgal Group of Industries...

12
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,292
and the Marwah Group of Industries

13
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:11,497
They're always launching new
Products to upstage each other

14
00:03:12,806 --> 00:03:16,640
In the recently concluded elections,
the party backed by the Sehgals...

15
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,302
romped home to power

16
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,314
While Marwah was dejected...

17
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:27,313
Mr... Vinay Sehgal
was obviously overjoyed

18
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:33,453
The Finance Minister has personally
invited him to New Delhi, after all.

19
00:03:34,394 --> 00:03:37,921
Navin my contestant was right.
We backed the right horse.

20
00:03:38,498 --> 00:03:41,990
Ashwini has bagged the
finance Portfolio... that's a plus

21
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:45,337
Poor Marwah. It's
gonna be difficult for him.

22
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:48,334
After the State, he's going to
be kicked out of the Centre too

23
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,343
Congratulations. - Thank you. Thank
you very much for your support.

24
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:53,345
I am very happy.

25
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:59,007
The party has entrusted a
huge responsibility to me

26
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,683
Oh yes... Vinay, there's a
nice proposal for your company

27
00:04:04,357 --> 00:04:05,415
Yes?

28
00:04:05,492 --> 00:04:07,357
There's going to be
a major change in...

29
00:04:07,427 --> 00:04:09,361
...the Foreign Direct Investment policy

30
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:11,357
The American food giant,
Friscon International...

31
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:15,367
are looking for collaborators in India

32
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:19,365
Their Asia Pacific chief
is here in Delhi right now

33
00:04:19,873 --> 00:04:22,865
I've spoken to him
for a tie-up with you

34
00:04:24,711 --> 00:04:29,375
Make sure you meet him.
- Certainly... thanks

35
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:44,526
This is going to be
a great partnership.

36
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,390
Friscon India Ltd. Will be
a joint-venture company...

37
00:04:48,468 --> 00:04:49,935
which will manufacture
snack foods and soft drinks

38
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:54,399
The Sehgal Group will hold
44 per cent of shares...

39
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:59,536
Friscon Incorporated U.S.A.,
will hold 26 per cent...

40
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:02,404
and 30 per cent will be held
by Indian financial institutions

41
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,414
Is it going to be a
closely held company?

42
00:05:06,486 --> 00:05:09,421
Very soon, the Sehgal Group and
the Indian financial institutions...

43
00:05:09,489 --> 00:05:13,425
will divest 8 per cent of their
holdings through a public issue

44
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:18,954
And today I am very proud to
be associated with Friscon.

45
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,558
Thank you all.

46
00:05:39,953 --> 00:05:43,719
Good morning sir.
Congratulations on the Friscon deal.

47
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,781
Thank you!

48
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:48,792
It's a clincher.
- Well, let's see.

49
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:50,454
How did your meetings in Singapore go?

50
00:05:50,797 --> 00:05:52,458
Both the deals are closed, sir

51
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:56,593
12 consignments in the next 6 months.
That's 270 million in the kitty

52
00:05:58,972 --> 00:06:01,463
So see you tomorrow at
the Cll meeting, okay?

53
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:02,872
Okay, sir. I'll see you there

54
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:06,467
Hi Nishi.
- Hi Andy, what's been happening?

55
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:09,606
As usual. There's a
backlog of 2 weeks, Nishi

56
00:06:09,683 --> 00:06:11,810
I've kept the papers on your desk.
- Fine

57
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:15,612
Have you sent out the emails
for tomorrow's Cll meeting?

58
00:06:15,689 --> 00:06:16,883
Yeah, all done.

59
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:20,622
That's great. - And by the way
that new girl, Megha, she is come.

60
00:06:20,694 --> 00:06:22,753
Okay, send her in 10 minutes.
- All right.

61
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:32,494
Send Anmol inside

62
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:36,908
So Megha... are you clear
about the job functions?

63
00:06:37,577 --> 00:06:39,636
Yes ma'am.
- No ma'am here.

64
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:42,507
We work together on a first-name basis

65
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:52,515
I mean... Nishi.
- That's better

66
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,526
One thing I'd like to tell you.
When you were featured...

67
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,533
in the Business Today magazine
as the best female executive...

68
00:07:01,801 --> 00:07:03,666
I was extremely proud.

69
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:06,531
I have graduated from your
own management school and...

70
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:11,873
I just hope, I'm as
successful as you are, some day.

71
00:07:11,945 --> 00:07:13,537
That's very nice Megha. Thanks.

72
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:16,948
I hope I can live up
to your expectations.

73
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:19,084
Welcome aboard Friscon.

74
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,687
Hi Anmol.
- Hi Nishi

75
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,556
How are you?
- Good, thank you.

76
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:31,887
She's Megha... Megha Apte.
And that's Anmol Rawat

77
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,101
Megha's joining us as
assistant manager, operations

78
00:07:36,636 --> 00:07:38,570
Would you like to show her around?

79
00:07:38,638 --> 00:07:41,038
Yes, of course.
- Well... yes...

80
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:45,571
terms and conditions of Friscon,
marketing... please go through it

81
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,046
And do involve Megha too.
- Done.

82
00:07:51,651 --> 00:07:53,778
I hope you enjoy working with us.
- Thanks. - All the best.

83
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:00,650
Yes, Navin?

84
00:08:01,661 --> 00:08:03,128
Okay Megha. Open an Excel file
of Friscon's...

85
00:08:03,196 --> 00:08:04,595
...region-wise distribution network...

86
00:08:04,664 --> 00:08:08,065
and get a print-out
in table form, okay?

87
00:08:09,669 --> 00:08:12,001
Anmol. Can I have a coffee please?

88
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:16,804
Coffee...? Of course. But
it's Machine-made... not nice.

89
00:08:18,945 --> 00:08:21,607
If you want to have good coffee,
there's a coffee-shop close by...

90
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:24,081
we can go over, if you wish

91
00:08:25,685 --> 00:08:27,880
Don't you think you're a bit too fast?

92
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:32,624
Fast...? To be honest, madam...

93
00:08:32,692 --> 00:08:35,627
the rest of the guys in the
office are by far faster than me

94
00:08:37,964 --> 00:08:40,159
Anyway. Hey Lobo.
- Yes sir? - Listen.

95
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:43,629
...treat the lady to some
coffee from the machine

96
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:52,635
See? A new girl arrives and the
boss starts playing Romeo immediately

97
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:56,773
You're no less a Romeo, are you?
What difference between you and him?

98
00:08:57,717 --> 00:09:00,982
Don't you ever
compare me with the bosses

99
00:09:01,721 --> 00:09:03,916
There's this great difference
between the boss and the orderly

100
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,855
What difference?
- Look...

101
00:09:06,059 --> 00:09:10,996
in a shift of nine to six,
when you stop working at four...

102
00:09:11,064 --> 00:09:15,660
you're the peon. Those
that start working at four...

103
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:18,670
are the bosses! You dig?
- You're right

104
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:21,803
Now stop raving and
make some coffee... go on

105
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:29,943
In your gain lies our gain

106
00:09:31,017 --> 00:09:33,679
Make as much gains as you can...

107
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:37,687
and also make the state and
the nation gain in the process

108
00:09:38,091 --> 00:09:40,150
That's the objective of our party

109
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,695
There was so much disagreement
over the disinvestment programme

110
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:49,164
But what will the opposition do,
If not disagree with us...?

111
00:09:50,203 --> 00:09:53,832
I had a simple argument.
The government...

112
00:09:53,907 --> 00:09:56,102
...must provide the industrialists...

113
00:09:56,175 --> 00:09:59,042
a proper atmosphere to set up industry

114
00:10:00,246 --> 00:10:03,704
For example, the Maharashtra
Bottling and Confectioneries...

115
00:10:04,884 --> 00:10:08,251
a public-sector undertaking.
What does it do...?

116
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:11,848
Makes cakes, biscuits and soft drinks

117
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:18,924
And the Maharashtra Two-wheeler Ltd.
Another public-sector company

118
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,735
The government, I believe,
ought to show the way to people...

119
00:10:23,803 --> 00:10:27,398
making scooters and motorcycles
is not the government's job

120
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:32,742
In any case, government officials
prefer to travel in four-wheelers...

121
00:10:32,812 --> 00:10:34,746
what good is the
manufacture of two-wheelers?

122
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,751
And thus, our government has decided
to sell all public-sector units...

123
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,345
to the private sector

124
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:49,752
I will not waste any
more of your precious time

125
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:56,366
Else, you will accuse me of delivering
a speech even at the Cll meeting

126
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,104
Glory to India. Glory to Maharashtra

127
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:11,106
What did your State
Finance Minister say?

128
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,311
He made great promises for the
corporate world. - Will he keep them?

129
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:18,323
Whether it's India or America Steve,
politicians are politicians.

130
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:30,793
This PSU will benefit our
company's expansion plans immensely

131
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,397
Right, sir. And their
product-line matches that of ours

132
00:11:34,874 --> 00:11:38,810
Good evening. This is Devyani Bakshi
from Corporate News and I'm here at...

133
00:11:38,878 --> 00:11:40,812
...the Cll meeting tonight with
Steve Jones from Friscon...

134
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,472
...lnternational in an exclusive.

135
00:11:42,882 --> 00:11:46,340
Hi Steve.
- Hi, how are you today? - Very well.

136
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:48,216
To start with could you throw
some light on your...

137
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,221
...tie-up with Sehgal Foods?

138
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:53,816
Well, Friscon is world
number 1 in aerated drinks.

139
00:11:53,893 --> 00:11:56,953
And we control nearly 55 per
cent of the international market.

140
00:11:57,163 --> 00:12:00,826
So even in India we feel like the
soft drinks segment will provide...

141
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,834
...a huge per cent of benefit.

142
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,296
That's exactly what we are
working at with out with Mr... Sehgal.

143
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:06,838
This Maharashtra Bottling and
Confectionary...

144
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:08,237
...looks like a good proposition.

145
00:12:08,307 --> 00:12:11,174
Huh? Nishi?

146
00:12:11,244 --> 00:12:13,838
In fact we qualify
in all criteria, sir.

147
00:12:15,181 --> 00:12:16,842
Will you take the last page?

148
00:12:19,352 --> 00:12:23,118
That's the criteria of corruption.
We emerge tops at that too.

149
00:12:23,923 --> 00:12:27,051
What is that saying, corruption is
an infallible symptom...

150
00:12:27,126 --> 00:12:29,060
...of a constitutional liberty.

151
00:12:29,362 --> 00:12:31,455
We are truly liberated.

152
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:34,866
Cheers to that. I'll just come.
- Okay.

153
00:12:35,468 --> 00:12:38,869
Work on Gulabrao because I have
a feeling Marwah is going...

154
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:40,872
...to move in big time on this piece.

155
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:46,468
I don't see you at the club nowadays

156
00:12:46,946 --> 00:12:48,004
I was out of town

157
00:12:49,382 --> 00:12:52,146
Singapore right? How was the trip?

158
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:53,943
It was nice

159
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:57,889
I'm told the Sehgal's are
starting a regional office there?

160
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,156
Parvez, I thought you were doing
well as the CEO of Marwah Industries

161
00:13:03,496 --> 00:13:06,090
Since when have you taken
up full-time detective work?

162
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,096
Come on Nishi. You
don't have to be so acidic.

163
00:13:11,304 --> 00:13:14,432
To keep myself abreast with
competition is part of my profession

164
00:13:15,074 --> 00:13:18,510
But the tie-up with
Friscon was a great surprise

165
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:21,175
I don't want to talk with you now.

166
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:23,912
Exactly why I tell you, Nishi...

167
00:13:24,984 --> 00:13:27,578
Always mix a bit of
pleasure with business

168
00:13:29,422 --> 00:13:34,587
Believe me. It's a
highly potent mixture.

169
00:13:34,994 --> 00:13:37,121
You sound like a
confused scientist to me.

170
00:13:48,441 --> 00:13:52,935
Kumar, everybody's drinking
And having a great time...

171
00:13:53,012 --> 00:13:54,536
it's such a shame for us!

172
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:57,946
Do you drink?
- Yes

173
00:13:58,017 --> 00:13:59,416
Also eat non-veg?
- Sure

174
00:14:02,355 --> 00:14:04,220
Hey you... come here

175
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:06,948
You know who we are, right?

176
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:12,497
Of course, sir.
- Here's what you'll do

177
00:14:13,032 --> 00:14:16,229
Two bottles of Black Label.
Two or three grilled chickens

178
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:23,170
Keep it in the van behind that
Guy's car there... hurry it up

179
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:30,973
Kumar, you know your way around!
- Just keep watching

180
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,986
So you're coming with me tonight?
- It's difficult to make it, Mukesh

181
00:14:35,488 --> 00:14:39,322
My husband's returning early tonight.
- Make some excuse

182
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:41,651
My wife has also left for Shirdi today

183
00:14:42,161 --> 00:14:45,653
There's nobody at home.
- But my husband...?

184
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:52,130
Say you have a presentation.
That You have to work all night

185
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,002
In any case, I'm giving
you an out of turn promotion

186
00:14:59,078 --> 00:15:03,276
I know.
- Okay? I'll wait for you.

187
00:15:07,086 --> 00:15:09,020
What Marwah? Your
rival Has entered into...

188
00:15:09,088 --> 00:15:11,022
...a tie-up with such a big company

189
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:14,491
The Sehgals are in the
habit of taking big strides

190
00:15:15,194 --> 00:15:18,027
From the very beginning, we
have always moved at our own pace

191
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:23,034
So you want to be a tortoise.
Slow and steady wins the race. What?

192
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:27,028
Hello, Gulabrao...
- Joe! How are you?

193
00:15:27,106 --> 00:15:31,042
I was good. Till now.
- Have you met Mr... Marwah?

194
00:15:31,377 --> 00:15:34,574
Mr... Marwah. Chairman of the
Marwah Group of Industries.

195
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:40,542
This is Joe Rajan. He's into corporate
surveillance and intelligence

196
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:44,589
He's a very useful guy
in your line of work

197
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:46,250
My card sir.

198
00:15:49,562 --> 00:15:52,554
Nice meeting you sir.
- We'll keep in touch.

199
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,125
Please come...

200
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,609
Mom, from college
I'm going to the gym

201
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,620
Keep in touch okay?
- Okay bye Mom.

202
00:16:15,688 --> 00:16:17,280
Have a good day.
- Okay bye Dad.

203
00:16:17,356 --> 00:16:19,415
Let this be... I'll handle it

204
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:26,088
Vinay... I hope you remember I
have this exhibition and auction?

205
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:30,101
The world's top painters and
artists will be participating

206
00:16:30,503 --> 00:16:33,438
First time ever in India.

207
00:16:35,174 --> 00:16:38,632
Well... there's something more.
- What?

208
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:41,508
Ritesh is coming back from London

209
00:16:45,451 --> 00:16:46,577
I see

210
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:52,523
I was wondering... this new
project is such a huge one...

211
00:16:52,591 --> 00:16:55,116
if you could involve him too...?

212
00:16:56,462 --> 00:16:58,453
Why doesn't your
brother talk to me directly?

213
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,463
Maybe he's afraid of you

214
00:17:08,207 --> 00:17:11,665
Don't you think we ought
to give him another chance?

215
00:17:13,212 --> 00:17:14,270
Let's see

216
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:20,615
Yeah okay. Everyone
deserves a second chance.

217
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,483
And he's my wife's brother.
I'll have to do something about it

218
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:26,149
Don't worry, I'll fix it

219
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,556
3 lakh bottles per day.

220
00:17:28,327 --> 00:17:29,760
A huge water reservoir.

221
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,159
Believe me sir. This PSU is worth...

222
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,225
...every rupee we spend.

223
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:40,564
Sir, MBC happens to
be in a backward area

224
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:44,708
The state government is bound to
give tax and excise concessions...

225
00:17:44,777 --> 00:17:46,176
to the company that
takes over this unit

226
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:50,315
The price of a soft drink will
come down from rupees 5 to rupees 3

227
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,510
And our margin will be more
than double. - That's true

228
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:59,689
In addition to that, if
we acquire this PSU...

229
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,387
we don't need to set
up a new bottling plant

230
00:18:03,396 --> 00:18:06,194
Our capital expenditure
will be reduced to half

231
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,330
The valuation of the plant and
machinery alone is about 6.3 billion

232
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:15,204
I want an accurate valuation
of this PSU in Maharashtra

233
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,346
Remember, there is 1500
acres of land around this PSU

234
00:18:22,548 --> 00:18:23,742
That too, in the industrial belt

235
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:28,215
I have details in this report,
sir. Of the 1500 acres of land...

236
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:31,848
about 600 acres of
land is agricultural

237
00:18:32,792 --> 00:18:35,283
Jhunjhunwala and Bajaj are
bound to bid for the MBC, no doubt

238
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:39,895
But Anand Dahiya will be
a very strong contender

239
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,492
And above all, he is
very close to Mr... Gulabrao.

240
00:18:43,369 --> 00:18:49,535
This PSU is very critical for the
further expansion of the Marwah Group

241
00:18:49,608 --> 00:18:53,567
Get cracking Hansa.
- Okay sir.

242
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:55,644
Parvez. Immediately.
- Right away sir.

243
00:18:56,649 --> 00:19:01,916
The Minister Gulabrao announced
a benchmark price of 9.5 billion

244
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,787
That means, the minimum
bid will be 10 billion

245
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:07,857
Right. And there are several
requirements for the bidding companies

246
00:19:08,461 --> 00:19:12,261
I think only six companies in
India will be able to qualify

247
00:19:12,998 --> 00:19:14,329
Come to think of it sir.

248
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,758
If there's anyone
who can compete with...

249
00:19:16,836 --> 00:19:17,928
...Sehgal Group, it's the Marwah Group

250
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,568
But after Friscon,
we are far ahead sir.

251
00:19:22,842 --> 00:19:25,470
Folks, put things in
the right perspective.

252
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:28,945
Friscon is prepared
to spend an extra...

253
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:31,278
...100 million US
dollars on this project...

254
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,547
...if we can pull off the PSU.

255
00:19:35,754 --> 00:19:38,689
That's awfully sweet of you Steve.

256
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,281
I am sure there's an incentive
for all of us here.

257
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:41,621
Now with your kind permission,
I'd like to make...

258
00:19:41,694 --> 00:19:42,820
...an announcement to the whole team.

259
00:19:44,563 --> 00:19:47,498
My brother-in-law,
Ritesh will be joining us.

260
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:50,700
Oh outstanding.
- As Senior Vice-President...

261
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,301
...for this particular project.

262
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,371
Well that'll be all. Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

263
00:19:57,977 --> 00:20:00,502
Steve, what are you doing for lunch?
- Thai food and Martini? - No, no.

264
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,644
Come with me. I want
you to come with me...

265
00:20:02,715 --> 00:20:04,706
...and try a special
delicacy from Maharashtra.

266
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,450
Lobsters. Yeah,
yeah. Let's go. Let's go.

267
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,851
It's delicious, you'll love it.

268
00:20:08,921 --> 00:20:10,320
You've never tasted anything
like that before.

269
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:12,924
Bye.
- Bye.

270
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:42,679
Every moment... this is life

271
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:54,966
Every moment... this is life

272
00:20:56,902 --> 00:21:01,566
Every moment that was yesterday,
is there this day, too

273
00:21:02,841 --> 00:21:05,776
One moment, yours...

274
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:09,376
one moment, mine

275
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:15,012
One moment, yours...

276
00:21:15,454 --> 00:21:18,389
one moment, mine

277
00:21:19,124 --> 00:21:24,790
Let's merge these
moments and make our lives

278
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:29,934
Every moment... this is life

279
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:36,898
Every moment that was yesterday,
is there this day, too

280
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:15,577
A million dreams our eyes weave

281
00:22:22,187 --> 00:22:27,921
A million dreams our eyes weave

282
00:22:28,193 --> 00:22:33,529
It's only when we march
ahead that we reach our goals

283
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:40,731
In loneliness...

284
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:49,470
in loneliness... you are with me

285
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:55,482
in loneliness... you are with me

286
00:22:57,022 --> 00:23:01,220
Every moment... this is life

287
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:08,495
Every moment that was yesterday,
is there this day, too

288
00:23:48,607 --> 00:23:50,199
Coming... coming

289
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:25,575
Come.

290
00:24:27,646 --> 00:24:28,772
This is for you.

291
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:37,088
So... what's the gossip nowadays?

292
00:24:38,123 --> 00:24:40,091
Gossip? What gossip?

293
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,652
They must be talking already. Here
Comes the boss's brother-in-law...

294
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,664
to sink another company

295
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:51,666
And they're not wrong either

296
00:24:53,872 --> 00:24:55,737
A loss of 1.7 billion
in London and then...

297
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:58,743
the complete failure
of the fast-food chain

298
00:24:59,611 --> 00:25:03,012
Ritesh, you went to London
to set up your own business

299
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:06,607
It's okay if that
venture didn't work out

300
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,216
You at least put in your effort

301
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:13,622
That's what you say. That's
not how the others look at it

302
00:25:14,226 --> 00:25:18,162
Ritesh, when we met for the
first time five years ago...

303
00:25:19,765 --> 00:25:21,289
I was going through a
terribly trying time

304
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,700
You were the one who told me then...

305
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:28,171
Either spend your lifetime
looking back at your failures...

306
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,832
or move on in life

307
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:35,710
You've now arrived in Friscon.
It's such a great opportunity

308
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:39,978
I tell you today.
Either spend a lifetime...

309
00:25:40,052 --> 00:25:42,646
...looking back at your failures...

310
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:45,121
or use this opportunity to move on

311
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:52,727
Okay.

312
00:26:09,214 --> 00:26:10,977
Hello.
- Hi Vinay. - How are you?

313
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:13,674
How are you?
- I'm good. Where are you going?

314
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,684
Off to the gym. But you relax.

315
00:26:17,956 --> 00:26:20,754
Feel comfortable. - I'll be okay.
- Wilson? - Yes, ma'am?

316
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:21,884
Take care of sir.

317
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,860
Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

318
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:25,356
See you later. Take care.
- Bye. - Bye.

319
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:28,692
Give me a call, huh?
- Yeah.

320
00:26:31,436 --> 00:26:32,767
I'll let you know.

321
00:26:38,443 --> 00:26:39,842
Hi.
- Hi.

322
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:41,774
How are you?
- I'm fine.

323
00:26:45,284 --> 00:26:48,720
I'll take a shower and join you,
okay? - Okay. - Okay.

324
00:26:58,263 --> 00:27:01,255
Did you talk to the astrologer?
- Yes

325
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:05,735
There was no network for two days.
I spoke to him in Ujjain today

326
00:27:06,405 --> 00:27:09,397
He said, since today is Wednesday,
I must wear the sapphire

327
00:27:22,321 --> 00:27:26,189
It's her sixth month. I must go
to Delhi for her fertility rites

328
00:27:27,826 --> 00:27:31,159
I've called her over so many times.
But going to Delhi...

329
00:27:32,965 --> 00:27:36,162
Is it necessary to go there?
The ritual can be performed here

330
00:27:36,501 --> 00:27:37,832
She's our only daughter

331
00:27:41,239 --> 00:27:42,365
Let me think

332
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,769
Tell your son-in-law to go
slow on his hobby of hunting game

333
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,041
He has been asked to
strictly keep off stripping them

334
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:53,443
I'll have a word with him

335
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:57,784
There's an exhibition at Anita
Jaitley's art-gallery this evening

336
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:00,991
I hope you're coming?
- I'll try to

337
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:07,059
When you called this morning,
I was with Deepa

338
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:09,790
She suspected it was
you I was talking to

339
00:28:11,903 --> 00:28:16,863
Lobo... you see that mare?
- Tanaaz? What about her?

340
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:20,073
Earlier, she used to play
along with just about anybody

341
00:28:20,545 --> 00:28:23,810
But now, she's seen
only in Tyagi's company

342
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:26,540
What do you think is cooking?
- Jhandu...

343
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:29,351
Iooks like I need to explain
it to you at the corporate level

344
00:28:30,455 --> 00:28:35,085
Earlier, she was a public enterprise.
So she went with just about anyone

345
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:40,361
She's now in the private domain.
So she goes only with Tyagi, okay?

346
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:44,100
Know what? I've heard the bosses
say it so often at meetings...

347
00:28:45,237 --> 00:28:48,229
Let's sleep over the issue

348
00:28:48,974 --> 00:28:52,137
What issue they come up with
after they sleep, I have no idea

349
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:55,969
Now pin it up quickly. Else,
there'll be another issue!

350
00:28:56,314 --> 00:28:58,179
45 per cent of the
soft drink market is...

351
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,241
...concentrated in the western region

352
00:29:00,952 --> 00:29:02,852
So this PSU is strategically located

353
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:07,448
Okay, what plans do we have
for state wise product launches?

354
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:12,387
We'll first launch wafers and
crunchies and later, soft drinks

355
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:15,864
Which means, we'll first
feed the public fried stuff...

356
00:29:15,934 --> 00:29:19,165
and when they feel thirsty, we
sell our soft-drinks to them

357
00:29:19,938 --> 00:29:21,064
You could say that, sir

358
00:29:22,607 --> 00:29:26,509
Okay... who's our closest
rival in this PSU acquisition?

359
00:29:28,413 --> 00:29:31,075
The Marwah Group.
Our traditional rivals

360
00:29:33,151 --> 00:29:36,882
At the moment, they're thinking
of making mineral water at the PSU

361
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:41,148
I see... when is the
public issue of Friscon due?

362
00:29:41,893 --> 00:29:44,885
With the product launch.
In another six months

363
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,955
March?
- Yeah, just about.

364
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,963
The shares are much sought after

365
00:29:51,636 --> 00:29:56,573
The bookmakers are quoting
350 to 400 in the gray market

366
00:29:57,542 --> 00:29:59,908
Okay, so Navin?

367
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:02,038
What's next on the agenda?

368
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:06,507
There's a meeting with the State
Finance Minister. Gulabrao Ingle

369
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:11,317
We have about 35,000 retail outlets...

370
00:30:11,389 --> 00:30:17,328
and our company provides
employment to roughly 800,000 people

371
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:20,122
Sir Friscon India is
an alliance between...

372
00:30:20,198 --> 00:30:22,928
...two of the world's
biggest consumer food giants.

373
00:30:23,001 --> 00:30:26,937
Yes, I know. - Sir, we
have great respect for you...

374
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:29,997
and would like to take
care of you in every respect

375
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:34,938
No, never mind that. A
PSU is national property

376
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:39,143
We'll take a decision after we
have looked into all the aspects

377
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:43,353
And our government
treats everybody equally

378
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:48,959
There is no favouritism. But
go ahead, file your bid...

379
00:30:49,027 --> 00:30:52,087
do not worry. I'm here...
I'll take care

380
00:30:54,699 --> 00:30:56,030
Hail India, Hail Maharashtra

381
00:30:56,434 --> 00:31:02,566
Does business need politics more?
Or does politics need business?

382
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:04,635
It's a question worth pondering

383
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:08,178
As soon as the
disinvestment plan in the...

384
00:31:08,246 --> 00:31:09,975
...public sector unit was announced...

385
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:11,310
business groups were
desperate to acquire it

386
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:14,314
The executives of Marwah and Sehgal...

387
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:17,378
began working out the
profits the PSU would yield

388
00:31:18,056 --> 00:31:21,116
In order to
strengthen their positions...

389
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:25,152
all business groups got
together to make their best bids

390
00:31:26,198 --> 00:31:30,635
But Gulabrao represented a
different political party in the state

391
00:31:31,636 --> 00:31:34,196
It was difficult to
gauge from his mood...

392
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:37,002
as to whom he would
entrust this PSU to

393
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:42,008
Sir, we've offered Jhunjhunwala's
3.3 billion for a complete buy off

394
00:31:42,214 --> 00:31:44,273
Plus, distribution in the south.
- Have they agreed?

395
00:31:44,516 --> 00:31:46,006
Of course.
- Perfect

396
00:31:46,084 --> 00:31:50,521
Please have the agreement ready.
Parvez will take a look tomorrow...

397
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:52,022
and we have a meeting
the day after tomorrow

398
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:00,426
Shirley...
- Yes, sir?

399
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:04,158
This deal file of Jhunjhunwala's is
very important. Put it away safely

400
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:07,432
I'll need this file tomorrow morning.
- Okay sir.

401
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:26,181
Hi Nishi.

402
00:32:27,792 --> 00:32:29,123
Hi Pervez.

403
00:32:31,162 --> 00:32:33,062
You're getting more and more
beautiful with every passing day

404
00:32:34,266 --> 00:32:35,392
What's the secret?

405
00:32:36,334 --> 00:32:38,393
Keep guessing.
- Yeah.

406
00:32:38,536 --> 00:32:39,662
I will.

407
00:32:41,339 --> 00:32:44,604
Nishi, don't you think you're
wasting your time at the Sehgal Group?

408
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,741
Why don't you join us? We
Could give you a good offer

409
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:52,207
But I'm very happy with the Sehgals.

410
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:54,277
Really?

411
00:32:57,489 --> 00:33:01,721
What is it that keeps you
glued to the Sehgal Group?

412
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:05,159
Is it Ritesh?

413
00:33:07,766 --> 00:33:09,097
Maybe.

414
00:33:10,402 --> 00:33:11,699
May I ask you something, Parvez?

415
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:16,096
What is it with your house
that you can't stop flirting...

416
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:19,109
...whenever you see a girl?
Is it a bad vibe?

417
00:33:20,578 --> 00:33:21,772
Is it a bad marriage?

418
00:33:22,314 --> 00:33:24,373
Or an average looking,
narrow-minded wife?

419
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:31,845
Well, both.
- Both?

420
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:35,652
Excuse me.

421
00:33:37,796 --> 00:33:42,290
Yes...? All right, I'll be there

422
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:46,132
Sorry, I've got to go. See you.

423
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:53,867
Nishi... do think about my offer

424
00:34:13,365 --> 00:34:15,697
Hi Shirley... how are you?
- I'm okay

425
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:18,231
Sorry, I had to call
you to a place like this

426
00:34:18,803 --> 00:34:21,897
That's okay. So...
what information is it?

427
00:34:23,441 --> 00:34:25,238
It's about Maharashtra Bottling

428
00:34:26,444 --> 00:34:28,639
Marwah has offered a
deal to Jhunjhunwala

429
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:34,251
Parvez gave me the documents
yesterday. I have the photo-copies

430
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:39,584
I hope nobody in your
office is suspicious about this?

431
00:34:40,258 --> 00:34:41,384
Not yet

432
00:34:43,762 --> 00:34:47,198
Thanks, Shelley. Here you are

433
00:34:54,873 --> 00:34:55,931
Hello. Navin...?

434
00:34:56,207 --> 00:34:57,333
So what's the deal?

435
00:34:57,842 --> 00:35:01,209
Marwah has offered you 3.3 billion.
- Yes

436
00:35:01,546 --> 00:35:02,740
For a complete buy-out.

437
00:35:03,882 --> 00:35:06,282
You also get
distribution rights for the South

438
00:35:06,418 --> 00:35:07,544
Yes

439
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:15,220
The Sehgal Group will give you
21 billion for a 51 per cent stake

440
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:20,422
And also Sri Lanka,
apart from South India

441
00:35:21,733 --> 00:35:23,564
Also the distribution
rights in the entire...

442
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:25,227
...North Eastern states will be yours

443
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:28,766
And this is not just
for the new products.

444
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:32,733
But for the entire
range of existing products.

445
00:35:34,846 --> 00:35:36,245
Ritesh...

446
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:41,644
The valuation of your company would
be in the range of 4 billion plus

447
00:35:42,987 --> 00:35:47,924
And the distribution will fetch an
additional 750 million ever year

448
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:51,261
Year after year after year.

449
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:58,867
Are you serious Ritesh? The
offer is too mouth-watering.

450
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,268
As I said, if we give you a
better deal than the Marwah's...

451
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,400
...You can congratulate us

452
00:36:10,815 --> 00:36:14,273
It's a deal.
- Thank you.

453
00:36:16,955 --> 00:36:19,890
I sent you to Jhunjhunwala to
find out what Marwah had offered him

454
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:22,551
And you went ahead and
made a commitment to him?

455
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:26,964
I made him an offer, he liked it...

456
00:36:27,031 --> 00:36:29,829
On what basis, Ritesh?
What made you do it?

457
00:36:30,702 --> 00:36:33,830
Did you discuss it with someone,
or seek anybody's permission?

458
00:36:33,972 --> 00:36:35,303
With me or the management?
- No

459
00:36:37,041 --> 00:36:39,032
I didn't consider it necessary.
- Ah!

460
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:44,037
How can you give him distribution
rights in our current products?

461
00:36:44,582 --> 00:36:47,312
What's the problem if
some new people are...

462
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:49,319
...brought into our
distribution system?

463
00:36:51,456 --> 00:36:52,923
So what happens of our
current distributors?

464
00:36:53,591 --> 00:36:56,389
They've been with us all these years,
even in our bad times...

465
00:36:56,528 --> 00:37:00,726
Doesn't that mean anything
to you? And you, Nishi...?

466
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:04,867
You know everything... at least
you could've made him see reason

467
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,401
No, I'm sorry.

468
00:37:07,605 --> 00:37:09,835
I cannot let this happen.
I won't approve this.

469
00:37:09,908 --> 00:37:11,341
That's it.

470
00:37:29,594 --> 00:37:31,357
So I will have to
take Navin Shroff's...

471
00:37:31,429 --> 00:37:33,021
...approval for every decision I make?

472
00:37:33,097 --> 00:37:34,758
Yes, you will have to, Ritesh

473
00:37:36,968 --> 00:37:39,630
You see, Navin has been
with me for eleven years

474
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,896
I trust his judgment
and decisions completely.

475
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:44,869
Navin has played a big
hand in getting the...

476
00:37:44,943 --> 00:37:46,376
...Sehgal Group where it is today

477
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:52,373
And then Ritesh, ultimately,
business is about teamwork, isn't it?

478
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:55,909
Excuse me.

479
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:01,050
Hey Steve. How are you man?

480
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:04,986
I'm good, I'm good.
- Yeah, yeah, we...

481
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:08,555
...we're working on the PSU deal, okay?

482
00:38:11,002 --> 00:38:14,403
Send the corrected
Jhunjhunwala deal to Mukesh. Yeah.

483
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:18,534
Okay fine.

484
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:50,439
Papa. He's been standing for a long
time... order something, will you?

485
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:53,836
What will I order, my child?
Have you seen the prices?

486
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:57,843
Look at this...
Cottage-cheese tikka: 375 rupees

487
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,516
We don't cottage-cheese
worth so much in a whole month!

488
00:39:01,586 --> 00:39:04,077
Seasoned lentil-curry: 345 rupees

489
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:07,958
Bread... 50 rupees!
And look at this...

490
00:39:08,026 --> 00:39:10,517
a large drink of whiskey...
495 rupees!

491
00:39:11,596 --> 00:39:14,656
The Udupi restaurant is any
day better! They serve nips...

492
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:18,463
we could've bought five nips!
- Papa... please!

493
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:22,730
Please place an order for
whatever you wish to eat!

494
00:39:23,608 --> 00:39:26,873
I'm footing the bill today.
- You ought to be happy...

495
00:39:26,978 --> 00:39:29,003
Megha has received her first salary...

496
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,480
and she has brought us
to this 5-star hotel

497
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:35,484
All right, I'll
place an order. Listen...

498
00:39:35,553 --> 00:39:38,078
big hotel, isn't it?
- Yes, sir

499
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:40,486
You must be getting a fat paycheck?
- Papa!

500
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:43,819
Have you bought an insurance policy?
- No, sir

501
00:39:44,629 --> 00:39:47,097
No...? But you must...
- You're making a pitch here, Papa!

502
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:48,496
One minute. I must
explain to him. Take this.

503
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:52,798
Give me a call and ask for
Arvind Apte. Who will you ask for?

504
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:55,700
Arvind Apte.
- There are Four Apte's in our office

505
00:39:55,907 --> 00:39:58,034
Ask only for Arvind Apte, okay?
- Very well, sir

506
00:39:58,576 --> 00:40:03,775
If he buys now, the premium will
be low and the span will be longer

507
00:40:03,915 --> 00:40:07,009
If he doesn't save now,
when is he going to save...?

508
00:40:07,118 --> 00:40:08,847
You have to guide these youngsters...
- Order...

509
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,512
...whatever you want to, Papa...

510
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:15,525
I'll be back in a moment.
- Sure... come here, you

511
00:40:15,727 --> 00:40:18,525
Today I'm going to order
something different. - Let's...

512
00:40:18,796 --> 00:40:21,128
...ask for...
- Nishi? - Hi. - Hi.

513
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,725
Hi Megha.

514
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:25,869
Who have you come with?
- Well, today's a Sunday...

515
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:28,531
...so, I've come with my parents.
- That's sweet

516
00:40:29,207 --> 00:40:33,007
Do you come here often?
- Not really.

517
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:35,876
Once you get involved in
the corporate lifestyle...

518
00:40:35,947 --> 00:40:38,541
you'll have no time for
the family. So that's good.

519
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:41,546
Make the most of your time.
- Thank you so much.

520
00:40:41,886 --> 00:40:43,547
Have a great life.

521
00:40:43,755 --> 00:40:44,881
See you in the office.
- Bye.

522
00:40:44,956 --> 00:40:46,548
Enjoy.

523
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:51,288
Nishi, this girl has the
same spark that you had.

524
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:52,957
What do you mean by 'had'?

525
00:40:54,766 --> 00:40:56,893
I mean... what you
had in the beginning

526
00:40:58,302 --> 00:41:00,236
I also think so. She'll do well

527
00:41:02,306 --> 00:41:05,764
Maybe we're small in the food
segment, but we have some big plans

528
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:07,103
By all means, Anand.

529
00:41:07,879 --> 00:41:11,315
This PSU is extremely critical
for our expansion plans, Vinay

530
00:41:12,583 --> 00:41:15,746
I have already turned down Marwah.
- Anand, I know that!

531
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,084
Vinay, you're a friend. I
came the moment you called me

532
00:41:20,324 --> 00:41:22,918
However, to cut a long story short...

533
00:41:22,994 --> 00:41:25,986
our company is not
backing off from making a bid

534
00:41:28,232 --> 00:41:30,132
That was a good game.
- Thank you.

535
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:31,600
I'll see you.
- Yeah.

536
00:41:37,608 --> 00:41:38,734
What happened, sir?

537
00:41:42,346 --> 00:41:45,747
Don't worry, sir. There's
surely going to be way out

538
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:53,351
A way out... on its own?
We'll have to find a way

539
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:56,758
Let's meet the stockbroker

540
00:42:05,169 --> 00:42:06,295
Now Mr... Sehgal...

541
00:42:07,371 --> 00:42:09,032
Ruia is an extremely difficult man

542
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:14,702
If he has refused you already...
it won't be easy to convince him

543
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:17,372
That's true.

544
00:42:19,383 --> 00:42:22,250
And that's exactly why I've
called in a star broker like you

545
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,985
Come to think of it,
he's the one who holds...

546
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:27,251
...the pulse of the stock-market

547
00:42:27,325 --> 00:42:34,663
Actually, we've worked on a deal. We
want you to study it thoroughly...

548
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:39,669
and bring Ruia around,
one way or the other

549
00:42:40,338 --> 00:42:42,806
Parekh, you crack
this thing with Ruia.

550
00:42:44,141 --> 00:42:46,405
I promise, I'll take
extremely good care of you

551
00:42:46,744 --> 00:42:50,680
Don't say that, sir.
You are embarrassing me

552
00:42:51,249 --> 00:42:55,083
In the last market-crash,
it was you who bailed me out

553
00:42:56,988 --> 00:43:01,322
Stop worrying about Ruia. I'll
do all I can to bring him around

554
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:04,351
That's my man.
- Hail Krishna.

555
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:05,888
You'll do it.

556
00:43:05,963 --> 00:43:09,421
I don't get you, Parikh.
- It's like this, Mr. Ruia

557
00:43:09,901 --> 00:43:12,335
Friscon's public
issue will be out soon

558
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,330
They have a market
capitalization of 60 billion

559
00:43:17,108 --> 00:43:19,372
The public issue isn't out yet...

560
00:43:19,443 --> 00:43:22,970
on what basis have you
worked out their market worth?

561
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:26,114
Mr... Ruia, we're
part of the stock market

562
00:43:26,918 --> 00:43:31,252
Institutions have bought the
shares at a premium of 110 rupees

563
00:43:32,123 --> 00:43:33,852
They'll obviously offer it to
the public at a higher price

564
00:43:34,725 --> 00:43:37,387
We've calculated their worth
with a price of 180 per share...

565
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:41,261
but the listing will certainly
be at a minimum of 300 rupees

566
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:45,227
Now imagine... if you
hold even 8 per cent...

567
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:47,396
...in such a giant corporation...

568
00:43:47,471 --> 00:43:50,463
what will be the
worth of your holding?

569
00:43:53,344 --> 00:43:56,142
Have you ever given it a thought?
- 4.8 billion

570
00:43:56,814 --> 00:44:03,811
Mr... Ruia, think of your own profits.
- Well, have a word with Sehgal then

571
00:44:04,221 --> 00:44:07,418
I'm okay with it.
- Hail Lord Krishna.

572
00:44:07,758 --> 00:44:08,952
Hail Lord Krishna.

573
00:44:10,494 --> 00:44:14,760
Yes, I'm with Nishi. I'll
come as soon as possible

574
00:44:15,032 --> 00:44:18,365
Okay, don't worry.
- Okay, bye.

575
00:44:22,173 --> 00:44:23,765
Why're you so upset?

576
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:26,968
Once it stops raining, you can leave

577
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:30,505
Wine.

578
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,521
Nishi... I have something to ask you

579
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:49,999
About me and Ritesh...
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

580
00:44:50,301 --> 00:44:53,464
Come off it, Megha. At
least you can ask me directly

581
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:55,466
Everybody at the office
gossips about us anyway

582
00:44:59,543 --> 00:45:04,810
I met Ritesh five years ago.
A year after my divorce

583
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:08,347
What? Were you married...?

584
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:13,881
In Calcutta. We were
divorced in just six months

585
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:22,829
After my divorce, I moved to Mumbai.
Depressed... and disillusioned

586
00:45:24,035 --> 00:45:25,229
I'm so sorry Nishi.

587
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:28,230
It's okay.

588
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:34,835
Call it hypocrisy. In
our society, there is...

589
00:45:34,912 --> 00:45:39,849
...no place for career-oriented girls

590
00:45:45,256 --> 00:45:47,247
I was on the verge of
a nervous breakdown.

591
00:45:51,595 --> 00:45:53,495
It was then that
Ritesh came into my life

592
00:45:56,467 --> 00:45:59,265
If it wasn't for him...

593
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:02,169
maybe I'd have been dead by now

594
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:09,938
Whatever I am today, whoever I am,
is all because of Ritesh

595
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:22,950
We plan to settle down
after the success of Friscon

596
00:46:24,995 --> 00:46:26,087
We'll be getting married

597
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,560
Congratulations.

598
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:33,901
What's happening, Parvez?

599
00:46:35,473 --> 00:46:37,304
It was Jhunjhunwala first.
Now it's Ruia

600
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:41,304
Go and see Gulabrao

601
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:46,078
I want MBC at any cost

602
00:46:47,585 --> 00:46:49,985
No matter what I stand to lose

603
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:54,082
I just can't figure
out what you're saying

604
00:46:56,093 --> 00:46:58,584
The Sehgal group has offered the
same deal that you are offering

605
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:03,263
Jhunjhunwala and Ruia
are both with them...

606
00:47:03,334 --> 00:47:06,929
they're mounting a lot of pressure.
- I have a request, sir

607
00:47:07,204 --> 00:47:10,571
Before you take a decision,
please talk to Mr. Marwah once

608
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:14,567
That's no good...
Mhatre, he doesn't understand

609
00:47:16,947 --> 00:47:18,141
Sir...

610
00:47:18,215 --> 00:47:19,682
...please talk to Mr. Gulabrao

611
00:47:20,284 --> 00:47:21,410
Who is it?
- Mr. Marwah

612
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:26,347
Hello

613
00:47:26,423 --> 00:47:28,687
Greetings, Mr.
Gulabrao... how are you?

614
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:30,960
I'll be just as you wish me to be

615
00:47:31,695 --> 00:47:33,686
What should we be
doing for the MBC deal?

616
00:47:34,698 --> 00:47:36,689
That's a serious problem

617
00:47:38,269 --> 00:47:41,170
Sehgal is offering the same deal
that you're offering... 5 per cent

618
00:47:41,705 --> 00:47:45,971
What d'you think of 8 per cent?
The PSU is worth 10 billion

619
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,270
It would work out to 800 million

620
00:47:50,714 --> 00:47:53,649
Half of it
- 400 million. In advance

621
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:57,520
lt'll be deposited in your
account in any bank you say

622
00:48:00,724 --> 00:48:05,388
What if I still give the PSU to
Sehgal, despite everything...?

623
00:48:05,663 --> 00:48:07,995
Then keep what I give
you as a gift from a friend

624
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:11,194
Bapu has blessed me with enough.
There'll be more coming

625
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:15,002
Looks like it's going to
be fun working with you

626
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,402
Of course it'll be fun.
Please at least make a beginning

627
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:22,506
All right, I'll work out something

628
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:25,078
Good bye

629
00:48:28,652 --> 00:48:30,677
So how do we go about it, sir?

630
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:38,218
What will I say...? It
could turn positive, you know

631
00:48:39,029 --> 00:48:41,020
Hey Mhatre.
- Yes sir.

632
00:48:41,098 --> 00:48:44,226
See what he says about the cash.

633
00:48:44,301 --> 00:48:46,030
Okay sir.

634
00:48:47,705 --> 00:48:49,036
Very well then...
- Thank you, sir

635
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,238
What do you think...? You
think it's going to work?

636
00:49:00,718 --> 00:49:02,117
Oh yes, it should

637
00:49:03,187 --> 00:49:07,351
Do you have any
connections in the film world?

638
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:11,058
What?

639
00:49:38,322 --> 00:49:42,816
Why must you yearn thus...?
Things will soon change

640
00:49:43,193 --> 00:49:47,596
If only you could
look within... for once

641
00:49:50,301 --> 00:49:54,499
There's something about you surely.
It's your stature, I admit

642
00:49:54,838 --> 00:49:58,774
There's something about you surely.
It's your stature, I admit

643
00:49:59,576 --> 00:50:03,103
You have it in you to
become the conqueror of all

644
00:50:04,315 --> 00:50:07,307
You have it in you to
become the conqueror of all

645
00:50:08,852 --> 00:50:12,652
O conqueror...

646
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:17,117
if only you would look within

647
00:50:18,195 --> 00:50:22,131
O conqueror...

648
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,634
if only you would look within

649
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:40,680
Make the attempt and
hardships shall cease to be

650
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:45,418
It takes a rendezvous to
sate the desires of the heart

651
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:51,150
Whatever you find, is
part of your destiny...

652
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:55,688
Whatever you find, is
part of your destiny...

653
00:50:55,899 --> 00:51:00,359
what you do not achieve,
you are not destined to

654
00:51:00,838 --> 00:51:04,774
what you do not achieve,
you are not destined to

655
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:09,336
O conqueror...

656
00:51:09,913 --> 00:51:13,576
Iook within

657
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:19,247
Why must you yearn thus...?
Things will soon change

658
00:51:19,723 --> 00:51:24,183
If only you could
look within... for once

659
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,723
There's something about you surely.
It's your stature, I admit

660
00:51:31,335 --> 00:51:35,465
There's something about you surely.
It's your stature, I admit

661
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:39,536
You have it in you to
become the conqueror of all

662
00:51:40,677 --> 00:51:43,737
You have it in you to
become the conqueror of all

663
00:51:45,282 --> 00:51:48,740
O conqueror...

664
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:53,618
if only you would look within

665
00:51:54,758 --> 00:51:58,216
O conqueror...

666
00:51:59,430 --> 00:52:02,888
O conqueror...

667
00:52:04,435 --> 00:52:06,528
Vow! This is very nice.

668
00:52:06,603 --> 00:52:08,730
It's too good.

669
00:52:09,306 --> 00:52:13,640
Not to worry.
Everything will be organised

670
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:15,242
Come with me. Come on.

671
00:52:20,684 --> 00:52:23,551
Hello, Sajid-ji... I'm Ashok
Pandit from the Dainik Vichaar daily

672
00:52:24,855 --> 00:52:26,254
Please be seated

673
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:31,326
You've included an item-song
even in this film of yours?

674
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:36,565
This is not a hot number, okay...?

675
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:41,265
This is a philosophical Sufi song.
- Oh, I see

676
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:45,007
When's the book you're
writing going to be published?

677
00:52:45,476 --> 00:52:49,674
My Breath will arrive first.
And then... the book

678
00:52:49,746 --> 00:52:52,806
Breath?
- That's the name of my film

679
00:52:52,883 --> 00:52:55,408
Oh, I'm sorry, sorry. Sorry sir.

680
00:52:55,953 --> 00:53:00,287
Please do your homework well
before you come to me... disgusting

681
00:53:00,491 --> 00:53:05,292
These so-called journalists! Payal...

682
00:53:05,562 --> 00:53:07,496
I can't see Sikander.

683
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:10,289
I want to see Sikander on this face.
- Okay baby.

684
00:53:10,434 --> 00:53:13,892
More of Sikander on your face.

685
00:53:14,705 --> 00:53:15,831
Right.

686
00:53:18,942 --> 00:53:20,307
Are you through?

687
00:53:20,377 --> 00:53:22,709
Who are they, Ballu?
- Some corporate guys

688
00:53:22,913 --> 00:53:25,507
And who do I have to go to?
- A politician

689
00:53:25,816 --> 00:53:28,307
Delhi, or Bombay?
- Local

690
00:53:28,652 --> 00:53:31,314
Indoor, or outdoor?
- Indoor. In Mumbai

691
00:53:31,655 --> 00:53:33,520
When?
- The day after tomorrow

692
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:37,783
How much am I getting?
- I've quoted 400,000

693
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,463
Ballu, how often have I told you?

694
00:53:40,531 --> 00:53:42,328
I'm not accepting a
penny less than five

695
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:44,327
You get a cut of 10
per cent, don't you?

696
00:53:46,837 --> 00:53:48,532
And what happened of my brother's gym?

697
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:51,334
Don't you know? He needs permission
to build a two-storied structure

698
00:53:51,408 --> 00:53:53,535
When are you doing that?
- I've discussed everything

699
00:53:53,677 --> 00:53:55,804
The matter is being processed.
You needn't worry

700
00:53:57,681 --> 00:54:00,343
Okay, I'll be there the
day after tomorrow... go on

701
00:54:01,852 --> 00:54:03,547
I'm at a charity function

702
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:06,349
Assembly's in session

703
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:08,550
Your work will get done
only after the session

704
00:54:12,429 --> 00:54:14,363
Do not disturb.
- Very well, sir

705
00:54:19,436 --> 00:54:23,702
Oh Sikander, Sikander, Oh Sikander...

706
00:54:23,907 --> 00:54:28,367
Look into my heart...

707
00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:32,910
Oh Sikander, Sikander, Oh Sikander...

708
00:54:35,986 --> 00:54:40,389
Kumar, the girl goes into that room.
The minister went into that one...

709
00:54:40,457 --> 00:54:43,858
and you said it was all set-up?
- Namya...

710
00:54:44,561 --> 00:54:46,654
you've just arrived
from backward of beyond

711
00:54:47,464 --> 00:54:51,400
This is a 5-star hotel.
They have certain specialties

712
00:54:51,802 --> 00:54:57,399
There's a door between the two rooms.
As soon as it opens... bingo!

713
00:54:57,474 --> 00:54:59,408
Don't tell me!
- It's the usual stuff

714
00:55:16,493 --> 00:55:18,427
Hello, Payal-ji.
- Hello

715
00:55:18,762 --> 00:55:20,957
Please be seated... sit down

716
00:55:27,504 --> 00:55:30,564
I must say... I'm a
great fan of yours, Payal-ji

717
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:37,444
I don't watch too many films,
but the movies in which...

718
00:55:37,514 --> 00:55:40,449
you dance or perform
a special number...

719
00:55:40,517 --> 00:55:44,453
...l've seen those
parts several times...

720
00:55:44,521 --> 00:55:46,455
so very often on DVDs

721
00:55:47,958 --> 00:55:51,951
Take it from me... the movies of
the big stars that are successful...

722
00:55:52,029 --> 00:55:55,658
they're doing well only
because of your special dance numbers

723
00:55:57,534 --> 00:55:58,592
What a dancer you are!

724
00:55:58,669 --> 00:56:01,137
I must say Ms. Payal. You're rocking!

725
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:04,000
Shall we get on with it...?

726
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:08,801
I've got to inaugurate
a boutique after this

727
00:56:08,879 --> 00:56:12,474
Oh, certainly... c'mon

728
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:26,758
Namya, you got the pack of cards?
- No. Why?

729
00:56:27,097 --> 00:56:29,031
We have an hour or so to kill.

730
00:56:29,566 --> 00:56:31,898
We could've at least
played a game of cards

731
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:45,174
Wait for another 15 or
20 minutes, will you?

732
00:56:46,016 --> 00:56:49,508
Yes... everybody will get to
know in just 15 or 20 minutes

733
00:56:51,588 --> 00:56:53,522
Me first, me first...

734
00:56:53,857 --> 00:56:56,655
these guys from the media! Everybody
wants to break the news first

735
00:56:57,594 --> 00:57:00,654
Mhatre, what's the
position like on the MBC bids?

736
00:57:01,031 --> 00:57:02,794
Have you opened all the bids?
- Yes, sir

737
00:57:05,869 --> 00:57:09,930
Madam Prabhune... Satam...
please wait outside for a while

738
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,598
I'll send for you

739
00:57:19,616 --> 00:57:21,550
Mhatre, whose is the highest bid?

740
00:57:21,618 --> 00:57:24,018
The Sehgal Group, sir.
10 billion and 2.5 million

741
00:57:25,889 --> 00:57:27,083
How about Anand Ruia?

742
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:28,954
SRM Foods have bid 9.6 billion

743
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:34,096
Now... you have the blank
bid of the Marwah's, don't you?

744
00:57:34,164 --> 00:57:37,964
Yes, I do, sir.
- Raise it by 50 million...

745
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:39,968
Make it 10 billion, 300 million?
- Yes, 10 billion, 300 million

746
00:57:40,637 --> 00:57:42,901
Okay, sir.
- Hurry up... put it all back inside

747
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:47,098
Put big seals on the envelopes...
I don't want any trouble later

748
00:57:48,745 --> 00:57:52,181
And in about 20 minutes... make
the announcement. Breaking news

749
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:54,573
We're on to some more business news.

750
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:57,586
The bids for Maharashtra
Bottling and Confectionary Ltd...

751
00:57:57,654 --> 00:58:00,589
...one of the seven PSUs that were
on the block for...

752
00:58:00,657 --> 00:58:02,591
...disinvestment were opened today.

753
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:06,593
Sehgal Group of Industries, which was
always the frontrunner in these bids...

754
00:58:06,663 --> 00:58:10,793
...was today piped by traditional
rivals, the Marwah Group of Industries.

755
00:58:11,668 --> 00:58:14,603
Our correspondent Parag Goyal is
presently outside Mantralaya...

756
00:58:14,671 --> 00:58:17,606
...with Pervez Merchant,
the CEO of Marwah Group.

757
00:58:21,111 --> 00:58:24,603
Gulabrao gave us the re-assurance...
that it would go our way

758
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:29,281
Even the price we quoted
was what was suggested by him

759
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:35,683
I mean... I can't figure
how he... I don't know

760
00:59:04,988 --> 00:59:06,649
Make me a drink will you?

761
00:59:14,164 --> 00:59:17,656
Bapu... with your blessings,
all is well

762
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:22,661
With your blessings, our
company has even acquired a PSU

763
00:59:23,006 --> 00:59:26,806
I had told you... you
have a bright future

764
00:59:29,012 --> 00:59:31,674
Praise the Lord...

765
00:59:33,183 --> 00:59:35,811
Jalpa... my son-in-law, too.
- Come, my child

766
00:59:37,187 --> 00:59:39,087
May you bear a son. May you live long

767
00:59:41,024 --> 00:59:42,685
He has given her his blessings

768
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:46,217
Bapu, if you would care to eat...
- Praise the Lord

769
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:15,849
What made you call me so urgently?
- There's some vital information

770
01:00:18,228 --> 01:00:21,720
Marwah had spread the
impression that he would be packaging...

771
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:24,198
mineral water at the
Maharashtra Bottling

772
01:00:24,801 --> 01:00:27,736
So what's new?
- Actually they plan to manufacture...

773
01:00:27,804 --> 01:00:30,204
a mint-based soft-drink there

774
01:00:35,245 --> 01:00:37,236
How do you know it's a
mint-based soft drink?

775
01:00:37,814 --> 01:00:42,751
The company has imported the plant
and the machinery for this purpose

776
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,879
Here are some important
emails that were exchanged

777
01:00:48,258 --> 01:00:51,887
Could you get details...?
Marketing plans and so on?

778
01:00:51,962 --> 01:00:55,022
Impossible. That's in the
possession of only the company heads

779
01:00:56,833 --> 01:00:58,767
Pervez is heading the project.

780
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:01,770
What are Pervez's plans
for the next few weeks?

781
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:05,768
He's going to Delhi tomorrow.
Important branch-office meetings

782
01:01:32,202 --> 01:01:33,794
We have to call a
meeting as soon as possible...

783
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:35,804
...so you inform all branch offices.

784
01:01:35,872 --> 01:01:36,930
You know everybody there?
- Yes, sir

785
01:01:37,007 --> 01:01:38,065
- They've already prepared

786
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:41,800
But I still want you to
call everybody over here...

787
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:45,075
because I don't want us
to get late. I think...

788
01:01:45,148 --> 01:01:46,809
That also reminds me Manji that...

789
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:49,943
I get it, yes.

790
01:01:54,891 --> 01:01:56,290
Well, I'll talk to you later.

791
01:01:56,893 --> 01:01:57,951
Those in Chandigarh... call them over

792
01:01:58,028 --> 01:02:01,828
Mail the details to me
at once. Yes... okay

793
01:02:02,332 --> 01:02:05,028
Hey Nishi.
- I'll just call you back. Bye, okay.

794
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:08,837
How come you're in Delhi?
- We had a branch-office meeting

795
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:11,169
Same here. We had a
meeting too. What a coincidence!

796
01:02:11,241 --> 01:02:12,833
That is a strange coincidence.

797
01:02:12,909 --> 01:02:14,843
Same city, same hotel.

798
01:02:15,178 --> 01:02:17,043
You're having dinner with me tonight

799
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:19,848
Parvez, there you go again

800
01:02:20,183 --> 01:02:22,310
I'm having dinner with
some friends this evening

801
01:02:22,919 --> 01:02:26,980
Okay, if not dinner, we'll have a
drink together. You owe me one, okay?

802
01:02:27,924 --> 01:02:29,983
You always make excuses
in Mumbai. So... please?

803
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:32,855
All right, if you insist.

804
01:02:33,363 --> 01:02:35,854
What time?
- Nine O'clock sharp. Okay.

805
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:39,066
Bye.
- Bye.

806
01:02:47,944 --> 01:02:51,209
That was a good one. Pervez,
you are a really funny guy.

807
01:02:51,948 --> 01:02:54,883
I hope in the right sense. Absolutely.

808
01:02:55,952 --> 01:03:02,881
Having spent time with you today,
I feel you're a gamely person...

809
01:03:02,959 --> 01:03:04,893
A very nice guy. I
totally misunderstood you.

810
01:03:04,961 --> 01:03:08,226
Maybe because we're competitors

811
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:14,562
I wasn't very nice to you
whenever I met you earlier

812
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:18,397
To the point of being rude sometimes.

813
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:24,504
I apologize. I'm really very sorry.

814
01:03:32,255 --> 01:03:33,916
Nishi, why don't you join us?

815
01:03:36,426 --> 01:03:38,917
Okay, tell me. What's your offer?

816
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:44,456
Double the salary and perks;
stock options and above all...

817
01:03:45,001 --> 01:03:48,459
...a Senior Vice-President's position.

818
01:03:49,439 --> 01:03:54,934
You'll be reporting directly to me.
Virtually, CEO's designation.

819
01:03:55,278 --> 01:04:00,079
Vow! - How's the offer? - It
sounds too good to be true.

820
01:04:02,018 --> 01:04:05,954
But may I ask... why make
such a lucrative offer to me?

821
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,959
Well, best deserves the best.

822
01:04:11,027 --> 01:04:14,963
Thanks Pervez. That's very
flattering. Excuse me. - Sure.

823
01:04:20,036 --> 01:04:23,164
Yes, Pammi... I'll be there.
In 15 minutes.

824
01:04:26,042 --> 01:04:28,101
Sorry, I have to go.

825
01:04:31,314 --> 01:04:34,511
Nishi, can't you really
avoid your friends? Please...

826
01:04:36,052 --> 01:04:37,383
Just see, we are
having a good time in Delhi.

827
01:04:37,453 --> 01:04:42,254
...let's go and hit the disc after this.
- I know, Parvez... but not today

828
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:46,121
Any other day in Mumbai.
Just you, for sure.

829
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:48,991
Promise?
- Yeah, promise. See you.

830
01:04:52,602 --> 01:04:54,467
It was a lovely evening.

831
01:05:00,076 --> 01:05:01,202
Don't drink too much. Bye.

832
01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:14,420
One more drink please.
- Yes sir.

833
01:05:22,532 --> 01:05:29,028
My youth is drying up...

834
01:05:29,172 --> 01:05:32,039
My lover doesn't give me any water...

835
01:05:32,108 --> 01:05:36,044
One scotch with lots
of ice. - Right sir.

836
01:05:36,379 --> 01:05:43,046
The month of summer
increasing the indifference...

837
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:47,055
My heart is burning...

838
01:05:47,123 --> 01:05:49,057
I will drown in the well,
I will drown in the well...

839
01:05:49,125 --> 01:05:51,389
One Margarita. - Right away ma'am.

840
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:54,055
I will drown in the well, I
will drown in the well...

841
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,533
I will drown in the well, I will
drown in the well... - Hi. - Hi.

842
01:06:02,238 --> 01:06:04,468
Are you alone?
- What?

843
01:06:05,141 --> 01:06:07,075
How about having a drink with me?

844
01:06:08,144 --> 01:06:09,611
This place is too noisy.

845
01:06:13,149 --> 01:06:16,084
How about going someplace else?
- Like where?

846
01:06:18,087 --> 01:06:19,145
My room.

847
01:06:27,597 --> 01:06:30,430
But that'll cost you.
- Really?

848
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:32,427
How much?

849
01:06:37,707 --> 01:06:40,608
35.
- No it's too much.

850
01:06:42,612 --> 01:06:45,445
25.
- 30. - Okay done. - Okay.

851
01:06:58,194 --> 01:07:00,128
Should we leave?
- No not now.

852
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:05,465
I'll go first. You'll follow me. Okay?

853
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:13,601
Room number 2019.
- See you.

854
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:16,342
I am scared and not
opening my door...
