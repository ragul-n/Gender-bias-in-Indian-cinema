Arun, I need to talk to you. Tell me.

14
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:24,500
Come sit. Listen in some days you'll become top most play back-singer.

15
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,458
And you're good looking too; maybe you'll become a film hero too.

16
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,625
Really! But remember this is show business, so here

17
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:37,750
you need to keep up with appearances. Do you still live in that dirty Ram-Bharose Hotel?

18
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,458
Yes, I do. If you want to progress, try and live in better place.

19
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:47,291
I am sorry; I don't that kind of progress. Since college days, we five friends

20
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:52,416
have lived there. We made a pact that till we become independent, we'll

21
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:58,291
live together. Our motto is, One for five and five for one. One of our

22
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:04,458
friends, Pandey he is married, but to keep up his promise, he left his wife

23
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:09,458
in village and live here with us. Do you know, what people call five of us

24
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:14,750
Five Pandavs, they've been living in top rooms like TB bacteria in lungs.

25
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,500
Five Pandavs, they've been living in top rooms like TB bacteria in lungs.

26
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,458
When we try to send them away, they threaten us with our lives. We try

27
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:26,916
to increase the rent, they threaten us with law.

28
00:05:27,416 --> 00:05:32,500
Do something Ram Bharose, I'll give 2-3 times more rent. If you like I can

29
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,458
give deposit too.

30
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:40,291
Shhsss. Not so loud, say it in my ear. How much deposit you'd pay, 2000?

31
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:46,000
I am ready. No, no. 3000. That 2000 just came out.

32
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,166
Think again, you're sure about it?

33
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:54,458
No No No this 3000 is absolutely correct. Plus 200-300 for paper work and

34
00:05:54,958 --> 00:05:59,375
lawyer, and I will make sure that I throw those five Pandavs out of here.

35
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:05,583
I've ordered my servants, not to put sugar in their tea, neither salt in their

36
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:11,625
food. Look, Arjun is coming. Namaste, Ram Bharose Ji. Namaste.

00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:54,458
Hey suresh, don't open it, please don't. Close it, close the window.

43
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:58,125
I've told you many times, moment I see women, I start to hiccup.

Why, what happened? Why you all are silent? Aren't you going to ask me about my job?

85
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,583
Let me tell you, I didn't get the job, neither I will ever get one.

86
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:16,583
So, why the long face? We all are not dead yet.

87
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:23,458
Listen Kishan, we are five for one and one for five. Yes, one for five and five for one.

88
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:31,041
And don't forget you silly man, when you share happiness it increases and sorrow decreases.

89
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:37,041
So what the problem? No smile, you donkey. Smile, laugh Kishan.

90
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:40,250
How am I suppose to smile? How long will I rely on you all?

91
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,875
How long would I take favours from friends?

92
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,458
Oh man kishan, this is too much, really too much. What favour?

93
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:49,458
What happened to friendship and love? There is no favour in friendship,

94
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:59,333
there is just love, there is no money, nor favour no nothing like that, and friendship is friendship..

95
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:07,875
There are not issues of favours When it's a friendship, it's a friendship

96
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:22,875
And there are not favours in friends When it's a friendship, it's a friendship

97
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:26,875
And there are not favours in friends

98
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,000
Without water fish can't survive Like without water tab gets restless

99
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,250
Without water fish can't survive Like without water tab gets restless

100
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,875
Without water fish can't survive Like without water tab gets restless

101
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,958
Without clear water We cannot bath

102
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:11,416
When it's a friendship, it's a friendship And there are not favours in friends

103
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,625
This jury who think all will be correct We are five sons of this country

104
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:17,458
What we said will happen This jury who thinks all will be correct

105
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,958
We are five sons of this country What we will say will happen

106
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:30,833
Will kick you hard If milk will be curd

107
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:36,750
Then milk will be curd Meera's Lord said to Kabir

108
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:44,500
Life is name of deeds and fortune

109
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,958
Meera's Lord said to Kabir Life is name of deeds and fortune

110
00:13:51,458 --> 00:14:03,125
And without hard work life is not easy When it's a friendship, it's a friendship

111
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:07,125
And there are not favours in friends When it's a friendship, it's a friendship

112
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:35,416
When it's a friendship, it's a friendship

113
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,416
And there are not favours in friends

114
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:03,583
Madhav Yes

115
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:09,416
Which one is top floor switch? This one Turn if off

116
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:13,541
What happened? Looks like it fused. This is strange.

117
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:18,250
Manager's light is on, ours is off. I am sure he is again mucking around.

118
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,625
First sugarless tea, and now room without light. lets go, I will kill him.

119
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:24,458
Would I get the same prison time for Killing a manager,

120
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,500
as compared to killing a common man.

121
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,458
No, I think they will give you bravery award. Let's go. Lets go.

122
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,458
Sir, they are coming. Okay.

123
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:52,416
Look at this; he got the light on, but our fuse it off. Right

124
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:56,041
It is not fused my Yudhishtar, I've turned it off.

125
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:01,458
Why Oh Arjun, don't be so ready to fight.

126
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:07,500
I switched off the light because staying up all night will affect you heath.

127
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,541
It is my health, not yours, why you so worried.

128
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,458
What you saying, it will ruin my hotels reputation.

129
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,041
You're intentionally trying to harass us, so that we leave this place,

130
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:24,041
why did you stop sugar in tea? Too much sugar can cause diabetes.

131
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:26,500
You're an idiot, thief and a horrible man.

132
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,958
I am like your brother, Nakul, a younger brother.

133
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:33,458
And you Sahdev, come on say something.

134
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,500
You're a crook, a thief, you rob people with both hands.

135
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,166
My mistake, but this time it is just one hand.

136
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,916
So let me also do something with one hand. Wait, what you think you're doing.

137
00:16:44,416 --> 00:16:47,708
I am not doing anything, just trying to look after your health, you should also take rest,

138
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:55,250
and after all it is the matter of hospitals reputation. Your eyes are popping as it is.

139
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:02,916
Lets go brothers, I don't trust this animal in darkness. Lets go everyone.

140
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:08,000
Oh so it is like that! I swear I will get rid of you in 3-4 days,

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:11,375
he was trying to say if he finds a girl, he looks at them with brotherly love.

153
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:14,125
I won't be fooled with this. So what do you want?

154
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,458
I will search the room. Hold it, I will kill you all.

155
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:22,458
Listen Suresh, if we didn't bring any girls, why should we be scared?

156
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,458
Okay everyone search the room. Okay. Search everywhere. Yeah.

157
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:34,458
And you listen manager, if you didn't find any girls, I will personally bite you like a dog.

158
00:18:34,958 --> 00:18:42,000
There is no one here manager. Look, look, if you like look under the bed.

Okay girl, you go out.

163
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:02,375

164
00:19:02,875 --> 00:19:05,458

00:34:59,458 --> 00:35:06,458
I tricked Ram Bharose finally, now those new shoes, bangle, sari and hair

315
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:09,583
are free of cost. Come on shake hands. No no What no

316
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:12,750
Lady, I will take part in it. Even I won't do it.

317
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:15,458
If people came to know then we will all go to jail.

318
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:19,375
This is nice; first you gave big talks about friendship. We'll do everything for friendship. Now

319
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:24,916
you're scared of going to prison.

320
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,875
It is not just that, let me explain. Stop it, first listen to me.

321
00:35:29,375 --> 00:35:31,541
Mishra ji is an old man, plus he has blood

322
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:36,458
pressure, he lives on first floor, doesn't move at all and his wife, she is

323
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:42,625
blind. She can't make a buffalo in front of her. Then what are we scared

324
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:49,041
of? Didn't you notice, even Ram Bharose thought we were girls. Listen Kishan, it is for few

325
00:35:49,541 --> 00:35:54,208
days, and then we will find a new house and move there.

326
00:35:54,708 --> 00:35:57,291
Pandey, this is all good but I don't want to cheat a decent man.

327
00:35:57,791 --> 00:36:01,458
Cheat, we are not cheating, we not decent people or not? What are you

328
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:05,625
talking about? They want a married couple so that there is no hassle in the house. We

329
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:10,458
wont create any hassle, that is all! But living like a girl is not right.

330
00:36:10,958 --> 00:36:16,458
Listen, I know one thing that my heart is clean and rest is up-to you guys. We have to

331
00:36:16,958 --> 00:36:20,541
vacate this place in 2-3 hours. Shekhar will move in with his

332
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:28,458
aunty. Arun and Suresh will move in with some friends. This poor man will live on

333
00:36:28,958 --> 00:36:32,791
footpath and I will quit my job in days and move back to village

334
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:39,375
and do farming. What will happen to our pact? That one for five and five for one? Once

335
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:43,375
the pact is broken, we will never meet each other for rest of

336
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:55,833
our lives. Please just for tonight turn into girls and next morning we will tell Mishra ji

337
00:36:56,333 --> 00:37:00,541
that both the wives have gone home. Even now if you don't

338
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:09,666
agree then I will think I have been a fool to leave my wife in village for friendsnow I really

339
00:37:10,166 --> 00:37:17,333
don't want to say anything. Lets pack and move on.

340
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:45,458

Truth and false are old friends They live in two eyes

348

They see world turn by turn By blinking eye they say so

349
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,458
Sins, well deeds and repent are beads of one ornament

350
00:39:04,958 --> 00:39:09,208
Beads of one ornament By saying false you nailed it

351

Someone will get tied by garland (that Indian women wear on head)

They will hear and agree to what we had said They will hear and agree to what we had said

With two beautiful eyes My heart and life is presented to you

478
00:57:06,833 --> 00:57:12,500
Someone should be able to hold heart and life

479
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:16,500
By hesitating lips When someone conveys greetings Hesitating lips

480

What nonsense you're talking about? Why don't you admit, you don't want to take me to

520
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,458

Aunty told me to be ready and keep my hair open. I don't know what she is planning.

529
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:40,041
Listen, keep an eye on the girls. Aunty

01:08:16,833 --> 01:08:20,333
Even I think the same. Come on. Oh oh easy easy, what happened sister in law?

541
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:51,291

01:09:51,791 --> 01:09:53,375
Here, hold this Where is your wife?

543
01:09:53,875 --> 01:09:56,791
She did not come with me. This month is not auspicious. She will come after 17 days. Hey,

544
01:09:57,291 --> 01:10:05,458
where is Arun? There is singing program in Nirmala College. He will get 500 bucks for it;

545
01:10:05,958 --> 01:10:10,750
he is gone there to talk. What the heck? How could he leave like that? This is dangerous.

546
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:17,041
That is nothing, something worse happened with me. My father wrote me a letter, he is coming here.

547
01:10:17,541 --> 01:10:21,750
Damn, we are screwed. Now you listen to me, tell your dad

548
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:26,791
not to come here otherwise our little scheme will fail and we will go to prison. Just

549
01:10:27,291 --> 01:10:32,500
write him back. I can't do it, I didn't reply to his earlier letters. What if he came

550
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,083
here before my letter?

551
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:39,916
What do you mean? He just can't come here. If he found out, we all are married here

552
01:10:40,416 --> 01:10:44,208
than he will beat us black and blue. I don't care what you

553
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:48,208
have to do, just stop him from coming here otherwise he will be in trouble.

554
01:10:56,083 --> 01:11:01,833
It is late in night, Arun hasn't come back home yet. I think

555
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:13,875

557
01:11:18,166 --> 01:11:21,458
But Aunty tied the thread to elder one then how come younger one got sick?

558
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:32,291
I don't know, Listen, what is the hurry? First talk to brother and then his wife, oye Suresh move away.

559
01:11:32,791 --> 01:11:37,458
Yes Wife, please move to other side. Come, sit with us and

560
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:40,500
later you can talk to younger one.

561
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,083
Pandey brother, the thing is my college is hosting a charity show to raise defence fund and

Pandey brother, this Arun Kumar sings too? Yes. I think he can sing.

575
01:12:53,958 --> 01:12:58,000
Then you would have to buy the tickets as he is singing in the show.

576
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:05,291
God damn. I mean Arun sings alright, but do you what kind of singing? No SingNo

579
01:13:19,750 --> 01:13:23,708
Okay, tell me one thing, this stage program, is it black and out or coloured?

580
01:13:24,208 --> 01:13:29,458
This is not a movie. Okay, so on stage there is no colour or black and white.

581
01:13:29,958 --> 01:13:37,416
On stage, a man looks like as it is. Well I don't watch much movie or stage, so I don't know.

582
01:13:37,916 --> 01:13:43,833
How are you Geeta. Sister in law, how are you? I heard you're having tummy issues.

583
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:47,833
Yeah, today it is bad. Okay, you take some rest, I will see you tomorrow. Okay. Okay everyone

584
01:13:58,750 --> 01:14:03,458
Listen Arun, you're program of singing is in her college. What Yes

01:14:03,958 --> 01:14:10,416
I am dead. I mean, literally dead. Now what are you going to do? Tell me

586
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:15,458
What do you mean, what I will do? Say no, damn with 500 rupees. What

587
01:14:15,958 --> 01:14:19,500
Arun Kumar is not coming. Yes, he is not coming, he said no.

588
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,791
Now what is going to happen? We have sold all the tickets and there is

589
01:14:23,291 --> 01:14:26,666
a house-full board outside Now we have to put April fool board.

590
01:14:27,166 --> 01:14:30,291
Oh my god, people are going to kill us. If my husband was here,

591
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:34,875
he sure would have found a way. Leela, you're a strong girl,

592
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:39,375
can you go on stage and tell people that Arun Kumar won't be coming.

593
01:14:39,875 --> 01:14:46,625
But what reason would I give? Anything. Just tell them that Arun kumar is dead.

594
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:50,166
What are you saying? People nowadays would like to see dead body too.

595
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:54,666
Yes, people who paid would want dead body to sing.

596
01:14:55,166 --> 01:14:58,500
We were doing this program for nation's security, but now look like we need

597
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,125
to find security for ourselves. If my husband was here

598
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:05,541
To hell with you and your husband We have seen slave husbands,

599
01:15:06,041 --> 01:15:08,958
but we have never seen slave husbands wife, till nowl mean

600
01:15:09,458 --> 01:15:12,125
Quite everyone. Arun Kumar will sing. What

601
01:15:12,625 --> 01:15:15,333
Yes, I know a different Arun Kumar. But people

602
01:15:15,833 --> 01:15:21,291
Shut up, let me complete. We will get that Arun Kumar, make him stand in darkness,

603
01:15:21,791 --> 01:15:25,083
people wont find out Can this Arun Kumar Sing?

604
01:15:25,583 --> 01:15:30,458
Maybe not because he is beautiful Being Beautiful and able to sing,

605
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:33,916
can only happen in movies But how all this will happen.

606
01:15:34,416 --> 01:15:39,708
We will play real Arun Kumar's tape. But what will happen by taping him?

607
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:46,291
Not tape him, idiot play his music record, we will play real Arun Kumar's record

608
01:15:46,791 --> 01:15:53,375
and fake Arun Kumar will just lip sync. Oh geeta, you're a genius.

609
01:15:53,875 --> 01:15:56,500
Had Meena's husband been here, he would have married you.

610
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,791
Oyyeee So this Fake Arun Kumar will agree to all this.

611
01:16:00,291 --> 01:16:03,625
How can he notyou have to sing, you have to help us.

612
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:06,833
What, you want me to sing? It's like telling a cripple to dance,

613
01:16:07,333 --> 01:16:10,583
I don't like singing. My blood will be on your hands.

614
01:16:11,083 --> 01:16:15,750
Oh please no, I can stand blood, trust me, I can't even watch my own blood.

615
01:16:16,250 --> 01:16:19,333
Please don't joke; so many girls' reputation is in your hands.

616
01:16:19,833 --> 01:16:25,583

01:38:30,875 --> 01:38:37,750
my wife is not exactly my wife. I wish you knew, how big a lie the entire thing is.

817
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,333
but getting married in front of fire is not a lie.

818
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:46,541
Who got married infront of fire? That is not a wife

819
01:38:47,041 --> 01:38:50,541

Why do you think he comes here every day? I think he come here to meet you

823
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:13,708

Really, I am happily married, why would I want to die

859
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:58,583
Little one, if you don't die, this Shekhar will never find success in his love life. Really

860
01:41:59,083 --> 01:42:06,458
And till you're alive, this shameless traitor who is screaming will die painfully

Shekhar is free to romance, and you can marry Geeta, both of you will have clean shots.
