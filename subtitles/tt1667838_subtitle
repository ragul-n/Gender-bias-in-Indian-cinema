raj was so perfect that everybody
loved him

14
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,629
my mother was gujrati and dad
was punjabi

15
00:03:56,135 --> 00:04:00,834
after her experience my mom has
decided her son in law will be gujrati

16
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,249
my mom had only one dream

17
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,050
one day my wedding card will be here

18
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:29,596
i wasn't of that type, infact i haven't
seen any couple living happy

19
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:36,335
i only loved one thing

20
00:04:38,077 --> 00:04:39,066
i date every girl

21
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:43,082
the one who loves me and
who dont love me

22
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,680
and the one who do everything
except love

23
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:51,991
i had only one dream

24
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,321
to work with a director who make
best love stories

25
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,298
my life was perfect

26
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:11,003
leave that and listen to me

27
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,737
veer was a great film maker

28
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:15,712
he made big hit movies

29
00:05:19,786 --> 00:05:21,117
but that movie wasn't my type

30
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,396
i was here for only 2 reasons

31
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,997
there was one more character in my life

32
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,379
he was my senior in office
and my best friend too

33
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,778
kunal was like a villain for every girl

34
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,229
veer was the villain of my life

35
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,233
he sent me to watch this romantic movie

36
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,267
he told me to watch aunty's performance

37
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:25,117
but i didn't know on that day my
life will be change

38
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,422
she turned back and saw me

39
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:04,055

40
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:39,418

If you are so filmy then you must like
these love stories

46
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:36,038
if you dont have any interest in this
movie then just leave

00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:40,215

48
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,711

the use for working?

119

Here girls dont talk to their boyfriends
on the phone

120
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,865

121
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,041

00:28:16,494 --> 00:28:17,324
and he will arrest you

143

281
01:03:58,668 --> 01:03:59,896
it happened with me

282
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:20,417

283
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:22,852
she fell in love

284
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:26,591
and unfortunately i become the part
of her love story

285
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:31,361
simran's girlfriend has come

286
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,595

296
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:12,331

Its time to open the gate again

311
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,149
i told you before simran's graph
has some problem

312
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:25,889

316
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:24,112
You are dead

317
01:11:27,416 --> 01:11:27,882
and simran is the killer

318
01:11:30,052 --> 01:11:30,780
you are in love

319
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,313
you know i'm not like that

320
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,619
everything is clear

321
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:56,907
what are you doing?
Calling simran

322
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:58,941
i was kidding

323
01:12:04,086 --> 01:12:05,178
listen to me

324
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:08,114
have i ever said that i love you?

325
01:12:09,892 --> 01:12:11,917
Have i ever give you any wrong signal?

326
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:16,457
Then why this?
I was just a friend

327
01:12:22,938 --> 01:12:25,668
i dont love you.
You love me

328
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:28,977
yes son

329
01:12:38,053 --> 01:12:39,077
then i realized

330
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,226
i dont know how this happend

331
01:13:09,284 --> 01:13:13,380
daughter relations are not so easy to
break and make

332
01:13:14,957 --> 01:13:16,822
it connects many lives

333
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:20,552
i hope you know what you are doing

334
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:25,758
but i didn't know anything

335
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:30,500
thats why i decided to face
this problem last time

336
01:13:33,475 --> 01:13:35,033
how can she go?

337
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,712
Why you are over reacting?

338
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:50,020
Again call her.
This time her father will pick the phone

339
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:52,619
what is this?

340
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:14,648
Today i can see a new hero

341
01:14:18,220 --> 01:14:19,414
simran's hero

342
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,446
you know its not like that

343
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:26,688
you close your eyes and if you see
her face then you love her

344
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:31,527
listen to me
it works

345
01:15:22,317 --> 01:15:24,114
kunal you go to airport and have
a look

346
01:15:27,723 --> 01:15:28,155

347
01:15:34,496 --> 01:15:35,895
I'm going to say sorry

348
01:15:42,738 --> 01:15:43,864
how can she go?

349
01:15:44,506 --> 01:15:46,030
I wanted to meet her

350
01:16:04,426 --> 01:16:05,586
i thought kunal will come

351
01:16:15,504 --> 01:16:17,631
yesterday i called you

352
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:22,439
you are sick.
You need help

353
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:36,124
simran why this?

354
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:40,157

our friendship

355
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,521
i dont wanna lose them

356
01:17:04,252 --> 01:17:07,483
and the thinking on bed again
started

357
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,513
we dont had anything to say
to each other

358
01:20:35,964 --> 01:20:39,593
how can i know?
Will she take my name board?

359
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,476
How can i recognize her?

360
01:21:14,402 --> 01:21:16,063
I'm veyr confused

361
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:29,848
if she loves me then she will turn
back and see me

362
01:22:32,013 --> 01:22:34,072
i knew what girls will say

363
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:49,964
actually he is pregnant

364
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:58,364
and he stay away from girls

365
01:23:21,262 --> 01:23:23,423
the one whom you are watching

366
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:28,498
its not like that

367
01:23:29,104 --> 01:23:32,164
i'm more experienced than you

368
01:23:32,974 --> 01:23:36,137
and i'm not talking about movies

369
01:23:36,745 --> 01:23:39,475
simran smile has come back

370
01:24:02,704 --> 01:24:06,504
one girl goes and another comes

371
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,950
you dont have to miss that

372
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,310
you dont make this mistake

373
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,444

380
01:26:55,076 --> 01:26:56,338

381
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:09,518
from where that white rose comes?

382
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:12,553
Simran choice is very bad

383
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,196

384
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:27,464
The story must be for raj and simran

385
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,580
there must be a connection between us

386
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:39,584
are you eating alone?

387
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:43,085

393
01:28:19,694 --> 01:28:21,184
You wont take anything?

394
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:27,958
You are alone here?
Without any girl

395
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:49,646
she fell down and her leg
is broken

396
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:54,188
i hope you took her to hospital

397
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:04,828
simran also got wound on her leg

398
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:22,475
veer its not like that

399
01:35:22,883 --> 01:35:24,783
we are just friends

400
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:36,852
i made many films

401
01:35:37,498 --> 01:35:39,022
and i saw more than that

402
01:35:39,633 --> 01:35:43,865
your story is filmy

403
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:46,540
you have done everything

404
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:05,887
if you dont say her your feelings than
you'll lose your last chance

405
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:49,296
i fell in love

406
01:36:50,471 --> 01:36:52,598
and thats the best feeling of the world

407
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:15,118
that magic has done

408
01:37:30,044 --> 01:37:32,342
i felt it when you went away from me

409
01:37:43,257 --> 01:37:50,288
i know raj is also here but if you
are with me then it doesn't matter

410
01:38:17,658 --> 01:38:20,627
you have said that you love me
then i forget everything?

411
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:27,360
I also had said this to you

412
01:38:31,272 --> 01:38:34,435
i took alot of time to
control myself

413
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:40,469
again if you laugh on it then
i wont control myself

414
01:38:41,215 --> 01:38:44,446
my raj forgive me.
How can i do this with her?

415
01:38:46,954 --> 01:38:49,422
How can i do this with myself?

416
01:38:51,258 --> 01:38:54,421
I dont have the power to love you

417
01:39:01,135 --> 01:39:02,500
i love you

418
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:07,930
raj also loves me

419
01:39:14,815 --> 01:39:17,249

420
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:27,349
i fell in love and my heart
was broken

421
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:03,614
everywhere i miss her

422
01:41:08,162 --> 01:41:09,823
sometimes she also comes

423
01:41:24,278 --> 01:41:25,711
i'm also coming first time

424
01:41:26,313 --> 01:41:28,474
where have you been?

425
01:41:31,985 --> 01:41:35,648
Truth is that i was destroyed

426
01:41:36,623 --> 01:41:38,454
i dont know what i do?

427
01:41:41,195 --> 01:41:42,787

If your dad and me did not stayed together,

437
01:42:59,540 --> 01:43:01,599

438

476
01:49:40,473 --> 01:49:42,737
Remaining things were not important

its time to be close with jay

478
01:50:49,209 --> 01:50:51,006
its a foolish plan

479
01:51:00,987 --> 01:51:05,253
in last meeting simran will break

480
01:51:16,770 --> 01:51:20,331

482
01:51:27,213 --> 01:51:29,738

raj also loves her

492
01:52:28,908 --> 01:52:31,138
may be i love her more than raj

493
01:52:31,811 --> 01:52:33,779
but we are not the one who
will decide this

494
01:52:34,547 --> 01:52:36,412
simran is deciding this

495
01:52:41,688 --> 01:52:45,180
this method is correct

496
01:52:45,725 --> 01:52:48,592
simran is agreed for marriage

497
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:58,369
if her decision is wrong then nothing
will happen

498
01:52:58,938 --> 01:53:00,200
she wont go anywhere.
She will come back

499
01:53:18,324 --> 01:53:22,852
dont tell simran about this plan

500
01:56:50,937 --> 01:56:53,132

501
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:59,635

505
01:57:39,919 --> 01:57:42,353

511
02:00:59,552 --> 02:01:01,349

512
02:01:04,423 --> 02:01:05,947

513
02:01:18,004 --> 02:01:19,665
I dont wanna marry

514
02:01:23,843 --> 02:01:27,244

coming here?

515
02:01:30,149 --> 02:01:33,710
May be i will join some school

516
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:52,667
you did not notice whenever you

girls cry on the phone

518
02:02:16,329 --> 02:02:20,595
if you wanna do this drama then do infront
of simran

519
02:02:43,823 --> 02:02:45,017
where are you going?

520
02:05:34,527 --> 02:05:38,429
I was making fun of that,

521
02:05:45,738 --> 02:05:48,707
last time you run away
