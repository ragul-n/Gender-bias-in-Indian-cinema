2
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:22,333
'They are our country's youngsters.'

3
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:26,750
'And also the future of our country.'

4
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,333
'Everything lies in their hands.'

5
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:33,208
'I would like to say this to them.'

6
00:01:33,708 --> 00:01:36,875
'Don't give value for negative thoughts.'

7
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:41,375
'Don't adopt negative ideas.'

8
00:01:41,875 --> 00:01:49,250
'This world's responsibility is in your hands today.'

9
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:52,666
'If our next generation becomes drug addicts...'

10
00:01:53,166 --> 00:01:56,333
'They make their present life as colourful.'

11
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:59,833
'They are playing a deadly game with their future.'

12
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,958
'Intoxication is the cause of all the crimes.'

13
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:04,541
'This film is not only for entertainment.'

14
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,500
'It's a good attempt against the intoxication.'

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
'We thank them, who changes seeing this.'

16
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,500
'Not the one, who just watches it.'

17
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,500
'Mumbai is the dream city.'

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,750
'Thousands of people come here with their dreams.'

19
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,666
'This city doesn't disappoint anybody.'

20
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,875
'People are hard workers and honest here.'

21
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,750
'This city is famous some interesting things.'

22
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,375
'Such as bollywood, underworld...'

23
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:33,125
'Night life and religious place...'

24
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:37,541
'Many beautiful beach and sea link etc.'

25
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,583
'There are two life styles in this city.'

26
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,291
'One side... Tallest buildings.'

27
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:44,083
'And costly shopping mall.'

28
00:02:44,583 --> 00:02:49,291
'Next side... Thousands of huts and dirty roads.'

29
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:53,666
'Intoxication is hidden in both these life styles.'

30
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:58,708
'It destroys our youngster's future here.'

31
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:02,250
'One side... High profile rate parties and discothe.'

32
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,625
'Boys and girls are taking drugs there.'

33
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:10,916
'Another side... These drug addicts are in dirty streets.'

34
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:19,500
'They are being called in different ways.'

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:30,500
'We call these drug addicts as Gardhulle here.'

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,791
'Who are these drug addicts?'

37
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,875
'How did they turn into drug addicts?'

38
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:40,041
'They've got trapped by any drug dealer's net.'

39
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:44,750
'Nobody had analyzed and saw this until now.'

40
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,958
'Why that? They didn't want to see that too.'

41
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:58,291
'We, you, our society and our total system.'

42
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:04,291
'We tried to struggle against this crime by this film.'

43
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:06,666
'To show the fact behind this crime...'

44
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,333
'We've taken a true effort.'

45
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:13,333
'Its name is...'

46
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:42,583
Brother! - Greetings!

47
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:46,583
Give me the bag.

48
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,250
Brother! It's an original stuff from Kashmir.

49
00:05:00,916 --> 00:05:04,416
'Dongiri!'

50
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:26,833
Hey Papu Faluthak!

51
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,041
Do you show your intelligence to me?

52
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:32,166
My name is Zafar Dongiri.

53
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,541
What do you think?

54
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,625
Zafar Dongiri!

55
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,583
What happened?

56
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:42,583
He's spoiled my drug's fragrance.

57
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:52,166
My scene was so too close to me. But I've escaped.

58
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:56,958
My instrument was near me. But I've escaped.

59
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:01,666
The fire that had burnt my home.

60
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,583
It was there in me.

61
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,458
But I've escaped.

62
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:11,458
Papu Faluthak! Bye forever!

63
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,666
Bye forever!

64
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:22,666
Brother! It was a good hunt.

65
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,250
It was lovely.

66
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:28,333
Wonderful! - Exciting!

67
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,083
What do you feel about this murder?

68
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:35,083
Wonderful!

69
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,125
Keep a thing in mind.

70
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:45,791
Whatever we do. We'd do it honestly.

71
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:48,458
My name is Zafar Dongiri.

72
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,416
Do you play with me?

73
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:55,500
I'll excuse everybody only once.

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,958
I'll finish them next time.

75
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:05,333
Javeed! - Yes. - How is our business?

76
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,250
Brother! Our business is so dull.

77
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,500
Why? - An officer has come.

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,500
He's so dangerous.

79
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,458
What's his name?

80
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:19,083
Saavan! - Inspector Saavan!

81
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,416
Yes, brother.

82
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:24,708
Goreghav station.

83
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:25,791
Dongiri brother! Don't worry.

84
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:29,041
The alternative name of trust, is Ashrafkhan.

85
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,916
By order. Okay, brother.

86
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,416
I'll finish the work.

87
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,833
Hey! Through which route you're going?

88
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:39,833
Short cut! - What a short cut is this?

89
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,458
Police station!

90
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,916
Why did you bring me here?

91
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,083
I told you to go to Goreghav station.

92
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,708
Why did you bring me to police station?

93
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:57,791
Is this your short cut?

94
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,916
Saavan! Is that you?

95
00:08:00,416 --> 00:08:01,916
This is your real destination.

96
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:03,875
Shall we go?

97
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,875
Saavan! You...

98
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,583
Arrange to honour our boss. - Take him.

99
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,125
Happy birthday, brother.

100
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,708
Where are you, my brother?

101
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:45,500
I saw you with police on our mom's cremation finally.

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
In the graveyard.

103
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,291
It's many years since this took place.

104
00:08:51,791 --> 00:08:53,750
I'm there in a tragedy here.

105
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,250
Why didn't you come to meet me?

106
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,666
Salma! - I had searched you everywhere.

107
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:00,583
Salma!

108
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,333
How are you, brother?

109
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:08,500
Salma! I've been calling you from so long.

110
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
This is the matter. Lateef!

111
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,833
How many times I asked you to forget him?

112
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,250
Why should I forget him?

113
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,458
He's become a drug addict. So forget him.

114
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:20,833
He's become a drug addict.

115
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,333
Do you know how I got insulted by him?

116
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:29,541
People call me as Drug addict's brother-in-law.

117
00:09:30,041 --> 00:09:31,666
Nobody calls me as Lateef's brother-in-law.

118
00:09:32,166 --> 00:09:32,958
It's better if you forget him.

119
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,416
How can I forget him?

120
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:35,708
He's my brother.

121
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,000
If he's your brother, I'm your husband.

122
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,041
Understand?

123
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:41,750
If you don't forget him...

124
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,875
Listen! You have to forget me.

125
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:48,875
It's a promise on Allah.

126
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,291
Where are you, my brother?

127
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:20,291
Where are you?

128
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,500
Borivali

129
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,625
Kandivali

130
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:30,791
Borivali

131
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:34,791
Kandivali

132
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:41,541
Borivali

133
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,375
Kandivali

134
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:47,375
Borivali

135
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,875
I think he's come with a costly thing.

136
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,416
You don't know this.

137
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,166
He steals rich people's mobile phones.

138
00:10:58,666 --> 00:10:59,750
Where is it?

139
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,791
Give your phone and get the drug.

140
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,583
I can get 2 packs of brown sugar for a mobile phone.

141
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:11,375
You can enjoy in Mumbai until I'm here.

142
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,000
Give me the mobile phone.

143
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,625
Give me I say. - First brown sugar pack.

144
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,833
Is there Mallika in this phone?

145
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,833
You can find it fully. - Fully?

146
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,500
Give me the brown sugar pack.

147
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,291
Give him the brown sugar pack.

148
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:33,291
Everybody is there in this.

149
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:45,708
I think somebody has passed away.

150
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,458
Ambulance has arrived.

151
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,458
Come on. Let's check it.

152
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,541
Come fast! Hurry up!

153
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:09,416
Camera! 'I announce you that there's a dead body here.'

154
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,083
It's there in this place since 3 days.

155
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:13,333
But our Government is least bothered about it.

156
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,125
'I want to tell you this.'

157
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:21,500
'If any leader gets hurt, it becomes a hot news.'

158
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
But a dead body is here since 3 days.

159
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,250
Our Government is least bothered about it.

160
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,416
I want to tell you a matter.

161
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,291
There's no any difference in between a man and dog here.

162
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,541
A dog was dead in Gujrat recently.

163
00:12:35,041 --> 00:12:37,875
Its owner had done its funeral grandly.

164
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,708
He had offered food also to people.

165
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:42,166
He celebrated its 13th day funeral also.

166
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,833
I'm ashamed to tell you this.

167
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,458
A dog had told so to another dog.

168
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,583
Human beings death also will be pathetic.

169
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:52,541
If human beings die like this...

170
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,625
There won't be distinction in between people and animals.

171
00:12:56,125 --> 00:13:00,750
Our channel gave a fast track news to our viewers.

172

So our Government had concentrated on this.

173
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,250
This ambulance van has arrived here.

174
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,500
But nobody had come forward to clear the dead body.

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,833
But drug addicts only are loading the body in it.

176
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,500

00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:38,125
I'm Anush with our cameraman Prohit.

185
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,541
Our end also will be like this.

186
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:50,750
He's got an ambulance.

187
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,000
We won't have that luck too.

188
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,000
Everybody is going to die one day definitely.

189
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
But the day only differs.

190
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,500
Don't worry. Good character people also, die.

191
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,041
Where is the drug? - He's having it.

192
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:08,125
I've taken the drug in a tension.

193
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,291
What can I take, then?

194
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:16,250
I'm upset. Let me go to Bandra station now.

195
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,250
I'll stay there. I can get it there.

196
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:26,166
Come on. He goes to Bandra. Let's go to Dharavi.

197
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:33,666
Sir! Please save me. I'll die.

198
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:37,708
If you don't tell the truth, you'll die.

199
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,708
Tell the truth.

200
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:52,000
Sir! Railway station!

201
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:56,000
Sir!

202
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,250
I can finish your chapter.

203
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,833
But it's better if you tell the truth yourself.

204
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,125
Nobody will find your place.

205
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,791
Nobody can find your case.

206
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:13,875
If you tell the truth, you can go to court.

207
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,541
You'll be alive.

208
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:21,500
If you don't reveal the truth, just think.

209
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where will you go?

210
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,708
Sir! It's true. I'm a honest person.

211
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,583
Hey! You've come to jail. Right?

212
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:38,041
People like you, won't be honest and good.

213
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:39,750
Pandey!

214
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,958
If he doesn't tell the truth, just kill him.

215
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,958
He's just wasting our time and energy.

216
00:15:48,458 --> 00:15:51,833
'Under hit and run case... Our Salmankhan...'

217
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,000
'He's been released under mercy.'

218
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,458
'This is Salmankhan's news.'

219
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,416
'We turn to the next news now.'

220
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,250
'We've got a hot news there.'

221
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,625
'From Mumbai's Dharavi area...'

222
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:03,083
'An anonymous dead body was found there.'

223
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,125
'Over to that spot.'

224
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,583
'Our reporter Anusha is there in that spot.'

225
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,416
'An anonymous dead body was found there.'

226
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,125
'Nobody had helped to clear this body.'

227
00:16:12,625 --> 00:16:13,500
'Only drug addicts had helped us.'

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,416
'Our reporter Anusha had told that...'

229
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:18,333
'Nobody should take drugs.' - Lateef brother!

230
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,083
'Nobody cares about this.'

231
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:22,416
'When our Government will wake up from sleep?'

232
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,458
'This incident was in Mumbai's Mahim Dharavi.'

233
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:29,250
Mahim! - ' A drug addict was dead.'

234
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:35,666
You man! - Yes, ma'am.

235
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,875
Take it. Make it properly. Brothers have come.

236
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:42,500
Okay!

237
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,208
See! Our business is not so good.

238
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,041
Take today's matter.

239
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,958
Police has taken fifty percentage of money.

240
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,166
He said that the section is tight.

241
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,000
We'd buy the stuff properly.

242
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,708
Raid also is expected from the higher officials.

243
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,666
Narcotex people also has disturbed us.

244
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,666
We could not import our stuff properly.

245
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:05,041
I only know the difficulties of my business.

246
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:09,041
Take it, ma'am. It's a perfect drug mixture.

247
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,833
Take it, Patel. Just try it.

248
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:24,291
This intoxication will reduce your stress.

249
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:28,166
You enjoy and I will sing for you.

250
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:32,166
I'll chant your name only always.

251
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,000
Take it, Boomai! Enjoy it I say.

252
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,291
Diamond seeds into this golden pipe.

253
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,333
Who takes this smoke, he's Mumbai's don.

254
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:55,541
Vow! Wonderful!

255
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:58,500
Crores of treasure in lakhs of business.

256
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,666
If we open it, this piece will be like a ball.

257
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:07,125
If we try it, we can enjoy each and every second.

258
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,208
Lebidu! You try it. - Give me.

259
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:14,208
Thanks for giving this smoke.

260
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,708
We can enjoy until we have this habit.

261
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,083
It's hard to understand its fact.

262
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:28,083
Whatever it is. We can enjoy here really.

263
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,666
Take it, Banjal. You also try it.

264
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,791
We demand money from rich people.

265
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,333
What will we demand the poor people?

266
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:58,000
'Vow! Wonderful I say!'

267
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,666
Well said! For whom we are alive?

268
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:07,250
For whom do we survive here?

269
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,333
Okay. Let me say now. Everybody is waiting.

270
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,958
You can't get a false news here.

271
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,625
We'd have got arrested.

272
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,416
Your information won't be wrong.

273
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:22,625
But... Shall I tell you a thing while leaving?

274
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,666
Your stuff is so powerful.

275
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,250
Kashmiri drugs. Right?

276
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,916
Okay. Let me move.

277
00:19:28,416 --> 00:19:30,000
Bye, Banjal.

278
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,125
We're excited. Come on.

279
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,958
Deliver drugs to Dongiri brother's party sharply by eve.

280
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,958
I'll deliver it. - Go, man.

281
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:10,375
"Kashmir! Once again! Kashmir!"

282
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:14,666
"Spread your magic in this right world."

283
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:19,000
"Where else can we get this excitement?"

284
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,833
"Let's forget this whole world in kick."

285
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:31,416
"Drug addicts! Let's forget this world's pain."

286
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:44,750
"Drug addicts! Let's forget this world's pain."

287
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:48,750
"Drug addicts!"

288
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:06,666
"Let's have a smoke and fall in intoxication."

289
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:15,000
"Let's jump into the excitement."

290
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:19,208
"It's an intoxication. We're unconscious."

291
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:23,375
"We're enjoying this world's beauty truly."

292
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,750
"Let's forget this whole world in kick."

293
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:36,458
"Drug addicts! Let's forget this world's pain."

294
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:46,916
"Drug addicts! Let's forget this world's pain."

295
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:50,916
"Hats off, drug addicts."

296
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:14,250
Until when you can stay with your parents?

297
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,166
Did you grab my mobile without knowing about me?

298
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,875
You don't know about my dad.

299
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:20,125
I'm not interested in knowing that too.

300
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:23,166
You scoundrel! - If my dad comes to know this...

301
00:22:23,666 --> 00:22:24,166
You'll see its consequence.

302
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,416
Hey! Inform his dad and remand him. Come on.

303
00:22:26,916 --> 00:22:30,416
Come on. Move!

304
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:41,416
God! Tell me why you had created girls.

305
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:44,500
Vow! Wonderful!

306
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,375
Brother! Hatele's call.

307
00:22:46,875 --> 00:22:47,833
Hatele's call.

308
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:50,333
Yes. - Brother! Police raid in our party.

309
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:55,250
How? - ACP Saavan had raided in our party.

310
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,666
Dongiri! - He's arrested everybody.

311
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,083
They won't be released it seems.

312
00:22:59,583 --> 00:23:00,291
What can I do now?

313
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:03,291
Okay. Call me later on.

314
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:08,333
Batley! - Yes. - I want to know the police informer.

315
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,875
I need his name in just 2 days. Go.

316
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:14,875
Okay, brother.

317
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,750
We have to make it fast. - Go. Hurry up.

318
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,958
'I think I had seen this guy only with Lateef in T.V.'

319
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,250
'Let me check it.'

320
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:44,750
Hurry up! Why do you delay?

321
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:52,375
Why do you talk so? I'm doing it fast.

322
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:53,375
Brother!

323
00:23:53,875 --> 00:23:57,541
Listen! - Is that I? - No. That guy.

324
00:23:58,041 --> 00:24:00,083
That ma'am is calling you. - Brother!

325
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:04,083
Is it? Come on. Let's enquire her. - I'll come.

326
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:18,291
Do you know him?

327
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:23,541
He's our friend Lateef. See this.

328
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:28,291
He's our friend Lateef. - Do you know his place?

329
00:24:28,791 --> 00:24:30,083
Did he do rob anything?

330
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:34,041
Lateef will never do that.

331
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,041
He's a good guy, ma'am.

332
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:39,166
But... Why do you need him?

333
00:24:39,666 --> 00:24:42,583
I'm this Lateef's sister.

334
00:24:43,083 --> 00:24:46,541
I've been searching my brother with frustration.

335
00:24:47,041 --> 00:24:53,500
Please! If you find his address, please inform me.

336
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,416
Lateef was not there with us yesterday.

337
00:24:55,916 --> 00:24:58,625
No. He'd have gone only after informing you.

338
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,208
After loading the dead body into the van yesterday.

339
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,208
He told me that he goes to Bandra to meet Ajith.

340
00:25:05,708 --> 00:25:10,041
Not to Ajith. I know his place.

341
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:11,708
Please tell me, then.

342
00:25:12,208 --> 00:25:14,250
I'll be grateful to you lifelong.

343
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:19,541
He might have gone to his girl friend Rina's home.

344
00:25:20,041 --> 00:25:21,750
I know that well. In Kherwadi.

345
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,541
Yes. If we find him, we'll inform you definitely.

346
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,166
Come on.

347
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:30,000
Lateef!

348
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,958
Where are you?

349
00:25:33,458 --> 00:25:40,250
This will be so powerful. It'll descend in you.

350
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,916
Listen to me!

351
00:25:45,416 --> 00:25:48,916
People are begging alms and robbing for drugs.

352
00:25:53,416 --> 00:26:00,583
Did you see anybody struggling for life?

353
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:04,583
That's all. I've seen a person like that.

354
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:13,750
If we see a ghost in kick, It'll also occupy us.

355
00:26:27,541 --> 00:26:30,041
Look here.

356
00:26:30,541 --> 00:26:30,750
Such a ghost.

357
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:34,875
"We have fallen in kick."

358
00:26:35,375 --> 00:26:43,083
"Let's fall on the land and enjoy a lot."

359
00:26:43,583 --> 00:26:47,333
"It's an intoxication. We are unconscious here."

360
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:51,416
"We won't be tired with our world by this."

361
00:26:51,916 --> 00:26:53,708
I'm Imran Azmi!

362
00:26:54,208 --> 00:26:57,875
And I'm Mallika Sharavat.

363
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:05,041
"Drug addicts! We'll forget this world's pain."

364
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,833
I've joined with you only for this.

365
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:13,500
You people are serving to poor girls and widows.

366
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,583
Who thinks about this today?

367
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:19,583
Nobody! People have made politics as a business now.

368
00:27:28,541 --> 00:27:32,750
Pandey! - Sir! - Call this number and trace his details.

369
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:36,750
Okay, sir.

370
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:44,333
'The number you're trying, is out of order.'

371
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:48,333
Sir! Number is out of service.

372
00:27:52,791 --> 00:28:01,666
Mobile has corrupted our system totally.

373
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:06,166
We can buy these Sim cards easily.

374
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:09,166
They do their work and throw away the Sim cards.

375
00:28:09,666 --> 00:28:14,333
But it's our problem. Nothing to worry.

376
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,708
Trace its details from the company.

377
00:28:17,208 --> 00:28:17,875
Yes, sir.

378
00:28:18,375 --> 00:28:23,291
Where we arrested them? I need all the call details around it.

379
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,125
Yes, sir.

380
00:28:24,625 --> 00:28:26,875
Let me also check it.

381
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:30,791
Who is the culprit?

382
00:28:31,291 --> 00:28:32,958
Patil sir! Sameer brother!

383
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:35,000
Please wait outside for a while.

384
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,000
With pleasure!

385
00:28:40,708 --> 00:28:44,208
Ring this number. - Yes, sir.

386
00:28:50,708 --> 00:28:54,875
Don't pick it up! - Yes, sir.

387
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,750
It may be from anybody's father.

388
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,916
Sir! It's ringing. But nobody picks up the call.

389
00:29:01,416 --> 00:29:04,000
Doesn't this policeman pick up my call?

390
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,250
Doesn't he pick up my call? Try his mobile no.

391
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,500
Sir. He doesn't have a mobile phone.

392
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,500
Sir! Let me ring to Shinde.

393
00:29:19,458 --> 00:29:23,000
Sir! Shinde is there on line.

394
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,541
Shinde! - Yes, sir.

395
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:26,083
Give the phone to Saavan. - Yes, sir.

396
00:29:26,583 --> 00:29:27,125
Sir! Call for you.

397
00:29:27,625 --> 00:29:28,333
Whose father is this?

398
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:32,333
Minister's call.

399
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,250
Greets, sir. - What's this?

400
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:43,166
Have you arrested decent family children?

401
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:46,500
What did those innocent children do?

402
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,166
If you put them into the jail...

403
00:29:49,666 --> 00:29:51,083
They will become criminals.

404
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,916
Give them an opportunity to change.

405
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:55,791
Warn them and release them.

406
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,916
But sir... - It's my order.

407
00:29:58,416 --> 00:30:00,708
If you want to fight, do it with them.

408
00:30:01,208 --> 00:30:04,500
Who spreads this poison in this city.

409
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,333
I'll also support you in that.

410
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,875
We have to end this from the root.

411
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:13,875
Okay!

412
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,500
Listen! I'm releasing you all today.

413
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,333
But if I find you in such a place again...

414
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:36,041
You'd be punished at that time.

415
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:38,458
Shinde! - Yes, sir. - Release them.

416
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:42,458
Okay, sir.

417
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,291
Understood!

418
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,625
You've got admired by a girl.

419
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,708
Shop is closed. You'd not sell your stuff.

420
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,375
Do you demand the stuff for free now?

421
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:20,333
Give me. I'll settle your money tomorrow itself.

422
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,625
Okay. I trust you.

423
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:26,041
Bring Nagad Narayanan by tomorrow. Or...

424
00:31:26,541 --> 00:31:31,333
I swear. I'll bring him. Or you'll kill us.

425
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:35,333
Take it.

426
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:48,291
Listen!

427
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:52,291
Come here.

428
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,083
Give up this habit.

429
00:31:56,583 --> 00:31:58,000
There's no any path behind this.

430
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,000
There's no any destination.

431
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,041
Death is its only one destination.

432
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:07,541
You'll be found as a dead body on foot path.

433
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:11,375
People will scold you as a drug addict is dead.

434
00:32:11,875 --> 00:32:13,500
Government's dead body van will come and take you.

435
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,791
It'll just clear the street.

436
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,833
People will close their nose and speak about you.

437
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:24,750
Nobody will pray to rest your soul in peace.

438
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:27,541
Stop your bad habit.

439
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:28,916
Stop today itself.

440
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:32,916
Do you listen to me?

441
00:32:37,625 --> 00:32:38,500
I can tackle my life.

442
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,916
"I had many more dreams."

443
00:32:44,416 --> 00:32:48,625
You'll pass away in young age itself.

444
00:32:49,125 --> 00:33:01,625
"This intoxication has changed their bright life."

445
00:33:02,125 --> 00:33:04,750
Hey! Why do you come here with a dull face?

446
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:09,458
Hey! Where have you been for these days?

447
00:33:09,958 --> 00:33:14,083
I thought that somebody had owned you.

448
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:19,166
Did you think about me? You go to her.

449
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,208
Where should I go? - Your girl friend.

450
00:33:22,708 --> 00:33:24,333
Who is that?

451
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,291
Hey! Get out of here.

452
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:27,250
Who is that? Tell me.

453
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,000
Get out of here. Why do you question me? - Hey!

454
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,583
Who's that? Tell me her name.

455
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:34,458
You know about her. Leave the place.

456
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,166
Where should I go? I won't go to anybody else.

457
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:37,750
You go to her.

458
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,208
Are you crazy?

459
00:33:39,708 --> 00:33:41,500
Won't you get out of here?

460
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,500
You go.

461
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,458
To whom should I go?

462
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:50,875
Tell me her name first.

463
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:54,875
Go!

464
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:03,250
To whom should I go? Tell her name.

465
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,208
Do you know my real love on you?

466
00:34:07,708 --> 00:34:09,500
Go to your Rina.

467
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,250
Rina! - Yes. Your Rina.

468
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,250
Go to her.

469
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,833
Rina calls me as brother.

470
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:23,708
She loves Ajay. She is Ajay's lover.

471
00:34:24,208 --> 00:34:27,500
You're my lover. - You're lying.

472
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:28,500
How can I explain you?

473
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,750
Shall I slit my hand to prove my love?

474
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:33,791
Shall I get you moon and stars?

475
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:35,583
Shall I jump from here? See! I'll do it for you.

476
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:40,000
Shall I jump? - No. Come here.

477
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:44,000
Are you crazy?

478
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,833
Did you see them?

479
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,500
How deeply they both love each other?

480
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,541
Yes. I'm watching them.

481
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:58,875
Learn from them. They are better than you.

482
00:34:59,375 --> 00:35:01,166
They both love each other so deeply.

483
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,166
Okay. Come on. Let's move.

484
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:09,708
Will you accept me? - Will you obey my words?

485
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,625
I'll obey your words.

486
00:35:13,125 --> 00:35:13,583
Tell me. What should I do?

487
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:18,500
Give me that. - What's it? Brown sugar pack.

488
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,291
Did you come to the same place again?

489
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:24,916
Give me the brown sugar pack.

490
00:35:25,416 --> 00:35:28,541
I've brought it just now under credit basis.

491
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:32,541
I didn't settle this amount also yet.

492
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,750
Take it.

493
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,458
Don't ask me money.

494
00:35:44,958 --> 00:35:48,625
You'll have money. Show me. - No money!

495
00:35:49,125 --> 00:35:51,500
Here. - Hey! I don't have money.

496
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,791
Don't you have money? Promise?

497
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:57,083
Yes. If I have money, why should I demand you?

498
00:35:57,583 --> 00:36:01,083
Stop it. Search it first.

499
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:08,791
This car... Look at there.

500
00:36:09,291 --> 00:36:10,958
See there.

501
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:18,458
Let me sell my stuff to them. Okay?

502
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:19,958
Police will punish you for that.

503
00:36:20,458 --> 00:36:23,833
Why police? Don't talk about police to me.

504
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:28,500
They will arrest us and release the rich people.

505
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,458
They will arrest us and name us as criminals.

506
00:36:33,958 --> 00:36:35,541
Don't talk about police to me.

507
00:36:36,041 --> 00:36:37,958
Policemen are good and not like you.

508
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:39,041
I'm so good.

509
00:36:39,541 --> 00:36:42,916
I have got big eyes. See here.

510
00:36:43,416 --> 00:36:46,916
Am I not looking good? - Good. Open it I say.

511
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:55,666
Light it, man.

512
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:00,166
Pour it in this.

513
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:03,625
Take that pipe too.

514
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:07,625
Smell it.

515
00:37:09,291 --> 00:37:13,958
'ACP Saavan had arrested rich guys in a party last night.'

516
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:17,500
'He released them for minister Narayan Dutt Agarwal's request.'

517
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,625
'Minister told that nothing would happen by arresting them.'

518
00:37:24,125 --> 00:37:26,125
'If we want to solve this problem from the root...'

519
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:31,958
'We'd end them, who spread this poison in our city.'

520
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,416
'Minister told that Zafar Dongiri is involved in this.'

521
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:36,416
'Or somebody else...'

522
00:37:36,916 --> 00:37:38,416
'Whoever is involved. We won't leave them.'

523
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:43,166
'We'll get them a severe punishment for spreading this poison.'

524
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:46,500
'This lesson is for our next young generation.'

525
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:47,666
'Today's news is over.'

526
00:37:48,166 --> 00:37:51,666
'Watch News India for the updated news.'

527
00:38:02,708 --> 00:38:09,375
I've come to your home to improve your future.

528
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,458
Why did you come suddenly, Dongiri?

529
00:38:11,958 --> 00:38:12,500
Dear! You get inside.

530
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:22,916
Hey! Don't you like my arrival?

531
00:38:23,416 --> 00:38:24,666
Dongiri!

532
00:38:25,166 --> 00:38:27,833
What did you tell in T.V?

533
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:31,166
Will you destroy Zafar Dongiri?

534
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:34,083
Will you destroy my business from the root?

535
00:38:34,583 --> 00:38:36,833
Hey! What do you mean?

536
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:39,750
Do you talk haughty with him? Get out.

537
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,250
If you scold our boss, I'll finish your chapter.

538
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,250
Hey! See this. - Patil sir! You please go out.

539
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:59,750
Dongiri! I won't cause any problem to you.

540
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:04,833
Did the news channel telecast wrongly, then?

541
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:08,750
What they show in our politics, we won't do that.

542
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,791
What we do, that won't be shown.

543
00:39:12,291 --> 00:39:17,791
Dongiri! Did you ever hear about Chanakya?

544
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:23,541
Leave it. I had born there, where politics had born.

545
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:30,041
I grew up there, where politics had grown.

546
00:39:30,541 --> 00:39:32,500
Uttarpradesh!

547
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,541
I rule in our country's capital Delhi.

548
00:39:39,041 --> 00:39:42,541
Leave it. You can't understand these.

549
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:50,333
I can understand only one thing.

550
00:39:50,833 --> 00:39:55,291
Let me tell you an adage. You also hear it.

551
00:39:55,791 --> 00:39:56,791
Okay, boss.

552
00:39:57,291 --> 00:40:03,833
How can you reduce the blood's colour by water?

553
00:40:04,333 --> 00:40:07,208
When you murder others, how can you hide yourself?

554
00:40:07,708 --> 00:40:13,500
Wonderful, boss. - Thank you.

555
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Let me move, minister.

556
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Bye!

557
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,500
Bye!

558
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:27,625
He thinks himself as a tiger by hunting others.

559
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,625
It's our bad luck. Leaders use such fools for their work.

560
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,291
Move fast!

561
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:36,291
Come on.

562
00:41:45,208 --> 00:41:52,500
Greetings, sir. - How do you do? - Fine. - Take it.

563
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,250
Okay, sir. - Saavan sir had sent it. - Okay.

564
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,625
Just for your information about party.

565
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,750
Okay. - If you pass us informations, we'll honour you.

566
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:02,750
Don't worry, sir. I'll pass you all the informations.

567
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:12,916
Tell me. - We've found that informer. What should we do?

568
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:15,791
Why do you think? Murder him.

569
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:19,791
Okay, boss.

570
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:33,041
Scream well. Do you work as an informer?

571
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:37,375
Leave me. - Do you like to be an informer?

572
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:41,375
You go to heaven and enjoy now.

573
00:42:46,208 --> 00:42:48,125
Hello! - Sir! They had hurt our informer by a knife.

574
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,875
He's serious. It's hard to save him.

575
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:53,458
Sir! A bad news.

576
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,583
What happened? - They attacked our informer.

577
00:42:57,083 --> 00:43:00,583
Sir! It's hard to save him.

578
00:43:03,041 --> 00:43:06,541
Scoundrel! Ali! I think that they had traced him.

579
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,208
Hey! Why do you enter inside?

580
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:19,375
Sir! Her condition is so critical.

581
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,416
Do you have money for her treatment?

582
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,208
Can you bring her instantly here?

583
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,958
I can pay you. - What a case is this?

584
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:29,875
What case? You people are looking like a case.

585
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,583
Brother! What's the use in saving you people?

586
00:43:33,083 --> 00:43:33,875
Drug addicts have come.

587
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,958
Sir! Let's discuss later on. Emergency.

588
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:40,041
Sister! Her condition is critical.

589
00:43:40,541 --> 00:43:41,250
Emergency case.

590
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,916
You have to fill up the form first.

591
00:43:43,416 --> 00:43:44,083
Doctor will check her after that.

592
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:49,166
I'll fill it up later on. See her condition.

593
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:53,166
Go and sit in the line.

594
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,875
Nothing serious.

595
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,583
Nothing serious.

596
00:44:03,083 --> 00:44:05,208
Sister! Please call the doctor.

597
00:44:05,708 --> 00:44:07,916
I told you to fill up the form first.

598
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:08,916
Doctor will check her after that.

599
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:11,875
I'll fill up the form later on. I won't escape.

600
00:44:12,375 --> 00:44:13,125
Just see her condition.

601
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:16,791
Sir! Please call the doctor immediately.

602
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:20,375
Please bear it. Ma'am! Sir!

603
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,125
Ma'am! Please call the doctor.

604
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,750
She's dying there.

605
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:29,291
Why should we call the doctor? - She's dying.

606
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:33,458
Hey! Go. - What?

607
00:44:33,958 --> 00:44:37,458
Sir! Don't your have mercy? She's dying.

608
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:46,916
Doctor! She's an emergency case.

609
00:44:47,416 --> 00:44:51,166
Doctor! Her... - Check bed no.30 patient. - Okay.

610
00:44:51,666 --> 00:44:53,416
Her condition is critical. - Sorry! My duty is over.

611
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:57,458
That's okay. Please spend sometime for her. - Sorry.

612
00:44:57,958 --> 00:45:00,500
Please save her. What's there in duty?

613
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,208
Her condition is critical. But nobody cares here.

614
00:45:04,708 --> 00:45:08,875
Ma'am! Call the doctor.

615
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:16,375
Mona! - What happened?

616
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:22,500
Doctor! She's... - What happened?

617
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,666
Mona! - What happened?

618
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:27,958
What happened?

619
00:45:28,458 --> 00:45:32,000
What? She's dead. - Is she dead?

620
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,666
Oh my god! - Oh my god!

621
00:45:36,166 --> 00:45:38,041
Oh my god what?

622
00:45:38,541 --> 00:45:41,583
For what you blame the god?

623
00:45:42,083 --> 00:45:43,416
She's dead by your carelessness.

624
00:45:43,916 --> 00:45:44,458
What do you mean?

625
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,000
Mind your language.

626
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,625
What do you mean?

627
00:45:48,125 --> 00:45:51,750
I don't blabber here. This is the fact.

628
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,916
Ask to everybody here.

629
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:56,083
I was running like a mad for half an hour.

630
00:45:56,583 --> 00:45:59,291
But nobody bothered to listen me.

631
00:45:59,791 --> 00:46:01,333
The patient is fighting for her life.

632
00:46:01,833 --> 00:46:03,541
And nurse is saying fill the form first.

633
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,541
And doctor is saying my duty is off.

634
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:10,000
This is not a proper way to handle emergency.

635
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:12,500
There's no such rule in medical science.

636
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,625
Okay?

637
00:46:15,125 --> 00:46:19,958
I was also a medical student.

638
00:46:20,458 --> 00:46:23,958
But my condition is bad now.

639
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,041
You people are called us gods on earth.

640
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:32,375
But you people are behaving like demons.

641
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:35,708
See her. - I'm sorry, young man.

642
00:46:36,208 --> 00:46:40,125
Bull shit! For what?

643
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:43,791
Everything is lost.

644
00:46:44,291 --> 00:46:47,708
Go and enjoy.

645
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:51,708
My duty is off.

646
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:15,250
"World has filled up the hatred poison in their heart."

647
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:20,500
"World has filled up the hatred poison in their heart."

648
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,500
"We are suppose to live a deadly life."

649
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,875
Hello! - Hey minister!

650
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:43,416
How many times I restricted you to call this no?

651
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:45,333
Don't you know?

652
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:47,500
Phone tapings are going now a days.

653
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,916
You leaders are so dangerous.

654
00:47:51,416 --> 00:47:54,500
It's 3 days since Saavan had arrested my man.

655
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,125
No details about my mind and my stuff.

656
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,875
Answer me for that, man.

657
00:47:59,375 --> 00:48:02,833
Relax, Dongiri. - Why should I be calm?

658
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:06,125
What a minister you're?

659
00:48:06,625 --> 00:48:09,500
Can't you transfer an ordinary police officer?

660
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,791
If you can't do it, tell me. I'll do it.

661
00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,708
Dongiri!

662
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:18,041
Just relax. Don't be tensed.

663
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:23,500
I'll take care of this matter.

664
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,500
Otherwise I'll finish your chapter, minister.

665
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,708
Leader! I went to meet Aziz yesterday.

666
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:35,791
In the hospital.

667
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,791
A drug addict had brought his girl friend in a critical state.

668
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:40,958
He had shouted louder.

669
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:46,000
Doctor! Check her. I'm also a medical student.

670
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:50,166
But no duty doctor had bothered about him.

671
00:48:50,666 --> 00:48:51,916
Everybody considered him as a living dead body.

672
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:53,500
They had ignored him.

673
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,333
That girl had passed away in front of me.

674
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,833
Oh pity, Baasha brother.

675
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:01,666
But tell me... What can I do for you?

676
00:49:02,166 --> 00:49:03,583
You can do many more things.

677
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:08,000
I know that you're a true and honest leader.

678
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,125
You can destroy these drugs Mophia completely.

679
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:13,541
I pray you.

680
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:15,916
Please take an effort regarding this.

681
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:18,458
Save our youngsters from destruction, leader.

682
00:49:18,958 --> 00:49:20,375
Baasha brother! I know.

683
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,500
Who is there behind this?

684
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,125
Narayan Dutt Agarwal is there behind it.

685
00:49:26,625 --> 00:49:28,708
But we must go to him and talk to him.

686
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:30,458
I'll talk to him.

687
00:49:30,958 --> 00:49:34,416
If he doesn't agree, I'll struggle against him on street.

688
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:37,208
I'll support. Don't worry, Basha brother.

689
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:38,875
Thanks a lot.

690
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:40,833
Get us a positive judgment.

691
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,000
Greetings!

692
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,708
Kulkarni! You know that drug Mophia has spoiled our city.

693
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:47,708
I know that, sir.

694
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:56,500
Drugs Mophia had spread their business in all the areas.

695
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,166
Not only this.

696
00:49:58,666 --> 00:50:02,750
They've begun drugs supply in Mumbai's schools and colleges.

697
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:06,291
Many more students have fallen into this.

698
00:50:06,791 --> 00:50:13,500
They've become addicts of ink thinner and drugs.

699
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,500
Drug Mophia are intelligent.

700
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,125
They store less quantity of marijuana only.

701
00:50:20,625 --> 00:50:21,625
When they are being trapped...

702
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:27,375
They sell their stuff for lower rates by self injection.

703
00:50:27,875 --> 00:50:31,708
This is the matter, Kulkarni.

704
00:50:32,208 --> 00:50:34,208
People say that police is not doing anything.

705
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:37,916
What can our police department do?

706
00:50:38,416 --> 00:50:44,875
Anyway... I have to reach the root of this drug Mophia.

707
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:45,875
Understand?

708
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,500
Yes, sir.

709
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:48,500
Greetings, sir.

710
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,500
Sir!

711
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:58,083
Tell me. What's the matter?

712
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:04,416
This is my brother Lateef's photo.

713
00:51:04,916 --> 00:51:05,375
What happened to him?

714
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:08,833
Sir! His life has been spoiled.

715
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:11,666
He was studying very well.

716
00:51:12,166 --> 00:51:16,833
I don't know for what police had arrested him.

717
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:19,583
I don't know what cases they had filed on him.

718
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:23,958
Lateef didn't come home after 7 years of imprisonment.

719
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:26,125
I'm waiting for him here.

720
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,375
I don't know where he went.

721
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:33,208
People say that he's become a drug addict.

722
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:37,458
Sir! Please find him in anyway.

723
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:40,375
I'll be grateful to you lifelong.

724
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:44,291
Okay. Give your address and contact no to duty officer.

725
00:51:44,791 --> 00:51:47,666
If we get any details about him, we'll inform you.

726
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:53,041
Okay. Thank you, sir.

727
00:51:53,541 --> 00:51:57,750
Kulkarni! - Sir! Keep this photo safe.

728
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,125
He may leader you to your destination.

729
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:04,791
I'll take you to your destination.

730
00:52:05,291 --> 00:52:07,500
I'll promote you also.

731
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,333
It'll happen, when you work with dedication for us.

732
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:15,666
Should I work for you, minister?

733
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:19,125
You had called me at night to release those guys.

734
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:20,458
I had released them,.

735
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:23,208
Tell me now. What else should I do for you?

736
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:28,500
Release Ashraf Kashmiri, whom you arrested.

737
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,666
Ashraf Kashmiri!

738
00:52:31,166 --> 00:52:34,000
I'm hearing this name for the first time.

739
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:41,791
You can check our station and this lock up.

740
00:52:42,291 --> 00:52:43,541
He's not here, isn't it?

741
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:46,875
Minister! Who had told you this?

742
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:50,791
I'll tell you that name later on.

743
00:52:51,291 --> 00:52:54,500
We have to think this now. Where did he go?

744
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,500
Saavan! Do you play with us?

745
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,791
You people are playing, minister.

746
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:02,500
That too using your influence.

747
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,750
We'll play and make others to play also.

748
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,625
We will win also.

749
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:12,625
Mind it, Saavan. This is my department.

750
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,625
Why do you laugh?

751
00:53:24,125 --> 00:53:24,875
Why do you laugh?

752
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:30,875
Regarding the department matter.

753
00:53:31,375 --> 00:53:36,291
Department... - Saavan!

754
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:40,291
It's yours, minister!

755
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:48,125
He's been used it.

756
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,666
Congratulations, M.L.A.

757
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:53,875
But if any media person sees this...

758
00:53:54,375 --> 00:53:58,500
What is an opposition M.L.A doing in ruling minister's home?

759
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,916
This will be the headline in tomorrow's news paper.

760
00:54:01,416 --> 00:54:03,125
I've come to tell you this.

761
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:07,416
You're supporting anti social activities indirectly.

762
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:11,333
Give it up. - Do I support anti social activities?

763
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:13,000
Are you crazy?

764
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,500
Are you in consciousness?

765
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,291
You're my political guide.

766
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:22,291
That's why I'm giving you respect.

767
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:27,291
If you don't give up your friendship with Dongiri...

768
00:54:27,791 --> 00:54:31,208
I'll suppose you in front of the media.

769
00:54:31,708 --> 00:54:35,208
Greetings!

770
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:52,708
"Our fate has spoiled our dreams totally."

771
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:57,666
"Our fate has spoiled our dreams totally."

772
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:07,500
"Drugs have changed our fate completely."

773
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,416
"It's changed our life."

774
00:55:12,916 --> 00:55:17,333
"It's changed our life."

775
00:55:17,833 --> 00:55:22,250
"It's changed our life."

776
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:26,250
"It's changed our life."

777
00:55:49,666 --> 00:55:54,125
"They've done a job to regret lifelong."

778
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:59,375
"Though I'm not guilty."

779
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:05,125
It'll be written on cigarette pocket in small letters.

780
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:10,583
Cigarette smoking is injurious to health.

781
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,541
Big companies produce it and it's sold in an open market.

782
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:22,458
People are smoking it. We'd write this in our drugs.

783
00:56:22,958 --> 00:56:26,458
'Sure short death.'

784
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:31,500
Who wants to die? He'll use it.

785
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,750
No police threat. Big companies will produce it.

786
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:39,291
It'll be sold in open market with healthy competition.

787
00:56:39,791 --> 00:56:45,583
Price will reduce. We can consume it peacefully.

788
00:56:46,083 --> 00:56:46,750
Shall I tell you another matter?

789
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:50,750
You've spoken too much.

790
00:56:54,166 --> 00:56:56,791
You gave a big speech. Stop it.

791
00:56:57,291 --> 00:56:59,916
If we get a thing... - Lateef!

792
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:04,000
Patel! - He's looking like Lateef.

793
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,583
Take it fast. Give it to me.

794
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:10,583
Give me. - Take it. Patel!

795
00:57:15,916 --> 00:57:21,291
Take it. - Brother!

796
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:23,541
Brothers! Greetings!

797
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:26,541
Give me also.

798
00:57:27,041 --> 00:57:29,333
Sit here. - I'll sit.

799
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:32,833
Don't mistake me. - We won't mistake you here.

800
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:38,458
Sit! - Give me. I'm so glad in seeing you guys.

801
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,000
We have brown sugar. - What does it mean?

802
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:50,416
Stuff! - I've bought it in that street. - Give him.

803
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:53,500
I'm checking the quality.

804
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,125
Give me some.

805
00:57:57,625 --> 00:58:03,500
Give me. - It's not powerful. - He gave me 2 packs.

806
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,541
Give me the next one. I'll check its quality.

807
00:58:06,041 --> 00:58:08,000
Don't take it. I won't give you.

808
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,833
Brother! You check it. - Give me.

809
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:11,541
But please teach me to try it.

810
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:13,083
From where did you bring it?

811
00:58:13,583 --> 00:58:17,791
A guy gave me this behind that 3rd street.

812
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:19,875
He was short. He gave me this.

813
00:58:20,375 --> 00:58:21,125
Why did you go there?

814
00:58:21,625 --> 00:58:24,458
My hat shop is there. I've closed that and come.

815
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:26,708
Give me your hat.

816
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:29,083
My shop piece. - Do you have this habit?

817
00:58:29,583 --> 00:58:31,958
I've come for the first time.

818
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:36,208
How do I look? - Wonderful. - Handsome.

819
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:39,041
You're good. - He looks like Sharukh.

820
00:58:39,541 --> 00:58:42,916
No. He looks like Devanand.

821
00:58:43,416 --> 00:58:48,333
I'm so crazy. - Belt. This is my pen.

822
00:58:48,833 --> 00:58:49,791
Small children will use this.

823
00:58:50,291 --> 00:58:51,833
Don't do this. I'm shying.

824
00:58:52,333 --> 00:58:53,041
Kids will use it. Right?

825
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:55,000
Feed him milk, then.

826
00:58:55,500 --> 00:59:01,291
Kids will drink milk. See there. Milk shop.

827
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,041
Go and drink that. - I want this drug.

828
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,041
Shall I tell you a thing? I'm longing to taste it.

829
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:12,041
I tell you the truth. It's not a good thing.

830
00:59:12,541 --> 00:59:14,041
Didn't you ever try this? - No.

831
00:59:14,541 --> 00:59:19,500
Don't try it. Your life will be spoiled.

832
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,833
This world will start hating you.

833
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,208
Do you listen?

834
00:59:24,708 --> 00:59:26,500
This world will start hating you.

835
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,541
Your honour will be spoiled in this society.

836
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:35,166
You'll die and the corporation lorry will take your body.

837
00:59:35,666 --> 00:59:40,625
Did you listen? - If it's so bad, why do you use it?

838
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:45,333
I... - Listen! Take your hat.

839
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:49,666
We have some reflections of our past.

840
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,958
We have bitter experiences and pain.

841
00:59:52,458 --> 00:59:59,875
This intoxication will reduce our painful feelings.

842
01:00:00,375 --> 01:00:01,375
That's why we use it.

843
01:00:01,875 --> 01:00:05,458
What will this intoxication reduce?

844
01:00:05,958 --> 01:00:09,666
It's drug addicts area. Our sir is on leave.

845
01:00:10,166 --> 01:00:12,625
There were 3 guys here. Now 4 guys.

846
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:16,125
One more drug addict. Come on. Let's enquire them.

847
01:00:16,625 --> 01:00:19,208
Take it. Bring our stuff.

848
01:00:19,708 --> 01:00:23,208
Why do you watch? Run away. Escape.

849
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,458
I don't trust the ruling Government.

850
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:32,000
I'm not a greedy person too.

851
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:36,208
I've left the party for this. I requested our high command.

852
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:40,458
Our leaders and ministers are involved in the crimes.

853
01:00:40,958 --> 01:00:42,750
But they didn't heed my words.

854
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:46,750
What can I do? Without any party support...

855
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:48,708
A thug can't continue his rowdism.

856
01:00:49,208 --> 01:00:52,291
They can't spread the drugs in our city.

857
01:00:52,791 --> 01:00:54,583
I'm telling this matter frankly today.

858
01:00:55,083 --> 01:00:57,041
Because I don't fear for anybody.

859
01:00:57,541 --> 01:01:02,375
Narayan Dutt Agarwal like ministers are involved in crimes.

860
01:01:02,875 --> 01:01:07,166
Zafar! Politics is a dangerous thing.

861
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:15,083
Nobody is permanent here. He was supporting me.

862
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:19,500
Zafar! If I lose my post by him...

863
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:23,500
He will die before that.

864
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:55,125
Get up!

865
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,875
Dongiri! Is that you?

866
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:05,000
My name is Zafar Dongiri.

867
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:06,250
Do you threaten me?

868
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:07,833
What did you say in T.V?

869
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:10,333
I'll expose you.

870
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:14,333
I'll expose you in the public.

871
01:02:14,833 --> 01:02:17,458
I won't fear for anybody including NDA.

872
01:02:17,958 --> 01:02:21,458
No. - Will you expose me?

873
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:28,791
Greetings!

874
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:31,416
We're standing in Patil sir's house now.

875
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:34,208
He had been murdered cruelly last night.

876
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:38,666
It's not a natural death. It's a planned murder.

877
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:41,500
It's the same party against whom he gave comment.

878
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,875
He had planned to reveal some more things in 2 days.

879
01:02:44,375 --> 01:02:46,416
Is NDA the cause of Patil's murder?

880
01:02:46,916 --> 01:02:48,166
Or... Did anybody else involve in this?

881
01:02:48,666 --> 01:02:51,500
ACP has come to Moukaye Vardad.

882
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,333
Let's ask about the murderer to ACP Saavan.

883
01:02:55,833 --> 01:02:58,500
ACP sir! Who is the cause of this murder?

884
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,625
Listen! we're doing our duty.

885
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:06,041
Law is so powerful. We'll reach the murderer soon.

886
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:07,541
Whom do you suspect?

887
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,458
Ma'am! Our doubt is clear.

888
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:11,750
But we'd not say that now.

889
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:16,041
Okay. ACP Saavan told that law is powerful.

890
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:18,750
Come on. Let's see the power of our law.

891
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:22,750
I'm Tanikasha. News India with camera man Sudheep.

892
01:03:34,333 --> 01:03:35,625
Congratulations, minister.

893
01:03:36,125 --> 01:03:39,208
Our leader has passed away secretly.

894
01:03:39,708 --> 01:03:43,208
This is our leader's talent. He's great.

895
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:02,166
Welcome, Saavan.

896
01:04:02,666 --> 01:04:04,500
You've come at correct time.

897
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,916
Take sweet. What did they plan against me?

898
01:04:10,416 --> 01:04:13,208
I've defeated that.

899
01:04:13,708 --> 01:04:15,541
You take sweet, sir.

900
01:04:16,041 --> 01:04:20,500
Because you've won without going to court.

901
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:26,375
It's our bad luck. No leader had got punished until now.

902
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:30,375
Anyway... I'll reach Patil's murderer definitely.

903
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:48,166
Make it fast. Because you'd not move up.

904
01:04:48,666 --> 01:04:51,291
I mean you'd not get promoted.

905
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:55,291
You're doing good. You must be promoted. Right?

906
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,250
I've broken this only now.

907
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,416
Commissioner Khan! - Sir!

908
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:27,916
Sorry. I didn't notice you.

909
01:06:28,416 --> 01:06:31,541
This is the cause for my arrival here.

910
01:06:32,041 --> 01:06:33,583
Tell me. What should I do for you?

911
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:40,041
Your officer Saavan is so arrogant.

912
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:43,375
I had excused him many times.

913
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,666
He had ignored my words every time.

914
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:49,166
But the situation is so critical now.

915
01:06:49,666 --> 01:06:50,666
Just advice him.

916
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:54,791
Or I'll transfer him to Naksalites area.

917
01:06:55,291 --> 01:06:58,791
His anger will go out automatically. - Minister!

918
01:06:59,291 --> 01:07:04,375
I heard that he's a true and honest officer.

919
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:07,083
He will never change his character.

920
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:10,916
Commissioner Khan! If he doesn't get changed...

921
01:07:11,416 --> 01:07:13,625
I will change him, then.

922
01:07:14,125 --> 01:07:18,333
NDA! I'm Narayan Dutt Agarwal.

923
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,208
The public is there in my side.

924
01:07:20,708 --> 01:07:25,416
He'll be vanished completely.

925
01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:28,000
He was an in charge in this Mumbai.

926
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,958
Minister sir! Don't be angry.

927
01:07:31,458 --> 01:07:33,041
Anger is unhealthy for you.

928
01:07:33,541 --> 01:07:35,166
Why are you angry?

929
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,583
I can't even digest this.

930
01:07:38,083 --> 01:07:39,541
If they don't respect their higher officials!

931
01:07:40,041 --> 01:07:42,250
I'll call him and warn him.

932
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:44,875
Thank you, commissioner Khan.

933
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:47,250
I trust you.

934
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:49,333
Jaihind!

935
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:52,791
Jaihind!

936
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:56,041
Sir! - Do you want to say something to defend you?

937
01:07:56,541 --> 01:08:01,041
Sir! I had sworn and worn this uniform.

938
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:03,583
As I would do my duty honestly.

939
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,791
Whoever comes in between my duty and work...

940
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,125
I would not leave him.

941
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:11,666
Minister has interfered on my way.

942
01:08:12,166 --> 01:08:13,875
Tell me, sir. What should I do?

943
01:08:14,375 --> 01:08:18,625
Do you think that minister is united with criminals?

944
01:08:19,125 --> 01:08:21,000
Sir! I have enough evidence for that.

945
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:28,875
Political leaders also involved in this crime.

946
01:08:29,375 --> 01:08:31,416
When I arrested young girls and guys in party...

947
01:08:31,916 --> 01:08:36,500
I had received minister's call only first.

948
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,875
That's why he might have complained about me to you.

949
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:43,541
Tell me, sir. What should I do?

950
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:56,625
These drugs items have destroyed our youngsters.

951
01:08:57,125 --> 01:09:01,166
It's spoiled our next generation completely.

952
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:06,500
You'd destroy these drug dealers completely.

953
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,458
Can you do this?

954
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:09,375
Yes, sir.

955
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:13,500
You can go.

956
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:17,041
If my higher officials dominate me...

957
01:09:17,541 --> 01:09:19,208
...and if I give a pressure to you...

958
01:09:19,708 --> 01:09:25,125
Don't mind my pressure and avoid it.

959
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:28,708
Right? - Honest senior police officers like you...

960
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:33,250
If you people support junior police officers...

961
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:35,333
I'm telling the truth, sir.

962
01:09:35,833 --> 01:09:37,333
I'll destroy this dirty crime.

963
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:41,333
All the best!

964
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:45,125
Whose house is this?

965
01:09:45,625 --> 01:09:49,833
This is my house. What's your name? - Ajith!

966
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:53,833
Come on. Take your seat.

967
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:04,708
Not on the floor. Sit on the sofa.

968
01:10:05,208 --> 01:10:08,416
Are you alone here?

969
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:12,875
Yes. I'm alone in this house.

970
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:17,291
People had made us orphans.

971
01:10:17,791 --> 01:10:20,791
Otherwise we also would have become a family.

972
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:22,625
I want to know this only.

973
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:27,750
It's true. I've heard this word after a long period.

974
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,500
House...!

975
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:39,250
Drugs, paper and plastic pipe are our life now.

976
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:42,708
This brown sugar will stay with us lifelong.

977
01:10:43,208 --> 01:10:45,791
We'll take it until we die.

978
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:50,125
Vow! Minister! How is it? - Wonderful!

979
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:52,291
Not a stranger, Dongiri.

980
01:10:52,791 --> 01:10:58,041
Patil's servant gave his statement to Magistrate.

981
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:01,916
Okay. Don't worry.

982
01:11:02,416 --> 01:11:04,458
You honour me. I'll save you. Okay?

983
01:11:04,958 --> 01:11:07,500
Servant won't give his statement.

984
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:08,875
Let me move.

985
01:11:09,375 --> 01:11:12,875
Greetings!

986
01:11:35,458 --> 01:11:38,500
Dad! I'd like to know this from you.

987
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:43,041
Are you doing crimes in the name of social service?

988
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:46,166
Divya!

989
01:11:46,666 --> 01:11:48,666
Are you crazy?

990
01:11:49,166 --> 01:11:51,333
Have you turned as mad?

991
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:54,208
You're talking like this to your dad.

992
01:11:54,708 --> 01:11:57,625
This is the result of having bad friendship.

993
01:11:58,125 --> 01:12:00,250
Daddy. Please.

994
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:03,791
You're saying Jeeth as a bad guy.

995
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:11,000
He's the son of social worker Anand Kalsiwal.

996
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:14,125
Zafar Dongiri had killed him.

997
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:16,583
I would like to ask this to you.

998
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,875
What's your relationship with Zafar Dongiri?

999
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:22,583
Why does he come to our home?

1000
01:12:23,083 --> 01:12:25,791
Dear! Your dad is doing social service.

1001
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:33,541
I'm a leader. Leader's house and temple are the same.

1002
01:12:34,041 --> 01:12:37,208
Their doors will be opened for others always.

1003
01:12:37,708 --> 01:12:43,708
How can we restrict certain people here?

1004
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:46,583
You leave this matter.

1005
01:12:47,083 --> 01:12:50,500
Concentrate on your studies.

1006
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,500
Be happy. Go.

1007
01:13:03,666 --> 01:13:06,500
Jeeth!

1008
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:12,166
Anand Kalsiwal's son.

1009
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:18,875
He's washed my daughter's brain.

1010
01:13:19,375 --> 01:13:22,875
Dongiri!

1011
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:29,750
Brother! Minister's call.

1012
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:33,875
Zafar! - Tell me, minister.

1013
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:36,666
A bad news.

1014
01:13:37,166 --> 01:13:38,833
Do you know Anand Kalsiwal?

1015
01:13:39,333 --> 01:13:46,291
No. - Anand Kalsiwal's son is Divya's friend.

1016
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:49,750
He visits our house frequently.

1017
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:53,750
He had seen you in my home on that day.

1018
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:57,458
He had identified you.

1019
01:13:57,958 --> 01:13:59,208
I'll mail you his photo.

1020
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:02,541
Along with his details. You'd finish the work.

1021
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:08,250
Did you understand your duty? - Yes.

1022
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:12,250
Hey! - Understood, boss.

1023
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:25,500
Jeeth Kalsiwal. Hurry up! I remind my hunt.

1024
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,750
Allow me to speak. - Okay.

1025
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:34,791
Who tells that there is no hole in the sky?

1026
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:37,958
Try to throw a stone from the earth.

1027
01:14:38,458 --> 01:14:41,208
Wonderful poem! - Thank you.

1028
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:47,333
This was your dad's favourite hunt.

1029
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:51,125
Do you love your dad so much?

1030
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:53,791
I read in your face book account.

1031
01:14:54,291 --> 01:15:01,291
I love you, papa. I miss you, papa.

1032
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:03,583
I'll send you also to him.

1033
01:15:04,083 --> 01:15:06,250
I won't let you miss him anymore.

1034
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:11,041
Who is Divya? She also is missing you a lot.

1035
01:15:11,541 --> 01:15:18,458
I read that also. I love you, Divya. I miss you, baby.

1036
01:15:18,958 --> 01:15:22,791
But Jeeth! Keep a thing in mind.

1037
01:15:23,291 --> 01:15:27,166
Nobody is great than our parents.

1038
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:32,458
Leave Divya and go to your parents.

1039
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:38,541
They will also handle Divya. Right?

1040
01:15:39,041 --> 01:15:40,541
Are you angry?

1041
01:15:41,041 --> 01:15:48,625
Do you want to know about your dad's death?

1042
01:15:49,125 --> 01:15:50,083
Hey! What did I say?

1043
01:15:50,583 --> 01:15:54,500
What? - It's very late. You didn't tell a game.

1044
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,250
Yes. Nagas had an opportunity to murder last time.

1045
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:58,791
What about him, whom did you murder last time?

1046
01:15:59,291 --> 01:16:01,125
I swear on god. Batle only had killed him.

1047
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:05,791
Please give me a chance. - Okay. Take him.

1048
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:07,625
Thanks a lot, boss.

1049
01:16:08,125 --> 01:16:09,166
Come on.

1050
01:16:09,666 --> 01:16:10,083
Come on.

1051
01:16:10,583 --> 01:16:11,708
Come patiently. Sit down.

1052
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:14,500
Don't be tensed. I won't do you anything.

1053
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,166
Tell me. What do you like to have?

1054
01:16:16,666 --> 01:16:19,416
No thanks. - Shall I get you spicy rice?

1055
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:24,166
No. - Take it. You're wounded.

1056
01:16:24,666 --> 01:16:29,083
We'll feed our goats while sacrificing them.

1057
01:16:29,583 --> 01:16:30,500
That's why I'm offering you too.

1058
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,333
Tell me. What do you like to have? - See!

1059
01:16:32,833 --> 01:16:35,291
Your behaviour is not good.

1060
01:16:35,791 --> 01:16:37,708
Do you show me your finger?

1061
01:16:38,208 --> 01:16:45,833
Idiot! I'm so rough. Do you show me your finger?

1062
01:16:46,333 --> 01:16:48,416
Do you show me your finger?

1063
01:16:48,916 --> 01:16:53,083
Leave me, please.

1064
01:16:53,583 --> 01:16:55,500
Are you crazy?

1065
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:56,916
Why will I make them to murder Jeeth?

1066
01:16:57,416 --> 01:16:59,208
Because he was the direct eye witness.

1067
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:03,500
He had seen your relationship with Dongiri.

1068
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:05,500
What a father you're?

1069
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,916
You've burnt your only daughter's happiness.

1070
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,583
But I won't keep quiet.

1071
01:17:12,083 --> 01:17:14,333
Until I get the severe punishment to Jeeth's murderer...

1072
01:17:14,833 --> 01:17:19,083
I won't be quiet. I'll go to any level for him.

1073
01:17:19,583 --> 01:17:22,958
Divya!

1074
01:17:23,458 --> 01:17:26,958
Divya!

1075
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:32,958
I want to know this. How did you get drugs?

1076
01:17:33,458 --> 01:17:36,541
Who is responsible for this?

1077
01:17:37,041 --> 01:17:40,458
Why did you adopt this poison?

1078
01:17:40,958 --> 01:17:45,625
Rina! You can tell me something definitely.

1079
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:49,875
Answer me.

1080
01:17:50,375 --> 01:17:53,083
Let me share your pain.

1081
01:17:53,583 --> 01:17:58,083
Who can share my pain?

1082
01:17:58,583 --> 01:18:00,708
Listen! He wants to hear our story.

1083
01:18:01,208 --> 01:18:01,750
Shall I tell him?

1084
01:18:02,250 --> 01:18:05,166
Tell him I say.

1085
01:18:05,666 --> 01:18:07,416
I don't understand anything after studying well.

1086
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:08,708
What can I do now? - Tell me, dude.

1087
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:10,791
What can I do? - Hey! Hi, guys!

1088
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:12,916
How are you? - I'm fine.

1089
01:18:13,416 --> 01:18:15,750
So... How are you?

1090
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:18,666
What can I do? I'd prepare it throughout the night.

1091
01:18:19,166 --> 01:18:22,500
I'm doing it throughout the night. She has come.

1092
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,458
Okay. - Bye!

1093
01:18:27,958 --> 01:18:30,458
So... Why don't you even look at me?

1094
01:18:30,958 --> 01:18:32,791
Why do you wear such dresses?

1095
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:36,708
This is so good. - What's this?

1096
01:18:37,208 --> 01:18:39,750
This is only for you.

1097
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:43,750
What's your roll number? - 9!

1098
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:47,500
I'm 10. And seat number. - I know that you're 10.

1099
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,000
Won't you leave me at all?

1100
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:53,000
Of course. I won't leave you until I marry you.

1101
01:18:58,083 --> 01:19:00,166
You leave now. My mind will be corrupted.

1102
01:19:00,666 --> 01:19:03,541
I'll do wrong. - Why will your mind get corrupted?

1103
01:19:04,041 --> 01:19:06,000
You're... - Why don't you concentrate on studies?

1104
01:19:06,500 --> 01:19:08,083
I have to prepare for my exams. You go now.

1105
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:12,708
What's that? Tell me.

1106
01:19:13,208 --> 01:19:14,000
Give me a missed call afterwards.

1107
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:21,958
I won't give. You're showing your temper.

1108
01:19:22,458 --> 01:19:26,666
I'm leaving. My dad is waiting for me in home.

1109
01:19:27,166 --> 01:19:30,500
Anyway... Best of luck.

1110
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,500
Bye!

1111
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:34,833
Do you take my file to your home?

1112
01:19:35,333 --> 01:19:36,291
Bye!

1113
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:40,291
Give me a missed call after reaching home.

1114
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:17,125
Can I join with you? - With pleasure.

1115
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:25,125
Come on. Get in I say. Please come.

1116
01:20:25,625 --> 01:20:29,541
Come on. Sit down.

1117
01:20:30,041 --> 01:20:39,541
We're not selfish. You'll also help us in future.

1118
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:43,541
What does he say? - What?

1119
01:20:50,708 --> 01:20:53,583
Hey! Stop the car. Where do you go?

1120
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:56,250
Tell me. What's your next plan?

1121
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:59,500
I'll become a doctor after completing M.B.B.S course.

1122
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,833
When did you plan to become a doctor?

1123
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:05,833
Hey! Watch there. Move away.

1124
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:14,000
Why are you tensed? - Why are you tensed?

1125
01:21:14,500 --> 01:21:18,000
Hey! Stop it.

1126
01:21:24,041 --> 01:21:24,500
Come out I say.

1127
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:33,333
Come out. - Should I invite you personally?

1128
01:21:33,833 --> 01:21:35,458
Come out I say.

1129
01:21:35,958 --> 01:21:37,625
Sir! - I'll tell you about your crime.

1130
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:43,375
Sir! We're guiltless. - I know your innocence.

1131
01:21:43,875 --> 01:21:45,750
Check the car.

1132
01:21:46,250 --> 01:21:49,541
Sir! Nothing is there. - Why do you repeat this always?

1133
01:21:50,041 --> 01:21:54,125
Check the car. - Bring that here. What's that?

1134
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:56,666
It's a strange thing. - What's this?

1135
01:21:57,166 --> 01:22:00,625
Sir! It's nothing. I...

1136
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:04,625
What's it?

1137
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:11,416
What's it? - I don't know. I'm a medical student.

1138
01:22:11,916 --> 01:22:12,375
If you don't believe me...

1139
01:22:12,875 --> 01:22:14,208
You can ask my sir Mr. Sharma.

1140
01:22:14,708 --> 01:22:16,500
Do you cheat me? Are you a medical student?

1141
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,500
Come on. Get inside.

1142
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:43,500
Tell me. Who are involved in this drug smuggling?

1143
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,625
Where do you supply these drugs?

1144
01:22:46,125 --> 01:22:48,083
I'm a medical student.

1145
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:52,083
They only gave me a lift. Is this my fault?

1146
01:22:55,875 --> 01:22:58,708
How many times I'd tell you that I don't know them?

1147
01:22:59,208 --> 01:23:01,708
Why don't you try to understand me?

1148
01:23:02,208 --> 01:23:03,125
I'm a medical student.

1149
01:23:03,625 --> 01:23:08,916
Literates only are involved in terrorist activities now.

1150
01:23:09,416 --> 01:23:11,583
Civil engineers, doctors, teachers...

1151
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:17,041
Literates only are destroying the public frequently.

1152
01:23:17,541 --> 01:23:20,916
Trained pilot only attacked the world trade center.

1153
01:23:21,416 --> 01:23:23,041
This is a new phase of terrorism.

1154
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:24,500
What are you saying?

1155
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,041
Is it the new phase of terrorism?

1156
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:29,000
Am I looking like a terrorist to you?

1157
01:23:29,500 --> 01:23:31,375
How many times I'd tell you that I'm not a terrorist?

1158
01:23:31,875 --> 01:23:33,416
This is my fault. They gave me a lift.

1159
01:23:33,916 --> 01:23:34,500
I don't even know them.

1160
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,625
What are they doing? They stay nearby my area.

1161
01:23:40,125 --> 01:23:41,500
You're telling me a terrorist.

1162
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,500
You can say these in the court.

1163
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,125
Court will decide the judgment.

1164
01:23:47,625 --> 01:23:49,500
What will the court do?

1165
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,500
I'm not guilty. What will the court do me?

1166
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,416
I'm a medical student and an educated person.

1167
01:23:56,916 --> 01:23:58,625
New phase of terrorism.

1168
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:01,000
What do you want to say?

1169
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:02,166
New phase of terrorism.

1170
01:24:02,666 --> 01:24:06,541
Do you think that I'm a terrorist?

1171
01:24:07,041 --> 01:24:09,208
New phase of terrorism.

1172
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:11,083
You please check my degree.

1173
01:24:11,583 --> 01:24:15,083
You'll understand my qualification, then.

1174
01:24:18,333 --> 01:24:21,541
I'll show you my identity card. You have my mobile.

1175
01:24:22,041 --> 01:24:24,125
Why don't you check its numbers?

1176
01:24:24,625 --> 01:24:26,541
You please contact them.

1177
01:24:27,041 --> 01:24:28,916
New phase of terrorism.

1178
01:24:29,416 --> 01:24:33,000
You'd understand before speaking.

1179
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:40,500
You say a decent guy as a terrorist.

1180
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,208
You can put an allegation on anybody.

1181
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:45,750
I'm not the terrorist. - Where's my son?

1182
01:24:46,250 --> 01:24:48,833
You're spoiling my life. - Where is my son?

1183
01:24:49,333 --> 01:24:54,416
I heart that you'd destroy us in the name of terrorist.

1184
01:24:54,916 --> 01:24:57,208
You say a decent guy as a terrorist. - Inspector!

1185
01:24:57,708 --> 01:24:58,708
Why did you arrest my son?

1186
01:24:59,208 --> 01:24:59,875
Who are you?

1187
01:25:00,375 --> 01:25:01,250
Whom do you want to meet?

1188
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:03,625
Sir! I'm Lateef's sister.

1189
01:25:04,125 --> 01:25:05,458
She's our mother.

1190
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:07,166
You're not allowed to meet him.

1191
01:25:07,666 --> 01:25:09,458
He's an accused. A serious charge is there on him.

1192
01:25:09,958 --> 01:25:13,041
No. You might have got a wrong information.

1193
01:25:13,541 --> 01:25:14,583
My brother won't be an accused.

1194
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:15,875
What do you think?

1195
01:25:16,375 --> 01:25:18,083
Am I lying?

1196
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:20,916
I had caught him with drugs.

1197
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:22,291
He's supplying drugs.

1198
01:25:22,791 --> 01:25:23,916
My brother can't do this.

1199
01:25:24,416 --> 01:25:26,833
Which person hates the intoxication!

1200
01:25:27,333 --> 01:25:28,375
How can he supply drugs, sir?

1201
01:25:28,875 --> 01:25:31,166
Relatives of all the accused say this only.

1202
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:33,000
Because they don't know their inner face.

1203
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:35,666
Sir! My mom is a heart patient.

1204
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:38,083
She's come to meet Lateef.

1205
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:42,083
Please allow her to meet Lateef brother only once.

1206
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:49,291
You can meet him. But not here.

1207
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:51,333
In the court!

1208
01:25:51,833 --> 01:25:58,291
Court only will decide the judgment.

1209
01:25:58,791 --> 01:26:01,916
Mom! What happened to you?

1210
01:26:02,416 --> 01:26:05,500
Lateef! - Mom! Come on. - My son!

1211
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:12,500
We can meet him later on. - Lateef!

1212
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,125
After listening to the statement of eye witness...

1213
01:26:16,625 --> 01:26:18,833
Court has come to this conclusion.

1214
01:26:19,333 --> 01:26:25,750
Lateef has been related with drug suppliers.

1215
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:29,750
So this court grants 7 years of imprisonment to Lateef.

1216
01:26:37,458 --> 01:26:42,208
I'd not meet my mom even once, when she was alive.

1217
01:26:42,708 --> 01:26:46,041
I was scared. I had seen my mom's face everywhere.

1218
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:50,541
It was strange for me.

1219
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:57,500
I saw my mom's face. She had left me permanently.

1220
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:01,458
I was praying for her into the prison.

1221
01:27:01,958 --> 01:27:04,833
When I was praying for her on a night...

1222
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:12,500
Policemen had taken me to graveyard in their jeep.

1223
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,750
I came to know my mom's death news there.

1224
01:27:19,250 --> 01:27:22,750
My mom had passed away.

1225
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,333
Everybody had seen me with hatred.

1226
01:27:29,833 --> 01:27:37,541
As I did a great crime.

1227
01:27:38,041 --> 01:27:43,333
I had passed my days in jail after that.

1228
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:46,833
I had been released after my imprisonment period.

1229
01:27:47,333 --> 01:27:48,875
After coming out of the jail..

1230
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:52,916
I went to my girl friend first.

1231
01:27:53,416 --> 01:27:56,916
She became a flower of some other garden.

1232
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:26,125
Hey beauty! I want to tell you something.

1233
01:28:26,625 --> 01:28:29,833
Your feet are so beautiful.

1234
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:32,291
Don't keep them on the ground.

1235
01:28:32,791 --> 01:28:33,916
Ground will become an insignificant thing.

1236
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:35,083
Understand?

1237
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:37,166
Vow! What an intelligence!

1238
01:28:37,666 --> 01:28:41,250
Come on. Why don't you come?

1239
01:28:41,750 --> 01:28:52,625
'These people...' - Where did he go?

1240
01:28:53,125 --> 01:28:53,833
What happened?

1241
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:56,958
I thought that he had enjoyed inside really.

1242
01:28:57,458 --> 01:28:58,833
He's taken away my money.

1243
01:28:59,333 --> 01:29:00,250
Scoundrel!

1244
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:01,666
He left through this way. - This way?

1245
01:29:02,166 --> 01:29:03,750
I'll punish him now.

1246
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:09,208
'These guys have taken my shawl!' - Come here.

1247
01:29:09,708 --> 01:29:15,708
'These guys have taken my shawl!'

1248
01:29:16,208 --> 01:29:19,708
Hey! What?

1249
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:27,208
What, handsome guy?

1250
01:29:27,708 --> 01:29:29,666
Why do you watch us like a policeman?

1251
01:29:30,166 --> 01:29:32,958
No. That's... - What's it?

1252
01:29:33,458 --> 01:29:40,166
I've come for a friend. - Go there and ask.

1253
01:29:40,666 --> 01:29:44,166
Go I say.

1254
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,250
Don't you know? We'll charge for sighting us too.

1255
01:29:49,750 --> 01:29:50,166
What do you want?

1256
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:52,416
Tell me. What do you want?

1257
01:29:52,916 --> 01:29:55,000
I'd do second work.

1258
01:29:55,500 --> 01:29:59,750
Second work? Do you watch English picture?

1259
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:03,416
It won't be done here. Go to 3rd street.

1260
01:30:03,916 --> 01:30:05,250
No. I didn't mean that.

1261
01:30:05,750 --> 01:30:09,666
My name is Lateef. - Lateef!

1262
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:15,500
I have a friend. Her name is Nargiz. - Nargiz!

1263
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,375
What name did you say?

1264
01:30:17,875 --> 01:30:21,625
My name is Lateef. - You wait here.

1265
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:25,625
I'll come now.

1266
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:37,291
Lateef has come there.

1267
01:30:37,791 --> 01:30:41,291
Is he that guy about whom you told me?

1268
01:30:45,958 --> 01:30:49,250
How did you find that he's that guy?

1269
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:52,458
If I see his behaviour, I feel that he's Lateef.

1270
01:30:52,958 --> 01:30:56,458
He's told his name also as Lateef.

1271
01:30:58,041 --> 01:31:00,000
What can you do now?

1272
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:04,000
If you say, I'll send him inside.

1273
01:31:09,250 --> 01:31:12,916
Tell him that I'm not here.

1274
01:31:13,416 --> 01:31:17,000
He's already broken. I won't hurt him much.

1275
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:21,000
You tell him directly. I'll send him inside.

1276
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:34,000
Okay. Send him inside.

1277
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:38,500
Okay. Let me send him inside.

1278
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,500
Go. She's calling you inside.

1279
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:48,583
Shall I go? - Yeah.

1280
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:57,083
What's the matter? Tell me.

1281
01:31:57,583 --> 01:32:00,583
What's the time limit?

1282
01:32:01,083 --> 01:32:04,500
Rs.500 for an hour and Rs.1000 for 2 hours.

1283
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,583
What? - Didn't you hear my words?

1284
01:32:08,083 --> 01:32:11,166
Rs.500 for an hour and Rs.1000 for 2 hours.

1285
01:32:11,666 --> 01:32:14,166
And Rs.5000 for a full night.

1286
01:32:14,666 --> 01:32:16,250
Tell me. Do you have money?

1287
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:17,750
Give me or leave away.

1288
01:32:18,250 --> 01:32:21,750
Get lost!

1289
01:32:24,166 --> 01:32:26,666
'I could not forget her.'

1290
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:28,250
'I had been disappointed there.'

1291
01:32:28,750 --> 01:32:41,250
"Dude! Look at me. Moon and stars are here.'

1292
01:32:41,750 --> 01:32:44,166
What happened?

1293
01:32:44,666 --> 01:32:45,250
What's wrong with you?

1294
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:49,750
Did she accept you or not?

1295
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:53,750
Why don't you tell me anything?

1296
01:32:54,250 --> 01:33:04,333
"I'm walking in a strange path."

1297
01:33:04,833 --> 01:33:10,500
"It's changed my fate."

1298
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,333
"It's changed my fate."

1299
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:20,750
"It's changed my fate."

1300
01:33:21,250 --> 01:33:25,250
"It's changed my fate."

1301
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:30,166
"It's changed my fate."

1302
01:33:30,666 --> 01:33:35,625
I love her so deeply.

1303
01:33:36,125 --> 01:33:38,208
I just remember a thing.

1304
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:44,416
To forget my grief and to escape from people's hatred.

1305
01:33:44,916 --> 01:33:51,250
I adopted this brown sugar to forget my pain.

1306
01:33:51,750 --> 01:33:55,250
Brown sugar!

1307
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:04,916
How is my story? You liar!

1308
01:34:21,125 --> 01:34:26,125
"What did my fate do?"

1309
01:34:26,625 --> 01:34:30,125
Everything was fake.

1310
01:34:37,375 --> 01:34:39,750
Your past experience is so bad.

1311
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:42,708
That's why you've gone in a wrong path.

1312
01:34:43,208 --> 01:34:45,000
Can I have some water? - Why not?

1313
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:49,000
Just a minute.

1314
01:35:21,125 --> 01:35:24,250
Don't get scared, friends.

1315
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,250
Have it.

1316
01:35:25,750 --> 01:35:27,625
Drink water.

1317
01:35:28,125 --> 01:35:29,458
I don't want to arrest you people.

1318
01:35:29,958 --> 01:35:33,416
I want to arrest them, who made you drug addicts.

1319
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:37,333
By the way... I can't redeem your past life.

1320
01:35:37,833 --> 01:35:40,541
But I'll discuss with my senior regarding you people.

1321
01:35:41,041 --> 01:35:45,083
Let's try for a new dawn in future.

1322
01:35:45,583 --> 01:35:47,500
You people can have a second life.

1323
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,250
It's impossible. - Possible. - No.

1324
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:51,958
It's possible, Lateef.

1325
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:55,958
It's a condition. You'd not consume any drug further.

1326
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,041
Thank you, Lateef.

1327
01:36:13,541 --> 01:36:14,458
Sit down!

1328
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:22,375
We've practised this. We can't be alive without this.

1329
01:36:22,875 --> 01:36:23,958
Give me your brown sugar packs, Rina.

1330
01:36:24,458 --> 01:36:28,291
Give me completely. - Lateef! You also give me.

1331
01:36:28,791 --> 01:36:30,125
Give me all the packs.

1332
01:36:30,625 --> 01:36:34,541
Look. I'm telling you with love.

1333
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:40,083
Give me fully. Don't you know police tortures?

1334
01:36:40,583 --> 01:36:42,208
Don't be adamant. You also give me, Lateef.

1335
01:36:42,708 --> 01:36:46,208
I still have some.

1336
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:55,416
Give it to me. Ajith! I've told you. Right?

1337
01:36:55,916 --> 01:36:58,458
I say you'd not consume any drug further.

1338
01:36:58,958 --> 01:37:02,458
Addiction on drugs? - I promise you.

1339
01:37:05,166 --> 01:37:10,500
Listen to me. I'll meet commissioner sir.

1340
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,041
You can take bath and eat food at that time.

1341
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:17,041
Okay?

1342
01:37:28,166 --> 01:37:35,458
My condition is bad. - I'll die without drugs.

1343
01:37:35,958 --> 01:37:38,500
I'll die without drugs. What can I do?

1344
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:45,500
We can get it now. Until ACP sir comes here...

1345
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,041
We must be here.

1346
01:37:48,541 --> 01:37:55,083
The next way is... Come on from here.

1347
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:59,083
Come on I say.

1348
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Kulkarni! If they had escaped, no problem.

1349
01:38:10,500 --> 01:38:12,750
Search them and bring them to me.

1350
01:38:13,250 --> 01:38:16,250
Okay? - Sir! - Go. - Yes, sir.

1351
01:38:16,750 --> 01:38:20,333
Sir! Mukbir Ali, M.L.A. Patil...

1352
01:38:20,833 --> 01:38:23,750
His servant and Jeeth Kalsiwal...

1353
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:27,000
Informers, who gave us informations about drug business.

1354
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:28,666
Whoever had been murdered.

1355
01:38:29,166 --> 01:38:32,416
They were against N.D.Agarwal and Dongiri.

1356
01:38:32,916 --> 01:38:39,083
It means Narayan Dutt Agarwal is the main accused.

1357
01:38:39,583 --> 01:38:42,166
Sir! Please permit me to arrest him.

1358
01:38:42,666 --> 01:38:47,583
Look, Saavan. N.D.A is a powerful minister.

1359
01:38:48,083 --> 01:38:50,666
We'd arrest with proper evidences.

1360
01:38:51,166 --> 01:38:54,333
Otherwise we and our job will be gone.

1361
01:38:54,833 --> 01:38:56,833
I don't bother about my job, sir.

1362
01:38:57,333 --> 01:38:58,250
I'm worried about our country.

1363
01:38:58,750 --> 01:39:00,541
And our country's youngsters.

1364
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:02,500
Sir! I promise you.

1365
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:03,708
Within 24 hours.

1366
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:07,166
I'll come to you to ask arrest warrant against N.D.A.

1367
01:39:07,666 --> 01:39:09,250
Or I'll come to give you my resignation letter.

1368
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:11,750
I don't want your resignation letter.

1369
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:13,750
I want to protect your job.

1370
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:19,958
You'll get his arrest warrant order by tomorrow morning.

1371
01:39:20,458 --> 01:39:21,208
Right? - Thank you, sir.

1372
01:39:21,708 --> 01:39:22,375
You can go.

1373
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:26,375
Thanks. - All the best.

1374
01:39:44,625 --> 01:39:48,125
Pandey! - Yes, sir.

1375
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,833
Look at this. Real Kolapuri weapon.

1376
01:39:57,333 --> 01:40:00,416
It'll finish everybody's life.

1377
01:40:00,916 --> 01:40:03,166
Have it.

1378
01:40:03,666 --> 01:40:06,500
Understood? - Understood, sir.

1379
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Look at this. Ganpat!

1380
01:40:10,500 --> 01:40:11,500
Remove his pant.

1381
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:13,500
I'll remove it and make him naked now.

1382
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,500
Sir! I'll tell you everything.

1383
01:40:23,416 --> 01:40:24,500
Where is Imran?

1384
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:27,583
He's received a call. He's gone to a girl.

1385
01:40:28,083 --> 01:40:29,500
Why did he switch off his mobile?

1386
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,750
Boss! We must switch off our mobile there.

1387
01:40:32,250 --> 01:40:36,750
If our phone rings, how can we enjoy there?

1388
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:40,583
Take it. I spoke about a demon. He's come.

1389
01:40:41,083 --> 01:40:43,083
Where were you? - Dongiri!

1390
01:40:43,583 --> 01:40:44,416
Why don't you speak?

1391
01:40:44,916 --> 01:40:48,416
Boss! I think that she had played his thing.

1392
01:40:54,750 --> 01:41:00,583
You scoundrel! Whom did you bring here?

1393
01:41:01,083 --> 01:41:06,083
Did you join with policemen?

1394
01:41:06,583 --> 01:41:10,083
You'd know the consequence of betraying me.

1395
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:15,666
That only will happen.

1396
01:41:16,166 --> 01:41:19,666
It'll happen, what I agree.

1397
01:41:26,916 --> 01:41:30,416
Take all of them. - Come on.

1398
01:42:00,500 --> 01:42:02,000
Enough. You've done many more things.

1399
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:06,000
Come on.

1400
01:42:08,166 --> 01:42:09,333
Move I say.

1401
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:14,416
ACP Saavan has arrested Zafar with proper evidences.

1402
01:42:14,916 --> 01:42:19,333
He's seized the drug items from the accused place.

1403
01:42:19,833 --> 01:42:23,333
Saavan has told that he'd arrest the main accused soon.

1404
01:42:31,583 --> 01:42:32,500
Saavan! - Yes, sir.

1405
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,916
Start the operation N.D.A.

1406
01:42:35,416 --> 01:42:39,333
Which operation? - Narayan Dutt Agarwal.

1407
01:42:39,833 --> 01:42:42,916
They will make allegations on us.

1408
01:42:43,416 --> 01:42:46,416
This problem won't end in this country.

1409
01:42:46,916 --> 01:42:50,500
People know our India in the name of allegations only.

1410
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:54,500
Did you keep the passport ready? - Yes, sir.

1411
01:42:56,916 --> 01:43:00,500
If any phone call comes, respond under my instruction.

1412
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,166
Okay.

1413
01:43:03,666 --> 01:43:07,833
Come on. - Saavan! Is that you?

1414
01:43:08,333 --> 01:43:09,583
Here now? - Why?

1415
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:15,000
You forgot it. I told that I'd come here again.

1416
01:43:15,500 --> 01:43:17,000
I've come to arrest you now.

1417
01:43:17,500 --> 01:43:22,416
Along with the arrest warrant obediently.

1418
01:43:22,916 --> 01:43:27,583
Under which case? - Divya.

1419
01:43:28,083 --> 01:43:31,583
Is that you? - Under many more cases.

1420
01:43:35,583 --> 01:43:38,916
Anand Kalsiwal's, Jeeth or Patil's case.

1421
01:43:39,416 --> 01:43:46,916
When decent political leaders do such crimes.

1422
01:43:47,416 --> 01:43:49,083
We will suffer a lot at that time.

1423
01:43:49,583 --> 01:43:51,666
It's a good dialogue.

1424
01:43:52,166 --> 01:43:53,500
But... What's the proof for it?

1425
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:57,500
He's that. Your own partner!

1426
01:44:04,583 --> 01:44:07,916
Dongiri!

1427
01:44:08,416 --> 01:44:11,916
Shall we go?

1428
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,500
Please come, sir.

1429
01:44:22,166 --> 01:44:25,250
We're in the entrance of minister N.D.A's house now.

1430
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:28,166
Police ACP Saavan has arrested him here.

1431
01:44:28,666 --> 01:44:33,583
Except spreading drugs in city with Zafar Dongiri.

1432
01:44:34,083 --> 01:44:36,833
Three murder crimes also are there on him.

1433
01:44:37,333 --> 01:44:39,500
Police is enquiring regarding all those cases.

1434
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,083
We'd see this. Whether the public gets justice.

1435
01:44:43,583 --> 01:44:44,000
Or our leader!

1436
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:46,583
I'm Sruthi Sen with camera man Gouthem Singh.

1437
01:44:47,083 --> 01:44:48,083
News India, Mumbai.

1438
01:44:48,583 --> 01:44:50,666
See. Don't worry. We're also searching him.

1439
01:44:51,166 --> 01:44:52,916
We're so serious about this matter.

1440
01:44:53,416 --> 01:45:00,750
Sir! - Sir! Any details about my brother Lateef?

1441
01:45:01,250 --> 01:45:04,250
Ring to Kulkarni.

1442
01:45:04,750 --> 01:45:08,250
Sorry, sir.

1443
01:45:13,041 --> 01:45:16,375
Yes, sir. - Where can we find Lateef now?

1444
01:45:16,875 --> 01:45:19,541
Sir! Near Arab street's garbage bin.

1445
01:45:20,041 --> 01:45:21,916
I had seen those 3 guys there only.

1446
01:45:22,416 --> 01:45:24,750
Okay. We're coming there only. - Okay, sir.

1447
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:27,916
Okay.

1448
01:45:28,416 --> 01:45:31,916
Come on.

1449
01:45:43,125 --> 01:45:52,250
"Our fate had spoiled our dreams completely."

1450
01:45:52,750 --> 01:45:57,208
"Our fate had spoiled our dreams completely."

1451
01:45:57,708 --> 01:46:06,916
"It's changed our fate in this young age itself."

1452
01:46:07,416 --> 01:46:11,791
"It's changed our life totally."

1453
01:46:12,291 --> 01:46:16,708
"It's changed our life totally."

1454
01:46:17,208 --> 01:46:21,583
"It's changed our life totally."

1455
01:46:22,083 --> 01:46:25,583
"It's changed our life totally."

1456
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,500
"He didn't do any crime to regret for it lifelong."

1457
01:46:54,000 --> 01:47:03,125
"I was guiltless. But they made me an accused."

1458
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:12,916
"This world has filled up the hatred in my heart."

1459
01:47:13,416 --> 01:47:18,083
"This world has filled up the hatred in my heart."

1460
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:27,875
"They had pushed us into this deadly life."

1461
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:42,625
"Hey society! You gave us poison to forget our smile."

1462
01:47:43,125 --> 01:47:54,958
"This world has finished us using our bad time."

1463
01:47:55,458 --> 01:48:10,791
"It's changed our fate in this young age itself."

1464
01:48:11,291 --> 01:48:23,750
"I remind my past life once again."

1465
01:48:24,250 --> 01:48:29,500
"The fact has been ended now."

1466
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:34,500
"Their frustration is over now."

1467
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:39,458
"Their frustration is over now."

1468
01:48:39,958 --> 01:48:43,458
"Their frustration is over now."

1469
01:48:50,416 --> 01:48:51,833
I'm Narayan Dutt Agarwal.

1470
01:48:52,333 --> 01:48:53,291
I take this oath.

1471
01:48:53,791 --> 01:48:59,500
I'll concentrate on our country's pride and prestige.

1472
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:01,541
I'll honour our country always.

1473
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:02,708
Jaihind!

1474
01:49:03,208 --> 01:49:04,875
'Hail to India.' - This is our country's bad luck.

1475
01:49:05,375 --> 01:49:08,875
No leader had been punished under any case.

1476
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,750
"We'll forget this whole world in drugs."

1477
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:25,916
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1478
01:49:26,416 --> 01:49:30,250
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1479
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:36,333
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1480
01:49:36,833 --> 01:49:43,500
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1481
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:51,583
"Drug addicts!"

1482
01:49:52,083 --> 01:50:02,000
"Kashmir stuff! Once again."

1483
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:06,500
"Hats off to young guys. Whole world is in this."

1484
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:10,750
"Where else is this happiness except intoxication?"

1485
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:18,750
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1486
01:50:19,250 --> 01:50:25,333
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1487
01:50:25,833 --> 01:50:29,250
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1488
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:36,583
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1489
01:50:37,083 --> 01:50:40,583
"Drug addicts!"

1490
01:50:52,666 --> 01:50:56,666
"We fly on the sky. We're in kick here."

1491
01:50:57,166 --> 01:51:04,833
"If we fall on the earth, we'll be excited."

1492
01:51:05,333 --> 01:51:09,250
"It's an intoxication and we're unconscious."

1493
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:13,500
"We won't be connected with our life."

1494
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:21,625
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1495
01:51:22,125 --> 01:51:26,208
"Hats off, drug addicts."

1496
01:51:26,708 --> 01:51:32,291
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."

1497
01:51:32,791 --> 01:51:39,125
"Drug addicts. We forget this world's pain totally."
