1
00:00:58,752 --> 00:00:59,899
'What's right...'

2
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:01,258
'and what's wrong...'

3
00:01:01,543 --> 00:01:02,706
'I am here...'

4
00:01:03,052 --> 00:01:03,898
'You are here...'

5
00:01:04,204 --> 00:01:05,306
'nothing else matters.'

6
00:01:09,061 --> 00:01:10,961
'Neither is there a desire...'

7
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:13,894
'Nor is there a road to it.'

8
00:01:18,437 --> 00:01:20,188
'Let's immerse ourselves in this'

9
00:01:20,556 --> 00:01:22,749
'Come, let's live.'

10
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:55,918
'Who am I? What am I?'

11
00:01:56,397 --> 00:02:00,099
'Neither did my city know me,
nor my family.'

12
00:02:01,262 --> 00:02:04,295
Mansi liked wearing pants
since the time she was little.

13
00:02:05,315 --> 00:02:08,480
How many time did I tell her dad
to not let Mansi wear pants, but...

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,739
she's the beloved one.

15
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:14,185
One day she started insisting that she
would only go to school wearing pants.

16
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:16,637
And then her father got her pants.

17
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:20,235
Her nursery teacher
still doesn't know...

18
00:02:20,703 --> 00:02:22,722
that Mansi is not a boy,
but a girl.

19
00:02:22,885 --> 00:02:23,554
(Embarrassed laughs)

20
00:02:25,195 --> 00:02:27,258
Sister, would Mr. Dubey be joining us?

21
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:28,867
Yes, he must be on his way.

22
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:36,078
'Now I had decided
what I needed to do!'

23
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,989
'And along with me, someone
else had also made a decision.'

24
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:45,005
Taran, I can't marry you.

25
00:02:46,295 --> 00:02:47,153
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:48,795
Sorry?

27
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,682
Veer, today is our ring ceremony.

28
00:02:52,145 --> 00:02:55,011
And if you hadn't called me for this secret chat,
you would have put the ring on my finger by now.

29
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:55,850
You know that.

30
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:56,782
Let's go?

31
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:01,763
That's exactly why I
didn't put the ring on you.

32
00:03:02,488 --> 00:03:04,343
And needed to have this chat.

33
00:03:07,043 --> 00:03:09,344
You are my oldest friend...

34
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:12,241
and that's why I am telling you this.

35
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:15,727
Veer, don't tell me,
tell this to your father.

36
00:03:20,238 --> 00:03:22,389
I don't have the guts
to tell my father.

37
00:03:23,984 --> 00:03:26,161
Why don't you go out
and tell everyone please?

38
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:31,331
Look Taran, if I marry you today.

39
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,269
it will be very wrong.

40
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,310
And you will never forgive me.

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,443
Sorry.

42
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:22,477
(Song: Who am I...)

43
00:05:56,737 --> 00:05:58,279
Stop. Stop here please.

44
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:01,392
But Nikki, how can you go like this?
You should inform me...

45
00:06:13,467 --> 00:06:15,309
Hi Veer, what a surprise!

46
00:06:15,497 --> 00:06:16,426
Come in...

47
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,642
What is this? Did you
run away from your own wedding?

48
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:23,349
Yes...

49
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:25,597
Something like that.

50
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:28,131
There was a wedding, and...

51
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,389
I had to get the hell out of there
and come to Delhi.

52
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,393
Is Akshay home?

53
00:06:34,473 --> 00:06:36,641
Not yet, he said he will come by 4.

54
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:39,696
Now, you know your
best friend better than me.

55
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:41,562
No, not better than you.

56
00:06:41,888 --> 00:06:43,564
Only you think like that.

57
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:47,061
Okay, you go freshen up and I will get
you a freshly brewed cup of coffee.

58
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:23,256
Hi!

59
00:07:24,147 --> 00:07:27,140
I am Mansi, Nikki's friend.

60
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,333
Oh yeah!

61
00:07:30,651 --> 00:07:32,023
She told me.

62
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:34,847
I mean, she did tell me about you.

63
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:41,334
She told me that
a friend will be coming.

64
00:07:43,187 --> 00:07:46,123
A 'hot' friend, she didn't.

65
00:07:50,056 --> 00:07:50,886
Joint?

66
00:07:51,445 --> 00:07:52,143
No.

67
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:53,687
I don't do drugs.

68
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:55,021
Oh yeah?

69
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,899
So, what do you do?

70
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,559
So, what is it that you 'like' to do?

71
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:06,273
Food.

72
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:08,013
I like food.

73
00:08:09,102 --> 00:08:11,493
Is there anything in
the kitchen that I can eat?

74
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:12,998
Yeah, there is...

75
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:16,851
ME.

76
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:21,486
Have as much as you want.

77
00:08:24,272 --> 00:08:25,562
Sweetheart,

78
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:28,117
Kitchen is on the left.

79
00:08:28,444 --> 00:08:30,007
Self service.

80
00:08:30,087 --> 00:08:33,841
Grab what you get, and eat it.

81
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,357
Go pamper her more...

82
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,698
I had told you

83
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,181
Something is not right somewhere...

84
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,764
She is a girl, raise her like one.

85
00:09:01,004 --> 00:09:02,045
But no...

86
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,899
you said our daughter will wear pants.

87
00:09:08,128 --> 00:09:11,183
Now she ran away in those pants.

88
00:09:14,157 --> 00:09:18,367
Leaving just 4 lines on
a piece of paper for us.

89
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,016
If she had run away for a boy...

90
00:09:41,192 --> 00:09:44,410
at least we would have been
able to show our face in the society.

91
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:52,123
In school, what I tell
my students is a disease...

92
00:09:56,752 --> 00:10:00,087
I didn't even realize that, the same
disease was flowering in my own house.

93
00:13:06,834 --> 00:13:07,938
Listen...

94
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:09,975
Stay here, tonight.

95
00:13:14,841 --> 00:13:16,029
I can't, Akshay.

96
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,337
Please try.

97
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,260
You are making it sound
like I don't want to.

98
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:23,015
I want to stay.

99
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:26,295
So please stay for tonight.

100
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:28,695
Akshay, this is a serious issue.

101
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:31,458
You and I need to
have a chat about this.

102
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:36,435
And with Mitali in the house,
we can't talk about this.

103
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,666
I have run away from my home.

104
00:13:39,123 --> 00:13:40,596
I don't even know what I have packed.

105
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:42,828
My house here is in a mess.

106
00:13:44,347 --> 00:13:45,846
I need to go home.

107
00:13:46,305 --> 00:13:47,844
I will fix up my house.

108
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,549
You come there tomorrow,

109
00:13:49,676 --> 00:13:51,198
and we need to find a solution.

110
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:52,705
No, no, not tomorrow.

111
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:55,368
Tomorrow I am throwing
a party at the club.

112
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,319
Just come there,
we will talk about it.

113
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,478
You will have time for me there?

114
00:14:01,456 --> 00:14:02,467
Of course.

115
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:08,015
- Veer, what do you prefer?
Red or white?

116
00:14:08,702 --> 00:14:09,493
White.

117
00:14:13,042 --> 00:14:16,308
I was telling him that I have
been calling him since morning...

118
00:14:16,474 --> 00:14:18,283
not reachable, unavailable.

119
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,856
not reachable, unavailable.

120
00:14:19,936 --> 00:14:21,186
I got tired of calling him.

121
00:14:21,266 --> 00:14:24,036
That's why I never call him.

122
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:25,865
Cause I always get to hear this,

123
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,816
this man is not
available for your call.

124
00:14:28,388 --> 00:14:30,560
It's not like that,
I was busy at the product launch.

125
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,709
I had told you.

126
00:14:31,882 --> 00:14:33,106
He did tell me.

127
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:36,893
Busy man, products and launches.
Right?

128
00:14:38,332 --> 00:14:40,255
Veer, can I tell you one thing?

129
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:43,768
If you get married,
please don't be like him.

130
00:14:44,573 --> 00:14:46,150
Mitali, I promise you...

131
00:14:46,786 --> 00:14:49,641
I will never be like him.

132
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:51,568
I cannot be like him.

133
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:53,566
If you guys are done,
can we have some food?

134
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:54,828
No, please open this first.

135
00:14:54,908 --> 00:14:56,249
I'll say cheers to that!

136
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,894
Akshay...

137
00:16:26,783 --> 00:16:29,900
Is he really busy?
Or is he acting busy?

138
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:42,017
I guess, he's trying.

139
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:46,873
Veer Pratap Roudhawa.

140
00:16:47,489 --> 00:16:49,918
It's quite a long and a heavy name.

141
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:51,793
I am Mansi.

142
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:54,516
Short and sweet - Mansi.

143
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,906
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Veer.

144
00:16:57,986 --> 00:16:59,735
Nice to meet you, Mansi.

145
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:02,162
So...

146
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,763
what brings you here?

147
00:17:08,514 --> 00:17:09,864
Had to meet you.

148
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:13,137
Seriously?

149
00:17:13,502 --> 00:17:16,800
It's a LGBT party and I am a lesbian.

150
00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:18,851
Isn't that obvious?

151
00:17:19,221 --> 00:17:24,152
Well I must say, that was
a very stupid question on my part.

152
00:17:25,087 --> 00:17:25,857
Sorry.

153
00:17:27,252 --> 00:17:31,134
By the way,
your boyfriend is quite handsome.

154
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:33,960
Very sexy I must say!

155
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:36,393
He is.

156
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,936
Thank you.

157
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:42,496
And yours?

158
00:17:44,288 --> 00:17:46,206
Oh, she's beautiful!

159
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:49,858
As of now, she's is in Mcloed Ganj.

160
00:17:50,478 --> 00:17:52,935
When I ran away from home,
I thought I will surprise her...

161
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:54,715
but she surprised me instead.

162
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,051
Even you have run away from home?

163
00:18:01,686 --> 00:18:03,103
What do you mean even you?

164
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,475
Even you?

165
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,301
Cheers to that!

166
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:11,902
Cheers to running away.

167
00:18:28,643 --> 00:18:31,278
So Mansi, where do you stay here?

168
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:34,854
Here, in Malvi nagar, at her place.

169
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,175
There's a big problem man.

170
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:41,275
What?

171
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,322
Can I have your number?

172
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:06,230
'The number you have dialled
is not in service at this time.'

173
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,404
Veer

174
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:22,703
I need your help.

175
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,921
Yes, I am coming.

176
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:56,112
- Hellooooooo!
- Hello

177
00:19:56,594 --> 00:20:00,042
- Are you okay?
- No, I have to pee urgently.

178
00:20:00,217 --> 00:20:04,026
Okay, straight and to your right.

179
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:07,074
Switch will be on the left and...

180
00:20:07,854 --> 00:20:09,676
please flush the toilet.

181
00:20:09,981 --> 00:20:12,277
Why is the bag so heavy?

182
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,990
Do you do house keeping part time?

183
00:20:18,586 --> 00:20:19,654
What do you mean?

184
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,427
I mean, that your bathroom
is cleaner than my bedroom.

185
00:20:26,995 --> 00:20:28,665
Now, cleanliness is a crime?

186
00:20:29,093 --> 00:20:30,559
Yes, it's a crime.

187
00:20:30,767 --> 00:20:33,203
Who keeps it so clean?

188
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,843
I like making a mess at home.

189
00:20:37,663 --> 00:20:41,185
And I like cleaning it up.

190
00:20:42,586 --> 00:20:44,728
Neat and clean.

191
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,855
And now, you are
reminding me of my mother.

192
00:20:49,699 --> 00:20:54,532
So please tell your mom, what
are you doing here at 2 in the night?

193
00:20:57,794 --> 00:20:59,016
I will tell you.

194
00:21:01,314 --> 00:21:02,293
Do you have beer?

195
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,973
So let me get this.

196
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:14,617
Nikki Sang left you
with that weirdo...

197
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:18,183
on your own.

198
00:21:21,194 --> 00:21:23,900
What kind of a girlfriend is she?
Quite irresponsible.

199
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:29,649
- Something could have happened.
- How can anything happen like that?

200
00:21:32,284 --> 00:21:36,463
In Delhi at 2 am in the night,
you are roaming around the streets...

201
00:21:36,882 --> 00:21:38,110
It's irresponsible.

202
00:21:38,243 --> 00:21:39,611
How can she be like this?

203
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,437
She's the best.

204
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:44,640
And I love her okay?

205
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:50,268
I am going to go to
McLeod Ganj to surprise her.

206
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,424
I am so excited to meet her!

207
00:21:55,557 --> 00:21:56,562
Alone?

208
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:13,656
Tell me...

209
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,343
Does your family
know that you are gay?

210
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:24,750
No

211
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:32,183
Does anyone know?

212
00:22:32,427 --> 00:22:35,898
Friends, family, best friend?

213
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:39,041
There must be someone
who knows that you are gay...

214
00:22:42,193 --> 00:22:43,836
No one knows.

215
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,282
Actually,

216
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,470
I never had the guts to tell anyone.

217
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,271
Because I am a big coward!

218
00:22:57,846 --> 00:22:59,264
Do you know why?

219
00:23:01,285 --> 00:23:03,893
Because my dad is a colonel.

220
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:07,470
Colonel Roudhawa.

221
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,561
If he gets to know
that his son is gay...

222
00:23:11,752 --> 00:23:14,723
then he will make
me march left-right-left!

223
00:23:17,656 --> 00:23:18,729
Because...

224
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:25,424
at Colonel Roudhawa's house
only men of steel can be born!

225
00:23:26,367 --> 00:23:27,378
Not gay boys.

226
00:23:27,574 --> 00:23:32,739
But at Colonel Roudhawa's
place murderers, rapists...

227
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,785
drug addicts could
have been born too, right?

228
00:23:37,464 --> 00:23:38,778
All of that will work.

229
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,443
As long as they are not homosexuals.

230
00:23:43,361 --> 00:23:49,329
So, you mean we are
worse than criminals?

231
00:23:50,492 --> 00:23:51,966
Kind of...

232
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,165
Tell me something?

233
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,397
Did you always know
that you are into girls?

234
00:24:06,306 --> 00:24:08,628
I mean, since childhood?

235
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:21,443
Till the time I was 10 years old...

236
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:24,010
I was never beaten up while
playing 'Doctor Doctor'.

237
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:29,743
And what happened when you turned 10?

238
00:24:32,719 --> 00:24:34,638
I had a neighbour.

239
00:24:35,137 --> 00:24:39,180
He was about 2 years older than me.

240
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:39,820
Okay

241
00:24:41,422 --> 00:24:44,701
He was doing my delivery as a part of
the game, when my mom saw us!

242
00:24:46,796 --> 00:24:48,442
Delivery of a baby? At the age of 10?

243
00:24:48,602 --> 00:24:49,328
Shit.

244
00:24:49,598 --> 00:24:51,054
Don't ask me man...

245
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:53,879
I was beaten up so badly after that...

246
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:58,281
And my mom thought that I
had gone out of her control now...

247
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:02,501
so she transferred me from
a Co-Ed school to a girls school.

248
00:25:04,941 --> 00:25:05,816
Then?

249
00:25:07,934 --> 00:25:08,647
Then what?

250
00:25:13,173 --> 00:25:13,859
Then?

251
00:25:14,838 --> 00:25:17,282
Then I started playing
'Doctor Doctor' with girls!

252
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:21,018
And I am playing it since then.

253
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:27,582
Well...

254
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:30,983
Cheers to that!

255
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:03,848
- So you finally remembered me?
- Yes...

256
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:07,281
A person might die trying to reach you
through calls, but you don't pick up.

257
00:27:07,361 --> 00:27:10,878
Wait a minute, I was trying to call you too
but you didn't pick up your phone either.

258
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:12,987
And Ashar said you
left abruptly last night!

259
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:14,016
I left?

260
00:27:14,276 --> 00:27:15,841
- I had to leave.
- Why?

261
00:27:16,014 --> 00:27:18,339
Didn't that asshole tell
you why did I have to leave?

262
00:27:18,486 --> 00:27:20,297
I taught him a good lesson!

263
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:22,874
He is a potential rapist,
bloody molester!

264
00:27:22,954 --> 00:27:25,159
Why are you getting into this?
Please leave it.

265
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:27,449
I am really mind fucked.

266
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,061
You seriously tell me,
what are we going to do?

267
00:27:30,352 --> 00:27:31,204
Umm...

268
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:34,028
Let me come to Delhi first,

269
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:35,786
then we will see what to do.

270
00:27:35,994 --> 00:27:37,171
Yeah I love you too.

271
00:28:39,666 --> 00:28:42,115
It used to be our favourite song.

272
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,680
You made me listen to it so many times,
that it became my favourite too.

273
00:28:50,863 --> 00:28:52,164
I know, but...

274
00:28:53,866 --> 00:28:55,988
Things change over time I guess...

275
00:28:58,182 --> 00:28:59,372
So easily?

276
00:29:07,424 --> 00:29:09,057
Why are you doing this?

277
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:12,772
You know I love you right?

278
00:29:15,869 --> 00:29:19,198
You know this since day one,
that I can't make this public...

279
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:20,967
I can't be vocal about this.

280
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:24,105
Its not the same
for me as its for you.

281
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,850
My family, reputation, the business
its all on stake if it happens.

282
00:29:32,749 --> 00:29:35,649
Half of the Delhi knows Akshay Mittal!

283
00:29:36,854 --> 00:29:37,925
What do I do?

284
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:46,978
Its not as easy as it seems.

285
00:29:57,346 --> 00:29:58,696
So it's over now?

286
00:30:02,476 --> 00:30:03,660
It's up to you.

287
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:08,191
If you get married...

288
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,623
things will remain the
way they were in the past.

289
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,183
You know Akshay?

290
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,364
Mitali told me that day...

291
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:34,123
Veer, don't ever be like him.

292
00:30:36,204 --> 00:30:37,825
And I promised her...

293
00:30:39,647 --> 00:30:41,515
that I will never be like you.

294
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,283
Hello!

295
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:15,549
Akshay, we are getting late!

296
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:16,895
Are you going somewhere?

297
00:33:17,441 --> 00:33:18,392
Why?

298
00:33:18,988 --> 00:33:21,739
No, I thought you were going
somewhere cause are dressed up.

299
00:33:21,926 --> 00:33:23,709
Not just me, both of us had to go.

300
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:28,402
Today is Pooja's anniversary.
We both are invited.

301
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,531
Right, sorry...

302
00:33:32,655 --> 00:33:34,346
It slipped my mind, sorry.

303
00:33:34,426 --> 00:33:36,304
And I am waiting here since an hour.

304
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:38,465
I had an urgent meeting... so...

305
00:33:39,633 --> 00:33:42,425
So, now should I change? Or will you?

306
00:33:44,713 --> 00:33:46,633
And Veer didn't come?

307
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,850
If he had come,
would you rather go with him?

308
00:33:50,707 --> 00:33:53,356
And should I only check
where he is and what he is doing...

309
00:33:53,887 --> 00:33:54,905
I simply asked.

310
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,515
Why are you getting so irritated?

311
00:33:56,807 --> 00:33:59,320
Whenever he comes to Delhi,
he mostly stays with us right?

312
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,096
Yeah, but from now on he won't.

313
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:05,088
Anyway, I have a lot of things to do.
So if you want to go, you should leave.

314
00:34:07,939 --> 00:34:08,936
Yeah, I know.

315
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,422
Just like every other time,
its me who has to change.

316
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,177
Where were you?

317
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,370
I have been calling you since so long.

318
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,575
You know I have to leave right?

319
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:00,468
Favourite song has changed...

320
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:02,391
Even father didn't listens...

321
00:35:03,071 --> 00:35:04,902
Nobody listens to Veer...

322
00:35:05,274 --> 00:35:07,223
Everyone keeps telling me to adjust...

323
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,579
Yes Sir, No Sir,
Right Sir, Okay Sir...

324
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:12,088
Favourite song...

325
00:35:12,691 --> 00:35:14,101
Suddenly changed...

326
00:35:14,918 --> 00:35:16,723
Dad doesn't listen,
Akshay also doesn't listen to me…

327
00:35:16,903 --> 00:35:18,047
Nobody listens to Veer.

328
00:35:19,398 --> 00:35:22,256
Favourite song changed… what is it?

329
00:35:23,595 --> 00:35:24,807
How? Why?

330
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,600
Yes Sir, No Sir,
Right Sir, Okay Sir...

331
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:30,375
Veer...

332
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,455
Dad doesn't listen...

333
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,242
Akshay also doesn't listen to me...

334
00:35:34,322 --> 00:35:35,362
Nobody listens.

335
00:35:36,544 --> 00:35:37,882
- Favourite song...
- Veer…

336
00:35:39,808 --> 00:35:41,022
What happened?

337
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:55,571
Will you come with me to McLeod Ganj?

338
00:35:57,154 --> 00:36:00,066
Take me anywhere man,
just far away from here.

339
00:36:00,967 --> 00:36:02,500
Will you drive?

340
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:18,512
What are you doing?

341
00:36:25,451 --> 00:36:26,401
Listen...

342
00:36:34,883 --> 00:36:37,025
The dumbass is dead asleep, leave him!

343
00:36:41,573 --> 00:36:43,605
- Mansi, let's go.
- Take the keys.

344
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,025
You leave, I will come.

345
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:48,370
I will just write a note and come.

346
00:37:17,709 --> 00:37:26,358
(Song: Who am I...)

347
00:38:28,214 --> 00:38:30,560
2 parathas (Indian breads) for me,
I will come from the washroom.

348
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,424
Only two?

349
00:38:46,887 --> 00:38:49,230
Never thought I will travel like this.

350
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:51,002
Thank you.

351
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:54,394
You're welcome.

352
00:38:55,098 --> 00:38:57,215
We are on our way, have fun!

353
00:38:58,359 --> 00:38:59,528
Tell me one thing?

354
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:01,948
How fast can you drive?

355
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:03,101
What do you mean?

356
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:06,781
I mean, how fast can you drive a car?

357
00:39:07,095 --> 00:39:07,980
Why?

358
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:19,210
I have always had a fantasy.

359
00:39:19,348 --> 00:39:21,145
That I am eating at
a roadside restaurant,

360
00:39:21,514 --> 00:39:23,306
with my stomach absolutely full...

361
00:39:23,386 --> 00:39:26,091
and I run away without
paying the bill!

362
00:39:27,047 --> 00:39:27,891
Listen...

363
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:32,278
We will do one thing...

364
00:39:33,757 --> 00:39:35,721
I am ding this, we are not doing this.

365
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:37,537
I don't know you if you do this.

366
00:39:37,946 --> 00:39:41,315
I am the one who's running away,
you just have to start the car!

367
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:45,407
No.

368
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,633
At least, listen to the plan?

369
00:39:46,713 --> 00:39:47,456
Listen...

370
00:39:47,864 --> 00:39:52,316
You go start the car, give
full acceleration and get ready...

371
00:39:52,931 --> 00:39:58,208
I will go inside, take out my wallet
and I will take out some money from it,

372
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:01,155
He will think I am going to pay him...

373
00:40:02,174 --> 00:40:03,408
But I won't pay him.

374
00:40:04,629 --> 00:40:08,456
I will straight away come
to you and we will run away together!

375
00:40:08,921 --> 00:40:10,238
See how good my plan is?

376
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:11,949
You are getting scared for no reason.

377
00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:17,168
Mansi, its a very bad plan. No.

378
00:40:19,349 --> 00:40:21,895
Let's do it!
We will have a lot of fun!

379
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:23,965
Mansi...

380
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:27,700
No means no.

381
00:40:34,882 --> 00:40:36,044
Uncle, girl is running away?

382
00:40:36,124 --> 00:40:38,251
Hey girl, where are you running?

383
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:40,667
Come sit, sit, sit!

384
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:41,979
Lets go, let's go.

385
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:51,158
Oh my god! Moments like these!

386
00:40:52,685 --> 00:40:55,347
What did you get after doing this?
Poor guy didn't even get his money.

387
00:40:55,427 --> 00:40:57,578
Don't worry about him.
His restaurant is high in demand.

388
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:00,185
Nothing will happen if he doesn't
get this small amount of money.

389
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:02,838
I had a lot of fun!!
Didn't you have fun?

390
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,299
Even I had a lot of fun!

391
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,398
Then it's all good.
We should have fun, no matter what.

392
00:41:08,846 --> 00:41:10,715
Do you know this? You are crazy!

393
00:41:11,596 --> 00:41:12,641
I know.

394
00:41:13,389 --> 00:41:14,859
My dad used to say the same thing.

395
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:17,113
I mean, he still does.

396
00:42:20,842 --> 00:42:22,365
I guess we are lost?

397
00:42:23,094 --> 00:42:23,869
Let me check...

398
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:35,852
Excuse me,
this is the way for McLeod Ganj right?

399
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,372
Yes, there is a way. But it will take
you two and a half hours from here.

400
00:42:38,452 --> 00:42:39,515
You have taken the wrong way.

401
00:42:39,768 --> 00:42:42,019
Palampur is nearby,
you should stay there.

402
00:42:43,103 --> 00:42:44,715
Palampur is closer from here.

403
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:45,729
It will take two and a half hours?

404
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:48,253
Yes, till McLeod Ganj.
And the roads are in bad shape.

405
00:42:48,523 --> 00:42:49,679
Okay, thank you.

406
00:42:52,035 --> 00:42:52,894
Happy?

407
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,297
I thought the...

408
00:42:54,377 --> 00:42:57,071
You thought? But I was looking
at the maps and telling you...

409
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,262
that Veer,
its not from here, its from there.

410
00:42:59,448 --> 00:43:01,082
Why don't you accept it?

411
00:43:01,675 --> 00:43:02,340
I am sorry...

412
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,856
- What do you mean sorry?
- I will go to the hotel...

413
00:43:03,936 --> 00:43:06,214
I don't care about the hotel,
I want to meet Nikki!

414
00:43:06,294 --> 00:43:07,748
First thing tomorrow morning, promise!

415
00:43:07,828 --> 00:43:09,193
Promise, sorry!

416
00:43:20,827 --> 00:43:22,383
I am booking the hotel now.

417
00:43:39,558 --> 00:43:41,916
'Isn't this too fancy a hotel?

418
00:43:43,597 --> 00:43:44,885
So what did you want?

419
00:43:45,282 --> 00:43:48,927
That we live in a cheap,
paid by an hour hotel?

420
00:43:49,524 --> 00:43:51,071
That's what real adventures are about!

421
00:43:53,294 --> 00:43:55,655
I have seen your choices
at the Dhabha(Roadside restaurant).

422
00:43:55,794 --> 00:43:58,175
From now on, I will be
the one taking all the decisions.

423
00:44:31,607 --> 00:44:32,788
Isn't it nice?

424
00:44:33,816 --> 00:44:34,601
Very.

425
00:44:37,636 --> 00:44:39,660
You know, I love floral walls!

426
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:42,334
We will sleep peacefully tonight,
and tomorrow we will get you to Nikki.

427
00:44:42,414 --> 00:44:43,887
I am so tired man!

428
00:45:05,487 --> 00:45:07,529
Where did it go?

429
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:13,000
- Mansi...
- Ahh, there.

430
00:45:13,205 --> 00:45:14,401
What are you doing?

431
00:45:15,798 --> 00:45:20,566
It's such a nice room, just
imagine how nice the bathroom must be!

432
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:22,722
So, I am going for a bath.

433
00:45:23,156 --> 00:45:24,017
Can I?

434
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:29,860
Okay, listen...
please call for something to eat.

435
00:45:30,047 --> 00:45:30,797
Sure.

436
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:01,019
Have you ordered something to eat?

437
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,317
What the crap?

438
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:09,224
Yes, I will order
some pasta for you...

439
00:46:09,304 --> 00:46:11,069
And I think, I need a drink.

440
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:12,780
To spend the night…

441
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:17,551
Hello...

442
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,659
Veer...

443
00:46:22,697 --> 00:46:24,416
Can you please pass me my bra?

444
00:46:24,691 --> 00:46:25,502
Bra?

445
00:46:26,705 --> 00:46:28,017
The black one...

446
00:46:41,596 --> 00:46:42,894
Do you need anything else?

447
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:44,728
No, just wait for 2 minutes...

448
00:46:47,413 --> 00:46:51,316
Veer, can you help me a little?
I am struggling with this...

449
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,730
Help with?

450
00:46:59,125 --> 00:47:00,768
How much time will you take?

451
00:47:01,106 --> 00:47:02,954
I am trying my best, Mansi.

452
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,753
Is this your first time?

453
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:08,358
Yes, it is my first time.

454
00:47:19,516 --> 00:47:21,254
You are making fun of me right?

455
00:47:21,334 --> 00:47:22,888
No, I am laughing at your expense...

456
00:47:26,897 --> 00:47:28,639
Tell me one thing...

457
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:32,806
What happened to you this morning?

458
00:47:33,418 --> 00:47:34,489
When in the morning?

459
00:47:35,557 --> 00:47:39,225
When you just started
mumbling/talking to yourself?

460
00:47:39,753 --> 00:47:42,772
I thought of asking you earlier,
but I forgot about it...

461
00:47:43,883 --> 00:47:45,164
Sorry for that...

462
00:47:45,592 --> 00:47:48,360
Whenever I feel lonely...

463
00:47:50,387 --> 00:47:52,206
I start talking to myself...

464
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:55,738
It's been the same since childhood...

465
00:47:59,939 --> 00:48:05,345
Now, I am there for you.
Don't ever feel alone again.

466
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:11,337
Now don't get too emotional,
go and see if the food has come.

467
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:13,287
- I did place the order...
- Go...

468
00:48:40,076 --> 00:48:41,951
- Aren't they close to us?
- Who?

469
00:48:46,122 --> 00:48:46,701
These...

470
00:48:46,781 --> 00:48:47,546
stars...

471
00:48:47,768 --> 00:48:48,681
to all of us...

472
00:48:59,516 --> 00:49:00,435
And us?

473
00:49:07,025 --> 00:49:07,971
US...

474
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:11,663
we are very far...

475
00:49:14,865 --> 00:49:15,996
Do you know?

476
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,127
Every house has a star of its own,
in the form of a dream.

477
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,136
You must also have one?

478
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,439
A star?

479
00:49:31,713 --> 00:49:34,005
I mean, a dream?

480
00:49:34,987 --> 00:49:35,952
I had a dream...

481
00:49:37,321 --> 00:49:38,542
to become a bride.

482
00:49:40,585 --> 00:49:43,579
When I was in class five, I would sit
in front of the mirror for hours...

483
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:48,288
Wearing my mom's saree, putting
her bindi, wearing her red lipstick...

484
00:49:48,461 --> 00:49:49,961
I would keep looking at myself...

485
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:52,505
Then I used to feel back then...

486
00:49:52,691 --> 00:49:54,812
that we only grow up
so that we could get married.

487
00:49:55,053 --> 00:49:56,815
And the husband is the return gift.

488
00:50:04,077 --> 00:50:05,494
But there was one thing...

489
00:50:06,649 --> 00:50:08,864
that I realised very late in life...

490
00:50:12,564 --> 00:50:15,391
I could never see my husband...

491
00:50:16,515 --> 00:50:20,690
it was me on this side of the mirror
and another girl on the other side.

492
00:50:29,548 --> 00:50:31,055
You must also be having...

493
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:32,925
a star?

494
00:50:39,867 --> 00:50:41,039
There, that one!

495
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:42,819
Where?

496
00:50:43,425 --> 00:50:45,830
That tiny small one,
which is shining the most.

497
00:50:46,133 --> 00:50:47,224
Where is it?

498
00:50:47,361 --> 00:50:49,771
There, the tiniest one!

499
00:50:51,676 --> 00:50:52,729
The most unique.

500
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,888
My dream was...

501
00:51:03,087 --> 00:51:04,030
my dream is...

502
00:51:04,645 --> 00:51:08,865
That I hug my father tightly...

503
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:15,791
And tell him that dad
that I am not what you think...

504
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:19,115
I am me.

505
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:27,185
But I could never tell him.

506
00:51:30,918 --> 00:51:32,518
Never had the courage.

507
00:51:36,709 --> 00:51:41,481
Because my father is not a dad,
he is a teacher!

508
00:51:45,224 --> 00:51:48,787
Whatever he said,
I kept doing it...

509
00:51:50,845 --> 00:51:54,107
I wanted to be a painter,
but dad said Veer...

510
00:51:54,859 --> 00:51:56,039
do your MBA.

511
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:00,171
So I did it.

512
00:52:01,191 --> 00:52:02,262
I said okay sir.

513
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:11,677
You know...

514
00:52:14,406 --> 00:52:16,162
He is a very good teacher...

515
00:52:18,145 --> 00:52:21,520
...but a complete failure as a father.

516
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:31,733
Exhausted?

517
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:35,381
There is too much of work load.

518
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:37,617
There's product launch.

519
00:53:41,294 --> 00:53:42,332
Till when?

520
00:53:43,251 --> 00:53:44,556
Till when, what?

521
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,333
Till when you will keep
making the excuse of work load?

522
00:53:52,975 --> 00:53:54,366
Excuse?

523
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:59,402
You think all of this is an excuse?

524
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:03,104
Yes, I think so.

525
00:54:05,629 --> 00:54:07,111
I am tired...

526
00:54:10,506 --> 00:54:12,656
of trying to keep myself happy...

527
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:21,070
You have not had 10 minutes
for me in these 10 months...

528
00:54:21,374 --> 00:54:23,569
So what should I do?
Should I leave my work?

529
00:54:27,218 --> 00:54:29,656
Just take out some
time for ourselves...

530
00:54:29,852 --> 00:54:33,138
No Mitali, to run a business
you have to be practical.

531
00:54:33,558 --> 00:54:35,558
I can't be emotional like you.

532
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:37,958
Practical?

533
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:41,964
Look, I haven't slept.

534
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,522
Tomorrow there is
a very important meeting.

535
00:54:43,602 --> 00:54:44,862
Let this launch get over...

536
00:54:44,942 --> 00:54:47,401
then I will come back home
and we can fight as much as you like.

537
00:54:48,423 --> 00:54:49,227
Good night.

538
00:54:52,173 --> 00:54:53,080
Good night...

539
00:54:57,736 --> 00:54:58,786
good night.

540
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,301
Wow!

541
00:55:10,621 --> 00:55:12,092
It's pretty right?

542
00:55:14,199 --> 00:55:16,274
The place is so nice.

543
00:55:19,259 --> 00:55:24,771
The air is so fresh!
I feel like eating all of it.

544
00:55:31,112 --> 00:55:33,904
Mansi, don't eat so much of air,
you get more fat.

545
00:55:35,316 --> 00:55:37,596
I am not fat, you are too thin.

546
00:55:37,808 --> 00:55:39,532
You need it more than me.

547
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:41,775
You also do it, it's a lot of fun!

548
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:46,062
If I stand and have fun,
who's going to drive?

549
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:48,168
I will drive.

550
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,545
You know how to drive?

551
00:55:52,193 --> 00:55:54,836
Of course,
what kind of a question is that?

552
00:55:57,879 --> 00:55:59,494
- What happened?
- So, one minute.

553
00:55:59,574 --> 00:56:01,333
Why have I been driving
since the last two days?

554
00:56:01,467 --> 00:56:04,058
Because you seemed
very happy to be driving.

555
00:56:04,355 --> 00:56:05,385
Please drive.

556
00:56:05,547 --> 00:56:06,533
Okay.

557
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:09,158
I will rest a little.

558
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,244
I am sure this is fun.

559
00:56:29,324 --> 00:56:30,535
Have some air, you really need it.

560
00:56:30,615 --> 00:56:32,780
No, I am going to get some rest.

561
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:34,727
So, are you ready?

562
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:36,247
Ready... Set...

563
00:56:36,423 --> 00:56:37,333
Sorry.

564
00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:42,157
Mansi, my seatbelt is stuck.

565
00:56:42,713 --> 00:56:44,910
It's okay, I am comfortable.
I will sleep.

566
00:56:45,081 --> 00:56:46,031
Let's go.

567
00:56:46,161 --> 00:56:47,072
Come on.

568
00:56:47,846 --> 00:56:48,798
What happened?

569
00:56:49,097 --> 00:56:54,083
Tell me something?
Do I put the first gear, up or down?

570
00:56:56,136 --> 00:56:57,291
- Mansi...
- I will figure...

571
00:56:57,371 --> 00:56:58,767
You do know how to drive this thing?

572
00:56:58,927 --> 00:57:01,338
Mansi, Mansi, Mansi!
Mansi, easy!!

573
00:57:01,778 --> 00:57:02,576
Mansi!

574
00:57:03,385 --> 00:57:05,231
Mansi, easy!!

575
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:07,958
(Car crashes)

576
00:57:17,878 --> 00:57:24,227
(Song: You are getting
popular in my heart)

577
01:00:59,283 --> 01:01:02,123
Brother, your car is badly damaged.
And I need some advance.

578
01:01:03,805 --> 01:01:05,965
Tomorrow for sure right?

579
01:01:06,157 --> 01:01:07,779
- Sure.
- Thank you.

580
01:01:07,859 --> 01:01:09,508
Yes, tomorrow you will get it.

581
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,475
What's wrong with you?

582
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,715
Sorry man.

583
01:01:19,795 --> 01:01:21,680
So much money got wasted.

584
01:01:22,394 --> 01:01:25,795
If I hadn't insisted on driving,
we wouldn't have had this accident...

585
01:01:26,041 --> 01:01:28,995
We wouldn't have got delayed, nor
so much money would have been wasted.

586
01:01:29,195 --> 01:01:30,043
Correct.

587
01:01:30,867 --> 01:01:35,373
You don't stress,
all this money that we have wasted...

588
01:01:35,521 --> 01:01:38,664
I will claim it from you.
That too with interest.

589
01:01:39,402 --> 01:01:40,868
What an ass, are you!

590
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:43,644
I am sympathizing with you, and you!

591
01:01:45,738 --> 01:01:49,274
Alright, son! I will return it to you.
Each and every penny.

592
01:01:49,354 --> 01:01:50,090
Very good.

593
01:01:50,170 --> 01:01:53,138
For the hotel, the food...
including the petrol money.

594
01:01:53,263 --> 01:01:54,326
Very, very good.

595
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:57,245
And listen, don't sympathize
and have pity on me.

596
01:01:58,324 --> 01:02:01,717
And if you have any problem returning,
I will give you an alternate option...

597
01:02:01,881 --> 01:02:04,970
Return it the money in EMI,
in instalments, break the amount down.

598
01:02:05,296 --> 01:02:08,059
You are such a big asshole!

599
01:02:10,598 --> 01:02:14,401
Okay listen,
now because of this car...

600
01:02:14,977 --> 01:02:17,843
we will have to stay
here for one more night...

601
01:02:18,372 --> 01:02:21,451
Then you head to your in laws place,
and I will be on my way home.

602
01:02:21,531 --> 01:02:22,592
Home?

603
01:02:22,867 --> 01:02:24,222
Where? Chandigarh?

604
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,700
- Yes.
- Where else will I go?

605
01:02:27,005 --> 01:02:29,955
They will scold me a little,
but I will survive.

606
01:02:30,645 --> 01:02:32,453
But I will tell you one thing Mansi...

607
01:02:35,824 --> 01:02:38,471
These last few days the
amount of fun I have had...

608
01:02:38,998 --> 01:02:41,845
I have never been this
happy in my entire life!

609
01:02:43,193 --> 01:02:44,384
So, thank you.

610
01:02:44,566 --> 01:02:46,596
No man, thank you.

611
01:02:47,312 --> 01:02:50,384
I haven't felt this special,
ever before.

612
01:02:52,056 --> 01:02:55,507
If you were a girl,
I swear I would have married you.

613
01:02:56,855 --> 01:02:58,755
- So let's do it.
- Really?

614
01:02:59,095 --> 01:03:00,262
You are crazy.

615
01:03:05,306 --> 01:03:06,952
Tomorrow you will meet Nikki...

616
01:03:07,130 --> 01:03:10,969
by that logic it is
your last night of this journey.

617
01:03:11,612 --> 01:03:12,587
Ours.

618
01:03:12,734 --> 01:03:14,228
Yes, our last night.

619
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,366
You deserve a farewell party!

620
01:03:17,419 --> 01:03:18,485
- Party?
- Yes!

621
01:03:18,724 --> 01:03:19,524
Where?

622
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:21,567
It's a surprise from Veer.

623
01:03:59,676 --> 01:04:00,726
Hello?

624
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:04,372
Is anyone there?

625
01:04:17,789 --> 01:04:19,489
Some wine for you Ma'am?

626
01:04:20,051 --> 01:04:20,901
Not me.

627
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:24,463
I have a friend with me,
if you find him please send him.

628
01:04:24,658 --> 01:04:25,539
Sure, ma'am.

629
01:04:26,134 --> 01:04:29,861
Especially for you,
the food has been cooked.

630
01:04:30,051 --> 01:04:31,236
Here's the menu.

631
01:04:35,904 --> 01:04:39,590
Four dishes,
and all of are my favourites.

632
01:04:40,439 --> 01:04:41,239
Yes Ma'am.

633
01:04:41,668 --> 01:04:42,815
I like that.

634
01:04:44,649 --> 01:04:46,458
Should I serve you the food?

635
01:05:06,289 --> 01:05:08,440
Chef Veer Pratap Roudhawa has...

636
01:05:10,888 --> 01:05:12,406
Especially for you...

637
01:05:13,507 --> 01:05:20,890
Because to eat is your
hobby and to cook is his.

638
01:05:21,365 --> 01:05:22,520
How nice!

639
01:05:24,247 --> 01:05:25,890
Can you please send him?

640
01:05:26,474 --> 01:05:27,524
Sure ma'am.

641
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,580
Chef Veer at your service.

642
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:05,780
So, you asked the entire
staff to take the evening off?

643
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:08,858
Spent so much more money?

644
01:06:09,155 --> 01:06:11,066
This I will not return.

645
01:06:12,156 --> 01:06:13,732
I didn't spend anything much...

646
01:06:14,377 --> 01:06:21,860
and whatever little I did,
this much I can afford for you.

647
01:06:23,045 --> 01:06:25,107
All four dishes are your favourites...

648
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:28,106
and I have myself prepared
it with my own hands.

649
01:06:28,186 --> 01:06:29,203
How nice!

650
01:06:30,668 --> 01:06:33,139
That's why you were missing
the entire evening...

651
01:06:40,842 --> 01:06:42,665
Thank you for everything, Veer.

652
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:47,800
Thanks to you I haven't missed Nikki.

653
01:06:51,886 --> 01:06:52,660
Cheers to that!

654
01:06:52,785 --> 01:06:53,769
Cheers.

655
01:07:00,851 --> 01:07:03,039
You both really love each other,
don't you?

656
01:07:04,115 --> 01:07:04,834
Yes.

657
01:07:07,236 --> 01:07:08,465
It's been four years.

658
01:07:11,502 --> 01:07:14,922
She was a fresher in college
and I was in the final year.

659
01:07:16,603 --> 01:07:18,065
It all started with ragging.

660
01:07:18,333 --> 01:07:21,090
You saved her from ragging?

661
01:07:21,658 --> 01:07:24,358
No, I ragged her a lot.

662
01:07:25,206 --> 01:07:26,754
Poor thing, she started crying!

663
01:07:26,906 --> 01:07:32,112
And then, you consoled her...

664
01:07:32,903 --> 01:07:36,104
Then one thing led
to the other. And...

665
01:07:36,184 --> 01:07:37,827
How do you know?

666
01:07:39,733 --> 01:07:44,516
I am not as dumb as I come across.

667
01:07:46,778 --> 01:07:47,792
You know...

668
01:07:50,431 --> 01:07:54,852
Akshay tells me that love
is actually beyond gender...

669
01:07:57,290 --> 01:08:01,085
And sometimes where there is love,
there is lust...

670
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:05,833
And at other times,
there is just pure love.

671
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08,505
An intense feeling of affection.

672
01:08:09,822 --> 01:08:15,099
According to him, anyone, at any
time can fall in love with anyone...

673
01:08:15,664 --> 01:08:18,090
A man can fall in love with a man, a
woman can fall in love with a woman...

674
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:20,032
A woman can fall in love with a man...

675
01:08:22,786 --> 01:08:26,180
Basically sometimes
he tells me that...

676
01:08:27,055 --> 01:08:31,151
sexuality and sex between
two people can be situational...

677
01:08:31,997 --> 01:08:34,474
And sexuality is actually genderless.

678
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:35,907
Like...

679
01:08:38,388 --> 01:08:39,632
being agender...

680
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,875
non gendered,
moving between genders...

681
01:08:41,955 --> 01:08:43,770
Stop, just stop!

682
01:08:45,378 --> 01:08:47,699
Why are you sounding so scientific?

683
01:08:48,416 --> 01:08:50,624
So what you are trying to say is?

684
01:08:50,879 --> 01:08:53,672
That if I am aroused right now...

685
01:08:54,788 --> 01:08:57,753
As in if we are aroused right now...

686
01:08:58,513 --> 01:09:00,016
So something can happen between us?

687
01:09:00,096 --> 01:09:01,302
When did I say that?

688
01:09:01,425 --> 01:09:03,759
Logically that's what it means right?

689
01:09:05,726 --> 01:09:07,107
C'mon, let's try it.

690
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,822
What do you mean let's try?

691
01:09:11,388 --> 01:09:13,684
You like having fun right?

692
01:09:17,589 --> 01:09:19,056
I like having fun sometimes...

693
01:09:22,209 --> 01:09:24,653
You start feeling guilty
the moment you have fun.

694
01:09:24,986 --> 01:09:25,936
Isn't it?

695
01:09:27,068 --> 01:09:27,816
Is it?

696
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:49,189
(Song: Is it there, isn't it there?)

697
01:11:28,136 --> 01:11:30,948
'We were close, yet far.'

698
01:11:32,343 --> 01:11:35,618
'Something was bringing us closer...'

699
01:11:37,839 --> 01:11:41,389
'But there was also something
that was stopping us...'

700
01:12:10,801 --> 01:12:11,715
Veer!

701
01:12:14,294 --> 01:12:15,757
Should we stay here for one more day?

702
01:12:18,446 --> 01:12:21,618
Please man,
let's extend it for one more day.

703
01:12:22,966 --> 01:12:24,604
Mansi, why did we come from Delhi?

704
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:28,268
To make you meet Nikki.

705
01:12:29,294 --> 01:12:30,549
Let me make you meet Nikki once...

706
01:12:30,629 --> 01:12:33,451
then we will stay at any place,
any time that you tell me.

707
01:12:34,898 --> 01:12:36,005
Okay, let's go now?

708
01:12:36,805 --> 01:12:39,276
It's a very heavy bag.
Will you pick it up?

709
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:41,681
I will pick it up along with you.

710
01:12:46,296 --> 01:12:47,646
Thanks ya, Mansi.

711
01:12:52,222 --> 01:12:53,744
My life needed this break.

712
01:12:56,626 --> 01:12:58,681
You will miss me a lot, won't you?

713
01:12:59,914 --> 01:13:03,414
So, come with me. What will
you do after going back anyway?

714
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:08,696
What will I do in the
middle with the both of you?

715
01:13:09,636 --> 01:13:11,207
What do you mean by what will you do?

716
01:13:11,355 --> 01:13:13,790
You will drive the car, what else!

717
01:13:43,465 --> 01:13:44,627
Is this the place?

718
01:13:47,167 --> 01:13:47,920
Mansi?

719
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:48,850
Mostly.

720
01:13:50,393 --> 01:13:52,779
That's what the aunty said on our way.

721
01:14:05,197 --> 01:14:06,303
Wow, man!

722
01:14:09,143 --> 01:14:10,676
Your girlfriend is pretty rich!

723
01:14:11,883 --> 01:14:13,792
Even I just got to know this.

724
01:14:14,203 --> 01:14:16,782
She never told me
that her dad is the MLA.

725
01:14:17,053 --> 01:14:18,886
I used to always pay for food.

726
01:14:19,091 --> 01:14:20,270
She might have forgotten about it.

727
01:14:20,350 --> 01:14:21,958
Forgot her own dad?

728
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:28,220
My father in law has hunted
a bird and kept it as a show piece.

729
01:14:33,013 --> 01:14:34,707
Surprise!!

730
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:36,046
Hey...

731
01:14:37,918 --> 01:14:39,374
How are you?

732
01:14:39,545 --> 01:14:41,974
I missed you.

733
01:14:42,302 --> 01:14:44,804
- Yeah, I missed you too.
- Oh, this is Veer.

734
01:14:45,316 --> 01:14:46,838
He gave me shelter
when I was in Delhi.

735
01:14:46,918 --> 01:14:48,319
Oh, hi Veer.

736
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:49,632
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

737
01:14:49,956 --> 01:14:52,980
How did you keep
up with this mad girl?

738
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,043
Mad girl?

739
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:56,195
She does everything
without thinking about it.

740
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:57,499
She is crazy. Isn't she?

741
01:14:57,801 --> 01:15:01,281
Well, to tell you honestly,
we are a lot alike.

742
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:03,407
Oh, oh.

743
01:15:03,907 --> 01:15:06,404
Congratulations on
this new friendship.

744
01:15:06,631 --> 01:15:07,565
Thank you.

745
01:15:08,596 --> 01:15:12,353
Mumma, this is Mansi...

746
01:15:12,433 --> 01:15:13,257
- Hello
- Hi

747
01:15:14,003 --> 01:15:16,523
and that is Veer- her boyfriend.

748
01:15:17,745 --> 01:15:19,396
Hi, lovely to meet you.

749
01:15:19,476 --> 01:15:21,193
Lovely to meet you too.

750
01:15:21,943 --> 01:15:25,768
I am really sorry but I have
to go out for a while but Nikki...

751
01:15:26,044 --> 01:15:27,540
make sure they eat something okay?

752
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,378
- Yeah yeah.
- Take care of them, yeah?

753
01:15:30,105 --> 01:15:33,717
It's a pleasure guys I will
see you again in a while. Okay, bye.

754
01:15:33,903 --> 01:15:34,962
- Bye.
- Bye

755
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:43,241
Boyfriend?

756
01:15:43,771 --> 01:15:44,736
What was this?

757
01:15:44,816 --> 01:15:46,562
You told me your brother
was getting married...

758
01:15:46,748 --> 01:15:48,997
but looking at your house,
it doesn't seem like it.

759
01:15:50,287 --> 01:15:53,671
Listen , I lied.

760
01:15:56,044 --> 01:15:56,824
Why?

761
01:16:00,942 --> 01:16:01,593
I will tell you.

762
01:16:01,935 --> 01:16:03,112
Then, tell me.

763
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:05,380
Not here...

764
01:16:06,641 --> 01:16:07,500
let's go out.

765
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:12,705
So, thats the whole story.

766
01:16:13,515 --> 01:16:15,242
You could have told me this before.

767
01:16:15,845 --> 01:16:17,622
I wouldn't have run away from home.

768
01:16:18,135 --> 01:16:21,303
How could I know that
my dad would lie to me?

769
01:16:23,335 --> 01:16:28,605
I didn't tell you cause I thought it's
my matter and I will take care of it.

770
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:32,540
Since when is it my
matter and your matter?

771
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:37,787
I really love you.

772
01:16:38,696 --> 01:16:39,858
I love you too.

773
01:16:40,285 --> 01:16:42,393
I don't want to marry that person.

774
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:43,932
So, don't marry him.

775
01:16:45,831 --> 01:16:47,133
Did you talk to your dad about this?

776
01:16:51,584 --> 01:16:52,691
I spoke to mom.

777
01:16:54,644 --> 01:16:59,997
And she said that dad has a status and
we as a family have to maintain it...

778
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,192
You don't stress about it,
I will talk to them about it.

779
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:11,406
Okay.

780
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,003
Hello Sir.

781
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:25,545
Sorry to interrupt you, I am Mansi.

782
01:17:26,303 --> 01:17:28,009
Nikki's friend from college...

783
01:17:28,374 --> 01:17:29,431
Hello, Mansi.

784
01:17:29,797 --> 01:17:31,573
Sir, I need to speak to you.

785
01:17:32,736 --> 01:17:33,556
Go ahead.

786
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:35,487
In private?

787
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:38,446
Okay sir.

788
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:39,657
Come.

789
01:17:41,553 --> 01:17:42,453
Tell me?

790
01:17:42,654 --> 01:17:45,089
Sir, you are a busy man.

791
01:17:46,219 --> 01:17:49,357
Because of parties and politics,
you might have not noticed that...

792
01:17:49,733 --> 01:17:51,150
what Nikki wants.

793
01:17:52,712 --> 01:17:57,418
Okay, so now you are going
to tell me what my daughter wants?

794
01:17:58,921 --> 01:17:59,786
Yes.

795
01:18:03,567 --> 01:18:04,381
Tell me...

796
01:18:07,026 --> 01:18:10,912
Sir, Nikki and me like each other.

797
01:18:12,041 --> 01:18:12,750
Okay...

798
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:16,223
go ahead.

799
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:20,148
Sir...

800
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:25,149
sir we love each other.

801
01:18:29,006 --> 01:18:31,047
Sir, we would like to live together.

802
01:18:34,825 --> 01:18:36,625
Does Nikki also want this?

803
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:39,978
Nikki, say something.

804
01:18:47,487 --> 01:18:49,065
Dad, I...

805
01:18:50,294 --> 01:18:51,257
Say it.

806
01:18:53,249 --> 01:18:55,995
Sir, she is getting nervous in
front you, Sir. But she has told me.

807
01:18:56,147 --> 01:18:59,411
She has told aunty too Sir, but she
is just getting scared in front you.

808
01:18:59,707 --> 01:19:00,925
Say it, Nikki.

809
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:06,381
Nikki, say it.

810
01:19:07,984 --> 01:19:09,082
Please say it.

811
01:19:18,448 --> 01:19:20,291
When's your flight, kid?

812
01:19:23,995 --> 01:19:26,491
Uncle, we have come by road.

813
01:19:29,093 --> 01:19:30,538
Go safely, kid.

814
01:19:42,293 --> 01:19:43,173
Nikki...

815
01:19:47,368 --> 01:19:49,095
look after your friends.

816
01:20:16,551 --> 01:20:18,364
I am sorry Mansi.

817
01:20:26,674 --> 01:20:27,549
Mansi...

818
01:20:30,286 --> 01:20:31,317
Mansi listen.

819
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:56,391
(Song: Sad version of Who am I...)

820
01:22:38,345 --> 01:22:39,768
Your father is right...

821
01:22:42,286 --> 01:22:43,486
you are crazy!

822
01:22:48,818 --> 01:22:50,036
Talk to him...

823
01:22:52,775 --> 01:22:54,275
you will feel better.

824
01:23:04,023 --> 01:23:05,058
Hello?

825
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:06,884
Hello?

826
01:23:07,478 --> 01:23:08,452
Hello, Ma?

827
01:23:09,106 --> 01:23:10,644
Who? Mansi?

828
01:23:13,173 --> 01:23:16,982
Mansi, how are you?
Are you okay Mansi?

829
01:23:17,450 --> 01:23:18,535
I am okay.

830
01:23:19,522 --> 01:23:20,768
How are you all?

831
01:23:21,160 --> 01:23:22,989
Just the way you left us.

832
01:23:23,389 --> 01:23:25,076
I am too bad right?

833
01:23:26,792 --> 01:23:28,842
I gave you all so much trouble.

834
01:23:30,043 --> 01:23:34,644
You left a letter for us,
couldn't you just speak to us?

835
01:23:36,083 --> 01:23:37,515
How is dad?

836
01:23:39,176 --> 01:23:40,526
Ask him yourself.

837
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:50,088
Dad?

838
01:23:52,885 --> 01:23:53,975
How are you?

839
01:23:55,675 --> 01:23:57,032
How should I be?

840
01:24:02,235 --> 01:24:04,212
I know I have given
you a lot of trouble.

841
01:24:05,171 --> 01:24:06,792
But what do I do dad?

842
01:24:08,353 --> 01:24:09,953
I was born this way.

843
01:24:12,129 --> 01:24:14,287
I can't help it even if I want to...

844
01:24:15,654 --> 01:24:17,215
and I won't be able to either.

845
01:24:19,983 --> 01:24:21,909
Please forgive me, my child.

846
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:28,486
I was on what I thought was a disease,
never tried to find a solution.

847
01:24:31,088 --> 01:24:35,329
Child, your school teacher failed.

848
01:24:38,277 --> 01:24:39,481
You haven't failed...

849
01:24:40,561 --> 01:24:41,568
you have passed dad.

850
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:45,078
That too with merit.

851
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:10,071
Enough, you had a chat right?

852
01:25:11,109 --> 01:25:14,727
Thank you for everything Veer,
if you hadn't been there...

853
01:25:14,807 --> 01:25:18,937
Mansi, being senti doesn't suit you.

854
01:25:20,594 --> 01:25:22,055
So, what suits me?

855
01:25:22,531 --> 01:25:24,518
Mental attitude.

856
01:25:24,928 --> 01:25:25,996
Madness.

857
01:25:27,319 --> 01:25:28,924
I want my older Mansi.

858
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:31,172
You like the 'older' Mansi?

859
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:39,528
Veer, we have a connection.

860
01:25:40,762 --> 01:25:45,261
We are alike.

861
01:25:46,866 --> 01:25:49,620
And what's happening
to us is also the same.

862
01:25:51,612 --> 01:25:52,659
How is this?

863
01:25:53,567 --> 01:25:56,927
Maybe this is what they
mean when they say soulmates.

864
01:25:59,109 --> 01:26:00,736
Soulmates.

865
01:26:01,898 --> 01:26:04,228
Yes, soulmates.

866
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:07,406
Cool...

867
01:26:08,907 --> 01:26:10,673
Cool then, let's live together.

868
01:26:10,921 --> 01:26:12,413
We should kind of get settled.

869
01:26:12,573 --> 01:26:13,777
What is kind of?

870
01:26:13,982 --> 01:26:17,024
Kind of means everything
will be half and half.

871
01:26:17,264 --> 01:26:19,443
Half bills, half love.

872
01:26:19,523 --> 01:26:20,948
Half love for me...

873
01:26:21,231 --> 01:26:23,038
Half love for the rest.

874
01:26:23,304 --> 01:26:26,302
It will be perfect. There
will be no stress from the society.

875
01:26:26,598 --> 01:26:29,189
Your parents will be happy,
my parents will be happy.

876
01:26:29,327 --> 01:26:31,102
You are crazy!

877
01:26:31,182 --> 01:26:32,369
Kind of...

878
01:26:34,902 --> 01:26:36,757
I feel good with you.

879
01:26:37,161 --> 01:26:39,247
Even I have gotten used to you.

880
01:26:40,307 --> 01:26:42,544
Look, there will never be
any sexual pressure between us...

881
01:26:42,624 --> 01:26:43,913
no stress on that front.

882
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:46,286
Neither will there ever
be any performance anxiety.

883
01:26:46,480 --> 01:26:50,801
But my heart says that every
morning I wake up I am by your side.

884
01:26:51,524 --> 01:26:52,957
I make tea for you.

885
01:26:54,369 --> 01:26:55,769
You make a mess of the house.

886
01:26:56,820 --> 01:26:58,220
That I can't help.

887
01:26:58,447 --> 01:26:59,571
I clean the mess.

888
01:26:59,803 --> 01:27:01,176
That you will have to.

889
01:27:01,256 --> 01:27:02,709
Let's stay together.

890
01:27:04,614 --> 01:27:05,661
It's perfect.

891
01:27:05,741 --> 01:27:06,807
It will be perfect.

892
01:27:06,887 --> 01:27:08,323
Let's live together.

893
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:17,699
Now that we have decided to stay together,
will you not make me meet your dad?

894
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:33,207
So you ran away from
your ring ceremony for her?

895
01:27:36,763 --> 01:27:38,362
I'm asking you.

896
01:27:41,441 --> 01:27:42,542
No dad.

897
01:27:43,496 --> 01:27:46,132
But you said you want
to settle down with her.

898
01:27:46,326 --> 01:27:49,311
Yes Dad,
I wish to settle down with her.

899
01:27:49,391 --> 01:27:51,889
But I did not run away for her.

900
01:27:52,408 --> 01:27:54,000
So who did you run away for?

901
01:27:54,988 --> 01:27:55,922
For Akshay Mittal

902
01:27:56,075 --> 01:27:56,705
What?

903
01:27:57,251 --> 01:27:58,697
You heard it right Dad.

904
01:27:59,084 --> 01:28:02,350
I ran away for Akshay.
He is not just my friend.

905
01:28:04,875 --> 01:28:05,865
I am gay.

906
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:12,147
What are you saying, Son?

907
01:28:13,441 --> 01:28:16,603
Mom, what you heard is what I said.

908
01:28:19,405 --> 01:28:21,218
I never got a chance...

909
01:28:21,564 --> 01:28:24,560
To tell you honestly what I felt.

910
01:28:24,927 --> 01:28:27,273
Dad, you never allowed
me to speak or communicate.

911
01:28:31,965 --> 01:28:34,145
You are a very good teacher Dad.

912
01:28:35,565 --> 01:28:37,357
But I could never hug you.

913
01:28:38,153 --> 01:28:42,810
I could never tell you that I am 'me'.

914
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:44,477
I'm like this only.

915
01:28:45,113 --> 01:28:48,012
The way I am, I am.

916
01:28:49,694 --> 01:28:51,783
And it id not my fault.

917
01:28:52,496 --> 01:28:54,253
Nor is it your fault.

918
01:28:56,288 --> 01:28:58,316
I was born like this.

919
01:28:59,312 --> 01:29:00,910
And I will leave the world like this.

920
01:29:06,502 --> 01:29:08,489
But who could I talk to?
Nobody listens to me.

921
01:29:08,704 --> 01:29:10,497
No one. When I went to college...

922
01:29:10,577 --> 01:29:12,833
Veer's friend became Vineet.

923
01:29:13,701 --> 01:29:15,393
When Vineet became my friend,
I felt nice.

924
01:29:15,473 --> 01:29:16,907
There was someone at
least who would listen to me.

925
01:29:16,987 --> 01:29:19,328
I really liked him dad. Like really!

926
01:29:19,408 --> 01:29:20,523
Because he used to listen to me.

927
01:29:22,095 --> 01:29:25,230
Then you said 'No Veer, no painting.
Become an MBA'.

928
01:29:25,763 --> 01:29:28,886
I said okay Sir. Yes, Sir.

929
01:29:29,689 --> 01:29:30,580
I'll do it Sir.

930
01:29:33,435 --> 01:29:36,352
He also got left behind Dad.
Vineet also got left behind.

931
01:29:37,277 --> 01:29:38,827
I became alone again.

932
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:41,167
Again I couldn't talk to anyone.

933
01:29:41,921 --> 01:29:43,914
There was nobody to listen to me.

934
01:29:47,788 --> 01:29:49,569
Because Dad you are "Sir" right?

935
01:29:49,938 --> 01:29:52,885
You command "Veer Do
this." I say "Yes, Sir".

936
01:29:53,162 --> 01:29:56,981
I'll do it Sir.
Whatever you say I will do it.

937
01:30:04,955 --> 01:30:06,543
This is what you have given him uncle.

938
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:10,153
He could never talk to you openly...

939
01:30:11,326 --> 01:30:13,219
So he started talking to himself.

940
01:30:19,659 --> 01:30:22,959
Mummy, this is Mansi. She is like me.

941
01:30:23,927 --> 01:30:25,069
I really like her.

942
01:30:25,249 --> 01:30:27,814
In the last week or so,
how she has understood me...

943
01:30:27,894 --> 01:30:30,604
you both have not in 27 years.

944
01:30:31,712 --> 01:30:34,176
And you will not even
get it in the next 27 years.

945
01:30:37,264 --> 01:30:40,143
Today I can stand in front
of you & speak honestly...

946
01:30:43,836 --> 01:30:45,430
Because she has given me
the strength and courage to do so.

947
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:51,921
Dad, till now I've lived my
life as per your rules & commands.

948
01:30:53,062 --> 01:30:54,896
And I've been very sad.

949
01:30:56,238 --> 01:30:57,795
And I'm tired.

950
01:30:58,943 --> 01:30:59,663
Now...

951
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:05,420
I will live life by my
rules and walk the path I wish.

952
01:31:06,354 --> 01:31:07,585
And maybe I'll get
happiness in doing that.

953
01:31:25,613 --> 01:31:26,565
Hi Veer...

954
01:31:26,842 --> 01:31:27,921
Surprised...

955
01:31:28,038 --> 01:31:29,557
How come you are remembering me today?

956
01:31:30,626 --> 01:31:31,299
Is Akshay there?

957
01:31:31,940 --> 01:31:33,098
Yes, very much here.

958
01:31:33,311 --> 01:31:34,403
Did you want to talk to him?

959
01:31:34,483 --> 01:31:36,450
No, no. I wish to talk to you...

960
01:31:36,987 --> 01:31:38,964
Just that it is about him.

961
01:31:39,207 --> 01:31:39,960
I dont understand?

962
01:31:41,916 --> 01:31:44,269
Will you please put
the phone on speaker mode...

963
01:31:44,349 --> 01:31:46,561
On the speaker? Ummm, okay.

964
01:31:50,999 --> 01:31:54,586
I've been trying to talk
to you for a few day now but...

965
01:31:55,644 --> 01:31:56,977
I could not garner enough courage.

966
01:31:58,148 --> 01:32:00,355
Veer listen,
we will discuss this later, please...

967
01:32:00,435 --> 01:32:03,199
No Akshay, there is no
time for discussing things now!

968
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:06,073
Please let me speak the truth today.

969
01:32:06,245 --> 01:32:07,402
Listen... Please...

970
01:32:07,482 --> 01:32:08,420
One minute.

971
01:32:09,162 --> 01:32:10,812
Veer, please speak...

972
01:32:10,935 --> 01:32:12,023
I am listening.

973
01:32:12,487 --> 01:32:13,412
Mitali...

974
01:32:14,315 --> 01:32:15,201
Go ahead...

975
01:32:15,281 --> 01:32:17,630
Akshay has been having
an affair for 4 years.

976
01:32:21,406 --> 01:32:22,700
I had a feeling.

977
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:24,955
Today you have confirmed it.

978
01:32:26,478 --> 01:32:28,394
May I know with who?

979
01:32:30,582 --> 01:32:31,230
With me.

980
01:32:31,523 --> 01:32:32,287
What?

981
01:32:35,569 --> 01:32:37,756
Mitali, I tried to
tell you a lot but...

982
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:39,477
I never could find
the strength to face you.

983
01:32:39,957 --> 01:32:40,873
I'm sorry.

984
01:32:43,611 --> 01:32:44,997
Its your life...

985
01:32:45,612 --> 01:32:47,560
Whatever decision you
feel is right, take it.

986
01:32:49,724 --> 01:32:50,167
Hello...

987
01:32:57,469 --> 01:32:58,719
Cut the call.

988
01:33:05,718 --> 01:33:07,837
What is the truth Akshay?

989
01:33:10,345 --> 01:33:12,075
I want to know it from you.

990
01:33:18,473 --> 01:33:19,965
Veer is telling the truth.

991
01:33:26,206 --> 01:33:27,634
Sorry Mitali.

992
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,151
I was running away
from you constantly...

993
01:33:31,647 --> 01:33:32,740
What could I do?

994
01:33:35,334 --> 01:33:38,164
This society,
this status, I cheated on you...

995
01:33:40,863 --> 01:33:41,970
Dad knew.

996
01:33:43,312 --> 01:33:44,495
Mine and yours, both.

997
01:33:47,803 --> 01:33:50,134
But maybe amidst their
business collaborations...

998
01:33:51,504 --> 01:33:53,545
our Emotions do not have any value.

999
01:33:57,029 --> 01:33:58,971
I tried a lot...

1000
01:34:00,598 --> 01:34:02,591
that maybe it will
all get fine in time.

1001
01:34:04,462 --> 01:34:06,288
I tried my best but...

1002
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:08,453
I didn't feel like that for you.

1003
01:34:12,516 --> 01:34:14,049
I hope you understand.

1004
01:34:18,135 --> 01:34:19,508
Yes, I do understand.

1005
01:34:23,938 --> 01:34:25,890
And if I can understand it today.

1006
01:34:26,279 --> 01:34:28,520
I would have understood
it a year ago as well.

1007
01:34:31,277 --> 01:34:33,170
You should have tried
to speak at least once to me...

1008
01:34:33,636 --> 01:34:34,732
I'm trying today.

1009
01:34:38,195 --> 01:34:39,218
Leave me.

1010
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:43,832
Just leave me. Go find your freedom.

1011
01:34:46,129 --> 01:34:48,004
And if you can...

1012
01:34:48,904 --> 01:34:50,357
just forgive me.

1013
01:35:12,023 --> 01:35:14,075
Calm down.

1014
01:35:19,612 --> 01:35:22,044
Yeah, just give it to me.

1015
01:35:24,174 --> 01:35:25,958
Who's this...?

1016
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:28,383
Well, I'll just figure it out later.

1017
01:35:28,618 --> 01:35:29,284
And?

1018
01:35:33,486 --> 01:35:36,012
- It got smashed a little.
- Yeah, a little.

1019
01:35:39,620 --> 01:35:43,017
I am not disappointed about
the smashed car of mine...

1020
01:35:43,819 --> 01:35:46,164
As disappointed am
I because of this note!

1021
01:35:46,807 --> 01:35:47,862
What is there in it?

1022
01:35:48,096 --> 01:35:51,409
That your girlfriend
shall read & tell.

1023
01:35:52,108 --> 01:35:54,262
That too loud and clear.

1024
01:35:55,265 --> 01:35:56,560
Whats the big deal, I'll read it.

1025
01:35:56,640 --> 01:36:00,988
No no, She'll read it.
Loud & Clear please.

1026
01:36:05,723 --> 01:36:07,774
I just wrote a simple sorry.

1027
01:36:08,051 --> 01:36:09,451
So read it.

1028
01:36:13,015 --> 01:36:14,002
Read it?

1029
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,642
Sure?

1030
01:36:16,722 --> 01:36:18,495
Yes. And loudly please.

1031
01:36:21,032 --> 01:36:21,957
Sorry...

1032
01:36:31,821 --> 01:36:34,004
Sorry Sister-fu***r!

1033
01:36:45,638 --> 01:36:46,752
I loved it.

1034
01:36:47,273 --> 01:36:47,987
Loved it!

1035
01:36:48,974 --> 01:36:50,470
I love such people...

1036
01:36:53,282 --> 01:36:56,569
I had taken her case so
much & finally she took mine!

1037
01:36:59,245 --> 01:37:01,542
No hard feelings brother...

1038
01:37:02,174 --> 01:37:04,250
but if she wasn't your girlfriend...

1039
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:06,220
I would have asked her out.

1040
01:37:07,211 --> 01:37:08,705
Maybe, got married to her.

1041
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,960
We are together. Sorry!

1042
01:37:13,964 --> 01:37:18,247
What the hell girl, you have broken my
heart but I'm really happy for you guys.

1043
01:37:20,636 --> 01:37:21,649
You keep this.

1044
01:37:21,834 --> 01:37:22,877
Souvenir.

1045
01:37:23,151 --> 01:37:24,375
I'll keep it buddy.

1046
01:37:24,829 --> 01:37:26,167
Close to me.

1047
01:37:27,283 --> 01:37:29,595
I wish you guys a very
beautiful future ahead.

1048
01:37:39,051 --> 01:37:45,604
(Song: Getting closer...)

1049
01:40:57,346 --> 01:40:59,231
I got the assignment.

1050
01:41:06,271 --> 01:41:07,754
I got the assignment.

1051
01:41:07,970 --> 01:41:09,681
And they gave me
dates for my exhibition.

1052
01:41:09,761 --> 01:41:13,391
Way to go.
Congratulations my princess!

1053
01:41:13,471 --> 01:41:14,986
So so proud of you.

1054
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:16,400
Tell me which bottle have you got?

1055
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:17,341
Your favourite.

1056
01:41:17,662 --> 01:41:19,477
Go freshen up. I'll set the table.

1057
01:41:19,557 --> 01:41:20,346
Okay.

1058
01:41:23,391 --> 01:41:25,237
When you ran from the Dhaba...

1059
01:41:25,461 --> 01:41:26,878
how scared were you man.

1060
01:41:26,958 --> 01:41:28,705
I was scared? Did you see your face?

1061
01:41:28,785 --> 01:41:30,199
You were in s state of deep shock.

1062
01:41:30,279 --> 01:41:31,238
Shock? On my face?

1063
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:32,836
Of course. You are a sissy.

1064
01:41:32,916 --> 01:41:34,276
Sissy No. 1.

1065
01:41:34,356 --> 01:41:36,732
I'm not a sissy. I was just worried...

1066
01:41:36,812 --> 01:41:40,192
because you were rushing me to race the car.
We could have damaged the car.

1067
01:41:40,272 --> 01:41:42,385
- So I was worried.
- Why were you so worried about the car?

1068
01:41:42,465 --> 01:41:43,737
It was Ashar's car.

1069
01:41:43,817 --> 01:41:46,573
What did I care. In any case
I wanted to teach him a lesson.

1070
01:41:46,759 --> 01:41:49,338
And remember when we reached
Palampur & lost our way.

1071
01:41:49,418 --> 01:41:51,729
And you were hyperventilating
about wanting to meet Nikki.

1072
01:41:51,809 --> 01:41:53,483
So I also rushed & slipped a road.
And lost our way.

1073
01:41:53,563 --> 01:41:56,893
Of course I wanted to see her soon.
It had ben over a month since I had seen her...

1074
01:41:56,973 --> 01:42:00,164
I wanted to grab her face & kiss it.
Hug her tightly.

1075
01:42:00,244 --> 01:42:04,012
I wanted to hold her so close to me that
she can never get away from me but...

1076
01:42:05,266 --> 01:42:07,497
she can never get away from me but...

1077
01:42:08,963 --> 01:42:10,419
but she still left me.

1078
01:42:13,065 --> 01:42:14,283
She left me.

1079
01:42:29,322 --> 01:42:30,008
Missing her?

1080
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,347
Yes, a little too much today.

1081
01:42:44,667 --> 01:42:47,467
So why are we putting up this act of
living together, an act of being happy?

1082
01:42:47,623 --> 01:42:48,779
No, no...

1083
01:42:49,288 --> 01:42:50,395
Not an act.

1084
01:42:50,604 --> 01:42:53,619
I don't know what we are doing.

1085
01:42:54,829 --> 01:42:56,498
I don't know.

1086
01:42:57,075 --> 01:43:00,700
But I...
I am really happy with you Man.

1087
01:43:02,659 --> 01:43:03,821
I don't know...

1088
01:43:06,215 --> 01:43:07,834
There is something which is...

1089
01:43:09,390 --> 01:43:11,314
Which is amiss.

1090
01:43:19,646 --> 01:43:22,143
Maybe half the love for
me & half for someone else.

1091
01:43:25,716 --> 01:43:26,551
Maybe.

1092
01:43:29,048 --> 01:43:31,135
Maybe this 'kind' of half
love has made us incomplete.

1093
01:44:30,977 --> 01:44:31,561
Hi.

1094
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:50,162
You know...

1095
01:44:52,189 --> 01:44:55,400
dad, was sending me to the UK forever.

1096
01:44:58,493 --> 01:45:00,334
Than Veer called me...

1097
01:45:03,211 --> 01:45:05,363
I couldn't stop myself from coming.

1098
01:45:09,002 --> 01:45:10,815
I'm here for you.

1099
01:45:12,392 --> 01:45:13,970
Forever?

1100
01:45:14,872 --> 01:45:16,461
Yes, for forever?

1101
01:45:17,718 --> 01:45:18,922
Forever!

1102
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:22,907
Forever.

1103
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:39,168
Okay girls, if you are
done with being sentimental...

1104
01:45:39,832 --> 01:45:42,897
I think this movements
calls for a celebration.

1105
01:45:43,748 --> 01:45:45,859
And today's party will be from Veer!

1106
01:45:47,977 --> 01:45:51,980
Mansi, why do I always give the party?

1107
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:10,831
You know something...

1108
01:46:12,111 --> 01:46:14,817
you both look nice together.

1109
01:46:16,131 --> 01:46:16,886
We know.

1110
01:46:17,523 --> 01:46:18,284
Yes.

1111
01:46:20,208 --> 01:46:22,754
But Mansi,
we aren't that bad ourselves?

1112
01:46:23,153 --> 01:46:24,071
Really?

1113
01:46:25,157 --> 01:46:25,871
Yes...

1114
01:46:26,635 --> 01:46:30,715
but you look even better
then me with Mansi.

1115
01:46:31,281 --> 01:46:32,603
I agree.

1116
01:46:33,657 --> 01:46:35,157
See if...

1117
01:46:36,094 --> 01:46:41,218
I am the need. You are the soul.

1118
01:46:45,493 --> 01:46:47,557
Mid-night Philosophy!

1119
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:51,466
But she's right man.

1120
01:46:51,546 --> 01:46:53,697
She speaks such sweet things.

1121
01:46:54,256 --> 01:46:56,141
Nothing is right.

1122
01:46:56,577 --> 01:46:59,953
Two beers down. Nikki has
become saint Nikki. Thats all!

1123
01:47:00,118 --> 01:47:01,447
Oh no, no, no, no...

1124
01:47:01,527 --> 01:47:02,236
Yes, its true.

1125
01:47:02,316 --> 01:47:05,010
No, see. I am really seious.

1126
01:47:06,747 --> 01:47:09,182
Why dont we all stay together?

1127
01:47:09,812 --> 01:47:10,462
Hmm?

1128
01:47:12,137 --> 01:47:15,395
Of course. I mean that's perfect.

1129
01:47:15,638 --> 01:47:17,562
That is so not perfect.

1130
01:47:17,727 --> 01:47:19,256
Why? Why not?

1131
01:47:19,422 --> 01:47:20,848
- No way.
- Why?

1132
01:47:21,235 --> 01:47:23,311
Because if I was
settling down with her...

1133
01:47:23,456 --> 01:47:24,328
Okay.

1134
01:47:24,632 --> 01:47:28,257
Then I wouldn't let you
come even remotely close to her.

1135
01:47:30,207 --> 01:47:31,877
Hawwww...

1136
01:47:33,367 --> 01:47:34,609
- Seriously?
- Honest dude.

1137
01:47:34,689 --> 01:47:36,639
Why complicate?
Why should I share her?

1138
01:47:37,542 --> 01:47:39,723
Fine, even I wont
share her with you now.

1139
01:47:40,043 --> 01:47:40,972
You don't have to.

1140
01:47:41,155 --> 01:47:42,882
Yes, you have lost your chance.

1141
01:47:43,070 --> 01:47:44,742
Lets forget all this...

1142
01:47:44,897 --> 01:47:47,227
and lets do bottoms up.
And celebrate!

1143
01:47:47,307 --> 01:47:48,246
Yes
!

1144
01:47:48,638 --> 01:47:50,508
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1145
01:47:56,330 --> 01:47:58,229
Lets go now. I think we
have had enough for the night.

1146
01:47:58,309 --> 01:47:59,817
I think we should head home.

1147
01:48:00,067 --> 01:48:01,362
- No.
- Lets go.

1148
01:48:01,761 --> 01:48:02,448
C'mon.

1149
01:48:03,273 --> 01:48:04,169
Too soon.

1150
01:48:04,249 --> 01:48:05,642
C'mon my love.

1151
01:48:05,722 --> 01:48:06,838
Your phone, take it.

1152
01:48:10,391 --> 01:48:13,807
Why we are going so soon?

1153
01:48:19,226 --> 01:48:21,462
- He's not coming?
- You go ahead, I'll just be back.

1154
01:48:23,345 --> 01:48:25,574
I'm downstairs come soon.

1155
01:48:29,766 --> 01:48:30,486
Hey...

1156
01:48:31,421 --> 01:48:32,279
Lets go.

1157
01:48:33,697 --> 01:48:36,542
No man, you guys go ahead.
Enjoy yourself.

1158
01:48:37,095 --> 01:48:38,529
Hey, lets go.

1159
01:48:39,813 --> 01:48:41,601
I will just have two more drinks...

1160
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:42,511
and then I'll come.

1161
01:48:42,591 --> 01:48:45,132
And its your night.
I think, you should enjoy it.

1162
01:48:45,729 --> 01:48:47,202
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

1163
01:48:48,004 --> 01:48:49,310
Okay, take care of yourself.

1164
01:49:17,014 --> 01:49:18,337
Don't do that?

1165
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:21,576
Don't go Mansi.
Be here with me.

1166
01:49:22,312 --> 01:49:24,160
Mansi. Mansi!

1167
01:49:24,631 --> 01:49:26,144
- Hello.
- Is that Ms.Mansi speaking?

1168
01:49:26,224 --> 01:49:26,902
Yes.

1169
01:49:26,982 --> 01:49:28,902
You need to urgently come
to Sharda Hospital.

1170
01:49:28,982 --> 01:49:34,905
Ma'am, your friend Veer Pratap has
been involved in a road accident.

1171
01:49:38,202 --> 01:49:39,348
Mansi, what happened?

1172
01:49:41,403 --> 01:49:43,143
Is everything okay?

1173
01:49:51,187 --> 01:49:52,440
- Doctor...
- Yes.

1174
01:49:52,834 --> 01:49:54,650
How is he now? Is he better?

1175
01:49:55,070 --> 01:49:56,447
He's alive...

1176
01:49:56,628 --> 01:49:58,315
but he is in coma.

1177
01:49:59,001 --> 01:50:02,473
He has  severe head injuries
becouse of the fall from the terrace.

1178
01:50:02,553 --> 01:50:03,586
Okay.

1179
01:50:03,859 --> 01:50:05,043
Also the blood loss.

1180
01:50:05,123 --> 01:50:09,400
Sir, I mean,
is it something very serious?

1181
01:50:09,980 --> 01:50:15,278
Yes, basically he has
Frontal Cortex Lesion.

1182
01:50:15,663 --> 01:50:18,583
He can listen to you
but he cannot respond.

1183
01:50:19,574 --> 01:50:22,825
He can hear everything but
has lost the ability to respond.

1184
01:50:22,905 --> 01:50:25,250
And Sir, how long until he comes back?

1185
01:50:32,842 --> 01:50:34,176
He needs to be taken care
of for any hope of recovery.

1186
01:50:34,375 --> 01:50:35,714
Can we go see him?

1187
01:50:35,963 --> 01:50:36,572
Yes, Sure.

1188
01:50:36,772 --> 01:50:37,443
Okay.

1189
01:51:13,310 --> 01:51:16,277
Mansi, the doctor said that...

1190
01:51:19,719 --> 01:51:20,990
Mansi...

1191
01:51:22,549 --> 01:51:25,023
the doctor was saying that...

1192
01:52:03,610 --> 01:52:05,986
'I had two options'

1193
01:52:07,249 --> 01:52:11,370
'Nikki or Veer'

1194
01:52:14,289 --> 01:52:19,089
'I chose the one which was
incomplete yet it completed me.'

1195
01:53:34,511 --> 01:53:36,128
How I am looking today.

1196
01:53:55,878 --> 01:54:01,134
'Veer had given me his share
of love & lived it as well.'

1197
01:54:02,547 --> 01:54:04,248
'Now it was my turn to reciprocate'

1198
01:54:06,424 --> 01:54:07,998
Congratulations Veer.

1199
01:54:08,691 --> 01:54:12,405
Do you know - today its
been a year since we got together.

1200
01:54:15,767 --> 01:54:18,636
Hey, dont you dare make me cry.

1201
01:54:19,457 --> 01:54:21,951
Else I will eat the entire cake alone.

1202
01:54:22,270 --> 01:54:23,847
My sentimental fool...

1203
01:54:27,713 --> 01:54:29,601
'Veer was correct in saying...'

1204
01:54:30,093 --> 01:54:32,191
'that the bodily desires
have their own weight.'

1205
01:54:32,561 --> 01:54:34,200
'That weight never burdened us'

1206
01:54:35,085 --> 01:54:38,329
'The only thing that remained
between us was love...'

1207
01:54:39,016 --> 01:54:40,051
'Friendship...'

1208
01:54:40,183 --> 01:54:41,589
'And a lot between the two'

1209
01:54:43,548 --> 01:54:46,393
'Veer always wanted
us to be living together'

1210
01:54:47,466 --> 01:54:49,343
'And now we were living together'

1211
01:54:50,265 --> 01:54:52,324
'The only difference was that...'

1212
01:54:53,113 --> 01:54:56,774
'Neither did I dirty the house now,
nor did he ever have to clean it.'
