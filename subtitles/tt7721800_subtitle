00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,010
People believe there are
only 7 stories in the world.

3
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,510
But I believe every
person has a story to tell.

4
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,810
You must think a middle-class, old man
must have led such a boring life...

5
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,970
how would you
know that I've lived...

6
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,510
a life more colorful
than my greying hair can betray.

7
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:49,880
Get it, get it, get it... dammit...

8
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,300
Mr. Robert...

9
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,946
- This is the main shop...
- This idiot again...

10
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,430
The owner is Mr. Bharat...
oh, greetings!

11
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,760
- Hello Mr. Gulati...
- Hello sir... hello!

12
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,720
This is our dear Mr. Gupta.

13
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,090
He's a big builder.

14
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:03,760
Hello...

15
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,470
This is our foreign
financer - Mr. Robert.

16
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,340
Is Mr. Bharat not around?

17
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:12,970
He's very much here...
where would he go?

18
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,170
He's in his room.

19
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,220
Bharat sir,
I'm requesting you for the last time...

20
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,680
Please have one look at these papers.

21
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,930
This is Mr. Gupta - it's his project...

22
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,260
And he thinks,
we will make a killing with this deal.

23
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,370
You will get a store twice this big...
in his gigantic mall sir!

24
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:37,860
Every shop owner in the market
has already signed Bharat sir...

25
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,430
Just you...

26
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:44,010
I mean, we need your blessings sir.

27
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,340
If you sign these papers Bharat sir,

28
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:51,260
I promise to erect an A-grade mall
in this market sir!

29
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,840
It's my challenge!

30
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,050
And excuse me sir...
I just found out,

31
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,510
it's your happy birthday tomorrow,
isn't it?

32
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,660
Mr. Gupta, don't be shy now...

33
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,980
This is Ms. Laxmi, Bharat
sir - the goddess of wealth?

34
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,510
Last night in my dream
she said -

35
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,670
"I can't live without
Bharat sir anymore!"

36
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,720
So, I've brought
her along to meet you.

37
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
Hmm?

38
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,010
Inside? You mean... in private?

39
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,800
This is nice...

40
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,760
We can speak openly now.

41
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,560
What's this? What...
what happened sir?

42
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,380
What're you doing Bharat sir?!

43
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:53,300
I'm sorry sir.
I'll never set eyes on your shop...

44
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:55,720
In fact I'll forget
about this whole market sir!

45
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,260
- Mr. Gupta!!!
- Shut up!

46
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,380
- Help, Mr. Gupta!
- What's happening inside?

47
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:00,470
Gulati is screaming...

48
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,880
Gulati is possessed
by the mall-witch...

49
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,800
He's getting exorcised.

50
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,180
I was born before this country's
independence and its partition.

51
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,010
I've lost way more
than I have earned...

52
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,630
And yet I've managed
to live a fair & honest life.

53
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:19,260
Don't you dare lure
the people here with a mall again.

54
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,050
Don't forget...

55
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,630
It doesn't matter
how old a tiger grows,

56
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,840
he never forgets how
to hunt his prey down.

57
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,260
Bharat sir,
you have your father's swear...

58
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,880
I'll die sir... let me go please...

59
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,880
You count from 10 to 0...

60
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:37,590
- He will be out. 10...
- 10.

61
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,510
- 9...
- 9.

62
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,260
- 8...
- 8.

63
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,050
- Very good.
- 7.

64
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,630
- Very good.
- 6... 5...

65
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,550
- My father would've whacked you with a broom!
- 4... 3... 2...

66
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,760
The old man has lost it...

67
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,680
- 0... and voila!
- He's lost it!

68
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,520
The old man has lost his marbles
Mr. Gupta...

69
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,930
Grab the money and run!

70
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,680
- Both the old man gone mad... run for life...
- What? What?

71
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,510
Leave me!

72
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,970
Mad people!

73
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,760
- Bloody oldies have lost it!
- Open the door.

74
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,880
- Open, you fool!
- Where are those thugs?!

75
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:08,406
- Don't ever come back!
- Where did they go?

76
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,970
Idiot! Open the door...

77
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:11,430
Vilayati... let's go.

78
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,770
- Open you fool... open!!!
- C'MON! OPEN!!!

79
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,260
- Get lost!
- Open the door...

80
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,880
If you even look at my shop again,

81
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,720
I will bury you alive, right here!

82
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,010
You messed with the wrong guy Bharat!

83
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:30,240
I won't spare you... I'll kill you.

84
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,760
Drive, you idiot...
or he'll grab my neck again!

85
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,800
Listen to me carefully...

86
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,930
Till the day I'm alive,

87
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,430
I'm not going to sell this shop...

88
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,950
And neither will
there be a mall here...

89
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,340
Do what you want about it...

90
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:51,880
Look at all this dirt...

91
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,380
Zero sense of civics,

92
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,260
and you want a damn mall?!

93
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,550
Off you go... c'mon.

94
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,130
- Bro, can I tell you something?
- Ya?

95
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,090
I think you have completely lost it...

96
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,790
Bro, I'm turning 70...

97
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:13,050
This is the age to lose it!

98
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,430
Everyone in the market is
just waiting for you to pop it.

99
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,720
You can tell them Bharat
isn't dying anytime soon.

100
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,380
- Happy birthday grandpa...
- Happy birthday grandpa...

101
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:36,550
Careful! Stop running around...
you'll hurt yourselves.

102
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:37,760
Go on.

103
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,430
Welcome home Mr. Brother-in-law!
Please grace us with your presence.

104
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,260
Hello Mr. Barrister-at-law...

105
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,800
You're turning 75 tomorrow.

106
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,550
70... not 75.

107
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,300
After 60 age literally is
just a number.

108
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,010
It's all the same.

109
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:57,800
And he is pretty much a younger
sibling of the creator himself!

110
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,930
This one, is one of a kind...

111
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,140
Uncle, are we going to
Attari station again, tomorrow?

112
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:06,680
Of course. Like we have
been for the last 15 years.

113
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,930
Here's your tea.

114
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,170
Mr. Bro-in-law...

115
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,300
People your age don't
plan birthday parties...

116
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,680
You should be
planning pilgrimages...

117
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,130
To atone for your sins...

118
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,930
Let it go man. He's a little touchy.

119
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,430
Look, we got you a gift...

120
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,380
There goes the birthday party...

121
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,260
Madam-sir... where are you?

122
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:43,090
Move, move...

123
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,260
Move man!

124
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,550
Are you blind?

125
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,010
Watch out...

126
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,760
Hold on...

127
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,740
What's wrong sexy?

128
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,450
I was the one in an accident and
you're the one who looks banged up.

129
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,030
Why do they have grumble
about my birthday?

130
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,450
I'm the birthday boy...

131
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:26,110
I should get to cut my
cake wherever I want.

132
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,780
Don't I quietly eat the awful pizza
& burgers at their birthday?

133
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,860
Do I complain?

134
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:38,610
I want to cut my birthday
cake while running

135
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,296
along a running
train at Attari station...

136
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,400
What's their problem?!
I didn't force anyone to come!

137
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,950
Bharat, old age is
turning you into a child.

138
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,530
A stubborn child who
wants everything his way.

139
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:59,070
Stop being such an
old bulb with a short fuse!

140
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,990
Okay, I'm done with my daily dose.

141
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,030
What's up with you?

142
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,860
Me?

143
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,150
I'm still a heartthrob
among the morning walkers!

144
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,400
Just day before Mr. Sharma
was whispering to his neighbor,

145
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,900
"That Kumud's body
is still so banging!"

146
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,990
Hah! I believe that...

147
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,900
I'm sure Mr. Sharma's eyes
need a thorough check up!

148
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,610
Grandpa!!!

149
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,150
- Get in fast.
- It's so early in the morning!

150
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,676
I didn't even get a decent
bowel movement...

151
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,990
I'll be constipated all day.

152
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,796
Don't worry,
I've packed a laxative for you...

153
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,530
Here's the key to the store.

154
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,650
Where's madam-sir?

155
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,570
I don't know why she's late.

156
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,570
Sorry.

157
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Here.

158
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,990
Happy birthday!

159
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,990
Your promise makes my heart beat,

160
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:58,780
this life I've lived,
feels incomplete...

161
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,650
My heart beats in pain...

162
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,990
I need you to heal this ache,

163
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,950
come back and hold me again.

164
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:15,700
Dhak-Dhak, dhak-dhak, spins my heart
I hope & pray in vain.

165
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,796
- I dream of a path that leads to you...
- Come on Bharat! Let's go.

166
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,780
But I know not what road or what lane.

167
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,860
Thap-thap, thap-thap...
lonely, beats a drum.

168
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,990
Thap-thap, thap-thap
when will my beloved come?

169
00:11:30,650 --> 00:11:32,200
The train is 4 hours late...

170
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,740
We woke up this early
on a public holiday... for this!

171
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,360
He's always going
on like a stuck record...

172
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,530
Jyoti...

173
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:43,610
Grandpa... why do we always come here
to celebrate your birthday?

174
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,110
It's not my birthday today.

175
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,110
What?!

176
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,820
When I was little,

177
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:53,490
they asked me my birth date
for school admissions...

178
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,780
But all I could
remember was that

179
00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,160
I came here to Attari station on
a train from Pakistan on 15th August.

180
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,490
So I told them...
that's my birthday!

181
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,360
But why did you come
here from Pakistan?

182
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,740
We had to come here...

183
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,410
Because at that time,

184
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:14,700
a few wise old men
in a dusty old room thought.

185
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,740
"Maybe our people will be happier
if we tear this country apart..."

186
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,070
Do you see him?

187
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,660
The white haired,
suited-booted man...

188
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,530
Walking there like 'The Godfather'.

189
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,610
He's my brother-in-law...

190
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,740
This one, is one of a kind...

191
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,110
You wanna play marbles?

192
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,950
Hey... can we also play?

193
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,450
Here.

194
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,680
- Tell me... which one should I hit?
- This one...

195
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:41,820
Grandpa, when did you learn this?

196
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,950
It's a long story my child.

197
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,910
Oh no Bharat! That's gone into
the teacher's room...

198
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,200
Let's get it back.

199
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,280
Get in... be quiet.

200
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,160
Mr. Kapoor,
the atmosphere has changed...

201
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,910
Things are quiet serious. Believe me.

202
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,740
- But...
- I just heard

203
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,890
they burnt down an entire
village between Amritsar & Lahore.

204
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,070
Hindus are not safe here anymore.

205
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,280
You need to leave for
India on the evening train.

206
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,740
Dad!

207
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,950
Dad!

208
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,570
Dad!

209
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,820
Dad!

210
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,200
Dad!

211
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,570
There he is...

212
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,710
Go ring the bell.
The train's about to come.

213
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,490
Pa, let's go to India.

214
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:46,860
What's wrong with you?

215
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:49,530
We are in India...
This is not India...

216
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,030
- India is there. Across Lahore.
- Who said this to you?

217
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,610
My teacher... he was
saying the situation is tense.

218
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,810
They're going to kill
all the Hindus here.

219
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:03,820
Don't be scared. I'm there for you.

220
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,610
You know why I named you Bharat...
after our country?

221
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,580
Why?

222
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,490
Because this is a great country.

223
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,740
It is founded on a belief
in humanity & trust.

224
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,280
Sure, they've drawn a line to tear it
into India and Pakistan right now...

225
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:22,490
But till this line doesn't
tear its people apart,

226
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,450
we will always be one. Got it?

227
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,530
Here... eat this.

228
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,280
Whenever you're feel a little
sad just eat something sweet.

229
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,070
C'mon now... your train is here.

230
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,610
Bharat! Don't go in!!!

231
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,006
- Have you packed everything?
- Are we going to make it to the station?

232
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,780
Gudiya, let's go...
pack all your toys.

233
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,910
Don't worry,
it's the last train of the day.

234
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,240
It's our last hope.

235
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,110
Bharat, take Gudiya along.

236
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,780
Hurry up!

237
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,610
- C'mon my child. Hurry up.
- Gudiya...

238
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,910
There's no space.

239
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,070
Let's look ahead.

240
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:23,360
- Brother!
- Pa... Gudiya!

241
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:25,700
- Don't let go of my hand...
- Hold her hand tight.

242
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,160
- Run Bharat.
- Pa...

243
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:34,990
Come with me... come on my child.

244
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:42,910
- Let's go ahead.
- Ya...

245
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,990
- Here.
- Here?

246
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,006
- Come here. Climb up here.
- How will we climb?

247
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,030
Just do it. Get up.

248
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,360
Bharat...

249
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,490
- You'll carry her up Bharat?
- Yes Pa.

250
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,490
That's my boy!

251
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:57,210
- Gudiya, don't let go of your brother!
- Gudiya... get on my back!

252
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,530
Hold me tight Gudiya!

253
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,780
Where are Bharat and Gudiya?

254
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,160
They are right behind.

255
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,530
Gudiya... this isn't a carnival, okay?
Don't you let go of my hand.

256
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,660
Gudiya!

257
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,860
Hurry up... get up there. Go... go!

258
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,780
My sister fell down! Help!

259
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,450
Gudiya, Gudiya...

260
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,610
Where are you Gudiya?

261
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:34,530
Gudiya?

262
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,820
Where are you Gudiya? Gudiya...

263
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:40,110
Gudiya!

264
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:42,660
- Bharat!
- Gudiya!

265
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:44,490
Where's Gudiya?

266
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,910
- Gudiya fell down...
- What?

267
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,200
I'll go get her...

268
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,070
No, I'll go. You just wait here.

269
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,410
Eye for an eye! Blood for blood!

270
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,200
Listen to me... you need to look after
everyone, till I don't come back.

271
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,240
Your aunt has a shop - Hind Ration Store
in Delhi, near the refugee camps...

272
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,110
Go straight there.
I'll meet you there.

273
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,410
Bharat, there are bonds
of blood & bonds to your land.

274
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,410
You are blessed with both my child.

275
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,990
Listen to me...

276
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,450
Rioters! We need to go!

277
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:21,860
Promise me...

278
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:23,700
You'll look after everyone?

279
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:26,240
I will Pa... I promise.

280
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,570
Just remember... Hind Ration Store.

281
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,716
- Yes Pa.
- Ration store...

282
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,280
I'll see you there, with Gudiya.

283
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:32,836
You are the eldest.
Look out for everyone.

284
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,570
- Yes Pa...
- Don't forget - Hind Ration Store.

285
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
I'll come there.

286
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,360
- Be careful.
- Gudiya... Gudiya!

287
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,490
- The train is about to leave...
- Gudiya!

288
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,100
Call your father.

289
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,090
Pa!

290
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,720
Gudiya!

291
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,990
I've told you so many times...
don't drink at the shop!

292
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,570
What's your problem?!

293
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,580
You are not the only
one who's lost his land...

294
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,570
If you can't help me out,
at least don't mess around at my shop!

295
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,700
Your shop?!

296
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,950
Did your father give you this
shop in dowry?

297
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,030
I sold everything I had
to start this shop...

298
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,240
Do you want me
to go beg on the streets?

299
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,410
Aunty.

300
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,070
Namaste!

301
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,010
Use this as a sheet...

302
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,690
The place is small,
we will sleep outside.

303
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,670
What're you doing?

304
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,410
This isn't a bloody hotel!

305
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,546
We barely have any space...
and now these people will squat here!

306
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,760
Can you speak softly please?!

307
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,840
Let them hear it.

308
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:57,350
They are my brother's children...
I can't throw them out!

309
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,430
Gau... Gautam?!

310
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,230
Your father's name is Gautam?

311
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,650
Ya.

312
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,230
My father's name was Mukhtar.

313
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,150
You're a Muslim?

314
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,230
Ya.

315
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,730
Why didn't you go to Pakistan?

316
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Why should we?

317
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,730
This is our land...

318
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,650
We will stay here.

319
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,570
My father died fighting
for India's freedom...

320
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:40,320
But they burnt our house
and shop when the riots broke out.

321
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,270
Do you want to eat some sweets?

322
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,940
Ya... but I don't have any money.

323
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,360
Neither do I...

324
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:57,230
But I know how to get some.

325
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:59,690
The stuff looks right to me...

326
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,190
Here, 25 cents.

327
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,360
25 cents?!

328
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,650
The store sells it for 1 buck!

329
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,570
Maybe it does...

330
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,270
But now these are stolen goods.

331
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,270
So you will get what we give you.
Understood?

332
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,190
Now get lost!

333
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,190
- Give it back.
- Dude, what are you doing?

334
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,190
I don't want to sell it.

335
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:17,046
- And you think we'll just let you...?!
- Leave it!

336
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,480
Just one minute!

337
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,770
Just a minute... just one minute!

338
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,730
Bharat, what are you doing?

339
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,520
At the store...
these guys treat us with respect...

340
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,690
But now that we are thieves,

341
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:34,440
this blanket has stripped
us of our respect.

342
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,690
Blanket... respect?
What do you mean?

343
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,940
I mean,
I don't care if I'm starving...

344
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,270
But I am not going to steal.

345
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:44,980
What?

346
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,690
Dude! What did you do?

347
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,820
These guys are going to beat us now.

348
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,940
At least we'll make some off it?

349
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,610
Hey!

350
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,270
We're not selling.

351
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,690
What you gonna do?

352
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:13,150
Get the little rascals!

353
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,010
What happened to your face?

354
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,140
I stole a blanket
from aunty's store...

355
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:30,890
But then I decided not to sell it...

356
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:33,930
So those guys beat me up.

357
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,010
Ma... you hate me, no?

358
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,100
Why would I hate you?

359
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,010
Because of me...

360
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,350
Gudiya and dad -

361
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,260
That wasn't your fault, Bharat!

362
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,890
All kids are dear to a mother.

363
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:03,890
By god's grace, at
least we survived those riots.

364
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:07,010
Instead of wallowing in guilt...

365
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,350
Think about the promise you
made to your Pa.

366
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:12,430
That you will always
keep this family together.

367
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,680
And the next time you know that you
are doing the right thing...

368
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:19,990
Don't just take a beating...
give it back.

369
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,850
My mother's words struck
me like a bolt of lightning.

370
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:29,220
Now my life only had one mission...

371
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,270
to fulfil the
promise I made to Pa.

372
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:33,890
To always keep this family together.

373
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,010
I decided I was going to work hard...

374
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,390
and do whatever it takes,

375
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,260
to keep this family together,

376
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,300
till the day Pa and
Gudiya come back.

377
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,050
We had a job...

378
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:54,470
But no job satisfaction.

379
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,680
But one day, everything changed...

380
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,800
When I saw Vilayati's dumbstruck face.

381
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:06,100
And this electric effect
was simply from watching

382
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:10,260
the road-side
circus queen - Radha.

383
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:14,850
This was the start
of my teenage years...

384
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,590
And who doesn't know how
complicated this time can be!

385
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,640
Vilayati kept staring at Radha...

386
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,550
And Radha couldn't stop staring at me.

387
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,050
But the biggest complication was

388
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,890
how that Jimmy kept staring at
all 3 of us!

389
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,430
Money?

390
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,600
I don't have any.

391
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,390
I have money...
I have his money too.

392
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,470
Take this...

393
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,680
And this...

394
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,430
Take it all.

395
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,440
What is mine... is yours. Okay?

396
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,490
Can we get a job in the circus?

397
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:04,970
You have to put your
life on the line...

398
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,720
We can do that.

399
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:10,140
I can do that too...

400
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,630
For you.

401
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,640
And I can break your teeth.

402
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,970
As time passed by,
that roadside act turned into...

403
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:26,660
North India's biggest circus...

404
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,220
Welcome to The Great Russian Circus!

405
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:38,430
And the show runner of this crazy
world was Vilayati.

406
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:45,300
His entry style of appearing inside
an egg on stage got so famous that

407
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:52,180
a young boy sitting in
the audience used it in his film...

408
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,550
And went on to become the country's

409
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,930
biggest movie star.

410
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,930
You must have seen everything by now

411
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,800
but have you ever seen the...

412
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,050
Flying motorcycle?

413
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:14,350
Roaring through flames,

414
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,720
with his life on the line.

415
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,930
We bring to you...

416
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,180
This evening's star,

417
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:27,140
my dear friend

418
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,600
and the show-stopper
of The Great Russian Circus...

419
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:35,530
BHARAT!!!

420
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:58,220
Big round of applause!

421
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,640
He's put his life in danger...
just for you.

422
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,760
And now...
married men, close your eyes,

423
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:09,260
cause here she comes
the love of my life.

424
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:12,850
My Juliet... my Helen of Troy...
My Radha!

425
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,600
Put your hands together...

426
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,550
Did you think that was it?!

427
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:44,390
The evening has just
begun my friends...

428
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,720
Presenting now...
The Well of Death!

429
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:59,140
- Madam...
- What's up?

430
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,260
Who's a safer bet?

431
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:02,800
Bharat usually wins dude...
but even Jimmy's pretty good.

432
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,550
20 bucks... on Bharat!

433
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,970
- 20?
- Ya... Madam, here's my money...

434
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:16,850
Bharat's opponent in the Well of
Death will be the (RASCAL) daredevil

435
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,850
Jimmy!

436
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,350
You are going to win Jimmmy!

437
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,260
You are going to lose today... again!

438
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,970
I'm going to make your Bharat cry...
just you watch!

439
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:38,800
Terrific!
Everyone's betting on Bharat...

440
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,600
But even Jimmy could win.

441
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,930
But don't you guys worry...

442
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:45,550
You can change
your minds in the middle of the race!

443
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,440
Of course...
it'll cost you two times more.

444
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:55,100
Here comes my Bharat!

445
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,720
C'mon Jimmy!

446
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,930
Radha, my darling,
wave that kerchief...

447
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,010
And let's see
who will be the winner!

448
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:13,100
Come on, come on Bharat!

449
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,100
Dude, the race has started...

450
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,100
- C'mon... let's go! Hurry, hurry.
- Run, run, run...

451
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:30,430
My brother rides like one of
those superstars.

452
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,180
Where is he?

453
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,190
There he is... in the white jacket.

454
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,890
Looks like Jimmy is going to beat
Bharat today.

455
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,390
What are you saying madam?!

456
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,680
You said Bharat will win...
so we bet on Bharat!

457
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,800
- Ya, even I bet on him.
- So, now bet on Jimmy?!

458
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,430
Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy Jimmy...

459
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,100
Bharat! My brother!

460
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,380
Oh! That rascal Jimmy
has blocked his silencer!

461
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,890
Hurry up Bharat... pull it out.

462
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,970
There's a car coming...

463
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,800
Pull!

464
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,720
Pull it out Bharat!

465
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,680
Bharat! Bharat!

466
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,100
The undisputed king
of the Well of Death...

467
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,100
Bharat!

468
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:42,570
This night, full of glitz and glam,

469
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:46,970
feels like a movie scene.

470
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:51,310
I'm your hero, you're my heroine...

471
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:55,640
On the shiny silver screen.

472
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:02,180
Our story, full of twists and turns...

473
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,700
Is full of this sweet emotion...

474
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:13,100
Your eyes are a deep blue ocean...
I drown in sweet slow motion.

475
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:21,850
Your eyes are a deep blue ocean...
I drown in sweet slow motion.

476
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:28,470
This night, full of glitz and glam,

477
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:32,600
feels like a movie scene.

478
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:37,120
You're the king of swagger...
and I'm your classy queen.

479
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:41,560
You're the king of swagger...

480
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:47,510
Cause tonight baby,
the mood is right...

481
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:51,640
It's full of that sweet emotion.

482
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:58,600
Your eyes are a deep ocean...
where I drown in slow motion.

483
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:07,220
Your eyes are a deep ocean...
where I drown in slow motion.

484
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,720
With a bigass diamond ring...

485
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,930
Your heart, I'm gonna win.

486
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:01,810
With a bigass diamond ring...
your heart, I'm gonna win.

487
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:06,220
Gonna be your baby-daddy...
can't wait to change its napkin!

488
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:10,640
Gonna tell my mum & dad...
be ready for that meeting.

489
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,010
While the sun is setting...
gonna have that perfect wedding!

490
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:19,000
On the moon, pretty soon...
we gonna have a honeymoon.

491
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:25,430
It's time our relationship
get's that next promotion...

492
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:32,670
Your eyes are a deep ocean...
where I drown in slow motion.

493
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,390
Your eyes are a deep ocean...
where I drown in slow motion.

494
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:44,720
In slow motion.

495
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:53,970
In slow motion.

496
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:07,850
In love we are slaves
to the heart's oppression...

497
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,010
In slow motion.

498
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:17,390
Your eyes are a deep ocean...

499
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:24,430
Where I drown in slow motion.

500
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,750
Brother!

501
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,070
Brother!

502
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,720
I'll do anything else, but I won't
do this daredevilry again...

503
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,850
I had to do this
to feed my family,

504
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,030
but these idiots think
I'm some kind of hero.

505
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,470
Can you imagine
how many boys out there

506
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,776
must be trying
to repeat such stunts on the roads...

507
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,300
And getting their bones broken?!

508
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:04,720
He's lost his mind!

509
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,510
Radha, can you talk
some sense into him?

510
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,800
There are no jobs waiting
for us out there.

511
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,390
Our families will starve to death!

512
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,970
This is our only skillset!

513
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,100
Junior's broken leg scared you,
didn't it?

514
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:25,640
It could have been you instead...

515
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,970
You're worried about the
promise you made to your Pa.

516
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,640
To look after everyone...

517
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:42,100
You should do what you think is right.

518
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,390
I'll miss you Radha.

519
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,970
Don't you worry about me...

520
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,970
You're only leaving the circus;
It's no big deal.

521
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,180
Maybe I'll find a better partner.

522
00:39:03,430 --> 00:39:05,930
It's just bad luck I guess...

523
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,640
My parents named me Radha after Lord
Krishna's lover.

524
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,550
As the story goes...

525
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,850
Radha never ends up with her love.

526
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,760
I gave up my job,
quite sentimentally...

527
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,100
But our country wasn't doing so well.

528
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,220
And the lines outside the employment
exchanges were miles long.

529
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:59,760
Vilayati and I would spend the whole
day outside the exchange...

530
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,800
But the scene at home had turned into
a tragic black and white film.

531
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:07,930
There was always a sad violin
playing in the background...

532
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,390
And shouting matches in foreground!

533
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:15,140
Mehek was 24 now,

534
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,010
and she had been
bitten by the marriage bug.

535
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,400
Find me a boy!!!

536
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,600
Mehek would hold her breath
till she turned blue...

537
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,140
She wanted a groom
like Prime Minister Nehru.

538
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,140
Mom would signal me to check if
Vilayati wanted to marry Mehek.

539
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:47,850
Because he resembled PM Nehru a lot!

540
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,680
He's just like Mr. Nehru!

541
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,180
But I loved Vilayati...

542
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:03,760
I couldn't destroy his life like that!

543
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,640
Put the goods in the godown.

544
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,100
Hello uncle!

545
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,300
And then one day,

546
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,100
when we were
working at the shop...

547
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,850
We heard Mehek scream!

548
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,430
Nooooo!

549
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,640
All time had come to a stop.

550
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,760
PM Nehru was no more.

551
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:35,510
Years went by as we stood
in line at the exchange.

552
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,930
- Then one day...
- Bharat!

553
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,140
You won't believe me!

554
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,760
Vilayati appeared before me,

555
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,800
in the form of the
goddess of employment.

556
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,930
Bharat!

557
00:41:49,170 --> 00:41:51,470
Bro...

558
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,930
They've struck oil in
the Middle East...

559
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,010
Hundreds of jobs!

560
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,800
Let's go!

561
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,930
Let's go!

562
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,140
Bharat!

563
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,010
Bro...

564
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:24,510
Bharat!

565
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,550
Jobs are on offer...
oil in the Middle East!

566
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:29,600
They need people. Come on!

567
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,100
Are you slow or plain stupid?

568
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,246
Just because they have found oil there
doesn't mean, you can suck us dry here!

569
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:38,326
- Someone's getting their ass handed to them!
- It's a digging job... not a bloody circus routine.

570
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:41,076
You don't have a day's experience
doing a thing and you want this job?!

571
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,520
You are being disrespectful!

572
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,690
That is all the respect you deserve...

573
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,730
Don't you take a woman
in a saree lightly.

574
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,560
Now scoot to the nearest exit,

575
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:52,020
because if I have to
get up from this chair,

576
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,020
I'll make sure you are never
able to sit your ass down on one!

577
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:58,310
Bro, I'm too old to
get whopped by a girl.

578
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,560
- Why?
- No way.

579
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,940
Out you go!

580
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,850
It's like she's spewing
chillies instead of words...

581
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:11,980
All I can hear,
is sweet, sweet potion...

582
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,870
What do you want?

583
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,440
We wanted to meet Kumud sir...

584
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,980
I'm Kumud... what do you want?

585
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:24,980
So Kumud sir is actually...

586
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:26,980
Kumud madam-sir!

587
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,100
We've heard they struck
oil in Middle East...

588
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,640
So you want an oil massage?

589
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,690
The oil was found 3 years ago...

590
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:40,980
Get to the point.

591
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:43,206
We want to make an application...
for the oil digging job.

592
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,440
So just say that no?

593
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,690
Why this elaborate back story...

594
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,600
Name and age?

595
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:50,980
Syed Vilayati Salim
Yousuf Ataullah Khan.

596
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,980
Just the name please...

597
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:54,600
Not your address.

598
00:43:58,770 --> 00:43:59,940
It's my name only...

599
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:02,770
Along with my
forefathers' names.

600
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,810
Are they coming along to dig oil?

601
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:07,560
I want the short version!

602
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,880
Just Vilayati Khan should be fine.

603
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,310
Age...

604
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:13,980
You can round it off at 30.

605
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,980
Mine? I'm Bharat...

606
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,640
Bharat... what?

607
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
Bharat...

608
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,440
30.

609
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:24,640
What's your full name?

610
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,560
Kumar... Khan? Singh? D'mello?

611
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,100
My father named me Bharat...
after our country's name.

612
00:44:32,390 --> 00:44:35,440
If I were to fix a
surname after Bharat,

613
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,890
it would belittle
this country's name and its stature.

614
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:39,980
Bravo!

615
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,100
Mr. Bharat...

616
00:44:45,470 --> 00:44:48,980
This isn't the office to
file your nomination for the election.

617
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,600
This is a teeny-tiny
employment exchange...

618
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,230
And the job that you are applying for,

619
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:00,310
has no use for these
patriotic speeches.

620
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,940
Yes, madam-sir.

621
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,020
Now tell me, have you worked before?

622
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,390
Do you have any experience?

623
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:10,020
We are labor!

624
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:12,980
Oh... so you are laborers!

625
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,350
Mr. Mishra... that's your department.

626
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,980
Take their details, and call
them for a medical test tomorrow.

627
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,810
Even the bloody labor in
this country wants to give speeches!

628
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,140
Oil extraction requires teamwork...

629
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:29,770
So all of you will
be divided into teams.

630
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,850
And the teams that perform the best,

631
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,176
- will be sent to the Middle East.
- Stand straight you 2!

632
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,390
TEAM NUMBER 1:

633
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:38,060
Sunil Singh, Devraj,

634
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,020
Mohammad Shami... TEAM NUMBER 2:

635
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:42,730
Bharat,

636
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,390
Shut up and pay attention.
Or I'll make sure you fail in no time.

637
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,940
Vilayati Khan,

638
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,560
Mohammad Ali... Yes madam.

639
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,730
Zalzala Singh... That's me.

640
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:55,020
Roli Rawat... Yes ma'am.

641
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,060
Rajshekhar Yadav...
I'm Yadav, madam.

642
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:02,520
Come on... start warming up.

643
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,060
Aha... here comes the
gold medalist team!

644
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:16,350
I think we will get
buried in the hole we dig.

645
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,480
We're doomed!

646
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,810
Next. Weight lifting.

647
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:29,140
Uncle...

648
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,270
Come on!

649
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:36,270
Pick it up!

650
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,600
Well done...

651
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,850
He's done it!

652
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:43,930
Pass!

653
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:45,790
Pass!

654
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:48,620
Next!

655
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,980
- Good morning to all.
- I bet he can't lift his own finger.

656
00:46:55,890 --> 00:47:00,560
Well done... come on, come on!

657
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:03,670
Fail!

658
00:47:03,750 --> 00:47:04,750
Next!

659
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,100
- He can do it.
- 1... 2... 3!

660
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:12,350
He can do it!

661
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:13,690
Pick it up!

662
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:17,310
He can.

663
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:23,520
- He's useless!
- Bharat, Bharat!

664
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:25,190
Fail!

665
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:32,350
- I did it!
- Vilayati... you've failed!

666
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,350
Next!

667
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,140
Look Chaurasia...

668
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,520
He's like a real life Hercules!

669
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,310
5 ft 3 inches...

670
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,350
Take it off.
Hurry up. Good. Get going.

671
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,520
0 kgs?!

672
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,730
Take a few deep breaths!

673
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:12,520
Up, up... down, down... good!

674
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,270
35 kgs...

675
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,480
6 ft...

676
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,060
No, 5 ft 7 inches?

677
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,310
5 ft 9 and a half inches?

678
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:30,520
Okay... 5 ft 9 and a half inches!

679
00:48:30,790 --> 00:48:31,940
This way.

680
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,230
Take it off please.

681
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:36,940
What a physique!

682
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,590
Come.

683
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,310
70 kgs.

684
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,100
Shall we say 76 and a half?

685
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,560
76.5!

686
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:51,820
This way.

687
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,270
It's really hot Mr. Chaurasia.

688
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:56,690
5 ft...

689
00:48:56,770 --> 00:48:58,406
"We decided" it was 5 ft
7 and a half inches, no?

690
00:48:58,430 --> 00:49:01,270
Err... 5 ft 7 and a half inches, sold!

691
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:02,480
Take it off.

692
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,270
Can we switch on the fan?

693
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,110
It's right behind you.
Switch it on yourself.

694
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:08,560
Leave it there...

695
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,980
No one's going to steal it!

696
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:12,520
Go on. It's not that precious!

697
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:22,980
Oh man... I can breathe now.

698
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,100
Cool...

699
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,270
Hey, stop... wait, wait! My undies.

700
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,060
What a tragedy!

701
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,880
Mr. Chaurasia, please fetch my undies.

702
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,020
I'm not touching anyone's undies!
Get it yourself!

703
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:44,100
Not feeling hot anymore?

704
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,060
Gimme your hand...
grab it with your leg.

705
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:56,520
Come on!

706
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,810
Make a scissor with your toes!

707
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:07,850
Just a little more!

708
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:15,890
The undie is home!

709
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,810
Is my name there Bharat?

710
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:34,730
- Nope.
- Huh?

711
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,270
Bharat... see if I'm there?!

712
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,640
None of our names are there.

713
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:40,100
What are you doing man?!

714
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:41,996
- Mohammad Ali... I must be there.
- Not there!

715
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,020
No?

716
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,520
None of us got through.

717
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,440
Sir, I'll take the selected men
to the Middle East next week.

718
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:51,100
This is batch no. 32.
Please sign here.

719
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,440
Sir, we want to talk to you.

720
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:55,850
Tell me?

721
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,600
Sir, why is our name not in this list?

722
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,480
Sir, they cleared their medical,

723
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:02,600
but the entire team
flunked the physical test.

724
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,730
Only this Bharat has a decent... body.

725
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,100
I mean... Vilayati Khan
couldn't even lift the sack.

726
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,640
Madam is right.

727
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:13,350
These boys are rubbish!

728
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,480
Rubbish?

729
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:19,100
Madam-sir, actually I don't
exercise my upper body so much!

730
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,190
I mean I do sit-ups. Legs... thighs...

731
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:25,190
Look brother...

732
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,190
We need only 90 men.

733
00:51:29,490 --> 00:51:31,560
You guys can try next time.

734
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:32,890
Next time meaning?

735
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,190
Next time meaning... 6 months later!

736
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:37,140
6 months?!

737
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,020
What will we do for 6 months?

738
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:40,690
Sir, 6 months is too long.

739
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,536
This country is changing
every moment now.

740
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:46,520
More than half this nation is unfit,

741
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,480
what are they supposed to do?

742
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:51,640
What happens to that kid in the classroom
who barely scores passing marks?!

743
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:54,140
We need to change
the way we think sir.

744
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,690
That's why we all need
to go to the Middle East,

745
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,270
so we can earn money in dollars.

746
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:02,350
We can send these dollars home...

747
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,520
These dollars will bring progress...

748
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:06,310
And progress will bring prosperity...

749
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,060
And sir prosperity
will bring good roads,

750
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:10,520
good hospitals,
good schools & colleges...

751
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:12,390
Good education will end poverty...

752
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,600
And instead of laborers like us there will
be engineers, doctors and scientists...

753
00:52:16,690 --> 00:52:18,290
It will also increase
farmers' produce...

754
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,390
Slums will turn into apartments,

755
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,440
our country will
be clean and beautiful...

756
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,666
The people will be happy... which will

757
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:27,190
make this country even greater...

758
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:30,350
And then our people
will be proud to say...

759
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,880
Say what?

760
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:50,020
(STARTS SINGING THE
INDIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM)

761
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:34,640
Long live Mother India!

762
00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:35,940
Mother India!

763
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,480
Long live... The revolution!

764
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,310
My god! These boys are real patriots!

765
00:53:41,730 --> 00:53:45,100
You all will go to the Middle East.

766
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,730
Where's my stamp?!

767
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:54,480
In the whirling depths of my heart
lies my ship, night and day...

768
00:53:55,490 --> 00:54:01,740
I dive into this whirlpool, oh lord...
Hold my hand, I pray...

769
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:04,730
Bharat bro, the desert has turned
madam-sir into Marilyn Monroe!

770
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:08,170
Alive, you beat inside me...

771
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:12,030
And in you, I live and die.

772
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,850
Like a phoenix I will rise,

773
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,690
to break these chains and fly.

774
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:21,600
Soon we realized that
we weren't the only ones here...

775
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:26,020
just like us many Pakistani,
Sri Lankan and Filipino...

776
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:31,270
laborers also worked in this scorching
desert to feed their families back home.

777
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:32,866
- There's no food left.
- No food left?

778
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:33,890
Ya.

779
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,480
No problem. We can share...

780
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,020
- You will share?
- I mean Bharat can share...

781
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:40,690
Or someone else.

782
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:44,480
Praise the lord!

783
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,520
Pull Vilayati, pull!

784
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,810
Careful Zalzala!

785
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:50,440
Blessed be thy name!

786
00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:52,190
Attaboy, we've done it!

787
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:54,590
- Yes uncle...
- Ya. Keep your hand to yourself.

788
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:57,920
To break these chains and fly.

789
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,250
Alive, you beat inside me...

790
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:04,760
And in you, I live and die.

791
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:07,940
I'm okay Ma.

792
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,480
How are Junior and Mehek?

793
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,100
They are okay. I'm also okay.

794
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:15,480
We have found us a house...
when will you send the money?

795
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:17,510
I'll send it by the
end of the month...

796
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:23,190
Listen to me... you need to look after
everyone, till I don't come back.

797
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,980
Promise me...
you'll look after everyone?

798
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:29,620
Alive, you beat inside me...

799
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,560
And in you, I live and die.

800
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,290
Like a phoenix I will rise,

801
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:41,250
to break these chains and fly.

802
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,190
Vilayati! Come down... right now!

803
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,390
Leave it, get down here.

804
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:53,770
Bharat!

805
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,660
Bharat!

806
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,310
Everyday, the same bloody nonsense!

807
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:03,790
How can the food be over everyday?!

808
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:05,410
Look man,
we are just workers like you.

809
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,520
If you have a problem
take it up with the supervisor.

810
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:08,980
We toil all day in this heat,

811
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,230
I can't work on an empty stomach...

812
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,080
Why are they never short of food?

813
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:15,286
We've told them so many times.
They always have enough.

814
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:17,166
A lot of it goes waste...
but they never send it here.

815
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:18,190
Why don't you tell them?

816
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,940
Let's go there and eat.

817
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,310
Hey, hey... what are you doing here?

818
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:32,386
- This is not your food.
- Food finish.

819
00:56:32,410 --> 00:56:34,100
Anyway, you cannot eat here.

820
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:35,190
- Hungry.
- Go there.

821
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,920
- Don't you touch me!
- Aye, don't touch me.

822
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,770
Don't push.

823
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:46,270
He's my friend.

824
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:47,640
What happened?

825
00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:49,310
He pushed me.

826
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,860
- Sir, let me explain... basically this...
- Let him speak.

827
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,230
Sir, we get curry &

828
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:57,980
rice...

829
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:00,480
Every day it gets over.

830
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,020
They get meat,

831
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:03,690
vegetables,

832
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,480
even sweets...

833
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,640
Their food never gets over.

834
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,980
Why?

835
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,270
Because we are Indian, Pakistani,

836
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,440
Sri Lankan, Filipino...

837
00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:16,900
Our colour is different,

838
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,790
we don't speak the same language.

839
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:21,750
Not good.

840
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,160
Bharat, that's enough.

841
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:26,130
- Basically what he's trying to say...
- Let him finish.

842
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,270
Sir,

843
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:33,890
you are supervisors...
you know a well-oiled

844
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:36,700
machine does good work.

845
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,840
It never stops...

846
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,520
Similarly, if you give us proper food

847
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:42,610
we won't stop.

848
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,440
We'll give our best.

849
00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:51,480
That's all sir...

850
00:57:55,810 --> 00:57:57,600
Would you have died
if you didn't get curry?

851
00:57:57,890 --> 00:57:59,290
God knows what they'll do with him!

852
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,600
He's here...

853
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,380
He's here...

854
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,190
Bharat, is everything okay?

855
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,730
Do we still have our job?

856
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,560
Shall we pack our bags?

857
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:17,560
Everyone gets the
same food from tomorrow.

858
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,730
I won't be hungry anymore...

859
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:28,190
Same food for everyone.

860
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:29,310
Bharat!

861
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:36,560
Bharat... Bharat... Bharat...

862
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,310
Bharat! What was that?

863
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,770
What?

864
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:43,690
He's a very senior officer...

865
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:47,560
He could cancel
our entire contract in 2 minutes.

866
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:50,456
You and all these workers will have
to go back home and start begging!

867
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:51,640
Sorry madam-sir...

868
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:53,640
I just said what I was feeling.

869
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,270
- Your feeling?
- Ya.

870
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:58,980
And when are you going to
talk about your real feelings?

871
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,520
Sorry madam...

872
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:06,440
Feelings, my foot...

873
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,190
What feeling was she talking about?

874
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:16,350
You're a moron. Let's go guys...

875
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,770
The festival of Diwali is here.

876
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,980
Come on uncle,
let's talk to madam-sir...

877
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,980
If she can allow us to
organize some festivities?

878
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,206
Who's going to talk to her?

879
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:28,390
I will... Shut up!

880
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:31,100
I think she will listen to Bharat...

881
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:32,940
He can convince her. I know it.

882
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,310
- Is it?
- Ya.

883
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,890
After today's ruckus,
I'm steering clear of her.

884
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:38,760
She's in love with you, my boy.

885
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:40,730
Don't you also feel it?

886
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,326
We have all seen it?
What say boys?

887
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,730
- Oh yes!
- I've seen it.

888
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:48,060
You don't have to be the silent,
shy hero!

889
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,520
I've written a poem for you...

890
00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:53,440
These pretty girls,

891
00:59:54,350 --> 00:59:56,440
they like boys who are bold!

892
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:58,480
Ya, like me.

893
00:59:58,690 --> 01:00:00,190
Don't mess with my head guys.

894
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,810
I don't want to head
home before my visa expires!

895
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:04,310
My years of experience say,

896
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,140
you need a little 'extra help'...

897
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,480
A dose of the truth-tonic.

898
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Who is it?

899
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:22,440
Madam!

900
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:24,940
It's Bharat...

901
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,030
Sorry.

902
01:00:38,190 --> 01:00:41,980
Everybody was wondering if we can
get a holiday for Diwali tomorrow...

903
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:45,730
We could
organize some festivities...

904
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:48,480
Okay. I'll talk to the supervisor.

905
01:00:50,030 --> 01:00:51,030
Okay.

906
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:54,570
Anything else?

907
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,190
No...

908
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,940
"These pretty girls,
they like boys who are bold!"

909
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,070
Madam-sir...

910
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:07,570
Whenever I see you,
I see a graceful white tigress...

911
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:09,110
The rarest beast!

912
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:12,610
When I hear your voice, it's like the
melody of...

913
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:14,030
water falling on rocks.

914
01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:20,230
My eyes seem like
stars twinkling in the night sky?

915
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:20,980
Yes!

916
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:23,690
And my hair feels like
the morning breeze...

917
01:01:23,770 --> 01:01:24,420
Yes!

918
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:29,900
It feels like a million
birds flying towards the sun...

919
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:34,230
But how did you

920
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:39,210
know the rest?

921
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:42,210
Because uncle recited this
poem for me on the plane...

922
01:01:42,300 --> 01:01:44,260
Uncle?! Et tu Brute?

923
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:48,550
And I told him to
find someone his own age...

924
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,210
Before I throw him off the plane.

925
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:54,340
Now tell me what you want to.

926
01:01:57,550 --> 01:01:59,420
My family and I...

927
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,630
Came to India from Pakistan
after the partition...

928
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:08,460
But my father and little sister

929
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,670
couldn't get on the train.

930
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:19,340
Madam-sir, this watch...

931
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,800
This is my father's watch...

932
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:27,010
It doesn't work.

933
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:29,840
For years now.

934
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,460
But when I look at it...

935
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,170
I wonder

936
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:42,380
how my father and sister are.

937
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:45,880
And then

938
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:48,510
you came into my life...

939
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,630
Now when I don't see you,

940
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,550
I can't help

941
01:02:56,170 --> 01:02:57,880
but wonder

942
01:02:58,610 --> 01:02:59,670
what you must be doing?

943
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,840
Got it...

944
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:04,300
So you see your father in me?!

945
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:06,760
No madam-sir...

946
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:10,760
You are different.

947
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,800
Father always said,

948
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,050
whenever you feel sad,

949
01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:17,960
just eat something sweet.

950
01:03:18,370 --> 01:03:21,590
You are the sweet I needed
in my bitter & sour life.

951
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,380
You are my sweet potion.

952
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,260
Sweet like honey...

953
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:40,050
Sweet like honey...

954
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,960
Sweet like honey...

955
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:52,920
This evening,
bland without your voice to savor...

956
01:03:53,950 --> 01:04:01,590
Without you, this life,
is a life without any flavor.

957
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:08,960
For the sake of our love,
I beg and pray...

958
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:17,460
Give me a taste of your sweet dreams,
night & day...

959
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:22,090
You are... you are...

960
01:04:23,010 --> 01:04:29,840
You are... you are...
the sweet potion of love...

961
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:33,050
The sweet potion of love...

962
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,960
Sweet like honey...
my potion of love.

963
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:42,630
The warmth of the sun, I don't need...

964
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:46,630
Let the moon not
shine its light above...

965
01:04:46,710 --> 01:04:52,760
All I want is you,
my sweet potion of love.

966
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,920
You're my sweet potion of love.

967
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,630
Sweet like honey...

968
01:05:00,210 --> 01:05:01,630
Sweet like honey...

969
01:05:15,090 --> 01:05:21,920
Just the thought of you,
gives my words more meaning...

970
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:29,760
Just the sight of you...
leaves me with a lovely feeling...

971
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,090
You are my one true desire...

972
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:37,210
My one great longing,

973
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,010
when I long for you,

974
01:05:41,960 --> 01:05:45,960
I find a sense of belonging.

975
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:49,840
You are... you are...

976
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,800
You are... you are...
the sweet potion of love...

977
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,920
The sweet potion of love...

978
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,090
The sweet potion of love...

979
01:06:07,210 --> 01:06:10,090
Uncle, we have a man down!

980
01:06:10,290 --> 01:06:12,560
Man? I think the woman
has fallen for him too!

981
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:20,920
All I want is you,
my sweet potion of love.

982
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:24,550
Sweet like honey... you're
my sweet potion of love.

983
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:31,460
Sweet like honey...

984
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:37,400
You're my sweet potion of love.

985
01:06:38,340 --> 01:06:39,070
Madam-sir!

986
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,670
I need to talk to you.

987
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:42,350
Tell me.

988
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,380
Madam-sir,

989
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,730
my team and I want to work on
the gas pipeline tunnel.

990
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:53,230
Our visas are about to expire...

991
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,190
And the money I have earned
in the last 3 years isn't enough.

992
01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:58,480
My sister gets married next month...

993
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:00,440
Others need to build houses...

994
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:02,140
Pay for medical bills.

995
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:05,850
The gas tunnel pays
3 times what we get now.

996
01:07:06,190 --> 01:07:08,940
That's because it's 3 times
riskier to work there too.

997
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,940
Think it through Bharat.

998
01:07:12,110 --> 01:07:13,940
I have madam-sir. Over and over.

999
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:16,720
We want to do this.

1000
01:07:26,650 --> 01:07:28,310
Come on, hurry up.

1001
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:31,020
Hurry up.

1002
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:39,480
It'll take some time to reach
the bottom...

1003
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:41,100
15 minutes!

1004
01:08:12,310 --> 01:08:13,390
Start here.

1005
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:17,020
Digging tunnel,
from here to here.

1006
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,520
From here to here.

1007
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:20,890
Very dangerous.

1008
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:45,350
Bharat...

1009
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:46,890
Bro I can't breathe.

1010
01:08:46,980 --> 01:08:50,190
We're making 3 times the money.
Be quiet and dig.

1011
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:52,390
Praise the lord!

1012
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:53,480
Keep at it!

1013
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:31,060
Hey...

1014
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:33,140
What was that?

1015
01:09:34,230 --> 01:09:35,560
I think it's an earthquake...

1016
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:40,980
Wait here. I'll go check.

1017
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:55,980
Hey look at this...
That is not good!

1018
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:27,800
It's an earthquake!

1019
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,920
Run for your lives...
or you'll get trapped!

1020
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:31,920
This is Control!

1021
01:10:32,010 --> 01:10:35,550
We're about to hit a gas line,
we need to get our men out, right now.

1022
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,800
The gas pocket has blown up.
Get them out!

1023
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:45,880
C'mon! Go, go, go!

1024
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,970
My boys... my boys are left behind!

1025
01:11:05,470 --> 01:11:07,800
Wait for them...
I beg you, please wait!

1026
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:09,840
- But what about my boys?
- They'll come. Wait.

1027
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,010
Bharat!

1028
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,760
Vilayati!!!

1029
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:17,050
All the way from here to there...

1030
01:11:17,130 --> 01:11:18,880
There is a blast
in the gas tunnel...

1031
01:11:19,470 --> 01:11:21,880
Run Vilayati!
The tunnel is collapsing!

1032
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:23,800
- Bharat!
- Vilayati!

1033
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,840
Towards the lift.

1034
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:30,630
Uncle let's go. Get them.

1035
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:32,646
My boys are stuck down there.

1036
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:35,380
Yes uncle, we'll get them all.
Trust me.

1037
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:37,010
Take him down...

1038
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:38,920
Listen to me!

1039
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:40,590
It's too dangerous down there.

1040
01:11:40,740 --> 01:11:42,920
The lift can't go back down.
The tunnel has collapsed.

1041
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Let's go!

1042
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:55,800
Bharat! My leg... I'm trapped.

1043
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,470
Don't worry Vilayati...

1044
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:00,050
I'm here.

1045
01:12:09,230 --> 01:12:15,090
On the count of 3 Vilayati...
1, 2, 3...

1046
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:19,880
Father.

1047
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:42,340
Madam-sir...

1048
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:43,760
Uncle...

1049
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:45,290
Where's Bharat?

1050
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:46,730
Bharat...

1051
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:48,640
Bharat!

1052
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:51,350
Bharat!

1053
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:53,480
Bharat!

1054
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,640
Bharat!

1055
01:13:00,190 --> 01:13:01,190
Bharat!

1056
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:02,940
Bharat!

1057
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:06,381
Bharat, bro what will I tell your family,
if something happens to you!

1058
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:08,140
Bharat!

1059
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,390
Bharat!!!

1060
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:13,640
Bharat... Bharat!

1061
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:17,020
Bharat!

1062
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,900
Bharat!!!

1063
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,536
There's people stuck down there.
How are you going to get them out?!

1064
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,940
Madam, why don't you understand
what I am saying?

1065
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,530
Pa, I'm looking after everyone

1066
01:13:50,970 --> 01:13:53,060
at the Hind Ration Store.

1067
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:57,770
Ma still looks as beautiful as ever...

1068
01:13:57,940 --> 01:13:59,060
She doesn't say it,

1069
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:03,190
but everyday her eyes betray
how she waits for you.

1070
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:07,730
Junior has graduated
with distinction Pa.

1071
01:14:08,270 --> 01:14:11,810
He's in Delhi University
now... he studies hard...

1072
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:15,980
Mehek has turned
into such a pretty girl...

1073
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:19,480
She looks after
everyone when I'm gone.

1074
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:23,100
She's getting married in 3 weeks...

1075
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:27,230
Gudiya... my little doll.

1076
01:14:27,690 --> 01:14:30,116
Pa, I looked for her everywhere,
but I haven't been able to find her.

1077
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:34,140
I want to apologize to her...

1078
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,890
And to you, Pa.

1079
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:40,730
Everyone says I have your eyes Pa.

1080
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:41,980
Dad!

1081
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:43,440
Whenever I see a mirror,

1082
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,140
I see your face... that last
look of you at the station...

1083
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:52,350
I had heard that
in your last moments...

1084
01:14:52,730 --> 01:14:57,270
Your entire life flashes
before your eyes.

1085
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:02,020
I have kept my promise till now Pa...

1086
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:07,810
But every breath feels
like my last right now.

1087
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:11,810
I'm sorry Pa, please forgive me...

1088
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:14,956
Promise me... you'll
look after everyone?

1089
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,810
Yes dad.

1090
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,100
Hind Ration Store...

1091
01:15:18,190 --> 01:15:19,860
Now say what you really wanted to...

1092
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:20,940
Call your father.

1093
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:22,480
I'll see you there, with Gudiya.

1094
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,916
You're the eldest.
Look after everyone.

1095
01:15:23,940 --> 01:15:27,550
- Yes dad.
- Don't forget, I will come.

1096
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:41,810
Pa...

1097
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:46,520
Bharat!

1098
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:49,230
Vilayati...

1099
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:52,100
My buddy is alive!

1100
01:15:52,190 --> 01:15:53,440
Don't cry.

1101
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,560
We are not going to die here Vilayati.

1102
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:00,100
We'll get out of here.

1103
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,270
Ya.

1104
01:16:02,700 --> 01:16:03,860
Who else is down here?

1105
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,480
Roli... Yadav... and many others...

1106
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,350
I'm scared Bharat.

1107
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:09,520
Don't be...

1108
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:13,100
Remember what Radha used to say?

1109
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:17,060
Will you put your lives on the line?

1110
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,140
Let's

1111
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:22,390
do that one more time.

1112
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:27,230
Alive, you beat inside me...

1113
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:33,590
And in you, I live and die.

1114
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:39,140
Alive, you beat inside me...

1115
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:40,890
It's too late now.

1116
01:16:42,350 --> 01:16:43,730
There's no hope.

1117
01:17:09,350 --> 01:17:10,560
My boys are okay!

1118
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,020
My boys are okay!

1119
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:24,480
They are alive... thank god.

1120
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:38,060
You're okay Vilayati?

1121
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:40,190
Yes uncle... Bharat saved us all.

1122
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:40,730
He did!

1123
01:17:40,810 --> 01:17:45,520
Alive, you beat inside me...

1124
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:51,850
And in you, I live and die.

1125
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:58,270
Like a phoenix I will rise,

1126
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:04,890
to break these chains and fly.

1127
01:18:41,230 --> 01:18:46,640
Bharat! Bharat!

1128
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:48,480
Grandpa is the best!
Grandpa is the best!

1129
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,440
Come on kids... have your snacks.

1130
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,810
The story can wait.

1131
01:18:56,390 --> 01:18:58,270
Are you happy big daddy...

1132
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:00,770
Now that you've narrated your story?

1133
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,270
It's my happy birthday...

1134
01:19:03,350 --> 01:19:06,940
I'd like it if you'd
feed me with your hands...

1135
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:16,220
You are such a self-obsessed man...

1136
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:20,270
What happened?

1137
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:21,850
Nothing...

1138
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:26,350
Just remembered that hug
from 40 years ago.

1139
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:29,730
How you grabbed me...

1140
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,140
Were you taking
advantage of me?!

1141
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:38,890
You think you are too smart, no?!

1142
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:46,690
Happy birthday!

1143
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:49,440
Madam-sir,

1144
01:19:51,850 --> 01:19:53,100
I love you.

1145
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:07,030
Okay grandpa, now tell us the rest...

1146
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:09,910
The kids are not
going to give up bro...

1147
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:12,320
And now even we want
to hear this story.

1148
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,400
Okay.

1149
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:15,940
Come on kids. Settle down.

1150
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:18,660
Tinku, sit straight.

1151
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:21,610
Okay grandpa, everyone's ready...

1152
01:20:21,690 --> 01:20:23,150
What happened next?

1153
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:24,570
Hang on...

1154
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:28,650
If you and madam-sir
met 40 years ago,

1155
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:31,190
then why did you guys
never get married?

1156
01:20:31,690 --> 01:20:35,220
That's... a bit complicated.

1157
01:20:37,030 --> 01:20:40,610
You want to tell them?

1158
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:46,280
Bharat and his team
have done a miracle.

1159
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,980
What I mean to say...

1160
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:52,780
Is the one who stands up
and fights in his hardest time,

1161
01:20:53,230 --> 01:20:54,400
is the real hero...

1162
01:20:54,690 --> 01:20:55,820
Bravo!

1163
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,230
I would like to now request the
company heads to facilitate the team

1164
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,240
with the prize money and mementoes.
Thank you.

1165
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:08,470
And today,

1166
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,530
in front of everyone,

1167
01:21:11,070 --> 01:21:13,030
I want to say something
personal to Bharat...

1168
01:21:13,170 --> 01:21:14,170
What?

1169
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:19,980
I thought we were as
far apart as east and west...

1170
01:21:22,780 --> 01:21:25,070
I couldn't even bear to look at you...

1171
01:21:28,060 --> 01:21:29,400
But now I think...

1172
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,690
I love you Bharat...

1173
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:37,980
Holy mother of god!

1174
01:21:38,190 --> 01:21:39,320
Marry me?

1175
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:46,400
Madam-sir is bold...

1176
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:47,650
Bharat is clean bowled!

1177
01:21:47,780 --> 01:21:49,660
I'm just glad I didn't
get stuck in that tunnel!

1178
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,070
Give me a big hand!

1179
01:21:52,900 --> 01:21:56,440
Are you going to invite me, or should
I just crash your sister's wedding?

1180
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,320
Did you tell your
mom and sister about me?

1181
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:06,320
Madam-sir,
they're a little conservative...

1182
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:08,440
I'll need some more time.

1183
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,070
Look Bharat,

1184
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:16,900
I have always been pretty clear
about what I want...

1185
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:18,610
I don't have parents

1186
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:21,110
who could teach me right and wrong...

1187
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,940
So I just say whatever
comes to my head...

1188
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,610
It's my age to get married...

1189
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:32,110
Yes, madam-sir...

1190
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:33,820
I like you...

1191
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:35,570
Thank you madam-sir...

1192
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:37,900
So I said it in front of everyone...

1193
01:22:38,050 --> 01:22:39,190
That's okay madam-sir...

1194
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:40,640
Now tell me,

1195
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:42,970
when do you want to get married?

1196
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,980
That day,
when I was trapped in that tunnel,

1197
01:22:53,890 --> 01:22:55,670
many faces flashed in my mind...

1198
01:22:57,860 --> 01:22:59,030
Yours,

1199
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,570
my Ma's,

1200
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,190
my siblings,

1201
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:06,360
Vilayati...

1202
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:09,030
I had lost all will.

1203
01:23:09,940 --> 01:23:11,940
The only thing that
kept me alive was the

1204
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:15,950
promise I made to my Pa.

1205
01:23:16,810 --> 01:23:20,110
Madam-sir, I really like you...

1206
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,190
And I love you too.

1207
01:23:24,570 --> 01:23:28,030
But I am scared that my love for you

1208
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,690
will get in the way of my duties.

1209
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:41,480
Please forgive me...
Oh, not at all.

1210
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:44,270
You're not selfish...
you're too noble... like god himself.

1211
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:46,650
You've been stringing
me along for months,

1212
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:50,440
and now you wanna just
say goodbye over a shawarma?!

1213
01:23:52,860 --> 01:23:56,320
You shouldn't have filled
my head with this dream...

1214
01:23:56,400 --> 01:23:57,860
When it can't come true.

1215
01:23:59,530 --> 01:24:01,400
You've broken my heart...

1216
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:04,690
And I can't forgive you.

1217
01:24:06,820 --> 01:24:08,030
But just know this...

1218
01:24:08,670 --> 01:24:10,860
You're only a man...

1219
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,510
Stop trying to act like you're a god.

1220
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:45,030
I'm the smartest advocate
at Allahabad court!

1221
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,690
Our families have been talking
for 3 months...

1222
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:53,180
But these two had to get their cataracts
operated on as soon as we fixed the meeting!

1223
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:54,570
Hence, the goggles.

1224
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,150
But I said...

1225
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,570
If I have to marry the chick...
I mean girl, maybe

1226
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,110
I need to go check her out.

1227
01:25:01,260 --> 01:25:02,450
She's nice.

1228
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:05,940
That's the girl's aunt!

1229
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,940
This is the girl!!!
Put your hand down...

1230
01:25:08,030 --> 01:25:10,710
And don't get so excited. We're
here for my wedding... sit straight.

1231
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:15,480
So Mr. Brother-in-Law,

1232
01:25:15,650 --> 01:25:19,820
I heard you were
digging for oil in the desert?

1233
01:25:20,110 --> 01:25:21,940
You seriously like this idiot?

1234
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:25,150
Yes brother, he sings really well...

1235
01:25:27,250 --> 01:25:29,400
We've heard you sing really well...

1236
01:25:35,820 --> 01:25:43,820
I can hear a voice...
a sweet & melodious voice!

1237
01:25:44,860 --> 01:25:47,150
You sure about a
life with this cartoon?

1238
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,110
Bro! Just say yes...

1239
01:25:53,240 --> 01:25:54,490
We like the boy.

1240
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,060
Thank you.

1241
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:08,440
Breaking news!

1242
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,150
The drummers are here!

1243
01:26:23,250 --> 01:26:25,440
Step on it man! Louder...

1244
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:33,360
Madam-sir...

1245
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:38,680
I'm going to beat you with this stick!

1246
01:26:46,980 --> 01:26:48,820
Mr. Bharat... did you see a ghost?

1247
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:51,480
More like a ghostess!

1248
01:26:52,730 --> 01:26:53,730
Are the sweets ready?

1249
01:26:53,780 --> 01:26:55,400
It'll take some time... I'm on it.

1250
01:26:56,180 --> 01:26:59,230
The sweets are ready... and so am I!

1251
01:27:01,780 --> 01:27:03,750
What's happening to me?!

1252
01:27:04,080 --> 01:27:05,480
When can I get my payment?

1253
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,456
You'll get it...
make sure the mattresses are soft!

1254
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:09,510
It's softer than wool...
here touch it!

1255
01:27:14,110 --> 01:27:16,400
Who you going to sleep with on it?

1256
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,060
Vilayati!

1257
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:34,150
Bharat... the groom is here.
Come on...

1258
01:27:34,230 --> 01:27:36,030
- They've come?
- Yes, outside... at the door.

1259
01:27:36,120 --> 01:27:37,480
Gimme a sec...

1260
01:27:37,750 --> 01:27:39,690
Welcome!

1261
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:42,480
Welcome!

1262
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:44,980
Welcome!

1263
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:54,280
Oh god...

1264
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,700
Now I'm seeing madam-sir
in the wedding party as well...

1265
01:27:57,850 --> 01:28:00,320
Now even I'm seeing her.

1266
01:28:00,640 --> 01:28:01,640
You are?

1267
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,190
Can you check?

1268
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:15,230
It's definitely madam-sir...

1269
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:31,980
I was the one who took them for the
oil digging job...

1270
01:28:32,150 --> 01:28:33,530
Even this Vilayati.

1271
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:35,150
Vilayati?

1272
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:36,870
Yes Ma.

1273
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:39,150
She took us there.

1274
01:28:39,480 --> 01:28:43,860
Working side-by-side, Bharat
and I developed some attraction -

1275
01:28:45,900 --> 01:28:49,480
Your brother looks
like an average guy,

1276
01:28:49,980 --> 01:28:52,240
but on the inside...
he's one of a kind!

1277
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:56,070
And one day, I asked Bharat
to marry me in front of everyone.

1278
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,230
But he refused because

1279
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,650
he has a promise to keep...

1280
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:04,050
Maybe he's right.

1281
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:08,060
But if we can't move forward,

1282
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:13,610
can we at least continue being
where we are, in this relationship?

1283
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:14,690
The girl is right.

1284
01:29:14,770 --> 01:29:16,940
The girl is over here.
Hold your gift and sit straight!

1285
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:19,110
I don't believe that
in today's day and age,

1286
01:29:19,190 --> 01:29:21,440
we have to be married
if we love someone.

1287
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:24,830
Ya Ma, no, wait - madam-sir,
what are you saying?!

1288
01:29:25,110 --> 01:29:27,650
Your brother's a player...
but she's the coach!

1289
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:29,980
A live-in... without marriage!

1290
01:29:30,190 --> 01:29:31,900
Why the hell are we
getting married?!

1291
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,150
Bharat! Do you like her too?

1292
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:39,780
Ma, you have no idea.

1293
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:41,280
Be quiet...

1294
01:29:43,490 --> 01:29:44,490
Bharat?

1295
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:50,510
Yes Ma,

1296
01:29:52,030 --> 01:29:53,410
I like her.

1297
01:29:55,940 --> 01:29:56,980
Okay then...

1298
01:29:57,650 --> 01:29:58,650
Okay?

1299
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,690
You can do what you guys deem right.

1300
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:13,430
My love, is it that hard?

1301
01:30:13,510 --> 01:30:15,730
To buy me a pump for my backyard.

1302
01:30:15,820 --> 01:30:17,940
Listen to me - your village belle,

1303
01:30:18,030 --> 01:30:20,630
I ain't walking to the village well!

1304
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:23,530
I ain't walking to that well!

1305
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:26,780
My love, is it that hard?

1306
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:29,030
To buy me a pump for my backyard.

1307
01:30:29,110 --> 01:30:31,320
Listen to me - your village belle,

1308
01:30:31,400 --> 01:30:33,980
I ain't walking to the village well!

1309
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:36,900
I ain't walking to that well!

1310
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:39,980
I'll jump across your rooftop...

1311
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:42,780
I'll whisk you away, I won't stop,

1312
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:46,280
I've got my eye on you.

1313
01:30:48,030 --> 01:30:50,730
Enough with this decency...

1314
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:53,320
I'm declaring an emergency...

1315
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:56,940
This long-distance, I can't do.

1316
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:00,550
Come a little closer, dear...

1317
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:03,190
I wanna touch your heart.

1318
01:31:03,270 --> 01:31:05,860
This village belle has got no fear,

1319
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:09,150
no one can dare keep us apart.

1320
01:31:11,330 --> 01:31:12,360
Come hither...

1321
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:23,070
Baby, come hither.

1322
01:31:33,360 --> 01:31:36,010
My love, is it that hard?

1323
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:38,320
To buy me a pump for my backyard.

1324
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,520
Listen to me - your village belle,

1325
01:31:40,730 --> 01:31:43,280
I ain't walking to the village well!

1326
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:46,770
My love, is it that hard?

1327
01:31:46,850 --> 01:31:49,030
To buy me a pump for my backyard.

1328
01:31:49,150 --> 01:31:51,230
Listen to me - your village belle,

1329
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,780
I ain't walking to the village well!

1330
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:56,480
I ain't walking to that well!

1331
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:57,840
Come hither...

1332
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:18,570
Yo, why you bringing down the house?

1333
01:32:18,840 --> 01:32:23,730
You're lighting fires I can't douse...

1334
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:29,430
Never seen your swag or this style,

1335
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:33,770
couldn't see you coming from a mile.

1336
01:32:34,040 --> 01:32:36,530
You say you want me close...

1337
01:32:36,700 --> 01:32:39,150
But now is not the time sweetheart.

1338
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:41,930
This village belle has got no fear,

1339
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:45,110
no one can dare keep us apart.

1340
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:48,480
So come hither...

1341
01:32:52,540 --> 01:32:53,900
Just come closer.

1342
01:33:03,310 --> 01:33:04,440
Baby, come hither.

1343
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:12,100
Let me shower you with flowers...

1344
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:14,730
I'll scream it from atop all towers...

1345
01:33:14,810 --> 01:33:18,320
Stop teasing me and just say 'Yes'.

1346
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:21,830
So come a little closer, dear...

1347
01:33:22,010 --> 01:33:24,510
I wanna touch your heart,

1348
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:27,300
this village belle has got no fear,

1349
01:33:27,380 --> 01:33:30,410
no one can dare keep us apart.

1350
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:33,400
So come hither...

1351
01:33:33,480 --> 01:33:36,100
This was a golden
phase of our lives...

1352
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:38,740
I was probably the first Indian son

1353
01:33:38,820 --> 01:33:41,570
to get permission
to live-in with a girl,

1354
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:43,640
from his own mother!

1355
01:33:43,850 --> 01:33:47,310
Inspired by me... junior too
had a love marriage!

1356
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,680
At the same time, the country saw
more jobs...

1357
01:33:50,870 --> 01:33:52,000
And madam-sir...

1358
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,890
- Because of her good looks and attitude,
- In today's news...

1359
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:59,210
- landed a job as a news anchor!
- The government has lifted the national emergency,

1360
01:33:59,380 --> 01:34:01,390
and announced union
elections in March...

1361
01:34:01,470 --> 01:34:03,680
In the day she read the news,

1362
01:34:03,830 --> 01:34:06,390
and at night she helped
us study at the night school...

1363
01:34:06,470 --> 01:34:08,720
So I could clear high school...

1364
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:12,100
And apply for a job in the railways...

1365
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:14,070
And one day...

1366
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:16,210
This Madan Lal is from Delhi...
he'll whack them!

1367
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:17,740
Marshall to Madan Lal.

1368
01:34:19,630 --> 01:34:20,920
And, he's bowled!

1369
01:34:22,090 --> 01:34:23,380
We need Kirmani!

1370
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:26,130
Vilayati!

1371
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:29,500
Vilayati!

1372
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,420
Holding to Kirmani...

1373
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,290
Hang on to this... it's lucky!

1374
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:36,560
And Kirmani goes too!

1375
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:41,150
Bharat... our boys got slammed
in the finals!

1376
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:43,750
183 all out.

1377
01:34:45,320 --> 01:34:46,320
What's this?

1378
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:50,010
I now have a job
in the railways!

1379
01:34:50,350 --> 01:34:52,990
So you'll be a station
master in 2 years!

1380
01:34:53,070 --> 01:34:55,340
Your dream has come true...

1381
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:57,750
Congratulations bro!

1382
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,880
We sell government rations,
but since it's a great location...

1383
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:06,540
You can sell just about anything.

1384
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:08,380
What's this drama outside the shop?

1385
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:09,540
Let's see...

1386
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,460
You can't sell this shop...

1387
01:35:15,970 --> 01:35:16,970
Why not?

1388
01:35:17,210 --> 01:35:18,850
This isn't your shop?

1389
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,040
No...

1390
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,280
But it's my aunt's shop.

1391
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:26,300
And I have been running
it with her for the last 10 years!

1392
01:35:26,640 --> 01:35:29,660
She's barely been dead for
2 months and you want to sell it off?

1393
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,090
Keep your voice down...

1394
01:35:35,890 --> 01:35:38,970
Is this how you
talk to your elders?!

1395
01:35:48,610 --> 01:35:50,340
I don't have any money left...

1396
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:53,970
And I'm not going to be
a burden on anyone else.

1397
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:56,970
You want this shop?

1398
01:35:58,050 --> 01:36:00,760
Then get the money and buy it from me!

1399
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:16,930
Hind Ration Store.

1400
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:18,800
I'll see you there, with Gudiya.

1401
01:36:18,890 --> 01:36:21,450
- You are the eldest. Look after everyone.
- Yes Pa...

1402
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:23,220
- I'll meet you there.
- Pa!

1403
01:36:26,930 --> 01:36:30,140
Hind Ration Store was the only chance

1404
01:36:30,470 --> 01:36:32,130
to see dad again...

1405
01:36:32,290 --> 01:36:37,620
Amarnath to Holding...
loud appeal for LBW... given!!!

1406
01:36:37,890 --> 01:36:40,180
What a twisted stroke of luck.

1407
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:41,970
The whole country

1408
01:36:42,180 --> 01:36:45,840
was celebrating India's first
world cup victory...

1409
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:50,010
Kapil dev grabbed the world cup
on the Lord's balcony,

1410
01:36:50,090 --> 01:36:55,180
and here... the shop was on sale,
and to save it

1411
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:58,090
my childhood dream of
becoming a station master

1412
01:36:58,180 --> 01:36:59,590
just like my father...

1413
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,750
Was slipping from my hands...

1414
01:37:02,830 --> 01:37:05,550
Mr. Chaurasia,
can you get us some work where

1415
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:08,180
we can earn a lot of money, very fast.

1416
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:10,490
You want work on a ship?
In the merchant navy?

1417
01:37:10,570 --> 01:37:14,210
Oh no, no, we can't fight!
Give us something simpler...

1418
01:37:14,290 --> 01:37:16,000
I'm not talking about warships,

1419
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,790
I'm talking about cargo ships!

1420
01:37:17,870 --> 01:37:21,460
The ones that are used
to send goods to other countries?

1421
01:37:21,750 --> 01:37:23,750
The money is great...

1422
01:37:23,830 --> 01:37:27,080
You already have experience
in drilling right?

1423
01:37:27,310 --> 01:37:31,500
I'll place you in the engine room...
as mechanics.

1424
01:37:31,660 --> 01:37:32,660
What say?

1425
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:33,760
Done.

1426
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:35,080
But guys,

1427
01:37:35,250 --> 01:37:37,660
this can get dangerous sometimes...

1428
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:39,050
Dangerous, how?

1429
01:37:39,130 --> 01:37:41,760
I mean, sometimes in these waters...

1430
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:43,090
I'll do it!

1431
01:37:45,890 --> 01:37:49,510
So now you want to marry me?

1432
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:52,760
So I can look after your mother,
when you are gone?

1433
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:55,510
Junior is always out for work,

1434
01:37:56,020 --> 01:37:58,220
Mehek is married and has her kid.

1435
01:37:58,510 --> 01:38:00,840
Ma can't run
the store at her age...

1436
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:03,800
Store!

1437
01:38:05,340 --> 01:38:10,410
You're bribing me with marriage
so that I will run your store?!

1438
01:38:11,090 --> 01:38:14,510
You want me to
quit my job and run this shop?

1439
01:38:15,170 --> 01:38:20,090
Bharat, I'm here with you,
because I want to be with you...

1440
01:38:20,750 --> 01:38:22,970
I don't need favors from you.

1441
01:38:23,260 --> 01:38:24,930
Ma'am we are going live in 30 seconds.

1442
01:38:28,220 --> 01:38:30,430
No Bharat...
you are not going anywhere...

1443
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:32,680
We don't need to buy that damn store.

1444
01:38:32,890 --> 01:38:34,220
No need to butter me up.

1445
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:38,020
Even that big ship 'TONSIL'
had drowned in the sea...

1446
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:40,800
Ma that was Titonic... not Tonsil.

1447
01:38:40,930 --> 01:38:42,460
Whatever... it did sink no?

1448
01:38:42,620 --> 01:38:45,370
I won't let you do something
dangerous again.

1449
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:48,410
Ma, Vilayati and I
just need to do 3-4 trips

1450
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:50,160
and we will have all the money...

1451
01:38:50,640 --> 01:38:53,370
What? Vilayati's also going?

1452
01:38:55,490 --> 01:38:56,870
Oh ya, Ma I'm also going.

1453
01:38:57,040 --> 01:39:00,700
Trust me,
there are no dangers in this work.

1454
01:39:01,670 --> 01:39:02,890
I swear on your big toe!

1455
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,450
Vilayati! Hold on tight...

1456
01:39:12,610 --> 01:39:15,240
How long should I hold it?!

1457
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:18,020
As long as this storm lasts!

1458
01:39:27,680 --> 01:39:29,220
Vilayati!

1459
01:39:40,030 --> 01:39:44,740
The only thing more hazardous
than these storms was

1460
01:39:45,610 --> 01:39:48,370
our ship captain - Sundar Singh!

1461
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:51,650
All you...
ship come... know? Together...

1462
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,360
Got it?

1463
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:03,810
Got it?

1464
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:09,730
What ancient dialect is
this Neanderthal yapping in?

1465
01:40:10,240 --> 01:40:12,490
I don't get a word he is saying...

1466
01:40:13,670 --> 01:40:14,950
- Dude!
- Ya?

1467
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:18,580
- What did he say?
- You don't... last life!

1468
01:40:19,030 --> 01:40:22,860
The sky is blue... I got no clue!

1469
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:31,050
The Captain had cluttering where the
mind doesn't work as fast as the mouth.

1470
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:36,510
The speaker presumes he's being clear
but those around him always look lost.

1471
01:40:37,650 --> 01:40:38,650
Whose purse?!

1472
01:40:39,180 --> 01:40:40,200
Whose purse, sir?!

1473
01:40:41,240 --> 01:40:42,240
Disperse!

1474
01:40:42,650 --> 01:40:43,970
I said disperse!

1475
01:40:46,330 --> 01:40:48,570
Don't you get it?
So clearly I said...

1476
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:53,740
Captains could bring their families
along on the voyage...

1477
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:59,400
And the best thing about this ship
was the captain's 5 year old - Minnie.

1478
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:03,190
Who I had become fast friends with.

1479
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:09,490
For a moment I thought it was Gudiya

1480
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:12,510
standing in front of
me disguised as Minnie...

1481
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:15,570
Gudiya! Don't let go of my hand...

1482
01:41:26,730 --> 01:41:30,360
The ship's engine room
would practically boil us alive...

1483
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:43,360
All our free time was
spent playing with Minnie...

1484
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:49,620
But with Minnie I would
feel like Gudiya is with me again...

1485
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:52,960
Gudiya, you have
a mole behind your ear...

1486
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:54,210
What's a mole?

1487
01:41:54,290 --> 01:41:56,910
It's god's way of
making sure pretty girls

1488
01:41:57,080 --> 01:42:01,120
are always protected from any evil...

1489
01:42:04,790 --> 01:42:05,790
He's here, he's here...

1490
01:42:06,040 --> 01:42:06,460
Hello sir.

1491
01:42:06,540 --> 01:42:10,620
But at sea,
the biggest threat was our captain...

1492
01:42:10,910 --> 01:42:13,310
And one day, Vilayati accidentally
struck gold...

1493
01:42:20,460 --> 01:42:23,540
Vilayati looked like
he was having a stroke...

1494
01:42:23,620 --> 01:42:25,460
And going into a coma.

1495
01:42:32,440 --> 01:42:36,280
Mr. Captain sir had started invading
Vilayati's dreams...

1496
01:42:36,490 --> 01:42:39,070
I can't follow a thing...

1497
01:42:39,730 --> 01:42:40,730
Vilayati!

1498
01:42:41,440 --> 01:42:43,820
I've cracked the ancient dialect!

1499
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:49,440
Shape... machine... body... machine.

1500
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,730
Sir, you're our senior.

1501
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:53,480
You know it best.

1502
01:42:57,070 --> 01:42:58,150
Whoa!

1503
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:02,390
Got it, got it, got it!

1504
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:11,350
We had found an antidote to
Mr. Captain's dialect...

1505
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:14,350
And now everyone on the ship

1506
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:16,330
was feeding it back to the captain!

1507
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:18,310
Sir, you're our senior.
You know it best.

1508
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:19,390
My boy!

1509
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:23,350
Sir, you're our senior.
You know it best.

1510
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:25,960
Sir, you're our senior.
You know it best.

1511
01:43:35,320 --> 01:43:37,110
How many times will
you count it Bharat?

1512
01:43:37,240 --> 01:43:39,160
- They've paid us in full.
- Ya, ya...

1513
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:41,860
Keep it safe,
what if someone picks your pocket?

1514
01:43:42,650 --> 01:43:43,940
I was just counting

1515
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,860
how many more trips
we need to make to buy the shop back.

1516
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:50,690
You can keep my money as well.
Now can we go see the world a little?

1517
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:53,740
Isn't our life like a dream?

1518
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:56,030
The partition,

1519
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,740
that circus... Ya.

1520
01:43:58,820 --> 01:44:00,260
Oil wells...

1521
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:02,080
And now this.

1522
01:44:02,490 --> 01:44:04,110
You're absolutely correct.

1523
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:05,780
It's a dream

1524
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:11,150
and I'm leaving before you wake me up!

1525
01:44:11,380 --> 01:44:12,380
Oh boy...

1526
01:44:12,530 --> 01:44:13,860
Hey, Vilayati!

1527
01:44:13,940 --> 01:44:16,820
Bharat... this is the life!

1528
01:44:16,940 --> 01:44:19,360
- Vilayati!
- Girl, Vilayati...

1529
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:21,270
The idiot is going
to lose all his money...

1530
01:44:21,310 --> 01:44:22,310
Hello!

1531
01:44:25,610 --> 01:44:31,820
When can I meet your parents?!
Need to marry.

1532
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,110
- Vilayati!
- Come baby...

1533
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,360
Bharat!

1534
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:38,040
Vilayati,
I think you're rushing into it!

1535
01:44:38,070 --> 01:44:39,680
Meet your sister-in-law!

1536
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:41,070
Get a hold on yourself man...

1537
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:42,030
What's your name?

1538
01:44:42,110 --> 01:44:43,150
Sussan...

1539
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,940
Sasi?! That's an Indian name - Sasi!

1540
01:44:46,030 --> 01:44:47,030
No!

1541
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,320
It's Sussan! Sus-san...

1542
01:44:50,940 --> 01:44:52,690
You sound just like my mommy!

1543
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:55,150
Where you taking me?

1544
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:57,440
I take to you to the paradise...

1545
01:44:57,700 --> 01:44:59,280
I'm not coming back...

1546
01:44:59,360 --> 01:45:03,320
I'm growing old with her.
Cancel my ticket Bharat!

1547
01:45:04,150 --> 01:45:07,760
I can see all your friends are having
lots of fun over there..

1548
01:45:08,110 --> 01:45:10,800
Nobody wait at home for them...

1549
01:45:11,050 --> 01:45:14,090
Me, country waiting...

1550
01:45:14,620 --> 01:45:15,660
Very special...

1551
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:17,960
- Look everyone how they dance!
- This is noise!

1552
01:45:18,040 --> 01:45:19,040
It's not noise!

1553
01:45:19,120 --> 01:45:20,610
So what's your name?

1554
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:21,790
Bharat...

1555
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:23,600
And where are you from, Bharat?

1556
01:45:23,930 --> 01:45:26,300
- India...
- Bharat, hold! I'm coming back...

1557
01:45:26,690 --> 01:45:28,780
She wants to control my life already!

1558
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:31,270
Divorce before marriage. FINAL!

1559
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,980
Aye, where you are going?

1560
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:34,550
You're supposed to marry me...

1561
01:45:34,710 --> 01:45:38,030
Marry, okay... music, dance... no...

1562
01:45:38,110 --> 01:45:39,610
What is wrong with our music?

1563
01:45:39,690 --> 01:45:41,360
Your music is noise!

1564
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:42,650
Eardrum burst...

1565
01:45:42,700 --> 01:45:44,690
Our ship engine has more melody...

1566
01:45:44,770 --> 01:45:47,810
Okay, play your music...
I want to see...

1567
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:50,900
Bharat... you have to sing!

1568
01:45:51,190 --> 01:45:53,560
No one will understand
a regional song here...

1569
01:45:53,880 --> 01:45:54,690
They'll laugh at us.

1570
01:45:54,770 --> 01:45:56,670
Our music comes
straight from the heart...

1571
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,560
- That's true...
- It's the song of our land.

1572
01:45:58,940 --> 01:46:00,150
They'll get it...

1573
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:04,190
Everybody, Bharat will sing!

1574
01:46:14,690 --> 01:46:19,230
For a fistful of pennies,
my home I've left behind...

1575
01:46:24,810 --> 01:46:29,650
I've come so far away,
but home is always on my mind...

1576
01:46:33,980 --> 01:46:36,060
A picture of home is all I carry...

1577
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:42,150
Cut my chest open,
if you got a doubt...

1578
01:46:42,360 --> 01:46:46,690
Home is all you will see,
when you tear my heart out.

1579
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:49,480
Away from home... too far away...

1580
01:46:49,560 --> 01:46:51,980
I've wandered far away from home.

1581
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:54,560
Away from home... too far away...

1582
01:46:54,650 --> 01:46:56,980
I got to go back... far as I may roam.

1583
01:46:57,060 --> 01:47:02,020
I've found it all...
but not the peace of home...

1584
01:47:02,100 --> 01:47:07,400
I got to go back... far as I may roam.

1585
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:29,710
Ma!

1586
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:35,780
My child... how have you been?
No phone, no letters...

1587
01:47:51,620 --> 01:47:53,280
I've found myself a wife Ma.

1588
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:18,140
The sense of abandon
at home is way better...

1589
01:48:18,750 --> 01:48:23,490
A hug from a loved one,
is no match for a letter...

1590
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:28,660
To while away here, I find no time...

1591
01:48:28,810 --> 01:48:33,070
I'll take a warm embrace,
over earning a dime...

1592
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:38,530
To earn myself a few pennies
I've walked away from home...

1593
01:48:38,750 --> 01:48:43,410
To buy myself a joy or two...
far and wide I roam...

1594
01:48:43,990 --> 01:48:48,800
The world & all its
joys I don't wish to see...

1595
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:53,450
Every little memory of her's
makes me go weak in the knee...

1596
01:48:53,530 --> 01:48:55,950
Away from home... too far away...

1597
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:58,530
I've wandered far away from home.

1598
01:48:58,620 --> 01:49:01,070
Away from home... too far away...

1599
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:03,280
I got to go back... far as I may roam.

1600
01:49:03,370 --> 01:49:06,120
Away from home... too far away...

1601
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:08,620
I've wandered far away from home.

1602
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:11,200
Away from home... too far away...

1603
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:13,620
I got to go back... far as I may roam.

1604
01:49:13,700 --> 01:49:18,410
I've found it all...
but not the peace of home...

1605
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:25,450
I got to go back... far as I may roam.

1606
01:49:30,170 --> 01:49:31,240
Sir, you should see this.

1607
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:33,230
Sir, a fishing boat
doesn't travel this fast.

1608
01:49:33,310 --> 01:49:34,310
What?

1609
01:49:41,980 --> 01:49:43,650
Sir, I think it's pirates.

1610
01:49:43,910 --> 01:49:46,010
- Sea pirates, sir.
- What? Show!

1611
01:49:46,610 --> 01:49:50,430
Yes, yes... African sea pirates!

1612
01:49:50,510 --> 01:49:52,880
Raise the alarm guys...
we have a pirate boat approaching.

1613
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:56,580
Come on, come on, hurry up, fire it...

1614
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:03,066
What are you saying sir?
I don't get it...

1615
01:50:03,090 --> 01:50:04,550
- Water hose man!
- Fire hose...

1616
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,840
Okay boys,
get the fire hose ready fast...

1617
01:50:08,500 --> 01:50:10,840
Okay guys, to the main deck...
to the main deck!

1618
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:19,890
Hit him!

1619
01:50:21,600 --> 01:50:23,010
Don't let them get away!

1620
01:50:28,510 --> 01:50:32,010
Hey Bharat... you also fire!

1621
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:33,960
There's some danger
in this line of work...

1622
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:36,016
You know these African sea pirates,
they could attack the ship...

1623
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:38,360
And sometimes it can lead to a
teeny-tiny... murder or two.

1624
01:50:38,390 --> 01:50:40,430
Fire the hose from downstairs...

1625
01:50:46,200 --> 01:50:47,880
Run, run, run!

1626
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:50,720
Come on, come on!

1627
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,090
Go side!

1628
01:51:00,340 --> 01:51:01,340
Fire!

1629
01:51:07,070 --> 01:51:08,140
Shoot the hook!

1630
01:51:14,150 --> 01:51:15,590
Climb up!

1631
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:32,640
Don't worry,
nothing will happen to you!

1632
01:51:32,720 --> 01:51:34,350
Get back...

1633
01:51:34,700 --> 01:51:35,700
Get back...

1634
01:51:36,470 --> 01:51:38,406
Bharat! The pirates have captured the
captain and his family...

1635
01:51:38,430 --> 01:51:40,390
Go inside and hide. Go, go, go!

1636
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:44,180
Vilayati!

1637
01:51:44,990 --> 01:51:46,680
Vilayati! Open the door...

1638
01:51:47,570 --> 01:51:48,300
What's the matter?

1639
01:51:48,390 --> 01:51:51,160
Pirates are aboard the ship...
they have the captain and his family.

1640
01:51:51,240 --> 01:51:52,390
What are you saying bro?

1641
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:54,820
Come on, let's help them.

1642
01:51:54,950 --> 01:51:56,720
Shut up and get inside.
If they get us,

1643
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,860
they'll take us along with the captain
for ransom.

1644
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:00,330
And I've just got married bro...

1645
01:52:01,960 --> 01:52:04,070
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1646
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:05,760
Get down, Get down!

1647
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:07,800
Even little Minnie is with them man...

1648
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:10,300
I know you see Gudiya in Minnie...

1649
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,230
Then you know how I've lived

1650
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:15,340
so many years without her.

1651
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:20,720
Open! Open the door!!!

1652
01:52:22,300 --> 01:52:23,540
- Stay down!
- Don't shoot.

1653
01:52:24,510 --> 01:52:28,260
If something happens
to me, give Ma all my money.

1654
01:52:28,340 --> 01:52:32,180
Bharat, this is our last trip...

1655
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:34,380
Don't mess it up!

1656
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:37,050
Don't come if you don't want to...

1657
01:52:37,210 --> 01:52:39,010
Bharat! Listen to me.

1658
01:52:41,720 --> 01:52:44,300
Shut up! I don't understand
what you're saying...

1659
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:46,050
What are you speaking?

1660
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
- What are you doing here?
- The same thing as you.

1661
01:52:58,150 --> 01:52:59,710
When have I ever left you alone?

1662
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,060
What do we do?

1663
01:53:01,830 --> 01:53:04,190
We can't hurt flies if we wanted to...

1664
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,040
I don't know if it will work...

1665
01:53:07,030 --> 01:53:08,400
but I have a plan...

1666
01:53:08,910 --> 01:53:11,190
Hey, I will shoot you both!

1667
01:53:11,270 --> 01:53:12,270
Mikhael!

1668
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:16,480
- Where did you find them?
- They were hiding...

1669
01:53:17,110 --> 01:53:19,900
Save us... Bharat!

1670
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:23,850
Brother, no fight brother...
no shoot brother...

1671
01:53:23,890 --> 01:53:25,520
We all very poor brother...

1672
01:53:25,530 --> 01:53:27,950
Family at home, waiting for us...

1673
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:31,530
Brother, India-Africa same brother...

1674
01:53:31,710 --> 01:53:33,400
Very poor... same colour brother...

1675
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:36,420
Me black, you also black...
You black?

1676
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,640
Sorry brother, brown...
but he black brother...

1677
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,650
- He African?
- No no... I Indian...

1678
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:44,150
- He... Indian?
- Yes, Indian...

1679
01:53:44,700 --> 01:53:47,820
In India,
no white, no black, no brown...

1680
01:53:48,140 --> 01:53:49,200
Everyone same brother...

1681
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:51,610
We Indian, love Africa brother...

1682
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:54,700
We love your...
Michael Jackson brother...

1683
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,150
- Michael Jackson?
- Michael Jackson brother...

1684
01:53:58,630 --> 01:54:00,020
Michael Jackson is American!

1685
01:54:00,150 --> 01:54:01,520
- Oh ya...
- It's wrong!

1686
01:54:03,180 --> 01:54:04,580
We love Pele brother...

1687
01:54:05,560 --> 01:54:07,600
- Pele is from Brazil!
- Brazil?

1688
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:09,760
Sir...

1689
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:11,840
Mandola, Wilson...
Nelson Mandela...

1690
01:54:12,220 --> 01:54:15,630
Brother, we love Mr. Nelson Mandela...

1691
01:54:16,670 --> 01:54:20,960
Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Nelson Mandela
were friends, more like brothers...

1692
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:23,060
- Mandela?
- Yeah! Gandhi...

1693
01:54:23,260 --> 01:54:24,260
- Gandhi?
- Yeah!

1694
01:54:24,500 --> 01:54:25,500
Yes!

1695
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:26,960
Good man...

1696
01:54:27,120 --> 01:54:29,550
Very good man brother...
very good man...

1697
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:32,550
Money?

1698
01:54:32,850 --> 01:54:34,920
Vilayati, he's calming down...

1699
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:37,180
Give him the money...

1700
01:54:37,870 --> 01:54:38,936
No! I won't give him our money...

1701
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:40,540
- Give me money!
- Give him the money...

1702
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,170
We had such dreams man...

1703
01:54:42,590 --> 01:54:45,810
A small house,
a car, bank balance!

1704
01:54:45,890 --> 01:54:47,419
And besides, how will
you buy the shop back?!

1705
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:49,740
Don't get emotional...
just give him the money.

1706
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:53,010
- Give me money...
- Yes brother, giving you money...

1707
01:54:57,300 --> 01:55:01,560
Bank balance,
house, car - like movie -

1708
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:04,100
Deewaar...

1709
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:05,930
Deewaar?

1710
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:08,710
Yes, Amitabh Bachchan movie!

1711
01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:10,770
Yes! Bollywood movie!

1712
01:55:10,850 --> 01:55:14,350
- Amitabh Bachchan - superstar!
- Yes brother...

1713
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:16,850
In Africa everyone
love Amitabh Bachchan!

1714
01:55:16,930 --> 01:55:18,430
I like Amitabh Bachchan...

1715
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,540
I love, Amitabh Bachchan...

1716
01:55:20,620 --> 01:55:23,640
We all like Amitabh Bachchan...
whole India brother,

1717
01:55:23,880 --> 01:55:25,640
love Amitabh Bachchan...

1718
01:55:25,730 --> 01:55:27,640
Amitabh Bachchan...

1719
01:55:28,140 --> 01:55:29,680
Sing Amitabh Bachchan song!

1720
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:32,070
No brother, very difficult brother...

1721
01:55:32,150 --> 01:55:33,150
I said sing!

1722
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:41,270
Meera has the nicest dancing shoes...

1723
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:46,630
But I dance without
my dancing shoes...

1724
01:55:47,020 --> 01:55:47,570
Change!

1725
01:55:47,860 --> 01:55:53,380
It's raining colours...
I'm drenched in red, yellow and green...

1726
01:55:53,530 --> 01:55:59,260
It's raining colours...
I'm drenched in red, yellow and green...

1727
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:06,760
I'm just a poor boy...

1728
01:56:08,610 --> 01:56:10,950
With no men or means...
but god only save you...

1729
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:13,650
That day Mikhael danced with us,

1730
01:56:13,880 --> 01:56:15,880
as if we were childhood friends.

1731
01:56:17,250 --> 01:56:19,640
He gave us back our money,

1732
01:56:19,820 --> 01:56:22,470
and we gave him
half the ship's rations...

1733
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:25,630
But the biggest lesson we learnt was

1734
01:56:25,780 --> 01:56:29,200
that the solution to most
dangerous problems in the world is...

1735
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:33,350
Love, of course...
and Bollywood film songs!

1736
01:56:37,610 --> 01:56:39,710
I bought Hind Ration Store,

1737
01:56:40,170 --> 01:56:42,810
and the whole
family was together once again.

1738
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,290
Ma was happy;

1739
01:56:48,670 --> 01:56:50,290
Madam-sir was happy

1740
01:56:50,660 --> 01:56:51,710
that I was happy!

1741
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:55,710
But Vilayati was over the moon...

1742
01:56:56,040 --> 01:56:58,830
Because he was the
proud first boy of our

1743
01:56:59,370 --> 01:57:01,290
neighborhood who had
married a white girl!

1744
01:57:05,500 --> 01:57:10,460
The 90s gave India 2 new superstars...

1745
01:57:10,790 --> 01:57:13,750
Shahrukh Khan and Sachin Tendulkar.

1746
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:20,750
But our real hero was
Dr. Manmohan Singh - our finance minister,

1747
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:25,710
who liberalized and
globalized the economy.

1748
01:57:31,420 --> 01:57:34,410
We made progress in every field...

1749
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:37,180
Many new
TV channels came to life...

1750
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:39,890
One of them was Zee TV.

1751
01:57:40,430 --> 01:57:46,380
Because of her experience with news,
madam-sir landed a job there.

1752
01:57:46,720 --> 01:57:50,630
The partition of 1947, saw a huge
refugee displacement...

1753
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:53,720
About 15 million people
crossed the border.

1754
01:57:54,070 --> 01:58:00,260
In most cases this was an unplanned
movement to save their own lives.

1755
01:58:00,470 --> 01:58:05,720
In the ensuing chaos, a
lot of families got separated...

1756
01:58:06,220 --> 01:58:08,720
And this sir,
forms the basis of 'me and my own'.

1757
01:58:09,740 --> 01:58:11,800
Sir, we plan to set
up temporary studios like

1758
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:14,430
these on both sides
of the Wagah border...

1759
01:58:14,510 --> 01:58:17,760
Where people will narrate
their stories of getting separated.

1760
01:58:17,950 --> 01:58:20,720
We will broadcast this on
both sides of the border...

1761
01:58:20,970 --> 01:58:26,970
In the hope that maybe some people will
recognize their families. Their loved ones.

1762
01:58:27,220 --> 01:58:33,590
Kumud, your team has been making the
same presentation for the last 4 years...

1763
01:58:34,590 --> 01:58:35,260
Why?

1764
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:39,800
Sir, a lot of people lost
their families during partition.

1765
01:58:40,510 --> 01:58:44,640
This show has the power to
unite them and to change many lives.

1766
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,010
I think this show can be
a game changer for our channel...

1767
01:58:50,970 --> 01:58:54,720
Do you have a personal connection
involved with this show?

1768
01:58:57,680 --> 01:59:00,050
Something like that sir.

1769
01:59:03,040 --> 01:59:06,140
Okay! You are this channel's
creative director,

1770
01:59:06,220 --> 01:59:07,640
that goes without saying...

1771
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:12,140
My only concerns are
the permissions at the border.

1772
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:14,010
Sort them out and

1773
01:59:15,010 --> 01:59:16,140
we are good to go!

1774
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:17,760
Thank you, sir.

1775
01:59:26,270 --> 01:59:29,840
Friends, today is a
historic day... you can see

1776
01:59:30,020 --> 01:59:32,890
the thousands who have
gathered at the Wagah border...

1777
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:34,890
In the slightest hope that

1778
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:38,140
they could look for the
families they lost in 1947

1779
01:59:38,260 --> 01:59:40,260
if they can just meet them once.

1780
01:59:40,720 --> 01:59:43,220
With the help from
governments of both nations,

1781
01:59:43,300 --> 01:59:45,470
Zee TV will make a small effort

1782
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:49,220
over the next 3 months to bring
you stories of families separating...

1783
01:59:49,930 --> 01:59:51,690
And hopefully...
of these families reuniting.

1784
02:00:04,920 --> 02:00:05,970
Bharat!

1785
02:00:06,760 --> 02:00:08,220
Madam-sir is over there.

1786
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:22,840
My will is steady,

1787
02:00:23,800 --> 02:00:27,260
my hope still strong,

1788
02:00:28,340 --> 02:00:32,550
anxious & dry, every tear in my eye...

1789
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:38,640
This wait for you has been too long...

1790
02:00:41,470 --> 02:00:46,470
Will I find the one I seek?

1791
02:00:46,670 --> 02:00:48,030
Friends, I'm right now standing on

1792
02:00:48,090 --> 02:00:51,050
the no-man's land between
India and Pakistan.

1793
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:52,340
It's a special day...

1794
02:00:52,430 --> 02:00:55,760
Because for the first time,
both government's have allowed

1795
02:00:55,930 --> 02:00:57,930
its people on to this no-man's land...

1796
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:01,220
This is Salim Zaidi reporting
to you from the Pakistani side...

1797
02:01:01,300 --> 02:01:02,430
Of the Wagah border.

1798
02:01:02,590 --> 02:01:06,510
All the gathered here hope that
the people across the border...

1799
02:01:06,640 --> 02:01:07,930
Might have some of their own.

1800
02:01:08,010 --> 02:01:12,010
We hope through 'me and my own'
some families are reunited.

1801
02:01:12,680 --> 02:01:17,090
My door always lies ajar,
my eyes search wide & far...

1802
02:01:17,180 --> 02:01:21,430
Where are you? Where are you?

1803
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:26,260
My door always lies ajar,
my eyes search wide & far...

1804
02:01:26,340 --> 02:01:30,340
Where are you? Where are you?

1805
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:34,550
Friends, we welcome you to the 'me and
my own' studio at the Wagah border...

1806
02:01:34,970 --> 02:01:37,970
A similar studio operates
across the border in Pakistan.

1807
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:43,470
In the next 3 months we will listen to tales
of separation caused by the partition.

1808
02:01:43,550 --> 02:01:47,010
Going live in 3... 2... 1...

1809
02:01:47,140 --> 02:01:51,220
Mr. Sawinder Singh...
our viewers want to hear your story.

1810
02:01:51,340 --> 02:01:58,180
We were attacked by rioters
near Lahore on our way to India...

1811
02:01:59,760 --> 02:02:02,010
And we ran and hid in the farms.

1812
02:02:02,660 --> 02:02:04,050
But in the morning...

1813
02:02:05,050 --> 02:02:09,680
I couldn't find
my oldest son - Harpal Singh.

1814
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:18,260
I looked for him everywhere,
but I couldn't find him.

1815
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:24,800
I kept screaming his name
"Harpal!" "Billu!" - "my son!"

1816
02:02:25,220 --> 02:02:28,590
But I couldn't find him.
Just couldn't...

1817
02:02:30,590 --> 02:02:32,590
I am Ravinder Kumar, from Delhi...

1818
02:02:33,140 --> 02:02:34,840
We used to live in Peshawar.

1819
02:02:35,300 --> 02:02:41,010
When the riots broke out, my
younger sister Kishori was in school.

1820
02:02:41,260 --> 02:02:45,890
Some kind souls of our neighborhood
smuggled us out of there,

1821
02:02:46,180 --> 02:02:51,890
but in the chaos, Kishori got lost.

1822
02:02:52,420 --> 02:02:55,090
We looked for her everywhere,

1823
02:02:56,890 --> 02:02:58,340
but I couldn't find her.

1824
02:02:58,640 --> 02:03:00,510
Where are you Kishori?!

1825
02:03:00,730 --> 02:03:04,930
The next person on 'me and
my own' is Bharat from Delhi...

1826
02:03:05,220 --> 02:03:07,010
I was 8 years old...

1827
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,550
14th August 1947...

1828
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:12,220
We were at Mirpur train station...

1829
02:03:12,300 --> 02:03:16,720
I was carrying my sister Gudiya
on my back while

1830
02:03:17,550 --> 02:03:18,906
trying to climb to
the roof of the train...

1831
02:03:18,930 --> 02:03:20,050
Suddenly...

1832
02:03:21,510 --> 02:03:23,470
Suddenly... there was a commotion and.

1833
02:03:26,400 --> 02:03:28,300
Gudiya's hand
slipped out of my hand...

1834
02:03:46,050 --> 02:03:47,680
Gudiya fell down on the platform...

1835
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:50,840
And my Pa

1836
02:03:53,180 --> 02:03:54,510
got down

1837
02:03:59,100 --> 02:04:00,550
to look for her,

1838
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,010
but the train took off...

1839
02:04:04,950 --> 02:04:07,180
Since that day... Ma and I

1840
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:11,720
are waiting for them to come back...

1841
02:04:12,050 --> 02:04:15,680
Lonely, I drift aimless;

1842
02:04:16,030 --> 02:04:19,140
Come back, ease my pain.

1843
02:04:21,220 --> 02:04:25,180
Show me how do I bear this

1844
02:04:25,260 --> 02:04:28,140
unbearable world again.

1845
02:04:29,840 --> 02:04:34,140
I pray for some news of you... of joy

1846
02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:38,890
but prayer too is a failing ploy...

1847
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:42,050
I keep looking back,

1848
02:04:42,180 --> 02:04:44,220
to see what I've become...

1849
02:04:44,470 --> 02:04:50,340
I find myself, lost...
where have I come?

1850
02:04:52,840 --> 02:04:57,390
Will you ever know?
Will you ever come?

1851
02:04:57,470 --> 02:05:00,010
Dear friends, it's a special
moment on 'me and my own'...

1852
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:03,720
We could see a family reuniting
with each other because of this show...

1853
02:05:03,930 --> 02:05:06,970
Some stories from across the border
have come in touch with our tales...

1854
02:05:07,050 --> 02:05:10,220
Today, on our show we will bring

1855
02:05:10,390 --> 02:05:13,590
these stories face
to face with each other.

1856
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:16,050
Sir, please look in that camera...

1857
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:19,970
Is your name Harpal Singh?

1858
02:05:21,140 --> 02:05:25,930
Sir, I don't remember my real name...

1859
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:27,680
I just remember.

1860
02:05:28,090 --> 02:05:35,680
When I was running through the fields
someone was calling me 'Billu!'

1861
02:05:37,720 --> 02:05:42,300
Billu? Are you still
fond of mango pickle?

1862
02:05:43,800 --> 02:05:45,180
Yes...

1863
02:05:46,640 --> 02:05:48,010
I love it.

1864
02:05:51,470 --> 02:05:55,400
Am I your son?

1865
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:59,680
I'm sorry my son...

1866
02:05:59,930 --> 02:06:02,970
I couldn't find you that day!

1867
02:06:17,140 --> 02:06:18,720
Are you my Kishori?

1868
02:06:19,090 --> 02:06:22,050
Yes brother... I'm your Kishori.

1869
02:06:22,760 --> 02:06:27,010
You remember what I called
you when I pulled your cheeks?

1870
02:06:28,010 --> 02:06:29,010
Kishmish.

1871
02:06:29,140 --> 02:06:33,760
My heart is always full;
Tears aplenty, laughs handful,

1872
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:37,680
where are you? Where are you?

1873
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:42,890
My heart is always full;
Tears aplenty, laughs handful,

1874
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:46,890
where are you? Where are you?

1875
02:06:56,970 --> 02:06:59,760
Why did you never go
to Pakistan to look for Pa?

1876
02:07:00,220 --> 02:07:01,550
I was scared...

1877
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:04,550
What if I didn't find him?

1878
02:07:06,220 --> 02:07:08,390
At least the hope of my promise

1879
02:07:10,140 --> 02:07:12,430
has given Ma and me
the strength to go on.

1880
02:07:15,970 --> 02:07:18,590
It took a lot of courage
to even come here...

1881
02:07:21,470 --> 02:07:22,840
Madam-sir...

1882
02:07:26,310 --> 02:07:27,310
Bharat!

1883
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:28,940
Bro,

1884
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:32,020
someone from Pakistan is saying
his son's name is Bharat...

1885
02:07:32,540 --> 02:07:34,400
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1886
02:07:34,610 --> 02:07:37,360
Bharat! This could be your father!

1887
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:40,730
We are going live...

1888
02:07:42,400 --> 02:07:45,520
One second. Sit here.

1889
02:07:45,770 --> 02:07:47,020
- Saurabh!
- Ya!

1890
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:50,150
Viewers, another small hope has
been rekindled on our show today...

1891
02:07:50,360 --> 02:07:54,560
Someone from Pakistan has contacted
us, who believes Bharat is his son.

1892
02:07:54,650 --> 02:07:57,730
Ma! Junior! Come here fast!

1893
02:07:57,880 --> 02:07:59,490
Sir, please look in that camera...

1894
02:08:13,670 --> 02:08:16,020
Did you live in Mirpur?

1895
02:08:16,470 --> 02:08:17,470
Ya!

1896
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:23,860
Is your name Bharat Singh?

1897
02:08:29,020 --> 02:08:30,150
It's Bharat...

1898
02:08:31,770 --> 02:08:34,810
And my Pa's name is Gautam.

1899
02:08:35,150 --> 02:08:37,020
Your name isn't Bharat Singh?

1900
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:39,810
Are you not my Bharat?

1901
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:44,060
Why won't someone call my Bharat?

1902
02:08:46,720 --> 02:08:48,270
I'm sure you will meet your son.

1903
02:08:51,440 --> 02:08:53,360
All of this was a bloody time waste.

1904
02:08:53,710 --> 02:08:56,020
It's been more than
a month and a half.

1905
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:59,060
They seem to have found everyone...

1906
02:08:59,250 --> 02:09:02,060
Except my father.

1907
02:09:05,710 --> 02:09:07,560
Eat your food Bharat...
it'll get cold.

1908
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,310
I'm not hungry.

1909
02:09:10,690 --> 02:09:12,440
Pack your stuff...

1910
02:09:15,650 --> 02:09:17,690
We'll go back tomorrow.

1911
02:09:19,800 --> 02:09:22,650
Starving yourself is
not going to bring Pa back...

1912
02:09:23,590 --> 02:09:25,360
How long will you not eat?

1913
02:09:27,190 --> 02:09:30,270
Bharat, we are doing
everything we can.

1914
02:09:30,460 --> 02:09:33,020
It's been 48 years since
you separated from him.

1915
02:09:34,060 --> 02:09:37,020
God knows where... and how he is?

1916
02:09:37,610 --> 02:09:39,440
Whether he will be able
to come back here...

1917
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:42,150
He must be at least 80?

1918
02:09:42,730 --> 02:09:45,150
That too if he's still alive! No?

1919
02:09:49,310 --> 02:09:50,770
Alive?

1920
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:53,980
You're my friend...

1921
02:09:54,980 --> 02:09:56,560
Stay in your limits.

1922
02:09:57,020 --> 02:09:58,940
You know what your problem is Bharat?

1923
02:10:01,770 --> 02:10:05,230
You don't value who you have,

1924
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:08,190
the ones who are standing by you.

1925
02:10:10,370 --> 02:10:14,060
You've spent your
entire life waiting...

1926
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:18,360
And god only knows
if that wait will ever end.

1927
02:10:20,690 --> 02:10:22,190
Asking me to stay in my limits!

1928
02:10:40,810 --> 02:10:42,110
Come, let's eat.

1929
02:10:42,670 --> 02:10:44,150
I'm not hungry Bharat.

1930
02:10:44,440 --> 02:10:47,520
Starving yourself is not
going to bring my Pa back.

1931
02:10:51,570 --> 02:10:55,020
You are the only one
who gets me Vilayati.

1932
02:10:55,690 --> 02:10:59,190
We have just been contacted
by a lady in London...

1933
02:11:16,810 --> 02:11:17,980
Hello...

1934
02:11:20,310 --> 02:11:22,060
My sister's name is Gudiya.

1935
02:11:26,190 --> 02:11:28,270
I don't know my real name...

1936
02:11:28,710 --> 02:11:32,190
My Ma & Pa adopted me
from an orphanage in Mirpur...

1937
02:11:32,620 --> 02:11:34,770
And then we came to London.

1938
02:11:35,850 --> 02:11:37,940
They named me Meher.

1939
02:11:38,300 --> 02:11:39,440
Were you...

1940
02:11:39,990 --> 02:11:41,610
Did you stay in Mirpur?

1941
02:11:43,690 --> 02:11:44,940
I don't know.

1942
02:11:46,220 --> 02:11:48,020
I just remember

1943
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:52,060
we were running to catch the train

1944
02:11:55,280 --> 02:11:58,110
and my brother
was holding my hand tight.

1945
02:11:58,900 --> 02:12:01,270
Before we got separated
my brother said.

1946
02:12:02,110 --> 02:12:05,520
Gudiya... this isn't a carnival, okay?

1947
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:08,560
Don't you let go of my hand.

1948
02:12:10,190 --> 02:12:12,310
Don't you let go of my hand!

1949
02:12:12,910 --> 02:12:14,770
Don't you let go of my hand!

1950
02:12:22,150 --> 02:12:24,690
Gudiya has a mole behind her ear!

1951
02:12:43,370 --> 02:12:44,650
You have a mole.

1952
02:12:50,480 --> 02:12:52,650
He found his sister...

1953
02:13:08,500 --> 02:13:10,980
Why did you let go of my hand brother?

1954
02:13:12,570 --> 02:13:14,230
I'm sorry Gudiya, I'm sorry!

1955
02:13:14,630 --> 02:13:16,800
I tried but.

1956
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:20,860
I couldn't hold on to you...

1957
02:13:56,310 --> 02:13:57,360
Gudiya!

1958
02:13:58,360 --> 02:13:59,730
Where's my Ma?

1959
02:14:00,310 --> 02:14:02,110
I want to meet her.

1960
02:14:02,510 --> 02:14:04,030
Your Ma is alive Gudiya...
she's alive!

1961
02:14:05,530 --> 02:14:07,930
Bharat has found his sister!

1962
02:14:13,040 --> 02:14:15,280
He's found her!

1963
02:14:22,810 --> 02:14:24,810
He's found her!

1964
02:14:37,560 --> 02:14:41,810
Life is so crazy...
Kept looking for Pa,

1965
02:14:42,020 --> 02:14:45,230
but god reunited me with my Gudiya.

1966
02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:50,360
And the credit for this
goes entirely to madam-sir!

1967
02:15:09,300 --> 02:15:11,690
My Ma was my superhero.

1968
02:15:11,980 --> 02:15:16,860
For the first time
in 48 years I saw tears in her eyes.

1969
02:15:17,230 --> 02:15:21,860
She never cried all these
years so her children don't lose hope.

1970
02:15:22,360 --> 02:15:25,980
Today, after meeting Gudiya,
one half of all her wishes had come true.

1971
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:29,520
With the other half
of meeting Pa forever incomplete...

1972
02:15:29,690 --> 02:15:32,150
Ma left us for a better place.

1973
02:15:32,610 --> 02:15:36,060
Uncle Keemat also
left us 6 months later...

1974
02:15:37,400 --> 02:15:40,310
Now I became the eldest of the house.

1975
02:15:41,560 --> 02:15:44,020
The train is here. Bring out the cake!

1976
02:15:44,730 --> 02:15:47,060
The train is here. Bring out the cake!

1977
02:15:51,240 --> 02:15:52,990
What's under that?!

1978
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:58,830
Mr. Bharat, wish you a happy birthday!

1979
02:15:58,910 --> 02:16:01,780
The signal is down,
the train won't stop...

1980
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:03,490
Let's cut the cake fast!

1981
02:16:03,580 --> 02:16:06,370
Blow the candles! Blow them!

1982
02:16:07,510 --> 02:16:10,370
Happy birthday to you!!!

1983
02:16:10,450 --> 02:16:13,160
Happy birthday to you...

1984
02:16:13,240 --> 02:16:16,080
Happy birthday to you...

1985
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Ya Vilayati?

1986
02:16:33,080 --> 02:16:34,250
Bharat, where are you?

1987
02:16:34,750 --> 02:16:35,870
I'm at the store...

1988
02:16:35,950 --> 02:16:41,040
That Gulati has called for an association
meeting in the morning regarding the mall.

1989
02:16:41,490 --> 02:16:43,500
He's bad-mouthing you...

1990
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:47,870
What else do you expect
with such a foul mouth?

1991
02:17:03,620 --> 02:17:05,120
Right on cue!

1992
02:18:56,870 --> 02:18:58,000
Did Gulati send you?

1993
02:18:58,160 --> 02:19:02,830
If you ever set eyes on my shop,
I'll bury you alive punk!

1994
02:19:14,700 --> 02:19:18,290
In accordance with the
by-laws of this association

1995
02:19:18,830 --> 02:19:23,700
we will vote to decide if this market
should turn into a mall.

1996
02:19:23,940 --> 02:19:31,580
And the decision of this
vote will be binding on everyone.

1997
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:36,790
What's wrong Gulati?

1998
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,500
Cat got your tongue?
You look a little pale...

1999
02:19:40,330 --> 02:19:41,750
Don't you want to tell everyone...

2000
02:19:41,830 --> 02:19:44,380
That you tried to get me beaten up!

2001
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:47,320
Yes I did!
I sent those men to beat you!

2002
02:19:47,530 --> 02:19:51,070
Because
I can't watch my children starving...

2003
02:19:51,150 --> 02:19:55,110
And neither can any of them!

2004
02:19:55,400 --> 02:20:00,070
Everyone who wants a mall,
raise your hands!

2005
02:20:00,980 --> 02:20:02,400
Come on now!

2006
02:20:03,900 --> 02:20:05,070
Look at this...

2007
02:20:05,100 --> 02:20:09,240
This is the wind of change Mr. Bharat,

2008
02:20:11,030 --> 02:20:13,070
how will you stop it?

2009
02:20:13,810 --> 02:20:18,690
You can't stand
in the way of everyone else's future.

2010
02:20:21,610 --> 02:20:25,490
Long live Old Delhi
Traders Association!

2011
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:29,440
- Long live... long live!
- Loudly! Everyone!!!

2012
02:20:29,530 --> 02:20:32,400
Long live... long live!

2013
02:20:32,490 --> 02:20:34,990
- Long live... long live!
- Just a second...

2014
02:20:36,210 --> 02:20:38,750
But this land is yours...

2015
02:20:39,440 --> 02:20:41,920
And yet you will be
the builder's tenants?!

2016
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:44,500
Does that make sense to you?

2017
02:20:45,590 --> 02:20:48,000
Build a mall... by all means!

2018
02:20:48,420 --> 02:20:52,960
But don't let these foreigners
and builders make it...

2019
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:55,670
You and your association
will make that mall.

2020
02:20:55,750 --> 02:20:57,790
Excuse me! What are you saying?

2021
02:20:58,130 --> 02:21:02,130
Foreign investors are here...
Shut up you!

2022
02:21:02,430 --> 02:21:04,760
Why? Why will I shut up?

2023
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:06,710
Sit down quietly,

2024
02:21:07,340 --> 02:21:12,800
or I'll rake up a case and get you thrown
in jail for a non-bailable offence!

2025
02:21:13,720 --> 02:21:16,720
How dare you bloody
attack my family member?

2026
02:21:16,970 --> 02:21:22,960
I'll kick your bloody skull in!

2027
02:21:25,930 --> 02:21:27,090
- Too much?
- Ya.

2028
02:21:28,130 --> 02:21:29,130
Okay.

2029
02:21:29,780 --> 02:21:32,050
- So tell me friends...
- Calm down, he's a lawyer.

2030
02:21:32,130 --> 02:21:35,010
You want to be owners of your shops?

2031
02:21:35,350 --> 02:21:37,010
Or tenants?

2032
02:21:37,100 --> 02:21:41,330
Everyone who wants to be owners,
put your hands up.

2033
02:21:43,470 --> 02:21:44,700
He's right.

2034
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:47,580
I think he's totally right.

2035
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:53,410
- Why are you raising your hand?
- Have faith in me.

2036
02:21:53,660 --> 02:21:55,620
Still too much brother-in-law?

2037
02:21:56,610 --> 02:21:58,870
No. For once you
are just about enough.

2038
02:22:00,250 --> 02:22:01,710
Say with me...

2039
02:22:02,250 --> 02:22:05,290
Long live Old Delhi
Traders Association!

2040
02:22:05,370 --> 02:22:06,870
Long live... long live!

2041
02:22:06,950 --> 02:22:09,910
Long live Old Delhi
Traders Association!

2042
02:22:10,000 --> 02:22:12,720
Long live... long live!

2043
02:23:15,300 --> 02:23:19,010
Pa... they are demolishing the shop.

2044
02:23:21,670 --> 02:23:23,470
They want to make a mall.

2045
02:23:25,760 --> 02:23:27,380
It's the new India. A new Bharat.

2046
02:23:30,670 --> 02:23:32,300
I'm outdated now.

2047
02:23:34,450 --> 02:23:36,590
But that doesn't bother me...

2048
02:23:37,300 --> 02:23:41,160
I'm angry because I kept my promise...

2049
02:23:45,740 --> 02:23:50,340
I looked after this shop for years,

2050
02:23:54,260 --> 02:23:56,800
just because of your words.

2051
02:23:57,550 --> 02:24:00,800
"I'll come to Hind Ration Store."

2052
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:07,550
You made a fool of me Pa.

2053
02:24:09,220 --> 02:24:11,470
I can no longer stand

2054
02:24:13,380 --> 02:24:16,800
in the way of others' future

2055
02:24:21,230 --> 02:24:22,880
because of this promise.

2056
02:24:30,130 --> 02:24:33,510
I just hope and pray
that you are happy...

2057
02:24:37,150 --> 02:24:38,590
Wherever you are.

2058
02:24:40,300 --> 02:24:41,420
Bharat!

2059
02:25:00,940 --> 02:25:03,510
Hind Ration Store.
I'll see you there, with Gudiya.

2060
02:25:03,670 --> 02:25:04,760
I'll meet you there.

2061
02:25:41,170 --> 02:25:43,970
You think I didn't keep my promise?

2062
02:25:45,450 --> 02:25:49,060
I was always with you...

2063
02:25:51,970 --> 02:25:54,420
I knew I wasn't going to make it

2064
02:25:55,220 --> 02:25:57,070
when I got off the train.

2065
02:25:57,470 --> 02:25:59,420
What could a father do Bharat?

2066
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:05,100
I couldn't live with myself
if I left Gudiya behind...

2067
02:26:10,670 --> 02:26:13,130
Every child is as dear to a father...

2068
02:26:14,910 --> 02:26:17,050
You know why I named you Bharat?

2069
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:19,630
Nations are built by people,

2070
02:26:20,090 --> 02:26:23,130
and people are known by
the families they belong to...

2071
02:26:25,220 --> 02:26:29,090
And you kept this
whole family together.

2072
02:26:29,600 --> 02:26:33,670
I'm proud of you my child!

2073
02:26:37,590 --> 02:26:42,260
This entire nation
lives in you Bharat.

2074
02:26:50,040 --> 02:26:52,010
Too much time has passed Bharat...

2075
02:26:54,140 --> 02:26:56,170
You need to let go off me...

2076
02:26:57,340 --> 02:26:58,840
Right now, in this very shop.

2077
02:27:01,220 --> 02:27:03,220
And free yourself of my promise...

2078
02:27:05,170 --> 02:27:06,380
Of me.

2079
02:27:30,590 --> 02:27:33,840
Alive, you beat inside me...

2080
02:27:34,020 --> 02:27:37,720
And in you, I live and die.

2081
02:27:38,220 --> 02:27:41,590
Like a phoenix I will rise,

2082
02:27:42,130 --> 02:27:45,260
to break these chains and fly.

2083
02:27:45,530 --> 02:27:49,370
Hope is the strongest
power in the world...

2084
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:52,760
And this is what keeps us all alive.

2085
02:27:53,460 --> 02:27:57,630
Wherever father may be,
he will remain alive within me.

2086
02:27:58,000 --> 02:28:04,420
And I believe that our paths
will surely cross one day.

2087
02:28:07,030 --> 02:28:10,220
Alive, you beat inside me...

2088
02:28:10,550 --> 02:28:13,670
And in you, I live and die.

2089
02:28:21,190 --> 02:28:26,490
Since I have troubled
madam-sir the most...

2090
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:28,880
I love you, madam-sir...

2091
02:28:32,470 --> 02:28:36,970
Bharat if you're going
to propose marriage again,

2092
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:38,840
let me stop you right there!

2093
02:28:38,920 --> 02:28:42,220
It was my decision to live
with you without getting married,

2094
02:28:43,170 --> 02:28:46,050
so don't worry about it.

2095
02:28:46,260 --> 02:28:49,760
Anyway, it's 2010 Mr. Bharat...

2096
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:54,050
People don't frown at unwed
lovers living together anymore.

2097
02:28:54,630 --> 02:28:57,630
So, you don't want to get married?

2098
02:29:00,150 --> 02:29:01,170
Yes!

2099
02:29:02,670 --> 02:29:07,130
Yes meaning? You want to or you don't?

2100
02:29:08,360 --> 02:29:10,170
You think you are too smart, no?!

2101
02:29:14,260 --> 02:29:15,720
Okay, okay...

2102
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:21,010
If you are insisting so
