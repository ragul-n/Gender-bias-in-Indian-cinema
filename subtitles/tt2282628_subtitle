1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,060
You think you got
what it takes?

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:16,160
I only take the best,
because I am the best.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,770
If I hear whining complaining,
excuses, you're out!

4
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm not your mommy, so don't
come to me with complaints

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,710
about being tired
or it hurts too much,

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:28,540
'cause I'll just tell you
toughen up and shut up!

7
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:30,550
Am I clear?

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,150
You weren't recording that,
were you?

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,560
Oh, good.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,290
Ok.

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:44,560
Alright, girls, smile pretty
for the camera.

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,630
Good, yes.

13
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,690
Amy, suck it in!

14
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,560
Suck it in.

15
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,130
Ok.

16
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,570
Five, six, seven, eight.

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,110
Hi, I'm Maureen.

18
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,150
I'm the artistic director here
at Sashay Dance Studio.

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,590
Shoulders down.

20
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,840
Suck it in.

21
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,100
This is a little monument
to Ms. M, me.

22
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,470
I got this at nationals, and
oh, this is my theatre debut

23
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,870
in a chorus line.

24
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,620
Oh, look at that.

25
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,370
My portfolio from
my modeling days.

26
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,540
I don't know how that got
in there, that's just crazy.

27
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,510
Silly.

28
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:35,810
Stand up straight!

29
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,350
I am thrilled to announce
that this will be

30
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:41,750
the studio's 10th year in the
Leap 4 Your Life competition,

31
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,690
and there is not a doubt
in my mind

32
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,750
that we are going home
with the grand prize!

33
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,190
Sashay is most known
for our fierce seniors.

34
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,790
Thunder thighs!

35
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,130
Keep going!

36
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,730
This year, we have Hilary,

37
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,900
who is definitely
the star of my group.

38
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,700
Hi, I'm Hilary and I'm
in the senior company.

39
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,410
I wouldn't necessarily
say I'm the best dancer...

40
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,290
but others have.

41
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:08,180
I've been prepping all year
for this competition.

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,280
And I am just so proud of her.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,180
Her work ethic alone
makes her a star.

44
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,780
But I think her being the most
talented dancer

45
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,380
doesn't mean she is always the
most popular, and that's ok.

46
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,390
We're not here to make friends.

47
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:20,690
My baby is gonna be a star
one day.

48
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:21,790
Stop talking, mom.

49
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,420
Ok, sweetie.

50
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,230
Next is Brooke who,
unlike Hilary,

51
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,530
has a natural dancer's body.

52
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,170
But I've always said that if
things come naturally to you,

53
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:34,400
you never really want
them that badly.

54
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,810
Let's just say she's definite
runner-up material.

55
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:43,480
Hi, I'm Darcy.

56
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,410
Oh, and this is my daughter,
Brooke.

57
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,830
Hi.

58
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,250
And she's been with Ms. M for,
what, four or five years now?

59
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,520
But she definitely got
the performing gene from me.

60
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,890
♪ We are kings and queens
with golden dreams... ♪

61
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,660
Hey!

62
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,690
Carrie Underwood!

63
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,900
Zip it!

64
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,400
My head hurts.

65
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,430
Yeah, I just love being
on stage

66
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,200
and all the sparkly outfits
and...

67
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
Woah, woah, woah!

68
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,700
Slow down there, lady.

69
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:13,580
She's starting to sound like
a stripper.

70
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,910
And then there's our token
male, Matt,

71
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,750
who has those penis points
for the judges.

72
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,650
Hi, I'm Matt, I am the...
male dancer of the company.

73
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,790
I don't know why I put
that in quotations.

74
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,590
I'm Dan, I'm Matt's dad,
and, well,

75
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,230
this whole thing is kinda
new to me,

76
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,660
normally his mom brings him
to all this

77
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,870
but she's away this weekend
on a girl's trip.

78
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:39,200
You could say that.

79
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,530
So I'm holding down the fort.

80
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:46,610
But I'm very supportive of this
guy right here and his choices,

81
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,710
and I'm proud of everything
he's accomplished

82
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:51,680
and openly being who he is.

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,380
I'm not gay, by the way.

84
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,620
It's ok, son. I know.

85
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,640
I'm really not.

86
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,650
I just saw one of those
dance shows

87
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:58,990
and I thought it was pretty cool

88
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,720
so I just thought
I'd give it a shot, you know?

89
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,030
Sure.

90
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,790
Yeah, we'll go with that.

91
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,360
And then there's Molly.

92
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,000
Hi, I'm Molly and I'm a senior
dancer here at Sashay,

93
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,040
and this is my mom.

94
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
Hi, I'm Danielle.

95
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,840
I'm scared.

96
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,840
I know, it's weird.

97
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,440
Hi!

98
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:25,050
She's been with me the longest,
and um...

99
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,750
well, she really just
fills up space.

100
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,490
If you know what I mean.

101
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,050
It's my last year competing
here,

102
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,990
since I'm going to graduate
and go to college, you know?

103
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,660
Ok, listen up you guys.

104
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,400
I've got your jazz costumes.

105
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,540
That's for you, Brooke, Molly,
Hilary, and Matt.

106
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,740
These are cute.

107
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,970
Oh, um, Ms. M?

108
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,770
Yep.

109
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,070
This is M/L.

110
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,410
Yeah, I know.

111
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,080
But I'm S/M,
I'm the same as Brooke.

112
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,540
In what world?

113
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,480
Really? Watch that attitude,
missy,

114
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,050
because I saw you eat lunch.

115
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:05,890
She's the most animated
dancer here.

116
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,890
Like, when she's on stage,

117
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,990
you can not help
but notice her.

118
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,540
What's wrong, Molly?

119
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,090
You got a yeast infection?

120
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,960
Five, six, seven, eight.

121
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,560
Ms. M even said I'm the anchor
of the jazz group

122
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,430
and that's why she put me
in the back.

123
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:18,970
What?!

124
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:19,730
Yeah.

125
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,640
She did?!

126
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,600
Oh, that is so exciting!

127
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,400
I'm so excited,
I know!

128
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,410
Oh, she's an anchor alright.

129
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,740
Molly, I can still see you.

130
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:28,080
<i>A little to the right.</i>

131
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,450
Yeah, a little more.

132
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,450
<i>I can still see you.</i>

133
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,510
<i>To the right.</i>

134
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,780
I guess you could say I have
a reputation for being hard

135
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:36,950
on my students.

136
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:37,950
You got a keg in there?

137
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:38,790
No.

138
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,490
I want a six pack!

139
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,020
They want me to be hard.

140
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,990
And let me tell you,
the dance world is hard.

141
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,760
Believe me, all those tears
are swept away

142
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,730
once we clean out
the competition.

143
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,600
Oh, my seniors are fierce.

144
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:58,740
Oh, they better be ready
for us.

145
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:09,120
I think what sets my daughter
a cut above the rest,

146
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,390
aside from her incredible
flexibility

147
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,890
and Christian sensibility,
is her extensive training.

148
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:15,960
Isn't that right, baby?

149
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,730
Yes, mom.

150
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,490
Well, I've been dancing
since I was four.

151
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,000
I've always wanted to be
a ballet dancer,

152
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,100
and I've trained in tap,
jazz, broadway,

153
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,630
contemporary and lyrical.

154
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,700
I've done and won it all.

155
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,100
This will just be another
competition

156
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,840
under my ballet belt.

157
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,040
Sit straight and cross
your ankles, dear.

158
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,010
You look like a hooker.

159
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,710
Well, you can jam it
in your f...

160
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,480
Can I call you back, mom?

161
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,450
Who are you people?

162
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,090
Um, daddy?

163
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,560
This is my shot.

164
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,810
Speaking of shots...

165
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,060
Um, honey, why don't you
introduce yourself?

166
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,660
No, it's ok.

167
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,040
God, I hate dance
competition season.

168
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,070
I mean, you think it's bad
with that certain time of month,

169
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,080
you know, with your lady friend?

170
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,950
Well, times it by ten.

171
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,910
And add f@

172
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:19,390
Ah, ah, ah.

173
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,990
Oh, I just made some organic home-made blueberry muffins if you'd like.

174
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,890
Not only is she
a talented dancer,

175
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:26,930
but she'll also make a wonderful
trophy wife one day.

176
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,460
This is my camera time,
mom.

177
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,700
Don't be a brat.

178
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,170
Oh, love you, baby.

179
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:35,840
Love you, too.

180
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,640
Just shoot me.

181
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,980
You know, people always ask me
"what were the warning signs?".

182
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,520
But my son never played
with dolls.

183
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,090
The funny thing is, ever since
he was a little boy,

184
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:53,690
the kid has been obsessed
with balls.

185
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,520
Yeah.

186
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,760
All kinds of balls.

187
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,990
Baseballs, basketballs, bouncy
balls, balls, balls, balls.

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,030
Never the sport,
just the balls.

189
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,900
Isn't that right, son?

190
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,770
What?

191
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:06,700
That's my boy.

192
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,570
That is my boy.

193
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,940
To be honest with you, I
actually take a lot of offense,

194
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,610
the term "warning signs",

195
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,240
because there's a judgement
in that.

196
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,810
I love my son, whether he be
gay, straight, or bi...

197
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,810
lateral, the other one.

198
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,920
I mean, he's my son, you know?

199
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,880
I love him.

200
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,850
I just want him to be happy.

201
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,590
Not like my dad.

202
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:27,560
He didn't care what your
sexual preference was,

203
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,260
he just hated you for you.

204
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,590
<i>I'm going to get groceries,</i>
<i>does anybody want anything?</i>

205
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,700
Ow!

206
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,560
<i>Are you serious?!</i>

207
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,060
Dad!

208
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:38,480
I'll get...

209
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,900
I'll get the groceries, hon.

210
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,170
My husband is an idiot.

211
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,550
I've been sewing
Molly's costumes

212
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,880
ever since she was little.

213
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,750
I just love it.

214
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,620
And everyone's always so excited
to see what I'm gonna wear.

215
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,950
Yeah, I think it gives
her the extra edge

216
00:08:57,950 --> 00:08:59,150
with the competition, too.

217
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,560
Yeah, definitely.

218
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,720
Can you pass me the scissors?

219
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,860
Yep.

220
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,990
I've been inspired
with the 30's this year,

221
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,060
and the whimsy of fringe!

222
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,970
Yeah, I told my mom what
I was thinking of wearing,

223
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,770
but then we've been doing
lots of sketches

224
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,640
and, like, picking out fabric,
and it's been a lot of fun.

225
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,040
Oh, her solo is so amazing.

226
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,310
She's just improved so much.

227
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,080
Thanks, mom.

228
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,340
I really want to wow the judges
this year, and Ms. M.

229
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:25,110
My mom and I are actually
going to choreography

230
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,750
my solo together because Ms. M
said she was too busy,

231
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,220
which totally makes sense.

232
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,090
At first I was a little
disappointed...

233
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:34,060
Yeah, but then I told her
that she wouldn't do that

234
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,660
if she thought she couldn't
handle it.

235
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,930
And she can do it.

236
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:40,230
Like, she doesn't let Hilary
choreograph her own solo.

237
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,030
That's saying a lot.

238
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,830
I'm really hoping she's going
to be impressed.

239
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,830
Oh, there's no doubt.

240
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,830
Especially with this costume.

241
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,700
Yeah!

242
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,970
Sweetie?

243
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,970
Oh...

244
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:53,310
uh, sorry.

245
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,180
Honey, come.

246
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,910
Come say hi.

247
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,110
Uh, no.

248
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,780
This is your moment.

249
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,310
This is your moment.

250
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,180
Come on.

251
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,120
This is my dad!

252
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,350
Say hi.

253
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:04,150
Come on.

254
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,190
Hi!

255
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,690
He's a little shy.

256
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:07,620
How are you?

257
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,890
I'm John.

258
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,830
You don't have to speak
so loudly, dad.

259
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,400
Hi, I'm uh...

260
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,730
it's a pleasure to meet you.

261
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:19,800
Keep speaking, like normal.

262
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,280
Yeah, I pay for my
own dance classes

263
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,980
because money can be kinda tight
for me and my mom,

264
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,650
but you know what,
I really like it,

265
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,190
and the people here
are really cool

266
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:40,990
and they let me do open mic
on Thursday night

267
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,260
which is really fun.

268
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,960
Uh, this is $2

269
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,160

but musical theatre
is my favourite

276
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,910
and I'm really excited
for my solo this year

277
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,050
because I'm doing an original
piece that I wrote.

278
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,390

Ok, drop the rope in the tent.

286
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,400
Ok, assume the position.

287
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,000
We came up with our
own solution.

288
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It doesn't streak and it
gets that glow-y look

289
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,840
that is all the rage
with the stars.

290
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,970
Turn!

291
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,250
My technique is flawless.

292
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,180
Yeah, I am very excited
about the upcoming

293
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,490
Leap 4 Your Life competition,

294
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:21,190
it's gonna be a full on
guy's weekend,

295
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:25,430
but with dancing,
which is awesome.

296
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:27,830
But anyway, I got us all
stocked up on supplies here,

297
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,970
I got some uh bacon
for breakfast,

298
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:34,340
we've got steak for dinner
of course,

299
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,240
and a little bit of beef jerky
for a snack.

300
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,110
Dad, I can't eat that stuff
anymore, I'm a vegetarian.

301
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,040
Told you.

302
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,480
Oh, since when?

303
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,350
Like, last week?

304
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:45,900
Didn't get that memo.

305
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,450
Well, that's ok, we don't
need all this, we can...

306
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,980
I'll make chili!

307
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,050
Vegetarian chili.

308
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,850
Who doesn't like that?

309
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:51,450
Whatever.

310
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,290
Really?

311
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:53,350
Those are good.

312
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,820
Oh, Dan.

313
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,360
You got the wrong bread.

314
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,130
It's white bread.

315
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,130
It's for grilled cheese.

316
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,130
Since when have we...

317
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,960
we don't eat white bread.

318
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,100
You don't listen, seriously.

319
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,100
It's delicious, hon.

320
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,100
I don't know why I let you
out by yourself.

321
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,300
Honey, it...

322
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,970
ok...

323
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:18,010
just a little thing we do,
white bread games.

324
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,580
Um... my dad is, you know,
he's trying really hard,

325
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,980
I just kinda wish he'd
try a little less.

326
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,920
I mean, I kinda feel bad
for the guy.

327
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,160
Dan and I were high-school
sweethearts

328
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,190
and then in senior year
we got pregnant.

329
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,060
And surprise!

330
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,250
We had Matt.

331
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,430
Getting married was the worst
decision of my life.

332
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:40,970
I don't think that she...

333
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:42,270
likes me.

334
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:43,720
I mean, sure.

335
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,170
We love each other, I just
think it's one of those things

336
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:48,610
when I walk into a room
I can feel her cringe.

337
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:53,950
And that doesn't feel
that awesome.

338
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,080
So I've started seeing
other people.

339
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:59,090
We have an open relationship.

340
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,120
An open relationship?

341
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,960
No, we...

342
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,960
that's...

343
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,060
that's the first I've
heard of that.

344
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,130
We are just so honored
to have you here

345
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,200
and to celebrate our daughter
with you.

346
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,410
John here is leaving
for Hawaii tomorrow.

347
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:19,910
He's giving a speech.

348
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,380
Yes, I have my annual meeting,

349
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,980
but I'd much rather be here to
see Molly on stage tomorrow.

350
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:29,920
She literally lights up
the stage.

351
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,950
It's amazing.

352
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,920
John here is a psychiatrist.

353
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,160
Oh, and a great one!

354
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,060
I don't usually like to lead
with that

355
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,660
because of all the preconceived
notions.

356
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,430
Freud and Oedipus Complex
and all that is...

357
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,000
Yuk.

358
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It's actually how they met!

359
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,240
Tell the story.

360
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,970
Danielle was bringing
a friend to see me.

361
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,140
Poor woman.

362
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,010
She had a terrible phobia,
didn't she?

363
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,210
Doorways?

364
00:14:57,210 --> 00:14:58,590
Yeah.

365
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,970
In fact, it was so bad I don't
think I treated her

366
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,350
because she couldn't make it
from the waiting room

367
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,580
to the office.

368
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,050
Yeah, and it was only really
a few steps.

369
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,460
But there you were,
my Danielle,

370
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,990
just pushing her into my office.

371
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:11,630
Oh, yeah.

372
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,630
I was just pushing her!

373
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,460
Ugh.

374
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,100
It was so exhausting.

375
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:19,000
That's when I knew.

376
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,300
That's when I knew.

377
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,470
Sensational, really.

378
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:27,040
Aww.

379
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,410
Excuse me!

380
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,380
Can I get some service?

381
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,120
Oh, Brooke, I didn't know
you worked here.

382
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,750
Uh, yeah you did.

383
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,390
Don't be ridiculous, of
course I knew you worked here,

384
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,260
but I thought you were just
two days a week.

385
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,330
Oh, well normally I am but I had
to cover some shifts, so...

386
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,560
Oh, I'm sure, covered.

387
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,200
So, how's your solo
rehearsal going?

388
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,570
Um, well I haven't really had a lot of time to rehearse with Ms.
M

389
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,400
because of work
and stuff, so...

390
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,140
Weird, I've been rehearsing
non-stop,

391
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,370
not to mention all
the dance auditions

392
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,610
I've been doing for ballet
summer school.

393
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,410
I'm thinking I might
go to Europe to train

394
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,510
once I'm done my volunteer work
in Africa.

395
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,450
Oh, well, wow,
that is really cool.

396
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,020
Anyways, enough about me,

397
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,020
though it's so much fun
to talk about.

398
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,290
Aren't you going to ask me
what I want?

399
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,620
Oh, uh, yes.

400
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,110
What would you-

401
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,600
I'd like a medium, non-fat,
half-sweet long Americano soy misto.

402
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,370
Ok, and how about
for your mom?

403
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,110
She'll have a sparkling water.

404
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,410
Ok.

405
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,210
Oh, god.

406
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,650
That is just not a good look.

407
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:42,550
Should I get someone
to clean that up?

408
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:46,450
Oh, I guess you'd be
that person, huh?

409
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,020
Actually, don't bother.

410
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,290
I'm a little grossed out.

411
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,460
Just make that two
sparkling waters.

412
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:54,230
Thanks much.

413
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,630
Alright.

414
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,610
Mystery meat.

415
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,610
Looks great.

416
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,310
What happened to your lip?

417
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,050
Ask your son.

418
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,580
What happened to her lip?

419
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,320
Well, it was just this
little accident that happened-

420
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,720
Pass the beans?

421
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,550
Get the beans.

422
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,620
Here.

423
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,690
No, I'm good.

424
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:28,260
So, Bill, how are you feeling?

425
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,430
Constipated.

426
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,130
What? She asked.

427
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,370
How's it looking?

428
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,270
Does it look okay?

429
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,170
You can barely even tell.

430
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:39,010
Really?

431
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:39,840
Like, you wouldn't even...
right?

432
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,670
You wouldn't even notice.

433
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,710
You look beautiful, mom.

434
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:43,410
Yeah, you look great.

435
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,610
It looks like you got stung
by a bee.

436
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,650
It doesn't.

437
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:46,380
What?

438
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,120
Thanks, dad.

439
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,780
Oh, is that so terrible?

440
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,680
Let's just eat.

441
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,580
You look fantastic, sweetheart.

442
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,090
Yeah, yeah.

443
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:55,420
Don't touch me.

444
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,760
So uh, dad, Matt's got his uh
big dance competition tomorrow.

445
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,590
That's exciting, huh?

446
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,730
MMA is a competition.

447
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,200
Dance is not a competition.

448
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,630
Well, you should see
the leaps coming

449
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,000
from your grandson. Ok?

450
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,370
Because if that's not athletic,
I do not know what is.

451
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,800
Matt, you got any girlfriends?

452
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,240
Girls?

453
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,680
Uh, well just with my school schedule and dance and everything,

454
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,110
I haven't really had
that much time.

455
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,610
Dad, do you see
what you're doing?

456
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,680
Can't we just have
a nice dinner?

457
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,450
There is sort of one girl.

458
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,250
He's got a girlfriend!

459
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,500
He's got a girlfriend.

460
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:28,750
We're trying to have a nice
dinner here, dad.

461
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,860
We're proud of Matt
for who he is.

462
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,890
What, I can't ask a question?

463
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:33,330
I just want to know
about my-

464
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,550
It's not an issue.

465
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,760
We get it out there...

466
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,800
we're a family, I think we
should be able to

467
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,230
communicate openly-

468
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,800
Oh yeah, you're doing
a fine job of that.

469
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,370
If you've got an issue with
my son's sexual preference, dad.

470
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,610
Dad, I'm not-
Dad, I'm not gay!

471
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,890
See?

472
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,170
The house of lies
that you've created.

473
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,440
I knew you weren't gay,
I've always known it.

474
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,180
I- me too!

475
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,910
It's racism, but towards
gay people.

476
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,850
It's gaycism.

477
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:56,920
It's called homophobia,
dad.

478
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,690
It's called homophobia,
dad.

479
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,720
Gaycism. Is that even a word?

480
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,830
Can I get a beer?

481
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,460
We've seen you on beers, dad.

482
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,610
What?

483
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,760
Would you like me to go
get you some?

484
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,600
Matt, would you like a beer?

485
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,300
Sure.

486
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:13,870
Sure!

487
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:14,500
There you go.

488
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,270
Yeah?

489
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,940
Beers all around!

490
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,190
A man's drink.

491
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,450
Yeah, it's a man's drink.

492
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,710
Let's all get hammered
and lie about who we are.

493
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:20,910
That sounds great, dad.

494
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,340
Do you want to hit him in
the face, too,

495
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,740
while we're at it?

496
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,350
It's a bit of an unfortunate
situation, but...

497
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,220
I think his underwear
is a bit too tight.

498
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:34,250
♪

499
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,860
I like to put everything
into bags.

500
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,690
I make lists because that
way I just know

501
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,460
that I have everything
for tomorrow,

502
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,640
and I've already made
my lunch,

503
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,830
I've already made my mom's
lunch, and...

504
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,200
Brookie baby, oh.

505
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,470
Hi, boys.

506
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:47,720
You're new.

507
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,970
Honey, where's that cute
little top that-

508
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,270
Mom, what are you wearing?

509
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:50,970
What?

510
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,440
I'm wearing a towel.

511
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,910
Loosen up.

512
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:56,880
I swear to god sometimes,
she is not my daughter.

513
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,510
Where are you going?

514
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:01,520
I, miss nosy-pants,
have a hot date.

515
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,880
Mom, my competition is early
tomorrow morning.

516
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:06,070
I know!

517
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,260
Honey, I'm very excited
to see your little dance thingy,

518
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,760
and I know how important
it is to you.

519
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,460
So, I know.

520
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,490
Why don't you put on
Bridget Jones.

521
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,900
And then when I get home
at the end of the night

522
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:19,230
I'll catch the tail end
with you, ok?

523
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,970
Promise?

524
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,340
Promise.

525
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,740
Now, help momma find
a sexy outfit.

526
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,480
Mom, this leopard shirt is-

527
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,510
I love it, it's awesome.

528
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:40,350
Mom, have you seen
my good fishnets?

529
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:43,020
Ugh, I can't sleep, I'm
too nervous and excited.

530
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,830
I keep double checking
that I have everything.

531
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,290
Mom!

532
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,330
<i>Have you checked</i>
<i>your Ziploc?</i>

533
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,570
Found them!

534
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,440
She always gets
a little nervous

535
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,570
the night before a competition.

536
00:20:56,570 --> 00:20:59,640
Sweetie, how are you doing?

537
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,540
Ok, I want you to know that
I am proud of you,

538
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,710
and I want you to just go out
there and have fun, ok?

539
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,230
Ok.

540
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,750
So let's go over your number
one more time,

541
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,050
and we'll call it a night.

542
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:10,680
Ok.

543
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,350
Ok?

544
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,450
Ok.

545
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,390
Five, six, seven, eight.

546
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,430
Oh, hello.

547
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,630
I mean, namaste.

548
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,400
And welcome to my room.

549
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,340
I like to meditate and visualize
a win

550
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,640
the night before a competition.

551
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,710
It's something I've been doing
since I was three years old.

552
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,910
I also like to slip my slippers

553
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,910
underneath my pillow
every night.

554
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,850
They're kind of my
good-luck charm.

555
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:43,650
Shh.

556
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,560
Sweet dreams, I'll see you
in the morning.

So, today started like
any other day.

569
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,590
My little Molly is still buzzing
from last night.

570
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,990
Yeah, I am just so excited,
I look forward to this all year!

571
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,400
I couldn't sleep at all
last night.

572
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,930
And it's tradition that
we have pancakes

573
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,100
on the day of the competition,
too.

574
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,670
Oh, it's ok mom,
I'm not hungry.

575
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,140
What's wrong, sweetie?

576
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,610
I thought you loved
my pancakes?

577
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,440
I do, mom, it's just...

578
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Don't be ridiculous, sweetie.

579
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,410
Carbs are good for energy.

580
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:21,110
Don't tell Ms. M.

581
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,080
These are my favourite,
they're so good!

582
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:25,790
Oh, fresh out of the oven?

583
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,150
Tah-dah!

584
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,060
They look so good.

585
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,820
Just, like, one.

586
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,690
Ok, one more.

587
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:33,530
And maybe one more.

588
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:35,100
Ok, that's good.

589
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:39,000
Mom, we have to leave
in ten minutes!

590
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,170
Mom!

591
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,560
So, uh... today is the big day,
it's competition day.

592
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,060
Katie is just about to leave
for her girl's trip,

593
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:12,770
so that'll be fun...

594
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,930
Oh, is that her?

595
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,900
Is that you going, hon?

596
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:18,770
Love you!

597
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,770
So she's off on her girl's
trip, uh...

598
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,810
but she left me a whole list of
stuff to do to get ready, so...

599
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,080
I'm supposed to iron
Matt's shirt.

600
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:34,040
Ok.

601
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,990
Um, and then make sure that
his dancer belt is in the dryer.

602
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:40,660
Dancer belt...

603
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:46,570
ok, we'll figure that out.

604
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,770
But uh...

605
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:51,170
I will start with the ironing.

606
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,270
How do I turn this on?

607
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,010
Ow!

608
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:57,680
Heats up quick.

609
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Should be a fun day.

610
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,720
Darling?

611
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,890
Ready to go?

612
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,090
Yes, mom.

613
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:11,290
Everything's packed
and it's in the car.

614
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:12,890
Did you have breakfast?

615
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,630
No.

616
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,860
Excellent.

617
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,070
She should be like any second.

618
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:23,270
This is going to be
so much fun!

619
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,970
Oh, there she is!

620
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:26,940
Hi!

621
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,680
Shhhh!

622
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,140
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

623
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,010
Are you girls excited,
or what?

624
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,220
Yeah!

625
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,290
Oh my god, will you stop
with the yelling?

626
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:42,060
Why does it smell like gasoline
in here?

627
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:45,960
Let's go!

628
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,830
<i>I'm going to throw up.</i>

629
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:53,900
I like driving with my mom.

630
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,670
The other girls normally
carpool, but, like, no.

631
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,910
I like this time to relax
before the competition.

632
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:06,250
And I wouldn't want to cheapen
my daughter's talent

633
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:10,620
by having her ride in Danielle's
car, so...

634
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,760
And we're here, baby.

635
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,050
Hi!

636
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,800
It's Danielle, smile Hilary.

637
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,040
Oh, I can't, it's broken.

638
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,940
It's broken.

639
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,280
I can't...

640
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,180
yeah.

641
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,950
Oh, I'm sorry!

642
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:41,920
I'm so sorry!

643
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,120
Ok.

644
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,650
Yeah.

645
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:17,050
Today is the official
first day

646
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:19,250
of the Leap 4
Your Life competition.

647
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,990
I never get stressed
on the day of

648
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,890
because the work
is already done.

649
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:27,390
My team just has
to hopefully deliver.

650
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,160
It's out of my hands, now.

651
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,200
Ok, so we have Hilary,
Brooke, Molly, Matt...

652
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,200
where's Matt?

653
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,940
Where the hell is Matt?

654
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:42,880
He was supposed to be here
at 9 a.m., it is quarter after!

655
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,050
Don't just stare, people,
somebody call him!

656
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:47,850
Ms. M! Ms. M!

657
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,980
I'm so sorry I'm late, my dad,
he said he totally forgot-

658
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,420
I don't care what excuse
there is.

659
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,120
You can, and will, be replaced
if it happens again.

660
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,720
Do you understand?

661
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,460
Hey Maureen, sorry,
it's actually my fault,

662
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,190
I forgot his little Sashay
belt in the dryer.

663
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,200
No, no, no.

664
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,200
You will not keep me, or
my dancers, waiting again.

665
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,970
Is that clear?

666
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,900
Uh, yeah.

667
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,240
We're still, like, two hours
early-

668
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,270
Dad!

669
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,310
...before you start
dancing, so...

670
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,080
Step away from my dancers,
please.

671
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,110
I'm sure I can stay.

672
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,310
You're dismissed.

673
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,110
Beg your pardon?

674
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,980
Go get dressed.

675
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,380
All of you.

676
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,220
Go!

677
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,090
This is not ok.

678
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,860
Move along.

679
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,990
You know, I wrote the check,
so if we're gonna be five minutes late,

680
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,760
we're gonna be
five minutes late.

681
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,170
I like being prepared, and my
students need those extra hours

682
00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:41,130
to get stage ready
and warm up!

683
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,340
There is no excuse
for being late.

684
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,470
Ever.

685
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,980
Do what she does.

686
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,490
That's it.

687
00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:03,120
Beautiful.

688
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:07,090
Just do what she does.

689
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,370
Oh, Laine.

690
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,980
Good to see you.

691
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,310
It's so fun to be back
here with...

692
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,920
Leap 4 Your Life.

693
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,890
Maureen and I actually went
to school together.

694
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:34,450
She's uh...
she's a funny girl.

695
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:36,960
I don't think that's her
real hair colour.

696
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,360
Of course you know James?

697
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,230
How could I forget?

698
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,460
Hey guys!

699
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,030
Awkward.

700
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,370
I know.

701
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,230
So James used to dance
with Sashay

702
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
but then he moved to Sparkle
last year.

703
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,440
Ms. M was pissed.

704
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,370
Well, who can blame her?

705
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,510
He totally went behind
our backs.

706
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:57,380
Totally.

707
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,250
I didn't mean to hurt
anybody's feelings,

708
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,180
my family moved and Sparkle
was just closer.

709
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,420
Did they say anything
to you guys?

710
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,920
Well, we'll see you in there.

711
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,220
As we win.

712
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,930
Yeah, right.

713
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:17,600
Get ready, now.

714
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:23,040
Who was that?

715
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,170
Sparkle Dance.

716
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:25,970
Sparkle Dance?

717
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,110
They don't seem
very sportsmanly.

718
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:27,940
No.

719
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,580
Never-mind them.

720
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,210
Their minds are gonna be
blown with our new routines.

721
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,590
Alright, team, let's win this!

722
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:43,360
How do you even win
at dancing?

723
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,310
Big crowd out there, guys.

724
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,540
Getting exciting.

725
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,640
You're so talented.

726
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,180
Aw, thanks mom.

727
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:09,080
God, would you just...

728
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,150
just move over a little.

729
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,990
You can never over pack
for these competitions.

730
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:16,360
My make-up kit is like
my baby.

731
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:19,390
I guess you could say my mom
and I are pro at this.

732
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,630
With all the wins and
practice we've gotten,

733
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,030
why mess with a good thing?

734
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:25,900
What's wrong with you?!

735
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:26,630
I'm sorry, sweetie.

736
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,500
We're fine.

737
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:32,070
I've been up since 5:00 a.m.

738
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:34,270
I always go for my morning run
and do my full ab

739
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,210
and bar routine to start
the day.

740
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,380
I even forget to eat
breakfast sometimes.

741
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:41,180
She has such discipline.

742
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:42,620
I don't know where she got
it from.

743
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,120
Yes, there's a stigma of
eating disorders

744
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,620
or whatever you call them
in the dance world.

745
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,290
You won't find that in
my dance studio.

746
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,130
Nope.

747
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,600
Ms. M has me on
this no carb, no...

748
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,000
well really it's
a no nothing diet,

749
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,670
and so far it's working.

750
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,050
I am here to encourage my
students to be healthier,

751
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,250
which makes them feel good.

752
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:16,380
And, to be honest,

753
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,050
it makes my dancers look
more attractive.

754
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:20,690
Does that equal being
thinner?

755
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,620
Yes.

756
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,690
But who doesn't want
to be thinner?

757
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,360
Sweetie?

758
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,030
Do you need some help
zipping up your costume?

759
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,960
<i>No, I'm not doing anything.</i>

760
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,000
<i>Go away.</i>

761
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,430
Ok, I love you.

762
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,000
<i>Love you, too.</i>

763
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,170
Yeah, today was
a rough morning.

764
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,180
So Matt, your dad
is pretty cute.

765
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:46,250
Is he divorced?

766
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,550
Dad, don't!

767
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,650
It needs a little work,
like a faux-hawk.

768
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,080
Trust me. I know hair.

769
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,290
Ok.

770
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,570
I am uh...

771
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,840
I am very excited
about today,

772
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,120
I even bought myself a new book
to read, you know,

773
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,190
while Matt's not performing.

774
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,630
It's great, I mean,
I've already scanned it,

775
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:07,270
and it just talks about how
we're all different

776
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,300
and we should embrace
that difference.

777
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,410
And it's true, you know.

778
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:16,510
I mean, I like hockey
and beer and vagina.

779
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:22,580
And he likes tutus, five
o'clock shadow, and penis.

780
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,120
So, that's awesome.

781
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,650
I love it.

782
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:30,520
And I think he should just
go for it.

783
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:35,800
I'm not gay.

784
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,500
Uh, I mean, what other sport
do you get to watch girls change

785
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,730
and have them jump
all over you?

786
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:45,070
Oh, hey Matt, in my solo,
I do this, you know, thing.

787
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,570
Do you think this is too free?

788
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,040
No, definitely not.

789
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,310
Because I do this a lot, so...

790
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,980
I know.

791
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,650
Um, no, I don't think
it's too much.

792
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,080
No, it's not, hey?

793
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,550
No.

794
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,120
Actually, hey Matt, um...

795
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,790
could you do me up?

796
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,820
Uh, yeah. Sure.

797
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,190
This is done up like a bra.

798
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,230
Little clips.

799
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,330
Have you seen one?

800
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:11,160
What?

801
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:14,570
Dancing is a pretty sweet deal
if you ask me.

802
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:18,100
Ok, team!

803
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,370
I have a program.

804
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:21,140
I am not responsible
for your music,

805
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,140
and I will not tolerate
any screw ups

806
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,840
so make sure you have
your back-ups.

807
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:27,510
Hilary, you are first in
contemporary ballet.

808
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,320
Brooke, fourth in musical
theatre and Amy...

809
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,220
Where's Amy?

810
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,250
Here.

811
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:36,160
Put your listening ears on!

812
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,390
I will not say your name
twice again.

813
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:40,390
Understand me?

814
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,500
You begin the junior solos
in 45 minutes, so get dressed.

815
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,730
And point those awful feet
of yours.

816
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:49,190
You look great.

817
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,640
I hate teaching children,
but her dad insisted.

818
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,410
And, well, between you and me,

819
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:58,510
he's paying way above the asking
price for my choreography.

820
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,480
There you go.

821
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:06,650
I'm Julianna, I'm Amy's stepmom.

822
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:08,590
Don't touch me.

823
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:10,590
You know, it's just going to
take us a little bit of time

824
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,860
to get to know each other.

825
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,330
And that's ok, I can wait.

826
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:15,800
Right, sweetie?

827
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,300
I'm serious.

828
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,800
I'm going to tell my dad
you hit me.

829
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,340
She's just joking.

830
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,610
I don't really know all the moms
that well yet,

831
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,710
I mean, Amy is in the junior
dance company

832
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,610
and so I don't really know the
senior company moms that well

833
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:39,350
but they all seem nice.

834
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,790
I'm really excited about Leap 4
Your Life dance competition.

835
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,530
I used to be a dancer myself.

836
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,830
Yeah, I bet she was.

837
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:47,790
No, no, no.

838
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,860
Not that kind of dance.

839
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,430
I was a ballerina.

840
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:55,600
Well, I heard that she's
Mr. Brown's third wife.

841
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,040
His third.

842
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,470
And we all know he didn't
marry her for her brains.

843
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:02,810
Ladies?

844
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,580
Hi!

845
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:07,180
Hi.

846
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,850
I saved you a seat.

847
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:08,830
Oh, that's fine.

848
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:09,810
I'll just take this one here.

849
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,920
That'd be great.

850
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:16,590
Hi, I'm Dan.

851
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,460
Julianna.

852
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,430
Dan is quite nice.

853
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,760
He's quite lovely.

854
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:25,460

With two x's.

866
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:18,420
I am the host and coordinator
of Leap 4 Your Life.

867
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,550
Hello, hello everybody.

868
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,860
Ok.

869
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,420
How is everyone feeling today?

870
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:26,890
I love the stage.

871
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,400
Frankly, it's what brings
my wife closer and I...

872
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,500
What am I saying?

873
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,330
I'm nervous,
I'm on camera.

874
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:37,840
It brings my wife and I
very close.

875
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:44,580
It keeps us motivated, educated,
feeling things.

876
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,550
Yes, Rexx and I have been
married for ten years now.

877
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,950
Isn't that, like, a conflict
of interest?

878
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,450
How so?

879
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,420
<i>Well, you're married.</i>

880
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,470
Uh huh.

881
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,520
<i>And you're the host.</i>

882
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,820
Yes.

883
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,490
<i>So doesn't that put her</i>
<i>a step above?</i>

884
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,860
<i>Give her an inside edge?</i>

885
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,280
Mmmhmm.

886
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,700
I don't understand the question.

887
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,750
Rexx?

888
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,800
No, he seems like a great guy.

889
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,770
He's like a combination of
Liberace and Andre the Giant.

890
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,610
Um... which is odd.

891
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,440
Are you ready to see some
great dancing?

892
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,860
I can't hear you!

893
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:22,320
Are you ready for some
great dancing?

894
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,890
Alright, let's get this
party started.

895
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,790
First up in our junior
contemporary solos is...

896
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,490
welcome to the stage
Amy Brown,

897
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:40,000
who's dedicating this song to
her second mother, her new mom.

898
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,670
That's sweet.

899
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,900
Amy Brown!

900
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,540
Sashay Dance Company.

901
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,970
Alright, yeah!

902
00:39:14,970 --> 00:39:16,040
Woo!

903
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,770
That little girl rocked.

904
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,440
I wish more dances
were like that.

905
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,610
These things are always
so boring.

906
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,140
I even made a little tribute.

907
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,150
It's still in progress.

908
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:30,950
I'm Haydn and I'm
Hilary's brother.

909
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,790
Pretty sure I'm adopted.

910
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,920
I'm pretty much involved
because my mom forces me to be.

911
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,690
Oh, my son.

912
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,910
Yeah.

913
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,130
Um, well Hilary and Haydn
are actually twins.

914
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,560
Haydn, he's a tough one.

915
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:47,700
I think it must be really hard
for Haydn

916
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,600
to have such a talented sister.

917
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,470
We actually have a family joke.

918
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:54,440
We say that Hilary took
all the talent genes in utero.

919
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,510
Though, I'm starting to think
that might be possible.

920
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,810
It's the worst time
of the year.

921
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,850
I usually just draw to pass
the time.

922
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,610
In the old days,
Degas paintings actually,

923
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,540
ballet dancers were prostitutes.

924
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:34,810
So, my sister is a whore.

925
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,220
Essentially.

926
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,780
That was genuinely amazing.

927
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,780
Genuinely, that was amazing.

928
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,590
She is so overrated.

929
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,690
Unlike her, my daughter
will make it as a dancer

930
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,020
in the real world.

931
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,030
Yeah, my mom wants me
to pursue dancing,

932
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,730
but I have this other passion.

933
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,970
I really, really want to be
a country singer.

934
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:30,640
♪ 'Cause I'm young, dumb,
and having fun. ♪

935
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,710
♪ Can't stop me now,
I've just begun. ♪

936
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:36,910

you don't got. ♪

937
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:40,110
♪ Baby you can tell me but I'm
probably gonna disagree. ♪

938
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:43,680
I love singing, I love being
on stage performing,

939
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,690
but my mom thinks that I should
be more realistic, so...

940
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:50,920
she's probably right.

941
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,990

big mistakes to make. ♪

942
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:56,600

945

Hot!

946
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:11,240
She's a horrible singer.

947
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,010
Makes my ears bleed.

948
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,180
Well, I don't know about you

949
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,650
but I'm ten out of ten

950
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:20,050
interested in seeing
more dancing.

951
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:20,850
How about you?

952
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,820
Let's keep this
party going!

953
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:53,320
Boom, jazz in your face!

954
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:56,260
That was excellent.

955
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:00,060
Now an interpretive piece
from Molly.

956
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:06,030
I think that went really well!

957
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,930
There are no words to express
what it feels like

958
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:11,400
when you actually see your
little girl up there dancing

959
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,230
on the stage.

960
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:18,270
It's just so beautiful.

961
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,940
I almost threw up
in my mouth.

962
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,920
Well, that was very tribal.

963
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,750
Ok, if you would like to grab
a coffee or a doughnut,

964
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,990
or go number one or two,
now is the time.

965
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,190
A five minute intermission.

966
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,100
Have at 'er!

967
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,310
Ladies!

968
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:55,140
Hi.

969
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:57,380
So?

970
00:44:57,380 --> 00:44:59,310
What did you think
of Molly's dance?

971
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:02,450
Oh, well, Molly was...

972
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,720
good.

973
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:04,820
Yes.

974
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:07,850
I mean, her um...

975
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,150
shoulder stand.

976
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,990
I mean, wow.

977
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:12,890
Oh, thank you!

978
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:16,960
Oh, and Brooke and Hilary
were phenomenal!

979
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,530
Oh, thank you.

980
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,100
Yes, well, not everyone can
be as exceptional as Hilary.

981
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:26,210
Ok, well we'll see you back
in the theatre, ok?

982
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,210
Ok, yeah.

983
00:45:27,210 --> 00:45:28,340
I'll save us some seats.

984
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,270
Great.

985
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,510
Ok.

986
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:33,810
My god, what is wrong
with those two?

987
00:45:33,810 --> 00:45:35,750
I do not know why they let
her perform.

988
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,520
Well, it's just one less person
to compete with.

989
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,500
That's what I say.

990
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,490
Do you think she's slow,
by chance?

991
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:43,360
Oh, you're bad.

992
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:47,360
Hi mom, can I have a pop?

993
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:53,830
Hi.

994
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,200
Here.

995
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,270
And would you go out
in the sun?

996
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,300
Because you're pale.

997
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:04,040
That boy's really filling
out nicely.

998
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,410
What a tramp.

999
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,680
Wow.

1000
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,950
Have you ever seen
a sweater that tight?

1001
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,920
It's disgusting, really.

1002
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:15,820
Five, six, seven, eight.

1003
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:17,020
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

1004
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:19,360
<i>Sparkle Dance.</i>

1005
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,530
<i>Please.</i>

1006
00:46:20,530 --> 00:46:22,330
<i>Laine may have</i>
<i>stolen James,</i>

1007
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:27,830
<i>but her choreography</i>
<i>is mediocre at best.</i>

1008
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,140
<i>It still doesn't keep me</i>
<i>from being any less curious.</i>

1009
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,510
<i>Just what I thought,</i>
<i>they had nothing on us.</i>

1010
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:39,040
What I'm most excited
about is Matt and Hilary's duo.

1011
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:41,180
That is gonna be killer.

1012
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:43,120
They just need to find
the connection.

1013
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,980
If they do?

1014
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,250
Magic.

1015
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,460
Does that hurt?

1016
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,390
No.

1017
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:54,460
In a good way?

1018
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,090
No.

1019
00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:00,100
Yeah, Ms. M really wants
us to have a connection together

1020
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,250
but it's kind of hard

1021
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,400
because I think of Matt
more as a girlfriend.

1022
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:07,440
But, you know, besides being
a great dancer,

1023
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,910
I'm a really great actor.

1024
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,010
And I'll make it happen.

1025
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:13,450
She's hot.

1026
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:15,110
It'll be easy.

1027
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,320
Uh, do you want to try
the opening bit?

1028
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:18,120
Yeah.

1029
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,020
Sure.

1030
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:24,160
One more time?

1031
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:24,890
Yeah.

1032
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:27,930
Ok, cool.

1033
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:31,530
That's good.

1034
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,360
You warm?

1035
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,300
I'm hot.

1036
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,630
Burning up in here.

1037
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,900
I was really worried
about this number

1038
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:41,170
because I didn't want Matt
to feel uncomfortable

1039
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:47,350
or judged by the other kids,
but I took care of it.

1040
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:50,050
Matt, can I talk to you
for a second?

1041
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:52,520
Uh, yeah.

1042
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,420
Thought you could use this.

1043
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,560
For what?

1044
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,020
Just trust me.

1045
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:00,960
Ok?

1046
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,630
I thought he just needed
something visual to inspire him,

1047
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:08,430
hence the magazine,
so I slid it his way

1048
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,240
and it actually had
this neat thing.

1049
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:13,670
The centerfold thing was
one of the vampire kids

1050
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:16,340
doing crunches,

1051
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,040
which is actually
a great idea.

1052
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:20,180
Well, my daughter lives
for a challenge,

1053
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,350
so she will bring it.

1054
00:48:21,350 --> 00:48:22,980
Even if it means she has
to sleep with him

1055
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,980
to get a connection,
she will do it.

1056
00:48:24,990 --> 00:48:26,050
Really?

1057
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,290
She said that?

1058
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,560
Alright.

1059
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,630
Who would like to see
a double team?

1060
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,000
<i>It's</i>
<i>called a duo, you moron.</i>

1061
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,270
A duo!

1062
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:44,270
Matt and Hilary,
Sashay Dance Studio.

1063
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,460
It's really hard to dance
with a large erection.

1064
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:14,730
It throws off your equilibrium,
your jettes...

1065
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:39,620
He could actually even be
an actor.

1066
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:41,690
Did you see their romantic
connection?

1067
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:43,360
I mean, it's hard to fake
that when you have

1068
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,760
absolutely zero chemistry
with the other person

1069
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:48,600
and you find them actually
physically unappealing.

1070
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,600
And he totally sold it.

1071
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,540
I gave him a handy
before we went on stage.

1072
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,240
Should I get some of this sex
off the floor?

1073
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,310
Based on these performances,
I think we're gonna dominate

1074
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,210

1075
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,720
Especially with
my secret weapon.

1076
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:06,790

Yo yo, what up?

1082
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,300
My name is LL Smooth Moves,
as in "ladies love",

1083
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,200
which they do.

1084
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:28,770
And I am the hip hop
choreographer.

1085
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,630
Ha ha.

1086
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:34,480
This year, I decided to hire
the renowned LL Smooth Moves

1087
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:39,380
to choreograph an authentic
hip hop routine for my seniors.

1088
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:41,050
I think they're ready.

1089
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,190
Boom.

1090
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:43,420
You gotta hit that.

1091
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,820
I swear, I know him
from somewhere.

1092
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:48,130
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

1093
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:48,690
Lift up.

1094
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,630
Get her elevated.

1095
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,460
She likes that.

1096
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,300
You 18, right girl?

1097
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,060
I'm 16.

1098
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,230
Shit, ok.

1099
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,970
It just hit me.

1100
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,700
He was the stripper at my
girlfriend's bachelorette party.

1101
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,740
Stripper, that's a terrible
name for it.

1102
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:00,090
I'm a dancer.

1103
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:01,440
I'm a performer, you know?

1104
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,640
That's what I do.

1105
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,410
I dance around.

1106
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:08,150
People dance with clothes,
I dance without 'em.

1107
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:09,610
There's a difference.

1108
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:11,350
Not big.

1109
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:15,620
It's big, but you know...

1110
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:16,820
can you cut that part?

1111
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,660
Well, that's not real dancing.

1112
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,390
It doesn't even count.

1113
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,090
Five, seven, what comes
after that?

1114
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,830
I don't know.

1115
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,770
♪ Bruh, suh, boom. ♪

1116
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:28,800
♪ Siggity boom. ♪

1117
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,200
I love hip hop,
it's my favourite.

1118
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,770
Molly does do the best
in hip hop.

1119
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,340
I think it's her weight.

1120
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,340
Gets her more into the floor
than the others.

1121
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:42,250
This routine is gonna be sick,
it's gonna be off the hook.

1122
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:43,850
I got girls, I got a guy.

1123
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,220
Boom, boom.

1124
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:46,150
In between the thighs.

1125
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:49,520
Uh, uh huh.

1126
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,570
Yo.

1127
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:04,500
We here at Leap 4 Your Life
believe in keeping it real.

1128
00:52:06,410 --> 00:52:09,440

1147

My job as a teacher

1148
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,610
is to get my students ready
to work professionally.

1149
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:16,910
You have to know how to be
a video girl.

1150
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,380
Excellent!

1151
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:19,950
Excellent work!

1152
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:23,450
Excellent, team!

1153
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,980
Where's LL?

1154
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,790
Yo, guys!

1155
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:29,850
Yo, you killed it, y'all!

1156
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,960
Woo!

1157
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,920
Yeah, ha ha!

1158
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:33,730
Great job, guys.

1159
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:35,530
Yeah, it's kind of embarrassing
when my mom's hitting on guys,

1160
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:36,930
'cause it's
not like she's subtle.

1161
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:37,960
Brooke's mom?

1162
00:53:37,970 --> 00:53:40,430
Yeah, she's a total MILF.

1163
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,070
Ok, shh.

1164
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,670
We still have our
contemporary jazz number to do,

1165
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:46,270
so go get changed and
I'll check on you in a bit.

1166
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:49,940
Go. Go! Go!

1167
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,010
Good job.

1168
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,930
Like, I can't even bring
a guy home

1169
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:55,880
because she always makes it
into this weird competition,

1170
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,780
but she's the only
one competing,

1171
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:58,950
if you know what I mean.

1172
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:00,320
And I know my mom's beautiful,

1173
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,390
I know she's a MILF.

1174
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:05,790
But sometimes I just wish
that she was my mom.

1175
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,460
We can win this, we can win
this, we can win this,

1176
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:14,330
we can win this...

1177
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:16,270
Sweetie?

1178
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,940
I had to move things
around just a little bit,

1179
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:20,270
and your contemporary
jazz routine

1180
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:21,610
is gonna be put first
in the categories.

1181
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:23,040
What?

1182
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,910
No, that's like 15 minutes away,

1183
00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:25,840
there isn't time.

1184
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:27,160
You can't do that!

1185
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,480
I'm sorry, sweetie,
but Sparkle Dance...

1186
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,680
Sparkle my ass!

1187
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,720
Let me...

1188
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:33,850
Open up.

1189
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:34,990
Open up!

1190
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,460
No, no.

1191
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:48,870
I wasn't upset, I was frustrated

1192
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:52,570
at the unfortunate circumstance,
but there was no other option.

1193
00:54:52,570 --> 00:54:54,410
We had to go on earlier.

1194
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:55,670
I think you slipped at one
point, though.

1195
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:56,370
No, I didn't.

1196
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,230
Yeah you did.

1197
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,080
You can't be good
all the time.

1198
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,080
Ok, listen up!

1199
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:00,710
Listen up!

1200
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,380
They bumped up our dance,
we're on in 15.

1201
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,280
What?!

1202
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1203
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:05,080
There's no time for feeling
sorry for ourselves,

1204
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,720
just get ready, hurry up.

1205
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,750
Dance your hearts out.

1206
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:09,390
Go. Go!

1207
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:10,090
Oh my god!

1208
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:12,460
Go!

1209
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:21,670
Ok, next up...

1210
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,500
Sashay Dance Studio!

1211
00:55:24,910 --> 00:55:26,860
What?

1212
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,810
They're not supposed to be
on yet.

1213
00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:06,950
Put that away.

1214
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:18,860
Ladies and gentlemen, Sashay
Dance Company, Boom!

1215
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:20,890
Just hit your heart center!

1216
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,100
We did it!

1217
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,600
Break a leg.

1218
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:29,470
Thanks.

1219
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:30,870
No, actually.

1220
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,940
Oh, suck it up.

1221
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:39,540
It is so sad how badly
she wants to be me.

1222
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:41,480
Let's do this! Win!

1223
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,750
Ready?

1224
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,010
Ok! You can do this, right?

1225
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:44,680
Right!

1226
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,680
Right?

1227
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:47,920
Ok, energy!

1228
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,850
Don't mess this up.

1229
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:52,520
Go, go, win, win!

1230
00:56:57,830 --> 00:56:59,500
Did you see my dance move?!

1231
00:56:59,500 --> 00:57:00,100
That was so good!

1232
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,200
Shhh!

1233
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:04,800
Pack up your stuff, get ready
for the results.

1234
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,810
I have a good feeling
about this.

1235
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:08,640
Go, go, go!

1236
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:15,700
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

1237
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:19,520
that was a sparktacular way to wrap up this evening's competition.

1238
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:23,050
Next up will be the gala,
so you've got an hour break.

1239
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,820
Take your time, freshen up,
do what you must,

1240
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:30,660
but hurry on back because we'll
be announcing the winners

1241
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:33,230

It's kind of like a second prom
to many of these dancers.

1248
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,990
I think I'm going to be
the most sad

1249
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,190
that I'm not gonna see
my friends every day

1250
00:58:01,190 --> 00:58:04,230
when we graduate
from Sashay.

1251
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,600
Especially Hilary.

1252
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:09,600
Her and I are definitely
besties.

1253
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,270
Eww. No!

1254
00:58:11,270 --> 00:58:12,940
Molly just stares at me.

1255
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:16,070
It's creepy.

1256
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:17,940
So does her mom.

1257
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,010
Like, I get it, I'm beautiful
and talented,

1258
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:23,620
but, like, close your mouth when
you're looking at me, you know?

1259
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:28,150
I like your dress.

1260
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:30,990
It's ok, it's ok.

1261
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:34,030
Breathe.

1262
00:58:34,030 --> 00:58:35,060
It's the same dress.

1263
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,130
She's fat.

1264
00:58:36,130 --> 00:58:38,830
It really doesn't bother me,

1265
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:41,530
Hilary is the one that makes
everything into a competition.

1266
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,700
And to be honest, I kinda
think it looks better on me.

1267
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:45,670
She'll always be runner up,

1268
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:48,640
so just wait until I clean up
at the awards.

1269
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:51,740
Actually, Hilary said we weren't
dressing up for the gala,

1270
00:58:51,750 --> 00:58:52,910
so I didn't.

1271
00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:55,850
I would have dressed up too,
but I like,

1272
00:58:55,850 --> 00:58:58,050
I think this is more fancy.

1273
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:01,050
Like, 'cause they're
low cut so...

1274
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:03,960
and I did the braid.

1275
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,770
It's ok.

1276
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,590
My mom says it looked good.

1277
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:13,260
You need to tighten
your tie.

1278
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:14,230
I just told him that.

1279
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:15,350
I know.

1280
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:16,460
It looks better this way.

1281
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:17,570
Oh, honey, you're wearing
my dress.

1282
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:19,100
Yeah.

1283
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,770
It's a little slutty.

1284
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:22,040
Just saying.

1285
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,910
You look great.

1286
00:59:24,340 --> 00:59:25,310
Sashay Dance Company!

1287
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:27,980
Come, come, gather, gather.

1288
00:59:29,850 --> 00:59:38,120
I just wanted to say I am proud
of all of you,

1289
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,290
no matter what.

1290
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:41,240
And when they call
your name,

1291
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,190
remember to cry and really
act shocked

1292
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,130
so we really drive home the fact
that we're humble.

1293
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:45,760
Oh, yeah.

1294
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:46,700
Yeah?

1295
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,170
Ok, good.

1296
00:59:48,170 --> 00:59:50,840
Let's get out there and
clean off that trophy table!

1297
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,670
Yeah! Yeah!

1298
00:59:53,370 --> 00:59:54,740
Sashay Sashay Sashay!

1299
00:59:54,740 --> 00:59:57,680
Woooo!

1300
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:04,050
And now, for the moment
you've all been waiting for.

1301
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:05,380
The results!

1302
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:09,120
But first, let's give a big
round of applause

1303
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,860
to all our amazing contestants
for their hard work.

1304
01:00:20,770 --> 01:00:24,740
Alright, shall we get down
to business?

1305
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:27,070
I said, should we get
down to business?!

1306
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:31,410
Drum roll please, dancers.

1307
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:39,820
And first up, in the category
of junior contemporary solo is

1308
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:44,320
Liam from Sparkle Dance Co.

1309
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,660
Penis points, every time.

1310
01:00:56,770 --> 01:00:59,870
Oooh, drama.

1311
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:03,140
No, we didn't win,
but that's ok.

1312
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,740
She won in my books,
didn't you, sweetie?

1313
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:08,380
My dad only married you
for your boobs.

1314
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,080
Uh...

1315
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:17,820
First up, for senior
contemporary ballet is...

1316
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:22,190
Hilary from Sashay
Dance Studio.

1317
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:30,770
Her talent.

1318
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:35,370
You're all very lucky to get
a chance to be in her midst.

1319
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:40,410
Best duo goes to...

1320
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:46,880
Hilary and Matt from Sashay
Dance Studio for Inception!

1321
01:01:46,890 --> 01:01:49,020
What'd I tell you?

1322
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,640
I'm proud of him.

1323
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,260
When I was a kid, I told my dad
I wanted to be a hockey player

1324
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,930
and he told me that'll
never happen.

1325
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:59,160
You're too small,
you're uncoordinated,

1326
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,000
and you're too much of a wimp.

1327
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,100
Then he punched me in the face
and I started to cry.

1328
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,170
He said "See?

1329
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:10,410
You can't cry in hockey,
wimp."

1330
01:02:10,410 --> 01:02:13,180
Ooh, the tension is palatable.

1331
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:21,150
Up next, my favourite award,
best personality, goes to...

1332
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:24,290
Molly from Sashay
Dance Company!

1333
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,190
Woooo!

1334
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:30,360
Ok, that's an excited mother.

1335
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:32,300
And now she's on stage.

1336
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:36,000
We discourage this everyone...

1337
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:40,070
It's so in our hearts,
you know?

1338
01:02:40,070 --> 01:02:43,170
Because she's so meant to do
this, she's so talented.

1339
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:45,140
The moms are on the stage.

1340
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:48,380
Ok, that was a little
enthusiasm.

1341
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:50,350
I would have gone with it...

1342
01:02:54,190 --> 01:02:56,820
Ok.

1343
01:02:58,390 --> 01:03:00,320
It was a pity prize.

1344
01:03:00,330 --> 01:03:03,260
Now, let's move onto groups.

1345
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:07,870
For best hip hop, we seem
to have a disqualification.

1346
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:10,370
It appears that Sashay Dance
Studio is disqualified

1347
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:13,140
on the grounds of
age inappropriateness.

1348
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:14,510
What?!

1349
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:17,240
Yeah, I wasn't too surprised
about that one.

1350
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:21,350
So, by default, the winner
is Sparkle Dance Co.

1351
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:29,700
We won!

1352
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,960
I'm not gonna lie, I was
really scared there.

1353
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:35,030
They were doing moves
I'd never seen before.

1354
01:03:35,030 --> 01:03:38,060
Like, I don't think
I'd be allowed to.

1355
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,930
It's unbelievable, I have never
heard of that before.

1356
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:42,970
But I told Maureen
not to do hip hop.

1357
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:45,970
I said our dancers are
serious contemporary dancers,

1358
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:47,290
not video hoochies.

1359
01:03:47,290 --> 01:03:48,610
Would she listen? No.
So there you go.

1360
01:03:48,610 --> 01:03:51,310
Oh my... are you...?

1361
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:54,280
Don't get too upset or
your Spanx might break.

1362
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,420
Listen up, thunder thighs,
your cheap box steps might work

1363
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:59,450
with these simple-minded
judges,

1364
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:01,480
but they aren't going to take
my chances at my trophy.

1365
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:03,120
Got it?

1366
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:04,360
Look at them.

1367
01:04:04,360 --> 01:04:05,990
I won.

1368
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:07,430
Me.

1369
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:08,860
Your breasts just touched me,
I don't like that.

1370
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:12,060
Your breath stinks.

1371
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:13,460
Your hair smells good, though.

1372
01:04:13,470 --> 01:04:14,900
I know. I love it.

1373
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:16,500
What is that?

1374
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,900
And now, can someone bring out

1375
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:20,370
the ultimate grand
supreme trophy?

1376
01:04:20,370 --> 01:04:22,540
Oh, there it is.

1377
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:26,230
I'm just gonna go
to the washroom.

1378
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:29,910
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

1379
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,950
The winner of the ultimate
grand supreme trophy

1380
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:39,890
and $100 gift certificate
to the Olive Garden...

1381
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:41,530
I love those cheese buns.

1382
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,500
Is...

1383
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:05,280
Sashay Dance Studio!

1384
01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:06,680
Yes!

1385
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:09,020
Yes! Yes!

1386
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:11,920
Ladies and gentlemen,
can you believe this?

1387
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:14,260
Sashay Dance Company
has won the grand prize

1388
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:16,160
a consecutive ten years
in a row,

1389
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:20,000
which is basically unheard of.

1390
01:05:21,030 --> 01:05:24,500
Yes! Yes!

1391
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:33,040
Honey, I love you.

1392
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,680
Thank you for all your efforts.

1393
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:41,420
This is Rexx, with two x's,

1394
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,690
singing off from
the tenth annual

1395
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:45,620
Leap 4 Your Life competition,

1396
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:47,630
I looked at all of you in
the eye at some point tonight,

1397
01:05:47,630 --> 01:05:48,960
you're all lovely.

1398
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:50,660
Let's connect soon again.

1399
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:53,700
Until next year,
keep it snappy.

1400
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:54,670
Where's my mom?

1401
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:01,140
What? They won?

1402
01:06:01,140 --> 01:06:03,510
I didn't know.

1403
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:26,700
A lot has happened since the
Leap 4 Your Life competition.

1404
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,170
Um...

1405
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:31,440
Matt's mom and I officially
separated.

1406
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,140
Um, so that's been
a bit tough,

1407
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:35,170
but it's for the best.

1408
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:39,380
She's much happier
with her new guy, so that's...

1409
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:41,360
and we're friends.

1410
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,350
We're still friends, you know,
as much as you can be

1411
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:48,750
while feeling completely
demasculinized.

1412
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:52,060
But you know, it was actually
Matt who convinced me

1413
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:55,360
to get out there and start
dating again,

1414
01:06:55,360 --> 01:06:59,030
and I was kind of nervous
and skeptical,

1415
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:05,600
but it turns out I met someone,
and she's kind of special.

1416
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:08,510
I mean, we're just, you know,
we're taking it slow,

1417
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:12,280
but it's exciting.

1418
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:18,050
And for the first time
in a long time I'm happy.

1419
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:20,380
Yes, Mr. Brown and I did
break up,

1420
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:26,620
but that's ok because Dan
has been so amazing.

1421
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,330
And so positive.

1422
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:32,130
Especially with everything
going on with Matt.

1423
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:37,400
And also he's a really
good kisser.

1424
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:40,340
My dad has just been
incredibly supportive.

1425
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,340
As soon as he found out that
Hilary and I were expecting,

1426
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:45,310
he insisted that we move
into the basement rent free.

1427
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,810
It's been incredible.

1428
01:07:48,350 --> 01:07:49,710
Hey, sweetie.

1429
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,750
Especially since we found
out we were having twins!

1430
01:07:52,750 --> 01:07:55,320
That was a shocker, hey?

1431
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,550
I hate you.

1432
01:07:56,560 --> 01:07:59,090
That's just a little joke
that we have.

1433
01:07:59,090 --> 01:08:00,660
We go back and forth.

1434
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,230
I hate you, I love you,
I hate you, I love you.

1435
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:04,230
No.

1436
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:05,530
It's just like pet names.

1437
01:08:05,530 --> 01:08:06,730
Hey, buddy.

1438
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:09,700
She's just a little tired.

1439
01:08:09,700 --> 01:08:12,500
The babies wake up every hour,
so...

1440
01:08:12,510 --> 01:08:14,240
Hey honey, show them
the ring.

1441
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:16,240
Show them the ring.

1442
01:08:23,550 --> 01:08:25,820
Yeah, I had to quit dancing
and get a real job

1443
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:28,150
to support Hilary
and the little family,

1444
01:08:28,150 --> 01:08:30,450
but I love landscaping.

1445
01:08:30,460 --> 01:08:31,660
It's awesome.

1446
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:33,790
To be out in the sunshine,
sweatin',

1447
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:36,690
getting dirty with the boys,
you know.

1448
01:08:39,170 --> 01:08:40,900
My dad's still on this whole gay
thing though,

1449
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,900
it's ridiculous.

1450
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:44,900
I guess I just don't have
the heart to tell him that

1451
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:46,500
I'm straight.

1452
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:49,670
I guess I don't want to
disappoint him or something.

1453
01:08:51,910 --> 01:08:54,210
Look at those chatty Cathys.

1454
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:56,610
People make mistakes.

1455
01:08:56,620 --> 01:08:59,720
You learn from them. Right?

1456
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,190
Matt did, you know?

1457
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:05,390
He got Hilary pregnant.

1458
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:07,390
Do I love him any less?

1459
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:09,630
Absolutely not.

1460
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:12,260
In fact, there's just a lot more
to love.

1461
01:09:12,270 --> 01:09:14,400
Right fellas?

1462
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,830
Yeah, and you know what?

1463
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:17,270
It's helped me make some
new friends.

1464
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:20,670
I joined a group, grandpas
under 40.

1465
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:23,770
We get together and have
a great time, don't we?

1466
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:28,410
Look at this, we've got our own
little team going here.

1467
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:30,250
They're so tiny!

1468
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,720
They're like little footballs,
you know?

1469
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:34,550
Just huck 'em over, go long!

1470
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:35,670
No, I wouldn't.

1471
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:36,790
I was just joking.

1472
01:09:36,790 --> 01:09:38,520
I wouldn't do that.

1473
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:40,790
I wouldn't throw a child.

1474
01:09:42,530 --> 01:09:47,200
He's like "You've got
no nipples, I'm hungry.

1475
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,470
Where's mommy?".

1476
01:09:49,470 --> 01:09:51,740
I don't know where she is,
so we're just hanging out.

1477
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:54,240
Yeah, I'm not dancing anymore.

1478
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:57,780
Since I'm fat now and I have
these demon babies.

1479
01:09:57,780 --> 01:10:00,280
Apparently being a twin
increases your chances

1480
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:01,610
of having twins.

1481
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:03,580
It's like mother nature's
sick joke.

1482
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:06,570
I don't even want to be
living here,

1483
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:09,550
but my mother has completely
disowned me so whatever.

1484
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,420
Oh, no I don't have
a daughter.

1485
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:13,790
My daughter would never get
herself knocked up by some fairy

1486
01:10:13,790 --> 01:10:15,460
and then throw away
her entire dance career

1487
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,560
just because she didn't realize

1488
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,660
you have to keep your food down
for birth control to work.

1489
01:10:19,670 --> 01:10:20,800
No.

1490
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:26,700
I do have a brilliant artist
of a son.

1491
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:32,440
He just feels things on such
a deep level,

1492
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:34,550
it comes across in his work.

1493
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:35,910
He's having a gallery
show soon

1494
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,850
and I know it will be brilliant.

1495
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:42,620
I'm just so proud of him.

1496
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:43,550
Stop talking, mom.

1497
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:45,520
Ok, dear.

1498
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:48,790
Oh, I know.

1499
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,830
I heard about Hilary.

1500
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:52,860
Karma.

1501
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:54,930
Anyways, things have been
going really,

1502
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:56,570
really well with me.

1503
01:10:56,570 --> 01:10:57,940
I moved to Nashville to live
with my dad

1504
01:10:57,940 --> 01:10:59,540
and I entered this
singing competition

1505
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:02,440
just on a whim and I won.

1506
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,580
I landed a record deal, and I'm
now recording my first album.

1507
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:08,350
I'm doing all of these
interviews,

1508
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:13,420
all of these concerts, and my
first single is on the radio.

1509
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:16,050
This is all a dream come true
for me.

1510
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,560
Hey, did my mom call
by any chance?

1511
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,430
<i>No, sorry sweetie.</i>

1512
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:26,430
Anyways, I have to go, I
have a sound check right away

1513
01:11:26,430 --> 01:11:28,730
and I'm opening up
for Carrie Underwood,

1514
01:11:28,730 --> 01:11:30,400
so wish me luck!

1515
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:30,870
Or, no.

1516
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,740
Break a leg.

1517
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:33,900
Still getting used to all this.

1518
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:52,790
Yo, yo, LL Smooth Moves here.

1519
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:55,530
Check it man, we got some
big things to talk about,

1520
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:57,590
besides this hottie to my left.

1521
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,900
Uh, to your right.

1522
01:11:58,900 --> 01:12:01,200
Right.

1523
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:03,500
Hi, I'm sure you've all heard
about LL's internet success,

1524
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,100
he's the latest
online rapper sensation.

1525
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,620
Look, I'm not making any
money off these videos yet,

1526
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:25,960
but uh... never say never.

1527
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,990
Right beebs?

1528
01:12:27,990 --> 01:12:30,390
Well, you know, now I'm his
manager and producer

1529
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:32,400
and things are going great.

1530
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,130
I mean, I know talent
when I hear it.

1531
01:12:35,130 --> 01:12:39,040
Even if it meant re-mortgaging
my house.

1532
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:40,540
I'll pay you back.

1533
01:12:40,540 --> 01:12:42,110
Yes.

1534
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:47,110
And now we're living the dream,
baby, here in Florida.

1535
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:49,610
Yeah, we had to move due
to legal complications.

1536
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:50,710
We don't have to talk
about that.

1537
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:52,620
Yeah, we do have
to talk about it.

1538
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:53,950
The truth must come out.

1539
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:55,390
They blew this whole thing
out of the water, man.

1540
01:12:55,390 --> 01:12:56,650
They don't understand
my process,

1541
01:12:56,660 --> 01:12:57,870
you know what I'm sayin'?

1542
01:12:57,870 --> 01:12:59,090
When you teachin' someone
a robot,

1543
01:12:59,090 --> 01:13:01,760
I have to get on top of you?

1544
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:03,790
I made bubbles.

1545
01:13:05,130 --> 01:13:07,830
Hi, it's great to see you again.

1546
01:13:07,830 --> 01:13:09,500
This is Sammy.

1547
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,800
Sammy, say hi!

1548
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:14,670
It's been quite the busy
12 months, actually.

1549
01:13:14,670 --> 01:13:16,970
Yeah, as you know Molly
got her braces off.

1550
01:13:16,980 --> 01:13:20,140
Ok, Molly. I haven't seen you
in a while.

1551
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:21,450
Yeah.

1552
01:13:21,450 --> 01:13:23,450
I see that your breasts
are coming in.

1553
01:13:23,450 --> 01:13:25,180
So that, and getting
your braces off,

1554
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:28,420
will make you very popular
with the boys.

1555
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:30,720
Let's have a look.

1556
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:32,820
Ok.

1557
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:38,700
Huh. That's weird.

1558
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:40,760
They should have come off
a year ago.

1559
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:43,800
Oh, it's so hard to watch
your baby grow up.

1560
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:47,500
I just thought she looked
so cute with her braces on.

1561
01:13:47,510 --> 01:13:49,710
Ow, that really hurt.

1562
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,540
They feel so weird.

1563
01:13:53,550 --> 01:13:58,120
<i>Yeah, look out boys,</i>
<i>here comes Molly.</i>

1564
01:13:58,120 --> 01:13:59,850
I feel so free.

1565
01:13:59,850 --> 01:14:02,550
We're very sad to see her go
away to university.

1566
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:07,020
I just channelled all that
negative energy, and, well,

1567
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:09,990
I just started teaching kids
dance at Ms. M's studio.

1568
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,200
It isn't much,
but it's amazing.

1569
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,170
I'm all about building
self-esteem and having fun,

1570
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:21,710
and oh, the kids just love it
and I feel so alive

1571
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:24,480
and I'm just so happy.

1572
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:27,610
And without Molly being
here, well,

1573
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:30,780
we don't have to lock
the door anymore.

1574
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,750
Yeah, things have been going
great since Leap.

1575
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,490
I was really nervous
about moving away

1576
01:14:39,490 --> 01:14:41,890
but I really think it's been
for the best.

1577
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:44,830
I mean, at first I was
feeling kinda down

1578
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:47,000
about not having that solid
group of friends anymore,

1579
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,130
but then I found out
about the sororities here

1580
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:50,670
and honestly it's been awesome.

1581
01:14:50,670 --> 01:14:51,900
Like, the girls are
just so nice

1582
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:55,010
and it's like having one
big sleep over.

1583
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,010
Molly!

1584
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:00,940
Oh, hey!

1585
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:02,210
M-town.

1586
01:15:02,210 --> 01:15:03,110
What?

1587
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,850
Nothing.

1588
01:15:05,850 --> 01:15:08,790
Molly, how's it going?

1589
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:10,120
Good.

1590
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:10,950
Just going to class.

1591
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:11,860
Oh cool, me too.

1592
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:12,760
I'll walk with you.

1593
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,680
Yeah.

1594
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,590
But first I would like
to ask you a question.

1595
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,130
Sure.

1596
01:15:22,070 --> 01:15:27,240
I was wondering, later,
if you weren't... busy,

1597
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:28,840
we could grab a bite
to eat?

1598
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,810
Or a bite to drink,
or something?

1599
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:32,610
Uh, yeah!

1600
01:15:32,610 --> 01:15:34,210
Yeah, I would love that.

1601
01:15:34,210 --> 01:15:36,210
Awesome, cool, great!

1602
01:15:36,220 --> 01:15:37,110
Cool.

1603
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,720
Yeah.

1604
01:15:39,720 --> 01:15:40,720
Awesome.

1605
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,650
Let's uh, go to class.

1606
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,120
Cool.

1607
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:50,660
It's a bee.

1608
01:15:50,660 --> 01:15:51,630
I'm allergic.

1609
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:53,200
Oh, no.

1610
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:59,900
A lot has happened since
last year's Leap 4 Your Life.

1611
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:03,940
Lots of press
and new students.

1612
01:16:03,940 --> 01:16:06,780
All kinds of amazing
opportunities coming in

1613
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,350
for my dancers.

1614
01:16:08,350 --> 01:16:10,810
I can't go into detail
about everything

1615
01:16:10,820 --> 01:16:13,650
because of legal mumbo jumbo,
but...

1616
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,320
Broadway.

1617
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:19,690
It's exciting, and things
are going wonderfully indeed.

1618
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:21,290
Indeed.

1619
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:27,900
I do, I do have to... you're
in my space.

1620
01:16:27,900 --> 01:16:31,940
I have to say that I am
really proud of everything

1621
01:16:31,940 --> 01:16:34,810
that I have accomplished.

1622
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:36,370
We.

1623
01:16:36,380 --> 01:16:38,080
We have accomplished.

1624
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:39,310
Together.

1625
01:16:39,310 --> 01:16:41,350
No, it's definitely me.

1626
01:16:41,350 --> 01:16:43,610
Tomato tomato.

1627
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:45,950
Can of soup.

1628
01:16:45,950 --> 01:16:47,530
I hate you.

1629
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,120
If you aren't nice to
me I'm going to smash the shit

1630
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,620
out of your curling iron.

1631
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:52,320
And I'm serious.

1632
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:54,790
Effing serious this time.

1633
01:17:05,400 --> 01:17:07,970
Cricket, cricket.

1634
01:17:07,970 --> 01:17:10,870
Never-mind that, I'm busy
again getting ready

1635
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,010
for the eleventh annual Leap 4
Your Life competition,

1636
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:19,020
and this year I have some crazy
talent in my senior company.

1637
01:17:19,020 --> 01:17:20,350
Max!

1638
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,050
Eyes forward.

1639
01:17:23,660 --> 01:17:25,290
They're gonna be fierce.

1640
01:17:25,290 --> 01:17:29,260
Oh yeah.

1641
01:17:29,260 --> 01:17:31,360
Five, six, seven, eight.
