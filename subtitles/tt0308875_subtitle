00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
<b>Shaheed-e-Mohabbat Boota Singh
(lit. Martyr-in-Love Boota Singh)</b>

2
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,200
"Martyr-in-Love Boota Singh"?

3
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,370
I didn't get it. A Sikh's tomb
in a Muslim graveyard?

4
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Yeah, a Sikh's tomb
in a Muslim graveyard.

5
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,170
Because who sacrifice themselves for love,
are beyond religions.

6
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,900
You're not talking straight.
I still didn't understand.

7
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,700
Dear friend, it seems
that you're not from around here.

8
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,370
Because if you were a Lahori,
you'd have never asked the question.

9
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,700
Boota Singh's anniversary
is being celebrated today.

10
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,800
Look, the whole Lahore
is here to pay respect. Look!

11
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,700
You're right.
I really don't know.

12
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,600
Who was Boota Singh?
And what noble he did...

13
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,200
..that Muslims,
who were killing Sikhs in 1947,

14
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,570
..paying respect to a Sikh, today?

15
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,000
You were talking about Lahoris?

16
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,000
The people who brutally killed the Sikhs
and set their houses on fire.

17
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,830
Boota Singh extinguished
that fire of hatred with love...

18
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,430
and filled their hearts with love only.

19
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,500
Let me know the story
of Boota Singh.

20
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,700
If he was a human
or an angel.

21
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:33,300
He was just a human
like you and I.

22
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,950
But what he did for his love...

23
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,430
would surely make angels salute him.

24
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,000
The story is old enough.

25
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,700
Many years before the independence,

26
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,400
when we were being ruled
by the Britishers.

27
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:59,900
Boota Singh was a soldier
from Jalandhar.

28
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:06,600
After fighting under the command
of Lord Mount Batten,

29
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:10,450
<i>..when Boota Singh returned back
to his village from the Burma front,</i>

30
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:14,500
<i>..all his age-mates were married,
having their own families.</i>

31
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,570
<i>Boota Singh's youth
was flying away.</i>

32
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,100
<i>But a hope
to have a family of his own...</i>

33
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,300
<i>..was still floating
in some corner of his heart.</i>

34
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,800
Recognize me?

35
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I'm Boota. Boota Singh!

36
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,000
You were of this (tiny) size
when I left the village.

37
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,270
But now you're taller than me!

38
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,800
No friends? Alone here?

39
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:22,000
I was at the front,
but why you're alone, huh?

40
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,900
What?

41
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,530
Yeah, I'm not so young, too.

42
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,500
Okay friend. Bye then.

43
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,970
We'll talk later sometime.

44
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,600
Hmm?

45
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,600
(Greetings) Let me touch
your feet , uncle!

46
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,570
Why are you staring like that, uncle?

47
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,450
I'm Boota. Not his ghost.

48
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,700
Thank God, you're back alive
from the front!

49
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,870
Couldn't be here
when my father died.

50
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,600
Don't be sad.
Come in. Come.

51
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,630
Hey, see who is here!
Come. Come in.

52
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:40,500
- Sat Sri Akaal!
- Don't you bow down before me...

53
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,900
..but the Guru Granth Sahib.

54
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,600
No, not more.

55
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,670
I know, you'll now go
to the temple and then the mosque.

56
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,200
The lovely thing is that
you don't visit the places to worship.

57
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:16,200
Don't know
what people think of you?

58
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,200
But a person like you
is always dear to the God.

59
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,700
Give me.

60
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Take it and go now.

61
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,400
Now, what's your plan
for the future, Boota?

62
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,000
Nothing, uncle.

63
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,300
Just farming.

64
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,100
And will get married,
full filling father's last wish...

65
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,600
that he expressed in every letter.

66
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:57,000
Son, the younger ones are unmarried.

67
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,700
<i>How could you
find a bride at this age?</i>

68
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I suggest recite Japji Sahib daily.
It'll be better for you.

69
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,400
Whatever God decides, uncle.

70
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,700
Let me see how is my home.

71
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,470
- Okay then, uncle.
- Okay.

72
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,070
- Bye, aunt.
- <i>Bye, Boota.</i>

73
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,730
- Bye, brother.
- Bye, bro.

74
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,900
He's gonna die unmarried.

75
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,700
His part of land
will be ours, son.

76
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:00,300
Mother.
Mother, I'm hungry, too.

77
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,300
Eat this hot Prauntha, son.

78
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,770
Here you go.

79
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,500
Oi, Boota, isn't your fast today?

80
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,130
O leave it ji,
my son is hungry, let him eat.

81
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:16,000
He is going to be a soldier.

82
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,800
He's not gonna be weak
if he miss a time.

83
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,730
Look, he'll not be fasting
until I'm here.

84
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:28,100
Who's gonna care
when I'm gone.

85
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,600
Who are you?

86
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,700
- Ramzani. And you?
- Boota Singh.

87
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,170
Where you came from?

88
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,400
- From the (Burma) front.
- Where will you go?

89
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,400
Nowhere.

90
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,400
The ones who come, don't go,
and those who've gone, don't come.

91
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,170
But I'm not either one of them.

92
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:22,600
I'll stay. It's my home.

93
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,100
- Home? It's your home?
- Hmm.

94
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,200
Yeah, brother, it's my home.

95
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,900
- But I have no home.
- Then where do you live?

96
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,830
In the village.
The whole village is my home.

97
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,830
Then, it means
you're the owner of the village.

98
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,830
You're the king
and we, your people.

99
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,100
You're my people?

100
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,200
Now, come...

101
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,770
- ..and help your people.
- Huh? What do I do?

102
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,470
- Help me cleaning the house.
- How?

103
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,600
- By sweeping.
- You got it!!

104
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,600
- Take it.
- Throw away, dude.

105
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:56,900
Hey, where are you going?

106
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,500
Bibi (Lady), give me
some water, please.

107
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,800
Boota Singh, you?

108
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,800
Santo?

109
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,500
Did your wife also come
or is there?

110
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,100
- I'm not married yet.
- Why?

111
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,200
I heard that Burmese girls
are very charming.

112
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,830
- But not for me.
- Really?

113
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,370
Why?

114
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:43,970
There was a girl...

115
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,430
..to whom I, once, promised
to get married to.

116
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,670
If you'd have gone
after we got married,

117
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,670
..I would still be waiting for you.

118
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,700
How long a (unmarried) girl can wait?

119
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,900
10 years? 20?

120
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:06,900
It's extremely hard
to fight with time, Boota.

121
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:12,900
No matter how hard you fight,
it finally defeats you.

122
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:20,400
Even Heer, Sassi and Sohni
were defeated...

123
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,500
then who am I?

124
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,500
- Boota.
- Hmm?

125
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,770
Today, you'd have been
the father of 3 children.

126
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,100
- Three?
- Yeah.

127
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm mother of 3 children.

128
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,300
- He is the eldest.
- Come here, boy.

129
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,230
- What is your name?
- Boota.

130
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,070
Boota.

131
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,500
Let's go home, mother.

132
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,200
Okay.

133
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:14,270
It's all about fate, Santo.

134
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,130
Some have good,
and some have bad.

135
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,100
Are you gonna stay or go back?

136
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:28,130
I'm done there, I think.

137
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,300
Okay.

138
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,900
- Are you home, soldier?
- Come, Shah ji, come in.

139
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:51,970
These works
doesn't suit you, soldier.

140
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,500
- They belongs to women.
- I know.

141
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,470
- But God didn't make one for me.
- No, no, no. Don't blame god.

142
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,800
- He sent me as a medium to you.
- So, you know some magic trick?

143
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,970
I frequently visit U.P. & Bihar
for business.

144
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,500
There is much poverty.

145
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,870
From there, I can manage
a beautiful wife for you.

146
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,500
But it'll cost some money.

147
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,900
- How much?
- Rupees 2000, nearly.

148
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,070
Two thousand.
But I have only 500.

149
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:22,400
No problem.
Borrow from your uncle?

150
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:24,700
He has a family to feed.

151
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,900
They have their own needs.

152
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,900
Find some other way then.

153
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,800
I have some productive land...

154
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:36,200
..that can save me,
nearly, 500 a year.

155
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,500
Meaning it'll take about 3 years.

156
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Okay call me
when you've managed.

157
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,700
I got to go now.

158
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,100
You'll be married, finally.

159
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,370
<i>After being assured by Vilayati Ram,</i>

160
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,000
<i>
Boota Singh's dying hope
was young again.</i>

161
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,800
<i>He started saving
every penny for that.</i>

162
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:17,400
<i>Poor Boota Singh worked hard 24/7
trying to save the maximum.</i>

163
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,000
<i>Time continue passing
by days, weeks and years.</i>

164
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:50,340
AUGUST, 1947
PARTITION OF INDIA

165
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,700
The train stopped in the jungle.

166
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,900
We sat breathless.

167
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:02,200
In some time, Muslims came
with their swords waving in the air.

168
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:07,700
And shouting "Allah Hoo",
they started killing everyone.

169
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,800
They killed my mother and son
before my eyes.

170
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,800
They took my daughter away.

171
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
There were dead bodies around me.

172
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:29,000
They left me for dead
to die every moment.

173
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,430
When the train arrived Jalandhar,

174
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:39,430
there were dead bodies all around.
Dead bodies all around

175
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,200
They killed our Sikh
and Hindu brothers...

176
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:53,000
..and Muslims here
are still living fearless.

177
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,100
It's not their fault.

178
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,500
Why take revenge from
the Muslims living here?

179
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:59,500
Why not?
Aren't they Muslims?

180
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,670
Then what?

181
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,300
They belong here,
not Arab.

182
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,670
They are one of us.
Our brothers, our friends.

183
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,070
It's our duty to protect them.

184
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,300
But what if our neighbor
villages attacked them?

185
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:14,600
Riots are everywhere.

186
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,200
In my opinion, they should
be taken to a safe place.

187
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:22,730
They'll be back when it's over.

188
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,430
Till then, we'll take care
of their houses etc..

189
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:29,100
Yeah, that's better.

190
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,900
So, Boota Singh,
it's your responsibility.

191
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,800
You're an experienced one.

192
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,100
Lambardar ji, I promise,

193
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,400
..they'll reach the camp
safe and sound.

194
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,100
I'll protect them
till my last breath.

195
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,300
- "Jo Bole So Nihaal...!!"
- "..Sat Sri Akaal!!!"

196
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,300
Okay, Boota Singh.
May god bless you.

197
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,200
Take these keys.

198
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,030
If we never come back...

199
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,730
- ..then everything is yours.
- What are you saying uncle.

200
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,700
You'll definitely be back.

201
00:28:57,770 --> 00:29:01,200
Water can't be cut
by a sword. Be positive.

202
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,100
Okay, Boota Singh.

203
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,400
May Allah bless you
with long life.

204
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,400
Let's go, brother!

205
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
MUSLIM REFUGEES
HEADED FOR PAKISTAN

206
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,530
<i>Mother!! Mother!</i>

207
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,900
- Father!! Help!!
- Help my daughter!!

208
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:02,000
- Help!!
- Father!!

209
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,100
You stay away!!

210
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,630
For Allah's sake, leave me!!

211
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,000
Hey! Catch her!!

212
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,470
Sardar ji, Help!!!

213
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,470
Hey, stop!

214
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:06,570
Let the girl go.
She is no match for you.

215
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,500
- Hey, give our prey back.
- What would you do with her?

216
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,900
First enjoy, then kill.

217
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,400
- We'll do the duty.
- To hell with such duty.

218
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:18,600
She came to me for help.
It's my duty to protect her.

219
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:19,930
She is a Muslim.

220
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,770
Then? Is this a fault
to born in a Muslim family?

221
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:26,900
What about the girls
born in the Sikh and Hindu families?

222
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:28,570
We'll do the same with her...

223
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,750
what Muslims do with ours.
We'll avenge.

224
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,330
Is that what you've learned
from the Guru Granth Sahib?

225
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,800
Don't exhort us, soldier.

226
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,100
People locked the Geeta, Quran
and Guru Granth Sahib, nowadays.

227
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,730
Be clear if you're charmed
by her beauty.

228
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,570
- Shame on your joke.
- <i>Not a joke, soldier.</i>

229
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,470
You're unmarried and so are we.

230
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:51,670
If you wanna keep her, you have to pay for it.

231
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,600
Pay?

232
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:56,970
Boota Singh, we got her very hard,
rupees 2500 is a fair price, I think.

233
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,200
- And what if I refuse to.
- Then you'll witness her being raped!

234
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,600
- Hey, take her!
- Not a step forward!

235
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,600
You both will be killed, soldier.

236
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,800
- Don't make us your enemy.
- Accept the deal, soldier.

237
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,100
<i>They've gone crazy, Boota.</i>

238
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,400
<i>You may not save her
even at your life.</i>

239
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,700
<i>It's better to pay them
and keep the humanity alive.</i>

240
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,300
What are you thinking?

241
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,800
- How much do you want?
- Told you, rupees 2500.

242
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:31,400
But I have 1800 only.

243
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:35,670
Not enough
according to her beauty.

244
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,100
Well, I'm very kind.

245
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:42,100
You won't get
a second chance to get her.

246
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,930
<i>But accepted!
We'll find another one.</i>

247
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,600
I think there is no need to count.

248
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,500
Go enjoy then.

249
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:01,600
The girl is all yours from now.

250
00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:03,970
Let's go enjoy as well.

251
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,500
The meal is ready, take it.

252
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,850
I'm gonna lock the door from outside,

253
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:15,600
so that no one enters
in my absence.

254
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,300
I'm leaving.
Any question?

255
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:29,300
I was after him.

256
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,700
I warned him that I'll kill him
within 200 yard.

257
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,000
He is tired.

258
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:43,600
I move my sword in the air
and his head was on the ground.

259
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,000
I've done my duty 99 times.

260
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,500
One more,
and I'll consider it a pilgrimage.

261
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:59,000
Few days back, we attacked
a train heading for Lahore.

262
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,700
At the end,
we found a Brahmin there.

263
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:05,900
Just before getting off,
I thought of teasing him.

264
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,800
I said, "O Brahmin,
are you going to Pakistan?"

265
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:17,070
He said, "No, say Allah,
why I'd go to Pakistan?"

266
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:21,000
And we killed him at once.

267
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:24,200
Give me one more bottle.

268
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,300
Hey, soldier.

269
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,100
Why you're here?

270
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:38,970
Swarna told me..

271
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,500
- ..that he deliver you a wine-like girl.
- What rubbish are you talking?

272
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:46,100
That Muslim girl!

273
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:51,100
Whose eyes
are glasses of wine themselves.

274
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:55,700
Whose every gentle move
is intoxicating.

275
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,600
Keep enjoying.

276
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:02,700
Keep enjoying
the endless wine of beauty.

277
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,200
Hey!

278
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:08,600
Hey, guys, not here.
Do what you want but outside.

279
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,500
You so of a...

280
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,130
- Hey, not here.
- You son of a... I'll kill you.

281
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:18,970
Get off! I'll kill this... bastard!

282
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,500
♪ Hey, get up, it's morning! ♪

283
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,570
♪ Night is no more to be asleep! ♪

284
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,500
♪ Night is no more to be asleep! ♪

285
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,400
Forgive me friend, Ramzani.

286
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,900
Last night, I was here, in your kingdom,
without your permission.

287
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,500
You didn't do good last night.

288
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,800
Me?

289
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:56,830
- What did I do?
- You fought while drunk.

290
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,600
In my kingdom?

291
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,800
Please, forgive me, o King.
My fault.

292
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,800
Please, o king of the world!

293
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,000
- It'll not be repeated.
- Okay. Forgiven.

294
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,500
Take this twig.

295
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,970
- It's of Neem.
- Really?

296
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,600
- Hmm.
- Okay, then.

297
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,500
- Who's there?
- Boota Singh.

298
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:40,100
- Boota Singh, who?
- The owner of the house.

299
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,000
Where was the owner last night?

300
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,300
Where I wished.

301
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,400
O <i>Waheguru Akaal Purakh</i>
bless me!

302
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:18,700
The owner slept out
and the outsiders in,

303
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,700
..is this the tradition of the village?

304
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:24,700
You're not going to be here for life
to worry about the tradition.

305
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,270
O Allah!
What are you doing?

306
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:30,500
I thought someone might be hungry.

307
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,700
At least I am.

308
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,600
I'm going to make <i>Rotis.</i>

309
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,800
- It doesn't suit men.
- Really?

310
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,800
No one told me before.

311
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,300
Because there is no women here.

312
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:51,200
But you don't belong
to the women. You're a guest.

313
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,400
Then what?
I'm still a woman.

314
00:38:56,230 --> 00:39:02,800
Guests stay for a while,
and finally, go away.

315
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,800
Then again, the same Boota Singh,
the same women works.

316
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,200
Come on, move.

317
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,500
Everyone is a guest on Earth
and is not forever.

318
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:16,900
You and I are such guests.
It's all about time.

319
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,000
You cook very well.

320
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:29,600
My mother says...

321
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,100
..the work you enjoy doing,
always end up good.

322
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:35,800
Tell me about yourself.

323
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,600
Name is Zainab.
Belong to Rajasthan.

324
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:47,900
Faced the same
what many others did.

325
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:53,500
Now you will decide what's next.

326
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,300
God will decide, not me.

327
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,300
As soon as everything is normal,
I'll take you to your parents.

328
00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:02,700
Till then,
you are my responsibility.

329
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:07,500
Sardar ji, until I'm here..

330
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,900
..you're not doing any home-work.

331
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,500
Okay, as you wish.

332
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,800
I'm leaving for the farms.

333
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,400
I'll be there with the lunch.

334
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:23,350
<font color="yellow"><b>www.fb.com/shaheed.mohabbat.bs</b></font>

335
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,400
- <i>Oi, Boota Singh!
- </i>Coming, Shah ji!

336
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:44,100
- Sat Sri Akaal, Shah ji!
- Sat Sri Akaal, Boota. Sit.

337
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,170
Tomorrow I'm going to U.P.

338
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,900
I'll bring a woman
and you'll be married!

339
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:55,770
Shah ji, it seems there is no line
of marriage in my hands.

340
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,700
What do you mean?

341
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,600
You're saving money for your marriage
for the last three years!

342
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:02,800
<i>- Yeah, right, I do.
- That's it, then!</i>

343
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,370
By God, Boota, I'm not
even charging you my fee.

344
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,100
All the money will go
to the girl's poor family.

345
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:12,200
- But, Shah ji, the money is gone.
- Gone?

346
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,900
<i> Where? Did you gamble?</i>

347
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,200
You know I don't gamble.

348
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:22,000
Few days back, some youngsters
were chasing a Muslim girl.

349
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,300
<i>They wanted to kill her.</i>

350
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,250
Just paid for her life.

351
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:30,600
And you spent your life savings
to rescue a Muslim girl, Boota?

352
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
<i>Who is she to you, you fool?</i>

353
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Now, what you gonna
do with her?

354
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,970
As the riots over, I'll take her
to her family in Pakistan.

355
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,470
You gonna die unmarried, fool!

356
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:43,400
Even having nobody
to perform your last rituals.

357
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:45,600
Can I suggest you something?

358
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,470
Marry the girl.

359
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:52,800
Shah ji, you think humans
are subject to buy and sell?

360
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:58,870
Neither Boota Singh
did that trade before nor will.

361
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,050
Go to hell, then.

362
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,900
What if you got sick,
nobody will take care of you.

363
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:07,400
- Your rivals wouldn't even offer.
- No problem. May God bless me.

364
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,800
"<i>May God bless me."</i>

365
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,700
<i>Where are you going?</i>

366
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,800
Going to sleep, outside.

367
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:18,170
Whose house is this?

368
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,100
Mine.

369
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,530
And who am I?

370
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:28,200
An outsider in your refuge,
not the owner of the house.

371
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,900
From today, you'll sleep on the bed,
and me, on the ground.

372
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,400
Don't you... fear of me?

373
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,000
No, I don't.

374
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,200
Should I?

375
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:45,500
No.. I didn't mean that, Zainab.

376
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,800
- People will consider it bad.
- What do you mean "will"?

377
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:51,800
They might have started already.

378
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,800
Whatever they do, I don't care.

379
00:42:55,630 --> 00:43:00,300
- But Zainab you...
- Quiet! It's been decided.

380
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,970
- Sat Sri Akaal, Shah ji!
- Sat Sri Akaal! Sat Sri Akaal!

381
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,500
Then, what brought you here,
Boota Singh?

382
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:25,570
- Just need some suits, Shah ji.
- Suits?

383
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,670
Oi, Boota Singh, this shop
doesn't have suits for you.

384
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,300
I sell ladies' suits only. Yeah!

385
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,900
- Actually, I need ladies' suits.
- Really?

386
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,600
Oi, Boota Singh, shame on you.

387
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:43,470
Well, what I've to do with it!

388
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:46,100
- What are the measurements?
- Measurements?

389
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,400
I don't.. know that.

390
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,770
Then go and get her
measurements or ask her.

391
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,100
Okay, wait.

392
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,400
- Get her along, here.
- Here?

393
00:43:58,230 --> 00:44:00,200
No... I can't do this.

394
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,400
Really?

395
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,100
- What's the age?
- Age...

396
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,600
- Age... 16 or 17, I guess.
- 16 or 17?

397
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:11,170
Shame on you, Boota Singh.

398
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,000
Well, why am I worrying!

399
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,000
Okay, how tall is she?

400
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:17,400
<i>Heavy or skinny?</i>

401
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,470
- Just like her.
- Like her?

402
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,500
Have you gone mad, Boota?

403
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:28,700
Well, what I've to do with it!
I'm just a seller. Here you go.

404
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,570
What's that?

405
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:42,370
- It's just some suits for you.
- For me?

406
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:49,170
From where you got
my measurements?

407
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,500
I see you daily.

408
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,700
Really?

409
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,470
Sardar ji, are they your eyes
or the measuring tapes...

410
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,800
that measure women's bodies?

411
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:03,570
Didn't anyone, ever, slap you?

412
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,000
You're talking about the world's women,
I just meant you!

413
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:08,270
Really?

414
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:12,200
- The seller replace if it's a mismatch?
- He said so.

415
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:15,300
Wait, I'm gonna show you.

416
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:23,030
Sardar ji, your eyes
are just amazing,

417
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:24,700
guessed my size absolutely right!

418
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,400
Tell me, how do I...

419
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,100
Strange man.

420
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:34,600
At least should see,
how do I look.

421
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:24,900
You almost killed me!

422
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,600
- Who're you?
- Ramzani.

423
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,200
Ramzani? Ramzani, who?

424
00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:33,100
This village is mine.
Who're you?

425
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,570
I'm Zainab.

426
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,500
- Assalaam-o-Aalaikum!
- Walaikum Assalaam!

427
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:42,500
You're very beautiful!
And I'm hungry.

428
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,900
Come, have the meal.

429
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:49,100
- Sat Sri Akaal, uncle!
- <i>Sat Sri Akaal!</i>

430
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:50,500
Lets have some tea or something.

431
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:53,650
- <i>Later sometime, I'm in a hurry, now.
</i>- Wait a minute, uncle, who is that...

432
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,800
..teenager girl at Boota's home?

433
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,370
A teenager girl?

434
00:46:59,430 --> 00:47:01,470
At Boota Singh's home?
Who told you?

435
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,300
He bought six suits for her from me.

436
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,700
- Did he pay in cash?
- No. He'll pay after the harvest.

437
00:47:08,830 --> 00:47:10,900
Well, why I'm worrying.

438
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:13,150
He owns 3 acres of land.

439
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,370
<i>I shouldn't be worried
about my payment.</i>

440
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,230
Well, I shouldn't care...

441
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:24,000
..if he buy for a teenager
or a 35-years-old. I'm just a seller.

442
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:29,900
Tea.

443
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:38,300
Boota, this girl just changed
the look of your house.

444
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:43,400
But be careful, these people
can't be trusted.

445
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:48,500
Uncle, what precious I have
for her to run away with?

446
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,600
Boota, you're (cousin) sister's
gonna get married.

447
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:52,600
Hmm-hmm!

448
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,400
She is, actually,
like a daughter to you.

449
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:01,100
- Is the guy well settled?
- Doing government job, earns much.

450
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,100
Then Raj Rani gonna be a queen.

451
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:04,600
Boota,

452
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,300
..your mother bought
a necklace for your wife.

453
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,700
- Chhajju jeweler told me!
- Yeah, that's right.

454
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:19,200
You still hope for a family
or not?

455
00:48:21,330 --> 00:48:24,300
Just the death rituals
is the next, uncle.

456
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:27,400
Don't say bad words,
you mad. I'm here for you.

457
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,600
- Do you still have that necklace?
- <i>Yes!</i>

458
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,900
Keeping the mother's
keepsake with great care.

459
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:37,700
I'm asking if you can gift it
at Raj Rani's wedding...

460
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:39,900
That's much better, uncle.

461
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,600
Gonna get it for you.

462
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,400
- Uncle?
- Yes?

463
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:06,000
Couldn't find it.

464
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,900
- I forget where I placed it.
- Telling the truth?

465
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,500
Tell me, if you don't
wanna give it to me.

466
00:49:13,530 --> 00:49:16,300
What're you saying, uncle?
I'm not lying to you.

467
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:18,100
Well, it's not a hurry.

468
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,000
Take it to me when found, uh?
I Gotta go.

469
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,570
What happened?
Is the food not tasty?

470
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,100
No, that's not the case, Zainab.

471
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:39,700
I'm not just hungry.

472
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:42,600
Let me know, why?

473
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,930
That necklace was
the last keepsake of my mother.

474
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,600
It made me feel
that mother was still here.

475
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:55,700
Now, I feel,
like, I lost her forever.

476
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,000
Like she is angry.

477
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:06,000
If you love it that much,
then keep it with greater care.

478
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,800
You had it?

479
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:14,700
If I didn't, you'd have lost it to him.

480
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:18,000
Uncle and Raj Rani
are not strangers but my own blood.

481
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,000
Your "own blood" never even
offer you a glass of water.

482
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,800
You even used to
cook food yourself, before me.

483
00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:28,000
What are you saying, Zainab?

484
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:32,770
They're waiting for you to die,
so they can capture your part of land.

485
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,200
I never thought about that.

486
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:39,200
You'd have made to think
if there were a woman here.

487
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,200
Take the meal.

488
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:53,700
Zainab, today you're here,
tomorrow you may not.

489
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:56,500
Who'll teach me
these things, then?

490
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,700
Tomorrow is uncertain, Sardar ji.

491
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,700
We decide when it comes.

492
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:12,000
It's Zainab's fate
to be in this village...

493
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,900
that's why she was saved
by Boota Singh.

494
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,270
Boota have gone mad.

495
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:19,650
I think he's planning to marry her.

496
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:21,600
What? What're you saying?

497
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,600
I've seen this in his eyes.

498
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:25,400
My daughter is
going to get married.

499
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,130
If her in-laws comes to know...

500
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,630
..that her cousin has a Muslim wife,

501
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,300
they will break the relationship.

502
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:34,800
You don't worry,
I'll call the Panchayat meet tonight.

503
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,200
<i>Boota Singh.</i>

504
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:42,100
When the whole Panjab
was captured by the riots,

505
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:44,500
..our village had peace.

506
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:50,600
You protected
the Muslim population.

507
00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:53,300
But now I heard...

508
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:56,400
..that you bought a Muslim girl,

509
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:58,800
..who is at your home right now.

510
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:02,300
Tell people the truth?

511
00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:04,800
The truth is
that I didn't buy the girl...

512
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:07,000
but paid for her life.

513
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:10,600
Let everything be normal,
I'll take her to her parents.

514
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:14,500
If you can take the whole
Muslim population safely,

515
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:17,200
..then what's the problem
with one girl?

516
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,900
<i>Tell us if you need any help.</i>

517
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:21,600
If the Panchayat's ordering me...

518
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,900
..to drive Zainab to the camp,
then I'll follow that.

519
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:30,800
Zainab?

520
00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:34,700
- How long it'll take you?
- <i>Just coming!</i>

521
00:52:35,430 --> 00:52:38,000
Sat Sri Akaal! I'll come, too.
I didn't see a city yet.

522
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,700
Okay, come along.

523
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,500
Ready?

524
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:44,100
Zainab, you didn't ask
why we're going to the city?

525
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:46,530
Sardar ji, I trust you.

526
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,400
If you ask me to jump into a well,
I'd jump blindly.

527
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,870
It's not good to trust too much
in a human being, Zainab.

528
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:36,800
Here we go.

529
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:41,100
- We've arrived.
- What's this place?

530
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,600
This is a camp for refugees
bond for Pakistan.

531
00:53:45,370 --> 00:53:46,400
Then?

532
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,000
There is this guy, Aslam.

533
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,800
Very nice guy.

534
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:54,600
Your age-mate as well.
I've talked to him.

535
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,900
He'll marry you
and take you to Pakistan,

536
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,200
..and, so, to your parents.

537
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:12,000
I present... this necklace...
as your wedding gift.

538
00:54:14,130 --> 00:54:15,500
Gift?

539
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:17,800
<i>Keep your gift for your rivals.</i>

540
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:21,200
Who are you to fix my wedding
with a stranger?

541
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:26,400
You decided my life
for feeding me two <i>Rotis?</i>

542
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:29,300
Who gave you the right?

543
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,700
Zainab,

544
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:32,870
do I not have the right
to do something nice to you?

545
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,970
You protected me.

546
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:37,000
Been my savior.

547
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,500
And today, my savior
is handing me to a stranger?

548
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,000
Why?

549
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,600
Because I'm a Muslim?

550
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:53,600
Sardar Boota Singh,
go back to your hell.

551
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,000
And I'll endure
what happens to me.

552
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,200
Ramzani, tell me
what do I do, man?

553
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,000
Go to your hell
taking her along.

554
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:15,500
Boota Singh,
we understand your helplessness.

555
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,530
But you understand ours.

556
00:55:17,570 --> 00:55:20,070
We all have sisters and daughters.

557
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:23,800
Zainab can't live with you
without getting married to you.

558
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:27,500
Now, tell me,
do you agree to marry her?

559
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:31,200
My agreement or disagreement
is out of question.

560
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:33,500
Actually, the question is...

561
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,800
why would Zainab marry
a man like me?

562
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:39,600
- You ask her.
- No, sir. I can't do this.

563
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:43,300
Okay, no problem.
We'll ask her.

564
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:47,200
But if she agrees,
then you have to marry her.

565
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,700
<i>Zainab, answer with a "yes" or "no".</i>

566
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:53,600
Do you agree
to get married to Boota?

567
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,700
Yes. I do.

568
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:07,500
Would you like some sweet?

569
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:11,700
Live long, my daughter!

570
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:20,200
Hurry up! I'm hungry!

571
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,900
Come, come, come!

572
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:38,070
Father, you said
Boota would die unmarried,

573
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,200
..his part of land will be ours.
But he's got married.

574
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,400
- Just married, he's not a father yet.
- It doesn't need much time.

575
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:49,300
It needs, son.
Be patient, take the meal.

576
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:53,750
Till yesterday,
she was like a scared deer.

577
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:58,300
But looking stunning
in the wedding dress, today.

578
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:04,800
Lets go girls,
she doesn't want us here.

579
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:11,350
Boota, the first night is important
otherwise the wife become the head.

580
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:14,850
Boota, we've prayed so long
for this day.

581
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:18,870
Why making her wait longer.

582
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:22,430
You drunkards, go home. Go.

583
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,400
Just leaving, Kuldeep Kaur,

584
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,070
- why getting angry?
- Come, Ramzani, have the meal.

585
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,500
- Lets go, tailor, we're no longer needed.
- Come on, Boota. Get up.

586
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:31,870
- It starts now.
- Come, come.

587
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,150
- Get in.
- Come.

588
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:35,770
Leave, girls. Go home.

589
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,070
- Hey, you...?
- I'm hungry.

590
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:39,700
O Allah!!

591
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:41,600
Sardar ji, be careful.

592
00:57:41,970 --> 00:57:45,400
You got me, I'm safe.

593
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,700
Now, tell me, who are you?

594
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:50,300
Who am I?

595
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:52,100
I'm your wife.

596
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:55,200
Every night,
same dream in the hangover.

597
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,600
I ask, "who are you?"

598
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,100
She says, "I'm your wife."

599
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:04,400
In the morning, wine gets off,
wife disappears,

600
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,800
..and Boota is alone again.

601
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:10,900
I'm Zainab.

602
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,800
Not wine, that gets off.

603
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Zainab.

604
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,800
What about dreams you had?

605
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:23,970
Who gets everything in real...

606
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,100
why would she dream.

607
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,770
It's like a <i>Fakir</i> found a diamond,

608
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:33,500
afraid of losing it.

609
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:36,150
The God united us.

610
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:38,300
Is there any power beyond Him?

611
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,100
The country partitioned,
the caravan was attacked,

612
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:49,000
..I ran, you saved, lived in this house,

613
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,100
..that was all my fate, wasn't it?

614
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,500
Zainab.

615
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:00,600
I don't even know
how to talk to women.

616
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:02,300
Really?

617
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,800
Let me teach you...

618
00:59:08,270 --> 00:59:11,500
..how to talk to women.

619
01:04:30,850 --> 01:04:35,850
<font color="yellow"><b>www.fb.com/shaheed.mohabbat.bs</b></font>

620
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:40,860
<font color="yellow"><b>www.fb.com/shaheed.mohabbat.bs</b></font>

621
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,870
<font color="yellow"><b>www.fb.com/shaheed.mohabbat.bs</b></font>

622
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,400
..blessed me with a wise wife, Zainab,

623
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,800
..and a daughter.

624
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:07,300
O my True Lord,
you gave me everything.

625
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:10,600
Is this really my fate?

626
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:13,900
Every inch of mine is in your debt.

627
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:17,200
Keep my family
under your protection...

628
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,000
under your protection, my Lord.

629
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,370
We're made homeless
by these Muslims,

630
01:05:54,430 --> 01:05:58,100
..and this infidel is still free,
defiling our temple?

631
01:06:02,270 --> 01:06:03,770
Hey, Ramzani.

632
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,000
Come with us we'll give you <i>Kheer.</i>

633
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:08,900
- <i>Kheer</i>?
- Yeah! And sweets, too.

634
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,900
Yeah, come on!

635
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,300
- Come. Come.
- Where are the sweets?

636
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:16,170
- What's a hurry? Be patient!
- Okay, hurry up.

637
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,050
Hey, take his head off!!

638
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,370
Shame on your
for killing this innocent?

639
01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:26,800
Is that your bravery?

640
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,800
- He's a Muslim.
- Muslim?

641
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:32,630
He's not a Hindu, Muslim or Sikh,
he is just a human, a villager.

642
01:07:32,650 --> 01:07:34,200
He's the spirit of the village!

643
01:07:34,270 --> 01:07:36,200
His murder
is the murder of humanity.

644
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:39,370
- Come, Ramzani!
- No, they gonna give me sweets!

645
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:44,170
- I've made all this and the carrot dish, too.
- Carrot dish!? Then okay, lets go.

646
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,650
Come on. Carrot dish, um-mm!

647
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,800
- Ramzani!!
- May God have His curse on you!

648
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,500
You've killed an innocent.

649
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:42,300
Ramzani?

650
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:44,900
Ramzani!

651
01:08:47,700 --> 01:08:48,930
Ramzani!

652
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,600
The carrot dish!!

653
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,500
<i>Kheer!!</i> I want Khee...

654
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,300
Oi, Ramzani!!

655
01:09:49,370 --> 01:09:52,800
- Sardar ji!
- My friend, Ramzani!

656
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,130
- O God!!
- Sardar ji!

657
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:57,900
Zainab, my friend
Ramzani is no more,.

658
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,550
<i>According to a new agreement
between India and Pakistan,</i>

659
01:10:03,570 --> 01:10:09,770
<i>the Hindu and Sikh girls left in Pakistan
and Muslim girls left in India...</i>

660
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,900
<i>are to be deported
and sent back to their families.</i>

661
01:10:12,930 --> 01:10:15,770
<i>If there is any such girl
in your city or village...</i>

662
01:10:15,800 --> 01:10:18,900
<i>then inform
your nearest police station.</i>

663
01:10:19,030 --> 01:10:22,000
<i>Now, listen to a song
by Shamshad Begum.</i>

664
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:28,070
What's the hurry?
Wait till it's morning.

665
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,870
Tomorrow is uncertain.

666
01:10:29,900 --> 01:10:34,200
Until Zainab is here,
in this village, I'm restless.

667
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:38,500
Now, they've a daughter
but with a boy next, Boota's heir is born.

668
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:41,500
I'm leaving. What is good
should be done right away.

669
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:48,200
My little doll is very wise.

670
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,900
Meal for your way.

671
01:10:51,030 --> 01:10:54,300
- Okay, what to buy for you?
- Already gonna buy a cart.

672
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,500
Yeah, but cart belongs
to the whole family.

673
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:01,400
- I meant, for you specially.
- Sardar ji, buy a new blanket for you.

674
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,470
That one is too old.

675
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,230
Women taunt me saying
that I remain adorned,

676
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:09,500
..but the husband chills in that old blanket.
- Okay, okay!

677
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,400
I know what to buy for you.

678
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,800
Crazy!

679
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:30,200
Boota Singh, for what
you need money this time?

680
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:33,270
Wanna buy a new cart, Shah ji.

681
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:35,430
From the city,
I always go home late.

682
01:11:35,470 --> 01:11:38,800
Zainab and Guddi
wait, by themselves.

683
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,200
You've become extravagant,
Boota Singh!

684
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:46,800
You must save money
for bad times.

685
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,530
Bad time has passed, Shah ji!

686
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:52,070
God blessed with just happiness.

687
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,100
- Okay, bye, Shah ji!
- Bye.

688
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:07,300
- You must be Zainab.
- Yes, sir.

689
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:10,600
We've orders to get you
and deport to Pakistan.

690
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:12,400
Pakistan?

691
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:17,200
But I'm married, sir.
My everything is here.

692
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,300
What would I do in Pakistan?

693
01:12:19,330 --> 01:12:23,330
We've orders for all Muslim women,
you have to come.

694
01:12:23,370 --> 01:12:25,150
My husband is not home now.

695
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:27,500
- At least wait for him!
- Order is order!

696
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:30,000
He is not home now!

697
01:12:30,070 --> 01:12:31,700
<i>I don't wanna come!!</i>

698
01:12:32,330 --> 01:12:34,370
- My Guddi is here!!
- Get her.

699
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:36,100
My child!!

700
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:39,000
- For Allah's sake...!!
- No!

701
01:12:42,030 --> 01:12:46,270
- Shut up and come.
- Uncle, tell them I'm married!

702
01:12:46,470 --> 01:12:48,900
I'm willingly married!

703
01:12:49,930 --> 01:12:52,900
What's this?
O, please, stop them.

704
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:56,970
I don't wanna go!!
Get off of me!!

705
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,470
My Guddi is here!!

706
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,370
Sardar ji??
Somebody, please, help!!

707
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,000
I don't wanna go!!

708
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,000
Our new cart is here, Zainab!

709
01:19:20,200 --> 01:19:21,730
Where are you?

710
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:25,250
See what I have for...

711
01:19:31,670 --> 01:19:33,200
Where is my Zainab?

712
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:37,200
What happened to her?
Why you're quiet, aunt.

713
01:19:37,530 --> 01:19:39,300
Bhai ji? Pandit ji?

714
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:43,570
- Police took him, Boota.
- Police?

715
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,400
- Yes.
- What crime did she commit?

716
01:19:46,430 --> 01:19:49,800
<i>She is a Muslim</i>
so, will be sent to Pakistan.

717
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:52,430
- You kept her illegally.
- Illegally?

718
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:54,600
She did willingly marry me.

719
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:57,900
- The whole village witnessed.
- Yes, we all did.

720
01:19:57,970 --> 01:20:00,400
Bhai ji, you are the one
who performed the rituals.

721
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:02,400
Zainab is the mother of my child.

722
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:09,000
And no law a to separate a mother
from her newly born child.

723
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,800
Don't cry, my child!

724
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:14,300
I'll bring your mother back.
Lets go.

725
01:20:19,130 --> 01:20:22,200
- What was the name, again?
- Zainab, sir. From Nakodar.

726
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:28,800
- She was brought here.
- Can I talk to her, meet her?

727
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:34,700
No. She is sent to Purana Qila Camp
in Delhi, along with other women.

728
01:21:16,070 --> 01:21:17,570
Sardar ji?

729
01:21:17,700 --> 01:21:19,600
Sardar ji!!

730
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:21,800
Zainab? Zainab!!

731
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:24,270
Zainab!!

732
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:27,400
Sardar ji!
Sardar ji, I'm here!!

733
01:21:27,670 --> 01:21:28,900
Guddi!!

734
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:46,600
- Are you okay, Zainab?
- Just like a fish without water, Sardar ji.

735
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,400
Until they locate our families,

736
01:21:50,430 --> 01:21:52,500
..we'll be kept
here in this camp.

737
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:55,600
But I don't wanna go, Sardar ji!

738
01:21:56,700 --> 01:22:00,300
I'll die without you
and my daughter.

739
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,000
Find some way.

740
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:05,300
Take me home, Sardar ji.

741
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:08,000
No, Zainab, don't cry.

742
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:09,400
Be positive.

743
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:13,200
We, now, have our own administration;
our our government.

744
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:15,900
I'll request to the Prime Minister.

745
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,200
She'll definitely listen to me.

746
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:23,500
I believe, Zainab, I'll be here
with the good news, tomorrow.

747
01:22:31,330 --> 01:22:32,770
Look, Rani Sahiba is here.

748
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:36,300
Ms. Prime Minister?

749
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:39,270
Listen to me, Rani Sahiba!

750
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:43,400
Get me my Zainab,
my child's mother, back, Rani Sahiba.

751
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:46,400
- Make your request at the office.
- Get out!

752
01:25:49,630 --> 01:25:52,600
Guddi starts crying seeing you.

753
01:25:53,330 --> 01:25:54,800
Fell asleep, I think.

754
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,700
Sardar ji,
about a month has passed.

755
01:26:00,970 --> 01:26:03,600
But your efforts didn't turn
into some good news, yet.

756
01:26:05,700 --> 01:26:08,100
My hopes are dying.

757
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:13,100
Zainab, I visited both the places,
government's as well as God's.

758
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,800
None of them listen to me,

759
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:21,000
neither God, nor His people.

760
01:26:21,030 --> 01:26:23,000
Listen to me carefully.

761
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:26,200
They succeeded.

762
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:31,400
My parents live in
Barki village, near Lahore.

763
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:34,600
<i>Tomorrow, they'll take me there.</i>

764
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,200
You promise me,

765
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:41,300
..you'll come to take me home.

766
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,900
I can't live without you, Zainab.

767
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:47,600
The village is a cemetery
without you.

768
01:26:47,930 --> 01:26:49,300
I'll surely come.

769
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:51,400
Take care of Guddi.

770
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:55,900
But who'd take care of you?

771
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,700
You're a child as well.

772
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:07,700
Go, my daughter.

773
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:11,200
May God bless you!

774
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:27,300
Sister, Seeta.

775
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:32,000
You're, now,
going to your family in India.

776
01:27:32,330 --> 01:27:36,200
Don't forget
you've a brother in Pakistan.

777
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:40,700
Keep posting how you're.

778
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:44,670
Brother, Muhammad,
you risked your life for mine.

779
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:49,130
Even made enemies to save me.

780
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:53,100
Forgetting you
is like forgetting God.

781
01:27:54,400 --> 01:27:56,200
Keep this.

782
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:58,200
Be happy.

783
01:28:13,300 --> 01:28:14,500
Come.

784
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:36,800
- Who?
- Open the door.

785
01:28:36,830 --> 01:28:38,600
Your daughter is here.

786
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:42,700
Daughter?

787
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:45,900
My daughter?
But she is dead.

788
01:28:45,930 --> 01:28:48,000
She is alive
and standing next to me.

789
01:28:48,070 --> 01:28:51,700
She was killed in the riots
before my eyes.

790
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:53,500
I'm Zainab, father.

791
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:57,400
- <i>Don't you recognize my voice?</i>
- Nonsense. Who are you?

792
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,100
- And what is this spectacle?
- What happened to you, father?

793
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:04,470
You couldn't sleep
without hearing my voice.

794
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:06,500
Go. Get lost!

795
01:29:06,530 --> 01:29:09,600
No. It's Zainab.
Open the door.

796
01:29:09,930 --> 01:29:11,970
How we'd face the community?

797
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,470
She spent all those years among infidels
she is defiled.

798
01:29:15,500 --> 01:29:18,600
- No! No, no!
- Why don't you understand?

799
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:20,900
I'm your daughter, Zainab, mother.

800
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:25,800
- Do my tears have no effect on you?
- Let go off of me!

801
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:28,300
Let me see you once, mother.

802
01:29:28,970 --> 01:29:32,400
I'll go back. Really!

803
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:35,130
I'm not here to stay, mother.

804
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:38,530
- Open the door, mother.
- Get off of me!

805
01:29:39,470 --> 01:29:41,700
Come, my child!!

806
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:44,600
- Mother!
- Zainab!

807
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:49,000
Where have you been, my child?

808
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:53,700
O mother!

809
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:59,200
Think again, Boota.

810
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:02,000
Land/houses shouldn't be sold.

811
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:04,400
Land is mother.

812
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:06,600
My mother is dead.

813
01:30:07,030 --> 01:30:10,000
From where would you get to eat?
And where would you live?

814
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:15,100
I'm done with this village,
Lamardar.

815
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,200
I'll go to my Zainab.

816
01:30:18,770 --> 01:30:20,300
Okay, Boota.

817
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,900
As you wish.

818
01:30:24,030 --> 01:30:25,300
Here you go.

819
01:30:38,670 --> 01:30:40,200
Lets go my child!

820
01:36:38,700 --> 01:36:40,300
Drink, drink, drink!

821
01:36:49,100 --> 01:36:50,800
Which way to village Barki?

822
01:36:51,330 --> 01:36:55,300
Go straight and take right
on the next intersection.

823
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:21,400
- A glass of milk, please.
- Sure!

824
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:27,800
Here you go, sir!

825
01:37:28,200 --> 01:37:29,400
How much?

826
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:32,800
No charges for you, sir.
You're our guest!

827
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,230
Me? Guest?

828
01:37:34,670 --> 01:37:38,300
- Are you not from the groom's side?
- Groom? Whose is getting married?

829
01:37:38,370 --> 01:37:39,300
Zainab.

830
01:37:39,330 --> 01:37:41,300
<i>Returned from India few days back.</i>

831
01:37:42,870 --> 01:37:45,700
Lets go, dear,
something terrible is going on.

832
01:37:51,170 --> 01:37:54,730
- Qazi Sahib, perform the rituals.
- Yeah. Go on.

833
01:37:54,750 --> 01:37:56,000
Okay, sir.

834
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:59,270
Qazi Sahib! Qazi Sahib,
you can't remarry her.

835
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,800
- <i>For God's sake...
- </i>Sardar ji?

836
01:38:01,930 --> 01:38:04,100
- <i>don't do this!
- </i>My husband is here!!

837
01:38:04,130 --> 01:38:08,100
She is married to me
and is the mother of this child.

838
01:38:08,130 --> 01:38:12,970
How dare this infidel talking
this rubbish standing at my home.

839
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:15,430
<i>Today I'll teach you a lesson,</i>

840
01:38:15,470 --> 01:38:19,470
..<i>that you'd never forget.
Get lost!</i>

841
01:38:19,500 --> 01:38:21,570
- Listen to me!
- Hey, take the child. Get lost!

842
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,700
- Hey, what are you waiting...
- Sardar ji!!

843
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,200
Get off of me!!

844
01:38:27,230 --> 01:38:29,370
- Qazi Sahib!! Qazi Sahib!
- Hey, give me a stick.

845
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,800
- Don't be the wrongdoer, Qazi Sahib!
- I'm here, Sardar ji!

846
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:35,100
- What're you waiting for, beat him!
- Ask my Zainab!

847
01:38:36,130 --> 01:38:38,400
For Quran's sake, Qazi Sahib.

848
01:38:38,430 --> 01:38:41,270
- For God's sake, listen to me!
- Sardar ji!!

849
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:43,600
- <i>Ask my Zainab!
- </i>Perform the rituals, Qazi Sahib!

850
01:38:43,630 --> 01:38:47,870
Beat and throw him by the pond
and someone inform the police.

851
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:49,900
Perform the rituals, Qazi Sahib!

852
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,270
Zainab, my daughter.

853
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:53,800
You father gave me the right,

854
01:38:53,830 --> 01:38:55,170
..to marry you,

855
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:59,070
with your uncle Ali Bakhsh's son
Numan Bakhsh of Barki...

856
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:05,900
through the customs and traditions...

857
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,000
Do you accept the marriage?

858
01:39:08,600 --> 01:39:10,500
Do you accept the marriage?

859
01:39:11,300 --> 01:39:14,100
- Do you accept the marriage?
- Hmm!

860
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:16,500
Yes, I do.

861
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,100
Leave him here.

862
01:39:22,900 --> 01:39:24,100
Guddi!

863
01:39:47,230 --> 01:39:48,800
Look, Guddi!

864
01:39:49,730 --> 01:39:53,700
The cruel are taking
my Zainab forcefully.

865
01:39:54,930 --> 01:39:57,000
I can't even walk!

866
01:39:57,500 --> 01:40:00,300
How can I take you
to your mother?

867
01:40:01,670 --> 01:40:06,800
If your cries can bring her back,
then cry louder, Guddi.

868
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:08,530
Cry louder!

869
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:10,930
Cry louder, Guddi!

870
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,600
Hey, take the child!

871
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:14,700
What is this? Take it.

872
01:40:14,900 --> 01:40:16,500
Hey, get up!!

873
01:40:16,770 --> 01:40:18,600
Romeo. Come!

874
01:40:19,630 --> 01:40:21,700
<i>I'll handle your case.</i>

875
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:25,600
<i>It's all about property, right?
Take fifty-fifty.</i>

876
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:28,550
Lady, actually...
You're not listening to me.

877
01:40:30,500 --> 01:40:36,200
Boota Singh, you've been charged
for entering Pakistan illegally.

878
01:40:36,330 --> 01:40:41,200
My lord, like India,
my home is divided as well.

879
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:47,800
This innocent become Indian
and her mother, a Pakistani, sir!

880
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,200
And I...

881
01:40:52,870 --> 01:40:55,100
I'm devastated!

882
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:58,200
My home just shattered, sir!

883
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:00,320
Have mercy upon us!

884
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:06,400
Don't hesitate.
Tell the court what happened?

885
01:41:06,430 --> 01:41:09,700
Sir, my wife,
the mother of my child,

886
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:13,300
..was forcefully deported from India.

887
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,200
And even been remarried.

888
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:19,800
I just came looking for her, sir.

889
01:41:19,970 --> 01:41:24,100
Can you prove
that she is your wife?

890
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:26,700
Zainab, herself, is my proof, sir.

891
01:41:27,670 --> 01:41:31,400
She willingly married to me,
not forcefully.

892
01:41:31,730 --> 01:41:35,800
Would Zainab say the same,
you're saying?

893
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:37,800
Yes sir! Why not?

894
01:41:38,300 --> 01:41:41,700
According to the new agreement
between India and Pakistan,

895
01:41:41,770 --> 01:41:46,400
..women who wish to stay,
can't be deported.

896
01:41:46,830 --> 01:41:51,000
If Zainab takes your side
in the court,

897
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:52,900
..then she'll be returned to you.

898
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:55,300
Sir.

899
01:41:56,430 --> 01:42:00,300
Zainab is to be present in the court
on the next hearing.

900
01:42:00,370 --> 01:42:04,000
And till then, Boota Singh
will remain in the custody.

901
01:42:06,530 --> 01:42:08,000
Thank you.

902
01:42:16,300 --> 01:42:21,400
Not even our men faced the court yet,

903
01:42:21,430 --> 01:42:25,270
but now you're going to be!
Shame on you!

904
01:42:25,300 --> 01:42:30,270
- Why hurting her? It's not her fault.
- Yes, but yours, immoral!

905
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:33,400
Neither you've given birth
nor this day would've come.

906
01:42:33,430 --> 01:42:35,700
Did you married to Boota Singh?

907
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:38,100
Yes. I did.

908
01:42:38,130 --> 01:42:39,970
- Willingly?
- Yes.

909
01:42:40,030 --> 01:42:43,070
What!? Shame on you,
o shameless!

910
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:45,800
- And you wanna go back to him?
- Yes.

911
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:48,370
I already told you.

912
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:51,900
This second marriage is against
the (Islamic) law of Allah. A crime.

913
01:42:51,930 --> 01:42:53,700
Then why did you come back?

914
01:42:54,200 --> 01:42:55,900
To make us ashamed?

915
01:42:56,430 --> 01:42:59,200
Making us ashamed
facing the community? Why?

916
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:02,000
I didn't come
but forcefully deported.

917
01:43:02,070 --> 01:43:04,400
And you're gonna
tell the court the same?

918
01:43:04,570 --> 01:43:08,700
Yes, and also
that you've imprisoned me home.

919
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,900
Then listen to me carefully.

920
01:43:10,970 --> 01:43:14,200
Before you bring
any dishonor to the family,

921
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,470
there'll be five dead bodies.

922
01:43:16,530 --> 01:43:18,700
That infidel Boota Singh's,

923
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:23,900
..your mother's, yours,
mine and that bloody child's.

924
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:28,100
If you recognize Boota Singh
even by mistake,

925
01:43:28,130 --> 01:43:33,800
..you'll find his dead body
in the court room. Understand?

926
01:43:34,100 --> 01:43:35,200
Lets go!

927
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:49,500
- I'll solve this on the next hearing.
- What do I do?

928
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:52,300
<i>Zainab Begum be here!!</i>

929
01:44:11,530 --> 01:44:12,700
Zainab.

930
01:44:14,100 --> 01:44:18,400
This man says
that you married him in India.

931
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:22,100
Is that true
that you married him?

932
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:32,900
No.

933
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:38,800
Do you recognize him?

934
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,200
No.

935
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:52,400
Are you being forced, Zainab?

936
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:04,100
No.

937
01:45:16,500 --> 01:45:20,000
Zainab, you're denying
even my existence?

938
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:23,700
Not even recognizing me?

939
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:26,400
There must be a reason for that.

940
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:29,000
But do you recognize
Guddi, at least, or not?

941
01:45:29,270 --> 01:45:31,300
She is a part of your body.

942
01:45:31,570 --> 01:45:33,070
<i>Your own daughter!</i>

943
01:45:33,300 --> 01:45:35,500
I may have done wrong
to you, Zainab.

944
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:37,800
But she is innocent, isn't she.

945
01:45:38,370 --> 01:45:40,100
Don't spurn her, Zainab!

946
01:45:40,970 --> 01:45:43,400
You know what happens
to motherless children.

947
01:45:43,570 --> 01:45:46,100
For god's sake, Zainab,
come back.

948
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,700
Zainab!!

949
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:56,800
Boota Singh,
I understand your feelings.

950
01:45:57,570 --> 01:46:01,500
But you've to go back home
in India, tomorrow.

951
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:04,500
Home?

952
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:06,500
There is no home, now.

953
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,200
What home to return?

954
01:52:20,530 --> 01:52:22,000
Zainab!!!

955
01:52:48,030 --> 01:52:49,400
<i>Zainab.</i>

956
01:52:50,700 --> 01:52:51,900
<i>Zainab!</i>

957
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,200
<i>Zainab.</i>

958
01:52:57,100 --> 01:52:58,500
<i>Zainab!</i>

959
01:52:58,770 --> 01:53:00,200
Sardar ji?

960
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:02,300
Sardar ji!

961
01:53:03,230 --> 01:53:05,100
Sardar ji!!

962
01:53:07,470 --> 01:53:12,300
- <i>Who was that?
- Before the train.... suicide...</i>

963
01:53:12,370 --> 01:53:16,600
<i>- ...but body didn't cut... miracle...
- ...that he came from India.</i>

964
01:53:16,630 --> 01:53:18,900
<i>Yeah, I heard that too.</i>

965
01:53:19,500 --> 01:53:22,370
- <i>..but who was he?
- ..the child is survived.</i>

966
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:27,800
- <i>...that's God's wish...
- ...jumped before the train...</i>

967
01:53:27,970 --> 01:53:29,800
Hey, that is Boota Singh!

968
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:33,800
I saw him in the court, yesterday.

969
01:53:34,630 --> 01:53:37,900
His wife didn't recognize him there.

970
01:53:39,170 --> 01:53:42,400
And this child is his daughter.

971
01:53:42,630 --> 01:53:44,100
- Yeah.
- Search him...

972
01:53:44,130 --> 01:53:46,000
..there may be a
letter or something.

973
01:53:46,770 --> 01:53:49,100
Here is a letter addressing Zainab.

974
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,300
Who is Zainab?

975
01:53:51,630 --> 01:53:53,200
Zainab is his wife.

976
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,900
"Village and post office, Barki"

977
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,900
Read aloud,
so that we all can hear you.

978
01:53:59,730 --> 01:54:01,670
"Village and post office, Barki.

979
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:06,600
"Dear Zainab, I can understand
why you lied to the court.

980
01:54:06,870 --> 01:54:09,900
"But tell me what do I do?

981
01:54:10,230 --> 01:54:13,800
"Neither I can live in India
nor Pakistan.

982
01:54:13,930 --> 01:54:17,100
"Where should I go?
You're my world.

983
01:54:17,200 --> 01:54:20,500
"I couldn't get you back
and can't live without you.

984
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:22,400
"So I'm leaving this world,

985
01:54:22,600 --> 01:54:25,200
"..taking Guddi along with me.

986
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:30,600
"Because, after me, there is nobody
to take care of her. Even you're not.

987
01:54:31,330 --> 01:54:35,900
"My last wish
is to be buried in your village.

988
01:54:36,200 --> 01:54:43,000
"May be someday
you visit my grave with a flower.

989
01:54:44,200 --> 01:54:45,800
"Your Boota Singh."

990
01:54:57,930 --> 01:55:00,200
Amazing! Great!

991
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:04,800
A lover must be like Boota Singh!

992
01:55:06,930 --> 01:55:12,000
His wife lied, didn't even
recognized him in the court.

993
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,700
But look at him.

994
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:21,900
He hopes to meet her
even after death.

995
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:27,600
We Lahoris make vow...

996
01:55:27,800 --> 01:55:31,600
..to fulfill Boota Singh's last wish.

997
01:55:31,970 --> 01:55:35,400
Lets take Boota Singh
to Barki. Lets go.

998
01:55:35,500 --> 01:55:37,400
Yeah, yeah!
Pick him up.

999
01:55:37,430 --> 01:55:46,900
- Martyr-in-Love Boota Singh...
- Zindabad! Zindabad! (Is immortal)

1000
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:48,800
Sardar ji?

1001
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:54,700
- Sardar ji! Sardar ji!!
- Close the door. She's got crazy!!

1002
01:55:54,770 --> 01:55:56,200
No!!!!

1003
01:55:59,400 --> 01:56:00,670
Zainab!

1004
01:56:03,530 --> 01:56:05,000
Hold her.

1005
01:56:08,270 --> 01:56:22,000
- Martyr-in-Love Boota Singh...
- Zindabad! Zindabad!

1006
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:24,500
Take this bier back!

1007
01:56:25,670 --> 01:56:29,200
- No <i>Kafir</i> (infidel) is gonna be buried here!
- Hey!!

1008
01:56:29,500 --> 01:56:31,500
Boota Singh was not a <i>Kafir.</i>

1009
01:56:32,270 --> 01:56:38,300
He was a true man.
His religion was just love.

1010
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:44,170
- Fulfilling his last wish is our duty.
- We'd shed all you blood.

1011
01:56:44,200 --> 01:56:46,700
- But not let this body buried here.
- Right?

1012
01:56:46,730 --> 01:56:47,950
Not let bury. Not let bury.

1013
01:56:47,970 --> 01:56:49,900
Hey, listen carefully!

1014
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:55,000
We know our duty as well.
Hey, lets step forward! Come on.

1015
01:57:01,630 --> 01:57:05,800
I can arrest you all
for disturbing peace.

1016
01:57:07,430 --> 01:57:12,900
It may bring dishonor
 to the dead body if buried here.

1017
01:57:13,070 --> 01:57:16,870
<i>People who beaten him,</i>

1018
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:18,930
<i>..imagine what they'd do
with his dead body!</i>

1019
01:57:19,070 --> 01:57:22,870
<i>They'd throw it before the dogs.</i>

1020
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:25,470
<i>Take my suggestion,
take it to Lahore,</i>

1021
01:57:25,570 --> 01:57:30,500
..and bury him there
with all the respects and rituals.

1022
01:57:30,530 --> 01:57:33,900
You're absolutely right, inspector.

1023
01:57:34,030 --> 01:57:36,700
We were going
to make a huge mistake.

1024
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:42,200
We should bury him in Lahore.
You're right.

1025
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:45,500
The inspector is right, friends.

1026
01:57:45,530 --> 01:57:48,470
- We must go Lahore.
- Yes! Lets go.

1027
01:57:48,530 --> 01:58:01,400
- Martyr-in-Love Boota Singh...
- Zindabad! Zindabad!

1028
01:58:04,400 --> 01:58:07,600
To erect a memorial
in the memory of Boota Singh,

Lahoris donated with open hearts,

1030
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:12,770
and a trust was formed...

1031
01:58:13,630 --> 01:58:18,400
..that would look after this grave,
and organize an annual festival.

1032
01:58:21,370 --> 01:58:25,600
That trust took responsibility
of the education...

1033
01:58:25,630 --> 01:58:29,600
and care of Boota Singh's daughter.

1034
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:41,100
Look, father, I'm here
with your son-in-law, today.

1035
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:48,800
Bless him that he love me
the way you loved my mother.

1036
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:53,100
My Lord, bless us the ability
to pay respect.
