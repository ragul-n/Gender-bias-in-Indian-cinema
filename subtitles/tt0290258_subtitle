1
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:37,198
Mr. K. K. did summon me?

2
00:02:39,568 --> 00:02:41,468
Keep this in mind, acp choughule

3
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,664
I shouldn't have to
remember you again!

4
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,264
Okay.

5
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:50,141
- You have to present yourself
here daily, without fail! - Yes!

6
00:02:50,245 --> 00:02:53,146
- Yes.- If you get
thrown out of K. K's service...

7
00:02:53,248 --> 00:02:56,149
...and lose the income
you receive through it..

8
00:02:56,251 --> 00:03:00,415
..then all your whims and vices
will beggar your official pay!

9
00:03:00,522 --> 00:03:03,787
I'll be there morning and
night Sir! Give me a chance!

10
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,087
In the morning, our truck
will be laden with goods...

11
00:03:08,197 --> 00:03:10,495
...and proceed from
Dahisar to Coloba!

12
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:15,103
Fix it so that the truck
does not have to stop...

13
00:03:15,204 --> 00:03:18,332
...for any reason
other than trafic signale.

14
00:03:18,474 --> 00:03:21,102
Sir, arranging for this,
in one night...

15
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:26,546
...and a truck laden with
good going through the city.

16
00:03:27,149 --> 00:03:28,677
If i could get a day'e notice...

17
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:31,118
The truck will leave
Dahisar tomorrow it self!

18
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:35,122
If it doesn't reach Colaba,
you will be disposed off!

19
00:03:35,224 --> 00:03:39,820
And sent to place where
Earth is a distant sight!

20
00:03:40,562 --> 00:03:44,123
The truck will reach there. The
truck will get there, Mr. K.K!

21
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:47,293
- Choughule! - Yes! - The
number of the truck is...

22
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:26,366
Amazing, someone has
brought news of my defeat...

23
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:29,702
...and that person
stands so close to me?

24
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:35,110
When failure comes
face to face with K.K...

25
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:37,309
...it has face K.K's ire!

26
00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:42,620
Remember, that day in the
college and the cricket match?

27
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,718
We were one down and batting.

28
00:04:46,695 --> 00:04:49,129
The bowler made the delivery,
i went forward...

29
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:54,134
...the ball glanced off my pads.
The fielders appealed...

30
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:58,400
...i turned, and the umpire
raised a finger against me!

31
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:00,808
K.K was out!

32
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:05,805
Do you remember how you had it out?

33
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:10,709
Thought the umpire's
head was a ball and...out!

34
00:05:11,453 --> 00:05:13,080
The umpire was out!

35
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,091
I was young and it
was my first crime...

36
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,161
...so the court forgave me.

37
00:05:21,463 --> 00:05:23,490
But this wasn't
just my first crime...

38
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:27,334
...it was the first link in the
chain of my criminal career!

39
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,132
At that time, the umpire was right!

40
00:05:31,673 --> 00:05:33,231
But i couldn't accept it!

41
00:05:34,143 --> 00:05:37,670
Today, you are wrong,
and don't accept it!

42
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:41,782
Who is lording over
the city, right now?

43
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,545
How dare this person go against me?

44
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,551
He is trying to beat
me on my own turf?

45
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:51,782
I can't accept my defeat!

46
00:05:52,694 --> 00:05:56,130
A.K search every nook
and cranny of the city!

47
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:59,129
I want my goods back!

48
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:01,126
Along with the
corpse of that person!

49
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:07,468
I'm touching your feet, Sir!

50
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:10,568
You may touch my feet,
when your hands are free!

51
00:06:12,815 --> 00:06:15,079
Hariya! - Yes, Sir.

52
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:19,747
- How much are those goods of
K.K's worth? - 5 crores, Sir!

53
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,090
The bugger sent me
to jail for 7 years...

54
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:26,787
...and meanwhile seems to
have done well for himself!

55
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:34,400
And in the jail, for 7 years, i
drew his picture on the walls.

56
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:41,302
For 7 years, on the jail walls,
that's all that i did!

57
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:46,438
I have just been planning
strategies, against K.K!

58
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,218
I have finally made the first move!

59
00:06:51,854 --> 00:06:54,118
Now that jerk will serve me...

60
00:06:54,223 --> 00:07:01,095
...with readymade meals
i'll eat on and on!

61
00:07:01,263 --> 00:07:05,393
Should i call up K.K?

62
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,798
He has just been
scammed out of 5 crores!

63
00:07:08,437 --> 00:07:10,667
He won't be able to
utter a word right now!

64
00:07:11,506 --> 00:07:15,533
Let the jerk flop around a bit!
Like a fish taken out of water!

65
00:07:16,178 --> 00:07:21,275
K.K must have already hauled the
police over the coals, for this!

66
00:07:21,383 --> 00:07:24,546
He may be acting cunning with
the help of Inspector Choughule!

67
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:28,079
This black marketeering of his...

68
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,649
...is a white collar job for
these decent folk, Hariya!

69
00:07:31,593 --> 00:07:34,084
The police officers
are also auctioned off!

70
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,630
Name a high price, and buy
a Choughule, for yourself!

71
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:41,098
Now, i will also place my bid...

72
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:46,368
...in this auction of Khaki uniforms!

73
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,710
Sir, you summoned me?

74
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:00,155
Inspector Vijay, an
empty truck was found...

75
00:08:00,155 --> 00:08:01,555
...on the Bombay Poona Highway!

76
00:08:01,557 --> 00:08:05,150
No report was filed at
any police station...

77
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,459
...but it seems, bullets were fired,
and the truck was looted!

78
00:08:09,097 --> 00:08:10,689
Please investigate this matter.

79
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:14,458
Vijay, Inspector Vijay!

80
00:08:14,803 --> 00:08:22,403
If you are unable to respect
your seniors or to take orders...

81
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:24,842
...then get yourself transferred!

82
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:29,080
Sir, the criminals you have told
me to find out about...

83
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:32,085
...i heard it, and i
also heard the order...

84
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:35,679
...that is given, once
the criminals are caught!

85
00:08:36,191 --> 00:08:37,483
To release those criminals!

86
00:08:38,327 --> 00:08:41,728
It may have become your habit to
catch criminals to release them.

87
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:44,932
I am trying to inculcate that habit!

88
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:50,103
The law and order
that governs society...

89
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:52,673
...has placed a limit on our power!

90
00:08:52,808 --> 00:08:54,298
We can't cross it, can we?

91
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:58,105
Some officers, like you and me,
Sir who're trapped in limits...

92
00:08:58,213 --> 00:09:01,614
...whereas, 75% of the police
uniforms disguise criminals!

93
00:09:02,284 --> 00:09:05,348
Who either commit illegal
activities or have them committed.

94
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:08,045
Its not as if i have turned a
blind eye to the fact that...

95
00:09:08,156 --> 00:09:12,684
...our department has a handful
of honest officers, like you!

96
00:09:13,362 --> 00:09:16,763
With their support i'm
fighting crime thriving in this city!

97
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:20,166
Yes, i have got a new
ACP transferred here.

98
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:22,769
He will join up for duty tomorrow.

99
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:24,901
What difference is a new
officer going to make, Sir?

100
00:09:25,374 --> 00:09:27,467
Criminals are not a few
people, they are a clan!

101
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,173
What difference can a few honest
officers & their service arms...

102
00:09:31,179 --> 00:09:33,306
...make to the
strength of organised crime?

103
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:39,782
But Sir, so long as i am wearing
a uniform, i will keep the faith.

104
00:09:54,536 --> 00:10:01,635
Come on, get down! Out of the way!
Come on! Go on the footpath!

105
00:10:04,346 --> 00:10:06,746
Tell me, has the police
landed up early for a change?

106
00:10:07,215 --> 00:10:09,115
I don't know! - Hey listen!

107
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:13,678
Did you people see that?

108
00:10:13,822 --> 00:10:15,380
This is the power of the police!

109
00:10:15,724 --> 00:10:17,385
The innocent keep running away!

110
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:20,586
And the criminals, keep
strolling arm in arm with us!

111
00:10:20,862 --> 00:10:24,127
Come on guys, let's get to work!

112
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:26,524
Let's play at investigation first!

113
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:32,401
So Diwali was celebrated!

114
00:10:33,575 --> 00:10:35,736
Go on, check how many
firecrackers were burst!

115
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:38,235
What a fruitless exercise!

116
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,274
Hey, Ajay!

117
00:10:43,385 --> 00:10:44,409
Stop the car!

118
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:58,164
- License please! - Why?
What's the matter?

119
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,765
It's a serious matter Madam!

120
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,699
Show me, whatever i
ask you to show me!

121
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,800
Do you have any
other identification?

122
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:08,105
Have a look at my passport!

123
00:11:19,221 --> 00:11:22,816
This says, the identification
mark is a mole on your back!

124
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,658
May i see it?

125
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,184
If you don't mind.

126
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:31,131
Here you are, turn around!

127
00:11:41,176 --> 00:11:42,200
What's going on here?

128
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,477
Sir, he's checking the
identification mark!

129
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:45,603
Checking the mark, is he?

130
00:11:45,714 --> 00:11:47,304
-Have you seen his
identification? - No!

131
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:51,274
So, you didn't see. Madam,
before you go to such an extent.

132
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:53,386
First you should always
check the officer's i card.

133
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,751
Because, the one who is
standing here... he is a fake officer.

134
00:11:57,492 --> 00:12:00,222
He is in a habit of putting on a
uniform and seeing here and there.

135
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:01,286
Please leave!

136
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,354
Go on Madam!

137
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:15,366
So taking a chance, were you?

138
00:12:16,211 --> 00:12:19,612
Vijay, you might have surely
been a match box in your last birth.

139
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,475
You can't trap a
female and if i trap her...

140
00:12:21,483 --> 00:12:24,714
...then your match
stick starts burning.

141
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:26,514
Hey, come on track.

142
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,482
Or else you'll
remember your previous and...

143
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,582
...present birth at a time.

144
00:12:30,292 --> 00:12:32,783
Dear, if any intelligent
girl falls in your trap...

145
00:12:33,361 --> 00:12:35,295
...that day, you'll
be trashed by her.

146
00:12:55,183 --> 00:12:57,549
Amazing, i was quite rough,
while picking his pocket!

147
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,311
He still didn't feel it?

148
00:12:59,588 --> 00:13:04,491
Uncle, do you know, i
just committed a crime!

149
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:05,751
I picked your pocket!

150
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:09,719
Uncle, before i venture much
further on this path of crime...

151
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:11,392
...please stop me, Sir!

152
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,734
There is only one way for that!
Hand me over to the police!

153
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:19,105
No my dear, i know, that
whan with the rising prices...

154
00:13:19,207 --> 00:13:23,473
...and the struggle to live,
there is no way left, but this!

155
00:13:24,212 --> 00:13:27,477
Here, my dear, keep
this wallet with you!

156
00:13:28,216 --> 00:13:31,117
Look at this! Hands which
should have henna on them...

157
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:32,652
...are picking pockets!

158
00:13:36,157 --> 00:13:38,853
Old man! I was trying to
get henna on my hands!

159
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:40,785
I made a wrong
choice with the target!

160
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:43,453
Seems all the holy men have
come down from the Himalayas!

161
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:45,860
How strange these kind people are!

162
00:13:46,768 --> 00:13:49,134
Ritu, if your love
affair is so serious...

163
00:13:49,237 --> 00:13:53,333
...you can't have Vijay,
without committing a serious offence!

164
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:54,799
What should i do then?

165
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:57,734
Do you see that bag, there?

166
00:13:58,313 --> 00:14:00,144
Pick up that bag and run away!

167
00:14:00,282 --> 00:14:01,806
I? - Sure, i'm with you!

168
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:03,744
Come along!

169
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:13,289
Hey, my bag! Stop thief! A
thief stole the bag! Thief!

170
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:19,725
Sir, not here, there!

171
00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:21,693
Good day, Inspector!

172
00:14:23,338 --> 00:14:24,362
You're back here?

173
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:27,105
Well, you do know,
that i am helpless!

174
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,108
Sir, this girl picks bags...

175
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:31,508
In broad daylight, she
picks pockets and steals bags!

176
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:32,871
You are left watching!

177
00:14:32,881 --> 00:14:35,372
Then she comes to you,
saying, she has committed a crime!

178
00:14:35,384 --> 00:14:37,713
She wants to be booked for it,
only in this police station!

179
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:40,711
-Yes, but how do you know this?-
I've a request for all of you.

180
00:14:40,822 --> 00:14:42,146
You all please leave this place!

181
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,814
And you, get lost!

182
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,421
One moment, please!

183
00:14:46,461 --> 00:14:48,622
How can we just let her go?
She's committed a crime...

184
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,654
...she must be pinished!

185
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:50,822
Ajay, you too? - Yes.

186
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:53,530
Inspector, we are the
public of your beat!

187
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:55,125
Do you consider us
such enemies, that...

188
00:14:55,136 --> 00:14:56,633
...you won't even lodge a complaint!

189
00:14:56,705 --> 00:15:00,607
And do you love this girl so
much you will let her go scoot free?

190
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:04,076
If a journalist finds
out about this corruption...

191
00:15:04,179 --> 00:15:05,771
...he will ruin reputation!

192
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:09,216
- His honour is our
honour, right? - Yes!

193
00:15:09,317 --> 00:15:13,083
And any one of these
patriotic eye witnesses...

194
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:15,156
-... can spill this story
to a journalist! - Yes!

195
00:15:16,658 --> 00:15:20,253
Sir, matters are getting
out of hand! File the report!

196
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:22,694
- You do your work, go on! -
Inspector, i have a request!

197
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:26,096
Tell me. - Don't put her in jail!
Criminals don't improve in jail...

198
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:27,259
...they are created there!

199
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:30,428
I shall pay for her bail!
Excuse me a moment, come here, Sir!

200
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,137
You look like a very emotional guy!

201
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,370
Don't you understand this
is not a matter of theft?

202
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,740
This is an affair of the heart!

203
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:42,305
Just look at their faces?
Go on take a look!

204
00:15:42,417 --> 00:15:45,614
I get it! Inspector,
please put this girl in jail!

205
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,280
Yes, the matter is quite serious!

206
00:15:48,857 --> 00:15:50,591
If you don't put her in jail...

207
00:15:50,592 --> 00:15:52,721
..we will stage a protest
outside from tomorrow! Yes!

208
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:56,595
Inspector, it would ne better,
if you do put her in jail!

209
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:59,825
Come on everyone, let's go!
Thank you Sir! Thanks all of you!

210
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:03,069
If i need your help, we
shall meet again! Bye, bye.

211
00:16:04,105 --> 00:16:05,766
Oh my! What a grip!

212
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,405
- You like staying behind
bars, don't you? - You bet!

213
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,835
One hour inside the lock up
will teach you! Come let's go.

214
00:16:16,117 --> 00:16:17,345
Oh wow.

215
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:34,595
"My heart is restless for you."

216
00:16:34,736 --> 00:16:42,836
"I see you, and i feel a fever!"

217
00:17:13,441 --> 00:17:17,207
"My heart is restless for you."

218
00:17:17,312 --> 00:17:20,679
"My heart is restless for you."

219
00:17:20,782 --> 00:17:24,343
"My heart is restless for you."

220
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:27,488
"My heart is restless for you."

221
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,218
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

222
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:35,353
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

223
00:17:35,463 --> 00:17:38,626
"This is called love, my love!"

224
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:42,225
"I see you, and i feel a fever!"

225
00:17:42,337 --> 00:17:45,795
"This is called love, my love!"

226
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,109
"I see you, and i feel a fever!"

227
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:52,702
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

228
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:57,308
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

229
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:40,558
"My restless heart...

230
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,756
...God knows, what
has happened to it!"

231
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:47,564
"Tell me, where is my heart?"

232
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:50,695
"It is lost in dreams of you!"

233
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:54,734
"Since i have laid
eyes on you my love!"

234
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,243
"My fever just keeps on growing,
hear me, my love!"

235
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:01,645
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

236
00:19:01,749 --> 00:19:05,708
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

237
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,221
"This is called love, my love!"

238
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:12,521
"I see you, and i feel a fever!"

239
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:16,119
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

240
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,189
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

241
00:19:53,134 --> 00:19:56,365
"What kind of madness is this?"

242
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:59,836
"You are the only one i see!"

243
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:03,439
"There are thousands of
wonders in this world!"

244
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:06,739
"You are the only one i see desire!"

245
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:14,121
"My lips only say your name!
And my eyes see only you."

246
00:20:14,222 --> 00:20:17,521
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

247
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:21,527
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

248
00:20:21,629 --> 00:20:25,121
"My heart is restless for you."

249
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:28,293
"I see you, and i feel a fever!"

250
00:20:28,403 --> 00:20:31,804
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

251
00:20:31,906 --> 00:20:35,808
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

252
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,311
"This is called love, my love!"

253
00:20:39,414 --> 00:20:42,474
"When i see you, and i feel a fever!"

254
00:20:42,583 --> 00:20:46,212
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

255
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,619
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

256
00:20:49,724 --> 00:20:53,160
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

257
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:57,288
"It could be 103 degrees or 104!"

258
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:15,372
Patil!
- Sir. - Release her.

259
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,507
Yes sir.

260
00:21:16,617 --> 00:21:17,841
She has learnt a lesson now.

261
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,446
Come on, Inspector, i have
my hand in the right place!

262
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:24,386
You release me today,
i'll return tomorrow!

263
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:25,683
She won't improve!

264
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:27,518
She is incorrigible!

265
00:22:03,131 --> 00:22:06,658
Daata, when did you come?
I'd almost forgotten about you!

266
00:22:07,268 --> 00:22:11,534
K.K! This style of
yours is old hat now!

267
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,266
You forget favours
that you have done!

268
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:19,178
You took such
trouble to send me to jail!

269
00:22:20,648 --> 00:22:23,845
7 years, i thought
of only you in jail!

270
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,780
And as soon as i was
out i sent you a message.

271
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:29,313
Message?

272
00:22:29,657 --> 00:22:33,491
Have you been searching for your
missing father for past 5 hours?

273
00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:36,887
The same one who looted 5
crores worth of your goods!

274
00:22:38,366 --> 00:22:43,326
Look at me, K.K. I am that
missing father of yours!

275
00:22:48,776 --> 00:22:50,573
You are very fond of
being a father, Daata!

276
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,874
Then have the courage
to give birth, as well!

277
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,882
You can't give birth to a child,
so you adopted one instead?

278
00:23:00,454 --> 00:23:05,414
Try adopting me, and i'll
suck your blood from your body!

279
00:23:06,527 --> 00:23:08,290
Stay away from me, Daata!

280
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:12,226
And this thimbleful of water,
you have stolen from my ocean...

281
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:14,528
...it doesn't affect me one bit!

282
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:19,570
I shall convert this
ocean into a creek K.K!

283
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:25,703
You're lording it over the city,
with this Choughule as your man!

284
00:23:27,648 --> 00:23:33,245
So, i've become pally with cops,
after 7 years in jail!

285
00:23:34,655 --> 00:23:37,453
Besides, that 5 crores of
yours can be put to use as well!

286
00:23:38,492 --> 00:23:42,326
Daata, you'll need a long
life to spend this 5 crores!

287
00:23:44,498 --> 00:23:46,363
And sadly, your life
is not long anymore!

288
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:51,866
Watch the life lines, on your
palms grow shorter, after today!

289
00:23:56,845 --> 00:23:58,673
How did he get the information,
Choughule?

290
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,204
There must be an informer
in the police department!

291
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:02,740
All of them get sold off!

292
00:24:03,117 --> 00:24:04,277
You taught us well!

293
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:07,484
No one bids higher,
than you, Mr.K.K!

294
00:24:09,457 --> 00:24:12,756
It's not possible than Daata
has found a pal among the police!

295
00:24:14,395 --> 00:24:16,158
Give David a token
to rub out Daata...

296
00:24:17,732 --> 00:24:20,758
...before he begins
putting that 5 crores to work...

297
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:24,296
...put an end to his life!

298
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,444
Come on!

299
00:24:41,489 --> 00:24:42,854
Daata!

300
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:57,698
Listen!

301
00:25:00,508 --> 00:25:02,633
Send a telegram to this
address to Capt. Vikas Sood!

302
00:25:02,643 --> 00:25:04,167
Please tell him to come immediately.

303
00:25:04,178 --> 00:25:08,410
And yes, 24246! That's the
number in Cochin, get it for me!

304
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,742
If Captain Sood calls, tell
him his wife is in hospital!

305
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:14,284
Leave averything, and do this first!

306
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:21,418
Uncle!

307
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,824
How is my mother?

308
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:27,358
She's fine my boy!

309
00:25:32,807 --> 00:25:33,831
How are you?

310
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:38,708
Uncle, why did those
people shoot at my mother?

311
00:25:41,482 --> 00:25:42,540
Did you see those people?

312
00:25:43,217 --> 00:25:46,709
Uncle, call my papa
and ask him to come here!

313
00:25:47,221 --> 00:25:49,781
He will make my mother all right!

314
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:55,519
Yes, my boy! But son,
did you see those people?

315
00:25:56,564 --> 00:26:00,261
Inspector, can i speak
to you for a minute?

316
00:26:01,369 --> 00:26:03,337
-Tell me. - My
name is Nisha Tiwari.

317
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:05,194
I am a responsible journalist.

318
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,774
I brought that woman and
that child to the hospital.

319
00:26:08,109 --> 00:26:10,475
I have sent word to
her husband, Capt. Sood!

320
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:13,412
Please go back to
the police station...

321
00:26:13,714 --> 00:26:16,547
...and record this
complaint in a huge register...

322
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,277
...and your job is done!

323
00:26:19,253 --> 00:26:21,346
Look, i have to
take their statements.

324
00:26:21,722 --> 00:26:23,815
Even if you do find
out who's the criminal...

325
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:26,821
...i can tell you for a
fact you can't harm him!

326
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:30,827
You may go through the
motions of an investigation...

327
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,565
...but don't trouble that child!

328
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,363
Look Madam keep your advice to
yourself and i know my duty...

329
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:40,167
Everyone knows the duty of the
police & how they carry it out!

330
00:26:40,541 --> 00:26:43,533
The police officers sit in the
police and doze all day long!

331
00:26:43,744 --> 00:26:46,679
Criminals roam
around without any fear!

332
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,312
I admit that all
uniforms are the same colour!

333
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,513
But the thought,
emotions, & humanity...

334
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:53,314
...of the men wearing
them are different.

335
00:26:53,654 --> 00:26:55,588
I was present at the
scene of the crime.

336
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,690
I saw everything with my own eyes...

337
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:00,190
...i could pick out the
criminal in a crowd.

338
00:27:01,295 --> 00:27:04,662
You have an eye
witness standing before you.

339
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:08,734
You have a lot to say about
honesty humanity, don't you?

340
00:27:09,437 --> 00:27:12,600
Now we shall see, how much the
uniform has coloured your blood!

341
00:27:25,719 --> 00:27:26,743
This is the man!

342
00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:29,788
This is David, the hitman!

343
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:34,353
Patil! - Yes Sir!

344
00:27:34,728 --> 00:27:37,561
I want all the information
on David in half an hour!

345
00:27:42,636 --> 00:27:44,297
Please give the phone
to the Commissioner!

346
00:27:44,638 --> 00:27:47,163
- Inspector Vijay
here Sir! - Tell me.

347
00:27:47,241 --> 00:27:49,409
I want a warrant for David
fot today's shootout, Sir!

348
00:27:49,477 --> 00:27:51,377
-Any witnesses? - We
have an eye witness!

349
00:27:51,479 --> 00:27:52,741
Get the papers ready!

350
00:27:52,847 --> 00:27:55,179
Thank you sir. Thank you very much.

351
00:27:57,218 --> 00:27:59,448
Sir, David has been in the
lock up for the past 2 days!

352
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,788
In the lock up? At
which police station?

353
00:28:02,089 --> 00:28:03,713
The one under Mr.
Choughule's command.

354
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:06,384
Mr. Choughule's station!

355
00:28:10,164 --> 00:28:14,328
Tell me, where were you,
between 10 and 12 o'clock!

356
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,405
Tell me, whose token did you accept?

357
00:28:23,611 --> 00:28:26,273
Who helped you to get out
of the jail for 2 hours?

358
00:28:26,614 --> 00:28:33,144
Tell me, where
were you for 2 hours?

359
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,278
Sir! - What is it?

360
00:28:34,388 --> 00:28:35,412
This is wrong!

361
00:28:35,723 --> 00:28:38,749
You can't come to Choughule's
station & beat him just like...

362
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:41,521
I'm hitting him, and
you're feeling the pain?

363
00:28:42,463 --> 00:28:45,591
I am going to uncover
Choughule's schemes, soon!

364
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:46,723
Get out from here.

365
00:28:48,636 --> 00:28:52,231
Tell me, where were you for 2 hours?

366
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,132
Who gave you the
permission to leave?

367
00:28:54,141 --> 00:28:56,609
Tell me!

368
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,305
I'll tell you, Inspector!

369
00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:07,246
I'll tell you! - Tell me! Quickly!

370
00:29:10,424 --> 00:29:14,190
- You? - The police station
is not your personal fiefdom!

371
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:18,698
You can't just enter and
behave like a wild man!

372
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,793
You are an inspector, stay
within the limits of your duty!

373
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:25,770
But Sir... - Not with your fists!

374
00:29:26,774 --> 00:29:30,141
Who permitted you to
come here and beat him up?

375
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,474
If you are so fond of
behaving like a thug...

376
00:29:34,582 --> 00:29:37,210
...take this uniform off & hang
out at a corner cigarette stall!

377
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:39,513
You can bully people in
the surrounding area, then!

378
00:29:40,621 --> 00:29:44,785
There are many unemployed
youth of your age doing the same!

379
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:50,229
If you wear this uniform
and behave any way you like...

380
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:51,555
...you will be stripped of it!

381
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:53,490
Sorry sir.

382
00:30:05,212 --> 00:30:07,840
Who? Who is it?

383
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:16,187
Vijay! You scared me so much!

384
00:30:16,657 --> 00:30:19,152
What about what happened to me,
when i saw brother suddenly?

385
00:30:19,493 --> 00:30:22,485
Forget it! You are all
in on this conspiracy!

386
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,798
Now you see, what happened to me?

387
00:30:25,366 --> 00:30:26,856
That was your brother's idea!

388
00:30:27,434 --> 00:30:29,265
Not to let you know
about the transfer!

389
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:32,403
And Shrivastav Uncle talks
about new inspector...

390
00:30:32,506 --> 00:30:34,633
...as if i don't know him,
and neither does he!

391
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,401
Papa kept telling us all about you!

392
00:30:37,578 --> 00:30:39,512
And you all ganged up against me!

393
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,672
Shall we go? You're in the
kitchen as soon as you're here!

394
00:30:42,683 --> 00:30:43,877
Everyone is coming to dinner!

395
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:48,749
Sister, i shall get great
food after a very long time!

396
00:30:48,856 --> 00:30:49,880
Should i call Ajay?

397
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,885
He's coming! He knows!

398
00:30:52,593 --> 00:30:54,823
I see, so that guy
is in on this too!

399
00:30:55,796 --> 00:30:57,627
Punk, he claims to be
a great pal of mine!

400
00:30:58,532 --> 00:30:59,556
Where is Chinky?

401
00:31:01,335 --> 00:31:03,633
Hey, my Chinky?

402
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:10,367
Live long.
- Live long.

403
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,784
You're amazing brother,
you could have told me!

404
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:20,410
I could have made
for some arrangements!

405
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:21,786
We wanted to surprise you!

406
00:31:22,289 --> 00:31:26,487
I also wanted to see how you are
fulfilling your police duties!

407
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:30,594
Brother, i didn't say
anything at the police station!

408
00:31:31,699 --> 00:31:35,260
I had to respect your uniform,
but you were wrong there!

409
00:31:36,303 --> 00:31:40,262
- Wrong? - He was about to
confess, and you came in!

410
00:31:40,574 --> 00:31:43,475
How was i to know that
he was about to confess?

411
00:31:44,178 --> 00:31:45,770
But what is his name?

412
00:31:46,313 --> 00:31:50,875
David? He was in jail for
drunk & disorderly behaviour!

413
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:53,219
And you pounced on him, as if he...

414
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:55,618
Forget it brother! As if
you don't know anything!

415
00:31:57,458 --> 00:32:02,691
Innocents are injured and an eye
witness recognises David's photo.

416
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:07,227
And when we seek him out, we
fint that he is in lock up...

417
00:32:07,334 --> 00:32:09,825
...on a small time charge!

418
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:11,562
What are you trying to say?

419
00:32:11,572 --> 00:32:14,769
Just this, that using
their rotten tricks...

420
00:32:14,875 --> 00:32:17,241
...criminals fool us very easily!

421
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:21,375
Actually we are the ones,
who grow criminals!

422
00:32:22,116 --> 00:32:24,541
The fact that police & criminals
are in cahoots, is not new!

423
00:32:24,551 --> 00:32:27,247
That's enough! If you
can't respect your department...

424
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:30,448
...and your uniform,
throw the uniform away!

425
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,319
Wonderful, what a
reunion of 2 brothers!

426
00:32:34,228 --> 00:32:37,629
Such love, that on meeting,
taking off clothes is necessary!

427
00:32:38,365 --> 00:32:39,389
Bless me, brother!

428
00:32:41,435 --> 00:32:44,871
Brother, you married sister in law,
to eat meals cooked by her!

429
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:50,474
We're bachelors, and eating out
has ruined our sense of taste!

430
00:32:50,577 --> 00:32:53,876
So, let's eat to our
heart's content, and later...

431
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:55,671
...both of you can argue at leisure!

432
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:58,879
Sister, good day!

433
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:04,214
- You're here? - Bless
me later, feed me first!

434
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:07,524
Mr. Vijay, do you intend to eat?

435
00:33:08,262 --> 00:33:09,920
Or has the piping hot
shout filled you up?

436
00:33:10,464 --> 00:33:12,489
Stop it, man! What's wrong is wrong!

437
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,730
Elsewhere, people commit
their sins in hading!

438
00:33:14,735 --> 00:33:17,568
And as for our department,
it's all out in the open!

439
00:33:17,671 --> 00:33:19,696
Then go ahead and free
yourself from this world!

440
00:33:20,641 --> 00:33:22,836
Which has too much evil and
too little good happening!

441
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:27,607
Wear a holy man's clothes,
and set out on a pilgrimage!

442
00:33:28,482 --> 00:33:29,506
Who has stopped you?

443
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:34,750
Brother, you too would
have seen red...

444
00:33:35,656 --> 00:33:39,319
...if you had seen that woman
bleeding & her son's condition!

445
00:33:49,503 --> 00:33:53,564
Papa!

446
00:33:54,441 --> 00:33:57,467
- Come to me! My son!
- Papa has come!

447
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:00,406
How are you, son? Are you all right?

448
00:34:03,617 --> 00:34:04,709
How is your mother?

449
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,276
She died!

450
00:34:29,643 --> 00:34:31,508
Sir, the Nagapada case is
scheduled for today!

451
00:34:31,745 --> 00:34:34,839
I have prepared the sheet, it
has to be submitted in court!

452
00:34:35,482 --> 00:34:36,506
To tell you the truth...

453
00:34:36,617 --> 00:34:38,312
May i come in?
- Yes.

454
00:34:44,224 --> 00:34:46,192
My name is Capt. Vikas Sood!

455
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:51,256
I have just set fire to
my wife's funeral pyre!

456
00:34:52,499 --> 00:34:54,660
She was injured in day
be fore's incident...

457
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:58,866
...yesterday, she breathed her last.

458
00:34:59,773 --> 00:35:00,840
Which incident was this?

459
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,800
Sir, this is the shootout...

460
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:06,506
I just want to know this!

461
00:35:07,514 --> 00:35:10,813
Who are the suspects
in that shootout?

462
00:35:11,385 --> 00:35:13,649
Capt. Sood, i am handling the case.

463
00:35:14,721 --> 00:35:16,746
We are trying, but so far...

464
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:19,354
I am ashamed to see
your helplessness!

465
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:22,823
We army men, take care
of the entire country!

466
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,560
And you cops can't take
care of a single city?

467
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:29,735
-Captain Sood! - If criminals
& crime keep scaring people...

468
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:33,633
...then these police stations
this crowd of men in Khaki...

469
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,766
...and senior officers like
you, will be meaningless!

470
00:35:37,477 --> 00:35:39,638
-Come along with me, Sir,
i will... - No, Inspector!

471
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:44,742
I need to understand what he meant!

472
00:35:46,553 --> 00:35:48,783
If you ever do understand...

473
00:35:49,756 --> 00:35:54,318
...remember that an innocent,
has lost his mother!

474
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:58,794
When he asks me,
where is his mother...

475
00:35:58,899 --> 00:36:01,465
...i will have to say, that his
mother was killed by the cops!

476
00:36:05,305 --> 00:36:06,329
Captain!

477
00:36:12,713 --> 00:36:14,681
If you are in the city
for some days...

478
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:18,443
...i will earn your trust
for the cops.

479
00:36:19,453 --> 00:36:20,477
That is a promise!

480
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:25,158
I'll try to find an answer to
your son's question, too.

481
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:55,552
Feel the pain! Now you
know the pain i feel!

482
00:36:56,223 --> 00:36:58,623
The police looted my lair!

483
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,391
And you punks heard the
police sirens, and ran here...

484
00:37:03,497 --> 00:37:04,721
...to dry off your wet pants!

485
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,691
Bless me, Daata!

486
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:09,564
Hariya! - Your command, Daata!

487
00:37:10,303 --> 00:37:14,797
Did you see K.K's antics? He and
Choughule looted all my stuff!

488
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,472
They have made ne a laughing stock!

489
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:20,745
No, Daata, this
isn't K.K's handiwork!

490
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:23,808
His lairs were looted too!

491
00:37:25,385 --> 00:37:28,445
K.K's lairs too?

492
00:37:29,723 --> 00:37:31,723
Then did he call for the
military from the capital?

493
00:37:31,725 --> 00:37:37,357
No, Daata, officer Ashwin Kumar
who was transferred recently...

494
00:37:38,198 --> 00:37:40,097
...is flexing his muscles,
to show his power!

495
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:46,235
This new officer may
not befriend us.

496
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:51,308
But so what? There are
many ways to control him!

497
00:37:52,746 --> 00:37:55,544
Either buy him out, and
tame him no expenses spared!

498
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:01,244
Or, get him transferred to a place
which is far from here!

499
00:38:02,756 --> 00:38:09,787
Or else, use his family
members as life insurance!

500
00:38:11,364 --> 00:38:12,892
K.K sir, he is transferred recently.

501
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,634
So, you forget that.

502
00:38:17,604 --> 00:38:20,596
The other thing is that
if we murder an officer...

503
00:38:21,441 --> 00:38:24,205
...then the public won't leave us.

504
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:30,514
Yes, we have to see that if that
officer accepts bride...

505
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:34,587
...then what will be his amount.

506
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:43,760
Pinky my dear! See
what i have brought you!

507
00:38:44,631 --> 00:38:47,623
See, i have brought
you so many things!

508
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:55,533
- Here's my girl! See
what i got for you! - What?

509
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:58,436
A  TV!

510
00:38:58,545 --> 00:38:59,603
For your room.

511
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:05,549
Till you don't make new friends,
sit in the room and watch TV!

512
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:08,553
Papa, should i call Uncle? - Yes.

513
00:39:11,491 --> 00:39:14,119
Jyoti! - What is it? I'm cooking!

514
00:39:14,594 --> 00:39:17,791
Come here, and look! I
got you Chinese crockery!

515
00:39:18,598 --> 00:39:20,766
From now on, your food-will
be served in this crockery!

516
00:39:20,767 --> 00:39:21,791
Come here!

517
00:39:23,436 --> 00:39:25,531
These days, a lot of
your jobs happen without me!

518
00:39:26,606 --> 00:39:28,801
You got all this, without me?

519
00:39:29,509 --> 00:39:34,208
Well, there are a couple of jobs
that are impossible without you!

520
00:39:35,182 --> 00:39:36,740
You are sorely needed!

521
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:42,144
Aren't you needing me
a bit too early today?

522
00:39:43,456 --> 00:39:44,718
You've emptied your purse...

523
00:39:45,458 --> 00:39:47,756
...do you intend to
sleep on an empty stomach?

524
00:39:48,628 --> 00:39:51,654
I agree Papa called you
here for a special job...

525
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:54,167
...he got you a
huge official quarter!

526
00:39:54,734 --> 00:39:57,464
But your salary remains the same!

527
00:39:58,638 --> 00:40:00,162
Then why are you splurging,
this way?

528
00:40:00,207 --> 00:40:04,166
Madam, today, your
husband remembered...

529
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:07,440
...that he is the
assistant Commissioner of police!

530
00:40:08,415 --> 00:40:12,784
He controls the entire city, and
so should live with some style!

531
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:15,518
So i thought all these things...

532
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,455
...yes, the washing machine
will come tomorrow!

533
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:23,720
After seeing it, you will talk
a bit more respectfully to me!

534
00:40:24,664 --> 00:40:29,260
Because, in a day, at
lease 10, 20, 30 men salute me!

535
00:40:29,369 --> 00:40:31,860
The city folk may pamper you no end!

536
00:40:33,506 --> 00:40:35,565
I have always kept you in my heart!

537
00:40:36,576 --> 00:40:37,800
And that's where you'll stay!

538
00:40:39,379 --> 00:40:44,316
The washing machine made
you a bit too romantic!

539
00:40:44,517 --> 00:40:47,884
Brother, by the way, you were right!

540
00:40:48,688 --> 00:40:51,589
Women aren't
romantic at hill stations!

541
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:54,626
As she gets when in the market
or when she sees the shopping.

542
00:40:54,728 --> 00:40:57,492
See the effect?

543
00:40:58,531 --> 00:41:01,523
After seeing these goods,
the good man ha left you...

544
00:41:01,635 --> 00:41:02,829
...and joined hands with me!

545
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:05,827
This is called power!

546
00:41:07,274 --> 00:41:08,832
If you want to maintain this power...

547
00:41:09,476 --> 00:41:12,502
...start earning
money by underhand means!

548
00:41:14,481 --> 00:41:16,642
Your job provides ample
chances for that!

549
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:18,744
What great advice!

550
00:41:20,654 --> 00:41:25,489
I'll call your father & tell him
what his daughter advised me!

551
00:41:27,494 --> 00:41:29,758
Give your father this advice, Madam!

552
00:41:30,764 --> 00:41:32,857
His job provides ample chances too!

553
00:41:33,767 --> 00:41:37,726
This is one trhing that Brother
and Uncle have been unable to do.

554
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:42,737
They never earned by
underhand means, they never will!

555
00:41:43,443 --> 00:41:47,812
What trust inme! Here
you are! And watch for you!

556
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,413
I was wondering whether
i should give it ot not!

557
00:41:52,252 --> 00:41:54,584
You just might think
it's a bribe and...

558
00:41:55,588 --> 00:41:59,615
Brother the day, such an ill
gotten watch enters this house...

559
00:42:02,395 --> 00:42:03,857
...that day, time will stand still!

560
00:42:07,767 --> 00:42:08,825
Just be a bit careful!

561
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:10,961
If you feel danger,
then return back.

562
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:15,771
This new ACP Ashwin Kumar has
posted his men at all our lairs!

563
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:22,838
D.K, he is wearing
colored glasses now!

564
00:42:25,218 --> 00:42:29,848
We have sent some of
our stuff to his home!

565
00:42:31,491 --> 00:42:36,451
Do your business as coolly
as a lion feeds on prey!

566
00:42:39,566 --> 00:42:40,624
Excuse me.

567
00:42:41,735 --> 00:42:42,793
I am inspector Ajay Sinha.

568
00:42:43,503 --> 00:42:44,527
I need to search you!

569
00:42:45,238 --> 00:42:46,262
What do you mean?

570
00:42:46,373 --> 00:42:48,006
The police has been
searching for you!

571
00:42:48,241 --> 00:42:51,608
I've been informed, you carried
out a drug deal in this hotel.

572
00:42:52,512 --> 00:42:54,810
Drugs? You are mistaken, Inspector!

573
00:42:55,515 --> 00:42:57,506
The truth will be revealed!
Raise your hands!

574
00:42:57,617 --> 00:42:58,675
I say hands up, fast.

575
00:43:02,722 --> 00:43:06,419
-Ajay! - Sir, i just
received a report that she has...

576
00:43:06,526 --> 00:43:07,550
There's a limit to jokes!

577
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,555
- Do you know who she
is? - But Sir, i was...

578
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:14,632
Stop! Miss Nisha, i apologize,
on behalf of Ajay!

579
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:20,470
He is my friend. He's a
good guy but he loves to joke.

580
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:23,776
Your friend cracks good jokes.

581
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,305
Let me praise him a bit!

582
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:36,554
Ajay, i told you, the
day you meet such a girl...

583
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:37,680
Now i shall meet her!

584
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:39,923
You will see how
that ends too, Vijay!

585
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,262
If she doesn't come crying &
begging for love, i'll be shamed.

586
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,465
Come on, now! Enough of this!

587
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:56,265
You're here again?

588
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:57,400
Forgive me!

589
00:44:37,484 --> 00:44:39,315
Papa! - What's the matter, son?

590
00:44:41,354 --> 00:44:43,584
This is the man,
who killed my mother!

591
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:07,268
I'm beginning to get
jealous of this typewriter!

592
00:45:07,447 --> 00:45:10,143
You like it's company more than me!

593
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,581
Let's go out somewhere!

594
00:45:11,684 --> 00:45:14,346
Ajay, i have to complete this article
& send it to the press!

595
00:45:14,621 --> 00:45:19,217
The man to be released tomorrow
is guilty of a crime i witnessed.

596
00:45:19,225 --> 00:45:20,824
And he can't go
without any punishment!

597
00:45:20,827 --> 00:45:22,556
But Nisha, why are you
getting into it?

598
00:45:22,795 --> 00:45:26,424
How long will this go on,
Ajay? Someday, someone has to talk!

599
00:45:26,533 --> 00:45:27,830
This has to be stopped!

600
00:45:28,468 --> 00:45:30,729
These criminals have to be
made to pay for their crimes!

601
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:31,761
But who is this criminal?

602
00:45:32,472 --> 00:45:33,769
David!

603
00:46:12,712 --> 00:46:14,805
Your people get weapons
in your hands...

604
00:46:15,181 --> 00:46:19,550
...and you ruin a life
as and when you please!

605
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,816
You think this country
was gifted to you father?

606
00:46:25,124 --> 00:46:28,355
I'll kill you.

607
00:46:30,463 --> 00:46:34,365
I'll kill you, kill you bastard!

608
00:46:34,467 --> 00:46:35,559
Bastard!

609
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:38,535
Captain, you must have
shot a lot of bullets!

610
00:46:40,406 --> 00:46:41,898
Today, you will
have to face a bullet!

611
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:48,172
If you move a finger, i
shall press the trigger!

612
00:46:53,286 --> 00:46:54,378
Aunty?

613
00:47:02,161 --> 00:47:04,391
We have received such a
small guest for the first time!

614
00:47:05,498 --> 00:47:06,522
Who have you come with?

615
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:07,657
Nobody!

616
00:47:07,767 --> 00:47:09,325
-Are you Chinky's friend?
- Not at all!

617
00:47:10,303 --> 00:47:12,203
Does Ashwin Uncle live here?

618
00:47:12,438 --> 00:47:13,666
But who are you?

619
00:47:13,773 --> 00:47:14,797
Sonny!

620
00:47:15,108 --> 00:47:19,704
My Papa told me to give
this letter to Ashwin Uncle!

621
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:21,337
Where is your Papa?

622
00:47:21,614 --> 00:47:22,638
I don't know!

623
00:47:23,182 --> 00:47:24,342
Come along!

624
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,646
This letter is for you!

625
00:47:31,624 --> 00:47:32,648
Who is this little guy?

626
00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:34,226
Sonny! - Sonny?

627
00:47:37,263 --> 00:47:38,753
Respected ACP...

628
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,666
...you had promised
to give me justice!

629
00:47:44,771 --> 00:47:47,171
I read in the papers this morning.

630
00:47:47,807 --> 00:47:50,241
David was not charged, no
case was made against him.

631
00:47:50,343 --> 00:47:51,537
He is being freed today!

632
00:47:52,645 --> 00:47:55,307
Now, i shall get justice on my own!

633
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:58,180
I won't be able to
live without that!

634
00:47:58,651 --> 00:48:00,318
I don't know what's
going to happen to me!

635
00:48:00,687 --> 00:48:02,780
Please do take care of my son!

636
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,184
If it comes to sending
him to an orphanage...

637
00:48:07,293 --> 00:48:09,727
...make sure it's a good one!

638
00:48:10,363 --> 00:48:12,331
Tank you, Captain Sood!

639
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,592
What kind of behaviour is this?

640
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:19,130
Everyone wants to
implement his own brand of justice!

641
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:20,931
How can society go on this way?

642
00:48:21,708 --> 00:48:23,801
I know where and what Capt.
Sood is doing, right now!

643
00:48:24,177 --> 00:48:25,439
Please control your anger!

644
00:48:25,712 --> 00:48:27,036
The tittle boy will get scared!

645
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:31,743
I know what to do! Don't explain
to me. Go in and do your work!

646
00:48:32,185 --> 00:48:33,516
And take this child with you!

647
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:36,749
Your uncle scolded me as well!

648
00:48:37,323 --> 00:48:39,382
What is this? Who scolds an adult?

649
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,650
Who can explain to him?

650
00:48:41,728 --> 00:48:43,152
What is the matter, sister-in-law?

651
00:48:43,163 --> 00:48:44,452
Good thing you are here.

652
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:46,557
Capt. Sood sent a
letter with this child...

653
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:48,026
...and spoilt your brother's mood!

654
00:48:48,334 --> 00:48:50,461
Capt. Sood sent a letter?
I'll go and find out!

655
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,594
Come on dear.

656
00:48:58,211 --> 00:49:02,409
- Yes, Mr. Vijay! - Palande,
is Capt. Sood there?

657
00:49:02,515 --> 00:49:03,739
Yes, he is in the lock up!

658
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:07,517
- What? In the lock up?
- Yes Sir! - Why?

659
00:49:08,154 --> 00:49:11,419
- I don't know, Sir! - And
David? - He was set free!

660
00:49:12,225 --> 00:49:13,249
He was set free?

661
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,587
When? - Today!

662
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:24,192
These are straightforward
bail papers, ACP!

663
00:49:24,437 --> 00:49:26,200
Why are you taking
so long to read them?

664
00:49:27,707 --> 00:49:29,265
Release Capt. Sood!

665
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:33,403
Choughule's Sir feels very
bad, releasing an innocent!

666
00:49:34,614 --> 00:49:37,674
He's very happy when
criminals like David are released!

667
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:45,248
ACP Choughule, if you get
hit by a home truth some day...

668
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,426
...then go home today and think!

669
00:49:47,727 --> 00:49:49,260
How you are going
to end up, some day!

670
00:49:58,638 --> 00:49:59,662
Please.

671
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,164
Thank you, Vijay.

672
00:50:02,275 --> 00:50:05,176
I won't say Inspector Vijay,
because i hated the police!

673
00:50:06,479 --> 00:50:08,572
I now loathe them!

674
00:50:10,216 --> 00:50:12,377
I have had a glimpse of the
hollowness of this country!

675
00:50:13,286 --> 00:50:15,618
Termites like ACP, have
bored through the interior!

676
00:50:18,424 --> 00:50:21,393
And now, any day this country
can blow away in a strong wind!

677
00:50:23,763 --> 00:50:27,392
How long will you support it
alone with your bare hands?

678
00:50:27,767 --> 00:50:30,861
I am not alone!
You will stand by me!

679
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:38,266
When people like us get
together these worms are dead!

680
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:15,271
Hey my car! Stop thief!

681
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:24,849
Ganga, i gave you a car with 2 crores
worth of cocaine!

682
00:51:27,226 --> 00:51:28,625
And now, you've gone and lost it?

683
00:51:30,663 --> 00:51:34,531
Now, Ganga, don't stand
there with your head bowed!

684
00:51:35,768 --> 00:51:37,633
Now this isn't your fault!

685
00:51:39,171 --> 00:51:41,605
The open car was just 20 paces away!

686
00:51:42,775 --> 00:51:46,472
By the time you got back,
someone took the car off!

687
00:51:48,447 --> 00:51:50,347
How can this be your fault, Ganga?

688
00:51:55,388 --> 00:51:59,722
These legs are at fault,
which are so heavy...

689
00:52:01,127 --> 00:52:03,152
...my poor Ganga can't lift them!

690
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:10,224
Ganga it hurts, doesn't it?

691
00:52:10,736 --> 00:52:14,695
Hariya, Ganga is very dear to me!

692
00:52:15,541 --> 00:52:18,408
I can't bear to see his pain!

693
00:52:22,648 --> 00:52:25,242
He burnt my money up
to celebrate Diwali!

694
00:52:26,352 --> 00:52:27,785
And he wants to benefit from it!

695
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:31,187
I am not sorry
that my money is gone!

696
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:32,650
I have loads of money!

697
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,385
There's so much, it seems the
change generates more money!

698
00:52:37,496 --> 00:52:39,521
But the loss my
reputation suffered...

699
00:52:40,499 --> 00:52:42,262
...i won't be able to tolerate that!

700
00:52:46,505 --> 00:52:49,406
It's not my reputation! It's
like a woman from Jaunpur!

701
00:52:49,575 --> 00:52:52,635
With whom one can do any damn thing!

702
00:52:53,779 --> 00:52:55,337
Hariya! - Your command, Daata.

703
00:52:55,448 --> 00:52:56,540
I want my stuff back!

704
00:52:56,682 --> 00:53:00,209
I need to see if you can
risk your life for my honour!

705
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,451
-As you wish, Daata!
- Hurry up, Hariya, go!

706
00:53:02,555 --> 00:53:03,817
Daata's honour is at stake!

707
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,990
Here it comes again!

708
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,362
I am married.

709
00:53:19,939 --> 00:53:22,703
And Chinky is still too young!

710
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:27,902
Why is someone honking the horn
out there like a lovelorn Romeo?

711
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:30,978
This is the behaviour of a
person who is crazy in love!

712
00:53:32,018 --> 00:53:37,388
That may be so! But once one is
in love, one sounds like that!

713
00:53:38,824 --> 00:53:40,655
I think someone is
checking their horn!

714
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,360
Right in front of our house?

715
00:53:43,629 --> 00:53:45,358
Chinky, go and see who it is!

716
00:53:45,464 --> 00:53:47,329
She's not eaten yet! - She'll eat!

717
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:49,993
Let her go and see who it is!

718
00:53:51,537 --> 00:53:53,334
Hello Chinky.
- Hi.

719
00:53:53,439 --> 00:53:54,565
Do you know me?

720
00:53:54,674 --> 00:53:57,438
I don't know you!
- But i know you?

721
00:53:57,777 --> 00:53:59,836
I know your parents too!

722
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:02,607
- Is your uncle at home?
- Yes, but who are you?

723
00:54:02,982 --> 00:54:04,540
I am your prospective aunt!

724
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:07,346
- Call your uncle out! - Why
don't you come in with me?

725
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,286
No, my dear! Till your uncle doesn't
come to fetch her...

726
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:13,654
...your future aunt
can't come inside!

727
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,420
I'll call uncle!

728
00:54:17,496 --> 00:54:20,294
- Uncle! - Who is it,
Chinky, my child?

729
00:54:20,399 --> 00:54:23,334
My future aunty is here!
Let's go and fetch her!

730
00:54:23,436 --> 00:54:25,336
Has Ritu come?

731
00:54:26,005 --> 00:54:27,336
How do you know her?

732
00:54:27,907 --> 00:54:29,636
Ajay has told me everything!

733
00:54:30,009 --> 00:54:32,671
I talk to her on the phone daily!

734
00:54:33,612 --> 00:54:34,772
I'll fetch her, right away!

735
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,413
This is the first
time she has come home!

736
00:54:36,415 --> 00:54:38,349
i'll fetch her!

737
00:54:38,884 --> 00:54:40,511
Oh my God! you will
be the death of me!

738
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:47,358
Let's get out of here!

739
00:54:49,795 --> 00:54:51,854
What will Sister think?
I didn't even go in!

740
00:54:52,031 --> 00:54:55,626
- I had promised Chinky...- Look
don't become a relative, okay?

741
00:54:55,735 --> 00:54:59,501
What is this "Sister" chant now?
You're always up to something!

742
00:54:59,605 --> 00:55:04,008
Vijay, you may accept it or not! I
have you written in my fate!

743
00:55:04,677 --> 00:55:06,269
And where did you get this car from?

744
00:55:06,378 --> 00:55:09,279
This belongs to my friend!
I told her my sad story...

745
00:55:09,381 --> 00:55:12,908
...she cried and told me to
take the car right away!

746
00:55:13,452 --> 00:55:15,647
You and your friends, are
birds of the same feather!

747
00:55:15,855 --> 00:55:19,313
People who are in love, have
a totally different style!

748
00:55:19,425 --> 00:55:23,327
-Stop it! - Today, i
will seek out your heart!

749
00:55:47,653 --> 00:55:51,350
"You are a method of love!"

750
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:55,356
"You are the secret of my heart!"

751
00:55:55,828 --> 00:55:59,389
"You are a method of love!"

752
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:03,562
"You are the secret of my heart!"

753
00:56:03,936 --> 00:56:07,736
"My partner, my love!"

754
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:11,934
"You are the one i look up to!"

755
00:56:12,444 --> 00:56:19,373
"At least you could hear
the voice of my heart!"

756
00:56:20,586 --> 00:56:27,856
"At least you could hear
the voice of my heart!"

757
00:56:28,561 --> 00:56:32,622
"You are a method of love!"

758
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:01,353
"I am guilty of troubling you!"

759
00:57:01,961 --> 00:57:05,624
'I accept any punishment you give!"

760
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:09,757
"It's enough that you accept it!"

761
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:13,737
"My love has been paid back in full!"

762
00:57:18,043 --> 00:57:21,740
"I am guilty of troubling you!"

763
00:57:22,314 --> 00:57:25,943
'I accept any punishment you give!"

764
00:57:26,051 --> 00:57:29,851
"It's enough that you accept it!"

765
00:57:30,356 --> 00:57:33,848
"My love has been paid back in full!"

766
00:57:34,393 --> 00:57:41,799
"That's it, stay happy,
grace of my heart!"

767
00:57:42,701 --> 00:57:49,869
"That's it, stay happy,
grace of my heart!"

768
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:54,605
"You are a method of love!"

769
00:58:23,676 --> 00:58:27,271
"Just tell me, when you love me...

770
00:58:27,379 --> 00:58:31,713
...how will you keep
the promises of love?"

771
00:58:31,917 --> 00:58:35,284
"My love you will see for yourself...

772
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:39,346
...when you hold me close!"

773
00:58:43,996 --> 00:58:47,295
"Just tell me, when you love me...

774
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:51,563
...how will you keep
the promises of love?"

775
00:58:52,338 --> 00:58:56,297
"My love you will see for yourself...

776
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:59,605
...when you hold me close!"

777
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:03,310
"Tease me anyway your heart desires...

778
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:07,613
...play on the strings of my love!"

779
00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:12,256
"Tease me anyway your heart desires...

780
00:59:12,358 --> 00:59:15,850
...play on the strings of my love!"

781
00:59:16,328 --> 00:59:19,991
"You are a method of love!"

782
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:23,999
"You are the secret of my heart!"

783
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:28,500
"You are a method of love!"

784
00:59:28,741 --> 00:59:32,370
"You are the secret of my heart!"

785
00:59:32,578 --> 00:59:36,344
"My partner, my love!"

786
00:59:36,915 --> 00:59:40,544
"You are the one i look up to!"

787
00:59:40,919 --> 00:59:48,416
"At least you could hear
the voice of my heart!"

788
00:59:49,061 --> 00:59:56,467
"At least you could hear
the voice of my heart!"

789
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,303
Beware!

790
01:02:02,694 --> 01:02:04,286
Inspector!

791
01:02:10,936 --> 01:02:16,397
Here's a love letter
for you from the law!

792
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:19,970
A message to signal
Hariya's departure!

793
01:02:20,579 --> 01:02:22,444
These are Hariya's bail papers!

794
01:02:22,881 --> 01:02:24,280
Open the door!

795
01:02:30,322 --> 01:02:32,916
Read it carefully
through and through!

796
01:02:34,793 --> 01:02:36,260
Let Hariya go!

797
01:02:36,361 --> 01:02:40,263
Hey Inspector! You know very well...

798
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:44,995
...that i was wedded to
the cops for 7 years!

799
01:02:46,538 --> 01:02:48,369
Now i have divorced them!

800
01:02:49,575 --> 01:02:51,304
It is the custom of our village!

801
01:02:52,511 --> 01:02:55,002
One doesn't visit the in
laws home after the divorce!

802
01:02:56,315 --> 01:02:58,340
And listen to this as well!

803
01:02:59,551 --> 01:03:02,281
If any man from my entourage
spends a single night here...

804
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:06,016
... then you shan't see the
morning sun, the next day!

805
01:03:10,529 --> 01:03:12,326
Do you have a
license for this revolver?

806
01:03:13,532 --> 01:03:15,727
It is a genuine,
state assigned license!

807
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,599
And i am not such a fool,
that in this police station...

808
01:03:19,705 --> 01:03:21,332
Can i see the revolver?

809
01:03:44,363 --> 01:03:46,354
Six bullets were fired!

810
01:03:46,765 --> 01:03:48,357
From your revolver!

811
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:51,763
The fingerprints on it are yours!

812
01:03:52,771 --> 01:03:58,471
The case? Attempt to kill a
police officer in the station!

813
01:03:58,977 --> 01:04:00,410
Eye witnesses are present!

814
01:04:01,847 --> 01:04:04,577
Patil, what transpired here?

815
01:04:04,883 --> 01:04:06,316
Exactly what you said, Sir!

816
01:04:06,418 --> 01:04:08,943
- Kamble! - Yes Sir?
- What did you see?

817
01:04:09,054 --> 01:04:10,316
You were shot at, Sir!

818
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:13,514
- And you Inspector?- He
made an attempt to kill you!

819
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,320
Did you hear that?

820
01:04:17,462 --> 01:04:20,295
If i misuse the law,
the way you do...

821
01:04:20,399 --> 01:04:24,995
...you'll spend the rest of your
days doing hard labour in jail!

822
01:04:26,371 --> 01:04:28,339
And the hard labour will never end!

823
01:04:29,441 --> 01:04:31,932
The next time, you
butt into my work...

824
01:04:32,611 --> 01:04:35,011
I'll empty this
revolver into your chest!

825
01:04:35,781 --> 01:04:38,579
Then i shall interrogate
your corpse!

826
01:04:41,086 --> 01:04:45,682
And you know Daata,
corpses don't get out on bail!

827
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,351
Patil,
- Yes sir.

828
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:53,327
If they don't leave by
the count of three...

829
01:04:53,432 --> 01:04:56,526
...then throw the
punks into the jail!

830
01:05:20,058 --> 01:05:21,589
How come you both
are together today?

831
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:24,561
She was coming here, as you
had promised her something!

832
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,328
And i had promised
you something as well!

833
01:05:27,766 --> 01:05:30,496
So i thought, why not
fulfill both the promises together?

834
01:05:30,936 --> 01:05:33,564
So you fulfill your promise first!
- I am doing the same.

835
01:05:34,439 --> 01:05:37,306
Nisha, this is the file
with Daata's picture...

836
01:05:37,409 --> 01:05:39,969
...and details of all his
dealings, big & small!

837
01:05:40,912 --> 01:05:44,507
And this is the file because of
which, he spent 7 years in jail!

838
01:05:45,751 --> 01:05:48,311
Nisha, by reading
about Daata in the papers...

839
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:50,888
...i am sure, we'll win the case!

840
01:05:51,056 --> 01:05:53,320
We need public support!
Wait and watch Vijay...

841
01:05:53,425 --> 01:05:57,054
...tomorrow, Daata's
picture will be in the papers!

842
01:05:57,429 --> 01:06:01,866
Wonderful! You fulfilled
your promise, so well!

843
01:06:02,868 --> 01:06:06,998
But i have fulfilled my promise,
with great finesse, too!!

844
01:06:07,439 --> 01:06:09,373
- Which promise?
- Have you forgotten, Vijay?

845
01:06:09,474 --> 01:06:11,305
My first meeting with Nisha!

846
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:14,877
You must remember, Nisha!
The hotel, the hotel parking!

847
01:06:15,414 --> 01:06:17,609
When you had come to frisk me!

848
01:06:17,716 --> 01:06:19,479
And what had you done?

849
01:06:22,921 --> 01:06:24,145
Do you recall anything, Vijay?

850
01:06:24,823 --> 01:06:26,217
The promise, i had made to you?

851
01:06:26,725 --> 01:06:29,819
Ask her. So, Nisha,
you love me, don't you?

852
01:06:29,928 --> 01:06:31,828
What are you talking about?

853
01:06:31,930 --> 01:06:33,591
Talking about love in
the police station?

854
01:06:33,932 --> 01:06:36,696
Nisha, can you stay
without me for even a moment?

855
01:06:37,836 --> 01:06:40,361
I can't. You know about yourself!

856
01:06:41,406 --> 01:06:44,967
And if i don't meet you for a
day, your heart beats faster?

857
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:46,843
What kind of a joke is this, Ajay?

858
01:06:48,947 --> 01:06:52,383
This isn't the joke! the joke
is my so called love for you!

859
01:06:52,951 --> 01:06:55,385
What do you think,
that i really love you?

860
01:06:55,854 --> 01:06:57,947
Look Vijay, i have kept my promise!

861
01:06:58,857 --> 01:07:02,384
See how pale she has gone,
on hearing the truth!

862
01:07:02,694 --> 01:07:04,628
What's wrong with you?
Why are you talking crap?

863
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,753
Forget it man!

864
01:07:06,498 --> 01:07:08,131
I haven't hung
around a girl for so long!

865
01:07:08,633 --> 01:07:11,659
My promise is done!
Let us go our own way!

866
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:14,337
Ajay, tell me this is a lie!

867
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:16,669
See she's even crying now!

868
01:07:17,809 --> 01:07:21,802
- Ajay...- That day, you
slapped me so smartly!

869
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:25,414
Today, i slapped you,
and you can't even see it!

870
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:27,447
You can hear it, can't you?

871
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:30,018
Ajay! Nisha!

872
01:07:30,322 --> 01:07:34,554
Let her go! I don't
give a damn about her!

873
01:07:34,726 --> 01:07:38,753
If i stay stuck to one girl,
what about the rest?

874
01:08:17,702 --> 01:08:23,937
"I dreamt dreams, i made you mine!"

875
01:08:24,376 --> 01:08:30,542
"And you betrayed me!"

876
01:08:30,649 --> 01:08:36,485
"How can i say, that my...

877
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:42,491
...dream have betrayed me!"

878
01:08:44,596 --> 01:08:47,827
"I dreamt dreams!"

879
01:09:26,438 --> 01:09:34,868
"I had asked for the joys of love!"

880
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:40,919
"I have only received
shame and heartbreak!"

881
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:48,421
The heart got sorrow,
the eyes received tears!"

882
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:53,495
"I found only loneliness!"

883
01:09:55,467 --> 01:10:06,639
"That unfaithful man,
rewarded me well for my faith!"

884
01:10:08,613 --> 01:10:15,314
"I dreamt dreams, i made you mine!"

885
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:19,989
"And you have betrayed me!"

886
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,625
"I dreamt dreams!"

887
01:11:06,471 --> 01:11:12,706
"I have no grudges against anyone!"

888
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:18,977
"I have no complaints."

889
01:11:19,617 --> 01:11:22,518
'Why am i still alive...

890
01:11:22,887 --> 01:11:31,317
...when i have no wish to live?"

891
01:11:32,964 --> 01:11:35,933
"My heart is sinking...

892
01:11:36,634 --> 01:11:39,762
...why do i feel this heartache?"

893
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:45,468
"Why the light of my life waning?

894
01:11:46,644 --> 01:11:52,947
"I dreamt dreams, and made you mine!"

895
01:11:53,718 --> 01:11:57,916
"You betrayed me!"

896
01:12:00,458 --> 01:12:03,018
"How can i say it?"

897
01:12:03,728 --> 01:12:11,965
"My dreams have betrayed me!"

898
01:12:13,671 --> 01:12:16,765
"I dreamt dreams!"

899
01:12:47,372 --> 01:12:50,864
Big people bow down
to my slightest will!

900
01:12:50,975 --> 01:12:53,341
Daata!

901
01:12:53,444 --> 01:12:56,470
Everyone respects me!
And this chit of a girl...

902
01:12:56,581 --> 01:12:59,607
...has turned my reputation into
a chutney for public consumption.

903
01:12:59,717 --> 01:13:04,484
And you punks! Hey Hariya!
Hear this loud and clear!

904
01:13:04,722 --> 01:13:08,886
If my picture is printed,
i will riun your mugs!

905
01:13:09,994 --> 01:13:13,361
The chit of a girl, shouldn't
be able to put pen to paper!

906
01:13:13,731 --> 01:13:15,426
Stop all her reading and writing.

907
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:18,801
Bring her here, i
shall give her a degree!

908
01:13:41,826 --> 01:13:43,384
Hey Hariya!- Your command, Daata!

909
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:48,899
Cutting grass and picking
flowers are not the same thing!

910
01:13:50,869 --> 01:13:54,396
Her fingers & mouth
may work non stop!

911
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:58,602
But i can tell you without
touching her, i can tell you...

912
01:13:59,878 --> 01:14:02,073
...the body beneath those clothes...

913
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:05,673
...is really delicate!

914
01:14:05,851 --> 01:14:07,879
You're finally at your
real level aren't you Daata?

915
01:14:07,919 --> 01:14:12,788
- If you are a man...
- The doctor says i am a man!

916
01:14:14,726 --> 01:14:16,694
I have brought you
here to test that fact!

917
01:14:16,928 --> 01:14:18,862
Daata, if my honour...

918
01:14:18,963 --> 01:14:21,431
What about you
playing with my honour?

919
01:14:22,533 --> 01:14:24,501
I have read the
love letter about me...

920
01:14:24,602 --> 01:14:27,036
...which you'd printed in the papers!

921
01:14:27,939 --> 01:14:32,035
You stripped me
naked before the public!

922
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:35,039
I will play the same game with you!

923
01:14:36,014 --> 01:14:41,042
I'll strip you and see
the honour you hide within!

924
01:14:41,753 --> 01:14:43,778
I will show everyone! Hey Hariya!

925
01:14:44,622 --> 01:14:45,646
Take her sari off!

926
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:54,722
No!

927
01:14:56,701 --> 01:14:59,465
No, Hariya!

928
01:15:02,573 --> 01:15:06,942
No... Hariya.

929
01:15:07,645 --> 01:15:12,412
I swear on your mother! She gave
birth to you & your sister too!

930
01:15:12,517 --> 01:15:15,884
The one you make your wife,
will be a woman too!

931
01:15:15,987 --> 01:15:17,645
Your daughter will
mention her as mother.

932
01:15:17,655 --> 01:15:19,816
No Hariya. Hariya.

933
01:15:20,725 --> 01:15:23,626
After behaving this way with me,
can you meet your mother's eyes?

934
01:15:23,928 --> 01:15:29,889
Hariya's eyes see only one
image that of his Daata!

935
01:15:30,835 --> 01:15:32,894
I am the only one he can see!

936
01:15:34,339 --> 01:15:38,503
No one besides me!
He was 4 years old!

937
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,007
Since than i have
had him! He is my pet!

938
01:15:41,612 --> 01:15:43,671
His ears understand my language!

939
01:15:44,615 --> 01:15:46,640
His tongue licks my heel!

940
01:15:47,618 --> 01:15:48,983
You want to print my photo?

941
01:15:50,355 --> 01:15:52,880
I will expose you instead!

942
01:15:53,758 --> 01:15:55,885
Pull it, Hariya! Go on, pull it!

943
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,333
If your wrist does not
understand this bond...

944
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,126
...then i'll explain
it's meaning to you!

945
01:16:08,573 --> 01:16:10,541
This string is called a Rakhi!

946
01:16:10,808 --> 01:16:14,608
And you know, why a
sister ties it to a brother!

947
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:18,813
After getting related to you,
i shall strip the sari myself!

948
01:16:18,916 --> 01:16:20,806
And i will surrender
myself to this bastard.

949
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:25,812
But Hariya, the one
who will be seen here...

950
01:16:26,524 --> 01:16:27,784
...won't be an orphaned child!

951
01:16:27,792 --> 01:16:32,525
It will be your own sister!

952
01:16:53,351 --> 01:16:56,650
Hariya, what is this you have done?

953
01:16:56,754 --> 01:16:57,778
Tell me!

954
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:03,623
Were did you get this
kind of courage from?

955
01:17:05,797 --> 01:17:07,697
That you dared to
put her sari back on?

956
01:17:08,366 --> 01:17:09,458
Against my wishes!

957
01:17:13,971 --> 01:17:16,405
Let her go, Daata!

958
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:22,579
What she has tied on
to my wrist after that...

959
01:17:23,981 --> 01:17:25,972
...my soul is looking down on me!

960
01:17:27,919 --> 01:17:30,410
Daata, beat me as much
as you want, cut me up!

961
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:31,647
I won't say a word!

962
01:17:33,391 --> 01:17:34,551
But let her go, Daata!

963
01:17:39,397 --> 01:17:41,957
She made you her brother
with the help of a rag!

964
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:46,733
But if it were really your sister...

965
01:17:47,672 --> 01:17:53,577
...and i wanted her, then would
you worry about me, or yourself?

966
01:17:53,678 --> 01:17:54,702
Daata!

967
01:17:57,682 --> 01:18:02,710
Hariya, since when does
your neck have the strength...

968
01:18:03,955 --> 01:18:05,786
...to raise your eyes to mine!

969
01:18:07,558 --> 01:18:14,589
I swear, i used to bend my
head out of respect for you!

970
01:18:15,700 --> 01:18:17,861
Don't think of it as my weakness!

971
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:21,700
If my real form comes before you...

972
01:18:22,807 --> 01:18:26,903
...then your head will be
cut off your shoulders!

973
01:18:27,645 --> 01:18:31,581
I will flay you alive and
see your real form too, Hariya!

974
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:35,010
And i will look at leisure!

975
01:18:36,654 --> 01:18:38,679
First, let me respect your sister!

976
01:18:39,657 --> 01:18:43,024
Then i shall see, which of
your real forms can stop me!

977
01:18:47,398 --> 01:18:49,628
Don't put your
hands in such a place...

978
01:18:50,735 --> 01:18:53,033
...that you lose your hands!

979
01:18:54,672 --> 01:18:58,039
Wherever you go, you
will be hailed as a cripple!

980
01:18:58,843 --> 01:19:01,641
And if someone asks you,
who uprooted your arms...

981
01:19:02,947 --> 01:19:04,881
...feel embarrassed to take my name!

982
01:19:06,684 --> 01:19:11,451
There will be two holes in your
shoulders, instead of these arms.

983
01:19:13,491 --> 01:19:18,451
And the reason for
this is my sister!

984
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:24,699
Enough of this bond of Rakhi!
Pathan, tie Hariya up there!

985
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,827
And fetch his sister to me!

986
01:19:28,506 --> 01:19:32,602
Today i will strip
Hariya's sister before him!

987
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:36,339
Then the festival of
Rakhi will be done!

988
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:39,473
Go on! Hit him and break his neck!

989
01:19:39,584 --> 01:19:40,846
Hit him in the head.

990
01:19:45,957 --> 01:19:47,356
Hit him in the head.

991
01:20:38,442 --> 01:20:41,343
Daata there are only two
syllables in your name.

992
01:20:42,647 --> 01:20:44,808
Daa and Ta!

993
01:20:46,450 --> 01:20:50,546
I have been the
power in each of them!

994
01:20:51,656 --> 01:20:54,955
Your made me lick
your heels! I licked!

995
01:20:56,761 --> 01:20:58,786
I danced to every whim of yours!

996
01:20:58,896 --> 01:21:01,956
But understand this! I am not a dog!

997
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:05,433
I am the lion that you raised!

998
01:21:06,871 --> 01:21:08,964
You love raising lions,
don't you, Daata?

999
01:21:09,874 --> 01:21:11,637
But remember this thing!

1000
01:21:12,743 --> 01:21:14,904
You can never ride a lion!

1001
01:21:16,614 --> 01:21:19,515
When it's paw is raised, you
don't try to test it's sharpness.

1002
01:21:21,552 --> 01:21:27,787
Daata, you were armed & you
thought you are a lion slayer?

1003
01:21:28,793 --> 01:21:33,526
If i want, i can snatch
the life from your body...

1004
01:21:33,631 --> 01:21:35,997
...and leave the hollow skin behind!

1005
01:21:37,501 --> 01:21:38,798
But i won't do that, Daata!

1006
01:21:39,704 --> 01:21:45,336
I won't do that, because,
today i earned a relationship!

1007
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:47,607
And for the sake of
that relationship...

1008
01:21:48,646 --> 01:21:51,638
... i give you the gift of life!

1009
01:21:51,749 --> 01:21:53,011
Go!

1010
01:22:00,825 --> 01:22:03,623
The cliff named Daata has
lost it's armour called Hariya!

1011
01:22:04,762 --> 01:22:07,663
We tried so hard to
crush that cliff to mud!

1012
01:22:08,766 --> 01:22:15,296
Hariya is gone! Now, i
shall end Daata's story!

1013
01:22:16,774 --> 01:22:18,799
Ajay i know you as well as her!

1014
01:22:19,677 --> 01:22:22,407
You are such low down scum!
You don't deserve her!

1015
01:22:22,613 --> 01:22:24,979
You didn't say a word,
when she slapped me!

1016
01:22:25,616 --> 01:22:27,743
That day you were wrong,
and so is the case today!

1017
01:22:28,686 --> 01:22:30,183
She was swayed by you for no reason!

1018
01:22:30,287 --> 01:22:34,451
Ajay, that girl was swayed by you...

1019
01:22:34,558 --> 01:22:36,617
...as she has no one in this world!

1020
01:22:37,728 --> 01:22:41,596
Maybe she found love for the 1st
time & squandered her emotions!

1021
01:22:41,966 --> 01:22:44,500
Being without support, if she
does something to harm herself...

1022
01:22:44,502 --> 01:22:47,528
...you won't forgive
yourself for life!

1023
01:22:50,508 --> 01:22:51,941
Sister!
- Nisha!

1024
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,478
Nisha! Don't cry. What happened?

1025
01:22:54,578 --> 01:22:56,603
- What is it? - What happened,
Nisha? - Tell us!

1026
01:22:56,714 --> 01:22:58,011
What is it Nisha!

1027
01:23:01,385 --> 01:23:03,012
What are you doing here, punk?

1028
01:23:03,254 --> 01:23:04,812
Who permitted you
to enter this house?

1029
01:23:04,822 --> 01:23:07,017
Brother, Hariya has come with me!

1030
01:23:08,459 --> 01:23:10,484
If he leaves, i go too!

1031
01:23:10,828 --> 01:23:12,921
- He is a criminal!
- He is my brother, Vijay!

1032
01:23:14,732 --> 01:23:18,498
If he weren't there, you
would have heard of my ruin...

1033
01:23:19,837 --> 01:23:21,998
...or found my copse on a road!

1034
01:23:23,607 --> 01:23:25,802
Daata's people abducted me!

1035
01:23:26,544 --> 01:23:29,035
In that pack of animals,
there was only one human being!

1036
01:23:29,346 --> 01:23:32,372
It was him! He saved me!

1037
01:23:32,984 --> 01:23:34,676
Now those people are
not just after me...

1038
01:23:34,685 --> 01:23:36,585
...they are after his life too!

1039
01:23:42,493 --> 01:23:43,517
Brother!

1040
01:24:17,828 --> 01:24:19,887
No! - Nisha! - Nisha!

1041
01:24:20,664 --> 01:24:26,830
Nisha!

1042
01:25:18,455 --> 01:25:19,922
Doctor, will she be all right?

1043
01:25:20,457 --> 01:25:22,482
Nothing is certain,
she lost a lot of blood!

1044
01:25:57,901 --> 01:25:59,562
Doctor...
- Now she is out of danger!

1045
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:02,901
Thank you doctor. Thank you.

1046
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:15,441
If you have any pride left,
don't ever try to meet Nisha!

1047
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,521
Please forgive me, pal!

1048
01:26:20,691 --> 01:26:23,057
I can't face myself!

1049
01:26:23,427 --> 01:26:25,827
It's such a pity...

1050
01:26:26,764 --> 01:26:30,393
...whatever you just said
doesn't have much truth in it!

1051
01:26:31,502 --> 01:26:34,835
But i am so used to your lies,
everything you say seems a lie!

1052
01:26:34,938 --> 01:26:39,534
No, punish me anyway you want!

1053
01:26:39,710 --> 01:26:45,410
But forgive me! Im
beginning to hate myself!

1054
01:26:45,983 --> 01:26:50,010
I loathe myself! I am not
worthy of your friendship....

1055
01:26:51,588 --> 01:26:53,485
..and neither am i
worthy of Nisha's love!

1056
01:26:54,525 --> 01:26:59,553
I now understand what love means!

1057
01:27:10,607 --> 01:27:13,371
Nisha, this young
man looks the same...

1058
01:27:13,477 --> 01:27:14,701
...but thinks differently!

1059
01:27:41,972 --> 01:27:43,530
Nisha! - Ajay!

1060
01:27:44,708 --> 01:27:47,472
I was a liar and a rogue!

1061
01:27:48,579 --> 01:27:50,945
You are very superior and...

1062
01:27:51,448 --> 01:27:54,076
Hey Devdas! Are you in love,
or measuring character?

1063
01:27:55,986 --> 01:28:00,923
I'll get going! Take the
matter forward, after i leave!

1064
01:28:01,725 --> 01:28:03,022
Come on!

1065
01:28:15,939 --> 01:28:17,566
This is Hariya, arrest him!

1066
01:28:17,674 --> 01:28:19,505
Why arrest Hariya?

1067
01:28:19,610 --> 01:28:20,907
This is Mr. Choughule's order!

1068
01:28:21,345 --> 01:28:22,835
- What is his crime?
- Daata's murder!

1069
01:28:23,347 --> 01:28:25,941
Daata was killed? When?

1070
01:28:26,049 --> 01:28:28,745
I see, you have already
forgotten when you killed him?

1071
01:28:29,419 --> 01:28:30,647
This is a lie, Inspector!

1072
01:28:31,355 --> 01:28:33,448
That will be proved in
the court! Arrest him!

1073
01:28:33,557 --> 01:28:34,819
One minute.

1074
01:28:34,925 --> 01:28:36,392
Inspector you can't... - No Vijay!

1075
01:28:36,493 --> 01:28:37,790
Let them take me!

1076
01:28:38,896 --> 01:28:40,989
Or else the matter will go
out of hand and go higher!

1077
01:28:41,431 --> 01:28:43,692
When i haven't committed the
murder, what can they prove?

1078
01:28:43,700 --> 01:28:44,758
Come along! - Let's go!

1079
01:28:53,443 --> 01:28:58,073
ACP Choughule! May i ask, for
what crime you arrested Hariya?

1080
01:28:58,649 --> 01:29:02,483
Didn't you read the papers? He
murdered his Daata yesterday!

1081
01:29:02,586 --> 01:29:05,214
What time did the murder
take place, yesterday?

1082
01:29:05,222 --> 01:29:07,016
Yesterday afternoon
between 3 and 4 o'clock!

1083
01:29:07,024 --> 01:29:11,688
Yesterday, at that time,
Hariya was at my house with me!

1084
01:29:11,795 --> 01:29:13,660
He was present at your house?

1085
01:29:14,731 --> 01:29:16,722
Tomorrow, you will
say he was with me?

1086
01:29:17,601 --> 01:29:18,625
That's an approximation!

1087
01:29:19,603 --> 01:29:22,936
Inspector Vijay, the law
doesn't work like that!

1088
01:29:23,540 --> 01:29:26,566
I have a steadfast witness,
who was present there himself!

1089
01:29:27,945 --> 01:29:29,037
ACP Ashwin Kumar!

1090
01:29:30,414 --> 01:29:33,042
ACP Ashwin Kumar? That means,
your brother was there too?

1091
01:29:33,850 --> 01:29:34,908
And Hariya was there too?

1092
01:29:35,686 --> 01:29:37,654
Fine, i'll phone him, right away!

1093
01:29:38,422 --> 01:29:41,789
If this is true,
we'll release Hariya!

1094
01:29:44,494 --> 01:29:47,827
ACP Ashwin Kumar? - Speaking!

1095
01:29:47,931 --> 01:29:49,455
This is ACP Choughule.

1096
01:29:49,566 --> 01:29:50,590
Yes, tell me Choughule.

1097
01:29:51,435 --> 01:29:55,462
Inspector Vijay is stating, he
was with you between 3 and 4 pm!

1098
01:29:55,572 --> 01:29:56,732
When Daata was murdered!

1099
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:01,470
Hariya? The statement is baseless!

1100
01:30:01,878 --> 01:30:03,607
Hariya never came to our house.

1101
01:30:03,981 --> 01:30:05,949
Inspector Vijay's
memory is failing him!

1102
01:30:06,516 --> 01:30:07,813
He must have his own reasons!

1103
01:30:11,422 --> 01:30:13,016
So i should keep
Hariya in jail, right?

1104
01:30:13,023 --> 01:30:14,820
Keep him in jail...

1105
01:30:15,525 --> 01:30:19,552
...and don't allow him out on
bail under any circumstances!

1106
01:30:20,931 --> 01:30:24,799
All right, ACP Sir. I'll
prepare non boilable papers!

1107
01:30:25,736 --> 01:30:27,670
Brother, Hariya was with
us yesterday afternoon!

1108
01:30:28,538 --> 01:30:31,564
Inspector Vijay, you are
talking to ACP Ashwini Kumar!

1109
01:30:31,675 --> 01:30:32,699
Not your brother!

1110
01:30:33,677 --> 01:30:36,510
If you wish to vouch for
hardened criminals, do so!

1111
01:30:36,613 --> 01:30:38,046
But i won't get into that mess!

1112
01:30:44,855 --> 01:30:49,656
You are trying to free the
criminal whom you had booked?

1113
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:53,762
And your revered
brother is stopping his bail!

1114
01:30:55,632 --> 01:30:56,963
I don't quite get this!

1115
01:31:05,709 --> 01:31:09,577
- Sister, who's come
home? - Nobody! Why?

1116
01:31:10,814 --> 01:31:12,038
Whose car is that outside?

1117
01:31:12,382 --> 01:31:14,407
Your brother has taken a
new car! Nice, isn't it?

1118
01:31:14,918 --> 01:31:16,943
Why don't you go for a spin?

1119
01:31:19,523 --> 01:31:22,651
I can't walk Brother's walk.

1120
01:31:23,827 --> 01:31:26,887
He's welcome to the
car and the demeanour!

1121
01:31:27,831 --> 01:31:29,057
Why are you talking so meanly?

1122
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:30,957
What's the matter with you?

1123
01:31:30,967 --> 01:31:33,868
Nothing's happened to me!
Something's happened to Brother!

1124
01:31:35,706 --> 01:31:37,330
Where did this car
come from, anyway?

1125
01:31:37,341 --> 01:31:39,366
Why? He took some Ioan!

1126
01:31:39,476 --> 01:31:42,570
This hire purchase schemes,
buying things on Ioan...

1127
01:31:42,679 --> 01:31:46,376
...since when has Brother
been interested in this?

1128
01:31:46,950 --> 01:31:49,817
What are you trying to say?

1129
01:31:50,854 --> 01:31:54,449
Brother has sold his
soul to criminals...

1130
01:31:54,558 --> 01:31:56,389
...and earned money in return!

1131
01:31:56,860 --> 01:31:58,953
That is the true name
of this hire purchase!

1132
01:31:59,363 --> 01:32:05,324
These Ioans, installments,
or shall we say, that K.K!

1133
01:32:06,370 --> 01:32:08,770
Under whose patronage all
crimes take place in this city!

1134
01:32:09,873 --> 01:32:12,341
He has bought ACP Ashwin Kumar!

1135
01:32:13,910 --> 01:32:14,934
My brother sold himself!

1136
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:18,846
He entered the market and
turned into merchandise!

1137
01:32:20,784 --> 01:32:24,811
You are saying all
this about your brother?

1138
01:32:26,456 --> 01:32:31,416
Vijay, where are your
values? Your manners!

1139
01:32:31,528 --> 01:32:35,794
How long do i wear the
blindfold of manners and values?

1140
01:32:38,835 --> 01:32:40,359
Brother's salary is the same.

1141
01:32:41,671 --> 01:32:44,504
But this house has an air,
which surpasses it.

1142
01:32:44,674 --> 01:32:47,342
A government salary does not
give the shine this house possesses!

1143
01:32:47,844 --> 01:32:54,545
He's telling lies, and
earning the wages of sin!

1144
01:32:54,651 --> 01:32:57,044
You are saying the first
thing that comes to your mind!

1145
01:32:57,854 --> 01:33:02,450
Are you so worthy that you
can suspect your elder brother?

1146
01:33:02,559 --> 01:33:05,050
I suspected it earlier,
but now i am sure of it!

1147
01:33:05,695 --> 01:33:09,392
Shut your beliefs with your
room door and stay here in peace!

1148
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:14,466
If you say a word against your
brother before me, Vijay, i....

1149
01:33:14,571 --> 01:33:17,062
Stuffing your ears with cotton
can't drown the sound of truth!

1150
01:33:17,974 --> 01:33:21,933
I used to boast of
Brother's honesty loudly...

1151
01:33:22,646 --> 01:33:25,410
...now i can declare his corruption,
even more loudly!

1152
01:33:26,716 --> 01:33:33,918
I have felt this
fact with my own hands!

1153
01:33:34,891 --> 01:33:38,554
Wonderful, nice to see a
brother & sister in law arguing!

1154
01:33:39,896 --> 01:33:42,797
This is the first time, i've
heard you both sing so loudly!

1155
01:33:43,800 --> 01:33:44,824
What's the matter?

1156
01:33:44,935 --> 01:33:46,630
Ask your brother!

1157
01:33:48,071 --> 01:33:50,096
I can't believe this
is the same brother...

1158
01:33:50,907 --> 01:33:53,501
...who is dragging your
reputation in the muck!

1159
01:33:53,610 --> 01:33:55,578
Where does the muck
come in, without the rain?

1160
01:33:57,681 --> 01:33:58,905
What's the matter, brother?

1161
01:34:01,918 --> 01:34:03,942
Your attitude has changed,
quite a bit brother!

1162
01:34:04,688 --> 01:34:09,990
Your hobbies have changed! Your
interest in people & humanity...

1163
01:34:10,961 --> 01:34:13,054
...is now focused towards shiny cars!

1164
01:34:14,865 --> 01:34:16,662
First, i suspected your friends.

1165
01:34:17,868 --> 01:34:18,892
But now, i am sure of it!

1166
01:34:20,036 --> 01:34:25,406
Tell me, brother, isn't K.K the
one who wanted Hariya in jail?

1167
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:27,938
May i offer you some advice, Vijay?

1168
01:34:28,778 --> 01:34:31,804
Don't drag K.K between us!

1169
01:34:33,583 --> 01:34:36,609
That's it, brother!
That's all i need to hear!

1170
01:34:39,656 --> 01:34:42,784
Now the question is if
the food cooked at home...

1171
01:34:43,727 --> 01:34:48,630
...every morsel of food is
paid by your official salary...

1172
01:34:49,533 --> 01:34:50,825
...or by K.K's wages of sin!

1173
01:34:51,067 --> 01:34:54,503
Leave this house, don't
have anything to do with it...

1174
01:34:54,604 --> 01:34:56,435
...if it hurts so much!

1175
01:34:56,540 --> 01:34:58,508
Then break all your
relations with us.

1176
01:35:00,010 --> 01:35:05,812
Now, your brother has to
justify himself to you?

1177
01:35:07,484 --> 01:35:13,582
It's better, Vijay, understand
it do the best of your ability!

1178
01:35:13,857 --> 01:35:17,384
Jyoti! Don't you interfere!

1179
01:35:18,695 --> 01:35:20,360
This is an argument
between two brother!

1180
01:35:20,697 --> 01:35:23,461
If it's between two
brothers and i am not concerned...

1181
01:35:23,567 --> 01:35:24,591
...then go out and argue!

1182
01:35:25,869 --> 01:35:29,532
If someone says anything
against my husband in this house...

1183
01:35:29,639 --> 01:35:31,664
...i won't be able to bear it!

1184
01:35:33,777 --> 01:35:35,074
Then it could be anyone!

1185
01:35:35,378 --> 01:35:41,476
That's enough! Vijay, don't
feel hurt by your sister's words!

1186
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:48,783
Feel bad about what sister said?
Brother, she is my mother!

1187
01:35:49,593 --> 01:35:53,893
She has said
something that is very good!

1188
01:35:55,999 --> 01:36:00,493
She has so much faith
in you! But brother...

1189
01:36:01,605 --> 01:36:03,505
...i don't have any faith in you!

1190
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:07,567
I can't live in this house!

1191
01:36:08,678 --> 01:36:09,902
I can't live in this house!

1192
01:36:11,681 --> 01:36:12,705
Vijay! - Let him go!

1193
01:36:13,817 --> 01:36:16,445
Living with someone, with
so much hate deep within...

1194
01:36:16,553 --> 01:36:17,884
...is a sin according to me!

1195
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:21,521
Please go to the
kitchen and do your work!

1196
01:36:29,032 --> 01:36:30,056
Can i talk to Ashwin?

1197
01:36:30,367 --> 01:36:31,595
Who is this? - K.K.

1198
01:36:36,873 --> 01:36:38,670
K.K has called for you. - What?

1199
01:36:43,913 --> 01:36:45,171
Go inside and do your work!

1200
01:36:48,985 --> 01:36:50,009
Tell me, K.K!

1201
01:36:50,387 --> 01:36:52,981
Ashwin, you were going to tell
me about the evening's plans!

1202
01:36:53,089 --> 01:36:54,852
Yes, there was something at home...

1203
01:36:55,959 --> 01:36:57,551
...Vijay got angry
and left the house!

1204
01:36:57,661 --> 01:37:01,427
- Why? - Probably
after seeing the new car!

1205
01:37:01,731 --> 01:37:04,427
This is the
beginning of our romance!

1206
01:37:04,668 --> 01:37:06,966
If he can't digest this progress...

1207
01:37:07,437 --> 01:37:09,734
...latter, there will be so
much progress in your life!

1208
01:37:09,739 --> 01:37:11,431
He won't be able to
digest any of that!

1209
01:37:13,677 --> 01:37:15,508
Anyway, Ashwin, let
the one who left, go!

1210
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:21,674
Ashwin, if you and i stay together...

1211
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:26,514
...then there will be coins with
our names on them in this city!

1212
01:37:27,857 --> 01:37:28,983
We will buy the entire city!

1213
01:37:32,562 --> 01:37:34,996
Vijay, look who's here?

1214
01:37:39,203 --> 01:37:40,827
I'd told you that
sister would surely...

1215
01:37:40,837 --> 01:37:47,072
I see! There was a wager whether i
could stay away, on this day?

1216
01:37:50,714 --> 01:37:53,080
Vijay, you couldn't even call once?

1217
01:37:54,584 --> 01:37:56,484
If not us,you could
have spoken to Chinky!

1218
01:37:56,586 --> 01:37:57,610
No sister!

1219
01:37:57,887 --> 01:37:59,111
You're totally wrong there!

1220
01:37:59,589 --> 01:38:02,683
Even if you had not come there,
this guy would've come there!

1221
01:38:02,792 --> 01:38:05,153
He's been collecting presents
for Chinky for the past week!

1222
01:38:06,463 --> 01:38:07,953
That's the faith
that brought me here!

1223
01:38:08,598 --> 01:38:11,362
If relationships break
over the smallest things...

1224
01:38:11,668 --> 01:38:14,660
... then there would be so many
different worlds under one roof!

1225
01:38:15,772 --> 01:38:17,967
Sister, how is Chinky?

1226
01:38:19,743 --> 01:38:22,678
She still gets up once in the
night to look into your room!

1227
01:38:23,546 --> 01:38:24,770
Hoping that you have come!

1228
01:38:26,683 --> 01:38:28,048
Won't you ask about your brother?

1229
01:38:29,753 --> 01:38:34,747
I'll meet him in the evening.
Tell Chinky i'm coming home.

1230
01:38:35,425 --> 01:38:37,115
The party is not at home,
it's at a hotel.

1231
01:38:38,862 --> 01:38:39,886
Holiday Inn!

1232
01:38:41,765 --> 01:38:44,791
Sister, brother is
really progressing!

1233
01:38:49,973 --> 01:38:51,265
Yes, you are absolutely right.

1234
01:38:51,975 --> 01:38:53,670
Yes, right!

1235
01:38:55,578 --> 01:38:57,739
Come Jyoti! Meet K.K!

1236
01:38:58,448 --> 01:38:59,813
And this is my better half!

1237
01:39:00,717 --> 01:39:04,949
Mr. Ashwin, if my
wife were so beautiful...

1238
01:39:06,723 --> 01:39:08,623
...i would suspect my friends too!

1239
01:39:10,393 --> 01:39:12,292
Good knows, how many
murderes i would commit!

1240
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:17,960
K.K, i was so involved in
the warp and weft of life...

1241
01:39:18,835 --> 01:39:21,497
...i didn't pay much
attention to beauty!

1242
01:39:22,605 --> 01:39:26,632
Now, imagine this! I was born in
India but never saw Taj Mahal!

1243
01:39:27,744 --> 01:39:30,713
Because, i hope to build
a Taj Mahal of my own!

1244
01:39:31,414 --> 01:39:34,577
I would've written Taj Mahal in
the fate of this city long ago!

1245
01:39:36,486 --> 01:39:38,386
If i had been graced
with such a lovely wife!

1246
01:39:39,422 --> 01:39:41,447
Ashwin, just a minute!

1247
01:39:46,429 --> 01:39:48,693
At least don't ignore
the praise of an admirer!

1248
01:39:50,867 --> 01:39:54,394
The day you experience a
married woman's refusal, Mr. K.K...

1249
01:39:54,871 --> 01:39:56,930
...you will forget
your brand of praise!

1250
01:39:58,708 --> 01:40:01,802
Listen, explain to your friend!

1251
01:40:02,512 --> 01:40:04,004
He is crossing the
limits of decency!

1252
01:40:04,948 --> 01:40:05,972
He must be joking!

1253
01:40:06,516 --> 01:40:08,541
Jyoti, you take
everything too seriously!

1254
01:40:08,818 --> 01:40:10,979
Don't create a scene!

1255
01:40:11,321 --> 01:40:12,481
What were you saying?

1256
01:40:28,404 --> 01:40:31,965
Sister, brother now has a new hobby!

1257
01:40:33,743 --> 01:40:36,576
He worships animals,
now. You do one thing!

1258
01:40:37,847 --> 01:40:39,576
Keep a dog at home.

1259
01:40:40,850 --> 01:40:42,579
So that you learn
how to deal with dogs!

1260
01:40:43,486 --> 01:40:47,445
I can tell you how
to deal with animals!

1261
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,590
Your hands are getting
too long for your sleeves!

1262
01:40:53,763 --> 01:40:55,526
You raise them, when
you want on anyone!

1263
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:57,065
What about your friend's hands?

1264
01:40:57,867 --> 01:40:59,528
Don't take Vijay's
side all the time!

1265
01:41:00,870 --> 01:41:04,738
We both can't have blood of
the same colour in our veins!

1266
01:41:10,513 --> 01:41:12,572
Brother, i didn't
expect you to do this!

1267
01:41:23,826 --> 01:41:29,025
To deal with the eunuchs of
the city, few men may fall short!

1268
01:41:30,667 --> 01:41:32,498
But there are still
a few good men left!

1269
01:41:52,922 --> 01:41:54,612
Where are you going
early in the morning?

1270
01:41:54,624 --> 01:41:57,684
I am taking myself away
from this life and home!

1271
01:41:59,429 --> 01:42:00,653
You're leaving this house?

1272
01:42:00,863 --> 01:42:02,387
What has happened to you, suddenly?

1273
01:42:02,565 --> 01:42:08,470
Suddenly, the world
between these walls and roof...

1274
01:42:08,571 --> 01:42:10,471
...appears unknown to me!

1275
01:42:11,507 --> 01:42:14,908
Only your name appears familiar!

1276
01:42:16,813 --> 01:42:18,610
But even you seem a stranger!

1277
01:42:18,715 --> 01:42:20,740
But Jyoti, everything
is as it used to be!

1278
01:42:21,918 --> 01:42:24,478
I'm surprised, that
you still don't feel it!

1279
01:42:27,824 --> 01:42:31,555
I wish your behaviour at
the party was a bad dream!

1280
01:42:33,396 --> 01:42:34,420
Not reality!

1281
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:38,428
Jyoti, the man named K.K
is not an ordinary person!

1282
01:42:38,534 --> 01:42:39,558
He is a big man!

1283
01:42:39,836 --> 01:42:40,894
He has a reach...

1284
01:42:41,004 --> 01:42:44,371
If anyone dares to reach
for your wife's honour...

1285
01:42:44,474 --> 01:42:46,564
...then you are not worthy
of being called a husband!

1286
01:42:47,677 --> 01:42:50,840
Last night he misbehaved
with me in public!

1287
01:42:51,147 --> 01:42:52,909
Tomorrow he will
molest me in the public...

1288
01:42:52,915 --> 01:42:57,875
...then too, you won't get
angry nor will your arms be raised!

1289
01:42:58,554 --> 01:43:00,818
You will look on,
wearing your cloak of weakness!

1290
01:43:00,923 --> 01:43:07,522
- Jyoti! - Why didn't you
shout out, at that moment Ashwin?

1291
01:43:08,765 --> 01:43:10,995
Since when have you become so weak!

1292
01:43:12,869 --> 01:43:15,463
Your personality has been weakened...

1293
01:43:15,571 --> 01:43:17,835
...and your strength
has been purchased.

1294
01:43:20,443 --> 01:43:25,608
And now, i can't live, with
this weak & helpless Ashwin.

1295
01:43:26,783 --> 01:43:30,685
There can be circumstances,
which make a person weak!

1296
01:43:32,455 --> 01:43:33,479
I am not a deity!

1297
01:43:33,589 --> 01:43:35,750
But i had begun to
think you were one!

1298
01:43:38,661 --> 01:43:44,566
And today, every belief,
faith and respite is orphaned.

1299
01:43:46,736 --> 01:43:49,796
For the past & years if i
considered you right, Ashwin...

1300
01:43:51,541 --> 01:43:53,509
...you are someone else, now!

1301
01:43:53,609 --> 01:43:55,577
Who is wearing your
face and living with me!

1302
01:43:57,547 --> 01:43:58,639
But if i was wrong then...

1303
01:44:00,817 --> 01:44:03,513
...it's better to live separately
than to live with you.

1304
01:44:03,619 --> 01:44:04,847
Holding you in contempt!

1305
01:44:04,954 --> 01:44:09,584
Jyoti, you don't have permission
to leave the house this way!

1306
01:44:13,563 --> 01:44:16,760
You have lost the
right to stop me, Ashwin!

1307
01:44:18,868 --> 01:44:20,927
Relationships are not just names!

1308
01:44:23,873 --> 01:44:26,398
They have to be
maintained with great toil!

1309
01:44:26,876 --> 01:44:29,811
Jyoti give me some time!

1310
01:44:29,912 --> 01:44:34,406
If i could spend a moment with you...

1311
01:44:35,718 --> 01:44:37,709
...would i waste a moment?

1312
01:44:41,991 --> 01:44:47,623
I really can't
bear to live with you!

1313
01:45:04,914 --> 01:45:09,613
Sir, enough! I
can't take it anymore!

1314
01:45:11,354 --> 01:45:13,686
I can't keep up with
this sham, anymore!

1315
01:45:15,424 --> 01:45:18,587
The price i have paid so far,
is way beyond my means!

1316
01:45:21,864 --> 01:45:24,856
Here's my resignation
and my sincere apologies!

1317
01:45:26,869 --> 01:45:28,461
It's only a matter
of a few more days!

1318
01:45:28,871 --> 01:45:31,066
Besides only you
and i know the truth!

1319
01:45:31,874 --> 01:45:35,469
When you ruin K.K's drug mafia,
then everyone will know...

1320
01:45:35,578 --> 01:45:38,741
...how you went along
with him and destroyed him!

1321
01:45:38,848 --> 01:45:40,543
You have to make this sacrifice!

1322
01:45:40,650 --> 01:45:43,949
No Sir! I won't be
able to do this now!

1323
01:45:45,888 --> 01:45:49,824
I wish to return to
my life and my people!

1324
01:45:50,860 --> 01:45:57,095
Ashwin, i am dealing with
this truth along with you!

1325
01:45:58,901 --> 01:46:02,428
The woman K.K misbehaved
with in the party last night...

1326
01:46:03,906 --> 01:46:07,672
...is your wife, but
she is also my daughter!

1327
01:46:09,779 --> 01:46:11,838
I have swallowed the gulp
of blood as well, Ashwin!

1328
01:46:14,417 --> 01:46:20,583
A commissioner of police watched
& bore everything, impotently!

1329
01:46:22,858 --> 01:46:24,826
At the brink of this last step...

1330
01:46:25,695 --> 01:46:28,459
...i can't permit you
or myself to be weak!

1331
01:46:49,719 --> 01:46:54,486
What luck! My home has become
a palace, by your arrival here!

1332
01:46:55,591 --> 01:46:57,481
How come you have
chosen me for this honour?

1333
01:46:58,060 --> 01:47:01,552
Ashwin, i've heard you
are divorcing your wife!

1334
01:47:02,398 --> 01:47:04,723
That's what i just told that
old father in law of mine!

1335
01:47:06,068 --> 01:47:10,562
If you divorce his daughter,
Shrivastav will create a ruckus.

1336
01:47:11,841 --> 01:47:13,809
He will declare battle against you.

1337
01:47:14,744 --> 01:47:16,575
And it will affect
my business directly.

1338
01:47:16,679 --> 01:47:19,580
Wait and watch the
effect on your business K.K!

1339
01:47:20,850 --> 01:47:24,445
When we walk backwards,
we walk straighter!

1340
01:47:25,688 --> 01:47:28,384
I want to turen your
business into an empire, K.K.

1341
01:47:28,691 --> 01:47:33,060
Yes! I have spoken to Shrivastav
about divorce just like that!

1342
01:47:33,963 --> 01:47:35,988
He won't let the divorce
happen nor do i want it!

1343
01:47:37,867 --> 01:47:40,734
You must have seen
enough evil in me!

1344
01:47:41,570 --> 01:47:44,903
I know how to threaten a good
man and bring him to my view!

1345
01:47:46,442 --> 01:47:50,003
And besides, i am,
still his only son in law!

1346
01:47:50,980 --> 01:47:54,814
That old man will have
to dance to my tune!

1347
01:47:54,984 --> 01:47:56,008
I never thought of that!

1348
01:47:56,886 --> 01:47:58,683
Shrivastav can be used as well!

1349
01:48:01,457 --> 01:48:02,481
Good morning.

1350
01:48:12,335 --> 01:48:15,964
Ashwin, this is the last
mile of our friendship!

1351
01:48:17,740 --> 01:48:19,571
The place where i have trapped fate!

1352
01:48:20,843 --> 01:48:24,677
Whoever sets foot here,
is successful!

1353
01:48:34,857 --> 01:48:37,792
K.K i understand that
this white stuff is cocaine!

1354
01:48:38,761 --> 01:48:40,058
But why this setup?

1355
01:48:40,763 --> 01:48:45,393
This is a plant which produces
the best cocaine in the world!

1356
01:48:46,969 --> 01:48:52,703
And once this cocaine hits the
tongue of international markets.

1357
01:48:55,511 --> 01:48:59,538
Then people will look at my
success through a telescope!

1358
01:49:01,717 --> 01:49:05,346
I'm sorry K.K, the
roots are strong...

1359
01:49:05,454 --> 01:49:07,945
...but the trees aren't tall enough!

1360
01:49:09,325 --> 01:49:10,952
On the basis of this power...

1361
01:49:11,827 --> 01:49:15,024
...the country should've streets
& crossroads named after you!

1362
01:49:15,931 --> 01:49:19,560
Customs and ministers
are in my kitty, now!

1363
01:49:20,836 --> 01:49:22,565
But the problem is the cops!

1364
01:49:24,740 --> 01:49:28,039
This Khaki uniform, crosses
my path at the worst times!

1365
01:49:28,677 --> 01:49:31,373
I shall turn the entire
police force of this city...

1366
01:49:31,480 --> 01:49:36,042
...into your loyal force, if not
i shan't call myself your pal!

1367
01:49:37,620 --> 01:49:42,455
And K.K, after seeing all
this, i don't know why...

1368
01:49:42,558 --> 01:49:45,823
...i feel a bit too greedy today!

1369
01:49:47,563 --> 01:49:49,929
Sir i have seen every
bit of K.K's sinful empire!

1370
01:49:50,866 --> 01:49:53,528
And now, i am ready to
burn the whole thing down!

1371
01:49:53,869 --> 01:49:55,063
Then what are we waiting for?

1372
01:49:55,438 --> 01:49:58,839
Say the words and i'll hand over
the entire police force to you!

1373
01:49:58,941 --> 01:50:03,401
No. I don't want a
single cop with me!

1374
01:50:03,879 --> 01:50:05,710
K.K has bought them all over!

1375
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,908
If he gets news of our attack...

1376
01:50:11,387 --> 01:50:14,481
...he will erase all proof
much before we reach there!

1377
01:50:14,924 --> 01:50:17,825
- Then? - I just need 4
men for this operation, Sir!

1378
01:50:18,394 --> 01:50:21,488
Vijay, Ajay,
Captain Sood, and Hariya!

1379
01:50:21,664 --> 01:50:23,723
I trust them completely Sir!

1380
01:50:25,534 --> 01:50:29,368
Such a huge operation,
with just four of them?

1381
01:50:29,839 --> 01:50:31,500
And to issue permissions for them...

1382
01:50:31,607 --> 01:50:32,938
...is something i can't manage!

1383
01:50:35,411 --> 01:50:36,842
I'll need to talk to the minister!

1384
01:50:37,346 --> 01:50:40,042
You want this leaving
aside the cops in the state?

1385
01:50:40,950 --> 01:50:42,577
It's a big risk i am taking!

1386
01:50:43,352 --> 01:50:44,979
All on your gualantee, Commissioner!

1387
01:50:45,955 --> 01:50:48,515
Be very sure, that
nothing untoward happens!

1388
01:50:48,624 --> 01:50:50,387
Okay sir. - Thank you
very much sir.

1389
01:50:52,228 --> 01:50:54,287
Why didn't i think of this?

1390
01:50:56,398 --> 01:50:58,366
My duty has blinded me!

1391
01:51:00,236 --> 01:51:05,435
I didn't stop to think, i
am accusing my own brother!

1392
01:51:08,010 --> 01:51:11,036
And the poison in sister's heart!

1393
01:51:13,816 --> 01:51:19,049
Vijay, creating the
hate was part of the plan!

1394
01:51:20,489 --> 01:51:22,889
Whatever you did
from your side was fine!

1395
01:51:23,425 --> 01:51:24,790
But Uncle!

1396
01:51:26,362 --> 01:51:30,890
I don't know how
brother bore our harsh words!

1397
01:51:32,268 --> 01:51:36,898
And we said such
harsh words, unknowingly!

1398
01:51:38,173 --> 01:51:41,404
The goal was huge, so
everyone had to bear it.

1399
01:51:43,512 --> 01:51:46,481
But we did reach our
destination after all!

1400
01:51:50,519 --> 01:51:54,683
Brother, when you spoke
against me & cancelled my bail...

1401
01:51:54,790 --> 01:52:01,252
...i wanted to kill you!

1402
01:52:02,464 --> 01:52:08,869
I kept you in jail, so the
K.K's men wouldn't kill you!

1403
01:52:09,738 --> 01:52:16,974
Brother! You kept
thinking about me and i...

1404
01:52:19,882 --> 01:52:21,713
...i am ashamed!

1405
01:52:22,918 --> 01:52:26,445
Till yesterday i lowered my
heat before the evil called Daata!

1406
01:52:28,223 --> 01:52:35,220
But today! I hand myself over to
you & i swear on the river Ganga.

1407
01:52:36,165 --> 01:52:41,899
Now i will try to emulate you!

1408
01:52:42,972 --> 01:52:46,066
That's it Hariya! Don't
praise me to that extent!

1409
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:49,400
I'm a very ordinary guy! Let's go!

1410
01:52:50,446 --> 01:52:51,743
Brother!

1411
01:52:57,453 --> 01:53:02,857
Officer, your devotion to
duty, has taught me a lot!

1412
01:53:05,894 --> 01:53:08,192
I was very sad!

1413
01:53:08,797 --> 01:53:10,697
My courage had scattered!

1414
01:53:11,433 --> 01:53:16,200
I felt that people's corruption
will tear this country apart!

1415
01:53:17,806 --> 01:53:21,367
And people like K.K
will enjoy their rule!

1416
01:53:22,745 --> 01:53:25,714
But today after seeing
you i belive once again...

1417
01:53:25,814 --> 01:53:29,443
...our country can be saved!

1418
01:53:43,465 --> 01:53:47,401
Hey Vijay do you
still have any complaints?

1419
01:53:51,240 --> 01:53:53,674
You're standing
there looking downcast...

1420
01:53:53,776 --> 01:53:56,677
...the way you did as a kid,
when you got your results!

1421
01:53:56,779 --> 01:54:01,842
-And your marks were low!
- Forgive me, brother!

1422
01:54:02,384 --> 01:54:04,352
Forgive what? Silly boy!

1423
01:54:05,387 --> 01:54:09,687
Forgive What? If you
hadn't behaved the way you did...

1424
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:14,752
...i would have thought, i
had failed in bringing you up!

1425
01:54:15,798 --> 01:54:17,698
You didn't even spare your brother...

1426
01:54:17,800 --> 01:54:21,031
...when it came to judging
right & wrong! Wonderful!

1427
01:54:21,236 --> 01:54:25,195
Ashwin, let's discuss
some things about work!

1428
01:54:25,841 --> 01:54:27,035
We have very little time!

1429
01:54:27,342 --> 01:54:29,902
These are the maps og
K.K's special lairs!

1430
01:54:30,412 --> 01:54:34,143
The entrances and exits,
the surrounding buildings!

1431
01:54:35,451 --> 01:54:37,817
The distance from the
trees and their heights!

1432
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:40,884
The information about these has
been given in the numbered key.

1433
01:54:41,457 --> 01:54:43,721
From tomorow evening at 7
pm, till day after 5 am...

1434
01:54:43,826 --> 01:54:46,056
...we have ten hours altogether!

1435
01:54:46,862 --> 01:54:50,389
We have to gain control
aver all these lairs, somehow!

1436
01:54:55,871 --> 01:55:00,001
ACP Ashwini Kumar, i have
fallen in love with you!

1437
01:55:00,809 --> 01:55:02,743
Whether you feel the same or not!

1438
01:55:02,945 --> 01:55:04,344
This is a vow of friendship!

1439
01:55:04,446 --> 01:55:11,352
That your corpse will be
paraded in great style!

1440
01:55:12,888 --> 01:55:16,346
Now the match begins!

1441
01:55:17,826 --> 01:55:21,694
Your people are sitting here....

1442
01:55:21,797 --> 01:55:24,766
...forsaking your families
and work, to think about me!

1443
01:55:25,400 --> 01:55:27,868
So i thought, i should
come and meet you myself!

1444
01:55:30,405 --> 01:55:34,102
Ashwin, you have
experienced my friendship!

1445
01:55:35,077 --> 01:55:39,707
So you would know very well,
whoever tries to fool K.K...

1446
01:55:39,815 --> 01:55:45,219
...that i split open their
akulls and expose their brains!

1447
01:55:46,822 --> 01:55:52,089
A.K take these 5 warriors on the
truck and take them to the road!

1448
01:55:53,195 --> 01:55:55,663
They are filled with
patriotic fervour!

1449
01:55:57,199 --> 01:56:01,329
And we will discuss
things with the commissioner!

1450
01:56:01,837 --> 01:56:04,032
We'll have some
booze and make him happy!

1451
01:56:04,273 --> 01:56:06,833
Come on!

1452
01:56:13,782 --> 01:56:19,345
Ashwin. it was wrong of
you to pitch wits against me!

1453
01:56:20,789 --> 01:56:25,192
I shall send you 6 kms
away to make your first move!

1454
01:56:26,161 --> 01:56:29,358
You have to return from
yhere, in ten minutes!

1455
01:56:30,199 --> 01:56:36,104
If you don't return, i shall
rub your father in law out!

1456
01:56:37,739 --> 01:56:39,866
Go on, the first test awaits you!

1457
01:57:05,934 --> 01:57:09,165
The distance is great and the
commissioner has very little time.

1458
01:57:10,439 --> 01:57:14,739
You can reach back in a
jiffy provided you fly there!

1459
01:58:07,963 --> 01:58:11,399
Oh god! They beat
him up so unmercifully!

1460
01:58:14,202 --> 01:58:18,832
But his fight was with me!
Then why did he hurt him?

1461
01:58:21,977 --> 01:58:27,415
K.K you have committed a big sin!

1462
01:58:27,716 --> 01:58:32,085
Brother, i think we are
being set up in this crime!

1463
01:58:36,458 --> 01:58:38,187
You're not being set up, Mr. Vijay!

1464
01:58:39,461 --> 01:58:41,292
You have already been set up.

1465
01:58:43,131 --> 01:58:44,758
Mr. K.K, you know...

1466
01:58:44,866 --> 01:58:47,300
...he plays chess with both hands.

1467
01:58:47,903 --> 01:58:49,029
You all are trapped!

1468
01:58:49,471 --> 01:58:53,373
The first move, Shrivastav death!

1469
01:58:56,144 --> 01:58:59,978
The second move is all
of you being arrested!

1470
01:59:00,349 --> 01:59:02,044
We are all eye witnesses here!

1471
01:59:11,793 --> 01:59:13,658
We are all witnesses!

1472
01:59:22,404 --> 01:59:24,065
Jyoyi, you're here?

1473
01:59:26,842 --> 01:59:33,406
If i had permission, i
could return to that house!

1474
01:59:35,317 --> 01:59:39,014
By accusing you, i have
committed a grave sin!

1475
01:59:40,956 --> 01:59:46,861
Since you have gone, that home
has just been a house of brick!

1476
01:59:48,463 --> 01:59:50,363
Make it a home once more!

1477
01:59:50,732 --> 01:59:53,792
I was your weakness,
instead of your strength!

1478
01:59:56,338 --> 01:59:59,307
But Ashwin, don't give up the fight!

1479
02:00:01,009 --> 02:00:03,136
You must succeed!

1480
02:00:04,413 --> 02:00:07,814
This false accusation
won't stand for long in court.

1481
02:00:09,017 --> 02:00:15,980
And now, you have your
4 brothers with you!

1482
02:00:27,302 --> 02:00:28,735
Jyoyi!

1483
02:00:31,206 --> 02:00:33,333
I am returning to my home, today.

1484
02:00:58,133 --> 02:01:00,192
So couldn't play
against me, could you?

1485
02:01:01,336 --> 02:01:03,702
Five moves! First
Shrivastav kicked the bucket....

1486
02:01:03,805 --> 02:01:07,366
...then you all landed up here!

1487
02:01:08,310 --> 02:01:09,709
In the pavilion!

1488
02:01:10,479 --> 02:01:18,443
Ashwin the next match will
be played with your wife!

1489
02:01:22,157 --> 02:01:26,890
I am your friend, i must
take care of your wife's youth!

1490
02:01:28,029 --> 02:01:30,463
When she needs you every night...

1491
02:01:31,433 --> 02:01:32,900
...i will see to that need!

1492
02:01:33,001 --> 02:01:36,232
K.K! Scream, shout, cry!

1493
02:01:36,938 --> 02:01:38,735
That is all you have to do now!

1494
02:01:39,207 --> 02:01:46,079
K.K you will pay for
your disgusting words!

1495
02:01:47,249 --> 02:01:53,017
But if you do anything
bestial your end will be so scary...

1496
02:01:53,121 --> 02:02:00,027
Scary? Playing with
scary things is K.K's style!

1497
02:02:00,395 --> 02:02:03,853
Tonight's match is fixed
with me and your wife!

1498
02:02:05,400 --> 02:02:09,769
I wonder what will happen to
that innocent daughter of yours!

1499
02:02:11,339 --> 02:02:12,863
I feel so bad for orphans!

1500
02:02:14,309 --> 02:02:15,776
So let's do one thing!

1501
02:02:16,144 --> 02:02:20,706
Let's send her to the
pavilion above as well!

1502
02:02:21,416 --> 02:02:28,822
What do they call it?
A merciful death!

1503
02:02:29,758 --> 02:02:34,718
K.K you wait, our next
meeting will be the day you die!

1504
02:02:35,197 --> 02:02:38,064
If you commit this sin,
then you will...

1505
02:02:38,500 --> 02:02:42,231
Vijay, he can do anything!

1506
02:02:43,905 --> 02:02:45,736
We have to get to Jyoyi!

1507
02:02:46,441 --> 02:02:48,807
Brother, we must do something!

1508
02:02:49,044 --> 02:02:51,740
Officer, there's only one way out!

1509
02:02:57,452 --> 02:03:00,683
Jyoyi! - Sister!

1510
02:03:00,789 --> 02:03:07,422
Chinky! - Jyoti! - Sister!

1511
02:03:11,233 --> 02:03:12,757
You?

1512
02:03:26,414 --> 02:03:29,440
Are you all right?

1513
02:03:30,485 --> 02:03:31,713
What's wrong with me?

1514
02:03:42,764 --> 02:03:44,732
But how have you all reached here?

1515
02:03:48,436 --> 02:03:53,066
Vijay ! How did you all get out?

1516
02:03:57,379 --> 02:04:04,012
All this? Have you
broken out of jail?

1517
02:04:05,987 --> 02:04:07,682
But why?

1518
02:04:09,124 --> 02:04:10,682
Why doesn't someone tell me?

1519
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:15,186
Vijay, you tell me,
why did you all do this?

1520
02:04:18,066 --> 02:04:21,797
This act of yours will
convince the law even further.

1521
02:04:31,346 --> 02:04:35,043
You are all under
arrest, once again.

1522
02:04:37,185 --> 02:04:39,210
You escaped jail so easily!

1523
02:04:43,124 --> 02:04:48,118
But this time round,
you will go forever!

1524
02:04:49,831 --> 02:04:52,061
You guys got fooled by Mr. K.K!

1525
02:04:52,167 --> 02:04:53,725
He was just joking with you!

1526
02:05:00,442 --> 02:05:03,343
Ashwin, what are you doing?

1527
02:05:03,579 --> 02:05:05,846
Forget the public, even i 
thought you were innocent!

1528
02:05:05,847 --> 02:05:07,838
That you have been falsely set up!

1529
02:05:09,317 --> 02:05:11,683
But by running away
before the court's decree...

1530
02:05:11,786 --> 02:05:14,346
...you have admitted to your crimes!

1531
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:18,848
Because only those who fear
punishment, run away from jail!

1532
02:05:20,295 --> 02:05:24,698
And that promise i had made to you?

1533
02:05:24,799 --> 02:05:29,702
I will fulfil it, not today...

1534
02:05:29,804 --> 02:05:32,034
...but some other day!

1535
02:05:36,244 --> 02:05:39,441
Yes, we are guilty
of escaping from jail!

1536
02:05:40,248 --> 02:05:42,716
But not from the fear that...

1537
02:05:42,817 --> 02:05:45,417
...we can't prove our innocence
in the Shrivastav murder case!

1538
02:05:46,154 --> 02:05:47,781
We are innocent!

1539
02:05:48,223 --> 02:05:51,989
Judge, there was only one
reason for our escape from jail!

1540
02:05:52,227 --> 02:05:55,060
They may not fear the punishment!

1541
02:05:55,363 --> 02:06:00,926
But to prove their guilt, we
have proofs and many witnesses!

1542
02:06:01,035 --> 02:06:04,732
I have one witness too!

1543
02:06:05,707 --> 02:06:10,735
Who will prove the falsehood of
all your evidence & witnesses!

1544
02:06:12,947 --> 02:06:18,078
That witness is the home
Minister Purushottam Sinha!

1545
02:06:19,888 --> 02:06:22,686
I request the court,
to call him from Delhi...

1546
02:06:22,791 --> 02:06:26,022
...and present him
for the court hearing!

1547
02:07:38,233 --> 02:07:39,700
No! No!

1548
02:07:42,237 --> 02:07:44,432
If you don't fulfill my wish...

1549
02:07:45,907 --> 02:07:48,375
...the child will slip
from my brother's hands!

1550
02:07:50,478 --> 02:07:54,039
To make sure that doesn't
happen is your responsibility!

1551
02:07:55,950 --> 02:07:57,645
Do you understand?

1552
02:08:07,295 --> 02:08:11,994
No! Stop all this!

1553
02:08:12,433 --> 02:08:13,661
Let me go!

1554
02:08:17,438 --> 02:08:20,407
Brother, stop it!

1555
02:08:44,732 --> 02:08:46,700
No!

1556
02:08:53,041 --> 02:08:54,633
I was very surprised, your Honour...

1557
02:08:54,742 --> 02:08:57,643
...when the court ordered
me to be present in court...

1558
02:08:57,745 --> 02:09:00,976
...since they have asked me
to testify on their behalf!

1559
02:09:01,950 --> 02:09:04,646
People i have not met in this life...

1560
02:09:04,752 --> 02:09:07,380
...and i don't believe
there is more than one life!

1561
02:09:09,123 --> 02:09:12,991
No, your Honour, it's not
true i permitted to do anything!

1562
02:09:13,227 --> 02:09:17,891
Ashwin Kumar should be allowed
to from his army & rule the city.

1563
02:09:18,199 --> 02:09:21,396
I trust the law and police in
my country! I can't permit this!

1564
02:09:22,170 --> 02:09:24,400
Do you people want to say
anything in your testimony?

1565
02:09:29,043 --> 02:09:32,171
After examining all proofs
and statements of witnesses...

1566
02:09:35,049 --> 02:09:39,679
...this court has
reached the conclusion that...

1567
02:09:39,787 --> 02:09:46,090
...that the accused, Ashwin
Kumar and his accomplices...

1568
02:09:57,772 --> 02:10:04,302
Today, these hands are
threatening the law!

1569
02:10:05,013 --> 02:10:06,708
If possible do forgive me.

1570
02:10:07,248 --> 02:10:10,046
Come on.

1571
02:10:35,043 --> 02:10:36,738
They first escaped from the court!

1572
02:10:37,178 --> 02:10:40,841
Then they took the
corpses from the hospital!

1573
02:10:41,249 --> 02:10:44,741
And what did the police do?
Kept watching, that's what!

1574
02:10:45,053 --> 02:10:48,181
To catch criminals, the
police have to be alert Choughule!

1575
02:10:48,723 --> 02:10:50,691
- I feel like giving
you one... - Brother!

1576
02:10:50,892 --> 02:10:53,360
They mustn't be in this city!
They must be in another city!

1577
02:10:53,728 --> 02:10:56,356
I shall send the police
force out of the city!

1578
02:10:56,464 --> 02:10:57,863
Choughule!

1579
02:10:59,067 --> 02:11:03,299
When a tamed cat becomes a
man eater, it's very dangerous!

1580
02:11:04,072 --> 02:11:05,699
If you can't catch those guys...

1581
02:11:06,074 --> 02:11:09,373
...then all 5 of them
will be on our backs!

1582
02:11:09,477 --> 02:11:12,378
Sir, i don't know
when they came and went!

1583
02:11:12,480 --> 02:11:15,449
Were they to ask before coming?
Seek your blessings while going?

1584
02:11:17,151 --> 02:11:20,052
Choughule, they have
just taken the corpses now!

1585
02:11:20,488 --> 02:11:22,718
When they take you
away live and kicking...

1586
02:11:22,824 --> 02:11:26,385
...you will know how &
when they come and go!

1587
02:11:29,230 --> 02:11:31,926
Mr. K.K get me transferred!

1588
02:11:32,033 --> 02:11:35,059
You will get transferred!

1589
02:11:35,169 --> 02:11:36,261
You will get transferred!

1590
02:11:36,370 --> 02:11:37,803
But straight to heaven!

1591
02:11:38,272 --> 02:11:40,331
You still can't get one
thing through your fat head?

1592
02:11:41,042 --> 02:11:42,302
Why did they take the corpses?

1593
02:11:43,778 --> 02:11:48,181
You moron! They took
them to cremate them!

1594
02:11:48,283 --> 02:11:49,773
They are Hindus!

1595
02:11:49,784 --> 02:11:51,808
They want to commit the
corpses to the holy fire!

1596
02:11:51,853 --> 02:11:56,347
Choughule, go out
and find all 5 of them!

1597
02:11:57,725 --> 02:11:59,955
If you see smoke
rising from the wilderness...

1598
02:12:00,061 --> 02:12:01,085
Smoke rising.

1599
02:12:01,195 --> 02:12:02,219
...there they are!

1600
02:12:30,091 --> 02:12:36,155
"Oh flower that got burnt,
i swear upon you!"

1601
02:12:38,099 --> 02:12:44,004
"Oh flower that was ground
into the dust, i swear by you!"

1602
02:12:46,040 --> 02:12:53,412
"We will spill the
blood of the evil killers!"

1603
02:12:54,048 --> 02:13:00,248
"Oh flower that got burnt,
i swear upon you!"

1604
02:13:02,223 --> 02:13:07,889
"Oh flower that was ground
into the dust, i swear by you!"

1605
02:13:10,264 --> 02:13:17,898
"We will spill the
blood of the evil killers!"

1606
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:24,109
"Oh flower that got burnt,
i swear upon you!"

1607
02:13:57,912 --> 02:14:01,348
"We have risen as a storm!"

1608
02:14:01,916 --> 02:14:05,875
"We will have our revenge!"

1609
02:14:09,991 --> 02:14:17,830
"The story of the
evil ones will end now!"

1610
02:14:18,232 --> 02:14:19,290
"A whole new...

1611
02:14:19,934 --> 02:14:21,424
...history...

1612
02:14:22,236 --> 02:14:25,831
...will rise from these flames!"

1613
02:14:25,940 --> 02:14:33,779
"We will spill the
blood of the evil killers!"

1614
02:14:34,081 --> 02:14:39,917
"Oh flower that got burnt,
i swear upon you!"

1615
02:14:42,089 --> 02:14:47,994
"Oh flower that was ground
into the dust, i swear by you!"

1616
02:15:33,140 --> 02:15:36,837
"We have taken the
ashes from this pyre...

1617
02:15:36,944 --> 02:15:40,778
...and smeared our forehesds with it!"

1618
02:15:45,252 --> 02:15:48,847
"Our lives will be cursed...

1619
02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:52,719
...if a single anemy survives!"

1620
02:15:53,094 --> 02:15:56,723
"The five Pandavas are saying...

1621
02:15:56,831 --> 02:16:00,232
...war is our sworn duty!"

1622
02:16:00,835 --> 02:16:08,003
"We will spill the
blood of the evil killers!"

1623
02:16:08,376 --> 02:16:13,939
"Oh flower that got burnt,
i swear upon you!"

1624
02:16:16,050 --> 02:16:21,352
"Oh flower who was ground in
the dust, i swear upon you!"

1625
02:16:23,324 --> 02:16:30,253
"We will spill the
blood of the evil killers!"

1626
02:16:30,931 --> 02:16:36,028
"Oh flower that got burnt,
i swear upon you!"

1627
02:16:38,005 --> 02:16:43,375
"Oh flower who was ground in
the dust, i swear upon you!"

1628
02:16:47,081 --> 02:16:48,975
We will spill the
blood of the evil killers!

1629
02:17:21,215 --> 02:17:23,080
Brother, you all leave from here!

1630
02:17:23,184 --> 02:17:26,017
And go straight to the Black
Mountain, we'll meet there.

1631
02:17:54,682 --> 02:17:56,843
Captain take them and leave!
I'll hold them off!

1632
02:17:56,951 --> 02:17:57,975
Hurry up!

1633
02:19:49,063 --> 02:19:50,291
Who is it?

1634
02:19:58,172 --> 02:20:00,003
How long will we keep
rinning away from them?

1635
02:20:00,107 --> 02:20:01,972
Their death is our goal!

1636
02:20:02,076 --> 02:20:03,100
Till when?

1637
02:20:05,679 --> 02:20:08,113
I can't bear to put
off their death anumore!

1638
02:20:10,884 --> 02:20:14,081
From tomorow, we will
begin to slaughter them!

1639
02:20:14,755 --> 02:20:16,382
We will slaughter them one by one!

1640
02:21:21,955 --> 02:21:24,389
No!

1641
02:21:27,961 --> 02:21:28,985
Don't kill me!

1642
02:21:30,764 --> 02:21:31,788
Forgive me!

1643
02:21:34,835 --> 02:21:36,200
What did i ever do to you people?

1644
02:21:37,104 --> 02:21:38,401
No! Forgive me!

1645
02:21:38,505 --> 02:21:41,997
Forgive me!

1646
02:22:22,149 --> 02:22:26,916
Mr. K.K, save me!

1647
02:22:27,254 --> 02:22:29,779
David was killed in the car park!
The minister in the water!

1648
02:22:30,090 --> 02:22:31,853
They will find me and kill me too!

1649
02:22:34,962 --> 02:22:36,987
The air just changed
it's course a bit!

1650
02:22:37,097 --> 02:22:40,123
And the rats are jumping off
the ship, thinking it's a storm!

1651
02:22:41,835 --> 02:22:44,463
Go and hide in our factory!

1652
02:22:44,772 --> 02:22:46,205
Listen! - What?

1653
02:22:47,107 --> 02:22:49,007
Wipe your sweat off
before you reach there!

1654
02:22:53,046 --> 02:22:57,745
The lion's lair can't harbor a rat!

1655
02:30:37,043 --> 02:30:41,343
Recognise this place!

1656
02:30:43,116 --> 02:30:46,745
Ask these cliffs, they
have been eye witnesses...

1657
02:30:47,320 --> 02:30:50,756
...to the two lives that
you put out, so mercilessly!

1658
02:30:52,859 --> 02:30:56,056
We cremated them right here!

1659
02:30:56,162 --> 02:31:00,292
Not just us, these
mountains are filled the lava...

1660
02:31:01,067 --> 02:31:04,969
...whose sole purpose is to
turn your bones to dust!

1661
02:31:05,071 --> 02:31:06,971
Today, the volcano will burst &.

1662
02:31:08,008 --> 02:31:10,442
You will feel every
ember on your body!

1663
02:31:11,344 --> 02:31:14,370
Soon enough, you will be a corpse!

1664
02:31:15,382 --> 02:31:17,782
And after that,
you will turn to ash!

1665
02:31:41,975 --> 02:31:49,472
That evening the sun set in joy
on the chariot of the 5 Pandavas.

1666
02:31:51,451 --> 02:31:54,079
But there were lines of
hope on the sun's face!

1667
02:31:55,121 --> 02:31:59,114
The sun had seen that crime
had been erased from the city.

1668
02:32:00,226 --> 02:32:03,195
These Pandavas were
definitely punished by the law!

1669
02:32:03,997 --> 02:32:05,897
They accepted it as a welcome gift.

1670
02:32:06,800 --> 02:32:11,066
Since these Pandavas had
offered the city peace as a gift!
