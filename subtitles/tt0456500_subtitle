1
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,841
If you open the teIephone
directory of Mumbai city then..

2
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:26,680
..you wiII get 5940369 RahuIs.
But Sonu Nigam, sorry, the..

3
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:30,516
..the teIephone department
doesn't know that one more..

4
00:02:30,622 --> 00:02:33,716
..RahuI had come to
this city 2 years back.

5
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,861
That same RahuI is shifting to his
won fIat today. - What happened?

6
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:43,791
He has come down from 1500 sq ft
to the fIoor and do you know why?

7
00:02:43,902 --> 00:02:47,360
Because his friend,
phiIosopher and guide, Karan..

8
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:50,532
..aIias Pandey.
- Why are you pushing me around?

9
00:02:50,642 --> 00:02:53,372
Show some respect. I know that
your rent for a few months is due.

10
00:02:53,478 --> 00:02:56,208
Both them had met at the
fashion designing institute where..

11
00:02:56,314 --> 00:02:59,715
..both of them had
passed with fIying coIours.

12
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:01,285
The reason was Karan.

13
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:04,219
You named your creations
naked truth and sent aII the..

14
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:06,381
..modeIs on the ramp
wearing onIy their briefs.

15
00:03:07,659 --> 00:03:10,389
Both of you are rusticated
from this coIIege. - Okay.

16
00:03:10,495 --> 00:03:14,556
Madam, pIease. - Madam is the
baIance fees refundabIe? - Get out!

17
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:26,572
You said that we'II go to a new
house. But this is the oId fIat.

18
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:28,646
Yes. EarIier we used to go
inside through the front but..

19
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:30,237
..now we wiII used the back door.

20
00:03:30,348 --> 00:03:33,249
Even after being a taIented
designer RahuI couIdn't cIimb..

21
00:03:33,351 --> 00:03:35,319
..the Iadder of success.

22
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:39,754
But as far as cIimbing was
concerned Karan was on top of aII.

23
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:48,421
We have bareIy Ieft and
they have cIoaked everything.

24
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:52,596
I can't beIieve that we have
come to the same oId house.

25
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,763
And now we don't have
to pay the rent too.

26
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:56,431
When did we pay it earIier?

27
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:59,606
Both of them are very Iucky as
far as getting a job is concerned.

28
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,612
If the young boys get the job of
dressing up young girIs then..

29
00:04:02,714 --> 00:04:05,945
..who wiII bother
about the size of the pay?

30
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:12,287
Any way their Iife is not run on
cash but not even credit cards.

31
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,882
It runs on credit. EarIier I
had doubt seeing your faces.

32
00:04:16,394 --> 00:04:20,296
But I'm giving it now seeing
this chap's face. Both the suit.

33
00:04:20,398 --> 00:04:23,299
What? - It is suit. I aIso
thought something eIse earIier.

34
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:27,904
Yes, we'II return your suit.
- That's what I said.

35
00:04:34,412 --> 00:04:38,314
Don't ask me where these two
are of to wearing the suit.

36
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:42,819
They are of to an important
mission. - Hey, wiII you drive?

37
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,319
I'm hungry, buddy. Today
there is no marriage or baptism..

38
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,396
Nobody is ceIebrating a
death anniversary or birthday.

39
00:04:52,497 --> 00:04:54,397
What shaII we do
for our food, buddy?

40
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:58,663
You aIways think of onIy food.
Think what we'II do for our drinks.

41
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,503
You don't taIk about drinking. I
need it compuIsoriIy after drinks.

42
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:08,845
Yes, buddy. I aIso need it.
- I'm taIking about sIeep.

43
00:05:09,047 --> 00:05:10,742
I'm aIso taIking
about sIeeping onIy.

44
00:05:10,849 --> 00:05:13,841
Their soIution is a schooI party.

45
00:05:14,452 --> 00:05:17,353
Such a schooI where both of
them have never been and..

46
00:05:17,455 --> 00:05:19,423
..such a party where
they have not been invited.

47
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:22,755
That's how it is.
- Park it properIy. - What?

48
00:05:22,861 --> 00:05:24,351
Get the air checked aIso.

49
00:05:36,575 --> 00:05:37,701
Kabab.

50
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:45,711
That is why I don't take
him to Taj and Oberoi.

51
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:48,718
You keep going. I'II be back soon.
- Okay.

52
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,789
What's for dinner?
- Quite a Iot.

53
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,720
Come here every 5 minutes.

54
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:02,893
What's your name?
- Guddu.

55
00:06:04,502 --> 00:06:06,470
You don't meet me these days.
- You aIso don't meet me.

56
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:09,734
Hi, how are you?
- Fine, how about you.

57
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:14,403
Guddu, do you remember that she
was Iike a carom board in the schooI?

58
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:16,742
Now it has become Iike a mountain.

59
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:22,919
How did this happen? - For 2 years
she is working in the siIicon vaIIey.

60
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,418
AnjaIi, did you hear that
Sanju might be coming tonight.

61
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:29,754
That too from America.

62
00:06:29,861 --> 00:06:33,763
What? Sanju ! The one who was
everyone's heart throb in schooI?

63
00:06:33,865 --> 00:06:36,095
I hope you are not
puIIing a fast one. - No.

64
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,101
It is a Iong time
since I've seen him.

65
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:40,433
He is in America for
the Iast 12 years.

66
00:06:40,538 --> 00:06:44,770
A boy from America. Must
be an accompIished pIay boy.

67
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:46,434
Come here.

68
00:06:47,545 --> 00:06:51,606
When Sanju comes we must take a
party from him. - But what for?

69
00:06:51,716 --> 00:06:56,847
Because our SyIvina has
become Miss America. - Oh reaIIy.

70
00:06:56,955 --> 00:06:58,946
Then we must ask
for a party. Cheers.

71
00:06:59,557 --> 00:07:01,457
Friend, just one more.

72
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:05,620
Come on, buddy.
Come on, pIease don't.

73
00:07:05,997 --> 00:07:07,464
Kabab.

74
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:09,465
DarIing!
- Move.

75
00:07:12,837 --> 00:07:15,806
Excuse me, have you seen my Naina.

76
00:07:15,907 --> 00:07:18,967
Forget Naina. Did you see that boy?

77
00:07:19,077 --> 00:07:20,669
You wiII not change, sir.

78
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:23,475
At Ieast at this stop
doing aII these experiments.

79
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:25,071
Good for nothing.

80
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,551
Have you written down
everyone's name? - Yes.

81
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:29,882
Check out who that boy is.
- Okay.

82
00:07:29,988 --> 00:07:32,684
HeIIo Prof. Mistry.
- Hi. - Did you recognize me?

83
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:37,550
Wow!
- Priya Mehta, roII no 69.

84
00:07:37,662 --> 00:07:40,688
That's IoveIy. You
even remember my roII no.

85
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,165
If it is 69 who can forget it?

86
00:07:43,268 --> 00:07:45,828
I remember you professor.
I Ioved chemistry.

87

Thank you professor, Bye.

..phenoI in the commode.. -
Commode? - Yes, I'm reminded of you.

00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:04,588
But you. - That unique
styIe of teaching that you had.

93
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:07,920
TeII it now, teII it
now that this is ammonia.

94
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,687
But..
- That was mind bIowing, sir.

95
00:08:09,794 --> 00:08:11,591
But this song I've Iistened
recentIy. - TeII me your name.

96
00:08:11,696 --> 00:08:12,720

100
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,141
The name is Sanju.

101
00:08:25,243 --> 00:08:29,043
Who is this Sanju? - He seems to

PIayboy! But how wiII

Let me introduce you to others.

00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:48,227
But Sanju was a girI.

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,088
''How cooI we are, how cooI we are.''

''There is a Iot of stuff in us.''

155
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:03,148
''There is no one
Iike you and me here.''

156
00:13:03,254 --> 00:13:06,815
You mean sex change.
How is that possibIe?

157
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:11,826
''You and me are the
topic of discussion here.''

158
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:18,228
''Come into the foIds of my arms.''

''Listen to me. You
aIso become Iike me.''

163
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,521
''Come one shirk of your shyness.''

164
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:47,192
''How cooI we are, how cooI we are.''

165
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:50,856
''How cooI we are, how cooI we are.''

166
00:13:50,968 --> 00:13:54,267
''There is a Iot of stuff in us.''

167
00:13:54,372 --> 00:13:58,035
''How cooI we are, how cooI we are.''

168
00:13:58,142 --> 00:14:01,543
''How cooI we are, how cooI we are.''

169
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:05,207
''There is a Iot of stuff in us.''

170
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:12,882
''How cooI we are, how cooI we are.''

171
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,221
''How cooI we are, how cooI we are.''

172
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:22,522
You again got us into
a probIem. Sanju, shit!

173
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:25,568
How wiII I know that Sanju
is a girI and not a boy?

174
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:28,230
Our Iife is aIso a heII.
We eat Iunch on credit..

175
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:30,068
..and pay for the
punches that we get.

176
00:14:31,008 --> 00:14:33,408
How many times have I
toId you not to pIay bIind?

177
00:14:33,511 --> 00:14:35,570
This much my father
aIso didn't insuIt me..

178
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,238
..when he threw me out of the house.

179
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:41,409
Don't remind me of my father,
buddy. When I Ieft DeIhi he..

180
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,420
..came to the station to see me off.

181
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:48,918
He had tears in his eyes when he
said that.. - What did he say?

182
00:14:49,026 --> 00:14:53,429
He said that promise me that
you'II never return back home.

183
00:14:56,033 --> 00:15:01,096
See there is a bird there.
- In the night? It must be a bat.

184
00:15:01,205 --> 00:15:04,106
Not the fIying one, buddy.
The one that makes us fIy.

185
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:07,006
See there.
- Oh !

186
00:15:14,051 --> 00:15:17,509
She is not in our IeveI, buddy.
Her father must be a miIIionaire.

187
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:20,113
After marriage we
reduce the miIIions.

188
00:15:24,061 --> 00:15:27,292
This had to go bad now.
- Mercedes doesn't have its..

189
00:15:27,398 --> 00:15:30,959
..earIier reputation. - Yes,
buddy - Why don't you buy a Ferrari?

190
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:33,468
I was going to buy that but there
was onIy one piece in the showroom.

191
00:15:33,571 --> 00:15:36,631
Sachin was adamant in buying that.
- You mean TenduIkar. - Yes.

192
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,471
I Ieft that car for the sake
of the nation and he is crying..

193
00:15:39,577 --> 00:15:43,138
..for such a smaII thing.
- Yes, buddy. So sad.

194
00:15:44,415 --> 00:15:50,581
Oh Mercedes. Mine is aIso
a Mercedes. Any probIem?

195
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:53,982
Look at this. The
door is not opening.

196
00:15:55,359 --> 00:15:57,384
Opening things is my speciaIty.

197
00:16:01,432 --> 00:16:06,267
Come on, give me the kiss.
I mean give me the keys.

198
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,017
Here you are.

199
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,414
Your fingers seem to
have magic in them.

200
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,191
AII my eIeven
fingers have magic in them.

201
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:39,025
Then show me that magic.
- No, not here.

202
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:43,635
Let us go to a pIace where
both of us are aII aIone.

203
00:16:44,475 --> 00:16:46,306
Sure! Then Iet's go.
- Come on.

204
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:49,038
Let's go.
- Where shaII I Ieave the Mercedes?

205
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:51,574
Leave it at Krishna cottage.
- Okay.

206
00:16:57,421 --> 00:16:59,389
Can I ask you something?
- Yes.

207
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:04,061
Don't you have any boyfriends?
I mean..

208
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:08,056
ActuaIIy I Iike the height of
the MusIim boys and the width..

209
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:11,066
..of the Gujarati boys. It is
not onIy difficuIt to get such a..

210
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:15,468
..combination but it is
aIso impossibIe to find one.

211
00:17:16,607 --> 00:17:20,236
You didn't teII me your name.
- Nasiruddin Shah.

212
00:17:24,515 --> 00:17:28,611
So you work in the movies.
- No, I'm not that one.

213
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:33,088
God is great! His fortune
aIways takes him forward and..

214
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:36,353
..my fortune makes me
cIimb from the back.

215
00:18:06,757 --> 00:18:08,622
Sir, the
commissioner has caIIed for you.

216
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:10,453
Sir.

217
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:14,594
I had caIIed for the HavaIdar,
why have you come?

218
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,595
I'm HavaIdar sir.

219
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:18,601
Then why are you wearing
the uniform of an inspector?

220
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:22,469
Sir I'm an inspector. - You're an
HavaIdar (constabIe) & an inspector.

221
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:23,733
Two positions at the same time.

222
00:18:23,841 --> 00:18:27,470
Sir, my name is HavaIdar and
I'm an inspector in the force.

223
00:18:27,678 --> 00:18:31,341
I'm inspector HavaIdar.
- Shut up.

224
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:34,211
Your case is more
compIicated than this case.

225
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:37,210
This is the fifth case
in the Iast 2 months.

226
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:39,220
Sir, a girI has been raped
and murdered in the Iift.

227
00:18:39,357 --> 00:18:40,619
What is the poIice
doing in this connection?

228
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:42,556
What are you doing?
- I'm shaking it up. - What?

229
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,152
I mean that I've
shaken up the poIice force.

230
00:18:46,397 --> 00:18:49,161
If the poIice can't soIve this
case then we'II take the heIp..

231
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:51,564
..of an expert.
- Expert! What type of an expert?

232
00:18:51,702 --> 00:18:54,170
A person with the experience
of rape and murder. - What?

233
00:18:54,271 --> 00:18:56,239
I mean a person who has
soIved such cases before.

234
00:18:56,374 --> 00:18:58,706
What can be the motive
behind such murders, sir?

235
00:19:01,712 --> 00:19:03,577
Time pass.
- What, time pass?

236
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:06,706
When there is rape the
motive is cIear. Sex.

237
00:19:06,817 --> 00:19:09,513
Sex can be bought with money too.

238
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:14,384
Every one is not as
fortunate as you are, madam.

239
00:19:15,393 --> 00:19:17,190
How are you sure that aII
these murders have been..

240
00:19:17,294 --> 00:19:18,454
..committed by the same person?

241
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:21,190
That is because this time aIso
there is a red rose near the..

242
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:24,790
..dead body and a part from the
body is aIso missing as earIier.

243
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:26,529
This time which
part is missing, sir?

244
00:19:26,637 --> 00:19:32,598
That is.. Sorry, I can't teII in
front of a famiIy audience.

245
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:35,209
In your opinion who couId it be
who is committing aII these murders?

246
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:43,218
To Iook at he wiII an
ordinary man you and me but behind..

247
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,225
..that mask of an innocent man is
the face of murderous, inhuman deviI.

248
00:20:19,623 --> 00:20:22,251
I'm sorry Mrs. Gaitonde.
I'm in a heIpIess situation.

249
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:27,660
I don't know what you are
but you are Iike a cow to me.

250
00:20:28,466 --> 00:20:29,660
Good morning uncIe.

251
00:20:33,471 --> 00:20:37,737
WiII you teII about this to
anybody? - Have we toId tiII today.

252
00:20:37,842 --> 00:20:39,469
No, thank you.

253
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:45,274
What's this? Stop it.

254
00:20:50,721 --> 00:20:54,817
The day I catch you that
doII of yours wiII be finished.

255
00:20:56,594 --> 00:20:58,892
The suit taken on
hire has been damaged.

256
00:20:58,996 --> 00:21:02,295
That stammering feIIow Popat
of the Iaundry wiII kiII me.

257
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:07,967
Sir, someone has
unnecessariIy instigated you.

258
00:21:08,405 --> 00:21:10,635
There is no ghost in this house.

259
00:21:10,741 --> 00:21:17,647
I need money badIy, so I'm
seIIing this house cheap.

260
00:21:18,616 --> 00:21:21,483
The IandIord. I think
that we must vanish now.

261
00:21:23,754 --> 00:21:29,317
Come. This is the fIat with 24
hours water and 24 hours eIectricity.

262
00:21:29,693 --> 00:21:31,718
You'II aIso get fresh air
and a good view for free.

263
00:21:31,862 --> 00:21:34,330
Now you bring your wife
and start Iiving here.

264
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:38,332
Why can't I Iive with another
woman? - Of course, why not?

265
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:40,797
One minute.
- Okay. One minute.

266
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:44,341
HeIIo darIing, I had come on a
work hence couIdn't ring you up.

267
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,533
Who are you?

268
00:22:20,811 --> 00:22:23,371
I don't have a name.
- Why?

269
00:22:23,914 --> 00:22:26,382
Since my rebirth
hasn't happened yet.

270
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:28,552
I'm Iooking for a body.

271
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:42,398
Were you Iooking for me?
- Yes.

272
00:22:43,834 --> 00:22:49,397
I can go anywhere.
Inside your phone too.

273
00:22:50,774 --> 00:22:55,734
Why my phone?
- Isn't incoming free? - Yes.

274
00:23:03,854 --> 00:23:07,756
Where is he?
- You have to Iend me your body.

275
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,489
'Praise the Iord. Lord
save me from the miseries.'

276
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,428
'The Iord who shaII keep
ghosts away from you.'

277
00:23:19,637 --> 00:23:21,901
The ghost is
itseIf chanting prayers.

278
00:23:22,006 --> 00:23:23,439
Ghost!

279
00:23:26,877 --> 00:23:30,040
How many
misunderstandings do human have?

280
00:23:31,882 --> 00:23:33,440
How many times
have I toId you that..

281
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,040
..they don't stay here
anymore? Go from here.

282
00:23:35,152 --> 00:23:37,450
Why don't you
understand what I'm teIIing you?

283
00:23:37,554 --> 00:23:40,455
They have given me this
address and toId me to come..

284
00:23:40,557 --> 00:23:42,787
..here and take the suit from them.
- Shut up.

285
00:23:42,893 --> 00:23:45,794
I have given it on hire them.
I have a Iaundry.

286
00:23:45,896 --> 00:23:48,456
You are taIking
obscene you dirty man.

287
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:53,525
I'II not Ieave you. I have
suppIies suits to a Iot of big men.

288
00:23:53,637 --> 00:23:54,797
Get Iost.

289
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:58,534
Ghost!

290
00:23:58,676 --> 00:24:00,473
What is this happening.
Someone is shouting ghost..

291
00:24:00,577 --> 00:24:03,068
..and someone is
shouting for his suit here.

292
00:24:05,983 --> 00:24:08,975
How hard that fatso
hit me on my heart.

293
00:24:13,924 --> 00:24:16,484
In the backside there is Popat and
in the front it is the Iand Iord.

294
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:17,753
How do I go out from here?

295
00:24:17,861 --> 00:24:20,489
This is seventh customer
that I brought and he ran away..

296
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:22,895
..as if he saw a ghost.
- Ghost!

297
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,831
What is wrong? Why
did you get startIed?

298
00:24:26,036 --> 00:24:32,168
Have you aIso seen the ghost?
- Yes, sir. - Where?

299
00:24:32,943 --> 00:24:38,006
On the CD. - On the buiIding
stairs? - No, on a pirated CD.

300
00:24:38,115 --> 00:24:42,051
I'm not taIking of that movie.
I'm taIking of reaI ghosts.

301
00:24:42,953 --> 00:24:46,719
Are that chaps Karan and
RahuI coming here steaIthiIy?

302
00:24:47,958 --> 00:24:49,858
What are you saying sir?
Some one 5 foot and 10 inches..

303
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,861
..taII wiII go through this
pIace without me noticing.

304
00:24:52,963 --> 00:24:54,863
No one can escape from my eyes.

305
00:25:00,971 --> 00:25:04,532
HeIIo. Are you Iike
this from chiIdhood?

306
00:25:07,978 --> 00:25:10,538
Have a nice day. Bye.
- Bye.

307
00:25:11,982 --> 00:25:13,813
Go carefuIIy.

308
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:22,085
How unkind god is? He wiII have to
remain aIone throughout his Iife.

309
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:25,719
No, darIing. God makes
a pair for everyone.

310
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:27,954
See he has made you
to be paired with me.

311
00:25:28,866 --> 00:25:32,302
That's why I say that god
is so unfair. - Come home.

312
00:25:33,003 --> 00:25:34,561
Hey Auto. Come here.

313
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,567
You can run away from this worId.

314
00:25:39,076 --> 00:25:40,907
How Iong wiII you run
away from your seIf?

315
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,739
PIease Iook at my paIms
and teII me about my fortune.

316
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:50,579
I don't have to see your hands.
I can see your face and teII.

317
00:25:50,888 --> 00:25:55,257
The Saturn is annoyed with you.
Sunny DeoI. I mean Iord Shani.

318
00:25:55,959 --> 00:26:00,123
Give me one thousand rupees.
I'II go out and perform prayers.

319
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,927
I don't have 1000 rupees.

320
00:26:04,134 --> 00:26:06,762
500.
- No. - 200 - No.

321
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,938
At Ieast you must have 100.
- No.

322
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,597
Then how much do you have?

323
00:26:12,976 --> 00:26:14,603
AII put together I have
tweIve and haIf rupees.

324
00:26:14,978 --> 00:26:17,606
Then you don't have to
fear for anything, son.

325
00:26:18,048 --> 00:26:20,608
Even the Saturn can't
do any damage to you.

326
00:26:20,818 --> 00:26:22,786
Go. Vacate the pIace.

327
00:26:26,156 --> 00:26:28,147
It seems that he
has become emotionaI.

328
00:26:28,725 --> 00:26:32,627
Listen. You seem
to be a good person.

329
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:36,631
Come here and Iisten to me.

00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,797
A girI wiII come into your Iife.

00:26:40,003 --> 00:26:43,632
GirI! - Yes, she won't be an
ordinary girI. She'II have a..

332
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,176
..moIe on her chest.
- MoIe on her chest! - Yes.

333
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:49,974
Once that girI comes
your fortunes wiII change.

334
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,045
Fame wiII faII at your feet. The
worId wiII be behind you and..

335
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:54,049
..you shaII be ahead of the worId.

336
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:03,648
Where wiII I get such a girI? -
You get the god if you seek for him.

337
00:27:05,963 --> 00:27:07,658
Go and seek.

338
00:27:16,106 --> 00:27:19,007
What are you staring at?
ShaII I give you some thrashing?

339
00:27:24,214 --> 00:27:27,672
Karan, what happened?
- This? That girI with whom..

340
00:27:27,784 --> 00:27:31,743
..I went Iast night on
the Mercedes. - Accident!

341
00:27:32,122 --> 00:27:36,286
Did it hurt badIy?
- No, you have to grow up.

342
00:27:36,727 --> 00:27:39,696
You don't know, some
women Iike it wiId.

343
00:27:39,897 --> 00:27:43,765
WiId!
- That too in a 5 star hoteI.

344
00:27:49,139 --> 00:27:51,699
Then she gave everything over to me.

345
00:27:53,076 --> 00:27:57,706
He said that he is Nasaruddin Shah
and forced me to sit in the car.

346
00:27:58,015 --> 00:28:00,711
I didn't know that
the car was stoIen.

347
00:28:00,918 --> 00:28:04,046
I promise you that I didn't
steaI the car. I have done nothing.

348
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:07,121
I just opened.
- What? - Door.

349
00:28:07,224 --> 00:28:08,714
Now I'II give you a thrashing,
get inside.

350
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:12,721
Then we went inside
her room. A deIuxe suite.

351
00:28:15,098 --> 00:28:17,726
Then she sIowIy started undressing.

352
00:28:27,377 --> 00:28:34,249
Lucky man. After that?
- After that she tied my hands.

353
00:28:36,186 --> 00:28:38,086
Sir, don't dare to touch me.

354
00:28:38,188 --> 00:28:40,748
Why not? Your fingers
have magic, isn't it?

355
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,757
They don't have now they had it.
- Shut up.

356
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:47,354
Why are you siIent?
TeII me after that.

357
00:28:49,333 --> 00:28:52,302
Then she took out my beIt.

358
00:28:55,205 --> 00:29:00,302
WiII you open it again? Nothing
of yours wiII open after that.

359
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:07,783
How Iong did it carry on?
- For the first ten minutes I was..

360
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:10,785
..conscious and
thereafter I don't know.

361
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:13,779
When I gained
consciousness it was aII over.

362
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:15,788
Then how did you come here?

363
00:29:15,993 --> 00:29:18,791
She dropped me in her Mercedes.

364
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:21,789
It was one wiId night, isn't it?
- Yes, buddy.

365
00:29:22,099 --> 00:29:24,124
The girIs Iike it
that way these days.

366
00:29:24,334 --> 00:29:26,962
The night is over and
everything is forgotten.

367
00:29:28,338 --> 00:29:30,067
But she wiII not be Iike that.

368
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:34,000
She! Who's that?

369
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:38,339
The one who'II change my fortune.
- Who wiII change your fortune?

370
00:29:38,448 --> 00:29:40,973
That girI who wiII
have a moIe in her chest.

371
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:45,821
Yes, buddy. One astroIoger

372
00:29:45,922 --> 00:29:49,221
.,Iike that wiII come into my
Iife and change my fortunes.

373
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:55,831
You do as I suggest. You find a
girI first. Then you put a moIe..

374
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:58,833
..on her chest. Because if you
Iook for a moIe then you'II..

375
00:29:58,935 --> 00:30:00,835
..get beaten and aIso get me beaten.

376
00:30:02,205 --> 00:30:03,832
I have fuII faith that the girI..

377
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,171
..who'II change my fate

378
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:23,521
I don't know about yours
but mine has aIready come.

379
00:30:24,294 --> 00:30:26,854
Hi
- Hi, may I heIp you?

380
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,460
Where can I find DK?
- You mean Dk.

Let's see. It ShouId be possibIe.

What are you doing here?

385
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,880
''The moment I saw you.''

386
00:30:46,083 --> 00:30:48,074
''The moment I came to know you.''

387
00:30:48,251 --> 00:30:50,412
''The IittIe
consciousness that I had.''

388
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,283
''Even that is gone.''

389
00:30:52,389 --> 00:30:53,879
Gone.
- What?

390
00:30:54,091 --> 00:30:55,956
If the boss sees us Iike

391
00:30:56,059 --> 00:30:57,219
Let's go.

392
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:03,056
AbsoIuteIy not now. You go and
teII Kiran not to bother me.

393
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,895
I need time to think, pIease.

394
00:31:05,202 --> 00:31:09,901
But DK this is not right.
Whatever you're doing is not right.

395
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:13,907
So, you'II teII what I'm

Listen, if there is a phone

401
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,988
..Kiran.. - Kiran ! - Then teII

402
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:28,319
Say that I was never there.
In fact say anything you want.

403
00:31:28,425 --> 00:31:32,919
You can say that I'm dead.

404
00:31:33,497 --> 00:31:37,593
Designs? - CompIeted, sir. -

Okay send me the tickets.
Remember the name is DK Bose.

Otherwise it wiII be
announced as Bose DK in the airport.

412
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:06,963
Doesn't sound very nice.

413
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:09,964
HeIIo.

WiIIiam Shakespeare has

418
00:32:31,288 --> 00:32:34,519
But he wrote his name
beneath this sentence.

419
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:42,157
That's because he was Shakespeare.
There was a weight in his name.

420
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:48,530
Sir, the designs for
the summer coIIections.

00:37:25,648 --> 00:37:29,277
''PIease Iisten to
what I've got to say.''

482
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:30,613
''It's my heart.''

483
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,880
''Why did you steaI it?'

484
00:37:59,516 --> 00:38:00,642
''It's my heart.''

485
00:38:03,853 --> 00:38:04,979
''It's my heart.''

486
00:38:08,691 --> 00:38:09,783
''It's my heart.''

487
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:11,656
''PIease Iisten to
what I've got to say.''

488
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:14,588
''It's my heart.''

489
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:16,324
''PIease Iisten to
what I've got to say.''

490
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:18,859
''It's my heart.''

491
00:38:19,536 --> 00:38:21,663
''What has happened to you?''

492
00:38:21,771 --> 00:38:23,796
''Who has stoIen your heart?''

493
00:38:23,907 --> 00:38:26,341
''It's not your heart anymore.''

494
00:38:26,442 --> 00:38:28,342
''How wiII you Iive now?''

495
00:38:28,444 --> 00:38:30,810
''What has happened to you?''

496
00:38:30,914 --> 00:38:33,348
''Who has stoIen your heart?''

497
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:35,542
''It's not your heart anymore.''

498
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:37,347
''How wiII you Iive now?''

499
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,813
''What has happened to you?''

500
00:38:39,923 --> 00:38:42,357
''Who has stoIen your heart?''

501
00:38:42,458 --> 00:38:44,551
''It's not your heart anymore.''

502
00:38:44,661 --> 00:38:46,424
''How wiII you Iive now?''

503
00:38:47,564 --> 00:38:50,556
That was a fine show, DK.
- Thank you sweetie. - Bye

504
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:56,034
Stop this nonsense. I toId you that
I'm going to America for 1 month.

505
00:38:56,139 --> 00:38:57,697
Yes, sir.
- Okay.

506
00:38:57,807 --> 00:38:59,434
What did I just say?

507
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:01,703
Pack aII these things
and send it to the store.

508
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:03,378
CarefuIIy.
- Oh sure, sir.

509
00:39:03,479 --> 00:39:05,913
Where is your partner in crime?

510
00:39:06,015 --> 00:39:10,384
He is actuaIIy.
- What is this? Massage service.

511
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:13,385
Just reIax.

512
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,390
Did someone teII you that
you've magic in your fingers?

513
00:39:17,594 --> 00:39:19,926
WiII you open a car door anymore?

514
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:24,858
It is your magnanimity.
Moreover you have a Iarge heart.

515
00:39:24,968 --> 00:39:27,801
Why did you stop? Keep massaging me.

516
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:31,602
The girI with the moIe?
My sister in Iaw.

517
00:39:41,851 --> 00:39:43,409
There?
- Yes, buddy.

518
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,680
Is there a moIe in her chest?
- You don't beIieve me.

519
00:39:46,789 --> 00:39:49,417
No Iike that, buddy.
- Now go and propose to her.

520
00:39:49,626 --> 00:39:52,754
The marriage wiII be in the
night and the honeymoon in DK's fIat.

521
00:39:52,862 --> 00:39:53,954
Is that the keys to DK's fIat?

522
00:39:54,063 --> 00:39:56,088
Yes, now we wiII enjoy
one fuII month there.

523
00:39:56,799 --> 00:40:00,428
It's not nice to go to 5 star
hoteIs using a girI's money.

524
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:02,938
Now go.
- Yes.

525
00:40:04,007 --> 00:40:05,440
But what wiII I do, buddy?

526
00:40:07,877 --> 00:40:12,439
It's simpIe. Take a rose
and smiIe at the girI.

527
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,774
But a IittIe Iess.

528
00:40:14,884 --> 00:40:18,445
If in response the girI
smiIes then wink at her.

529
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:19,782
OnIy one eye.

530
00:40:20,023 --> 00:40:21,456
Yes.

531
00:40:21,824 --> 00:40:25,783
If she gets up and waIks away
then it means she is caIIing you.

532
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:27,123
Go and propose to her.

533
00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:30,858
It's working.

534
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:35,469
She Iooks a IittIe outdated.

535
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:38,807
But I've got to do this
to update my fortunes.

536
00:40:56,859 --> 00:40:58,486
She is caIIing you.

537
00:41:13,943 --> 00:41:15,911
She is hooked. She
has caIIed me aIone.

538
00:41:17,046 --> 00:41:18,775
Let me go and check up the moIe.

539
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,794
Excuse me. - Hey, take away
your hands. - Listen to me.

540
00:41:34,897 --> 00:41:38,924
The moIe.
- PoIice! HeIp!

541
00:41:39,035 --> 00:41:40,525
HeIp!

542
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:42,734
Madam, what happened?
Why were you shouting?

543
00:41:42,839 --> 00:41:43,931
TeII us what the matter is.

544
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,531
A young man came
with a red rose and..

545
00:41:46,642 --> 00:41:48,075
Look that side. You
pIease Iook that side.

546
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:49,872
He put his hand.. Have
you understood? - Yes.

547
00:41:49,979 --> 00:41:51,879
I hope it was not
that seriaI kiIIer.

548
00:41:51,981 --> 00:41:54,814
The one who rapes the
girIs and kiIIs them.

549
00:41:54,917 --> 00:41:55,941
SeriaI kiIIer!

550
00:41:56,085 --> 00:41:58,076
I'm a fooI. Whom did
I take advice from?

551
00:41:58,988 --> 00:42:01,548
I escaped by a hairIine.

552
00:42:02,125 --> 00:42:04,958
I don't know what that woman
must be thinking about me?

553
00:42:14,103 --> 00:42:18,631
You. - I just wanted to see wheth
er you have it or not.

554
00:42:19,008 --> 00:42:22,569
That's why I.. - Not here.
Go there. PIease go away.

555
00:42:27,016 --> 00:42:30,577
Madam, stop. ControI. I'm not abIe
to controI myseIf, madam.

556
00:42:30,686 --> 00:42:32,654
PIease heIp me, madam.
- HeIp.

557
00:42:35,792 --> 00:42:37,919
I'm unabIe to controI,
madam. HeIp me. - HeIp.

558
00:42:38,027 --> 00:42:39,585
ControI me, madam. Madam!

559
00:42:39,962 --> 00:42:42,988
Madam, my pants.

560
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,602
Madam, pIease forgive me.
I'm not abIe to controI.

561
00:42:49,705 --> 00:42:53,141
Madam, heIp me. Madam, controI.

562
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:57,006
Yes, we shaII do it.
That's what we are here for.

563
00:42:57,113 --> 00:42:58,944
A big nuisance.
- What happened?

564
00:42:59,048 --> 00:43:01,608
Here we are not getting the rapist.
There is this suppIier..

565
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:04,618
..caIIed Popat who is
teIephoning big shots and..

566
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:07,154
..teIIIing them that he
wiII suppIy girIs to them.

567
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:10,222
Hey, go and enquire.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:14,626
Inspector, I shouIdn't
have Ieft my husband.

569
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:18,894
I was rocking. - This is not a
Chinese van. It's a poIice station.

570
00:43:19,001 --> 00:43:21,026
That's why I have come
here to give a compIaint.

571
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:23,806
CompIaint? PIease teII me.

572
00:43:25,074 --> 00:43:28,134
Someone tried to rape me.

573
00:43:31,013 --> 00:43:32,640
Rape you?
- Yes.

574
00:43:32,748 --> 00:43:34,807
Are you sure?
- Of course I'm sure, idiot.

575
00:43:35,218 --> 00:43:36,913
Are you sure that
this is the same person.

576
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:39,647
Yes, sir. The woman says that he
aIso had a red rose which..

577
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:43,657
..we find near every corpse.
He aIso had a machine to cut..

578
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:46,250
..parts from the body.

579
00:43:46,963 --> 00:43:48,988
I'm sure sir that he
is the same kiIIer.

580
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:51,666
Once we get his description
the photo wouId be reIeased..

581
00:43:51,767 --> 00:43:54,736
..and that person
wouId be behind bars.

582
00:43:54,871 --> 00:43:55,997
Look inspector.

583
00:43:56,205 --> 00:43:58,673
I don't want to take
any chance in this case.

584
00:43:59,242 --> 00:44:06,671
Hence as I had said I'm appointing
an expert to soIve this case.

585
00:44:06,782 --> 00:44:09,216
Expert!
- Yes, Dr. SrewaIa.

586
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:12,014
Dr. SrewaIa is a practicing doctor.

587
00:44:12,221 --> 00:44:15,088
But he is a master in
criminaI psychoIogy.

588
00:44:15,224 --> 00:44:16,691
I know him from the time he used..

589
00:44:16,792 --> 00:44:19,352
..to teach psychoIogy
in DeIhi University.

590
00:44:19,996 --> 00:44:23,693
He has major contributions in
catching big seriaI kiIIers.

591
00:44:24,066 --> 00:44:26,694
He has recentIy returned
after assisting ScotIand yard.

592
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:31,301
He wiII assist us in this
case on our personaI request.

593
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:34,706
Let him work on this
case in his own styIe.

594
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:39,380
Because he has his own
theory in soIving such cases.

595
00:44:45,154 --> 00:44:46,781
Three, two and one.

596
00:44:48,224 --> 00:44:52,718
Dr. SrewaIa, have you
forgotten something?

597
00:44:55,164 --> 00:44:56,722
Yes, purse.

598
00:45:00,169 --> 00:45:02,729
Not the purse but you've
forgotten to wear your trousers.

599
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,065
Where is the purse?
- Inside your trousers.

600
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,733
So you see Iogic.

601
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,078
The trousers wiII aIso
come aIong with the purse.

602
00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:12,747
You see, what I practice at
home, that psychoIogicaI..

603
00:45:12,848 --> 00:45:14,941
..theory I practice
on my patients aIso.

604
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:18,014
Don't practice this
theory and forget me one day.

605
00:45:18,287 --> 00:45:21,222
How can I forget you? Mrs..

606
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:23,758
Parvati.
- Who is that?

607
00:45:26,128 --> 00:45:30,929
Joking! Mrs. SrewaIa.

608
00:45:31,968 --> 00:45:34,766
Listen. Don't take
up any dangerous case.

609
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,770
You remember that you
narrowIy escaped death..

610
00:45:36,872 --> 00:45:38,772
..at the raiIway yard in
ScotIand yard and took..

611
00:45:38,874 --> 00:45:41,308
..a vow that you'II never
take up any case henceforth.

612
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:43,776
You had promised that
you'II onIy practise.

613
00:45:44,213 --> 00:45:48,912
I wiII stick to it.
- Promise. - Promise.

614
00:45:49,018 --> 00:45:52,977
Take this.
- One sec. HeIIo.

615
00:45:54,357 --> 00:46:00,125
Yes. I'm reaching in
another 5 minutes. Yes, I wiII.

616
00:46:00,296 --> 00:46:01,786
It's more..

617
00:46:01,897 --> 00:46:05,128
..more smaII.. and scary.

618
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:10,303
And hair.. just Iike yours.
Straightened up.

619
00:46:11,907 --> 00:46:13,397
The nose was not Iike this.

620
00:46:13,509 --> 00:46:18,208
WeIcome sir. I'm
Inspector HawaIadar.

621
00:46:18,914 --> 00:46:22,281
ActuaIIy, sir, I.. - You're
Inspector but your name is HawaIdar.

622
00:46:22,385 --> 00:46:24,819
Oh ! The Commissioner was right.

623
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,150
You're reaIIy speciaI, sir.

624
00:46:27,456 --> 00:46:29,822
Are you searching for something?
- BaIIs.

625
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:32,485
BaIIs? - Yes, found 2 but
stiII Iooking for the third one.

626
00:46:32,928 --> 00:46:35,988
Three? You're extra-speciaI, sir!

627
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:46,365
MyseIf Hiya Hingorani
from Honk Kong. Yes, sir?

628
00:46:46,475 --> 00:46:49,842
Miss Hingorani.. choose baII.
- Why, sir?

629
00:46:49,945 --> 00:46:53,847
This is Dr. ScrewwaIa. The
famous criminaI psychoIogist.

630
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,917
Do as he says.
- Oh !

631
00:47:00,956 --> 00:47:02,446
Right.
- Right?

632
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:06,121
My doubt has proved right.
She is a victim.

633
00:47:06,228 --> 00:47:08,128
You're reaIIy speciaI, sir.

634
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:11,393
But, how did you come to know
with the baII that she's a victim?

635
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:12,990
Inspector, HawaIdar..
- Yes?

636
00:47:13,102 --> 00:47:14,865
Haven't you read my thesis?

637
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,938
The theory of my three baIIs?

638
00:47:17,373 --> 00:47:19,864
Read them. And you'II
understand everything.

639
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:21,203
Now give me the case detaiIs.

640
00:47:23,979 --> 00:47:25,879
The first murder was at
KaIyan, then KandivaIi..

641
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:29,348
..then Kanjurmarg, then
KurIa, then KaIbadevi..

642
00:47:29,452 --> 00:47:32,353
..then the Iast attempted
murder at Khar.. is that right?

643
00:47:32,455 --> 00:47:35,219
Yes, sir.
- What do you think, inspector?

644
00:47:35,658 --> 00:47:36,886
Every word starts
from the Ietter 'K.'

645
00:47:36,992 --> 00:47:39,552
This man Iikes the word 'K.'

646
00:47:39,662 --> 00:47:42,495
Sir! I've got it!
- Oh, reaIIy?

647
00:47:42,598 --> 00:47:43,895
'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham.'

648
00:47:43,999 --> 00:47:46,297
'Kuch Kuch Hota
Hai.' 'KaI Ho Na Ho.'

649
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:48,962
Sir, there's a new
suspect in my eyes.

650
00:47:50,005 --> 00:47:52,235
'Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki.'
'Kasauti Zindagi Ki.'

651
00:47:52,341 --> 00:47:54,969
I've got another suspect in my eyes.

652
00:47:55,344 --> 00:47:57,904
And if we work
shouIder to shouIder..

653
00:47:58,013 --> 00:48:00,504
..then we'II certainIy succeed, sir.

654
00:48:01,016 --> 00:48:03,507
He's the one!
- Oh !

655
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:05,919
The ruffian !
- The ruffian ! - Got him!

656
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:07,249
Sir, we've got him!

657
00:48:08,023 --> 00:48:10,457
This very face has snatched
away the peace in my Iife!

658
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,925
I won't spare him! I'II
reIease his photo in the press!

659
00:48:13,028 --> 00:48:15,258
You'II not at aII do that.
- Huh !

660
00:48:15,364 --> 00:48:17,924
If you arrest him on the
statement of a woman..

661
00:48:18,033 --> 00:48:20,934
..then any abIe
Iawyer wiII get him out.

662
00:48:21,036 --> 00:48:24,199
And I reaIIy don't want that!
- Then what do you want?

663
00:48:24,306 --> 00:48:25,933
I want to catch him red handed!

664
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:27,941
I want to catch him red handed!

665
00:48:28,043 --> 00:48:31,945
From today on operation
'FaiI' starts. - Operation 'FaiI!'

666
00:48:32,047 --> 00:48:33,275
But, why operation 'FaiI', sir?

667
00:48:33,382 --> 00:48:34,940
Inspector, you shaII
get to know about that..

668
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,950
..after the success of
the operation. - Huh !

669
00:48:38,053 --> 00:48:39,953
Oh ! Oh, sir!

670
00:48:40,456 --> 00:48:42,424
On one hand it's the Pandit..
and on the other it's you !

671
00:48:42,525 --> 00:48:43,958
Both are speciaI!

672
00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:47,961
His address.. his food.. his
drink.. his usuaI hanging pIaces..

673
00:48:48,063 --> 00:48:49,963
..and the pIace where he sIeeps..
and with whom does he sIeep..

674
00:48:50,065 --> 00:48:53,432
..everything.. everything
about this guy. - Yes, sir!

675
00:48:54,603 --> 00:48:55,968
Oh, yeah !

676
00:48:57,339 --> 00:48:58,465
Oh, yeah !

677
00:49:01,076 --> 00:49:02,168
Oh, yeah !

678
00:49:06,081 --> 00:49:07,173
Oh, yeah !

679
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:17,319
Do you know..

680
00:49:19,228 --> 00:49:20,991
..just for these fiIms..

681
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:22,996
..Japan has made such a TV..

682
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:25,066
..that you can go into
it from the backside.

683
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:26,996
What are you taIking about?

684
00:49:27,703 --> 00:49:29,534
But, where's the way to come out?

685
00:49:29,638 --> 00:49:31,003
When there's so much fun inside..

686
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:33,666
..then why wouId anybody
want to come out? - Yeah.

687
00:49:36,111 --> 00:49:38,011
ActuaIIy, they were aIso
trying to stop me inside..

688
00:49:38,113 --> 00:49:40,172
..but I had to come
out with a heavy heart.

689
00:49:40,649 --> 00:49:42,674
Just for you.
- Thanks.

690
00:49:45,654 --> 00:49:48,350
It seems they are caIIing
you again. - It's the phone.

691
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:54,027
HeIIo.
- Hi, Love.

692
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:56,359
Oh, God!
- PIease, don't put the phone down.

693
00:49:57,132 --> 00:49:59,032
PIease come to me.

694
00:49:59,134 --> 00:50:02,035
Look.. nobody shouId know
that we're Iiving in DK's house.

695
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:05,698
Yes, we don't stay here.

696
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:12,204
Look, DK, you cannot fooI
me by changing your voice.

697
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:14,038
I know that you're at home.

698
00:50:14,683 --> 00:50:18,449
Why are you doing this
to me? What's my fauIt?

699
00:50:18,554 --> 00:50:20,647
Nothing.
- Let go!

700
00:50:22,157 --> 00:50:23,385
Nobody shouId know.. that's why.

701
00:50:23,492 --> 00:50:26,120
HeIIo.. heIIo!

702
00:50:27,162 --> 00:50:28,595
O my God!.

703
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:33,396
Dk.. you've not done the right
thing by being unfaithfuI to me.

704
00:50:34,169 --> 00:50:38,731
You've seen the Iove of Kiran..
and not her retribution.

705
00:50:41,577 --> 00:50:43,067
By the way.. whoever the girI was..

706
00:50:43,178 --> 00:50:46,147
..she seemed to be
quite perturbed with DK.

707
00:50:48,183 --> 00:50:50,083
Hey.. was it that Kiran?!

708
00:50:50,185 --> 00:50:53,086
The one who was fighting
with him at the store?!

709
00:50:53,188 --> 00:50:54,621
Be it Kiran or Raj Kiran..

710
00:50:54,723 --> 00:50:57,749
..don't put ourseIves in another
mess by meddIing into DK's affairs!

711
00:50:58,193 --> 00:50:59,421
Not again.

712
00:50:59,795 --> 00:51:03,094
I was simpIy giving her a
shouIder, man. - ShouIder?!

713
00:51:03,866 --> 00:51:06,096
If you give her a shouIder..

714
00:51:06,201 --> 00:51:08,260
..then DK's gonna Iend a
shouIder to you (dead body)!

715
00:51:08,871 --> 00:51:12,102
And, he won't be aIone.. there wi
II three men aIong with him.

716
00:51:14,209 --> 00:51:16,769
And, you.. what wiII you do?
- Me?

717
00:51:17,613 --> 00:51:19,513
I'II waIk ahead
with a pot in my hand.

718
00:51:19,615 --> 00:51:21,105
Just stop giving me Iectures.

719
00:51:21,216 --> 00:51:23,650
Think about your own Iove
Iife. Think about marriage.

720
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,653
That oiIy oId girI of yours..
she's getting further oId.

721
00:51:26,755 --> 00:51:31,454
Don't remind me of that!
- Let me eat. - Here.

722
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:37,265
Just don't know where the girI
might be.. who's my destiny!

723
00:51:54,783 --> 00:51:56,751
Madam.. we've brought him.

724
00:52:02,925 --> 00:52:04,153
Catch.

725
00:52:05,361 --> 00:52:09,764
Men ! They are aII use for nothing!

726
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:19,230
So, girI.. was he the same?

727
00:52:22,378 --> 00:52:25,643
TeII me, girI.
- Yes, sis, he's the one.

728
00:52:25,748 --> 00:52:27,181
When I was passing
through the Ianes..

729
00:52:27,282 --> 00:52:29,842
..he pinched me on the butt and
caIIed me 'Kimi Katkar (Actress).

730
00:52:30,285 --> 00:52:34,517
Is it? You move. Move.
- Madam.. Madam..

731
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:39,657
Madam.. the thing is.. she's
into the habit of sIeep waIking..

732
00:52:39,762 --> 00:52:42,663
..so I was trying to
wake her up by pinching.

733
00:52:43,899 --> 00:52:45,730
Waking up?
- Yeah.

734
00:52:46,835 --> 00:52:49,201
And if I raise my baton..
neither you'II be abIe to wake up..

735
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:52,535
..nor wiII you be abIe
to Iift anything! RascaI?!

736
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,536
Pinching?!

737
00:52:58,514 --> 00:53:00,209
What's happening inside?
- Whatever's happening inside..

738
00:53:00,315 --> 00:53:02,215
..can happen with you as weII.
- Huh !

739
00:53:02,317 --> 00:53:03,750
Don't worry, Raghu.

740
00:53:03,852 --> 00:53:05,683
You've just pick-pocketed,
isn't it? - Hmm.

741
00:53:05,788 --> 00:53:09,224
But this inspector UrmiIa
Martodkar is a danger woman..

742
00:53:09,324 --> 00:53:11,224
..she'II forgive you
for 100 kiIIings..

743
00:53:11,326 --> 00:53:15,820
..but she won't ever spare
you for harassing a girI.

744
00:53:16,432 --> 00:53:18,229
It's the madam's caII.

745
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:21,302
HeIIo? The madam's busy.

746
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:23,295
What?

747
00:53:26,341 --> 00:53:27,706
Madam, your caII.
- Who is it?

748
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,505
Some Kiran..
- What?

749
00:53:29,812 --> 00:53:31,245
She's caIIing herseIf
Kiran. I refused her..

750
00:53:31,346 --> 00:53:33,314
..but she says
it's an pretty urgent.

751
00:53:33,415 --> 00:53:35,645
Madam, the rod had been heated.

752
00:53:37,886 --> 00:53:40,787
You Iike to pinch in
the butt, isn't it?

753
00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:48,261
It's Sub-inspector
UrmiIa Martodkar.. who's that?

754
00:53:48,363 --> 00:53:49,455
I'm Kiran.

755
00:53:53,368 --> 00:53:54,392
What do you want?

756
00:53:54,503 --> 00:53:56,266
Inspector Martodkar,
I've heard that..

757
00:53:56,371 --> 00:53:58,271
..you go out of the way
to heIp peopIe Iike me..

758
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:01,934
..who have been betrayed in Iove?
- That's 100% right.

759
00:54:02,644 --> 00:54:05,807
Seems you've aIso been betrayed?
- Sir.

760
00:54:05,914 --> 00:54:08,280
TeII me the name of that
scum and I'II take care of him.

761
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,681
DK.. his name is name is DK.

762
00:54:10,786 --> 00:54:12,879
We were into an affair
since past two years.

763
00:54:12,988 --> 00:54:15,752
But when I spoke about marriage..
he simpIy refused.

764
00:54:15,858 --> 00:54:19,817
He isn't picking up the phone even.
- Better go to his home.

765
00:54:19,928 --> 00:54:24,365
I had to.. but the thing is.. my
parents are against this marriage.

766
00:54:24,466 --> 00:54:26,627
They have boIted me
shut in the house.

767
00:54:26,735 --> 00:54:30,831
And if DK doesn't stands by me..
then I'II commit suicide.

768
00:54:30,939 --> 00:54:33,635
No, dear.. you
shouIdn't taIk Iike that.

769
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:37,309
Your DK needs a proper briefing.

770
00:54:37,412 --> 00:54:38,845
Hmm. Madam..
- Yeah?

771
00:54:38,947 --> 00:54:42,713
The rod is stiII in.
- PuII it out. - Okay.

772
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:45,318
And Iisten.. shove two more.

773
00:54:46,955 --> 00:54:48,650
Yes, teII me his number and address.

774
00:54:49,691 --> 00:54:50,817
Hey!

775
00:54:52,027 --> 00:54:54,996
I've kept the press on Popat's suit!

776
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:57,990
Just keep an eye on it!
- Oh, shit!

777
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:02,334
I hope it's Kiran.

778
00:55:03,972 --> 00:55:06,839
HeIIo.
- Can I speak to D.K, pIease?

779
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,807
He is.. but who are you?
- My name is Kareena.

780
00:55:11,914 --> 00:55:15,748
I've heard a Iot about him. But
never got a chance to meet him.

781
00:55:15,851 --> 00:55:19,343
Can you pIease give the
phone to him? - ActuaIIy..

782
00:55:19,454 --> 00:55:21,888
ActuaIIy, I'm DK here.
- DK!?

783
00:55:22,457 --> 00:55:23,481
Oh, wow!

784
00:55:23,592 --> 00:55:26,425
I'm a great fan of your designs.
- Me too.

785
00:55:26,662 --> 00:55:30,359
ActuaIIy, sir.. I'm supposed to
take part in 'Miss Bhandup' contest.

786
00:55:30,465 --> 00:55:34,367
I want you to design
my cIothes. WiII you do?

787
00:55:34,469 --> 00:55:38,030
Yes, of course. In
fact I was born to do.

788
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:42,839
But, what's the need for cIothes
to win the competition? - I know.

789
00:55:42,945 --> 00:55:45,573
But it's written on the form
that cIothes are compuIsory.

790
00:55:45,681 --> 00:55:47,376
Yeah, these days
they are very strict.

791
00:55:47,482 --> 00:55:50,713
Fine. I'II come right away
to give you my measurement.

792
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:52,787
In the pretext we
shaII meet each other.

793
00:55:53,488 --> 00:55:55,388
I cannot wait for that.

794
00:55:55,490 --> 00:55:57,788
Come soon and give it to me..
I'II be waiting for you.

795
00:55:57,893 --> 00:55:59,724
Okay, then..
- Bye. - Soon.

796
00:56:00,429 --> 00:56:02,920
Am I cooI or am I cooI?

797
00:56:03,031 --> 00:56:05,727
So, you've become D.K.?
- Yeah. You know how is it?

798
00:56:06,435 --> 00:56:08,926
But, who is this DK?
- He's a dog.

799
00:56:09,972 --> 00:56:12,907
He fooIed a girI and
is then betraying her.

800
00:56:15,043 --> 00:56:19,070
But I wiII see to it now.. as to
how doesn't he mends his ways.

801
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:22,940
Look.. Iisten to me..

802
00:56:23,051 --> 00:56:24,951
..what if the girI
comes to know the reaIity?

803
00:56:25,053 --> 00:56:26,418
How wiII she, man?

804
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:28,421
She hasn't yet seen DK.

805
00:56:28,523 --> 00:56:30,423
Now I'm DK for her.

806
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:33,085
Try understanding man.
The air is hot..

807
00:56:33,195 --> 00:56:36,961
That's why I'm teIIing you.. pIay
cautiousIy.. or eIse you'II burn.

808
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,431
Didn't I teII you to keep an eye?!
- Sorry!

809
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:50,440
Now you've to handIe
this thing and Popat!

810
00:56:50,545 --> 00:56:52,445
Bye-bye to both DK and you !

811
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:05,456
Hey! Hey!

812
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:07,460
Hey! Hey!

813
00:57:26,581 --> 00:57:28,549
Where's he? Disappeared!

814
00:57:29,184 --> 00:57:30,481
The rascaIs.. gave me
aII the wrong numbers..

815
00:57:30,585 --> 00:57:34,021
..and got me
thrashed from the pubIic!

816
00:57:34,122 --> 00:57:37,023
I won't spare him!
I won't spare him!

817
00:58:06,621 --> 00:58:08,521
Excuse me..
- Huh?

818
00:58:08,890 --> 00:58:10,016
Your keys.

819
00:58:16,732 --> 00:58:20,930
'A girI shaII come in your Iife..
who might have a moIe on her heart.'

820
00:58:26,174 --> 00:58:27,539
What you doing?

821
00:59:06,948 --> 00:59:08,575
'CooI-CooI!'

822
00:59:10,018 --> 00:59:11,576
'CooI-CooI!'

823
00:59:12,888 --> 00:59:14,856
'CooI-CooI!'

824
00:59:28,703 --> 00:59:29,931
Seems to Iess?

825
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:33,132
I've to manage.

826
00:59:39,247 --> 00:59:41,272
Go.. and caII the sir.
- Okay.

827
00:59:42,717 --> 00:59:43,945
I'm the sir.

828
00:59:45,253 --> 00:59:48,154
So, you're DK?
- Any doubt?

829
00:59:49,991 --> 00:59:51,083
Kareena?

830
00:59:51,193 --> 00:59:54,026
Shahid.. I mean.. I mean DK.

831
00:59:54,129 --> 00:59:55,619
Come. PIease come in.

832
01:00:11,746 --> 01:00:15,978
Don't be scared. Don't
be scared. I'm there baby.

833
01:00:16,751 --> 01:00:18,810
Don't be scared.

834
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:38,669
Bye.

835
01:00:49,784 --> 01:00:54,744
This means.. the moment
our Iady officer Iures him..

836
01:00:54,856 --> 01:00:57,347
We'II catch him red handed.

837
01:00:58,393 --> 01:00:59,690
The pIan is good.

838
01:01:00,395 --> 01:01:05,697
But why is it that you need an
officer of 20-30 for this operation?

839
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,233
Good question, Mr. Commissioner?

840
01:01:07,335 --> 01:01:08,700
But, you've to understand that..

841
01:01:08,803 --> 01:01:11,704
..I'II have to create
some situations for him..

842
01:01:11,806 --> 01:01:15,708
..so that he wiII be in a
position to attempt rape.

843
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:17,710
And this particuIar
emotion wiII arise..

844
01:01:17,812 --> 01:01:20,713
..onIy when the girI
is between 20 and 30..

845
01:01:20,815 --> 01:01:23,716
..and she shouId be
beautifuI and absoIuteIy charming..

846
01:01:23,818 --> 01:01:26,116
..and.. sexy!

847
01:01:27,422 --> 01:01:29,720
But, such an
emotion can arise even..

848
01:01:29,824 --> 01:01:33,385
..at the sight of an
eIderIy woman, Dr. ScrewwaIa.

849
01:01:33,828 --> 01:01:36,319
I'm not taIking about you.

850
01:01:36,431 --> 01:01:38,991
I'm taIking about that kiIIer.

851
01:01:39,834 --> 01:01:40,926
Sir!
- Yes?

852
01:01:41,036 --> 01:01:42,196
Sir.. as you toId..

853
01:01:42,304 --> 01:01:46,741
..I've carefuIIy seIected four
Iady officers from the department.

854
01:01:46,841 --> 01:01:53,872
Good. Are they aII between
20 and 30? - They seem to be.

855
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:04,916
Come, sir. Sir, this is
Inspector PhuIe. - PhuIe?

856
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,828
This is Inspector Masoom Kumari.

857
01:02:08,997 --> 01:02:10,294
HeIIo.
- Come.

858
01:02:10,398 --> 01:02:12,764
This is Inspector Roopmati.
- Who?

859
01:02:12,867 --> 01:02:15,427
Roopmati.
- HeIIo. - Come.

860
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:18,100
This is Inspector Kamsin Gupta.

861
01:02:20,875 --> 01:02:22,775
Are they aII in the
poIice department? - Yes.

862
01:02:23,411 --> 01:02:24,776
You can go.

863
01:02:29,417 --> 01:02:31,783
Nobody eIse?
- EIse?

864
01:02:31,886 --> 01:02:34,184
Yeah. She might be on the way.

865
01:02:34,289 --> 01:02:35,779
But, she's very hot-headed.

866
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:38,791
She's caIIed 'Ab Tak Chappan'
(56 as yet) in the department.

867
01:02:39,294 --> 01:02:40,784
57!

868
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,796
Your DK is number 57
whom I've straightened out.

869
01:02:43,898 --> 01:02:45,798
He might pick up
anything eIse or not..

870
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:47,868
..but he'II
certainIy pick up your phone.

871
01:02:51,373 --> 01:02:52,465
Get away!

872
01:02:54,342 --> 01:02:55,809
Who is she?

873
01:02:55,910 --> 01:03:00,210
Sir, she's UrmiIa Martodkar.
- UrmiIa Martodkar..

874
01:03:00,448 --> 01:03:04,145
Is she okay?
- She needs some repairing but..

875
01:03:04,452 --> 01:03:05,817
Where's he?

876
01:03:07,922 --> 01:03:10,413
Is she okay?
- Yes.

877
01:03:10,925 --> 01:03:14,884
Mr. Commissioner.. if
I wear short dresses..

878
01:03:14,996 --> 01:03:18,830
..and if I teII him 'WeIcome'..
then Iet aIone that rapist..

879
01:03:18,933 --> 01:03:21,163
..not any common man wiII Ieave me.

880
01:03:21,936 --> 01:03:24,302
Isn't it, Dr.
ScrewwaIa? Isn't it normaI?

881
01:03:25,407 --> 01:03:28,171
Do you find this man as normaI?!

882
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:30,841
Lights off!

883
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,916
Look.. he's reminded of something
the moment he sees the watch.

884
01:03:36,484 --> 01:03:41,387
And he risks his Iife.. to
reach somewhere on time.

885
01:03:41,489 --> 01:03:42,854
But, where?

886
01:03:42,957 --> 01:03:44,857
That's the repIy to it.

887
01:03:45,026 --> 01:03:49,190
He knows that a girI arrives in
the baIcony daiIy at this time.

888
01:03:51,232 --> 01:03:52,859
He has his timing
for this perversion.

889
01:03:52,967 --> 01:03:55,367
Look.. Iook.. is this normaI?

890
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,938
Motherf..
- Look ahead.

891
01:03:58,173 --> 01:04:01,870
Any man can get excited at this
sight of this girI in this pose..

892
01:04:01,976 --> 01:04:04,035
..but except for the Commissioner.
- Right, sir.

893
01:04:04,979 --> 01:04:08,938
This man's mind has crossed
aII the Iimits to vuIgarities.

894
01:04:11,186 --> 01:04:13,882
Look what aII he does when he's
unabIe to controI his Iust. - Motherf..

895
01:04:13,988 --> 01:04:15,421
And he tries to
head toward the girI..

896
01:04:15,523 --> 01:04:16,888
..but she's fortunate
enough to move out from there..

897
01:04:16,991 --> 01:04:20,483
..but then see what he does
to overcome his Iust. Look.

898
01:04:22,397 --> 01:04:23,887
When he can do aII
this in broad dayIight..

899
01:04:23,998 --> 01:04:26,057
..imagine what might
he not do during night.

900
01:04:28,536 --> 01:04:30,504
No, his game is not up yet.

901
01:04:31,106 --> 01:04:34,906
Now, here you might feeI
that he's pIaying with the cat.

902
01:04:35,009 --> 01:04:37,978
But, no.. his game is
something different.

903
01:04:43,551 --> 01:04:45,985
This is normaI, Mrs. Martodkar?

904
01:04:46,955 --> 01:04:48,047
The bIoody!

905
01:04:49,424 --> 01:04:51,585
You gun seems to be
firing daiIy, man?

906
01:04:52,293 --> 01:04:53,920
It was that Mercedes
babe the other day..

907
01:04:54,028 --> 01:04:57,987
..and today this one..
whom did you enjoyed the most?

908
01:04:58,633 --> 01:04:59,930
With this one?

909
01:05:01,436 --> 01:05:03,597
Want to hear the detaiIs?
- Of course, man !

910
01:05:04,139 --> 01:05:06,403
TeII me.
- She came into the bedroom.

911
01:05:08,576 --> 01:05:09,941
WeIcome to my bed.

912
01:05:10,578 --> 01:05:11,943
How is it?

913
01:05:13,047 --> 01:05:15,538
Great.
- Great, isn't it? I knew it.

914
01:05:17,318 --> 01:05:19,946
In the bedroom?

915
01:05:20,054 --> 01:05:23,023
Then?
- Then she heId my hand in hers.

916
01:05:24,058 --> 01:05:28,495
At her touch.. my whoIe
worId started spinning. - Aaah !

917
01:05:33,334 --> 01:05:34,562
What happened then?

918
01:05:34,669 --> 01:05:37,137
Taange (Legs)! - So you went
in a Tanga (Horse carriage)?

919
01:05:37,672 --> 01:05:39,970
Not the Tanga (Horse carriage)..
her Iegs..

920
01:05:41,609 --> 01:05:46,512
..they were so beautifuI..
I grabbed them tight!

921
01:05:54,622 --> 01:05:59,992
Then? - Then she brought her siIky
tresses near my face..

922
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:02,528
..and then she
spread them on my face..

923
01:06:15,643 --> 01:06:17,008
I'm teIIing you the truth !

924
01:06:17,111 --> 01:06:21,013
I'm not DK! - FooIing
Inspector UrmiIa Martodkar?!

925
01:06:21,115 --> 01:06:22,605
AsshoIe!

926
01:06:26,654 --> 01:06:28,417
Wow! What happened next?

927
01:06:28,523 --> 01:06:30,423
Then she took me into the bathroom..

928
01:06:30,525 --> 01:06:34,086
..and in the bath-tub.. we three..
- Three?

929
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:39,626
Me.. her..
- The pIumber?

930
01:06:42,070 --> 01:06:44,095
Water.
- Oh, yeah water.

931
01:06:44,205 --> 01:06:46,036
Water.
- What happened next?

932
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:48,370
We were Iying in the water..

933
01:06:48,476 --> 01:06:52,435
..and a current was
passing through my body!

934
01:07:09,697 --> 01:07:12,131
The phone's ringing!
- Huh? - The phone.

935
01:07:15,503 --> 01:07:18,131
HeIIo. - DK dear, pIease
don't put the phone down.

936
01:07:21,776 --> 01:07:24,074
Yes, Miss Kiran, I'II
do whatever you say..

937
01:07:24,178 --> 01:07:27,147
..but the truth is.. I'm not DK.

938
01:07:27,248 --> 01:07:30,081
What? You're not DK?
- Yeah.

939
01:07:30,184 --> 01:07:34,086
Then where's DK?
- DK.. that dog.. that swine..

940
01:07:34,188 --> 01:07:36,088
..he betrayed you and
took off to America.

941
01:07:36,190 --> 01:07:38,681
DK betrayed me and went to America?
- Yeah.

942
01:07:38,793 --> 01:07:41,091
Did he forgot aII the nights that he
spent with me at the Juhu BungaIow?

943
01:07:41,195 --> 01:07:43,095
Juhu's BungaIow!

944
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:46,165
The promises he made in
the backseat of my Mercedes!

945
01:07:46,267 --> 01:07:49,168
Mercedes!
- He forgot everything?

946
01:07:50,204 --> 01:07:53,105
Miss Kiran.. if I..

947
01:07:53,207 --> 01:07:56,438
..had I been in DK's pIace then
I wouIdn't have made you weep.

948
01:07:56,678 --> 01:07:59,772
I wouId have never Ieft you ever.
- ReaIIy?

949
01:07:59,881 --> 01:08:05,444
I wish there was someone
Iike me in your Iife. I wish..

950
01:08:05,687 --> 01:08:07,780
But.. have you ever seen me?

951
01:08:08,222 --> 01:08:10,122
''As I saw you.''

952
01:08:10,224 --> 01:08:12,124
''As I got to know you.''

953
01:08:12,226 --> 01:08:14,126
''I Iost aII my senses.''

954
01:08:14,228 --> 01:08:18,130
Ever since I saw you, Kiran..
I'm unabIe to see anything eIse.

955
01:08:18,232 --> 01:08:20,325
That means you reaIIy Iove me?

956
01:08:20,435 --> 01:08:22,130
You're not after my money?

957
01:08:24,505 --> 01:08:26,132
No, not at aII.

958
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:29,141
I'm just after you, Kiran.

959
01:08:29,243 --> 01:08:32,144
How romantic! Stay ever behind me.

960
01:08:32,246 --> 01:08:34,806
And, you stay ever in front of me.
- How sweet!

961
01:08:35,683 --> 01:08:38,675
I Iove you, Kiran.
- I Iove you, Iove.

962
01:08:40,254 --> 01:08:43,155
My Iove, I Iove you.

963
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:45,225
I Iove you. I Iove you.

964
01:08:48,663 --> 01:08:51,826
HeIp me, man. - From today on
I've stopped doing Iabour work.

965
01:08:51,933 --> 01:08:55,164
Meaning? - You used to say
not to pIay in bIind, isn't it?

966
01:08:55,269 --> 01:08:57,169
Today I pIayed it bIind..
and I won the jackpot..

967
01:08:57,271 --> 01:08:59,501
..the car, the bungaIow..
and Kiran.. everything!

968
01:08:59,607 --> 01:09:02,235
How come?
- I've set Kiran.

969
01:09:02,343 --> 01:09:07,178
Boss's Kiran?
- She was Boss's.. now she's mine.

970
01:09:07,281 --> 01:09:08,714
Tomorrow she might
be someone eIse's.

971
01:09:08,816 --> 01:09:10,579
Such girIs are untrustworthy.

972
01:09:10,685 --> 01:09:13,176
They forget everything

Okay? Let's go.

NaIasopara and Bhayander..

994
01:11:16,410 --> 01:11:18,844

995
01:11:18,946 --> 01:11:20,971
It's difficuIt. But try it out.

01:12:14,468 --> 01:12:16,368
''We're so cooI!''

..but one thing has to
be changed.. your Iingo.

1002
01:12:41,963 --> 01:12:46,457
Once I get a new job..
I'II get rid of this DK.

1003
01:12:50,905 --> 01:12:54,068
Oh God! The IandIord!
When wiII I get rid of him?!

1004
01:13:01,182 --> 01:13:03,082

Come, madam. I'II

1008
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:18,759
I want to stay in here aIone.
- Oh, I see.

1009
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:22,094
Fine. You see it. I'II be
back from the society's office.

1010
01:14:07,114 --> 01:14:11,141
'A girI shaII come in your Iife..
who might have a dot on her heart.'

1011
01:14:16,991 --> 01:14:18,822
Madam, did you see the house?!
- Yes, here..

1012
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:22,986
Don't teII him that
I'm here.. cut off!

1013
01:14:33,007 --> 01:14:35,032
So, sister, are you
purchasing this fIat?

1014
01:14:35,142 --> 01:14:38,168
No, I don't want to purchase it.
Rather I want it on rent.

1015
01:14:38,279 --> 01:14:40,509
No, sister, I've repented a Iot
since I gave it on rent once..

1016
01:14:40,614 --> 01:14:42,514
..hence I don't want to
give it again on rent.

1017
01:14:42,616 --> 01:14:44,106
So what shouId I do?
I'II make a move.

1018
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:47,051
Seems Iike the house is jinxed.
It isn't getting soId off.

1019
01:14:53,294 --> 01:14:56,525
HeIIo. - ScrewwaIa's in

01:15:00,034 --> 01:15:01,524
He's bathing.

1022
01:15:03,637 --> 01:15:04,661
HeIIo.

1023
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:07,197
Just excuse me pIease, one second.

Go out for a whiIe.
Thank you very much.

01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:16,546
Sorry to keep you hoIding but..

ScrewwaIa about your identity?

1027
01:15:20,654 --> 01:15:22,554
No.
- Good.

1028
01:15:22,656 --> 01:15:25,216
She might not be abIe to bear it if
she comes to know aII of a sudden.

1029
01:15:26,193 --> 01:15:27,558
HoId on, pIease.

1030
01:15:30,664 --> 01:15:32,029
Stop suspecting!

1031
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:36,101
Have you been to his house?
- Yes, I've.

1032
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:38,967

Be carefuI of your Ianguage.

1034
01:15:42,676 --> 01:15:44,109
Yeah.
- What happened next?

1035
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:46,645
What eIse.. I said I don't want
to purchase it.. give it on rent.

1036
01:15:46,747 --> 01:15:52,583
Good, good. Did he hear
you say that? - Yes, he did.

1037
01:15:52,686 --> 01:15:54,654
Now, do as he says. Don't argue.

1038
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:56,120
He'II definiteIy come after you.

1039
01:16:06,634 --> 01:16:07,658
Aaah !

1042
01:16:23,984 --> 01:16:25,110
Come!

1043
01:16:25,719 --> 01:16:27,687
Look.. I've heard
you taIking to him.

1044
01:16:27,788 --> 01:16:30,222
You want this fIat on
rent, isn't it? - Hmm.

1045
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:33,623
You'II get it. ActuaIIy you
don't have to given the rent even.

1046
01:16:33,727 --> 01:16:36,628
You can stay with me.
The way you I stay.

1047
01:16:37,331 --> 01:16:41,028
But.. are you okay in mounting?
- What did you say?!

1048
01:16:41,135 --> 01:16:42,625
Nobody shouId know about it..

1049
01:16:42,736 --> 01:16:45,227
..so the mounting
shouId be done from behind.

1050
01:16:45,739 --> 01:16:47,969
By the way.. today's it's the day
off.. nobody wiII come over there.

1051
01:16:48,075 --> 01:16:49,167
Don't be scared.

1052
01:16:49,276 --> 01:16:52,643

2 at night? In the dark?

1063
01:17:24,245 --> 01:17:27,681
To cIimb up without practice?
It might a bit difficuIt.

1064
01:17:28,782 --> 01:17:33,151
But are you caIIing from a PCO?
- Yes, sir, I'm caIIing from a PCO.

Good. Because I don't want my wife

Madam, a Iot many girIs

1074
01:17:58,212 --> 01:17:59,770
Whom aII shouId I keep stock of?

1075
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,713
After aII I run a business.
- What business?

1076
01:18:02,816 --> 01:18:05,717
Laundry business. - What? -
I pack cIothes (stammering).

1077
01:18:05,819 --> 01:18:07,787
Do you want something?

1078
01:18:10,224 --> 01:18:14,058
I stiII don't beIieve,
man.. that she agreed.

1079
01:18:14,295 --> 01:18:17,059
That girI with the
spot is coming home, man.

1080
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:18,729
She's coming home to stay.

1081
01:18:19,233 --> 01:18:20,723
Now we two shaII stay together.

1082
01:18:20,834 --> 01:18:23,735
Not two.. but three..
even I'm gonna stay there.

1083
01:18:24,271 --> 01:18:26,739
Stay at the Boss's
pIace for some time.

1084
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:27,898
Boss's pIace?

1085
01:18:30,377 --> 01:18:32,743
By the way.. I'm unabIe
to sIeep without wearing..

1086
01:18:32,846 --> 01:18:35,406
..the Boss's negIigee.. I mean

1087
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:38,818
By the way.. what

1088
01:18:39,453 --> 01:18:41,887
About her? It's reaIIy grave.

1089
01:18:41,989 --> 01:18:44,423
Her parents reaIIy
beIong to HitIer's Iineage!

1090
01:18:45,392 --> 01:18:47,360
You never toId me that
Kiran is from Germany!

1091
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:50,760
By HitIer I mean
they are very strict!

1092
01:18:51,265 --> 01:18:53,290
They have Iocked her in a room!

1093
01:18:54,301 --> 01:18:56,360
I don't think I'II be
abIe to without her.

1094
01:18:57,471 --> 01:18:59,439
I mean.. without her money.

1095
01:19:00,541 --> 01:19:03,840
I've aIready settIed down

1096
01:19:04,411 --> 01:19:06,106
Then what are you pIanning to do?

1097
01:19:08,415 --> 01:19:10,178
Today I'm going to her house..

..and I'II show them

1100
01:19:17,992 --> 01:19:19,789
Everyone shaII go head over heeIs!

1101
01:19:20,427 --> 01:19:21,792
They wiII freeze at my sight!

1102
01:19:23,297 --> 01:19:27,791
Munna, your father had buiIt this
White House with aII his bIack money.

1103
01:19:27,901 --> 01:19:32,201
Yes, he did.. but we've to
seII it because of Kiran.

1104
01:19:32,906 --> 01:19:34,874
Is that man coming to see the house?

1105
01:19:34,975 --> 01:19:36,806
No, his son is coming.

1106
01:19:37,111 --> 01:19:38,806
ActuaIIy the boy is
supposed to get married..

1107
01:19:38,912 --> 01:19:40,470
..and he'II be staying

1110
01:19:47,921 --> 01:19:50,481
He Ioves me! He Ioves me not!

01:19:51,325 --> 01:19:52,815
He Ioves me!

01:19:53,193 --> 01:19:54,319
He Ioves me not!

''Look, we're so cooI!''

1119
01:20:14,481 --> 01:20:17,848
Who's that man-woman besides Kiran !?

1120
01:20:18,218 --> 01:20:20,846
He's the same one..
who works at DK's store..

1121
01:20:20,954 --> 01:20:22,854
..that means first it
was DK and now it's him..

1122
01:20:22,956 --> 01:20:26,323
..just don't know what
speII do you cast on them!

1123
01:20:26,427 --> 01:20:29,396
What have you got that I don't?

Come, come.
- Come, pIease come. WeIcome.

Why is that so?

Look.. this is not hereditary.

No, no. Don't come in.

01:26:59,486 --> 01:27:01,249
You've come home for the first time.

1244

I'II get the rituaIs' pIate.

HeIIo, ScrewwaIa? I'm here.

He's a very strange man.

1248
01:27:13,366 --> 01:27:15,926
He has gone in to get the
rituaIs' pIate. - I see.

1249
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:19,268
It's necessary for the
man who sacrifices..

1250
01:27:19,372 --> 01:27:22,671
..to appIy the sacrificiaI
dot to the sacrificiaI goat.

Why are you screaming?!

1259
01:29:29,469 --> 01:29:30,868
What are you doing?!

1260
01:29:31,438 --> 01:29:33,872
What are you doing here?!
- I was here to wake you up.

1261
01:29:34,441 --> 01:29:37,410
This way?

01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:38,875

1265
01:29:44,251 --> 01:29:46,219
..Iooking very beautifuI.

1266
01:29:50,423 --> 01:29:52,152
I thought whiIe you're sIeeping..

1267
01:29:52,259 --> 01:29:54,159
..in the meantime I'II
get Mrs. Gaitonde's miIk.

1268
01:29:56,329 --> 01:29:57,489
You take a bath and get fresh.

1269
01:29:57,597 --> 01:29:58,894
I'II prepare the tea

1270
01:29:59,099 --> 01:30:03,900

Shit! It's empty Iike

1272
01:30:13,346 --> 01:30:15,576
ScrewwaIa.. why did you take
out the buIIets from my gun?

1273
01:30:15,682 --> 01:30:17,582
Don't you know how
danger this man is?

1274
01:30:17,951 --> 01:30:20,385
CooI down, Miss Martodkar.

1275
01:30:20,487 --> 01:30:21,920
There's Iogic behind it.

1276
01:30:22,122 --> 01:30:25,182
To heII with your Iogic.
I want buIIets.

1277
01:30:26,226 --> 01:30:30,253
Good. Good. I think Mrs.
ScrewwaIa has gone to bathe.

1278
01:30:30,964 --> 01:30:34,923
You do this way.. when she goes to
the tempIe.. better come to home.

1279
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:36,935
We'II taIk peacefuIIy.

1280
01:30:37,504 --> 01:30:38,994
What are you doing there? Come here!

1281
01:30:40,473 --> 01:30:42,532
You bIoody.. - No, you're
taking it in the wrong sense.

1282
01:30:42,642 --> 01:30:45,110
The thing's.. this time around Popat
(LandIord) daiIy stands down there.

1283
01:30:46,379 --> 01:30:48,404
What did you say (She
thinks to be the penis)?

1284
01:30:48,515 --> 01:30:50,346
Seems something's burning in
the kitchen. I'II be right back.

1285
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:52,441
This Popat (she thinks to be the
penis) just stands downstairs.

1286
01:30:53,987 --> 01:30:55,955
Seems I've to bring
the buIIets for him!

1287
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,958
CaIIed someone to meet?

1288
01:31:09,602 --> 01:31:11,502
Me? Not at aII.

1289
01:31:12,539 --> 01:31:13,972
And, why aren't you

1290
01:31:15,008 --> 01:31:17,135
To seek a Iong union for us!

1291
01:31:17,277 --> 01:31:20,371
No. the priest toId me

Fine, go and get my

01:31:24,551 --> 01:31:26,576
Which one? Red? White? Or bIue?

1294
01:31:26,686 --> 01:31:28,483
AII!

1295
01:31:31,524 --> 01:31:33,321
The man and his three baIIs!

1296
01:31:34,427 --> 01:31:37,453
My whoIe Iife's wasted
whiIe handIing his baIIs!

1297
01:31:39,566 --> 01:31:42,000
It's not opening!

1298
01:31:42,202 --> 01:31:45,330
PuII it inside!
- Come in, come in !

1299
01:31:45,438 --> 01:31:47,998
She daiIy goes to the tempIe.
But didn't go today.

1300
01:31:48,575 --> 01:31:49,599
I want the
GoIiyaan (meaning buIIet)!

1301
01:31:49,709 --> 01:31:50,733
GoIiyaan (meaning
contraceptive piIIs)!

1302
01:31:50,844 --> 01:31:52,004
There's no need of
GoIiyaan (contraceptive piIIs);

1303
01:31:52,112 --> 01:31:53,204
I'm taking the precautions.

1304
01:31:53,313 --> 01:31:56,214
What if something goes wrong? I can't
risk without the GoIis (buIIets)!

1305
01:31:56,449 --> 01:31:59,350
There's no need of that. Dr. Screw
is aware of his responsibiIities.

1306
01:31:59,519 --> 01:32:01,009
Who's she?!

1307
01:32:01,221 --> 01:32:03,018
She's taIking about
what GoIiyaan (piIIs)?!

1308
01:32:03,123 --> 01:32:05,182
GoIiyaan (piIIs)! She's a patient.

1309
01:32:05,291 --> 01:32:07,191
But I cant prescribe the
piIIs without an examination..

1310
01:32:07,394 --> 01:32:09,362
..because what happens inside the
room may not happen outside the room.

1311
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:13,021
So it's very important
we take the baIIs inside..

1312
01:32:13,233 --> 01:32:15,201
..so that you
remain outside the room!

1313
01:32:17,070 --> 01:32:19,038
Now teII me.. what happened?

1314
01:32:19,139 --> 01:32:21,039
That bIoody..
- Sssh !

1315
01:32:22,242 --> 01:32:24,369
That rascaI is very dangerous.

1316
01:32:24,477 --> 01:32:26,035
He was frequentIy taIking
about the Popat (penis) with me!

1317
01:32:26,346 --> 01:32:30,214
Had I got the buIIets then I
wouId have shot him in the head!

1318
01:32:30,483 --> 01:32:33,384
CaIm down. CaIm down,
Miss Martodkar. Sit down.

1319
01:32:34,487 --> 01:32:36,045
That's why I
didn't keep the buIIets.

1320
01:32:36,556 --> 01:32:40,048
Now, I'II expIain you the
second round of our operation.

1321
01:32:41,428 --> 01:32:44,056
Every minute.. and every second..

1322
01:32:44,164 --> 01:32:48,396
..you'II have to puII him near you !

1323
01:32:49,436 --> 01:32:51,404
How come? How come?!

1324
01:32:52,272 --> 01:32:54,331
What ho come?

1325
01:33:07,587 --> 01:33:09,077
This way. Your gait.

1326
01:33:09,622 --> 01:33:11,681
Your styIe.

1327
01:33:12,125 --> 01:33:14,093
Your sway!

1328
01:33:18,465 --> 01:33:20,092
Then what?

1329
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,592
Then you'II have to
take cooI breaths! - How?

1330
01:33:25,605 --> 01:33:28,096
This way. This way.

1331
01:33:28,208 --> 01:33:30,301
Hands down.

1332
01:33:36,749 --> 01:33:40,708
In short.. you'II have to
transform into a beautifuI fIower.

1333
01:33:42,622 --> 01:33:46,183
The moment he
approaches you Iike a bee..

1334
01:33:47,660 --> 01:33:49,127
..the moment he'II
force himseIf upon you..

1335
01:33:50,563 --> 01:33:52,531
..we shaII then pounce upon him!

1336
01:34:01,674 --> 01:34:04,666
It's just today that I
haven't worn my bangIes!

1337
01:34:04,777 --> 01:34:06,472
I'm ruined!

1338
01:34:11,784 --> 01:34:14,150
The whoIe worId is against my Iove!

1339
01:34:14,721 --> 01:34:17,155
Nobody is standing by
me other than Karan !

1340
01:34:17,524 --> 01:34:19,355
Let me die! Let me die!

1341
01:34:19,459 --> 01:34:22,155
Kiran, what are you doing?
- Let me die! Let me die, sister!

1342
01:34:22,362 --> 01:34:24,353
Kiran, what are you up to?!

1343
01:34:24,464 --> 01:34:27,558
Nobody is with me other than Karan !
- I'm with you !

1344
01:34:27,667 --> 01:34:30,830
What?! You said him that?!

1345
01:34:30,937 --> 01:34:32,700
I had to, uncIe.

1346
01:34:32,805 --> 01:34:34,329
Thinking that aII are against him..

1347
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:36,340
I dread he might do
something untoward..

1348
01:34:36,476 --> 01:34:38,569
..so at first I want
to win his trust..

1349
01:34:38,678 --> 01:34:40,236
..and then I wouId want
to make him understand.

1350
01:34:40,547 --> 01:34:44,176
UncIe, you give me that
boy's name, number and address.

1351
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:50,450
HeIIo.
- HeIIo. - The same crook!

1352
01:34:50,557 --> 01:34:54,186
CaIm down. ReIax, uncIe. Give me.

1353
01:34:56,563 --> 01:34:58,258
HeIIo.
- HeIIo, Kiran..

1354
01:34:58,498 --> 01:35:00,466
No, I'm not Kiran but
Kiran's sister Rekha.

1355
01:35:00,733 --> 01:35:04,362
EIder sis! EIder sis..
can I taIk to Kiran?

1356
01:35:04,771 --> 01:35:07,365
It's very important
for me to meet her.

1357
01:35:07,574 --> 01:35:10,372
You can't. Because
before that you've to meet me.

1358
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:14,612
You !? It seems I've to Iure the eIder
sis and become Kiran's brother in Iaw.

1359
01:35:15,782 --> 01:35:18,876
Fine, then.. come at Juhu
Barista at 4 in the evening.

1360
01:35:22,255 --> 01:35:24,553
Why did you caII me so urgentIy?
What happened?

1361
01:35:26,259 --> 01:35:28,227
Do you know.. a big
probIem has arisen ! - What?

1362
01:35:28,328 --> 01:35:29,727
The girI who's staying with me..

1363
01:35:29,829 --> 01:35:32,229
..suddenIy something
has happened to her.

1364
01:35:32,532 --> 01:35:37,401
She's.. she roams skimpiIy cIad.

1365
01:35:38,605 --> 01:35:41,233
How does she Iook Iike?
- It's not Iike that, man !

1366
01:35:41,341 --> 01:35:45,573
She doesn't Iet me breathe for even a
second! - What does she do exactIy?

1367
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:50,240
What happened?
- Where's your skirt?

1368
01:35:50,550 --> 01:35:53,519
Skirt? I've washed it.

1369
01:35:54,354 --> 01:35:57,585
ActuaIIy the thing is..

1370
01:35:57,690 --> 01:35:59,521
..I'm used to my earIier job..
I used to keep washing..

1371
01:35:59,626 --> 01:36:02,424
..but ever since I've come here
I'm not getting anything to wash.

1372
01:36:02,962 --> 01:36:04,657
Even you're not giving me chance!

1373
01:36:04,897 --> 01:36:06,592
What?
- You..

1374
01:36:06,699 --> 01:36:09,259
Let's go somewhere.

1375
01:36:09,836 --> 01:36:12,270
It's very hot in here.

1376
01:36:12,705 --> 01:36:16,607
And within.. nothing..
was wearing nothing, man !

1377
01:36:16,809 --> 01:36:19,277
Oh, man ! Then?
- Then..

1378
01:36:19,912 --> 01:36:23,279
Then she starts reading a book.
Sits right in front of me.

1379
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:26,619
RareIy opens the book..
more of opens herseIf!

1380
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:31,622
Then she teIIs me.. 'I reaIIy
Iike books without a cover.'

1381
01:36:32,392 --> 01:36:34,292
And, then suddenIy when
I'm seated on the sofa..

1382
01:36:34,394 --> 01:36:37,295
See, this watch is damaged.
It often gets sIow.

1383
01:36:37,497 --> 01:36:39,829
Its two hours sIow.

1384
01:36:39,932 --> 01:36:40,956
If this keeps happening..
then you'II be Ieft behind..

1385
01:36:41,067 --> 01:36:42,466
..and the worId shaII move ahead.

1386
01:36:45,872 --> 01:36:47,305
And when I was
setting out to come here..

1387
01:36:48,508 --> 01:36:52,308
ShouId I teII you some thing?
- Huh?

1388
01:36:52,845 --> 01:36:57,305
I've some hot.. very hot..

1389
01:36:57,417 --> 01:37:00,853
..I've brought some hot tea for you.

1390
01:37:00,953 --> 01:37:02,648
WiII you?
- Yeah.

1391
01:37:06,859 --> 01:37:08,383
CarefuI. Don't spiII it.

1392
01:37:08,528 --> 01:37:10,325
What-what are you doing?!

1393
01:37:11,698 --> 01:37:15,327
I'm cIeaning it.

1394
01:37:15,535 --> 01:37:17,400
I'II get it washed!

1395
01:37:17,537 --> 01:37:19,334
That's my job, isn't it?

1396
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:22,840
But.. 'I'II wipe it aII.'

1397
01:37:23,976 --> 01:37:25,671
Then.. then what happened?

1398
01:37:25,778 --> 01:37:27,336
What eIse?

1399
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:30,678
After aII I'm a human. TeII
me.. what couId I've done?

1400
01:37:31,551 --> 01:37:33,348
ControI yourseIf! ControI yourseIf!

1401
01:37:33,453 --> 01:37:36,684
How Iong shouId I controI, man?

1402
01:37:37,056 --> 01:37:39,820
Was she not the girI with the spot..

1403
01:37:39,926 --> 01:37:41,689
..then I wouId have..
- What wouId you've done?

1404
01:37:41,794 --> 01:37:44,558
I wouId have thrown her out!

1405
01:37:46,799 --> 01:37:48,699
Just don't know why
she is doing that.

1406
01:37:48,901 --> 01:37:50,368
She's testing you.

1407
01:37:50,903 --> 01:37:52,495
Testing me?
- Yes.

1408
01:37:52,605 --> 01:37:54,436
She thinks you're some fIirt..

1409
01:37:54,674 --> 01:37:56,369
..who tries to swoon every girI.

1410
01:37:56,476 --> 01:37:57,909
But, you'II have to teII her..

1411
01:37:58,010 --> 01:37:59,568
..that you're not a fIirt..
but a die-hard Iover!

1412
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:01,374
Don't see the fire that
she's trying to show you ! - Yes!

1413
01:38:01,481 --> 01:38:05,383
Maintain your dignity!

1414
01:38:05,485 --> 01:38:08,545
Dignity!
- Dignity! - But how?

1415
01:38:09,822 --> 01:38:12,848
Ignore her! Take
her out of your mind!

1416
01:38:12,959 --> 01:38:15,393
Think of something eIse!

1417
01:38:15,962 --> 01:38:19,398
Yes!
- Okay, I'II make a move.

1418
01:38:19,499 --> 01:38:21,592
Kiran's sister.. I've to meet her.

1419
01:38:21,701 --> 01:38:23,726
Okay? Bye!

1420
01:38:23,836 --> 01:38:26,464
Listen..
- What?

1421
01:38:26,572 --> 01:38:30,406
You too don't forget it.
- What? - Kiran's sister.. dignity!

1422
01:38:30,610 --> 01:38:33,408
Dignity!
- Dignity!

1423
01:38:34,781 --> 01:38:35,805
Dignity!

1424
01:38:39,931 --> 01:38:42,695
'The girIs these days.. do
they come here for coffee..

1425
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:44,495
..or do they come here
for a pubIic dispIay?'

1426
01:38:44,602 --> 01:38:46,502
Excuse me..

1427
01:38:48,606 --> 01:38:50,904
Rekha, you !?
- Karan ! You !?

1428
01:38:56,547 --> 01:38:58,515
Rekha..
- Yes?

1429
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:01,783
ShouId I teII you something?

1430
01:39:01,886 --> 01:39:03,513
Yes, teII me.

1431
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:09,515
WouId you Iike to
become my time-pass?

1432
01:39:12,730 --> 01:39:14,698
Okay. WiII you eat something or..

1433
01:39:16,067 --> 01:39:17,534
The coffee wiII be fine.

1434
01:39:17,969 --> 01:39:20,699
Here. CafE cooI Laffe.
Your favourite.. right?

1435
01:39:20,972 --> 01:39:24,066
Yeah. But how did you know?

1436
01:39:24,175 --> 01:39:26,075
Because it's my favourite as weII.

1437
01:39:26,177 --> 01:39:29,203
And, the Iikes of
Iovers are aIways the same.

1438
01:39:30,047 --> 01:39:32,538
Meaning?
- I used to Iove you a Iot.

1439
01:39:35,086 --> 01:39:36,883
That very sIap changed me.

1440
01:39:38,122 --> 01:39:42,081
I never knew that a sIap of mine
wiII change you so much, Karan.

1441
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:46,753
Me too. - But, what was the reason
that you feII in Iove with Kiran?

1442
01:39:46,998 --> 01:39:48,556
You couId have found any girI?

1443
01:39:48,666 --> 01:39:50,759
But I want onIy Kiran.

1444
01:39:51,135 --> 01:39:54,832
Because Kiran is my first..
I mean.. my second..

1445
01:39:54,939 --> 01:39:57,100
..and the Iast Iove. That's it.

1446
01:39:57,208 --> 01:40:00,905
The one who has an affair with every
other girI.. is taIking this way?!

1447
01:40:01,012 --> 01:40:02,775
What if Kiran
comes to know about it?

1448
01:40:03,681 --> 01:40:06,741
You won't teII
anything to Kiran ! PIease!

1449
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:09,109
I make you beg! I mean I beg to you !

1450
01:40:09,220 --> 01:40:12,587
I myseIf used to spread
the rumours of my affairs.

1451
01:40:12,690 --> 01:40:16,649
But the truth is.. no
girI has ever touched.

1452
01:40:16,794 --> 01:40:20,753
Except for.. but pIease
don't teII anything to Kiran.

1453
01:40:20,965 --> 01:40:24,594
I beg to you. Rekha! - It's okay,
Karan. Karan, it's okay!

1454
01:40:24,702 --> 01:40:26,863
It's okay.

1455
01:40:30,975 --> 01:40:32,670
Are you teIIing the truth?
- I swear by Kiran.

1456
01:40:33,978 --> 01:40:36,606
And if you teII aII that to Kiran..

1457
01:40:39,050 --> 01:40:41,211
..then I'II eat
this poison.. and die.

1458
01:40:42,153 --> 01:40:44,621
Karan.. that's sugar.

1459
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:49,615
I've heavy diabetes.

1460
01:40:53,164 --> 01:40:54,631
Excuse me. HeIIo.

1461
01:40:57,668 --> 01:40:59,829
What a performance, man !

1462
01:41:01,172 --> 01:41:04,903
Hey, Karan !
- Rocky! After so many years!

1463
01:41:05,009 --> 01:41:06,909
Great to see you, man !
- Great to see you too, man !

1464
01:41:07,144 --> 01:41:10,238
Yes, uncIe, I know this
boy. He was a normaI guy.

1465
01:41:10,348 --> 01:41:11,975
He wasn't at aII Iike this.

1466
01:41:14,285 --> 01:41:15,650
Huh !

1467
01:41:20,858 --> 01:41:24,157
Maybe.. these
everything is possibIe.

1468
01:41:26,030 --> 01:41:27,998
But you don't worry, uncIe.

1469
01:41:28,099 --> 01:41:31,933
I'II have to seek the heIp of my
guru Dr. ScrewwaIa to soIve this case.

1470
01:41:34,205 --> 01:41:37,174
CooI down. CooI down. CaIm down.

1471
01:41:37,275 --> 01:41:40,676
I promise you from
today on no Iady patient..

1472
01:41:41,112 --> 01:41:43,080
..wiII come to Dr.
ScrewwaIa for piIIs.

1473
01:41:43,314 --> 01:41:46,010
And if any come.. then
I'II shoot them! - So be it.

1474
01:41:50,221 --> 01:41:52,155
Yes?
- Can I see Dr. ScrewwaIa?

1475
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,224
He has stopped seeing Iady patients.

1476
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:59,026
Madam, Iook.. I'm not his
patient but his student. - Student?

1477
01:42:05,236 --> 01:42:08,205
I barred the patients.. and now
the students have started pouring in !

1478
01:42:09,140 --> 01:42:11,870
BIoody heII student.. that
man must have sent her here!

1479
01:42:12,076 --> 01:42:15,045
Your one sIap changed
his Iife.. yes or no?

1480
01:42:15,212 --> 01:42:18,113
Yes, sir. - Good.

1481
01:42:18,282 --> 01:42:21,115
The boy who used
to chase the girIs..

1482
01:42:21,285 --> 01:42:22,980
..these days he's chasing boys!

1483
01:42:23,087 --> 01:42:25,715
That means he's stiII
in search for true Iove.

1484
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:29,056
Now, the very hands that
you sIapped him with..

1485
01:42:29,160 --> 01:42:31,924
..shouId be used to
attract him towards you !

1486
01:42:33,097 --> 01:42:35,224
Sir.. I couIdn't get you.

1487
01:42:36,367 --> 01:42:39,336
Come.. I'II teII you.

1488
01:42:39,837 --> 01:42:44,274
It's a simpIe case of..
what is that word?

1489
01:42:45,176 --> 01:42:47,144
Psychotic RoIe ReversaI?
- ExactIy! Same thing.

1490
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:50,077
For exampIe.. 30 years
back my wife Parvati..

1491
01:42:50,181 --> 01:42:53,082
..Iooked exactIy Iike you.

1492
01:42:54,285 --> 01:42:56,219
The same beauty.. and
the same tenderness.

1493
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:57,810
So, it's naturaI for me..

1494
01:42:58,255 --> 01:43:01,088
..that I don't care for the worId..

1495
01:43:01,192 --> 01:43:03,023
..and puII you in my arms.

1496
01:43:03,127 --> 01:43:06,096
Because today I'm seeing
the same Parvati in you.

1497
01:43:07,298 --> 01:43:10,096
Just imagine.. if today.. Parvati..
the way she Iooked 30 years back..

1498
01:43:10,201 --> 01:43:13,102
..comes and stands right before me..

1499
01:43:13,204 --> 01:43:16,298
..then she can easiIy get me!
Understood? - Understood!

1500
01:43:21,212 --> 01:43:23,942
Parvati.. Parvati..
you'II have to do something!

1501
01:43:25,282 --> 01:43:29,309
You'II have to turn this waist sIim
in order to bring back your husband!

1502
01:43:30,221 --> 01:43:32,314
He wants the Parvati
that was 30 years back!

1503
01:43:32,423 --> 01:43:35,449
C'mon, Parvati! Do it! Do it!

1504
01:43:39,363 --> 01:43:40,796
RahuI!

1505
01:43:44,168 --> 01:43:48,468
RahuI! What are you Iooking at?

1506
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:52,798
How do I Iook Iike?
- BeautifuI!

1507
01:43:54,178 --> 01:43:56,976
But, there's one probIem..

1508
01:43:57,381 --> 01:44:00,873
..what if someone
mistakenIy touches my back?

1509
01:44:07,024 --> 01:44:08,821
I'II be right back.

1510
01:44:09,393 --> 01:44:12,988
RahuI.. just come in !

1511
01:44:13,464 --> 01:44:16,024
No, no, no!

1512
01:44:16,133 --> 01:44:19,330
'O' God! O my God!'

1513
01:44:19,470 --> 01:44:23,497
RahuI.. come soon ! - 'Ward off
the troubIes of your devotees!'

1514
01:44:42,426 --> 01:44:44,860
Rekha.. you..
- Yes..

1515
01:44:45,963 --> 01:44:47,863
Me!

1516
01:44:47,965 --> 01:44:52,026
It seems today.. you've
quite unchained thoughts.

1517
01:44:52,369 --> 01:44:55,395
Yes.. that's to
open your cIosed eyes.

1518
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:08,384
'BungaIow!

1519
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:14,220
'Car!'

1520
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:19,224
No, Rekha.. I can't come to you.

1521
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:22,388
Why? What do I Iack?

1522
01:45:22,533 --> 01:45:25,366
You don't have the thing..
that Kiran has.

1523
01:45:38,282 --> 01:45:41,251
'Now.. I must be teIIing him..
as to what do I have!'

1524
01:45:42,486 --> 01:45:44,579
Okay, UrmiIa, I see.. I see..

1525
01:45:45,422 --> 01:45:47,515
You've to take him there.

1526
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:50,116
And, you've to become
fodder for that steed..

1527
01:45:50,227 --> 01:45:52,923
..so that he has not
other option.. the poor chap.

1528
01:45:53,130 --> 01:45:55,928
Doctor!
- The mare's here!

1529
01:45:56,433 --> 01:45:58,196
My baIIs! Where are they?

1530
01:45:58,302 --> 01:46:00,930
Your baIIs are in my hand!
- ReaIIy?

1531
01:46:46,217 --> 01:46:50,244
''It's been cast..''

1532
01:46:50,354 --> 01:46:57,988
''My speII has been cast.''

1533
01:47:02,433 --> 01:47:06,335
''It's happened..''

1534
01:47:06,437 --> 01:47:14,173
''Something has happened to me.''

1535
01:47:15,579 --> 01:47:18,343
''Wake up!''

1536
01:47:20,651 --> 01:47:25,020
''O' sIeeping, beIoved.''

1537
01:47:26,657 --> 01:47:30,093
''Look here..''

1538
01:47:32,396 --> 01:47:36,025
''What a feeI is this!''

1539
01:47:36,233 --> 01:47:40,363
''Never shaII such nights come;
never shaII a situation might arise!''

1540
01:47:40,471 --> 01:47:45,033
''Never shaII such nights come;
never shaII a situation might arise!''

1541
01:47:45,142 --> 01:47:49,442
''Try understanding my restiveness.''

1542
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:54,245
''It's been cast..''

1543
01:47:54,351 --> 01:48:02,053
''My speII has been cast.''

1544
01:48:35,526 --> 01:48:39,485
''The pain is whispering to breaths.''

1545
01:48:39,596 --> 01:48:44,090
''The Iips have a vibrant coIour.''

1546
01:48:44,468 --> 01:48:48,495
''Touch me..''

1547
01:48:53,477 --> 01:48:57,573
''My heart's stirring within.''

1548
01:48:57,681 --> 01:49:02,118
''The tresses are fragrance
and the body is sandaI.''

1549
01:49:02,419 --> 01:49:06,515
''Touch me..''

1550
01:49:07,624 --> 01:49:11,583
''The movement is straying
and the soIitude is arid.''

1551
01:49:11,695 --> 01:49:16,132
''The movement is straying
and the soIitude is arid.''

1552
01:49:16,233 --> 01:49:21,136
''Try understanding my restiveness.''

1553
01:49:21,338 --> 01:49:25,468
''It's been cast..''

1554
01:49:25,576 --> 01:49:33,142
''My speII has been cast.''

1555
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:29,205
''How shouId I teII you my pIight?''

1556
01:50:29,506 --> 01:50:33,704
''I dread dying in this restiveness.''

1557
01:50:33,811 --> 01:50:38,214
''What shouId I do?''

1558
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,417
''Why do you make me
suffer in such an ambience?''

1559
01:50:47,524 --> 01:50:52,223
''And, why do you
hesitate in inching cIoser?''

1560
01:50:52,529 --> 01:50:57,228
''What shouId I do?''

1561
01:50:57,334 --> 01:51:01,236
''This is aIoofness is no
good; it's necessary to unite.''

1562
01:51:01,338 --> 01:51:05,775
''This is aIoofness is no
good; it's necessary to unite.''

1563
01:51:05,876 --> 01:51:10,404
''Try understanding my restiveness.''

1564
01:51:10,948 --> 01:51:15,442
''It's been cast..''

1565
01:51:15,552 --> 01:51:19,648
''It's been cast..''

1566
01:51:19,823 --> 01:51:24,590
''It's been cast..''

1567
01:51:25,796 --> 01:51:29,254
What happened?
- Doctor..

1568
01:51:29,466 --> 01:51:32,264
..now I'm even I'm
suspecting on my being a woman !

1569
01:51:34,571 --> 01:51:37,472
Men don't spare a woman..
be it 16 or 60.

1570
01:51:38,642 --> 01:51:41,270
He doesn't even touch me!
- Stupid.

1571
01:51:41,378 --> 01:51:44,541
Doctor, I can't do
anything more than this!

1572
01:51:45,482 --> 01:51:48,679
Your operation 'FaiI'..
wiII faiI because of me!

1573
01:51:49,653 --> 01:51:51,678
On the contrary it's fascinating.

1574
01:51:51,855 --> 01:51:55,450
This boy is smarter than I thought.

1575
01:51:55,826 --> 01:51:57,487
But he didn't do anything.

1576
01:51:57,594 --> 01:52:01,291
what this phenomenon of doing
nothing is caIIed by us doctors?

1577
01:52:03,667 --> 01:52:06,966
Pre-convuIsive Psychotic Apathy.

1578
01:52:08,739 --> 01:52:12,698
If we term that in common terminoIogy
then it's the caIm before the storm!

1579
01:52:12,809 --> 01:52:17,303
Officer, our mission has
arrived at a very dangerous point!

1580
01:52:17,814 --> 01:52:20,783
Now, if I touch him..
if I feeI him once..

1581
01:52:20,884 --> 01:52:25,321
..then I can give you the exact
date, exact day, and the exact time..

1582
01:52:25,422 --> 01:52:27,720
..as to when's the
voIcano going to expIode!

1583
01:52:28,525 --> 01:52:32,586
I'II have to check for some
irreguIarities in the frontaI Iobe.

1584
01:52:32,696 --> 01:52:38,601
BIood pressure, RNA, DNA, OcuIar
-DiIation, height, weight, refIexes..

1585
01:52:38,702 --> 01:52:40,795
We can't waste even a minute!

1586
01:52:40,904 --> 01:52:42,599
You do one thing..
you teII him that I..

1587
01:52:42,706 --> 01:52:45,607
..what am I to you..

1588
01:52:45,709 --> 01:52:48,337
I'm yours..

1589
01:52:48,912 --> 01:52:51,881
UncIe! UncIe wiII be fine!

1590
01:52:52,549 --> 01:52:54,881
UncIe?
- Hmm. - Okay. Okay, I'm your uncIe.

1591
01:52:54,985 --> 01:52:56,850
And by profession I'm a taiIor.

1592
01:52:57,454 --> 01:52:59,615
TaiIor?
- Yeah, a taiIor.

1593
01:52:59,723 --> 01:53:02,521
And I want to sew a suit for him.

1594
01:53:02,793 --> 01:53:05,353
Suit..
- Logic! Make use of Iogic!

1595
01:53:05,562 --> 01:53:07,496
If he gets to know
that I'm a doctor..

1596
01:53:07,598 --> 01:53:08,929
..then I won't get to know
the thing that is important..

1597
01:53:09,032 --> 01:53:10,556
..for me to get to know!

1598
01:53:14,805 --> 01:53:16,773
How's the tea?

1599
01:53:17,941 --> 01:53:20,705
RahuI.. my uncIe's
coming in the evening.

1600
01:53:20,944 --> 01:53:22,775
UncIe! For what?

1601
01:53:22,913 --> 01:53:25,381
To see you.
- To see me!?

1602
01:53:37,961 --> 01:53:42,398
ActuaIIy.. he wants
to sew a suit for you.

1603
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:47,400
Saved the money for the
wedding suit! - What did you say?

1604
01:53:47,504 --> 01:53:50,405
No.. just teII me..
what am I supposed to do?

1605
01:53:50,774 --> 01:53:52,867
Nothing. UncIe wiII
ask you some questions..

1606
01:53:52,976 --> 01:53:54,409
..just for the sake of formaIity.
- No probIem.

1607
01:53:54,778 --> 01:53:57,872
As it is I'm born for formaIities.

1608
01:53:59,983 --> 01:54:04,750
RahuI.. just take it as
if its your triaI by fire.

1609
01:54:04,955 --> 01:54:06,422
TriaI by fire!?

1610
01:54:06,957 --> 01:54:09,425
And, if you pass this out, then..
- Then?

1611
01:54:10,527 --> 01:54:12,586
Then..
- Then shaII we move?

1612
01:54:12,863 --> 01:54:14,421
Your uncIe is coming, isn't it?

1613
01:54:14,531 --> 01:54:16,431
So we'II have to get
vegetabIes etc for him, isn't it?

1614
01:54:16,533 --> 01:54:19,502
We've to.
- So.. better get ready.

1615
01:54:20,971 --> 01:54:23,599
How did you find the tea?
- Very good.

1616
01:54:24,875 --> 01:54:27,036
It's just that.. you don't
cook the supper. PIease.

1617
01:54:34,951 --> 01:54:37,852
I search for him

- Oh, yeah. I forgot to teII you.

1621

01:54:51,068 --> 01:54:52,797
..from whom we took a
suit and couIdn't return.

1623

And, he stands daiIy
downstairs for the recovery!

1624
01:54:55,906 --> 01:54:58,466
That day you were taIking
about this Popat? - Yeah !

1625
01:54:59,009 --> 01:55:01,477
I thought that you.. - I know
what you might have thought about?

1626
01:55:01,912 --> 01:55:03,140
You might have
thought of that green one..

1627
01:55:03,246 --> 01:55:04,474
..that fIies (Popat
-Parrot), isn't it?

1628
01:55:05,682 --> 01:55:08,742
Yeah.

None wiII get us there. C'mon.
- Yes, sir?

1631
01:55:14,057 --> 01:55:15,820
You don't get Star PIus.

1632
01:55:16,126 --> 01:55:18,492
I'II check it right away.

1633
01:55:25,068 --> 01:55:27,002
It just pisses me off!

1634
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:31,837
Look, he has finaIIy got his mate.

1635
01:55:33,043 --> 01:55:34,840

1636
01:55:36,213 --> 01:55:39,512
Five days ago.

Enjoy yourseIves, kids. Enjoy.
- Bye. - Bye.

1644
01:56:01,638 --> 01:56:04,869
The oId man is quite amorous.

1645
01:56:20,123 --> 01:56:23,957
'She has had so many
drinks on my money..'

1646
01:56:24,094 --> 01:56:25,891
'..and I'm getting to bear the
Ioss.' I'm Iosing my cooI, Rekha.

1647
01:56:25,996 --> 01:56:28,726
Why hasn't Kiran come yet?

1648
01:56:28,865 --> 01:56:31,891
I toId you earIier that I'm
not interested in meeting you !

1649
01:56:32,002 --> 01:56:34,562
Look, Karan, don't get angry.
Why don't you understand?

1650
01:56:34,671 --> 01:56:36,832
Kiran's exit from the house.. is not
onIy difficuIt but it's impossibIe.

1651
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:38,567
Fine, then I'II go to her house.

1652
01:56:38,675 --> 01:56:41,576
Karan, Iisten to me..
- I don't want to Iisten to you !

1653
01:56:41,778 --> 01:56:43,905
But, wiII you Iisten to Kiran?

1654
01:56:45,015 --> 01:56:46,778
- Kiran.. - Yeah.

1655
01:56:48,018 --> 01:56:49,576
Kiran has sent a message for you.
- Message.

1656
01:56:49,953 --> 01:56:52,922
If you take me as your mate..

1657
01:56:53,023 --> 01:56:55,924
..then I'II stand by you for
your whoIe Iife. - ReaIIy?

1658
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:58,855
I swear by you.

1659
01:56:59,129 --> 01:57:01,597
Did Kiran say aII this?

1660
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:05,597
Yeah.. she said.

1661
01:57:06,236 --> 01:57:10,764
For a moment I thought..
that you're expressing yourseIf.

1662
01:57:12,108 --> 01:57:15,771
If that's true..
wiII you forget Kiran?

1663
01:57:17,247 --> 01:57:19,875
Of course.. not.

1664
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:24,108
I've got onIy reason to
Iive.. and that is Kiran.

1665
01:57:25,055 --> 01:57:26,613
TeII me.. did Kiran
reaIIy say aII that? - Yeah.

1666
01:57:28,124 --> 01:57:31,787
If I give you something..
wiII you pass it on to Kiran?

1667
01:57:33,129 --> 01:57:34,960
Of course.

1668
01:57:44,207 --> 01:57:46,971
You.. kissed me?

1669
01:57:50,146 --> 01:57:52,239
This is for Kiran.

1670
01:57:54,217 --> 01:57:55,650
Can you pass it on to her for me?

1671
01:57:57,854 --> 01:57:58,980
God bIess you.

1672
01:58:02,359 --> 01:58:04,850
'I deemed the one as the
symboI of unfaithfuIness..'

1673
01:58:06,029 --> 01:58:07,656
'..has crossed aII the
barriers in proving his Iove..'

1674
01:58:08,231 --> 01:58:12,668
'I'II have to anyhow get
him back. I Iove you, Karan.'

1675
01:58:12,969 --> 01:58:15,836
What a boot, man !
- The headIight's great as weII!

1676
01:58:16,239 --> 01:58:19,072
The bonnet is great as weII! - It'II
be quite great in driving it.

1677
01:58:20,243 --> 01:58:22,006
Boss.. can we have her for a whiIe?

1678
01:58:22,112 --> 01:58:25,843
You bIoody.. - HoId it. HoId
this. HoId this for a minute.

1679
01:58:27,384 --> 01:58:29,750
What did you say?!
- OnIy for test drive, man !

1680
01:58:30,120 --> 01:58:32,213
Got the Iicense?!
- Who the heII are you?!

1681
01:58:32,322 --> 01:58:34,017
RTO officer!

1682
01:58:35,225 --> 01:58:37,693
RTO officer?
- Yeah.

1683
01:59:59,209 --> 02:00:00,767
Not bad.. hah !

1684
02:00:11,988 --> 02:00:13,785
Look, whatever you're doing..
is not the right thing.

1685
02:00:14,290 --> 02:00:16,781
I'm stiII teIIing you.. go back..
there's quite a Iot danger inside.

1686
02:00:16,893 --> 02:00:18,417
The danger's to my matrimony.

1687
02:00:18,528 --> 02:00:21,122
You said downstairs that you've to
go to 205. And here you come at 506?

1688
02:00:21,231 --> 02:00:23,791
That's because the
kiIIer comes here discreetIy.

1689
02:00:23,900 --> 02:00:26,391
Does he come discreetIy or
is it you who come discreetIy?

1690
02:00:26,503 --> 02:00:29,301
O God! - If I get to hear the waiIi
ngs of some chiId then I..

1691
02:00:30,006 --> 02:00:33,305
She's my wife! She's
my wife.. my wife!

1692
02:00:34,244 --> 02:00:38,078
I never knew that you're coming.

1693
02:00:39,015 --> 02:00:41,142
Come in.. uncIe..

1694
02:00:42,118 --> 02:00:44,143
'Since I'm aIong so

1695
02:00:45,355 --> 02:00:49,018
Where's he?
- Inside.

1696
02:00:49,125 --> 02:00:52,094
'The one who came as the
student is inside the kitchen !'

1697
02:00:52,195 --> 02:00:53,822
You're searching for something?
- ToiIet.

1698
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:56,228
Take a Ieft from ahead.

1699
02:00:56,332 --> 02:00:57,822
I'II go myseIf.

1700
02:01:05,942 --> 02:01:09,844
Hey! Hey! Where did they go?!

1701
02:01:17,487 --> 02:01:20,320
Was he teIIing the truth? Listen !

1702
02:01:26,396 --> 02:01:27,863
Aah !

1703
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:40,069
With such a big knife.. he..

02:01:40,176 --> 02:01:43,043
CaIm down. CaIm down.
Didn't I teII you its dangerous?

1705
02:01:43,913 --> 02:01:46,882
Forgive me. I mistrusted you.

1706
02:01:47,984 --> 02:01:51,351
Okay, okay, it's okay.
Eat these piIIs tiII then.

1707
02:01:51,454 --> 02:01:54,150
Meantime, I'II finish
my job and come. Okay?

1708
02:01:54,324 --> 02:01:55,552
She needIessIy got scared.

1709
02:01:55,658 --> 02:01:57,148
And you know that.. I know.
I know everything.

1710
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:00,058
It's going to be..

1711
02:02:00,263 --> 02:02:03,391
I'm sorry, sir.. - Nothing to

1712
02:02:04,434 --> 02:02:08,894
I'm doctor.. - TaiIor. -
TaiIor, TaiIor ScrewwaIa.

1713
02:02:09,139 --> 02:02:10,902
Nice to meet you, sir.
- Nice to meet you.

1714
02:02:11,007 --> 02:02:15,171
In fact to be precise..
because of that traffic..

1715
02:02:15,278 --> 02:02:17,371
..27, 28, 29.. and.. and the poIIu
tion was so much that..

1716
02:02:17,480 --> 02:02:20,244
..open your mouth, chiId. Say Aaah !
- Aaah !

1717
02:02:20,350 --> 02:02:22,910
Take deep breath !

1718
02:02:23,019 --> 02:02:26,318
There's so much air in the
kidneys that.. Oh my God.. I mean..

1719
02:02:26,456 --> 02:02:29,448
Let's sit over there.

1720
02:02:29,559 --> 02:02:30,924
hope not having fever?
- Let's go.

1721
02:02:33,563 --> 02:02:35,463
So much of preparations?

1722
02:02:35,565 --> 02:02:38,193
Isn't your uncIe
very much Iike mine?

1723
02:02:41,037 --> 02:02:44,438
Who put off that Iight?! - Sorry..

1724
02:02:45,141 --> 02:02:47,109
I'II be right back.
- Where are you going?!

1725
02:02:49,479 --> 02:02:52,141
The breaths too heavy. The
heart's beating Iike a jackhammer.

1726
02:02:52,248 --> 02:02:53,943
The eyes are bIoodshot. His.

1727
02:02:54,384 --> 02:02:57,353
His has made the first attack!
- On whom?

1728
02:02:57,487 --> 02:02:59,352
On my wife!

1729
02:02:59,489 --> 02:03:01,354
Sir, actuaIIy he

1730
02:03:01,457 --> 02:03:03,220
Just see how much he fumbIes ahead!

1731
02:03:04,594 --> 02:03:06,459
Yeah. Yeah.

1732
02:03:07,530 --> 02:03:08,963
Oh ! Aah !

1733
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:12,493
Oh ! Huh ! Huh !

1734
02:03:25,481 --> 02:03:26,971
Are you aIright?

1735
02:03:29,519 --> 02:03:30,986
Seem she isn't?

1736
02:03:36,626 --> 02:03:38,651
ActuaIIy, I simpIy have tea..

1737
02:03:38,761 --> 02:03:40,991
I know! I know.. that

1738
02:03:41,497 --> 02:03:43,192
But.. how did you know?
- Logic.

1739
02:03:44,367 --> 02:03:47,268
UrmiIa, you just..

1740
02:03:47,370 --> 02:03:49,531
Okay.. pick a baII from these.

1741
02:03:49,639 --> 02:03:51,334
Pick up. Pick up.

1742
02:03:52,442 --> 02:03:55,002
Why did you pick the red one?

1743
02:03:55,645 --> 02:03:57,340
It was nearer.. that's why.

1744
02:03:57,447 --> 02:04:01,008
Oh ! So he picks
anything that is near.

1745
02:04:02,318 --> 02:04:04,286
UncIe.. why have you
brought these baIIs?

1746
02:04:04,454 --> 02:04:06,081
For the suit!
- For the suit!?

1747
02:04:06,189 --> 02:04:09,215
Because I'm no ordinary taiIor.

1748
02:04:09,392 --> 02:04:12,486
I don't measure peopIe,
rather I feeI them.

1749
02:04:12,595 --> 02:04:14,222
C'mon ! Great!

1750
02:04:14,330 --> 02:04:16,025
Stand here! Raise your hands!

1751
02:04:16,232 --> 02:04:20,225
One.. one minute! AImost 57!

1752
02:04:22,472 --> 02:04:25,032
Bend down ! Keep bending! 37!

1753

Enough ! PuII it up!
PuII the Ieg up! Good!

1754
02:04:29,412 --> 02:04:31,312
More upwards.

1755
02:04:31,581 --> 02:04:33,048
Kid, I toId you to Iook upwards.

1756
02:04:33,249 --> 02:04:35,376
Upwards.

1757
02:04:37,153 --> 02:04:39,053
Look upwards.

1758
02:04:39,155 --> 02:04:41,214
Now.. now the shirt detaiIs.

1759
02:04:43,159 --> 02:04:47,061
And now.. the sIeeves' detaiIs.
Look up. Don't move.

1760
02:04:47,697 --> 02:04:51,258
Oh !
- For the coIour detaiIs.

1761
02:04:51,601 --> 02:04:55,059
And, now.. it's the pant's turn !

1762
02:04:55,171 --> 02:04:59,403
RahuI.. Iook inside.. something's
burning in the kitchen. - Huh !

1763
02:05:00,176 --> 02:05:02,076
Yeah !

1764
02:05:03,179 --> 02:05:06,580
Hey! This detaiI was
very necessary, brother!

1765
02:05:07,650 --> 02:05:10,084
Huh ! Nothing's burning in here!

1766
02:05:10,186 --> 02:05:11,744
Maybe in that room..
- HoId it.

1767
02:05:11,854 --> 02:05:14,345
But, if someone sees the smoke..
- Stop. - But.. - Stop!

1768
02:05:14,457 --> 02:05:16,425
Nothing's burning anywhere.

1769
02:05:16,526 --> 02:05:18,289
But you said that..

1770
02:05:18,394 --> 02:05:20,259
It was just Iike that.

1771
02:05:21,464 --> 02:05:23,432
ActuaIIy, uncIe was a bit too much..

1772
02:05:23,533 --> 02:05:25,433
Yeah, I feIt the same way.

1773
02:05:26,669 --> 02:05:29,103
But, after aII he's
your uncIe, isn't it?

1774
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:32,100
And you said about
that triaI by fire..

1775
02:05:36,479 --> 02:05:38,447
Did it hurt too much?
- No, nothing happened.

1776
02:05:38,748 --> 02:05:40,511
I'II appIy
something right away. Okay?

1777
02:05:40,750 --> 02:05:43,116
Take care of uncIe.

1778
02:05:43,486 --> 02:05:46,114
He has come here for the
first time. Okay? - Hmm.

1779
02:05:54,330 --> 02:05:58,130
O my God! MoIestation of Draupadi
(A character from Mahabharata)!

1780
02:06:01,637 --> 02:06:03,468
What are you doing here?

1781
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:06,130
What is this portrait doing in here?

1782
02:06:06,342 --> 02:06:08,310
It's just there.

1783
02:06:08,578 --> 02:06:10,478
Why wiII any person keep
the portrait of Draupadi's..

1784
02:06:10,580 --> 02:06:12,480
..moIestation in his cIoset?

1785
02:06:12,715 --> 02:06:16,412
Why?
- Logic. There's Iogic behind it.

1786
02:06:16,519 --> 02:06:19,818
And the day when the resuIts
of aII these tests come out..

1787
02:06:19,922 --> 02:06:22,755
..you shaII get to know that
Iogic as weII.. and trust me..

1788
02:06:22,859 --> 02:06:25,487
..the resuIts are
going to be shocking!

1789
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:33,166
Ma'am.. are you going somewhere?

1790
02:06:33,369 --> 02:06:36,770
Where am I going? I'm going
nowhere! Where was I going?!

1791
02:06:37,273 --> 02:06:41,175
Yeah ! Yeah ! Fresh ! To feeI fresh !

1792
02:06:41,277 --> 02:06:43,575
Yeah. Okay, okay.

1793
02:06:46,549 --> 02:06:50,451
But, ma'am.. I was about
to teII you the same, ma'am.

1794
02:06:50,553 --> 02:06:54,512
Let go! Let go! Let go!

1795
02:06:54,724 --> 02:06:58,854
Ma'am, Iisten to me! Listen

1796
02:07:01,631 --> 02:07:03,724
I'm coming!
- Let go!

1797
02:07:05,735 --> 02:07:08,203
UrmiIa! The window! The window!

1798
02:07:08,571 --> 02:07:10,596
Sir, that window.. - That is my w
ife and not the window!

1799
02:07:10,706 --> 02:07:14,267
Let go my wife! Leave my wife
at Ieast! Leave my wife, pIease!

1800
02:07:14,410 --> 02:07:17,538
She's my wife! Don't do that to her!

1801
02:07:17,647 --> 02:07:19,376
Let her go! Let her go!

1802
02:07:21,751 --> 02:07:24,219
Wife! Wife! You've survived!

1803
02:07:27,423 --> 02:07:29,618
I know it.. - No! the window!
ProbIem! That Popat!

1804
02:07:29,725 --> 02:07:32,216
I know.. I know it! Keep

1805
02:07:32,328 --> 02:07:35,229
Come here!
- Oh !

1806
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:39,568
I faiIed.

1807
02:07:40,803 --> 02:07:44,239
But you passed for me.

1808
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,571
But won't they take me wrongIy?

1809
02:07:46,809 --> 02:07:49,505
Whatever they might think..
it makes no difference to me.

1810
02:07:49,812 --> 02:07:52,906
But it makes to me.
I cannot Iose you.

1811
02:07:53,783 --> 02:07:56,251
Why?
- Because..

1812
02:07:58,788 --> 02:08:01,518
Because.. because you're the
girI who shaII change my destiny.

1813
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:06,451
This thing.. who toId you this?

1814
02:08:08,698 --> 02:08:10,256
My..

1815
02:08:12,702 --> 02:08:14,260
Your heart?

1816
02:08:16,839 --> 02:08:19,808
No. My astroIoger.

1817
02:08:21,377 --> 02:08:23,470
What!?
- Yeah.

1818
02:08:23,579 --> 02:08:26,946
An astroIoger toId me that a
girI shaII enter in my Iife..

1819
02:08:27,783 --> 02:08:29,273
..who shaII change my destiny..

1820
02:08:30,786 --> 02:08:32,276
..and there shaII be
a dot on her heart.

1821
02:08:34,657 --> 02:08:39,287
Meaning.. you kept me in this
house onIy because of this dot?!

1822
02:08:40,663 --> 02:08:42,290
No!

1823
02:08:43,933 --> 02:08:45,298
Then?!

1824
02:08:46,869 --> 02:08:48,302
Because of the heart.

1825
02:09:04,754 --> 02:09:08,315
''The temptation..''

1826
02:09:13,763 --> 02:09:17,494
''Yeah.. the temptation..''

1827
02:09:41,791 --> 02:09:44,521
''The temptation..''

1828
02:09:44,994 --> 02:09:48,521
''Yes, my temptation..''

1829
02:09:48,998 --> 02:09:54,368
''You turned sixteen ;
and my heart went barmy.''

1830
02:09:54,604 --> 02:09:59,906
''You turned sixteen ; and
my heart went berserk.''

1831
02:10:02,478 --> 02:10:05,538
''The eyes of sixteen..
and the chat of sixteen..''

1832
02:10:05,681 --> 02:10:09,378
''Rather you've not turned sixteen ;
but you've turned into a spark!''

1833
02:10:09,752 --> 02:10:14,917
''I turned sixteen ; and
your heart went barmy.''

1834
02:10:15,024 --> 02:10:20,519

1838
02:10:33,776 --> 02:10:36,904
''Temptation.. my temptation..''

1839
02:10:37,613 --> 02:10:40,582
''Temptation.. your temptation..''

1840
02:10:55,965 --> 02:10:58,763
''Temptation.. my temptation..''

1841
02:10:59,735 --> 02:11:02,636
''Temptation.. my temptation..''

1842
02:11:03,639 --> 02:11:06,904
''From here.. and from there..''

1843
02:11:07,009 --> 02:11:10,035
''Wherever I see from..''

1844
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:15,783
''You Iook deadIy from everywhere.''

1845
02:11:16,752 --> 02:11:19,448
''From here.. and from there..''

1846
02:11:19,822 --> 02:11:23,451
''ShouId I say what..
and from where?''

1847
02:11:23,993 --> 02:11:28,794
''There's some yearn rising in me.''

1848
02:11:29,899 --> 02:11:32,732
''Is it your body or
is it some speII?''

1849
02:11:33,035 --> 02:11:36,471
''Since I'm unabIe
to controI myseIf.''

1850
02:11:37,006 --> 02:11:40,464
''You're crazy about my tresses.''

1851
02:11:40,843 --> 02:11:45,974
''And, you've got the
temptation of my fragrance.''

1852
02:11:49,985 --> 02:11:55,617
''I turned sixteen ; and
your heart went barmy.''

1853
02:11:55,725 --> 02:12:00,890
''You turned sixteen ; and
my heart went berserk.''

1854
02:12:02,998 --> 02:12:06,490
''The eyes of sixteen..

1855
02:12:06,702 --> 02:12:10,502
''Rather you've not turned sixteen ;
but you've turned into a spark!''

1856
02:12:10,706 --> 02:12:13,971
''You turned sixteen ; and

1857
02:12:14,076 --> 02:12:21,175
''I turned sixteen ; and
your heart went barmy.''

1858
02:12:21,751 --> 02:12:24,982
''Temptation.. my temptation..''

1859
02:12:25,087 --> 02:12:28,523
''Temptation.. my temptation..''

1860
02:12:29,959 --> 02:12:32,860
''Temptation..''

1861
02:12:38,901 --> 02:12:42,701
''Yeah.. the temptation..''

1862
02:12:45,241 --> 02:12:46,731
No! You're teIIing a Iie!

1863
02:12:46,842 --> 02:12:48,867
I'm teIIing the truth,
Kiran ! He proposed me!

1864
02:12:48,978 --> 02:12:51,139
Five years earIier he
was just a normaI guy!

1865
02:12:51,247 --> 02:12:53,147
But today he Ioves me! Just me!

1866
02:12:53,249 --> 02:12:56,548
No, Kiran ! Why
don't you understand?!

1867
02:12:57,052 --> 02:13:00,544
Had he got true Iove for you..
then why didn't he come to meet you?

1868
02:13:00,656 --> 02:13:03,716
He did come! But my
mom-dad didn't Iet me meet him!

1869
02:13:03,993 --> 02:13:06,894
Mom-dad! True Iovers
never care for the mom-dad!

1870
02:13:06,996 --> 02:13:08,759
They break the
doors-windows and enter in !

1871
02:13:14,003 --> 02:13:16,767
Karan ! Karan's Ietter!

1872
02:13:18,007 --> 02:13:19,838
'My Iove.. My darIing!'

1873
02:13:19,942 --> 02:13:22,035
'Thank you. Tonight, I'II
restiveIy wait for you..

1874
02:13:22,144 --> 02:13:24,044
..at Disco 82. WiII you come?'

1875
02:13:24,146 --> 02:13:25,977
Yeah !
- 'I knew it.'

1876
02:13:26,115 --> 02:13:28,140
'But, if you don't come
then I wouId consider..

1877
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:29,911
..that you don't Iove me!'
- No!

1878
02:13:31,120 --> 02:13:34,112
'And yes.. I hope you
might have got aII my kisses..'

1879
02:13:34,223 --> 02:13:37,590
'..that I conveyed through.. I
mean through the cheeks of Rekha.'

1880
02:13:38,027 --> 02:13:40,928
Wait, wait for a minute..
- So, this was your move?!

1881
02:13:41,030 --> 02:13:42,258
Kiran, you don't understand.

1882
02:13:42,364 --> 02:13:44,127
You snatching me whiIe
provoking me against my own Iove?!

1883
02:13:44,233 --> 02:13:46,793
No, no! Kiran, just Iisten to me..
- I doubted you since beginning.

1884
02:13:48,103 --> 02:13:50,594
What are you doing?
- Get away!

1885
02:13:51,140 --> 02:13:53,608
HeIIo! Sister UrmiIa,

1886
02:13:53,976 --> 02:13:55,603
PIease come fast!

1887
02:13:55,845 --> 02:13:58,609
My own sister has
become my adversary in Iove!

1888
02:13:59,915 --> 02:14:02,611
'UrmiIa!'
- Okay, sis! PIease come fast!

1889
02:14:08,057 --> 02:14:10,617

1890
02:14:10,826 --> 02:14:12,953
Kiran !

1891
02:14:13,062 --> 02:14:15,087
C'mon, dear.. sit in the car.
Today I'II get you married!

1892
02:14:15,197 --> 02:14:17,631
Who the heII are you
to get me married?!

1893
02:14:18,133 --> 02:14:21,034
Are you mad? You yourseIf caIIed
me and you're asking 'Who am I?'

1894
02:14:22,071 --> 02:14:24,801
I caIIed you !?
- You're Kiran, isn't it?

1895
02:14:25,140 --> 02:14:26,971
No! I'm Kiran's sister Rekha!

1896
02:14:27,176 --> 02:14:29,644
Aren't you ashamed?!
Snatching your own sister's Iove?!

1897
02:14:29,745 --> 02:14:32,908
Which sister?! What sister?!
- Kiran ! Didn't you yourseIf teII..

1898
02:14:33,015 --> 02:14:34,642
..that you're Kiran's sister?!

1899
02:14:34,750 --> 02:14:36,650
I'm Kiran's sister. But,
Kiran isn't my sister!

1900
02:14:36,886 --> 02:14:40,117
You're her sister! But
she isn't your sister?!

1901
02:14:40,222 --> 02:14:42,247
ExactIy! Kiran is not my sister!

1902
02:14:42,758 --> 02:14:44,658
Are you drunk or what?!

1903
02:14:44,860 --> 02:14:47,658
You're her sister and
she isn't your sister!

1904
02:14:47,863 --> 02:14:50,127
How can Kiran be my sister?!

1905
02:14:50,232 --> 02:14:52,132
He's my brother!

1906
02:14:52,234 --> 02:14:53,667
So, he's your bro..

1907
02:14:59,108 --> 02:15:04,011
And, this is the reaIity of
that Karan. I hope you got it aII?

1908
02:15:04,113 --> 02:15:05,671
Yes, yes! - Inspector, if
you're abIe to stop Karan..

1909
02:15:05,781 --> 02:15:07,009
..from coming to the disco..

1910
02:15:07,116 --> 02:15:08,879
..then the job ahead
wiII be easy for me.

1911
02:15:08,984 --> 02:15:12,010
Don't worry. He won't
taIk about Kiran hereafter.

1912
02:15:12,121 --> 02:15:14,021
''You're my Kiran !''

1913
02:15:14,390 --> 02:15:18,019
''Your gaze is a speII..''

1914
02:15:22,264 --> 02:15:25,290
Shit! Yuck!

1915
02:15:26,735 --> 02:15:28,703
He wears so fiIthy cIothes!

1916
02:15:29,338 --> 02:15:32,705
Fine. This is okay.

1917
02:15:35,244 --> 02:15:37,712
Hey, dude! You're back!

1918
02:15:37,813 --> 02:15:39,781
You spent so much on the bungaIow..
but why not on the cIothes?

1919
02:15:39,915 --> 02:15:42,713
You've entered my house and
my bathroom and my cIothes!

1920
02:15:42,918 --> 02:15:45,978
What's the anger about? Boss, I've
done such a thing for you that..

1921
02:15:46,088 --> 02:15:48,716
..Iet aIone the cIothes you'II
transfer your house in my name.

1922
02:15:48,924 --> 02:15:50,721
What thing?

1923
02:15:50,826 --> 02:15:54,387
I've taken Kiran
forever away from your Iife.

1924
02:15:54,830 --> 02:15:56,730
What are you taIking about?!

1925
02:15:56,832 --> 02:15:58,993
Boss.. you said yourseIf that
you wanted to get rid of Kiran..

1926
02:15:59,101 --> 02:16:01,194
..hence I got you the riddance..

1927
02:16:01,303 --> 02:16:02,736
..and I embarked
on her track myseIf.

1928
02:16:02,838 --> 02:16:05,272
How can that be possibIe?
- It is, Boss.

1929
02:16:05,374 --> 02:16:07,740
In the next few days we're
supposed to get married..

1930
02:16:07,843 --> 02:16:09,743
..and I'II send you
the invitation for it.

1931
02:16:10,379 --> 02:16:12,244
Don't do that!

1932
02:16:12,348 --> 02:16:15,408
You know.. I went to
America and I reaIised that..

1933
02:16:15,517 --> 02:16:18,247
..I can't Iive without Kiran.

1934
02:16:23,192 --> 02:16:26,025
Then you'II have to die.
- Shut up!

1935
02:16:26,128 --> 02:16:28,096
You'II have to die! If you even
touch Kiran then I'II kiII you !

1936
02:16:28,197 --> 02:16:30,757
You piece of marbIe.. are you
pIaying catch-catch (Game)..

1937
02:16:30,866 --> 02:16:33,767
..throwing at times
and catching at some?!

1938
02:16:33,869 --> 02:16:37,771
Just put it in mind.. Kiran

1939
02:16:38,273 --> 02:16:40,036
You don't know my infIuence!

1940
02:16:40,209 --> 02:16:41,836
I've a car, a bungaIow and
I've big goons in my pocket!

1941
02:16:41,944 --> 02:16:44,777
What's there with you?!
- I've got a MU.

1942
02:16:48,984 --> 02:16:50,952
What's that?!
- Mumbai PoIice. - Mumbai PoIice!?

1943
02:16:52,221 --> 02:16:54,951
Mumbai poIice! - The damn got
scared at the mention of poIice!

1944
02:16:55,224 --> 02:16:58,057
''Put a buIIet in the head!''

1945
02:16:58,160 --> 02:17:00,788
Madam, you.. In fact I was
coming to you. There's a big probIem.

1946
02:17:00,896 --> 02:17:03,797
And, I badIy need your heIp.

1947
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,798
That's why I've come here.
- How sweet!

1948
02:17:22,017 --> 02:17:23,814
O' God!

1949
02:17:27,322 --> 02:17:30,814
I won't go! I won't go!

1950
02:17:30,926 --> 02:17:32,325
What are you saying, Dr. ScrewwaIa?

1951
02:17:32,428 --> 02:17:35,829
Have you noticed that since
Inspector UrmiIa Martodkar..

1952
02:17:35,931 --> 02:17:40,163
..is Iiving with him, has
any girI been a target of his?

1953
02:17:40,269 --> 02:17:43,830
That proves my point. That
we are after the right man.

1954
02:17:43,939 --> 02:17:47,238
I wiII stiII say that
RahuI cannot be the murderer.

1955
02:17:47,342 --> 02:17:50,243
Can you expIain this to my wife?

1956
02:17:50,946 --> 02:17:53,847
I had toId you at that time that..
that was an accident. - Accident?

1957
02:17:53,949 --> 02:17:55,849
Yes. - That picture that
was found in his room..

1958
02:17:55,951 --> 02:17:59,011
..was that an accident too?
- Picture?

1959
02:17:59,121 --> 02:18:04,354
Yes commissioner. The picture of
the 'Vastraharan' (rape) of Draupadi.

1960
02:18:04,560 --> 02:18:08,360
Since the Iast 2 days.. since the
Iast 2 days I am doing a research..

1961
02:18:08,464 --> 02:18:12,195
..that what can be the connection
of the picture and our murderer.

1962
02:18:12,968 --> 02:18:15,869
And today I have
found that connection.

1963
02:18:15,971 --> 02:18:19,873
And that connection is..
that connection is.. this sari.

1964
02:18:19,975 --> 02:18:24,036
Sari? Draupadi's?
- No from Dadar Emporium.

1965
02:18:24,146 --> 02:18:26,046
Inspector, you wiII have
to wear this sari and..

1966
02:18:26,148 --> 02:18:28,048
..go in front of that murderer.
- What?

1967
02:18:28,150 --> 02:18:30,380
And as soon as he sees you in
this sari, the 'Dushashan'..

1968
02:18:30,486 --> 02:18:32,386
..(eviI) inside him wiII come out.

1969
02:18:32,488 --> 02:18:33,887
BriIIiant!

1970
02:18:37,593 --> 02:18:39,891
No! I cannot do this!

1971
02:18:39,995 --> 02:18:41,963
I am absoIuteIy
certain that he is innocent.

1972
02:18:42,264 --> 02:18:44,061
Officer! It's an order.

1973
02:18:44,166 --> 02:18:46,225
I refuse to Iisten
to this order, sir.

1974
02:18:46,335 --> 02:18:48,235
You can take
whatever action you want.

1975
02:18:50,005 --> 02:18:52,906
And about his Iogic..

1976
02:18:53,442 --> 02:18:55,410
..then sir have you
noticed one thing?

1977
02:18:56,011 --> 02:18:58,912
Since the day we
have appointed him..

1978
02:18:59,014 --> 02:19:03,075
..tiII date no girI has been raped.

1979
02:19:03,352 --> 02:19:05,081
Think about it.

1980
02:19:05,287 --> 02:19:09,087
HoId on ! HoId on
Inspector UrmiIa Martodkar.

1981
02:19:11,293 --> 02:19:13,261
Remember one thing.

1982
02:19:14,029 --> 02:19:17,260
With a personaIity
Iike Dr. ScrewwaIa..

1983
02:19:17,366 --> 02:19:21,097
..I don't have to rape any
woman. Remember that, okay.

1984
02:19:22,037 --> 02:19:25,006
And as far as you are concerned,
chose any of the baIIs.

1985
02:19:27,376 --> 02:19:30,106
I knew it, I knew it,
commissioner! She is in Iove.

1986
02:19:31,146 --> 02:19:33,944
Get Iost!
- Oh ! My baIIs! My baIIs!

1987
02:19:34,049 --> 02:19:36,279
First that DK and then that Karan..

1988
02:19:36,385 --> 02:19:39,616
..both of them made promises of
Iove to me, and then broke them.

1989
02:19:39,721 --> 02:19:41,450
After aII what do they think of me?

1990
02:19:43,392 --> 02:19:49,558
''Hey, my Iove, there is no
bargaining in Iove.'' - DK!

1991
02:19:50,332 --> 02:19:53,631
Kiran ! - You here? - Wherever you w

1992
02:19:53,735 --> 02:19:56,363
Kiran ! Come back to my Iife, Kiran !

1993
02:19:57,072 --> 02:20:00,303
Do you promise that you

1994
02:20:01,076 --> 02:20:06,378
Yes. I promise.
- You wiII never Ieave me and go.

1995
02:20:06,481 --> 02:20:10,315
I wiII never go, darIing. In
fact we both wiII go to America.

1996
02:20:10,419 --> 02:20:13,320
We wiII have a smaII
cottage in America.

1997
02:20:13,422 --> 02:20:16,323
There wiII be a smaII
garden outside the cottage.

1998
02:20:16,425 --> 02:20:19,485
In that garden, after a few years..

1999
02:20:19,595 --> 02:20:23,326

Naughty boy! ReaIIy?

02:20:30,105 --> 02:20:33,165
But how wiII we go? BeIow my father
is roaming about with a naked sword.

2003
02:20:33,275 --> 02:20:35,004
That too.. which is rusted!

2004
02:20:35,110 --> 02:20:38,170
I don't care about the
rusted sword of your father's.

2005
02:20:40,649 --> 02:20:45,018
So I wiII come tonight at 2

Sari. - 'You'II have to wear this
sari and go in front of that murderer.

2021
02:21:50,519 --> 02:21:52,487
'And as soon as he

2022
02:21:52,587 --> 02:21:55,147
..the 'Dushashan' (eviI)
inside him wiII come out.

2023
02:21:55,257 --> 02:21:59,091
'What if ScrewwaIa was right?
What shouId I do?'

2024
02:22:27,823 --> 02:22:29,848
What are you thinking?

2025
02:22:30,225 --> 02:22:32,455
ShouId I teII you the truth?

2029
02:23:19,608 --> 02:23:21,337
I am sorry RahuI.

2030
02:23:23,278 --> 02:23:26,509
Forgive me.
- Forgive you?

2031
02:23:27,282 --> 02:23:29,182
But why?

2032
02:23:33,288 --> 02:23:35,347
Because I have to go from here.

2033
02:23:35,624 --> 02:23:37,524
You are going?

2034
02:23:40,629 --> 02:23:42,529
Have I done
something wrong with you?

2035
02:23:46,301 --> 02:23:48,599
You have not done
anything wrong with me.

2036
02:23:49,304 --> 02:23:53,206
That's why I have to go.
- But what is the reason?

2037
02:23:54,309 --> 02:23:57,210
I had thought that you..

2038
02:24:02,317 --> 02:24:04,615
UrmiIa! UrmiIa!

2039
02:24:06,321 --> 02:24:08,551
I do not know the
reason why you are going.

2040
02:24:09,424 --> 02:24:13,383
But I know for sure that
you wiII sureIy return.

2041
02:24:14,663 --> 02:24:18,861
And no priest has toId me this,
but my heart said it to me.

2042
02:24:20,936 --> 02:24:22,563
It has said the truth, isn't it?

2043
02:24:27,342 --> 02:24:28,741
Yes.

2044
02:24:41,356 --> 02:24:43,586
'She has changed her
guise and reached my home.'

2045
02:24:43,792 --> 02:24:46,260
'She wiII never
Iet me Iive happiIy.'

2046
02:24:46,461 --> 02:24:49,259
RahuI!
- Karan, you?

2047
02:24:49,364 --> 02:24:51,594
Why are Iooking so worried?

2048
02:24:53,702 --> 02:24:55,670
My Iove is being snatched
away from me, my friend.

2049
02:24:56,371 --> 02:24:59,772
That rascaI DK has pIayed

02:25:04,479 --> 02:25:06,276
..secondIy Kiran is
not taking my caII.

2052

Then you go over to

2053
02:25:09,551 --> 02:25:12,452
For one her father is

2054
02:25:13,655 --> 02:25:16,283
I don't know what to do?

2055
02:25:17,392 --> 02:25:19,292

I wiII catch you aII.

2099
02:28:14,069 --> 02:28:17,630
I wiII cut you aII into pieces.
I wiII kiII you aII.

2100
02:28:17,739 --> 02:28:19,639
Aunty, controI yourseIf,
everything wiII be aIright.

2101
02:28:19,741 --> 02:28:22,471
Look, I know where they
have taken Kiran. - You?

2102
02:28:22,577 --> 02:28:25,137
You come with me in the car,
I wiII teII you everything.

2103
02:28:25,246 --> 02:28:27,111
Come, come with me,
Iet's not waste time.

2104
02:28:27,215 --> 02:28:29,809
What had you said? When
I wear the sari. - Yes.

2105
02:28:29,918 --> 02:28:32,819
He wiII pounce on me.
- Yes.

2106
02:28:32,921 --> 02:28:34,889
I have worn the sari.
- Yes.

2107
02:28:34,989 --> 02:28:37,480
Do you know what he said?
- No.

2108
02:28:37,592 --> 02:28:42,052
That he wiII take me to the tempIe.
- Oh ! - And worship me.

2109
02:28:42,163 --> 02:28:44,825
Oh !
- He wiII pray to me. - Wow!

2110
02:28:44,933 --> 02:28:47,902
Logic, Mr. Commissioner,
there is a Iogic behind this too.

2111
02:28:48,002 --> 02:28:51,494
I'm sure he is a..
is a reIigious kiIIer.

2112
02:28:51,606 --> 02:28:54,837
''You are my mother,
father.. murder.''

2113
02:28:54,943 --> 02:28:59,004
You scoundreI! You get him
treated from a good doctor.

2114
02:28:59,114 --> 02:29:00,513
It's enough.

2115
02:29:02,217 --> 02:29:04,845
Sir.
- Yes, teII me constabIe.

2116
02:29:05,620 --> 02:29:09,522
And.. - Okay. BIock the roads aII
over. And keep me informed.

2117
02:29:09,624 --> 02:29:11,922
Okay.

2118
02:29:14,629 --> 02:29:16,859
One more murder has taken pIace.

2119
02:29:17,632 --> 02:29:19,532
Near the tempIe.

2120
02:29:19,634 --> 02:29:22,933
And this time that
Iady had worn a sari.

2121
02:29:24,038 --> 02:29:27,872
But sir.. - Now what do you have
to say, inspector UrmiIa Martodkar?

2122
02:29:28,643 --> 02:29:33,876
You were chaIIenging Dr.
ScrewwaIa's theories, his knowIedge..

2123
02:29:33,982 --> 02:29:35,711
Did you see?

2124
02:29:35,817 --> 02:29:37,944
AII this has
happened because of you.

2125
02:29:38,653 --> 02:29:41,952
If you were with him for
some more time, wearing a sari..

2126
02:29:42,056 --> 02:29:44,547
..then his attack wouId not
have been on a heIpIess woman..

2127
02:29:44,659 --> 02:29:46,559
..but on a trained poIice officer.

2128
02:29:46,661 --> 02:29:48,959
Now you teII me, do I
need treatment or you?

2129
02:29:49,063 --> 02:29:50,553
But sir, this does not mean that..

2130
02:29:50,665 --> 02:29:52,565
Enough, UrmiIa! There is
no need to argue anymore.

2131
02:29:52,667 --> 02:29:56,899
Take the poIice unit immediateIy
and keep an eye on that buiIding.

2132
02:30:01,676 --> 02:30:04,907
Come on. Come on. Let it
go. Come on. Hurry up!

2133
02:30:06,781 --> 02:30:09,750
Come on. - Oh God! - It is fine.
It is fine. Let it go.

2134
02:30:09,851 --> 02:30:11,910
It seems that DK has great contacts.

2135
02:30:13,288 --> 02:30:18,089
But DK, your waII might be
buiId of Ambuja cement aIso..

2136
02:30:18,193 --> 02:30:22,926
..today, I wiII definiteIy break
it. I wiII definiteIy break it.

2137
02:30:35,043 --> 02:30:36,943
Hey! Hey! Get hoId of him!
Don't Iet him escape.

2138
02:30:37,812 --> 02:30:40,610
Hurry up! Sit in the car.
FoIIow him. Come on.

2139
02:30:40,715 --> 02:30:43,616
FoIIow that scum. Hey! Hey!
Don't shoot. I wiII be kiIIed.

2140
02:30:44,719 --> 02:30:45,777
These poIice officers are
kiIIing another poIice officer..

2141
02:30:45,887 --> 02:30:46,945
..in an encounter.
Hey! Come on, be quick.

2142
02:30:47,055 --> 02:30:49,785
Get down and run ! Sir,
the jeep is not starting.

2143
02:30:50,725 --> 02:30:51,783
Oh ! These peopIe give us
such degraded vehicIes..

2144
02:30:51,893 --> 02:30:52,951
..and then they question us onIy..

2145
02:30:53,061 --> 02:30:56,292
..that why do the poIice officers
often come Iate in the cIimax?

2146
02:30:56,397 --> 02:30:58,228
'How come it's become so Iate?'

2147
02:30:58,333 --> 02:31:00,801
'The sun has aIready risen
and he has not yet come.'

2148
02:31:00,902 --> 02:31:04,633
Sir, I am teIIing you right now I
don't know how to do marriages.

2149
02:31:04,739 --> 02:31:06,639
I am an expert in carrying
out the finaI rites. - Hey!

2150
02:31:06,741 --> 02:31:08,231
There is not much difference
between the two. Understood?

2151
02:31:08,343 --> 02:31:09,640
You quietIy go ahead and read it.

2152
02:31:09,744 --> 02:31:12,804
You took the garIand from that
corpse. That's not a good thing.

2153
02:31:12,914 --> 02:31:16,816
Hey, priest! I wiII sIap you.
You wiII be a dead man !

2154
02:31:16,918 --> 02:31:18,647
Do as I say!

2155
02:31:20,755 --> 02:31:22,154
No. No. No.

2156
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:28,058
Karan !
- A ghost has arrived. Let's go.

2157
02:31:28,162 --> 02:31:30,653
That is not a ghost.
It is my Iove. Sit down.

2158
02:31:30,765 --> 02:31:34,166
Read the chants. RahuI! You have
gift wrapped her and brought! Nice!

2159
02:31:34,369 --> 02:31:36,837
Sister-in-Iaw had faIIen down.
She had fainted. - What?

2160
02:31:36,938 --> 02:31:39,998
Let aII that be. You hurry
up! DK is coming behind us.

2161
02:31:40,108 --> 02:31:43,168
DK! Okay, come Iet's take the
sacred rounds. You come. You come.

2162
02:31:44,779 --> 02:31:46,269
Who wiII fuIfiI the Iast rites?
- Last rites!

2163
02:31:46,381 --> 02:31:47,678
Giving away! Giving away!

2164
02:31:47,782 --> 02:31:49,682
He wiII onIy do the giving
away ceremony. You continue.

2165
02:31:50,218 --> 02:31:51,685
Read quickIy.

2166
02:31:52,787 --> 02:31:54,687
What nonsense is he saying?

2167
02:31:55,790 --> 02:31:59,021
He is gone crazy.
- What is happening?

2168
02:31:59,127 --> 02:32:00,856
We have arrived on time.

2169
02:32:00,962 --> 02:32:03,863
Karan ! Karan ! Wait! AII
this is wrong. PIease wait!

2170
02:32:03,965 --> 02:32:05,694
Nothing is wrong. If anyone
wiII come between Kiran and me..

2171
02:32:05,800 --> 02:32:07,097
..I wiII kiII them.

2172
02:32:07,201 --> 02:32:10,034
Even I wiII kiII everyone.

2173
02:32:10,138 --> 02:32:11,196
I am an expert in
doing the finaI rites.

2174
02:32:11,306 --> 02:32:12,364
We wiII cremate them together.
- Shut up!

2175
02:32:12,473 --> 02:32:14,873
Hand over Kiran to me! - Over to
you. - Yes. Kiran is my first Iove.

2176
02:32:14,976 --> 02:32:17,206
Get Iost! Kiran is my Iove.

2177
02:32:17,312 --> 02:32:21,112
Hey! What is happening? You
had said you were Kiran's friend.

2178
02:32:21,215 --> 02:32:23,206
Yes. I am her friend too.
Hand over Kiran to me.

2179
02:32:24,919 --> 02:32:26,887
Now say what you want to say.

2180
02:32:26,988 --> 02:32:29,889
Karan, now you get married
to her in front of him onIy.

2181
02:32:29,991 --> 02:32:33,051
No. no, Karan. - Look, today don't
come between us. Let go of my hand.

2182
02:32:33,161 --> 02:32:34,389
Karan, don't do time pass.
Just put the vermiIion on..

2183
02:32:34,495 --> 02:32:35,894
..her forehead.
- Today, Kiran wiII be mine.

2184
02:32:35,997 --> 02:32:37,726
Karan, what is this you are doing?
- Kiran !

2185
02:32:38,833 --> 02:32:43,270
''When I saw you, when
I got friendIy to you.''

2186
02:32:46,841 --> 02:32:49,901
Get up! Hey! Whom have you brought?
You were getting me married to him!

2187
02:32:50,111 --> 02:32:52,739
Idiot! Kiran !

2194
02:33:10,865 --> 02:33:14,164
We have onIy come to take bIessings.

2195
02:33:14,268 --> 02:33:17,101
Run away! - Bhabhi, come on. I had
brought someone eIse in your pIace.

2196
02:33:17,205 --> 02:33:19,105
Good you come. Come on. Come on.

Bhabhi? Who is Bhabhi?
Whose Bhabhi? - His Bhabhi.

2198
02:33:21,042 --> 02:33:22,270
Come on, Iet's go and get married.

What are you doing? Leave my hand.

2202
02:33:30,885 --> 02:33:33,786
Karan, save Kiran !
- I am saving Kiran onIy.

2203
02:33:33,888 --> 02:33:36,118
Hey! Kiran is there.
- Hey! Kiran is here.

2204
02:33:36,224 --> 02:33:38,124
Hey! I am not Kiran. I am Naina.
- Naina?

2205
02:33:38,226 --> 02:33:40,126
Oh gosh ! Karan, that

2206
02:33:40,228 --> 02:33:41,957
I know Kiran is your..

2207
02:33:43,498 --> 02:33:46,126
Kiran is your brother?

2208
02:33:46,234 --> 02:33:47,963
Yes.

2209
02:33:51,906 --> 02:33:54,136
That means..
- Come on, Naina. Come on, quickIy.

2210
02:33:55,343 --> 02:33:57,811
AII those messages?

2211
02:33:57,912 --> 02:34:00,813
I had sent aII those
messages and those kisses too.

2212
02:34:05,453 --> 02:34:07,978
You did not know that
Kiran was a boy, isn't it?

2213
02:34:08,523 --> 02:34:10,991
Then with whom did you do aII that?
- What?

2214
02:34:11,359 --> 02:34:14,157
One wiId.. One night stand.

2215
02:34:14,262 --> 02:34:16,162
What?
- ShaII I teII her?

2216
02:34:16,264 --> 02:34:18,824
Because of you, I
kidnapped a boy today..

2217
02:34:18,933 --> 02:34:20,833
..if my girIfriend comes to know?

2218
02:34:20,935 --> 02:34:22,994
Now who is this.. my girIfriend.

2219
02:34:23,104 --> 02:34:25,004
My wouId-be sister-in-Iaw.

2220
02:34:25,206 --> 02:34:28,175
By the way, you have checked
everything eIse, isn't it?

2221
02:34:28,276 --> 02:34:30,244
I am not Iike you to
take such a big risk.

2222
02:34:30,344 --> 02:34:32,835
With open eyes, when I
asked for someone's heart..

2223
02:34:32,947 --> 02:34:34,847
..then I got a sIap on my cheek.

2224
02:34:36,050 --> 02:34:37,847
And aII this is because of you.

2225
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:40,352
If in coIIege, you had not
spread the stories of your..

2226
02:34:40,455 --> 02:34:42,355
..one night stand then you wouIdn't
have got a sIap on your cheek.

2227
02:34:44,959 --> 02:34:48,019
Can I say something to you?
- Go ahead.

2228
02:34:49,964 --> 02:34:52,194
WiII you be my time pass?

2229
02:34:53,301 --> 02:34:56,862

- For a Iifetime.

2230
02:35:03,578 --> 02:35:05,375
Sex. I mean yes.

2231
02:35:05,480 --> 02:35:08,040
So teII me, where shouId I
Ieave you? - Leave me to destiny.

2232
02:35:08,149 --> 02:35:11,880
Greetings! We have just got news

2234
02:35:15,323 --> 02:35:17,883
..that seriaI kiIIer
has been identified.

2235
02:35:17,992 --> 02:35:20,290
This is the brutaI murderer.

2236
02:35:20,394 --> 02:35:23,227
If you have any

2237
02:35:23,331 --> 02:35:26,232
..then do not forget to

2238
02:35:32,006 --> 02:35:33,906
HeIIo. Who is speaking?

02:35:34,008 --> 02:35:35,908
Uma Shankar Tripathi.

2240
02:35:38,946 --> 02:35:40,914
Two rupees for a stone.
Two rupees for a stone.

2241
02:35:41,015 --> 02:35:42,482
Hey, stone vendor.
Take these two rupees.

2242
02:35:42,583 --> 02:35:44,073
And give me a big stone.
Just watch my aim.

2243
02:35:44,185 --> 02:35:47,086
Oh ! Commissioner, just see.

2244
02:35:47,188 --> 02:35:50,919
He is not fond of onIy
coIIecting the body parts of woman.

2245
02:35:51,025 --> 02:35:53,255
But he coIIects their cIothes too.

2246
02:35:53,361 --> 02:35:55,921
There must be sureIy Iogic
behind this. - There is.

2247
02:35:56,130 --> 02:35:58,098
This is my bag.

2248
02:35:58,199 --> 02:36:00,099
Oh ! I am sorry.

2249
02:36:00,301 --> 02:36:03,099
Fix the camera in the
front. Cover from here.

2250
02:36:04,639 --> 02:36:07,437
Brother, what is going on? Is
shooting going on over here?

2251
02:36:07,542 --> 02:36:10,443
I don't know. Everybody is
Iooking up. So even I am Iooking up.

2252
02:36:10,545 --> 02:36:12,945
It's a bank hoIiday,
brother. So even you Iook up.

2253

Brother, that rascaI who

2265
02:36:42,076 --> 02:36:43,976
I have not done anything.

2266
02:36:46,080 --> 02:36:48,310
He is the murderer.
- What are you aII saying?

2267
02:36:48,416 --> 02:36:49,974
Catch him! He is the murderer!

2268
02:37:15,443 --> 02:37:18,344
Battery. - Engine. - Battery.
- Engine. - Battery. - Engine.

2269
02:37:21,115 --> 02:37:22,514
Rickshaw!

2270
02:37:27,121 --> 02:37:29,351
Where has he gone?
Where has he gone?

2271
02:37:39,133 --> 02:37:42,432
Hey! He is there. Catch him.

2272
02:38:00,421 --> 02:38:02,218
Stop! Stop! Stop!
PIease. PIease stop.

2273
02:38:03,157 --> 02:38:07,059
''I am in troubIe. Waiting to pee.''

2274
02:38:19,173 --> 02:38:21,073
What? How is this possibIe?

2275
02:38:21,175 --> 02:38:23,234
Even I don't understand anything.

2276
02:38:28,182 --> 02:38:31,083
RahuI. RahuI, come quickIy.
Sit in the car.

2277
02:38:35,523 --> 02:38:38,083
Come on Sawant! QuickIy. The
poIice wiII get hoId of us.

2278
02:38:38,192 --> 02:38:40,092
What happened?

2279
02:38:40,194 --> 02:38:43,095
AII the petroI is exhausted.
- You idiot!

2280
02:38:47,201 --> 02:38:50,261
If I'II know anything then I'II Iet
you know, right? I myseIf am worried.

2281
02:38:55,309 --> 02:38:58,437
UrmiIa? In an inspector's uniform?

2282
02:39:00,214 --> 02:39:02,114
Do you know her?
- Hey!

2283
02:39:02,216 --> 02:39:05,276
She is the one who is going to
be your future sister-in-Iaw.

2284
02:39:05,386 --> 02:39:07,616
What?
- Madam. - Yes.

2285
02:39:10,224 --> 02:39:12,454
Come on. Come outside.

2286
02:39:16,564 --> 02:39:19,795
UrmiIa, this.. - Say
inspector Martodkar. - What is this?

2287
02:39:19,900 --> 02:39:22,130
Sit down in the jeep.
Don't taIk too much. Come.

2288
02:39:22,236 --> 02:39:25,205
Come. Come on. Go and sit behind.

2289
02:39:27,341 --> 02:39:30,139
Wait! Wait!

2290
02:39:30,244 --> 02:39:33,475
Wait! Wait! Madam, I am
Ieft behind. Take me aIong.

2291
02:39:33,681 --> 02:39:36,149
Wait! Wait!

2292
02:39:36,250 --> 02:39:39,481
Wait! Wait!
- What?

2293
02:39:39,587 --> 02:39:42,818
UrmiIa has taken him?
Good. Very good.

2294
02:39:42,923 --> 02:39:46,324
And you as aIways
come back empty handed.

2295
02:39:46,427 --> 02:39:50,659
Mr. Commissioner, what are
you doing sir? - hoId on.

2296
02:39:50,765 --> 02:39:52,494
Think about the Iogic, sir.

2297
02:39:52,600 --> 02:39:54,329
She is arrested in his Iove.

2298
02:39:54,435 --> 02:39:57,165
In stead of the poIice station,
she wiII take him to the..

2299
02:39:57,271 --> 02:39:59,330
..raiIway station and from there,
they wiII both escape.

2300
02:39:59,440 --> 02:40:01,340
The train wiII run
on aII my efforts.

2301
02:40:01,442 --> 02:40:04,502
ConstabIe.
- Yes. - FoIIow UrmiIa. Run !

2302
02:40:04,612 --> 02:40:07,342
Take care of this.
It's a Ieft hand drive.

2303
02:40:07,448 --> 02:40:09,507
HoId it Iike this.
- Stop. Stop.

2304
02:40:10,284 --> 02:40:13,344
But UrmiIa, I have not done
any rape or I have.. - I know.

2305
02:40:13,454 --> 02:40:16,355
That's why I have come
to take you from here.

2306
02:40:16,457 --> 02:40:17,685
We wiII have to escape from here.

2307
02:40:17,792 --> 02:40:19,692
But when we have not done anything
wrong then why shouId we escape?

2308
02:40:19,794 --> 02:40:21,193
Because everybody is
suspicious about you.

2309
02:40:21,295 --> 02:40:23,695
Once we find the true cuIprit.

2310
02:40:40,314 --> 02:40:43,545
Listen commissioner, you
either trust ScrewwaIa..

2311
02:40:43,651 --> 02:40:45,380
..or you don't trust ScrewwaIa.
- Screw..

2312
02:40:45,486 --> 02:40:48,216
This Uma Shankar
Tripathi is his own man.

2313
02:40:48,322 --> 02:40:50,552
And he is trying to misguide us.

2314
02:40:50,758 --> 02:40:53,556
But Dr. ScrewwaIa for once..
- Sir.

2315
02:40:53,661 --> 02:40:56,562
SaIutations!

2316
02:40:57,331 --> 02:40:59,390
SaIutations!

2317
02:40:59,500 --> 02:41:02,628
Uma Shankar! He
had caIIed, isn't it?

2318
02:41:02,736 --> 02:41:05,227
You aII are retired.
You aII don't remember.

2319
02:41:12,346 --> 02:41:16,407
You had said you know about
the kiIIer. - Yes, I know.

2320
02:41:16,517 --> 02:41:19,577
I wiII not teII you Iike that.

2321
02:41:19,687 --> 02:41:22,247
Then how wiII you teII us?

2322
02:41:22,356 --> 02:41:25,257
Look, this is very hot news.

2323
02:41:25,359 --> 02:41:28,260
And I wish at such a time
aII the hot media peopIe..

2324
02:41:28,362 --> 02:41:30,262
..and the hot channeI peopIe..

2325
02:41:30,364 --> 02:41:33,595
..aII the hot radio channeI peopIe,
aII the hot press peopIe.

2326
02:41:33,701 --> 02:41:36,261
AII the peopIe shouId be present.

2327
02:41:39,373 --> 02:41:42,672
Everyone has been caIIed.
- That everyone has come.

2328
02:41:42,776 --> 02:41:47,440
Yes. Now wiII you teII us what do
you know about the murderer?

2329
02:41:48,382 --> 02:41:51,681
He used to Iive in a smaII viIIage.

2330
02:41:52,386 --> 02:41:56,288
One day his father said
an ordinary man's name..

2331
02:41:56,390 --> 02:41:58,790
..can be popuIar onIy in two ways.

2332
02:41:59,393 --> 02:42:02,624
One is on the wedding card
with the father's name..

2333
02:42:02,730 --> 02:42:07,292
..and the second is after he
dies in the prayer meeting.

2334
02:42:07,501 --> 02:42:11,301
That's it! Then he decided that
he wiII make himseIf popuIar..

2335
02:42:11,405 --> 02:42:15,637
..on the basis of his own efforts.

2336
02:42:15,743 --> 02:42:19,304
If you are certain that I am
innocent then stop the car, UrmiIa.

2337
02:42:22,416 --> 02:42:25,647
When you are with me then I
don't care about the worId.

2338
02:42:26,420 --> 02:42:28,479
Nobody can do anything to me.
Nothing can happen to me.

2339
02:42:28,589 --> 02:42:31,387
Because you are my fate.

2340
02:42:31,492 --> 02:42:33,653
My destiny.

2341
02:42:34,428 --> 02:42:37,488
And now, Iet me test my destiny.

2342
02:42:37,698 --> 02:42:39,495
I don't know anything eIse.

2343
02:42:39,867 --> 02:42:43,496
How do I know so
much about the murderer?

2344
02:42:52,713 --> 02:42:55,341
Because I am the murderer.

2345
02:42:55,449 --> 02:42:58,350
Uma Shankar Tripathi! That's me.

2346
02:43:07,728 --> 02:43:09,355
He is showing us something.

2347
02:43:11,465 --> 02:43:13,695
It's empty.

2348
02:43:15,469 --> 02:43:19,701
I knew that you wouId not
beIieve that I was invoIved in it.

2349
02:43:19,807 --> 02:43:21,775
That's why I have brought this hand.

2350
02:43:21,875 --> 02:43:24,366
Look at this. Where
has the finger gone?

2351
02:43:24,478 --> 02:43:27,379
By the way, the
finger is very dangerous.

2352
02:43:28,482 --> 02:43:31,781
Here.. Here, it is.

2353
02:43:32,019 --> 02:43:34,385
Sir. Sir.

2354
02:43:34,488 --> 02:43:36,388
Where have they gone?

2355
02:43:43,097 --> 02:43:46,396
Yes sir. He is in front of my eyes.

2356
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:47,899
I wiII catch him.
- What?

2357
02:43:58,512 --> 02:44:00,480
Why did they aII turn back?

2358
02:44:01,115 --> 02:44:03,413
The priest had
said the right thing..

2359
02:44:03,517 --> 02:44:06,418
..that you came and my
destiny took a turn.

2360
02:44:06,854 --> 02:44:12,053
I knew that he was committing aII
those murders just for recognition !

2361
02:44:12,526 --> 02:44:14,756
And I snatched that
very thing from him!

2362
02:44:14,962 --> 02:44:18,591
I bIamed someone eIse for aII that!

2363
02:44:19,533 --> 02:44:22,434
I got big posters of
that man printed..

2364
02:44:22,536 --> 02:44:25,767
..and got them
pasted aII over the city..

2365
02:44:25,873 --> 02:44:27,932
..and the kiIIer
wasn't abIe to bear it!

2366
02:44:29,810 --> 02:44:33,837
And.. as I toId Mr. Commissioner..

2367
02:44:34,548 --> 02:44:38,450
..that kiIIer.. has
come aII the way..

2368
02:44:38,552 --> 02:44:41,612
..and is here to surrender himseIf.

2369
02:44:41,722 --> 02:44:43,952
Right, Commissioner? Right.
Thank you. Next question pIease.

2370
02:44:44,058 --> 02:44:45,525
Who eIse was invoIved
with you in this mission?

2371
02:44:45,626 --> 02:44:48,789
Nice question.
Madam, to soIve any case..

2372
02:44:48,896 --> 02:44:53,458
..Dr. ScrewwaIa
doesn't need anybody's..

2373
02:44:53,567 --> 02:44:58,470
..of course I need.

2374
02:44:58,572 --> 02:45:00,096
And this that boId and brave..

2375
02:45:00,207 --> 02:45:04,871
..Inspector UrmiIa Martodkar!

2376
02:45:07,581 --> 02:45:08,980
Sir, where's the boy..

2377
02:45:09,083 --> 02:45:12,143
..whose posters you got
pasted in the whoIe city?

2378
02:45:12,252 --> 02:45:14,812
He was a sociaI worker.
He worked for the society.

2379
02:45:14,922 --> 02:45:16,822
And went back to the society.

2380
02:45:17,591 --> 02:45:19,889
No, sir. He's very
much with us. Over here.

2381
02:45:20,594 --> 02:45:23,654
Mr. Commissioner.. the
time's up.. pIease..

2382
02:45:23,764 --> 02:45:27,666
Yeah, yeah. So now we
present that deadIy kiIIer..

2383
02:45:27,768 --> 02:45:32,671
..Uma Shankar Tripathi!

2384
02:45:32,773 --> 02:45:34,832
''HaiI the Lord!''

2385
02:45:38,612 --> 02:45:40,842
Excuse me! PIease!

2386
02:45:42,216 --> 02:45:44,514
Why has the band been
ordered for Uma Shankar?

2387
02:45:44,618 --> 02:45:47,678
It has to be, sir.
- But why?

2388
02:45:47,788 --> 02:45:49,688
He might become a minister some day.

2389
02:45:49,790 --> 02:45:52,691
Sir, teII us.. what was the
motive behind aII the kiIIings?

2390
02:45:52,793 --> 02:45:56,695
There was no motive.. it's
just that they were aII fraiI!

2391
02:45:56,797 --> 02:46:00,927
No, no.. Objective?
What was the objective?

2392
02:46:01,034 --> 02:46:02,194
The objective was to
make a career in poIitics.

2393
02:46:02,302 --> 02:46:03,530
It's very much crystaI cIear.

2394
02:46:03,637 --> 02:46:05,696
You need an MCOM
certificate to become a peon..

2395
02:46:05,806 --> 02:46:07,603
..and for poIitics you
need a criminaI record.

2396
02:46:07,708 --> 02:46:09,699
And, my criminaI record is very
much ready. - But, the Commissioner..

2397
02:46:09,810 --> 02:46:12,608
..was saying that the motive
behind the kiIIings was sex?

2398
02:46:12,713 --> 02:46:14,544
The commissioner's gone mad! WiII you
Iisten to aII that he says?! - Yes.

2399
02:46:14,648 --> 02:46:16,548
I can buy this from anywhere!
WiII you beIieve it?

2400
02:46:16,650 --> 02:46:19,710
I said the same thing to him.
- You said the same thing? - Yeah.

2401
02:46:19,820 --> 02:46:22,550
You seem to be from my viIIage.
Brother you too ask a question.

2402
02:46:22,656 --> 02:46:24,886
I'm reaIIy enjoying it!

2403
02:46:27,661 --> 02:46:30,152
You rascaI! The rooster
does aII the hard-work..

2404
02:46:30,264 --> 02:46:31,891
..and the beggar eats the egg?!

2405
02:46:31,999 --> 02:46:34,729
I did aII those kiIIings and
you're getting the credit?!

2406
02:46:34,835 --> 02:46:37,565
He's not a criminaI!
I'm the criminaI!

2407
02:46:37,671 --> 02:46:40,902
Bastards! I'II commit one more
crime! I'II definiteIy kiII someone!

2408
02:46:41,008 --> 02:46:42,566
I don't know him!

2409
02:46:42,676 --> 02:46:45,736
Listen.. the whoIe worId
wants to Iisten to you.

2410
02:46:45,846 --> 02:46:47,905
But, I have never seen him. Never

2411
02:46:48,015 --> 02:46:49,573
Why have you come to me?

2412
02:46:51,685 --> 02:46:54,586
I don't know anything.. why
have they brought me here?

2413
02:46:54,688 --> 02:46:55,746
I simpIy have a Laundy..

2414
