1
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,125
How much more time?
We're getting late for office

2
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,375
Sir, send the crane fast.
Sir, traffic is gone high

3
00:03:06,583 --> 00:03:07,291
Remove it, I must go to college

4
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,875
Why not get crane and
remove that top?

5
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:09,666
Please, we're on the same job

6
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:13,291
Bring it fast, sir.
What is this late, sir?

7
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:26,833
(Song playing)

8
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:49,958
If I stay here any longer,
my ears might bleed.

9
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:51,416
I am telling you, right?
It will come.

10
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:12,958
How can you step in..?

11
00:04:13,916 --> 00:04:15,916
Riding an auto isn’t just about sitting
in that seat of yours;

12
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,666
when necessary, you might have to
squeeze in every nook and cranny.

13
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:18,583
Get lost!

14
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:22,666
Sir, send the crane fast.
Sir, traffic is gone high

15
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:29,291
I am getting late for the office.
What's all this?

16
00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:32,166
When will the crane come and how long
would it take to clear the traffic?

17
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,833
How much longer do we have to wait, sir?

18
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:35,916
Just a minute... please wait.

19
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:36,958
Who drives this?

20
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:37,958
Me.

21
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:42,708
Goodness! How did you manage
to squeeze it in there?

22
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,041
It doesn’t look like this is going
to be resolved soon.

23
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,666
Why don’t you get into the vehicle
and start it? I’ll instruct you.

24
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,041
We did start and tried our best to
move it but that didn’t work out.

25
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:55,166
Why do you worry about that?
It will move.

26
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,416
Just get into the vehicle and start it, and
put it in reverse. I’ll instruct you. Go on.

27
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,000
Sir, the problem is resolved.

28
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,458
Yes, go on! Reverse it!

29
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:56,541
They are fretting over something
this insignificant. What say?!

30
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,541
Sir, the problem is resolved.

31
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,833
Brother, you solved such a huge mess
fairly quickly.

32
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,083
You are awesome!

33
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,041
Well, I didn’t really study much.

34
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,875
If I did, I would have the same
sort of thinking as them.

35
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,166
It’s because I didn’t study, I have
a limited way of dealing with things.

36
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,250
You are correct, brother.

37
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,083
Isn’t it?

38
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:16,291
All the big problems usually have
very simple solutions.

39
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:20,208
Well, since you know a lot, why didn’t
you just remove the air from the tyre?

40
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,750
Why did you stab it and puncture it?

41
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,916
Well, he put a lot of people through
a lot of agony.

42
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,708
If I just removed the air from his tyres, he
will surely go and recreate this mess elsewhere.

43
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:30,500
But if I punctured his tyre,
he will remember the lesson.

44
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:31,958
He should learn his lesson, right?

45
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,583
Well said, brother!

46
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:34,750
I will remember it too.

47
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:35,500
What’s your name?

48
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:36,250
Raju.

49
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,541
Basti Balraju.

50
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,916
Aunt, would it have killed you to squeeze
a bit more lemon into the stew?

51
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:06,125
Yeah, right! Like there is a lot to life!

52
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Here, come.
Take it and squeeze it yourself.

53
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,833
I wonder what’s going on with me, aunt.
I feel like eating a lot of tangy flavored dishes.

54
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:23,416
Maybe it’s ‘cause you got pregnant instead
of Rama Lakshmi who was supposed to.

55
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,041
It was my mistake telling you things.
I should punish myself!

56
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,625
Do you want me to help?

57
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,625
I just thought your mom was on my case.
Are you going to join her?

58
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,541
What’s up, mother?
How was business today?

59
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,208
Not bad. Well, there were few sales.
That’s all.

60
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,500
What about you?

61
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:41,291
How many dead bodies did you drive?

62
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,791
A lucky three died today.

63
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:43,958
Alright.

64
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,625
Did you bring your father’s medicines?

65
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,416
It wasn’t possible today.
I will bring it tomorrow.

66
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,208
Hello?

67
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:07,500
Is this the funeral service?

68
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,458
Gosh, speak in Telugu.

69
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:11,333
One of our relatives passed away.

70
00:08:11,541 --> 00:08:13,083
He needs to be transported to the cemetery.

71
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,291
We are Christians.

72
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,875
Would you mind driving our kind?

73
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,625
If you pay, we would transport anyone.

74
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,041
Tell me the address.

75
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,041
Alright. Come near the Saibaba temple
at Akkaipalam at 10 o’clock in

76
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,708
the morning and give me a call.

77
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:24,791
I will give you the address.

78
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,416
Alright.

79
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,166
Son, hurry and get your father’s medicines.

80
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,666
Don’t make me run those errands now.

81
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,625
If necessary, I will get those for you
on my way back.

82
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:42,916
You said the same thing yesterday as well.

83
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,500
Do you wish for you father to sit and
keep waiting for you to get his medicines?

84
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:48,125
Why do you say he is waiting sitting down?
He is lying down, isn’t it?

85
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,791
What’s the worst that could happen
if he skips his meds for half a day?

86
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,291
At the worst, he may die.

87
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,666
If he has to die, let him.

88
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,041
How long should he suffer being
bedridden and all?

89
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:58,041
How could you speak such nonsense
about your father?

90
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,666
Gosh! If you have time, go and
get those meds for him.

91
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,750
There is a dead body waiting for me.

92
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,833
Where can a dead body go?
It will stay dead.

93
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:07,208
Goodness! Stop nagging me!

94
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,083
Just go about your business.

95
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,750
What’s your problem, father?!

96
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:14,708
Water?

97
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,333
Why would you just keep gulping
down water?

98
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,375
Here, take this bottle of rum.

99
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,333
You will get up in a jiffy!

100
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:23,041
Son! Son! Son!

101
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:24,541
Buffalo headed fellow!

102
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,416
Have you lost your mind?

103
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:29,500
Why would you give rum to someone
who is sick and bedridden?

104
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,041
Do you want some?

105
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,833
I will thrash the shit out of you!

106
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,875
Get lost! Useless fellow!

107
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,000
Alright, fine. I’ll leave.

108
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:40,833
Son! That’s my bottle.

109
00:09:41,166 --> 00:09:42,083
Give it back and then, leave.

110
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:11,833
I was the one who called you.

111
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:12,791
My name is Thomas.

112
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:14,916
Are you loading the body into the vehicle
or is it going to take some time?

113
00:10:14,916 --> 00:10:15,833
It will take about 5 minutes.

114
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:17,625
Bro! Do you want me to wipe it?

115
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,458
Okay.

116
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,041
Peter!

117
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,458
Have some coffee.

118
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:23,291
Who is that girl? She is bawling her eyes out.

119
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,875
Such a pity. See that dead man lying there?

120
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:26,250
She is his wife.

121
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,083
She is the daughter-in-law of this house.

122
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,541
She lost her husband at a very young age.

123
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,041
Brother, we came here for a funeral.

124
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,375
It’s done. I am not looking at the dead body.

125
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,208
When one attends a funeral,
one sees the dead body.

126
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,291
Not the women who cries beside
the dead body.

127
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:23,000
Madam...money?

128
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:25,083
Do you have any sense?

129
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,416
Why would you ask her money?

130
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:27,250
We are all right here, isn’t it?

131
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,291
We will give it.

132
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:31,375
Well, since it’s her husband
who passed away,

133
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,125
it would be better if she gave the money.

134
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,625
How much?

135
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:41,541
According to how much it pleases you.

136
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:42,833
However much you want to give.

137
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,333
Pleases her?!

138
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:46,375
We are heartbroken and sad because
one of us died.

139
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,125
This isn’t what pleases me.

140
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:50,625
This is my pain.

141
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,500
Don’t be so sad, madam. I like you a lot.

142
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,875
If you agree, I want to get married to you.

143
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:04,791
You scumbag!

144
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,583
Why are you hitting me?

145
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,375
What's there in wrong in to marry her.

146
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,083
Catch him!

Mother, why would you badmouth yourself?

161

I will stuff your mouth with dirt!
Shut up!

162
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:36,000
He was asked to transport a dead body
but he went and flirted with the widow.

163
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,916
Since her husband is dead, she is single.

164
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:40,916
What horrid fate!

165
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:46,083
Cousin, looking at you,
I remember an old saying –

166
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,791
A widow sits mourning her husband,
an adulterer comes makes at her.

167
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,791
If anyone makes a pass at her,
I will break their teeth.

168
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,916
If you were in my position,
you would understand.

169
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:57,208
It’s very difficult not to fall for that girl.

170
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:58,541
It isn’t easy if you fall for her either.

171
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,916
What a cursed home!

172
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:04,750
What is it about her that you liked so much
that you are unable to keep your clothes on?!

173
00:17:04,958 --> 00:17:09,500
Don’t feed us crap that you like her eyes,
her teeth or her smile.

174
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:12,750
A girl who dazzles when she smiles
are dime a dozen.

175
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,458
I go to funerals every day.

176
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,458
That is what I do every day.

177
00:17:18,291 --> 00:17:22,083
My goodness! Watching people cry just jaded
me to the concept of mourning and crying.

178
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:29,291
But when I saw that girl crying,
the hair on my hands stood up.

179
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,666
[laughing] only the hair on his hands or...

180
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:34,541
Shut up! Dirty fellow!

181
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:39,041
Goosebumps...that’s what I mean.

182
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,791
I felt that her husband died just
to make way for me.

183
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:51,041
That is why I was impatient and
proposed to her.

184
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,458
Son, it’s not right.

185
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,250
The girl is in pain.

186
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:59,833
That’s true, mother.
You reminded me well.

187
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,333
Why am I here when she is in pain?

188
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,541
I’ll go and pay her a visit.

189
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:07,708
Aunty...

190
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,750
I am starving... please serve me some more food.

191
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,333
Eat.

192
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,458
Peter would frequent this church of ours.

193
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:20,625
The fact that he is no longer with us
brings us a lot of pain.

194
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,083
You... move.

195
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,916
I wish the Lord of ours delivers
Mallika and her in-laws, I mean

196
00:18:35,958 --> 00:18:40,958
Peter’s parents, from this grave loss.

197
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,625
I promise that all of us would always
support you at all times.

198
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,500
God! He’s back!

199
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,708
Mr. Sekhar Samuel, would you like
to say something?

200
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,041
No.

201
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,500
Ms. Mary, what about you?

202
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:12,500
Mallika dear, do you wish to say
something about Peter?

203
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,125
How lovely she looks!

204
00:19:17,916 --> 00:19:19,750
How could he have died leaving
her alone here?

205
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:24,750
Peter... wherever you are...

206
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,541
you are always going to be alive in our hearts...

207
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:30,500
...forever.

208
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,125
We will miss you!

209
00:19:37,666 --> 00:19:39,125
Oh, how eloquent she is!

210
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,416
Did you not understand?

211
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,250
Yes, I did.

212
00:19:43,166 --> 00:19:44,833
I would have understood it too had
she said that in Telugu.

213
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:48,666
Peter’s grandmother would like
to share her pain with us.

214
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:50,208
[crying softly]

215
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:53,375
How could you have left us all here
and gone away, Peter?!

216
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:55,541
Oh, dear Peter!

217
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,083
You asked me to make you sweetmeats
and savory snacks.

218
00:19:59,291 --> 00:20:01,708
Now that you are gone, who am I
going to make and feed all those to?!

219
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,416
Oh, Peter! Dear, Peter!

220
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,291
I blessed that you with a lengthy
lifespan and add my years to yours

221
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,958
But now, you left us way too early!

222
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,250
Oh, Peter! Dear, Peter!

223
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,375
Oh, Peter!

224
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,083
Fool!

225
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:19,625
Wait.

226
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:21,708
Let’s not fight in the church.

227
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,708
If we fight, we would suffer a loss
of our reputations.

228
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:29,541
If there is anyone here who wishes to speak
about the affection they had for Peter,

229
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,583
please come forward.

230
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,250
Hello, everyone.

231
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:51,166
I am very happy to have to have
this opportunity to talk to you.

232
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:55,666
I wasn’t acquainted with Peter
when he was alive.

233
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,541
But I got to know him when he died.

234
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,416
I transported him to the cemetery
in my vehicle.

235
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:07,875
Looking at the affection Mallika, Peter’s
parents and his grandmother showered on him,

236
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:09,208
I feel jealous.

237
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:16,625
Brother, Peter. No matter where you are,
you don’t have to worry about our family.

238
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:21,166
I will take care of your parents like
a son, your grandmother as her grandson

239
00:21:21,291 --> 00:21:23,000
and Mallika as her...

240
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:27,000
I am there for them.

241
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:32,625
We are all here for them.

242
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:41,041
I wish that, very soon,
you reincarnate as Mallika’s child.

243
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,833
I take my leave.

244
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,958
Thanks.

245
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,666
Though you are young,
your words are very wise.

246
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,541
Now, let us all maintain two minutes
of silence for Peter.

247
00:22:09,541 --> 00:22:12,041
Hey! You called me here and
why won’t you talk?

248
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,041
I am paying my respects through
silence for Brother Peter.

249
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,791
So long?

250
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:21,125
Tell me this – are you in love with
Mallika or her dead husband?

251
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:24,458
Well, if you are in love with a person,
everything that concerns them concerns us.

252
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:25,583
How foolish!

253
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,125
Why did you ask me to come here?

254
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,166
Mallika’s family is going to
the cemetery at 10 am.

255
00:22:31,333 --> 00:22:33,375
They are going to install a cross
at Brother Peter’s grave.

256
00:22:33,708 --> 00:22:34,541
Well, if they are heading there,
let them.

257
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,583
What do you want me to do?

258
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,791
Well, let’s go there.

259
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:40,416
They are going to chase you out
like they would a dog.

260
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,166
If I am with you,
I would receive the same treatment.

261
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,416
That’s true.

262
00:22:44,875 --> 00:22:47,333
To make sure that that doesn’t happen,
we need something immediately.

263
00:22:47,416 --> 00:22:48,291
What is it?

264
00:23:18,958 --> 00:23:19,916
Unload it.

265
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:29,208
[sniffing]

266
00:23:35,041 --> 00:23:37,791
Samuel, I will return after I deal with him.

267
00:23:39,083 --> 00:23:39,875
Bobby, come with me.

268
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:40,833
Yes, sir.

269
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:45,666
Unload...

270
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:46,333
Oaky.

271
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:47,083
What is it?

272
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:48,500
Why do you keep following us?

273
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:50,500
Do you think we are jobless?

274
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,041
We didn’t come here for you.

275
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,208
Well, we found an unclaimed
dead body by the road.

276
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:55,166
So, we got it here.

277
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,041
Sir, do you think there really is
a dead body inside?

278
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,125
Hey! Who do you take us for?

279
00:24:00,333 --> 00:24:01,916
Just ‘because we are civil,
you keep running your mouth.

280
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:03,666
Show him.

281
00:24:10,958 --> 00:24:12,125
This doesn’t look like a dead body.

282
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:14,916
It looks like you’ve loaded a person who’s
sleeping peacefully into this and got him here.

283
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:19,208
Looks like this is good opportunity
I should perform well with God grace.

284
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,666
Sir, the dead body made a face.

285
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:24,708
What?

286
00:24:25,166 --> 00:24:25,833
See.

287
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:28,208
Oh my! I think they found that about my acting.

288
00:24:29,083 --> 00:24:30,833
Why does the body smell
of cigarette smoke?

289
00:24:31,208 --> 00:24:32,833
He must have died because
he smoked way too much.

290
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:36,791
What is it? Why is the cotton at
his side rather than in his nostrils?

291
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,791
It would lead to disease.
-Hey, now I am going to die truly.

292
00:24:41,083 --> 00:24:42,291
Live carefully.

293
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,208
Fine, just leave.

294
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,041
Oh God! You manage well.

295
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,333
[sneezes]

296
00:24:56,083 --> 00:24:58,791
Hey!

297
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,333
Useless fellows! Stop right there!

298
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:20,500
Why are you looking at me?

299
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:21,458
Go and catch them.

300
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:35,875
What is it?

301
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:39,916
Did you sneak into Rama Lakshmi’s
house again and got caught by her dad?

302
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:41,750
Looks like he thrashed you well
before letting you go.

303
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,791
No matter how many times I tell you,
you feel no shame.

304
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:46,166
Not me, aunt. It’s your son
who feels no shame.

305
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:50,666
Tell me. Did my parents give birth to
me for themselves or for this family?

306
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,750
He is the one who creates a mess and
I am at the receiving end of it.

307
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:54,708
This is unfair!

308
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,583
Exactly like his father!

309
00:25:58,541 --> 00:25:59,291
Enough with that aunt!

310
00:25:59,583 --> 00:26:01,500
Just because uncle is bed ridden
and cannot argue his case,

311
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:03,208
don’t make him responsible for everything.

312
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:07,958
Uncle, I am on your side. Stop that noise.

313
00:26:08,041 --> 00:26:12,291
Aunt, this is my polite request. Ask your
son to stop following that widow around.

314
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,791
Son, your wish to marry a woman
who has lost her husband and

315
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
give her a better life, is commendable.

316
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:24,250
But, don’t subject her to all your idiosyncrasies
and be more sensitive towards her.

317
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:25,375
Alright.

318
00:26:25,708 --> 00:26:29,750
Son, as long as you don’t subject the girl to pain
or heartache, I am okay with whatever you do.

319
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:31,500
See that?!

320
00:26:31,916 --> 00:26:32,958
Oh dear! What a pair!

321
00:26:51,791 --> 00:26:53,541
Who are you guys?
Whom do you wish to meet?

322
00:26:53,625 --> 00:26:55,708
Doesn’t matter who it is.
We would take them away.

323
00:26:55,833 --> 00:26:58,125
Take them away? Where?

324
00:26:58,458 --> 00:26:59,583
To their funeral.

325
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,750
Goodness! Your words are very twisted.

326
00:27:01,958 --> 00:27:03,333
Are you my master’s son’s friend?

327
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:05,583
I am the daughter-in-law’s boyfriend.

328
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,583
Daughter-in-law’s boyfriend?

329
00:27:07,958 --> 00:27:09,208
Well, stay put.
I will go and inform.

330
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:10,291
Who are you going to inform?

331
00:27:10,416 --> 00:27:11,458
Daughter-in-law of the house.

332
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:13,041
Not necessary. I will take care of that.

333
00:27:13,041 --> 00:27:13,875
You can leave.

334
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,500
A foxy fellow, this one.

335
00:27:16,458 --> 00:27:23,375
Our father in heaven, you said death is just
for the body so that the soul reaches you.

336
00:27:23,666 --> 00:27:30,250
That is why, the responsibility of caring for
our son who is in your divine embrace is yours.

337
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,041
Hush! Hush!

338
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,208
Don’t shout.

339
00:27:34,583 --> 00:27:37,375
If you shout now, your father-in-law along
with others, and I would get into a fight.

340
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:41,375
Is it necessary to get into all this when there is
a prayer meeting going on for Brother Peter?

341
00:27:42,041 --> 00:27:44,125
Come upstairs... for two minutes.

342
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,166
I will speak to you calmly and leave.

343
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:49,333
In the hope that you are a good girl,
and that you wouldn’t scream and

344
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:51,583
expecting that you would be understanding,

345
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:53,458
I am taking my hand off your mouth.

346
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:55,916
Please, dear girl.

347
00:27:56,083 --> 00:27:56,833
Amen!

348
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:57,833
Hey!

349
00:28:00,041 --> 00:28:00,833
What happened, dear?

350
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:01,750
What happened, dear?

351
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:02,791
Nothing.

352
00:28:03,041 --> 00:28:05,500
Looks like the child is in terrible sadness.

353
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:07,041
You guys go ahead.

354
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:12,166
[Prayer]

355
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:28,083
Malli...

356
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,250
Malli...

357
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,541
Hi...

358
00:29:03,958 --> 00:29:05,000
Speak, Malli.

359
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,416
What’s there to speak?!

360
00:29:07,416 --> 00:29:09,416
Do you even realize what’s going on
around here?

361
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,500
A lot of people are crying downstairs.

362
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:12,875
Can’t you see that?

363
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:17,208
I don’t see their tears;
I can only see yours.

364
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:18,916
Are you insane?

365
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:23,458
Do you understand the situation
I was in when you fell for me?

366
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,500
Is that wrong, Malli?

367
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:25,583
Isn’t it?

368
00:29:25,916 --> 00:29:29,625
Would any sensible fellow fall in
love at a house in mourning?

369
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:31,875
Why wouldn’t it be possible?

370
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:35,875
Some one who goes to school every day,
would fall in love with a girl at school.

371
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:39,208
And someone who goes to work every day,
might fall in love with a girl at his workplace.

372
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:43,000
If not at funerals, where would someone
like me, who goes to funerals every day,

373
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:44,708
fall in love, Malli?

374
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:48,375
Well, how was I to know that the girl who
was crying at the funeral was a dead man’s wife?

375
00:29:48,916 --> 00:29:50,166
As soon as I saw you, I fell for you.

376
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,541
Fell for me? I am already married.

377
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:55,041
I am someone’s wife.

378
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,333
As soon as you got to know that information,
you should have left me alone. Isn’t it?

379
00:29:57,958 --> 00:29:59,458
Oh, my silly Malli!

380
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:03,291
If your neighbor accidentally receives
the letter that has your address,

381
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,250
the postman rectifies that mistake
by delivering it the proper address.

382
00:30:08,416 --> 00:30:10,208
That is exactly what happened in
our case too.

383
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,875
The special someone that god designed for
me was mistakenly given to Brother Peter.

384
00:30:16,166 --> 00:30:20,583
After realizing his mistake, god took away
Brother Peter and brought me into the picture.

385
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:21,208
That’s all.

386
00:30:21,416 --> 00:30:22,541
Don’t over analyze it.

387
00:30:23,041 --> 00:30:27,916
If you ever set foot in this part of the town,
I will bury you right next to my husband’s grave.

388
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:32,875
Instead of a place beside your husband’s grave,
why don’t you make place for me in your heart?

389
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:36,625
Brother Peter and I will sit in one corner
of your heart and together love you.

390
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:40,458
It was my mistake to come up here thinking
that I could talk some sense into you!

391
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:44,083
Girl!

392

Thanks, dear.

Mother-in-law, here have it.

446
00:34:59,250 --> 00:34:59,833
Namaste, miss.

447
00:35:00,041 --> 00:35:01,625
Who are you?

448
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,416
Namaste, sir.

449
00:35:02,625 --> 00:35:03,041
Namaste.

450
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:04,791
I work for Life India Insurance, sir.

451
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,416
Peter’s house...?

452
00:35:06,458 --> 00:35:07,166
This is Peter’s house.

453
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,833
There is an insurance policy on
his name worth 25 lakhs.

454
00:35:10,125 --> 00:35:14,375
The nominees for that amount are
Sekhar Samuel and Mary.

455
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:19,083
I am Sekhar Samuel and
this is my wife Mary.

456
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,083
Why would he make us the beneficiaries
for the policy?

457
00:35:22,583 --> 00:35:24,833
When did he purchase the policy?

458
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:26,500
It says 2015.

459
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,208
2015? That was before his wedding.

460
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:32,750
Sir, is it possible to transfer this to
our daughter-in-law’s name?

461
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,208
Sorry, sir.

462
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,166
The company rules do not allow that.

463
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:37,208
The company has already issued a check.

464
00:35:37,291 --> 00:35:39,208
If you sign these documents,
I will give you the check.

465
00:35:39,208 --> 00:35:40,333
Oh?

466
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:43,833
Here.

467
00:35:45,541 --> 00:35:47,833
Thank you. Thank you so much.

468
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:55,000
Laxman, could you please deposit
this check in the bank tomorrow?

469
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,541
As soon as the amount comes into my account,
transfer the money to Mallika’s account.

470
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:02,875
Hey, is it necessary to transfer to Mallika?

471
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:04,583
Your son died.

472
00:36:04,958 --> 00:36:08,125
You don’t know if your daughter-in-law
will stay with us or remarry and leave.

473
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:09,291
Give it a second thought.

474
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,125
What’s there to think about?

475
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:15,500
If she finds someone who can take really
good care of her, I will get her married.

476
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,250
Then, what about the 25 lakhs?

477
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:20,375
I would consider it as a gift I would
give my daughter upon her marriage.

478
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:21,708
Play.

479
00:36:23,083 --> 00:36:24,916

480
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:34,958
Balraju!

481
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:36,458
Balraju!

482
00:36:37,291 --> 00:36:38,125
Balraju!

483
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:40,041
What is it?

484
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,083
Mom wants your blood.

485
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,000
Grandpa asked me to fetch you.

486
00:36:44,666 --> 00:36:46,458
Why should I give your mother my blood?

487
00:36:46,666 --> 00:36:47,583
Tell her that I won’t.

488
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,041
If you refuse...

489
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,291
Grandpa asked me to give this to you.

490
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:55,250
Alright, give it to me.

491
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:56,125
No.

492
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:58,208
He told me to give it to you after you get there.

493
00:36:59,666 --> 00:37:00,875
Very smart!

494
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:02,958
Alright, go!

495
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:15,375
Where did your father go?
-He went out of town.

496
00:37:15,708 --> 00:37:17,333
Grandpa, do you want to have a drink?

497
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:18,250
Yes, of course!

498
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,875
Yeah, right! Do you think it’s free?!

499
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:22,750
You need to give your blood to earn this.

500
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:23,750
Sir... sir...

501
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:26,208
This is a non-smoking and non-drinking area.

502
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:27,250
You mustn’t drink here.

503
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,708
We put out a sign that says so.

504
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,208
What is the use you placed the board that
says no drinking over there while I am drinking here...?

505
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,416
Do one thing.

506
00:37:33,708 --> 00:37:34,166
Sir...

507
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:36,708
Until I finish drinking, turn the board in the other direction.

508
00:37:37,041 --> 00:37:37,958
No, sir.

509
00:37:38,208 --> 00:37:39,500
It’s almost time before sister arrives.

510
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,291
If she sees this, I will be fired.

511
00:37:41,541 --> 00:37:42,583
Not to worry.

512
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,083
I will find a good burial ground for you
and give you a job as a watchman there.

513
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:46,750
Sir! Please, don’t.

514
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,250
It’s almost time before sister arrives.

515
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,291
Please try and understand.

516
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:51,666
You keep harping on this sister!
Who is she?

517
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:52,958
Tell her to come.
We will talk it out.

518
00:37:53,083 --> 00:37:54,916
Sir, she is here.

519
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,666
Cousin!
-Sir...!

520
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:06,750
You kept going on and on about the sister.
Is she the one?

521
00:38:07,041 --> 00:38:09,333
Yes, sir.
Do you know her, sir?

522
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,041
Know her? We are quite close.

523
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:12,875
Is that so?

524
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,375
Do this.

525
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,166
Hold this phone and
feed your number into it.

526
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:19,458
Hey!

527
00:38:20,291 --> 00:38:21,125
Aren’t you ashamed of yourself?

528
00:38:22,083 --> 00:38:24,083
Do you think this is a hospital or a bar?

529
00:38:24,458 --> 00:38:26,000
You are sitting here and consuming alcohol.

530
00:38:26,166 --> 00:38:27,375
Don’t you have any common sense?

531
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:32,333
You give people here medicines
but if I have some alcohol, it’s a crime, huh?

532
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,833
Don’t you ever talk sense?

533
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,333
Please marry me, Malli.
I’ll talk sense.

534
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:42,541
Not just me. No girl in this world will marry you.

535
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,250
You are an idiot of the first order!

536
00:38:45,083 --> 00:38:47,375
They say women usually like idiots.

537
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:51,291
If I am an idiot of the first order,
there cannot be a better option than me.

538
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:53,541
Marry me, Malli.

539
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:54,625
I will kill you.

540
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:55,458
Step aside!

541
00:38:59,666 --> 00:39:00,666
What are you looking at?!

542
00:39:01,791 --> 00:39:02,375
You...

543
00:39:02,958 --> 00:39:03,833
Malli...

544
00:39:05,416 --> 00:39:06,708
Malli... Malli... Malli... Wait!

545
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:09,208
You are a nurse at this hospital, right?

546
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:11,166
You found yourself a good job.

547
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:17,375
It’s such a wonderful feeling when the girl that
you love is a sister to everyone except you.

548
00:39:19,833 --> 00:39:22,083
If you are thrashed plenty and lie here
receiving treatment at the hospital...

549
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:23,708
I will be you sister too!

550
00:39:24,916 --> 00:39:29,916
Even if I am dying, rather than coming here,
I will seek out another hospital.

551
00:39:31,416 --> 00:39:32,375
Mad fellow!

552
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:37,083
Don’t be so cute while scolding me, darling!

553
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:51,666
What the hell are you doing here?!

554
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:54,166
You come here, dear.

555
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:57,375
Are you going to threaten me again?

556
00:39:58,125 --> 00:40:00,750
I lost my son and so was grieving.

557
00:40:01,416 --> 00:40:03,041
If not, I would have killed you a long time ago.

558
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:06,875
It’s ‘cause you are grieving your son’s death,
that you cannot understand my love.

559
00:40:07,416 --> 00:40:09,250
If not, you would have understood it a long while back.

560
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:12,208
Just because we are quiet,
you keep saying all sorts of nonsense.

561
00:40:12,375 --> 00:40:14,541
Didn’t you learn your lesson when
we thrashed your cousin the other day?

562
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:16,166
We should have caught you.

563
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:17,875
Well, I am here, right now.
Hit me, then.

564
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,166
Sir, you hit me the other day.
And yet I came here.

565
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:23,875
You hit my cousin the other day.
And yet, I came here.

566
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,791
Even if you hit me now, I will still come here.

567
00:40:26,333 --> 00:40:27,625
Give me a solution to resolve this.

568
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:30,875
Or else you just keep threatening
that you would kill me.

569
00:40:31,166 --> 00:40:33,375
This looks like a two-bit crook threatening a thug.

570
00:40:33,666 --> 00:40:36,500
I drive a funeral van, sir.

571
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:38,625
Every day, I keep transporting dead bodies.

572
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:40,208
Worse, I will end up a dead body in my own van.

573
00:40:40,208 --> 00:40:40,875
That’s all.

574
00:40:42,083 --> 00:40:43,166
One minute.

575
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,458
Here...

576
00:40:49,125 --> 00:40:52,500
I wondered how I would look if I died and so,
made Satti take a picture of me that way...

577
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:53,541
...in my own van.

578
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:59,625
So, stop these stupid tricks and try something new.

579
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,916
So, you want to show off a bit in front of her, huh?

580
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:03,458
You don’t know what I’m capable of!

581
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:07,333
The picture you saw on my phone was just make-believe.

582
00:41:07,791 --> 00:41:10,625
If you don’t back down,
you would really end up as a dead person.

583
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:29,375
Gangi, seems that the song was played for you.

584
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:31,666
Where are you headed this early in the morning,
making yourself all pretty?

585
00:41:31,958 --> 00:41:33,541
I have some work at the market.

586
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:35,708
Is that so? Come, I shall drop you.

587
00:41:36,125 --> 00:41:37,916
Not necessary. I will walk.

588
00:41:38,333 --> 00:41:40,083
No. How will you walk all the way that far?

589
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,083
Come, I shall drop you.

590
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:44,791
Why are you bringing your lunch box?

591
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:46,416
Are you going to start your shift in the afternoon?

592
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,750
Of course, yes... If not,
how will we be able to survive?

593
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:51,541
Do you even know how
much your father’s medicines cost?

594
00:41:52,625 --> 00:41:54,500
Don’t focus entirely on that girl.

595
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:57,041
At times, pay attention to your father too

596
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,916
Aren’t you there to look after him?

597
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,916
Yeah, right!

598
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:03,250
If I am going to be doing everything,
what are you going to do?

599
00:42:03,583 --> 00:42:05,000
Are you roaming around that Satti..?

600
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,333
Nonsense! Why would I do that?
He showers only once a month.

601
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:09,750
Stop the vehicle there.

602
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,250
Why stop here?
Isn’t the market up ahead?

603
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,625
I have some other work here.
Stop here.

604
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:22,291
You go on ahead.

605
00:42:22,666 --> 00:42:24,583
Alright, be careful and come home soon.

606
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:35,500
Hello?

607
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,875
Your vehicle repair was done!

608
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,125
Is that so?
I am on my way.

609
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:15,833
I saw my mother being close with someone.

610
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,541
Hey, what are you saying?

611
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,125
He must be an acquaintance.

612
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,208
No... I don’t think so.

613
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:24,583
He doesn’t seem that sort.

614
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:27,375
She got up early, got ready and took lunch boxes.

615
00:43:29,958 --> 00:43:31,250
Why would that be necessary, tell me?

616
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:34,375
I am certain that there’s something
between the two.

617
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:38,250
Buddy, I hope you aren’t talking
about that Mohan from TV shop.

618
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:41,375
Well...it’s cause...

619
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,166
even I saw your mother with him...
four to five times.

620
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:45,791
I heard some rumours about it as well.

621
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,375
Hello... Srinu.
-Hello.

622
00:44:22,875 --> 00:44:23,875
You... Idiot.

623
00:44:31,291 --> 00:44:32,583
Why are you hitting me?

624
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:33,833
Who the hell are you?

625
00:44:33,833 --> 00:44:36,375
You don’t know me and
yet you desire my mother?!

626
00:44:36,916 --> 00:44:38,208
You want my mother, huh?

627
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,375
You are Ganga’s son?

628
00:44:45,375 --> 00:44:46,541
I like Ganga.

629
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:48,375
Does that justify you hitting me?

630
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:51,291
How dare you tell me that
you like my mother?!

631
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:03,541
Bro... bro.. no.

632
00:45:03,833 --> 00:45:05,291
No... He is going to die!

633
00:45:05,375 --> 00:45:06,875
If he dies, let him.

634
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,416
How dare he desires my mother?!

635
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:11,041
Come here!

636
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,791
I am asking you to come...

637
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:16,833
Next time, if you look at my mother
or talk to her or tell her that I hit you...

638
00:45:17,041 --> 00:45:20,166
I am going to abduct you and
set you on fire while you are still alive!

639
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:21,041
Understand?

640
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:22,791
Let’s go!

641
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:34,208
What really went wrong that you are in this mood?

642
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:35,666
Come, let’s get a drink.

643
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:38,041
I am sad.

644
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:39,000
I know it.

645
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:41,125
That’s why.
Let’s go and get a drink.

646
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,083
No, buddy.

647
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,875
I am feeling a little empty inside.

648
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:52,083
It’s a weird feeling.

649
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,291
When you feel that way, you must have a drink.

650
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:55,625
Come, let’s go!

651
00:45:55,791 --> 00:45:59,416
You! Constantly with getting drunk!
Alcoholic!

652
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08,791
I drank, happy?.

653
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,583
If you drink it all, what will I drink.

654
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,625
My piss!

655
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:15,291
Shut up and listen to me.

656
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:21,916
I am unable to sleep in the night.

657
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:25,333
I am not able to focus on my work.

658
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:28,583
My life isn’t peaceful.

659
00:46:29,750 --> 00:46:34,166
As much as I try to get closer to Mallika,
her hatred for me grows.

660
00:46:36,416 --> 00:46:39,833
When I look at my mother, I see her abandoning my father and me,
and enjoying her time with some other man.

661
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:43,833
I don’t know what to do.

662
00:46:44,041 --> 00:46:45,541
Everyone has problems.

663
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:48,791
But, I don’t have any solution
other than this to offer.

664
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:02,250
Even with her situation,
Mallika continues to remain chaste.

665
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:07,416
Even when I keep following her around,
she doesn’t encourage me one bit.

666
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:08,625
That’s true.

667
00:47:09,041 --> 00:47:11,041
She doesn’t even treat you as kindly
she would a dog!

668
00:47:11,416 --> 00:47:13,458
Never mind that! Continue.

669
00:47:16,916 --> 00:47:21,083
It’s been so long since her husband died
and she still continue to mourn for him.

670
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:24,208
Isn’t it rare for someone of this generation to be like her?

671
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:28,916
Why go that far? Just look at my mother.

672
00:47:29,125 --> 00:47:31,208
Why bring aunt into this?

673
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:32,458
But, it’s true. Isn’t it?

674
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:36,208
Looking at them in that lens...

675
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,458
Mallika is still a better person than my mother.

676
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:41,250
Hey...

677
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,791
I feel like seeing Mallika.

678
00:47:45,208 --> 00:47:47,708
Please don’t say that you would go to her house.

679
00:48:12,916 --> 00:48:14,208
Malli...

680
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:16,958
Malli...

681
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:20,666
Peter? Have you come?

682
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,333
I knew that you would come to see me.

683
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:27,666
It’s because it’s dark, everything looks blurry.

684
00:48:28,458 --> 00:48:29,958
I can’t see.

685
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:33,333
Where is my glasses..?

686
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,208
How are you, my dear boy?

687
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,166
I am good, granny.

688
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:44,083
I came to pay you a visit since
you are sad and miss me a lot.

689
00:48:44,541 --> 00:48:49,041
Ever since you died,
I don’t feel like having even a drop of water.

690
00:48:51,041 --> 00:48:52,666
Don’t lie to me, granny.

691
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:56,458
When they made the offering of the food for the dead,
Weren’t you the one who had the most amount of food there?

692
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:58,625
How do you know that?

693
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:01,000
I watch everything from the heaven.

694
00:49:01,166 --> 00:49:02,416
Forget all that.

695
00:49:02,416 --> 00:49:05,125
How will I be able to live
without you around, Peter?

696
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:07,000
If that’s the case, then come with me.
You can leave the world behind.

697
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,541
Oh no! Let’s do it next time.

698
00:49:08,541 --> 00:49:09,916
Not this time.

699
00:49:10,291 --> 00:49:11,500
Then, why get anxious?

700
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,916
Alright, I will go and talk to my wife and return.

701
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,333
Please, come back dear.

702
00:49:16,708 --> 00:49:19,166
Why don’t you meet your father
once before you leave?

703
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:24,958
Sekhar! Peter is here!

704
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:27,750
Goodness! This old woman made
a mess of things.

705
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,041
Peter..?

706
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:32,916
Who is it?

707
00:49:42,291 --> 00:49:42,875
Peter...

708
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:44,291
Hey, Malli...

709
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:46,250
why are you crying?

710
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:48,791
Is it because you lost the photo?

711
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:52,458
Of what use is a photo when
the person in the photo died?

712
00:49:59,125 --> 00:49:59,833
You stay, dear.

713
00:50:00,666 --> 00:50:01,458
You! Get lost!

714
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:05,291
You Idiot!

715
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,291
How dare you slip into my house in the middle of the night?!

716
00:50:08,291 --> 00:50:09,750
Don’t just let him go.

717
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:10,750
Call the police.

718
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:12,250
Do you think I couldn’t do that before?

719
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:15,458
If we lodge a complaint,
our daughter-in-law will be the one who will be mocked at.

720
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,625
It doesn’t matter if I am mocked at.

721
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:20,666
Just call the police.

722
00:50:23,458 --> 00:50:25,125
Say it! Say it!
Would you dare go into their house again?!

723
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:27,041
Sir, please intervene.

724
00:50:29,875 --> 00:50:35,458
Sir... Sir,
Why are you hitting my son?

725
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,041
Tell them to stop.

726
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:41,250
Sir, please tell them.
Please have some mercy.

727
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,916
Hello,
Sir, tell me.

728
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:50,833
Uh...alright, sir.
I will take care of it.

729
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,458
What is it, sir? What do you want us to do?

730
00:50:57,291 --> 00:51:00,583
My boss called me.
He wanted me to let that person go.

731
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:04,875
And here you are, asking me to file an FIR.
His mother there keeps begging us not to hit her son.

732
00:51:06,458 --> 00:51:10,791
This won’t work.
Why don’t you guys talk it out and settle this?

733
00:51:10,833 --> 00:51:12,083
What do you say?
It's better..

734
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:16,291
Sir...Sir...
My son isn’t that kind of a person.

735
00:51:16,708 --> 00:51:18,791
He did that because he was intoxicated.

736
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:22,250
Things like this don’t happen...
I’ll make sure that this doesn’t repeat, Sir.

737
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,666
Sir, please. Please let him go.

738
00:51:25,083 --> 00:51:26,291
Let him go, you ask?!

739
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,625
It’s ‘cause you didn’t discipline him enough
that he turned out this way.

740
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:31,458
Sir... it’s my fault.

741
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,916
Should we just let it go when some intoxicated man
comes into our house in the middle of the night?

742
00:51:36,875 --> 00:51:39,791
Tomorrow, if perchance no one is around and he takes
advantage of our daughter-in-law, what do we do then?!

743
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,583
He isn’t the kind to do such a sort of a thing.

744
00:51:42,375 --> 00:51:43,250
Yeah, right!

745
00:51:44,083 --> 00:51:46,750
You are the one to vouch for him!
Nonsense!

746
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,375
If you allow it, I’ll have one final word with him, sir.
Bring him.

747
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:55,208
Hey, 402
-Sir

748
00:51:55,208 --> 00:51:56,041
bring him here.

749
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:07,250
Sit down.

750
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,291
I don’t think I can sit down.
If you want, you can stand.

751
00:52:12,458 --> 00:52:14,375
Hey! Arrogant prick!

752
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:17,250
Useless fellow!

753
00:52:26,958 --> 00:52:31,416
Look at what you are doing to a girl in mourning.
Huh?

754
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,708
Your mother is worried and begs that we let you go.

755
00:52:37,083 --> 00:52:39,125
Isn’t Mallika my daughter-in-law?
Wouldn’t it pain to me to see her subjected to such pain?

756
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:43,791
All I said was not to bother her.

757
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,416
Take pity. She is in a lot of pain.

758
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:49,750
Aren’t you ashamed to harass her that way?

759
00:52:51,041 --> 00:52:51,958
No, sir. I am not.

760
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:57,208
Apart from hunger, sleep and stubbornness,

761
00:52:57,208 --> 00:53:03,041
don’t you have it in you to be kind, have a bit of mercy or being humane?
Is your conscience acquainted with these qualities?

762
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:03,916
No, sir. I do not.

763
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,125
I heard that you worked as a headmaster in a school.

764
00:53:07,958 --> 00:53:11,916
I don’t think you understood life as much as you understood books.

765
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,291
What does that mean?

766
00:53:17,041 --> 00:53:19,125
You think you know more about life than I do?

767
00:53:20,375 --> 00:53:23,333
Tell me. Come on, tell me about life.
Tell me in a way that I can understand.

768
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:25,583
Even if I tell you, you wouldn’t understand.

769
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:28,375
Stop talking that way. Show some respect to the elder.

770
00:53:28,833 --> 00:53:30,791
Isn’t it wrong to get drunk and go into their house?

771
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,875
Get lost!
As if you have the moral compass to talk about what’s right or wrong!

772
00:53:33,250 --> 00:53:34,583
You are not qualified to talk of about morals!

773
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:38,708
What happened, son?
-Aunt, hold on. Don't talk.

774
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:41,583
Nephew, what is it? Why is he talking like that?
-I told you, don't say any thing.

775
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:42,875
Sir,
-Tell me

776
00:53:42,875 --> 00:53:44,208
we don’t want to get involved in this mess.

777
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:47,458
All that we need is for him to stop bothering our daughter-in-law.
Yes.

778
00:53:50,666 --> 00:53:55,083
Like the elder suggested, if you write a letter
promising not to bother Mallika ever again...

779
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:58,416
...I will let you go.
If not...

780
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:29,166
Where are you going?
-To meet Mallika.

781
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:48,541
Where is Mallika?
-She is ward number three.

782
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:55,916
Everything okay?

783
00:55:03,125 --> 00:55:04,250
The police beat me black and blue.

784
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:08,333
They even had me sign a letter stating that
I would never bother you again.

785
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:12,708
Why did you come here again?

786
00:55:15,041 --> 00:55:16,125
I cannot be without you.

787
00:55:17,375 --> 00:55:20,708
How long are you going to mourn him?
Is he going to come back to life if you keep crying for him?

788
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:37,416
The life that we all live, is nothing but a beautiful lie.

789
00:55:38,208 --> 00:55:42,416
The death that took your husband way, is the unbelievable truth.

790
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:48,708
Since we cannot accept the truth, we end up living a life of lies.

791
00:55:51,125 --> 00:55:53,375
Do you know how many deaths I witnessed?

792
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:57,833
If someone dies, people mourn for him for a day or two;
or at the maximum, a week.

793
00:55:58,625 --> 00:56:00,375
By the 12th day, things settle down and get back to normal.

794
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,541
It’s been so long and you still continue to mourn for him?!

795
00:56:08,291 --> 00:56:10,625
It’s my husband; I am the one mourning and it’s my business.

796
00:56:11,708 --> 00:56:13,250
I’ve been observing for quite some time -

797
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:16,625
you stop me wherever possible, spew some nonsense or the other,

798
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,916
get drunk and walk into our house!

799
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,458
Is this a joke to you?!

800
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:22,916
Do you really think this is love?

801
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:25,125
If this is not love, what else could it be, Malli?

802
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,083
Disgusting! Shut up!

803
00:56:27,125 --> 00:56:30,583
There is no decency nor courtesy.
What was it that you said earlier?!

804
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,375
“When someone dies, things get back to normal within a week”?

805
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:34,291
Yes.

806
00:56:34,666 --> 00:56:36,250
How will things be normal?

807
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:42,583
When a mother sees her dead son...
does that look normal to you?

808
00:56:44,708 --> 00:56:49,041
When a father, who lovingly raised his son,
heads the funeral procession for his son...

809
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,708
...does that look normal to you?

810
00:56:53,291 --> 00:56:56,666
When a girl who leaves her parents and her home behind for her husband,

811
00:56:57,208 --> 00:57:02,416
and dreams and wishes for a future with her husband...
...is left alone when he dies...

812
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:04,416
does that look normal to you?

813
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:08,875
Yes, it is normal.

814
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:13,291
Everyone goes through such things, Malli.

815
00:57:14,083 --> 00:57:16,250
But does that mean you would stay this way for the rest of your life?

816
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:17,625
That’s none of your business.

817
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:24,166
I may or may not remain this way for the rest of my life.
I may find someone or not.

818
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:28,125
But you are not welcome in my life.

819
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,333
Why? What did I do that’s so wrong?

820
00:57:31,333 --> 00:57:35,166
Setting aside the love you have for your husband,
tell me one reason why I am not eligible to be with you.

821
00:57:35,375 --> 00:57:42,333
Ever since the day I saw you and up until now,
everything that you did is a reason enough for me to reject you.

822
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:46,208
I don’t know if you understand this or not, Balraju.

823
00:57:47,166 --> 00:57:48,125
This is a maternity ward.

824
00:57:48,833 --> 00:57:51,916
I’ve been working as a maternity nurse in this ward for four years now.

825
00:57:53,041 --> 00:57:54,916
Every day, I see a birth.

826
00:57:55,958 --> 00:58:02,250
When there is a birth, everyone around the baby
is very happy and have grand dreams for it.

827
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:03,625
I understand all that.

828
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:08,833
But, you... you attend funerals every day!

829
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:10,750
You don’t understand the value of life.

830
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:14,166
You don’t understand the pain behind the tears.

831
00:58:16,041 --> 00:58:18,875
You constantly deal with dead bodies and don’t even respect death.

832
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:22,708
And I don’t think you value birth and life either.

833
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:28,291
It’s impossible for you to understand the life of
love that lies between birth and death!

834
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:38,250
All these days, I was under the impression
that getting you to like me was the challenge.

835
00:58:38,958 --> 00:58:40,625
But strangely you are the one
who gave me the solution to the challenge.

836
00:58:42,041 --> 00:58:44,708
All this while I was thinking that
this was a love story between you and me.

837
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:49,291
This is the love story between birth and death.

838
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
We are just temporary characters.

839
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:58,333
I figured it all out, Malli.
-What did you figure?

840
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:02,458
You are a maternity nurse who deals with birth
and I deal with death and funerals.

841
00:59:02,666 --> 00:59:06,583
Even lord Brahma cannot find a better match than us.

842
00:59:07,083 --> 00:59:09,916
The children you help birth will one day grow up
and one day or another find their way to me after death.

843
00:59:10,416 --> 00:59:12,000
And you will come to me.

844
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:14,916
Yes, I will. When I die, I will come to you as a corpse.

845
00:59:15,166 --> 00:59:16,916
You can then happily bury me.

846
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:17,625
Did you listen to yourself?

847
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:20,250
You admitted that you yourself would come to me.

848
00:59:20,791 --> 00:59:24,166
When you die, why would you want me
to be the one to transport you?

849
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:25,541
Why can’t you use someone else’s vehicle?

850
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:28,500
That can only mean that you want to come to me.

851
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:31,958
See that...that is how much you love me and my vehicle!

852
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:32,875
Love?

853
00:59:33,625 --> 00:59:37,000
In my opinion, there is no difference between you
and the graves in the graveyard.

854
00:59:38,291 --> 00:59:39,708
You must be imagining things.

855
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:43,208
Birth and death are two entirely separate worlds.

856
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,041
They can never meet.

857
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,500
Remember that!

858
00:59:46,875 --> 00:59:47,500
Goodbye.

859
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:11,750
Murali?

860
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:13,458
Did Raju come by?

861
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,291
He hasn’t been home since yesterday.

862
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:17,166
Yes, sir. He came here yesterday.

863
01:00:17,625 --> 01:00:19,916
Sister Mallika gave him an earful
and sent him on his way.

864
01:00:20,166 --> 01:00:22,125
I don’t know where he went after that.

865
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:24,958
But, Raju felt really bothered.

866
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:27,666
When the police beat him black and blue
at the station, he wasn’t that bothered.

867
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,875
Was he really that bothered after
Mallika gave him an earful?

868
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:31,333
Absolutely not possible.

869
01:00:31,916 --> 01:00:33,000
Where could he have gone?

870
01:00:42,916 --> 01:00:44,958
Brother, why did your wife scold
me so much?

871
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:47,791
She said ‘good boy’ before she left.

872
01:00:48,458 --> 01:00:51,041
If I really was such a good boy,
why would she not love me?

873
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,291
She keeps scolding me and praising me!

874
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,500
She does what she wants.

875
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:58,125
How did you tolerate her?

876
01:00:59,375 --> 01:01:01,333
You must have died because you
couldn’t tolerate her any longer.

877
01:01:02,583 --> 01:01:03,916
But I am not like you, brother.

878
01:01:04,458 --> 01:01:05,458
I have a lot of patience.

879
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:06,500
I will tolerate her.

880
01:01:09,208 --> 01:01:12,500
The problem here is that she
doesn’t have clarity.

881
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:16,166
She says I am no different from
the graves in this graveyard.

882
01:01:17,083 --> 01:01:18,750
Doesn’t that mean you and
I are the same?

883
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:23,666
She kept hugging you and crying.
With me, she cries and tells me off.

884
01:01:25,958 --> 01:01:29,208
Well, anyways, it’s good to see
that she cries for the both of us.

885
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:33,916
But... I didn’t like this one thing
about her.

886
01:01:33,958 --> 01:01:35,000
I don’t care if you mind.

887
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,708
How could she say that I don’t
respect death?

888
01:01:39,458 --> 01:01:40,416
How wrong she is!

889
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:45,000
What does all my experience count for?

890
01:01:45,333 --> 01:01:47,791
I helped the funerals of great
many people and great people.

891
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:49,416
How can she say that?

892
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:53,916
Well, she is young.
So, this time, I’ll let it slide.

893
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,416
[sniffles]

894
01:01:55,625 --> 01:01:58,125
Well, I am glad to have your blessings.

895
01:01:58,333 --> 01:01:59,125
That is enough.

896
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:02,083
Okay, I shall take my leave.

897
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,708
What?! It’s your birthday tomorrow?

898
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:17,666
Why didn’t you bring it up?

899
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:19,375
You stay right here.

900
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,208
I will bring my friends and
the party to you.

901
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:22,541
We shall have fun.

902
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:26,000
Raju! Raju!

903
01:02:27,625 --> 01:02:28,541
Come fast, buddy.

904
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:31,708
Our friends are all waiting for us.

905
01:02:32,250 --> 01:02:33,333
Uncle, what’s up? What’s new?

906
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:35,833
Well, I am sure you have nothing
new to say.

907
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,166
So, I’ll fill you in.
Listen

908
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:38,875
Do you know what your son was up to?

909
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:41,083
A while ago, he went to a funeral
and fell in love with the dead man’s wife

910
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:42,500
and proposed to her.

911
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:43,750
It’s true.

912
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,708
As soon as the people around her heard
that, they beat him up nicely.

913
01:02:48,041 --> 01:02:49,041
Are you asking me how?

914
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:51,833
Well, remember the way we chase and thrash
a rabid dog when it walks into our street...

915
01:02:52,083 --> 01:02:53,708
...your son was beaten up in the same manner
and was thrown into the jail at the police station.

916
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:56,083
Even then, our fellow did not concede.

917
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:57,791
He took his funeral van out...

918
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:03,208
...and drove it around as if it was a golden
chariot...and followed that girl around.

919
01:03:03,583 --> 01:03:07,750
Finally, that girl was disgusted with
him and begged him not to follow her,

920
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,625
gave him an earful, chewed
his ego and spit it out!

921
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:12,833
Even then, he has no iota of shame.

922
01:03:13,041 --> 01:03:14,125
Well, why would he have any shame at all?

923
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,666
He is your son after all, isn’t he?

924
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:17,875
Cousin...

925
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,041
What are complaining about to my father?

926
01:03:19,583 --> 01:03:20,583
Nothing, cousin.

927
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:23,416
I am narrating the struggle that
Mallika is going through...

928
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:26,166
... to gain her independence from you,
in a manner that makes your father proud.

929
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:27,250
Enough with that nonsense!

930
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,500

I wish you a very happy birthday.

1005
01:08:39,083 --> 01:08:40,375
Yours, Balaraju.

1006
01:08:57,541 --> 01:08:59,875
Son, where have you been all night
without coming home?

1007
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:05,333
What is he doing here?

1008
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:07,625
Hey! What is your business here?

1009
01:09:09,041 --> 01:09:09,791
TV Repair...

1010
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,708
Hey! The TV needs repair.
That’s why I called him here.

1011
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:15,916
Why? Are you going to die if you
don’t watch TV?

1012
01:09:16,666 --> 01:09:18,500
What about you? Haven’t you had
a good beating the other day?

1013
01:09:18,708 --> 01:09:19,625
And yet you came to our house?

1014
01:09:20,208 --> 01:09:21,916
I will...get.... the picture tube...

1015
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,791
You! Did you hit him?

1016
01:09:25,166 --> 01:09:26,875
I am asking you. Did you hit him?

1017
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:27,958
Yes, I hit him.

1018
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:29,041
So what?!

1019
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:30,875
Does that make you angry?

1020
01:09:31,291 --> 01:09:32,208
Are you going to fly off in rage?

1021
01:09:32,791 --> 01:09:35,375
Even I am unable to take the cheap
behavior you indulge in with him.

1022
01:09:37,208 --> 01:09:38,416
Like you haven’t ruined our reputation
all over town...

1023
01:09:38,625 --> 01:09:39,875
...and now, you got him directly here!

1024
01:09:40,416 --> 01:09:42,291
Hey! Don’t talk rubbish.

1025
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,375
I am going to say my piece.

1026
01:09:43,583 --> 01:09:47,250
Not just me.
Everyone in the street talks about this.

1027
01:09:49,666 --> 01:09:52,375
As my mother, I loved you a lot.

1028
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,333
But now... when I look at you,
I am disgusted.

1029
01:09:59,125 --> 01:09:59,958
I don’t like it.

1030
01:10:00,875 --> 01:10:01,791
What don’t you like?

1031
01:10:02,625 --> 01:10:03,750
I don’t like your adulterous behavior.

1032
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:05,916
When I keep remembering how
immoral you are...

1033
01:10:06,916 --> 01:10:07,875
... I cannot sleep.

1034
01:10:08,083 --> 01:10:08,833
Do you understand that?

1035
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:16,208
How dare you hit me when
you are in the wrong? You!

1036
01:10:18,958 --> 01:10:20,333
No! No! Hit me instead.

1037
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,666
Oh god! His love for you is annoying me.

1038
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:24,583
I cannot watch this!

1039
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,291
If I ever see you again,
I will certainly kill you.

1040
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:29,750
Mohana, please leave.

1041
01:10:30,291 --> 01:10:30,958
Uh...no.

1042
01:10:31,166 --> 01:10:31,875
I asked you to leave!

1043
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:34,791
Please, don’t scold her.

1044
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,875
Shut it! Get lost!

1045
01:10:39,875 --> 01:10:41,166
You! Come with me!

1046
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:41,958
Let go!

1047
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:43,125
I told you to come with me!

1048
01:10:44,875 --> 01:10:45,583
Sit down.

1049
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:50,208
Here. Drink it

1050
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:55,916
Tell me.

1051
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:58,541
So, you suspect that there is something
going on between us, right?

1052
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:01,666
I don’t suspect. I know for sure.

1053
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:07,041
Every morning you pack a lunch box for him...
give him the left over corn kernels...

1054
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:08,750
...I see everything.

1055
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,458
What do you think you saw?

1056
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:17,000
Just because I pack him lunch and give him corn cobs,
does that mean we are having an affair?!

1057
01:11:18,291 --> 01:11:22,541
If a man and women looking friendly,
the only conclusion is that they are having an affair?

1058
01:11:24,916 --> 01:11:28,166
It's true that Mohana likes me...

1059
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:30,208
I respect him too.

1060
01:11:31,125 --> 01:11:31,958
Do you know why?

1061
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:40,000
He asked me to marry him and said that he
would treat me and my family as his own.

1062
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:46,875
But, when I refused,
he never brought it up ever again.

1063
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:50,333
He just remained a good friend.

1064
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:56,708
You've been struggling to confess your love to a woman.

1065
01:11:57,166 --> 01:12:00,583
And you think you can talk to me about improper behaviour?!

1066
01:12:02,625 --> 01:12:07,291
In order to win a girl's heart...
...you must first try and  understand her.

1067
01:12:08,666 --> 01:12:12,833
If you want to understand Mohana,
you must first understand Mallika.

1068
01:13:03,416 --> 01:13:06,375
Are you deeply hurt because of what
I said in the morning?

1069
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:11,416
When a mother hits her child,
her heart is surely in pain.

1070
01:13:13,583 --> 01:13:15,500
Well, is there anything new about
what you said?

1071
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:20,416
Every day when I wake up and
go to the market,

1072
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,166
I hear someone or another pass
such comments.

1073
01:13:24,083 --> 01:13:27,791
It’s very easy to judge and talk smack
about others.

1074
01:13:28,625 --> 01:13:34,250
But...the sting those words carry will
only be known to those who face them.

1075
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:40,125
At times, I want to run away from all this.

1076
01:13:45,375 --> 01:13:47,000
That is why...I have this.

1077
01:13:48,166 --> 01:13:50,875
Mom... please don’t take it to heart.

1078
01:13:52,458 --> 01:13:53,958
Here, pour me a drink.

1079
01:13:56,208 --> 01:14:00,125
When a mother hits a child,
the child’s heart aches as well.

1080
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,291
Pour me a drink.

1081
01:14:13,041 --> 01:14:16,333
Even you like him, right?

1082
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:20,750
When he said that he wanted to
marry you, why didn’t you agree?

1083
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,500
Dad?

1084
01:14:26,041 --> 01:14:29,291
When Mohana asked me to marry him,
your father was the first person I told.

1085
01:14:31,291 --> 01:14:34,583
Even he voiced his approval
to the marriage.

1086
01:14:37,916 --> 01:14:38,833
Well, then. Why didn’t you?

1087
01:14:40,291 --> 01:14:43,958
If I am going to be married once again,
what’s going to happen to the both of you?

1088
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:50,333
On the suspicion that something’s going on between us,

1089
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:52,666
you spoke as if you were disgusted with me.

1090
01:14:56,166 --> 01:15:00,750
If…it was really the case,…

1091
01:15:03,416 --> 01:15:08,291
…you would have treated me with contempt.

1092
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:10,875
Mother, that’s not the case.

1093
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,000
Mohana is a very good guy.

1094
01:15:15,291 --> 01:15:17,000
If I am with him, I will surely be happy.

1095
01:15:17,625 --> 01:15:21,583
But, if that happiness means that you and
your father would both grow distant from me,

1096
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:25,916
that happiness would bring me
the greatest sadness as well.

1097
01:15:28,708 --> 01:15:31,416
Your father has no one else besides us.

1098
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:34,416
I want you both.

1099
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:37,250
I cannot be without you both.

1100
01:15:38,041 --> 01:15:39,250
Where will we go leaving you?

1101
01:15:43,083 --> 01:15:46,750
Well, if all of us... were to stay together...

1102
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,875
will you marry him?

1103
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,250
Son!

1104
01:15:53,625 --> 01:15:55,000
What are you talking?

1105
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:58,125
Yes, mother.

1106
01:15:59,083 --> 01:16:02,375
I was in the wrong regarding this.

1107
01:16:04,833 --> 01:16:06,916
I think you marrying him would
be the right thing to do.

1108
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:13,958
Alright, don’t think too much about this.

1109
01:16:14,166 --> 01:16:15,666
I will go and talk with him in the morning.

1110
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:16,833
Son, that’s not it....

1111
01:16:18,291 --> 01:16:20,708
Don’t think about it and just go to sleep.

1112
01:16:33,083 --> 01:16:34,625
Enough if she is taken good care

1113
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Babu Mohana, you seem to be on a high.

1114
01:16:51,083 --> 01:16:53,375
Oh goodness! I don’t drink.

1115
01:16:53,791 --> 01:16:56,791
What? As a teetotaler, how could
you have fallen for my aunt?

1116
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,375
If my aunt opens a bottle of liquor, she will
chug the whole thing, down to the very last drop.

1117
01:16:59,583 --> 01:17:00,291
Did you know that?

1118
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:01,583
Yes, I do.

1119
01:17:01,791 --> 01:17:04,208
At times, I was worried she might
swallow the bottle as well.

1120
01:17:04,458 --> 01:17:05,166
Hey!

1121
01:17:05,375 --> 01:17:06,416
Let’s cut to the chase.

1122
01:17:07,583 --> 01:17:09,250
You said that you wanted to
get married to my mother.

1123
01:17:10,333 --> 01:17:12,208
Is that true or were you just bluffing?

1124
01:17:12,791 --> 01:17:14,125
Oh no! I swear on mother.

1125
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:16,458
Oh god! Are you swearing an oath
on my mother or yours?

1126
01:17:18,458 --> 01:17:20,208
How childish!

1127
01:17:20,791 --> 01:17:24,416
Why would you bring your mother,
father and god into this?!

1128
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:25,625
Sorry.

1129
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:31,541
Trust isn’t something that comes
through oaths or prayers.

1130
01:17:32,166 --> 01:17:33,208
It should be organic.

1131
01:17:34,958 --> 01:17:35,916
The other day even though I beat
the shit out of you,

1132
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:37,791
you still confessed that you
like my mother.

1133
01:17:38,083 --> 01:17:39,666
That...that is a quality in a good man.

1134
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:42,541
I like you.

1135
01:17:44,416 --> 01:17:48,583
Well... I will give my mother to you.
Will you marry her?

1136
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:49,833
What?

1137
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:57,958
Son...

1138
01:17:58,166 --> 01:17:59,000
He looks like he might die out
of happiness.

1139
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:01,666
Enough with all this.

1140
01:18:02,291 --> 01:18:05,416
If anything goes wrong, you do know
how I behave, don’t you?

1141
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:06,416
No, son. Nothing will go wrong.

1142
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:09,458
I will take very good care of you,
Gangi and even your father.

1143
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:12,125
Oh my! Gangi, is it?!

1144
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:16,833
We will deal with our lives on our own.

1145
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,541
But my mom should be happy.

1146
01:18:21,958 --> 01:18:25,166
Mohana, stop listening to
these drab songs.

1147
01:18:25,416 --> 01:18:26,583
If you go mad, it would be another
mess altogether.

1148
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,041
Don’t worry.

1149
01:18:43,375 --> 01:18:44,583
I didn’t come here to fight.

1150
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:46,333
I came here to invite you to a wedding.

1151
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:49,333
Are you getting married? For real?

1152
01:18:50,666 --> 01:18:51,666
Malli..Bal..

1153
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:56,125
Malli...
Apparently, Balraju is getting married.

1154
01:18:57,708 --> 01:18:58,750
You have nothing to worry anymore.

1155
01:18:59,708 --> 01:19:01,583
That’s very good news. Very pleased.

1156
01:19:02,083 --> 01:19:03,083
Very good. God bless you.

1157
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:07,041
I made it sound like I was getting
married just to see you this happy.

1158
01:19:07,291 --> 01:19:08,416
I am not the one getting married.

1159
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:10,458
It’s my mother.

1160
01:19:10,916 --> 01:19:12,625
What?! Your mom is getting married?

1161
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:13,625
Yes, Malli

1162
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:16,791
My mom fell in love with a young
man called Mohana.

1163
01:19:16,958 --> 01:19:17,750
Young man?!

1164
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:20,333
How long has it been since your
father passed away?

1165
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:21,791
No, uncle. He isn’t dead.

1166
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:22,750
He is still alive.

1167
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,625
But he is bedridden and isn’t
of any use.

1168
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,541
You mean, they are divorced?

1169
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,250
Looks like she doesn’t get
the whole picture.

1170
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:32,458
Oh no, aunty. They are still together.

1171
01:19:32,708 --> 01:19:34,916
Anyway, what’s the point of them
getting a divorce at their age?

1172
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:45,500
How can you get your mother married
when your father is still alive?

1173
01:19:47,666 --> 01:19:49,500
I don’t think you would understand
even if I explained it to you.

1174
01:19:49,750 --> 01:19:50,625
Holy god!

1175
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:51,833
What a pity!

1176
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:54,916
What kind of family is this?

1177
01:19:55,583 --> 01:19:57,500
You are in love with a widow.

1178
01:19:58,041 --> 01:20:00,291
And your mother goes around with someone
else, even though your father is still alive.

1179
01:20:00,666 --> 01:20:03,666
And now, you are getting them married
and you are giving her away.

1180
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:05,541
Very good! Nice!

1181
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:11,166
What I don’t understand is, why are the moral
standards in the society plummeting this steeply?

1182
01:20:11,458 --> 01:20:12,625
It’s our house and our business.

1183
01:20:12,958 --> 01:20:14,125
We do as we please.

1184
01:20:15,458 --> 01:20:16,958
Well, these are such good tidings and
we wanted to invite you to the wedding

1185
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:18,416
But here you are judging us!

1186
01:20:19,083 --> 01:20:19,833
Give it, cousin.

1187
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:22,958
Here.

1188
01:20:23,791 --> 01:20:25,125
The food is free.

1189
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:26,958
If you wish, you can come and
give them your blessings.

1190
01:20:27,708 --> 01:20:29,416
Even if you don’t come, it isn’t
such a great loss either!

1191
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:35,458
Malli... you must come for sure.

1192
01:20:36,041 --> 01:20:37,291
It’s a wedding in your future home.

1193
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:39,875
Bye, aunty.

1194
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:23,833
Dear parrot, did you drink until
your belly is full?

1195
01:21:24,208 --> 01:21:28,541
Dear parrot, did you drink until
your belly is full?

1196
01:21:29,041 --> 01:21:33,833
Your drunken son is here put
some food in his belly.

1197
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:34,916
Mother!

1198
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:35,708
Disgusting! Stop that!

1199
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:37,333
You would wake all the neighbors
with this drunken tune!

1200
01:21:37,541 --> 01:21:38,958
There is food in the kitchen.

1201
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:40,666
Go and help yourself, drunken idiot!

1202
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:42,416
Oh goodness!
As if you don’t surpass me in this.

1203
01:21:42,625 --> 01:21:43,958
And you call me a drunkard, huh?

1204
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:52,791
[humming a tune]

1205
01:21:54,208 --> 01:21:54,958
What’s up, father?

1206
01:21:55,166 --> 01:21:56,291
What are you looking at?

1207
01:21:56,500 --> 01:21:57,375
Haven’t you gone to sleep yet?

1208
01:21:57,666 --> 01:21:58,625
This guy...!

1209
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:16,375
Father, did you eat?

1210
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:18,875
Did your wife give you your medicine?

1211
01:22:19,791 --> 01:22:20,500
Oh god!

1212
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:22,916
Even though you are bedridden,
you still live like a king.

1213
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:25,916
The god really gifted you with a wife
who takes such good care of you.

1214
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:32,250
Please, forgive me father.

1215
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:34,166
I ruined you.

1216
01:22:34,791 --> 01:22:38,208
I am giving away your adoring wife
to someone else in marriage.

1217
01:22:39,083 --> 01:22:40,291
Well, what’s the point of just
making a noise?

1218
01:22:40,625 --> 01:22:43,458
You are bedridden and I am just
whiling away my life.

1219
01:22:43,916 --> 01:22:45,791
She should have someone to
take care of her, right?

1220
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:48,416
Father...

1221
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,500
...apparently even your wife
likes Mohana.

1222
01:22:52,583 --> 01:22:53,750
She told you about it, right?

1223
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:56,583
Then, what’s the delay?
Why make that noise?

1224
01:22:58,291 --> 01:23:02,250
Apparently, your wife wanted to
sacrifice their love for our sakes.

1225
01:23:03,833 --> 01:23:06,500
Is she the only one who knows to
sacrifice? Don’t you think we know too?

1226
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:11,333
That is why I decided to give
your wife away to him.

1227
01:23:12,291 --> 01:23:17,333
Since you cannot speak,
I spoke on your behalf.

1228
01:23:23,708 --> 01:23:26,416
Well, go to sleep. Even I am sleepy.

1229
01:23:37,291 --> 01:23:38,333
Malli?

1230
01:23:42,458 --> 01:23:44,625
What’s up, Malli?
Are you waiting for the bus?

1231
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:47,625
No, I am waiting for an airplane.

1232
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,083
Really? If that was the case, my vehicle
takes people to a place way beyond

1233
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,583
where the airplane flies.

1234
01:23:51,583 --> 01:23:53,333
Do you want to come? I will drop you.

1235
01:23:54,333 --> 01:23:55,875
Why are you torturing me?

1236
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,208
Torture?

1237
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:00,916
Well, stay put. I will be back.

1238
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:18,666
Does this seem like torture to you?

1239
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:24,458
If you spoke to me properly, why would
I feel the need to follow you around?

1240
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:29,250
When a person you love is in pain, is it
wrong to want to check up on them frequently?

1241
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:32,250
Why would you mistake that
as me harassing you?

1242
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:37,500
In all honesty, the reason why you are
at least in such a state of mind is all due to me.

1243
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:40,416
In fact, you should be the one
to thank me.

1244
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:43,416
Really? You think so, huh?

1245
01:24:43,791 --> 01:24:44,500
Of course!

1246
01:24:44,708 --> 01:24:47,666
Brother Peter’s death caused you
this much pain.

1247
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:50,583
And the pain I caused by loving
you is this much.

1248
01:24:51,041 --> 01:24:53,333
Compare these two.
Doesn’t it look small?

1249
01:24:53,708 --> 01:24:54,958
In fact, it’s completely eclipsed.

1250
01:24:56,041 --> 01:24:58,041
That is why you should be thanking me.

1251
01:25:00,708 --> 01:25:02,875
Anyways, I hope you are coming to
my mother’s wedding.

1252
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,541
No. I won’t.

1253
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:09,166
Malli, please come.
My mother would be happy.

1254
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:10,875
She keeps asking about you.

1255
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:12,208
Is that so?

1256
01:25:13,458 --> 01:25:15,916
If she really gives me so much thought,
why doesn’t she give enough thought

1257
01:25:16,083 --> 01:25:17,791
to your father’s feelings?

1258
01:25:18,458 --> 01:25:20,333
Why is she getting married when
her husband is still alive?

1259
01:25:20,666 --> 01:25:23,500
What do you mean, Malli?
Why are you talking like others would?

1260
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:27,833
No one in this world takes care of
my father as much as my mother does.

1261
01:25:28,416 --> 01:25:32,291
Her entire life was spent catering
to his needs.

1262
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:37,541
What can he do? Such is the fate
of being sick.

1263
01:25:37,916 --> 01:25:40,125
Does that mean she has to
continue living such kind of life?

1264
01:25:40,291 --> 01:25:41,708
Doesn’t she get a second chance
at happiness?

1265
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:46,291
That is why me and my father are
getting my mother married to Mohana.

1266
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:50,416
If a 25 year old is chasing after a girl,
his intentions are open to interpretation.

1267
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:54,875
But, if a 50 year old man says that
he wants a family and he wants a married life,...

1268
01:25:55,083 --> 01:25:56,833
...should I fault his intentions, Malli?

1269
01:25:58,875 --> 01:26:02,500
Malli, it would be good if our
past remains in our memories.

1270
01:26:03,291 --> 01:26:07,291
But if we consider those memories to
be life, we wouldn’t move forward.

1271
01:26:10,208 --> 01:26:12,166
I don’t want my mother to stay stuck.

1272
01:26:22,791 --> 01:26:24,916
My bus is here. I am leaving.

1273
01:26:28,041 --> 01:26:28,791
Malli !

1274
01:26:30,125 --> 01:26:32,250
I don’t like you being stuck in
your pain either.

1275
01:26:48,791 --> 01:26:51,208
Someone who goes to school everyday,
might fall in love with a girl at school.

1276
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:53,916
If not at a funeral, where would
someone like me, who attends funerals

1277
01:26:54,083 --> 01:26:56,666
every day, fall in love with a girl?

1278
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:02,166
Malli, the life that we keep living,
is a beautiful lie.

1279
01:27:02,833 --> 01:27:06,708
The death that has claimed your
husband’s life, is the unbelievable truth.

1280
01:27:09,541 --> 01:27:11,416
Everyone goes through these things.

1281
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,041
Does that mean you should
not move on in life?

1282
01:27:17,083 --> 01:27:19,083
I don’t like my mom being stuck
there.

1283
01:27:28,416 --> 01:27:28,958
Tell me, sir.

1284
01:27:29,125 --> 01:27:29,958
What would you like me to show you?

1285
01:27:31,083 --> 01:27:33,791
You can put on the Doordarshan channel
and show us a superhero program.

1286
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:35,916
What can you show us?!

1287
01:27:36,291 --> 01:27:37,625
Heard you are popular for your
wedding wear.

1288
01:27:37,833 --> 01:27:38,625
Show us that.

1289
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:41,291
Sonu, show them the stock that
we received yesterday.

1290
01:27:42,333 --> 01:27:44,916
Please have it, sir.

1291
01:27:52,625 --> 01:27:57,000
Well, what about you?
What’s going on with you and Mallika?

1292
01:27:58,125 --> 01:28:00,833
I don’t know, Mohana.
I am unable to understand that girl.

1293
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:02,916
If you really can’t understand her,
why don’t you let her go?

1294
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:09,291
I am getting my mother married to you.

1295
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:11,000
And here you are, giving me
such shitty advice.

1296
01:28:11,208 --> 01:28:12,000
That’s not it...

1297
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:14,083
I meant...sometimes letting go
will make things work.

1298
01:28:14,291 --> 01:28:15,416
Oh really?

1299
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,791
Is this how you made my mother
fall for you?

1300
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:20,250
I was kidding.

1301
01:28:28,166 --> 01:28:30,291
What’s going on?
Why has she been staring at you?

1302
01:28:49,416 --> 01:28:50,541
You were looking at me, right?

1303
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:51,833
No.

1304
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:53,041
I know that you were looking at me.

1305
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:54,000
Let’s go.

1306
01:28:54,208 --> 01:28:54,791
Where?!

1307
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:55,791
Come on, come. I’ll tell you later.

1308
01:28:58,416 --> 01:28:59,833
Mom! Come here

1309
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:05,083
Guess who it is.

1310
01:29:05,791 --> 01:29:06,541
Mallika!

1311
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:10,750
Oh goodness! How did you guess?

1312
01:29:11,208 --> 01:29:12,958
Who else would you be this
comfortable with?

1313
01:29:13,291 --> 01:29:14,625
You think I wouldn’t be able
to guess that much?

1314
01:29:16,583 --> 01:29:18,375
Are you well, dear?
-Fine

1315
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:21,458
Mallika, this is Mohana;
My step-father.

1316
01:29:24,541 --> 01:29:26,125
Is my son troubling you?

1317
01:29:26,791 --> 01:29:28,083
Yes, aunt. He is troubling me a lot.

1318
01:29:28,750 --> 01:29:30,541
Mother! Mother!

1319
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,125
Aunt, don’t hit him.

1320
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:35,208
To tell you the truth, even though
he’s been troubling me,

1321
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:40,875
the anger I felt towards him helped
me overcome my grief.

1322
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:44,083
How is that possible, Balraju?

1323
01:29:44,916 --> 01:29:48,125
To fall in love with me and my past?

1324
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:49,750
And you even love my husband
from my past?

1325
01:29:51,666 --> 01:29:52,625
I don’t know, dear.

1326
01:29:52,833 --> 01:29:54,625
Things just worked out that way
between the both of us.

1327
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:58,458
Hey!

1328
01:29:58,791 --> 01:30:00,708
You said that you would be satisfied
if I am polite with you.

1329
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:04,291
From now on, do not bring up topics
of love or marriage between us.

1330
01:30:04,583 --> 01:30:05,833
We can stay friends.

1331
01:30:06,458 --> 01:30:07,416
Oh goodness!

1332
01:30:07,625 --> 01:30:09,250
If you want, you can be friends with me.

1333
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:11,666
Did I ask for your permission to
fall in love with you?

1334
01:30:12,375 --> 01:30:15,000
You be friends with me and I will
happily continue to be in love with you.

1335
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:16,791
We can deal with other things later.

1336
01:30:17,708 --> 01:30:19,125
There is nothing further ahead for us.

1337
01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:20,458
I am giving you a heads up.

1338
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:23,708
Alright, Malli. As you wish.

1339
01:30:25,541 --> 01:30:26,500
Well, in that case, friends?

1340
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:28,333
Okay...friends.

1341
01:30:32,750 --> 01:30:33,458
Bye, aunty.

1342
01:30:34,166 --> 01:30:34,833
Bye uncle.

1343
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:39,041
Why would you agree to be just
friends with her?

1344
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:41,000
My dear silly Mohana.

1345
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:42,958
Today’s children are tomorrow’s citizens.

1346
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:45,791
In the same manner, today’s friends
are tomorrow’s lovers.

1347
01:30:47,166 --> 01:30:48,750
What about you? How could you
hit me in front of that girl?

1348
01:30:48,958 --> 01:30:49,750
Have you no shame?!

1349
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,833
Oh god! Why would you hit me again?

1350
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,541
Mallika is going back all alone.

1351
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:54,750
Go and drop her.

1352
01:30:55,125 --> 01:30:56,083
My mother is indeed awesome.

1353
01:30:58,625 --> 01:31:00,291
Malli, come. I will drop you.

1354
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:03,416
Go about your business.

1355
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,375
Why would you say that?

1356
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:07,416
Am I not your friend?

1357
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,791
Does that mean I am not your friend?

1358
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:13,250
Well...for now...let’s say we are friends.

1359
01:31:14,166 --> 01:31:14,875
What?

1360
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:16,541
Come, I’ll drop you.

1361
01:31:20,833 --> 01:31:28,500
♪Heart moved like the boat
towards the sky♪

1362
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:36,083
♪It is making a mess to need you♪

1363

Balraju...

1387
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:33,041
Will you come to the hospital at 10 o’ clock in the morning?

1388
01:36:34,083 --> 01:36:35,291
I need to speak to you.

1389
01:36:57,416 --> 01:36:59,166
Dear, are you returning from the hospital?

1390
01:36:59,291 --> 01:37:00,000
Yes, father-in-law.

1391
01:37:00,791 --> 01:37:02,208
Come and have dinner, dear.

1392
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:03,708
Did you eat?

1393
01:37:03,958 --> 01:37:06,375
Yes, I did. A little while ago.

1394
01:37:08,791 --> 01:37:09,458
Mix it up.

1395
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:17,750
Malli...

1396
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:22,208
your mother-in-law and
I searched a groom for you.

1397
01:37:24,625 --> 01:37:27,500
They said that they would like to meet you.
When would you like them to come?

1398
01:37:28,708 --> 01:37:30,041
Marriage...to me?

1399
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:31,291
That is...

1400
01:37:33,291 --> 01:37:37,333
You might not want to get married
but we have the responsibility to get you married.

1401
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:42,958
How long will you stay alone, dear?

1402
01:37:45,708 --> 01:37:52,666
Everyone including the pall bearer in the
streets thinks a widow is an easy target.

1403
01:37:53,333 --> 01:37:53,833
Damn it!

1404
01:37:55,791 --> 01:37:57,875
If I think like Peter’s father...

1405
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:04,583
I have no right to question your choices such as the place you want to live,
or whether you want to get married or not...

1406
01:38:05,291 --> 01:38:10,541
or even if you are interested in
getting married to someone like Balraju.

1407
01:38:11,041 --> 01:38:11,666
Isn’t that so?

1408
01:38:12,125 --> 01:38:13,250
It’s your life and your wish.

1409
01:38:15,125 --> 01:38:17,500
But if I think like your father, you are our responsibility.

1410
01:38:19,916 --> 01:38:26,041
We will give a good amount of thought to where
and with whom you would be the happiest.

1411
01:38:27,875 --> 01:38:33,083
We will consider your greatest well-being
when we find a match for you and get you married.

1412
01:38:34,708 --> 01:38:35,333
Eat.

1413
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,166
Father-in-law...

1414
01:38:48,666 --> 01:38:50,541
you mean more to me than my father.

1415
01:38:59,125 --> 01:39:00,583
[singing a peppy tune]

1416
01:39:01,750 --> 01:39:04,041
Come on, decorate it well.
Aunt’s wedding should dazzle.

1417
01:39:04,208 --> 01:39:05,833
What are you going to do?
Come and help on the other side.

1418
01:39:06,416 --> 01:39:08,333
Uncle is in the way.

1419
01:39:08,333 --> 01:39:09,500
Cousin, he says that your father is in the way.

1420
01:39:09,625 --> 01:39:11,916
If he is in the way, set him aside.
-Okay!

1421
01:39:12,125 --> 01:39:13,375
Okay!

1422
01:39:13,500 --> 01:39:15,291
Hold on! Hold on!

1423
01:39:16,291 --> 01:39:19,041
Father, are you worried that we are sidelining you?

1424
01:39:19,416 --> 01:39:20,458
Why make that noise?

1425
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:23,875
Aren’t we doing this with your permission?

1426
01:39:24,125 --> 01:39:25,416
He agreed. Come on lift him up.

1427
01:39:26,166 --> 01:39:27,041
Hey! Hey!

1428
01:39:27,125 --> 01:39:28,916
Not the bed. Just lift uncle up.

1429
01:39:44,708 --> 01:39:48,250
Sir! Sir! Please stop!
Please stop!

1430
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:50,083
Sir...

1431
01:39:50,833 --> 01:39:51,708
What happened?

1432
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,250
There’s been an accident.
We need to take the victim to the hospital.

1433
01:39:54,583 --> 01:39:56,958
Alright. I am heading there anyways.
Come... get him in.

1434
01:39:57,083 --> 01:39:57,708
Alright, young man.

1435
01:40:03,291 --> 01:40:03,958
Hello?

1436
01:40:04,375 --> 01:40:05,416
Cousin?

1437
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,708
Did sister Mallika come?
-I don’t know, sir.

1438
01:40:08,166 --> 01:40:09,833
Why wouldn’t you keep yourself informed?

1439
01:40:11,708 --> 01:40:13,833
Why would they pay you a salary?

1440
01:40:14,125 --> 01:40:15,041
Just find out and call me back.

1441
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:16,208
Alright, sir.

1442
01:40:25,250 --> 01:40:26,833
Hey! Come on hurry and help him.

1443
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:34,666
Is Mallika here?
-One minute, sir.

1444
01:40:37,250 --> 01:40:38,208
Is madam here?

1445
01:40:38,750 --> 01:40:40,875
Step aside! Step aside!
-She isn’t here yet, sir.

1446
01:40:49,625 --> 01:40:50,166
Mom...

1447
01:40:51,375 --> 01:40:52,083
Hey! Step aside!

1448
01:40:54,833 --> 01:40:55,375
Mother!

1449
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:56,875
Mother..??
-Mother!

1450
01:40:57,666 --> 01:40:58,625
What happened to you?

1451
01:41:00,208 --> 01:41:01,791
Mother?
What’s all this?

1452
01:41:02,250 --> 01:41:02,708
Mom...

1453
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:04,833
What do you mean an accident?

1454
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:06,750
Please, get up once.

1455
01:41:07,583 --> 01:41:09,666
Once...just once... get up.
Please talk to me.

1456
01:41:09,916 --> 01:41:11,000
Mom... mom...

1457
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:12,875
I am getting scared.

1458
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:14,333
Please talk to me.

1459
01:41:36,375 --> 01:41:39,083
Balraju, have you been waiting a long time?

1460
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,041
It’s okay, Malli.

1461
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:43,250
You said you wanted to tell me something.

1462
01:41:46,458 --> 01:41:48,666
My father-in-law got a potential groom for me.

1463
01:41:51,291 --> 01:41:53,416
I know you would be saddened to hear this.

1464
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:58,375
I know how much you love me.

1465
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:02,583
Let’s just put an end to this here.

1466
01:42:04,458 --> 01:42:05,250
Please...

1467
01:42:05,833 --> 01:42:07,125
I hope you understand.

1468
01:42:11,708 --> 01:42:13,708
How is my mother, doctor?

1469
01:42:13,916 --> 01:42:15,750
What happened to your mother, Balraju?

1470
01:42:16,416 --> 01:42:17,250
I am sorry.

1471
01:42:17,666 --> 01:42:20,958
She lost a lot of blood due to the
injuries she sustained in the accident.

1472
01:42:22,041 --> 01:42:23,083
She is dead.

1473
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:35,583
Balraju?

1474
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:38,875
They said my mother is dead.

1475
01:42:42,291 --> 01:42:43,166
I am sorry.

1476
01:42:43,875 --> 01:42:46,875
I thought you came here and were waiting for me...

1477
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:50,000
...and I said all that to you.

1478
01:42:51,375 --> 01:42:52,916
I am sorry, Balraju.

1479
01:42:54,416 --> 01:42:55,875
Never mind that, Malli.

1480
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:00,291
My mother died because she couldn’t breathe.

1481
01:43:05,416 --> 01:43:07,833
I can breathe but it feels like I am dead.

1482
01:43:10,541 --> 01:43:11,333
Because...

1483
01:43:13,250 --> 01:43:18,958

What happened?

1500
01:46:41,166 --> 01:46:44,500
When the day breaks,
it’s going to be Mallika’s wedding day.

1501
01:46:46,708 --> 01:46:50,083
She had always maintained her distance with me.

1502
01:46:50,833 --> 01:46:51,625
But...

1503
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:57,500
I always gave her the benefit of
doubt because she doesn’t know any better.

1504
01:46:58,458 --> 01:46:59,125
But...

1505
01:47:00,166 --> 01:47:01,666
But now she’s gotten close to me,

1506
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:07,916
I am finding it difficult to take in the fact
that very soon she’s going to go out of my life.

1507
01:47:08,958 --> 01:47:10,416
The girl you are in love with is getting married.

1508
01:47:11,416 --> 01:47:12,875
It indeed is a huge problem.

1509
01:47:15,833 --> 01:47:23,166
When I fell in love with your mother, I never imagined
that I would convince you and you father for a wedding.

1510
01:47:23,541 --> 01:47:26,041
After you found out about us, the problem grew bigger.

1511
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:28,916
But, wasn’t that solution for the problem within you?

1512
01:47:29,875 --> 01:47:32,708
As soon as you recognized the love
we had for each other, everything changed.

1513
01:47:33,708 --> 01:47:36,000
I suggest you find out what the exact issue is.

1514
01:47:37,666 --> 01:47:43,250
Doesn’t matter how big a problem it is.
The solution to it would always be very small and simple.

1515
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:47,333
A simple solution for a big problem?

1516
01:47:49,041 --> 01:47:50,541
Who told you that, Mohana?

1517
01:47:51,791 --> 01:47:53,166

What is he doing here?

1524
01:48:22,333 --> 01:48:26,750
Laxman, the responsibility of making sure
that things don’t go awry is yours.

1525
01:48:32,041 --> 01:48:33,458
Who allowed you inside?

1526
01:48:40,791 --> 01:48:45,125
There... see that bearded watchman.
He allowed me in here.

1527
01:49:04,375 --> 01:49:06,541
If I really wanted to fight,
I would have come when Mallika was around.

1528
01:49:07,625 --> 01:49:09,041
I came here to talk to him.

1529
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,625
But if you insist there needs to be a fight,

1530
01:49:12,625 --> 01:49:14,750
I will thrash everyone here,
stop the wedding and then leave.

1531
01:49:55,166 --> 01:49:59,708
David, do you agree to be married to Mallika?

1532
01:50:02,458 --> 01:50:03,541
I agree, father.

1533
01:50:05,125 --> 01:50:09,375
Mallika, do you agree to be married to David?

1534
01:50:15,666 --> 01:50:16,750
I agree, father.

1535
01:50:25,166 --> 01:50:29,291
The thing is, last Monday,
Mallika and I met each other for the last time.

1536
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:33,291
She told me that her father-in-law is getting her married and
asked me to never meet her again.

1537
01:50:34,708 --> 01:50:37,333
Unlike my usual reaction,
I decided that I wouldn’t meet her anymore.

1538
01:50:38,250 --> 01:50:40,958
The thing I don’t understand is...

1539
01:50:41,583 --> 01:50:45,625
after Brother Peter’s death, you wanted Mallika to remarry.
You are getting her married.

1540
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:49,125
What is it that stops you from
considering me as a groom to marry her?

1541
01:50:50,583 --> 01:50:52,000
You are the issue.

1542
01:50:54,291 --> 01:50:56,083
When my son died,

1543
01:50:57,791 --> 01:51:03,125
instead of finding her own path, she stayed and cared for us,
way beyond how she would take care of her own parents.

1544
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:09,291
Mallika means more to us now than our son who died.

1545
01:51:10,666 --> 01:51:12,250
How can you imagine us giving her away to you?

1546
01:51:13,791 --> 01:51:17,583
The day Peter died, you said that you love her
and made a fool of her in front of everyone there.

1547
01:51:17,583 --> 01:51:18,958
You even took the matter to the police.

1548
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:24,375
And then, your mother...

1549
01:51:25,708 --> 01:51:26,833
Great mother.

1550
01:51:29,208 --> 01:51:31,541
Christ, forgive me for saying this.

1551
01:51:31,541 --> 01:51:32,625
She is even worse.

1552
01:51:33,875 --> 01:51:36,625
She has a husband and she still has an affair with someone else.

1553
01:51:38,125 --> 01:51:41,333
How can I send my daughter Mallika to your home in marriage?!

1554
01:51:44,666 --> 01:51:48,666
You, your mother and...your sleazy morals.
What is this?!

1555
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:50,750
Disgusting!

1556
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:58,250
When you didn’t respect our mourning,
I thought you have no respect for the dead.

1557
01:51:59,791 --> 01:52:02,708
When you father is still alive at home and
you went ahead to get your mother married,

1558
01:52:02,708 --> 01:52:04,208
I thought it’s because of the way you were raised.

1559
01:52:04,208 --> 01:52:04,833
Okay.

1560
01:52:05,916 --> 01:52:08,166
Lastly, even though there’s been
a death in your family very recently,

1561
01:52:08,208 --> 01:52:12,083
you chose to disrespect mourning
and come here instead to have this discussion with me.

1562
01:52:12,083 --> 01:52:13,541
I don’t really get it!

1563
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:17,166
We beat you up, reprimanded you
and even dragged you to the police station.

1564
01:52:17,166 --> 01:52:17,875
Enough!

1565
01:52:18,541 --> 01:52:19,583
Now, we can’t take it anymore.

1566
01:52:20,708 --> 01:52:23,708
We beg you. Please leave us alone.

1567
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:25,708
Please...

1568
01:52:41,416 --> 01:52:43,166
I came here to speak to you...

1569
01:52:44,958 --> 01:52:46,500
but you are the one that has a lot of to say.

1570
01:52:49,791 --> 01:52:51,875
I don’t even know what to respond to first.

1571
01:52:54,291 --> 01:52:57,666
Alright. I will start with my mother.

1572
01:52:58,500 --> 01:52:59,583
A pity she died.

1573
01:53:00,875 --> 01:53:04,416
She was twelve years old
when she was married off to my father.

1574
01:53:05,458 --> 01:53:07,000
I was born when she turned fourteen.

1575
01:53:08,083 --> 01:53:09,583
My father became bed-ridden when she was fifteen.

1576
01:53:11,375 --> 01:53:17,416
Up until then, my mother tried living a comfortable life
with my father’s income.

1577
01:53:18,625 --> 01:53:23,416
At once... she lost all support and tucked me onto her hip
and took to earning a living for herself and us.

1578
01:53:25,416 --> 01:53:32,208
Only the god above and she know how much
she starved to feed me twice a day.

1579
01:53:34,083 --> 01:53:39,958
Even when she didn’t have a single penny on her,
she never begged or resorted to doing anything wrong.

1580
01:53:41,750 --> 01:53:45,791
After all these years, a great man came along,
understood the situation our family was in,

1581
01:53:45,791 --> 01:53:47,416
understood my mother’s heart and wanted to get married to her.

1582
01:53:48,083 --> 01:53:50,041
Even though she wanted to get married to him...

1583
01:53:51,458 --> 01:53:55,583
she rejected him because
she couldn’t leave me and my father behind.

1584
01:53:57,666 --> 01:53:59,708
That is how great my mother is.

1585
01:54:02,458 --> 01:54:04,791
This mother of mine is making me cry!

1586
01:54:05,875 --> 01:54:09,833
And who are you to talk about her and my upbringing?
What do you know?

1587
01:54:19,083 --> 01:54:22,958
It’s okay for you to take on the role of Mallika’s father
and get her remarried after your son’s death

1588
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:30,916
But you judge that I am wrong to take on the voice of
my bedridden and sick father, and get my mother remarried.

1589
01:54:33,625 --> 01:54:35,625
Are you...are you saying that what’s
right for Mallika isn’t right for my mother?

1590
01:54:38,708 --> 01:54:39,583
I don’t know, sir.

1591
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:42,125
You be the judge.

1592
01:54:48,750 --> 01:54:52,958
If I say something, you would call me uncouth and disrespectful
and someone who doesn’t understand the value of things.

1593
01:54:55,166 --> 01:54:57,833
Even if I explained to you,
the value I place on things, you wouldn’t understand.

1594
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:03,666
That’s ‘cause you can know life only until your death.

1595
01:55:06,083 --> 01:55:08,458
But, I started at death.

1596
01:55:19,708 --> 01:55:20,750
Are you scared?

1597
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:22,000
Yes, uncle.

1598
01:55:23,416 --> 01:55:28,791
These people think that death is a huge deal.

1599
01:55:29,291 --> 01:55:31,833
But it is a very small thing.

1600
01:55:32,041 --> 01:55:34,958
Just as birth, death is the same too.

1601
01:55:37,750 --> 01:55:44,208
A child in a mother’s womb thinks that the world is only as big
as the womb and there is nothing beyond it.

1602
01:55:44,458 --> 01:55:47,208
But when it’s born,

1603
01:55:47,208 --> 01:55:51,541
it is shocked to see such a huge
world in front of it and so, begins to cry.

1604
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:54,166
Death is just the same.

1605
01:55:54,250 --> 01:55:57,291
It is as good as leaving the womb
of the earth and reaching another plane.

1606
01:55:57,291 --> 01:56:02,041
When a person dies, we are under the impression
that it is the end and there is nothing more to it.

1607
01:56:02,041 --> 01:56:03,916
Well, who knows?

1608
01:56:05,083 --> 01:56:07,791
Maybe there is a happier life for the dead elsewhere.

1609
01:56:08,083 --> 01:56:10,416
And maybe all those who die are headed there.

1610
01:56:10,416 --> 01:56:15,250
That is why there is no need to cry for the dead nor to fear death.

1611
01:56:17,083 --> 01:56:18,875
How will it work if you are scared of such things?

1612
01:56:19,250 --> 01:56:20,916
Here, help me. I need to fix the pall.

1613
01:56:24,250 --> 01:56:25,958
As my uncle Sreenu said...

1614
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:29,250
I don’t know if there is another world beyond death.

1615
01:56:30,791 --> 01:56:32,208
Only the dead know it.

1616
01:56:33,875 --> 01:56:35,291
But there is one thing I know.

1617
01:56:37,458 --> 01:56:42,000
We don’t know when death comes.
But, when it does, it comes in a flash and steals life.

1618
01:56:43,416 --> 01:56:46,000
What matters is how happy we are before that happens.

1619
01:56:47,875 --> 01:56:51,583
If someone wants to really be happy,
there is no better heaven than earth

1620
01:56:52,458 --> 01:56:55,541
and for the one who wants to be sad,
there is no greater hell than this earth.

1621
01:56:56,625 --> 01:56:58,125
Both of them are right here.

1622
01:57:00,125 --> 01:57:04,208
The reason why I am telling you
this is because Mallika likes me too;

1623
01:57:05,041 --> 01:57:07,666
because Mallika would be very happy with me.

1624
01:57:09,500 --> 01:57:10,791
Mallika likes you?

1625
01:57:11,666 --> 01:57:13,166
If she likes you, she would tell us.

1626
01:57:14,916 --> 01:57:17,958
Alright, sir. Let’s assume that Mallika doesn’t like me.

1627
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:21,250
I was the one in love with Mallika.

1628
01:57:21,583 --> 01:57:23,458
I was the one who followed her around and proposed marriage.

1629
01:57:24,083 --> 01:57:26,708
And like you said, I am the one who robbed her of peace of mind.

1630
01:57:28,375 --> 01:57:33,041
If I was the one who did all this,
shouldn’t I be the one to let go of her first?

1631
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:35,875
Why did Mallika come up to me and tell me –

1632
01:57:36,083 --> 01:57:42,583
Balraju, I know how much you like me.
But let’s just put an end to all that now.

1633
01:57:43,708 --> 01:57:45,916
Why would she think that she has to put an end to all this?

1634
01:57:47,875 --> 01:57:49,583
That can only mean that she likes me too.

1635
01:57:51,458 --> 01:57:56,666
But that foolish girl is getting married
to someone else just to please you.

1636
01:58:04,166 --> 01:58:07,000
Even if I cry, my mother wouldn’t return to life.

1637
01:58:09,208 --> 01:58:11,500
I will take care of your daughter-in-law
as I would my dead mother.

1638
01:58:14,541 --> 01:58:18,916
In this entire world,
the ones who love Mallika the most are the two of us.

1639
01:58:20,208 --> 01:58:21,750
That is why I think you would understand.

1640
01:58:24,833 --> 01:58:26,291
The rest is up to you, sir.

1641
01:58:27,958 --> 01:58:31,791
If you think Mallika is your responsibility,
give her hand in marriage to whoever pleases you.

1642
01:58:32,166 --> 01:58:32,916
I will not question your decision.

1643
01:58:34,375 --> 01:58:39,041
But, if you really consider Mallika to be your daughter,
and if her happiness is what matters the most,

1644
01:58:39,708 --> 01:58:40,666
give her to me.

1645
01:58:41,625 --> 01:58:43,000
I will care for her more than you do.

1646
02:00:01,916 --> 02:00:04,125
Fella, how much is a corn kernel?
-Ten rupees.

1647
02:00:06,416 --> 02:00:07,416
I will not sell it to you.

1648
02:00:10,125 --> 02:00:13,750
Give it a thought. I will give you what you want.

1649
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:17,083
No matter how much you pay me, I will not sell it to you.
If you need to, go and buy it at the next vendor.

1650
02:00:20,125 --> 02:00:21,208
