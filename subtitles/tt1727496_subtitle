1
00:02:56,356 --> 00:02:58,950
Look, Sunanda, I have toId
you my entire case.

2
00:02:59,793 --> 00:03:01,556
Now try to see that
the divorce takes..

3
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:02,890
..pIace as soon as possibIe.

4
00:03:03,897 --> 00:03:06,365
I don't know.
PIease. At Ieast try.

5
00:03:07,701 --> 00:03:09,601
ActuaIIy your case is very cIear.

6
00:03:10,337 --> 00:03:12,601
Both want to take divorce
by mutuaI consent.

7
00:03:12,906 --> 00:03:15,306
So don't worry.
It is onIy a question of 6 months.

8
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,710
But I can understand
your feeIings.

9
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:20,272
Because personaIIy..

10
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:22,247
..I have aIso gone through
this period, Naren.

11
00:03:23,183 --> 00:03:26,152
Look, Naren, I want to
give you some advice.

12
00:03:26,553 --> 00:03:31,923
UntiI your divorce isn't done
with, don't stay aIone.

13
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:34,685
Because IoneIiness
wiII swaIIow you.

14
00:03:35,762 --> 00:03:43,726
And if if you ever feeI IoneIy,
then I'm there for you.

15
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:55,907
Can I Ieave?
-Take care of yourseIf.

16
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:57,173
Thank you.

17
00:03:58,752 --> 00:04:01,778
Tired gait,
rumpIed hair, in a daze..

18
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:06,157
Naren Ahuja made a smaII mistake
in his Iife. Marriage.

19
00:04:06,693 --> 00:04:08,684
This bank manager's TV reporter..

20
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:10,730
..wife was busy in breaking news.

21
00:04:10,897 --> 00:04:13,195
And here,
their marriage was breaking up.

22
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,630
And then the pIace of their
Iove and Iove Ietters..

23
00:04:15,702 --> 00:04:17,363
..was taken up by siIence
and Ietters.

24
00:04:17,437 --> 00:04:18,267
In the same house..

25
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:20,602
..both of them were near, but
stiII far away from each other.

26
00:04:21,374 --> 00:04:25,174
SIowIy, the taste Ieft the chewing
gum of their marriage.

27
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:28,276
And now neither can you vomit
it out nor swaIIow it.

28
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:31,649
Even the Iove for their daughter
couId not save this marriage.

29
00:04:31,718 --> 00:04:32,707
The promises of Iove..

30
00:04:32,786 --> 00:04:34,447
..of being together for
seven Iifetimes were..

31
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:36,546
..converted into arguments and
fights in onIy 7 years.

32
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:38,686
And then Naren Ieft his
house in which..

33
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:40,419
..he stayed with his
wife and chiId.

34
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,229
And then both decided to get
divorced at an auspicious moment.

35
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:48,893
Anyway uItimateIy..

36
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:53,435
..Naren has at Ieast come to stay
at his deceased parents' house.

37
00:04:54,207 --> 00:04:58,303
But he does not know how to fiII
the emptiness in his Iife.

38
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:39,441
Beware. This person who is boring
God, MiIind KeIkar..

39
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:42,386
..is himseIf a very boring man.
-He was in London for 4 years.

40
00:05:42,455 --> 00:05:44,150
Brought back with him
the nation's bondage.

41
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:47,455
In his part time, he writes the
remixes of GuIzar to GhaIib.

42
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:48,516
And in his fuII time..

43
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:50,790
..he gets peopIe married
in Jhatpat Shaadi.com.

44
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:52,892
But the poor feIIow is
himseIf a bacheIor.

45
00:05:53,466 --> 00:06:00,235
His poetry has a Iot of pain,
but is a head ache for others.

46
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,373
MiIind. PrincipIed.

47
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:05,543
You are not ready for marriage.

48
00:06:05,745 --> 00:06:07,872
So take back your registration
cheque.

49
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:09,411
No, no, no. I can't keep this.

50
00:06:09,482 --> 00:06:11,643
No, no, no. It is against the
poIicy. -Are you sure?

51
00:06:11,718 --> 00:06:13,879
Yes. -Thank you so much.

52
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:19,186
Don't worry, come back after 5
years. -Wow. Mr. MiIind KeIkar.

53
00:06:20,126 --> 00:06:22,219
So you aIso give free advice
to your cIients?

54
00:06:22,295 --> 00:06:26,595
Yes, sir. I'm trying to give
genuine advice to the cIients.

55
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,897
Don't do it.
Just do your work. -Okay.

56
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,570
We are running Jhatpat
Shaadi.com here.

57
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:35,764
We have not taken the onus of
imparting free advice to peopIe.

58
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,510
First teII me,
have you got married yet or not?

59
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:41,603
No. -Then how can you
speak about marriage?

60
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:42,705
What is so difficuIt about that,
sir?

61
00:06:42,782 --> 00:06:44,443
Before this,
I worked in a sari store.

62
00:06:44,651 --> 00:06:46,710
Does that mean that I was
wearing a sari? -Shut up.

63
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,387
You know,
onIy three things run in India.

64
00:06:52,459 --> 00:06:54,757
Yes, I know. Car, train and pIane.

65
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:59,527
No. FiIms, cricket and marriages.

66
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:05,229
Mr. KeIkar, make marriages happen.
Marriages. Understood?

67
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:06,397
Understood.

68
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,575
This is Abhay Suri.

69
00:07:20,687 --> 00:07:22,814
In EngIish,
these peopIe are caIIed pIayboys..

70
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:24,220
..in Hindi 'ChaIu' (Cunning).

71
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,588
And girIs caII them
smart and handsome.

72
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:29,259
At sunset, Iike the birds
go into their nests..

73
00:07:29,329 --> 00:07:31,729
..these peopIe are found
in pubs and discos.

74
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:35,258
Abhay, aIias Abby, is abIe
to take someone..

75
00:07:35,335 --> 00:07:37,360
..or the other in his arms,
with his boyish charm.

76
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:40,365
And then girIs aIso bear
their entire expenses.

77
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:44,202
TruIy ATM.
Any Time 'Mohabbat' (Love).

78
00:07:44,277 --> 00:07:46,302
But don't be under the impression
that he does not work.

79
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:47,676
He is a trainer at a gym.

80
00:07:47,747 --> 00:07:50,181
And he never takes his eyes
of his cIients' bodies.

81
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,615
Gives them proper attention.

82
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:54,780
In short, his Iife has the
three 'F' fundamentaIs.

83
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:59,282
Fun, fIirting and the third 'F',
you must have understood.

84
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:02,221
This is his Iife's
onIy achievement.

85
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:11,800
I wiII be back in a minute.

86
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,707
Every day,
there is some probIem with him.

87
00:08:14,774 --> 00:08:16,435
Hey, what is it?
What's going on here?

88
00:08:16,843 --> 00:08:18,242
Where is the girI? -GirI?

89
00:08:18,611 --> 00:08:19,839
Which girI? From where?

90
00:08:20,313 --> 00:08:21,439
What happened, baby?

91
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:24,378
Hey, did you peopIe see?

92
00:08:24,818 --> 00:08:26,217
It is a daiIy occurrence.

93
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,786
This won't do in a
rented apartment.

94
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,584
Shut up. Why are you shouting?
-Hey, I'm the MLA of this area.

95
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:32,522
And aIso the secretary
of the buiIding.

96
00:08:32,592 --> 00:08:34,150
I wiII get you imprisoned.

97
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,688
Hey, sir, I had voted for you.
Come, come and sit down.

98
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:39,163
I have not come here to sit.
-Where is she? Throw her out.

99
00:08:39,232 --> 00:08:40,699
Sir, you are under the
wrong impression.

100
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,429
You know what? I'm a gym
instructor. I was teaching yoga.

101
00:08:43,503 --> 00:08:45,266
Teaching yoga at 2:00
in the morning?

102
00:08:45,338 --> 00:08:47,272
Hot yoga.
It can take pIace at night, too.

103
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,102
It can take pIace anytime. 24/7.

104
00:08:48,174 --> 00:08:50,199
PIease Ieave it. He is a good boy.

105
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,105
A good boy. How do you know that?
-He teaches me, too. Hot yoga.

106
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,740
What?
From today, your yoga is over.

107
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,818
And your residence in the
society is over, too.

108
00:08:58,885 --> 00:09:01,319
You wiII have to vacate the fIat
within 2 days. -Come on sir..

109
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:04,322
..I've eIected you for 5 years and
you are throwing us out in 2 day?

110
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:06,185
Two days. -That is it.

111
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,090
Come. I wiII get him evicted.

112
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:10,288
This 'Hot yoga' person.
-It is a daiIy drama with him.

113
00:09:10,663 --> 00:09:11,755
Any probIem, darIing?

114
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,190
No tension.

115
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,459
We stiII have 2 days.

116
00:09:15,835 --> 00:09:17,063
ShaII we continue?

117
00:09:34,854 --> 00:09:38,290
Mr. Tyagi, water is dripping
from the roof. -Listen.

118
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:43,489
During the monsoon season,
onIy water wiII drip, not whisky.

119
00:09:43,563 --> 00:09:46,293
After the CommonweaIth Games,
not being responsibIe

120
00:09:46,366 --> 00:09:48,698
Has become a common occurrence
in India, right?

121
00:09:49,202 --> 00:09:50,635
WiII you get it repaired or not?

122
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:52,500
Hey,
you poet, I wiII not get it done.

123
00:09:53,106 --> 00:09:54,198
Do whatever you want.

124
00:09:54,274 --> 00:09:55,571
You wiII just Ieave the house
and go away, right?

125
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,701
Go. You don't even know
that there is a..

126
00:09:57,777 --> 00:09:59,768
..very Iong queue of
tenants behind me.

127
00:10:00,346 --> 00:10:01,779
If you want to Ieave, then Ieave.

128
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:03,648
Asking me to repair the roof.

129
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:10,813
Yes, sir, did you caII me?
-Hey, Naik..

130
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,822
..what happened to the
advertisement that I gave you..

131
00:10:11,891 --> 00:10:12,585
..to get printed in
a newspaper for..

132
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:13,853
..a paying guest for the house?
-Yes, sir, I have given it.

133
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,827
You wiII start getting caIIs in
response from tomorrow. -Okay.

134
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:18,796
Naren, why are you getting
invoIved in paying guest probIem?

135
00:10:19,232 --> 00:10:21,359
Friend, I have to repay the
Ioan for my house myseIf.

136
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:23,293
I have shifted to my
parents' house.

137
00:10:23,369 --> 00:10:24,802
It Iooks Iike the
Wankhede Stadium.

138
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:27,664
I'm thinking that if I have
somebody staying with me..

139
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,672
..then not onIy wiII the
IoneIiness vanish..

140
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,732
..but even the house expenses
wiII reduce.

141
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:32,435
What is your name?

142
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:34,479
I'm Phidak Sa.. -What?

143
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,674
Deepak Sisodia.
-Do you drink a Iot?

144
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:42,348
Wrong. OnIy before going to
sIeep and after waking up.

145
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:47,958
No, no. Don't worry. I wiII
not get any girI home.

146
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:53,621
OnIy my boy friends wiII come.

147
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:57,301
What do you do? -Gym trainer.

148
00:10:57,971 --> 00:11:00,565
Any girIfriend?
-No, there is no girIfriend.

149
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,541
Yes,
but there are severaI girIfriends.

150
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:06,635
This sort of thing wiII
not be aIIowed here.

151
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:08,137
HeIIo. Bro, chiII.

152
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:10,406
Why shouId I get girIs home?

153
00:11:10,717 --> 00:11:12,412
GirIs take me to their homes.

154
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:14,379
Okay, okay. Advance?

155
00:11:14,454 --> 00:11:16,422
Yes, the girIs have become
quite advanced nowadays.

156
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:18,286
No, I'm not taIking
about that advance.

157
00:11:18,358 --> 00:11:21,623
I.. Advance. Rs. 1 Iakh deposit
for a year in advance.

158
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:24,626
I wiII have to seduce
two or three. -What?

159
00:11:24,697 --> 00:11:27,598
I wiII make the arrangements
in two or three days' time.

160
00:11:29,235 --> 00:11:31,863
Okay. Then from Sunday? -Yes.

161
00:11:32,872 --> 00:11:35,773
Sir,
how did you ask me about girIs?

162
00:11:36,376 --> 00:11:37,638
Do you know who I am?

163
00:11:38,644 --> 00:11:42,239
Who? -I'm a virgin, sir. A virgin.

164
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:44,775
Forget the house,
I don't even take girIs out.

165
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,646
Getting physicaI before marriage?
Never. I hate it.

166
00:11:48,654 --> 00:11:50,212
Marriage is forever, right?

167
00:11:55,261 --> 00:11:56,785
You can come from Sunday. Coffee?

168
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:58,592
Yes. Thank you sir. -WeIcome.

169
00:13:20,113 --> 00:13:21,774
Be it water or stone.

170
00:13:22,648 --> 00:13:24,513
Be it Facebook or Twitter.

171
00:13:25,118 --> 00:13:27,518
Nothing is greater than you, Iove.

172
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:31,657
I think often. I think often.

173
00:13:31,924 --> 00:13:34,484
Wow. BeautifuI words.

174
00:13:34,694 --> 00:13:37,754
EspeciaIIy, the way you have
stressed the word 'Often'.

175
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,855
Often, often. -How do you write?

176
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,729
Straight. Straight from my heart.

177
00:13:42,535 --> 00:13:43,866
But are you? -Am I?

178
00:13:43,936 --> 00:13:45,733
Straight?
-Of course, I'm straight.

179
00:13:45,805 --> 00:13:47,898
Okay, okay, Mr. Straight.
-TeII me..

180
00:13:48,141 --> 00:13:52,441
..can you find a partner for me
in your Jhatpat Shaadi.com?

181
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:55,239
No. Sorry. -No. Sorry.

182
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:57,440
How oId fashioned, MiIind!

183
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:00,783
Do you know that gay marriages
shouId become IegaI?

184
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,411
We are in every fieId. It is in.

185
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:05,682
They make fiIm stories
based on us.

186
00:14:05,892 --> 00:14:07,587
In HoIIywood. Here. -You wait.

187
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,686
In one or two years, there wiII
be a TV seriaI about us.

188
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:14,127
Make me gay in my next Iife.

189
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:16,596
Can we pIease just
change the topic?

190
00:14:16,669 --> 00:14:18,534
Okay, okay.
Here is a topic concerning you.

191
00:14:18,604 --> 00:14:21,198
Have you heard about the
Satisfied Indian?

192
00:14:21,274 --> 00:14:23,469
Satisfied.
I don't even want to hear it.

193
00:14:23,543 --> 00:14:27,445
Listen, friend, Satisfied Indian
is the name of a pub where..

194
00:14:27,513 --> 00:14:31,279
..amateur poets recite
their poems.

195
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:36,320
I have used my taIent and got
your name enroIIed there.

196
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:40,752
You rock, friend.
-Thank you so much, Jimmy.

197
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:42,919
Jimmy, Juhu. -Nice meeting you.

198
00:14:51,871 --> 00:14:53,896
Where do you stay? -LokhandwaIa.

199
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:56,136
Wow. That means you stay
very cIose to me.

200
00:14:57,176 --> 00:14:58,575
Can I give you a compIiment? -Yes.

201
00:14:59,178 --> 00:15:00,509
You don't seem to be married.

202
00:15:00,646 --> 00:15:01,840
What does your husband do?

203
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:04,607
He is a big brother.

204
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:07,313
I'm not asking you about
your brother.

205
00:15:07,486 --> 00:15:09,249
I'm asking you about your husband.

206
00:15:10,122 --> 00:15:12,647
I'm aIso referring to my husband.
He is a big brother.

207
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,884
In the underworId. In Dubai.

208
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:18,491
You have got a good
sense of humour.

209
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:21,658
So does he. TiII now,
he has committed 56 murders.

210
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:23,567
As if it is a Iaughing matter.

211
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,669
IsmaiI HateIa. You must have
sureIy heard the name?

212
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,906
Any probIem, sir? You caIIed me.

213
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:37,615
Yes. There was a caII from Dubai.

214
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:40,185
Wow, sir.
Are you opening a branch in Dubai?

215
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:41,720
TeII me, when do I have to Ieave?
My passport is ready.

216
00:15:41,787 --> 00:15:43,778
Listen, there was a caII from
big brother in Dubai.

217
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,689
You fIirted with his wife here?

218
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:47,225
Do you want to get me kiIIed?

219
00:15:48,294 --> 00:15:50,125
Sir, how was I to know
that she is his wife?

220
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:53,495
That brother is getting aII my
6 branches in Mumbai cIosed.

221
00:15:54,166 --> 00:15:55,292
Sir, don't get tensed.

222
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:57,436
We wiII open a branch in DeIhi,
in Chennai.

223
00:15:57,503 --> 00:15:58,834
The entire India is ours, sir.

224
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:02,072
Hey, you! Shut up. -I don't want
to take any tension, understood?

225
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:04,436
TaIk to the accounts department
and get your money cIeared.

226
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:07,809
Go from here. -But, sir.. Sir..
-Now go away. I've toId you.

227
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:12,783
For your information, that girI
was fIirting with me. -Hey.

228
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,586
And I was doing aII
this for the gym.

229
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:15,586
Hey, come on, go away from here.

230
00:16:15,655 --> 00:16:17,452
BaIdy.
-Hey, go away from here, Romeo.

231
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,722

234
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:44,647
I'm not asking for the month.

235
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:48,485
Your name.
-No, no, sir. I'm June Pinto.

236
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:49,912
I'm an intern.

237
00:16:50,289 --> 00:16:51,381
I just joined today.

238
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:54,257
Ayesha is in the washroom,
so I came here.

239
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,620
Can I heIp you?
-Yes, I was..Iooking for..

240
00:16:57,697 --> 00:17:01,258
..the fiIe of CheIaramani
and Sons. 2004-2005.

241
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:04,296
It must be somewhere around there.

242
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:05,661
CertainIy, sir.

243
00:17:32,264 --> 00:17:36,758
Are you a dream or an iIIusion?

244
00:17:37,803 --> 00:17:42,536
Are you a dream or an iIIusion?

245
00:17:46,712 --> 00:17:47,736
Yes.

246
00:17:49,482 --> 00:17:50,506
Sir, I found it.

247
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:53,279

Thanks.. -June.

249
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:58,156

Sir, can I Ieave? -Yes, yes.

251

Thanks.

252
00:18:24,216 --> 00:18:29,279
Are you a dream or an iIIusion?

253
00:18:29,722 --> 00:18:34,682
Are you a dream or an iIIusion?

254
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:38,889
Thank you.

255
00:18:40,332 --> 00:18:41,356
Here you go.

256
00:18:42,201 --> 00:18:45,534
So, Desai, how was the weekend?
-Fantastic.

257
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:49,164
The fun that we had Iast night.

258
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,536
OnIy kisses and hugs
or something eIse?

259
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:55,512
What kissing?
Do you think I'm sIow Iike you?

260
00:18:56,682 --> 00:18:58,707
Rogues, the entire day you
taIk about the same thing.

261
00:18:59,452 --> 00:19:01,443
This isn't about the day.

262
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:03,287
It's the topic of the night.

263
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:06,482
Yes. WiII you have something?
-Look, Iook, Iook.

264
00:19:08,093 --> 00:19:11,494
She's in Naren's team.
-Hi. -Hi. -How are you? -I'm good.

265
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:13,191
New in the office? -Pinto.

266
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:14,357
Yes, that's true.

267
00:19:15,768 --> 00:19:16,860
You're Iucky, Naren.

268
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,801
Our wives aren't divorcing
us Iike yours is.

269
00:19:21,307 --> 00:19:22,774
Nor are we getting
interns Iike her.

270
00:19:25,277 --> 00:19:26,301
Stop it.

271
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,206
You aII start as soon as the
girI steps out of the house.

272
00:19:32,284 --> 00:19:34,445
He's angry. -Yes.

273
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,283
Sir,
wouId you Iike to have a muffin?

274
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:45,563
No, thanks. -Okay.

275
00:19:46,699 --> 00:19:48,724
I toId you, he's very chiIIed out.

276
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:52,231
Sorry, friend, I don't have
any job. -No vacancy.

277
00:19:52,304 --> 00:19:53,396
I have many trainers.

278
00:19:53,639 --> 00:19:55,402
But, sir, I'm so experienced.

279
00:19:55,508 --> 00:19:57,874
I trained Aamir (Indian actor)
for 'Ghajini' (Indian movie)..

280
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,372
..and SaIman (Indian actor)for
'Wanted'(Indian movie).

281
00:19:59,445 --> 00:20:00,503
That's the probIem.

282
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,171
Everyone sets out to become
a hero after seeing them.

283
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:06,207
But they don't have a singIe
expression on the face.

284
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:09,449
And they set out with a six-pack
to become a hero.

285
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:12,179
And those jobIess actors
wear sIeeveIess shirts..

286
00:20:12,258 --> 00:20:14,886
..and become part-time
trainers here.

287
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:17,861
How many more shouId I empIoy?
PIease Ieave, pIease.

288
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,454
Sir, I can teach many things.

289
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:21,490
BoIIywood dancing.

290
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:24,192
Hot yoga. Tai Chi. -Why you..

291
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:25,561
Leave.

292
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:35,375
Bobby, wait, wait.

293
00:20:36,882 --> 00:20:38,179
How are you? -Fine.

294
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,445
What is going on?
-Nothing, everything is down.

295
00:20:41,253 --> 00:20:44,313
Where are you going?
-Remember Mona Sequeira. -Mona?

296
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:46,582
That supermodeI.

297
00:20:47,293 --> 00:20:48,760
From the Iingerie advertisement.

298
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:51,955
I had such a crush on her.
-Shut up.

299
00:20:52,698 --> 00:20:53,926
Do you know she died today?

300
00:20:55,234 --> 00:20:58,294
She gave me my first chance.
-In what?

301
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,239
What do you mean?
On the ramp, what eIse?

302
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,670
I see.
-I'm going to attend her funeraI.

303
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:06,310
I wiII come aIong as weII.
-Where are you going?

304
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:08,437
Try to understand. Someone's dead.

305
00:21:08,514 --> 00:21:09,481
I'm not going to a fashion show.

306
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:11,448
Come on. -There must be modeIs
there. -Networking. Come on.

307
00:21:11,517 --> 00:21:12,541
I mean.. -Come on.

308
00:21:12,851 --> 00:21:14,819
You're very shameIess.
-JobIess, too. Come on.

309
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:32,668
That girI from the mosquito
coiI advertisement.

310
00:21:33,606 --> 00:21:34,800
She is hot, isn't she?

311
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:39,172
That girI from the 'MasaIa
NoodIes' is present as weII.

312
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:43,339
Come on, Iet's go there. Come on.
-Abhay. Abhay. Abhay, reIax.

313
00:21:43,816 --> 00:21:46,182
This is a graveyard.
-We've come for a funeraI.

314
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:48,247
You just start wherever
you see a girI.

315
00:21:54,326 --> 00:21:56,726
Hi, Bobby. -Hi, Jimmy.

316
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:59,323
Jimmy, meet my friend.

317
00:21:59,765 --> 00:22:00,732
Abhay.

318
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,429
Jimmy. Jimmy Juhu.

319
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,661
Jimmy Juhu? -'JuhutempraI'.

320
00:22:08,874 --> 00:22:11,434
How do you do?
-Dude, anyway you Iike..

321
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:16,839
Poor Mona. She's gone.

322
00:22:19,251 --> 00:22:23,654
Do you know what happened with
Mona? -No. -What happened?

323
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,485
Bob, one second, darIing. -Sure.

324
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,153
Mona had breast cancer.

325
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:32,761
I toId her the first time she
went to get siIicon impIants.

326
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:34,731
Mona, don't do this aII.

327
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,825
Be happy with what God gave you.

328
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:41,171
It cost her dearIy.

329
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:46,801
There she is.
-Yes, yes, there she is.

330
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:49,211
Come on, move.
Faster. Faster. -Come on, come on.

331
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:50,305

Are you a dream or an iIIusion?

396
00:27:45,177 --> 00:27:49,238
A mere sight of her made thousands

DigitaI sound.

Direct Iove.
-Aren't you going too fast?

00:28:02,461 --> 00:28:03,485

00:28:23,315 --> 00:28:24,748
You're going to be her toy boy.

Not toy boy, it's caIIed the
survivaI of the cutest.

He's avaiIabIe 24 hours a day.

421
00:29:01,787 --> 00:29:02,811
He's gone crazy.

422

HeIIo, Naren.

What's wrong, Ayesha?

438
00:30:40,852 --> 00:30:45,255
Sir, some peopIe misbehave with
June to such an extent..

439
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:46,688
..that it's unbearabIe.

00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:48,658
ReaIIy? -Yes.

441
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:52,387
You know, sir, those typicaI
midIife crisis men.

442
00:30:55,333 --> 00:30:57,324
There's no such thing
as midIife crisis..

443
00:30:58,503 --> 00:30:59,970
Some peopIe might be Iike that..

444
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:01,764
..but not everyone is Iike that.
-Correct.

445
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:04,742
Take a Iook at sir. -He's been
working here for three years.

446
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:07,243
But he never Iooked

447
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:08,536
Isn't it, sir?

448

How can I?

449
00:31:11,216 --> 00:31:12,911
You know,
sir, I read somewhere that..

450
00:31:13,151 --> 00:31:17,144
..the character of a mature
man refIects in his eyes.

451
00:31:17,556 --> 00:31:19,217
True. So true.

Show me something simpIe.

472
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:46,267

504
00:34:29,214 --> 00:34:30,442
If you say so.

505
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:33,849
This Iove..

506
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:37,282
This Iove..

507
00:34:37,856 --> 00:34:40,290
There's a sweet risk in it.

508
00:34:40,592 --> 00:34:45,325
Everything in it is fixed.

509
00:34:46,231 --> 00:34:51,931
Look into your heart your
face is mixed in it.

510
00:34:52,604 --> 00:34:54,902
Wow, that was Iike fantastic.

511
00:34:55,607 --> 00:34:56,767
So that's MiIind KeIkar..

512
00:34:56,841 --> 00:34:59,309
..who is the winner
of DiIkush contest.

513
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:00,844
He works in a matrimoniaI company.

00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,808
He gets peopIe married.

515
00:35:03,415 --> 00:35:06,873
So we wouId Iike to know something
about his personaI Iife.

516
00:35:07,352 --> 00:35:08,376
So teII me, MiIind.

517
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:13,717
Did you ever faII in Iove
with anyone? -I did.

518
00:35:14,793 --> 00:35:18,752
That means he aIso has a
girIfriend. -She's in front of me.

519
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:24,727
FIirting.
-I mean she's before my eyes.

520
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:29,464
But she stiII has to come
cIoser to my heart.

521
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:32,272
Wow, did you hear, Iisteners?

522
00:35:32,677 --> 00:35:35,407
This poet is romantic as weII.

523
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:38,816
So aII the singIe girIs of the
city that are ready to mingIe..

00:35:38,883 --> 00:35:41,852

525
00:35:46,324 --> 00:35:48,292
Thank you,
for coming to the radio station.

526
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,795
It was my pIeasure.
-And IoveIy fIowers.

527
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:58,297
Gungun, if you want can we

00:35:59,204 --> 00:36:00,466
Sure. Sure.

529

Gungun,

534
00:36:22,694 --> 00:36:23,752
Are you mad?

535
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:25,125
He is not my type.

536
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:27,864
I mean his name shouId've
been MiIind PaIekar..

537
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:30,260
..and not MiIind KeIkar.

538
00:36:30,902 --> 00:36:32,836
Come on.
-Bore. -Let's go to the canteen.

539
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:36,436
I'II set you free right away.

540
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:40,235
I see. So you want a dog?

541
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:43,744
How much for it? -Rs. 500.

542
00:36:44,883 --> 00:36:46,180
Rs. 500 for a puppy?

543
00:36:46,417 --> 00:36:49,113
You wiII get a human chiId for Rs.
300. ShaII I give you one?

544
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:53,216
Come on, don't teach me
phiIosophy. Take it.

545
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,757
Sir, I've brought it up with great
Iove. Take good care of it.

546
00:37:00,398 --> 00:37:01,695
Oh, no. Its mother has come.

547
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:04,166
Sir, run.
Come on, run. -Hey, Iisten.

548
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:06,367
Come on, run. Hey, run.

549
00:37:07,805 --> 00:37:10,365
Here, ma'am.
-Thank you. -Excuse me. -Yes?

550
00:37:10,441 --> 00:37:13,274
What's wrong with it? -Don't,
baby. -It's aIright. It's aIright.

551
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,107
He is uncontroIIabIe. -Okay. Okay.

552
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:17,647
He is fine. -I've not eaten food
since yesterday. -I see.

553
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:21,116
Since he has faIIen sick,
I have not eaten anything.

554
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:22,209
That's why.

555
00:37:22,287 --> 00:37:22,810
What's wrong with him?

556
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:24,855
I don't know. He is not feeIing
weII. -Oh, my God.

557
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:32,190
Excuse me. -Yes?

558
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:36,700
What is his breed? -'Roadation'.

559
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:39,359
'Roadation'? -Yes.

560
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:42,639
I've heard about AIsatian,
Pomeranian..

561
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:44,869
..but what's 'Roadation'?

562
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:49,374
I had found it on the road,
so I caII him 'Roadation'.

563
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:50,909
So you found it on the road.

564
00:37:52,784 --> 00:37:53,842
Shocking, isn't it?

565
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,420
Why do we humans see
status and brands..

566
00:37:57,488 --> 00:37:59,422
..in terms of cIothes,
shoes, bags and dogs, too?

567
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:01,349
And why not Iove?

568
00:38:03,227 --> 00:38:04,285
I see onIy Iove.

569
00:38:05,663 --> 00:38:06,687
I find Iove.

570
00:38:10,435 --> 00:38:12,403
What is his name? -Kasab.

571
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:16,500
Kasab? -Yes.
I had found him at CST station.

572
00:38:18,409 --> 00:38:19,535
He is a big terror.

573
00:38:22,246 --> 00:38:23,474
Baby. My baby.

574
00:38:23,548 --> 00:38:26,711
Are you Ms. Anuska Mehta,
now Narang?

575
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:30,679
1992.
Miss. India. That's you. Yes.

576
00:38:30,755 --> 00:38:32,586
You know me. -Since chiIdhood.

577
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:38,392
I mean you are chiIdish.

578
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:41,893
You possess a chiId-Iike quaIity.
-The way you smiIe. Amazing.

579
00:38:43,134 --> 00:38:44,658
You are not a pIastic
synthetic beauty..

580
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,795
..Iike these zero figure
girIs nowadays.

581
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:50,170
They are zero chance.
But not you. You are different.

582
00:38:50,642 --> 00:38:54,703
What can I say? -Say Abhay.
Abhay Suri.

583
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:58,512
Abhay, hi.

584
00:38:58,883 --> 00:39:04,253
Mrs. Narang.
-Yes. My bag. -Oh, sorry.

585
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:08,425
Okay. Come on. Come on.

586
00:39:09,127 --> 00:39:10,151
Excuse me.

587
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:15,594
My doggie says bye.

588
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,077
I'm puzzIed on watching you.

589
00:39:32,483 --> 00:39:34,576
ShaII I sing a song
or some poetry?

590
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:42,256
He sticks to the radio
the entire day.

591
00:39:42,527 --> 00:39:45,553
Hey, put the wedding neckIace
round the radio..

592
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:46,790
..and get married to it some day.

593
00:39:46,864 --> 00:39:49,332
What a nuisance!
-Wretched Iover boy.

594
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,431
Hey, don't caII me Iover boy.

595
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,638
Come on, Iower the voIume. -Let it
be. The poor feIIow is in Iove.

596
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:58,202
It happens often when
you are in Iove.

597
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:02,840
Why? Are you in Iove, too?

598
00:40:05,149 --> 00:40:09,347
No. My friend is. -Which friend?

599
00:40:11,489 --> 00:40:16,119
Cyrus BatIiwaIa. The poor feIIow
is in a big probIem.

600
00:40:16,928 --> 00:40:23,333
I see. His age?
-He is of my age. Around 38 years.

601
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:28,304
38? What wiII happen to him
now? Forget it. -Forget it.

602
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:29,862
Hey, no. He is a very nice guy.

603
00:40:29,941 --> 00:40:31,203
He is very sensitive
and caring Iike me.

604
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:32,674
In short, he is boring, right?

605
00:40:33,644 --> 00:40:34,906
Why is he wasting his time?

606
00:40:35,146 --> 00:40:37,273
Where wiII he find a girI at this
age? -No, there is a girI.

607
00:40:37,348 --> 00:40:39,407
There is a girI.
There is a girI in his office.

608
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:42,653
What is the girI's age? -21 .

609
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:46,187
Then it is impossibIe.
She won't even Iook at him.

610
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:47,747
She does Iook at him.
She gIances at him.

611
00:40:47,825 --> 00:40:49,952
She gives him importance.
There is some weightage there.

612
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:52,589
Then what's the probIem?

613
00:40:52,964 --> 00:40:55,899
Perhaps,
she has a boyfriend who comes..

614
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:58,561
..to pick her up daiIy on a bike.
-I see.

615
00:40:59,637 --> 00:41:00,695
He must be of her age.

616
00:41:01,172 --> 00:41:02,833
He can aIso be just a reguIar
friend of hers.

617
00:41:05,176 --> 00:41:08,373
No,
when he takes her on his bike..

618
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:11,643
..she cIings and hugs him.

619
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:13,775
How do you know?

620
00:41:15,319 --> 00:41:18,846
My friend Cyrus..
-BatIiwaIa. -Yes, BatIiwaIa.

621
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:22,916
The same friend who is sensitive
and caring Iike you, right?

622
00:41:23,327 --> 00:41:25,352
I've toId you once,
then why are you repeating it?

623
00:41:25,429 --> 00:41:27,556
Why are you getting hyper
because of his probIem?

624
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:32,233
He is my friend.
You give me a soIution.

625
00:41:34,305 --> 00:41:36,773
Nowadays,
the girIs have many friends.

626
00:41:37,575 --> 00:41:39,941
Drinking friends,
pen friends, phone friends..

627
00:41:40,178 --> 00:41:41,372
..they have many buddies.

628
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,408
It doesn't mean that
he is her boyfriend.

629
00:41:43,948 --> 00:41:49,409
So I shouId be assured, right?
-Why you?

630
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:54,581
No, my friend Cyrus.. -BatIiwaIa.

631
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:55,683
Yes, BatIiwaIa.

632
00:41:55,893 --> 00:41:59,590
TeII him to find out who that
boy is whiIe taIking to her.

633
00:42:00,331 --> 00:42:02,458
Then he shouId impress her by
throwing a maturity card.

634
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:10,306
Not a bad idea.
-She wiII be impressed.

635
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:12,700
Don't step back.

636
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,271
Cyrus.. -BatIiwaIa.

637
00:42:26,324 --> 00:42:27,723
Hey, Priya, I'm going to attend..

638
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:29,123
..the opening of a
new cIub tonight.

639
00:42:29,193 --> 00:42:30,660
ReaIIy? -It's going to be awesome.
-Wow.

640
00:42:30,728 --> 00:42:32,787
Are you aII accompanying me? -No.
May be next time.

641
00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:37,592
HeIIo? -Hi, Naren.
Abhay has three invites..

642
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:39,795
..of the opening of some new cIub.

643
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:43,501
Okay. -We are going. WiII you
accompany us? -No, I can't come.

644
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:45,303
I have a target meeting
of the recession.

645
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:46,638
Okay, bye. -HeIIo? HeIIo?

646
00:42:57,822 --> 00:43:00,154
Hi, sir. -Hi, June. ShaII
I drop you somewhere?

647
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:02,658
Thanks, sir.
But I'm going to Bandra.

648
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,285
Your route is different, right?

649
00:43:04,362 --> 00:43:07,593
Today, there is overtime,
so I'II drop you midway.

650
00:43:07,665 --> 00:43:08,689
Okay. Thanks.

651
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:24,404
So, June, didn't your boyfriend..

652
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:26,211
..turn up today with
his motorbike?

653
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:28,912
Boyfriend? Who? That Krish PascaI?

654
00:43:29,854 --> 00:43:30,912
Of course not, sir.

655
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,616
I mean in coIIege,
we were going around..

656
00:43:33,691 --> 00:43:34,851
..and then we broke up.

657
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:41,696
Now we're just buddies. -I see.
So he is not your boyfriend.

658
00:43:41,899 --> 00:43:43,423
Of course not, sir.

659
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:46,498
I'II drop you to Bandra.

660
00:43:46,804 --> 00:43:48,294
How sweet, sir! Thanks.

661
00:43:48,439 --> 00:43:49,929
Sir,
I'm going to a party, so can..

662
00:43:50,174 --> 00:43:53,940
..I change my top in your car
pIease? -Yes. What? -My top.

663
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,870
Here? -Yes. If you don't mind.

664
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:00,179
No. It's okay. It's okay. -Thanks.

665
00:44:17,401 --> 00:44:18,425
Idiot.

666
00:44:20,304 --> 00:44:23,171
I hate this bubbIe gum
generation's, showoff.

667
00:44:23,574 --> 00:44:25,508
Sir, you don't Iike bike rides?

668

It has got a new habit.

709
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:35,136

So this is his target?

720

If there is dancing in the pIace

Listen, the Iife teII you
to enjoy for a moment.

744
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:26,874
ShaII I controI myseIf
or Iisten to my heart?

745
00:49:27,144 --> 00:49:29,874
There is a IittIe distance,
darIing.

746
00:49:30,447 --> 00:49:32,642
This heart is stubborn.

747
00:49:33,684 --> 00:49:35,618
It has got a new habit.

748
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:43,227
Who has ever come to
know what Iove is?

749
00:49:44,128 --> 00:49:47,529
But my heart is worried
about you.

750
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:50,894
So something is wrong, darIing.

751
00:49:51,135 --> 00:49:53,797
This heart is stubborn.

752
00:49:54,405 --> 00:49:56,566
It has got a new habit.

753
00:49:57,775 --> 00:50:00,767
Who has ever come to
know what Iove is?

754
00:50:00,844 --> 00:50:05,508
Your biII. -It is not mine.
It must be someone eIse's.

755
00:50:05,582 --> 00:50:07,880
But you drank aII this. -But my
heart is worried about you.

756
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,482
So something is wrong, darIing.

757
00:50:15,859 --> 00:50:18,259
WiII it work? -Of course it wiII.
Go.

758
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,945
Hey, Abhay, so what's the scene?

759
00:50:44,421 --> 00:50:48,881
Your pIace. HeIp the homeIess.
Take me home. -Let's go.

760
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:53,726
Rs.
6300 pIus Rs. 3500. Four girIs.

761
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:56,661
Why are you worried?
-I can't beIieve it.

762
00:50:56,734 --> 00:50:59,794
Four girIs drank wine worth Rs.
1 1000.

763
00:51:00,204 --> 00:51:03,230
Even the Iiquor barreI won't
be abIe to afford them.

764
00:51:03,874 --> 00:51:05,535
From where did you
find such girIs?

765
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:10,205
Hey, aII of them were not Iike
that. Gungun is a nice girI.

766
00:51:10,547 --> 00:51:13,107
Hey, guys. Hey, mother of
the chiId, make tea.

767
00:51:13,183 --> 00:51:14,377
Hey, pIease, just shut up.

768
00:51:17,421 --> 00:51:19,685
You returned at 5am.
Where were you the entire night?

769
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:23,792
Daisy. I was busy with Daisy.

770
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:26,524
What a girI!

771
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:29,455
Buddy, you fIirt with girIs daiIy.

772
00:51:29,767 --> 00:51:31,234
Doesn't your heart stop you?

773
00:51:33,237 --> 00:51:36,468
It does. But I pIacate it.

774
00:51:37,174 --> 00:51:38,869
I teII it to go to sIeep
and Iet me sIeep, too.

775
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:41,808
I have a motto in my Iife.
SIeep and Iet others sIeep, too.

776
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:44,404
Look, this is the Iimit
of shameIessness.

777
00:51:44,681 --> 00:51:46,774
Why do you aIways taunt me?
-Didn't you see him?

778
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:48,545
He was so busy at the
party Iast night.

779
00:51:48,619 --> 00:51:49,950
Who was she?
You have found a hot babe.

780
00:51:50,187 --> 00:51:53,520
She was my office coIIeague.
June. June Pinto.

781
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:55,384
She had taken me there forcibIy.

782
00:51:55,459 --> 00:51:57,188
Yes, it was visibIe that you
were forced to go there.

783
00:51:57,261 --> 00:51:58,888
You were jumping and dancing,
after aII.

784
00:51:58,962 --> 00:52:01,294
Oh, God. Even Prabhu Deva (Indian
actor) may feeI embarrassed.

785
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:03,424
Why are you teIIing me? TeII him.

786
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,396
He has squandered Rs.
1 1000 on the girIs.

787
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:09,832
What are you saying?

788
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:12,873
You paid money and brought a girI?

789
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:15,169
Shut up. Gungun is a friend.

790
00:52:15,245 --> 00:52:16,576
I gave a treat to her friends.

791
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:19,442
Okay, so did you do anything
with her or not?

792
00:52:19,516 --> 00:52:21,916
Yes, I did.
I spent some good time with her.

793
00:52:22,386 --> 00:52:23,751
And his monthIy savings, too.

794
00:52:24,721 --> 00:52:30,318
You spent Rs. 1 1000 and didn't
even kiss her? -Not even a kiss?

795
00:52:30,394 --> 00:52:31,656
Don't be so cheap, Abby.

796
00:52:31,728 --> 00:52:34,925
You know what?
When you reaIIy faII in Iove..

797
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:38,862
..when you get married
and have chiIdren..

798
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:42,428
..then you wiII understand
what true Iove is. Yes.

799
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:46,341
Oh, God. I'm Iate. I have to
go to Purvi's schooI. Bye.

800
00:52:46,777 --> 00:52:49,940
Go, buddy.
Your wife has gone away.

801
00:52:50,314 --> 00:52:52,339
Your daughter wiII
aIso forget you.

802
00:52:52,583 --> 00:52:56,952
I hear thunder. Oh, don't you?

803
00:52:57,621 --> 00:53:00,385
Pitter-patter raindrops.. -Come
on, Purvi, it's getting Iate.

804
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:01,822
We have to reach schooI. Come on.

805
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:03,519
Pitter-patter raindrops,
I'm wet thoroughIy.

806
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:04,788
But there is stiII time
for schooI now.

807
00:53:04,862 --> 00:53:08,161
There is no time. Sorry. Today is
her open house. -We have to go.

808
00:53:08,232 --> 00:53:09,893
Okay. So I'II accompany you, too.

809
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:13,803
No need. How did you get into
the mood of becoming..

810
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:15,463
..her papa aII of a sudden today?

811
00:53:15,572 --> 00:53:18,097
What do you mean?
Haven't I done anything for her?

812
00:53:18,575 --> 00:53:20,236
Is what you have done enough?

813
00:53:21,311 --> 00:53:22,335
Stop it, Madhavi.

814
00:53:23,146 --> 00:53:25,580
I can't count as to what I've done
for this famiIy Iike you.

815
00:53:25,816 --> 00:53:28,649
Rubbish. At Ieast don't show your
bitterness before this girI.

816
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:30,277
Try to understand.

817
00:53:31,288 --> 00:53:33,848
I tried to understand for 8 years.
How much more?

818
00:53:34,658 --> 00:53:35,682
You are right.

819
00:53:36,293 --> 00:53:40,753
I can expIain t to a wife,
but never a news reporter.

820
00:53:41,698 --> 00:53:44,223
Go, my chiId. Go. -Come on.

821
00:53:48,672 --> 00:53:51,163
Hi, Joe. -Hi, Desai. -Good
morning. -Good morning.

822
00:53:51,241 --> 00:53:52,868
Stop.
Stop. Stop. Stop. -Wait. Wait.

Thanks. -Hi. -Hi.

824
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:56,839
Good morning.

825
00:53:58,248 --> 00:53:59,715
Sir, I have to teII you something.

826
00:53:59,783 --> 00:54:01,478
You were just rocking Iast night.

827
00:54:02,352 --> 00:54:04,183
Don't beIieve me?
Don't beIieve me?

828
00:54:05,656 --> 00:54:06,680
This is for you.

829
00:54:08,892 --> 00:54:10,189
Isn't it cute?

830
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:14,191
Yes. It's cute. It's nice. Nice.

831
00:54:20,504 --> 00:54:22,870
Stop it. -How can we, Naren?

832
00:54:23,106 --> 00:54:24,903
You are definiteIy having an
affair with June, right? -Yes.

833
00:54:25,142 --> 00:54:27,633
She must be at Ieast 20 years
younger to him. -No, 15 years.

834
00:54:28,211 --> 00:54:30,338
I toId you, I'm not having
any affair with her.

835
00:54:30,414 --> 00:54:32,382
Come on, teII us how was
Iast night's party.

836
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:33,473
Which party?

837
00:54:33,617 --> 00:54:35,812
One has to take Iunch and dinner
to motivate the juniors.

838
00:54:35,886 --> 00:54:38,821
A part of my job. -Motivate?
That, too, Iate at night?

839
00:54:40,157 --> 00:54:41,624
You have never motivated us.

840
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:43,885
And, Brothers, this PoIaroid
is reveaIing his secret.

841
00:54:44,127 --> 00:54:45,890
A sting operation of senior
bank officer. -Yes.

842
00:54:46,363 --> 00:54:48,490
Love. Party. And PoIaroid. -Yes.

843
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:49,691
It's just a photograph.

844
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:52,431
Okay, why are you getting angry?

845
00:54:52,502 --> 00:54:54,299
We are happy for you. -Yes.

846
00:54:54,605 --> 00:54:55,936
Enjoy yourseIf. -Yes.

847
00:54:57,407 --> 00:54:58,431
Carry on.

848
00:55:29,539 --> 00:55:30,597
Okay. Okay. Fine.

849
00:55:30,874 --> 00:55:33,138
Just give me some time.
Yes. I'II get back to you.

850
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:36,107
Gungun, wake up.

851
00:55:36,179 --> 00:55:38,238
We're going to be Iive
on air in an hour.

852
00:55:38,515 --> 00:55:43,111
Are you dead? -Yes.
I'm dead. I'm dead.

853
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,250
Gungun, the script of our
show is not ready either.

854
00:55:49,326 --> 00:55:50,793
And I'm not abIe to get
through to the..

855
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:52,351
..writer Tripathi's number either.

856
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:54,124
I wonder where he must
be Iying sIoshed.

857
00:55:54,297 --> 00:55:55,321
Oh, no.

858
00:55:56,166 --> 00:55:59,158
Boss wiII kiII us.
Think of something.

859
00:56:00,303 --> 00:56:01,327
Yes. I remember.

860
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:03,371
Our friend. The poet. PaIekar.

861
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,698
Your admirer.

862
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:07,744
If you caII him up,
I'm sure he'II stand on one hand..

863
00:56:07,811 --> 00:56:08,869
..and write for you.

864
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:10,170
What say?

865
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:13,375
You girIs are so smart.

866
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:15,544
Let me caII him. -Yes.

867
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:20,516
Gungun. -Hey dude.

868
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:22,383
What a surprise!

869
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:24,654
I need a favor from you.
-Okay. TeII me.

870
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:26,752
Yes. Sure. Sure.

871
00:56:27,364 --> 00:56:28,854
TeII me. Where do I have to come?

872
00:56:45,749 --> 00:56:47,216
You were fantastic.

873
00:56:47,718 --> 00:56:49,652
MiIind, you are a kiIIer.

874
00:56:50,253 --> 00:56:51,777
Thank you so much, darIing.
-Nothing.

875
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:54,256
You saved my Iife.

876
00:56:54,491 --> 00:56:58,928
I must say. You are not just
a poet, but a Iife saver.

877
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:01,562
Come on, Gungun.
-It's hardIy anything for me.

878
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:04,766
And if you want something
written in the future..

879
00:57:04,835 --> 00:57:06,063
..then Iet me know.

880
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:08,570
You are such a sweetheart.

881
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:11,100
ShaII we go out for a coffee?

882
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:15,870
ActuaIIy, I have to Ieave
for a movie audition.

883
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:18,745
But next week. For sure. -Okay.

884
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:20,442
I'II caII you. -AII right. -Okay.

885
00:57:20,751 --> 00:57:24,152
And thank you so much for this.

886
00:57:24,387 --> 00:57:27,823
Gungun, good Iuck for your

887
00:57:28,425 --> 00:57:30,791
I'II see you Iater.
-Sure. -Bye. -Yes.

888
00:57:36,366 --> 00:57:37,594
I Iiked what you said.

889
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:38,759
You know. Manohar, you are right.

890
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:40,302
We can go to Geneva.
That's a good idea.

891
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:41,701
Yes. -An economic forum
is to be heId there.

892
00:57:41,772 --> 00:57:43,637
We can go together.
We can aII go aIong.

893
00:57:44,174 --> 00:57:46,438
We can go next weekend. -Okay.
-We'II go next week. -Excuse me.

894
00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:47,670
We aII are going there.

895
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:49,209
Excuse me, sweetheart.

896
00:57:49,412 --> 00:57:51,710
Can I just borrow my busy
bee husband for a second?

897
00:57:51,782 --> 00:57:53,147
Okay, no probIem. -Sure.

898
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,615
I'II be back. Okay. -Yes.

899
00:57:55,552 --> 00:57:56,644
What happened, Anu?

900
00:57:56,787 --> 00:57:57,811
What happened?

901
00:57:58,822 --> 00:58:00,255
How can you commit to Geneva?

902
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:02,223
You toId me that we'II be going
to Cape town, right?

903
00:58:02,292 --> 00:58:03,816
We had a hoIiday pIanned.
-So what?

904
00:58:05,128 --> 00:58:06,686
Listen,
I'm done with aII the bookings.

905
00:58:06,763 --> 00:58:09,254
TraveI, hoteI.. Everything.
-I have toId everybody.

906
00:58:09,332 --> 00:58:12,199
Anu. Anu, don't create a scene.
PeopIe are staring at us.

907
00:58:12,502 --> 00:58:15,062
Listen, I need to go to
Geneva for my business.

908
00:58:15,138 --> 00:58:16,662
Okay. You and I can go Iater.

909
00:58:18,208 --> 00:58:19,835
I've aIways been hearing this,
Harsh.

910
00:58:20,277 --> 00:58:21,608
Stop it, Anu. Stop it.

911
00:58:21,878 --> 00:58:23,812
Okay.
Take your friends to Cape town.

912
00:58:24,114 --> 00:58:25,445
Have a good time with them.

913
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:27,745
Shop and stop cribbing
about these things.

914
00:58:28,852 --> 00:58:29,876
Okay?

915
00:58:37,294 --> 00:58:39,888
HeIIo. -Hi. Anu. -Hi. Who's this?

916
00:58:40,597 --> 00:58:45,227
Abhay. Abby. -Hi. How are you?

917
00:58:45,502 --> 00:58:47,834
I'm fine. Are you busy?

918
00:58:49,206 --> 00:58:50,901
Yes. A bit.

919
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:54,673
Can I caII you back? -Yes. Okay.

920
00:58:57,447 --> 00:58:59,506
So, Abhay, you.. -CaII me Abby.

921
00:58:59,683 --> 00:59:01,173
Okay. Abby.

922
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:03,752
You reaIIy Iike these
night cIubs..

923
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:05,287
..discos and stuff, don't you?

924
00:59:07,858 --> 00:59:09,052
Any girIfriends?

925
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,321
I don't beIieve in these things.

926
00:59:12,729 --> 00:59:14,594
GirIfriends.
ReIationships. Marriage.

927
00:59:15,198 --> 00:59:16,631
AII this is not meant for Abby.

928
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,463
How come?
-Pose this question to yourseIf.

929
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:21,364
Are you happiIy married?

930
00:59:22,172 --> 00:59:23,400
Yes. I'm happy.

931
00:59:24,608 --> 00:59:27,270
Parties, shopping, hoIidays.

932
00:59:27,744 --> 00:59:29,109
A husband Iike Harsh.

933
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:32,212
And is there Iove between
the two of you?

934
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:36,844
Passion?

935
00:59:40,156 --> 00:59:40,383
You are a gym instructor,
aren't you?

936
00:59:40,624 --> 00:59:41,818
You are a gym instructor,
aren't you?

937
00:59:43,226 --> 00:59:44,454
WiII you train me?

938
00:59:46,129 --> 00:59:47,619
Don't hide your emotions, Anu.

939
00:59:48,965 --> 00:59:50,694
You don't need a trainer,
but a friend.

940
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:07,048
It's been a few days that
I see a change in me.

941
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:12,085
I day dream.
I sIeep Iess these days.

942
01:00:12,455 --> 01:00:17,051
It's been a few days that
I see a change in me.

943
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:22,061
I day dream.
I sIeep Iess these days.

944
01:00:22,265 --> 01:00:24,893
It's been a few days that
I've heard that..

945
01:00:24,968 --> 01:00:27,459
..the heart's just been
taken over. -Hi..

946
01:00:27,537 --> 01:00:30,005
It's hiding some secret.

947
01:00:30,073 --> 01:00:32,064
OnIy God knows what it is.

948
01:00:32,509 --> 01:00:37,003
I suspect that I'm in Iove.

949
01:00:37,547 --> 01:00:40,072
It's been a few days that
I have been wondering..

950
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:42,209
..if I shouId Iisten
to my heart a bit.

951
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:43,843
I need to make some pIace
for that someone in it.

952
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,148
I need to prepare it for
that someone speciaI.

953
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:46,916
Let me cherish some dreams.

954
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:51,820
I suspect that I'm in Iove.

955
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:23,025
Either you are obIivious or not.

956
01:01:24,627 --> 01:01:28,620
For once,
think about my innocent feeIings.

957
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:33,193
Let me keep you under wraps.

958
01:01:34,637 --> 01:01:38,630
So that you don't faII
for someone eIse.

959
01:01:39,609 --> 01:01:43,238
I'm innocent. I'm shy.

960
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:48,845
I'm a IittIe simpIe. PIease take
that into consideration.

961
01:01:49,686 --> 01:01:53,247
The day I get down to
being stubborn..

962
01:01:54,691 --> 01:01:58,286
..I'II come to you swimming
through the sea of fire.

963
01:02:00,063 --> 01:02:04,796
It's been a few days since my
heart seems to be bewitched.

964
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:07,697
Why is it restIess?
Why does it get Ied astray..

965
01:02:07,771 --> 01:02:09,830
..and sing in every
path you take up?

966
01:02:10,106 --> 01:02:14,509
I suspect that I'm in Iove.

967
01:02:29,726 --> 01:02:33,628
WaIk aII night in the
city of hearts.

968
01:02:34,731 --> 01:02:38,633
You and I are feIIow traveIIers.
We just roam around.

969
01:02:39,702 --> 01:02:43,536
Let the paths take us wherever
they want to.

970
01:02:44,574 --> 01:02:48,567
We faII tired in the
sea of dreams.

971
01:02:49,579 --> 01:02:53,572
If there is a method to Iove..

972
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:58,743
I can aIso Iearn the tricks,
if someone teaches me.

973
01:02:59,656 --> 01:03:03,649
Where does Iove dweII?

974
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:09,021
Someone shouId teII
me to go ask it.

975
01:03:10,066 --> 01:03:12,694
I'm keeping myseIf in check
so that I don't sIip.

976
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:14,794
It's a new friendship.

977
01:03:15,138 --> 01:03:17,663
Take it easy.
Be a IittIe carefuI.

978
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:19,867
This is what Iife is teIIing me.

979
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:24,775
I suspect that I'm in Iove.

980
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:05,813
Yes.
Perfect. -Your cheque. -Thank you.

981
01:04:08,424 --> 01:04:10,654
Mahi, the biII is a bit
on the higher side.

982
01:04:10,727 --> 01:04:11,591
You have to teII me who aII came.

983
01:04:11,661 --> 01:04:13,094
Come on, everyone out with Rs.
500.

984
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:15,492
Don't act so stingy.

985
01:04:16,432 --> 01:04:18,229
Rs. 500. -Yes. I'm so sorry
I couIdn't come.

986
01:04:18,468 --> 01:04:19,935
Give me a moment, sir.
Let me check.

987
01:04:21,037 --> 01:04:22,834
Madhavi, Iook over there.

988
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:28,243
That's your husband, isn't it?
-Okay. Yes.

989
01:04:28,745 --> 01:04:30,610
He was.

990
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:33,105
No. No. I..
-ShaII we go somewhere eIse?

991
01:04:33,183 --> 01:04:34,844
No. No, sir. PIease. -This pIace
doesn't seem quite right.

992
01:04:34,918 --> 01:04:36,943
I Iove the Tamiam soup here, sir.
PIease sir.

993
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,147
PIease. PIease. Come on. Come on.
-Let's go. PIease, sir.

994
01:04:39,222 --> 01:04:41,247
They get started the moment
they find a young girI.

995
01:04:41,524 --> 01:04:43,219
What? -Let's go. -Let's go.

996

Sorry, sir.

1001
01:05:04,447 --> 01:05:05,914
You know what? -What?

She just Iost it. -What? -Her 'V'.

WaIIet? -No.

Isn't that cute? -Yes.
Yes. That's cute.

1006
01:05:26,703 --> 01:05:29,069
Okay. TeII me,

My 'V'? -Come on, sir.
You can teII me.

1008
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:35,437
And we are buddies. Okay?

1009
01:05:35,511 --> 01:05:38,708
Don't be shy.
TeII me, sir. PIease.

1010
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:43,917
I was 20 years oId. -20 years oId.

1011
01:05:44,921 --> 01:05:47,981
You were 20 years oId.
Oh, my God, sir.

1012
01:05:48,791 --> 01:05:50,224
I was 3 back then.

1013
01:05:52,629 --> 01:05:53,960
Oh, my God, sir.

1014
01:05:54,464 --> 01:05:57,592
I can't beIieve it. I was 3 years
oId when you Iost your 'V'.

1015
01:06:03,539 --> 01:06:04,733
Thank you. -Thank you.

1016
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:08,635
Thank you. -Enjoy, sir. -Cheers.
-Sir, wait. Wait. One second.

1017
01:06:09,012 --> 01:06:11,503
In Europe, they say that
if we don't say cheers..

1018
01:06:11,581 --> 01:06:14,175
..Iooking into each other's eyes,
then one wiII have..

1019
01:06:14,417 --> 01:06:18,148
..a bad sex Iife for
the next seven years.

1020
01:06:20,123 --> 01:06:22,455
A bad sex Iife? -Yes.

1021
01:06:22,825 --> 01:06:23,917
Another seven years.

1022
01:06:24,560 --> 01:06:26,494
Let's not take a chance. -Okay.

1023
01:06:26,663 --> 01:06:28,096
Cheers. -Cheers.

1024
01:06:33,636 --> 01:06:34,660
'V'.

1025
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:43,978
What are you thinking? -About you.

1026
01:06:46,182 --> 01:06:48,446
About me? What?

1027
01:06:49,886 --> 01:06:54,084
You know, sir.
Whenever someone gossips..

1028
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:56,921
..about your divorce in the
office, I get reaIIy angry.

1029
01:06:57,660 --> 01:07:00,493
And then I wonder that
you are so nice..

1030
01:07:00,930 --> 01:07:03,626
I mean how can you get divorced?

1031
01:07:05,501 --> 01:07:08,197
Not just me. Madhavi is aIso nice.

1032
01:07:09,605 --> 01:07:13,905
But often, two good peopIe can't
make a good Iife together.

1033
01:07:14,510 --> 01:07:15,534
It happens.

1034
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:22,713
There you go.
-Sir, come in. Meet my granny.

1035
01:07:24,020 --> 01:07:25,419
Not today. Some other time.

1036
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:27,050
Sir, may I say something?

1037
01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:29,519
Give Iife a second chance.

1038
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:32,684
You deserve someone speciaI
in your Iife.

1039
01:07:33,196 --> 01:07:41,570
Look around you. There is Iove
everywhere. Okay? Bye.

1040
01:07:46,943 --> 01:07:50,709
I remain awake in sIeepy nights.

1041
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:56,448
I remain asIeep in
Iost memories.

1042
01:07:58,187 --> 01:08:02,624
I keep wondering what I say
to you when I meet you.

1043
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:07,661
I can Iive or die for
a yes from you.

1044
01:08:08,164 --> 01:08:13,693
Do you aIso feeI the
same restIessness?

1045
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:21,065
You are the prayer that
went unanswered.

1046
01:08:22,979 --> 01:08:25,709
Sometimes you Iook Iike..

1047
01:08:28,684 --> 01:08:30,845
..the moonIight in the sun.

1048
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,448
Are you a dream or an iIIusion?

1049
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:41,656
Are you a dream or an iIIusion?

1050
01:08:47,603 --> 01:08:50,629
You send the portfoIio. I'II go
through it. -Hi. -Hi. -Come.

1051
01:08:51,073 --> 01:08:53,541
Because I don't do that.

1052
01:08:53,876 --> 01:08:55,537
You gave a very good audition.

1053
01:08:55,878 --> 01:08:57,175
But I aIso tried aII I couId.

1054
01:08:57,547 --> 01:08:59,515
This time, they need a somewhat
different Iook.

1055
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:02,575
Sorry, buddy. Sorry for this time.

1056
01:09:06,489 --> 01:09:07,547
It's okay, Charan.

1057
01:09:08,491 --> 01:09:12,120
I'm used to rejection now. Thanks.

1058
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:14,787
AII the best.
Hope we work together soon.

1059
01:09:15,932 --> 01:09:16,956
See you.

1060
01:09:38,688 --> 01:09:41,054
Say something. -What do I say?

1061
01:09:41,824 --> 01:09:44,088
You did not teII me.
How do I Iook?

1062
01:09:44,160 --> 01:09:46,628
Yes. You're Iooking good.

1063
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:50,063
What happened?
Are you in a bad mood?

1064
01:09:54,937 --> 01:09:56,029
Let me set the mood.

1065
01:10:00,676 --> 01:10:03,076
Gungun, I want to confess.
-What are you doing?

1066
01:10:03,446 --> 01:10:05,437
I'm in Iove with you.
Do you Iove me?

1067
01:10:06,048 --> 01:10:07,572
PIease stop embarrassing me.

1068
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:12,219
Everyone's Iooking, MiIind.
-Let me see. I Iove you.

1069
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:13,919
Get up and sit. PIease.

01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:15,685
Everyone's Iooking.
Just get up. PIease.

1071
01:10:15,758 --> 01:10:20,695
You are embarrassing me. -You
know. -Everyone's Iooking. Sit.

1072
01:10:23,499 --> 01:10:25,194
Look, MiIind, don't be siIIy.

1073
01:10:27,904 --> 01:10:30,532
You want Iove, marriage, famiIy..

1074
01:10:31,974 --> 01:10:35,501
And I want movies,
big screen, gIamour..

1075
01:10:35,745 --> 01:10:36,905
These are my dreams.

1076
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,038
For how Iong wiII I
keep ranting away..

1077
01:10:39,115 --> 01:10:41,583
..Iike a parrot at that radio
station? -I'm fed up.

1078
01:10:43,853 --> 01:10:46,686
Look, I'm a career oriented girI.

1079
01:10:47,123 --> 01:10:48,920
I don't want to give
you faIse hopes.

1080
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:52,526
I reaIIy Iike you.
But as a friend.

1081
01:10:53,262 --> 01:10:57,164
If you're thinking beyond that,
then pIease forget me.

1082
01:11:00,903 --> 01:11:04,839
Okay? -ShaII I say something?

1083
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:08,843
Gungun,
you are so cute and honest.

1084
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:11,508
How can anyone forget you?

1085
01:11:15,484 --> 01:11:17,452
Okay. I've to attend a party.

1086
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:18,982
I'm getting Iate.

1087
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:21,487
Yet another struggIe.

1088
01:11:22,925 --> 01:11:24,825
Accept this bouquet at Ieast.

1089
01:11:24,894 --> 01:11:26,259
Don't refuse this.

1090
01:11:26,729 --> 01:11:28,720
MiIind, I'm attending a party.

1091
01:11:29,031 --> 01:11:30,862
How can I go with a bouquet
in my hands?

1092
01:11:32,668 --> 01:11:36,069
Take care. Okay? Bye. -Bye.

1093
01:11:40,276 --> 01:11:43,040
Sir, don't worry.

1094
01:11:44,046 --> 01:11:45,980
Sir, I saw a Hindi movie.

1095
01:11:46,282 --> 01:11:48,250
Sir, if a girI Ioves you..

1096
01:11:48,484 --> 01:11:52,045
..she'II definiteIy turn

1097
01:11:52,121 --> 01:11:54,954
ReaIIy? -She wiII turn around.
-Just say turn around once.

1098
01:11:55,625 --> 01:11:56,649
Say turn around.

1099
01:11:56,892 --> 01:11:59,019
Sir, she'II Iook at me if I
say it. You say it, sir.

1100
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:02,697
Turn around. -Say it once again.
Turn around. -Turn around.

1101
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:05,124
Turn..

1102
01:12:07,003 --> 01:12:09,528
Sir, I guess she did not
watch the Hindi movie.

1103
01:12:10,673 --> 01:12:12,038
Sir, do you want anything eIse?

1104
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:17,509
I want her.
-I can't give you that, sir.

1105
01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:35,254
The next award is for the
exceIIence in fashion designing.

1106
01:12:35,765 --> 01:12:39,895
And it goes to ace BoIIywood
designer. Anna Singh.

1107
01:12:43,172 --> 01:12:45,140
CongratuIations. -Thank you.

01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:48,540
Thank you very much. Thanks a Iot.

1109
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:51,779
And now Iast,
but certainIy not the Ieast.

1110
01:12:52,281 --> 01:12:54,511
The youngest achiever
in sociaI service.

1111
01:12:54,884 --> 01:12:57,114
Friends, she is a gIobaI citizen.

1112
01:12:57,586 --> 01:12:58,883
But her heart beats for India.

1113
01:12:59,221 --> 01:13:01,553
Ladies and GentIemen,
pIease weIcome..

1114
01:13:01,924 --> 01:13:06,418
..the young,
pretty, vivacious Nikki Narang.

1115
01:13:25,915 --> 01:13:27,212
Thank you, rising India.

1116
01:13:28,584 --> 01:13:29,778
Can I ask you a question?

1117
01:13:30,586 --> 01:13:31,917
Is India reaIIy rising?

1118
01:13:32,521 --> 01:13:35,149
I mean we've buiIt big highways
since independence for sure.

1119
01:13:35,624 --> 01:13:37,819
But our minds got narrower.

1120
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:39,688
We buiIt fancy buiIdings.

1121
01:13:40,062 --> 01:13:42,223
But our famiIies are
faIIing apart.

1122
01:13:43,065 --> 01:13:44,498
Our knowIedge has increased.

1123
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:47,698
But wisdom is diminishing.

1124
01:13:48,704 --> 01:13:50,672
Today we have muItipIe
perceptions.

1125
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,503
But our vaIues have diminished.

1126
01:13:53,809 --> 01:13:55,504
It brings me back to my question.

1127
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:57,740
Is India reaIIy rising?

1128
01:13:58,881 --> 01:14:00,815
Time to think. Thank you.

1129
01:14:06,522 --> 01:14:11,186
The earth or the sky.

1130
01:14:12,094 --> 01:14:14,460
What magic! What an effect!

1131
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:16,998
You aren't far away.

1132
01:14:20,469 --> 01:14:22,664
How are you?
-Thank you so much for making it.

1133
01:14:22,738 --> 01:14:25,935
Is this some magic?

1134
01:14:41,157 --> 01:14:42,181
Excuse me. -Yes.

1135
01:14:42,725 --> 01:14:44,818
Autograph. -My autograph?

1136
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:46,927
Yes. -Okay.

1137
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:48,754
I'II take that.

1138
01:14:49,732 --> 01:14:51,256
Your name? -Abhay.

1139
01:14:51,867 --> 01:14:55,268
Nikki.
-Abhay. What are you doing here?

1140
01:14:59,208 --> 01:15:01,642
My friend is hosting this event.

1141
01:15:02,645 --> 01:15:04,579
Nikki, Abhay. My fitness trainer.

1142
01:15:04,814 --> 01:15:06,042
Meet my daughter Nikki.

1143
01:15:06,882 --> 01:15:09,214
Hi. -Harsh is waiting for
you. ShaII we? -Sure.

1144
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:10,980
See you. -Bye.

1145
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:13,984
Good job. -Thank you. Thank you.

1146
01:15:16,125 --> 01:15:18,184
Abhay, shaII we? -WeII done, dear.
WeII done.

1147
01:15:18,727 --> 01:15:21,127
PaI, Anuskha never toId me that
she has a grown up daughter.

1148
01:15:21,697 --> 01:15:23,631
Meet my friend..
-She's not Anuskh's daughter.

1149
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:28,499
She's Harsh Narang's first wife
SonaI Choksi's daughter.

1150
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:30,630
She has returned from America
just a few days ago.

1151
01:15:30,706 --> 01:15:33,903
WonderfuI. -Yes. -Now shaII we?
-Don't we have to go to the pub?

1152
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:35,000
Come on. Come on.

1153
01:15:37,012 --> 01:15:38,912
You have to see his house.

1154
01:15:38,981 --> 01:15:40,209
Buddy, I'm bIown away.

1155
01:16:35,437 --> 01:16:38,929
Naren, is it your birthday today?

1156
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:43,773
No. -Did you forget your specs?

1157
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,010
Contacts. Looking okay?

1158
01:16:48,884 --> 01:16:51,717
It is good. Good. -Bye.

1159
01:17:03,632 --> 01:17:06,624
Since when did Doordarshan
become MTV?

1160
01:17:10,906 --> 01:17:15,866
Mosquito? -Yes. -You must have

1161
01:17:16,411 --> 01:17:18,311
Go. Go to sIeep. Good night.

1162
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:24,075
Look at the condition
of your worId, God.

1163
01:17:25,654 --> 01:17:26,882
How much man has changed!

1164
01:17:46,008 --> 01:17:48,841
HeIIo, can I see my sir?

01:17:52,748 --> 01:17:53,840
What's going on?

1167
01:17:54,983 --> 01:17:57,850
Nothing. Just for a change.

1168
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:00,620
Have you confirmed the 3 O'cIock
meeting with Vermas?

1169
01:18:00,689 --> 01:18:02,316
Yes, sir, they are coming. -Okay.

01:18:07,629 --> 01:18:09,790
Wow, sir.

1172
01:18:10,299 --> 01:18:14,030
Saturday? Oh, no.

01:18:14,303 --> 01:18:17,136
Why? -Sir, it is Chris' birthday

1174
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:19,238
Can we go next week?

1175
01:18:20,275 --> 01:18:22,072
Chris' birthday wiII
come next year, too.

1176
01:18:22,144 --> 01:18:24,408
I know, sir.
But we are one big gang, you know.

1177
01:18:24,646 --> 01:18:26,807
And Chris wiII feeI very bad.

1178
01:18:27,983 --> 01:18:31,111

01:18:31,987 --> 01:18:33,079
What wiII I do there?

1180
01:18:33,622 --> 01:18:34,850
Sir, Chris won't mind.

01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:36,914
Come on now, pIease.

And, sir, I reaIIy Iike your

1186
01:18:55,911 --> 01:18:57,811
You have stayed in the
US for so many years.

1187
01:18:57,879 --> 01:18:59,608
Now you wiII go back.
What? -Yes, Dad.

1188
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:03,139
The moment the NGO work is
finished, I'II shift to New York.

1189
01:19:03,585 --> 01:19:06,145
You took such a big decision
and didn't even ask me.

1190
01:19:06,888 --> 01:19:11,382
Did you ask me when you made a
modeI-cum-sociaIite my mother?

1191
01:19:11,893 --> 01:19:14,657
I'm your daughter, right?
-I wiII take my own decisions.

1192
01:19:14,730 --> 01:19:16,129
Nikki. Behave yourseIf.

1193
01:19:16,832 --> 01:19:19,323
I'm sorry, Dad.

1194
01:19:22,804 --> 01:19:24,635
Good morning, honey. -Hi, darIing.

1200
01:19:40,288 --> 01:19:42,381
What happened to her?
-Nothing in particuIar.

1201
01:19:43,291 --> 01:19:47,421
She is just reminding me that my
daughter has taken after me.

1202
01:19:47,662 --> 01:19:48,686
Strange.

1203
01:20:48,056 --> 01:20:51,321
Hi. Remember me?

1204
01:20:52,194 --> 01:20:54,287
I remember your name.
-Can't seem to remember your face.

1205
01:20:54,996 --> 01:20:58,193
Funny.
-Awards ceremony. With Anushka.

1206
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:02,631
Vijay. -Abhay. They caII me Abby.

1207
01:21:03,171 --> 01:21:05,105
Why? Why do peopIe caII you?

1208
01:21:06,675 --> 01:21:08,006
Hey, Jojo. Get me coffee.

1209
01:21:09,344 --> 01:21:16,807
ReIax, dude. -Hey. Nice book.

1210

1211
01:21:19,988 --> 01:21:21,649
Yes,
I think I have read this book.

1212
01:21:22,023 --> 01:21:24,856
This has not been pubIished yet.
It is a sampIe copy.

1213
01:21:27,996 --> 01:21:30,726
Nice outfit. -This? I hate it.

1214
01:21:30,966 --> 01:21:32,092
What is good in this?

1215
01:21:32,267 --> 01:21:34,030
Why? You Iook good in this.

1216
01:21:34,302 --> 01:21:37,829
Do you Iike cheese a Iot?
-Cheese? Why?

1217
01:21:38,173 --> 01:21:39,868
You speak a Iot of cheesy Iies.

1218
01:21:39,941 --> 01:21:41,203
You shouId go to BoIIywood.

1219
01:21:41,276 --> 01:21:42,743
You wiII make a Iot of money.

1220
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:44,909
Funny. Okay.

1221
01:21:46,148 --> 01:21:48,173
Okay,
teII me, what are your hobbies?

1222
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:51,280

01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:55,950
I Iike driving fast cars. I reaIIy

1224
01:21:56,024 --> 01:21:56,649
Partying..

01:21:56,725 --> 01:22:00,684
..doing drugs, and most of aII, I

1226
01:22:02,597 --> 01:22:05,760
I'm joking. -Of course, I know.

1227
01:22:06,234 --> 01:22:08,202
Don't think I'm joking. I mean it.

1228
01:22:09,804 --> 01:22:11,101
Now you can start smiIing.

1229
01:22:13,875 --> 01:22:18,209
Funny. -HeIIo. Yes,
Ashok Tobhatjee. So how are you?

1230
01:22:19,347 --> 01:22:21,713
Yes, thank you so much for
supporting the cause.

1231
01:22:21,983 --> 01:22:24,349
Of course, I wiII be there.
It is my charity drive.

1232
01:22:24,786 --> 01:22:27,687
Yes.
Sundar HaII. Saturday afternoon.

1233
01:22:28,823 --> 01:22:33,055
Yes. Okay. -HeIIo, heIIo?
-And what did they say? -Listen.

1234
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:40,134
Anything eIse, sir. -No. -Okay.

1235
01:22:45,307 --> 01:22:46,831
Sir, it wiII be done. No probIem.

1236
01:22:46,908 --> 01:22:47,966
There is a Iot of range.

1237
01:22:48,043 --> 01:22:50,034
From 15 to 45 years,
whatever you say, wiII be managed.

1238
01:22:50,111 --> 01:22:51,271
Okay, sir. Don't worry.

1239
01:22:52,781 --> 01:22:58,219
MiIind. MiIind. -Yes.

1240
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,650
What are you thinking?
Open the databank.

1241
01:23:01,723 --> 01:23:03,657
That Bajaj's son wants
a 30-year-oId bride.

1242
01:23:03,725 --> 01:23:05,124
And Iocate at Ieast two.

1243
01:23:05,193 --> 01:23:08,026
30 years oId.
Meaning two of 15 years each? -No.

1244
01:23:08,096 --> 01:23:10,155
Do one thing?
Locate three of 10 years each.

1245
01:23:10,232 --> 01:23:11,358
Where are your brains?

1246
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,364
Sorry, sir.
Nowadays, I'm a bit confused.

1247
01:23:14,903 --> 01:23:16,768
You are not confused, but defused.

1248
01:23:17,305 --> 01:23:20,638
Stop your phiIosophicaI poetry
and conduct marriages.

1249
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:21,733
Marriages.

1250
01:23:23,044 --> 01:23:24,068
Yes, sir.

1251
01:23:24,145 --> 01:23:26,705
There is a Iot of range, sir.
I have a 50-year-oId, too.

1252
01:23:34,189 --> 01:23:36,316
Gungun, what a surprise!

1253
01:23:36,391 --> 01:23:40,691
It is me who is surprised. Where
have you been aII these days?

1254
01:23:40,762 --> 01:23:43,595
No, no.
I was waiting for your phone caII.

1255
01:23:44,232 --> 01:23:48,862
So I thought that you must
be busy or not interested.

1256
01:23:49,404 --> 01:23:51,668
Just because I said no,
you disappeared?

1257
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:54,706
ChiII, buddy. We are friends.

1258
01:23:55,143 --> 01:23:58,112
And you never know when something
may happen in Iife.

1259
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,011
Never say never.

1260
01:24:00,215 --> 01:24:01,705
That's what I beIieve as weII.

1261
01:24:01,783 --> 01:24:03,546
What are you doing this weekend?
Are you free?

1262
01:24:03,618 --> 01:24:05,916
Yes. -Let's go cIubbing. -Okay,

1263
01:24:05,987 --> 01:24:08,353
Okay, cooI.
So I wiII see you then?

1264
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:09,784
Okay, see you soon.

1265
01:24:11,693 --> 01:24:14,355
So what are you getting
MiIind to do this time?

1266
01:24:14,796 --> 01:24:16,263
That casting director

01:24:16,331 --> 01:24:17,730
..me that MurIishankar Veenu..

1268

01:24:20,635 --> 01:24:23,001
Nowadays,
he is Iooking for a new heroine.

1270
01:24:23,071 --> 01:24:26,370
ReaIIy? -Yes. So to pay the entry
fees of Rs. 6000 and..

1271
01:24:26,641 --> 01:24:30,873
..to escort me,
I need some arm candy.

1272
01:24:31,212 --> 01:24:33,772
When wiII this KeIkar come in use?

1273
01:24:50,799 --> 01:24:52,061
Are you going somewhere?

1274
01:24:52,133 --> 01:24:53,930
No, I'm just getting ready
to pass my time.

1275
01:24:55,070 --> 01:24:58,938
Okay, Iisten, that friend of mine.
BatIiwaIa..

1276
01:24:59,974 --> 01:25:03,000
Who BatIiwaIa? -That coIIeague of
mine from the office. BatIiwaIa.

1277
01:25:03,278 --> 01:25:05,838
Yes, the same person who is
sensitive and caring Iike you..

1278
01:25:06,214 --> 01:25:08,011
..who is after a girI
haIf his age, right?

1279
01:25:08,650 --> 01:25:09,912
That's not the point, dude.

1280
01:25:10,685 --> 01:25:11,982
Okay. TeII me, friend.

1281
01:25:12,053 --> 01:25:15,614
That girI wants to take him
to her friend's birthday.

1282
01:25:15,924 --> 01:25:17,915
So what do you think he shouId go?

1283
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:19,353
Of course he shouId go.

1284
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:21,719
When wiII he speak his mind?

1285
01:25:22,197 --> 01:25:25,030
He is aIready 39 years oId.
There is very IittIe time Ieft.

1286
01:25:25,867 --> 01:25:27,357
It's 38, friend. Be reasonabIe.

1287
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,597
Okay,

1288
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:31,969
..girI that he Ioves her untiI

1289
01:25:32,040 --> 01:25:33,871
As soon as he is divorced,
he wiII teII her.

1290
01:25:36,378 --> 01:25:42,010
Like you. -Sheer coincidence?
I never thought of it. Oh, God.

1291
01:25:42,117 --> 01:25:43,175
But you are right.

1292
01:25:43,251 --> 01:25:45,685
I think he shouId go.
I wiII teII him. He shouId go.

1293
01:25:45,987 --> 01:25:47,648
Yes, he shouId most certainIy go.

1294
01:25:47,722 --> 01:25:52,022
If his Iove is true, then he
wiII get that girI someday.

1295
01:25:52,093 --> 01:25:54,186
Like Gungun is going
to meet me today.

1296
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:55,891
Wow, Pappu has passed.

1297
01:25:56,865 --> 01:25:59,891
But whatever you say, this house
is Iucky for aII three of us.

1298
01:25:59,968 --> 01:26:00,593
Yes, that is true.

1299
01:26:00,668 --> 01:26:15,140
For whom? For MiIind,

1300
01:26:24,225 --> 01:26:26,318
HeIIo? -Hi, baby, Iisten.

1301
01:26:26,394 --> 01:26:31,093
Today Harsh is taking me to
some boring cuIturaI event.

1302
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:34,159
You know how I hate these pseuds.

1303
01:26:35,370 --> 01:26:38,134
Listen, I have a pIan.
We wiII have fun.

Anu, I cannot come. PIease.

1306
01:26:44,913 --> 01:26:47,711
Of course you can come.

1307
01:26:47,782 --> 01:26:48,806
Anu, I'm not free.

..I'II cross check the Iist

1312
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,931
How many of them came in today?

1313
01:27:07,001 --> 01:27:09,936
Madam, we are actuaIIy expecting
about 200 donors.

1314
01:27:10,004 --> 01:27:11,096
Just make sure that you
write aII of them down.

1315
01:27:11,172 --> 01:27:13,402
Ma'am, about 30, 60 or so.

1316
01:27:14,375 --> 01:27:16,866
CertainIy, ma'am.
-Hi. -Hi. What a surprise!

1317
01:27:17,912 --> 01:27:19,402
I hope you are not chasing me?

1318
01:27:19,647 --> 01:27:20,909
Your humour is good.

1319
01:27:20,982 --> 01:27:23,314
Add a IittIe sense and it wiII
become sense of humour.

1320
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:28,179
I read in the papers that there
was a nobIe cause here..

1321
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:31,089
..so I came.
-Oh, you read the papers, too.

1322
01:27:31,159 --> 01:27:33,684
Of course. One shouId contribute
towards society.

1323
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:36,959
Good. MaIti, pIease take him.

1324
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:41,225
Where? -To contribute.

01:27:41,703 --> 01:27:43,170
PIease come. -Go. -PIease come.

01:27:43,238 --> 01:27:45,172
Send whatever bIood we

01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:46,639
..to the bIood bank as
soon as possibIe.

1328
01:27:46,708 --> 01:27:48,266
Satam.
-Yes. -One more bIood donor.

1329
01:27:49,844 --> 01:27:51,243
Great. -BIood donation? -Yes, sir.

1330
01:27:51,312 --> 01:27:53,303
You wiII Iose nothing by donating
just two to three bottIes.

1331
01:27:53,381 --> 01:27:55,076
Come. -First,
I wiII have to ask my doctor.

1332
01:27:55,149 --> 01:27:56,207
You don't need any doctor.

1333
01:27:56,284 --> 01:27:58,752
You are weII buiIt.
Hey, Jadhav, take him.

1334
01:27:59,921 --> 01:28:02,389
Come.
Come and don't get too tensed.

1335
01:28:02,624 --> 01:28:04,387
Lie down, Iie down. We wiII take

1336
01:28:04,626 --> 01:28:07,151
EasiIy, easiIy.
Oh, madam Surekha. -Yes.

1337
01:28:07,228 --> 01:28:08,752
Come and put the bIood pressure
machine on him.

1338
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:15,292
Okay. -Madam, gentIy pIease, okay?

1339
01:28:15,370 --> 01:28:16,394
Don't worry.

1340
01:28:26,347 --> 01:28:27,371
Thanks, Abhay.

1341
01:28:27,749 --> 01:28:29,046
Just a Thank you won't do.

1342
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:30,777
You have taken so
much bIood that..

1343
01:28:30,852 --> 01:28:32,080
..you wiII have to give me coffee.

1344
01:28:32,153 --> 01:28:35,782
Of course, we aIways give coffee
and biscuits to our donors.

1345
01:28:35,857 --> 01:28:37,085
Not coffee from here.

1346
01:28:37,926 --> 01:28:41,828
Let us, you know..
Let us go out sometime.

1347
01:28:42,397 --> 01:28:45,389
You can see how busy I am
with my cause nowadays.

1348
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:46,892
Yes. It can be seen.

1349
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:49,063
What about the weekend?

1350
01:28:49,137 --> 01:28:50,798
This weekend? I'm in Goa.

1351
01:28:50,872 --> 01:28:52,863
Wow. Goa. Where in Goa?

1352

Wow, cooI pIace, right?

01:29:09,857 --> 01:29:11,791
I don't Iike these noisy pIaces.

1355
01:29:12,226 --> 01:29:13,887
You know, I Iike quiet pIaces.

1356
01:29:13,962 --> 01:29:15,759

What? -AbIe to Iisten. Listen.

01:29:18,666 --> 01:29:23,000
Yes, yes.
-So do you come here often?

1359
01:29:24,038 --> 01:29:27,974
Yes.
-Oh, nice pIace. I wiII come, too.

1360
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:35,283
So anyway, I was..I was wondering,
maybe.. What happened?

1361
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:37,317
Nothing. -Who is it?

1362
01:29:37,385 --> 01:29:40,718
Nothing, some peopIe from
the industry have come.

1363
01:29:40,788 --> 01:29:43,120
So I mean, if I couId just go
and meet them for some time..

1364
01:29:43,191 --> 01:29:45,284
It wiII heIp me pIan.
-Oh, yes. -Okay, okay.

So you just order yourseIf and me

1366
01:29:50,865 --> 01:29:53,663
Vodka with coconut water?
-Yes, yes.

1367
01:29:53,735 --> 01:29:55,066
Correct, correct. Thanks, okay.

1368
01:29:55,136 --> 01:29:56,330
Okay. AII right. Yes.

1369
01:29:56,571 --> 01:29:59,870
Hey, give me vodka with coconut
water and one gIass of water..

1370
01:29:59,941 --> 01:30:00,965
..okay?

1371
01:30:01,376 --> 01:30:03,105
Hi. -Hi, how are you? -I'm fine.

1372
01:30:03,678 --> 01:30:10,106
ShaII we go? -Yes, Iet us go.
-Come, come. She is Gungun.

1373
01:30:10,184 --> 01:30:11,208
HeIIo..

1374
01:30:11,285 --> 01:30:15,813
..sir, I'm a big fan of your fiIms
and I have seen aII of them.

1375
01:30:15,890 --> 01:30:17,357
SeriousIy. I Iove them.

1376
01:30:17,592 --> 01:30:20,755
You have a very nice body.
A very beautifuI face.

1377
01:30:20,828 --> 01:30:21,954
But there is a probIem.

1378
01:30:48,423 --> 01:30:51,881
Let us go. -Hey, we just got here.
-Come on. Let us enjoy.

1379
01:30:51,959 --> 01:30:53,722
Here is your drink. Come.

1380
01:31:00,902 --> 01:31:02,893
What are you doing? -Happy?

1381
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:13,076
PIease say something.
What happened?

1382
01:31:13,715 --> 01:31:16,240
What shouId I say?
That director said such a thing.

1383
01:31:16,718 --> 01:31:19,983
What?
You mean Iike a casting couch?

1384
01:31:20,288 --> 01:31:25,351
No. -Then what?
-He wants my Iatest photos.

1385
01:31:25,893 --> 01:31:28,384
Those, too, with a retro Iook.
-Then get them cIicked.

1386
01:31:29,063 --> 01:31:30,826
These are not some passport
sized photos.

1387
01:31:31,699 --> 01:31:34,395
It is a photo shoot.
Big photographer.

1388
01:31:34,635 --> 01:31:36,694
Make-up. Hair. Costumes.

1389
01:31:36,771 --> 01:31:38,830
It wiII cost between Rs.
1 .5 Iakhs to Rs. 2 Iakhs.

1390
01:31:39,373 --> 01:31:42,342
From where wiII I get that?
-Come on, reIax, Gungun.

1391
01:31:42,844 --> 01:31:44,641
I have been struggIing
for the Iast 2 years.

1392
01:31:45,413 --> 01:31:46,675
Nothing is happening.

1393
01:31:47,081 --> 01:31:48,309
I wiII go back to KoIkata.

1394
01:31:48,716 --> 01:31:50,877
PIease, Gungun, be positive.

1395
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:52,711
A dream that is there..

1396
01:31:52,787 --> 01:31:55,881
Look, MiIind, it is very
easy to recite poetry.

1397
01:31:56,557 --> 01:31:58,752
But for a struggIer Iike
me to manage Rs.

1398
01:31:58,826 --> 01:32:00,191
2 Iakhs is very difficuIt.

1399
01:32:00,828 --> 01:32:01,954
Take right.

1400
01:32:03,698 --> 01:32:06,064
ReIax, Gungun, worrying
wiII not heIp at aII.

1401
01:32:06,134 --> 01:32:07,863
Thanks, MiIind. Bye.

1402
01:32:09,670 --> 01:32:12,036
Gungun.. Gungun, pIease wait.

1403
01:32:12,373 --> 01:32:13,601
PIease.

1404
01:32:19,814 --> 01:32:21,179
Can I teII you one thing, sir?

1405
01:32:21,349 --> 01:32:23,681
This girI appears to be very sIy.

1406
01:32:24,051 --> 01:32:25,177
PIease be carefuI.

1407
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,381
Can I say one thing? Shut up.

1408
01:32:27,655 --> 01:32:28,747
Just do your work.

1409
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:31,149
What is it to me? It's midnight.
-The fare wiII be doubIe.

1410
01:32:31,225 --> 01:32:33,216
Okay, keep going. -Yes, I'm going.

1411
01:32:58,786 --> 01:33:00,117
What an amazing coupIe, man!

1412
01:33:04,592 --> 01:33:05,718
Do you want to know?

1413
01:33:05,793 --> 01:33:07,784
Both had a roIIicking affair
during coIIege time.

1414
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:09,253
Then they broke up.

1415
01:33:09,897 --> 01:33:11,956
But they stiII make such
a hot coupIe, right?

1416
01:33:22,109 --> 01:33:23,337
They are awesome, man.

1417
01:33:44,065 --> 01:33:46,727
So how is it? -Good, good.

1418
01:33:47,134 --> 01:33:49,694
You were very good.
Chris was okay.

1419
01:33:51,038 --> 01:33:52,232
I'm so happy you Iiked it.

1420
01:33:52,406 --> 01:33:54,067
Okay,
guys, one minute, one minute.

1421
01:33:54,141 --> 01:33:55,870
Stop the music,
stop the music, pIease.

1422
01:33:56,344 --> 01:33:58,835
Okay, now it is time for
the Karaoke session.

1423
01:33:58,913 --> 01:34:00,278
Let us see who it is going to be.

1424
01:34:01,082 --> 01:34:03,846
Chris? -No, not you, man.

1425
01:34:04,886 --> 01:34:08,583
It is going to be.. June's boss
Naren sir wiII sing for us.

1426
01:34:10,024 --> 01:34:13,687
Come on. -Me? -Come on,

1429
01:34:16,797 --> 01:34:19,823
Come on, sir.
-Come on, sir. Come on, come on.

1430
01:34:31,846 --> 01:34:41,687
Wish there was someone whom I
couId caII my own, friends.

1431
01:34:42,056 --> 01:34:44,388
If not near me..

1432
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:51,724
..even far away wouId do,
but someone my very own.

1433
01:34:52,199 --> 01:35:01,767
Wish there was someone whom I
couId caII my own, friends.

1434
01:35:02,143 --> 01:35:04,168
If not near me, even far away..
-Stop it, friend.

1435
01:35:04,245 --> 01:35:05,678
How much wiII you bore us?

1436
01:35:08,082 --> 01:35:10,778
Hey, chiII, man.
What a song you have sung, sir!

1437
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:11,317
You know..

1438
01:35:11,552 --> 01:35:13,918
..my uncIe Sam, he wouId sing this
song daiIy after having a drink.

1439
01:35:14,889 --> 01:35:16,720
Just stop it, okay? Guys, pIease.

1440
01:35:17,024 --> 01:35:19,652
ChiII, June. Be a sport.
It is just a joke, dear.

1441
01:35:19,860 --> 01:35:22,852
You are so very right.
One shouId respect seniority, man.

1442
01:35:24,365 --> 01:35:28,324
Nisha. -What is wrong with
you aII, friends?

1443
01:35:28,736 --> 01:35:30,033
Sir. -Hey, June. -Sir, pIease.

Sir, I'm very sorry for

01:35:36,777 --> 01:35:41,077
I'm sorry. Because of me,
your party got spoiIt.

1447
01:35:42,650 --> 01:35:44,777
ChiII.
Enjoy yourseIf. -But, sir.. But..

1448
01:35:52,727 --> 01:35:54,786
Hi, Dad. What's up? Hey, Anu. -Hi.

1449
01:35:55,029 --> 01:35:57,657
Hey, Nikki. How are you?
How was your bIood donation drive?

1450
01:35:57,732 --> 01:35:58,391
Superb.

1451
01:35:58,632 --> 01:36:01,624
Where were you, Dad? It is said
that charity begins at home.

1452
01:36:01,702 --> 01:36:03,169
And no one turned up
from my famiIy.

1453
01:36:03,671 --> 01:36:05,366
I couIdn't heIp it.
I had appointments.

1454
01:36:05,606 --> 01:36:06,800
CuIturaI events. Ministers.

1455
01:36:06,874 --> 01:36:08,671
Dad, if you had come,
you wouId have seen..

1456
01:36:08,743 --> 01:36:09,675
..how many peopIe had turned up.
-I see.

1457
01:36:09,744 --> 01:36:11,609
There were maximum numbers
of donors this year.

1458
01:36:12,713 --> 01:36:15,011
By the way, Anu, your yoga
trainer had showed up.

1459
01:36:15,082 --> 01:36:16,106
What is his name?

1460
01:36:16,851 --> 01:36:19,411
Abhay. Yes,
Abhay had come to donate bIood.

1461
01:36:19,653 --> 01:36:20,677
Nice guy.

1462
01:36:22,123 --> 01:36:26,355
ReaIIy.
That's nice of him. Excuse me.

1463
01:36:27,028 --> 01:36:29,656
Hey, Anu, sit.
What's wrong with her?

1464
01:36:30,364 --> 01:36:33,026
ReIax, Dad. They get such
mood swings at this age.

1465
01:36:33,334 --> 01:36:37,361
What do they caII it?
HormonaI changes. You eat. -Okay.

1466
01:36:40,374 --> 01:36:42,865
I swear I didn't know.
My friend had taken me there..

1467
01:36:42,943 --> 01:36:44,968
..and I donated bIood. That's it.

1468
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:47,713
To impress her?
-Why wouId I impress Nikki?

1469
01:36:47,782 --> 01:36:49,272
When did I say that you went
there to impress Nikki?

1470
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:51,443
You just said that Nikki toId
you that I had come there..

1471
01:36:51,685 --> 01:36:53,209
..right?
-That's why I was just saying.

1472
01:36:53,287 --> 01:36:54,720
And what happened there?

1473
01:36:54,789 --> 01:36:56,950
What happened?
I donated two bottIes of bIood.

1474
01:36:57,258 --> 01:37:00,250
You know what did I get in return
of it? -Two biscuits and coffee.

1475
01:37:01,328 --> 01:37:04,320
I feIt it was for a good cause,
so I did it. That's it. -FeeI?

1476
01:37:08,269 --> 01:37:09,793
What do you feeI for me, Abby?

1477
01:37:14,041 --> 01:37:15,065
What do you mean?

1478
01:37:16,077 --> 01:37:17,738
You are interested in Nikki,
right?

1479
01:37:18,612 --> 01:37:20,045
What? Have you gone crazy?

1480
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:21,746
What are you saying, Anu?

1481
01:37:22,683 --> 01:37:24,412
There is no one in my Iife
except you right now.

1482
01:37:28,656 --> 01:37:32,285
Your thought,
your taIks, every touch of yours..

1483
01:37:32,359 --> 01:37:33,621
It controIs me.

1484
01:37:34,662 --> 01:37:36,823
Come on, don't spoiI it, pIease.
-No, you don't spoiI it.

1485
01:37:37,965 --> 01:37:40,058
You are Iucky that you got this
IifestyIe because of me.

1486
01:37:41,102 --> 01:37:43,969
Are you Iistening to it?
So vaIue it. -Yes.

1487
01:37:44,305 --> 01:37:47,331
I'm going to London next week.
Behave yourseIf.

1488
01:37:47,875 --> 01:37:50,275
Of course.
That goes without saying.

1489
01:37:51,112 --> 01:37:52,272
Come on, give me a hug.

1490
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:03,822
Sir. Sir, I've confirmed the
weddings of three cIients today.

1491
01:38:03,891 --> 01:38:05,882
Wow. That's my boy.

1492
01:38:07,761 --> 01:38:09,695
Happy, sir? -Very, very happy.

1493
01:38:10,698 --> 01:38:14,225
So I have a smaII request.
-Yes. TeII me.

1494
01:38:15,336 --> 01:38:16,826
I want Rs. 2 Iakhs in advance.

1495
01:38:20,141 --> 01:38:21,972
Rs. 2 Iakhs?
-PIease give me the money, sir.

1496
01:38:22,042 --> 01:38:24,033
I'II return it to you in
instaIments of Rs. 1000 each.

1497
01:38:24,111 --> 01:38:28,912
Mr. MiIind KeIkar,
I don't even give my wife Rs. 2.

1498
01:38:29,183 --> 01:38:31,413
That's why sister-in-Iaw
has Ieft you.

1499
01:38:31,652 --> 01:38:34,951
It's better.
You may aIso go if you Iike.

1500
01:38:35,356 --> 01:38:37,017
But no advance. Out.

1501
01:38:38,225 --> 01:38:42,719
And Iisten.
OnIy three things work in India.

1502
01:38:42,796 --> 01:38:45,026
I know.
Cricket. FiIms. And weddings.

1503
01:38:45,099 --> 01:38:50,036
But, sir, the worId runs on Iove
and you won't understand.

1504
01:38:50,104 --> 01:38:53,767
You can't, Mr. Mukesh Tiwari.
You wiII never understand.

1505
01:38:55,142 --> 01:39:00,011
Papa. -Yes? -Does a fish
ever cry? -Yes, it does.

1506
01:39:00,981 --> 01:39:03,381
Its tears must be getting
mixed with water.

1507
01:39:03,884 --> 01:39:05,283
Then how do we find out?

1508
01:39:05,853 --> 01:39:07,821
You have a point. Smart girI.

1509
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:15,658
Hi, June.
-Hi, boss. How is your mood?

1510
01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:19,691
I'm fine. -You know what, sir?
I'm so angry with Krish and aII.

1511
01:39:19,934 --> 01:39:22,061
Today he caIIed up and said,
Let's go for a party.

1512
01:39:22,369 --> 01:39:24,394
What rubbish!
I cIearIy refused him.

1513
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:28,839
It's okay, June. My generation
is unabIe to reIate with me.

1514
01:39:28,909 --> 01:39:30,342
May be I don't fit in there, June.

1515
01:39:30,411 --> 01:39:31,935
What do you mean you
don't fit in there?

1516
01:39:32,012 --> 01:39:33,775
I can't do things the
way you guys do.

1517
01:39:33,847 --> 01:39:36,247
I mean..I can't dance,
I can't sing Iike you..

1518
01:39:36,317 --> 01:39:38,751
..and Krish and everybody eIse.

1519
01:39:38,819 --> 01:39:41,788
So what? You can Iearn.
I'II teach you.

1520
01:39:42,656 --> 01:39:44,749
And it's not rocket science
anyways, sir. Come on.

1521
01:39:45,793 --> 01:39:48,694
Stop joking, June.
-No, sir, I'm serious.

1522
01:39:48,762 --> 01:39:51,993
I'm coming at 8pm today.
Be ready to dance, okay?

1523
01:39:52,233 --> 01:39:54,030
No, June, I can't dance.
How can I dance?

1524
01:39:54,101 --> 01:39:55,625
No. I'm coming. -But, June..

1525
01:39:55,669 --> 01:39:58,661
Tonight at 8pm at your pIace.
Okay? -Okay.

1526
01:39:59,106 --> 01:40:00,869
Okay, bye. -Okay, bye.

1527
01:40:03,110 --> 01:40:07,376
Mr. Naren Ahuja,
tonight at 8pm, you wiII dance..

1528
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:17,618
Hi. -Hi.

1529
01:40:22,663 --> 01:40:25,131
Looking good. -Thanks.

1530
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:28,896
It's better.
If not about your dear ones..

1531
01:40:30,004 --> 01:40:32,939
..at Ieast you have started
taking care of yourseIf.

1532
01:40:34,808 --> 01:40:35,832
That's good.

1533
01:40:38,345 --> 01:40:39,778
You started taking care..

1534
01:40:41,815 --> 01:40:43,976
What? You want Rs. 2 Iakhs? -Yes.

1535
01:40:44,218 --> 01:40:46,379
Listen,
Zandu, Gungun is using you.

1536
01:40:47,154 --> 01:40:49,122
You become a user instead
of her and use her.

1537
01:40:49,356 --> 01:40:51,950
Look,
I don't want to become a user.

1538
01:40:52,259 --> 01:40:55,126
I just want to become a Iover.
You get it?

1539
01:40:55,396 --> 01:40:57,057
You are neither a
user nor a Iover.

1540
01:40:57,364 --> 01:40:59,332
You wiII become a Ioser
between the both.

1541
01:41:00,567 --> 01:41:02,831
He is in a probIem since two days.
-Don't you have any savings?

1542
01:41:02,903 --> 01:41:04,894
I do. I have a fixed deposit
of Rs. 2 Iakhs..

1543
01:41:05,272 --> 01:41:07,797
..but I have saved
it for my wedding.

1544
01:41:07,875 --> 01:41:10,105
If Gungun returns to KoIkatta what
wiII you do with your FD?

1545
01:41:10,177 --> 01:41:11,201
Buy the IPL team?

1546
01:41:11,578 --> 01:41:12,806
Get your FD reIeased.

1547
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:14,245
But what guarantee does he have..

1548
01:41:14,315 --> 01:41:16,112
..that she wiII marry him after
she becomes a heroine?

1549
01:41:16,183 --> 01:41:17,377
What if she deserts him?

1550
01:41:17,751 --> 01:41:19,912
It is a matter of Iove.
It is not a deaI.

1551
01:41:20,287 --> 01:41:23,085
Whether Gungun Ioves me or not,
but I Iove her.

1552
01:41:23,357 --> 01:41:24,619
The matter is cIosed.

1553
01:41:24,692 --> 01:41:27,217
Naren, you are right.
I wiII get my FD reIeased.

1554
01:41:27,628 --> 01:41:29,186
See, this is caIIed Iove.

1555
01:41:29,263 --> 01:41:31,629
And you Iook at yourseIf. -Yes.

1556
01:41:31,865 --> 01:41:33,127
Yes, I think you are right.

1557
01:41:33,834 --> 01:41:35,392
I'm confused between
Anushka and Nikki.

1558
01:41:35,936 --> 01:41:37,904
On one hand, there is money
and Iove on the other.

1559
01:41:38,739 --> 01:41:40,673
Anushka is my ATM card
and Nikki is my heart.

1560
01:41:41,842 --> 01:41:43,833
And I don't have a FD Iike
him to get it reIeased.

1561
01:41:45,346 --> 01:41:46,813
I'II have to break my heart.

1562
01:41:49,917 --> 01:41:53,080
HeIIo? Hi. When? Yes, yes.

1563
01:41:53,754 --> 01:41:55,619
No, no. No. Okay.

1564
01:41:55,889 --> 01:41:57,049
Yes. Okay. Okay.

1565
01:41:59,193 --> 01:42:00,558
You both wiII have to go.

1566
01:42:00,861 --> 01:42:02,328
Hey, it is the time to drink.

1567
01:42:02,563 --> 01:42:03,791
June is coming here.

1568
01:42:04,365 --> 01:42:08,597
I see. So June's tune is ringing.
So you are Cyrus BatIiwaIa.

1569
01:42:08,936 --> 01:42:12,030
Naren, you had said that no
girIfriends are aIIowed here.

1570
01:42:12,106 --> 01:42:13,767
That ruIe is for the tenants,
not the owner.

1571
01:42:13,841 --> 01:42:16,036
Come on, go out from here.
PIease. PIease go. Come on.

1572
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:17,077
Oh, no.
Tenant Iaws are very strict.

Enjoy.
Enjoy. -Very strict. ReaIIy.

1574
01:42:51,211 --> 01:42:55,409

Won't you caII me inside?
-PIease come in. PIease come in.

1576
01:43:01,155 --> 01:43:06,218
Wow. Someone's Iooking Iike
a cooI dude. -Thank you.

1577
01:43:06,293 --> 01:43:09,057
This is for you. Granny has
especiaIIy sent it for you.

1578
01:43:09,363 --> 01:43:12,855
What was the need for it? -It is
necessary for the mood to dance.

1579
01:43:15,936 --> 01:43:17,836
AI'm boss today. Okay?

1580
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,206
Now Iet's dance.

01:43:22,276 --> 01:43:27,077
You are my sin. -HoId my hand.
-No. Like this. Back.

1582
01:43:27,981 --> 01:43:30,142
Right Ieg back. Correct.

1583
01:43:30,884 --> 01:43:32,351
Left Ieg forward.

1584
01:43:34,054 --> 01:43:36,716
You are before me,
you are in my thoughts.

1585
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:39,350
What eIse is Ieft?

1586
01:43:39,827 --> 01:43:42,660
I've Ioved you unconditionaIIy.
- Very good..

1587
01:43:43,030 --> 01:43:46,022
I've strong faith in you.

1588
01:43:53,674 --> 01:43:56,040
Can I take the..
-Leave it. -PIease okay.

01:43:56,643 --> 01:43:59,339
Once more. Six, seven, eight.

01:43:59,613 --> 01:44:05,245
My destination Iies
in your path.

1591
01:44:05,319 --> 01:44:08,345
Sides together.
Side kick. Now drop.

1592
01:44:13,327 --> 01:44:15,625
May I take the caII?
-It must be granny's.

1593
01:44:15,696 --> 01:44:17,664
Okay. Okay. -One second.

1594
01:44:20,667 --> 01:44:22,794

Okay. I'm reaching there.
I'II get there.

1596
01:44:27,074 --> 01:44:28,666
What's wrong?
AII okay with granny?

1597
01:44:28,742 --> 01:44:31,142
Sir, not granny. Sir, the poIice
has arrested Krish..

1598
01:44:31,211 --> 01:44:33,702
..in some drunk driving case.
-Oh, God. He is mad.

1599
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:36,248
Sir, pIease accompany me to

Oh, no. Where is he? -Inside.

Oh, God. Sir.

You wait here.

1608
01:44:58,772 --> 01:45:01,104
Oh, God. Look at Krish. -Hey, we
had caught him Iast time, too.

1609
01:45:01,174 --> 01:45:03,768
Yes, sir. He wiII be sentenced

Come in. TeII me.

1615

Krish PascaI. -What reIation

1617
01:45:27,734 --> 01:45:29,861
Is he your friend or brother?
-Sir, he is just my friend.

Sir, he beIongs to a good famiIy.

A good famiIy? -Then teII him to

I toId you, didn't I?
-PIease give me your number.

1638
01:46:12,245 --> 01:46:14,179
Stupid.
Idiot. When wiII you Iisten to me?

1639
01:46:14,247 --> 01:46:15,646
What's wrong with you?

1640
01:46:15,716 --> 01:46:17,343
June, Iisten to me.
-You Iisten to me.

1641
01:46:17,417 --> 01:46:19,408
Now see, you have to come
with me for Sunday mass..

1642
01:46:19,653 --> 01:46:21,416
..and you have to make a promise
that no more drinking.

1643
01:46:21,655 --> 01:46:24,215
Okay? -Okay. I promise. I'm
sorry. -Promise? -Promise.

1644
01:46:24,291 --> 01:46:24,689
Thank you, sir.

1645
01:46:24,758 --> 01:46:26,817
We were so worried.
-Don't shout at me. I'm sorry.

1646
01:46:26,893 --> 01:46:28,087
Thank you sir. -Oh, God.

1647
01:46:28,895 --> 01:46:31,329
Hey, dude, thanks. -It's okay.

1648
01:46:31,398 --> 01:46:34,367
And I'm sorry for that day.
-It's okay.

1649
01:46:35,168 --> 01:46:37,693
Thanks.
Come on, guys. -Yes, Iet's go.

1650
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:41,168
Sir, I'm so sorry for everything.

1651
01:46:41,241 --> 01:46:42,833
We were having so much fun.

1652
01:46:43,644 --> 01:46:45,407
But Iet's chiII out next week.
Okay? -Yes.

1653
01:46:45,879 --> 01:46:49,212
Thank you for everything. Bye.

1654
01:46:49,282 --> 01:46:50,306
Okay, bye.

1655
01:47:05,932 --> 01:47:07,763
Take this for your photo shoot.

1656
01:47:08,635 --> 01:47:11,729
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much, MiIind.

1657
01:47:13,140 --> 01:47:15,904
But I reaIIy cannot take this.
-Don't say no, pIease.

1658
01:47:17,144 --> 01:47:19,169
But how did you arrange it?

1659
01:47:19,246 --> 01:47:23,012
Forget aII that. You just
concentrate on your photo shoot.

1660
01:47:24,651 --> 01:47:28,678
Thank you so much, MiIind.
Thank you.

1661
01:47:30,424 --> 01:47:31,857
You are reaIIy a sweetheart.

1662
01:47:31,925 --> 01:47:36,089
Oh, my God. You are smiIing and
becoming emotionaI, too?

1663
01:47:36,163 --> 01:47:37,187
I Iike it.

1664
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:40,663
I'm going.
Best of Iuck for your photo shoot.

1665
01:47:40,967 --> 01:47:43,026
Thank you.
-WeIcome. AII right. Bye.

1666
01:47:47,340 --> 01:47:49,035
Wow.
I don't beIieve that there are..

1667
01:47:49,109 --> 01:47:50,838
..such peopIe in today's worId,
too.

1668
01:47:52,012 --> 01:47:53,741
AIas, if onIy I get such a boy.

1669
01:47:54,347 --> 01:47:55,939
I wiII Ieave everything
for his sake.

1670
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:14,759
What happened? -Nothing.

1671
01:48:17,337 --> 01:48:19,066
I'm noticing since the
Iast few days..

1672
01:48:19,740 --> 01:48:22,709
..that you don't have the same
touch or passion anymore.

1673
01:48:24,177 --> 01:48:27,943
What's wrong with you? -Nothing.

1674
01:48:31,885 --> 01:48:34,080
There must be so many peopIe
in so many famiIies..

1675
01:48:35,822 --> 01:48:40,088
..but how many of them reaIIy
Iove each other?

1676
01:48:45,265 --> 01:48:46,926
Do you beIieve in Iove, Anu?

1677
01:48:51,271 --> 01:48:52,761
Why are you asking this today?

1678
01:48:57,310 --> 01:48:58,368
Just Iike that.

1679
01:49:01,748 --> 01:49:04,308
You need a drink. -Yes.

1680
01:49:06,086 --> 01:49:07,917
PIease put your hands together..

1681
01:49:07,988 --> 01:49:09,717
..for the Iady behind 'Free
Hope Foundation'..

1682
01:49:09,790 --> 01:49:11,621
..the biggest charity
event of Goa.

1683
01:49:11,691 --> 01:49:13,659
Ms. Nikki Narang.

1684
01:49:42,289 --> 01:49:45,417
Ms. Nikki, do you think that
if a few weaIthy peopIe do..

1685
01:49:45,659 --> 01:49:46,648
..such type of an event..

1686
01:49:46,726 --> 01:49:47,385
..then there can be a change
in the society?

1687
01:49:47,627 --> 01:49:49,424
I don't think so. I beIieve so.

1688
01:49:49,830 --> 01:49:51,263
There wiII definiteIy be a change.

1689
01:49:51,331 --> 01:49:53,196
If you had not been industriaIist
Harsh Narang's daughter..

1690
01:49:53,266 --> 01:49:55,166
..wouId you have stiII taken
up such a mission?

1691
01:49:55,235 --> 01:49:56,759
Of course. I beIieve so.

1692
01:49:57,070 --> 01:49:58,196
ShaII I say something?

1693
01:49:58,271 --> 01:50:01,240
Charity is not done onIy
with money, but passion.

1694
01:50:02,375 --> 01:50:03,706
Do you beIieve in Iove?

1695
01:50:09,115 --> 01:50:10,810
Have you ever been in Iove,
Ms. Nikki?

1696
01:50:13,820 --> 01:50:17,017
WeII..yes, I'm in Iove.

1697
01:50:18,258 --> 01:50:19,748
In fact, I'm in Iove with you.

1698
01:50:21,761 --> 01:50:24,127
I mean I'm in Iove
with everything.

1699
01:50:24,831 --> 01:50:30,064
I Iove you. You aII. The poor
chiIdren, the environment..

1700
01:50:31,304 --> 01:50:34,364
In fact,
I Iove this entire universe.

1701
01:50:35,275 --> 01:50:36,299
Anything eIse?

1702
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:40,839
Thank you very much.

1703
01:51:12,979 --> 01:51:17,211
I won't see the morning
without you.

1704
01:51:17,918 --> 01:51:24,255
I have promised this
to my eyes just now.

1705
01:51:25,091 --> 01:51:29,357
To waIk without you is
aIso a punishment.

1706
01:51:30,096 --> 01:51:36,262
I promised the paths just now.

1707
01:51:37,070 --> 01:51:43,066
Listen, these are my feeIings.

1708
01:51:43,910 --> 01:51:50,907
They say I have desires
to Iive with you.

1709
01:51:51,151 --> 01:51:55,611
I wiII separate from my
breaths without you.

1710
01:51:56,022 --> 01:52:01,983
I have promised the
breeze just now.

1711
01:52:03,196 --> 01:52:07,690
I won't see the morning
without you.

1712
01:52:08,101 --> 01:52:14,370
I have promised this
to my eyes just now.

1713
01:52:29,222 --> 01:52:35,923
You are that Iand on which
I've settIed my worId.

1714
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:42,365
Where wiII I go without you now?

1715
01:52:43,036 --> 01:52:49,839
You are my support.
I Iive by trusting you.

1716
01:52:50,043 --> 01:52:56,175
I won't be abIe to Iive
without you anymore.

1717
01:52:56,683 --> 01:53:02,553
Each aspect of mine
begins from you.

1718
01:53:03,690 --> 01:53:10,254
You are my sun shine and rain.

1719
01:53:10,830 --> 01:53:14,960
This cIoud won't pour
without you.

1720
01:53:15,735 --> 01:53:21,833
I have made this promise
to the cIouds.

1721
01:53:22,942 --> 01:53:27,606
I won't see the morning
without you.

1722
01:53:27,847 --> 01:53:34,082
I have promised this
to my eyes just now.

1723
01:54:03,883 --> 01:54:04,907
Okay.

1724
01:54:05,852 --> 01:54:08,013
By the way, you both have
aIready got a divorce.

1725
01:54:08,188 --> 01:54:09,314
TechnicaIIy speaking..

1726
01:54:09,556 --> 01:54:11,615
..the Ietter wiII reach
you in a month or two.

1727
01:54:11,991 --> 01:54:13,720
Okay? Okay, Mr. Shirke.

1728
01:54:20,166 --> 01:54:21,190
Madhavi.

1729
01:54:26,039 --> 01:54:28,030
Thanks. -Thanks for what?

1730
01:54:30,176 --> 01:54:33,737
For compIeting aII this
gracefuIIy. No hard feeIings.

1731
01:54:35,281 --> 01:54:37,647
And, yes, June is a good girI.

1732
01:54:42,155 --> 01:54:44,953
No, I'm not having an
affair with June.

1733
01:54:45,625 --> 01:54:49,755
Come on, Naren. The same smiIe
has returned on your face.

1734
01:54:51,197 --> 01:54:52,687
Anyway, take care.

1735
01:54:53,233 --> 01:54:55,599
And aII the best.
-Thanks. You, too. -Bye.

1736
01:55:07,714 --> 01:55:10,274
HeIIo? Yes, Cherian.

1737
01:55:15,288 --> 01:55:16,619
Okay.

1738
01:55:24,631 --> 01:55:26,690
Gungun,
I searched you a Iot downstairs..

1739
01:55:26,766 --> 01:55:28,791
..but then Tamanna toId
me that you are here.

1740
01:55:29,702 --> 01:55:31,067
HeIIo? What's up?

1741
01:55:31,704 --> 01:55:33,899
Nothing is happening.
This is happening.

1742
01:55:35,642 --> 01:55:37,803
I tried my best.
I spent such a huge amount.

1743
01:55:38,344 --> 01:55:39,709
Everything is a waste.

1744
01:55:40,013 --> 01:55:42,277
They signed the star's daughter
as the heroine at Iast.

1745
01:55:42,949 --> 01:55:45,679
If they wanted to make the star's
daughter the heroine..

1746
01:55:45,752 --> 01:55:47,049
..why did they have
to do a drama of..

1747
01:55:47,120 --> 01:55:48,587
..this photo shoot
and this audition?

1748
01:55:48,655 --> 01:55:50,316
Come on, Gungun. It happens.

1749
01:55:51,691 --> 01:55:55,058
Now I feeI I must be
Iacking something.

1750
01:55:55,795 --> 01:55:58,696
PIease,
Gungun, you don't Iack anything.

1751
01:55:59,098 --> 01:56:02,363
The worId has not ended if
you didn't get a fiIm.

1752
01:56:03,136 --> 01:56:06,299
There is a big worId besides
the fiIms, too..

1753
01:56:06,372 --> 01:56:08,340
..where the peopIe Iove you.

1754
01:56:08,942 --> 01:56:11,376
This smiIing, beautifuI Gungun.

1755
01:56:12,111 --> 01:56:13,237
Like me.

1756
01:56:14,981 --> 01:56:16,949
You are saying sweet things
to make me feeI good.

1757
01:56:17,016 --> 01:56:19,246
No, no.
I swear by my third-cIass poems..

1758
01:56:19,319 --> 01:56:22,413
..that you are reaIIy beautifuI
and no one can stop you..

1759
01:56:22,655 --> 01:56:23,986
..from becoming a star.

1760
01:56:25,091 --> 01:56:27,389
Look,
see through my point of view once.

1761
01:56:27,994 --> 01:56:29,359
You are a star, okay?

1762
01:56:30,063 --> 01:56:31,621
And you are going to go so far..

1763
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,694
Thanks, MiIind, for being there.

1764
01:56:40,139 --> 01:56:45,702
PIease don't ever Ieave me.
-I never wiII.

1765
01:56:45,778 --> 01:56:46,802
I Iove you.

1766
01:56:49,015 --> 01:56:50,312
I Iove you.

1767
01:56:51,784 --> 01:56:54,014
I Iove you. -Me, too.

1768
01:56:56,956 --> 01:56:58,184
Sir. Sir. -Yes?

1769
01:56:58,858 --> 01:56:59,984
I need a favor, sir.

1770
01:57:00,293 --> 01:57:02,261
You want a hoIiday? -No, sir.

1771
01:57:02,829 --> 01:57:04,262
Someone is harassing you again?

1772
01:57:04,631 --> 01:57:07,293
No, sir.
Listen to me first. -TeII me.

1773
01:57:07,967 --> 01:57:10,231
What are you doing the day after?
-Nothing much.

1774
01:57:11,237 --> 01:57:13,068
You have to come to my
house for dinner.

1775
01:57:16,075 --> 01:57:19,169
Anything speciaI?
-My granny has invited you.

1776
01:57:21,648 --> 01:57:24,640
For what? -Granny wants to
taIk about something.

1777
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:28,311
Regarding what?

1778
01:57:28,888 --> 01:57:32,085
It is a surprise, sir.
And, yes, wouId you Iike to have..

1779
01:57:32,158 --> 01:57:33,785
..spicy Goan food with red wine?

1780
01:57:34,894 --> 01:57:36,987
8pm. Don't make it Iate, okay?

1781
01:57:38,131 --> 01:57:39,155
HeIIo, sir.

1782
01:57:41,434 --> 01:57:43,334
I wiII definiteIy come if
granny has invited me.

1783
01:57:44,270 --> 01:57:45,737
I'II be there. I'II be there.

1784
01:57:45,805 --> 01:57:48,774
Thank you so much.
Bye. -Bye, June.

1785
01:58:04,123 --> 01:58:09,390
HeIIo? Yes?

1786
01:58:15,401 --> 01:58:19,394
Abby, you are Iate. -Yes.

1787
01:58:21,808 --> 01:58:26,905
Anu, this is the bike key.
I don't want it.

1788
01:58:29,916 --> 01:58:35,047
Why? I see.
You want a car? I Iike it.

1789
01:58:36,022 --> 01:58:37,046
No, it is not so.

1790
01:58:37,924 --> 01:58:39,323
You Iook very stressed out. Come.

1791
01:58:39,392 --> 01:58:41,792
Come here. Come here. Come.
Come. Come. -No. I'm okay.

1792
01:58:42,862 --> 01:58:45,092
Okay, Iisten.
I'm going to MaIdives next week.

1793
01:58:45,164 --> 01:58:47,325
I have a pIan to buy a property.
-Come, we'II go together.

1794
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,698
We'II have Iots of fun.
-Anu, I can't be with you anymore.

1795
01:58:51,437 --> 01:58:52,631
What?

1796
01:58:54,207 --> 01:58:55,333
I won't meet you again.

1797
01:58:59,846 --> 01:59:01,905
It's over. -You are joking.

1798
01:59:03,182 --> 01:59:04,206
I'm serious.

1799
01:59:06,386 --> 01:59:09,651
Why? You want to become
a gym trainer again?

1800
01:59:12,091 --> 01:59:13,581
Look, Abby, what's the matter?

1801
01:59:13,659 --> 01:59:15,593
Where eIse wiII you get aII this?
-We are having fun, right?

1802
01:59:15,661 --> 01:59:16,992
What..what probIem do you have?

1803
01:59:17,063 --> 01:59:18,155
Aren't we having fun?

1804
01:59:18,731 --> 01:59:20,323
Anu, I'm in Iove. -What?

1805
01:59:21,768 --> 01:59:23,793
I'm reaIIy sorry.

1806
01:59:25,605 --> 01:59:27,800
Thank you for everything.
-Who is that girI?

1807
01:59:29,909 --> 01:59:31,399
Anu,
why do you want to know her name?

1808
01:59:31,778 --> 01:59:32,802
Who is she?

1809
01:59:33,112 --> 01:59:34,807
The one whom you are
thinking about.

1810
01:59:36,215 --> 01:59:37,239
Nikki.

1811
01:59:46,159 --> 01:59:47,183
Just go.

1812
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,123
Anu, I want you to.. -Just Ieave.

1813
01:59:52,932 --> 01:59:53,956
Just go.

1814
02:00:01,908 --> 02:00:05,139
This is for you, Gungun.
Love you, Gungun.

1815
02:00:05,845 --> 02:00:07,039
Be carefuI. Be carefuI.

1816
02:00:08,881 --> 02:00:09,905
Can you beIieve it?

1817
02:00:10,383 --> 02:00:11,816
MiracIes occur today, too.

1818
02:00:12,385 --> 02:00:15,183
Check it out. -Does she Iove you
Iike a sister Ioves her brother?

1819
02:00:15,254 --> 02:00:18,951
Shut up. My true Iove has won.

1820
02:00:20,026 --> 02:00:21,721
I have written a poem
on it as weII.

1821
02:00:21,794 --> 02:00:24,262
Poet, pIease don't recite it.
She wiII run away.

1822
02:00:24,797 --> 02:00:27,732
Don't be ridicuIous.
She Ioves my poetry. Yes.

1823
02:00:28,134 --> 02:00:30,830
Banker, he has succeeded.

1824
02:00:32,071 --> 02:00:33,766
But how far has your
Iove story reached?

1825
02:00:35,074 --> 02:00:38,202
June's granny has invited
me for dinner.

1826
02:00:39,111 --> 02:00:42,342
I have heard that mummy invites
peopIe for tea..

1827
02:00:42,415 --> 02:00:43,382
..but I'm hearing for
the first time..

1828
02:00:43,616 --> 02:00:44,810
..that the granny has
invited someone.

1829
02:00:44,884 --> 02:00:46,408
It is the Ieap of one
whoIe generation.

1830
02:00:47,253 --> 02:00:48,345
Look who is taIking.

1831
02:00:48,421 --> 02:00:50,787
Two generations are invoIved
in your Iove story, too.

1832
02:00:50,857 --> 02:00:53,155
Are you going on with the mother
or the daughter nowadays?

1833
02:00:53,793 --> 02:00:57,194
No, I can't Iive without Nikki.
Anushka's out.

1834
02:00:58,898 --> 02:01:00,331
Think about it. -I have decided.

1835
02:01:01,267 --> 02:01:03,132
I don't want Anushka's
Iove and comforts.

1836
02:01:03,836 --> 02:01:05,565
There is nothing greater
than Iove.

1837
02:01:05,638 --> 02:01:08,038
See? MiracIes occur today, too.

1838
02:01:09,075 --> 02:01:11,270
So cheers in the name of the Iove
stories of the three of us.

1839
02:01:11,711 --> 02:01:12,735
You know what?

1840
02:01:12,812 --> 02:01:15,372
I think this house is reaIIy
Iucky for the three of us.

1841
02:01:16,115 --> 02:01:17,275
See? Didn't I say that?

1842
02:01:17,383 --> 02:01:18,816
So cheers again. -AII right.

1843
02:01:18,885 --> 02:01:21,353
In the name of this house.
-Cheers. -Cheers.

1844
02:01:24,390 --> 02:01:27,917
HeIIo, Brother. -HeIIo, sir.
HeIIo. -Make my favourite one.

1845
02:01:27,994 --> 02:01:30,622
Sir, the bouquet is absoIuteIy
ready for you today. -How?

1846
02:01:30,930 --> 02:01:35,230
Your radio friend Gungun has
reserved a bouquet for you today.

1847
02:01:35,668 --> 02:01:37,602
Oh, fantastic. -And a Ietter, too.

1848
02:01:38,237 --> 02:01:41,229
MarveIIous. -Sir, this is the
bouquet and the Ietter.

1849
02:01:41,307 --> 02:01:45,209
Oh, Iove is fuII of surprises.
-That's true, sir.

1850
02:01:45,278 --> 02:01:47,303
Take it. -No,
she has aIready paid for it, sir.

1851
02:01:47,380 --> 02:01:49,348
No, it is a tip from me.

1852
02:01:49,715 --> 02:01:52,343
Okay, I'II take it if you insist.
-Yes.

1853
02:01:55,855 --> 02:01:58,187
'Hi, MiIind. I don't have
the guts to face you..'

1854
02:01:58,257 --> 02:01:59,724
'..that's why I'm writing
this Ietter.'

1855
02:01:59,792 --> 02:02:02,625
'I have finaIIy got MurIi Shankar
Venu's TamiI fiIm.'

1856
02:02:03,062 --> 02:02:04,290
'So I'm going to Chennai.'

1857
02:02:05,131 --> 02:02:07,691
'After this, I wonder when we
wiII meet in Iife again.'

1858
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,024
'What shouId I do?'

1859
02:02:09,101 --> 02:02:12,127
'FiIms were aIways my first
Iove and not you.'

1860
02:02:12,672 --> 02:02:16,130
'You were just Gungun's option
in her Iife, a compromise.'

1861
02:02:16,342 --> 02:02:18,810
'And one can't spend Iife on
the basis of a compromise.'

1862
02:02:19,145 --> 02:02:20,840
'Won't you understand me?'

1863
02:02:21,847 --> 02:02:23,371
'I'II never be abIe
to forget you.'

1864
02:02:24,183 --> 02:02:28,176
'But you? MiIind,
pIease forget me. I'm sorry.'

1865
02:02:29,055 --> 02:02:30,079
'Take care.'

1866
02:03:06,926 --> 02:03:09,861
Okay, I need these on both the
sides of the road. Okay, Vijay?

1867
02:03:09,929 --> 02:03:10,953
Okay. -Oh, great.

1868
02:03:11,998 --> 02:03:13,192
Hey, Nikki, is this okay?

1869
02:03:13,733 --> 02:03:15,360
It's perfect. -Thanks.

1870
02:03:15,968 --> 02:03:17,799
Nikki, the news channeI
peopIe want your byte.

1871
02:03:17,870 --> 02:03:20,338
No. Just ask them to wait. Later.
-Okay, I'II do that.

1872
02:03:21,307 --> 02:03:23,901
Hi, Nikki. -Hey, hi. How are you?
-Wait. One second.

1873
02:03:23,976 --> 02:03:26,137
Do you have a Iist of voIunteers,
AIIan? -You got it. -Okay.

1874
02:03:26,212 --> 02:03:28,976
You seem busy. -So busy. By
the way, how are you here?

1875
02:03:29,048 --> 02:03:30,777
WiII you aIso participate
in this event?

1876
02:03:31,083 --> 02:03:32,778
Of course. Why onIy this event?

1877
02:03:32,852 --> 02:03:34,820
I'II participate in aII
the other events, too.

1878
02:03:35,254 --> 02:03:37,745
May be I'II even join you in
New York. -New York? Why?

1879
02:03:38,290 --> 02:03:40,053
What do you mean by why?
To be with you.

1880
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:42,757
To be with me?
What are you taIking about?

1881
02:03:46,065 --> 02:03:48,397
I'II be wherever you are, Nikki.
I have decided.

1882
02:03:49,635 --> 02:03:51,899
One second.
One second. What have you decided?

1883
02:03:52,371 --> 02:03:54,339
Rohini, I'II join you in two
seconds. -Okay, ma'am.

1884
02:03:54,407 --> 02:03:55,601
Just come here.

1885
02:03:57,810 --> 02:03:59,835
What's wrong with you?
Have you Iost your mind?

1886
02:04:00,279 --> 02:04:01,940
Just because I enjoy
your company..

1887
02:04:02,014 --> 02:04:03,572
..it doesn't mean that
I'm in Iove with you..

1888
02:04:03,649 --> 02:04:05,879
..or I want to spend my
entire Iife with you.

1889
02:04:05,951 --> 02:04:07,179
I mean, come on.

1890
02:04:07,353 --> 02:04:09,583
It means whatever happened
between us in Goa..

1891
02:04:09,655 --> 02:04:11,919
..it didn't mean anything, right?

1892
02:04:11,991 --> 02:04:13,117
Of course not.

1893
02:04:13,192 --> 02:04:15,592
Why are you taIking Iike
a 14-year-oId teenager?

1894
02:04:15,795 --> 02:04:17,922
I mean whatever happened there
at that time is now over.

1895
02:04:17,997 --> 02:04:21,057
No big deaI. -Neither was it the
first time for me nor for you.

1896
02:04:21,133 --> 02:04:22,930
So wiII you just grow up?

1897
02:04:23,836 --> 02:04:27,169
So it means that..
-It means? It means what, Abhay?

1898
02:04:27,373 --> 02:04:29,000
Okay,
shaII I say it in simpIe words?

1899
02:04:29,742 --> 02:04:31,710
You are not my type.

1900
02:04:32,078 --> 02:04:34,342
Our worIds are too different,
Abhay. Okay?

1901
02:04:35,281 --> 02:04:36,873
Nikki, I can't Iive without you.

1902
02:04:37,750 --> 02:04:39,217
You'II do just fine, stud.

1903
02:04:39,652 --> 02:04:41,847
No one dies without anyone. Okay?

1904
02:04:45,691 --> 02:04:48,990
You have dumped Anushka,
but she is stiII surviving, right?

1905
02:05:19,125 --> 02:05:20,149
Hi, sir. -Hi.

1906
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:22,655
This is for you.
-Thank you so much.

1907
02:05:22,928 --> 02:05:24,919
And wine for granny. -Thank you.

1908
02:05:25,664 --> 02:05:27,894
Granny, Mr. Naren has come.

1909
02:05:28,100 --> 02:05:30,591
Mr. Naren, thank you for coming.
-My pIeasure.

1910
02:05:31,137 --> 02:05:33,697
June taIks about you
the entire day.

1911
02:05:34,006 --> 02:05:36,099
My boss is this,
my boss is that.

1912
02:05:36,175 --> 02:05:37,802
She is reaIIy fond of you.

1913
02:05:38,611 --> 02:05:40,977
ShaII we come to the point now?
-Oh, sure.

1914
02:05:42,248 --> 02:05:45,581
Look, June is my baby. I have
brought her up since chiIdhood.

1915
02:05:46,018 --> 02:05:47,849
So obviousIy her granny
wiII be worried..

1916
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:51,617
..about getting her married. -Yes.

1917
02:05:52,158 --> 02:05:54,058
Look, she is a very good girI.

1918
02:05:54,126 --> 02:05:56,321
But she is IittIe crazy and moody.

1919
02:05:56,796 --> 02:05:57,888
Don't compIain Iater.

1920
02:05:57,963 --> 02:06:01,194
No, Aunty.
I mean, Granny. I know. I know.

1921
02:06:01,267 --> 02:06:03,929
It is not easy to become
her Iife partner.

1922
02:06:04,770 --> 02:06:06,237
She is a compIeteIy chiId.

1923
02:06:06,305 --> 02:06:08,239
She seeks a Iot of attention.

1924
02:06:10,409 --> 02:06:11,933
Granny, every girI wants that.

1925
02:06:12,278 --> 02:06:15,679
See, June. You need this
maturity in a husband.

1926
02:06:15,915 --> 02:06:19,248
Caste, creed, weaIth, status..
Nothing eIse is important.

1927
02:06:19,985 --> 02:06:22,351
I just want a husband
who Ioves my baby..

1928
02:06:22,421 --> 02:06:24,116
..who wiII take care of her.

1929
02:06:24,423 --> 02:06:28,757
ActuaIIy, who wiII take
care of her if I die?

1930
02:06:29,295 --> 02:06:32,787
Granny, why are you saying this?
We are here.

1931
02:06:32,865 --> 02:06:35,390
TeII me. WiII that Krish PascaI
be abIe to take care of her..

1932
02:06:35,634 --> 02:06:38,432
..and understand her?

1933
02:06:45,711 --> 02:06:48,874
Yes. I was aIso shocked Iike
you when I came to know..

1934
02:06:48,948 --> 02:06:51,143
..that she wants to
marry Krish PascaI.

1935
02:06:51,450 --> 02:06:54,044
By the way, I know that
famiIy since chiIdhood.

1936
02:06:54,420 --> 02:06:57,583
But teII me,
isn't it taking pIace very fast?

1937
02:06:57,656 --> 02:06:58,918
It is not very fast, Granny.

1938
02:06:58,991 --> 02:07:00,959
Krish has got such a
good job in Muscat.

1939
02:07:01,026 --> 02:07:02,687
So his parents said that get
married first and then go.

1940
02:07:02,761 --> 02:07:05,127
So what's wrong with that?
-Sir, you teII me.

1941
02:07:05,197 --> 02:07:08,064
Yes, Mr. Naren, she reaIIy
respects you.

1942
02:07:08,133 --> 02:07:09,896
Whatever you say,
wiII be the finaI word.

1943
02:07:17,810 --> 02:07:21,610
June is right.
Her decision is right.

1944
02:07:23,349 --> 02:07:25,249
I can see that she
Ioves Krish a Iot.

1945
02:07:25,317 --> 02:07:26,341
Think once more..

1946
02:07:27,152 --> 02:07:29,712
..and they have broken-up
many times, too..

1947
02:07:29,788 --> 02:07:32,188
..and they have broken-up
many times, too.

1948
02:07:32,691 --> 02:07:33,851
WiII this marriage work?

1949
02:07:37,129 --> 02:07:38,153
It wiII work.

1950
02:07:39,131 --> 02:07:41,122
It is important for any
reIationship to have Iove.

1951
02:07:42,301 --> 02:07:43,859
Everything eIse is sorted out.

1952
02:07:44,169 --> 02:07:47,764
You are right. You are right,
a reIationship shouId have Iove.

1953
02:07:49,275 --> 02:07:53,678
June, your boss has finaIised it.
My tension is over.

1954
02:07:54,013 --> 02:07:55,810
Come on, we'II ceIebrate now.

1955
02:07:55,881 --> 02:07:57,940
You both drink wine and I'II
Iay out the dinner.

1956
02:07:59,852 --> 02:08:02,150
Love you, Granny.
-God bIess you. God bIess you.

1957
02:08:03,989 --> 02:08:05,013
Thanks.

1958
02:08:09,128 --> 02:08:12,962
What if I had refused for your
marriage before granny?

1959
02:08:13,032 --> 02:08:16,729
ImpossibIe, sir. You can't go
wrong. You are my buddy.

1960
02:08:17,036 --> 02:08:20,631
Who understands me better
than you? -Me.

1961
02:08:21,607 --> 02:08:23,234
One second.
One second, sir. Did you forget?

1962
02:08:23,776 --> 02:08:26,210
WhiIe saying cheers, we have to
Iook into each others eyes.

1963
02:08:26,278 --> 02:08:27,302
Otherwise..

1964
02:08:27,913 --> 02:08:30,381
Bad sex Iife for the next
seven years. -Correct.

1965
02:08:31,183 --> 02:08:32,207
Cheers. -Cheers.

1966
02:09:03,015 --> 02:09:09,181
To teII you the truth, expecting
true Iove is just too much.

1967
02:09:10,222 --> 02:09:15,683
Love in aII its forms
is just an iIIusion.

1968
02:09:16,061 --> 02:09:18,996
It's a bIind man's dream.

1969
02:09:19,331 --> 02:09:21,629
It's a deaf man's song.

1970
02:09:22,634 --> 02:09:29,938
Love in aII its forms
is just an iIIusion.

1971
02:09:30,175 --> 02:09:40,016
I wish I had someone
I couId caII mine.

1972
02:09:40,619 --> 02:09:45,420
If not cIose by,
then at a far away pIace.

1973
02:09:45,824 --> 02:09:49,692
But I wish I had someone.

1974
02:10:17,089 --> 02:10:18,989
It's quite unfortunate, isn't it?
-Yes, buddy.

1975
02:10:19,058 --> 02:10:20,855
India Iost the match
by just three runs.

1976
02:10:22,227 --> 02:10:23,956
Hey,
I'm not taIking about the match.

1977
02:10:24,830 --> 02:10:27,298
After three months, three guys
didn't get even one girI.

1978
02:10:27,800 --> 02:10:29,165
It can't get worse.

1979
02:10:30,135 --> 02:10:32,069
Okay, forget it.
For the next 10 days in Goa..

1980
02:10:32,137 --> 02:10:35,231
..no one wiII taIk about girIs.
No one wiII taIk to girIs.

1981
02:10:35,774 --> 02:10:37,833
No one wiII chase girIs.
-Yes, buddy.

1982
02:10:38,377 --> 02:10:40,971
From now on, no Iove, no affair,
no one-night stands.

1983
02:10:41,747 --> 02:10:43,146
GirIs.. I just don't understand.

1984
02:10:44,249 --> 02:10:46,877
I have aIready decided that
I won't even Iook at..

1985
02:10:46,952 --> 02:10:48,317
..the airhostess in the pIane.

1986
02:10:48,620 --> 02:10:51,418
Forget girIs, if need be,
we wiII marry each other.

1987
02:10:53,092 --> 02:10:54,889
Just a thought. -Bad thought.

1988
02:11:00,699 --> 02:11:02,166
Go and get the boarding cards.
-Yes.

1989
02:11:02,901 --> 02:11:04,163
I'm going to the bookstore.

1990
02:11:04,236 --> 02:11:06,170
I badIy need a book of 'Hanuman
ChaIisa' (HoIy hymns).

1991
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:07,364
Get one for me as weII.

1992
02:11:20,219 --> 02:11:23,950
HeIIo. Is there a Hindi book here?

1993
02:11:24,323 --> 02:11:26,791
Sorry, I don't..
-Why is it not there?

1994
02:11:28,060 --> 02:11:30,995
What do you think? You think
that no one reads Hindi..

1995
02:11:31,063 --> 02:11:33,258
..Marathi or Gujarati books in
India? -Ma'am, sorry, I..

1996
02:11:33,332 --> 02:11:36,028
No, no. If you won't keep
those books here..

1997
02:11:36,101 --> 02:11:38,228
..peopIe won't read them and
if they won't read them..

1998
02:11:38,303 --> 02:11:41,170
..you won't stack them here.
This is Iike a vicious circIe.

1999
02:11:41,240 --> 02:11:44,038
A vicious circIe. -No,
there's been a misunderstanding.

2000
02:11:44,109 --> 02:11:46,873
Give me an answer.
Why are there no Hindi books here?

2001
02:11:46,945 --> 02:11:49,778
Because I don't work here.
I'm not a saIesman.

2002
02:11:55,120 --> 02:11:58,021
I'm.. I'm extremeIy sorry.
-It's.. It's okay.

2003
02:11:58,690 --> 02:12:01,056
You couId've aIso
said it in Hindi.

2004
02:12:06,665 --> 02:12:08,292
I'm sorry. -It's okay.

2005
02:12:08,367 --> 02:12:12,133
Hi, I'm Swati Paranjpe.
-You are a Maharastrian? Me, too.

2006
02:12:12,337 --> 02:12:14,771
ReaIIy? -MiIind KeIkar, from Pune.

2007
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:16,808
I'm from DhoIe PatiI road.

2008
02:12:16,875 --> 02:12:19,343
I'm from Koregaon Paat.
It's quite near to your pIace.

2009
02:12:20,279 --> 02:12:23,180
I'm sorry. It was very siIIy
what happened a whiIe ago.

2010
02:12:23,815 --> 02:12:24,839
I'm used to it.

2011
02:12:25,851 --> 02:12:29,184
By the way, I aIso read EngIish
books. -ReaIIy? -I Iike them.

2012
02:12:29,621 --> 02:12:32,021
Okay,
then, this is a very good book.

2013
02:12:36,662 --> 02:12:39,096
Oh, God. Oh, God.

2014
02:12:45,604 --> 02:12:47,765
PIease heIp me. PIease heIp me.
-Hey, what are you doing?

2015
02:12:47,839 --> 02:12:49,739
PIease.
My boyfriend is chasing me.

2016
02:12:49,808 --> 02:12:52,038
He's here.
Your boyfriend's here. -Hey, Pia.

2017
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:53,338
What's happening?
What's going on here?

2018
02:12:53,412 --> 02:12:56,313
Who's this guy?
-Can't you see? We are romancing.

2019
02:12:57,282 --> 02:13:00,342
Oh, by the way, meet my new
boyfriend. -What? -What?

2020
02:13:00,786 --> 02:13:03,084
Yes. My new boyfriend Raj. -Okay.

2021
02:13:03,956 --> 02:13:05,287
It's not Raj, it's Abhay. -Okay.

2022
02:13:05,991 --> 02:13:08,721
So I Iove him, not you. -But why?

2023
02:13:08,994 --> 02:13:11,292
Why? Because I just Iove him.

2024
02:13:11,363 --> 02:13:13,627
I Iove his eyes.
I Iove the way he kisses.

2025
02:13:13,899 --> 02:13:16,959
And his heart. -You know what?
I just Iove everything about him.

2026
02:13:17,035 --> 02:13:21,028
And you.. You Akash.. You're
a Iousy.. You're a psycho..

2027
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:23,208
You're a possessive and
dopey boyfriend.

2028
02:13:23,609 --> 02:13:26,043
So you know what? Just get Iost.
It's aII over.

Oh, wow. You just saved me.
-Don't mention it.

MiIind Ahuja.

Neha Desai.

2056
02:15:00,872 --> 02:15:04,933
I heard that the whoIe process
is quite stressfuI.

2057
02:15:06,111 --> 02:15:08,011
In the earIy stages,
it is a bit of a probIem.

2058
02:15:08,580 --> 02:15:10,241
But sIowIy,
you get used to the IoneIiness.

ReaIIy? -Yes.

But you shouIdn't be aIone.

You shouId be with some reIatives,
