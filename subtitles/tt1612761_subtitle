1
00:01:14,307 --> 00:01:16,434
Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

2
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:24,279
Congrats,
you got lucky on the first day.

3
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:26,315
Meaning?

4
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:30,287
I mean, our madam starts her
day by slapping someone.

5
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,391
Madam's astrologer... that...

6
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:34,517
Feng-shui people say
that the first...

7
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:37,263
person who gets slapped
by madam...

8
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,455
is very lucky.
He becomes a big director.

9
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:42,459
But why did she slap me?

10
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:45,304
Everything is done thrice here.

11
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:47,339
And you saluted just once.

12
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:50,341
Now don't err again or
else you'll be fired.

13
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:51,343
Got it?

14
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:52,445
Yes.
-What?

15
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,471
Yes. Yes. Yes.

16
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,407
Yes!

17
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,445
Madam, 325 episode of Kyun Ki
Saas Bhi Thi Bhari is ready.

18
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:05,356
We reshoot the heroine in dark
blue ear rings as you said.

19
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:06,414
And madam...

20
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,351
No, no. Reshoot it.

21
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,259
Instead of dark green
use yellow ear rings.

22
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,423
And add 3 more diamonds in them.

23
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:16,492
Priest said that planets have
changed their positions.

24
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,372
But heroine fainted thrice
and is hospitalized.

25
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,464
She can't shoot.

26
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:24,434
Idiot. Change the storyline.

27
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,279
And put the character
in hospital too.

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,316
And after sending her to hospital
start her real treatment.

29
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:33,443
Yes...
-But I want yellow ear rings.

30
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,447
It will give us more advantage.

31
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,388
God forbid, if...

32
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:40,415
our heroine acts smart...

33
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:43,329
then we'll show these
shots of hospital...

34
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:46,455
we'll show her dead
in the serial.

35
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:49,392
The way we did we most
of our actors...

36
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:52,403
who tried to play
tricks with me.

37
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,373
Madam, you're really genius.

38
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,475
I know that.

39
00:02:56,543 --> 00:03:01,344
Madam, for 'Kahi Kisi Ki Khoj',
I've called 72 old women.

40
00:03:01,381 --> 00:03:03,349
Please finalize them.

41
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,350
For that role cast my driver's
daughter, Kaushalya.

42
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,477
But she's 17 years old.

43
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,311
So?

44
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:13,257
Total of her birth date
is my lucky number.

45
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:17,329
Ok. But for a role of 119
years old granny...

46
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,489
17 years young girl...

47
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,321
Why not?

48
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:24,269
I want to fill grannies of this
country with new vigour.

49
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:26,338
I want to inspire them.

50
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:28,304
You've already done that.

51
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,342
Many senior citizen aunties...

52
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,241
have given up temple
and worship...

53
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,440
and going to beauty parlors
and casting agents.

54
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,484
And they don't even fear
casting couch, madam.

55
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,511
You're really genius, madam.

56
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:43,388
She knows it.
-Sorry.

57
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,414
Good morning, Anekta.

58
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,486
No, it's not good. It's bad.

59
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:50,325
I can see from the face.

60
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:52,361
What's written in this letter?

61
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,470
Scum!

62
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,394
How dare they!

63
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:02,466
Go and tell them...

64
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,334
Lalaji telefilms doesn't
run moon TV...

65
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:09,404
but moon TV runs Lalaji telefilms.
-You've said it wrong.

66
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,384
Moon TV doesn't run Lalaji.
-Lalaji runs moon TV.

67
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,407
I mean, whatever.

68
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,480
I'm the queen of Indian
television.

69
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,345
And how dare they...

70
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:20,358
give such a threatening
letter to me.

71
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,388
My 39 shows are running
on diff channels. -Yes.

72
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,465
And 11 more shows will come.

73
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,290
This moon TV...

74
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,402
doesn't know Lalaji telefilms.

75
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,399
I'll teach them a lesson.

76
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,436
Go and make all the shows
of moon TV to shut down.

77
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:45,315
Now Lalaji telefilms will
boycott moon TV.

78
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,476
She'll mess with programs.

79
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,351
She'll fight with channels.

80
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,289
Any problems? Say it aloud.

81
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:53,485
No, madam. I was saying...

82
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,354
that this channel wants
to mess with you.

83
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,328
Madam, they don't know...

84
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,423
that you can shut
their channels too.

85
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:06,370
But madam,
you're queen of Indian television.

86
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,374
And queen should be generous and
forgive the innocent people.

87
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,469
And madam, you shouldn't get
involved with such people.

88
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,304
You've already fought with...

89
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:17,474
I mean, you've taken big
challenges with them.

90
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,307
This is nothing.

91
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:22,353
I'm sure, something will work out.

92
00:05:56,489 --> 00:06:00,323
Sometimes I saw in shade...

93
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:06,322
Sometimes I saw in sun...

94
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,463
Sometimes I saw in shade...

95
00:06:12,305 --> 00:06:14,500
Sometimes I saw in sun...

96
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:21,338
I've seen life in diff forms.

97
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:27,408
It is filled with merriment
and problems.

98
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:30,479
The season is erratic too.

99
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,424
What's this world?

100
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:37,486
Idiot box! Idiot box!

101
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:43,462
Idiot box! Idiot box!

102
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:10,429
There is disloyalty
in name of loyalty.

103
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:16,459
There is celebration
and mourning too.

104
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:26,278
There is disloyalty
in name of loyalty.

105
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:32,342
There is celebration
and mourning too.

106
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:35,354
Relationships are shattered now.

107
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:38,380
There is fake love
in very heart.

108
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,393
Trust is in danger.

109
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:44,294
What's this world?

110
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,391
Idiot box! Idiot box!

111
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:54,438
Idiot box! Idiot box!

112
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:15,316
Everyone is estranged here.

113
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:21,458
Even kin is unaware of us.

114
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:30,342
Everyone is estranged here.

115
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:36,348
Even kin are unaware of us.

116
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:39,451
There is a mask on every face.

117
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,250
Eyes hold illusions.

118
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:46,258
There is dilemma too.

119
00:08:46,392 --> 00:08:48,383
What's this world?

120
00:08:48,394 --> 00:08:52,421
Idiot box! Idiot box!

121
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:59,327
Idiot box! Idiot box!

122
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:10,476
Mr. Rajnikant Bose who was
once CEO of moon TV...

123
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,442
gave your reference.

124
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,478
He said that in Kolkatta
in his Bengali channel...

125
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,314
you brought record
improvement in...

126
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,360
TRPs of many shows on channels.

127
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,422
I want you to join my
production house.

128
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:28,290
As a creative director.

129
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:31,334
And work the same magic here.

130
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,369
Yeah. I'll try.
-That...

131
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,331
What's your name?

132
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:39,444
Shu...
-Shubrojit Chakravarty.

133
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:41,471
God! It's a real tongue twister.

134
00:09:42,448 --> 00:09:44,382
I'll call you Shu...

135
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,442
Shu?
-Yes.

136
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:48,375
No...

137
00:09:50,323 --> 00:09:51,312
No issue.

138
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,413
Ok.
-Shu is fine.

139
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:55,521
Shu is good. Let's start with Shu.

140
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,353
S for shooting. S for success.

141
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,453
S is very good.

142
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,426
Shu,
you'll get the scripts and DVDs...

143
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,301
of previous episodes
of this show.

144
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:09,467
But before that I need your
personal details. -Yeah.

145
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,300
I'm written everything
in my résumé.

146
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,308
I know that.

147
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:20,283
But besides that I need your
birth date, time and place...

148
00:10:20,419 --> 00:10:24,287
and horoscopes,
lineage, planetary positions...

149
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:27,383
and even the exact spelling
of your name.

150
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,455
Submit all these details
to Nandita.

151
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:34,458
I've some rules that
I always follow.

152
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,268
When I work with a new employee...

153
00:10:38,437 --> 00:10:41,372
I match our horoscopes.

154
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,374
If our horoscopes matches...

155
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,376
then our alliance will be fixed.

156
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,276
Excuse me.

157
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,386
Alliance of employee and employer.

158
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,421
Of servant and boss. Ok?

159
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,346
Sure.

160
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:00,392
I mean sure.

161
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:18,410
What the...

162
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,335
Let's go.

163
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,349
You're not doing it right.

164
00:11:24,383 --> 00:11:25,509
What did I do?

165
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,318
You don't love me.

166
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,482
Nandita, who told you this?

167
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,349
Why are you so insecure,
my love?

168
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:35,416
I'm always with you.

169
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:39,294
Then why did you appoint one
more creative director?

170
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,424
You don't trust me anymore.

171
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:44,426
Nandita, you're so over worked.

172
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:47,498
You don't even get time
for your self.

173
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,304
How much will you work?

174
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,512
Have you even seen your
face in mirror?

175
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,311
You look pale.

176
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,312
You need to go on a holiday.

177
00:11:58,417 --> 00:11:59,406
And relax.

178
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:02,318
Ok? So I should holiday alone.

179
00:12:02,488 --> 00:12:04,353
Ok, dear.

180
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,458
I'll find some time for you, but...

181
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:09,386
you should always remember...

182
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,455
you're an assets in
Lalaji Telefilms.

183
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:17,495
You were, you're and you'll
be in this company.

184
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,428
With me.
-Thank you so much.

185
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,406
And nobody can snatch
you right from here.

186
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,342
Thanks, Anekta.

187
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,445
But thank me later.

188
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:29,336
On valentine's day.

189
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:30,437
Ok?
-Why?

190
00:12:30,516 --> 00:12:35,283
Because on that day I'll give
you a surprise gift.

191
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,389
Surprise gift? Tell me.

192
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,450
Not now, later.
-Please tell me.

193
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:43,352
I said not now. Nandita.

194
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,319
Ok.

195
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:50,299
On valentine's day I'll
gift you BMW car.

196
00:12:51,002 --> 00:12:52,370
BMW.

197
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:53,393
Yes.
-Really? -Yes.

198
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:58,500
Thanks a lot, Anekta!
I love you so much.

199
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,435
I love you too.

200
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:15,392
So Shu our show is 'Kabhi
Yeh Kabhi Woh'.

201
00:13:19,398 --> 00:13:22,424
And your have around 52 episodes...

202
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,361
to improve its TRP.

203
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:31,470
Put new ideas,
change storyline and actors.

204
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,472
But revive this show.

205
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:40,352
If in 52 episodes we succeed
in increasing...

206
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,319
the TRP of this show...

207
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:46,322
then moon TV can't move
us from prime time.

208
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,449
And we'll win the challenge.

209
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,387
And they'll get a befitting reply
of their threatening letter.

210
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,496
And you'll get 5 million
reward from me.

211
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,337
Anekta Kapoor hasn't
left anything.

212
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,304
Extra-marital affair. Done.

213
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,434
Rebirth. Done.

214
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,470
Supernatural, ruse in families,
plastic surgery...

215
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:09,403
rape, murder...

216
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:12,246
everything is covered...

217
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,320
in many serials for
thousand of times.

218
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,320
What has she left for me?

219
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,382
Son Subrojit...

220
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:30,334
you won't win this time.

221
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,436
Hi.

222
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:46,308
Hello.
-Hello.

223
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:49,444
You came to stay in Lalaji flats.

224
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:51,278
Yes.

225
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:54,449
Fantastic. Then it'll be fun.
-Why?

226
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,431
I mean to say,
myself Miss TV Mirchandani.

227
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,389
Miss...

228
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:04,427
How could I miss that?

229
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,497
I'm Subrojit Chakravarty.

230
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:12,467
very pleased to meet you
Mr. Subrojit Chakravarty.

231
00:15:14,313 --> 00:15:15,302
Subro is fine.

232
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,472
I'll call you Subo.

233
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,318
You came to live in Lalaji
telefims' flat.

234
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:23,285
It mean you must be
a big gun there.

235
00:15:23,355 --> 00:15:26,290
Not, I'm a small pistol.

236
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:27,381
New creative head.

237
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,286
My God! Tell me, will Antara
give birth to son or a bot?

238
00:15:31,463 --> 00:15:33,294
I'm sorry. I didn't get it.

239
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:38,267
Tell me, who is the real
father of her child?

240
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,295
I won't tell anyone.

241
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,309
I don't even know Antara,
how can I say?

242
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,434
You don't know Antara.
-No.

243
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,471
You must know Pragya.

244
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,475
Ok, when is Pragya's second
husband marrying...

245
00:15:52,518 --> 00:15:55,385
her 3rd husband's 2nd wife?

246
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:59,518
Actually I'm new in this city.

247
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,419
I don't know Antara and Pragya.

248
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:07,297
Do you really work in
Lalaji telefilms?

249
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,425
Yes, I live in their flat
so I work there.

250
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,498
Then you know Pragya of
'Kahani Ulfat Ki'...

251
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:17,365
and Antara of
'Iska Kasur Uske Sar'.

252
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,370
Sorry, actually I've joined
yesterday so...

253
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,278
I don't know anything
besides my show.

254
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,375
You're new?
-Yes. -Ok.

255
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:29,353
I'll tell you what's the problem
in which program.

256
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:33,255
First in your serial,
'Kabhi Yeh Kabhi Woh'...

257
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,393
is boring.
Do something about it.

258
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:39,294
Or I'll stop watching that
program. I warn you.

259
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:41,424
Now I must go.
I'm getting late for office.

260
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,331
See you later.
-Ok.

261
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,438
I'm your neighbour.

262
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:49,433
But come at day. Not at night.
-Why?

263
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,378
Because at night
I watch TV programs.

264
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,312
How sweet!
-Thank you.

265
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:58,372
Bye.
-Halt.

266
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,485
Don't move. Hello.

267
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,481
I m Karuna Sindhur agatpati.

268
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,414
Secretary of this society.

269
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,394
One more mockery in the
name of humanity.

270
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,288
Did you say anything?

271
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:15,391
Yes. What a name?

272
00:17:16,268 --> 00:17:17,257
Suits you!

273
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,268
I'm Subrojit Chakravarty
and I must go.

274
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,241
I know.

275
00:17:24,343 --> 00:17:27,335
You're not married,
you must be having affairs.

276
00:17:29,314 --> 00:17:30,440
Excuse me. What?

277
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:33,442
Because your name means that...

278
00:17:34,286 --> 00:17:37,255
Chakravarty.

279
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,290
Your name is agapati so are
you husband of every woman.

280
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,381
Nonsense.

281
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,320
I'm still a bachelor.

282
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,301
But I want to marry one.

283
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:54,396
Listen carefully.

284
00:17:57,276 --> 00:17:58,368
You live alone.
-Yes.

285
00:17:59,311 --> 00:18:00,369
So don't make any din.

286
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:03,312
No parties.

287
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:06,375
Don't bring girls.

288
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:12,246
And don't try to peep
at neighbours.

289
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,247
My God.

290
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,285
Madam, in a tight close up...

291
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,321
Sorry, this was too much.

292
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,321
In close up...

293
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:25,301
Rashmi looks into Raj's
eyes and says...

294
00:18:25,471 --> 00:18:28,372
Raj,
don't you remember anything.

295
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,434
That paper boat. That rain water...

296
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,437
waiting at bus stop.

297
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,438
Writing letters secretly.

298
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,407
Looking into eyes...
-No!

299
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,419
Utter nonsense. Totally rubbish!

300
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,416
It's mythological melodrama.

301
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,417
Of ancient times.

302
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,258
Do youngsters talk like this?

303
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,296
They talk half in English
and half in Hindi.

304
00:18:54,399 --> 00:18:56,424
I want Hinglish, man.

305
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:01,268
But madam, the girl from village
will talk in Hindi?

306
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:05,299
Shut up! I said,
who is the EP of this show?

307
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:07,378
Yes, madam.

308
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:11,347
Tomorrow morning at 3,
meet me with this writer.

309
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,317
I'll dictate all the dialogues
of this show.

310
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,276
Ok, madam.

311
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,354
So Shu,
what about our story track?

312
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,263
Any new development.
-Yes.

313
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,364
About our lead protagonist...

314
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,400
I've thought of a new track.

315
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,471
What's the track? Tell me.

316
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:46,307
I think we can incorporate a
nice emotional track here.

317
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,374
We'll...

318
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:49,345
No, no, no.

319
00:19:50,422 --> 00:19:55,450
Glycerin bill is more than
petrol bill of my car.

320
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,397
Shu,
let's do something new and diff.

321
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:03,501
Think, Shu. And think fast.

322
00:20:04,336 --> 00:20:06,327
Because you don't have much time.

323
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:16,277
Miss Mirchandani, what's going on?

324
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,476
I'm watching a serial.
-Come in. I'll show you.

325
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,343
I'm fine here.
My brains is at place too.

326
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:24,287
Do you know your din is disturbing
the entire building?

327
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,323
Can't you lower the
volume of your TV?

328
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:31,352
How can I? I spend money to
buy such nice speakers.

329
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,523
If I lower the volume,
how can I listen to the dialogue?

330
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,426
Your ear needs to be treated.

331
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,402
You treat your brains.

332
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,432
If I don't watch serials,
how will I live?

333
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,338
It's futile to talk to you.

334
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:47,311
So don't talk to me.

335
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,271
Dear!

336
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,512
She's strange!

337
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,265
Good... good morning.

338
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:21,468
Are you done?

339
00:21:22,481 --> 00:21:25,382
What... I didn't get it.

340
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,311
If you like to stare,
wear dark glasses.

341
00:21:30,489 --> 00:21:35,392
If you ogle like this you'll
get whacked someday.

342
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,429
Excuse me,
you're getting me wrong. I was...

343
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:41,330
I wasn't staring you. I was just...

344
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,269
Actually...
-What?

345
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:45,425
Whom were you staring?

346
00:21:45,537 --> 00:21:48,506
There is nobody else here.
Obviously you were staring me.

347
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:51,342
Look, you...

348
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,405
You're right.
I was looking at you.

349
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,407
Actually you're so beautiful...

350
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,350
forgive the mistake of my eyes.

351
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,449
Filmy?
-No. Not filmy...

352
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:09,416
slightly diff.

353
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,284
Television.

354
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,454
I do serials. TV serials.

355
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:16,366
No wonder!
It's all one and the same.

356
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,402
But you're just known differently.

357
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:20,405
Yes, because we're so confident.

358
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,297
Yes... no. I think you're too loud.

359
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:31,346
Anyway, I'm Subrojit Chakravarty.

360
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,439
I'm Sumona Rai.

361
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,447
You're Bengali.
-You're too.

362
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:40,484
Brahmin. Where do you stay?
-Baliganj.

363
00:22:41,393 --> 00:22:43,327
And if you talk to in Hindi
it will be nice.

364
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:44,453
I'm practicing to talk in Hindi.

365
00:22:44,496 --> 00:22:46,327
Yes, sure. Why not?

366
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,423
So you're from South Kolkatta.

367
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,493
All the snobs of Kolkatta
live there.

368
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,428
No wonder you're so hot...
I mean angry.

369
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:56,372
You mean I'm a snob
and hot-headed.

370
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,376
Yes.
-Where do you stay?

371
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,444
I think in Nupur.
Excuse me.

372
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:04,282
Shyam Bazar.
Proper Kolkatta. Real Kolkatta.

373
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,441
What's your South Kolkatta?

374
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,419
Some years ago it was a forest
of foxes. Now owls are there.

375
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:10,480
And your North Kolkatta?

376
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:13,324
All are wild and ill mannered.

377
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:15,416
Whether it's Manhattan or Mumbai,
they won't change.

378
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:18,361
Excuse me.
How did I misbehave with you?

379
00:23:18,463 --> 00:23:20,431
Such attitude.
Such temperament. Why?

380
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:25,269
First of all,
don't scare me with your big eyes.

381
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,440
And secondly,
don't talk as if I'm an old lady.

382
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,309
And thirdly...

383
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,433
this is your car?

384
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,405
You stand in front of such
a big car and... -Wait.

385
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,438
Excuse me.

386
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:41,441
Sit, madam.

387
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,317
Where can I drop you?

388
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,479
That's better.

389
00:23:48,293 --> 00:23:49,282
Yes.

390
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:52,497
So like an ideal Indian woman...

391
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,332
you too must be watching
TV serials?

392
00:23:55,467 --> 00:23:59,335
No. I'm not so ideal to
watch those junks.

393
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,407
God!

394
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:04,308
You're Bengali.

395
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:07,273
And you don't watch TV serials.
So what do you watch?

396
00:24:07,312 --> 00:24:08,279
Football match.

397
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:13,280
No, I watch news, not serials.

398
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,278
And I don't like all this rubbish!
Yours...

399
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:21,281
listless, homeless, serial
soaps, every soaps.

400
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,327
I don't like them.
-Thank you.

401
00:24:24,362 --> 00:24:27,297
By the way, I know the time
when your office starts.

402
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,364
Tell me,
when should I pick you up?

403
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,437
America?

404
00:24:32,504 --> 00:24:37,373
You show America in Indian
sentiments in your daily soaps.

405
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:40,306
They wear Indian attires.

406
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,504
But they act like Americans.

407
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:46,441
I mean, one woman marries 5 times.
5 husbands.

408
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:50,412
And those husbands have so many
things... it's so disgusting.

409
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,286
Come on, Sumana.
These things works nowadays.

410
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:56,383
All the ladies are glued to TV
to watch this. What can we do?

411
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,463
And that's why you glorify it...

412
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:02,357
in the name of sacrifice
so that all...

413
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,425
the stupid women tread
on that path.

414
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,371
What an example you're setting
so the society?

415
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:10,374
I mean... nonsense.

416
00:25:13,411 --> 00:25:16,312
Sumana, all the channels,
production houses...

417
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,283
are here for business. Money.

418
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,412
If they show agriculture programs
and documentaries...

419
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,251
on Indian toilet system...

420
00:25:24,422 --> 00:25:26,413
then who will watch
our channels.

421
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,261
Anyway, you're aware towards
the society and country.

422
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:32,362
Tell me,
what program should be show?

423
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:34,465
Please give me your valuable
suggestion.

424
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,401
What and why should I tell you?

425
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:39,403
Come on.

426
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:42,463
You're creative head of the
biggest production house of India.

427
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,409
So you should think of that.

428
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,312
What can I think and say to you?

429
00:25:48,346 --> 00:25:52,282
I mean...
show the truth of a common man.

430
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,315
Maybe your work will be done.

431
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,385
You...
-Shut up! Just shut up!

432
00:26:02,427 --> 00:26:03,416
Listen, you...

433
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:08,264
What are you trying to do
in my society, villain?

434
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,355
Excuse me.

435
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,370
First of all you push me in my
house and then you accuse me.

436
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,428
What am I doing?
-Listen.

437
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,365
Don't try to act smart.
-What?

438
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:18,433
I told you earlier...

439
00:26:19,377 --> 00:26:22,278
my society is a clean society.

440
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:23,440
Neat and clean.

441
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:25,442
What were you doing
with that girl?

442
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,417
That... that girl.

443
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,487
She too is clean.
She bathes everyday.

444
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,311
Of course. Yes.

445
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,258
Listen.
Don't try to trick me with words.

446
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:36,393
What are you doing with that girl?

447
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,293
Affair?
-Just hold on please.

448
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:41,260
I'm having an affair...

449
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,358
but the thing...

450
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:47,405
that you're doing with
Mirchandani, what's that.

451
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:51,242
Mirchandani? -Yes.
-What are you talking about?

452
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:54,411
Miss Mirchandani.

453
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,436
Excuse me.

454
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,312
Look, you may be old...

455
00:26:59,484 --> 00:27:01,315
but I'm not less experienced.

456
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,444
Don't do that.

457
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:06,416
I'll do something like
your wild beasts.

458
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:10,393
By the way, how long have you
been trying to woo her?

459
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,453
For many days.

460
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,392
For many days?
Yet nothing happened.

461
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:21,432
Don't worry. I'm here. Something
will happen now.

462
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,276
Thank you.

463
00:27:25,343 --> 00:27:26,401
It's ok.
-Thank you very much.

464
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:57,467
Help me, God! Please.

465
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:00,311
Excuse me.

466
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:20,262
What? What do you mean?

467
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,391
Miss Mirchandani. What's this?

468
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,401
What are you doing in my house
at this time in fancy dress?

469
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:27,295
You just called me.

470
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,463
I didn't call you.

471
00:28:29,274 --> 00:28:31,299
Just now you prayed to God...
-That...

472
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:40,279
Why are you laughing?

473
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,376
Why are you laughing?

474
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:47,323
My mother said that if I work
for TV, I'll go mad.

475
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:50,291
I've gone mad. So I'm laughing.

476
00:28:50,462 --> 00:28:52,487
I'm your audience. TRP.

477
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:55,332
I'm like a God to you.

478
00:28:56,301 --> 00:29:00,362
Actually God has given
TV department to me.

479
00:29:01,306 --> 00:29:05,367
It's not easy for God to
understand your TV programs.

480
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,343
So I came to answer your prayers.

481
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:14,247
It could be true too.

482
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,420
I shouldn't take chance. No, you...

483
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:20,286
Why don't you sit down?

484
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,418
Please come.
Will you've something hot or cold?

485
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:25,292
I'm very busy today.

486
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,332
I've to go to the people
of other channels too.

487
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,331
They too are crying just like you.

488
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,300
Tell me, what do you want?

489
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,241
Mother... mother, have mercy on me.

490
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,241
Give me some idea. Please.

491
00:29:41,346 --> 00:29:45,373
Give me such an idea that your
position improves in my serial.

492
00:29:45,483 --> 00:29:48,350
TRP should sky-rocket. Please.

493
00:29:50,321 --> 00:29:52,380
You're stuck in the
plot of serial.

494
00:29:54,325 --> 00:29:57,419
Everything will be fine.
I'll handle that.

495
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:00,464
Just apply oil and go to sleep.

496
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:01,487
Ok?

497
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,477
Now...

498
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:17,405
I got it, mother.

499
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:20,506
First, madam...

500
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,357
Hello.
-Hello, madam.

501
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:33,453
Madam, I got the idea.

502
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:37,359
I'll narrate the first episode
of 52 episodes tomorrow.

503
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,429
It's already tomorrow. It's 5 am.

504
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:45,342
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

505
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:48,309
Actually I was so excited...

506
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:50,504
in my dreams...
I mean I thought of such an idea...

507
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,374
that I called you without
looking at the time. I'm sorry.

508
00:30:53,484 --> 00:30:54,473
No problem.

509
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,317
If you want you came meet me now.

510
00:30:57,388 --> 00:30:59,322
I'm ready for work all the time.

511
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,381
No, madam.

512
00:31:02,327 --> 00:31:03,351
There is some problem.

513
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:07,420
It depends on a lots of
interesting factor.

514
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,456
So it'll take time to develop,
but...

515
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:13,463
Tomorrow...
I mean today during the day...

516
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,341
...I'll narrate you the first
episode. Definitely. Positively.

517
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,477
Hi.

518
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,421
I... I said hi.

519
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:35,426
Excuse me. You're talking to me.

520
00:31:39,297 --> 00:31:42,460
No.
I was talking to these buttons.

521
00:31:43,301 --> 00:31:44,359
Of course I said hi to you.

522
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:48,268
I mean, why are you pulling
my legs in the morning?

523
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,497
Did I say something wrong?

524
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:54,500
Do I know you.

525
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:03,351
Subro, what's the problem?

526
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:07,415
Let me... -Let me...
-Let me explain.

527
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:11,394
You're making the mistake
which others make.

528
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,490
What?
-I'm not Subro.

529
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,297
Subro is my elder brother.

530
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,266
He's elder to me by a minute.

531
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,302
59 seconds to be precise.

532
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,304
I'm Obrojit Chakravarty.

533
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:26,340
I came from Kolkatta last night.

534
00:32:27,312 --> 00:32:28,279
Are you fooling me?

535
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,473
Look, madam. We neither talk
casually on first meeting...

536
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:37,477
nor fool anyone
as you just said.

537
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,453
Ok, I mean you...

538
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:47,491
May I know your name please?

539
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,290
Sumana.

540
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:54,428
Charming! Good day.

541
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,370
You know what Sangeeta...

542
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,305
...I can't believe it.

543
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:09,419
Twins could be so identical?

544
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,318
And it's not even a film.

545
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,416
It's possible.

546
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:17,323
But I think he's pulling your leg.

547
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:18,452
I really hope not.

548
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:22,492
Because if he's doing this,
I'll whack him up.

549
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:29,440
But why would he do so?

550
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,303
He'll know it better.

551
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:35,378
By the way, tell me did Subro
phone you today? -No.

552
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,503
Not even once.

553
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,409
Then why don't you phone
him and meet him.

554
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,345
But his brother Obrojit told
me that he's shooting.

555
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:50,358
It means you believed him that
they're twin brothers.

556
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:52,395
Thank you.
-Ok, sorry.

557
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,295
Don't be angry. And phone Subro.

558
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:57,492
New plot is coming.
Just hear me out.

559
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,337
Now we'll show that Savitr's
daughter, Rimjhim has grown up.

560
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,235
She's doing a job.

561
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,467
She lives alone in a
flat in Lokhandwala.

562
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,343
Now we've to find
a logic why she...

563
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,278
lives alone leaving her family.

564
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,503
Come on, Shu.

565
00:34:11,282 --> 00:34:15,446
If we get trapped by logic, we
can't make a serial. -Of course.

566
00:34:15,486 --> 00:34:18,353
Now Rimjhim lives alone
because it's my wish.

567
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:19,447
I mean it's her wish.

568
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,479
Go on.

569
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,350
Fantastic. Problem solved.

570
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:26,363
Now here our hero Rohit enters.

571
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:28,421
Hello, boss.

572
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,400
Rohit comes to say in the
same building as Rimjhim.

573
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,361
In a flat on the 5th floor.

574
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,399
And then Rohit and Rimjhim
meet in a lift.

575
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:43,471
Now Rimjhim and Rohit come closer.

576
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,418
What they couldn't say,
they read in each other's eyes.

577
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,387
Then one day,
Rohit thinks of a prank.

578
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,458
On the second day when Rimjhim
and Rohit meet in the lift...

579
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,403
Rimjhim smiles and greets him.

580
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:08,464
Just say please.
-Good morning.

581
00:35:08,506 --> 00:35:09,473
Yes.

582
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:11,275
Do I know you?

583
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,474
But Rohit refuses
to recognize her.

584
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:22,317
And says he's not are but Mohit,
his twin brother...

585
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,320
who came from Delhi last night.

586
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,414
Excellent.

587
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,349
Excellent.

588
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:35,421
Hello.

589
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:38,427
Hi, Subro.
Where are you? What are you doing?

590
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,334
How could I answer the phone?

591
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,463
I was getting ideas
from real life.

592
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:44,366
I mean, I was busy with shooting.

593
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,310
Where are you?

594
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:47,435
Ideas comes by themselves.

595
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,446
It doesn't inform before coming.

596
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:51,437
That's how Ooro is.

597
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,339
He too comes.

598
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,385
Anyway, he can't live without me.

599
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,512
He was offered a good job here.

600
00:35:58,422 --> 00:35:59,411
He just dropped in.

601
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,485
But you never told me.

602
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,360
I've not told you many things,
Sumana.

603
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:06,487
What?
-I mean...

604
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,366
you didn't give me a
chance to tell you.

605
00:36:10,434 --> 00:36:13,232
You always talk about
me and my TV serials.

606
00:36:13,404 --> 00:36:16,373
Because Sumana hates TV serials.
-Right.

607
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:18,342
And...

608
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,402
What about TV personnel?

609
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:32,444
What a timing?

610
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:35,324
Think of the devil... Ooro.

611
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,350
Yes, brother?

612
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,431
Sir, you told me to phone after
half and hour so I phoned.

613
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,361
Yes, I heard.
In the lift in the morning.

614
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,363
Lift? What are you saying, sir?

615
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:52,374
So? Lift?

616
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:55,279
Lift?

617
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:57,314
Sir, I think you're not well.

618
00:36:58,482 --> 00:37:01,349
That mobile is a gift from me.

619
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:02,474
Gift?

620
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,323
Thank you, sir.

621
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:07,482
Can I go home now, sir?

622
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:11,455
No. Wait. Wait there.

623
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,388
I'll call you after half an hour.

624
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:16,466
Ok. Ok, sir.
-Yes.

625
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,425
Crazy.

626
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,301
Sorry.
-No problem.

627
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,308
So ladies. What's the program now?

628
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,377
Of course, we'll go home.
-Fantastic.

629
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:28,412
So then...

630
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:30,436
Can I drop you?

631
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:32,474
I'll drop Sangeeta too on the way.

632
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,411
Keep the laptop.

633
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:44,485
Where is the mobile?

634
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:47,421
Here, sir. Near my heart.

635
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,390
I've kept it carefully.

636
00:37:49,467 --> 00:37:50,456
Don't worry.

637
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:52,393
I don't care for your heart.

638
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,460
Give me the mobile back.

639
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:56,330
Ramji, give me the mobile.

640
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,314
Go and close the door.
-What, sir?

641
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,349
Close the door. Don't just stand.

642
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:11,287
No, sir. I'm not like that.

643
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,281
You're getting me wrong.
-What do you mean?

644
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:17,361
I swear...
-Ramji, what are you doing?

645
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,226
I don't want to work.
-Why?

646
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,424
Wherever I go in Mumbai city...

647
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,268
I find such males. What to say?

648
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,270
No, no, no.

649
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,306
-Ramji, you're getting me wrong.
-No, sir.

650
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,498
Look... -I can't work here.
-Ramji.

651
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,402
Look, relax.
-No, sir. -Listen.

652
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,279
I want to talk to you.
So I told you to close the door.

653
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:41,246
I too am not like that. Ok?

654
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,378
Sir...
-It's about these 2 mobiles.

655
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,322
This is of Subro and
this is of Ooro.

656
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,318
Relax.

657
00:38:54,298 --> 00:38:55,287
Take this.

658
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,370
No,
this is for mobile, nothing else.

659
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,336
Ok, sir.
-Go.

660
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,373
Go.
-Greetings.

661
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,442
No!

662
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,278
Uncle, please.

663
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:10,439
Uncle, someone might hear you.
Please.

664
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:12,449
Ok.
-Control.

665
00:39:13,517 --> 00:39:17,248
But what a fantastic drama?
-Thanks.

666
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:21,384
But please,
I need your help in this and...

667
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,416
it's a top secret.
-Don't worry.

668
00:39:24,428 --> 00:39:26,453
I'm with you in this war.

669
00:39:27,331 --> 00:39:29,356
And being the secretary
of the society...

670
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,401
I'll take care that
the watchman...

671
00:39:32,436 --> 00:39:35,337
sweeper and house keeper
of building join you too.

672
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:36,440
You're...

673
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,331
Good. Thank you.

674
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,436
May I?
-Come in.

675
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,474
All right. Everything is ready.

676
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,447
From 15th of next month
we'll start shooting.

677
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,382
We want at least 10 episodes
ready for shooting.

678
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:59,328
But, madam...
hero and heroine aren't finalized.

679
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,260
How can we shoot on 15th?

680
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,491
Hero and heroine are cast.

681
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:05,357
You don't worry.

682
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:08,428
Hero and heroine of
my show are cast.

683
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,500
Strange! I didn't even meet them.

684
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:13,501
But of course, you've cast them.

685
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:16,336
They must be fantastic. I'm sure.

686
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,317
No, Shu. I didn't cast them.

687
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:22,452
Astrologers...

688
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:26,481
tarot card reader,
Feng Shui experts...

689
00:40:26,524 --> 00:40:28,424
all of them cast them.

690
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,385
And Shu, you know...

691
00:40:31,395 --> 00:40:34,455
that casting at our place
are done by them.

692
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,289
Hello.

693
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:43,371
So how do they look?
-You must've obviously seen them.

694
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,500
Shu, I saw the girl's
photo at the betel...

695
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:47,511
leaf shop in front
of our office.

696
00:40:48,379 --> 00:40:49,505
It was on the poster
of a tobacco ad.

697
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,408
Looking at her I feel
that she must...

698
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,443
be the new heroine of our show.

699
00:40:57,421 --> 00:41:00,390
When we asked the ad
agency they said...

700
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,255
her name starts with 'K' too.

701
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:07,329
And our priests did the rest
by matching her horoscope.

702
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:14,326
And the hero came to deliver
pizza in our office.

703
00:41:14,505 --> 00:41:16,473
Name of pizza company
was 'Kamino'.

704
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:19,332
And the name of pizza
deliver bot was...

705
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:20,365
Kushal Kurdikar.

706
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,411
Now tell me, Shu...

707
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:26,408
how could I let so many
'K's slip from my hands?

708
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:27,506
Why not? Very nice.

709
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:30,319
So Kanekta...

710
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:32,379
I mean Anekta...

711
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:34,480
acting...

712
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,381
What's that?

713
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,395
That...
-I mean it will be done.

714
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:42,422
But the real thing is that
their horoscopes...

715
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,333
matches mine as well as yours.

716
00:41:45,402 --> 00:41:46,369
Really?

717
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:52,501
Shu, now our TRP of our
serial will skyrocket.

718
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,336
Just concentrate on writing.
I'll do the rest.

719
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,448
Great. You've done everything.

720
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,342
Thank you.

721
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,445
Shu, wait. Sit.

722
00:42:05,289 --> 00:42:08,486
Shu, until 52 episodes of our
serials aren't completed...

723
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,319
you should eat pumpkin
and gourd.

724
00:42:13,397 --> 00:42:16,457
And in breakfast you can eat
dry fruits and snacks too.

725
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,423
Ok.

726
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:22,396
Can I eat 'Khari' ( cookie )?

727
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:25,502
Shu, how can you eat Khari?

728
00:42:26,343 --> 00:42:29,369
K... KHARI, khari.

729
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,284
Ok. Fine. You can eat it.

730
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:36,508
Khank you.

731
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:38,410
I mean thank you.

732
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:40,512
Bye.

733
00:42:41,425 --> 00:42:43,518
What? Mohan Bagan won.

734
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,488
very good.
East Bengal knows nothing.

735
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:48,487
Hi, Sumana.
-Hi.

736
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:54,431
Sir. Your elder brother told me
that he'd to leave suddenly.

737
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,438
You were sleeping so he
didn't wake you up.

738
00:42:56,473 --> 00:42:57,462
Ok. Thank you.

739
00:42:59,376 --> 00:43:00,468
Ok.

740
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:02,334
How is your new job?

741
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:06,281
New job?
But I still work for Lalaji.

742
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:07,472
Why?

743
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:10,445
No, you Subro... Ooro...

744
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:13,381
You're confused like the watchman.

745
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:14,479
He thinks I'm Ooro.

746
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:16,485
Don't mind. Shall we?

747
00:43:17,328 --> 00:43:18,386
Yes, sure.

748
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,427
Ok, which company has Ooro joined?

749
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,272
Ooro...

750
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,464
He told me something...

751
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,468
Hey, what a coincidence?

752
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,344
He has joined this company.
upiter Pharmaceuticals.

753
00:43:38,382 --> 00:43:41,317
So he too works in the
field of Pharmaceuticals.

754
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:44,344
No. He has a mental problem.
He goes to take medicine.

755
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:46,480
Good.
-What?

756
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,449
I mean, nice joke.

757
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:54,363
Actually I was thinking
of changing my job.

758
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:59,298
And if he's in the same field,
he can help me. Right?

759
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,272
Yeah. Of course. Why not?

760
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,400
Can you talk to him for me?
-No.

761
00:44:06,377 --> 00:44:08,436
I mean, come on.
Are you joking, Sumana?

762
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,369
You've met.

763
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,278
You can talk to him.

764
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,317
Call him and... but...

765
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,385
please call him during
lunch hours.

766
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:18,311
Because he's very busy.

767
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,414
Or else he won't even answer
the phone. He's rising up.

768
00:44:30,467 --> 00:44:32,264
Obrojit Chakravarty here.

769
00:44:32,403 --> 00:44:34,371
Hi, Ooro. This is Sumana here.

770
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:37,296
Sumana? Who?

771
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:40,272
Sumana!

772
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,378
Hi, Sumana. What a surprise!

773
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,278
Rohit has created Mohit's
character very wisely.

774
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,445
Rohit is very sophisticated,
soft spoken and romantic.

775
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:54,290
But Mohit is very candid.
Sarcastic.

776
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:55,449
You've an important work.

777
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,359
You can't tell me on the phone.

778
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,364
It'll be better if we could
meet personally.

779
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:03,458
Only for a few minutes.

780
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,359
Ok. Then where can we meet?

781
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:08,334
Rimjhim was waiting for Mohit.

782
00:45:08,405 --> 00:45:10,464
Mohit enters café at 4:30.

783
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:16,336
Hi, Sumana. How are you?

784
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:17,437
I'm fine. How are you?

785
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,371
Curious.

786
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,385
You phoned me suddenly so...

787
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,347
By the way,
how did you get my phone number?

788
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,292
Your elder brother Subrojit
gave me. -I see.

789
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:36,262
Actually I wanted to...

790
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:39,302
You called me only
for introduction.

791
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:41,336
You called me only
for introduction.

792
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,340
No.

793
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,310
It's not so. I need your help.

794
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:50,502
My help?

795
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,440
Come on, Sumana.
I'm new in this city.

796
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,340
How can I help you?

797
00:45:56,353 --> 00:46:00,289
Subro can help you.
-No, Ooro. Only you can help me.

798
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,346
Now a new drama.

799
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:04,292
Rimjhim tells Mohit that she
wants to change the job.

800
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,295
And she needs Mohit's help.

801
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,456
Obviously Mohit agrees.

802
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,287
Yes. Why not?

803
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,401
Give me your résumé.
I'll forward it to my CEO.

804
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:15,396
No, I'll come personally in your
office to give my résumé.

805
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,467
This way I can see
your office too.

806
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:23,402
No. No. No.

807
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:25,482
No problem. No problem.

808
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,351
Now Mohit didn't expect this.

809
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,413
He gets stuck. He gets tense.

810
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,348
But yet he handles the situation.

811
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:36,416
When can I come?

812
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:38,416
And where?

813
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,421
Do you've any visiting card?

814
00:46:43,367 --> 00:46:46,268
Actually I've just joined so...

815
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,336
sitting cards aren't printed Yet.

816
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,466
Ok.
-You're coming to office.

817
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,278
So I'll give you visiting
card tomorrow.

818
00:46:56,513 --> 00:46:59,277
Here we'll freeze the episode.

819
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:02,477
We've hooked the viewers here.

820
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,488
And viewers will be tense
thinking how...

821
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,389
will Mohit get the visiting card.

822
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,258
You wrote in your email
that you want...

823
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,265
to shoot in our office premise.

824
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,390
It's good news.

825
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:19,360
So you watch serials?

826
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:22,372
I don't, but my wife watches them.
-Fantastic.

827
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:26,432
Tell me, what will we get if we
give you permission to shoot.

828
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,403
Of course,
besides pleasing my wife.

829
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,406
Our young hero...

830
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:36,350
let's suppose he's a marketing
manager in your company.

831
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:41,280
During office scenes he'll
talk about your products.

832
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:42,347
And of course...

833
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:44,417
logo of your company will
be visible in every frame.

834
00:47:45,295 --> 00:47:46,319
Yes!

835
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:50,422
No problem. I'm going to UK
on 10th for a convention.

836
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,434
Great!
-But I'll give the instructions.

837
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,300
You can shoot whenever you want.

838
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:56,339
Right, sir? Well...

839
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,498
By the way, Mr. Chakravarty...

840
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:01,306
will their be any role for
my wife in your serial?

841
00:48:02,346 --> 00:48:05,281
Her left profile is
just like Tulsi...

842
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,417
and right profile
is like Parvati.

843
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,479
And front profile?

844
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:13,411
Maybe like Granny.

845
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:17,351
And your name is Om Bajaj.
What a coincidence!

846
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,422
I'll take your leave, sir.

847
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:25,461
By the way, can I get one visiting
cards of yours? -Sure.

848
00:48:57,401 --> 00:49:01,428
Sir, your elder brother said
that he'll come late.

849
00:49:02,339 --> 00:49:04,330
He was sleeping that's why
he didn't disturb you.

850
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,375
Ok. Thank you.

851
00:49:06,476 --> 00:49:07,443
Listen.

852
00:49:08,345 --> 00:49:09,403
This watchman is strange.

853
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,438
He still can't differentiate
between you two.

854
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,317
He still thinks you're Ooro.

855
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,276
You know why?

856
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,381
Because I'm Ooro.

857
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,419
Wait.
You asked for my visiting card.

858
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,387
Yeah.
-It's printed.

859
00:49:28,332 --> 00:49:30,266
Here.
I'll tell you when you can come.

860
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,323
Yeah.

861
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,303
By the way, I'm in a hurry.
Can I drop you somewhere?

862
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:37,371
And here 10th episode freezes.

863
00:49:38,007 --> 00:49:39,236
Shu!

864
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:40,469
You've worked magic.

865
00:49:41,378 --> 00:49:43,471
Now we can go to 15th Floor.

866
00:49:43,513 --> 00:49:45,276
God! Thank you.

867
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,474
Or else I would've been floored.

868
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,478
Come on! Clap for Shu!
-Yeah!

869
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:55,450
Are you done?
-What?

870
00:49:57,294 --> 00:50:01,253
If you like to stare at girls,
you should wear dark glasses.

871
00:50:01,431 --> 00:50:05,390
Or else some day you'll
be whacked.

872
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,436
Cut.
Why are these flower pots here.

873
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,431
What?
-Anekta, move these pots.

874
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,372
Don't worry.
They're not in the field.

875
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,445
Whatever. If I said it, get it done.
-Of course.

876
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,378
vinay, come.
-Yes, sir.

877
00:50:18,415 --> 00:50:21,282
Who kept those pots there?
Move them.

878
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,440
But...
-Move them.

879
00:50:23,286 --> 00:50:24,275
Ok, sir.

880
00:50:24,454 --> 00:50:26,479
Setting! Move those pots.

881
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,326
Don't worry. Relax.
I'll handle it. -Ok.

882
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:31,416
Ok. Come with me.

883
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:36,421
Sir, who was she?

884
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:40,394
Channels Executive producer.
-Really?

885
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,404
Sir,
why did she said to move the pots?

886
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:43,496
They weren't in the frame.

887
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,408
It's helplessness.
-What?

888
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:52,278
If the channel finds out things
get done without her help...

889
00:50:52,615 --> 00:50:55,375
She'll lose her job.
-Right, sir.

890
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:57,442
Ok.
-Go.

891
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:06,284
Sumana calling Ooro.

892
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:08,286
Next episode is here.

893
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,367
If she hears the shooting sound...

894
00:51:17,507 --> 00:51:19,407
Hi, Sumana.
-Hi, Ooro.

895
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:26,306
I phoned to ask when can I give
my résumé to your CEO.

896
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:31,285
Just hold on.
I'll check his schedule first.

897
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:35,451
Yes, fine. Why don't you come on...

898
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:38,450
20th.

899
00:51:38,495 --> 00:51:41,328
Ok. I'll come, Ooro. Thanks.

900
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,454
You're welcome.

901
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:54,271
Back to...

902
00:51:58,315 --> 00:51:59,339
Hi.
-Hi.

903
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:03,475
Subro, are you busy?
-Yes, I'm on shooting. Very busy.

904
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:08,280
I phoned to tell you that
I talked to Ooro...

905
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:11,486
and he called me on 20th to
his office to meet his CEO.

906
00:52:12,262 --> 00:52:13,456
Really? That's so sweet of him.

907
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:16,365
You know Ooro is very sweet.

908
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:19,267
He's better than me.
-Yes, I can see that.

909
00:52:19,436 --> 00:52:21,461
By the way when will
you return home?

910
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,406
Disgusting! I hate it.

911
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:34,372
God!

912
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:37,479
You know you're making
me passive smoker too.

913
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,482
You know the pollution
level of this city.

914
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,358
Non-smokers too live
like heavy smokers.

915
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:46,417
Ok.

916
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:52,492
You know I like one
thing about Ooro.

917
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:54,370
He doesn't smoke.

918
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,404
He could. How would you know?

919
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,309
At least he doesn't smoke
in front of me.

920
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,278
And he's decent enough not to
smoke in front of a lady.

921
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,437
I accept that.

922
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,410
Ooro is very decent. Disciplined.

923
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:14,388
By the way, be careful. Reach on
time on 20th in his office.

924
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:17,350
Don't worry. I'll be there.
-Come on. It's time.

925
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:19,394
Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

926
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:20,453
Is it ready?
-Yes, sir.

927
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,431
Who is CEO?
-Sir, he'll play it.

928
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,489
Good.
-Hello.

929
00:53:25,302 --> 00:53:26,360
Dialogues.
-I remember, sir.

930
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:28,371
Hello. I'm just leaving.

931
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,429
Good. Very good. Leave.

932
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:31,433

-Yes, sir.

933
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,400
Just remember...
-Yes.

934
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:37,503
This... before our heroine
Rimjhim and Rohit enter...

935
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:40,383
there is a first scene. Ok?
-Yes.

936
00:53:40,483 --> 00:53:43,384
We'll show the maze of the office.
-Yes, sir.

937
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,445
A character will come. Sumana.
Small character. -Yes, sir.

938
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,412
She'll meet CEO.

939
00:53:47,457 --> 00:53:50,426
We'll just establish that
CEO is very busy. -Ok.

940
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:53,325
But sir,
who will play marketing manager?

941
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:56,298
You didn't introduce that artist.

942
00:53:58,301 --> 00:53:59,290
I'll play it.

943
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,427
His name will be Obrojit.

944
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:03,369
I'm Subrojit, he'll be Obrojit.

945
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,498
You, sir? Fantastic.

946
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:07,435
I already said that you've

947
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,341
You should play the lead role.

948
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,414
If you say in other serial
lead role for you...

949
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:15,273
Ok, sir.

950
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,344
By the way, the character of
Sumana who comes for interview...

951
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:19,377
She's a new girl.

952
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,417
Listen. -Yes.
-Don't do her make up.

953
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:23,448
Yes.
-Ok?

954
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,420
We'll try candid. very natural.
-Ok.

955
00:54:26,463 --> 00:54:28,363
She shouldn't know we're
shooting her.

956
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:30,389
Or she'll become conscious.
-Right? -Yes.

957
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:35,328
It means just like Satyajit Style.
Right?

958
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:37,473
Don't go so deep.

959
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,397
Just candid.
-Ok.

960
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:41,467
Start shooting when she comes.
-Ok, sir.

961
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:43,503
Ready?

962
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:46,408

Yes. What's going on here?
-Nothing.

966
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:58,359
Is there a shooting? -Our company

967
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,387
So today they're covering routine
activities of the office.

968
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,456
Come.
-So many cameras.

969
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:06,360
Why are they shooting me?

970
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:13,333
No.
They're not shooting you, but me.

971
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,444
Just ignore them. Ok?

972
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:17,343
Come. I'll introduce you to CEO.

973
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:19,311

00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:23,441
Come. This way.

976
00:55:24,354 --> 00:55:25,446
Yeah. I'm leaving.

977
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,321
I'll be there in another
20 minutes.

978
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,350
Yeah. I'm on my way.
-He's very busy.

979
00:55:32,295 --> 00:55:33,284
Ok. See you.

00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:36,399
Yeah.
-Sir.

981
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,333
She's Sumana Rai Chaudhary.
I told you about her.

982
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:40,301
Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, Sumana.

983
00:55:40,403 --> 00:55:42,428
Sorry I can't tell you to sit.
-I know.

984
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,473
I've to rush for my press

985
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,441
It's ok, sir.
-That's all right, sir.

986
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:49,309
I just wanted to give
you my résumé. -Sure.

987
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:52,471
By the way,
you could've given it to Obrojit.

988
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,250
Very nice. Very nice.

989
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:00,252
I'll surely call you very soon.

990
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:03,459
Ok.
-Ok, bye. And...

00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:07,455
Sure, sir. Thank you, sir.

993
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:09,355
Ok. Welcome.

994
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:13,366
Fantastic. What a great shot!

995
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:15,304
Cut it.

996
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,307
You told me that he has a good
rapport with her CEO.

997
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,339
Then why are you tense?

998
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:23,370
I'm not tense.

999
00:56:25,281 --> 00:56:26,339
Then? Confused?

1000
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,443
I'm not confused.

1001
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:31,310
Sangeeta, I'm angry.

1002
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:33,353
With whom?
-I don't know.

1003
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,485
Then tell me the reason
of your anger.

1004
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,385
I've no reason.

1005
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,362
I don't know... I mean...

1006
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:44,389
I'm clueless.

1007
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:49,427
Tell me, how is your Aryan?
When is he coming to India?

1008
00:56:52,375 --> 00:56:55,310
Sumana,
the Aryan whom you never met...

1009
00:56:55,478 --> 00:56:57,378
with whom you've just
talked on phone...

1010
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,414
suddenly why are you
so interested in him?

1011
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:02,315
What's the matter?

1012
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:04,445
Matter? How could you think
of it? You're my friend.

1013
00:57:04,454 --> 00:57:06,422
He's my bot friend.
It's as simple as that. Ok?

1014
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:09,390
The matter is that
you're in love.

1015
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:11,486
No... with Aryan? Are you mad?

1016
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,319
No.

1017
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,267
With Subro or with Ooro.

1018
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:25,465
2 birds...

1019
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:28,468
with hopes...

1020
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:32,405
are flying somewhere.

1021
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,284
We'll make a home for ourselves.

1022
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:45,317
I came on your call...

1023
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:47,351
Yes.

1024
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,431
Ooro. Subro.

1025
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,435
Hello.
-Hi. Sumana here.

1026
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:56,396
Yes. I know because I
recognize your voice.

1027
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,308
Do you know I went to Ooro's
office yesterday?

1028
00:57:59,509 --> 00:58:02,376
But there were shooting
a corporate film.

1029
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:04,473
So I gave my résumé to his CEO.

1030
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,476
I know. Because I'm Ooro.

1031
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,310
Yes.

1032
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,311
Ooro, hi.

1033
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:15,355
Brother is in the bathroom.
Tell me.

1034
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:18,326
Then tell your brother
to phone me.

1035
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:19,417
Why?

1036
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,490
Doctor has told you
not to talk to me.

1037
00:58:22,398 --> 00:58:24,263
No, it's not like that.

1038
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:25,356
But...

1039
00:58:26,402 --> 00:58:29,394
Tell me, when will your CEO
call me for an interview?

1040
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:35,468
In a week or 2.
He went to Delhi for 3 days.

1041
00:58:36,379 --> 00:58:37,403
I see.

1042
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:40,249
But don't worry.
Your work will be done.

1043
00:58:41,317 --> 00:58:42,306
I'm here.

1044
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,411
Brother is here.

1045
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,252
Phone.

1046
00:58:48,491 --> 00:58:51,289
Sumana. Talk to her.

1047
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:54,485
Hi, Sumana. Yes.

1048
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,389
Hi.
-What's this?

1049
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:59,492
Long time no see. Where are you?

1050
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:04,237
What to do? I've busy schedule.
very hectic.

1051
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:07,238
How do you manage to work so much?

1052
00:59:07,343 --> 00:59:09,311
Don't you get anxious under
constant pressure?

1053
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:12,278
It has its own high. Come and
see the shooting yourself.

1054
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:14,347
Just hold on. Someone is here.
-Ok.

1055
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:15,373
Just hold.

1056
00:59:15,485 --> 00:59:16,474
Surprise.

1057
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:23,292
I thought of surprising
both of you.

1058
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,290
What a surprise!

1059
00:59:28,364 --> 00:59:29,353
Yes.

1060
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,359
Any problem. No...

1061
00:59:33,269 --> 00:59:34,429
No problem.
-Yes.

1062
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,429
May I come in?
-Yes.

1063
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:39,338
Ok. Sure?

1064
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,277
Yes. Come.

1065
00:59:41,344 --> 00:59:42,368
Yes...

1066
00:59:44,314 --> 00:59:45,508
Can I get some milk?

1067
00:59:46,282 --> 00:59:47,476
Cat spilled my milk.

1068
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:52,479
Cat?
-Yes.

1069
00:59:53,323 --> 00:59:54,312
Where is Ooro?

1070
00:59:55,325 --> 00:59:56,417
You came to investigate.
-Ooro.

1071
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:59,326
Ooro. -If you'd phoned,
grocer would've sent tons of milk.

1072
00:59:59,462 --> 01:00:01,396
I know you came to check me.

1073
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,288
Ooro.

1074
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,301
Ooro? What do you mean?

1075
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,270
Ooro. Look. He's here.

1076
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:11,396
He's here.
Right is Ooro and left is Subro.

1077
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,273
But where is Ooro?
-Where is he?

1078
01:00:14,377 --> 01:00:17,312
Where is Ooro? He left.
-But he was here.

1079
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:19,406
He left so quickly.
-When I...

1080
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,314
When I was talking on phone,
he left.

1081
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:24,443
Isn't it a nice photo?

1082
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:28,256
I'll phone him. He tells me
that I don't talk to him.

1083
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,383
I'll bring milk.

1084
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,453
I'll... yes. Phone him.

1085
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,327
No! If it rings...

1086
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:38,322
Phone him.

1087
01:00:40,503 --> 01:00:43,370
Yes. You may phone him!

1088
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,306
I can't connect.
I'm trying for long.

1089
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:48,332
Really?
-Yes.

1090
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,400
It's unavailable.

1091
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:52,413
Strange! -Thank you.
-It could be network problem.

1092
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:55,508
This is for you too.
-It's possible, but...

1093
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,353
Thanks.

1094
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,324
Don't thank me for such
a small thing.

1095
01:01:02,358 --> 01:01:03,416
No.
-You can take more.

1096
01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:07,361
No. For not offering me tea and
giving me whole liter packet.

1097
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,455
I'm sorry.

1098
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:13,299
In fear... I mean in excitement
I forgot to offer tea.

1099
01:01:13,403 --> 01:01:15,496
You came to ask for milk so...
-Don't worry.

1100
01:01:15,538 --> 01:01:18,507
It's ok. I know I took your
lot of time and... -Yes. No.

1101
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:21,367
You're getting late to go to office.
-It's ok.

1102
01:01:21,477 --> 01:01:24,275
Never mind.
Tomorrow my house. Dinner.

1103
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:27,349
Tomorrow is my birthday and I'll
not take any excuses. Ok.

1104
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:32,319
And both of you've to come.

1105
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:36,315

-Sure. -Yeah.

1106
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:38,292

-Ok. -Yes.

1107
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,293

1109
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:45,297
Ok. Yes.
-We'll come.

1110
01:01:45,401 --> 01:01:47,392
Not just 2 of us but
if I've another...

1111
01:01:47,437 --> 01:01:49,302
brother I'll bring him too.

1112
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,361
very funny.

1113
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,398
But we're just 2. We'll come.

1114
01:01:58,314 --> 01:01:59,303
Wasn't it nice?

1115
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,372
Now Juhi Chawla.

1116
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,246
Good idea.

1117
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:05,345
Ok. Juhi Chawla.
-Juhi Chawla.

1118
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:06,480
From film 'One Two Ka Four'.
-Yes.

1119
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:10,356
Who is this young lad?

1120
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,258
Is he your younger brother?

1121
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:15,431
Constable,
can I come to settle your house?

1122
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,494
I can make 150 dishes.

1123
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,270
And 200 devotional songs.

1124
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,359

1125
01:02:23,939 --> 01:02:25,498
Great!

1126
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:28,277
Mind blowing.
-Thank you.

1127
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:30,336
Now last. Last is Madhubala.

1128
01:02:30,446 --> 01:02:34,348
Yeah!
-Madhubala. -Greetings.

01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,309
Ok.

1131
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:40,311
Thank you.

1132
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:44,290
This maid expected this
from the generous king.

1133
01:02:46,962 --> 01:02:48,430
Thank you.

1134
01:02:48,464 --> 01:02:50,329
Great!

1135
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:51,423
Just praising won't do.

1136
01:02:51,467 --> 01:02:54,300
Give me something to drink too.
-Yes, one minute.

1137
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:55,462
I'll get something.
-Beer too.

1138
01:02:56,472 --> 01:03:00,272
Excuse me.
-I mean no beer.

1139
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,377
very smart.

1140
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,282
Hey!
-Happy birthday, Sumana.

1141
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,339
Thank you.

1142
01:03:10,453 --> 01:03:12,478
Tell me, are you Subro or Ooro?

1143
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:18,383
Who can come on time on
Sumana's birthday?

1144
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:21,386
Ooro.
-Come on.

1145
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:23,423
You still can't differentiate.

1146
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,356
I'm Subro.

1147
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:27,324
Sorry.

1148
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,496
Anyway,
you've not Yet cut the cake.

1149
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,465
How could I? You've just arrived.

1150
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,468
Friend, let's cut the cake.
Hurry up. I've left shooting.

1151
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,312
I've to return.
I'm wearing shooting costume.

1152
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,348
Ok, wait. Let Ooro come.

1153
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:49,449
So say that you were
waiting for Ooro.

1154
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,384
I was happy for no reason.

1155
01:03:54,363 --> 01:03:55,387
It's not like, Subro.

1156
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,368
You sit. I'll get cold drinks.

1157
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:09,435
Karuna Sindhu.
-Yes.

1158
01:04:10,379 --> 01:04:13,507
I think Ooro is needed
here more than me.

1159
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,377
I'll leave.

1160
01:04:18,454 --> 01:04:21,287
Subro. Wait a minute.

1161
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:22,416
Uncle, what happened?
-Subro left.

1162
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:26,256
I'll stop him. Stay here.

1163
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:27,387
Subro.
-Uncle, listen.

1164
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:29,489
Uncle.

1165
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,461
Subro must've taken the lift.
Let's take the stairs.

1166
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:48,383
Where are you?
-Go slowly.

1167
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,475
Where...
-Uncle...

1168
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:51,408
Uncle, wait.

1169
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,388
Subro. Watchman. Stop him.

1170
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,390
Subro. Subro.

1171
01:04:56,459 --> 01:04:58,484
Subro. Subro, stop.

1172
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:01,422
Hey, driver. Stop the car.
-Sir, left.

1173
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:04,261
How could he leave?

1174
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,289
I don't know.

1175
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:07,291
He's here.

1176
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:10,239
Hi.

1177
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:11,406
Hello.

1178
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:13,433
What are you doing here?

1179
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:16,402
That... Subro left in anger.

1180
01:05:17,446 --> 01:05:19,277
Subro left.

1181
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:21,407
Yes. -Subro left.
-That's better.

1182
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:24,283
I mean after all why did he leave.

1183
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,284
What happened?

1184
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:31,255
I don't know. Let's go upstairs.

1185
01:05:31,294 --> 01:05:34,422
I mean... -We should not waste
this beautiful evening.

1186
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,488
Of course.
-Yes, please.

1187
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,494
Please come.

1188
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:40,291
Ooro.

1189
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:43,464
Subro, there is a message
on your mobile.

1190
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:47,340
Subro is avoiding me too these days.
-I don't know why.

1191
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:49,344
Forget me. Now Ooro is there.

1192
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,369
You can cut the cake.

1193
01:05:50,413 --> 01:05:51,437
Everything all right.

1194
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,304
Yeah.

1195
01:05:53,416 --> 01:05:54,405
Let's cut the cake.

1196
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:56,441
Yes of course. Sure.

1197
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,282
Sohini. Where is Sohini?

1198
01:05:58,354 --> 01:05:59,343
Yes, sir.
-Sohini!

1199
01:06:01,324 --> 01:06:03,485
Next 3 episodes. -Shooting should
go on day and night. -Ok.

1200
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,352
Come on. Hurry up. Come on.

1201
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,304
Yes, Sumana?

1202
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,371
Hi, Subro.

1203
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:18,273
How are you?

1204
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:21,274
I know you're very busy
and angry with me too.

1205
01:06:21,444 --> 01:06:23,275
But I've a request.

1206
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:26,338
Can you meet me for at
Calcutta Club for an...

1207
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,350
exclusive Bengali dinner
this evening?

1208
01:06:28,451 --> 01:06:31,318
Bengali cuisine.

1209
01:06:31,354 --> 01:06:34,323
And otherwise your favorite dish.

1210
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:36,448
Whatever you say,
but just you and me.

1211
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:38,419
And Ooro?

1212
01:06:39,328 --> 01:06:40,420
Subro, come on.

Calcutta Club. 7.30.

1215
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:48,394
Are you falling in love?

1216
01:06:49,338 --> 01:06:53,399
Just give it a thought.

1217
01:06:54,343 --> 01:07:00,304
Before you say I love you.

1218
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:07,414
I love you.

1219
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,316
Are you falling in love?

1220
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:15,456
Just give it a thought before
you say I love you.

1221
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,459
I love you.

1222
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,448
Are you falling in love?

1223
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:38,442
Just give it a thought before
you say I love you.

1224
01:07:39,288 --> 01:07:42,348
I love you.

1225
01:07:43,325 --> 01:07:45,259
Are you falling in love?

1226
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:50,254
Just give it a thought before
you say I love you.

1227
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,459
I love you.

1228
01:07:55,304 --> 01:08:02,369
Think hard before exchanging
hearts.

1229
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:10,282
Think hard before exchanging
hearts.

1230
01:08:10,386 --> 01:08:17,383
Love is sweet but risky.

1231
01:08:18,294 --> 01:08:24,426
Think hard before exchanging
hearts.

1232
01:08:25,401 --> 01:08:34,309
Love is sweet but risky.
-Are you falling in love?

1233
01:08:34,343 --> 01:08:39,303
Just give it a thought before
you say I love you.

1234
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:43,408
I love you.

1235
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:10,438
Tread carefully on the
path of love.

1236
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:21,413
Tread carefully on the
path of love.

1237
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:29,355
Don't lose yourself in
this intoxication.

1238
01:09:29,465 --> 01:09:36,428
Love is sweet but risky.

1239
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:44,370
Think hard before exchanging
hearts.

1240
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:51,386
Think hard before exchanging
hearts.

1241
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:59,387
Love is sweet but risky.

1242
01:09:59,461 --> 01:10:01,258
Are you falling in love?

1243
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:06,257
Just give it a thought
before you say LOVE.

1244
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:09,430
I love you.

1245
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,271
Are you falling in love?

1246
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:17,336
Just give it a thought
before you say LOVE.

1247
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:22,281
I love you.

1248
01:10:23,485 --> 01:10:25,248
I love you, Subro.

1249
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:30,347
Wait.

1250
01:10:30,426 --> 01:10:31,415
What?

1251
01:10:33,462 --> 01:10:34,451
I love you too.

1252
01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:35,485
But...

1253
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:37,456
I'm not Subro, but Ooro.

1254
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:38,488
What?

1255
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:44,439
You brothers are incorrigible!

1256
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:47,375
What did I do?

1257
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:48,501
Brother was stuck in shooting.

1258
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,279
So what happened is that your
phone wasn't reachable.

1259
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,372
So he told me to come
and tell you...

1260
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:55,441
Why didn't you tell me before
that you're Ooro?

1261
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:57,451
If you put sweets in my mouth,
how can I talk?

1262
01:10:57,519 --> 01:11:00,420
Anyway I thought it was a good opportunity.
-I could propose you.

1263
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:02,389
We're twins. Same...
-Shut up!

1264
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:05,393
I'm better than him. What do you think?
-Just shut up! Ok?

1265
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,485
Stupid brothers!

1266
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,332
Ok. I'll write my episode.

1267
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:13,325
Stop here. Take this.

1268
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:14,424
Keep the change.

1269
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:16,395
It's ok. Keep the change.

1270
01:11:18,507 --> 01:11:20,304
Idiotic!

1271
01:11:20,342 --> 01:11:22,242
Both are brothers are so sly.

1272
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:23,402
It won't work, madam.

1273
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:25,369
Shut up!

1274
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,272
What do you know?

1275
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,339
Madam, I know.

1276
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,419
This lift isn't working.
It's broken.

1277
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,385
You've to take the lift.

1278
01:11:36,392 --> 01:11:37,381
I don't know...

1279
01:11:44,366 --> 01:11:45,458
why I got stuck between them?

1280
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,428
Hi, Sumana.
-Hi.

1281
01:11:48,304 --> 01:11:49,293
Right on time.

1282
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:52,337
Yes, I'm leaving.

1283
01:11:53,342 --> 01:11:54,468
I'll be there in another
20 minutes.

1284
01:11:55,477 --> 01:11:57,342
Yes. I'm on my way. Come on.

1285
01:11:58,347 --> 01:11:59,336
Ok, see.

1286
01:12:01,450 --> 01:12:02,474
Yes.

1287
01:12:02,518 --> 01:12:04,452
She's Sumana Rai Chaudhary.
I'd told you.

1288
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:09,289
I can't ask you to sit.
-I know.

1289
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:11,358
Sumana!

1290
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:13,427
You too got addicted to acting.

1291
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,429
You're acting in serial.

1292
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:18,357
Miss Mirchandani, acting...

1293
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:20,459
This is Subro's serial.

1294
01:12:21,303 --> 01:12:22,327
He has made a great drama.

1295
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:27,364
Do you know hero Rohit meets his
heroine as his twin brother?

1296
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:29,341
And heroine doesn't even know.

1297
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,241
Ok?

1298
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,440
But now heroine has found out.

1299
01:12:36,318 --> 01:12:39,378
And she'll whack the hero.

1300
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,417
I know you're upset.

1301
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,494
I'm sorry. I couldn't come
last night for dinner.

1302
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:49,363
The shooting got over late.
What do I do?

1303
01:12:49,398 --> 01:12:50,387
Sorry.

1304
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,501
You're talking to me?

1305
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:58,465
Come on, Sumana.
Stop joking. I'm serious.

1306
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,501
I... I just couldn't come.

1307
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,377
Sumana? I see.

1308
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:08,449
It seems you're making the
mistake others make too.

1309
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:10,442
I'm not Sumana.

1310
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,287
I'm her twin sister Pornima.

1311
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:15,381
I came from Delhi last night.

1312
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:17,381
Nice to meet you.

1313
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:22,263
So... where is Sumana?

1314
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:26,456
With Ooro.

1315
01:13:28,337 --> 01:13:29,429
Ok?
-Yes.

1316
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:32,374
You mean that...

1317
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:38,402
I hate you.

1318
01:13:39,314 --> 01:13:41,305
I'm sorry.
-I hate you.

1319
01:13:41,383 --> 01:13:43,408
I'm sorry.
-You lied to me... -Listen.

1320
01:13:43,452 --> 01:13:46,353
I'm sorry.
-What's the use of apologizing now?

1321
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:50,325
I hate you. Why did you lie?

1322
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:53,327
I swear I'm sorry.
-You bothered me. -Madam...

1323
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:55,296
I wasn't there.

1324
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:57,422
What do you think of yourself?
You were lying to me.

1325
01:13:57,499 --> 01:14:00,263
You were fooling me. I hate you.

1326
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:05,432
Sumana.
-So?

1327
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:07,399
I hate you too.

1328
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:10,469
Tell me...
-No.

1329
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:12,469
Hey.
-No.

1330
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:14,504
Hey.

1331
01:14:17,319 --> 01:14:18,445
Yes. Yes.

1332
01:14:20,355 --> 01:14:21,379
Subro, what's this?

1333
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,391
You always say you smoke when
you feel loneliness.

1334
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:27,428
Now I'm here so why do you smoke.
-Dear, my loneliness...

1335
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:30,398
is gone as you've come
but my tension has increased.

1336
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,297
I'm increasing your tension.

1337
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,403
No. Not you. I'm sorry.

1338
01:14:36,305 --> 01:14:37,272
It's not so.

1339
01:14:37,372 --> 01:14:39,363
My story stopped on 26th episode.

1340
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:41,342
It ended.

1341
01:14:41,443 --> 01:14:43,434
It ended before interval,
what should I do?

1342
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:45,469
Hey, excuse me.

1343
01:14:46,381 --> 01:14:47,473
The girl has agreed to marry...

1344
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,451
but you're thinking
of your serial.

1345
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:54,422
You don't understand.
-I do.

1346
01:14:55,390 --> 01:14:56,448
I don't know what to do.

1347
01:14:57,459 --> 01:15:00,292
Good.
-God, help me.

1348
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:02,285
You won't understand.

1349
01:15:02,397 --> 01:15:05,264
Fool, this girl is right.

1350
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:08,426
Forget the serial and prepare
to get married.

1351
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:10,338
I'm here.

1352
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:12,307
And you?

1353
01:15:12,441 --> 01:15:16,275
You too go and enjoy popcorn
and ice cream.

1354
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:17,471
We'll be back after the break.

1355
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:21,512
I am a fairy. Don't touch me.

1356
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,480
Subro. Subro.

1357
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,490
Good morning.
-Good morning.

1358
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:37,295
What's this girl doing with you?
Is everything fine?

1359
01:15:37,399 --> 01:15:42,234
Miss Mirchandani!
I was with Subro since last night.

1360
01:15:43,372 --> 01:15:47,274
It means whole night both of you...
my God!

1361
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:50,342
You're more bold than Kamini
of Kasoor Kiska.

1362
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,243
Sumana, this isn't right.
Don't tease her.

1363
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,476
Give all the details
to Miss Mirchandani.

1364
01:15:57,319 --> 01:15:59,514
What will you tell me now?
Entire episode ended.

1365
01:15:59,521 --> 01:16:01,352
Now will you tell
me title sequence.

1366
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:05,520
Now tell all that to
Karuna agatpati.

1367
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:07,421
When he finds out that you two...

1368
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:08,485
No!

1369
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,395
He's congratulate us
on our marriage.

1370
01:16:11,366 --> 01:16:13,334
Marriage?
-Yes.

1371
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:16,337
Whose marriage?
-We got married.

1372
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:21,240
Cong... congratulations.

1373
01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:22,277
Wait.

1374
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:23,368
Thank you.

1375
01:16:23,545 --> 01:16:27,242
When? Why did you marry?

1376
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:32,375
What's this?

1377
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,222
What's this? Why did she...

1378
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:39,387
Hey. Sumana,
you're doubting me because of her.

1379
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,489
I'd to get suspicious you, Shu.

1380
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:45,460
Till today everything was fine,
but it stopped suddenly.

1381
01:16:46,301 --> 01:16:50,237
And you're saying that you can't
think of further tracks.

1382
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,206
What's this?

1383
01:16:54,409 --> 01:16:56,468
Shu, tell me the truth.

1384
01:16:57,312 --> 01:17:01,339
Were you writing these episodes
or someone else?

1385
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,343
Yes, madam. No... I was writing u

1386
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,479
I swear.
You've seen my credentials.

1387
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,257
It happens sometimes, madam.

1388
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,486
It's just a writer's block.

1389
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:14,256
I need some time.
I'll get over it.

1390
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:17,331
To hell with this Anekta Kapoor!
-She wants twist in the story.

1391
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,458
From where can I bring the twist?

1392
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,263
She shouldn't taken hero of 60's.

1393
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,236
She would've got twist.
Should I break my head?

1394
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:23,360
God!

1395
01:17:23,405 --> 01:17:24,372
Hello.

1396
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:31,343
I told you many times not to call
God for such small things.

1397
01:17:31,546 --> 01:17:34,515
He's busy with terrorism.

1398
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,411
This is my department.
Phone me directly.

1399
01:17:37,486 --> 01:17:39,511
Tell me. What do you want?

1400
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:43,520
Look, please come after informing
or I'll get heart attack.

1401
01:17:46,294 --> 01:17:49,229
I got stuck with the story of my serial.
-I don't know what to do.

1402
01:17:49,264 --> 01:17:51,391
Yes,
but your life is going on well.

1403
01:17:51,533 --> 01:17:54,366
You got such a beautiful
wife that you liked.

1404
01:17:54,403 --> 01:17:56,530
If the serial won't work,
my house will get stuck too.

1405
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:58,228
What will I do then?

1406
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,271
You gave me the idea to start.

1407
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:03,368
Now tell me how to move it further.
-Tell me. Please.

1408
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:04,367
Ok.

1409
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,316
Yes. Go to Goa.

1410
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:12,220
What's this idea?
Why should I go to Goa?

1411
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:15,518
Fool, whenever a writer
gets lost for ideas...

1412
01:18:15,524 --> 01:18:19,255
and he wanders in the darkness,
then he goes to Goa.

1413
01:18:19,361 --> 01:18:24,264
It seems that ideas hang from
trees instead of coconuts there.

1414
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:26,267
Go to Goa.

1415
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,269
Idea!

1416
01:18:30,305 --> 01:18:31,272
Coming.

1417
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,440
Hi.
-Hi.

1418
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,375
What happened?

1419
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:46,309
What happened?

1420
01:18:47,322 --> 01:18:48,311
Is everything fine?

1421
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:50,448
Tell me.

1422
01:18:51,526 --> 01:18:54,256
Why are you so upset? Why?

1423
01:18:54,529 --> 01:18:57,225
Want water? I'll get it.

1424
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,526
Tell me. Just a minute.

1425
01:19:02,504 --> 01:19:05,337
What happened? Got any idea.

1426
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,276
Sumana, I can't think of anything.

1427
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,505
Shall we go to Goa?
-Why?

1428
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:17,246
Friend, we'll go on honeymoon
and I might get an idea.

1429
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,516
Subro...
-I know you won't get leave.

1430
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:22,314
I know it.

1431
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:26,260
No, Subro. I want to say something
to you. Listen.

1432
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:32,265
Do you know today my general
manager called me? -Why?

1433
01:19:32,300 --> 01:19:37,237
No. He wants to send me
to London for a month.

1434
01:19:37,339 --> 01:19:40,308
For a training course British
Pharmaceutical...

1435
01:19:40,375 --> 01:19:44,311
And you want to go.
-No. No. No.

1436
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:46,369
No.

1437
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:47,472
Subro, are you mad?

1438
01:19:48,383 --> 01:19:51,352
You won't get such chance again.
You must go.

1439
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:53,309
Yes.
-Yes.

1440
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,519
Hello.
-Hello, madam.

1441
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:04,357
Yes, I've a small request.

1442
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:05,388
Tell me, Shu.

1443
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,469
Madam, to write further episodes
I want to go to Goa. May I?

1444
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,534
Shu, you can even go to Timbaktu.

1445
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:15,242
But think of such a twist
in our story that...

1446
01:20:15,277 --> 01:20:17,472
all the other episodes
should be surpassed.

1447
01:20:45,307 --> 01:20:48,242
Hi.
Subrojit Chakravarty. Single room.

1448
01:21:04,326 --> 01:21:05,452
viva Goa.

1449
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:10,492
Come. Idea! Drop on me.

1450
01:21:27,515 --> 01:21:29,278
You should say that it's hot.

1451
01:21:33,355 --> 01:21:35,380
Coffee is hot,
so blow before you drink.

1452
01:21:37,259 --> 01:21:40,319
Enjoy life in a leisure pace.

1453
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,385
Nice.

1454
01:21:44,332 --> 01:21:48,200
Yes.
You're right. I didn't realize...

1455
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:49,259
coffee is hot.

1456
01:21:49,304 --> 01:21:51,238
I mean coffee is quite hot.

1457
01:21:51,373 --> 01:21:52,340
It got burnt.

1458
01:21:54,276 --> 01:21:55,470
Sorry, by the way I'm Subro.

1459
01:21:57,545 --> 01:22:00,378
A writer by profession
and poet by choice.

1460
01:22:01,483 --> 01:22:03,212
I'm a vagabond at heart.

1461
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,345
Think I'm like a drifting cloud.

1462
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:10,390
Very nice.
Coincidentally I'm a writer too.

1463
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,361
But I liked you poetic style.

1464
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:15,325
Yes.
-Thank you.

1465
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:19,227
By the way,
you look confused and perplexed.

1466
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,258
You seen to be stuck in a problem.

1467
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:23,464
You're a writer.
You may understand.

1468
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,300
Writer's block. I write TV
serials. I got stuck in plot.

1469
01:22:30,478 --> 01:22:32,469
I think you should go outdoor.

1470
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,374
There is a Goa Church nearby.
Go there.

1471
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:49,260
Drop on me, Ideas!

1472
01:23:06,281 --> 01:23:09,216
Hello. Hello. Sumana!

1473
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:12,444
Sumana, what are you doing here?
What happened?

1474
01:23:15,323 --> 01:23:18,315
Sumana, come on.
What happened? Tell me.

1475
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,328
visa problem?
Flight got cancelled...

1476
01:23:20,362 --> 01:23:22,296
or punctured? What happened?

1477
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,491
Why are you so angry?
Tell me what happened?

1478
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:28,298
Excuse me.
Keep your hands to yourself.

1479
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:32,370
And I'm not your Sumana.

1480
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,246
Then you're not Sumana?

1481
01:23:42,517 --> 01:23:43,506
Yes.

1482
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:47,379
My name is Mohak (beautiful).

1483
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:49,482
You're beautiful.

1484
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,486
But what's your name?
-Excuse me.

1485
01:23:52,527 --> 01:23:57,294
My name is Mohak, not description.

1486
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:04,361
You know what happened is
that you're like my wife.

1487
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:09,241
I mean you look so much
like my wife...

1488
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:14,305
not completely,
but so much that I got deceived.

1489
01:24:14,349 --> 01:24:16,249
I thought you're my wife.

1490
01:24:17,252 --> 01:24:20,312
Actually strange! I didn't know
it happens I real life.

1491
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:22,518
Laugh as much as you want!

1492
01:24:23,258 --> 01:24:26,250
First I made you my idea now
you're doing the same.

1493
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:30,454
So are you alone or with someone?

1494
01:24:31,332 --> 01:24:32,458
I'm alone right now.

1495
01:24:33,268 --> 01:24:35,293
And as usual my husband
is on tour.

1496
01:24:37,505 --> 01:24:40,474
So where are you staying in Goa?

1497
01:24:41,376 --> 01:24:42,343
Hotel Neelam.

1498
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,514
It's a day of coincidence.

1499
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:48,510
I never saw so much coincidence.

1500
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:51,280
I'm staying there too
by coincidence.

1501
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,479
How strange! Right.

1502
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:56,382
I know. -So if you don't mind
I'm returning to hotel...

1503
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:59,517
I can give you lift in my car.

1504
01:25:00,528 --> 01:25:01,517
Yeah. Sure.

1505
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,335
Just give me a minute.
I need to smoke.

1506
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:14,468
Sorry. Do you smoke?

1507
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:16,243
No.

1508
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:17,278
Sure.

1509
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:18,312
I quit.

1510
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:23,376
You know my darling wife Sumana
hates it. So I quit.

1511
01:25:30,492 --> 01:25:34,292
You... you smoke regularly.

1512
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:36,491
No, only sometimes.

1513
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:41,291
My husband hates cigarette.
So I don't smoke in front of him.

1514
01:25:41,336 --> 01:25:45,363
How sweet! You're very bold.

1515
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:47,468
What's there to be bold?

1516
01:25:48,276 --> 01:25:51,507
I mean every woman should
get her freedom.

1517
01:25:52,380 --> 01:25:53,506
Absolutely. I agree.

1518
01:25:54,282 --> 01:26:00,243
So keeping this thought in mind,
if you dine with me...

1519
01:26:00,288 --> 01:26:04,452
then you shouldn't mind.
Your husband won't mind. Right?

1520
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:08,262
What's relation between
dinner and husband?

1521
01:26:08,296 --> 01:26:10,264
Nothing.
-I can always come for dinner.

1522
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:12,528
Fantastic.
So for that we should leave.

1523
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:14,290
Come.
-Ok.

1524
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:16,402
Come on. Come.

1525
01:26:19,374 --> 01:26:21,308
Wait a minute. Coming.

1526
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:23,267
God knows who is there.

1527
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,276
Hi!
-Hi!

1528
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:29,510
How come you're here?

1529
01:26:30,485 --> 01:26:32,476
How did you find my room number?

1530
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:37,324
From reception, of course.

1531
01:26:39,394 --> 01:26:41,225
I read it in your eyes.

1532
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:44,294
You look like a flirt.

1533
01:26:44,399 --> 01:26:47,266
Why don't you sit for sometimes?
Be my guest.

1534
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:53,238
Ok, I won't flirt with
you but talk directly.

1535
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:58,507
This...
you... you get ready for dinner.

1536
01:26:59,414 --> 01:27:00,472
Yeah. Give me a minute.

1537
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:03,372
I'll be back quickly.

1538
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:05,411
Of course.

1539
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:08,355
Don't take too long.

1540
01:27:15,330 --> 01:27:17,264
Subro, can you please answer
the call for me?

1541
01:27:17,498 --> 01:27:19,489
Yes. Of course. Anything for you.

1542
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:25,429
Hello.

1543
01:27:25,506 --> 01:27:27,303
Sir, I'm calling from reception.

1544
01:27:27,342 --> 01:27:28,309
Yes.

1545
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:31,503
Sir, I'd to request madam
to make advance payment.

1546
01:27:32,347 --> 01:27:33,507
Advance payment. I'll tell her.

1547
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:01,467
Let's go far...

1548
01:28:01,509 --> 01:28:02,476
Who had phoned?

1549
01:28:04,312 --> 01:28:05,370
From reception.

1550
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,244
They were asking for advance.

1551
01:28:09,384 --> 01:28:11,375
Advance. I completely forgot.

1552
01:28:11,419 --> 01:28:14,479
No! God!

1553
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:19,326
Mohak. Shall we go for dinner?
We're getting late.

1554
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:21,523
Yeah! Just give me a minute.

1555
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:24,453
What happened?

1556
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,493
Something happened?
-I can't find money...

1557
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:29,429
Why not? You can't find money.

1558
01:28:30,271 --> 01:28:32,239
How could it?
-I'd one Lakh.

1559
01:28:32,307 --> 01:28:36,403
One Lakh. You lost it. How?
-I don't know.

1560
01:28:37,278 --> 01:28:39,473
I'd it before I went to bath.
It disappeared.

1561
01:28:39,547 --> 01:28:41,481
One minute.
Are you trying to say...

1562
01:28:42,283 --> 01:28:45,411
I was in the room when you went
to bathe. Did I stole money?

1563
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:48,216
Do you want to frisk me?
You want to call the police. -No.

1564
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:49,280
Relax please. It's ok.

1565
01:28:50,391 --> 01:28:53,519
Maybe I dropped it and someone took it.
-It's possible.

1566
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:58,356
But... -Mohak, don't worry.
Tell me if I can help you.

1567
01:28:58,399 --> 01:28:59,423
What can you...

1568
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,263
Tell me...
-Can you help me?

1569
01:29:02,503 --> 01:29:05,495
Can you give me one Lakh rupees?
-One Lakh.

1570
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,298
No, I know it's too much.

1571
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:10,344
Coincidence. One more coincidence!

1572
01:29:10,478 --> 01:29:15,313
I've one Lakh rupees right
now in my room.

1573
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:17,477
Thank you.
-Come to my room...

1574
01:29:18,252 --> 01:29:20,447
I'll give you one Lakh rupee.

1575
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:22,278
Ok.

1576
01:29:24,258 --> 01:29:25,316
You're looking very nice.

1577
01:29:26,260 --> 01:29:29,491
Thank you.
-By the way, your one Lakh rupee.

1578
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:30,519
Thank you so much.

1579
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:37,362
Just thank you won't do,
Miss Mohak.

1580
01:29:38,339 --> 01:29:39,306
What do you mean?

1581
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:42,502
This...
before taking one Lakh rupee...

1582
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:45,267
at least you must...

1583
01:29:45,346 --> 01:29:52,252
tell me what can you do for
me in return of these money?

1584
01:29:52,286 --> 01:29:55,255
What exactly do you mean?

1585
01:29:55,523 --> 01:30:01,462
I mean, as long as I'm here in
Goa, in this hot weather...

1586
01:30:02,330 --> 01:30:05,322
you'll stay with me
as my companion.

1587
01:30:06,334 --> 01:30:07,460
Do you know what you're saying?

1588
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:12,234
Exactly. I'm saying exactly
what you're thinking.

1589
01:30:13,374 --> 01:30:16,275
How sick!
I thought you were a gentleman.

1590
01:30:16,310 --> 01:30:20,337
I'll be gentle.
-Aren't you ashamed to even ask me?

1591
01:30:22,517 --> 01:30:24,314
You cheap!

1592
01:30:25,353 --> 01:30:28,379
Just a minute. Enough!

1593
01:30:28,489 --> 01:30:30,389
I was just kidding, Sumana.

1594
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,449
Hey, Mr. Subrojit Chakravarty.

1595
01:30:32,527 --> 01:30:35,291
I told you not to call me Sumana.

1596
01:30:35,530 --> 01:30:38,328
Ok, I'm sorry, Sumana...

1597
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:41,460
I won't say that.
I'll say, I'm sorry, Mohak.

1598
01:30:42,236 --> 01:30:43,362
Ok, let's go for dinner.

1599
01:30:43,404 --> 01:30:45,235
To hell with your dinner.

1600
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,365
Ok. Stop.

1601
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:51,307
I stole your money. Take it back.

1602
01:30:51,345 --> 01:30:53,313
I wanted to make you accept
you're my wife.

1603
01:30:53,381 --> 01:30:54,370
So I stole. Take it.

1604
01:30:55,249 --> 01:30:57,342
What do you mean?
You stole my money.

1605
01:30:58,519 --> 01:31:01,488
Thank God I didn't lodge a
complain in the police.

1606
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:03,484
Do you know if I'd
been your wife...

1607
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:05,350
I wouldn't have forgiven you?

1608
01:31:06,327 --> 01:31:09,490
I thought you were decent,
but you're a thief.

1609
01:31:09,530 --> 01:31:14,297
What? I'm not a thief.
I'm returning your money.

1610
01:31:20,274 --> 01:31:22,333
Friend, get lost.
I don't want dinner now.

1611
01:31:25,346 --> 01:31:29,373
When the entire world sleeps,
this happens here.

1612
01:31:30,284 --> 01:31:31,376
No. You're getting it wrong.

1613
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:33,454
Nothing like that is
happening here.

1614
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,456
Actually we're husband and wife.

1615
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:37,458
She's my husband, no wife...
-He...

1616
01:31:37,492 --> 01:31:40,290
We'd a dispute. We were going
to start pillow fight.

1617
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,319
He's lying. He's not my husband.

1618
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:45,489
He invited me for dinner
and then acted cheaply.

1619
01:31:47,268 --> 01:31:48,326
Do you know he's even a thief?

1620
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:52,234
He stole my money and
wants to help me now.

1621
01:31:52,306 --> 01:31:53,330
This...
-Idiot!

1622
01:31:54,242 --> 01:31:55,470
Anyway, my money.

1623
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:57,344
Thank you.

1624
01:31:59,347 --> 01:32:00,336
Idiot.

1625
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:04,307
Tread carefully in this world.

1626
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,480
There is illusion and deception
at every step.

1627
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:12,315
My foot!

1628
01:32:14,262 --> 01:32:15,490
Has Sumana gone mad?

1629
01:32:17,531 --> 01:32:19,222
God!

1630
01:32:19,667 --> 01:32:21,335
God!

1631
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:23,265
What's the matter, Subro?

1632
01:32:24,305 --> 01:32:26,466
God! No! Why did you come?

1633
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:29,436
I said God as I got hurt.
Not for TRP.

1634
01:32:30,411 --> 01:32:33,505
It's not a TRP problem.
I've only one problem now.

1635
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:36,278
My personal life is...

1636
01:32:37,351 --> 01:32:40,320
Your personal life isn't
diff from your show.

1637
01:32:40,521 --> 01:32:42,489
I know. You did it all.

1638
01:32:43,357 --> 01:32:44,517
But this time it's all messed up.

1639
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:50,230
My personal is totally disrupted
like an earthquake.

1640
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:55,429
This isn't earthquake but
your episode number 28.

1641
01:32:57,271 --> 01:32:58,238
Right.

1642
01:32:58,472 --> 01:33:00,303
Keep shooting continuously.

1643
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:03,468
The way our show's TRP
is increasing...

1644
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:08,281
we'll surely get this slot.
-Of course, madam.

1645
01:33:08,316 --> 01:33:12,252
But the only problem is we're
still little behind schedule.

1646
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:18,485
Hi! Good evening, madam.

1647
01:33:19,327 --> 01:33:22,296
Fantastic episodes.

1648
01:33:22,396 --> 01:33:24,330
You're a genius, Shu.

1649
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:25,454
Thank you.

1650
01:33:25,499 --> 01:33:28,229
How did you get this new thought?

1651
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:31,270
Is there a new writer?

1652
01:33:33,341 --> 01:33:37,243
You're right.
A big writer is writing it.

1653
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:40,473
Whatever and whoever.
I don't care.

1654
01:33:43,551 --> 01:33:47,248
But Shu,
this episodes are getting late.

1655
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:49,356
And shooting is behind schedule.

1656
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:51,324
So just hurry up a little.

1657
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:53,484
Yes, of course.
I'm trying my best.

1658
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:57,321
I like it, you know.

1659
01:33:57,498 --> 01:33:59,193
It was nice.

1660
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:01,494
Mr. Subro, come.

1661
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:05,234
Sir, don't be so angry with us.

1662
01:34:05,373 --> 01:34:07,273
You ignored us.

1663
01:34:07,408 --> 01:34:10,309
No. It's nothing like that.

1664
01:34:11,379 --> 01:34:13,347
Hello. Miss Mohak.

1665
01:34:14,515 --> 01:34:15,504
Hi, Subrojit.

1666
01:34:16,283 --> 01:34:18,308
I think you're still
angry with me.

1667
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:20,277
I'm really sorry. That...

1668
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:22,456
No. For what?

1669
01:34:22,523 --> 01:34:24,218
I'm absolutely fine.

1670
01:34:24,291 --> 01:34:25,349
I got my money.

1671
01:34:25,526 --> 01:34:27,460
Right.
-Let bygones be bygones.

1672
01:34:28,362 --> 01:34:30,353
Be seated.
Sandwiches are very tasty.

1673
01:34:30,531 --> 01:34:32,328
Taste them.

1674
01:34:36,270 --> 01:34:38,465
You always talk in rhymes.

1675
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,468
I'm a poet. I like to write poems.

1676
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:46,313
By the way,
there isn't ban on creativity.

1677
01:34:46,514 --> 01:34:48,505
Then you're here on holiday.

1678
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:50,374
A film is made on my novel.

1679
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,452
Shooting is going on here.
I'm here for that.

1680
01:34:54,388 --> 01:34:58,290
You... you surely must hate
TV and films. Right?

1681
01:34:58,392 --> 01:35:00,451
No. I love shooting.

1682
01:35:00,494 --> 01:35:02,291
And I like television.

1683
01:35:02,496 --> 01:35:04,464
Then come with me.
I'm going there.

1684
01:35:05,266 --> 01:35:07,257
Why not? Let's go. I'm ready.

1685
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:08,392
Come. Let's go.
-Yes.

1686
01:35:08,502 --> 01:35:09,491
Bye.
-Bye.

1687
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:11,295
Bye, Subrojit.

1688
01:35:11,505 --> 01:35:12,472
Bye, Miss Mohak.

1689
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:19,346
Bye.

1690
01:35:19,513 --> 01:35:22,277
You always talk in rhymes.
-Yes.

1691
01:35:22,416 --> 01:35:25,510
Life is a burden and punishment
without poems.

1692
01:35:26,520 --> 01:35:29,250
You too try it. It's fun.

1693
01:35:30,357 --> 01:35:31,517
No, no.

1694
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:36,488
Hey, please try. What's the harm?

1695
01:35:37,331 --> 01:35:41,199
Ok. Everyone can try.

1696
01:35:42,236 --> 01:35:43,328
I too rhymed.

1697
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:50,377
004487.

1698
01:35:52,313 --> 01:35:53,302
Hello.

1699
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:55,314
Subro. Sumana here.

1700
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:59,318
Hi. Hi, Sumana.

1701
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:00,409
Hi. How are you?

1702
01:36:00,488 --> 01:36:02,251
I'm fine. How are you?

1703
01:36:02,423 --> 01:36:03,412
I'm also fine.

1704
01:36:03,491 --> 01:36:07,484
And... why didn't you activated
your roaming phone?

1705
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:09,325
I was trying phone for long.

1706
01:36:10,297 --> 01:36:12,356
Sorry, honey. I didn't get
time to activate roaming.

1707
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:15,498
Anyway,
you can call me on local SIM.

1708
01:36:16,437 --> 01:36:18,337
Yes. Sure.

1709
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:21,239
And listen. How is London?

1710
01:36:21,308 --> 01:36:24,368
London is beautiful.
But I don't like it without you.

1711
01:36:24,478 --> 01:36:27,242
Isn't it?
You should've taken me along.

1712
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:30,340
What would've happened of the
girl you're romancing now?

1713
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:33,318
Who is she? Who is here?

1714
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:35,345
Who...
-Dear, I'm talking about your script.

1715
01:36:36,257 --> 01:36:39,226
I know you still have
it on your lap.

1716
01:36:39,493 --> 01:36:41,324
Yes, you're right.

1717
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:44,387
How is work going on?
Did you write something?

1718
01:36:45,366 --> 01:36:49,462
Yes. I wrote. I got an interesting
twist in the story.

1719
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:53,467
I got it.
-All the best. Bye. I'll call you soon.

1720
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:56,309
Yes. Ok. I love you.

1721
01:36:56,377 --> 01:36:59,278
I love you too. Bye.
-Bye.

1722
01:37:00,381 --> 01:37:01,473
Ok.
-Ok, fine.

1723
01:37:02,516 --> 01:37:04,416
Bye. -Bye.
-See you.

1724
01:37:10,357 --> 01:37:12,348
Come, dear.

1725
01:37:17,498 --> 01:37:21,229
Who is there... Hi, Mohak.

1726
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:24,299
Hi. What a coincidence!

1727
01:37:24,505 --> 01:37:25,472
Hi, Subrojit.

1728
01:37:27,308 --> 01:37:29,242
Where are you coming from?
-What? -I mean...

1729
01:37:29,276 --> 01:37:31,335
Anyway... so how is your life?

1730
01:37:31,412 --> 01:37:33,312
Fantastic you know!
-Yeah?

1731
01:37:33,347 --> 01:37:36,339
Brij. He's wonderful. And he's...

1732
01:37:37,284 --> 01:37:39,275
an excellent company.
-How sweet!

1733
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:40,378
I know.
-How nice.

1734
01:37:41,355 --> 01:37:42,344
Let's drink coffee.

1735
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,220
No, you know I'm tired.

1736
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:48,285
I need to take a shower.
Maybe later.

1737
01:37:48,329 --> 01:37:51,492
Ok, never mind.
We'll dine in my room.

1738
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:57,268
Sorry, Subro. But you know
today Brij has called me.

1739
01:37:57,338 --> 01:37:59,306
And he's taking me out for lunch.

1740
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:04,209
And he'll come to my
room for dinner.

1741
01:38:04,278 --> 01:38:07,338
Yes...
-He'll dine in your room.

1742
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:08,370
And lunch.

1743
01:38:08,415 --> 01:38:12,283
Ok. -Yes. I'm so sorry.
I know you're feeling bad.

1744
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:15,254
But I would've called you too.

1745
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:20,249
But you know 2 is company
and 3 is...

1746
01:38:21,395 --> 01:38:22,384
What was it?

1747
01:38:22,496 --> 01:38:26,330
3 is... crowd.
-Yes.

1748
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:29,495
Yes. But don't worry. I'll surely
take lunch with you.

1749
01:38:30,304 --> 01:38:32,204
But some other day. Ok?

1750
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:33,500
And wherever you say.

1751
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:36,467
Ok.
-Ok.

1752
01:38:37,278 --> 01:38:39,246
Bye.
-Bye.

1753
01:38:42,383 --> 01:38:44,374
Brij is a nice company.

1754
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:48,354
Brij is taking me to dinner!
You fool!

1755
01:38:58,332 --> 01:38:59,321
Thank you.

1756
01:39:10,511 --> 01:39:12,274
What happened? Eat it.

1757
01:39:17,284 --> 01:39:22,312
I don't know why my brains
say that you're Sumana.

1758
01:39:23,357 --> 01:39:26,520
But my heart says that
you can't be Sumana.

1759
01:39:28,329 --> 01:39:29,318
Listen to your heart.

1760
01:39:29,530 --> 01:39:33,296
By the way,
your brains not in place.

1761
01:39:33,534 --> 01:39:35,502
You're repeating the same thing.

1762
01:39:37,538 --> 01:39:42,339
I've lost my mind. Or else Sumana
is nothing compared to you.

1763
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:47,311
Sumana is so... conservative.

1764
01:39:48,248 --> 01:39:50,341
She can't be like you.

1765
01:39:51,318 --> 01:39:54,310
What can't she do like me?
What are you trying to say? I'm...

1766
01:39:55,389 --> 01:40:00,292
That... your affair with the poet.

1767
01:40:00,394 --> 01:40:03,295
Something is burning.

1768
01:40:03,397 --> 01:40:05,388
But I'm eating lunch with you.

1769
01:40:06,266 --> 01:40:11,260
Exactly. Lunch with someone and
dinner with someone else.

1770
01:40:12,406 --> 01:40:13,498
What's going on with Brij?

1771
01:40:14,408 --> 01:40:19,277
Brij, none of your business.
Talk about yourself.

1772
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:23,382
Ok. What if I say I want to...

1773
01:40:25,285 --> 01:40:27,276
spend the night with you?

1774
01:40:29,490 --> 01:40:32,357
Then I'll say that
you're innocent.

1775
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,328
Do you think you're my lover?

1776
01:40:38,365 --> 01:40:41,300
No God darn it! I'm your husband.

1777
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:47,272
Excuse me. Didn't I say I'm
not your Sumana? -Ok. -Ok.

1778
01:40:47,341 --> 01:40:49,241
And you can go to hell.

1779
01:40:50,244 --> 01:40:51,506
She... hey!

1780
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:17,269
You are my wife. You're my life.

1781
01:41:17,337 --> 01:41:21,874
You are my wife. You're my life.

1782
01:41:22,309 --> 01:41:26,245
You are my wife. You're my life.

1783
01:41:26,380 --> 01:41:30,510
Don't be angry, beloved.
Listen to me.

1784
01:41:31,318 --> 01:41:35,482
Listen to me.
Don't make me restless.

1785
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:39,350
You can test me.
Not just heart...

1786
01:41:39,393 --> 01:41:43,329
you can take my life too,
but come close.

1787
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:47,493
Don't be angry, beloved.
Listen to me.

1788
01:41:48,302 --> 01:41:53,239
Listen to me.
Don't make me restless.

1789
01:41:53,273 --> 01:41:56,470
You can test me.
Not just heart...

1790
01:41:56,510 --> 01:42:00,344
you can take my life too,
but come close.

1791
01:42:00,481 --> 01:42:05,316
You are my wife. You're my life.
-Are you mad?

1792
01:42:05,385 --> 01:42:10,254
You are my wife. You're my life.

1793
01:42:10,357 --> 01:42:15,294
You are my wife. You're my life.

1794
01:42:34,348 --> 01:42:43,347
I forged a bond of
love with you.

1795
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:53,257
The promise of love
is for ever.

1796
01:42:58,405 --> 01:43:03,365
Even my God knows
that I'm for you.

1797
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:08,347
Now we won't separate. Try me.

1798
01:43:08,348 --> 01:43:13,285
Don't be angry, beloved.
Listen to me.

1799
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,484
Listen to me.
Don't make me restless.

1800
01:43:17,524 --> 01:43:21,290
You can test me.
Not just heart...

1801
01:43:21,361 --> 01:43:25,297
you can take my life too,
but come close.

1802
01:43:25,465 --> 01:43:29,458
You are my wife. You're my life.

1803
01:43:30,337 --> 01:43:34,433
You are my wife. You're my life.

1804
01:43:35,309 --> 01:43:39,370
You are my wife. You're my life.

1805
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:08,298
My love, trust me.

1806
01:44:09,243 --> 01:44:18,276
I've come to give up
my life for you.

1807
01:44:23,323 --> 01:44:28,283
I will fight the world.
I can sacrifice my life.

1808
01:44:28,328 --> 01:44:33,231
I will do as you say,
tell me your wish.

1809
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:37,499
Don't be angry, beloved.
Listen to me.

1810
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:42,470
Listen to me.
Don't make me restless.

1811
01:44:43,243 --> 01:44:47,202
You can test me.
Not just heart...

1812
01:44:50,317 --> 01:44:53,218
you can take my life too,
but come close.

1813
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:58,020
You are my wife. You're my life.

1814
01:44:58,525 --> 01:45:01,255
You are my wife. You're my life.

1815
01:45:01,395 --> 01:45:04,523
Don't be angry, beloved.

1816
01:45:05,232 --> 01:45:09,328
You are my wife. You're my wife.

1817
01:45:21,348 --> 01:45:26,308
You'll hear the echo
of this slap Sumana.

1818
01:45:32,492 --> 01:45:33,481
Cobra.

1819
01:45:38,498 --> 01:45:40,489
Hello.
-Hello Cobra Sindhu.

1820
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:44,259
Karuna Sindhu.

1821
01:45:44,304 --> 01:45:48,240
Subro, where are you?

1822
01:45:48,275 --> 01:45:49,242
Goa.

1823
01:45:49,309 --> 01:45:52,335
Honeymoon. Very good.

1824
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:54,309
Honeymoon is a nice thing.

1825
01:45:55,248 --> 01:45:56,476
And how is Sumana?

1826
01:45:56,516 --> 01:45:58,381
She's fine. In London.

1827
01:45:58,518 --> 01:46:01,385
She's in London and you're in Goa.

1828
01:46:02,389 --> 01:46:04,357
So you're using internet
for honeymoon.

1829
01:46:04,424 --> 01:46:08,383
Great!
Technology has advanced so much.

1830
01:46:09,296 --> 01:46:12,356
Karuna Sindhu,
it hasn't advanced so much.

1831
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:16,267
Anyway, I need your help.
Come to Goa.

1832
01:46:16,370 --> 01:46:18,304
But son, I'm a bachelor.

1833
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:21,268
How can I help you
in your honeymoon?

1834
01:46:22,275 --> 01:46:25,244
Yes, if you say I can
send a book for you.

1835
01:46:25,512 --> 01:46:27,480
Honeymoon on internet.

1836
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:31,375
Karuna Sindhu.
Will you listen to me. -What?

1837
01:46:31,485 --> 01:46:33,350
I mean I'm missing you.

1838
01:46:35,322 --> 01:46:36,346
Come to Goa.

1839
01:46:37,257 --> 01:46:39,248
Ok, I'll come to Goa tomorrow.

1840
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,285
Tell me if you want anything.
I'll get it.

1841
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:46,492
Nothing special.
You've to bring a small thing.

1842
01:46:47,267 --> 01:46:48,461
Thing? What?

1843
01:46:55,509 --> 01:46:57,272
He's here.

1844
01:47:00,914 --> 01:47:02,311
Come.

1845
01:47:03,350 --> 01:47:04,374
Good. Thanks for coming.

1846
01:47:04,484 --> 01:47:06,349
I brought what you asked for.
-very good.

1847
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:07,478
Why is she in veil?

1848
01:47:09,389 --> 01:47:11,323
She thinks she's a big star.

1849
01:47:12,292 --> 01:47:13,486
Does she wear dresses
like stars too?

1850
01:47:14,294 --> 01:47:16,285
I doubt your intentions.
-What happened?

1851
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:18,320
You go on honeymoon
without your wife...

1852
01:47:18,365 --> 01:47:20,333
and ask me to bring
such a thing.

1853
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:23,461
Please. Have mercy, Karuna.
-Calm down.

1854
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:25,471
I'll tell you in the room.
I've booked a room for you.

1855
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:27,473
Come.
-Ok, let's go.

1856
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:41,344
How sweet of you!

1857
01:47:41,388 --> 01:47:43,288
Subro. Mr. Subro.

1858
01:47:43,356 --> 01:47:45,483
Hello.
-I didn't even see you.

1859
01:47:48,395 --> 01:47:51,364
What's the matter?
You look angry even today.

1860
01:47:51,398 --> 01:47:53,457
No. It's nothing like that.

1861
01:47:54,267 --> 01:47:58,499
I thought maybe you two
need some privacy so...

1862
01:47:59,339 --> 01:48:04,242
We thought you need privacy.

1863
01:48:04,277 --> 01:48:05,369
No, no.

1864
01:48:06,379 --> 01:48:08,244
Won't you introduce
us to your friend?

1865
01:48:08,515 --> 01:48:11,279
I forgot. So sorry.

1866
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:16,221
Riya. He's Brij Bhushan Matondkar.

1867
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:17,348
How are you?
-Hi.

1868
01:48:18,391 --> 01:48:22,259
And she's Mohak.

1869
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:25,355
She's Mohak. She's so beautiful.

1870
01:48:25,398 --> 01:48:28,333
And both of them are just friends.

1871
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:35,297
And Riya is my special friend.

1872
01:48:37,244 --> 01:48:41,305
I wanted to tell her something
special for many days.

1873
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:45,284
I thought today is a special
occasion so I should tell her.

1874
01:48:45,318 --> 01:48:50,381
Hey! This is the right time
for the right deed.

1875
01:48:50,490 --> 01:48:52,219
And beauty is here too.

1876
01:48:52,392 --> 01:48:56,226
And the hurdle of the
path is away too.

1877
01:48:56,296 --> 01:48:57,320
Not hurdle, but a slap.

1878
01:48:58,265 --> 01:49:00,256
Bye.
-Bye. -Bye.

1879
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:01,358
Hey, Subro.

1880
01:49:03,270 --> 01:49:06,330
Subro. Why are you here?

1881
01:49:06,373 --> 01:49:08,273
How come you're here?

1882
01:49:08,308 --> 01:49:12,472
I'm on holiday. Switzerland
and France is too crowded.

1883
01:49:15,348 --> 01:49:16,474
Sumana is with you too.

1884
01:49:16,516 --> 01:49:20,350
You're on honeymoon
with your wife.

1885
01:49:20,387 --> 01:49:23,254
No, I'm not Sumana. I'm Mohak.

1886
01:49:23,356 --> 01:49:25,290
She changed her name
after marriage.

1887
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:32,331
Same problem.
I'm neither Sumana nor his wife.

1888
01:49:32,465 --> 01:49:33,489
Yes.
-Yes.

1889
01:49:36,236 --> 01:49:37,225
And who are you?

1890
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:39,531
I'm Brij... -He's...
-Her friend.

1891
01:49:40,273 --> 01:49:41,240
Yes.
-You?

1892
01:49:42,242 --> 01:49:44,472
I'm Karuna Sindhu. Their friend.

1893
01:49:45,278 --> 01:49:46,506
Friend...
-Just a minute.

1894
01:49:48,281 --> 01:49:49,373
Did they two fight?

1895
01:49:50,317 --> 01:49:52,251
Believe her.
She's telling the truth.

1896
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:54,316
She's not Sumana, but Mohak.

1897
01:49:54,487 --> 01:49:56,250
What are you doing?

1898
01:49:56,323 --> 01:49:57,483
Come. Let's go.

1899
01:49:58,258 --> 01:49:59,350
Yes, sure.
-Come. -Let's go.

1900
01:49:59,492 --> 01:50:01,323
Let's also go.
-Bye.

1901
01:50:01,394 --> 01:50:03,259
Enjoy your special day.

1902
01:50:03,396 --> 01:50:04,488
Ok.
-Bye.

1903
01:50:09,302 --> 01:50:10,291
Bye.

1904
01:50:14,341 --> 01:50:19,301
God! The story is just like a movie.

1905
01:50:24,250 --> 01:50:27,481
Hello. Yes. There is one
more twist in the story.

1906
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,511
I don't want to stay here
or work with you.

1907
01:50:30,256 --> 01:50:31,382
Pay me. I'm leaving.

1908
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:34,359
What's the problem?
You'll get your money.

1909
01:50:34,394 --> 01:50:36,259
First let the work finish.

1910
01:50:36,296 --> 01:50:38,287
Work? What a work you have?

1911
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:43,325
That old man brought me here to
give lead role in a serial.

1912
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:45,463
He told me that if
you do real life...

1913
01:50:45,505 --> 01:50:47,473
acting you'll get the chance.

1914
01:50:47,507 --> 01:50:52,467
But now I feel that you're
using me for your benefit.

1915
01:50:52,545 --> 01:50:54,513
And you're definitely
up to something.

1916
01:50:55,281 --> 01:50:58,341
But now I won't work for you.
I'm leaving.

1917
01:50:59,252 --> 01:51:03,382
No. Wait. You want money.

1918
01:51:03,423 --> 01:51:06,483
Take your money.
What more do you want?

1919
01:51:10,263 --> 01:51:11,252
Hello.

1920
01:51:12,298 --> 01:51:13,458
It seems action replay
is going on.

1921
01:51:14,534 --> 01:51:19,301
No. It's nothing like that.
You're getting it wrong.

1922
01:51:19,339 --> 01:51:21,307
Actually I was telling her about...

1923
01:51:21,341 --> 01:51:23,275
the confusion with Miss Mohak.

1924
01:51:23,343 --> 01:51:27,336
I threw money like that and you
came. And you came again.

1925
01:51:28,281 --> 01:51:29,475
He's lying.

1926
01:51:30,517 --> 01:51:33,213
He brought me here for audition.

1927
01:51:33,253 --> 01:51:35,278
He's using me to make you jealous.

1928
01:51:35,488 --> 01:51:38,252
By feigning love
in front of you.

1929
01:51:38,324 --> 01:51:40,383
But I won't stay here.

1930
01:51:41,294 --> 01:51:43,319
Give my money.
I said give my money, man.

1931
01:51:43,496 --> 01:51:45,361
You liar!

1932
01:51:49,469 --> 01:51:51,437
Subro, what is wrong with you?

1933
01:51:51,504 --> 01:51:53,335
What's with you?
What are you doing?

1934
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:59,369
You... you... you know very well
why I'm doing all this.

1935
01:52:00,246 --> 01:52:02,271
What and why are you doing this?
I don't get it.

1936
01:52:02,348 --> 01:52:05,283
I can't understand you.
What's the problem?

1937
01:52:05,485 --> 01:52:08,454
When I'm in front of you,
you miss your wife.

1938
01:52:09,289 --> 01:52:11,450
And when I'm not there,
you follow me.

1939
01:52:12,958 --> 01:52:16,226
I think you should
see a psychiatrist.

1940
01:52:17,263 --> 01:52:19,231
I seriously think you should.

1941
01:52:19,532 --> 01:52:21,466
This... this...

1942
01:52:26,239 --> 01:52:28,332
Beauty always doubts love.

1943
01:52:29,409 --> 01:52:32,310
Forget it. They've this right too.

1944
01:52:35,248 --> 01:52:36,237
Bye.

1945
01:52:39,352 --> 01:52:44,312
Mad!
I'm not mad all of you're mad.

1946
01:52:45,325 --> 01:52:47,520
I tell you, there are so many
twists in the story.

1947
01:52:48,394 --> 01:52:50,453
Hang up. I'll call you later.

1948
01:52:51,331 --> 01:52:52,457
Hi.
-Forgive me.

1949
01:52:52,499 --> 01:52:53,488
Why?

1950
01:52:54,234 --> 01:52:57,226
I thought you were Sumana.
-No problem.

1951
01:52:57,270 --> 01:53:00,467
Believe me. She's just like you.

1952
01:53:00,507 --> 01:53:03,237
I know. I've been seeing
it for some days now.

1953
01:53:04,244 --> 01:53:05,506
Subro must be in illusion.

1954
01:53:06,312 --> 01:53:07,336
Yes, right.

1955
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:09,448
But he got the lesson soon.

1956
01:53:10,283 --> 01:53:12,376
Sumana, how are you?

1957
01:53:12,485 --> 01:53:14,248
I'm fine. You?

1958
01:53:14,354 --> 01:53:15,343
Hello.

1959
01:53:15,388 --> 01:53:17,219
I'm fine.

1960
01:53:19,325 --> 01:53:21,225
How are you episodes going on?

1961
01:53:21,261 --> 01:53:23,229
very well.

1962
01:53:23,363 --> 01:53:27,356
The new twist in the story
has created a sensation.

1963
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:31,266
Yes. There is lots of suspense.

1964
01:53:32,372 --> 01:53:37,469
But... on one point...

1965
01:53:37,477 --> 01:53:42,244
that now the time has come...

1966
01:53:42,348 --> 01:53:47,285
to expose the secret.

1967
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:49,345
Yes, yes.

1968
01:53:50,290 --> 01:53:51,518
Hello. Hello.

1969
01:53:52,292 --> 01:53:55,523
Hello. I can't hear you, Sumana.
-What?

1970
01:53:56,329 --> 01:53:57,455
Hello.
-Yes.

1971
01:53:58,298 --> 01:54:00,357
Hello.
-I can hear you. Speak up.

1972
01:54:01,267 --> 01:54:03,394
Hello. Hello...
-What are you saying?

1973
01:54:04,304 --> 01:54:05,532
There is network problem.

1974
01:54:08,408 --> 01:54:11,275
Hey, you?

1975
01:54:11,311 --> 01:54:14,337
Subro, what are you rambling?
-Hello. -How did you come out?

1976
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:17,372
Hello. Hello...
-Excuse me. What you doing here?

1977
01:54:17,483 --> 01:54:20,350
You're peeping in my room.

1978
01:54:20,386 --> 01:54:22,354
Subro...
-Do you want to steal something again?

1979
01:54:23,323 --> 01:54:25,257
Who is it, Subro?
What is she talking about?

1980
01:54:25,291 --> 01:54:28,454
Who? Nothing.
People are fighting far away. No.

1981
01:54:28,528 --> 01:54:29,495
Nobody is fighting.

1982
01:54:29,529 --> 01:54:32,362
Whom are you talking to?
I'm in front of you. -Hello.

1983
01:54:32,532 --> 01:54:35,296
Whom are you talking to?
-Please. -What?

1984
01:54:35,335 --> 01:54:36,495
What?
-Not to you. -Hello.

1985
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:39,334
Please.
-Tell me, what are you doing here?

1986
01:54:39,372 --> 01:54:43,502
Hello. Are you peeping
in a girl's room? -No.

1987
01:54:44,277 --> 01:54:45,539
No. I wasn't peeping.

1988
01:54:46,246 --> 01:54:48,339
You were peeping in my
room Yet you lie.

1989
01:54:48,381 --> 01:54:51,316
Hello. -What do you want
from my room? Tell me.

1990
01:54:51,351 --> 01:54:52,340
What is this?

1991
01:54:53,253 --> 01:54:54,242
Hello.

1992
01:54:54,387 --> 01:54:55,411
Sumana.

1993
01:54:55,488 --> 01:55:00,289
Yes.
She's your Sumana. So tell her...

1994
01:55:00,326 --> 01:55:03,352
what you're doing? First you
tried to make me your wife.

1995
01:55:03,496 --> 01:55:06,488
Who is this girl?
-And later you brought Riya.

1996
01:55:06,532 --> 01:55:09,467
Hello.
-Stop rambling. What's your problem?

1997
01:55:10,270 --> 01:55:12,329
What's going on?
-No.

1998
01:55:12,372 --> 01:55:13,498
Yes, yes. -No.

1999
01:55:14,274 --> 01:55:17,243
Tell her. The voices are
coming from TV. -TV?

2000
01:55:17,277 --> 01:55:18,266
Someone was watching serial.

2001
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:22,338
Now channel is changed.
Spiderman is coming.

2002
01:55:22,382 --> 01:55:25,374
No. I'll tell Sumana what you're up to.
-Listen.

2003
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:27,308
Listen to me.

2004
01:55:27,387 --> 01:55:30,356
Subrojit Chakravarty,
no need to tell me.

2005
01:55:30,356 --> 01:55:32,256
I understood everything.

2006
01:55:32,292 --> 01:55:34,385
No!
-Now I'm disconnecting.

2007
01:55:34,494 --> 01:55:36,485
No. -Shut up! Go to hell.
-What this?

2008
01:55:37,263 --> 01:55:41,290
Shut up! Now you know that
I'm not your Sumana.

2009
01:55:41,334 --> 01:55:45,236
Yeah! -It's very great!
-Thank you.

2010
01:55:45,305 --> 01:55:47,239
Give it to me. Yes.

2011
01:55:47,407 --> 01:55:48,499
Thank you.
-Give sweets.

2012
01:55:49,275 --> 01:55:53,473
Congratulations, Anekta.
-Thanks. Nandita, we've done it.

2013
01:55:54,280 --> 01:55:56,248
The next slot is also ours.

2014
01:55:56,349 --> 01:55:58,510
But Subro hasn't send
the script of 52nd...

2015
01:55:59,252 --> 01:56:01,277
episode and tomorrow
is telecast.

2016
01:56:01,487 --> 01:56:04,217
Ok. I'll tell him just now.

2017
01:56:10,496 --> 01:56:11,485
Hello, madam.

2018
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:14,495
We've done it. Ye.

2019
01:56:15,301 --> 01:56:18,429
The TRP of your show has
made such a record...

2020
01:56:18,504 --> 01:56:22,304
that people are eagerly waiting
for the 52nd episode.

2021
01:56:22,375 --> 01:56:24,366
I want a sensational climax.

2022
01:56:25,244 --> 01:56:28,509
And such a climax should surpass
all the other serials. Yes.

2023
01:56:29,315 --> 01:56:31,340
And now just go out and chill.

2024
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:35,344
You've done a fantastic job.

2025
01:56:36,289 --> 01:56:38,484
Thank you, madam.
-Ok, Shu.

2026
01:56:38,524 --> 01:56:42,392

I know you're stressed out.

01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:54,365
Tomorrow we'll shoot

01:57:07,253 --> 01:57:08,242
Sure. I'll.

2035
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:10,219
Yes.
-Fine. And all the best.

2036
01:57:18,331 --> 01:57:20,458
Your story is interesting,
Mr. Subro.

2037
01:57:21,467 --> 01:57:23,332
You made a legend of a real life.

2038
01:57:23,536 --> 01:57:25,401
You made viewers crazy.

2039
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:29,508
Now I'm roaming like crazy myself,
Mr. Brij.

2040
01:57:30,510 --> 01:57:32,478
You know the entire story
Yet you're laughing.

2041
01:57:34,280 --> 01:57:36,305
My life ended before climax.

2042
01:57:37,417 --> 01:57:40,386
52nd episode.

2043
01:57:41,287 --> 01:57:42,481
I can't write it. You do it.

2044
01:57:43,356 --> 01:57:44,380
But how can I write it?

2045
01:57:45,358 --> 01:57:49,260
What are you saying?
You smoke so well.

2046
01:57:49,295 --> 01:57:50,353
You can write too.

2047
01:57:50,496 --> 01:57:54,489
I mean you say such nice poems...

2048
01:57:55,368 --> 01:57:57,359
you can write it.
It'll be done. Ok.

2049
01:57:57,537 --> 01:58:00,370
Ok.
I'll write. But on one condition.

2050
01:58:00,473 --> 01:58:01,440
Tell me.

2051
01:58:01,507 --> 01:58:04,237
You won't read what I'll write.

2052
01:58:04,377 --> 01:58:05,469
I'll mail directly.

2053
01:58:06,412 --> 01:58:10,439
What? Writer won't read and
episode will be mailed.

2054
01:58:10,516 --> 01:58:12,347
What are you saying?

2055
01:58:13,319 --> 01:58:14,343
It happens in TV serials.

2056
01:58:16,355 --> 01:58:17,344
Surprise for you.

2057
01:58:17,390 --> 01:58:20,359
Yes, ok.
But I've one condition too.

2058
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:27,299
You know it's 52nd episode.
It should be... -Sensational.

2059
01:58:27,366 --> 01:58:28,526
Yes. Sensational.

2060
01:58:30,236 --> 01:58:31,225
One more condition.

2061
01:58:32,405 --> 01:58:37,308
Even if it's not sensational,
it should be mailed by 5 am.

2062
01:58:38,277 --> 01:58:40,302
Done. It will be mailed.

2063
01:58:51,290 --> 01:58:52,279
Coming.

2064
01:58:54,293 --> 01:58:55,351
Yes, Mohak. What do you want?

2065
01:58:59,232 --> 01:59:02,463
Mohak. Sumana, remember?

2066
01:59:03,503 --> 01:59:05,471
My God! Yes. Goddess.

2067
01:59:06,339 --> 01:59:08,398
My Goddess!

2068
01:59:09,275 --> 01:59:12,244
Sumana. You're here?

2069
01:59:12,278 --> 01:59:14,212
Why are you surprised to see me?

2070
01:59:15,515 --> 01:59:18,484
I'm not surprised.
I'm very happy and excited.

2071
01:59:19,252 --> 01:59:20,446
You came from London suddenly.

2072
01:59:21,320 --> 01:59:23,345
Now that you're here, come in.

2073
01:59:23,389 --> 01:59:27,382
Where is she? Show me.
Where did you hide her? -Who?

2074
01:59:27,460 --> 01:59:28,449
Mohak!
-Mohak?

2075
01:59:28,528 --> 01:59:31,258
Yes.
-Why will I hide Mohak here?

2076
01:59:31,297 --> 01:59:33,356
I don't know her.
She's just an ordinary girl.

2077
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:35,264
I know she's a girl.

2078
01:59:35,334 --> 01:59:37,325
I heard you on the phone.
-What did you hear?

2079
01:59:37,336 --> 01:59:40,237
I thought... that...
-What?

2080
01:59:40,339 --> 01:59:43,365
Room? What? -At night...
-At night in my room...

2081
01:59:43,543 --> 01:59:45,511
No, dear. Not even once.

2082
01:59:46,245 --> 01:59:49,271
I didn't even tried. Honestly.

2083
01:59:49,315 --> 01:59:50,475
You tried to try...
-No...

2084
01:59:51,517 --> 01:59:53,314
I hate you. You're such a cheap!

2085
01:59:53,352 --> 01:59:56,287
No, no. Sumana...
-Yes. -Stop it.

2086
01:59:56,289 --> 01:59:58,382
I didn't cheat. I swear.

2087
01:59:58,491 --> 02:00:00,356
I'm confused ever since
I came here.

2088
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:03,453
If both of you're in the same
place then... -Stop it.

2089
02:00:03,529 --> 02:00:07,397
She... both of you look so much
similar that... -Shut up!

2090
02:00:08,334 --> 02:00:10,302
How long will do this
drama of double role?

2091
02:00:10,336 --> 02:00:13,328
First you were in double role,
then I? You're mad.

2092
02:00:13,372 --> 02:00:17,433
No, Sumana. I swear. I didn't
do any double role this time.

2093
02:00:21,347 --> 02:00:24,407
One more lie. -No.
-You can't prove your words.

2094
02:00:25,418 --> 02:00:27,386
I can do it. -No.
-I can prove it.

2095
02:00:27,386 --> 02:00:29,286
Yes. Thank God you came.

2096
02:00:29,355 --> 02:00:30,481
I'll prove it today.

2097
02:00:30,523 --> 02:00:33,492
What will you prove.
-Come with me. -Subro.

2098
02:00:33,526 --> 02:00:36,222
She'll be dazzled.
Now she'll believe me.

2099
02:00:36,262 --> 02:00:37,490
Dear, she's Mohak.

2100
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:41,489
Mohak, open the door.
See who is here.

2101
02:00:43,302 --> 02:00:44,291
Mohak.

2102
02:00:44,403 --> 02:00:45,427
Sir.
-Mohak.

2103
02:00:45,504 --> 02:00:46,471
What?

2104
02:00:47,240 --> 02:00:48,229
Madam has checked out.

2105
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:52,370
What?
When? When did she check out?

2106
02:00:52,478 --> 02:00:53,445
This morning.

2107
02:00:57,383 --> 02:00:59,351
Never mind. Come here.

2108
02:00:59,385 --> 02:01:03,253
Look. Isn't it? Isn't it?

2109
02:01:04,290 --> 02:01:06,315
Same height. Same face.
Only attire is diff.

2110
02:01:06,392 --> 02:01:09,452
Except glasses and tresses she
is like the madam who was here.

2111
02:01:09,528 --> 02:01:12,520
Tell her that.
Tell her. I too was confused.

2112
02:01:13,266 --> 02:01:15,325
He too got confused.
-That madam looked very different.

2113
02:01:15,368 --> 02:01:16,357
You know that.

2114
02:01:23,476 --> 02:01:26,274
Lie. Lie. Why are you lying?

2115
02:01:26,312 --> 02:01:29,281
Why are you scolding him?
It isn't his fault.

2116
02:01:29,515 --> 02:01:30,504
Liar!

2117
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:32,239
He's lying.

2118
02:01:33,352 --> 02:01:34,376
It's not my fault.

2119
02:01:34,487 --> 02:01:38,446
Sumana. Sumana, he's lying. Why
don't you understand me?

2120
02:01:38,524 --> 02:01:41,391
Please. I'm... Sumana, wait for me.

2121
02:01:42,295 --> 02:01:45,287
So sorry. Sorry.

2122
02:01:45,364 --> 02:01:48,299
Sumana!
Sumana, you can't go like this.

2123
02:01:48,334 --> 02:01:51,269
Sumana, let me explain.

2124
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:55,331
Sumana. Sumana, look. They're
lying. Why don't you trust me?

2125
02:01:55,408 --> 02:01:58,377
I'm not lying.
They're fooling you. -Sumana.

2126
02:01:58,411 --> 02:02:01,471
Your car will be punctured. Flight
will be cancelled. Just come back.

2127
02:02:02,281 --> 02:02:04,306
Sumana. God!

2128
02:02:07,286 --> 02:02:12,280
Sumana!
My darling! Why did you leave me?

2129
02:02:13,326 --> 02:02:17,456
I can't drink without you.
I mean I can't live without you.

2130
02:02:22,501 --> 02:02:26,494
2 lovers in the forest...

2131
02:02:33,346 --> 02:02:34,313
Hello.

2132
02:02:35,548 --> 02:02:37,243
It's Brij.

2133
02:02:37,516 --> 02:02:41,350
Brij. How are you?

2134
02:02:42,355 --> 02:02:44,323
I hope you're happy.

2135
02:02:46,525 --> 02:02:50,222
Tell me. How did you call?

2136
02:02:50,262 --> 02:02:53,231
Your 52nd episode is telecast.
Watch it.

2137
02:02:55,334 --> 02:02:57,495
Serial of my life is off air.

2138
02:02:58,404 --> 02:03:00,497
Now what's the use of watching
this episode.

2139
02:03:01,540 --> 02:03:04,509
Anyway, thanks for reminding.

2140
02:03:05,378 --> 02:03:07,278
I'll see and tell you.
-Thank you.

2141
02:03:07,346 --> 02:03:08,438
It's taken the efforts of...

2142
02:03:13,285 --> 02:03:15,412
I'll prove.
Look who has come to meet you.

2143
02:03:15,488 --> 02:03:17,353
Sir, this madam has checked out.

2144
02:03:17,390 --> 02:03:19,221
What are you saying?

2145
02:03:19,358 --> 02:03:21,451
Tell me,
did you ever see this madam?

2146
02:03:21,527 --> 02:03:23,358
Why do you keep lying to me?

2147
02:03:23,496 --> 02:03:25,487
Isn't this madam just
like madam Kumkum?

2148
02:03:28,534 --> 02:03:30,229
This...

2149
02:03:31,537 --> 02:03:33,505
That madam looks diff.
You know it, sir.

2150
02:03:34,273 --> 02:03:36,503
Look carefully.
-What can I do about it, sir?

2151
02:03:36,542 --> 02:03:40,342
You make either your double
role or mine. I'm leaving.

2152
02:03:42,381 --> 02:03:45,475
This... this is

2153
02:03:45,518 --> 02:03:48,282
Listen to me. Please.

2154
02:03:48,287 --> 02:03:49,345
This... this...

2155
02:03:54,360 --> 02:03:57,488
Hi, Rohit. -Rimjhim, you're
here at this time?

2156
02:04:03,269 --> 02:04:05,237
I came to give you good news.

2157
02:04:05,271 --> 02:04:06,295
Good news.
-Yes.

2158
02:04:07,239 --> 02:04:09,366
Tell me quickly.

2159
02:04:09,475 --> 02:04:11,238
You're going to become a father.

2160
02:04:11,310 --> 02:04:15,246
Rimjhim! I love you so much.

2161
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:16,339
I love you.

2162
02:04:30,396 --> 02:04:31,420
What?

2163
02:04:43,275 --> 02:04:45,368
What happened?
Whatever you see is true.

2164
02:04:46,512 --> 02:04:49,345
You're going to become a father.
-No.

2165
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:51,279
Yes.
-How?

2166
02:04:52,284 --> 02:04:53,444
I mean. Please...

2167
02:04:56,522 --> 02:04:58,217
God!

2168
02:05:04,263 --> 02:05:06,254
You too...
-Tell me.

2169
02:05:06,532 --> 02:05:09,296
Tell me the entire story
in fast forward.

2170
02:05:21,480 --> 02:05:23,277
First egg or chicken came?

2171
02:05:23,382 --> 02:05:27,443
I mean, you'll tell me what
and how you did all that.

2172
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:32,484
First let me tell you that
your plot was nice.

2173
02:05:33,425 --> 02:05:35,359
You confused me totally.

2174
02:05:36,529 --> 02:05:38,224
Laugh.

2175
02:05:38,364 --> 02:05:40,389
First of all I'm not Brij.

2176
02:05:41,233 --> 02:05:42,222
What?

2177
02:05:42,268 --> 02:05:45,260
I'm not what you think.

2178
02:05:46,338 --> 02:05:48,203
I'll explain clearly.

2179
02:05:48,507 --> 02:05:51,271
I'll explain everything in detail.

2180
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:52,277
Please.

2181
02:05:52,545 --> 02:05:56,242
I'm Sangeeta's fiancée.
My name is Aryan.

2182
02:05:56,248 --> 02:05:59,217
I love to write.
I travel for business.

2183
02:05:59,351 --> 02:06:00,375
So Mr. Subro...

2184
02:06:01,387 --> 02:06:02,376
To take revenge...

2185
02:06:02,421 --> 02:06:06,323
Sangeeta and Sumana made a plan
to go to London. -I see.

2186
02:06:06,358 --> 02:06:09,350
At that time you thought
of going to Goa. -Yes.

2187
02:06:09,395 --> 02:06:10,453
But remember...

2188
02:06:11,397 --> 02:06:14,491
more than revenge she wanted
to help you out. -True.

2189
02:06:15,267 --> 02:06:17,360
She wanted to fill new
colours in your story.

2190
02:06:17,403 --> 02:06:18,370
I see.

2191
02:06:19,271 --> 02:06:21,364
Take this. SIM card of London.

2192
02:06:21,407 --> 02:06:22,499
If you phone with this...

2193
02:06:22,541 --> 02:06:25,305
Subro will believe that
you're in London.

2194
02:06:25,511 --> 02:06:27,376
Second idea was of
Sangeeta and mine.

2195
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:31,281
As per that I met you as Brij.

2196
02:06:32,318 --> 02:06:35,287
We wanted to make your serial
more interesting.

2197
02:06:35,387 --> 02:06:37,480
TRP should rise on telecast.

2198
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:44,260
You'll got there as Brij Bhushan,
writer cum tourist.

2199
02:06:47,299 --> 02:06:50,234
It seems your lover will
get thrashed by them.

2200
02:06:51,503 --> 02:06:54,336
Nothing like that will happen.
His show will be a hit.

2201
02:06:55,341 --> 02:06:56,501
I'm starting to understand
the game.

2202
02:06:57,376 --> 02:06:59,241
But I don't get one thing.

2203
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:03,346
When I was talking to
Sumana on phone...

2204
02:07:03,382 --> 02:07:05,441
and peeping in Mohak's room...

2205
02:07:06,485 --> 02:07:08,316
Mohak has stopped me.

2206
02:07:09,254 --> 02:07:13,350
And Sumana was also on the phone.
How did you do this?

2207
02:07:13,425 --> 02:07:16,292
Sangeeta can deceive anyone
with her skill.

2208
02:07:16,428 --> 02:07:20,364
Not just Sumana,
she can mimic our voice too.

2209
02:07:20,399 --> 02:07:22,264
Hello. Hi, Subro.

2210
02:07:22,301 --> 02:07:26,237
Hey, Sumana. How are you?
-I'm fine. You?

2211
02:07:26,338 --> 02:07:27,362
Absolutely fine.

2212
02:07:29,274 --> 02:07:31,333
How are you episodes going on?

2213
02:07:31,377 --> 02:07:33,277
very well.

2214
02:07:33,312 --> 02:07:37,271
The new twist in the story
has created sensation.

2215
02:07:37,383 --> 02:07:39,317
Ok. Congrats.

2216
02:07:39,518 --> 02:07:43,352
All of you fooled me.

2217
02:07:45,257 --> 02:07:47,487
But along with that you
made my show a big hit.

2218
02:07:48,293 --> 02:07:51,387
So I forgive you all generously.

2219
02:07:52,364 --> 02:07:54,264
Come on, Subro.
Do you've another choice?

2220
02:07:54,333 --> 02:07:55,322
You've to.

2221
02:07:55,367 --> 02:07:56,493
I love you.

2222
02:07:57,336 --> 02:07:58,325
I love you too.

2223
02:07:58,504 --> 02:08:03,498
Our Karuna was left out.
He enjoyed all the drama secretly.

2224
02:08:04,543 --> 02:08:07,410
He acted as if he was
Subro' friend.

2225
02:08:08,247 --> 02:08:11,410
On the other hand he gave
all report to Anekta.

2226
02:08:11,517 --> 02:08:13,212
What?

2227
02:08:13,252 --> 02:08:15,220
You're wrong, Brij Bhushan.

2228
02:08:16,422 --> 02:08:19,255
I don't deceive my friends.

2229
02:08:20,259 --> 02:08:23,353
I'm a lover, but a spy.

2230
02:08:23,995 --> 02:08:25,360
Well said.

2231
02:08:25,464 --> 02:08:28,331
Then with whom did you
used to talk secretly?

2232
02:08:28,534 --> 02:08:34,473
That beauty is my dream girl.

2233
02:08:35,274 --> 02:08:36,241
I got it.

2234
02:08:36,408 --> 02:08:38,239
She's Miss Mirchandani.

2235
02:08:38,377 --> 02:08:39,344
Right?

2236
02:08:39,511 --> 02:08:46,314
I said everything to her
except one thing.

2237
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:48,308
What?

2238
02:08:48,387 --> 02:08:51,322
I wanted to tell her, Mirchandani.

2239
02:08:51,356 --> 02:08:54,257
You're hot. I love you.
-Hot?

2240
02:08:54,493 --> 02:08:57,462
But unfortunately I couldn't say so.

2241
02:08:58,330 --> 02:08:59,354
You said it.

2242
02:08:59,531 --> 02:09:01,226
Meaning.

2243
02:09:01,366 --> 02:09:02,355
Look there.

2244
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:10,800
Subtitles: Arigon

2245
02:09:12,377 --> 02:09:14,345
Idiot. Stupid! Fool!

2246
02:09:14,379 --> 02:09:15,368
Gone!

2247
02:09:15,414 --> 02:09:17,245
What were you saying? Tell me.

2248
02:09:24,323 --> 02:09:27,258
If you act like this,
people will change the channel.

2249
02:09:27,292 --> 02:09:28,486
You want to say, I love you?

2250
02:09:30,395 --> 02:09:31,419
Even I love you.

2251
02:09:32,297 --> 02:09:36,233
Great!
-It's done.

2252
02:09:46,278 --> 02:09:51,306
You are my wife. You're my life.

2253
02:09:51,517 --> 02:09:56,052
You are my wife. You're my life.

2254
02:09:56,355 --> 02:10:00,223
You are my wife. You're my life.

2255
02:10:00,459 --> 02:10:05,260
Don't be angry, beloved.
Listen to me.

2256
02:10:05,330 --> 02:10:10,290
Listen to me.
Don't make me restless.

2257
02:10:10,335 --> 02:10:12,269
You can test me.

2258
02:10:12,304 --> 02:10:17,367
Not just heart,
take my life but come closer.

2259
02:10:36,461 --> 02:10:41,330
I will fight the world.
I can sacrifice my life.

2260
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:46,369
I will do as you say,
tell me your wish.

2261
02:10:46,505 --> 02:10:51,340
Don't be angry, beloved.
Listen to me.

2262
02:10:51,376 --> 02:10:56,245
Listen to me.
Don't make me restless.

2263
02:10:56,281 --> 02:10:58,249
You can test me.

2264
02:10:58,283 --> 02:11:03,414
Not just heart,
take my life but come closer.

2265
02:11:03,488 --> 02:11:06,355
Don't be angry, beloved.

2266
02:11:06,391 --> 02:11:12,296
You are my wife. You're my life.

2267
02:11:12,331 --> 02:11:15,266
You are my life.

2268
02:17:12,821 --> 02:17:16,655
Sometimes I saw in shade...

2269
02:17:19,628 --> 02:17:22,654
Sometimes I saw in sun...

2270
02:17:25,600 --> 02:17:27,795
Sometimes I saw in shade...

2271
02:17:28,637 --> 02:17:30,832
Sometimes I saw in sun...

2272
02:17:31,606 --> 02:17:37,670
I've seen life in diff forms.

2273
02:17:37,779 --> 02:17:43,740
It is filled with merriment
and problems.

2274
02:17:43,785 --> 02:17:46,811
The season is erratic too.

2275
02:17:46,855 --> 02:17:49,756
What's this world?

2276
02:17:49,791 --> 02:17:53,818
Idiot box! Idiot box!

2277
02:17:55,630 --> 02:17:59,794
Idiot box! Idiot box!

2278
02:18:20,822 --> 02:18:26,761
There is disloyalty
in name of loyalty.

2279
02:18:26,795 --> 02:18:32,791
There is celebration
and mourning too.

2280
02:18:36,671 --> 02:18:42,610
There is disloyalty
in name of loyalty.

2281
02:18:42,644 --> 02:18:48,674
There is celebration
and mourning too.

2282
02:18:48,717 --> 02:18:51,686
Relationships are shattered now.

2283
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:54,712
There is fake love
in very heart.

2284
02:18:54,756 --> 02:18:57,725
Trust is in danger.

2285
02:18:57,759 --> 02:19:00,626
What's this world?

2286
02:19:00,662 --> 02:19:04,723
Idiot box! Idiot box!

2287
02:19:05,867 --> 02:19:10,770
Idiot box! Idiot box!

2288
02:19:25,687 --> 02:19:31,648
Everyone is estranged here.

2289
02:19:31,726 --> 02:19:37,790
Even kin is unaware of us.

2290
02:19:40,769 --> 02:19:46,674
Everyone is estranged here.

2291
02:19:46,775 --> 02:19:52,680
Even kin are unaware of us.

2292
02:19:52,814 --> 02:19:55,783
There is a mask on every face.

2293
02:19:55,851 --> 02:19:59,582
Eyes hold illusions.

2294
02:19:59,621 --> 02:20:02,590
There is dilemma too.

2295
02:20:02,724 --> 02:20:04,715
What's this world?

2296
02:20:04,726 --> 02:20:08,753
Idiot box! Idiot box!

2297
02:20:10,699 --> 02:20:15,659
Idiot box! Idiot box!
