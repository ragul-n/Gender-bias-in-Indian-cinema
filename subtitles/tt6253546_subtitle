3
00:02:00,854 --> 00:02:03,118
Without knowing what awaits us in the next
moment

4
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,559
We travel every day, every night..

5
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,658
My travel was not alone..

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,398
Hmm..

7
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:16,068
Nobody's life is ever alone..

8
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,839
We had a band in our college - Role Models

9
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,740

00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,050
The name given by his father was Papachan.

13
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,579
He changed his name and made it modern..
Rexxie!

14
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:38,991

That will be known in due course...

Hey.. What is this .. Gun..

00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,876
The days of knives and daggers are over..

17
00:03:01,581 --> 00:03:02,548
Now its time..

18
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:04,682
Made in Kamatipadam.

19
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,681
-You made it!!-Yes..

20
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,751
-Does it work?-Work! Eh!

21
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,546
Hey idiot! lt sheds blood..

22
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:11,984
-You want to see..-Yeah

23
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,023
Let blood be shed..

24
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:15,557
Yes..

25
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,025
Boss.. taking quiet some time..

26
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:19,595
Any oiling needed?

27
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,267
Oh.. Haa...ha...

28
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:26,567

Hey... did not hit..

32
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:39,849
Hey Rexxie...l want you too to hear this..

33
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,884
lf this man makes any more guns here..

34
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,816
Honestly l will inform the police..

35
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,090
Sure do inform the police..

36
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:46,258
Who will go in is your father..

37
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,890
That lathe shop is in his name..

38
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:51,559
l was promised that as dowry.
Till now it has not been transferred..

39
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,026
Next l will make a cannon..

40
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:54,823
This man will never get good....

41
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:57,267
Don't worry...

42
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:59,596
Just take the white of the egg..
You will be good..

43
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:00,863
Yess....

44
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,107
Now tell me why you came..

45
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,969
Do you recall our old Professor?. Sekharan Sir..

46
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:07,040
Yes.. Did he pass away?

47
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:10,146
No.. He had called me.

48
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:12,515
-Why?-He wanted to meet us..

49
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,277
-And then..-l said we will..

50
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:15,586
You Agreed..

51
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:19,287
That lousy fellow damaged ourfuture..

52
00:04:19,626 --> 00:04:20,593
Have you forgotten the past?

53
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,590
-Not that l forgot!-Then..

54
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:25,764
-The place where he wanted to meet ...
-ls it your dad's graveyard?

55
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,192
lf he had said that, l would have declined..

56
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:30,192
This is a bar in a 5 star hotel..

57
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,571
When l heard that l could not disagree..

58
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:35,103
How long is it that we have been taking
this mixture of wine and beer?

59
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,902
l have got fed up, Jyothi! Fed up!

60
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,679
Shameless. A spineless beggar..

61
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,113
l loathe you..You go and swig..

62
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,182
lf necessary, l shall come along..

63
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,856
Sir, why is it that you wanted to meet us?

64
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:58,996
Sir if you have called us to apologise...

65
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,096
Then we are not interested..

66
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:02,096
-You can pay the bill and leave..-Leave...

67
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,200
What l have to say is about Gautham..

68
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,773
-About Gautham??-What is the matter with
him?

69
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,002
He is not the old Gautham..

70
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,301
He has changed completely..

71
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,170
He is in a complicated stage now..

72
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:18,049
Has he been into drinking and become
addicted?

73
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,309
Na.. No..

74
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,675
ls it stuff or substance?

75
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:22,149
-Na.. No..-Not even that...

76
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:23,680
Then what is the issue..

77
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,254
Say..

78
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:25,750
Come on..Tell me.

79
00:05:40,406 --> 00:05:41,873
How was my sleep?

80
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:51,079
What is my appointment for today?

81
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:55,743
Who is that girl?

82
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:02,721
All he talks isjust with the telephone
assistant...

83
00:06:03,429 --> 00:06:04,760
How is the weather today?

84
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:06,996
Way to office..

85
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,007
No..

86
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,014
Tell me about life in planet Mars..

87
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:35,385
Hey Gautham! You are sitting here!

88
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,390
There company's Annual Day celebrations are
on..

89
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:40,790
-Come on...-No..l am busy..

90
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,899
Come on Gautham, lets have fun..

91
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,396
Busy..

92
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:47,868
Ok..

93
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,144
As parent generally think...

94
00:06:53,446 --> 00:06:56,904
guessed a marriage could bring in a change..

95
00:06:57,183 --> 00:07:00,209
Do you remember Ravi Uncle's daughter,
Kavitha?

96
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,015
She has just completed her MDS.

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,389
Arranged Marriage!

98
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,385
Dad has given his word..

99
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,020
How about speaking with her!

100
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:09,384
Tomorrow 5 pm, Public Library..

101
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:12,296
Wouldn't some coffee shop or mall be better?.

102
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:13,991
Public Library.

103
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,294
Gautham, do you remember when we met last?

104
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,874
-At Papa's... niece's.-Shh... sh..

105
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:23,801
wedd..ing..

106
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,975
Then you were studying..

107
00:07:27,847 --> 00:07:29,474
You also sang a song, remember!

108
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,342
-My heart's...-Hey softly..softly..

109
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,010
You were so funny then

110
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,052
What is it? A mood off.

111
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,860
No fun here..Could we go out?

112
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,059
To the mall outside..

113
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:44,318
Come we can go to Mall..

114
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,228
What are you doing?

115
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:48,491
Beyond this is one's private space.

116
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,028
lt requires permission to intrude into that
space..

117
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,801
How could you simply pull hands and legs?

118
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,039
Such people are called with a different name..

119
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:55,899
What do you think of yourself?.

120
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:57,773
He insulted my daughter..

121
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:01,138
He behaved as if she is a flirtatious girl..

122
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,143
No he is not that kind...

123
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:04,883
No.. he is not that kind....

124
00:08:05,184 --> 00:08:06,879
He is the other kind...Gay.. Gay..

125
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,785
What all are you saying?

126
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:15,153
Dude...if after 20 years if a guy
is not attracted to the opposite sex..

127
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,419
Then it is definitely the other kind..

128
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,854
Don't say such stupidity, Mr. Ravi..

129
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:23,999
l got married at the age of 29

130
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:28,139
Till then l was never attracted
to the opposite sex at all..

131
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:30,204
Even after marriage he did not..

132
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:33,344
-See...-What?

133
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,077
So Sir you neverfelt..

134
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,320
That is not the topic now..

135
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,317
lsn't our topic Gautham?

136
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:52,057
For some time now, he has been behaving odd..

137
00:08:52,932 --> 00:08:56,993
lf as he said there is a perversion,

138
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,059
l do not understand that

139
00:08:59,605 --> 00:09:02,904
lf you are there, you can understand him easily

140
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,337
This is his visiting card.

141
00:09:07,947 --> 00:09:09,073
Office address is in it..

142
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,043
We will meet him..

143
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,577
Not for you, Sir.. For him..

144
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:20,989
Just go straight and then next left..

145
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,190
-Here you have centralized AC..
-What is your name?

146
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:25,325
Please..

147
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,062
Yes...

148
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:36,073
We were meeting him after quiet some years..

149
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:38,443
We expected him to come running and hug us.

150
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:39,168
But..

151
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,045
Jothish Narayan and Rexxie joseph..

152
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,044
Please..

153
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,477
Even l had forgotten my dad's name..

154
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:46,145
He has got a great memory.

155
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,318
So what brings you here?

156
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,088

Bottle in the office!!
Who said he has turned around!

163
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:08,006
The problem is with his dad..

164
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,901
-Nothing with him..He is just cunnng..

165

Having it direct..Correct measure...

00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,148

169
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,084

How is it?

172
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,325
This is not Vodka..

173
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,322
-Then -lt is the other stuff..

174
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:32,325
Local brew?

175
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,997
Plain water..

176
00:10:34,233 --> 00:10:35,427
The most purest water..

177
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:37,894
You know..

178
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,268
A person must take a minimum of
8 litres of water daily..

179
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,904
And then..

180
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,442
Then it needs to peed out..

181
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,580
Sir..

182
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:55,011
Who is it? Who is it?
Who is it? Any problems!!

183
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,588
Should we step out?

184
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,424
Mr. Gautham, are you an idiot or something?

185
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,523
Aren't you ashamed?

186
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:02,660
Of committing such a stupidity and face me..

187
00:11:03,062 --> 00:11:04,256
Now we have missed the deadline..

188
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:05,621
You need not have any responsibility..

189
00:11:06,232 --> 00:11:07,460
-Excuse me..-Yes...

190
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,065
You should leave now..

191
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,266
Doesn't Gautham work well around here?

192
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:13,366
Why is he being shouted at?

193
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:16,733
lt is just Gautham's contribution
that sustains this company..

194
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,610
Then why is it that Gautham is being scolded?

195
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,568
Some sadistic pleasure.. what else!

196
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,172
-Pleasure?-yes

197
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,575
The boss just wants to shine in front of
everybody..

198
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,342
This drama takes place at irregular intervals..

199
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,519
Moreover Gautham never responds..
That's why

200
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,246
The old Gautham would have plastered him to
the wall.

201
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,558
-Let me do that...-Sh.. No..

202
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,249
That is actually not required...

203
00:11:35,628 --> 00:11:36,720
The boss is actually getting it...

204
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:41,199
The other day he shouted at Gautham
and the same day his arm broke..

205
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,368
lt is the punishment meted out by the
Almighty is what all are saying..

206
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:45,228
Who is this Almighty...

207
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,769
The guy in the office above?

208
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,465
-Dude.. God..-GOD..

209
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:52,667
You have started giving God freaking names..

210
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,579
Whatever l say you stay with
your head hanging down.

211
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,739
-One...Ahh...Get out...-Ok sir

212
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,092
We were expelled from college so that he turns
good..

213
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,435
lt seems he has become more than good..

214
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,364
Now we are been called to turn
him back to his old self..

215
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,366
Whatever it be.. What has happened to him?

216
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,240
Can't believe him to be our old Gautham.

217
00:12:32,785 --> 00:12:35,083
Dear.. this brother has not got a mother's love..

218
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,752
So why don't you sing a lullaby
and put me to sleep..

219
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,647
Hello... stop this...

220
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:40,751
No ragging can be allowed here..

221
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:42,285
Who are you? Get lost..

222
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,754
-Stop this...-You get lost..

223
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,465
Move.. Move..

224
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:47,121
What happened?

225
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,601
He.. has not got his mother's love..

226
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,293
So he wants her to sing a lullaby

227
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:53,605
Weren't you who won the first prize
in the lullaby competition?

228
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:54,602
Yes it is me ..

229
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:57,169

''Friendship, friendship''

353
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,240
Ask Gautham to stay away from the crowd!

354
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,312
How can that be? Gautham is the leader..

355
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:56,677
Haven't l told you, it is not him,
but the boys with him..

356
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,297
Sir, it is not Gautham.

We will tell him..

The paper says that my daughter committed
suicide because of a love failure..

361
00:21:20,646 --> 00:21:21,738
This is all blatant lies..

362
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:24,343
She had prepared very well forthe exams..

363
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:29,114
Being insulted in front of all the students,
hurt her and forced her to do the extreme step

364
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:31,986
There are no relations as stated here..

365
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:34,983
This is management's failure..

366
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:37,792
Just to save theirfaces, all these cooked up
stories..

367
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:48,667
Hey.. Stop for now..

368
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,637
Though we did so much.. not
a single soul told the truth..

369
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:56,744
Many students here know that girl was
asked to stand out for not paying the fees.

370
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,344
But not a single one spoke..
Everyone is scared..

371
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:00,616
Why wouldn't they be scared?

372
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,717
lsn't that how they are brought up?

373
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,089
Whatever happens, just keep quiet and reach
home..

374
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,780
Those are the nice guys..smart ones..

375
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:11,254
lf anyone involves in an issue,
then he gets to be the scoundrel..

376
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,329
Our parents are moulding a timid,
non-reactive set of youths..

377
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,634
Dear you don't be pained...

378
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,866
We have done everything that is possible of
us...

379
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:24,400
-Ain't we?-Yeah..

380
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,640
What more do we do?

381
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,275
That is not enough..

382
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:28,140
What else..

383
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:28,869
Do you see this!

384
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,343
A complaint addressed to the Police
Commissioner..

385
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,342
l am going to file a case..

386
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,385
Filing a case against the management
would lead to big scene..

387
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:38,120
-Tell him..-That will become another issue...

388
00:22:38,323 --> 00:22:39,722
Yes.. another issue..

389
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:43,056
We have eaten the food prepared
by that girl's mother..

390
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,788
lf we cannot do so much for them
then what is the meaning of our existence..

391
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,025
Who is that...

392
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,128
Who is it...

393
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,097
-ls it Babu?-Yes...

394
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:53,737
Come..

395
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:56,274
Ah Ha.

396
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:57,737
This is what is going on..

397
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,099
l will report this..

398
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,816
Babu..you noticed that girl being made to stand

399
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,751
outside the class for not having
paid the exam fee

400
00:23:08,153 --> 00:23:08,448
So..

401
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:10,382
Why didn't you report that?

402
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:11,688
l didn't report...

403
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:16,257
Didn't you see me going to the ATM for
drawing money to pay her exam fees?

404
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:17,086
Yes..

405
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:20,321
-Why didn't you report that?-l didn't report..

406
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:25,702
Didn't you see me wailing on finding her dead ,
Babu?

407
00:23:25,971 --> 00:23:27,029
Yes, l saw..

408
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,263
Why didn't you report that?

409
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,770
l will lose my job, son.

410
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,809
lf you are a man, go and report this

411
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:34,445
Get lost..

412
00:23:35,313 --> 00:23:36,780
Leave...Leeeave..

413
00:23:38,984 --> 00:23:40,781
Babu, don't mention this to anybody.

414
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:41,381
Ok Sir..

415
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:42,442
l will handle this..

416
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,325
Are you going to complain against the
management?

417
00:23:56,501 --> 00:23:57,468
No..

418
00:23:58,336 --> 00:23:59,303
Then what is this?

419
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,199
This one?

420
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:05,935
lt is against those who drove
a poor girl to suicide.

421
00:24:06,344 --> 00:24:07,936
Do you have any issue with it Sir?

422
00:24:08,346 --> 00:24:10,473
This Sir and your mother work in that college..

423
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:15,946
Son, some girl did something foolhardy.
Why do you want it take it on your head?

424
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:18,288
There are other systems to take care of that..

425
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,821
Police and court.. etc..

426
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,527
l am the only one who can tell the truth to
them..

427
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:28,422
Mom, just 10 minutes before she
jumped l had spoken to her..

428
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,334
l had been gone to withdraw money for her
fees..

429
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,404
These are known only to me

430
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,136
So you intend to walk in and out
of police station and courts..

431
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,935
And spoil your life..

432
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,544
lsn't this time for you to study
and reach a good position?

433
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,383
lf l cannot able to react for such incidents,
what is point of education!

434
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,147
You need not go to college...

435
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,515
Be at home for a few days..

436
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,189
None of this is the complaint now..

437
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:55,359
He has been drinking in the campus...

438
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,492
That is what l got a call now..

439
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:01,826
Here, first write an apology to the Principal..

440
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,156
For drinking in the college..

441
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,460
After that we will deal with everything else..

442
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,361
Oh.. l do not know to write an apology..

443
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:08,766
lf need be l can touch your feet..

444
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,036
Not me...You sign on this..

445
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,541
This is for yourfriends too..

446
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,143
Then let me put two signatures..

447
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,220
-Who is this?-My father..

448
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:24,878
Joesph..

449
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,357
What about others?

450
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,119
Since you called for immediately,
my dad could not come.

451
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:32,361
Didn't you have a local guardian?

452
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,399
During the day he may be lying drunk
somewhere.

453
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,568
-What about at night?-ln the night he sleeps.

454
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:42,064
This is Gautham's complaint.... against you.

455
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:43,231
Gautham's!!!

456
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:46,501
You all forced him to drink alcohol in the
college..

457
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,377
We have not done anything of that sort, Sir.

458
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,140
Sir, they are kids..

459
00:25:50,315 --> 00:25:50,804
So..

460
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:52,413
Should we tolerate all their nonsense?

461
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:56,112
When your children gain adulthood,
then they need to be respected as adults..

462
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:56,946
You do that..

463
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:58,052
No Mr. Joseph...

464
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:01,191
These three have already created
enough and more problems..

465
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,294
-Honestly Sir, we did not..
-This is a fake complaint..

466
00:26:04,496 --> 00:26:05,827
Gautham will not complain against us..

467
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:07,359
Then whose signatures are these..

468
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:08,156
Take a look..

469
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,595
Sir, there is something fishy in this..
lt is not him..

470
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,605
There is nothing fishy.Yesterday he cried a lot...

471
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:18,471
Sorry, we have decided to expel you..

472
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:19,944
Sir Please Sir..

473
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,438
You can collect your TCs (Transfer Certificates)
from the office and leave

474
00:26:22,681 --> 00:26:23,943
Sir, what will happen to ourfuture..

475
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:25,581
-Sir, last warning...-All the best for your future..

476
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,318
To hell with you..

477
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:32,616
lf the teachers are of this kind,
then the students life is gone case..

478
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:35,425
Sir, l have a workshop that feeds me..

479
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:36,559
That is enough for him too..

480
00:26:40,332 --> 00:26:42,562
Just relax Sir. Otherwise you could burst..

481
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:44,097
Come lets go son..

482
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,101
Just because they insisted l came..

483
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,240
Do you have anything to say?
lf you have, be quick, l do not have much time..

484
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,205
Jyothi, l haven't done anything..

485
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,481
lt is true that l signed on the blank sheets.
My dad wrote all that..

486
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,980
What difference does it make?Our fate is done..

487
00:27:00,218 --> 00:27:01,150
You must be happy..

488
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:04,178
We were expelled so that you be good..

489
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:06,084
Go and be good...why come to see us..

490
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,416
Go and be good..

491
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,957
You still have not understood me..

492
00:27:09,194 --> 00:27:10,161
Will l do anything against you?

493
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,156
ls there any secret about me
that that you do not know?

494
00:27:13,365 --> 00:27:14,957
lsn't there no secret that we do not know?

495
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,330
-No...-No?

496
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:18,663
Then what about the love affair you had?
ls that something you told us?

497
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,233
ls that something we know?

498
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,339
Which is that love affair?

499
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:24,338
Go....

500
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,169
Why fight with me??

501
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,979
Leave

502
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,676
You don't touch me.. Who are you?

503
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,651
ln my life l'll never have a friend..Got that?

504
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,509
Did you understand?

505
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:38,147
You keep quiet

506
00:27:39,357 --> 00:27:40,619
Subhan...

507
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:41,453
Rexxy....

508
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:42,182
Wait Subaan

509
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:42,723
Leave me...

510
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:44,320
-Wait.. What is this?
Leave me..

511
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:48,961
-Jyothi.. l..-You get lost. Stay away..

512
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,644
Brother.. What will be its Mhp?

513
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,379
Man it is not Mhp.. it is Bhp..

514
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,521
So how much will be its Bhp?

515
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:12,951
Take your hands off..

516
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,452
lt will be around Rs.50 K..

517
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,353
lf you could try around Rs.30-Rs.35

518
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:18,655
What..Leave...

519
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:19,528
Not possible..

520
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,158
Do l make planes..

521
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,355
When you return bring money too

522
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,395
How about fixing a GPS to this?

523
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:28,971
Let me fix a toilet for you!

524
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:34,569
Eh.. Why is he here?

525
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:37,381
Why are you here, Sir?

526
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,144
l was just passing by, and stepped in

527
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,380
Thought of taking a look of Rexxi Enterprises..

528
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,418
Uncle.. Uncle..

529
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,092
This Three X minus X multiplied by 2..

530
00:28:50,295 --> 00:28:51,319
Would you teach me this?

531
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,588
Did you note where the mistake took place?

532
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,326
When solving a linear equation,
before you do addition and substraction,

533
00:28:57,535 --> 00:29:00,163
You need to complete multiplication and
division..

534
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,170
Haven't you learnt the BODMAS rule?

535
00:29:02,373 --> 00:29:05,536
- Oh...-That is the one!!

536
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:09,604
Sorry Rexxi...

537
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,306
lf l had not expelled you from college,
where would you have reached!

538
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:15,315
Why, Sir, do you say sorry?

539
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,512
Only because you expelled me, l joined
with my dad and see the business has doubled

540
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:19,519
Now it going great..

541
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,450
-Do you know...-Hey come here..

542
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,796
Do you know them?
They passed out of your college.

543
00:29:26,197 --> 00:29:26,788
Guys Greet Sir..

544
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,790
-Good morning Sir..-Good morning

545
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:30,698
You get a cup of tea for Sir..

546
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,328
You go and clean up the office..

547
00:29:32,537 --> 00:29:34,630
You sit there..Sorry sir..

548
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:35,797
Sir, please be seated..

549
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,707
You all do not come over these days..

550
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,677
Why do we come Sir?

551
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:44,078
He doesn't even speak to us..

552
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,612
Sir, if you wouldn't mind, may l say something
openly?

553
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:49,080
He needs to be shown to a good psychiatrist.

554
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,222
Yes.. We did ..

555
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,452
lnitially there was good improvement.

556
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,257
He liked the doctor too..

557
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,387
But now that doctor has been dismissed
from that hospital.

558
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,656
He is not inclined to meet any other doctor..

559
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,701
-The sound is really loud...-Go and come in the
evening..

560
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:09,163
-We will take the silencer off..-OK...That's
rocking

561
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,469
Such madness helps us survive..

562
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:22,376
Rexxie.. When l think of Gautham, l am scared..

563
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:26,383
He could do something drastic..is what l..

564
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:29,818
lf you could all come... Maybe he could
change..

565
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,830
Our coming, wouldn't it be a botherfor madam
too?

566
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,462
Hey..Hey.. Wife would be so very pleased...

567
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,672
Good morning madam..

568
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:47,607
Hmm..

569
00:30:48,246 --> 00:30:50,146
When we came the door was ajar..

570
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,573
Really hungry too..

571
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:53,111
Food was also there..

572
00:30:54,886 --> 00:30:56,353
Madam, would you have yesterday's fish curry?

573
00:30:57,889 --> 00:30:58,856

574
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:00,721
-At least the gravy could be...-No.. it is not..

575
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,558
Hey Sir..Good morning Sir.

576
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:05,353
Good morning..

577
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,456
You had asked us to consider it as our own
house..

578
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,493
Definitely consider it as your own house..

579
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,302
But there has to be a limit..

580
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,365
Sorry madam.Did not know the limit of idly..

581
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:17,506

582
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,243
Sir, Didn't see Gautam..

583
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,211
He will not be in the kitchen.
He is in the upstairs..

584
00:31:23,414 --> 00:31:24,381
Oh he is in his room..

585
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,850
-Hey.. Wash your hands..-Eh..

586
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:26,512
Wash your hands and go..

587
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,683
Wash your hands for me..

588
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,560

You wouldn't mind?

589
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:40,565
Hey.. Not at all...

And even have him take a little.
Only then would he be free..

592
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,372
Then don't wait..
Sir, would you buy us a bottle?

593
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,504

Then shall we take leave..

599
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,643
Buy it forthem..

600
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:00,944
Now that thing is OK..

601
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:01,647
Come, come..

00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,551

00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:19,567
Oh you still watch blue films.

610
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:20,303

00:32:27,011 --> 00:32:28,842

615
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,678
Why did you come?

00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:31,845
Shall we have a bath?

617
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:33,680

00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,356
Hmm..

00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:41,017
So then let us bathe.

-You go first..-l will go first..

626
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,312
What is this dirty show?

627
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,277
Body.. Sexy Body..

628
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,383
Seeing my body you do not feel anything..

629
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:08,476
What to feel?

630
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:09,545
What about mine?

631
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,412
Feel like vomiting..Get dressed..man

632
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,987
You do feel anything on seeing my body..

633
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,858
No, Nothing..

634
00:33:15,093 --> 00:33:15,422
Really..

635
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,854
Are you sure?

636
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:17,527
Yeah..

637
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,930
He is not a gay..Confirmed..

638
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,869
Sir. Omelet and make some chicken too..

639
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:31,041
You take this...

640
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:34,502
You hold this..

641
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:38,013
ls he using the straw to drink?

642
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:41,509
How long it has been since
we got together like this!

643
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:42,845
Before we begin..

644
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:44,384
-Toast Eh?-No..

645
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,420
Please give your phone.

646
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,086
Do not please us like this?

647
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:51,691
Hey what are you doing?

648
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:53,862
This phone costs Rs.20000..

649
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:56,396
So your life is not worth even Rs.20000

650
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:56,999
What....

651
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,403
What is more dangerous than this phone
being put into this ..

652
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:01,401
ls this going into your body..

653
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,306
Just to tell this you took this roundabout
route?

654
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,008
No point in telling you this.

655
00:34:06,611 --> 00:34:07,578
l will show you something..

656
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:09,880
Good .. show us. Some movies..

657
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:25,852
The first symptoms show up in the family life..

658
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,690
As it starts impacting married life,
one gets labeled impotent by the partner..

659
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:31,061
Mr. Jyotish, did you understand this?

660
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,993
Understood in bits and pieces..

661
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,539
lt will harm your fertility

662
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:36,637
What...

663
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,600
Oh ho..

664
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,448
What did the doctor say?

665
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,406
There is no problem with me..

666
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,077
Then who has the problem?

667
00:34:56,894 --> 00:34:57,121
Ohh HHo..

668
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,400
What happened? Did he drink?

669
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:11,974
He did not but l stopped drinking..

670
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:13,100
Hold this..

671
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,410
Sir, do you know one thing?

672
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:18,711
Drinking is harmful for health.

673
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,775
For many body parts..

674
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:22,985
Never buy alcohol for children!

675
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:29,087
Jupiter is completely inhospitable
to life as we understand.

676
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:33,396
But its moon Europa has been proposed
as a possible habitable zone.

677
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:35,456
-lt is thought to have a large...
-Dude.. Just a minute..

678
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,460
Bro.. he is still studying..

679
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:40,534
About Jupiter and Mars..

680
00:35:40,771 --> 00:35:42,102
Do tell him about all that..

681
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,868
So far everything was fine.. Till..

682
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,510
To take Gautham outdoors these two
scoundrels...

683
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,203
Do you recall Subhan?

684
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,741
-Subhan Abdul Qadir!-Yes..

685
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:54,983
He has blood cancer..

686
00:35:57,088 --> 00:35:57,713
Oh.. God..

687
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,521
His expressed poignantly his last
wish was to meet you..

688
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,058
How..

689
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:04,455
Emotionally said..

690
00:36:05,129 --> 00:36:06,528
How about going there?

691
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:10,157
He has to give me Rs1000 that were
taken as hand loan earlier

692
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:11,160
That l'll ask

693
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:12,699
What did you say?

694
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:16,540
lf we get him, great or else gone..

695
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:18,766
People say, that we will not get..

696
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:22,137
We shall see..

697
00:36:22,914 --> 00:36:24,176
lsn't that his last wish?

698
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:26,481
Aren't you coming?

699
00:36:26,918 --> 00:36:27,885
You must come.

700
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:28,881
He will..

701
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:29,586
He will..

702
00:36:33,925 --> 00:36:36,052
Why is it so heavy?

703
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,454
Are you stopping over in planet Mars, on the
way?

704
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,219
You can go to Mars. But cannot come back..

705
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,660
What kind of a place is that..you cannot return..

706
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,734
ln that case l could send my wife and
father-in-law on a tourthere.

707
00:36:45,503 --> 00:36:46,197
Rs.77.00

708
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:48,902
One of my friend is critical.

709
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:50,908
l am going to meet him

710
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:52,768
l am going with them.

711
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,543
l will not be getting into any troubles..

712
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,042
You need not be tensed about that..

713
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:58,070
So far so good..

714
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:01,575
Now even if you create some problems, No
problem..

715
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,754
No... Never..

716
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,885
We are already 3 minutes late..

717
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:09,092
Lets go..

718
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:12,293
-All the best.. -For us..

719
00:37:15,299 --> 00:37:18,564
Subhan Allah.. Subhan Allah..

720
00:37:18,936 --> 00:37:20,164
Subhan Allah..

721
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,600
Mr. Rexxie, Mr. Jyothis Narayan..

00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,772
We are going to see a dying patient..

723
00:37:26,143 --> 00:37:27,132
Such excitement does not suit..

724
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:28,770
How sad??

725
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:30,137
Has dialysis started?

726
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:32,015
No. He said he doesn't like that.

727
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:32,806
Eh..

728
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,014
He doesn't like it..

729
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:37,083
What nonsense! Dialysis is the only solution.

730
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:38,785
Oh..Oh my god..

731
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:40,289
Page 208..

732
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:41,123
What is it?

733
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:42,883
All details about cancer is there..

734
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,253
Are we going for an education tour?

735
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,892
lf so, stop at thatjunction..

736
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,528
Buy a 200 page note book and some pens..

737

00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:55,661
ldiot! at least could you stop?

740
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:58,138
Would you pull over?

741
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,900
Pulling is low. Got to get it repaired..

742
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,303
No.. Stop on the side...

743
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:02,110
Oh That!

744
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:04,676
Where are you going?

745
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:10,147
He has taken the water too.

746
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:14,783
He has gone to pee...

747
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,888
The new word for peeing is pull over..

748
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,891
This is the first time l am seeing someone
who is peeing to drink water..

749
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,895
What kind of a person is this?
What is his illness?

750
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:26,602
Shall we go?

751
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,736
lt is an old vehicle! Don't spoil it..

752
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,807
What would it be like with that mad Subhan!

753
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:18,353
Cock

754
00:39:19,056 --> 00:39:20,683
Cock is your dad, Joseph..

755
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:22,625
l am now a football coach..

756
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,189
Oh l thought it was hockey..

757
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,323
Dude, Why is it the hair on
your head is like this?

758
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,626
Haven't you seen Virat Kohli?

759
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,424
Now have seen Virat turning into a dummy..

760
00:39:36,941 --> 00:39:37,908
You don't laugh..

761
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:40,137
Laugh man..

762
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,105
Why is like this so serious!

763
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,711
What happened to him?

764
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,747
Dude, What happened to him?

765
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,119
What is it?

766
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,253
-You are good?-Yeah..

767
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:55,425
How about going home?

768
00:39:56,961 --> 00:39:57,928
-Biriyani..-Aah..

769
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,064
-This is his grandpa - Salam alaikum!

770
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,397
That is his grandma

771
00:40:08,939 --> 00:40:10,907
-That's his uncle.. - Excuse me.

772
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:12,206
Who are you?

773
00:40:12,443 --> 00:40:14,411
-l am his dad! - Oh!

774
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:18,081
Blood Cancer!

775
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,712
Hearing that, my limbs are shivering!

776
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,053
Didn't you get any other disease to tell him.

777
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,120
lf l had said piles, would he come to see that?

778
00:40:25,322 --> 00:40:27,187
Phew! l'm a Sportsman you know?

779
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:32,188
Weren't you saying that you
had a secret love affair?.

780
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,731
Who was that girl?

781
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,067
Christy..

782
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,062
-That rowdy girl? - Hmm!

783
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,897
You missed hertoo!!

784
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,405
Hey Christy! How are you?

785
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,205
-Saw Gautham? - No.

786
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,413
You sit! l am very bored!

787
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:52,708
l'm quitting College, dude!

788
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:53,713
Why? What happened?

789
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,183
One of my love letters reached Principal's
hands!

790
00:40:59,089 --> 00:41:00,056
Wrote a love letter?.

791
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:01,721
To whom?

792
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:19,204
What?

793
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,081
Wasn't he hanging around with me all the time?

794
00:41:24,081 --> 00:41:26,049
Didn't he have all the freedom to say anything?

795
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,885
Considering his reluctance to confess,

796
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,884
l took the initiative and wrote that letter.

797
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,565
Got anything in your mind, please say.

798
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:44,901
Whatever l wished to say..is written on this.

799
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,905
l don't know how that letter reached Principal's
hands!

800
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,404
Hmm..l will surely report this.

801
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,907
Subhu, please have Gautam call me.

802
00:41:55,379 --> 00:41:56,209
My phone number is..

803
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:56,913
l have it.

804
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:02,544
So... the separation from her caused
that deep impact on his mind

805
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,218
Bringing her back may cure him, l feel!

806
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,049
Must find her somehow.

807
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,326
ln case if she is married..

808
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,322
She lives in Kochi near bridge

809
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:13,893
Taking care of her father's business, She is
single.

810
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,065
How do you know?

811
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,234
l'm unlike you. l follow my friends.

812
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:18,560
But you didn't follow us?

813
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,335
Aleast need a minimum class to follow.

814
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,401
You don't have one, that's why.

815
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,576
Where did he get this china net from, dude?

816
00:42:26,944 --> 00:42:29,412
-He has many similar things in his luggage -
Really?

817
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:31,141
Probably there is gas stove also.

818
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,212
He started.

819
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,317
Look at the way he is lying.
Only cotton needs to be stuffed in his nostrils

820
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,143
Leave him. Why are you still unmarried?

821
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:38,480
Why should l?

822
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:39,923
Should we tell you for what?

823
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:43,218
Can l hang around freely like this if married?

824
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:47,222
Can we do or go anywhere as we please! No
one will ask.

825
00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:50,433
Your father was saying he looked at around 150
matches, What was that for?

826
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:52,595
With everyone's permission,

827
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:59,102
the chance of talking freely to a girl..
Would anyone let go that?

828
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,078
l say this not because he is my son.

829
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:03,470
He is an idiot!

830
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,416
Very childish!

831
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:08,079
Father..

832
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,216
-He wishes to talk to the girl! - Certainly!

833
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:18,588
This ritual is mainly forthe boy and girl
to speak with, know and understand each other

834
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:21,227
-You go and.. -Already left!

835
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,090
Oh!

836
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,229
-Hey, you got lovely dimples! - Thanks!

837
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:25,931

839
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,230
Do you go to the Gym?

840
00:43:29,473 --> 00:43:31,236
No...Never.

841
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:34,110
But you have a good figure! Looks stunning!

842
00:43:34,478 --> 00:43:36,605
-What if l take a Selfie?- Yes, of course.

843
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:38,448
Thank God! Nobody is watching us.

844
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:47,321
You still the..

845
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,593
l have the numbers of all the girls l saw.

846
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,427
l do still contact them often.

847
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,096
You flirt!

848
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:54,230
Need luck!

849
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,596
Needn't worry! He is going for a pee!

850
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,599
-He pees too often. - Really?

851
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,212
Looks like there is some function at house!

852
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,918
ls it herfather's death ceremony or?.

853
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:17,420
Hmm..no..

854
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:18,421
Hello!

855
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,083
Ok, l will call you later.

856
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:23,593
-Hi Christy! - Hi!

857
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,358
-Hey...- Role models!

858
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,427
-Yes..Yes.. - Come..Come...

859
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,602
My marriage is fixed.

860
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:36,940
Next week is my engagement

861
00:44:37,141 --> 00:44:39,609
and is it now you guys are turning up
with this old love story?

862
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:41,410
Shall l ask you something?

863
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,404
Yourfirst love was Gautham, right?

864
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:46,343
-True? - Ok.

865
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:47,743
lf you ask me like that...

866
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:50,746
Even with my fiance, l do not think that way.

867
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:56,753
Atleast, seldom, l used to think of Gautham!

868
00:44:57,127 --> 00:44:58,594
This is what l said.

869
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:00,760
But my marriage is already fixed.

870
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:04,094
Whatever it be! Gautham is behind you.

871
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:09,235
Rather than going for an affair after marriage,
ain't it betterto move on with the affair now..

872
00:45:11,275 --> 00:45:12,765
There is sense in what you speak still..

873
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:15,236
Already a person is waiting for me!

874
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:16,241
Since how long?

875
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,378
Nearly 5 - 6 months!

876
00:45:17,648 --> 00:45:19,775
Silly girl! He is been waiting for 8 years!

877
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:24,411
You know, like Shobhana's wait in the movie
''Journey'' he is also waiting for you there.

878
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,085
With lighted lamps?

879
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,190
No lamps, he has turned on the lights!

880
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:29,256
Yes..LED!

881
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,087
House looks like a Stadium now.

882
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:36,597
Moonlight... two love birds together

883
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,759

884
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:45,268

Awful!

892
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:06,125
l had a love affair during my college days.

893
00:46:07,164 --> 00:46:08,791
lt wasn't that serious at that time

894
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,626
But now he is very serious!

895
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:13,803
Oh no! Not in the hospital.

896
00:46:14,505 --> 00:46:16,370
-He is waiting for me. - Hospital!!

897
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:17,799
Right now he is here.

00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:20,772
l wish to see him.

899
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:25,778
After seeing him, in case if

Certainly not!

902
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:33,453

903
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:37,624
After knowing a person is waiting
for me for 8 years,

904
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:39,523

00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:02,448
What do you mean by Policy?

913
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,782

and shaking top down in jingles ..

Are you any bus ortrain to be waiting for?

Until l have a baby!

950
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,467
Then l will show my true colours

952
00:49:13,684 --> 00:49:14,275

Phone..Phone is ringing

959
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,473
You are wicked.. really wicked!

960
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,651
l thought you really loved me.
l said something in fun.

961
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,980
l thought that if l say that
you would keep calling me.

962
00:49:52,689 --> 00:49:55,283
Do you know how long l've
been waiting for your call?

963
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:56,818
But you didn't call me back.

964
00:49:57,861 --> 00:49:59,294
You needn't say anything..

965
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,657
Bye..Good bye..

966
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,832
She is not like what we imagined.

967
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,497
See it is ringing again.

968
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:13,841
No, l don't wish to hear anything

969
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:16,002
Do you know how l've been
living for these many hours?

970
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,673
l wasn't able to breathe also!

971
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,484
Don't call me anymore.

972
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,816
Pardon.

973
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,822
No, l'm a little busy! l got some work!

974
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,826

00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:32,829

976
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:38,298
Ok. Let me try.

Sure! - Ok.

980
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,411
Are you saying you never loved Christy?

981
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,477
No! l don't have any relationship with her

982
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:55,484
So was it the Librarian you
fell in love with in the Library?

983
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,112
Wasn't it you who always said, there
shouldn't be any secrets between friends?

984
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:01,821
And you, concealed your love affair from us!

985
00:51:03,026 --> 00:51:06,826
lt's all past, isn't it?
lf you are not interested to sat,then don't! Move!

986
00:51:14,871 --> 00:51:15,838
Come on, speak.

987
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:18,007
Speak..

988
00:51:19,709 --> 00:51:22,644
lt's for her sake that l concealed
it from you guys also.

989
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,807
So that no problems arises for herfuture!

990
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:27,644
Doesn't this ''HER'' has a name?

991
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:32,818
SHREYA

992
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:51,606
lf her parents had any inkling,
she would be out of the college that moment..

993
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,001
That is why l kept it so confidential.

994
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:03,815
But without any of you noticing,
she was always with us. Always

995
00:52:11,862 --> 00:52:12,988
Gautham, come here.

996
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:19,092
Where the hell were you?

997
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:22,996
See this! l won the prize in 100mts and 400mts
sprints.

998
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:26,437
But neither you nor anybody else was
there to applaud and cheer!

999
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:28,177
Keep having cheap fun there!

1000
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,137
-You know something? - What?

1001
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,139
- Life never happens again! - What?

1002
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:35,017
-Look at the fatso chasing me! - Hey stop...

1003
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:36,146
-Meals? - Yes!

1004
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,856
Thank you! Had l known this,
l would've rescued her daily

1005
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,526
So it was a strong love! Drink!

1006
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,034
-Excuse me! Let me pee! - Please do.

1007
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:57,597
Where is Shreya now?

1008
00:52:58,475 --> 00:52:59,533
She is in Goa now.

1009
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,239
She is not the old Shreya anymore.
l always check her facebook page.

1010
00:53:03,713 --> 00:53:06,011
Whether old or new, isn't she the same Shreya?

1011
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:07,676
Let us go there.

1012
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:10,148
Adventurous sports are her profession now.

1013
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:13,580
lf we take boys like him who
have taken a hit on their head

1014
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,084
We can't even step up to her

1015
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,157
Goa trip, isn't it? We will get it done.

1016
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:23,593
Gautham, before he dies,
he has one more last wish!

1017
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:24,690
What the hell!

1018
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,163
He wishes to visit Goa!

1019
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,868
How many last wishes do you have?

1020
00:53:29,072 --> 00:53:30,869
Around 5 - 8!

1021
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:35,707
There is nothing wrong with you! Eh Cancer!!

1022
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,046
What is in Goa?

1023
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:41,239
ln Goa, there is beach, White women, then etc..

1024
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:42,844
White Women are also seen in Fort Kochi now.

1025
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,146
But to see Bikini wearing White women,
we must go to Goa!

1026
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,854
Show him her profile on your phone!

1027
00:54:02,205 --> 00:54:02,864
Will it work?

1028
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,006
She is still single! And Still waiting!

1029
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,850
May be for you, still waiting.

1030
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,012
Shall we go?

1031
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:50,615
No.

1032
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,354
Then , we shall take bath and start. Ok.

1033
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:21,277
Shreya...Fantasticjob! Continue.

1034
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,686
Tell me before gardener returns.
What do you say?

1035
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:27,186
Haven't we watched Avatar 2 -3 times,
then why watching it again?

1036
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:29,858
As we wear 3 D glasses,
nobody around will notice us.

1037
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:31,027
Will get privacy!

1038
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,206
Eh! What happened?

1039
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:48,703
Why you stopped?

1040
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,709
For what else! To pee!

1041
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:53,382
His Urine tank seems to be bigger
than the petrol tank of this vehicle!

1042
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,383
-He is coming! Hide his bottle! - Ok.

1043
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,289
-Shall we move? - Hmm.

1044
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:03,055
-Hey, where is my bottle?
- Thief has stolen it.

1045
00:56:03,326 --> 00:56:04,884
Now he will not pee till Goa!

1046
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:35,052
Hello Shreya!

1047
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:39,193
People generally fix only Cameras in the
drones

1048
00:56:39,429 --> 00:56:41,897
But l also added a Pico projector to it.

1049
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:46,065
For you to see me talking from
there and see you from here!

1050
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,730
l wanted to tell you face-to-face.

1051
00:56:48,938 --> 00:56:51,736
Then l thought of telling you
through this new project of mine.

1052
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:55,737
Nothing great...Just that little love thing!

1053
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,740
Oh oh! Reasons for falling in love?

1054
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,043
You are a good runner.

1055
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,886
But not an athlete!

1056
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:08,054
You study well but not a book worm!

1057
00:57:08,324 --> 00:57:09,882
You look good,

1058
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:11,884
that doesn't mean you are very beautiful

1059
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,055
That's the reason!

1060
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:15,397
So?

1061
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:16,895
l love you.

1062
00:57:38,087 --> 00:57:40,146
''Every morning l'm broken,

1063
00:57:40,356 --> 00:57:42,051
Every day l die''

1064
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,886
''Every night l weaken,

1065
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:46,721
And every night l cry''

1066
00:57:53,436 --> 00:57:55,734
Madam, give some alms please!

1067
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:57,736
O God! Upon seeing a beggar, l woke up.

1068
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,068
Please give some alms, bro!

1069
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,380
You fool!

1070
00:58:17,093 --> 00:58:18,185
Rocking ah!

1071
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:25,898
You rascal!

1072
00:58:27,437 --> 00:58:29,200
Hitting him for not giving alms!

1073
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:32,199
O God! He is walking towards us!

1074
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,910
Don't give any alms, ok.

1075
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:36,908

01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,839
''You cheated me, girl.''

1251
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:11,803
''You cheated me, girl.''

1252
01:09:12,748 --> 01:09:16,809
''l became stiff like an ironed shirt''

1253
01:09:17,686 --> 01:09:20,814
''And reduced to a beggar''

1254
01:09:30,199 --> 01:09:31,666
-Hello Shreya! - Hi!

1255
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:32,993

1256
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:37,730
Good! Well..l thought of asking you guys
something at the Beach.

1257
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,166

1258
01:09:39,575 --> 01:09:41,668
lnfact at the beach, l also told you l got

1259
01:09:41,877 --> 01:09:43,003

1260
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:43,678
Hmm..

1261
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:46,848
That was also ajoke.

1262
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:49,013
-What? - l really had something to say..

1263
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,710
-Didn't l say now l really got

1264
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:53,511
That was also ajoke.

1265
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:54,982
You carry on going.

1266
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:56,650
Carry on, my friend.

1267
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:59,161
Hey, has he gone nuts?

1268
01:10:00,563 --> 01:10:02,656
Well, l forgot to ask you something.

1269
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:03,661
Where do you stay now?

1270
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,663
We're yet to book the room.

1271
01:10:06,035 --> 01:10:07,525
lf that is the case, l will give you a card.

1272
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,171
We're running a home stay.
You can stay there if you need to...

1273
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:13,667
At my home itself.

1274
01:10:13,776 --> 01:10:14,936
Lucy Homestay!

1275
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:20,515
On a yellow branch, a yellow house..

1276
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,508
Hey, welcome Role models!

1277
01:10:24,787 --> 01:10:25,651
There is a Hen on top!

1278
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:28,516
-Come on. - Your nickname only!

1279
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:30,753
Hey Shreya, we shall chat after dinner, come.

1280
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:32,926
Dinner..Dinner..Dinnertime.

1281
01:10:37,866 --> 01:10:38,662
Sorry about the song.

1282
01:10:39,868 --> 01:10:40,664
That was fun.

1283
01:10:42,037 --> 01:10:43,163
Dude! She patted him.

1284
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:45,665
Who else stays here, Shreya?

1285
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,771
Here there is my Uncle, aunty and myself.

1286
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:50,136
How old is your aunt?

1287
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:53,140
Dog's tail and your brain...
will never be straightened up!

1288
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,517
ln Dog's case, there are still chances!

1289
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,648
This and that are your rooms.

1290
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:01,652
lt's not Shashti Poorthi but
Sapramanja(Wooden Canopy) bed!

1291
01:11:01,857 --> 01:11:02,152
l know.

1292
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:03,991
O God! What a creature are you!

1293
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:09,660
Dude! Watch this!

1294
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:11,833
Wasn't him whom we met this morning at the
beach?

1295
01:11:16,872 --> 01:11:18,601
l never expected l would get back my vehicle.

1296
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:20,667
Hmm..Exactly! He is the one.

1297
01:11:21,043 --> 01:11:22,010
What does he say?

1298
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,679
lt seems Singh's bike was stolen.

1299
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,179
When telecasted it in their hot news
channel, he recovered it.

1300
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,011
Oh, this is his regular business, is it?

1301
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:33,348
ls he the Mammotty in the New Delhi film
to create news

1302
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:35,983
Dining hall is on the other side.

1303
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,590
Freshen up and have food.

1304
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:38,657
ls freshening up necessary?

1305
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:39,759
Hello! Come on.

1306
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,361
Wow! Apple and Orange!

1307
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:46,165
-Wow! Kerala Parotta and Chicken roast!- Oh!

1308
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:49,667
-Beef curry and many eggs! - Wow!

1309
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:52,999
Chicken will be yummy!

1310
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:54,004
Are you not eating?

1311
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:57,007
Looks like antibiotics injected Chicken!

1312
01:11:57,212 --> 01:11:58,372
Really? And what for?

1313
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,009
Antibiotics are used to raise Chickens!

1314
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:04,344
And when you fall sick,
Antibiotics may not respond in your body.

1315
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:05,683
Oh!

1316
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:07,689
-You eat this, buddy. - Eh!

1317
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:09,857
What? Biotic!!

1318
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,190
Parottica!!

1319
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:14,021
-Parotta is actually very tasty.- l know.

1320
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:17,687
But it will block your stomach
and affect Pancreas!

1321
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,868
There are chances of becoming
a lifetime Sugar Patient.

1322
01:12:20,235 --> 01:12:20,599
Thank you.

1323
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:23,203
Then, have fruits! No harm!

1324
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:24,702
Fruits are always good!

1325
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:26,204
Skin will glow and shine like this.

1326
01:12:26,408 --> 01:12:27,375
Show, let me see.

1327
01:12:27,743 --> 01:12:28,767
No harm if it's a good fruit.

1328
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:31,171
But, there is some wax coating on this!

1329
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:33,176
lf you eat this, you could get Cancer!

1330
01:12:37,219 --> 01:12:38,420
Can l atleast drink some water?.

1331
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,014
l don't take a chance. l only drink mineral water.

1332
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,384
lf observe it well, you will surely find some
germs.

1333
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:44,688
ln this?

1334
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:47,862
And this Orange..

1335
01:12:50,432 --> 01:12:52,764
Very good one! Can make it out
from its colour, it's organic.

1336
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:53,864
Pure and totally local

1337
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:55,394
Oh no!

1338
01:12:57,239 --> 01:12:58,206
Hello Sis!

1339
01:12:58,907 --> 01:12:59,874

1340
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:02,877
Yes dear!

1341
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:05,873
Nothing, you eat.

1342
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:08,375
Pure and local!! Good for health!

1343
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:11,417
And eggs?

1344
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:12,754
Cholesterol content is..

1345
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:13,384
l will put it aside!

1346
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:18,382
Drink!

1347
01:13:19,061 --> 01:13:20,187
l don't drink tea.

1348
01:13:20,429 --> 01:13:22,021
lt's your favourite coffee.

1349
01:13:34,076 --> 01:13:34,701
Thank you.

1350
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,705
Let me take Uncle's permission and come.

1351
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,188
My subconscious mind..

1352
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:53,020
You are the creator of my body.

1353
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,696
You can remove my pot belly

1354
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:56,856
Hello!

1355
01:13:57,232 --> 01:14:00,395
Haven't you stopped self hypnotizing?

1356
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:02,861
What am l to do if there are no patients?

1357
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,202
Well, l brought 3-4 persons here.

1358
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:07,204
Patients? 4 Patients?

No, they are from Kerala. Had come to stay
here.

1360
01:14:10,078 --> 01:14:12,376
Don't you know only foreigners are allowed to
stay here?

1361
01:14:12,548 --> 01:14:15,847
Uncle, they are my friends! However it's off

1362
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:20,016
Ok. On a safer side, Collect amount in advance.

Ok

1365
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:27,028
By the way, Uncle, aunty was looking for

O Bharat Mata!

1368
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,038
Don't touch.

1369
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:38,531
Has Bharat Mata arrived?

1370
01:14:39,074 --> 01:14:40,803

-Hey aunty! - Who do you think l am?

1378

Honey!

1383
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:07,793
Honey, come.

You should take medicines nah, honey!

What is this?

1389
01:15:16,078 --> 01:15:17,545
Uncle's wife! Lucy aunty!

1390
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:19,039
a bit loose too?

1391
01:15:19,581 --> 01:15:20,445
lt was a love marriage.

1392
01:15:20,816 --> 01:15:21,783
She was Uncle's patient.

1393
01:15:22,084 --> 01:15:23,381
O mental love!

1394
01:15:23,919 --> 01:15:24,214

01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:31,453
Please take it, honey.

1398

Take some water.

Good boy!

What if we run?

1409
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:08,426
-Honey! - Run..Run.

1410
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:11,627
Whatever be the medicines for Aunty, she will
take it only after she has Uncle taken it.

1411
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:12,566
Why?

1412
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:16,434
Aunty is afraid whether Uncle
is trying to kill her.

1413
01:16:17,472 --> 01:16:19,235
Would she give us in absence of Uncle?

1414
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:20,403
Hmm! Probably!

1415
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,278
Nothing will happen to you.
lt's just the Medicine for mental problems!

1416

Oh! So you also took that and recovered, ah!

Stop your consultation over phone!

See me personally and pay the fees!

1420
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:35,048
-Doctor! - O God! Who is that?

1421
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,418
l don't believe this.
Where were you, doctor?

1422
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,222

1423

No, l meant, where were you all these years?

1424
01:16:41,463 --> 01:16:42,225
Goa!

1425
01:16:42,464 --> 01:16:43,431
Don't you recognize me, doctor?

1426
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:44,623
l was your patient.

1427
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,068
l consulted you thrice at Kochi.

1428
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:51,228
Ah! Oh yes! l never forget my patients.

1429
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,437
Bucker?

1430
01:16:52,674 --> 01:16:53,436
No doctor.

1431
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,440
-Kamalakshan! - No.

1432
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:56,239
Then, who are you?

1433
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,467
Doctor, l'm Gautham

1434
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,647
-O Gautham! - Yes, doctor.

1435
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,480
-How are you, man? - Fine, doctor.

1436
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:03,048
l searched for you everywhere.

1437
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:05,048
That hospital was not willing
to give any details about you.

1438
01:17:05,253 --> 01:17:05,651
Rascals!

1439
01:17:06,088 --> 01:17:07,055
But l finally found you.

1440
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:08,222
That's great!

1441
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,049
l got something to tell you, doctor.

1442
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:11,987
l can't discuss it with anyone else.

1443
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:14,221
l haven't spoken to any one for the last 3
months.

1444
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,655
Gautham...Relax!

1445
01:17:17,099 --> 01:17:18,225
-Yeah! - Relax!

1446
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:19,901
Sit down here.

1447
01:17:21,703 --> 01:17:23,898
-l'll be back now - Sure... doctor.

1448
01:17:24,473 --> 01:17:25,440
This is my hand.

1449
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:28,075
-O sorry. - l will come quickly,

1450
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:29,433
Relax!

1451
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:30,571
No.

1452
01:18:32,274 --> 01:18:33,571
Something in bits and pieces..

1453
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,478
l need not know all that.

1454
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:39,072
l want the complete details right now.

1455
01:18:42,284 --> 01:18:44,252
Just listen to what l say.

1456
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:05,269
Hey, who was that who hit me? Who?

1457
01:19:06,141 --> 01:19:07,608
lf you have the guts, come face to face!

1458
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,581
Who is that? Who?

1459
01:19:16,485 --> 01:19:18,077
Batman... Batman

1460
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:22,749
Compromise! Batman.

1461
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:35,770
O God! l have not done anything against
America

1462
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:39,106
Why did you react like that?

1463
01:19:39,708 --> 01:19:40,766
Wouldn't talking sufficed?

1464
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:43,439
l felt like doing it that way.

1465
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:47,774
Do you walk around like this during nights?

1466
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:49,615
Yes, seldom.

1467
01:19:51,486 --> 01:19:54,580
Tell me the first word that comes to your mind
now.

1468
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:57,082
Murder.

1469
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:10,597
You guys were not aware of his problem?

1470
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:16,543
Anger and revenge that he'd suppressed it for
long still persists on Gautam's mind

1471
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,614
lt may emerge out in any form.

1472
01:20:21,116 --> 01:20:22,083
So be careful, guys!

1473
01:20:39,434 --> 01:20:40,696
Dude! l will pee and be back.

1474
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,097
Pee for me too

1475
01:20:45,273 --> 01:20:45,830
Where is he?

1476
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:14,565

Leave me.

1500
01:26:04,726 --> 01:26:05,693
Hello Police Station.

1501
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:22,838
Catch him.

1502
01:26:42,096 --> 01:26:44,223
Now, is he ANNYAN(Stranger) or
MAYAVl(Magician)?

1503
01:26:44,732 --> 01:26:45,221
Who are they?

1504
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,532
They are characters in the films!

1505
01:26:46,734 --> 01:26:47,701
Annyan does it secretly

1506
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,699
But Mayavi does it openly!

1507
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:50,700
l can't assure that.

1508
01:26:50,905 --> 01:26:52,873
Or any mental disorders?

1509
01:26:53,274 --> 01:26:55,242
That we can't confirm it

1510
01:26:55,743 --> 01:26:56,869
Doctor, you know anything?

1511
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:00,839
ls this doctor a stupid ass?

1512
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:02,514
l'm asking about his condition.

1513
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:03,843
Or Durga Asthami (Ceremonial worship
of Goddess Durga's Weapons?

1514
01:27:04,586 --> 01:27:05,075
What you mean?

1515
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:11,852
''Today is Durga Asthami! l will kill you,
drink your blood and dance on it''... Ganga...

1516
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,093
lt's not a dual personality!

1517
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:17,087
-Your good name! - Rexy!

1518
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:20,868
Relax, Rexy..Sit down.

1519
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:24,697
Look into my eyes.

1520
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:32,068
No need to be tensed. This drug..one daily.

1521
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:34,848
Suppose he refuses to take..

1522
01:27:35,283 --> 01:27:36,682
-lt's not for him. - Then?

1523
01:27:38,620 --> 01:27:39,245
What is wrong with me?

1524
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:41,081
Problem is with you only.

1525
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:45,524
True, doctor! At night, he tosses
and turns in sleep.

1526
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:48,093
And keeps talking in sleep.

1527
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:50,158
-How do you know? - That's..

1528
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,897
So you don't sleep at night.

1529
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:54,101
No doctor.

1530
01:27:55,903 --> 01:27:56,699
Take one daily.

1531
01:27:57,739 --> 01:27:58,865
ls it pulses?

1532
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,573
lt's also similar to that

1533
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:03,269
Your good name?

1534
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:04,769
l sleep at night.

1535
01:28:05,146 --> 01:28:06,841
Sleeping at night, but freaking name!

1536
01:28:07,382 --> 01:28:09,317
No, l mean l sleep soundly at night.

1537
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:10,341
- Sleep soundly? - Yes

1538
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:11,844
Then go and sleep.

1539
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:13,854
Hello!

1540
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:16,246
-We are moving - Let's go dude!

1541
01:28:17,725 --> 01:28:18,692
ls he a quack doctor?

1542
01:28:18,893 --> 01:28:20,861
l too think so ! Because he says you're normal.

1543
01:28:29,137 --> 01:28:31,105
Gautham! lt is been some time
since you wanted to ask me something!

1544
01:28:31,406 --> 01:28:32,873
Haven't questions been framed yet!

1545
01:28:33,408 --> 01:28:35,143
lt has been a long gap,

1546
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:38,112
So l thought there would be many things to
ask.

1547
01:28:38,413 --> 01:28:40,381
Well that..

1548
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:43,373
-The guys hanging around with you on bikes..
- Yes..

1549
01:28:44,118 --> 01:28:45,085
What is it about them?

1550
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:46,853
Actually our biker gang!

1551
01:28:47,121 --> 01:28:49,681
lnitially, we werejust 2-3 of us.

1552
01:28:50,124 --> 01:28:52,684
Later it formed to 7- 8 memberteam! Come.

1553
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:57,387
A group of some insecure people like me!

1554
01:28:58,399 --> 01:28:59,866
Don't l have to survive here, my Gautham?

1555
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:02,096
And not any body guards, right?

1556
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:03,267
Not such.

1557
01:29:04,906 --> 01:29:06,100
Would it move on shore also?

1558
01:29:06,741 --> 01:29:07,366
Got scared?

1559
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:09,107
Yes, a little.

1560
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:09,876
Hey guys!

1561
01:29:11,112 --> 01:29:12,704
-Hey! - Hi!

1562
01:29:13,114 --> 01:29:13,375
Shreya, come on.

1563
01:29:13,748 --> 01:29:15,375
Hey, this is Gautham.

1564
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,717
My classmate!

1565
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:18,886
And Gautham, they are my friends.

1566
01:29:19,287 --> 01:29:20,254
Hello Gautham!

1567
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:32,399
Hey Stanley!

1568
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:34,897
What nonsense are you doing?

1569
01:29:35,303 --> 01:29:36,099
Stop it!

1570
01:29:37,438 --> 01:29:38,268
l'm so sorry, Gautham.

1571
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,270
Don't mistake me, l have to go now.

1572
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:01,388
They are lucky l didn't take my rifle
or l would've fired them.

1573
01:30:01,763 --> 01:30:02,252
What is all this?

1574
01:30:03,898 --> 01:30:04,694
What are you doing?

1575
01:30:05,133 --> 01:30:07,260
l have a past in between
my college days and the workshop

1576
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:08,402
What was that past life?

1577
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:14,765
Were you the one who splashed mud on
Gautham!

1578
01:30:15,042 --> 01:30:16,475
lf so, what will you do?

1579
01:30:17,111 --> 01:30:20,205
Mummy used to say, don't hit the one,
who doesn't have a hockey stick in hand

1580
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:21,382
Give him a stick

01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:24,217
-First, fight with my boys
- Come..Come one by one.

1582

No , no... He is good at bashing

1605
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:43,063
Hey, wrap the stick in my hand

1606
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:48,391
Oh no!

1607
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:52,395
He held that too. Both are locked.

1608
01:31:52,907 --> 01:31:54,067
Don't wrap my hand

1609
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:58,071
Oh no, bro! ln an excitement l have done all this

1610
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,338
Unfasten it! Unfasten it, dude!

1611
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,379
Let me teach you today

1612

l will go and come back in the morning.

1613
01:32:02,250 --> 01:32:04,377
l will come back in the morning after my tea.

1614
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:09,385
Oh no! O Mummy!

1615
01:32:25,106 --> 01:32:25,902
Gautham, what are you doing here?

1616
01:32:27,108 --> 01:32:27,403
Eh!

1617
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:29,567
What are you doing here?

1618
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:34,407

1619
01:32:34,515 --> 01:32:35,413
Come on, sit.

1620
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:38,249
Come on, Gautham.

1621
01:32:41,622 --> 01:32:43,590
-ls there no helmet? - lt's over there.

1622
01:32:49,130 --> 01:32:50,597
These are the famous shacks over here.

1623
01:32:53,134 --> 01:32:57,264
Are you afraid to sit on the
back of two wheeler also now?

1624
01:32:58,639 --> 01:32:59,435
What? - Yes

1625
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:01,574
Really? l will change that right away.

1626
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:03,911
Slowly..Slowly...O God, slowly.

1627
01:33:04,111 --> 01:33:05,578
We are about to fly

1628
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:10,577
Oh no! Please sit down..Please.

1629
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:34,369
Ok? Come, Gautham, let's go one more time!

1630
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:37,102
Hey please..Please..Leave me..

1631
01:33:50,925 --> 01:33:56,420
''ln my memories often,

1632
01:33:56,631 --> 01:34:02,365

1633
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:07,906
''the leaves and flowers damp with
the mist of forgetfulness,

1634
01:34:08,309 --> 01:34:13,713
O Love, you touched like breeze''

1635
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:26,084
''The smile of that day will again
fall like wine drops''

1636
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:37,534
''The feather of memory which fell on the way,
flew down in my heart''

1637
01:34:37,772 --> 01:34:42,732
''And again a song flowed from my stone-body
melting silently in this path''

1638
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:48,571
''ln my memories often,

1639
01:34:49,116 --> 01:34:54,713
everyday you came searching for me''

1640
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:29,746
''You are a sky which doesn't know that l'm a
cloud wandering to join you in this way''

1641
01:35:30,124 --> 01:35:40,762
''O moon-flower of love with unshedding
petals''

1642
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:46,268
''You are a shoreless sea, a wound, giving
pleasure,

1643
01:35:46,474 --> 01:35:52,743
Fall on me again and again
and fill the goblet of heart each minute''

1644
01:35:53,147 --> 01:35:58,449
''ln my memories often,

1645
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:04,691

1646
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:21,604
''ln my memories often,

1647
01:36:22,143 --> 01:36:27,513

1648
01:36:27,815 --> 01:36:33,447
''The leaves and flowers damp with
the mist of forgetfulness,

1649
01:36:33,654 --> 01:36:39,615
O Love, you touched like breeze''

1650
01:36:39,794 --> 01:36:42,456
Doctor, l am unable to say anything or propose

1651
01:36:54,809 --> 01:36:56,140
lt is my heart

1652
01:36:56,677 --> 01:36:57,473
Take it.

1653
01:37:00,314 --> 01:37:04,751
You wicked! You cheat! l will kill you

1654
01:37:05,152 --> 01:37:07,746
You cheat!

1655
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:09,281
l will kill you.

1656
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:10,457
You die..Die

1657
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:22,467
''The smile of that day will again
fall like wine drops''

1658
01:37:23,337 --> 01:37:34,271
''The feather of memory which fell on the way
flew down in my heart''

1659
01:37:34,648 --> 01:37:40,280
''And again a song flowed from my stone-body
melting silently in this path''

1660
01:37:55,669 --> 01:37:56,761
Gautham, relax

1661
01:37:57,805 --> 01:37:58,737
Take 2 tablets!

1662
01:37:59,173 --> 01:38:02,438
Not necessary, doctor! l think she still loves
me.

1663
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:06,273
But l'm not able to express what is in my mind.

1664
01:38:06,580 --> 01:38:07,444
Why?

1665
01:38:11,785 --> 01:38:14,447
Gautham, you have a good job.

1666
01:38:15,322 --> 01:38:16,448
You have a good family.

1667
01:38:17,324 --> 01:38:18,621
You got everything.

1668
01:38:19,493 --> 01:38:21,290
And you have a good Doctor.

1669
01:38:21,996 --> 01:38:23,463
Express it courageously

1670
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:24,631
Will you be able to express it, doctor?

1671
01:38:25,332 --> 01:38:26,458
Moreover you have experience also.

1672
01:38:26,667 --> 01:38:28,294
You loved and married your patient.

1673
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:30,561
Don't ever remind me that.

1674
01:38:30,804 --> 01:38:34,763
To forget that, you know how many times
l hypnotized my own self?

1675
01:38:35,009 --> 01:38:36,567
You must help me, doctor.

1676
01:38:38,679 --> 01:38:39,771
And don't bother about the fees.

1677
01:38:40,648 --> 01:38:44,277
Thought you can buy me that easily for money!

1678
01:38:44,818 --> 01:38:45,785
l'm ready to pay how much you ask

1679
01:38:45,986 --> 01:38:46,418
No.

1680
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:47,281
l will transfer it right today

1681
01:38:47,488 --> 01:38:47,783
No way

1682
01:38:47,988 --> 01:38:48,784
What if l give a Blank cheque?

1683
01:38:58,832 --> 01:38:59,628
Why are you here?

1684
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,633
l'm waiting for my friends.

1685
01:39:02,836 --> 01:39:03,803
And, Uncle why are you here?

1686
01:39:04,004 --> 01:39:06,973
l thought of resolving a patient's silly love

1687
01:39:07,341 --> 01:39:09,741
So you became a marriage broker as well!

1688
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:12,808
Why don't you move out. l want some privacy.

1689
01:39:13,547 --> 01:39:13,979
Oh!

1690
01:39:14,315 --> 01:39:15,304
There is Shreya, buddy!

1691
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:16,516
Did you have this drink?

1692
01:39:16,684 --> 01:39:18,515
-No- Don't... leave.

1693
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:21,883
-Eh-Yourfriends are calling you, go then

1694
01:39:22,756 --> 01:39:23,313
Ok

1695
01:39:24,525 --> 01:39:25,492
Hey coming..coming.

1696
01:39:25,759 --> 01:39:26,657
Not to be seen!

1697
01:39:27,528 --> 01:39:29,655
New Generation girls, isn't it?
Will miss the time!

1698
01:39:37,037 --> 01:39:37,833
What did she say, Doctor?

1699
01:39:38,772 --> 01:39:40,000
l'll tell you, sit down.

1700
01:39:40,341 --> 01:39:42,502
Doctor, l can't sit.
Tell me what did she say?

1701
01:39:42,743 --> 01:39:45,303
Gautam, Love has a certain rhythm

1702
01:39:45,746 --> 01:39:47,304
Sometimes it may lose sync.

1703
01:39:48,349 --> 01:39:50,817
We should be careful for it not to impact
the rhythm of our life

1704
01:39:51,852 --> 01:39:52,648
Take this tablet

1705
01:39:54,755 --> 01:39:56,723
Some girls will promise to come
but may not come

1706
01:39:57,024 --> 01:39:57,991
But she did come.

1707
01:39:58,859 --> 01:40:00,656
Had she come, wouldn't l have
spoken to her?

1708
01:40:00,861 --> 01:40:01,828
But you did.

1709
01:40:02,563 --> 01:40:04,827
Me? Spoke?

1710
01:40:05,366 --> 01:40:05,661
Yes!

1711
01:40:05,866 --> 01:40:06,730
You saw that, Gautham?

1712
01:40:07,034 --> 01:40:07,659
Yes!

1713
01:40:08,769 --> 01:40:09,827
Hmm, lmaginary friend!

1714
01:40:10,571 --> 01:40:12,732
this...ln Psychiatry, its called..something..

1715
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,007
l forgot. Will let you know tomorrow.

1716
01:40:14,375 --> 01:40:16,343
For the time being, take this tablet and relax.

1717
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:17,339
Doctor, she did come,

1718
01:40:17,578 --> 01:40:19,671
you met her and drank her orange juice also.

1719
01:40:20,547 --> 01:40:24,506
-That is..Shreya, isn't it? - Yes, Shreya!

1720
01:40:26,353 --> 01:40:27,820
-Shreya? - Shreya!

1721
01:40:29,023 --> 01:40:31,514
You mean my Shreya?

1722
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:33,520
Doctor's Shreya! Mine too.

1723
01:40:33,761 --> 01:40:35,319
l can't live without her

1724
01:40:36,563 --> 01:40:36,995
Do you mind?

1725
01:40:46,573 --> 01:40:48,006
-Shreya? - Shreya!

1726
01:40:56,350 --> 01:40:56,816
Doctor!

1727
01:40:57,785 --> 01:40:58,809
l'm sleeping. Get lost

1728
01:40:59,787 --> 01:41:01,516
Good night, doctor. Thank you.

1729
01:41:05,859 --> 01:41:08,987
What l don't understand is
..what sort of masseur are they?

1730
01:41:09,363 --> 01:41:11,365
Bloody massage!

1731
01:41:11,365 --> 01:41:13,833
Pain wasn't so much even when that
fatso lady flogged me with the hockey stick.

1732
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:16,536
What is all this?

1733
01:41:16,804 --> 01:41:17,998
We got ourselves massaged!

1734
01:41:18,806 --> 01:41:19,670
Then, what happened?

1735
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:22,133
Actually those guys were loggers from the
forest.

1736
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:24,066
They don't know how to massage, doctor!

1737
01:41:24,178 --> 01:41:28,137
What brings me here is...
l need a favour from you guys

1738
01:41:28,849 --> 01:41:31,147
Please ask, Doctor. What support you want?

1739
01:41:32,019 --> 01:41:33,748
l've no children.

1740
01:41:34,021 --> 01:41:35,147
l can help you, doctor.

1741
01:41:38,025 --> 01:41:40,152
You are the only one
l did not give any medicines?

1742
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:43,154
l've medicine for that, shall l?

1743
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:44,956
-You want? - No.

1744
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:46,760
l will help you, doctor.

1745
01:41:47,034 --> 01:41:48,001
Please tell me.

1746
01:41:48,202 --> 01:41:50,602
- Please tell me, l will also help. - Me too!

1747
01:41:50,804 --> 01:41:52,669
He will not tell you because he doesn't like you.

1748
01:41:52,873 --> 01:41:57,674
ln our family, when we mean next generation,
there is one and only person.

1749
01:41:58,212 --> 01:41:59,179
..that is Shreya!

1750
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:02,515
Don't frighten the doctor.

1751
01:42:04,551 --> 01:42:08,647
lf the man marrying her
is a person of no mental stability,

1752
01:42:09,022 --> 01:42:10,148
l hope you understand.

1753
01:42:11,558 --> 01:42:11,990
Ok

1754
01:42:13,193 --> 01:42:15,661
Doctor, my neck will get hurt

1755
01:42:16,864 --> 01:42:19,526
You may use all your sweetness,

1756
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,167
and please have him leave this place..

1757
01:42:21,568 --> 01:42:23,001
Doctor, l will do as you said

1758
01:42:26,206 --> 01:42:28,766
Thank you. What obedient patients!

1759
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:31,010
-Go, mind your own business
- Eh..Three ldiots!

1760
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:34,177
Would he burn down the bar?

1761
01:42:34,581 --> 01:42:35,548
Dude! Be careful!

1762
01:42:38,218 --> 01:42:40,015
Buddy, got money for drinks?

1763
01:42:40,220 --> 01:42:42,188
-l got nothing - Nothing?

1764
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:43,853
What do we drink, then?

1765
01:42:47,794 --> 01:42:50,194
-Accept Card? - Hmm, yes we do!

1766
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:51,698
-Ring? - Eh!

1767
01:42:52,232 --> 01:42:53,529
What do you guys actually want?

1768
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:57,029
Give us the.... cheapest liquor here

1769
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:00,172
Shreya, actually we came here is..

1770
01:43:00,774 --> 01:43:02,674
to tell you an important thing.

1771
01:43:03,210 --> 01:43:06,008
Because l don't understand, l'm asking you..

1772
01:43:06,213 --> 01:43:07,680
What is wrong with you, guys?

1773
01:43:07,881 --> 01:43:09,746
With a mission to rekindle an old love that

1774
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:11,540
you and Gautham had forgotten,
we came to Goa.

1775
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:13,015
Yes! Mission Goa!

1776
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:14,187
Ok then, tell me..

1777
01:43:14,888 --> 01:43:15,547
Will you marry him?

1778
01:43:16,223 --> 01:43:16,689
Tell.

1779
01:43:16,890 --> 01:43:20,018
So you guys have come up with the proposal!

1780
01:43:20,227 --> 01:43:20,852
Yes!

1781
01:43:21,895 --> 01:43:23,692
lnfact it is not you guys who
should actually propose

1782
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:24,192
Then whom?

1783
01:43:24,598 --> 01:43:26,964
-Gautham's father...that great professor - Hmm..

1784
01:43:27,801 --> 01:43:28,768
Let him come and propose!

1785
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:30,195
Then, l shall think over.

1786
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:33,198
So you wish to become Gautham's mother?

1787
01:43:34,074 --> 01:43:36,702
l will convey my interest to him.

1788
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:39,708
Take your shot and leave. l'll pay for your
drinks

1789
01:43:39,913 --> 01:43:42,177
You're paying? Give one more then.

1790
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:43,174
Just a minute.

1791
01:43:52,059 --> 01:43:52,855
Good morning, sir.

1792
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:54,853
We reached..

1793
01:43:55,229 --> 01:43:56,196
..a bit early.

1794
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,698
And didn't wish to disturb your sleep.

1795
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:00,700
Wife is in the Car. l'll go and call her.

1796
01:44:00,901 --> 01:44:02,698
Sir, wait. l will go and call Ma'am

1797
01:44:02,903 --> 01:44:04,029
You please get in, sir.

1798
01:44:04,605 --> 01:44:05,572
Good morning, ma'am

1799
01:44:06,907 --> 01:44:07,874
Good morning, Shreya!

1800
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:10,972
Please come.

1801
01:44:12,045 --> 01:44:13,842
l couldn't recognize you

1802
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:16,014
You look different.

1803
01:44:16,216 --> 01:44:17,843
l'm altogether a different person now, ma'am

1804
01:44:20,053 --> 01:44:21,020
Thanks to Professor!

1805
01:44:28,729 --> 01:44:30,026
Gautham and friends are sound asleep!

1806
01:44:30,230 --> 01:44:31,697
l tried to wake them but they're in deep sleep.

1807
01:44:32,599 --> 01:44:36,695
Doctor, it was your advise had had me to
reunite Gautham with his old friends.

1808
01:44:36,903 --> 01:44:40,168
But l never expected that your niece
also be there amongst them!

1809
01:44:40,607 --> 01:44:41,164
Me too.

1810
01:44:43,210 --> 01:44:43,767
-Aunty - No.

1811
01:44:44,044 --> 01:44:45,011
Only sambar!

1812
01:44:45,812 --> 01:44:48,679
He liked Shreya a lot ever since he was
studying

1813
01:44:49,049 --> 01:44:51,142
And she got the punishment forthat also!

1814
01:44:53,053 --> 01:44:57,683
We do give small punishments
to children in orderto mend them.

1815
01:44:57,891 --> 01:44:58,858
That's for the betterment of the children.

1816
01:44:59,226 --> 01:45:02,559
But some punishments, would haunt them
lifelong.

1817
01:45:04,064 --> 01:45:07,033
And one of the victim is your son Gautham.

1818
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:07,862
But..

1819
01:45:09,069 --> 01:45:11,196
Do you know who is suffering
the most from that punishment?

1820
01:45:11,905 --> 01:45:12,564
lt is she.

1821
01:45:19,913 --> 01:45:21,005
Why do you come to College?

1822
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:22,010
To study...

1823
01:45:22,215 --> 01:45:25,184
orto flirt with handsome boys? Come on.

1824
01:45:25,886 --> 01:45:26,784
Please talk a bit more decently, sir.

1825
01:45:27,054 --> 01:45:29,022
l can't be more decent than this!

1826
01:45:29,222 --> 01:45:32,623
To talk so rudely, ourfriendship
has not affected our studies.

1827
01:45:32,826 --> 01:45:33,383
lt will.

1828
01:45:33,727 --> 01:45:34,785
l have come across such cases.

1829
01:45:35,062 --> 01:45:37,189
But l won't let you drag my son into it.

1830
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:41,026
You mean to say that you will
terminate me for this?

1831
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:42,201
l can't do that.

1832
01:45:42,436 --> 01:45:44,028
But l opted another way.

1833
01:45:44,237 --> 01:45:46,205
l informed your father.

1834
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:49,034
that you're coming to college not to study
but to love.

1835
01:45:49,242 --> 01:45:52,040
and if you are allowed to be wayward
this College will get a bad name!

1836
01:45:59,252 --> 01:46:01,220
Oh, you started doing alone today?

1837
01:46:02,255 --> 01:46:04,723
Yes! l came a bit early today, come.

1838
01:46:05,258 --> 01:46:07,726
Must have it before it gets cold!

1839
01:46:08,829 --> 01:46:10,228
-Let me wash my hands - Hmm.

1840
01:46:14,434 --> 01:46:16,732
l made all your favourite dishes! Take.

1841
01:46:17,104 --> 01:46:18,071
O fantastic!

1842
01:46:18,271 --> 01:46:19,397
Taste them and comment about it

1843
01:46:21,074 --> 01:46:24,874
-We'll get bored to eat the same
old dishes always. - Hmm.

1844
01:46:25,912 --> 01:46:28,710
Similarly living in the same house,
don't you get bored?

1845
01:46:28,915 --> 01:46:30,212
l've been telling you this for a long time,

1846
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:32,218
about moving to a Villa or a flat.

1847
01:46:32,452 --> 01:46:33,419
You never listen.

1848
01:46:34,254 --> 01:46:36,222
After sometimes, will get bored living there
also.

1849
01:46:37,090 --> 01:46:37,886
l didn't mean that.

1850
01:46:38,258 --> 01:46:38,724
We shall..

1851
01:46:39,926 --> 01:46:41,223
..move to Goa!

1852
01:46:42,829 --> 01:46:44,057
Your mother's relatives are there!

1853
01:46:45,098 --> 01:46:47,430
-Professor contacted you, is it? - Hmm!

1854
01:46:49,102 --> 01:46:50,729
lt is not because of that.

1855
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:52,905
He contacted me for some otherthings.

1856
01:46:53,473 --> 01:46:56,067
ln Goa, you will get many new friends

1857
01:46:56,276 --> 01:46:57,243
Good place too!

1858
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:59,744
No need of this college. Heed my words.

1859
01:46:59,946 --> 01:47:00,412
Father!

1860
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,978
l'll go to that College and do my studies.

1861
01:47:04,818 --> 01:47:06,410
Let me see what he does!

1862
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,220
What will he do?

1863
01:47:09,923 --> 01:47:12,721
Listen to me dear. No need of this College!

1864
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:14,723
l will go to that college

1865
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,427
Won't you heed my words?

1866
01:47:17,831 --> 01:47:20,732
Whatever you say also,
l will only go to that college.

1867
01:47:23,770 --> 01:47:24,896
Then do as you please.

1868
01:47:34,247 --> 01:47:36,442
Father..Father.

1869
01:47:37,484 --> 01:47:40,885
l need your permission to make a friend.
ls that what you are saying

1870
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:42,717
l didn't mean it

1871
01:47:43,256 --> 01:47:46,885
Till now, we make decisions
only after discussing each other.

1872
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:50,887
Even my personal things, have l done anything
without consulting you?

1873
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:53,729
Lets follow that in future also
is all what l meant.

1874
01:47:54,935 --> 01:47:56,061
What should l do now?

1875
01:47:56,937 --> 01:47:59,064
Shouldn't have any contacts with that guy

1876
01:47:59,940 --> 01:48:01,475
You should neither meet him nor talk to him

1877
01:48:01,475 --> 01:48:02,533
Not even a phone call.

1878
01:48:04,911 --> 01:48:06,003
This is the issue, right?

1879
01:48:06,246 --> 01:48:06,871
Hey..

1880
01:48:07,848 --> 01:48:08,212
Dear..

1881
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:10,415
What next?

1882
01:48:11,918 --> 01:48:14,216
You shouldn't go to that college.

1883
01:48:17,090 --> 01:48:17,419
Ok

1884
01:48:28,268 --> 01:48:30,236
Next..Should l also jump?

1885
01:48:30,470 --> 01:48:31,437
-l will do that also - Hey.

1886
01:48:32,105 --> 01:48:33,504
-Father, leave me. - What are you upto?

1887
01:48:33,874 --> 01:48:36,276
Leave me father! Professor is important
to you than me.

1888
01:48:36,276 --> 01:48:38,244
Move away! Move l say!

1889
01:48:41,081 --> 01:48:41,877
Father!

1890
01:48:48,255 --> 01:48:50,052
For a long time, he was hospitalized

1891
01:48:50,257 --> 01:48:52,054
Just managed to have him back alive!

1892
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:56,218
Today even to drink water,
he needs Shreya's help now.

1893
01:48:58,865 --> 01:49:01,026
Now her life is all about her dad

1894
01:49:02,469 --> 01:49:05,905
She doesn't want anything else
in her life, is her decision

1895
01:49:07,474 --> 01:49:10,568
She is punishing herself for
the mistake she has done

1896
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:13,572
What is this dad?

1897
01:49:15,115 --> 01:49:16,912
Don't think about the past.

1898
01:49:17,484 --> 01:49:18,451
Am l not here, father?.

1899
01:49:20,453 --> 01:49:24,253
As a diversion to it,
she made a career in Adventurous sports!

1900
01:49:24,624 --> 01:49:26,251
She passed all tests!

1901
01:49:28,128 --> 01:49:28,423
But...

1902
01:49:45,478 --> 01:49:46,570
l can't jump.

1903
01:49:52,118 --> 01:49:54,586
Might've got the licence
if she had cleared the test too.

1904
01:49:56,656 --> 01:49:58,487
She also lost her career that she aspired for.

1905
01:50:08,702 --> 01:50:09,600
-Sorry - lt's ok.

1906
01:50:12,505 --> 01:50:13,267
What happened to your father?.

1907
01:50:14,140 --> 01:50:15,471
l got nothing to say, Gautham.

1908
01:50:15,976 --> 01:50:17,603
Hereafter don't try to meet me or call me.

1909
01:50:18,144 --> 01:50:20,578
lf there is any friendship between us,
that ends right here!

1910
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:23,472
What are you talking? What is my mistake?

1911
01:50:23,683 --> 01:50:24,650
Who is Mr Menon's attendant?

1912
01:50:25,118 --> 01:50:26,483
-Sister, l. - Please come.

1913
01:50:35,128 --> 01:50:37,460
The number you are calling is not reachable.

1914
01:50:37,697 --> 01:50:39,255
Please call again later.

1915
01:50:39,499 --> 01:50:41,490
You are not dialing a valid number.

1916
01:50:41,701 --> 01:50:43,601
Please check the number you have dialed

1917
01:50:44,704 --> 01:50:47,673
You are not dialing a valid number.

1918
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:49,938
Please check the number.

1919
01:50:50,276 --> 01:50:52,676
Gautham wants to join film school.

1920
01:50:53,113 --> 01:50:54,239
Wishes to study Screenplay Writing.

1921
01:50:54,514 --> 01:50:57,574
Not necessary. Let him do
what he is studying now.

1922
01:51:00,487 --> 01:51:02,250
Son, what father says is..

1923
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:03,251
l heard.

1924
01:51:11,131 --> 01:51:13,929
But never ask me to study hereafter.

1925
01:51:17,370 --> 01:51:19,463
l tried speaking to her a lot

1926
01:51:20,373 --> 01:51:20,998
But...

1927
01:51:22,509 --> 01:51:23,669
Don't take it seriously

1928
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:25,735
We will speak to her again.

1929
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:30,238
Shreya's education, career, family..

1930
01:51:31,484 --> 01:51:34,453
After shattering all her happiness,
how do you still talk like this, dad?

1931
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:38,451
That day it was for me you did everything.

1932
01:51:39,125 --> 01:51:40,456
Now also, it is only for me you have come..

1933
01:51:40,794 --> 01:51:42,261
and not because of any love for her, isn't it?

1934
01:51:45,498 --> 01:51:46,021
Don't...

1935
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,462
Don't speak to her about this anymore...
No one must!

1936
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:52,599
Son - l want to be alone for some time.

1937
01:51:55,308 --> 01:51:57,469
Don't worry, sir. We will sort it out.

1938
01:51:57,811 --> 01:51:58,778
We are there with him!

1939
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:11,352
You must take a decision in Gautam's matter.

1940
01:52:12,125 --> 01:52:13,752
What my father said before
becoming bedridden was,

1941
01:52:14,294 --> 01:52:16,057
l should not have any contacts with Gautham

1942
01:52:16,796 --> 01:52:19,663
Only for the sake of our friendship,
l'm helping him.

1943
01:52:26,573 --> 01:52:27,665
-Hey, Gautham! - Hey!

1944
01:52:29,442 --> 01:52:30,500
l wanted to tell you something

1945
01:52:30,710 --> 01:52:31,267
What?

1946
01:52:32,445 --> 01:52:35,073
We may not get the life we desire of!

1947
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:38,016
Take my life.

1948
01:52:38,451 --> 01:52:39,645
l was forced to choose this.

1949
01:52:40,253 --> 01:52:42,016
And..l'm happy with it.

1950
01:52:43,423 --> 01:52:44,651
You should also be like that.

1951
01:52:46,059 --> 01:52:47,321
Choose your life

1952
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,221
And you should be happy in your life.

1953
01:52:49,562 --> 01:52:55,023
Don't move on, as they say like someone
having taken a hit on his head.. Please.

1954
01:52:56,436 --> 01:52:57,027
Ok!

1955
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,236
And that's it!

1956
01:53:03,376 --> 01:53:03,603
Ok!

1957
01:53:10,416 --> 01:53:11,383
He has finished packing

1958
01:53:11,684 --> 01:53:13,618
lf he is not willing to open his heart
what can we do?

1959
01:53:13,887 --> 01:53:16,219
Still, we could speak to her!

1960
01:53:16,556 --> 01:53:20,219
Love that we don't get when asked for,
we should shoot for it

1961
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:28,527
This is the umpteenth oranges
she has shot at me!

1962
01:53:29,569 --> 01:53:31,230
What am l to say? Curse of beauty!

1963
01:53:32,372 --> 01:53:32,861
Curse of beauty!

1964
01:53:36,576 --> 01:53:38,237
l love sweet oranges.

1965
01:53:38,578 --> 01:53:39,340
But what to do?

1966
01:53:39,579 --> 01:53:41,376
l already have a big plumpy orange at home.

1967
01:53:41,548 --> 01:53:44,210
Unrequited love is more painful, dear!

1968
01:53:44,417 --> 01:53:46,214
Eat this. From the countryside

1969
01:53:46,419 --> 01:53:47,215
Everything will be alright.

1970
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:50,515
Fed up with these fans!

1971
01:53:51,724 --> 01:53:52,691
-Gautham - Yes.

1972
01:53:54,427 --> 01:53:56,224
Why don't we speak to her, Gautham?

1973
01:53:56,563 --> 01:53:58,394
Not necessary!

1974
01:53:58,731 --> 01:54:01,495
l don't think it's right to return
without talking to her.

1975
01:54:01,734 --> 01:54:02,701
l already spoke to her.

1976
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:04,298
lt's all over.

1977
01:54:05,905 --> 01:54:06,872
ls the packing over?

1978
01:54:07,740 --> 01:54:08,798
Packing is over

1979
01:54:09,542 --> 01:54:11,339
But what you done to us is not fair?

1980
01:54:11,578 --> 01:54:12,101
What happened?

1981
01:54:12,545 --> 01:54:15,878
You took him to the Sea
and did Jet skiing, Water sports

1982
01:54:16,449 --> 01:54:17,882
-We are also your friends - True!

1983
01:54:18,818 --> 01:54:21,685
Forget the Sea, we weren't even taken
to a stream in Goa!

1984
01:54:21,921 --> 01:54:24,219
-ls that your issue? - Yes!

1985
01:54:24,591 --> 01:54:26,388
Ok, l will get it done right away.

1986
01:54:28,595 --> 01:54:31,564
Didn't we stop Christy's marriage
and bring her to you?

1987
01:54:32,398 --> 01:54:33,558
Now give us a chance.

1988
01:54:36,436 --> 01:54:40,236
Thannann Thaaannan in rhythm we sung

1989
01:54:40,440 --> 01:54:43,238
On the tree in a swing we also swung

1990
01:54:43,443 --> 01:54:46,879
Hey, wasn't this the same song
you worked on Christy too?

1991
01:54:47,280 --> 01:54:50,215
Well, the song is the same but that is not this.

1992
01:54:50,717 --> 01:54:53,242
We came here to reunite both of you.

1993
01:54:53,453 --> 01:54:55,250
lf that doesn't happen, we will not go back

1994
01:54:55,722 --> 01:54:56,950
We'll jump into the sea and die.

1995
01:54:59,392 --> 01:55:00,359
-Hey.. - Jyothi be careful, dude!

1996
01:55:00,593 --> 01:55:01,958
Get up, boys! Get up l say.

1997
01:55:03,930 --> 01:55:05,625
Hey you..What are you guys upto?

1998
01:55:05,999 --> 01:55:07,967
Didn't we say, we will jump and die

1999
01:55:08,601 --> 01:55:11,968
Ok, but if you jump with a lifejacket on,
how will you die?

2000
01:55:12,939 --> 01:55:13,963
Will only float in water, nah!

2001
01:55:15,742 --> 01:55:16,572
Won't we die?

2002
01:55:17,944 --> 01:55:18,501
Sit down, boys.

2003
01:55:22,815 --> 01:55:24,282
Would it work if we sing another song...

2004
01:55:24,517 --> 01:55:25,279
..of Raghavan master's!

2005
01:55:25,518 --> 01:55:26,678
Also AR Rehman's will also do.

2006
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:30,618
Dude! lt's not that l don't understand

2007
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:33,618
But leaving my father in this condition,

2008
01:55:34,594 --> 01:55:36,687
l can't think of another life.

2009
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:39,260
What will happen to your life then, Shreya?

2010
01:55:39,732 --> 01:55:40,255
Subahan!

2011
01:55:45,471 --> 01:55:46,699
Hello, let's go back

2012
01:56:13,466 --> 01:56:14,364
You die, bloody! You die!

2013
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:16,363
l'm back again..

2014
01:56:16,602 --> 01:56:17,398
Shall we move, bro?

2015
01:56:24,911 --> 01:56:26,970
Hey Gautham!

2016
01:56:41,027 --> 01:56:41,550
Come man!

2017
01:56:57,477 --> 01:56:59,672
Did you think that lf you hand me over to
police, l would be behind bars always

2018
01:57:00,346 --> 01:57:00,971
l'm different!

2019
01:57:09,922 --> 01:57:13,085
Chinnamani is an innocent man
and l'm very sure about it.

2020
01:57:13,459 --> 01:57:17,555
To rescue an ordinary beggar,
you the most prominent lawyer in lndia ,

2021
01:57:17,764 --> 01:57:19,732
Flew down from Delhi, what is the
motive behind that?

2022
01:57:19,932 --> 01:57:22,332
On behalf of which Mafia,
did you take on this case?

2023
01:57:23,703 --> 01:57:26,536
That Mafia, l could have it send
to your home! Shall l?

2024
01:57:26,939 --> 01:57:28,531
Not necessary sir. They may lose their way!

2025
01:57:30,676 --> 01:57:32,576
You know who is the next target?

2026
01:57:32,745 --> 01:57:34,713
Your girl friend Shreya!

2027
01:57:36,482 --> 01:57:38,541
How will you rescue your Shreya? Tell me.

2028
01:57:38,684 --> 01:57:39,548
Try if you can!

2029
01:57:54,801 --> 01:57:55,927
l will surely kill you

2030
01:59:00,466 --> 01:59:01,558
Look properly..

2031
01:59:02,101 --> 01:59:02,863
Hey look there..

2032
01:59:15,081 --> 01:59:16,048
Go that side and look

2033
01:59:16,749 --> 01:59:17,716
Hey look properly

2034
01:59:18,584 --> 01:59:20,051
Rexi.. Rexi..

2035
01:59:21,787 --> 01:59:22,685
Shreya..

2036
01:59:23,089 --> 01:59:24,215
We are trying everything, Sir

2037
01:59:24,624 --> 01:59:25,682
Body has not yet been spotted..

2038
01:59:26,092 --> 01:59:27,184
There are no signs yet..

2039
01:59:28,094 --> 01:59:28,651
Yes Sir,

2040
01:59:28,861 --> 01:59:30,055
Dude.. Hold him.. Subhan..

2041
01:59:30,730 --> 01:59:31,219
Rexxie..

2042
01:59:31,597 --> 01:59:31,824
Sir,

2043
01:59:32,165 --> 01:59:32,824
there is no hope, Sir..

2044
01:59:33,266 --> 01:59:34,198
We are coming back..

2045
01:59:37,103 --> 01:59:38,968
Hey don't.. don't go, he left us..

2046
01:59:39,605 --> 01:59:40,663
Leave.. Leave.. return

2047
01:59:41,274 --> 01:59:42,172
All move..

2048
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:52,512
Son...

2049
01:59:52,685 --> 01:59:54,516
Want to see.... My son..

2050
02:00:10,102 --> 02:00:12,536
lf one were to ask what is the world's greatest
mystery..

2051
02:00:13,105 --> 02:00:15,699
l would say that is our Life..

2052
02:00:16,108 --> 02:00:18,076
Without knowing what awaits us in the next
moment,

2053
02:00:18,611 --> 02:00:22,274
we travel every day, every night..

2054
02:00:22,615 --> 02:00:24,583
Oh My God.. Daddy, Daddy

2055
02:00:25,117 --> 02:00:25,913
Hey.. Come.. come running...

2056
02:00:26,285 --> 02:00:28,253
What is it you hollering for?

2057
02:00:28,621 --> 02:00:29,246
There.. take a look

2058
02:00:29,622 --> 02:00:30,589
Hey..

2059
02:00:31,290 --> 02:00:33,588
Oh Lord! There again..

2060
02:00:33,759 --> 02:00:35,158
What a job, this....

2061
02:00:36,295 --> 02:00:38,263
Who is this new Merman?

2062
02:00:38,631 --> 02:00:39,598
Don't know, Dad?

2063
02:00:39,765 --> 02:00:41,756
Open the gills and see whether the
dead body is still alive..

2064
02:00:41,968 --> 02:00:42,593
Yes dad

2065
02:00:42,802 --> 02:00:43,666
Can't believe...

2066
02:00:44,804 --> 02:00:45,828
Move aside

2067
02:00:46,806 --> 02:00:48,967
Son..where are you from?

2068
02:00:49,308 --> 02:00:50,138
Where is your home?

2069
02:00:52,278 --> 02:00:54,576
Didn't understand! Udupi..Spitting see. (
Hospet... spitting... look).

2070
02:00:54,814 --> 02:00:56,645
Hey lift him up.. He is alive..

2071
02:00:59,619 --> 02:01:01,519
Hi..Dad.. have tea

2072
02:01:01,787 --> 02:01:02,651
He is my son..

2073
02:01:02,855 --> 02:01:03,879
Name Bheeman. (Hulk).

2074
02:01:04,190 --> 02:01:05,521
Named not because of his size..

2075
02:01:05,725 --> 02:01:06,589
But the way he hogs..

2076
02:01:07,126 --> 02:01:08,650
Go and hold the net

2077
02:01:09,295 --> 02:01:12,162
Watch out! Northern breeze is coming..
Hold on and go carefully Bheeman

2078
02:01:12,565 --> 02:01:13,896
The other day he flew away..

2079
02:01:14,800 --> 02:01:15,698
What is your name?

2080
02:01:15,901 --> 02:01:16,663
Ramanan

2081
02:01:17,637 --> 02:01:19,969
Banning trawling in the seas is
not an issue for Ramanan

2082
02:01:20,206 --> 02:01:22,299
Ramanan is present all through
in the internet trolling..

2083
02:01:22,708 --> 02:01:24,175
Now this Ramanan is a troll model

2084
02:01:24,644 --> 02:01:26,111
l am now famous

2085
02:01:28,781 --> 02:01:29,907
Dear Gotham..

2086
02:01:30,316 --> 02:01:31,078
Not Gotham.. it is Gautam..

2087
02:01:31,284 --> 02:01:32,080
Whatever it be..

2088
02:01:32,318 --> 02:01:35,879
Let me tell you from what l got in my experience
as a survivor of doing business in Goa

2089
02:01:36,222 --> 02:01:37,883
There will be numerous problems in life..

2090
02:01:38,224 --> 02:01:41,660
Tie them all up behind a boat...

2091
02:01:41,927 --> 02:01:42,689
Then?

2092
02:01:42,895 --> 02:01:44,988
Then, drive the boat into deep sea..

2093
02:01:45,231 --> 02:01:45,697
Then..

2094
02:01:45,998 --> 02:01:47,158
Won't a decision be reached then?

2095
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:51,727
Our life is not meant forthose fishes
in the sea to prick and chew on..

2096
02:01:55,341 --> 02:01:56,672
Those there are meant for us to fry and eat
Son, are you getting what l am saying?

2097
02:01:56,909 --> 02:01:59,673
All those dirty guys coming to hook us

2098
02:01:59,879 --> 02:02:00,846
We should tie them up..

2099
02:02:01,113 --> 02:02:02,580
Son.. Give it a try..

2100
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:09,587
Gautham! ldiot! where were you?

2101
02:02:09,789 --> 02:02:10,847
Chill sir

2102
02:02:11,057 --> 02:02:13,355
-Gautham..-l came to say two things..

2103
02:02:13,726 --> 02:02:14,590
-Yes-First...

2104
02:02:14,760 --> 02:02:16,694
Sir, Wasn't someone beating you
up in the nights?

2105
02:02:16,896 --> 02:02:18,329
Yes, someone like Batman..

2106
02:02:18,731 --> 02:02:19,197
That was me.

2107
02:02:19,632 --> 02:02:20,599
Gautham!

2108
02:02:20,766 --> 02:02:21,698
Second thing

2109
02:02:21,901 --> 02:02:22,765
l quit..

2110
02:02:23,769 --> 02:02:25,327
Gautham.. Gautham...

2111
02:02:25,771 --> 02:02:27,705
Gautham.. Please don't leave..

2112
02:02:28,341 --> 02:02:30,673
Several of our projects are pending..

2113
02:02:31,744 --> 02:02:33,837
Come on Gautham... Come on

2114
02:02:34,046 --> 02:02:34,842
l am sorry..

2115
02:02:36,115 --> 02:02:37,776
Dude.. Please Dude..

2116
02:02:38,117 --> 02:02:39,084
l will do anything...

2117
02:02:39,318 --> 02:02:40,376
l will do anything for you..

2118
02:02:41,887 --> 02:02:43,377
-Sure?-Yes..

2119
02:02:44,023 --> 02:02:46,685
Go to the shop below and get
a cup of tea and two cakes

2120
02:02:46,892 --> 02:02:48,086
Quick..

2121
02:02:49,428 --> 02:02:50,861
Why not!

2122
02:02:56,802 --> 02:02:58,633
Why not! lt is my pleasure.

2123
02:03:08,481 --> 02:03:11,143
Based on your description,
in my view that girl.. Chaya..

2124
02:03:11,417 --> 02:03:14,750
-Not Chaya.. Shreya..
-Ok.. she must be searching for you..

2125
02:03:15,454 --> 02:03:17,422
With a wish to meet you once..

2126
02:03:18,457 --> 02:03:20,425
See.. My boss...

2127
02:03:20,793 --> 02:03:22,920
l worked with him for 12 years..

2128
02:03:23,329 --> 02:03:25,092
He did not pay me a single rupee as salary.

2129
02:03:25,331 --> 02:03:26,457
l have cursed him..

2130
02:03:26,799 --> 02:03:29,461
But it was when he died l realised

2131
02:03:29,835 --> 02:03:33,293
That his insurance and this boat were in my
name.

2132
02:03:35,441 --> 02:03:38,410
Often l think, my boss is standing somewhere..

2133
02:03:38,911 --> 02:03:43,371
How much l wish, if l could get to meet him

2134
02:03:43,716 --> 02:03:44,774
Just to seek forgiveness

2135
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,378
Son Gotham..

2136
02:03:49,722 --> 02:03:52,282
Only when we lose something we realize the
pain..

2137
02:03:52,725 --> 02:03:54,283
She would be surely going though that pain...

2138
02:03:54,727 --> 02:03:57,287
That search is the one most unbearable...

2139
02:03:58,964 --> 02:04:02,297
No..Shreya wouldn't be like that..

2140
02:04:02,501 --> 02:04:03,934
Son.. Stand a little away and take a look..

2141
02:04:04,336 --> 02:04:06,736
Then confirm whether Ramanan says is right or
wrong

2142
02:04:06,939 --> 02:04:09,737
Ramanan always says the wrong.
But it will always be the right..

2143
02:04:09,942 --> 02:04:10,772
Sure..

2144
02:04:15,147 --> 02:04:17,945
What a sleep is this! Wake up.

2145
02:04:18,851 --> 02:04:21,217
Today is the date forthe last attempt
to secure the license for skydiving.

2146
02:04:21,887 --> 02:04:22,785
Don't you need to go?

2147
02:04:23,155 --> 02:04:23,519
-Hmmm - Yes?

2148
02:04:24,790 --> 02:04:26,382
Get up .. lazy bum..

2149
02:04:32,164 --> 02:04:33,461
l don't have much intelligence

2150
02:04:34,033 --> 02:04:36,467
Yet based on the knowledge l have l say..

2151
02:04:37,803 --> 02:04:39,464
Take your past life for instance

2152
02:04:39,572 --> 02:04:42,006
there are many people around us

2153
02:04:42,341 --> 02:04:45,538
to give happiness and pain

2154
02:04:46,345 --> 02:04:51,840
But some amongst them turn our life forever,
sure..

2155
02:04:52,785 --> 02:04:57,188
Because of them, we get entangled in
the networks of our own mind!

2156
02:04:59,425 --> 02:05:05,830
That girl is now travelling into a future much
worse than what you have been through.

2157
02:05:06,165 --> 02:05:07,496
You should never let that happen.

2158
02:05:20,179 --> 02:05:20,543
Thank you

2159
02:06:09,161 --> 02:06:10,924
Neither on land nor in water could l ask..

2160
02:06:11,163 --> 02:06:12,425
Could l ask you here?

2161
02:06:12,631 --> 02:06:13,563
Will you marry me?

2162
02:06:15,501 --> 02:06:16,331
Gautham..

2163
02:07:03,515 --> 02:07:08,612
To show someone the most happiest moment
in their life is impossible

2164
02:07:10,189 --> 02:07:13,022
For that, playing a bit of drama is acceptable

2165
02:07:14,193 --> 02:07:15,319
Because one who extends a hand to pull
someone from deep sorrow to utmostjoy

2166
02:07:21,033 --> 02:07:22,557
is in my view the real real role model

2167
02:07:23,369 --> 02:07:29,239
The way l see it... Son, you and yourfriends
are role models..sure..

2168
02:07:29,675 --> 02:07:30,972
Ramanan's Truth!

2169
02:07:31,343 --> 02:07:34,574
''ln my memories often,
everyday you came searching for me''

2170
02:07:36,181 --> 02:07:37,671
Hey Rudra thanks to help me

2171
02:07:38,183 --> 02:07:39,309
Will you marry me?

2172
02:07:40,653 --> 02:07:46,614
''the leaves and flowers damp with
the mist of forgetfulness ,

2173
02:07:46,992 --> 02:07:52,430
O Love, you touched like breeze''

2174
02:07:52,665 --> 02:07:55,600
''The feather of memory which fell on the way,
flew down in my heart''

2175
02:07:55,668 --> 02:07:57,499
-Come..-Go away..

2176
02:07:59,204 --> 02:08:00,330
-Oh God- Why all these?

2177
02:08:00,606 --> 02:08:06,169
Not his idea, it was Subhan

2178
02:08:07,212 --> 02:08:15,449
''The feather of memory which fell on the way,
flew down in my heart''

2179
02:08:16,188 --> 02:08:21,148
''And again a song flowed from my stone-body
melting silently in this path''

2180
02:08:21,527 --> 02:08:33,166
''Everyday you came searching for me
in my memories often''

2181
02:08:35,741 --> 02:08:37,402
-My daughter..- My daughter..

2182
02:08:37,609 --> 02:08:41,136
His daughter... Not your daughter
you are marrying his daughter

2183
02:08:41,413 --> 02:08:44,007
You and he must be said carefully.
Otherwise it will be total confusion..

2184
02:08:51,657 --> 02:08:53,352
Abdul Rahman .. congrats..

2185
02:08:55,127 --> 02:08:56,151
-Hi man... Hi Dude..-

2186
02:08:56,662 --> 02:08:57,321
This is enough

2187
02:08:59,431 --> 02:09:02,195
These are my friends..Gautham, Shreya

2188
02:09:03,435 --> 02:09:06,336

l'll throw you into the well. Are you playing?

2192
02:09:17,516 --> 02:09:19,677
Do you think you can hug all girls? l'll kill you

2193
02:09:23,122 --> 02:09:25,181
-Hey...-Congratulations...

2194
02:09:25,624 --> 02:09:26,386
Hello.. Helloo..

2195
02:09:27,092 --> 02:09:27,786
This is my best friend Jyothish..

2196
02:09:28,627 --> 02:09:30,595
He has taken Make-in-lndia Loan
and has become a big boss..

2197
02:09:30,729 --> 02:09:32,458
Yes.. Export machine. Tools,..

2198
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:36,031
-This is my wife - This should be your wife..

2199
02:09:36,268 --> 02:09:37,257
How does it look like?

2200
02:09:38,437 --> 02:09:39,404
Leave it..

2201
02:09:39,638 --> 02:09:41,401
Take one more..

2202
02:09:47,212 --> 02:09:48,338
-This is my best friend.. Rexi.-Hello

2203
02:09:49,114 --> 02:09:50,308
He is big time into apps

2204
02:09:51,416 --> 02:09:54,351
-Friends this is my latest app-Ok

2205
02:09:57,189 --> 02:10:02,252
Now the unshaded region is A2 + B2 = C2

2206
02:10:02,561 --> 02:10:05,052
Did you notice...my calculations..

2207
02:10:05,430 --> 02:10:06,328
Note how many downloads...

2208
02:10:06,431 --> 02:10:07,659
What is there so much in this?

2209
02:10:08,433 --> 02:10:09,263
Actually...

2210
02:10:09,735 --> 02:10:14,604
See the lakhs coming in this..lakhs..

2211
02:10:15,741 --> 02:10:17,538
Does this silly App get so much cash?

2212
02:10:19,111 --> 02:10:20,669
-Lets take photos..-Yes yes

2213
02:10:21,713 --> 02:10:22,338
Thank you..

2214
02:10:23,549 --> 02:10:25,210
-Would you embarrass me?-Sorry!

2215

l'll divorce you today itself

2216
02:10:28,220 --> 02:10:29,744
lsn't there a limit to stupidity?

2217
02:10:30,422 --> 02:10:38,522
Crying?? Smile

2218
02:10:39,431 --> 02:10:40,898

My dad said to give Rs.500.00

2222
02:10:46,405 --> 02:10:49,203
Helloo.. at your marriage l had given Rs.1000.00

2223
02:10:49,408 --> 02:10:51,205
So then you should give at least Rs.1500.00

2224
02:10:51,410 --> 02:10:53,173
Press.. Press Man. Press on the amount..

2225
02:10:54,613 --> 02:10:56,740
Your Dad is like that. Come on swipe

-Pressed..-Ok .

Now give this to your dad...

2229
02:11:06,225 --> 02:11:08,819
ln fact we developed the best app anyways....

2230
02:11:09,561 --> 02:11:11,825
lt was this professor who gave him
the idea of this App.

2231
02:11:12,431 --> 02:11:15,264
Actually the professor is the right person
to put spokes in the wheels

2232
02:11:16,401 --> 02:11:19,199
Man at least acknowledge for the good work
extended..

2233
02:11:20,806 --> 02:11:23,536
lt was Sir who arranged for the
Make-in-lndia loan for him

2234
02:11:24,643 --> 02:11:26,406
Even if Sir was not their l would have got it..

2235
02:11:32,217 --> 02:11:34,742
Ha.. Ha...

2236
02:11:35,687 --> 02:11:38,178
-Sir, Saar..-Sorry

02:11:38,490 --> 02:11:40,458

-Towards there-Yes..

02:11:45,397 --> 02:11:46,625
You also stand a little towards there..

2241
02:11:47,566 --> 02:11:48,498
Stand aside...
