1
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:23,684
Good & Bad is within
not outside.

2
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:30,775
<i>Here lies a song...</i>

3
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:41,646
<i>... sea is waiting to</i>
<i>compose the tune,</i>

4
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:50,598
<i>... waiting to narrate a story,</i>

5
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,367
<i>... expecting someone's arrival.</i>

6
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,503
<i>Is it ground to breed poetry?</i>

7
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:07,610
<i>Is it the face of love?</i>

8
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:12,981
<i>Is it the heart beat?</i>

9
00:06:13,389 --> 00:06:18,486
<i>Is it translation of epics?</i>

10
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:23,858
<i>What do you call it?</i>

11
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,963
<i>And who will explain it?</i>

12
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:35,176
<i>What do you call it?</i>

13
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:39,940
<i>And who will explain it?</i>

14
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:50,815
He is trying to empty the sea

15
00:06:55,198 --> 00:06:58,497
Chennai

16
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:03,904
Hi! Good morning sir.

17
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,334
I'm candidate No. 11

18
00:07:05,575 --> 00:07:06,166
And my name is Kamban.

19
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:09,576
Won't you tell me to sit?

20
00:07:09,812 --> 00:07:11,109
Please. - Thank you.

21
00:07:14,917 --> 00:07:15,645
Your father's name?

22
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:19,253
I don't know.

23
00:07:22,658 --> 00:07:25,889
He's Valluvanar's son. - Little arrogant.

24
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:27,956
I'm not arrogant.
That's my style.

25
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:28,956
Kamban's style.

26
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:32,032
Tell us the 12th verse of Thirukkural.

27
00:07:32,502 --> 00:07:33,594
12th verse?

28
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,903
For all help... pistol

29
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:41,610
Stop.

30
00:07:44,113 --> 00:07:45,978
What did you do in the interview?

31
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,417
They asked me your name.

32
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,976
And I said "I don't know".

33
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:52,417
Vasuki, heard what he said?

34
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:54,781
Useless fellow!

35
00:07:55,758 --> 00:07:57,316
Fit for nothing.

36
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,857
You don't like me to mention
your name "Valuvanar".

37
00:08:02,331 --> 00:08:06,233
It's "Valluvanar" & not "Valuvanar"

38
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:07,693
You're right.

39
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:10,362
How can you pronounce
your father's name wrong?

40
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,602
Children bring glory to parents.

41
00:08:13,042 --> 00:08:15,067
But he is not even able to pronounce
my name properly.

42
00:08:15,645 --> 00:08:16,236
Sorry mom.

43
00:08:16,712 --> 00:08:18,680
I'm unable to pronounce it properly.

44
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:21,342
Let him change his name instead.

45
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,347
Valvanar" Sounds stylish!

46
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:24,911
If you can't pronounce 'Lla' properly,

47
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,315
should everyone change their names?

48
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,547
Didn't mother change her name
to Vasuki for your sake?

49
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:31,224
Useless bottle cap!

50
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:38,695
Valuvanar, I'm like curry leaves.

51
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:42,296
You enjoy the drink but
throw away the cap.

52
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:43,061
Son please...

53
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,297
He many soda he drinks on the stage.

54
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:48,106
He can't speak a word without it.

55
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:51,070
Tamil is beautiful language.
- I never denied that.

56
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,377
Shouldn't speak wrongly? - But I can't.

57
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,084
La, Lla, Ra letters must
be pronounced right,

58
00:08:58,354 --> 00:09:00,379
Keep warning about
this to your tongue.

59
00:09:00,823 --> 00:09:01,380
Wonderful!

60
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,853
Poet Vaali wrote this.

61
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,251
He wrote it because he can
pronounce it right.

62
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:05,185
But I can't.

63
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,961
I can show you any number of people
who can't pronounce it properly.

64
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:15,560
This is Vadapalani temple sacred ash.

65
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:17,801
Apply little.

66
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:23,637
Many apply it big to cover
their bald heads.

67
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,541
Stop talking nonsense.

68
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:30,412
Which God will be my saviour today?

69
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,383
Who should I pray?

70
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,928
Meet Lord Murugan.
He is your saviour. - Is it?

71
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:51,434
1... 2... 3...

72
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,368
My mom is the best.

73
00:09:54,076 --> 00:10:00,743
Great mom and son.
You're bribing him to buy affection.

74
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,482
Why don't you try that?

75
00:10:03,786 --> 00:10:05,583
Look, he asking me to
follow your foot steps.

76
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,189
To every child,
father is nothing but a bank.

77
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:13,887
It's law of nature.

78
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:19,434
There is a vacancy in
Jeevan Software Company.

79
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:22,771
I have the requisite qualification.

80
00:10:22,972 --> 00:10:23,939
If you could recommend...

81
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:27,569
You are knocking the wrong doors.

82
00:10:28,344 --> 00:10:30,005
Is my father's door the wrong door?

83
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:33,741
I hate recommendations.

84
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,710
Can't you atleast do this for your son?

85
00:10:35,918 --> 00:10:38,409
No compromise for son also.
That's my principle.

86
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:40,646
What bloody principle?

87
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:43,053
You must find a job by yourself.

88
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:45,624
Please keep quiet.
- Don't be a politician at home also.

89
00:10:46,128 --> 00:10:46,958
Be a father.

90
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:49,696
A word of recommendation
isn't stooping down.

91
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,296
No one will appoint an inquiry
committee for that. - Dear...

92
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:54,560
No one will take you to the
court for that. - Please...

93
00:10:55,371 --> 00:10:57,134
People are making billions...

94
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:01,304
A recommendation will not seek your head.
- Please mind your words.

95
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:02,043
Just look at him sitting unmoved.

96
00:11:02,611 --> 00:11:06,069
I'm getting angry. - You shouldn't.

97
00:11:06,282 --> 00:11:06,839
But I'm getting angry.

98
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:09,150
Chant god's name whenever you get angry.

99
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:10,374
Atleast then you will reform.

100
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,551
My anger on him will never subside even
if I chant billions of god's name.

101
00:11:21,664 --> 00:11:23,996
You guard this Valuvanar.

102
00:11:25,234 --> 00:11:30,001
Who guards the 133 feet Valluvanar's
statue at Cape Comorin?

103
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:32,469
I will tell you.

104
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,307
He can take care of himself.

105
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:36,269
He saved himself from Tsunami, didn't he?

106
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:37,641
Come home soon.

107
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,040
While coming home, bring me the book
"Avatharapurushan" by Vaali.

108
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,285
I can't believe it.
- What do you mean?

109
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,920
Hey... save me... save me...

110
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,331
Take all the necessary legal actions.

111
00:12:00,102 --> 00:12:01,069
Yes, this is Valluvanar's speaking.

112
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:02,935
Do as I say.

113
00:12:05,074 --> 00:12:08,043
Who were you talking to?

114
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:13,906
Your pampered son has killed a man...
...riding on the bike.

115
00:12:14,884 --> 00:12:15,816
He is now in the police station.

116
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,077
Oh God! Police station!?

117
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:22,522
Valluvanar has refused
to bail you out.

118
00:12:23,092 --> 00:12:24,491
And asked us to take all
necessary legal actions.

119
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,524
I've no choice but to arrest you.

120
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,791
Inspector... - Greetings sir.

121
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,424
I'll bail him out.

122
00:12:34,804 --> 00:12:35,429
Who are you?

123
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,237
How could you be so heartless?

124
00:12:40,643 --> 00:12:43,578
My dear son, how did you come out?

125
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:46,407
Can't I come out without his help?

126
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,207
Aren't there other big shots
in the country?

127
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,078
Even I know a few.

128
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,786
I also know politics.

129
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:52,985
Don't get angry.

130
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,346
Every action of your father
will always be just.

131
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:56,081
What justice?

132
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,855
They would've released me
if he had told them.

133
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:02,394
Look, don't put price on my
honesty for your mistakes.

134
00:13:02,832 --> 00:13:03,856
I don't need to explain.

135
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,493
I wasn't riding the bike.
I was pillion rider.

136
00:13:06,902 --> 00:13:09,996
A drunken old man fell
before our moving bike.

137
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,498
And died in shock.

138
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:14,339
If not our bike, he would've fallen
under the bus behind us.

139
00:13:14,777 --> 00:13:15,505
And died.

140
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:18,475
No legal action can be taken on me.

141
00:13:19,748 --> 00:13:23,047
Down with Valluvanar!

142
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:28,217
You scoundrel! Let me go and...

143
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:29,652
Stop Vasuki. - What?

144
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,159
He's blackening the wall, right?
He's not blackening my face, right?

145
00:13:39,034 --> 00:13:41,594
You helped me what my father denied.

146
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:42,960
I came to thank you.

147
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:45,605
Kamban, I don't have sons.

148
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:50,077
If you are with me,
I would take you to great heights.

149
00:13:51,547 --> 00:13:52,809
I haven't met you till now.

150
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:55,175
So high regard for me?

151
00:14:01,657 --> 00:14:02,385
What should I do?

152
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:05,222
Bring the sweets.

153
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:13,932
He has joined our party today.

154
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:14,761
He is Mr. Kamban.

155
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,301
I don't need to tell you about him.

156
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:20,835
It's a honour to have him in our party.

157
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:23,302
<i>Our party is honoured with his arrival.</i>

158
00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:24,409
<i>Long live Kamban!</i>

159
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:29,546
Valluvanar's son Kamban joins
opposition People's progressive party

160
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:39,221
Sir, Deputy leader of our party...

161
00:14:40,896 --> 00:14:42,090
And one more thing,

162
00:14:42,932 --> 00:14:45,298
and he wishes to say
"He will drive out Valluvanar from politics".

163
00:14:45,734 --> 00:14:47,326
I will drive out Valluvanar from politics"
a son's challenge.

164
00:14:55,945 --> 00:14:56,639
Come here.

165
00:14:57,112 --> 00:14:57,976
How dare you do this?

166
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:00,006
Was I wrong?

167
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:03,582
No, it is not wrong. No.

168
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,246
Who said it's wrong?

169
00:15:09,858 --> 00:15:11,792
Are you watching a show?
Get lost.

170
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:17,529
Why do you want to join politics?

171
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,625
Politics is in my genes.

172
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:24,168
If you had listened to your father,

173
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,633
you could've got a better
post in his party, right?

174
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,471
People will accuse him
of Heir politics.

175
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,411
That's why I joined opposition party.

176
00:15:39,221 --> 00:15:41,212
Go out & come later.

177
00:15:41,724 --> 00:15:42,656
Don't meet your father.

178
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:46,586
<i>Stop.</i>

179
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:53,191
It's not right for both of us
to live in the same house.

180
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,933
Are you asking me to leave the house?

181
00:15:58,641 --> 00:15:59,300
No my son.

182
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,301
I know the law.

183
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:03,840
Grandson has the right on
grandfather's wealth.

184
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,648
You can stay at our house in Adyar.

185
00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:08,507
It's your wish now.

186
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:10,281
Catch the keys.

187
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:14,918
No god will give you pocket money.

188
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,786
But your father will... every month.

189
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,586
Presenting a shawl means,
they have cheated you.

190
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,694
Your father is a role model in politics.

191
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,427
People will spit at you.

192
00:16:55,631 --> 00:16:56,757
It's enough.

193
00:16:57,032 --> 00:16:58,465
Tell me what I should do now.

194
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,828
Whether you say something or don't,
it will be news.

195
00:17:01,203 --> 00:17:03,228
Do one thing. Escape to abroad.

196
00:17:03,672 --> 00:17:06,140
No partymen or the media will know this.

197
00:17:06,341 --> 00:17:08,275
You decide where you want to go.
Don't tell anyone.

198
00:17:10,245 --> 00:17:12,509
Mom, I will go to Srilanka.

199
00:17:12,981 --> 00:17:15,211
No visa problems.

200
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:18,011
Did you inform your father?

201
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:20,211
No. He shouldn't also know it.

202
00:17:20,656 --> 00:17:22,954
Let no one know my whereabouts
for sometime.

203
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:25,760
It's not proper to leave
without informing your father.

204
00:17:26,228 --> 00:17:27,058
Just 2 months.

205
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:29,588
I will call you on phone.

206
00:17:30,232 --> 00:17:31,859
Once everything calms down,
I will come back.

207
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:33,227
Okay.

208
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,364
But be honest wherever you may be.

209
00:17:36,739 --> 00:17:39,264
No wrong doings.
And never tell lies.

210
00:17:39,608 --> 00:17:40,666
Got it? - Okay.

211
00:17:40,876 --> 00:17:41,467
Excuse me...

212
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:52,145
Whenever you lie,
put money in this box.

213
00:17:52,888 --> 00:17:53,650
What is it?

214
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:54,882
You must put money in it.

215
00:17:57,593 --> 00:17:59,424
So, I can lie till it gets filled, ah?

216
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:05,128
If there is no money in this
when you come back,

217
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,057
I would be very happy.

218
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,829
I will call this landline number only.

219
00:18:12,241 --> 00:18:14,607
You can't trace me from this phone.

220
00:18:15,244 --> 00:18:16,336
Okay come.

221
00:18:22,785 --> 00:18:23,877
You are going to Srilanka.

222
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,588
Don't stay near the beach.

223
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:30,585
Mummy, you are the best.

224
00:18:31,393 --> 00:18:33,190
Colombo

225
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,864
Wow! Beautiful sari.

226
00:18:48,477 --> 00:18:49,842
Your sari is very beautiful.

227
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:50,841
Where did you buy it?

228
00:18:51,146 --> 00:18:52,010
I don't know.

229
00:18:52,247 --> 00:18:53,771
It's a gift from my sister-in-law.

230
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,139
Hi!

231
00:18:56,185 --> 00:18:57,618
What do you mean by it?

232
00:18:58,287 --> 00:19:01,745
It's a kind of knife.
It will kill you.

233
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,230
The flight from Bombay started late.

234
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,560
No wonder.

235
00:19:11,033 --> 00:19:11,829
That's why I'm late.

236
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:14,500
Hi! Vishnu. - Hi!

237
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,635
Hello. - How are you?

238
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:17,897
I'm good. - I miss you so much.

239
00:19:18,106 --> 00:19:18,663
Bye.

240
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:19,772
She is very beautiful.

241
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:20,873
Meenu... - Aunty.

242
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:21,901
Hi!

243
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,941
You should've come in the Chennai flight.
Where were you till now?

244
00:19:26,348 --> 00:19:27,178
Inside duty room.

245
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:29,080
Who was the Air hostess?

246
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,216
Bangalore or Bombay?

247
00:19:30,552 --> 00:19:31,246
Bangalore.

248
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:34,118
Sister-in-law, I've come from Bombay.

249
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:36,220
You haven't invited me.
But very busy inquiring him.

250
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:38,189
Okay. Welcome. How do you do?

251
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:41,322
Inquiry is not enough.
I must scan your brother.

252
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,622
He is a cheat to the core.

253
00:19:57,379 --> 00:19:58,710
She's absent minded.

254
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,144
Have coffee.

255
00:20:09,091 --> 00:20:11,184
Oh God! What's this?

256
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:16,795
You've come here to study and
achieve something without marrying.

257
00:20:17,165 --> 00:20:19,224
You've a graffiti of no lazy talk,

258
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:20,731
but you're reading a gossip magazine.

259
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:21,561
What's this?

260
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:26,230
When there's nothing for knowledge,
we'll get attracted to gossip.

261
00:20:26,842 --> 00:20:32,474
I hope it doesn't become vice versa.

262
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:34,312
You haven't understood me.

263
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,910
I've understood you very well.

264
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:38,245
You're a hypocrite... hypocrite.

265
00:20:43,692 --> 00:20:45,159
Phone is ringing in the downstairs.

266
00:20:48,764 --> 00:20:49,992
Shall I pick it up?

267
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:54,096
No, it may be my son,
I'll take it, you can go.

268
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,860
Son... son... how are you?

269
00:21:22,064 --> 00:21:25,033
I met my childhood friend
by chance in the airport,

270
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:28,768
I couldn't recognise him,
but he recognised me.

271
00:21:29,404 --> 00:21:32,532
He insisted on visiting his home.

272
00:21:34,176 --> 00:21:35,040
What's that charity box?

273
00:21:35,243 --> 00:21:36,540
Shut up.

274
00:21:37,746 --> 00:21:40,544
I was worried about your
welfare and lodging.

275
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:43,551
Lord Murugan will help you.

276
00:21:43,752 --> 00:21:47,552
I lied that I'm a tourist not
here to escape from problems.

277
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:50,050
I donated the lie money
in the charity box.

278
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:54,228
Do you really love me?

279
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:58,155
<i>Do you really love me?</i>

280
00:22:00,602 --> 00:22:01,899
Do you really love me?

281
00:22:02,104 --> 00:22:03,731
Who are you?
What do you want?

282
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:04,572
What do you want?

283
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:05,398
What do I want?

284
00:22:05,707 --> 00:22:07,072
I want a friend immediately.

285
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:09,671
You're asking a friend
like borrowing money.

286
00:22:09,945 --> 00:22:10,741
Comedy.

287
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,405
My name is Banerjee,
I'm a Bengali.

288
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:16,082
I stared at feet and grew up to
reach head in my profession.

289
00:22:16,284 --> 00:22:20,084
I was polishing boots earlier,
now I'm a hair stylist.

290
00:22:20,288 --> 00:22:22,256
You mean Bengali, very good.

291
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,148
I love Bengali.

292
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,257
You know Bengali?

293
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:25,926
Very well.

294
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:27,254
Come on speak.

295
00:22:27,529 --> 00:22:29,759
Thou art the ruler of the
minds of all people,

296
00:22:29,965 --> 00:22:31,432
dispenser of India's destiny.

297
00:22:31,633 --> 00:22:33,692
Thy name rouses the hearts of Punjab,
Sindh, Gujarat, the Maratha country,

298
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:36,828
What's your name friend?

299
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,270
Her name is... Bharathi from Chennai.

300
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:41,601
Where are you put up?

301
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:42,605
In your house.

302
00:22:44,646 --> 00:22:45,772
I need a place to stay.

303
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:46,948
For that I need a friend.

304
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:51,114
You laugh just like my friend.

305
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:52,281
Who is your friend?

306
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:53,454
It's you Banner!

307
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:56,385
Banner? Say Banerjee.

308
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:58,951
Jee means Hindi, we don't know.

309
00:22:59,161 --> 00:22:59,957
Banner is good.

310
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:01,962
You must know all languages.

311
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,629
I know two languages.

312
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,459
I can say No in eight languages.

313
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,134
I can laugh in eighteen languages.

314
00:23:10,005 --> 00:23:11,973
I want your help.

315
00:23:12,674 --> 00:23:13,641
Go ahead, Banner.

316
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:14,968
Read love letters.

317
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:16,301
Tamil love letters.

318
00:23:17,179 --> 00:23:18,874
She's from Nuwara Eliya.

319
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:23,817
She writes letter... what do you say?
Writes love letters in Tamil.

320
00:23:24,586 --> 00:23:26,315
I don't know to read Tamil.

321
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:29,656
I write love letters to her in Bengali.

322
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:32,485
She doesn't know to read Bengali.

323
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:34,386
This is our problem.

324
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:35,494
Got a mail!

325
00:23:35,697 --> 00:23:39,497
Brother... a letter...
read it for me, friend.

326
00:23:39,968 --> 00:23:41,993
No Banner, it's not good to
read others' letters.

327
00:23:42,204 --> 00:23:45,503
Just one sentence... read my friend.

328
00:23:49,811 --> 00:23:53,372
Meeting you is like seeing
a flower in autumn season.

329
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:56,377
What a creative poetic mind she has!

330
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:57,176
Thank you.

331
00:23:58,553 --> 00:23:59,247
What is her name?

332
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,352
Vasuki.

333
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:07,191
My mother's name is also Vasuki.

334
00:24:07,562 --> 00:24:08,688
This is my father.

335
00:24:09,231 --> 00:24:11,461
He's a man of gold.

336
00:24:12,067 --> 00:24:13,364
What does your father do?

337
00:24:15,137 --> 00:24:16,604
I don't want to talk about him.

338
00:24:17,072 --> 00:24:17,538
Poor man.

339
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:20,535
Is he a bad man? Immoral?

340
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:22,805
Sorry dad.

341
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:27,480
He's a different father
with a strange name.

342
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:35,317
He's native of Tirunelveli.

343
00:24:36,758 --> 00:24:37,816
Villager to the core.

344
00:24:38,927 --> 00:24:41,953
His name is Theeppori.

345
00:24:42,264 --> 00:24:43,162
Theeppori?

346
00:24:45,433 --> 00:24:47,731
Short tempered man.

347
00:24:50,338 --> 00:24:51,669
A man with fiery looks.

348
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:57,740
Always starts with bad words.

349
00:24:58,446 --> 00:24:59,242
Foul mouthed man.

350
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:06,918
Such a father! I can't even imagine.

351
00:25:08,456 --> 00:25:09,753
Hi Helen! How are you?

352
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,652
Who is she? Who is Helen?

353
00:25:12,294 --> 00:25:15,092
I'll talk to you later.
Helen is the name of a race horse.

354
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:16,423
You want me to believe it.

355
00:25:17,332 --> 00:25:19,926
But the same horse called on
phone today morning also.

356
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:21,769
Crook! Who is that horse?

357
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:25,940
Women fall for this sweet smile.

358
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:27,771
Tell me, who is she?

359
00:25:27,976 --> 00:25:29,341
My co-pilot's sister.

360
00:25:29,711 --> 00:25:30,769
Why is she calling you on phone?

361
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:31,775
Just like that.

362
00:25:32,314 --> 00:25:34,441
What did you ask her?
- I asked, how are you?

363
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,280
Is she pregnant to ask that?

364
00:25:37,485 --> 00:25:37,951
Which month is going on?

365
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:40,018
Should I ask how are you
only if she's pregnant?

366
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:42,623
How is the Bombay horse?

367
00:25:42,824 --> 00:25:43,620
She's pregnant now.

368
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:44,792
Which month is going on?

369
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:46,790
May be third month,
but why are you asking me all this?

370
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:49,954
You know all the details correctly, crook.

371
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:52,133
Her husband told me when I called
him on phone last week.

372
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,899
Did he tell it himself or
you asked him the details?

373
00:25:54,102 --> 00:25:55,296
Why did you ask about her then?

374
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:57,471
He told me everything when
we were talking casually.

375
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,970
Shouldn't you stop him from
telling all those details?

376
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:02,973
Stop it my mother.

377
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:05,578
You don't use this word 'mother'
for other women.

378
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:09,816
Bangalore lady, Mumbai lady,
when they're missing their dates,

379
00:26:10,018 --> 00:26:10,643
you've all the details on finger tips.

380
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:12,979
Why are you behaving like Geeta in the
Tamil film 'Pudhu Pudhu Arthangal'?

381
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:15,816
If I don't you'll become like Kamalahasan
in Tamil film ' Manmadhaleelai'.

382
00:26:16,424 --> 00:26:17,482
Stop it!

383
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:26,563
Come my son. Don't you know me?

384
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:30,068
Why are you surprised like
a thief caught red handed?

385
00:26:30,372 --> 00:26:32,169
Who are you?
- Bloody, you call me daddy.

386
00:26:32,374 --> 00:26:33,671
Asking me, who am I?

387
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:36,077
My father is Valluvanar.

388
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,505
Don't I know your father is Valluvanar?

389
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,005
You created a father for your sake.

390
00:26:42,284 --> 00:26:43,273
Just a while ago.

391
00:26:43,485 --> 00:26:44,349
You imagined.

392
00:26:48,223 --> 00:26:52,353
I've come like the same father, you fool.

393
00:26:52,727 --> 00:26:55,355
I lied to Banner to manage him,

394
00:26:55,563 --> 00:26:56,962
you're a lie in flesh and blood.

395
00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:59,923
I'm not your lie's personification,
you wastrel.

396
00:27:00,635 --> 00:27:02,193
I'm the form of your creation.

397
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:04,529
What's this man?
You use bad words too often.

398
00:27:04,906 --> 00:27:09,036
You told him that your father
is a foul mouthed man.

399
00:27:09,244 --> 00:27:12,372
Do you feel like worshipping
your real father as a god?

400
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,205
Useless man.

401
00:27:13,581 --> 00:27:15,708
That's okay,
why are you disturbing me now?

402
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:19,649
I'm going to reform you into
a fine young man.

403
00:27:19,988 --> 00:27:20,886
What are you going to do with me?

404
00:27:21,089 --> 00:27:23,216
Bloody, you've given me
a full time tough job.

405
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:31,731
Look, don't be a mother's son,
fall in love with a good girl,

406
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,394
a young beautiful girl.

407
00:27:33,601 --> 00:27:35,228
Love? I don't know.

408
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:36,570
I know it very well.

409
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:37,567
I'll teach you.

410
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:39,732
Love doesn't suit me.

411
00:27:39,941 --> 00:27:42,466
Get lost boy. No use of your living.

412
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:45,908
You don't need anything else
if you've love.

413
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:48,575
No use of having anything
if you don't have love.

414
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:49,416
Theeppori!

415
00:27:49,617 --> 00:27:51,244
Call me dad, son!

416
00:27:51,886 --> 00:27:53,080
Okay, dad!

417
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:57,150
If you fall in love,
you'll become a new man.

418
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,159
Your toughness, foolishness, craziness,
proudness, everything will change.

419
00:28:01,529 --> 00:28:02,826
Will you listen to me?

420
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:08,263
If you want to succeed in love,
there are 10 rules, shall I tell you?

421
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:10,701
Okay, tell me.

422
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:11,599
Start counting.

423
00:28:11,806 --> 00:28:12,932
Throw brain into the dust bin.

424
00:28:13,208 --> 00:28:14,038
Break the clock.

425
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:16,103
Find her younger sisters or brothers.

426
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:18,605
Chase them and smile sheepishly at them.

427
00:28:19,147 --> 00:28:20,614
She'll call you a wastrel, bear it.

428
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:22,707
If she beats with slippers, count it.

429
00:28:23,051 --> 00:28:24,279
Scribble poems.

430
00:28:24,753 --> 00:28:26,721
Sport a beard... do penance.

431
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:29,456
If she asks you to do sit ups,
make it a habit.

432
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:32,054
Die a slow death and
come back alive.

433
00:28:32,861 --> 00:28:34,954
Na. Muthukumaraswami Siddhar told this.

434
00:28:35,163 --> 00:28:36,289
Come on repeat now.

435
00:28:36,498 --> 00:28:37,624
Do I've to do all this for love?

436
00:28:39,567 --> 00:28:40,625
There's much more to do.

437
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:43,736
You'll go crazy if I tell you
everything in one day.

00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,514
No I don't want.

472
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:25,018
It's flowers blessed by the Cupid,
please buy it, brother.

473
00:32:25,226 --> 00:32:27,694
I said no, why are you disturbing me?
Go away.

474
00:32:30,131 --> 00:32:33,692
A Tamil not helping another Tamil,
why were you born as Tamil?

475
00:32:34,068 --> 00:32:35,865
What? What did you say?

476
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:40,537
Why was I born? - Beat me.

477
00:32:40,908 --> 00:32:43,035
I've become insensitive getting
beaten up always.

478
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:45,542
Beat me... beat me...
this is nothing.

479
00:32:46,014 --> 00:32:49,040
Mother Mary! Forgive him... little boy.

480
00:32:49,584 --> 00:32:51,211
What? Little boy?

481
00:32:53,154 --> 00:32:53,711
I'll kill you, rascal.

482
00:32:53,921 --> 00:32:55,479
Brother, don't beat him.
- Who do you think I'm?

483
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:58,056
Don't beat him, poor man was
affected by Tsunami.

484
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:02,119
He owned a large flower shop,
and a musical instruments shop also,

485
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,788
he lost shops, entire family,
everything he had in Tsunami.

486
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,558
He lost his balance now.

487
00:33:08,703 --> 00:33:10,136
A Tamil who was born to rule...

488
00:33:10,605 --> 00:33:12,402
...is now picking up flowers.

489
00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:19,747
Do you know about hot flowers?

490
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:24,743
Hot flowers!

491
00:33:44,972 --> 00:33:45,768
Sorry brother.

492
00:33:48,142 --> 00:33:49,439
Saying sorry to me.

493
00:33:50,912 --> 00:33:55,611
Just like the Americans who drop a bomb
and then say sorry.

494
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,447

Shilpa!

501
00:35:06,721 --> 00:35:10,020
She has arrested love in a circle.

502
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:13,186
May be she doesn't like love?

503
00:35:13,394 --> 00:35:15,021
Why do you always think negatively?

504
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:16,695
I like the girl very much.

505
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:22,028
Shilpa... what sort of a name?
It isn't a Tamil girl's name.

506
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,596
Will she be a North Indian?

507
00:35:24,505 --> 00:35:27,201
She's reading 'Kallikattu Ithihasam',
she must be a Tamil girl.

508
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:30,134
She has taste for literature
like my mother.

509
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:32,813
Her handwriting,
the books she reads,

510
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,981
the pigeon feather in it,
I like everything.

511
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:39,153
<i>Okay, start searching for her.</i>
<i>Start with Lord Ganesha.</i>

512
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,329
Lord Ganesha! Who is that Shilpa?
Show her to me.

513
00:36:00,842 --> 00:36:02,070
You must bless me.

514
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,508
I should've dropped it
somewhere here only.

515
00:36:10,151 --> 00:36:13,643
I'll force you to tie the knot,
everything will be fine.

516
00:36:18,392 --> 00:36:20,326
Great girl for tying the knot.

517
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:26,425
Oh! It's here!

518
00:36:28,402 --> 00:36:29,334
Thank God.

519
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:31,772
Hi Shilpa!

520
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:34,942
My name isn't Shilpa.

521
00:36:35,343 --> 00:36:37,004
That's Shilpa's book, keep it there.

522
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:39,044
She's my cousin sister.

523
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,444
Then your name?

524
00:36:41,048 --> 00:36:41,946
Why do you want to know?

525
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:43,213
Hey girl!

526
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:48,782
You can't take the book
without telling your name.

527
00:36:50,157 --> 00:36:51,124
Is it?

528
00:36:53,327 --> 00:36:56,353
If you know my true identity,
you'll run for life.

529
00:36:56,831 --> 00:36:57,456
Who are you?

530
00:36:58,666 --> 00:37:01,635
Do you know the man on
the book's cover page?

531
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:05,366
He? I think he's a powerful
politician in Tamil Nadu.

532
00:37:06,941 --> 00:37:07,566
Valluvanar.

533
00:37:08,342 --> 00:37:09,468
I'm his only daughter.

534
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:12,042
What? His daughter?

535
00:37:12,446 --> 00:37:13,208
Lord Murugan.

536
00:37:15,116 --> 00:37:17,141
Got scared? Mind your business.

537
00:37:17,351 --> 00:37:20,047
Hello! You don't know about me.

538
00:37:20,688 --> 00:37:24,055
I'm not a normal young man,
I'm off beat young man.

539
00:37:24,258 --> 00:37:26,385
My path is royal path.

540
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:28,486
Okay, what if?

541
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:30,754
But one thing,
I'll say before I forget it.

542
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:35,324
Seeing you is like a flower
blooming in autumn.

543
00:37:35,536 --> 00:37:39,165
Bloody idiot! Can't you say a
sentence of love on your own?

544
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:41,436
He's a copycat.

545
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:42,336
Excuse me.

546
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:45,742
Not even a thanks.

547
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,775
Hey autumn flower!

548
00:37:56,390 --> 00:37:58,517
I know... you are Shilpa.

549
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:10,298
Meenu darling, there's a man
standing in the front yard,

550
00:38:10,571 --> 00:38:11,538
he's staring here only,

551
00:38:11,772 --> 00:38:12,704
see if he's gone.

552
00:38:18,312 --> 00:38:21,042
Wearing black pant and
white shirt, right?

553
00:38:22,249 --> 00:38:23,716
He's still here only.

554
00:38:33,661 --> 00:38:38,394
<i>I found...</i>

555
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:43,400
<i>I found...</i>

556
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:44,662
<i>I found...</i>

557
00:38:44,872 --> 00:38:45,896
<i>I found...</i>

558
00:38:46,107 --> 00:38:48,405
<i>I found the Island of Virgin...</i>

559
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:50,839
<i>I found... I found...</i>

560
00:38:51,045 --> 00:38:53,343
<i>I found the Island of Virgin...</i>

561
00:38:53,614 --> 00:38:57,914
<i>How long... how long... how long...</i>

562
00:38:58,452 --> 00:39:00,920
<i>I was swimming on hard ground...</i>

563
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:03,249
<i>I was drinking water from the river Love...</i>

564
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:05,755
<i>Caught fish in pouring rain...</i>

565
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,258
<i>Searched for years</i>
<i>in Kolar gold fields...</i>

566
00:39:08,462 --> 00:39:10,760
<i>Roamed all around for</i>
<i>her like blowing breeze...</i>

567
00:39:10,965 --> 00:39:13,092
<i>I'll take the juice of young</i>
<i>virgin tender tea leaves...</i>

568
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,598
<i>I measured the Isles of Katcha</i>
<i>with my legs...</i>

569
00:39:15,803 --> 00:39:18,101
<i>I measured rest of it with my eyes...</i>

570
00:39:18,305 --> 00:39:23,038
<i>Drowned like Sethusamudram</i>
<i>and raised like phoenix...</i>

571
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:25,610
<i>I opened the earth but</i>
<i>she isn't there also...</i>

572
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:28,043
<i>She's not in Buddha Vihara too...</i>

573
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:30,444
<i>I opened the sea,</i>
<i>she wasn't there also...</i>

574
00:39:30,651 --> 00:39:32,949
<i>I didn't find any trace of her...</i>

575
00:39:33,154 --> 00:39:35,452
<i>Vanished somewhere...</i>
<i>Searched elsewhere...</i>

576
00:39:35,656 --> 00:39:37,954
<i>I saw my Seetha in Sri Lanka...</i>

577
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:47,192
<i>I found... I found...</i>
<i>I found... I found...</i>

578
00:39:48,002 --> 00:39:52,302
<i>I found the Island of Virgin...</i>

579
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,305
<i>Her fiery eyes slapped me hardly...</i>

580
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:57,807
<i>Her laser sharp eyes hurt my cheeks...</i>

581
00:39:58,012 --> 00:40:00,310
<i>My youth was in pain...</i>

582
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:02,641
<i>A heart wished for law of ban...</i>

583
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:06,650
<i>I found...</i>

584
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:11,988
<i>I found the Island of Virgin...</i>

585
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:22,828
<i>I found... I found...</i>

586
00:40:28,876 --> 00:40:34,508
<i>Seeing you is like a flower</i>
<i>blooming in autumn...</i>

587
00:41:05,312 --> 00:41:06,711
Meenu darling!

588
00:41:07,848 --> 00:41:08,712
What's it aunty?

589
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:12,213
Will you do me a favour? - What?

590
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,955
You must ask me,
why I've come to Colombo? - Why?

591
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:17,056
Ask me.

592
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:20,227
Why did you come to Colombo? - To study.

593
00:41:21,495 --> 00:41:24,055
Ask me this question often.

594
00:41:24,431 --> 00:41:25,557
Come ask me again.

595
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,462
Why did you come to Colombo?

596
00:41:28,202 --> 00:41:29,396
To study only.

597
00:41:30,104 --> 00:41:31,401
Then go and study.

598
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,237
Twinkle... twinkle...
tring... tring... tring.

599
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:40,743
Can you hear the little...

600
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,249
Hi uncle!

601
00:41:44,451 --> 00:41:45,645
Hi dear!

602
00:41:47,354 --> 00:41:48,412
Bye... bye.

603
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:09,540
How could you come dancing
pouring tea in your pocket?

604
00:42:09,743 --> 00:42:11,608
There's no tea mark on your shirt.

605
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,106
That's a trick.

606
00:42:14,481 --> 00:42:15,379
Watch now.

607
00:42:18,152 --> 00:42:19,619
See... see...

608
00:42:26,994 --> 00:42:28,461
Are you magic uncle?

609
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:29,458
Didn't you recognise me?

610
00:42:29,763 --> 00:42:32,789
I know. You came to our house that day.

611
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:34,065
Who are you?

612
00:42:34,668 --> 00:42:36,693
Sister... sister!

613
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:40,470
What's this falling at my feet
on the road? Get up.

614
00:42:40,674 --> 00:42:42,642
Bless me, only then I'll get up.

615
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:44,310
Get up... get up.

616
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:47,646
Can't a Tamil sister
bless a Tamil brother?

617
00:42:47,848 --> 00:42:48,473
Okay, may you be blessed with good life,

618
00:42:48,682 --> 00:42:50,149
come on get up now,
all are watching us.

619
00:42:50,351 --> 00:42:51,318
Thank you.

620
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,979
Give it to me, I'll carry it. - No, leave it.

621
00:42:55,189 --> 00:42:56,656
Leave it to me, I'll carry it.

622
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:59,485
Give it to me, come.

623
00:43:00,861 --> 00:43:01,657
Come.

624
00:43:02,429 --> 00:43:07,492
Dad, even ordinary things look
wonderful after meeting Shilpa.

625
00:43:07,701 --> 00:43:08,668
Didn't I tell you?

626
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:11,831
But how blatantly she lies.

627
00:43:12,039 --> 00:43:13,597
Is she telling it? It's her age.

628
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:16,503
I like it very much.

629
00:43:16,877 --> 00:43:18,071
You've also come to age.

630
00:43:19,213 --> 00:43:20,510
What's next, old man?

631
00:43:21,715 --> 00:43:22,943
Let lip touch lip.

632
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,345
Not good, we have met just now.

633
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,744
You're advising me to kiss her.

634
00:43:28,122 --> 00:43:31,853
Fool! Say a word that will unite two lips.

635
00:43:32,393 --> 00:43:35,692
Lie! Lie! Are lips uniting?

636
00:43:36,997 --> 00:43:38,191
You too tell lies.

637
00:43:38,465 --> 00:43:40,296
Lies are beauty to youth.

638
00:43:40,834 --> 00:43:45,703
For a just cause telling a lie
is also accepted as truth.

639
00:43:45,906 --> 00:43:47,874
You're a magician.

640
00:43:48,075 --> 00:43:49,042
A little.

641
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:55,042
For that don't use lies as main course,
use it like pickle.

642
00:43:57,117 --> 00:43:58,812
Will my son keep up my name?

643
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:12,226
Why are you crying now?

644
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,227
I was born in a remote village.

645
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:19,906
If a man sneezes,
entire village can hear it.

646
00:44:22,509 --> 00:44:26,741
My father is... a rogue.

647
00:44:27,114 --> 00:44:28,081
Beat me with slippers.

648
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:32,082
Making me a devil. Bloody idiot.

649
00:44:32,286 --> 00:44:35,744
What will a father do when his son
gets first rank in the class?

650
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:37,415
He'll be happy.

651
00:44:37,624 --> 00:44:39,489
He'll happy, won't he? - Certainly.

652
00:44:40,294 --> 00:44:42,762
But he...

653
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:46,763
Useless son!
You scored only 482 marks only.

654
00:44:46,967 --> 00:44:49,834
Where's the balance 18 marks to 500?
Did you miss 18 marks?

655
00:44:50,037 --> 00:44:52,267
Did you lose it?

656
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,268
I got first rank, dad.

657
00:44:54,475 --> 00:44:56,943
How can you get first rank? Bloody.

658
00:44:57,311 --> 00:45:01,941
If you miss 18 marks, it's 18th rank!

659
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:04,613
You'd know if you had studied.

660
00:45:04,818 --> 00:45:07,286
I'm sending you to school
because I never went to school,

661
00:45:07,488 --> 00:45:08,614
pointing it to me, you wastrel.

662
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:13,517
You never told me your name?

663
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:14,625
Enough Muruga.

664
00:45:14,995 --> 00:45:17,623
What's that name?
- My father had many sons.

665
00:45:17,831 --> 00:45:18,957
All had names of Murugan.

666
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:23,531
Murugan, Pazhani, Saravanan, Kandan,
Subramani, Shanmughan, Velan... etc.,

667
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:25,637
So many children?

668
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:29,468
So he named me as Enough Muruga.

669
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:33,879
I changed it to Bharathi, is it enough
if he names me as Enough Muruga?

670
00:45:34,348 --> 00:45:35,645
Shouldn't he keep quiet?

671
00:45:35,916 --> 00:45:37,144
Why? What did he do?

672
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:40,583
I had a little brother too.

673
00:45:41,422 --> 00:45:43,822
What did he name as?
- Not any more Muruga.

674
00:45:44,425 --> 00:45:46,757
Name? - Yes, it was his name.

675
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:47,892
Not any more Muruga.

676
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:49,492
How can a family hold so many?

677
00:45:49,963 --> 00:45:53,490
It was a dog's life... I had to go through
hell to finish studies.

678
00:45:54,368 --> 00:45:55,995
Life isn't rosy to everyone.

679
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:57,168
For instance take my life.

680
00:45:57,538 --> 00:46:00,439
I was born in a big family,
I had a luxurious life,

681
00:46:00,941 --> 00:46:01,566
but now?

682
00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:02,771
What happened?

683
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,673
If you marry a man at 50% discount dowry,
how will your life be with him?

684
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:08,678
Life is in dire straits.

685
00:46:09,383 --> 00:46:12,181
To tell you in short,
a wrong choice of husband.

686
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:18,350
What? Husband to you?

687
00:46:20,727 --> 00:46:22,251
What is this Lord?

688
00:46:22,496 --> 00:46:23,793
You wastrel!

689
00:46:24,064 --> 00:46:25,031
What am I to do now?

690
00:46:25,232 --> 00:46:26,130
Ask her to show Thali.

691
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:26,856
What if she shows it?

692
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,125
Ask to show her husband.

693
00:46:28,335 --> 00:46:29,199
What if she shows her husband also?

694
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:30,597
Ask what's her problem?

695
00:46:30,904 --> 00:46:33,600
Go boy, bombard her with questions.

696
00:46:33,907 --> 00:46:35,204
Break the fort of her lies.

697
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:38,537
Why are you lying to me? - Why?

698
00:46:38,745 --> 00:46:41,373
You say married but
you're not wearing Thali.

699
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:43,371
I removed it.

700
00:46:45,319 --> 00:46:47,719
What's this? Is it tradition?

701
00:46:48,489 --> 00:46:52,482
Whatever the problem may be,
can you remove the Thali?

702
00:46:53,427 --> 00:46:54,826
Isn't it against tradition?

703
00:46:55,429 --> 00:46:58,296
Why should I still wear Thali after
getting divorce from him?

704
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:09,835
Didn't expect me here?

705
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:12,908
Nonsense.

706
00:47:13,113 --> 00:47:17,140
Whatever the fight may be,
you could've discussed to settle issues.

707
00:47:17,351 --> 00:47:18,181
With your husband.

708
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:21,244
You shouldn't have stretched
it to divorce.

709
00:47:21,522 --> 00:47:23,752
How can I discuss with a dead man?

710
00:47:23,957 --> 00:47:24,423
Oh God!?

711
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:28,083
I'm a divorcee widow. Got it?

712
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:33,259
If you say yes, I've decided to
give you a new lease of life.

713
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:36,096
I've elders in family to decide that.

714
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:37,270
Mind your own business.

715
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,096
Bombed!

716
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:39,435
Sister!

717
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:41,337
What is this?

718
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:45,502
I was going through market,
I saw fresh and fleshy tomatoes.

719
00:47:45,712 --> 00:47:47,612
I brought 2 kgs for you.
- Thank you very much.

720
00:47:48,482 --> 00:47:50,006
Though you've so many maids in house,

721
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:53,720
you're doing all the work yourself,
that's great sister.

722
00:47:55,656 --> 00:47:59,023
When you laugh, you get a dimple
on cheek, that's also great.

723
00:48:00,561 --> 00:48:03,462
I don't sleep at nights
after hearing the news.

724
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:06,628
What's such a disturbing news?

725
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,634
I'm very angry on you sister.

726
00:48:09,169 --> 00:48:13,697
How can you be so happy with
a young widow in home?

727
00:48:13,941 --> 00:48:14,965
What? Widow?

728
00:48:15,175 --> 00:48:16,574
Who is it?

729
00:48:16,944 --> 00:48:18,639
Your sister-in-law Shilpa.

730
00:48:19,179 --> 00:48:21,374
Nonsense! Who told you she's a widow?

731
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:22,640
Shilpa herself.

732
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:25,380
She's not married yet.

733
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:28,081
How happy it is to hear this.

734
00:48:30,023 --> 00:48:31,490
She's here, look.

735
00:48:33,427 --> 00:48:36,396
You foolish girl, isn't there any
limit to your lies?

736
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,656
He was torturing me often,
so I lied to him.

737
00:48:39,866 --> 00:48:40,332
You...

738
00:48:40,534 --> 00:48:41,831
Please don't scold her.

739
00:48:42,035 --> 00:48:43,161
Will I fondle instead of scolding her?

740
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:44,496
Someone will come to do that.

741
00:48:45,205 --> 00:48:49,164
Foolish girl! Didn't you find
any other lie to tell?

742
00:48:49,376 --> 00:48:51,173
Will anyone say such inauspicious things?

743
00:48:51,878 --> 00:48:55,507
Have you gone mad? Brainless girl.

744
00:49:01,788 --> 00:49:02,755
Sorry.

745
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:08,084
Don't get angry for unmasking your lie.

746
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,097
But you lie blatantly.

747
00:49:22,909 --> 00:49:24,206
What are you looking at?

748
00:49:25,746 --> 00:49:27,441
You are very handsome.

749
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:30,209
Is it? Thank you.

750
00:49:30,951 --> 00:49:31,713
Thank you.

751
00:49:31,918 --> 00:49:33,886
How could you believe this as truth?

752
00:49:45,432 --> 00:49:49,892
For independent women who want
to achieve success in life,

753
00:49:51,605 --> 00:49:55,905
love and marriage are
like speed breakers.

754
00:49:58,945 --> 00:50:00,003
To pass my IAS exams.

755
00:50:02,883 --> 00:50:07,320
Reach the top level & serve people.

756
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,081
To make a mark in music.

757
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,724
To become a world famous writer.

758
00:50:18,398 --> 00:50:20,195
I had such ambitions.

759
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:28,875
But these remained as frozen dreams.

760
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:34,205
The reason was my love marriage.

761
00:50:36,216 --> 00:50:41,552
I don't mean to say that
I chose the wrong man.

762
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:47,588
But when I look back at my life,

763
00:50:49,229 --> 00:50:54,326
I'm unhappy for not able to
achieve anything in my life.

764
00:50:59,773 --> 00:51:04,608
I wanted to pour my feelings to you.

765
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:06,270
That's all.

766
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,740
I'm not trying to influence you.

767
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:14,878
I hate love & marriage.

768
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,013
Planning to become a Saint?

769
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:23,456
Love & marriage have stopped many women
from achieving their objective.

770
00:51:25,398 --> 00:51:30,028
Failures in love & marriage inspired many
women to achieve their objectives.

771
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:31,735
Let's quit this topic.

772
00:51:32,472 --> 00:51:35,134
I want to become a Kiran Bedi.
Got it?

773
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,033
I will pass my IAS exams.
Got it?

774
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:40,374
I'm here to study & achieve
my aim. Got it?

775
00:51:40,814 --> 00:51:43,044
I will never fall in love.

776
00:51:43,483 --> 00:51:45,815
I was also just like you.

777
00:51:46,653 --> 00:51:51,147
But I fell for your brother's
plastic smile & now suffering.

778
00:51:57,931 --> 00:51:59,899
Friend, do you remember me?

779
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:02,298
A Tamilian who gets beaten up always!

780
00:52:03,136 --> 00:52:04,569
Nice to meet you.

781
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,030
I'm Jesus Naidu.

782
00:52:08,341 --> 00:52:10,275
Jesus Naidu? - Flower seller.

783
00:52:11,578 --> 00:52:13,239
Do flowers need advertisement?

784
00:52:13,613 --> 00:52:14,671
Today is Valentine's day.

785
00:52:15,248 --> 00:52:15,805
Look there.

786
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:18,441
Lovers under the umbrella.

787
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:20,853
They try to evade us.

788
00:52:21,288 --> 00:52:23,313
On Valentine's day,
flowers sell like hot cakes.

789
00:52:25,926 --> 00:52:28,793
One common God to the entire world.

790
00:52:29,196 --> 00:52:32,791
That's Cupid, right?

791
00:52:36,603 --> 00:52:37,069
Hi!

792
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:38,702
Leech!

793
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,164
Why are you torturing me?

794
00:52:42,609 --> 00:52:43,200
Oh God!

795
00:52:43,810 --> 00:52:47,473
It's the love in you which is torturing
you & not me.

796
00:52:48,215 --> 00:52:50,240
There is no love. Got it?

797
00:52:51,117 --> 00:52:52,049
What do you want?

798
00:52:52,485 --> 00:52:54,385
You can't give it.

799
00:52:54,654 --> 00:52:57,282
I'm asking for the thing
which you can give.

800
00:52:57,657 --> 00:52:59,420
Just listen to what I'm saying.

801
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:01,656
You've been saying this
for the past 15 days.

802
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:02,822
And you're no different.

803
00:53:03,396 --> 00:53:04,727
I hate love.

804
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:06,089
I don't believe in love.

805
00:53:06,233 --> 00:53:07,894
I'm not interested in marriage.

806
00:53:08,068 --> 00:53:09,262
And there is no point in
coming after me.

807
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:09,935
Got it?

808
00:53:10,337 --> 00:53:12,669
You've been saying this
for the past 15 days.

809
00:53:13,106 --> 00:53:15,199
But still you don't understand
what I say.

810
00:53:15,408 --> 00:53:18,673
You will understand nothing
when you are in love.

811
00:53:19,579 --> 00:53:22,139
When life knocks your door,

812
00:53:22,349 --> 00:53:23,976
make sure you open it.

813
00:53:24,684 --> 00:53:26,515
If you don't, the life will be lost.

814
00:53:27,187 --> 00:53:31,180
If you think love is life,
then you are right. Got it?

815
00:53:32,225 --> 00:53:33,886
Let's chat for some more time and
then shift to another place.

816
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,523
You are a torture.

817
00:53:37,864 --> 00:53:39,024
Read this.

818
00:53:39,766 --> 00:53:40,892
What is it? A love letter?

819
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:43,097
Love letter is outdated style.

820
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:46,801
Nowadays, girls want updated
resume of boys. Peruse it.

821
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:48,907
Bharathi, please... try to understand me.

822
00:53:49,509 --> 00:53:51,977
I'm searching for myself inside me.

823
00:53:52,445 --> 00:53:54,504
You are not lost. I will find your real you.

824
00:53:55,448 --> 00:53:56,676
I need an identity.

825
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:59,883
Till then I... - Till then, look at this. Please.

826
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:05,313
Photo on the front page and
my bio-data on the back side.

827
00:54:06,293 --> 00:54:09,387
If you want moustache & beard,
I will grow it for you.

828
00:54:10,263 --> 00:54:12,288
Don't like my hair style,
I will shave my head clean.

829
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,524
If my jeans is not to the trend,
I will tear it.

830
00:54:14,734 --> 00:54:17,567
Cupid has started shooting
his arrows of love.

831
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:23,638
I've made it look very traditional.
It needs to be honoured.

832
00:54:24,444 --> 00:54:26,002
Lord Muruga...

833
00:54:27,447 --> 00:54:33,716
Hard face can break boulders!

834
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:35,788
My question to you is a very simple one.

835
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:39,486
Say YES or NO to my love.

836
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,285
Do not drag it.

837
00:54:44,397 --> 00:54:46,262
No. - Oh my God!

838
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,768
Impossible! - Oh my God!

839
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:51,794
No...

840
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:07,649
The sand you walked on is enough for me.

841
00:55:07,921 --> 00:55:09,479
Shameless!

842
00:55:09,923 --> 00:55:11,914
Applying sand on his forehead?!

843
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:13,087
Shameless!

844
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,152
He could've drank instead of that.

845
00:55:15,628 --> 00:55:16,560
Idiot!

846
00:55:18,531 --> 00:55:21,659
2. The game is over.

847
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,472
Who are you? Tell me.

848
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,017
Stop showing your back.

849
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:41,680
Do not behave like that stupid.

850
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,316
Tell me, who are you?

851
00:55:46,026 --> 00:55:48,756
You're caught in the game you started.

852
00:55:49,062 --> 00:55:52,361
Poking your nose in the
middle of the game!

853
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,429
What is your name?

854
00:55:54,134 --> 00:55:55,499
I've no separate name.

855
00:55:56,136 --> 00:55:59,196
People abuse me.

856
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:03,507
Oh God! Are you such a bad man?

857
00:56:07,747 --> 00:56:09,681
Laughing without any sound.

858
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,174
I can't understand anything.

859
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:13,018
I'm getting scared.

860
00:56:13,686 --> 00:56:15,347
You seem to be hard nosed man.

861
00:56:15,855 --> 00:56:17,686
My destiny, it's all my fate.

862
00:56:18,024 --> 00:56:18,718
What did you say?

863
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,252
Fate. - That's me.

864
00:56:26,066 --> 00:56:27,533
Fate. - Is it?

865
00:56:27,734 --> 00:56:28,200
Please sit down.

866
00:56:30,403 --> 00:56:31,870
What's going to happen now?

867
00:56:32,672 --> 00:56:34,299
What are you going to do?

868
00:56:34,874 --> 00:56:37,035
What have you come here for?
- I'm here to play.

869
00:56:37,444 --> 00:56:37,967
Get me the shells.

870
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:45,606
With whom?
- To play with your son's love?

871
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:47,011
What are you upto?

872
00:56:49,355 --> 00:56:50,515
I do my duty.

873
00:56:50,723 --> 00:56:51,951
What's your duty?

874
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:54,925
No one can play with my son's love.

875
00:56:55,128 --> 00:56:56,595
I'm here for that.

876
00:56:57,097 --> 00:57:00,555
You can play your tricks here.
- No one has ever won over fate.

877
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:02,801
So, you won't let good things
happen, right?

878
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,129
What is destined to happen will happen.
That's fate.

879
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:07,272
What is going to happen now?

880
00:57:09,242 --> 00:57:11,836
Don't smile like that.
I'm getting scared.

881
00:57:12,145 --> 00:57:14,443
Find someone else to
show your villainy.

882
00:57:14,647 --> 00:57:16,274
Find young men for it.

883
00:57:18,718 --> 00:57:21,118
I'll play my son's game.

884
00:57:21,421 --> 00:57:22,251
You play your game.

885
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:23,614
Throw the shells.

886
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:27,253
Oh my God! One.

887
00:57:33,333 --> 00:57:34,129
Where is the phone?

888
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:36,498
I keep changing its place.

889
00:57:37,003 --> 00:57:37,901
Here it is.

890
00:57:38,104 --> 00:57:38,798
Hello...

891
00:57:39,405 --> 00:57:40,736
Is Vishnu darling there?

892
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:43,040
I'll beat you with slipper.
Hang the phone.

893
00:57:44,644 --> 00:57:45,872
Vishnu, where are you?

894
00:57:46,179 --> 00:57:47,203
What's it? - Come here.

895
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:48,940
I need to know something.

896
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:53,216
You're darling to whom?
Me or the entire city?

897
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,350
Tell me. What's her name?

898
00:57:55,755 --> 00:57:56,915
The great Ramya.

899
00:57:57,991 --> 00:57:59,015
Sounds familiar.

900
00:58:00,994 --> 00:58:02,689
Hi darling! - Ramya, how are you?

901
00:58:02,896 --> 00:58:04,158
I would've come to the airport
if you had informed me.

902
00:58:05,031 --> 00:58:07,158
Welcome Ms. Queen.

903
00:58:07,367 --> 00:58:11,167
I'm not any Queen.
I'm now Chennai cyclone.

904
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,668
Is your sister's husband darling to you?

905
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,097
Relax.

906
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,135
How can I when trouble
maker is in home?

907
00:58:18,711 --> 00:58:20,372
Have you come from Chennai for this?

908
00:58:21,114 --> 00:58:22,012
Is everyone fine at home?

909
00:58:22,315 --> 00:58:23,646
How is mom? How is dad?

910
00:58:24,017 --> 00:58:25,211
And his blood pressure?

911
00:58:25,518 --> 00:58:26,951
That's the dowry I've brought with me.

912
00:58:27,153 --> 00:58:27,642
Blood pressure.

913
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:29,448
What's wrong with you!

914
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:33,017
Tamil Sangam above your head,
a husband under your thumbs.

915
00:58:33,226 --> 00:58:34,193
Very lucky.

916
00:58:34,494 --> 00:58:35,859
What have you brought from Chennai?

917
00:58:36,062 --> 00:58:37,256
2 bottles of...
- Pickle?

918
00:58:37,997 --> 00:58:39,191
Our mom must have sent it.

919
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:41,524
2 bottles of Cooum water.

920
00:58:41,834 --> 00:58:43,529
What's happening?

921
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:46,732
Stop smiling.

922
00:58:48,441 --> 00:58:51,035
So, Ms. Chennai Cyclone,
how long are you planning to stay here?

923
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,546
Till you don't get bored of me.

924
00:58:55,215 --> 00:58:56,341
I'll slap you.

925
00:58:56,849 --> 00:58:58,282
I'm a laughing stock to everyone.

926
00:58:58,718 --> 00:59:00,709
Air hostess' test my patience.

927
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:03,621
What's it? Give it to me.

928
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,986
To my beau.

929
00:59:08,061 --> 00:59:09,494
Calling him beau?

930
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,956
Sister's husband is my brother-in-law, right?

931
00:59:11,164 --> 00:59:11,687
Yes.

932
00:59:11,898 --> 00:59:13,058
He is my beau in both ways.

933
00:59:13,266 --> 00:59:13,789
How come?

934
00:59:15,335 --> 00:59:16,996
I will kill you.

935
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,537
Is she making fun or teasing me?

936
00:59:19,739 --> 00:59:22,105
My blood pressure
shoots up with her arrival.

937
00:59:24,944 --> 00:59:25,808
Oh my God!

938
00:59:26,546 --> 00:59:27,877
Didn't you notice me?

939
00:59:28,781 --> 00:59:29,304
I did not.

940
00:59:29,916 --> 00:59:30,746
Didn't notice me?

941
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:33,945
If you didn't hear my voice,
then something is wrong.

942
00:59:34,721 --> 00:59:38,248
I think there is someone
hovering on your heart. - Shit!

943
00:59:39,058 --> 00:59:42,050
Shilpi! I'm a mind reader.

944
00:59:42,462 --> 00:59:43,759
Tell me, who is it?

945
00:59:44,564 --> 00:59:45,496
There is nothing like that.

946
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,534
Why are you running away?
Tell the matter...

947
00:59:50,403 --> 00:59:51,199
There is a guy called Bharathi.

948
00:59:51,804 --> 00:59:53,032
I hate his looks...

949
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:56,166
His sharp looks are
embarrassing me.

950
00:59:56,643 --> 00:59:58,042
He is troubling me a lot.

951
00:59:59,012 --> 00:59:59,979
Do you like him?

952
01:00:00,613 --> 01:00:01,637
I swear, no...

953
01:00:02,282 --> 01:00:03,340
Okay, tell me where he is...

954
01:00:03,549 --> 01:00:04,277
I'll stab him.

955
01:00:04,484 --> 01:00:06,452
Oh no! Don't kill him...

956
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:07,551
Police will catch us...

957
01:00:08,054 --> 01:00:09,316
I'll stab him with my smile.

958
01:00:09,622 --> 01:00:11,681
I'll deal with him...
Tell his address.

959
01:00:12,292 --> 01:00:13,020
I'm here for you.

960
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:23,165
Old man, where is Plot no:27?
- It's there...

961
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:25,196
Who is it?

962
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:27,699
Is it you?

963
01:00:27,907 --> 01:00:28,532
Yes.

964
01:00:28,975 --> 01:00:30,101
Do you love her?

965
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:31,205
Yes.

966
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,442
Tamil girl?

967
01:00:36,082 --> 01:00:38,550
Reward for love!

968
01:00:39,585 --> 01:00:41,553
Oh my God!

969
01:00:42,488 --> 01:00:43,648
You donkey!

970
01:00:45,158 --> 01:00:48,025
How far you've reached in love?
- Nuwara Eliya?

971
01:00:48,161 --> 01:00:51,255
Why stopped there?
You can go till Japan, can't you?

972
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,588
That's enough...

973
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:53,663
No, that isn't enough...

974
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:56,568
Reward of love!

975
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:58,498
Are you her relative?

976
01:00:58,705 --> 01:00:59,967
Yeah. - Name?

977
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:02,107
Chennai Cyclone.
- Why has it struck here?

978
01:01:02,475 --> 01:01:05,376
Hey, if you still trouble that girl,
I won't spare you alive.

979
01:01:05,611 --> 01:01:06,475
You fool!

980
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:08,674
First put a plaster to your bloody nose.

981
01:01:08,948 --> 01:01:10,381
I'll if there is bleeding.

982
01:01:12,118 --> 01:01:12,743
Is it okay now?

983
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:15,616
Yes...

984
01:01:31,637 --> 01:01:34,003
Ramya, didn't you tell me that
you've beaten him?

985
01:01:34,540 --> 01:01:35,802
Look he is dancing there?

986
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:37,939
I didn't beat this man.

987
01:01:38,211 --> 01:01:39,576
I beat the guy named Bharathi.

988
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,247
Oh No! His name is Bharathi.

989
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:43,039
Really?

990
01:01:43,883 --> 01:01:45,612
<i>Who did I punch then?</i>

991
01:01:47,153 --> 01:01:48,950
Don't you love this guy?

992
01:01:49,756 --> 01:01:50,916
I swear, no.

993
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:53,859
Shilpa, he is dazzling in my heart.

994
01:01:54,494 --> 01:01:56,689
Shall I love this fool?

995
01:01:57,697 --> 01:01:58,288
Which place he belongs to?

996
01:01:58,498 --> 01:01:59,226
Chennai.

997
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:03,499
Two cyclones in one place!

998
01:02:08,741 --> 01:02:09,901
Come on you dangerous man...

999
01:02:10,576 --> 01:02:12,305
I thought you disappeared
in the middle of the show...

1000
01:02:12,512 --> 01:02:13,706
I've kept my cap, didn't I?

1001
01:02:13,913 --> 01:02:16,575
Which family you ruined
in the mean time?

1002
01:02:16,883 --> 01:02:18,043
Like a film villain!

1003
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,978
I'm waiting here for you.

1004
01:02:20,219 --> 01:02:21,379
You're late.

1005
01:02:21,921 --> 01:02:23,183
Even if I come late...

1006
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:26,624
I'll be hot!
- Nothing less in this!

1007
01:02:26,893 --> 01:02:29,191
I've checkmated your son's love.

1008
01:02:29,395 --> 01:02:31,329
What? What do you mean?

1009
01:02:31,531 --> 01:02:36,093
Be careful. I've introduced
a new character...

1010
01:03:13,773 --> 01:03:16,708
Who is he? Dancing well...
Is he a new guy?

1011
01:03:35,328 --> 01:03:35,987
Oh sorry!

1012
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:37,618
I've come to meet you only.

1013
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:39,529
Just tripped.

1014
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:40,730
Don't worry.

1015
01:03:41,501 --> 01:03:43,799
You dashed against 'Love' only.

1016
01:03:44,504 --> 01:03:45,368
What do you mean, brother?

1017
01:03:45,872 --> 01:03:48,705
Personification of love!

1018
01:03:49,709 --> 01:03:50,505
Oh That's great!

1019
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:52,170
I'm Bharathi.

1020
01:03:53,346 --> 01:03:54,904
You dance very well... - Thank you.

1021
01:03:55,248 --> 01:03:55,771
I'm Roshan.

1022
01:03:56,182 --> 01:03:57,581
Roshan from Mumbai.

1023
01:03:57,950 --> 01:03:59,747
Okay. This is my friend, Banerjee.

1024
01:03:59,952 --> 01:04:00,816
Greetings...

1025
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,521
I like your saying
"Personification of love".

1026
01:04:05,424 --> 01:04:08,689
I love a girl for the past 12 years.

1027
01:04:08,895 --> 01:04:10,760
Wow! Great love!

1028
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:13,425
Love is a pleasant feeling.
- Well said!

1029
01:04:14,033 --> 01:04:15,022
I like falling in love.

1030
01:04:15,301 --> 01:04:16,325
Apart from that,
I like all lovers!

1031
01:04:17,803 --> 01:04:18,827
I came here yesterday only.

1032
01:04:19,171 --> 01:04:21,435
I never expected I'll befriend
such good men so quickly.

1033
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:23,905
Nice meeting you...

1034
01:04:29,882 --> 01:04:31,713
Why don't you drink even a Beer?

1035
01:04:31,918 --> 01:04:33,078
I don't have coffee or tea also.

1036
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:34,786
He is Mother's son! Leave him...

1037
01:04:35,187 --> 01:04:36,552
Tell us about your love...

1038
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,685
Language of love is very good!

1039
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,782
You're right! Love is a pleasant feeling.

1040
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:42,458
Does your girl friend stay here?

1041
01:04:42,662 --> 01:04:43,651
No, she has come to Srilanka.

1042
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:45,026
Friend, do you know one thing?

1043
01:04:45,264 --> 01:04:46,731
My love is very costly.

1044
01:04:47,066 --> 01:04:50,297
I'm in a star hotel and searching
my girl friend in a rented Toyota car.

1045
01:04:50,536 --> 01:04:54,734
Daily I spend 5000 dollars.
- 5000 dollars?!

1046
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,032
Money isn't important for me.

1047
01:04:56,242 --> 01:04:57,470
My darling is important!

1048
01:04:57,677 --> 01:05:01,875
You say you love her, and searching her,
I'm not able to get you.

1049
01:05:02,114 --> 01:05:05,572
We have to face many hurdles
to win over love.

1050
01:05:05,952 --> 01:05:07,715
You mean, is it one sided love?
- No. She too loves me...

1051
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,147
I've the love letter written by her.

1052
01:05:09,622 --> 01:05:11,021
We both were classmates in 8th std.

1053
01:05:11,223 --> 01:05:12,622
I started loving her from then.

1054
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:15,259
Oh! It seems to be great!

1055
01:05:16,062 --> 01:05:17,256
This seems to be a big flashback!

1056
01:05:17,897 --> 01:05:19,558
That is just an infatuation!

1057
01:05:20,132 --> 01:05:22,430
Love is like measles.

1058
01:05:23,235 --> 01:05:24,031
You will get it only in childhood.

1059
01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:25,164
It's a pure love!

1060
01:05:25,938 --> 01:05:29,965
Wow Great! Language of love
is very good! - Yes boss.

1061
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:33,141
I was a little super star.

1062
01:05:33,980 --> 01:05:35,709
I enjoyed those days with great fun and joy.

1063
01:05:36,382 --> 01:05:37,679
The way I go to school was stylish.

1064
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:40,184
When I was in 8th std,
one day I forgot to wear the tie.

1065
01:05:40,586 --> 01:05:43,316
My teacher won't allow students
without ties in class.

1066
01:05:43,723 --> 01:05:45,350
Do you know what I did for that?

1067
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:49,855
Next day, I went to school... how?!

1068
01:05:50,062 --> 01:05:52,360
Sir, may I come in? - Yes...

1069
01:05:57,903 --> 01:06:00,201
Roshan, what type of dress is this?!

1070
01:06:00,406 --> 01:06:03,375
Sir, didn't you tell me
to come wearing the tie?

1071
01:06:03,576 --> 01:06:04,543
Here is my tie!

1072
01:06:06,646 --> 01:06:08,204
Love blooming at matured
age is true love.

1073
01:06:08,414 --> 01:06:11,542
No! - Your love is greater
than love in films!

1074
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:14,720
Love at childhood days is
the foundation to your life!

1075
01:06:15,087 --> 01:06:17,885
It become infatuation when
it comes at young age.

1076
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:19,717
Hello, I won't accept it.

1077
01:06:19,925 --> 01:06:22,155
Did you express your love to her?

1078
01:06:22,361 --> 01:06:24,727
Yes. I told her dad also.

1079
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:26,795
What did you say? Love?

1080
01:06:28,601 --> 01:06:30,569
Boss, yours is true love!

1081
01:06:30,770 --> 01:06:32,237
Uncle, tell me yes or no, I'll go.

1082
01:06:32,438 --> 01:06:34,065
Get out. First finish your studies
and then come...

1083
01:06:34,440 --> 01:06:35,998
I'll complete my plus two and come.

1084
01:06:36,275 --> 01:06:37,071
Is it okay for you?

1085
01:06:37,276 --> 01:06:39,904
Will you be in 12th std till
you are 24?

1086
01:06:40,112 --> 01:06:43,741
Come here after 12 years...
Till then, don't disturb her!

1087
01:06:43,949 --> 01:06:46,247
I waited 12 years for her.

1088
01:06:46,786 --> 01:06:48,481
Did you go there after 12 years?
- Yes.

1089
01:06:48,721 --> 01:06:49,745
Rascal, is it you?

1090
01:06:49,955 --> 01:06:53,413
You stupid fellow!
Didn't forget her till now?

1091
01:06:53,626 --> 01:06:55,093
Uncle, it's impossible!

1092
01:06:55,394 --> 01:06:57,760
I'm here now after waiting
12 years for her.

1093
01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:59,859
I want to meet her now. Call her.
- She is not here.

1094
01:07:00,466 --> 01:07:03,435
Uncle, it's an agreement between us.
Keep your word.

1095
01:07:03,636 --> 01:07:04,102
I'll hit you.

1096
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:06,601
That's not in the agreement.
Call your daughter.

1097
01:07:06,806 --> 01:07:07,932
Didn't I tell you that she isn't here?

1098
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:08,868
Then where is she?

1099
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:10,434
She is in her brother's house in Srilanka.

1100
01:07:10,643 --> 01:07:11,769
Did you meet your girl?

1101
01:07:11,977 --> 01:07:13,103
Not yet.

1102
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:15,780
Do you think she still loves you?

1103
01:07:16,649 --> 01:07:20,278
100% sure!

1104
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:21,948
If she forgets you, then?

1105
01:07:22,154 --> 01:07:23,781
I'll recollect the past.

1106
01:07:24,023 --> 01:07:24,955
What proof you have?

1107
01:07:25,157 --> 01:07:28,615
I've kept the love letter
written by her safely.

1108
01:07:28,994 --> 01:07:30,052
Very good!

1109
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:34,332
I've memorised each and
every letter of it!

1110
01:07:34,500 --> 01:07:36,798
That has become a precious
holy script to me!

1111
01:07:37,002 --> 01:07:40,961
Wow! Great brother!

1112
01:07:42,675 --> 01:07:43,972
Hey useless fellow.

1113
01:07:44,176 --> 01:07:48,806
One guy has entered to ruin your love.

1114
01:07:49,014 --> 01:07:51,073
Get up, man.

1115
01:07:52,184 --> 01:07:53,481
Dad, why are you beating me like this?

1116
01:07:53,686 --> 01:07:55,881
Now love is growing fast like fast food.

1117
01:07:56,088 --> 01:07:57,817
First meeting and then dating...

1118
01:07:58,023 --> 01:07:59,149
And then cheating.

1119
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:01,087
Lovers are moving fast.

1120
01:08:02,094 --> 01:08:03,391
You're simply wasting your time.

1121
01:08:03,629 --> 01:08:05,324
Somehow, try to trap her.

1122
01:08:05,531 --> 01:08:09,092
Reach pinnacles of love game.
Don't go into deep dungeons.

1123
01:08:09,435 --> 01:08:10,993
Make my plan successful.

1124
01:08:13,806 --> 01:08:14,670
I love you.

1125
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,666
Even if you do,
I won't fall in love with you.

1126
01:08:18,878 --> 01:08:20,675
You should love me.
My dad has ordered me!

1127
01:08:21,213 --> 01:08:21,941
Not interested in me?

1128
01:08:22,148 --> 01:08:24,343
Take this bracelet and start loving me.

1129
01:08:24,717 --> 01:08:25,684
This is my gift for you.

1130
01:08:26,218 --> 01:08:27,845
I won't take gifts from anybody.

1131
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:29,278
You are scared!

1132
01:08:29,822 --> 01:08:30,720
If you wear this bracelet.

1133
01:08:30,923 --> 01:08:33,858
You fear that you may
start loving me.

1134
01:08:34,059 --> 01:08:34,855
Why should I?

1135
01:08:35,060 --> 01:08:35,958
Then accept it.

1136
01:08:36,729 --> 01:08:38,526
Didn't I tell you that I don't love you?

1137
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:40,857
After wearing this,
if you still don't love me,

1138
01:08:41,167 --> 01:08:42,134
I'll leave you.

1139
01:08:42,401 --> 01:08:43,595
It's a gentleman's agreement!

1140
01:08:45,805 --> 01:08:47,136
Sure? - Yes.

1141
01:08:47,406 --> 01:08:48,703
I'll take back my bracelet.

1142
01:08:49,408 --> 01:08:52,707
I'm accepting this just to prove
that I don't love you. - Okay.

1143
01:08:52,912 --> 01:08:55,540
But I'll pay you for this. - Okay.

1144
01:08:57,416 --> 01:08:58,542
Rs. 2000, is it okay?

1145
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:00,719
It's okay to me if you give just Rs.1!

1146
01:09:01,854 --> 01:09:03,549
Help me please...
I have to study now...

1147
01:09:04,323 --> 01:09:05,221
Help me please...

1148
01:09:05,424 --> 01:09:06,721
We both should become lovers!

1149
01:09:07,092 --> 01:09:09,060
Get lost! - Okay.

1150
01:09:09,261 --> 01:09:11,559
Bharathi, your dreams
should come true...

1151
01:09:11,764 --> 01:09:13,561
You should taste the fruit of joy.

1152
01:09:14,767 --> 01:09:15,563
Aunty...

1153
01:09:22,842 --> 01:09:27,074
Whatever I say, you should say 'wrong'.
- Okay.

1154
01:09:28,781 --> 01:09:30,180
Why am I getting disturbed now?

1155
01:09:30,382 --> 01:09:31,406
It's wrong.

1156
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:35,412
Why didn't I abuse him?

1157
01:09:35,788 --> 01:09:36,755
It's wrong.

1158
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:40,190
Why did I accept his gift?

1159
01:09:40,459 --> 01:09:41,426
It's wrong.

1160
01:09:41,727 --> 01:09:49,099
I will never fall in love in my life!

1161
01:09:49,635 --> 01:09:50,602
It's wrong.

1162
01:09:52,671 --> 01:09:54,696
Did you find your girl?

1163
01:09:54,907 --> 01:09:55,931
Srilanka is a small nation.

1164
01:09:56,141 --> 01:09:58,939
I'll knock every door here
to find her, I'll find her.

1165
01:09:59,144 --> 01:10:00,941
You can walk the nation to find her.

1166
01:10:01,146 --> 01:10:02,135
Yes...

1167
01:10:02,381 --> 01:10:03,109
If you want, I'll also come with you.

1168
01:10:03,315 --> 01:10:04,612
Let's chant her name
and roam on streets.

1169
01:10:05,317 --> 01:10:06,341
What is her name?

1170
01:10:06,819 --> 01:10:07,615
Shilpa.

1171
01:10:07,987 --> 01:10:09,284
Nice name.

1172
01:10:16,061 --> 01:10:18,621
Oh my God!

1173
01:10:20,933 --> 01:10:23,629
Why is he beating him?
- I'll kill you!

1174
01:10:24,069 --> 01:10:25,969
Scoundrel, why are you
behaving like this?

1175
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:27,297
Move away...

1176
01:10:29,742 --> 01:10:30,970
Hey, don't beat him.
Why are you beating him?

1177
01:10:33,345 --> 01:10:33,811
Calm down.

1178
01:10:34,013 --> 01:10:34,980
He beat me first.

1179
01:10:35,347 --> 01:10:37,474
Both of you are love the same girl.

1180
01:10:38,017 --> 01:10:39,041
Oh my God!

1181
01:10:40,352 --> 01:10:41,819
Stop it!

1182
01:10:43,055 --> 01:10:44,420
Why should we fight?

1183
01:10:44,957 --> 01:10:48,654
Let her choose one amongst us.
Let's leave it to her!

1184
01:10:49,595 --> 01:10:55,090
Let's be a good friends till then.
Okay?

1185
01:10:56,535 --> 01:10:57,661
Stop it!

1186
01:10:58,103 --> 01:10:58,660
Okay.

1187
01:11:02,207 --> 01:11:03,674
Let's not fight.

1188
01:11:57,363 --> 01:12:03,893
Daddy, don't beat me.
I won't do it.

1189
01:12:31,797 --> 01:12:34,925
Old man, love should come as natural feeling.

1190
01:12:35,401 --> 01:12:42,603
Forced love is dishonest.
This is not fair.

1191
01:12:43,142 --> 01:12:48,944
There's nothing like cheating.
Everything is fair in love and war.

1192
01:12:51,083 --> 01:12:56,612
If you take bribe to vote and say
honestly I voted for him, that isn't honesty.

1193
01:12:56,822 --> 01:12:59,518
You should never accept bribe, that is honesty.

1194
01:12:59,758 --> 01:13:01,521
Are you epitome of honesty?

1195
01:13:01,994 --> 01:13:06,055
What ever you say...
finally, my son will win.

1196
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:10,392
The buried photo came out,
what do you mean by it?

1197
01:13:12,771 --> 01:13:15,797
He's a trouble.
Laughing silently.

1198
01:13:16,842 --> 01:13:18,810
What? Shall we end the game?

1199
01:13:19,912 --> 01:13:23,643
The game has just begun.

1200
01:13:23,849 --> 01:13:24,747
Troubles? - No.

1201
01:13:45,537 --> 01:13:49,564
My son... dear, are you fine?

1202
01:13:50,709 --> 01:13:52,836
I was waiting for your phone call.

1203
01:13:53,879 --> 01:13:57,440
Happy birthday, my son!
