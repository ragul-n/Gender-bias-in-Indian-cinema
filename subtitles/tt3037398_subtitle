1
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,004
Kolkata.

2
00:03:37,353 --> 00:03:41,001
The city officially established
in 17th century by Job Charnock..

3
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:43,087
..has gone through vast change.

4
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:45,145
Like many other cities in the world..

5
00:03:45,772 --> 00:03:47,512
..the names of the lanes
and streets have changed.

6
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:50,918
Big flyovers, shopping malls..

7
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,434
..old building have been replaced
with high-rises.

8
00:03:55,839 --> 00:03:58,002
Kolkata which was the capital
of India in the past..

9
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:00,869
..can't be recognized easily
by its own flavor.

10
00:04:02,263 --> 00:04:08,060
Despite the changes there are
certain neighbourhoods, houses,

11
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:11,141
people and families where the flavor
of old Kolkata still exists.

12
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:13,691
In the present times of materialism..

13
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,886
..the financial condition of such
families may have deteriorated..

14
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:21,767
..but they haven't got
rid of their aristocratic attitude.

15
00:04:22,113 --> 00:04:23,291
We'll see two such families
and witness their lives.

16
00:04:24,291 --> 00:04:28,443
Our film is about them.
I mean our story.

17
00:04:29,546 --> 00:04:33,484
One of them is the family of
Pashupati Ghosh in Chitpur.

18
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:37,930
Let's take a look at the wedding
preparations going on there.

19
00:04:38,622 --> 00:04:42,535
You've been delaying for long.
Give me the expense details.

20
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,999
Finally you've got time to come.

21
00:04:46,432 --> 00:04:47,686
Boro Ma has fallen asleep
in the prayer room.

22
00:04:49,848 --> 00:04:50,799
Move aside.

23
00:04:51,362 --> 00:04:52,778
Hey!
- What?

24
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:57,462
I'll thrash you so hard that you'll
forget your profession, priest.

25
00:04:59,505 --> 00:05:02,935
Khagen, where are you?
Come quickly.

26
00:05:03,015 --> 00:05:05,324
Will you finish the decorations
after the wedding gets over?

27
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:07,821
I'm doing it.
What? I'll slap you hard. No excuses.

28
00:05:11,338 --> 00:05:12,376
Excuse me.

29
00:05:12,667 --> 00:05:13,727
Is Boro Ma in the prayer room?

30
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,057
Yes, go there quickly.

31
00:05:19,104 --> 00:05:20,185
Pashupati Ghosh.

32
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,045
His ancestors were
renowned landlords.

33
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:27,937
He had many properties
spread across North Kolkata.

34
00:05:29,406 --> 00:05:31,439
In the past they were
into the business of stevedore.

35
00:05:32,163 --> 00:05:34,595
They used to supply
goods to the ships.

36
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:36,833
The business...

37
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:39,809
The business that they ran
from Khidderpore dock..

38
00:05:39,889 --> 00:05:41,117
..has gone for a toss.

39
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,749
They gradually kept selling
all their land and property..

40
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,692
..and now they're left only
with this house.

41
00:05:50,006 --> 00:05:50,936
The Ghosh Mansion.

42
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:54,882
This also can get sold any time.

43
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:01,236
Pashu, tell me something.

44
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,401
Isn't Saban also my daughter?
- Yes but..

45
00:06:05,995 --> 00:06:08,611
So, I also have the right to do
something in her wedding.

46
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:10,103
Isn't it?

47
00:06:11,173 --> 00:06:12,268
Listen to me.

48
00:06:12,348 --> 00:06:15,457
Nobody plays the shehnai
in the weddings these days.

49
00:06:15,878 --> 00:06:17,381
Listen to me.

50
00:06:17,597 --> 00:06:20,246
Arrange for 'sangeet'
(dance and music) function.

51
00:06:20,326 --> 00:06:23,376
Oh no! It's a bong wedding.

52
00:06:23,456 --> 00:06:25,397
They can't dance wildly like
the way they do in hindi films.

53
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,813
This is not done.

54
00:06:27,842 --> 00:06:30,167
Felu's mother..
- Yes, sir.

55
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,988
Call Chor da.
- Okay.

56
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:35,586
Has the priest come?
- He has just arrived.

57
00:06:35,666 --> 00:06:36,753
He came just now?
- Yes.

58
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:37,716
I'll fire him today.

59
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:40,537
Listen, send Boro Ma here after
she finishes her prayers.

60
00:06:40,617 --> 00:06:41,099
Okay.

61
00:06:41,179 --> 00:06:43,089
Where's Shibu?
- I think he went out.

62
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:44,429
Where did he go?

63
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,235
All of you're useless. Go.

64
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,018
Let the wedding get over
and I'll sack all of them.

65
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:51,964
Why are you so stressed?

66
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,972
I must know if the wedding invitation
cards have reached or not.

67
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:56,745
Manmatha is also very lazy.

68
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:59,415
He is always busy getting
dressed up and practicing music.

69
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:01,048
But he never gets to
perform in a show.

70
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:02,907
Forget it.

71
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:04,323
Tell me something.

72
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,685
Is Saban my daughter or not?
- Again?

73
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:11,977
It was Arjun's job to send
the wedding cards.

74
00:07:12,756 --> 00:07:14,410
Where's the lazy fellow?

75
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:18,864
Felu's mother, tell me
if Saban is my daughter or not.

76
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,724
Sir, did you call me?

77
00:07:22,804 --> 00:07:23,880
Where do all of you stay?

78
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:27,430
Where is Arjun?
- I don't know.

79
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,787
Whose job is to supervise
the wedding decoration?

80
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,747
Whose job is to send
the wedding cards?

81
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:32,828
What can Arjun do?

82
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:34,233
Doesn't he have his own work?

83
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36,103
He has no work.
- No..

84
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:38,071
He smokes marijuana
and is busy watching movies.

85
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,932
He's useless.
- Dad, I'm going out to visit Sapna.

86
00:07:41,012 --> 00:07:41,754
Mother is offering prayers.

87
00:07:41,834 --> 00:07:43,462
She's blowing the conch shell
and can't hear me.

88
00:07:43,542 --> 00:07:46,013
Hey Saban,
why are you roaming around?

89
00:07:46,093 --> 00:07:47,494
Is this the time to roam around?

90
00:07:47,574 --> 00:07:49,761
You're going to get married.
Come here.

91
00:07:51,188 --> 00:07:52,885
Come. Sit here.

92
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,283
Look Saban, tell me something.

93
00:07:58,094 --> 00:07:59,543
Aren't you also my daughter?

94
00:08:00,937 --> 00:08:01,662
Isn't it?

95
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:03,554
I need your suggestion.

96
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:07,249
Forget your dad,
he won't say anything.

97
00:08:08,341 --> 00:08:12,038
What do you prefer for your wedding?
Shehnai or sangeet?

98
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,157
None of them.
- What do you mean?

99
00:08:14,622 --> 00:08:16,806
Why are you wasting your time
after such useless things?

100
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,257
Useless things?

101
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,808
You think my daughter's wedding
is something useless?

102
00:08:21,014 --> 00:08:23,630
Is 'sangeet' ceremony useless?
- Forget your sangeet.

103
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,383
Stop it.
- let me speak.

104
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,064
Keep quite.

105
00:08:26,144 --> 00:08:27,556
Saban is also my daughter.
- yes.

106
00:08:27,636 --> 00:08:28,850
This is a wedding of Ghosh family.

107
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,995
Our friends and relatives
will attend the wedding.

108
00:08:30,075 --> 00:08:31,001
How can it be complete
without the sound of shehnai?

109
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:32,644
I'm going to Sapna's house.
- Look at her.

110
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:34,222
Don't create problems.

111
00:08:34,302 --> 00:08:37,174
Sister.. Boro ma is calling you
in the prayer room.

112
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,587
What's wrong with you?

113
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,359
There's somebody outside.
- Who?

114
00:08:40,803 --> 00:08:42,024
Shibu, go and check.
- Okay.

115
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,743
Let's go.

116
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,289
Early in the morning you are..

117
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:49,386
Pashu, tell me something.

118
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,408
Isn't Saban my daughter?
- Yes.

119
00:08:54,802 --> 00:08:55,678
Call brother.

120
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:01,168
Call brother.

121
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:04,195
Keshto da, please leave now.

122
00:09:05,016 --> 00:09:06,973
There's a wedding in the family.
Everybody is busy.

123
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:09,214
Call him.

124
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,300
Please leave now.

125
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:12,554
Let this month pass.

126
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:13,906
Hey!
- What's this?

127
00:09:13,986 --> 00:09:18,302
Will you decide when I should come?

128
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,135
What do you think?
Call him. Call brother.

129
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:22,237
Why are you creating
unnecessary problems?

130
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:26,201
Sir is busy. Please go.
- Hey! Don't act before me.

131
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,963
I hail from the theater
neighbourhood.

132
00:09:28,043 --> 00:09:30,266
I've grown up watching
drama rehearsals.

133
00:09:31,012 --> 00:09:34,128
It was my dream to be
an actor or singer.

134
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:37,788
But, I couldn't be one because
of my stammering problem.

135
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,249
I provide transport to the theatre
companies now.

136
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:42,212
If you act smart you'll be in trouble.
- Leave me.

137
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:43,293
C'mon go in.

138
00:09:43,466 --> 00:09:45,325
Borda.
- Hey Borda!

139
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:48,547
Borda! Hey Borda!

140
00:09:48,627 --> 00:09:49,650
Hey Borda!

141
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,601
I told you..

142
00:09:50,681 --> 00:09:52,741
Look they're busy working.

143
00:09:52,821 --> 00:09:54,623
Move.
- Borda!

144
00:09:54,703 --> 00:09:56,623
Go upstairs.

145
00:09:56,703 --> 00:09:58,662
You're just eating and gaining weight.
- Yes.

146
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:00,349
Listen..
- Borda!

147
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,430
Khagen! Hey Khagen!
- Where are you?

148
00:10:04,014 --> 00:10:04,706
Here he is.

149
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,455
How dare you enter my house any time?

150
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,704
I've to get in if you don't
come out. Right?

151
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:16,034
What do you think?
Am I a beggar or your enemy?

152
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,018
Why are you behaving so rudely?

153
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:20,402
Isn't it?
- Yes.

154
00:10:21,602 --> 00:10:22,705
I told you that you to
vacate the ground floor.

155
00:10:23,083 --> 00:10:25,007
I just need a small space
to set up my office..

156
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:28,005
..and start my transport business.

157
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:31,140
You can take charge of my office
and be the manager.

158
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:31,850
Yes.

159
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,587
It'll be a source of income.
- Yes.

160
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:36,712
Isn't it?
- Yes.

161
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,810
We'll divide the profit equally.

162
00:10:40,156 --> 00:10:43,248
You'll have an income and
I also won't have to resort to..

163
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:44,909
..hooliganism to earn my livelihood.

164
00:10:44,989 --> 00:10:46,271
Isn't it?
- Yes.

165
00:10:46,682 --> 00:10:50,660
But, you didn't accept my offer.

166
00:10:51,363 --> 00:10:52,901
Do know what Mr. Sharma
has proposed to do?

167
00:10:53,247 --> 00:10:55,528
He'll vacate the house and
construct a new building here.

168
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:57,809
I'll get a new office in it.

169
00:10:57,889 --> 00:10:59,031
Isn't it?
- What?

170
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:03,568
Things have changed.
I'm working for Sharma now.

171
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:07,352
What did you understand?
- Listen to me.

172
00:11:07,665 --> 00:11:10,151
I'll never vacate this house and go.

173
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,654
This is my ancestral house.

174
00:11:12,027 --> 00:11:13,465
I won't leave this house.

175
00:11:13,768 --> 00:11:16,622
Tell Sharma that a petty goon
like you can't scare me.

176
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:21,217
Let him send criminals, ministers,
MLA, MP, anybody..

177
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:22,381
..but I won't vacate
the house and go.

178
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:24,219
If you come here again
I'll call the police.

179
00:11:24,299 --> 00:11:27,516
What are you saying?
- Shut up!

180
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:33,968
What do you want Pashu to do?
What?

181
00:11:34,357 --> 00:11:35,968
You listen to me.

182
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,633
This locality is not
your personal property. Got it?

183
00:11:39,713 --> 00:11:41,078
Hey!
- Hold on.

184
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:44,440
This is not only Pashu's house
but it's also my house.

185
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,478
And talking about money.

186
00:11:45,683 --> 00:11:47,478
It's not just Sharma who's rich,
I also have money.

187
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:52,095
Return Sharma's money and
meet me in my office.

188
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:53,458
The matter is over. Got it?

189
00:11:53,538 --> 00:11:54,571
Get lost.

190
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:58,809
Why are you unnecessarily
getting involved in this matter?

191
00:11:58,889 --> 00:12:01,530
'Salutations to the lord.'

192
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,957
'May peace be with all.'

193
00:12:08,492 --> 00:12:09,620
Yes, sister.

194
00:12:10,042 --> 00:12:11,047
Hey Keshto..

195
00:12:15,793 --> 00:12:16,831
Stop it.

196
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,842
You've drenched me.

197
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:20,077
Hey..

198
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:23,234
Go from here.

199
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:25,357
Why are you standing here? Go.
- What's this?

200
00:12:25,437 --> 00:12:26,524
Let's go, Pashu.

201
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:28,427
Will you go or not?

202
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,249
Why are you staring at us?

203
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:33,640
Do your work, scoundrels.
Do your work

204
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,786
Lazy fellows!

205
00:12:34,866 --> 00:12:36,992
I want the pandal to be
completed today.

206
00:12:37,402 --> 00:12:39,283
The scoundrels just waste time.

207
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:41,370
Where is Arjun?

208
00:12:41,817 --> 00:12:43,200
Shibu, come here.

209
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,454
Go and get Arjun by any means.

210
00:12:46,757 --> 00:12:49,211
He's going to get thrashed by me.
I'll beat him badly.

211
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,590
Do something. Come with me.

212
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,201
Pashu, I'll leave now.

213
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:55,882
Hey! Go from here.

214
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:02,984
Go away from here now. Go.
- 'May peace be with you.'

215
00:13:03,851 --> 00:13:05,030
Go.

216
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,716
Did you get oblation?
- Yes.

217
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:09,808
Go home now.

218
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,529
You saw a family just now.

219
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:14,859
Pashupati Ghosh's family.

220
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,486
There's one more family involved
in this story.

221
00:13:17,983 --> 00:13:19,561
I told you about two families. Right?

222
00:13:19,843 --> 00:13:20,999
Agarwal family.

223
00:13:21,797 --> 00:13:22,764
They live in the same
neighbourhood.

224
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:24,164
Their houses are located close by.

225
00:13:24,244 --> 00:13:26,693
Hey!
- Shall I?

226
00:13:27,364 --> 00:13:28,845
Pashupati's school friend.

227
00:13:29,853 --> 00:13:31,248
His childhood friend.

228
00:13:32,156 --> 00:13:34,286
After school..
- Again?

229
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,007
Pravin somehow managed
to pass school,

230
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:43,304
Finished his education
and took over the family business.

231
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:49,502
Arjun! Arjun! Rascal!
- Arjun da!

232
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:52,497
Where are you?
- Arjun da!

233
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,962
This is Pravin Agarwal's house.

234
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:00,205
He has a business of fireworks.

235
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,443
He has a shop in Burrabazar.

236
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:06,803
Suresh Chandra Agarwal
became a millionaire..

237
00:14:06,883 --> 00:14:08,825
..by manufacturing crackers
for Diwali and Kali puja.

238
00:14:09,874 --> 00:14:12,101
Hey scoundrel!

239
00:14:12,181 --> 00:14:13,441
Why are you shouting?

240
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,340
Arjun is not at home.
He has gone to work.

241
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,540
Yes, I know he has gone to work.

242
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,740
I know very well what work he does.

243
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,167
He's always drugged.

244
00:14:19,383 --> 00:14:20,767
You know everything.

245
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,659
Call Manda.

246
00:14:22,739 --> 00:14:24,021
Manda can't go down.

247
00:14:24,101 --> 00:14:25,269
She's doing the household chores.

248
00:14:25,788 --> 00:14:28,102
Listen, what's in your hand?

249
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:30,664
You've started drinking vodka
early in the morning.

250
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,810
Tell her to stop doing
the chores and come down.

251
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:36,933
Manda! Manda!
- I told you that she can't go down.

252
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:38,922
Why not? Is she a princess?

253
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:40,847
Who'll do the household chores? You?

254
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:41,874
What a problem!

255
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:43,420
Shibu, do something.

256
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,462
Go to Ganesh Talkies.
I'm sure he's there. Go.

257
00:14:45,542 --> 00:14:49,278
Yes, he goes to Ganesh Talkies
because he works there.

258
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:51,106
He works there.
I know what work he does.

259
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:52,024
You think he works.

260
00:14:52,104 --> 00:14:53,884
There isn't a worse theatre than that
in the entire world.

261
00:14:53,964 --> 00:14:55,473
Yes. It's a rotten movie theatre.

262
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:59,188
He works for you because
you don't take care of that business.

263
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,123
You don't have anything better to do.

264
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:03,599
So, you've given him the charge
of that dilapidated movie hall.

265
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,066
Why are you standing here? Go.
- Yes, go.

266
00:15:06,146 --> 00:15:07,753
Go and find him. go.
Quick.

267
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,050
He starts with his drama early
in the morning.

268
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:11,147
She always keeps complaining.

269
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:14,798
Yes. Keep drinking vodka
from early morning.

270
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:17,698
Manda! Hey Manda!

271
00:15:21,957 --> 00:15:22,984
Well, I was saying..

272
00:15:23,503 --> 00:15:25,549
Pravin's father
Anil Chandra Agarwal..

273
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,911
..suddenly decided to start a

274
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:31,095
new business along
with the fireworks business.

275
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:33,905
What business?
Business of film making.

276
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:35,754
That was a good idea.

277
00:15:36,446 --> 00:15:40,957
You know the typical Bengali films
with songs and action.

278
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,562
He invested a lot of money
in one such a Bengali film.

279
00:15:44,892 --> 00:15:48,257
You won't believe me,
it didn't do well.

280
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,643
Then he suddenly thought that
he would build a cinema hall..

281
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:56,811
..where he would show
the films produced by him.

282
00:15:58,757 --> 00:15:59,925
Ganesh Talkies was built.

283
00:16:00,173 --> 00:16:04,273
He also set up a small film
distribution office.

284
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:11,901
But, today when multiplexes
are in vogue.

285
00:16:11,981 --> 00:16:13,317
Do you know what the condition
of Ganesh Talkies is?

286
00:16:13,728 --> 00:16:15,630
It's like a fish whose scales
have been removed.

287
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:24,492
What's up?

288
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,097
You are hardly seen these days.

289
00:16:28,146 --> 00:16:29,238
Why didn't you come in the morning?

290
00:16:30,038 --> 00:16:31,692
Did you plan anything
to get out of here?

291
00:16:33,565 --> 00:16:35,187
Forget about the plans, let me..

292
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:36,387
Leave me.

293
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:37,662
I'll tell everybody.

294
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:38,642
You'll be thrashed so badly that

295
00:16:38,722 --> 00:16:40,217
you'll forget your father's name.
Scoundrel!

296
00:16:40,297 --> 00:16:43,201
Oh my darling! But before that
you know what I'll do.

297
00:16:43,281 --> 00:16:44,347
I told you to leave me.

298
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,079
Have you ever thought what will
happen if anybody catches us?

299
00:16:47,296 --> 00:16:48,377
Crazy man!

300
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:49,966
Listen..

301
00:16:52,398 --> 00:16:53,652
let's go to Naihati.

302
00:16:54,387 --> 00:16:56,977
You'll live like a queen there.

303
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:58,155
Naihati?

304
00:16:58,663 --> 00:16:59,787
Yesterday you promised
to take me to Mumbai..

305
00:16:59,867 --> 00:17:01,269
..and now you're talking
about Naihati?

306
00:17:01,349 --> 00:17:04,285
O my darling! Love has no address.

307
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:07,796
Both Naihati
and Mumbai are the same.

308
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,855
Will you watch 'Dirty Picture'?
- No.

309
00:17:10,935 --> 00:17:11,796
Why not?

310
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:14,780
I would love to watch
'Saheb Biwi aur Gangster'.

311
00:17:15,061 --> 00:17:17,323
Randeep Hooda. He's awesome.

312
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,491
Hooda?
- hmm..

313
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:21,010
Come to the terrace at 3
in the noon or I'll thrash you badly.

314
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:22,718
Please make a plan to elope
from here first.

315
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:23,658
Elope..

316
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:27,925
There's a wedding in the family.
Got it?

317
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,309
We need money before we elope.

318
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:35,731
Let me arrange some money first.

319
00:17:36,631 --> 00:17:39,734
Uncle called from Naihati.

320
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:42,750
I'll get a job there.

321
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:44,912
Let me save some money and then..

322
00:17:47,884 --> 00:17:51,008
Get cutlet for me.
- Cutlet?

323
00:17:52,078 --> 00:17:53,678
I'll take you to Grand Hotel
for a treat.

324
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,797
Let everything be finalized first.

325
00:17:56,964 --> 00:17:58,424
Manda!
- Coming.

326
00:17:58,504 --> 00:17:59,274
Manda, come.

327
00:17:59,354 --> 00:18:02,572
Listen, I'll leave now.
I've to find Arjun.

328
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:05,685
Shall I go?
My darling!

329
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:11,318
They can't do any work properly.

330
00:18:11,398 --> 00:18:13,037
I'm not getting the account
details of ten boxes.

331
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,664
Look at him. he's busy pasting
labels since morning.

332
00:18:15,744 --> 00:18:16,983
He's busy sticking labels.
- It'll get done.

333
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:18,904
Hey! Where's Arjun?
- I don't know.

334
00:18:18,984 --> 00:18:19,887
Arjun!

335
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:24,049
"This life is very beautiful."

336
00:18:24,129 --> 00:18:27,291
"The world is so lovely."

337
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:35,842
"But, I don't have anyone
like you, my dear."

338
00:18:39,996 --> 00:18:43,790
"This life is very beautiful."

339
00:18:43,974 --> 00:18:47,509
"The world is so lovely."

340
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:55,582
"But, I don't have anyone
like you, my dear."

341
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:59,790
"I don't know where I'll find you."

342
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,963
"There's romance everywhere,
my dear."

343
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:11,565
"My eyes look for you
\in the lanes and cities."

344
00:19:12,095 --> 00:19:19,262
"My eyes look for you
in the lanes and cities."

345
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,583
"I don't know where I'll find you."

346
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,691
"There's romance everywhere,
my dear."

347
00:19:34,742 --> 00:19:36,774
Naskar..
- What's up?

348
00:19:36,854 --> 00:19:38,364
Where's Chorda?
- Chorda?

349
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:39,955
He went out in his bicycle.

350
00:19:40,035 --> 00:19:41,535
He went out?
- Yes.

351
00:19:57,952 --> 00:20:01,800
"I don't know
where I'm going and why."

352
00:20:02,233 --> 00:20:04,979
"My heart is lost."

353
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:10,108
"My eyes look somewhere,
my destination is elsewhere."

354
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:12,833
"Yet I'm sure to reach
my destination."

355
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:18,076
"I don't know
where I'm going and why."

356
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:21,802
"My heart is lost."

357
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:26,191
"My eyes look somewhere,
my destination is elsewhere."

358
00:20:26,271 --> 00:20:29,395
"Yet I'm sure to reach
my destination."

359
00:20:30,238 --> 00:20:33,720
"My heart races ahead.'

360
00:20:34,206 --> 00:20:37,082
"It's the season of union."

361
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,184
"I don't know where I'll find you."

362
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,811
"There's romance everywhere,
my dear."

363
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:49,422
"This life is very beautiful."

364
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:53,266
"The world is so lovely."

365
00:20:53,991 --> 00:21:01,066
"But, I don't have anyone
like you, my dear."

366
00:21:01,896 --> 00:21:05,765
"I don't know where I'll find you."

367
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:09,635
"There's romance everywhere,
my dear."

368
00:21:09,981 --> 00:21:17,270
"My eyes look for you
in the lanes and cities."

369
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:25,024
"My eyes look for you
in the lanes and cities."

370
00:21:25,921 --> 00:21:29,586
"I don't know where I'll find you."

371
00:21:29,975 --> 00:21:33,812
"There's romance everywhere,
my dear."

372
00:21:49,382 --> 00:21:50,751
Hey! Where were you all this while?

373
00:21:50,831 --> 00:21:52,200
Finally you got time to come here.

374
00:21:52,459 --> 00:21:53,767
There has been lot of problems
since morning.

375
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:55,627
Brother is scolding me as
the pandal is still incomplete.

376
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:59,400
Don't worry, uncle.
I've spoken to Bhim.

377
00:21:59,681 --> 00:22:02,038
If the pandal isn't completed
by tonight, he won't get a penny.

378
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:05,219
The wedding won't take place
if the pandal isn't finished.

379
00:22:05,576 --> 00:22:06,592
Forget about the payment.

380
00:22:07,295 --> 00:22:09,781
We've to get it done
by today by any means.

381
00:22:10,007 --> 00:22:11,596
When will the kitchen
set-up be arranged?

382
00:22:13,672 --> 00:22:16,710
What about the cook and
the cooking arrangements?

383
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:18,991
We heard that all the cards
didn't reach on time.

384
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,285
My dear son, I couldn't
practice singing properly..

385
00:22:21,365 --> 00:22:22,377
..for the last three days.

386
00:22:22,723 --> 00:22:23,891
Please look into these details.

387
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:25,556
Brother is making me go crazy.

388
00:22:25,788 --> 00:22:27,626
Arjun, come and have the oblation.

389
00:22:27,864 --> 00:22:28,858
Coming, auntie.

390
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:33,468
Hey.. who'll supervise
the pandal work?

391
00:22:33,933 --> 00:22:34,971
He's off to have oblation.

392
00:22:35,209 --> 00:22:37,349
Hey! Who is getting married?

393
00:22:37,825 --> 00:22:39,155
Your niece or Arjun's niece?

394
00:22:39,695 --> 00:22:41,047
I'm taking care of everything,
brother.

395
00:22:41,263 --> 00:22:42,679
I'm taking care of
all the arrangements.

396
00:22:43,158 --> 00:22:44,433
Everything will be fine.

397
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:48,422
There's a show in Chandannagore
next month so..

398
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:51,287
Shut up! You won't perform
in any show now.

399
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,078
Don't you care for your prestige
and reputation?

400
00:22:53,158 --> 00:22:54,472
We've a wedding in our house.

401
00:22:54,981 --> 00:22:56,786
Arjun is family.

402
00:22:56,866 --> 00:22:58,883
Don't get involved
in unnecessary things.

403
00:23:00,062 --> 00:23:02,904
Brother..
- Greetings, brother.

404
00:23:02,984 --> 00:23:04,076
Greetings.

405
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,140
I wanted to speak with you.
- Yes.

406
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,477
Yes, tell me.

407
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,363
Let's go to my chamber.

408
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:16,342
Go and tell your sister-in-law
that brother has come.

409
00:23:16,422 --> 00:23:17,877
Please come.
- Yes.

410
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:21,365
Here you are.

411
00:23:21,445 --> 00:23:23,160
I've finished offering prayers.
Come and take oblation.

412
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,057
Greetings, auntie.

413
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,111
You don't have to touch my feet,
crazy boy.

414
00:23:26,191 --> 00:23:27,095
Take this.

415
00:23:27,819 --> 00:23:29,322
Seek blessings from the deity first.

416
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,811
Hail to Lord.

417
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:39,016
Arjun, you've to go
when the wedding gifts are taken.

418
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:41,304
Manmatha won't be able to manage.
There are lots of trays.

419
00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:43,564
It'll really be helpful
if you go with him.

420
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:46,201
Did you see Saban's wedding jewelry?

421
00:23:46,482 --> 00:23:48,018
Come. I'll show you.

422
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:56,870
Wow! Lovely!

423
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,394
Sit here.
- Wonderful!

424
00:23:59,287 --> 00:24:01,124
I couldn't buy anything
for her wedding.

425
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:05,989
This set was given to her
by her grandmother.

426
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:06,919
Take a look.

427
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:10,818
And this jewelry was gifted to me
by my mother on my wedding.

428
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:11,964
How is it?

429
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:18,413
It's awesome, auntie.
Lovely!

430
00:24:19,894 --> 00:24:22,305
I'm relaxed because
you're here to help us.

431
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,283
After all it's a daughter's wedding.

432
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,472
We've to look into
so many arrangements.

433
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:27,656
Is it possible for your uncle to
singlehandedly manage everything?

434
00:24:28,236 --> 00:24:29,901
Mother, I'm going to Sapna's house.

435
00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:31,933
I'm showing him your
wedding jewelry. Come here.

436
00:24:32,301 --> 00:24:33,490
I've to go to her house.

437
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,252
Why are you roaming around?

438
00:24:35,445 --> 00:24:36,807
Tell Sapna to come here .

439
00:24:36,887 --> 00:24:38,147
How is it, Arjun?

440
00:24:39,131 --> 00:24:40,061
Super duper, auntie.

441
00:24:40,141 --> 00:24:40,720
Let me show you one more.

442
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,418
I've been invited for lunch
at Sapna's house.

443
00:24:42,861 --> 00:24:45,858
What? Your auntie Gouri traveled
a long distance to come here.

444
00:24:45,938 --> 00:24:46,702
Won't you have lunch with them?

445
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:48,550
Why did they have to come today?

446
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,107
Other friends are also going
to be at Sapna's place.

447
00:24:50,187 --> 00:24:52,183
We planned this long back.
I'm leaving.

448
00:24:53,386 --> 00:24:55,062
Arjun, try to convince her.

449
00:24:55,142 --> 00:24:57,451
She can't roam around like this.
- Wow!

450
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:58,867
Your would be husband is coming
from America tomorrow.

451
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:00,824
Go to the parlor and groom yourself.

452
00:25:00,904 --> 00:25:04,078
But instead of that you always
keep roaming around.

453
00:25:04,158 --> 00:25:06,294
We haven't bought your
wedding reception sari yet.

454
00:25:06,374 --> 00:25:09,126
I planned to go shopping
with Gouri and you.

455
00:25:09,206 --> 00:25:10,117
We don't have time.
- Why are you

456
00:25:10,197 --> 00:25:11,829
getting stressed, auntie?

457
00:25:12,105 --> 00:25:13,024
Your daughter is crazy.

458
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:14,609
We've lot of pending work.
- You can go for shopping.

459
00:25:14,689 --> 00:25:15,636
Why are you dragging me
into all this?

460
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:16,685
Who is getting married?

461
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,123
Who will wear the sari?

462
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:20,815
Arjun, talk to her.
She is grown up now.

463
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,285
Auntie, she is crazy.

464
00:25:22,707 --> 00:25:24,537
Sister-in-law, I've finished
chopping the vegetables.

465
00:25:24,617 --> 00:25:26,666
The cook won't start unless
you give him instructions.

466
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:27,866
Okay, I'll go.

467
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:30,072
Try to convince Saban, sister-in-law.

468
00:25:30,152 --> 00:25:32,872
Why did she have to go to
Sapna's house today?

469
00:25:33,225 --> 00:25:34,868
You..

470
00:25:35,181 --> 00:25:36,327
Can't you recognize him?

471
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:38,446
He's Arjun, the son of your
elder brother's friend.

472
00:25:38,526 --> 00:25:39,657
Hello, auntie.

473
00:25:39,737 --> 00:25:43,368
Don't you remember that his father
and your brother were school friends?

474
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:45,076
Yes. Now I remember.
- You can't recognize him

475
00:25:45,156 --> 00:25:46,049
as he has grown up now.

476
00:25:46,129 --> 00:25:47,595
He lives in our neighbourhood now.

477
00:25:47,675 --> 00:25:49,433
He's like family.

478
00:25:49,513 --> 00:25:51,044
He's taking care of all the details.

479
00:25:51,124 --> 00:25:51,995
Is it?
- Yes.

480
00:25:52,075 --> 00:25:55,202
Handling the pandal workers,
sending the invitations..

481
00:25:55,282 --> 00:25:56,391
Sir is calling you downstairs.

482
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,056
Saban's future in-laws are here.

483
00:25:58,136 --> 00:25:59,180
Oh! Is it?

484
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,072
Why didn't you inform me?

485
00:26:01,152 --> 00:26:02,656
Listen to me.
- Yes.

486
00:26:02,736 --> 00:26:05,467
Take out the sweets from the
refrigerator and send juice for them.

487
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:06,342
okay.

488
00:26:06,526 --> 00:26:08,883
Arjun, come down with
Saban immediately.

489
00:26:08,963 --> 00:26:09,726
Alright.
- Let's go.

490
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,984
He'll reach Kolkata tonight .

491
00:26:15,064 --> 00:26:17,038
In fact he has already
boarded the flight.

492
00:26:17,283 --> 00:26:20,754
Okay.
- He got leave so he is coming early.

493
00:26:20,834 --> 00:26:26,212
He'll come via Dubai.
- That's great.

494
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,007
We don't have enough time.

495
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,790
He'll go back after the reception.

496
00:26:32,201 --> 00:26:35,510
He'll go to Japan for a couple
of days on his way back.

497
00:26:36,341 --> 00:26:37,682
That'll also be their honeymoon.

498
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,657
But, earlier you said that he
would stay back for two weeks.

499
00:26:39,737 --> 00:26:41,138
He's very busy.

500
00:26:41,397 --> 00:26:43,743
He's always busy with work.

501
00:26:44,738 --> 00:26:47,473
When we visited him last time..

502
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:50,829
..he booked train and
bus tickets for us..

503
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,932
..and told us to go for outings
on our own.

504
00:26:54,634 --> 00:26:57,261
He was busy with his office work.

505
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:01,071
But, how can old people
like us manage alone?

506
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,693
So, we stayed at home.

507
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:04,974
He has a beautiful house.

508
00:27:05,054 --> 00:27:08,768
The locality is also very nice.
It's located atop a mountain.

509
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,535
Hello, sister.

510
00:27:12,335 --> 00:27:14,238
Please be seated.
- I'm here again.

511
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:20,703
My son wants to interact with
your daughter before the wedding.

512
00:27:20,783 --> 00:27:21,933
That's great.

513
00:27:22,013 --> 00:27:25,220
So, he's coming early.
I'm here to inform you.

514
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:27,306
That's good.
The people who are getting married..

515
00:27:27,386 --> 00:27:28,870
..should interact and get to
know each other.

516
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:33,097
They're the young generation,
you know their thoughts are different.

517
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:35,151
No. That's not bad. It's good.

518
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:38,089
Last time they couldn't
interact properly.

519
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,591
Our times were different.

520
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:40,780
We didn't see or meet each other.

521
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,180
We accepted the partner
we got on the wedding day.

522
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:49,077
Daughter-in-law! Come and sit here.

523
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:54,255
I was saying that..

524
00:27:55,531 --> 00:27:59,884
Let Nicky come here and
spend time with her in our house.

525
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:03,387
Why should they go out?

526
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:06,392
No. Let them decide this matter.
- Yes.

527
00:28:06,803 --> 00:28:09,743
Daughter-in-law, where will you
go with your fiancée?

528
00:28:10,381 --> 00:28:11,440
Anywhere he wants to go.

529
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,857
That's not done.

530
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,765
He doesn't know the city
of Kolkata well.

531
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:18,443
You've to decide on the place.
- Yes, tell him.

532
00:28:19,383 --> 00:28:20,735
A nice place.

533
00:28:21,424 --> 00:28:27,640
How about Taj Bengal?
- Yes. That's a good idea.

534
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:28,702
Nicky will love the place.

535
00:28:28,782 --> 00:28:29,880
He's right.

536
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,951
Who are you, my son?

537
00:28:33,031 --> 00:28:35,189
He's Arjun.
- Arjun?

538
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:36,659
He's like my son.

539
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:38,421
My friend's son.
- Okay.

540
00:28:38,501 --> 00:28:39,548
He lives in our neighbourhood.
- Okay.

541
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:45,872
Arjun, please go with them.

542
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:48,928
What if they face any problems?

543
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:51,955
No.. no.. my son has a
pleasant personality.

544
00:28:52,035 --> 00:28:53,123
She won't have any problem with him.

545
00:28:54,885 --> 00:28:58,401
I'll tell Nicky to come tomorrow.
- Okay.

546
00:28:59,309 --> 00:29:00,628
Around 11 in the morning.

547
00:29:00,708 --> 00:29:01,688
Okay. Fine.

548
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:06,815
Are you a Bong?
- No, actually I'm Mero, a Marwari.

549
00:29:07,582 --> 00:29:09,355
His father and I
are childhood friends.

550
00:29:09,896 --> 00:29:11,117
Both of us were students
of Hare School.

551
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:13,906
When I was in standard four
his father was in standard one.

552
00:29:13,986 --> 00:29:15,217
His father is in charge
of all the wedding arrangements.

553
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,255
Let me discuss something important.

554
00:29:20,335 --> 00:29:22,452
I'll leave now.
- Okay.

555
00:29:22,787 --> 00:29:25,522
They'll meet at 11 tomorrow morning.

556
00:29:25,602 --> 00:29:27,425
Nicky is very punctual. Got it?

557
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:30,084
Saban, you won't go out
anywhere now.

558
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,944
Arjun, don't let her go out.

559
00:29:33,349 --> 00:29:34,462
I was saying that..

560
00:29:39,673 --> 00:29:41,122
You're taking the car?
- yeah.

561
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:43,327
I want to go to South City.
I told you.

562
00:29:43,407 --> 00:29:44,840
It's okay, Neha.
You can go there in the evening.

563
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,921
What do you mean?

564
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:47,161
There's a sale going on there .

565
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:48,598
I need to pick up stuff for my friends.

566
00:29:48,678 --> 00:29:50,804
I told you.
- Do that in the evening.

567
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:52,447
What do you mean by do that
in the evening?

568
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:53,744
Look at the way you speak to me.

569
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:56,065
Every time you come to India,
you're just so rude.

570
00:29:56,875 --> 00:29:59,535
Yeah, when in Rome
be like the Romans.

571
00:29:59,615 --> 00:30:01,621
Rome? Bloody ape!

572
00:30:02,454 --> 00:30:04,324
Ape? You called me ape?

573
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,619
This ape is going to take care of you.
- No.

574
00:30:07,699 --> 00:30:09,792
Leave me. I don't like this.

575
00:30:09,965 --> 00:30:11,327
Leave me. I said leave me.
- Chote!

576
00:30:11,407 --> 00:30:12,354
Brother.

577
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:13,997
Chote..
- Yes, brother.

578
00:30:14,505 --> 00:30:15,316
Are you going out?

579
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,501
Yes, I plan to go out.

580
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,874
Okay. Do something before that.
- Yeah.

581
00:30:17,954 --> 00:30:20,977
I've spoken to the driver.
He'll take you to the decorator.

582
00:30:21,057 --> 00:30:23,464
I told him long back but he hasn't
finished the pandal yet.

583
00:30:23,544 --> 00:30:25,493
But, the pandal is going to be
constructed at their place. Right?

584
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,849
No.. that's the pandal
meant for meals.

585
00:30:28,098 --> 00:30:29,525
The wedding pandal will be built
in our premises.

586
00:30:29,605 --> 00:30:31,547
You know what they call it
in Bengali.. the 'chadnatola'.

587
00:30:31,627 --> 00:30:32,991
It'll be built here.
- okay.

588
00:30:33,413 --> 00:30:34,083
Okay?
- Sure.

589
00:30:34,163 --> 00:30:34,667
Got it.

590
00:30:34,747 --> 00:30:39,089
Brother, I'll do this work but before
that I've a meeting with a builder.

591
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:40,861
I've some work..

592
00:30:41,402 --> 00:30:42,677
Builder?

593
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:45,964
No..
- Please be seated, brother.

594
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:47,261
Be seated.
- No, its okay.

595
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:48,526
Please be seated.
- No, it's okay.

596
00:30:48,606 --> 00:30:49,834
What do you want to say?

597
00:30:50,532 --> 00:30:53,321
The matter is that I've been
planning for a long time..

598
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:56,878
..to start a business in Kolkata.

599
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,219
Business?
- Yes.

600
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,651
Real estate is the
in thing these days.

601
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,973
I wish we could get a
small property.

602
00:31:04,373 --> 00:31:06,232
So well..
- No.. that's okay..

603
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:09,735
But what about your job in America?

604
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:11,234
Brother, that is there.

605
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:24,927
Will Dolly take care
of the building business?

606
00:31:25,007 --> 00:31:27,507
No. No, brother.
It's not building. It's real estate.

607
00:31:27,775 --> 00:31:29,284
Actually..
- I've a great business plan

608
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:30,759
in my mind.

609
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:35,234
If I get a space of around1500-200
square feet in any complex..

610
00:31:35,314 --> 00:31:36,869
..we can start a restaurant.

611
00:31:36,949 --> 00:31:40,231
A vegetarian restaurant.
Pasta. Burger. Macaroni.

612
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:42,490
We can have an all American
vegetarian restaurant..

613
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,825
..for the first time in Calcutta.
It's going to be brilliant.

614
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:47,982
And restaurant business
is highly profitable.

615
00:31:48,062 --> 00:31:50,087
We'll earn in cash, brother.
Isn't it, Navin?

616
00:31:51,158 --> 00:31:53,309
No.. if you want to get into business...

617
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:55,158
..then you can get involved
in the family business.

618
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:58,008
You deal in fireworks, brother.

619
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:02,808
I don't think Dolly can handle that.

620
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:07,013
And in any case the noise pollution
act is coming down the pipe.

621
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:08,601
That's going to be very hard.

622
00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:13,606
So, what's the future of fireworks?

623
00:32:14,644 --> 00:32:18,244
As far as Ganesh Talkies is
concerned..

624
00:32:18,324 --> 00:32:19,895
..I think we're done.

625
00:32:19,975 --> 00:32:22,543
I think we should sell it to
somebody like Inox.

626
00:32:22,926 --> 00:32:24,905
Multiplexes are ruling the roost,
brother.

627
00:32:25,553 --> 00:32:26,462
Please understand.

628
00:32:26,542 --> 00:32:29,119
No.. Dolly, are you going to cook?

629
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,578
No, brother.

630
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:31,973
We'll hire cooks.

631
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:33,746
We'll have a staff of 10-12.

632
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:37,144
Okay. I can't understand
anything right now.

633
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:40,491
We'll discuss it later. Okay?

634
00:32:40,571 --> 00:32:41,853
You're going to be here
for a month. Isn't it?

635
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:44,231
Yes, brother. Don't worry about it.

636
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:46,735
Don't forget to speak
with the decorator. Okay?

637
00:32:46,815 --> 00:32:48,433
Absolutely. Not a problem.

638
00:32:48,513 --> 00:32:49,644
Chaya!

639
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:53,910
You should've told him
the whole truth.

640
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,147
What are you waiting for?
- All in good time. Yeah.

641
00:32:56,227 --> 00:32:59,347
All in good time.
Let me handle this.

642
00:32:59,427 --> 00:33:00,948
Please, Navin. Please leave me.

643
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:02,483
Please don't trouble me.

644
00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:05,121
Go and finish your job quickly..
- Listen..

645
00:33:05,201 --> 00:33:06,948
..and send the car for me.
- Calm down. what are you..

646
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,581
Listen.. I need my own car.

647
00:33:11,256 --> 00:33:13,667
Pravin Agarwal's brother, Navin.

648
00:33:14,196 --> 00:33:15,850
He lives in America
with his wife Dolly.

649
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:18,358
His manners are westernized.

650
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:21,321
But he forgets everything
during the winters.

651
00:33:21,853 --> 00:33:23,874
He takes leave and comes to
Kolkata with his wife.

652
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,482
Do you know what the people
in the neighbourhood address him as?

653
00:33:28,562 --> 00:33:30,285
Jack da.

654
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:34,573
Jack dada, you need to start a
business to stay in Kolkata.

655
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,411
And I need the house.

656
00:33:37,192 --> 00:33:39,376
Try to convince Pashupati Ghosh.

657
00:33:39,592 --> 00:33:41,646
Please try to convince
your elder brother if possible.

658
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:42,997
Talk to them personally.

659
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,086
But, this matter needs to be
sorted out by next month.

660
00:33:48,243 --> 00:33:51,530
I'm ready to give them a
penthouse in Rajarhat..

661
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:52,686
..on the terrace.

662
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:54,903
The entire thing.

663
00:34:02,358 --> 00:34:04,510
If we get that house

664
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:07,517
then I'll give you
the top floor of the shopping mall..

665
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:10,361
..run your restaurant,
full ownership.

666
00:34:11,831 --> 00:34:12,858
I hear you, my friend.

667
00:34:13,075 --> 00:34:15,832
But, brother and Pashupati da
are childhood friends.

668
00:34:18,113 --> 00:34:20,081
I've seen many such friendships.

669
00:34:20,675 --> 00:34:22,945
'Friendship and love for each other.'

670
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,154
Mr. Pravin tried to remake a film on
friendship but it flopped terribly.

671
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:29,900
Nobody cares for such
emotions these days.

672
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:31,965
Cinema.

673
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:35,330
Let me ask you something?

674
00:34:35,935 --> 00:34:37,762
Have you ever planned to make films?

675
00:34:40,097 --> 00:34:41,665
I do many things, bro.

676
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:45,899
Nowadays it's not enough to
survive on one business.

677
00:34:46,612 --> 00:34:49,758
The main mantra of business
is diversity.

678
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:53,726
Today I'm into one business,
tomorrow it may be something else.

679
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:55,574
The one that will do well will
stay and that doesn't work..

680
00:34:55,654 --> 00:34:56,785
..will be thrown out.

681
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:01,401
Use and thrown.
- Really? Use and throw. Right?

682
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:03,369
Cinema is also use and throw?

683
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,225
Why do you want to resign
from your lucrative job..

684
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:07,538
..in America and settle down here?
- Why?

685
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,679
Well, I..

686
00:35:10,003 --> 00:35:16,119
Because Kolkata is market now.
Right now a growing city.

687
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:20,216
There are political disturbances..

688
00:35:20,476 --> 00:35:22,249
..yet I want to do business here.

689
00:35:23,232 --> 00:35:25,381
Land is cheap, labour is cheap.

690
00:35:26,138 --> 00:35:28,960
I'll shift when the market and
opportunities shift elsewhere.

691
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,583
Man-market. Did you think of it?

692
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,070
Not really. I..

693
00:35:35,773 --> 00:35:37,946
You understand and know everything.

694
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:41,765
I've such connections that
I can pressurize Pashupati..

695
00:35:41,845 --> 00:35:44,392
..in such a way that
he will be helpless.

696
00:35:45,754 --> 00:35:48,435
But, you're a gentleman.

697
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:52,820
The goons can't work the way you can.

698
00:35:54,226 --> 00:35:55,393
Ganesh..
- yes.

699
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:57,577
He'll help you with
whatever you need.

700
00:35:58,207 --> 00:35:59,396
Start the work today itself.

701
00:36:00,142 --> 00:36:01,926
Sir..
- Yes.

702
00:36:03,234 --> 00:36:04,445
Good luck.
- Thank you.

703
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:07,621
C'mon, scoundrel. Come on.

704
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,600
You trouble us every day. Come.

705
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,731
Leave me. Please leave me.
- Come.

706
00:36:12,811 --> 00:36:14,313
Don't speak a word. Shut up.

707
00:36:16,269 --> 00:36:17,739
Please leave me.

708
00:36:17,819 --> 00:36:19,079
My glasses..

709
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:29,644
Sir.. sir.. sir, please forgive me.
I'm very poor.

710
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:32,433
"The mood isn't good."

711
00:36:32,866 --> 00:36:36,098
"That's why my heart is beating fast.'

712
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,419
"The mood isn't good."

713
00:36:39,744 --> 00:36:42,771
"That's why my heart is beating fast.'

714
00:36:50,302 --> 00:36:53,178
"Everybody is looting people."

715
00:36:53,664 --> 00:36:56,564
"But you survive
on petty tamarind seeds."

716
00:36:57,083 --> 00:37:03,353
"It makes your mouth sour
and makes your heart beat fast.'"

717
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:07,037
"You mistook a chili for a
lemon and took a bite."

718
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:10,395
"It was too spicy for you,
but I loved it."

719
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:13,780
"It was too spicy for you,
but I loved it."

720
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,250
"It was too spicy for you,
but I loved it."

721
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:21,081
"It was too spicy for you,
but I loved it."

722
00:37:21,161 --> 00:37:23,711
"The mood isn't good."

723
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:27,278
"That's why my heart is beating fast.'

724
00:37:28,003 --> 00:37:31,149
"Everybody is looting people."

725
00:37:31,443 --> 00:37:34,686
"I'm busy eating
petty tamarind seeds."

726
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,800
"It makes the mouth sour."

727
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:41,389
"It makes the heart beat fast."

728
00:37:41,695 --> 00:37:44,645
"I mistook a chili for a lemon
and took a bite."

729
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:48,058
"It was too spicy for me,
but you loved it."

730
00:37:48,138 --> 00:37:51,550
"It was too spicy for me,
but you loved it."

731
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:54,956
"It was too spicy for me,
but you loved it."

732
00:37:55,036 --> 00:37:58,863
"It was too spicy for me,
but you loved it."

733
00:38:15,973 --> 00:38:22,524
"If you want to enjoy
something you must choose."

734
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,738
"Right now
I just wish to romance you."

735
00:38:25,818 --> 00:38:32,722
"Just romance."

736
00:38:33,135 --> 00:38:36,129
"As your mouth waters
it gives me strength."

737
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:39,509
"It was too spicy for you,
but I loved it."

738
00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:43,001
"It was too spicy for you,
but I loved it."

739
00:38:43,081 --> 00:38:46,353
"It was too spicy for you,
but I loved it."

740
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:50,238
"It was too spicy for you,
but I loved it."

741
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:10,202
"The mood isn't good."

742
00:39:10,602 --> 00:39:13,445
"That's why my heart
is beating fast.'

743
00:39:14,278 --> 00:39:15,416
"Silly thoughts disturb me."

744
00:39:15,496 --> 00:39:17,686
"Where were you all this while?"
- "Silly!"

745
00:39:17,766 --> 00:39:21,027
"Why did you come close
after so long?"

746
00:39:21,107 --> 00:39:25,802
"Now that you're here,
you've to romance with me."

747
00:39:25,882 --> 00:39:31,261
"Only romance."

748
00:39:31,341 --> 00:39:34,353
"As my mouth waters
it gives you strength."

749
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:37,635
"It was too spicy for me,
but you loved it."

750
00:39:37,715 --> 00:39:41,181
"It was too spicy for me,
but you loved it."

751
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:44,705
"It was too spicy for me,
but you loved it."

752
00:39:44,785 --> 00:39:48,483
"It was too spicy for me,
but you loved it."

753
00:39:48,563 --> 00:39:51,855
"Everybody is looting people."

754
00:39:51,935 --> 00:39:55,152
"You're busy eating tamarind seeds."

755
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:58,557
"It makes the mouth sour."

756
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,498
"It makes the heart beat fast."

757
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:05,330
"I mistook a chili for a
lemon and took a bite."

758
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:06,887
"It was too spicy for you.."

759
00:40:06,967 --> 00:40:08,628
"But you loved it."

760
00:40:08,708 --> 00:40:10,379
'It was too spicy for me."

761
00:40:10,459 --> 00:40:12,130
"But, I loved it."

762
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,781
"It was too spicy for you.."

763
00:40:13,861 --> 00:40:15,597
"But I loved it."

764
00:40:15,677 --> 00:40:17,348
"It was too spicy for me."

765
00:40:17,428 --> 00:40:20,040
"But, I loved it."

766
00:40:24,283 --> 00:40:30,381
Chaya said that she'll give her
diamond set to Saban.

767
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:32,560
This is not done. Right?

768
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:34,454
She told me about it today.

769
00:40:34,973 --> 00:40:39,288
I refused to accept it but
she was not ready to listen to me.

770
00:40:39,496 --> 00:40:41,130
She kept saying that Saban
is also her daughter.

771
00:40:41,652 --> 00:40:43,848
She may be like her daughter
but I can't accept..

772
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,798
..such an expensive jewelry set.

773
00:40:47,811 --> 00:40:49,290
She's not giving it to you.

774
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:53,104
She's gifting it to Saban.
- So what?

775
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:55,759
Brother Pravin is bearing
all the wedding expenses.

776
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,348
How can I accept the diamond set
from her after all this?

777
00:40:57,687 --> 00:41:00,291
Isn't it embarrassing?
- I don't have any such feelings.

778
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,436
Yes, I can see that.

779
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:04,702
I'm really surprised.

780
00:41:05,531 --> 00:41:07,451
Will you ever be able to return
the money brother Pravin..

781
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:08,765
..is spending on the wedding?

782
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:10,737
I won't.

783
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:15,020
I don't have anything to say.

784
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,143
Don't say anything.

785
00:41:19,051 --> 00:41:21,542
Chaya is more than a sister to me.

786
00:41:22,842 --> 00:41:24,667
Yet she's gifting her
an expensive diamond set..

787
00:41:25,264 --> 00:41:27,244
I can't accept it.

788
00:41:27,832 --> 00:41:30,193
When I was in fourth standard
he was in first standard.

789
00:41:32,585 --> 00:41:34,029
Pravin never brought lunch from home.

790
00:41:35,249 --> 00:41:38,328
His father's business was
on the verge of collapsing.

791
00:41:40,378 --> 00:41:43,293
I would carry two lunch boxes
to school.

792
00:41:45,325 --> 00:41:46,666
One vegetarian and
the other one non-vegetarian.

793
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:50,199
Mother would cook for him.

794
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,603
This went on for months.

795
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:57,241
Every evening he would come
to our house on the pretext..

796
00:41:57,829 --> 00:42:00,302
..of doing homework
and feast on delicacies.

797
00:42:00,674 --> 00:42:02,612
Mother would cook
vegetarian meal separately for him.

798
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:05,433
When we would go for outings..

799
00:42:05,513 --> 00:42:07,967
..father would make Pravin sit
in the front sit next to him.

800
00:42:10,182 --> 00:42:13,330
He taught Pravin how to drive a car.

801
00:42:15,846 --> 00:42:19,558
I learned it from him
but after many years.

802
00:42:21,608 --> 00:42:23,424
Blood relations aren't
always important.

803
00:42:24,888 --> 00:42:26,237
Don't you see how Manmatha is?

804
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:28,425
He's an idiot.

805
00:42:31,135 --> 00:42:32,312
He's rehearsing again.

806
00:42:32,467 --> 00:42:33,375
He'll make me crazy.

807
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:39,684
Will you stop?

808
00:42:40,272 --> 00:42:42,184
He's disturbing everybody
in the neighbourhood.

809
00:42:43,913 --> 00:42:45,366
He's irritating.

810
00:42:45,446 --> 00:42:47,505
He thinks he's a great singer.

811
00:42:48,041 --> 00:42:48,906
Disgusting!

812
00:43:02,083 --> 00:43:08,191
What will we do in this huge
house after Saban's wedding?

813
00:43:12,087 --> 00:43:13,493
Well, I wanted to say..

814
00:43:15,233 --> 00:43:18,898
..Mr. Sharma promised to give you

815
00:43:20,704 --> 00:43:27,293
the top floor flat
in a complex in Rajarhat

816
00:43:29,715 --> 00:43:33,585
Four bedrooms. One prayer room.

817
00:43:34,591 --> 00:43:37,823
We can also have a garden
on the terrace if we want to.

818
00:43:39,627 --> 00:43:42,924
Do you know what everybody says?
There's no pollution in Rajarhat?

819
00:43:43,502 --> 00:43:44,724
It's full of greenery.

820
00:43:46,682 --> 00:43:50,477
There's going to be a
swimming pool in that complex.

821
00:43:53,785 --> 00:43:55,688
Do you want to wear
swimming costume at this age?

822
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,547
Don't divert the topic.

823
00:43:57,929 --> 00:43:59,972
Have you seen the condition
of the bathroom in our house?

824
00:44:00,859 --> 00:44:02,588
It's infested with lizards
and cockroaches.

825
00:44:02,668 --> 00:44:05,475
It's so slippery that anybody will fall
and have a fracture any day.

826
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:09,826
Everything is made of marble there.

827
00:44:11,345 --> 00:44:13,572
There's going to be a bathtub
in the bathroom.

828
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:17,556
We'll get to meet many people there.

829
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:22,702
There's a park right in front
of that complex.

830
00:44:22,782 --> 00:44:24,875
We can go there for evening walks.

831
00:44:25,048 --> 00:44:26,518
Don't you wish to live a life like this?

832
00:44:27,135 --> 00:44:29,197
If you don't go for walks
at this age, then when will you?

833
00:44:30,635 --> 00:44:34,354
Listen.. please listen to me..

834
00:44:34,862 --> 00:44:38,919
If you agree we can
shift there next year.

835
00:44:39,481 --> 00:44:43,416
Please call Mr. Sharma
and speak with him.

836
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:48,991
I won't say a word on this topic.

837
00:44:49,672 --> 00:44:51,358
Live in this haunted
dilapidated house.

838
00:44:51,575 --> 00:44:53,099
I hate talking to you.

839
00:44:53,402 --> 00:44:55,567
I'll go to America after
Saban's wedding.

840
00:44:57,794 --> 00:44:59,372
In swimming costume.

841
00:45:04,777 --> 00:45:06,474
Slowly.

842
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,209
Did you drink milk?
- Yes.

843
00:45:12,355 --> 00:45:13,761
Look at this Manda.

844
00:45:14,933 --> 00:45:16,284
Look at this.

845
00:45:16,663 --> 00:45:17,560
I was talking about it.

846
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,376
Isn't it beautiful?
- It's beautiful.

847
00:45:19,906 --> 00:45:22,392
Red one is beautiful.
- I saw a same one in the market.

848
00:45:22,472 --> 00:45:24,122
This must be very expensive.

849
00:45:24,202 --> 00:45:26,241
Yes, it will be.

850
00:45:26,915 --> 00:45:31,888
You didn't answer my questions.
- What?

851
00:45:33,218 --> 00:45:35,661
What have you decided about Arjun?

852
00:45:35,973 --> 00:45:40,600
What is he going to do?
- What?

853
00:45:41,465 --> 00:45:43,627
He'll be fine.
- But how?

854
00:45:44,513 --> 00:45:46,049
He has a future.

855
00:45:47,228 --> 00:45:51,304
I also have dreams
and desires. Isn't it?

856
00:45:52,071 --> 00:45:53,520
A new bride will come home.

857
00:45:53,822 --> 00:45:55,314
She'll roam around in the house
all decked up.

858
00:45:57,036 --> 00:45:58,268
Do something.

859
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,852
Sell Ganesh Talkies to Mr. Sharma.

860
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,322
They'll build a multiplex
or a mall there.

861
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:06,089
Yes, and he'll be
the mall's manager.

862
00:46:06,738 --> 00:46:08,727
He won't even get the job
of a security guard.

863
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:11,941
I'll take him to my office.

864
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:15,108
He'll help me in the business
after marriage.

865
00:46:15,508 --> 00:46:17,065
No, he won't.

866
00:46:18,322 --> 00:46:19,770
How can you plan such things?

867
00:46:20,019 --> 00:46:22,051
Even his father will do it.

868
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:25,219
Leave it.

869
00:46:28,631 --> 00:46:32,340
Look, I know Arjun very well.

870
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:36,059
He's not interested in business.

871
00:46:36,646 --> 00:46:39,586
He has been interested
in music since childhood.

872
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:42,505
He bought a guitar for
himself and you..

873
00:46:44,851 --> 00:46:49,016
Look, everyone is not meant
for jobs or business.

874
00:46:49,805 --> 00:46:50,778
Do something.

875
00:46:51,037 --> 00:46:52,553
Sell Ganesh Talkies.

876
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:55,451
Send him to Mumbai
that you'll get after selling it.

877
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,245
What's the harm if he makes
a name for himself there?

878
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:03,009
He may become a renowned singer.

879
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:06,033
There are many schools
in Mumbai offering..

880
00:47:06,113 --> 00:47:09,776
..music, dancing and acting lessons..
- Stop reading Filmfare magazine.

881
00:47:11,052 --> 00:47:12,068
Why?

882
00:47:12,291 --> 00:47:13,988
Don't you wish that
your son does well in life?

883
00:47:14,068 --> 00:47:15,188
Will he become
the next Kishore Kumar?

884
00:47:15,268 --> 00:47:16,864
He can.

885
00:47:21,742 --> 00:47:26,488
Many young girls and boys appear
on the television shows..

886
00:47:26,568 --> 00:47:27,644
Tell me the name of the shows..

887
00:47:27,724 --> 00:47:28,455
Sa Re Ga Ma..
- Yes.

888
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:29,526
Indian Idol.
- Yes.

889
00:47:29,606 --> 00:47:33,158
Hey you, get out.
- Go.

890
00:47:34,718 --> 00:47:39,193
Arjun can become a junior
artist and nothing else.

891
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:43,293
Don't you feel ashamed of
doubting your son's abilities?

892
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,363
After all he's your son.
- Yes.

893
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:48,342
I'm saying this because he's my son.

894
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:51,501
I know what he's capable of.

895
00:47:52,841 --> 00:47:54,128
He wants to be a singer.

896
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:57,155
People have to struggle
a lot in the film industry.

897
00:47:57,235 --> 00:47:58,658
He'll have to struggle more than me.

898
00:47:58,738 --> 00:48:00,219
Then let him sell crackers.

899
00:48:00,619 --> 00:48:02,283
Yes, he'll sell crackers.

900
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:04,781
I sell crackers.
My father sold crackers.

901
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:05,981
My grandfather sold crackers.

902
00:48:06,061 --> 00:48:08,208
The money we earn comes
after selling crackers.

903
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,591
Cracker seller?

904
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:12,264
Why did he invest so much
money in such a terrible film?

905
00:48:12,344 --> 00:48:14,610
The film wasn't bad.
- Yes, it was.

906
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,956
It was a remake of a famous film.

907
00:48:17,036 --> 00:48:18,351
It was a classical film.

908
00:48:18,826 --> 00:48:19,929
The director wasn't good.

909
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:24,751
Hire a good director
and make a nice film.

910
00:48:25,032 --> 00:48:27,680
Give Arjun the chance to
sing in that film.

911
00:48:28,902 --> 00:48:31,741
People don't join family
business anymore. Got it?

912
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,854
Status also matters these days.

913
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:37,708
Stop reading Stardust magazine.

914
00:48:37,979 --> 00:48:39,903
Why are you blaming the magazines?

915
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,620
Hi! How do you do?
- Hi!

916
00:48:47,291 --> 00:48:49,237
So, where do you want to go?

917
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,040
How about Park Hotel?
- Cool.

918
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,323
But, you've to give the directions.
- Sure. He will.

919
00:48:55,231 --> 00:48:56,734
Hi! Sorry, I didn't get your name.

920
00:48:56,814 --> 00:49:00,309
Hi! Arjun.
- Hi, Arjun, I'm Nicky Banerjee.

921
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,195
Arjun Agarwal. Nicky Banerjee.
- Right. Nice to meet you.

922
00:49:03,275 --> 00:49:04,146
Okay.

923
00:49:06,492 --> 00:49:07,810
Yeah. Right.

924
00:49:08,027 --> 00:49:09,281
Welcome to India.

925
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:11,938
Thanks a lot.

926
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:14,014
Please.

927
00:49:14,976 --> 00:49:15,852
Okay.

928
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:26,302
Please. Please.

929
00:49:29,361 --> 00:49:30,496
So..

930
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:33,104
yeah..

931
00:49:34,606 --> 00:49:36,498
So see.. it's like this.

932
00:49:37,093 --> 00:49:38,660
We haven't really met.

933
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,077
We don't know each other.

934
00:49:40,552 --> 00:49:43,398
I was thinking that we should
get to know each other..

935
00:49:43,755 --> 00:49:45,257
you know before the wedding.

936
00:49:45,528 --> 00:49:47,193
It'll make things really easy.

937
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:49,074
You know ease the tension
and everything.

938
00:49:49,357 --> 00:49:51,898
We can talk to each other
over a cup of coffee you know.

939
00:49:51,978 --> 00:49:52,882
Get to know each other.

940
00:49:53,325 --> 00:49:56,287
You can talk about what you like.
I can talk about what I like and..

941
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,695
What do you think?

942
00:49:58,171 --> 00:49:59,944
Who should start? You or I me?

943
00:50:00,268 --> 00:50:01,274
Cool. I'll start.

944
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:05,133
You know I've been pretty much
all over the place.

945
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,244
I grew up here.

946
00:50:07,324 --> 00:50:09,817
I was in Xavier's
till class 6 in Kolkata.

947
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:13,625
I've been pretty much
independent after that.

948
00:50:13,705 --> 00:50:15,527
So, I went to the States
to my maternal uncle's place.

949
00:50:15,607 --> 00:50:16,944
I was in Minisodore High School.

950
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:18,522
And then I moved to New York.

951
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:19,981
I stayed in the hostel
for a couple of years.

952
00:50:20,061 --> 00:50:21,415
And then.. I studied law. Right?

953
00:50:21,495 --> 00:50:23,047
So, I went to Boston

954
00:50:23,127 --> 00:50:25,307
I was in Harvard Law School.
Did my GD there.

955
00:50:26,215 --> 00:50:27,902
I don't know,
I've been really lucky you know.

956
00:50:27,982 --> 00:50:30,573
I was picked up by this
biggest law firm in NY and..

957
00:50:31,146 --> 00:50:33,730
..it's actually the biggest law firm
in New York.

958
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,189
I work there.

959
00:50:36,335 --> 00:50:39,938
I don't know, I guess if everything
goes fine for the next 5-6 years..

960
00:50:40,018 --> 00:50:41,549
..I'm going to move to Washington.

961
00:50:42,121 --> 00:50:44,997
That's what I want but I really
like upstate New York you know.

962
00:50:45,311 --> 00:50:46,230
The drive..

963
00:50:46,525 --> 00:50:47,606
Thanks.

964
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:51,887
You know if you drive from
New York to Boston through..

965
00:50:51,967 --> 00:50:53,822
..New England territory
it's really pretty.

966
00:50:53,902 --> 00:50:55,526
It's amazing.
The drive is awesome.

967
00:50:55,606 --> 00:50:59,007
And you're going to love it there,
I can tell you that. But..

968
00:50:59,288 --> 00:51:00,575
Cappuccino for ma'am.
- You know..

969
00:51:00,655 --> 00:51:01,699
Thanks.

970
00:51:02,856 --> 00:51:07,521
I mean no offence meant but Kolkata
is really noisy and polluted right..

971
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:09,553
I mean
- Whisky?

972
00:51:09,633 --> 00:51:12,180
Hey!
- Sorry.. sorry, sir.

973
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,456
Oh wow!

974
00:51:14,829 --> 00:51:18,008
Yeah, so.. you know
you will love it there..

975
00:51:18,088 --> 00:51:19,813
..though you won't get
too much time.

976
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:22,116
I mean ask me, I work really hard.

977
00:51:22,656 --> 00:51:24,864
I don't get time to watch TV
for example.

978
00:51:24,944 --> 00:51:27,610
I love my movies
but I just don't get the time.

979
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:30,605
Though frankly, I must tell you.

980
00:51:30,685 --> 00:51:32,735
I hate Bollywood, you know.

981
00:51:32,815 --> 00:51:34,800
The whole song and
dance routine gets to me.

982
00:51:34,995 --> 00:51:36,779
It's like a bloody circus. Right?

983
00:51:37,297 --> 00:51:40,024
Anyway, so I keep up,
I try to keep in shape , you know..

984
00:51:40,104 --> 00:51:41,375
I go to the gym regularly

985
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:43,667
I swim regularly.

986
00:51:43,948 --> 00:51:44,856
I like jazz.

987
00:51:45,483 --> 00:51:47,010
George Clooney is
my favourite actor.

988
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,442
My favourite city is Paris.

989
00:51:49,522 --> 00:51:51,001
My favourite author is
John Steinbeck.

990
00:51:51,081 --> 00:51:53,887
And.. oh I love fish.

991
00:51:54,774 --> 00:51:56,950
You know I absolutely
dig fish you know.

992
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,858
Anything remotely fishy
and I'm going to lap it up.

993
00:51:59,938 --> 00:52:02,798
I mean sea fish,
river fish, everything.

994
00:52:02,878 --> 00:52:04,308
Freshwater, everything.

995
00:52:04,388 --> 00:52:06,059
I can't cook so.

996
00:52:06,254 --> 00:52:08,719
So, I kind of hoping you can get
there with me and rustle up..

997
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:11,583
..something jolly good
Bengali food you know.

998
00:52:13,272 --> 00:52:14,202
What else?
Yeah!

999
00:52:14,282 --> 00:52:16,677
I don't smoke. I drink occasionally.

1000
00:52:16,757 --> 00:52:18,634
I prefer wine. Californian wine.

1001
00:52:18,714 --> 00:52:20,537
It's really good.
You must try it some time.

1002
00:52:20,893 --> 00:52:22,980
Not whisky like my friend.

1003
00:52:23,689 --> 00:52:28,889
And yeah.. that's it.
that's pretty much..

1004
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:31,202
Oh! one more thing.

1005
00:52:33,392 --> 00:52:36,754
You're really beautiful Sharbani,
I must tell you that.

1006
00:52:37,565 --> 00:52:38,566
And don't mind my saying so

1007
00:52:38,646 --> 00:52:40,727
but I think you look pretty
awesome in a sari.

1008
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,100
Right?

1009
00:52:43,095 --> 00:52:44,100
Yeah. That's it.

1010
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:45,630
Your turn.

1011
00:52:49,306 --> 00:52:50,257
Well,

1012
00:52:52,311 --> 00:52:54,074
I simply dig my cigarettes.

1013
00:52:55,328 --> 00:52:56,765
Marijuana too some times.

1014
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:02,138
I hate my saris.
I think jazz is boring.

1015
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,549
George Clooney is too boring.

1016
00:53:04,844 --> 00:53:07,947
I mean I don't want to settle down
in a city, state or country..

1017
00:53:08,027 --> 00:53:09,687
..where I don't have roots in.

1018
00:53:09,767 --> 00:53:11,568
It's like feeling like a
tourist all the time.

1019
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,018
And I don't think I want to settle
down with someone who thinks..

1020
00:53:14,098 --> 00:53:16,083
..he can get to know me
over a cup of coffee.

1021
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:18,151
And I'm definitely not going
to rustle up any fish..

1022
00:53:18,231 --> 00:53:21,361
..for any Harvard law school
mamma's boy who's not ready..

1023
00:53:21,441 --> 00:53:24,702
..to look beyond the dirt
and pollution of Calcutta..

1024
00:53:24,782 --> 00:53:26,875
..and see its culture heritage
and beauty.

1025
00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:28,947
Yup! That's it.

1026
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:32,655
I'm sorry. Am I missing something?
I didn't get you.

1027
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:34,179
She won't marry you.

1028
00:53:35,251 --> 00:53:36,343
No?

1029
00:53:36,862 --> 00:53:37,899
No.

1030
00:53:38,851 --> 00:53:41,899
Then who will she marry?
- Marry me.

1031
00:53:43,856 --> 00:53:44,732
Probably.

1032
00:53:47,874 --> 00:53:49,365
What is going on? I don't get this.

1033
00:53:49,819 --> 00:53:50,792
Exactly that's the point.

1034
00:53:50,872 --> 00:53:52,360
We're here to explain
the point to you..

1035
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:53,495
..so that you get it.

1036
00:53:54,284 --> 00:53:57,400
No.. is this sort of a freaking joke
because it's not funny. What

1037
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,552
No.. we're not joking.
Of course not.

1038
00:53:59,632 --> 00:54:01,033
See, the thing is..

1039
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:03,768
I'm Arjun Agarwal. Sharbani Ghosh.

1040
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:08,838
Something was going on
between us for long.

1041
00:54:08,918 --> 00:54:09,887
What do you mean?

1042
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:11,714
Your whisky, sir.
- Thank you.

1043
00:54:11,794 --> 00:54:12,730
What do you mean?

1044
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:15,489
We're having an affair. Okay?

1045
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:18,571
I haven't shared it with
my family and nor has she..

1046
00:54:18,651 --> 00:54:22,181
..because the problem is her father
and my father are childhood friends.

1047
00:54:22,261 --> 00:54:23,198
Like brothers.

1048
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:27,609
Now, how will the brothers
become relative..

1049
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:29,674
.that's where the freaking
problem is.

1050
00:54:30,301 --> 00:54:32,928
That's where you come.
- What..

1051
00:54:33,285 --> 00:54:36,280
See, you are the main guy
in this plot.

1052
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,627
The main character, boss.
- Just cut the crap please.

1053
00:54:38,707 --> 00:54:39,719
That's enough.

1054
00:54:40,768 --> 00:54:43,149
What's going on Sharbani?
I'm sorry, I don't get this.

1055
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:44,587
After progressing so much..

1056
00:54:44,667 --> 00:54:46,003
..are you playing a prank on me?

1057
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:48,122
I mean everyone knows that
I'm getting married.

1058
00:54:48,202 --> 00:54:50,565
All the arrangements have been made.
The reception is organized and..

1059
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:53,794
The wedding invitation cards
have also been sent out.

1060
00:54:54,313 --> 00:54:58,146
Do you want somebody to take leave
from New York from a firm..

1061
00:54:58,226 --> 00:55:00,081
..and hurl all his ass
all the way to Kolkata?

1062
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:03,368
Do you've any freaking idea
how much a business ticket costs?

1063
00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:04,568
Of course.

1064
00:55:05,032 --> 00:55:07,378
When you come via London
the ticket costs 500 bucks.

1065
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:08,546
You pay 500 dollars.

1066
00:55:08,853 --> 00:55:09,945
From Dubai it cost 250 dollars.

1067
00:55:10,313 --> 00:55:11,426
You're the one who buys the 250 one.

1068
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:13,080
And what are you talking about?
- What?

1069
00:55:13,361 --> 00:55:16,940
Did you pay 250 dollars
for the ticket or not?

1070
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:18,778
We have provisions for that.

1071
00:55:19,875 --> 00:55:22,556
There are 500 dollars
for you in there.

1072
00:55:23,204 --> 00:55:24,329
Two way ticket. Right?

1073
00:55:24,804 --> 00:55:27,345
No.. screw the tickets, Sharbani..
I mean why..

1074
00:55:27,637 --> 00:55:29,598
Why after all the arrangements?

1075
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:30,874
The first thing you
remembered was the fare..

1076
00:55:30,954 --> 00:55:32,485
..of your flight tickets. Right?

1077
00:55:32,701 --> 00:55:33,566
No.. no.. screw the ticket.

1078
00:55:33,646 --> 00:55:35,469
I don't give a flying thing
about the ticket.

1079
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:37,133
But, you could've told me earlier,
Sharbani.

1080
00:55:37,213 --> 00:55:38,885
I wouldn't have come.
I wouldn't have had to take leave.

1081
00:55:38,965 --> 00:55:41,033
I wouldn't have come.
- This is not so easy.

1082
00:55:41,113 --> 00:55:42,038
We need you.

1083
00:55:42,118 --> 00:55:43,951
Listen..
- We need you and so you had to come.

1084
00:55:44,031 --> 00:55:45,119
Listen, please get out of this.
Please.

1085
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:46,914
It's none of your business
and you're getting on my nerves.

1086
00:55:46,994 --> 00:55:49,970
Let me finish.
We need you, friend.

1087
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:50,889
You must come.

1088
00:55:50,969 --> 00:55:52,969
You must come, friend.
- Why?

1089
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:54,316
Why? how do I..

1090
00:55:54,716 --> 00:55:56,380
I need you.
I'm the story-teller.

1091
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,930
I'm trying to explain.
Please try to understand.

1092
00:55:58,319 --> 00:55:59,875
What story are you talking about.

1093
00:55:59,955 --> 00:56:02,632
See.. her family,
my family going through lot of shit..

1094
00:56:02,712 --> 00:56:03,396
There is lot of problem.

1095
00:56:03,476 --> 00:56:05,688
We're unable to tell them
about our affair. Got it?

1096
00:56:06,044 --> 00:56:07,407
So, we were waiting for you.

1097
00:56:07,487 --> 00:56:10,693
You'll come and meet her
father and explain it to him.

1098
00:56:10,773 --> 00:56:13,735
You'll say that
you don't like the girl.

1099
00:56:13,815 --> 00:56:15,605
'I don't like her.
She's not fit for me.'

1100
00:56:15,778 --> 00:56:18,578
'She's not modern. She wears
weird clothes. This and that.'

1101
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:20,935
You came here
from America for a girl.

1102
00:56:21,015 --> 00:56:24,267
You're here for a girl
whom you can marry.

1103
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:26,775
She's not the one for you, man.
You just have to tell him that.

1104
00:56:26,855 --> 00:56:27,986
It's just that.

1105
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:33,175
But.. but the catch is..
you've to go with a very decent..

1106
00:56:33,478 --> 00:56:34,498
..and cool mind.

1107
00:56:34,578 --> 00:56:36,833
You'll go very calmly and
talk to him very coolly..

1108
00:56:36,913 --> 00:56:39,925
..and try to convince him that
you can't marry her.

1109
00:56:40,325 --> 00:56:42,876
That's it. You're your mamma's
boy and you'll go back to her..

1110
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:44,629
.New York and all that..

1111
00:56:44,709 --> 00:56:46,499
And then we'll handle things here.

1112
00:56:46,579 --> 00:56:47,861
It's so simple, man.

1113
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:49,872
Why do I have to be
involved in your shit?

1114
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:52,196
You're from Harvard law School,
total professional presentation.

1115
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:53,440
Try to understand.

1116
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,328
I don't believe this.
This is unbelievable.

1117
00:56:55,408 --> 00:56:59,285
What the crap!
- Listen to the details first.

1118
00:56:59,365 --> 00:57:00,496
After that you can fight.

1119
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:07,704
Pashu!

1120
00:57:10,813 --> 00:57:12,013
Hey Pashu!

1121
00:57:12,575 --> 00:57:13,516
Come down.

1122
00:57:13,948 --> 00:57:14,813
Come down, scoundrel.

1123
00:57:15,992 --> 00:57:18,002
If you've the courage then
come down and talk to me.

1124
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,586
You backstabbed me.
Scoundrel!

1125
00:57:20,997 --> 00:57:23,721
Hey Pashu!

1126
00:57:23,981 --> 00:57:26,124
Come down.
- Chorda.. Chorda, calm down.

1127
00:57:26,204 --> 00:57:27,270
Shut up, scoundrel.

1128
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:30,211
How can we handle all this
if you also act irrational?

1129
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:33,573
Call him. call your brother.

1130
00:57:33,823 --> 00:57:36,115
Pashu, what do you want?

1131
00:57:36,493 --> 00:57:38,990
What do you want?
You want my money?

1132
00:57:39,271 --> 00:57:41,369
My wealth? My property?

1133
00:57:41,449 --> 00:57:42,720
What do you want? Tell me.
- Listen to me..

1134
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,417
You could've told me.

1135
00:57:44,701 --> 00:57:47,015
How dare you use your daughter?

1136
00:57:47,685 --> 00:57:49,372
He wants to keep Arjun with him
as stay-at-home son-in-law.

1137
00:57:49,664 --> 00:57:50,982
He wants to keep Arjun with him
after their marriage.

1138
00:57:51,062 --> 00:57:54,377
Listen to me, Chorda.
- Hey Pashu! Come down. Come down.

1139
00:57:54,457 --> 00:57:55,496
Lower your voice.

1140
00:57:57,161 --> 00:57:58,036
Speak softly.

1141
00:57:59,496 --> 00:58:02,728
Don't think that everybody
is as degraded as you.

1142
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:06,166
Degraded? I'm degraded?

1143
00:58:06,869 --> 00:58:08,512
Mind your language.

1144
00:58:08,782 --> 00:58:10,317
I'm drunk. Let me warn you.

1145
00:58:10,631 --> 00:58:11,647
What will you do?

1146
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:14,415
Beat me?

1147
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,132
What have you done, Pashu?
Tell me.

1148
00:58:25,695 --> 00:58:26,830
What have you done?

1149
00:58:28,265 --> 00:58:29,995
We were old friends..

1150
00:58:30,805 --> 00:58:34,168
But you've ruined our friendship.

1151
00:58:34,903 --> 00:58:36,395
You didn't trust me.

1152
00:58:36,475 --> 00:58:39,881
I always trusted you. Every time.

1153
00:58:40,746 --> 00:58:43,665
What did you want?
My business? My money?

1154
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:46,151
You could've told me once.

1155
00:58:46,692 --> 00:58:48,227
You could've told me.

1156
00:58:49,122 --> 00:58:50,786
I would give away everything
with a smile on my face.

1157
00:58:50,866 --> 00:58:53,468
Everything. I would give you
my property wealth, everything.

1158
00:58:53,548 --> 00:58:54,786
Will you all please stop?

1159
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:55,986
This has been going on for long.

1160
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:57,911
I don't understand what's happening.

1161
00:58:57,991 --> 00:58:59,588
The entire neighbourhood
can hear you fight.

1162
00:59:00,788 --> 00:59:03,739
Brother, come upstairs with me.
Come.

1163
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:05,653
We won't discuss anything now.
We'll discuss everything later.

1164
00:59:05,733 --> 00:59:08,856
None of you are in your senses now.
Come with me. Come.

1165
00:59:09,872 --> 00:59:10,780
No.
- Manmatha,

1166
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:11,904
please help him go upstairs.

1167
00:59:11,984 --> 00:59:13,212
Chorda, let's go upstairs.
- No.

1168
00:59:13,292 --> 00:59:15,775
Come.
- No.. no.. I won't go.

1169
00:59:15,855 --> 00:59:18,002
I won't go. I won't go.

1170
00:59:18,082 --> 00:59:19,101
Please come.

1171
00:59:21,512 --> 00:59:22,658
He's my brother.

1172
00:59:24,139 --> 00:59:25,764
Look what my brother has done.

1173
00:59:25,844 --> 00:59:29,829
Stop this drama.
Get out of here. Get out.

1174
00:59:29,909 --> 00:59:32,088
Answer me first.
- Chorda, please calm down.

1175
00:59:32,168 --> 00:59:34,300
What answers do you want?
What?

1176
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:37,554
Didn't I tell you to keep quiet?
- Shut up!

1177
00:59:37,634 --> 00:59:38,711
You're showing off your wealth?

1178
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,856
Brother, don't do this.

1179
00:59:42,936 --> 00:59:44,564
Here's your money.

1180
00:59:44,644 --> 00:59:46,197
Take it.
- What are you doing?

1181
00:59:46,415 --> 00:59:47,334
Borda, you..

1182
00:59:47,414 --> 00:59:48,955
Don't say anything.

1183
00:59:49,035 --> 00:59:53,049
I'll return every penny
you've given me till date.

1184
00:59:53,405 --> 00:59:54,519
Get out of here.

1185
00:59:55,113 --> 00:59:57,276
Get out from my house.
- Enough of all this.

1186
00:59:57,356 --> 00:59:59,370
Brother-in-law,
please come upstairs with me.

1187
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:00,861
Don't listen to him.
- Get out.

1188
01:00:00,941 --> 01:00:02,483
Don't get angry.
- Come upstairs.

1189
01:00:02,563 --> 01:00:03,499
Don't go away.

1190
01:00:03,579 --> 01:00:04,316
Brother-in-law..
- Please listen..

1191
01:00:04,396 --> 01:00:06,680
He's drunk since morning.
Don't mind his words.

1192
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,089
He's showing off his money?

1193
01:00:33,722 --> 01:00:37,452
The old stories in old Kolkata have
got stalled for the time being.

1194
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:41,603
The wedding preparations that
were going on has suddenly..

1195
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:44,623
..come to standstill.

1196
01:00:46,169 --> 01:00:47,466
Tell me something.

1197
01:00:48,614 --> 01:00:50,441
They may be good friends..

1198
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:52,620
..but can a Marwari guy

1199
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,922
be the son-in-law
of an aristocratic Bengali family?

1200
01:00:57,257 --> 01:01:00,387
Or can a Bengali bride
get married into an orthodox..

1201
01:01:00,873 --> 01:01:04,895
..Marwari family and
cook fish in that house?

1202
01:01:05,425 --> 01:01:06,884
What do you think?

1203
01:01:07,176 --> 01:01:08,214
Can they do it?

1204
01:01:08,294 --> 01:01:11,222
In the mean time Pravin Agarwal's
brother from America..

1205
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:15,990
..Navin, the one
who's standing up there.

1206
01:01:16,845 --> 01:01:19,839
Navin has come to take
a look at Ganesh Talkies.

1207
01:01:20,899 --> 01:01:22,185
There are few other people with him.

1208
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:25,061
The business associates of
promoter Mr. Sharma.

1209
01:01:25,828 --> 01:01:30,122
After overhearing their conversation
I've reached the conclusion that..

1210
01:01:31,236 --> 01:01:33,480
..they're going to replace..

1211
01:01:33,560 --> 01:01:35,592
..Ganesh Talkies with a
newly constructed multiplex.

1212
01:01:38,057 --> 01:01:40,479
If that happens..
well, it's my personal opinion..

1213
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:42,557
..it'll actually be good
if it happens.

1214
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:44,189
Do you know why?

1215
01:01:44,687 --> 01:01:47,833
That's because there are hardly
any footfalls in this movie theatre?

1216
01:01:48,612 --> 01:01:52,168
If they build a multiplex here, they'll
screen different kinds of movies..

1217
01:01:52,471 --> 01:01:57,757
..for example 'Autograph'
or 'Bhooter Bhabisyat' or..

1218
01:01:58,071 --> 01:01:59,818
..'Antaheen'.

1219
01:02:01,591 --> 01:02:02,532
..'Antaheen'.

1220
01:02:02,737 --> 01:02:06,121
The people of this neighbourhood will
get to enjoy these good movies..

1221
01:02:06,543 --> 01:02:07,375
..and so will I.

1222
01:02:07,455 --> 01:02:10,247
Mr. Naskar,
don't worry about anything.

1223
01:02:10,582 --> 01:02:12,794
You won't face any problem..

1224
01:02:12,874 --> 01:02:13,950
..if a multiplex is built here
or the name is changed.

1225
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:15,604
You'll have a job. Okay?

1226
01:02:15,684 --> 01:02:18,469
Sir, please take care of me.
- They'll come. Help them.

1227
01:02:18,549 --> 01:02:19,800
Okay. Bye.

1228
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:20,604
Stay well.

1229
01:02:22,431 --> 01:02:26,161
Arjun! Arjun! Where are you?

1230
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:29,374
Is this what you planned to do?
Did you plan to do this?

1231
01:02:29,925 --> 01:02:31,017
Do you want to live with them?

1232
01:02:31,288 --> 01:02:33,104
Do you want to stay with them
after marriage?

1233
01:02:33,601 --> 01:02:34,479
Will you eat fish?

1234
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:37,096
Uncle..
- Shut up! Move.

1235
01:02:37,176 --> 01:02:37,798
Stay away from him.

1236
01:02:37,878 --> 01:02:39,247
Anglo-Indian!

1237
01:02:39,327 --> 01:02:41,463
Can't you hear? Can't you?

1238
01:02:41,543 --> 01:02:43,593
Are you deaf? Are you deaf?

1239
01:02:43,816 --> 01:02:45,286
I stay in this house
because I like it.

1240
01:02:45,366 --> 01:02:50,670
The day I feel that I don't like
staying here, I'll leave right away.

1241
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:51,905
Then get out.

1242
01:02:51,985 --> 01:02:53,505
I won't wait for your orders.

1243
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:55,256
So, you won't wait.
- Yes.

1244
01:02:55,336 --> 01:02:58,337
I don't stay here because
you've given me shelter here.

1245
01:02:58,417 --> 01:03:01,522
I don't stay here for the peanuts
that I get as pocket money..

1246
01:03:01,602 --> 01:03:02,885
..or the simple food that I get here.

1247
01:03:02,965 --> 01:03:05,133
I won't wait for anyone
if I decide to leave.

1248
01:03:06,363 --> 01:03:08,254
You've gone crazy after taking drugs.

1249
01:03:08,334 --> 01:03:11,251
Have I lost my mind
or have you lost it?

1250
01:03:11,478 --> 01:03:13,629
It's my helplessness that
I stay here.

1251
01:03:13,709 --> 01:03:15,770
Come on, Arjun.
- And your friend Pashu..

1252
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:16,656
Stop it.
- Friend..

1253
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:18,112
Your friend Pashu..
- C'mon, Arjun..

1254
01:03:18,192 --> 01:03:22,328
I've been seeing you Bragging
about Pashu all the time.

1255
01:03:22,408 --> 01:03:24,360
Pashu, my friend..
let's have a drink.

1256
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:28,064
Saban who was your daughter
till last night..

1257
01:03:28,144 --> 01:03:29,481
..have been completely
forgotten by you.

1258
01:03:29,561 --> 01:03:30,821
Let it be.

1259
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:35,100
Your friend has locked up
his daughter in his house.

1260
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,610
She didn't eat anything
since last night.

1261
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:38,311
She didn't eat anything
since last night.

1262
01:03:38,391 --> 01:03:40,225
To hell with Pashu.

1263
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:41,771
I won't enter the house.

1264
01:03:41,851 --> 01:03:44,560
If you enter that house
then I won't treat you as my son.

1265
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:45,338
Got it?

1266
01:03:45,418 --> 01:03:48,724
I don't care if you don't treat me
as your son.

1267
01:03:48,907 --> 01:03:50,053
Get out of here.

1268
01:03:50,133 --> 01:03:51,750
You think he'll help.
- Stop it, my friend.

1269
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:53,372
Leave me.
- Yes, leave him.

1270
01:03:53,452 --> 01:03:56,071
Leave me.
- He's drugged all the time.

1271
01:03:56,151 --> 01:03:57,109
I'm leaving.
- Hey!

1272
01:03:57,189 --> 01:03:59,267
Will you stop loitering around?
I won't come back.

1273
01:03:59,948 --> 01:04:02,716
Saban.. hey Saban..

1274
01:04:03,721 --> 01:04:06,575
Please open the door.
Please open it.

1275
01:04:06,964 --> 01:04:08,294
Listen to me.

1276
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:10,207
Just look at her.

1277
01:04:10,597 --> 01:04:13,505
You haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.

1278
01:04:14,153 --> 01:04:15,559
Eat something.

1279
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:17,397
Please listen to me, Saban.

1280
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:21,813
He's your father.

1281
01:04:22,267 --> 01:04:24,591
He may have said some unpleasant
words in a fit of rage.

1282
01:04:24,926 --> 01:04:25,834
It's normal for
father's to reprimand.

1283
01:04:25,914 --> 01:04:27,283
Why do you've to pay heed
to his words?

1284
01:04:28,315 --> 01:04:29,504
Please open the door.

1285
01:04:31,093 --> 01:04:33,699
What shall I do now, sister-in-law?
I'll go mad.

1286
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:37,299
Saban.. Saban, open the door.

1287
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,396
Shibu, please do something.

1288
01:04:47,057 --> 01:04:48,105
Brother..

1289
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,141
Brother..

1290
01:04:53,481 --> 01:04:54,454
Yes, tell me.

1291
01:04:54,534 --> 01:04:56,865
I know what's hurting you.

1292
01:04:57,183 --> 01:04:59,929
But, starving is not going to
help improve matters.

1293
01:05:00,783 --> 01:05:02,243
The wedding is scheduled
after three days.

1294
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:05,259
People will laugh at us.

1295
01:05:07,542 --> 01:05:10,742
Ghosh family may not have wealth
but we've a reputation and prestige.

1296
01:05:16,592 --> 01:05:19,350
Will Saban ever get
a nice groom like Nicky?

1297
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:26,110
I visited Mr. Ashok in the morning
and apologized to him earnestly.

1298
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:31,397
I can't let the wedding be called off.

1299
01:05:33,944 --> 01:05:35,335
This wedding will
definitely take place.

1300
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:42,759
Just imagine how
ill-mannered Arjun is.

1301
01:05:46,293 --> 01:05:48,215
As long as I'm alive I won't
get my daughter married to Arjun.

1302
01:05:48,295 --> 01:05:50,328
I may get her married
to anybody else but not him.

1303
01:05:50,932 --> 01:05:57,367
I think they didn't have
the courage to tell you or why..

1304
01:05:57,513 --> 01:05:58,754
He's a Marwari guy.

1305
01:05:59,929 --> 01:06:02,365
I'll never get my daughter
married to a Marwari guy.

1306
01:06:02,521 --> 01:06:04,939
But, brother.. I..

1307
01:06:08,270 --> 01:06:09,159
Uncle..

1308
01:06:14,135 --> 01:06:15,192
Get out.

1309
01:06:15,414 --> 01:06:16,766
Uncle, I'm going away.

1310
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:24,974
I never wanted..
I never wanted to harm you.

1311
01:06:25,683 --> 01:06:28,676
If anything has..
- I told you to get out of the house.

1312
01:06:30,524 --> 01:06:35,435
I just wanted to say
that Saban is not guilty.

1313
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,063
She's not guilty.

1314
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:40,626
I'm telling you to get
out but you won't listen.

1315
01:06:59,975 --> 01:07:01,250
Bye, auntie.

1316
01:07:03,474 --> 01:07:05,913
You told me that we'll go to Naihati..

1317
01:07:05,993 --> 01:07:08,097
..where you'll work in
your uncle's video parlour.

1318
01:07:08,964 --> 01:07:11,016
The situation is not good.

1319
01:07:11,905 --> 01:07:13,571
Let's forget all these for few days.

1320
01:07:13,802 --> 01:07:14,741
We won't go to Naihati.

1321
01:07:14,986 --> 01:07:15,980
We'll go straight to Patna.

1322
01:07:16,315 --> 01:07:17,761
Listen..

1323
01:07:18,712 --> 01:07:22,044
My maternal uncle has
a hotel in Patna. Yes.

1324
01:07:22,345 --> 01:07:23,607
I've spoken to him.

1325
01:07:23,813 --> 01:07:24,771
I'll surely get a job there.

1326
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,199
Let me arrange some money.

1327
01:07:28,347 --> 01:07:30,320
Get ready.

1328
01:07:31,124 --> 01:07:33,785
As soon as I get some money,
we'll run away from here.

1329
01:07:34,068 --> 01:07:35,687
You always keep changing your plans.

1330
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:36,615
You're a liar.

1331
01:07:36,695 --> 01:07:39,836
Listen to me carefully.

1332
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:45,921
I may do anything
but I'll never leave you.

1333
01:07:48,592 --> 01:07:54,206
If I've loved anyone truly, it's you.

1334
01:07:59,131 --> 01:08:02,385
I can't work as a maid anymore, Shibu.

1335
01:08:02,705 --> 01:08:04,593
I can't do it anymore.

1336
01:08:05,943 --> 01:08:07,260
Do something.

1337
01:08:08,503 --> 01:08:09,407
I'm trying.

1338
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,924
I promised you.. as soon as
I get some money, we'll run away.

1339
01:08:16,330 --> 01:08:18,805
Try to understand my situation.

1340
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:19,742
Manda!

1341
01:08:19,822 --> 01:08:20,709
Coming.

1342
01:08:40,128 --> 01:08:42,655
I've three offices in Kolkata.

1343
01:08:43,326 --> 01:08:45,848
But, I like this place.

1344
01:08:48,188 --> 01:08:52,842
I hope you're not feeling
uncomfortable here. - No.

1345
01:08:53,313 --> 01:08:55,034
Actual work doesn't
happen within office walls.

1346
01:08:56,183 --> 01:09:00,957
When I construct a house
or building it's like a baby for me.

1347
01:09:02,185 --> 01:09:05,194
I love spending my time
at the construction site.

1348
01:09:06,836 --> 01:09:10,656
After three months this
building will no longer be mine.

1349
01:09:11,131 --> 01:09:13,481
The building will be completed.
My baby will grow-up.

1350
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,616
Other families will settle down here.

1351
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:17,110
The house will be theirs.

1352
01:09:17,985 --> 01:09:21,552
I'll go in search
of a new baby after that.

1353
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:24,107
Ganesh, give him the documents.

1354
01:09:28,032 --> 01:09:29,177
Order two cups of strong tea.

1355
01:09:29,257 --> 01:09:30,977
Or would you prefer black coffee?

1356
01:09:31,110 --> 01:09:32,200
Barista is located close by.

1357
01:09:33,066 --> 01:09:33,644
No.

1358
01:09:35,250 --> 01:09:39,203
But brother, you'll need
time to read the document in detail.

1359
01:09:39,862 --> 01:09:41,920
I don't have much time.
- Same here.

1360
01:09:42,938 --> 01:09:46,600
But brother, whatever I do is legal.

1361
01:09:47,242 --> 01:09:48,277
Read it.

1362
01:09:49,163 --> 01:09:50,378
When do I have to vacate the house?

1363
01:09:50,746 --> 01:09:51,642
Today itself if you wish to.

1364
01:09:51,997 --> 01:09:54,551
Everything in Rajarhat
is ready to move in.

1365
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,216
You can shift any time.
Fully-furnished.

1366
01:09:58,505 --> 01:10:00,414
I'll shift after
my daughter's wedding.

1367
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:03,101
It'll take a month's time.

1368
01:10:04,134 --> 01:10:05,906
My wife and brother will
go to Rajarhat in the mean time..

1369
01:10:05,986 --> 01:10:08,057
..to take a look
at the flat at Rajarhat.

1370
01:10:08,845 --> 01:10:13,055
Mr. Ghosh,
I may do anything but I never betray.

1371
01:10:14,277 --> 01:10:15,835
I promise you the best.

1372
01:10:16,113 --> 01:10:19,847
You can't imagine how huge
the penthouse in Rajarhat is.

1373
01:10:20,981 --> 01:10:22,591
Four bedrooms, three bathrooms,

1374
01:10:22,671 --> 01:10:25,169
One big kitchen space, dining space,

1375
01:10:25,619 --> 01:10:27,140
A huge drawing room.

1376
01:10:27,572 --> 01:10:29,551
And a separate chamber for you.

1377
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:31,900
A prayer room for sister-in-law.

1378
01:10:32,172 --> 01:10:34,387
And you also have the entire terrace.

1379
01:10:34,975 --> 01:10:38,221
There's a garden on the terrace.

1380
01:10:38,877 --> 01:10:41,608
Where do I have to sign?
- Sign all the papers.

1381
01:10:43,350 --> 01:10:45,215
Ganesh, give sir the bag.

1382
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:53,042
Arjun, I suggest that you leave Saban.

1383
01:10:54,589 --> 01:10:56,408
Nicky will keep Saban happy.

1384
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,349
She'll be better with him.

1385
01:10:58,429 --> 01:10:59,405
Oh no!

1386
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:03,829
But, Saban must understand this.

1387
01:11:05,398 --> 01:11:07,057
I'll take care of it.

1388
01:11:08,009 --> 01:11:13,194
I'll meet Saban and
I'll try to convince her.

1389
01:11:14,706 --> 01:11:18,199
Problems will increase
if you are adamant.

1390
01:11:20,206 --> 01:11:21,992
What's the use of
increasing your problems?

1391
01:11:22,115 --> 01:11:24,413
Will you be able
to go away with Saban?

1392
01:11:25,534 --> 01:11:26,441
You won't be able to do it.

1393
01:11:27,663 --> 01:11:29,505
You're not that sort.

1394
01:11:31,697 --> 01:11:33,143
So, no use thinking of doing it.

1395
01:11:34,536 --> 01:11:38,709
It'll be better if
Saban shifts to America.

1396
01:11:39,697 --> 01:11:42,195
She'll be happy there.

1397
01:11:43,021 --> 01:11:45,878
It means she'll get married?
- Of course.

1398
01:11:46,321 --> 01:11:47,967
It'll go as planned.

1399
01:11:49,148 --> 01:11:49,941
What after that?

1400
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:51,088
What else?

1401
01:11:51,168 --> 01:11:53,412
Arjun will take care of the
arrangements the way he was doing.

1402
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:54,463
What next?

1403
01:11:55,488 --> 01:11:56,519
What else?

1404
01:11:56,672 --> 01:11:59,974
Arjun will go there
on the wedding night.

1405
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,045
To attend the wedding?
- Yes.

1406
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,942
What will he wear for the wedding?
- What?

1407
01:12:09,206 --> 01:12:14,871
A red shirt paired with a white coat.

1408
01:12:15,253 --> 01:12:17,684
Oh no!

1409
01:12:18,283 --> 01:12:19,689
White coat. Okay. What next?

1410
01:12:20,326 --> 01:12:22,254
What else? He'll sing songs.

1411
01:12:23,016 --> 01:12:24,130
Which song?

1412
01:12:24,697 --> 01:12:25,705
That song.

1413
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:27,526
Which song?

1414
01:12:28,374 --> 01:12:30,573
That song..
-Which song?

1415
01:12:30,818 --> 01:12:32,138
Tell me which song
you're talking about.

1416
01:12:34,795 --> 01:12:35,785
What happened?

1417
01:12:36,223 --> 01:12:37,225
Which song?

1418
01:12:37,467 --> 01:12:41,930
"I'm a stranger here."

1419
01:12:42,101 --> 01:12:45,935
"I'm a stranger here."

1420
01:12:46,339 --> 01:12:50,823
"I'm myself."

1421
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,705
"I'm a stranger here."

1422
01:12:56,145 --> 01:12:57,165
What next?

1423
01:12:57,484 --> 01:12:59,318
Everybody will listen to his song.

1424
01:13:00,785 --> 01:13:02,442
Everybody swill shed tears.

1425
01:13:03,054 --> 01:13:03,999
Who's the hero?

1426
01:13:04,236 --> 01:13:05,215
Who is the real hero?

1427
01:13:05,295 --> 01:13:07,399
Who?
- It's Arjun.

1428
01:13:07,578 --> 01:13:09,219
Saban must understand this.

1429
01:13:09,423 --> 01:13:12,152
Okay, I'll go to Saban's place.
- Okay.

1430
01:13:12,354 --> 01:13:13,019
But, how will you go there?

1431
01:13:13,099 --> 01:13:15,907
I wish I could convince
the priest somehow.

1432
01:13:16,508 --> 01:13:18,538
She's not taking any
calls and you're planning to..

1433
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:19,882
I know..

1434
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:23,772
I know she's not taking calls. She..

1435
01:13:24,057 --> 01:13:28,697
I'll say that I'm Sapna's
cousin and enter her house.

1436
01:13:28,777 --> 01:13:29,615
Are you crazy?

1437
01:13:29,788 --> 01:13:32,133
They've seen you all roaming together.

1438
01:13:32,213 --> 01:13:33,767
You'll be thrashed
badly if you're caught.

1439
01:13:34,185 --> 01:13:36,188
I'll give some excuse
and enter her house.

1440
01:13:36,449 --> 01:13:36,916
What excuse will you give?

1441
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:38,450
I'll enter the house.
- What excuse will you give?

1442
01:13:38,567 --> 01:13:41,653
Arjun, listen to me.

1443
01:13:42,114 --> 01:13:44,463
She'll be happy with Nicky.

1444
01:13:45,261 --> 01:13:47,054
I assure you that she'll be happy.
Listen to me.

1445
01:13:47,721 --> 01:13:52,436
Look, this is not possible.
It's impossible.

1446
01:13:53,184 --> 01:13:54,989
What can you do?

1447
01:13:55,554 --> 01:13:56,764
You'll elope with her.

1448
01:13:57,036 --> 01:13:57,758
But where?

1449
01:13:58,665 --> 01:14:00,783
How long? How?

1450
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:04,457
It'll be better if you
let the wedding take place.

1451
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:08,735
It'll be good for both you and her.

1452
01:14:10,572 --> 01:14:19,253
If you really love Saban
you'll wish her well-being. Right?

1453
01:14:20,869 --> 01:14:24,965
Let her go to America. Got it?

1454
01:14:25,193 --> 01:14:26,119
Do something.

1455
01:14:26,268 --> 01:14:28,139
Let her get married
and end the problems.

1456
01:14:28,371 --> 01:14:30,285
We've had enough.

1457
01:14:30,626 --> 01:14:32,908
Got it?
- Right.

1458
01:14:34,632 --> 01:14:35,806
Absolutely right.

1459
01:14:38,667 --> 01:14:39,451
Bravo!

1460
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:41,333
You're absolutely right.

1461
01:14:42,523 --> 01:14:44,211
You've having great fun. Isn't it?

1462
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,118
Great fun.

1463
01:14:51,149 --> 01:14:53,154
You're playing carom, singing songs.

1464
01:14:53,684 --> 01:14:55,429
You're planning what
you'll wear for the wedding.

1465
01:14:56,744 --> 01:14:58,458
You're enjoying a lot.

1466
01:14:59,335 --> 01:15:03,294
I'm in great trouble and
you're in the mood of joking.

1467
01:15:04,248 --> 01:15:05,116
That's good.

1468
01:15:06,457 --> 01:15:07,378
Forget it.

1469
01:15:07,701 --> 01:15:09,139
I'll leave now.

1470
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:10,636
Let's go. Stop playing. Let's go.

1471
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:11,200
What?

1472
01:15:11,427 --> 01:15:14,449
Hey listen to me. Listen.

1473
01:15:15,825 --> 01:15:16,662
What?

1474
01:15:21,758 --> 01:15:25,980
I've written a letter.
Give it to Saban.

1475
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:29,643
Okay, I'll give it.

1476
01:15:29,723 --> 01:15:30,817
Decide what you want
to disguise yourself as..

1477
01:15:30,897 --> 01:15:34,639
Uncle, aunt, anything.
Give any excuse and do it. Okay?

1478
01:15:36,088 --> 01:15:37,787
Please don't sing songs there.

1479
01:15:38,779 --> 01:15:39,922
Don't even try.

1480
01:15:42,258 --> 01:15:43,031
What's this?

1481
01:15:43,111 --> 01:15:44,659
It's done. Go and do your job.

1482
01:15:44,739 --> 01:15:45,624
Go.

1483
01:15:45,704 --> 01:15:46,899
He wants to send her to America.

1484
01:15:49,515 --> 01:15:50,205
Khagen!

1485
01:15:52,287 --> 01:15:53,181
Hey Khagen!

1486
01:15:55,745 --> 01:15:56,854
Khagen!
Tie the rope.

1487
01:15:57,682 --> 01:15:58,208
Hey Khagen!

1488
01:15:58,302 --> 01:16:00,028
What happened?

1489
01:16:00,945 --> 01:16:02,420
The wedding will take
place day after tomorrow.

1490
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,954
Is everything ready
from your side? - Yes.

1491
01:16:04,205 --> 01:16:06,401
Sir is calling you.
- What?

1492
01:16:06,481 --> 01:16:06,962
Sir is calling..

1493
01:16:07,042 --> 01:16:09,563
Hey! If you don't
finish the pandal today,

1494
01:16:09,685 --> 01:16:10,861
I'll throw you out of here.

1495
01:16:10,974 --> 01:16:11,194
Sir..

1496
01:16:11,274 --> 01:16:13,484
The wedding will take
place as per schedule.

1497
01:16:13,722 --> 01:16:15,638
Go and inform Boro Ma.
- Okay.

1498
01:16:16,675 --> 01:16:19,660
You've always shied
away from responsibilities.

1499
01:16:19,919 --> 01:16:21,380
It's time to take
up some responsibilities.

1500
01:16:21,598 --> 01:16:22,905
Shibu will carry the gifts.

1501
01:16:22,985 --> 01:16:24,529
The rest is your responsibility.

1502
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:25,934
Inform the relatives that
the wedding is scheduled..

1503
01:16:26,014 --> 01:16:27,059
..at 7 in the evening.

1504
01:16:27,216 --> 01:16:28,987
Everything should
be carried out properly.

1505
01:16:29,372 --> 01:16:32,793
Brother.. I was saying..
- What?

1506
01:16:34,443 --> 01:16:38,130
Won't you speak to Saban?

1507
01:16:38,266 --> 01:16:39,397
Do your work.

1508
01:16:39,547 --> 01:16:40,249
No. Arjun is..

1509
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:42,677
I'll never let my daughter
get married to a Marwari guy..

1510
01:16:42,757 --> 01:16:44,065
..as long as I'm alive.

1511
01:16:44,349 --> 01:16:46,710
The same guy was taking care
of everything till date, brother.

1512
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:49,218
Doing odd jobs and
marriage is not the same.

1513
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:50,597
Idiot!

1514
01:16:51,019 --> 01:16:55,057
The only thing I can't do is
ruin the reputation of Ghosh family.

1515
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,462
The relatives have
received the wedding card.

1516
01:16:56,542 --> 01:16:57,494
What will they see
when they come here?

1517
01:16:57,698 --> 01:16:58,600
That the groom has changed.

1518
01:16:58,868 --> 01:16:59,670
What does the groom do?

1519
01:16:59,809 --> 01:17:00,936
He runs a cinema hall.

1520
01:17:01,489 --> 01:17:04,066
The son-in-law of Ghosh
family is owner of a cinema hall.

1521
01:17:04,635 --> 01:17:06,205
My plight is not so miserable yet.

1522
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,056
Saban is angry right now.

1523
01:17:09,159 --> 01:17:10,548
She'll also understand
everything once she cools down.

1524
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,400
A Marwari is after all a Marwari.

1525
01:17:12,991 --> 01:17:15,129
He was your childhood friend.

1526
01:17:15,872 --> 01:17:17,363
He was bearing all
the wedding expenses.

1527
01:17:17,443 --> 01:17:18,541
He won't bear the expenses anymore.

1528
01:17:20,485 --> 01:17:23,956
The wedding expenses
will be borne by me.

1529
01:17:25,091 --> 01:17:28,856
But, how will you arrange
such a lot of money?

1530
01:17:29,915 --> 01:17:32,034
You wanted to shift
to Rajarhat. Right?

1531
01:17:35,825 --> 01:17:38,161
I've sold the house.
- What?

1532
01:17:38,688 --> 01:17:40,760
Gouri, get the wedding gifts ready.

1533
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:43,048
Shibu will take the gifts tomorrow.

1534
01:18:04,869 --> 01:18:06,726
This is the fun of
living in this city.

1535
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:10,842
It's believed that there
are few cities which have..

1536
01:18:10,922 --> 01:18:12,883
..such communal diversity.

1537
01:18:14,341 --> 01:18:16,001
But whenever the question
of inter-community marriage..

1538
01:18:16,367 --> 01:18:19,338
..comes up the diversity
becomes prominent.

1539
01:18:20,325 --> 01:18:21,954
You might say..

1540
01:18:24,431 --> 01:18:26,081
Hey brother!

1541
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:28,637
What's the matter?

1542
01:18:29,082 --> 01:18:32,242
Get lost. Get out.

1543
01:18:33,121 --> 01:18:35,479
Hey! Don't smoke.

1544
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:36,786
A warning will come up at the bottom.

1545
01:18:36,896 --> 01:18:38,558
Go out, my son. Go out.

1546
01:18:40,563 --> 01:18:42,050
Yes! I was saying that..

1547
01:18:42,496 --> 01:18:49,246
..you might say that aren't Muslims
getting married to Hindus in Kolkata?

1548
01:18:49,419 --> 01:18:53,597
Or don't Christians marry Muslims?

1549
01:18:55,329 --> 01:18:56,473
Of course they do.

1550
01:18:56,926 --> 01:18:58,831
They definitely do.

1551
01:18:59,472 --> 01:19:02,699
But tell me truly how
many of us would agree..

1552
01:19:02,779 --> 01:19:07,765
..to get a Bengali girl
married to a Marwari guy.

1553
01:19:09,733 --> 01:19:12,158
What? Think of it.

1554
01:19:14,903 --> 01:19:16,946
What are you up to?

1555
01:19:17,087 --> 01:19:18,212
Didn't I tell you to go out?

1556
01:19:19,081 --> 01:19:23,105
Actually, the matter is..
I'm Sapna's brother. - Oh!

1557
01:19:23,963 --> 01:19:26,226
In that case,
I'm Rudraprasad Sengupta.

1558
01:19:26,577 --> 01:19:27,728
That's not true.
- What?

1559
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:29,979
I'm actually Sapna's brother.
- Oh!

1560
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:33,496
There's a letter from Sapna.
- Okay.

1561
01:19:33,652 --> 01:19:34,915
It's very important.
- Okay.

1562
01:19:35,215 --> 01:19:36,588
I've to deliver it.

1563
01:19:36,759 --> 01:19:37,622
I can do it.

1564
01:19:38,386 --> 01:19:41,194
No, don't do anything
but take me to Saban.

1565
01:19:41,367 --> 01:19:43,174
Oh! Do you want me to
carry you in my arms, brother?

1566
01:19:43,382 --> 01:19:45,389
Don't you have legs?

1567
01:19:46,872 --> 01:19:48,564
Isn't it? - No.
- Then what?

1568
01:19:49,002 --> 01:19:51,243
Actually, I don't know anyone here.

1569
01:19:51,323 --> 01:19:53,421
If I enter suddenly people
might misunderstand me.

1570
01:19:53,501 --> 01:19:55,655
Don't you get me?
- Yes.

1571
01:19:58,405 --> 01:19:59,481
In that case..

1572
01:20:01,118 --> 01:20:02,667
Let's go.
- Okay.

1573
01:20:03,250 --> 01:20:04,841
Open the glares when
you go inside. - Okay.

1574
01:20:04,921 --> 01:20:05,768
Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

1575
01:20:16,858 --> 01:20:17,961
Boro Ma.

1576
01:20:21,460 --> 01:20:22,669
Boro Ma.

1577
01:20:24,634 --> 01:20:25,604
What?

1578
01:20:25,813 --> 01:20:29,858
Guy from Sapna's house has come here.

1579
01:20:30,317 --> 01:20:32,158
Saban's friend Sapna.

1580
01:20:33,767 --> 01:20:36,079
He wants to meet her.
He has some work with her.

1581
01:20:37,386 --> 01:20:38,750
Go and tell Saban.

1582
01:20:40,471 --> 01:20:41,517
Open the glares.

1583
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:42,879
Okay.

1584
01:20:44,237 --> 01:20:45,024
Come.

1585
01:20:46,601 --> 01:20:47,399
Come with me.

1586
01:20:58,254 --> 01:20:59,163
Madam..

1587
01:21:03,241 --> 01:21:06,479
Madam, Sapna's brother
has come with a letter for you.

1588
01:21:09,061 --> 01:21:09,961
Madam..

1589
01:21:13,341 --> 01:21:14,179
Go.

1590
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,620
Listen, Sapna has
sent a letter for you.

1591
01:21:30,526 --> 01:21:33,391
Shall I say something?
- Yes.

1592
01:21:34,629 --> 01:21:38,314
Arjun will never lie to you.

1593
01:21:39,275 --> 01:21:42,821
He'll never wish ill for you.

1594
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:46,380
I want to meet him.

1595
01:21:48,034 --> 01:21:49,192
Will you take me?

1596
01:21:50,047 --> 01:21:51,191
Can you come with me?

1597
01:21:52,123 --> 01:21:53,072
Then let's go right now.

1598
01:21:55,677 --> 01:21:57,519
Mother, I'm going to Sapna's house.

1599
01:21:57,599 --> 01:21:59,052
I'll be back in an hour.

1600
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:03,124
Wait, I'll change and come.
- Okay.

1601
01:22:03,672 --> 01:22:04,544
What happened?

1602
01:22:22,627 --> 01:22:27,855
Khagen, does anybody
named Sapna really exist?

1603
01:22:28,622 --> 01:22:30,744
It's a big neighbourhood.

1604
01:22:30,824 --> 01:22:34,592
Why won't there be a girl named Sapna?

1605
01:22:35,130 --> 01:22:40,777
What's your name?
- Antony, the Anglo-Indian. - Yes.

1606
01:22:41,619 --> 01:22:44,791
I'm allowing her to go only for you.

1607
01:22:45,318 --> 01:22:47,435
Please drop her home safely.

1608
01:22:47,851 --> 01:22:49,667
You know what's going on everywhere.

1609
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,503
No auntie, don't worry.

1610
01:22:51,583 --> 01:22:53,677
I'll drop her home.

1611
01:22:54,281 --> 01:22:57,169
Bnoro Ma.
- Boro ma, I'll drop her home.

1612
01:22:57,249 --> 01:22:58,756
Don't worry.
I'll bring her back.

1613
01:22:59,526 --> 01:23:00,090
Let's go.

1614
01:23:01,247 --> 01:23:03,237
I've explained a little to brother.

1615
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,765
I've met with the builder.

1616
01:23:04,893 --> 01:23:07,426
I've talked to the guys
of the picture theatre.. - Yeah.

1617
01:23:07,506 --> 01:23:08,046
To the..

1618
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:12,709
Why did you take Sharma's
men to the cinema hall?

1619
01:23:12,789 --> 01:23:14,032
Well..
- Why?

1620
01:23:14,608 --> 01:23:18,488
Brother,
whatever I'm doing has a purpose.

1621
01:23:18,771 --> 01:23:20,041
You should understand.

1622
01:23:20,121 --> 01:23:20,775
What shall I understand?

1623
01:23:20,892 --> 01:23:21,844
What should I understand?

1624
01:23:23,861 --> 01:23:25,153
Are you going to make
a business deal with..

1625
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:26,078
..a degraded man like Sharma?

1626
01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:28,125
Why are you losing your temper,
brother?

1627
01:23:28,394 --> 01:23:31,708
I also have rights on Ganesh Talkies.

1628
01:23:32,054 --> 01:23:34,404
I too have the right
to think something about it.

1629
01:23:34,803 --> 01:23:36,320
And as far as I'm concerned, brother..

1630
01:23:36,612 --> 01:23:41,814
..this is a complete waste of time,
money, space, everything.

1631
01:23:42,151 --> 01:23:44,397
And as a seasoned distributor,
brother..

1632
01:23:44,857 --> 01:23:49,132
..You've to understand that
single screens don't work these days.

1633
01:23:49,603 --> 01:23:51,353
We've to do something about it..

1634
01:23:51,433 --> 01:23:54,060
..at the very least
we've to modernize it.

1635
01:23:54,415 --> 01:23:57,216
For that we've to sort
of make it a multiplex.

1636
01:23:57,296 --> 01:23:58,866
We've to sort of have a food court.
Shopping mall.

1637
01:23:59,017 --> 01:24:01,406
To hell with the multiplex
and shopping mall.

1638
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:02,327
Brother..

1639
01:24:02,407 --> 01:24:03,607
You won't be able to handle anything.

1640
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,020
You came from America. Right?
Go back to America.

1641
01:24:06,139 --> 01:24:07,454
Go and do your job there.

1642
01:24:08,370 --> 01:24:10,079
Brother, let me explain.

1643
01:24:12,624 --> 01:24:15,723
He has lost his job in America.

1644
01:24:21,648 --> 01:24:24,807
And.. we won't go back now.

1645
01:24:31,815 --> 01:24:33,269
He lost his job.

1646
01:24:39,748 --> 01:24:40,963
I want to say..

1647
01:24:41,162 --> 01:24:42,601
We were not here
of so many years and..

1648
01:24:42,681 --> 01:24:44,216
..you handled the business.

1649
01:24:44,525 --> 01:24:46,279
We're very grateful for that.

1650
01:24:46,814 --> 01:24:48,516
But, we've come back now.

1651
01:24:48,940 --> 01:24:50,505
Give us our share in the property.

1652
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:55,590
It's a simple calculation.

1653
01:24:56,371 --> 01:24:58,385
You can handle the
business of crackers.

1654
01:24:59,863 --> 01:25:01,534
Give the cinema hall to him.

1655
01:25:06,615 --> 01:25:09,148
Navin, take out the
power of attorney documents.

1656
01:25:11,084 --> 01:25:14,073
Brother, we've made a power
of attorney. Go through it.

1657
01:25:14,750 --> 01:25:18,528
If you think it's okay
then give us the cinema hall.

1658
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,763
She is right.

1659
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:36,385
After all they also
have right on this property.

1660
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:45,771
Where is the document?

1661
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,227
Give it.

1662
01:25:48,269 --> 01:25:49,763
Your brother will sign it.

1663
01:25:51,173 --> 01:25:54,358
He'll give you the cinema hall.

1664
01:25:56,622 --> 01:25:57,873
Isn't it?

1665
01:26:00,712 --> 01:26:02,018
Won't you give it to them?

1666
01:26:09,144 --> 01:26:09,985
Don't cry.

1667
01:26:15,091 --> 01:26:17,492
Give them what they want.

1668
01:26:17,974 --> 01:26:19,888
Enough.

1669
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,328
Listen to me.
- See, I'm trying to tell you.

1670
01:26:25,492 --> 01:26:28,271
I said, listen to me.
-See, I was just trying to say..

1671
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:29,488
Listen to me.

1672
01:26:30,634 --> 01:26:32,904
You said what you had to
say in that bloody letter of yours.

1673
01:26:33,024 --> 01:26:34,220
Now you listen to me.

1674
01:26:35,237 --> 01:26:37,179
You just tried to run away.

1675
01:26:37,844 --> 01:26:40,048
I want to tell you
I'm going to marry Nicky.

1676
01:26:40,321 --> 01:26:41,120
And you know why?

1677
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,919
Not because of family
pressure or anything.

1678
01:26:43,029 --> 01:26:44,639
Because you're a coward.

1679
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:48,699
How could you say that
I'll be happy in America?

1680
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:50,539
How could you write that letter?

1681
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:51,836
You just thought about yourself.

1682
01:26:51,916 --> 01:26:54,262
No, I just want to clear
it out you know. that's it.

1683
01:26:54,655 --> 01:26:56,908
Oh! Let's elope.

1684
01:26:56,988 --> 01:26:58,524
Come on. Let's run away. I'm ready.

1685
01:26:58,604 --> 01:26:59,603
Saban, I want to tell you that..

1686
01:26:59,683 --> 01:27:02,728
You stay out of it.
- Okay. Okay.

1687
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:11,250
Anyway, don't' worry.

1688
01:27:12,225 --> 01:27:14,636
I wasn't serious about
running away with you.

1689
01:27:14,906 --> 01:27:15,895
Because you know why?

1690
01:27:16,171 --> 01:27:18,946
You don't have the
guts or the ability.

1691
01:27:19,473 --> 01:27:22,501
I just came to tell
you that I'm marrying Nicky.

1692
01:27:22,581 --> 01:27:23,720
Not because I love him...

1693
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:25,445
..because we'll love each other.

1694
01:27:25,598 --> 01:27:27,004
You didn't perhaps love me.

1695
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:28,883
Maybe I didn't either.

1696
01:27:29,081 --> 01:27:30,206
Because you know what?

1697
01:27:30,365 --> 01:27:33,033
With true love comes responsibility.

1698
01:27:33,633 --> 01:27:35,731
And you never took
that responsibility.

1699
01:27:36,259 --> 01:27:38,425
You always thought about your parents.

1700
01:27:38,676 --> 01:27:39,893
They weren't going to get married.

1701
01:27:39,973 --> 01:27:41,337
We were going to get married.

1702
01:27:41,417 --> 01:27:42,758
And you never thought about that.

1703
01:27:42,987 --> 01:27:43,724
Oh! You think so?

1704
01:27:43,804 --> 01:27:45,783
Don't act smart.

1705
01:27:48,259 --> 01:27:50,253
You never took responsibility.

1706
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:53,251
Alright!

1707
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,756
O god!
-What's going on?

1708
01:27:58,053 --> 01:28:02,612
Anyway, bye. It was nice knowing you.

1709
01:28:12,976 --> 01:28:14,723
They're getting married
day after tomorrow.

1710
01:28:14,944 --> 01:28:16,482
There's just a day in between.

1711
01:28:17,491 --> 01:28:20,355
Have you arranged everything?
- What?

1712
01:28:21,053 --> 01:28:21,975
What do you mean?

1713
01:28:22,555 --> 01:28:24,394
Naihati, Mumbai or Patna?

1714
01:28:24,651 --> 01:28:29,572
How can I think of it at this time?
-Shibu, don't talk.

1715
01:28:30,727 --> 01:28:33,009
Listen to me clearly.

1716
01:28:33,625 --> 01:28:35,525
I won't let you run away.

1717
01:28:37,630 --> 01:28:39,616
Do you love me or not?

1718
01:28:40,689 --> 01:28:41,894
You love me. Right?

1719
01:28:42,530 --> 01:28:47,024
That's it. Now you must
plan and take me out of here..

1720
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,300
..or I'll break your legs.

1721
01:28:49,982 --> 01:28:52,021
Darling, I won't..
- Don't pretend.

1722
01:28:53,019 --> 01:28:54,303
This is not cinema.

1723
01:28:54,766 --> 01:28:56,996
This concerns my life.

1724
01:29:00,215 --> 01:29:04,802
Shibu, I love you a lot.

1725
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,870
I can't live without you.

1726
01:29:08,131 --> 01:29:09,323
Do something.

1727
01:29:09,789 --> 01:29:11,439
We won't get a better chance.

1728
01:29:11,926 --> 01:29:14,586
This is the only chance
to elope from here.

1729
01:29:15,327 --> 01:29:17,978
Everybody will be
busy with the wedding.

1730
01:29:18,097 --> 01:29:20,107
We won't get a better
opportunity, Shibu.

1731
01:29:20,946 --> 01:29:24,317
Money.. I need money.

1732
01:29:24,686 --> 01:29:26,929
How will we manage without money?
Tell me.

1733
01:29:28,166 --> 01:29:30,295
Try to understand me.

1734
01:29:31,496 --> 01:29:34,402
You must think what
to arrange and how.

1735
01:29:34,482 --> 01:29:35,703
You think of it.

1736
01:29:35,915 --> 01:29:37,445
You've just one day.

1737
01:29:37,995 --> 01:29:42,498
If you really love me you
must prove yourself in a day or..

1738
01:29:42,578 --> 01:29:43,433
Or what?

1739
01:29:48,619 --> 01:29:49,617
I'll kill you.

1740
01:30:06,449 --> 01:30:07,499
Sister, take this.

1741
01:30:07,994 --> 01:30:09,241
This is for Saban.

1742
01:30:11,507 --> 01:30:12,596
What happened?

1743
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:18,201
Saban is also my daughter. Isn't it?

1744
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:20,716
I've some duties towards
her irrespective of..

1745
01:30:20,904 --> 01:30:23,192
..whom she gets married to.

1746
01:30:24,706 --> 01:30:26,641
Take this.

1747
01:30:27,666 --> 01:30:29,362
You've to accept this.

1748
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:33,185
At least accept it
as a blessing from me.

1749
01:30:34,414 --> 01:30:38,084
Chaya, you may insist
a lot but I can't accept it.

1750
01:30:39,865 --> 01:30:42,028
After what brother-in-law did..
how can I..

1751
01:30:42,506 --> 01:30:44,691
I can't.
- Why, sister?

1752
01:30:46,146 --> 01:30:50,521
If I was your own sister
could you distance me..

1753
01:30:50,921 --> 01:30:52,416
..for just one quarrel between us?

1754
01:30:52,902 --> 01:30:54,521
What are you saying, Chaya?

1755
01:30:55,810 --> 01:30:57,871
What you did for
me was more than what..

1756
01:30:58,847 --> 01:31:01,080
..my own sister would've done.

1757
01:31:02,533 --> 01:31:04,805
Whenever we were in any trouble..

1758
01:31:05,270 --> 01:31:08,724
..you and brother-in-law supported us.
- Sister..

1759
01:31:08,848 --> 01:31:10,650
You always protected us.

1760
01:31:11,368 --> 01:31:14,733
I'll never be able to pay you back.

1761
01:31:14,936 --> 01:31:18,142
But, if your brother finds out..

1762
01:31:19,037 --> 01:31:20,407
How will he find out?

1763
01:31:20,762 --> 01:31:26,981
Imagine that I gave you everything
before the differences cropped up.

1764
01:31:28,035 --> 01:31:33,751
I would've given all this
to you for Saban and Nicky's wedding.

1765
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:41,070
But the affair with
Arjun cropped up and..

1766
01:31:41,268 --> 01:31:45,850
Well.. Saban is my daughter
and she'll always be my daughter.

1767
01:31:46,101 --> 01:31:49,064
Can't I gift her this much?

1768
01:31:49,281 --> 01:31:51,950
Okay, I accept it.

1769
01:31:52,414 --> 01:31:57,303
But money?
No, Chaya. I can't accept money.

1770
01:31:57,383 --> 01:31:59,172
Not under any circumstance.

1771
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:02,821
Listen..
this money is yours and not mine.

1772
01:32:03,136 --> 01:32:05,770
That's it. Now the decision is yours.

1773
01:32:07,316 --> 01:32:08,392
One more thing.

1774
01:32:08,583 --> 01:32:11,479
Your brother-in-law was supposed
to buy the wedding sweets.

1775
01:32:11,758 --> 01:32:14,038
Think that this is for the sweets.

1776
01:32:16,469 --> 01:32:19,118
But, does brother-in-law
know about this?

1777
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:20,488
Yes, he does.

1778
01:32:20,853 --> 01:32:21,988
He sent the money.

1779
01:32:22,068 --> 01:32:23,321
No..
- Keep quiet.

1780
01:32:23,866 --> 01:32:28,510
I don't think what
is happening is bad.

1781
01:32:30,922 --> 01:32:33,598
It's not always possible for
true love to culminate into marriage.

1782
01:32:36,111 --> 01:32:37,684
This is the very
reason I didn't marry.

1783
01:32:38,167 --> 01:32:39,511
Now you know.

1784
01:32:43,304 --> 01:32:47,894
My father..
my father married at the age of 24.

1785
01:32:48,270 --> 01:32:50,468
Gave birth to three
sons and two daughters..

1786
01:32:50,811 --> 01:32:52,804
..and ran his family very well.

1787
01:32:53,308 --> 01:32:55,430
I'm going to be 38.

1788
01:32:55,510 --> 01:32:58,776
Believe me..
I never thought of getting married.

1789
01:33:00,140 --> 01:33:02,303
Do you know why?
That's because..

1790
01:33:04,863 --> 01:33:06,609
They don't get a better time to call.

1791
01:33:09,489 --> 01:33:10,669
Hello.

1792
01:33:12,133 --> 01:33:16,219
Sir.. yes. I'll go immediately.

1793
01:33:16,781 --> 01:33:18,926
Okay, sir.

1794
01:33:20,757 --> 01:33:22,650
He never pays me but
always keep calling me.

1795
01:33:24,586 --> 01:33:25,513
What was I saying?

1796
01:33:25,947 --> 01:33:26,866
Marriage.

1797
01:33:27,169 --> 01:33:31,655
I was so busy getting people
married that I couldn't marry.

1798
01:33:33,186 --> 01:33:34,625
Why is Manmatha inviting
so many friends?

1799
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:36,011
Tell him to reduce the numbers.

1800
01:33:40,872 --> 01:33:41,481
Sir..

1801
01:33:44,224 --> 01:33:46,598
Listen. Manmatha I useless.

1802
01:33:46,849 --> 01:33:48,383
You and Shibu will
take the wedding gifts.

1803
01:33:49,243 --> 01:33:50,146
Okay, sir.

1804
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,447
Explain everything to Shibu while I..

1805
01:33:55,326 --> 01:33:56,810
What do you mean?

1806
01:33:57,153 --> 01:33:58,712
You also have to take responsibility.

1807
01:33:58,917 --> 01:34:00,819
Just ringing the bell
and taking money won't help.

1808
01:34:00,899 --> 01:34:02,243
Do some work.

1809
01:34:02,828 --> 01:34:04,109
Disgusting!

1810
01:34:05,296 --> 01:34:07,925
What? What's that?

1811
01:34:09,635 --> 01:34:10,656
Which one?

1812
01:34:11,175 --> 01:34:12,968
What's that on your head?

1813
01:34:15,033 --> 01:34:17,065
Get out. Get out.

1814
01:34:20,657 --> 01:34:22,642
He's trying to act
as hero by wearing a wig.

1815
01:34:32,627 --> 01:34:35,642
Felu's mother..
- Yes.

1816
01:34:35,766 --> 01:34:37,392
Get lukewarm water for me.
I want to gargle.

1817
01:34:37,472 --> 01:34:38,572
Nonsense!

1818
01:34:40,939 --> 01:34:41,695
What's this, brother?

1819
01:34:42,282 --> 01:34:44,577
Borda told me to discuss
the payment of sweets with you.

1820
01:34:44,847 --> 01:34:46,959
Are you going to start
practicing music after gargling?

1821
01:34:50,222 --> 01:34:53,914
Brother, after all it's
going to be a wedding night.

1822
01:34:54,623 --> 01:34:56,553
I must sing properly.

1823
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,203
Last time at Ronu di's
daughter's wedding..

1824
01:35:02,808 --> 01:35:05,832
..people loved the songs
I sang on the wedding night.

1825
01:35:06,175 --> 01:35:07,505
They didn't praise the sweets.

1826
01:35:07,837 --> 01:35:09,332
This is also work.

1827
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:12,712
Does marriage mean only gifts,
food and sweets?

1828
01:35:13,247 --> 01:35:14,801
Music also plays an important role.

1829
01:35:15,261 --> 01:35:16,985
The music of wedding night.

1830
01:35:17,578 --> 01:35:20,305
This marks the beginning
of married life.

1831
01:35:21,355 --> 01:35:24,612
What?
- Listen to me carefully.

1832
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:37,120
"That day we two
romanced in the forest.."

1833
01:35:37,577 --> 01:35:44,308
"..on a swing adorned with flowers."

1834
01:35:44,529 --> 01:35:51,179
"That day we two
romanced in the forest.."

1835
01:35:51,678 --> 01:35:57,434
"..on a swing adorned with flowers."

1836
01:35:58,277 --> 01:36:15,921
"Those memories come back
occasionally, I can't forget them."

1837
01:36:16,115 --> 01:36:22,758
"That day we two
romanced in the forest.."

1838
01:36:23,142 --> 01:36:28,884
"..on a swing adorned with flowers."

1839
01:36:29,098 --> 01:36:31,955
Look, I know that my sense
of responsibility is poor.

1840
01:36:32,968 --> 01:36:34,308
I accept it.

1841
01:36:35,155 --> 01:36:37,717
But, it doesn't mean
that I don't love you.

1842
01:36:38,956 --> 01:36:44,287
I thought that you'll
be happy in America.

1843
01:36:45,145 --> 01:36:49,110
Now if you say that you're
ready to suffer with me..

1844
01:36:50,155 --> 01:36:54,895
..if you say that you'll go away
with me and won't care for anything..

1845
01:36:55,963 --> 01:36:59,426
..if you say that you're ready
to live with me despite the problems..

1846
01:37:00,351 --> 01:37:02,662
.. then I have no problem.

1847
01:37:03,349 --> 01:37:05,735
I'm ready to elope with you tomorrow.

1848
01:37:06,899 --> 01:37:09,924
But, you've to live a hard life.

1849
01:37:10,464 --> 01:37:13,902
Both of us will have to toil hard.

1850
01:37:15,181 --> 01:37:19,286
I had made a plan since the
last few days. I thought that..

1851
01:37:20,555 --> 01:37:22,692
I've a friend whose father
own a hotel in Missouri.

1852
01:37:22,891 --> 01:37:27,441
I'll take up a job in the hotel .

1853
01:37:27,917 --> 01:37:30,446
Job of a receptionist..
or something like that.

1854
01:37:30,734 --> 01:37:33,274
I've spoken to him.
He told me to go there.

1855
01:37:33,756 --> 01:37:37,594
If you say then we can leave tomorrow.

1856
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:40,382
There's no problem.

1857
01:37:42,861 --> 01:37:45,332
We'll need money for travelling.

1858
01:37:45,412 --> 01:37:49,307
There are boarding
and food expenses there.

1859
01:37:49,463 --> 01:37:52,891
I've a plan for it.

1860
01:37:53,341 --> 01:37:55,809
Your wedding jewelry..

1861
01:38:05,799 --> 01:38:06,511
Sorry.

1862
01:38:11,749 --> 01:38:13,136
Oh no!

1863
01:38:16,392 --> 01:38:17,532
Hold on.

1864
01:38:19,691 --> 01:38:20,767
Just a minute.

1865
01:38:25,036 --> 01:38:26,235
Hello, Arjun..
- Yes.

1866
01:38:26,315 --> 01:38:30,519
I'm confused about
the wedding gift part.

1867
01:38:30,735 --> 01:38:31,345
What?

1868
01:38:31,566 --> 01:38:33,245
I've forgotten what to say.

1869
01:38:33,486 --> 01:38:34,738
Why didn't you learn it by heart?

1870
01:38:34,818 --> 01:38:37,010
I said everything properly.

1871
01:38:37,152 --> 01:38:38,219
Why didn't you write down, idiot?

1872
01:38:38,299 --> 01:38:41,447
I wrote it down. Yes, I did.

1873
01:38:41,634 --> 01:38:44,297
But, I brought the electric
bill by mistake instead of that paper.

1874
01:38:44,377 --> 01:38:45,166
Electric bill?

1875
01:38:45,974 --> 01:38:47,058
You took an electric bill?

1876
01:38:47,138 --> 01:38:48,705
Who will say the important things?

1877
01:38:48,922 --> 01:38:50,099
You tell me and I'll convey it to her.

1878
01:38:50,216 --> 01:38:51,104
She's right in front of me.

1879
01:38:51,184 --> 01:38:51,872
Listen, tell her..

1880
01:38:52,827 --> 01:38:53,351
Tell me.

1881
01:38:53,507 --> 01:38:54,567
Okay, listen to me.

1882
01:38:54,726 --> 01:38:57,094
Tell her that she need not worry.

1883
01:38:57,364 --> 01:39:00,011
One of your wedding
jewelries will be stolen.

1884
01:39:00,439 --> 01:39:01,285
Don't worry.

1885
01:39:01,529 --> 01:39:03,935
One of the wedding jewelries
will be stolen. Got it?

1886
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:05,654
The most important point.

1887
01:39:05,923 --> 01:39:08,778
Tell her that the jewelry is hers and
they'll be stolen for her well-being.

1888
01:39:08,878 --> 01:39:09,322
Okay.

1889
01:39:09,429 --> 01:39:10,285
Nothing to worry.

1890
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:14,916
The jewelry is yours and they'll
be stolen for your well-being.

1891
01:39:15,403 --> 01:39:16,988
I'm ready to steal for you, Saban.

1892
01:39:17,366 --> 01:39:18,741
Seriously I'm not lying.

1893
01:39:19,007 --> 01:39:20,799
I'm ready to steal for you, Saban.

1894
01:39:20,976 --> 01:39:21,830
Seriously I'm not lying.

1895
01:39:21,910 --> 01:39:24,524
I'll never lie to you, Saban.

1896
01:39:26,268 --> 01:39:28,292
And I'm not ashamed of it, Saban.

1897
01:39:30,419 --> 01:39:32,143
What's the big deal
if the jewelry is stolen?

1898
01:39:32,223 --> 01:39:34,377
When I start earning
I'll return the money.

1899
01:39:35,462 --> 01:39:36,971
Believe me, it's my word.

1900
01:39:38,549 --> 01:39:42,211
And for you I can loot a bank,
forget about jewelry.

1901
01:39:42,291 --> 01:39:44,183
I can loot a bank for you.

1902
01:39:54,848 --> 01:39:57,014
And I'm stealing the
jewelry which is for you..

1903
01:39:57,094 --> 01:39:59,333
..meant for you,
it doesn't make me a thief.

1904
01:39:59,586 --> 01:40:02,499
Not at least in my eyes. Trust me.

1905
01:40:03,248 --> 01:40:05,062
Whatever I have,
whatever I bet it today..

1906
01:40:05,142 --> 01:40:08,608
..whatever I could, I've betted you.
Just for you.

1907
01:40:09,947 --> 01:40:11,870
Just for the sake of love.

1908
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:17,380
Let anyone try to stop me,
my dad or anybody else in the world..

1909
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:19,252
I'll do what I've decided.

1910
01:40:19,332 --> 01:40:20,506
I'll not give it second thought,
I swear.

1911
01:40:20,586 --> 01:40:21,447
I'm not lying.

1912
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:22,393
And what people think of me..

1913
01:40:22,473 --> 01:40:23,863
..I don't give a shit about that,
you know.

1914
01:40:23,943 --> 01:40:25,532
I don't give a shit about
what people think of me.

1915
01:40:25,612 --> 01:40:26,773
To hell with them.

1916
01:40:29,310 --> 01:40:33,982
Saban.. got to decide, man.

1917
01:40:35,167 --> 01:40:36,479
You've got to decide.

1918
01:40:38,460 --> 01:40:40,236
I know it's not easy.

1919
01:40:41,441 --> 01:40:42,842
It's not easy.

1920
01:40:44,387 --> 01:40:48,719
But one thing, one thing I promise.

1921
01:40:50,031 --> 01:40:51,492
It's gonna be wonderful.

1922
01:40:52,979 --> 01:40:54,226
It's gonna be awesome.

1923
01:41:01,174 --> 01:41:15,097
"You're well aware that my meaningless
words filled the air that day."

1924
01:41:15,177 --> 01:41:29,278
"You're well aware that my meaningless
words filled the air that day."

1925
01:41:29,486 --> 01:41:46,598
"The sky was adorned
with your smiles."

1926
01:41:46,734 --> 01:41:49,948
"That day we two romanced...
-Everything will be fine.

1927
01:41:50,242 --> 01:41:53,147
...in the forest.."
-Let's go.

1928
01:41:53,964 --> 01:42:00,065
"..on a swing adorned with flowers."

1929
01:42:00,833 --> 01:42:02,564
Why are you so stressed?

1930
01:42:03,053 --> 01:42:04,845
Everything will be fine.
We're with you.

1931
01:42:05,324 --> 01:42:08,697
I'll leave now. I'm getting late.

1932
01:42:09,607 --> 01:42:10,334
Bye.

1933
01:42:10,736 --> 01:42:14,518
Listen..
I wanted to tell you something.

1934
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:19,207
I should've given some
gift on your wedding.

1935
01:42:19,730 --> 01:42:21,573
I had planned to give you
a gift but there's a problem.

1936
01:42:21,653 --> 01:42:23,165
I don't have money.

1937
01:42:23,954 --> 01:42:25,557
I don't' have money. I have nothing.

1938
01:42:25,806 --> 01:42:27,953
So, I got an idea yesterday.

1939
01:42:28,033 --> 01:42:30,505
I had this with me.

1940
01:42:31,225 --> 01:42:34,452
Somebody had gifted
it to me when I was a child.

1941
01:42:35,525 --> 01:42:36,736
I don't even wear it.

1942
01:42:37,505 --> 01:42:38,426
It was lying unused.

1943
01:42:39,542 --> 01:42:41,269
It's made of gold. Keep it.

1944
01:42:42,692 --> 01:42:44,798
You'll get money for it.
You'll get 5000 bucks for it.

1945
01:42:45,315 --> 01:42:47,030
Keep it. it's going to help.

1946
01:42:47,349 --> 01:42:49,842
You've lot of expenses.
Keep it. It'll help you.

1947
01:42:50,072 --> 01:42:52,056
I would've given you a wedding gift.

1948
01:42:52,329 --> 01:42:53,148
This is the gift from me.

1949
01:42:53,382 --> 01:42:55,841
I don't have anything else
right now to gift you. Okay?

1950
01:42:56,810 --> 01:42:57,984
It'll help you.

1951
01:42:59,494 --> 01:43:01,203
What happened?

1952
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,732
Why are you crying?

1953
01:43:04,312 --> 01:43:05,483
Don't cry like this.

1954
01:43:05,982 --> 01:43:07,268
What's your problem?

1955
01:43:07,547 --> 01:43:09,636
You're getting married to Saban.

1956
01:43:10,105 --> 01:43:11,956
You're getting married to Saban,
brother.

1957
01:43:12,515 --> 01:43:14,268
Don't cry. What happened?

1958
01:43:14,542 --> 01:43:17,969
Are you okay? Okay?

1959
01:43:18,319 --> 01:43:20,302
Come on. Come on, buddy.

1960
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:21,511
It's okay.

1961
01:43:47,003 --> 01:43:58,908
"The moon appeared in the sky when
I was walking on a full moon night."

1962
01:44:00,934 --> 01:44:12,208
"I don't know how divine
the moment was when we met."

1963
01:44:14,887 --> 01:44:20,145
"The moon appeared in the sky."

1964
01:44:21,911 --> 01:44:28,598
"My time is over."

1965
01:44:28,930 --> 01:44:35,815
"I'll carry the burden
of solitude all alone."

1966
01:44:35,895 --> 01:44:42,892
"My time is over."

1967
01:44:43,021 --> 01:44:49,744
"I'll carry the burden
of solitude all alone."

1968
01:44:49,933 --> 01:44:56,787
"The strings that
I've bound you with.."

1969
01:44:56,952 --> 01:45:07,363
"..please don't sever the bond."

1970
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:14,482
"That day we two
romanced in the forest.."

1971
01:45:14,821 --> 01:45:21,314
"..on a swing adorned with flowers."

1972
01:45:21,541 --> 01:45:28,335
"That day we two
romanced in the forest.."

1973
01:45:28,784 --> 01:45:35,116
"..on a swing adorned with flowers."

1974
01:45:37,223 --> 01:45:38,530
Come in. come in.

1975
01:45:38,663 --> 01:45:41,884
This is the courtyard.

1976
01:45:42,376 --> 01:45:45,787
You can see that a pandal
has been constructed here.

1977
01:45:46,422 --> 01:45:48,855
You can at least
take the measurements.

1978
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:49,767
Isn't it?
- Yes.

1979
01:45:49,847 --> 01:45:51,723
Can we go to the terrace?
- Terrace?

1980
01:45:53,140 --> 01:45:54,516
Yes. We can go.

1981
01:45:54,596 --> 01:45:56,372
We'll be able to get a better
idea if we go to the terrace.

1982
01:45:56,452 --> 01:45:57,261
Okay.

1983
01:45:57,654 --> 01:46:00,611
Shibu, call brother.

1984
01:46:00,795 --> 01:46:01,827
We want to go to the terrace.
- Go.

1985
01:46:02,187 --> 01:46:03,375
Go and call him.

1986
01:46:03,792 --> 01:46:05,277
The wedding is taking place today.

1987
01:46:05,357 --> 01:46:07,016
Why did you choose
this day to come here?

1988
01:46:07,216 --> 01:46:08,379
We told you to call brother.

1989
01:46:08,503 --> 01:46:10,859
Brother! Borda!

1990
01:46:11,041 --> 01:46:11,899
Brother..

1991
01:46:12,436 --> 01:46:13,225
What's this?

1992
01:46:13,578 --> 01:46:14,321
What do you want?

1993
01:46:14,488 --> 01:46:18,149
Brother, they're Mr. Sharma's men.

1994
01:46:18,229 --> 01:46:21,371
They've come to take
a look at the house..

1995
01:46:21,451 --> 01:46:23,280
..and take measurements.

1996
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,306
Isn't it?
- Yes.

1997
01:46:24,671 --> 01:46:25,680
It won't take long.

1998
01:46:25,808 --> 01:46:26,888
It's a matter of an hour.

1999
01:46:26,968 --> 01:46:28,535
They'll take the
measurements and leave.

2000
01:46:29,169 --> 01:46:30,748
How dare Mr. Sharma do this?

2001
01:46:30,972 --> 01:46:32,881
How could he send people to measure
the place without informing me?

2002
01:46:32,961 --> 01:46:35,371
Why are you losing your cool, brother?

2003
01:46:35,451 --> 01:46:38,055
It's hardly going
to take them an hour.

2004
01:46:39,135 --> 01:46:41,592
Get out. Get out right now.

2005
01:46:42,087 --> 01:46:43,494
What's going on?

2006
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:45,325
We've a wedding in the family today.

2007
01:46:45,762 --> 01:46:47,065
What are you up to?

2008
01:46:47,239 --> 01:46:48,486
Get out now.

2009
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,222
It'll hardly take an hour.

2010
01:46:51,972 --> 01:46:53,332
I can't come later.

2011
01:46:53,762 --> 01:46:55,610
I told you to go out, Keshto.

2012
01:46:55,838 --> 01:46:56,957
Get out.

2013
01:46:57,216 --> 01:47:00,734
Brother, lower your voice.

2014
01:47:02,007 --> 01:47:06,430
I respect you and so
I don't wish to say anything.

2015
01:47:06,554 --> 01:47:07,684
Isn't it?
- Yes.

2016
01:47:09,378 --> 01:47:13,172
While signing the paper
you should've given it a thought.

2017
01:47:13,810 --> 01:47:15,337
What was written in the paper?

2018
01:47:15,510 --> 01:47:21,535
The company can send
their men any time for work.

2019
01:47:21,955 --> 01:47:24,119
Why didn't you read it properly?

2020
01:47:24,501 --> 01:47:26,564
I could've come in the evening.

2021
01:47:26,843 --> 01:47:29,107
But, the wedding is
scheduled in the evening.

2022
01:47:29,187 --> 01:47:29,997
Isn't it?
- Yes. Absolutely right.

2023
01:47:30,077 --> 01:47:31,970
So, I've come in the morning.

2024
01:47:33,845 --> 01:47:37,014
Tell Shibu to open
the door of the terrace.

2025
01:47:37,094 --> 01:47:37,811
Tell him.

2026
01:47:37,964 --> 01:47:39,739
Shibu! Shibu!

2027
01:47:40,436 --> 01:47:41,413
Hey Shibu!

2028
01:47:41,493 --> 01:47:43,080
How dare you? I will.

2029
01:47:43,418 --> 01:47:45,015
Hey! What are you doing?

2030
01:47:51,044 --> 01:47:52,934
Arjun! Arjun! Come quickly.

2031
01:47:53,014 --> 01:47:53,928
Quick. Hurry up.

2032
01:47:54,008 --> 01:47:54,447
Where?

2033
01:47:54,587 --> 01:47:56,364
There's problem in Saban's house.

2034
01:47:56,444 --> 01:47:58,033
There's trouble there.
- So what?

2035
01:47:58,216 --> 01:48:00,246
Keshto and his men have come there.

2036
01:48:00,326 --> 01:48:01,164
They're creating problems.

2037
01:48:01,244 --> 01:48:02,166
Please try to understand.

2038
01:48:04,676 --> 01:48:06,278
What are you thinking of?

2039
01:48:07,608 --> 01:48:09,493
They'll be in trouble, bro.

2040
01:48:12,772 --> 01:48:14,245
Let's go.

2041
01:48:15,403 --> 01:48:16,020
Let's go.

2042
01:48:16,338 --> 01:48:17,756
C'mon, let's go.

2043
01:48:22,602 --> 01:48:24,078
You'll get out of
this house right now.

2044
01:48:24,478 --> 01:48:26,561
You'll get out right now.
-I won't go.

2045
01:48:27,209 --> 01:48:30,240
We'll follow what's written
in the legal documents.

2046
01:48:30,659 --> 01:48:32,153
You'll give me the
keys to the terrace.

2047
01:48:32,233 --> 01:48:35,255
I'll open the terrace door,
measure the area..

2048
01:48:35,365 --> 01:48:36,315
..and then I'll leave.

2049
01:48:36,395 --> 01:48:38,805
What will you do? What will you do?

2050
01:48:39,526 --> 01:48:43,525
Borda, this is not going to be good.

2051
01:48:43,605 --> 01:48:45,294
What are you staring at,
brother-in-law?

2052
01:48:45,374 --> 01:48:46,320
Take your brother inside.

2053
01:48:46,400 --> 01:48:47,545
Nobody will go anywhere.

2054
01:48:47,973 --> 01:48:49,199
This house is still mine.

2055
01:48:49,348 --> 01:48:50,109
Unless I vacate the house..

2056
01:48:50,189 --> 01:48:53,385
..I won't let Sharma
or his men enter the house.

2057
01:48:53,782 --> 01:48:55,627
Go and close the main gate.
- Yes.

2058
01:48:55,707 --> 01:48:56,532
I'll call the police.

2059
01:48:56,612 --> 01:48:57,793
We'll decide the rest later.

2060
01:48:58,846 --> 01:48:59,509
Police?

2061
01:49:01,220 --> 01:49:02,789
You'll call the police?

2062
01:49:03,398 --> 01:49:08,285
Okay. I'll dial their number.
You can speak with them.

2063
01:49:08,414 --> 01:49:10,296
Hyena, take out the legal document.

2064
01:49:10,490 --> 01:49:12,446
You don't have to take out anything.

2065
01:49:18,289 --> 01:49:20,607
You and your men must
get out of here right now.

2066
01:49:23,081 --> 01:49:24,851
Who are you to order me?

2067
01:49:25,072 --> 01:49:27,024
You need not know.

2068
01:49:28,182 --> 01:49:30,041
Just get the hell out of here. Okay?

2069
01:49:31,294 --> 01:49:32,818
What will you do if I don't?

2070
01:49:33,448 --> 01:49:34,894
Will you also call the police?

2071
01:49:36,244 --> 01:49:36,918
I'll thrash you.

2072
01:49:36,998 --> 01:49:38,614
Hyena da, get out of here.

2073
01:49:43,884 --> 01:49:45,715
So, you want to thrash me?

2074
01:49:46,909 --> 01:49:48,418
What's going on here?

2075
01:49:48,562 --> 01:49:50,223
Come on, thrash me.

2076
01:49:50,303 --> 01:49:51,019
Arjun!

2077
01:49:53,016 --> 01:49:54,550
Keshto, this is not right.
Let me warn you.

2078
01:49:56,474 --> 01:49:57,276
Sister-in-law..

2079
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,775
Keshto, he'll die.

2080
01:49:58,855 --> 01:50:00,162
What's going on?
-Leave him.

2081
01:50:08,104 --> 01:50:10,827
I've carried him in
my arms since childhood.

2082
01:50:12,210 --> 01:50:14,142
And he wants to thrash me.

2083
01:50:16,021 --> 01:50:17,127
It's all because of you.

2084
01:50:17,588 --> 01:50:21,286
Your name is Pashu (animal)
and you behave like one.

2085
01:50:22,581 --> 01:50:24,978
I beat him because of you.

2086
01:50:25,447 --> 01:50:26,795
Sorry.

2087
01:50:28,106 --> 01:50:29,914
I feel disturbed.

2088
01:50:30,233 --> 01:50:34,777
Hyena, c'mon pack up.

2089
01:50:34,857 --> 01:50:36,501
He spoilt my mood.
Let's go.

2090
01:50:36,581 --> 01:50:37,768
Let's go. come on.

2091
01:50:41,285 --> 01:50:42,440
Arjun, what are you doing?

2092
01:50:44,769 --> 01:50:45,662
Arjun..

2093
01:50:45,804 --> 01:50:47,353
Tell him to stop.

2094
01:50:47,433 --> 01:50:48,371
Arjun, please go.

2095
01:50:48,451 --> 01:50:49,711
Why did you interfere?

2096
01:50:50,267 --> 01:50:51,032
Leave him.

2097
01:50:52,012 --> 01:50:52,988
Brother-in-law,
please try to stop them.

2098
01:50:53,142 --> 01:50:53,750
Hey!

2099
01:50:55,803 --> 01:50:56,841
What's going on?

2100
01:50:58,420 --> 01:50:59,047
Shibu!

2101
01:50:59,433 --> 01:51:02,067
Hey Arjun! What's going on?
-I said leave him.

2102
01:51:02,180 --> 01:51:04,037
What are you doing?

2103
01:51:04,117 --> 01:51:05,276
I'll call the police.

2104
01:51:12,278 --> 01:51:13,165
Arjun!

2105
01:51:13,245 --> 01:51:13,893
What's happening?

2106
01:51:13,973 --> 01:51:15,906
I told you to stop.
What are you doing?

2107
01:51:16,455 --> 01:51:17,674
No!

2108
01:51:17,754 --> 01:51:19,264
Arjun, go from here.

2109
01:51:20,987 --> 01:51:23,028
He is not listening.

2110
01:51:24,740 --> 01:51:26,077
Hey Arjun!

2111
01:51:28,742 --> 01:51:29,986
Brother-in-law!
Shibu!

2112
01:51:33,509 --> 01:51:34,835
Enough. Leave him.

2113
01:51:35,613 --> 01:51:37,784
Arjun! Arjun!

2114
01:51:39,043 --> 01:51:40,566
Get up, you asshole.

2115
01:51:42,337 --> 01:51:43,029
Hey!

2116
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:45,938
Get out of here.

2117
01:51:46,899 --> 01:51:47,786
Get out.

2118
01:51:48,475 --> 01:51:50,620
Out. Get out of here.

2119
01:51:52,282 --> 01:51:58,035
Never step inside this
house or I'll shoot you, bastard.

2120
01:52:00,482 --> 01:52:03,030
Out. Get out.

2121
01:52:16,253 --> 01:52:18,998
Arjun.. Arjun..

2122
01:52:25,059 --> 01:52:27,278
Hey! Where is he?

2123
01:52:28,509 --> 01:52:29,620
Tell me where he is.

2124
01:52:29,744 --> 01:52:31,227
Upstairs in the cabin.

2125
01:52:31,475 --> 01:52:32,580
You're just too much, rascals.

2126
01:52:36,713 --> 01:52:37,353
How is he?

2127
01:52:37,433 --> 01:52:39,471
Doctor, how is he now?

2128
01:52:39,848 --> 01:52:42,097
We can't say anything at the moment.

2129
01:52:42,177 --> 01:52:44,990
It's a serious injury.
He has lost lot of blood.

2130
01:52:45,150 --> 01:52:47,060
His blood group is very rare.
A negative.

2131
01:52:47,187 --> 01:52:48,371
We don't have blood
of this group in stock.

2132
01:52:48,451 --> 01:52:49,976
Does any of you have this blood group?

2133
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:50,959
A negative.

2134
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:51,965
What's my blood group?

2135
01:52:52,045 --> 01:52:53,760
I'm O positive.

2136
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:55,098
Will you check my group?

2137
01:52:55,178 --> 01:52:56,917
We'll need a lot of blood.

2138
01:52:57,177 --> 01:52:58,369
I think I'm A negative.

2139
01:52:58,832 --> 01:52:59,873
Will you check it?

2140
01:53:00,139 --> 01:53:02,069
Mr. Ghoish, are you okay?

2141
01:53:02,263 --> 01:53:03,844
Hope you're not feeling uneasy.

2142
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,872
Don't be in a hurry.

2143
01:53:07,554 --> 01:53:09,321
Take rest and go home in the evening.

2144
01:53:09,480 --> 01:53:10,777
Lie down and rest for some time.

2145
01:53:23,146 --> 01:53:26,343
Believe me, I never thought
that the story would take..

2146
01:53:26,423 --> 01:53:28,126
..such an unsuspecting turn.

2147
01:53:30,145 --> 01:53:35,084
But I guessed that the
story would turn out to be..

2148
01:53:36,458 --> 01:53:39,525
..like the movies that
are screened in Ganesh Talkies

2149
01:53:40,672 --> 01:53:41,623
How could I?

2150
01:53:43,222 --> 01:53:45,364
It's because of our locality.

2151
01:53:46,694 --> 01:53:47,579
The Chitpur locality.

2152
01:53:48,266 --> 01:53:50,602
Chitpur is famous as theatre locality.

2153
01:53:51,254 --> 01:53:55,733
It isn't surprising if the
end of our story is a dramatic one.

2154
01:53:59,287 --> 01:54:00,215
What happened?

2155
01:54:00,410 --> 01:54:02,768
Go upstairs and check
if he's alive or dead.

2156
01:54:22,890 --> 01:54:27,402
Arjun.. marry Saban.

2157
01:54:29,080 --> 01:54:30,749
Elope with her.

2158
01:54:32,254 --> 01:54:34,234
Do what you wish to.

2159
01:54:35,008 --> 01:54:37,496
But, come back.

2160
01:54:43,127 --> 01:54:45,551
I don't have a son.

2161
01:54:47,715 --> 01:54:49,597
But I never missed having one.

2162
01:54:52,315 --> 01:54:54,424
Please forgive me.

2163
01:54:56,621 --> 01:54:59,484
Arjun, come back.

2164
01:55:01,156 --> 01:55:03,126
Come back.

2165
01:55:16,402 --> 01:55:18,735
Come. Come. Please come.

2166
01:55:19,935 --> 01:55:20,736
Come in.

2167
01:55:21,228 --> 01:55:22,330
How are you now?

2168
01:55:23,314 --> 01:55:24,696
How are you feeling now?

2169
01:55:25,426 --> 01:55:26,840
Come. Come.
Please be seated.

2170
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,881
Where's your elder brother?
- he's at home.

2171
01:55:29,163 --> 01:55:31,456
Have a seat, I'll call him.

2172
01:55:31,978 --> 01:55:36,407
Sister-in-law.
Brother. Ghosh da has come.

2173
01:55:36,905 --> 01:55:38,490
It's okay.

2174
01:55:39,493 --> 01:55:41,380
Tell them that their son
has regained consciousness.

2175
01:55:42,381 --> 01:55:43,645
He's fine now.

2176
01:55:45,367 --> 01:55:46,419
Brother..

2177
01:55:56,157 --> 01:55:57,213
How is Arjun?

2178
01:55:57,390 --> 01:56:00,832
He has regained consciousness.
- Thank god.

2179
01:56:01,291 --> 01:56:04,217
He's in his senses.
- That's good.

2180
01:56:05,358 --> 01:56:06,445
He's fine.

2181
01:56:11,443 --> 01:56:15,993
Brother.. please be seated.

2182
01:56:16,753 --> 01:56:18,881
You don't seem to be well.

2183
01:56:18,961 --> 01:56:21,191
Come. Come. Have a seat.

2184
01:56:21,471 --> 01:56:22,625
It's your house also.

2185
01:56:22,705 --> 01:56:25,255
Come. Please. Please eat something.

2186
01:56:25,681 --> 01:56:27,503
Everybody in my house
haven't eaten anything.

2187
01:56:28,388 --> 01:56:30,155
They must be worried.

2188
01:56:30,462 --> 01:56:31,794
I'll leave now.
Let's go.

2189
01:56:37,555 --> 01:56:38,564
Please stop him.

2190
01:56:44,378 --> 01:56:46,978
The work is going at a very slow pace.
I want some energy.

2191
01:56:48,191 --> 01:56:51,468
Come. Come.
Come, Mr. Pravin.

2192
01:56:52,077 --> 01:56:55,114
I knew that I would get
to meet you some day even if..

2193
01:56:55,338 --> 01:56:57,123
..it's for a short while.

2194
01:56:57,444 --> 01:57:01,355
When Mr. Navin told me
that you wanted to meet me..

2195
01:57:01,555 --> 01:57:04,444
..I just remembered one thing.

2196
01:57:05,199 --> 01:57:06,257
Community.

2197
01:57:08,269 --> 01:57:10,519
You understand what community means.

2198
01:57:10,762 --> 01:57:13,695
Brother, community..
both are the same.

2199
01:57:13,911 --> 01:57:16,747
We don't care who's a
Bong or a Bihari or Marwari.

2200
01:57:17,372 --> 01:57:20,272
But community is something different.

2201
01:57:20,659 --> 01:57:23,140
You wanted to see the deed
signed by Pashupati Ghosh. Isn't it?

2202
01:57:23,504 --> 01:57:24,274
Here it is.

2203
01:57:24,354 --> 01:57:27,613
This is the deed of
the Pashupati mansion.

2204
01:57:28,420 --> 01:57:29,548
Take a look.

2205
01:57:31,059 --> 01:57:34,113
I also have the deed
of Ganesh Talkies.

2206
01:57:35,263 --> 01:57:38,612
Mr. Navin told me that you want
to check both the deeds in detail.

2207
01:57:38,777 --> 01:57:40,676
Who is getting the better deal? Huh?

2208
01:57:41,733 --> 01:57:42,463
Here it is.

2209
01:57:42,862 --> 01:57:46,484
This is the deed of Ganesh Talkies.

2210
01:57:47,873 --> 01:57:51,890
No need to sign it now. Take it home.

2211
01:57:52,117 --> 01:57:54,531
Go through it carefully
and then you can sign it.

2212
01:57:56,546 --> 01:57:59,015
But, let me tell you
that this is the best deal.

2213
01:58:00,035 --> 01:58:01,782
How is your son?

2214
01:58:02,481 --> 01:58:03,976
I heard that he has come home.

2215
01:58:05,749 --> 01:58:07,205
Mr. Pravin,
changes are bound to happen..

2216
01:58:07,386 --> 01:58:08,799
..even if we don't want them.

2217
01:58:09,055 --> 01:58:14,375
We'll break the old mansions
and build malls there.

2218
01:58:14,536 --> 01:58:15,338
Isn't it?

2219
01:58:15,418 --> 01:58:18,361
For example,
my dad's dad, I mean my grandfather..

2220
01:58:18,441 --> 01:58:20,008
..he was a farmer in Bihar.

2221
01:58:20,486 --> 01:58:23,531
My dad sold the land
and shifted to Kolkata.

2222
01:58:24,134 --> 01:58:27,754
I did my graduation from St.
Xavier's college.

2223
01:58:28,047 --> 01:58:31,452
There's a famous song by Bob Dylan.

2224
01:58:32,113 --> 01:58:33,658
Time that is changing..

2225
01:58:33,738 --> 01:58:36,166
It's a famous English song.

2226
01:58:36,246 --> 01:58:37,450
Have you heard it?

2227
01:58:37,716 --> 01:58:39,748
A famous Hindi film was made.

2228
01:58:40,227 --> 01:58:42,081
'Dosti'. Did you watch it?

2229
01:58:42,728 --> 01:58:44,418
It was a hit. Super hit.

2230
01:58:45,026 --> 01:58:46,819
The film featured very
nice songs sung by Mohd. Rafi.

2231
01:58:49,050 --> 01:58:51,409
I made a Bengali remake of that film.

2232
01:58:51,862 --> 01:58:56,262
'Bondhu'. But it flopped. Super flop.
It didn't work.

2233
01:58:56,986 --> 01:58:57,838
Ask me why.

2234
01:58:58,031 --> 01:59:02,276
That's because.. if you
don't mind I would say something.

2235
01:59:02,356 --> 01:59:06,362
It was an old idea.
- No.. no..

2236
01:59:07,307 --> 01:59:12,000
It's flopped because the
Hindi film was the original one.

2237
01:59:13,117 --> 01:59:15,640
The one I made was fake.

2238
01:59:17,625 --> 01:59:20,343
What's real and what's fake..

2239
01:59:20,918 --> 01:59:22,930
What's old and what's new..

2240
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:25,766
..you need to understand it.
Isn't it?

2241
01:59:27,432 --> 01:59:33,596
For example,
Pashupati's mansion is old for you.

2242
01:59:34,286 --> 01:59:36,040
But for me it's the original one.

2243
01:59:36,518 --> 01:59:41,228
And this deed you
see here is new for you..

2244
01:59:42,152 --> 01:59:44,415
..but it is fake for me.

2245
01:59:46,410 --> 01:59:47,683
What are you doing?

2246
01:59:47,860 --> 01:59:49,411
What are you doing?

2247
01:59:49,548 --> 01:59:52,396
Look.. listen to me.. you..

2248
01:59:52,627 --> 01:59:54,628
What are you doing?
Listen to me.

2249
01:59:55,134 --> 01:59:56,721
This is wrong.

2250
01:59:58,396 --> 01:59:59,906
This is real friendship.

2251
02:00:00,477 --> 02:00:01,673
Are you mad?

2252
02:00:02,248 --> 02:00:03,337
You burnt it?

2253
02:00:03,886 --> 02:00:05,662
Do you understand
what friendship means?

2254
02:00:07,788 --> 02:00:12,194
Right now I'm making the film
that I couldn't make in the past.

2255
02:00:12,971 --> 02:00:14,020
Dosti (friendship).

2256
02:00:15,113 --> 02:00:16,937
Navin..
- Yes, brother.

2257
02:00:27,279 --> 02:00:31,919
This bag contains the full amount
of money that you gave to Pashupati.

2258
02:00:34,648 --> 02:00:35,642
The deal is over now.

2259
02:00:36,820 --> 02:00:38,325
You've got your money.

2260
02:00:38,984 --> 02:00:40,233
There's no deal now.

2261
02:00:41,534 --> 02:00:44,962
The old things will continue.

2262
02:00:46,636 --> 02:00:53,943
Pashupati's house
will remain as it is.

2263
02:00:55,755 --> 02:00:57,118
Got it?

2264
02:00:58,654 --> 02:01:01,989
Navin, I've explained
him in my language.

2265
02:01:02,550 --> 02:01:04,105
Now explain to him
in your American language.

2266
02:01:04,185 --> 02:01:04,945
Okay, brother.

2267
02:01:05,151 --> 02:01:09,176
Well buddy,
now you better sign this deed.

2268
02:01:09,699 --> 02:01:13,751
It's written here that Mr.
Pashupati Ghosh owes you nothing.

2269
02:01:13,941 --> 02:01:15,429
And you owe him nothing.

2270
02:01:15,771 --> 02:01:16,581
Got it?

2271
02:01:16,983 --> 02:01:17,890
And one more thing.

2272
02:01:18,358 --> 02:01:20,514
You're talking a lot about pictures.

2273
02:01:20,652 --> 02:01:23,038
The picture is kind of
becoming clear for me too.

2274
02:01:23,715 --> 02:01:25,020
Let me tell you something.

2275
02:01:25,410 --> 02:01:27,664
I was in America. I was out of work.

2276
02:01:28,181 --> 02:01:31,250
So, I decided to come
back to India and make it here.

2277
02:01:31,647 --> 02:01:33,724
But, this is India.

2278
02:01:34,120 --> 02:01:35,347
This is India.

2279
02:01:35,635 --> 02:01:39,886
We've history, culture, traditions.

2280
02:01:39,966 --> 02:01:42,152
It's a rich and complex society.

2281
02:01:42,568 --> 02:01:44,476
There are time honoured
practices here.

2282
02:01:44,764 --> 02:01:47,062
Shortcuts don't work here, buddy.

2283
02:01:47,391 --> 02:01:49,649
There are no shortcuts here. Got it?

2284
02:01:50,531 --> 02:01:56,521
Well, that's the reason I've
decided to take up Ganesh Talkies..

2285
02:01:57,022 --> 02:01:59,275
..as a single screen.

2286
02:01:59,696 --> 02:02:04,528
I'll build something
around that foundation.

2287
02:02:04,804 --> 02:02:07,249
Have you seen Priya Cinema hall.

2288
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:08,633
Something like Priya cinema..

2289
02:02:08,775 --> 02:02:12,405
To build something around it that's
going to attract a lot of people.

2290
02:02:12,595 --> 02:02:13,627
Got it?

2291
02:02:14,374 --> 02:02:17,754
As far as Pashupati
house is concerned..

2292
02:02:18,272 --> 02:02:22,644
..you better sign that
deed otherwise my brother is..

2293
02:02:22,827 --> 02:02:24,759
..going to make you
an offer you can't refuse.

2294
02:02:25,700 --> 02:02:26,713
What's the offer?

2295
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:28,943
It's very simple.

2296
02:02:29,596 --> 02:02:33,438
Either sign or jump down the terrace.

2297
02:02:33,792 --> 02:02:36,143
Hyena..
- Yes. - Give the revolver.

2298
02:02:38,078 --> 02:02:40,292
I've spoken to Pashu da.

2299
02:02:40,661 --> 02:02:43,511
He'll vacate the ground
floor for my office.

2300
02:02:44,153 --> 02:02:46,203
You won't get his house now.

2301
02:02:46,491 --> 02:02:48,974
Look for some other property.
I'll vacate it.

2302
02:02:49,272 --> 02:02:50,652
End this matter here.

2303
02:02:53,676 --> 02:02:54,685
Hyena..
- Yes.

2304
02:02:56,045 --> 02:02:59,133
What happened? Sign.

2305
02:03:05,384 --> 02:03:06,728
Sign it.

2306
02:03:09,364 --> 02:03:10,314
Come on, sign it.

2307
02:03:14,079 --> 02:03:18,166
Or you'll hear about
a young promoter's death..

2308
02:03:18,520 --> 02:03:23,634
..due to an accidental
fall from a ten storied building.

2309
02:03:25,144 --> 02:03:28,161
This Is going to be tomorrow's
newspaper headlines.

2310
02:03:31,275 --> 02:03:34,521
Sad news and bad news.

2311
02:03:39,406 --> 02:03:40,630
Sign it.

2312
02:03:54,509 --> 02:03:59,132
"It'll be dawn every
morning and night at dusk."

2313
02:03:59,577 --> 02:04:04,045
"But the time in between
will change lot of fates."

2314
02:04:04,545 --> 02:04:09,128
"The people who're here
today won't be here tomorrow."

2315
02:04:09,509 --> 02:04:14,251
"Surname and address will change."

2316
02:04:14,561 --> 02:04:17,040
"What is destined will happen."

2317
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:19,529
"Changes are bound to happen."

2318
02:04:19,609 --> 02:04:23,694
"Que sera sera sera."

2319
02:04:24,098 --> 02:04:26,720
"We'll have to change."

2320
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:29,233
"What'll stay and what will not."

2321
02:04:29,313 --> 02:04:33,667
"Such calculations won't help."

2322
02:04:34,230 --> 02:04:36,542
"Time is passing."

2323
02:04:36,741 --> 02:04:39,221
"The heart is decaying."

2324
02:04:39,588 --> 02:04:44,221
"The world is changing."

2325
02:04:44,333 --> 02:04:49,549
"Let's change ourselves
in the mean time."

2326
02:04:49,629 --> 02:04:53,658
"Que sera sera sera."

2327
02:04:56,879 --> 02:04:58,367
Hey you!

2328
02:04:59,362 --> 02:05:00,880
Come in.

2329
02:05:01,258 --> 02:05:03,018
Coming.

2330
02:05:03,519 --> 02:05:04,403
Keshto!

2331
02:05:06,933 --> 02:05:08,892
What happened?
Come.

2332
02:05:09,954 --> 02:05:12,415
Khagen da, want to have a smoke?

2333
02:05:14,652 --> 02:05:15,287
Take it quickly.

2334
02:05:15,367 --> 02:05:16,852
You're offering me smoke? Go.

2335
02:05:21,589 --> 02:05:23,668
When the story has
taken such a big turn..

2336
02:05:24,152 --> 02:05:26,427
..why not let it take
another turn. Right?

2337
02:05:27,741 --> 02:05:29,926
Since I'm narrating the story.

2338
02:05:30,729 --> 02:05:33,368
Let me fulfill a wish of mine. Right?

2339
02:05:35,739 --> 02:05:38,529
This story was about a wedding
and you've already seen it.

2340
02:05:39,365 --> 02:05:43,235
There can't be any problem
if we've two marriages instead of one.

2341
02:05:44,466 --> 02:05:49,686
Do you've any problem? No? Okay.

2342
02:05:50,703 --> 02:05:54,596
Moreover, they disregarded
all the auspicious time and all..

2343
02:05:54,676 --> 02:05:57,756
..and they're getting
married on the day when..

2344
02:05:57,836 --> 02:06:00,015
..the wedding reception was scheduled.

2345
02:06:00,965 --> 02:06:02,092
Do you know why?

2346
02:06:04,124 --> 02:06:06,962
That's because the two families don't
want to remove the wedding pandal.

2347
02:06:08,831 --> 02:06:12,203
Look, since they're
going against the rules..

2348
02:06:12,822 --> 02:06:14,755
..let them break some more rules.

2349
02:06:15,853 --> 02:06:17,657
There is another pair of
hero and heroine in the story.

2350
02:06:18,993 --> 02:06:20,589
Can you see her?

2351
02:06:20,823 --> 02:06:21,851
She's the second heroine.

2352
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:24,724
Let their story also
have a happy ending.

2353
02:06:25,436 --> 02:06:29,731
"It'll be dawn every
morning and night at dusk."

2354
02:06:30,519 --> 02:06:35,076
"But the time in between
will change lot of fates."

2355
02:06:35,506 --> 02:06:39,814
"The people who're here
today won't be here tomorrow."

2356
02:06:40,531 --> 02:06:44,793
"Surname and address will change."

2357
02:06:45,499 --> 02:06:47,953
"What is destined will happen."

2358
02:06:48,033 --> 02:06:50,397
"Changes are bound to happen."

2359
02:06:50,477 --> 02:06:54,704
"Que sera sera sera."

2360
02:06:55,107 --> 02:06:57,441
"We'll have to change."

2361
02:06:57,698 --> 02:07:00,137
"What'll stay and what will not."

2362
02:07:00,217 --> 02:07:04,556
"Such calculations won't help."

2363
02:07:05,203 --> 02:07:07,621
"Time is passing."

2364
02:07:07,701 --> 02:07:10,101
"The heart is decaying."

2365
02:07:10,533 --> 02:07:15,176
"The world is changing."

2366
02:07:15,256 --> 02:07:20,492
"Let's change ourselves
in the mean time."

2367
02:07:20,572 --> 02:07:24,969
"Que sera sera sera."

2368
02:07:30,554 --> 02:07:34,926
"Who cares who's Hindu
or Japanese or who's dark?"

2369
02:07:35,569 --> 02:07:40,107
"Who cares for the ailing
whom we're tired of?"

2370
02:07:40,566 --> 02:07:45,430
"Who cares the politics
one is involved in?"

2371
02:07:45,640 --> 02:07:50,113
"Who cares for religion
in this short life?"

2372
02:07:50,537 --> 02:07:53,012
"What is destined will happen."

2373
02:07:53,092 --> 02:07:55,504
"Changes are bound to happen."

2374
02:07:55,584 --> 02:07:59,718
"Que sera sera sera."

2375
02:08:00,645 --> 02:08:04,762
"Today's kingdom
won't exist tomorrow."

2376
02:08:05,577 --> 02:08:09,890
"The one who's a pauper
will get the princess in future."

2377
02:08:10,581 --> 02:08:14,840
"The one who's sick
today will be fit tomorrow."

2378
02:08:15,155 --> 02:08:19,825
"This silly bioscope may be a hit."

2379
02:08:20,574 --> 02:08:23,031
"What is destined will happen."

2380
02:08:23,111 --> 02:08:25,469
"Changes are bound to happen."

2381
02:08:25,594 --> 02:08:29,592
"Que sera sera sera."

2382
02:08:50,281 --> 02:08:52,595
"We'll have to change."

2383
02:08:52,783 --> 02:08:55,107
"What'll stay and what will not."

2384
02:08:55,221 --> 02:08:59,308
"Such calculations won't help."

2385
02:09:00,193 --> 02:09:02,584
"Time is passing."

2386
02:09:02,664 --> 02:09:05,219
"The heart is decaying."

2387
02:09:05,445 --> 02:09:09,915
"The world is changing."

2388
02:09:10,215 --> 02:09:15,231
"Let's change ourselves
in the mean time."

2389
02:09:15,458 --> 02:09:19,704
"Que sera sera sera."

2390
02:09:20,562 --> 02:09:24,731
"It'll be dawn every
morning and night at dusk."

2391
02:09:25,586 --> 02:09:29,634
"But the time in between
will change lot of fates."

2392
02:09:30,536 --> 02:09:34,942
"The people who're here
today won't be here tomorrow."

2393
02:09:35,466 --> 02:09:39,790
"Surname and address will change."

2394
02:09:40,441 --> 02:09:43,011
"What is destined will happen."

2395
02:09:43,091 --> 02:09:45,522
"Changes are bound to happen."

2396
02:09:45,602 --> 02:09:49,573
"Que sera sera sera."

2397
02:09:50,393 --> 02:09:53,949
"Que sera sera sera."

2398
02:09:55,566 --> 02:09:59,728
"Que sera sera sera."
