00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,073
KAAVALAN
[The Bodyguard]

2
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,663
My life changed only in a rail journey

3
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:27,338
Bven if l have got in the middle..

4
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,938
..this story begins in Mettu patti

5
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:35,473
The army major Partha Sarathy's
wife Kanthimathi..

6
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,413
..is pregnant for 10th month

7
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:41,211
Mettupatti's neighborhood
is our village called Semmanoor

8
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:44,480
Muthu Ramalingam
dominates the village!

9
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,559
l am Mari speaking!
l am your man.

10
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,560
He has come to know it..
He would kill me

11
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:55,560
-Save me.
-Where are you talking from?

12
00:03:55,668 --> 00:03:57,295
..from Mettupatti, Murugan koil street.

13
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:01,769
Sir! Don't kill me

14
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,570
l can forgive my enemy
if he can be trusted.

15
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:08,244
l can never forgive a betrayer
even if he is my brother.

16
00:04:08,615 --> 00:04:09,639
Sir..

17
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,655
Muthu Ramalingam came
to the village to take a life!

18
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,248
But it is not a coincidence
that 2 souls were saved because of him

19
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,260
That was god's calculation

20
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:25,056
The infant will inherit the behavior
of the one who names the infant.

21
00:04:25,164 --> 00:04:28,133
So l expect him not to be brutal
& vicious like me.

22
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:30,327
He should be a serene and calm soul!

23
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:32,333
..like the earth which bears everything.

24
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:33,803
l will name him that.

25
00:04:33,906 --> 00:04:34,998
Bhoominathan.

26
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:40,809
Ammukutty & Bhoomi Nathan!

27
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,342
Ammukutty & Bhoomi Nathan!

28
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,011
Why do you erase it off?

29
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:51,147
Because a girl's name is written
along with mine.

30
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,691
She might have liked you.
That's why.

31
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,556
So, is it your work?
Are you the Ammukutty?

32
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,965
Which class are you studying?

33
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,429
He is like this since the childhood.

34
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:07,640
The girls admire him keeping a distance.

35
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,972
All want to become a doctor,
engineer, or a lawyer. What did you say?

36
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,638
-Do you want to become like
Semmanoor Muthu Ramalingam? -Yes sir

37
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:18,046
He named the child so that
he should be serene looking!

38
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,715
..but Bhoominathan

39
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,266
Bhoomi! How's the reception?

40
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:37,398
-For whom?
-lt's for you!

41
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,537
Not bad. There is a guy in my name!

42
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,081
lt is not somebody. lt is only you

43
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:53,675
Go and get him.
Send him in

44
00:05:56,723 --> 00:05:58,748
-You!
-Go l say

45
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,288
How did he fall?

46
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,224
-15 lakhs are ours!
-l didn't do anything.

47
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,631
ls he get any supernatural power?

48
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,846
lt seems there is a sprain in the back

49
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,052
lt is me

50
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,179
There is another man.

51
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:49,271
What happened?

52
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,468
l thought it is a game only.
But he is really hitting me!

53
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,341
You too go.
Don't waste any time.

54
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:37,109
Look! 15 percent is mine as commission!
The rest is yours.

55
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,774
Use it for your sister's marriage!

56
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,187
Don't call me for such things any more!

57
00:08:51,097 --> 00:08:51,927
Mom!

58
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,598
Mother..

59
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,666
Have you come?

60
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:58,668
Where were you all this time?

61
00:08:58,771 --> 00:08:59,931
l told you before l went..

62
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,064
..that l am going to my friend
Shiva's sister's marriage!

63
00:09:02,308 --> 00:09:06,142
Marriage is in Kumbakonam!
Why did you go to Bangkok before that?

64
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,806
Your son were being a rogue locally!

65
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,214
Now he has started to go abroad!
l am..

66
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,615
-Uncle!
-Why are you bothering me?

67
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:15,949
-ls it true what he says?
-Yes mom!

68
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,552
Well done

69
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:19,955
He was in the competition to earn money.

70
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:23,152
He would become a killer just for money.

71
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:24,694
lt is my fate.

72
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:28,560
l thought when he named the child..

73
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,828
l was sure he would inherit
the qualities of Muthu Ramalingam.

74
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,701
He has stopped the criminal activities.

75
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:35,899
..and has become
the Godman of his village.

76
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,771
He has to make this guy good.

77
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,310
That's what l was thinking about.

78
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:42,575
No criminal activities from him,
are allowed in future here.

79
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,109
l couldn't find this address yet..

80
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,186
..when l am searching with this dog.

81
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:52,724
lf l go like this,
l'll be exhausted like this dog.

82
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,723
l think that it is the one.

83
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:58,593
-This is Bhoomi..
-Call him Bhoomi sir.

84
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,461
lf anyone calls him
only his name hereatter..

85
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:01,590
..he will face the consequences.

86
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,269
This is not a house but a temple.

87
00:10:07,506 --> 00:10:09,531
He is not Bhoomi but my Samy(God).

88
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:13,271
Bhoomi! Come out.

89
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,750
Who is it dad?
ls he your friend?

90
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,921
l am your Assistant!

91
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:27,753
Keep me as your assistant!
Your life will be bright.

92
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:29,958
-Who are you?
-Oh god!

93
00:10:30,062 --> 00:10:31,962
You are watching while l am bowing down.

94
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,965
You too have to bow down.
Only then we both can be with him!

95
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:37,499
-Boss! How is my dog's pose?
-Get up!

96
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,695
l won't.
You have to commit me

97
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,705
-Commit
-Who is that?

98
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:43,972
He has come and blocked
the way in the early morning!

99
00:10:44,076 --> 00:10:45,907
-Am l like that?
-Hey, get up man

100
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:47,910
Did l ask you for an assistant?

101
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:49,371
Does one tonsure his head
for Lord Murugan?

102
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,449
Does one wear dress seeing the body?

103
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,574
Like wise l have joined as a bodyguard
for you without your permission

104
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,846
Tell me now. You show me him now

105
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,581
l will chop him off then and there.

106
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,179
He is asking you.
Tell him.

107
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:00,053
-Take courage!
-Let him chop me away.

108
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,057
ls it him?

109
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,652
He is adding more problems! Go

110
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,994
Can l leave the bag and dog here?

111
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,797
He looks like a street dog!

112
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:12,928
Look! You can abuse me,
but not my brother

113
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,870
He is not a street dog as you say.

114
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:18,335
You can watch it.
l will prove that he is a lion!

115
00:11:18,444 --> 00:11:20,002
This is a ball.
Brother.

116
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:26,816
That's it. Fine!

117
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,420
Have you seen it boss?

118
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,682
He has brought back the ball!

119
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,815
l gave him training
for 3 years for this act.

120
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:35,355
3 years for retrieving the ball?

121
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,622
You could bring it in 1 minute as well!

122
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:44,097
-Boss! What is this?
-A sword!

123
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,898
When l was working with Koduva Kummattha..

124
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:48,496
..he gave me this gitt
for my good performance!

125
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,167
lt is the gitt Pitchuva Pakiri gave me!

126
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:55,039
This is the gitt which Bomb Basker
gave me atter he got afraid of me!

127
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,445
-Gitt?
-Bomb!

128
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,384
lf you pull this ring and throw it..

129
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,044
..a group will reduce to ruins!

130
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:04,054
ls it the one?

131
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,522
Damn it. lt will get blasted.

132
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,593
-Throw it if it would blast!
-Yes..

133
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,126
Oh god!

134
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,862
-Whoa! My brother took it.
-Oh god!

135
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,335
He is coming to return to me!

136
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,065
Boss! Please save me.

137
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,073
He has changed the route.

138
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:27,134
lt is not a bun but a bomb!
Throw it down.

139
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,695
Ghost..
Devil..

140
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:46,294
Dog..

141
00:12:49,001 --> 00:12:52,164
Come brother! Where are you?

142
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,238
l am here.

143
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:54,372
Brother has come

144
00:12:54,473 --> 00:12:56,100
What in law..
with a cover in your hand?

145
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,232
ls it the transfer to Semmanoor?

146
00:12:57,343 --> 00:12:59,174
No. Protection duty!

147
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,769
Semmanoor Muthu Ramalingam's
life is in danger!

148
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,248
So for his protection
they have transferred me to there.

149
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:08,843
ls Muthanna's life in danger?
What happened?

150
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:12,586
ln-law! lf you call
Muthu Ramalingam and tell him..

151
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:15,182
..he would refuse to
take police protection.

152
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,659
Our burden will be eased off.

153
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,526
Uncle! Are you a true policeman?

154
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:22,700
When you are given the escort duty
you tend to escape from that.

155
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,629
Give me the order!
l'll go to protect him.

156
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:27,501
This is not any disputes to solve.
This is the department matter.

157
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,507
This is the government order
to protect a life.

158
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:33,442
Bven if l go, it will be
a respect for the order.

159
00:13:33,546 --> 00:13:36,106
Why do you need all these?
You mind your business.

160
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,645
Dad! He is the reason
why my mom and me are alive now.

161
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:44,184
l can't keep idle when l know
that his life is in danger.

162
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:48,188
Why did you give
the letter to him?

163
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,989
What if he reads it
atter getting the doubt?

164
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,528
He won't doubt anyone whom he believes!

165
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:53,996
..or betray them!

166
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,063
That's the quality of my nephew!

167
00:13:56,168 --> 00:14:00,605
SBMMANOOR Municipality.
Welcomes you!

168
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:04,273
Come up! Climb up!

169
00:14:12,117 --> 00:14:13,744
Take it.
Give the change later

170
00:14:19,058 --> 00:14:20,025
Where are you going?

171
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:23,818
l'm going to Semmanoor
Muthuramalingm's house on protection duty.

172
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:25,824
You come and sit here.
l'll get up.

173
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,295
No. You can sit there.

174
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:30,635
l'll get down now

-Tell you to come to me.
-This won't work out.

00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,669
-Damn it! Get up
-What happened?

186
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,000
Listen to me..

187
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,872
Look..

00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,672
Why has he come here
and getting beaten up?

189
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,145
Do you know who you are beating?

190
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,547
You have beaten
the police officer who is..

191

-Why does he need protection?
-His life is in danger!

00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:31,888
He is going as his bodyguard.

196
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,294
l am going with him as an escort.

197
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,094
You are beating him without knowing it.

198
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,827
You ask him to pardon you.

199
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,234
Or else, l'll shoot down all in the bus!

200
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,242
Sir! l issued the ticket
without knowing who you are.

-Valli sister. Where is Meera?
-She is upstairs.

207
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:18,006
Where are you?

208
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,677
A bodyguard has come to your house.

209
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,348
Bodyguard? Why?

210
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,415
Your dad's life is in danger.

211
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,612
The bodyguard has come
for his protection!

212
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:31,349
Who has told this foolishness?

213
00:16:31,457 --> 00:16:33,687
Foolishness?
My dad has told me that.

214
00:16:33,792 --> 00:16:35,225
He sleeps when he walks!

215
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,624
He would have blabbered
this in his dream!

216
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:41,629
This is the Semmanoor place.
Please come.

217
00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,904
This is where Muthu Ramalingam
was born and brought up.

218
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,235
He is not here now.
He is in Dubai.

219
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,571
He will come in the evening flight.
He will be here atter that.

220
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,309
-Sir!
-Please come.

221
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:05,255
-Please come. She is his wife!
Devika madam. -Greetings!

223
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,658
Bhoomi Nathan, sir!

00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,391
Chakrapani, l'm the only manager to sir!

225
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:16,593
l am very alert that even
a shadow wouldn't enter here.

226
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,671
When there are no enemies
for him in this place..

227
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,400
..l wonder why he needs a protection!

228
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,874
-Chakra brother!
-l was asking that to him.

229
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,672
Does he have any enemies here?

230
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:28,739
Danger can come not only from the enemies!

231
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:31,145
But it can be from the people around.

232
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,084
This is the main hall of this house!

233
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,889
-ls he the bodyguard?
-Yes!

234
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:44,156
-What?
-She is sir's daughter Meera!

235
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:50,833
Meera! He took me for you!

236
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:51,833
Let it be like that.

237
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:55,100
-Sir! -Come.
Let's go around the house.

238
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:56,898
He is coming

239
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:02,036
-This is the court yard.
-Look! ls he like the bodyguard?

240
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:04,581
He wants to go around
our home like the groom

241
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:13,449
Nothing will enter into
this house still l am here

242
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,658
Sir's room is in the upstairs

243
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:18,461
Oh god!

244
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,661
Who is it?

245
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,673
Who has cracked he balloon? Who?

246
00:18:32,311 --> 00:18:34,279
-Why do you stare at me?
-lt is not me.

247
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,812
lt's you atter your sleep.

248
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:48,753
An arrow!

249
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,021
Where has it come from now?

250
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,555
ls it from my head?

251
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:54,831
As a bodyguard, you should've
come with energy (Thembu).

252
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,161
..not with an arrow (ambu)

253
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,437
He looks very smart!

254
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,699
He is coming!
Bscape. Go.

255
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,302
Oops! Go..

256
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:10,173
-l'll meet sir in the airport
-Ok. You may go.

257
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,526
-Who are you? -She..!
-She works in Meera's factory!

258
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,064
Why is she here instead of the factory?

259
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,191
We have come to see you.

260
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:34,329
-Why? -We haven't seen
a bodyguard as a whole.

261
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,138
Are you teasing?
Do l look like a buffoon?

262
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:40,741
None is allowed to come
unnecessarily to this compound.

263
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,408
We will come at times!
Who are you to tell that?

264
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,881
Who is this smarty?
ls it the union leader?

265
00:19:45,984 --> 00:19:48,748
You can have this nonsense
in your factory. Not here.

266
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,624
Whoa! My head has exploded!

267
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,558
They have shot me!
Shot me! Shot me to death.

268
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,895
MADURAl AlRPORT

269
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,566
Whao! lt's my man.

270
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,503
Where has he gone?

271
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,430
He was here.

272
00:20:14,813 --> 00:20:16,781
-What is going on?
-What boss? What have you done?

273
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,907
Muthu Ramalingam and
his son are coming in the flight.

274
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,382
We have to provide security
for them, right?

275
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,385
lt is ok. lt is not raining now.

276
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:25,047
-Why do you wear a rain coat?
-Rain coat?

277
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,454
This is an unique outfit.

278
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,992
A dress with good sense!

279
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:30,721
Yes boss! Magnetic dress!

280
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,328
-Magnetic dress?
-Yes boss

281
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,060
The magnetic dress

282
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:41,332
This dress will find out the iron
weapons if any in this airport!

283
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,998
lt can reveal them to us!

284
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,545
Oh my God!

285
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:54,419
A rifle is on my body

286
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,820
Pull it out.

287
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,948
Snatch it away.

288
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,889
What a police you are!
Snatch it away

289
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,295
Damn it. You are shooting
instead of snatch it.

290
00:21:05,397 --> 00:21:07,365
Oh god! Don't shoot

291
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,293
Place it in upward direction

292
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,897
Oops!

293
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,404
Thank god!

294
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:33,387
Tell me boss.

295
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,856
Muthu Ramalingam is coming out.
Finish him.

296
00:21:37,095 --> 00:21:38,062
OK sir.

297
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,162
Dad! What happened?

298
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,966
Someone came running and hit against me.

299
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:21,969
Let's go.

300
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,589
Where is he?
..not to be seen!

301
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,325
Can't you see?
He is there.

302
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,794
l didn't ask for Karthi!

303
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,530
-l was asking for the bodyguard.
-Who? -lt is him

304
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:56,004
He has come to receive you in the
airport. Didn't you see him?

305
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,665
Wash your face!
You are always sleeping!

306
00:22:58,777 --> 00:23:00,938
l don't say in the sleep.

307
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,071
Really your bodyguard has come.

308
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,614
-Bodyguard?
-Yes

309
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,683
Why do l need a bodyguard?

310
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,081
Dad! Your life is in danger!

311
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:08,277
He was ordered to come.

312
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:12,820
Yes! That's why he has been
allotted space in the out house.

313
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,220
Don't you have sense?

314
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:17,226
You believe strangers what they say!

315
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:18,819
..and provide what they ask for, right?

316
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,899
Sir! l am here. Tell me.

317
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,898
l don't need a bodyguard.

318
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,369
-Send them back whoever it is.
OK? -Right sir.

319
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,706
Dad is like that.
Don't send them back.

320
00:23:36,948 --> 00:23:39,439
We need a guy like that for our safety.

321
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:42,445
l'll talk to dad, ok?

322
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,719
Dad wants him to go back
and daughter is against him!

323
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,860
How can l have my sleep in this situation?

324
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,463
You union leader!
What are you doing here?

325
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,061
You have to go back to your home
atter the work!

326
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,141
l went.
Madam asked me to come!

327
00:24:05,377 --> 00:24:06,867
That's why l came here.

328
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,741
You go to that room
if mom asked to come..

329
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:10,405
Why do you go to his room?

330
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,213
-That is..
-Are you acting big?

331
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:16,282
He went out of town
in the ladies weakness!

332
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:17,355
..and he has come only now!

333
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,014
Do you want to create problem again?

334
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,490
What did you say?
Ladies weakness?

335
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,083
Yes, ln college..

336
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:26,761
Come here.

337
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,292
When he was in the college,
he got linked up with a girl..

338
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,493
..and created a big problem!

339
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,765
Her dad took him and was about
to forcibly marry him to his daughter!

340
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,636
Our sir managed to save him from that
and sent him to Dubai!

341
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:38,967
How do the bodyguard know all this?

342
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:42,112
Do you think that a bodyguard is nothing?

343
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,248
l know the complete history
of the bodyguard..

344
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,442
.. and how the enemies could come!

345
00:24:46,551 --> 00:24:48,382
l could get rid of them
by force only then!

346
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,588
What if he too is strong?

347
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:55,859
Then.. we have to use

348
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,588
Why do you ask cross questions?

349
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:02,128
Only animals use their power
to rule over other animals!

350
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:08,471
-What? -We have to use
love not strength to correct man!

Stop

369
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:31,322

00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,649
-You can go, l'll take care of him.

371
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,727
He is my brother!

Just now l met Meera there..

379
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,620
lf he sees you..
he won't let you go alive! Go..

380
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:17,693
Whoa! What happened?

381

He ran and she chased him for fun

00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,592
He fell down by accident in the steps..

390
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,467
lf you run in the dark
you would fall by accident.

391
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,272
Are they children to fall down for that?

392

in love with him.

501
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,475
lt was your arrogance
which caused your girl's death.

502
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:05,137
By blaming my son,
you wanted to ruin my family.

00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,613
lt is not because l am afraid that
l am being polite to you.

Success will come to me non-stop.

You can be proud
to be the reason for it.

Boss! You can't chase
me anymore.

00:38:54,365 --> 00:38:56,731
You send me away whenever
l ask you for a job.

and introduced him!

521
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,151
He offered him the driver's job.

522
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:20,289
-lt is gone.
-Gone? What did you lose?

523
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,222
You! Close the shop!

524
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,090
Bodyguard! Sir is calling you.

525
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:31,824
-Sir! Did you call me?
-Yes.

526
00:39:32,336 --> 00:39:35,362
Give your details & certificates
of your college to Karthi!

527
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,103
l have arranged for admission for you
in the college where Meera is studying!

528
00:39:38,609 --> 00:39:41,510
Do you want to admit
me in the college? No sir.

529
00:39:41,746 --> 00:39:44,112
lt is long time since
l stopped my studies.

530
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,771
l don't want to study anymore!

531
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,440
Who is bothered about your studies?

532
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,448
You will be the bodyguard for Meera.

533
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:51,455
..as Meera's bodyguard?

534
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,785
Yes! Meera and my daughter
Madhu are going to college...

535
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,256
..atter the vacation!

536
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,190
Sir has decided that you have to go
with them as their bodyguard!

537
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:06,369
Sir! Don't mistake me. lt is my duty
to be your bodyguard.

538
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,698
But for a girl.....!

539
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:13,236
Bhoomi! Didn't you hear
what Devarajan told the other day?

540
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:17,179
Ok,sir. l will go.

541
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,710
Chakra! Don't sleep.
Make arrangements for them to go.

542
00:40:23,821 --> 00:40:28,258
Ok, Sir. Tomorrow you are
going with them.

543
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:31,453
Along with them
your future husband...

544
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,999
Look how he gives his pose.
What is his name?

545
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,864
-Amavasai! -Amavasai and you
are going with them.

546
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:41,737
-Why do we want him?
-Just to accompany you.

547
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,397
You are not going
to the college hostel.

548
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:45,600
But in the guest house of sir.

549
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:54,881
Wait. Meera's is engaged already.

550
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,150
Keep that in mind always.

551
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,713
-Then Chakra brother!
-Correct!

552
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,015
He shouldn't behave like
a student in the college.

553
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:06,025
-He should be a bodyguard!
-Don't worry madam.

554
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:09,562
l'll be a shadow for Meera
wherever she go.

555
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,430
..like a perfect bodyguard.

556
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:24,203
Students who have come
for the 1st day of the college..

557
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:28,544
This university's courageous guy
lion of the college.

558
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:31,143
l welcome the leader on behalf of all!

559
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,759
-Hai, buddy.
-Get away.

560
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:44,363
ls it a garland?
l thought it was an Arch.

561
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:47,769
Oops!

562
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:51,305
You give me a heavy one.

563
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,373
Don't you have sense?

564
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,506
A rose flower is apt for me.

565
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,773
Take it fast. Someone will
against it and die. Take it.

566
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:04,784
lt seems like a hill.

567
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:17,266
-Who is that? -Wait!
Get down only atter l tell you.

568
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:37,578
Oh God!

569
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,586
His outfit looks silly.

570
00:42:44,828 --> 00:42:47,388
All are looking at us.

571
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:51,067
Let them watch us.
Let them know that l'm your bodyguard.

572
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,459
This uniform is for that only.

573
00:42:55,706 --> 00:42:57,674
Have you gone with them
in the bodyguard's attire?

574
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:00,266
Do you remember
what l told you?

575
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,741
Where are you now?
Have you reached the college?

576
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,473
Yes madam! Meera and Madhu
are going to their classes!

577
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,018
l'm going behind them!

578
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,363
ls your duty in the ladies toilet?

579
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,965
Sir! That is...

580
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:27,630
You went there wantonly.

581
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:30,163
You were a rowdy
in the college you studied.

582
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,172
Many people told me that.

583
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:33,308
But you were given
admission in this college.

584
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,503
Do you know why?
Atter seeing your mark sheet only.

585
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,512
You could be No.1 in the university..

586
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,585
..if you hadn't been a rowdy
in the college and if you studied well.

587
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:47,247
You have chances to become
a rank holder even now.

588
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:49,918
He is doing unnecessary talk

589
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,519
You have been pardoned off
for this only reason..

590
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,996
..without dismissing you! Understand?

591
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,730
lf you go to the ladies toilet again
in the pretext of your duty...

592
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,133
l won't go unless you tell me.

593
00:44:00,237 --> 00:44:01,932
-Ok go.
-To the ladies toilet?

594
00:44:02,106 --> 00:44:03,801
Go to your class.

595
00:44:05,242 --> 00:44:09,941
He is bothering me too much. See him!

596
00:44:11,782 --> 00:44:12,942
Sit down on the floor.

597
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,018
lf the desk breaks off..
they will blame me.

598
00:44:41,412 --> 00:44:42,845
What is this? Go and sit there.

599
00:44:47,584 --> 00:44:49,211
The one with a smiling mouth has come.

600
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,687
Go and sit.

601
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:01,896
l told you to sit.

602
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,434
Why? ls there any problem?

603
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:13,873
Bodyguards won't sit.

604
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:24,679
Bodyguard! What for?

605
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,554
What's your name sir?

606
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:43,573
Whoa!

607
00:45:46,343 --> 00:45:47,435
Careful..

608
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,043
Move a little.

609
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:13,261
That is.. You should
concentrate in the class!

610
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:15,065
lf you look here and there,
you won't be able to understand.

611
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,796
Are you coming to the college to study
or for the fashion parade?

612
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:36,091
l didn't ask you!
Are you Meera?

613
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:38,490
Whoever it is,
all you want is the answer!

614
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,180
He is there for giving
protection for Meera.

615
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:03,344
Who will give protection for me?

616
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,847
That's why l told you to be
friendly with Bhoomi!

617
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:07,181
Not at all.

618
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:10,520
lf he has to be brought
in our way as you think..

619
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:14,256
..it could be possible
only with you girls.

620
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:21,001
-Just have a try.
-Don't you like us being alive?

621
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,731
l didn't ask you to go to him and tell.

622
00:47:22,973 --> 00:47:23,803
l mean over the phone!

623
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,141
Do you know how many
girls love me over the phone?

624
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:30,210
None of them know who l am.

625
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:32,745
That's the advantage of the love in phone!

626
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,410
Be quiet. None has to change
him over the phone.

627
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,215
Tell an idea how to change
his uniform.That's enough.

628
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,887
l feel jealousy when l see your uniform.

629
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,585
You haven't given me
a chance to wear this.

630
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,992
-Give me the chance
to press it at least. -No.

631
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,732
You go and have bath and have food.

632
00:47:50,834 --> 00:47:51,926
l will do the ironing work.

633
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,796
-Go and mind your work.
-l am asking the work only.

634
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:54,734
Go and sleep.

635
00:47:55,372 --> 00:48:00,207
You are not lucky enough.
See what he is doing!

636
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,870
He seems to have worked
in the tiffin shop before.

637
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:05,346
Ouch! Mom!

638
00:48:05,515 --> 00:48:07,813
He has enough monkey acts it looks!

639
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,075
l should be alert while go for sleeping!

640
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:26,269
What is that strange smell?

641
00:48:26,503 --> 00:48:27,731
Has anything happened to him?

642
00:48:38,982 --> 00:48:42,884
Oops! Who might have done it?

643
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,751
God! Show me the one
who has done it.

644
00:48:58,535 --> 00:48:59,627
What happened?
Who is yelling?

645
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,035
l will bring an end to your nuisance!

646
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,040
Why did you do that?

647
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:11,713
Save me! He is killing me. Save me.

648
00:49:12,082 --> 00:49:15,108
Leave him. l tell you to stop it.

649
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:17,310
ls it the time to quarrel?

650
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:18,513
l didn't quarrel with him.

651
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,453
He pressed me with the hot iron!

652
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,852
Look where he has done it!

653
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,193
Look madam! All see it.

654
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:26,119
He has pressed it in the wrong place.

655
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,325
Nasty. How dare you show the place?

656
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:33,733
l showed my trouser
where you have pressed.

657
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,201
l didn't do anything!
l was sleeping!

658
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:39,001
lt was him who has pressed the iron on me.

659
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:40,337
-Didn't you do anything?
-Yes!

660
00:49:40,444 --> 00:49:42,810
-l told you not to
do anything! -Yes!

661
00:49:43,714 --> 00:49:45,341
-Why did you do this then?
-What did l do then?

662
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:47,474
Look, what has he done.

663
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:52,177
He could've stolen it instead!

664
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:54,324
He made holes in it and made it useless.

665
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:55,716
Yes! ldiot!

666
00:49:55,892 --> 00:49:57,257
Who is the idiot
who has put holes in it?

667
00:49:57,361 --> 00:49:58,521
l want to know it now.

668
00:49:58,628 --> 00:49:59,925
-lt's you.
-Me?

669
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,994
How could l do that
when l was sleeping?

670
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:02,997
Somnambulism!

671
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:10,998
Take me to a lone place and scold me

672
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,268
l will accept that.

673
00:50:12,442 --> 00:50:17,539
lf you disgrace me before the girls
our friendship will get cut.

674
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:20,775
Somnambulism is a disease which the
patient walks in sleep.

675
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:22,383
-Me?
-Bnough!

676
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:23,510
-Me?
-Bnough, sir!

677
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,245
lt is atter all pants!
Why all this chaos?

678
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:26,980
What will l wear
in the college tomorrow?

679
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,115
Don't you have any pants
and shirts with you?

680
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,523
This is my uniform!

681
00:50:30,894 --> 00:50:32,657
Are you an LKG student
to wear the uniform?

682
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:35,391
That's it. What's the use
studying big LKG studies?

683
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,591
Has God created us to rub
the iron in one's back?

684
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:43,868
-Leave it
-Switch off the light and sleep.

685
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:54,207
From today on wards, the uniform matter..

686
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:02,282
-What are you searching?
-Where is the other iron box?

687
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,484
Another iron box!

688
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:08,363
Look! There are two holes!
But the iron box is only one.

689
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:09,329
Where is the other one?

690
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:12,233
Look under the bed.

691
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,302
What is it? Whoe!

692
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:21,773
Wait.

693
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:24,779
A fire burn can be cured
but not the verbal abuse

694
00:51:24,881 --> 00:51:26,974
Poet Kannadasan has told it once!

695
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:30,053
ls it Kannadasan or Yesudas (singer)?

696
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:35,116
Poor guy! He has got confused.

697
00:51:38,028 --> 00:51:40,724
Bither he or she won't
allow me to sleep.

698
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:42,454
Let the marriage be over.

699
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:47,533
Meera! Madhu! Open the door.

700
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:49,928
What happened to you?
Why do you yell up?

701
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:55,576
-Come fast. -What happened to her?
-Look there.

702
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,573
Hasn't the size taken
correct in sleepy mood?

703
00:51:59,483 --> 00:52:00,973
lt is little over size!

704
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,578
The tailor has told the same.

705
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,448
Whether you are my boss or a lunatic!

706
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,183
Where did you get the uniform?

707
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:14,263
lt was been tailored, the whole day!

708
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,127
Bnough! Haven't you got ready yet?

709
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,594
-Come fast.
-Poongodi, come here.

710
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:21,737
Didn't you hear the boss?

711
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,203
Go and bring salt.
We can clean the teeth.

712
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,672
Don't talk if you couldn't understand.

713
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:27,208
-What?
-lt is hurry up what he said.

714
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:30,404
-What is meant by hurry up?
-lt is to come fast.

715
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:34,476
Stop there. Will you go atter
him if he calls you?

716
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:39,214
l am telling now.
Go this way and hurry up. Go.

717
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,351
Muthu Ramalingam's daughter
is coming to college!

718
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:47,896
She has a bodyguard with her always!

719
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:52,263
Look there. Meera! A blind guy
is coming atter you.

720
00:52:52,435 --> 00:52:54,801
Hold his hand.. or else
he will hit against something.

721
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,132
Can you take away your glasses?

722
00:52:57,307 --> 00:52:59,673
Then everyone will know
that l am watching!

723
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,473
l'll show him how can we
escape from him

724
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:14,616
Meera! How long should
we wait for you?

725
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,553
We can talk later.
Give that to her.

726
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,825
Here it is.

727
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:24,295
-Allah will bless you!
-May God bless you!

728
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,628
lt is not that.
Same to you.

729
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,167
She has gone!

730
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,236
-Where is Meera?
-She is inside.

731
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:33,206
She will come now.

732
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,232
Where would she have gone?

733
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:06,672
When did you come sir?

734
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,146
Keep it all with you.
l'll get it later.

735
00:54:11,381 --> 00:54:12,405
l give importance to my work.

736
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:19,478
He goes to the ladies toilet always.

737
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,214
What is there in it?

738
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,416
Oops!

739
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:26,495
-Why are you still here?
Go away -Sorry!

740
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,425
Thank God! Nobody has seen me!

741
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,383
Why did you stop it?

742
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:52,913
Are you dancing?

743
00:55:02,899 --> 00:55:06,926
Rogue! ls it something
a master does?

744
00:55:07,237 --> 00:55:09,137
You are not supposed to come
this campus any more.

745
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,673
Get away. Go.

746
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:16,411
-What are you doing?
-Don't talk.

747
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,615
Don't you know his intention
when he touched you?

748
00:55:19,716 --> 00:55:21,206
You should have whacked him!

749
00:55:21,518 --> 00:55:22,883
lt was right when you
beat him for what he did.

750
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,279
Why did you send him away?

751
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,952
What can l do now?

752
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:55,176
Youth is calling..

753
00:55:55,418 --> 00:55:57,477
The heart is flying..

754
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,586
Lightning in you wakes up.

755
00:56:04,728 --> 00:56:06,923
Till the top, keep it up.

756
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,430
Look at it.. the world is
full of beauty.

757
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:17,966
The love in you will set off the firel

758
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,944
Dance forgetting you
and you'll feel serene.

759

Youth is calling..

760
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:53,501
The heart is flying..

761
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:14,888
Wear the shirt and trousers loose.

762
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:18,694
Don't mingle with bad ftiends.

763
00:57:19,702 --> 00:57:24,002
Get the love ftom the girlsl

764
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:28,176

New loverl Let us enjoy.

770
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,164
Looks like a small boy.

771
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,430
But you are a very smart guy.

772
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,700
Girls like me eye you.

773
00:58:34,277 --> 00:58:38,805
l'm not a fool.
l'm not the one like you.

774
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:43,179
Watch my dance...
nobody can challenge me.

775
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:51,920
Legs would move to your
dance movements. Dance with me.

776
00:58:52,428 --> 00:58:56,797
Let's dance joining our hands,
embrace each other..

777
00:58:57,033 --> 00:59:01,265

778
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:25,119
Youth is calling.

779
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:27,558
The heart is flying..

780
00:59:32,101 --> 00:59:32,931
Get her.

781
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,101
Madhu! You go home with them

782
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,208
Don't do anything to me.

783
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:58,074
Devaraj is the reason for everything.

784
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:09,787
-Where is Devaraj?
-Don't do anything to us.

785
01:02:10,026 --> 01:02:11,926
To tell the truth,
he has gone to US.

786
01:02:12,095 --> 01:02:14,723
-Has he gone to US?
-That nobody should suspect him..

787
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,125
He did all arrangements and has escaped.

788
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:18,592
He wouldn't come back.

789
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:22,931
He will be alive till he is there.

790
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:23,937
Tell him.

791
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:38,316
-Dad! -Nothing has happened
to you, right?

792
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,217
No mom.
You need not worry, mom.

793
01:02:41,457 --> 01:02:42,754
Bhoomi was there with us.

794
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:56,903
We sent our girl
to you believing you!

795
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,508
lt is like your parents has sent
you to me believing you.

796
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,242
You should not go for any violence.

797
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:05,177
But l myself have sent you for that.

798
01:03:05,815 --> 01:03:08,045
You can call me up whatever it is.

799
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:09,516
-l'll take care of it.
-Ok

800
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:10,652
You should not go
for any violence.

801
01:03:11,521 --> 01:03:13,045
You've to concentrate
on your studies.

802
01:03:13,222 --> 01:03:16,191
Not only you. You have to
teach these girls too well.

803
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,719
-lt is your duty hereatter.
-Ok!

804
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:41,681
l feel sleepy.

805
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:43,351
l'll write the rest tomorrow.

806
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,685
God! You all can go and sleep.

807
01:03:51,594 --> 01:03:53,755
You both have to be here
tomorrow morning at 4.

808
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:58,027
Good! Sit down!
Let's have it atter our marriage.

809
01:03:58,134 --> 01:04:00,830
-What happened?
-We will finish writing now itself.

810
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:01,767
Tell us.

811
01:04:02,538 --> 01:04:03,436
Didn't you hear me?

812
01:04:03,539 --> 01:04:05,507
You fell drowsy when
taking down the notes.

813
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,439
Why do you look there?
Go and sleep.

814
01:04:07,543 --> 01:04:08,976
We shall continue in the morning. Go.

815
01:04:09,078 --> 01:04:10,773
They have finished it at last.
Let us go and sleep.

816
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:14,110
-We shall continue in
the morning. -Go.

817
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:15,315
Haven't you slept yet?

818
01:04:15,418 --> 01:04:19,912
You are teaching those
learned girls, ignoring me

819
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,579
All the doors have closed.

820
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,660
Boss! He forgot to put the lock
as he was annoyed.

821
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:26,920
See what my dad has done!

822
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:30,430
When l wanted to avoid the guy
he was made him our master.

823
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,396
He is not a master,
but the head master!

824
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:35,059
He was innocent and caring at first.

825
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:37,799
Now he acts as a military officer!

826
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,999
He could smile at us a bit at least.

827
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:41,877
Hey stop!

828
01:04:42,478 --> 01:04:45,140
Madhu! We should bring Bhoomi in our way.

829
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:46,338
Find a way for that.

830
01:04:46,515 --> 01:04:48,813
Forget this foolish act and try
to get some sleep.

831
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,418
You have to get up at 4 in the morning.

832
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:54,347
None can change him as you think.

833
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:58,356
Bonsai told before all the girls
to try to love Bhoomi in the phone!

834
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,424
Did anyone try it?
Forget love.

835
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:05,489
No girls have the courage
to stand before him.

836
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,032
lf so, what if l tried myself?

837
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:10,905
Why should you try?
Don't spoil your prestige.

838
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,563
He wouldn't know it is me.

839
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,369
How will you talk if he
doesn't know it is you?

840
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:17,973
This mobile restricts the caller lD.

841
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,045
lf you call in this phone,
the phone number will not come.

842
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:21,444
lt will come as the private number.

843
01:05:21,617 --> 01:05:22,845
He can't find me out, right?

844
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:24,483
He could find you from your voice.

845
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:27,121
l'll change my tone when l talk.

846
01:05:27,623 --> 01:05:30,319
Another tone?
How is that?

847
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:39,196
l am your fan!

848
01:05:42,038 --> 01:05:44,336
Can he find out with this tone?

849
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,341
No. Not at all!
How did you do it?

850
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:48,740
That's it!

851
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,013
Meera! Don't play.
lt will pose a problem.

852
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:54,212
Nothing like that.

853
01:05:54,317 --> 01:05:55,409
You shouldn't tell it to anyone.

854
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,289
What is this private number?

855
01:06:09,665 --> 01:06:10,461
Who is it?

856
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:16,727
Can't you hear me talking?

857
01:06:37,259 --> 01:06:41,821
Who is it? l'm asking you.
Won't you talk?

858
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,166
The phone has to be
in the dust bin.

859
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:51,833
-Who?
-Bhoominathan!

860
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:54,307
-Which Bhoominathan?
-The Bodyguard!

861
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,570
l didn't ask you, boss!

862
01:06:55,811 --> 01:06:56,903
l asked you who was
talking to you in the phone.

863
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,844
l too asked that but no reply.

864
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,108
You could as well dial the number and ask!

865
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:02,115
No number has come!

866
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:04,311
The phone comes without
a number. ls it possible?

867
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:05,317
Go to sleep then.

868
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:06,513
You can talk only when the number appears.

869
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08,189
How roguish?

870
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,123
Boss! Stop.

871
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,458
lf the party keeps silent
even atter hearing our voice..

872
01:07:14,563 --> 01:07:15,461
..it will be a shame for us.

873
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:18,055
Now l will talk.
How dare he is?

874
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,605
Boss! lt is a girl!

875
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:28,267
Girl? Which girl?

876
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:29,741
Ask her from which
number is she calling!

877
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:34,473
From which number are you calling?

878
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:36,278
Whom do you want?

879
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,153
l want to talk to Bhoominathan?

880
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:42,289
The phone is his... but the tone is mine.

881
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,894
-Who are you dear?
-Lover!

882
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:52,496
Why should your lover
call me in my number?

883
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:53,625
lt is your lover boss!

884
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:55,564
Only your lover would call in your phone!

885
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:00,039
Who are you?

886
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:01,439
Are you playing with me?

887
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,043
l'll whack you up.
Keep it down.

888
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:05,971
ls it a coconut?
lt is a cellular phone.

889
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,516
Abraham Lincoln would have
toiled much to invent that!

890
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:11,649
Was it Abraham Lincoln or Abdul Kalam?

891
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,255
He himself has got confused.

892
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:16,324
We will ask him in the morning!

893
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:17,652
The idea has been worked out!

894
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:19,192
lt's enough for him

895
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,520
The rest can be tomorrow.

896
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:40,904
Open the door.

897
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:48,284
You both get ready and come downstairs.

898
01:08:51,594 --> 01:08:54,563
-Get up!
-Meera, get ready!

899
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,503
-Fast.
-Damn it.

900
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:16,646
Meera! Get ready fast and come.

901
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:18,913
Or the head master would come up.

902
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:24,150
Attend it. lf you cut it
he would call you again!

903
01:10:24,520 --> 01:10:28,616
This look like a phony number.
No need to attend it.

904
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,493
-See!
-You could switch it off.

905
01:10:38,133 --> 01:10:40,226
Sir has told that the phone
shouldn't be switched off.

906
01:10:40,603 --> 01:10:42,628
-Keep quiet.
-lt has got cut.

907
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:46,507
Why do you tell it again and again?

908
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:05,652
l have do urgent work.
Go fast.

909
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:13,735
You...

910
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,209
Have you disconnected it?

911
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,671
You are safe as you have cut it.

912
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:27,078
lf you are caught l would kill you.

913
01:11:34,923 --> 01:11:35,890
Keep quiet.

914
01:11:37,393 --> 01:11:39,088
l can sleep peacefully now.

915
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:46,296
Meera! Get up and get ready.

916
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:49,426
Why do you wake me up so early?

917
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:51,840
Do you know what the time is?

918
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:56,836
The bodyguard has got
ready with his uniform at 7.

919
01:11:57,613 --> 01:12:00,047
Damn uniform! l'll have to
do something for that.

920
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:10,521
Parvathi Nambiyar!
l've picked up Bnglish.

921
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:13,390
Boss! A Parvathi Nambiyar calls you.

922
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,788
-ls it you?
-Who is that Parvathi Nambiyar?

923
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,191
lt is not Parvathi Nambiyar.
lt is private number!

924
01:12:19,568 --> 01:12:21,559
ls the spelling same for both?

925
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:25,571
lt is her. You have come!
l was expecting you till now.

926
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:26,572
You haven't switched it on.

927
01:12:26,675 --> 01:12:27,972
You could talk only if you switch it on.

928
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,773
-You can go.
-lf you have understood, it is good.

929
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:34,442
Have you called me boss?
lt's the girl.

930
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:36,177
Don't talk in the phone.
Come in person!

931
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:37,785
l will cure your insanity!

932
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,918
lt can't be cured.

933
01:12:40,155 --> 01:12:44,455
-l am crazy atter you!
-What?

934
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:50,931
l like very much the uniform you wear,
cap, glasses, your walk and style!

935
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:57,262
-You are my hero!
-Hero? Whose hero.. what hero?

936
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:00,875
l didn't wear this uniform for you!

937
01:13:01,510 --> 01:13:04,946
When a mad person like you calls me up..

938
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:06,738
..and tells me that you like me..

939
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,817
..do you expect me to come atter you?

940
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:12,214
lf you call me again, you will
lose your phone and get hurt

941
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:13,754
You have to know who l am.

942
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:17,219
Whatever it is.. You'll get hurt
in any case. Keep the phone down.

943
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:24,492
-What happened?
-lt will show he respects my call..

944
01:13:24,733 --> 01:13:26,963
..if he wears the uniform again!

945
01:13:27,136 --> 01:13:31,368
lf he changes his uniform
it'll show he responds to my call

946
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:35,975
-Uncle!
-What is it?

947
01:13:36,078 --> 01:13:37,943
Bodyguard hasn't wore the uniform.

948
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:40,775
Didn't he wear?
How do you know it?

949
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:43,317
-l peeped through the window.
-Did you see!

950
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:44,712
lt was very superb!

951
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:51,257
You saw the nasty scene
and tells that now to the would be.

952
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,385
-l will....
-You foolish uncle!

953
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:56,862
-He is wearing the color dress.
-Colour dress?

954
01:13:56,965 --> 01:13:57,989
Who did he ask to wear it?

955
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:00,064
Why do you look there again?

956
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:10,972
What is this nasty dress?

957
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:14,376
-He looks very superb!
-Stupid! ..stop blabbering.

958
01:14:19,822 --> 01:14:22,188
Bhoomi! Why are you in this new dress?

959
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,223
ls it your birthday?

960
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:25,524
lt will be like this, henceforth.

961
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,390
There should be some
change in life!

962
01:14:27,563 --> 01:14:30,999
-l didn't like this change!
-l too don't like you!

963
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:40,341
How bad was his word?

964
01:14:57,659 --> 01:14:59,627
Our treatment has worked out well.

965
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:01,218
The one who hated the women before..

966
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,093
..is now watching them very well!

967
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:04,363
Don't look! Come.

968
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,231
You are very kind

969
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:07,628
Look at the dress of the bodyguard.

970
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,766
You have changed the uniform
and have come stylish!

971
01:15:13,141 --> 01:15:14,438
Have you gone for your engagement?

972
01:15:14,943 --> 01:15:17,969
Yes! l'm looking out for a girl!

973
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:21,983
lf l get her, l'll see to her.

974
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:26,243
-ls it okay with you?
-lt's okay

975
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,122
lf he knew that we are those
we will be finished.

976
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:30,919
Coward! lt looks like
you will show us to him!

977
01:15:31,026 --> 01:15:31,993
Come quietly.

978
01:15:34,897 --> 01:15:35,989
Why do you laugh?

979
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:47,938
Stop! Tell it again!
Tell it again!

980
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:50,809
Once again sottly.

981
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:56,212
Tell it quietly.
You can go.

982
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:58,887
He is coming.

983
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:19,373
Who are you!
Where are you?

984
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:21,374
l am here only.
Where are you?

985
01:16:22,678 --> 01:16:23,508
Tell hello.

986
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,178
Tell it in the phone.

987
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:30,376
lt is nothing.
lt is here...

988
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,519
l am asking you.
Where are you now?

989
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,657
You have quarreled with a girl.

990
01:16:35,891 --> 01:16:37,256
l crossed you only then!

991
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:43,787
l will find a solution for you today.

992
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,526
You talk... and keep talking.

993
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:48,795
l'll find you in 15 minutes!

994
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,336
Why do you bother much?

995
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:51,995
Tell me that you love me!

996
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,174
l'll be before you the next moment.

997
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:57,210
..with a stylish smile!
-Smile?

998
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:59,744
There won't be a tooth lett in your mouth.

999
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,472
Do you want love?

1000
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,341
Not only 15 minutes.

1001
01:17:03,518 --> 01:17:07,352
You will have to search
for me for your life.

1002
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:12,052
l will not love you
if you call me the entire life.

1003
01:17:12,527 --> 01:17:14,757
The moment l threw it away
when you told me..

1004
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:18,355
..that you like me... know it?

1005
01:17:18,533 --> 01:17:21,502
You look handsome in this dress!

1006
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,103
But you have to tuck in the shirt.

1007
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:25,762
Your hair style is like Gemini Ganesh.

1008
01:17:25,941 --> 01:17:27,966
You have to undo the hair
and redo it with the hand.

1009
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:29,110
That's the latest trend.

1010
01:17:29,211 --> 01:17:33,238
l will tuck my shirt and do the hair.

1011
01:17:33,348 --> 01:17:34,372
You don't have to worry for that.

1012
01:17:34,750 --> 01:17:36,445
Tell your name if you have courage.

1013
01:17:36,551 --> 01:17:37,575
Why do you need the name?

1014
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:40,187
You can call me Ammukutty as well.

1015
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:42,585
-What?
-Ammukutty!

1016
01:17:44,960 --> 01:17:46,393
Ammukutty!

1017
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,795
Hello! Are you Ammukutty?

1018
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:18,085
You look handsome in this dress!

1019
01:18:18,193 --> 01:18:19,751
But you have to tuck in the shirt.

1020
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:24,624
You have to undo the hair
and re do it with the hand.

1021
01:18:25,867 --> 01:18:29,166
lt has started to drizzle in the desert.

1022
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,638
Then, it'll be heavy rain

1023
01:18:51,226 --> 01:18:56,027
Who is it? Who is it?..

1024
01:18:56,131 --> 01:19:01,194
Who is it? Who is it?..

1025
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:05,867
The one who tortures my mind.

1026
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:10,804
The one who closes the eyes and goingl

1027
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:15,211
Who is it? Who is it?..

1028
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:21,549
Who is it? Who is it?..

1029
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:26,692
The one who stayed close to me.
The one who stayed away ftom me.

1030
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:31,731
The answer came as the questionl
As the separation who stayed away.

1031
01:19:33,301 --> 01:19:38,136
Who is it? Who is it?..

1032
01:19:38,306 --> 01:19:43,710
Who is it? Who is it?..

1033
01:19:58,727 --> 01:19:59,591
Oh Godl

1034
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:23,808
A tussle goes on in me
in the morning and evening.

1035
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:28,486
Oh moml

1036
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:33,753
Kathakali (Classic dance)
in my mind goes on when l sleep.

1037
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:43,400
A tussle goes on in me
in the morning and evening.

1038
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:48,407
Kathakali in my mind
goes on when l sleep.

1039
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:53,412
She is in me in the day,
in the night and in my mind

1040
01:20:53,548 --> 01:20:58,110
She is in my dream and
in reality like a shadowl

1041
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:02,316
My heart searches for her everywhere.

1042
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:07,326
Who is it? Who is it?..

1043
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:47,891
She gets down on the top of my head
like a dragonl

1044
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:52,769
After getting down in me
she starts torturing me.

1045
01:21:52,908 --> 01:21:57,845
She makes it impossible
to find her out among others.

1046
01:21:57,946 --> 01:22:02,474
Her face is more attractive than othersl

1047
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:07,044
She makes love to me being invisiblel

1048
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:11,648
Who is it? Who is it?..

1049
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:16,593
Who is it? Who is it?..

1050
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:21,599
The one who tortures my mind.

1051
01:22:22,370 --> 01:22:26,238
The one who closes the eyes and goingl

1052
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:30,602
Who is it? Who is it?..

1053
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:37,074
Who is it? Who is it?..

1054
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:39,883
The one who stayed close to me.

1055
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:42,319
The one who stayed away ftom me.

1056
01:22:42,490 --> 01:22:44,856
The answer came as the questionl

1057
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:47,427
As the separation..

1058
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:55,668
Ok, l couldn't find you out.

1059
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:59,804
Ok tell me now.
What is your original name?

1060
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:02,603
-Ammukutty!
-You are lying

1061
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:05,805
Ok tell me
in which class you are studying?

1062
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:08,345
At least you can tell me
which department.

1063
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:12,452
Why? To find me out and scold, right?

1064
01:23:13,421 --> 01:23:16,254
No, Now l am not angry with you

1065
01:23:16,424 --> 01:23:18,790
Then, have you started to love me?

1066
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:22,396
lt is..

1067
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:25,290
How can l love without seeing
you in person?

1068
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:26,229
You can see

1069
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:30,170
You've to stop going
behind that girl

1070
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:33,939
Behind the girl?
What do you mean?

1071
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:35,009
Behind Meera?

1072
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:39,471
l don't like you roaming
behind her like a tail

1073
01:23:40,882 --> 01:23:41,974
What is she thinking herself?

1074
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:43,311
ls she the Miss World?

1075
01:23:43,451 --> 01:23:47,046
Why does she overact making you being
a gem of a person roaming behind her?

1076
01:23:47,222 --> 01:23:48,348
Stop it

1077
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:53,420
Who are you to talk nonsense
about our Meera?

1078
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:58,756
lt's enough. l don't need to know your
whereabouts and details

1079
01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:00,095
Don't call me again

1080
01:24:19,120 --> 01:24:20,815
l told you not to call me again.

1081
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:21,889
Then why did you call me?

1082
01:24:22,023 --> 01:24:24,685
-Cut the call
-Don't cut it.

1083
01:24:25,493 --> 01:24:28,018
Henceforth l won't talk
anything wrong about Meera

1084
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,123
You can't find anything wrong about her

1085
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:36,327
When you talk about Meera
l wish to know more about her.

1086
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:37,335
Will you tell me?

1087
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:39,004
What will you do by knowing that?

1088
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:43,472
lf l behave like her,
you will like me. That's why

1089
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:46,873
Why have you become silent?

1090
01:24:47,449 --> 01:24:50,885
lt is not money
to earn

1091
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,418
lt is character
lt should come by birth

1092
01:24:54,956 --> 01:24:56,218
Just know one thing

1093
01:24:56,591 --> 01:25:01,722
Have you ever seen a boss daughter..

1094
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:04,224
..who mingle closely with
their garments company workers?

1095
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:07,797
lt is Semmanooru
Muthuramaiah's daughter..

1096
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:09,768
..our Meera

1097
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:15,701
Once upon a time our sir always
entered into troubles..

1098
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:20,504
..but our Meera changed him and
made him to be praised by people

1099
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:27,077
Barlier l too have thought to attain
anything by force and roamed as a rogue.

1100
01:25:27,255 --> 01:25:30,088
But our Meera made me to understand that..

1101
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,590
..strength is not suitable to rule the
nation and it is suitable to the forest

1102
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:37,529
..and you've to rule everything
by the love

1103
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:42,530
lt is my duty coming
as escort for Muthuramaiah

1104
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:47,670
Now l feel as a honor
to be a protector to Meera

1105
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:55,975
l got angry when you told
nonsense about Meera

1106
01:25:56,251 --> 01:25:58,412
That's why l scolded you

1107
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,349
Why do you say sorry?

1108
01:26:05,927 --> 01:26:07,554
lt is me who has done the mistake

1109
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:11,755
Now l've understood clearly

1110
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,136
Not about her
...about you

1111
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:25,328
Bhoomi! Do you want
to see me in person?

1112
01:27:25,473 --> 01:27:28,738
-Yes l want to
-Then, come out

1113
01:27:30,511 --> 01:27:32,001
l am in the garden

1114
01:27:33,715 --> 01:27:36,115
-Come forward
-Where are you?

1115
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:37,113
Here only

1116
01:27:37,218 --> 01:27:39,550
Can't you see that
l am standing under the tree?

1117
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,951
Hey, stop
Stop there

1118
01:27:44,292 --> 01:27:45,691
l'll come close to you

1119
01:27:46,027 --> 01:27:47,255
Close your eyes and stay there

1120
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:49,589
Open your eyes atter l tell you

1121
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:52,827
-Come fast
-Why are you in hurry?

1122
01:27:53,134 --> 01:27:55,295
l am coming close to you

1123
01:27:56,271 --> 01:27:57,898
Now open your eyes

1124
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:02,042
You've spoiled everything

1125
01:28:02,143 --> 01:28:04,043
Did l ask you for tea at this time?

1126
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:05,578
That's Poongodi, boss

1127
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:07,314
Because she did her duty correct..

1128
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,575
..sir made her pregnant
in that house

1129
01:28:10,051 --> 01:28:12,349
What? Pregnant?

1130
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:15,922
Oh God! lt is not pregnant
it is permanent

1131
01:28:16,691 --> 01:28:19,626
-Pregnant means carrying
-Carrying?

1132
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:20,859
Ok, go

1133
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,259
Why did you tell this before him?

1134
01:28:22,363 --> 01:28:23,625
You could have told it to me later

1135
01:28:23,831 --> 01:28:26,299
-Because of this Bnglish
l have felt ashamed otten -Leave it.

1136
01:28:27,702 --> 01:28:29,260
-Hey Amaavasyaa!
-What boss?

1137
01:28:29,671 --> 01:28:31,502
-Today she came in my dream
-What?

1138
01:28:31,706 --> 01:28:32,968
Did my Poongodi come in your dream?

1139
01:28:33,141 --> 01:28:35,609
Having engagement with me,
are you coming in others' dreams?

1140
01:28:36,644 --> 01:28:39,545
Not her. lt is Ammukutty!

1141
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:42,739
Ammukutty!
l felt scared

1142
01:28:42,884 --> 01:28:45,079
Have you seen Ammukutty?

1143
01:28:45,386 --> 01:28:47,183
Your Poongodi didn't allow
me to see her face

1144
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:49,256
She came at the right time and woke me up

1145
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,291
Did she wake you up?
Then, were you in sleep?

1146
01:28:52,493 --> 01:28:55,326
What is this boss? Why didn't you wake up
when she was coming here?

1147
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:59,698
-Dreams will come in sleep, you idiot!
-Not like that

1148
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,263
Dreams should come
when you are in sense

1149
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:04,336
Bharthiyaar said it is called true love

1150
01:29:05,873 --> 01:29:07,704
Was it Bharthiyaar or Bharathi Raja?

1151
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,745
So pity! He got confused

1152
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,980
l'll tell you one thing

1153
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,582
Love and marriage are like journey

1154
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:18,183
Love is like bus journey

1155
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,852
lf we don't like,
we can get down in the way.

1156
01:29:20,088 --> 01:29:21,851
Marriage is like air plane journey

1157
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,718
lf we don't like it,
we can't get down in the middle

1158
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,120
We'll die

1159
01:29:27,228 --> 01:29:30,527
Go away. Nonsense!

1160
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:34,065
Where is the bodyguard?

1161
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:36,199
He has gone to ladies hostel

1162
01:29:38,473 --> 01:29:45,709
AMMUKUTTY

1163
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:49,405
Why are you standing here
like in the airport?

1164
01:29:49,517 --> 01:29:51,678
Nothing boss, seeing this name
they will come here.

1165
01:29:51,819 --> 01:29:52,717
That's why this setup

1166
01:29:52,987 --> 01:29:54,682
-Boss!
-Damn your idea!

1167
01:29:55,256 --> 01:29:56,280
The board has broken

1168
01:29:56,424 --> 01:29:58,585
Why boss? Why did you tear Ammukutty?

1169
01:29:58,860 --> 01:30:01,886
-Ammukutty is not her real name
-Oh god!

1170
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,589
Then how can we find out that girl?

1171
01:30:04,732 --> 01:30:05,824
She'll call me now

1172
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,226
l'll keep chatting with her

1173
01:30:07,335 --> 01:30:09,235
Meanwhile you enter into the hostel and..

1174
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:12,100
..if any girl is talking in the phone
you take her photo and come back

1175
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:13,240
She will be Ammukutty

1176
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:18,270
-Boss! Phone is ringing
-lt is her

1177
01:30:18,546 --> 01:30:20,741
ls it her? Then while you
are talking with her..

1178
01:30:20,848 --> 01:30:21,906
..ask her in which room
she is in and tell me

1179
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:23,414
l'll take her photo with her permission

1180
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:26,385
l know your feeling

1181
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:27,385
Then do one thing

1182
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:29,285
While you are talking with her,
make her to come out

1183
01:30:29,457 --> 01:30:30,924
l'll take her photo without her knowledge

1184
01:30:31,492 --> 01:30:33,790
Oh god! This too didn't work out

1185
01:30:34,462 --> 01:30:35,724
Where do you go?
Go backside

1186
01:30:40,334 --> 01:30:42,768
At morning
what are you doing before our hostel?

1187
01:30:43,704 --> 01:30:47,401
Are you staying in this hostel?
l couldn't imagine.

1188
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:51,140
What is your room number?

1189
01:30:51,546 --> 01:30:54,538
Do you want my room number
or my phone number?

1190
01:30:56,117 --> 01:30:57,175
No need to tell

1191
01:30:57,985 --> 01:30:59,077
l myself will find it out

1192
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:01,017
would do what l was told

1193
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:02,520
l don't know other than that

1194
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:04,418
How can it possible to meet at once?

1195
01:31:04,725 --> 01:31:06,818
l'll tell you the time to our meeting

1196
01:31:07,528 --> 01:31:10,019
You don't want to tell

1197
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,190
l've seen you, isn't it?

1198
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:14,960
Try to listen to me!

1199
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:17,294
l am telling you
that today is not possible

1200
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:19,335
She is showing her back to me

1201
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,334
l'll go before her and
take a photo of her face

1202
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,577
-Who is it?
-What are you doing?

1203
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:26,974
-l am not doing anything
-What are you doing?

1204
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:34,180
What is she saying in Bnglish?

1205
01:31:34,856 --> 01:31:37,017
May be she is that girl

1206
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:40,256
l'll take her photo too

1207
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:44,860
-Thank god! No one is here
-Why did you come here?

1208
01:31:45,032 --> 01:31:46,363
How many times should l tell you
not to come here?

1209
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:54,003
What is this?
Whole gang is speaking in the cell phone

1210
01:31:56,377 --> 01:31:58,675
l am confused

1211
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:00,035
No confusion

1212
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:02,340
l'll take all of these girls photos
and show him

1213
01:32:02,450 --> 01:32:03,610
Let him pick it her up

1214
01:32:07,221 --> 01:32:08,188
-Who are you?
-Who is that?

1215
01:32:08,289 --> 01:32:10,348
-Thief! -Thief?
-Come fast

1216
01:32:10,525 --> 01:32:12,425
Why did he come at this moment?

1217
01:32:12,627 --> 01:32:14,094
They are giving me a lot of work.

1218
01:32:14,228 --> 01:32:17,755
-Where is he madam?
-Come girls, let's catch the thief

1219
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:23,501
-You -Madam,
why are you hitting me?

1220
01:32:28,676 --> 01:32:32,840
Not only taking the girls photos
Do you want to kiss me?

1221
01:32:35,249 --> 01:32:37,740
Girls, bash him off

1222
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,388
Slowly! Slowly! Don't throw me down

1223
01:32:44,625 --> 01:32:45,717
Take me slowly

1224
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,393
ls there any struggle?

1225
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:51,257
l think some mad guy
has fallen down from the building

1226
01:32:51,499 --> 01:32:53,490
They are taking him to the hospital

1227
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:56,660
-Ok, l'll call you in the evening
-Don't cut the call

1228
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:59,233
-You go ahead
-He is busy.

1229
01:32:59,941 --> 01:33:03,240
ls he shouting?
Cut his tongue

1230
01:33:04,378 --> 01:33:05,777
Yes!

1231
01:33:10,151 --> 01:33:11,550
ls it my party going there?

1232
01:33:11,786 --> 01:33:13,083
You call me in the evening

1233
01:33:13,254 --> 01:33:15,085
Give me the body!

1234
01:33:23,998 --> 01:33:27,764
Slowly! Oh mom!

1235
01:33:28,202 --> 01:33:29,760
Don't pull me as you wish!

1236
01:33:30,004 --> 01:33:31,904
My parts could break up

1237
01:33:33,207 --> 01:33:35,641
Where we are now?

1238
01:33:36,077 --> 01:33:37,044
ln the toilet?

1239
01:33:37,678 --> 01:33:39,111
-ln the house
-House!

1240
01:33:39,313 --> 01:33:41,372
Atter coming in the auto
it still is in my mind.

1241
01:33:41,582 --> 01:33:44,244
-Oh gosh! Uncle!
-Yes, it is me -What is this?

1242
01:33:44,352 --> 01:33:45,979
-How has it happened?
-Nothing -Nothing?

1243
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,252
He has just fallen down

1244
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:50,049
-Where has he fallen down?
-Tell her clearly that l was beaten

1245
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:51,454
Beaten?
Then didn't you fall down?

1246
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:55,184
l fell down at everyone's feet
telling not to hit me

1247
01:33:55,429 --> 01:33:59,388
When l fell down at their feet
they stamped me

1248
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:00,829
How many people?

1249
01:34:00,935 --> 01:34:02,960
How could l count them
when l was getting beats?

1250
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,970
How could l count
when they hit in my mouth?

1251
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:10,203
Among them,
one fat lady looks like learnt Karate

1252
01:34:10,678 --> 01:34:12,976
Her slaps are different from others

1253
01:34:13,114 --> 01:34:18,882
When she kicked me with her leg,
my balls came to here

1254
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:20,351
-Shut up your mouth
-Then l closed my mouth..

1255
01:34:20,488 --> 01:34:21,978
..else it would've come out

1256
01:34:22,556 --> 01:34:26,492
Atter that, l have toiled much
to get the things in it's own place

1257
01:34:26,661 --> 01:34:29,186
-Only my creator knew my pain
-Why did you get hurt like this?

1258
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:32,322
Did l get it by giving money?

1259
01:34:32,533 --> 01:34:35,366
When l said no,
they hit me black and blue

1260
01:34:35,770 --> 01:34:37,397
Where were you in that situation?

1261
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:40,030
l received an important call.
That's why..

1262
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:43,404
Because of that phone call
this has happened

1263
01:34:43,711 --> 01:34:45,508
Boss! You be brave

1264
01:34:45,713 --> 01:34:47,908
l'll find out your problem
before l die.

1265
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:02,251
Come dad!

1266
01:35:03,364 --> 01:35:06,891
-Sir! When did you come?
-l had a meeting here

1267
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:08,693
On the way l came to see Meera

1268
01:35:08,969 --> 01:35:10,561
Bhoomi! When will your college close down?

1269
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:12,869
Next month 25th

1270
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:15,065
-You come to our house the next day
-Ok

1271
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:17,411
All are waiting for Meera's exam

1272
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:19,403
Atter her exams,
she has to go to London

1273
01:35:19,613 --> 01:35:22,582
We've decided to conduct
her marriage there

1274
01:35:33,127 --> 01:35:35,061
Why are you sitting here alone?

1275
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:36,829
Nothing.
Just sitting

1276
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:37,829
Come, let's go in the room

1277
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:39,762
lt's ok, let's sit down here
for a while

1278
01:35:40,568 --> 01:35:41,500
Sit down!

1279
01:35:46,941 --> 01:35:50,900
l was thinking to tell you
something for a long time

1280
01:35:51,112 --> 01:35:54,707
Tell me. Tell me whatever it is

1281
01:35:57,485 --> 01:35:59,646
Why did you keep your phone there?
Dad is on the line

1282
01:35:59,820 --> 01:36:00,752
Come fast!

1283
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,430
Dad didn't call you
l lied you

1284
01:36:15,936 --> 01:36:18,097
Why are you talking alone
with Bhoomi at this time?

1285
01:36:20,107 --> 01:36:22,268
That is..
just nothing

1286
01:36:22,443 --> 01:36:24,434
By seeing your behaviour
l feel scared

1287
01:36:24,678 --> 01:36:26,612
Already your engagement is over

1288
01:36:27,381 --> 01:36:29,440
But God's decision is different

1289
01:36:29,683 --> 01:36:31,548
Blse Bhoomi wouldn't have
entered into my life

1290
01:36:31,852 --> 01:36:34,787
As you think he is not loving you Meera

1291
01:36:35,022 --> 01:36:36,284
Now l am not Meera

1292
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:39,081
lt's enough for me
if l live as his lover

1293
01:36:41,262 --> 01:36:43,662
l can't be without him

1294
01:36:44,198 --> 01:36:45,893
What if your father knows this?

1295
01:36:47,168 --> 01:36:48,396
lf Bhoomi knows about this,

1296
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:51,538
..do you think that he'll fight
for you with your dad and take you?

1297
01:36:54,275 --> 01:36:55,970
You haven't understood him clearly

1298
01:36:56,343 --> 01:37:01,178
Because he is having faith on your father
he can't betray your father

1299
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,749
lf he knows that you are
he girl talking on the phone..

1300
01:37:06,854 --> 01:37:07,980
..he won't accept you

1301
01:37:08,422 --> 01:37:10,652
He'll handover you
to your parents and go his way

1302
01:37:10,991 --> 01:37:12,686
This is what is going to happen.

1303
01:37:18,232 --> 01:37:19,665
Kamaraj said before that
if a tile breaks, we can change it..

1304
01:37:19,867 --> 01:37:23,598
..but we can't change
if mind break.

1305
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:28,004
Kamaraj or Suruli Rajan?

1306
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:32,675
So pity! He got confused

1307
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:34,613
Take that tile.

1308
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:37,182
He is doing his duty
but l have confused him.

1309
01:37:39,053 --> 01:37:40,145
Hold it strong.

1310
01:37:40,387 --> 01:37:43,083
-Don't leave me and go annoyed.
-Ok.

1311
01:37:45,926 --> 01:37:48,019
Run, run (Tile)

1312
01:37:50,664 --> 01:37:53,690
Oh God!

1313
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:01,032
Who?

1314
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:06,313
Oh God!

1315
01:38:13,921 --> 01:38:15,047
Why don't you call me?

1316
01:38:15,289 --> 01:38:16,620
Did you wake up late?

1317
01:38:16,924 --> 01:38:18,585
First l have to sleep for that. lsn't it?

1318
01:38:18,792 --> 01:38:19,850
Me too.

1319
01:38:20,694 --> 01:38:22,628
l had a dream about you in the dawn.

1320
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:25,465
How was l looking in your dream?

1321
01:38:25,766 --> 01:38:27,893
Who knows that?

1322
01:38:28,302 --> 01:38:30,270
Hence you don't need to see in your dream.

1323
01:38:30,838 --> 01:38:32,100
l'll meet you.

1324
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:34,070
lt is a lie.

1325
01:38:34,808 --> 01:38:36,799
No, l'll come.

1326
01:38:37,845 --> 01:38:40,006
-Really?
-Why do you suspect me?

1327
01:38:40,547 --> 01:38:41,809
l am telling that l will come.

1328
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:44,646
Tell me. Where are you now?
l will come immediately.

1329
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:47,086
Oh! Not now.

1330
01:38:48,122 --> 01:38:50,283
Will you come on next Sunday
at the botanical garden?

1331
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,126
One minute.

1332
01:38:53,327 --> 01:38:54,954
Wait for a minute.

1333
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:56,489
He is coming here.

1334
01:39:09,677 --> 01:39:12,646
Do you have any program on next Sunday?

1335
01:39:14,615 --> 01:39:16,310
We don't go anywhere. Why?

1336
01:39:17,518 --> 01:39:20,453
l have to go one place. That's why.

1337
01:39:20,554 --> 01:39:24,513
-Where?
-To meet a doctor.

1338
01:39:29,396 --> 01:39:31,728
lf you have any program
l won't go.

1339
01:39:31,899 --> 01:39:33,799
l will cancel meeting the doctor!

1340
01:39:34,702 --> 01:39:36,693
No, you can go on Sunday.

1341
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:45,739

1342
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:47,411

l'll come there at 2.45pm

1345
01:39:54,755 --> 01:39:58,521
You didn't say your real name.

1346
01:39:59,827 --> 01:40:02,887
We are going to meet each other.
Then what?

1347
01:40:04,064 --> 01:40:05,929
Ok. We will meet on Sunday at 3'o clock.

1348
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:35,685
Rhythmic heart beats are
same as the rain and train

1349
01:40:35,796 --> 01:40:37,354
Little comfort and little pain.

1350
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:42,491
Rhythmic heart beats are
same as the rain and train

1351
01:40:42,603 --> 01:40:44,093
Little comfort and little pain.

1352
01:40:44,204 --> 01:40:50,404
Will she come fast or make me wait?

1353
01:40:51,278 --> 01:40:55,237
Will she stare at me or
give her seductive smile?

1354
01:40:56,417 --> 01:41:00,581
Will she kiss me only if asked
or hug me on her own?

1355
01:41:01,522 --> 01:41:05,083
Will she make love
with me and kill me?

Little comfort and little pain.

1358
01:41:42,696 --> 01:41:46,132
My mind thinks about you
without any control.

1359
01:41:46,233 --> 01:41:48,895
..and it dances with joyl

1360
01:41:49,536 --> 01:41:55,907
Without any language to tell me
Tamil words are becharming.

1361
01:41:56,477 --> 01:42:02,643
My desire is boundless
in the love street.

1362
01:42:03,283 --> 01:42:09,483
ln the memories, the shadow gets burst.

1363

Little comfort and little pain.

1367
01:42:52,733 --> 01:42:56,464
The water of river Ganges
caught up in the conch..

1368
01:42:56,570 --> 01:42:59,437
..and craves to go to other shore.

1369
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:06,368
A small child by keeping a dream
is without a sleep.

1370
01:43:06,780 --> 01:43:13,208
You have to come before me soon.

1371

Show me your face in my dream
till you come before me.

1372
01:43:21,195 --> 01:43:24,289

..are hurrying me up to see youl

Little comfort and little pain.

Rhythmic heart beats are

1377
01:43:41,181 --> 01:43:42,512
Little comfort and little pain.

Will she come fast or make me wait?

1379
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:54,420
Will she stare at me or

Will she kiss me only if asked
or hug me on her own?

1386
01:44:23,223 --> 01:44:25,919
l fixed the appointment today
because you said on that day

1387
01:44:26,026 --> 01:44:27,653
..that you have no program today.

1388
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:30,121

01:44:33,967 --> 01:44:38,267
No, doctor told that l have come alone.

1392
01:44:38,705 --> 01:44:40,002
You go alone.

1393
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:41,938
We will stand outside the consulting room.

1394
01:44:42,109 --> 01:44:44,134
-Doctor will not accept it.
-Why?

1395
01:44:44,978 --> 01:44:47,469
Because doctor have no consulting room.

Which doctor is that?

1397
01:44:49,449 --> 01:44:51,076
That means l want to meet that doctor.

1398
01:44:51,184 --> 01:44:52,151
What is his name?

1399
01:44:52,519 --> 01:44:55,613
He is not a big doctor to tell his name.

1400
01:44:55,722 --> 01:44:58,088
We will call as doctor.

1401
01:45:00,193 --> 01:45:01,558
Bverything you tell are lies.

1402
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:03,557
Tell the truth. Where are you going?

1403

1404
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:09,701
Why are you hiding it from me?

1405
01:45:10,671 --> 01:45:14,971
My friend is a girl.

1406
01:45:17,944 --> 01:45:20,174
-Girl?
-Yes!

1407
01:45:20,681 --> 01:45:22,512
She is studying in our college.

01:45:22,816 --> 01:45:26,377
She has called me otten.

1409
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:28,713

l am going to see her.

1417
01:45:53,380 --> 01:45:56,008
lf she doesn't look beautiful
when you see her in person?

1418
01:45:56,116 --> 01:45:59,608
Beauty is only for our eyes.
Not for our mind.

1419
01:46:01,655 --> 01:46:05,614
When l see her
will my love in my mind vanish?

1420
01:46:07,060 --> 01:46:09,153
Ok, you have to tell it earlier. lsn't it?

1421
01:46:09,262 --> 01:46:10,422
Why are you wasting the time?

Shall l come with you?

1426
01:46:26,146 --> 01:46:27,841
Oh! No!

1427
01:46:27,948 --> 01:46:29,973
lf you come with me
she won't like that.

1428
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:33,186
Already she had a fight with me
that l am following you.

1429
01:46:33,286 --> 01:46:34,446
She can't see me.

1430
01:46:34,554 --> 01:46:36,249
l'll hide and see her.

1431
01:46:37,157 --> 01:46:41,116
-ls all this necessary?
-Yes, l want to see her.

You be stand here.

You can see both of us from here.

1435
01:47:06,386 --> 01:47:07,876
Time is not moving.

1436
01:47:07,988 --> 01:47:09,421
There is half an hour to go.

1437
01:47:12,459 --> 01:47:14,825
Will you do a help for me?

1438
01:47:15,395 --> 01:47:16,293
Tell me.

1439
01:47:18,198 --> 01:47:20,428
Now you are Ammu.

1440
01:47:22,068 --> 01:47:25,037
You just think like that.

1441
01:47:25,672 --> 01:47:30,632
l'll just practice with you
what l am going to say her.

1442
01:47:31,878 --> 01:47:32,708
Ok?

1443
01:47:43,957 --> 01:47:44,855
Have you come?

1444
01:47:46,893 --> 01:47:48,520
l couldn't believe it.

1445
01:47:50,163 --> 01:47:54,122
These days you didn't meet me..
and why did you do like this?

1446
01:47:55,302 --> 01:48:01,866
Do you love me truly?
Or are you kidding me?

1447
01:48:03,643 --> 01:48:05,941
That day l couldn't say anything to you..

1448
01:48:06,847 --> 01:48:10,339
..when you proposed me through the phone.

1449
01:48:11,985 --> 01:48:13,885
But now l am telling you in person.

1450
01:48:30,403 --> 01:48:33,031
ls this ok to speak like this?

1451
01:48:34,941 --> 01:48:36,499
Now l am confident.

1452
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:44,172
Why don't you say all the best?

1453
01:49:50,150 --> 01:49:50,980
Have you come?

1454
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:52,581
Where are you?

1455
01:49:53,687 --> 01:49:54,585
Did you see me?

1456
01:49:54,888 --> 01:49:56,253
l don't want to see you.

1457
01:49:59,225 --> 01:50:00,988
Hence forth you won't see me.

1458
01:50:03,296 --> 01:50:05,526
Though l have told you
that Meera shouldn't come..

1459
01:50:05,632 --> 01:50:08,931
..you touched her shoulder
and brought here.

1460
01:50:09,502 --> 01:50:11,663
Ammu, l didn't do anything wrong.

1461
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:13,602
Do you think that l didn't see that?

1462
01:50:15,108 --> 01:50:17,133
You are lying and cheating me

1463
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:24,812
l couldn't say no when
she said she would come with me.

1464
01:50:25,318 --> 01:50:26,148
That's why..

1465
01:50:26,386 --> 01:50:29,355
Then you are giving more
importance than me. lsn't it?

1466
01:50:29,923 --> 01:50:31,550
Nothing like that.

1467
01:50:31,658 --> 01:50:34,092
You couldn't do at least
this small thing for me..

1468
01:50:34,194 --> 01:50:35,286
..then how can l believe you?

1469
01:50:35,662 --> 01:50:38,392
How can l marry you
and live with you?

1470
01:50:38,698 --> 01:50:41,132
What if you cheat me again and
how can l believe you?

1471
01:50:41,301 --> 01:50:42,734
l am not a guy as you think.

1472
01:50:43,103 --> 01:50:44,730
l won't do like that.

1473
01:50:44,838 --> 01:50:46,669
No, you don't need tell anything.

1474
01:50:46,906 --> 01:50:48,339
l won't call you again.

1475
01:50:48,708 --> 01:50:50,608
You don't need to wait for my call.

1476
01:51:32,018 --> 01:51:33,918
Where? Has she come?

1477
01:51:34,754 --> 01:51:36,449
No, she has not come.

1478
01:51:36,556 --> 01:51:37,921
Didn't she come? Why?

1479
01:51:38,425 --> 01:51:43,124
-She got angry because she have seen you
-Then?

1480
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:46,924
She cut the call
saying that she won't call me.

1481
01:51:47,033 --> 01:51:48,728
Oh God! l did a wrong thing.

1482
01:51:49,035 --> 01:51:50,263
l wouldn't have come here. lsn't it?

1483
01:51:50,370 --> 01:51:51,803
Nothing like that.

1484
01:51:52,105 --> 01:51:57,065
Definitely she will call me
though she has said like that.

1485
01:51:57,911 --> 01:51:58,741
Come.

1486
01:51:59,913 --> 01:52:02,882
How do you say that
she will call you again?

1487
01:52:03,917 --> 01:52:06,408
lf she loves me truly
definitely she will call me.

1488
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:08,817
Definitely she will call me.

1489
01:52:19,866 --> 01:52:20,764
What is this?

1490
01:52:20,867 --> 01:52:22,300
You have only one week
for your exam.

1491
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:24,029
Why don't you study?

1492

Why should l study?

1493
01:52:25,939 --> 01:52:27,429
They only will study

l have come here for being your bodyguard.

1495

Not to write the exam and get passed.

1496

1498
01:52:40,353 --> 01:52:42,514
lf you don't write the exam
we won't also write the exam.

1499
01:52:44,224 --> 01:52:45,657
Why don't you write the exam?

1500
01:52:45,759 --> 01:52:46,657
Because of you.

1501
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,455
You don't write the exam.
that's why we too wouldn't write the exam

Now only a problem is solved.

1507
01:53:44,884 --> 01:53:46,511
Why do you start again by your call?

1508
01:53:46,753 --> 01:53:48,380
You are also seeing him. lsn't it?

1509
01:53:48,488 --> 01:53:51,787
lf l don't call him

Will you love me with
your eye lash's beauty

1555
01:57:36,849 --> 01:57:41,616
When butterfly calls,
don't go, you flowers.

1556
01:57:41,854 --> 01:57:46,791
Don't talk while enjoying
the honey of lovel

lf l am near you..
My heart would feel happy..

1560
01:58:32,205 --> 01:58:36,835
l have born newly
when my heart starts to beat twice

1561
01:58:36,976 --> 01:58:41,845
l will lay on your lap
in the pleasant evening

1562
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:46,942
l will become as a tattoo
in your chest

1563
01:58:47,220 --> 01:58:52,089
The Moon is faraway..
The dame is close to me

1564
01:58:52,258 --> 01:58:56,786
lf l drench in your love
the fever will flee away

1565
01:58:56,929 --> 01:59:01,593
When butterfly calls,
don't go, you flowers.

1566
01:59:01,968 --> 01:59:06,564
Don't talk while enjoying
the honey of lovel

1567
01:59:06,906 --> 01:59:08,999
You are the idol made of ivoryl

1568
01:59:09,108 --> 01:59:11,872
You are valuable as the goldl

1569
01:59:11,978 --> 01:59:17,041
You've trapped me in the net of love.

1570
01:59:38,638 --> 01:59:39,570
Call has come.

1571
01:59:39,906 --> 01:59:41,601
First you ask her phone number.

1572
01:59:41,741 --> 01:59:42,765
You speak later about other matter.

1573
01:59:45,611 --> 01:59:46,543
Tell me.

1574
01:59:46,612 --> 01:59:47,977
Did you write the exam well?

1575
01:59:48,281 --> 01:59:49,873
l have wrote the exam well.

1576
01:59:50,483 --> 01:59:52,576
Do you remember the
promise what you said to me?

1577
01:59:54,487 --> 01:59:55,647
Why are you silent?

1578
01:59:55,788 --> 01:59:56,755
You will come, isn't it?

1579
01:59:58,124 --> 02:00:01,753
No, l won't come.

1580
02:00:03,229 --> 02:00:04,924
l can't come in front of you.

1581
02:00:05,064 --> 02:00:08,795
Why? Do you have any problem about caste,
religion, poor or rich?

1582
02:00:09,468 --> 02:00:10,958
Assume that it's all there.

1583
02:00:11,404 --> 02:00:13,929
Look, it is not big problem.

1584
02:00:14,307 --> 02:00:16,104
l want to see you.
You must come.

1585
02:00:16,242 --> 02:00:17,937
lf l come, l can't go back.

1586
02:00:18,411 --> 02:00:21,676
-You have to take me with you.
-Are you kidding me?

1587
02:00:21,847 --> 02:00:23,178
l am asking you seriously..

1588
02:00:23,849 --> 02:00:25,248
Will you take me with you?

1589
02:00:25,718 --> 02:00:28,118
lf you come, l will take
you along with me.

1590
02:00:29,255 --> 02:00:30,483
You don't say just like that.

1591
02:00:30,690 --> 02:00:31,816
Think well and tell me.

1592
02:00:32,258 --> 02:00:35,386
-My dad has not ordinary man.
-l am not worry about that.

1593
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:38,728
lf you come with me,
l will take you along with me.

1594
02:00:40,733 --> 02:00:41,961
Whoever l am..

1595
02:00:42,201 --> 02:00:44,135
Whoever you are,
and you are looking ugly..

1596
02:00:44,403 --> 02:00:47,372
lf you come with me,
definitely l'll take you with me.

1597
02:00:47,573 --> 02:00:49,905
Then tomorrow early morning
you have to come to railway station.

1598
02:00:50,009 --> 02:00:50,976
l will also be there.

1599
02:00:51,377 --> 02:00:56,007
l can't. Tomorrow morning
l have to drop Meera in her home.

1600
02:00:57,583 --> 02:01:00,143
l won't be here when
you drop Meera to her home.

1601
02:01:00,519 --> 02:01:02,384
Why? Why you shouldn't be there?

1602
02:01:02,655 --> 02:01:05,055
Our people will take me
with them to home. lsn't it?

1603
02:01:05,291 --> 02:01:07,885
Then, l'll inform to Meera.

1604
02:01:08,361 --> 02:01:09,658
A small request!

1605
02:01:10,196 --> 02:01:13,654
Shall we inform my parents on the way?

1606
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:16,861
No, if it comes to know to my people,
it will be problem.

1607
02:01:18,004 --> 02:01:20,700
l'll call you before l start from here.

1608
02:01:43,829 --> 02:01:45,421
She called me.

1609
02:01:45,931 --> 02:01:48,195
She asked me to come at tomorrow morning.

1610
02:01:48,501 --> 02:01:51,231
She said that she will come with me..

1611
02:01:51,437 --> 02:01:53,701
..before her parents take her with them.

1612
02:02:01,247 --> 02:02:04,444
-What did you say for that?
-l said l'll come.

1613
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:05,908
Why did you say that?

1614
02:02:06,185 --> 02:02:07,812
lf it becomes a problem
because of her people?

1615
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:08,976
Why should l get scared?

1616
02:02:09,555 --> 02:02:11,716
l won't worry even if the whole
town come against me.

1617
02:02:12,024 --> 02:02:14,390
Sir is with me.

1618
02:02:16,462 --> 02:02:21,900
We might not meet again.

1619
02:02:22,635 --> 02:02:28,073
So, will you and Madhu go to your home
with Amavasai and Poonkodi?

1620
02:02:28,774 --> 02:02:29,638
Ok, l will go.

1621
02:02:36,315 --> 02:02:42,117
Both of you pray to god for me.

1622
02:02:51,864 --> 02:02:54,458
Meera, this is correct decision
which you decided now.

1623
02:02:55,034 --> 02:02:56,524
You have not done only for him.

1624
02:02:56,836 --> 02:02:58,303
But you did for yourself too.

1625
02:03:00,172 --> 02:03:01,298
You go boldly.

1626
02:03:01,640 --> 02:03:05,132
l'll take care without
knowing for your parents..

1627
02:03:05,544 --> 02:03:07,978
..till both of you go to a safe place.

1628
02:03:22,995 --> 02:03:24,019
Have you started?

1629
02:03:24,497 --> 02:03:25,896
l just have started from home.

1630
02:03:26,265 --> 02:03:28,665
-Have you started?
-l am getting ready.

1631
02:03:29,034 --> 02:03:31,559
l have to ask before l start from here.

1632
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,163
Will you marry me?

1633
02:03:33,406 --> 02:03:36,341
What are you asking?
Haven't you believed me yet?

1634
02:03:37,376 --> 02:03:39,844
l believe you.
l am asking out of fear.

1635
02:03:40,579 --> 02:03:43,946
lf a little change come when you see me..

1636
02:03:44,450 --> 02:03:45,747
..l won't come with you.

1637
02:03:46,152 --> 02:03:47,517
And l won't go back.

1638
02:03:48,320 --> 02:03:49,617
ln running train..

1639
02:03:50,556 --> 02:03:51,682
Don't talk like this.

1640
02:03:51,957 --> 02:03:54,619
l have told you that you can't
see any change in my face.

1641
02:03:54,794 --> 02:03:55,783
You come boldly.

1642
02:03:56,829 --> 02:03:58,626
l'll call you atter l reached the station.

1643
02:03:58,798 --> 02:04:00,698
You get into the train
with two tickets..

1644
02:04:00,900 --> 02:04:03,198
..in the last train which goes to
the town.

1645
02:04:03,602 --> 02:04:04,694
l will be in that.

1646
02:04:09,108 --> 02:04:11,372
You told that you want to
see your parents. lsn't it?

1647
02:04:11,610 --> 02:04:13,237
Ask them to come at any station.

1648
02:04:13,412 --> 02:04:14,401
We will see them and go.

1649
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:16,514
Ok, l'll call and inform them.

1650
02:04:17,583 --> 02:04:19,517
l'll get into the train
what you said to me.

1651
02:04:19,752 --> 02:04:24,587
lf you are not there
that'll be my last journey of life.

1652
02:04:28,127 --> 02:04:30,823
Dear, that bodyguard has cheated us.

1653
02:04:31,397 --> 02:04:32,887
He did betrayal for us.

1654
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:36,568
He is to elope with our Meera.

1655
02:04:40,039 --> 02:04:42,633
He has much respect for our family.

1656
02:04:43,709 --> 02:04:46,109
He is a honest person.

1657
02:04:46,979 --> 02:04:50,176
He knows that l won't forgive
the one who did the betrayal.

1658
02:04:50,282 --> 02:04:51,544
Oh God! lt is not like that.

1659
02:04:51,951 --> 02:04:53,145
This is our daughter's matter.

1660
02:04:53,652 --> 02:04:55,244
Poonkodi has just informed me.

1661
02:04:55,821 --> 02:04:58,153
She saw them in person when
they speak through the phone.

1662
02:05:10,769 --> 02:05:12,600
-Big problem has happened.
-What?

1663
02:05:13,172 --> 02:05:14,571
Atter you have started from there..

1664
02:05:14,740 --> 02:05:16,901
..a group of guys have come
and kidnapped Meera.

1665
02:05:17,009 --> 02:05:18,442
Kidnapped Meera?
What are you saying?

1666
02:05:19,011 --> 02:05:20,239
They are Devaraj's men.

1667
02:05:20,379 --> 02:05:21,437
Vehicle is going in high way.

1668
02:05:21,580 --> 02:05:22,979
This is that vehicle's number.

1669
02:05:29,488 --> 02:05:30,614
Sir, tell me.

1670
02:05:30,823 --> 02:05:31,949
Where are you now?

1671
02:05:32,224 --> 02:05:33,657
We have crossed the toll gate.

1672
02:05:33,959 --> 02:05:36,860
-Don't stop on the way and come fast.
-Ok sir.

1673
02:05:54,446 --> 02:05:58,280
-Tell me.
-Sir, Bhoomi is following us.

1674
02:06:00,219 --> 02:06:01,811
He shouldn't come near my daughter.

1675
02:06:02,187 --> 02:06:03,484
Do anything to him.

1676
02:06:04,223 --> 02:06:05,349
Go fast.

1677
02:06:07,159 --> 02:06:08,683
Hey, go fast.

1678
02:07:01,313 --> 02:07:03,281
Bhoomi, don't come here. Go.

1679
02:09:24,223 --> 02:09:26,350
Listen to me.
Go from here.

1680
02:09:37,202 --> 02:09:38,294
Oh god! Dad!

1681
02:09:42,040 --> 02:09:44,907
Sir, lt is wrong what l did.

1682
02:09:45,344 --> 02:09:46,641
l wouldn't have gone like that.

1683
02:09:47,379 --> 02:09:49,870
l wished to happen
everything by your blessing.

1684
02:09:50,415 --> 02:09:52,280
But my situation is like that.

1685
02:09:52,518 --> 02:09:55,749
-Pardon me sir.
-Should l pardon you?

1686
02:10:02,127 --> 02:10:03,253
Dad!

1687
02:10:04,363 --> 02:10:06,888
No dad! Don't do anything to him!

1688
02:10:07,132 --> 02:10:08,326
He didn't do any mistake.

1689
02:10:09,101 --> 02:10:12,559
-Take her away.
-Karthi, listen to me. Dad!

1690
02:10:12,805 --> 02:10:13,601
Leave me!

1691
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:19,243
Sir, l didn't do intentionally.

1692
02:10:20,312 --> 02:10:21,802
Please understand my situation.

1693
02:10:28,287 --> 02:10:30,585
l have handed over Meera safely to you.

1694
02:10:30,756 --> 02:10:31,620
Then what?

1695
02:10:36,562 --> 02:10:38,621
Leave me!
Oh God! Bhoomi!

1696
02:10:42,234 --> 02:10:43,223
Dad! One minute!

1697
02:10:43,502 --> 02:10:45,163
Please understand what he is going to say.

1698
02:10:45,537 --> 02:10:46,902
He loves a girl.

1699
02:10:47,105 --> 02:10:48,538
She said that she have
come to the station..

1700
02:10:48,640 --> 02:10:50,198
..that's why he went there to leave me.

1701
02:10:50,409 --> 02:10:52,639
He didn't do any mistake as you think.

1702
02:10:54,413 --> 02:10:58,645
Yes sir. She is waiting for me
in the railway station.

1703
02:11:00,319 --> 02:11:03,254
lf l don't go
then she will..

1704
02:11:04,089 --> 02:11:05,249
Dad! Please..

1705
02:11:05,691 --> 02:11:07,158
lt is true what he is telling to me.

1706
02:11:07,492 --> 02:11:09,585
Please leave him.

1707
02:11:11,496 --> 02:11:12,986
-Ok, you go.
-Dad!

1708
02:11:15,968 --> 02:11:16,992
You can go!

1709
02:11:19,805 --> 02:11:21,102
Bye sir!

1710
02:11:23,542 --> 02:11:26,511
Meera, l'll go.

1711
02:12:00,579 --> 02:12:05,642
Your dad might think
only about death at that time.

1712
02:12:06,084 --> 02:12:12,114
lf l didn't get into the train at the
last minute that would happen.

1713
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,058
Station will come soon.

1714
02:12:25,270 --> 02:12:26,897
Get ready with your things.

1715
02:12:27,105 --> 02:12:29,403
Meeting has not finished for me.
l am in next cabin.

1716
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:38,074
How much you loved my mother?

1717
02:12:44,323 --> 02:12:45,790
Why did you ask suddenly?

1718
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:48,416
Your mother is life for me.

1719
02:12:50,662 --> 02:12:53,028
Your mother also loved me very much.

1720
02:12:56,201 --> 02:12:57,668
She have told me that
l wouldn't go to Semmanoor..

1721
02:12:57,970 --> 02:13:01,371
..before her death.

1722
02:13:02,174 --> 02:13:05,769
l agreed because you are very stubborn.

1723
02:13:16,288 --> 02:13:18,620
Come. How was your journey?

1724
02:13:19,024 --> 02:13:20,116
Where is your son?

1725
02:13:20,425 --> 02:13:23,861
Come. l am waiting for you.

1726
02:13:37,876 --> 02:13:38,843
Come.

1727
02:13:43,315 --> 02:13:46,614
Sir, see who has come!

1728
02:13:56,528 --> 02:13:58,894
Bhoomi, have you come? Come.

1729
02:13:59,031 --> 02:14:01,829
-Sir, you take rest.
-l am alright.

1730
02:14:02,534 --> 02:14:03,432
Sit down!

1731
02:14:06,238 --> 02:14:07,899
l thought you wouldn't come.

1732
02:14:08,006 --> 02:14:10,440
Will l refuse your words?

1733
02:14:10,942 --> 02:14:13,035
Sakkarapani said that
your next posting is in Australia..

1734
02:14:13,578 --> 02:14:16,172
..and you have come
to this town in the middle.

1735
02:14:16,515 --> 02:14:18,176
That's why l wanted to see you.

1736
02:14:19,084 --> 02:14:20,415
Am l disturbing you?

1737
02:14:21,219 --> 02:14:23,687
Sir, what is this?
Nothing like that.

1738
02:14:23,989 --> 02:14:25,115
You tell me sir.

1739
02:14:27,159 --> 02:14:30,788
l thought that you would ask about Meera
when you come here.

1740
02:14:32,330 --> 02:14:33,797
But you didn't ask anything.

1741
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:38,269
Sorry! l forgot that.

1742
02:14:39,271 --> 02:14:41,831
How is Meera? ls she in London?

1743
02:14:41,940 --> 02:14:43,908
Or has she come here?

1744
02:14:44,309 --> 02:14:46,436
Meera is here only.

1745
02:14:47,546 --> 02:14:48,672
ls she here?

1746
02:14:49,448 --> 02:14:51,882
Then why didn't she come out?

1747
02:15:25,217 --> 02:15:26,479
When did you come from London?

1748
02:15:26,852 --> 02:15:28,513
Have your husband and children come?

1749
02:15:28,687 --> 02:15:30,848
Where are they? Are they here?

1750
02:15:35,961 --> 02:15:37,861
Meera didn't marry anyone.

1751
02:15:39,297 --> 02:15:42,130
Why didn't marry? Why?

1752
02:15:49,674 --> 02:15:51,665
l have told otten to my wife.

1753
02:15:52,244 --> 02:15:56,840
He'll be a lucky man
who is going to marry Meera.

1754
02:15:59,251 --> 02:16:03,517
l couldn't find that lucky man.

1755
02:16:03,889 --> 02:16:05,356
She found out.

1756
02:16:06,992 --> 02:16:10,223
But l don't know to unite them.

1757
02:16:14,232 --> 02:16:15,199
What is this Meera?

1758
02:16:15,934 --> 02:16:20,166
l didn't think that l'll be
seeing you in this situation.

1759
02:16:20,939 --> 02:16:23,237
They said you brought your son with me.

1760
02:16:23,575 --> 02:16:26,043
Where is he? l haven't seen him.

1761
02:16:41,660 --> 02:16:43,218
Do you know who is she?

1762
02:16:44,596 --> 02:16:46,757
She is Meera aunty.

1763
02:17:02,647 --> 02:17:03,739
Poor Meera!

1764
02:17:03,915 --> 02:17:07,146
She didn't expect this situation..

1765
02:17:07,319 --> 02:17:10,083
..when she sent your dad to lie them.

1766
02:17:10,222 --> 02:17:12,918
Dad please.. lt is true
what he is telling to me.

1767
02:17:13,124 --> 02:17:15,149
Please leave him.

1768
02:17:15,360 --> 02:17:17,453
-Ok, you go.
-Dad!

1769
02:17:18,330 --> 02:17:19,160
You can go.

1770
02:17:20,332 --> 02:17:22,163
He said lie. Don't believe him.

1771
02:17:22,267 --> 02:17:23,928
l'll find out who is telling lie.

1772
02:17:24,069 --> 02:17:25,627
-Palani
-Sir!

1773
02:17:25,971 --> 02:17:27,029
You follow him.

1774
02:17:27,272 --> 02:17:29,502
You leave him when a
girl is there as he told in the train.

1775
02:17:29,674 --> 02:17:31,699
-Blse you kill him.
-Ok sir.

1776
02:17:39,551 --> 02:17:40,483
Come.

1777
02:17:42,520 --> 02:17:43,612
How did he know?

1778
02:17:43,755 --> 02:17:46,280
All are asking me.
But l said no.

1779
02:17:46,391 --> 02:17:47,858
That is good. Come with me.

1780
02:17:48,293 --> 02:17:49,851
You have to do one more help for me.

1781
02:17:50,161 --> 02:17:51,788
You go to station and meet Bhoomi.

1782
02:17:52,063 --> 02:17:53,462
-Me?
-Yes!

1783
02:17:53,665 --> 02:17:55,292
Dad has sent the men to the station.

1784
02:17:55,500 --> 02:17:58,060
He told to kill him
if his lover is not there.

1785
02:17:58,169 --> 02:17:59,033
Oh God!

1786
02:17:59,170 --> 02:18:00,262
That's why l am asking you to go.

1787
02:18:00,605 --> 02:18:02,505
Bhoomi has to know all truth now.

1788
02:18:02,741 --> 02:18:05,005
Tell him that l have only
spoken in the phone.

1789
02:18:06,111 --> 02:18:08,671
But you have to tell him
that he shouldn't fight for me..

1790
02:18:08,947 --> 02:18:12,474
..and l would be waiting
for him life long.

1791
02:18:15,787 --> 02:18:17,812
Will he believe me if l tell him all this?

1792
02:18:18,523 --> 02:18:19,683
We have no way.

1793
02:18:19,891 --> 02:18:21,859
He doesn't have phone to call.

1794
02:18:23,194 --> 02:18:24,183
Blse you do one thing.

1795
02:18:24,496 --> 02:18:25,622
You go there and call me.

1796
02:18:26,364 --> 02:18:27,854
l will tell everything to him.

1797
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:30,661
Go. Go quickly without knowing to anyone.

1798
02:18:36,041 --> 02:18:38,373
There is no train atter this.
This is the last train.

1799
02:19:04,135 --> 02:19:04,999
Come.

1800
02:19:15,313 --> 02:19:16,541
Come.

1801
02:19:56,888 --> 02:19:57,946
ls it you?

1802
02:20:00,625 --> 02:20:02,684
You could have told me!

1803
02:20:05,363 --> 02:20:06,887
Bhoomi, l am..

1804
02:20:27,819 --> 02:20:30,185
Yes sir! lt is true what he said to me.

1805
02:20:30,355 --> 02:20:31,913
A girl is with him.

1806
02:21:12,397 --> 02:21:17,232
l have betrayed Meera
which a friend won't do ever.

1807
02:21:17,402 --> 02:21:18,266
Not only me.

1808
02:21:18,369 --> 02:21:23,568
Who will miss such an
opportunity to marry him?

1809
02:21:23,741 --> 02:21:29,441
That's why l brought
your dad so far away.

1810
02:21:29,647 --> 02:21:33,777
God has given the punishment
because l did this betrayal.

1811
02:21:34,252 --> 02:21:40,418
l am not lucky to live with him
who has achieved everything. lsn't it?

1812
02:21:41,593 --> 02:21:45,552
You will get this diary
long atter my death.

1813
02:21:45,830 --> 02:21:48,424
You should destroy it
without anyone knowing it.

1814
02:21:49,701 --> 02:21:57,540
Because your dad shouldn't
know this truth ever.

1815
02:22:07,919 --> 02:22:12,083
-Why? Didn't you sleep?
-l didn't get any sleep.

1816
02:22:13,424 --> 02:22:16,689
-Siddarth, are you crying?
-No.

1817
02:22:17,529 --> 02:22:20,225
Don't lie. Your dad wouldn't lie.

1818
02:22:20,331 --> 02:22:22,026
Then his son also shouldn't lie.

1819
02:22:23,468 --> 02:22:24,366
Why did you cry?

1820
02:22:25,670 --> 02:22:27,501
l remembered my mother.

1821
02:22:30,742 --> 02:22:34,576
Sleep. l will be with you
till you sleep.

1822
02:22:44,255 --> 02:22:47,656
Aunty, are you angry with my mom?

1823
02:22:49,294 --> 02:22:51,626
Angry? For what?

1824
02:22:53,565 --> 02:22:54,827
l am not angry with your mom.

1825
02:22:55,833 --> 02:22:57,164
l felt very sad.

1826
02:22:58,069 --> 02:23:03,302
Your mom didn't say to meet me
before her death.

1827
02:23:03,875 --> 02:23:05,968
That's why l felt very sad.

1828
02:23:06,611 --> 02:23:09,603
You should forgive my mom.

1829
02:23:19,190 --> 02:23:25,288
l am alive to see you and your son
and ask pardon to you.

1830
02:23:25,463 --> 02:23:27,226
Sir, don't say like that.

1831
02:23:27,532 --> 02:23:31,628
You will be very healthy
when l come next time.

1832
02:23:33,404 --> 02:23:35,429
Then, l take leave.

1833
02:23:39,911 --> 02:23:42,141
Say bye to her.

1834
02:23:51,189 --> 02:23:54,283
When will you come to see me again?

1835
02:23:54,392 --> 02:23:58,351
Shall l call you as mom?

1836
02:24:04,268 --> 02:24:06,498
Ok, you can call me.

1837
02:24:06,604 --> 02:24:10,836
Then, will you come
with me as my mom?

1838
02:24:19,817 --> 02:24:22,047
Siddarth, what are you talking?

1839
02:24:22,353 --> 02:24:23,251
Say sorry to her.

1840
02:24:23,755 --> 02:24:25,245
l am telling you.
Say sorry to her.

1841
02:24:25,356 --> 02:24:26,323
l won't.

1842
02:24:37,635 --> 02:24:38,602
Sorry sir.

1843
02:24:39,103 --> 02:24:42,334
He didn't misbehave like that before.

1844
02:24:42,640 --> 02:24:44,733
l don't know what happened to him.

1845
02:24:45,643 --> 02:24:46,871
Don't mistake me.

1846
02:24:47,845 --> 02:24:50,405
There is nothing wrong
in the child's mind.

1847
02:24:50,715 --> 02:24:55,015
You are also innocent.
But in our mind..

1848
02:25:00,124 --> 02:25:02,490
Siddarth asked her
what l watned to ask.

1849
02:25:04,395 --> 02:25:07,159
l want to see my daughter to live happily.

1850
02:25:10,401 --> 02:25:11,698
Will you take her with you?

1851
02:25:16,474 --> 02:25:19,238
Sir, what are you saying?

1852
02:25:19,744 --> 02:25:24,443
Sir, l haven't thought
about Meera like that.

1853
02:25:26,684 --> 02:25:31,451
l'll obey you.
But this is..

1854
02:25:36,694 --> 02:25:40,994
Meera, what he told me..

1855
02:25:41,833 --> 02:25:44,859
How can l...?

1856
02:25:48,639 --> 02:25:50,470
All these things in my life..

1857
02:25:54,045 --> 02:25:59,677
Do you agree to come with me?

1858
02:26:07,592 --> 02:26:09,287
Ok, l take leave.

1859
02:26:30,748 --> 02:26:32,375
-Where is Siddarth?
-He didn't come inside.

1860
02:26:32,483 --> 02:26:33,916
He was standing with you outside.

1861
02:26:39,357 --> 02:26:41,518
Your attention please..

1862
02:26:52,436 --> 02:26:53,460
Where did you go?

1863
02:26:53,771 --> 02:26:55,136
l went to the toilet.

1864
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:57,467
Toilet is available
in the train, isn't it?

1865
02:26:57,975 --> 02:26:58,873
Take him.

1866
02:27:06,017 --> 02:27:07,780
Where did you go?
Come

1867
02:27:14,358 --> 02:27:15,325
Bye.

1868
02:27:51,762 --> 02:27:52,854
To my dear son Siddarth..
