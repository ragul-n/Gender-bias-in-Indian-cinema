00:01:03,143 --> 00:01:10,015
Visakhapatnam
Rainy season...

00:01:10,183 --> 00:01:16,019

Excuse me, please write it for me.

Your account number?

9
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:45,715
For 2% extra interest,
people are queuing up to deposit money.

10
00:01:45,886 --> 00:01:49,378
Are you here for a coffee?
- No, to invest.

11
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:51,046
How much are you depositing?

12
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:52,213
For son's studies?

13
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:54,883
Son will not get even if deposit,
daughter will get even if l don't.

14
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:56,392
That's why for her marriage.

15
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:03,365
What's the collection?

16
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,372
What's the celebration for?

17
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:13,205
With your Rs.5 lakhs,
our deposit has touched Rs.1500 crores.

18
00:02:13,413 --> 00:02:16,905
Will l get any gift?
- We'll give receipt.- Receipt?

19
00:02:19,419 --> 00:02:21,580
Call chairman.

20
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:23,916
How many times do l've to tell
l don't get proper signal here?

21
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,751
Varadarajulu sir,
l'm Srinivasa Rao here.

22
00:02:28,929 --> 00:02:32,888
From Parvathipuram to Visakhapatnam,
23 branches together in 40 days,

23
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,897
we've collected Rs.1500 crores.

24
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:37,400
This is s record, sir.
- Good.

25
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:49,946
Won't Rs.1500 crores be of this high?

26
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:54,450
Road curves a little between
Rishikonda to Bhimli,

27
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:55,952
like a girl's waist,

28
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:59,785
we've a 10 acre bit of land
exactly there, Bittu.

29
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:04,761
lf we sit there,
entire Vizag will be under our feet.

30
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,422
l used to sit there as a kid.

31
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:11,798
l've heard there one such bit of
land exactly like that in Hyderabad.

32
00:03:11,938 --> 00:03:14,270
l want to sit there!

33
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:16,272
To do that we must have power.

34
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:19,434
True!

35
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:24,378
To get power we must have at least 1000!
Get it.

36
00:03:27,654 --> 00:03:30,487
ls 1000 enough?
We take the risk to steal it.

37
00:03:30,657 --> 00:03:33,649
Should we take 500 after
giving you 1000?

38
00:03:34,995 --> 00:03:38,294
Your younger brother is
young and energetic.

39
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:41,965
Your brother would take risk and steal it.

40
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,966
Who would send him to foreign?

41
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:50,671
Travel Murthy!
No:1 travel agent in lndia.

42
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:53,176
He'll arrange your visas and passports.

43
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:55,679
He'll help you get out of lndia
in 24 hours.

44
00:03:55,849 --> 00:04:00,513
He'll deposit Rs.500 crores in
offshore account in 48 hours.

45
00:04:00,687 --> 00:04:01,745
ls it enough?

46
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:04,088
1000 is correct, right?

47
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:11,028
Lala, if you say car people only see
tyres, brakes, sheets, and steering.

48
00:04:11,164 --> 00:04:13,325
The most important thing is petrol.

49
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,867
lt is not seen to the eye.
Car won't move without it.

50
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:18,334
l'm petrol.

51
00:04:22,175 --> 00:04:24,336
Never do for free the job
you know well.

52
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:27,771
Never try what you don't know.

53
00:04:29,215 --> 00:04:33,447
We're experts in opening lockers.
Let's take money and do it.

54
00:04:35,555 --> 00:04:39,047
His job is to keep us away
from going to jail.

55
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,549
When do you want it?

56
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:43,889
Today is Friday,

57
00:04:44,197 --> 00:04:47,530
cash will reach Reserve Bank
by Monday morning.

58
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:49,361
Better to bring it by Sunday night.

59
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:51,197
ls it a problem if l get it tonight?

60
00:04:51,371 --> 00:04:52,531
ls this time enough for you?

61
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:56,197
Earning may take time but
stealing won't take much time.

62
00:04:58,244 --> 00:04:58,903
What?

63
00:04:59,913 --> 00:05:01,744
Today is Friday.

64
00:05:01,915 --> 00:05:06,079
Cash will reach Reserve Bank
by Monday morning.

65
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:22,763
Select 8 people.

66
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:26,565
They must not know each other.

67
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:31,767
Nobody must know you're the kingpin.

68
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:36,776
l want 8 young men,
they mustn't know each other.

69
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,283
Nobody must know l'm the kingpin.

70
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:44,116
Not a note must be in the bank
tomorrow other than change, Lala.

71
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,121
l think security will be heavy, brother.

72
00:05:48,795 --> 00:05:52,595
Someone from up above should
come down to stop us!

73
00:06:16,322 --> 00:06:19,814
A train leaving the platform
at 60 miles per hour,

74
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:24,157
how fast should a 50 kg man
run to catch it?

75
00:06:24,964 --> 00:06:26,955
Why are you laughing?
- Nothing, father.

76
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,296
ls it ajoke?
- The math is wrong.

77
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,463
What's that? Wrong?
What is it?

78
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:37,633
Train will stop in platform
at that speed.

79
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:41,507
Forget about school children
even Superman can't catch it.

80
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:42,670
He'll fall down.

81
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:46,179
Don't tell such wrong examples,
children would die, father.

82
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:50,352
Then, tell me what is
right calculation?

83
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:58,657
A 50 kg man is waiting in traffic
signal in a crore worth BMW car,

84
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:00,163
how much time would that train
take to cross the crossing?

85
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:03,859
Ask them like that, they'll have
some hope of future, father.

86
00:07:04,037 --> 00:07:07,029
Train from childhood,
won't you let us get into cars?

87
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:09,664
Be rich at least in thoughts,
it's free, right father?

88
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:12,872
Find an answer to the
question by tomorrow.

89
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:15,207
The question asked by brother?
- No, my question.

90
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,372
lf we run, we may fall under the train.

91
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,041
lf you fall die,
but find an answer from your dad.

92
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,381
Go home now, move!

93
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:23,544
You should've seen his face.

94
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:25,884
Why are you mother and
son laughing so much?

95
00:07:26,059 --> 00:07:28,050
Why did you ask him and got insulted?
Then shouting at us!

96
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:30,219
Feed him like a bull!

97
00:07:30,396 --> 00:07:32,023
Mother, l want another dosa.
- Okay.

98
00:07:32,198 --> 00:07:34,359
Not just one, eat 10 and
build your body like a wrestler.

99
00:07:34,534 --> 00:07:36,900
Look at his biceps,
looks like a stone crusher.

100
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:41,063
To show that he roams around
in vest to impress my friends.

101
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,902
Great friends!

102
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:46,534
You wear shirt in home also,
evil eyes!

103
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,074
Not a hope of coming good in life.

104
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:51,581
Sleeping late night and
waking up at 10 am next morning.

105
00:07:51,751 --> 00:07:53,912
He'll come good if he wakes up early.

106
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:56,419
Hen too wakes up early morning,
what's the use?

107
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,921
People are eating it!
- What's your idea then?

108
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:01,583
l don't want a middle class
life like yours.

109
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:04,252
One shot and life must get settled.

110
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:08,925
l can't rush to bargain sales
in super market and cinema theatres.

111
00:08:09,068 --> 00:08:11,229
lf l go to watch a film,
entire row must be empty.

112
00:08:11,404 --> 00:08:15,932
Then become a goon, not just
a row entire theatre would be empty.

113
00:08:16,109 --> 00:08:17,576
ls it so easy to make money?

114
00:08:17,744 --> 00:08:19,939
lt's not a big deal to make money...

115
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:23,446
Who is it?
- Chiranjeevi in film 'Challenge', father.

116
00:08:23,616 --> 00:08:25,777
Reduce the volume.
- Hit film!

117
00:08:25,952 --> 00:08:28,443
Making money isn't making few bucks,

118
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,612
l'll earn Rs.50 lakhs in 5 years,

119
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,121
l don't have that much patience.

120
00:08:32,292 --> 00:08:36,456
Give me Rs.10000, in two hours
l'll make it Rs.1 lakh.

121
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:40,929
ln two hours?
That's my four months' salary!

122
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,434
lt'll take 120 days.
Can you make it 120 minutes?

123
00:08:47,607 --> 00:08:50,474
He'll do it.
- He's too smart!

124
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,134
Rs.10000.

125
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:53,973
You don't give me Rs.100 too.

126
00:08:54,147 --> 00:08:58,140
You keep quiet.
He's asking to earn
not to spend like you.

127
00:09:05,158 --> 00:09:07,149
Hi aunts! What are you doing in rain?

128
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:10,660
Nothing, just testing the new
umbrella if it is working or not.

129
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,694
Someone is going to lose Rs.1 lakh!

130
00:09:14,467 --> 00:09:16,458
Hey Suri! Why haven't you yet come?

131
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,627
You go, l'll join you.
- Cut it.

132
00:09:20,173 --> 00:09:23,506
Listen to the second part
of story 'Bhairava Kona'.

133
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:26,009
Story till now, after fighting father...

134
00:09:26,179 --> 00:09:29,171
l need to go urgently,
can you please give me lift?

135
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:32,182
...he meets a wizard on the way...

136
00:09:32,352 --> 00:09:36,345
Wizard told him about
the treasure in the pond.

137
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:42,358
Prince and Wizard together went in
the same direction for the treasure.

138
00:09:42,528 --> 00:09:44,996
Listen now, 'Bhairava Kona'...

139
00:09:45,164 --> 00:09:48,031
Do you also play?
- Where are you going?

140
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,328
Ecstasy pub.
- Party?

141
00:09:50,503 --> 00:09:54,837
No money to party or
status to throw party, sir.- Then?

142
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:57,840
lPL season, a small betting.

143
00:10:00,213 --> 00:10:02,204
Are they betting so much in Vizag?

144
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:04,043
What are you saying sir?

145
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:09,052
This one night money at stake in Ecstasy
pub in East Vizag equals state budget.

146
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:10,382
Don't police know it?

147
00:10:10,556 --> 00:10:13,548
lf they know, they'd be there only,
don't bother even if banks are looted.

148
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:19,360
Always playing Radio Mirchi!

149
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:24,434
My wish, l'll listen that only.
- Stop here please.

150
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,071
Be careful with money,
someone may steal from you.

151
00:10:29,242 --> 00:10:31,403
l'm smart,
nobody can steal it from me.

152
00:10:31,577 --> 00:10:33,408
No smart man would claim it.

153
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:41,418
We must, even cigarette packs
have statutory warning.

154
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:45,421
Stay away from me, dare touch me,
you'd die, l must announce, right?

155
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:57,259
To do all the colours,
it'll take minimum a week.

156
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,734
He did in 5 minutes.

157
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:08,602
Why are you late?

158
00:11:08,781 --> 00:11:11,614
Suri didn't come,
l had to wait for him.

159
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:12,773
What's the situation?

160
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,947
Oh! How much did Chennai score?

161
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,289
ls Dhoni still playing or out?

162
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,792
He's still there,
45 runs in 20 balls.
- Then okay!

163
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:25,430
What's the betting rate?
- 10:12 going on!

164
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:29,432
Tell me clearly,
l've challenged my father.

165
00:11:30,603 --> 00:11:34,767
Very simple matter,
if Dhoni hits, we'll get a lakh.

166
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:36,602
lf he misses, we'll lose Rs.12000!

167
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:39,142
l've Rs.10000.
- l'll adjust Rs.2000.

168
00:11:39,312 --> 00:11:41,974
Take down Rs.1 lakh betting
at 12 paise on CSK.

169
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:45,807
Who do you think would win today, sir?

170
00:11:48,321 --> 00:11:49,982
lf everything l wish comes true,

171
00:11:50,156 --> 00:11:54,490
l would wish to beocme the CM,
why would l wish others to win?

172
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,991
Mind your work.

173
00:11:56,329 --> 00:11:57,159
What happened to him?

174
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,798
Dhoni hit a four when he was
in that position,

175
00:11:59,966 --> 00:12:01,797
for sentiment we made
him sit like that.

176
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:06,468
Dhoni hit a six!

177
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,869
l've had 12, am l shouting?

178
00:12:16,015 --> 00:12:18,347
Keep ready my one lakh!

179
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:20,179
Bloody, he won!

180
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,327
How many fingers are these?

181
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:38,197
Are you so drunk unable to
see your own fingers, sir?

182
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:41,663
Why are you beating, sir?
l've license to run a bar.

183
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:44,207
They've money, they're drinking.
What's your problem?

184
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:49,542
l've information.
They bribed! l got irritated!

185
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:54,717
Sir, l'm there.

186
00:12:54,887 --> 00:12:57,378
Third building,
second left from main road!

187
00:12:57,557 --> 00:12:59,388
lt's Ecstasy Pub sir.

188
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,892
Sir, it seems if we raid the place
we'll get money equal to state budget.

189
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:07,192
Take other staff also,
you've lD Party Madhu,

190
00:13:07,366 --> 00:13:09,027
by then tell them to get the address.

191
00:13:11,037 --> 00:13:14,404
Why are you laughing?
What's so funny about it?

192
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:22,571
l didn't know l speak funny
till you laughed at me.

193
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,247
The address you said just now,

194
00:13:28,087 --> 00:13:30,248
exactly an hour earlier l told a man.

195
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:38,057
Betting in East Vizag,
money equaling state's budget.

196
00:13:38,231 --> 00:13:39,892
l laughed hearing my own words.

197
00:13:40,066 --> 00:13:43,263
You mean the man who gave us
information is a criminal?- Definitely!

198
00:13:43,402 --> 00:13:45,267
Can't he be a responsible citizen?

199
00:13:45,438 --> 00:13:48,271
Had he been,
he would've told name and number.

200
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:56,108
Okay agreed he may commit crime,
what could it be?

201
00:13:56,282 --> 00:14:01,777
Good number are here and
half of them are in East Vizag,

202
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:09,118
what better time one would get to
loot the bank near control room, sir?

203
00:14:12,765 --> 00:14:14,926
How can you be so sure they're robbers?

204
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:17,592
Where would a group of people
go in such heavy rain?

205
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:21,102
Marriage? lt's not marriage season.

206
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,639
Going out? No luggage.

207
00:14:23,809 --> 00:14:25,640
Monkey caps to mask faces,

208
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,303
cutters to cut open fencing wires.

209
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,648
tool box to open lockers,

210
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:38,150
most important factor in all
the people was fear in eyes.

211
00:14:39,825 --> 00:14:41,486
Not a man was smiling!

212
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:46,287
Man is like that only when he's about
to do something good or bad thing.

213
00:14:47,466 --> 00:14:48,956
Why should l trust you?

214
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:51,501
Not just you, nobody trusts logic.

215
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:52,968
Everyone want magic!

216
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,131
That's why God men are more famous
here than scientists.

217
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:10,353
Behind VClB Bank...

218
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:24,662
Who are you?

219
00:15:24,837 --> 00:15:26,065
Do you've match box?

220
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,552
How many in the group?
- About 10!

221
00:15:47,727 --> 00:15:49,888
l think we've many to share.

222
00:15:50,062 --> 00:15:52,860
That's why l was ordered to dump you
after cutting the wire.

223
00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:54,688
Who is there?

224
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:20,982
We can't open this locker!

225
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:25,479
We can!
lf we've the keys!

226
00:17:26,992 --> 00:17:29,324
l think staff is still there
inside the strong room.

227
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:31,289
They may have the keys.

228
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:52,071
Who killed them? ls it you?

229
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:54,736
Tell me!
- Don't shout!

230
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,737
They'd get scared!

231
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:06,585
lf you don't open the door,
my boys would knock the door of your home.

232
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,421
Will you open the door or
want your wife to open the door?

233
00:19:18,604 --> 00:19:19,764
Open the locker!

234
00:19:43,796 --> 00:19:46,264
Have you killed them?
ls everyone dead?

235
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:47,592
Who planned this?

236
00:19:47,766 --> 00:19:50,428
Ten entered the fence
but only two are remaining.

237
00:19:51,437 --> 00:19:54,429
Finally only one would go out.
Will you kill me also?

238
00:19:55,808 --> 00:19:57,435
l'll kill the crane driver.

239
00:20:37,683 --> 00:20:38,513
Stop sir...no sir.

240
00:20:39,852 --> 00:20:42,514
We'll not get anything in that car.

241
00:20:44,523 --> 00:20:46,684
They're purposefully using light to go.

242
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:50,086
Couldn't they escape in darkness?

243
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:56,995
Crane wires are still moving.
lt had lifted money, right?

244
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:06,205
Engine is still hot,
it broke open the wall, right?

245
00:21:09,548 --> 00:21:11,379
Heavy laden vehicle went this way.

246
00:21:14,553 --> 00:21:15,713
Heavy cash!

247
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:17,886
Money...

248
00:21:32,204 --> 00:21:32,898
Brother!

249
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:34,369
Police are after you.

250
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:39,810
A little further up, there's a
dumping yard, park vehicle there.

251
00:21:43,248 --> 00:21:48,914
Greater Visakha Municipal Corporation
Dumping Yard...Time Midnight...

252
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:50,419
Nobody would suspect money
will be in trash.

253
00:21:50,589 --> 00:22:00,897
Even if they can't stand the stench.

254
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,192
My vehicle is damaged,
come immediately to VClB left.

255
00:22:30,963 --> 00:22:32,260
Brother, police are here.

256
00:22:32,431 --> 00:22:37,425
l'll call Varadarajulu, ensure
nobody sees the money at any cost.

257
00:22:37,603 --> 00:22:39,264
lf necessary, kill them.

258
00:22:39,438 --> 00:22:42,134
You be careful, l'm coming there.

259
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:53,144
Who are you?

260
00:22:56,155 --> 00:22:58,316
Kill him or else he may kill me!

261
00:23:03,829 --> 00:23:06,855
Try to live for a minute,
l'll kill him in 2 minutes

262
00:23:27,186 --> 00:23:32,852
Archer without thumb and gunman
without pointing finger are useless.

263
00:23:50,042 --> 00:23:52,875
Brother!

264
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,857
Shift the body to hospital.

265
00:24:15,033 --> 00:24:16,364
Sir, money is somewhere here only.

266
00:24:16,535 --> 00:24:17,900
He'll tell if we thrash him.

267
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,367
lt's better to confiscate
the cash now, sir.

268
00:24:19,538 --> 00:24:22,701
Leave the place now, Ravi.
You'll get into legal troubles.

269
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:24,068
Just once...

270
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,740
Have Ravi dropped a home.

271
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:50,224
Don't know how many murders
he has committed?

272
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:52,233
They've brought him in fourjeeps.

273
00:24:53,105 --> 00:24:55,938
One getting down from police jeep
isn't a criminal always.

274
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:57,575
One can be a VlP too!

275
00:24:57,743 --> 00:25:02,271
You're very intelligence,
can't you listen to elders advice?

276
00:25:02,447 --> 00:25:03,607
You'd come good in life.

277
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:06,444
Why anyone else?
l'll listen to you.

278
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:08,449
Can you get me the post of
Prime Minister by morning?

279
00:25:09,788 --> 00:25:12,780
He's killing with words,
where was he born?

280
00:25:30,776 --> 00:25:34,303
What bothers you
wherever l may be born, bro...

281
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:37,971
What bothers you
however l may look, bro...

282
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,642
What bothers you
whatever l may do, bro...

283
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,651
Don't irritate me, bro!

284
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:47,155
What bothers yo
if l smoke, bro...

285
00:25:47,326 --> 00:25:50,818
What bothers you
if l play drums, bro...

286
00:25:50,996 --> 00:25:54,454
What bothers you
if l wink at girls, bro...

287
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,294
lf l hit your teeth
would spill like beans...

288
00:25:56,468 --> 00:25:58,459
How many buttons does my shirt has...

289
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:00,002
How many preventive vaccines
have l taken...

290
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:01,799
How many holes do
my pair ofjeans has...

291
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,634
How many zeroes do
my cell phone number has...

292
00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:05,640
How much loans my dad
owes to other...

293
00:26:05,811 --> 00:26:07,506
How many rakhis does
my sister has...

294
00:26:07,646 --> 00:26:11,173
Stop asking such crazy questions...

295
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:15,184
l'm a purebred loafer
what bothers you, bro...

296
00:26:16,355 --> 00:26:18,346
l'm a loafer...

297
00:26:53,892 --> 00:26:57,055
Don't know whose photo is
behind the poster...

298
00:26:57,229 --> 00:27:00,687
Don't know what wound is
behind the plaster...

299
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,527
Don't know which sixer
is behind which ball...

300
00:27:02,701 --> 00:27:04,362
You can see only after it is hit!

301
00:27:04,536 --> 00:27:07,869
Don't know what product
is behind the label...

302
00:27:08,073 --> 00:27:11,406
Don't know which table
has a drawer...

303
00:27:11,576 --> 00:27:15,068
Without touching or laying your
hand, how can you say it...

304
00:27:15,247 --> 00:27:16,908
All that is white isn't biesting milk...

305
00:27:17,082 --> 00:27:18,572
All that is black isn't soil...

306
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,411
All that glitters isn't gold...

307
00:27:20,585 --> 00:27:22,075
All that fades isn't old...

308
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:25,417
Don't judge by appearances,
it's wrong, bro...

309
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,754
Stop inquiring about me, bro...

310
00:27:50,782 --> 00:27:53,945
My name is peppermint...
My body is high voltage current...

311
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,453
My shape is trumpet...
My looks are bullets...

312
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:04,623
l'm sweeter than sugar...
Hotter than your liquor...

313
00:28:04,796 --> 00:28:08,926
My face is bed light...
l'll brighten up the night...

314
00:28:12,137 --> 00:28:15,470
The town is in chaos...
Affairs fill the night life...

315
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:18,940
Jigs of love fill darkness...
That's my highlight...

316
00:28:20,645 --> 00:28:22,806
Come loafer...

317
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:26,473
l'll show you bliss...

318
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:41,963
According you l'm useless...
According me l belong to A class...

319
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:45,796
Your worry is yours and my fight is mine...
Why should we clash?

320
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:52,672
l'm a mad man, what do l know?
lt's just time pass for you...

321
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:56,338
You can use a lens to see
my seriousness...

322
00:28:56,681 --> 00:29:00,014
Tendulkar failed 10th class,
didn't he become master of cricket?

323
00:29:00,185 --> 00:29:03,677
Paperboy to Presidency,
didn't we the story of Abdul Kalam?

324
00:29:03,855 --> 00:29:06,688
Whose fate takes to where
nobody knows...

325
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:11,192
You're not competent enough
to decide that, bro...

326
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:36,217
Next day...

327
00:29:42,227 --> 00:29:43,387
This is very hot, guru!

328
00:29:43,562 --> 00:29:47,020
Using helmets or putting seat belts
after seeing a police man,

329
00:29:47,199 --> 00:29:49,531
and if they catch, without
making claims of high connections,

330
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:51,862
and escaping from them...
follow the rules!

331
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,026
So now...

332
00:29:54,706 --> 00:29:55,934
...listen to a song!

333
00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:18,152
Rs.1500 crores are burning to ashes!

334
00:31:18,323 --> 00:31:20,723
l stole it is risking my life.

335
00:31:33,338 --> 00:31:37,798
Ravi! l'll not spare you!

336
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,503
Sir...you?

337
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,180
Bittu has escaped!

338
00:31:49,354 --> 00:31:51,413
He killed Prabhu and 3 constables.

339
00:31:52,691 --> 00:31:55,091
You're the next target!

340
00:32:02,167 --> 00:32:05,830
To protect witnesses from criminals,

341
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:07,665
we change their names and
send them to new places.

342
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,364
We call it as witness
re-location program.

343
00:32:10,542 --> 00:32:12,874
You'll be away from your family
for about 4 or 5 months.

344
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:14,706
As soon as we catch Bittu,
you can come back.

345
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:17,780
You'd say something, right father?
Say it father.

346
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:23,783
l want you to come good in life,
that's why l scolded at you.

347
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,450
Now all l want you is to stay alive.
That's all!

348
00:32:32,397 --> 00:32:34,524
lt's not your father's anger,
he's worried about...

349
00:32:34,699 --> 00:32:38,191
Nothing sir, he's frustrated for
losing Rs.5 lakhs deposited in bank.

350
00:32:38,403 --> 00:32:42,032
l'll talk to him after earning back
those Rs.5 lakhs in these 5 months.

351
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,734
l'll go to some Australia
or Dubai, send me there.

352
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,741
We don't have that much budget,

353
00:32:47,912 --> 00:32:51,905
at the most we can
send you to Hyderabad. - Hyderabad?

354
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,740
To put me in a bus and
send to Hyderabad,

355
00:32:53,918 --> 00:32:57,410
why do you use terms like
re-location program, sir?

356
00:32:57,589 --> 00:33:00,251
A man who can escape from jail
can't he come to Hyderabad?

357
00:33:00,425 --> 00:33:01,585
No...
- l beg you sir.

358
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,251
This will not work out,
l think you'll kill me before Bittu.

359
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:05,896
Do you trust me sir?

360
00:33:06,097 --> 00:33:08,395
l've a program. Let's follow that.
- Okay, come.

361
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:11,729
First time my photo is coming in
newspaper, tell him to take it well.

362
00:33:11,903 --> 00:33:14,235
Why an expression for
an accident photo?

363
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,231
Logic sir, l'll look serious.

364
00:33:18,076 --> 00:33:19,839
Dead man has no expression.

365
00:33:20,945 --> 00:33:23,436
You're right sir, l'll look dead,
tell him to take the snap.

366
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,282
l don't know if children get maths
or not if my father beats them,

367
00:33:28,453 --> 00:33:32,446
but if Bittu hits my father
will tell everything. That's why!

368
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:36,958
But if l'm dead, Bittu would relax
and mind his work.

369
00:33:37,128 --> 00:33:39,926
My batch mate Seetharam is
in Hyderabad. My good friend.

370
00:33:40,098 --> 00:33:41,929
l've told him you're coming
there in search of ajob.

371
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,591
Stay with him but
don't tell about Bittu.

372
00:33:44,769 --> 00:33:46,259
He's a coward!

373
00:33:51,643 --> 00:33:53,474
What happened?

374
00:33:53,645 --> 00:33:57,479
He died before l could kill him.

375
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,155
He's vey lucky.

376
00:34:07,325 --> 00:34:10,817
ACP Seetharam's residence
Banjara Hills, Hyderabad

377
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:19,498
ln all these years of my service
never got an opportunity to use it.

378
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,660
You blessed me like that.

379
00:34:20,805 --> 00:34:23,137
Nothing is impossible for you.

380
00:34:27,512 --> 00:34:29,002
Keep that bell.

381
00:34:30,014 --> 00:34:31,345
How did you know it sir?

382
00:34:31,516 --> 00:34:33,848
lt's a bell, can't you hear
the sound when you walk?

383
00:34:36,354 --> 00:34:38,515
To ring the bell, like this.

384
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,351
lf you want to steal, like this!

385
00:34:40,525 --> 00:34:42,857
Sir, you're a police officer,

386
00:34:43,027 --> 00:34:46,326
had you been a thief
nobody could've caught you. Bye sir.

387
00:34:47,999 --> 00:34:50,524
You said you've to go to station
to pick up someone.

388
00:34:51,336 --> 00:34:54,703
Train arrives at 8.30 am!
Plenty of time.

389
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:56,170
l can have breakfast too by then.

390
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:59,037
Excuse me, where's the common bathroom?
- That side.

391
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:04,375
Who is he?
- Who knows?

392
00:35:14,726 --> 00:35:15,556
Oh no 8.45 am!
l need to go to railway station.

393
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:17,718
No need. l'm coming from there.

394
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:19,355
Yes.

395
00:35:19,697 --> 00:35:20,356
l can see.

396
00:35:20,532 --> 00:35:22,557
l and Rajamanikyam...
- He told me.

397
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,031
This address...
- l found it.

398
00:35:24,202 --> 00:35:26,363
Coffee?
- l'll have it. - Later.

399
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,370
No problem, l'll come.

400
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:32,733
He's Ravi, he looks average.

401
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:34,902
Go inside and talk.
Wire may get snapped.

402
00:35:37,081 --> 00:35:39,242
My eldest daughter.
- Good sir.

403
00:35:39,417 --> 00:35:41,408
l know, don't ogle at her.

404
00:35:41,586 --> 00:35:45,420
l've already fixed her marriage,
bridegroom is a pilot.

405
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:47,915
lf you want go out with him
as much as you want.

406
00:35:49,093 --> 00:35:50,253
She's my wife Lalitha.

407
00:35:50,428 --> 00:35:54,728
One who left angrily is Neha, one who
didn't come out feeling shy is Ooha.

408
00:35:54,899 --> 00:35:55,729
Then what about him?

409
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:59,392
So, yours is Ha family!

410
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:03,396
He's...
- Thief!

411
00:36:03,608 --> 00:36:04,768
How do you know it?
- l can smell him.

412
00:36:04,943 --> 00:36:06,240
He stole my perfume bottle.

413
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:11,604
Sorry, he's an ex-thief.

414
00:36:11,783 --> 00:36:14,946
His specialty is to get
caught in a minute.

415
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:17,451
Snatch chain!

416
00:36:19,457 --> 00:36:22,290
Thief...thief...bloody...
may you lose your hands!

417
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,451
Sorry, your chain got stuck in my hand.

418
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:28,327
Steal money!

419
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:32,099
Hey oldie! What's that look?

420
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,261
Keep the bag down!

421
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:36,967
Open the zip, you fool!

422
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,983
Nobody offered him ajob,
so l had to keep him here.

423
00:36:57,495 --> 00:36:58,325
Who is she?

424
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:00,464
l told you she's my youngest daughter.

425
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:01,954
What's her age?

426
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,666
Were you still working then?

427
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:08,305
What are you saying before women?

428
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:10,134
Why is entire family
in hall, brother-in-law?

429
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:14,167
Bedroom is not empty.
- Cool, brother-in-law.

430
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:17,839
How many times l've told you
not to bring criminals to home?

431
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:21,349
My jeep broke down on the way to station,
l thought you'd give me lift.

432
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:22,679
Are you going fine, brother?

433
00:37:22,854 --> 00:37:25,015
Would you like to have coffee?
- Get him a biryani too.

434
00:37:25,189 --> 00:37:26,850
Don't know who you should
ask for a coffee, go in!!

435
00:37:27,025 --> 00:37:28,515
ls it wrong to ask for coffee too?
- What's the case?

436
00:37:28,693 --> 00:37:30,854
He stole a gold chain
from Commissioner's house.

437
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:33,497
l've tried third degree but he's
refusing to tell where he hid it.

438
00:37:33,665 --> 00:37:35,496
For you too?
- Who is he sir?

439
00:37:36,501 --> 00:37:39,493
He's Valmiki, great Cl!

440
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,169
lnterrogation specialist.

441
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:46,499
He make even dreaded
criminals to cry!

442
00:37:46,711 --> 00:37:49,373
Brother-in-law, no please,
we mustn't praise ourselves.

443
00:37:49,547 --> 00:37:53,881
lf he hasn't told you too means...
- l'm unable to get it.

444
00:37:54,052 --> 00:37:57,886
l used belts, chains, batons,
pins and safety pins too!

445
00:38:05,229 --> 00:38:06,696
Since Commissioner wasn't
paying for the chain,

446
00:38:06,864 --> 00:38:09,526
the jeweller who sold it
asked me to steal it for him.

447
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,802
You'd have tried everything
but not the pin.

448
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:23,245
Please show him flowers and girls!
He's too violent!

449
00:38:36,594 --> 00:38:39,085
Would anyone eat flowers?
- Aren't we eating cauliflower?

450
00:38:43,401 --> 00:38:45,232
You'll become fate if you
eat clarified butter.

451
00:38:45,403 --> 00:38:46,927
Was my mother fat?

452
00:38:47,238 --> 00:38:50,935
Your aunt loves you so much
as her own daughter.

453
00:38:54,946 --> 00:38:56,277
Lifebouy!

454
00:38:56,447 --> 00:38:59,610
Neither l've a life nor
my life has a boy!

455
00:39:04,122 --> 00:39:08,115
Why are you still standing
behind the curtain? Come out!

456
00:39:08,292 --> 00:39:10,123
l'm standing outside, father.

457
00:39:16,434 --> 00:39:18,868
Be careful dear, there are
many colleges in this route.

458
00:39:19,437 --> 00:39:23,271
Who would look at me, father?
- There will be some mad man!

459
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,641
Where uncle?
- Cricket betting takes place near by...

460
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:32,646
Betting?

461
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:34,978
Come uncle, need Rs.5 lakhs urgently.
- Rs.5 lakhs?

462
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:37,815
Don't worry about amount,
l've good experience in this.

463
00:39:37,989 --> 00:39:40,651
With such idea only Singapore
Lakshminarayana invested Rs.50000.

464
00:39:40,825 --> 00:39:41,655
Didn't he get money?

465
00:39:41,826 --> 00:39:44,317
Why not? He got money
and l got experience.

466
00:40:05,183 --> 00:40:06,514
What a figure!

467
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:09,683
What's there?

468
00:40:10,188 --> 00:40:12,349
Wind must blow if you want to see her.

469
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:14,582
Whether wind blows or cyclone hits,
it remains the same.

470
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:18,852
Did you see?
lt twinkled when she smiled!

471
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,657
Lightning? lt'll rain too!

472
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,493
l want to go to her once, uncle.

473
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,567
No need, she'll come if we call her.

474
00:40:37,715 --> 00:40:38,943
You are...?

475
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:58,032
Just a while ago there was
a twinkle when you smiled.

476
00:40:58,202 --> 00:40:59,897
May be because of this.

477
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:02,365
Come here!

478
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:04,905
Why are her teeth having
a fence like for fields?

479
00:41:05,076 --> 00:41:05,701
lsn't she cute?

480
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,073
He has gone completely blind.
l think l'll go my own.

481
00:41:09,247 --> 00:41:09,906
l got a scapegoat.

482
00:41:10,414 --> 00:41:12,905
How can l reach Koti, sir?
- That side.

483
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:14,240
l don't have work there.

484
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:21,652
l got it.

485
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:32,562
What does your father?

486
00:41:32,737 --> 00:41:34,227
He married second time.

487
00:41:37,408 --> 00:41:39,933
Your mother..?
- She's dead.

488
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:42,344
Sorry...

489
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:47,775
Your step mother...?
- She tortures me. What else?

490
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:50,117
Lousy family!

491
00:41:53,457 --> 00:41:55,118
Shall we've a tea?

492
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:59,627
lt's cool raining,
hot tea would be fine.

493
00:42:01,766 --> 00:42:02,664
lt'll be fine.

494
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:14,768
We can have tea before bus arrives.

495
00:42:16,147 --> 00:42:17,307
Bus has arrived.

496
00:42:23,154 --> 00:42:24,985
You didn't tell me your name...

497
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:50,170
By the way you didn't tell me your name.

498
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,215
O Madhu, my heart isn't
mine anymore...

499
00:43:27,385 --> 00:43:32,379
O Madhu, my heart is
no more with me...

500
00:43:32,556 --> 00:43:37,391
You're spread magic with your eyes
moving like a merry-go-round...

501
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:42,362
With your magnetic beauty
made Hyderabad go after you...

502
00:43:42,533 --> 00:43:47,368
l've left myself and come to you,
anyway my heart won't come back to me...

503
00:43:47,538 --> 00:43:49,369
Even if it comes,
what would l do with it?

504
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:52,566
So, keep it with you,
l don't want it...

505
00:44:22,573 --> 00:44:29,775
Every drop of the rain shows
you like a mirror...

506
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:40,113
When my father shouts at me,
every word hears like your name...

507
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,920
Like a little with two plaits..
Like rainbow sporting different colours...

508
00:44:48,099 --> 00:44:53,196
You look different in different angle and
tempted and killed me like a live wire...

509
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:07,143
Madhu boss...

510
00:45:09,153 --> 00:45:10,142
Madhu friend...

511
00:45:10,988 --> 00:45:12,478
Madhu future...

512
00:45:13,824 --> 00:45:17,157
ls she that beautiful?
- Class sir!

513
00:45:17,328 --> 00:45:18,818
Then, she must be dull.

514
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:20,486
Active girl sir.

515
00:45:22,133 --> 00:45:23,794
Then long skirt and jacket type.

516
00:45:23,968 --> 00:45:25,629
She was wearing churidhar.

517
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,462
Which good looking girl
now wears churidhar?

518
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,666
What are you saying?
Why do you always negative?

519
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:33,970
Can you blabber anything
if you're drunk?

520
00:45:34,178 --> 00:45:36,510
Bloody old generation!

521
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,342
l just asked if she's good looking,
why is he getting irritated?

522
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:43,009
May be she's not that beautiful,
why are inquiring and irritating him?

523
00:45:43,187 --> 00:45:45,678
Yuck! Both father and daughter
don't have any taste.

524
00:45:47,024 --> 00:45:48,685
He's gone, right? Go study!

525
00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:51,191
l'm seeing you here only,
what do you do?

526
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:52,693
What would l do?

527
00:45:52,863 --> 00:45:55,991
No jobs in software and
no growth in hardware.

528
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:59,500
Goons rule real estate,
low salaries in contractions.

529
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:03,197
lf l commit myself in hurry,
l'd be like that in 10 years.

530
00:46:04,375 --> 00:46:06,366
ln 20 years end up like that.

531
00:46:33,537 --> 00:46:35,232
At least before bus arrives...

532
00:46:38,242 --> 00:46:39,869
21C goes to your office, right?

533
00:46:40,044 --> 00:46:41,568
l'm going out for shopping.

534
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:46,739
Can't she invite me?
- Girls will not invite.

535
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:30,693
Your waist is thin like pipe making
other girls jealous of it...

536
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:41,295
Even if Lord Brahma offers personal
apology, l can't forgive him...

537
00:47:43,774 --> 00:47:48,643
Like a moon spilling sandalwood...
Like jasmine spreading numbing fragrance...

538
00:47:48,812 --> 00:47:54,148
You're tempting and killing me
differently at different times...

539
00:48:25,849 --> 00:48:27,009
Why do you think so much for it?

540
00:48:27,184 --> 00:48:29,675
Change the daughter's make up and
say she eloped with neighbour boy.

541
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:31,684
We can stretch it for
another 30 episodes.

542
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:34,180
Daughter's get has changed completely.

543
00:48:38,028 --> 00:48:39,518
How much did you spend on it?

544
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:42,992
Rs.150!

545
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:45,491
How could you spend
Rs.25000 for shopping?- l didn't sir.

546
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:48,661
How did he leave you
without payment?

547
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,000
l'm ACP Seetharam's relative,
you know that?

548
00:48:51,175 --> 00:48:53,006
So, they left you after
taking my name, right?

549
00:48:53,177 --> 00:48:55,372
No.
- Then?

550
00:48:55,546 --> 00:48:57,377
He'll come personally and pay.

551
00:48:57,548 --> 00:49:00,779
So, you've pledged me, right?

552
00:49:11,562 --> 00:49:16,522
Down with Varadarajulu!
- Stop it!

553
00:49:17,868 --> 00:49:19,392
How much did you invest?
- 10!

554
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:20,764
Mine is 50!

555
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:23,096
Would they pay if you shout?

556
00:49:23,574 --> 00:49:25,041
What are you looking at?...

557
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:27,040
Will you beat me?
Come beat me.

558
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:29,910
Not just your 10 but 12 years of...

559
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,071
How could they let Bittu
escape so easily?

560
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:34,740
Have you gone blind?...

561
00:49:34,918 --> 00:49:37,079
What is this? Khaddar!

562
00:49:37,254 --> 00:49:39,085
What's that? Khaki!

563
00:49:39,256 --> 00:49:42,919
Ask him that question!
Come on ask him! Ask him!

564
00:49:43,594 --> 00:49:45,755
Next time they'll strip
your uniform and beat you.

565
00:49:47,731 --> 00:49:49,562
Tell that in Telugu to them!

566
00:49:51,235 --> 00:49:55,228
Bittu's two men broke signals
on the night of robbery,

567
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:57,600
electronic cameras have
taken their pictures,

568
00:50:00,944 --> 00:50:03,936
we've sent those photographs too
to all stations along with Bittu's.

569
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:06,776
Now we're releasing it
to the press also.

570
00:50:20,597 --> 00:50:23,157
lt would be fine if you join me
for the press meet too.

571
00:50:24,268 --> 00:50:26,759
lf you send us out of country,
we'll not come here too.

572
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:30,801
Murthy, send them out immediately.

573
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:33,474
They're coming to guest house
for a group photo session.

574
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:36,306
Making fake passports isn't easy, sir.

575
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,811
They didn't bring the money anyway.

576
00:50:37,981 --> 00:50:41,314
Tell him to send at least his group's
photos, fake names and addresses.

577
00:50:41,485 --> 00:50:44,318
He wants you to submit applications,
who are you sending to him?

578
00:50:52,329 --> 00:50:54,456
Name is Sattar, six feet tall!

579
00:50:54,631 --> 00:50:56,121
How tall would he be sitting?

580
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,791
l know your intelligence,
that's why l sent him your photo.

581
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:02,496
He'll find you, he'll give you
a cover, take it properly.

582
00:51:09,146 --> 00:51:11,011
Sattar is here, get ready.

583
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:46,872
Sattar, don't do anything in haste.

584
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:48,039
Let me go away!

585
00:51:49,553 --> 00:51:51,544
lf not l'll kill this girl.

586
00:51:51,722 --> 00:51:55,055
We're consulting high officials,
they'll be here.

587
00:51:55,225 --> 00:51:58,717
They'll consider your demands.
We need little time.

588
00:51:59,229 --> 00:52:00,059
What's the situation?

589
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:01,857
About 100 students are inside.

590
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:06,866
ls he alive?

591
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:09,361
Luckily, nothing happened!

592
00:52:13,911 --> 00:52:14,741
What happened sir?

593
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:21,907
What happened?
- You shot him down!

594
00:52:23,921 --> 00:52:25,752
l shot him.
- How?

595
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:32,251
Remove your glasses,
can't get your expression.

596
00:52:48,111 --> 00:52:49,601
Do you know shooting?

597
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:51,945
You don't need training for it, sir.

598
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:54,777
All you need is a trigger
and a head to be shot.

599
00:52:54,952 --> 00:52:58,353
There are handcuffs and jails too!

600
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:02,623
To remove bacteria from bathroom,
you've to use acid.

601
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:03,623
You don't use scent.

602
00:53:03,794 --> 00:53:06,786
Why are you discussing with a
criminal threatening to kill children?

603
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:08,591
Why don't you just gun them down?

604
00:53:09,766 --> 00:53:11,757
What's your comment on this incident, sir?

605
00:53:13,437 --> 00:53:18,340
lt was a sudden incident,
nobody could imagine it.

606
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:23,143
ln such situations...
tell them to get his body!

607
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,646
Brother-in-law, tell them
to get the body.- Okay.

608
00:53:25,816 --> 00:53:29,308
What's this like a kid?

609
00:53:29,486 --> 00:53:33,149
You should've seen when he shot him,
my heart froze!

610
00:53:33,323 --> 00:53:35,314
He shot him down suddenly, bloody rogue!

611
00:53:36,827 --> 00:53:41,787
Evening when l dozed off, had a
dream of getting President's medal.

612
00:53:41,965 --> 00:53:44,456
lsn't it good if you get
the President's medal?

613
00:53:44,668 --> 00:53:46,659
But it was you who was accepting it.

614
00:53:56,513 --> 00:53:59,004
Never used the gun in
my 25 years of service.

615
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:01,173
No? l'll make you also use it, sir.

616
00:54:02,185 --> 00:54:03,846
l'll not fire till l'm alive.

617
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:08,522
l'm a Gandhian,
come let's have a drink.

618
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:11,024
Till now you shouted at him and
want him to join for a drink now.

619
00:54:11,194 --> 00:54:13,685
Just because you're scared,
do we stop watching horror films?

620
00:54:13,864 --> 00:54:16,162
That's a bad habit!
He too is one of them.

621
00:54:40,223 --> 00:54:43,386
You made a film and used
my brother-in-law's poster.- Keep quiet.

622
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:47,394
We got his office travel papers
from Sattar's body.

623
00:54:47,531 --> 00:54:50,728
First time in life my brother-in-law
is trying to interrogate him.

624
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:53,529
l don't think he's that successful,
take a look!

625
00:54:53,904 --> 00:54:56,896
lf anyone has my letterhead,
would you call me to the station?

626
00:54:57,074 --> 00:54:59,907
Many hundreds come to my office
seeking passports every day.

627
00:55:00,911 --> 00:55:02,902
lt is you who must find
the criminals among them.

628
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:06,072
You shoot because you've gun and
call here because you've an office.

629
00:55:06,249 --> 00:55:09,082
Do you've sense? Some useless man
is shouting at him, why are you silent?

630
00:55:10,253 --> 00:55:10,912
He got angry, so he's shouting.

631
00:55:11,088 --> 00:55:13,420
l'm frustrated now, can l beat up
that Travel Murthy's man?

632
00:55:13,590 --> 00:55:16,252
You bet him. l'll take care of it.
- Hold this.

633
00:55:26,403 --> 00:55:29,133
Has my table got so many deadly weapons?

634
00:55:31,575 --> 00:55:32,564
What's the trouble here?

635
00:55:32,943 --> 00:55:34,774
What's this?
Why is he beating him?

636
00:55:34,945 --> 00:55:37,106
You don't need reason to beat criminals.

637
00:55:38,448 --> 00:55:41,781
He's my man!
- Who said you're men? Who?

638
00:55:41,952 --> 00:55:42,782
What's this sir?

639
00:55:42,953 --> 00:55:46,116
Frustration sir! lt seems the poor
man lost his bike. He's frustrated!

640
00:55:46,289 --> 00:55:47,278
Can you get back your bike
if you beat him?

641
00:55:47,457 --> 00:55:49,118
He'll get over the frustration, right?

642
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:54,597
What's the trouble?

643
00:55:54,765 --> 00:55:57,791
Frustration sir, lt seems our people
are not taking his complaint.

644
00:55:58,935 --> 00:56:01,802
Please look after it.
- He's beating up my man!

645
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:05,601
Look after that also.
- That's what we're looking at sir!

646
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:07,299
lt seems he's looking at it!

647
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:12,809
l got it sir,
he's beating him up wantonly.

648
00:56:14,317 --> 00:56:16,478
You're supporting him.

649
00:56:17,654 --> 00:56:20,817
Neither it's frustration nor my foot!
- This is realization!

650
00:56:22,325 --> 00:56:24,987
l'll take care of you!

651
00:56:27,964 --> 00:56:32,128
That's it sir! You think l'm a boy
and can't do anything, right?

652
00:56:32,302 --> 00:56:34,998
Can't do anything?
You've almost killed them.

653
00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:39,302
What have you done about
the passports, Murthy?

654
00:56:39,476 --> 00:56:41,842
What can l do sir?
Finding my letterhead with Sattar,

655
00:56:42,012 --> 00:56:43,479
police are turning heat on me.

656
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,240
l can't help you in this matter.
Sorry sir, please leave me.

657
00:56:50,353 --> 00:56:54,687
Somebody is trying to stop me.
Who is he?

658
00:57:00,664 --> 00:57:04,998
He has become a headache to you,
l'm sure he'd be epitome of pain.

659
00:57:05,168 --> 00:57:07,659
Why is his photo here?
- Do you know him?

660
00:57:08,338 --> 00:57:11,330
l came to Hyderabad from Vizag
for helping to arrest him.

661
00:57:14,044 --> 00:57:17,707
ln Rs.1500 crore crime,

662
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:21,544
he's accused number one and
are you the witness number one?

663
00:57:21,718 --> 00:57:24,881
With police vigilance around
going out of lndia...

664
00:57:25,055 --> 00:57:26,886
He mustn't go out of this
country at any cost.

665
00:57:27,057 --> 00:57:30,049
lf l get scared and stop,
l may never escape.

666
00:57:30,227 --> 00:57:31,888
Why are you so stubborn?

667
00:57:32,062 --> 00:57:34,860
lt's stubbornness but ego!

668
00:57:35,031 --> 00:57:36,692
Why do you want to take the risk?

669
00:57:36,867 --> 00:57:38,698
lt's not risk but ego!

670
00:57:38,902 --> 00:57:42,531
He made me to garland my photo
and offer obsequies while l'm alive.

671
00:57:42,706 --> 00:57:46,233
Would l spare him?
l'll surely catch him.

672
00:57:46,409 --> 00:57:48,400
Nobody can catch me.

673
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:52,641
l'll slip out like sand
from a clenching fist!

674
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:59,246
lf l clench my fist, even sand
can't escape and die in my hand.

675
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:00,912
Call Home Minister and tell them
not to touch Travel Murthy.

676
00:58:04,261 --> 00:58:06,923
DGP. tell your boys not
to touch Travel Murthy.

677
00:58:07,097 --> 00:58:09,224
Why are you torturing Murthy?
Leave him. lt's all over!

678
00:58:09,399 --> 00:58:13,392
l'm telling you to drop
the matter here itself. Got it?

679
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:17,733
Our DGP!

680
00:58:17,941 --> 00:58:20,273
Travel Murthy is great man,

681
00:58:20,443 --> 00:58:24,937
if possible felicitate him but
don't call him to station.

682
00:58:25,448 --> 00:58:28,281
lf we get evidence that Murthy
is helping Bittu to get passport,

683
00:58:28,451 --> 00:58:29,941
what can DGP also do?

684
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,612
Morning he'd do Yoga and
evening he'd take a walk.

685
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,782
How can l know what would
he do if get evidence?

686
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,791
ls it so easy to get
evidence against him?

687
00:58:38,962 --> 00:58:41,931
What?
- Madhu works with Murthy's office!

688
00:58:42,098 --> 00:58:44,259
So what?
- lf we hold Madhu keycard,

689
00:58:44,434 --> 00:58:48,598
we can get information of Bittu's
ticket and how it'll hand reach him.

690
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:51,434
lf we get those documents,
we can arrest both of them.

691
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:53,132
Why would she give the key card?

692
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:56,143
Give me two water tanks and a Bluetooth,
in 3 days, she'll do as l say!

693
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:24,167
Neither rain will stop nor bus
would come till we finish the tea.

694
00:59:25,642 --> 00:59:26,165
Stop!

695
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:27,704
Brother-in-law!

696
00:59:30,013 --> 00:59:31,503
Bus has been stopped.

697
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:33,342
We can hold it for 10 minutes only.

698
00:59:33,516 --> 00:59:34,676
Why did you stop the bus sir?

699
00:59:35,185 --> 00:59:37,346
Why?
- For public safety!

700
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,512
All of you please co-operate with us.
Think he's a terrorist.

701
00:59:41,524 --> 00:59:43,355
Just assume!
- Please sit down!

702
00:59:44,194 --> 00:59:47,994
lf anyone talks l'll blow this
bus to smithereens!

703
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:50,155
Throw away your cell phones.

704
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:01,209
Throw means outside not on him!
Will you kill the boy?

705
01:00:01,845 --> 01:00:03,369
lsn't it good if a terrorist dies?

706
01:00:04,881 --> 01:00:08,373
Now he's not a terrorist but a thief!

707
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:14,881
Now he'll burn down the bus
and threaten you with a knife.

708
01:00:15,725 --> 01:00:17,215
What would you do?

709
01:00:22,866 --> 01:00:24,527
What will you do man?

710
01:00:24,701 --> 01:00:26,760
l'll cut his hand and douse the fire.

711
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:32,872
You can blow it like this and
hand him over to police too.

712
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:34,873
You've that option too, you know?
Sit down.

713
01:00:35,879 --> 01:00:40,077
Rain will stop now...stop...
it has stopped!

714
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,410
What about my bus?

715
01:00:45,588 --> 01:00:48,580
Driver, Commissioner's daughter will
board the bus at next stopping.

716
01:00:48,758 --> 01:00:51,921
Doesn't she have a car?
- Gone for repairs.

717
01:00:52,595 --> 01:00:55,723
An officer in red shirt
will help her to board.

718
01:00:55,899 --> 01:00:57,560
Doesn't he have a uniform?

719
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:01,901
Gave it for washing!

720
01:01:02,572 --> 01:01:05,097
Bus must move once he signals.

721
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:10,436
lf people are so violent,
how can the poor criminals live?

722
01:01:10,613 --> 01:01:12,444
l'm also thinking about it.

723
01:01:12,615 --> 01:01:15,607
Look, your bus hasn't come yet.
- Your luck!

724
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:19,111
Do you know what luck is?
Luck is what you wish!

725
01:01:19,289 --> 01:01:20,950
What you desire is future!

726
01:01:21,958 --> 01:01:24,449
Really?
- Why not try it?

727
01:01:25,962 --> 01:01:27,122
Make a wish!

728
01:01:28,932 --> 01:01:30,593
l don't like to go in a bus!

729
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:41,133
Look, bus went away.
That is your power.

730
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:45,141
Power? Do you know how much trouble
we took to stop the bus?

731
01:01:45,315 --> 01:01:46,304
Make another wish!

732
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:50,650
l want to ride on a bike.

733
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:54,312
Bike? ls it chocolate?
How can l get one now?

734
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:58,325
Don't tell him not to
commit on colour.

735
01:01:58,495 --> 01:01:59,325
Keep this.
- Just Rs.10?

736
01:01:59,496 --> 01:02:02,954
No change sir.
- l too don't want change.- No sir...

737
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:05,795
Pay Rs.200 and run over the lemons,
nobody can stop you.

738
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:08,961
lf l pay Rs.20 and stamp it with leg,
would God apply my bike's brakes?

739
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:12,801
Mad man! Can a swimming pool have
Tsunami or God come to save you?

740
01:02:12,976 --> 01:02:15,342
That's why we're here.
- Do you've the RC book?

741
01:02:17,347 --> 01:02:18,507
lf you want this back,

742
01:02:18,681 --> 01:02:19,841
there's a boy in red shirt next street,

743
01:02:20,016 --> 01:02:23,008
give the bike to him and come tomorrow.
- Why should l give him?

744
01:02:23,186 --> 01:02:26,849
Split the bike's parts
saying it has a bomb,

745
01:02:27,023 --> 01:02:31,187
as usual say sorry to him,
and give those parts to him!

746
01:02:31,361 --> 01:02:32,521
Wrong sir.
- Why?

747
01:02:32,695 --> 01:02:36,153
He can't carry all the parts,
keep the engine with you sir.

748
01:02:36,332 --> 01:02:38,823
Which colour shirt he's wearing?
- Red!

749
01:02:44,841 --> 01:02:46,536
You're the red shirt guy, right?

750
01:02:58,221 --> 01:02:59,381
Happy?

751
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:02,388
What if it rains now?

752
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,221
Rain again? No way!
We sent the tankers.

753
01:03:05,395 --> 01:03:09,525
Your office is in Abids, there will be cyclone
not just rain before we reach.

754
01:03:09,699 --> 01:03:14,534
Find water tankers in Abids, boys!
lt must rain there now!

755
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:56,769
Good bike is there...
Girl is beside me...

756
01:03:56,913 --> 01:04:01,282
Cool breeze is blowing...
lt's pulling me...

757
01:04:01,451 --> 01:04:06,286
You've little mad...
And l like it...

758
01:04:06,456 --> 01:04:11,621
l've fallen for you...
you're my king..

759
01:04:11,794 --> 01:04:16,754
Bike is speeding up...
Beauty is devastating...

760
01:04:16,933 --> 01:04:22,462
l'm going mad...
don't attack me with your sensuality...

761
01:04:42,825 --> 01:04:48,127
When l see your sexy waist...
l lose my control...

762
01:04:48,298 --> 01:04:53,326
lf you sit on the pillion,
my front wheel goes up in air...

763
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:58,497
A little red from lips will make
your bike to ride without petrol...

764
01:04:58,675 --> 01:05:03,669
On seeing the sensuality of my body,
won't it speed off thousands of miles...

765
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:09,182
Your smiling face broke my heart...

766
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:14,187
Your perfume overwhelmed my nose...

767
01:05:14,357 --> 01:05:19,351
Youth has hit like typhoon...
Kissing mood is in the air...

768
01:05:19,529 --> 01:05:24,990
Just say yes and see,
you can't stand my speed...

769
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:06,399
Are you a beautiful page from
the legendary Kalidas' poetry...

770
01:06:06,576 --> 01:06:11,741
Are you the intoxication that has
come out from Devadas' wine bottle...

771
01:06:11,914 --> 01:06:16,749
O handsome man, you're strong and
well built like Arnold...

772
01:06:16,919 --> 01:06:21,913
You're fast like the bullet coming
out from the gun of James Bond...

773
01:06:22,091 --> 01:06:32,433
Your springy black hair moved in air...
My heart jumped in joy around you...

774
01:06:32,568 --> 01:06:37,767
Heart beats in a rhythm...
Time to change gear of love chariot...

775
01:06:37,907 --> 01:06:43,140
Virgin mesmerism is hovering over me...
lt's quite natural in love...

776
01:07:22,985 --> 01:07:23,474
What's that?

777
01:07:23,653 --> 01:07:25,644
Acid to bend the window grills.

778
01:07:26,155 --> 01:07:29,818
Welder to cut the bent grills.
- Glasses?

779
01:07:29,992 --> 01:07:31,152
To keep away fire sparks.

780
01:07:31,327 --> 01:07:33,318
What for this?
- For good grip.

781
01:07:36,632 --> 01:07:38,793
This is plastic explosive,
am l right?

782
01:07:40,503 --> 01:07:41,970
What for this?
- For attitude!

783
01:07:42,972 --> 01:07:45,133
Whatever it is, thief is a thief!
- Yes.

784
01:07:46,676 --> 01:07:49,008
He seems like master thief!
- Come in!

785
01:08:08,331 --> 01:08:09,491
Madhu...

786
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:12,657
Got anything?

787
01:08:12,835 --> 01:08:15,827
Bittu and Madhu's tickets are
booked for tomorrow's flight.

788
01:08:16,005 --> 01:08:17,700
To Dubai via Mumbai!
- For Madhu?

789
01:08:17,874 --> 01:08:20,172
ls she an accomplice in
the bank robbery?

790
01:08:20,343 --> 01:08:23,710
Cool sir, she doesn't even know to ogle.
How can she rob a bank?

791
01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:27,877
Shall we arrest Travel Murthy?
He may tell something.

792
01:08:28,050 --> 01:08:30,382
To catch the rat,
you must bait with an onion.

793
01:08:30,553 --> 01:08:31,884
Come straight!

794
01:08:32,054 --> 01:08:35,217
lf we arrest Murthy, Bittu will escape.
We must first catch Bittu.

795
01:08:36,559 --> 01:08:38,390
Let's put Murthy's office
under observation.

796
01:08:38,561 --> 01:08:41,291
lf Bittu comes tomorrow,
let's arrest both of them together.

797
01:08:55,745 --> 01:08:57,269
Who ordered it and
why are you delivering it to me?

798
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:02,740
Bittu?
- Where's my passport?

799
01:09:02,919 --> 01:09:03,647
Just a minute!

800
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,912
l've arranged a family too for you,
your wife has epilepsy.

801
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:09,922
To get sympathy in airport security check.

802
01:09:10,092 --> 01:09:11,252
Bombay flight is at 3 pm!

803
01:09:11,427 --> 01:09:13,918
Dubai flight leaves by night from there.
Your tickets.

804
01:09:15,231 --> 01:09:16,220
Who is my wife?

805
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:20,228
l didn't order it.

806
01:09:29,111 --> 01:09:29,600
What happened, Madhu?

807
01:09:29,779 --> 01:09:32,111
What else? Dieting, eating less
and fainting!

808
01:09:32,281 --> 01:09:33,441
lt has become fashion.

809
01:09:33,783 --> 01:09:36,274
What are you looking?
Help to take her to hospital.

810
01:09:48,297 --> 01:09:49,264
What's that?

811
01:09:49,432 --> 01:09:53,095
Someone would've ordered pizza, delivery bike.
- Zoom it.

812
01:09:56,272 --> 01:09:58,968
Box should've pizzas,
why clothes are there?

813
01:10:01,277 --> 01:10:03,643
Didn't you get it?
Bittu was here, uncle!

814
01:10:14,156 --> 01:10:15,316
Where's Madhu?

815
01:10:15,491 --> 01:10:17,391
She fell sick and
they took her to the hospital.

816
01:10:17,994 --> 01:10:19,985
Who? The pizza delivery boy?

817
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:26,799
That's him! He took Madhu to escape!

818
01:10:26,969 --> 01:10:28,664
He has a ticket for 3 pm Bombay flight.

819
01:10:35,011 --> 01:10:36,842
Stop...tell where are you going?

820
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,078
Why did you stop here?

821
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:51,019
We must go to the right.

822
01:10:51,193 --> 01:10:52,854
Yourjob is over with
handing over the passport.

823
01:10:53,029 --> 01:10:55,156
lt's my problem
where l go and how!

824
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:57,822
But to go to Dubai...
- l can travel from Bangalore too!

825
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,867
l'll board a flight tonight from there.
- What should l do now?

826
01:11:04,874 --> 01:11:10,210
Never ask the other man in life,
what should l do?

827
01:11:12,048 --> 01:11:15,211
You must have clarity yourself.

828
01:11:20,222 --> 01:11:24,886
Stop...stop...we must take right.
Why are you tensed?

829
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:27,222
Police have swarmed the airport.

830
01:11:27,396 --> 01:11:29,193
l'm sure he wouldn't go
to the airport.

831
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:33,362
We've his car number.
Where can he go?

832
01:11:35,538 --> 01:11:39,736
Black colour Merc, 444,
trace it immediately

833
01:11:41,911 --> 01:11:45,574
lt's going on Chennai Highway,
take a U turn. Let's get him.

834
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:49,411
No sir. He sent few people to East Vizag and
some to West during the bank robbery,

835
01:11:49,585 --> 01:11:50,745
He robbed the bank in central Vizag.

836
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:52,410
He's using the same pattern.

837
01:11:52,588 --> 01:11:56,752
Few people would go to airport,
few would be roaming on Chennai Highway,

838
01:11:56,926 --> 01:11:59,087
he would be whistling his
way to Bangalore.

839
01:11:59,261 --> 01:12:00,250
How can you be so sure?

840
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:02,397
l'll make him say hello
to you in 5 minutes.

841
01:12:11,574 --> 01:12:15,271
Look there, Bittu's vehicles.
- How can you be so sure?

842
01:12:21,784 --> 01:12:23,615
Though we've given them
so many directions,

843
01:12:23,786 --> 01:12:25,777
how could the police get so
much intelligence to catch us?

844
01:12:27,456 --> 01:12:30,619
l don't get it!

845
01:12:36,766 --> 01:12:38,097
Hey, you're jumping lanes!

846
01:12:38,601 --> 01:12:39,863
Breaking traffic rules.

847
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:41,959
Watch out!

848
01:12:52,148 --> 01:12:53,979
Drive carefully, we may die!

849
01:12:56,318 --> 01:13:00,311
Why are you banging him?
We may die man!

850
01:14:35,417 --> 01:14:37,317
This car man!

851
01:14:42,758 --> 01:14:44,089
Move...move...

852
01:14:45,427 --> 01:14:47,759
People may die!

853
01:14:49,899 --> 01:14:54,097
Please stop for a second,
l'll get down.
Please slowdown, l'll jump out!

854
01:14:54,236 --> 01:14:55,726
l'll get killed!

855
01:16:19,021 --> 01:16:22,013
Will you kill me for her?

856
01:16:22,191 --> 01:16:24,352
Can you? Will you dare?

857
01:16:24,526 --> 01:16:28,485
ls it like killing my brother alone?

858
01:16:28,697 --> 01:16:31,495
Did you or your bother build
temples to live for 100 years?

859
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,157
Bloody bank robbers!

860
01:16:33,335 --> 01:16:36,031
Any brother to you would die at 25!

861
01:16:36,205 --> 01:16:37,832
You'll also die in near future.

862
01:16:39,041 --> 01:16:42,533
Are you an astrologer
to predict my death?

863
01:16:43,545 --> 01:16:45,877
l'm telling your future now,

864
01:16:47,716 --> 01:16:51,208
l'll make you carry the
bodies of your entire family.

865
01:16:51,387 --> 01:16:55,881
Your shoulders must be strong.
- Don't worry about far away family.

866
01:16:56,225 --> 01:16:59,217
The girl at the end of
your gun barrel is my life.

867
01:16:59,395 --> 01:17:04,196
Your gun has ten bullets,
even if one bullet gets into her,

868
01:17:04,366 --> 01:17:06,698
if l don't shoot you dead before
you fire second bullet,

869
01:17:06,869 --> 01:17:08,063
l wasn't born to my father,
you bloody bastard!

870
01:17:08,237 --> 01:17:08,862
Eater's name is written
on every food grain.

871
01:17:09,071 --> 01:17:11,369
But the bullet that kills you
will have my name.

872
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:14,873
Bittu, l'm Ravindra Narayan,
your wake up call to death!

873
01:17:15,077 --> 01:17:18,740
l'll kill you...
- Don't just threaten me, bloody!

874
01:17:18,914 --> 01:17:22,077
You fire one bullet,
l'll put entire magazine into you.

875
01:17:22,251 --> 01:17:25,243
Are you mad? The girl is
with him, he'll kill her.

876
01:17:25,421 --> 01:17:27,412
How long can we be mute
spectators fearing death?

877
01:17:27,589 --> 01:17:34,256
Fire...fire...let me see!
- Don't provoke him.

878
01:17:38,067 --> 01:17:39,398
He's wantonly provoking you.
- Why are you talking to her?

879
01:17:39,568 --> 01:17:43,402
He's very intelligent man.
- l'm smarter than him.

880
01:17:43,572 --> 01:17:44,903
Kill me l say!...

881
01:17:52,448 --> 01:17:54,609
You'll not leave me...not leave me.

882
01:18:42,297 --> 01:18:45,164
They left me marooned on road.
Send me a car.

883
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:00,341
Why did Bittu kidnap her?
- l don't know.

884
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:11,181
Did you get Bittu?

885
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,692
No sir, we've put a red alert.

886
01:19:15,831 --> 01:19:16,820
Did he see you?

887
01:19:21,370 --> 01:19:25,204
lt's not safe for you to stay here,
must shift your base.

888
01:19:27,009 --> 01:19:29,534
Where to sir?
Guntur or Anakapalle?

889
01:19:32,214 --> 01:19:35,877
How would you feel with
a rain coat facing Tsunami?

890
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:38,376
l feel the same now
when you say that.

891
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,051
l don't get it one thing
for my common sense,

892
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:42,213
a thief runs away,
police catch him,

893
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:43,551
why is the reverse happening here?

894
01:19:43,725 --> 01:19:45,215
Thief is catching me,

895
01:19:45,394 --> 01:19:47,225
should l be on run
for helping police?

896
01:19:47,396 --> 01:19:49,694
Police need time, right?
- How much time you need sir?

897
01:19:49,865 --> 01:19:51,856
l got him in 15 minutes and
you let him off by morning.

898
01:19:52,034 --> 01:19:54,298
l got him in the middle of the road,
you couldn't catch him.

899
01:19:55,704 --> 01:19:57,865
Do you know the difference
between him and you,

900
01:19:58,040 --> 01:19:59,871
he doesn't care for life for money,

901
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:02,738
but you don't even get up
from your seat for the salary.

902
01:20:06,081 --> 01:20:09,073
The madness he has,
l've much more than him.

903
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:12,414
Let him hide inside earth,
l'll gun him down at point blank range.

904
01:20:13,589 --> 01:20:16,581
He must wet his pants on hearing
my name Ravi Narayan.

905
01:20:16,758 --> 01:20:20,592
lf l kill him police will not his
body also as evidence for postmortem.

906
01:20:22,898 --> 01:20:25,560
l'm sure about one thing,
l'll stay here only,

907
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:29,261
put my address in newspapers,
let me what the hell he can do...

908
01:20:32,274 --> 01:20:34,265
What's your connection with Bittu?

909
01:20:34,443 --> 01:20:35,432
l don't know anything.

910
01:20:35,611 --> 01:20:38,603
He said he was the girl's relative
and then kidnapped me too.

911
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:40,941
Why did he leave after kidnapping you?

912
01:20:42,284 --> 01:20:43,273
l'll tell you after
consulting my lawyer.

913
01:20:43,452 --> 01:20:45,443
What the hell will you consult, my foot!

914
01:20:46,288 --> 01:20:49,621
No need to discuss,
just write and get his sign.

915
01:20:49,791 --> 01:20:50,951
Do you want me to untie the knot?

916
01:20:51,126 --> 01:20:52,616
l don't know uncle,
l didn't think about it.

917
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:54,625
Maximum is 3 minutes.
- lf not?

918
01:20:54,796 --> 01:20:58,095
After that anytime is same.
- Right, dead body will co-operate.

919
01:21:02,938 --> 01:21:06,465
Police are conducting a big
sting operation for this girl.

920
01:21:07,476 --> 01:21:10,104
lt seems her office under
camera observation.

921
01:21:10,312 --> 01:21:12,473
That's why her kidnapping
news reached immediately.

922
01:21:12,648 --> 01:21:15,481
Why isn't she getting up, mother?
- May be she's dead.

923
01:21:16,485 --> 01:21:18,646
Doctors are not telling for money.

924
01:21:53,855 --> 01:21:58,349
How do you feel now?
Whatever it is you're very lucky.

925
01:21:58,527 --> 01:22:00,859
By strange coincidence Ravi
came to your office,

926
01:22:01,029 --> 01:22:04,328
and surprise l was there too
and saved you.

927
01:22:04,499 --> 01:22:06,831
lt happened coincidentally!

928
01:22:16,178 --> 01:22:17,372
How is Madhu now?

929
01:22:20,048 --> 01:22:23,381
What's your problem? Toothache?
Can l see Madhu?

930
01:22:39,201 --> 01:22:41,692
What have you done about it?
l mean the sacred thread.

931
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,030
l'll talk to you later.

932
01:22:43,205 --> 01:22:44,695
How is my daughter?

933
01:22:46,408 --> 01:22:47,807
What's your problem? Toothache?

934
01:22:48,577 --> 01:22:49,805
Can l see her?

935
01:22:50,912 --> 01:22:51,742
Okay.

936
01:23:01,923 --> 01:23:05,256
Lost money!
Lala is dead!

937
01:23:05,927 --> 01:23:08,589
l think Ravi will get us too.

938
01:23:09,398 --> 01:23:13,892
One push with this will get your
brain out along with fear, Koti.

939
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:16,435
Did you see those numbers?

940
01:23:16,905 --> 01:23:18,600
One, l must to kill Ravi's family.

941
01:23:20,909 --> 01:23:23,605
Two, l must kill him.

942
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:28,113
Three, we must escape from this country.

943
01:23:30,619 --> 01:23:33,782
lf you irritate me,
l may have to kill you too.

944
01:23:33,955 --> 01:23:38,790
My wish list would become 4,
but 3 is my lucky number.

945
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:39,949
Yours?

946
01:24:17,299 --> 01:24:19,631
Already finished?

947
01:24:19,801 --> 01:24:21,291
Uncle Brahmam!
- Called me sir?

948
01:24:21,503 --> 01:24:24,131
Return the stolen Beer bottle
and cashew nuts.

949
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:26,300
How do you know it?

950
01:24:26,508 --> 01:24:28,999
His shirt is wet with
bottle's wetness.

951
01:24:29,144 --> 01:24:32,011
Cashew nut masala is on his night dress.

952
01:24:34,516 --> 01:24:35,346
Give me some.

953
01:24:37,018 --> 01:24:40,681
You're so smart,
why did you cross swords with Bittu?

954
01:24:40,856 --> 01:24:43,518
l didn't sir, he's shouting at me.

955
01:24:43,692 --> 01:24:46,855
He has voice he'll shout,
he has a family, so he fears.

956
01:24:47,028 --> 01:24:48,689
What's your plan anyway?

957
01:24:48,864 --> 01:24:53,995
Very simple sir, l've simply 3 targets!

958
01:24:59,174 --> 01:25:02,166
l must bring parents from Vizag
and keep them safe here.

959
01:25:05,547 --> 01:25:08,539
l must convince Madhu again
and bring her back on track.

960
01:25:14,055 --> 01:25:17,547
Let's kill Bittu, sir!
He's irritating me too much!

961
01:25:18,727 --> 01:25:20,217
When are you proposing to do this?

962
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:24,024
Generally smart guys plan
and do it.

963
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:27,691
Too smart guys like me
plan while doing it.

964
01:25:34,376 --> 01:25:35,570
What son?
- Have you started?

965
01:25:35,744 --> 01:25:37,735
l've booked tickets in Garib Rath.

966
01:25:37,913 --> 01:25:41,246
Tell neighbors to keep
an eye on our house.

967
01:25:41,416 --> 01:25:42,747
No need to tell them,
they'll always watch our home.

968
01:25:42,918 --> 01:25:44,749
Take a taxi to the station.

969
01:25:44,920 --> 01:25:46,581
Taxi is expensive, auto is enough.

970
01:25:46,755 --> 01:25:49,417
Father, don't show your stinginess here.
Just do as l say.

971
01:25:49,591 --> 01:25:51,252
Tickets?
- l've, get in.

972
01:25:51,426 --> 01:25:53,917
ls it a great plan to
buy ticket and board train?

973
01:25:54,095 --> 01:25:56,563
Now Bittu's group would
get down before my home.

974
01:26:00,402 --> 01:26:01,767
They'll see the door locked.

975
01:26:03,238 --> 01:26:04,068
They'll ask the neighbours.

976
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:07,231
Though we share common wall,
we don't know a bit about them.

977
01:26:09,411 --> 01:26:12,107
People with money or gun
don't take no as answer.

978
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:16,444
Garib Rath leaves in an hour,
one bag, two suitcases, 3 passengers.

979
01:26:16,618 --> 01:26:18,279
They went to the station in taxi.

980
01:26:18,453 --> 01:26:20,785
lt you remove the gun,
l'll walk to my home.

981
01:26:25,460 --> 01:26:27,121
Where are you now, father?

982
01:26:27,295 --> 01:26:29,092
lf we take left, we'll reach
station in 10 minutes.

983
01:26:29,297 --> 01:26:31,595
Take right and hit highway
and come to Hyderabad.

984
01:26:31,766 --> 01:26:33,427
What?
To Hyderabad in car?

985
01:26:33,635 --> 01:26:36,433
Yes, in car!
- He'll ask our property.

986
01:26:36,638 --> 01:26:38,265
Seetharam will pay it, come.

987
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:41,273
Me? Why should l pay?
- Go to Hyderabad.

988
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:46,474
Like Pavan searches for Bhumika
in the film 'Kushi'

989
01:26:46,648 --> 01:26:50,482
Bittu's men will be searching
for my parents in station.

990
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,981
This is what you call planning.

991
01:26:54,155 --> 01:26:57,488
People have a knife or gun,

992
01:26:57,659 --> 01:27:00,321
you've removed the pin and
sitting on a grenade.

993
01:27:00,495 --> 01:27:02,463
Why did you let him into your home?

994
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:04,792
More over you're feeding him
with Beers and cashew nuts.

995
01:27:04,966 --> 01:27:08,129
What are you planning
to do with Bittu?

996
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:11,295
Sir, you got drunk and
forgetting the order.

997
01:27:13,842 --> 01:27:15,469
My darling Madhu...

998
01:27:32,861 --> 01:27:35,352
What have l done?
Why are you so angry on me?

999
01:27:36,831 --> 01:27:38,492
Will you provoke him to kill me?

1000
01:27:38,667 --> 01:27:42,000
That was drama, just like that.
He won't kill you.

1001
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:44,866
You used me after telling white lies.

1002
01:27:45,006 --> 01:27:48,339
Don' use that word,
people may mistake you.

1003
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:50,341
l'll beat you with my slipper.

1004
01:27:50,512 --> 01:27:53,208
lsn't there control to your tongue?
Will you say whatever you feel?

1005
01:27:53,381 --> 01:27:56,043
You mean....pleas you tell me sir.

1006
01:27:56,217 --> 01:27:58,549
l made Miss Worst
to Miss World girl,

1007
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,052
look, every man is ogling at her.

1008
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:04,722
Do you know how many dreams
l had for you?- What dreams?

1009
01:28:04,893 --> 01:28:06,383
Like we're married...

1010
01:28:06,561 --> 01:28:09,689
Like having two sons Bobby and Bablu.

1011
01:28:09,864 --> 01:28:12,196
Make one as daughter,
it'll add colour to life.

1012
01:28:12,367 --> 01:28:16,201
Two moustaches and beards won't be fine.
- Get lots!

1013
01:28:16,905 --> 01:28:18,736
l started wearing jeans for him.

1014
01:28:18,907 --> 01:28:23,071
To avoid disturbance in future to kiss
l removed glasses and wearing lens.

1015
01:28:23,244 --> 01:28:25,235
Didn't l do anything then?
- ls it my mistake?

1016
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:27,075
You're saying as
if l did the mistake.

1017
01:28:28,917 --> 01:28:31,249
Not you or me, he'll tell us,
please tell me sir.

1018
01:28:43,565 --> 01:28:45,226
l kept aside to eat
without disturbance.

1019
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:49,063
You both are fighting over something.

1020
01:28:49,237 --> 01:28:50,465
Can you please start again?

1021
01:28:55,410 --> 01:28:56,934
Bloody deaf!

1022
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:02,943
Madhu, no need auto, l'll drop you.
l'll drop you on my bike.

1023
01:29:03,118 --> 01:29:08,613
Yes but l want same bike, same colour,
and the same man must bring it.

1024
01:29:08,790 --> 01:29:11,623
Shall l close my eyes?
- What are you saying?

1025
01:29:15,797 --> 01:29:16,764
Do you want the bike again sir?

1026
01:29:16,931 --> 01:29:18,592
Go...go..
- Want me to go that side?

1027
01:29:18,767 --> 01:29:21,793
l'm going on urgent work,
if you want, take it.

1028
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:24,438
Why did you give your bike that day?

1029
01:29:24,606 --> 01:29:30,806
A police officer in the next
street threatened to break it.

1030
01:29:30,979 --> 01:29:32,640
Why did you smile then?

1031
01:29:32,814 --> 01:29:34,805
Like this? He told me to smile and give.

1032
01:29:36,484 --> 01:29:37,974
This wasn't my mistake.

1033
01:29:38,153 --> 01:29:40,212
Trust me, Seetharam made me
do it under threat.

1034
01:29:44,325 --> 01:29:45,485
Please listen to me.

1035
01:29:46,995 --> 01:29:51,455
Had it not rained then, l wouldn't
have talked to you or had tea.

1036
01:29:51,633 --> 01:29:53,294
Water tank is here only!

1037
01:29:54,636 --> 01:29:57,469
Why are you looking embarrassed?
Was rain also a plan?

1038
01:30:00,008 --> 01:30:01,839
How can l plan rain?
- Tell me the truth.

1039
01:30:05,346 --> 01:30:08,679
Oh God! How did it rain when l wished?

1040
01:30:46,554 --> 01:30:49,045
Don't get angry,
my honey eyed beauty...

1041
01:30:55,563 --> 01:30:58,361
Don't frown, O jasmine...

1042
01:31:00,368 --> 01:31:05,067
Like police car siren...
Like an ambulance horn...

1043
01:31:05,206 --> 01:31:09,905
Why are you making so much noise
like you've swallowed a loud speaker?

1044
01:31:10,078 --> 01:31:14,412
Don't add chilly to the love wound
and tie a thread to my heart...

1045
01:31:15,583 --> 01:31:19,246
Don't let it fly as you wish
here and there...

1046
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:22,321
Hey don't leave me hanging...

1047
01:31:24,092 --> 01:31:26,925
Hey don't trash me and run away...

1048
01:31:28,429 --> 01:31:33,059
Hey don't leave him hanging...

1049
01:31:33,234 --> 01:31:38,399
Hey don't trash him and run away...

1050
01:31:56,457 --> 01:31:58,948
Without you accompanying me
when l went to temple...

1051
01:31:59,127 --> 01:32:01,118
God himself sent me back...

1052
01:32:01,296 --> 01:32:06,097
Pub has no entry board
if l go there without you...

1053
01:32:08,269 --> 01:32:12,763
Mirror too scolds me
if sees me single...

1054
01:32:12,974 --> 01:32:17,968
My shadow is confused unable
to recognize me...

1055
01:32:18,146 --> 01:32:22,640
Like salt less food,
like dance less Chiranjeevi film...

1056
01:32:22,817 --> 01:32:27,311
Without you l don't have any life...

1057
01:32:27,488 --> 01:32:30,480
Hey don't wash and dry me...

1058
01:32:31,826 --> 01:32:35,660
Hey don't squeeze me out...

1059
01:32:36,798 --> 01:32:40,131
Hey don't wash and dry him...

1060
01:32:41,469 --> 01:32:46,338
Hey don't squeeze him out..

1061
01:33:11,833 --> 01:33:16,327
lf you play cricket,
l'll buy each ticket paying a lakh...

1062
01:33:16,504 --> 01:33:21,498
lf umpire gives you out,
l'll seek vengeance on him...

1063
01:33:23,678 --> 01:33:28,047
l'm the crore people waiting
in queue for your smile...

1064
01:33:28,216 --> 01:33:33,210
Though you make me cry,
l'm the lone joker to make you laugh...

1065
01:33:33,388 --> 01:33:35,720
Liquor is there for heart fails...

1066
01:33:35,890 --> 01:33:38,051
People are there as love failures...

1067
01:33:38,226 --> 01:33:42,390
l was fresh like fruit but
you've made a patient...

1068
01:33:42,563 --> 01:33:45,532
Hey don't tear me into pieces...

1069
01:33:47,201 --> 01:33:50,864
Hey don't kill and bury me...

1070
01:33:51,873 --> 01:33:55,468
Hey don't tear him into pieces...

1071
01:33:56,878 --> 01:34:01,747
Hey don't kill and bury him...

1072
01:34:20,568 --> 01:34:22,559
Dear...
- Father!

1073
01:34:23,905 --> 01:34:26,897
Calm down dear!
ls he teasing you?

1074
01:34:27,108 --> 01:34:29,906
you feel tortured, dear?
- Yes father.

1075
01:34:30,111 --> 01:34:35,105
Did anyone smile at you
when you had clip for teeth? No!

1076
01:34:35,283 --> 01:34:39,276
Did anyone see when you wore glasses?
No!

1077
01:34:39,454 --> 01:34:44,619
Did anyone recognize you as girl
when you wore churidhar? No!

1078
01:34:44,792 --> 01:34:46,953
Look now, how many fans you have!

1079
01:34:47,962 --> 01:34:49,793
Why are you talking to him?
Who are you man?

1080
01:34:49,931 --> 01:34:52,764
What's this nuisance before my home?
You don't know about me,

1081
01:34:52,934 --> 01:34:55,596
if l beat, for the effect
you better ask him.

1082
01:34:55,770 --> 01:34:57,601
Body aches will be for many days.

1083
01:34:59,774 --> 01:35:03,141
Will you please give me
some coconut oil, aunt?

1084
01:35:04,312 --> 01:35:07,304
l saw people drinking water if thirsty,
l'm seeing only you having oil.

1085
01:35:07,482 --> 01:35:08,813
May be from Kerala.

1086
01:35:24,465 --> 01:35:25,523
lt is shining!

1087
01:35:26,634 --> 01:35:27,623
lt fires too!

1088
01:35:29,637 --> 01:35:32,970
Hey pig! At least stop
crying while eating!

1089
01:35:33,174 --> 01:35:37,508
Give some to your sister too,
she looks like a famine country's model.

1090
01:35:37,678 --> 01:35:38,576
Yes!

1091
01:35:39,347 --> 01:35:40,507
Aunt!

1092
01:35:40,681 --> 01:35:45,015
lf you act smart using this
as ruse, l will...

1093
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,920
What were you saying till now...

1094
01:35:51,192 --> 01:35:52,022
Shut up!

1095
01:35:52,360 --> 01:35:55,193
How would you look after Madhu from now?
- Like an angel!

1096
01:35:55,363 --> 01:35:58,332
Will you show the offering
and eat it yourself?

1097
01:35:58,833 --> 01:35:59,993
Look after her like human.

1098
01:36:00,201 --> 01:36:03,193
lf there's any difference
in the treatment.

1099
01:36:03,371 --> 01:36:05,498
l'll gun you down!

1100
01:36:09,377 --> 01:36:11,004
Think about me, please.

1101
01:36:14,215 --> 01:36:15,876
lt went off by mistake,
please don't forget about me.

1102
01:36:21,556 --> 01:36:24,218
To catch Bittu,
Travel Murthy must come out.

1103
01:36:24,392 --> 01:36:27,054
lf Travel Murthy is to come out,
Uncle must in.

1104
01:36:31,699 --> 01:36:33,223
Do you know whom you dared to arrest?

1105
01:36:33,367 --> 01:36:35,858
l'm drunk like you in day time,
l've arrested knowing well.

1106
01:36:36,037 --> 01:36:37,231
Shut your gob and sleep.

1107
01:36:38,706 --> 01:36:39,570
Why did they arrest you?

1108
01:36:39,707 --> 01:36:42,232
l'm accused of making fake passports.
- What's wrong in it?

1109
01:36:43,411 --> 01:36:45,402
That's an art!
Are they arresting artistes too?

1110
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:46,569
What's your case?

1111
01:36:46,747 --> 01:36:49,238
They arrested me for making
come true a mother's wish.

1112
01:36:49,417 --> 01:36:50,577
Mother's wish?

1113
01:36:51,919 --> 01:36:57,414
Yes, a mother told her son if you're
mischief a devil will catch you.

1114
01:36:58,259 --> 01:36:59,419
He didn't believe it.

1115
01:37:00,595 --> 01:37:01,926
He came out.

1116
01:37:02,763 --> 01:37:06,893
lf what his mother said doesn't
come true, he'll never come in life.

1117
01:37:07,401 --> 01:37:11,565
So l took the risk and kidnapped him.

1118
01:37:14,075 --> 01:37:17,909
Strange the boy's mother
slapped a case on me.

1119
01:37:18,446 --> 01:37:20,107
For kidnapping her son.

1120
01:37:34,795 --> 01:37:37,263
Are you planning to make
a hole to wall and escape?

1121
01:37:37,431 --> 01:37:39,092
We'll shift you to sub jail tomorrow,

1122
01:37:39,267 --> 01:37:41,997
the plates as well as the plates
are thicker and stronger. Try there!

1123
01:37:45,773 --> 01:37:46,637
What?

1124
01:37:46,774 --> 01:37:49,641
l want a bag full of papers
and a dozen pens.- Why?

1125
01:37:49,810 --> 01:37:51,801
To write my autobiography.
- You?

1126
01:37:51,946 --> 01:37:55,814
Can Gandhi and Nehru only
write autobiographies in jail?

1127
01:37:55,983 --> 01:37:58,645
Do they only have souls?
Don't l have it?

1128
01:37:58,819 --> 01:38:00,980
l too have a soul and it has a story.

1129
01:38:01,155 --> 01:38:03,646
l don't have paper and pens,
get it for me.

1130
01:38:03,824 --> 01:38:08,488
Give few papers and pens from Writer.
lt seems he'll write autobiography.

1131
01:38:22,843 --> 01:38:24,674
What?
- l want a cup of tea, sir.

1132
01:38:24,845 --> 01:38:26,176
l'll beat you with slippers.

1133
01:38:26,347 --> 01:38:28,679
Writer's block sir.
Can't write now.

1134
01:38:28,849 --> 01:38:32,080
He'll irritate us like this,
let's go out.- Okay sir.

1135
01:38:34,021 --> 01:38:36,512
Not just you, we'll also
come out following you.

1136
01:38:44,665 --> 01:38:47,657
lf it is open both of them can escape!

1137
01:38:47,835 --> 01:38:49,996
Don't be excited, let's walk casually.

1138
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:57,534
What's that?
- Phones.

1139
01:38:57,712 --> 01:38:59,009
Who is he?
- Fans!

1140
01:38:59,213 --> 01:39:01,374
Can't he give it straight?
Why did he a take a round?

1141
01:39:01,549 --> 01:39:03,540
Fans have emotions only, no logic.

1142
01:39:03,718 --> 01:39:06,710
Call me by evening, my number is in it.

1143
01:39:15,730 --> 01:39:17,357
He'll call from the phone
you gave him, right?

1144
01:39:17,531 --> 01:39:19,692
Surely sir. He trusts me.

1145
01:39:20,701 --> 01:39:23,864
lf he doesn't use it,
it's difficult to catch Bittu.

1146
01:39:31,412 --> 01:39:32,902
Ravi is alive!

1147
01:39:35,916 --> 01:39:38,407
l'll not go from here
till l kill him.

1148
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:46,754
He must get dejected in life
and commit suicide.

1149
01:39:47,595 --> 01:39:49,256
You can't even touch him.

1150
01:39:50,398 --> 01:39:55,734
You asked for men, van, crane
and took lakhs of money from me.

1151
01:39:55,903 --> 01:40:00,772
l created a family for you and
spent lakhs to get you passports.

1152
01:40:00,908 --> 01:40:07,279
When Sattar died, l paid compensation
to his family and got the papers.

1153
01:40:08,282 --> 01:40:10,443
You couldn't go to airport
and catch a flight.

1154
01:40:10,618 --> 01:40:13,451
l've spent more than
Rs.1.5 crores on you.

1155
01:40:13,621 --> 01:40:17,182
This coffee is extra expense to me
and bonus to you, have it.

1156
01:40:18,125 --> 01:40:19,956
Why is he angry?

1157
01:40:21,295 --> 01:40:25,925
You haven't anything till now
other than this sign language.

1158
01:40:26,100 --> 01:40:30,628
Had l trusted Ravi he would've
looted the bank in 15 minutes.

1159
01:40:30,771 --> 01:40:34,468
A 25 year old young man is
giving you a run for your money.

1160
01:40:34,642 --> 01:40:37,270
Go and lick is underarms.

1161
01:40:37,812 --> 01:40:39,473
Sitting here shamelessly!

1162
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:53,153
lf a man ogles a woman
when her husband is nearby,

1163
01:40:53,327 --> 01:40:55,158
do you know how bad she'd feel?

1164
01:40:55,663 --> 01:40:59,531
When you praised him before me,
l had the same feelings.

1165
01:41:00,301 --> 01:41:03,498
Sign language?
Do you know what did l tell her?

1166
01:41:03,671 --> 01:41:05,298
l told her l'll stab you.

1167
01:41:05,973 --> 01:41:10,672
Never pass comments on impaired.
Wrong, it's wrong.

1168
01:41:12,680 --> 01:41:18,846
lf l say sorry now,
she may not hear it. Save my life.

1169
01:41:19,019 --> 01:41:21,180
My heart is broken.

1170
01:41:23,023 --> 01:41:25,355
l don't care whether you live or die.

1171
01:41:25,526 --> 01:41:26,857
Money!

1172
01:41:29,530 --> 01:41:31,327
Rs.1500 crores!

1173
01:41:33,334 --> 01:41:36,701
l'll give it to you, save my life.

1174
01:41:36,837 --> 01:41:39,533
Money...do you've money?
- Yes.

1175
01:41:40,007 --> 01:41:42,532
Money is there!

1176
01:41:42,710 --> 01:41:45,042
But we saw money burnt to ashes.

1177
01:41:45,179 --> 01:41:47,374
But l saw it getting burnt.

1178
01:41:48,549 --> 01:41:53,612
Only the trailer burned,
l had shifted the money earlier.

1179
01:41:59,226 --> 01:42:00,557
Where have you hidden the money?

1180
01:42:01,729 --> 01:42:02,889
Where?

1181
01:42:04,698 --> 01:42:05,926
Where?

1182
01:42:14,575 --> 01:42:15,974
He's dead, Bittu.

1183
01:42:19,213 --> 01:42:20,976
Can l make a call?
- Do it.

1184
01:42:35,763 --> 01:42:39,722
l suspected he'll not use the phone,
so l planted a transmitter on him.

1185
01:42:50,244 --> 01:42:50,608
l'm Murthy here, sir.

1186
01:42:50,778 --> 01:42:52,609
Getting bail is difficult, so l escaped.

1187
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:53,769
lt's all commotion here.

1188
01:42:53,948 --> 01:42:55,279
lt's very difficult to
send Bittu out of country.

1189
01:42:55,449 --> 01:42:59,442
First know with whom
you're talking to, Murthy.

1190
01:43:02,623 --> 01:43:04,022
Where's Varadarajulu?

1191
01:43:05,459 --> 01:43:07,120
He's out of coverage area.

1192
01:43:07,461 --> 01:43:10,294
l came out with great
difficulty to talk to him.

1193
01:43:11,098 --> 01:43:14,625
You're not that smart.
- No sir. l managed to escape.

1194
01:43:14,768 --> 01:43:20,434
The man who made you escape,
the man who is making you talk...

1195
01:43:21,642 --> 01:43:22,802
l'm telling him,

1196
01:43:32,653 --> 01:43:34,814
l want to tell you a small story, Ravi.

1197
01:43:35,489 --> 01:43:39,823
Everyday my father used to come drunk
and beat me and my brother.

1198
01:43:40,661 --> 01:43:45,121
l managed but Lala was very young.
He used to cry a lot!

1199
01:43:45,299 --> 01:43:51,966
One night a thief smashed my father's
head and took his purse.

1200
01:43:52,139 --> 01:43:55,302
He was hit strongly and
my father died.

1201
01:43:55,843 --> 01:43:57,834
After that my brother never cried in life.

1202
01:43:58,012 --> 01:44:01,413
One thing nobody knows,
even my brother too.

1203
01:44:03,017 --> 01:44:04,348
l was that thief.

1204
01:44:10,691 --> 01:44:13,182
l killed my father for beating him.

1205
01:44:14,862 --> 01:44:18,320
You killed him,
what would l do with you?

1206
01:44:21,502 --> 01:44:23,868
l'm leaving it to your imagination.

1207
01:44:28,342 --> 01:44:29,707
Let's have a tea break.

1208
01:44:30,511 --> 01:44:31,705
Do you've sense or not?

1209
01:44:31,879 --> 01:44:34,712
He's warning you,
don't you've any fear?

1210
01:44:34,882 --> 01:44:36,873
There's trap in fear,
we mustn't fear anyone.

1211
01:44:37,051 --> 01:44:40,043
Let's take on him.
- No...

1212
01:44:40,220 --> 01:44:45,214
lf hope can cure a cancer patient,
fear would kill an ulcer patient.

1213
01:44:50,531 --> 01:44:53,022
He threatened to kill you,
aren't you scared?

1214
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:55,725
Death has no feelings, just sharpness.

1215
01:44:55,903 --> 01:44:59,361
l'll also kill him,
he boasted and l didn't.

1216
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:00,529
That's the difference.

1217
01:45:02,543 --> 01:45:04,238
Uncle! Did you see Madhu?

1218
01:45:07,247 --> 01:45:10,239
Everything is blur with your shot,
l don't see anything.

1219
01:45:12,086 --> 01:45:15,920
Uncle, l'll not bear her anymore,
l'll use force!

1220
01:45:20,594 --> 01:45:21,253
Come.

1221
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:28,390
Stop! You don't know about me,
don't neglect me.

1222
01:45:28,569 --> 01:45:31,561
Yes, l don't know about you,
l don't know if your love is true,

1223
01:45:31,772 --> 01:45:33,239
l don't know if your name
is true or not.

1224
01:45:36,777 --> 01:45:37,937
You want my details, right?

1225
01:45:38,112 --> 01:45:39,773
My name is Ravi,
my father is Narayanamurthy,

1226
01:45:39,947 --> 01:45:42,939
my mother is Kameshwari,
my sister is Raji...

1227
01:45:47,121 --> 01:45:50,284
Nobody is giving direction
to Seetharam's house.

1228
01:45:50,457 --> 01:45:51,788
We're searching for 3 hours now.

1229
01:45:51,959 --> 01:45:55,292
Father, l mean...
My father!

1230
01:45:58,766 --> 01:46:00,256
What timing is yours!

1231
01:46:00,434 --> 01:46:01,924
Did you keep them in next street?

1232
01:46:02,102 --> 01:46:04,263
They made an entry as soon as
l said about them.

1233
01:46:04,438 --> 01:46:05,598
They're my real parents.

1234
01:46:05,806 --> 01:46:08,604
Hello, he's shameless!
Shouldn't you've it?

1235
01:46:08,809 --> 01:46:09,798
Who is she?

1236
01:46:09,977 --> 01:46:11,808
Do you've to accept to
be his father if he asks?

1237
01:46:11,979 --> 01:46:13,469
Do you've any resemblance with him?

1238
01:46:13,647 --> 01:46:16,138
He's after me.
- Mother, don't talk mad.

1239
01:46:16,316 --> 01:46:20,309
Your mother is very homely.
- Why is she talking too much?

1240
01:46:20,487 --> 01:46:22,478
Your character has no dialogues,
keep quiet.

1241
01:46:22,656 --> 01:46:24,487
l'm warning you, l'll beat her.

1242
01:46:24,658 --> 01:46:26,819
l'll talk to her...
- Why are you begging her?

1243
01:46:26,994 --> 01:46:28,154
You took money, right?

1244
01:46:28,328 --> 01:46:30,159
Money...- Money?...- Money?
- Haven't you?

1245
01:46:30,297 --> 01:46:32,128
Have you gone mad, Madhu?

1246
01:46:32,299 --> 01:46:37,134
l know my son is cheat but l think
he's not so cheap to change parents.

1247
01:46:37,304 --> 01:46:40,296
One more thing, l've complete
faith in my wife.

1248
01:46:40,474 --> 01:46:42,840
Don't try to spoil it
after 25 years of marriage.

1249
01:46:43,010 --> 01:46:46,002
lt may be a bad word to you
but he's my son. She's my daughter.

1250
01:46:46,180 --> 01:46:48,512
lf you marry him,
she's your half husband.

1251
01:46:48,682 --> 01:46:52,345
She'll rip out your skin,
she's not as good as she looks.

1252
01:46:52,853 --> 01:46:54,184
Take right and go straight, father.

1253
01:46:54,354 --> 01:46:56,515
We'll go straight, you be straight.

1254
01:46:58,692 --> 01:47:00,523
Oh my God!

1255
01:47:00,694 --> 01:47:03,527
Should l love you really?
- l'll beat you.

1256
01:47:03,664 --> 01:47:06,861
lf you lie always and tell the truth
once, this will be the result.

1257
01:47:10,671 --> 01:47:12,662
Stop!...

1258
01:47:16,877 --> 01:47:17,502
Hold this.

1259
01:47:19,713 --> 01:47:23,547
What for?
- You're not staying put
in one place, so.

1260
01:47:23,717 --> 01:47:24,877
Please listen to me.

1261
01:47:25,052 --> 01:47:29,216
l love you so much.
l'm mad about you.

1262
01:47:29,389 --> 01:47:31,050
Please listen to me.
Marry me.

1263
01:47:31,225 --> 01:47:32,556
l'll look after you like a princess.

1264
01:47:32,726 --> 01:47:33,886
One more thing.

1265
01:47:34,061 --> 01:47:37,053
This is little risky matter,
keeping it for safety.

1266
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:43,067
lt has come this far,
so l'm telling you shamelessly.

1267
01:47:43,203 --> 01:47:45,194
l'm waiting eagerly for our first night.

1268
01:47:45,372 --> 01:47:48,705
We must work hard and
have children like this. Okay?

1269
01:47:48,909 --> 01:47:50,240
Don't cry, please smile.

1270
01:47:50,410 --> 01:47:52,241
l'm scared...l'm going.

1271
01:48:01,088 --> 01:48:04,421
You home has gate,
l've doubt to jump over it...

1272
01:48:04,591 --> 01:48:09,085
Streetlights don't burn in your lane,
l'm new to the area...

1273
01:48:11,899 --> 01:48:15,232
There's a dog before the gate,
which barks me to stop...

1274
01:48:15,402 --> 01:48:19,634
lt has big teeth and
makes me scary...

1275
01:48:20,941 --> 01:48:24,104
There's a beggar before your home,
he's wearing a holed shorts...

1276
01:48:24,278 --> 01:48:27,941
l look like ajoker to his eyes...

1277
01:48:28,115 --> 01:48:31,778
lf you wake up and
jump from balcony...

1278
01:48:31,952 --> 01:48:35,285
Let's rock in love...

1279
01:48:35,455 --> 01:48:39,118
Let's celebrate our marriage...

1280
01:49:11,158 --> 01:49:16,994
There's a coffee house in Koti,
it's famous for cappuccino...

1281
01:49:18,131 --> 01:49:21,623
lf your hot lips touch
the hot coffee cups...

1282
01:49:21,802 --> 01:49:25,169
Hands under the table play
the game of love...

1283
01:49:25,305 --> 01:49:31,175
ls yours coffee drinking face?
l know your bloody idea...

1284
01:49:32,512 --> 01:49:36,004
Wearing sleeveless dresses and
miniskirts showing knees...

1285
01:49:36,183 --> 01:49:39,516
Your hungry looks are
a big nuisance...

1286
01:49:39,686 --> 01:49:43,178
No Chitti, l got a naughty thought...

1287
01:49:43,357 --> 01:49:46,690
l want to hold you before everyone
and give a French kiss...

1288
01:49:46,860 --> 01:49:50,694
To rock my force and my style...

1289
01:50:33,373 --> 01:50:39,403
There's a theatre in old city
that plays old love films...

1290
01:50:40,580 --> 01:50:43,913
Watch a reel munching popcorn and
pass the interval with a vegetable cutlet...

1291
01:50:44,084 --> 01:50:47,576
Let's learn the alphabets of love
watching duets every 15 minutes...

1292
01:50:47,754 --> 01:50:54,751
Stop narrating tales,
don't try to fool me...

1293
01:50:54,928 --> 01:50:58,386
Corner seat in empty theatre
and one coke with two straws...

1294
01:50:58,565 --> 01:51:01,898
You'll get mischievous
exploring all over me...

1295
01:51:02,102 --> 01:51:05,401
Hey not like that,
how am l to manage her?

1296
01:51:05,572 --> 01:51:09,099
Do Jesus and Allah have to come
back again to convince you?

1297
01:51:09,276 --> 01:51:13,440
lf you come to watch
my matinee show...

1298
01:51:43,477 --> 01:51:46,139
She' thin like a stick,
how could you like her?

1299
01:51:46,313 --> 01:51:48,645
Zero size, that's the latest fad.

1300
01:51:49,483 --> 01:51:52,316
She scolded me.
- She slapped me.

1301
01:51:53,320 --> 01:51:55,982
He would've done something
to make her so angry.

1302
01:52:00,994 --> 01:52:01,653
What?

1303
01:52:13,807 --> 01:52:16,799
What would they think
if you enter my bedroom?

1304
01:52:18,345 --> 01:52:22,679
My father and step mother are
coming to fix marriage.- Now?

1305
01:52:23,183 --> 01:52:26,914
She doesn't know you're
the bridegroom.
l told my father only.

1306
01:52:28,855 --> 01:52:31,346
You must manage my step mom.
- Are you mad?

1307
01:52:31,525 --> 01:52:34,688
Manage your step mom?
Do you know what you're saying?

1308
01:52:34,861 --> 01:52:37,352
l'm unable to manage for
what you had done already, go.

1309
01:52:37,531 --> 01:52:39,158
This is not the right time.
Go...go away!

1310
01:52:41,668 --> 01:52:42,327
Shall l go away?

1311
01:52:42,502 --> 01:52:44,834
l didn't mean you to go literally.

1312
01:52:45,005 --> 01:52:46,996
lt was big trouble yesterday.

1313
01:52:47,207 --> 01:52:50,699
Moreover you don't know about my father.

1314
01:52:50,844 --> 01:52:54,712
lf he comes to know this,
do you know how angry he would be?

1315
01:52:56,716 --> 01:52:58,047
My father is...

1316
01:53:00,053 --> 01:53:02,044
Tell me...

1317
01:53:07,561 --> 01:53:08,721
Tell me!

1318
01:53:11,364 --> 01:53:13,355
Wear clothes, my throat has gone dry.

1319
01:53:37,757 --> 01:53:38,917
Why did you come here?

1320
01:53:39,092 --> 01:53:40,753
As if you're great Aishwarya Rai!

1321
01:53:40,927 --> 01:53:42,918
l came here following your daughter.

1322
01:53:43,096 --> 01:53:46,725
Are you planning her marriage
in my absence? l'll kill you.

1323
01:53:46,900 --> 01:53:48,561
Do you know this is a
great police officer's house?

1324
01:53:48,735 --> 01:53:50,965
Then, who is the groom?

1325
01:53:53,273 --> 01:53:54,069
ls it him?

1326
01:53:59,446 --> 01:54:00,606
He?

1327
01:54:01,448 --> 01:54:02,608
l like him.

1328
01:54:13,126 --> 01:54:17,028
Ravi, chemistry is working out
between me and her.

1329
01:54:19,432 --> 01:54:21,923
What's this nastily?
She's my mother-in-law.

1330
01:54:22,102 --> 01:54:24,593
She's her step mother, right?
- So what?

1331
01:54:26,473 --> 01:54:30,807
Okay, since you're feeling so much,
we'll elope after your marriage.

1332
01:54:31,811 --> 01:54:33,642
l want to talk to the groom.

1333
01:54:43,156 --> 01:54:44,817
l like you so much.

1334
01:54:49,663 --> 01:54:53,622
When you talk to me,
my palms are sweating.

1335
01:54:54,467 --> 01:54:56,697
Tell me.
- What did you like in us?

1336
01:54:56,970 --> 01:54:59,962
You've made me raise my head high!

1337
01:55:02,976 --> 01:55:04,341
What do you do?

1338
01:55:05,145 --> 01:55:06,407
Stealing!

1339
01:55:06,846 --> 01:55:08,677
You've already stolen a heart!

1340
01:55:18,191 --> 01:55:22,525
Don't know why l felt like
looking into your eyes.

1341
01:55:25,498 --> 01:55:27,159
Whether this society accepts it or not,

1342
01:55:27,367 --> 01:55:29,164
l don't care if you think
l'm overdoing it,

1343
01:55:29,369 --> 01:55:31,530
l'll marry her.
- You...

1344
01:55:32,005 --> 01:55:33,370
Leave my hand.
- Have you gone mad?

1345
01:55:33,540 --> 01:55:36,168
You came here to fix your daughter's
marriage and having affair with servant.

1346
01:55:36,376 --> 01:55:38,173
Servant? He's the groom, right?

1347
01:55:38,378 --> 01:55:41,040
l'm like his son,
how can he be the groom?

1348
01:55:41,548 --> 01:55:42,708
He's the groom!

1349
01:55:44,384 --> 01:55:45,874
l'll not accept.
- Why?

1350
01:55:46,052 --> 01:55:49,385
l was married to an old man,
so she should also marry an old man.

1351
01:55:51,224 --> 01:55:52,714
What have you done?

1352
01:55:52,892 --> 01:55:55,884
Slapping the cheeks which should
be smooched with kisses.

1353
01:55:57,564 --> 01:55:59,191
He steals everything
and she slapped him.

1354
01:55:59,366 --> 01:56:01,698
That's not enough for him.
He deserves more.

1355
01:56:07,574 --> 01:56:09,405
Don't park the car,
l'll come back immediately.

1356
01:56:12,045 --> 01:56:13,034
Haven't you yet gone to Vizag?

1357
01:56:13,213 --> 01:56:15,579
l came to say good bye.
Just for fun.

1358
01:56:15,749 --> 01:56:16,738
No, l've to go.

1359
01:56:16,916 --> 01:56:19,407
No way, come and sit.
- No, getting late to flight.

1360
01:56:19,586 --> 01:56:21,417
You too look busy.

1361
01:56:21,921 --> 01:56:23,411
lt's about Ravi's engagement.

1362
01:56:27,093 --> 01:56:28,253
l'll take leave.

1363
01:56:30,263 --> 01:56:32,060
Sir, l'll send him off.

1364
01:56:33,566 --> 01:56:34,726
How far the case has come?

1365
01:56:34,901 --> 01:56:39,235
We're serious about the case,
talked to Varadarajulu too.

1366
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:42,897
Don't underestimate Bittu,
it's good to be brave.

1367
01:56:43,076 --> 01:56:45,067
But it's wrong to be careful, right?

1368
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:48,611
Where?
- l forgot my phone.

1369
01:56:48,782 --> 01:56:52,115
One minute, l know where the phone is.
l'll get it.

1370
01:56:53,286 --> 01:56:54,776
Uncle, give the phone.

1371
01:57:24,651 --> 01:57:26,983
Which one is Ravi's family?

1372
01:57:28,321 --> 01:57:29,982
Leave me!

1373
01:57:31,991 --> 01:57:32,980
Come.

1374
01:57:34,661 --> 01:57:35,320
Come.

1375
01:57:35,495 --> 01:57:36,985
Take them quickly!

1376
01:57:37,163 --> 01:57:41,122
lf you tell anyone l'll kill you.
- Father!

1377
01:57:42,635 --> 01:57:43,294
Come.

1378
01:59:01,414 --> 01:59:07,080
Brother...brother...brother...
- Get in...

1379
01:59:16,763 --> 01:59:18,560
Brother...brother...

1380
01:59:19,732 --> 01:59:20,562
Brother!

1381
01:59:23,403 --> 01:59:24,392
Brother!

1382
02:00:23,496 --> 02:00:25,794
Father...father!

1383
02:00:26,132 --> 02:00:27,121
Father!

1384
02:00:33,306 --> 02:00:35,001
l'll kill you, bastard!

1385
02:00:37,677 --> 02:00:42,011
Hubby!
- Father!

1386
02:00:42,348 --> 02:00:44,009
How dare you fire at my father?
- Leave me...

1387
02:00:44,183 --> 02:00:48,017
Brother!
- Leave him son!

1388
02:00:48,187 --> 02:00:49,415
Father!

1389
02:00:49,689 --> 02:00:51,850
Leave me, your father is alive!

1390
02:00:52,025 --> 02:00:53,515
Call ambulance!

1391
02:01:06,005 --> 02:01:06,334
Sir, my father.

1392
02:01:06,506 --> 02:01:08,701
Don't worry, nothing will happen to him.

1393
02:01:08,875 --> 02:01:11,503
You come with me.
- Come to the station.

1394
02:01:11,711 --> 02:01:13,508
l'm talking to him, right?

1395
02:01:14,881 --> 02:01:19,215
This phone has the trigger
that set off to kill ACP.

1396
02:01:25,892 --> 02:01:28,725
They'll interrogate for formality,
go with them.

1397
02:01:28,895 --> 02:01:31,693
How can l leave my father?
- l'll take care of him. You go.

1398
02:01:49,916 --> 02:01:51,144
Where is Ravi?

1399
02:01:53,586 --> 02:01:55,747
Come, let's go to the hospital.

1400
02:01:55,922 --> 02:01:58,413
What happened, sir?
- Nothing to worry.

1401
02:01:58,591 --> 02:01:59,751
What happened to my father?

1402
02:01:59,926 --> 02:02:01,086
l said nothing to worry.

1403
02:02:01,260 --> 02:02:02,591
l can take it, sir, tell me.

1404
02:02:04,263 --> 02:02:05,560
Come with me, l'll tell you.

1405
02:02:05,732 --> 02:02:09,065
Taking as if he's in a hotel?
He's an accused.

1406
02:02:09,235 --> 02:02:11,135
l'll bring him back in an hour.
- Rules don't accept.

1407
02:02:12,405 --> 02:02:14,236
This is my station.
l'll take care of it.

1408
02:02:14,574 --> 02:02:16,405
Tell us what we should write then.

1409
02:02:20,279 --> 02:02:25,444
Write l'm taking my son on
my personal guaranty. ls it enough?

1410
02:02:26,953 --> 02:02:27,612
Come.

1411
02:02:55,314 --> 02:02:57,214
Your father wants to see you.

1412
02:02:58,317 --> 02:03:00,308
BP is highly fluctuating.

1413
02:03:01,487 --> 02:03:04,888
Don't tell him about your arrest
or Raji's kidnap.

1414
02:03:21,641 --> 02:03:28,171
Had you not taken Rs.10000 that day,
we'd be watching a film on TV at home!

1415
02:03:29,515 --> 02:03:31,915
Your mother would've made pakodis,

1416
02:03:34,020 --> 02:03:35,851
your sister would be up to some mischief.

1417
02:03:38,024 --> 02:03:39,514
That's wealth!

1418
02:03:40,693 --> 02:03:44,185
lt is 10 million times valuable
than your one lakh rupees.

1419
02:03:46,999 --> 02:03:53,871
You know the logic that train speeding
at 60 kms won't stop at platform,

1420
02:03:54,040 --> 02:03:58,374
don't know that no bank would give
Rs.1 lakh interest in 2 hours.

1421
02:03:58,678 --> 02:04:05,709
lf that really happens,
l should be in hospital at 80,

1422
02:04:05,885 --> 02:04:08,217
but your father would is
in hospital at 50.

1423
02:04:09,722 --> 02:04:12,714
lf that comes at speed,
this too comes at speed.

1424
02:04:14,727 --> 02:04:18,219
When l think l don't see much
difference between you and Bittu.

1425
02:04:20,032 --> 02:04:23,695
You want lakhs and he wants crores.

1426
02:04:23,903 --> 02:04:27,202
Difference is in numbers only
not in thoughts.

1427
02:04:28,374 --> 02:04:30,399
Father!
- Got angry?

1428
02:04:30,710 --> 02:04:31,904
Then show me!

1429
02:04:32,245 --> 02:04:34,907
You wrote a calculation in March
and failed the exam.

1430
02:04:35,081 --> 02:04:36,912
You got the same question
again in September.

1431
02:04:37,083 --> 02:04:39,415
What would you do?
What have you learnt meanwhile?

1432
02:04:40,253 --> 02:04:42,084
Show me the difference between
March and September.

1433
02:04:42,255 --> 02:04:43,415
What do you want me to do, father?

1434
02:04:43,589 --> 02:04:45,921
Dharmaraju played a game of
dice only once,

1435
02:04:46,092 --> 02:04:47,753
it ended in the battle of Kurukshetra.

1436
02:04:48,427 --> 02:04:53,729
For betting Rs.10000 one night,
you had to fight risking life.

1437
02:04:54,066 --> 02:04:56,057
Battle...go and battle.

1438
02:04:56,736 --> 02:04:59,569
l don't want just my Rs.5 lakhs!

1439
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:03,936
Like me many clerks,
teachers, supervisors,

1440
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:07,443
saved money for daughters' marriages,
sons' education,

1441
02:05:07,580 --> 02:05:10,447
and to build homes after retirement.

1442
02:05:10,616 --> 02:05:13,779
lt's hard earned money with dreams.

1443
02:05:14,453 --> 02:05:18,287
Show me...bring back Rs.1500 crores
and show me.

1444
02:05:18,791 --> 02:05:21,954
Tell me then that you're
different from Bittu.

1445
02:05:24,297 --> 02:05:25,594
l'll bring it back, father.

1446
02:05:36,442 --> 02:05:42,312
You don't worry about this case,
l'll prove you didn't kill ACP.

1447
02:05:42,648 --> 02:05:45,310
You can't.
- Why?

1448
02:05:45,484 --> 02:05:47,645
He's not dead.
- Not dead?

1449
02:05:47,820 --> 02:05:50,482
What did ACP tell on phone
when he came to your home?

1450
02:05:50,656 --> 02:05:52,317
Don't park the car,
l'll be back immediately.

1451
02:05:52,491 --> 02:05:55,153
lt means driver was in the car.

1452
02:05:56,162 --> 02:05:58,960
lf ACP had died as you think,
there must be two bodies in the car.

1453
02:05:59,131 --> 02:06:00,291
How many?
- Two!

1454
02:06:00,466 --> 02:06:02,798
How many were there?
- One!

1455
02:06:03,002 --> 02:06:05,163
Then, the dead man is...
- Driver!

1456
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:09,005
While coming out do you
know what did he say.

1457
02:06:09,175 --> 02:06:10,802
Just now talked to
Varadarajulu on phone.

1458
02:06:11,010 --> 02:06:13,501
Varadarajulu died yesterday and
he claims to have talked to him now.

1459
02:06:13,646 --> 02:06:16,012
ls Varadarajulu dead?
How do you know it?

1460
02:06:16,182 --> 02:06:18,013
We saw on TVwhile coming
out of the hospital.

1461
02:06:18,184 --> 02:06:21,347
Ex-MLA of Vizag East and
Co-operative bank Chairman,

1462
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:25,012
Paidpalli Varadarajulu was
murdered in his guest house.

1463
02:06:25,191 --> 02:06:26,852
When did Rajamanikyam get into this?

1464
02:06:27,026 --> 02:06:32,328
May be he got a clue about the money
when we were in the dump yard.

1465
02:06:38,671 --> 02:06:39,831
lf my guess is right,

1466
02:06:40,039 --> 02:06:44,373
ACP would've gone the same
night to dump yard for money.

1467
02:06:46,545 --> 02:06:48,206
l'm sure he would've seen the money.

1468
02:07:09,201 --> 02:07:14,366
As soon as Bittu comes out,
each one of us can take Rs.500 crores.

1469
02:07:14,540 --> 02:07:17,407
Let's talk to lawyer and
send Bittu permanently to jail,

1470
02:07:17,576 --> 02:07:19,237
take Rs.750 crores each.

1471
02:07:19,412 --> 02:07:22,074
But they wouldn't have expected
Bittu would escape.

1472
02:07:22,248 --> 02:07:25,740
Bittu would've come to know the
game played by ACP and Varadarajulu.

1473
02:07:26,585 --> 02:07:28,416
That's why he killed Varadarajulu.

1474
02:07:28,587 --> 02:07:30,418
Why did he leave ACP then?

1475
02:07:30,589 --> 02:07:32,580
ACP knows where the money is!

1476
02:07:33,092 --> 02:07:35,253
lf he kills him, how can he
know where the money is!

1477
02:07:36,262 --> 02:07:38,560
That's why he would've bargained with him.

1478
02:08:05,124 --> 02:08:09,117
You knew he's villain
because of bomb blast,

1479
02:08:09,295 --> 02:08:13,595
but how did Bittu come to know about
the link between ACP and Varadarajulu?

1480
02:08:13,766 --> 02:08:16,929
Bittu thinks just like l think.

1481
02:08:17,136 --> 02:08:20,128
But this time he was 24 hours
earlier than me.

1482
02:08:21,140 --> 02:08:23,768
That's why my father is in hospital.

1483
02:08:24,310 --> 02:08:25,937
And my sister is with him.

1484
02:08:26,645 --> 02:08:27,976
l'm in a lock-up.

1485
02:08:28,647 --> 02:08:30,979
But still l'll spare that bastard.

1486
02:08:31,484 --> 02:08:33,816
l'll make him bite the bullet.
- How?

1487
02:08:38,991 --> 02:08:43,758
Catch...catch...

1488
02:08:44,330 --> 02:08:48,630
Who would dare stop you?

1489
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:58,504
Settle the issue once for all...

1490
02:08:59,678 --> 02:09:04,172
Who is hiding behind the mask?
Find him quickly...

1491
02:09:04,350 --> 02:09:06,511
Leave behind your worries,
break the barricades...

1492
02:09:06,685 --> 02:09:09,347
Unmask them...

1493
02:09:09,522 --> 02:09:14,186
Are you one of the four
or one in a crore?

1494
02:09:14,360 --> 02:09:16,692
Rip out the mystery face
behind the shadowy mask...

1495
02:09:16,862 --> 02:09:19,330
Settle all the accounts...

1496
02:09:19,498 --> 02:09:24,367
Brother of Vikramarka
in determination...

1497
02:09:24,503 --> 02:09:26,994
Take them to task...

1498
02:09:27,373 --> 02:09:30,206
Catch him...catch him...

1499
02:10:02,575 --> 02:10:04,736
Rs.1500 crores!

1500
02:10:08,080 --> 02:10:09,240
You'll not forget my Rs.750 crores, right?

1501
02:10:09,415 --> 02:10:10,575
Take it right now.

1502
02:10:21,260 --> 02:10:24,923
He asks money and when given
doesn't know how to take it.

1503
02:10:29,568 --> 02:10:31,263
Looking at him
l understood one thing,

1504
02:10:31,737 --> 02:10:35,901
not only earning money is difficult
but carrying so too difficult.

1505
02:10:44,283 --> 02:10:45,272
ls he dead?

1506
02:10:51,290 --> 02:10:52,279
Call Bittu!

1507
02:11:02,434 --> 02:11:04,459
Why is he calling at this hour?

1508
02:11:04,603 --> 02:11:07,094
He's not calling
someone has made him call.

1509
02:11:10,109 --> 02:11:11,804
Fix three containers.

1510
02:11:12,478 --> 02:11:14,139
Load one of them with money.

1511
02:11:18,317 --> 02:11:20,717
Before they find out which
container has money...

1512
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:27,985
We can board a ship and
leave the country.

1513
02:11:28,160 --> 02:11:28,649
You?

1514
02:11:28,827 --> 02:11:32,456
There's an airport Tuticorin
in the Southern end of lndia,

1515
02:11:33,132 --> 02:11:34,463
Strange name, right?

1516
02:11:35,467 --> 02:11:37,958
Srilanka is just 10 minutes from there.

1517
02:11:38,637 --> 02:11:41,037
You come in the ship along with money.

1518
02:11:41,507 --> 02:11:44,738
l'll come in the flight.
- What about her?

1519
02:11:48,180 --> 02:11:50,011
Devayani will handle her.

1520
02:11:52,184 --> 02:11:54,675
The phone call he made went to
Vizag lndustrial area godowns.

1521
02:11:54,853 --> 02:11:57,686
lf he had picked the call,
we could trace the exact location.

1522
02:11:58,524 --> 02:11:59,513
We must go to Vizag immediately.

1523
02:11:59,692 --> 02:12:03,355
Vizag? We'll reach by midnight
even if we rush.- Yes.

1524
02:12:03,529 --> 02:12:05,156
He would've left the country by then.

1525
02:12:05,331 --> 02:12:07,822
Let's take a helicopter.
- Helicopter? Are you mad?

1526
02:12:09,501 --> 02:12:14,666
When robbers can use flights and ships,
can't we police use helicopters?

1527
02:12:14,840 --> 02:12:16,364
They'll not allow us into airport too.

1528
02:12:16,542 --> 02:12:18,009
They will!
- Who?

1529
02:12:18,177 --> 02:12:19,371
Your future son-in-law!

1530
02:12:20,179 --> 02:12:21,009
He's a pilot, right?

1531
02:12:21,213 --> 02:12:25,206
l've already fixed her marriage.
Groom is a pilot.

1532
02:12:25,384 --> 02:12:27,375
Why would he give us?
- l'll talk to him.

1533
02:12:27,553 --> 02:12:28,542
Like this?

1534
02:12:30,723 --> 02:12:31,712
l'll beg him.

1535
02:12:32,224 --> 02:12:33,885
lf necessary l'll fall at his feet.

1536
02:12:34,560 --> 02:12:37,723
Begumpet Airport, Hyderabad
- How dare you beat me!

1537
02:12:38,063 --> 02:12:40,691
l don't have any connection
with this incident.

1538
02:12:40,866 --> 02:12:43,027
Will you please talk to my
daughter. lt'll ease your pin.

1539
02:12:43,202 --> 02:12:45,397
lf you talk about your daughter
again, l'll kill you.

1540
02:12:46,205 --> 02:12:48,730
Are you happy now?
Marriage was also fixed.

1541
02:12:48,874 --> 02:12:49,863
You spoilt it.

1542
02:12:50,042 --> 02:12:52,203
Why do you feel so much?
Does he own the helicopter?

1543
02:12:52,411 --> 02:12:53,571
He's just a driver.

1544
02:12:53,746 --> 02:12:55,805
Shut up! Enough of what
you'd already done.

1545
02:13:25,778 --> 02:13:27,245
Where are we to search for them?

1546
02:13:27,446 --> 02:13:29,607
Search the road from
industrial area to port.

1547
02:13:29,782 --> 02:13:30,771
Which vehicles?

1548
02:13:30,949 --> 02:13:33,782
Only containers can carry
so much cash. Look there!

1549
02:13:37,623 --> 02:13:38,612
Three vehicles are there!

1550
02:13:38,791 --> 02:13:40,952
Which one of the three has money?

1551
02:13:41,126 --> 02:13:43,959
Simple sir,
the one carrying money has weight,

1552
02:13:44,129 --> 02:13:45,426
it's tyres would get pressed!

1553
02:13:47,099 --> 02:13:48,760
Orange one has money!

1554
02:13:48,934 --> 02:13:50,094
Tell me where it is heading!

1555
02:13:50,269 --> 02:13:52,100
l'll tell you what to do
after getting down.

1556
02:13:52,471 --> 02:13:53,938
Your sister is with him.

1557
02:13:54,106 --> 02:13:57,098
He won't harm my sister till
money reaches port.

1558
02:14:01,113 --> 02:14:03,138
A helicopter is landing!

1559
02:14:13,659 --> 02:14:15,490
Can you hear me, sir?
- Tell me, Ravi.

1560
02:14:15,661 --> 02:14:17,151
Follow the orange vehicle, sir.
- Just a minute.

1561
02:14:17,329 --> 02:14:18,819
Got it.
- Where is it heading?

1562
02:14:21,300 --> 02:14:23,131
East!
- Who is the driver?

1563
02:14:26,138 --> 02:14:28,504
l'm sure the money is in that vehicle.
Don't leave him.

1564
02:14:29,675 --> 02:14:31,666
How would you stop him from
reaching the port?

1565
02:14:33,312 --> 02:14:34,506
Leave it to me.

1566
02:14:44,022 --> 02:14:45,683
Where are you?
- On beach road.

1567
02:14:45,858 --> 02:14:46,847
Where exactly?

1568
02:14:47,025 --> 02:14:47,855
My bike is broken down.

1569
02:14:48,026 --> 02:14:50,187
l'm climbing the steep of St.Anns!
- Listen carefully.

1570
02:14:50,362 --> 02:14:53,661
Go immediately and ring the
final bell in St.Alphonse school.- Why?

1571
02:14:53,832 --> 02:14:55,231
Just follow my order!

1572
02:14:57,169 --> 02:14:59,535
Has orange colour container
reached the pace?- lt has!

1573
02:14:59,705 --> 02:15:00,535
Children are crossing the road.

1574
02:15:00,706 --> 02:15:02,537
Road is blocked and
vehicle has stopped.

1575
02:15:03,175 --> 02:15:04,699
Fast!- lt's reversing!

1576
02:15:05,177 --> 02:15:07,543
lt is taking right.
- lt's going towards MPS side.

1577
02:15:08,547 --> 02:15:09,878
Who is that side?

1578
02:15:10,048 --> 02:15:12,209
Padhu has gone there to
get his car repaired.

1579
02:15:12,384 --> 02:15:14,215
Call him, he's there only.

1580
02:15:20,726 --> 02:15:22,057
Who is right before you?

1581
02:15:22,227 --> 02:15:24,388
Buddy, he looks like a wrestler!

1582
02:15:24,563 --> 02:15:26,861
What are you doing?
- Having tea.

1583
02:15:27,032 --> 02:15:28,863
Throw it on his face!
- May lead to fight!

1584
02:15:29,034 --> 02:15:30,365
Throw it on his face!

1585
02:15:32,738 --> 02:15:34,205
How dare you throw tea on my face!

1586
02:15:43,749 --> 02:15:46,741
People are beating up each other
for throwing tea on face!

1587
02:15:46,919 --> 02:15:48,750
Send additional force immediately.

1588
02:15:48,921 --> 02:15:50,252
ls the vehicle taking right or left?

1589
02:15:50,422 --> 02:15:53,414
lt is taking the right side.
- Sure?- Yes

1590
02:15:57,262 --> 02:16:00,561
He's going very fast,
he'll reach the flyover in 10 minutes.

1591
02:16:00,732 --> 02:16:03,394
lf he gets into the flyover,
he'll reach the port directly.

1592
02:16:03,602 --> 02:16:05,763
Stop him!
- He won't reach.

1593
02:16:06,772 --> 02:16:08,603
Always hearing radio Mirchi?

1594
02:16:09,241 --> 02:16:12,233
My will and wish, l'll listen that only.

1595
02:16:18,450 --> 02:16:19,781
Where are you?
- ln studio.

1596
02:16:19,952 --> 02:16:22,614
Say there's traffic jam
on flyover leading to port.

1597
02:16:22,788 --> 02:16:23,447
But that road is free, right?

1598
02:16:23,789 --> 02:16:25,279
Didn't you ever tell a lie?

1599
02:16:26,458 --> 02:16:27,789
Traffic update to listeners,

1600
02:16:27,960 --> 02:16:29,621
traffic is little heavy
on flyover to harbour,

1601
02:16:29,795 --> 02:16:33,754
if possible try to avoid it,
if not wait in the traffic,

1602
02:16:33,932 --> 02:16:35,627
listening to the super hit song.

1603
02:16:41,974 --> 02:16:44,636
He has taken a U-turn to right.

1604
02:16:49,481 --> 02:16:50,470
Where are you taking him?

1605
02:16:50,649 --> 02:16:52,810
lt'll keep on roaming till
Bittu is finished.

1606
02:16:52,985 --> 02:16:55,977
Though he has the steering,
he'll drive as l command.

1607
02:16:59,491 --> 02:17:00,480
Take right!

1608
02:17:02,494 --> 02:17:03,483
Right again!

1609
02:17:10,669 --> 02:17:13,968
Depositors Relay Fast

1610
02:17:23,348 --> 02:17:24,406
Have we reached the port?

1611
02:17:51,043 --> 02:17:53,034
Depositors Relay Fast
40th day

1612
02:17:56,715 --> 02:17:59,445
You made them bring it to the
place from where they stole!

1613
02:18:03,889 --> 02:18:08,053
Catch him!

1614
02:18:12,364 --> 02:18:14,855
Hey Stop!...

1615
02:18:26,912 --> 02:18:29,244
Rs.1500 crores!

1616
02:18:29,915 --> 02:18:32,748
Didn't let you take even a rupee!

1617
02:18:33,418 --> 02:18:35,409
Coming, l'm coming to you!

1618
02:18:36,922 --> 02:18:38,253
Where are you going, Ravi?

1619
02:18:38,423 --> 02:18:41,915
Bittu would be heading to port,
l'll meet you after killing him.

1620
02:18:45,263 --> 02:18:46,787
Go to the port!

1621
02:18:47,733 --> 02:18:50,065
This is not an auto to turn
as you say!

1622
02:18:54,573 --> 02:18:55,232
Go!

1623
02:18:56,942 --> 02:18:59,274
Bittu, your man hasn't come yet.

1624
02:19:01,613 --> 02:19:02,841
l'm coming there.

1625
02:20:03,642 --> 02:20:04,836
How could you do that?

1626
02:20:16,521 --> 02:20:17,010
Like this!

1627
02:21:09,241 --> 02:21:10,708
Kill him...

1628
02:21:14,546 --> 02:21:16,241
Will you kill me and
help him to get down?

1629
02:21:17,082 --> 02:21:18,242
l'm his fan!

1630
02:21:18,750 --> 02:21:20,581
He must always be on top!

1631
02:21:24,089 --> 02:21:26,421
Come...come...come...

1632
02:22:41,132 --> 02:22:44,067
Come... Come...

1633
02:22:46,171 --> 02:22:47,297
Feeling breathlessness!

1634
02:22:52,644 --> 02:22:54,009
He has Asthma too!

1635
02:23:00,018 --> 02:23:04,682
Will you kill?
Don't you care about human life?

1636
02:23:04,856 --> 02:23:08,849
lntelligent like us mustn't fight.
We must discuss.

1637
02:23:12,364 --> 02:23:13,831
You can kill him.

1638
02:23:20,038 --> 02:23:23,030
Leave it, do as you like it.

1639
02:23:23,842 --> 02:23:24,740
Stop!

1640
02:23:28,213 --> 02:23:31,376
l said let's discuss,
why did you shoot me?

1641
02:23:32,550 --> 02:23:35,542
Leave me...leave me.

1642
02:23:35,720 --> 02:23:39,554
l'll tell you where your sister is!
- No, don't tell!

1643
02:23:40,058 --> 02:23:44,552
Don't provoke me, if l get angry...

1644
02:23:44,729 --> 02:23:48,187
When the first light of the
Vizag is switched on,

1645
02:23:48,366 --> 02:23:50,061
l'll kill your sister.

1646
02:23:52,370 --> 02:23:53,064
Kill her!

1647
02:23:53,238 --> 02:23:55,536
Have you gone mad?
l'll really kill her.

1648
02:23:55,707 --> 02:23:58,870
Will you kill her?
Come on kill her!

1649
02:23:59,577 --> 02:24:03,911
Even a thief like me got
angry for losing brother.

1650
02:24:04,082 --> 02:24:06,573
She's your sister!
- So what?

1651
02:24:06,918 --> 02:24:09,751
Don't you've sentiments?
- No! l'm a beast,

1652
02:24:09,921 --> 02:24:12,253
l'll eat when l'm hungry.
lf l get angry l'll kill!

1653
02:24:16,928 --> 02:24:18,589
Did you get him?

1654
02:24:19,898 --> 02:24:21,388
Please save me!

1655
02:24:21,566 --> 02:24:24,228
Got him...got him...stop...
- Please save me.

1656
02:24:24,402 --> 02:24:27,735
Please save me sir,
he may kill me.

1657
02:24:29,107 --> 02:24:31,098
l forgot to bring handcuffs.

1658
02:24:31,276 --> 02:24:34,109
Rubber band is enough!
l'll not run away!

1659
02:24:34,279 --> 02:24:36,941
No need to put him jail
like keeping trash in a locker.

1660
02:24:37,115 --> 02:24:39,777
Jail costume, omelette on Sunday,
biryani on Wednesday,

1661
02:24:39,951 --> 02:24:42,784
Govt. would lose money.
- l'm pure vegetarian, sir.

1662
02:24:42,954 --> 02:24:44,615
lf you kill him,
you'll get into trouble.

1663
02:24:44,789 --> 02:24:46,450
l'll get into trouble
only if his body is found.

1664
02:24:46,624 --> 02:24:48,956
Let's bury him, no one would
know other than us.

1665
02:24:51,463 --> 02:24:52,589
Why are you looking at me?

1666
02:24:56,601 --> 02:24:58,125
Let's finish him too!

1667
02:24:58,603 --> 02:24:59,934
One bullet two bodies!

1668
02:25:00,939 --> 02:25:03,772
Don't think sir,
l'll get better proposals than him.

1669
02:25:03,942 --> 02:25:06,934
He's a mad dog.
- How dare you call me a dog!

1670
02:25:07,145 --> 02:25:10,546
lf you say so l'll kill you like a dog.
l'm not used to guns too!

1671
02:25:10,982 --> 02:25:13,883
lt's not an achievement for you
to kill him, it should not be.

1672
02:25:14,319 --> 02:25:15,149
Leave me for once, l'll kill him.

1673
02:25:15,320 --> 02:25:18,653
l'm telling considering you as
my eldest son, listen to me.

1674
02:25:18,823 --> 02:25:19,983
Drop the gun!

1675
02:25:24,329 --> 02:25:27,457
Rogues like him have no rules.
Only good people have all the rules.

1676
02:25:27,632 --> 02:25:29,156
No Ravi!

1677
02:25:43,014 --> 02:25:44,504
lndeed it is an achievement
for me to kill him!

1678
02:25:44,682 --> 02:25:48,846
You're right,
criminals like him mustn't live.

1679
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:50,351
He would've shot you.

1680
02:25:50,522 --> 02:25:54,356
No way, to shoot his gun
must have bullets, right?

1681
02:25:55,360 --> 02:25:58,193
You mean his gun...?
- Empty!

1682
02:25:59,831 --> 02:26:01,822
Did you play the drama
with an empty gun?

1683
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:04,992
Did you expect me to kill him
and go to jail? No way sir!

1684
02:26:05,503 --> 02:26:07,368
Where are you going now?
- To my sister.

1685
02:26:13,711 --> 02:26:16,043
May be she'll harm your sister
hearing the sound of helicopter.

1686
02:26:16,214 --> 02:26:18,205
No sir, she's deaf and mute.
She can't hear.

1687
02:26:40,705 --> 02:26:42,036
Hold this, don't eat!

1688
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:56,909
Raji, it's me!

1689
02:26:57,088 --> 02:27:00,080
Why did you hand over me to the girl?

1690
02:27:00,258 --> 02:27:01,748
ls she bothered about hand only?

1691
02:27:01,926 --> 02:27:04,087
lsn't she bothered about
whose hand it is?

1692
02:27:06,397 --> 02:27:08,058
Why are you beating me?
- Why are you laughing?

1693
02:27:08,233 --> 02:27:10,258
l took so much risk for you, she devil!

1694
02:27:10,401 --> 02:27:12,062
Why did you take so much time?

1695
02:27:13,905 --> 02:27:15,270
She has a gun too!

1696
02:27:21,279 --> 02:27:22,610
Did you eat the peanuts
or keeping with you?

1697
02:27:22,780 --> 02:27:25,943
ls it time to eat peanuts? Fool!

1698
02:27:26,117 --> 02:27:27,948
Throw the peanuts on her face!

1699
02:27:28,953 --> 02:27:29,942
Hold her hand with the gun.

1700
02:27:30,121 --> 02:27:33,955
She's not leaving it.
- Give her a tight punch!

1701
02:27:36,461 --> 02:27:37,621
Are you still there, sir?

1702
02:27:37,795 --> 02:27:40,263
Did you study astrology?

1703
02:27:40,431 --> 02:27:44,094
How did you know your sister is here?
- He told me.

1704
02:27:44,302 --> 02:27:49,467
When the first light of Vizag is
switched on, l'll kill your sister.

1705
02:27:50,475 --> 02:27:52,807
First lamp to be switched on
in Vizag is...

1706
02:27:54,479 --> 02:27:55,309
...lighthouse!

1707
02:28:02,487 --> 02:28:04,648
How could you guess it
in so much tension?

1708
02:28:04,822 --> 02:28:06,813
Anyone can answer while in class.

1709
02:28:06,991 --> 02:28:10,051
Only the one who writes in exam
would be the topper.

1710
02:28:13,464 --> 02:28:15,455
Going to attend interview?

1711
02:28:15,633 --> 02:28:16,793
How much would you get?

1712
02:28:17,135 --> 02:28:18,329
lf l get the job, it's Rs.25000.

1713
02:28:19,971 --> 02:28:22,030
How much time would it
take to earn a lakh?

1714
02:28:22,974 --> 02:28:24,134
4 months!

1715
02:28:24,976 --> 02:28:26,967
What would happen if you earn
a lakh in two hours?

1716
02:28:28,846 --> 02:28:31,337
l'll face problems, father.
- Good! Go!

1717
02:28:33,685 --> 02:28:34,845
You gave me Rs.5000, right?

1718
02:28:35,019 --> 02:28:37,510
Watch out l'll make it
Rs.50000 in an hour.

1719
02:28:38,523 --> 02:28:40,684
Did they give Rs.5000?
- Yes.

1720
02:28:40,858 --> 02:28:41,847
They will give.

1721
02:28:42,026 --> 02:28:44,017
lf you take it, you'll lose your skin!

1722
02:28:44,195 --> 02:28:46,163
Listen to me,
return the money to them.

1723
02:28:46,331 --> 02:28:48,993
Take Rs.100, evening go to watch a film.
You'll come good in life.

1724
02:28:56,007 --> 02:28:57,998
l'm unable to travel in bus.

1725
02:28:58,176 --> 02:29:01,543
Please buy me a Scooty
immediately after our marriage.

1726
02:29:01,713 --> 02:29:02,702
There's a match today evening,

1727
02:29:02,880 --> 02:29:04,541
l go to bet without
attending the interview.

1728
02:29:04,716 --> 02:29:06,707
l'll buy you a car
not just a Scooty!

1729
02:29:06,884 --> 02:29:10,376
No please, l'm ready to walk
to my office.

1730
02:29:10,555 --> 02:29:11,886
You please attend the interview.

1731
02:29:17,562 --> 02:29:19,553
...like that Prince

1732
02:29:19,731 --> 02:29:21,028
and distributed the
treasure to people,

1733
02:29:21,199 --> 02:29:22,689
and was returning to his kingdom,

1734
02:29:22,867 --> 02:29:27,861

Akashavani Vizag Kendra.
