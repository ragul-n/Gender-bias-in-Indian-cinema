1
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:43,120
Not fathered by the Sun
Nor witnessed by the Moon

2
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,560
Not fathered by the Sun
Nor witnessed by the Moon

3
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:02,740
Born to a forsaken woman, this child
Fed and grew on famine, this child

4
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,950
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

5
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:20,320
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

6
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,230
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

7
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:43,140
There's the big old banyan tree
Perched upon its tallest branch

8
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:52,950
There's the big old banyan tree
Perched upon its tallest branch

9
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:03,200
Though it is all alone
The lone parakeet sings his name

10
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:13,770
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

11
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:20,410
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

12
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:27,790
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

13
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,390
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

14
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,100
All these countless temples
In the village

15
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:42,200
All these countless Gods in temples

16
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,270
KARNAN

17
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,270
All these countless temples
In the village

18
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,980
All these countless Gods in temples

19
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:57,820
And not one idol of him
But he's one among my family

20
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,730
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

21
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,370
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

22
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,310
PODIYANKULAM INCIDENT
YOUNG MAN, KARNAN, JAILED!

23
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,620
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

24
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,030
Never laid eyes on an armour
Nor adorned any ornaments either

25
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:40,390
KARNAN

26
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:49,040
How he wielded that sword!
None of his foes survived

27
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:57,780
How he wielded that sword!
None of his foes survived

28
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:12,190
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

29
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,730
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

30
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:25,610
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

31
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,810
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

32
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,320
If you see him, tell him to come
Somebody fetch Karnan at once

33
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,120
Karna!

34
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:49,760
KARNAN

35
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,810
BEFORE 1997

36
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,220
He wants to see you..

37
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,450
Oh, no!
Catch it...

38
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,620
It took my chick! My chick!
Kids, hurry up.

39
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,590
Mom!

40
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,560
Mom, be careful.

41
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,430
Didn't I tell you to wake me up
to go to the pond?

42
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,700
How was I to know?
I thought you wouldn't go.

43
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,770
You didn't wake me up
on purpose, you liar.

44
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,670
What's your mother running for?

45
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,200
The thieving eagle has
snatched a chick.

46
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,070
Your mother's gone to see it.

47
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,310
Every day it snatches a chick
and eats it.

48
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:10,480
And we beg and plead to return.

49
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,820
-Did Yeman come by?
-No.

50
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,490
I wonder where the fool's gone.

51
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,520
Where's my shirt?

52
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,860
Oh, look.

53
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
Get up... up!

54
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:26,730
You've hidden it under your bum!

55
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,400
Hey, Karnan.

56
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,030
Didn't I tell you to come
and wake me up early?

57
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Don't be angry. Sit.

58
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,900
We're late, step on it.

59
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,740
But you haven't eaten!

60
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,740
Stop. Where are you headed
before breakfast?

61
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,410
I'll whack you! You stomped over me
when I was asleep, cut the act.

62
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,210
Just go to see the fish get cut
and return like a good lad.

63
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,180
If you try to cut the fish,
I will slaughter you.

64
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,520
-Let's go.
-Mind him, Uncle.

65
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,450
Return my precious chick to me.
Please it's a poor little one.

66
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,490
It's going to eat the chick
and they still gather to worship it.

67
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,030
-Oh, shut up.
-How did they not invite you?

68
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,400
I heard even Duryodanan didn't go.
He's building a temple, it seems.

69
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,760
Why would they call me?

70
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,670
Why didn't he go?

71
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,770
What's the point?

72
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:08,040
No one will cut the fish this year anyway.

73
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:10,470
They'll only stand by and watch.
He's upset about that.

74
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,740
Why is everyone so afraid to cut it?

75
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,040
The last few times the fish was cut,
there was death in the village.

76
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,910
Everyone's scared about that.

77
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,450
But we can't just leave the sword lying.

78
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,680
So we perform a customary prayer
and put it back inside.

79
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,420
-Should I cut it this year?
-You?

80
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,160
So your mother can kill me?

81
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,390
Forget all that.
Can I cut it or not?

82
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,690
-You can, but...
-Then let's go.

83
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,360
Are you being serious?

84
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,400
Yes, step on it.

85
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:42,440
Wow. This must weigh
about 5 kilos?

86
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,870
-Shall we rub vermilion, then?
-Hold on.

87
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,940
First, ask if anybody
wishes to cut it.

88
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,410
Do you see one face that seems interested?
They are only here to watch.

89
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,150
Were you seriously counting on them?

90
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,280
Is anybody interested,
or shall I toss it in the water?

91
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,750
I think they've already
tossed it in!

92
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:59,090
If you don't want to cut it, be quiet.
Are you trying to pick a fight?

93
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,360
Let's get it over with,
I need to open my shop.

94
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,160
Such cowards. Will it be
vermilion again this year?

95
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,390
Another wasted year.

96
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:09,100
And they get upset when
the elephant doesn't have tusks.

97
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,700
Change the rules, then.

98
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,340
He who fails to cut the fish mid-air
will get his head tonsured in public.

99
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,400
No young man will step up.
Why should he?

100
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,580
-A pointless expense year after year.
-Oh, yeah.

101
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,940
It takes gall to wield
the village sword, you know?

102
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,450
-Is that so?
-Why don't you cut it then?

103
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,120
This "gall" has led to the sword
lying unwielded for 8 years.

104
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,850
-Then you cut it.
-No, you cut it.

105
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,090
You do it!

106
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Hurry!

107
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,390
I'll kill you
if they toss the fish in.

108
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,890
-Vadamalayan, calm down.
-Stop!

109
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:39,360
Stop...
Hey, stop.

110
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,700
Not vermilion,
rub turmeric on it.

111
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,730
-Are you going to cut it?
-Not me.

112
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,600
Someone is coming to cut it.

113
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:50,440
Grandpa, this is not a joking matter
for you both to pull your antics.

114
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,640
If he fails to cut it, his head
will be tonsured in public.

115
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,310
Only if he fails to cut it.

116
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,580
Brother, it's not enough
to just brush against it.

117
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,280
One clean strike, it must fall down
as two halves.

118
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,620
Where is the sword?

119
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,150
Well said!

120
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:05,650
Bring the sword!

121
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,620
Karnan, the sword is nice and sharp.

122
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,590
Just one hard strike...

123
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,190
and you can even cut an elephant.
A fish is child's play.

124
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,690
Here you go.

125
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,360
Go.

126
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,760
Make way...

127
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:10,180
You took my chick though
I pleaded with you.

128
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,590
Someone will come to clip your wings.

129
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,020
And he will beat you to death.

130
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,580
Hit those drums, People.
What are you waiting for?

131
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,680
-We have begun. Hit it!
-Yes!

132
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:45,850
Hit it so hard, that the very Gods
descend to cut the fish.

133
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,350
Hit it, hit it!

134
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,530
Hit it!

135
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,230
Hit it!

136
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,560
Hey, toss it.

137
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Toss it, man.

138
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Karnan, you mustn't miss it!

139
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,240
Duryodanan, he cut the fish!

140
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:40,940
-Who?
-Our boy, Karnan!

141
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:41,980
Into two?

142
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,040
One clean strike,
and two proper pieces.

143
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:55,560
-Hey, Padmini!
-What happened, Grandma?

144
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,190
Your little brother cut the fish
and mounted the elephant.

145
00:15:58,330 --> 00:16:01,530
Mom, it was Karnan who cut the fish,
and he's mounted the elephant!

146
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,430
Let's go.

147
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,500
The boy disobeyed me
and went to cut the fish!

148
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:07,100
-Wait till I see him--
-Stop whining.

149
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,000
I just said he cut the fish
and mounted the elephant!

150
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,310
He managed to cut the fish.
So stop shouting.

151
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,240
Come on, Mom.

152
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,480
-Stop your vehicles.
-Don't block the road!

153
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,950
Come on!
Dance.

154
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,320
Grandpa, what are you doing?
You will get us in trouble.

155
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,820
Would it kill them to wait for once?

156
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,560
Hey, watch it, man.

157
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,060
Sorry, sir.
There is a crowd.

158
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,270
Panneer, go take a look.

159
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,230
Dance!

160
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,870
Karnan, get down and dance.

161
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,900
You dance!

162
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,570
Oh, just come down!

163
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,110
Wait, don't pull me down.
I'll come.

164
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,080
Come on, come on.

165
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,640
Yeah, hit it!

166
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,480
Vadamalayan, don't just stand there.
Dance!

167
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,050
Sir...

168
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:02,560
-Sir!
-What?

169
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,390
Looks like some festival.
They're dancing around an elephant.

170
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,790
Has to be the Podiyankulam folks.

171
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:12,370
They cause such mayhem with that
village sword they bought themselves.

172
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,900
What do we do with them?

173
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:17,440
They were once so scared of us.
Now they dance around elephants?

174
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,440
They've gotten too cocky.

175
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,910
-There's a village here?
-Oh, yes.

176
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,940
It's called Podiyankulam.

177
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,310
About a kilometer from here.

178
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,850
They don't even have a bus stop.

179
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,020
They must go to neighbouring Melur
to even board a bus.

180
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:37,490
So when these nobodies put on
such shows with elephants...

181
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,130
naturally, it irks the Melur folks.

182
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:41,860
Every time these people use their
bus stop, there's a brawl.

183
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,430
-What the hell?
-Not again.

184
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,070
Always at loggerheads.

185
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,900
You were in my way,
you were asking for it.

186
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,570
Why, sir? The two villages
don't get along?

187
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,910
Don't even ask.
Where do I begin?

188
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,110
They fight like cats and dogs.

189
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,810
They have no idea why they're
fighting and hurting each other.

190
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,320
And we are stuck in the middle.

191
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,520
So where do they
board the bus?

192
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,090
Where else?

193
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,690
They walk pillar to post
begging for their own bus stop,

194
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,390
refusing to use
Melur's bus stop.

195
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,700
But who gives two hoots
about these people? Not a soul.

196
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,770
Hey, flag him.

197
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,170
Left with no other choice,
they come and wait here in vain...

198
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,740
and hitch a ride
with a lorry or a van.

199
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,310
Sir, are they blocking the roads
and dancing in revenge?

200
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,310
Yes, savages.

201
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,520
Why else?

202
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:40,890
Let's go.

203
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,120
Leave.

204
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,490
You want the traffic waiting
so you can dance? Move!

205
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,760
Aren't you a bit old for this?
Get out of here.

206
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,700
-Vehicles are waiting. Move!
-Yes, sure.

207
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,500
Let's move it, people.
Yes, sir. We're leaving.

208
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,940
Let's just go.

209
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,110
We're leaving, sir!
Let's go!

210
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,910
That's enough.
Let's go.

211
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,650
Bloody paupers can't ride on buses,
but they dance on elephants!

212
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,950
Draupadi!

213
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,120
Draupadi! Open up, girl!

214
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,820
Come in.

215
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,490
-I've been knocking for ages.
-Calm down.

216
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,790
So who cut the fish?

217
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,890
You don't know?
Why are you dancing then?

218
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,500
I do know. But tell me anyway.
I want to hear it.

219
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,700
Karnan.

220
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,530
That's why I asked.

221
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,400
Alright, that's enough dancing.
The procession is here, let's go.

222
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,110
-Okay...
-Hurry up!

223
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,440
-Gosh, stop ogling!
-Why do you care?

224
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:39,570
Just tell him, then.

225
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,240
It's not like I told you.
Didn't you find out by yourself?

226
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,580
Let him find out for himself.

227
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,050
And if he doesn't find out?

228
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,510
I will make him find out.

229
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,520
Go away!

230
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:01,860
Go to the shop.

231
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:03,560
Go ahead, Brother. I'll come.

232
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,930
Can't you see I am watching?

233
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,940
Hit it!

234
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:14,780
That's enough dancing.
Give him the sword.

235
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,740
What?

236
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,040
-Here.
-Give it to my father.

237
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,810
-Your father?
-You hand it to him.

238
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,090
Here, your son wanted
you to have it.

239
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,550
-Give it to his mother.
-I can't give it to a woman!

240
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:30,560
She looks so pissed.
You give it to her.

241
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:34,830
Here you go!

242
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,760
Your son sent his sword.

243
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,200
Why should I take it?
He can keep it.

244
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:41,030
Just take it, Lady.
The sword is yours now.

245
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,600
Hold it up!

246
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,720
Dad, hurry up.
It's getting late.

247
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,230
I'm coming, dear.

248
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,400
He can eat on his own.
Leave now, you're getting late.

249
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,260
Take your bag.

250
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:15,340
Poyilal's father, don't wait at
our village junction.

251
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,540
The buses won't stop here.

252
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,140
-Just walk to the Melur stop.
-That's where we're going, Mom.

253
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,970
-We're off, then.
-Keep our daughter safe!

254
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,310
-Yes, dear.
-Be careful.

255
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,820
Stop romping around like a child.

256
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,520
Kittan, where's your father gone?

257
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,060
I don't know, Brother.

258
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,720
Look at that!

259
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,060
Brother Malukkan...

260
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,560
where did you get the horse?

261
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,660
It was at Saibu's house in Vallanaadu.

262
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:44,030
The boy saw it and started crying,
saying he wanted it.

263
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,000
Saibu said, "You take it, Malukkan,"
and I did.

264
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:48,540
-What will you do with a horse?
-I'll raise it.

265
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,270
-Huh?
-I will raise it.

266
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:53,270
Raise it and do what?
No one here eats horse meat.

267
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:56,410
My horse is not for meat!
I will crack your skull open.

268
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,640
Get lost.

269
00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,150
-Oh, I'm sure you'll crack my skull open.
-Touch my horse and you'll see.

270
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,450
Look, Poyilal.

271
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,320
It's your first day of college.
I am very happy that you're going.

272
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,820
But this is not our village,
and we must board the bus from here.

273
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,660
These men are trouble.

274
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,230
They talk rubbish.

275
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,700
Just act like you don't hear it
and carry on. Okay?

276
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,030
Your father won't be able to
accompany you every day, dear.

277
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:20,000
-So you'll have to be wary...
-I'll be fine, Dad.

278
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:21,030
Okay, dear?

279
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,870
When you were harvesting greens

280
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,910
When I saw you for the first time

281
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,280
Aren't you going to listen to me?

282
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,080
She's good looking!

283
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,750
You are so hot, girl

284
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,090
We should have come
a little earlier, eh?

285
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,390
I feel a little wild...

286
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,260
Dear, it's late. Maybe Ganapathy Bus
has left already?

287
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,830
If we'd come earlier, we could have
caught Ganapathy Bus?

288
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Hopefully, we will
catch the Kattabomman Bus.

289
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:58,940
I don't see any bus in sight.
Should have waited at our junction.

290
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,810
Wait, dear.

291
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,420
Dad!

292
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,520
Just wait, dear.

293
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,190
Why would you draw such a thing?

294
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,660
This is my village bus stop.
I'll do what I want. What's it to you?

295
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,490
So you won't let girls
ride the bus in peace?

296
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,690
-Dad!
-Wait, dear.

297
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:23,830
Why let your girl sit there
when we men are out here?

298
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,600
Obviously, he's brought her here
for our pleasure, man.

299
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:27,670
-What?
-Dad!

300
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,870
That's my daughter
you are talking about.

301
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,410
-Did you dare to raise your arm at me?
-No, Brother!

302
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,370
Please spare my dad, Brothers.

303
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,480
Break his leg!

304
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,710
-Dad! Dad!
-Get away, child.

305
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,110
-Please let him go, Brother.
-Don't touch my daughter!

306
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,080
What the hell?

307
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,950
-Stop!
-Stand back, dear.

308
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,620
You'll never board a bus again.

309
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:46,650
What the hell are you doing?

310
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,220
Please let my father go.

311
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,620
-Go away!
-Don't hurt him.

312
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,390
-Listen to me, stop...
-Dad!

313
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,130
He dares to raise his arm?
This is our village.

314
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,560
Dad, please let's just go.

315
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,160
Just go back to your village.

316
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,430
-Come at me now.
-Just go to your village.

317
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,570
"It's our bus stand," he says.

318
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:05,570
-I'm taking my daughter to college.
-Just go back to your village.

319
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,710
This is so typical of you.

320
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,740
-Can't she go another day?
-It's her first day.

321
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:10,380
-Board a bus elsewhere.
-No, I can't.

322
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,250
Stay here any longer
and you'll get killed.

323
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,350
-Go!
-I don't even want to go to college, Dad.

324
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:17,450
-It's bound to happen someday.
-Get out of here.

325
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,090
-Go!
-Please listen to me, Dad.

326
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,110
Shoo them away.

327
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,310
Whose cattle are these,
blocking the way?

328
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:21,680
Who's that?

329
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,450
Look over there, Kumar!
Who is that?

330
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,850
Get him!

331
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,200
Hey!

332
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,500
Who the hell are you, man?

333
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,240
If you're such a tough guy,
show me your face.

334
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,230
-No.
-We somehow rise from our numerous falls,

335
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,830
cover our bruises and study
with the dream to somehow make it.

336
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,670
But you chase our girls away
by harassing them?

337
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,540
You will not harass girls again.

338
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,770
Let him go, Karnan.

339
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,240
-You will not harass girls again.
-Stop, or you'll kill him.

340
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:54,580
That's enough.
-Let go of me, man.

341
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:56,640
Stop. Let go.

342
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,950
Come.

343
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,350
Come on.

344
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:12,330
Yeman!

345
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,160
You're just yapping there casually
after everything you've done!

346
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,060
Come here.

347
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,500
Why just him?
Summon his whole gang.

348
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,070
What are you gawking at?
Come here.

349
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,940
-How cocky!
-You're right.

350
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:25,410
He never abides.
We must banish him from the village.

351
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,810
Move, man.

352
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,880
Don't run your mouth.
Stay calm.

353
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,420
Karnan, barely a week since you were
entrusted with the sword...

354
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,180
you've already brought hell upon us.

355
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,190
-How can we trust you?
-What did I do?

356
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:40,520
-Huh?
-Boy...

357
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,820
You may spin your tales.

358
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:44,160
But everyone here knows
who's the troublemaker.

359
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:47,460
The eagles will surely come
swooping down on you.

360
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,430
Don't come begging the village
for protection then.

361
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,600
So concerned, aren't you?

362
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,330
The eagles will only
swoop down on us.

363
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,570
We won't come begging
for protection. Happy?

364
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,040
-Shut up.
-Hey!

365
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,370
Are you trying to cause a rift
between the two villages?

366
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,640
We have so much green here,
and all this water.

367
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,410
But do any of us have
land to our name?

368
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,580
-We are at their mercy for everything.
-Yes.

369
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,780
We'll remain at their mercy
if we stay holed up here.

370
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:10,520
That's why they ensure that
we never get to leave our village.

371
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,820
If we had a bus stop and rode on buses,
they know we'd go places.

372
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,860
Is that your argument?

373
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,330
You do know what they'll do
if we talk this way?

374
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,990
-Not this old wives' tale again.
-Old wives' tale?

375
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,860
Can anyone board a bus there
by oneself now?

376
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,830
Don't say that to me.

377
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,940
Say it to the girl's father
whose head hangs in shame.

378
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,310
You don't have the spine
to send an eager girl to college.

379
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,110
But you've called a meeting
to deliver justice.

380
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,410
-Mind your words.
-What did you just say?

381
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,210
You're going to let that young lad
get away with such disrespect?

382
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,580
You're so soft on him.

383
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,850
They harassed a student.

384
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,450
Was he supposed
to stand by and watch?

385
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,150
Just sit down, man.

386
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,860
-Shut up!
-That punk disgraced our village.

387
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,490
And I should keep quiet?

388
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,660
So what if he wielded the sword?
Is he such a big guy now?

389
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,230
He didn't disgrace us.

390
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,830
For the first time in eight years,
he wielded the village sword.

391
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,830
You say he disgraced us?
He demanded justice for our daughter.

392
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,500
-Her father's head hangs in shame.
-Please sit down.

393
00:30:01,570 --> 00:30:03,000
Will this village
deliver justice to him?

394
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,970
Those who harassed her
are the real culprits.

395
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:08,410
Girls who wish to study or work
are now afraid to step out.

396
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,540
What's the solution?

397
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,710
Why should we be afraid?

398
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,110
Like hell we'll be afraid.

399
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,850
First, find a way
to make the bus stop here.

400
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,620
Everything else is pointless.

401
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,820
We're not afraid of anybody.

402
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,250
Come on. How much longer should we
run around for a bus?

403
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,390
It's about time we ran around
for our children.

404
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:26,290
Let them not stay shut up
in the village like we did.

405
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
Let them fly away somewhere.

406
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,070
Then call the meeting to a close.

407
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,770
The meeting is done.
Leave!

408
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,850
He never disciplines them.

409
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:52,420
The village will be ruined if he
keeps coddling these troublemakers.

410
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,290
What would you have me do?

411
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,190
What do you mean?
We must do something!

412
00:30:58,290 --> 00:30:59,330
My foot!

413
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,660
You heckled that girl,
what did you expect?

414
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,100
Of course, they hit you.

415
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:08,270
They're at our mercy, stooped before us
with folded hands, even for a bus stop.

416
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,370
You should savour it.

417
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,640
You should feel happy.

418
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,540
Instead, you went and picked a quarrel!

419
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:17,210
Now they have stood up to us.
Who will you show your might to?

420
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,310
-Look at the size of him.
-So...

421
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,150
you're just letting him go?

422
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,920
Who said we're letting him go?

423
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,990
If you kill him now,
their village will rise against us.

424
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:29,190
Even our puppets in their village
will fight back.

425
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,460
Is that what we want?

426
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,730
They dared to parade around
with an elephant.

427
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,190
Let's put an end to that first.

428
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,330
Then we'll swoop down on them.

429
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Here, Brother.

430
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,870
Why have they bound
the donkey's legs together?

431
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:50,140
Why do you think?
To keep it from running away.

432
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,910
What a horrible way
to bind it. Fools.

433
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,010
Shall I free it?

434
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,350
It can't be freed by us.

435
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,950
Only the donkey's master can.
He's made an intricate knot.

436
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,550
Want to see me do it?

437
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:02,120
Be quiet, Lad.

438
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:05,190
The master will have
to go looking for it. Such a nag!

439
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,730
Hey, Poyilal...

440
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,570
Heard you told your father
you'll never go to college?

441
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,100
Have you gone crazy?

442
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,240
I know why you're afraid.

443
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:18,870
I will come and
enrol you in the hostel.

444
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:19,940
Let it go, Brother.

445
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:22,310
My mother was so shaken up yesterday.

446
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,080
She didn't sleep all night...

447
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,780
and held my hand,
begging me not to study.

448
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,120
But you were so excited
about going to college.

449
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,350
It's alright, Brother.
It's just one year.

450
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:32,450
Maybe next year.

451
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,620
No, Poyilal. A year of your life
will go to waste!

452
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,460
Whose life isn't getting
wasted out here?

453
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:39,390
Forget it, Brother.
You got into trouble because of me.

454
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,300
I'm off now.
Let's go.

455
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,540
We're watching a girl give up education,
and can't do squat.

456
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,210
This is no way to live.

457
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,440
Let it go.

458
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:54,210
She got scared.

459
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,740
We'll let this year go.

460
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:58,210
Next year we shall enrol her
in a hostel or something.

461
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,810
Forget about that.

462
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,020
That girl... Draupadi.

463
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,460
She looks at you like
she could eat you up.

464
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,290
What's the matter?

465
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,730
Man, are you crazy?

466
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,160
She's doing no such thing.

467
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,230
-Hey, don't act naive.
-What?

468
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,570
Are you both secretly getting it on?

469
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:22,670
She's ravaging you with her eyes.

470
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,440
Like she has nothing better to do.

471
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,210
Could someone have the hots for me?

472
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,780
I know what I saw.

473
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,810
She had the hots.
Alright?

474
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,780
Let's end this conversation now.

475
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:35,580
-Don't want the butterball to hear us.
-Why are you rummaging?

476
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,420
Checking to see if you have any money.

477
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,320
For what?

478
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,790
They are gambling
by the furnace.

479
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:41,490
Come, let's give it a shot.

480
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,390
Oh, for that?
You go ahead.

481
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,560
-I'll get the money.
-How?

482
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,930
-What do you care?
-Hurry up.

483
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:51,060
When I want money,
I can make it appear.

484
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,210
So, sister-in-law...

485
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,650
Is that you, Husband of Manjanathi?

486
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,810
Yes, sister-in-law.
It's me, Yeman.

487
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:11,290
Oh, it is you.
Come and sit, let's have a chat.

488
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,590
Sit next to me.

489
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,220
I was just passing by
and I noticed you sitting here.

490
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,390
I thought I'd check on you.

491
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,030
You still look the same, Lady!

492
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,900
Before your Manjanathi died,
she did tell me.

493
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,500
-"I'm leaving my young husband."
-There she goes again.

494
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,900
"If he approaches you out of longing,
take good care of him"

495
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,370
"and don't get angry, dear sister,"
she told me before dying.

496
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,910
It's been thirty years since she passed.

497
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:34,980
You didn't come to me
all those years...

498
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,080
but you have come to me now.
What do I have to offer?

499
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:40,350
Nothing.
Everything is gone.

500
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,320
You should have come
when I was young.

501
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,520
I'll see you, then.

502
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,520
Husband of Manjanathi...

503
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,890
Will ten rupees do?

504
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,530
You noticed?

505
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,070
You needn't touch my body.
I'll know when a man touches my saree.

506
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:04,740
And you ask me if I noticed,
Husband of Manjanathi?

507
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,540
-Take this.
-No, keep the money.

508
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,810
Just give me a kiss worth ten rupees
and be on your way.

509
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,290
Will that do, m'lady?

510
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,040
Here's my bet!

511
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,000
Do you even know
how to flip two coins at once?

512
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,040
Why are you just watching, Karnan?
Aren't you playing?

513
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,580
-I'm in.
-What do you mean?

514
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:47,980
-Lay down your money then.
-It's coming. Flip it.

515
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,480
Out of my way!

516
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:50,950
What happened?

517
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:52,690
How's that?

518
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,190
Lay it on top.

519
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,690
I need a win!

520
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,290
Move... move!

521
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,230
Give me the coin.

522
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,860
The buy-in is 10 bucks.

523
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,600
Karnan, the first toss
had better be on-point.

524
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,730
Flip it!

525
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,870
Well done!

526
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:12,270
Toss it high.

527
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,610
Yes!

528
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:15,980
Grab it all!

529
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,950
-Give me my money.
-It might rain.

530
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,680
-Collect it faster.
-Give me some money.

531
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,290
Don't put that money in there!

532
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,350
That's dirty money.

533
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,290
-He won that money gambling.
-So what?

534
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,460
He plays for fun.
Don't create such a fuss!

535
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,490
"For fun?"

536
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,730
Did he hit the Melur men for fun?

537
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:36,900
Did he disobey me
and cut the fish for fun?

538
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:40,030
-"For fun," she says.
-Shut your mouth, Mom!

539
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,770
What? You shut me up
all the time.

540
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,870
Do you want to remain
a spinster forever?

541
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,270
-If I do, I do.
-I'm sure you don't mind.

542
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:50,310
Your mother's womb burns in agony
upon hearing everyone's mockery.

543
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:53,080
-She doesn't mind...
-It's not his fault.

544
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,920
It's not like he's idling.

545
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,980
He attends every selection.

546
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,190
Something good will come his way.

547
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Just a matter of time.

548
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,490
Until then, you shut your mouth.

549
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,990
You birthed us in a village where
buses don't even stop.

550
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:05,990
Look!

551
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,500
He's done enough gallivanting
in the name of selection.

552
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Tell him to come
work the furnace tomorrow.

553
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,570
He's got that big sword.

554
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,670
Tell him to bring it along
to chop firewood.

555
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,740
-She talks like I'm a madwoman.
-Mom!

556
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:19,140
Did he win that sword
to chop firewood?

557
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,440
You've got some nerve,
you cocky woman.

558
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:26,350
He's not asleep.
He's listening to everything.

559
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,920
You are so dead.

560
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,080
Where's he off to now?

561
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,920
What are you doing?

562
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:35,620
Stop. Where are you taking it?

563
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:38,490
Your mother said I am a free-loader.
I will chop firewood.

564
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,660
How will you chop firewood with this?
Give it to me.

565
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,560
-You can chop onions.
-Onions?

566
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,930
You people take me for a joke.

567
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,600
I will handle the furnace today.

568
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,170
I don't need anybody's help.

569
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:51,100
Look at him.

570
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:54,140
He just sits here digging.
Nobody questions him.

571
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,950
-What are you staring at?
-Nothing.

572
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,190
I know a snuffling dog
when I see one.

573
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,490
I ran into the postman.

574
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:12,830
There's an open selection in Tirunelveli.
He asked you to go. Here.

575
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,660
Take it!

576
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,900
Always over-thinking...

577
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,330
I have a feeling you will
get through this time.

578
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,770
Don't come back and say,
"The bus didn't stop."

579
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:24,770
But I won't go to their bus stop.

580
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,940
Who told you to go there?

581
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:30,140
Go to our junction early and
hitch a ride with a van or lorry.

582
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,830
Go!

583
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,500
Keep running...

584
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,770
Keep running...

585
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,640
Third round, come on.

586
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,890
Get up...

587
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,200
Get up...

588
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,000
Get up...

589
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,510
Here comes our Kattabomman Bus!

590
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,580
-Come...
-What?

591
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,520
Stop!

592
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,750
Stop here, at least.

593
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,290
Where to, Grandpa?
Are you buying tickets to Melur?

594
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,220
No way. Let's buy tickets to Kurichi
and walk past the pond.

595
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,660
-Get in!
-Okay, Grandpa.

596
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,730
Move to the front.
Not the back!

597
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,060
Move to the front...

598
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Go on.

599
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,900
Ticket, ticket, ticket!

600
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,900
Give me the change, please.

601
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,240
I have no change.

602
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,710
Ticket..

603
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:42,910
Grandpa...

604
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,080
Look who's there.

605
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,310
Who is it?

606
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,520
Oh, it's your girl!

607
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,020
Has she seen you?

608
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,190
I think she did.

609
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,290
Her hands are trembling.

610
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,290
See, I was right.

611
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,660
I can feel the heat
from all the way here.

612
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,230
Maybe she came down to Tirunelveli
after hearing you were here?

613
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,570
Listen...

614
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,900
walk up to her and ask
if she's bought a ticket.

615
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,670
If not, we'll buy it for her.

616
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,170
Wow, boy!

617
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,710
Excuse me, please.

618
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,580
-Dear...
-Yes, Grandpa?

619
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,080
-Have you bought a ticket?
-Yes!

620
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,850
Oh, you have?
Where to?

621
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,520
-Melur.
-Oh.

622
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,250
Okay.

623
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,520
Please move...

624
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,120
She's bought a ticket to Melur.

625
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,120
Melur?

626
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,730
Why would she buy
a ticket to Melur?

627
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,390
How would I know?
Our girls always get down there.

628
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:36,900
Today, she will get down
at our village.

629
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,570
Our village?

630
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,200
We'll either get off at Kurichi,
or at our village.

631
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,270
How's that possible?
What's wrong with you?

632
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,270
Ticket! Who wants a ticket?

633
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,140
-Eleven tickets to Podiyankulam.
-What? Podiyankulam?

634
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,980
We won't make a stop there.

635
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,410
I'll stop at the neighbouring Melur.

636
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,310
Get off there.

637
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:54,920
You won't make a stop
even for 11 tickets?

638
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,080
-Speak calmly...
-Speak calmly?

639
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,350
-We can't stop there.
-Today, you will.

640
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:02,620
There's no rule forcing us
to make a stop there.

641
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,160
Nobody can do a thing.

642
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,190
You keep harping on about
stopping the bus!

643
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,300
Does your village even have a bus stop?

644
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,400
To you people, it's a village.

645
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:12,030
To us, it's just a wasteland.

646
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,830
Who would make a stop
at a wasteland?

647
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,940
-Did you just call it a wasteland?
-Don't mess with me!

648
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,940
-Let go of me.
-Say that again, I'll smack your jaw.

649
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,380
-I am calling it what it is.
-Hey!

650
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,480
Call it a wasteland, did you?
You better make a stop there.

651
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,110
Or I'll show you
where Podiyankulam is.

652
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,580
-He won't stop for 11 tickets?
-You just attended the selection.

653
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,320
-Don't start now.
-I should shut up?

654
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,320
Chandralingam, what's the matter?

655
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,190
He wants us to make a stop
at Podiyankulam.

656
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:35,660
Podiyankulam? Where's that?

657
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:36,960
Who knows?

658
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,830
-Hey!
-You're crossing a line!

659
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,490
There is no way I'll let you
get down there.

660
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,330
Get out of my way!

661
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,670
They come just to cause trouble.
We've told them so many times.

662
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,940
-It's okay...
-He called it a wasteland.

663
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,940
I'll make him stop there.

664
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,270
How will you make him stop?

665
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
You'll see.

666
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,080
Why can't they get down
at Melur as always?

667
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,640
This isn't new.

668
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,310
For so many days,
in so many ways...

669
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,150
they've derived pleasure
in our humiliation and misery.

670
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,120
They act like the bus
is their personal property.

671
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,290
Podiyankulam!
Stop!

672
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:07,620
Podiyankulam! Stop!
Podiyankulam! Podiyankulam!

673
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:09,820
Podiyankulam! Podiyankulam!
Stop!

674
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,160
Podiyankulam!
Stop!

675
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,330
-Podiyankulam! Stop!
-Karnan...

676
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:15,500
Podiyankulam! Stop!

677
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:16,500
Podiyankulam!
Podiyankulam!

678
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,500
-Podiyankulam! Stop!
-Karnan, step inside.

679
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,770
-Karnan, listen to me...
-Podiyankulam! Let me go!

680
00:43:21,870 --> 00:43:23,270
Karnan!

681
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,610
Oh, no!

682
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,710
Stop the bus!

683
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,580
Stop the bus!

684
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:31,910
Stop the bus.

685
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,350
Hurry...

686
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,650
Come on.

687
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,250
-What happened?
-Karnan...

688
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:39,350
Karnan, are you okay?

689
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,690
Get off me!

690
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,460
Look, they're moving the bus.

691
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,620
Get him!

692
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:45,530
Start the bus.

693
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,730
Stop them.

694
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:50,400
You'll have to take this route
again tomorrow. I'll sort you out.

695
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,100
-Show me.
-Go away!

696
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,430
Are you crazy?
You're acting like a fool.

697
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,740
You could have died!

698
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,370
I'm so pissed, just shut your mouth
and get out of here.

699
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,480
Boy, what did I just tell you?
"Lay low for a few days."

700
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,780
"A good opportunity
has come your way."

701
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,580
"You shouldn't let this go
at any cost."

702
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:07,480
Did you not hear that?

703
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:09,850
Did I not hear what?

704
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,190
Some guy just called
our village a wasteland.

705
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:13,450
Didn't that prick you?

706
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,120
It did prick me.
That was his intention.

707
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,820
Does that mean you pounce on him?

708
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:21,230
What if he'd driven
the bus to the police station?

709
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:22,700
Did you think about that?
Did you?

710
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,770
Well, if he does,
let something come of it.

711
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:28,500
You can't do as you please,
and get triggered all the time.

712
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:31,640
Or nobody from our village
will stand by you.

713
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,740
I hope you know that?

714
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:34,440
You'd do well to remember that...

715
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,640
and keep shut.

716
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,250
Good Lord! I am keeping shut.
Happy? Go!

717
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,650
Karnan...

718
00:44:40,810 --> 00:44:41,920
I'll whack you.

719
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,520
Stop lecturing me.

720
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,190
Fine, get up.
Let's go.

721
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,230
-Come on, let's go.
-Get lost!

722
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:14,610
In a carriage of dragonflies
I hover like a chicken feather

723
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:22,750
In a raging bonfire
She hits me like a hurricane

724
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:29,620
Like I were a bud in a boulder
I burst into a bloom

725
00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:35,660
Like she was highland honey
I guzzled her down

726
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,840
The seer who read my palm
Said a story that you proved true

727
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:45,140
In this path that I walk down

728
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,110
Your piercing gaze uproots unseen thorn

729
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:53,810
In a carriage of dragonflies

730
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:58,520
I hover like a chicken feather

731
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:05,030
In a raging bonfire
She hits me like a hurricane

732
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:58,910
Like fresh grain in an earthen pot
Your fragrance fills my heart

733
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:03,750
The warmth of your sultry gaze
It could even steam rice

734
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:10,360
Even though I tread on dirt-roads
Even though I'm covered in grime

735
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:14,730
The 'dhavani' draped over your shoulder
Makes a king out of me, girl

736
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:20,770
In my red-hot inferno heart
Your memories are a calming drizzle

737
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:26,040
I lurk in this village as a mere shadow
You are my true object, love

738
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:32,150
Give me a kiss, my princess
And I'll give you all of me

739
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,290
In a carriage of dragonflies
I hover like a chicken feather

740
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:46,730
In a raging bonfire
She hits me like a hurricane

741
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:01,640
The farmer descends into paddy-fields
Deftly, he picks the seedlings

742
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:07,080
Protecting land like it were gold
This great clan, this farmer's clan

743
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,620
Our ancestors lost the uplands
Our forefathers lost the farmlands

744
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,620
Our God lies there still as stone

745
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:20,030
We became "wasteland"
We became bonded labour

746
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:24,830
You must triumph, child
You must triumph!

747
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:31,210
Crows and sparrows
They huddle up every day

748
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:37,440
And tell our tale to the clouds
As they listen cravingly, pelting rain

749
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:45,790
Set fire with our bodies
Get drenched in our burning souls

750
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,190
A carriage of dragonflies

751
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,990
A carriage of dragonflies

752
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:57,230
In a carriage of dragonflies
I hover like a chicken feather

753
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:05,810
In a raging bonfire
She hits me like a hurricane

754
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,610
Like a hurricane

755
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:14,150
Like a hurricane

756
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,690
A carriage of dragonflies

757
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:21,860
A carriage of dragonflies

758
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:24,360
A carriage of dragonflies

759
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:14,640
Dad...

760
00:51:15,810 --> 00:51:18,650
You came all the way to see me.
Why are you crying?

761
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,980
Your sister still lives
in our house, dear.

762
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,850
Your father hasn't been able to
get her married.

763
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,750
But I left money behind at home.

764
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,360
What? It's the truth, Dad
Go and search for it.

765
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,730
Go!

766
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,400
Get up.

767
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,070
Oh, be careful!

768
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,440
Why have you come at this hour?

769
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:48,110
-Dig, dig, dig...
-What do you want, Goddess?

770
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,480
Hurry up and fetch your brother.

771
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,150
-Oh, Goddess!
-Treasure...

772
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,080
Dig! Dig!

773
00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:00,450
Do you want water, Goddess?

774
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:02,390
Karnan, wake up.

775
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:04,790
-Karnan, wake up! Come inside.
-What is it?

776
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,990
Come.

777
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:09,830
Dig!

778
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,400
What now?

779
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,030
What's with him?

780
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:15,100
Son, your sister has come.

781
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,440
There's treasure underneath.
She's asked us to dig.

782
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:20,440
Dig!

783
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:23,240
Treasure?

784
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,810
He's dancing around like a madman
and you're dancing along?

785
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,950
If someone saw this night circus,
they'd laugh at our family's insanity.

786
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:32,790
Don't speak that way, son.

787
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,120
My daughter is visiting after so long.
Don't hurt her feelings.

788
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,720
You're still on about that?

789
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,160
Pour a bucket of water over him,
he'll be fine.

790
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,530
Stop talking back!

791
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,160
Just do as she says.

792
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:45,570
You're with her?

793
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,530
Will you dig or not?

794
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,210
Fine. And if there's nothing,
what shall we do with you lot?

795
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:54,580
Speak another word and I will
strangle you to death.

796
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,640
Curse my fate!

797
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,040
Come, take a peek.

798
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:30,540
Do you see any treasure in there?

799
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,680
If you tell me to dig any deeper,
I'll smash your head!

800
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:34,150
Just dig a little deeper, son.

801
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,920
What did I just say?
You keep telling me to dig...

802
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,620
Just dig.

803
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:40,690
There's nothing here to dig!

804
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,020
Here, take all this treasure.
Take it.

805
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,700
My daughter kept her word.

806
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:59,440
She saved all this money...

807
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,710
I lost such a sweet child...

808
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:09,580
I let her die in the middle of a road...

809
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,790
Where is my little one wandering now?

810
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:16,720
Why did nobody stop the bus?

811
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,230
My child could have been saved...

812
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:22,760
I lost her.
I let her die.

813
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:24,570
She died...

814
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:27,230
She said she had saved it
for her sister's wedding.

815
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:29,600
My baby!

816
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,540
I lost my little flower.

817
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:39,480
I wonder where she's wandering
all by herself...

818
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,150
No!

819
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:47,720
No!

820
00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:58,330
My precious.

821
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:15,320
Hey, Veeman...

822
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,450
Let's take Vadamalayan
to the cleaners today.

823
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,420
He always returns
to lose more money.

824
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,290
Karnan, go for it.
I'm betting on two heads.

825
00:55:25,290 --> 00:55:26,130
Two heads.

826
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:29,000
Uncle, did you sight a trickster
in the morning?

827
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,760
Your boy is killing it.
Here's a fifty.

828
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:33,230
Started grumbling already?
Flip it.

829
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:36,340
Two heads again.

830
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:38,040
-It's done!
-So, Karnan?

831
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,280
You'll get your sister married off
today with this money?

832
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,810
You really are something!

833
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:46,010
You think 150 rupees
will cover the cost of a wedding?

834
00:55:46,310 --> 00:55:48,150
-Stop taunting, just play.
-Uncle!

835
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,520
I am not joking.

836
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,020
Let him say the word and
I'll take his sister as my second wife.

837
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,190
You--!

838
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,960
What did you say?
What did you say?

839
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,360
Karnan, let him go.

840
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,860
Let go of me.
Let go.

841
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,400
-I'll get you! Let me go.
-Come on...

842
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,660
No, listen to me...

843
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:04,670
That punk kicked me on my chest.

844
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:07,070
-I will make you pay for this.
-Just get out of here.

845
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,270
-If I let him go, he'll rip your--
-Let go of me!

846
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:10,340
Karnan!

847
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,310
No, no.
Stop!

848
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,940
-What did you say? Say that again.
-Let him go.

849
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,780
-He didn't mean it.
-Let me go!

850
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,310
You believe he was joking?
Look at his eyes!

851
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:21,150
Cunning fox!
He's trying to make a move.

852
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:22,350
Come face me now!

853
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,180
I'll rip your throat out
and swallow it, son of a gun!

854
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,120
Let go!

855
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:26,520
Why are you holding me back?

856
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,120
Karnan, why take him seriously
and retaliate?

857
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,230
Just tell his wife
and she will kick him.

858
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,390
Get lost!

859
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:48,080
-Perumal...
-Yes, brother?

860
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:51,910
Go to Sister Maharasi's house
and bring Draupadi down here.

861
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,280
What should I say it's about?

862
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:54,850
Just make up something.

863
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,120
Tell her that your horse
is not eating hay.

864
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:59,690
She's the one who fed him hay,
how could I tell her that?

865
00:56:59,790 --> 00:57:01,890
Do as you are told, boy.

866
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:03,720
-Go on, boy.
-He thinks I'm jobless.

867
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,360
Hurry up, boy.

868
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,060
There's no need to lie.

869
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,030
She'd come running
if he said that you called.

870
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,500
Don't know what the butterball
told her about me.

871
00:57:11,830 --> 00:57:13,270
Let her come, we'll see.

872
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,870
This is between you and her.
Do what you want.

873
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:17,540
I'm off.

874
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,710
Why, it's eating just fine.

875
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:24,080
What did you call me for?

876
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,810
Where the hell has he gone?

877
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:29,320
It didn't eat then, sister.
It's eating now.

878
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:30,350
What?

879
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,620
Stupid boy.

880
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,220
-Let me go.
-Wait!

881
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:39,060
-Girl... wait!
-Let go.

882
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,960
Don't walk away when I've come
to meet you.

883
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:41,860
I didn't call you.

884
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:43,860
Don't act too smart.

885
00:57:43,930 --> 00:57:46,200
-Stop running your mouth.
-Let go of my hand.

886
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,430
Let go!

887
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,770
Don't go on repeating the same thing
like a madwoman.

888
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,440
Yes, I am a madwoman.

889
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:56,110
You chase me around to kiss me,
and you chase my brother to kick him.

890
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,080
And I'm still here talking to you.
I sure am mad.

891
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:59,180
-Hey...
-Let go!

892
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,450
Just doing what's appropriate
with each person.

893
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,180
What? I am saying it like it is.

894
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,150
Let go of my hand.

895
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:07,220
You don't know what went on,
don't hit the roof.

896
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,790
-I know what happened.
-What do you know? Huh?

897
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:12,560
Grandpa! Grandpa!
They're fighting.

898
00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:15,400
You hit him over gambling money.

899
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:18,030
You are so arrogant.
Let me go!

900
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,000
Hey!

901
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:21,200
Just stay put and hear me out.

902
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:22,200
Let me go.

903
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,570
-Or what?
-I'll scream.

904
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:25,270
Go ahead and scream.
Get back!

905
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:26,870
-We'll talk it out. Go!
-I will scream.

906
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:28,610
-Go on, scream.
-I swear, I will.

907
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:31,810
He's acting crazy,
you should be sensible.

908
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,910
Why are you yelling at me?
He's the one holding me.

909
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,980
Tell him.

910
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,680
-Let her go...
-Fine, I'm letting go.

911
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,020
Get lost.

912
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:40,020
-Glaring at me? I'll smack your face.
-Come with me...

913
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,020
Why are you always
getting into trouble?

914
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:45,830
I shouldn't hang out with young people.
You've humiliated me again.

915
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:48,130
She has no idea what her brother said,
she's just shouting.

916
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,600
And you're taking her side.

917
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,370
Okay, sir. Carry on.

918
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,770
My girl Manjanathi
Like hibiscus flower, she's so pretty

919
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,940
Pecking me with her eyes
She made me swoon, that enchantress

920
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:36,210
My girl Manjanathi
Like hibiscus flower, she's so pretty

921
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:39,910
Pecking me with her two eyes
She made me swoon, that seductress

922
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,820
Tucked under my armpit

923
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:46,490
The towel tucked under my armpit -
She draped it on my shoulder

924
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:50,390
I was such a sober guy
She got my passion raging high

925
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,390
Tucked under my armpit

926
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:56,730
The towel tucked under my armpit -
She draped it on my shoulder

927
00:59:57,030 --> 01:00:00,600
I was such a sober guy
She got my passion raging high

928
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,440
That pretty little bird

929
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,810
That pretty little bird

930
01:00:04,910 --> 01:00:07,240
That pretty little bird
That precious princess

931
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:11,750
Hear her story
O Buzzing Bee

932
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,780
My girl Manjanathi
Like hibiscus flower, she's so pretty

933
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,750
Pecking me with her two eyes
She made me swoon, that seductress

934
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,820
My girl Manjanathi...

935
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,190
Once a week we met each other
By the hillsides of Vallanadu

936
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:55,560
Wading through a labyrinth of thickets
Winded and panting, we extracted honey

937
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:59,660
Near the village of Kakkulam
In the shrine of deity Kaala Saami

938
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:03,660
We offered our castes in sacrifice
And wedded with sandal and vermilion

939
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,530
My Manjanathi...

940
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,770
My Manjanathi lit the prayer lamp
In Yeman's household

941
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:13,640
She took a no-good bull like me
And mounted me on an elephant

942
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:15,740
That pretty bud

943
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:18,050
That pretty bud

944
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,450
The pretty bud, that pretty doll

945
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,320
Hear her story
O Buzzing Bee

946
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,850
O Buzzing Bee
O Buzzing Bee

947
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:52,480
With fine clay from Karuppandora
We built ourselves a concrete house

948
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,420
We brought home four puppies
And raised them as our babies

949
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,550
The wretched people of our castes
Would come after us with swords

950
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:04,220
Ready to match them in a fight
Sword in hand, I waited on my porch

951
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,290
My Manjanathi...

952
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:13,930
My Manjanathi...

953
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:20,570
What evil possessed
My Manjanathi's body?

954
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:25,350
Cholera was the name of the disease

955
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:29,180
Devoured her before Yeman's eyes

956
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:33,720
The pretty bud, that pretty doll
Hear her story, O Buzzing Bee

957
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,120
O Buzzing Bee!

958
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:39,160
Yeman!

959
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:40,830
Don't cry, don't cry!

960
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:41,960
Hit it!

961
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:11,860
Hey...

962
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,290
Grandpa, come here.

963
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:39,690
I need to speak to you.

964
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,960
What brings you here?

965
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,320
What happened to him?

966
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,390
What happened to him?
Nothing happened.

967
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,160
Oh...

968
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,100
yesterday, he had a little bit to drink.
Just the one time.

969
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:54,170
I swear on my Manjanathi,
I will not let him drink again.

970
01:03:54,270 --> 01:03:56,040
-Okay? Go on now...
-Wait.

971
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:57,370
I'm not talking about that.

972
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,870
Something's happened to him.

973
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:00,210
You're hiding something.

974
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,410
He never meets my gaze.

975
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:05,680
-Tell me what happened to him.
-What do you want me to say?

976
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,580
Look, Grandpa...

977
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,950
if you care about us,

978
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,790
don't cover up the truth.

979
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:14,120
Nothing could have happened
without your knowledge.

980
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:15,820
That's...

981
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,520
what do I tell her?

982
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,190
Stop murmuring. Tell me!

983
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,230
No... it's nothing.

984
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,730
The boy was hanging around with
Vadamalayan's sister Draupadi,

985
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:28,600
I guess she spoke to him in a
confrontational manner yesterday.

986
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,570
I think that triggered him
to behave that way.

987
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:33,610
There's nothing else.
Dear...

988
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,110
Do you dare to drink?
Dare to drink?

989
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:43,180
-Shut up or I'll kill you too.
-What's wrong?

990
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,120
You were acting all this time,
and fooling the family.

991
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,520
Shut up and leave.

992
01:04:48,620 --> 01:04:50,460
You're a big man now?
A big man, eh?

993
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,490
You want a partner, do you?

994
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,860
-What has he done?
-You're asking me?

995
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,200
I let my little brother sit on my head.

996
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:59,930
So he's loafing around town
bringing us disgrace!

997
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,970
Look... look here.

998
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:08,640
All these years, I've run and hid
from so many men.

999
01:05:08,810 --> 01:05:10,640
I've bowed my head
before so many men.

1000
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,310
Think I'm still here at 30 because
I don't know how to elope with a man?

1001
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:15,520
Please stop.

1002
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:17,450
He dares to drink!

1003
01:05:17,850 --> 01:05:23,220
If I leave this house, your family will
have to beg for food, mind you.

1004
01:05:24,890 --> 01:05:26,890
Drinking over some girl...

1005
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,100
Boy...

1006
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,060
take this from me.

1007
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,870
I'd rather rot and turn to dust
right here in this house...

1008
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,140
than leave this house until you
earn money to feed me.

1009
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:40,040
-Oh, it was I who birthed you...
-Just shut up.

1010
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:41,540
Drop the act.

1011
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:45,750
Mother and son have done nothing but act,
and run this family to the ground.

1012
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:51,080
She hit my poor boy.

1013
01:05:52,020 --> 01:05:53,720
Don't feel bad, precious.

1014
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:56,520
Mom will bring you a fresh plate.

1015
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:27,690
Hey, Karnan...

1016
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,060
Go away.

1017
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,890
Don't recognise me?

1018
01:06:32,130 --> 01:06:33,230
What do you want?

1019
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:35,300
Come, let's go to Kurichi.

1020
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,060
For what?

1021
01:06:37,230 --> 01:06:39,370
To play kabbadi.
The boys are waiting.

1022
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:40,870
-Come.
-Why are you calling me?

1023
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:43,240
I stir up trouble wherever
I go, don't I?

1024
01:06:43,970 --> 01:06:46,710
-Oh, just come.
-Why do you annoy me to death?

1025
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:49,240
If you want to go somewhere, go.
Why are you calling me?

1026
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:50,440
Let me be.

1027
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:51,380
Go away!

1028
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,650
-Okay, I'm going.
-Fine.

1029
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,350
-Come by my house again and I'll kill you.
-Fine, I won't come.

1030
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,620
Hey, you...

1031
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,560
-Artist, listen.
-What, Grandpa?

1032
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,720
Let me finish!

1033
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,990
-You can complete it tomorrow.
-Yeman, he's not done.

1034
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:07,660
He'll come and paint tomorrow.

1035
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:08,660
Come on.

1036
01:07:08,730 --> 01:07:10,930
Artist, don't forget to
finish it tomorrow.

1037
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:14,670
Brother...

1038
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:17,240
Sister Draupadi asked you to
come to the temple.

1039
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:18,970
Draupadi called me?

1040
01:07:19,070 --> 01:07:20,870
Tell her I'll kill her if I come.
Go away!

1041
01:07:21,070 --> 01:07:21,940
Brother...

1042
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,880
-She's waiting.
-Get lost, boy.

1043
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,850
Come quietly.

1044
01:07:57,210 --> 01:07:58,450
Spectators, stand back.

1045
01:07:58,550 --> 01:08:00,010
Linesman, watch the line.
Not the game.

1046
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:02,120
Great play!
Two points.

1047
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,350
Podiyankulam, two points.

1048
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,630
Keep an eye on the line.

1049
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:16,030
Don't be watching the game.
Line up those who are out.

1050
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,530
Beautiful play!

1051
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,100
Beauty!

1052
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:28,080
Well played!

1053
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:30,210
Obey the referee.

1054
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,250
Please co-operate.

1055
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:34,780
Men standing next to women,
maintain some distance.

1056
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:36,280
Seat them separately.

1057
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:39,150
Don't allow girls to be seated
near boys.

1058
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,650
Girls should know better.

1059
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,290
Beauty! Another point.

1060
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,460
Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddi...

1061
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,560
Nobody enters the tent area.

1062
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,400
Tent area for committee members only.

1063
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:55,440
Karnan...

1064
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:59,270
If you refuse to step in now, we'd have
fought well till the end and then lost.

1065
01:08:59,410 --> 01:09:00,310
Step in.

1066
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,140
Can you not hear me?

1067
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,140
Karnan...

1068
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,750
Hey, I'm talking to you!

1069
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:08,120
If you don't step in now...

1070
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,920
I won't speak to you
till I die.

1071
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,650
I swear this upon my wife Manjanathi.

1072
01:09:16,620 --> 01:09:19,990
In a few minutes,
we'll know who the winner is.

1073
01:09:20,130 --> 01:09:23,160
It's a do or die situation
for Podiyankulam.

1074
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:27,700
Another five minutes before
we know the winner of the game.

1075
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:31,440
The exciting last few minutes
of the game...

1076
01:09:31,940 --> 01:09:33,610
He caught him!

1077
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:35,240
Time out.

1078
01:09:35,310 --> 01:09:36,980
One point to Podiyankulam.

1079
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,180
What an exciting game...

1080
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:44,280
Kabaddi kabaddi...

1081
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:45,690
-End it now.
-Right, boss.

1082
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,190
Kabaddi kabaddi kabaddi...

1083
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:51,490
Get close...

1084
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:53,160
-Kabaddi...
-Don't be fooled by him.

1085
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,700
An enjoyable game for the fans.
And he scores!

1086
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:59,200
Two points it is.

1087
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,830
Two points for Podiyankulam.

1088
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:03,500
-Brother, three points. I got him.
-No, only two points.

1089
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,710
-No. Only two points.
-But I kicked him.

1090
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,940
-Don't argue with the referee.
-But I got him!

1091
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:09,410
If they disagree,
they can leave.

1092
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:11,310
-I swear, I touched him.
-No, two points.

1093
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:13,280
-How can it be two points?
-It is two points.

1094
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:14,310
Liar!

1095
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,250
Karnan, don't do this.

1096
01:10:16,820 --> 01:10:17,650
Get out.

1097
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,120
You cheater!

1098
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,390
Get lost.

1099
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:21,790
They are lying, man!

1100
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,690
Or what? What can you do?

1101
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:27,390
I thrashed you people just
the other day. Ask them!

1102
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,400
-I'll rip you apart.
-Oh, go on and try.

1103
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,330
What can you do?
Get lost!

1104
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,870
Do your worst.

1105
01:10:32,930 --> 01:10:34,100
Bloody cheats.

1106
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:14,240
Why couldn't you be a bit patient?

1107
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:17,580
Look, if you keep saying that,
I'll split your head open.

1108
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:20,680
No matter which path we take,
they stand in our way.

1109
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:23,150
They're plotting and clipping our wings.
You want me to say nothing?

1110
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:25,690
So? This is their village.

1111
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:27,650
They came just to mess with us.

1112
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:30,360
Do you know what would've
happened if you went any further?

1113
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:31,730
You could have been killed.

1114
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:34,560
If you're afraid of killings,
why bring us here, coward?

1115
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:38,930
I could've hung their intestines
on a bull's horn that day.

1116
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:41,440
You dragged me away,
and now you have the nerve to talk?

1117
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:42,940
Fine.

1118
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,610
I made a mistake bringing you.
Forgive me.

1119
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:48,980
But shouldn't you speak
a bit patiently?

1120
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:50,310
No, we shouldn't.

1121
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,410
What's it to you?

1122
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,680
You spent your life
dilly-dallying here.

1123
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,250
Our lives have just begun.

1124
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:58,620
Look...

1125
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,350
if someone gets in my way now...

1126
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:02,390
I will hit them.
Move.

1127
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:05,230
Hey!

1128
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:10,730
-What?
-What do you mean?

1129
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:11,730
You gave us your word.

1130
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:15,000
You said he'd come to play,
we could break his limbs while playing.

1131
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:15,900
Yes.

1132
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,410
He insulted you and strutted away,
and you're keeping shut!

1133
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:19,440
So?

1134
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:22,540
You expect me to fight in front
of the village and ruin my reputation?

1135
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,240
There are three kilometers ahead.

1136
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,680
He has to walk back
those three kilometers. Go.

1137
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:28,120
Pick a fight with him.

1138
01:12:28,180 --> 01:12:30,850
-Hack his limbs. I'll handle it.
-You won't go back on your word?

1139
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:32,490
These are my orders.
Go on.

1140
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:33,520
Let's go.

1141
01:12:33,990 --> 01:12:36,190
Don't return to the village until
you've hacked at least one of them.

1142
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:01,450
You don't listen to me anyway.
Do as you please.

1143
01:13:04,450 --> 01:13:06,690
I see a bus coming.
But will they stop?

1144
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:10,190
You idiot! Get lost.

1145
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:15,060
Look how they drive away!
They never stop.

1146
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,660
Jerks!

1147
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:20,830
-Why are you waiting here?
-She refused to wait at Melur Bus Stop.

1148
01:13:21,340 --> 01:13:23,570
Where are you going,
in this condition?

1149
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:25,370
We wanted to go to
the hospital, Grandpa.

1150
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:29,240
We've been waiting forever.
Nobody stopped at this time of need.

1151
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:32,610
-Flag some van and help me out.
-No one ever stops.

1152
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:35,820
Someone must pelt a stone
to teach them a lesson.

1153
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:41,520
Grandpa, look.
There's a bus coming.

1154
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,820
-He won't stop.
-Just give it a shot.

1155
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:45,330
-Let's see if he stops.
-Okay, come.

1156
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:47,230
Maybe they'll stop
for a pregnant lady.

1157
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,000
Stop!

1158
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,100
Stop, man!

1159
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:52,170
Stop!

1160
01:13:52,270 --> 01:13:54,400
The bus is empty and yet
he won't stop.

1161
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,770
Curse him with diarrhoea.

1162
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,570
They broke the glass!

1163
01:13:58,710 --> 01:14:00,070
Stop the bus! Stop!

1164
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,140
They broke the glass.

1165
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,880
Driver, get down.

1166
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:06,780
Who flung that stone?

1167
01:14:06,950 --> 01:14:08,080
Who?

1168
01:14:08,150 --> 01:14:09,150
Who flung the stone?

1169
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:10,280
Was it you?
Come here.

1170
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,950
Come here, people!
Hurry up.

1171
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:14,290
-Don't touch me. Let go!
-You damaged our bus.

1172
01:14:14,350 --> 01:14:15,390
Come on, guys.

1173
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:20,990
Stand back!

1174
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:23,760
Who the hell are you people?

1175
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,100
No! Grandpa...
Be careful.

1176
01:14:27,200 --> 01:14:29,040
They pushed Grandpa down.

1177
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:31,070
You broke the glass.
Drop the act.

1178
01:14:37,410 --> 01:14:39,410
We'll have you all locked up
and thrashed.

1179
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:41,880
NAVMANI
TIRUNELVELI

1180
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:05,940
K. KANNABIRAN, I.P.S
SUPERINTENDENT OF POLICE

1181
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,520
In the end, you proved everyone right.

1182
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:19,790
You've brought ruin
upon every one of us.

1183
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:21,490
Don't say that, Grandpa.

1184
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:23,890
Instead, proudly say that
we went to war.

1185
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:25,490
Shut up. Don't get me started.

1186
01:20:25,630 --> 01:20:26,990
Why should he shut up?

1187
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:29,330
You watched us wreck the bus
and didn't move a finger.

1188
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,600
Yes, I was watching.

1189
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,100
-So what?
-Drop the act.

1190
01:20:33,700 --> 01:20:34,740
And shut your mouth.

1191
01:20:35,070 --> 01:20:37,070
Maybe the village will support us,
maybe they won't.

1192
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:37,970
We'll handle it.

1193
01:20:38,070 --> 01:20:39,470
It's not our village
I'm worried about.

1194
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,240
Then why are you spluttering?

1195
01:20:41,380 --> 01:20:42,640
You--!

1196
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:44,210
Feed the pig.

1197
01:20:44,280 --> 01:20:47,080
I guess he's afraid of
Karnan's sister and mother.

1198
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:52,520
When my little sister died alone in the
middle of the road ten years back...

1199
01:20:52,620 --> 01:20:53,990
they knew I would do this someday.

1200
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:56,520
That's fine. But now a case
will be filed against everyone.

1201
01:20:56,620 --> 01:20:58,630
We'll never get those jobs.

1202
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,430
After generations of struggle,
we finally got an opportunity.

1203
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:05,200
-Now it's all gone to waste.
-Look...

1204
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:08,770
this notion that we should
somehow just get by...

1205
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:12,470
that is the handle to the baggage
they use to weigh us down.

1206
01:21:13,070 --> 01:21:14,410
Shove that aside,
and go away.

1207
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:17,740
You forced me to go after it...
I don't care if it's gone.

1208
01:21:17,810 --> 01:21:18,980
Grandpa!

1209
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:20,310
Come out.

1210
01:21:28,990 --> 01:21:30,060
What is it, dear?

1211
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:32,390
Tell him to come out.
I need to talk to him.

1212
01:21:32,490 --> 01:21:34,630
He will come.

1213
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:37,000
Go now. Tell your mother
not to be afraid.

1214
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:37,900
Go on, dear.

1215
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:40,770
I told you so many times,
and yet you dragged him into this.

1216
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:42,840
Say what you want about me.

1217
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:44,140
But he didn't do it.

1218
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:45,140
Go now.

1219
01:21:45,240 --> 01:21:46,370
Grandpa...

1220
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,640
I beg you like you were God.

1221
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:52,480
You wouldn't pin all the blame
on him, would you?

1222
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:55,620
Dear...

1223
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,090
not as long as I am alive.

1224
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,620
Go now.
Go on, dear.

1225
01:21:59,820 --> 01:22:01,890
Trust Grandpa.
Go home now.

1226
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:50,040
First, tell us who flung that stone.

1227
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:50,940
Tell us!

1228
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:52,970
We all wished to fling that stone.

1229
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,240
Nobody knows who did it.

1230
01:22:54,370 --> 01:22:56,740
You shut up.
You're the instigator.

1231
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,810
Why does everyone always blame him?

1232
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,950
We flung that stone to stop the bus,
and it sure did.

1233
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,820
We take complete responsibility.
We'll face the consequences.

1234
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,390
Son of Priest!
Don't talk like some big-shot.

1235
01:23:08,490 --> 01:23:10,020
Do you even know
how we found this place?

1236
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:13,390
We slaved like mules to turn
this wasteland into a civilization.

1237
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:14,860
Ask your father.

1238
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,700
The police will storm in here
and ransack everything.

1239
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,430
That's when you'll know it's worth.

1240
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,820
What's everyone yapping for?

1241
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:45,330
Let's hand them over
to the police.

1242
01:23:45,390 --> 01:23:48,300
I did warn you not to trust them,
that they'd land us in trouble.

1243
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,060
-And now they have.
-This guy will destroy our village.

1244
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:53,370
You coward! Why should you
hand us over to the police?

1245
01:23:53,430 --> 01:23:55,500
Run and hide someplace safe,
like you always do.

1246
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:58,070
If the village says so,
we will turn ourselves in.

1247
01:23:58,140 --> 01:23:59,740
You shut your mouth, alright?

1248
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:02,780
I should shut my mouth?
The police will arrive shortly.

1249
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:04,240
You'll see whose mouth gets shut.

1250
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:05,950
Fine, we'll see.
Now shut up.

1251
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:08,450
-What's the name of this village?
-Podiyankulam, sir.

1252
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,520
Podiyankulam...

1253
01:24:12,020 --> 01:24:13,250
What's it like?

1254
01:24:13,450 --> 01:24:16,620
-Any prior records against them?
-They are an arrogant lot, sir.

1255
01:24:16,890 --> 01:24:18,730
But no prior records.

1256
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:20,630
If there's a conflict, they resolve it
amongst themselves.

1257
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:22,500
-Amongst themselves?
-Yes, sir.

1258
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:25,000
So everyone in the village must
belong to the same community.

1259
01:24:25,070 --> 01:24:27,100
Why are you quiet, brother?

1260
01:24:27,330 --> 01:24:30,470
How long will you stay mum?
Give us a verdict.

1261
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:32,310
They are on the way.

1262
01:24:32,410 --> 01:24:34,140
-Where are the others?
-Others?

1263
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:35,640
What do you mean, brother?

1264
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,410
That's all of them.

1265
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,480
There is another.
Tell him to come.

1266
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:45,850
What's she doing here?

1267
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:48,160
Dear, why are you
bringing forth your son?

1268
01:24:48,490 --> 01:24:50,890
We were involved in
wrecking that bus, too.

1269
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,990
My husband, my son, and I.

1270
01:24:53,060 --> 01:24:54,660
And my unborn child, too.

1271
01:24:54,730 --> 01:24:56,760
Did your son fling that stone?

1272
01:24:56,860 --> 01:25:00,430
It either happened for the future
of our village, or for my child.

1273
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:02,500
It's up to the village to tell me...
which is it?

1274
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:04,140
Why did they wreck the bus?

1275
01:25:04,470 --> 01:25:06,070
Sir, they have no bus stop.

1276
01:25:06,140 --> 01:25:07,570
None of the buses stop
at this junction.

1277
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,210
They were running around
filing petitions for it.

1278
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:12,080
And now, this.

1279
01:25:12,150 --> 01:25:15,150
So they're not part of the
'We Don't Want Buses' brigade.

1280
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,450
They're the 'We Want Buses' brigade.

1281
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:21,050
We wished to fling that stone, too.
But that's not the problem.

1282
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,820
We toiled in this land pounding stones,
and now it's all in vain!

1283
01:25:23,890 --> 01:25:26,560
We hoped you people would study
and uplift the village.

1284
01:25:26,660 --> 01:25:28,530
But now you've got
a police record.

1285
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:30,260
How will you get a government job now?

1286
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,030
How will any of us get a
government job now?

1287
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:32,930
Why not?

1288
01:25:33,030 --> 01:25:35,070
Why not?
Let us take the blame.

1289
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:37,240
So many of us old men
will likely die soon anyway.

1290
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,470
-Let us turn ourselves in.
-Why should you?

1291
01:25:39,570 --> 01:25:40,570
Be quiet!

1292
01:25:40,740 --> 01:25:42,280
I'd like to see who can get past us
and arrest them.

1293
01:25:42,380 --> 01:25:43,210
Why?

1294
01:25:43,280 --> 01:25:45,610
You were so arrogant after
winning the village sword,

1295
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:47,920
you marched like warriors
without village consensus.

1296
01:25:47,980 --> 01:25:49,980
Why should we get involved now?
Is this a joke?

1297
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:51,450
Leave the village out of this.

1298
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:52,920
What rubbish?

1299
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:55,660
He only stood up for the village.
When did buses ever stop here?

1300
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,390
That had to be done.

1301
01:25:57,490 --> 01:25:59,460
Vadamalayan, you are wrong.

1302
01:25:59,660 --> 01:26:02,100
-The village must stand together.
-They're destroying us.

1303
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,100
-Why are you yelling at me?
-Don't pull us apart.

1304
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:07,500
-Don't point at me.
-You mind your business.

1305
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:22,520
Stop shouting!

1306
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:26,090
This had to happen someday.
And now it has.

1307
01:26:26,150 --> 01:26:27,390
Let our village be known
for something.

1308
01:26:27,490 --> 01:26:29,490
Together, we have no one to fear.

1309
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:31,690
Does the village stand united?
Tell me that.

1310
01:26:31,790 --> 01:26:33,290
The village does stand united.

1311
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,530
If you can't protect our sons,
we will protect them.

1312
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:38,730
Yes, we are in this together.
Who would let the village down?

1313
01:26:39,770 --> 01:26:42,440
Now that the village has
reached consensus, make a decision.

1314
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:44,400
-No need to keep yapping...
-It's done, then.

1315
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:46,110
Let the police come into the village.

1316
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:48,410
Worst case, will they behead us?
We will see this through.

1317
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:52,950
Fine, then. If a case is registered,
the village will handle it.

1318
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:23,940
The police are here.
Run!

1319
01:27:37,020 --> 01:27:38,660
Why have they drawn him headless?

1320
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:40,490
I told you, sir.
They're an arrogant lot.

1321
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:42,330
Always up to something absurd.

1322
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,700
They worship a headless god,
draw headless portraits. They're nuts.

1323
01:27:51,610 --> 01:27:54,070
-What happened?
-So many policemen have come.

1324
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:55,480
Who is the village headman?

1325
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:56,640
Tell me, sir.

1326
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:58,410
Is there no one else?

1327
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,410
It is him.
What is the matter?

1328
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:02,580
-What's your name?
-Duryodanan.

1329
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,280
-Duryodanan?
-Yes.

1330
01:28:06,150 --> 01:28:07,550
-Your name?
-Abhimanyu, sir.

1331
01:28:07,790 --> 01:28:09,560
They call me Abhimannan,
King Abhimanyu.

1332
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:11,060
Didn't I tell you, sir?

1333
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:13,290
Though they're paupers,
they're royalty.

1334
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,160
The names they've given themselves!

1335
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:18,570
Are you descendants of emperors now?

1336
01:28:18,730 --> 01:28:20,430
You have strange names.

1337
01:28:20,570 --> 01:28:23,940
Those of us named Maadasamy, Cattle God,
are not descendants of cattle.

1338
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,110
Name yourself as you like.

1339
01:28:26,270 --> 01:28:28,440
Did you know your boys
vandalised a bus?

1340
01:28:28,540 --> 01:28:30,410
-We didn't know.
-Vandalised a bus?

1341
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,250
-We heard there was an accident.
-Accident?

1342
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:36,080
A complaint has been filed
against your boys.

1343
01:28:36,180 --> 01:28:38,520
I've brought an eye-witness with me.
Want to see?

1344
01:28:40,150 --> 01:28:42,360
Sir, our boys wouldn't do such a thing.

1345
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:45,130
They're desperately trying to join
the police or military.

1346
01:28:45,290 --> 01:28:47,290
-How could they do it?
-Oh, yeah?

1347
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,500
Line them all up.

1348
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,170
Let me see the faces of aspiring
police and military-men.

1349
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:57,770
Will you call them now,
or should we search every household?

1350
01:28:57,870 --> 01:28:59,770
Sir, the entire village is here.

1351
01:28:59,870 --> 01:29:00,810
See for yourself.

1352
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:02,410
So this is your entire village?

1353
01:29:02,480 --> 01:29:03,980
You want me to believe that?

1354
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:07,150
-Raghupathy...
-Sir?

1355
01:29:08,250 --> 01:29:09,920
Ask him to take off that turban.

1356
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:12,420
Won't take off the turban
while you speak, M'Lord?

1357
01:29:12,490 --> 01:29:15,690
He's the chief farmer.
He must wear the turban at all times.

1358
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:19,130
What happened?

1359
01:29:20,060 --> 01:29:22,060
Don't ask me.
Ask them.

1360
01:29:22,530 --> 01:29:23,930
Search for them.

1361
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:25,930
We did, sir.
None of them are here.

1362
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:27,400
They've all gone into hiding.

1363
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,940
Sir, they're hiding them.

1364
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:33,270
Isn't that obvious?

1365
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,780
-Interrogate them.
-I will, sir. Please have a seat.

1366
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:39,010
Where am I supposed to sit?

1367
01:29:39,150 --> 01:29:41,280
Can't you see he's standing?
Bring him a chair.

1368
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:43,180
-Bring a chair.
-Okay, brother.

1369
01:29:43,750 --> 01:29:47,990
Don't think you can
get away by remaining silent.

1370
01:29:48,060 --> 01:29:49,860
-Son, come here.
-Grandma?

1371
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:51,990
-Come here.
-Yes, Grandma.

1372
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:53,730
Grandma needs to...

1373
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:55,230
What?

1374
01:29:55,400 --> 01:29:57,530
Grandma needs to piss.

1375
01:29:57,900 --> 01:30:00,100
-Okay, Grandma.
-Carry me gently.

1376
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:03,600
You obstruct vehicles on the road
by dancing on elephants.

1377
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:04,970
Countless atrocities!

1378
01:30:07,910 --> 01:30:09,380
Should I list them all?

1379
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:15,120
Why did we let that slide?

1380
01:30:15,450 --> 01:30:17,820
Because we knew you would
get caught someday.

1381
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:19,650
And today, you have all been caught.

1382
01:30:19,990 --> 01:30:23,360
If you don't tell us the truth,
we'll lock up every one of you.

1383
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:25,160
So you're all going to prison, eh?

1384
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:27,330
Let's do this, then?
-Sir.

1385
01:30:27,390 --> 01:30:28,830
Sir... sir...

1386
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,500
What?

1387
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:33,600
You make me stand
while you interrogate them?

1388
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:35,540
Get lost.

1389
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,440
I won't ask again!

1390
01:30:37,540 --> 01:30:40,540
If you don't speak up,
I will skin you alive.

1391
01:30:40,640 --> 01:30:42,580
-Where are they?
-What now?

1392
01:30:42,640 --> 01:30:44,080
-What?
-What do you want us to say?

1393
01:30:44,140 --> 01:30:46,850
You did nothing for us when we
asked for a bus all these years.

1394
01:30:46,950 --> 01:30:49,680
Now you're yelling at us when
someone somewhere vandalised a bus.

1395
01:30:49,780 --> 01:30:50,750
How can we help it?

1396
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:52,090
-Sir?
-What?

1397
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,950
-That's the boy who flung the stone.
-Who?

1398
01:30:54,520 --> 01:30:55,390
-That kid.
-Move!

1399
01:30:55,490 --> 01:30:56,860
You hid this little brat?

1400
01:30:56,960 --> 01:30:59,160
-You tested my patience.
-How can you hit a child?

1401
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:01,230
Get your hand off me.

1402
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:04,230
Stand back!

1403
01:31:04,330 --> 01:31:06,900
Sir, he's just a child.
I will tell you the truth.

1404
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,100
Fine, it was our boys who did it.
Let the child go.

1405
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:12,440
-Vadamalayan, what are you doing?
-Brother, be quiet.

1406
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:15,980
They're taking a little boy in.
Want me to keep quiet?

1407
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:19,650
We yelled ourselves hoarse all this time
and you said nothing.

1408
01:31:19,750 --> 01:31:20,850
It was your men all along?

1409
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:22,950
You took us for fools?
Bring them out.

1410
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,420
Stop staring at me.
Call them.

1411
01:31:25,990 --> 01:31:28,820
You did admit to wrecking it.
What are you gawking at?

1412
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,990
Call them. Call them now.

1413
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,390
Call them.

1414
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:34,860
They're young men.
Let us handle it.

1415
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Handle what?

1416
01:31:36,400 --> 01:31:38,400
You want to drag
the whole village into this?

1417
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:41,270
They know everything anyway.

1418
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:44,240
You cannot save anybody.
Call them!

1419
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:46,140
Will you call them, or shall I?

1420
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:47,640
Call them.

1421
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:01,280
Is this all of them?
Or were there others?

1422
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:03,680
No, there was a pregnant woman
and her son... that kid.

1423
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:05,520
So you wrecked a bus...

1424
01:33:06,250 --> 01:33:09,320
Break their arms, and they can't
wipe their butts, let alone lift a stone.

1425
01:33:09,390 --> 01:33:10,490
Sir...

1426
01:33:10,660 --> 01:33:12,660
they're young men.
Don't blow this up, sir.

1427
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:14,900
-If you file a case--
-Get your hand off me!

1428
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,700
Sir, get your hands off.
Get your hands off!

1429
01:33:18,030 --> 01:33:19,770
-We vandalised the bus.
-Stand back.

1430
01:33:20,100 --> 01:33:23,000
I did it. File a case against me,
if you want.

1431
01:33:23,070 --> 01:33:24,240
Don't touch our elders.

1432
01:33:24,300 --> 01:33:26,740
We wrecked a bus, it won't take us
long to wreck your jeep.

1433
01:33:26,810 --> 01:33:27,910
Come with me.

1434
01:33:27,980 --> 01:33:29,810
-Let him go.
-Stand back!

1435
01:33:29,910 --> 01:33:32,150
-Don't shove us.
-Get back.

1436
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:36,250
Sir!

1437
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,150
Don't do this, sir.

1438
01:33:38,250 --> 01:33:40,450
Don't raise your hand
at a senior.

1439
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:47,560
Sir, please let go.
It will blow up.

1440
01:33:47,900 --> 01:33:49,760
-Let us deal with this, sir.
-Tell them that.

1441
01:33:49,860 --> 01:33:51,330
Sir, I must speak with you.

1442
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:52,670
-Sir, let's talk...
-Why?

1443
01:33:52,770 --> 01:33:55,240
-Talk about what?
-Let's step aside, sir.

1444
01:33:55,340 --> 01:33:56,670
-Hold him.
-I will, sir.

1445
01:33:56,770 --> 01:33:57,910
Please come, sir.

1446
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:03,410
Let go! Get your hands off.

1447
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,450
-They are talking.
-Get back!

1448
01:34:05,510 --> 01:34:06,680
Nobody lays a hand.

1449
01:34:06,780 --> 01:34:10,350
Sir, I thought a few men
vandalised the bus.

1450
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:12,750
But the entire village
has mobilised here.

1451
01:34:13,150 --> 01:34:15,660
If I get in the middle of this,
my business will be ruined.

1452
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:16,860
This is a serious matter.

1453
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,790
Don't you know about the riots
all over Tamil Nadu over buses?

1454
01:34:19,860 --> 01:34:22,100
Sir, this has nothing
to do with that.

1455
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:23,900
Please don't make this
about that.

1456
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,930
I will talk it out
and resolve the matter.

1457
01:34:26,030 --> 01:34:27,570
Where are you taking it?

1458
01:34:27,670 --> 01:34:30,200
My son's troubles started
when he got this wretched thing.

1459
01:34:30,270 --> 01:34:31,770
I'm dumping it in the pit.

1460
01:34:31,870 --> 01:34:34,270
It doesn't belong to us. How will you
explain it to the village?

1461
01:34:34,370 --> 01:34:36,240
The village won't do squat.
What do they need a sword for?

1462
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:39,850
We don't know what will happen
to our son today. Don't do this.

1463
01:34:39,950 --> 01:34:40,980
Oh, shut up.

1464
01:34:41,150 --> 01:34:42,520
"Village sword," he says.

1465
01:34:42,750 --> 01:34:45,450
None of this would have happened
if we'd gotten rid of it.

1466
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:46,950
What's going to happen now?

1467
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:49,390
They wrecked your bus today
for some reason.

1468
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:52,330
If they wreck another bus in the future
for the reasons I stated,

1469
01:34:52,390 --> 01:34:54,660
-would you still ask me to do nothing?
-Sir...

1470
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,900
Just file it as an accident and
help me out. We'll take care of you.

1471
01:34:58,030 --> 01:34:59,700
So you want me to let them go,
and do nothing?

1472
01:34:59,770 --> 01:35:03,040
Sir, it doesn't have to be for nothing.
Please do this for me, I'll repay you.

1473
01:35:03,340 --> 01:35:05,110
Ladies, get inside.
Calm down.

1474
01:35:05,310 --> 01:35:07,410
-Go and tell them yourself.
-Thank you, sir!

1475
01:35:10,780 --> 01:35:11,810
Sir, chair.

1476
01:35:12,580 --> 01:35:14,150
I don't need a bloody chair now.

1477
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:21,660
Everybody, calm down.

1478
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:22,990
Be quiet!

1479
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:25,060
Just hear me out.

1480
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:31,270
I wish this hadn't happened,
but it has.

1481
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:33,870
Not stopping the bus was our bad.

1482
01:35:34,740 --> 01:35:36,840
But worse on your part
to have vandalised the bus.

1483
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:38,770
There is no bus stop there.

1484
01:35:39,070 --> 01:35:41,610
If we make a stop there,
we'll lose our license.

1485
01:35:41,710 --> 01:35:44,040
That is why my driver
couldn't stop there.

1486
01:35:44,110 --> 01:35:46,750
Sir, this man has gone bonkers.

1487
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:48,920
He's a bus owner.
He got scared.

1488
01:35:50,450 --> 01:35:51,520
What do we do now?

1489
01:35:52,250 --> 01:35:53,350
We wait.

1490
01:35:53,450 --> 01:35:57,820
I will stop my bus at your village
once every day, to-and-fro.

1491
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:01,500
Are you happy now?

1492
01:36:01,560 --> 01:36:02,830
Are you happy?

1493
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:06,100
Moreover, I will also retract
the complaint I had filed.

1494
01:36:07,370 --> 01:36:09,540
-I'll be off then?
-Thank you so much, sir.

1495
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,140
Stop touching people's feet!

1496
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:12,770
Lift up Karnan!

1497
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:19,410
-Raghupathy...
-Sir?

1498
01:36:19,750 --> 01:36:21,450
We can't bank on his word
and let it go.

1499
01:36:21,780 --> 01:36:22,780
Do something.

1500
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:25,750
Have the vandals come to the station
and get their statement.

1501
01:36:25,820 --> 01:36:26,820
Right, sir.

1502
01:36:38,900 --> 01:36:40,030
Look here!

1503
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:43,070
We can't walk away just because
the owner retracted his case.

1504
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:44,370
This is a serious offense.

1505
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:46,140
Those who vandalised the bus...

1506
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:48,080
must come to the station
and give a statement.

1507
01:36:48,140 --> 01:36:50,140
Then we'll let this matter go.
Okay?

1508
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:52,480
No way. We can't send our
young men to your station.

1509
01:36:52,750 --> 01:36:54,080
We elders will come.

1510
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,650
Brother, we should have
our leader's painting completed.

1511
01:37:28,750 --> 01:37:30,580
I feel that's the cause
for all this mess.

1512
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:33,090
It's the incomplete portrait
that frightened them.

1513
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:35,460
Only you people were frightened,
they weren't.

1514
01:37:35,790 --> 01:37:37,220
You were so shook up!

1515
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:41,360
He must have planned to take in
a few of us and beat us up.

1516
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:44,160
He mustn't have anticipated
the entire village's involvement.

1517
01:37:44,330 --> 01:37:46,830
He has not let us go.
He has gone to scheme.

1518
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:49,070
He could strike any moment.

1519
01:37:49,170 --> 01:37:50,340
We must be prepared.

1520
01:37:50,700 --> 01:37:52,370
What? Don't just bob your head.

1521
01:37:52,470 --> 01:37:53,440
Yes, dear?

1522
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:57,310
Grandpa, my mother threw away
the village sword into the pit.

1523
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:00,180
-Why would she do that?
-Where is he going?

1524
01:38:00,280 --> 01:38:01,580
-Your mother, I tell you...
-I have no idea...

1525
01:38:01,650 --> 01:38:03,180
She said the sword brought
all this hell upon us.

1526
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:04,150
There he goes!

1527
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:05,410
-You got it?
-Here.

1528
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:06,780
Give it to me.

1529
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:12,150
Is your mother crazy? How will she
explain this to the villagers?

1530
01:39:13,850 --> 01:39:15,220
Draupadi is here.

1531
01:39:15,320 --> 01:39:16,360
So what?

1532
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:18,130
-Go talk to her.
-You talk to her.

1533
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:20,460
Stop joking.
Just talk to her.

1534
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:21,860
That poor girl!

1535
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:25,070
-Let go! Let go!
-Talk to her.

1536
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:26,430
I said, let go!

1537
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:28,270
Are you crazy?

1538
01:39:28,540 --> 01:39:31,070
I said, don't--
Did your brother send you?

1539
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:32,770
You can scold me all you want.

1540
01:39:32,870 --> 01:39:35,980
I was angry with you thinking
you hit my brother over gambling money.

1541
01:39:36,310 --> 01:39:38,810
But when Grandpa told me,
do you know how bad I felt?

1542
01:39:38,910 --> 01:39:41,350
I wanted to throw him to the ground
and kick him myself.

1543
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:42,620
Why didn't you?

1544
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:43,680
I will.

1545
01:39:44,020 --> 01:39:45,020
I will, for sure.

1546
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:46,150
Hit me if you want.

1547
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:48,060
Hit me.
I said, hit me.

1548
01:39:48,890 --> 01:39:50,020
Hit me!

1549
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,730
So you can get by
without talking to me?

1550
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:58,270
Get lost!

1551
01:40:26,830 --> 01:40:27,900
Hey, Karnan!

1552
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,700
All of you sent Grandpa off
in the police jeep yesterday...

1553
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,330
he's still not returned home.

1554
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:34,540
-He hasn't?
-No, he hasn't.

1555
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:37,000
I was up all night.
None of them returned.

1556
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:38,740
What's this?

1557
01:40:38,940 --> 01:40:40,140
How was I to know?

1558
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:42,540
-I thought they'd have returned.
-Come on!

1559
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:45,580
Go home. I'm sure it's nothing.
I'll go take a look.

1560
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:46,910
Come on.

1561
01:40:47,680 --> 01:40:49,620
Murugan, start the vehicle.

1562
01:40:50,350 --> 01:40:51,420
Hurry up!

1563
01:40:51,490 --> 01:40:52,590
Hop on.

1564
01:40:52,650 --> 01:40:55,190
They didn't return all night.
You didn't even check on them?

1565
01:40:55,290 --> 01:40:57,390
I was with you all night,
how could I have known?

1566
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:59,790
Don't take it out on me.
Let's go check.

1567
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,360
Where do we even look for them?

1568
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:14,440
Come on.
Watch it.

1569
01:41:14,710 --> 01:41:15,640
Come.

1570
01:41:22,150 --> 01:41:23,020
Stop!

1571
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:24,820
Who are you people?
Why are you here?

1572
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:27,390
-Sir, we're from Podiyankulam.
-Podiyankulam? So what?

1573
01:41:27,620 --> 01:41:29,490
Our village elders came to sign here.

1574
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:30,820
We sent them back yesterday.

1575
01:41:30,890 --> 01:41:31,890
What do you mean?

1576
01:41:31,990 --> 01:41:33,690
-They never returned.
-They didn't, sir.

1577
01:41:33,790 --> 01:41:35,730
I told you, they left.
Go away.

1578
01:41:35,830 --> 01:41:38,230
-The inspector will be here. Leave.
-They haven't returned.

1579
01:41:38,330 --> 01:41:40,500
-Go now.
-We shall meet him then.

1580
01:41:40,570 --> 01:41:41,740
Let the inspector come.

1581
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,870
-How can you say that?
-Fine, we'll go out...

1582
01:41:44,940 --> 01:41:46,240
We need to see them.

1583
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:48,240
Let's wait outside
until the inspector comes.

1584
01:41:48,310 --> 01:41:50,240
We are asking you because
they came here.

1585
01:41:50,310 --> 01:41:52,250
-Why are you throwing us out?
-Come, come on.

1586
01:41:52,510 --> 01:41:54,410
Okay, sir.
Let's just wait here.

1587
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,420
Where could they be?
I am scared.

1588
01:41:58,790 --> 01:42:00,250
Something doesn't seem right.

1589
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:02,690
Fine, let the inspector come.
We'll see.

1590
01:42:04,060 --> 01:42:06,290
We should have noticed last night.
How negligent.

1591
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,760
Son, did you see a few elderly men
at the station yesterday?

1592
01:42:08,860 --> 01:42:09,700
What?

1593
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:11,330
Did you see elderly men
at the station yesterday?

1594
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:12,430
No, I don't know.

1595
01:42:13,100 --> 01:42:15,240
-I didn't see anybody.
-You didn't go inside?

1596
01:42:15,340 --> 01:42:16,870
Did you happen to look inside?

1597
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:18,970
-I don't go inside. That kid does.
-Kid...

1598
01:42:19,570 --> 01:42:22,240
Did you see any elderly men
at the station yesterday?

1599
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:31,690
Give it to him.

1600
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:33,320
-You.
-Sir?

1601
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:35,390
Bring me their casefiles.

1602
01:42:36,190 --> 01:42:37,390
-These, sir?
-Yes.

1603
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:41,300
That's their tenth tea.
Ask if they'll buy us one, too.

1604
01:42:42,160 --> 01:42:43,060
Ask him.

1605
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:47,770
-Sir...
-Yes?

1606
01:42:47,900 --> 01:42:49,670
We shall drink tea, too,
and come back.

1607
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,240
The inspector will be here soon.

1608
01:42:51,310 --> 01:42:53,210
Just a while longer.
Stand over there.

1609
01:42:53,270 --> 01:42:54,810
Sir, when will he come?

1610
01:42:54,980 --> 01:42:56,610
-Anytime now.
-How long can we stand?

1611
01:42:56,710 --> 01:42:58,280
He'll be here soon.

1612
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:00,650
We'll come back tomorrow
and give our statement.

1613
01:43:01,080 --> 01:43:02,950
I said, you can't just leave.

1614
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:04,350
-He will be here soon.
-Sir!

1615
01:43:04,520 --> 01:43:05,820
-When will he come?
-Shortly.

1616
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,020
These are elderly people.

1617
01:43:07,120 --> 01:43:10,190
You've had several cups of tea
but you didn't even offer us water.

1618
01:43:10,290 --> 01:43:12,530
You won't buy us tea.
At least let us go and get some.

1619
01:43:12,630 --> 01:43:14,060
-Let us go.
-Okay, he's here.

1620
01:43:14,230 --> 01:43:16,830
-The inspector is here. Be quiet.
-You keep saying that.

1621
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:19,570
Sir, the SP is coming too.

1622
01:43:19,830 --> 01:43:22,070
What's the commotion?

1623
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:24,140
-I could hear it outside.
-Sir.

1624
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:25,640
Sir...

1625
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:29,410
They've been shouting about
wanting to leave. What could I do?

1626
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:31,910
You won't stand in the police station?

1627
01:43:31,980 --> 01:43:34,350
We've been standing
since evening.

1628
01:43:34,480 --> 01:43:35,820
So what?
Will it kill you?

1629
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:37,350
How long can we stand?

1630
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:39,420
They've made us stand here
like criminals.

1631
01:43:39,950 --> 01:43:41,390
Why, aren't you people criminals?

1632
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:42,990
Didn't your whole village
vandalise a bus and hide?

1633
01:43:43,960 --> 01:43:45,390
Sir, that's over now.

1634
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,990
The case has been retracted.

1635
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:49,500
Should I salute you now that
the case has been retracted?

1636
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:52,700
You needn't salute us, but isn't there
a bench for us to sit on?

1637
01:43:52,770 --> 01:43:53,600
A bench?

1638
01:43:53,700 --> 01:43:56,440
If there isn't a bench in
the police station, you won't stand?

1639
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:58,270
I stood before you
for such a long time.

1640
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:01,140
-Did you offer me a bench?
-Fine, sir. Let it go.

1641
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,580
Tell us where to sign.
We'll sign and leave.

1642
01:44:03,640 --> 01:44:06,010
-You dare to interrupt me?
-Sir, what's this? Stop!

1643
01:44:06,980 --> 01:44:08,950
You brought us down here
to sign a statement.

1644
01:44:09,020 --> 01:44:11,820
-You're manhandling an elder.
-You dare to touch a policeman?

1645
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:13,790
Sir, don't!
Sir, why are you hitting?

1646
01:44:13,850 --> 01:44:15,320
Sir, what did we do?

1647
01:44:15,390 --> 01:44:17,020
Sir, don't do this...
please.

1648
01:44:17,220 --> 01:44:19,060
Sir, forgive me.
Please don't...

1649
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:20,730
Hey, shut the door.

1650
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:22,160
Shut the door!

1651
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:24,500
Show these strutters
who a policeman is.

1652
01:44:24,570 --> 01:44:25,830
-Sir! Sir!
-Oh, no!

1653
01:44:26,100 --> 01:44:27,700
You dare to touch a policeman?

1654
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:30,170
-You dare to touch a policeman?
-Sir!

1655
01:44:30,370 --> 01:44:32,370
"Sir?" What do you mean by "sir?"

1656
01:44:32,540 --> 01:44:34,640
Why "sir?"

1657
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:36,310
Who's "sir" here?

1658
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:38,480
"Sir?" Why?
Why?

1659
01:44:38,680 --> 01:44:40,580
Not so cocky now?
Who's "sir?"

1660
01:44:40,980 --> 01:44:42,850
Now you're meek, huh?

1661
01:44:43,020 --> 01:44:44,180
Now you're being meek?

1662
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:45,450
Hey, you...

1663
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:46,650
Let us go, sir.

1664
01:44:46,750 --> 01:44:48,190
-You...
-Let us go, sir.

1665
01:44:48,460 --> 01:44:50,620
-"You?"
-Please...

1666
01:44:50,890 --> 01:44:53,560
-Did you just say "you?"
-Please don't do this, sir.

1667
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:55,430
"You?"
Did you say "you?"

1668
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:56,830
Let the poor old man go.

1669
01:44:56,900 --> 01:44:58,870
Sir, please let us go.

1670
01:44:58,930 --> 01:45:00,270
So you wanted a bench?

1671
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:02,000
Go under the bench.

1672
01:45:02,070 --> 01:45:03,770
I can't take it!

1673
01:45:04,270 --> 01:45:05,440
No, no, no!

1674
01:45:05,610 --> 01:45:07,570
-Didn't you ask for a bench?
-It hurts!

1675
01:45:07,640 --> 01:45:08,980
Please don't hit us.

1676
01:45:09,110 --> 01:45:10,980
Tell me now.
What's your name?

1677
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:13,280
What's your name?
Say it.

1678
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:15,180
-Duryodanan, sir.
-Duryodanan!

1679
01:45:15,820 --> 01:45:16,780
Are you Duryodanan?

1680
01:45:16,850 --> 01:45:17,950
'You' are Duryodanan?

1681
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,690
-What's your father's name?
-Let us go, sir.

1682
01:45:20,850 --> 01:45:22,490
-Tell me!
-Maadasamy, sir.

1683
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,530
Maadasamy's son is Duryodanan now?

1684
01:45:24,860 --> 01:45:27,960
You thought you could change your names
and become kings overnight?

1685
01:45:28,060 --> 01:45:30,400
Which kingdom do you kings rule over?
Answer me!

1686
01:45:30,500 --> 01:45:32,270
-Let us go...
-What's your name?

1687
01:45:32,400 --> 01:45:34,600
Arjunan? Or Bheeman?
Tell me.

1688
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:37,040
-Vadamalayan, sir.
-Why were you named Vadamalayan?

1689
01:45:37,100 --> 01:45:38,370
-Tell me!
-I don't know, sir.

1690
01:45:38,440 --> 01:45:40,210
What's Vadamalayan now?

1691
01:45:40,270 --> 01:45:42,280
Why Vadamalayan?
Why Vadamalayan?

1692
01:45:42,610 --> 01:45:44,980
We're supposed to fear you
as you've changed your names?

1693
01:45:45,150 --> 01:45:46,810
Put on your turban.
Put on your turban.

1694
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:48,320
Put it on!

1695
01:45:48,420 --> 01:45:50,620
You're the chief farmer?
Won't take off your turban?

1696
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:52,490
Put it on!
Put it on!

1697
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:56,190
Why are your hands shaking now?
A turban!

1698
01:45:56,290 --> 01:45:57,820
A turban?
You dare to wear a turban?

1699
01:45:57,890 --> 01:45:59,190
Sir, don't do this...

1700
01:45:59,290 --> 01:46:01,030
Sir, he will die... don't!

1701
01:46:01,200 --> 01:46:02,660
-Don't do this, sir...
-Let him die!

1702
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:03,930
Where's the other guy?

1703
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:05,830
Oh, you're hiding down here?

1704
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:09,940
Shawl on your shoulder?
You won't step out without it?

1705
01:46:10,100 --> 01:46:11,440
Come out!
I'll break your legs.

1706
01:46:20,980 --> 01:46:22,820
No, sir. No...

1707
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:44,440
As you wished...

1708
01:46:45,040 --> 01:46:46,040
toss them away.

1709
01:46:46,370 --> 01:46:48,540
Since it was a private bus
that they vandalised...

1710
01:46:48,610 --> 01:46:51,450
I spared them when
the owner begged me.

1711
01:46:51,650 --> 01:46:53,150
But these old men...

1712
01:46:53,250 --> 01:46:56,120
puff their chests, twirl their moustaches,
and stand proudly before me,

1713
01:46:56,180 --> 01:46:57,820
and you expect me to be quiet?

1714
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,120
What do we do, sir?

1715
01:46:59,190 --> 01:47:02,790
There are riots all over Tamil Nadu
with the bus issue...

1716
01:47:03,190 --> 01:47:04,560
lock them up under that case.

1717
01:47:04,730 --> 01:47:06,230
I'd like to see who questions me.

1718
01:47:57,140 --> 01:47:58,210
Grandpa!

1719
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,650
Grandpa!

1720
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,420
Grandpa!

1721
01:48:06,790 --> 01:48:07,860
Grandpa!

1722
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:14,390
Grandpa!

1723
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:18,230
Go!
Don't spare anybody.

1724
01:48:19,070 --> 01:48:20,100
Grandpa!

1725
01:48:47,900 --> 01:48:48,930
Grandpa!

1726
01:49:09,820 --> 01:49:11,690
CRIMINAL DIVISION

1727
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:14,100
What the hell?
Take that away from him.

1728
01:52:14,270 --> 01:52:16,600
What do you think you're doing?

1729
01:52:16,700 --> 01:52:18,940
Let go!
Take it from him, Karnan.

1730
01:52:19,140 --> 01:52:20,440
Let go!

1731
01:52:20,540 --> 01:52:22,140
Why would you do such a thing?

1732
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:23,980
What can I say?

1733
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:26,750
He didn't hit us because
we vandalised the bus.

1734
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:28,320
No.

1735
01:52:28,650 --> 01:52:30,020
He hit us because I wore a turban.

1736
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:31,290
He hit us because we stood tall.

1737
01:52:31,990 --> 01:52:34,860
He hit me because I, Maadasamy's son,
was named Duryodanan.

1738
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:38,290
I held on to my dear life
and brought it down here...

1739
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:40,460
only to see these cowards
scared witless?

1740
01:52:41,230 --> 01:52:43,030
I'd rather die.

1741
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:46,830
You nailed our coffins
by vandalising the police station.

1742
01:52:46,900 --> 01:52:49,570
-We're all dead meat anyway.
-I'll plunge this right in!

1743
01:52:49,670 --> 01:52:51,940
What? Let me go...

1744
01:52:52,040 --> 01:52:54,270
Come any closer,
and I'll plunge this into you.

1745
01:52:54,810 --> 01:52:56,040
What were we supposed to do?

1746
01:52:58,150 --> 01:53:00,650
They've maimed our village,
and robbed us of our dignity.

1747
01:53:00,980 --> 01:53:02,820
And you people are still afraid?

1748
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,020
What's the point of living like vermin?

1749
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:09,290
How many generations must suffer
like you people?

1750
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:11,830
Aren't you ashamed to say that
you'll run away with your children?

1751
01:53:14,190 --> 01:53:15,730
They didn't hit us for
vandalising the bus.

1752
01:53:16,160 --> 01:53:17,870
They hit us because
we held our heads high.

1753
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:19,930
Will you live your
entire lives crouched?

1754
01:53:20,600 --> 01:53:23,270
Anyone who believes they can,
walk away from here right now.

1755
01:53:23,370 --> 01:53:24,740
Nobody's holding you back.

1756
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:26,870
We've looked up now,
and held our heads high.

1757
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:29,640
We can never go back to crouching.

1758
01:53:31,810 --> 01:53:32,750
So now...

1759
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:34,650
we shall fight.

1760
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:37,020
Did everybody hear me?

1761
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:40,250
Police or military,
we will fight them all.

1762
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:28,770
Don't y'all give up, Papa

1763
01:54:29,940 --> 01:54:32,440
Don't y'all give up, Mama

1764
01:54:33,770 --> 01:54:36,380
Don't y'all give up, Papa

1765
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:40,180
Don't y'all give up, Mama

1766
01:54:41,420 --> 01:54:43,850
Don't y'all give up, Papa

1767
01:54:45,150 --> 01:54:48,020
Don't y'all give up, Mama

1768
01:54:48,860 --> 01:54:51,230
Don't y'all give up, Papa

1769
01:54:52,290 --> 01:54:54,630
Oh, Mama...

1770
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:36,700
Bobble, bumble -frogs and rice
Big, burly buffalo -buffalo milk

1771
01:55:36,770 --> 01:55:38,570
Binding burlap to the branch

1772
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:42,140
A beast with a beret
It's beckoning, it's bellowing

1773
01:55:42,280 --> 01:55:45,780
Dear son, don't be afraid
Dear daughter, don't be afraid

1774
01:55:45,850 --> 01:55:47,810
Native clan, don't be afraid

1775
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:50,250
Don't y'all give up, Papa

1776
01:55:51,490 --> 01:55:54,450
Don't y'all give up, Papa

1777
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:57,690
Don't y'all give up, Grandpa

1778
01:55:58,890 --> 01:56:01,960
Don't y'all give up, Grandma

1779
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:12,240
I'm the ancestral deity Kattupechi

1780
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:16,710
Can you hear my song within your ears?

1781
01:56:16,780 --> 01:56:19,610
I'm wilting in this hilltop

1782
01:56:20,610 --> 01:56:23,850
Can you see it
In the palm of your hands?

1783
01:56:24,150 --> 01:56:28,190
Don't y'all give up, Papa
Don't y'all give up, Mama

1784
01:56:28,360 --> 01:56:31,860
Don't y'all give up, Bro
Don't y'all give up, Sis

1785
01:56:31,960 --> 01:56:33,890
Don't y'all give up
Don't y'all give up

1786
01:56:33,990 --> 01:56:36,330
Don't y'all give up

1787
01:56:43,270 --> 01:56:46,440
Don't y'all give up
Don't y'all give up

1788
01:56:46,770 --> 01:56:50,040
Don't y'all give up
Don't y'all give up

1789
01:56:58,020 --> 01:57:01,660
Here they come, there they come
The wrathful devil in khaki uniform

1790
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:05,330
They come riding a berserk bull
They come to beat every being insight

1791
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:07,330
They come to burn our dreams to ashes

1792
01:57:07,390 --> 01:57:10,830
Dear son, don't be afraid
Dear daughter, don't be afraid

1793
01:57:10,900 --> 01:57:13,170
Native clan, don't be afraid

1794
01:57:17,800 --> 01:57:20,940
Come, obstruct their procession
And let's dance

1795
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:24,810
Come, stop those cyclical wheels
That trample us

1796
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:28,480
We're going to go around town,
Around the world

1797
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:31,590
Where are our wings?
Ask them to return it

1798
01:57:33,090 --> 01:57:36,390
Don't y'all give up, Papa
Don't y'all give up, Mama

1799
01:57:36,720 --> 01:57:40,360
Don't y'all give up, Grandpa
Don't y'all give up, Grandma

1800
01:57:40,460 --> 01:57:43,830
Don't y'all give up, Bro
Don't y'all give up, Sis

1801
01:57:44,060 --> 01:57:46,030
Don't y'all give up
Don't y'all give up

1802
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:47,900
Don't y'all give up

1803
01:57:48,170 --> 01:57:50,070
Don't y'all give up, Papa

1804
01:57:51,470 --> 01:57:54,140
Don't y'all give up, Mama

1805
01:57:55,280 --> 01:57:57,480
Don't y'all give up, Grandpa

1806
01:57:58,910 --> 01:58:01,680
Don't y'all give up, Grandma

1807
01:58:43,360 --> 01:58:44,990
Don't y'all give up
Don't y'all give up

1808
01:58:45,060 --> 01:58:46,860
Don't y'all give up

1809
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:48,660
Don't y'all give up
Don't y'all give up

1810
01:58:48,730 --> 01:58:50,100
Don't y'all give up

1811
01:58:54,230 --> 01:58:56,200
Don't y'all give up
Don't y'all give up

1812
01:58:56,270 --> 01:58:57,300
Don't y'all give up

1813
01:58:57,870 --> 01:58:59,710
Don't y'all give up
Don't y'all give up

1814
01:58:59,770 --> 01:59:01,210
Don't y'all give up

1815
01:59:01,940 --> 01:59:03,580
Don't y'all give up
Don't y'all give up

1816
01:59:03,640 --> 01:59:05,050
Don't y'all give up

1817
01:59:12,020 --> 01:59:13,190
What's this?

1818
01:59:13,590 --> 01:59:16,460
When they turned off the electricity,
I thought they'd come at night.

1819
01:59:16,520 --> 01:59:18,960
-But not a soul in sight.
-I was wondering that, too.

1820
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:21,500
When will they come?
How many will come?

1821
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:22,730
I feel my insides shaking.

1822
01:59:22,830 --> 01:59:25,500
-What will they do to us?
-Don't go around talking that way.

1823
01:59:25,770 --> 01:59:28,170
-You'll scare the boys.
-I didn't tell them.

1824
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:29,770
-Just between us.
-Go, now.

1825
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:31,470
Fine.

1826
01:59:31,710 --> 01:59:32,640
Come.

1827
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:35,880
Karnan...

1828
01:59:37,380 --> 01:59:38,850
Come here, I need to speak with you.

1829
01:59:45,820 --> 01:59:46,690
Sit.

1830
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:55,400
I can't even look you in the eye.

1831
01:59:56,830 --> 01:59:58,830
I have picked so many fights with you.

1832
02:00:00,330 --> 02:00:02,070
But I must tell you something.

1833
02:00:02,770 --> 02:00:05,370
The police hit me so badly,
I don't know how long I'll live.

1834
02:00:05,610 --> 02:00:08,110
I thought touching their feet
could help me get by.

1835
02:00:08,310 --> 02:00:10,710
But now I know they'll only
trample over us.

1836
02:00:11,250 --> 02:00:12,810
You were right all along, Karnan.

1837
02:00:14,010 --> 02:00:16,980
It's your anger that's awakened
the entire village.

1838
02:00:18,250 --> 02:00:19,950
And I took you for a kid!

1839
02:00:20,020 --> 02:00:21,190
One last thing...

1840
02:00:21,460 --> 02:00:23,990
take care of Draupadi,
like you take care of everyone.

1841
02:00:24,060 --> 02:00:26,230
Like everyone in the village,

1842
02:00:26,790 --> 02:00:28,300
I trust you.

1843
02:00:29,330 --> 02:00:30,330
Go.

1844
02:00:31,400 --> 02:00:32,570
Be careful.

1845
02:00:40,140 --> 02:00:41,140
Brother...

1846
02:00:41,380 --> 02:00:42,380
here.

1847
02:00:42,710 --> 02:00:43,780
No thanks. Go.

1848
02:00:43,980 --> 02:00:46,580
-Drink some.
-No, give it to them.

1849
02:01:01,130 --> 02:01:02,830
Looks like my brother spoke to you?

1850
02:01:05,270 --> 02:01:06,930
In the end, you changed even him.

1851
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:12,770
Why is your face swollen?

1852
02:01:13,370 --> 02:01:14,440
Are you afraid?

1853
02:01:15,980 --> 02:01:17,140
Who isn't afraid here?

1854
02:01:19,080 --> 02:01:21,750
But soon our village
will know its fate, right?

1855
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:28,660
You know, they'll capture me somehow.

1856
02:01:30,020 --> 02:01:30,990
I have known all along.

1857
02:01:32,630 --> 02:01:34,290
I decided you were mine
twelve years ago.

1858
02:01:36,100 --> 02:01:38,600
Just another five years, or ten.

1859
02:01:39,770 --> 02:01:40,770
I'll manage.

1860
02:01:44,710 --> 02:01:46,710
What if they murder me in there?

1861
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:05,790
Yeman, I thought they'd
attack us at night.

1862
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:07,830
But no one's come.
What's going on?

1863
02:02:07,900 --> 02:02:10,160
I was thinking the same thing.
The boys are asleep.

1864
02:02:10,400 --> 02:02:12,370
If they come storming in,
what do we do?

1865
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:14,070
Wonder what they're planning.

1866
02:02:14,170 --> 02:02:15,440
Yeman, someone's coming.

1867
02:02:17,300 --> 02:02:18,940
Who's that, coming all alone?

1868
02:02:19,370 --> 02:02:20,640
It's the postman.

1869
02:02:20,770 --> 02:02:22,440
Why has he come
so early in the morning?

1870
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,140
Come, let's take a look.

1871
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,350
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

1872
02:02:27,650 --> 02:02:29,680
There's a letter for Karnan
from your village.

1873
02:02:30,020 --> 02:02:32,990
They didn't deliver it due to
all the chaos. So I came early.

1874
02:02:33,090 --> 02:02:34,350
A letter for Karnan?
What is it?

1875
02:02:34,450 --> 02:02:36,790
It's good news.
He's been selected for CRPF.

1876
02:02:36,860 --> 02:02:38,490
Make sure you send him soon
with a clean record.

1877
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:39,390
Oh, Karnan!

1878
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:43,160
Hey, give it to me!

1879
02:02:43,230 --> 02:02:46,330
-He's triumphed.
-Look, Karnan has done it...

1880
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:48,940
-Everybody, come look!
-Karnan has done it.

1881
02:02:49,100 --> 02:02:50,770
-Look at this.
-What happened, Uncle?

1882
02:02:50,870 --> 02:02:52,440
-He's won!
-That's great news.

1883
02:02:52,610 --> 02:02:54,440
Come, let's show it to him.

1884
02:02:56,780 --> 02:02:57,980
Karnan!

1885
02:02:59,480 --> 02:03:01,250
-What is it?
-Take this.

1886
02:03:01,580 --> 02:03:03,580
-Open it!
-Tell me what it is.

1887
02:03:03,850 --> 02:03:05,990
You have won!
Open it and see.

1888
02:03:06,090 --> 02:03:08,890
This is a military order.
You got the job!

1889
02:03:09,520 --> 02:03:10,790
Here... look!

1890
02:03:11,060 --> 02:03:12,230
See...

1891
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:14,830
Is that all?
You scared me for a moment.

1892
02:03:14,900 --> 02:03:16,060
"Is that all?"

1893
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:18,030
This is such big news
for our village!

1894
02:03:18,100 --> 02:03:20,230
Yeah, whatever.
Toss it in the garbage.

1895
02:03:20,770 --> 02:03:22,340
Why toss it in the garbage?

1896
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:24,940
-You're annoying me now. Give me that.
-Wait!

1897
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:27,440
-Let go, I said let go!
-Don't tear it...

1898
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:30,310
-Are you mad?
-Don't you see what's happening?

1899
02:03:30,440 --> 02:03:32,250
-Let go.
-We'll handle everything.

1900
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:33,510
Just go for it.

1901
02:03:33,650 --> 02:03:36,350
-Karnan, what's going on here?
-Stop being so frantic.

1902
02:03:36,520 --> 02:03:38,420
We're all fighting for our lives here...

1903
02:03:38,490 --> 02:03:39,490
and you're squabbling?

1904
02:03:40,520 --> 02:03:42,120
What's happened? Tell me.

1905
02:03:42,190 --> 02:03:44,890
Brother, Karnan got a job
in the military.

1906
02:03:45,230 --> 02:03:46,660
But he wants to the order,
he's refusing to go.

1907
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:48,630
This is such good news.

1908
02:03:49,230 --> 02:03:50,730
Are you fighting over this?

1909
02:03:51,230 --> 02:03:52,670
We'll make him go.

1910
02:03:52,830 --> 02:03:53,900
Where should I go?

1911
02:03:56,100 --> 02:03:57,870
I started all of this.
Now should I run away?

1912
02:03:58,640 --> 02:04:01,240
Who said you're running away?
We're sending you off, happily.

1913
02:04:01,310 --> 02:04:03,110
Keep talking that way,
and I'll punch your face.

1914
02:04:03,210 --> 02:04:04,950
Stop, Karnan!

1915
02:04:05,050 --> 02:04:08,520
Karnan, we're all praying
for a government job.

1916
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:10,280
Now you have an opportunity at hand!

1917
02:04:10,350 --> 02:04:12,620
Go to work, son.
We'll take care of ourselves.

1918
02:04:12,690 --> 02:04:13,850
You're more important to us.

1919
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:15,520
Why are all of you
telling me to leave?

1920
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:19,360
We agreed to fight
the police or military.

1921
02:04:19,730 --> 02:04:20,960
Now you want me to join the military?

1922
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,560
When I return, will our village
still be here?

1923
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:26,330
We don't even know if the village
will survive for long...

1924
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:28,370
but you people are telling me to leave?

1925
02:04:28,940 --> 02:04:30,000
I can't leave.

1926
02:04:30,540 --> 02:04:31,710
Get to work, everybody.

1927
02:04:33,940 --> 02:04:34,940
Karnan...

1928
02:04:35,780 --> 02:04:36,940
What you say is true.

1929
02:04:38,150 --> 02:04:38,980
The police will come.

1930
02:04:39,750 --> 02:04:40,810
They will hit us again.

1931
02:04:41,080 --> 02:04:42,580
They will slap cases
against everyone.

1932
02:04:42,850 --> 02:04:44,020
They will raze the village
to the ground.

1933
02:04:44,590 --> 02:04:46,420
But the children that remain
should be able to survive.

1934
02:04:46,850 --> 02:04:48,460
It's for their sake
that you must go.

1935
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:50,520
I am telling you. Go.

1936
02:04:51,690 --> 02:04:53,560
Karnan, don't just stand there.

1937
02:04:53,860 --> 02:04:55,500
Didn't our village follow you?

1938
02:04:55,900 --> 02:04:57,870
Won't you do this for our village?

1939
02:04:57,930 --> 02:05:01,100
-I fall at your feet, please go...
-What the hell, brother?

1940
02:05:19,090 --> 02:05:20,150
What are you still thinking about?

1941
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:22,620
I wonder what they'll do
when they come.

1942
02:05:23,190 --> 02:05:25,690
They can't do a thing.
The collector is coming with them.

1943
02:05:25,890 --> 02:05:28,000
You think that will stop them?

1944
02:05:28,060 --> 02:05:29,230
What's it to you?

1945
02:05:29,330 --> 02:05:31,700
Don't worry, and just go.
I'll handle everything here.

1946
02:05:31,770 --> 02:05:32,670
Here.

1947
02:05:32,770 --> 02:05:33,930
What can you accomplish by yourself?

1948
02:05:34,030 --> 02:05:36,370
That's my problem. Take this.

1949
02:05:37,800 --> 02:05:39,410
-Take it.
-What's this for?

1950
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:42,310
This is your sword. Until you cross
the village, you must wield it.

1951
02:05:42,610 --> 02:05:43,610
Take it.

1952
02:05:43,710 --> 02:05:44,750
Take it.

1953
02:05:51,320 --> 02:05:52,250
Leave soon.

1954
02:06:39,170 --> 02:06:40,570
-Draupadi...
-Don't say a word.

1955
02:06:40,670 --> 02:06:42,670
Go. Just go!

1956
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,270
Wait.

1957
02:07:42,930 --> 02:07:44,230
What have they done, sir?

1958
02:07:44,770 --> 02:07:48,040
This is why I said we should come at
night, sir. They're not afraid of us.

1959
02:07:48,100 --> 02:07:51,370
Look, they've stayed up all night
and laid thorns around the village.

1960
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:52,770
They've dug trenches too.

1961
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:55,140
They seem prepared for the worst.

1962
02:07:55,280 --> 02:07:57,480
Let's just execute our plan.

1963
02:07:58,080 --> 02:07:59,110
Wait.

1964
02:07:59,310 --> 02:08:00,350
Let's try to parley.

1965
02:08:00,450 --> 02:08:01,520
Give him the order.

1966
02:08:01,850 --> 02:08:03,280
Hey, talk to them.

1967
02:08:06,690 --> 02:08:07,860
Look here...

1968
02:08:08,160 --> 02:08:09,520
Can you hear me?

1969
02:08:10,360 --> 02:08:11,560
The collector is here with us.

1970
02:08:11,660 --> 02:08:13,160
We've only come to parley.

1971
02:08:13,730 --> 02:08:15,830
Send the women and children away.

1972
02:08:16,360 --> 02:08:17,400
All of you men stay here.

1973
02:08:18,230 --> 02:08:19,270
Do you understand?

1974
02:08:22,270 --> 02:08:23,100
Go.

1975
02:08:44,890 --> 02:08:46,530
Only the collector may enter
the village for negotiations.

1976
02:08:47,690 --> 02:08:48,930
The police should not enter.

1977
02:08:49,260 --> 02:08:51,570
They said if you do enter,
they will hit back.

1978
02:08:51,900 --> 02:08:52,730
Let's go.

1979
02:08:55,100 --> 02:08:56,900
Did you hear that?
Such arrogance.

1980
02:08:57,970 --> 02:08:59,710
We can only control them with force.

1981
02:09:00,770 --> 02:09:01,810
Let's step in.

1982
02:09:04,950 --> 02:09:05,780
Be careful.

1983
02:09:06,650 --> 02:09:07,480
Don't open fire.

1984
02:09:08,480 --> 02:09:10,820
Arrest whomever you must arrest.

1985
02:09:13,790 --> 02:09:16,220
-I don't want a single casualty.
-Okay, sir.

1986
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:27,000
Let's stay and watch.

1987
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:31,100
Even without our spite,

1988
02:09:31,270 --> 02:09:34,270
their village is going to be ravaged
right before our eyes.

1989
02:09:34,940 --> 02:09:36,640
I don't want this blame on my hands.

1990
02:09:37,110 --> 02:09:37,950
Come.

1991
02:09:46,190 --> 02:09:48,890
Go, go, go!
Climb over it.

1992
02:09:48,990 --> 02:09:50,990
Throw it down.
Climb.

1993
02:09:51,530 --> 02:09:53,490
Walk over it.
Go!

1994
02:09:53,660 --> 02:09:55,560
Walk over it.
Get inside!

1995
02:09:59,270 --> 02:10:00,370
Hey!

1996
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:06,770
Hit them!

1997
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:47,450
Here, Brother.
Hit them.

1998
02:10:47,780 --> 02:10:49,650
Oh, God!

1999
02:11:18,210 --> 02:11:20,250
Go that way!

2000
02:11:38,900 --> 02:11:39,870
Die!

2001
02:11:55,980 --> 02:11:57,250
Hey!

2002
02:12:21,040 --> 02:12:23,540
Oh, God, protect us!

2003
02:12:24,650 --> 02:12:26,650
Don't hit my child!

2004
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,150
Please don't hit us.

2005
02:12:29,320 --> 02:12:30,620
Curse them!

2006
02:12:37,990 --> 02:12:39,660
My dear!

2007
02:12:39,730 --> 02:12:41,230
Please don't hit!

2008
02:12:54,240 --> 02:12:55,980
Don't hit my child!

2009
02:12:56,110 --> 02:12:57,980
Sir, sir... please.

2010
02:12:58,080 --> 02:12:59,180
Sir, please.

2011
02:12:59,450 --> 02:13:01,180
Don't hit my child!

2012
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:18,030
Let me go!

2013
02:13:21,240 --> 02:13:22,740
What do I do now?

2014
02:13:32,110 --> 02:13:34,480
You will rot in hell!

2015
02:13:41,520 --> 02:13:42,560
No!

2016
02:13:44,190 --> 02:13:45,630
Let go!

2017
02:13:45,690 --> 02:13:47,060
Get in here.

2018
02:14:05,310 --> 02:14:07,310
Let go!

2019
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:11,450
Let go!

2020
02:14:21,160 --> 02:14:22,400
My horse!

2021
02:14:25,030 --> 02:14:26,430
My horse...

2022
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:30,100
Stop!

2023
02:14:37,280 --> 02:14:38,480
Don't hit us, please.

2024
02:14:41,320 --> 02:14:42,780
Why'd he...

2025
02:14:44,320 --> 02:14:46,920
You dare misbehave again?
Such arrogance.

2026
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:30,400
Pull the baby out, fool!

2027
02:15:43,780 --> 02:15:45,610
So what if the collector is coming?

2028
02:15:45,980 --> 02:15:47,280
What can you accomplish
by yourself?

2029
02:15:47,980 --> 02:15:50,280
That's my problem.
Why are you afraid? Here.

2030
02:16:20,850 --> 02:16:22,650
What are you doing?

2031
02:16:24,850 --> 02:16:26,420
Yeman, what's wrong with you?

2032
02:16:26,490 --> 02:16:28,390
-Get away from me...
-Please listen to us.

2033
02:16:28,520 --> 02:16:30,720
Don't you people see what's going on?

2034
02:16:30,820 --> 02:16:33,390
-This is not the solution.
-Get away from me.

2035
02:16:34,390 --> 02:16:38,900
Only by sacrificing one life here
can everyone's life be saved out there.

2036
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:06,990
Grandpa!

2037
02:17:08,560 --> 02:17:09,700
Grandpa!

2038
02:17:10,530 --> 02:17:11,870
They burned him!

2039
02:17:21,480 --> 02:17:22,640
Grandpa!

2040
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:49,770
Grandpa!

2041
02:17:51,070 --> 02:17:52,270
Grandpa!

2042
02:17:58,950 --> 02:18:00,180
Grandpa!

2043
02:18:15,230 --> 02:18:16,230
What is it, son?

2044
02:18:16,700 --> 02:18:18,230
Come on. Let's go.

2045
02:18:18,900 --> 02:18:20,100
I can't.

2046
02:18:21,030 --> 02:18:23,570
-I won't leave the village.
-Don't say that.

2047
02:18:23,900 --> 02:18:25,270
I'm begging you.

2048
02:18:25,470 --> 02:18:27,470
Something good has finally
come our way.

2049
02:18:27,810 --> 02:18:30,210
-Don't ruin it.
-What are you saying, Dad?

2050
02:18:30,780 --> 02:18:31,910
Something's going on there.

2051
02:18:32,650 --> 02:18:33,910
I can hear it inside my head.

2052
02:18:34,310 --> 02:18:37,020
I can hear the entire village wailing
inside my head. Let me go!

2053
02:18:37,180 --> 02:18:39,290
Nothing's going on there.
Come, let's go.

2054
02:18:39,620 --> 02:18:41,820
-Are you deaf, Man?
-Please.

2055
02:18:41,890 --> 02:18:44,220
My head will explode
if I take another step.

2056
02:18:44,320 --> 02:18:47,900
-Let go of me...
-Karnan, listen to your father.

2057
02:20:10,480 --> 02:20:11,410
Don't go...

2058
02:20:11,480 --> 02:20:13,750
If you don't let go,
I'll choke you to death.

2059
02:20:13,810 --> 02:20:16,150
-I am telling you, I must go.
-No.

2060
02:20:21,190 --> 02:20:23,360
Brother Karnan!

2061
02:20:24,390 --> 02:20:26,160
Brother Karnan!

2062
02:20:35,070 --> 02:20:37,400
They set Grandpa Yeman ablaze
and killed him.

2063
02:20:38,640 --> 02:20:41,410
They killed him.

2064
02:20:41,940 --> 02:20:43,410
They killed Grandpa.

2065
02:20:44,580 --> 02:20:45,750
Grandpa Yeman...

2066
02:20:45,810 --> 02:20:48,320
They ransacked our village.

2067
02:20:52,490 --> 02:20:53,820
Our village...

2068
02:22:21,780 --> 02:22:27,450
My sandal tree, my vilva tree
You're reached God's tree of verses

2069
02:22:27,510 --> 02:22:32,190
The tree of jasmine bloom
The tree where snakes make a home

2070
02:22:32,690 --> 02:22:37,890
My love, in the world you've departed
The snake doesn't return to the hole

2071
02:22:38,060 --> 02:22:41,530
Even the oceans go parched
without you

2072
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:47,430
My master, my precious...

2073
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:53,140
In a world without you
There's no one to respect us

2074
02:22:57,410 --> 02:23:02,950
Under the kungumasandhi tree
There's no cool shade today

2075
02:23:03,620 --> 02:23:09,390
In a world without you
There's no one to beckon the Gods

2076
02:23:14,190 --> 02:23:17,430
I built a concrete house, my precious

2077
02:23:17,530 --> 02:23:20,870
I laid a beautiful black form like you

2078
02:23:20,930 --> 02:23:23,540
Karnan, I am your ancestor Kattupechi
calling out to you.

2079
02:23:23,600 --> 02:23:26,570
Don't spare anybody, Karnan.
Hit them back, chase them away.

2080
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,480
Hit them back,
chase them away!

2081
02:23:31,140 --> 02:23:33,450
Karnan... look at Grandpa!

2082
02:23:37,620 --> 02:23:39,620
Look what they've done to him.

2083
02:23:40,020 --> 02:23:40,850
Go on.

2084
02:23:42,690 --> 02:23:44,560
Oh, Karnan...
look at this.

2085
02:23:45,060 --> 02:23:46,890
They are beating us all up.

2086
02:23:55,900 --> 02:23:56,940
Karnan!

2087
02:24:19,560 --> 02:24:21,060
Karnan!

2088
02:24:40,150 --> 02:24:42,020
Kill him!

2089
02:24:42,620 --> 02:24:44,020
Don't spare him!

2090
02:24:57,100 --> 02:24:59,530
Don't spare him.
Slit his throat!

2091
02:24:59,770 --> 02:25:01,570
Don't spare him, Karnan.

2092
02:25:01,770 --> 02:25:03,270
-Hey...
-Shut your mouth!

2093
02:25:06,140 --> 02:25:08,480
Another blow on my people,
and I will slit your throat.

2094
02:25:08,740 --> 02:25:09,740
Tell them!

2095
02:25:09,810 --> 02:25:10,940
Hey!

2096
02:25:11,140 --> 02:25:12,080
Stop!

2097
02:25:12,150 --> 02:25:13,980
Stop, stop!

2098
02:25:14,110 --> 02:25:15,180
Stop!

2099
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:17,920
Don't let him get away, Karnan.

2100
02:25:17,990 --> 02:25:19,450
Slit his throat.

2101
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:21,390
Don't let him go, Karnan.

2102
02:25:22,960 --> 02:25:28,560
Within an hour, your collector, MLA, MP
must all come down here.

2103
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:31,770
Or only his headless body
will leave this place.

2104
02:25:32,030 --> 02:25:32,900
-Hey.
Hey.

2105
02:25:33,230 --> 02:25:34,400
Walk inside.

2106
02:25:45,780 --> 02:25:46,610
What are you doing?

2107
02:25:47,450 --> 02:25:48,280
Open the door.

2108
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:50,120
Open the door!

2109
02:25:50,620 --> 02:25:53,690
If you'd just come to cry
and done nothing...

2110
02:25:54,320 --> 02:25:55,820
the death toll would have
stopped at one.

2111
02:25:57,020 --> 02:25:58,660
You put a knife to my neck.

2112
02:25:59,390 --> 02:26:02,760
Now you'll witness your village
razed to the ground because of you.

2113
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:04,430
Go, open the door.

2114
02:26:05,570 --> 02:26:06,400
Open the door!

2115
02:26:08,700 --> 02:26:11,540
You ignore my command and
stand there with your chest puffed?

2116
02:26:11,610 --> 02:26:12,570
Die!

2117
02:27:43,030 --> 02:27:43,860
What's your name?

2118
02:27:46,030 --> 02:27:46,870
What's your name?

2119
02:27:48,770 --> 02:27:49,870
Kannapiran.

2120
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:52,140
What's your father's name?

2121
02:27:53,770 --> 02:27:54,780
Tell me or I'll plunge this into you.

2122
02:27:56,480 --> 02:27:57,410
Kandaiah.

2123
02:27:57,810 --> 02:27:58,680
Kandaiah...

2124
02:28:00,980 --> 02:28:03,250
When Kandaiah's son
can be named Kannapiran,

2125
02:28:03,520 --> 02:28:05,490
why can't Maadasamy's son
be named Karnan?

2126
02:28:05,820 --> 02:28:08,520
Why not? Why not? Why not?

2127
02:28:08,660 --> 02:28:10,390
Why not? Why not?

2128
02:28:20,770 --> 02:28:22,770
My needs don't matter to you.

2129
02:28:23,400 --> 02:28:24,940
My troubles don't matter to you.

2130
02:28:27,110 --> 02:28:28,640
All that matters to you
is how I stand before you,

2131
02:28:29,310 --> 02:28:31,310
and how I address you.
Is that it?

2132
02:28:33,850 --> 02:28:36,980
Didn't you hit us
just for standing tall?

2133
02:28:38,850 --> 02:28:39,990
Look here, Boy.

2134
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,860
I'm telling you again.

2135
02:28:42,190 --> 02:28:43,790
You can't kill me.

2136
02:28:45,660 --> 02:28:47,060
When they break this door down,

2137
02:28:47,860 --> 02:28:50,360
that is the end of you,
and your village.

2138
02:28:52,070 --> 02:28:53,330
Listen to me.

2139
02:28:54,030 --> 02:28:56,440
Drop that sword, touch my feet
and apologize before everyone.

2140
02:28:56,570 --> 02:28:58,370
That is your only way to survive.

2141
02:28:58,440 --> 02:29:00,610
-Do you understand?
-Don't say that...

2142
02:29:00,770 --> 02:29:03,810
Don't say that! Keep saying that
and I will plunge this into you.

2143
02:29:05,980 --> 02:29:08,320
I don't care if you slit my throat.

2144
02:29:08,650 --> 02:29:10,450
Because of you, your village is going to
be destroyed.

2145
02:29:11,290 --> 02:29:12,690
The end of your village...

2146
02:29:12,950 --> 02:29:14,350
is the end of this story.

2147
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:24,190
10 YEARS LATER

2148
02:30:25,030 --> 02:30:26,130
PODIYANKULAM

2149
02:30:26,190 --> 02:30:29,530
To my dear brother Karnan,
this is your sister Padmini.

2150
02:30:31,270 --> 02:30:33,270
We don't know what it's like
for you out there.

2151
02:30:33,570 --> 02:30:36,440
We do know that you will manage,
no matter how it is.

2152
02:30:37,070 --> 02:30:38,770
We are all fine here.

2153
02:30:39,410 --> 02:30:42,780
My husband takes good care of our parents
and he takes care of me.

2154
02:30:43,580 --> 02:30:45,950
That day, after everything ended...

2155
02:30:46,310 --> 02:30:48,150
some strangers came to our village.

2156
02:30:48,480 --> 02:30:49,780
They spoke to us about
so many things.

2157
02:30:50,180 --> 02:30:52,420
They took us to several places
to demand justice.

2158
02:30:53,150 --> 02:30:54,820
Suddenly, they came and laid roads.

2159
02:30:55,320 --> 02:30:57,320
Now they're even running
a mini-bus to our village.

2160
02:30:57,690 --> 02:30:58,730
As a result...

2161
02:30:58,830 --> 02:31:02,430
all the kids went to school
and college to study as you wanted.

2162
02:31:02,600 --> 02:31:04,600
Some have started working
good jobs too.

2163
02:31:05,230 --> 02:31:07,430
It's almost like our village
has triumphed.

2164
02:31:07,700 --> 02:31:10,370
But then, in these ten years...

2165
02:31:10,600 --> 02:31:12,710
Grandpa Duryodanan,
Brother Vadamalayan,

2166
02:31:12,770 --> 02:31:16,240
and several others injured
at the hands of the police have died...

2167
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:18,750
and left our village mourning,
and without peace.

2168
02:31:18,810 --> 02:31:23,780
Our only ray of hope
is in anticipation of your return.

2169
02:31:26,520 --> 02:31:27,860
When will you come, Karnan?

2170
02:31:28,190 --> 02:31:29,320
Come back soon.

2171
02:31:29,890 --> 02:31:30,890
Because...

2172
02:31:30,990 --> 02:31:34,530
the day you return will be our Pongal,
Deepavali and every festival.

2173
02:31:35,560 --> 02:31:36,560
Come, Karnan.

2174
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:48,080
Karnan, my boy.
You must not cry.

2175
02:31:48,140 --> 02:31:53,310
In ten years, we've lost so many lives,
our people have cried enough.

2176
02:31:53,480 --> 02:31:56,180
Our people must never cry again.

2177
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:58,520
Let us all dance and be merry.

2178
02:31:58,690 --> 02:32:00,290
Come, Karnan. Let us dance.

2179
02:32:00,350 --> 02:32:01,460
Everybody must dance.

2180
02:32:01,520 --> 02:32:03,020
Hit the drums!

2181
02:33:06,490 --> 02:33:08,990
Keep beating the drums.

2182
02:33:28,980 --> 02:33:32,950
Keep dancing.
