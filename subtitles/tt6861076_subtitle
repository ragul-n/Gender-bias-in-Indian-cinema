1
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,125
What?

2
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,374
Sir, I think it's a case of suicide.

3
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,541
But someone might have pushed her as well.

4
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,749
Only post-mortem report can clarify that.

5
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:39,416
But who might have pushed her?

6
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,333
Let's see what sir has to say.

7
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,542
Move aside...

8
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:50,916
Move...

9
00:03:50,917 --> 00:03:52,625
- Morning, sir!
- Sir.

10
00:04:18,917 --> 00:04:21,333
Pass that to me.

11
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:28,750
Good heavens!
She looks like Bipasha Basu!

12
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:32,499
- No, sir. Tanushree Dutta.
- Hmm.

13
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,708
It's all the same… Tanushree Dutta!

14
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,957
Are there CCTV cameras around?

15
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,291
No, sir.

16
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:42,333
- But the promoter said he'll soon clarify.
- Okay.

17
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:45,041
Which floor did she fall from?

18
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:48,125
Top floor, sir.
They own a flat there.

19
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:51,332
Who are 'they'?

20
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,707
Durjoy Mitra, writer.

21
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,167
He's won awards too.

22
00:04:55,208 --> 00:04:57,958
- Is it? Must be on Facebook?
- Of course!

23
00:04:58,208 --> 00:04:59,874
Call Durjoy Mitra.

24
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,750
- Send him upstairs.
- Okay, sir.

25
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:04,125
- Sir... Okay, sir.
- And get the FIR ready.

26
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,916
Sir, should we call the ambulance?

27
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,708
- Yes.
- Okay, sir.

28
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,499
- Hey, call the ambulance.
- Okay, sir.

29
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,374
Ask the constables to mark the area
with chalk.

30
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:16,375
Don't allow anyone here, okay?

31
00:05:48,417 --> 00:05:53,167
Durjoy Mitra and his
girlfriend Tanushree Dutta.

32
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,708
The emperor and the beauty!

33
00:05:57,167 --> 00:06:00,542
Wow! Very close to Kolkata...

34
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:04,583
But far from the madding crowd!

35
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,416
It's 9:30 p.m. on the wristwatch.

36
00:06:08,417 --> 00:06:12,332
What was the girlfriend of a
celebrity author doing here, then?

37
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,708
Looking pretty only to jump
to her death?

38
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:21,208
No, it's fishy…
Very fishy!

39
00:06:21,542 --> 00:06:25,083
Third Eye, wake up!

40
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,792
Pieces of the puzzle are
scattered, Agnibesh.

41
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:32,917
How will you put it together?

42
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,167
Durjoy…

43
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:39,458
Friend or foe?

44
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,167
Sir...

45
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:10,083
- Durjoy Mitra.
- Hmm.

46
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:17,958
Durjoy Mitra. Durjoy Mitra.
Durjoy Mitra.

47
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,458
When did you two come here yesterday?

48
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:34,458
- I was not here.
- Hmm.

49
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,417
I was out of Kolkata.

50
00:07:41,792 --> 00:07:43,708
You may verify.

51
00:07:57,167 --> 00:08:00,583
- I'm getting late.
- Hmm.

52
00:08:03,083 --> 00:08:05,292
- Whose flat is it?
- Mine.

53
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:07,625
- Okay.
- I mean, it's Tanushree's.

54
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:12,292
- I mean ours. Let me explain it to you.
- Explain later.

55
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,207
I'll be asking straight-forward questions
and you'll give me clear replies.

56
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,625
Otherwise, it's going to be
difficult for you.

57
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:21,749
What started the fight, Durjoy?

58
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,851
Tanushree and I were friends from school
and then college.

59
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,957
We loved each other and
planned to get married.

60
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:28,792
- Cigarette? Okay.
- I don't smoke.

61
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:32,874
- Who started it, you or Tanushree?
- Both.

62
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,625
And who put an end to it?

63
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:39,125
Don't be shy.

64
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:42,625
One should never be
ashamed about sluts, Durjoy…

65
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:46,167
Start from the beginning.

66
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:49,792
Come on... start.

67
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,917
- Few months ago…
- Exactly how many?

68
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,500
- Precisely, four months ago.
- Four months.

69
00:08:58,542 --> 00:09:00,624
- I published an advertisement...
- Okay.

70
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,291
- Looking for a Graphics Designer.
- Uh huh.

71
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:05,708
- Needed one at the office.
- Great! Okay.

72
00:09:06,417 --> 00:09:09,874
A lot of girls applied
but I liked one of them.

73
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:12,250
- Her name's Preyashee Sen.
- Preyashee Sen.

74
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:17,417
Good!

75
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:19,792
Pinaki Ghosh.

76
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,417
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:09:20,418 --> 00:09:23,042
CEO of Power Publishers.
And...

78
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,874
- These are good.
- They are very good.

79
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:25,917
She's Geri Hemer

80
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,208
- Hello.
- Hi.

81
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,875
Daffodil Media Group and Publications.

82
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,125
She publishes all my books
in the US and UK.

83
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:40,292
Isn't she good?

84
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:42,458
Yeah, she's such a talent!

85
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:44,101
I mean these are exactly what we need

86
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,083
for our international readers!

87
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,000
Preyashee, how many frames
can you do in a day?

88
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,458
Four.

89
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:54,167
Five, maybe.

90
00:09:56,042 --> 00:09:58,500
We can only give you four months.

91
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,167
Okay.

92
00:10:00,542 --> 00:10:02,167
Yeah, I think the London Book Fair

93
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,374
is coming up in October.

94
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:07,708
So, we need to send these
for printing in September.

95
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:10,375
So, four months is the maximum
we can give you.

96
00:10:10,667 --> 00:10:11,667
Got it?

97
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,083
Yeah.

98
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,083
Do you have her photo
in your mobile?

99
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:22,875
Only one of them.

100
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:25,542
Show me.

101
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:27,832
One of them?
Who's the other one?

102
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,167
Identical twins.

103
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,583
Really? Strange! Show me!

104
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:38,458
Oh, yes…right!

105
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:40,208
See this, Tamal…

106
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:46,541
But sir, we need to identify both.

107
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:48,624
If you see one, you would
recognize the other!

108
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,333
Identical twins! Isn't it?

109
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,167
- May I?
- Yeah.

110
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,750
Good.

111
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,583
This?

112
00:11:12,292 --> 00:11:13,958
Your hero.

113
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,708
- Alright but this collar here…
- Nikita is ready too.

114
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:40,000
Perfect!

115
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,375
I'm a huge fan of yours!

116
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,542
- Read all your…
- "Forever Yours"...

117
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,833
Have you read it?

118
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:56,083
For... For...

119
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,375
Haven't heard about it.

120
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,750
It's been published
almost a month ago.

121
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,208
My fans must've read it
a few times already.

122
00:12:18,042 --> 00:12:19,375
What's your nickname?

123
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:23,125
Huh?

124
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,250
Pihu.

125
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:27,667
Pihu!

126
00:12:29,917 --> 00:12:31,333
Hopefully, you'll read it now.

127
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,417
This...

128
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:38,833
Let me get the door.

129
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:50,292
Durjoy Mitra in person!
I don't believe this!

130
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:56,958
You look really surprised!
I knew it, it's natural!

131
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,500
But you won't even ask me
to get in?

132
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:01,375
You?

133
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:04,458
There… My sister.

134
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,166
Extremely forgetful.

135
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:07,874
She left with the house keys.

136
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:09,624
So, I couldn't get in.
Mom's not home.

137
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:10,999
So I came to check out the office.

138
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,958
Can I just come in?

139
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,333
Who's outside?

140
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:22,750
Oh, my brother. Pilu, come!

141
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,375
Hi!

142
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,458
Oh, hi! You're into music, right?

143
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,375
How did you know?

144
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,458
Intuition…

145
00:13:41,542 --> 00:13:43,250
Since I write…

146
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:47,625
Oh, brilliant!
Of course, I play music.

147
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,542
Then what happened?

148
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,917
- Pilu went away.
- Went away?

149
00:13:57,542 --> 00:13:59,333
But Kuhu didn't leave.

150
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:04,667
She insisted that I hire her.
Forced me…

151
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:07,792
I...

152
00:14:07,793 --> 00:14:10,333
You'll have to take me.
You can't say no.

153
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,708
Twin sister, what do you think?

154
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:17,208
Shall I employ her?

155
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,417
If you need her, you may...

156
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,708
What about research and editing?

157
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,832
I write for a number of magazines...

158
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,499
deliver speeches at seminars…

159
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,832
They need research.

160
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:31,999
Can you assist me on that?

161
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,333
Try me.

162
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,583
Pihu didn't object.

163
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:42,458
But from her expression I gathered
that she didn't like it.

164
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,625
But she didn't stop me.

165
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,458
After all they're sisters.

166
00:14:47,792 --> 00:14:49,375
They started working together.

167
00:14:50,542 --> 00:14:52,833
At that time I was writing a
column for Times of India.

168
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:55,416
Kuhu started researching for it and...

169
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:57,958
Pihu continued designing
my upcoming graphic novel…

170
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:00,833
The cover etc...

171
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:04,541
The work was going smoothly.

172
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:07,750
In fact, their involvement
made the work easier

173
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:10,833
Of course, it should.

174
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,833
My work would have been easier too
if I had a female assistant.

175
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,667
But my bad luck…

176
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:21,500
How did Tanushree appear
between these two sisters?

177
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,083
Have you read all my books?

178
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,875
Like your sis?

179
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,250
Not at all…

180
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,583
But I've read a few.

181
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:34,708
How many?

182
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:41,958
Honestly, only one… “Dear Friend”.

183
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,542
That means you're not my fan exactly.

184
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,667
Do I really need to read all your books
to be your fan?

185
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,916
It's better not to give me
such preconditions.

186
00:15:54,917 --> 00:15:59,042
Because after all I'm not an avid reader
like Pihu.

187
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:04,000
We, writers are in desperate need of fans.

188
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:11,124
And I am in desperate need...

189
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,792
of a fag.

190
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,458
Is smoking allowed?

191
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,625
Here?

192
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,792
I don't smoke but you can.

193
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,375
Tanushree!

194
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,500
And you're Preyashee, right?

195
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,500
Yes. You can call me Pihu.

196
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:56,042
In fact, I already know you.

197
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,375
Durjoy spoke to me about you.

198
00:16:58,583 --> 00:17:01,292
How's work? Huh!

199
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:11,875
Kuhu.

200
00:17:13,542 --> 00:17:15,625
This is insane!

201
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:18,500
How do people differentiate
between the two of you?

202
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:24,833
- I generally tie my hair this way… And this.
- Huh?

203
00:17:28,667 --> 00:17:32,458
Please keep wearing that!
I was shocked.

204
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,958
Durjoy, we're already late.
We should leave.

205
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:40,333
Yeah, sure…
Let's do one thing…

206
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:41,458
Hmm?

207
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:43,458
Let's take them along.

208
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:44,875
Would you like to join us?

209
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:45,875
Yes!

210
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,167
No!

211
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,542
Pihu and Kuhu are so different.

212
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:54,833
Their behaviours are completely different.

213
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:56,875
Pihu is calm.

214
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,125
And Kuhu…

215
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:04,708
Kuhu's a lot like Tanushree…

216
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:09,917
They shared the same interest…shopping.

217
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:14,125
Their favourite thing in the world!

218
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,458
Tanushree was not like this before…

219
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,042
She had varied interests in the past.

220
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:25,708
We've even recited Keats
together, drenched in rain!

221
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,833
This is exactly what happens!

222
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:38,208
Once the women trap us with their charms,
they suddenly change colours.

223
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:43,500
But it didn't happen with you…

224
00:18:44,375 --> 00:18:45,875
She couldn't trap you…

225
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,457
You fell in love with another woman!

226
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:50,207
Whom did you like more
between the two wenches?

227
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,208
Mind your language!

228
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,332
Be a sport!

229
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:56,082
Women were called wenches
in the olden days!

230
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:57,707
These are not olden days!

231
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,292
Alright! Carry on…

232
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,667
Who did you like more?

233
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:03,832
Your favourite film…

234
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:06,375
What kind of films
do you watch, Tanushree?

235
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,542
Bollywood…

236
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,333
Salman Khan!

237
00:19:11,042 --> 00:19:12,875
I never skip any of his films.

238
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,708
And I can rarely make time for films.

239
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,000
But I hope that Salman will make a movie
based on my novel someday!

240
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,333
Guys, excuse me.
I'll be back from the restroom.

241
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,708
Yeah, sure.

242
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,000
Kuhu... Umm...

243
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,625
Kuhu… please, please, please...
Not here, please.

244
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,458
Please...

245
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,000
Umm.

246
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,125
- Can I order another beer for you?
- Uh huh.

247
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,417
I want to eat you up.

248
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,833
- What?
- I want to eat you up!

249
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,708
I think I missed something?

250
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:46,958
- No.
- Not yet. But you will.

251
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:48,167
Huh?

252
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:59,792
Kuhu misbehaved a lot that day.

253
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,125
But I couldn't stay mad at her
for ltoo ong.

254
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,417
Actually, the fact that...

255
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,500
the two sisters are poles apart

256
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:12,708
made both of them
very interesting to me.

257
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,583
Both?

258
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,417
Where's Kuhu?

259
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:30,999
She can't come today.

260
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,042
Why?

261
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:36,500
She's not well... that's why...

262
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,875
She's supposed to write
an important speech.

263
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,417
Can I write it?

264
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,667
Okay.

265
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,458
You can try if you want...

266
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:55,457
No, no…no 'if'…I can

267
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,208
Write... The subject is written there.

268
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:02,167
On the first page of the pad.
It's kept right there.

269
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:13,708
I liked them both
because they were good at their work.

270
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:19,582
Kuhu wrote several speeches
for me

271
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:23,167
And I got applauded in various conferences
for those.

272
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:25,708
And Pihu is a real gem.

273
00:22:26,875 --> 00:22:29,625
She finished designing my graphic novel
very quickly.

274
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,708
Four months went by
in the blink of an eye…

275
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:36,042
But yesterday in the afternoon...

276
00:22:48,375 --> 00:22:49,500
Good.

277
00:22:51,625 --> 00:22:52,958
Nice.

278
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:56,708
The writing is intense.

279
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:59,167
You write quite well!

280
00:23:00,792 --> 00:23:03,125
I can do everything for you.

281
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,625
What do you mean?

282
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,624
What? What?

283
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:22,000
What I mean to say is that…

284
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:28,417
Durjoy, I'm the fittest for you.

285
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:33,957
What... what are you doing?

286
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:38,291
- I've been trying to make you understand...
- Pihu... Pihu...

287
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:43,458
- Pihu!
- That I'm the fittest for you!

288
00:23:44,042 --> 00:23:49,542
But I can't make you understand…
in any way…

289
00:24:58,833 --> 00:25:01,708
So, Durjoy…
this happened yesterday afternoon.

290
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,332
And by evening you disposed off
your old stock!

291
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,833
What do you mean?

292
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:08,708
What are you trying to say?

293
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,375
What are you implying?

294
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:13,042
- That I pushed Tanushree...
- Yes... you pushed her.

295
00:25:13,625 --> 00:25:15,167
That's exactly what I mean.

296
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,999
You said you weren't here yesterday.

297
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,499
Who did Tanushree come here with?
Do you know?

298
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,541
- How would I know?
- You don't know!

299
00:25:21,542 --> 00:25:24,957
- She might have come alone.
- Of course.

300
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,249
She could've come here alone.

301
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,166
And jumped out of the window
by herself.

302
00:25:29,167 --> 00:25:30,874
- Am I right?
- Bloody...

303
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:32,874
Hey, mind your language.

304
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,999
Mind your language, Durjoy.

305
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,542
Sir, please excuse me for a moment…

306
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,624
- Sir, I was conducting a routine enquiry...
- Hmm.

307
00:25:41,625 --> 00:25:43,582
- The labourer who had discovered the body...
- Hmm.

308
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,917
He had taken this purse
with him home.

309
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,667
Oh no.

310
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:50,000
- This has been tampered with.
- Yes, sir.

311
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:52,833
He intended to steal it.

312
00:25:53,125 --> 00:25:55,250
The moment I asked him
his name...

313
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:58,458
He started crying
and handed me the purse.

314
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,458
Do you recognise this purse?

315
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,916
Tanushree has several purses like that.

316
00:26:02,917 --> 00:26:03,917
Oh!

317
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:07,625
Say she had…say 'had'… Past.

318
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:14,666
- Sir, there's a mobile phone inside.
- Is it so?

319
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:15,583
Hmm.

320
00:26:15,584 --> 00:26:17,332
Let's see the phone.

321
00:26:17,333 --> 00:26:19,166
Let me check the screensaver.

322
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:20,957
But the screen is locked.

323
00:26:20,958 --> 00:26:22,500
That's disappointing!

324
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:26,957
There are a lot of bank cards.
And make-up as well.

325
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:27,583
Sir.

326
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:29,332
- Durjoy.
- Let's go meet the labourer.

327
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:30,624
- Durjoy...
- Yes, sir!

328
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:32,457
Do you know the password
to unlock the phone?

329
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,541
What if he starts crying again?

330
00:26:33,542 --> 00:26:34,542
Huh?

331
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,500
Do the Sen sisters know
about this accident?

332
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:51,708
After getting the news from Inspector
Tamal, I called them up this morning.

333
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,289
I told them that I'm going to Delhi
for a conference.

334
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:57,291
I asked them not to come to office
until further notice.

335
00:26:57,292 --> 00:26:59,208
And it'd be a paid leave for them.

336
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:07,292
Durjoy, send the sisters' address to Tamal
on WhatsApp.

337
00:27:10,042 --> 00:27:11,624
Pihu…

338
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:15,582
Kuhu left without closing the door.

339
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,416
Please shut the door, dear.

340
00:27:17,417 --> 00:27:18,417
Yes, sure.

341
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,458
- Oh my God!
- What happened?

342
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,292
- Who are you?
- Who's it?

343
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,330
- Who is it?
- Senior Inspector, North Circle, ma'am.

344
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:46,833
Here you go.

345
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:48,833
Agnibesh Chatterjee.

346
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,542
Hello, ma'am!

347
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,749
I'm here about a case.

348
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,207
Last night at 9 p.m.
there was an accident.

349
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,374
I need to know if that was a murder
or a suicide…

350
00:27:58,375 --> 00:28:02,292
Ma'am, can I have some
cold water please?

351
00:28:03,792 --> 00:28:04,958
Cold water?

352
00:28:06,042 --> 00:28:07,122
Please give him some water.

353
00:28:08,208 --> 00:28:10,649
- Why are you here?
- The the victim's name is Tanushree Dutta

354
00:28:10,917 --> 00:28:12,625
Please take a seat.

355
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,500
Let's have a chat.

356
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:18,625
Please be seated, ma'am

357
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:19,875
What?

358
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,625
You are Preyashee Sen, right?

359
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:26,184
Or are you Kuhu without the
hairstyle and the glasses?

360
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,833
You two are so confusing!

361
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,833
- Water.
- Thank you, ma'am.

362
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,000
Thanks a lot.

363
00:28:35,001 --> 00:28:37,000
Ma'am, you can get back
to your work.

364
00:28:37,208 --> 00:28:39,500
I'll just ask a few routine questions.

365
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:41,500
Okay, ma'am.

366
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:46,500
- I...
- Yes...

367
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,458
I… I'm Preyashee, Pihu…

368
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,000
Who's playing the guitar, ma'am?
It's really good.

369
00:28:51,292 --> 00:28:53,250
My brother, Pilu…

370
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,167
Palash Sen.

371
00:28:56,208 --> 00:28:58,832
He's been arrested
a few times for petty cases.

372
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:00,708
There are cases against
him at a few stations.

373
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,417
Is he still a drug addict?

374
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:08,291
For the last 47 days,
he's been absolutely clean.

375
00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:10,541
And he's back to music.
Can you hear him?

376
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:12,542
Hmm... playing very good.

377
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:18,332
Please tell me the news about
Tanushree was a joke.

378
00:29:18,333 --> 00:29:19,375
Absolutely not.

379
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,041
Ma'am, where were you
tomorrow afternoon?

380
00:29:22,042 --> 00:29:23,000
At home.

381
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:26,458
Ma'am, you were with Durjoy Mitra
yesterday afternoon.

382
00:29:26,792 --> 00:29:29,125
And when you two were kissing, then…

383
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:31,124
- When you were kissing…
- What?

384
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:33,207
Tanushree Dutta saw the two of you...

385
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:37,458
And she got upset, naturally,
and committed suicide.

386
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,417
Now at this point...

387
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,832
I can arrest both of you
for abetting Tanushree to commit suicide.

388
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:44,042
What do you think?

389
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,749
I told you I was at home.

390
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,832
Listen, listen…You're saying
that Durjoy Mitra is lying.

391
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,582
And since the liar is usually the culprit.

392
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:54,999
I need to arrest Durjoy Mitra.

393
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,917
- He's the murderer.
- No.

394
00:29:55,917 --> 00:29:56,917
I'll arrest him.

395
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,833
No…no…
Listen to me…

396
00:29:59,333 --> 00:30:02,041
Durjoy Mitra can never
do something like this.

397
00:30:02,042 --> 00:30:03,374
Take my word for it.

398
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:05,375
Where's Kuhelika right now, ma'am?

399
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:09,249
When Kuhu came to know
she doesn't have to go to office today

400
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,166
she went out shopping with Lisa.

401
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:12,208
Who's Lisa?

402
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:17,124
- I mentioned my brother Pilu.
- Pilu.

403
00:30:17,125 --> 00:30:18,625
She is Pilu's girlfriend…

404
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:21,875
We're all friends since childhood.

405
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:26,208
- But Lisa is engaged to Pilu. They're in love.
- I see.

406
00:30:26,292 --> 00:30:30,082
Between Pihu and Kuhu,
Durjoy saw Pihu that day.

407
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,542
Did he just see her, sir?

408
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:35,833
He tasted her.

409
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:38,374
Whatever! The thing is...

410
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:41,166
Preyashee claims she didn't go to office
that day.

411
00:30:41,167 --> 00:30:42,917
But Tanushree saw Preyashee.

412
00:30:43,417 --> 00:30:44,958
Preyashee must be lying.

413
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,542
- Sir.
- Hmm?

414
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:55,833
Is there any reason to believe
that Durjoy is telling us the truth?

415
00:30:56,792 --> 00:30:57,792
Correct!

416
00:30:57,833 --> 00:30:58,994
There's absolutely no reason.

417
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:02,667
Let's move from the viewer's place…

418
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:05,082
None of them are professional criminals.

419
00:31:05,083 --> 00:31:06,832
They're bound to make a mistake.

420
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:09,000
And we'll wait for it.

421
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,292
Pihu.

422
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,042
Try to complete five frames in a day.

423
00:31:29,208 --> 00:31:32,292
I knew that
since the day of the interview, Durjoy.

424
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:38,500
But you're doing four…

425
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:41,167
The deadline is almost here…

426
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:45,833
Yes but Durjoy, we need to think
about the quality as well.

427
00:31:47,042 --> 00:31:48,042
Hmm.

428
00:31:48,417 --> 00:31:49,500
Yes, obviously.

429
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,792
I have total faith in you.

430
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,167
I know you can do it.

431
00:31:55,792 --> 00:31:58,375
And without compromising either
on quality or quantity.

432
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:02,375
Actually, you know...

433
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,125
You're a genius!

434
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Fast!

435
00:32:33,042 --> 00:32:34,208
I've some news.

436
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,458
Our graphic novel...

437
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,625
is selling like hot cakes!

438
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,249
It's caused a sensation in London!

439
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:49,500
Daffodil wants to publish my next novel,
'Forever Yours' as a graphic novel too!

440
00:32:52,958 --> 00:32:54,583
Will I be working on that one as well?

441
00:33:02,542 --> 00:33:03,750
Of course, you will.

442
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:08,792
Who else but you?

443
00:33:15,917 --> 00:33:16,875
- Damn!
- Pilu, you can do it!

444
00:33:16,876 --> 00:33:18,957
Pilu, Pilu, Pilu!

445
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:22,416
Give me a cigarette…
give me a cigarette…

446
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,541
- It's in Kuhu's bag.
- No, no, she isn't home.

447
00:33:25,542 --> 00:33:27,292
- Please get it.
- She is not home!

448
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:28,999
Bring me a cigarette from anywhere…

449
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Shut up!

450
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,875
I'm telling you Kuhu's not home!

451
00:33:33,542 --> 00:33:37,292
- Nothing happened to you…nothing's wrong.
- Everything is okay.

452
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,542
- Pilu, dear, you can… I know you can...
- I can't...

453
00:33:41,208 --> 00:33:43,291
- Give me one joint.
- You can do it, Pilu.

454
00:33:43,292 --> 00:33:45,082
- Just one joint...
- No, no, no...

455
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,207
- Please just one...
- No, she won't!

456
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:49,416
- Just one drag.
- Not now. Calm down.

457
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:52,583
(indistinct chatter)

458
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:01,042
Lisa.

459
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:03,417
Why was Pilu shouting so loudly?

460
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,208
It gave me a headache!

461
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,875
Don't talk like that!

462
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,875
He's trying his best.

463
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:13,082
He was having spasms…
he was suffering.

464
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:15,875
He'll never quit!
He'll never give up…

465
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:18,542
It's better you get over the addiction.

466
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:20,542
And get over Pilu too.

467
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:21,917
Let it be.

468
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,832
I've something to tell you.

469
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,750
What do you want to tell me?

470
00:34:31,833 --> 00:34:33,917
Durjoy wants to marry Pihu.

471
00:34:48,958 --> 00:34:50,417
Did Pihu tell you?

472
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,125
Hmm.

473
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:54,000
Yes, a few minutes back.

474
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:05,333
Listen, Lisa.

475
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,792
No one should know the truth, ever.

476
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,333
Not now, not never, not ever!

477
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:20,417
- No one will know.
- You better remember that!

478
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,625
Are you getting married to Durjoy?

479
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:50,042
Did Lisa tell you?

480
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,958
Hmm. Did you agree?

481
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,500
I don't know. I mean…

482
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:05,375
Actually, after Tanushree's death...

483
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:08,082
Durjoy's become very lonely.

484
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:10,708
His family doesn't stay with him.

485
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:25,708
Durjoy loves you…

486
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,875
You obviously love him…

487
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:32,917
Then...

488
00:36:33,083 --> 00:36:35,125
Then what will happen to me, Pihu?

489
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,750
Have you ever given it a thought?

490
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,917
I also crave for him.

491
00:36:45,458 --> 00:36:49,250
What I'm trying to tell you
is that, Pihu...

492
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:55,083
You don't need to worry
about me because…

493
00:36:55,917 --> 00:36:58,417
We're identical twins.

494
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,417
Everything matches...
face, body…

495
00:37:03,625 --> 00:37:06,792
Even our body odours match.

496
00:37:09,208 --> 00:37:11,292
Durjoy won't be able to differentiate.

497
00:37:11,833 --> 00:37:17,292
Whatever little difference is there,
I'll manage.

498
00:37:17,333 --> 00:37:19,749
Are you getting what I'm saying?

499
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,375
Wait, let me explain.

500
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:32,042
You can intellectually satisfy Durjoy 100%,
I know that.

501
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,708
But not in bed.

502
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:37,917
I can do that, Pihu.

503
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:40,292
And you know it.

504
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:44,250
Ma'am, yesterday afternoon
you were with Durjoy Mitra.

505
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:47,208
And when you two were
kissing each other, then…

506
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:52,542
Don't think about that incident please…

507
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,166
That'll never happen again, Pihu,

508
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:59,208
It's a promise from my side.
It'll never happen again.

509
00:37:59,833 --> 00:38:01,875
He'll never get bored with you.

510
00:38:01,917 --> 00:38:03,625
He'll never look at any other girl.

511
00:38:03,708 --> 00:38:10,042
And… and we three will be in Paradise
for the rest of our lives!

512
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:12,125
Wow!

513
00:38:32,083 --> 00:38:34,083
What kind of place is Paradise?

514
00:38:39,167 --> 00:38:41,917
You're saying something
about it…

515
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:47,625
You, I and Durjoy...

516
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:50,750
Paradise.

517
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:56,417
It's a beautiful place.

518
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:02,042
You want to go?

519
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,833
You want to?

520
00:39:06,417 --> 00:39:07,777
Then what will happen to me, Pihu?

521
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:12,625
Hmm… but before that I was thinking
of throwing a bachelorette party.

522
00:39:13,458 --> 00:39:14,625
Yes!

523
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:20,458
Long drive, beer, fun!

524
00:39:21,083 --> 00:39:23,708
And… cheers!

525
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:30,625
You're flying.

526
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,250
Don't worry, nothing will happen.

527
00:39:34,292 --> 00:39:38,292
Okay but you don't need to drive so fast.

528
00:39:41,917 --> 00:39:44,917
Please, you know I can't take high speed.

529
00:39:49,917 --> 00:39:51,583
Please slow down.

530
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:57,958
Why are you driving so fast?

531
00:40:00,208 --> 00:40:02,500
Please, don't drive so fast.

532
00:40:04,875 --> 00:40:06,625
Slow down, slow down, slow...

533
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:10,792
Please slow down,
please, please, please...

534
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:14,625
Please...

535
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,458
Please...

536
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:22,750
Please, I'm scared,
I'm really scared, please!

537
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,500
(song playing)

538
00:40:39,583 --> 00:40:40,791
Sir, the car was running
at a speed of 110km/hr.

539
00:40:40,792 --> 00:40:41,375
Hmm.

540
00:40:41,376 --> 00:40:42,542
Both injured...

541
00:40:42,667 --> 00:40:44,666
But Pihu was released after first aid.

542
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:45,667
And Kuhu?

543
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,500
Kuhu is still in the hospital.

544
00:40:47,917 --> 00:40:50,957
But something caught my eyes…

545
00:40:50,958 --> 00:40:51,500
What?

546
00:40:51,501 --> 00:40:56,166
Their brother Pilu and his girlfriend…

547
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,499
- Lisa.
- Yes, Lisa.

548
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,000
They are the only two visitors
at the hospital.

549
00:41:03,833 --> 00:41:04,833
And what about Pihu?

550
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:19,000
I still can't believe it...

551
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:23,125
I feel so helpless.

552
00:41:24,167 --> 00:41:25,500
Don't be so worried.

553
00:41:26,083 --> 00:41:27,792
It's just an accident.

554
00:41:28,208 --> 00:41:30,125
It could've happened to anyone.

555
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:33,167
- There's nothing to worry about.
- Right!

556
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:35,457
You still have so much
to offer as an artist.

557
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,542
Stop worrying about all this.

558
00:41:38,292 --> 00:41:40,458
Everything will be alright.
Don't worry.

559
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:46,083
I think it's Pilu back from the hospital.

560
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:50,167
Come in.

561
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:52,166
- Is Durjoy here?
- What happened?

562
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:53,292
- Hi.
- Hi.

563
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:55,250
What news do you have?

564
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:57,917
How is Kuhu?

565
00:41:59,792 --> 00:42:00,792
Huh?

566
00:42:02,083 --> 00:42:03,750
She is safe this time.

567
00:42:03,917 --> 00:42:04,917
Great!

568
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:09,667
Now stop crying.

569
00:42:09,833 --> 00:42:12,958
- So, she's out of danger?
- Yes, she is okay.

570
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:15,000
She's totally out of coma I think.

571
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,583
Is she talking?

572
00:42:17,917 --> 00:42:20,250
She's not talking yet.
Not too much movement yet.

573
00:42:20,542 --> 00:42:21,500
Drink some water.
You're panting.

574
00:42:21,501 --> 00:42:26,292
Everyone of them said
Kuhu has a very strong heart.

575
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:27,625
Okay.

576
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:30,833
Maybe, just for that,
it won't take her too long.

577
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:31,583
Oh.

578
00:42:31,708 --> 00:42:33,250
- She'll recover soon.
- That's great!

579
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,958
Are you smoking?

580
00:42:35,917 --> 00:42:37,000
Are you smoking?

581
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:44,917
Last night, she was staring at the moon
from the balcony and smoking.

582
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:46,750
But you don't smoke.

583
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,208
I'm feeling so stressed...

584
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,958
What do mean?
You'll smoke because you're stressed?

585
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,708
I've asked Kuhu so many times
not to smoke.

586
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:58,458
She never listened to me.

587
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,207
Now you've started too.

588
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,000
Just look at this.

589
00:43:03,958 --> 00:43:05,542
Just assume I am Kuhu.

590
00:43:08,833 --> 00:43:10,292
- Tamal?
- Yes, sir.

591
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,542
What are you doing? Huh?

592
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,625
It's been 12 days since the accident.
It all looks helpless now.

593
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:19,833
The Tanushree case...
Was it murder or suicide?

594
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:21,750
Say something.

595
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,749
- How strange!
- What can I say, sir?

596
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,625
I'm keeping an eye, sir.

597
00:43:25,917 --> 00:43:28,197
- Are you keeping an eye?
- Kuhu is still in the hospital.

598
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:31,333
Soemtimes her mother, sometimes her brother
and sometimes Lisa...

599
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:32,375
are going to visit her.

600
00:43:32,417 --> 00:43:33,541
But the doctor is not allowing her.

601
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:34,625
Since she is in the ICU.

602
00:43:34,708 --> 00:43:36,208
And is Durjoy going to visit her?

603
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:38,125
He went once I think.

604
00:43:38,375 --> 00:43:39,535
Yes, he went to see her once.

605
00:43:40,375 --> 00:43:42,458
One copy is bed ridden, got it?

606
00:43:43,375 --> 00:43:45,333
Keep an eye on the other one.

607
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:47,917
And keep a watch on Durjoy.

608
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:49,958
My intuition tells me...

609
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:53,000
we're going to receive some good news soon.

610
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,667
Good news?

611
00:43:57,042 --> 00:43:58,042
Or bad news.

612
00:44:02,167 --> 00:44:03,250
Now you sign.

613
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,250
Right here.

614
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,208
Congratulations!

615
00:44:09,292 --> 00:44:09,583
Yeah!

616
00:44:09,584 --> 00:44:11,625
You're officially husband
and wife from today!

617
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:14,208
(indistinct chatter)

618
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,125
(song playing)

619
00:47:26,083 --> 00:47:27,250
I think I'm lucky...

620
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,625
that you're in my life.

621
00:47:32,458 --> 00:47:33,833
Aren't you going to office?

622
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,042
Hmm...

623
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,250
Of course, I will.

624
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,250
You're also coming?

625
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:40,000
You are not?

626
00:47:40,875 --> 00:47:44,958
The design work on "Forever Yours"
is starting today.

627
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,750
Do you know what I want?

628
00:47:49,125 --> 00:47:50,500
The heroine's face...

629
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:52,458
Especially her eyes...

630
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:53,792
should be like yours.

631
00:47:53,793 --> 00:47:55,583
So, design it like that.

632
00:47:59,417 --> 00:48:02,833
I'm not going to paint anymore.

633
00:48:04,833 --> 00:48:05,542
Are you kidding?

634
00:48:05,543 --> 00:48:06,708
- Huh?
- Hmm.

635
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,208
- Seriously...
- What?

636
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:13,458
- I'm telling ypu seriously...
- What? What? Seriously what?

637
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,815
- I'm telling you.
- I don't get you.

638
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,792
- I'm telling you.
- Huh?

639
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:19,250
I'm telling you.

640
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:20,917
For every successful man...

641
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:23,667
there has to be a...

642
00:48:24,625 --> 00:48:26,250
perfect homemaker.

643
00:48:28,417 --> 00:48:30,250
And therefore...

644
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:33,000
from now on I will be...

645
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:38,917
I'll just concentrate on my hubby
and my family.

646
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:41,083
- Yes...
- Okay but...

647
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:42,958
You'll seriously never paint again?

648
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:44,500
Ever?

649
00:48:44,833 --> 00:48:48,917
You should place another ad.

650
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:53,042
You should look
for another graphic novel artiste.

651
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,708
Okay.

652
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:00,167
Okay.

653
00:49:05,875 --> 00:49:06,625
Hello.

654
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:09,250
Hey, listen up!
Kuhu is trying to talk.

655
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:11,250
Listen to me.

656
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:14,332
We're bringing her home.
I've spoken to Mom.

657
00:49:14,333 --> 00:49:15,458
It's all done.

658
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:16,958
Okay.

659
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,365
Yeah, will you be able to come?

660
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,083
Then come over.

661
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:22,957
And let Durjoy...

662
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:23,958
know, okay?

663
00:49:24,167 --> 00:49:25,167
And you get here soon.

664
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,125
Okay. I'll be there.

665
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,000
That was Pilu on the phone.

666
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:35,208
Huh?

667
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:36,875
Hmm.

668
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,417
- What did he say?
- Kuhu...

669
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:40,208
Kuhu...

670
00:49:40,917 --> 00:49:42,667
Kuhu is moving her lips.

671
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
She is trying to talk.

672
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,000
Great! Great!
Great news!

673
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,167
She is not completely okay...

674
00:49:49,583 --> 00:49:51,351
- She is trying a bit...
- She'll be able to in some time.

675
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:53,541
- Slowly, she's trying...
- Great.

676
00:49:53,542 --> 00:49:55,958
So, Pilu is bringing her home.

677
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:57,292
Really?

678
00:49:57,583 --> 00:49:59,000
Wow! Wow!

679
00:49:59,292 --> 00:50:01,583
Mom won't be able to take care
of her alone. So...

680
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,625
I have to...

681
00:50:04,333 --> 00:50:06,667
go... I'll go.

682
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:11,750
It's okay if you don't want to go.

683
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:15,250
You've got lots of work to do.

684
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,166
You have to go to office.

685
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:21,207
You have to post an ad
for a new graphic artist.

686
00:50:21,208 --> 00:50:22,791
You have to find someone.

687
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:25,250
So, lots of work.

688
00:50:25,542 --> 00:50:27,250
So, ummm...

689
00:50:27,542 --> 00:50:29,375
It's fine if you show up
in the evening. Okay?

690
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:31,250
I'll go now.

691
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:34,708
Bye.

692
00:50:48,667 --> 00:50:51,125
Sir, Kuhu is being discharged
from the hospital today.

693
00:50:51,458 --> 00:50:53,418
I've put my team's most efficent officers
on this.

694
00:50:54,917 --> 00:51:00,375
Are you sure the girl in the hospital
is actually Kuhu?

695
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,292
She's recovered a lot.

696
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:38,424
Nothing to worry about.
She'll get better soon.

697
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:40,746
Kuhu has always been strong.

698
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:41,167
Hmm.

699
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:42,833
It has become her habit.

700
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,792
Just imagine.

701
00:51:45,042 --> 00:51:46,292
She was bed ridden...

702
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:49,500
She fought with death
and now she's back.

703
00:51:50,708 --> 00:51:52,042
I am sorry...

704
00:51:52,792 --> 00:51:53,792
It's okay.

705
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:57,625
I have some good news.

706
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:04,500
NUS?

707
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:07,083
National University of Singapore.

708
00:52:09,042 --> 00:52:09,750
What does it mean?

709
00:52:09,917 --> 00:52:11,167
What's it for?
Which course?

710
00:52:11,792 --> 00:52:14,333
A short course on mass communication
for six months.

711
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:16,789
They're offering scholarship to those
who score well.

712
00:52:17,583 --> 00:52:18,583
Are you going?

713
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:20,125
Shouldn't I go?

714
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:23,000
No... Only if you are serious.

715
00:52:24,625 --> 00:52:25,542
How can I not go?

716
00:52:25,583 --> 00:52:27,583
I don't even know
when you applied for it.

717
00:52:27,833 --> 00:52:28,833
In January.

718
00:52:29,333 --> 00:52:31,583
I applied through an online test.

719
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:32,832
So, I scored well.

720
00:52:32,833 --> 00:52:34,125
They gave me a scholarship.

721
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,500
Okay.

722
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:40,292
- And I've decided to go.
- To go...

723
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:42,458
- Good.
- Okay.

724
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,833
So, what you were saying
in the morning...

725
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,542
Today your sister was telling me...

726
00:52:48,417 --> 00:52:50,624
She won't paint anymore.
She'd give up painting forever.

727
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:54,417
Because she wanted to give me
undivided attention.

728
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:56,917
What was that about?

729
00:52:58,625 --> 00:52:59,750
That was a twist.

730
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,542
You should have seen your face.

731
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,125
Anyway...

732
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,957
I've already got my flight tickets.

733
00:53:09,958 --> 00:53:11,875
It's three o'clock in the morning today.

734
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:16,792
The space is all yours.
I'll be right back.

735
00:53:22,958 --> 00:53:25,333
I'm doing it for the both of us.

736
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:28,458
I really think that...

737
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:32,833
we really need this and...

738
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,833
I want to do better.

739
00:53:34,875 --> 00:53:36,250
One moment... One moment...

740
00:53:36,583 --> 00:53:38,000
I'll get some water.

741
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,833
I'm not stopping you.

742
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,541
And tehre's no reason to stop you.

743
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:47,125
I'm just...

744
00:53:48,333 --> 00:53:50,000
I'm just trying to say that...

745
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,166
I'm not prepared.
I'm not ready.

746
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:54,167
You can't just suddenly take off...

747
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:56,042
I'll come back soon.

748
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:59,000
Besides that... Listen...

749
00:53:59,792 --> 00:54:03,333
In a few days, you are going to join me
in Singapore. Aren't you?

750
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
No...

751
00:54:05,917 --> 00:54:06,917
Ummm.

752
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,083
I'm not free after a month because...

753
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,416
I have to finish the work
on "Forever Yours".

754
00:54:12,417 --> 00:54:15,333
Then I have attend a few conferences...

755
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:18,292
It'll at least take a month.

756
00:54:20,458 --> 00:54:22,417
You know Pihu can handle all that.

757
00:54:22,875 --> 00:54:24,833
Yeah. I know.

758
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:32,875
Just a matter of a few days.
Then, it'll just be you and me.

759
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,750
No intruders!

760
00:54:38,583 --> 00:54:39,958
Intruders?

761
00:54:41,208 --> 00:54:42,458
What do you mean?

762
00:54:44,458 --> 00:54:45,458
Nothing.

763
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:48,667
- You just mentionaed intruders.
- No, just like that.

764
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,625
Okay. Okay.

765
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:56,542
I'll have to go now.

766
00:54:56,917 --> 00:54:59,999
I'll say goodbye to your mom.

767
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,875
Mom already had her sleeping pills.

768
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,749
I'll check in on Kuhu.

769
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:09,832
Did you say your flight was at 3 a.m.?

770
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:11,625
You are family.

771
00:55:12,292 --> 00:55:14,792
Yeah, of course, I am.

772
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,458
Goodbye.

773
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:17,792
Hmmm.

774
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,583
Bye. Bye.

775
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:24,292
I have to leave early tomorrow.

776
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,500
Have a safe trip.

777
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:49,500
- Sir, may I come in?
- Yes, come in.

778
00:55:51,958 --> 00:55:53,000
- Sir.
- Hmm?

779
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,208
A body was discovered.

780
00:55:57,583 --> 00:56:00,667
You sounded like you've found
Tagore's lost Nobel Prize.

781
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:03,875
No, I mean... The thing is...

782
00:56:04,375 --> 00:56:05,375
Wait, sir.

783
00:56:06,542 --> 00:56:08,375
- What's that?
- Take a look, sir.

784
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:11,208
Today around 5 a.m.

785
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:13,291
Near Chandpurghat.

786
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:15,833
- Let me see.
- This body was found.

787
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:27,542
- Who is that girl?
- Sir, Lisa.

788
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:31,125
Pick her up.
Bring her in.

789
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,292
We need to talk, Durjoy.

790
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:41,042
May I come in?

791
00:56:41,292 --> 00:56:42,292
Please come in.

792
00:56:44,125 --> 00:56:45,291
Can I sit here?

793
00:56:45,292 --> 00:56:47,208
- Please sit wherever you want.
- Thank you.

794
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:48,833
Please take a seat.

795
00:56:54,208 --> 00:56:59,000
I have a doubt
that you've made a huge mistake, Durjoy.

796
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,042
Do you get what I am saying?

797
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:05,917
I've asked Kuhu not to smoke.
But she never listens to me.

798
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,792
Just assume I'm Kuhu.

799
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:09,541
What are you saying?

800
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:13,083
I'm not going to paint anymore.

801
00:57:13,208 --> 00:57:16,500
I've already booked my flight.

802
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,583
It's at 3 a.m.

803
00:57:25,792 --> 00:57:31,167
Where has she gone to study?

804
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:34,832
- NUS in Singapore.
- Singapore.

805
00:57:34,833 --> 00:57:37,667
Can you please call them?

806
00:57:38,583 --> 00:57:41,042
Call them.

807
00:57:45,958 --> 00:57:48,625
- Do you know the ISD code?
- Hmm.

808
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:52,208
- Do you know?
- No.

809
00:57:55,625 --> 00:57:58,874
Hello, NUS?

810
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:02,542
This is Durjoy Mitra. Yeah.
I'm calling from India.

811
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:04,458
I want to know...

812
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:15,333
What?

813
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:23,167
Yeah. Thank you.

814
00:58:29,292 --> 00:58:31,750
What happened?

815
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:39,500
NUS just informed me that there's no one
in the university by that name.

816
00:58:42,417 --> 00:58:45,292
Let me give you a new information.

817
00:58:45,583 --> 00:58:53,042
No Preyashee landed up
in Dumdum either.

818
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:04,917
I'll have to go to Pihu's place right now.

819
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:13,750
- Kuhu...
- Kuhu?

820
00:59:13,875 --> 00:59:21,875
Kuhu or Pihu? Kuhu or Pihu?
Kuhu or Pihu?

821
00:59:26,792 --> 00:59:30,417
- Kuhu or Pihu?
- Kuhu...

822
00:59:32,708 --> 00:59:36,625
Forever yours.

823
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:40,792
Pihu? Pihu?

824
01:00:05,875 --> 01:00:11,375
I asked her to drive slowly
over and over again.

825
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:14,458
You know I don't like speed.

826
01:00:15,542 --> 01:00:18,792
I didn't realise why she was doing it.

827
01:00:19,958 --> 01:00:26,375
Then she suddenly started driving faster...

828
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:28,167
Please!

829
01:01:11,542 --> 01:01:13,708
What should I do now, Durjoy?

830
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:16,667
Both are my children.

831
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,625
Did this sibling rivalry exist
since childhood?

832
01:01:39,417 --> 01:01:41,708
Yes, it did.

833
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:46,958
Once, when they were very young...

834
01:01:47,542 --> 01:01:49,792
I returned home from the market...

835
01:01:50,167 --> 01:01:52,750
I had the key to the flat
with me.

836
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:56,208
When I opened the door,
there was no one inside.

837
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:58,458
It was absolutely quiet.

838
01:01:58,958 --> 01:02:02,916
Suddenly, I heard a banging sound
from my bedroom.

839
01:02:02,917 --> 01:02:04,874
I hurried to the room...

840
01:02:04,875 --> 01:02:07,917
And realised the sound
was coming from the cupboard.

841
01:02:08,542 --> 01:02:11,333
And I heard Pihu and Lisa crying.

842
01:02:11,667 --> 01:02:13,000
Kuhu?

843
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,875
Yes, it was Kuhu.

844
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:27,875
I have a request.

845
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:31,082
I want to take Pihu home with me.

846
01:02:31,083 --> 01:02:36,292
I believe she'll recover sooner
if she's with me.

847
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:40,625
Pihu will get better
if she stays with me.

848
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,958
Okay... as you wish.

849
01:02:44,125 --> 01:02:47,417
(song playing)

850
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:36,375
Listen, I'll have to get going
or I'll be late.

851
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:39,041
I've arranged for all the things
you might need.

852
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:40,957
If you need anything else,
give me a call.

853
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:42,166
Okay.

854
01:03:42,167 --> 01:03:44,166
I've brought you home
from your mother

855
01:03:44,167 --> 01:03:46,625
because I know you'll recover quickly
if you're with me.

856
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,708
But I'll have to go to office.
I don't have an option.

857
01:03:53,833 --> 01:03:54,833
Take care

858
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:56,917
And one more thing,

859
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,374
One more thing...

860
01:03:59,375 --> 01:04:02,792
If the bell rings,
you don't have to open the door

861
01:04:03,417 --> 01:04:05,750
There's no need.

862
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:09,167
If you need anything just call me.

863
01:04:09,500 --> 01:04:11,667
- Bye.
- Bye.

864
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:11,542
Uff!

865
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:19,958
- Who is it?
- It's Lisa. Open the door.

866
01:06:21,292 --> 01:06:22,792
Open up!

867
01:06:24,542 --> 01:06:25,542
Come in.

868
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:35,875
What happened?

869
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:38,083
I need to tell you something Pihu.

870
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,000
Yes, sit down.

871
01:06:42,792 --> 01:06:44,667
What is it?

872
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:48,750
Police had summoned me.

873
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:54,958
I've told them everything, Pihu.

874
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,000
What have you told them?

875
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:59,999
What do you mean?

876
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:04,250
You know them…
Agnibesh Chatterjee and Tamal Sen.

877
01:07:04,375 --> 01:07:06,374
They interrogated me.

878
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:12,083
The same ones who spoke to you
regarding Tanushree's death.

879
01:07:12,292 --> 01:07:13,917
But what have you told him?

880
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:15,416
I've told them everything, Pihu.

881
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:17,292
What've you told them?
I don't get you.

882
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,166
What do you have to tell them?

883
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,250
The fact that Tanushree's death
was not suicide...

884
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:23,874
And that Kuhu had pushed her.

885
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:25,750
What?

886
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:31,417
Pihu, the day Kuhu dressed up as you
and kissed Durjoy...

887
01:07:31,542 --> 01:07:35,041
That evening, Tanushree met Kuhu

888
01:07:35,042 --> 01:07:38,625
at their under-construction flat
at Rajarhat.

889
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:42,333
Kuhu and I were on our way
to City Centre.

890
01:07:42,625 --> 01:07:46,542
Kuhu went to meet Tanushree
and I accompanied her.

891
01:07:46,875 --> 01:07:48,333
Tanushree...

892
01:07:53,708 --> 01:07:55,167
Hey...

893
01:07:55,708 --> 01:07:58,208
What do you think?

894
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,249
What do you you two sisters think?

895
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:03,166
Why? What's wrong?
I don't understand...

896
01:08:03,167 --> 01:08:04,750
- Shut up!
- I don't get it.

897
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,750
Just shut up, okay?

898
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:10,458
Don't pretend.

899
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:14,208
You're behaving
as if you don't know anything.

900
01:08:14,667 --> 01:08:16,083
Nothing!

901
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,250
I'm really clueless about
what you're trying to say.

902
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:27,166
Your sister, Preyashee and Durjoy…

903
01:08:27,167 --> 01:08:32,625
I saw them kissing today.

904
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:37,582
You two sisters are hand in glove.
Yeah?

905
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:41,999
No, no, no...
No, Tanushree, you're absolutely wrong!

906
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,374
Please listen to me, listen to me…

907
01:08:44,375 --> 01:08:46,582
I consider you to be my friend.

908
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:48,416
You're my friend… I… abso...

909
01:08:48,417 --> 01:08:49,833
Shut up!

910
01:08:50,375 --> 01:08:53,542
Hey, listen to me carefully…

911
01:08:53,583 --> 01:08:55,166
Durjoy is mine, okay?

912
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:58,833
He belongs to me…
his everything is mine. Got it?

913
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:04,042
This flat…
This flat's location, block…

914
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:08,833
I've chosen all this myself…

915
01:09:09,167 --> 01:09:13,625
Everything! This is my world… Mine!

916
01:09:14,333 --> 01:09:16,583
Oh! No, no, no...

917
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:19,250
I'm really sorry.
I'm very sorry…

918
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:22,375
This is our world.

919
01:09:23,375 --> 01:09:26,375
And I won't let any third person

920
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:31,458
to intrude into this world of ours!

921
01:09:32,250 --> 01:09:34,042
Hey, you!

922
01:09:34,458 --> 01:09:36,125
I'm talking to you.

923
01:09:36,375 --> 01:09:39,457
Not you, not even your sister…
Okay?

924
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:42,582
You got it?
Now get lost.

925
01:09:42,583 --> 01:09:44,542
Out!

926
01:09:46,375 --> 01:09:48,833
Kuhu, let's go… Kuhu!

927
01:10:08,583 --> 01:10:10,292
Tanushree…

928
01:10:13,625 --> 01:10:19,083
Even I'll not like anybody
to intrude into…

929
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:22,042
my world.

930
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:23,750
What?

931
01:10:47,292 --> 01:10:49,292
What did you do?

932
01:10:52,417 --> 01:10:55,374
No, no, no, no, no, no…

933
01:10:55,375 --> 01:10:56,416
Let's go.

934
01:10:56,417 --> 01:10:58,542
What did you just do?

935
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:01,250
No...

936
01:11:02,875 --> 01:11:04,333
Hey!

937
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:09,750
Nothing has happened.

938
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,916
Nothing has happened.
You haven't seen anything.

939
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:17,250
And I haven't done anything.

940
01:11:17,833 --> 01:11:22,249
This was entirely Pihu's plan, okay?

941
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:25,875
Pihu's plan that I've just executed.

942
01:11:25,917 --> 01:11:31,291
So that she gets Durjoy in her life.

943
01:11:31,292 --> 01:11:37,833
I've just removed the obstacle
from Pihu's life. That's all.

944
01:11:39,333 --> 01:11:47,333
You'll never talk about this to anyone
in your entire life.

945
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:54,625
Neither with Kuhu,
nor with Pihu, got it?

946
01:11:56,667 --> 01:11:58,792
Such lies!

947
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:01,042
Lisa...

948
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:06,207
I... I didn't know anything.

949
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:09,749
I had nothing to do with
Tanushree's murder!

950
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,957
- Kuhu has lied to you.
- Oh my God!

951
01:12:12,958 --> 01:12:18,542
Tanushree... She killed Tanushree...

952
01:12:19,292 --> 01:12:22,083
I cannot believe this.

953
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:26,792
I can't imagine this, Lisa…

954
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:30,167
I'm shocked, I'm shocked, Lisa…

955
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:32,083
Trust me.

956
01:12:32,208 --> 01:12:35,082
I haven't done anything.
I wasn't involved.

957
01:12:35,083 --> 01:12:36,708
Kuhu has lied to you.

958
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:40,041
You can't say anything to the police
about me because it's all a lie.

959
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:42,375
- I haven't done anything...
- I know, I know.

960
01:12:42,833 --> 01:12:45,749
I know and that's why I did not say
anything to the police regarding this.

961
01:12:45,750 --> 01:12:47,582
Please don't say anything to them.

962
01:12:47,583 --> 01:12:49,416
You know the truth now.

963
01:12:49,417 --> 01:12:51,541
If you say anything to the police
about me...

964
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:56,582
- Then my future with Durjoy will be over!
- No, no.

965
01:12:56,583 --> 01:13:02,374
- I won't be able to live without Durjoy.
- You can trust me.

966
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:03,541
I am innocent.

967
01:13:03,542 --> 01:13:07,042
- Please don't tell the police anything.
- I can understand.

968
01:13:11,125 --> 01:13:12,125
Coffee?

969
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:19,833
When my mind starts ticking,
something bad happens, Durjoy.

970
01:13:20,417 --> 01:13:24,583
My intuition is telling me,
something bad is about to happen tonight.

971
01:13:25,208 --> 01:13:27,958
If you are right then…

972
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:36,167
I'm ready to help the administration
in all possible ways.

973
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,458
You should be.

974
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:50,542
Kuhu!

975
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,250
Hey!

976
01:14:02,042 --> 01:14:04,042
Up, up, up…go up…

977
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:12,250
Kuhu, I'm here.
Where are you?

978
01:14:12,417 --> 01:14:14,333
Kuhu!

979
01:14:17,083 --> 01:14:19,875
Where are you?

980
01:14:35,583 --> 01:14:39,125
Kuhu! Kuhu!

981
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:47,458
Stop! Stop!
What are you doing?

982
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:50,042
Stop! I said stop!

983
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:30,833
Stop! Stop!
I'll be forced to shoot you! Stop!

984
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:46,667
You recovered pretty fast, Preyashee Sen…

985
01:15:47,625 --> 01:15:49,417
You discarded your wheelchair...

986
01:15:49,708 --> 01:15:52,708
you ran from the taxi
into the apartment.

987
01:15:52,833 --> 01:15:54,667
Underconstruction...

988
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,875
- Durjoy, please listen to me.
- Shut up.

989
01:16:00,667 --> 01:16:02,042
Shut up!

990
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:05,458
Don't say another word.

991
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,249
Sit… Just sit…

992
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:11,083
- I just…
- Keep quiet.

993
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:18,667
Can I come in?

994
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,541
Oh God!

995
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:26,750
I'm exhausted!
Durjoy, please sit...

996
01:16:27,167 --> 01:16:28,832
Nice to see you again, dear.

997
01:16:28,833 --> 01:16:32,333
Please be seated, Durjoy.
Ah! My God!

998
01:16:34,792 --> 01:16:35,999
Here it is...

999
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,833
Excuse me, dear...

1000
01:16:47,208 --> 01:16:51,375
You dropped this watch
at Durjoy's under-construction flat.

1001
01:16:53,833 --> 01:16:56,582
- Why did you try to kill Lisa, dear?
- Are you mad?

1002
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:58,207
Why would I try to kill Lisa?

1003
01:16:58,208 --> 01:17:00,832
Lisa… Kuhu tried to kill her…

1004
01:17:00,833 --> 01:17:03,791
Lisa told me herself on the phone.

1005
01:17:03,792 --> 01:17:06,000
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't tell you because…

1006
01:17:06,042 --> 01:17:09,291
I didn't want to disturb you.
I informed Pilu!

1007
01:17:09,292 --> 01:17:10,750
Oh, Pilu was there?

1008
01:17:12,708 --> 01:17:15,875
I don't know because…

1009
01:17:15,917 --> 01:17:18,374
I didn't get him on phone…

1010
01:17:18,375 --> 01:17:21,082
His phone was not reachable.

1011
01:17:21,083 --> 01:17:25,458
Call him now.
You'll get through to him.

1012
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,208
Call him.

1013
01:17:28,083 --> 01:17:31,500
A little while ago it was not reachable.
I had called him.

1014
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,625
Put it on speaker.

1015
01:17:38,333 --> 01:17:39,417
Lisa...

1016
01:17:40,417 --> 01:17:42,583
Lisa, did you reach?
Is Kuhu there?

1017
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:48,000
Hello! She's not talking!

1018
01:17:48,125 --> 01:17:49,625
Keep the phone here…

1019
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,375
Keep it right here…

1020
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:54,583
Put it down!

1021
01:17:54,708 --> 01:17:57,375
Lisa, have you reached home safely?

1022
01:17:57,667 --> 01:17:59,999
Hello Lisa, if you can hear me…

1023
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,458
Then...

1024
01:18:02,667 --> 01:18:05,083
Please disconnect the call, Lisa.

1025
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,625
I've a lot to tell you, Lisa.

1026
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:13,375
I have a lot to tell you too.

1027
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:16,291
I can't understand anything.

1028
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:18,333
You can understand everything, dear.

1029
01:18:18,958 --> 01:18:20,542
Everything…

1030
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:25,667
What you can't understand is
how did the police know.

1031
01:18:26,417 --> 01:18:29,166
I need to start from the beginning.
Shall I start?

1032
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,208
Let me begin, Durjoy…

1033
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:33,708
Tanushree did not commit suicide.

1034
01:18:35,958 --> 01:18:40,833
Kuhu had pushed her
off the window.

1035
01:18:41,667 --> 01:18:43,499
I was there.

1036
01:18:43,500 --> 01:18:46,291
And in order to know what you did,

1037
01:18:46,292 --> 01:18:49,042
I'd summoned Lisa to the station.

1038
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:51,208
I'd told Lisa what to tell you.

1039
01:18:51,667 --> 01:18:56,207
As if Kuhu has told Lisa

1040
01:18:56,208 --> 01:18:58,791
that the original plan was yours.

1041
01:18:58,792 --> 01:19:01,041
And Kuhu has only executed it.

1042
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:03,125
I executed it.

1043
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:05,875
Now you got scared, dear.

1044
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:09,125
You thought Lisa will spill the beans…

1045
01:19:09,625 --> 01:19:13,042
And we'll come to know
about your involvement…

1046
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,750
But you know what, we, the police…

1047
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:22,417
we're so cunning that
I feel bad sometimes…

1048
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:27,458
I was told that this is the only thing
that will scare her.

1049
01:19:27,708 --> 01:19:32,875
And she'll try to get rid
of all the evidence.

1050
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,542
And she'll definitely call me
disguised as Kuhu.

1051
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:42,083
- He's lying! He's lying!
- Hey! Hey!

1052
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:45,249
Look at the phone…
Swipe it and look.

1053
01:19:45,250 --> 01:19:46,833
Look at the pictures!

1054
01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,875
- Sir!
- Hmm?

1055
01:19:53,125 --> 01:19:55,042
A dead body was found, sir!

1056
01:19:55,208 --> 01:19:57,167
At 5a.m. today…

1057
01:19:57,542 --> 01:20:01,875
- This body was found near Chandpurghat!
- Let me see.

1058
01:20:08,833 --> 01:20:13,417
These are just photographs, Durjoy!

1059
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:19,083
Just photos...

1060
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:24,166
Don't believe it!
Please don't.

1061
01:20:24,167 --> 01:20:27,957
- Pihu, tell me the truth.
- Believe me! You believe me!

1062
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:31,041
- Durjoy, don't… Don't believe.
- Tell me the truth.

1063
01:20:31,042 --> 01:20:32,374
- Don't believe...
- Pihu, tell me the truth.

1064
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,957
Pihu, tell me the truth.
I want the bloody truth!

1065
01:20:34,958 --> 01:20:39,208
The bloody truth, right now! Please,
please. For God's sake, please!

1066
01:20:41,708 --> 01:20:44,708
Please, Pihu, please.

1067
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:49,625
Please...

1068
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:58,750
I had to kill her…
I had to kill her…

1069
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:02,542
What else could I've done?
I had to kill her!

1070
01:21:03,208 --> 01:21:07,875
How could I share you
with anybody, Durjoy?

1071
01:21:08,625 --> 01:21:13,125
Therefore I had to… Listen…

1072
01:21:13,750 --> 01:21:16,125
Before our wedding she had said…

1073
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:19,082
You'll satisfy him intellectually
and I'll satisfy him in bed.

1074
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:23,457
Can you imagine?
We three will be in… Paradise!

1075
01:21:23,458 --> 01:21:24,833
Can you imagine?

1076
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,042
Can anybody share their love?

1077
01:21:27,083 --> 01:21:28,332
Murderer?

1078
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,833
No!

1079
01:21:30,208 --> 01:21:31,833
No!

1080
01:21:32,042 --> 01:21:33,750
I know Kuhu!

1081
01:21:33,917 --> 01:21:36,875
I took her for a ride…

1082
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:39,541
I'm telling you… I took her for a ride!

1083
01:21:39,542 --> 01:21:42,417
But I failed in the first attempt.

1084
01:22:16,083 --> 01:22:21,833
(song playing)

1085
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:42,667
I didn't think she'll come back to life.

1086
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:46,874
Then she started responding…
Started speaking…

1087
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:51,000
Again! Again! Again!
She was coming back!

1088
01:22:51,292 --> 01:22:53,958
So again I had to do something.

1089
01:22:54,292 --> 01:22:59,875
I lied to you about the early morning
flight to get you out of the house.

1090
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:04,792
Then, at night…

1091
01:23:41,833 --> 01:23:45,083
She suffocated her…in that room.

1092
01:23:45,500 --> 01:23:48,375
- Can you help me?
- What happened?

1093
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:56,167
Pilu... Pilu, I've made a mistake…

1094
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:03,958
Kuhu!

1095
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:07,500
She's dead! She's no more!
Just help me.

1096
01:24:08,500 --> 01:24:10,750
Come on! Come on! Help me!

1097
01:24:20,833 --> 01:24:23,417
Come on...
Let's take her to the car.

1098
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:29,583
We put her in the boot of the car.

1099
01:24:30,625 --> 01:24:32,375
Then she drove away.

1100
01:24:32,417 --> 01:24:34,083
Do you know what she told me?

1101
01:24:34,167 --> 01:24:39,250
She told me that
no one will know I'm involved.

1102
01:24:39,292 --> 01:24:42,167
I had no other option
but to help her, Lisa.

1103
01:24:42,458 --> 01:24:47,625
I drove the body to Chandpur.

1104
01:25:00,500 --> 01:25:04,999
- Basically, you and Kuhu are the same.
- I love you, I love you.

1105
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,499
- You're both murderers. It's pointless.
- Durjoy, I love you.

1106
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:16,042
- And I can't live with someone like you.
- I love you... I love you...

1107
01:25:16,333 --> 01:25:17,916
I love you so much!

1108
01:25:17,917 --> 01:25:19,583
- Agnibesh...
- Tell me…

1109
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:27,000
- Do what you have to... please...
- I love you...

1110
01:25:29,542 --> 01:25:36,750
I love you... I love you...
I love you...

1111
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:40,083
Let's go, dear…

1112
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:42,792
Get up, let's go!

1113
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:50,333
Have you ever fallen in love?

1114
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:54,499
If you had
then I could've made you understand.

1115
01:25:54,500 --> 01:25:58,625
But if you don't know
how it feels like then…

1116
01:26:00,042 --> 01:26:01,375
Six months…

1117
01:26:01,417 --> 01:26:04,042
I married her after a six months affair!

1118
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:07,667
Then after two years,
we had a kid.

1119
01:26:08,125 --> 01:26:09,458
A daughter.

1120
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:14,667
After four years, my wife left me
for a stupid friend of mine.

1121
01:26:17,958 --> 01:26:21,625
I could've killed my friend
but I didn't, my dear.

1122
01:26:24,208 --> 01:26:27,208
And actually,
I should've murdered my wife.

1123
01:26:29,292 --> 01:26:32,083
You had a great life, fair life!

1124
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:36,625
I can sleep with you…
at regular intervals.

1125
01:26:37,542 --> 01:26:38,874
I'm not going to mention the money...

1126
01:26:38,875 --> 01:26:44,083
because I'll give you any amount you want
whenever you want it.

1127
01:26:45,583 --> 01:26:50,250
I'm… I'm very good in bed!

1128
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:52,542
You know, I can…

1129
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:10,458
The fact that your wife left you
must be your fault too.

1130
01:27:10,792 --> 01:27:12,667
Now this is serious, okay?

1131
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:16,417
Are you sure your daughter
is biologically yours?

1132
01:27:20,042 --> 01:27:23,125
If I kill you now, you slut...

1133
01:27:25,042 --> 01:27:29,042
it'll be recorded as an encounter
in the police files.

1134
01:27:48,458 --> 01:27:50,917
Yes, Agnibesh, tell me.

1135
01:27:51,292 --> 01:27:53,417
'Forever Yours'…

1136
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:56,542
I love you.

1137
01:27:57,333 --> 01:27:59,708
I'm coming to you…

1138
01:28:00,417 --> 01:28:03,542
I'm coming, Durjoy.
I'm coming.
