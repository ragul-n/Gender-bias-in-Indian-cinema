1
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:02,790
Obstinacy

2
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,290
'I love you more than myself.'

3
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,750
'You're the one for me.'

4
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,540
'The heart is obsessed'

5
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,880
'about making you mine.'

6
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:08,130
'I want to immerse
myself in you.'

7
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,460
'Look into my eyes.'

8
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,000
'You can see me in you.'

9
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:22,710
'I love you more than myself.'

10
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,000
'You're the one for me.'

11
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:31,710
'The heart is obsessed'

12
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,420
'about making you mine.'

13
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,040
Officer.
- Yes?

14
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,960
You spared some time for us
in this bad weather.

15
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,460
We're truly grateful for that.

16
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,420
That's the kind of
relationship we share.

17
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,460
I always come
whenever you call me.

18
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,960
I just told you about Rohan.
What do you think?

19
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,670
It's an interesting story.

20
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,420
I've cracked
many difficult cases.

21
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,580
But Rohan's story has
so many anomalies.

22
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,750
You'll see Rohan in a while.
He is a bit shaken up.

23
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,330
But you have
to help him. Please.

24
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,830
Consider it done.
- Sir..

25
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,960
Come on.

26
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,000
You should come home someday.

27
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,460
All we do is
talk over the phone.

28
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,130
Please come.

29
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,170
Tea?

30
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:15,750
Yes, please.

31
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,500
Our police station
and your newspaper office

32
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,170
are the safest places.

33
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,880
Karan updated me
about your case.

34
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,380
But I want to hear it from you.

35
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,960
In detail.

36
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,130
Hey, Ronnie.
Are you done with the story?

37
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,460
I already mailed it to you.
- What's your take?

38
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,460
Well.. A 32 to
35 year old woman.

39
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,170
Depression.
Husband is in the Gulf.

40
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,130
Found with a licensed pistol
in her right hand in a hammock.

41
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,750
They also found a suicide note.

42
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:56,130
According to the police,
it's an open and shut case.

43
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,500
And..

44
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,880
What's your verdict?

45
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,500
Murder.

46
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,040
Successful! Beautiful!

47
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,210
And in the end just awful!

48
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,500
Just like every love affair.

49
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,500
Did Priya call?

50
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,130
Come on, man. Enough is enough.

51
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,670
It's been almost a year
since Priya moved to London.

52
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,420
Since then she hasn't called
or replied to your emails.

53
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,710
What does it mean?

54
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:37,210
She has gone. Forget her.

55
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,380
I'm looking for ways
to forget her.

56
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,210
Don't change your house,
change your bed instead.

57
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,080
You need to sleep
with someone, buddy.

58
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:48,380
Get laid.

59
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,790
Really.

60
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,080
There's a property
on Coco Beach.

61
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,830
The landlord lives
in the main house

62
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,540
but he also has an outhouse.
Let me know if that suits you.

63
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,580
I have met his daughter
couple of times.

64
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,790
Who's more attractive
the girl or the outhouse?

65
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,920
I'd say a girl in the outhouse!

66
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:17,830
Your cabin is like
your sex life buddy.

67
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,380
Start the engines.

68
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,920
But she wasn't an ordinary girl.

69
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,290
Hello.

70
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,500
Hello?

71
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:12,250
Hello?

72
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,670
Hello.

73
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,960
Oh, shucks! Be careful.

74
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:41,580
Excuse me. Don't be scared.

75
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,250
He is my pet.

76
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,920
You have a pet too.
- Yes, but..

77
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,880
So why are you being scared?

78
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,880
But that's a..

79
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,210
He was just 2 months old.
He was very badly injured.

80
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:58,630
Had I not brought him home,
he would've died.

81
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,880
I'll keep him here
for another month

82
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,000
and later, I'll set him free
in a lake.

83
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,330
Are you the landlord's daughter?
- Yes.

84
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,710
Actually Karan has
recommended this place.

85
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,920
Why do I feel that
I've seen you before?

86
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,130
I have a pretty
common face, right?

87
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,670
I mean to say..

88
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,330
The outhouse is over there.

89
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,750
There..

90
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,330
Thanks.

91
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,500
You're welcome.

92
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,500
You're welcome, Mr. Neighbor.

93
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,580
Hey!

94
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,210
You?

95
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,290
I've called an electrician

96
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,420
but he'll come
tomorrow morning.

97
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,040
Be careful!

98
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,830
Thanks, Ronnie.

99
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,880
Hey..

100
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,500
How do you know my name?

101
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,830
I don't know your name.

102
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,330
But didn't you call me by my
name when you said 'Hey Ronnie'.

103
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,880
No. Never.

104
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,290
You're trying so hard

105
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,130
to find out my name.
then I am Maya.

106
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,080
Nice meeting you, Ronnie.

107
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,500
See. You know my name.

108
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,500
You just said
your name is Ronnie.

109
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,630
Fuse box!

110
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:50,080
Oh, God!

111
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,830
Come on, sister, pick up.

112
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,290
Hi, sister, you didn't..

113
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,830
Fine. Forget it.
I have to tell you something.

114
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,460
You know what?

115
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,290
Your words are
literally coming true.

116
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,920
You predicted love
at first sight in my case.

117
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,960
That's exactly what happened.
I'm in love.

118
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,080
He moved here a while ago and..

119
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,210
Hey..

120
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,580
Hey, little Bobby.

121
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,460
What's up, little buddy?

122
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,630
Yes.

123
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,540
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

124
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,000
Maya ma'am asked me
to come here.

125
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,960
I am the electrician.

126
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,880
Sir, it'll take
a few more minutes.

127
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,670
How long have you been working
here? - Since I am a kid.

128
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,880
I am from Coco beach.

129
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,670
My father was also
an electrician.

130
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,420
And Maya..
The one who sent you here.

131
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,500
How long have you known her?

132
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,330
Three years.

133
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,460
Very nice lady.

134
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,630
She has been living here
since her father got ill.

135
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:12,040
She also has an elder sister
but I think she lives in Delhi.

136
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Hey!

137
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,710
Good morning.

138
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,460
Nice.

139
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,920
Good night.

140
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,830
Bye.

141
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:30,330
Oh shucks..

142
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,290
I am.. I am so sorry.

143
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,710
You sneaked up on me
and scared me.

144
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,000
Was I sneaking in?

145
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,250
Why would I sneak
into my own house?

146
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,880
By the way, why were you
snooping around in my house?

147
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,630
Well..

148
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,960
I was looking for you.

149
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:57,080
I know I am so special.
You know, I am a good habit.

150
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,920
Thank you for the electrician.
- You're welcome.

151
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:09,540
Why don't you have
dinner with us tonight?

152
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:12,210
That's okay. You don't have to..

153
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,710
I mean..
- No?

154
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,750
That can mean both
yes and no.

155
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,790
So are you coming?

156
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,670
Don't worry. My cooking is
just as special as I am.

157
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,130
Sure.
Why not.

158
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,500
I'll see you.

159
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,580
Okay.

160
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,790
Yes!

161
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,750
Is everything okay?
- Doctor..

162
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,080
I was always scared of venturing
into jungles since I was a kid.

163
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,380
But as a crime reporter
I have to go to these places.

164
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,250
I fought all my fears, doctor.

165
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,960
I never let anything defeat me.

166
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,210
But I can't face
my fear of heights.

167
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,330
Acrophobia.

168
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,540
Vertigo.

169
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,750
It's the fear of heights.

170
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,540
But why suddenly?

171
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,540
I mean I was fine until now.

172
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,710
And no one in my family
had it either.

173
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,500
It doesn't have
to be hereditary.

174
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,750
It can also be the
result of extreme stress.

175
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,920
And to fight with this stress

176
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,380
it's only love and passion.

177
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,790
Because when a person is
passionately in love

178
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,830
all his problems disappear.

179
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,710
It's been a long time
since Priya.

180
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,130
You should move on.

181
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,540
Reduce your stress.
Go out!

182
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:43,790
Go to parties. Meet new people.

183
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,540
Expand yourself.

184
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:46,540
Okay.

185
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,920
'Gold necklace
around her neck..'

186
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,790
Madam.

187
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,250
Give me the keys.
I'll hand it over to Ronnie.

188
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,250
Oh hell!

189
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,750
Hey, Ronnie.
- Yes?

190
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,290
Good morning everybody!
How are we?

191
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,630
Hello, sir.

192
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,540
How's the place?
- It's nice.

193
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:34,630
And Maya?

194
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,750
Come on, sister. Pick up.

195
00:23:57,130 --> 00:24:00,000
Hi, sister. You know what?

196
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,630
Ronnie loves me.

197
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,580
You know what?

198
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,580
He moved here for me.

199
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,540
He has got my photographs.

200
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:14,420
He saw me and followed me here.

201
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,420
He found out our outhouse
was vacant

202
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,130
and he shifted here.

203
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,790
Tonight he is
coming over for dinner.

204
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:16,830
'I felt I am so lonely
for the first time.'

205
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:35,330
'I felt I am so lonely
for the first time.'

206
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:44,330
'I am worried and
I am hapless to say.'

207
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:52,670
'I need you for staying alive.'

208
00:25:54,000 --> 00:26:01,830
'I need you for staying alive.'

209
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:12,580
'I felt I am so lonely
for the first time.'

210
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:21,630
'I am worried and
I am hapless to say.'

211
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:29,670
'I need you for staying alive.'

212
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:39,290
'I need you for staying alive.'

213
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,290
'I need you..'

214
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,040
'My heart races away'

215
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,790
'the moment
I come close to you.'

216
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,130
'Every time,
I look in the mirror'

217
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:47,790
'I see you next to me.'

218
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:57,420
'Let me wash away
in the tide of love.'

219
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:05,130
'I need you for staying alive.'

220
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:13,790
'I need you for staying alive.'

221
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:21,880
'I need you for staying alive.'

222
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,000
Are you telling me that
she fell in love with you?

223
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,540
Sort of.

224
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,040
Mr. Karan..

225
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:05,040
I thought love heals
all problems.

226
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:07,500
So why not vertigo?

227
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:34,830
Do you always drop in like this?

228
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,000
Scared, are you? Fuse box!

229
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,210
Is it 9 PM already?

230
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:50,670
But the sun hasn't set yet.

231
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,170
That's because it's not
the time for sunset yet?

232
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,540
I think I invited you to dinner.

233
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,420
I am very forgetful.

234
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Actually I'm here to invite you.
- For?

235
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,880
For a party.

236
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,540
What do you say?

237
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,790
Yeah?
- Okay.

238
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,960
Will it be too late?

239
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,130
Dad is alone at home.

240
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,710
We'll leave
whenever you want to.

241
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,210
Is it a yes or a no?
What should I do?

242
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:29,000
Yes or no?
I think it's a no, right?

243
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,130
No!

244
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,250
Yes.

245
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,630
Good.

246
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:36,880
So I'll see you.

247
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,830
Yes.

248
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:48,420
I'm going out on my date.

249
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,920
Obviously. My first date ever.

250
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,380
I'm already feeling nervous.

251
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:58,000
I wish you were here.
That would've been so good.

252
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,920
All I know is that I love him

253
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,540
and I think he loves me too.

254
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,330
Obviously. Why else would
he take me out on a date?

255
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:11,080
Date? No, I just find
her interesting.

256
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,670
She is sort of strange,
but cute.

257
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,710
No. I'm not having an affair.
At least not for some time.

258
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:18,960
You know, don't you?

259
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,790
Yeah, I'll tell her.
Of course, I'll tell..

260
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,420
I am sure she won't
misunderstand.

261
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,040
Wait. I'll call you.

262
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,330
Maya?

263
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:51,580
Ronnie, did you lose something?

264
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,460
You look gorgeous.

265
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,790
'I'm struck by love. Heal me.'

266
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:13,080
'I'm struck by love. Heal me.'

267
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:24,920
I love this place.

268
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,170
Let's head to the bar.
Come. Come on.

269
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,630
Hey, Frankie.
- Hey!

270
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,460
Pour some shots, man.
- Here you go.

271
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,080
Right from this..

272
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,880
Come on..
- No.

273
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,880
Please. For me. Please.

274
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:49,830
'You're my desire.
You're my intoxication.'

275
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,630
'My heart is your slave.'

276
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,880
'I wish to live with you
with no bounds.'

277
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,710
'Come and dwell in my breath.'

278
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,920
'You're my desire.
You're my intoxication.'

279
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,960
'My heart is your slave.'

280
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:08,040
'I wish to live with you
with no bounds.'

281
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,880
'Come and dwell in my breath.'

282
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,790
'I'm struck by love. Heal me.'

283
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,830
'Come and touch my heart.'

284
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,130
'Come and touch my heart.'

285
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,710
Sister, I'm going
to tell him tonight.

286
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,830
I'm going to tell him.

287
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:47,580
I love you.

288
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,920
Fuse box.

289
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,000
Ronnie! Hi!

290
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,710
Nancy?

291
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,830
Wow!
- Come on!

292
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,210
Oh, my God!
- Nancy!

293
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,250
How are you?
- I am good. How are you?

294
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:07,960
I am not talking to you.

295
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,710
You broke up with my sister.
How could you forget me?

296
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,250
You changed your phone number,
but didn't tell me.

297
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,000
You broke all contact..
- Okay. Okay.

298
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,670
Had I met you, you would've
reminded me of her.

299
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,750
I just wanted to get away
from everything.

300
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:23,040
For a while.

301
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:25,080
Okay now.
I'll take your number.

302
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,040
You will call me.
- I will call you.

303
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,580
Promise?
- I promise.

304
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,330
It's the same number, right?
- Yeah.

305
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,250
Are you okay now?

306
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,250
Okay, let's dance.
Guys, let's dance.

307
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:39,000
Come on. Let's go.
- Come on!

308
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,460
Oh, my God!
- Hey..

309
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,420
Ronnie!

310
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,920
'God brought you to me.'

311
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,920
'I made you mine.'

312
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,500
'Don't ever separate from me.'

313
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:11,080
'Love is essential
for the soul.'

314
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,170
'Come and touch my heart.'

315
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:21,290
'Come and touch my heart.'

316
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,830
See you, Ronnie! Bye.
- Bye.

317
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,670
Where have you been?

318
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,710
Come on.

319
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,750
No, I don't want it.

320
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,080
What happened? Something wrong?

321
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,540
No, it's just..

322
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,080
Bad mood.

323
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,580
Now?

324
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,000
It's just my mood.

325
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,000
It's better now.

326
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,540
I am in a good mood now.

327
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,420
And I didn't know
you were so moody.

328
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:12,170
But I was a moody girl.

329
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,330
Then I thought,
we just get one life

330
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,920
why waste it?

331
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,330
Moods no longer control me

332
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,250
I'm in control of my moods.

333
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,170
You know what? You're such a..

334
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,040
Such a cute doll.

335
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:26,750
Can we have some music?
- Sure.

336
00:36:27,290 --> 00:36:29,040
Rock?
- Hip-Hop!

337
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:31,830
Hip-Hop!
- Or jazz.

338
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,290
You have 'Bhangra'?
- Do you like any music?

339
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,290
I like the music you like.

340
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,710
Fuse box!

341
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,080
Fuse box?

342
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,710
Ronnie!

343
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,380
Oh shucks!

344
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,040
Oh my God!
Maya!

345
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,880
Who was driving on
the wrong side of the road?

346
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,630
It was raining heavily
and it was very dark.

347
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:07,170
I don't know
who was on the wrong side.

348
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,580
You didn't try to call
the police and fled the scene.

349
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:14,790
I didn't run.

350
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,540
Shucks! What have I done!

351
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:20,630
Oh, my God! Shucks!

352
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,170
Is anybody there?

353
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,920
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

354
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,290
Oh, my God!

355
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,000
Maya!

356
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:39,420
Maya, come here!

357
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:42,000
Maya, someone's down there.
- Ronnie!

358
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,670
What happened?
- Someone's there, Maya.

359
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,000
How can I be so stupid?

360
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,420
What happened?
- Someone's down there!

361
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,960
I have vertigo. You have to take
him out. - Will you relax?

362
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,420
We have to save this person!

363
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,710
Maya!
- Relax.

364
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:54,830
We need to take her
to the hospital. - Just relax!

365
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,830
Ronnie, I am a nurse.
I'll take care of him.

366
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,750
Wait here.
Just wait, I'm coming.

367
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,210
Don't move from here, okay?
Just wait here!

368
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:04,420
Shucks!

369
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,290
Help! Somebody help!

370
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,630
Help!

371
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,630
Is anybody there?

372
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:12,420
Help us!

373
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,170
Maya! Is everything okay?

374
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,080
Maya, is she okay?

375
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,630
Ronnie!

376
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,460
Maya, please tell me
everything is alright!

377
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,830
Ronnie!

378
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,250
Ronnie!

379
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,500
Help! Anybody there?

380
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,540
Anybody there?

381
00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:56,920
God!

382
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,750
Maya, tell me what happened.

383
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,790
Ronnie, too late.

384
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,290
What?
- She's dead.

385
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:09,210
Maya, what do you mean?
- I tried my level best.

386
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,710
We can't stay here any longer.

387
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,380
Are you out of
your freaking mind?

388
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,960
How can we leave her here?
- Listen to me.

389
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,330
We can't stay here
any longer! - Maya.

390
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,630
It's dark here
and it's raining heavily.

391
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,880
If the police find out..
Don't forget you're drunk!

392
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,500
Let's go from here.

393
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,210
Let's go. Let's go.

394
00:39:28,290 --> 00:39:30,170
Shucks!
- Come on!

395
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:32,250
What if someone finds out, Maya?
- Come on.

396
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,420
Maya, listen.

397
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,790
Listen to me.
- Let's go.

398
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,540
Get inside the car!

399
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,750
I killed her!

400
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,040
I killed her!

401
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,380
I killed her! I killed her!

402
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,000
I killed her!

403
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,380
I killed her! I killed her!

404
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,540
I killed her!
- Calm down, Ronnie.

405
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,380
I killed her!
- Ronnie, just calm down.

406
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,290
Why..

407
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,000
Ronnie. It was her fault.

408
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:15,540
It was dark and raining heavily

409
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:18,880
and she was speeding on
the one-way street.

410
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,330
She was drunk too.

411
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:23,210
We should go to the police.

412
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:25,210
We'll confess everything.
- Ronnie.

413
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:27,330
I'm telling you. This..

414
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,420
Ronnie, I'm a single woman!

415
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,290
And if the police find out..

416
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,290
Drunk driving!

417
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:40,580
Attempt to murder.

418
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,500
Who will look after
my father?

419
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:51,380
What.. What will
I tell my sister?

420
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:54,500
We can't go to the police.
Don't do this.

421
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,880
Maya, I am so sorry.

422
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,130
Ronnie, you're not
alone in this.

423
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,000
Even I am there.

424
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,290
Maya.

425
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:08,420
Please.

426
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,420
Maya, I am sorry.

427
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:14,540
Relax.
- You'll be fine, Maya.

428
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,630
Bobby, don't..

429
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,630
Breakfast?

430
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,040
Eat something.

431
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,080
I don't feel like eating.

432
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,380
At least, have some coffee.

433
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,920
You haven't eaten
since last night.

434
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,210
Just leave me alone.

435
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,210
Fine.

436
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,750
You got a call from Karan.

437
00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:08,000
He told me

438
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:11,170
that the girl who died in the
accident was at the party too.

439
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:14,380
Did he say a name?
- He said some girl Nancy.

440
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,460
Hey!

441
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,130
I am so sorry, little buddy!
But daddy is in a deep mess.

442
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:45,250
You'll report about
the flood in Margaon.

443
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:46,460
Figure out who is
your photographer.

444
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,130
I want impactful visuals.

445
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:50,210
The water should look neck-deep.
Alright.

446
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,170
Hey, Ronnie.

447
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:52,290
I'll talk to you later.

448
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,500
Good, you're here.

449
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:59,420
I think you should cover
the hit-and-run story.

450
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,460
Sorry? Which story?

451
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,000
I called you for this.
Didn't Maya inform you?

452
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,290
That one..

453
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:10,000
Yes. Some hit-and-run.

454
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,290
Some hit-and-run?

455
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,210
Ronnie, I am serious.

456
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,830
Didn't Maya tell you
anything about Nancy?

457
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,000
What happened to Nancy?

458
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:23,880
Oh!
- What?

459
00:44:25,290 --> 00:44:26,210
Shucks!

460
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,330
You mean? No!
- Hey, man!

461
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,540
You mean to say that..

462
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,750
Shucks! Nancy is dead.

463
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,330
You mean to say
that Nancy is dead?

464
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,540
I must call Priya.
- Hey, listen.

465
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,250
Listen, man. Listen.

466
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:40,500
I understand what
you're going through

467
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,250
and I am really sorry.
But this is big!

468
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:45,500
I mean we shouldn't give up

469
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,000
on this story thinking
it's just an accident.

470
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,670
Come on, man!
Don't you understand?

471
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,290
This has the ingredients
of a huge lead story!

472
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,130
A lonely girl on
a desolate road.

473
00:44:55,210 --> 00:44:57,420
It was very dark
and it was raining.

474
00:44:57,500 --> 00:45:00,290
And then hit-and-run. Boom!

475
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,420
My friend,
this is up your street.

476
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,460
Make it happen.
Find me some controversy.

477
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,540
Shame the cops.
Embarrass the government.

478
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,790
Come on, man!
Get me a rocking story

479
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,670
which can stay on our
front page for weeks.

480
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,750
Hey! Hey! Listen!

481
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,880
Give it to Thomas. Give it
to Rita. Give it to somebody!

482
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,250
But I am already following up
with the Sonia murder case.

483
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:22,420
I can't help you. I am sorry.

484
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,960
Hey, Ronnie?

485
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:26,250
Any problems?

486
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,670
The Deputy Superintendent of
Police is taking an interest

487
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:34,380
in the Sonia Singh murder case
So I can't delay.

488
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:37,210
Ronnie, I asked any problems?

489
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,080
No. Why?

490
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,790
You've been working for me as
a crime report for four years.

491
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,500
And this is the first time
that you're late.

492
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,880
What's up?
- Actually my car broke down.

493
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,210
There were no taxis
available either.

494
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:50,500
And the date?

495
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,630
Date?

496
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:57,830
Maya and you went out
on a date, didn't you?

497
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:00,000
Nothing of that sort.

498
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,790
I am just trying to know her.
- Oh listen.

499
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:04,380
Explore away. I believe you.

500
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:06,290
In fact, I'm with you on this.

501
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:09,420
But hey. Take my car
and go to the site.

502
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,790
Don't worry.
I'll talk to the DSP.

503
00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:14,210
Don't worry about the minister.

504
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:18,500
The favorable articles
our newspaper wrote

505
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,830
after the minister's son rammed
his Skoda into a school bus

506
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,080
is the reason he still has
a sterling reputation.

507
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:29,630
So the minister owes us
big time.

508
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,460
Don't worry.

509
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,000
Go on.

510
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,630
Make me proud.

511
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,170
Help, Ronnie!

512
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,080
Ronnie, help me!

513
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,960
Ronnie!

514
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,290
Hello, Mr. Rohan Achrekar.

515
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,080
Any leads?

516
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,040
Was it a truck or a pick-up?

517
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:48,380
Bus or car?

518
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,710
What's your guess,
Mr. Crime Reporter?

519
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:54,790
I guess investigation is
your job, not mine.

520
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,250
Who was the driver?

521
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:58,790
Was he rash? Or he just
didn't see it coming?

522
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,710
Or was he drunk?

523
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,670
His car could've skidded.

524
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,880
I'm trying to unfold
the mysteries behind this case.

525
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:11,500
Because there's something
bigger than evidence.

526
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,540
Truth!

527
00:48:13,130 --> 00:48:16,750
I uncover the truth and
don't just gather evidence.

528
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,330
Whatever.

529
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:50,580
Shucks! Where's my car?

530
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:54,460
Maya!

531
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,540
Maya!

532
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:04,380
Maya!

533
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,960
Maya..

534
00:50:11,170 --> 00:50:13,080
Everything was so dirty.

535
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:15,130
I thought I'll clean the place.
- Where's my car?

536
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,750
Your mirror..

537
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:22,380
You write everything on it.
- Where the heck is my car?

538
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:25,710
Your towels.
Look, how dirty..

539
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,790
Where the heck is my car, Maya?

540
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,130
Don't get hysterical, Ronnie!

541
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:32,630
I am not getting hysterical.
I am freaking scared!

542
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:34,670
My car's paint is
on Nancy's scooter.

543
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,210
Do you know what will happen
if the cops find my car?

544
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,670
I'll go to jail. I should've
never listened to you.

545
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:40,290
I shouldn't have listened
to you at all.

546
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,000
Ronnie, your car is safe!

547
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,630
Your car is safe!

548
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,790
'I love you more than myself.'

549
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:53,330
'You're the one for me.'

550
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:58,290
'The heart is obsessed'

551
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:02,460
'about making you mine.'

552
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:10,250
'I want to immerse
myself in you.'

553
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,130
Where's my car?
- 'Look into my eyes.'

554
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:14,330
Can you swim?

555
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,630
'You can see me in you.'

556
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:25,080
'I love you more than myself.'

557
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,830
'You're the one for me.'

558
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:34,500
'The heart is obsessed'

559
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,170
'about making you mine.'

560
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,170
Maya, what have you done?

561
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:44,000
Why are you complicating things?

562
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:45,420
It's still not late.

563
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:47,790
We should tell everything
to the police.

564
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:48,960
Maya.

565
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,380
Maya, stop for a second!
I am talking to you.

566
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,960
Don't you have any feelings?

567
00:51:55,790 --> 00:51:57,250
I don't have any feelings?

568
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,880
I'm doing it because
I have feelings.

569
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,420
My feelings are for you,
god darn it!

570
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,750
What's wrong if I want to
save you and save myself?

571
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,500
I am a girl.

572
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,080
A single woman.

573
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,210
But I'm trying to stay strong

574
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,040
so that you stay strong.

575
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:26,290
Maya, listen.

576
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,130
But now..

577
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:33,000
I am scared for you.

578
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:36,330
What if something
happens to you?

579
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,830
If something happens?
I am scared.

580
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:43,790
Maya..
- I am scared.

581
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,380
I am scared.
- Maya..

582
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,580
I am scared!

583
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,170
When was your car stolen?
- Saturday night.

584
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:59,880
Which car?

585
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:02,540
Scorpio.

586
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,790
Color?
- Grey.

587
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,330
License plate number?

588
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,420
GA 01 6666.

589
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:18,040
Nice number.

590
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,130
In the name of the Lord.

591
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:23,290
He that stands in
the house of the Lord's.

592
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,500
In the court of
the house of the Lord's

593
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,130
Praise the Lord,
for the Lord is good.

594
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:32,460
Sing praises onto His name,
for God, it is pleasant.

595
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,170
For the Lord has chosen
Nancy Smith

596
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,960
as His pleasant treasure.

597
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:39,460
For I know,
that the Lord is great

598
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:42,920
and that our Lord
is above all gods.

599
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,290
You killed me!

600
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:55,170
Ronnie!

601
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:58,460
You killed me!

602
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,380
No!

603
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:09,250
You okay?

604
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,000
How is your vertigo?

605
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,130
I heard your car got stolen.

606
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,960
Yes.

607
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:23,330
The car that rammed Nancy's
scooter was also grey.

608
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:30,880
Evidence number one.

609
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:33,130
Yeah?

610
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,250
Yes?

611
00:55:29,330 --> 00:55:31,250
Does Ronnie Achrekar live here?

612
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,130
Thanks.

613
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:40,380
Are you his colleague?

614
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,630
No. He is a friend.

615
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,540
Today was my sister's funeral.

616
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:47,630
You might have read
in the papers.

617
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,500
Nancy.

618
00:55:51,170 --> 00:55:53,130
I'm so sorry for your loss.

619
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:56,830
But Ronnie isn't at home.

620
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:01,880
Okay.

621
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:13,210
Excuse me!
- Yeah?

622
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:19,250
What do I tell Ronnie?

623
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:20,580
Priya.
- Priya.

624
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,880
Well..

625
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:25,710
You said he isn't..

626
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:44,460
I am so sorry about Nancy.

627
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:54,830
I can't believe Nancy is dead.

628
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,170
She was so excited.

629
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:59,920
She was supposed to come to
London and now she's no more.

630
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,580
She did not deserve this.

631
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:04,830
So young.

632
00:57:06,290 --> 00:57:07,500
So happy.

633
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:13,580
It doesn't make a difference
to anyone here.

634
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,830
This is just another case
for the cops.

635
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:20,170
But not for me.

636
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:24,880
I have to find out

637
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,170
who killed Nancy
so mercilessly.

638
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,460
Ronnie.

639
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:36,580
Please help me find that rascal.

640
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:40,750
Coffee.

641
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,920
He was inhumane.

642
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,830
He could've taken her
to the hospital.

643
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,580
The police said that
injury wasn't fatal.

644
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,830
Had she been taken to the
hospital, she could've survived.

645
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:57,080
Ronnie, only you can help me.

646
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,500
I want that creep behind bars.

647
00:58:01,170 --> 00:58:03,080
You're a well-known reporter.

648
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:06,290
You can write articles
and put pressure on the police!

649
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:08,460
You know,
maybe a single article

650
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,670
can help us find a witness.
You know?

651
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:13,710
Perhaps someone will
lead us to the car

652
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,460
or to the driver!

653
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,000
Give me something!
Anything, Ronnie! Anything!

654
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,000
What the heck can I do about it?

655
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,500
Am I the police or the lawyer?

656
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,170
Am I the witness? No, right?

657
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,380
Please, Priya.
Try to understand.

658
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:27,420
Please.

659
00:58:29,290 --> 00:58:31,540
The other day you didn't
even meet me at the graveyard.

660
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:36,290
I should've understood
where our relationship stands.

661
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:04,880
'When we met,
it was the trial of our love.'

662
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,750
'We parted ways.'

663
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:11,540
'Yet our destination
didn't change.'

664
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:15,580
'You were with me
on my excruciating journey'

665
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:18,460
'like my shadow.'

666
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:25,750
'You're the one who
encouraged me at every step.'

667
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:32,630
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

668
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:39,460
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

669
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,920
'Filled with sorrows.'

670
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,250
'My heart was filled
with sorrows.'

671
00:59:46,330 --> 00:59:52,960
'Without you, my heart
was filled with sorrows.'

672
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,790
Darn! Shucks!

673
01:00:59,290 --> 01:01:00,580
Oh, God!

674
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:19,170
You're implying

675
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:22,880
that someone fiddled
with your car brakes

676
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,790
which caused the accident.

677
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:27,500
And you still got away
without a scratch, huh!

678
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:31,080
We'll have to inspect the car.

679
01:01:31,750 --> 01:01:34,500
But I already sent the car
to the garage.

680
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,880
Very strange.

681
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:39,420
Three sugars please.

682
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:43,830
You sent your car
to the garage

683
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,670
without filing
a police complaint.

684
01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:48,380
Are you sure
this was an accident?

685
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,040
But this doesn't
look like an accident.

686
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:54,130
What do you mean?

687
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,880
Nancy was your sister, right?
- Yes.

688
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,130
Step-sister?

689
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,500
Yes.
- Thank you.

690
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,580
Welcome.

691
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,500
Beautiful house.

692
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:07,830
Whose house is it?

693
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,080
It was Nancy's
18th birthday gift.

694
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,960
From dad.
- When was her birthday?

695
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,290
Today.

696
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,330
And after Nancy?
- Mine.

697
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,460
I see.

698
01:02:19,790 --> 01:02:21,880
So this place is all yours
since last night.

699
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:26,460
What do you mean?
- I mean perhaps..

700
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:31,540
Nancy was murdered.
Somebody killed her.

701
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,670
I don't mean you. Not yet.

702
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,460
This is my number.

703
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,420
Call me if you have any
information about the case.

704
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:04,830
Are they investigating
Nancy's murder or me?

705
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:10,500
He's investigating you in
connection with Nancy's murder.

706
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:13,710
But why?

707
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,540
Because only you benefit
from Nancy's death.

708
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,040
That's why.

709
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:27,080
I am going back.

710
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,580
I can't handle all this.

711
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:37,960
But I thought
you wanted to come back.

712
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:39,380
Yeah, but..

713
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,210
Not like this.

714
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:46,580
I missed you every day
when we were apart.

715
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:49,000
And trust me. Every single day.

716
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:54,000
I was wrong to think

717
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,710
that I could be happy by staying
away from this place, from you.

718
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,000
But I was wrong.
- Now what?

719
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,710
It's not possible for me
to stay here any longer.

720
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:06,460
Why don't you come with me?

721
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:09,750
It's not that easy..

722
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:23,630
Nice drink. Is it new?
- Sort of.

723
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:24,630
Nice mix.

724
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:27,040
Old relations and a new drink.

725
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,250
Wow!

726
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:30,250
Wow!

727
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:33,290
Sorry for twice interfering
in your illogical lives

728
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,540
with my logical findings.

729
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,420
Excuse me.

730
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,380
According to forensic report

731
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:41,580
Nancy didn't die of
the accident.

732
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:47,540
She was strangled.
Nancy has been murdered.

733
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:51,630
What?

734
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:54,330
Ms. Priya, when did you
come in the city?

735
01:04:55,790 --> 01:04:59,130
You came here a day
before Nancy's death.

736
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:01,580
Not a day later.
Am I right or am I right?

737
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,080
Now this is an official
warning for you.

738
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,790
You cannot leave this city
without my permission.

739
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:15,330
Without my written permission.

740
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:16,630
Is that clear?

741
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:17,830
Another question.

742
01:05:18,460 --> 01:05:20,170
Who else did know

743
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,750
you came here a day
before Nancy's death?

744
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,830
I mean who else?

745
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:27,880
Ronnie?

746
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:32,040
And if Ronnie knew
then Praise the Lord!

747
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,130
I mean..

748
01:05:35,790 --> 01:05:37,630
This is going to be so much fun!

749
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,630
It will be so much fun!

750
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,580
It will be

751
01:05:50,790 --> 01:05:52,250
so much fun.

752
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:09,750
Maya.

753
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Maya..

754
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:18,420
I've been knocking
on your door for so long.

755
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,960
Why aren't you
answering the door?

756
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:22,960
Even your phone is switched off.

757
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:24,040
Maya.

758
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:25,380
Maya, you know what?

759
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:27,920
I met Inspector Moses today.

760
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,290
Forensic report says

761
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,040
that someone murdered Nancy.

762
01:06:34,790 --> 01:06:35,790
No.

763
01:06:36,210 --> 01:06:37,290
Not possible.

764
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,170
How is this possible?

765
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:41,880
Nancy had an accident.

766
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,750
We were there.

767
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,420
Moses is lying.
- I just don't get this!

768
01:06:48,500 --> 01:06:50,040
I am so confused.

769
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:55,380
Someone is trying to prove
the accident as a murder.

770
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:57,040
But why?

771
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:59,210
Why would anyone do it?
- Who is Priya?

772
01:06:59,290 --> 01:07:00,960
What?
- Who is Priya?

773
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:03,420
What does she mean to you?

774
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:06,210
What do you care?
- What's your relation with her?

775
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:07,790
Why do you meet her every day?

776
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:11,250
What I do and who I meet is
my personal business, okay?

777
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:14,130
It's not your personal business,
Mr. Rohan Achrekar.

778
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:15,880
Don't forget.

779
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,830
Even I am involved in everything
that's going on.

780
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:22,000
And Priya who you meet every day

781
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,460
is actually Nancy's sister.

782
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:25,960
It was Nancy

783
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,460
who died because you
rammed her with your car.

784
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:31,290
Because you were drunk.

785
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:36,000
And I..
I was with you. Understand?

786
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,540
You won't meet Priya again!
That's it.

787
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:41,170
I can't do that.
- Why?

788
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:43,170
Why can't you?

789
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:45,750
What does she mean to you?
- She's my ex-girlfriend.

790
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,580
I knew that witch will ruin you.

791
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,040
What did you say?
What did you call her?

792
01:07:53,130 --> 01:07:54,420
Come on, tell me!
What did you call her?

793
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:57,040
Your Priya! She is a witch!
- Maya!

794
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:07,080
Maya, I am so sorry.
- Don't touch me.

795
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:08,330
Maya, listen.

796
01:08:08,580 --> 01:08:10,330
Maya! Maya!

797
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:15,250
Mr. Achrekar,
why did Maya hate Priya?

798
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:18,080
Jealousy. Jealousy.

799
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:20,500
Jealousy.

800
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:31,830
'You are mine, just mine.'

801
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:46,960
'Wherever you go,
you just come to me.'

802
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:54,920
'I am a stone.'

803
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:05,380
'Come and break me
and turn me into a mirror.'

804
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:08,500
Hey buddy, your article
was sensational.

805
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:11,170
My newspaper sales have
gone up by 100 percent.

806
01:09:11,250 --> 01:09:12,960
Last year, it was the parents

807
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,670
and this year their daughter
died in an accident.

808
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:18,670
Nancy was still alive
after the accident.

809
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,750
She was murdered later.

810
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:23,500
Yes.

811
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,250
Right?
- Yes.

812
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:31,210
If the driver intended
to kill her..

813
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,330
He screwed up.

814
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,130
Or maybe someone
accidentally rammed into her..

815
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:40,540
And fled the scene
thinking she was dead.

816
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,540
The murderer took
advantage of the situation.

817
01:09:45,670 --> 01:09:46,960
You know what this means?

818
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:51,290
He climbed down the ditch and
he found that Nancy was alive.

819
01:09:51,380 --> 01:09:53,710
God darn it, Ronnie!
Do you know what you're saying?

820
01:09:54,210 --> 01:09:55,290
Of course.

821
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:56,920
Come, I'll show you.

822
01:09:59,170 --> 01:10:00,460
Nancy was supposed
to leave the bar

823
01:10:00,540 --> 01:10:03,130
and attend some guy's
surprise birthday party.

824
01:10:03,210 --> 01:10:05,170
Someone was supposed
to kill Nancy

825
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,960
between the bar and this party.

826
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,210
Maybe the boy himself.
Unfortunately

827
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:11,460
she met with an accident
on a one-way street.

828
01:10:12,130 --> 01:10:14,000
After the accident,
the driver fled the scene

829
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,630
and the murderer
strangled Nancy to death.

830
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:18,880
And of course,
this accident wasn't planned.

831
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,000
Nancy was supposed to
die that night.

832
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,040
Whether the accident
had taken place or not.

833
01:10:23,130 --> 01:10:25,000
This accident was incidental.

834
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:27,580
This accident..

835
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:31,080
Hang on!
Hang on, Ronnie. Hang on.

836
01:10:31,170 --> 01:10:34,630
Maybe this is just
a conspiracy theory.

837
01:10:35,380 --> 01:10:38,080
I mean, I think
it's a hypothesis.

838
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:39,830
Yes, it's a hypothesis.

839
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,290
Nonetheless any hypothesis

840
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:42,920
which has the potential
to be proved right

841
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:47,080
and anything that can be proved
makes a great story.

842
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,130
And we have a great story.

843
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:24,790
Hello.
- Maya.

844
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,420
I have some news for you.

845
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,670
Read tomorrow's headlines and
you'll understand everything.

846
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:33,380
Dinner tonight?

847
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,580
Why did you choose tonight?

848
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,500
Just..

849
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,670
You're lying, aren't you?

850
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:44,250
You know
Saturday is my birthday.

851
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,540
So come home,
I'll cook a nice meal for you.

852
01:11:50,170 --> 01:11:52,210
Of course, it is.
How could I forget?

853
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:53,920
I had a question.

854
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,290
Give me that fish.

855
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:58,960
Did you meet Priya again?

856
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:01,130
No.

857
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:05,000
I trust you.

858
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:06,880
Bye.

859
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,040
Bye.

860
01:12:08,380 --> 01:12:09,250
Yes!

861
01:13:15,710 --> 01:13:17,080
Your phone is ringing.

862
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:23,630
I was busy and the phone
was on silent mode.

863
01:13:24,250 --> 01:13:25,330
Anything urgent?

864
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:26,790
Moses called.

865
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,080
They've found a witness.

866
01:13:30,790 --> 01:13:32,420
I want you to come with me.

867
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:36,420
Please don't say no.
It means a lot to me.

868
01:13:57,250 --> 01:13:58,830
It was very dark.

869
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,920
It was also raining,
so I couldn't see much.

870
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,710
Did you see a car?
- Yes, sir, I saw a car.

871
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:08,880
It was at a distance.
- Which car?

872
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:13,710
It wasn't one of the regular
cars. It was big. A big car.

873
01:14:13,790 --> 01:14:17,130
How many people?
- Two people got down.

874
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:21,210
A male and a female.

875
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,420
Just like these two.

876
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,880
Just like these two.
- Are you sure?

877
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,830
Not sure, it's a hunch.

878
01:14:35,920 --> 01:14:38,000
The guy was carrying a torch.

879
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,330
First, he climbed down
and then climbed back up

880
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:43,500
and then he fled.

881
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,500
And the girl. Where was she?

882
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,250
Which girl?

883
01:14:49,330 --> 01:14:52,290
You said a guy and a girl
got down from the car.

884
01:14:52,380 --> 01:14:55,040
Where did the girl go?
- Where was the girl?

885
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,710
The girl..

886
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:00,960
Tell me.

887
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:03,330
The girl?

888
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:04,580
Speak up!

889
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:05,920
The girl..

890
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:10,170
Sir, I'll come back
as soon as I remember

891
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:12,250
where the girl was.
- Idiot.

892
01:15:12,330 --> 01:15:15,460
I'll come back when I remember
where the girl was. - Out!

893
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:22,040
Ms. Priya, I hope you remember.

894
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:25,130
I told you.
You can't leave the city.

895
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:28,630
I am not going anywhere
till Nancy gets justice.

896
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:41,710
I think it'll be better

897
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:45,880
if you stop suspecting Priya
and find the murderer.

898
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:58,250
Hello. - May I speak
to Rohan Achrekar?

899
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:01,960
Mr. Achrekar left with Priya
in the afternoon.

900
01:16:02,040 --> 01:16:03,040
Who is this?

901
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:05,580
Hello. Hello?

902
01:16:15,130 --> 01:16:16,540
Can you stay for a while?

903
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:19,630
I am a little scared.

904
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:24,540
Sorry!

905
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:39,000
Actually, I have dinner plans
with someone

906
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:40,250
so I'll be late.

907
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:43,500
I mean, I have to go.

908
01:16:44,830 --> 01:16:46,630
It's okay.
I understand.

909
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,130
Good night.

910
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,130
Yes, Maya.
- Hello.

911
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,250
Where are you?
- I am at the office.

912
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:18,500
I'm working on Nancy's story and
I have some more information.

913
01:17:18,580 --> 01:17:19,630
I'll be late.

914
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:24,040
I'm sorry, I can't delay this.

915
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:25,210
No problem.

916
01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:27,080
I'll wait.

917
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:29,920
No, no, no.
Actually, don't wait up.

918
01:17:31,290 --> 01:17:33,960
If it gets too late,
I'll sleep in the office.

919
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:35,790
I'll see you tomorrow.

920
01:17:36,710 --> 01:17:39,000
Hey, I am really sorry.

921
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:40,960
I'll make it up to you.

922
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:45,420
'I love you more than myself.'

923
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,710
'You're the one for me.'

924
01:17:50,580 --> 01:17:54,580
'The heart is obsessed'

925
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:59,000
'about making you mine.'

926
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:30,170
'You are mine, just mine.'

927
01:18:36,290 --> 01:18:44,290
'Wherever you go,
you just come to me.'

928
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,130
'I am a stone.'

929
01:18:54,330 --> 01:19:03,420
'Come and break me
and turn me into a mirror.'

930
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:05,000
You didn't go for your dinner.

931
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:10,130
How could I have gone
when you were scared?

932
01:19:11,540 --> 01:19:13,290
You know, I could
never leave you alone.

933
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,080
I missed you a lot.

934
01:19:16,830 --> 01:19:18,580
I missed you a lot, too.

935
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:19,830
You know what?
I knew you wouldn't leave.

936
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:25,330
You know what? No one knows me
better than anyone.

937
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:56,580
'I have found a reason
to live again.'

938
01:20:56,830 --> 01:21:03,380
'I found the shore when
I immersed myself in you.'

939
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:24,040
'I have found a reason
to live again.'

940
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:30,710
'I found life again.'

941
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:37,790
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

942
01:21:37,880 --> 01:21:44,330
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

943
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:48,040
'Filled with sorrows..'

944
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:51,460
'My heart was filled
with sorrows.'

945
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:58,250
'Without you, my heart
was filled with sorrows.'

946
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:29,250
'I have a secret
to share with you.'

947
01:22:29,540 --> 01:22:32,500
'Be my confidante.'

948
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,330
'I want to say
something to you.'

949
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:39,500
'Be my words.'

950
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:33,210
'I have a secret
to share with you.'

951
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:36,670
'Be my confidante.'

952
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:40,080
'I want to say
something to you.'

953
01:23:40,170 --> 01:23:42,750
'Be my words.'

954
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:45,170
'Since we parted ways'

955
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:49,670
'I stay silent without you.'

956
01:23:49,750 --> 01:23:51,960
'Come closer to me'

957
01:23:52,040 --> 01:23:56,960
'and be my voice.'

958
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:03,420
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

959
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:10,630
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

960
01:24:10,710 --> 01:24:14,040
'Filled with sorrows..'

961
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:17,420
'My heart was filled
with sorrows.'

962
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:24,380
'Without you, my heart
was filled with sorrows.'

963
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:02,000
Maya.

964
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,040
Maya!

965
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,630
Bobby.

966
01:25:30,630 --> 01:25:31,670
Here boy!

967
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:36,250
Bobby?

968
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:41,170
Where is he?

969
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:43,920
Bobby!

970
01:25:45,130 --> 01:25:46,210
Bobby!

971
01:25:57,290 --> 01:25:58,380
Bobby!

972
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:02,460
Bobby!

973
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:04,790
Bobby!

974
01:26:05,750 --> 01:26:06,750
Bobby!

975
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:08,880
Maya!

976
01:26:16,130 --> 01:26:17,130
Bobby!

977
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,170
Bobby!

978
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:32,960
Maya!

979
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:39,960
Maya!

980
01:26:48,580 --> 01:26:49,750
Maya!

981
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:53,130
Maya!

982
01:27:16,380 --> 01:27:19,790
I tried to save Bobby, but..

983
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:25,330
How did he get out of my room?

984
01:27:25,420 --> 01:27:29,710
I was inside
and I saw him playing outside.

985
01:27:29,790 --> 01:27:32,000
I dashed outside.

986
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,540
By the time I could save him

987
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:36,750
it was already too late.

988
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:49,790
What's happening with me?

989
01:27:53,630 --> 01:27:55,580
Someone is playing
games with me.

990
01:27:57,210 --> 01:27:59,750
Accident, Nancy's murder.

991
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:01,790
Priya's accident.

992
01:28:02,460 --> 01:28:03,460
And now..

993
01:28:04,290 --> 01:28:05,330
Bobby.

994
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,420
He was like a kid to me.

995
01:28:09,040 --> 01:28:10,170
He..

996
01:28:13,670 --> 01:28:14,830
Hold on.

997
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,830
Only you had the other key
to my room.

998
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:28,920
You're accusing me for all this?

999
01:28:30,330 --> 01:28:32,330
You think I did all of this?

1000
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:35,330
Was I driving your car?

1001
01:28:36,710 --> 01:28:38,210
Did I kill Nancy?

1002
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:42,040
Am I responsible
for Priya's accident?

1003
01:28:43,630 --> 01:28:45,420
And now you are accusing me of
killing Bobby?

1004
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:53,250
Maya!
Maya, listen to me.

1005
01:28:53,330 --> 01:28:55,080
Maya, open the god darn door!

1006
01:28:55,920 --> 01:28:56,920
Maya!

1007
01:28:57,250 --> 01:28:58,210
Maya..

1008
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:00,630
Maya!

1009
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:07,000
Maya, don't be stupid.

1010
01:29:10,790 --> 01:29:11,750
Maya!

1011
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:19,790
Maya!

1012
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,080
Maya, listen..

1013
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,000
Maya! What the heck
are you doing?

1014
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:26,540
What the heck are you doing?
- Leave me!

1015
01:29:26,630 --> 01:29:28,580
Give this to me.
- Leave me!

1016
01:29:28,670 --> 01:29:31,000
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

1017
01:29:31,080 --> 01:29:33,130
Are you?
- Yes, I am crazy!

1018
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,040
I am crazy about you!

1019
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:38,330
And I am in love!

1020
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,790
I love you!

1021
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,420
I can't even think
ill of you.

1022
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:48,040
Hurting you is
out of the question!

1023
01:29:48,130 --> 01:29:50,750
I love you, darn it!
- Oh my God, Maya!

1024
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:52,960
Oh, my God!

1025
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:57,460
Maya, I like you a lot. Really.

1026
01:29:57,880 --> 01:29:59,250
But love..

1027
01:29:59,630 --> 01:30:01,630
I never thought
about you like that.

1028
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:06,040
You're lying.

1029
01:30:06,420 --> 01:30:08,420
You also love me.
- Maya.

1030
01:30:08,500 --> 01:30:10,210
You're lying, right?

1031
01:30:10,290 --> 01:30:12,920
You knew me before
you even moved here.

1032
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,960
I saw my photographs
on your computer.

1033
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,330
What was that?

1034
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,170
You took me on a date.

1035
01:30:22,170 --> 01:30:23,420
What was that?

1036
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:24,460
You..

1037
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:27,830
You arranged for dinner
on my birthday.

1038
01:30:28,460 --> 01:30:29,540
Why?

1039
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,540
Why?

1040
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:35,330
Don't you love me?

1041
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:40,420
You just left a rose
in front of my door.

1042
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,380
Why?

1043
01:30:41,460 --> 01:30:43,670
Maya.. - Because you
love me, don't you?

1044
01:30:44,790 --> 01:30:46,290
You're lying to me.

1045
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:48,210
I love you.

1046
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:50,210
Listen to me, Maya.

1047
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,170
Maya..

1048
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,630
Wait..

1049
01:30:54,040 --> 01:30:56,250
I'll love you
for the rest of my life.

1050
01:30:56,330 --> 01:30:58,790
Maya, we got to sort this.

1051
01:31:01,380 --> 01:31:02,580
Listen to me, Maya.

1052
01:31:03,330 --> 01:31:04,960
I can't stay without you.

1053
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,040
I can't.. I love you.

1054
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:15,630
I love you.

1055
01:31:16,330 --> 01:31:17,540
I love you.

1056
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:19,540
Oh Maya!

1057
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:21,670
Maya, what have you done?

1058
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:23,500
I am okay.

1059
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:24,960
Give that to me.
- I'm okay.

1060
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:34,330
I'm okay.
- You..

1061
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:38,460
I love you..

1062
01:31:45,420 --> 01:31:49,750
For girls, it's all about
attraction, possession

1063
01:31:50,670 --> 01:31:51,920
jealousy

1064
01:31:52,630 --> 01:31:54,000
obsession.

1065
01:31:54,580 --> 01:31:56,960
This is obsessive.

1066
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,790
Obsession is a disease.

1067
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:06,290
Love is a disease.

1068
01:32:06,710 --> 01:32:07,830
There you go.

1069
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:10,630
Come on, man!

1070
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:22,210
Rohan, I can understand

1071
01:32:22,580 --> 01:32:26,960
why you didn't go to the police
after those incidents.

1072
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:33,040
But what I fail to understand

1073
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:36,670
why the police didn't
come looking for you

1074
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:42,290
after what took place.

1075
01:33:07,880 --> 01:33:09,000
Thank you.

1076
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:11,790
Your phone is switched off
since last evening.

1077
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:13,750
Your landline is
not working as well.

1078
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:16,330
Priya called me so that
she could contact you.

1079
01:33:17,500 --> 01:33:19,080
She came here last night
looking for you

1080
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:20,420
but the door was locked.

1081
01:33:23,330 --> 01:33:24,790
What kind of girl is Priya?

1082
01:33:26,130 --> 01:33:28,130
Why are you asking me
personal questions?

1083
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:29,630
If you don't mind
I would officially

1084
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:31,540
like to ask you some
personal questions.

1085
01:33:33,170 --> 01:33:35,040
How was the relation
between Nancy and Priya?

1086
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:38,130
They were step-sisters.
It was a love-hate relationship.

1087
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,040
And?

1088
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:45,250
And Nancy was 6
and Priya was 13

1089
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:48,130
when Nancy's mother and
Priya's father got married.

1090
01:33:48,210 --> 01:33:49,330
I see.

1091
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,000
And?

1092
01:33:51,830 --> 01:33:52,880
And what?

1093
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:57,170
Priya thought Nancy had
taken her place.

1094
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:02,250
Tell me. Could Priya and
Nancy have fought over money?

1095
01:34:02,330 --> 01:34:03,460
How would I know?

1096
01:34:03,540 --> 01:34:05,540
She's your girlfriend.
How could you not know?

1097
01:34:05,630 --> 01:34:07,330
Ex-girlfriend.
- Right.

1098
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:11,250
Last night you were at
your ex-girlfriend's house.

1099
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:13,330
Am I right?

1100
01:34:14,540 --> 01:34:16,580
Why did you call Nancy

1101
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:20,080
an hour before she was murdered?

1102
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:21,710
Do you remember?

1103
01:34:27,290 --> 01:34:29,330
You're right.
I gave her a missed call.

1104
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:30,710
Why?

1105
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:32,630
Obviously to exchange numbers.

1106
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:34,750
Where?
- Tony's Bar.

1107
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:36,500
Secrets!

1108
01:34:37,250 --> 01:34:40,460
I love secrets! Yes.

1109
01:34:40,540 --> 01:34:43,130
Why didn't you mention this in
any of your newspaper articles?

1110
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:47,960
Yes. Like how was her mood?
- It was normal.

1111
01:34:48,040 --> 01:34:49,540
Normal?
- Yes.

1112
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:51,420
Right.

1113
01:34:53,670 --> 01:34:56,040
Why didn't you tell
Priya about this?

1114
01:34:58,330 --> 01:34:59,380
What difference would it
have made?

1115
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:01,250
I am sure it will make
a difference to her.

1116
01:35:01,330 --> 01:35:03,500
If not you, it will definitely
make a difference to Priya.

1117
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:05,540
Think about it. Thank you.

1118
01:35:06,920 --> 01:35:08,040
Welcome.

1119
01:35:12,670 --> 01:35:14,960
By the way,
just for your information.

1120
01:35:15,670 --> 01:35:17,580
I'm giving you a headline
for tomorrow's edition.

1121
01:35:18,420 --> 01:35:22,420
'Inspector Moses solves
Nancy Murder case.'

1122
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:43,580
Here. It will help.
You will sleep better.

1123
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,330
Priya's responsible
for Nancy's accident.

1124
01:35:56,750 --> 01:36:00,790
Priya did this
with someone's help.

1125
01:36:02,750 --> 01:36:05,710
Because besides Priya
nobody benefits from her murder.

1126
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:10,960
It was supposed
to look like an accident.

1127
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,250
But she had a real accident.

1128
01:36:24,330 --> 01:36:27,130
Hey, Priya. How are you?

1129
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:31,290
We're really sorry
to hear about Nancy.

1130
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:39,330
Who was she here with?
- Her regular friends.

1131
01:36:40,330 --> 01:36:42,040
But she left alone.

1132
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:45,880
She danced with Ronnie
for a while.

1133
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:49,290
Ronnie?

1134
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,540
She came here with Ronnie?

1135
01:36:51,630 --> 01:36:54,080
Ronnie came here
with some other girl.

1136
01:36:54,170 --> 01:36:56,750
But he met Nancy here.

1137
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:09,170
Why didn't you tell me

1138
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:11,330
you met Nancy on
the night of the accident?

1139
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:13,880
You came here a day
before the accident.

1140
01:37:13,960 --> 01:37:16,130
Even you didn't tell me.
What's the difference?

1141
01:37:16,210 --> 01:37:19,460
The difference is that Nancy
was killed, Mr. Rohan Achrekar.

1142
01:37:19,540 --> 01:37:22,250
Don't you get it?
And I thought you loved me.

1143
01:37:23,960 --> 01:37:25,750
I still love you..
- Don't touch me!

1144
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:30,330
I'll find out who killed Nancy.

1145
01:37:32,580 --> 01:37:33,750
Screw you!

1146
01:38:26,540 --> 01:38:27,580
Maya!

1147
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:32,630
Maya! What happened?

1148
01:38:33,040 --> 01:38:34,710
Ronnie!

1149
01:38:46,460 --> 01:38:47,500
Are you telling me

1150
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,960
there was someone else
besides the two of you

1151
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:51,960
who knew about the accident?

1152
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:57,210
The license plate nailed
to the door was a warning?

1153
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:02,500
It's not only interesting,
but also exciting.

1154
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,790
And what about Priya?
Did she contact you?

1155
01:39:29,710 --> 01:39:30,710
Excuse me.

1156
01:39:32,250 --> 01:39:33,580
Hi.
- Hi, ma'am.

1157
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:36,040
How many ferries
ply on this route?

1158
01:39:36,630 --> 01:39:38,500
Just two and both are mine.

1159
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:42,500
Do you operate round the clock?
- No, madam.

1160
01:39:42,580 --> 01:39:46,880
We shut down at midnight,
and start again at 4 AM.

1161
01:39:47,170 --> 01:39:51,290
16th was a Saturday.
Were you here that day?

1162
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:54,710
Yes. I own this ferry.
I was right here.

1163
01:39:55,290 --> 01:39:57,960
Do you maintain a record
of all the vehicles?

1164
01:39:58,040 --> 01:39:59,540
No, madam. Why?

1165
01:39:59,630 --> 01:40:02,830
Madam, did you say 16th?
The night of the storm? - Yes.

1166
01:40:02,920 --> 01:40:04,790
That night we had to shut
our services at 8:30 PM.

1167
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:12,290
If the ferry service is closed

1168
01:40:12,380 --> 01:40:14,290
what's the alternate route?

1169
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:16,750
You drive via the old bridge
and it's dark out there.

1170
01:40:21,790 --> 01:40:23,630
Priya-Nancy.

1171
01:40:23,710 --> 01:40:25,960
Priya-Nancy. Priya-Nancy.

1172
01:40:26,040 --> 01:40:27,250
Okay. Fine.

1173
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:30,750
JD, repeat please.

1174
01:40:34,670 --> 01:40:35,830
Priya?

1175
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:37,460
Hello, Ms. Priya

1176
01:40:48,290 --> 01:40:49,880
Ronnie is not at home.

1177
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:59,580
Actually, I have the keys
to his house.

1178
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:01,710
You can check.

1179
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:09,830
Good! I came here to meet you.

1180
01:41:15,540 --> 01:41:16,960
I went to Tony's Bar.

1181
01:41:19,540 --> 01:41:22,670
This is Nancy, my sister,
she was there too.

1182
01:41:23,330 --> 01:41:24,580
You must have seen her.

1183
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:27,540
I don't remember.

1184
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:31,420
How did you two get back?
Ronnie and you?

1185
01:41:32,210 --> 01:41:34,960
We drove to the ferry
in Ronnie's car.

1186
01:41:35,040 --> 01:41:36,960
After that his car broke down.

1187
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:41,210
Before getting on the ferry
or after getting off?

1188
01:41:41,290 --> 01:41:42,880
After getting off the ferry.

1189
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:47,330
But Ronnie's complaint
states otherwise.

1190
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:50,380
It says his car broke down
before getting on to the ferry.

1191
01:41:52,630 --> 01:41:54,250
Why are you asking me?

1192
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,000
Because you are lying.
- Why would I lie?

1193
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,250
You and Ronnie caused
the accident, didn't you?

1194
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:02,210
Shut up!

1195
01:42:02,290 --> 01:42:04,460
You were in Ronnie's car,
weren't you?

1196
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:06,960
Have you lost your mind?
- You were drunk.

1197
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:09,040
I said no! - And then you fled
the scene as you were scared.

1198
01:42:09,130 --> 01:42:10,580
Just shut up, okay? No!

1199
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:13,250
You killed Nancy.
- You killed Nancy.

1200
01:42:13,330 --> 01:42:14,670
And you left her there to die.

1201
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:17,080
You killed your step-sister
for the property and money.

1202
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:19,830
You left my sister to die.
- No!

1203
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,380
Yes! You killed Nancy!
- No!

1204
01:42:21,460 --> 01:42:23,960
Yes! You killed Nancy.

1205
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:25,170
Leave me!

1206
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:36,580
I'll kill you.
- No!

1207
01:43:12,210 --> 01:43:13,960
Priya!

1208
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,380
Help! Help.

1209
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:53,580
What?

1210
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:38,540
Shucks.

1211
01:44:40,080 --> 01:44:41,170
Maya!

1212
01:44:44,330 --> 01:44:45,330
Sir..

1213
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:50,580
What's this?

1214
01:45:19,170 --> 01:45:20,290
Hello.

1215
01:45:21,290 --> 01:45:22,250
Hello.

1216
01:45:22,330 --> 01:45:25,130
It was raining heavily on the
night of the accident, right?

1217
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:27,540
Which night? What accident?

1218
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:30,750
The night Ronnie and you
went to Tony's Bar.

1219
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:32,080
That party!

1220
01:45:32,170 --> 01:45:34,580
That same night Nancy
met with an accident, right?

1221
01:45:34,670 --> 01:45:37,250
That night..

1222
01:45:37,830 --> 01:45:39,540
Oh, my God!

1223
01:45:40,710 --> 01:45:42,420
How can I forget that night?

1224
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:46,040
It was raining heavily,
just like this, you know?

1225
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:51,750
And Ronnie got me so drunk.

1226
01:45:51,830 --> 01:45:52,960
All I remember is

1227
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:54,540
that I got into his car
and fell asleep.

1228
01:45:54,630 --> 01:45:58,920
Then his car broke down
and Ronnie woke me up.

1229
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,290
I don't remember.

1230
01:46:01,210 --> 01:46:02,960
Actually, I have to go.

1231
01:46:03,580 --> 01:46:04,920
Where is Priya?

1232
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:11,330
What?

1233
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:13,290
Where is Priya?

1234
01:46:13,710 --> 01:46:15,420
Why are you asking me?

1235
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:16,960
Priya had called me.

1236
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:21,670
She knows who murdered Nancy.

1237
01:46:22,540 --> 01:46:24,080
She asked me to come here.

1238
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:29,790
Maybe. But I don't know.

1239
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:32,040
I was at the market.

1240
01:46:32,130 --> 01:46:33,920
But why is Priya's car
parked here?

1241
01:46:36,460 --> 01:46:37,630
I have to go.

1242
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:40,750
I'll see you later.

1243
01:46:40,830 --> 01:46:42,960
One second.
Let me just call Priya.

1244
01:48:42,790 --> 01:48:43,880
Nancy.

1245
01:48:45,130 --> 01:48:46,000
Bobby.

1246
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:51,630
Priya!

1247
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:53,250
No.

1248
01:49:10,250 --> 01:49:11,790
I knew it was you.

1249
01:49:11,880 --> 01:49:15,670
What.. What will
I tell my sister?

1250
01:49:17,580 --> 01:49:19,080
I love you.

1251
01:49:19,170 --> 01:49:21,040
I am crazy about you.

1252
01:49:26,920 --> 01:49:28,920
You're sick, Maya.

1253
01:49:29,290 --> 01:49:30,420
Oh really!

1254
01:49:31,540 --> 01:49:32,710
You think so?

1255
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:38,500
Your sister is dead.

1256
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:43,210
You.. You killed her.

1257
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:47,170
Why? Why?

1258
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,540
Yes, I killed my sister.

1259
01:49:54,380 --> 01:49:58,710
She would always snatch
everything I liked.

1260
01:49:59,330 --> 01:50:00,500
My toys.

1261
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:03,670
Clothes, everything.

1262
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:08,420
She even snatched the boy
I fell in love with.

1263
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,250
Had she been alive

1264
01:50:13,130 --> 01:50:15,000
she would've
snatched you too.

1265
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,630
It wasn't my fault

1266
01:50:18,670 --> 01:50:20,460
that she couldn't swim.

1267
01:50:22,630 --> 01:50:23,880
I killed her.

1268
01:50:24,830 --> 01:50:27,750
Is it my fault? Is it?

1269
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:30,290
No, right?

1270
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:31,670
You're sick.

1271
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:36,040
I killed Bobby.

1272
01:50:37,130 --> 01:50:39,750
And my child.. that alligator.

1273
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:41,960
I had to kill him, too.

1274
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:45,710
And Moses..

1275
01:50:45,790 --> 01:50:47,750
he was just going out
of control.

1276
01:50:47,830 --> 01:50:50,130
He made my life hell!

1277
01:50:50,630 --> 01:50:53,790
So I killed him!
I had to kill him.

1278
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:18,580
He was just going
out of control!

1279
01:51:18,670 --> 01:51:20,420
He suspected you.

1280
01:51:21,670 --> 01:51:24,580
So you killed Nancy.

1281
01:51:28,170 --> 01:51:29,540
You're missing her?

1282
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:39,830
Yes. I killed Nancy.

1283
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:42,250
Help me.

1284
01:51:43,420 --> 01:51:44,710
Did you think

1285
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:47,210
you could snatch
Ronnie from me?

1286
01:51:47,290 --> 01:51:49,960
Help me.

1287
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:52,080
Not that easy.

1288
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:53,540
Help me.

1289
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,710
Priya is still alive.

1290
01:52:13,830 --> 01:52:15,330
Would you like to see her?

1291
01:52:34,290 --> 01:52:36,500
I always had a dream

1292
01:52:36,580 --> 01:52:39,210
that we would get married

1293
01:52:39,290 --> 01:52:41,750
somewhere high up in the sky.

1294
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:47,000
Today is the day.
Don't open your eyes.

1295
01:52:51,130 --> 01:52:54,250
One, two, three.

1296
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:08,210
Welcome to Maya's kingdom!

1297
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:13,830
I've got a surprise for you.

1298
01:53:23,750 --> 01:53:24,790
Priya!

1299
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:26,960
Priya!

1300
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:29,080
I will save you.

1301
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:38,630
No! Priya!

1302
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:48,920
Sit.

1303
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,880
Well, well, well. Let me
get you something to drink.

1304
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:03,960
Read.

1305
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:09,380
This is Priya's
confession letter.

1306
01:54:09,460 --> 01:54:11,580
It says Priya killed Nancy.

1307
01:54:12,380 --> 01:54:14,380
After which she'd inherit
the entire property.

1308
01:54:14,460 --> 01:54:15,710
But she's committing
suicide now

1309
01:54:15,790 --> 01:54:17,080
and no one's responsible for it.

1310
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:18,580
Ronnie, you know what?

1311
01:54:20,130 --> 01:54:21,920
I love you so much.

1312
01:54:23,380 --> 01:54:25,040
That I can kill both of us.

1313
01:54:29,250 --> 01:54:31,580
I wanted you to love me.

1314
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:34,880
Maya. Maya.

1315
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:38,330
How can anyone love so much?

1316
01:54:39,000 --> 01:54:41,040
I don't want the police
to catch us now.

1317
01:54:42,920 --> 01:54:44,330
After Priya's confession..

1318
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:48,420
As long as we're together,
no one can catch us.

1319
01:54:50,290 --> 01:54:51,790
No one will come here either.

1320
01:54:57,040 --> 01:54:58,670
Make love to me, Ronnie.

1321
01:55:03,750 --> 01:55:05,080
Make love to me.

1322
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,710
I love the smoke smell.

1323
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,710
I love the way you smoke.

1324
01:55:47,460 --> 01:55:48,630
Priya, you're safe.

1325
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:52,290
Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!

1326
01:55:55,790 --> 01:55:57,250
Maya, no.

1327
01:55:58,920 --> 01:55:59,960
Priya!

1328
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:02,420
Leave it! Let her die.

1329
01:56:03,670 --> 01:56:05,000
Let her go.

1330
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:19,790
Maya. - I'll kill you,
I'll kill you, Priya.

1331
01:56:24,170 --> 01:56:25,250
Maya! Please.

1332
01:56:25,540 --> 01:56:27,670
No one can save her from me!

1333
01:56:27,750 --> 01:56:28,920
Not even you!

1334
01:56:29,380 --> 01:56:30,580
Priya!

1335
01:56:37,880 --> 01:56:39,710
Priya, he is mine!

1336
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:43,630
You're mine, okay?

1337
01:56:45,710 --> 01:56:47,080
You're mine!

1338
01:57:00,960 --> 01:57:02,380
I'll kill you, Priya.

1339
01:57:08,670 --> 01:57:11,380
Priya, give me your hand!

1340
01:57:18,790 --> 01:57:21,960
This time I promise,
I won't let you go.

1341
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:31,210
Priya!

1342
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,920
I love you so much!

1343
01:57:41,500 --> 01:57:42,790
Maya.

1344
01:57:44,380 --> 01:57:45,290
Maya!

1345
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:47,540
Remember I told you.

1346
01:57:48,920 --> 01:57:52,130
I end up losing
anyone I love.

1347
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:54,000
You've seen the real
strength of love.

1348
01:57:54,790 --> 01:57:56,630
Love doesn't mean snatching.

1349
01:57:56,710 --> 01:57:58,040
It means to give.

1350
01:57:59,580 --> 01:58:00,790
To sacrifice.

1351
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:02,960
Come on!

1352
01:58:03,670 --> 01:58:04,580
Give me your hand, Maya.

1353
01:58:04,670 --> 01:58:06,080
Come on!
- Maya, give him your hand.

1354
01:58:06,170 --> 01:58:10,580
Is that what you want?
For the sake of my love?

1355
01:58:10,670 --> 01:58:13,710
Maya, give us your hand.
- Give me your hand, Maya.

1356
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,250
Come on.

1357
01:58:18,250 --> 01:58:19,540
Give me your hand.

1358
01:58:24,460 --> 01:58:25,830
Maya!
- Maya!

1359
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:28,630
'I am a stone.'

1360
01:58:29,630 --> 01:58:38,920
'Come and break me
and turn me into a mirror.'

1361
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:47,040
Rohan, you were
a successful crime reporter.

1362
01:58:47,130 --> 01:58:49,130
You got involved
with an obsessed girl.

1363
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:55,920
Well, if everything
you said corroborates

1364
01:58:56,630 --> 01:58:58,000
then there is no problem.

1365
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:03,750
Karan, we'll have to file
a charge sheet of this accident.

1366
01:59:04,460 --> 01:59:07,130
I made a mistake.
I should be punished for it.

1367
01:59:09,500 --> 01:59:10,540
I understand.

1368
01:59:13,500 --> 01:59:15,170
Go home and rest.

1369
01:59:15,630 --> 01:59:17,380
Come to the police station
tomorrow morning.

1370
01:59:17,750 --> 01:59:19,250
I will make sure you get bail.

1371
01:59:19,830 --> 01:59:21,000
Thanks.

1372
01:59:24,750 --> 01:59:25,880
Thanks, mate.

1373
01:59:32,170 --> 01:59:34,920
Officer, I'll speak
to the Home Minister

1374
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,670
and stop your transfer.

1375
01:59:37,880 --> 01:59:39,500
If I don't get transferred

1376
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:43,630
Ronnie will have nothing
to worry for five years.

1377
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:45,420
Thank you so much!

1378
02:00:11,670 --> 02:00:12,830
Ronnie.

1379
02:00:12,920 --> 02:00:14,170
Oh shucks!

1380
02:00:15,170 --> 02:00:16,380
I think someone's fallen down.

1381
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:20,500
I'll go take a look. Wait here!
Okay?

1382
02:00:22,330 --> 02:00:24,630
Hello, Priya. I rammed her
like we had planned.

1383
02:00:25,710 --> 02:00:27,080
Is she dead?
- Ronnie?

1384
02:00:27,170 --> 02:00:29,250
No.
- This is our chance, Ronnie.

1385
02:00:29,330 --> 02:00:33,290
If Nancy dies,
that property will be ours.

1386
02:00:35,880 --> 02:00:39,790
Die! Die, Nancy! Die!

1387
02:00:43,210 --> 02:00:45,830
Did you call the police?
- Have you lost your mind?

1388
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,670
You're drunk! I'm drunk.
It's our secret, okay?

1389
02:00:48,750 --> 02:00:50,830
We can't go to the police.
Get in right now!

1390
02:00:50,920 --> 02:00:51,960
Right now!

1391
02:00:56,290 --> 02:00:59,210
We'll have to do
something about Moses.

1392
02:00:59,290 --> 02:01:01,460
I've found a solution for that,
so don't worry.

1393
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:15,420
I know you've learnt the truth.

1394
02:01:15,500 --> 02:01:17,580
This says you murdered Nancy.

1395
02:01:17,670 --> 02:01:19,040
So you're committing suicide.

1396
02:01:19,130 --> 02:01:20,540
I promise you.

1397
02:01:20,630 --> 02:01:23,750
As long as your father lives,
I will look after him.

1398
02:01:23,830 --> 02:01:24,920
Sign it.

1399
02:01:28,290 --> 02:01:30,000
Let me go.
I won't tell anyone about it.

1400
02:01:30,080 --> 02:01:31,500
I love you!

1401
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,290
I love you!

1402
02:01:38,830 --> 02:01:40,040
I love you, Maya!

1403
02:01:42,920 --> 02:01:45,580
Grandma's stories.
Stories from our school days.

1404
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:47,710
Childhood stories,
teenage stories.

1405
02:01:47,790 --> 02:01:50,710
Real stories, fake stories.
We all love stories.

1406
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:56,540
You know, if you can tell
a fake story convincingly

1407
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:59,630
it sounds so true.

1408
02:02:00,040 --> 02:02:01,080
Right?

1409
02:02:35,500 --> 02:02:42,500
'I have found a reason
to live again.'

1410
02:02:42,880 --> 02:02:49,830
'I found the shore when
I immersed myself in you.'

1411
02:03:10,750 --> 02:03:17,670
'I have found a reason
to live again.'

1412
02:03:17,750 --> 02:03:24,630
'I found life again.'

1413
02:03:25,080 --> 02:03:32,420
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

1414
02:03:32,500 --> 02:03:39,420
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

1415
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:43,500
'Filled with sorrows..'

1416
02:03:43,580 --> 02:03:46,920
'My heart was
filled with sorrows.'

1417
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:55,000
'Without you, my heart
was filled with sorrows.'

1418
02:04:05,880 --> 02:04:09,630
'Comfort me.'

1419
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:12,790
'I've been tired for ages.'

1420
02:04:13,330 --> 02:04:16,920
'I've spent sleepless nights'

1421
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:19,920
'only for you.'

1422
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:27,330
'You can feel
the depth of my pain.'

1423
02:04:27,420 --> 02:04:35,290
'I can see sorrows
in your eyes.'

1424
02:04:35,380 --> 02:04:42,420
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

1425
02:04:42,670 --> 02:04:49,830
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

1426
02:05:12,290 --> 02:05:16,000
'I have a secret
to share with you.'

1427
02:05:16,080 --> 02:05:19,290
'Be my confidante.'

1428
02:05:19,670 --> 02:05:22,960
'I want to say
something to you.'

1429
02:05:23,460 --> 02:05:26,330
'Be my words.'

1430
02:05:26,420 --> 02:05:28,830
'Since we parted ways'

1431
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:33,710
'I stay silent without you.'

1432
02:05:33,790 --> 02:05:36,170
'Come closer to me'

1433
02:05:36,250 --> 02:05:41,330
'and be my voice.'

1434
02:05:41,710 --> 02:05:48,880
'When we met,
God blessed me with His grace.'

1435
02:05:48,960 --> 02:05:52,540
'Filled with sorrows..'

1436
02:05:52,630 --> 02:05:56,290
'My heart was
filled with sorrows.'

1437
02:05:56,380 --> 02:06:04,130
'Without you, my heart
was filled with sorrows.'
