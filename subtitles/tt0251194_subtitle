1
00:00:53,943 --> 00:00:55,665
'Nature created the world.'

2
00:00:56,074 --> 00:01:00,334
'It entertained the
world by music of streams.'

3
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,810
'The streams mirrored the sky.'

4
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:06,541
'The land was dressed
with velvet-like green grass.'

5
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:08,906
'He made flowers for fragrance.'

6
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:13,341
'He dipped flowers in the rainbow
and give flowers beautiful colors.'

7
00:01:13,802 --> 00:01:16,619
'And dressed up the
world like a bride.'

8
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:20,168
'Then he sowed friendship's
seed in humanity.'

9
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:24,661
'These are the characters of this
story of friendship, 'Greatness'.'

10
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:28,725
'Raj Malhotra and Vijay Kapoor.'

11
00:01:45,036 --> 00:01:49,119
"Without you what am I?
What am I without you?"

12
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:57,849
"Without you what am I?
What am I without you?"

13
00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:02,032
"I won't see the day
when I don't meet you!"

14
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:18,110
"Childhood is over,
youth has arrived."

15
00:04:22,232 --> 00:04:26,511
"Childhood is over,
youth has arrived."

16
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:30,894
"We both share the same story."

17
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:35,068
"We both share the same story."

18
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:42,727
- "I'm your image.
- You're my image."

19
00:04:42,807 --> 00:04:47,101
- "I'm your image.
- You're my image."

20
00:04:53,547 --> 00:04:57,809
- "Without you what am I?
- What am I without you?"

21
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,847
"I won't see the day
when I don't meet you!"

22
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:21,679
Uncle, when did you come?

23
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,640
If you had informed me, I could've
come to what could you've done?

24
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,568
Hoisted flags in my honor?
Or welcomed me with drums?

25
00:05:29,491 --> 00:05:33,720
What's this, the result
of my hard work and desires?

26
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,525
You thought you'll wear this uniform,
put two stars and life's made?

27
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:40,949
What else can you
think about besides this?

28
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,399
Because all your thoughts,
desires and joys..

29
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,766
..revolve around Raj Malhotra.

30
00:05:47,846 --> 00:05:51,316
You can't see anything
other than Raj Malhotra.

31
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:54,860
Stupid, why don't you realize that..

32
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,121
..friendship and your future
are two different things?

33
00:06:00,851 --> 00:06:02,214
I got your transfer
so you'd progress..

34
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:04,791
..and more doors
to success open for you.

35
00:06:04,871 --> 00:06:08,921
But no, you valued
friendship more than success.

36
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:14,452
And so easily, by writing this letter,
you destroyed all my hopes.

37
00:06:14,724 --> 00:06:17,898
Great, son!
In my career of so many years..

38
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,018
..this is the biggest award
of my life!

39
00:06:20,098 --> 00:06:22,164
Thank you very much, my son.

40
00:06:22,244 --> 00:06:25,879
Uncle! Listen to me, uncle..

41
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:35,669
What happened? Uncle left?

42
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:37,947
Yes.

43
00:06:38,807 --> 00:06:40,225
Then why didn't you stop him?

44
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:44,337
I tried a lot.
What can I do if he didn't stop?

45
00:06:44,712 --> 00:06:48,373
He thinks I'm a puppet
to dance to his tunes.

46
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:50,667
Why will he make you dance?

47
00:06:50,954 --> 00:06:55,024
He gave you a job,
education, for what, for himself?

48
00:06:55,695 --> 00:06:58,982
I said I don't want to go from here,
that's it.

49
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,582
Say that you don't want
to go away from Raj brother.

50
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:06,625
Okay think what you like,
I can leave my job, not my friendship.

51
00:07:09,321 --> 00:07:12,373
I know, even Raj brother
can't stay without you.

52
00:07:13,903 --> 00:07:17,876
But you know Raj brother very well.
He's very open hearted.

53
00:07:18,547 --> 00:07:21,738
He can endure anything
for your success and progress.

54
00:07:23,322 --> 00:07:27,722
If you want to see him happy,
you'll do only what's good for you.

55
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:33,837
'Forgive me, Raj.'

56
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:37,314
(Horn blares)

57
00:07:37,981 --> 00:07:43,090
'With a heavy heart,
Vijay Kapoor left that city..'

58
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,785
'..and left on the journey
that was his ancestors' dream.'

59
00:07:48,105 --> 00:07:53,035
'He just went on wandering
from one city to another.'

60
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:57,155
'Even Raj Malhotra left
that place and came to Bombay.'

61
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:03,990
'This place which is
called the city of Kedarnath.'

62
00:08:04,757 --> 00:08:08,671
'It's the part of Kedar
Shipping Corporation's splendour.'

63
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:14,771
'Kedarnath is still a real king
and all this is his kingdom.'

64
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:17,815
'Raj Malhotra became
a manager over here.'

65
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:20,695
'His employer is very wealthy.'

66
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:24,186
'People call him the
uncrowned king of the sea!'

67
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:27,759
'Every person in his
kingdom does only one thing.'

68
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:29,661
'He sings his king's praises.'

69
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:31,905
He made me a supervisor from a worker.

70
00:08:31,985 --> 00:08:34,270
- Yes.
- He educated my daughter..

71
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,272
..even promised her a job.

72
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:40,190
Anyway, for me Kedarnath..

73
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,145
- ..is a father and mother.
- Yes.

74
00:08:42,225 --> 00:08:45,866
My employer and even
my god is Kedarnath.

75
00:08:45,946 --> 00:08:50,499
Kedarnath!
I'm fed up of hearing this name!

76
00:08:51,721 --> 00:08:53,434
It's the truth, Shanti.

77
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:57,461
Kedarnath patronizes orphanages.

78
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,909
He helps widows.
He even gets poor girls married.

79
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:04,322
And the biggest proof is me,
sitting in front of you.

80
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:08,080
What was I before working
in the Kedar Shipping Corporation?

81
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,109
Today all there is in
this house is due to him.

82
00:09:11,189 --> 00:09:14,887
Okay, I agree.
Your boss is a nice man. Okay?

83
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:16,570
- What?
- Yes, sir.

84
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,642
Kedarnath is the
real pawn in this game.

85
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:19,494
And the goods?

86
00:09:19,574 --> 00:09:21,672
Ujagar has come to
take the goods, sir.

87
00:09:23,561 --> 00:09:24,785
Where are the goods?

88
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,516
They're are being
loaded in the car, sir.

89
00:09:26,855 --> 00:09:31,247
Excellent, Kelkar.
Is there any way to identify the car?

90
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:58,961
(Tires squealing)

91
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:00,180
Follow him!

92
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,529
(Tires squealing)

93
00:10:14,876 --> 00:10:16,017
(Tires squealing)

94
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,609
(Gunshot)

95
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:36,421
(Gunshot)

96
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,983
(Tires squealing)

97
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:48,583
(Gunshot)

98
00:10:52,075 --> 00:10:53,091
(Gunshot)

99
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,746
(Gunshot)

100
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:00,335
(Gunshot)

101
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:07,588
(Brakes squeal)

102
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:14,743
(Gunshot)

103
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:26,121
(Grunts)

104
00:11:49,754 --> 00:11:52,651
(Police siren wails)

105
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,662
(Brakes squeal)

106
00:11:58,949 --> 00:12:00,581
Kedar, sir!

107
00:12:02,073 --> 00:12:04,246
Kedar, sir!

108
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:08,921
Kedar, sir!

109
00:12:09,835 --> 00:12:12,035
Impostor, where are you?

110
00:12:16,798 --> 00:12:21,450
Idol of virtue, come before me!

111
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,503
Halt.

112
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,674
You've worn government uniform..

113
00:13:04,427 --> 00:13:08,536
..but you forgot your etiquette
and manners, inspector.

114
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,354
You applied sandalwood
on your forehead..

115
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,900
..but forgot wipe the stigma
of ill-gotten wealth, Kedar!

116
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:18,689
Don't try to shoot in the dark,
inspector.

117
00:13:18,851 --> 00:13:22,901
I have evidence and
witnesses against you.

118
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:27,840
Ujagar has told me everything.

119
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,783
(Chuckles)

120
00:13:29,184 --> 00:13:33,889
Inspector,
think of this very carefully.

121
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:39,053
Can you see this fish tank?

122
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:43,931
All these fishes are from the sea.

123
00:13:44,267 --> 00:13:49,206
But they're in a small fish
tank to beautify our drawing room.

124
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:54,250
This is not their helplessness,
but their way of thinking.

125
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,935
They think this small tank is a sea.

126
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:00,952
I presume you can't understand me.

127
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:04,232
Look!

128
00:14:06,392 --> 00:14:10,686
A small victory isn't
the last step of success.

129
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:15,250
You're standing at one end
and looking at the other.

130
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:20,981
But you forget that success
and the sea don't have an end.

131
00:14:21,978 --> 00:14:26,822
(Laughs) But you are fortunate..

132
00:14:27,508 --> 00:14:32,401
..that the goddess of wealth
has opened doors for you.

133
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:34,021
Kedarnath!

134
00:14:34,767 --> 00:14:38,603
I neither worship the goddess
nor are you a saint.

135
00:14:39,892 --> 00:14:43,533
You're the villain whose kingdom..

136
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:46,979
..will be burnt by
inspector Sher Khan.

137
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:52,012
By glaring at me you've
over risked your neck, novice!

138
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:56,961
You haven't noticed the
color of this novice's uniform.

139
00:14:57,749 --> 00:15:02,576
This is the khaki color
and those who wear it..

140
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:07,609
..either die themselves
or kill others!

141
00:15:09,054 --> 00:15:14,533
Anyway Kedar,
if I want I can arrest you right now.

142
00:15:15,761 --> 00:15:21,134
But I've come to warn you that
tomorrow when I drag you to court..

143
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:26,141
..you'll know how helpless you are!

144
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:31,555
And yes..

145
00:15:33,816 --> 00:15:36,914
..keep this stop watch with you, Kedar.

146
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,163
So that every passing
moment will remind you..

147
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:43,673
..how little time you have.

148
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:45,709
(Stopwatch starts)

149
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:46,848
Bye.

150
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:51,232
(Clock ticking)

151
00:15:51,312 --> 00:15:56,555
Foolish man! Left his watch with me.

152
00:15:58,233 --> 00:16:02,931
If he had taken it he could've
at least count his last moments.

153
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,618
- Peter.
- Yes, sir.

154
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:12,119
- What did you say his name was?
- Nanubhai Chhatewala.

155
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:19,355
Nanubhai Chhatewala.

156
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:53,069
What's it, sir?

157
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:57,505
You called me to the Gateway of India,
for a morning boat ride?

158
00:16:58,546 --> 00:17:01,144
Our principles differ Nanubhai.

159
00:17:02,013 --> 00:17:05,187
I don't do business
at a street corner.

160
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:08,165
I comfortably sit, face to face.

161
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:10,754
Now I understood, sir..

162
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:14,339
..why people call you
the king of the sea.

163
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,057
- Come on let's talk business, sir.
- You're a clever person.

164
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:22,362
If I weren't, I'd not be in
the contract killing business, sir.

165
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,351
Contract?

166
00:17:23,431 --> 00:17:27,684
Unlike betel nut
eaten with betel leaf..

167
00:17:27,764 --> 00:17:32,449
..ours is an advance for
advancing someone's death.

168
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,764
What's the guarantee?

169
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:38,459
In murder market Nanubhai's
name's the guarantee, sir.

170
00:17:39,513 --> 00:17:40,523
(Chuckles)

171
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:44,601
Will you hunt a lion?

172
00:17:46,415 --> 00:17:47,404
A lion?

173
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:51,008
A lion of the jungle of law.
A police inspector.

174
00:17:51,589 --> 00:17:53,687
Is he an ass or stupid?

175
00:17:54,404 --> 00:17:56,252
As clever as a fox!

176
00:17:56,332 --> 00:17:58,232
He couldn't digest the bone?

177
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,802
- Or you haven't offered it as yet?
- He doesn't want the bone.

178
00:18:02,501 --> 00:18:05,045
He bites the hand of
those who offer the bone.

179
00:18:05,849 --> 00:18:08,969
- How many stars does he have?
- He has three stars.

180
00:18:09,827 --> 00:18:13,414
Nanu takes 100,000 for one star.

181
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:16,149
- For three?
- 300,000.

182
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:17,957
- Yes.
- Okay.

183
00:18:18,707 --> 00:18:20,065
Here's the advance.

184
00:18:20,968 --> 00:18:22,435
Nanubhai..

185
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:26,837
..this is not to be eaten.

186
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,750
This is an advance given by Kedar.

187
00:18:31,598 --> 00:18:35,805
If you fail, it can harm you!

188
00:18:38,989 --> 00:18:41,750
- The inspector's station?
- Dongri.

189
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,424
- Name?
- Aslam Sher Khan.

190
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:44,406
(Police siren wails)

191
00:19:45,303 --> 00:19:46,846
(Brakes squeal)

192
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:54,013
Get back! Back!
Get back!

193
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,913
Back..

194
00:20:01,874 --> 00:20:03,495
He was honest.

195
00:20:06,752 --> 00:20:07,890
He's dead.

196
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,900
He talked too much
in front of Kedarnath.

197
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:13,539
Maybe he wasn't warned that even..

198
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:18,456
..his dogs think
twice before barking..

199
00:20:18,536 --> 00:20:19,762
..in front of Kedarnath.

200
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:23,987
For not thinking he's out of the way!

201
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,614
You closed his file!

202
00:20:26,694 --> 00:20:28,831
If you say I'll get it opened, Dube.

203
00:20:32,508 --> 00:20:35,227
Come Nanubhai.

204
00:20:36,011 --> 00:20:36,820
Sit.

205
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,700
Wow!

206
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:42,444
You're amazing!

207
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,694
You open the umbrella at times
or you open the account.

208
00:20:45,774 --> 00:20:47,293
Sometimes you open the..

209
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:49,988
Now you silently opened the door!

210
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:53,780
If I had made a noise,
wouldn't the bird have flown?

211
00:20:54,328 --> 00:20:58,279
- Sir, is my installment ready?
- Yes.

212
00:20:59,063 --> 00:21:00,410
Peter.

213
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,935
Sir, when you need
my services let me know.

214
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:06,127
Of course.

215
00:21:08,278 --> 00:21:11,957
- I'll take your leave.
- Nanu, you didn't count the money.

216
00:21:12,357 --> 00:21:13,870
What if it's less?

217
00:21:15,122 --> 00:21:17,209
Then it's the giver's bad luck.

218
00:21:17,723 --> 00:21:22,438
Nanu will shorten the days
of his life proportionately.

219
00:21:22,518 --> 00:21:23,363
(Hiccups)

220
00:21:25,139 --> 00:21:26,948
- Bye, sir.
- Nanu..

221
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:32,063
..better knock before entering,
next time.

222
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:44,008
It's not his fault, sir.

223
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:46,670
Actually he hasn't heard it said..

224
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:50,939
..that sitting on top doesn't
make a crow an eagle.

225
00:21:52,465 --> 00:21:55,269
I forgot what I came here for, sir.

226
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:56,456
What's it?

227
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:59,720
This Khan case has caused trouble.

228
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,956
Trouble?

229
00:22:01,036 --> 00:22:04,944
Our commissioner is being transferred
and new one's replacing him.

230
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:08,912
If he does, I may lose my uniform.

231
00:22:09,114 --> 00:22:12,499
Even the big shots will be shaken!

232
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:16,291
- What's his name?
- Commissioner Vijay Kapoor.

233
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:18,792
IG, sir!

234
00:22:19,563 --> 00:22:22,042
We just heard that
in today's race practice..

235
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:23,890
..commissioner Vijay Kapoor
will be shot!

236
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,299
- What?
- Yes, sir.

237
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:28,328
Please inform Vijay Kapoor
at once and stop that race!

238
00:22:40,973 --> 00:22:45,456
- Sir, it has already started.
- If it has then stop the killer!

239
00:24:54,427 --> 00:24:55,797
(Gunshot)

240
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,958
(Screams)

241
00:25:00,186 --> 00:25:01,466
(Horse neighing)

242
00:25:24,784 --> 00:25:26,202
Like him.

243
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:28,760
You may like this watch.

244
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,201
- Which one?
- This.

245
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:45,116
Show me a nice gents' watch.

246
00:26:45,196 --> 00:26:46,766
For whom is the watch?

247
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:50,170
I haven't seen him as yet.

248
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,831
But you must have some
idea of how he looks.

249
00:27:04,475 --> 00:27:06,508
Little like him.

250
00:27:07,866 --> 00:27:09,703
Somewhat like him.

251
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:12,194
Then you'll like this watch.

252
00:27:12,274 --> 00:27:14,148
- Which?
- This one.

253
00:27:42,463 --> 00:27:47,272
(Music)

254
00:28:19,527 --> 00:28:23,242
"The police inspector has come."

255
00:28:23,322 --> 00:28:27,322
"Let us garland him with flowers!"

256
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:30,046
Shanti.

257
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:32,598
- Sanju has come!
- Sanju!

258
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:59,441
"I stayed away for so many days."

259
00:28:59,521 --> 00:29:05,671
"I was unable to meet you."

260
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:09,688
"I stayed away for so many days."

261
00:29:09,768 --> 00:29:13,733
"I stayed away for so many days."

262
00:29:13,813 --> 00:29:17,583
"My heart was full of sadness."

263
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:28,795
"Sister-in-law, when I missed you,
a dagger pierced my heart!"

264
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:40,016
"Sister-in-law, when I missed you,
a dagger pierced my heart!"

265
00:29:40,096 --> 00:29:43,731
"The police inspector has come."

266
00:29:43,811 --> 00:29:47,721
"Let us garland him with flowers!"

267
00:29:48,109 --> 00:29:54,025
(Music)

268
00:30:28,323 --> 00:30:35,847
"What should I call you,
brother or an inspector?"

269
00:30:35,927 --> 00:30:43,406
"What should I call you,
brother or an inspector?"

270
00:30:43,486 --> 00:30:47,394
"Call me anything, but love me!"

271
00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:54,443
"We've met after so long."

272
00:30:54,523 --> 00:30:58,535
"It felt great after seeing you all!"

273
00:30:58,615 --> 00:31:05,736
"We've met after so long."

274
00:31:05,816 --> 00:31:09,319
"It felt great after seeing you all!"

275
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:16,896
"My friends, you all change too."

276
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:20,311
"The whole world has changed."

277
00:31:20,391 --> 00:31:27,865
"Those who didn't
change were left behind."

278
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:31,449
"The world moved ahead!"

279
00:31:31,529 --> 00:31:35,064
"The world moved ahead!"

280
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:38,809
"The world moved ahead!"

281
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,778
This sari is for sister-in-law.

282
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:50,316
It looks expensive. What was
the need for such an expensive sari?

283
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:53,970
Sister-in-law, for the first
time I've brought something for you.

284
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,772
- I think you didn't like it.
- Like?

285
00:31:58,477 --> 00:32:02,119
I'll save it only for
some special occasion.

286
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:03,662
(Horn blares)

287
00:32:09,926 --> 00:32:12,143
I had to do something
for a living, friend.

288
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,256
Destiny didn't favor me or else
I'd leave everyone behind. (Snaps finger)

289
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:19,804
Yes, destiny really
wasn't in your favor.

290
00:32:20,722 --> 00:32:23,815
He gave you the face of
one actor and the voice of ten.

291
00:32:23,895 --> 00:32:25,227
(Laughs)

292
00:32:25,412 --> 00:32:27,017
But watch, pal..

293
00:32:27,097 --> 00:32:30,046
- ..my talent will be noticed one day.
- Yes.

294
00:32:30,126 --> 00:32:35,889
Okay, now let me run the shop
while you watch this beauty's photo.

295
00:32:36,075 --> 00:32:41,136
Friend, this beauty
is nothing compared to..

296
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:44,367
..the beauty I've seen.

297
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,606
- Papa!
- Yes!

298
00:33:27,351 --> 00:33:29,173
Jenny daughter!

299
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:31,858
- My dear!
- Papa!

300
00:33:33,536 --> 00:33:37,164
What's this? No telegram, no letter.
You didn't even inform me!

301
00:33:37,244 --> 00:33:39,939
- I won't talk to you. I'm angry.
- O papa!

302
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:42,200
I thought I'll surprise you!

303
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,723
But you got angry.

304
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:46,729
It's okay.
I'll calm you down right away.

305
00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:47,709
Sit.

306
00:33:57,567 --> 00:34:01,316
Wow, such a nice watch! For me?

307
00:34:01,396 --> 00:34:04,679
- Papa, this isn't for you.
- Then?

308
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:08,438
This is for your son who
was with you through highs and lows.

309
00:34:08,968 --> 00:34:11,555
And won't I care for
the one who cares for you?

310
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,442
Dear, you still remember that boy?

311
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:19,005
Papa, parents tell kids
fairy tales to make them sleep.

312
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:23,404
Whenever you've told me a story,
it has been about Sanju.

313
00:34:23,484 --> 00:34:25,454
So how can I forget him, right?

314
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:30,114
But what're you thinking of?

315
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:34,225
I'm thinking..

316
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:40,725
..my daughter grew up so soon,
I didn't even realize it!

317
00:34:42,031 --> 00:34:45,161
Papa, you give this watch to him.

318
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:46,650
Give it yourself.

319
00:34:47,981 --> 00:34:50,367
But will you recognize him?

320
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,387
I'll try.

321
00:35:06,711 --> 00:35:08,925
(Panting)

322
00:35:11,202 --> 00:35:12,881
Who amongst you all is Sanju?

323
00:35:12,961 --> 00:35:14,624
- Sanju?
- Sanju?

324
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:45,775
I'm Sanju.

325
00:35:57,126 --> 00:35:59,172
This watch is for you.

326
00:36:02,511 --> 00:36:03,721
For me?

327
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:12,639
She is your uncle Pinto's daughter.

328
00:36:14,441 --> 00:36:16,081
Uncle Pinto's daughter?

329
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:27,565
(Brakes squeal)

330
00:36:29,704 --> 00:36:30,840
Can't you see?

331
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:34,341
'Maheshnath..

332
00:36:35,451 --> 00:36:38,450
..you're dead!'

333
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,651
(Whistling)

334
00:36:58,731 --> 00:36:59,939
Mahesh?

335
00:37:00,141 --> 00:37:01,279
Hi, dad.

336
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,811
What's it, son? You seem very happy!

337
00:37:04,891 --> 00:37:08,919
Yes, dad. Your son Maheshnath
is in a terrific mood today!

338
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:10,241
I'm really very happy today!

339
00:37:10,971 --> 00:37:13,988
Today I'm the richest
man in the world!

340
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:16,975
Which lottery has my son won?

341
00:37:17,055 --> 00:37:20,057
Not lottery, dad, I've got a girl.

342
00:37:20,137 --> 00:37:21,504
- A girl?
- Yes.

343
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:24,154
Son, I have shown you all the girls.

344
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,280
What's so special about her?

345
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,649
Special? Dad, that girl is matchless!

346
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,171
She's a flower whose..

347
00:37:34,792 --> 00:37:35,535
(Sniffs)

348
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:37,793
..fragrance can make a man crazy!

349
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,829
- You, here?
- Yes, I was waiting for you.

350
00:38:10,786 --> 00:38:12,030
Waiting for me?

351
00:38:14,855 --> 00:38:16,567
This watch is great.

352
00:38:19,072 --> 00:38:21,916
Everybody liked it. My choice.

353
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:25,454
- Your choice?
- I mean, your choice.

354
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:30,252
Then I realized you've
given me such a beautiful gift..

355
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:32,253
..and I didn't even thank you.

356
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:36,297
Okay, so you've come only to thank me.

357
00:38:37,227 --> 00:38:38,132
Yes.

358
00:38:40,724 --> 00:38:43,994
Should I drop you home?
I'm also going that way.

359
00:38:45,127 --> 00:38:48,541
- But I'm going to church.
- Then I'll drop you at the church.

360
00:38:49,271 --> 00:38:51,073
But, you were going home.

361
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,751
I'll drop you to the church,
then go home.

362
00:38:57,299 --> 00:38:58,256
Let's go.

363
00:39:03,665 --> 00:39:05,343
Hi, Sanju!

364
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:10,343
- They're your friends?
- Yes, my friend and an acquaintance.

365
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:12,866
Wonder what they must be thinking.

366
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:14,300
What must they be thinking?

367
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,944
They must be wondering with
which girl he's moving about.

368
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,718
Moving about? I'm going to the church.

369
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:22,119
It's not written on our foreheads
that we're going to church.

370
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,727
They must be thinking
who this girl is!

371
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:27,184
I'll tell them that you're my friend.

372
00:39:28,196 --> 00:39:29,630
Friendship is between boys.

373
00:39:30,561 --> 00:39:33,195
People call friendship between
a girl and a boy something else.

374
00:39:35,161 --> 00:39:38,969
Do you have a friend
whom you love or adore?

375
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,587
No, I never got such an opportunity.

376
00:39:41,944 --> 00:39:45,412
I don't believe it.
There must be someone somewhere..

377
00:39:45,492 --> 00:39:49,510
..whose thoughts or sight,
makes your heart race.

378
00:39:50,735 --> 00:39:53,232
- It has happened once.
- Where?

379
00:39:54,048 --> 00:39:56,768
I had gone to buy a sari
in a departmental store.

380
00:39:57,224 --> 00:39:58,307
For her?

381
00:39:58,387 --> 00:40:02,508
No, for my sister-in-law.
Suddenly I saw her there.

382
00:40:02,683 --> 00:40:03,658
Then?

383
00:40:04,145 --> 00:40:07,690
Then my heart raced
and I kept looking at her.

384
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,090
Just kept looking at her.

385
00:40:10,361 --> 00:40:12,170
You didn't ask her name?

386
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:15,875
Before that,
she disappeared in the store's crowd.

387
00:40:17,908 --> 00:40:20,422
What if you see that girl again?

388
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,889
Then I'll surely ask her name.

389
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:27,898
Here is your church.

390
00:40:28,234 --> 00:40:31,087
Yesterday I found Sanjay
Malhotra's address in your suit.

391
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,367
Is it an important paper?

392
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,389
Yes.

393
00:40:37,196 --> 00:40:41,057
It's the address of that boy
who saved my life in Bangalore.

394
00:40:41,765 --> 00:40:44,555
I was sorry I couldn't even thank him.

395
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:47,198
Because, he had completed
his training and left.

396
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,285
But this address is in Bombay.

397
00:40:50,195 --> 00:40:53,905
This is also a coincidence
that he too stays in this city.

398
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:59,838
I'll meet Sanjay Malhotra
as soon as I'm free and thank him.

399
00:41:26,605 --> 00:41:27,879
Vijay.

400
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,533
- Raj.
- Vijay.

401
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:34,271
"After separating from you
I spent my days in sorrow."

402
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:44,255
"After separating from you
I spent my days in sorrow."

403
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,892
"I spent my days in sorrow."

404
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:55,314
"Sometimes I remembered you."

405
00:42:55,394 --> 00:42:57,680
"Sometimes I took your name."

406
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,071
"Sometimes I remembered you."

407
00:43:00,151 --> 00:43:02,163
"Sometimes I took your name."

408
00:43:07,285 --> 00:43:11,932
- "What am I without you?
- Without you what am I?"

409
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:16,312
"I won't see the day
I don't meet you!"

410
00:43:40,485 --> 00:43:43,384
(Applause)

411
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,989
- I was just thinking about you.
- About me?

412
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,119
I was thinking that if
you again meet that girl..

413
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:53,749
- then you'll lose her again!
- Why?

414
00:43:54,259 --> 00:43:56,640
I don't think you'll
even ask her name.

415
00:43:57,424 --> 00:43:58,887
This time I'll surely ask..

416
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,467
..but you'll have
to help me recognize her.

417
00:44:03,834 --> 00:44:07,432
Okay. How does she look?

418
00:44:08,573 --> 00:44:10,823
Beautiful. Very beautiful.

419
00:44:11,823 --> 00:44:12,976
Just like you.

420
00:44:15,976 --> 00:44:17,280
And her eyes?

421
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,573
Like a deep lake. Just like yours.

422
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:26,682
Her color?

423
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,563
Fair. Same as yours.

424
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,877
The color of her hair?

425
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:40,574
A little, no exactly like yours.

426
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:45,377
Her laughter, a little..

427
00:44:47,203 --> 00:44:50,029
..no exactly like yours.

428
00:44:51,518 --> 00:44:55,408
She's so much like me, then
it won't be difficult finding her.

429
00:44:56,594 --> 00:45:00,344
Okay, let's imagine that
I'm that girl, for some time.

430
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,261
Then what will you tell her?

431
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,778
Firstly, I'll ask her name.

432
00:45:13,962 --> 00:45:15,756
'This time I'll surely ask..'

433
00:45:16,136 --> 00:45:19,327
'..but you'll have to
help me recognize her.'

434
00:45:19,407 --> 00:45:21,381
'Okay. How does she look?'

435
00:45:21,461 --> 00:45:23,521
'Beautiful. Very beautiful.'

436
00:45:26,216 --> 00:45:27,556
'Just like you.'

437
00:45:28,373 --> 00:45:29,747
'And her eyes? '

438
00:45:30,513 --> 00:45:33,932
'Like a deep lake. Just like yours.'

439
00:45:34,454 --> 00:45:37,074
'Her laughter is, a little..'

440
00:45:42,896 --> 00:45:44,165
'..exactly like yours.'

441
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:46,844
'She's so much like me..'

442
00:45:47,171 --> 00:45:49,389
'..then it won't be
difficult finding her.'

443
00:45:50,693 --> 00:45:54,233
'Okay, let's imagine that
I'm that girl, for some time.'

444
00:45:54,873 --> 00:45:59,327
- 'Then what'll you tell her?'
- 'Firstly I'll ask her name.'

445
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:06,511
Okay Sanju,
even I'll make you say this.

446
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:11,262
Jenny, I love you.

447
00:46:18,301 --> 00:46:19,581
(Brakes squeal)

448
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:33,153
- Hello.
- Hello.

449
00:46:33,233 --> 00:46:35,025
Did you hurt yourself that day?

450
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:37,904
No, but you remember it today?

451
00:46:37,984 --> 00:46:42,143
I've being going around this
place ever since that accident.

452
00:46:42,223 --> 00:46:43,556
He is gone.

453
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:50,708
'Jenny, this is the chance
to kill two birds with one stone!'

454
00:46:50,788 --> 00:46:52,458
'Increase the fire!'

455
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:55,338
Will you do something?

456
00:46:55,418 --> 00:46:57,643
Just command. I'll even give my life.

457
00:46:57,723 --> 00:46:59,485
No. For now just give me a lift.

458
00:46:59,565 --> 00:47:01,210
- Okay, come.
- Come.

459
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:18,074
Sanju!

460
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:19,548
Sanju!

461
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:23,346
You just watch do nothing.

462
00:47:23,426 --> 00:47:23,946
What's it?

463
00:47:24,026 --> 00:47:26,607
Look over there,
Maheshnath is going to Jenny's house.

464
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:32,355
Jenny!

465
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:33,457
Jenny!

466
00:47:34,613 --> 00:47:36,222
What's it? Why are you yelling?

467
00:47:36,302 --> 00:47:37,926
Why did Maheshnath come here?

468
00:47:38,006 --> 00:47:40,461
You're very innocent, Sanju.
You don't even know..

469
00:47:40,854 --> 00:47:45,587
..why a young, rich boy visits
a beautiful girl's house?

470
00:47:46,326 --> 00:47:48,847
He came to ask for my hand.

471
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:52,102
- What?
- Even I was so shocked.

472
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:55,150
And I said, yes.

473
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,347
And you said yes?

474
00:47:56,427 --> 00:47:58,477
There was no question of saying no.

475
00:47:58,847 --> 00:48:02,086
A rich boy, only son.
Marvelous bungalow.

476
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:04,521
Big cars! So much money!

477
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:09,553
Sanju, my life will start from London,
Rome and Paris!

478
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:12,869
Honeymoon in Switzerland!

479
00:48:36,691 --> 00:48:39,922
No Jenny, you're lying.

480
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,834
You love only me.

481
00:48:43,794 --> 00:48:44,688
No.

482
00:48:44,872 --> 00:48:49,276
Then why did you color
my image with your love?

483
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:53,174
Unknowingly if a few colors
turned into your image..

484
00:48:53,626 --> 00:48:54,852
..what's my fault?

485
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,008
No Jenny, swear on me and say..

486
00:48:58,433 --> 00:49:00,488
..you haven't made this
sketch with your heart.

487
00:49:02,619 --> 00:49:04,749
Say that you don't love me.

488
00:49:07,217 --> 00:49:08,600
How can I lie?

489
00:49:11,695 --> 00:49:12,978
I love you.

490
00:49:15,022 --> 00:49:17,693
(Music)

491
00:49:48,282 --> 00:49:53,744
"Look, listen."

492
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:58,697
"I love you."

493
00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:04,291
"Look, Listen."

494
00:50:04,954 --> 00:50:08,994
"I love you."

495
00:50:09,852 --> 00:50:18,272
"Say it once more that you love me."

496
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:24,134
"I'll not say it once
but a hundred times."

497
00:50:24,214 --> 00:50:32,371
"I admit it, yes, I love you."

498
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:42,003
"Say it once more that you love me."

499
00:50:43,816 --> 00:50:48,472
(Music)

500
00:51:07,952 --> 00:51:16,916
"Running after your dreams.
Staying awake for long nights."

501
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:27,080
"Running after your dreams.
Staying awake for long nights."

502
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:35,147
"I wait for you, yes, I love you."

503
00:51:36,818 --> 00:51:45,230
"I admit it, yes, I love you."

504
00:51:46,669 --> 00:51:50,068
(Music)

505
00:52:30,144 --> 00:52:35,272
"In my heart there were many desires."

506
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:40,718
"In my heart there were many desires."

507
00:52:40,798 --> 00:52:45,534
"Since so long, I wanted to say it."

508
00:52:45,614 --> 00:52:53,969
"Today I say it, yes, I love you."

509
00:52:55,357 --> 00:53:03,514
"I accept it, yes, I love you."

510
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:13,031
"I accept it, yes, I love you."

511
00:53:20,229 --> 00:53:22,944
(Humming)

512
00:53:27,899 --> 00:53:29,067
(Switch clicks)

513
00:53:39,864 --> 00:53:41,636
You love Sanju!

514
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:45,580
Now I'll put you in such a plight
that the whole area will see it!

515
00:53:58,816 --> 00:53:59,934
Sanju!

516
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:01,412
Sanju!

517
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:02,810
Sanju!

518
00:54:04,093 --> 00:54:07,365
Shout, I'll see who'll save you now!

519
00:55:12,109 --> 00:55:14,306
Move aside!

520
00:55:30,044 --> 00:55:30,936
Move aside!

521
00:56:45,344 --> 00:56:47,449
Mahesh son, what happened, dear?

522
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:50,684
All this fight was because
of Pinto's daughter, Jenny.

523
00:56:51,832 --> 00:56:53,293
Our Mahesh sir didn't know that..

524
00:56:53,373 --> 00:56:56,032
..Jenny's going steady
with Raj's brother Sanju.

525
00:56:57,583 --> 00:57:00,881
Without thinking that
goon started hitting Mahesh.

526
00:57:09,127 --> 00:57:10,502
(Switch clicks)

527
00:57:22,828 --> 00:57:26,085
I've come to your house to tell you..

528
00:57:27,074 --> 00:57:29,383
..to get out of my son's way.

529
00:57:30,267 --> 00:57:33,290
Or else, if things
don't work out smoothly..

530
00:57:34,835 --> 00:57:37,654
..I'll have to try different means!

531
00:57:40,713 --> 00:57:45,739
This pen you see
has ink in two colors.

532
00:57:46,223 --> 00:57:47,904
Black and red.

533
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,251
When I sign in red..

534
00:57:52,124 --> 00:57:55,407
..there's only ruin and destruction!

535
00:58:09,193 --> 00:58:10,421
Jenny

536
00:58:20,788 --> 00:58:25,475
You destruct with the
red ink and I use it to adorn.

537
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:49,947
'The king of the sea,
the owner of Kedar Shipping Company..

538
00:58:50,515 --> 00:58:55,707
..so powerless and helpless!'

539
00:58:55,787 --> 00:58:59,596
'Kedarnath you've always
written or erased..

540
00:58:59,676 --> 00:59:02,546
..other people's
destinies with your pen..

541
00:59:02,859 --> 00:59:07,909
..and when it's about of your
son's destiny, you've run out of ink?'

542
00:59:14,112 --> 00:59:19,358
I've decided to make your daughter..

543
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,868
..the daughter-in-law of my house.

544
00:59:23,406 --> 00:59:24,749
What're you thinking about?

545
00:59:25,552 --> 00:59:29,085
Sir, but that, Jenny..

546
00:59:30,376 --> 00:59:33,950
If you ask Jenny
she'll surely refuse.

547
00:59:34,669 --> 00:59:37,183
I'm not habituated to refusals.

548
00:59:38,411 --> 00:59:41,352
Yes, if she comes willingly..

549
00:59:42,346 --> 00:59:44,872
..then to celebrate
my son's marriage..

550
00:59:46,344 --> 00:59:49,634
I'll forgive Sanju
and his family's life.

551
00:59:49,714 --> 00:59:51,471
He may be Kedarnath sir for you!

552
00:59:51,829 --> 00:59:55,590
Working for him doesn't mean
that even your kids should serve him.

553
00:59:55,670 --> 00:59:58,427
It's not about service,
it's about my daughter.

554
00:59:58,507 --> 01:00:00,721
He has threatened
to kill Sanjay and now..

555
01:00:00,801 --> 01:00:03,884
If anything happens to my Sanju,
then even I'll kill myself.

556
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:05,699
You're talking about death?

557
01:00:06,155 --> 01:00:08,971
If only your death could've
solved these problems..

558
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:12,047
..then I'd have strangled you
and killed myself too!

559
01:00:12,908 --> 01:00:16,363
It'll be of no use as Kedarnath sir..

560
01:00:16,443 --> 01:00:20,754
..has put all their lives at stake
to make you his daughter-in-law.

561
01:00:21,748 --> 01:00:23,710
What will happen to my life, papa?

562
01:00:25,037 --> 01:00:28,380
By marrying Mahesh
I'll be as good as dead.

563
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:33,529
If Kedarnath can buy
his son's happiness..

564
01:00:33,774 --> 01:00:36,427
..then why can't you?
You're a father too.

565
01:00:39,412 --> 01:00:42,169
Papa, take me to him.

566
01:00:42,618 --> 01:00:45,389
I'll beg him for everybody's life.

567
01:00:45,469 --> 01:00:46,777
No Jenny!

568
01:00:47,236 --> 01:00:49,960
He hasn't a heart, it's a stone!

569
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,141
He only knows to talk, not to listen.

570
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:57,765
No matter how much you implore,
he'll silence all your please!

571
01:01:00,025 --> 01:01:02,074
That demon won't listen, dear.

572
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,946
He has decided and no one
can change this decision.

573
01:01:06,848 --> 01:01:08,675
What is your decision?

574
01:01:17,524 --> 01:01:21,233
Dear, your father
has made no decision.

575
01:01:22,492 --> 01:01:24,971
It's you who has to decide.

576
01:01:25,051 --> 01:01:28,644
Will you give Sanju life or death?

577
01:01:29,156 --> 01:01:30,321
Papa!

578
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:41,887
'Your father has made no decision.
It's you who has to decide.'

579
01:01:42,753 --> 01:01:44,868
'Will you give Sanju life or death?'

580
01:01:44,948 --> 01:01:45,996
(Crying)

581
01:01:46,259 --> 01:01:48,093
'Will you give Sanju life or death?'

582
01:01:48,173 --> 01:01:50,072
(Crying)

583
01:01:56,228 --> 01:01:58,317
What? Jenny is getting married?

584
01:01:59,189 --> 01:02:01,450
No, this is not possible!

585
01:02:02,184 --> 01:02:05,730
- You must be mistaken.
- There's no question of that, Shanti.

586
01:02:06,043 --> 01:02:09,725
There's only one Pinto in our company,
Edwin Pinto.

587
01:02:09,864 --> 01:02:12,823
He has only one daughter,
whose name is Jenny.

588
01:02:13,176 --> 01:02:16,393
But Jenny loves our Sanju.

589
01:02:16,473 --> 01:02:17,558
Maybe.

590
01:02:17,877 --> 01:02:20,338
But she's marrying
Kedarnath's son, Shanti.

591
01:02:22,172 --> 01:02:25,161
So finally what you had
in your heart is on this card.

592
01:02:26,057 --> 01:02:30,785
You decided to fulfill your
dream of a honeymoon in Switzerland.

593
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:34,985
Those whose dreams
come true are fortunate.

594
01:02:35,065 --> 01:02:39,061
And those who leave
one for another are lowly!

595
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:43,029
Have you ever thought
what your status is?

596
01:02:43,545 --> 01:02:46,820
Did you think I'll live frugally
in your imaginary world and..

597
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,582
.praise you day and night?

598
01:02:49,497 --> 01:02:53,097
I've come out of misty dreams
and seen the sky for the first time.

599
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:56,331
And in that sky I've seen my future!

600
01:02:56,411 --> 01:03:00,883
In that sky you've seen your Maheshnath.
Your future husband!

601
01:03:00,963 --> 01:03:03,736
Yes, I've seen my future husband!

602
01:03:05,774 --> 01:03:08,546
I feel like punishing
you so severely..

603
01:03:08,626 --> 01:03:13,247
..that no girl dares
to deceive in love.

604
01:03:13,722 --> 01:03:19,245
But no, I'll leave you
assuming that you were shadow..

605
01:03:19,494 --> 01:03:21,468
..that was with me for sometime..

606
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,886
..and vanished under
the glitter of wealth.

607
01:03:24,683 --> 01:03:25,852
Get lost!

608
01:03:35,367 --> 01:03:37,242
Enough Pinto,
how much more will you drink?

609
01:03:37,322 --> 01:03:41,270
Let me drink, Michael, till..

610
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,620
Till the money given
by Kedarnath is over!

611
01:03:48,953 --> 01:03:50,574
You said that..

612
01:03:52,145 --> 01:03:56,110
..to your uncle?

613
01:03:56,413 --> 01:04:00,052
You did good, son, very good.

614
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:02,876
Beware if you ever call me son.

615
01:04:03,436 --> 01:04:05,534
What will you do?

616
01:04:05,782 --> 01:04:09,292
You'll hit me, come on hit me!

617
01:04:09,372 --> 01:04:10,854
No, Pinto.

618
01:04:11,152 --> 01:04:15,583
Shameless fathers like
you can't die nor can your kids.

619
01:04:15,905 --> 01:04:19,768
Forget love, for money, they
can even sell their dignity, Pinto!

620
01:04:19,848 --> 01:04:24,645
Sanju! You said this
about your Jenny..

621
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:29,130
..who staked her life to save
yours and your family's honor!

622
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:35,326
Jenny didn't sell her
love for Kedarnath's money.

623
01:04:35,406 --> 01:04:38,043
Pinto didn't sell his daughter, Sanju!

624
01:04:38,242 --> 01:04:40,692
We have bought your life.

625
01:04:41,589 --> 01:04:44,497
Kedarnath didn't want an
ordinary daughter-in-law like Jenny.

626
01:04:45,017 --> 01:04:47,485
He wants Pinto's dignity!

627
01:04:47,861 --> 01:04:49,673
He wants your dignity!

628
01:04:50,144 --> 01:04:53,513
Do you think Jenny will
stay alive in that house?

629
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:56,199
My daughter will die..

630
01:04:56,279 --> 01:05:00,759
..but not let you be dishonored Sanju!

631
01:05:02,268 --> 01:05:06,439
Yes, nothing should be lacking.
Our guests will come by 7.30-8.

632
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,809
Before the groom's party arrives
it should all be completed. Okay?

633
01:05:16,282 --> 01:05:18,435
How did you enter without permission?

634
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:23,368
To invite or to be invited,
permission isn't needed, Kedar sir!

635
01:05:29,212 --> 01:05:33,412
I've heard that you've printed
1,001 wedding cards for your son.

636
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:37,368
And I? I've printed just one card.

637
01:05:38,223 --> 01:05:41,513
And this card has your name on it.

638
01:05:42,673 --> 01:05:46,581
On your card it's written
Jenny weds Maheshnath.

639
01:05:46,878 --> 01:05:51,760
On my card it's written
Jenny weds Sanjay Malhotra.

640
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:57,217
It's a strange coincidence
that the time and place is identical..

641
01:05:57,869 --> 01:05:59,036
..and so is the wedding dais!

642
01:06:00,412 --> 01:06:01,782
Please do come.

643
01:06:02,694 --> 01:06:05,651
Coming and going will happen later,
Sanjay sir.

644
01:06:06,605 --> 01:06:09,554
First of all I congratulate
you on your guts.

645
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:14,466
For the first time someone
has entered Kedarnath sir's office..

646
01:06:14,546 --> 01:06:16,269
..without permission..

647
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:20,927
..dared to look into his eyes
and talk to him!

648
01:06:21,796 --> 01:06:27,503
As for the wedding, we'll see
for whom it's a wedding dais..

649
01:06:28,078 --> 01:06:30,002
..and for whom it becomes a graveyard!

650
01:06:32,295 --> 01:06:37,127
Kedar sir, order sandalwood logs.

651
01:06:49,041 --> 01:06:50,672
Come.

652
01:06:52,618 --> 01:06:54,011
- Give it to me.
- Make her wear this.

653
01:06:54,091 --> 01:06:54,955
He has sent this necklace!

654
01:06:55,035 --> 01:06:57,336
- Slowly.
- Yes make her wear it.

655
01:06:57,416 --> 01:07:03,971
"Once you had told me..

656
01:07:05,887 --> 01:07:11,506
..that you love me."

657
01:07:13,699 --> 01:07:19,012
"Not once, but you had..

658
01:07:19,670 --> 01:07:23,123
..said it a hundred times!"

659
01:07:24,976 --> 01:07:31,920
"You love me."

660
01:07:41,484 --> 01:07:42,401
Papa, he..

661
01:07:42,481 --> 01:07:46,271
Dear, I don't know what's
written in your destiny.

662
01:07:47,107 --> 01:07:49,041
But I can surely
say this much to you..

663
01:07:49,827 --> 01:07:52,606
..since he has come knocking
on the door of death.

664
01:07:53,293 --> 01:07:57,278
He won't let this red dress
turn into a funeral dress.

665
01:07:57,518 --> 01:07:59,242
Go, dear.

666
01:08:43,972 --> 01:08:48,649
"On one side there
is this helpless love."

667
01:08:48,729 --> 01:08:53,265
"On one side is this whole world!"

668
01:08:53,345 --> 01:08:57,968
"Wonder what will happen today."

669
01:08:58,048 --> 01:09:02,489
"Wonder what will happen today."

670
01:09:11,983 --> 01:09:16,594
"On one side there
is this helpless love."

671
01:09:16,674 --> 01:09:21,353
"On one side is this whole world!"

672
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:25,653
"Wonder what will happen today."

673
01:09:26,068 --> 01:09:30,723
"Wonder what will happen today."

674
01:10:14,894 --> 01:10:16,900
(Police siren wails)

675
01:10:23,742 --> 01:10:29,763
"How much power does this world have?"

676
01:10:30,889 --> 01:10:36,769
"How much enthusiasm
does this crazy heart have?"

677
01:10:37,783 --> 01:10:42,661
"How much power does this world have?"

678
01:10:42,741 --> 01:10:47,540
"How much enthusiasm
does this crazy heart have?"

679
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:51,914
"Today we have to test this!"

680
01:10:52,276 --> 01:10:56,936
"Wonder what will happen today."

681
01:10:57,016 --> 01:11:01,546
"Wonder what will happen today."

682
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:04,366
(Police siren wails)

683
01:11:28,870 --> 01:11:31,357
(Police siren wails)

684
01:11:31,995 --> 01:11:33,271
(Brakes squeal)

685
01:11:40,656 --> 01:11:46,913
"Now let anything happen,
I've don't care!"

686
01:11:49,727 --> 01:11:56,133
"Now let anything happen,
I've don't care!"

687
01:11:58,417 --> 01:12:05,533
"Today either you won't
be there or I won't be."

688
01:12:05,833 --> 01:12:10,488
"Love is so crazy!"

689
01:12:10,568 --> 01:12:15,027
"Wonder what will happen today."

690
01:12:15,107 --> 01:12:19,641
"Wonder what will happen today."

691
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:31,173
Greetings commissioner sir,
see today is my son's wedding..

692
01:12:31,253 --> 01:12:33,174
..and this loafer is misbehaving here.

693
01:12:34,066 --> 01:12:35,225
I know.

694
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:59,376
(Phone rings)

695
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:03,810
- Hello.
- Who is this?

696
01:14:04,008 --> 01:14:05,823
This is Kedarnath speaking.

697
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:09,184
Kedarnath sir,
you're having a really bad day.

698
01:14:09,795 --> 01:14:11,585
All the numbers get connected to you.

699
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:15,967
I called the airport to book
the tickets for our honeymoon..

700
01:14:16,315 --> 01:14:17,551
..but the call went to you!

701
01:14:17,631 --> 01:14:20,299
- Scum!
- Don't yell, Kedar sir!

702
01:14:20,826 --> 01:14:25,544
I know your state;
you're ashamed of your defeat.

703
01:14:26,148 --> 01:14:30,019
You're thinking there can be no
one as impotent as you in this city!

704
01:14:30,229 --> 01:14:31,619
You bastard!

705
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:33,622
You called me impotent?

706
01:14:33,702 --> 01:14:37,424
Not only me, but the whole
city is calling you a eunuch.

707
01:14:37,504 --> 01:14:39,465
- Stop your nonsense!
- Shut up, eunuch!

708
01:14:41,771 --> 01:14:43,394
Nanu..

709
01:14:43,817 --> 01:14:46,506
Nanu! Where are you?

710
01:14:46,586 --> 01:14:49,358
Don't yell, sir! I'm here.

711
01:14:49,704 --> 01:14:52,132
Do you know that Sanju
called me a eunuch!

712
01:14:52,564 --> 01:14:56,115
How dare he call
Kedarnath sir a eunuch!

713
01:14:56,195 --> 01:14:59,189
Then even you should've
clapped your hands!

714
01:14:59,269 --> 01:15:02,423
- Nanu!
- What's there to get so angry about?

715
01:15:02,778 --> 01:15:06,334
Even if he had called you impotent,
how could you harm him?

716
01:15:06,744 --> 01:15:11,652
You served the sweet to
your son and somebody else ate it!

717
01:15:12,001 --> 01:15:16,646
Do one thing sir.
Hold your pants with both your hands.

718
01:15:16,726 --> 01:15:20,847
- What do you mean?
- I mean that guy..

719
01:15:20,927 --> 01:15:24,628
..has already dented your image.

720
01:15:25,308 --> 01:15:29,132
By doing this he
has proven he's a man!

721
01:15:30,265 --> 01:15:32,501
I'll say that it's your mistake.

722
01:15:32,581 --> 01:15:35,503
You invited the whole
world to your son's wedding.

723
01:15:35,583 --> 01:15:39,068
If you had given
Nanubhai Chhatewala one..

724
01:15:39,148 --> 01:15:42,384
..then instead of your nose,
Sanju's neck would've been cut!

725
01:15:44,918 --> 01:15:47,040
Cut his neck now, Nanu!

726
01:15:47,592 --> 01:15:50,039
Cut his neck, that's stiff with pride.

727
01:15:55,756 --> 01:15:56,925
(Phone rings)

728
01:15:58,413 --> 01:15:59,589
(Phone rings)

729
01:16:01,263 --> 01:16:02,495
(Phone rings)

730
01:16:04,148 --> 01:16:05,387
(Phone rings)

731
01:16:07,026 --> 01:16:08,002
Hello.

732
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,671
Hello, who are you? Hello..

733
01:16:49,123 --> 01:16:50,614
How beautiful you are!

734
01:16:51,678 --> 01:16:54,091
Why didn't I look so
carefully at you before?

735
01:16:55,431 --> 01:16:58,274
You'd have seen only if you'd
have spared time from fights.

736
01:16:59,942 --> 01:17:00,962
Vijay.

737
01:17:03,053 --> 01:17:05,439
So late in the night,
is this the time to come?

738
01:17:05,519 --> 01:17:06,700
- What's it?
- Where's Sanju?

739
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,740
Today is his wedding night.

740
01:17:09,259 --> 01:17:14,167
On a wedding night a husband
is with his wife, right?

741
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:20,916
Jenny, I wish our wedding
night is so long..

742
01:17:21,548 --> 01:17:22,818
..that it never ends.

743
01:17:23,613 --> 01:17:25,239
That we merge into each other.

744
01:17:27,295 --> 01:17:29,101
I've come to arrest Sanju.

745
01:17:31,391 --> 01:17:36,256
- But for what?
- Forceful marriage and kidnapping.

746
01:17:37,033 --> 01:17:39,064
Even you were present
at the wedding, Vijay.

747
01:17:39,384 --> 01:17:41,406
Why didn't you arrest him then?

748
01:17:41,606 --> 01:17:43,896
At that time there was
no report against Sanju.

749
01:17:44,553 --> 01:17:49,417
- But now there's a report.
- Brother, you are the law.

750
01:17:50,263 --> 01:17:54,973
Just tonight, don't take Sanju away.

751
01:17:55,167 --> 01:17:58,719
The wedding bed isn't
decorated again, brother.

752
01:17:59,257 --> 01:18:03,936
I promise you tomorrow morning,
I'll bring Sanju to you.

753
01:18:04,016 --> 01:18:05,065
Where's Sanju?

754
01:18:05,145 --> 01:18:06,521
I am here, Vijay brother.

755
01:18:08,759 --> 01:18:09,932
What's it, Vijay brother?

756
01:18:10,012 --> 01:18:12,869
Your Vijay brother has come
to give you your wedding gift.

757
01:18:13,527 --> 01:18:15,013
He has come to arrest you.

758
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:21,882
Sanju, your crime is that
you've kidnapped your own wife.

759
01:18:22,569 --> 01:18:26,339
Is it a crime to marry a girl
and make her your wife?

760
01:18:26,419 --> 01:18:28,413
I don't want to listen
to nonsense, come on.

761
01:18:28,493 --> 01:18:29,666
No Vijay brother, please.

762
01:18:29,746 --> 01:18:33,277
No sister-in-law,
right now he's not your Vijay brother.

763
01:18:33,554 --> 01:18:35,800
He's a police officer, a stranger.

764
01:18:36,243 --> 01:18:40,639
Sister-in-law, I can't tolerate
that you beg in front of a stranger.

765
01:18:42,108 --> 01:18:43,869
Let's go, commissioner Vijay Kapoor.

766
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:54,724
Sister.

767
01:18:58,277 --> 01:18:59,595
Inspector.

768
01:19:02,469 --> 01:19:03,582
- You?
- Yes.

769
01:19:03,662 --> 01:19:04,489
Why did you come here?

770
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:09,492
You used to ask me to come,
sit and chat. That we'd have tea.

771
01:19:09,572 --> 01:19:10,770
Yes, I had.

772
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:14,004
I had called you home, not
in the government's police station.

773
01:19:14,084 --> 01:19:16,250
You're an inspector and are so scared!

774
01:19:16,779 --> 01:19:19,264
As if I'm an inspector
and you're the thief.

775
01:19:19,344 --> 01:19:20,711
We both are thieves.

776
01:19:21,121 --> 01:19:24,566
The difference is I'm a uniformed one
and you, a contract killer.

777
01:19:24,646 --> 01:19:28,153
Before anyone..
for my sake, please go from here.

778
01:19:28,233 --> 01:19:29,275
Okay.

779
01:19:29,906 --> 01:19:31,350
- Where is the tall guy?
- Why?

780
01:19:33,112 --> 01:19:36,784
- I want to kill him.
- If you kill him here then..

781
01:19:37,307 --> 01:19:42,654
..tomorrow morning I'll
be begging on the streets.

782
01:19:42,734 --> 01:19:45,958
- That too in the name of god.
- I've killed many outside.

783
01:19:46,261 --> 01:19:48,037
But never in a police station.

784
01:19:48,387 --> 01:19:50,575
Let me kill him, even I'll be famous.

785
01:19:51,732 --> 01:19:56,245
Your umbrella will open but my
account here will be closed for good.

786
01:19:56,433 --> 01:19:58,719
Okay, even I'm a friend for a friend.

787
01:19:58,967 --> 01:20:01,786
I'll kill him outside.
Okay, I'll take your leave.

788
01:20:01,866 --> 01:20:03,276
Go.

789
01:20:04,811 --> 01:20:08,170
I'll come some other time
to your house, okay?

790
01:20:08,250 --> 01:20:10,358
We'll have tea. Okay?

791
01:20:13,949 --> 01:20:17,103
He was going to get me hanged!

792
01:20:17,183 --> 01:20:19,814
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

793
01:20:20,646 --> 01:20:23,080
I couldn't even think
that you'd stoop so low!

794
01:20:23,681 --> 01:20:26,975
The friend whose
friendship I treasured..

795
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:29,911
..has deceived me!

796
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,365
- Raj!
- This is how you're when I'm alive!

797
01:20:33,153 --> 01:20:34,848
Had I been dead, Vijay..

798
01:20:34,928 --> 01:20:38,930
..you might've dragged
Sanju and Jenny with you.

799
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,534
Raj!

800
01:20:44,527 --> 01:20:48,070
If there was someone in your place,
I'd have killed him.

801
01:20:48,405 --> 01:20:52,067
Before knowing the truth
you accused me of betraying you!

802
01:20:52,147 --> 01:20:53,828
On our friendship?

803
01:20:55,125 --> 01:20:58,354
If you want to know the truth, listen.

804
01:20:59,002 --> 01:21:02,674
By denying Sanju his wedding night
I've not committed any crime..

805
01:21:02,992 --> 01:21:05,158
..instead I've saved his life.

806
01:21:06,746 --> 01:21:10,278
While taking Jenny's palanquin,
you forgot to look behind.

807
01:21:10,505 --> 01:21:16,057
That you've stepped on the tail
of a poisonous snake like Kedarnath.

808
01:21:24,802 --> 01:21:28,755
With great difficulty I've
come here looking for you, sir.

809
01:21:29,132 --> 01:21:33,189
I'm sorry that today
I'll be unable to help you.

810
01:21:33,924 --> 01:21:35,630
Don't say that, sir.

811
01:21:35,944 --> 01:21:40,005
Such a big businessman of
this city can't be stone-hearted!

812
01:21:40,911 --> 01:21:43,391
Today I've not come
as Sanju's sister-in-law..

813
01:21:43,471 --> 01:21:47,716
..but as a mother with some hopes.

814
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,129
A helpless woman
with her hands extended..

815
01:21:51,464 --> 01:21:54,304
..begs you for her child's happiness.

816
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:00,429
Among all these things you're
right about one thing, Shanti.

817
01:22:01,585 --> 01:22:03,680
That I'm a big businessman.

818
01:22:05,009 --> 01:22:10,345
But I don't do business
with my heart but with brains!

819
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:16,587
That's why I haven't
lost on any deal as yet.

820
01:22:17,797 --> 01:22:22,874
I can call up the commissioner
and get your Sanju freed.

821
01:22:24,236 --> 01:22:28,266
But in exchange you'll..

822
01:22:28,627 --> 01:22:30,846
..have to do a deal with me.

823
01:22:31,397 --> 01:22:33,643
- Deal?
- Yes.

824
01:22:35,069 --> 01:22:39,371
You'll have to spend
the night with me.

825
01:22:41,227 --> 01:22:45,115
Kedarnath,
you're really not a human but a beast!

826
01:22:45,195 --> 01:22:47,329
You're more poisonous than a snake!

827
01:22:47,999 --> 01:22:52,352
When a snake is hungry,
it even swallows its own children!

828
01:22:53,227 --> 01:22:55,452
If I let you go then how will your..

829
01:22:56,034 --> 01:23:01,282
..Sanju know that I'm not impotent!

830
01:23:14,819 --> 01:23:18,178
So you think you're very smart!

831
01:23:18,697 --> 01:23:20,691
You and your commissioner friend!

832
01:23:21,646 --> 01:23:24,053
Sent your brother to the
police station. What did you think?

833
01:23:24,497 --> 01:23:27,360
That the police will protect
him for life as their son-law?

834
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,421
That he'll escape from Nanubhai?

835
01:23:31,205 --> 01:23:34,867
Did you both think that
only you both have brains?

836
01:23:35,147 --> 01:23:38,053
If you're smart, then I'm smarter!

837
01:23:38,133 --> 01:23:41,755
With my brains I've bumped off many?

838
01:23:42,597 --> 01:23:43,839
You don't get it?

839
01:23:46,392 --> 01:23:49,535
If your brother won't
leave the station..

840
01:23:49,946 --> 01:23:52,062
..then who'll burn the funeral pyre?

841
01:24:21,437 --> 01:24:23,590
See, I have to kill you..

842
01:24:23,789 --> 01:24:27,580
..then why this hard work? All
this running, getting up and falling..

843
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:29,612
..it's useless, right?
Kill him!

844
01:24:41,104 --> 01:24:42,713
(Laughs)

845
01:24:44,997 --> 01:24:50,305
This is my door Shanti,
it opens when I want..

846
01:24:50,813 --> 01:24:53,038
..and closes when I want.

847
01:24:53,118 --> 01:24:58,353
No. Don't say this,
Kedarnath sir, I'm a married woman.

848
01:24:58,433 --> 01:25:00,025
Don't worry.

849
01:25:01,155 --> 01:25:04,877
Your husband will never
know about this all his life.

850
01:25:04,957 --> 01:25:06,222
Raj!

851
01:25:23,763 --> 01:25:26,789
- Listen!
- No!

852
01:25:30,699 --> 01:25:31,855
Raj!

853
01:25:55,574 --> 01:25:56,557
Nanu!

854
01:25:57,453 --> 01:25:58,933
What did you do!

855
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:03,707
First lesson, Kedar sir.

856
01:26:04,684 --> 01:26:08,833
Persons who walk on the sand of crime
never leave their footprints behind.

857
01:26:09,058 --> 01:26:10,771
Go on, die.

858
01:26:24,061 --> 01:26:26,036
One thing I can't understand is...

859
01:26:26,572 --> 01:26:30,179
..on what charges did
the commissioner arrest you?

860
01:26:30,850 --> 01:26:32,663
Someone must've complained against me.

861
01:26:32,743 --> 01:26:35,567
How strange,
I'm been on duty since yesterday.

862
01:26:35,950 --> 01:26:37,859
The complaint register
is in front of me.

863
01:26:38,126 --> 01:26:40,822
No complaint is
registered against you.

864
01:26:40,902 --> 01:26:43,351
- What do you mean?
- The meaning is clear, brother.

865
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:48,230
You were arrested and your
brother and sister-in-law were killed!

866
01:26:51,571 --> 01:26:52,271
(Chuckles)

867
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:56,643
I think commissioner
sir played a big part in this.

868
01:27:39,924 --> 01:27:50,506
"How can there be friends like us!"

869
01:27:52,479 --> 01:28:02,660
"Buddy, how can we ever be separated?"

870
01:28:05,283 --> 01:28:15,762
"How can there be friends like us!"

871
01:28:17,786 --> 01:28:29,123
"Buddy, how can we ever be separated?"

872
01:28:30,585 --> 01:28:40,350
"How should I drink
this poison of sorrow?"

873
01:28:42,018 --> 01:28:49,032
"How should I live without you?"

874
01:28:49,568 --> 01:28:51,946
"How do I live?"

875
01:28:52,351 --> 01:28:53,734
'The meaning is clear, brother.'

876
01:28:54,033 --> 01:28:58,439
'You were arrested and your brother
and sister-in-law were killed!'

877
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:02,864
(Chuckles)

878
01:29:03,377 --> 01:29:07,175
'I think commissioner
sir played a big part in this.'

879
01:31:05,622 --> 01:31:08,080
- Sanju!
- Sanju, stop!

880
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,897
What are you doing, Sanju?!

881
01:31:09,977 --> 01:31:12,527
- Have you gone crazy?
- Yes, I've gone crazy!

882
01:31:12,766 --> 01:31:14,389
He took away everything from me!

883
01:31:14,591 --> 01:31:16,755
He has killed my brother
and sister-in-law!

884
01:31:16,835 --> 01:31:18,339
I won't spare him. Move.

885
01:31:19,258 --> 01:31:21,451
Sanju, no!

886
01:31:21,531 --> 01:31:22,310
Listen, Sanju.

887
01:31:22,390 --> 01:31:25,139
Sanju, what're you doing?
This isn't right, man.

888
01:31:25,219 --> 01:31:26,757
Leave me!

889
01:31:26,837 --> 01:31:27,861
Leave me!

890
01:31:28,245 --> 01:31:30,709
- Sanju, all this is a lie!
- It's all a lie!

891
01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:34,759
Is it a lie that you arrested me
on my wedding night?

892
01:31:34,839 --> 01:31:38,795
Is it a lie that there's no case
against me in the police register?

893
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:42,118
Is it also a lie that you arrested me...

894
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:45,145
..so you could see my brother
and sister-in-law die?!

895
01:31:45,225 --> 01:31:47,713
- Yes, all this is also a lie!
- Then, what's the truth?

896
01:31:47,793 --> 01:31:49,642
Say what the truth is!

897
01:31:53,289 --> 01:31:56,230
The truth is that you've gone crazy.

898
01:31:56,814 --> 01:31:59,592
Do you think I've killed Raj?

899
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,900
- I killed my friend!
- Yes, you've killed him!

900
01:32:04,814 --> 01:32:07,798
Stop it! What's all this?

901
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:11,300
You want to know the truth.
The truth is..

902
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:16,348
'Don't tell Vijay. He and
I are different and if he finds out..'

903
01:32:16,622 --> 01:32:19,520
'..I wonder what he'll do,
swear on me.'

904
01:32:22,226 --> 01:32:24,295
Remember this, commissioner Kapoor.

905
01:32:25,627 --> 01:32:29,490
In this graveyard I swear
on my brother and sister-in-law's,

906
01:32:30,884 --> 01:32:36,914
I won't rest until
I burn their killers!

907
01:32:38,175 --> 01:32:41,188
Even if one of those pyres is yours!

908
01:33:54,119 --> 01:33:56,671
'If you want to know who
your brother's killers are..'

909
01:33:56,947 --> 01:34:00,406
'..then meet me tonight
at 11 at Ballard Pier.'

910
01:34:24,539 --> 01:34:27,724
You had told me to bring sandalwood.

911
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:31,742
But you've just lit your
brother and sister-in-law's pyres.

912
01:34:33,723 --> 01:34:36,269
This is entirely your fault, Sanju.

913
01:34:37,363 --> 01:34:40,952
You looked into my eyes..

914
01:34:41,583 --> 01:34:43,617
..and spoke about sandalwood.

915
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:48,993
And I burnt your whole family tree!

916
01:34:51,408 --> 01:34:55,047
Look carefully at this place, Sanju.

917
01:34:56,660 --> 01:35:00,673
Your brother and sister-in-law
died somewhere over here.

918
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:07,932
The one who tortured them to death
is none other than Kedarnath sir.

919
01:35:09,220 --> 01:35:13,261
You still haven't spent
your wedding night with Jenny.

920
01:35:13,666 --> 01:35:18,233
But I spent that night
with your sister-in-law.

921
01:35:25,334 --> 01:35:27,236
And here's the evidence of that!

922
01:35:28,927 --> 01:35:34,542
This is the same sari
in which your sister-in-law..

923
01:35:35,367 --> 01:35:37,462
..came to me to beg for your life.

924
01:35:37,542 --> 01:35:41,381
'I'll save it for
some special occasion.'

925
01:36:05,966 --> 01:36:06,709
(Glass shatters)

926
01:36:06,789 --> 01:36:09,961
No, Sanju.
Don't repeat the mistake again!

927
01:36:11,176 --> 01:36:16,892
If you raise a hand on me,
many hands will molest your wife!

928
01:36:17,513 --> 01:36:23,333
Do you know why?
She's in my custody right now.

929
01:36:32,154 --> 01:36:34,804
(Laughs)

930
01:37:07,626 --> 01:37:10,018
Look at this place very carefully,
Kedarnath.

931
01:37:10,796 --> 01:37:15,526
And mark the place where
my brother and sister-in-law died.

932
01:37:16,165 --> 01:37:19,934
Because even I'll make you
squirm and kill you at the same place.

933
01:37:20,729 --> 01:37:25,994
If you don't believe it, look
at this car and imagine your death!

934
01:37:32,983 --> 01:37:34,447
(Car exploded)

935
01:37:38,670 --> 01:37:39,941
Jenny!

936
01:37:40,021 --> 01:37:40,724
Jenny!

937
01:37:41,997 --> 01:37:44,602
- What's it, Sanju?
- Jenny, are you alright?

938
01:37:44,682 --> 01:37:46,589
I'm alright but what's wrong with you?

939
01:37:46,669 --> 01:37:48,390
I was waiting for you since so long!

940
01:37:49,009 --> 01:37:52,514
(Laughs)

941
01:37:53,605 --> 01:37:57,048
(Phone rings)

942
01:37:59,753 --> 01:38:03,075
- Hello.
- You've made your move, Kedarnath.

943
01:38:03,717 --> 01:38:08,075
Now it's my turn. Neither will
I hire a contract killer like you..

944
01:38:08,577 --> 01:38:10,119
..nor erase the proof.

945
01:38:10,642 --> 01:38:14,207
The day I break your stranglehold..

946
01:38:14,443 --> 01:38:20,124
..everyone in the city will sing,
'dead, dead, another one is dead'.

947
01:38:20,204 --> 01:38:21,374
Take this.

948
01:38:28,116 --> 01:38:29,431
From today we're with you.

949
01:38:29,511 --> 01:38:31,518
We've been fed by sister-in-law..

950
01:38:31,598 --> 01:38:32,999
..and scolded by brother.

951
01:38:33,453 --> 01:38:36,234
When it's about relations,
have we become step brothers?!

952
01:38:37,885 --> 01:38:38,700
Not now.

953
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:42,275
I'm waiting for that night which..

954
01:38:43,207 --> 01:38:46,450
..the whole world eagerly awaits.

955
01:38:47,642 --> 01:38:50,467
That night,
I'll give Kedarnath sir a gift..

956
01:38:51,104 --> 01:38:52,898
..he'll not forget for life.

957
01:38:53,901 --> 01:38:56,992
Whenever that night
comes Kedarnath sir..

958
01:38:57,072 --> 01:39:00,742
..will bang his head on the
walls and run away from light!

959
01:39:01,578 --> 01:39:04,458
That night will be new year's night.

960
01:39:07,402 --> 01:39:07,935
(Gunshot)

961
01:39:08,344 --> 01:39:12,045
(Crackers bursting)

962
01:39:30,376 --> 01:39:32,255
Happy new year!

963
01:39:59,965 --> 01:40:00,828
(Gun cocks)

964
01:40:01,222 --> 01:40:01,956
(Magazine loaded)

965
01:40:19,377 --> 01:40:21,183
Catch him!

966
01:40:21,263 --> 01:40:23,096
Catch him!

967
01:40:31,659 --> 01:40:35,041
Catch him!

968
01:40:35,121 --> 01:40:37,668
- Run!
- Catch him!

969
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:40,378
Catch him!

970
01:40:41,649 --> 01:40:44,849
(Panting)

971
01:40:50,376 --> 01:40:52,504
(Tin rattles)

972
01:41:57,297 --> 01:41:57,994
No.

973
01:41:58,923 --> 01:42:00,038
(Empty gun clicks)

974
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,275
(Groans)

975
01:42:44,358 --> 01:42:46,449
No.

976
01:42:54,769 --> 01:42:58,174
Peter, there's no
arrangement over here.

977
01:42:58,715 --> 01:43:01,493
Is this a new year's evening
or are they mourning over here?

978
01:43:02,097 --> 01:43:04,431
I thought there'll be a party here.

979
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:07,521
There'll be a blast, guests will
be there. There'll be a band playing!

980
01:43:07,601 --> 01:43:10,179
(Band playing)

981
01:43:17,770 --> 01:43:19,985
'This was not my brother
and sister-in-law's dream.'

982
01:43:20,633 --> 01:43:21,757
'This is not my goal.'

983
01:43:22,364 --> 01:43:25,186
'I wish that they hadn't
chosen this way to ruin for me!'

984
01:43:29,912 --> 01:43:34,624
(Music)

985
01:44:00,139 --> 01:44:04,055
"Gone, the first one has gone."

986
01:44:04,135 --> 01:44:08,000
"Out of four, one is gone,
there are three pots left!"

987
01:44:08,080 --> 01:44:10,076
"The first has gone!"

988
01:44:17,727 --> 01:44:21,412
"Gone, the first one has gone."

989
01:44:21,492 --> 01:44:25,246
"Out of four, one is gone,
there are three pots left!"

990
01:44:25,326 --> 01:44:29,078
"Gone, the first one has gone."

991
01:44:29,158 --> 01:44:31,317
"Out of four, one is gone.."

992
01:44:32,971 --> 01:44:36,814
"Out of four, one is gone,
there are three pots left!"

993
01:44:36,894 --> 01:44:40,516
"Gone, the first one has gone."

994
01:44:40,596 --> 01:44:44,624
"Out of four, one is gone,
there are three pots left!"

995
01:44:45,088 --> 01:44:50,152
(Music)

996
01:45:25,334 --> 01:45:26,510
(Groans)

997
01:45:33,115 --> 01:45:35,646
- No!
- No! Mahesh!

998
01:45:48,802 --> 01:45:52,651
"Read tomorrow morning's newspaper."

999
01:45:52,731 --> 01:45:56,423
"You read this news, my friend."

1000
01:45:56,503 --> 01:46:00,250
"Read tomorrow morning's newspaper."

1001
01:46:00,330 --> 01:46:04,142
"You read this news, my friend."

1002
01:46:04,222 --> 01:46:07,743
"One traveller lost his way."

1003
01:46:07,823 --> 01:46:10,546
"Out of four, one is gone.."

1004
01:46:11,689 --> 01:46:15,593
"Out of four, one is gone,
there are three pots left!"

1005
01:46:15,673 --> 01:46:19,181
"Gone, the first one has gone."

1006
01:46:19,261 --> 01:46:22,889
"Out of four, one is gone,
there are three pots left!"

1007
01:46:22,969 --> 01:46:26,705
"Gone, the first one has gone."

1008
01:46:26,785 --> 01:46:30,533
"Out of four, one is gone,
there are three pots left!"

1009
01:46:30,613 --> 01:46:34,337
"Gone, the first one has gone."

1010
01:46:34,417 --> 01:46:37,978
"Out of four, one is gone,
there are three pots left!"

1011
01:46:43,425 --> 01:46:48,011
How your son's life slipped
out of your hands like sand!

1012
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:54,211
You made me an orphan,
but I made you heirless!

1013
01:46:55,156 --> 01:47:01,169
You know, when a ship sinks,
who is the first one to go? A rat.

1014
01:47:01,913 --> 01:47:04,364
Then sinks the captain of the ship.

1015
01:47:05,027 --> 01:47:07,794
You're the captain of that ship!

1016
01:47:08,517 --> 01:47:12,301
Your son was the
first rat of that ship.

1017
01:47:13,663 --> 01:47:16,220
Good luck and happy new year.

1018
01:47:24,160 --> 01:47:26,928
(Wailing)

1019
01:47:28,723 --> 01:47:33,059
Why didn't Sanju's corpse
burn instead of my son?!

1020
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:41,881
I saw victory in his eyes, Nanu.

1021
01:47:43,375 --> 01:47:47,690
He was looking into my eyes
and making fun of my sorrow.

1022
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:54,189
Amidst a crowd he kept a hand on
my shoulder, threatened me and left!

1023
01:47:56,305 --> 01:47:59,525
He kept a hand on
Kedarnath's shoulder!

1024
01:48:00,980 --> 01:48:05,538
My shoulders can endure the
weight of my dead son's corpse.

1025
01:48:06,237 --> 01:48:09,481
But they couldn't endure
the weight of his living hands.

1026
01:48:10,798 --> 01:48:14,749
I want his hands, Nanu.

1027
01:48:16,136 --> 01:48:20,646
Forget the hand, if you say,
then I'll bring his corpse.

1028
01:48:20,726 --> 01:48:24,699
Not his corpse,
I just want his hands, Nanu.

1029
01:48:25,544 --> 01:48:28,401
Get his hands and throw
them in front of me.

1030
01:48:28,832 --> 01:48:32,794
I'll stand on his hands
and snatch away his victory!

1031
01:48:32,874 --> 01:48:35,205
When Nanu kills someone, sir.

1032
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:37,405
He doesn't even take god's name.

1033
01:48:38,347 --> 01:48:40,052
Sir, I'll cut his hands
and give them to you.

1034
01:48:40,132 --> 01:48:44,141
But what about his tongue,
which, all his life..

1035
01:48:44,221 --> 01:48:46,911
..will keep saying,
'Nanubhai' like a parrot?

1036
01:48:47,367 --> 01:48:51,404
Kedar sir, I'll do this small job.

1037
01:48:53,421 --> 01:49:00,175
I'll cut his hands in such a way,
that he won't even realize.

1038
01:49:17,089 --> 01:49:22,114
Coincidentally,
I'm investigating Maheshnath's murder.

1039
01:49:22,769 --> 01:49:25,363
The whole city knows
it was an accident.

1040
01:49:25,443 --> 01:49:31,097
But I know that it wasn't.
It's a case of murder!

1041
01:49:31,826 --> 01:49:35,587
You're great!
How beautifully you executed it!

1042
01:49:35,816 --> 01:49:37,339
Even saved yourself.

1043
01:49:37,419 --> 01:49:41,499
This is just the beginning.
Mahesh was my first target.

1044
01:49:42,356 --> 01:49:45,722
- What do you mean?
- I mean the second, then the third..

1045
01:49:45,975 --> 01:49:47,900
..even the fourth target,
is still left.

1046
01:49:49,654 --> 01:49:51,233
I gave you such great news..

1047
01:49:51,385 --> 01:49:53,410
..and you didn't even
ask the victims' names!

1048
01:49:54,621 --> 01:49:55,639
What're the names?

1049
01:49:55,719 --> 01:49:59,112
My second victim
is Nanubhai Chhatewala.

1050
01:49:59,881 --> 01:50:02,312
The third will be Kedarnath.

1051
01:50:02,644 --> 01:50:04,989
- Fourth?
- The fourth murder will also happen.

1052
01:50:05,496 --> 01:50:08,885
I'll leave it's proof with you,
inspector Dube.

1053
01:50:09,410 --> 01:50:11,605
- With me?
- Yes, with you.

1054
01:50:12,167 --> 01:50:16,421
But you'll regret not being
able to tell anyone anything.

1055
01:50:17,183 --> 01:50:21,446
- Why?
- Because dead bodies don't talk.

1056
01:50:24,569 --> 01:50:25,918
Listen to this as well.

1057
01:50:26,556 --> 01:50:31,907
If you enjoy recording voices,
then don't keep the microphone..

1058
01:50:32,361 --> 01:50:34,238
..where even a child can notice it.

1059
01:50:40,134 --> 01:50:41,546
The cassette is over here, Dube.

1060
01:50:43,551 --> 01:50:47,525
Don't forget this, Dube, even
I took the police force's training.

1061
01:50:50,513 --> 01:50:54,872
Listen Sanju,
you must've heard this saying.

1062
01:50:55,729 --> 01:50:59,459
A clever crow always poops on garbage.

1063
01:51:00,562 --> 01:51:03,811
You confessed your crimes in front..

1064
01:51:03,891 --> 01:51:06,040
..of a police officer
at a police station.

1065
01:51:07,235 --> 01:51:11,465
When a responsible police officer
says this in court..

1066
01:51:11,720 --> 01:51:13,729
..no other proof will be needed.

1067
01:51:17,669 --> 01:51:18,430
(Slaps)

1068
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:26,314
Tomorrow, first bring the
evidence of this slap, Mr. P.K Dube.

1069
01:51:34,733 --> 01:51:37,766
The bull slapped me!

1070
01:51:49,260 --> 01:51:53,706
Know what they call this place?

1071
01:51:53,786 --> 01:51:55,409
You called me here to ask this?

1072
01:51:55,747 --> 01:51:58,639
No, to tell you that..

1073
01:51:59,408 --> 01:52:03,530
..you could've punished the killers
of your brother and sister-in-law

1074
01:52:04,039 --> 01:52:07,353
..only as a police officer.

1075
01:52:08,556 --> 01:52:12,544
You made the biggest mistake
by rejecting this department.

1076
01:52:12,624 --> 01:52:17,502
It's true that as a police officer,
I could've arrested them.

1077
01:52:18,083 --> 01:52:22,597
But couldn't have punished them
as only the law can punish.

1078
01:52:22,677 --> 01:52:25,286
Do you know the consequences of..

1079
01:52:26,110 --> 01:52:29,029
..walking on the path
you've adopted? This.

1080
01:52:31,203 --> 01:52:33,609
Commissioner,
we both have to die one day.

1081
01:52:34,243 --> 01:52:36,798
But if I die fighting this battle..

1082
01:52:37,208 --> 01:52:39,352
..then my brother's
soul will rest in peace.

1083
01:52:39,703 --> 01:52:41,636
Sister-in-law will be proud of me.

1084
01:52:42,905 --> 01:52:45,801
But if you succeed
in saving those killers..

1085
01:52:46,216 --> 01:52:48,810
..then brother will be
ashamed of his friendship.

1086
01:52:49,175 --> 01:52:52,216
People will lose faith in friendship,
commissioner.

1087
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:56,689
But this won't happen,
Mr. Vijay Kapoor.

1088
01:52:57,095 --> 01:52:58,581
Because only I will win.

1089
01:53:12,801 --> 01:53:13,697
Hello.

1090
01:53:21,117 --> 01:53:22,972
Hello.

1091
01:53:31,018 --> 01:53:31,947
Jenny.

1092
01:53:32,027 --> 01:53:33,880
Tell me the reason
for calling me here.

1093
01:53:34,043 --> 01:53:38,209
You know who's responsible
for Maheshnath's death?

1094
01:53:39,194 --> 01:53:39,825
(Chuckles)

1095
01:53:40,664 --> 01:53:43,474
Is this a question
or a new trick of the law?

1096
01:53:44,231 --> 01:53:48,893
Even you,
like your husband, have been blinded.

1097
01:53:49,126 --> 01:53:50,880
Yesterday Sanju came
to the police station..

1098
01:53:51,417 --> 01:53:54,555
..and threatened inspector
Dube in front of everyone.

1099
01:53:55,042 --> 01:54:00,333
If the inspector dies on his own,
Sanju will be blamed.

1100
01:54:01,048 --> 01:54:03,222
If you want to save
your husband's life..

1101
01:54:03,608 --> 01:54:05,488
..stop him from acting this way.

1102
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:10,218
Or all your life you'll repent
for having lost your husband.

1103
01:54:21,166 --> 01:54:25,843
(Music)

1104
01:55:59,347 --> 01:56:01,868
"Touch me!"

1105
01:56:01,948 --> 01:56:04,175
"Touch me!"

1106
01:56:04,255 --> 01:56:06,885
"Touch me!"

1107
01:56:06,965 --> 01:56:09,370
"Touch me!"

1108
01:56:09,918 --> 01:56:18,834
(Music)

1109
01:56:19,174 --> 01:56:21,714
"Touch me!"

1110
01:56:21,794 --> 01:56:24,219
"Touch me!"

1111
01:56:24,754 --> 01:56:35,507
"My beauty, my colour,
my every part, says come touch me."

1112
01:56:35,587 --> 01:56:40,015
"Touch, come and touch me."

1113
01:56:40,095 --> 01:56:45,595
"My friend, that first love,
wonder how you've forgotten it."

1114
01:56:45,675 --> 01:56:50,784
"Touch, come and touch me."

1115
01:56:50,864 --> 01:56:55,308
"Touch, come and touch me."

1116
01:56:57,210 --> 01:57:02,217
"Touch, come and touch me."

1117
01:57:02,297 --> 01:57:07,846
"Touch, come and touch me."

1118
01:57:08,140 --> 01:57:43,224
(Music)

1119
01:57:44,068 --> 01:57:51,107
"Don't leave me alone and go,
wait, tormentor!"

1120
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:58,697
"Or else I'll break
today by stretching myself!"

1121
01:57:59,232 --> 01:58:07,430
"Don't leave me alone and go,
wait, tormentor!"

1122
01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:12,786
"You've taken away my heart,
take my life too."

1123
01:58:12,866 --> 01:58:17,781
"Touch, come and touch me."

1124
01:58:17,861 --> 01:58:22,609
"Touch, come and touch me."

1125
01:58:22,923 --> 01:59:10,754
(Music)

1126
01:59:11,701 --> 01:59:14,362
"Who do I have besides you?"

1127
01:59:14,442 --> 01:59:18,040
"You're the king of my dreams!"

1128
01:59:19,448 --> 01:59:21,980
"Who do I have besides you?"

1129
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:25,125
"You're the king of my dreams!"

1130
01:59:26,810 --> 01:59:32,632
"Hold me in your eyes with love.
Come on."

1131
01:59:34,232 --> 01:59:39,663
"Don't break the heart of the bride,
my unfaithful groom!"

1132
01:59:39,743 --> 01:59:44,769
"Touch, come and touch me."

1133
01:59:44,849 --> 01:59:49,355
"Touch, come and touch me."

1134
01:59:49,435 --> 01:59:59,659
"My beauty, colour,
every part says, come touch me."

1135
01:59:59,739 --> 02:00:04,659
"Touch, come and touch me."

1136
02:00:06,218 --> 02:00:10,825
"Touch, come and touch me."

1137
02:00:11,213 --> 02:00:16,499
"Touch, come and touch me."

1138
02:00:16,775 --> 02:00:22,898
(Music)

1139
02:00:40,831 --> 02:00:41,809
(Slaps)

1140
02:00:46,046 --> 02:00:52,169
Hit me. Hit me more!
Vent all your hatred and anger on me.

1141
02:00:53,151 --> 02:00:56,062
But by killing someone, brother
and sister-in-law won't return, Sanju.

1142
02:00:58,152 --> 02:01:02,632
Swear on my love,
don't walk on this road to ruin.

1143
02:01:03,551 --> 02:01:04,617
Come back.

1144
02:01:11,635 --> 02:01:12,777
What madness is this?

1145
02:01:13,004 --> 02:01:16,139
- What if someone rapes you?
- Are you in your senses?

1146
02:01:16,219 --> 02:01:21,103
Answer me,
Jenny, what if someone rapes you?

1147
02:01:22,484 --> 02:01:25,293
- What'll you do?
- This can ever happen.

1148
02:01:25,373 --> 02:01:29,045
- If it happens, then?
- Then I'll kill him.

1149
02:01:31,714 --> 02:01:36,386
- If you're unable to kill him then?
- Then I'll kill myself.

1150
02:01:36,466 --> 02:01:38,365
That's why sister-in-law
killed herself.

1151
02:01:39,527 --> 02:01:42,211
Now I'll take lives.

1152
02:01:44,136 --> 02:01:47,051
I know, Jenny,
by committing these murders..

1153
02:01:47,131 --> 02:01:49,487
I'll turn into a criminal
in the eyes of the world and the law.

1154
02:01:50,398 --> 02:01:52,762
I'm aware of law's strength.

1155
02:01:53,688 --> 02:01:56,093
But before that I'll fulfil my oath.

1156
02:01:56,645 --> 02:01:58,833
And after that I
will surrender myself.

1157
02:02:24,965 --> 02:02:26,748
Nice very nice. Hi.

1158
02:02:28,730 --> 02:02:30,003
How are you?

1159
02:02:32,248 --> 02:02:33,542
O god!

1160
02:02:45,051 --> 02:02:47,123
He has descended from above!

1161
02:04:21,335 --> 02:04:26,328
The saying, from the frying
pan to the fire is true!

1162
02:05:23,026 --> 02:05:27,078
Maybe you have heard that proverb,
a dog's death..

1163
02:05:27,158 --> 02:05:30,554
..but this is goat's death.

1164
02:05:31,778 --> 02:05:36,742
(Music)

1165
02:06:25,151 --> 02:06:29,113
"Another one bites the dust!"

1166
02:06:29,193 --> 02:06:33,152
"Out of three,
one is gone, there are two pots left!"

1167
02:06:33,232 --> 02:06:35,202
"The second one has gone."

1168
02:06:42,890 --> 02:06:46,748
"Out of three one has gone.."

1169
02:06:46,828 --> 02:06:50,519
"Out of three, one has gone,
there are two pots left!"

1170
02:06:50,599 --> 02:06:54,350
"Another one bites the dust!"

1171
02:06:54,430 --> 02:06:56,836
"Out of three one has gone.."

1172
02:06:58,265 --> 02:07:02,076
"Out of three, one has gone,
there are two pots left!"

1173
02:07:02,156 --> 02:07:05,925
"Another one bites the dust!"

1174
02:07:06,005 --> 02:07:09,881
"Out of three, one has gone,
there are two pots left!"

1175
02:07:09,961 --> 02:07:13,715
"Another one bites the dust!"

1176
02:07:13,795 --> 02:07:17,533
"Out of three, one has gone,
there are two pots left!"

1177
02:07:18,139 --> 02:07:32,451
(Music)

1178
02:07:32,644 --> 02:07:36,621
"Again, a star has
fallen from the sky."

1179
02:07:36,701 --> 02:07:40,478
"Our enemy got killed."

1180
02:07:40,558 --> 02:07:44,375
"Again, a star has
fallen from the sky."

1181
02:07:44,455 --> 02:07:48,246
"Our enemy got killed."

1182
02:07:48,326 --> 02:07:52,165
"Our enemy was hung by the noose."

1183
02:07:52,245 --> 02:07:54,366
"Out of three, one has gone.."

1184
02:07:55,978 --> 02:07:59,780
"Out of three, one has gone,
there are two pots left!"

1185
02:07:59,860 --> 02:08:03,542
"Another one bites the dust."

1186
02:08:03,622 --> 02:08:07,679
"Out of three, one has gone,
there are two pots left!"

1187
02:08:25,572 --> 02:08:28,340
(Laughs)

1188
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:33,321
(Laughs)

1189
02:08:33,895 --> 02:08:38,477
Smarty, you're a lion
but you still need a tail.

1190
02:08:40,311 --> 02:08:46,708
The one who loses his senses,
is confused. Understood, Nanu?

1191
02:08:47,072 --> 02:08:48,797
Your cabaret was great.

1192
02:08:49,236 --> 02:08:52,931
Good you left the police
and became a musician. Good.

1193
02:08:53,863 --> 02:08:56,254
Nanu, when Sanju strikes someone..

1194
02:08:56,874 --> 02:09:00,292
..he doesn't live to
praise anyone again.

1195
02:09:01,921 --> 02:09:04,868
I'm not here to call you
for Dube's thirteenth day ritual.

1196
02:09:05,197 --> 02:09:09,404
I want to know which clarified
butter should I use on your pyre?

1197
02:09:09,949 --> 02:09:11,960
Pure or vegetable?

1198
02:09:12,399 --> 02:09:15,571
I think you enjoy tampering, frog.

1199
02:09:16,923 --> 02:09:20,822
By riding on these musicians
you've reached wall of the well..

1200
02:09:21,250 --> 02:09:23,200
..but don't stick your head out.

1201
02:09:23,855 --> 02:09:27,380
Because there's no
frog but a crocodile..

1202
02:09:27,851 --> 02:09:31,301
..which kills with its
tail more than its mouth.

1203
02:09:32,353 --> 02:09:35,730
In spite of croaking so much noise,
you're still alive.

1204
02:09:36,476 --> 02:09:37,916
There are three explanations for it.

1205
02:09:38,472 --> 02:09:41,121
Either Nanubhai
Chhatewala's not hungry.

1206
02:09:41,463 --> 02:09:44,695
Or I haven't told you the
place and time of your death.

1207
02:09:44,775 --> 02:09:49,108
Or you're lucky, as I forgot
to bring an umbrella today.

1208
02:10:01,338 --> 02:10:04,329
I'll even give you an opportunity
to fulfil this desire, Nanu.

1209
02:10:05,333 --> 02:10:10,857
You tell me the time and place
and I'll remind you of your umbrella.

1210
02:10:21,491 --> 02:10:25,422
Look at this,
they're spread all over the casino..

1211
02:10:25,502 --> 02:10:27,043
..as if it belongs to their father..

1212
02:10:27,123 --> 02:10:29,065
..and Nanu is their father's servant!

1213
02:10:29,145 --> 02:10:33,123
Sitting in air-conditioned comfort.
Do you feel hot going to work?

1214
02:10:33,203 --> 02:10:35,982
That fellow vented all
his heat on me and left!

1215
02:10:36,062 --> 02:10:38,522
What did he say?
He'll remind me to bring an umbrella!

1216
02:10:38,602 --> 02:10:40,475
- What did he say?
- Don't remember, boss!

1217
02:10:40,555 --> 02:10:44,400
Boss' brother-in-law,
what was he singing?

1218
02:10:44,480 --> 02:10:47,909
- "Gone away.."
- Shut up!

1219
02:10:47,989 --> 02:10:50,800
Tansen's son even remembers
the tune of the song but

1220
02:10:50,880 --> 02:10:53,262
doesn't remember his abuse! You..

1221
02:10:53,433 --> 02:10:56,882
It was his good luck
that Nanu hadn't had a drag.

1222
02:10:56,962 --> 02:10:59,163
You know what a drag is.

1223
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:03,812
If I had had two puffs,
I'd have fixed his death hour today!

1224
02:11:03,892 --> 02:11:07,900
He asked me the time and place!
He asked Nanu!

1225
02:11:08,278 --> 02:11:10,191
You know everything, Jenny.

1226
02:11:10,830 --> 02:11:13,046
Maheshnath's death could
have been an accident.

1227
02:11:13,397 --> 02:11:16,999
But Dube's death wasn't!

1228
02:11:17,451 --> 02:11:21,094
- The entire city witnessed his murder.
- How about your murder?

1229
02:11:21,402 --> 02:11:22,515
Is there no witness to that?

1230
02:11:23,748 --> 02:11:24,645
I?

1231
02:11:24,862 --> 02:11:28,721
With Kedarnath
you killed our trust.

1232
02:11:29,229 --> 02:11:30,602
There's no witness to that.

1233
02:11:31,229 --> 02:11:34,537
You arrested Sanju without any crime.
There's no witness to that!

1234
02:11:35,759 --> 02:11:37,575
When the elder brother tried to save..

1235
02:11:38,311 --> 02:11:40,549
..then friendship was forgotten.

1236
02:11:40,629 --> 02:11:42,170
There's no witness to that too!

1237
02:11:43,102 --> 02:11:44,667
When a mother-like sister-in-law..

1238
02:11:44,981 --> 02:11:48,798
..went to beg for her
children's happiness..

1239
02:11:49,565 --> 02:11:51,479
- ..she was raped!
- Jenny!

1240
02:11:51,559 --> 02:11:54,732
There's no witness to that either.
Isn't that what you had thought?

1241
02:11:54,948 --> 02:11:58,397
There's no witness on earth,
but there's one above.

1242
02:11:59,024 --> 02:12:02,127
There's a delay in his court
but no denial.

1243
02:12:02,921 --> 02:12:07,296
He strikes soundlessly
but the wound caused is deep.

1244
02:12:07,376 --> 02:12:09,722
When he passes judgement,
commissioner sir..

1245
02:12:09,933 --> 02:12:12,460
..no power in the world
will be able to save you!

1246
02:12:12,867 --> 02:12:16,068
This is your blind faith's tale!

1247
02:12:16,148 --> 02:12:20,041
This is not a tale it's the
testimony of Kedarnath himself!

1248
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:24,487
This was the gift for lighting
brother and sister-in-law's pyre.

1249
02:12:24,838 --> 02:12:29,311
From Kedarnath. What gift would
you like to give, commissioner sir?

1250
02:12:29,865 --> 02:12:31,622
Killing my husband?

1251
02:12:31,852 --> 02:12:35,744
Jenny, if Sanju is still alive..

1252
02:12:36,405 --> 02:12:38,347
..that's just because of me.

1253
02:12:39,621 --> 02:12:43,445
If he's still beyond the law,
that's just because of me.

1254
02:12:44,784 --> 02:12:50,230
If I hadn't arrested Sanju that night,
you'd have been a widow.

1255
02:12:50,310 --> 02:12:52,689
You wouldn't be wearing
this nuptial thread.

1256
02:12:52,769 --> 02:12:56,985
That night Kedarnath had given
Nanubhai a contract to kill Sanju!

1257
02:12:57,656 --> 02:13:02,534
Sanju got saved,
but I couldn't save my friend.

1258
02:13:02,614 --> 02:13:04,331
He was the witness to my innocence.

1259
02:13:05,278 --> 02:13:10,191
Sanju insulted me,
you disgraced me, but I kept quiet!

1260
02:13:10,271 --> 02:13:14,379
Only because I had promised Raj,
I had sworn on him..

1261
02:13:14,589 --> 02:13:18,891
..that I'd not tell this to Sanju,
or else he'd not leave Kedar alive!

1262
02:13:22,015 --> 02:13:25,063
That's it. That's my crime, Jenny.

1263
02:13:26,093 --> 02:13:30,444
My silence became a curse to me.

1264
02:13:32,498 --> 02:13:35,066
You've recently come as
a daughter-in-law in this house.

1265
02:13:35,429 --> 02:13:38,160
You've recently been introduced
to Raj and sister-in-law.

1266
02:13:38,852 --> 02:13:41,232
But my childhood and my past has gone.

1267
02:13:42,444 --> 02:13:44,698
You'll have thousands
to wipe your tears.

1268
02:13:45,729 --> 02:13:50,187
But no one kept a hand
of sympathy on my shoulders.

1269
02:13:50,972 --> 02:13:53,202
Who can be unluckier than me..

1270
02:13:53,713 --> 02:13:57,239
..who was hanged alive by his own?

1271
02:13:58,539 --> 02:14:03,305
Vijay brother,
I've seen Jesus on the cross..

1272
02:14:04,336 --> 02:14:07,004
..but for the first time
I've realized his suffering.

1273
02:14:08,633 --> 02:14:12,079
Forgive me, I misunderstood you.

1274
02:14:19,537 --> 02:14:23,452
'Raj, my friend, forgive me.'

1275
02:14:24,105 --> 02:14:27,821
'I broke your promise.'

1276
02:14:34,587 --> 02:14:35,345
Commissioner sir.

1277
02:14:37,757 --> 02:14:38,714
Sir!

1278
02:14:38,794 --> 02:14:41,728
Kelkar, you, over here?

1279
02:14:42,335 --> 02:14:44,646
Sir, now it's Nanubhai
Chhatewala's turn.

1280
02:14:45,038 --> 02:14:46,200
Sanju won't spare him.

1281
02:15:04,215 --> 02:15:07,215
- Kelkar, you!
- Yes sir, it was me.

1282
02:15:07,580 --> 02:15:11,904
You didn't show up till now,
why did you do all this secretly?

1283
02:15:12,332 --> 02:15:14,850
I've always seen
the uniform being sold.

1284
02:15:15,823 --> 02:15:18,080
When I was sure you
weren't one of them..

1285
02:15:18,383 --> 02:15:19,580
..then I came in front of you.

1286
02:15:20,512 --> 02:15:22,931
Sir, I had to give you
inspector Khan's belonging.

1287
02:15:23,580 --> 02:15:27,404
- Khan's belonging?
- Yes sir, this file.

1288
02:15:29,702 --> 02:15:32,189
It contains all crimes
committed by Kedarnath.

1289
02:15:32,850 --> 02:15:37,363
Kelkar, I wish all officers
of this police force were like you.

1290
02:15:38,026 --> 02:15:39,539
I'm proud of you.

1291
02:15:40,229 --> 02:15:44,654
I'll surely get you awarded for this.

1292
02:15:45,229 --> 02:15:48,532
Just utilize this belonging, sir.
I'll get my reward.

1293
02:15:59,513 --> 02:16:03,296
Kedarnath, now you're trapped.

1294
02:16:03,579 --> 02:16:05,539
Search every nook
and corner of the city.

1295
02:16:05,755 --> 02:16:08,823
I want Kedarnath and
Nanubhai at any cost!

1296
02:16:08,903 --> 02:16:11,214
No excuse! They have to be caught.

1297
02:16:11,294 --> 02:16:13,159
Kedar sir, what's happening?

1298
02:16:13,376 --> 02:16:16,160
That commissioner is
after my life like a mad dog!

1299
02:16:16,240 --> 02:16:19,536
Explain to him,
or I'll make him a constable!

1300
02:16:19,616 --> 02:16:21,190
The commissioner sir has put his..

1301
02:16:21,270 --> 02:16:23,104
..entire police force at the
dens of Kedarnath and Nanubhai.

1302
02:16:23,232 --> 02:16:26,444
He'll not let us
reach them at any cost.

1303
02:16:26,524 --> 02:16:29,795
When the police commissioner
is helping them, what can we do?

1304
02:16:30,433 --> 02:16:32,466
We can kill the commissioner.

1305
02:16:50,742 --> 02:16:52,648
Stop, Sanju, swear on me!

1306
02:16:52,728 --> 02:16:55,356
If any oath stands blocks my way..

1307
02:16:55,862 --> 02:16:57,998
..then I'll get rid of it, Jenny.

1308
02:16:58,078 --> 02:17:00,670
You've gone crazy!
I'll not let you go.

1309
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:03,261
Don't block my way, Jenny, move aside!

1310
02:17:04,702 --> 02:17:06,673
If Vijay brother and
sister-in-law are harmed..

1311
02:17:06,753 --> 02:17:08,115
..I'll kill myself!

1312
02:17:18,391 --> 02:17:20,263
You're sacrificing
your life for those..

1313
02:17:20,876 --> 02:17:23,164
..who caused brother
and sister-in-law's deaths.

1314
02:17:23,449 --> 02:17:26,638
Those who want to kill your husband!

1315
02:17:26,718 --> 02:17:27,881
Enough, Sanju.

1316
02:17:28,189 --> 02:17:30,220
You're blinded by the fire of revenge.

1317
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:32,554
- You can't see the truth.
- What's the truth?

1318
02:17:32,972 --> 02:17:35,513
When you know it, you'll be stunned.

1319
02:17:38,592 --> 02:17:41,766
If he hadn't arrested
you on our wedding night..

1320
02:17:41,846 --> 02:17:45,332
..I'd be wearing neither the
vermilion nor the nuptial thread!

1321
02:17:46,180 --> 02:17:50,335
Because Kedarnath sir had given
Nanubhai a contract to kill you!

1322
02:17:55,800 --> 02:17:59,955
By saving you from Kedarnath and Nanu,
Vijay brother saved your life.

1323
02:18:00,035 --> 02:18:03,748
The law hasn't caught up with you,
only because of Vijay brother.

1324
02:18:03,828 --> 02:18:07,190
The person whom you want
to kill is saving your life!

1325
02:18:25,531 --> 02:18:27,943
If this is the reward
for his greatness then go..

1326
02:18:28,023 --> 02:18:30,351
..pump all six bullets into his chest.

1327
02:18:30,431 --> 02:18:31,571
Enough Jenny.

1328
02:18:33,661 --> 02:18:34,947
What have I done!

1329
02:18:36,520 --> 02:18:38,423
I lit the funeral pyre of one brother.

1330
02:18:39,589 --> 02:18:42,557
I killed the other,
even when he was alive!

1331
02:18:49,134 --> 02:18:52,499
- Where is commissioner sir?
- He's at home.

1332
02:18:54,137 --> 02:18:56,094
- May I make a phone call?
- Make it.

1333
02:18:58,673 --> 02:18:59,455
(Phone rings)

1334
02:19:00,127 --> 02:19:00,699
Hello.

1335
02:19:01,174 --> 02:19:04,921
Commissioner Vijay Kapoor,
this is Kedarnath!

1336
02:19:06,395 --> 02:19:11,990
Still sitting in the office
and collecting evidence against me!

1337
02:19:13,186 --> 02:19:18,767
Saw how cleverly I shifted
your duty to my area?

1338
02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:21,610
From where my Ganpati will depart.

1339
02:19:22,849 --> 02:19:26,973
I'm telling you all this,
commissioner Vijay Kapoor..

1340
02:19:27,788 --> 02:19:31,300
..as Kedarnath sir is
really a hunter of the lion.

1341
02:19:31,852 --> 02:19:36,443
He always alerts
his prey then kills him.

1342
02:19:37,365 --> 02:19:39,494
I've have set the trap..

1343
02:19:40,486 --> 02:19:45,610
..and you're my prey,
commissioner Vijay Kapoor!

1344
02:19:46,837 --> 02:19:49,078
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1345
02:19:51,098 --> 02:19:52,943
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1346
02:19:53,023 --> 02:19:56,105
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1347
02:19:56,638 --> 02:20:02,166
(Music)

1348
02:21:20,441 --> 02:21:22,667
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1349
02:21:22,747 --> 02:21:24,863
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1350
02:21:31,276 --> 02:21:34,844
"Hail! Lord Ganesh!"

1351
02:21:34,924 --> 02:21:42,598
"Lord Ganesh bless this world."

1352
02:21:42,678 --> 02:21:48,900
"Lord Ganesh bless this world."

1353
02:21:50,326 --> 02:21:54,170
"You know everything,
we're all unaware."

1354
02:21:54,250 --> 02:22:02,019
"Who is good, who is bad amongst us,
you know everyone!"

1355
02:22:02,099 --> 02:22:08,739
"Lord Ganesh bless this world."

1356
02:22:21,539 --> 02:22:24,627
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1357
02:22:24,707 --> 02:22:26,534
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1358
02:22:26,614 --> 02:22:28,795
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1359
02:22:59,076 --> 02:23:00,976
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1360
02:23:01,056 --> 02:23:03,134
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1361
02:23:03,214 --> 02:23:05,209
Hail! Lord Ganesh!

1362
02:23:06,582 --> 02:23:14,275
"Colours change! Forms change!"

1363
02:23:14,355 --> 02:23:18,309
"Colours change! Forms change!"

1364
02:23:18,389 --> 02:23:22,239
"They seem something else
and are something else altogether!"

1365
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:26,210
"They seem something else
and are something else altogether!"

1366
02:23:26,290 --> 02:23:28,061
"Something else altogether!"

1367
02:23:28,141 --> 02:23:33,919
"Everyone is an impostor!"

1368
02:23:33,999 --> 02:23:40,547
"Lord Ganesh bless this world."

1369
02:23:56,996 --> 02:24:00,752
"Hail lord Ganesh."

1370
02:24:00,832 --> 02:24:02,821
"Hail lord Ganesh."

1371
02:24:04,384 --> 02:24:08,266
"Hail lord Ganesh."

1372
02:24:08,346 --> 02:24:12,188
"Hail lord Ganesh."

1373
02:24:12,268 --> 02:24:16,192
"They worship you in the open."

1374
02:24:16,272 --> 02:24:20,104
"Hail lord Ganesh."

1375
02:24:20,184 --> 02:24:24,030
"But their real
intentions are different!"

1376
02:24:24,110 --> 02:24:27,871
"Hail lord Ganesh."

1377
02:24:27,951 --> 02:24:31,798
"They disrespect your veneration."

1378
02:24:31,878 --> 02:24:38,161
"Lord Ganesh bless this world."

1379
02:24:38,241 --> 02:24:42,454
"Hail lord Ganesh."

1380
02:24:42,534 --> 02:24:46,183
"Hail lord Ganesh."

1381
02:24:49,569 --> 02:24:54,780
(Music)

1382
02:25:49,404 --> 02:25:50,400
(Gunshot)

1383
02:25:52,209 --> 02:25:53,476
Run!

1384
02:25:53,791 --> 02:25:54,704
(Gunshot)

1385
02:26:10,224 --> 02:26:11,355
Get down! (Gunshot)

1386
02:26:11,435 --> 02:26:12,747
Everyone get down.

1387
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:16,354
(Gunshot)

1388
02:26:40,757 --> 02:26:44,099
Hail Lord Ganesh!

1389
02:26:44,179 --> 02:26:48,589
Hail Lord Ganesh!

1390
02:26:49,860 --> 02:26:51,589
(Footsteps approach)

1391
02:27:43,012 --> 02:27:44,266
Kill him!

1392
02:27:44,614 --> 02:27:46,869
(Rapid gunfire)

1393
02:28:09,763 --> 02:28:14,046
(Rapid gunfire)

1394
02:28:15,053 --> 02:28:15,819
I think he's dead.

1395
02:28:15,899 --> 02:28:17,037
- Let's go and see.
- Come.

1396
02:28:32,933 --> 02:28:34,732
(Rapid gunfire)

1397
02:28:43,357 --> 02:28:44,558
(Rapid gunfire)

1398
02:28:46,573 --> 02:28:50,714
Get out! If you have guts!

1399
02:28:53,848 --> 02:28:56,860
You rat!

1400
02:29:00,342 --> 02:29:03,818
Come out if you have the guts!

1401
02:29:05,188 --> 02:29:07,296
Come out if you have the guts!

1402
02:29:08,335 --> 02:29:10,010
Come out!

1403
02:29:12,518 --> 02:29:14,946
Your enemy is here! Come!

1404
02:29:17,497 --> 02:29:22,092
You challenge Nanubhai Chhatewala!
Come here, scum!

1405
02:29:22,172 --> 02:29:23,486
Today, I'll..

1406
02:29:26,704 --> 02:29:28,996
You gave me the time and place, Nanu.

1407
02:29:29,517 --> 02:29:31,264
Now I'll give you an umbrella.

1408
02:31:07,474 --> 02:31:08,228
(Screams)

1409
02:31:13,687 --> 02:31:19,672
Nanu I will kill you in your style.

1410
02:31:48,849 --> 02:31:49,930
(Screams)

1411
02:31:52,443 --> 02:31:54,009
(Screams)

1412
02:31:55,064 --> 02:31:56,716
(Screams)

1413
02:32:13,533 --> 02:32:15,450
Please forgive me.

1414
02:32:30,402 --> 02:32:34,574
(Phone rings)

1415
02:32:37,577 --> 02:32:40,475
- Hello.
- I'm Nanu speaking.

1416
02:32:40,555 --> 02:32:41,757
Yes Nanu.

1417
02:32:41,837 --> 02:32:43,059
From where are you calling?

1418
02:32:43,139 --> 02:32:49,058
I'm calling from where your
victim is trying his last leaps!

1419
02:32:49,949 --> 02:32:54,247
I thought I'd ask before killing,
what's the price for this game?

1420
02:32:54,710 --> 02:32:57,139
Whatever you want, Nanu.

1421
02:32:57,845 --> 02:33:01,207
- But don't kill Sanju there.
- Yes.

1422
02:33:01,287 --> 02:33:03,937
You'll kill Sanju at the same place..

1423
02:33:04,169 --> 02:33:07,943
..where he threatened
to kill Kedarnath.

1424
02:33:08,492 --> 02:33:11,413
You'll kill him there, in front of me.

1425
02:33:20,927 --> 02:33:21,841
(Tires squealing)

1426
02:33:31,147 --> 02:33:32,250
Nanu!

1427
02:33:32,740 --> 02:33:36,455
Then who spoke to me on the phone?

1428
02:33:37,347 --> 02:33:40,156
(Band playing)

1429
02:34:15,494 --> 02:34:19,650
"Another one bites the dust."

1430
02:34:19,730 --> 02:34:23,798
"Out of two, one is gone,
there's only one pot left!"

1431
02:34:23,878 --> 02:34:26,106
"The third one is gone."

1432
02:34:33,623 --> 02:34:37,490
"Another one bites the dust."

1433
02:34:37,570 --> 02:34:39,752
"One of two is gone.."

1434
02:34:41,273 --> 02:34:45,052
"Out of two, one is gone,
there's only one pot left!"

1435
02:34:45,132 --> 02:34:48,956
"Another one bites the dust."

1436
02:34:49,036 --> 02:34:52,829
"Out of two, one is gone,
there's only one pot left!"

1437
02:34:52,909 --> 02:34:56,707
"Another one bites the dust."

1438
02:34:56,787 --> 02:35:00,634
"Out of two, one is gone,
there's only one pot left!"

1439
02:35:00,893 --> 02:35:15,305
(Music)

1440
02:35:15,963 --> 02:35:19,864
"Now it's your turn,
don't get scared."

1441
02:35:19,944 --> 02:35:23,757
"Don't die before your own death."

1442
02:35:23,837 --> 02:35:27,582
"Now it's your turn,
don't get scared."

1443
02:35:27,662 --> 02:35:31,517
"Don't die before your own death."

1444
02:35:31,597 --> 02:35:35,275
"Your life is stuck on your lips."

1445
02:35:35,355 --> 02:35:38,118
"Out of two, one is gone."

1446
02:35:39,184 --> 02:35:43,019
"Out of two, one is gone,
there's only one pot left!"

1447
02:35:43,099 --> 02:35:46,771
"Another one bites the dust."

1448
02:35:46,851 --> 02:35:50,401
"Out of two, one is gone,
there's only one pot left!"

1449
02:35:56,921 --> 02:35:58,712
(Panting)

1450
02:35:58,981 --> 02:36:00,495
Is anyone there?

1451
02:36:02,623 --> 02:36:04,403
Is no one there?

1452
02:36:05,106 --> 02:36:10,284
- Where's everyone?
- None will listen to you, Kedarnath!

1453
02:36:11,484 --> 02:36:14,240
Look all around you carefully!

1454
02:36:14,495 --> 02:36:16,482
After today there's
no heir nor will there be..

1455
02:36:16,562 --> 02:36:20,232
..an owner of Kedar
Shipping Corporation.

1456
02:36:21,563 --> 02:36:24,945
All the rats of this ship have jumped,
Kedarnath.

1457
02:36:25,377 --> 02:36:27,148
It's your turn now!

1458
02:36:35,924 --> 02:36:39,995
Forgive me, Sanju dear.

1459
02:36:47,850 --> 02:36:50,622
Look carefully at this sari,
Kedarnath.

1460
02:36:51,112 --> 02:36:56,213
Spreading its veil, my sister-in-law
asked you to spare my life.

1461
02:36:56,412 --> 02:36:59,008
- Did she or didn't she?
- Yes.

1462
02:36:59,733 --> 02:37:01,601
(Groans)

1463
02:37:03,109 --> 02:37:06,559
Where was she standing?

1464
02:37:12,580 --> 02:37:15,060
- Here.
- How was she pleading?

1465
02:37:15,969 --> 02:37:17,141
Tell me!

1466
02:37:20,803 --> 02:37:26,457
'Today I've not come as Sanju's
sister-in-law but as a mother..'

1467
02:37:26,537 --> 02:37:27,713
'..with hopes.'

1468
02:37:28,194 --> 02:37:31,248
'A helpless woman
with her hands extended..'

1469
02:37:31,451 --> 02:37:34,086
'..is begging you for
her children's happiness.'

1470
02:37:38,247 --> 02:37:43,331
Now you beg for your life
in the same manner, Kedarnath!

1471
02:37:44,883 --> 02:37:49,396
I beg for mercy, forgive me, Sanju.

1472
02:37:55,059 --> 02:37:56,828
Run, Kedar.

1473
02:37:57,426 --> 02:38:01,536
In the same manner, by the
route that my sister-in-law ran!

1474
02:38:02,438 --> 02:38:06,075
Run, or I'll give you
a dog's death, scum!

1475
02:38:18,125 --> 02:38:20,653
Don't change the route, Kedarnath!

1476
02:38:51,219 --> 02:38:54,165
Look carefully at these doors,
Kedarnath!

1477
02:38:54,801 --> 02:38:59,620
Till yesterday they opened
and closed at your command.

1478
02:38:59,882 --> 02:39:05,882
Now they closed at my command.
They'll also open at my command.

1479
02:39:05,962 --> 02:39:10,665
Forgive me, Sanju dear.
I beg for my life!

1480
02:39:10,745 --> 02:39:15,126
Even my sister-in-law begged
for my life, did she or didn't she?

1481
02:39:15,788 --> 02:39:17,355
- Yes.
- Then?

1482
02:39:18,464 --> 02:39:21,279
I raped..

1483
02:40:04,451 --> 02:40:05,827
(Flush starts)

1484
02:40:13,995 --> 02:40:17,359
Scum, you'll not die here.

1485
02:40:18,172 --> 02:40:21,147
Before dying you'll
tell me the place where..

1486
02:40:21,435 --> 02:40:24,028
..my brother and sister-in-law died.

1487
02:40:24,271 --> 02:40:25,203
Tell me!

1488
02:40:26,507 --> 02:40:27,298
Run.

1489
02:41:00,330 --> 02:41:03,678
Tell me,
Kedarnath, which was that place?

1490
02:41:05,260 --> 02:41:06,459
Tell me!

1491
02:41:23,756 --> 02:41:25,119
Shanti.

1492
02:41:59,064 --> 02:42:02,467
(Band playing)

1493
02:42:02,690 --> 02:42:05,737
'Are your friends
are dancing for your joy..'

1494
02:42:06,396 --> 02:42:08,177
'..or celebrating your ruin?'

1495
02:42:08,872 --> 02:42:11,007
'When will this dance
of death end, Sanju?'

1496
02:42:11,422 --> 02:42:13,854
'Will you be able to crush
your conscience and dance?'

1497
02:42:44,963 --> 02:42:48,947
"Another one bites the dust."

1498
02:42:49,027 --> 02:42:52,934
"Four out of four are gone,
now break these pots!"

1499
02:42:53,014 --> 02:42:55,053
"The fourth one has gone."

1500
02:43:02,669 --> 02:43:06,449
"Another one bites the dust."

1501
02:43:06,529 --> 02:43:08,847
"Four out of four are gone.."

1502
02:43:10,343 --> 02:43:14,123
"Four out of four are gone,
now break these pots!"

1503
02:43:14,203 --> 02:43:17,972
"Another one bites the dust."

1504
02:43:18,052 --> 02:43:22,046
"Four out of four are gone,
now break these pots!"

1505
02:43:37,453 --> 02:43:41,431
"The four of them killed our friends."

1506
02:43:41,511 --> 02:43:45,444
"Our friends got together
and killed four of them."

1507
02:43:45,524 --> 02:43:49,278
"The four of them killed our friends."

1508
02:43:49,358 --> 02:43:53,319
"Our friends got together
and killed four of them."

1509
02:43:53,399 --> 02:43:57,255
"No one has been left."

1510
02:43:57,335 --> 02:43:59,914
"Four out of four are gone.."

1511
02:44:00,630 --> 02:44:04,848
"Four out of four are gone,
now break these pots!"

1512
02:44:04,928 --> 02:44:08,893
"Another one bites the dust."

1513
02:44:08,973 --> 02:44:12,388
"Four out of four are gone,
now break these pots!"

1514
02:44:12,468 --> 02:44:13,419
(Pot smashed)

1515
02:44:13,744 --> 02:44:14,609
(Gunshot)

1516
02:44:31,511 --> 02:44:32,252
(Gunshot)

1517
02:44:34,709 --> 02:44:35,518
(Gunshot)

1518
02:44:44,984 --> 02:44:45,960
Ambulance!

1519
02:44:46,279 --> 02:44:48,749
(Ambulance siren wails)

1520
02:45:02,396 --> 02:45:10,492
(Mouth organ playing)

1521
02:45:31,151 --> 02:45:41,245
"I thought of my friend, as my enemy."

1522
02:45:43,153 --> 02:45:52,511
"What should I do, I was crazy."

1523
02:45:58,484 --> 02:46:04,065
"I thought of my friend, as my enemy."

1524
02:46:04,145 --> 02:46:12,174
"What should I do, I was crazy."

1525
02:46:16,991 --> 02:46:19,940
"Embrace me."

1526
02:46:24,100 --> 02:46:29,730
"Embrace me and make me hear
my friend's song."

1527
02:47:00,778 --> 02:47:06,256
"Without you what am I?
What am I without you?"

1528
02:47:06,336 --> 02:47:11,879
"Without you what am I?
What am I without you?"

1529
02:47:11,959 --> 02:47:16,220
"I won't see the day
when I don't meet you!"
