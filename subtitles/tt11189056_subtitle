Yup, So… what do you guys think…?

2
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,180
Well, to be honest, this looks more interesting to me. And similar at the same time,

00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,920
like che guvera,Bhagat singh.

4
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,860
Ya ya.. it is kind of…!

5
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,820
Do you think these photos and videos are enough to make your film ? and why specifically him ?

6
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,900
Him because…I already wanted to explore the subject.

7
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,560
And also have some memories of my granny talking about george. So…!

8
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,660

00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,760
You Might ?, how can you be so reckless muskan.

11
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,920
So what's the point you are trying to say. You said it got deleted from google.

12
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,460
Do you think he will cooperate and give you the information?

13
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,560
Sir, am going to india , not china, i can deal with it.

14
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,000
So that, why do you want to take a chance to your final project. Think about it.

The Boat got delayed.

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:12,820
Your boat is late everyday? Go and stand on your knees.

40
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,580
Whoever is late will have to do the same.

41
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,020
9*1. Who knows this?

42
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,660
Whoever knows, stand-up and answer 
No one? So,no one knows the multiplcation table of 9?

43
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,240

86
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,220
George reddy

87
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,000
Mother

88
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,440
Who is this?

89
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
Bhagath singh.

90
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,640
Now where is he?

91
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,520
He is killed

92
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,540

93
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,860
death will come only once in life

94
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,740
Da, look. count the skippings. give me

95
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,060
Dude!...

96
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:25,640
Huh?...

97
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:26,640
Come here..!

98
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:27,700

99
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,760
Oh my leg, Mom!!

100
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,320
George.

101
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,780
Mom

102
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,780
ya George..

103
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:10,260
Why stone sinks and but not boat?

104
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:14,220
when god is only one, why so many temples?

105
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,040
Where does sun go at night?

106
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,080
why stars and moon are moving?

107
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,860
Earth rotates in a circular motion, so do we.

108
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,680
then why our eyes are not rotating?

109
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,380
Mom, what do you do when you are scared of darkness?

110
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,900
George hold this

111
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,660
Ok ready, I am rolling..!

112
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,880
Your article was deleted, you did not tell me why it was deleted ? Why was it blocked on social media..?

113
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:54,280
I didn’t delete it. Someone blocked it.

114
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,700
Some one blocked it..?

115
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,780
So, that is the fear of people.

116
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,420
Yes that's what

117
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:02,360
Weren’t you scared? Why aren’t you scared? Shouldn’t you be scared?

118
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:02,880
Me?

119
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,380
Why not…?

120
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,860
Why should I be afraid of them, they should be afraid

121
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,400
ok then, Just give me whatever you have of George. Show me what do you have?

122
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,880
This is George Reddy's shirt

123
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,720
When my grand father visited my father in college, George gave him a shirt because he doesn’t have one.

124
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,900
These are George Reddy's glasses.

125
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,040
Do you know something, Madam.

126
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,620
George Reddy used to sit in university library and read hundreds and thousands of books with these glasses.

127
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,520
look at this, watch it once, Madam!

128
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,520
George reddy wore it.

129
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,700
And ya… how did your father meet George…?

130
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,200

00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,160
How can I meet these people…?

136
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,880
I will take you to them.

137
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,440
Check out these girls, they look hot!

138
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,800
Are you going to college?

139
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,180

What do you say? Do you want to go & have some fun?

145
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,540

Will you tutor me? What do you say? We will go sit in the garden and study

148
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
What do you want?

149
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,580

155
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,360

00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,400
-Aaa! 
-He's my brother

167
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,860
Raghu, Double Ph.D

168
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:41,840
What are you reading?

169
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,160
I have a physics exam tomorrow, studying for that

170
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,780
Did your mother make these? They're amazing

171
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,460
How's mother, dada? 
-She's good.

172
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:55,000
-Hey, save some for me. 
-I'm also like a brother to you, am I not?

173
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,640
This is why I like him, dada.

174
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,000

00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,640
he's got lots of respect for me and my guests

178
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,860
Arey Dasthagiri, this isn't respect

179
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,760
Who would be in a mood to study after listening to my snore and looking at your face?

180
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,560
Keep quiet bro. 
Bro, come sleep here, I'll sleep on the floor

181
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:37,360
Even I thought I could see the world looking outside the window. Later I realized, I only get irritated by it.

182
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,180
Enough, come and sleep

183
00:15:51,040 --> 00:16:34,020
*Chanting*

184
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:42,440
Bharat Maatha Ki 
-Jai

185
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,060
My friends and fellow students

186
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
For the third time

187
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,800
Thank you so much for electing me

188
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,840
I am proud to say,

189
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,240
Hindustan is my country

190
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,080
Some people infiltrated our country

191
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,460
We accepted them with love

192
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,880
We fed them along with ourselves and gave them equal rights. But,

193
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,580
Now they're saying you're different and we're different.

194
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,740
The cultures and traditions of our country are being stabbed to death

195
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,120
After releasing the knots of slavery our country had for generations;

196
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,240
The neighboring dogs..

197
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:36,000
The neighboring dogs, have eyed on our motherland.

198
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,120
You dogs, trying to ruin the economical status of my country

199
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,600
Be careful

200
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,860
If you have the guts

201
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:50,860
Come face us for just two hours. 
Then we'll accept that you are all men.

202
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,660
All the incompetent leaders, ignoring this,

203
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,320
Your ruling has come to an end.

204
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,940
We are the rulers for the future generations

205
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,680
Let's show the true colors of this nation

206
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:14,080
My fellow students, who are born here, living here, fighting here for the nation. Get ready for the battle.

207
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,800
Bharat Maatha Ki 
-Jai

208
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,340
Sit down

209
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,580
Dear students,

210
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,580
A lawyer, A scientist, A police officer

211
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,380
A political leader

212
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,180
All the thoughts on how to take this nation forward,

213
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,460
Starts from this university

214
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,060
There is no compulsion of education here.

215
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,720
He said the same thing last year that there is no need to come to college

216
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,420
He will fail you, if he listen to this stuff

217
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,020
Let's talk about this person today

218
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,080
He is... Albert Einstein

219
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,400
Do you know Einstein?

220
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:45,900
Don't you know?

221
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,120
Guess no one knows

222
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,120
Dasthagiri... Stand up....

223
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:50,640
Sir..

224
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,200
Will You solve This…?

225
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,440
Anybody else….?

226
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,580
Come..!

227
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,220
I will continue tomorrow sir..!

228
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,240
Ok. Please carry on.

229
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,520
What is your name..?

230
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,860
George Reddy...

231
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,800
Good luck..!

232
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:47,860
Thank you sir.

233
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,160
George tell me this is your second time in M.Sc. right?

234
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,080
Hey, no dude.

235
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,600
I was in seventh grade for 3 years, I used to answer everything back them

236
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,260
People used to say I am good at studies too

237
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,500
Who is that stupid guy?

238
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,720
I will pull your teeth out, I'm telling you... I'm your senior dude

239
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,060
Who? you? senior? 
Yes...!

240
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,920
We sit beside each other, you say you are a senior

241
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,420
Don't let anyone know this, they will spit on your face, it will be a shame

242
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,260
Don't you have some dignity in you, seniors will be like this.

243
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,740
But brother, you did a wonderful job with the problem

244
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,460
Yeah! you did a wonderful job!

245
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,280
Campus didn't change much... why are you showing me around from the morning

246
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,860
What did you eat... Moped is not at all moving forward

247
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,540
Leave my food out... what happened? did you loose something?

248
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,280
Hey listen, where do people sit and time pass here!

249
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,700
Where else...there will be near that chai place

250
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,980
What happened? you taking me around, tell me when i ask you?

251
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,300
Song Playing

252
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,600
You're right. What you did is absolutely right!

253
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,140
After a long time I'm seeing some courage being born inside you

254
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:56,920
The other day, we found a cockroach in the rice. Do you know?

255
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,600
How long should we tolerate this? We're done tolerating this

256
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,860
We can't take this any longer!

257
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,100
Why did you throw your plate in the first place?

258
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,880
Yeah, man! It was great. 
-Useless fellow, change the song, please.

259
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,340
We can't change the song, man. We listen to what it plays

260
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,620
Koushik has been humiliated by everyone in the ladies hostel

261
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,220
Rajanna is announcing something!

262
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,040
Shameful!

263
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,600
Stop the song, man!

264
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,860
Listen to me sing now

265
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,880
Yes, that's the way.

266
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,680
Go for it!

267
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,020
It wasn't the men who were insulted here. It was Koushik's group

268
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,240
Rey, a girl threw her plate at you and you're still moving around shamelessly in the campus!

269
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,100
If a woman throws her plate at a man, it symbolizes the loss of your manhood! Shameful

270
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,960
You're absolutely right!

271
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:00,900
Raja, hold on!

272
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,840
These girls are going to kick your teeth out, if you ever think of the canteen lease.

273
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,700
Look at what they're saying about us.

274
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,880
The short one is talking trash! If we leave him...

275
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,380
Get him....

276
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,780
Shame on all of you! Thoo!

277
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,860
What did you say? Get him! Get him!

278
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,300
Let's go.

279
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,220
You hit us if we ask for good food! Come hold my ****

280
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:58,520
Dada, campus is for everyone… but only some are getting quality food in the canteen.

281
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,440
Okay..

282
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,320
This is our hostel canteen dada...! We have a food every day here.

283
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,320
Get up...!

284
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:04,940
Yaa give

285
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,040
Hey Raajanna is sitting. come on.

286
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,600
Guys, bring me some salt..! 
-OK brother.

287
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,640
when did you come dude..?

288
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,060
why are you so silent..?

289
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,840
Every piece of trash is eaten in these plates. Clean them properly.

290
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,860
Raajanna, dada.

291
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,700
Gave the lands beside cemetary… what are you doing here..?

292
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,300
You don't have porridge to have in your house, you want meals..

293
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,540
Dude, throw that dog food at them.

294
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,140
Dude, what happened, in this condition...?

295
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,600
Dude, what is this food... 
why this difference..?

296
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,800
because we are poor? what is this dude? 
why this difference between them and us?

297
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,920
why they are serving with a cloth?

298
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,640
Are we untouchable?

299
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,640
what are they assaulting us for? For howmany days are they gonna do this..?

300
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,940
They're shameless even after women spat on them.

301
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,480
What is this dude? See how bad they beat me up, just because I've asked them back.

302
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,080
These guys are cleaning all the plates that we ate on with salt..?

303
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,380
Eat, After you're done, we will clean those plates with our piss... !

304
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,120
what did you say..? Are you not happy with what happened..?

305
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,020
Brother, Beat them up! Beat them! Beat them...!

306
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,260
Wow, You beating him and he is falling,that too with a pappad..!

307
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,600
Eat! Eat! Eat! I'll clean it up with salt, you piece of trash… I'll clean them with salt.

308
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:23,040
You all ten people fight one guy..!? Pieces of trash.

309
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:49,780
You beat them all up.. Manipal Reddy

310
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,040
George Reddy

311
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,800
Brother, will you have some water

312
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Piece of Trash. Here in campus, we always had all the subjects,

313
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,860
I thought we didn't have beating up people who have done wrong… it started today.

314
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,620
Brother, see they're over looking from that wall.

315
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,640
Who's that...?

316
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,840
There's no one there…! hahaha

317
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:15,020
You piece of trash… ha ha ha

318
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,160
What Kaushik, how are you?

319
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,320
what's up?

320
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,020
We have a problem in the campus, sir..!

321
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,900
What's new, all the same...!

322
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,020
Murthy.....sir...Ask for a chai...!

323

Hey...202...Chai for sir, Yes sir.

324
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,180
Just a while ago someone beat our guys in the hostel.

325
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,940
Did you guys fight..? Who beat you...?

326
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,080
Some new guy sir...his name is... George...

327
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,060
George Reddy.

328
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,180
George Reddy...!

329
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,360
Yes sir... That satya's men started talking non sense with my men.

330
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,480
My men beat up his men. He came and beat us up.

331
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,900
Why are you nagging...Tell me properly.

332
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,860
He threatened him...he beat him...

333
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,540
We want you take some legal action sir.

334
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,580
He will threaten you, you beat them.You threaten them, they will beat you.

335
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,960
I'll take the compliant but.. but day before your guys came to me after a fight...

336
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,460
I made them sit for half an hour. they compromised & left.

337
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,460
you guys will be fine, but we become idiots.

338
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,500
I will not take this complaint back sir.

339
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:38,000
Okay...will fry someone up...but only when I'm done with the enquiry...! okay...?

340
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,020

Please take care of our people. okay sir.

342
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,300
Gentle remainder about the stadium. Please think about it once.

343
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,860
Once again I will talk to you personally.

344
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,700
Brother, they're having a fight again in the canteen.

345
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,820
They held my collar for saying that the food tastes bad!

346
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,860
they are being rude even though they're wrong.

347
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,740
who? that Kaushik gang?

348
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,380
Yes brother.

349
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,680
He won't change brother, He won't change!

350
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,440
Not one or two, three, four years have passed by, but he didn't change.

351
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,200
To stop them we have to do something. There's no other way.

352
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,280
Where is Koushik?

353
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,480
I'm coming from there Satya, he and his gang ran away.

354
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,840
Arjun, shut the university down. Shut the VC room too if necessary.

355
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,200
Did you beat him?

356
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,320
Yes sir.

357
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,500
Murthy.

358
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,740
Make him sit here all night and send him off in the morning.

359
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,560
okay sir.

360
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,200
Go. Take all their signatures.

361
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:39,940
Okay sir.

362
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,520
Let's go.

363
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,580
Don't leave a class. Don't leave a block.

364
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,460
Dude, shut down all the classes.

365
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:03,420
Get out.

366
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:05,780
Dude, Go there.

367
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,740
Okay Arjun.

368
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,220
So, today we are going to start.

369
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,620
Greetings sir.

370
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,040
Greetings sir…!

371
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,380
Who are these guys?

372
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,040
You'll know after sometime.

373
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,020
Friends.., There is no problem if we get a grain of wheat in rice, we can take that out.

374
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:27,240
But, if we have insects! do you want us to eat that..?

375
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:34,140
Maaya, a girl threw her food to the ground, that bad is the position of Koushik's canteen.

376
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,600
Canteen Permission for someone who can't feed proper food.

377
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,880
He supports him because he gave him permission, They both support the one on the top.

378
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:47,040
as long as acts like these by poeple like them happen, this country won't change!

379
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,620
Even the word will get polluted.

380
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:55,500
Let's shut the classes off! Don't fear anyone. I am there for you.

381
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,580
Do you guys understand? these guys are Satya's men.

382
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,180
I use to come here for men till now.

383
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:06,100
Now I came first time for women.

384
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,420
Look, someone's going in. Look. You! Get out!.

385
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,640
Dude, There's no college, Get out.

386
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:16,140
What a college is this? All this fight for throwing a plate?

387
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,800
Thank god, if this would have happend at the time of election,

388
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,320
the whole campus would be in the lock down mode!

389
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,460
Did they come here to study? or fight?

390
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,400
Why are you asking me? go and ask them.

391
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,960
I'll ask them. That's why I'm going.

392
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,240
What are you doing?

393
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,380
You want me to leave my studies here..?

394
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,000
Half of our studies are happening under the tress. Hey.. manipal petrol is over. Fill it up and come.

395
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,660
You've ridden it as much as you want,now giving me keys after the petrol is empty?

396
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:40,940
Tea... Give me! Boxing competitons are happening in the campus it seems. Anyone is willing to give their name..?

397
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,360
Hey dhasthagiri give my name too please. Last year I forgotted.

398
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:49,360
You are like a boxing bag brother. You can only get hit, you can't hit back..

399
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,040
Why brother? Someone like you asked for a cradle even though there's no place to sleep

400
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,220
Eat,read and sleep it's enough.

401
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,980
Hey, he fights very well. Let's give his name..

402
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,500
Ignore his word.

403
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,220
Give me the bread slice.

404
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:03,840
Brother, why do you live with no self respect at all?

405
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,360
Give that!

406
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,920
The other day I was trying to understand the theory. I didn't understand anything.

407
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,100
If you've any doubts in that chapter... Let me know. I will tel you.

408
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:23,020
What? I'll ask if i see you. you said you will ask. why are looking like that now..

409
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:27,620
Look!

410
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,620
why are you going that side..?

411
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,760
I'll go straight and ask

412
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,540
Let me know if you have any doubts in physics.

413
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,660
Hi.

414
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,880
Hi, tell me.

415
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,080
Haa.. haa..what... Maaya you're here? wanna have tea?

416
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,780
I didn't come here for your hospitality.

417
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,520
Why did you involve me in all this?

418
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,880
You're Maaya? nice to meet you.

419
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:24,800
I threw the plate without knowing. why did you blow that up...?

420
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:29,200
I can see confidence in your eyes.. Read some Che Guevara and bhagat singh books. You'll know new stuff.

421
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,220
Poor girl. She's shivering because of one fight. you're making her sweat by talking about revolution?

422
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,220
Good word. Books it seems, read.

423
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,520
What.. did you ask him? Did you ask him firmly?

424
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,020
let's go to Koti and buy some books.

425
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:14,160
Koushik, even for a small mistake, that satya's men are making a fool out of us.

426
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,580
Tell me, why do you mind that new guy, brother?

427
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,700
You're forgetting your status and making hero out of that George.

428
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,080
The Strongest won't win a war, but one who firmly waits for a chance.

429
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,600
But...

430
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,300
The ball is in his court. let the ball bounce and come to our court.

431
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,040
Hey..Stop it. Why are you playing like a girls.

432
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,360
Play with this.

433
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,960
Kishan Singh's Gang are forcing to vacate the place.

434
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,520
Brother!

435
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:59,360
You're writing against Kishan singh? How dare you..?

436
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,500
Idiots, what is the problem with you brothers this morning

437
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,220
Dude, what is my situation if it hits me in the wrong place.

438
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,800
You're cheating brother.

439
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,980
Dude, I will break your teeth.

440
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,660
Dude,read quickly and give me the book.

441
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,020

This hostel.

445
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,800
What are you studying this early in the morning? what does your father do?

446
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,180

-He does cutting brother!

447
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,520

448
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,920
See he has a lot of hair, go cut his hair!

449
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:44,980
Go.

450
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,840
Brother, Brother, that's my book. 
-dude wait!

451
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,120

-president brother.

452
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,720

453
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,900

-brother, my father...

456
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,300
Yeah. he makes shoes right? 
-Yes

457
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,220
Go make a shoe and come 
Go.

458
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,480
Hey Come here.

459
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,780
Where is your hostel? 
what does your father do?

460
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,640
what does your father do?

461
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,280
why is he looking at him?

462
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,500
You wait.

463
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,180
Do you have a father?

464
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,820
hey, you beat up a senior!

465
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:43,500
What do you think about yourself?

466
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,060
Day by day you are behaving like this campus is your own property.

467
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,500
you are all students here, but you are all behaving like rowdies.

468
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,800
I hate this kind of behavior.

469
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,320
You guys are repeating the same mistake for the bloody third time.

470
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,120
I’ve given you enough chances, I can’t take this anymore.

471
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,800
I want to teach you a lesson.

472
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:09,760
I am suspending you for one year, go get lost.

473
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,320
I should not see you in the classes or in the campus for next one year.

474
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:15,900
Understand.

475
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,420
Sir, student's career is at risk. Forgive him for once.

476
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:22,920
Sorry sir.

477
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:24,100
Thank you sir.

478
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,400
Dude, traditions in campus and society are for us.

479
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,280
I have helped you, even though you are not from our party.

480
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:34,960
If you do these stupids stuff again, I'll rip your teeth off your face. Get out.

481
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,280
Greetings Laxman Brother.

482
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:38,380
Greetings Koushik. What are you doing here?

483
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,160
been in a fight early in the morning, it seems

484
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,980
Yeah... What else do we have to do?

485
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,820
Weather is too hot. Put some water on, it will fume.

486
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,600
Brother, Laxman...! 
-aaa

487
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:49,380
give me hand shake

488
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,880
No.. No.. go.

489
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,880
Watch and learn 
-greetings laxman brother...

490
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,320
Looking at the manners,I think someone's gonna die..!

491
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,400
you have to take some action seriously

492
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,960
I wil do something about it. 
-Greetings sir!

493
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,180
Koushik, this early? Any complaint?

494
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,060
we already gave a complaint sir.

495
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,060
There's no one in the campus who doesn't like sai. They beat his men up.

496
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:19,720
A fight in the canteen the other day. Then today they broke sai friend's face.

497
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,020
If you don't take a serious action. I'll take this to the higher authorities sir

498
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,160
I know every thing. I will look into it..! go.

499
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,440
sure, thank you.

500
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,680
thank you sir.

501
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,300
Hey, we caught George at the right time. He wouldn't fight anyone else from now.

502
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,300
there's no need to think about it too much

503
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,760
Tell our guys to be strong.

504
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,140
Whatever happens, I'm here.

505
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,040
Brother, this is George reddy's gang.

506
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,360
They are kids.

507
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,180
But let’s keep police out of this.

508
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,180
I have to figure out something do.

509
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:55,680
good morning sir.

510
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:56,760
good morning sir.

511
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,940
George Reddy.

512
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,200
what's happening?

513
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:04,260
You look decent but are into rowdism.

514
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,920
Sir, I am the one who beat them up, but atleast ask me why I did it.

515
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,580
That is not my concern.

516
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,240
Bringing weapon into the campus is similar to attempt to murder.

517
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,960
Type a rustication letter for an year.

518
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,320
ok sir.

519
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,040
Sir, no body is questioning in the campus sir.

520
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,460
sir, who did wrong here..? who are you rusticating sir?.

521
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,960
Those are the guys who created ruckus, those are the guys who shut the classes off, those guys do ragging

522
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,960
and you're rusticating george sir?

523
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,740
Is this justice sir?.

524
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:31,380
I'll have a talk..!

525
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,520
What will you speak sir, Lalan came into middle of the campus and played football, no one spoke anything

526
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,340
Isn’t it wrong to use weapon in the campus?

527
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,460
Everytime you're bringing up weapon. Do you know how many weapons there are in lalan's hostel..?

528
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,080
Now you're talking. what happened then..? why didn't you speak up then? tell me why didn't you.

529
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,880
That day before VC...

530
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:46,400
Hey don't shout...

531
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,200
Sir, strongest will be the powerful in the campus sir.

532
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:54,260
Okay! sir, we want to show our strength, we want to do our own bandh

533
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,120
If we get hot tempered, we will do the riot before VC's room.

534
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,620
Rajanna,

535
00:44:56,980 --> 00:44:57,960
leave this matter here.

536
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,940
I have to go to library to read. don't spoil your future for me.

537
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,000
Sorry sir.

538
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,340
What is this lallan…

539
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,500
What is happening..?

540
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,080
What's todays special in Dhoolpet game?

541
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,960
Do you not have any shame?

542
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,740
Get out of here.

543
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,760
Enough of studying. Have something to eat.

544
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:20,040
Brother, Kaushik and his gang are protesting asking for seats & scholarship for our people.

545
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:28,080
Sathya! 
Down down.

546
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,720
Okay, I'll go there day after tomorrow.

547
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,640
Ramnayak, get up! Did you come here to sleep?

548
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,880
We can't let him get away!

549
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,000
Okay okay! Hey, get me one beedi and two teas.

550
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,220
Hey! Stand up.

551
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:03,720
Stand up!

552
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,540
Why should I?

553
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:06,100
I'm from Lalan's gang.

554
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,000
Who is that?

555
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,980
Wait right here, I'll show you.

556
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,760
Useless guy with useless news. Nobody understands him.

557
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,900
Brother, can you fill this form out for me?

558
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,360
Pass me the pen

559
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,780
They've opened a bangle shop next to the canteen, shall we go shop there?

560
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,380
maaya..

561
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,720
Can you pass me that pen!

562
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,100
Where are these people?

563
00:47:40,940 --> 00:47:48,560
Tell me five things that George was fighting for, just like crisp & five things you can tell me.

564
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,540
Only 5? I can name 500.

565
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:53,060
He stopped ragging against students.

566
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,780
He fought for everyone to get the same food in the canteen.

567
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:59,440
He's made sure that everyone who deserves a scholarship, got one.

568
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,060
There are many more things that George Reddy has done for the students, madam.

569
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,000
One of these days, George will face these people as well.

570
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,220
Come here. Come here, fool.

571
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:17,340
Greetings, madam.

572
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:20,340
Get him, get him now.

573
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,800
Hit him.. Hit him!

574
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,300
Do you not know who I am? Lalan!

575
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,060
Greetings, Koushik. 
-Greetings

576
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:36,960
Arjun, Take it.

577
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,480
Thank you

578
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:49,120
What kind of people are they!?

579
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:49,740
George..

580
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:51,920
Brother, did you see how that Arjun and Koushik are talking to each other?

581
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,420
Their people are fighting each other in public.

582
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:57,080
This!

583
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,720
Rajanna, you had to talk to me about something?

584
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:03,740
What else is there? That Lalan and outsiders are always doing this.

585
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,300
What are they saying?

586
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:06,940
What is this? Do you know how many people are there?

587
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:12,160
We can't tell the students and outsiders apart. That's how many they are. They're even harassing the girls.

588
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,640
As long as the outsiders are present in campus, this won't be resolved.

589
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,120
Who are all of you?

590
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,360
Hey, where did you come from?

591
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,000
Dhoolpet

592
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,240
Why aren't you saying anything?

593
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,180
What work do you have in campus?

594
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:40,420
Why are you harassing the girls? If I see any of you here again, I'll finish you right here.!

595
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:46,400
He's getting ahead of himself. I'll show him.

596
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,240
Where did you guys come from? Who allowed you in here?

597
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,360
Hey, show your man hood and come here. You were talking something until now, where are you going? Come here.

598
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:58,500
From tomorrow, if anyone wants to meet or talk to the girls, they should think twice.

599
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,760
Jyothi, don't go anywhere, stay right next to me.

600
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,080
Are you listening? If anyone is out of line, I'll beat each and every one of you.

601
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,160
Idiot, you complained to the VC about me? About me?

602
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:20,520
From tomorrow and I'll teach you what'll happen if you disobey me. I'll finish you all right here.

603
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:22,460
Get out of here!

604
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,520
George..

605
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:05,920
Hi

606
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,460
Dada, I've heard they're troubling the students here.

607
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:38,060
The rich are ruling the campus.

608
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,020
They're even entering the hostels and ragging people.

609
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,260
And we need to shut this down as there is no other go.

610
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,200
I think you step up and do something about it bro.

611
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,520
Hey, what are you doing here?

612
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,160
Why do you care?

613
00:51:57,860 --> 00:51:59,280
Fool, what happened?

614
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:05,040
If I see you ragging people here again, I'll strip you down and beat you.

615
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,040
You can eat something Village and stay there.

616
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:08,700
take this.

617
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,340
Did you come here to kill me?

618
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:12,780
Stay right here, I'll go study and come back.

619
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:44,200
Let's meet in the library then.

620
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,060
Okay, I'll leave now. See you later.

621
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,000
Okay, brother.

622
00:52:58,180 --> 00:52:58,720
hey chotu...

623
00:52:58,760 --> 00:52:59,260
Yes, brother.

624
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,200
Are you Kishan Singh's brother?

625
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,980
If there's ever a fight again. You can tell Balu about it.

626
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:06,800
Understand.

627
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:07,480
Okay!

628
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:08,380
I'll see you later!

629
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,600
Don't know what to do outside hence doing all these PH.D's.

630
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,180
Do you know another thing?

631
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,240
If I die, cremate me right here and I'll rest in peace!

632
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:21,940
Don't say that, brother.

633
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,160
The Government doesn't give us scholarships for us rest here.

634
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:26,700
We should go out and grow in life.

635
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,360
He is Raghu, my friend. And he is the new professor from today.

636
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,180
George Reddy has become a hero in campus. Outsiders are scared to even enter because of him.

637
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:45,340
It's not only that, Koushik. He's not thinking twice also before beating the upper caste people.

638
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,980
This isn't the campus I expected at all. It's very dangerous here.

639
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,620
Is there anyone fighting this with you?

640
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:32,520
What's your name? Which college are you from? I asked you. Tell me.

641
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,960
Who allowed you in here? Get out of here right now.

642
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:51,880
Stand up..

643
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:54,460
Stand up.

644
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,100
What is this?

645
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,120
Did you try cheating and get caught?

646
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,560
Stop it, brother!

647
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:28,980
What about our respect?

648
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:31,000
What's happened has happened. Let it go.

649
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:33,560
Do you think this is funny?

650
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:40,920
He told me this in front of everyone in the class. Let me see him outside and I'll finish him.

651
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:42,760
I'll show him who my brother is.

652
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,020
Explain it to them! They're troubling me since then!

653
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,020
Brother, let it go.

654
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,940
Look i am telling you, i'll leave the vehicle and walk away

655
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,300
Okay okay, let's go.

656
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,900
Look. Even I can't hold my laughter.

657
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,840
Brother, why is he making fun of him?

658
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:08,320
The exam results will be posted on the bulletin board of your respective college premises today at 3pm.

659
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,840
Move out my way... Give me space.

660
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,320
Who wrote their names on both sides to disrespect?

661
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,780
Hey I am telling you to move aside.

662
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:19,680
They didn't announce my name.

663
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:21,160
I think your parents does not put the name.

664
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:24,820
If you wrote the exam your name will come. Why would it come otherwise?

665
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:27,840
Each and everyone of us is losing respect. Shameful.

666
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:32,500
You've disrespected me in front of the whole class. Let me show you.

667
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:38,020
Fool, do you know who I am? Lalan

668
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,300
Get him. Get him

669
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,240
Idiot, I'll kill you.

670
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:47,220
Go

671
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,160
Hit it.

672
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,760
I've been in tension all morning. I'm scared. I've not even been able to pee since then.

673
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,260
Let it go.

674
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:04,900
hey you shld be aiming for the queen.

675
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,420
What did she say to you?

676
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,560
I'm losing respect. I'm being disrespected by this kid. It's shameful.

677
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:13,660
He's come. He'll disrespect me again now. What happened?

678
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,080
What happened, brother? Nothing happened!

679
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,340
That's Rajanna.

680
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:17,580
Stop worrying and tell me what has happened.

681
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,240
Now I should tell you and lose more respect? You passed the exam and I failed.

682
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:27,480
My family is working hard everyday to make sure I study and I'm disrespecting them by not studying.

683
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,120
They're sacrificing even basic meals to get me new clothes and make sure I study.

684
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,560
I've disrespected them completely.

685
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,240
exams are like passing clouds.

686
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:38,700
To succeed in life you need three things.

687
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,900
A wishbone, a funnybone, and a backbone. u have all three of them

688
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,600
What are you looking at? Play.

689
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:49,560
You've helped me pass my exams. How much work is this for you?

690
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:52,200
Hey... your win is confirmed. Just play

691
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:55,320
Brother, they've beaten Ramana Master.

692
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:55,920
Who are they?

693
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:57,320
Lalan and the outsidesr.

694
00:57:57,700 --> 00:58:00,020
Even yesterday, those outsiders made a scene outside the canteen.

695
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,460
It's hardly been 5 minutes since you passed. You're not even celebrating and already back to fights?

696
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,800
What celebration are you talking about?

697
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,000
Who the hell is this Lalan? What does he want?

698
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,600
As soon as it's 5 PM they're forming a group and sitting on campus. Who does he think he is?

699
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,020
Manipal, let's go break his legs. Let's go.

700
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:13,960
Hold on! Why do you want to fight?

701
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:14,740
Don't stop me.

702
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:17,340
As long as we're friends, it's my job to stop you!

703
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,060
Who are you?

704
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,780
Who the hell are you? What work do you have here?

705
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:53,760
Fool, I'm asking you. Tell me who you are. Answer me immediately!

706
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:55,880
Hey

707
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,960
Catch him from the back

708
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:29,500
Catch him

709
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,100
His shirt catches fire.

710
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,840
Hey, beat him, catch him that *****

711
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,160
Guys, come here.

712
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:06,800
Leave, leave lalan... leave him.

713
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,780
Hey fool, This is your college. If you want to study here, study properly

714
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:18,040
If i see the out siders in the campus again.. I'll break your legs.

715
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:37,260
Hey Satanna, there is nothing to worry.

716
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:40,200
I've already spoken to minister.

717
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:46,380
Sir showed us a nice place to stay outside the city. Why don't you go stay there!

718
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,840
Where should we go? Where?

719
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:54,560
You don't have any sadness or sorrow. Are you even a human being?

720
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,960
Our huts have burned down and we're in sorrow.

721
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,100
Do it fast..!

722
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,240
Please hold on,

723
01:02:02,260 --> 01:02:03,300
He's asking us to leave!

724
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,700
Do you think I'm joking?

725
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:07,280
Their lives have burned down.

726
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:10,940
Look

727
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:16,040
Nobody was inside the huts when it burned down, luckily.

728
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,340
What if there were infants inside? Then what?

729
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,780
You should have understood by now. How many times do I tell you?

730
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,840
I'm saying this for your own good.

731
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,180
S.I Sir,

732
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,720

734
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,500

01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,820
lalan bro was beaten very badly and bruised.

743

01:02:59,260 --> 01:02:59,760

01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,220

Hello..

758
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:35,080
Idiot, didn't I tell you that you're not allowed on campus if you bring cameras?

759
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,900
Okay, wait. We're coming.

760
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,060
Hi Mr. Sathyadev…!

761
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:44,700
Greetings Sir!

762
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:49,300
Remember we spoke yesterday. So, I hope you remember George Reddy?

763
01:03:51,220 --> 01:03:57,040
George… its been a while since I heard his name.

764
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:02,220
Yaa so, what I really wanna say is, why were you people against him

765
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:10,900
I never met him personly. I know him through fight he was involved in. that’s all I know.

766
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:17,580
What are you saying, are you indicating that he is a rowdy. I am Sorry. but George is a gold medalist.

767
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:25,100
Also, I heard he was offered scholarship in Mumbai University?

768
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,600
Seriously? God!

769
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:41,700
Madam, did he say anything?

770
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,320
Hey George, lets go for a drive…!

771
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,600
George, why do you want to get into this just before leaving.

772
01:04:58,940 --> 01:04:59,640
Hey, you wait.

773
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:00,140
Brother, even I'll come.

774
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:01,280
Rajanna, It's fine

775
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:09,600
Hi George...

776
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:10,100
Hi..

777
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:16,280

778
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:17,220
thank you

779
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:18,940
Do you plan on leaving?

780
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:22,560
You belong here george.

781
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,300
These students need a leader to move in the right direction. And that is you.

782
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:36,900
Think about it. If we work hard, we can give these students a bright future.

783
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:38,460
Just think again.

784
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,860
George, think about it. You and I can give these students the guidance they deserve.

785
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:53,680
Bye.

786
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:54,940
Thank you.

787
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:55,860
What did he say?

788
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:56,360
No idea, brother.

789
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:05,200
Let's go.

790
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,220
What happened, brother? What did he say?

791
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,980
Why are all of you silent?

792
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:14,140
I'll never forget the time we spent with you, George!

793
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:15,420
Have tea, brother.

794
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,660
all the best george..! Study well

795
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:23,600
He'll anyway study well. You all need to study well now, like me.

796
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:26,040
You're one to talk. You're studying so hard.

797
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:30,400
I have a small request from you people before I leave this campus.

798
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:32,160
What?

799
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,860
A lot of people are looking for courage in the books

800
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:38,220
You should talk to such people for atleast 10 minutes.

801
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:47,660
Why are you packing your clothes? Where are you going?

802
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,420
You've read all the books George gave you and turned into a library.

803
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:59,580
I'm talking to you only! What happened?!

804
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:08,800
George likes me. He still has the pen he borrowed from me.

805
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:12,880
He's keeping my handkerchief and reading every book I gave him.

806
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:16,780
What proof you want, that he likes me?

807
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:21,260
Why the hell are you asking me this? You can directly ask him!

808
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,100
Come to Arts College tomorrow. George is holding a meeting!

809
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:26,680
Hey Lalitha Come to Arts College tomorrow. George is holding a meeting!

810
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:27,440
I'll be there.

811
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:37,400
Koushik, that fellow is holding a meeting everyday at different places.

812
01:07:38,740 --> 01:07:42,560
There's a meeting near the Arts College. We shouldn't let it happen, Koushik.

813
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:47,600
We have to do everything, we can to stop that meeting from happening.

814
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:48,320
hello brother...!

815
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:50,060
Hi Sai, have a seat!

816
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,120
Take 50 of our men tomorrow to George's meeting.

817
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:57,680
To fight him?

818
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:00,000
To Support him.

819
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,960
What are you saying, Koushik? Why would we support him?

820
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:08,140
Jayanth, we're losing the election!

821
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,100
You're a mastermind at planning this, brother.

822
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:17,940
Sathya!

823
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:30,000
Who the hell is he, brother?

824
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:37,020
He came here recently. He is changing his colors everyday. What is his plan after all?

825
01:08:37,260 --> 01:08:39,320
He wants a meeting near the Arts College, apparently!

826
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:43,720
Can anyone host a meeting without the president's permission?

827
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:49,640
It's not only him. Other's will gain courage from looking at him and do this tomorrow.

828
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:54,720
There's no meeting, nothing. Get out of here.

829
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:55,220
I'm talking to you guys, get out of here.

830
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,420
What is this opposition for everything we say, brother?

831
01:08:56,660 --> 01:08:57,580
Let's go now. It's time for the meeting.

832
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:58,100
Ramu, get out of here.

833
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:58,640
Rajanna is here, look guys.

834
01:08:58,640 --> 01:08:59,540
I was talking about you guys only!

835
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:01,080
Atleast you guys go for the meeting!

836
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:02,420
We don't want to attend any meetings, get lost.

837
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:03,760
The meeting is for you guys.

838
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:07,460
What happened to you people? Did someone threaten you? Did someone hurt you? Tell me, I'll break his bones.

839
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:07,960
I can't help but laugh at Rajanna.

840
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:08,940
He's coming... 
Ramu, go, get out of here. Go Ramu.

841
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:12,280
Do none of you have any shame? He's working so hard to help all of you only.

842
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:15,040
Go sit in the hostel quietly now, you cowards.

843
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:52,260
No one will come dada..!

844
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:58,860
Didn't I tell you they won't come? They won't. Bloody turncoats all of them.

845
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:01,540
Didn't I tell you they won't come? They won't. They are like sheeps

846
01:10:02,180 --> 01:10:03,260
These people need a beating. They won't come to their senses otherwise.

847
01:10:03,340 --> 01:10:05,780
Idiots... They get scared of every tom and dick. ... Eunuchs!

848
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,980
does it seem like we are inviting them for a marriage? 
Manipal, lets go and smash their heads.

849
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:09,580
Let's go!

850
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,640
What nonsense are you doing here..It's a problem If i come or don't come.

851
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:14,060
Don't talk shit.. I will slap you otherwise

852
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:15,560
Will you murder me and become rowdy rajanna

853
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,180
I"ll kill you if he is going to come between us.

854
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:16,680
Raajanna..

855
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,020
Brother... Brother... Brother...

856
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:31,760
Brother, We made a game plan and took 50 members but they were 5000 members.

857
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,400
5000 members?

858
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,060
What.. 5000 members for George meeting?

859
01:10:38,060 --> 01:10:38,560
Yeah Brother!

860
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:41,740
Who the hell is this .....?

861
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:53,820
Thanks for trusting me and coming here.

862
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,680
Will tell you one thing. Please remember it.

863
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:02,600
nothing can be created.. nothing can destroy anything...!

864
01:11:05,080 --> 01:11:06,900
This sense of fear has not born today.

865
01:11:07,820 --> 01:11:11,220
Nothing can kill the courage of retaliation from your heart.

866
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:14,320
The day after today…

867
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:20,080
A new way of thinking and a new identity..! Let's forget the issues and take a step forward..

868
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,480
Will this campus problems get resolved..?

869
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,760
Brother, I am going mad by seeing this crowd.

870
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:33,680
Operation and humilation is to death then assault is to fearlessness

871
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:44,580
even if the Injustice were being done, not letting us move, not letting us breath by putting a chunk of burning coal on the chest.

872
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,280
Its time to break this undemocratic silence.

873
01:11:51,360 --> 01:11:57,580
If anyone tries to assault anybody in the name of religion and caste, I'll Slap them.

874
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:02,700
Chase them and hit if they fail to provide you good food.

875
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:10,280
If anyone tries to stop your research or scholarships or anything for that matter, Ask them firmly.

876
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,760
No one is teaching no one here in the name of mercy.

877
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:18,800
This university is running only with the taxes that are being paid by our parents with their hard earned money.

878
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:25,360
So, eradicate the thought of rich & the poor from your mind.

879
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:30,640
Study for your self confidence. Fight for your self respect

880
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,780
Death lies nowhere but in our self confidence

881
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,060
We are with you George! one person like you is enough for us.

882
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,440
Gully people. How many we have seen..

883
01:12:50,940 --> 01:12:52,180
Have you ever thought you would see me like this?

884
01:12:55,580 --> 01:13:02,660
I have started something similar five years back. Something new is going to start.

885
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,840
raise your voice...!

886
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:10,460
raise your voice...!

887
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,160
raise your voice...!

888
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:17,540
raise your voice...!

889
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,360
raise your voice...!

890
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,780
raise your voice...!

891
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:25,940
raise your voice...!

892
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:27,540
Before the truth dies…!

893
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,480
did you see granny? how your campus is changed?

894
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:12,580
ok bye.

895
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:15,220
say bye to granny..! bye .bye..!

896
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:28,700
you know I have something for you

897
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:33,500
This is the best pictures I got of yours and granny.

898
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:37,500
Same

899
01:14:39,260 --> 01:14:40,680
you look just like her

900
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:45,360
Do you have any recent pictures..?

901
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:47,720
Oh yeah, I have some pictures actually

902
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,060
see…

903
01:14:51,980 --> 01:14:53,280
I will send this to you.

904
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,680
Ma’am, I have a question

905
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:04,480
I heard that in your college days you guys were scared to go out. Is it true?

906
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:08,280
Most of the time. Wait I have something for you too.

907
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:24,280
this?

908
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:27,260
George did this with his own hands.

909
01:15:28,340 --> 01:15:31,720
Yes, my father used to tell me.

910
01:15:32,940 --> 01:15:36,240
But, I never thought I will see Madam.

911
01:15:53,260 --> 01:15:55,520
I am leaving university because of higher studies…

912
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:59,640
What is this bro, every day one guy comes & gives us sermon.

913
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:00,540
Did you see?

914
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:01,460
Why do we care if someone talks...?

915
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:02,060
No

916
01:16:02,320 --> 01:16:03,520
We have enough of ours...!

917
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:09,600
Our campus should shine with culture, heritage, and ethics like it does every time.

918
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:15,960
stop…! people were praising us for our yesterday meeting. see now!.

919
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:22,980
from today onwards Arjun will look after you and party too.

920
01:16:25,700 --> 01:16:28,720
Hail India…!

921
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,500
look… hey, look. oh, respected elder look.

922
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:31,380
how did he even born.

923
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:34,980
Till now those guys listened to Satya bro like sheeps. from now they will listen to Arjun.

924
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:41,960
When will they change… animals!

925
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,240
they will raise Voice when they want to change.

926
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,140
Go… go and ask.

927
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,260
Rey, go…go ask

928
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,880
to raise their voice you go and ask to raise their voice

929
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:56,600
I will ask them for sure I will ask them but not me. Sridevi

930
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:08,020
Sir came

931
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:14,160
Greetings!.

932
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,780
why did you come here?

933
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:18,020
We want only the land which belongs to us but not any other land,

934
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,540
what’s the use sir by the land which doesn’t belong to us?

935
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,240
See, you guys used to stay in a hut.

936
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:28,160
Government sanctioned you a house instead of land,why are you bothered. let us go

937
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:29,760
sir...

938
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:32,020
Hey, they don’t care about us no matter how many days pass.

939
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:34,180
Koushik...

940
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:39,520
Sir, this time sathya is not in competition instead that brainless Arjun is competing.

941
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:44,840
Sit,Sit …. you also sit…! please sit

942
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:47,780
Nobody wins with this attitude.

943
01:17:48,820 --> 01:17:52,140
you know what’s your problem is?… you are not using your attitude in a right way.

944
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:56,020
you should convert his attitude as your sympathy in people.

945
01:17:57,300 --> 01:17:58,300
Understood.

946
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:03,080
Ok sir, next time i will do as you said.

947
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,020
ok, good.

948
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:05,040
I will take a leave sir.

949
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:19,360
Dear students, there are three parties in the race for this year's election announcement.

950
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:24,340
VC gave permission to start their campaigning from tomorrow.

951
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:34,160
Koushik zindabad.

952
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:42,200
Arjun zindabad.

953
01:18:43,820 --> 01:18:45,680
Everybody started their campaigning… look we are doing march past.

954
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:49,180
Hi Maaya, do you have any work, or did you just come to class like that?

955
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:53,060
what are you searching? Do you want anything…?

956
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:55,200
We need a flag for our party.

957
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:56,080
Flag?

958
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,180
Does your party have any Agenda?

959
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:01,940
We would like to fight back injustice happening in our campus. Our flag should reflect that emotion.

960
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,360
Then red color flag is correct for you…!

961
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:04,180
Hey

962
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,420
Nagaraju.

963
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:10,160
yes brother.

964
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:10,960
Come here.

965
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:22,420
Maaya, give me your hair band once.

966
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:30,340
give me your hand.

967
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:38,360
fold your wrist.

968
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:51,820
Hey, stick this to that wall.

969
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:52,840
Hey, stick it properly.

970
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:22,900
Hey, stick here.

971
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,900
What the hell are you looking at?

972
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:29,880
lets stick those.

973
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,620
We might be product of our past. But not prisoners of it.

974
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:50,640
From past three years you served like slaves and you take us for granted you will see CheGuevera .

975
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:58,440
My aim is to make Arjun step down from that position, and i need your help for that.

976
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,980
Jai hind... Jai hind.

977
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,300
No matter how much sound a grass hoper makes it won’t ever become a lion.

978
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:25,120
From last three years, students are expecting our win and their loss.

979
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:33,900
In between small parties are getting prepared for the race. we should kill them in the first stage itself..!

980
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:37,240
Vande Mataram...

981
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:55,420
Do you know which Is that one flag flying in the country and the college ?

982
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,000
The flag of dominance.

983
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:03,100
Its not the flag but the agenda is important.

984
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,760
Are they even talking about that ? No.

985
01:22:06,620 --> 01:22:09,240
because they only seek dominance.

986
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:15,640
If not him it let it be someone else and viceversa.

987
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:19,000
Thats how they want to rule one after the other.

988
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,400
To put an end to these attrocities is our ajenda.

989
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,460
Bro, pan.

990
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,320
You keep listening to the songs.

991
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:35,440
come.

992
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,760
Hey, donkey

993
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,360
tell her, she keeps hiting all the time.

994
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,080
Not going to college but sitting at home like a women.

995
01:22:46,660 --> 01:22:49,200
These days students are clapping even for the newbie beggers.

996
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:49,720
Hey

997
01:22:49,980 --> 01:22:51,740
Party gets the energy only when there are chunk of people behind it.

998
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,380
Claps for a couple of words.

999
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:55,180
This is not we want.

1000
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:56,800
We want.

1001
01:22:58,500 --> 01:22:59,100
Sympathy.

1002
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:03,100
Sympathy? How?

1003
01:23:04,460 --> 01:23:06,240
That abcd gang, not just us

1004
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:09,140
But they've beaten whoever supported us. They'll hit you too.

1005
01:23:10,540 --> 01:23:13,920
They'll hit you for no reasons.

1006
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:16,060
So, you call this politics?

1007
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:21,100
Arjunaa

1008
01:23:25,260 --> 01:23:26,180
Tell laxmana

1009
01:23:26,180 --> 01:23:26,760
Arjunaa.

1010
01:23:27,220 --> 01:23:28,880
Did you notice these chaos?

1011
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,720
That guy inspired women to question back

1012
01:23:35,700 --> 01:23:39,940
This chubby man earns sympathy by hitting his own gang with his team.

1013
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:45,040
Hey Arjunaa this university is being turned into a battalfiled.

1014
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:47,580
koushik zindabad.

1015
01:23:47,820 --> 01:23:55,660
koushik zindabad

1016
01:23:55,760 --> 01:24:00,100
PS Zindabad

1017
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,740
You dont worry bro. this time we will win for sure.

1018
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:03,560
Hey stick it fast.

1019
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:10,660
Hey Ramakrishna what are you doing...?

1020
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:12,580
Hey Sai what work do you have here.get lost.

1021
01:24:12,980 --> 01:24:13,900
Why this over action.

1022
01:24:14,700 --> 01:24:15,940
Hey stop it.

1023
01:24:16,060 --> 01:24:16,960
Hey stop it.

1024
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:25,360
Hey, Stick it fast.

1025
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,440
This time the competition is between three guys sir.

1026
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,640
The elections here are going way beyond the political elections.

1027
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:35,160
they are provoking each other sir.Fights may happen at any time.

1028
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:37,920
Its better to have security in our campus.

1029
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,460
If anyone breaks the rule. I will suspend them.

1030
01:24:42,360 --> 01:24:45,040
They show the sky & the moon

1031
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,640
but give us peanuts in the end.

1032
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:50,080
Enough feeding them like pigs.

1033
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,640
We've done a mistake by giving them the power.

1034
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:55,440
Its high time to rectify our mistakes.

1035
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,520
We don't want any customs.

1036
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,960
Development. I'll achieve that.

1037
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,360
I'll be with you.

1038
01:25:03,940 --> 01:25:06,560
Inspite of the freedom we have made ourselves

1039
01:25:06,720 --> 01:25:07,440
and the party prisoners.

1040
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:10,620
Look at the other independent nations

1041
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,600
Look at their development.

1042
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,660
Why?

1043
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:17,360
Because They've believed in their own religion & tradition.

1044
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:19,140
if the same opportunity is given to you...

1045
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:21,980
You will misuse that too. Spit.

1046
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:24,760
You're misleading the people in the name of our country.

1047
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,320
Mind it. Be careful.

1048
01:25:26,760 --> 01:25:27,980
Do you have the courage?

1049
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:33,180
I repeat Arts college or Engineering college?

1050
01:25:33,320 --> 01:25:37,840
To all those agents who care for the neighbouring countries, Be careful.

1051
01:25:38,340 --> 01:25:40,180
does problems get solved by throwing questions.

1052
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:42,260
is this what we need right now?

1053
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,200
there is emotional politics.

1054
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:47,960
Are you trying to be the winner by creating hatred.

1055
01:25:48,200 --> 01:25:51,320
That is the reason why the strong suppresses the weak in college elections.

1056
01:25:51,540 --> 01:25:52,780
Hence these fights in university.

1057
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:56,080
Don’t fall in this bloody trap.

1058
01:25:57,420 --> 01:25:59,860
Remind all the students about the good work they do.

1059
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,120
Tell them, even though the flags are different but the agenda is the same.

1060
01:26:03,620 --> 01:26:09,280
Raise your voice...!

1061
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,000
what have you done brothe?. How many days...!

1062
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:16,060
You need our students votes only during elections?

1063
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,760
What have you done when we were on the roads for mess fee hike

1064
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:22,360
You say elections are for change after you win you change your agenda .

1065
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:24,640
After all these years what have you done with the power you had.?

1066
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:28,860
when we ask for scholarships aren't you the one who asked our caste & religion

1067
01:26:29,380 --> 01:26:32,680
what have you done when students are suffering from ragging ?

1068
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:36,240
Did anyone bother when we complained about maggots in the rice ?

1069
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,040
we are the one who cast our votes to make you win but you give scholarships to your group of people.

1070
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:39,540
what kind of justice is this ?

1071
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:41,340
Do you work only if you have power or what ?

1072
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:52,620
Hey Nitin.

1073
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:53,640
Koushik

1074
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:00,080
you stopped sticking posters just because they are asking questions ?

1075
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:03,640
that ABCD group people pasted their posters on ours .

1076
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:06,360
hmm.., not only that,they are planning to hit us also.

1077
01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:13,260
In an hour all the posters of Arjun should be plastered with cowdung .

1078
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:26,380
Arjunaa! its raining questions in the campus.

1079
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:32,000
all these response is because of that newbie Reddy fellow using the same slogan "Raise your Voice "

1080
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:34,560
Even before the response begins,

1081
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,600
we should be ready with one answer to all the questions that have been asked.

1082
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,700
I thought George is only man of words.

1083
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:42,800
Will wait for the right time.

1084
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,740
even a small mistake happens we will put him a check.

1085
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:49,920
Rajanna

1086
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:50,800

don't worry it's ok

1220
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:44,860
GOVT behaviour should change. they can't profit from us.

1221
01:46:45,240 --> 01:46:46,680
Stop .. stop .

1222
01:46:46,720 --> 01:46:49,080
there is no food for farmer who grows rice .

1223
01:46:49,520 --> 01:46:51,220
no clothers to cover.

1224
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:56,280
this is it... this is all we have take it take it take it .

1225
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:03,940
Lands are being tilled but we are getting no fruits..

1226
01:47:03,940 --> 01:47:05,920
There is no secuity for the elders,

1227
01:47:06,040 --> 01:47:10,080
What is it called when the direction of the orbit is the same as the direction of the earth's rotation?

1228
01:47:10,460 --> 01:47:11,640
It is called Posigrade.

1229
01:47:12,520 --> 01:47:17,680
What is the angle of inclination for the satellite following an equatorial orbit?

1230
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:19,360
Zero degrees inclination.

1231
01:47:20,280 --> 01:47:23,640
What is the maximum speed of the satellite in an elliptical area?

1232
01:47:24,140 --> 01:47:28,120
The speed changes depending upon the height of the satellite, high above the Earth.

1233
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:32,760
What is the time period taken by the satellite to go around the orbit called?

1234
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:34,660
It is called Sidereal period

1235
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:38,900
and the Sidereal orbit uses external forces such as the Sun and stars, for your reference.

1236
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:40,660
Ok George, we'll let you know.

1237
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:50,840
Congratulations George. The panel is very impressed. I wish you turn out be a great asset to our project.

1238

If they betray us? will our boys let them go!!

1243
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:04,080
this is not looking like a small fight.

1244
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:08,560
Take it. and explain it to him properly.

1245
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,060

1257
01:49:39,860 --> 01:49:40,820

How many days will you take? I didn’t write it well myself.

1265
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,220
brother has sent Stupid people

1266
01:49:57,020 --> 01:49:58,280
You shld have stabbed 3 more times…

1267
01:49:58,760 --> 01:49:59,840
Get out of my way, monkey!

1268
01:50:00,060 --> 01:50:01,160
It’s been 3 months that fellow died.

1269
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:01,660
Hey!

1270
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:04,040
What did you say?

1271
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,380
Who the hell are you?

1272
01:50:05,380 --> 01:50:06,360
Speak louder if you have it in you!

1273
01:50:06,420 --> 01:50:07,200
Who the hell are you?

1274
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,720
Say what you have to, to my face!

1275
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:09,760
What happened to you, *******.!

1276
01:50:09,880 --> 01:50:13,460
******* I’ll kill you and bury you right here in the campus.

1277
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:14,880
Come to me! I’m right here.

1278
01:50:15,060 --> 01:50:18,760
Stay right there! If I don’t break your head today, I’m going to change my name!.

1279
01:50:18,820 --> 01:50:19,740
Hit me! Come hit me if you have it in you!

1280
01:50:19,740 --> 01:50:20,900
Why do you want to fight with scum like him?

1281
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:24,560
I’ll kill you right where you are.

1282
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:41,220
***. I’m letting you live because you’re a student.

1283
01:50:42,340 --> 01:50:43,840
Try threatening me again..

1284
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:46,100
I’ll cut you right where you stand

1285
01:50:48,420 --> 01:50:48,920
Get out of my sight!

1286
01:50:50,200 --> 01:50:51,360
Slap him brother

1287
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:54,560
If we kill this one guy, the whole university will be better.

1288
01:50:57,200 --> 01:50:58,800
What do you want? Get out of my sight!

1289
01:51:04,640 --> 01:51:07,580
The police are refusing to accept any complaints against this guy!

1290
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:08,880
What do we do?

1291
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,440
First, we should complain to the VC.

1292
01:51:11,620 --> 01:51:12,880
That’s already been done, brother.

1293
01:51:13,240 --> 01:51:14,500
The VC isn’t who we should be complaining to..

1294
01:51:14,920 --> 01:51:18,180
Hey man, you just got here. Why do you want to start fights again?

1295
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:20,220
HEY! How many times should I tell you not to get involved in these matters.

1296
01:51:22,660 --> 01:51:24,660
Let it go. He’s not worth.

1297
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:28,620
Let me know who to meet. We shouldn't leave him.

1298
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:31,620
Who we need right now isn’t the VC.

1299
01:51:38,420 --> 01:51:42,300
Dear friends, I don’t intend on speaking to you about the injustice that I have been put through today.

1300
01:51:42,780 --> 01:51:44,180
It’s about the farmers killing themselves.

1301
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:47,780
Our leaders have time to eat but,

1302
01:51:48,360 --> 01:51:51,280
They don’t have the time to think about the farmers working hard to provide us with this food..

1303
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,520
We fought for a week regarding the insects in our food.

1304
01:51:55,220 --> 01:51:58,640
We shut down our campus and even rounded the police stations for a week.

1305
01:51:59,340 --> 01:52:03,340
But, did anyone think about the farmers who poisons themselves using pesticides?

1306
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:05,400
Did you even question it?

1307
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:07,420
You’re right, George!

1308
01:52:07,620 --> 01:52:08,720
Even my father is a farmer.

1309
01:52:09,380 --> 01:52:13,040
He recently drank pesticides and killed himself.

1310
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:16,760
I watched him struggle but couldn’t do anything to help him.

1311
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:22,780
Let’s question them. I am with you George, we are all with you.

1312
01:52:23,340 --> 01:52:24,680
Let’s do it together.

1313
01:52:24,840 --> 01:52:26,620
Farmer’s rule, must live on.

1314
01:52:26,980 --> 01:52:30,220
Justice for the farmers! Farmers Zindabad!.

1315
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:32,260
Arjun bhai...

1316
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:33,840
Arjun bhai...

1317
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:35,080
What happened?

1318
01:52:37,300 --> 01:52:39,140
Lalan, What are you doing at this time?

1319
01:52:43,300 --> 01:52:44,880
I’ve lost all respect because of that kid!

1320
01:52:47,160 --> 01:52:48,600
What face do I have to show at college?

1321
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:51,900
I’m ashamed to go anywhere in the college .

1322
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:53,340
Nonsense!

1323
01:52:57,740 --> 01:53:00,900
I was born and brought up here!

1324
01:53:02,640 --> 01:53:06,260
Kishan Singh’s younger brother. Lallan.. Lallan Singh is my name!

1325
01:53:10,600 --> 01:53:11,600
Terrible

1326
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:15,660
He’s ruined my reputation on my turf.

1327
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:20,000
He’s made a fool out of me.

1328
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:25,580
People used to wet their pants at my sight. Today they’re questioning me.

1329
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:32,860
I wake up get treated like a woman.

1330
01:53:34,860 --> 01:53:37,960
Lallan is a panzy, they say.

1331
01:53:54,680 --> 01:53:56,340
Is this college belongs to his family??

1332
01:53:57,080 --> 01:53:59,880
He’s helping anyone in need. Is he that big of a man?

1333
01:54:03,540 --> 01:54:07,060
It’s either him or me.

1334
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:14,980
You’re not understanding, Arjun bhai.

1335
01:54:16,760 --> 01:54:18,200
I would’ve died, but I’m alive today.

1336
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,800
I’m not showing my face anywhere.

1337
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:25,860
I’m unable to swallow even a morsel of food.

1338
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:38,520
This time I'm going to contest in engineering college elections

1339
01:54:39,640 --> 01:54:43,000
Understand my frustration, Arjun bhai.

1340
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:47,140
Did you see that, Arjun? His hunger. His urge.

1341
01:54:48,620 --> 01:54:52,300
If everyone gave everyone what they wanted, the war of Kurukshetra wouldn’t have happened

1342
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,220
and this nation wouldn’t have been born.

1343
01:54:55,580 --> 01:55:00,000
“His empire was so overpowered that he loved the pride”.

1344
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:05,960
Kurukshetra set the stage for the defeat of the Pandavas or the defeat of the Kauravas.

1345
01:55:06,540 --> 01:55:08,540
This is what the Pandavas asked for.

1346
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:13,080
Today, he’s only thinking about this college.

1347
01:55:16,020 --> 01:55:16,940
Let’s go.

1348
01:55:17,360 --> 01:55:29,460
Save the Farmers!

1349
01:55:29,780 --> 01:55:32,900
We’ll fight for them till our last breath!

1350
01:55:33,360 --> 01:55:35,800
We’ll fight for them till our last breath!

1351
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:37,860
Farmer is the backbone of the nation they said.

1352
01:55:39,120 --> 01:55:40,340
But look at this condition today.

1353
01:55:40,980 --> 01:55:44,260
He is committing suicide on the same soil that he want's to use till

1354
01:55:44,760 --> 01:55:49,140
Let's maintain two minutes of silence for the same system which is no more.

1355
01:55:53,280 --> 01:55:55,920
They’ve put barbed wire to strangle the students.

1356
01:55:56,260 --> 01:55:59,320
As a political leader, let me know what I can do to help you.

1357
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,540
All these problems can only be solved by one person, sir.

1358
01:56:02,180 --> 01:56:03,320
I need to meet him once.

1359
01:56:09,980 --> 01:56:10,760
Greetings, sir

1360
01:56:11,060 --> 01:56:12,180
Greetings!

1361
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:15,660
Student leader George Reddy would like to speak to you for 2 minutes.

1362
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:18,880
I need to urgently leave to Delhi, no time for this.

1363
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:23,480
System down down…

1364
01:56:23,960 --> 01:56:31,280
The Government’s attitude must be destroyed.

1365
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,280
The nations future is in the hands of our students.

1366
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:34,980
One picture please.

1367
01:56:36,860 --> 01:56:38,380
There’s a lot of wrong happening on campus, sir.

1368
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:40,860
It’ll start off small but eventually be a big headache, sir.

1369
01:56:40,980 --> 01:56:43,620
The press is also making it a big deal, sir.

1370
01:56:44,120 --> 01:56:45,560
If they have the will to scream..

1371
01:56:46,460 --> 01:56:48,220
Law and order is in your hands.

1372
01:56:48,300 --> 01:57:14,400
Save the Farmers!

1373
01:57:16,900 --> 01:57:19,480
Save the Farmers!

1374
01:57:20,340 --> 01:57:22,760
Save the Farmers!

1375
01:57:29,140 --> 01:57:35,860
The Government’s attitude must perish

1376
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:11,040
Justice to the farmers!

1377
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:14,980
To face this repression. power must be ours. Then we transform our life

1378
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:18,900
Rajanna, we must tell the students of all states what we are fighting for.

1379
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:11,820
Hyderabad - Regional News

1380
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:17,380
The Osmania University turmoil of the last two days has hit the peak today.

1381
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:22,120
Student union leader George Reddy protested against the system.

1382
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:28,160
Learn to die if you want to live! Fight for your every right. Is the motto he’s taking up

1383
01:59:31,560 --> 01:59:34,900
There’s no competition for this years election. It’s an easy win for George.

1384
01:59:34,900 --> 01:59:35,400
Really?

1385
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:36,600
George bro will win, this is a guarantee.

1386
01:59:39,200 --> 01:59:40,060
What’s your name?

1387
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:40,640
Bharat.

1388
01:59:41,200 --> 01:59:42,020
Which college do you attend?

1389
01:59:42,020 --> 01:59:42,840
engineering first year!

1390
01:59:43,340 --> 01:59:43,840
You?

1391
01:59:44,120 --> 01:59:45,200
engineering first year...!

1392
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:46,280
You idoit.

1393
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:50,480
Do I look crazy to you?

1394
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:55,180
You scum, bloody scum. Come here, you. Come here.

1395
01:59:57,320 --> 02:00:00,140
Engineering students should support me. What do you think of yourself by supporting him?

1396
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:09,740
If I happen to lose these elections,

1397
02:00:13,300 --> 02:00:14,280
Ask him what will happen next.

1398
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:17,700
Are you men?

1399
02:00:19,580 --> 02:00:22,220
Remember my name. Lallan.

1400
02:00:24,820 --> 02:00:27,700
Dear friends, I write to you during these testing times.......

1401
02:00:31,100 --> 02:00:33,100
who are the nourishers of the nation grasping at straws but there seems to be no solution..

1402
02:00:33,100 --> 02:00:34,020
To their problems I as a fellow students and a sympathizer of the charity, request you to join.

1403
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:37,860
Leave the matter to me, leave the whole arts college matter to me.

1404
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:42,040
Just concentrate on the engineering college issue and leave the rest to me.

1405
02:00:42,040 --> 02:00:42,940
What’s this nonsense?

1406
02:00:43,540 --> 02:00:45,160
I’m being serious, leave me alone.

1407
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:45,660
Hey!

1408
02:00:46,060 --> 02:00:47,080
Why? I shouldn’t talk?

1409
02:00:47,160 --> 02:00:48,580
Don’t you dare, speak!

1410
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:52,980
If you say anything else, I’ll forget our friendship and end you right here.

1411
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:54,540
What’s this guy saying?

1412
02:00:54,600 --> 02:00:56,980
What’s this madness? What’s happening here?

1413
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:02,040
Since he wake up, these guys haven’t studied and this guy.

1414
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:04,080
He doesn’t have any clothes to wear, he will never get a scholarship.

1415
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:07,840
Someone like me doesn’t have a brain is what people like him think. Isn’t it?

1416
02:01:08,320 --> 02:01:11,620
Don’t we know why he’s here at the campus? What has this campus ever done for him?

1417
02:01:12,460 --> 02:01:13,780
What has it given him?

1418
02:01:14,840 --> 02:01:18,260
He had 22 Stabbes on his back. You’re the reason for this to happen.

1419
02:01:20,580 --> 02:01:25,060
His silly mother just wants one thing for him. For her son to study well.

1420
02:01:25,460 --> 02:01:28,900
She helped him to overcome these struggles. Won’t you let him live peacefully?

1421
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:32,040
He’s always involved in fights for this college.

1422
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:41,820
Death falls upon us only once.

1423
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:54,640
Until when will you pressure us into keeping our mouths shut?

1424
02:02:54,660 --> 02:02:57,500
A small fire can burn down a forest in a day.

1425
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:59,980
Now is our time, the fire in us is burning.

1426
02:03:00,640 --> 02:03:06,180
According to Section 144 of Campus Law, any students roaming in groups

1427
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:10,980
Legal action will be taken against those responsible for any undesirable events or unrest.

1428
02:03:11,160 --> 02:03:13,220
“Learn to die if you want to live"

1429
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:15,280
"Fight every step of the way for your right”

1430
02:03:15,580 --> 02:03:17,700
“Learn to die if you want to live"

1431
02:03:17,800 --> 02:03:19,900
"Fight every step of the way for your right”

1432
02:03:20,100 --> 02:03:22,280
“Learn to die if you want to live""

1433
02:03:22,340 --> 02:03:24,340
"Fight every step of the way for your right”

1434
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:25,260
“Learn to die if you want to live"

1435
02:03:25,260 --> 02:03:26,680
Sir, should I take action against them?

1436
02:03:26,700 --> 02:03:28,480
"Fight every step of the way for your right”

1437
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,160
“Learn to die if you want to live""

1438
02:03:34,160 --> 02:03:36,160
"Fight every step of the way for your right”

1439
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:41,320
“Learn to die if you want to live""

1440
02:03:41,320 --> 02:03:43,300
"Fight every step of the way for your right”

1441
02:03:43,900 --> 02:03:46,140
“Learn to die if you want to live""

1442
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:22,680
Hey Lalan inspite of getting beaten all the boys roaming with George Reddy only.

1443
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:24,420
Lalan.

1444
02:04:26,320 --> 02:04:30,720
For the first time in my life, I’ve trusted you and you’ve let me down

1445
02:04:33,440 --> 02:04:34,960
Arjun, do you mean our Lallan?

1446
02:04:35,660 --> 02:04:39,840
What happened? Why’s he quiet? Tsk Tsk Tsk….

1447
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:42,420
Hey!

1448
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:49,500
I was born here, brought up here. I’m Kishan Singh’s brother! Lallan… Lallan Singh is my name!

1449
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:56,620
He came to my turf and ruined my name. Claiming Lallan is a kid, Lallan is a coward.

1450
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:10,740
Arjun, what must Lallan ask him? Give him one chance to prove himself!

1451
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:20,220
Why are you quiet when this simpleton is insulting you, Lallan? Have you lost your tongue?

1452
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:30,520
You’ve ruined our whole name, Lallan?

1453
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:35,940
Looking at Lallan like this is making me sad, Arjun!

1454
02:05:40,300 --> 02:05:45,820
I’ve said it then, I’ll say it now! Lallan… Lallan Singh is my name!

1455
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:47,900
I've become cheap to everyone.

1456
02:06:05,480 --> 02:06:06,140
What happened?

1457
02:06:10,980 --> 02:06:11,840
What happened?

1458
02:06:14,780 --> 02:06:15,300
Right here!

1459
02:06:16,780 --> 02:06:22,600
It’s right here. That George has insulted me right here.

1460
02:06:25,180 --> 02:06:29,780
I’m telling you right now, brother! He shouldn’t win this election!

1461
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:46,980
I’m going home.

1462
02:06:54,060 --> 02:06:57,620
Lallan is threatening students because he’s not getting anyone’s support in the elections.

1463
02:06:57,840 --> 02:06:58,920
He’s not even part of our problems.

1464
02:06:59,820 --> 02:07:02,200
In this situation, any obstacle is a big problem to us.

1465
02:07:03,280 --> 02:07:05,620
The Police have cut the power to the the campus

1466
02:07:06,180 --> 02:07:08,800
We should have Rajanna go to Delhi University and calm this debacle down!

1467
02:07:09,220 --> 02:07:10,840
George, be careful, okay?

1468
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:11,660
Okay Mom.

1469
02:07:12,820 --> 02:07:14,080
if anybody does anything arrest them.

1470
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:20,520
Who are you? leave me i will see your end.

1471
02:07:20,640 --> 02:07:23,060
Hey Murthy, is it Rajanna? where did you get him ...?

1472
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:24,960
On the way to the canteen.

1473
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:27,040
hey give me that… son of a .....

1474
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:28,660
hit him, hit him harder.

1475
02:07:28,780 --> 02:07:31,380
hey leave me i will see your end. who are you?.

1476
02:07:31,460 --> 02:07:33,820
ok sir, hit him, hit him harder.

1477
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:34,640
Leave me if you have guts.

1478
02:07:36,920 --> 02:07:39,700
he got lots of attitude take him to warangal jail.

1479
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:41,980
hold him tight he is a dangerous guy.

1480
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:45,740
what is the reason for calling me..?

1481
02:07:45,740 --> 02:07:47,600
I heard about your fight.

1482
02:07:48,040 --> 02:07:51,760
If you join us our fight will get much more better.

1483
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:56,080
Srikaakulam farmer protest is my inspiration.

1484
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:58,360
I am doing the same thing by staying with people.

1485
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:01,260
Tomorrow you might take my path or I might take your path.

1486
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:04,980
but my fight is in very good shape.

1487
02:08:05,360 --> 02:08:06,020
laal salaam.

1488
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:07,340
laal salaam.

1489
02:08:16,500 --> 02:08:18,920
You use guns to fire after George's death.

1490
02:08:19,400 --> 02:08:22,560
I heard 1200 people died fighting for your problems.

1491
02:08:24,820 --> 02:08:26,240
What did you gain out of it?

1492
02:08:32,260 --> 02:08:33,600
Is this George's gun.

1493
02:08:33,720 --> 02:08:34,220
Yes.

1494
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:39,700
Why does a student leader need a gun?

1495
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:44,160
if george used this gun the history would have been something else.

1496
02:08:47,580 --> 02:08:48,340
Can I keep it?

1497
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:51,360
Anyways I believe you don't need anymore, So...

1498
02:08:54,100 --> 02:08:54,600
Thankyou.

1499
02:08:57,260 --> 02:08:57,760
Muskan..

1500
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,440
What are you going to gain out of this documentry?

1501
02:09:01,700 --> 02:09:02,700
We can change history.

1502
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:05,100
Let's go...

1503
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:29,660
I will take leave mother.

1504
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:33,660
Food... I will eat in the canteen

1505
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:38,040
take care everyone. if anyone

1506
02:09:38,240 --> 02:09:39,740
I told them to switch off the current.

1507
02:09:41,900 --> 02:09:43,120
You stay there and watch and make sure no one's coming.

1508
02:09:43,120 --> 02:09:43,700
ok sir

1509
02:10:03,420 --> 02:10:04,620
what is he doing?

1510
02:10:14,820 --> 02:10:16,820
get hold of him constables

1511
02:10:32,280 --> 02:10:34,280
“Learn to die if you want to live"

1512
02:10:34,680 --> 02:10:37,360
"Fight every step of the way for your right!"

1513
02:10:38,960 --> 02:10:41,500
"Fight every step of the way for your right!"

1514
02:10:41,700 --> 02:10:44,180
sir, its very difficult to control this George.

1515
02:10:44,360 --> 02:10:46,640
if he announces meeting thousand's of people are coming.

1516
02:10:46,820 --> 02:10:52,020
he will get support from every university to make the riots happen.

1517
02:10:53,420 --> 02:10:56,480
If this one campus students behaves in this way, then what about the situation of the whole nation.

1518
02:10:58,060 --> 02:11:04,080
eventhough he is a good man one day he will stumble on law & order one day.

1519
02:11:05,760 --> 02:11:07,260
Sir, forgot to tell you.

1520
02:11:07,880 --> 02:11:10,880
there is an information that george met up with naxalites.

1521
02:11:11,380 --> 02:11:14,220
I suspect there are weapons in the campus.

1522
02:11:14,780 --> 02:11:16,000
save me save me...

1523
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,420

save me save me ...

1525
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:22,940

1527
02:11:30,200 --> 02:11:31,740

1537
02:12:28,320 --> 02:12:30,320
"Fight every step of the way for your right!"

1538
02:12:30,580 --> 02:12:32,660
“Learn to die if you want to live"

1539
02:12:32,860 --> 02:12:34,860
"Fight every step of the way for your right!"

“Learn to die if you want to live"

1541
02:12:37,140 --> 02:12:39,340
"Fight every step of the way for your right!"

1542
02:12:46,340 --> 02:12:48,340
its your responsiblity to get all the girls.

1543
02:12:48,700 --> 02:12:49,440
You going to hostel?

1544
02:12:49,440 --> 02:12:50,060
yes George.

1545
02:12:50,380 --> 02:12:51,900
what happened with Rajanna's bail?

1546
02:12:51,900 --> 02:12:52,600
Maaya, lets go..? its getting late.

1547
02:12:52,600 --> 02:12:55,140

1548
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:55,940

1549
02:12:55,940 --> 02:12:56,880

Manipal will drop you both.

1554
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:04,560
I will drop you.

1555
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:06,040
No no we will manage

1556
02:13:06,260 --> 02:13:10,260
