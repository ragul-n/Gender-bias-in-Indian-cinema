1
00:03:17,533 --> 00:03:19,387
United States of America

2
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:21,256
the largest country in the world.

3
00:03:21,844 --> 00:03:25,938
It's got the Statue of Liberty

4
00:03:26,431 --> 00:03:28,619
and liberty to live as well.

5
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:30,557
It's a free country.

6
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,844
Colors, dollars, glamour

7
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,820
entertainment, there's no dearth
of any of these.

8
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,023
Let's check out our hero's entry
into this colorful country.

9
00:04:08,224 --> 00:04:11,210
Oh, lord, you are so weird.

10
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:13,369
Gave me visa to come abroad.

11
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:16,171
Brought me onto pavement
in this foreign land.

12
00:04:16,621 --> 00:04:19,406
I've no food to eat,
no shelter

13
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:21,127
no guts to stay either.

14
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,856
Wonder what do I do now.

15
00:04:54,706 --> 00:04:55,731
Video stopped playing
abruptly.

16
00:04:55,811 --> 00:04:58,032
"Mother, I long to see you."

17
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:01,163
"To see you and father."

18
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:04,527
"To play on dad's lap
and sleep in your arms.."

19
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:06,144
Who is that singing so bad?

20
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,559
"My dear mother."

21
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:20,369
"I lost my way home."

22
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,616
"Lost the hope to return."

23
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:34,840
"No strength to walk,
hunger pangs killing me."

24
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:40,641
"My dear mother."

25
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,217
You are..
- Ullas.

26
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:43,958
And you?
- Me, Jimmy.

27
00:05:44,392 --> 00:05:46,814
You mean doggy's name,
Jimmy? - Yeah.

28
00:05:47,288 --> 00:05:49,147
Where are you from?
- Venkatapuram.

29
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:50,467
I'm from Anantapuram.

30
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:52,521
So we belong to same area.

31
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,504
You're right.

32
00:05:53,584 --> 00:05:55,291
So you're her on a visit?

33
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:56,231
No, wedding.

34
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:57,352
To attend a wedding?

35
00:05:57,432 --> 00:05:58,550
I came after getting married.

36
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,857
Then where's your wife, bro?

37
00:06:00,274 --> 00:06:02,881
She left me on road
over a little issue.

38
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:04,319
These wives are like that.

39
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,888
They constrict us like balloon

40
00:06:07,078 --> 00:06:08,984
while they go free
like hot air balloon.

41
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,425
You mean she's clever

42
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,459
and me an fool?
I'm strong as squall.

43
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,313
Loud-voice is prohibited
in America.

44
00:06:14,393 --> 00:06:15,150
I'm strong as squall.

45
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,519
That doesn't matter how strong
you are

46
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:18,533
once you're married,
you will turn weak.

47
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,304
We marry with a good feel

48
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,305
and they look down on us.

49
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:25,064
Could you buy me some food?

50
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:26,679
I'm starving as hell.

51
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:28,458
"One moment one life."

52
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,381
"To have French fries."

53
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,737
Dude, have it slowly.

54
00:06:36,223 --> 00:06:37,574
Only a brother feeds better

55
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:38,746
next to mother.

56
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:40,157
Who will foot the bill?

57
00:06:40,296 --> 00:06:42,143
Bill is yours,
thrill is mine.

58
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:43,458
Finish it fast.

59
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,710
Will find your wife
and take you to her.

60
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:50,172
So are you a broker?

61
00:06:50,252 --> 00:06:53,074
No, bro.
I'm a brother.

62
00:06:53,154 --> 00:06:56,209
Hanuman went looking for Sita
in Ramayana epic

63
00:06:56,385 --> 00:06:57,966
but you're taking me to my wife.

64
00:06:58,046 --> 00:06:59,585
Rewriting the epic, aren't you?

65
00:06:59,745 --> 00:07:01,599
I'm not a writer,
but a driver.

66
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:02,865
Oh, heck!

67
00:07:02,945 --> 00:07:03,335
A driver?

68
00:07:03,415 --> 00:07:05,197
What irked you?

69
00:07:05,377 --> 00:07:06,498
Anything else, sir?

70
00:07:06,578 --> 00:07:07,539
Hold on a second.

71
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:13,662
How much to pay?

72
00:07:13,742 --> 00:07:14,842
It's fifteen dollars.

73
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,330
Thank you, baby.

74
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,357
Take it.

75
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:18,542
Thank you.

76
00:07:19,619 --> 00:07:22,337
Bro, why speak with finger
in mouth?

77
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,939
That's a little trick to sound
American accent.

78
00:07:28,227 --> 00:07:29,879
I want some water.

79
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:31,297
Sure, sir.

80
00:07:33,013 --> 00:07:35,096
This trick really works.

81
00:07:35,176 --> 00:07:37,469
You'll see more.
Let's go.

82
00:07:39,354 --> 00:07:42,188
So yours is a love marriage
or arranged one?

83
00:07:42,534 --> 00:07:43,791
In fact, both.

84
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,498
How come?

85
00:07:44,578 --> 00:07:46,456
We were in love,
our parents got us married.

86
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:49,321
There's lot more in your story.

87
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:51,017
Anyway

88
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:52,892
tell me your story.

89
00:07:53,507 --> 00:07:56,489
I am from a beautiful village
called Venkatapuram.

90
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:58,287
Usually a heart beats for life

91
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:02,358
while mine beats for money.

92
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:12,212
Boss, we couldn't find Ullas.

93
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:13,403
You didn't find him?

94
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:14,644
No, boss.

95
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:17,824
Play it properly.

96
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:20,508
I'm not A.R.Rehman
to play well, boss.

97
00:08:20,745 --> 00:08:22,045
Just because I didn't pay
a month's interest

98
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,294
you made me sit on ice
and play tabla.

99
00:08:24,374 --> 00:08:26,031
It's veena, not a tabla.

100
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,695
A veena.

101
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:29,891
Can't make the difference
between the two, sitting on ice.

102
00:08:29,971 --> 00:08:31,034
Why you torture me?

103
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:33,552
It's just the beginning.
Borrowing money from me

104
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:36,554
is equal to inviting problems
as hell. Play it properly.

105
00:08:36,735 --> 00:08:38,312
Where is Ullas?

106
00:08:39,467 --> 00:08:42,324
Ullas.
Boss, he gave missed call.

107
00:08:44,373 --> 00:08:45,964
Now he called on my phone.

108
00:08:46,044 --> 00:08:48,164
What does he mean by not
repaying me the money?

109
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:50,219
He meant a barking dog
never bites.

110
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:51,698
Better mind your work.

111
00:08:52,122 --> 00:08:53,489
Dial his number.

112
00:08:56,023 --> 00:08:57,191
It's ringing.

113
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,017
Hello.

114
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:08,340
It's me.

115
00:09:08,729 --> 00:09:10,857
Cast away the egoism
as in 'me'

116
00:09:11,264 --> 00:09:13,114
and embrace brotherhood
as in 'we'.

117
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,420
With same feel I lent you money
but you refuse to pay back?

118
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,443
The fuel expenses to search
for you

119
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:19,829
and the food expenses of my men

120
00:09:19,996 --> 00:09:21,034
I will have you
bear all expenditure.

121
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:22,521
You see, Mr. Patel

122
00:09:22,764 --> 00:09:25,737
Take pride in lending
but beware while asking

123
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:29,770
to repay the amount.
- Remember how much you owe me?

124
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,103
I don't care how much

125
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:36,759
because I've got other plans.

126
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,337
I want my money back.

127
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:41,152
I've got heaps of currency.

128
00:09:42,267 --> 00:09:43,679
Would you collect or shall I bring?

129
00:09:44,004 --> 00:09:45,401
Tell me when or shall I?

130
00:09:45,747 --> 00:09:47,249
At your place or mine?

131
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:49,116
Any time, any place

132
00:09:49,421 --> 00:09:50,438
the cash is ready.

133
00:09:50,825 --> 00:09:52,651
All in two thousand-rupee bills.

134
00:09:58,396 --> 00:09:59,697
You gave me some time ago

135
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:02,603
it's my duty to return it.

136
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:04,539
Tell me where to hand over
the money. - Ullas!

137
00:10:04,968 --> 00:10:06,511
You borrowed money from him

138
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,276
ran business,
and also into losses.

139
00:10:08,356 --> 00:10:10,123
How could you promise him
to pay back?

140
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:13,429
You're treading on razor's edge,
dude.

141
00:10:13,509 --> 00:10:15,851
Come on, I am always running
against the grain, aren't I?

142
00:10:15,931 --> 00:10:17,892
Think practically.

143
00:10:17,972 --> 00:10:20,335
Hi, Mr. Vilas.
This is Boggu Babji

144
00:10:20,415 --> 00:10:22,037
and she's underwear.

145
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:26,139
No, no.
It's underwire.

146
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,966
Yeah, I meant the same.

147
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,133
He's got a piece of cultivated
field in village nearby

148
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,404
she wants to purchase it.

149
00:10:31,484 --> 00:10:33,584
He desperately needs money
and she the land.

150
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:37,389
That's why we'll exchange fifty
million dollars for thirty millions

151
00:10:39,334 --> 00:10:41,954
Is it possible to get money
right now.

152
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:43,744
Don't underestimate our pal.

153
00:10:43,824 --> 00:10:47,813
He's no less than a bank
to aid financially.

154
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:51,558
You sure? Because the banks are
closed for three days in a row.

155
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:53,107
Pretty sure.

156
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,758
Did you get my point?

157
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:57,119
We'll take thirty million
from Patel

158
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:58,546
buy the dollars from them

159
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:01,054
and then sell them to him.
In total

160
00:11:01,134 --> 00:11:03,795
we'd make a profit
of twenty millions.

161
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,951
Even the calculator would envy
your math.

162
00:11:07,031 --> 00:11:08,317
I'm like the liquor

163
00:11:08,397 --> 00:11:09,519
one who sells it gets money

164
00:11:09,599 --> 00:11:11,845
and the one who enjoys
gets high.

165
00:11:22,294 --> 00:11:23,929
What a performance!
- Wow.

166
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,174
Played really well.

167
00:11:25,254 --> 00:11:28,426
Which tune is it?
- Sad tune.

168
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:30,286
Good.
One which scale?

169
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:32,119
Highest possible.
- That's beautiful.

170
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,619
He's a good player.

171
00:11:34,699 --> 00:11:37,654
Your grace resembles that
of a king. - Hey, you.

172
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:39,099
Play the music well.

173
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,264
You look like a dictator.

174
00:11:42,584 --> 00:11:43,856
Come to the matter.

175
00:11:44,981 --> 00:11:46,304
Look at them.

176
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,899
Who are they?
The girl's fair like milk

177
00:11:48,979 --> 00:11:50,343
and he resembles hot chocolate.

178
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:51,727
What a variance.

179
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:53,362
Don't go by their complexion

180
00:11:53,442 --> 00:11:54,936
but by the currency they've got.

181
00:11:55,016 --> 00:11:57,618
They have fifty million rupees
worth dollars.

182
00:11:57,698 --> 00:11:59,590
They want to give it to us
for only thirty millions.

183
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,225
So that profits twenty millions.

184
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,513
Both of us will take ten each

185
00:12:02,593 --> 00:12:03,888
equally.

186
00:12:05,306 --> 00:12:07,476
But you owe me ten millions
already.

187
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,872
Consider my share as repayment.

188
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,516
Come.

189
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:16,359
Sir, poison cannot harm one
with positive thinking

190
00:12:16,439 --> 00:12:19,048
and medicine cannot save the one
with negative thinking.

191
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:20,986
Think positive.

192
00:12:21,263 --> 00:12:23,736
You really worked it out well
to repay the loan.

193
00:12:23,816 --> 00:12:25,803
You helped me accrue good amount.

194
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:27,696
I'm like cane juice

195
00:12:27,776 --> 00:12:30,240
who sells gets money and the one
who drinks it gets strength.

196
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,792
Let us work in partnership
and achieve greater goals.

197
00:12:32,872 --> 00:12:36,225
Trust me, I'll take you to greater
heights.

198
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:36,960
Over there.

199
00:12:43,854 --> 00:12:46,492
Hey, Meena, did you find Ullas?

200
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:47,573
Boss..

201
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,277
Did you find him or not?

202
00:12:49,357 --> 00:12:51,767
We'd been looking for him for past
six months, but in vain.

203
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:54,059
He made me purchase duplicate
dollar bills

204
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:57,483
gave me false hopes of riches
and got me into jail.

205
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,988
I will kill him

206
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:02,354
and only then I shall rest.

207
00:13:02,434 --> 00:13:04,213
That's my challenge.

208
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,967
Net is ready.

209
00:13:08,047 --> 00:13:10,698
Ullas!

210
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:13,760
We're dead meat.

211
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,603
Why bother?

212
00:13:16,683 --> 00:13:19,814
Patel is out of jail,
he'd hack us if found.

213
00:13:19,894 --> 00:13:21,075
What's our mistake?

214
00:13:21,155 --> 00:13:24,509
We never guessed that Boggu Babji
would fool us with fake bills.

215
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:25,667
He cheated Patel

216
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:26,861
that's why he is on vengeance.

217
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:30,147
Do I have to suffer for the sake
of our long time friendship?

218
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,127
Now risking my life
for you.

219
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:34,722
Even gold has to be stricken
with iron to be carved.

220
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:35,839
He's got a point,
answer him.

221
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,309
I might get killed soon.

222
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,290
To hell with your friendship
and partnership.

223
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,764
You see, Bose.
- What?

224
00:13:42,023 --> 00:13:44,903
Partnership is like a trousers

225
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:47,159
while friendship is like
under garment.

226
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:48,984
Even if there's no trousers

227
00:13:49,064 --> 00:13:50,973
you can survive with underwear.

228
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,136
Stop it. I running to save myself.
Bye to your friendship.

229
00:13:56,216 --> 00:13:58,168
I'm going to my aunt's.
- Hey, Bose

230
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:02,215
so we are having a fall out?

231
00:14:02,295 --> 00:14:04,732
I won't be your scapegoat anymore.

232
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:09,904
"God save me from this friendship."
- Bose. Hey, Bose..

233
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:14,659
I've got another sim card.

234
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:17,334
Hello?

235
00:14:17,414 --> 00:14:19,971
So you're released from jail?

236
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:21,709
Who are you speaking?

237
00:14:21,789 --> 00:14:23,067
This is Bose.

238
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:26,483
That fake dollar bills idea
was totally mine

239
00:14:26,563 --> 00:14:29,467
but poor guy Ullas
fell prey to you.

240
00:14:29,547 --> 00:14:31,327
Where are you now?

241
00:14:32,883 --> 00:14:36,991
Oh, please, stop. Don't hit me.

242
00:14:38,938 --> 00:14:39,958
Get down.

243
00:14:40,798 --> 00:14:41,939
Get him!

244
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:44,170
Get him in.

245
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:48,453
Fool!

246
00:14:49,906 --> 00:14:52,812
Oh, God!

247
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:57,716
Sir, please!

248
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:04,732
Finding him is not a cake walk.

249
00:15:04,812 --> 00:15:06,608
By the way who gave you information
about me?

250
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:08,164
Someone called from the phone
number with all one digits.

251
00:15:08,244 --> 00:15:09,914
That number belongs to Ullas.

252
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,910
You can't cheat and get on.

253
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,997
He plays games
not just tricks.

254
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:18,659
Wow!

255
00:15:21,686 --> 00:15:23,704
Boss!

256
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:45,204
I'm in love with him.

257
00:15:45,284 --> 00:15:46,875
How could you love him?

258
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:48,440
He's a cheat.

259
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,282
I'll marry only Ullas.

260
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:55,775
Why are you quiet?
Speak up.

261
00:15:56,324 --> 00:15:57,819
Only audience make noise

262
00:15:58,127 --> 00:15:59,310
while the players play the game
quietly.

263
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:01,214
He's a big lyer.

264
00:16:01,374 --> 00:16:03,731
He cheated our boss who regularly
credits him.

265
00:16:03,811 --> 00:16:05,252
He's bad natured.

266
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:07,659
Applying manure to the plant
doesn't' make flower smell foul.

267
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:10,237
Borrowing money doesn't
make me a bad person.

268
00:16:10,317 --> 00:16:11,756
Am I right?
- I don't know.

269
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:15,112
Marrying a beggar would do good
to her than with you.

270
00:16:15,439 --> 00:16:18,664
Prevention is better than cure.

271
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:21,162
Just look at her innocent face.

272
00:16:26,872 --> 00:16:30,375
Her eyes would make even
a blind to fall in love.

273
00:16:31,871 --> 00:16:33,700
If you get us both married

274
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,430
we'll get you promoted.

275
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:38,118
What?
- I meant if you get us married

276
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,333
we'll give you a baby.

277
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:46,073
Brother-in-law, give me your sister
in marriage.

278
00:16:47,274 --> 00:16:49,712
Please, please.

279
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,388
Oh, my goodness!

280
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:55,384
Thank you, bye.

281
00:16:56,298 --> 00:16:57,681
Bye!

282
00:17:00,877 --> 00:17:02,047
What's happening?

283
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:03,426
You want to know?

284
00:17:03,506 --> 00:17:05,909
Patel's sister shows interest
in me

285
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:07,457
and I need to pay him
the interest.

286
00:17:07,537 --> 00:17:09,350
I'll balance both.

287
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:10,734
How do you know her?

288
00:17:10,814 --> 00:17:12,813
Scared that Patel would attack
me after releasing

289
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,171
I set this up to be on
safe side.

290
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:15,460
Did you inform your parents?

291
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,205
I won't accept this proposal.
- Why wouldn't you?

292
00:17:17,285 --> 00:17:18,060
Why should I?

293
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,765
You aren't settled in life yet

294
00:17:19,845 --> 00:17:21,797
how'd you take care of that
girl on crutches?

295
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:23,786
You're worried about her crutches
and me about the cash.

296
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:25,629
Cash can be deposited in bank

297
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:27,264
but a daughter-in-law needs
to be fit looking after the house.

298
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:31,387
You've got two good legs,
what are you doing with them?

299
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,951
Nothing more than doing chores.

300
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:36,767
How could you promise her marriage?
We won't accept this.

301
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:37,968
You are jealous, brother.

302
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:40,947
jealousy can't be cured.

303
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,165
Are you preaching?

304
00:17:42,245 --> 00:17:44,079
No, you're all insulting me.

305
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:46,635
When to go shopping for marriage
at a short notice?

306
00:17:47,168 --> 00:17:49,950
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

307
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,293
Come hell or high water

308
00:17:51,373 --> 00:17:52,823
I won't accept her
to step in this house.

309
00:17:52,903 --> 00:17:54,363
He'll get her in the wheelchair
instead.

310
00:17:54,443 --> 00:17:56,862
Brother, as a fellow human

311
00:17:56,942 --> 00:18:01,673
have some compassion
towards others.

312
00:18:01,753 --> 00:18:04,789
Father, have you forgotten
what you taught me?

313
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:08,067
He taught you many morals
and ethics.

314
00:18:08,147 --> 00:18:11,431
He doesn't respect his parents
let alone the ethics.

315
00:18:11,511 --> 00:18:13,309
You only treated me as a cook

316
00:18:13,389 --> 00:18:14,995
your father as a moneybag

317
00:18:15,075 --> 00:18:17,434
and your brother as a driver.

318
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:18,939
Have you ever treated this
as a family?

319
00:18:19,019 --> 00:18:21,995
As if ours is a royal family.

320
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:24,036
Is this the way you talk
to elders?

321
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,544
You won't realize now.
When you lose both legs

322
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:29,537
living on wheelchair and brother
gets another woman then you'd know.

323
00:18:29,617 --> 00:18:30,375
Oh, God!

324
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:31,552
Don't preach me.

325
00:18:31,716 --> 00:18:34,006
Have some respect for your
sister-in-law at least.

326
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,362
As a kid I was always with you

327
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,335
more than with our parents

328
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:41,497
yet you don't show a bit
of gratitude.

329
00:18:41,577 --> 00:18:42,745
Oh, brother.

330
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:45,642
Tears of joy are rolling down..
- No, don't.

331
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:46,844
You hold on.

332
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:49,772
I'm seeing humanity in my brother
for first time.

333
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:51,481
I give my consent
to this wedding proposal.

334
00:18:51,561 --> 00:18:53,437
Clean with water.
- Okay, boss.

335
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:57,115
'Hello, Mr. Patel.'

336
00:18:57,384 --> 00:19:00,067
'We like your sister.
You liked my brother.'

337
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,736
'We agree to this wedding.'

338
00:19:01,816 --> 00:19:03,587
'Waiting for your reply.'

339
00:19:03,667 --> 00:19:06,118
Oh, okay!

340
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:09,373
It's an okay!

341
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:16,299
"High time I teach you a lesson."

342
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:17,854
What mess is this
at this late hour?

343
00:19:17,934 --> 00:19:20,587
Won't you let anybody get sleep?

344
00:19:20,667 --> 00:19:22,198
Come, my dear nephew.

345
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,784
You're the right person to share
my frustration.

346
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:27,024
You know that my father hates
drunkards, right?

347
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:28,528
That is why I am drinking.

348
00:19:28,892 --> 00:19:31,418
What is the tiff between him
and you?

349
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:32,672
Twenty five years ago

350
00:19:32,752 --> 00:19:34,774
when my wedding was fixed
with a beautiful lady

351
00:19:34,854 --> 00:19:38,121
your father spoilt the match
saying I was drunkard.

352
00:19:38,201 --> 00:19:39,704
Now I've grown old

353
00:19:39,784 --> 00:19:41,771
and my life useless.

354
00:19:41,968 --> 00:19:45,108
I'd been thinking of a way
to revenge him since then.

355
00:19:45,281 --> 00:19:47,122
In the mean time,
God has done my job.

356
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:48,238
What did he do?

357
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,270
He got an idiot in you.

358
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:51,991
What are you talking?

359
00:19:52,071 --> 00:19:52,960
Absolutely.

360
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,918
I'd been watching your story
on TV since morning.

361
00:19:55,998 --> 00:19:57,146
You watch, too.

362
00:19:57,226 --> 00:20:00,087
I'll get another peg in this happy
mood to share more details.

363
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:03,784
'Ullas Kumar is a cheat.'

364
00:20:04,822 --> 00:20:07,001
'A fraud.'

365
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:11,478
'He's cheated many for money
several times.'

366
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:12,912
'This is not our statement'

367
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:15,887
'but the opposition party leader
and Venkatapuram candidate'

368
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,531
'Teddu Venkataramana's
allegations.'

369
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:19,060
'Here are further details
from him.'

370
00:20:20,442 --> 00:20:22,770
'Everybody is aware of this
miscreant.'

371
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:25,779
'He's been the MLA for this
constituency'

372
00:20:25,966 --> 00:20:27,523
'for four and half years.'

373
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,830
'What good has he done?'

374
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:33,014
'He used up public's money
for his personal use.'

375
00:20:33,934 --> 00:20:35,546
'If he won polls again this time'

376
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:38,846
'I'm afraid the constituency's
condition would only worsen.'

377
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,743
'Mr. Ullas, these are allegations
from the opposition party leader.'

378
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:46,687
'I pity the opposition party
leaders.'

379
00:20:46,936 --> 00:20:49,317
We didn't breed discontent
in public.'

380
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:51,757
'Because they don't have able
candidate'

381
00:20:51,837 --> 00:20:53,623
'with their incapability
to fight us'

382
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,727
'the opposition party is making
false allegations.'

383
00:20:56,807 --> 00:20:58,613
'There is no truth in them.'

384
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:03,546
'Ullas Kumar comments about
opposition leader's allegations.'

385
00:21:03,736 --> 00:21:06,244
Ullas over there
and here.

386
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,882
Ullas!

387
00:21:19,788 --> 00:21:22,097
This must be a new plan
to fool someone.

388
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,231
Why dressed all white?

389
00:21:32,311 --> 00:21:33,805
It's a new change in our lives.

390
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:36,202
We're unable to bear
the consequences of your actions.

391
00:21:36,362 --> 00:21:38,857
Tell me why you dressed up
in whites?

392
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:40,197
I'm entering politics.

393
00:21:40,277 --> 00:21:41,177
Wish you all the best.

394
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:42,466
You, too.
- Why wish me?

395
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:44,888
You will write a book on my
political career someday.

396
00:21:44,968 --> 00:21:45,874
What would be the title?

397
00:21:45,954 --> 00:21:47,672
Your fate!
- We're suffering already.

398
00:21:47,752 --> 00:21:48,529
That will be the tagline.

399
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:49,861
You counterstrike every word.

400
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:50,874
Come to the point.

401
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,328
Ask me.

402
00:21:52,408 --> 00:21:53,530
His name is Ullas Kumar.

403
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,723
Yours, too.

404
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:57,035
Now, if I contest coming elections

405
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,571
public will be confused

406
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,715
his voters number will split
and he will lose. - Then what?

407
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:05,289
Like girls for lips,
politicians for their posts

408
00:22:05,369 --> 00:22:06,561
would go any lengths.

409
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:09,185
But we will just blackmail him
for money.

410
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:10,613
Why are you so mad for money?

411
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:13,436
You will be plundering Patel's
assets by marrying his sister.

412
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:15,408
Money is like vitamin

413
00:22:15,488 --> 00:22:16,812
the more the better.

414
00:22:16,892 --> 00:22:18,556
Long live, Ullas Kumar.

415
00:22:18,636 --> 00:22:20,472
If you win as MLA this time too

416
00:22:20,617 --> 00:22:22,617
you'll definitely get
minister post.

417
00:22:22,977 --> 00:22:24,741
Who'd impede my victory, uncle?

418
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:28,046
Greetings, sir...
- Boss, someone's here..

419
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:32,473
How are you?

420
00:22:32,653 --> 00:22:33,899
Who are you?

421
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,096
He's Ullas Kumar.

422
00:22:36,016 --> 00:22:36,860
So, what?

423
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:38,846
He didn't hear properly.

424
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,148
My name is G. Ullas Kumar.

425
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,017
I asked, so what?

426
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,344
I'm filing nomination
for upcoming elections.

427
00:22:49,424 --> 00:22:51,133
Anybody can file nomination

428
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,794
there's no problem.

429
00:22:53,007 --> 00:22:54,364
Lose those shades and talk.

430
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:59,778
But my nominations will cause
you trouble.

431
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:01,960
Give me five lakh rupees
and I will drop from this.

432
00:23:02,804 --> 00:23:04,440
I will not give.

433
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:09,456
Who am I?
- Ullas.

434
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:13,571
Who is he?
- Ullas, again.

435
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:15,647
Now you get my point?

436
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,378
If I contest elections, too,
voters will get confused

437
00:23:18,458 --> 00:23:19,720
and you will lose.

438
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,517
You better leave from here
immediately.

439
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:25,197
Forget five, let's settle
for two and a half.

440
00:23:25,277 --> 00:23:26,298
I don't mind taking the amount
in installments.

441
00:23:26,378 --> 00:23:27,498
Just get lost!

442
00:23:27,578 --> 00:23:28,575
Listen!

443
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:32,477
Not everyone dressed in white
can be a politician.

444
00:23:32,557 --> 00:23:35,978
Not everybody dressed in black
would be the men in black.

445
00:23:36,058 --> 00:23:36,473
What does it mean?

446
00:23:36,553 --> 00:23:38,523
I don't know,
just to retaliate.

447
00:23:38,603 --> 00:23:39,903
Hey!
- No.

448
00:23:39,983 --> 00:23:41,633
Please, calm down.
Why argue unnecessarily?

449
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,200
We belong to same
constituency

450
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,793
will be crossing paths
in parliament

451
00:23:44,873 --> 00:23:47,034
give fifty thousand rupees and
we'll leave. - 25 for each, enough.

452
00:23:47,114 --> 00:23:51,563
Another second here
I'll kick you out. Get lost!

453
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:55,012
Then I will contest elections

454
00:23:55,092 --> 00:23:56,774
challenge you in public.

455
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,980
The countdown begins.

456
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,580
You challenged him
fearlessly.

457
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,300
Were you scared of him?

458
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,628
Not at all,
having you beside.

459
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:04,855
But I was all tensed up.

460
00:24:04,935 --> 00:24:06,135
His red fierce looks

461
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:07,164
gave chill in my spine.
I thought he'd kill.

462
00:24:07,244 --> 00:24:07,691
Kill you?

463
00:24:07,771 --> 00:24:08,910
No, you.
- Me?

464
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:15,157
Ullas!
- Yes?

465
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,284
Is your job done?

466
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,897
Ask your Ullas to be prepared
for losing the polls.

467
00:24:22,513 --> 00:24:23,835
He's Ullas?

468
00:24:24,228 --> 00:24:25,134
Yes.

469
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:25,841
Sir

470
00:24:25,921 --> 00:24:28,216
Mr. Ullas!

471
00:24:28,296 --> 00:24:28,897
Who's that?

472
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:30,269
Mr. Ullas, it's me.

473
00:24:30,478 --> 00:24:33,354
Oh, you called us?
- Yes. Greetings, sir. - Who's it?

474
00:24:33,434 --> 00:24:34,734
My name is Vespa Vasu

475
00:24:34,814 --> 00:24:36,865
from Chennai.
New broker to the place.

476
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:37,938
A marriage broker.

477
00:24:38,665 --> 00:24:40,515
I'm married already.
- Is it?

478
00:24:40,595 --> 00:24:44,355
I called you up, but your
phone was switched off.

479
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:46,458
It's my phone, my wish.
I won't take calls.

480
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,911
You asked for an alliance
from America.

481
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,724
And now, you tease me
as I am new here?

482
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:54,976
Alliance from America?

483
00:24:55,056 --> 00:24:57,198
I came looking for you.

484
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:58,876
Oh, I see.

485
00:25:00,244 --> 00:25:01,288
Did you get that?
- I didn't.

486
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:03,416
This alliance is for that Ullas.

487
00:25:03,496 --> 00:25:04,731
He thinks it's me.

488
00:25:04,811 --> 00:25:05,933
I'll spoil it.
- What for?

489
00:25:06,013 --> 00:25:07,325
To revenge him.
- Okay.

490
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:09,219
Sir, did you get me?

491
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,521
I remember your caller tune..

492
00:25:12,455 --> 00:25:13,847
Yes, that song.

493
00:25:13,927 --> 00:25:15,577
In his phone right?
- That caller tune is his..

494
00:25:15,657 --> 00:25:16,806
Hey!
- Is in this guy's phone.

495
00:25:16,886 --> 00:25:18,078
Oh!
- His phone.

496
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:20,119
How does the girl look?

497
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,852
The girl's absolutely gold

498
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:23,482
she draws hefty salary

499
00:25:23,634 --> 00:25:24,714
ten thousand altogether.

500
00:25:24,887 --> 00:25:25,888
Just ten thousand rupees?

501
00:25:26,598 --> 00:25:28,590
Ten thousand dollars,
means seven lakh rupees.

502
00:25:29,026 --> 00:25:30,102
Is it?

503
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:31,289
What's the interest amount?

504
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:33,586
It's her monthly salary.

505
00:25:33,821 --> 00:25:35,232
Ullas is quiet funny.

506
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:37,067
Get me fixed to that girl

507
00:25:37,147 --> 00:25:38,703
I'll show my sense of humor.

508
00:25:39,479 --> 00:25:41,501
I am dialing ISD number.

509
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:45,273
"You're finished."

510
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,467
Hi, I'm Ullas.

511
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,432
Are you from Dallas?

512
00:25:49,792 --> 00:25:51,357
Okay, then, good night.

513
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,401
I heard it's day here
and night over there.

514
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:56,796
Hence the greeting.

515
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:58,435
What is your name?

516
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,300
My name is Laya.

517
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,879
Oh, Laya?

518
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:01,841
Not bad.

519
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:03,640
About you?

520
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:04,884
About me?

521
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:09,140
I'll tell you all the good
and bad about me.

522
00:26:09,313 --> 00:26:10,537
I smoke up to three packets

523
00:26:10,617 --> 00:26:12,427
per day easily.

524
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:17,594
And drinks?
- Drinks.

525
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:21,538
I guzzle down one bottle
every day.

526
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,356
You know what?

527
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:26,725
I'm the ambassador of low standard.

528
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:29,004
Your marriage?
- Married once.

529
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:30,304
Want another?

530
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:31,199
Is the girl from America?

531
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,757
No, she's Negro.

532
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,014
Just watch.

533
00:26:35,187 --> 00:26:36,709
I will not let your
marriage take place.

534
00:26:36,876 --> 00:26:38,551
Will ruin your life.

535
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,921
Mr. Vespa, we exchange lot
of secrets already.

536
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:44,850
If you give mutual consent,
my job gets easy.

537
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,995
Your job's almost done.
- How come?

538
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:48,736
Just wait and watch.

539
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:50,110
Hello.

540
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,454
His phone is always switched off,
how is it ringing now?

541
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:53,873
His phone is different.

542
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:55,205
How is that?
- Who knows?

543
00:26:55,285 --> 00:26:56,407
Asking me for reasons.

544
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:58,465
I don't have talk time,
hang up now.

545
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:00,999
Dude, what's our next move?

546
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,556
Look behind.

547
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,564
He's pointing the opposition party.

548
00:27:05,644 --> 00:27:06,397
Let's join there.

549
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:08,222
Long live Jallikattu party.

550
00:27:08,302 --> 00:27:09,303
Long live Jallikattu party.

551
00:27:09,383 --> 00:27:10,946
I won't give you money.

552
00:27:14,112 --> 00:27:16,115
You are not aware of my following.

553
00:27:16,488 --> 00:27:18,017
I've got teachers union
behind my father

554
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:19,599
ladies association behind
my mother

555
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,125
employees union with my brother

556
00:27:21,205 --> 00:27:22,784
and unemployed union
behind me.

557
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:25,668
Besides, I've got support of our
community people.

558
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:29,436
My name is Ullas

559
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:31,006
so is his name too.

560
00:27:31,086 --> 00:27:33,433
If I contest the polls,
they won't accrue loss. - Yes.

561
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:34,400
Explain him.

562
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,487
Look, Mr. Teddu

563
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:37,506
invest on my friend
with complete faith

564
00:27:37,586 --> 00:27:39,123
be rest assured to win.

565
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,985
I'm like a honey comb

566
00:27:42,065 --> 00:27:43,278
you get honey the more
you squeeze it

567
00:27:43,358 --> 00:27:45,267
and money the more you sell it.
Utilize the opportunity.

568
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:46,306
We won't take much.

569
00:27:46,386 --> 00:27:48,624
Give us five hundred per vote
that we get.

570
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:51,343
Our party ethics don't encourage
such tricks.

571
00:27:51,897 --> 00:27:52,894
He's talking about ethics?

572
00:27:52,974 --> 00:27:54,215
My friend is enraged.

573
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:57,170
In that case, we will contest
the polls as independent candidate

574
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:00,117
and smash their party.
Let's go. - Sure.

575
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,385
Mr. Ullas.

576
00:28:03,465 --> 00:28:05,526
We can offer only a hundred
per vote.

577
00:28:07,262 --> 00:28:08,833
But you were talking ethics?

578
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,522
A hundred rupees
can foresee ethics.

579
00:28:12,546 --> 00:28:14,021
That's called politics.

580
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,681
Wonderful!

581
00:28:19,752 --> 00:28:21,154
Our glimmer of hope

582
00:28:21,836 --> 00:28:23,343
the treasure for poor

583
00:28:23,641 --> 00:28:26,076
the future CM of our Telugu states.

584
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:29,832
The candidate from Kappagantula
party

585
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:33,436
our Mr. Ullas will speak now.

586
00:28:37,436 --> 00:28:38,712
Ribbit.

587
00:28:39,254 --> 00:28:40,535
Ribbit.

588
00:28:41,071 --> 00:28:42,637
That's microphone testing.

589
00:28:42,997 --> 00:28:44,478
My dear majors

590
00:28:44,642 --> 00:28:46,061
and minors.

591
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,652
My dear villagers

592
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,243
and the press.

593
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:51,383
How are you doing?

594
00:28:54,374 --> 00:28:55,705
Nobody's reacting to my speech.

595
00:28:56,252 --> 00:28:57,747
How are you all?

596
00:28:57,889 --> 00:28:59,036
A round of applause.

597
00:29:01,733 --> 00:29:03,103
They aren't reacting at all.

598
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:05,269
Shall we imitate film star
Pavan Kalyan? - Perfect.

599
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:10,175
Entire Village is in pitch dark.

600
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:15,016
Roads are full of pits.

601
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,908
We've got no support

602
00:29:20,095 --> 00:29:22,438
than courage filled heart alone.

603
00:29:27,407 --> 00:29:29,118
When frogs croak

604
00:29:29,198 --> 00:29:30,685
only then the farmer can smile.

605
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:32,955
Because when frog croaks
rains fall.

606
00:29:33,288 --> 00:29:34,834
What would a horse neigh give?

607
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:36,520
Nothing more than pain
to the ears.

608
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,480
He seems to split our voters
for real.

609
00:29:42,618 --> 00:29:44,432
'Who let the frogs out?'

610
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:46,628
Come on, baby.
Ribbit, ribbit.

611
00:29:46,779 --> 00:29:48,474
'Who let the frogs out?'

612
00:29:48,554 --> 00:29:49,517
Ribbit, ribbit.

613
00:29:49,597 --> 00:29:50,970
'Who let the frogs out?'

614
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:51,968
Ribbit, ribbit.

615
00:29:52,048 --> 00:29:53,668
'Who let the frogs out?'

616
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:54,466
Ribbit, ribbit.

617
00:29:54,546 --> 00:29:56,109
'Who let the frogs out?'

618
00:29:56,189 --> 00:29:56,775
Ribbit, ribbit.

619
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:58,375
'Who let the frogs out?'

620
00:29:58,455 --> 00:29:59,240
Ribbit, ribbit.

621
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,678
Damn!
Move.

622
00:30:03,245 --> 00:30:06,340
Stick my posters over his.

623
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:09,724
Hey, who is that?

624
00:30:09,994 --> 00:30:10,753
Stop there.

625
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:13,342
Let's go, let's go.

626
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:16,006
How dare you tear down
my poster campaign?

627
00:30:16,086 --> 00:30:17,643
Mr. Ullas.

628
00:30:17,723 --> 00:30:18,768
Hello!

629
00:30:18,848 --> 00:30:19,990
Don't leave them.

630
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,357
Go, catch them.
- Hey, Mr. Ullas.

631
00:30:22,437 --> 00:30:23,450
Thank God.

632
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:27,774
That girl from America said
she couldn't reach your phone.

633
00:30:27,854 --> 00:30:29,482
Everything seems to get upset.

634
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:31,774
She's doubting if you are even
Ullas.

635
00:30:31,854 --> 00:30:32,787
Our idea seems worked out well.

636
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:34,903
She isn't trusting me?
- Not just you

637
00:30:34,983 --> 00:30:36,303
but she is not trusting me, too.

638
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:37,896
I've brought 99 couples together
in marriage

639
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:40,425
setting up hundredth is a piece
of cake for me.

640
00:30:40,648 --> 00:30:41,751
What say?

641
00:30:41,935 --> 00:30:42,940
I'll explain

642
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,823
call the lady now.
- Definitely.

643
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:47,080
I'll put all my efforts together
to unite you two.

644
00:30:47,642 --> 00:30:49,683
Here you go.

645
00:30:50,584 --> 00:30:51,543
Hello.

646
00:30:51,677 --> 00:30:53,385
You wanted to hear my voice?

647
00:30:53,635 --> 00:30:55,662
That's the greatness of my voice

648
00:30:55,932 --> 00:30:57,772
the more you listen,
the more you crave.

649
00:30:57,852 --> 00:30:59,481
Even my parents often

650
00:30:59,561 --> 00:31:01,142
ask me to sing.

651
00:31:01,307 --> 00:31:02,256
Shall I sing for you?

652
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,672
"Let me sing a song for you."

653
00:31:05,752 --> 00:31:08,460
"Be it in or out of tune."

654
00:31:08,744 --> 00:31:10,633
How is it?
Sweet, isn't it?

655
00:31:13,225 --> 00:31:14,700
Are you married?
- No.

656
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,160
Interested?

657
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,944
Not with me.

658
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:21,660
Any girlfriends?

659
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,350
A girl in my life?

660
00:31:23,613 --> 00:31:24,678
You mean

661
00:31:25,561 --> 00:31:27,982
romance and love.

662
00:31:28,855 --> 00:31:30,466
I'll narrate all the love stories
in my teens

663
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:31,718
she'd leave me then.

664
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,160
Once upon a time

665
00:31:34,728 --> 00:31:36,229
there was a village

666
00:31:36,485 --> 00:31:38,698
called Venkatapuram.

667
00:31:42,237 --> 00:31:45,326
There were two kids
in the village.

668
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:51,915
She'd call me Chitti with love.

669
00:31:55,293 --> 00:31:56,943
Chitti, look there.

670
00:31:58,022 --> 00:31:59,600
There is no Palmyra fruit
up there.

671
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,829
Not that.

672
00:32:00,909 --> 00:32:03,577
They say the water in that pot
taste real good.

673
00:32:03,737 --> 00:32:05,248
I want it.

674
00:32:05,328 --> 00:32:07,200
You shouldn't drink that,
it's toddy.

675
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,075
Please, Chitti.

676
00:32:09,236 --> 00:32:11,951
Get me that water
if you really like me.

677
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:13,470
Alright.

678
00:32:40,282 --> 00:32:41,900
Very interesting.

679
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:43,936
Then what happened?

680
00:32:44,016 --> 00:32:46,519
You know what happens
when kids drink toddy?

681
00:32:48,248 --> 00:32:49,318
Delicious, isn't it?

682
00:32:49,795 --> 00:32:50,971
Thank you, Chitti.

683
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,006
Hey, what are you doing?

684
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:56,506
Hey, Laya, come here.

685
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,580
What were doing there?

686
00:33:06,795 --> 00:33:08,126
Would you drink toddy again?
- Don't beat me, dad.

687
00:33:08,206 --> 00:33:10,214
Please, dad, don't beat me.
- I'll thrash you.

688
00:33:10,294 --> 00:33:12,020
Please, don't hit me.

689
00:33:13,508 --> 00:33:16,276
Shut up, you drunkard.
- I won't drink again, please.

690
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,628
Laya.

691
00:33:25,555 --> 00:33:26,745
Get in.

692
00:33:53,121 --> 00:33:55,669
Laya left the village
with her family.

693
00:33:56,091 --> 00:33:59,045
Learnt that they settled abroad.

694
00:34:00,886 --> 00:34:03,038
Haven't you met her again?

695
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,021
No.

696
00:34:04,488 --> 00:34:07,219
So, you've forgotten that girl?

697
00:34:07,855 --> 00:34:12,116
I can never forget her
until my last breath.

698
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:16,281
You know what?

699
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:18,156
Even though she left me

700
00:34:18,779 --> 00:34:22,515
her slate and the broken pot
that day

701
00:34:22,993 --> 00:34:26,493
are still with me as her memoire.

702
00:34:28,272 --> 00:34:29,757
You're really great.

703
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,566
You told everything about yourself
openly.

704
00:34:32,774 --> 00:34:35,619
I like your commitment
towards love.

705
00:34:37,314 --> 00:34:38,635
I like your idea

706
00:34:38,715 --> 00:34:41,368
to be frank with your would-be.

707
00:34:44,741 --> 00:34:46,446
To be honestly speaking

708
00:34:46,644 --> 00:34:49,133
if I married any other girl
than her

709
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,505
she might have space in my house

710
00:34:51,585 --> 00:34:53,131
but not in my heart.

711
00:34:56,134 --> 00:34:57,968
If you like what I told

712
00:34:58,048 --> 00:34:59,922
type BROKER, space

713
00:35:00,002 --> 00:35:01,877
type EES for yes

714
00:35:02,154 --> 00:35:04,981
if you didn't like,
type BROKER, space

715
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,703
type KNOW for no

716
00:35:06,783 --> 00:35:08,303
and send your SMS.

717
00:35:11,814 --> 00:35:12,792
Okay, bye!

718
00:35:12,872 --> 00:35:15,092
Happy Christmas!
Happy Pongal!

719
00:35:15,499 --> 00:35:16,243
I talked to her.

720
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,220
And my trouble?

721
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,267
Will double.

722
00:35:18,618 --> 00:35:20,557
What is it?
- You didn't get?

723
00:35:20,637 --> 00:35:21,704
Get going.

724
00:35:22,378 --> 00:35:25,353
Oh, God! Save me.

725
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,931
Good morning, mom.

726
00:35:34,011 --> 00:35:35,134
Hey, morning.

727
00:35:35,214 --> 00:35:37,261
That mediator guy called me again.

728
00:35:37,451 --> 00:35:38,290
Oh?

729
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:40,408
You remember anyone in India

730
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:42,752
from Venkatapuram?

731
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,819
Venkatapuram?

732
00:35:45,295 --> 00:35:46,402
The teacher's family?

733
00:35:46,482 --> 00:35:47,569
Yeah.

734
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,340
He hasn't forgotten me
even after so long.

735
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:53,985
He's something more, mom.

736
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:56,917
Tea.

737
00:35:58,724 --> 00:35:59,900
How do you feel?

738
00:36:00,151 --> 00:36:02,296
Will this match suit us?

739
00:36:04,026 --> 00:36:06,361
Apparently, that guy still
loves Laya.

740
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:07,995
Besides

741
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,911
I've know that family
for years.

742
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:13,143
Quite decent family.

743
00:36:14,402 --> 00:36:18,348
'Venkatapuram constituency polls
yields unexpected results'

744
00:36:18,428 --> 00:36:19,999
'as Jallikattu party candidate'

745
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,911
'Teddu Venkataramana won with 2000
votes majority.'

746
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,480
'The reason behind the victory
is Ullas.'

747
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,648
'Being a newbie in politics
with some influence, split votes'

748
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:35,724
apparently he stood the reason
for Ullas Kumar's defeat.'

749
00:36:38,974 --> 00:36:40,303
Long live, Jallikattu party.

750
00:36:40,383 --> 00:36:41,756
Long live, Jallikattu party.

751
00:36:41,836 --> 00:36:43,596
Long live, Jallikattu party.

752
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:04,870
Hey, you!

753
00:37:05,284 --> 00:37:06,668
Leave me.

754
00:37:07,056 --> 00:37:09,976
Had it been my victory
I'd have been cabinet minister.

755
00:37:10,056 --> 00:37:12,031
You ruined everything.

756
00:37:12,169 --> 00:37:13,145
I'll pick your eyes.

757
00:37:13,225 --> 00:37:14,238
I won't leave you.

758
00:37:15,587 --> 00:37:17,510
Jealous bugger came to quarrel me.

759
00:37:17,732 --> 00:37:19,648
I'd have rooted out his eyeballs.

760
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:22,901
Have guts to face me.

761
00:37:24,007 --> 00:37:25,861
He is leaving,
you keep quiet.

762
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:29,730
I aim to constrict such corrupts'
from entering politics.

763
00:37:31,057 --> 00:37:32,365
One wrong step

764
00:37:32,445 --> 00:37:34,088
leads in right direction.

765
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,597
You are the right example
for that.

766
00:37:35,677 --> 00:37:36,752
What are you talking?

767
00:37:36,832 --> 00:37:38,018
That girl from America

768
00:37:38,098 --> 00:37:40,550
wants to marry only you.

769
00:37:40,709 --> 00:37:44,778
Patel's sister is average
and the American is above average.

770
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:47,933
That girl's seventy times better
than this.

771
00:37:48,153 --> 00:37:50,167
You mean seventy times wealthier?

772
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:56,415
Sir, she said they've known you
since childhood.

773
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:59,896
Got connected to your love story
she is insisting to marry you.

774
00:37:59,976 --> 00:38:02,580
She's coming all the way
from America for you.

775
00:38:49,925 --> 00:38:51,308
Welcome.
How are you doing?

776
00:38:51,388 --> 00:38:53,965
How are you?
- It's been long since we met.

777
00:39:04,649 --> 00:39:06,974
Where are you off to?
Would you marry her?

778
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,983
How can I reject when dollar
knocking my door?

779
00:39:10,063 --> 00:39:12,599
You open gates here
and Patel will close you forever.

780
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:13,484
Then forget it.

781
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:16,197
I thought of gifting you half
the assets after marrying Laya.

782
00:39:17,061 --> 00:39:19,414
I'm pledging my life
for you, dude.

783
00:39:19,642 --> 00:39:21,462
I'll manage Patel,
you go ahead.

784
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:24,706
I don't know how to accept
your proposal for my son.

785
00:39:24,851 --> 00:39:27,467
Did you enquire about him
before coming down?

786
00:39:27,547 --> 00:39:29,397
Do we really need to know
your family afresh?

787
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:31,009
By the way, Ullas,
what are you up to these days?

788
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:33,161
I'd go any lengths for my family.

789
00:39:33,964 --> 00:39:36,316
He's got immense respect
for family.

790
00:39:36,396 --> 00:39:39,465
Respect? Really?
He writes with most blunders

791
00:39:39,665 --> 00:39:41,076
gets vegetables mostly rotten.

792
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:44,190
He was called book worm

793
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,473
and his books were always
eaten up by worms.

794
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,646
If he is like oxygen,
this fellow is poison.

795
00:39:48,791 --> 00:39:51,344
Poison fragrance has got
huge craze abroad, sir.

796
00:39:51,531 --> 00:39:52,970
He is right match for this girl.

797
00:39:54,707 --> 00:39:57,966
We left Laya's decision
about marriage to herself.

798
00:39:58,782 --> 00:39:59,737
Tell them.

799
00:40:00,532 --> 00:40:02,124
We are okay with this match.

800
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,868
If you like, too

801
00:40:04,545 --> 00:40:06,212
let's get the wedding date fixed.

802
00:40:06,468 --> 00:40:08,101
We like it.
- Very good.

803
00:40:12,258 --> 00:40:13,739
Bye!

804
00:40:15,067 --> 00:40:16,894
Stop waving,
get off the tree.

805
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:20,747
What's making you shy

806
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:23,321
shamelessly?
You disgraced us all.

807
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:24,864
What wrong did I do?
- Don't you know?

808
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:26,669
You promised marriage to Patel's
sister

809
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:28,309
and now you decide to marry
this girl for her money?

810
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:30,433
You earn ten thousand rupees
as a teacher

811
00:40:30,513 --> 00:40:32,910
if you're offered promotion with
double pay, would you reject?

812
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,629
You talked like a humanitarian
that day

813
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:37,463
and now you're talking
cruelly?

814
00:40:37,543 --> 00:40:38,763
For that human values

815
00:40:38,843 --> 00:40:41,267
I'm pledging myself
for your better lives.

816
00:40:41,455 --> 00:40:42,742
Am I wrong, mom?

817
00:40:42,822 --> 00:40:44,070
You are always wrong, son.

818
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,261
You didn't get my point.

819
00:40:45,341 --> 00:40:49,371
I fixed your marriage
with Patel's sister

820
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:50,637
what will happen to me?

821
00:40:50,717 --> 00:40:53,086
You should think while typing
message not after sending.

822
00:40:53,166 --> 00:40:54,284
Now I understand

823
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,415
that I'm a dead meat.

824
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,882
Rescue me.

825
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,293
We can save someone
from problems

826
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,891
not from trouble.

827
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:02,800
Moreover, Patel is not a gentleman.

828
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,288
He might attack you any moment.

829
00:41:04,368 --> 00:41:05,547
Sister-in-law, take care
of brother.

830
00:41:06,184 --> 00:41:07,076
Bye, dad

831
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:08,003
bye, mom

832
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,249
bye, mother-like.

833
00:41:09,329 --> 00:41:10,473
What's mother-like?

834
00:41:10,553 --> 00:41:12,334
Sister-in-law is equal to mother.

835
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,444
That's mother-like.

836
00:41:14,524 --> 00:41:15,579
Dear, tell me

837
00:41:15,659 --> 00:41:18,063
is he your brother
or a bomber? - Come on.

838
00:41:18,388 --> 00:41:20,339
Bomber is never so cruel.

839
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:22,871
I'm sure he'll get me beheaded
some day.

840
00:41:26,085 --> 00:41:27,925
What do you remember
seeing this?

841
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:30,368
This looks like a pillar.

842
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:33,932
This is a tree,
not a pillar. You forgotten?

843
00:41:34,166 --> 00:41:37,812
As kids, we played, sang
under this tree

844
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:39,853
drank toddy as well.

845
00:41:39,933 --> 00:41:41,900
Then where is the top?

846
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,758
They cut it.

847
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:45,892
When they tried to cut the trunk
I stopped them.

848
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:48,923
This tree may die

849
00:41:49,179 --> 00:41:52,652
but my memories are always
fresh and sprouting.

850
00:42:02,222 --> 00:42:04,567
This match is almost set for me.

851
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,488
Ullas!

852
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,276
Remember what you told me
that day?

853
00:42:08,356 --> 00:42:09,189
About what?

854
00:42:09,269 --> 00:42:11,313
The broken pot,
old sandals

855
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:13,735
my hair strands,
dress, all that you stored.

856
00:42:13,815 --> 00:42:15,354
Why do you need them now?

857
00:42:15,434 --> 00:42:16,911
I'd like to see them once.

858
00:42:17,659 --> 00:42:18,261
Please.

859
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:21,166
Nobody else in the world would
do like this except you.

860
00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:25,670
When my dad asked me

861
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,218
what's the clutter

862
00:42:27,298 --> 00:42:29,706
I told him it's not clutter
but my memoire

863
00:42:29,786 --> 00:42:32,310
took them and stored it
at my friend Bose's place.

864
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:34,950
Please, let's got there.
I want to see that.

865
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:37,294
Oh, pal, Bose!

866
00:42:37,374 --> 00:42:39,059
Alright, buddy.

867
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:43,652
"I'd do anything for my friend."

868
00:42:43,732 --> 00:42:46,818
Bose, stop it.

869
00:42:47,243 --> 00:42:48,852
Why are you taking them?

870
00:42:49,976 --> 00:42:51,048
What is all this?

871
00:42:51,128 --> 00:42:52,553
Sacrifice.

872
00:42:52,633 --> 00:42:53,470
What do you want?

873
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:54,724
Go, get your granny's sari.

874
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:57,335
That's old one.
- You aren't new as well.

875
00:43:11,813 --> 00:43:13,396
What you're doing.

876
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:18,282
The artist in your husband
has just woken up.

877
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:22,139
Hold yourself from praising me,
I don't like it.

878
00:43:32,427 --> 00:43:33,734
He's my friend, Bose.

879
00:43:33,814 --> 00:43:35,968
My closest buddy, always with me
like attached bathroom.

880
00:43:36,048 --> 00:43:38,779
What a simile!
- Hi.

881
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:39,635
Hi.

882
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:41,150
Welcome to my little mansion.

883
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,602
This sweety is my wife.

884
00:43:42,741 --> 00:43:43,647
Greetings.

885
00:43:43,727 --> 00:43:44,456
Hi.

886
00:43:44,536 --> 00:43:46,864
Like the village has got a dam

887
00:43:46,944 --> 00:43:49,051
my buddy's got a room
in my house. - I know.

888
00:43:49,131 --> 00:43:50,518
He brought me here to show
the same.

889
00:43:50,598 --> 00:43:51,915
It's ready, please come in.

890
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:54,627
I meant, step in with your right
and come.

891
00:43:56,581 --> 00:43:57,445
Where did you set up?

892
00:43:57,525 --> 00:43:59,389
The bathroom. I mean the bedroom
beside bathroom.

893
00:43:59,469 --> 00:44:00,054
Thank goodness.

894
00:44:10,259 --> 00:44:11,193
Oh, God!

895
00:44:12,377 --> 00:44:13,553
Oh, my..
- What?

896
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:18,658
I always pray to God before
entering this room.

897
00:44:25,558 --> 00:44:28,256
This looks like a stall
in carnival.

898
00:44:28,336 --> 00:44:30,339
Don't call carnival,
it's my love stall.

899
00:44:30,419 --> 00:44:31,716
You mean, love store?

900
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:32,851
Yeah.

901
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:37,260
I don't remember
using these.

902
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:39,287
But we do remember.

903
00:44:39,367 --> 00:44:40,747
Surprisingly.

904
00:44:41,151 --> 00:44:42,230
What's this?

905
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:45,814
It's the lamp.
He fuels daily to keep it burning.

906
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:47,806
It's not the oil that he pours

907
00:44:48,042 --> 00:44:49,647
but the fuel to his love.

908
00:44:49,924 --> 00:44:51,356
Salutation to the love gown.

909
00:44:52,421 --> 00:44:55,334
How can someone love
anybody so much?

910
00:44:56,102 --> 00:44:57,576
He isn't that type..
- Yes..

911
00:44:57,656 --> 00:44:58,288
He's right.

912
00:44:58,368 --> 00:45:00,226
In fact, I love very much.

913
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:00,848
You know

914
00:45:00,928 --> 00:45:03,733
this is the pot
we've broken as kids.

915
00:45:03,813 --> 00:45:05,227
When stood under the tree

916
00:45:05,307 --> 00:45:07,303
and guzzled toddy, didn't we?

917
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:09,843
We bought this in funfair

918
00:45:10,674 --> 00:45:11,732
our very own ray ban shades.

919
00:45:12,611 --> 00:45:14,520
And this, love flute.

920
00:45:20,548 --> 00:45:21,246
Do you know

921
00:45:21,326 --> 00:45:22,658
this is slingshot.

922
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:25,930
Then what about the gown?

923
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:27,328
It's my granny's.

924
00:45:28,926 --> 00:45:32,897
I wanted to gift you on your
birthday, but you left already.

925
00:45:32,977 --> 00:45:36,530
Is it? All these remind me
of childhood days.

926
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,201
It reminds us too.
- Surprisingly.

927
00:45:39,575 --> 00:45:41,927
Ullas, I want to talk
to you in person.

928
00:45:49,932 --> 00:45:50,963
Why did you stop here?

929
00:45:51,178 --> 00:45:53,669
This is the right place for you
both to share feelings.

930
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:56,790
This is an expensive place.
- Spend a little now, at least

931
00:45:59,184 --> 00:46:01,178
Ullas.
- Coming.

932
00:46:01,572 --> 00:46:02,478
What's it, Laya?

933
00:46:02,558 --> 00:46:05,032
I like that place.
- There?

934
00:46:05,112 --> 00:46:06,927
Excellent one.
- Let's go.

935
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:09,045
Hi.

936
00:46:09,488 --> 00:46:11,301
Be seated.
- She's from America.

937
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:12,844
Food is fresh, right?

938
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:19,043
Natural drink.

939
00:46:19,507 --> 00:46:20,780
It takes up our emotions

940
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:22,282
until starts bowel movement.

941
00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:24,012
Tree milk, the toddy.

942
00:46:24,309 --> 00:46:26,205
Don't drink much.
He can't have it more.

943
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:27,416
Really?

944
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,488
Who told you

945
00:46:28,568 --> 00:46:30,598
that my capacity is low?
Look at me and speak.

946
00:46:32,811 --> 00:46:34,554
Hey, don't guzzle it down.

947
00:46:34,907 --> 00:46:36,001
Stop it, buddy.

948
00:46:37,952 --> 00:46:39,703
Take one more bottle.

949
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:45,640
We want to have a private talk.

950
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,231
Go ahead, I'll listen.

951
00:46:48,303 --> 00:46:49,839
Why are you here in between us?

952
00:46:50,587 --> 00:46:53,624
You like that five star hotel
in the opposite, don't you?

953
00:46:53,704 --> 00:46:54,883
Go there.

954
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:56,696
Here you go, enjoy yourself.

955
00:46:56,862 --> 00:46:57,678
Okay?

956
00:46:57,758 --> 00:46:59,261
Indian rupees are very expensive.

957
00:46:59,341 --> 00:47:01,197
Bye.
- Please, go.

958
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,791
Want personal talk without
me knowing?

959
00:47:07,251 --> 00:47:08,054
Now, tell me.

960
00:47:08,134 --> 00:47:11,832
Since I spent all my childhood
in America..

961
00:49:58,237 --> 00:50:00,226
Ullas..

962
00:50:03,006 --> 00:50:05,064
Think well and let me know
your decision tomorrow.

963
00:50:05,144 --> 00:50:07,598
One should think before loving
someone

964
00:50:07,927 --> 00:50:10,158
but not after loving.

965
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:16,757
I love you.

966
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:24,782
Dear, Patel is here.

967
00:50:24,862 --> 00:50:26,810
Hang on. You don't let me sleep
in night and day either.

968
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:28,761
If he enters inside
you will never sleep again.

969
00:50:28,841 --> 00:50:31,813
Patel?
- Patel is here?

970
00:50:32,124 --> 00:50:33,570
So Patel is here?

971
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,728
Why ask again?

972
00:50:35,808 --> 00:50:37,340
He didn't come to hug you

973
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:39,844
but to question about your wedding.
What do I answer him?

974
00:50:40,059 --> 00:50:43,131
Did I ever speak in front of
all your elder people?

975
00:50:43,518 --> 00:50:44,875
You go and talk to him.

976
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,358
Come out! Patel has come.

977
00:50:50,185 --> 00:50:51,548
Give him the rope.

978
00:50:54,947 --> 00:50:56,863
Move away,
I have to do skipping.

979
00:50:59,937 --> 00:51:01,597
How are you, brother-in-law?

980
00:51:01,791 --> 00:51:03,922
I heard that you're getting Ullas
married to a foreign girl

981
00:51:04,002 --> 00:51:05,604
instead of my sister?

982
00:51:06,427 --> 00:51:07,728
I told him

983
00:51:07,808 --> 00:51:11,720
how sacred and precious
marriage is.

984
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,605
But he is preferring the girl
from America.

985
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:22,953
Why are you giggling?

986
00:51:28,072 --> 00:51:30,078
I came to give you a bank cheque

987
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:33,164
get him married in grandeur
with whoever you wish.

988
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,010
If boss is happy,
he'll connect to the humor

989
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:38,691
otherwise, it's danger.

990
00:51:38,771 --> 00:51:40,600
You connected with him
like a cartoon family

991
00:51:40,829 --> 00:51:41,707
carry on.

992
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,728
There must not be any impediment
in the wedding.

993
00:51:43,808 --> 00:51:45,865
I'm taking my sister to Rajasthan.

994
00:51:46,024 --> 00:51:47,235
Meena, give him the blank cheque.

995
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:53,401
Oh, Bose, my friend.

996
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:54,390
Yes, buddy.

997
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:55,552
Arrange everything well.

998
00:51:55,632 --> 00:51:57,406
Don't worry, I'll take care
of everything.

999
00:52:01,253 --> 00:52:02,636
I'll give you a different
punishment.

1000
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:04,567
Let's go.
- Sorry, sir.

1001
00:52:05,404 --> 00:52:08,905
We thought he'd kill us
but gave us a cheque?

1002
00:52:08,985 --> 00:52:10,365
What magic did you weave?

1003
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,849
Just wait and watch.

1004
00:52:18,997 --> 00:52:19,807
Life it.

1005
00:52:20,852 --> 00:52:22,070
Boss, boss.

1006
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:24,145
Ullas, is getting ready to marry

1007
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:25,786
some girl from abroad
instead of your sister.

1008
00:52:25,866 --> 00:52:27,385
Hey, Ullas!

1009
00:52:30,095 --> 00:52:31,133
Brother-in-law

1010
00:52:32,302 --> 00:52:35,685
my family wants to get me
married to another girl.

1011
00:52:35,765 --> 00:52:38,453
They said okay to her,
she gave this bouquet to me.

1012
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:40,300
You loved my sister

1013
00:52:40,557 --> 00:52:42,259
now if you marry someone else

1014
00:52:42,339 --> 00:52:44,895
I'll kill your entire family.

1015
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,046
They said the same, too.

1016
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:49,516
If I married your sister

1017
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:53,422
they threatened to set themselves
ablaze

1018
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:55,114
or they'd hang themselves.

1019
00:52:55,958 --> 00:52:58,497
In such conditions, your sister
will never get married ever.

1020
00:52:58,706 --> 00:53:00,104
Then what do we do?

1021
00:53:00,184 --> 00:53:03,294
You go to your native place,
Rajasthan immediately.

1022
00:53:03,466 --> 00:53:05,549
Look for a good temple.

1023
00:53:05,629 --> 00:53:07,369
Fix the wedding date.

1024
00:53:07,449 --> 00:53:10,675
I'll escape from here
and come at the right time.

1025
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:12,713
Once the marriage is done,
they will not do anything

1026
00:53:12,793 --> 00:53:16,546
cause, there won' be any use,
and you'll have nothing to lose.

1027
00:53:16,626 --> 00:53:18,484
It's my duty to save
your sister's future

1028
00:53:18,564 --> 00:53:21,071
from my torturous family,
isn't it?

1029
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:25,098
What an idiot you are
to spoil family's reputation.

1030
00:53:25,178 --> 00:53:26,758
Even a wise man would
swear you.

1031
00:53:26,838 --> 00:53:28,522
I will do the honors.

1032
00:53:28,808 --> 00:53:31,402
How was my idea
to escape from Patel?

1033
00:53:31,482 --> 00:53:32,641
First, change your decision

1034
00:53:32,721 --> 00:53:34,834
Patel's sister is right match
for you, not Laya.

1035
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:36,002
Is it?
- Yes.

1036
00:53:36,369 --> 00:53:37,552
I guessed it

1037
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,597
when you moved close
with Patel

1038
00:53:40,677 --> 00:53:42,728
that you'd do anything
for money.

1039
00:53:42,808 --> 00:53:44,106
Me for money?

1040
00:53:44,186 --> 00:53:46,915
I filmed the conversation
Laya and you had.

1041
00:53:46,995 --> 00:53:50,519
You filmed a couple's conversation.

1042
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:51,758
To blackmail me?

1043
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:53,944
That's not my idea,
check the video once.

1044
00:53:54,024 --> 00:53:56,685
Let alone video, I shall
never see you again, get out!

1045
00:53:56,765 --> 00:53:57,806
Then I won't attend your wedding.

1046
00:53:57,886 --> 00:53:59,507
I'll break your legs
if you attended.

1047
00:53:59,587 --> 00:54:00,407
Get lost!

1048
00:54:00,635 --> 00:54:01,576
Dude..

1049
00:54:08,653 --> 00:54:10,279
Don't fake emotions.

1050
00:54:14,728 --> 00:54:15,980
Hey, buddy!

1051
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:19,157
My wedding should be held
in grandeur.

1052
00:54:19,378 --> 00:54:21,392
You must attend with your family.

1053
00:54:21,472 --> 00:54:23,931
I don't encourage presents.

1054
00:54:25,585 --> 00:54:27,383
I'm so happy, Ullas.

1055
00:54:27,723 --> 00:54:30,110
Never been so content
in life so far.

1056
00:54:30,311 --> 00:54:31,342
Me, too.

1057
00:54:31,422 --> 00:54:32,760
Many a guys

1058
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,881
look forward to the dowry
in marriage

1059
00:54:35,961 --> 00:54:37,880
than the salary they earn.

1060
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:42,841
Until now several people
have shocked me

1061
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:45,380
but you surprised me.

1062
00:54:46,557 --> 00:54:48,231
And you encouraged me.

1063
00:54:48,311 --> 00:54:49,636
It's easy to fall in love

1064
00:54:49,716 --> 00:54:51,926
but staying isn't so.

1065
00:54:52,209 --> 00:54:55,763
You've been loving me
since childhood

1066
00:54:56,022 --> 00:54:58,021
kept my things as memoire.

1067
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,460
You concealed my image
in your heart.

1068
00:55:00,783 --> 00:55:03,931
You're marrying me despite
knowing everything about me.

1069
00:55:04,011 --> 00:55:05,356
You're great.

1070
00:55:06,642 --> 00:55:09,850
I never got anything
that I preferred in life.

1071
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:11,633
You're the first that I got.

1072
00:55:13,017 --> 00:55:15,507
Boy's love stays until marriage

1073
00:55:15,587 --> 00:55:18,050
but girl's love begins in marriage.

1074
00:55:19,044 --> 00:55:21,509
But our love that sprouted
as kids

1075
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:23,654
must stay till the end.

1076
00:55:25,375 --> 00:55:28,921
I want be happy until
my last breath.

1077
00:55:41,281 --> 00:55:43,088
You look gorgeous.

1078
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:46,375
Are you drunk?
- Yes.

1079
00:55:46,455 --> 00:55:47,715
You, bloody drunkard.

1080
00:55:47,795 --> 00:55:49,886
I let him attend the wedding
on your request

1081
00:55:49,966 --> 00:55:51,357
but I don't like him.

1082
00:55:51,437 --> 00:55:52,879
Stay away from the bride.

1083
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:54,568
Ma'am

1084
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,956
we booked tickets to America
for the couple.

1085
00:55:57,189 --> 00:55:58,426
And we don't have enough time

1086
00:55:58,506 --> 00:55:59,628
will be leaving tomorrow.

1087
00:55:59,708 --> 00:56:02,284
Why don't you stay another
ten days?

1088
00:56:02,570 --> 00:56:05,363
We got to arrange everything
before they fly to America.

1089
00:56:05,579 --> 00:56:08,389
So my brother will be living
separately?

1090
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:09,853
That's common in America.

1091
00:56:18,646 --> 00:56:20,601
Why didn't you attend marriage?

1092
00:56:20,681 --> 00:56:21,942
Did you attend?
- Yes.

1093
00:56:22,022 --> 00:56:23,827
How did it go?
- Really well.

1094
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,193
And why did you miss?

1095
00:56:25,375 --> 00:56:26,793
He said he'll break my legs
if attended.

1096
00:56:26,873 --> 00:56:27,909
He said that?
Let me ask him.

1097
00:56:27,989 --> 00:56:29,985
Stop, don't tell this to anybody.

1098
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,168
What's this?

1099
00:56:39,248 --> 00:56:41,443
A gift, take it.
- For me? Thanks.

1100
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,758
Enjoy.

1101
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:50,439
I saw wedding nights
in movies

1102
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:53,120
but watching it real
for the first time.

1103
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,412
Wonder how it's going to be.

1104
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:56,701
Laya

1105
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,468
don't know where and how
to begin.

1106
00:56:59,813 --> 00:57:01,258
But I'll do first

1107
00:57:01,647 --> 00:57:02,849
otherwise she'd know it.

1108
00:57:06,732 --> 00:57:07,951
What's that, Shailu?

1109
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:09,336
Milk.

1110
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,962
Okay, now, leave.

1111
00:57:36,097 --> 00:57:37,204
What's that?

1112
00:57:37,792 --> 00:57:38,579
Gift.

1113
00:57:38,804 --> 00:57:39,609
Who gave you?

1114
00:57:39,689 --> 00:57:40,482
Uncle.

1115
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:41,744
I see.

1116
00:57:41,824 --> 00:57:43,613
Oh, I'm so tired.

1117
00:58:12,145 --> 00:58:13,134
Laya!

1118
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:15,299
What? Don't want soda?

1119
00:58:15,379 --> 00:58:16,220
Laya

1120
00:58:16,737 --> 00:58:17,761
what's this?

1121
00:58:20,182 --> 00:58:22,196
Come on. Cheers!

1122
00:58:28,942 --> 00:58:31,799
Shouldn't wait once
you give cheers.

1123
00:58:31,938 --> 00:58:32,914
Come on.

1124
00:58:34,007 --> 00:58:35,909
You said you drink full
every day, didn't you?

1125
00:58:36,124 --> 00:58:37,238
Drink it off.

1126
00:58:44,463 --> 00:58:45,584
Come on!

1127
00:58:54,038 --> 00:58:54,847
Yeah.

1128
00:59:15,225 --> 00:59:16,152
Ullas.

1129
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:19,771
Hey

1130
00:59:20,041 --> 00:59:20,961
you know what

1131
00:59:21,417 --> 00:59:23,977
I love you so much.

1132
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:24,817
My bad luck.

1133
00:59:24,897 --> 00:59:27,141
After knowing everything
about me

1134
00:59:27,452 --> 00:59:30,046
once learning everything
about my past

1135
00:59:30,126 --> 00:59:32,440
you just continued to love me.

1136
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:34,225
You know

1137
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:38,038
maybe this is the true love.

1138
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,764
I love you so much.

1139
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:42,598
Thank you.

1140
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:55,546
Bose, my friend,
it's all my loss.

1141
00:59:58,445 --> 00:59:59,649
Stop playing that song.

1142
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:11,869
Hey, don't even touch the gate.

1143
01:00:13,066 --> 01:00:15,508
Don't step in otherwise,
I'll unchain the dog.

1144
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,210
I know you don't have dogs.

1145
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:20,089
I'll bite you myself like dog.

1146
01:00:20,169 --> 01:00:21,819
Don't be funny.

1147
01:00:22,558 --> 01:00:26,101
I won't accept an immoral like you
to sit in the chair.

1148
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:27,442
As if this were a royal throne.

1149
01:00:27,522 --> 01:00:28,625
No, it's mine.

1150
01:00:28,705 --> 01:00:30,438
He's come for first time
post marriage

1151
01:00:30,518 --> 01:00:31,967
why shout at him.

1152
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:33,489
Have some tea, sir.

1153
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,522
You go inside.

1154
01:00:35,602 --> 01:00:37,300
Why offer even a tea for you?

1155
01:00:43,258 --> 01:00:45,251
You always snatch my food.

1156
01:00:45,331 --> 01:00:46,580
Why didn't you attend
my wedding?

1157
01:00:46,660 --> 01:00:48,711
What? Come again.

1158
01:00:48,791 --> 01:00:50,924
Are you trying to threaten me?

1159
01:00:51,004 --> 01:00:51,933
How could you be double
tongued?

1160
01:00:52,013 --> 01:00:52,930
Can you speak truth
even for a while?

1161
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:55,766
It's you who threaten to break
my legs if I came.

1162
01:00:55,846 --> 01:00:58,308
I did, so, you'd miss
just like that?

1163
01:00:58,515 --> 01:01:00,819
Didn't I shamelessly come here,
even while you were speaking ill?

1164
01:01:00,999 --> 01:01:01,961
Buddy

1165
01:01:02,549 --> 01:01:04,652
Amitabh Bacchan hails
from Bollywood

1166
01:01:04,868 --> 01:01:06,341
Chiranjeevi from Tollywood

1167
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:07,608
but our friendship

1168
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,014
is from childhood.

1169
01:01:11,151 --> 01:01:12,142
Ullas, my friend.

1170
01:01:12,222 --> 01:01:12,901
Shoo.

1171
01:01:13,438 --> 01:01:15,985
You know friendship is like paste

1172
01:01:16,146 --> 01:01:17,745
squeezing it out is easy

1173
01:01:17,825 --> 01:01:19,516
but putting it back is not.

1174
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:23,945
I hereby cancel our friendship
all these years.

1175
01:01:26,154 --> 01:01:27,183
Bye, my dear soul mate.

1176
01:01:27,263 --> 01:01:30,167
Why do you treat me
like a doormat that you tread on?

1177
01:01:30,247 --> 01:01:32,862
I'm your classmate.
Deepa, get some tea.

1178
01:01:32,942 --> 01:01:35,833
Ask once again for tea,
will throw boiling water on you.

1179
01:01:35,913 --> 01:01:37,881
I married her offer dowry
in turn and she..

1180
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:39,624
Bose, my buddy.

1181
01:01:39,895 --> 01:01:42,004
You wanted to show me something
that day

1182
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:43,460
what was that?

1183
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:45,431
That was the reason for our tiff,
forget it.

1184
01:01:45,511 --> 01:01:48,764
You know, my marriage
seems getting into trouble now.

1185
01:01:48,997 --> 01:01:52,158
I don't remember a bit
what she told me.

1186
01:01:52,238 --> 01:01:53,835
Then why not forget it.

1187
01:01:53,915 --> 01:01:56,923
Amitabh hails from Bollywood,
and our friendship.. - Hold on.

1188
01:01:58,678 --> 01:02:01,454
Take this, play the video.

1189
01:02:02,651 --> 01:02:05,647
'My life is all disturbed since
childhood.'

1190
01:02:05,727 --> 01:02:07,557
'That led me to alcohol
addiction.'

1191
01:02:08,871 --> 01:02:11,404
'I can't survive a day
without alcohol.'

1192
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:16,398
'You told me everything about you
frankly, now it's my turn.

1193
01:02:16,715 --> 01:02:20,486
'Cause I don't want any
issues between us post marriage.'

1194
01:02:21,565 --> 01:02:23,191
What a clarity she's got.

1195
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:27,322
My parents hope that marrying an
Indian would change me for better.

1196
01:02:28,746 --> 01:02:31,029
But I know it very well

1197
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:33,652
that knowing about me
no senseless man would marry me.

1198
01:02:34,205 --> 01:02:35,811
She's saying you're senseless.

1199
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,025
I'll drink even after marriage

1200
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:40,654
can't help it.
Now, tell me

1201
01:02:40,987 --> 01:02:42,440
do you still love me?

1202
01:02:42,861 --> 01:02:45,117
Would you marry me?

1203
01:02:45,497 --> 01:02:46,563
Just be frank.

1204
01:02:46,944 --> 01:02:49,427
She's given so many conditions

1205
01:02:49,593 --> 01:02:51,925
had you rejected her
there wouldn't have been problems.

1206
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:55,558
Come on, dude.

1207
01:02:55,883 --> 01:02:56,873
Stop crying

1208
01:02:57,156 --> 01:02:58,630
don't cry like a kid.

1209
01:02:58,845 --> 01:03:00,311
Marriage is like a lottery

1210
01:03:00,596 --> 01:03:02,000
if hit jackpot
you'll be happy

1211
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,366
otherwise, you'll be left
with BP.

1212
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:08,528
My father doesn't allow
my uncle inside

1213
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:10,638
just because he's alcoholic.

1214
01:03:10,718 --> 01:03:13,138
Now, if he knew that Laya
also drinks alcohol

1215
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:15,430
God knows what will happen.

1216
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:18,604
Ullas.

1217
01:03:19,494 --> 01:03:21,760
Instead of sitting at home

1218
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,914
why you roaming around
on bike.

1219
01:03:23,994 --> 01:03:25,834
Why are you asking me
silly questions?

1220
01:03:25,914 --> 01:03:27,114
What are you so excited?

1221
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,280
I thought your bride will be
arrogant and proud

1222
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:31,836
but she seems to be
calm and polite.

1223
01:03:31,916 --> 01:03:33,453
Then start worshipping her.

1224
01:03:33,533 --> 01:03:34,777
We needn't do that

1225
01:03:34,857 --> 01:03:36,722
in fact she's showing immense
love and respect for us.

1226
01:03:36,802 --> 01:03:39,066
You may not like the pickle
I prepared

1227
01:03:39,146 --> 01:03:40,440
but she took it in a bottle

1228
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,850
and enjoying in her bedroom.

1229
01:03:42,143 --> 01:03:44,098
Oh, gosh!
She must be having it with drinks.

1230
01:03:44,270 --> 01:03:46,225
She keeps cheering everybody.

1231
01:03:46,305 --> 01:03:49,425
Always saying cheers on phone.

1232
01:03:50,109 --> 01:03:52,340
That's not cheering, father
but boozing.

1233
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:54,667
Ullas, get her down for lunch.

1234
01:03:54,857 --> 01:03:56,137
Alright, mother.

1235
01:04:08,030 --> 01:04:10,158
Hey, honey, come.

1236
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:11,732
What are you doing?

1237
01:04:12,138 --> 01:04:15,702
Vodka with pickle,
great combination.

1238
01:04:16,151 --> 01:04:17,215
That's poison.

1239
01:04:17,295 --> 01:04:18,278
No, no.

1240
01:04:18,503 --> 01:04:20,865
This is your brother's idea.

1241
01:04:20,945 --> 01:04:23,053
He stored vodka in this bottle.

1242
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,333
How do you know that?

1243
01:04:25,128 --> 01:04:26,391
I smelled it.

1244
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:28,726
Enough of it, everybody is waiting
for you at lunch.

1245
01:04:28,806 --> 01:04:30,715
No, I want one more.

1246
01:04:30,897 --> 01:04:32,627
I beg you, have no more.

1247
01:04:32,707 --> 01:04:33,690
Come on.
- No, Ullas.

1248
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:36,086
No more.
- One more.

1249
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:38,376
I want one more.

1250
01:04:38,456 --> 01:04:40,513
No more.
- I want one more.

1251
01:04:40,593 --> 01:04:41,559
No, no more.

1252
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:43,324
One more, please.

1253
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:51,533
What are you looking for?

1254
01:04:51,698 --> 01:04:54,016
I kept a digestive syrup here.

1255
01:04:54,096 --> 01:04:56,914
Laya asked
so I gave it.

1256
01:04:56,994 --> 01:04:58,049
Laya took the bottle?

1257
01:05:00,173 --> 01:05:03,508
Would anybody drink
till your puke.

1258
01:05:04,194 --> 01:05:05,017
Brother.

1259
01:05:05,097 --> 01:05:06,422
My brother's calling.

1260
01:05:07,895 --> 01:05:09,638
Why drink and puke?

1261
01:05:10,336 --> 01:05:11,464
Did he notice?

1262
01:05:16,646 --> 01:05:19,282
Did he hide my bottle?

1263
01:05:20,819 --> 01:05:22,625
Did you see my..
- Stop there.

1264
01:05:26,112 --> 01:05:28,534
Did you have my digestive
syrup?

1265
01:05:28,614 --> 01:05:31,087
Your syrup caused me
so many problems.

1266
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:33,350
You pretend calm like Gandhi
and guzzle brandy?

1267
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:37,225
What's wrong?

1268
01:05:37,305 --> 01:05:41,553
I've been puking since morning.

1269
01:05:41,633 --> 01:05:43,947
Don't cough up this
in front of father.

1270
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:45,785
I earnestly request you.

1271
01:05:45,865 --> 01:05:47,813
Don't come closer,
I'll cough out on you.

1272
01:05:49,009 --> 01:05:50,642
Give me if anything's left.

1273
01:05:56,329 --> 01:05:58,398
Where are these two?

1274
01:05:58,682 --> 01:06:00,640
Let's begin, they'll join us.
- You serve it.

1275
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:03,705
How can we have alone
without the newlyweds?

1276
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:05,303
I'll go, get them.

1277
01:06:07,794 --> 01:06:10,237
If my family knew we'll be nowhere.
- Ullas!

1278
01:06:14,644 --> 01:06:19,439
I heard that when husbands bathe
wives, they'll have good life.

1279
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,645
I have to change her dress.
Bye.

1280
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:24,835
Carry on.

1281
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,232
I want one more.

1282
01:06:32,736 --> 01:06:33,781
What's wrong?

1283
01:06:37,179 --> 01:06:39,323
She fell sick,
taking rest.

1284
01:06:39,403 --> 01:06:40,666
New to the weather

1285
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:42,292
she might have problem
adjusting.

1286
01:06:42,372 --> 01:06:43,918
Did you say anything
to your sister-in-law?

1287
01:06:43,998 --> 01:06:44,727
Nothing at all.

1288
01:06:44,807 --> 01:06:46,471
Then why she put
that long face?

1289
01:06:46,629 --> 01:06:48,504
Is it?
- What is this new habit?

1290
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:51,389
You had bath,
why should I give again?

1291
01:06:51,659 --> 01:06:52,856
You see

1292
01:06:53,168 --> 01:06:56,198
hardly three days into marriage
your brother's doing all this

1293
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:58,869
we've been married for three years,
what did you do?

1294
01:06:58,949 --> 01:07:01,317
I do whatever you say,
cause I love you

1295
01:07:01,663 --> 01:07:03,918
Do you really love me?

1296
01:07:03,998 --> 01:07:05,323
Yes, I do.

1297
01:07:05,891 --> 01:07:07,870
Would you cry if I'm dead?

1298
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:09,053
Hysterically.

1299
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:10,353
Show me how'd you cry.

1300
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:12,263
Show me how'd you be dead.

1301
01:07:27,747 --> 01:07:29,899
Alcohol is injurious to health

1302
01:07:30,037 --> 01:07:33,060
Alcoholic wife is injurious
to married life.

1303
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,202
Devdas drank when Parvathi
left him.

1304
01:07:36,493 --> 01:07:38,935
Now your wife is drinking,
what should you be doing?

1305
01:07:41,427 --> 01:07:43,537
Oh, my!
The chatter box is here.

1306
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:48,148
I'd been looking around
for you.

1307
01:07:48,362 --> 01:07:49,144
What for?

1308
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:51,988
Now I know why you
drank that day.

1309
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:54,984
One is obviously nervous
about wedding night.

1310
01:07:56,216 --> 01:07:58,617
I sent a bottle for you
with Laya.

1311
01:07:58,697 --> 01:08:00,236
Now Laya's gone missing.

1312
01:08:01,405 --> 01:08:02,892
You gave her full bottle?

1313
01:08:30,629 --> 01:08:31,715
Laya!

1314
01:08:33,701 --> 01:08:37,195
Hey, Ullas!
Come, join the party.

1315
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:39,664
My dear nephew

1316
01:08:39,851 --> 01:08:45,227
finally she's the one to take my
revenge on your father.

1317
01:08:45,307 --> 01:08:46,653
Superb!
- Hey, Ullas.

1318
01:08:46,834 --> 01:08:48,529
Learnt that you're married,
he's coming here.

1319
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:49,761
Who?
- Patel.

1320
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:52,681
It must be him calling.

1321
01:08:52,881 --> 01:08:55,372
We have a veneration service
at home, where are you?

1322
01:08:55,452 --> 01:08:57,531
Your father is asking for you both.

1323
01:08:57,814 --> 01:08:58,714
What happened?

1324
01:08:59,129 --> 01:09:00,403
There is a veneration service
at home

1325
01:09:00,483 --> 01:09:01,503
mother's calling me.
- Oh, no.

1326
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:02,782
If you take her along

1327
01:09:02,862 --> 01:09:05,688
you'll be in trouble
if she blabbers nonsense.

1328
01:09:05,903 --> 01:09:07,542
Your father will get heart stroke.

1329
01:09:07,957 --> 01:09:10,483
Mother, Laya's father
suffered cardiac arrest.

1330
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,911
We're flying to America
immediately.

1331
01:09:13,284 --> 01:09:14,820
What is this all of a sudden?

1332
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,308
Cardiac arrest happens without
prior intimation.

1333
01:09:16,388 --> 01:09:18,570
I'm sending Bose,
send our luggage with him.

1334
01:09:19,103 --> 01:09:20,660
Take care, you two.

1335
01:09:20,805 --> 01:09:24,340
Hey, honey, come.
Enjoy the party.

1336
01:09:24,762 --> 01:09:26,181
Cheers.
- Stop it.

1337
01:09:26,261 --> 01:09:28,416
Everybody's in veneration
back home, and you're drinking.

1338
01:09:28,496 --> 01:09:30,076
Relatives would've insulted us
if participated in this condition.

1339
01:09:30,395 --> 01:09:31,868
Relatives?
- Yes.

1340
01:09:31,948 --> 01:09:37,487
Then let's take two full bottles,
they would also join us.

1341
01:09:37,701 --> 01:09:40,275
Ask mother-in-law to prepare
omelets.

1342
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:42,295
Ask her to make them spicy enough.

1343
01:09:42,856 --> 01:09:45,312
What's the point in getting
irritated now. Get her omelet's.

1344
01:09:45,506 --> 01:09:46,523
I will.

1345
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:49,733
Will show her hell.
- Go ahead.

1346
01:09:49,813 --> 01:09:50,787
On reaching America

1347
01:09:50,867 --> 01:09:52,530
I'll get her assets transferred
onto my name

1348
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,218
then I'll make her follow me
like a dog.

1349
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:55,256
Then she'd learn good lesson.

1350
01:09:55,336 --> 01:09:57,470
Hope you won't forget me
in that hurry.

1351
01:09:57,550 --> 01:10:00,010
Sage Valmiki may forget
epic Ramayana

1352
01:10:00,090 --> 01:10:01,234
my uncle might forget alcohol

1353
01:10:01,314 --> 01:10:03,664
but I will forget you?
- Ullas, my friend.

1354
01:10:06,830 --> 01:10:08,761
Where is your son?
- Hey.

1355
01:10:08,916 --> 01:10:10,255
Alright, you ask him.

1356
01:10:10,997 --> 01:10:13,017
I'm asking you,
where's your son?

1357
01:10:13,144 --> 01:10:15,995
Why is he practicing tennis?
For tournament?

1358
01:10:16,199 --> 01:10:17,495
Do you need to know?

1359
01:10:17,949 --> 01:10:19,720
If he drops the ball

1360
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:21,585
boss will shoot him.

1361
01:10:21,762 --> 01:10:24,485
He's punished for not paying
interest

1362
01:10:24,619 --> 01:10:26,274
you people cheated our boss

1363
01:10:26,429 --> 01:10:28,377
just imagine your situation.

1364
01:10:28,632 --> 01:10:30,890
Sir, we're scared.

1365
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,154
We got him married with your
consent, didn't we?

1366
01:10:33,476 --> 01:10:34,918
Did you meant saying

1367
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:39,138
we got him married only
when you gave money, idiot?

1368
01:10:40,322 --> 01:10:43,275
Hey, tell me, where is Ullas?

1369
01:10:43,355 --> 01:10:44,548
He went to America.

1370
01:10:44,628 --> 01:10:46,341
Just tell me where is he.
- Don't kill me.

1371
01:10:46,421 --> 01:10:47,949
Let him go, please,
I beg your mercy.

1372
01:10:50,849 --> 01:10:54,718
Let alone America, I will get him
back even from the space.

1373
01:10:54,862 --> 01:10:55,515
You don't have a passport.

1374
01:10:55,670 --> 01:10:56,904
Then apply for one.

1375
01:10:56,984 --> 01:10:59,036
No chance, you're charged
with fake dollar related offence.

1376
01:11:00,088 --> 01:11:03,813
He can't fly away from me.

1377
01:11:08,816 --> 01:11:10,842
It's her fourth peg already.

1378
01:11:11,423 --> 01:11:12,220
Excuse me.
- Yes?

1379
01:11:12,347 --> 01:11:13,587
Can I get one more?
- Okay, ma'am.

1380
01:11:13,775 --> 01:11:14,976
No, no.

1381
01:11:15,252 --> 01:11:16,442
No, you may go.

1382
01:11:16,608 --> 01:11:19,005
Ullas, do not go overboard.

1383
01:11:19,187 --> 01:11:20,986
We've boarded the flight
quite awhile ago.

1384
01:11:21,252 --> 01:11:23,770
Hello, you may leave.

1385
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:26,147
I am my boss,
no, I am her boss.

1386
01:11:26,747 --> 01:11:28,058
Hey, please wait.

1387
01:11:28,208 --> 01:11:30,731
Okay, ma'am. - Do not interfere
in my personal affairs, Ullas.

1388
01:11:30,897 --> 01:11:32,823
We're not in any affair,
but into marriage.

1389
01:11:33,017 --> 01:11:34,362
You, country brute!

1390
01:11:34,506 --> 01:11:35,314
What does it mean?

1391
01:11:35,394 --> 01:11:37,063
It means, a sadistic fool
from village.

1392
01:11:37,143 --> 01:11:38,364
Oh, my!

1393
01:11:38,635 --> 01:11:40,506
You just drank in broad daylight

1394
01:11:40,623 --> 01:11:43,035
and now swear at me,
your husband?

1395
01:11:45,084 --> 01:11:46,134
You slapped me?

1396
01:11:47,467 --> 01:11:49,172
What's happening?

1397
01:11:49,340 --> 01:11:50,836
He's beating his wife.

1398
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:52,342
Who is the bugger?

1399
01:11:52,471 --> 01:11:56,088
Hey, man, you should respect
your woman.

1400
01:11:56,291 --> 01:11:59,767
What's wrong in women
boozing?

1401
01:12:01,538 --> 01:12:03,207
All the remaining ladies

1402
01:12:03,535 --> 01:12:05,696
you may take whatever brand
you prefer.

1403
01:12:06,037 --> 01:12:10,298
Do women have no freedom
in sky as well?

1404
01:12:10,445 --> 01:12:13,106
What is going on here?
This is democratic country.

1405
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:17,481
I'm talking to you,
look at me.

1406
01:12:20,953 --> 01:12:22,843
Oh, how come you here?

1407
01:12:23,251 --> 01:12:26,289
It's me, Boggu Babji.
How are you?

1408
01:12:27,745 --> 01:12:29,463
No, oh, no.

1409
01:12:29,543 --> 01:12:31,664
What are you doing?
- Watch it.

1410
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:33,763
No, no.

1411
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:36,048
Ullas, what nonsense?

1412
01:12:36,429 --> 01:12:37,119
Shut up!

1413
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,596
Hello, taxi?

1414
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,299
Keep the box in.

1415
01:13:02,781 --> 01:13:05,363
Keep that one, too.

1416
01:13:06,846 --> 01:13:08,453
Don't forget you're a woman.

1417
01:13:09,941 --> 01:13:12,606
Who will keep this,
your father?

1418
01:13:12,783 --> 01:13:14,045
Yeah, my father.

1419
01:13:14,232 --> 01:13:16,344
Find him and ask to keep.

1420
01:13:16,526 --> 01:13:20,165
You're crossing limits.
Will teach you lesson.

1421
01:13:21,720 --> 01:13:23,190
Hey..

1422
01:13:23,562 --> 01:13:25,262
Don't mess with me.

1423
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:28,091
Don't leave me.
I'm new to America.

1424
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:31,518
Hey, you!

1425
01:13:36,425 --> 01:13:40,091
Had you not found me, you'd be
begging on streets of America.

1426
01:13:42,035 --> 01:13:42,659
Yeah, tell me.

1427
01:13:43,327 --> 01:13:44,678
What was the name of that girl?

1428
01:13:44,904 --> 01:13:46,064
What's the name of your wife?

1429
01:13:46,271 --> 01:13:47,321
Laya.

1430
01:13:47,626 --> 01:13:49,668
It's Laya.
- And her father's name?

1431
01:13:50,022 --> 01:13:51,049
Sridhar Srikakulam.

1432
01:13:51,227 --> 01:13:54,060
It's some Sridhar Srikakulam.

1433
01:13:54,459 --> 01:13:55,464
Found it, dude.

1434
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,235
So many cars are parked,
must be some party.

1435
01:14:08,407 --> 01:14:11,520
So you persuaded a wealthy girl.
- I persuaded the girl for wealth.

1436
01:14:11,754 --> 01:14:14,379
Sir, pay a hundred dollars extra.

1437
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:15,801
Okay, I'll call you later.

1438
01:14:17,408 --> 01:14:18,661
You're finally here,
son-in-law.

1439
01:14:19,050 --> 01:14:20,631
Wow!

1440
01:14:20,861 --> 01:14:23,584
You guessed I wouldn't?
Are you disappointed?

1441
01:14:23,664 --> 01:14:26,542
Nobody has eaten since morning
awaiting you.

1442
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:29,703
Brother, done with biryani.
Where is the dessert?

1443
01:14:29,783 --> 01:14:31,656
Go and check.
- Wow!

1444
01:14:31,838 --> 01:14:32,666
Get my luggage.

1445
01:14:32,989 --> 01:14:33,755
Get the luggage.

1446
01:14:33,884 --> 01:14:34,793
Open the dickey.

1447
01:14:35,133 --> 01:14:36,108
Who, me?
- Yes.

1448
01:14:40,376 --> 01:14:41,342
Dollars, please.

1449
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,670
I've no change,
come later.

1450
01:14:43,162 --> 01:14:44,119
I'm not a beggar.

1451
01:14:44,539 --> 01:14:45,620
I am the owner of the car
and driver as well.

1452
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,321
Have lunch and take the money.

1453
01:15:18,364 --> 01:15:21,030
Startled?
Do you get me now?

1454
01:15:21,177 --> 01:15:24,467
Don't cross your limits.
I left you at the airport.

1455
01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:26,356
Next time I'll leave you
in the zoo.

1456
01:15:26,507 --> 01:15:29,572
Leave me wherever you can

1457
01:15:29,652 --> 01:15:33,800
I'll be back to fight.

1458
01:15:34,704 --> 01:15:36,408
Can't you watch your step?
- Sorry. - Get los!

1459
01:15:36,882 --> 01:15:39,207
If you misbehave with my daddy..
- What would you do?

1460
01:15:39,538 --> 01:15:40,654
Hey.
- You!

1461
01:15:41,371 --> 01:15:46,662
You drink vodka, whiskey, wine
or whatever

1462
01:15:46,932 --> 01:15:49,256
I'll get you settled with coffee.

1463
01:15:49,726 --> 01:15:51,028
Your countdown begins.

1464
01:15:52,874 --> 01:15:56,367
I'll shake your life
until ask for a break.

1465
01:15:56,545 --> 01:15:58,471
You?
- You!

1466
01:15:58,600 --> 01:16:00,570
You!
- You!

1467
01:16:05,914 --> 01:16:07,641
Hi, beautiful girls!

1468
01:16:07,973 --> 01:16:09,785
Life is beautiful.

1469
01:16:10,249 --> 01:16:11,463
Any juicy gossip?

1470
01:16:11,893 --> 01:16:12,473
Nothing.

1471
01:16:14,143 --> 01:16:18,295
Four girls gather and no gossip,
must be something wrong.

1472
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:20,792
Where's Mrs. Murthy?

1473
01:16:22,263 --> 01:16:23,272
You mean, my wife?

1474
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:25,694
What girls?

1475
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:28,608
Does anybody get beer
to the bar itself?

1476
01:16:28,776 --> 01:16:31,389
Does anybody get wife along
to such parties?

1477
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:35,223
Anyway, she's off to part
another couple.

1478
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,411
You know she's a lawyer, right?

1479
01:16:37,575 --> 01:16:39,041
Quite dangerous lady.

1480
01:16:46,454 --> 01:16:47,353
Hi, Jhansi.

1481
01:16:49,331 --> 01:16:52,776
Just now I was saying that your
presence give pleasures

1482
01:16:53,286 --> 01:16:56,000
and the party gets lively.
And you're here.

1483
01:16:56,421 --> 01:16:58,502
You come home,
my mind goes haywire.

1484
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:00,766
You will sleep in the corridor
tonight.

1485
01:17:01,036 --> 01:17:03,277
Mind it if you stepped
in the bedroom.

1486
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:05,645
Girls, you have fun.
I'll catch you later.

1487
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:10,272
Laya, we're getting to party.
The guests have arrived.

1488
01:17:10,458 --> 01:17:11,915
Please, don't insult us.
- Mom.

1489
01:17:12,234 --> 01:17:15,426
Hello, don't orbit me.

1490
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:16,453
Please, Laya.
- What?

1491
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:19,239
Don't revolve around me,
I'll faint.

1492
01:17:19,415 --> 01:17:22,444
Ullas, try to understand, please.
- Sorry.

1493
01:17:23,223 --> 01:17:26,938
You should have apologized
to me then itself.

1494
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:32,270
Hello, Mrs. Ullas, you left your
husband on road.

1495
01:17:32,549 --> 01:17:33,696
You know how I was scared?

1496
01:17:33,948 --> 01:17:35,702
Why fear? You should have
called me.

1497
01:17:35,782 --> 01:17:36,641
Did you give me your
phone number?

1498
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:39,763
Please, get ready for my sake.

1499
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:44,107
Okay.

1500
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:46,493
Thank you, Ullas.

1501
01:17:46,612 --> 01:17:48,140
You made my day.
- Yes.

1502
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,973
He doesn't get good English.

1503
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:56,121
You, country pumpkin!

1504
01:17:56,373 --> 01:17:58,260
I'm not pumpkin,
you are a dustbin.

1505
01:17:58,485 --> 01:18:00,965
My parents might excuse you

1506
01:18:01,387 --> 01:18:02,790
but my friend won't.

1507
01:18:02,915 --> 01:18:03,814
Who is that?

1508
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:15,455
Hi, Laya!

1509
01:18:16,075 --> 01:18:17,585
Hey, Ryan!

1510
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:20,149
Come on!
- Oh, good to see you.

1511
01:18:21,128 --> 01:18:23,134
You look so stunning.
- Thank you.

1512
01:18:23,214 --> 01:18:24,387
Where's your husband?

1513
01:18:24,737 --> 01:18:25,963
The boy's there.

1514
01:18:26,207 --> 01:18:27,389
Go and meet him.
- Alright.

1515
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:32,472
Hi!

1516
01:18:32,867 --> 01:18:36,184
How're you doing?
I am Ryan, Laya's close friend.

1517
01:18:36,264 --> 01:18:37,704
Close friend?

1518
01:18:37,864 --> 01:18:39,625
She's a very sexy girl.

1519
01:18:39,705 --> 01:18:42,562
Sexy girl?
- We were classmates for two years.

1520
01:18:42,770 --> 01:18:44,126
Two years?

1521
01:18:44,272 --> 01:18:46,154
We shared a room together.

1522
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:47,475
You were roommates, too?

1523
01:18:47,555 --> 01:18:49,738
Yeah. We shared everything.

1524
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,058
You shared everything?

1525
01:18:57,049 --> 01:18:57,796
That's too much.

1526
01:18:58,613 --> 01:19:00,066
Ryan!

1527
01:19:00,453 --> 01:19:01,685
Coming, ma'am.

1528
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:04,902
Bye!

1529
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:08,036
Oh, my God!

1530
01:19:09,586 --> 01:19:11,980
That you were roommates
with that white guy?

1531
01:19:12,534 --> 01:19:14,243
Yeah, for two years.

1532
01:19:15,101 --> 01:19:17,924
You spent two years together
in a room

1533
01:19:18,257 --> 01:19:19,862
with a guy?

1534
01:19:20,173 --> 01:19:21,004
How shameless.

1535
01:19:21,225 --> 01:19:21,945
So, what?

1536
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,923
Would a kid keep away from candy?

1537
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,870
Would a terrorist keep away
from gun?

1538
01:19:29,056 --> 01:19:31,098
Hello, what do you mean.

1539
01:19:31,485 --> 01:19:33,907
I mean..

1540
01:19:36,348 --> 01:19:39,330
All girls are his sisters.
- Sisters?

1541
01:19:39,593 --> 01:19:40,762
Yeah.
- But, how?

1542
01:19:41,157 --> 01:19:43,530
Because, he's gay.

1543
01:19:44,063 --> 01:19:46,858
A gay?
You mean, homosexual?

1544
01:19:47,287 --> 01:19:47,834
Yeah.

1545
01:19:49,404 --> 01:19:50,985
So that was why

1546
01:19:51,141 --> 01:19:56,497
he was fondling me
while talking about you.

1547
01:20:04,289 --> 01:20:07,126
So now that you know

1548
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:09,188
don't play with him.

1549
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,561
Okay.

1550
01:20:15,298 --> 01:20:19,089
It's so difficult wearing
the tie.

1551
01:20:20,855 --> 01:20:22,045
You don't know how to wear a tie

1552
01:20:22,377 --> 01:20:23,860
but you still want it?

1553
01:20:24,182 --> 01:20:25,577
How could be this owl face?

1554
01:20:26,175 --> 01:20:27,581
You slapped Laya on flight?

1555
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:29,374
You cultureless brute.

1556
01:20:29,717 --> 01:20:30,597
I'm not a fruit

1557
01:20:30,902 --> 01:20:32,302
I'm a thirty year old
from Venkatapuram.

1558
01:20:32,382 --> 01:20:33,663
Yeah, thirty years

1559
01:20:33,879 --> 01:20:36,359
but have no common sense,
no manners

1560
01:20:36,575 --> 01:20:39,702
aren't you ashamed of assaulting
life partner?

1561
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:43,905
He must be another idiot.

1562
01:20:44,076 --> 01:20:45,792
Another idiot?
Who is he?

1563
01:20:47,724 --> 01:20:48,293
I got you.
Don't weep.

1564
01:20:50,496 --> 01:20:51,233
Oh, my God.

1565
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:52,481
Is Laya ready?
- What's the delay?

1566
01:20:52,561 --> 01:20:54,028
Excuse me, my dear ideal couple.

1567
01:20:54,401 --> 01:20:57,180
You said Laya will be happy
marrying that village guy.

1568
01:20:57,573 --> 01:20:59,477
And that they are made
for each other.

1569
01:20:59,915 --> 01:21:01,586
But they are bad for each other.

1570
01:21:02,704 --> 01:21:04,188
What's so special about him?

1571
01:21:04,664 --> 01:21:05,301
Good looks?

1572
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:07,283
Oh!

1573
01:21:07,869 --> 01:21:09,347
He's a mirror cracking
material.

1574
01:21:10,482 --> 01:21:12,081
We thought you'd get a fine man
for her

1575
01:21:12,303 --> 01:21:13,582
but you got her a dark man.

1576
01:21:14,090 --> 01:21:16,576
He isn't worth a dollar.

1577
01:21:17,052 --> 01:21:18,508
He is right.

1578
01:21:18,856 --> 01:21:21,042
Hello, aren't you coming?

1579
01:21:21,336 --> 01:21:22,548
Guests will be leaving soon.

1580
01:21:22,692 --> 01:21:26,013
Not an issue, he isn't a Picasso
painting that we show them.

1581
01:21:26,379 --> 01:21:27,967
He looks like a painter.

1582
01:21:28,295 --> 01:21:29,850
Son of a witch!

1583
01:21:29,999 --> 01:21:30,924
Just kill him.

1584
01:21:31,068 --> 01:21:31,554
Come with me.

1585
01:21:31,704 --> 01:21:32,891
What for?
- What if he slaps me?

1586
01:21:33,011 --> 01:21:33,679
Don't fret.
Go ahead.

1587
01:21:33,817 --> 01:21:36,637
Hey, a gentleman is
absent over here

1588
01:21:36,780 --> 01:21:39,516
how dare you talk bad
about his body?

1589
01:21:39,658 --> 01:21:41,252
What are you talking?

1590
01:21:41,425 --> 01:21:44,618
You don't follow English,
do you need that blazer?

1591
01:21:47,031 --> 01:21:48,540
I said, when someone is not present

1592
01:21:48,673 --> 01:21:51,946
it's wrong biting his back.
Who are you, by the way?

1593
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:53,066
He is..

1594
01:21:53,225 --> 01:21:55,107
Aunt, hold on.
I'll deal him.

1595
01:21:55,235 --> 01:21:56,939
Look at his cheap hairstyle.

1596
01:21:57,065 --> 01:21:58,252
Hey, cultureless brute.

1597
01:21:58,385 --> 01:21:59,944
Oh, wow!

1598
01:22:00,068 --> 01:22:02,631
If I'm a brute,
then you are a rotten fruit.

1599
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:05,549
You!
- W, X, Y, Z.

1600
01:22:05,793 --> 01:22:06,780
I'll shave your head.

1601
01:22:06,972 --> 01:22:08,871
Hell with your hairstyle.

1602
01:22:10,398 --> 01:22:11,319
Let me get a trimmer for you.

1603
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:15,629
Why don't you take him
to a psychiatrist.

1604
01:22:15,745 --> 01:22:18,459
Anybody's got idea about tie?

1605
01:22:18,623 --> 01:22:22,351
All is well, dude. You seem to be
the right one for Raghuvaran.

1606
01:22:22,488 --> 01:22:23,935
Who is that man
so irritating?

1607
01:22:24,073 --> 01:22:25,800
You don't know him?

1608
01:22:26,083 --> 01:22:27,132
He's Laya's biological father.

1609
01:22:28,918 --> 01:22:30,440
Laya's mother has two husbands?

1610
01:22:31,352 --> 01:22:32,862
Don't you really know?

1611
01:22:33,022 --> 01:22:37,012
Ever since the marriage,
everything looks suspense to me.

1612
01:22:37,295 --> 01:22:39,145
You needn't fret about me.

1613
01:22:39,442 --> 01:22:41,067
I'm R. Murthy Sanchula.

1614
01:22:41,226 --> 01:22:42,336
You can call me Sanchi.

1615
01:22:42,465 --> 01:22:44,807
What do you do Mr. Sanchi?

1616
01:22:45,184 --> 01:22:47,066
I'm the Telugu Associate President.

1617
01:22:47,464 --> 01:22:49,320
Then why is your Telugu different?

1618
01:22:50,033 --> 01:22:51,525
This is pure American Telugu.

1619
01:22:51,795 --> 01:22:54,341
Wear the blazer and get ready.
We're getting late to party.

1620
01:22:56,386 --> 01:22:58,038
Bro, it's me.

1621
01:22:58,839 --> 01:23:01,354
Who is that fellow
ill treating you?

1622
01:23:01,434 --> 01:23:03,120
That's what I am not getting.
- That's why I tell you

1623
01:23:03,288 --> 01:23:05,967
never give someone
a chance to play you.

1624
01:23:06,207 --> 01:23:07,712
You must be strong enough.

1625
01:23:08,448 --> 01:23:12,132
Today I will teach that man
a lesson

1626
01:23:12,327 --> 01:23:14,264
otherwise my name isn't Ullas.

1627
01:23:14,388 --> 01:23:16,219
You wore the blazer wrong.

1628
01:23:18,483 --> 01:23:22,817
Welcome to the American Telugu
people.

1629
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:26,046
You have no manners.
- Oh, really!

1630
01:23:26,931 --> 01:23:33,624
Let's welcome the newly wedded
couple, Mr. and Mrs. Ullas.

1631
01:23:38,803 --> 01:23:40,089
Hi.
- Hello.

1632
01:23:42,381 --> 01:23:45,483
Your zip is open.
- Come again.

1633
01:23:46,672 --> 01:23:48,661
Your zip is open.

1634
01:23:58,171 --> 01:23:58,974
Hello.

1635
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,708
Families, please come forward.

1636
01:24:25,089 --> 01:24:27,289
The fathers and the mothers.

1637
01:24:28,519 --> 01:24:30,311
Miss, there's a small issue.

1638
01:24:30,505 --> 01:24:31,176
What happened?

1639
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:32,995
Your gown stuck
in my pants.

1640
01:24:35,030 --> 01:24:36,010
Do something.

1641
01:24:36,657 --> 01:24:37,282
You remove your gown.

1642
01:24:38,495 --> 01:24:39,287
Or shall I remove my pants?

1643
01:24:39,812 --> 01:24:41,201
Hold on.

1644
01:24:41,665 --> 01:24:43,918
Give them all a big hand.

1645
01:24:45,352 --> 01:24:48,878
And now, I welcome the father
of the bride.

1646
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:51,761
Where are you going?

1647
01:24:51,987 --> 01:24:54,716
He called the bride's father,
not the step-father. Step back.

1648
01:24:58,264 --> 01:25:01,303
My dear friends, they say
marriages are made in heaven.

1649
01:25:01,746 --> 01:25:05,061
That is why marriages made
on earth are turning into hell.

1650
01:25:05,141 --> 01:25:06,468
He's a negative fellow.

1651
01:25:06,817 --> 01:25:08,826
What?
- Continue.

1652
01:25:13,558 --> 01:25:16,890
Few ladies fall for men with looks
or money

1653
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,181
or even for height and fair
complexion

1654
01:25:19,458 --> 01:25:20,405
they give nod to marriage
with them.

1655
01:25:25,198 --> 01:25:28,359
So, my dear friends,
marriage is a big joke.

1656
01:25:30,755 --> 01:25:32,078
Cut it.
- Remove it fast.

1657
01:25:32,254 --> 01:25:34,485
Let's welcome my son-in-law.

1658
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:40,917
Let's welcome my son-in-law.

1659
01:25:45,162 --> 01:25:46,756
We're caught.
- Oh, God.

1660
01:25:47,382 --> 01:25:48,069
Where is he?

1661
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:49,419
What are you doing?
- He's right here.

1662
01:25:53,028 --> 01:25:56,421
Oh, he's Ullas
from Venkatapuram.

1663
01:25:56,797 --> 01:25:57,633
Yeah, I'm here.

1664
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,705
The only brilliant that I met
so far in life.

1665
01:26:00,866 --> 01:26:02,122
Hi.

1666
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:06,516
So, marriage..

1667
01:26:08,895 --> 01:26:12,122
One minute, please.

1668
01:26:12,532 --> 01:26:13,423
Yes.

1669
01:26:16,861 --> 01:26:19,318
Pull it strongly.

1670
01:26:19,618 --> 01:26:20,974
They're doing it so openly?

1671
01:26:21,677 --> 01:26:22,662
What you doing?
- Pull it out.

1672
01:26:23,857 --> 01:26:25,667
Indians these days have
gone open about everything.

1673
01:26:28,091 --> 01:26:29,126
She's cutting it.

1674
01:26:30,344 --> 01:26:31,551
Come on, faster.

1675
01:26:32,370 --> 01:26:33,145
Awe!

1676
01:26:34,025 --> 01:26:36,250
Am I watching porn live?

1677
01:26:42,776 --> 01:26:44,542
I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1678
01:26:49,451 --> 01:26:50,491
What are you doing here?

1679
01:26:50,812 --> 01:26:53,269
I liked that curtain.

1680
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:54,299
What is that?

1681
01:26:55,456 --> 01:26:57,133
What?
- The curtain stuck in my zipper.

1682
01:26:57,251 --> 01:26:58,118
Why the confusion?

1683
01:26:58,254 --> 01:26:59,998
The curtain fabric is simply
good.

1684
01:27:00,122 --> 01:27:02,145
I want to take home one.
- Go, purchase.

1685
01:27:02,443 --> 01:27:03,817
I'll get you one, too.

1686
01:27:06,098 --> 01:27:07,749
I must be smart enough.

1687
01:27:11,267 --> 01:27:13,382
So you'd catch him red handed,
you mean fishing?

1688
01:27:13,575 --> 01:27:16,581
I'll finish off his story
with my fishing. - Okay.

1689
01:27:16,714 --> 01:27:17,937
Follow me.

1690
01:27:25,906 --> 01:27:26,864
What are you filming?

1691
01:27:27,223 --> 01:27:28,137
You watch it, too.

1692
01:27:28,315 --> 01:27:29,732
Your father's complexion
is white

1693
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,920
but his nature is dark.
- Total black.

1694
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:34,691
Does he need girls in this age?

1695
01:27:34,851 --> 01:27:36,879
Hello, she's my step-mom.

1696
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,429
Your step mother?

1697
01:27:38,729 --> 01:27:40,399
It's common in America, dude.

1698
01:27:40,611 --> 01:27:43,795
Listen, her natal father
is with step mother

1699
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:46,962
and natal mother is with
step father, what is the confusion?

1700
01:27:47,154 --> 01:27:51,316
I just want to know how many
mothers and fathers you have.

1701
01:27:51,462 --> 01:27:52,192
You're mad.

1702
01:27:52,441 --> 01:27:54,482
She's bad.
- No, actually she's sad.

1703
01:27:55,035 --> 01:27:56,292
They have a love story.

1704
01:27:56,465 --> 01:27:57,523
Oh, wow, really!

1705
01:27:57,900 --> 01:27:59,078
Love is blind.
- Yeah.

1706
01:27:59,260 --> 01:28:00,039
Correct.

1707
01:28:00,216 --> 01:28:05,210
Laya's father divorced her mother
and married her seven years ago.

1708
01:28:05,791 --> 01:28:07,757
Thank you for the valuable
information.

1709
01:28:08,021 --> 01:28:08,898
Bye, Sanchulu.

1710
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,421
Come on, Jimmy,
- Yes.

1711
01:28:11,302 --> 01:28:12,790
Ram.
- Yes?

1712
01:28:12,941 --> 01:28:15,296
Laya got married in India

1713
01:28:15,798 --> 01:28:18,465
but she must be divorced
in America.

1714
01:28:18,642 --> 01:28:21,027
And I must take up that case.

1715
01:28:21,107 --> 01:28:23,026
They're just married

1716
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:24,837
and you want them divorced
immediately? - No.

1717
01:28:25,076 --> 01:28:26,865
My guess never goes amiss.

1718
01:28:27,405 --> 01:28:28,844
I can understand by their body
language

1719
01:28:29,087 --> 01:28:30,539
they haven't made love yet.

1720
01:28:55,395 --> 01:28:56,387
Look there.

1721
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:01,653
Look how they're quarreling.

1722
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:06,658
I didn't want to talk to you

1723
01:29:06,905 --> 01:29:09,562
but they are fighting
because of you.

1724
01:29:10,970 --> 01:29:12,510
I'm so happy.

1725
01:29:14,312 --> 01:29:16,172
Now, we are friends.

1726
01:29:34,669 --> 01:29:35,528
Cheers.

1727
01:29:43,279 --> 01:29:43,899
One more.

1728
01:29:44,727 --> 01:29:47,931
One more?
- Okay.

1729
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:11,958
Oh, my, the house is all thrash.

1730
01:30:12,917 --> 01:30:14,875
Laya..

1731
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,417
Laya, where are you?

1732
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:23,917
Laya..

1733
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:27,958
This looks like a stadium
after cricket match.

1734
01:30:35,000 --> 01:30:35,667
Hello.

1735
01:30:36,125 --> 01:30:37,000
Call you back.

1736
01:30:38,792 --> 01:30:39,958
Hell with her attitude.

1737
01:30:41,167 --> 01:30:42,583
Transfer my money to me.

1738
01:30:42,917 --> 01:30:47,167
We can't transfer funds
immediately. It'll take time.

1739
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:49,000
No, I want it immediately.

1740
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:51,708
Laya, I can never accept him
as your husband.

1741
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:53,750
That's right.

1742
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:57,125
She fooled parents with her
cooked up love story.

1743
01:30:57,625 --> 01:31:01,542
He is just your husband legally
not for life.

1744
01:31:02,292 --> 01:31:05,042
This is just one of your
dirty tricks.

1745
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:08,000
You shut your mouth.
I'm talking to my parents, here.

1746
01:31:08,167 --> 01:31:11,042
I'm also your parent,
your stepmom.

1747
01:31:11,417 --> 01:31:13,000
You are not my step mother

1748
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:15,000
but my father's bi..

1749
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:19,167
You, bloody.
- Are you mad?

1750
01:31:20,458 --> 01:31:22,083
You know what you're doing?
- Please, let me talk.

1751
01:31:22,167 --> 01:31:23,542
Who the hell do you think you are?
Please, don't argue.

1752
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:25,920
What a right time I arrived.
I will play with this idiot.

1753
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,958
What the hell you think you are?
- You don't have right to talk.

1754
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:31,708
Don't involve in my issues.
- Look here, ma'am.

1755
01:31:32,042 --> 01:31:33,625
You are so beautiful.

1756
01:31:33,833 --> 01:31:36,333
That awesome hairstyle
and your hazy eyes.

1757
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:39,042
And this beauty spot
makes you stand apart.

1758
01:31:39,208 --> 01:31:41,125
Hey, what are you doing?

1759
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43,083
I'm giving her the beauty tips.

1760
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,542
Ma'am, you should contest beauty
contest.

1761
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,667
Beauty, can we take a selfie?

1762
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:48,583
Yeah.

1763
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:52,042
Hey, won't you mind if just
anybody touches you?

1764
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:53,000
Can't you deny them?

1765
01:31:53,083 --> 01:31:55,792
Preach your daughter first,
then tell me.

1766
01:31:55,875 --> 01:31:57,333
You think you could talk to me
like that?

1767
01:31:57,417 --> 01:31:59,083
Laya..
- You call me whatever..

1768
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:00,792
Don't talk like that, baby.

1769
01:32:00,875 --> 01:32:02,333
You gave her the leniency.
- Quiet, shut up.

1770
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:03,750
It's all because of you.
- You, shut up.

1771
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:09,833
Hello.
- I'll be late to home.

1772
01:32:10,208 --> 01:32:11,542
I haven't eaten since morning.

1773
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:12,708
Check the fridge.

1774
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,750
Oh, my. Is this a fridge
or wine shop?

1775
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,167
'Clean the house!'

1776
01:32:26,042 --> 01:32:27,167
You think I'm a servant?

1777
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:29,750
You ask this MLA contestant
from Venkatapuram

1778
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:31,292
to clean your house?

1779
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:33,792
You just insulted the parliament.

1780
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:35,583
Mr. Sanchi!

1781
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:38,208
Some fool is knocking
when I'm so busy.

1782
01:32:38,958 --> 01:32:40,417
Mr. Sanchi.
- Hey, Ullas.

1783
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,333
You've come alone?

1784
01:32:42,625 --> 01:32:45,250
Those two couples
left me alone and went somewhere.

1785
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:47,792
Moreover, left this not saying
clean the house.

1786
01:32:50,708 --> 01:32:51,792
'Make sandwich.'

1787
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:53,250
'Wash clothes.'

1788
01:32:53,417 --> 01:32:54,750
'Clean toilet.'

1789
01:32:55,250 --> 01:32:57,042
You, too?
But why?

1790
01:32:57,792 --> 01:32:59,250
Ever heard of golden egg
laying duck?

1791
01:32:59,667 --> 01:33:01,125
I did but never saw one.

1792
01:33:01,833 --> 01:33:02,708
I'll show you.

1793
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:05,750
That's my lady, the golden egg
laying duck.

1794
01:33:06,417 --> 01:33:08,583
She lays an egg every day?
- One, every month.

1795
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:09,333
What must be worth?

1796
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:10,875
Fifteen lakh rupees per month.

1797
01:33:11,542 --> 01:33:13,083
You mean one crore eighty lakh
rupees a year?

1798
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:15,208
You are lucky, indeed.

1799
01:33:17,250 --> 01:33:18,250
Hey, dude.
- Yeah?

1800
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:19,917
You're a boxer as well?

1801
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,920
I was the champion before marriage,
she's the champion after marriage.

1802
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,917
You know, the lifestyle
has changed.

1803
01:33:25,042 --> 01:33:28,958
Women these days should work,
and men should cook, I mean enjoy.

1804
01:33:29,083 --> 01:33:31,833
My life is beautiful with my wife's
salary.

1805
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:33,667
Wow!

1806
01:33:33,917 --> 01:33:36,000
Hey, I have to prepare lunch,
my wife will be coming.

1807
01:33:36,625 --> 01:33:38,542
Even boxers cook, too?

1808
01:33:39,958 --> 01:33:40,917
Mr. Sanchi,

1809
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,583
You got a moneymaking wife
and I got guzzling girl.

1810
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,583
You know as little as beer
about Laya's money

1811
01:33:47,917 --> 01:33:49,958
yet to know as much as big bar.

1812
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:51,750
Could you elaborate?

1813
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:52,583
Okay.

1814
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:55,833
There's a big amount deposited
on Laya's name

1815
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:58,750
but she can't withdraw it.
You want some juice?

1816
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,958
Why juice while giving news?
Tell me the remaining part.

1817
01:34:01,083 --> 01:34:03,083
So, you're thirsty for news.
Okay.

1818
01:34:03,458 --> 01:34:07,958
Laya's grandpa moved to America
long back, earned well and died.

1819
01:34:08,083 --> 01:34:10,708
After his demise, Laya's parents
divorced

1820
01:34:10,917 --> 01:34:13,917
and set up new families
respectively.

1821
01:34:14,208 --> 01:34:17,083
Then, Laya claimed her share
in the court of law.

1822
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:20,792
Court granted hefty amount to her.

1823
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,208
Now, where's that money?

1824
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:25,750
Laya's parents proved that she's
alcoholic in court.

1825
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:28,250
Considering the grant release
to alcoholic involves risk to life

1826
01:34:28,375 --> 01:34:31,542
the court froze the money.

1827
01:34:32,375 --> 01:34:33,625
Why did you freeze now?

1828
01:34:34,167 --> 01:34:35,667
I'll give you the tip
to get the money.

1829
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:36,833
Please, tell me.

1830
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:40,292
If you get the citizenship,
as Laya's husband

1831
01:34:40,458 --> 01:34:44,458
you will bag rights over the money.
Your life will be beautiful.

1832
01:34:44,667 --> 01:34:46,417
How much would it be in cash?

1833
01:34:46,667 --> 01:34:48,583
Five hundred crores, approximately.

1834
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:01,625
'Cleaned the house.'

1835
01:35:03,458 --> 01:35:06,250
Dear one, you aren't a fridge
but a foreign exchange for me.

1836
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:11,542
Darling, treat me a cook
or servant, I won't mind

1837
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:15,083
because, all I need is the five
hundred crore rupees.

1838
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,417
So, until I grab that money

1839
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:20,042
I will not hesitate to do anything
you tell me.

1840
01:35:20,167 --> 01:35:21,708
One selfie, please.

1841
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:28,333
"Welcome, dear ones."

1842
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:29,750
Hi!
- Hello.

1843
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:31,375
Mommy, daddy

1844
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,000
why you standing outside,
come in, come in.

1845
01:35:38,125 --> 01:35:39,042
Wow!

1846
01:35:40,625 --> 01:35:43,833
I'm seeing the house so neat
and tidy for the first time.

1847
01:35:44,125 --> 01:35:45,042
Cleaning is my hobby, you know.

1848
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:47,625
We stay next door,
keep visiting.

1849
01:35:47,708 --> 01:35:48,250
For cleaning?

1850
01:35:49,042 --> 01:35:49,750
You, naughty.

1851
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:52,333
Revathi is a good cook.

1852
01:35:52,750 --> 01:35:54,917
That's why she prepared lunch
for you two.

1853
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,375
Oh, very nice.

1854
01:35:56,708 --> 01:36:00,417
Ullas, warm the food and have
whenever you wish to.

1855
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:01,708
Thank you so much.

1856
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:05,083
Now, both of you may turn and move.

1857
01:36:07,833 --> 01:36:08,958
No, no.

1858
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:12,667
I said, to turn around
and move. - Oh.

1859
01:36:15,208 --> 01:36:16,083
Where is Laya?

1860
01:36:16,333 --> 01:36:19,250
She went to her friends,
informed she'll be late.

1861
01:36:20,167 --> 01:36:23,458
Wonder if she went to friends
or to bar.

1862
01:36:23,792 --> 01:36:26,167
No issues, her happiness
is my joy.

1863
01:36:26,625 --> 01:36:27,458
Ullas

1864
01:36:29,625 --> 01:36:32,875
if Laya does anything wrong
by mistake

1865
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:34,625
just take it easy.

1866
01:36:35,333 --> 01:36:37,000
She is in my heart

1867
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:39,667
but her money is in the bank,
which I'm eagerly awaiting.

1868
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:40,542
Come again.

1869
01:36:40,875 --> 01:36:42,292
She is my heart.

1870
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:46,792
She's so lucky to have gotten
a good husband.

1871
01:36:49,708 --> 01:36:51,625
Keep this money,
just in case you need.

1872
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,542
Is it the dollars?
- Yes.

1873
01:36:56,250 --> 01:36:57,250
You take care.

1874
01:37:01,250 --> 01:37:02,333
Hi, Ullas!

1875
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:05,083
I'm diving deep in money here.

1876
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:06,750
Oh, that's great.

1877
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:09,167
Dollars, dude.

1878
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:12,333
Laya's five hundred crores money
will be mine.

1879
01:37:12,833 --> 01:37:15,833
Very good. I packed my luggage,
shall I leave tonight for America?

1880
01:37:16,042 --> 01:37:19,333
Why here? You start some business
on my name and run.

1881
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:22,000
You will be the boss for all
the lines of business there.

1882
01:37:22,917 --> 01:37:23,833
Me, the boss?

1883
01:37:24,917 --> 01:37:27,000
I must wash your feet
in gratitude. Sweety, get water.

1884
01:37:27,083 --> 01:37:28,708
You can thank me in person
when I come home.

1885
01:37:28,792 --> 01:37:31,000
I'll send you money,
start some business immediately.

1886
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:32,167
Thank you.

1887
01:37:32,375 --> 01:37:34,583
Is your wife home or in bar?

1888
01:37:36,042 --> 01:37:37,333
You reminded me well.

1889
01:37:37,417 --> 01:37:39,167
Now, I need to go to bar
and find her.

1890
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:54,125
Bro, I have to go out,
will you join?

1891
01:37:54,208 --> 01:37:56,000
If she wakes up,
I have to give her food.

1892
01:37:56,542 --> 01:37:59,625
She's had fifty omelets
and slept just now.

1893
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:03,542
It's difficult to push her aside
and come out.

1894
01:38:04,042 --> 01:38:06,167
Why don't you try a little
for my sake?

1895
01:38:06,792 --> 01:38:07,875
Oh, gosh!

1896
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:09,458
What happened, dude?

1897
01:38:09,583 --> 01:38:11,542
She hurt me there.

1898
01:38:12,458 --> 01:38:16,583
Why did you kick me there,
you fool?

1899
01:38:23,917 --> 01:38:25,625
Mr. Sanchi.
- Yes, Ullas.

1900
01:38:25,917 --> 01:38:27,042
What can I do for you?

1901
01:38:27,333 --> 01:38:28,583
Could you come out with me?

1902
01:38:28,875 --> 01:38:31,333
I 'm too busy right now,
no time to go bathroom too.

1903
01:38:31,833 --> 01:38:33,417
Oh, you haven't cleansed
the bathroom yet?

1904
01:38:33,792 --> 01:38:37,708
Oh, you understand that way?
I meant

1905
01:38:38,167 --> 01:38:39,833
I have no time to even go
bathroom.

1906
01:38:40,292 --> 01:38:41,667
Oh, no issues.

1907
01:38:41,917 --> 01:38:45,417
Just wanted to go to bar and have
a peg or two with you, if free.

1908
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:49,875
Okay, you didn't ask me
for anything.

1909
01:38:49,958 --> 01:38:51,375
I'll come for you.

1910
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:52,833
You just said busy.

1911
01:38:53,042 --> 01:38:54,333
You just said bar?

1912
01:39:06,125 --> 01:39:07,417
Yeah, let's settle here.

1913
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:11,000
Mr. Sanchi, I didn't like
this place.

1914
01:39:11,625 --> 01:39:13,917
Man, are we here to buy the place?

1915
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,833
We came, will guzzle and leave.

1916
01:39:17,250 --> 01:39:18,750
But still

1917
01:39:18,833 --> 01:39:20,833
I couldn't connect to the ambience
here.

1918
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:23,542
Man, you took me to four bars
until now

1919
01:39:23,875 --> 01:39:24,792
this is the fifth.

1920
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,542
Getting admission into Oxford
University is easy

1921
01:39:28,042 --> 01:39:30,208
than to get place in the bar.
Such heavy competition.

1922
01:39:30,542 --> 01:39:33,583
I don't want competition
but few memories

1923
01:39:33,667 --> 01:39:36,750
about coming to bar
with you.

1924
01:39:37,042 --> 01:39:38,750
In that case, there's another type
of bar next block

1925
01:39:38,833 --> 01:39:43,125
If you go there, you'll remember
drinks and forget the rest.

1926
01:39:43,708 --> 01:39:45,750
If we go there, you'll have one
and me two.

1927
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,083
Okay, done.

1928
01:39:54,375 --> 01:39:56,292
That's Laya.
- You have to pay the bill.

1929
01:39:56,458 --> 01:39:58,208
I'm not going to pay the bill.

1930
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:01,962
Oh, so you were looking
for this?

1931
01:40:02,042 --> 01:40:04,375
Alright then, keep in mind,
you have one, me two.

1932
01:40:04,458 --> 01:40:05,917
Done.
- Move.

1933
01:40:06,167 --> 01:40:08,792
You have to pay the bill.
- I have paid for the drinks

1934
01:40:08,875 --> 01:40:11,833
which you have given.
- You had four drinks here.

1935
01:40:11,917 --> 01:40:12,962
Do whatever you want.
- Oh, my God.

1936
01:40:13,042 --> 01:40:13,833
Call the manager.

1937
01:40:13,917 --> 01:40:14,920
Don't know..
- Just get out.

1938
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:17,583
I can't do anything.
- Hey, stop.

1939
01:40:17,667 --> 01:40:18,833
You, get out, idiot.

1940
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:20,458
You called me an idiot?

1941
01:40:20,958 --> 01:40:21,750
I'll deal you later.

1942
01:40:22,042 --> 01:40:23,375
Excuse me, who the hell are you?

1943
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:25,000
I'm her husband.

1944
01:40:25,083 --> 01:40:26,833
I'm supposed to protect my wife.

1945
01:40:27,125 --> 01:40:28,042
What?

1946
01:40:30,250 --> 01:40:31,920
I'm supposed to protect my wife.
- What?

1947
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,708
This is my girlfriend
not yours.

1948
01:40:33,792 --> 01:40:36,625
No, this finger is only for
fluency in English.

1949
01:40:36,792 --> 01:40:38,000
But this is for decency.

1950
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:42,958
Kill him, Mr. Sanchi.

1951
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:45,000
He'll beat you.

1952
01:40:45,417 --> 01:40:47,542
He's the best boxer in my country.

1953
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:52,292
He is Mike Tyson,
beat him!

1954
01:40:59,458 --> 01:41:00,458
Oh, my God!

1955
01:41:00,583 --> 01:41:02,542
Save me. Oh, my God!

1956
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:04,542
Someone help me!

1957
01:41:04,917 --> 01:41:06,292
Mercy, please.

1958
01:41:12,208 --> 01:41:13,583
You, rascal!

1959
01:41:24,083 --> 01:41:25,708
If we get to that bar

1960
01:41:26,125 --> 01:41:27,833
you'll have one,
me two.

1961
01:41:29,417 --> 01:41:30,667
We had it.
Account settled.

1962
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:35,958
Aren't you a boxer in real?

1963
01:41:36,667 --> 01:41:37,958
No.

1964
01:41:38,375 --> 01:41:40,333
I know only cooking.

1965
01:41:40,583 --> 01:41:42,917
Then, what's with that picture?

1966
01:41:43,750 --> 01:41:47,417
My wife got it clicked
for the fancy dress competition.

1967
01:41:48,833 --> 01:41:50,417
Life is not beautiful.

1968
01:41:50,833 --> 01:41:52,458
It's actually painful.

1969
01:41:52,833 --> 01:41:55,375
Shut your mouths,
you, bloody dogs!

1970
01:41:56,625 --> 01:41:58,375
She is horrible.

1971
01:42:02,542 --> 01:42:05,542
I want one more bottle.

1972
01:42:14,958 --> 01:42:17,875
Laya's parents are to be blamed
for her condition.

1973
01:42:19,042 --> 01:42:22,833
They got separated
and left her alone.

1974
01:42:27,292 --> 01:42:29,583
To get her imbibe foreign culture

1975
01:42:30,292 --> 01:42:32,833
her father introduced
drinks to her.

1976
01:42:34,333 --> 01:42:37,042
Only alcohol accompanied her
through her loneliness.

1977
01:42:37,625 --> 01:42:38,833
Now, she got into addiction.

1978
01:42:39,333 --> 01:42:41,375
She's severely addicted.

1979
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,917
Ullas, you know this
will only lead to

1980
01:42:47,250 --> 01:42:49,792
terminating disease called
liver cirrhosis.

1981
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:52,208
If this lifestyle is continued

1982
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,375
she won't live for long.

1983
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,208
How can you be happy with a girl
like her?

1984
01:43:03,917 --> 01:43:05,875
I'd been observing you both
from the start

1985
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:08,250
only fighting like cat and dog.

1986
01:43:09,083 --> 01:43:11,208
Instead of living together
with tiffs

1987
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,042
it's better to separate
and be happy.

1988
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:18,042
I mean, this is just my opinion.

1989
01:43:27,083 --> 01:43:30,000
I never got anything that I desired
for in life.

1990
01:43:30,083 --> 01:43:32,333
You're the first one that I got.

1991
01:43:33,625 --> 01:43:36,000
Men's love halts with marriage

1992
01:43:36,083 --> 01:43:38,542
but women's love begin there on.

1993
01:43:38,625 --> 01:43:41,042
But, I wish our love that begun
as kids

1994
01:43:41,125 --> 01:43:43,583
will remain until last.

1995
01:43:44,583 --> 01:43:47,792
I want to be happy with you
till my last breath.

1996
01:44:36,042 --> 01:44:37,920
Good morning,
cold coffee.

1997
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,708
Hey, morning.
You know how to make cold coffee?

1998
01:44:41,042 --> 01:44:42,292
Not a big deal

1999
01:44:42,542 --> 01:44:44,792
I made coffee and cooled it
under the fan.

2000
01:44:44,958 --> 01:44:46,208
And the cold coffee's ready.

2001
01:44:48,917 --> 01:44:50,625
Sorry, I don't want to start
a mess now.

2002
01:44:52,375 --> 01:44:53,625
You know what

2003
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,042
your parents came home for you
yesterday. They love you.

2004
01:44:58,542 --> 01:44:59,583
How do you know?

2005
01:45:00,833 --> 01:45:02,000
They gave this cover.

2006
01:45:02,875 --> 01:45:05,000
What is this?
- Liquid cash.

2007
01:45:11,750 --> 01:45:13,583
Laya, is the amount low?

2008
01:45:13,667 --> 01:45:15,875
They promised to give as much as
we need, but I let down.

2009
01:45:16,125 --> 01:45:18,125
Hi, first mom,
hi, step dad.

2010
01:45:20,458 --> 01:45:22,750
Don't donate and insult us.

2011
01:45:22,833 --> 01:45:26,375
You needn't worry about
our survival.

2012
01:45:26,458 --> 01:45:28,667
We believe in each other.

2013
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,958
We know how to take care
of ourselves.

2014
01:45:33,333 --> 01:45:34,167
Come, Ullas.

2015
01:45:36,667 --> 01:45:37,417
It's okay.

2016
01:45:38,125 --> 01:45:41,375
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Where are you off to?

2017
01:45:41,833 --> 01:45:42,875
To the bar.

2018
01:45:43,375 --> 01:45:45,750
Why always go to the bar?
- My mood is off.

2019
01:45:45,833 --> 01:45:46,375
Why so?

2020
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:47,708
Today is Kartik's birthday.

2021
01:45:47,875 --> 01:45:50,125
Who is he?
- My stepbrother.

2022
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:52,708
Your family is too fast
wrong steps.

2023
01:45:53,250 --> 01:45:56,000
I mean, you may skip
his birthday party.

2024
01:45:56,292 --> 01:45:57,792
He likes me so much.

2025
01:45:57,875 --> 01:45:59,667
He'll be disappointed
if I didn't go.

2026
01:46:00,042 --> 01:46:01,042
Then, we're going.

2027
01:46:09,417 --> 01:46:11,625
Hey, Ullas!

2028
01:46:11,708 --> 01:46:12,917
Hi, dude!

2029
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:14,333
Yeah.

2030
01:46:16,750 --> 01:46:18,962
So you were also invited
to the party?

2031
01:46:19,042 --> 01:46:19,708
No, dude.

2032
01:46:19,792 --> 01:46:21,167
Choc-bar is working in caterers.

2033
01:46:21,250 --> 01:46:23,375
What is that name?
- It's my wife's nickname.

2034
01:46:23,458 --> 01:46:24,750
So you love it?

2035
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,750
Smash it.
- Oh, damn it.

2036
01:46:26,833 --> 01:46:29,000
You know what,
I love her.

2037
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,792
I cannot see the world
when she's in front of me.


2038
01:46:32,583 --> 01:46:33,333
You love her so much?

2039
01:46:33,417 --> 01:46:35,083
No, she's that much fat.

2040
01:46:45,083 --> 01:46:46,208
How is she?

2041
01:46:46,542 --> 01:46:48,458
Too hefty for a wife.

2042
01:46:48,833 --> 01:46:52,333
Hi, Jimmy.
Hi. Oh, gosh!

2043
01:46:59,417 --> 01:47:00,962
Come on, darling.
- Sweety, leave me, please.

2044
01:47:01,042 --> 01:47:02,375
What's it, darling?
- Please, sweety.

2045
01:47:02,458 --> 01:47:03,667
Please, leave.

2046
01:47:05,708 --> 01:47:06,583
Ullas?
- Oh, sorry.

2047
01:47:06,708 --> 01:47:09,542
Excuse me,
relax a minute.

2048
01:47:13,667 --> 01:47:16,042
Thanks, dude. Her hairs
smell too bad.

2049
01:47:16,125 --> 01:47:17,125
Get her head shaved.

2050
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:19,333
Hey, Laya.

2051
01:47:19,417 --> 01:47:21,417
Hi, how are you?
- Good, how're you? - Good.

2052
01:47:21,542 --> 01:47:22,458
Come, let's go and party.

2053
01:47:22,583 --> 01:47:24,667
Yeah, let's go.
- I'll be right back.

2054
01:47:25,917 --> 01:47:27,962
There's so many cute girls
in America

2055
01:47:28,042 --> 01:47:29,750
why did you marry that plump?

2056
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,125
To be permanent resident,
we need to marry American origin.

2057
01:47:32,208 --> 01:47:33,625
Any issues, we can divorce

2058
01:47:33,792 --> 01:47:36,000
but she was pregnant
at the right time.

2059
01:47:37,333 --> 01:47:38,333
Are you the father of that kid?

2060
01:47:38,417 --> 01:47:39,625
She told so.

2061
01:47:40,042 --> 01:47:40,792
Hi, dad!

2062
01:47:40,875 --> 01:47:42,417
Hi, how's your boxing practice?

2063
01:47:42,583 --> 01:47:43,458
My practice?

2064
01:47:43,583 --> 01:47:44,792
Oh, no, no.

2065
01:47:45,208 --> 01:47:46,958
Hey, this is not sand bag.

2066
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:48,417
Please, go.

2067
01:47:49,667 --> 01:47:50,458
She's my daughter.

2068
01:47:50,583 --> 01:47:52,250
Oh.
- Sister Tyson.

2069
01:47:52,333 --> 01:47:53,917
Yours is a heavy family.

2070
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,583
Leave it, look there.

2071
01:47:58,375 --> 01:47:59,833
He's my son.

2072
01:47:59,917 --> 01:48:01,875
Really?
- She told me, so.

2073
01:48:02,458 --> 01:48:04,750
She's the mother,
but I'm not father.

2074
01:48:05,042 --> 01:48:06,917
But I named those kids.

2075
01:48:07,125 --> 01:48:09,583
Daughter's name
is Anasuya Ramalingam.

2076
01:48:09,875 --> 01:48:12,000
Son's name, Ananda Vihari.

2077
01:48:13,167 --> 01:48:14,875
Is it?
- Yeah.

2078
01:48:15,125 --> 01:48:18,333
Hey, Kartik.
- Oh, sister!

2079
01:48:20,042 --> 01:48:21,792
Happy birthday.

2080
01:48:22,292 --> 01:48:24,292
What a grand par..

2081
01:48:25,042 --> 01:48:27,542
And this is for you.

2082
01:48:38,708 --> 01:48:39,792
Why is she here?

2083
01:48:39,875 --> 01:48:41,833
What are you talking?
She is his sister.

2084
01:48:41,917 --> 01:48:43,375
But she's a party destroyer.

2085
01:48:43,458 --> 01:48:45,920
She'll get drunk and spoil
the party.

2086
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:46,583
Please.

2087
01:48:47,167 --> 01:48:48,458
If she's here, I'm leaving.

2088
01:48:54,125 --> 01:48:56,250
Hey, Tamanna, please.

2089
01:48:56,750 --> 01:48:57,417
Everybody is waiting there.

2090
01:48:57,542 --> 01:48:59,542
I won't come until she leaves.

2091
01:49:01,250 --> 01:49:03,292
Please, don't keep all waiting.

2092
01:49:03,625 --> 01:49:06,750
If she doesn't leave,
I will not join.

2093
01:49:09,292 --> 01:49:11,625
Happy birthday, Kartik.
- Thank you.

2094
01:49:13,667 --> 01:49:16,083
You look disturbed,
what's wrong?

2095
01:49:16,250 --> 01:49:19,000
He's coming to ask me leave.

2096
01:49:19,542 --> 01:49:20,833
Oh, I see.

2097
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,750
I will manage him.

2098
01:49:31,833 --> 01:49:33,875
Bye, first dad.
- Shame.

2099
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:36,167
Laya, please.

2100
01:49:36,417 --> 01:49:38,042
I can't convince her.

2101
01:49:45,625 --> 01:49:47,000
Please, she won't disturb
the party.

2102
01:49:47,083 --> 01:49:48,542
I assure you.

2103
01:49:49,708 --> 01:49:51,417
He's spoiling my peace.

2104
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,833
Take me away!
- What's going on here?

2105
01:49:54,917 --> 01:49:55,920
I'm taking wife.

2106
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:56,958
Who's wife?

2107
01:49:57,083 --> 01:49:58,083
My wife, of course.

2108
01:49:58,833 --> 01:49:59,542
Bye, stepmom.

2109
01:49:59,625 --> 01:50:02,250
Hey, don't irritate saying stepmom
every now and then.

2110
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,125
Don't take bad step.

2111
01:50:06,458 --> 01:50:08,792
Laya, I'm so sorry.

2112
01:50:09,833 --> 01:50:11,583
Please, understand me.

2113
01:50:12,458 --> 01:50:15,083
I'd been understanding you
since childhood.

2114
01:50:19,083 --> 01:50:21,042
I agree to that 100 percent.

2115
01:50:21,125 --> 01:50:23,333
Hey, Ullas.
- Hello, lawyer.

2116
01:50:24,708 --> 01:50:26,625
Mommy, daddy, too?

2117
01:50:26,958 --> 01:50:30,625
People here shamelessly invite for
parties after divorce, too?

2118
01:50:30,708 --> 01:50:34,250
Ullas..
- Even if they did, how'd you come?

2119
01:50:34,333 --> 01:50:35,542
But in India, once divorced

2120
01:50:35,625 --> 01:50:37,708
everything falls apart.

2121
01:50:37,792 --> 01:50:38,625
What say, lawyer.

2122
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,375
This is common here.

2123
01:50:40,583 --> 01:50:41,833
By the way, Ullas

2124
01:50:42,042 --> 01:50:45,125
my husband is complaining
of body pains since two days.

2125
01:50:45,208 --> 01:50:49,250
Where did you two go?
- I won't tell, sister.

2126
01:50:49,833 --> 01:50:50,625
You, too, brother.

2127
01:50:59,292 --> 01:51:01,750
Hi, pal. I pledged my house
and gave advance amount to all.

2128
01:51:01,833 --> 01:51:03,083
When would you send the dollars?

2129
01:51:06,083 --> 01:51:08,833
I'm too tired,
call me in the morning.

2130
01:51:08,917 --> 01:51:11,292
I am all tensed.
Don't sleep yet.

2131
01:51:32,208 --> 01:51:37,458
Hey, husband and wife must have
mutual consent to make love.

2132
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:41,042
It's the same in India, too.

2133
01:51:47,167 --> 01:51:49,000
You chew my lips.

2134
01:51:50,667 --> 01:51:54,000
Is this how violent it becomes

2135
01:51:56,042 --> 01:51:57,667
when wives get drunk?

2136
01:51:57,750 --> 01:51:59,333
If they know this in India

2137
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:05,250
nobody would dare to marry.

2138
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Hi, Mr. Sanchi.

2139
01:55:35,708 --> 01:55:40,458
Hey, Ullas. Laya has changed a lot.
Did you hit or abuse her?

2140
01:55:40,708 --> 01:55:44,958
I thought it's manly to keep
wife under control.

2141
01:55:45,417 --> 01:55:48,167
But, I learnt that joy
is in understanding wife.

2142
01:55:48,917 --> 01:55:52,250
So, you decided to stay with her
forever.

2143
01:55:52,875 --> 01:55:56,208
If I were in her situation,
she wouldn't leave me.

2144
01:55:57,167 --> 01:56:00,792
I am not born on foreign land

2145
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,542
to love my wife for a while
and then leave her.

2146
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,167
I am from village.

2147
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:08,167
She married with lots
of trust in me.

2148
01:56:09,750 --> 01:56:11,375
I'll keep up her trust.

2149
01:56:25,542 --> 01:56:26,167
Come on.

2150
01:56:27,125 --> 01:56:28,667
Oh, I missed it.

2151
01:56:28,958 --> 01:56:30,042
Wow!

2152
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:32,250
Hi, mom.
- Hi.

2153
01:56:32,375 --> 01:56:34,000
Hi, dad. - Hi.
Hi, stepmom.

2154
01:56:34,625 --> 01:56:35,792
Hi, stepdad.

2155
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Now tell me step by step.

2156
01:56:39,833 --> 01:56:41,875
Ullas, good news for you.

2157
01:56:42,875 --> 01:56:45,292
Court consented to release
Laya's money.

2158
01:56:45,667 --> 01:56:47,583
Oh, that's great news.

2159
01:56:48,250 --> 01:56:51,125
Money will be in your account.
Tamanna agreed for that, too.

2160
01:56:51,875 --> 01:56:52,962
Thank you, second mom.

2161
01:56:53,042 --> 01:56:57,958
Ullas, only you could understand
Laya better.

2162
01:57:00,542 --> 01:57:04,042
And we believe that only you can
take good care of her.

2163
01:57:28,625 --> 01:57:29,167
Hi, Ullas.

2164
01:57:29,625 --> 01:57:31,458
Hey, where are you?


2165
01:57:32,083 --> 01:57:34,667
I trusted you and pledged my house
for investment.

2166
01:57:34,875 --> 01:57:36,083
Hey, speak up, dude.

2167
01:57:38,042 --> 01:57:39,000
You told that we'll start business

2168
01:57:39,083 --> 01:57:41,000
with the money you'd send
and also that I'm the boss.

2169
01:57:44,042 --> 01:57:45,583
You cheated me in the name
of friendship.

2170
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:48,250
You cheated Patel's sister
in the name of love.

2171
01:57:50,292 --> 01:57:52,167
Now that Laya's got money

2172
01:57:52,250 --> 01:57:54,083
you told her lies about
childhood love

2173
01:57:54,375 --> 01:57:57,083
and married her.

2174
01:57:57,292 --> 01:57:59,208
You cheated your wife, as well.

2175
01:58:00,083 --> 01:58:01,958
Hey, where are you?

2176
01:58:10,292 --> 01:58:12,667
Sorry, ma'am.
Dialed wrong number.

2177
01:58:30,458 --> 01:58:32,000
I'm not mad at you.

2178
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:34,208
Because

2179
01:58:35,167 --> 01:58:38,333
I lost it to my parents.

2180
01:58:39,208 --> 01:58:41,792
After marriage, I lost it to you.

2181
01:58:44,792 --> 01:58:46,000
Not much difference.

2182
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:49,958
Laya, Bose was right

2183
01:58:50,333 --> 01:58:53,458
I'm mad for money,
that's why married you.

2184
01:58:56,167 --> 01:58:59,167
But, after learning the reason
behind your condition

2185
01:58:59,625 --> 01:59:02,042
after understanding how much
you trust me

2186
01:59:02,292 --> 01:59:04,875
I changed for good.
Trust me.

2187
01:59:05,208 --> 01:59:08,542
It takes one moment to break
the trust.

2188
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:14,792
But it takes a life time to gain
it back.

2189
01:59:15,875 --> 01:59:17,000
I won't trust you.

2190
01:59:17,458 --> 01:59:20,875
When we're in problem,
we can't hug ourselves.

2191
01:59:21,042 --> 01:59:23,792
We don't lean on our shoulder.

2192
01:59:24,333 --> 01:59:26,000
We need someone as support
for that.

2193
01:59:26,667 --> 01:59:29,250
I'll be that support for you.

2194
01:59:30,083 --> 01:59:31,875
But if you cheat me again,

2195
01:59:32,083 --> 01:59:35,208
I am not left with tears, too.

2196
01:59:36,750 --> 01:59:39,708
Problems give tears.

2197
01:59:40,333 --> 01:59:43,917
Someone closer like me
gives tears of joy.

2198
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:47,042
I will live with you.

2199
01:59:47,333 --> 01:59:48,292
I'm sorry.

2200
01:59:49,042 --> 01:59:51,958
I can't turn another page
in the book of my life

2201
01:59:52,958 --> 01:59:55,208
except closing the book.

2202
01:59:56,167 --> 01:59:57,458
I want to divorce.

2203
02:00:23,125 --> 02:00:24,875
I loved her sincerely
but she asked for divorce.

2204
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:26,708
I will teach her lesson.
- Dude.

2205
02:00:27,208 --> 02:00:30,833
Don't step back, my best wishes
with you. Bye. - Hold on.

2206
02:00:31,417 --> 02:00:32,542
I'll enter the house now.

2207
02:00:32,625 --> 02:00:34,208
You'll hear a sound.

2208
02:00:34,625 --> 02:00:35,917
And a shriek.

2209
02:00:36,125 --> 02:00:37,083
And then a scream.

2210
02:00:39,208 --> 02:00:40,917
Followed by my laughter.
Then you'll enter.

2211
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:41,583
What for?

2212
02:00:41,875 --> 02:00:43,917
To take her dead body
to the hospital. - I see.

2213
02:00:44,417 --> 02:00:46,292
I will kill her

2214
02:00:46,458 --> 02:00:47,750
but I won't divorce her.

2215
02:00:56,583 --> 02:00:57,417
Greetings, ma'am.

2216
02:01:00,583 --> 02:01:01,750
Husband and wife begin their love

2217
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,042
with glass of milk in our culture.

2218
02:01:05,458 --> 02:01:07,417
But you started with a peg.

2219
02:01:07,833 --> 02:01:11,625
Yet, I understood and loved you

2220
02:01:11,875 --> 02:01:13,292
but you ask for divorce.

2221
02:01:13,667 --> 02:01:17,708
Do you think it's easy?
- Hey, shut up.

2222
02:01:17,917 --> 02:01:21,875
Oh, if I watch you again
with alcohol

2223
02:01:22,042 --> 02:01:25,000
you'll hear a sound,
and then a shriek.

2224
02:01:25,083 --> 02:01:27,417
The head will break, you see.

2225
02:01:30,875 --> 02:01:31,917
Oh, no!

2226
02:01:32,167 --> 02:01:34,833
Oh, gosh! Did he really kill her?

2227
02:01:40,083 --> 02:01:45,417
Call 911 immediately.

2228
02:01:55,250 --> 02:01:56,000
Blood?

2229
02:02:04,292 --> 02:02:07,708
Life is not so beautiful.
- Painful.

2230
02:02:08,208 --> 02:02:08,917
You'll be alright.

2231
02:02:14,292 --> 02:02:15,125
Police!

2232
02:02:15,208 --> 02:02:16,167
Tell me what happened.

2233
02:02:16,958 --> 02:02:19,083
My wife beat with bottle.

2234
02:02:21,667 --> 02:02:23,167
If you say that, they'll
put her in jail.

2235
02:02:23,250 --> 02:02:24,292
No, no.

2236
02:02:24,375 --> 02:02:27,042
She is a mad.

2237
02:02:27,708 --> 02:02:29,750
Whom do you call a lunatic?

2238
02:02:30,625 --> 02:02:32,962
Ullas. - If I didn't say that
you'll be in jail.

2239
02:02:33,042 --> 02:02:34,417
Don't pretend to be good.

2240
02:02:34,875 --> 02:02:36,292
You know what?

2241
02:02:36,458 --> 02:02:38,625
He didn't call me mad
with love

2242
02:02:38,833 --> 02:02:40,000
but for my money.

2243
02:02:41,042 --> 02:02:42,792
Oh, really!

2244
02:02:43,083 --> 02:02:44,500
Hey.
- Hey!

2245
02:02:44,583 --> 02:02:45,792
Hold on, no fighting.
Let's compromise.

2246
02:02:45,917 --> 02:02:46,875
No compromise.

2247
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:48,250
Visitors time is up,
you may leave.

2248
02:02:48,333 --> 02:02:50,458
We husband and wife have
to talk in person.

2249
02:02:50,583 --> 02:02:51,875
We know when to leave.

2250
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,333
Hello, excuse me.

2251
02:02:53,542 --> 02:02:56,375
Here only mad patients are allowed.

2252
02:02:56,542 --> 02:02:58,625
If you call me mad again.
- No.

2253
02:02:58,792 --> 02:03:00,458
Look at her, doctor.

2254
02:03:00,708 --> 02:03:02,167
She's behaving like a ghost.

2255
02:03:02,333 --> 02:03:03,583
She's trying to kill me.

2256
02:03:03,667 --> 02:03:05,833
We need to send her
to rehabilitation centre.

2257
02:03:05,958 --> 02:03:06,792
Is that a coaching centre?

2258
02:03:06,958 --> 02:03:07,917
No, counseling centre.

2259
02:03:08,042 --> 02:03:09,333
They heal on psychological level.

2260
02:03:09,458 --> 02:03:12,000
Oh, I see.
Doctor, please help me.

2261
02:03:12,167 --> 02:03:14,167
Put her into the rehab centre.
Save her life

2262
02:03:14,333 --> 02:03:15,958
and mine, also.
- Okay.

2263
02:03:16,042 --> 02:03:16,750
Please, do it.

2264
02:03:18,625 --> 02:03:21,292
They will send you to rehab centre.

2265
02:03:22,125 --> 02:03:23,667
That's impossible.

2266
02:03:24,958 --> 02:03:29,000
Laya, tomorrow is the hearing
of your divorce. And, Mr. Ullas

2267
02:03:29,208 --> 02:03:33,042
there is no lawyer
to argue on your behalf.

2268
02:03:33,208 --> 02:03:38,458
As long as I am here, you can't
live with Laya. - Thank you.

2269
02:03:55,667 --> 02:03:57,125
So, you don't have a councilor?

2270
02:03:58,667 --> 02:04:00,458
I have not found one.

2271
02:04:00,958 --> 02:04:02,333
Defendant, you may proceed.

2272
02:04:02,792 --> 02:04:04,458
I don't want divorce.

2273
02:04:04,625 --> 02:04:05,833
I'm sorry?

2274
02:04:06,542 --> 02:04:07,708
I need a translator.

2275
02:04:08,250 --> 02:04:09,167
Pardon me.

2276
02:04:10,667 --> 02:04:12,125
I need a translator.

2277
02:04:12,667 --> 02:04:13,667
Okay.

2278
02:04:14,750 --> 02:04:16,167
Mr. Sanchi, please come.

2279
02:04:24,542 --> 02:04:26,417
I dropped my purse somewhere
around.

2280
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:35,875
Actually the problem is,
she's..

2281
02:04:35,958 --> 02:04:36,625
Sir

2282
02:04:37,875 --> 02:04:39,083
I will be his translator.

2283
02:04:39,417 --> 02:04:40,292
What's your name?

2284
02:04:40,542 --> 02:04:41,458
Jimmy Madugula.

2285
02:04:41,833 --> 02:04:42,833
You can proceed.

2286
02:04:43,167 --> 02:04:44,042
Thank you, sir.

2287
02:04:51,458 --> 02:04:52,583
Talk carefully.

2288
02:04:53,417 --> 02:04:55,125
Don't turn this into murder case.

2289
02:04:55,375 --> 02:04:56,042
Trust me.

2290
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:58,125
You can establish a trust later

2291
02:04:58,208 --> 02:04:59,792
first translate for me properly.

2292
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,042
So that's what you understood?

2293
02:05:01,792 --> 02:05:03,708
So, are you willing to give her
the divorce?

2294
02:05:03,917 --> 02:05:06,000
No, no. No divorce.

2295
02:05:06,625 --> 02:05:07,583
You speak in Telugu

2296
02:05:07,792 --> 02:05:08,958
I'll translate to English.

2297
02:05:09,292 --> 02:05:10,333
That's what I came for.

2298
02:05:12,375 --> 02:05:13,750
Now, if I divorce her..

2299
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:14,958
If I give divorce.

2300
02:05:15,375 --> 02:05:17,250
it's equal to letting someone die.

2301
02:05:17,417 --> 02:05:19,792
It will be given to someone
get suicide.

2302
02:05:20,625 --> 02:05:23,667
My wife is a addict,
she needs treatment.

2303
02:05:24,542 --> 02:05:26,667
My wife is addict,
she needs treatment.

2304
02:05:26,875 --> 02:05:27,625
I heard that.

2305
02:05:28,833 --> 02:05:31,042
You confused all and ruined it.

2306
02:05:31,292 --> 02:05:32,375
Please, continue.

2307
02:05:32,875 --> 02:05:36,458
Patients never agree to get
treatment, especially mental.

2308
02:05:37,083 --> 02:05:38,833
Some patients refuse medication

2309
02:05:39,375 --> 02:05:42,375
especially, those who are having
mental problems.

2310
02:05:43,042 --> 02:05:45,167
But, we need to get them treated.

2311
02:05:45,333 --> 02:05:48,750
Wife and husband are like two
vessels in the kitchen.

2312
02:05:48,958 --> 02:05:51,042
When they hit each other,
sound produces.

2313
02:05:51,208 --> 02:05:52,917
I can't translate,
change the proverb.

2314
02:05:53,167 --> 02:05:54,083
I know only that.

2315
02:05:55,125 --> 02:05:58,042
In a family, wife is one pot

2316
02:05:58,292 --> 02:05:59,667
and husband is another pot.

2317
02:05:59,750 --> 02:06:03,042
When two pots come together
it makes sound.

2318
02:06:03,208 --> 02:06:06,625
Cling-cling.

2319
02:06:07,083 --> 02:06:08,333
I guess he didn't understand.

2320
02:06:08,583 --> 02:06:10,750
I beg you, never mention
such similes.

2321
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:11,625
Alright.

2322
02:06:12,625 --> 02:06:16,625
I want my wife back
with brilliance and vigor.

2323
02:06:16,750 --> 02:06:18,583
Kill me, I say, with your diction.

2324
02:06:18,833 --> 02:06:21,250
Mr. Jimmy. That's not allowed
in the court room.

2325
02:06:21,667 --> 02:06:23,042
I want my wife back

2326
02:06:23,250 --> 02:06:25,000
with a lots of brilliance
and vigor.

2327
02:06:25,125 --> 02:06:26,708
Yeah.
- What do you mean?

2328
02:06:27,625 --> 02:06:28,833
He didn't get that, too.

2329
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:30,250
Mr. Jimmy?

2330
02:06:32,083 --> 02:06:33,375
Sir, one life line needed.

2331
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:37,125
What life line?
- Phone a friend.

2332
02:06:37,583 --> 02:06:38,250
Phone?

2333
02:06:38,958 --> 02:06:40,833
Please, sir. One call.

2334
02:06:41,125 --> 02:06:41,917
Okay.

2335
02:06:48,708 --> 02:06:49,750
Chellappa.

2336
02:06:49,833 --> 02:06:50,375
Jimmy speaking.

2337
02:06:50,458 --> 02:06:52,125
'So you're still alive?'

2338
02:06:52,708 --> 02:06:54,000
I was alive until now.

2339
02:06:54,458 --> 02:06:56,250
If I didn't answer his question,
he'll hang me.

2340
02:06:56,333 --> 02:06:58,167
'Then let's party.'

2341
02:06:58,250 --> 02:07:00,042
Are you still asleep?

2342
02:07:00,333 --> 02:07:02,250
Tell me in what context
does brilliance and vigor mean?

2343
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:08,708
The words he used are poetic

2344
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:10,958
which mean health and beauty.

2345
02:07:11,333 --> 02:07:15,417
As a kid, Laya used to call me
with love.

2346
02:07:15,792 --> 02:07:17,625
I still remember that.

2347
02:07:17,792 --> 02:07:19,917
Getting that joy back to her

2348
02:07:20,042 --> 02:07:22,208
is only possible with love.

2349
02:07:22,417 --> 02:07:25,000
I'll cure her with love.

2350
02:07:25,292 --> 02:07:25,875
Come on.

2351
02:07:27,875 --> 02:07:29,000
I can repair her

2352
02:07:29,542 --> 02:07:30,917
while making love with her.

2353
02:07:36,625 --> 02:07:37,583
Everything is spoilt.

2354
02:07:37,875 --> 02:07:41,042
Your honor. A mistake,
that didn't come out right.

2355
02:07:41,542 --> 02:07:43,042
I can be a better chance later.

2356
02:07:43,583 --> 02:07:44,292
Who are you?

2357
02:07:44,625 --> 02:07:48,000
I am Jimmy's wife and we've been
together for seven years.

2358
02:07:48,125 --> 02:07:49,792
And I understand the language.

2359
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:51,250
Okay, what did he say?

2360
02:07:51,667 --> 02:07:53,042
He said he can cure

2361
02:07:53,208 --> 02:07:56,042
and make her better person
with the magic of love.

2362
02:07:56,292 --> 02:08:00,708
And as we all know, love is the
best medicine in the world.

2363
02:08:10,333 --> 02:08:11,792
Can't you tell him to remove
the hand?

2364
02:08:12,542 --> 02:08:14,000
He might have touched me
by mistake.

2365
02:08:14,083 --> 02:08:15,417
Would you accept anything done
by mistake?

2366
02:08:16,417 --> 02:08:18,750
I'm not such person.
You smell good.

2367
02:08:19,083 --> 02:08:19,750
Thank you.
- Welcome.

2368
02:08:19,833 --> 02:08:21,042
What did he whisper in your ear?

2369
02:08:22,042 --> 02:08:25,083
Please, we're in the court room.
Just shut up.

2370
02:08:26,042 --> 02:08:27,375
Petition is dismissed.

2371
02:08:30,208 --> 02:08:31,375
Objection, your honor.

2372
02:08:31,792 --> 02:08:32,583
Proceed.

2373
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:36,000
If my client has any disease
or addiction

2374
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:39,125
her parents can provide her
with best of the best treatment.

2375
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:42,000
My wife has two fathers
and two mothers.

2376
02:08:42,417 --> 02:08:43,792
That is too much for her

2377
02:08:44,125 --> 02:08:46,083
and that is one of her biggest
problems, too.

2378
02:08:46,458 --> 02:08:47,917
That's not true, sir.

2379
02:08:48,625 --> 02:08:52,625
Mr. Ullas believes that he can cure
my client with love

2380
02:08:52,792 --> 02:08:55,917
but love is not a scientifically
proven medicine.

2381
02:08:56,042 --> 02:08:58,875
We always say God is love,
don't we?

2382
02:08:59,042 --> 02:09:00,792
Do you believe in God?
- I do.

2383
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:02,708
Without scientific evidence?

2384
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:04,875
Yes, sir.

2385
02:09:09,333 --> 02:09:11,042
I think love should always win.

2386
02:09:12,333 --> 02:09:15,792
And the patient should be treated
with patience and kindness.

2387
02:09:16,375 --> 02:09:18,625
Let's give a chance to this
relationship.

2388
02:09:19,875 --> 02:09:22,292
This divorce petition
is rejected.

2389
02:09:49,875 --> 02:09:51,250
This is a divorce case

2390
02:09:51,667 --> 02:09:53,917
then why is Laya being taken
to rehab centre?

2391
02:09:54,625 --> 02:09:57,542
Ullas requested
and judge accepted.

2392
02:09:57,792 --> 02:09:59,000
I couldn't help.

2393
02:10:01,292 --> 02:10:04,250
Don't underestimate the power
of a common man.

2394
02:10:04,750 --> 02:10:06,792
I thought winning this case
would be a cake walk.

2395
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:09,250
Now what do I answer
my seniors?

2396
02:10:09,750 --> 02:10:12,125
I will win this case
by any means.

2397
02:10:12,417 --> 02:10:13,250
Just watch.

2398
02:10:14,833 --> 02:10:17,208
Don't pretend innocence anymore.
I'll kill you.

2399
02:10:17,917 --> 02:10:19,083
Are you threatening me?

2400
02:10:19,333 --> 02:10:21,083
Nobody's going to be scared
of you.

2401
02:10:21,333 --> 02:10:24,042
What do you want?
Tell me, we'll give.

2402
02:10:24,333 --> 02:10:26,958
I want what all of you want.
Laya.

2403
02:10:27,208 --> 02:10:28,583
I want her to be fine.

2404
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,833
She offered me money
to divorce her.

2405
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,167
If I agreed to do so

2406
02:10:36,542 --> 02:10:38,250
she'd get another reason
to drink.

2407
02:10:39,250 --> 02:10:40,583
If she continues to drink

2408
02:10:40,958 --> 02:10:42,708
she'll die after some days.

2409
02:10:42,875 --> 02:10:45,250
You may take your daughter's
death easy

2410
02:10:45,833 --> 02:10:47,667
but I can't see my wife die.

2411
02:10:55,792 --> 02:10:58,875
You married Laya only for money.

2412
02:10:59,083 --> 02:11:01,958
How to believe that your love
would cure her?

2413
02:11:02,125 --> 02:11:04,167
You don't need mineral water
to extinguish fire

2414
02:11:04,542 --> 02:11:07,167
even dirty water can do the job.

2415
02:11:07,667 --> 02:11:09,125
Some time back
I loved her money

2416
02:11:09,708 --> 02:11:12,708
but now I love only her.

2417
02:11:13,708 --> 02:11:16,583
You're sending her
to rehabilitation centre.

2418
02:11:16,917 --> 02:11:18,583
She'll be mad at you.

2419
02:11:18,917 --> 02:11:20,667
If court has to approve
her divorce

2420
02:11:20,917 --> 02:11:23,417
she must prove herself
quitting of addiction.

2421
02:11:23,792 --> 02:11:26,792
She'd do that somehow
to revenge me.

2422
02:11:27,250 --> 02:11:30,333
You can even fill her mind
against me

2423
02:11:30,583 --> 02:11:31,667
to get her more angry with me.

2424
02:11:31,875 --> 02:11:33,792
Don't worry about that.

2425
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:36,042
She can use all her power
to break the relationships.

2426
02:11:36,375 --> 02:11:37,583
She's a specialist.

2427
02:11:37,792 --> 02:11:39,875
It's a compliment, dear.

2428
02:11:41,125 --> 02:11:43,833
If a couple breeds hatred
for each other

2429
02:11:44,292 --> 02:11:45,667
how would you live
in the future?

2430
02:11:46,583 --> 02:11:49,083
First, all that matters is to get
back Laya to normalcy.

2431
02:11:49,583 --> 02:11:53,083
Then you all can tell her
what happened.

2432
02:13:30,042 --> 02:13:31,458
So what you think about this sir.

2433
02:13:31,750 --> 02:13:34,042
Decision by the court
has been already file.

2434
02:13:34,333 --> 02:13:36,708
We cannot allow a quick settlement.

2435
02:15:14,250 --> 02:15:16,667
Hey! Congratulations, Laya.
- Thank you, aunt.

2436
02:15:16,875 --> 02:15:20,292
I never expected you'd recover
so quick.

2437
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:22,625
I must thank Ullas for that.

2438
02:15:22,833 --> 02:15:26,708
Had such fraud not entered my life,
I wouldn't have changed at all.

2439
02:15:27,125 --> 02:15:29,292
You've mistaken him.

2440
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:31,750
The reason for your change..

2441
02:15:33,208 --> 02:15:35,125
Don't tell me about that fraud.

2442
02:15:35,333 --> 02:15:39,000
He'd boast himself the reason
for my recovery.

2443
02:15:39,333 --> 02:15:41,292
She told me everything about him.

2444
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Smart.

2445
02:15:46,833 --> 02:15:48,292
Excuse me.
- Okay.

2446
02:15:48,917 --> 02:15:50,667
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

2447
02:15:50,750 --> 02:15:54,042
Oh, so everybody's here.

2448
02:15:55,250 --> 02:15:56,792
You are all doing mistake.

2449
02:15:58,542 --> 02:16:02,333
He sacrificed believing that we'd
get them back together.

2450
02:16:03,333 --> 02:16:05,208
Keeping the secret from Laya

2451
02:16:05,542 --> 02:16:07,250
we're cheating Ullas.

2452
02:16:07,708 --> 02:16:09,167
This is not right.

2453
02:16:09,667 --> 02:16:11,375
It's the hatred for Ullas

2454
02:16:11,583 --> 02:16:14,792
that helped Laya recover.

2455
02:16:15,167 --> 02:16:17,542
Doctor suggests to continue
the same.

2456
02:16:18,125 --> 02:16:20,167
If we tell her about Ullas

2457
02:16:20,583 --> 02:16:22,962
she might get back to her past.

2458
02:16:23,042 --> 02:16:23,917
You're right.

2459
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:26,333
It's better they stay apart
for a while.

2460
02:16:28,542 --> 02:16:30,583
You try to convince him

2461
02:16:31,167 --> 02:16:33,250
and coerce for divorce.
Please.

2462
02:16:46,667 --> 02:16:49,208
Ullas, don't you worry.

2463
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Everybody knows the truth.

2464
02:16:51,417 --> 02:16:53,958
Shall we talk to Laya?
- No, don't.

2465
02:16:54,708 --> 02:16:57,042
It's better that she keeps away
from alcohol with hatred for me

2466
02:16:57,375 --> 02:16:59,417
than to drink with vengeance
over me.

2467
02:17:02,458 --> 02:17:06,000
I'll sign the divorce papers
and go back to India.

2468
02:17:06,958 --> 02:17:08,875
You will have to help me
get a flight ticket.

2469
02:17:09,667 --> 02:17:11,125
Not required.

2470
02:17:12,167 --> 02:17:16,417
Laya's parents gave you
this cheque.

2471
02:17:25,750 --> 02:17:27,042
They paid me

2472
02:17:27,458 --> 02:17:29,208
to leave from here.

2473
02:19:00,458 --> 02:19:03,208
'Laya, I called you number
of times'

2474
02:19:03,667 --> 02:19:05,083
'but you didn't take my calls.'

2475
02:19:05,667 --> 02:19:08,000
'I know you'd be holding drink.'

2476
02:19:12,167 --> 02:19:14,000
'That's why I kept this note
in the bottle.'

2477
02:19:15,375 --> 02:19:18,458
'I am going back with a lesson'

2478
02:19:18,708 --> 02:19:21,000
'that money can't give
joy what a good heart can'.

2479
02:19:21,167 --> 02:19:23,667
'Otherwise, I'd have accepted the
cheque your parents offered.'

2480
02:19:37,417 --> 02:19:40,375
'People go back to rectify their
mistakes.'

2481
02:19:41,042 --> 02:19:42,750
'One needs courage to do so.'

2482
02:19:43,083 --> 02:19:44,667
'You gave me that courage.'

2483
02:19:49,792 --> 02:19:53,000
'Sometimes, we win by losing.'

2484
02:19:53,417 --> 02:19:56,750
'I learnt that we love by hating.'

2485
02:19:57,042 --> 02:20:00,667
'Laya, there are two devils
in your life'

2486
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:03,167
'one is liquor,
and the other is me.'

2487
02:20:07,250 --> 02:20:09,167
'You left the two with courage.'

2488
02:20:09,792 --> 02:20:13,042
'I wish you continue to live
happily all life'

2489
02:20:13,458 --> 02:20:15,792
'with the same courage.'

2490
02:20:46,917 --> 02:20:49,958
He is not the same Ullas anymore.

2491
02:20:50,083 --> 02:20:51,208
The one belonging to
new generation.

2492
02:20:53,250 --> 02:20:56,333
What's the guarantee
that you wouldn't cheat me again?

2493
02:20:57,917 --> 02:21:00,792
I came back to correct my mistakes.

2494
02:21:03,583 --> 02:21:05,875
Mr. Patel, you can trust him.

2495
02:21:06,375 --> 02:21:08,208
If he misses his promise this time

2496
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,042
I will kill both of you.

2497
02:21:14,417 --> 02:21:17,250
Trust me, I won't go back
on my word.

2498
02:21:38,333 --> 02:21:43,125
I thought he loved me,
when actually he didn't.

2499
02:21:44,208 --> 02:21:48,000
But when he loved me,
I didn't believe it.

2500
02:21:48,583 --> 02:21:52,375
Laya, now you understood him well.

2501
02:21:53,292 --> 02:21:56,583
When I told him to leave
as you won't live long

2502
02:21:57,625 --> 02:21:59,833
he made you a better person.

2503
02:22:04,708 --> 02:22:08,792
Now when we told him that you'd be
happy away from him

2504
02:22:09,333 --> 02:22:11,125
he left quietly.

2505
02:22:12,167 --> 02:22:13,708
It's not the mistake of any
of us.

2506
02:22:15,917 --> 02:22:19,750
Mrs. Murthy, my wife coerced
doctors to lie.

2507
02:22:19,958 --> 02:22:21,068
Sorry, Laya.

2508
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,625
I wanted to part you two
to win the case.

2509
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:30,583
But, he went away
and won your heart.

2510
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:40,917
A mother would always pray

2511
02:22:42,042 --> 02:22:45,125
that her daughter gets a good
husband like Ullas.

2512
02:22:50,375 --> 02:22:51,544
But, it's too late.

2513
02:22:55,958 --> 02:22:58,750
You look weird in that turban.

2514
02:22:59,375 --> 02:23:00,542
Keep this inside.

2515
02:23:00,792 --> 02:23:01,875
Brother-in-law, are you ready?

2516
02:23:02,042 --> 02:23:03,042
What got you delayed?

2517
02:23:03,167 --> 02:23:04,083
Flight was delayed.

2518
02:23:04,250 --> 02:23:05,250
Delayed flight?

2519
02:23:05,458 --> 02:23:07,250
Not mine, but theirs.

2520
02:23:33,750 --> 02:23:37,000
Don't change your mind in haste.
Patel will kill us.

2521
02:23:39,583 --> 02:23:42,000
Ullas, this is your life

2522
02:23:42,375 --> 02:23:44,958
don't give ear to anybody.
Don't leave Laya.

2523
02:23:51,292 --> 02:23:53,000
Can I have a minute with you?

2524
02:24:16,625 --> 02:24:18,208
Thanks a lot.

2525
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:21,292
I changed for good
only with your love.

2526
02:24:22,625 --> 02:24:24,250
Even I changed because of you.

2527
02:24:25,750 --> 02:24:26,792
Thank you, Laya.

2528
02:24:27,875 --> 02:24:30,625
You may have 100 reasons
to change

2529
02:24:31,167 --> 02:24:35,000
but you're the only reason
for me to change.

2530
02:24:35,417 --> 02:24:36,792
Whatever be the reason

2531
02:24:37,292 --> 02:24:39,125
they shouldn't part.

2532
02:24:39,292 --> 02:24:41,125
I don't know if I should
mourn their separation

2533
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,792
or be happy that he changed
for good.

2534
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,333
I didn't come to take away
your happiness.

2535
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:49,917
I know that I'm not the right one
for you.

2536
02:24:50,583 --> 02:24:52,875
But, only you are the right one
for me.

2537
02:24:54,833 --> 02:24:56,625
I can assure you one thing

2538
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,292
that I won't step back into past.

2539
02:25:01,208 --> 02:25:03,458
I know, it's too late.

2540
02:25:05,333 --> 02:25:08,000
We came here to get them
back together.

2541
02:25:08,250 --> 02:25:11,750
Let's give Patel any amount
as compensation.

2542
02:25:12,750 --> 02:25:14,875
Once I made a mistake for money

2543
02:25:15,333 --> 02:25:16,875
now I can't repeat it.

2544
02:25:17,125 --> 02:25:19,917
Ullas, you are like rainbow

2545
02:25:20,458 --> 02:25:23,292
always bright and happy

2546
02:25:24,208 --> 02:25:26,917
but not for long.

2547
02:25:30,833 --> 02:25:34,625
Laya is our daughter-in-law,
we'll change his decision.

2548
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:38,083
Brother, we're getting late
for the wedding.

2549
02:25:51,125 --> 02:25:54,250
Why are we still here?
Let's go back.

2550
02:25:54,625 --> 02:25:56,667
We'll attend the wedding
and then leave.

2551
02:25:58,958 --> 02:26:00,583
I must watch this wedding

2552
02:26:01,333 --> 02:26:03,208
to clear him from my heart

2553
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:06,292
as he left my life.

2554
02:27:06,958 --> 02:27:10,333
Welcome! Hold on.

2555
02:27:10,667 --> 02:27:14,042
My future brother-in-law,
my sister's fiancé

2556
02:27:14,167 --> 02:27:16,333
has arrived!
There he is.

2557
02:27:31,292 --> 02:27:35,000
Now let me introduce him
to you all.

2558
02:27:35,167 --> 02:27:38,125
Welcome, Mr. Ullas.

2559
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,490
He is the groom, Ullas,
not you, fool.

2560
02:28:07,292 --> 02:28:09,936
Welcome, Ullas.

2561
02:28:16,167 --> 02:28:19,875
You fooled my sister
amidst four walls.

2562
02:28:20,042 --> 02:28:23,083
But I decided to fool you
in the crowd.

2563
02:28:23,375 --> 02:28:25,625
I saw her tears just once

2564
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,875
now let me see yours.

2565
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,083
Finally, I got you.

2566
02:28:30,458 --> 02:28:33,458
No bloodshed, no fight

2567
02:28:33,708 --> 02:28:36,958
no death, yet I revenged.

2568
02:28:37,542 --> 02:28:39,333
This is what you call
vengeance.

2569
02:28:39,667 --> 02:28:41,045
Just cry for once.

2570
02:28:41,125 --> 02:28:42,333
Come on.

2571
02:28:42,667 --> 02:28:43,545
Come on, cry.

2572
02:28:43,625 --> 02:28:46,125
You get your sister married to him,
then he will watch and cry.

2573
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:49,608
He will cry.
Go and marry her.
