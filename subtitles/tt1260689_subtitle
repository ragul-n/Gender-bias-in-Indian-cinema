1
00:02:14,535 --> 00:02:16,435
Have you still not learnt how to
roll the joint with your hands?

2
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:28,578
True. With one hand,
handle only one vice.

3
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,610
Don't mix both the things.

4
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,411
Correct!

5
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,518
Guys, who is this Priyadarshini
Mattu?

6
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:48,058
Some girl... who was raped
and then murdered.

7
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,631
Or maybe the reverse.

8
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:56,534
What's with you, Rahul?

9
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:00,071
Who will do this?

10
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,077
People are capable
of doing anything.

11
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,844
Now you understand why
I don't leave Bhagani alone...

12
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,081
...with the dead bodies
in the morgue.

13
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,891
Hey, you! I am a virgin!
Not a desperate man!

14
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:21,328
Okay! I am desperate! But rape!

15
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,197
Come on, man! I too have
certain standards!

16
00:03:25,272 --> 00:03:26,330
Yeah?

17
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,937
Did something move?

18
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:36,040
Everything is moving, man!

19
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:43,183
Hey! What are you doing?
It's still left!

20
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,618
Look! The farmer has awakened!

21
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,222
Harvest, grass, seeds.

22
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,421
He wants everything!

23
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,898
Hey, when you consume
my vineyard's wine...

24
00:03:51,932 --> 00:03:53,399
...you call me a prince.

25
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:55,628
And now a farmer! Fine!

26
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,061
I am not saying anything wrong!

27
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,540
Earlier you were a prince.
Now you are a farmer.

28
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:01,966
I called you both!

29
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,373
You idiot!
Right? No, I mean...

30
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,891
Rolls Royce's new Phantom
has arrived in India.

31
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,895
Do you know that Samantha Fox
is a lesbian?

32
00:04:25,165 --> 00:04:26,257
Who has it?

33
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:30,098
Not who... she.

34
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:31,996
The Phantom!

35
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:38,543
Rahul!
Yes!

36
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:41,272
What?

37
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,176
What?

38
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:32,889
Here.

39
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,928
You have still not laid
for day before yesterday.

40
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,940
Where is the car? The doctor
came for times for it.

41
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,145
Where is the car?

42
00:05:59,226 --> 00:06:00,215
I don't know.

43
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,322
Oh!

44
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:11,167
Tell him to collect
it from Tiger Tols.

45
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,066
And to take a crane along too.

46
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,036
Goodnight!
Goodnight!

47
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:20,112
"Summer 2007."

48
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,442
"Can you hear my name?"

49
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:24,177
"Summer 2007."

50
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,843
"Come on! Sing with me."

51
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,319
"Summer 2007."

52
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,413
"Can you see the fire?"

53
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,583
"Summer 2007."

54
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,151
Not bad.

55
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,890
Dr. Pandey, please report
at the OPD immediately.

56
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,397
Good. You are doing fine.

57
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,369
Dr. Thakkar! Hi!

58
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:45,928
Hello, Dr. Saraswat,
how do you do?

59
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:48,065
I am doing fine. Final
year students.

60
00:06:48,942 --> 00:06:52,275
And he is the famous bone
specialist, Dr. Thakkar.

61
00:06:52,946 --> 00:06:54,004
Hello!

62
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,139
Hello! How are you guys?

63
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,273
Good!
Good, sir!

64
00:06:56,483 --> 00:07:03,047
Well, according to you all...
what could be this lady's problem?

65
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,450
Anyone?

66
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,320
Sir!
Yes!

67
00:07:10,864 --> 00:07:12,331
Sir, she has pain
in her knee joints.

68
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,527
Maybe synovial
fluids have increased.

69
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,834
Anyone disagreeing?

70
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,566
Sir, I think its Padgett's disease.

71
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:23,369
Why did you say that?

72
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,403
Excuse me, sir!

73
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,913
Why did you say that?

74
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:37,349
Sir, actually... her blood test...
they indicate...

75
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,859
...certain alleviated alkaline
phosphate base.

76
00:07:42,396 --> 00:07:44,557
I must say... what's your name?

77
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,230
Sorry, sir! Rahul Sharma!

78
00:07:48,068 --> 00:07:52,937
Rahul Sharma... you are dead right.
Impressive!

79
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,201
Beginner's luck.

80
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,548
Sorry. It's ok.

81
00:08:08,221 --> 00:08:09,279
Hi.

82
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,327
What's it?
Wait!

83
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:19,030
How late is your period?
15 days.

84
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:22,533
15 days! O no! You are
in a big trouble, girl!

85
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,838
Your career, your future,
everything is in danger!

86
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,898
Abortion! From where will
you undergo abortion?

87
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,536
But why will you do it?

88
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,575
After all abortion is like murder.

89
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:37,975
And all your life you
will feel that guilt.

90
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:39,109
Will you keep quiet?

91
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:43,547
What is it?

92
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,017
What is it? Say something!

93
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:50,157
O no, man! O no! O no!

94
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:54,333
Who is the father?
Ajay or that Raman?

95
00:08:54,401 --> 00:08:55,595
Is it an intern?

96
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,302
Will you stop making me nervous?
I don't know.

97
00:08:59,005 --> 00:08:59,994
I don't know meaning?

98
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,472
You should know, Priyanka!

99
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,168
I don't know! Period!

100
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,038
Now let's hurry. Everybody is
on the round with the HOD.

101
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,172
Can we leave now?

102
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,474
Open your mouth please.

103
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,075
Okay!

104
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:16,981
So this looks like a case
of mild chronic bronchitis.

105
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,826
Now if you observe closely...
bronchitis is often...

106
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,329
...indicated by an expectorating
cough.

107
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,023
Now as you have studied earlier on...

108
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,232
...physical examination
often reveal...

109
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:29,563
Your mom?
Yes.

110
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:32,201
...decrease intensity
of breath sounds...

111
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:34,900
Very serious problem.
What?

112
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,033
Yeah.

113
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,441
Most doctors rely on
the presence of...

114
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,106
Stress related.

115
00:09:40,847 --> 00:09:42,109
Stress?
Yeah.

116
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,852
The woman who has such
a beautiful daughter...

117
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,854
...and that beautiful daughter
has a defect in the heart...

118
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,913
...then the mother is bound
to be stressed.

119
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,090
This was a compliment.
Not diagnosis.

120
00:09:56,997 --> 00:10:02,526
I understood this. But I didn't
understand the meaning of defect.

121
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:06,138
It means black hole.

122
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,930
There is a pain in your heart.

123
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,935
But why? You don't know that.

124
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:16,472
There is loneliness in your heart.

125
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,612
Why? You don't know that.

126
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,149
You are waiting for somebody.

127
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,585
But who? You don't know that.

128
00:10:28,028 --> 00:10:29,086
Dr. Katil!

129
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:30,487
Yes, sir!

130
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,020
The patient is here!
Of course, sir!

131
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,224
Please dial 118.

132
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,631
"It's time to get away."

133
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:41,133
"Time to go on and excavate."

134
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:43,141
"Yes, we'll have a good time."

135
00:10:43,343 --> 00:10:44,401
Rahul!

136
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,035
"It's time to learn."

137
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,137
Who is debuting
in our campus with Jyoti?

138
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:51,575
Who cares, man?

139
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,045
What is this?

140
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,985
This... it's a PSP, man!

141
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,254
Dad sent it for me through Dr. Suri.

142
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:04,057
Does it have the option of
selecting character's clothes?

143
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:10,063
At least spare
animated characters.

144
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:11,995
Okay!

145
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,571
Silicon!

146
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,610
You are just jealous!

147
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,483
What would you know
about it? Trust me!

148
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,190
Yeah, you are right!
Those can't be real!

149
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,024
Any other first year student?
Worth seducing?

150
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,628
I have heard there is a
jackpot in first year.

151
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,297
Curly hair. Rich.

152
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,432
Anaita.

153
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,201
I don't know her name.

154
00:11:51,578 --> 00:11:53,045
Hi!
Hi!

155
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,171
She?

156
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:58,240
No! But will do.

157
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,010
l think she has a good figure.

158
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,418
On second thoughts... she is hot!

159
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,183
Will you introduce me to her?

160
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,862
No! I can't take that risk!

161
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,896
And you call yourself my friend?

162
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,991
I used to. Till last year.

163
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,125
I had introduced you to her too.

164
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:17,269
In half an hour you asked
her, her breast size.

165
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,861
She still doesn't talk to me.

166
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,272
That was a misunderstanding, guys!

167
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:28,007
That question was asked in
a physiological context.

168
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,946
Buzz off, Bhagani! In your eyes...

169
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:31,410
How did Shahrukh Khan put it?

170
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,042
There is so much of lust.

171
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:34,882
Even if you recite the nursery
rhymes to the teacher...

172
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,319
...it will look as
if you are flirting with her.

173
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,948
You know, you are not a friend.

174
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:42,919
Yes, Anjali... Fine...

175
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,289
What happened?

176
00:12:46,132 --> 00:12:48,032
Today you didn't come on rounds
to meet poor patients.

177
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,362
Nothing!

178
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,969
Hole you girls had a good time!
Yeah, we had!

179
00:12:56,042 --> 00:12:57,304
You too?
Yeah! Of course!

180
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:58,969
Okay! I will see you soon!
Bye bye! See you!

181
00:12:59,245 --> 00:13:00,269
Bye!

182
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:01,472
Bye!
You too, baby! Bye!

183
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,417
Who is she? Sum total 96.

184
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,244
Freshers! Come!

185
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,084
Man, how do you get fresh
with these freshers?

186
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:11,214
I told you!

187
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,349
Read the sexual key to women.

188
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,483
Everything will be fine.

189
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,884
Hi, folks.

190
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:20,331
What's the matter? Why
is everybody so quiet?

191
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,460
What happened?

192
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:25,603
Is somebody starving in Ethiopia?

193
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,264
Shut up, Rahul!

194
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:29,431
So why are you so quiet today?

195
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:32,273
Hey, is it that time of the month?

196
00:13:32,946 --> 00:13:34,413
Get lost!

197
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,608
You guys are disgusting!
I will get some coffee.

198
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,010
Guys, I need to tell you something.

199
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:44,190
You guys will have to help Pepsi.

200
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,283
Pepsi is pregnant.

201
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:47,917
What!

202
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:58,631
What! It's not mine!

203
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:01,097
Not mine too!

204
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,836
Unless by fantasizing about
a woman she gets pregnant...

205
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,310
...then I don't know.

206
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,437
You are sick!

207
00:14:07,914 --> 00:14:10,906
You fantasize about your friend!
I am ashamed of you!

208
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,577
You should be! You too
come in my fantasies!

209
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:21,483
But you do it with Priyanka.
You ignore me at that time.

210
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,259
But I don't mind watching.
I am cool.

211
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:30,161
Guys! You guys never take
anything seriously.

212
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,368
She needs our help.

213
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:36,602
And the one who made her pregnant...
he will watch the show.

214
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,944
Rahul, she will listen to you!

215
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:41,378
She wants to keep the child!
Tell her it's not so easy!

216
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:44,473
Vishaka! I don't want
to get involved!

217
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,885
Okay, guys! This is serious!

218
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,883
Yeah, man! At such a young age...

219
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:52,891
...somebody will call me uncle.

220
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:54,916
She is coming! Talk to her, Rahul!

221
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:04,533
What happened? Why are
you all so serious?

222
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,307
Pepsi... do one thing.

223
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,908
Color pregnancy test
is not so reliable.

224
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,311
Do one thing. Go for beta XCG.

225
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,411
Oh! So you revealed it!

226
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,318
It would have been better if you
had written it on the notice board!

227
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:26,215
Pepsi, they are our friends.
I just wanted them to help.

228
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,293
Okay! So help!

229
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:30,954
Hell!

230
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:50,539
Well, I think Priyanka
is a matured adult.

231
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,350
And she knows what she should do.

232
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:56,212
So let her decide.

233
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,617
That's so typically Rahul!

234
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,122
It's somebody else's problem.
Why will you interfere?

235
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,331
Your mess. You clean it up, right?

236
00:16:07,901 --> 00:16:08,959
Hey, Pepsi! What is your problem?

237
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:14,567
I was respecting your choice
and your individuality!

238
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,167
But if you want me to
make decision for you...

239
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,301
...then I will do it!

240
00:16:18,912 --> 00:16:20,846
No need! I thought...

241
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,448
Okay! Chill!

242
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,285
I need some time to think.

243
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:29,446
Need time to think!
Babes!

244
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,580
Don't you babes me!

245
00:16:37,897 --> 00:16:40,593
Look at this! This is like a scar.

246
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:47,098
I don't know why I am frequently
getting infections.

247
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,602
See, I have got all the symptoms.

248
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:53,269
Look at this. See. This
is like a ring.

249
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,472
See the slot.

250
00:16:56,215 --> 00:16:59,082
Do you also think or am I
the only one feeling so?

251
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:02,479
It's OCP.

252
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,420
Obsessive compulsive psychosis.

253
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:06,390
Don't you know? Second
year students get it.

254
00:17:06,459 --> 00:17:07,824
Reading about the diseases
they feel...

255
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,555
...they have all the diseases.

256
00:17:09,629 --> 00:17:12,120
No, darling. I am not exaggerating.

257
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:18,233
See, now I feel heresies.

258
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,169
Yes, Vishaka!

259
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,440
Babes, where are you?
Will you please come to college?

260
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:30,907
Why?

261
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:34,585
Your beta XCG report has arrived.

262
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,315
What is written?

263
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:43,886
Babes, you just come here.
Don't get stressed.

264
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:45,954
We can work it all out.
You just come.

265
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,564
If it's positive, then it's the
end of the world, Mother T.

266
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,929
Babes, please. Don't do anything.

267
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:56,202
Please. Don't be tense.
Come straight here. Okay.

268
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:57,333
l will come.

269
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:01,176
l will come. Meaning you
are leaving. What?

270
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,315
Yes. Not just for now, but forever.

271
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:06,079
Don't ever come near me again.

272
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,881
You jerk! We are through!

273
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,820
Look, you all know that health
ministry is putting...

274
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:22,892
...a lot of pressure to send students
on compulsory medical service.

275
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:27,432
Although it's not mandatory for
private colleges like ours.

276
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:31,841
Still our board has decided that
starting from this year...

277
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:36,905
...for a month rural service
should be introduced.

278
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,284
Silence! Silence!

279
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,254
Silence! Silence!

280
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,256
Hey, students! Behave yourselves!

281
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:52,853
If you don't keep quiet
within 10 seconds...

282
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,924
...then I will have to
take stern action.

283
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,527
Silence!

284
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,496
Stern!

285
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,039
Keel quiet! Please!

286
00:19:01,107 --> 00:19:03,541
Quiet! Calm down!

287
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:06,401
Hi, Dr. Suri! How are you doing,
sir? Very well!

288
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,175
Dad was mentioning that is...
Silence!

289
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,306
He was really being kind.

290
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,441
Just remind him next time
you speak to him.

291
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,280
Yes, I will remind him.
Thanks, dear. Silence! Okay!

292
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,410
Come home.
Silence!

293
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,545
Take care!
Sure, sir!

294
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,813
Look, it has been decided
that final year student...

295
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:22,554
...will go for rural service.

296
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,530
Why are they hooting?

297
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,029
One month! That too in village!

298
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:34,130
Right!

299
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:36,167
You will say that!

300
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,838
For the farmer going back to
village is like a vacation.

301
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:40,970
Quiet!
Farmer!

302
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:46,577
Rahul... we can opt for Goa.
That too is a village.

303
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:48,912
True!

304
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:53,982
Yes! There will be damsels
in that village!

305
00:19:55,061 --> 00:19:58,462
Persian! Dutch! Irish!

306
00:20:00,466 --> 00:20:04,596
And I am ready to physically
examine those foreigners.

307
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,434
Here. Now examine this.

308
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,000
Mother T!

309
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,036
Do the examination!

310
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,545
Now she has started interrupting
my imagination too!

311
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:19,440
Hello! What?

312
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:28,484
Babes!

313
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,458
You are pregnant!

314
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,635
You are a pessimist and a fool too!

315
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,302
What?

316
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:48,074
My blood group is not B positive!

317
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,978
It's my blood group! It
means I am pregnant?

318
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:56,213
I was never pregnant! I was
just fooling you guys!

319
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,314
It means...

320
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,483
And this report?

321
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,186
It's for 100 rupees. Do you want it?

322
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,598
It's not funny!

323
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:18,875
How can you play with somebody's
emotion like this!

324
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,003
Emotion!

325
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,413
Did you guys see her face?

326
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,547
In anger, from Mother T
she became Mother Kali!

327
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:33,148
I felt she would lick up
a forceps and kill Pepsi!

328
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,018
But I feel bad for her.

329
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:36,422
Poor girl was really worried.

330
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,230
If she is worried for
Pepsi then it's fine.

331
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:42,201
But along with that she is worried
for the entire humanity.

332
00:21:43,236 --> 00:21:44,965
l mean what
a waste of family money!

333
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,363
Do you know how rich she is?

334
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:50,903
If you auction all
her clothes then...

335
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:53,468
...with that money Ram Gopal Verma
can make 24 more Sholays.

336
00:21:54,247 --> 00:21:55,339
And he will again set them ablaze!

337
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,640
Only when Pepsi
lets him auction them!

338
00:21:59,252 --> 00:22:01,152
Pepsi wears all of
Mother T's dresses.

339
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:03,854
Her supply comes from
the Khadi (coarse cotton) market.

340
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,248
Guys, imagine!

341
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:07,859
If there is a strike
in the Khadi market...

342
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,555
...then Mother T will be
doing a full monty.

343
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:13,228
Don't say that! She is a nice girl!

344
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,391
That's the problem.

345
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:20,599
Scoundrel! Who allows them in!

346
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,265
Actually what stupid people!

347
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,033
Nonsense!
Where the heck is the watchman!

348
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,168
I don't know!

349
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,276
Hello! Hi! Neha!

350
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:34,152
I thought I will be
alone till the end!

351
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,450
But look at this. The end is here.

352
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:38,622
You made me wait for so long!

353
00:22:39,492 --> 00:22:40,618
Who is this Neha?

354
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,492
She had come at the OPD for
her mother's treatment.

355
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:49,023
But I think he has started
her daughter's treatment.

356
00:22:49,235 --> 00:22:50,293
Where were you?

357
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:52,903
Of course, I was waiting
for your call.

358
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:56,301
Man, this guy is damn smooth!

359
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,637
He doesn't spare anybody!

360
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:02,576
Boss... give me a few tips too.

361
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:08,250
Make me have had from have
not. It's too much.

362
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,586
Shall I give you a secret tip?
Yes.

363
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,452
Don't give them too much attention.

364
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,289
Don't pay attention.

365
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,533
Girls will themselves get enticed.

366
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,863
You say don't give them attention.

367
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,370
Kats says give them attention.

368
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:31,000
Hi!
Hi!

369
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:35,038
Come on! Don't do this!

370
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,547
Who is it?
Pepsi!

371
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,248
Go away! I hate you!

372
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,021
Vishaka! I never said
that I am pregnant!

373
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,888
You planted the seed of
doubt in your mind.

374
00:23:47,226 --> 00:23:49,126
And you brought the
pregnancy kit for me.

375
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:50,895
I played along to
prove to you that...

376
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,921
...people believe what
they want to believe!

377
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:13,376
I am sorry!

378
00:24:18,424 --> 00:24:19,482
Sorry!

379
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,554
You know, you are right!

380
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,364
People believe what
they want to believe!

381
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,864
And I believe none of your
relationships work out...

382
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,426
...because in it there are
three people and not two.

383
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:35,397
One you, second that guy
and the third Rahul!

384
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,310
Mother T, you don't know anything!

385
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,139
I have already forgotten Rahul.

386
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:45,274
Yeah?

387
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,882
Everybody thought that
you played this prank...

388
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,581
...of pregnancy to fool me.

389
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,890
But I know you played this
drama for somebody else...

390
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:54,482
...and not for me.

391
00:24:57,196 --> 00:24:58,527
You got love from Rahul.

392
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,228
What you didn't get was commitment.

393
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,268
Because for Rahul love and
commitment are two different things.

394
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:07,362
l really feel bad for you,
babes. Really bad!

395
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,408
Don't you 'babes' me! Okay!

396
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:15,844
You are not fooling anybody else.

397
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:16,973
You are fooling only yourself!

398
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:46,002
"Your talks gradually
entice my heart."

399
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:50,342
"My heart sways with
your fragrance."

400
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,216
"When the rain drops
dampen my veil."

401
00:25:55,287 --> 00:25:59,621
"Only you fill my breath
with fragrance."

402
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,858
"When I wish to touch you
I cannot touch you."

403
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,229
"You are hidden in my dreams."

404
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,896
"Beloved."

405
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:17,575
"This light of your eyes."

406
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,108
"Beloved."

407
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:27,910
"This light of your love."

408
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:41,599
"When your heartbeats unite
with my heartbeats."

409
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,597
"All the tints of the sky fade."

410
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:51,102
"Your fingers touch my body."

411
00:26:51,176 --> 00:26:55,613
"Like dew drops on flowers."

412
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:59,884
"Intoxication shrouds the heart."

413
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:08,557
"Beloved."

414
00:27:09,161 --> 00:27:13,427
"This light of your eyes."

415
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:18,027
"Beloved."

416
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:23,564
"This light of your love."

417
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:28,510
"Beloved. Beloved."

418
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:40,381
"Beloved. Beloved."

419
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:05,412
"Your words gradually
entice my heart."

420
00:28:05,884 --> 00:28:09,285
"My heart sways with
your fragrance."

421
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:13,849
"Beloved."

422
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,528
"This light of your eyes."

423
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:23,097
"Beloved."

424
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:28,902
"This light of your love."

425
00:29:06,145 --> 00:29:10,548
"Your words gradually
entice my heart."

426
00:29:10,883 --> 00:29:14,410
"My heart sways with
your fragrance."

427
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:18,980
"Beloved."

428
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:23,853
"This light of your eyes."

429
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,229
"Beloved."

430
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:34,068
"This light of your love."

431
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,571
"Beloved. Beloved."

432
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:57,358
Guys! Your attention please!

433
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:58,887
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

434
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,228
Let me introduce Prakash!
Hi!

435
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,858
In the coming election Prakash...

436
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:05,096
...is standing as an independent
candidate.

437
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:07,565
That day in the campus it was
not his guest appearance.

438
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,068
He has a full fledged
role in the college.

439
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:12,503
Yes, romantic lead. Opposite Jyoti.

440
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,374
He is her boyfriend. Hi, guys.

441
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:16,876
I am Prakash Dube!

442
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:19,013
M. Tech. Mahatma Gandhi University!

443
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:21,885
I want to focus your
attention on some...

444
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,251
...major problems of the university.

445
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,390
Here there are only
5 private colleges.

446
00:30:27,092 --> 00:30:29,890
But today, the number
of voters are 5000!

447
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,224
You guys are sitting
on a huge weapon.

448
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,899
On the basis of 5000
votes you people...

449
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:37,333
...can change this university!

450
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,130
And make it better!

451
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,900
Boss... what is there to change?

452
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,898
Unless you want to ban exams.

453
00:30:46,612 --> 00:30:48,978
Or the food.

454
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,911
Brother, it's good the way it is.

455
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:53,342
Is it?

456
00:30:54,052 --> 00:30:55,451
Do you know how unsafe
the university...

457
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,386
...has become for girls at night?
No problem.

458
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:00,353
We will explain to Bhagani not
to venture out during nights.

459
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,585
I didn't do anything.

460
00:31:03,162 --> 00:31:05,187
I don't know your inside jokes.

461
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:11,529
But I do know that here guys roam
in cars and bikes at night.

462
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,196
They tease girls.

463
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,031
Drugs are being sold
openly in the campus.

464
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:18,604
Really? Where?

465
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:23,443
What are you saying? Boss...
10 grams of drugs for me also.

466
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:28,611
Nobody knows where the student
aid funds' money went.

467
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:31,552
Whereas this fund has been started
to help needy students.

468
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,017
Sir, money can't help
needy students.

469
00:31:36,295 --> 00:31:40,095
I have money. But sir,
I am still needy.

470
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:43,261
Do you have something in your
manifesto for that need?

471
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:48,629
Prakash! We don't need anything!

472
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,508
You must have realised that.

473
00:31:52,444 --> 00:31:55,277
Now what do you want? Tell us that.

474
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:02,979
Listen, guys. No body or party
will support me and my issues.

475
00:32:03,856 --> 00:32:05,255
And I don't need their support.

476
00:32:06,525 --> 00:32:08,857
If I can make you interested
in these issues...

477
00:32:08,894 --> 00:32:13,854
...then nobody can stop us from
changing this university.

478
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,990
What's your problem?

479
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,359
Take the donation and leave!

480
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,898
I don't want donation! I want
support for our basic rights!

481
00:32:23,876 --> 00:32:26,538
Already capitation fee is
charged in our college.

482
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,871
Still under some excuse
or the other...

483
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,211
...the whole year's money is
taken from the student.

484
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,443
Come on, man!

485
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:38,015
If anybody had any problem,
then he would have protested.

486
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:40,522
You are trying to find some
issue when there is none!

487
00:32:41,026 --> 00:32:43,494
And you want to deliberately
involve us in politics.

488
00:32:43,595 --> 00:32:47,588
Why? When we don't want politics!

489
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:49,497
You will have to make
a beginning someday.

490
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,630
Come on, man! We want no politics!

491
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,035
With vote or without!

492
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,234
Yeah, dude! We want no politics!

493
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:00,934
We want no politics!
We want no politics!

494
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:04,549
We want no politics!
We want no politics!

495
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,149
We want no politics!
We want no politics!

496
00:33:08,287 --> 00:33:10,847
We want no politics!
We want no politics!

497
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:14,290
We want no politics!
We want no politics!

498
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:18,054
We want no politics!

499
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,892
We want no politics!

500
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:24,362
You have so many needs!
Our needy student! Needy!

501
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:29,374
Haves! Have-nots!

502
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:31,200
Hello, mom!

503
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,971
How are you, son?
Sorry! You...

504
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,870
Greetings. What's up?

505
00:33:35,948 --> 00:33:38,348
Greetings, son! Just getting
my pedicure done!

506
00:33:38,617 --> 00:33:39,982
Wow!
Reform!

507
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:42,111
Mom, don't place your
feet on the ground.

508
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:44,178
They will become dirty.

509
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:47,025
Hi, aunt. You didn't send wine.

510
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,284
Did you hear? It's Rahul!
I want one.

511
00:33:49,995 --> 00:33:51,394
Yes! Rahul!

512
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:53,589
Tell him that I will
send it soon. Okay!

513
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:55,257
Oops!
Sorry, ma'am! Slowly!

514
00:33:55,334 --> 00:33:57,268
What happened, mom?
Nothing, son! Nothing!

515
00:33:57,336 --> 00:33:58,462
Just chilled the toe nail.

516
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:02,237
But son, there are graver
problems here.

517
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:04,399
Workers have gone on a strike.

518
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:08,438
Oh! But I spoke to dad.
He didn't say anything.

519
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,048
Everything started 2 days ago.

520
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:13,541
Some workers had come to work drunk.

521
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:17,583
Your father fired them.
And the problem started.

522
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:21,484
That's sad! But don't
you worry, mom.

523
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,084
Everything will be fine.

524
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:25,559
And yes, I will talk
to dad at night.

525
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:30,228
Yes, son. Please talk to him.
He seems to be pretty tense.

526
00:34:30,335 --> 00:34:34,101
Okay. It's his call. Son,
l will call you later.

527
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,867
Greetings, son.
Bye, mom.

528
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,576
Posters will be put up, Jyoti.
But I am thinking.

529
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,347
You have got it ready.
And the posters...

530
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,476
Listen, don't worry.

531
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,951
Our biggest strength is that we
believe in what we are doing.

532
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,488
Okay!
Right! You can do it!

533
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,115
Go for it!

534
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:54,916
Excuse me!

535
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:57,586
You think you are too cool!

536
00:34:58,497 --> 00:35:04,197
Me? I don't think I am cool!
I know I am cool!

537
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,067
He has got such a bloated
ego! Seriously!

538
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,903
Jyoti! Chill! Chill! It's okay!

539
00:35:10,175 --> 00:35:12,268
He won't reform! Come on!
Hey!

540
00:35:13,378 --> 00:35:14,504
Say it on my face!

541
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,307
Just forget it! Okay!
You were talking too much there!

542
00:35:24,356 --> 00:35:25,414
Will you be able to understand?

543
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,854
People who go from AC
room to AC library...

544
00:35:28,894 --> 00:35:31,158
...they can't understand
normal students' problem.

545
00:35:31,463 --> 00:35:36,127
Brother... I have been born rich.
So what's my fault?

546
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:41,429
But my understanding is quite
evolved. You can give it a try.

547
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,466
l seriously doubt it.

548
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,477
Along with being rich you are
reckless and insensitive too.

549
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:51,109
l would rather use
the word carefree.

550
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:55,316
Mess, canteen... Clinton is
everywhere in the campus, Rahul.

551
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,046
Do you know what your problem is?
What?

552
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:02,256
You people mock everything
to hide your flaws.

553
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:04,056
So that you don't have to do it.

554
00:36:04,863 --> 00:36:06,831
Because you very well know that...

555
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:08,092
...you people can't do anything.

556
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,162
There is nothing which I can't do.

557
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,132
You can't unite people like me.

558
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:19,103
You can't make them
believe in something.

559
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:22,913
Dude, twice you have said 'can't do.'

560
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,074
Now I won't say anything.

561
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:32,389
l will do it.
Really! What will you do?

562
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:34,357
You will crack two more jokes?

563
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,085
How many people are with you?

564
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:39,863
You can't even imagine it!

565
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:44,392
Number! Come on! Give me a number!
And I will double it!

566
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:49,965
Prakash... you didn't make any
mistake by joining politics.

567
00:36:52,277 --> 00:36:54,939
But you made a mistake
by challenging Rahul.

568
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,881
In this election I will gain
more support than you.

569
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:01,476
Hey...

570
00:37:02,487 --> 00:37:03,954
You have accepted the
challenge, Rahul.

571
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,151
But it's easier said than done.

572
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,820
l have got what they
call beginner's luck.

573
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:11,452
Actually it's a touch.

574
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:19,035
Trust me. You won't
win the elections.

575
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:22,264
See you, brother.

576
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,438
Dude, you are not serious, are you?

577
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,938
Didn't you hear?
Hey!

578
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:33,075
I am dead serious!

579
00:37:44,496 --> 00:37:48,227
Friends... today is a historic day.

580
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,198
Many parties have been held in KMC.

581
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:57,102
Pajama! Rave! Stag!

582
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,208
But not a political party!

583
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,138
Now it will happen!

584
00:38:03,548 --> 00:38:06,540
And it's called Stud!

585
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,824
Usually I am the bartender
in parties.

586
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:21,890
But in this case...
I am the president.

587
00:38:24,169 --> 00:38:28,105
You must be wondering... Rahul
and interested in politics.

588
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,099
Right!

589
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:33,407
I am not!
Yo, man!

590
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:36,845
My and my party's interest
is in getting rid of...

591
00:38:36,915 --> 00:38:40,510
...all the political
parties who bore us.

592
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,452
We are not scared of politics.
We are just allergic to it.

593
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:50,356
So if you hate politics... if you
are a stud... and you are cool...

594
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:52,054
...then vote for us.

595
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,390
Studs!

596
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,261
So here is the party for you guys!

597
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,270
Please welcome on stage... Gaurav!

598
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,272
"I just want to fly!"

599
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:08,909
"I have zest, passion and guts."

600
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:12,914
"It's my life. It's my world!"

601
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,474
"I have high aims."

602
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,411
"I don't give a damn."

603
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,482
"It's my life. It's my world!"

604
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:20,421
"I don't give a damn."

605
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:24,053
"I have zest, passion and guts."

606
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:28,197
"It's my life. It's my world!"

607
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:29,995
"I have high aims."

608
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,863
"I don't give a damn."

609
00:39:32,137 --> 00:39:33,934
"It's my life. It's my world!"

610
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:35,063
"I don't give a damn."

611
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,971
"I just want to fly!"

612
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:40,834
"Into the sky!"

613
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,981
"The blue sky is my world."

614
00:39:46,451 --> 00:39:48,351
"I just want to fly!"

615
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:10,103
"I do whatever I want."

616
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:13,607
"I am fearless."

617
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,878
"I choose my destiny."

618
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:21,179
"The world is with me."

619
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,618
"I will take the sun along."

620
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:33,293
"I have this belief."

621
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,493
"I just want to fly!"

622
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,262
"Into the sky!"

623
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:47,509
"The blue sky is my world."

624
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:49,910
"I just want to fly!"

625
00:41:22,547 --> 00:41:24,344
"I just want to fly!"

626
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:28,210
Stick it properly. There. Yes.

627
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:30,947
Imran, up! Yes!

628
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,422
Doctor is there. Everything
will be done.

629
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:37,121
Dr. Anna...
Yes.

630
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:40,263
Tell me something. What
kind of doctor are you?

631
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,490
I am a friends' doctor.

632
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,358
What do you mean?

633
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:44,902
I have been with the doctors
studying in this college...

634
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,095
...since my childhood.

635
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,570
l have been in specialists' company.

636
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,903
So I ...
You became a doctor. Yes!

637
00:41:57,415 --> 00:41:58,473
Hey!

638
00:42:06,458 --> 00:42:08,187
Run! Run!

639
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,552
Run!

640
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:16,123
Hell! Hell!

641
00:42:17,035 --> 00:42:18,093
Hell!

642
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:22,503
Bhagani! Hell!

643
00:42:28,146 --> 00:42:31,138
Rahul! Bhagani! Hell!

644
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,417
I don't know! I have never
seen them before!

645
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,249
But obviously they
are Prakash's men.

646
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:39,480
We will have to wait until Dr.
Anna regains consciousness.

647
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,017
He must have recognized them.

648
00:42:41,092 --> 00:42:42,389
Where is he?
He is here!

649
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,427
In here?
Yes. Here!

650
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,311
We will shift Dr. Anna to
our college's hospital.

651
00:43:25,870 --> 00:43:27,030
Sister.
Yes.

652
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,163
Take care.
Sure, sir.

653
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,297
Come on, guys!

654
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,101
Everything was fine till now.

655
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:35,869
But now we will have to seriously
think about Prakash.

656
00:43:43,988 --> 00:43:45,046
Hi!

657
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,548
Why did you beat my men!

658
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:49,293
What?
Why?

659
00:43:50,895 --> 00:43:52,385
What nonsense!
Why did you beat my men!

660
00:43:53,197 --> 00:43:55,131
Rahul! Get real! Okay!

661
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,298
My friends are not interested
in these things.

662
00:43:58,503 --> 00:44:00,164
And we don't have any
money for such things.

663
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,834
Seeing the popularity
of your Studs maybe...

664
00:44:02,907 --> 00:44:05,239
...the college's mainstream political
parties have started taking action.

665
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:10,280
Mainstream political parties?
What is that?

666
00:44:11,516 --> 00:44:14,178
Welcome to the big, bad world of
student's politics, my dear friend!

667
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:16,251
Now if you want to defeat me...

668
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,152
...then you will have
to endure all this.

669
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:20,181
Now excuse me!

670
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,892
Dr. Rashmi, you have a visitor
in the main lobby.

671
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:26,357
Dr. Rashmi, you have a visitor
in the main lobby.

672
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,459
Come on! How did all this happen?

673
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,868
She fell
down from the balcony at night?

674
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:35,869
Actually...
What?

675
00:44:37,075 --> 00:44:43,207
We had a fight. We... broke up.
What!

676
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:49,509
So you think she...
l ... I think so, brother.

677
00:44:50,555 --> 00:44:51,613
I think so. Come on.

678
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:01,523
This is bad news, mate.

679
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,558
I think you shouldn't tell
anybody about this.

680
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:10,840
Because if the students find out
that this is a suicide attempt...

681
00:45:10,908 --> 00:45:13,376
...then our chances
will not be bright.

682
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,173
What did I know that
she will do this?

683
00:45:20,952 --> 00:45:22,010
Excuse me, sir.

684
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,918
First explain to him politely.
Okay.

685
00:45:57,989 --> 00:45:59,149
If he agrees, fine.

686
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:03,018
Otherwise kill him.
Fine.

687
00:46:15,073 --> 00:46:16,131
Why did you beat my men?

688
00:46:17,008 --> 00:46:18,134
If we had not beaten them then...

689
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:19,267
...you wouldn't
have come to meet us.

690
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:28,318
What will you have? Beer
or something hard?

691
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:30,912
What?

692
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,853
Look, if we had enmity with you...

693
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:35,859
...then we would have beaten you.
We beat your men.

694
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:38,895
l just wanted
to give you a friendly advice.

695
00:46:39,497 --> 00:46:42,557
Look, forget the elections.

696
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:46,401
It's not for guys belonging
to decent families.

697
00:46:46,871 --> 00:46:47,929
Prakash too...

698
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,298
I am telling you.

699
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,271
A man like Prakash stands
in every election.

700
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:57,878
How much will I tolerate two men...

701
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:59,007
...who takes away my votes, brother?

702
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:08,819
What if I withdraw from
the elections...

703
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,122
...after taking away Prakash's votes?

704
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,853
Then we will become friends.

705
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:16,890
But how will you stop him?

706
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:27,202
I have got something against him.

707
00:47:27,545 --> 00:47:30,207
Is that so? We didn't
get hold of anything.

708
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:31,906
And you found something.

709
00:47:32,984 --> 00:47:34,042
Beginner's luck.

710
00:48:01,813 --> 00:48:03,906
Go! Inside! Yes!

711
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,832
Dude, are you sure this
is going to work?

712
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:28,298
Now if it's a suicide... then there
should be a suicide note.

713
00:48:45,857 --> 00:48:47,188
Excuse me! Excuse me!

714
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,284
How did you people enter the
campus? Who called you?

715
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:51,555
I was coming to meet you.

716
00:48:52,196 --> 00:48:53,857
You have admitted a suicide case.

717
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,296
And you didn't inform the police.

718
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:57,228
What nonsense! This is not true!

719
00:48:58,269 --> 00:49:00,863
A girl fell down from
the balcony at night.

720
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,235
That's it! It was an accident!

721
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:04,171
So Jyoti Rajaram didn't
commit suicide?

722
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,801
We have got the information that...

723
00:49:07,879 --> 00:49:09,813
...her boyfriend Prakash
used to harass her a lot.

724
00:49:10,248 --> 00:49:13,513
Let it be. We want to search
her room in girl's hostel.

725
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:14,876
Will you tell me where it is?

726
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,183
No! She fell down! That's it!

727
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:21,218
It will be better if you
let us decide that!

728
00:49:33,571 --> 00:49:35,471
Found anything?
No, sir! Nothing!

729
00:49:53,858 --> 00:49:56,292
Will you still say that she
fell down from the balcony?

730
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:01,063
O no! This really looks
like her handwriting!

731
00:50:04,936 --> 00:50:05,994
Very sad!

732
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,304
Excuse me! Side please! Side!

733
00:50:17,882 --> 00:50:18,940
Come on! Inspector!

734
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,313
Inspector!
What nonsense is this!

735
00:50:20,484 --> 00:50:21,951
At least take Jyoti's statement!

736
00:50:22,086 --> 00:50:23,951
We will take the statement when she
is be able to give one. Come on!

737
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,251
Inspector, I didn't do anything!
Believe me! Sir...

738
00:50:26,324 --> 00:50:27,586
Listen to him!
You keep quiet!

739
00:50:27,892 --> 00:50:29,291
Sir, you can't arrest him without...

740
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:30,487
...taking Jyoti's statement!
Sir, please! Quiet!

741
00:50:30,594 --> 00:50:32,027
Sir, I didn't do anything!
Please, sir! Come on!

742
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:34,257
On what basis are you arresting me?

743
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:35,556
Look! Sir!

744
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:38,493
Inspector, this is illegal!
You can't do this!

745
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:40,127
Get in! Then I will teach you law!

746
00:50:45,343 --> 00:50:47,174
What happened?
Nothing!

747
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,007
Girls are not safe in the campus!

748
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,645
Isn't this what that leader
said? Now watch this!

749
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:55,385
He led his girlfriend to the
hospital and where is he going now?

750
00:50:55,586 --> 00:50:58,316
Campus is safer without him.
Right!

751
00:51:00,558 --> 00:51:05,962
Vote for Rahul! Vote for Rahul!
Vote for Rahul!

752
00:51:05,997 --> 00:51:10,593
Vote for Rahul! Vote for Rahul!
Vote for Rahul!

753
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:15,037
Vote for Rahul! Vote for Rahul!
Vote for Rahul!

754
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:19,338
Vote for Rahul! Vote for Rahul!
Vote for Rahul!

755
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:23,972
Vote for Rahul! Vote for Rahul!
Vote for Rahul!

756
00:51:24,048 --> 00:51:28,348
Vote for Rahul! Vote for Rahul!
Vote for Rahul!

757
00:51:28,419 --> 00:51:32,480
Vote for Rahul! Vote for Rahul!
Vote for Rahul!

758
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:39,519
Vote for Rahul! Rahul!
Rahul! Rahul! Rahul!

759
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:45,267
Rahul! Rahul! Rahul! Rahul!

760
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:52,907
Rahul! Rahul! Rahul! Rahul!

761
00:51:53,644 --> 00:51:58,911
Hats off to you! But remember
your promise!

762
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:02,852
Otherwise I will come with
all my men to remind you.

763
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,158
You had promised everybody, right?

764
00:52:12,563 --> 00:52:15,054
That you will fight against
typical campus politicians.

765
00:52:16,167 --> 00:52:17,395
And now you are going to withdraw.

766
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:20,470
You always let everybody down.

767
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,405
Pepsi, he will have to withdraw.

768
00:52:22,873 --> 00:52:25,865
Otherwise that Mani will make
another deadly entry.

769
00:52:27,011 --> 00:52:30,003
It will be a horrible way
to lose my virginity, guys!

770
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:32,609
You people actually made
a deal with those goons?

771
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:34,942
You guys are mad!

772
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,179
T, we have not come here
to discuss our morality!

773
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,623
We are here to find the
solution of a problem.

774
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:42,022
This is not right, Katil!

775
00:52:42,126 --> 00:52:43,184
There is one solution.

776
00:52:50,434 --> 00:52:51,492
We will go away from here.

777
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:56,297
Where?

778
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:02,503
For rural service.

779
00:53:05,249 --> 00:53:06,511
We definitely have to
go sometime or the other.

780
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,243
So why not now?

781
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:15,382
We'll stay safe and won't
have to fight election too.

782
00:53:19,563 --> 00:53:21,053
And by the time we return...

783
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,526
...the locals would have
forgotten about the elections.

784
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:34,602
Is there any other way?

785
00:53:35,146 --> 00:53:40,277
There is. But Mani must be
standing on that way. Okay?

786
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,277
You know what will happen
with this action of yours?

787
00:53:43,354 --> 00:53:45,219
That hooligan party will win again.

788
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:47,014
What's new about that?

789
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:49,389
Anyway they win every year.

790
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,556
Butter... move it in.

791
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,462
Wretched escapists!

792
00:53:58,536 --> 00:53:59,901
I am not going to run
and go anywhere.

793
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:04,272
Vishakha...
Jatin... let her go, man.

794
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:08,902
But you are going to fight
a very important election.

795
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:12,577
Your new interest is
aroused in politics.

796
00:54:13,584 --> 00:54:17,452
Sir, you know how interested
I'm in things like this.

797
00:54:18,189 --> 00:54:19,247
It was just a joke.

798
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,381
Just another excuse
for a party or two.

799
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:25,054
But the students are
taking you seriously.

800
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:31,425
Sir, if the problem is so serious...

801
00:54:32,203 --> 00:54:33,602
...then I can talk to Dr. Suri.

802
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:37,135
No. No. I am not saying
that you can't go.

803
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:41,273
l just want to know the reasons.

804
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:45,547
By the way in which
area you do want to go?

805
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:47,516
Err... we...
Goa.

806
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:49,543
Goa?

807
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:52,252
There is no centre at Goa.

808
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,926
There is a centre near Goa.

809
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:01,830
Err... sure, sir. It
will do. That's good!

810
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:04,827
Good! The college will
make the arrangements.

811
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:08,331
When do you want to go?

812
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:13,103
Err... tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

813
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:16,946
Okay. Start lacking.
Great, sir.

814
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:18,838
Thanks, sir. Okay the car will
lick you up tomorrow morning...

815
00:55:18,916 --> 00:55:21,180
...and reach you to the centre. Okay?

816
00:55:21,252 --> 00:55:22,310
Thank you, sir.

817
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:24,854
And Rahul, don't forget
to take the Service...

818
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:27,288
...Completion certificate from
the centre in charge.

819
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:29,883
I want to see them.

820
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,393
Best of luck to you.
Thank you, sir.

821
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:43,530
Okay it's fine. At least you'll
stay peacefully for a month.

822
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:45,338
No one will bother you.

823
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,337
It is good for you too.

824
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:50,937
Even you'll get to live alone
with Rahul for one month.

825
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:30,848
Hey that's T.

826
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:34,086
Driver, stop.
Oh, oh!

827
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:40,588
Hi guys!

828
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,865
If no one troubles
me for one month...

829
00:56:44,935 --> 00:56:46,596
...then I might die.

830
00:56:50,207 --> 00:56:51,265
Tea, guys.

831
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:53,937
Mama T, welcome, welcome.

832
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:57,339
Just can't get free from Mama T.

833
00:56:59,283 --> 00:57:00,545
Welcome, welcome please.

834
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:06,447
Ooh!

835
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:08,950
Hey check out this.

836
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:10,050
What is this?

837
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:11,219
What the hell is happening?

838
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:13,126
Yeah. What is this?
Rahul and politics?

839
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:15,154
We should have never
trusted him, guys. Yes.

840
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,166
We guys have a blast right?
Yeah.

841
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:18,963
You don't know Rahul. Exactly.

842
00:57:20,371 --> 00:57:23,465
Let's go, pals. Boo!

843
00:57:57,141 --> 00:58:02,477
"Summer of 2007."

844
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:10,411
"Summer of 2007."

845
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:14,253
"Summer of 2007."

846
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,129
Why there is such
a silence, brother?

847
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:07,334
We will work here?

848
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,079
Okay we'll meet after one month.

849
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:32,226
'Oh God! Oh Panduranga! '

850
00:59:32,302 --> 00:59:33,462
'Come on! Walk faster. Walk soon.'

851
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:36,438
Oh God! Oh God!

852
00:59:36,507 --> 00:59:37,565
Hey what are you doing?

853
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:42,911
Oh Panduranga! Oh God!

854
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:47,144
Come on. Walk faster.
Oh Panduranga! Oh God!

855
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:50,919
Oh God! Oh Lord!
Oh Panduranga! Oh Panduranga!

856
00:59:50,988 --> 00:59:52,046
Hey come on!

857
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:53,180
Oh Panduranga! Oh Panduranga!

858
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:54,281
Come on. Make it fast!

859
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:55,449
Oh Panduranga! Oh Panduranga!

860
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:57,255
Oh God! Oh Lord!

861
00:59:57,294 --> 00:59:59,159
Hey Ramla, bring him fast.

862
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:02,357
Oh Panduranga! Oh Panduranga!
Oh Lord! Come on. Make it fast!

863
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:06,195
Yes this side. This side.

864
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:07,394
Bring him over here.

865
01:00:07,471 --> 01:00:08,529
Oh Panduranga! Oh Panduranga!
Oh God! Oh Lord!

866
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,163
Bring her here.
Hey wait! Wait!

867
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:13,869
Oh Panduranga! Oh Panduranga!
Oh God! Oh Lord!

868
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:17,471
Oh Panduranga! Oh Panduranga!

869
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:22,351
Oh God! Oh Lord!

870
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,082
The whole family
consumed the medicine...

871
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,284
...and tried to commit suicide.

872
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:31,087
Why? This is the condition
of every village.

873
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,286
The farmers are dying.

874
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:33,387
Come on, let's go.

875
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,023
Go and call the village chief
immediately.

876
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:37,157
I'll go and bring him soon.
Yes.

877
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:39,635
Mai... get up my child.

878
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,933
Make him lie down.
Mai.

879
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:45,432
It's terrible!

880
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:46,567
Hey open your eyes.

881
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:52,373
Come on, guys.

882
01:00:56,987 --> 01:01:00,445
Oh Panduranga! Oh Panduranga!

883
01:01:02,092 --> 01:01:05,357
Oh God! Oh Lord! Oh God!

884
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:08,590
Good grief! He is no more!

885
01:01:09,533 --> 01:01:13,867
Oh Panduranga! Oh Panduranga!

886
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:18,601
Oh God! Oh Lord!

887
01:01:24,081 --> 01:01:25,412
Don't allow me to go
to the toilet or take a bath.

888
01:01:26,283 --> 01:01:27,409
When I go to the toilet,
you call doctor.

889
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:29,144
When I go lee,
then you want a doctor.

890
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,211
Hey! Bring everyone inside.

891
01:01:32,289 --> 01:01:33,517
Hey come on, come inside soon.

892
01:01:33,624 --> 01:01:34,921
Bring them inside.

893
01:01:41,298 --> 01:01:42,356
Shucks!

894
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:45,034
Yes. Bring him. Make him lie here.

895
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:46,627
Be careful.

896
01:01:51,508 --> 01:01:52,941
Hey, send them out.
Yes, yes.

897
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:54,968
Hey come on, go out.

898
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:56,171
Go out. Go out.
What work do you have here?

899
01:01:56,313 --> 01:01:57,371
Come on. You also go out.

900
01:01:57,514 --> 01:01:58,640
Go out! Go out! Come on,
go out from here. Go out.

901
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:00,381
Get up. You get up from here.
Get up.

902
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:01,977
You go out. Go now. What work
do you have here? Go from here.

903
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:03,913
Let the doctor do his work.

904
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:05,452
Listen to me. Come on.

905
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:06,887
Everyone wait here outside.

906
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:08,251
Why are you crowding inside?

907
01:02:08,458 --> 01:02:09,891
What will the doctor be able
to do inside then?

908
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:11,253
Come on, you wait outside.
Come on. Come here.

909
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:14,596
Raghu, you examine him.
Yes sir.

910
01:02:16,933 --> 01:02:17,991
Shucks!

911
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,001
Yeah, open your mouth.
Open your mouth.

912
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,135
Excuse me.

913
01:02:29,146 --> 01:02:31,910
Excuse me. Doctor, at least
you should use gloves.

914
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,610
Open your mouth. Yes.

915
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,145
Vomit now.

916
01:02:39,289 --> 01:02:40,483
Attend him.
Yes sir.

917
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,035
Aunt, give me the syringe.

918
01:03:00,844 --> 01:03:01,902
Give now.

919
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:16,955
Raghu, give him glucose.
Yes, yes.

920
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:19,492
Aunt, give me the syringe.
Hurry up. Yes, yes, right now.

921
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,121
Here. Take this.

922
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,599
I was not able to save your
son and daughter-in-law.

923
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,475
But both those boys are saved.

924
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:39,472
Who can avoid what's written
in destiny, doctor?

925
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:42,412
I have delayed half of it.

926
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:45,480
You also do something.

927
01:03:46,223 --> 01:03:47,485
Or many things
are written in destiny.

928
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:49,617
Written in destiny! Huh!

929
01:03:50,494 --> 01:03:52,587
And both of them won't return
if you crowd here.

930
01:03:54,364 --> 01:03:56,355
After the police's work is over,
come and grieve.

931
01:03:57,634 --> 01:03:59,625
If anyone wants to die in future
then don't consume poison.

932
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:01,832
Sprinkle kerosene and burn yourself.

933
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:03,099
The money for the funeral
rites will be saved.

934
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,098
Go from here.

935
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:07,367
Go!

936
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:31,600
Myself Dr. Mukesh Jadhav.

937
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:33,060
Pleased to meet you.

938
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:37,001
We are Kasturba Medical
College students.

939
01:04:40,277 --> 01:04:41,335
So?

940
01:04:50,954 --> 01:04:55,118
Private college? Then we
are brothers. From quota.

941
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:58,117
Quota?
Yes.

942
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:01,159
I am OBC quota. You are ERI quota.

943
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:05,425
ERI quota? Extremely
Rich People, guys.

944
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:10,236
Excuse me, why did that
family attempt suicide?

945
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:11,965
I mean what problems did they have?

946
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:15,377
Tee, shall we solve our
problems first please.

947
01:05:18,448 --> 01:05:21,906
l see. So what problems do you have?

948
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:26,513
One minute.

949
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,559
Chief, where is Sankhya?

950
01:05:35,465 --> 01:05:36,591
What do I know?

951
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:40,127
Today is the 8th day
since he disappeared.

952
01:05:41,071 --> 01:05:42,402
The entire work will
be ruined, chief.

953
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,607
You all had his responsibility.

954
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:47,942
Why didn't you take
care of him then?

955
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:50,203
Hey who is that?

956
01:05:57,220 --> 01:05:59,279
So what problem do you all have?

957
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,555
Are you the sircumauthority here?

958
01:06:08,298 --> 01:06:12,234
Do you sign all the certificates
here? Yes.

959
01:06:14,371 --> 01:06:16,236
I am the only authority here.

960
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:19,835
Listen sir, we'll
need certificates...

961
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:21,969
...that we worked here for one month.

962
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:24,309
So will you give that to us?
But why?

963
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,574
We mean after working
for one month here...

964
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,376
...we'll definitely get our
certificates, right?

965
01:06:31,454 --> 01:06:34,446
You will get. You'll definitely get.

966
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:36,857
At present you take rest.

967
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:41,054
Kamla.
Yes?

968
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,062
Take them all to the government
guest house.

969
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:46,193
Okay?
All right, sir.

970
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:48,601
It is not a five star but...

971
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:50,464
Yes.

972
01:07:07,357 --> 01:07:08,415
Come in.

973
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:14,955
Quite an advanced place.

974
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:17,491
No screen.

975
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:20,869
Are all films of Ram Gopal
Verma shot here or what?

976
01:07:22,238 --> 01:07:24,866
Wow! Eco-friendly smokeless candle.

977
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:31,040
Guys, so obviously this
is a boy's hostel.

978
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:33,582
And that is the girl's hostel.

979
01:07:33,984 --> 01:07:36,179
This means mother Tee is
my permanent roommate?

980
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:41,087
By the way I am ready to become
your new, fresh roommate.

981
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:42,281
But I am not.

982
01:07:42,459 --> 01:07:43,892
I prefer lectures to rap.

983
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,593
Sir, where should I
keep this luggage?

984
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:51,898
Hey what are you doing, pal?

985
01:07:52,936 --> 01:07:54,460
Carefully. With manners, pal.

986
01:07:54,537 --> 01:07:55,936
Give a little respect.

987
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,414
I guess not.

988
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:07,541
Why did I even try?

989
01:08:08,885 --> 01:08:11,410
Sir, I want money for vegetables.

990
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:12,546
Take it from him.

991
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:16,917
Here. Take this.

992
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:30,030
Bungs, two chilled.

993
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:33,101
Listen... will I get
a clean bedsheet?

994
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:35,910
I don't have a clean one, madam.

995
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,443
Great! Will I get a role?

996
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:38,972
To hang from the fan.

997
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:42,576
Pepsi! This is a bad joke
in a place like this.

998
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:44,443
You have seen a suicide attempt
in the morning itself.

999
01:08:44,888 --> 01:08:46,048
Don't be so insensitive, pal.

1000
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:47,985
Now you are being over sensitive!

1001
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:50,085
Were those who died in the morning
your relatives?

1002
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,089
No, right? Then why, pal?

1003
01:08:52,495 --> 01:08:55,123
Not today, madam. But
they were, last year.

1004
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,192
My brother, his wife
and his two kids.

1005
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,549
Listen... hey!

1006
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:30,296
You were going to come
to the Circuit house.

1007
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:33,902
What? Yes.

1008
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:36,897
l was tired.

1009
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:38,899
l thought what's the hurry?

1010
01:09:39,309 --> 01:09:40,503
I'll freshen up and come.

1011
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:43,904
Please sit.

1012
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:47,580
Err... no. Actually we
are also in a hurry.

1013
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:51,583
It takes 68 hours from
here to reach Goa, right?

1014
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:55,082
Goa?
Goa?

1015
01:09:55,458 --> 01:09:56,482
T!
What for?

1016
01:09:58,061 --> 01:10:00,393
Goa is at least 16 hours'
journey from here.

1017
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:02,394
16! Oh God!

1018
01:10:06,402 --> 01:10:07,596
Will we get any bus for there?

1019
01:10:07,937 --> 01:10:09,996
But guys, we've come here for
rural... Oh T! Not right now.

1020
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:12,933
Any bus?

1021
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:14,067
You could have got.

1022
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,069
But a three-day strike is going on.

1023
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:20,611
Can we get any taxi
or vehicle here?

1024
01:10:22,218 --> 01:10:23,276
The landlord has it.

1025
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:28,520
But he doesn't trust
outsiders so soon.

1026
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:33,187
And even if you get it...

1027
01:10:35,565 --> 01:10:37,624
...the problem of certificate
will still be there.

1028
01:10:37,901 --> 01:10:38,959
Why will it be left out?

1029
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:40,093
When we'll work here
for one month...

1030
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:41,296
...you'll definitely give
us the certificates.

1031
01:10:42,438 --> 01:10:43,496
Yes?

1032
01:10:45,909 --> 01:10:48,104
The plan to go to Goa has
been made since so long.

1033
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:50,909
Now to think you'll stop here
for so many days is a sin.

1034
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:52,379
Excuse me, sir...

1035
01:10:52,448 --> 01:10:53,642
Why won't we wait? We've
come here for this.

1036
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,109
T! T, be realistic.

1037
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,309
We can't be working here.

1038
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:57,648
You just control her.
T, just wait.

1039
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,388
Actually we are in a little hurry.

1040
01:11:01,391 --> 01:11:04,451
Err... how will we get the
certificates? How?

1041
01:11:06,296 --> 01:11:07,388
As you always get it.

1042
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:13,927
By giving bribe.

1043
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:18,133
Yes. Okay fine. How
much will it take?

1044
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:20,000
10,000 rupees.

1045
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:21,601
Each!

1046
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:25,139
But we'll give you money after
we get the certificates.

1047
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:29,210
Take them now.

1048
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:32,150
I'll date it 30 days late.

1049
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,880
Only because of corrupt officers
like you...

1050
01:11:33,923 --> 01:11:35,117
...there is no one to help here.

1051
01:11:35,325 --> 01:11:38,988
You keep your help with you.

1052
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:42,291
We get more help from
the money you give us.

1053
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:45,361
You are disgusting. Listen...

1054
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:47,636
Vishakha! Vishakha!

1055
01:11:47,937 --> 01:11:50,371
Vishakha, just listen to me. Wait.

1056
01:11:51,374 --> 01:11:52,568
Sir, you don't worry about her.

1057
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,304
We'll get the certificates, right?

1058
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:58,641
I am not able to digest it.

1059
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:07,981
Khuts!

1060
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,124
Did you get the signal?

1061
01:12:18,601 --> 01:12:23,004
You know Nancy, Neha and Nuzhat
will be so worried!

1062
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:24,998
I can understand, man.

1063
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:29,007
Listen... you think can
you get me an intro?

1064
01:12:31,414 --> 01:12:32,472
Yes?

1065
01:12:33,216 --> 01:12:34,274
Come on, man!

1066
01:12:52,568 --> 01:12:54,092
Babia! Babia!

1067
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:57,302
There is a call for
Babia from Nasik.

1068
01:12:57,974 --> 01:13:00,238
It will come again after 5 minutes.

1069
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:02,241
Babia! Babia!

1070
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:05,171
What's this, brother?

1071
01:13:05,248 --> 01:13:07,239
There is only one phone
for the entire village here.

1072
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,113
Is that's why this loud speaker
is installed? Yes.

1073
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:28,594
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1074
01:13:30,006 --> 01:13:32,474
Listen... why aren't you
allowing me to work?

1075
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:34,273
I am here since morning.
Take a breath.

1076
01:13:35,478 --> 01:13:36,604
Baby, see there.

1077
01:13:38,881 --> 01:13:41,281
Why do you want
to work at such a place?

1078
01:13:42,218 --> 01:13:43,617
So that this won't be
such a place anymore.

1079
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,278
I can help.

1080
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:48,914
Listen madam, I told you earlier too.

1081
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:51,084
You keep your help with yourself.

1082
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,287
I want my 50,000 rupees. That's it.

1083
01:13:55,965 --> 01:13:57,626
I will not give you a single paisa.

1084
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,629
And I will complain against
you in the college too.

1085
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:04,039
Okay. Make it.

1086
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:11,870
If you let me work then I am
ready to give 10,000 too.

1087
01:14:15,918 --> 01:14:17,886
Yes sir. That side.

1088
01:14:19,255 --> 01:14:22,588
I am going.
Why? Won't you come inside?

1089
01:14:23,059 --> 01:14:24,890
No I owe some debt to him.

1090
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:26,986
He will catch me.
But...

1091
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,256
I am going.
But wait, boss...

1092
01:14:28,464 --> 01:14:30,398
Hey listen... Hey listen...

1093
01:14:32,268 --> 01:14:33,326
What's wrong with him?

1094
01:14:34,003 --> 01:14:35,129
Who knows!

1095
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:40,533
Come on let's hire the car.

1096
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:43,203
Come on, move ahead.

1097
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:44,337
Tell me. What is your name?

1098
01:14:44,414 --> 01:14:46,279
Narayan.
Tell me your full name.

1099
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:47,941
Narayan Sakharam Jadhav.
Yes.

1100
01:14:48,017 --> 01:14:49,075
Come on, speak further.
What do you want?

1101
01:14:49,152 --> 01:14:51,086
Give me a sack of wheat
and one sack of sorghum.

1102
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:53,088
See what is his remaining account?
Yes, I'll see.

1103
01:14:53,222 --> 01:14:55,486
See how much he owes?
It is 2500 rupees.

1104
01:14:55,625 --> 01:14:57,593
2500. Come on, move ahead.

1105
01:14:57,927 --> 01:14:59,326
Tell me, Baba. What do you want?

1106
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,553
5 sacks of cottonseeds.

1107
01:15:00,897 --> 01:15:02,421
Come on, see Baba's account.
Yes, yes.

1108
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:06,366
Nitin, you come here. Yes?
What do you want? Tell me.

1109
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,235
The phone is ringing
since a long time.

1110
01:15:13,843 --> 01:15:14,969
Won't anyone receive it?

1111
01:15:16,312 --> 01:15:20,043
Hello? At present Master's
massage is going on.

1112
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:21,917
Call after half hour.

1113
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:24,445
Tell me.

1114
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:26,881
We need a car to go to Goa.

1115
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:29,585
Someone told that you can help us.

1116
01:15:32,295 --> 01:15:35,594
I can definitely help.
But why should I? Yes?

1117
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:38,332
You are not my relatives.

1118
01:15:41,471 --> 01:15:42,529
Good joke, sir.

1119
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:44,336
But we are giving you money.

1120
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:48,601
How much money?

1121
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:50,937
According to the present rate.

1122
01:15:53,149 --> 01:15:54,616
Have you brought money
along with you?

1123
01:15:57,286 --> 01:16:00,551
We'll give money only after
reaching Goa, sir.

1124
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:04,051
That how many kilometers it
is and how much is the fare?

1125
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:11,232
What if you refuse to give
money after reaching Goa?

1126
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:17,032
Then we'll give you in advance.

1127
01:16:18,241 --> 01:16:21,369
What if you run away
midway with the car then?

1128
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,105
Why will we snatch the car and run?

1129
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:30,049
The car is more expensive
than the rent.

1130
01:16:30,453 --> 01:16:32,444
Hello uncle, do we look
thieves to you?

1131
01:16:32,922 --> 01:16:34,253
We are Medical College students...

1132
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:38,458
Speak softly. Okay?

1133
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:42,522
They are laid to make
the people silent.

1134
01:16:46,469 --> 01:16:48,994
Come on, pal. We'll take the
car from someone else.

1135
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:52,068
You won't get! You will never get.

1136
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:56,011
When people hear that
I've refused to give...

1137
01:16:56,078 --> 01:16:57,204
...then no one will give.

1138
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:01,347
Hey? We are ready to give you
the full amount. And you...

1139
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:09,152
I know, dear. I know.

1140
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:13,828
But I do something for
anyone only when...

1141
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:16,956
...someone is indebted
to me for a lifetime.

1142
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:21,293
He gives right to me on his things.

1143
01:17:22,505 --> 01:17:24,029
He increases my strength.

1144
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:26,499
You are a stranger.

1145
01:17:27,043 --> 01:17:28,101
You are an outsider.

1146
01:17:29,178 --> 01:17:31,373
You can't fulfill my demands.

1147
01:17:36,052 --> 01:17:40,580
Go. Go away.

1148
01:17:44,961 --> 01:17:47,122
Sir, you called my son right now.

1149
01:17:49,899 --> 01:17:51,127
I am just saying that if
l get a chance then...

1150
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,997
Hey why? Come here.

1151
01:17:53,536 --> 01:17:55,595
l have made the discussion
with your mother.

1152
01:17:56,272 --> 01:17:57,534
Hey! Hey Kamla!

1153
01:17:58,074 --> 01:17:59,336
Hey scoundrel!

1154
01:18:01,811 --> 01:18:03,210
I've warned you a thousand
times, didn't l?

1155
01:18:03,946 --> 01:18:05,277
Don't bring your women at my house.

1156
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:10,010
Because of you no women
come to work in house.

1157
01:18:10,553 --> 01:18:12,544
This wretched girl was not ready
to massage me, father.

1158
01:18:14,857 --> 01:18:19,851
Hey girlie, go. Go now.

1159
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:31,872
Why are you humiliating me
in front of guests, father?

1160
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,875
You were scared and in deep trouble.

1161
01:18:36,512 --> 01:18:38,571
Out of Shankar's fear. Right?

1162
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:48,847
If I were not here
you would not have been...

1163
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:51,451
...roaming like a rich man
in front of all there.

1164
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,085
Understood?

1165
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:59,599
Catch him. This scoundrel speaks
anything in front of anyone.

1166
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:04,530
Catch him.

1167
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,012
How will he catch me?

1168
01:19:19,422 --> 01:19:20,548
I am smeared with oil.

1169
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:27,354
Let's leave, Rahul.

1170
01:19:28,097 --> 01:19:29,223
These people are crazy.

1171
01:19:35,095 --> 01:19:37,359
So we'll have to wait here
until the strike gets over?

1172
01:19:38,298 --> 01:19:42,826
Yes. It's seems so.
Great!

1173
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:46,905
Butter, whenever you
are needed the most...

1174
01:19:47,240 --> 01:19:48,832
...you always fail.

1175
01:19:50,243 --> 01:19:53,508
There is some written message
for me in this like always.

1176
01:19:54,181 --> 01:19:55,910
You are just reacting
in frustration.

1177
01:19:57,317 --> 01:19:58,375
What do you mean by that?

1178
01:19:58,785 --> 01:19:59,809
You know what I mean.

1179
01:20:00,821 --> 01:20:02,413
Rahul, I am not able
to sleep whole night.

1180
01:20:02,889 --> 01:20:05,084
Again? Damn!
I am serious, Rahul.

1181
01:20:05,292 --> 01:20:07,920
Neither can we eat nor
sleep properly here.

1182
01:20:08,195 --> 01:20:09,253
This is hell!

1183
01:20:10,864 --> 01:20:12,195
Okay it was your program, right?

1184
01:20:12,999 --> 01:20:14,193
To take us to Goa.

1185
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:15,791
And you have brought us here.

1186
01:20:16,136 --> 01:20:17,797
Now you are going to get
us out of here. Okay?

1187
01:20:18,872 --> 01:20:19,930
I tried, okay?

1188
01:20:20,874 --> 01:20:23,468
But even I fail to understand
some people.

1189
01:20:26,813 --> 01:20:28,474
May be my beginner's luck
has finally run out.

1190
01:20:28,548 --> 01:20:31,278
Peace be upon us!

1191
01:20:32,219 --> 01:20:33,186
Peace!

1192
01:20:33,887 --> 01:20:35,752
Mama T! Mama T!

1193
01:20:39,759 --> 01:20:40,953
So tell me, Mama T.

1194
01:20:41,228 --> 01:20:44,288
How did you like serving
the poor villagers?

1195
01:20:44,364 --> 01:20:45,490
Buzz off, Baghani.

1196
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,026
Guys, it was really enlightening.

1197
01:20:49,102 --> 01:20:51,093
I've never seen anything in
my life like this before!

1198
01:20:51,171 --> 01:20:53,366
Huh!
It really was! Boo!

1199
01:20:54,441 --> 01:20:56,170
Hey? This is too much!

1200
01:20:57,244 --> 01:20:58,973
Never mind. Never mind.

1201
01:20:59,246 --> 01:21:00,907
What if there is no light?

1202
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,778
We have enlightenment with us.

1203
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:06,177
The dark evening in
the name of Mama T.

1204
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:08,219
And one goblet of wine with it.

1205
01:21:08,321 --> 01:21:10,983
Cheers everyone!
Ow! You fool! There was my nose.

1206
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:27,201
Who is it?

1207
01:21:27,274 --> 01:21:29,538
Brother! Brother! We
have found Digambar.

1208
01:21:29,809 --> 01:21:31,401
Will I derive money from everyone?

1209
01:21:33,146 --> 01:21:34,477
Teach him a good lesson.

1210
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:46,055
I still have to praise
your husband yet.

1211
01:21:48,094 --> 01:21:50,756
Who is neither able to relay...

1212
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:52,957
...the debt nor the interest amount.

1213
01:21:54,901 --> 01:21:58,894
Now I can't send away the
borrower empty handed.

1214
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:05,842
Or like that scoundrel
Digambar who...

1215
01:22:06,980 --> 01:22:08,038
Ran away.

1216
01:22:14,321 --> 01:22:17,188
What is your name? Yes?

1217
01:22:26,199 --> 01:22:28,258
Catch him! Catch him!
Hey come on, catch him.

1218
01:22:28,335 --> 01:22:29,996
Hey catch him! Catch him! Catch him!

1219
01:22:31,471 --> 01:22:32,802
Hit him! Thrash him!

1220
01:22:32,872 --> 01:22:37,400
Hit him! Thrash this scoundrel!
Hit him!

1221
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:43,408
He ran away. Hey catch him.
Catch him. Catch him.

1222
01:23:08,174 --> 01:23:09,971
Hey! Come here.

1223
01:23:10,176 --> 01:23:11,234
Come on. Hurry up.

1224
01:23:14,914 --> 01:23:15,972
Hey check upstairs.

1225
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:38,328
What the hell?

1226
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:39,733
Who are they?

1227
01:23:42,342 --> 01:23:43,741
Hey, open the door.

1228
01:23:46,946 --> 01:23:48,140
Mother T, get up.

1229
01:23:51,418 --> 01:23:52,476
Open the door.

1230
01:23:56,189 --> 01:23:57,247
What's wrong, brother?

1231
01:23:57,357 --> 01:23:58,381
What the hell is going on?

1232
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,085
Did Digambar come this way?

1233
01:24:00,226 --> 01:24:01,955
He owes money to our master.

1234
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:04,160
There is no Digambar here.

1235
01:24:04,230 --> 01:24:05,288
We want to search inside.

1236
01:24:05,365 --> 01:24:06,957
Brother, didn't we tell you
there is no one here. But...

1237
01:24:07,033 --> 01:24:08,295
Listen... you go inside. Didn't we
tell there is no one here? But...

1238
01:24:08,368 --> 01:24:09,426
What's going on here?

1239
01:24:11,037 --> 01:24:12,163
Doctors live here.

1240
01:24:12,839 --> 01:24:13,965
They have ladies with them.

1241
01:24:14,107 --> 01:24:15,165
Why will he come here?

1242
01:24:15,241 --> 01:24:17,232
Hey doctor, don't interfere.

1243
01:24:17,977 --> 01:24:19,376
Listen brother, this is
a government guest house.

1244
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:22,444
If you search government
guest house...

1245
01:24:23,116 --> 01:24:24,242
...then the matter will become worse.

1246
01:24:25,251 --> 01:24:26,513
l won't interfere.

1247
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:28,414
You still want to search?

1248
01:24:29,389 --> 01:24:30,788
Do you want to search now?

1249
01:24:33,326 --> 01:24:35,726
Hey, make your husband understand.

1250
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:37,261
We've killed him half now.

1251
01:24:37,397 --> 01:24:38,921
We'll kill him completely very soon.

1252
01:24:39,132 --> 01:24:40,793
Tell him to send the money there.

1253
01:24:40,867 --> 01:24:42,732
Or sign the land documents.

1254
01:24:43,870 --> 01:24:44,928
Hey come on.

1255
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:46,263
Understood?

1256
01:24:49,342 --> 01:24:51,139
What's all this? Yes?

1257
01:24:51,478 --> 01:24:52,740
Who are they?

1258
01:24:53,813 --> 01:24:54,871
You all go to sleep.

1259
01:25:35,955 --> 01:25:37,013
There!

1260
01:25:52,939 --> 01:25:58,809
Oh God! Look Chief, they've
thrashed him so much.

1261
01:26:15,828 --> 01:26:16,886
Nothing has happened to him.

1262
01:26:17,363 --> 01:26:18,421
He is absolutely fine.

1263
01:26:19,365 --> 01:26:22,766
Chief, they won't spare me.

1264
01:26:23,169 --> 01:26:25,296
Then give him the land.

1265
01:26:26,306 --> 01:26:28,831
Then what will we do? Yes?

1266
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:30,033
Give him the land! Huh!

1267
01:26:30,109 --> 01:26:31,167
What will we eat?

1268
01:26:31,244 --> 01:26:32,302
What are you eating now, scoundrel?

1269
01:26:32,378 --> 01:26:33,367
Getting thrashed?

1270
01:26:36,316 --> 01:26:37,840
What the hell is going on here?

1271
01:26:41,955 --> 01:26:43,013
He is the same.

1272
01:26:45,959 --> 01:26:47,051
He was hiding here!

1273
01:26:48,928 --> 01:26:51,396
And you both knew this?

1274
01:26:56,336 --> 01:26:59,396
What if they had
come to know? Then?

1275
01:27:03,876 --> 01:27:04,934
Just get him out of here.

1276
01:27:06,012 --> 01:27:07,070
That's what I am doing.

1277
01:27:08,414 --> 01:27:09,472
Shall I bandage him first?

1278
01:27:11,884 --> 01:27:13,749
Madam, do you have anything...

1279
01:27:13,786 --> 01:27:15,754
...else besides gloves in your box?

1280
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,350
Sure. Just give me a minute.

1281
01:27:18,992 --> 01:27:20,823
Whatever you're getting,
get it quickly.

1282
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:24,888
What's the matter?

1283
01:27:26,766 --> 01:27:29,098
Debt! Loan!

1284
01:27:30,503 --> 01:27:31,765
That can't be repaid.

1285
01:27:32,772 --> 01:27:34,364
He took it from the bank
then the bank was after him.

1286
01:27:35,441 --> 01:27:37,432
To pay the bank
he borrowed from Wagh.

1287
01:27:38,311 --> 01:27:39,437
Now Wagh is after him.

1288
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:44,113
Now bank will not give a loan
to relay Wagh, right?

1289
01:27:44,317 --> 01:27:45,375
Again?

1290
01:27:48,721 --> 01:27:52,714
Chief, let me hide
somewhere here. Here.

1291
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,261
If I'll go out I'll be done for.

1292
01:27:58,064 --> 01:27:59,326
They will kill me.

1293
01:28:02,402 --> 01:28:04,461
No pal, no.

1294
01:28:06,139 --> 01:28:07,868
Will you hold this?
Yeah.

1295
01:28:10,343 --> 01:28:11,867
l can't tell them.

1296
01:28:13,346 --> 01:28:15,337
Because if the people outside
come to know this.

1297
01:28:16,349 --> 01:28:17,816
There is a risk to their lives.

1298
01:28:19,986 --> 01:28:21,078
Now it's their wish.

1299
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:25,387
If they wish they
can save your life.

1300
01:28:26,125 --> 01:28:28,093
And if they wish they
can throw you out.

1301
01:28:28,227 --> 01:28:29,285
To die!

1302
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:34,366
Hide me somewhere here
in the toilet, Chief.

1303
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:36,826
l can't live outside.
Listen, brother.

1304
01:28:39,172 --> 01:28:40,230
Come on, guys.

1305
01:28:40,306 --> 01:28:41,432
I am sure we can do something.

1306
01:28:41,708 --> 01:28:44,973
Are you crazy? You know these
people are like that.

1307
01:28:45,778 --> 01:28:47,712
They don't work carefully
and they get into debts.

1308
01:28:48,715 --> 01:28:49,977
All these are just excuses.

1309
01:28:50,783 --> 01:28:52,751
My dad gave work to so many
of them at his farm.

1310
01:28:52,852 --> 01:28:55,047
And they only drank liquor
and misbehaved with dad.

1311
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,146
T, Wagh is a very dangerous man.

1312
01:28:57,357 --> 01:28:58,824
And his son is crazier.

1313
01:28:59,158 --> 01:29:00,716
You saw their men, didn't you?

1314
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:03,124
If they come to know that
we've hidden him here.

1315
01:29:03,463 --> 01:29:05,124
Then they can do anything, pal.

1316
01:29:06,466 --> 01:29:09,060
We can say we didn't hide him.

1317
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:11,929
How can we let a poor man die?

1318
01:29:12,004 --> 01:29:13,869
Okay fine, even they come here.

1319
01:29:13,940 --> 01:29:15,931
Then I can promise
to give them money.

1320
01:29:16,008 --> 01:29:17,339
Just stop it, Vishakha.

1321
01:29:17,877 --> 01:29:19,276
How many people will you pay?
Yes?

1322
01:29:21,147 --> 01:29:22,478
And then why should we
get involved in this?

1323
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:24,480
We are outsiders. Remember?

1324
01:29:27,086 --> 01:29:28,781
I mean they don't trust us anyways.

1325
01:29:29,355 --> 01:29:30,754
But we can't just let
him go like that.

1326
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:31,848
Just shut up!

1327
01:29:33,226 --> 01:29:34,284
No means no!

1328
01:29:34,427 --> 01:29:35,826
Just look at him, pal! T!

1329
01:29:36,896 --> 01:29:38,295
Why can't you ever understand
anything?

1330
01:29:40,099 --> 01:29:43,091
Go. You go.

1331
01:29:46,105 --> 01:29:49,506
Don't risk their lives
for your sake.

1332
01:29:54,380 --> 01:29:55,438
You go.

1333
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,799
I am not leaving, Khuts.
Do you get that?

1334
01:30:17,870 --> 01:30:18,928
Khuts, leave me.

1335
01:30:19,005 --> 01:30:20,063
Vishakha, let's go.

1336
01:30:22,408 --> 01:30:23,466
I am going, sir.

1337
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:26,269
Hurry up, Vishakha.

1338
01:30:26,345 --> 01:30:27,403
Stop wasting time.

1339
01:30:31,484 --> 01:30:34,078
Khuts, he took total 10,000.

1340
01:30:34,487 --> 01:30:35,749
He didn't even spare a rupee.

1341
01:30:35,788 --> 01:30:39,053
Absolutely disgusting rule.
Come on. Kamlabai! Kamlabai!

1342
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,286
Kamlabai, your Digambar there.

1343
01:31:52,431 --> 01:31:53,898
It has reached a thousand.

1344
01:31:58,504 --> 01:31:59,766
Of this territory.

1345
01:32:01,974 --> 01:32:03,066
Who will weep now?

1346
01:32:12,318 --> 01:32:17,187
How much loan did he owe?
55,000.

1347
01:32:19,425 --> 01:32:20,517
That's it?

1348
01:32:24,797 --> 01:32:27,789
There is a custom to
give up life for...

1349
01:32:27,867 --> 01:32:29,334
...2530 thousand in this territory.

1350
01:32:35,274 --> 01:32:38,072
But... but why was he unable
relay the loan?

1351
01:32:39,812 --> 01:32:40,870
Wasn't the harvest good?

1352
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,742
It was very good.

1353
01:32:45,017 --> 01:32:46,348
But whatever he got
after selling it...

1354
01:32:47,787 --> 01:32:49,778
...the manure for next year has
to be brought with that.

1355
01:32:50,189 --> 01:32:51,247
Purchase the seeds too.

1356
01:32:51,857 --> 01:32:53,154
Then he needs a little for food too.

1357
01:32:53,292 --> 01:32:54,816
Then little liquor is required too.

1358
01:32:55,761 --> 01:32:57,160
Then loan again, right?

1359
01:32:59,231 --> 01:33:03,031
But I heard these money lenders
don't exist anymore.

1360
01:33:03,102 --> 01:33:04,160
They don't exist.

1361
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:08,033
The government has ended the money
lenders long before.

1362
01:33:09,775 --> 01:33:11,174
Now look at this poor Wagh.

1363
01:33:12,244 --> 01:33:13,438
He is not a money lender.

1364
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,247
He just sells manure.

1365
01:33:16,849 --> 01:33:18,111
Poor man is just a supplier.

1366
01:33:18,851 --> 01:33:21,979
But these farmers don't
purchase stuff from him.

1367
01:33:22,221 --> 01:33:23,279
They take it on debt.

1368
01:33:24,890 --> 01:33:28,053
And these farmers made that
poor Wagh a money lender.

1369
01:33:28,260 --> 01:33:29,386
Poor man has become one!

1370
01:33:31,397 --> 01:33:32,796
How much interest did
he take from them?

1371
01:33:32,865 --> 01:33:35,265
Only 40°/°.

1372
01:33:36,202 --> 01:33:37,260
40°/°?

1373
01:33:38,871 --> 01:33:41,738
Oh shucks! This is so unfair!

1374
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:47,072
Dad recently financed
a new Mercedes at 12°/°.

1375
01:33:47,346 --> 01:33:50,804
The bank knows that your
dad will return it.

1376
01:33:52,018 --> 01:33:53,485
Which bank will give them a loan...

1377
01:33:54,153 --> 01:33:56,451
...when it knows they won't be
able to return anything?

1378
01:33:58,758 --> 01:34:00,817
In the city everyone has
a mobile on his lips.

1379
01:34:01,427 --> 01:34:05,761
And here? The pesticide bottle.

1380
01:34:10,503 --> 01:34:11,765
We came here and heard
that this problem...

1381
01:34:11,837 --> 01:34:13,031
...prevails in all
the districts here.

1382
01:34:15,107 --> 01:34:16,301
In seven other states too.

1383
01:34:20,513 --> 01:34:22,242
Then why is there
no news about this?

1384
01:34:22,782 --> 01:34:26,047
There is. The news agency
gives the news.

1385
01:34:27,319 --> 01:34:29,810
But then some actor gets married.

1386
01:34:30,423 --> 01:34:32,220
You all go to dance.

1387
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,056
Then Indian cricket team
loses some game.

1388
01:34:35,194 --> 01:34:36,320
It is winning nowadays too.

1389
01:34:37,463 --> 01:34:39,124
Some boy falls in a ditch.

1390
01:34:39,932 --> 01:34:44,460
But only by news their miserable
deaths won't end.

1391
01:34:53,212 --> 01:34:55,077
So what is the solution
to this problem?

1392
01:34:56,749 --> 01:34:58,080
When someone will
think of a solution...

1393
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:59,344
...then only will
he find the solution.

1394
01:35:00,786 --> 01:35:03,050
People are not ready to
consider this a problem.

1395
01:35:03,856 --> 01:35:05,790
Long ago the government
had given a slogan.

1396
01:35:06,459 --> 01:35:08,017
'Live long young man,
live long farmer.'

1397
01:35:08,094 --> 01:35:09,152
They have given it.

1398
01:35:11,163 --> 01:35:13,427
Youths are becoming martyrs
fighting terrorists.

1399
01:35:14,033 --> 01:35:18,436
Farmers are ruined fighting
hunger and debts.

1400
01:35:19,839 --> 01:35:21,966
Mom, you didn't tell me.

1401
01:35:22,508 --> 01:35:24,305
What was our ancestral business?

1402
01:35:24,376 --> 01:35:25,502
Dear, you know, right?

1403
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:28,313
We were Nabobs. We had
many businesses.

1404
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:30,507
Mom, I am asking you
a straight question.

1405
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:33,045
8 years ago when
we made this union...

1406
01:35:33,719 --> 01:35:35,346
...how did we get so much land?

1407
01:35:37,123 --> 01:35:39,148
We didn't purchase any
land from anyone.

1408
01:35:39,725 --> 01:35:40,783
And as far as I remember...

1409
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:42,327
...there was no land deal too.

1410
01:35:42,394 --> 01:35:45,852
Oh that! Those lands
had become ours.

1411
01:35:46,065 --> 01:35:48,329
The farmers were not able
to relay our loans.

1412
01:35:50,202 --> 01:35:52,727
Oh! This means we were
money lenders...

1413
01:35:52,805 --> 01:35:55,467
...who snatched the lands
of the farmers?

1414
01:35:55,941 --> 01:35:56,999
We didn't snatch them, dear.

1415
01:35:57,343 --> 01:35:59,004
The lands became ours.

1416
01:35:59,278 --> 01:36:02,338
Huh! It's as simple, right mom?

1417
01:36:05,484 --> 01:36:06,883
Okay I'll talk later.

1418
01:36:06,986 --> 01:36:09,352
Hey dear, listen to me. How can I ...

1419
01:36:35,314 --> 01:36:36,372
Chief!

1420
01:37:01,807 --> 01:37:06,403
Hey doctor? From where are
you coming? Yes?

1421
01:37:09,081 --> 01:37:12,209
I am going to see one
patient at his house.

1422
01:37:13,485 --> 01:37:15,146
l have come to take my assistant.

1423
01:37:15,187 --> 01:37:16,449
Oh! Oh!

1424
01:37:16,856 --> 01:37:17,948
O' madam.

1425
01:37:19,758 --> 01:37:21,487
Assistant? Huh!

1426
01:37:22,494 --> 01:37:25,429
There is an emergency.
Come with me.

1427
01:37:25,764 --> 01:37:28,232
This is too much.
You need my help?

1428
01:37:30,035 --> 01:37:33,163
Yes. I've to save one man's life!

1429
01:37:33,439 --> 01:37:35,100
Will you come?
Sure.

1430
01:37:35,708 --> 01:37:36,766
Just give me a minute.

1431
01:37:42,982 --> 01:37:44,040
From where did you
get this ambulance?

1432
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:46,108
I have taken it on loan.

1433
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:49,415
And these ward boys?
I will tell you.

1434
01:37:51,223 --> 01:37:52,349
Where are we going?

1435
01:37:55,394 --> 01:37:56,725
You ask many questions.

1436
01:37:58,264 --> 01:38:00,789
Beautiful girls look better
when they are silent.

1437
01:38:01,133 --> 01:38:02,191
Please come.

1438
01:38:05,871 --> 01:38:06,929
Climb up.

1439
01:38:31,163 --> 01:38:32,221
Whom do you want?

1440
01:38:32,965 --> 01:38:36,423
Err... I am Dr. Porke.

1441
01:38:36,702 --> 01:38:39,170
I see. And who is this madam?
My assistant.

1442
01:38:39,305 --> 01:38:41,034
You called up at the
big hospital, right?

1443
01:38:41,106 --> 01:38:42,300
Yes, yes, I called up.

1444
01:38:42,441 --> 01:38:43,772
Then why are you
hiding your face?

1445
01:38:43,842 --> 01:38:44,968
Someone is sick at home, right?

1446
01:38:45,044 --> 01:38:46,306
Yes, yes, Mr. Wagh.

1447
01:38:47,313 --> 01:38:50,043
Shall we come in?
Yes, yes, please come, sir.

1448
01:38:50,115 --> 01:38:51,241
Come. Please come. Please come.
Come.

1449
01:38:51,317 --> 01:38:52,750
Come here. Come inside. Come.

1450
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:27,878
Where is he? They have hidden
him in the basement.

1451
01:39:28,787 --> 01:39:30,379
Come on, let's go. Come on.
Come.

1452
01:39:32,825 --> 01:39:33,883
Where is his son?

1453
01:39:33,959 --> 01:39:35,483
He has gone for hunting.
l see.

1454
01:39:39,898 --> 01:39:43,356
Hey don't touch...
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1455
01:39:43,435 --> 01:39:46,165
My throat! Neck!
Take breath.

1456
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:48,297
My throat.
Yes good.

1457
01:39:49,775 --> 01:39:52,437
Come, come. Slowly.

1458
01:39:53,912 --> 01:39:57,245
I had mixed as much poison (Datura)
As Chief had told me.

1459
01:39:57,316 --> 01:39:58,374
Okay fine. Come on.

1460
01:40:00,819 --> 01:40:01,979
Look there.

1461
01:40:14,333 --> 01:40:15,391
Brother Shankya.

1462
01:40:17,469 --> 01:40:18,527
He is alive.

1463
01:40:19,138 --> 01:40:21,470
Brother Shankya! Brother Shankya!
Brother Shankya!

1464
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:24,075
Are you listening?
Yes.

1465
01:40:24,410 --> 01:40:25,468
Come on, take him.

1466
01:40:28,414 --> 01:40:30,211
There is no need to give this
medicine today. Okay.

1467
01:40:30,949 --> 01:40:32,439
But give him this medicine
tomorrow. All right.

1468
01:40:36,455 --> 01:40:38,389
Two!
What?

1469
01:40:40,826 --> 01:40:42,293
2000.
2000?

1470
01:40:46,498 --> 01:40:47,760
My fees.

1471
01:40:49,101 --> 01:40:50,432
This is a little high.

1472
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:52,497
It is the life of a big man.

1473
01:40:53,972 --> 01:40:55,098
So it will be expensive.

1474
01:40:58,377 --> 01:40:59,503
Count it properly.
Yes.

1475
01:41:00,446 --> 01:41:02,437
Bring this very medicine of
this company. Yes sir.

1476
01:41:02,514 --> 01:41:04,243
Do you know Hindi or shall
I tell you in Marathi?

1477
01:41:04,316 --> 01:41:05,783
No we understand. We understand.

1478
01:41:05,851 --> 01:41:06,909
Of this very company.

1479
01:41:06,985 --> 01:41:10,079
Sir. Here.
Madam. Take.

1480
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:15,918
What's all this going on?

1481
01:41:17,796 --> 01:41:18,854
Will you tell me anything?

1482
01:41:18,931 --> 01:41:20,990
You wanted to help these
villagers, right?

1483
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:22,867
You wanted to serve them.

1484
01:41:23,001 --> 01:41:24,263
Just think you have helped.

1485
01:41:24,336 --> 01:41:25,530
People will bless you for years.

1486
01:41:25,804 --> 01:41:27,066
Move him inside. Inside. But
what's all this going on?

1487
01:41:27,139 --> 01:41:28,197
Who is he?

1488
01:41:31,009 --> 01:41:36,948
Question again? Will
you come? Come soon.

1489
01:41:42,187 --> 01:41:45,350
"O' beloved Jane."

1490
01:41:45,457 --> 01:41:50,360
"Touched for the very first time."

1491
01:41:50,896 --> 01:41:51,954
Hey shut up!

1492
01:41:52,898 --> 01:41:54,024
Why are you yelling?

1493
01:41:54,099 --> 01:41:56,897
Hey get down! Get down! Get down.
Huh?

1494
01:41:56,969 --> 01:41:58,436
I have to return.
What?

1495
01:41:58,504 --> 01:42:00,495
I have to give an important letter.
Hey listen... hey you...

1496
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,899
You dropped me at wrong address.

1497
01:42:04,042 --> 01:42:05,168
Hey postman...

1498
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:24,452
'Desert Rose! '

1499
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:31,464
'No! Such a girl can never be here.'

1500
01:42:33,872 --> 01:42:36,067
'All this is the effect of liquor.'

1501
01:42:37,409 --> 01:42:38,933
'I can prove it.'

1502
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:42,270
'She'll disappear
as soon I touch her.'

1503
01:42:49,154 --> 01:42:51,782
Hey you! You're harassing a girl.
No. Sorry.

1504
01:42:51,857 --> 01:42:55,349
Take this. And this. Idiot!

1505
01:42:55,427 --> 01:42:56,485
Hey stop. Stop.

1506
01:43:05,304 --> 01:43:07,363
Your security is very tight.

1507
01:43:09,775 --> 01:43:12,039
Actually I'm a little tight too.

1508
01:43:12,978 --> 01:43:14,912
I thought you weren't even real.

1509
01:43:18,317 --> 01:43:20,114
Dr. Shomindu Baghani.

1510
01:43:20,185 --> 01:43:21,379
Kasturba medical college.

1511
01:43:22,221 --> 01:43:24,416
I have come on rural training here.

1512
01:43:27,793 --> 01:43:29,260
Nice meeting you.

1513
01:43:34,733 --> 01:43:35,995
How can I make it up to you?

1514
01:43:36,468 --> 01:43:38,868
Perhaps we could have a cup of tea.

1515
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:41,063
Or coffee?

1516
01:43:56,455 --> 01:43:57,752
You?

1517
01:44:02,427 --> 01:44:03,485
You?

1518
01:44:07,099 --> 01:44:08,157
You!

1519
01:44:10,102 --> 01:44:14,971
You? You are a col!

1520
01:44:16,508 --> 01:44:20,774
Spare me, brother.
How did he run away? No.

1521
01:44:20,912 --> 01:44:22,971
I don't know.
How did he run away?

1522
01:44:23,315 --> 01:44:24,907
No brother, no. Please no. Who
has come here last night? Yes?

1523
01:44:25,183 --> 01:44:26,309
No one had come.

1524
01:44:29,488 --> 01:44:32,218
Do you know him? Yes?

1525
01:44:33,191 --> 01:44:35,716
Do you recognize him, scoundrel?
Speak up.

1526
01:44:35,794 --> 01:44:38,922
Do you know him?
Speak up. Tell us.

1527
01:44:39,865 --> 01:44:41,332
What is going on here?

1528
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:42,731
No! No brother, no.

1529
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:46,996
Shankya has run away.

1530
01:44:49,074 --> 01:44:50,336
Was he alive?

1531
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:53,339
Hey speak up!

1532
01:44:53,812 --> 01:44:58,010
Yes. Vabho had tied him downstairs.
Stop it now.

1533
01:44:58,083 --> 01:44:59,744
Why you didn't kill him?

1534
01:44:59,885 --> 01:45:00,977
I was killing him only.

1535
01:45:01,286 --> 01:45:03,345
I was just giving him a suffering
death. What else?

1536
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:11,760
Scoundrel! You are not son at all.

1537
01:45:12,097 --> 01:45:13,962
You have gone crazy.

1538
01:45:14,299 --> 01:45:16,824
Where is my stick? I'll
peel off your skin...

1539
01:45:18,103 --> 01:45:19,900
Go and handle that oldie.
Yes sir.

1540
01:45:19,971 --> 01:45:21,029
Or he'll die standing here.

1541
01:45:22,841 --> 01:45:24,308
Master. Master.

1542
01:45:31,917 --> 01:45:33,748
So you let him run away, right?
No brother, no.

1543
01:45:33,919 --> 01:45:34,943
No, no.

1544
01:45:44,930 --> 01:45:46,124
It was she only, sir.

1545
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:54,196
Where is Shankhya?

1546
01:45:57,075 --> 01:45:58,133
I don't know.

1547
01:45:58,343 --> 01:45:59,810
Don't do a drama, doctor.

1548
01:46:03,882 --> 01:46:07,181
Tell us the address. Soon okay?

1549
01:46:10,455 --> 01:46:13,891
Or you know it will prove
very dreadful to you.

1550
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:16,222
Didn't I tell you?

1551
01:46:16,294 --> 01:46:17,352
I don't know.

1552
01:46:18,764 --> 01:46:20,095
You scoundrel!
Hey?

1553
01:46:20,165 --> 01:46:22,497
So you don't know! Speak up!

1554
01:46:22,834 --> 01:46:25,098
What are you doing! We went
to save your father!

1555
01:46:25,170 --> 01:46:26,967
Stop it! Stop it you scoundrel!

1556
01:46:27,973 --> 01:46:30,771
Tell me creel! Say!

1557
01:46:32,244 --> 01:46:33,233
Say!

1558
01:46:33,311 --> 01:46:37,179
'Creel, tell me! '
'I said I ... I don't know! '

1559
01:46:39,117 --> 01:46:42,450
That's my hospital. I mean
I work here. Hmm... hmm.

1560
01:46:43,955 --> 01:46:46,150
Thank you for the lift... madam.
Bye.

1561
01:46:46,725 --> 01:46:49,250
'You don't know? Tell me
you creel... tell me! '

1562
01:46:58,470 --> 01:46:59,732
Hey move!

1563
01:46:59,805 --> 01:47:02,273
Move!

1564
01:47:03,875 --> 01:47:06,343
Hey! Stop it!

1565
01:47:07,345 --> 01:47:10,746
Have water. Thank God you're safe.
What safe?

1566
01:47:13,351 --> 01:47:14,375
Is this safe?

1567
01:47:16,755 --> 01:47:18,746
The chief was not right
to involve you in all this.

1568
01:47:19,758 --> 01:47:21,487
He has no right
to put your life in danger!

1569
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:23,751
He put his own life too
in danger so that...

1570
01:47:23,829 --> 01:47:24,955
...he could save the people
of this village!

1571
01:47:25,096 --> 01:47:26,358
That he could do
something for them!

1572
01:47:26,965 --> 01:47:30,423
Well... well everybody could
not be like us, Rahul...

1573
01:47:30,502 --> 01:47:32,367
...who keep thinking 24/7
only about self.

1574
01:47:34,773 --> 01:47:36,365
He did it for a good cause.

1575
01:47:36,842 --> 01:47:38,366
To help with the cause, buddy!

1576
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,304
This is not our cause.

1577
01:47:41,379 --> 01:47:43,904
We are going from here in
a few days. That's it.

1578
01:47:44,783 --> 01:47:46,717
'Don't you know how
dangerous they are? '

1579
01:47:46,751 --> 01:47:48,309
People are dying here
everyday, Rahul!

1580
01:47:49,054 --> 01:47:50,715
You won't even understand
anything, buddy.

1581
01:47:52,023 --> 01:47:53,718
It seems that the matter
has to be put...

1582
01:47:53,792 --> 01:47:54,850
...directly into Dr. Mukesh
Jadhav's brains.

1583
01:47:55,260 --> 01:47:56,852
Huh!
Where are you going, Rahul?

1584
01:47:56,928 --> 01:47:59,396
Hospital, to meet the chief.
He is not there.

1585
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,267
There's a show going
on in the big ground.

1586
01:48:03,468 --> 01:48:04,730
The chief is there.

1587
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:07,134
Kats and Bhagani are
also helping them.

1588
01:48:07,339 --> 01:48:08,806
Kats and Bhagani?
Hmm.

1589
01:48:09,808 --> 01:48:11,799
Now what new drama is this?
Huh.

1590
01:48:13,278 --> 01:48:14,336
Damn, man.

1591
01:48:28,894 --> 01:48:32,489
"I'm a golden girl,
a golden branch."

1592
01:48:34,900 --> 01:48:38,097
"I'm a golden girl,
a golden branch...

1593
01:48:38,169 --> 01:48:41,104
...that everyone's heart
feels greedy on."

1594
01:48:41,239 --> 01:48:44,106
"I paint dreams
in golden paint."

1595
01:48:44,175 --> 01:48:47,167
"Cultivate gold with gold."

1596
01:48:47,779 --> 01:48:52,842
"I'm absolutely unique;
I'm a golden corn."

1597
01:48:52,918 --> 01:48:58,720
"You are a golden corn."
"Yes I'm a golden corn."

1598
01:48:58,757 --> 01:49:02,716
"I'm a golden corn."

1599
01:49:02,794 --> 01:49:06,252
"No kohl, no vermilion,
no color on the lips."

1600
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:12,065
"No kohl, no vermilion,
no color on the lips."

1601
01:49:12,137 --> 01:49:15,004
"Even then my body entices."

1602
01:49:15,140 --> 01:49:18,200
"I'm the ready harvest that
fills up the barn."

1603
01:49:18,276 --> 01:49:21,006
"Nobody leaves hungry."

1604
01:49:23,481 --> 01:49:29,249
"I'm a golden corn."
"You are a golden corn."

1605
01:49:29,788 --> 01:49:36,956
"I'm a golden corn...
I'm a golden corn."

1606
01:49:42,834 --> 01:49:49,933
"I'm corn... golden corn."
"I'm corn... golden corn."

1607
01:50:13,131 --> 01:50:19,798
"Your smell is like the soil,
your body is hot like the sun."

1608
01:50:19,871 --> 01:50:26,106
"My smell is like the soil,
my body is hot like the sun."

1609
01:50:26,177 --> 01:50:29,806
"I'll go to him; will
grow in his house...

1610
01:50:29,881 --> 01:50:34,147
...the one who protects me."
"Corn; I'm a golden corn."

1611
01:50:34,185 --> 01:50:40,317
"Corn; You are a golden corn."
"Corn; I'm a golden corn."

1612
01:50:40,392 --> 01:50:43,953
"Corn; I'm a golden corn."

1613
01:50:46,264 --> 01:50:49,427
"Corn; You are a golden corn."
"Corn; I am..."

1614
01:50:49,501 --> 01:50:54,905
"Corn; you are a golden corn."
"Corn; I am... a golden corn."

1615
01:50:54,973 --> 01:50:59,842
"Corn; you are a golden corn."
"Golden corn."

1616
01:51:00,278 --> 01:51:05,306
"Corn; I am... corn; I am...
corn; I am a golden corn."

1617
01:51:05,383 --> 01:51:08,409
Sit. Sit. Sit... sit. Sit. Sit.

1618
01:51:11,322 --> 01:51:16,225
Madam, thanks to you and
to your party. Sit.

1619
01:51:18,196 --> 01:51:19,390
This is Shankhya dada
(elder brother).

1620
01:51:20,932 --> 01:51:24,424
He came a few days ago...
among our people.

1621
01:51:25,403 --> 01:51:27,530
But he was abducted by those people.

1622
01:51:28,039 --> 01:51:31,236
Those who are in the habit of
suppressing the farmers.

1623
01:51:32,877 --> 01:51:35,471
But now dada is free...
he has come among us.

1624
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:38,339
He has to speak to you.

1625
01:51:40,885 --> 01:51:41,977
Dada.
Yes.

1626
01:51:42,887 --> 01:51:46,152
Greetings... greetings. Greetings
to all of you.

1627
01:51:48,993 --> 01:51:52,759
Today I'm going to tell
you about micro credit...

1628
01:51:52,831 --> 01:51:56,858
...that is the scheme of small loans.

1629
01:51:59,771 --> 01:52:02,069
A woman used to live in the
neighboring district.

1630
01:52:02,407 --> 01:52:03,840
Safia Khatoon.

1631
01:52:05,844 --> 01:52:08,904
She used to make cane furniture.

1632
01:52:10,882 --> 01:52:12,179
She was twenty two years old.

1633
01:52:12,917 --> 01:52:15,078
But she seemed to
be forty years old.

1634
01:52:18,823 --> 01:52:20,916
She used to be busy working
for the whole week.

1635
01:52:23,862 --> 01:52:25,386
Whatever article she used to make...

1636
01:52:25,797 --> 01:52:27,526
...she had to sell it to
the money lender.

1637
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:30,791
'Because, he used to give money...

1638
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:33,167
...for purchasing raw materials.'

1639
01:52:35,173 --> 01:52:36,470
She used to pay 10 rupees per day...

1640
01:52:37,809 --> 01:52:40,835
...and 3 thousand rupees
per year as interest.

1641
01:52:42,213 --> 01:52:43,737
'10 rupees per day and 3 thousand...

1642
01:52:43,815 --> 01:52:46,147
...rupees per year as interest.'

1643
01:52:47,385 --> 01:52:49,751
The woman who worked
so hard was in...

1644
01:52:49,788 --> 01:52:53,246
...this situation because the bank
didn't give her a loan.

1645
01:52:54,859 --> 01:52:58,761
Well, the bank gives loans
only to those...

1646
01:52:58,830 --> 01:53:01,458
...who have something
for mortgaging.

1647
01:53:03,034 --> 01:53:06,765
With the micro credit scheme,
she was given...

1648
01:53:06,838 --> 01:53:08,897
...a small loan of 1 thousand rupees.

1649
01:53:09,841 --> 01:53:12,366
And her income rose by 7 times.

1650
01:53:14,145 --> 01:53:17,876
A few days ago I went to meet her...

1651
01:53:18,449 --> 01:53:19,916
...she was not at work.

1652
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:22,780
She was standing outside a school...

1653
01:53:22,821 --> 01:53:25,915
...holding hands of her four
years old daughter.

1654
01:53:30,094 --> 01:53:32,790
That day for the first
time, someone...

1655
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:49,741
It is the job of landlords
and money lenders...

1656
01:53:49,814 --> 01:53:51,907
...to keep the farmers in the dark.

1657
01:53:52,984 --> 01:53:55,748
In this scheme loan is
given not to make...

1658
01:53:55,787 --> 01:53:58,847
...you people slaves;
but to set you free.

1659
01:53:59,157 --> 01:54:01,751
And actually when the woman
at home starts working...

1660
01:54:01,826 --> 01:54:04,454
...then the household changes,
the village changes.

1661
01:54:05,063 --> 01:54:08,430
People become happy. Isn't it?
Yes... yes, right.

1662
01:54:08,499 --> 01:54:13,493
Any farmer, or his wife,
any artisan or his wife...

1663
01:54:14,272 --> 01:54:16,240
...can take loan from this scheme.

1664
01:54:16,307 --> 01:54:17,865
Without any mortgage.

1665
01:54:18,509 --> 01:54:21,205
And could save their family
members from dying.

1666
01:54:23,848 --> 01:54:27,909
Whoever wants loan, give
your name to the chief.

1667
01:54:28,219 --> 01:54:31,086
Or to me. We...

1668
01:54:46,738 --> 01:54:49,798
Hey!

1669
01:54:54,312 --> 01:54:58,112
Make way for me!

1670
01:55:04,355 --> 01:55:07,415
'Today you had to flee; so
you thought you'll die.'

1671
01:55:07,759 --> 01:55:10,125
'What are you saying, sir? '
'You were ahead of all.'

1672
01:55:10,328 --> 01:55:13,058
'Yeah, man.' You're quite fit, dude.

1673
01:55:19,971 --> 01:55:23,407
Hi, brother.
What are you doing with this man?

1674
01:55:25,510 --> 01:55:27,000
Hey Butter, we were just trying to...

1675
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:30,438
We'll talk later.

1676
01:55:38,756 --> 01:55:39,882
Listen, Dr. Jadhav.

1677
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:44,724
If by this charade of corruption...

1678
01:55:44,796 --> 01:55:47,993
...you want to become Robin
Hood; then it's fine.

1679
01:55:49,801 --> 01:55:52,895
But do not involve my friends
in all this. Hmm?

1680
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:59,469
I'm not involving them. They
are getting involved.

1681
01:55:59,744 --> 01:56:00,802
Cut this rubbish!

1682
01:56:04,749 --> 01:56:07,343
You lied to Vishakha and
took her to Wagh's house.

1683
01:56:08,186 --> 01:56:09,380
'Put her life in danger.'

1684
01:56:10,088 --> 01:56:11,146
Why?

1685
01:56:13,825 --> 01:56:15,884
Five to ten people
die here in a week.

1686
01:56:18,029 --> 01:56:19,326
Shankhya can save them.

1687
01:56:22,166 --> 01:56:24,259
Shankhya's life is most
valuable for me.

1688
01:56:25,303 --> 01:56:28,761
For him I can put my life,
Vishakha's life...

1689
01:56:28,840 --> 01:56:30,899
...everybody's life in danger.

1690
01:56:33,444 --> 01:56:38,438
Look, you are a doctor;
all this is not your job.

1691
01:56:41,853 --> 01:56:43,821
I'm not being able
to do my job.

1692
01:56:46,157 --> 01:56:48,387
I too want to treat like
a general doctor.

1693
01:56:50,795 --> 01:56:55,960
But the wounds are very deep.
Medicines can't cure them.

1694
01:56:58,836 --> 01:57:01,737
More people die in pain
than the number...

1695
01:57:01,806 --> 01:57:04,240
...of people I save with medicines...

1696
01:57:07,745 --> 01:57:11,272
Shankhya can save them;
so I am saving him.

1697
01:57:15,086 --> 01:57:21,252
Yes... I made one mistake.
I lied to Vishakha; I apologise.

1698
01:57:26,764 --> 01:57:28,994
I won't apologise for anything
else I'm doing.

1699
01:57:43,347 --> 01:57:44,814
He didn't do anything wrong, Rahul.

1700
01:57:45,883 --> 01:57:46,941
We needed to save Shankhya.

1701
01:57:47,251 --> 01:57:50,914
What did he do right? What
did he do right!

1702
01:57:53,324 --> 01:57:54,951
Buddy, this is neither our problem...

1703
01:57:55,726 --> 01:57:57,717
...and nor do we have any
solution for this.

1704
01:57:57,795 --> 01:57:58,921
I don't agree with you, Rahul.

1705
01:57:59,831 --> 01:58:02,732
That day we'd have...
rather I'd have given...

1706
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:04,734
...a little hole to Digambar...

1707
01:58:04,802 --> 01:58:05,962
...then perhaps he wouldn't
have died.

1708
01:58:07,038 --> 01:58:10,997
This is not our world, Kats.
We belong elsewhere.

1709
01:58:13,811 --> 01:58:15,073
Guys, please!

1710
01:58:18,483 --> 01:58:20,747
We need to get out of
here before we...

1711
01:58:20,785 --> 01:58:22,343
...get into deep trouble.

1712
01:58:27,091 --> 01:58:28,149
Are you with me?

1713
01:58:32,830 --> 01:58:33,888
Are you with me?

1714
01:58:55,820 --> 01:58:57,048
Rahul, I'll come with you.

1715
01:59:01,726 --> 01:59:02,818
The bandage will be
taken out in 2 days.

1716
01:59:02,894 --> 01:59:03,986
Keel taking medicines, okay?

1717
01:59:04,729 --> 01:59:06,060
She's going to be okay I think.

1718
01:59:06,130 --> 01:59:07,859
Needs to continue with the pain
killers, the anti biotic.

1719
01:59:07,932 --> 01:59:09,024
Hmm?
I'll look into it.

1720
01:59:09,734 --> 01:59:11,998
It's time for his medicine;
give him medicine.

1721
01:59:12,803 --> 01:59:13,861
Move back a little.

1722
01:59:17,742 --> 01:59:18,834
Breathe deeply.

1723
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:25,306
Look... loss of another 20 thousand.

1724
01:59:26,083 --> 01:59:28,074
The creels have to give
the certificate for free.

1725
01:59:28,953 --> 01:59:32,150
No, sir; we too are
part of Vishakha's scheme.

1726
01:59:33,090 --> 01:59:34,955
Will give money and will
work as well. Hmm.

1727
01:59:36,260 --> 01:59:41,391
You are the first doctors who
are giving fees not taking it.

1728
01:59:59,250 --> 02:00:01,775
This vehicle will take you to
the next district. Hmm.

1729
02:00:01,819 --> 02:00:03,377
Then board a bus from there.
Thank you.

1730
02:00:03,421 --> 02:00:04,820
Thank you so much.
Okay.

1731
02:00:04,889 --> 02:00:07,221
One of my men is with you.
Didn't I tell you?

1732
02:00:07,291 --> 02:00:08,883
That's okay.

1733
02:00:18,803 --> 02:00:21,169
Come, brother.
Shall we?

1734
02:00:21,239 --> 02:00:22,297
Proceed.

1735
02:00:37,154 --> 02:00:40,123
'Rahul! Come on, man you
can't leave! ' Bye, guys!

1736
02:00:40,324 --> 02:00:42,417
'Rahul, think about it! '
Stop... stop.

1737
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:44,259
Dude, why are you going?
Thanks for the bag.

1738
02:00:45,496 --> 02:00:48,431
Bhagani, I'll keep two
chilled for you, brother.

1739
02:01:03,848 --> 02:01:08,911
I thought... let's try to work
out this relationship again.

1740
02:01:15,126 --> 02:01:18,892
Who is he? The chief's friend;
going to the other district.

1741
02:01:21,799 --> 02:01:26,498
Where are you going? I told you.
I'm going to the next district.

1742
02:01:30,875 --> 02:01:34,311
Shankhya; right?
Hello?

1743
02:01:35,012 --> 02:01:39,949
Fantastic. So you are the
rescuer of these people.

1744
02:01:41,752 --> 02:01:45,347
And you think this scheme...
micro credit...

1745
02:01:46,824 --> 02:01:47,950
...whatever you call it, will work?

1746
02:01:49,894 --> 02:01:52,920
Wherever I have worked till today,
it has helped there.

1747
02:01:53,964 --> 02:01:56,330
Now I'll invest that money
in this district.

1748
02:01:57,335 --> 02:02:00,270
It's so good. Earns profit as well.

1749
02:02:01,205 --> 02:02:02,968
Then why don't other people
come into this?

1750
02:02:04,775 --> 02:02:06,402
It's good you at least
ask questions.

1751
02:02:07,845 --> 02:02:09,779
Otherwise the youth of these days...

1752
02:02:09,847 --> 02:02:10,939
...have stopped asking questions.

1753
02:02:11,515 --> 02:02:14,211
Please, man. Don't patronize me.

1754
02:02:16,387 --> 02:02:20,255
It works, that's what I said.
I didn't say it's easy.

1755
02:02:22,793 --> 02:02:24,784
The profits come because the
poor also happen...

1756
02:02:24,862 --> 02:02:26,193
...to be self-respecting.

1757
02:02:28,065 --> 02:02:31,899
And the motive is to give
better life to people.

1758
02:02:32,803 --> 02:02:34,737
You really think that...
that you can...

1759
02:02:34,805 --> 02:02:36,830
...change the life of these people?

1760
02:02:38,075 --> 02:02:39,372
At least we can try.

1761
02:02:42,012 --> 02:02:45,175
And then... this is one way.

1762
02:02:45,416 --> 02:02:47,884
Those with other ideas
will also come.

1763
02:02:49,453 --> 02:02:53,150
I got this idea after ruining people
in the chitfund business.

1764
02:02:54,425 --> 02:02:57,360
In fact for the law,
I'm still an offender.

1765
02:02:58,396 --> 02:03:00,921
If a criminal can think like this...

1766
02:03:02,233 --> 02:03:05,896
...then think, good people will
come with even better thoughts.

1767
02:03:06,036 --> 02:03:12,942
They will come... here!
All this is insanity.

1768
02:03:13,844 --> 02:03:14,970
Insanity is needed.

1769
02:03:16,847 --> 02:03:19,145
Just think. If man had not
thought of flying...

1770
02:03:20,017 --> 02:03:21,780
...then people wouldn't have
been travelling...

1771
02:03:21,819 --> 02:03:24,083
...in planes today. Isn't it?

1772
02:03:26,891 --> 02:03:28,859
And you people are
the most insane.

1773
02:03:29,927 --> 02:03:32,828
Everyone says that life and
death is in the hands of God.

1774
02:03:33,898 --> 02:03:35,957
But you doctors are
not ready to agree.

1775
02:03:37,001 --> 02:03:38,935
'Since ages you
are saving people.'

1776
02:03:40,971 --> 02:03:42,029
Why?

1777
02:04:00,491 --> 02:04:04,359
'Oh damn. Put it off. Duck.
Duck... duck... duck! '

1778
02:04:05,095 --> 02:04:07,859
Come out... come.
Go down, come on. Go down.

1779
02:04:07,965 --> 02:04:10,195
Duck... duck! Get down... get down!

1780
02:04:12,269 --> 02:04:16,899
Come on, yes. Duck.
Hey! Stop, Sankhya!

1781
02:04:19,243 --> 02:04:20,505
Don't run, Sankhya!

1782
02:04:22,112 --> 02:04:23,170
'Quickly.'

1783
02:04:24,281 --> 02:04:25,339
Come on.

1784
02:04:27,985 --> 02:04:30,419
Come on, run!

1785
02:04:48,739 --> 02:04:49,831
Sankhya!

1786
02:04:54,011 --> 02:04:57,037
Why are they firing?
They're goons of Ramoji and Wagh.

1787
02:04:58,415 --> 02:04:59,473
Hey!

1788
02:05:01,785 --> 02:05:03,446
I ... I'm Sankhya speaking!

1789
02:05:03,888 --> 02:05:06,823
Speak, son... speak! Speak
for the last time!

1790
02:05:06,891 --> 02:05:10,224
Look, two medical students
are with me; let them go!

1791
02:05:10,294 --> 02:05:13,491
They are not at fault!
Put conditions later, scoundrel!

1792
02:05:14,365 --> 02:05:16,833
First show your face!
I'm coming!

1793
02:05:16,934 --> 02:05:20,893
What are you doing? It's better
that one dies rather than three die.

1794
02:05:21,772 --> 02:05:23,399
But what's the guarantee
that they will leave us?

1795
02:05:24,208 --> 02:05:25,903
There is no guarantee of anything.

1796
02:05:26,944 --> 02:05:29,003
That's why I do not take
guarantee from people.

1797
02:05:29,980 --> 02:05:31,345
I just keep taking chances.

1798
02:05:31,515 --> 02:05:37,112
And anyways... I've started
this fight. Leave.

1799
02:05:37,922 --> 02:05:41,949
Sankhya... what are you
doing! Hey listen.

1800
02:05:54,071 --> 02:05:55,868
Run... run... run... run!

1801
02:05:56,740 --> 02:05:57,900
'Rahul! '

1802
02:06:06,183 --> 02:06:07,241
Shankhya dada.

1803
02:06:10,154 --> 02:06:12,054
Shankhya dada... Shankhya dada,
are you all right?

1804
02:06:12,089 --> 02:06:13,818
Shankhya dada... Shankhya dada...

1805
02:06:38,816 --> 02:06:41,717
The operation is very difficult.
I'll need any one...

1806
02:06:41,752 --> 02:06:45,813
...of you who has some
knowledge of surgery.

1807
02:06:48,993 --> 02:06:50,961
Well we...
l can assist you.

1808
02:07:03,273 --> 02:07:04,900
l will assist you.

1809
02:07:17,788 --> 02:07:23,283
"We have awakened after ages."

1810
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:30,129
"The message of the reality
has awoken us."

1811
02:07:30,968 --> 02:07:36,873
"The spark was lying dormant
in the heart."

1812
02:07:36,940 --> 02:07:43,903
"The storm of time blew
and it got ignited."

1813
02:07:44,348 --> 02:07:49,945
"Heaven also is situated on land."

1814
02:07:50,020 --> 02:07:57,290
"The difference in outlook
made heaven visible."

1815
02:07:57,828 --> 02:08:05,735
"God is within oneself
that he showed...

1816
02:08:05,803 --> 02:08:11,469
...the new manner of veneration."

1817
02:08:16,980 --> 02:08:18,038
Good.

1818
02:08:19,883 --> 02:08:23,944
There's magic in your hands.
Beginners luck.

1819
02:08:24,755 --> 02:08:32,753
"Youth was passing in vain,
the love and passion...

1820
02:08:39,169 --> 02:08:40,261
Dude.
Hey... hey!

1821
02:08:40,337 --> 02:08:44,967
Guys, hoist me. Mother T!
Come on, let's celebrate!

1822
02:08:45,776 --> 02:08:47,710
"Taught in a moment."
The people who don't let...

1823
02:08:47,778 --> 02:08:50,872
...change happen in the right way...

1824
02:08:50,981 --> 02:08:54,007
...compel us to
bring in rebellion.

1825
02:08:54,351 --> 02:08:56,342
If the government won't do anything
for the people...

1826
02:08:56,420 --> 02:08:57,944
...then the government should
be turned upside down.

1827
02:08:58,021 --> 02:09:00,080
And people should take the
lower in their hands.

1828
02:09:01,892 --> 02:09:03,723
Before giving the lower
in the hands of the people...

1829
02:09:03,794 --> 02:09:07,059
...they have to be taught
how is it used.

1830
02:09:08,799 --> 02:09:10,289
Otherwise anarchy will break loose.

1831
02:09:10,834 --> 02:09:12,734
While the government, the money
lender has the...

1832
02:09:12,803 --> 02:09:14,168
...right to indulge in violence,
the farmer doesn't have it.

1833
02:09:14,805 --> 02:09:16,864
We believe in tit for tat.

1834
02:09:17,107 --> 02:09:19,735
If situations don't change then
this violence will get out...

1835
02:09:19,810 --> 02:09:22,176
...of these limitations and
directly reach big cities.

1836
02:09:22,279 --> 02:09:23,746
And it will cross through the malls...

1837
02:09:23,814 --> 02:09:25,805
...multiplexes and bungalows there.

1838
02:09:25,883 --> 02:09:27,077
So you set the country on fire.

1839
02:09:28,185 --> 02:09:29,846
If you cannot change it, erase it!

1840
02:09:30,754 --> 02:09:31,778
'Hey! '
'No, guys.'

1841
02:09:31,855 --> 02:09:33,846
'Come on... come on... come on.'
'l can't drink.'

1842
02:09:33,924 --> 02:09:35,949
l can't drink, buddy.
You have to make...

1843
02:09:36,026 --> 02:09:37,288
What do you mean I can't drink?
Come on, man.

1844
02:09:37,761 --> 02:09:39,922
Come on.
Okay once.

1845
02:09:48,405 --> 02:09:52,307
What are you looking at?
A sparkle in your eyes...

1846
02:09:53,277 --> 02:09:56,337
...that I've never seen before.
What?

1847
02:09:57,781 --> 02:09:59,146
The determination of doing something.

1848
02:10:00,317 --> 02:10:01,784
That Rahul who went inside the...

1849
02:10:01,819 --> 02:10:05,380
...operation theatre,
didn't come out.

1850
02:10:08,525 --> 02:10:12,962
Hmm. Something has changed.

1851
02:10:18,535 --> 02:10:20,230
Not because both of
our lives got saved.

1852
02:10:23,207 --> 02:10:24,799
Not even because that
I think saving...

1853
02:10:24,875 --> 02:10:27,435
...Sankhya's life is
any big achievement.

1854
02:10:31,348 --> 02:10:37,150
But because...
what I did with Prakash...

1855
02:10:40,157 --> 02:10:42,489
...l believe it's the biggest
mistake of my life.

1856
02:10:44,761 --> 02:10:46,353
Prakash?
Hmm.

1857
02:10:50,133 --> 02:10:55,901
The chief, Sankhya; whatever
they are doing...

1858
02:10:56,840 --> 02:10:58,102
...he too was doing the same.

1859
02:10:59,176 --> 02:11:01,041
'He was trying to bring in a change.'

1860
02:11:02,913 --> 02:11:05,143
Without thinking whether that
change would come or not.

1861
02:11:10,787 --> 02:11:11,981
These people just study a lot.

1862
02:11:15,325 --> 02:11:16,952
And do what is supposed
to be done.

1863
02:11:20,797 --> 02:11:22,094
Prakash too was doing the same.

1864
02:11:26,136 --> 02:11:27,262
But I stopped him.

1865
02:11:36,747 --> 02:11:38,738
My supporting everyone here,
is an endeavor...

1866
02:11:38,815 --> 02:11:41,283
...to make Prakash win again.

1867
02:11:51,094 --> 02:12:01,368
"Sweetheart, you are the
light of my eyes."

1868
02:12:01,772 --> 02:12:08,769
"Sweetheart, I am the
light...

1869
02:12:08,845 --> 02:12:17,480
...of your love."

1870
02:12:17,821 --> 02:12:25,887
"Sweetheart, sweetheart..."

1871
02:12:26,229 --> 02:12:35,001
"Sweetheart, sweetheart!"

1872
02:12:35,806 --> 02:12:38,900
'Ramu! Ramu.'

1873
02:12:49,353 --> 02:12:50,377
'Ra...

1874
02:12:56,193 --> 02:12:59,321
'Ramu? Ramu! '

1875
02:13:13,010 --> 02:13:14,136
We must be careful, guys.

1876
02:13:14,277 --> 02:13:15,767
Wagh and his men should
not come to know...

1877
02:13:15,846 --> 02:13:16,904
...that Shankhya is in hospital.

1878
02:13:17,114 --> 02:13:19,378
Don't worry, Butter; we'll
take care of it.

1879
02:14:03,060 --> 02:14:07,929
Did you see... what you
people have started?

1880
02:14:11,401 --> 02:14:18,034
We didn't do anything. This
just happened. Hmm.

1881
02:14:20,243 --> 02:14:23,770
Well it got started that very
day, when you people...

1882
02:14:23,847 --> 02:14:27,010
...fled the university elections
and came here.

1883
02:14:42,165 --> 02:14:43,223
'Yes, give.'

1884
02:14:43,333 --> 02:14:45,801
'Here, yes.'

1885
02:14:50,040 --> 02:14:51,871
Hmm. Greetings.
Greetings.

1886
02:14:52,742 --> 02:14:53,834
Come on hurry up.

1887
02:14:53,910 --> 02:14:56,242
'Thank you, master.'
'God will bless you.'

1888
02:14:56,313 --> 02:14:59,749
For God sake, give me something.
Here. God will bless you.

1889
02:14:59,783 --> 02:15:01,182
Sir. What's it?
Mr. Wagh has come.

1890
02:15:01,785 --> 02:15:03,946
Hmm. I know.

1891
02:15:05,989 --> 02:15:07,115
Here.

1892
02:15:08,458 --> 02:15:11,985
'Bread... give me bread.'
'Give me too.'

1893
02:15:13,830 --> 02:15:16,025
Greetings, Mr. Wagh... greetings.

1894
02:15:16,099 --> 02:15:17,862
Tell me, how may I serve you?

1895
02:15:17,934 --> 02:15:21,062
When you've to take it then
you stand at our door.

1896
02:15:21,204 --> 02:15:23,104
And when it's time to
give then you keep us out...

1897
02:15:23,173 --> 02:15:25,903
Mr. Wagh, it's the house
of the Lord.

1898
02:15:26,276 --> 02:15:29,006
Everyone has to wait here. Hey.

1899
02:15:29,846 --> 02:15:35,341
Look, today it's your turn
to take, because your son...

1900
02:15:36,820 --> 02:15:41,086
...is angry; keep him tied, hmm?
What did you say?

1901
02:15:41,725 --> 02:15:44,159
Sankhya and his goons
almost got him killed!

1902
02:15:44,227 --> 02:15:46,957
This is provoking
the villagers further. Hmm?

1903
02:15:47,097 --> 02:15:48,291
Today they're standing against you.

1904
02:15:49,132 --> 02:15:50,929
Tomorrow they'll stand
against the government.

1905
02:15:52,002 --> 02:15:53,094
Government?

1906
02:15:54,171 --> 02:15:56,731
So the government that
we kept feeding...

1907
02:15:56,806 --> 02:15:59,036
...the same government
will stand against us!

1908
02:15:59,809 --> 02:16:01,003
Oh wow, government!

1909
02:16:01,845 --> 02:16:03,813
Better than this we'd
have fed dogs!

1910
02:16:07,150 --> 02:16:12,247
Mr. Wagh, be calm. Look, the
matter could still be solved.

1911
02:16:12,923 --> 02:16:17,383
Do one thing. You don't touch
Sankhya yourself.

1912
02:16:19,095 --> 02:16:21,325
Lodge an F.l .R. with the
police against him.

1913
02:16:22,132 --> 02:16:23,429
That he is an ally of the rebels.

1914
02:16:24,834 --> 02:16:26,233
And he engineered
this attack as well.

1915
02:16:29,306 --> 02:16:32,969
Then watch. The government
will send the police.

1916
02:16:33,777 --> 02:16:38,373
And why just the police? It will
send the military as well. For you.

1917
02:16:58,802 --> 02:17:02,898
Madam, Mr. Wagh has come.
Send him in.

1918
02:17:03,807 --> 02:17:05,035
He has summoned you.

1919
02:17:15,352 --> 02:17:16,376
Greetings, madam.

1920
02:17:17,153 --> 02:17:20,816
That Sankhya has beaten and
left my son half dead...

1921
02:17:20,890 --> 02:17:22,915
...and has killed the others.

1922
02:17:26,296 --> 02:17:29,322
l too have heard something.
About last night.

1923
02:17:29,499 --> 02:17:31,763
Madam, it seems that Sankhya...

1924
02:17:31,835 --> 02:17:34,429
...has his own gang here.

1925
02:17:35,772 --> 02:17:37,137
Did I ask you anything?

1926
02:17:37,440 --> 02:17:39,704
Hey, madam not just this;
he is engineering...

1927
02:17:39,776 --> 02:17:42,836
...riots in the village.
He is misleading people!

1928
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:45,813
He is the ally of the rebellions!
Thousands are there.

1929
02:17:46,349 --> 02:17:50,308
Outside the hospital, outside
the circuit house! Come and see!

1930
02:17:51,755 --> 02:17:55,088
Tambe, start the investigation.
'Yes, madam.'

1931
02:17:55,725 --> 02:17:59,058
Let me know what the truth is.
Hey; what do you mean?

1932
02:17:59,729 --> 02:18:01,959
Am I lying then?
I'm saying the truth!

1933
02:18:02,465 --> 02:18:04,433
Even the D.l .G. has heard the truth!

1934
02:18:05,035 --> 02:18:08,163
'I will call him right now.'
Hey, Rane. 'Yes? '

1935
02:18:08,338 --> 02:18:09,828
Connect the phone!
Yes, sir.

1936
02:18:15,812 --> 02:18:19,475
Sir, phone.
Hello?

1937
02:18:20,850 --> 02:18:24,251
D.p .G., sir, greetings.
I've come to her.

1938
02:18:26,256 --> 02:18:28,747
She is saying investigation
will be needed, sir.

1939
02:18:28,825 --> 02:18:30,850
'Give the phone to the D.S.P.'
Yes, sir.

1940
02:18:40,003 --> 02:18:41,061
Sir?

1941
02:18:46,042 --> 02:18:48,704
Hello? 'Brother, hey brother, the
police are coming...

1942
02:18:48,778 --> 02:18:50,177
...to arrest Sankhya.'
What?

1943
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:55,215
'Go fast and inform the chief... go.'
Oh. Yes... yes I will.

1944
02:20:11,461 --> 02:20:12,519
Remove everyone!

1945
02:20:17,867 --> 02:20:18,925
Hey, come on.

1946
02:20:49,165 --> 02:20:50,223
Go and bring Sankhya.

1947
02:21:02,445 --> 02:21:04,106
'Come on, move aside! '

1948
02:21:12,388 --> 02:21:13,946
I say get aside!

1949
02:21:18,394 --> 02:21:19,452
Come on!

1950
02:21:25,902 --> 02:21:26,960
'Come on... come on...'

1951
02:21:28,271 --> 02:21:29,329
'Go.'

1952
02:21:57,467 --> 02:22:00,834
Are you with those boys?
Ah...

1953
02:22:02,138 --> 02:22:03,503
Where did your friends go?

1954
02:22:04,374 --> 02:22:05,773
Where did your friends go!

1955
02:22:22,859 --> 02:22:23,917
'Hey... hey! '

1956
02:23:07,370 --> 02:23:10,237
Dada. Dada, are you all right?
Yes.

1957
02:23:11,874 --> 02:23:14,434
I'll find the boatman;
you people wait here.

1958
02:23:21,284 --> 02:23:25,380
Priyanka would be alone there.
May I go to hospital?

1959
02:23:25,421 --> 02:23:26,479
Yes you go.

1960
02:23:27,790 --> 02:23:28,882
Hey guys, all take care, okay?

1961
02:23:39,068 --> 02:23:42,128
Uncle, where is your son?
Not at home.

1962
02:23:52,148 --> 02:23:55,140
Mr. Doctor, another boatman lives
nearby; let's go to him.

1963
02:23:56,352 --> 02:23:58,980
You go I'll be here; come
on, go on! Yes... yes.

1964
02:23:59,055 --> 02:24:00,147
Are you sure?
Yes.

1965
02:24:00,223 --> 02:24:02,418
Rahul, go.
Keel a check on him.

1966
02:24:02,492 --> 02:24:03,754
Yeah.
Come... come.

1967
02:24:03,826 --> 02:24:04,884
Come on.

1968
02:24:06,162 --> 02:24:10,428
'How long was Sankhya here? '
He was not here.

1969
02:24:12,769 --> 02:24:14,862
Just now you said that you
don't know who he is.

1970
02:24:16,839 --> 02:24:20,240
Where is the doctor?
I don't know.

1971
02:24:22,245 --> 02:24:23,837
Hey, come on; stand here! You too!

1972
02:24:23,913 --> 02:24:24,971
Kats...
Hmm!

1973
02:24:29,318 --> 02:24:33,049
This girl was here; you
both came from outside.

1974
02:24:34,057 --> 02:24:35,115
Where is Sankhya!

1975
02:25:05,988 --> 02:25:07,080
Creels got away.

1976
02:25:11,427 --> 02:25:12,758
So many times I explained
to my father that you creel...

1977
02:25:12,829 --> 02:25:15,229
...policemen would never be
able to do anyone's job.

1978
02:25:16,332 --> 02:25:18,027
Got the scoundrels flee
from the hospital!

1979
02:25:19,836 --> 02:25:22,236
We are searching. We'll
find... we'll find.

1980
02:25:22,305 --> 02:25:24,500
My foot we'll find... we'll
find... we'll find!

1981
02:25:25,875 --> 02:25:29,072
'Would you just stand here
or go forward and see! '

1982
02:25:29,145 --> 02:25:30,203
'Yes I'm going.'

1983
02:25:50,867 --> 02:25:52,994
'Hello, madam nobody is found yet.'

1984
02:25:53,069 --> 02:25:54,400
'You'll be informed
as soon as we find.'

1985
02:25:54,470 --> 02:25:56,199
'We are looking for them.'
'Over and out.'

1986
02:25:59,175 --> 02:26:02,144
'One who'll say first where
Sankhya is; will be freed.'

1987
02:26:04,914 --> 02:26:08,042
The rest I'll arrest considering
them accomplices!

1988
02:26:08,384 --> 02:26:10,147
You cannot interrogate us like this.

1989
02:26:10,753 --> 02:26:12,186
We've the right to call a lawyer.
'Hmm... hmm.'

1990
02:26:13,356 --> 02:26:16,757
Tambe, till they call
a lawyer, get...

1991
02:26:16,826 --> 02:26:19,954
...this girl to speak everything.
No.

1992
02:26:20,163 --> 02:26:21,755
Yes, madam.
Bhagani, Kats...

1993
02:26:21,831 --> 02:26:22,889
Hey, come!
Bhagani, please!

1994
02:26:22,965 --> 02:26:24,091
What are you doing!
We told you, ma'am!

1995
02:26:24,167 --> 02:26:25,759
Please, let go of me!
Ma'am, don't do this!

1996
02:26:25,835 --> 02:26:27,393
Come on!
What are you doing! Hey stop!

1997
02:26:29,038 --> 02:26:31,802
Answer to what I asked you. Speak!

1998
02:26:37,380 --> 02:26:39,746
It doesn't seem this witch
will answer so easily.

1999
02:26:39,849 --> 02:26:42,113
What are you saying, brother?
I'm here.

2000
02:26:54,397 --> 02:26:56,058
'Say! ' 'Where is Sankhya, tell me! '

2001
02:26:56,132 --> 02:26:57,394
What the hell is this?
You cannot do this!

2002
02:26:57,466 --> 02:26:59,058
Ma'am, please!
Please, she's a girl!

2003
02:26:59,135 --> 02:27:01,069
Don't do this let's just...
Kats, we've got to do something.

2004
02:27:01,804 --> 02:27:03,328
You creel!
Get back!

2005
02:27:03,406 --> 02:27:08,070
Shut up!
Kats! Kats... Kats! You creel!

2006
02:27:10,246 --> 02:27:12,737
Stop it! Stop it!
Goddamn it please!

2007
02:27:15,785 --> 02:27:16,843
I will tell you!

2008
02:27:17,053 --> 02:27:22,423
'Sit... sit! ' 'Sit! '
Tambe, stop.

2009
02:27:49,151 --> 02:27:51,051
'Rascal! '
'Hey! '

2010
02:27:52,922 --> 02:27:53,980
You creel!

2011
02:27:55,391 --> 02:27:56,449
What are you doing, man!

2012
02:28:08,738 --> 02:28:10,399
'Mr. Wagh... Mr. Wagh! '

2013
02:28:26,389 --> 02:28:27,481
Vishu...

2014
02:28:33,829 --> 02:28:34,887
Rahul!

2015
02:28:36,766 --> 02:28:40,896
I'm coming, I'll come.
Vishu, I'm coming.

2016
02:28:40,970 --> 02:28:42,096
I'll come... I'll come.

2017
02:28:55,051 --> 02:28:56,109
Rahul!

2018
02:29:00,389 --> 02:29:03,324
Come on, lick him. Yes.

2019
02:29:04,727 --> 02:29:05,785
'Careful.'

2020
02:29:17,406 --> 02:29:21,342
You go. Come on.
'Nandu, hurry up.'

2021
02:29:22,211 --> 02:29:23,269
'Hurry up! '

2022
02:29:47,837 --> 02:29:50,169
'Chief! Chief! '

2023
02:29:53,242 --> 02:29:55,767
'Mr. Doctor, you jump... you jump! '

2024
02:29:57,013 --> 02:29:58,071
Chief!

2025
02:30:01,417 --> 02:30:02,509
'Chief, jump! '

2026
02:30:03,185 --> 02:30:05,881
'You all go this side.'
Tambe, go that side.

2027
02:30:27,543 --> 02:30:29,875
Rahul, what happened, man?

2028
02:30:30,913 --> 02:30:32,380
T! Mother T!

2029
02:30:38,054 --> 02:30:39,078
'Oh God! '

2030
02:30:41,857 --> 02:30:43,950
'What happened to her! ' 'Rahul? '

2031
02:30:44,326 --> 02:30:45,418
Rahul, is she hurt?

2032
02:30:50,366 --> 02:30:51,958
God damn it what happened to her!

2033
02:30:52,034 --> 02:30:53,365
She's losing a lot of blood.

2034
02:30:53,836 --> 02:30:57,101
Sister... No cuts in this...

2035
02:30:57,840 --> 02:30:59,330
'Don't worry; nothing
will happen to you.'

2036
02:31:00,042 --> 02:31:03,375
'I didn't tell them about Sankhya.'

2037
02:31:03,813 --> 02:31:05,781
'Vishakha, I'm here with you.'
'I didn't tell anything.'

2038
02:31:05,848 --> 02:31:09,011
'Nothing will happen to you.'
'Nothing.'

2039
02:31:09,118 --> 02:31:11,279
'You're going to be fine.'
She's not going to be fine.

2040
02:31:13,289 --> 02:31:14,483
'Cannot happen here.'

2041
02:31:16,325 --> 02:31:18,225
Have to shift her
to some bigger hospital.

2042
02:31:26,435 --> 02:31:27,493
'Who is this? '

2043
02:31:28,871 --> 02:31:32,807
I will charge Sankhya with
Ramu and...

2044
02:31:37,413 --> 02:31:40,746
And in the report it will
be written that after...

2045
02:31:40,783 --> 02:31:44,776
...killing them all...
Sankhya got killed.

2046
02:31:45,354 --> 02:31:47,015
Neither have they raped Vishakha.

2047
02:31:47,089 --> 02:31:51,185
And nor... nor have you murdered.

2048
02:31:52,828 --> 02:31:54,489
And if I do not accept
this deal then?

2049
02:31:54,830 --> 02:31:56,263
You'll be blown off on the way.

2050
02:31:56,866 --> 02:31:59,300
You could never reach
the magistrate.

2051
02:32:03,005 --> 02:32:04,802
'Now I will offer you a deal.'

2052
02:32:06,075 --> 02:32:07,337
'It's 4 o' clock in the morning.'

2053
02:32:11,780 --> 02:32:15,011
This is our sir... chief.

2054
02:32:16,118 --> 02:32:17,483
This is chief, buddy.

2055
02:32:20,856 --> 02:32:22,847
Why didn't you jump off the boat!

2056
02:32:23,058 --> 02:32:27,324
'Saving Sankhya... was important.'

2057
02:32:27,863 --> 02:32:29,956
'Sankhya is saved? '
'Yes.'

2058
02:32:40,409 --> 02:32:41,808
'What was he blabbering? '

2059
02:32:44,079 --> 02:32:49,278
Sir... Nothing. Was just
telling his name. What?

2060
02:32:52,054 --> 02:32:54,955
Shankar Gaitonde.
Means Sankhya?

2061
02:32:56,225 --> 02:32:57,886
We've knocked down Sankhya!

2062
02:32:57,960 --> 02:33:00,758
Madam... madam we've
knocked down Sankhya!

2063
02:33:03,766 --> 02:33:04,824
Chief was right.

2064
02:33:06,368 --> 02:33:07,426
If Sankhya lives then something...

2065
02:33:07,503 --> 02:33:08,765
...will be left in this region.

2066
02:33:10,906 --> 02:33:12,305
Otherwise everything will
finish like the chief.

2067
02:33:31,860 --> 02:33:33,054
Oh, it's okay.
You'll be fine, babes.

2068
02:33:33,128 --> 02:33:34,254
'You'll be fine.'
'You'll be fine.'

2069
02:33:37,233 --> 02:33:41,397
'This was not your fight; even
then you people joined it.'

2070
02:33:42,404 --> 02:33:45,896
'It was ours; or else it
wouldn't have reached us.'

2071
02:33:57,453 --> 02:34:03,414
I'm sorry, Priyanka.
Sorry? For what?

2072
02:34:06,495 --> 02:34:10,898
For what I'm going to do.

2073
02:34:14,436 --> 02:34:16,233
D.S.P. Kirti?
You'll be okay.

2074
02:34:16,505 --> 02:34:19,770
Rahul. You shouldn't
have said that...

2075
02:34:19,842 --> 02:34:22,470
...l won't reach the magistrate.

2076
02:34:25,047 --> 02:34:31,384
Whenever, wherever I want to go...
l can reach there.

2077
02:34:33,222 --> 02:34:37,716
What are you doing, buddy?
Rahul... what... you?

2078
02:34:40,429 --> 02:34:41,726
Greetings, dad.

2079
02:34:44,733 --> 02:34:48,066
