1
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:15,104
(Radio announcement)

2
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:32,729
Darn you, Chauka!
This is all your fault.

3
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:34,792
Oh, right! There was a race track
here, an hour ago.

4
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,697
Why are you whining?
I'm driving here!

5
00:02:36,756 --> 00:02:39,930
Obviously, you would.
You're almost a Sardaar.

6
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,471
Today, I'm driving on
the way back.

7
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:42,562
Keep dreaming.

8
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,471
When I am drunk,
I only trust myself.

9
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:46,441
And I trust Chauka,
just slightly more than that.

10
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,103
I Wouldn't even let you drive
sober.

11
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,148
Listen, I can drive drunk
better than both of you.

12
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:51,772
Have you lost it?

13
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:53,983
Are you planning
to fly over the traffic?

14
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:55,881
Are people in our country
fools?

15
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:57,353
As if the traffic will
clear just by honking your horn!

16
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,890
He's honking as if the other guy
doesn't want to move on!

17
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,118
I'm hereto settle down and
grow roots, right?

18
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:03,660
I've just decided I am going
to hold up the traffic and stay put.

19
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,060
Why are you hollering?
This is all your fault!

20
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,558
Yes, everything in your life
is my fault, right?

21
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:11,698
Don't mind him. He'll be still
saying the same when he has a kid!

22
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,760
This is all because of you!

23
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,565
Oh, man! Get a move on!

24
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:23,339
<i>Okay.</i>

25
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:27,911
Take the call, buddy.

26
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,079
Speak to aunt,
she must be getting hassled.

27
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:32,453
Forget about it!
She knows where I am.

28
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,717
But still, she has to
call every single day.

29
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,952
Sir. Your call.

30
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,959
Hey? Where? What?

31
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,222
Tell me, quick!
I can't see it!

32
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,854
Hurry up and tell me,
it's got to be Obama!

33
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:41,159
Please, tell me!

34
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:44,462
Awesome!

35
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,871
Loser, why don't you say it
loud enough so they can hear you?

36
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,036
We don't lech like you.
We are admirers.

37
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,410
You fools are going to
be admiring away all your life.

38
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,109
Chauke, the day we really
like some girl...

39
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,981
...and admiration is not enough
We'll go to talk to her.

40
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,384
We'll be loving, polite.
Then, the ball is in her court

41
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:05,683
Right, buddy?

42
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,224
Respect, Chauke.

43
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:08,986
I am more respectful than you!

44
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,050
I have never leched at
a girl so far.

45
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,364
When did you ever
look at girls?

46
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,257
You've been to an only
boys school.

47
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:18,563
Then, you did engineering
where there are hardly any girls.

48
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,433
And the girls who are there
and halfway decent to look at...

49
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,834
...they won't spare you
a second glance!

50
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,498
They are the ones who are
committed, from the word go!

51
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:26,373
Now, you're getting the third degree
in a 4 by 4 cubicle, every day.

52
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:28,335
Sure, why don't you
join the torture squad?

53
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,403
It's a free for all!
Join the club.

54
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:33,082
Free for all?
Isn't the company paying you?

55
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:39,221
Fool, my dad's hounding
me with his MBA chant.

56
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,789
They scam us big time!

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,553
In the tenth grade, they
said, just one more year.

58
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,596
Do that and they say just two
more years. Get through engineering.

59
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,256
Then, they start wailing
about the llTs!

60
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,391
Do the IIT graduates have
wings sprouting out of their backs?

61
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,526
Then, they say, fine, whatever.
Just get a placement.

62
00:04:51,591 --> 00:04:53,298
You're settled! But, nothing doing.
Novv, they want me to do an MBA!

63
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,600
I've been working for four years, now!
I can't go back to school!

64
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,470
If we have relatives over,
there's more to stress out about.

65
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,237
His son joined this place,
his son is working in that place.

66
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,209
They all have a service
class, middle class mentality.

67
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,805
That reminds me.
I'm getting promoted.

68
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:08,249
An increment?
- About 30 percent.

69
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:10,048
God's justice is delayed
and denied, as well!

70
00:05:10,109 --> 00:05:12,214
I do the legwork
and he gets promoted!

71
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,855
Better to have enemies
than a friend like you.

72
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,358
I'm a friend, but I'm human too.

73
00:05:15,415 --> 00:05:17,691
It would hufl watching someone
like him get promoted.

74
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,258
Okay, fine. Congratulations.

75
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,856
Your increment is 30%, right?
You're buying the drinks from today.

76
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,664
What do you mean, from today?
When do you ever pay?

77
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,732
Did you forget who paid
for the snacks, day before?

78
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:31,531
Listen, I work hard for the money.
It's not diriy money, like yours!

79
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:32,871
You can get lost.

80
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,242
I won't spend a penny of my
dirty money of you.

81
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,281
You can used your hard
earned money for liquor.

82
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,006
Yes. And don't let the
loser drive the car, either.

83
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:41,411
Don't stress about that.
I'll drive.

84
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,147
What does that have to
do with the car?

85
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,244
It does. It's a hard earned car.

86
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,953
Either I or Chauka drive
my car, after drinking.

87
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:50,527
Because, he's almost
a Sardaar (Sikh).

88
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,257
Buddy, half a bottle can't
get the party going.

89
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,631
Shame on you!

90
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,526
We haven't even moved
out of the pub, yet.

91
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:00,228
The liquor will turn to water
if it hears you say that.

92
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,101
It's aged for 15 years in some
box in Europe.

93
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,173
And, it doesn't get the
party going, here!

94
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:08,178
If you can't get drunk,
have some water.

95
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:09,713
Why waste good money on it?

96
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,840
Listen, it's got to have
the feel, okay?

97
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:14,111
Sure, order Bisleri
for the right feel.

98
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,550
Why waste good liquor?

99
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,763
"I tell the bartender...

100
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,431
...I'm on a high, all night."

101
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:40,610
"Keep repeating my order."

102
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,177
"Just keep giving me
neat liquor."

103
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,618
"You can go home,
if you want to."

104
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,286
"Just do this for me."

105
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,685
"Just hand over the keys of
the cabinet to me."

106
00:06:55,782 --> 00:07:00,128
"Just give me the keys. It's a one
on one with me and the liquor."

107
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:03,894
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'

108
00:07:03,956 --> 00:07:07,597
"It's a one on one with
me and the liquor."

109
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:11,869
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'

110
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,048
"I just hate it."

111
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:22,882
"I am addicted to drink."

112
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,785
"Everyone tells me
to quit."

113
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:26,948
"This is the work of
the devil."

114
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:29,686
"Everyone drinks,
we just drink a little more."

115
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:32,525
"I just hate it."

116
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,394
"I am addicted to drink."

117
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,263
"Everyone tells me
to quit."

118
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,925
"This is the work of
the devil."

119
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,026
"Everyone will rise up."

120
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,594
"I won't give in."

121
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,538
"I will break the empty bottle."

122
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,405
"I won't turn away from
a drink."

123
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,274
"My friend lives in this alley."

124
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,142
"People love it here."

125
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,078
"I am going to drink
the bottle up."

126
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,582
"And still come back
for more."

127
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,415
"It's a one on one with
me and the liquor."

128
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:00,856
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'

129
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,864
"Yes, I do drink."

130
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,804
"It's the Worst thing to do."

131
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:17,564
"People just sip
on wine."

132
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,244
"I drink, till I lose my
bearings."

133
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,947
"You can go home,
if you want to."

134
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:29,718
"Just do this for me."

135
00:08:29,976 --> 00:08:33,219
"Just hand over the keys of
the cabinet to me."

136
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,659
"It's a one on one with
me and the liquor."

137
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,288
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'

138
00:08:41,387 --> 00:08:45,130
"It's a one on one with
me and the liquor."

139
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:49,570
"No matter how much I hold back,
it won't let me be.'

140
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:02,844
Come on, buddy.

141
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,183
Have you lost it?

142
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:05,551
We have better things to do.

143
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:07,215
Come on, please, bro.
Aren't you my brother?

144
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,623
We just have to stay
for an hour.

145
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,749
You can drink free liquor.

146
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,021
And you complain
that I don't get you drinks.

147
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:12,585
Yes, right. With uncle
and aunt in tow.

148
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:15,393
So, what are they going to do?
I'll be drinking, too.

149
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,902
Come on, buddy.
What will I do alone at the wedding?

150
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,230
You'll shake it.

151
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,900
What are you both
so busy with, anyway?

152
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,235
We didn't say We're busy.

153
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:26,142
There'll be girls, too!

154
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,269
What's the point of me
seeing girls from Meerut?

155
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,812
Imagine that they are
from Delhi and look.

156
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,108
I'll pass. You carry on.

157
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,773
If you find someone,
give her my number.

158
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,213
I'll come along.

159
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,150
But, in his car.
And I'm driving.

160
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:37,886
Are you 'm' insane?

161
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,320
Carry on with the toriure.
See if I come along, next time.

162
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,757
When it comes to you,
you just back off, completely!

163
00:09:42,815 --> 00:09:44,954
You're just acting pricey
since I asked nicely.

164
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,156
And you! Just park that
car of yours, okay?

165
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,030
Come on, bro.
Please?

166
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,502
Chiku!

167
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,273
Oh, my God!
- Your sister-in-law.

168
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:43,683
Where are you going?
- To get me some Chiku.

169
00:10:57,623 --> 00:10:58,795
I'm glad, you dumped him.

170
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,797
What?

171
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:02,804
The one you met by mistake.

172
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:04,770
I'm not available, now.

173
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,173
There's no chance of that, now.

174
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:07,903
Certainly not while I an": alive.

175
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:09,474
So, when are you planning
to die?

176
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,940
Right now. Almost there.

177
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:14,246
Yeah!

178
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,081
Cheers.

179
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,113
981...

180
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:22,690
"I941I"

181
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,327
“.7038.

182
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,992
I forget stuff, when I drink.

183
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:29,623
I am not something
you can forget.

184
00:11:31,957 --> 00:11:33,664
What do you think?
Will she forget?

185
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,080
Let's have a Patiala (drink).

186
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,015
There she is.

187
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,319
Priyanka is coming too.

188
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,418
F' riyanka!

189
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,554
Come on, make some for us, too.

190
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:01,897
Supriya. Kamal.

191
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:02,955
Hi.
- Siddhadh.

192
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,432
Hi.
- Hi.

193
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,265
Varun.
- Hi!

194
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:08,271
How do you want it?
- Half soda, half water.

195
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,597
Down the hatch!
Hurry up!

196
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:11,431
"Sister, your brother-in-law is
insane."

197
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:16,037
"Sister, your brother-in-law is
insane."

198
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:20,669
"Just look at him baiting
the girls!"

199
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:25,044
"Just look at him baiting
the girls!"

200
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:04,316
Yes, morn?

201
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:06,788
I'm on the way.

202
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,388
No,Sidhhar1h's...

203
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,456
I'm with Sidhhadh.

204
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,931
Yes, mom.

205
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,894
Bye. Okay.

206
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,435
I'm done.
You can carry on.

207
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:06,738
Sorry?

208
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:09,072
Oh, no.
You're misunderstanding.

209
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,579
I Wasn't ogling at you.

210
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:14,808
The trainer isn't here. So he asked
me to keep an eye on your form.

211
00:16:17,242 --> 00:16:18,721
So, how was my form?

212
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,284
Well, running was 8 on 10.

213
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:24,488
I mean, it's a sure thing
that eloping...

214
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,652
...running isn't an issue
at all.

215
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,032
Abs, almost nine on ten.

216
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,231
But, I'd advise you
not to do that, too much.

217
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,969
Yes, you could have
a better back.

218
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:36,904
It's a 6 on 10, right now.

219
00:16:37,963 --> 00:16:39,499
Especially at this young age.

220
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:43,243
You really need a strong back.

221
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:48,344
And squats and stretching?
10 on 10.

222
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,115
So, how do I get a ten on
ten in all?

223
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,588
It's not too difficult.

224
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,189
I can work on you...
yourform, till you get 10 on 10.

225
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,755
And what would you
charge for your services?

226
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:03,290
A coffee and a conversation?

227
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,570
Costa?
Five?

228
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:09,433
Do you want to pretend to
have a conversation?

229
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,864
Or, do you really want
to have a conversation?

230
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:15,101
How about seven?
My place?

231
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,246
So, are you going to
tell me your name, or...

232
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:23,547
Tarun.

233
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,080
Kusum.

234
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,306
Here you are.
Take a bitter mouthful.

235
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,845
Did you ever think,
it would come to this?

236
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,586
What happened?
- He found a girl in Meerut.

237
00:17:58,177 --> 00:17:59,588
Are they getting you married?

238
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:01,555
What do you mean that?

239
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:04,355
I found her.
And she asked for my number.

240
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,188
She wanted to get her
data recovered.

241
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,060
That's just an excuse.

242
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,397
And why are you getting
so jealous, loser?

243
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:12,197
You should be happy for me.

244
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,798
Forget about him.

245
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,871
You tell me.
How did you score?

246
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,875
You won't believe it!
I was in great shape, yesterday.

247
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,003
For a moment, I thought she was
ogling me, more than I ogled her.

248
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,604
First, I was boozing with the boys
and she came with her friend.

249
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,013
Then, when I noticed her a bit,
she began to smile.

250
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,483
I met her, even while
I was dancing.

251
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:31,077
I mean, we danced to the
wedding song...

252
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:32,816
...it was like a reel life
moment.

253
00:18:32,911 --> 00:18:34,618
Did you ask her, properly?

254
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:36,750
Whether she's distantly
related to you in some way.

255
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,022
Desperate boys often slip up
like that in weddings.

256
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:40,563
You be quiet.

257
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,027
She's not related, okay?
She was coming to Noida.

258
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,466
So, I said, you don't have to
go alone. I'll drop you home.

259
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,231
It's not safe, you know?

260
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,273
Protection? So you did it from
the point of view of protection?

261
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,742
Then, did you get her to tie a rakhi
and promise to protect her forever?

262
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,577
Gogo, let it go.
This is serious.

263
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,277
So, did you get the hard
disk, while you were at it?

264
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:02,443
'M' you! You're getting
to be just like him.

265
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,849
You can't bear to see me happy.

266
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,014
It's not my fault,
you're not getting any!

267
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,757
The house seems like prison
to me.

268
00:19:07,846 --> 00:19:08,984
It's good, I have Supriya, now.

269
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,891
I was thinking, there's no point
in wasting time with you guys.

270
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,487
I remember all the stuff
dad used to say about you.

271
00:19:14,553 --> 00:19:16,999
Listen, we are happy.
Novv, tell me more.

272
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:18,693
Well, she's coming home
at 4 pm.

273
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,926
To our house?
- Yes, loser! To our house.

274
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,131
The girl calls me up
at 10 am in the morning.

275
00:19:23,228 --> 00:19:26,437
She said, hi, this is Supriya.
Remember me, from last night?

276
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,841
Supriya. Sounds so sweet
just to say it.

277
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,939
It feels as if, Ms. Lata
has sung a ballad.

278
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,244
"It feels, as if...
- Alright, zip it. It's a very sweet name."

279
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:37,480
Don't get addicted to the sugar
or you'll get diabetes.

280
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:40,921
So, tell me.
Did you get a call?

281
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:43,454
Not yet.
- Which call is he expecting?

282
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,287
He's not lagging
too far behind.

283
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,425
He ceriainly gave his number.

284
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:48,760
Didn't he tell you?

285
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,091
I see, so that's it!

286
00:19:51,156 --> 00:19:52,567
How can that loser
tell me about it?

287
00:19:52,624 --> 00:19:55,434
I've set up for a date
and he didn't even get a call!

288
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:59,235
No wonder! He's up early on a
Sunday and touching that phone...

289
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,437
was if Katrina Kaif is about
to pop out of it!

290
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,044
And that's why you're
so jealous, loser!

291
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:05,138
You didn't get a call, and you're
calling my girl, my sister!

292
00:20:05,237 --> 00:20:07,911
Listen, guys like you who pass out
their numbers are a dime a dozen.

293
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,418
Girls don't call up
just like that.

294
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,954
You can take that from me in
writing, you won't get any calls!

295
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,699
Hello?
- I was just checking.

296
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,206
Are you dead yet?
- I was saved.

297
00:20:29,294 --> 00:20:32,366
By me?
- No. By Kiwi and Litchi.

298
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,146
Their names are Ruchi and Tina.

299
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,039
Those are really boring names.

300
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,375
I like a name like Chiku.

301
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,853
Full of juice.
So juicy!

302
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,651
So, what's your name?
Fruity?

303
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,715
Ansh u I.
Get it tattooed.

304
00:20:49,948 --> 00:20:51,552
I've heard, you're
prone to forgetting.

305
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,563
Do you forget to have dinner
or do you forget that too?

306
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,201
Le Bistro Du Pare?

307
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:01,134
See you at 7?
- See you.

308
00:21:04,062 --> 00:21:05,541
So, brothers.

309
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,804
There's no hard disk,
there's no data.

310
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,274
No data recovery, either!

311
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:12,675
When a boy and girl schedule
a meeting without any agenda...

312
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,508
...it's called a date.

313
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,517
Awesome, my boy.
You've saved my image.

314
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:21,887
So, Chauka, you were
saying something to me.

315
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,793
Buddy, let's clean up quickly.

316
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,796
Let's book you a ticket.
- For what?

317
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:28,889
He's going on a date, too.
Obviously, you'll watch a movie.

318
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,330
Or are you going to be wandering
aimlessly outside the house?

319
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:31,663
I'm not going anywhere.

320
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:33,225
Clean this mess up,
and get out of here, quietly!

321
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,633
Your sister-in-Iaw will be here
at 4 pm.

322
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:38,407
I've got a date at 7 pm!
Why must I leave so early?

323
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,908
Gogo, don't kill me, now.

324
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,305
Aren't you my brother? Don't
I clear out, when you have company?

325
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,675
You would have to leave.

326
00:21:43,735 --> 00:21:45,510
You seem to forget the
lease is in my name.

327
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,215
So, that's what it's come to
now.

328
00:21:48,573 --> 00:21:49,984
You had to say that to me.

329
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:53,984
I called her over, since I thought
it's my house.

330
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,852
Alright.

331
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,917
I was mistaken.
<i>_</i> Hey' "q

332
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,156
Cut the melodrama.

333
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,964
Back off! I'm leaving,
since you called me brother.

334
00:22:04,022 --> 00:22:06,002
Go for any reason,
but, just go!

335
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,935
Then, I'll tie you a rakhi
and get a tattoo saying...

336
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,199
...that you are my brother.

337
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,450
Oh, hi.
Come in.

338
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,848
Hi.

339
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,058
Really sorry, the house
is in such a mess.

340
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:35,059
Actually, my friends stay with me,
I just stepped in, just now.

341
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,899
Oh. I see.

342
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:40,159
Will you have something? Cause,
this is going to take some time.

343
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:41,499
I can order a pizza.

344
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:43,968
I don't mind some water.

345
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,337
Sure, I'll get it.

346
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:47,701
Please, make yourself comforiable.
- Okay.

347
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,869
Water?

348
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:24,813
Can I touch it to my lips?

349
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,987
More?

350
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:38,322
No, thanks.
- Okay.

351
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,389
So, you work at a call center?

352
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,297
BPO.
- BPO.

353
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,902
Excuse me.

354
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,070
Happy anniversary, sir!

355
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,778
This is not mine. Sorry,
you've the wrong address.

356
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:01,317
Mr. Siddharth?
- Yes?

357
00:24:01,406 --> 00:24:02,476
It's for you, sir.

358
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:04,349
Happy Anniversary to
Mr. Siddharih and Ms. Supriya...

359
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,287
It's not mine, buddy!
Why don't you just wait for a bit?

360
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:10,015
Listen, it's not mine.
I didn't place any order.

361
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,423
It's a gift for you, sir.

362
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,791
Listen, I told you.

363
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,660
Take this away.
We don't want it.

364
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:17,199
It's paid, sir.
I can't take it back.

365
00:24:24,696 --> 00:24:26,471
'M' 'm' did you order it?

366
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:28,670
Yes, what's the score,
my brother?

367
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,479
Did you open the account yet?

368
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:32,037
'M' give the phone to Thakur.

369
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,817
Two, please.
- Did sister-in-law like the flowers?

370
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:37,479
Thakur, what is this 'm'?
You can't do stuff like that!

371
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:39,544
It's okay for us, why make the
poor girl feel uncomforiable?

372
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:42,022
Uncomfortable? Darn you, you
threw rne out of my own house.

373
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,615
And you want her to feel
comfortable'?

374
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,059
Get lost, you gl-IYS!

375
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,027
Get lost, it seems.
- Get lost, is it?

376
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:02,903
Supriya, I'm really sorry.
This...

377
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:07,282
...my friends Gogo and
Thakur were just kidding...

378
00:25:08,406 --> 00:25:09,817
It's okay.

379
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,456
(Didi tera devar deewana
phone ringtone)

380
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,931
Yes, brother.
Is the ring tone alright?

381
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:26,296
Yes, it's fine.

382
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,864
Listen, just come back home.

383
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,802
Okay, enjoy yourself.
That was the last of it.

384
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:34,204
Oh, my. So, you told
them that, too?

385
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,209
Well, actually...

386
00:25:36,902 --> 00:25:39,212
Are you going to give me
some wine, or...

387
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:48,384
Hi.

388
00:25:50,849 --> 00:25:51,884
Thank you.

389
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:08,639
You're quite beautiful,
actually.

390
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:13,579
I mean, I know love at first sight
is a pretty useless concept.

391
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:15,845
But, it's possible with you.

392
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,013
I'm not saying that I am,
though.

393
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:21,488
So, don't get me wrong.

394
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,683
But, it could happen with you.

395
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,687
So I am.

396
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,432
How many hours did you think
and prepare to get that line right?

397
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,236
Why don't you hit me with
the line you rejected?

398
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,670
Oh!

399
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,932
Okay, let's hear the one
which was the least bad.

400
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:46,009
You know, what was my favorite
fruit as a kid?

401
00:26:52,477 --> 00:26:53,785
And?

402
00:26:55,513 --> 00:26:57,493
You can't be here.
You have to leave.

403
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:00,620
Why?
- Outside eatables not allowed.

404
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,568
Ruchika.
The name is Ruchika.

405
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,639
Oh, my God, that
name is a flashback to the 70s.

406
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,934
It's a nice name!

407
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,577
Excuse me.
- Yes.

408
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:19,580
Can you get me a Chiku soup?

409
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,345
Sorry, sir.
I don't have that.

410
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:24,146
Chiku salad?
- Sorry, sir.

411
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,148
I am sure, you have some
Chiku halwa! - Sorry, sir.

412
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,822
If I knew you're an engineer...

413
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,916
...I promise you, you Wouldn't
have stood a chance.

414
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,122
Nobody is as boring
as an engineer.

415
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,031
Give us engineers
one chance and see.

416
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,600
No. Engineers are boring.

417
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,666
Well, at least you don't look
like an engineer.

418
00:27:50,368 --> 00:27:53,815
Why? What do engineers
look like?

419
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,609
Like uncles.

420
00:27:56,975 --> 00:27:58,386
Like your uncle?

421
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,489
No, just uncles in general.

422
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,754
Okay, how much do I owe
you for the wine?

423
00:28:03,314 --> 00:28:04,759
Oh, it's okay.

424
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:06,420
No Tarun, it's not okay.

425
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,294
How much for that?

426
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,088
And this is not boring?

427
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,396
It's a non negotiable for me.

428
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:15,903
I'll take it.

429
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:19,238
Let me salvage the image of
the engineers, first.

430
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,830
What's so interesting about you?

431
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:36,668
"The machines of my head
are in motion..."

432
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:40,238
"...now that, I have seen
her branded walk."

433
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:44,171
"All my Wicked, lazy desires...

434
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:47,478
mare excited by the glow
on her face."

435
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,186
"The machines of my head
are in motion..."

436
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,860
"...now that, I have seen
her branded walk."

437
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,690
"All my Wicked, lazy desires...

438
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,260
mare excited by the glow
on her face."

439
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:12,968
"All the girls, and so many
of them around...

440
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,342
...yet, I've given up
chasing them."

441
00:32:16,534 --> 00:32:19,981
"Let the word get out,
fill the pages of newspapers...

442
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:23,850
...with all the writeups."

443
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,821
"The Ioverboys' heads...

444
00:32:27,512 --> 00:32:30,959
...now, belong to Paro."

445
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,460
"The Ioverboys' heads...

446
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,960
...now, belong to Paro."

447
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,710
"Paro in the town."

448
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:52,012
"Her shiny stole is sheer poison,
while her eyes are brown."

449
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:56,349
"Pam's tattoo shimmers."

450
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,478
'It's a piece of diamond."

451
00:32:59,243 --> 00:33:03,419
"You look full on desi,
my love..."

452
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,791
...but, you've got an
international attitude."

453
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:10,492
"Pam's tattoo shimmers."

454
00:33:10,788 --> 00:33:12,768
'It's a piece of diamond."

455
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:17,806
"You look full on desi,
my love..."

456
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,704
...but, you've got an
international attitude."

457
00:33:21,632 --> 00:33:25,170
"Take a little break
and look into my eyes."

458
00:33:25,236 --> 00:33:28,581
"I am a fan of
your charms."

459
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:32,149
"The fever is rising higher
and...

460
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:35,890
...now, the Ioverboys are
afflicted with love!"

461
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,857
"The Ioverboys' heads...

462
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,691
"The Ioverboys' heads...

463
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,023
...now, belong to Paro."

464
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:48,696
"The Ioverboys' heads...

465
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:51,569
...now, belong to Paro."

466
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,531
Good morning.

467
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:21,135
It's certainly good for you.

468
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:26,366
What's the matter with him?
- He's going to meet his mom-in-Iaw.

469
00:34:26,597 --> 00:34:27,632
When did that happen?

470
00:34:27,698 --> 00:34:30,702
Loser, you have to leave
the room to know what happened.

471
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:34,475
Did she inform the family?
- I guess, she'll tell them today.

472
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:35,984
Or, who knows? She may
have already told them.

473
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,713
She said, she wants me to meet
her parents.

474
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,114
When are you going to
tell your family?

475
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,656
I will have to do that, soon.

476
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:43,123
Who knows? Aunt might bring
the marriage topic to the table.

477
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,790
Besides, her family is
rather old fashioned.

478
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,558
There are no issues at my
place. But still...

479
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,988
Yes, right. Why should you
have any issues?

480
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,634
It's not as if you listen
to anyone.

481
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,837
You can just send your dad
an invite.

482
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,308
So, what about your
kitty party'?

483
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,977
Tonight.
But, I'm leaving now.

484
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,439
I have to take Chiku
and Ruchi to the nail spa.

485
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,839
Are you going to
apply the nail polish?

486
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,312
The landlady is sleeping.

487
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,482
Did you make the tea, Mr. Thakur?
- He did.

488
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,915
Good morning.
- Good morning.

489
00:35:20,184 --> 00:35:21,595
And we drank it, too.

490
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:25,364
So, We're leaving.

491
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,992
Wait up. Where are you going.

492
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,196
Sit.

493
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,432
He's going for FiuchPs birthday
party.

494
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,767
And this man here is going to
meet his mom-in-Iaw.

495
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:36,641
Really?
- No, I'm just meeting her, casually.

496
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,142
Let's all meet up together,
once.

497
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:40,648
I mean, us, Chiku, Supriya.

498
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:42,349
I also want to meet them.

499
00:35:43,241 --> 00:35:44,686
Yes, of course.

500
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,448
Let's have dinner tomorrow
after the match.

501
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,484
I was saying same to Tarun.

502
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,522
Yes.

503
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,460
Let's go.

504
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,293
Bye.

505
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,326
Just see about the rent.

506
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,900
Sharma called up.

507
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:00,835
I'll pay tomorrow.

508
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,334
Don't you all split?

509
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,575
The rent? We do.
- Yes.

510
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:15,009
I mean, we don't do the math
for every little thing, but...

511
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:17,784
I just think, every little
thing may seem trivial...

512
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,015
...but, food, petrol, electricity...

513
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:21,818
...all of that just adds
up, right?

514
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,025
Don't worry about it.

515
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,434
It's open.

516
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,837
Hello, aunt.
- Hello.

517
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,677
Hey!

518
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:49,311
Come in, Siddharih!

519
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,016
Aunt.

520
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,962
What is this?
- What is what?

521
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:03,424
You should have brought
the wedding procession!

522
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,223
What do you mean?

523
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:05,926
Why are you all dolled up?

524
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,936
Supriya, you told me to come
home to meet your parents.

525
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,438
Siddharih, I said, come home.

526
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,633
If my parents are around,
you can meet them, too.

527
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,437
What do you mean?
- Siddhadh!

528
00:37:14,632 --> 00:37:16,908
You're here like any of
my other friends.

529
00:37:17,368 --> 00:37:18,745
As a friend.

530
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,340
I thought...
- Siddharih, please understand.

531
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:23,510
I can't take the risk of
them saying no.

532
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,153
I want them to get to
know you first.

533
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,689
They should star-t liking you.

534
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,587
And, then I will tell them
at the right time.

535
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,688
Yes.

536
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,589
Come along, meet my friends.

537
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,826
Hi!

538
00:37:37,021 --> 00:37:39,001
That's Siddhadh.
- Hey, hi. What's up?

539
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:43,468
I'm waiting in the car!
I won't wait on the road!

540
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:47,199
What pillow?
- Just a moment, sir.

541
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,141
Why do you need a moment?
- She'll be here. - A black car...

542
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,144
Walk towards it, then!
- She's on the phone.

543
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,838
Look at her. There she is.

544
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:52,972
Ruchi I can't see you.

545
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:55,750
Okay, I see you!

546
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,148
There she comes.

547
00:37:58,242 --> 00:37:59,482
Where did she go?

548
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,941
Gogo, tell me. Whose nails
are better?

549
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:25,703
<i>Gage?</i>

550
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,305
Cheating!

551
00:38:27,371 --> 00:38:28,873
<i>Gage?</i>

552
00:38:29,173 --> 00:38:31,915
Look at them.
- Chiku, they're nice.

553
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,614
Really?
- Yes.

554
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,121
I hate them. I specifically
told her, perivvinkle blue.

555
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:38,818
She ruined my style on purpose.

556
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:40,521
But she said, it'll get like that
when it dries up.

557
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,565
No, it won't. I'm a 110 % sure
it just won't happen.

558
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:46,826
See, Gogo? Do you think
this will match perivvinkle blue?

559
00:38:46,891 --> 00:38:48,393
Chiku, where's my phone?

560
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:50,563
I don't know.
- Oh, no.

561
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,140
Give me a call!

562
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:53,300
Check your bags.

563
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:56,140
My nails are wet, Gogo.
- Her nails are wet, Gogo!

564
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,440
No, no, no!

565
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:58,775
Tina!
- Tina!

566
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,613
Oh!

567
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,644
Gogo, you check.

568
00:39:03,774 --> 00:39:05,651
Take a look!
- Make a call!

569
00:39:05,743 --> 00:39:08,155
Yes, Chiku!
- Make the call.

570
00:39:08,245 --> 00:39:09,451
Chiku!

571
00:39:10,448 --> 00:39:12,485
What's happening?

572
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,027
It's ringing.

573
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,359
It must be on silent mode.

574
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:16,961
It's not vibrating either.

575
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,091
It's in silent mode, Gogo!

576
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,429
Let's go back.

577
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,094
Chiku, I'm going to stop
for a bit and check.

578
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,263
No, I'm sure I left it back there.
Let's go back!

579
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:25,364
Gogo, let's turn back!
- Yes, Chiku!

580
00:39:25,463 --> 00:39:28,307
Gogo, turn back!
- Yes, Chiku, I need to get to a U-turn!

581
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,535
We need to get to a U-turn.

582
00:39:34,772 --> 00:39:36,308
When is the U-turn
expected to turn up?

583
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,777
Where's everybody else?

584
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,370
Aunt, they have a shift today.
- I see.

585
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,348
Uncle, this is Siddharih.
- Hello, uncle.

586
00:40:09,874 --> 00:40:11,478
I haven't seen you before.

587
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:13,681
Uncle, I...
- Uncle, he doesn't have any time.

588
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,690
We keep asking him to meet up.

589
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,157
What do you do, son?

590
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,091
I work in TCS,
as a software engineer. - Oh.

591
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,263
He repaired sister's
hard drive from the wedding.

592
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,424
Really?
Thank you.

593
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,329
We were Worried about that.

594
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:29,671
Your printer is not working
either, right?

595
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:32,405
Can you take a look, son?
- Yes, aunt.

596
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:34,069
Right now?

597
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:36,574
Eat your food, first.
- Okay.

598
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:41,182
The rice, son?
- No, that's enough, thank you.

599
00:40:41,539 --> 00:40:42,711
Pass me the rice!

600
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,446
Supriya's dad will eat some.

601
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:54,528
Don't you think, when uncle
and aunt will find out later...

602
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:56,758
...they will be all the more
upset that you lied?

603
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,494
Siddharih! I know my parents.

604
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:03,133
It's difficult for them to
accept that I'm dating someone.

605
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,839
Specially for dad.

606
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,141
My family isn't like
your family.

607
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:11,407
If dad finds out,
I'll be doomed.

608
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:13,504
I will have to
quit working and socializing.

609
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,911
Do you trust me?

610
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,382
Absolutely.

611
00:41:46,937 --> 00:41:49,315
I'm so excited!
- Hey.

612
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:51,283
Baby.
- It's my...

613
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:55,857
What happened?

614
00:41:56,914 --> 00:41:58,951
No one loves me!

615
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,363
I love you, Tina.
I love you.

616
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,297
I also love you, right?

617
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:10,495
Tina, I love you.

618
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,371
See? Anshu also
loves you.

619
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,505
I love you, too!

620
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:20,014
I'll drive.
- Yes, Tina'll drive.

621
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,217
Baby! Baby!

622
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,717
Baby, she's drunk.

623
00:42:27,811 --> 00:42:29,051
I'm not drunk!

624
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,860
Do you think I'm drunk?
I'm not drunk.

625
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,965
I love being a queen.

626
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:43,828
Dance! It's her birthday!
- Yeah.

627
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,671
Watch it, watch out
for the side! - Awesome!

628
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,875
Baby is in trouble!
- Baby is in trouble!

629
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:51,105
Sunny!
- Sunny!

630
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:52,738
Happy Birthday, Fiuchi!

631
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:55,248
Thank you, Sunny!
- Sunny, say hi to Anshu!

632
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,319
Hi, Anshu!
- Hey!

633
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:07,027
No, no, no, no!

634
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:17,134
Oh, no!

635
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,977
Hi!
- Hello.

636
00:43:27,404 --> 00:43:29,350
You're shameless. Four overs
are done.

637
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,886
Don't blame him, Sid.
We got held up at the car garage.

638
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,350
See?

639
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,852
He retired.

640
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,027
Yeah, Gogo?
- Yeah, baby.

641
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:41,060
What happened?
- Sachin retired.

642
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,357
What about the car?
- Nothing much. Just a bit...

643
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,833
Sid, you won't believe what
happened yesterday.

644
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:50,004
Tina was so drunk, she
completely passed out.

645
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,006
And when Tina drinks drinks...

646
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,666
...then I don't think
anyone can stop her.

647
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:54,903
Right, Gogo?

648
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,103
Yes.

649
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,545
Then what?

650
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,943
Then, Tina wanted to drive.

651
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:00,380
She said, give me the keys.

652
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,677
Then, what?

653
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,115
Then, Gogo couldn't refuse.

654
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:05,619
I mean, it was FiuchPs
birthday!

655
00:44:05,676 --> 00:44:06,814
And we were all so high!

656
00:44:06,877 --> 00:44:08,117
Right, Gogo?

657
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,021
Yes, I mean, since it was
her birthday, <i>so...</i> - Yes.

658
00:44:12,116 --> 00:44:14,027
I mean, you won't believe
how fast we drove!

659
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:16,325
Really? We touched 110,
I think.

660
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,393
Or was it 120, Gogo?

661
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:21,364
It was around 70, I think.

662
00:44:21,458 --> 00:44:23,495
No, Gogo!
How would you know?

663
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,868
We were in the back seat.

664
00:44:24,962 --> 00:44:26,908
Tina told me, it was 120.

665
00:44:27,197 --> 00:44:29,507
But, Sid, despite the speed,
nothing happened.

666
00:44:29,566 --> 00:44:30,840
And you know when we banged?

667
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:32,209
When, Gogo?

668
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:33,975
While parking.

669
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,242
I mean, isn't that hilarious?

670
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,819
Nothing happened
the whole way...

671
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:39,252
...and we got hit while parking!

672
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:40,879
How silly!

673
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:42,888
Very silly.

674
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,274
Yeah! Match.

675
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,112
Chauka (Four runs)!

676
00:45:07,671 --> 00:45:08,979
Chauka!

677
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,450
Chauka!

678
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:19,692
Chauka!

679
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:25,857
Chauka!
- Yes!

680
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,207
Alright, they will win, easily.

681
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:37,209
I'll see you tonight?

682
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:39,339
Where?
- At the club.

683
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,041
Tina told you in the morning.

684
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:42,947
Aren't we all going for
dinner, today?

685
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:44,508
I told you, remember?

686
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:47,588
Yeah, right.
I forgot.

687
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:49,221
Cool. See you guys.

688
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:50,986
I'll drop you.
- No, no.

689
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:52,755
I have a driver.
Bye.

690
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,557
Bye.
- I could still drop you.

691
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,522
She'll go. Gogo.

692
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:58,992
See you.

693
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,278
You don't let me so much as
touch the keys after drinking!

694
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,441
And Tina was burning the tires at
120 since it was Ruchi's birihday!

695
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,452
While you were romancing
in the back seat!

696
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,112
He can let drunk women
drive the car.

697
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,656
But, even if I have a hangover,
I take a rickshaw.

698
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,959
He doesn't care for anyone.

699
00:46:24,014 --> 00:46:25,789
I tell you, let's pack his
stuff up...

700
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,590
...and toss him out of our
house, at this very moment.

701
00:46:27,684 --> 00:46:29,686
What's your problem, fool?
He lets you drive it.

702
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:32,561
And our house? You seem to
forget I signed the lease.

703
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,134
Loser, I am not fighting for
myself. I'm not selfish like you.

704
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,569
I am fighting for the rights of all
friends, who have friends like him.

705
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,572
But, you won't get it.
You're useless, loser!

706
00:46:39,663 --> 00:46:40,971
He's totally pathetic, man!

707
00:46:41,031 --> 00:46:43,705
If a man can be late for an India
Pakistan match, he's lost to us.

708
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:46,976
Look at me! On principle, I haven't
missed a single toss!

709
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,675
The World may turn topsy turvy.

710
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,379
Some rules in your life aren't
broken for anyone.

711
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,081
It may be your parents, your
boss, the best of friends.

712
00:46:58,749 --> 00:46:59,989
YES, 3 up riya?

713
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:02,796
Yes, S up riya.

714
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,028
Yes, S up riya.

715
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,631
Yes, S up riya.

716
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,636
Supriya and her mom
want to go to Gaffer market.

717
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,040
They want to buy a printer.

718
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:23,950
Six runs!

719
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:46,002
Yes.

720
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,536
Yes, Sidhharih chose a printer.

721
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,406
It's nice.

722
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,714
It's the perfect price.
Should I buy it?

723
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:54,473
Alright.

724
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,347
Please pack this.
- Okay, ma'am.

725
00:47:56,406 --> 00:47:57,248
Shall we leave, aunt?

726
00:47:57,307 --> 00:48:01,084
Yes, there is a dress shop
next door. Let's go there.

727
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:38,321
Who does she think she is?

728
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:40,860
Cold milk and chocos!

729
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,822
Shall we go?
- Already?

730
00:48:45,889 --> 00:48:47,562
Let's have another round
of the same.

731
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,137
I have a shift, actually.

732
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:51,834
Call center?

733
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:53,803
BPO.

734
00:48:58,302 --> 00:48:59,781
Forget about it.

735
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,845
What do you mean by that?

736
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,283
What is she trying to prove?

737
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,615
That We're all cheap?

738
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:08,849
I didn't say anything, because of
you and your equation with Tarun.

739
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,452
Otherwise, I'd buy the restaurant
and hit her in the face with it.

740
00:49:12,215 --> 00:49:13,285
Witch!

741
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:19,463
We're splitting, right?

742
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,091
It's o...

743
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,596
It's okay.

744
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,106
No, Tarun, it's not okay.

745
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,173
We'll split. It's not on you.

746
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,470
I'll take it later from you.

747
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:32,639
Here.

748
00:49:33,603 --> 00:49:34,377
It's okay.

749
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:37,008
I will tell Goga and Chauka
about each one's share.

750
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,713
Right.
- It's okay.

751
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:58,568
Why did you have to do that?
- What do you mean?

752
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:01,138
Why are you getting into it?

753
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,502
Goga, Chauka and I have
our own equation.

754
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,239
And why are you even getting
into money matters?

755
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,241
Why? Because I'm a girl...

756
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:11,684
...that's why, I'm not supposed to
get into money matters?

757
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:14,884
Tarun, I don't agree with it.

758
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:17,158
I did what I thought was right.

759
00:50:17,481 --> 00:50:19,688
Yes, you could have done
that later.

760
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,320
Why did you involve
everyone in it?

761
00:50:21,718 --> 00:50:23,561
I didn't involve everyone.

762
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:25,997
I said, I'm splitting.

763
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,429
Now, it's up to then": if they
feel guilty...

764
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,765
...that after I an": saying it,
they got their cards out'?

765
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,238
That's bound to happen,
if you insult everyone.

766
00:50:32,329 --> 00:50:33,774
Who did I insult?

767
00:50:34,664 --> 00:50:36,268
I did what I always do!

768
00:50:36,366 --> 00:50:38,039
And I won't be apologetic
about it.

769
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,010
You know, this has
always mattered to me.

770
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:42,773
It's non negotiable for me.

771
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,250
I am not forcing anyone.

772
00:50:44,341 --> 00:50:46,048
But I will not participate
in this exploitation...

773
00:50:46,109 --> 00:50:47,349
...in the name of friendship.

774
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,388
And if you have any
problem, then, fine!

775
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,225
I won't go out with
your friends.

776
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:52,692
Anyways, I barely know them.

777
00:50:53,517 --> 00:50:55,394
Kusum.
- Just decide.

778
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,329
Am I the kind of girl you want in
your life, who speaks her mind?

779
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,061
Or an": I too uncomfortable
for your world'?

780
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,130
Call me, when you are sure.

781
00:51:13,036 --> 00:51:14,913
Thakur, come in, Thakur.

782
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,347
Thaku r.

783
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:19,217
Yes.

784
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:20,811
What did the landlady say?

785
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:24,151
What did Chiku say?

786
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,160
She said, she'd buy the restaurant
and hit her in the face with it.

787
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:31,362
You whine over the cost of
a plate of snacks, fool!

788
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,569
Supriya seemed quite upset.

789
00:51:34,658 --> 00:51:36,228
That's just the way she looks.

790
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:43,034
Don't think too hard.

791
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,704
She is new to our lives.

792
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:46,873
She'll need some
time to figure it out.

793
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:50,018
Those who really care say things
that make people uncomforiable.

794
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:51,416
Otherwise, why should she care'?

795
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,412
Girls have to feel
that their boyfriends...

796
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:56,252
msuppori their ways
and methods.

797
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:03,220
Take the call, support her.

798
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:06,064
I'll do it later, fool.

799
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,000
It's not like you. We have
an understanding.

800
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,538
We understand each other
without a word being said.

801
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,133
Thanks for not picking up
my phone.

802
00:52:15,232 --> 00:52:17,508
I've understood, I will never
bother you again.

803
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:18,807
Bye.

804
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,843
Over and out.

805
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,546
Understood, what?

806
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,253
Anshu, I've realized.

807
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:27,580
Chiku, what have
you realized?

808
00:52:27,677 --> 00:52:29,554
That I am better off alone.
- What?

809
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:32,419
Anshu, no! I've decided.

810
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,524
Decided what, baby?

811
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:35,822
That I don't need you all.

812
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:38,264
I can be happy alone,
I don't need anyone.

813
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:41,830
Chiku, baby.

814
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,565
You all think, I'm dependent
on you'll.

815
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,230
I won't be able to live
without any of you.

816
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,602
That is so wrong!

817
00:52:46,696 --> 00:52:48,039
I don't need any one of you.

818
00:52:48,598 --> 00:52:50,009
At least tell me what happened?

819
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:53,344
I clearly told Ruchi, we can't
go out clubbing today.

820
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,007
But, we can go tomorrow.

821
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,043
So, how is that my fault?

822
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,613
Did you ask me before making
the dinner plan with Kusum?

823
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:06,227
But, I told you, right?
- See? You told me.

824
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,124
Why should I change my life
as per you people?

825
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,062
Why should I snuff out every
one of my wishes for all of you?

826
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,623
I wanted to go clubbing
and they went without me!

827
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,997
I didn't want to go out
for dinner.

828
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:15,502
But, I had to go for Kusum.

829
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:17,971
I went there and was told me
and my boyfriend are cheap.

830
00:53:19,396 --> 00:53:20,875
I am sorry, baby.

831
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:24,343
Of course, you can't
live your life for anyone else.

832
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:30,911
Who's it?
- Ruchi.

833
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,543
Do not pick her call!

834
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:35,481
Chiku!
- You want to take her call?

835
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,320
Fine, you go to her.

836
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,156
Don't even mention that witch!
She ruined your mood!

837
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,729
I don't even want to look at her.

838
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,025
Damn right, you won't.

839
00:53:43,086 --> 00:53:44,963
I won't speak to her
and neither will you.

840
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:46,898
You know what?
Text her.

841
00:53:47,857 --> 00:53:49,427
Text her, right now.

842
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,333
What you did today...
No.

843
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,170
After what you did to Chiku
today...

844
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,006
...don't ever expect me
to talk to you again.

845
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,307
Ever. Like, never.
Ever, ever.

846
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:00,844
Write that, Gogo!

847
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:11,688
Sent.
- Good.

848
00:54:22,726 --> 00:54:23,932
The dinner bill.

849
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,372
Please, pay it on time,
it's a non negotiable.

850
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:46,388
Yes, Supriya'?
- It's mom's birthday, today.

851
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,153
Buy a cake.

852
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,092
Pick me up after the shift.

853
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:51,393
Yes, S up riya.

854
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,934
Your mom's birthday!

855
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,806
Wish her first of all
in the morning.

856
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:09,111
Don't forget.
Save a reminder.

857
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:10,677
I thought, I'd come up now...

858
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,220
It will look odd if you come
up at this time.

859
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:20,690
Pink? Pink, pink, pink,
pink, pink!

860
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:22,730
No, Anshu!
Concentrate!

861
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,129
Salmon pink, old rose pink.

862
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:28,031
Carnation pink, hot pink.
Magenta pink.

863
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,003
Come, now We'll choose reds.

864
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:34,307
Looks nice, right?

865
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:40,811
Hey, what's the matter?
- It's too expensive.

866
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,384
Tarun, I told you, I didn't
want you to buy it.

867
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,086
Can't I get you a gift?

868
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,550
Promise me, no expensive
gifts, after this?

869
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:49,919
Yes, sure.

870
00:55:50,914 --> 00:55:52,985
So, is it done?

871
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:55,154
Yes, uncle. Almost done.
- Dad.

872
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,966
What is it?
- Nothing.

873
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:06,670
Hi!

874
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:08,098
Is the patch up done?

875
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:11,042
You tried to make sure it
didn't, but it is done!

876
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:19,514
Let's go out.

877
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,947
Your choice. It'll be my treat.

878
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,662
Don't forget to take it
from me.

879
00:56:30,086 --> 00:56:31,394
Why don't you buy a new one?

880
00:56:31,488 --> 00:56:32,933
I am saving up for an iPhone.

881
00:56:32,989 --> 00:56:35,060
I just have to use this for another
couple of months.

882
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,737
Tarun, I am not taking this.

883
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,965
Seriously.

884
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,339
Grey or silver, sir?
- Gold.

885
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,240
Thank you.

886
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,245
When will you tell them?

887
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,613
I will tell them when
the time is right.

888
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:55,012
Cheers!
- Cheers.

889
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:57,555
Yeah, baby.

890
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,992
You were just waiting to drop me
and go back to your friends, right?

891
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:01,528
Yeah, baby. No, baby!

892
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,655
It's been two hours
since you dropped me home.

893
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,466
You still haven't called me.

894
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,834
Yeah, baby.
- No, baby.

895
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:29,117
You know, sometimes I feel
one must have a credit card.

896
00:57:29,412 --> 00:57:31,323
What if you need cash suddenly?

897
00:57:31,381 --> 00:57:32,917
What if you have to buy
something, online?

898
00:57:32,982 --> 00:57:35,553
I've applied twice.
I just can't get it.

899
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,129
I can get you an add on
on my card.

900
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:39,825
No!

901
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,834
Seriously, no.

902
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:50,141
Yes, uncle.
- I hit the 1 billion lottery!

903
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,806
I got an email.
- The 1 billion lottery?

904
00:57:53,403 --> 00:57:54,848
Who sent you the email?

905
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,311
It's from Coco Cola, Germany.

906
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,751
Uncle, actually, that's
a scam. Everyone gets that.

907
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,152
What do you mean by that?

908
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,588
I got it, there must be something
to it. - Right, uncle.

909
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,489
Come home at once.
- Yes, right away, uncle.

910
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:10,827
I told my mom about us.

911
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,297
She likes you.

912
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,025
What are you trying to tell me
by saying that?

913
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:15,433
I am just telling you that
I told morn...

914
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:17,698
Do you know how guilty I feel?

915
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,098
You think, I don't want
to tell them.

916
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,665
I never said that.

917
00:58:21,898 --> 00:58:23,673
Do you trust me?

918
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,311
Isn't this dress a bit
too revealing?

919
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:27,780
Typical boyfriend!

920
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,942
Anshu, please.
I know you think I am dumb.

921
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,542
But, just because you're my
boyfriend that doesn't mean...

922
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:33,643
mthat you are going to teach
me how to dress.

923
00:58:35,945 --> 00:58:37,322
Such a rip off!

924
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,223
I told you, it's overpriced
and not value for the money.

925
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:40,953
And the food's so not worth it.

926
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:44,029
Next time, you want to burn up
some cash, give it to me.

927
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,497
I make better food at home.

928
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:55,339
Anshu, your facebook status
is still single.

929
00:58:57,634 --> 00:58:59,944
You don't want to tell people
you're with me?

930
00:59:01,638 --> 00:59:05,085
I don't even remember the last
time I logged in on Facebook.

931
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:07,588
And you're talking about
my status!

932
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:12,655
It's just Chiku's status is
committed in a relationship.

933
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:14,751
And your status is single.

934
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:17,631
Don't you think it's weird?

935
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:20,097
Yes, it is.
- Yes, it is?

936
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,099
Don't you know we are together?

937
00:59:22,158 --> 00:59:24,832
Yes, but what's the problem with
changing the status?

938
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:30,877
Tell me the password.

939
00:59:30,967 --> 00:59:32,275
Let me Iogin.

940
00:59:32,335 --> 00:59:34,178
You don't trust Chiku?

941
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:39,987
Don't ask me, again.

942
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:46,159
Dobara (Again).

943
00:59:49,118 --> 00:59:50,529
Mat Poochna (Don't ask).

944
00:59:51,287 --> 00:59:52,823
So, guys, the demo
for the Nextel is on.

945
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:54,560
They are coming over at 7:30 pm
tomorrow evening.

946
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:57,127
Check the UI thoroughly,
one last time in the morning.

947
00:59:58,061 --> 00:59:59,267
Okay?

948
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:05,008
Tarun, it will be really
great for us...

949
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,808
...if you could attend
this meeting.

950
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,280
Even after office hours.

951
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:10,844
Yeah.

952
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,652
Hello?
- Good morning.

953
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,627
Urgent?
- What?

954
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:26,295
Is it something urgent?

955
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:30,267
I mean, I just...
- I'll call you.

956
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,336
What are you doing?
- You come here.

957
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:42,146
Sit down here.

958
01:00:47,677 --> 01:00:49,020
Look at this.

959
01:00:51,114 --> 01:00:52,957
Put these on the side.

960
01:00:53,016 --> 01:00:54,324
And this aswell.

961
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,489
Uncle, we have to create
a profile, after signing up.

962
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,595
Then, do it.
- For whom?

963
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,995
For her.

964
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,769
For Supriya, who else
do you think?

965
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:11,939
Hi! When did you arrive?

966
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:13,173
Dad called him.

967
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:15,613
We wanted to check the matrimonial
website on the internet.

968
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,850
Father's name.
You know that.

969
01:01:24,313 --> 01:01:26,520
Height.
- Well...

970
01:01:26,616 --> 01:01:28,027
Five six.

971
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,659
Put that in.

972
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:32,459
And weight?

973
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:34,697
58.

974
01:01:35,558 --> 01:01:36,764
Put that in.

975
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:40,196
Complexion?
- Fair.

976
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:42,536
No, very fair.

977
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:47,105
Drink, no.
Smoke, no.

978
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:52,117
The profile is ready.
Star-t looking for boys.

979
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,961
I was going to tell you.

980
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,621
But, you thought, I am not
ready.

981
01:02:03,786 --> 01:02:05,231
Siddharih, please.

982
01:02:05,288 --> 01:02:07,290
Don't stress me out
any more, right now.

983
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:10,098
Seriously? I find out from
your parents, just by chance...

984
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:11,968
...that they are scouting for
boys for you and you are stressed!

985
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,335
I am 25!

986
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:15,272
At this age, all the parents
star-t looking.

987
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,803
And it's not like, they know
I have a boyfriend.

988
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,005
They are bound to look, right?
- What does that mean?

989
01:02:20,103 --> 01:02:22,105
They aren't going to tell themselves
that!

990
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:23,844
I know, Siddhar-th, but...

991
01:02:24,307 --> 01:02:26,685
...the point is, that it
is complicated now.

992
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:30,415
How can I tell them suddenly
after you are so close to them?

993
01:02:31,013 --> 01:02:32,219
They'll feel cheated.

994
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,455
Now, they will feel worse that
you always had bad intentions.

995
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,259
What is that supposed to mean?

996
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,958
I want to marry you!

997
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:40,432
Since when is that
a bad intention?

998
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:41,833
Siddharih, you may or may
not believe it...

999
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,336
...but I want to marry
you, too.

1000
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:46,001
Sup riya.

1001
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,673
I'll be there.

1002
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,583
I was calling you.

1003
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:00,619
Anything urgent?

1004
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:09,492
Baby, I was a bit stressed out
due to work at that time.

1005
01:03:09,585 --> 01:03:10,893
Yes.

1006
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,401
The boss is hounding me
these days.

1007
01:03:16,993 --> 01:03:20,338
Tarun, that's what a boss
is meant to do.

1008
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:23,174
At least, you should
have listened to me.

1009
01:03:23,266 --> 01:03:24,745
I'm sorry.

1010
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,247
It was something urgent.
- What was it?

1011
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:29,074
It's done, now.

1012
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,774
Okay, but what was it?

1013
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,252
What can you do about it now?
It's all done.

1014
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,118
Still, tell me.

1015
01:03:35,912 --> 01:03:37,152
Why?

1016
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:40,285
Oh, you want to know, since you
don't believe it was urgent.

1017
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,091
No! Anyways,
forget about it.

1018
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:44,358
It's done, right?
So what?

1019
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:46,691
No, Tarun.
That's not the point.

1020
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,831
You always act as if you
are the only one who works.

1021
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:53,703
Kusum, they pay me 300,000 a
month!

1022
01:03:53,796 --> 01:03:56,174
You don't...
- Okay, so say what you mean.

1023
01:03:56,265 --> 01:03:59,405
Your job is more impodant
since you earn more than me.

1024
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:02,477
What about me? I earn
just 50,000!

1025
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:05,049
So of course, I can spare time
for you.

1026
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:06,882
My work doesn't really matter.

1027
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:11,918
Baby, all I am saying is that
the higher the salary...

1028
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,722
...the more employers
expect from you.

1029
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:16,222
I am doing this for both of us.

1030
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:18,591
But, I can't help it.
I am under pressure.

1031
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:20,491
On top of that, my boss
doesn't like me.

1032
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:22,300
I'm just sick of this job.

1033
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,004
Then, why are you doing it?
Quit!

1034
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:27,337
It's not like I
haven't thought of it.

1035
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,932
But, it's not so easy.

1036
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,133
We need it.

1037
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,906
And we have to plan a lot.

1038
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:35,277
I am doing that.

1039
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,408
But, it will take some time.

1040
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,952
I've planned to star-t
something on my own.

1041
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:43,290
But, first I have to set
up the base.

1042
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,292
I have to create some security.

1043
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,590
Okay?

1044
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:51,022
Yes.

1045
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:58,367
Hi.
- Who's Neha?

1046
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,050
She was my ex-girlfriend.

1047
01:05:10,806 --> 01:05:14,049
We never discussed her,
so there was nothing to tell.

1048
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:17,458
I never thought about
deleting the mails.

1049
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:20,287
So, do you still read them?

1050
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,261
Here, let me delete them.

1051
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:30,427
All done?
Happy, now?

1052
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:33,368
Happy?
I'm not so shallow.

1053
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:38,276
So, this is why you
didn't change your status!

1054
01:05:38,334 --> 01:05:41,440
While she is single, you
can't change your own.

1055
01:05:42,171 --> 01:05:43,775
You've already changed it.

1056
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:45,648
And you logged into
my mail, too.

1057
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:47,812
You know it's not right.
Did I say anything about it?

1058
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:49,981
Logging in is such a cardinal
sin!

1059
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:52,488
We aren't even talking about
what I found after logging in!

1060
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,027
I am so sorry!

1061
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,255
Please change your password.

1062
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:57,423
Change it for Gmail, too.

1063
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:59,431
You'll have to change it for
Skype, Yahoo, everything!

1064
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:00,796
Neha, what is this...

1065
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:11,536
Did you just call me Neha?

1066
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,375
What?

1067
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:16,417
What did you just say?

1068
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:18,418
I said, the topic about
Neha is done, right?

1069
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:19,748
Don't you lie to me!

1070
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:21,811
You stored those lousy mails,
you called me Neha!

1071
01:06:21,911 --> 01:06:23,254
And then, you're lying to me.

1072
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:26,893
Baby, I just mixed up 2 sentences
in a hurry, I swear!

1073
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,286
It was just a casual
relationship with her.

1074
01:06:29,385 --> 01:06:31,296
You're so insensitive!

1075
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:32,931
No wonder she left you.

1076
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,491
Chiku, she didn't leave me.

1077
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,167
We had a...

1078
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,772
...Why are we talking about her?

1079
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,333
Do you still miss her?

1080
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,067
What do you want from me?

1081
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,439
Should I get her to talk
to you?

1082
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,173
I'm sorry, I dated someone
else before you.

1083
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:49,249
I didn't know that I was going
to date Chiku at some point.

1084
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,581
If I knew, I Wouldn't have
dated anyone else.

1085
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:54,718
How many other girlfriends
are you in touch with on Facebook?

1086
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:56,488
And, we are back!

1087
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:58,683
There is no one else, my lady!

1088
01:06:58,814 --> 01:07:00,691
Neha and I aren't in
touch, either.

1089
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:02,093
Please, trust me.

1090
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,095
Don't you talk to me
about trust.

1091
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,723
I found the mails in your account
and you called me Neha.

1092
01:07:09,091 --> 01:07:11,128
Baby, why don't you just
delete my account?

1093
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:15,641
Yes, so you can reactivate
it, in case we break up.

1094
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:17,742
How did you manage to make
this about our breakup?

1095
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,144
Since when is Facebook
so important?

1096
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:21,647
Post your picture
on my profile.

1097
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:23,375
Send yourself public
messages from my account.

1098
01:07:23,439 --> 01:07:24,747
About how much I love you!

1099
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:27,617
Why are you so hassled
about a casual relationship?

1100
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:29,555
Do you think, I'm
that desperate?

1101
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:31,888
You're going to say that about
me to your next girlfriend, right?

1102
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,220
Casual relationship?
I was just having fun?

1103
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:38,058
Baby. I love you.

1104
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:41,100
And how will I say it since
there won't be anyone after you?

1105
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,629
Because, I am not going
to let you go.

1106
01:07:45,928 --> 01:07:47,908
Do you even know
why I called you?

1107
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:50,742
It was because of Neha.

1108
01:07:50,966 --> 01:07:53,810
No! See?
That's what you think of me!

1109
01:07:54,336 --> 01:07:56,009
I called because...

1110
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:58,676
...Ruchi is going back home
for 2 weeks.

1111
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:00,577
So, the house is going to be empty.

1112
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,084
You can come and live
with me, if you wish.

1113
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,625
But, now I think I am
going to ask Tina.

1114
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:09,221
No baby, why call Tina?
I'm still around!

1115
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,923
No, Gogo. Just let it be.

1116
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:12,363
Don't do this, Chiku!

1117
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,628
I am sorry, Chiku!
I love you, baby.

1118
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:16,634
Do you know, I've prayed
so hard for this very day?

1119
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,261
I wanted Ruchi to go home!

1120
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:19,464
I made so many plans!

1121
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,405
Just like girls plan
for their honeymoon.

1122
01:08:21,464 --> 01:08:22,602
Exactly like that.

1123
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,478
You can't survive without
Chauka and Thakur.

1124
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,241
Without whom?

1125
01:08:28,304 --> 01:08:29,715
Chauka and Thakur!

1126
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:31,446
Chauka and Thakur, Who?

1127
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:33,481
Yes.

1128
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:37,051
I just hope those fools
hate me.

1129
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,491
Which fools?
The three fools?

1130
01:08:41,383 --> 01:08:43,727
The boy's family.
- Which boy's family?

1131
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,388
The people who came
home on Sunday.

1132
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,626
I told dad.

1133
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:49,225
How much I hated the way...
- The boy's family came to meet you?

1134
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:51,829
The boy's parents came over.

1135
01:08:51,894 --> 01:08:53,737
It was a general first meeting.

1136
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:55,173
Are you kidding me?

1137
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:57,403
Why did you tell me so soon?
Why not on the wedding day?

1138
01:08:57,900 --> 01:08:59,846
Well, I did tell you.
- After meeting them.

1139
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:02,682
Siddharih, I told you myself.

1140
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:04,411
I could have hid this from you.

1141
01:09:05,708 --> 01:09:08,484
Besides, you don't have to behave
as if you don't know anything.

1142
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,046
How would I know?

1143
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:12,656
Who created the profile?
- Your dad strong-armed me into it.

1144
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,126
Dad is looking at profiles.

1145
01:09:14,216 --> 01:09:15,889
So, obviously the boy's
family is going to come to meet me.

1146
01:09:15,951 --> 01:09:17,794
What is so astounding about that?

1147
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,564
So, do the horoscopes match?

1148
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:23,564
The wedding date is set
and the invites have been printed.

1149
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:24,837
It's just another boy.

1150
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,432
Don't mind it. You can officiate
as the priest.

1151
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,237
What's all this about
waiting for the perfect time?

1152
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:30,709
Is she going to release
a rocket to Mars?

1153
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,404
Is she consulting an astrologer
about when to tell her family?

1154
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:33,776
Should I call the astrologer
and have an oblation?

1155
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,075
What is up?

1156
01:09:35,137 --> 01:09:36,616
Seriously, don't they get it?

1157
01:09:36,672 --> 01:09:38,310
I mean, I'm a young boy
with a good job...

1158
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:39,943
...and I have quit boozing and
my friends to languish at your home.

1159
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:41,385
Obviously, it's for their
daughter.

1160
01:09:41,443 --> 01:09:43,821
Why else should I want to change
bulbs and mend printers?

1161
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,917
It's not as if he's Bill Gates and
I love grocery shopping for him.

1162
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:50,088
What do I get out of it'? I have
parents, they have birthdays.

1163
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:51,988
Do they, by some chance
feel, that...

1164
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:54,795
...an orphan child is looking
for his parents, through them?

1165
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,859
No, come on!
Once uncle asked me.

1166
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,132
About my dad's profession.

1167
01:09:58,227 --> 01:09:59,467
I figured, I had hit the jackpot!

1168
01:09:59,562 --> 01:10:02,270
Then, he tells me, if your
dad needs insurance let me know.

1169
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,674
I have a friend, who is an
agent.

1170
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,177
So, even if I go ahead
and say it...

1171
01:10:05,267 --> 01:10:07,770
...uncle, Supriya and I are
going to elope, he won't listen.

1172
01:10:07,836 --> 01:10:10,680
He will say, really? Pay the
power bill, as you leave.

1173
01:10:11,273 --> 01:10:13,651
Is the Tata website networking?
- What?

1174
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:15,521
The power website.

1175
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:18,091
'M', it's an expression.
It's a way of saying it.

1176
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:19,182
He's not actually
going to say that.

1177
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,852
Who's listening to you, anyway?
Both my cards were declined.

1178
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,362
How should I know?
Check the statement, 'm'!

1179
01:10:23,452 --> 01:10:25,432
Am I under contract to do
odd jobs for every family?

1180
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:28,468
I didn't pay a bill at my place.
All of you have turned into a maid!

1181
01:10:28,691 --> 01:10:30,432
All that's left is cleaning loos and
they are going to ask for that, too!

1182
01:10:30,492 --> 01:10:33,200
Sid, the maid hasn't come home.
Can you come over?

1183
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:36,469
Listen, pick up some toilet
cleaner on the way. Son, son, son.

1184
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:38,978
This says it's maxed out.

1185
01:10:40,269 --> 01:10:41,805
The second one is
maxed out too!

1186
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:50,657
You never know where the
money goes, these days.

1187
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:53,327
Have dinner out and you
spend 2000 to 2500 easily.

1188
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:57,224
In that case, I have to have dinner
thrice a day to max out my card.

1189
01:10:57,253 --> 01:10:58,459
What's the limit?

1190
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:00,466
Both together amount to
620,000.

1191
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:09,568
Hey, kiddo! Did you break
the bed, or just your back?

1192
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:11,009
Don't ask.

1193
01:11:12,001 --> 01:11:13,947
My will is shattered.

1194
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:17,410
Cry. Let it all out.

1195
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:19,342
It's a night for tears.

1196
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:22,513
I went there, thrilled to bits.

1197
01:11:22,611 --> 01:11:25,251
I thought, I'd give
Chiku a tiny surprise.

1198
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,698
Catch me!

1199
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:42,507
Anshu! What are you doing?

1200
01:11:47,269 --> 01:11:48,543
Sunny!

1201
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:52,384
I thought, you'd catch me.
- Oh!

1202
01:11:57,313 --> 01:12:00,123
Oh, my cutie pie fell down!

1203
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:01,790
Where does it huri?

1204
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,266
That witch!

1205
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,741
Who?
- Shruti!

1206
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,268
Who?

1207
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:19,339
Sunny's girlfriend, Anshu!
Ex.

1208
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,808
I just don't get it. How can
any girl leave Sunny?

1209
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:24,845
He's been crying for
two weeks straight.

1210
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,750
Since his parents were hassled
in Chandigarh, he came to Delhi.

1211
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,620
He checked into a hotel
since Tina told him of our plans.

1212
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,522
I said, are you insane?

1213
01:12:32,614 --> 01:12:34,616
Me and Anshu can
do this, anytime!

1214
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:37,093
Should we take care of him,
rather than have fun?

1215
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:39,154
I dragged him out of there
and got him to check out.

1216
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:41,825
How can I leave him alone
when he needs a friend, right?

1217
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:43,429
Right.

1218
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,103
I knew you'll understand.

1219
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:49,637
Okay, listen.

1220
01:12:49,698 --> 01:12:52,611
I don't think, your being here
will help him.

1221
01:12:52,968 --> 01:12:54,447
You saw it, right?

1222
01:12:54,503 --> 01:12:57,575
You and I will only remind
him of him and Shruti.

1223
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:07,387
I love you.
- I love you, too.

1224
01:13:09,151 --> 01:13:12,155
So, let's say Chiku is
your want and Sunny's need.

1225
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:14,291
So, technically, this is alright.

1226
01:13:15,657 --> 01:13:17,796
How can girls manage to have
boys for best friends?

1227
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:20,064
Have you ever heard of me
being a girl's best friend?

1228
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:23,008
Or, does Thakur have a female
BFF he chatters with on the phone?

1229
01:13:23,098 --> 01:13:24,805
Who are these boys,
we don't see?

1230
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,937
Where do they hide? When
do they meet? What do they do?

1231
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,572
I mean, look at a boy and
tell me...

1232
01:13:28,637 --> 01:13:30,583
...how can he become
a girl's best friend?

1233
01:13:30,806 --> 01:13:33,446
They look like us and move
amongst us, too.

1234
01:13:33,509 --> 01:13:35,284
All it takes is just
one heartbreak.

1235
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:37,017
After that, they cry like girls.

1236
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:38,785
Then, the girls feel
sorry for them.

1237
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,918
Then, sympathy,
empathy and sensitivity.

1238
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:42,985
They become girls
and cling to the girls.

1239
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:51,600
Babes! I was thinking...
- Yes?

1240
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,172
...I simply hate seeing you do
something you don't want to.

1241
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,106
Yes?
- But, I understand.

1242
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,469
So, I've got a plan.

1243
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:00,881
We're going to star-t saving,
okay?

1244
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,212
Yes? - Tomorrow, I'm opening
us a joint account.

1245
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,617
We will save 20% of each our salaries
in it, every month.

1246
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:08,278
And this we won't touch
at all. Okay?

1247
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:10,118
Yes.
- This is like our future money.

1248
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:12,920
Like our first step towards
our future, okay?

1249
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,721
Good plan, baby.

1250
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:16,990
Isn't it? I knew it. Okay,
I'll talk to you later.

1251
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:19,622
I'll do some research on which bank
offers the best interest rate.

1252
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:21,634
Good night baby, love you!

1253
01:14:27,763 --> 01:14:30,175
I know what 20% from you
would be. What about her?

1254
01:14:30,799 --> 01:14:34,246
20% of my 20%.

1255
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:48,022
A man's mind is meant to
absorb the knowledge of the world.

1256
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:51,689
But, some fools use it to
absorb a woman's nonsense.

1257
01:14:52,588 --> 01:14:56,126
If you squeeze the mind of a man
in a relationship, you will find...

1258
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:58,697
...you will find a bucketful
of nonsense.

1259
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:01,366
That amount of nonsense...

1260
01:15:01,430 --> 01:15:03,467
...is enough to make you
sick. Infect, very sick.

1261
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,701
My name is Chauka.

1262
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,207
I have been in a relationship
for the past year.

1263
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:11,579
I have lost my mind,
since I have been in a relationship.

1264
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,476
I have stopped breathing.

1265
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:16,213
I don't think,
I can live for too long.

1266
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:44,075
You know, Tarun,
we were discussing something serious.

1267
01:15:44,173 --> 01:15:46,050
But, I don't think
he heard a Word.

1268
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:48,248
He was just staring at me
all the time.

1269
01:15:48,344 --> 01:15:51,188
I was so frustrated! I was like,
at least listen to me, first.

1270
01:15:51,247 --> 01:15:53,750
Then, I'll stand up for 5 minutes
and you can get an eyeful.

1271
01:15:54,183 --> 01:15:55,753
Don't forget to take
it from me.

1272
01:15:55,852 --> 01:15:58,196
You know, they use organic veggies.
It's really good for health.

1273
01:15:58,254 --> 01:16:00,393
I think, we should star-t
that at home, too.

1274
01:16:00,490 --> 01:16:02,766
I mean, they are expensive.

1275
01:16:02,859 --> 01:16:05,931
But so much healthier and
like, more natural, right?

1276
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:09,168
Kusum, I have decided.
I am quitting my job.

1277
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:11,745
I've thought a lot about it.

1278
01:16:12,135 --> 01:16:13,580
There will never be a right time.

1279
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:15,279
This is the time.

1280
01:16:15,438 --> 01:16:17,418
The later it gets, the more I will
get caught up in all of it.

1281
01:16:17,673 --> 01:16:19,380
Then, it will be too tough
to get out of it.

1282
01:16:20,009 --> 01:16:22,615
And the market's right.
I have a good feeling about this.

1283
01:16:22,912 --> 01:16:24,789
We will have a bit of a money
crunch for the first few months.

1284
01:16:24,881 --> 01:16:26,053
Nothing too serious.

1285
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:27,560
I have planned for it.

1286
01:16:27,850 --> 01:16:30,023
But, from now on, let's
control our expenses.

1287
01:16:30,253 --> 01:16:32,392
We can cut back
on everything, you know...

1288
01:16:32,789 --> 01:16:35,065
You think, I should take
the metro to work?

1289
01:16:35,658 --> 01:16:36,864
What?

1290
01:16:37,193 --> 01:16:40,663
No, I just thought,
it's not that bad.

1291
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,368
A lot of people travel by it.

1292
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:44,735
I'm talking about
the externals.

1293
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:46,643
How much can you
save on traveling?

1294
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,082
Yeah.

1295
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:54,047
Yes. You're right!

1296
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:57,856
Tarun, I am going to make
a budget.

1297
01:16:57,914 --> 01:17:00,520
And We'll spend strictly
according to that for everything.

1298
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:03,223
Big, small, food, petrol,
everything.

1299
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,266
In fact, let's forget about
the organic stuff for now.

1300
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:06,526
Let's eat normal food.

1301
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:07,996
We have been doing
that, so far.

1302
01:17:08,057 --> 01:17:10,765
And these people? Rs. 600
for a salad!

1303
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:11,930
Waste of money.

1304
01:17:11,994 --> 01:17:14,770
I'm not talking about this.
- Be quiet, Tarun.

1305
01:17:15,865 --> 01:17:17,367
You're not alone in this.

1306
01:17:18,234 --> 01:17:20,077
I'm doing it, because I want to.

1307
01:17:21,237 --> 01:17:23,012
I'm doing it for us.

1308
01:17:25,741 --> 01:17:30,690
(Commentary)

1309
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:32,693
Hey.

1310
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,692
Now, you look like my Sunny.

1311
01:17:36,853 --> 01:17:38,196
It's a one day match, right?

1312
01:17:38,521 --> 01:17:41,195
Not live. Sachin's greatest
innings show.

1313
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:44,031
Change it.
- Do it.

1314
01:17:46,529 --> 01:17:48,975
Good evening and
welcome to Comedy Nights.

1315
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:50,533
Sir?
- Yes

1316
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:52,674
Anyways, Sachin is over rated.

1317
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:54,507
Yes, Sunny doesn't like Sachin.

1318
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:55,810
Right, Sunny?

1319
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:57,476
The fool plays only for himself.

1320
01:17:57,707 --> 01:17:59,914
What are you saying?
Look at his record.

1321
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,088
Yes, he has so many hundreds!

1322
01:18:02,311 --> 01:18:04,382
But, India never wins
when he scores a hundred.

1323
01:18:04,614 --> 01:18:06,992
Never? I mean, check
the record.

1324
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,753
I also don't like Sachin.
I like Kohli!

1325
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,832
Do you know, when he was born

1326
01:18:11,888 --> 01:18:13,094
he's mother was in this hopital,

1327
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,600
but he entered
from a different hopital.

1328
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:20,167
Sir.

1329
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:21,874
If you guys going to seat
together by yourselves

1330
01:18:21,931 --> 01:18:23,433
I'll go to the market
and get some vegetables.

1331
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,069
- Baby, sugar?
- One spoon.

1332
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:28,045
Sir, he has a pocket full of insults.

1333
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:29,515
Whenever you try to talk to him
immediately he goes,

1334
01:18:29,572 --> 01:18:31,848
here is an insult for you and for you.

1335
01:18:31,908 --> 01:18:34,650
Tell him. Tell him something about me.

1336
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:36,189
What kind of a person I am.
- Yeah sure.

1337
01:18:36,279 --> 01:18:37,451
Yeah. Friends!

1338
01:18:37,513 --> 01:18:38,685
Thank you, sweetie.

1339
01:18:39,548 --> 01:18:40,720
Here.

1340
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:47,000
The buffalo goes in the water.
- So why don't you also go in then.

1341
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,330
Everybody (flap!

1342
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:55,339
Tell me! Which color?

1343
01:18:56,365 --> 01:18:58,845
No!
- Tell me!

1344
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:01,410
Pink.

1345
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:03,716
Baby pink, or...

1346
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:05,547
Liar! It's got an orange strap.

1347
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:07,518
Be quiet, Sunny!
You're not supposed to listen!

1348
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:08,748
You should be sulking.

1349
01:19:18,654 --> 01:19:20,327
What will it take for you
sit quietly?

1350
01:19:20,389 --> 01:19:21,333
It's been an hour.

1351
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,427
She said, she'd tell him she's not
interested in marriage in 10 minutes.

1352
01:19:23,526 --> 01:19:25,403
Does it take so long
to say one little thing?

1353
01:19:25,828 --> 01:19:28,866
2 hours. You said, it would take
15 minutes.

1354
01:19:29,031 --> 01:19:31,739
My girlfriend is at a coffee shop,
while I sit 20 feet away...

1355
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:34,338
...watching her arrange her wedding
and this is what you can think of?

1356
01:19:34,403 --> 01:19:36,007
Fool, I'm sitting here with you.

1357
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:38,881
Whereas, my ovvn girlfriend is
watching a movie with Sunny.

1358
01:19:38,975 --> 01:19:40,545
I even booked the
tickets for the show!

1359
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:43,350
The rascal can go for movies
and dinner.

1360
01:19:43,446 --> 01:19:45,357
Doesn't he see other couples
out there?

1361
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,621
But, when he sees
me and Chiku, he acts as if...

1362
01:19:47,683 --> 01:19:49,185
...he'll drown in his sorrows
and die.

1363
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:52,758
And the next time we go husband
hunting for your girlfriend...

1364
01:19:52,822 --> 01:19:54,324
...let's find an AC joint.

1365
01:19:55,291 --> 01:19:57,134
Talk to Chiku, and
convince her.

1366
01:19:57,193 --> 01:20:00,174
Wow! I swear, you should be
the Love Guru on the radio.

1367
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:01,299
You're paying for this one,
fool.

1368
01:20:01,364 --> 01:20:03,867
Why? Won't you pay for the
muffin you stuffed down your face?

1369
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:06,380
Oh, sorry, you even pay
for Sunny's diapers, now.

1370
01:20:06,569 --> 01:20:08,640
Get lost!
- Why didn't you get the finger bowl?

1371
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:13,250
'M', which coffee shops hand
out finger bowls?

1372
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:14,844
This one will hand them
out from today.

1373
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:19,188
No.

1374
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,294
I think, the horoscopes match.

1375
01:20:24,353 --> 01:20:26,492
It appears, all aspects are
in harmony.

1376
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:28,296
Sister-in-law looks so happy!

1377
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:30,735
Now, she's going to leave, only
after planning their family.

1378
01:20:32,695 --> 01:20:33,799
What the 'm' is this?

1379
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:36,502
Is this any way to
reject a boy's proposal?

1380
01:20:42,638 --> 01:20:44,049
Where are they off to?

1381
01:20:50,413 --> 01:20:53,986
She texted, Pankaj will drop me home.
Don't wait for me.

1382
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:56,023
'M'! What kind of a name
is Pankaj?

1383
01:20:56,118 --> 01:20:57,529
It sounds alright to me.

1384
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:02,532
Now, he asked
where I was going.

1385
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:04,036
I told him, I'm going home.

1386
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:06,163
So, he said, come,
I'll drop you.

1387
01:21:06,262 --> 01:21:07,935
Tell me, what was I going
to say?

1388
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:10,477
No, it's fine.
I'll manage.

1389
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:12,606
He Wasn't bad, you know?

1390
01:21:13,069 --> 01:21:15,481
He has studied in the US
and settled dovvn over there.

1391
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:17,677
He's ideal husband material.

1392
01:21:18,474 --> 01:21:19,782
What do you think about him?

1393
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:25,858
Siddharth?
What's the matter?

1394
01:21:26,816 --> 01:21:28,693
Supriya...
- Siddhadh...

1395
01:21:29,118 --> 01:21:30,995
...you have to trust me.

1396
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:33,096
Honestly? Right now I don't!

1397
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,101
What is the matter?
- The matter is that I'm a 'm'!

1398
01:21:41,163 --> 01:21:42,665
I make a girl's
matrimonial profile.

1399
01:21:42,765 --> 01:21:44,506
I go to meet her future
husband with her!

1400
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,444
Just chill! She's just meeting
the boy.

1401
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:50,041
It's not as if that implies, she is
going to marry him.

1402
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:52,143
If she can leave you high
and dry, while dating you...

1403
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:54,653
...give her enough credit that she
can do it to the other guy as well.

1404
01:21:54,743 --> 01:21:56,848
'M', she can do whatever she
Wants! I don't want any more coffee!

1405
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:58,926
I don't like coffee!
Why should I drink coffee?

1406
01:21:58,981 --> 01:22:01,018
Pankaj wants to meet the girl
where he likes.

1407
01:22:01,117 --> 01:22:02,357
Why should I spend my
money to drink coffee?

1408
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:04,125
Your money, fool?

1409
01:22:04,954 --> 01:22:07,264
What kind of a name is Pankaj?

1410
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:22,044
Thakur, I'm thinking...

1411
01:22:22,138 --> 01:22:26,109
...I'm going to take Chiku on some
foreign holiday next weekend.

1412
01:22:26,175 --> 01:22:28,348
Take her, or send
her with Sunny?

1413
01:22:32,414 --> 01:22:35,156
You guys can bring Supriya
and Kusum along too.

1414
01:22:35,718 --> 01:22:37,629
It will be like a relationship
spa type of thing.

1415
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:41,532
Yes, 'm'. I'm 'm' quitting the job
and you want to go abroad!

1416
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,001
That too, with the girls
in tow!

1417
01:22:43,092 --> 01:22:46,232
My girl is loaded. And she
has her own credit card.

1418
01:22:47,596 --> 01:22:49,405
And in case you boys forgot...

1419
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:52,173
...this is our first first date
anniversary for all of us.

1420
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:55,608
Oh, my! Calendar boy, you're
rocking the kitty party, now.

1421
01:22:56,038 --> 01:22:58,018
Fool, I reminded you.

1422
01:22:58,107 --> 01:23:00,781
Or I'm going to be the one patching
you up when you take a hit.

1423
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:03,151
That's not a bad idea.

1424
01:23:03,245 --> 01:23:05,282
It'll be a two day break
from the family circus.

1425
01:23:05,748 --> 01:23:07,091
Where can we go?

1426
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:10,157
Anywhere. Let's ask the
ladies about the rest.

1427
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:11,794
Are you insane?

1428
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:13,925
They might just plan
their own holidays.

1429
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,461
They may end up going to
three separate locations.

1430
01:23:17,793 --> 01:23:20,296
I'll talk to Supriya
about a holiday, once.

1431
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:22,266
We have a good rapport

1432
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:25,177
And sisters-in-law listen to
their brothers-in-law.

1433
01:23:32,641 --> 01:23:37,647
Baby, Gogo and Chauka are planning
a holiday with Chiku and Supriya.

1434
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:41,057
I think, we are frustrated since
we don't have quality time together.

1435
01:23:42,451 --> 01:23:45,432
Okay, how's Sunny doing, now?
Still depressed?

1436
01:23:45,955 --> 01:23:47,559
You know these things
take time, right?

1437
01:23:47,623 --> 01:23:49,227
But, he's better than before.

1438
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:51,498
You know, he's coming
to the gym also!

1439
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:54,501
Really? Wow!

1440
01:23:54,597 --> 01:23:57,237
I know, you've been saying
I can't spare any time for you.

1441
01:23:57,666 --> 01:23:58,940
And I know you're right.

1442
01:23:59,001 --> 01:24:01,106
Baby, she is going to be
with Thakur!

1443
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:04,777
We have decided once we get
there, we are going to stay apart

1444
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,514
It's been so long since
we had any time together.

1445
01:24:07,610 --> 01:24:10,352
And now that Sunny is
also feeling better...

1446
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:12,983
...and it's our first first date
anniversary, too.

1447
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:16,024
And I really wanted our first
one to be extra special.

1448
01:24:16,352 --> 01:24:18,457
How could you imagine
that I would forget?

1449
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:20,932
Of course, baby. We so need
a holiday!

1450
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:23,766
Where are we going?
- Let's go to Krabi. Done.

1451
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:53,798
"Let me write a story
about myself...

1452
01:24:54,390 --> 01:25:01,672
msurreptiously
on your body."

1453
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:09,342
<i>"I'll</i> hide away your shadow."

1454
01:25:09,438 --> 01:25:14,979
"Then, the World will search
for us."

1455
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:20,192
"I've given up everything
to ask for you."

1456
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:27,759
"I've given up everything
to ask for you."

1457
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:31,836
"I don't belong to myself,
anymore."

1458
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:38,503
"My love, you're my love."

1459
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:46,352
"My love, you're my love."

1460
01:26:01,890 --> 01:26:08,899
"My love, you're my love."

1461
01:26:09,465 --> 01:26:16,405
"My love, you're my love."

1462
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:28,057
"To lose myself, in your dreams."

1463
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:34,829
"That's how much I love you."

1464
01:26:35,691 --> 01:26:43,132
"I could be pad of your story...

1465
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:50,480
...if you just say the Word."

1466
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:54,214
"I've forgotten everything,
to be with you."

1467
01:26:58,013 --> 01:27:01,517
"I've forgotten everything,
to be with you."

1468
01:27:01,850 --> 01:27:05,627
"You are my passion."

1469
01:27:05,687 --> 01:27:12,571
"My love, you're my love."

1470
01:27:13,295 --> 01:27:20,338
"My love, you're my love."

1471
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:34,819
"My love, you're my love."

1472
01:27:35,684 --> 01:27:43,296
"My love, you're my love."

1473
01:27:57,105 --> 01:27:58,607
Kusum.
- Yes?

1474
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:01,379
I have given my notice
at the office.

1475
01:28:01,643 --> 01:28:02,951
What do you mean?

1476
01:28:03,312 --> 01:28:05,519
I mean, I am going to quit my job.

1477
01:28:06,682 --> 01:28:07,888
Already?

1478
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:09,893
Yes, I told you, right?

1479
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:20,902
What is it?

1480
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,674
You made it sound like you
would quit after some months.

1481
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:26,037
I didn't make it sound
like anything.

1482
01:28:26,134 --> 01:28:27,636
Don't I get to have
any say in this?

1483
01:28:28,337 --> 01:28:29,975
Of course, you have a say
in it, Kusum!

1484
01:28:30,372 --> 01:28:32,579
Then, wait.
Don't do it.

1485
01:28:33,475 --> 01:28:35,148
I have already handed
in my notice.

1486
01:28:35,577 --> 01:28:36,885
So, I don't have a say.

1487
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:05,474
Siddhadh! What is it?

1488
01:29:05,774 --> 01:29:07,776
Are you seriously expecting
me to answer that?

1489
01:29:08,076 --> 01:29:10,886
I took you along with me,
to meet him.

1490
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:12,890
I tell you everything
that I do.

1491
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,684
I lied to my parents to
come here with you.

1492
01:29:15,784 --> 01:29:17,991
And I am sitting with you,
right now.

1493
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:20,660
But, you have ignored all of
that and all you can see is...

1494
01:29:20,722 --> 01:29:22,497
mthat, he sent me an srns.

1495
01:29:32,134 --> 01:29:33,442
Sunny, wait a moment.

1496
01:29:33,502 --> 01:29:36,005
Anshu, say hi to Sunny.

1497
01:29:36,438 --> 01:29:37,473
Hi.

1498
01:29:37,573 --> 01:29:39,644
Happy first, first date
anniversary, buddy.

1499
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:41,277
AVVW!

1500
01:29:42,311 --> 01:29:43,756
Did you eat?

1501
01:29:44,179 --> 01:29:45,522
Did you go to the gym?

1502
01:29:46,114 --> 01:29:47,354
F' rotei n shakes?

1503
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,157
Did you meet Tina?

1504
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:51,320
You knew I'm planning
my website.

1505
01:29:52,087 --> 01:29:53,794
I told you, I'm quitting
my job.

1506
01:29:54,156 --> 01:29:56,500
You could have told me
then, that I... - Where's the plan?

1507
01:29:56,692 --> 01:29:59,002
Where is the model?
Where is the research?

1508
01:29:59,094 --> 01:30:00,630
Some ground work has been done.

1509
01:30:00,696 --> 01:30:03,643
And, that's why I handed in
my notice. I will do all this now.

1510
01:30:03,699 --> 01:30:05,804
So, that isn't called a plan!

1511
01:30:06,001 --> 01:30:07,503
Are you going to plan, now?

1512
01:30:07,603 --> 01:30:09,173
And anyways, do whatever
you want to.

1513
01:30:09,271 --> 01:30:11,945
But, don't ask me, when my
opinion obviously doesn't matter.

1514
01:30:12,708 --> 01:30:14,312
Why did you tell me to save
money?

1515
01:30:14,710 --> 01:30:16,451
Why did you tell me
to make a budget?

1516
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:17,683
Why did you tell me to
monitor expenses?

1517
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:19,554
You wanted to do that!

1518
01:30:20,082 --> 01:30:21,356
Right.

1519
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,054
I am your assistant, right?

1520
01:30:29,291 --> 01:30:30,668
Please?

1521
01:30:31,293 --> 01:30:32,829
It's our first holiday.

1522
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,669
Let's not spoil it.

1523
01:30:45,741 --> 01:30:47,152
Siddharih!

1524
01:30:47,676 --> 01:30:49,849
I know we are on a holiday.

1525
01:30:50,579 --> 01:30:53,150
And it's the first time
we are staying together.

1526
01:30:54,182 --> 01:30:56,628
But, I don't want to do
some things, yet.

1527
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,497
You know?

1528
01:31:00,756 --> 01:31:02,758
No! I don't know.

1529
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:04,433
What are you saying?

1530
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:08,806
It's not as if we are marrying
after 4 years. We can wait.

1531
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:15,548
You again...
- I'm just being polite.

1532
01:31:16,271 --> 01:31:18,182
Should I star-t ignoring it'?

1533
01:31:20,442 --> 01:31:23,548
No. Carry on with the srns game.

1534
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:25,883
Siddharih!

1535
01:31:26,982 --> 01:31:29,019
This is not gossip, Sunny!

1536
01:31:30,218 --> 01:31:32,323
Oh, come on! It's Tina.
This is...

1537
01:31:32,387 --> 01:31:33,889
Mute it for a moment.

1538
01:31:34,156 --> 01:31:35,464
Hold on, one second.

1539
01:31:35,557 --> 01:31:38,003
When are we going for lunch?
We're quite late.

1540
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:40,262
Let's order in.

1541
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:43,571
This is why we came here
on a holiday.

1542
01:31:43,632 --> 01:31:45,771
So we could spend some
time together.

1543
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:48,148
If we had to have an anniversary
lunch with Sunny...

1544
01:31:48,236 --> 01:31:48,941
...we could have stayed
back there.

1545
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:50,984
Anshu! It's Sunny.

1546
01:31:51,073 --> 01:31:52,416
He's my best friend.

1547
01:31:52,474 --> 01:31:54,613
And me?
Who am I?

1548
01:31:54,776 --> 01:31:57,313
Sunny, wait one second.
- I thought, you had...

1549
01:31:57,612 --> 01:31:59,182
Why will I mute it?

1550
01:31:59,281 --> 01:32:01,192
What's wrong if he hears it?

1551
01:32:02,017 --> 01:32:03,655
Sunny, be quiet for one moment.

1552
01:32:03,752 --> 01:32:05,823
Unfreaking-believeable!

1553
01:32:10,792 --> 01:32:12,135
I told you to wait!

1554
01:32:28,143 --> 01:32:30,623
Sisters-in-law listen to
brothers-in-law.

1555
01:32:34,449 --> 01:32:37,157
Tell me, if he was talking
to you on such a holiday...

1556
01:32:37,252 --> 01:32:39,129
...would I mind?
Tell me.

1557
01:32:39,855 --> 01:32:41,425
You came here, just now, right?

1558
01:32:41,490 --> 01:32:44,437
Do you think, I would refuse to let
him go with you, if he were here?

1559
01:32:44,493 --> 01:32:46,234
He sends me 10 srns.

1560
01:32:46,294 --> 01:32:48,831
Then, I reply to one.

1561
01:32:49,965 --> 01:32:52,912
You tell me. Should
I ignore him?

1562
01:32:52,968 --> 01:32:56,472
What if dad finds out?
Won't he have doubts?

1563
01:32:56,772 --> 01:32:59,412
I am just Worried about him.

1564
01:33:00,976 --> 01:33:02,580
I will help him.

1565
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,985
There's you, there's Chauka.

1566
01:33:05,647 --> 01:33:08,059
I really think, he's taking
a hasty decision.

1567
01:33:08,350 --> 01:33:10,455
I never enjoyed
watching the match.

1568
01:33:10,519 --> 01:33:12,658
I could see that you
knew that, even then.

1569
01:33:13,121 --> 01:33:14,964
Only Anshu and Tarun
didn't know.

1570
01:33:15,357 --> 01:33:17,860
So, I sat through
India's batting innings, right?

1571
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:21,673
It is a big deal to lie
to my family and come here.

1572
01:33:21,963 --> 01:33:24,705
You are his best friend, right?
Talk to him.

1573
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:26,802
That it is such a silly
decision!

1574
01:33:26,868 --> 01:33:28,438
I'm going Whack him.

1575
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:32,283
Why are you crying?
Wait, let him get here. I'll slap him.

1576
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,249
I will talk to him.

1577
01:33:34,476 --> 01:33:36,217
He gets upset really quickly.

1578
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:39,049
Okay, wipe your tears.

1579
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:42,155
The landlady can cry, too!

1580
01:33:42,484 --> 01:33:44,657
Oh, my! Don't get so
stressed out.

1581
01:33:44,753 --> 01:33:46,630
I'm here. Don't worry.

1582
01:33:47,989 --> 01:33:50,094
She is just a bit concerned
about you.

1583
01:33:50,759 --> 01:33:52,295
She cares for you.

1584
01:33:53,929 --> 01:33:56,773
It's not her fault, you don't
have a girl for a best friend.

1585
01:33:58,767 --> 01:34:00,576
Why don't you trust
sister-in-law?

1586
01:34:16,451 --> 01:34:17,521
Yes, u ncle?

1587
01:34:17,619 --> 01:34:18,893
Come home at once.

1588
01:34:19,054 --> 01:34:20,658
Dress up well.

1589
01:34:21,556 --> 01:34:22,830
It's important.

1590
01:34:23,124 --> 01:34:24,296
Okay, uncle.

1591
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:33,510
This is Siddharih.

1592
01:34:33,568 --> 01:34:35,241
He is Supriya's friend.

1593
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:37,347
But, you could
consider him as our son.

1594
01:34:38,406 --> 01:34:40,079
Offer him something to eat.

1595
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:43,680
So, he's like an adopted
brother.

1596
01:34:44,412 --> 01:34:45,982
Well, it's implied that
he is a brother.

1597
01:34:56,124 --> 01:34:58,297
I have decided
how I will tell dad.

1598
01:35:00,095 --> 01:35:01,369
Siddharih!

1599
01:35:02,197 --> 01:35:03,608
Dad didn't say yes
to them, yet.

1600
01:35:03,665 --> 01:35:06,009
And I said, I will tell him...
- Don't tell him!

1601
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:07,705
It's not the right time, yet.

1602
01:35:07,802 --> 01:35:10,180
Siddhadh...
- Listen, just marry him.

1603
01:35:10,272 --> 01:35:12,548
Are you crazy?
- Uncle is ready to get you married.

1604
01:35:12,641 --> 01:35:14,279
But, he is not willing
to hear about me.

1605
01:35:14,342 --> 01:35:16,913
What kind of 'm' up thing is that?
- Don't talk to me in this language.

1606
01:35:17,012 --> 01:35:19,185
Listen, you decide whether
you want to tell him or not.

1607
01:35:19,281 --> 01:35:20,988
When, how and which
language will you use.

1608
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:22,892
Just call me, when you have
told him.

1609
01:35:22,984 --> 01:35:25,658
Siddharih! I didn't agree
to the wedding.

1610
01:35:26,321 --> 01:35:27,561
Siddharih!

1611
01:35:33,061 --> 01:35:34,404
Isn't she up, yet?

1612
01:35:36,865 --> 01:35:39,038
Good morning.
- Good morning.

1613
01:35:39,134 --> 01:35:40,841
You're up late, today.

1614
01:35:41,369 --> 01:35:42,507
Ah.

1615
01:35:43,905 --> 01:35:46,579
Amazing! Sunny not at home!

1616
01:35:50,278 --> 01:35:51,552
Hey, man.

1617
01:35:55,050 --> 01:35:57,326
Why was he in your bedroom?

1618
01:35:57,852 --> 01:35:59,058
What?

1619
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:00,394
Did he sleep with you?

1620
01:36:00,488 --> 01:36:02,161
Yes, so what?

1621
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:04,333
We went off to sleep
while chatting at night.

1622
01:36:14,536 --> 01:36:17,244
Sunny. Will you give us
five minutes?

1623
01:36:17,339 --> 01:36:19,410
Yes, sure.
I'll be in the bedroom.

1624
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:30,020
If a person was sleepy
while chatting...

1625
01:36:30,585 --> 01:36:33,156
...then the other person could
have slept in the other room.

1626
01:36:34,589 --> 01:36:35,465
Enough, Anshu.

1627
01:36:35,523 --> 01:36:38,367
I am not even going to dignify
this with a discussion.

1628
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,804
A boy slept with you
in your bed.

1629
01:36:44,866 --> 01:36:47,005
And you're telling me
you won't dignify that...

1630
01:36:47,068 --> 01:36:48,240
...with an answer?

1631
01:36:48,336 --> 01:36:51,010
Stop making it sound
like I slept with him!

1632
01:36:51,706 --> 01:36:53,049
He's my best friend.

1633
01:36:53,375 --> 01:36:55,582
I have had enough of this
best friend charade.

1634
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:57,380
What is wrong with you?

1635
01:36:57,612 --> 01:36:59,182
He's my childhood friend.

1636
01:36:59,247 --> 01:37:01,523
If I was interested in him,
why would I even date you?

1637
01:37:01,583 --> 01:37:03,062
Alright, so he's your best buddy
since childhood.

1638
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:04,596
But, there is a relationship,
right?

1639
01:37:04,686 --> 01:37:07,257
If he is more impodant
than me then why am I here?

1640
01:37:07,355 --> 01:37:09,699
And your childhood is past you.

1641
01:37:09,758 --> 01:37:12,204
There is a time for everything,
when things seem right.

1642
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:14,035
He may have wrestled with you
as a kid.

1643
01:37:14,095 --> 01:37:15,870
Will he do that even now?
No, right?

1644
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:18,604
What is it? Is everything
alright?

1645
01:37:19,034 --> 01:37:21,207
No, everything is not alright.

1646
01:37:21,369 --> 01:37:23,042
Anshu, don't talk to him
in this tone.

1647
01:37:23,104 --> 01:37:25,050
Leave him out of this, this is
our problem.

1648
01:37:25,106 --> 01:37:27,347
Right, this is our problem.

1649
01:37:27,542 --> 01:37:29,783
We. Do you understand
what that means?

1650
01:37:29,878 --> 01:37:31,880
What is the matter?
Just tell me.

1651
01:37:32,914 --> 01:37:34,359
He's upset, that we slept
together.

1652
01:37:34,816 --> 01:37:36,124
Oh, no, Anshu!

1653
01:37:36,551 --> 01:37:38,792
You know, there is nothing
of that son going on.

1654
01:37:39,087 --> 01:37:41,226
We are just good friends.

1655
01:37:41,523 --> 01:37:43,059
You should trust Chiku
at least that much.

1656
01:37:43,158 --> 01:37:44,398
Exactly!

1657
01:37:46,061 --> 01:37:49,065
Seriously, don't you get it?
Or you guys just playing dumb?

1658
01:37:49,564 --> 01:37:51,009
Forget about the trust!

1659
01:37:51,966 --> 01:37:54,242
There is a difference between
being trusting and a cuckold!

1660
01:37:54,502 --> 01:37:56,982
Do whatever you want and then
expect me, in the name of trust...

1661
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:58,415
...not to have
any issues with that.

1662
01:38:00,275 --> 01:38:01,879
I'm seriously done with this.

1663
01:38:15,857 --> 01:38:17,734
You can elope, if you want.

1664
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:20,069
We won't stop you.

1665
01:38:40,148 --> 01:38:41,957
You shouldn't have told
them so soon.

1666
01:38:43,017 --> 01:38:44,496
You should have taken
some more time.

1667
01:38:45,887 --> 01:38:48,026
We didn't wait for
the right time.

1668
01:38:49,324 --> 01:38:51,167
Revealing stuff too quickly
can cause problems.

1669
01:38:52,894 --> 01:38:56,398
Do you think, if we had waited
longer, they would believe us?

1670
01:38:57,265 --> 01:38:58,403
What do you want from me?

1671
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:00,639
Oh! I'm asking for too much!

1672
01:39:01,035 --> 01:39:02,412
I am so sorry!

1673
01:39:02,737 --> 01:39:04,182
I know, you told uncle...

1674
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:06,310
...and he didn't listen.
So, what can you do about it?

1675
01:39:06,374 --> 01:39:08,183
It's not all that simple.

1676
01:39:08,977 --> 01:39:10,820
You know, it doesn't seem so
when I look at you.

1677
01:39:10,879 --> 01:39:12,415
It doesn't seem like
you mind, too much.

1678
01:39:13,148 --> 01:39:15,094
The way you're giving up
so easily...

1679
01:39:15,717 --> 01:39:17,924
...it doesn't seem like it ever
mattered to you.

1680
01:39:18,019 --> 01:39:19,862
Do you think, it's easy for me?

1681
01:39:20,088 --> 01:39:21,931
Alright, then. I'll talk to uncle
again.

1682
01:39:22,023 --> 01:39:23,866
No, you're not going to do that.

1683
01:39:23,925 --> 01:39:25,063
It can't be done.

1684
01:39:26,327 --> 01:39:28,068
I know, it won't happen.

1685
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:30,932
I always knew it.

1686
01:39:32,300 --> 01:39:33,836
I don't know why I loved you.

1687
01:39:34,636 --> 01:39:36,809
I have ruined your life, too.

1688
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:40,385
I am sorry.
- You are sorry?

1689
01:39:41,242 --> 01:39:43,779
Great! What else could I want?

1690
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:47,524
Siddharih! You should understand me.

1691
01:39:47,582 --> 01:39:49,960
What should I understand?
Where should I shove that apology?

1692
01:39:50,018 --> 01:39:51,122
What should I do with that?

1693
01:39:51,186 --> 01:39:52,790
After one and a half year, you
realize you shouldn't have done it.

1694
01:39:52,854 --> 01:39:53,662
That it was a mistake!

1695
01:39:53,721 --> 01:39:55,064
What should I do
with that apology?

1696
01:39:59,861 --> 01:40:01,204
By God.

1697
01:40:01,663 --> 01:40:03,700
I've never felt so ***
up.

1698
01:40:04,632 --> 01:40:07,078
And mind you, I already felt
I was pretty 'm' up, anyway.

1699
01:40:07,468 --> 01:40:08,674
But, not like this.

1700
01:40:10,071 --> 01:40:11,379
Go away.

1701
01:40:12,807 --> 01:40:14,047
Go!

1702
01:40:47,108 --> 01:40:48,451
I know, you're avoiding me.

1703
01:40:48,509 --> 01:40:49,920
I tried not to tell you.

1704
01:40:50,211 --> 01:40:51,781
But, I am two weeks late.

1705
01:40:52,247 --> 01:40:53,988
I am really nervous Tarun.

1706
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:07,331
And now?
- This was negative too.

1707
01:41:07,595 --> 01:41:09,734
But, these tests are not
too reliable.

1708
01:41:10,565 --> 01:41:14,103
Yes, but, all five tests can't
be wrong.

1709
01:41:14,402 --> 01:41:15,710
How do you know, Tarun?

1710
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:17,181
Are you pregnant, or me?

1711
01:41:17,238 --> 01:41:19,582
I am saying, you could be
late, due to stress.

1712
01:41:19,774 --> 01:41:21,845
I read on the net,
it's quite common.

1713
01:41:23,278 --> 01:41:25,053
Were you hoping,
I'm not pregnant?

1714
01:41:26,614 --> 01:41:28,457
Weren't you hoping
for that, too?

1715
01:41:28,549 --> 01:41:31,029
Yes. Perhaps.

1716
01:41:32,220 --> 01:41:33,392
I guess.

1717
01:41:33,788 --> 01:41:35,028
But, I don't know.

1718
01:41:35,123 --> 01:41:37,660
For a moment, I thought
this is right.

1719
01:41:38,192 --> 01:41:40,866
I was nervous too, but
in a good way.

1720
01:41:41,029 --> 01:41:42,235
Didn't you feel like that?

1721
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:44,838
Kusum, what is this sudden...

1722
01:41:44,899 --> 01:41:46,572
What if the test was positive?

1723
01:41:46,701 --> 01:41:49,580
We would have discussed that
in that scenario.

1724
01:41:51,239 --> 01:41:53,742
What do you mean?
Imagine, I am pregnant.

1725
01:41:56,511 --> 01:42:00,152
In that case, I am with you
no matter what you decide.

1726
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:03,256
Tarun!

1727
01:42:07,221 --> 01:42:08,666
I don't know, Tarun.

1728
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:12,434
I just feel, I am ready
to be a mother.

1729
01:42:13,561 --> 01:42:17,202
But, a while ago, that thought
was scaring you.

1730
01:42:17,532 --> 01:42:20,035
I was scared at the thought of
being alone.

1731
01:42:20,401 --> 01:42:22,904
But, now that you are here
I felt it can be done.

1732
01:42:29,944 --> 01:42:32,083
L-lere is the partnership deed.
l-lave a look at it.

1733
01:42:33,114 --> 01:42:34,650
Chauke, did you see that?

1734
01:42:34,716 --> 01:42:36,320
The boy is doing accounts, now.

1735
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:38,955
Losers, don't fool yourselves.
I am the boss.

1736
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:40,393
Yes, you are, but...

1737
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:42,627
Then, take my signature
and do the job, like employees do.

1738
01:42:42,690 --> 01:42:44,226
You are talking nonsense.

1739
01:42:44,325 --> 01:42:45,804
Did you transfer the money?

1740
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,199
I'll get it done, by tomorrow.

1741
01:42:47,428 --> 01:42:50,068
The money can be arranged.
Just read it once.

1742
01:42:50,965 --> 01:42:53,172
Gogo, I tell you, this guy has
hatched an evil plan.

1743
01:42:53,234 --> 01:42:55,009
He's into ownership of everything
these days.

1744
01:42:55,069 --> 01:42:56,980
That's what happens
when a girl is in your life.

1745
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:04,247
I just don't get it!
What's the problem?

1746
01:43:04,912 --> 01:43:07,449
The problem? The fact that
she is a girl is the problem!

1747
01:43:07,548 --> 01:43:08,891
What else could be a problem?

1748
01:43:12,387 --> 01:43:14,731
The problem is we don't
want any problems in life.

1749
01:43:14,822 --> 01:43:16,324
But, if we don't have any
problems in life...

1750
01:43:16,391 --> 01:43:18,166
...then, that is the biggest
problem of their lives.

1751
01:43:18,226 --> 01:43:20,035
Basically, there is a time
in every girl's life...

1752
01:43:20,094 --> 01:43:21,767
...when she realizes that
now her life...

1753
01:43:21,863 --> 01:43:23,240
...is impossible without
a driver, a bodyguard...

1754
01:43:23,331 --> 01:43:24,867
...a servant or an ATM.

1755
01:43:24,932 --> 01:43:26,912
Every girl can't
afford all of those things, right?

1756
01:43:27,001 --> 01:43:28,173
So, girls look for boyfriends.

1757
01:43:28,236 --> 01:43:30,045
They try you out. If they
like your work...

1758
01:43:30,104 --> 01:43:31,242
...then, the job is permanent
and you get married.

1759
01:43:31,339 --> 01:43:33,376
The most impodant thing about
marriage is fulfilling needs.

1760
01:43:33,474 --> 01:43:35,954
And men are supposed to
fulfill a woman's every need.

1761
01:43:36,010 --> 01:43:38,547
You barely finish paperwork after
losing a job and the girl vanishes.

1762
01:43:38,646 --> 01:43:40,182
The office folks don't ask
for the ID card as quickly...

1763
01:43:40,281 --> 01:43:41,692
was they ask for a divorce!

1764
01:43:41,783 --> 01:43:44,889
Basically, if a girl has to
pay once, she vanishes.

1765
01:43:44,986 --> 01:43:46,727
Their purses contain the
legendary vanishing Watch.

1766
01:43:46,821 --> 01:43:47,891
Just wear it and vanish.

1767
01:43:47,989 --> 01:43:49,832
If you really want to pay,
then, pay!

1768
01:43:49,891 --> 01:43:51,393
Don't pretend like
you want to pay.

1769
01:43:51,492 --> 01:43:53,995
Don't pay as per the amount of
the bill, pay every single time.

1770
01:43:54,061 --> 01:43:57,668
Listen, girls just pretend to give
up in front of parents.

1771
01:43:57,732 --> 01:43:59,575
It's never going to happen
that you're earning 200,000...

1772
01:43:59,667 --> 01:44:02,170
...and she gets pressured into
marrying someone who makes 50,000.

1773
01:44:02,236 --> 01:44:03,647
She fights her parents only
so long...

1774
01:44:03,704 --> 01:44:06,344
was they can find a boy
to compare with you.

1775
01:44:06,407 --> 01:44:09,013
Then, she won't just break up
and go away from your life.

1776
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:11,488
She will discuss the why and
wherefores for ten days.

1777
01:44:11,546 --> 01:44:14,493
Suddenly, she will be Worried about
whether you've eaten.

1778
01:44:14,549 --> 01:44:16,256
If you are so concerned,
why leave him?

1779
01:44:16,350 --> 01:44:17,351
Basically, what they want is...

1780
01:44:17,418 --> 01:44:19,659
...for you to ask whether she ate,
so she can say no.

1781
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,427
Then, you will request her to
eat and she will cry.

1782
01:44:21,522 --> 01:44:24,765
It will be established, that the
breakup due to their 'm'...

1783
01:44:24,859 --> 01:44:26,429
...has her featuring
as the greatest victim, too!

1784
01:44:26,527 --> 01:44:27,767
All of them are selfish!

1785
01:44:27,862 --> 01:44:29,535
Just take the girl from
the Titanic, for example.

1786
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:32,043
Let's say one person could
fit on the wooden plank.

1787
01:44:32,099 --> 01:44:33,874
Why didn't they do 15 minute
rotations?

1788
01:44:33,968 --> 01:44:35,140
Alright, you clambered
on, first.

1789
01:44:35,203 --> 01:44:36,682
Who told to climb and go
to sleep?

1790
01:44:36,771 --> 01:44:38,216
She slept to her head's
content.

1791
01:44:38,306 --> 01:44:40,445
How did you declare
that he is dead?

1792
01:44:40,508 --> 01:44:42,112
Are you a doctor?
Did you check his pulse?

1793
01:44:42,176 --> 01:44:43,382
He could have fainted.

1794
01:44:43,478 --> 01:44:45,048
He didn't say good morning
baby, so he's dead.

1795
01:44:45,146 --> 01:44:46,352
She tossed him overboard
and went off.

1796
01:44:46,414 --> 01:44:49,054
They want to talk before sleeping,
after sleeping...

1797
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:52,825
...isn't the day enough? Can't a man
rest in peace, before sleeping?

1798
01:44:52,887 --> 01:44:54,525
And what is this talk
me to sleep bit?

1799
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:57,125
Let's say, I would even do that
to get her to sleep...

1800
01:44:57,191 --> 01:44:59,831
...but, what happens while
sleeping at night...

1801
01:44:59,894 --> 01:45:01,396
...that, they want to star-t talking
as soon as they wake up?

1802
01:45:01,496 --> 01:45:03,169
Baby, it's been an hour,
you didn't call me.

1803
01:45:03,231 --> 01:45:05,233
I need an hour, just to wake
myself up.

1804
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:07,142
Then, you go to the loo, brush
your teeth.

1805
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:08,680
You think about the day ahead.

1806
01:45:08,736 --> 01:45:10,977
Every man has a fundamental right
to think in the loo!

1807
01:45:11,038 --> 01:45:13,040
But, no! They want to talk
to you, even over there.

1808
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:16,212
Why do married men always
get late to the office?

1809
01:45:16,310 --> 01:45:18,756
Because, the ones who get up
on time, get late, due to talking.

1810
01:45:18,846 --> 01:45:20,257
And the smart guys get up late.

1811
01:45:20,348 --> 01:45:21,884
So, it's wake up, get ready
and run!

1812
01:45:21,983 --> 01:45:23,155
You just don't want
to have to talk.

1813
01:45:23,217 --> 01:45:24,924
And after putting up with
all that...

1814
01:45:25,019 --> 01:45:26,862
...their biggest 'm' is...

1815
01:45:26,921 --> 01:45:28,832
...they want to talk after
intimacy, too!

1816
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:31,734
Are you insane? Intercourse is what
it is, because it's the ultimate.

1817
01:45:31,826 --> 01:45:35,069
Why is the climax so called?
Because that's the end of the film!

1818
01:45:35,129 --> 01:45:37,109
VVho on earth eats soup
after eating dessert?

1819
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:40,077
You know, sometimes, I think they
want you to talk them to orgasm.

1820
01:45:40,568 --> 01:45:42,844
Girls only need two things
from men.

1821
01:45:42,904 --> 01:45:44,008
I love you and sorry.

1822
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:46,051
If you say I love you, they ask
you why do you love me?

1823
01:45:46,107 --> 01:45:48,280
They want to know after every
two months, why do you love me?

1824
01:45:48,376 --> 01:45:50,720
Yeah, I love you, but give me
five reasons why you love me.

1825
01:45:50,778 --> 01:45:53,190
Are you crazy?
Whoever thinks so much?

1826
01:45:53,247 --> 01:45:55,249
Didn't you ever hear that love is
a feeling?

1827
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:57,557
And the biggest 'm' of all
is sorry.

1828
01:45:57,618 --> 01:46:00,360
Because, eventually, every man
gets tired and has to say sorry.

1829
01:46:00,421 --> 01:46:02,867
But, it doesn't end after saying
sorry.

1830
01:46:02,924 --> 01:46:04,870
The real story starts after
saying sorry.

1831
01:46:04,926 --> 01:46:06,564
Do you know, why you
said sorry?

1832
01:46:06,627 --> 01:46:08,436
You don't even know
why you said sorry!

1833
01:46:08,496 --> 01:46:11,238
I am saying sorry about
what we are arguing about.

1834
01:46:11,599 --> 01:46:14,580
Try explaining to them, but no way!
They won't get it.

1835
01:46:14,635 --> 01:46:16,615
Just let their best friend
explain the same thing...

1836
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,377
...they understand it in
a trice!

1837
01:46:18,439 --> 01:46:21,443
Suraj Barjatya started this
nonsense about best friends.

1838
01:46:21,509 --> 01:46:23,785
The best friend scam is
perpetuated...

1839
01:46:23,878 --> 01:46:25,414
...with lines like, no sorry or
thanks in friendship.

1840
01:46:25,479 --> 01:46:28,221
Sir, we don't say please
to friends, we don't ask...

1841
01:46:28,282 --> 01:46:29,420
...and there is no limit
to anything!

1842
01:46:29,483 --> 01:46:31,258
When it comes to friendship
a boy can come to a girl's house...

1843
01:46:31,319 --> 01:46:33,424
...and stay as long
as he Wants.

1844
01:46:33,521 --> 01:46:36,092
A girl can sit in her friend's
lap, and it's platonic.

1845
01:46:36,190 --> 01:46:39,603
A girl can get drunk and kiss
her friend, and it's platonic.

1846
01:46:39,694 --> 01:46:42,334
A girl can change in front of her
friend, that's okay too.

1847
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:44,899
I guess, even intimacy is platonic
between friends.

1848
01:46:45,266 --> 01:46:47,212
Say one word about their
clothes...

1849
01:46:47,268 --> 01:46:49,043
...and suddenly, they
behave like feminists.

1850
01:46:49,103 --> 01:46:50,241
You can't tell me what to Wear.

1851
01:46:50,338 --> 01:46:52,545
If you can tell me what I can
wear...

1852
01:46:52,607 --> 01:46:54,018
...how does my telling
you, suddenly...

1853
01:46:54,075 --> 01:46:56,248
...bring equality, liberty,
individuality...

1854
01:46:56,344 --> 01:46:58,688
“freedom, sovereignty
into the mix?

1855
01:46:58,713 --> 01:47:02,354
And the phone is the Worst
enemy of a man.

1856
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:04,859
See, there is a stage in
every relationship...

1857
01:47:04,919 --> 01:47:06,694
...when you know, while talking
on the phone...

1858
01:47:06,721 --> 01:47:09,099
...that, this conversation will blow
up into a fight after a point.

1859
01:47:09,190 --> 01:47:10,760
But, you can't disconnect.

1860
01:47:10,858 --> 01:47:13,896
Because, girls don't think you
should have disconnect buttons.

1861
01:47:13,961 --> 01:47:15,872
They can disconnect, as it
is their right.

1862
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:18,433
Or, they want to watch
Masterchef. But, not you!

1863
01:47:18,499 --> 01:47:20,604
Because, Air-tel is <i>now...</i>

1864
01:47:20,701 --> 01:47:22,408
...here to torture you on the phone
as well as the I V!

1865
01:47:22,470 --> 01:47:24,143
Record the match and watch
it later.

1866
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:27,913
Women can be convinced that is
a genuine proposition.

1867
01:47:27,975 --> 01:47:31,616
Which self respecting man records a
match to watch it later?

1868
01:47:31,879 --> 01:47:34,587
Earlier, the service providers slashed
call rates and destroyed us.

1869
01:47:34,682 --> 01:47:36,923
When they were done,
the smart phone guys showed up.

1870
01:47:37,018 --> 01:47:39,999
Novv, tell me why do you need
to create an app...

1871
01:47:40,054 --> 01:47:42,227
...which tells someone
about your location?

1872
01:47:42,323 --> 01:47:44,064
I stop to buy a cigarette
on the road...

1873
01:47:44,158 --> 01:47:46,160
...and I get a call at once.
Baby, are you fine?

1874
01:47:46,227 --> 01:47:48,264
No, I saw you standing somewhere
since 3 and a half minutes.

1875
01:47:48,362 --> 01:47:50,342
I figured, I should call
and ask you.

1876
01:47:50,598 --> 01:47:53,545
Woman, if I call you so many
times, while driving...

1877
01:47:53,601 --> 01:47:55,171
...I am going to die,
anyways!

1878
01:47:55,369 --> 01:47:56,905
Even if a man is dying...

1879
01:47:57,004 --> 01:47:59,746
...he will probably have
to call and tell her.

1880
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,684
Baby, I'm dying! The God
of death is here for me.

1881
01:48:02,743 --> 01:48:04,882
Even then they won't bother
that the man is dying.

1882
01:48:04,945 --> 01:48:06,925
They will still ask, where
are you, how are you dying?

1883
01:48:07,014 --> 01:48:09,085
You didn't tell me you had plans to
die, today!

1884
01:48:09,183 --> 01:48:10,355
Who is dying with you?

1885
01:48:10,418 --> 01:48:12,694
Really? So, now you're
dying with him too?

1886
01:48:12,753 --> 01:48:15,097
That's how Sati got her husband
back from the God of Death.

1887
01:48:15,189 --> 01:48:16,429
She must have 'm' his happiness.

1888
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:18,197
She must have bombarded
him with questions.

1889
01:48:18,259 --> 01:48:20,865
I bet, the Lord of Death handed
the husband back with an apology.

1890
01:48:21,262 --> 01:48:24,368
For one thing, girls say
they love surprises.

1891
01:48:24,432 --> 01:48:26,912
Whereas the fact is that
women hate surprises.

1892
01:48:26,967 --> 01:48:29,573
They just love the opportunity
to pretend to be surprised.

1893
01:48:29,637 --> 01:48:32,117
They should know you
have planned a surprise.

1894
01:48:32,206 --> 01:48:34,413
They should know what
you have planned.

1895
01:48:34,508 --> 01:48:36,419
But, not through you!
Through someone else.

1896
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:38,547
Then, their real joy is concealed
within the fact that...

1897
01:48:38,612 --> 01:48:40,148
...that they may know the
surprise...

1898
01:48:40,214 --> 01:48:42,319
...but you have to go up to them
and yell surprise...

1899
01:48:42,383 --> 01:48:44,693
...and give them a chance
to say, aww!

1900
01:48:44,885 --> 01:48:47,923
Every question they ask
is coated with another question.

1901
01:48:48,022 --> 01:48:48,864
There are layers.

1902
01:48:48,923 --> 01:48:51,199
You may think she is asking you
how the chickpeas taste.

1903
01:48:51,258 --> 01:48:52,896
If you like them, that's okay.

1904
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,031
But, God forbid, you find
some flaws...

1905
01:48:55,096 --> 01:48:56,837
...then, the recipe will be
one passed down by her mom.

1906
01:48:56,897 --> 01:49:00,003
And if you don't like chickpeas
made by her mom's recipe...

1907
01:49:00,067 --> 01:49:02,013
mthat means, you hate
her entire family.

1908
01:49:02,069 --> 01:49:05,915
Why do girls feel that their
'parents are Gods incarnate?

1909
01:49:06,006 --> 01:49:09,385
You can only learn something
of value from her parents.

1910
01:49:09,443 --> 01:49:12,754
And she can mouth off about
your parents, it's totally cool.

1911
01:49:12,847 --> 01:49:15,088
You can't say a sentence
against them.

1912
01:49:15,182 --> 01:49:17,253
They will wage the 3rd and 4th
World war, at once.

1913
01:49:17,318 --> 01:49:19,696
You can call my mom
manipulative, that's no biggie.

1914
01:49:19,754 --> 01:49:21,734
If I call your mom slightly
touchy...

1915
01:49:21,789 --> 01:49:24,702
...she gets so touched, you can't
touch her for weeks on end!

1916
01:49:24,759 --> 01:49:27,069
Despite all of that,
we are with girls.

1917
01:49:27,128 --> 01:49:29,472
And those who aren't
are desperately seeing girls.

1918
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:31,804
Why? Because they bribe us.

1919
01:49:31,899 --> 01:49:34,311
Bribe is an institution
started by women.

1920
01:49:34,368 --> 01:49:37,349
Because, the bribes they can
offer, will never end.

1921
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:39,384
And we bribe takers are getting
ruined, by the minute...

1922
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,852
...won't it better to get married
to one's own hand'?

1923
01:50:28,923 --> 01:50:31,130
I am getting relieved from
the office, next week.

1924
01:50:34,161 --> 01:50:36,664
The engagement is in the
first week of March.

1925
01:50:38,933 --> 01:50:40,674
I will get married
after three months.

1926
01:50:42,837 --> 01:50:45,078
I will leave, at once
after the wedding.

1927
01:50:47,541 --> 01:50:49,384
I don't want to marry him.

1928
01:50:49,443 --> 01:50:50,717
I don't want to.

1929
01:50:51,145 --> 01:50:52,317
I don't want to.

1930
01:50:55,149 --> 01:50:56,594
I love you,Siddhar1h.

1931
01:51:00,754 --> 01:51:01,926
I love you.

1932
01:51:02,556 --> 01:51:04,558
I know, I can't have
you for life.

1933
01:51:05,492 --> 01:51:07,028
But, till I can...

1934
01:51:16,036 --> 01:51:17,481
...I want to.

1935
01:51:19,373 --> 01:51:20,545
I want to.

1936
01:51:55,376 --> 01:51:58,186
I think, I will have to withdraw the
savings from our account.

1937
01:51:58,445 --> 01:52:00,925
I can't support the
website, without that.

1938
01:52:01,582 --> 01:52:05,394
That's going to happen, if you
keep spending on Anshul and Chauka.

1939
01:52:05,452 --> 01:52:06,829
Kusum, there you go again!

1940
01:52:07,254 --> 01:52:10,758
Why discuss it, when you don't
know the understanding between us?

1941
01:52:10,858 --> 01:52:12,360
If there is such a
deep understanding...

1942
01:52:12,426 --> 01:52:14,565
...Why don't you ask them
for the money?

1943
01:52:14,929 --> 01:52:16,340
Anyway, it's your money.

1944
01:52:16,397 --> 01:52:17,569
It's your career.

1945
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:19,567
Take your half from the account.

1946
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:22,714
My half? I thought that
is our money.

1947
01:52:23,437 --> 01:52:25,280
So you want to use up
all the savings?

1948
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:27,112
Kusum, I am talking about
withdrawing the money...

1949
01:52:27,207 --> 01:52:30,677
...that I would have saved for
my website, anyways.

1950
01:52:31,111 --> 01:52:32,954
Oh! Now, I get it.

1951
01:52:33,013 --> 01:52:35,823
I thought, we were saving equal
portions of our salaries.

1952
01:52:36,016 --> 01:52:37,859
We are investing equally.

1953
01:52:37,952 --> 01:52:41,695
But I didn't realize, you are keeping
track of the contributions.

1954
01:52:41,889 --> 01:52:44,460
Kusum, I am not keeping track
of anything. I need your support

1955
01:52:44,525 --> 01:52:45,833
I am sorry, Tarun.

1956
01:52:45,893 --> 01:52:47,634
I am not able to suppod
you, financially.

1957
01:52:47,661 --> 01:52:49,572
Support isn't only financial,
Kusurn.

1958
01:52:49,997 --> 01:52:51,874
You have to support
in some way.

1959
01:52:53,067 --> 01:52:55,570
At least don't be so negative
if you can't be supportive.

1960
01:52:55,669 --> 01:52:57,171
What do you want me to say?

1961
01:52:57,237 --> 01:52:58,545
It's a great idea?

1962
01:52:58,605 --> 01:53:00,414
It is a successful business
plan?

1963
01:53:00,507 --> 01:53:02,817
You're going to become
Mark Zuckerberg with this website!

1964
01:53:04,378 --> 01:53:05,652
Foolish!

1965
01:53:20,594 --> 01:53:22,073
Sunny has gone.

1966
01:53:22,363 --> 01:53:23,535
So?

1967
01:53:25,032 --> 01:53:26,568
We need to talk.

1968
01:53:27,434 --> 01:53:28,845
Can you come home?

1969
01:53:37,244 --> 01:53:39,554
I know, you have had
problems about Sunny.

1970
01:53:40,214 --> 01:53:42,660
But, you should know, he
kept telling me...

1971
01:53:42,716 --> 01:53:43,888
...that, you are right.

1972
01:53:43,984 --> 01:53:45,622
And I should examine it from
your perspective...

1973
01:53:45,686 --> 01:53:48,030
...and then any boyfriend
can be uncomfortable.

1974
01:53:48,856 --> 01:53:51,837
I know. What we do without Sunny?

1975
01:53:54,028 --> 01:53:55,735
Stop being sarcastic.

1976
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:57,807
He's gone, now.

1977
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:01,240
I'm leaving, then.

1978
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:04,442
Stay here.

1979
01:54:08,809 --> 01:54:10,015
Please?

1980
01:54:49,149 --> 01:54:51,720
I know, you left because of me.

1981
01:54:52,319 --> 01:54:54,060
I am sorry.

1982
01:54:55,155 --> 01:54:57,567
Are you crazy?
Chill.

1983
01:54:58,525 --> 01:55:00,027
I need you to understand.

1984
01:55:00,127 --> 01:55:04,269
Even if Anshu is here,
you're still impodant to me.

1985
01:55:04,765 --> 01:55:06,073
I know.

1986
01:55:06,433 --> 01:55:08,777
You know, how important
you are to me'?

1987
01:55:09,636 --> 01:55:11,479
I am going to talk to him.

1988
01:55:11,538 --> 01:55:13,575
He'll have to understand.

1989
01:55:15,609 --> 01:55:19,079
When you were here, I felt
there is someone with me.

1990
01:55:19,746 --> 01:55:22,625
Since you've gone, I feel
so alone!

1991
01:55:22,683 --> 01:55:25,129
I know. Me too!

1992
01:55:26,353 --> 01:55:27,855
I miss you.

1993
01:55:28,188 --> 01:55:29,599
I miss you, too.

1994
01:55:30,390 --> 01:55:33,701
He's sleeping right next to me.
He may wake up.

1995
01:55:34,328 --> 01:55:37,036
Good night. Sweet dreams.

1996
01:55:37,131 --> 01:55:38,633
Sweet d reams.

1997
01:55:54,081 --> 01:55:58,029
"Oh, you fool!"

1998
01:55:58,952 --> 01:56:02,559
"For how long?"

1999
01:56:12,533 --> 01:56:16,481
"Oh, you fool!"

2000
01:56:17,137 --> 01:56:20,812
"For how long?"

2001
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:31,195
"Why didn't you accept what
you figured out, you fool?"

2002
01:56:33,587 --> 01:56:35,032
"You fool!"

2003
01:56:35,789 --> 01:56:37,996
"You fool!"

2004
01:56:40,227 --> 01:56:44,505
"Oh, you fool!"

2005
01:56:53,941 --> 01:56:59,186
"The bird pecked at your harvest and
pooped on you, for good measure."

2006
01:56:59,246 --> 01:57:03,456
"Your wretched decency has
messed up your life."

2007
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:08,128
"You are left
standing, high and dry."

2008
01:57:08,488 --> 01:57:12,834
"You are left
standing, high and dry."

2009
01:57:13,026 --> 01:57:17,406
"She used you to climb
and then walked all over you.'

2010
01:57:17,497 --> 01:57:22,310
"Run away!
You are so lucky!"

2011
01:57:22,402 --> 01:57:26,612
"Run away!
You are so lucky."

2012
01:57:26,673 --> 01:57:31,588
"Why are you lying unaware,
in the grave you have dug?"

2013
01:57:31,678 --> 01:57:35,956
"This romance of yours
is a cesspool of lies."

2014
01:57:36,016 --> 01:57:40,590
"Accept it!
Wake up!"

2015
01:57:40,654 --> 01:57:45,797
"Get a move on!
Run away!"

2016
01:57:49,429 --> 01:57:54,538
"You are truly caught."

2017
01:57:54,635 --> 01:57:57,514
"When will you wisen up?"

2018
01:58:00,140 --> 01:58:01,813
"You fool...

2019
01:58:09,483 --> 01:58:10,826
Hi.

2020
01:58:18,058 --> 01:58:19,401
Hi.

2021
01:58:23,030 --> 01:58:24,338
Who were you speaking to?

2022
01:58:24,398 --> 01:58:25,433
What?

2023
01:58:25,532 --> 01:58:28,012
I was calling and there
was call waiting.

2024
01:58:28,835 --> 01:58:30,212
Who were you talking to?

2025
01:58:30,437 --> 01:58:31,745
To Tina!

2026
01:58:32,739 --> 01:58:35,049
Let me see your phone.
- What the 'm'?

2027
01:58:37,077 --> 01:58:39,387
Don't worry, I will understand.

2028
01:58:40,514 --> 01:58:42,687
I will have to understand, right?

2029
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:46,059
You checked my phone!

2030
01:58:46,753 --> 01:58:48,289
How dare you?

2031
01:58:48,355 --> 01:58:50,892
Is that such a cardinal sin?

2032
01:58:51,491 --> 01:58:53,994
We aren't even talking about
what was in the phone!

2033
01:58:58,065 --> 01:58:59,544
Did he hug you while sleeping?

2034
01:58:59,700 --> 01:59:01,702
What? Seriously?

2035
01:59:01,802 --> 01:59:03,247
What kind of a question is that?

2036
01:59:03,337 --> 01:59:04,907
Were you snuggled up in
the same comforier?

2037
01:59:05,005 --> 01:59:06,575
How will knowing
that, help you, Anshu?

2038
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,745
I don't know, I just want to know.

2039
01:59:09,476 --> 01:59:11,888
'M' off! Seriously, 'm' off.

2040
01:59:12,579 --> 01:59:14,684
Don't forget to tell her
how much you hate me.

2041
01:59:17,117 --> 01:59:20,189
Anshu, just let it go!
Forget it.

2042
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:23,500
I would have done it,
if I could.

2043
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:57,634
I left my phone behind.

2044
02:00:16,176 --> 02:00:18,156
I told you, he's not worth it.

2045
02:00:18,211 --> 02:00:20,157
How dare he ask you this?

2046
02:00:20,213 --> 02:00:21,749
That is really cheap!

2047
02:00:21,948 --> 02:00:24,019
Why do you take so much
nonsense, Chiku?

2048
02:00:24,084 --> 02:00:26,826
You're better than this, Why do
you let him treat you like this?

2049
02:01:04,658 --> 02:01:06,569
Siddharih, I have decided.

2050
02:01:07,394 --> 02:01:08,737
I want to marry you.

2051
02:01:20,474 --> 02:01:24,149
Listen, court marriage is overnight,
only in movies.

2052
02:01:24,411 --> 02:01:25,890
In reality, there's a whole lot
of rigmarole involved.

2053
02:01:25,979 --> 02:01:27,322
You have to apply.

2054
02:01:28,081 --> 02:01:31,426
You can't go there in the morning
and get married on the spot.

2055
02:01:32,452 --> 02:01:35,126
Anyways, you better
think this over.

2056
02:01:37,157 --> 02:01:39,433
Let's see in the morning.
You handle Supriya.

2057
02:02:10,490 --> 02:02:12,993
Hello?
- Yes, Kusum?

2058
02:02:13,059 --> 02:02:14,402
Are you with Tarun?

2059
02:02:15,896 --> 02:02:17,466
No.

2060
02:02:19,199 --> 02:02:21,179
What the 'm' are you guys
teaching him?

2061
02:02:21,501 --> 02:02:23,139
Why are you both doing this?

2062
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:25,543
I know, you are tutoring him.

2063
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:27,480
He's blinded.

2064
02:02:27,541 --> 02:02:29,145
He can't see how
he is ruining his life.

2065
02:02:29,209 --> 02:02:30,552
But, can't you see it either?

2066
02:02:30,777 --> 02:02:32,484
And you call yourself friends.

2067
02:02:33,280 --> 02:02:34,588
You know...

2068
02:02:34,648 --> 02:02:36,628
...I have discussed this idea
even with my boss.

2069
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:38,219
And what he had to say?

2070
02:02:38,285 --> 02:02:40,287
That Tarun is being childish.

2071
02:02:40,487 --> 02:02:42,467
He's talking like a child,
okay?

2072
02:02:42,789 --> 02:02:44,496
He doesn't value anything that
I say.

2073
02:02:44,591 --> 02:02:48,198
But, if someone so senior said that,
obviously something is wrong.

2074
02:02:48,461 --> 02:02:49,667
I am telling you.

2075
02:02:49,763 --> 02:02:51,868
I will not be a pad
of this, seriously.

2076
02:02:52,198 --> 02:02:55,145
If he wants to ruin his
life in this way...

2077
02:02:55,235 --> 02:02:57,613
...then, I have no interest in
being a pad of such a life.

2078
02:02:57,837 --> 02:03:01,649
I am not going to ruin my life,
for his insanity.

2079
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:24,739
Supriya!

2080
02:03:26,066 --> 02:03:27,374
Supriya!

2081
02:03:28,468 --> 02:03:29,708
Supriya!

2082
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:37,850
Supriya!

2083
02:03:42,115 --> 02:03:43,423
Supriya!

2084
02:03:49,823 --> 02:03:51,029
Supriya!

2085
02:04:22,522 --> 02:04:24,399
Uncle says, Supriya
came here for a party.

2086
02:04:24,491 --> 02:04:26,164
We forced her.

2087
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,639
We spiked her drink.

2088
02:04:29,095 --> 02:04:30,802
Thakur, this is such
a load of nonsense.

2089
02:04:31,297 --> 02:04:33,140
Tell him to ask her directly.

2090
02:04:34,601 --> 02:04:37,241
The girl is agreeing
to all her dad is saying.

2091
02:04:38,938 --> 02:04:40,440
Sir, she came home at night.

2092
02:04:40,507 --> 02:04:42,612
She asked him to marry her,
in my presence.

2093
02:04:44,010 --> 02:04:46,354
Sir, we were there.
It's true.

2094
02:04:46,446 --> 02:04:49,120
Listen, buddy, you know
that and I know that.

2095
02:04:49,182 --> 02:04:52,129
The girl knows, the Inspector knows
and her dad knows.

2096
02:04:52,318 --> 02:04:54,025
She came of her own free will.

2097
02:04:55,121 --> 02:04:57,567
But, I have never seen
it in 20 years of duty.

2098
02:04:57,924 --> 02:04:59,961
No girl tells the truth here.

2099
02:05:00,026 --> 02:05:02,006
Often, they back off.

2100
02:05:02,095 --> 02:05:05,338
Do you want to move on, or
give a warning and settle it?

2101
02:05:09,803 --> 02:05:12,443
You know the truth and so do I.

2102
02:05:13,273 --> 02:05:15,275
She is agreeing with you
right now.

2103
02:05:15,842 --> 02:05:17,480
What if she backs off in the
coufl?

2104
02:05:18,778 --> 02:05:20,314
Forget about the court

2105
02:05:20,647 --> 02:05:23,821
Since it has come to this,
it is going to become public.

2106
02:05:24,651 --> 02:05:27,530
I will speak too.
The truth will emerge.

2107
02:05:28,154 --> 02:05:31,192
What will Pankaj think?
So, let's forget about it.

2108
02:05:31,725 --> 02:05:33,295
I can guarantee this...

2109
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:36,533
...you can marry her off, happily.
I won't see her again.

2110
02:05:39,866 --> 02:05:43,143
And of course,
thank you for saving me.

2111
02:05:43,937 --> 02:05:46,747
If I had married her,
I would have been 'm'.

2112
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:48,513
Siddhaflh, I...

2113
02:05:49,242 --> 02:05:50,585
You're such a liar!

2114
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:13,738
This is the account closing form.

2115
02:06:14,033 --> 02:06:15,410
I have signed it.

2116
02:06:17,604 --> 02:06:20,915
What is it?
Did Gogo talk to you?

2117
02:06:21,441 --> 02:06:23,717
No. Why?

2118
02:06:24,310 --> 02:06:26,017
Did you say anything to him?

2119
02:06:26,813 --> 02:06:28,087
No.

2120
02:06:30,950 --> 02:06:32,520
I am closing this account as well.

2121
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,565
Is it about the money?

2122
02:06:38,958 --> 02:06:42,064
Yes. It is about the money.

2123
02:06:44,664 --> 02:06:47,372
Tarun, forget what I said.

2124
02:06:48,101 --> 02:06:50,308
You can withdraw all
the money from the account.

2125
02:06:50,703 --> 02:06:52,080
I didn't know that...

2126
02:06:52,172 --> 02:06:54,584
...the money would become such
a huge deal.

2127
02:06:59,612 --> 02:07:01,319
That is what I find
really surprising.

2128
02:07:01,981 --> 02:07:03,551
You just didn't know it.

2129
02:07:06,019 --> 02:07:07,930
I would have convinced
myself, if you did know.

2130
02:07:10,390 --> 02:07:11,892
There was something missing.

2131
02:07:13,459 --> 02:07:15,405
The intentions
weren't good enough.

2132
02:07:16,596 --> 02:07:18,098
But, you didn't know.

2133
02:07:28,508 --> 02:07:31,284
And since I know how much you
hate taking favors from others...

2134
02:07:32,111 --> 02:07:33,522
...just thought, I would let
you know.

2135
02:07:34,347 --> 02:07:35,951
You owe me 850,000.

2136
02:07:36,516 --> 02:07:37,961
App roximately.

2137
02:07:52,799 --> 02:07:54,244
Sorry.

2138
02:07:55,802 --> 02:07:57,975
I know, you are angry.

2139
02:07:58,204 --> 02:08:00,309
But, just let it go, please?

2140
02:08:00,707 --> 02:08:02,687
We are good together.

2141
02:08:03,610 --> 02:08:05,180
I love you.

2142
02:08:08,982 --> 02:08:10,484
Say that again.

2143
02:08:11,217 --> 02:08:12,560
I love you.

2144
02:08:13,019 --> 02:08:14,498
I love you.

2145
02:08:14,954 --> 02:08:16,524
I love you.

2146
02:08:16,589 --> 02:08:18,034
I love you.

2147
02:08:18,291 --> 02:08:19,497
I love you.

2148
02:08:19,559 --> 02:08:20,731
I love you.

2149
02:08:20,894 --> 02:08:22,271
I love you.

2150
02:08:22,595 --> 02:08:25,007
I love you.

2151
02:08:25,665 --> 02:08:27,542
I love you.

2152
02:08:27,834 --> 02:08:30,440
I love you!

2153
02:08:31,037 --> 02:08:32,243
I love you!

2154
02:08:32,772 --> 02:08:33,978
I love you!

2155
02:08:34,040 --> 02:08:35,451
I love you!

2156
02:08:37,443 --> 02:08:38,979
I love you, Tina!

2157
02:08:40,346 --> 02:08:42,223
I love you, Anshu!

2158
02:08:43,316 --> 02:08:44,454
I love you!

2159
02:08:44,517 --> 02:08:46,326
I love you!
- I love you!

2160
02:08:46,386 --> 02:08:48,525
I love you!
- I love you!

2161
02:08:48,621 --> 02:08:50,965
I love you!
- I love you!

2162
02:08:51,024 --> 02:08:52,469
I love you!

2163
02:08:52,525 --> 02:08:53,970
I love you!

2164
02:08:57,363 --> 02:08:59,969
I love you!

2165
02:09:00,033 --> 02:09:02,570
I love you!

2166
02:09:02,669 --> 02:09:03,739
I love you!

2167
02:09:05,038 --> 02:09:06,517
I love you!

2168
02:09:07,240 --> 02:09:09,311
I love you!

2169
02:09:09,375 --> 02:09:10,581
I love you!

2170
02:09:10,677 --> 02:09:12,554
I love you!

2171
02:09:21,888 --> 02:09:23,834
I told you, he's not worth it.

2172
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:25,836
How dare he ask you this?

2173
02:09:25,892 --> 02:09:27,394
How cheap is that?

2174
02:09:27,660 --> 02:09:29,731
Why do you take so much
nonsense, Chiku?

2175
02:09:29,829 --> 02:09:32,537
You're better than this, why
do you let him treat you like this?

2176
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:34,635
He absolutely doesn't trust me.

2177
02:09:34,934 --> 02:09:36,641
It's always the same thing.

2178
02:09:36,703 --> 02:09:39,149
Like I slept with Sunny,
till the end.

2179
02:09:39,205 --> 02:09:41,811
See? I told you, Sunny
likes you.

2180
02:09:42,008 --> 02:09:44,147
He even liked you before
dating that girl.

2181
02:09:44,644 --> 02:09:46,453
He still likes you.

2182
02:09:46,512 --> 02:09:48,458
I never understood...

2183
02:09:48,514 --> 02:09:50,391
...what you saw in Anshu.

2184
02:09:51,351 --> 02:09:53,524
Yes, but...
- But, what?

2185
02:09:53,886 --> 02:09:57,231
Tell me, what does Anshu have
that Sunny doesn't?

2186
02:09:57,557 --> 02:09:59,036
Who understands you better?

2187
02:09:59,859 --> 02:10:00,997
Sunny.

2188
02:10:01,060 --> 02:10:02,869
Who have you known
for a longer time?

2189
02:10:03,696 --> 02:10:04,674
Sunny.

2190
02:10:04,731 --> 02:10:06,210
Who cares for you more?

2191
02:10:07,400 --> 02:10:08,401
Sunny.

2192
02:10:08,501 --> 02:10:10,378
Who doesn't care for
you, at all?

2193
02:10:10,603 --> 02:10:12,207
Who is rude to you?

2194
02:10:12,405 --> 02:10:14,407
Who makes you cry?
Anshu!

2195
02:10:14,640 --> 02:10:16,677
I don't know why I am with him.

2196
02:10:17,110 --> 02:10:19,647
I just don't know.
I don't know anything.

2197
02:10:21,948 --> 02:10:24,189
Do you think, I should break
up with him?

2198
02:10:28,721 --> 02:10:30,200
It's your call.

2199
02:10:30,390 --> 02:10:32,495
But, I feel bad to see you...

2200
02:10:51,110 --> 02:10:52,350
I love you.

2201
02:10:56,115 --> 02:10:58,857
These three words
are so cheap and fake.

2202
02:11:01,320 --> 02:11:03,800
Anyone can write them
up, at any place.

2203
02:11:06,025 --> 02:11:07,732
Anyone can say them to anyone.

2204
02:11:11,330 --> 02:11:12,866
You can forget them
at any time...

2205
02:11:20,873 --> 02:11:22,181
I love you.

2206
02:11:42,595 --> 02:11:45,474
Yes, morn? Hello.

2207
02:11:45,865 --> 02:11:47,970
How are you?
- Listen, I am telling you.

2208
02:11:48,034 --> 02:11:49,377
A mother's love...
- I'm with Gogo and Thakur.

2209
02:11:49,469 --> 02:11:51,107
...Is the greatest love of all.
- Alright.

2210
02:11:52,205 --> 02:11:54,151
How do these moms do it?
- Are you well?

2211
02:11:54,474 --> 02:11:56,147
Meerut?
- Without asking for anything.

2212
02:11:56,209 --> 02:11:58,155
Without wanting anything.
- How did that happen?

2213
02:11:59,278 --> 02:12:01,485
Unconditional.
- Meerut is a nice place.

2214
02:12:02,548 --> 02:12:04,357
I am going now.
I've had too much to drink.

2215
02:12:05,351 --> 02:12:07,194
Hello, Mom?
- Meerut?

2216
02:12:08,287 --> 02:12:10,460
Nothing, just missing you.
- Oh, there.

2217
02:12:11,324 --> 02:12:13,326
I love you.
- Yes.

2218
02:12:13,826 --> 02:12:15,362
I am not drunk.
- I am not going anywhere.

2219
02:12:15,461 --> 02:12:16,906
Okay.
- Just wanted to say it.

2220
02:12:16,996 --> 02:12:19,203
I didn't break up! No way.
- It's nothing.

2221
02:12:19,298 --> 02:12:20,834
All well.
- I just wanted to say it.

2222
02:12:20,900 --> 02:12:22,504
I don't need money.

2223
02:12:22,568 --> 02:12:23,842
And, so tell me more.

2224
02:12:24,103 --> 02:12:25,810
No, I am not drinking.
- Okay.

2225
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:29,579
I won't eat. Don't worry.
- I am just about to drink.

2226
02:12:29,675 --> 02:12:31,814
Stop scolding me.
- Yes.

2227
02:12:31,878 --> 02:12:34,449
What was he saying?
- I just love you, mom.

2228
02:12:35,748 --> 02:12:36,818
He won't be coming, right?
- I miss you.

2229
02:12:36,916 --> 02:12:38,088
Nothing.

2230
02:12:38,151 --> 02:12:40,028
He said, it would be after two months.
- Just like that.

2231
02:12:40,119 --> 02:12:41,223
No, I'm coming.

2232
02:12:41,320 --> 02:12:43,425
No, there's no hassle.
- I will be coming next week.

2233
02:12:45,825 --> 02:12:47,805
Yes, baby! Sorry, yeah Gogo.

2234
02:12:48,060 --> 02:12:51,439
Don't blame him, Sid.
The car was late...

2235
02:12:51,497 --> 02:12:53,704
We checked into the
hotel, because...

2236
02:12:55,101 --> 02:12:57,308
Sorry. I forgot the next line.

2237
02:12:57,370 --> 02:12:58,314
What is the dialogue?

2238
02:12:58,371 --> 02:13:00,647
Basically, if the girl has
to pay...

2239
02:13:00,706 --> 02:13:02,515
...the purse vanishes.
It goes away.

2240
02:13:02,575 --> 02:13:05,556
Where is he going?
On whose shoulder is he crying?

2241
02:13:05,645 --> 02:13:08,524
If you lean against their shoulder
you will be be...

2242
02:13:09,348 --> 02:13:10,986
Even after the marriage...

2243
02:13:11,050 --> 02:13:12,393
But...

2244
02:13:12,718 --> 02:13:13,890
Action.

2245
02:13:15,221 --> 02:13:17,462
One moment, something
went into my eye.

2246
02:13:18,925 --> 02:13:20,404
There's no water.
- No one said tring.

2247
02:13:20,493 --> 02:13:21,801
Sorry.
- Cut.

2248
02:13:21,861 --> 02:13:23,704
I mean, she...
Oh, no.

2249
02:13:23,896 --> 02:13:25,967
A man who can't be there
for India Pakistan...

2250
02:13:26,032 --> 02:13:27,204
Oh, no!

2251
02:13:27,433 --> 02:13:28,844
Sir, I don't know
what is going on.

2252
02:13:28,901 --> 02:13:30,244
Ask S up riya.

2253
02:13:31,504 --> 02:13:33,506
Cut. Action.
- Sorry again.

2254
02:13:33,606 --> 02:13:35,142
I won't do it again.
- I am saying no.

2255
02:13:35,241 --> 02:13:36,481
You can't...

2256
02:13:36,542 --> 02:13:38,613
Is it a successful
business plan?

2257
02:13:39,378 --> 02:13:41,255
It's a great success...

2258
02:13:47,153 --> 02:13:48,496
Sir, he laughs!

2259
02:13:49,956 --> 02:13:51,663
No, I'm just saying...

2260
02:13:54,060 --> 02:13:56,131
Sports doesn't help
financially, Kusurn.

2261
02:13:56,195 --> 02:13:57,640
Kusum...
- Cut.

2262
