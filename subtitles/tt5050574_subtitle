00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,100
RESURRECTION ERTUGRUL

2
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,160
THE STORIES AND CHARACTERS DEPICTED
HERE WERE INSPIRED BY OUR HISTORY

3
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:09,600
NO ANIMALS WERE HARMED DURING
THE FILMING OF THIS PRODUCTION

4
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,400
Continue until he speaks.

5
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,330
You will not even taste the joy
of rotting in the dungeons of Aleppo.

6
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,500
Bamsi? Dogan?

7
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,230
Bamsi?

8
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,360
Dogan?

9
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,830
Ertugrul Bey?

10
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,460
Aykiz? My Aykiz.

11
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,200
My Aykiz.

12
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,900
Aykiz. Aykiz.

13
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,930
Ustad, I congratulate you.

14
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,960
My vizier?

15
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,600
Thank God!

16
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,300
I’m grateful to God to see you alive.

17
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,260
My vizier...

18
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,230
...what am I doing here?
What do these men want from me?

19
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,230
Are they...

20
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,000
Are you...

21
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,860
...suspecting me?

22
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,930
Do you think that I betrayed you?

23
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,260
Now...

24
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,000
...my eyes are open wide enough
to see the truth.

25
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:57,900
If you even have
a doubt they I am a traitor...

26
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,930
...if you have the slightest doubt...

27
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,560
...kill me here at once without hesitation.

28
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,030
I don’t care about your life...

29
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,000
...or your death...

30
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,060
...as much as I care about
a knot in this Turkmen carpet.

31
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,260
Now, I am listening to you. Speak!

32
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,300
Hasn’t this Turkmen goat herder
spoken yet?

33
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:58,160
Don’t let him die.

34
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,300
Let me have some fun
while you are having your lunch.

35
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,930
Do not die, alright?
Our fun is not finished yet.

36
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,530
It is my turn to have fun.

37
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,100
Just like the tick in the carpet found its
home, you found your home in this barrel...

38
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,100
...you Turkmen goat herder.

39
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,500
Tell me, Esma. Who else is a Templar
other than you in the palace?

40
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:51,130
What is the goal of
the Templars within the Aleppo palace?

41
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,130
I wish I would die...

42
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:02,530
I wish you killed me, so I wouldn’t
have to bear the pain of your doubts.

43
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,330
Stop lying to me!

44
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,360
Tell me the truth.

45
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,330
Esma, why did you do this to me?

46
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,860
My vizier, I did not betray you.

47
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,330
I didn’t lie in the court,
when I testified against you either...

48
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,430
...I only told what I saw.

49
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,860
I beg you...

50
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,330
I beg you,
please don’t treat me like a traitor.

51
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,130
What did I do to deserve this?

52
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,300
Who are the other Templars in Aleppo?

53
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,030
How is your trade, Abu Hisam?

54
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:20,030
Abu Hisam. I yearn for the day I’ll get
rid of this name and these Muslim attires.

55
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,600
But the answer to your question
is positive, Nasir.

56
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,900
Good.

57
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:39,100
Anything that can be converted into money.
Mines, quarries, big fields...

58
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,800
...we will own them all.

59
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,100
Bit by bit.

60
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,400
While El Aziz dreams about
swimming in pools of gold...

61
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,460
...all the treasure of Aleppo will flow
into the cool cellars of our castle.

62
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,600
Until his highness the Ameer turns into
a beggar who begs from the Templars...

63
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,360
...we shall take everything he has.

64
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:08,530
Then, I shall give you the good news.

65
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:13,130
Ertugrul is in our hands.

66
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
You will give him to me.

67
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,930
You have to learn to be patient,
my precious friend.

68
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,130
After we use that goat herder as a bait
to pull Sahabeddin into our trap...

69
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,960
...then Ertugrul will be yours.

70
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,930
Do we have permission, sisters?

71
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:51,530
Of course, please.

72
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,300
My children...

73
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,860
...how much you hurt inside
can be seen from the tears in your eyes.

74
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:22,160
Not knowing the fate of those whom you
wait is eating your heart out like a worm.

75
00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:29,500
Your pain is great.
But big dreams require big sacrifices.

76
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:37,930
Who sees the dream, my Effendi?
Will Ertugrul and Turgut be sacrificed?

77
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:45,860
Once upon a time, Prophet Abraham
wanted to have a son.

78
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,160
He prayed to God over and over again.

79
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:56,930
He said if he had a son,
he would sacrifice him to God.

80
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,930
One day, Prophet Abraham was touched
by a piece of eternal mercy of God...

81
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,430
...and Ishmael opened his eyes to this world.

82
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,160
Then, one day Abraham saw a dream.

83
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,530
In his dream he saw that
he was sacrificing Ishmael.

84
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,860
He told this dream to Ishmael.

85
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,160
A son is like an essence of the father.
Ishmael was a believer like his father.

86
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,800
He accepted.

87
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:37,600
He said, “do not grieve, father.
Carry out your promise to our Great God.”

88
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,560
As his heart rose with compassion,
as his soul got ripped apart with pain...

89
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:51,300
...he put the knife to Ishmael’s neck
at a dark corner.

90
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,460
Just at that moment, Gabriel came down
with a sacrificial ram on his lap.

91
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:04,260
God witnesses that you are one of those
who keep their promises.

92
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,800
Take that knife from Ishmael’s neck
and sacrifice this.

93
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,100
Thank God.

94
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,060
It is like this, my children.

95
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:25,600
Those who dream big and keep their promise
need to be ready for big sacrifices.

96
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,330
Ertugrul and his companions
are passionate to see a good dream...

97
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,030
...for the Muslim world
who are living in a nightmare right now.

98
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,260
That is why they put their necks
to the knife like Ishmael.

99
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,230
Knife will not be hurt from them.

100
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,360
With His help, the Compassionate
and the Merciful God...

101
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,300
...won’t let those brave men to be hurt.

102
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,600
You scared us, Halime.

103
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,560
I am so sorry, governess.
I made you worry.

104
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,260
When an ache struck like that
all of a sudden...

105
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,300
Are you better now?

106
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,930
I am better, thank you.

107
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,060
Your father is here, outside.

108
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,130
Stop. Don’t try to get up.

109
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,000
Governess, let us invite him in.

110
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:01,000
And I shall take some fresh air.

111
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,360
Come in, Numan Effendi.

112
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,100
My girl.

113
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,530
Thank God I am well, father.

114
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,860
-Father.
-Tell me, my girl.

115
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,030
I am aware of what happened.

116
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,160
I know what happened to Ertugrul, father.

117
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,060
First Yigit, now Ertugrul.

118
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,560
How will we get rid of this trouble we are in, father?

119
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
My girl...

120
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:02,430
His highness Ameer would like to
see Numan Effendi.

121
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,530
My girl.

122
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:32,560
Your highness, when the whole Muslim world
was in the dark...

123
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:38,460
...you rose up like the sun above Aleppo.
I am thankful to God for this.

124
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,830
You are the hope not only for this this city
but all the sufferers.

125
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:48,360
Don’t say that.

126
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,060
Yes, your highness.

127
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,390
Welcome.

128
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,860
Come in, come close, please.

129
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,830
You know how valuable
these prisoners are for us.

130
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,100
Titus!

131
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,260
Everything in this world will be over,
everything will be forgotten...

132
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:29,430
...everything will be forgiven...

133
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,060
...but I will not forgive you!

134
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,560
I will never forget
what you have done to us!

135
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,200
You lowlife dog!

136
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,300
I wanted to introduce you to two of
the most precious persons of Aleppo.

137
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,960
-Peace be upon you.
-And peace be upon you.

138
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,330
And peace be upon you, Kurdoglu.

139
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:25,430
Since I have seen you so well father...

140
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,460
...nothing bothers me anymore.

141
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,000
Thank you, God.

142
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,400
And you gave me the good news of
a grandchild, son.

143
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:35,160
You made me happy.

144
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,400
We are in a bind once again,
Suleyman Shah.

145
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,600
-Rahman told us.
-I understand.

146
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,130
What will we do, my Bey?
What is on your mind?

147
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,360
We are passing the straight path, Kurdoglu.

148
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,420
We will clear this matter without
harming or being harmed...

149
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,000
...and without falling into hell.

150
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,460
Why did they imprison my brother?

151
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,900
It is a game of these Crusader infidels.

152
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,100
Templars have infiltrated everywhere.

153
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,400
Then we should go and
bring down the sky on top of them.

154
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,860
So many Alps have become martyrs
because of these infidels.

155
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,560
Our tribe got scattered.
We almost went to war with Kara Toygar.

156
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,030
We won’t find peace until
we finish them all.

157
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,960
But Gundogdu, the tribe is on migration.
We are not ready for a war.

158
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,900
I told you that Aleppo would be our grave.

159
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,130
Do not worry, Kurdoglu.
Someone from our blood will come and...

160
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,560
...won’t leave our graves here.

161
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,500
Now, listen to me closely.

162
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:52,460
Another valuable friend of mine
whom I want you to meet it...

163
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,530
Open the door!

164
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,030
Your highness Ameer.

165
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,600
What kind of an imprudence is this?
What do you think you are doing?

166
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,230
Nasir, I am hoping that you will give a
suitable punishment to this tactless man.

167
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,680
-Of course.

168
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,320
His highness Ameer...

169
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,680
...regarding Commander Nasir’s order
to collect information on a case...

170
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,560
...we have attained vital news.

171
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:26,560
That is why I had to barge in.
I beg for your forgiveness.

172
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,300
Commander, as per your order, we looked
everywhere and we are now sure that...

173
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,530
...servant Esma has been kidnapped
from the palace.

174
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,600
Excuse me!

175
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,960
Nasir?

176
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,400
Go and search...

177
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:01,600
...every house in Aleppo one by one
if necessary and find Esma, Nasir.

178
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,030
I mean, right now.

179
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,500
Tomorrow, we will be leaving for Aleppo.
Either we will get our homeland from there...

180
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:21,200
...or we will die! There is no other way.

181
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,060
What about Ertugrul?

182
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,530
We do not know what he is accused of.

183
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:29,200
We shall learn and act accordingly.

184
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:34,360
Gundogdu, you shall go to
the moorland where we will settle.

185
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:40,160
Have the tribe settle there but be ready
for a war that might start anytime.

186
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:44,860
Deli Demir, you ready the weapons.

187
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,600
As you wish, my Bey.

188
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,460
What will we do now, Nasir?

189
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,500
What if Aftalia speaks?

190
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,230
You don’t know Aftalia, Titus.

191
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:24,000
She would never do anything to harm
the Templars, you can be rest assured.

192
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:29,360
You have still not learned that
you can never be sure about people, Nasir.

193
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,130
We cannot risk it.

194
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,830
We should find Aftalia and bring her back,
whatever the cost.

195
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,230
Dead or alive.

196
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,300
We are almost sure that they have kidnapped her
from the palace, right?

197
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,360
Has anything happened lately
that drew your attention?

198
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,160
Think a bit harder.

199
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
No. Nothing.

200
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,500
We took Ertugrul and
put him in the dungeon.

201
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,160
The rest was ordinary palace chores.

202
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,800
What about before?

203
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Wait!

204
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,930
Where are you taking these?

205
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,000
His highness Ameer and Leila Sultan’s
governess Ummulhayr Hanim ordered us...

206
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,100
...to change the carpets of the Harem.

207
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,400
Guard!

208
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,030
Bring the governess to me!

209
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,230
Nasir is looking for Esma
everywhere in the palace.

210
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,960
He will be aware of her absence soon.

211
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,230
Ertugrul...

212
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,030
...they tortured him in the dungeon.

213
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,800
-You...
-My brother, don’t!

214
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,800
We are not like them. We do not torture.

215
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:29,400
We do not owe our enemies
anything but justice.

216
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,860
There is more news.

217
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:42,960
Some people came to the lodge
from your tribe.

218
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,400
They said two young women and an old man.

219
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,960
They asked the bookseller about Ertugrul.

220
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,330
I am going.

221
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,130
Nasir...

222
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,960
...I told you not to be like Kara Toygar.

223
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,400
But you are suffocated in your illiteracy.

224
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:11,200
I hope you can change
some things before it is too late.

225
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,330
I give you my respects, Commander Nasir.

226
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,600
What am I doing here, Commander?

227
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,300
Are you interrogating me?

228
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,600
How can I do such a thing,
Ummulhayr Hanim?

229
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:59,130
You are the mother of this palace.
How can you say that?

230
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,600
There is only one small issue
that stuck on my mind.

231
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,160
-I wanted to consult you about that.
-Do ask, I am listening.

232
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:13,830
Did you recently give an order to donate
the old carpets of the palace to the poor?

233
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,060
We continuously donate the old items in
the palace to the poor...

234
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,430
...but I have not given
such an order recently.

235
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,600
Moreover, you know me, Commander...

236
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,160
...I do these charity work without showing off.

237
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,560
Of course we know this, governess. You are
the soul of Aleppo carved from a jewel.

238
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,200
The protective wing of Aleppo’s poor.

239
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,400
I do apologize for my inconvenience.

240
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,330
Please.

241
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,500
You can go back to your quarters.

242
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:15,000
Guard!

243
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,860
Prepare your regiment immediately.

244
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:33,260
To a city where Ertugrul is in chains,
where even the Alps cannot escape...

245
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,230
...how could you send Gokce?

246
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,100
Selcan! Gokce volunteered to go.

247
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,030
Have you forgotten that
our women are as brave as our men?

248
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,230
Do not worry. Nothing will happen to them.

249
00:27:55,330 --> 00:28:00,800
Would Deli Demir leave them and return
if they were in an insecure place?

250
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:06,200
Mother Hayme, Gokce is my only companion.

251
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,360
If she is gone as well...

252
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,130
...how can I bear this pain?

253
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,230
Do not fear.

254
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,830
Selcan, look at me.

255
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,430
Nothing will happen to them.
Do you understand?

256
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,060
Do not fear.

257
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,700
God is the Greatest, God is the Greatest

258
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:15,020
God is the Greatest, God is the Greatest

259
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,500
My vizier, you can tell
anything to this lad.

260
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:26,230
He would even forget the message himself
after he delivers it.

261
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,560
There are a few men that I trust in the
palace. You will tell them where we are.

262
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:36,330
They will whisper our location to
Ertugrul and he can manage the rest.

263
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,430
Come on, lads, let’s do this.

264
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,460
Great God!

265
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,460
Stop! What are you doing?

266
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,930
We have to leave immediately. Wear
the guard’s uniform. We have to hurry.

267
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,330
Stop!

268
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,960
Where are you taking that?

269
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,400
What is inside it?

270
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,330
Put it down!

271
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,400
Great God!

272
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,900
Aykutluk.

273
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:54,400
My vizier, you should leave.

274
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,800
My vizier, you should leave,
we will take care of him.

275
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,300
Go!

276
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,830
My vizier, please go.

277
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,830
My vizier, go! Come on!

278
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,360
This way.

279
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,360
Go inside here, my Bey.

280
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,330
God damn it!

281
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,830
Guards! Guards!

282
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,130
He shall not even stick
his nose out of the palace...

283
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,860
...or I will have all of you executed,
understand?

284
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,300
Go!

285
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,400
Halime?

286
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:57,000
Where is Leila Sultan, my girl?

287
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,560
I did not see her this morning, governess.

288
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,130
Where is she?

289
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,160
Girls!

290
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,960
Search the Harem immediately. Find Leila
Sultan wherever she is and inform me.

291
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,400
As you wish.

292
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,900
Governess, why are you so worried?

293
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:30,100
His highness loves his sister very much.
He wants to know every move of her.

294
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:33,160
What am I going to do?

295
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,300
This is all I can do, my Bey.

296
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,060
Go down this hall.

297
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,260
It will take you to Nasir’s room.

298
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:00,560
This is a very dangerous plan,
may God be on your side.

299
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,330
-As Aykutluk said, you are a brave man.
-Thank you.

300
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,060
You fools. God damn you all!

301
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,960
Commander, we have found
two of our guards’ dead.

302
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,560
Get out!
Get out and find that man, get out!

303
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,560
Did I make you angry?

304
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,600
What do you want, Ertugrul?

305
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,200
Everyone in Aleppo to know who you are!

306
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,860
Then you have to kill me.

307
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,830
Because no one can break my sealed lips.

308
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,200
Why?

309
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,300
Are you going to poison yourself
and die like a foaming rabid dog?

310
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,960
I don’t think so, Nasir.

311
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,500
You are a coward dog.

312
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,200
You should see your own face. It is
as white as the shroud of the Sultan.

313
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:02,860
You still haven’t seen that great power
you are fighting against, right?

314
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:07,830
I will destroy you and
your reckless tribe to the last man.

315
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,600
I’m not afraid of being killed.

316
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:16,130
I have seen the drooling bodies of your
dogs that were after me, so many times.

317
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,600
I even lost count.

318
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,560
I don’t think you are as devoted as
those dogs of yours, Nasir.

319
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,060
When it comes to killing you...

320
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:31,860
...one more or one less.
It makes no difference to me.

321
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,360
If you hurt me...

322
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:42,030
...Shahzada’s daughter Halime,
for whom you went all into this trouble...

323
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,100
Do you think we are stupid, Ertugrul?

324
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,600
We know everything.

325
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,160
If something happens to me...

326
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,600
...Shahzada’s daughter Halime,
her brother who is our prisoner...

327
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,900
...and your Alp Turgut...

328
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,960
...may turn up dead.

329
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:10,530
I already took my precautions, Ertugrul.

330
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,240
I have countless men in this palace
who would take Halime’s life...

331
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,240
...that Titus couldn’t succeed with his arrow.

332
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,800
I am not even counting
the ones in Kayi.

333
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,100
What happened, Ertugrul?
Have you changed your mind about killing me?

334
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:36,900
Go on, kill me.

335
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:40,060
What are you waiting for?
Kill me, Ertugrul!

336
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,930
I will expose the people
who made you do this one by one.

337
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,300
Then...

338
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,500
...may God be my witness that I shall
kill you with my own hands, Nasir.
