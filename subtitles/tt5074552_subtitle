Ripped by gdhaliwal23

2
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:08,375
Presenting that powerful personality..

3
00:01:08,958 --> 00:01:15,125
..who has changed
the political scenario of Punjab.

4
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:22,416
Please welcome The One
and only Yudhveer Singh Sidhu.

5
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,500
Yudhveer!

6
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:29,875
Yudhveer!

7
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:33,416
Yudhveer!

8
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:39,125
There are two paths to success.

9
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,750
There is a slow, long route.

10
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:45,458
And then, there is a shortcut.

11
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:53,750
Political stalwarts
always exploit naivety.

12
00:01:59,166 --> 00:02:01,541
I am only here to tell you..

13
00:02:01,625 --> 00:02:04,000
He has a gift of gab.
Brains and then some.

14
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:07,375
I am not some rich,
cosseted politician..

15
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:12,208
..who sits in an air-conditioned
room and decides the future..

16
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,208
..of those who toil hard
under the scorching sun.

17
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:20,166
Long live Yudhveer!

18
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,125
You dog!

19
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,375
No matter how old a camel is, it will
never learn how to pee! Give it here.

20
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,541
- There are two of them here.
- What?

21
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,291
Camels.

22
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:46,625
I will shoot you.
Give it here.

23
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,666
Everyone knows that
I never miss my target.

24
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,666
And that I always keep my word.

25
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:07,416
I didn't learn politics from books.

26
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,083
Nor by following any leader.

27
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,625
I am that farmer's son..

28
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:19,708
..who lived and died for others.

29
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:40,916
From my father,
Mr. Gurdev Singh..

30
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,916
..taught me that..

31
00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,583
..you can only help those..

32
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,041
..who can help themselves.

33
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:12,500
This world belongs to the
powerful who exploit the Weak.

34
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,583
It's very difficult to say
how the 'Lok Seva Party'..

35
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:27,000
..will handle this university scam.

36
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:31,958
We can see that it's very difficult
to calm down these students.

37
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:34,708
We want Justice.

38
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,208
We want Justice.

39
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:42,916
(Students protesting)

40
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,500
We want Justice.

41
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:47,541
- We want Justice.
- Stay inside.

42
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:52,166
Can't you hear the horn?

43
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,958
Go and sit in the car.

44
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,833
We won't be stopping.

45
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,125
Hail student union!

46
00:04:59,208 --> 00:05:00,750
- Hail student union!
- This is not your house.

47
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:02,333
Give way.

48
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:03,333
I will show you the way.

49
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,666
You should direct your
anger towards the government.

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,083
It is not smart to
hurt the populace.

51
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,833
Your party's leaders
are the smart ones.

52
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,958
They are playing
with students' future.

53
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:22,333
Your greed for money
is ruining our hard work.

54
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:26,208
We will stop only after
your party's dominion ends.

55
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:28,750
How will that benefit you?

56
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,791
If you want to stop something
then stop corruption.

57
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,666
I agree you have been cheated.

58
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:36,416
Trust me. I support all of you.

59
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:37,916
But only in a peaceful manner.

60
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,791
Such destruction will
only trouble a commoner.

61
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:44,166
We don't want
your sugar-coated words.

62
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:45,583
What are you waiting for?

63
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:55,541
I promise you that all those
who have cheated you will be punished.

64
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:57,458
All of you will get what
rightfully belongs to you.

65
00:06:00,416 --> 00:06:01,250
Ma'am, you may go.

66
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,916
Keep it where
you took it from.

67
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:17,000
I am known in the political
scenario by my white turban.

68
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:22,791
And the education scam
is tainting my image.

69
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:27,666
Sir, rather than
discussing the trouble..

70
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:31,958
..we should be discussing
to find a solution.

71
00:06:33,125 --> 00:06:38,000
I will have to discuss about
the trouble and the troublemakers.

72
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:42,375
He is right, uncle.

73
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,083
Daman, I am your uncle at home.

74
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,375
We are here to discuss
the problem our party is facing.

75
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:55,458
Both run smoothly if you
keep family and politics separate.

76
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,083
If you really have to cross the
river then its depth doesn't matter.

77
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,291
What do you mean?

78
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:08,291
I mean, this is a serious problem.

79
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:13,000
But should we give up on coming
to the power next time because of it?

80
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,833
Not at any cost, Yudhveer.

81
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,458
But, what can we do
under such circumstances?

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,375
Form an enquiry commission.

83
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:23,500
Suspend all the senior officers
in the department.

84
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:25,375
You give a public apology.

85
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,416
And the most important thing..

86
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,041
..the education minister's resignation.

87
00:07:31,125 --> 00:07:32,125
What nonsense!

88
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,166
Daman.

89
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,083
What are you trying to say?

90
00:07:36,125 --> 00:07:37,333
Is everything that easy?

91
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:42,916
You have to shuffle
a few positions to save 40.

92
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,000
This is just a suggestion.

93
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,291
No matter what you decide..

94
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,416
..I will always support you.

95
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,000
Yudhveer..

96
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,750
..I trust you and I respect you.

97
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,208
Thank you, sir.

98
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,791
Trust and respect,
you have to earn them both in life.

99
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,375
Manvi, you come just now.

100
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,000
You should be resting.

101
00:08:22,208 --> 00:08:24,333
We have servants
to do all these things.

102
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,958
My dear papa..

103
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:29,708
..servants have been cooking
for you since the past five years.

104
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,000
You just enjoy your food.

105
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:43,458
How can anyone enjoy a
pudding if you add salt in it?

106
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,458
Excuse me! I have added salt to it,
but not in excess.

107
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:51,083
She has an answer for everything.

108
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,375
She too will become a leader like you.

109
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,625
Grandmother, he is
the one who saved me.

110
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,000
That's Yudhveer Singh.

111
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,875
From the 'Lok Seva Party'.

112
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:03,666
Wow. There are quite a few
young politicians these days.

113
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,166
You were born late, dear.

114
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,708
I was 22 years old
when I joined politics.

115
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:13,291
I mean to say, they
are intelligent.

116
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,833
Educated leaders.

117
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:20,041
Mother, please show her
my post-graduation certificate.

118
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,500
That's not what she means, son.

119
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:27,166
She means many handsome
boys have joined politics.

120
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,083
By the way, you will
have to agree with me on this.

121
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:35,083
There is no one as intelligent
and smart as my father.

122
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:37,083
After all, he is my son.

123
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:41,916
Yudhveer, you are a
donkey for this party.

124
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,833
They always put you
in sticky situations.

125
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,916
You too should drink a little today.

126
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:51,583
Thanks, but no thanks.

127
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:54,750
My brain works faster
with a fresh cup of tea.

128
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,250
One thing is for certain.

129
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:00,583
Party will make you
the Chief or something.

130
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,166
Chief is a lot of power.

131
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,875
Power? I don't
want to be a Chief.

132
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,291
I always aim for
the cherry on the top.

133
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,875
I don't want something
that just falls on my lap.

134
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,458
This means..

135
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,250
CM of the state.

136
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,666
Cheers.

137
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:30,833
Don't you think it's more important
to serve the people than be in power?

138
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:32,416
Point.

139
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:38,833
<i>Son, for me,</i>
<i>politics means public service.</i>

140
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,041
What can I say
about the people?

141
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:51,041
They are used to voting and
then facing the official baton.

142
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:54,333
Do you want a baton? Start drinking.

143
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:16,375
<i>"Oh my beloved,</i>
<i>this is our first meeting."</i>

144
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:22,000
<i>"Today, we spoke through our eyes."</i>

145
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:27,291
<i>"I swear, love knows no differences."</i>

146
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:32,916
<i>"For me, love is God."</i>

147
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:48,500
<i>"Oh my beloved, I see God in you."</i>

148
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,666
<i>"Please, never go away from me."</i>

149
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:59,208
<i>"This is what I pray for."</i>

150
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:03,916
<i>"I shall always be with you."</i>

151
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:14,791
Hi.

152
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,333
- Hello.
- I am so glad I got to see you.

153
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:18,041
Yes?

154
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,166
I mean how are you doing?

155
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,375
I am absolutely fine.
How about you?

156
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:23,958
I too am absolutely fine.
I am good.

157
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:25,666
- Bye.
- Bye.

158
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,750
Plans of joining Randhava's party,
by any chance?

159
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,208
Please give 60 rupees.

160
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,083
I don't have change.

161
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,875
I don't even have bangles
worth a thousand here.

162
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:48,791
- No.
- What happened?

163
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,291
I don't have change.

164
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:51,916
- How much?
- 60 rupees.

165
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,125
Such commotion over so little money?
Here you go.

166
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:58,166
Thank you.

167
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,541
Thanks. You can keep this.

168
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,000
I don't have change either.

169
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:05,000
I think I have change.

170
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,166
Keep your ATM to yourself.

171
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:10,791
Can't you see two opposing parties
getting together at a beautiful place?

172
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,000
Why are you opening your bank here?

173
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,791
At such an occasion, you should make an
excuse of leaving your wallet at home.

174
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:15,958
Right, Mr. Sidhu?

175
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:19,875
Look, I think she is honest.

176
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:22,916
She will surely come over
one day to return the money.

177
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:26,000
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

178
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:48,333
<i>"Our love is my lifeline."</i>

179
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,958
<i>"I cannot survive without love."</i>

180
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,708
<i>"I keep awake all night."</i>

181
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,458
<i>"I yearn to be in your company."</i>

182
00:13:56,625 --> 00:14:01,958
<i>"You need to follow</i>
<i>the traditions of love."</i>

183
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:07,083
<i>"You have to dance</i>
<i>to cajole your beloved."</i>

184
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:12,541
<i>"You need to follow</i>
<i>the traditions of love."</i>

185
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:17,958
<i>"You have to dance</i>
<i>to cajole your beloved."</i>

186
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:22,916
<i>"Like the stars and</i>
<i>the moon go hand in hand."</i>

187
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,333
<i>"Like the fragrance</i>
<i>always follows the flowers."</i>

188
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:33,625
<i>"Love has different rules."</i>

189
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:39,166
<i>"You have to accept</i>
<i>your beloved sorrows."</i>

190
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:52,375
<i>"You dwell in my eyes.</i>
<i>You reside in my heart."</i>

191
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,625
<i>"There is no one like you."</i>

192
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:57,500
<i>"You dwell in my eyes.</i>
<i>You reside in my heart."</i>

193
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,916
<i>"There is no one like you."</i>

194
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,666
Hi!

195
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,833
- Hi! What a pleasant surprise.
- Yeah.

196
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,416
You don't jog.

197
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:05,833
At least let me jog.

198
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,458
Come on, get up and run!

199
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,625
Why should I run?
I didn't steal anything.

200
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:15,541
Let the people sleep, Lord Indra.

201
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,958
You sleep at home, here you run.

202
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:20,750
Get lost.

203
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,291
First, get up early in the morning.
Then go for a run.

204
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,958
Then become slim.

205
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:27,541
Then go to the market
and buy new clothes.

206
00:15:27,791 --> 00:15:29,000
Who wants so much trouble?

207
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,375
You too shouldn't run.

208
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,666
Let me go. Veer is alone.
Get up.

209
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:35,250
Who said he is alone?

210
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,958
Look, he is making
his move there.

211
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,333
- Hello.
- Hello.

212
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,583
- Hello.
- Hello.

213
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,375
What brings you here
so early in the morning?

214
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:49,125
I had come to repay the money,
the 60 rupees.

215
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,250
- That day at the stall?
- Oh yes.

216
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:54,666
She was insisting.
I told her it is not necessary.

217
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,541
Don't you think it's
too early for that?

218
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:59,208
I mean, it is not
that big an amount..

219
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,125
..that you didn't even wait
for the sun to raise to return it.

220
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:01,916
What?

221
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,666
I mean take it.
What are you waiting for?

222
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,083
What are you saying?
Take it.

223
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:06,125
- Give it here.
- Hey!

224
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:11,666
I have been noticing. She
is insisting and you are resisting.

225
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,708
Give her 40 rupees back.

226
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,750
I came here for a run.

227
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,208
I don't carry my wallet with me.

228
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:18,250
Dimpy, do you have change?

229
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:19,625
Look, whether I run or
don't that doesn't matter..

230
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:21,208
..but I come here with that intention.

231
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:23,750
She is different.
She carries cash with her.

232
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:24,541
What?

233
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,708
I mean you had borrowed
60 rupees from him.

234
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,416
Now you want to pay him back.
You gave him 100 rupees.

235
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,458
We don't have 40 rupees change.
You have given us 100 rupees.

236
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:34,208
- You owe her 40 rupees now.
- Bye.

237
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:35,666
You can come some day
to take that 40 rupees.

238
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,875
Or he will come over to give you back.
Turn around. Where are you going.

239
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:45,583
People lie when they
say that leaders don't work.

240
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,125
They will know when they will
have to attend so many meetings.

241
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,708
During the wedding season..

242
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,208
..even Gippy and Diljit
aren't as much in demand..

243
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,125
..as much as our friend
is during the election season.

244
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,291
Party's emergency meeting.

245
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,625
That means the party is in trouble.

246
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:06,083
During such occasions, you can
prove how better you are than others.

247
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,041
That's why I love such occasions.

248
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,666
- Have a seat, Yudhveer.
- Hello.

249
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,541
We were waiting for you.

250
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:29,125
The agenda of this meeting
is Gill group of companies' owner..

251
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,708
..Jagbeer Singh Gill.

252
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,916
Because of the Education scam,
center has stopped the construction..

253
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:39,541
..of the 1000 crore rupees
worth Technical university.

254
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:44,250
That university's contract
was given to Gill.

255
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:48,500
He is upset with us and
has refused to give party funds.

256
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,166
How can he refuse?

257
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,166
I will go and teach
him a lesson tomorrow.

258
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Daman!

259
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:58,875
We are discussing politics here
and not bidding on bar construction.

260
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:05,333
If we follow your steps
then we will never be in power.

261
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,625
Sir, if you permit,
can I talk to Gill?

262
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:13,083
Yes, you should talk to him.

263
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:16,416
I don't make tall claims.

264
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,958
I will convince Gill and make
him talk to you tomorrow itself.

265
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,708
- Goodbye.
- Yudhveer, sit.

266
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:28,583
I was just like you
when I was of your age.

267
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,000
Thank you.

268
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:36,375
Daman!

269
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,041
No, sir.

270
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,791
You weren't like me.

271
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,166
You are a decent man now.

272
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,208
And you were a decent
man back then as well.

273
00:18:48,291 --> 00:18:49,416
But I am..

274
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:01,583
He has refused party fund
to our party and punctured us.

275
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:04,083
And here he is soaring
high in the sky.

276
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:12,375
No matter how high you fly,
you have to come down in the end.

277
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,291
Wait here. I will be right back.

278
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,458
- Yudhveer.
- Sir.

279
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,375
Why are you standing
so far away like a stranger?

280
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,833
Come closer and give me a hug.

281
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,666
I was standing far
away because I think..

282
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,958
..you have thrown us
out of your friend's list.

283
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:57,541
And you don't seem quite
happy when I am close to you.

284
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:04,000
To come and to be sent
are two different things.

285
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:07,541
And the difference
is there between you and me..

286
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:12,083
..and me and the 'Lok Seva Party'.

287
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:15,791
Just a little..

288
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,916
..it is a very cruel thing, Mr. Gill.

289
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,458
Enough to change
a victory into loss.

290
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:26,458
This little causes a big difference.

291
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,833
Yudhveer Singh Sidhu who
always talks about victory..

292
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:37,291
..does he fear
a loss by any chance?

293
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,333
I don't think you understand me,
Mr. Gill.

294
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,583
You are making
assumptions.

295
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,458
Everyone salutes a rising star.

296
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:52,791
Only goats follow the herd.

297
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:56,083
From when did you start following?

298
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:59,458
I cannot spend 200
crores to watch a drama.

299
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,583
It is not in my nature
to bet on a losing horse.

300
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,666
You should bet on the
jockey and not on the horse.

301
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:11,375
It doesn't take long
to change the jockey.

302
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:22,291
Our political player is
playing a game of chess.

303
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,541
I wonder what move
he is going to make.

304
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,791
Come on.

305
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:36,750
I am thinking of killing
the king without killing any pawns.

306
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,291
Is that possible?

307
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:47,833
The CM that his job is done.

308
00:21:50,291 --> 00:21:51,916
Hello? Hi, sir.

309
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:56,125
Sir, how it is possible that I don't
do a job that you have given me?

310
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,416
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you very much.

311
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:01,541
Thank you.

312
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:08,291
Don't you think the king
is stopping you from moving ahead?

313
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,000
Then find a solution.

314
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,000
Found it.

315
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:24,625
Hey!

316
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:41,625
<i>Punjab's CM, Mr. Gurpyaar Singh's</i>
<i>sudden death in a road accident..</i>

317
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:44,458
<i>..has come as a shock</i>
<i>to the entire state.</i>

318
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,666
<i>This accident took place</i>
<i>at Ludhiana-Firozpur highway..</i>

319
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,000
<i>..near Jagrao where</i>
<i>a truck hit his car.</i>

320
00:22:51,166 --> 00:22:52,541
<i>The truck driver is missing.</i>

321
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:56,166
<i>With his spotless personality</i>
<i>and people favorable politics..</i>

322
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,833
<i>..Mr. Gurpyaar Singh reined the Punjab's</i>
<i>political senior for a decade.</i>

323
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:04,541
<i>Now we have to see</i>
<i>who will fill the..</i>

324
00:23:04,625 --> 00:23:07,875
<i>..most important seat</i>
<i>of the 'Lok Seva Party'.</i>

325
00:23:08,041 --> 00:23:11,208
<i>Gurpyaar Singh's renowned</i>
<i>nephew Damanjeet Singh..</i>

326
00:23:11,375 --> 00:23:15,791
<i>..or his favorite,</i>
<i>Mr. Yudhveer Singh?</i>

327
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:23,083
During these elections,
our party will be led by..

328
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,666
..Damanjeet Singh.

329
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,375
And if our party wins..

330
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:37,041
..Damanjeet Singh will be
our candidate for the post of CM.

331
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,666
Why are you laughing, Yudhveer?

332
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:49,750
I am bound to laugh when
you crack a joke, Chief.

333
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:53,791
Are we deciding about
someone's ancestral shop?

334
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,541
"Father's dead so now the
shop will belong to the son."

335
00:23:56,708 --> 00:23:59,833
- Right?
- Stop dreaming.

336
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,791
You joined the party
only seven years ago.

337
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:06,458
I have got politics in my blood.

338
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:10,333
You don't even know
what the color of blood is.

339
00:24:10,416 --> 00:24:12,750
Mind your language.

340
00:24:12,833 --> 00:24:14,375
You quietly sit in your crib.

341
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,833
Act smartly.

342
00:24:16,125 --> 00:24:17,958
We can decide who
will become the CM later.

343
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:22,916
First, see whether our party can
win enough seats to form a government.

344
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,125
We will win for sure.

345
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,166
How can you say that, Yudhveer?

346
00:24:26,583 --> 00:24:31,791
Have I never kept my word?

347
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,208
So Chief, is there anyone else here
who is so confident about himself?

348
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:49,125
It's decided then.

349
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:52,625
Yudhveer will lead these elections.

350
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:57,000
If the party wins in his leadership..

351
00:24:57,375 --> 00:25:00,458
..then Yudhveer Singh will be the CM.

352
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,583
What if our party loses
because of Yudhveer?

353
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,666
It is so easy to say
that Yudhveer will be the CM.

354
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:09,708
Did you take the party's opinion?

355
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,458
Daman.

356
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:20,666
Talk to the birds
to know about the clouds.

357
00:25:21,083 --> 00:25:22,541
Party should decide right away..

358
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,958
..who does it want
as its CM candidate.

359
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,583
We will know right away.

360
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:29,291
All the party members
are present here.

361
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:31,625
All those who want Yudhveer to be..

362
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,833
..our party's CM candidate
should raise their hand.

363
00:25:55,541 --> 00:25:58,166
Everyone expect a few members..

364
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:04,333
..want Yudhveer
to be our CM candidate.

365
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:09,333
So, with consensus,
I pass this judgment.

366
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,541
Thank you so much.

- People's Party.

379
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,500
You are pasting other
people's posters.

380
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:46,416
It is my livelihood.

381
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,750
- Shut up.
- It's my job.

382
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,458
You are putting
the opposition's posters.

383
00:27:49,541 --> 00:27:52,000
If I don't work,
how will I earn?

384
00:27:52,083 --> 00:27:54,666
You are arguing with me? You..

385
00:27:54,958 --> 00:27:55,791
Stop.

386
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,583
- What are you doing?
- Stay there.

387
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:00,500
Now you will tell me
what I should do?

388
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,291
I will, if you don't know.

389
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,875
Think twice before
raising your hand, Daman.

390
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:09,541
The power you are so proud of,
these hands have given you that power.

391
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:14,375
If these hands show you their
power on the day of election..

392
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:17,625
..then no one will listen to you
even if you fold your hands and beg.

393
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:23,541
There is a joke,
if you need to feed dry grass..

394
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:25,208
..make the donkey
wear green glasses.

395
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,083
Everything will look green to him.

396
00:28:27,666 --> 00:28:29,000
Change the color

This isn't about new or old.

We are talking about our right,
the truth and justice.

412
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,666
Politics doesn't exists on mere words.

413
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,291
Politics needs thoughts.

414
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:41,125
And age and experiences
give you better thoughts.

415
00:29:41,208 --> 00:29:44,458
You might need experience
to do politics.

416
00:29:44,791 --> 00:29:48,083
But you don't need any
experience to help others.

417
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,208
What do we need to succeed in life?

418
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:59,125
Knowledge, talent,
wealth, happiness.

419
00:29:59,791 --> 00:30:05,416
We cannot think about these
things without respecting women.

420
00:30:06,083 --> 00:30:09,625
And as we stay in Punjab,
there is nothing greater than that.

421
00:30:09,958 --> 00:30:12,000
Because it is also mentioned
in the Granth Sahib..

422
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:15,708
.."So why call her bad?
From her, kings are born."

423
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:16,791
Applause!

424
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:22,625
Please, please.

425
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:24,208
Please sit down.

426
00:30:24,375 --> 00:30:28,833
When we will start respecting
the females in our house..

427
00:30:28,916 --> 00:30:35,000
..it will bring about
a good change in our society.

428
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,666
Someone has rightly said..

429
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:44,125
.."A man, without a woman, is like
a tree without branches or leaves."

430
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,041
Applause!

431
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:52,416
Goodbye.

432
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:55,625
What happened to them?

433
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:58,833
Someone treat them,
they come everywhere.

434
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:01,958
We can treat humans, not them.

435
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,750
Have some shame!

436
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:06,166
I just spoke about
respecting women.

437
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,791
Brother, at least ask for our votes.
How will you win otherwise?

438
00:31:09,708 --> 00:31:12,000
Those who ask don't
have a right to win.

439
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:14,666
I don't want your vote,
I just want your love.

440
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,166
Thank you very much.

441
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:19,166
Hail Yudhveer!

442
00:31:19,875 --> 00:31:22,375
Hail Yudhveer!

443
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:26,375
Hello, grandmother.

444
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,833
- Hello.
- Hello.

445
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:30,333
What is wrong with her?

446
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,041
She has cancer.

447
00:31:32,625 --> 00:31:34,958
If she has cancer,
why isn't she in the hospital?

448
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:36,333
For what have government
build hospitals?

449
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,375
No one listens to the poor.

450
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,458
Nor do the poor have any money.

451
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:46,041
Dimpy, Inder, take her
to the hospital.

452
00:31:47,083 --> 00:31:47,875
All right?

453
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:51,416
If you are troubled
in any government office..

454
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:54,583
..or if your work isn't
being done then tell me.

455
00:31:54,875 --> 00:31:56,583
I will come with you.

456
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,583
How about asking for votes, brother?

457
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,625
I haven't come here to ask for votes.

458
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:04,708
I have come here
to ask for your support.

459
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:08,666
With your support and
our government's hard work..

460
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:10,250
..we are slowly progressing forward.

461
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:14,625
But we have a long way to
go and hence we need your support.

462
00:32:15,041 --> 00:32:15,833
Thank you very much.

463
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:19,125
Hail Yudhveer!

464
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,875
Long live, Yudhveer!

465
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,333
Long live, Yudhveer!

466
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:39,833
This is not about me,
it's about Punjab..

467
00:33:18,416 --> 00:33:20,041
I know.

468
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:26,875
I know this quite well,
how the opposition is trying hard..

469
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
..to ruin our party's image.

470
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:34,541
But all of you know
this quite well that..

471
00:33:34,708 --> 00:33:40,208
..our late CM Gurpyaar
Singh was a good..

472
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:43,500
..honest and a noble man.

473
00:33:43,791 --> 00:33:47,875
And I have vowed
to follow his footsteps.

474
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:49,083
What is wrong with it?

475
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:50,458
Why isn't it working?

476
00:33:50,708 --> 00:33:54,500
That's why you should always
test your friends and weapons.

477
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,333
Shut up.

478
00:33:56,541 --> 00:33:59,416
We have a heritage of sacrifices.

479
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:02,458
We can sacrifice ourselves
for the poor and needy.

480
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:05,500
We have been brought up
by brave women like Mother Bhago.

481
00:34:05,583 --> 00:34:08,000
We can even burn
a stone with our anger.

482
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,458
You dog!

483
00:34:18,875 --> 00:34:21,250
No matter how old a camel is,
it will never learn how to pee!

484
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:22,125
Give it here.

485
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:24,166
- There are two of them here.
- What?

486
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,000
Camels.

487
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,083
I will shoot you.
Give it here.

488
00:34:39,833 --> 00:34:43,375
Be careful. Make it look clean.

489
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:47,500
Everyone knows that
I never miss my target.

490
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:50,791
And that I always keep my word.

491
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,875
That's good.
Good luck.

492
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:55,500
Long live, Yudhveer!

493
00:34:58,875 --> 00:35:03,000
I didn't learn politics from books.

494
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:05,500
Nor by following any leader.

495
00:35:06,625 --> 00:35:08,833
I am that farmer's son..

496
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:14,833
..who lived and died for others.

497
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:22,208
You are a disgrace!

498
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,125
From my father..

499
00:35:29,958 --> 00:35:31,833
..Mr. Gurdev Singh..

500
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,416
..taught me..

501
00:35:40,708 --> 00:35:43,541
..that you can only help those..

502
00:35:45,125 --> 00:35:47,416
..who can help themselves.

503
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,041
This world belongs to--

504
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,125
Yudhveer!

505
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:08,541
Yudhveer!

506
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,125
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's take him. Keep moving forward.

507
00:36:19,375 --> 00:36:20,166
Ambulance!

508
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:23,625
Son, for me,
politics means public service.

509
00:36:23,708 --> 00:36:24,833
Keep moving. Come on!

510
00:36:25,083 --> 00:36:25,666
We have reached the hospital.

511
00:36:25,916 --> 00:36:27,208
I haven't come here
to ask for votes.

512
00:36:27,291 --> 00:36:28,250
I have come
for your support.

513
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:48,666
Hey, get up.

514
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,208
You call yourself a sharpshooter.

515
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:55,875
How did he survive?

516
00:36:56,666 --> 00:36:58,375
Brother, I didn't shoot him.

517
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:01,291
What did you say?

518
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:05,875
What happened?

519
00:37:08,208 --> 00:37:10,833
There's another pawn in the game?

520
00:37:14,541 --> 00:37:16,500
Yes. Ok, I'll call you back.

521
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,791
The media is here.

522
00:37:21,833 --> 00:37:22,666
All right.

523
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:30,500
There is nothing to worry about.

524
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:33,291
Rest for a few days
and you will be fine.

525
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,208
Ok?

526
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,583
Welcome. The Star Reporter
Ms. Anjali.

527
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:41,250
What's happening?

528
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,916
- Nothing.
- Really?

529
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,666
You are climbing the
ladder of success. Right?

530
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:55,000
Excuse me, but a few of the steps in
your ladder were planted by me, right?

531
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,166
Yes, of course.

532
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,041
- We haven't refused that.
- No doubt.

533
00:37:58,125 --> 00:38:00,666
The left hand supports the right.
And the right supports the left.

534
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:04,041
You keep discussing about
Yudhveer on your channel.

535
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:07,250
If you ever need Yudhveer's
exclusive interview, call me.

536
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:10,416
I won't let the exclusive
run on any other channel.

537
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:11,583
Correct.

538
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,458
So can I go and meet him now?

539
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,750
- Now?
- Yes, but not right away.

540
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:15,458
Why?

541
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,083
He is taking rest.

542
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:20,458
For the time being keep running
this news on your channel..

543
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:26,250
..that a gun was used, a bullet
was shot and it nicked the arm.

544
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,875
Don't listen to this idiot.
He always gives half the information.

545
00:38:28,958 --> 00:38:29,916
Why so?

546
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,125
You can also run Yudhveer's
exclusive statement.

547
00:38:32,208 --> 00:38:34,208
- What do you mean?
- Yudhveer has said that..

548
00:38:34,291 --> 00:38:36,583
..there is no bullet..

549
00:38:36,666 --> 00:38:39,708
..which can come between
him and the people..

550
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:42,166
..and stop him from
serving the people.

551
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,458
- Clap.
- Wow.

552
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:44,750
Wow.

553
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,416
Hey! Yudhveer?

554
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:55,541
Wonderful.

555
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:59,000
The gun didn't cool down as yet
and the patient is already standing?

556
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:02,208
- Let's go.
- Wait for a while.

557
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:03,291
Rest a little.

558
00:39:04,541 --> 00:39:05,750
Yudhveer, what's the matter?

559
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,916
- Yudhveer!
- Hello.

560
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,458
This way.

561
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:46,416
I have to say,
your speech is worth listening to.

562
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:50,291
The phrases that you use!

563
00:39:50,958 --> 00:39:51,958
What was that?

564
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:58,541
"To plough a stone,
what art is that!"

565
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,541
"I haven't learnt
to make fake promises!"

566
00:40:01,708 --> 00:40:04,708
"I have learnt to sacrifice
my head from my Gurus and sages.."

567
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:08,541
"And I haven't learnt
to boast about such things!"

568
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,375
What happened?
The voting is in three days.

569
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,291
That will also
shut the Chief up.

570
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,791
Shut up, guys.

571
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,833
We are so happy that our
feet aren't touching the ground.

572
00:40:21,958 --> 00:40:24,458
And you are asking us to keep quiet?
We are going to be the CM.

573
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:25,666
- Stop the car.
- Why?

574
00:40:25,875 --> 00:40:27,625
- What happened?
- I said stop the car.

575
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:30,666
- Stop the car.
- Ok boss.

576
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:49,000
What's wrong with the network?

577
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:52,500
Hello!

578
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:53,875
Dimpy!

579
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:57,708
I'll call you back. Hello!

580
00:41:00,333 --> 00:41:02,250
Drive faster.
God knows where he is.

581
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,250
One ticket for Neelewaal.

582
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,291
- Sir?
- How much?

583
00:41:15,375 --> 00:41:17,791
- Why do you need a ticket?
- Give me a ticket, please.

584
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,375
No sir, I can't give you a ticket.

585
00:41:19,875 --> 00:41:20,958
Take the money.

586
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:23,291
- No sir, I can't take the money.
- Take the money.

587
00:41:23,833 --> 00:41:24,791
Ok, sir.

588
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:26,833
- Hello sir.
- Hello sir.

589
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,833
Here.

590
00:41:39,041 --> 00:41:40,833
Neelewaal bus stop.

591
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:21,375
Coming!

592
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,500
Son, you!

593
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,833
- I..
- Where were you?

594
00:42:26,916 --> 00:42:28,333
Why did you take so
long to open the door?

595
00:42:28,458 --> 00:42:29,208
I was working.

596
00:42:29,583 --> 00:42:30,458
Ok.

597
00:42:31,583 --> 00:42:33,666
This is a miracle.

598
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,500
What brings him here?

599
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,500
Shall I get water for you?

600
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,208
Water?

601
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,333
Yes.

602
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:53,291
Uncle Buta,
fill a bucket of water for me.

603
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:54,666
- I wish to have a bath.
- Ok.

604
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:58,500
Oh great, you guys are also here.

605
00:42:58,583 --> 00:43:00,000
This bud is blooming today.

606
00:43:01,208 --> 00:43:03,083
Our CM is over there.

607
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,208
Great.

608
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:08,916
As the propaganda has ended, he
has come to his village for a holiday.

609
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:12,083
If you wanted to go to the village,
you should have come with us.

610
00:43:12,166 --> 00:43:13,708
Do the seats of our car hurt you?

611
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:15,208
You came here in a crowded bus.

612
00:43:15,666 --> 00:43:16,708
Come, let's ask him.

613
00:43:20,666 --> 00:43:21,708
Yes, Jinder.

614
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,416
What?

615
00:43:27,791 --> 00:43:28,458
What happened, Veer?

616
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:30,208
Are you unwell?

617
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:36,166
- I think we will succeed.
- Water is ready, you can have a bath.

618
00:43:36,708 --> 00:43:39,458
Remember, now only Inder
or I will interact with the media.

619
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:41,666
What's your program?
Do you too wish to have a bath?

620
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,333
No. I am good.

621
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:46,000
We are going to succeed, boss.
Get ready.

622
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:47,958
Ok, fine.

623
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:49,500
Bye, Jinder.

624
00:43:50,416 --> 00:43:51,791
Congratulations.

625
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:53,291
We have succeeded.

626
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Our bullet scheme worked.

627
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:57,083
We are going strong in the
media at the moment.

628
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:57,916
Very good.

629
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,625
<i>The biggest contender</i>
<i>for the CM's post..</i>

630
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:06,541
<i>..and a renowned member</i>
<i>of the 'Lok Seva Party'..</i>

631
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:09,916
<i>..Yudhveer Singh Sidhu, the</i>
<i>attack on him during his election..</i>

632
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,791
<i>..rally has shocked everyone.</i>

633
00:44:11,958 --> 00:44:14,750
<i>If the one who attacked Yudhveer</i>
<i>isn't arrested within 24 hours..</i>

634
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,166
<i>..then we will seek revenge.</i>

635
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,875
<i>Yes, we will.</i>

636
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:23,083
<i>Mr. Yudhveer Singh Sidhu</i>
<i>from the beginning of his career..</i>

637
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:27,333
<i>..has stuck to his gun that</i>
<i>he won't keep any security with him.</i>

638
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:37,250
<i>For the time being, police</i>
<i>has no clue as to who attacked on him.</i>

639
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:41,166
<i>But it is obvious that</i>
<i>people are angry about this.</i>

640
00:44:41,333 --> 00:44:44,541
<i>And at the moment, the whole</i>
<i>of Punjab is chanting just one name.</i>

641
00:44:44,708 --> 00:44:47,541
<i>Yudhveer, we will turn</i>
<i>your dreams into reality.</i>

642
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:50,375
<i>Yudhveer, we will turn</i>
<i>your dreams into reality.</i>

643
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:53,458
<i>Yudhveer, we will turn</i>
<i>your dreams into reality.</i>

644
00:45:02,541 --> 00:45:04,416
Daman will leave India, right?

645
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:08,166
Where to, brother?

646
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:09,166
Fields.

647
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:13,375
Even the MC doesn't roam the
streets as freely as our CM does.

648
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:14,458
Let's go.

649
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:20,250
- Hello.
- Hello.

650
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,125
Yudhveer.

651
00:45:30,916 --> 00:45:32,000
Hello, uncle.

652
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,833
God bless you. You should try
warding off the evil from your head.

653
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:36,958
You are catching the
evil eye of the evil people.

654
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:39,250
Where are you going?

655
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:40,833
To the fields.

656
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:42,916
Go home and rest.

657
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,458
There is no storm
approaching there.

658
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:47,375
For how long will I
stay at home?

659
00:45:48,666 --> 00:45:50,166
What had to happen
has already happened.

660
00:45:50,791 --> 00:45:52,041
How is Karmo?

661
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,833
She is absolutely fine.

662
00:45:53,916 --> 00:45:56,625
She has gone to pick up
her son from the tuition class.

663
00:45:58,250 --> 00:45:59,166
Her son?

664
00:45:59,666 --> 00:46:01,250
You continue playing cards.

665
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:04,125
But when did that happen?
She had typhoid.

666
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:10,500
Let's go.

667
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:30,375
Well done, young man.

668
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:32,416
You have pleased me.

669
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,625
Well done. Give him more almonds.

670
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,958
Get lost! Increase his
exercise level.

671
00:46:42,041 --> 00:46:43,625
- Come on!
- Who is he?

672
00:46:43,708 --> 00:46:47,166
Brother,
he sells drugs in our village.

673
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,083
Ok.

674
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:53,041
You dog!

675
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:57,166
The youth are anyway no longer
interested in consuming milk.

676
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,791
And you are trying to
give them the dry white powder!

677
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:00,541
Tell me.

678
00:47:00,916 --> 00:47:01,833
Brother..

679
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,833
What is this?

680
00:47:04,666 --> 00:47:06,291
You should pay interest
to the ringtones you keep.

681
00:47:06,541 --> 00:47:07,333
Please forgive me, brother.

682
00:47:09,958 --> 00:47:10,791
No way.

683
00:47:11,541 --> 00:47:15,500
Your ears will keep ringing
for three months if I hit you once.

684
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,375
There is no way I will forgive you.

685
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:18,916
How can you even say that?

686
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,541
- Lift him up and take him inside.
-Let me go, brother.

687
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:22,833
I swear,
I will never sell drugs again.

688
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:23,750
Take him away..

689
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:27,583
- Please forgive me.
- Just don't crack his neck.

690
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:31,041
Drugs have ruined everyone.

691
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:35,208
Youth is wasted. They
didn't even spare ten-year-olds.

692
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:37,833
- I feel like killing them.
- Brother..

693
00:47:42,083 --> 00:47:43,833
Did the sun rise from the west?

694
00:47:44,333 --> 00:47:46,625
The cuckoos are
singing without spring?

695
00:47:48,708 --> 00:47:50,625
Forget it, Veer. Let's go.

696
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:54,458
Wait. What's the hurry?

697
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,333
Wait. You must be
tired asking for votes.

698
00:47:58,416 --> 00:48:00,333
You come to the village to rest.

699
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,208
It's not as if you are
worried about your village.

700
00:48:02,458 --> 00:48:03,750
You don't do any work, anyway.

701
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:07,125
What is he saying?

702
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:08,875
Let's go back home, Yudhveer.

703
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:13,250
We need to go back
on time and rest a little.

704
00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,875
Ok? Let's go.

705
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,541
Go back.

706
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:20,250
This village has stopped
giving importance to politics.

707
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:31,625
Listen.

708
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:33,791
Yes?

709
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,166
We had planted flowers here.
How did sugarcane grow here?

710
00:48:37,625 --> 00:48:38,458
Flowers?

711
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,791
This is sugarcane, sir.

712
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,833
If you say, I will
address them as flowers.

713
00:48:45,291 --> 00:48:46,458
- Bye.
- Bye.

714
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,250
Dimpy, what are they saying?

715
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:55,041
Why are saying stupid things?

716
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,416
Let's go home. We will go
there and talk. You are confused.

717
00:48:57,833 --> 00:48:59,666
Hello, brother. How are you?

718
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:00,750
Hello.

719
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:04,291
He is my son.

720
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,166
Come on, greet him.

721
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,250
- I won't.
- Your son?

722
00:49:08,041 --> 00:49:09,083
When did you get married?

723
00:49:10,333 --> 00:49:11,458
You had typhoid.

724
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,916
Typhoid?
I had typhoid seven years ago.

725
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,625
I have been married
for six years now.

726
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:19,750
You come back to the
village after so long that..

727
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:23,083
- Go home, dear.
- Take rest. Go.

728
00:49:23,166 --> 00:49:24,791
Ok, brother. Bye.
I'll get going.

729
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,250
Let's go home and talk.
Come with me.

730
00:49:26,333 --> 00:49:27,916
I had met uncle today.

731
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:36,083
What happened, brother?

732
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:38,166
Nihaal used to live here.

733
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,875
Nihaal died five years ago.

734
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:47,041
Where does Nihaal sleep?

735
00:49:47,958 --> 00:49:50,541
It's ok. Go home
and rest.

736
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:51,916
What is this nonsense!

737
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:55,041
Everyone is asking me to rest.
Am I unwell?

738
00:49:56,583 --> 00:49:57,583
Well..

739
00:50:26,208 --> 00:50:30,333
Manvi, I don't know what
to tell you and how to tell you.

740
00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:32,291
Dimpy?

741
00:50:37,541 --> 00:50:41,375
Manvi, Yudhveer fell
down after he was shot.

742
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:47,541
Ok Yudhveer, tell me what
has happened in the past few days.

743
00:50:50,291 --> 00:50:57,041
To understand your problem, you will
have to tell me everything in detail.

744
00:50:59,916 --> 00:51:03,041
My father Mr. Gurdev Singh..

745
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:05,000
Till the time our
demands are not met..

746
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:07,125
..we will protest
in a peaceful manner.

747
00:51:07,666 --> 00:51:12,125
He was a kind-hearted,
humanitarian farmer.

748
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,916
He never cared for his
life while helping others.

749
00:51:18,291 --> 00:51:20,250
Hello, Mr. Gurdev.
Your work will be done soon.

750
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,666
- Don't worry.
- Stop your drama.

751
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:25,708
What are you doing?

752
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:28,458
No!

753
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:35,375
<i>"When the time is right.."</i>

754
00:51:35,458 --> 00:51:41,000
<i>"..the truth reveals itself."</i>

755
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:47,458
I'll kill him If I'll see him again.

756
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:50,500
Father, I have told
you so many times..

757
00:51:50,958 --> 00:51:53,666
..that this dirty politics is
not for kindhearted people like you.

758
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:59,291
Son, for me,
politics means public service.

759
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:02,541
Taking someone's trouble on
your head is called public service?

760
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:06,291
I belong to them.

761
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:11,291
Whenever they will be mistreated,
I will support them.

762
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:16,666
Fine, then these very people will one
day show you how they return favors.

763
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:17,791
It's your wish.

764
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:21,208
<i>"He was True in the beginning.</i>
<i>He was True through all ages."</i>

765
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:25,000
This time father stood for
the village council's elections.

766
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:28,750
Baldev Singh stood against him.

767
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:34,458
Baldev Singh used money,
alcohol and drugs to influence people.

768
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:39,166
But still, he noticed that
he hasn't covered much ground.

769
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:45,875
Gurdev Singh! Search the place.

770
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:51,291

<i>"He is True even now.</i>
<i>He shall ever be True."</i>

776
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:18,250
Son, the police
arrested your father.

777
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,958
They said that he sold drugs.

778
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,875
The people whom my father
fought for all his life..

779
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:44,583
He didn't have the
courage to face them.

780
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:50,875
He was sad that he lost his battle..

781
00:53:51,458 --> 00:53:53,000
..or of being unable to change people.

782
00:53:54,750 --> 00:53:55,541
I don't know.

783
00:53:57,625 --> 00:54:00,958
But there was something
which troubled him.

<i>"A self-respecting</i>

786
00:54:14,041 --> 00:54:16,333
Shameless man!
You should drown yourself.

Father!

00:55:16,666 --> 00:55:17,375
What happened?

800
00:55:18,083 --> 00:55:19,375
Relax!

801
00:55:19,625 --> 00:55:20,958
- Rest.
- Relax.

<i>"He was true in the beginning.</i>
<i>He was true through all ages."</i>

806
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:31,458
No!

<i>"He shall always be true."</i>

808
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,083
No father!

Father!

813
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:58,041
When did this happen?

814
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,000
Two days ago.

815
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,583
For sure.

816
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,958
He has memory loss.

817
00:56:19,291 --> 00:56:20,666
Oh my God!

818
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:23,125
When did that incident
take place with his father?

819
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:26,166
Around seven years, doctor.

820
00:56:26,375 --> 00:56:28,291
But it was his arm which was injured.

821
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:29,416
Yes, doctor.

822
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:32,500
How can anyone lose his
memory if he is shot at his arm?

823
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:33,375
That's a point.

824
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:38,250
But tell me something,
was he standing after he was shot?

825
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:40,708
- No he--
- No, he fell.

826
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:55,375
Yudhveer joined politics to teach
a lesson to those who keep changing.

827
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:59,625
He only chose the path
which took him forward..

828
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:04,250
..whether pausing to find out
whether or not it was the right path.

829
00:57:06,291 --> 00:57:12,291
And today he has completely
forgotten seven years of his life.

830
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:16,458
How can we make him
the CM of the state..

831
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:20,041
..when he doesn't even remember
whether he was ever a part of politics.

832
00:57:21,208 --> 00:57:24,333
Anyway, at the point of
life where is standing right now..

833
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,583
..he really hates politics.

834
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,291
Doctor has warned us
that if we try to make Yudhveer..

835
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,708
..recall anything from the past..

836
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:39,875
..then it could pressurize his brain.

837
00:57:43,666 --> 00:57:44,875
It's the Chief.

838
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:46,041
Become Yudhveer.

839
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:47,583
That is strange. How do I..

840
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:52,166
Hello, Chief.

841
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:56,208
Yudhveer, switch on the television.

842
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,125
There is some breaking news.

843
00:58:00,791 --> 00:58:02,166
Especially for you.

844
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,291
<i>We have recently found out that</i>
<i>deceased Gurpyaar's road accident..</i>

845
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:11,083
<i>..wasn't an accident at all,</i>
<i>it could have been orchestrated.</i>

846
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,250
<i>Come, let's find out what</i>
<i>does 'Lok Seva Party's' Chief..</i>

847
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,833
<i>..and interim Chief Minister</i>
<i>Harbans Singh have to say about this.</i>

848
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:22,375
<i>We have formed an enquiry</i>
<i>commissioned to investigate.</i>

849
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:26,708
<i>Soon, we will know the truth.</i>

850
00:58:27,333 --> 00:58:30,916
<i>Only time will</i>
<i>tell what the truth is.</i>

851
00:58:31,666 --> 00:58:36,000
<i>If we come to think about it,</i>
<i>the first suspect..</i>

852
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:39,208
<i>..is the one who could</i>
<i>have benefited the most from it.</i>

853
00:58:39,458 --> 00:58:41,541
<i>What do you think Daman?</i>

854
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,875
<i>I know that by talking about</i>
<i>the one who would benefit the most..</i>

855
00:58:45,541 --> 00:58:48,208
<i>..you are pointing your fingers</i>
<i>towards Yudhveer Singh Sidhu.</i>

856
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,291
What nonsense!

857
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:52,166
<i>But it is not necessary</i>
<i>that he is behind this.</i>

858
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:54,666
You are being suspected.

859
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:59,041
Hence, the party cannot even
think about making you the CM.

860
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:04,791
They used Yudhveer to gather votes.

861
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:08,583
And now when we are talking
about the CM's position..

862
00:59:09,916 --> 00:59:11,833
..Chief is proposing Daman's name.

863
00:59:12,166 --> 00:59:15,166
Now that Yudhveer has reached
so close to his destination..

864
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,083
No, Manvi.

865
00:59:18,166 --> 00:59:20,875
Yudhveer Singh will
be the Chief Minister.

866
00:59:21,083 --> 00:59:22,000
In this condition?

867
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:24,166
Yes.

868
00:59:25,250 --> 00:59:26,208
Yes.

869
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:30,458
Only Yudhveer will become
the Chief Minister.

870
00:59:43,083 --> 00:59:46,750
This Yudhveer didn't even
let his father do politics.

871
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,458
So how will he do politics?

872
00:59:48,875 --> 00:59:51,541
If he is to be the CM
then he has to do politics.

873
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:53,458
No one will make an idler a CM.

874
00:59:53,708 --> 00:59:55,625
If idlers were to become
CM then in every village..

875
00:59:55,916 --> 00:59:59,208
..we would have 20 CMs sitting
under a tree playing cards.

876
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:03,000
But..

877
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:06,708
Politics is indeed a dirty job.

878
01:00:07,208 --> 01:00:08,750
Who says politics is dirty?

879
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:11,958
There can't be anything
cleaner than politics.

880
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:15,333
That's why people don't
want to wash their hands off it.

881
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:22,750
If the power goes in the
hands of people like Damanjeet..

882
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:26,291
..then our state will be in trouble.

883
01:00:28,875 --> 01:00:29,750
Don't worry.

884
01:00:30,666 --> 01:00:32,375
Our friend will become the CM.

885
01:00:32,791 --> 01:00:33,875
He should.

886
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:37,000
But he won't if you keep sitting here.
Go and talk to him.

887
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:39,416
Me?

888
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:42,208
Then who else?
Go and explain it to him.

889
01:00:42,791 --> 01:00:45,625
I can go and explain but..

890
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:48,750
We won't be able to do
it if you start doubting.

891
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:51,166
This will also be a
good test for your brains.

892
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:53,541
We will know if you
have anything in it or not.

893
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,791
Go and talk to him.
Why are you scared?

894
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:56,583
Ok.

895
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:58,291
Much better. Buck up.

896
01:00:58,416 --> 01:01:00,250
Buck up, boy. Come on.

897
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,833
- Yudhveer..
- Yes?

898
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:10,541
I wanted to talk to you.

899
01:01:11,333 --> 01:01:12,083
Yes, tell me.

900
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,875
You know the CM..

901
01:01:17,333 --> 01:01:19,000
..I mean the Chief Minister..

902
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:22,500
Have you come here to translate?

903
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:28,083
He has a lot of power.

904
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:30,000
He can do anything he wants.

905
01:01:30,375 --> 01:01:31,583
Anything he wants.

906
01:01:31,875 --> 01:01:33,666
Good or bad.

907
01:01:36,083 --> 01:01:37,041
I say..

908
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:43,625
..the circumstances
that Punjab is in..

909
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:46,375
..we need to have
a CM who is like you.

910
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,625
What happened?

911
01:01:52,833 --> 01:01:53,750
You didn't go.

912
01:01:53,875 --> 01:01:56,083
Be brave. Get up.
Go and talk to him.

913
01:01:57,125 --> 01:01:58,208
- Dimpy.
- Yes?

914
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,625
Why should I
always take the lead?

915
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,125
He is your friend as well.

916
01:02:02,416 --> 01:02:03,500
You go and talk to him.

917
01:02:04,291 --> 01:02:05,250
You too have a right over him.

918
01:02:05,375 --> 01:02:06,375
- Really?
- Yeah.

919
01:02:06,583 --> 01:02:09,375
I didn't ask you for my right
that you are giving it to me in a bag.

920
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,000
I am giving it to you
from my heart, take it.

921
01:02:11,166 --> 01:02:14,500
MLA sir, please save me.
For God's sake, save me.

922
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:15,583
Who is he?

923
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:16,750
Catch him.

924
01:02:16,875 --> 01:02:19,000
Save me, sir.

925
01:02:19,083 --> 01:02:20,375
Sir, they disconnected..

926
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:23,000
- ..the power of my pumping station.
- What happened to you?

927
01:02:23,416 --> 01:02:25,833
My harvest will get ruined.
My family will get ruined, sir.

928
01:02:25,916 --> 01:02:26,500
Please listen to me, sir.

929
01:02:26,583 --> 01:02:28,250
Dimpy, why is he
addressing me as MLA?

930
01:02:28,708 --> 01:02:31,916
Anyone who listens to
a poor man is MLA for him.

931
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
- Come with me.
- We will talk.

932
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:37,041
Come with me.
We will discuss it.

933
01:02:37,125 --> 01:02:38,833
Your job will be done.

934
01:02:39,125 --> 01:02:42,375
They are villagers.
They are naive. It's nothing.

935
01:02:42,833 --> 01:02:45,500
Why were you going after the MLA?

936
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:50,625
Son, if the MLA of our
area won't help us then who will?

937
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,000
Who told you that he won't help you?

938
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:53,750
He will.

939
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:57,875
But he is feeling bad
that you are begging to him.

940
01:02:57,958 --> 01:02:59,625
- Ok.
- Right.

941
01:03:00,458 --> 01:03:02,625
He serves everyone from his heart.

942
01:03:02,833 --> 01:03:04,250
He thinks it is his duty.

943
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:07,208
- You don't need to beg, plead.
- Amazing.

944
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,875
It is a nice way to
pacify the elders.

945
01:03:10,958 --> 01:03:11,916
What is it, Mr. Wrestler?

946
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,333
Did a weak wrestler defeat you
that you are venting your anger on us?

947
01:03:15,916 --> 01:03:19,583
Uncle, why are you begging to him?

948
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:24,083
Leaders need us only
when they want our votes.

949
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:26,000
They have nothing
to do with us otherwise.

950
01:03:26,083 --> 01:03:28,500
How will they understand
our sorrows?

951
01:03:29,166 --> 01:03:30,125
He is absolutely right.

952
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:34,250
Till a common man who casts his
vote doesn't understand his power..

953
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:36,000
..this is what will
continue to happen.

954
01:03:37,083 --> 01:03:40,500
Tell me, why did that J.E.
disconnect the power supply?

955
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:41,750
I..

956
01:03:41,875 --> 01:03:45,375
Goats make that noise.
You should talk like a lion.

957
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,750
Come with me.
I will go and check.

958
01:03:47,833 --> 01:03:49,375
Don't address him as MLA,
he will get angry.

959
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:53,833
He is going to some get into some
new mess now? - Let's go.

960
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:59,500
Son, he is eyeing
my young daughter.

961
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:01,958
He has even troubled her
while she was going to college.

962
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:04,875
When I objected,
he came to trouble me like this.

963
01:04:04,958 --> 01:04:07,375
He made a false case and
disconnected the power supply.

964
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:10,000
Where is that old man taking him?

965
01:04:10,666 --> 01:04:12,125
Move out of the way.

966
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:14,208
I have to go to get the fodder.
Where are you guys going?

967
01:04:14,291 --> 01:04:15,750
Our car is parked there.
You can take that.

968
01:04:15,833 --> 01:04:19,125
Be careful with it.
I have taken good care of it.

969
01:04:19,333 --> 01:04:23,500
Sir, there is no power supply
but look at the bill amount.

970
01:04:24,875 --> 01:04:26,458
It is our job to send the bill.

971
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:27,791
We sent it on time.

972
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,875
If there is no power supply
then go and talk to the government.

973
01:04:29,958 --> 01:04:31,125
Why have you come here?

974
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:35,000
Sir, for poor people like us,
you guys are the government.

975
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:37,083
You have to solve our problem.

976
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:39,833
Tell me, how can I get
such an exorbitant bill amount?

977
01:04:40,208 --> 01:04:41,083
Listen..

978
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,833
Do you see that boy
standing in the queue?

979
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:46,000
- The one with Yanky hat?
- Yes.

980
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,875
He doesn't even have
a meter at home.

981
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:48,916
Yet he got a bill.

982
01:04:49,166 --> 01:04:50,500
And you are crying
over no power supply.

983
01:04:50,625 --> 01:04:51,708
Go and pay the bill.

984
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:53,208
Otherwise, we will
disconnect your meter.

985
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:55,125
What else do you know other
than disconnecting the meter?

986
01:04:55,291 --> 01:04:56,833
Sir, you?

987
01:04:57,125 --> 01:04:59,250
Stop blabbering and answer me.

988
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,208
Why do you disconnect the meters?

989
01:05:01,583 --> 01:05:03,250
Sir, because they don't pay the bill.

990
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:05,875
And this gentleman,
he pays his bills on time.

991
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:07,125
Why did you disconnect his bill?

992
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:11,583
His meter!
Sir, I.. I will find out right away.

993
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:12,958
You know everything.

994
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:15,333
Before everyone standing
outside finds out..

995
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,875
..you better mend your mistake.

996
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:21,916
You don't know how easily
you can lose your position J.E.

997
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,375
You are mistaken, sir.

998
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:25,916
Please have a seat.

999
01:05:26,375 --> 01:05:28,000
Why is he giving me his seat?

1000
01:05:28,250 --> 01:05:31,583
Because of his deeds, he
doesn't deserve to sit on that seat.

1001
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:33,750
That's why he is
offering you his seat.

1002
01:05:34,416 --> 01:05:39,250
A poor man's sigh makes
less noise but it hurts the heart.

1003
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:41,583
In the high of your
position don't forget that..

1004
01:05:41,666 --> 01:05:43,125
..the government has
given you this position.

1005
01:05:43,208 --> 01:05:45,083
And the government
is made by the common man.

1006
01:05:45,583 --> 01:05:49,375
Take the officer's salary
and behave like a public servant.

1007
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:51,958
- Do you understand.
- Yes, I understood.

1008
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:54,125
Now tell me, when will
his motor start running?

1009
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,916
Your power supply will be restored
before you reach home, uncle.

1010
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,750
Mind it.

1011
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:00,250
Ok? Let's go, brother.

1012
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:01,958
Sir, would you like
some tea or cold drink?

1013
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,750
If would be better
if you give him results.

1014
01:06:07,250 --> 01:06:11,500
Your father would have
been very proud of you.

1015
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:13,208
God bless you.

1016
01:06:14,583 --> 01:06:18,083
Master, he isn't like
we assumed him to be.

1017
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:22,250
Thank you very much, son.
God bless you.

1018
01:06:24,583 --> 01:06:26,250
So, this is done.

1019
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:29,750
The one whose job we
had come here to do has left.

1020
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:33,375
He doesn't even remember
that he has to take you back.

1021
01:06:34,166 --> 01:06:37,416
- Right?
- What are friends for?

1022
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:40,041
Really? So you will ride
your friend's scooter today?

1023
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,708
Come on then,
my tempo is ready to leave.

1024
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:46,250
Dimpy, I don't understand.

1025
01:06:46,625 --> 01:06:48,958
Why are people giving
me so much respect?

1026
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:50,625
Why are they
addressing me as "Sir"?

1027
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:56,375
Well, I think you look like
a very famous Punjabi singer.

1028
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:59,250
I look like a Punjabi singer?
Which one?

1029
01:06:59,375 --> 01:07:01,250
- Gursevak Mann.
- Really?

1030
01:07:01,625 --> 01:07:03,875
I got lucky today.

1031
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:07,916
I have fun in my Ford Tractor!

1032
01:07:08,916 --> 01:07:11,125
Oh damn you, uncle!

1033
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:13,208
He turned the car into a cart.

1034
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:14,375
So much fodder?

1035
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:18,500
As I had a car I thought
I should take a few day's supply.

1036
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:23,625
You got your supply but it will
take us a week to get the car cleaned.

1037
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:25,750
You turned 24 lakhs
worth vehicle into a cart.

1038
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,208
Listen, first both of you tell me..

1039
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:31,500
..whose car is it
and how did you get it?

1040
01:07:32,125 --> 01:07:33,375
I too asked him.

1041
01:07:33,625 --> 01:07:35,875
He said I will tell
you when the time is right.

1042
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,000
Tell us then, it's time.

1043
01:07:38,875 --> 01:07:42,625
This car belongs to a big company.

1044
01:07:42,708 --> 01:07:45,083
And it came from here,
as the road is wider.

1045
01:07:45,166 --> 01:07:46,375
Stop your nonsense.

1046
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:49,000
Actually, someone
owned me some money.

1047
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:51,125
He wasn't repaying.
So I took his car's keys.

1048
01:07:51,208 --> 01:07:52,625
I told him to give me the
money and take the car back.

1049
01:07:52,708 --> 01:07:53,916
It is not a big deal.

1050
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:56,916
Buta's job got easier
because of this car.

1051
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,125
Look how happy he is.

1052
01:08:01,833 --> 01:08:04,750
How someone's happiness
can make you happy..

1053
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,958
I learnt that today.

1054
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:11,750
Today, when I helped that
elderly in getting his job done..

1055
01:08:12,291 --> 01:08:16,250
..at the electricity office I realized
why father used to help others.

1056
01:08:46,166 --> 01:08:50,416
<i>"You too might need</i>
<i>his help some day.."</i>

1057
01:08:50,541 --> 01:08:52,333
Yudhveer.

1058
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:53,916
<i>"The soil.."</i>

1059
01:08:54,041 --> 01:08:55,583
Stop stealing
kites from the terrace.

1060
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:57,625
Come down and see
who has come to meet you.

1061
01:08:58,083 --> 01:08:59,500
Where is he coming from?

1062
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:03,958
- Hello.
- Hello.

1063
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:05,666
Who are you?

1064
01:09:05,750 --> 01:09:07,083
I am Manvi.

1065
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:09,708
Manvi.

1066
01:09:10,791 --> 01:09:11,833
Why have you come here?

1067
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:15,083
- I have come to meet you.
- Don't get too frank.

1068
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:18,166
- Me?
- Well..

1069
01:09:22,333 --> 01:09:23,958
What work do you have with me?

1070
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:27,708
She runs an institute.

1071
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:31,125
- Her institute needs your help.
- Yes. That's right.

1072
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:35,333
But how can I help your institute?

1073
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,416
Are we going to continue
talking against the wind..

1074
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,333
..or can we talk
face to face as well?

1075
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:41,958
Ok, come upstairs.
Come from there.

1076
01:09:42,041 --> 01:09:44,208
- Ok, we will go upstairs.
- Let's go.

1077
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:47,583
Manvi, remember one thing.
You don't know him. Ok?

1078
01:09:47,833 --> 01:09:49,125
This is the first time
you are meeting him.

1079
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:49,958
Sure.

1080
01:09:51,291 --> 01:09:55,125
- Manvi, you are unknown to him.
- Ok.

1081
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:56,958
Hello.

1082
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,666
Please sit.

1083
01:09:58,875 --> 01:09:59,541
Hello.

1084
01:09:59,625 --> 01:10:00,958
- Please sit.
- Yes.

1085
01:10:01,083 --> 01:10:02,416
You sit over there, next to Veer.

1086
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,791
Not there.

1087
01:10:03,875 --> 01:10:06,083
Are you getting them engaged
that you are making them sit together?

1088
01:10:06,166 --> 01:10:07,541
Sit over here, please.

1089
01:10:07,958 --> 01:10:08,541
Yes.

1090
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:10,458
No, you should sit there.

1091
01:10:10,541 --> 01:10:12,041
- Oh no.
- What are you doing?

1092
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:13,041
You sit here.

1093
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,916
I will sit with him.
It's not a problem.

1094
01:10:18,416 --> 01:10:20,166
So tell me,
what brings you here?

1095
01:10:21,666 --> 01:10:24,083
I am here to help the poor.

1096
01:10:25,333 --> 01:10:27,875
Good. But we aren't that poor.

1097
01:10:28,208 --> 01:10:31,833
No, I mean I have come
here to seek help for the poor.

1098
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:34,583
Ok.

1099
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:40,708
I think she means that her institute
helps the poor and the needy.

1100
01:10:40,791 --> 01:10:42,708
Hence, she has come here
to seek some financial help.

1101
01:10:42,833 --> 01:10:45,083
- Right.
- The way we helped that elderly.

1102
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,666
- Yes, yes.
- Yes.

1103
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:50,916
Dimpy, don't you think
you know a lot about her?

1104
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,583
- Just guessing.
- Yes.

1105
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,833
Guessing.

1106
01:10:56,083 --> 01:11:00,666
Next time send those
who need the help.

1107
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:01,791
You don't need to come here.

1108
01:11:01,916 --> 01:11:03,416
- They are also here.
- Damn you!

1109
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:04,833
- Where are they?
- Outside.

1110
01:11:05,166 --> 01:11:05,875
Outside?

1111
01:11:06,916 --> 01:11:07,666
Outside?

1112
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:09,833
Where did they go?

1113
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,916
Do you understand what you
have to say once you go inside?

1114
01:11:12,041 --> 01:11:12,625
- Ok?
- Yes.

1115
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:13,958
Tell me how will you talk?

1116
01:11:14,458 --> 01:11:16,833
MLA sir, we are very poor.

1117
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:19,083
That can be known
from your face itself.

1118
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:22,000
How many times have I told
you not to address him as MLA?

1119
01:11:22,083 --> 01:11:22,916
But why?

1120
01:11:23,083 --> 01:11:26,083
Our MLA is close to his roots.

1121
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:28,125
He serves from his heart.

1122
01:11:28,416 --> 01:11:30,333
He doesn't like anyone
begging or pleading him.

1123
01:11:30,458 --> 01:11:31,666
Why don't you understand this?

1124
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:34,208
Well done.
Come on, give me a hug.

1125
01:11:34,458 --> 01:11:35,041
Very good.

1126
01:11:35,291 --> 01:11:36,541
Did all of you hear him?

1127
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:37,333
- You have to follow him
 - Ok.

1128
01:11:37,416 --> 01:11:39,916
Talk like he does.
Tell everyone how you will talk.

1129
01:11:40,583 --> 01:11:44,083
- MLA sir..
- Damn you! Back to square one.

1130
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,583
You don't have to
address him as MLA.

1131
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:48,791
He is about to become the CM.
It is not right to address him as MLA.

1132
01:11:48,958 --> 01:11:50,416
Then we will address him as CM.

1133
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,708
No, he is not the CM as yet.

1134
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,208
Hence, you cannot
even address him as CM.

1135
01:11:54,291 --> 01:11:56,958
- No CM, no MLA. Ok?
- Ok, brother.

1136
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:59,291
Everyone address him as "Mister".

1137
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:01,333
- Sir?
- Yes, address him as "Sir".

1138
01:12:01,541 --> 01:12:04,541
Brother, you can
address him as anything.

1139
01:12:04,625 --> 01:12:06,083
Just don't address him as MLA or CM.

1140
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:07,416
Yes. Got it?

1141
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,458
Ok.

1142
01:12:09,083 --> 01:12:11,041
- Hello.
- Hello.

1143
01:12:12,291 --> 01:12:13,958
- Hello, brother.
- Hello.

1144
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:15,916
- Hello, brother.
- Hello.

1145
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:17,083
What problem are you facing?

1146
01:12:17,166 --> 01:12:19,083
Brother, the police
have seized my truck.

1147
01:12:19,208 --> 01:12:20,958
Illegally, without any
fault of mine.

1148
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:21,833
Ok.

1149
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,166
- You?
- The depot person troubles us.

1150
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:26,208
Even when the stock comes,
he says that it's not there.

1151
01:12:26,291 --> 01:12:27,916
If he gives anything
then he under weighs it.

1152
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,833
And he blacks the rest of the stock.

1153
01:12:30,083 --> 01:12:30,916
- Ok, I will look into it.
- Yes.

1154
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,166
Yes, what is your problem?

1155
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:34,666
Brother, Lambar's daughter
used to eye me.

1156
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,458
So I went and proposed her.

1157
01:12:36,666 --> 01:12:38,041
She went to the police and
registered a complaint against me.

1158
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:40,791
She told them that I trouble her.
Tell me, what should I do?

1159
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:42,666
Inder, help him.

1160
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:46,208
You come with me. I will
give you the permit to love.

1161
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:49,208
Yes, ma'am.
What is your problem?

1162
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:52,875
Son, I go to the bank
to withdraw my pension.

1163
01:12:53,208 --> 01:12:56,041
- The manager doesn't listen to me.
- Ok.

1164
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:59,416
He always keeps asking
for some or the other document.

1165
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:01,208
- So I..
- It's ok, ma'am.

1166
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,291
I come back troubled.

1167
01:13:02,375 --> 01:13:04,333
- You won't be troubled.
- Ok.

1168
01:13:04,416 --> 01:13:06,333
I will talk to the manager.
Come with me.

1169
01:13:08,875 --> 01:13:13,791
<i>"The blood shows it true color,</i>
<i>you can see the difference."</i>

1170
01:13:14,208 --> 01:13:18,958
<i>"He gets the job done in minutes,</i>
<i>this is how he is."</i>

1171
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:24,166
<i>"Today the water of Punjab</i>
<i>is showing its effect."</i>

1172
01:13:24,666 --> 01:13:29,458
<i>"He is getting to know himself</i>
<i>and his ancestors better."</i>

1173
01:13:29,791 --> 01:13:34,666
<i>"He does ditto of what he says."</i>

1174
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:39,333
<i>"He does ditto of what</i>
<i>he says. He is strong hearted."</i>

1175
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:43,083
<i>"Our CM remembers everything."</i>

1176
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:48,375
<i>"Our CM will change</i>
<i>the whole of Punjab."</i>

1177
01:13:55,083 --> 01:13:58,083
Venting your anger on the
newspaper won't help, Daman.

1178
01:13:58,583 --> 01:14:01,291
He left everything
and went to the village.

1179
01:14:01,833 --> 01:14:04,333
And he is loved
even more by the people.

1180
01:14:08,333 --> 01:14:13,333
Not in politics,
he should be in movies.

1181
01:14:13,958 --> 01:14:16,083
New tricks every day.

1182
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:19,875
He thinks of a new way every day.

1183
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Whatever, he is bound
to ruin your scene.

1184
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:31,000
If this continues, then even
if I announce your name as the CM..

1185
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:33,875
..but people will
not accept this decision.

1186
01:14:34,041 --> 01:14:40,000
No one other than Damanjeet
Singh can become the CM.

1187
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:46,833
Yudhveer likes to make the headlines,
doesn't he?

1188
01:14:48,625 --> 01:14:52,125
Tomorrow there will be
a new Headline.

1189
01:14:52,458 --> 01:14:54,250
With his name on it.

1190
01:14:56,333 --> 01:14:57,875
Very good.

1191
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:18,583
Yudhveer, it's your success.

1192
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:21,875
I mean the way you are succeeding..

1193
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:23,708
..you should become a leader now.

1194
01:15:23,958 --> 01:15:24,791
What do you say?

1195
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,083
Inder, stop the car.

1196
01:15:27,666 --> 01:15:30,208
No, brother.
Don't get angry. I am sorry.

1197
01:15:30,333 --> 01:15:31,458
Stop the car.

1198
01:15:31,541 --> 01:15:33,666
I am sorry. Don't get down.
I am sorry.

1199
01:15:33,916 --> 01:15:35,791
Don't insult me in front of the girl.

1200
01:15:36,333 --> 01:15:38,333
I am thirsty.
I want to drink water.

1201
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:39,958
Would you like to
drink anything?

1202
01:15:40,041 --> 01:15:40,750
No, thanks.

1203
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:41,750
Stop the car.

1204
01:15:41,833 --> 01:15:43,125
Stop at that restaurant.

1205
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,541
Go with him.

1206
01:15:56,625 --> 01:15:58,791
- Let him go alone.
- Go with him.

1207
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:03,583
A bottle of water, please.

1208
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:05,958
Why just one, take two.

1209
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:07,791
- No, one is enough.
- Here you go.

1210
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:09,083
Money?

1211
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:11,083
We pay it to the police.

1212
01:16:11,208 --> 01:16:12,208
Every month.

1213
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:15,833
Whether or not they pass it forward,
it is their responsibility.

1214
01:16:16,458 --> 01:16:18,666
If you say, I will
give it to you henceforth.

1215
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:20,000
What is he blabbering?

1216
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:23,000
He is talking nonsense.
He is high on drugs.

1217
01:16:23,083 --> 01:16:24,458
Go, I will pay him and come.

1218
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:26,458
- Get a newspaper.
- Yes, I will get it.

1219
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,958
What was that nonsense?
Don't you have any shame?

1220
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:29,916
How much does he owe you?

1221
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:31,041
20 rupees.

1222
01:16:31,541 --> 01:16:33,041
Give a newspaper as well.

1223
01:16:33,166 --> 01:16:34,833
Give me 5 rupees change.

1224
01:16:35,458 --> 01:16:37,458
If I don't have 5 rupees change,
can I give a torn tenner?

1225
01:16:37,666 --> 01:16:38,833
Stop your nonsense.

1226
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:39,958
You tongue needs..

1227
01:16:42,916 --> 01:16:45,291
How many such newspapers
do you have?

1228
01:16:47,833 --> 01:16:48,708
Around 50-60.

1229
01:16:48,833 --> 01:16:49,583
Give me all of them.

1230
01:16:50,583 --> 01:16:53,333
If I give all of them to you, what
will I sell for the rest of the day?

1231
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:55,041
You are squirming
as if I a snake bit you.

1232
01:16:55,125 --> 01:16:57,541
- I will pay you.
- No.

1233
01:16:57,791 --> 01:16:58,666
I will buy them.

1234
01:16:58,750 --> 01:16:59,916
I don't want to sell
all of them to you.

1235
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:01,083
Keep this with you as well.

1236
01:17:01,333 --> 01:17:02,666
I will keep it.

1237
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,958
I wonder where
such people come from.

1238
01:17:07,958 --> 01:17:09,708
Dimpy, I had asked
you to get a newspaper.

1239
01:17:10,916 --> 01:17:12,833
Those were all old newspapers.

1240
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:13,958
Drive.

1241
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:20,583
Leave.

1242
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:23,708
Do you see my stick?
We are not having a fair over here.

1243
01:17:26,958 --> 01:17:27,791
Let's go, brother.

1244
01:17:29,458 --> 01:17:30,458
What happened?

1245
01:17:32,041 --> 01:17:33,958
His photo has made
it to the headlines.

1246
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:35,833
What are you saying?

1247
01:17:36,041 --> 01:17:37,833
We are trying to keep him hidden.

1248
01:17:37,916 --> 01:17:40,875
We follow him like his shadow
so that he doesn't find out the truth.

1249
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:43,458
Now the newspaper has printed
his photo on the front page.

1250
01:17:45,833 --> 01:17:47,041
These kids..

1251
01:17:48,291 --> 01:17:50,166
Look what they have
done to today's newspaper.

1252
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,208
MLA became people's hero.

1253
01:17:59,666 --> 01:18:01,708
He went on streets
to help the people.

1254
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:05,083
- Inder..
- What?

1255
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:07,041
Who is the MLA of our area?

1256
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:09,041
- Our..
- Our..

1257
01:18:09,625 --> 01:18:10,708
MLA..

1258
01:18:11,125 --> 01:18:12,333
He..

1259
01:18:14,416 --> 01:18:15,791
His photo is printed
in the newspaper.

1260
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:16,875
His photo? Show it to me.

1261
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:26,083
Kids have done a good job.

1262
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,333
Kids..

1263
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:29,666
They say kids are a form of God.

1264
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,250
You know.

1265
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:34,833
- God saved us today.
- He surely did!

1266
01:18:39,708 --> 01:18:41,041
- So?
- So..

1267
01:18:43,208 --> 01:18:44,083
Hello.

1268
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:45,750
Did the old woman
get her pension?

1269
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,416
- Yes.
- That's good.

1270
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:51,541
- So?
- Everything is fine.

1271
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:54,000
Ok.

1272
01:18:55,166 --> 01:18:55,875
Work?

1273
01:18:56,625 --> 01:18:59,125
You know everything about the work.
I have seeded rice.

1274
01:18:59,333 --> 01:19:01,541
At night when we get power supply,
I start the water.

1275
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:02,958
Ok.

1276
01:19:04,541 --> 01:19:06,875
- Did you give the fodder to the cattle?
- I did that early in the morning.

1277
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:09,416
Ok.

1278
01:19:10,166 --> 01:19:12,250
So you have no work left?

1279
01:19:12,458 --> 01:19:15,416
Work? Son, I am
no officer anywhere.

1280
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:19,541
Tea?

1281
01:19:19,708 --> 01:19:21,208
I had it in the morning.

1282
01:19:21,666 --> 01:19:22,666
Oh.

1283
01:19:25,916 --> 01:19:30,708
Then do one thing, make one cup..
make two cups of tea for us.

1284
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:32,791
From when did you start drinking tea?

1285
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:37,333
Well, I feel like drinking it today.

1286
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:41,416
Wait for another ten minutes.

1287
01:19:41,500 --> 01:19:43,916
I will milk the buffalo
and make tea with fresh milk.

1288
01:19:44,666 --> 01:19:46,166
Forget about the fresh milk.

1289
01:19:46,791 --> 01:19:48,041
Make black tea for both of us.

1290
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:50,625
I don't know how to make black tea.

1291
01:19:52,625 --> 01:19:53,875
Then go and get a
glass of water for me.

1292
01:19:53,958 --> 01:19:55,750
The pot is kept next
to you with the glass.

1293
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:57,291
You can drink as
much water as you want.

1294
01:19:57,541 --> 01:19:58,416
Go away from here.

1295
01:19:58,833 --> 01:19:59,541
Go.

1296
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:00,916
- What?
- Go and milk the buffalo.

1297
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,375
Make tea for us. Don't show
me your face for another half an hour.

1298
01:20:03,458 --> 01:20:05,125
- Half an hour?
- Go. Leave.

1299
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:08,125
That's strange.

1300
01:20:08,625 --> 01:20:09,833
Half an hour for what?

1301
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:11,250
Sorry.

1302
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:14,625
Ok then, I will get going.

1303
01:20:15,875 --> 01:20:16,875
Really?

1304
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:20,000
- It is necessary?
- Yes.

1305
01:20:20,458 --> 01:20:23,208
Ok then, come,
I will drop you.

1306
01:20:25,375 --> 01:20:26,833
You didn't even have the tea.

1307
01:20:26,958 --> 01:20:28,375
Was all the work done properly?

1308
01:20:28,458 --> 01:20:29,875
I hope I didn't miss anything.

1309
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:33,125
No. I think I troubled you a lot.

1310
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:35,375
Helping a dear one
is never troublesome.

1311
01:20:35,541 --> 01:20:36,291
What?

1312
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,625
Well, I mean, we know each other.

1313
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:42,083
We are friends.

1314
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:43,625
It is a good deed.

1315
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:49,625
Let me know if I
can ever help you again.

1316
01:20:49,875 --> 01:20:51,083
Give me your number.

1317
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:54,166
You can't give me your number?

1318
01:20:54,958 --> 01:20:56,625
Yes, of course I can. Why not?

1319
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:00,208
Brother, can you give me a pen please?

1320
01:21:01,083 --> 01:21:01,833
Yes, I have a pen.

1321
01:21:03,791 --> 01:21:04,708
Here.

1322
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:07,833
- Here you go.
- Paper?

1323
01:21:08,250 --> 01:21:09,708
You can write on my hand.

1324
01:21:13,375 --> 01:21:14,250
There you go.

1325
01:21:14,333 --> 01:21:15,250
Thank you.

1326
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:17,541
- Ok.
- Ok.

1327
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:18,958
- Bye.
- Bye.

1328
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:31,666
<i>"Oh my beloved.."</i>

1329
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:36,041
<i>.."let me reside</i>
<i>you in my eyes."</i>

1330
01:21:36,125 --> 01:21:37,166
Uncle!

1331
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:40,125
Stop it. Let me help you.

1332
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:42,416
- I will manage it.
- Let me help you.

1333
01:21:42,666 --> 01:21:43,541
Right here?

1334
01:21:44,458 --> 01:21:46,583
There. It's done.

1335
01:21:47,083 --> 01:21:49,958
- Here you go.
- God bless you.

1336
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:33,333
Get him!

1337
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:47,791
Let's leave!

1338
01:22:53,916 --> 01:22:55,416
Quick! Run!

1339
01:23:18,208 --> 01:23:19,875
Uncle Bawa!

1340
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:22,666
Uncle Bawa!

1341
01:23:22,791 --> 01:23:24,416
Some men are
attacking uncle Yudhveer.

1342
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:25,666
Let's go, boys.

1343
01:23:26,333 --> 01:23:27,250
Let's go!

1344
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:28,583
To the fields!

1345
01:23:52,875 --> 01:23:54,375
Yudhveer!

1346
01:23:54,708 --> 01:23:56,958
Run home!

1347
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:00,666
I am here!

1348
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,791
I am here!

1349
01:24:11,416 --> 01:24:14,041
Let me show you
what I can do!

1350
01:24:26,708 --> 01:24:29,125
You damn chicken-chilly!

1351
01:24:30,125 --> 01:24:32,916
You couldn't get
rid of an ordinary man?

1352
01:24:33,208 --> 01:24:34,833
Brother, he is no ordinary man.

1353
01:24:35,375 --> 01:24:36,875
He has many bodybuilders
working with him.

1354
01:24:37,083 --> 01:24:40,291
Not just us, no one would
dare to hurt him in that village.

1355
01:24:41,375 --> 01:24:45,708
Those who ride camels don't
need to be scared of dogs.

1356
01:24:51,708 --> 01:24:54,291
We will need to find
a permanent solution for him.

1357
01:24:54,458 --> 01:24:58,333
Brother, please look over here.

1358
01:25:06,916 --> 01:25:08,458
Who were they?

1359
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,750
I don't have any land
dispute with anyone.

1360
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:12,458
I don't know
why they came after me.

1361
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:14,166
I don't know who they were.

1362
01:25:14,291 --> 01:25:15,958
But if I could get hold of them then..

1363
01:25:16,125 --> 01:25:17,750
..I'd teach them
a lesson one by one.

1364
01:25:18,041 --> 01:25:20,125
How dare they touch you?

1365
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:21,458
Forget it, Buta.

1366
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:23,625
God bless you.

1367
01:25:42,958 --> 01:25:45,333
Sir, even after being thrashed
black and blue he hasn't said a word.

1368
01:25:56,666 --> 01:25:59,083
He is very stubborn.

1369
01:26:06,833 --> 01:26:10,583
People don't fear death..

1370
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,791
..as much as Daman's mere mention.

1371
01:26:57,041 --> 01:27:00,333
This dog Daman manages to
come up with a new way every day.

1372
01:27:00,958 --> 01:27:04,083
We were trying our best
to make our friend the CM.

1373
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:08,125
But now the fear of police
causing trouble is haunting us.

1374
01:27:09,125 --> 01:27:10,583
I know Billa quite well.

1375
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:14,291
His promise is
as good as his aim.

1376
01:27:15,666 --> 01:27:18,041
But how did they manage
to get their hands on him?

1377
01:27:18,208 --> 01:27:19,666
Forget about how
they got hold of him.

1378
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:21,541
Now think of a way
to get him out of there.

1379
01:27:29,625 --> 01:27:31,666
Veer!

1380
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:34,083
Wake up. It's morning.

1381
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,958
Wake up. It's morning.

1382
01:27:45,583 --> 01:27:46,666
We will get thrashed.

1383
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:48,708
God, please help us.

1384
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:51,208
Oh God!

1385
01:27:51,291 --> 01:27:52,291
It's Mr. Gill.

1386
01:27:52,708 --> 01:27:54,958
We keep facing a
new trouble every day.

1387
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:56,500
- What do we tell him?
- Answer it.

1388
01:27:56,583 --> 01:27:57,625
- What will I tell him?
- I said, answer it.

1389
01:27:57,708 --> 01:27:59,750
- But what will I say to him?
- We will talk to him.

1390
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:01,375
Hello? Hi.

1391
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:03,041
Yes.

1392
01:28:03,458 --> 01:28:06,250
Don't worry. I will be there soon.
I will come and meet you.

1393
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:08,291
- Yes.
- That's not Dimpy's voice.

1394
01:28:08,708 --> 01:28:09,916
Something's fishy.

1395
01:28:10,083 --> 01:28:11,458
- Is the jeep ready?
- Yes!

1396
01:28:11,625 --> 01:28:12,208
Let's go.

1397
01:28:19,625 --> 01:28:20,791
Manvi?

1398
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:22,291
Papa?

1399
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:24,500
You got up quite early today.

1400
01:28:25,583 --> 01:28:29,333
Dear, I have been getting up
early since the past 30 years.

1401
01:28:29,875 --> 01:28:33,708
What is the reason you are
getting up so early these days?

1402
01:28:33,875 --> 01:28:35,916
May I ask where are you going?

1403
01:28:36,791 --> 01:28:39,000
Well, Papa..

1404
01:28:39,625 --> 01:28:42,583
Why? You are finding
it difficult to lie?

1405
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:46,541
Dear, your silence
is telling me the truth.

1406
01:28:47,541 --> 01:28:48,708
Just keep one thing in mind.

1407
01:28:50,125 --> 01:28:52,750
I spent my life
building my reputation.

1408
01:28:53,583 --> 01:28:55,583
And now my honor
is in your hand.

1409
01:28:55,666 --> 01:28:57,208
What are you saying?

1410
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,791
Yudhveer is not like that.
He respects you.

1411
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,500
There is no good
or bad in politics.

1412
01:29:05,833 --> 01:29:07,666
There are just friends
and opposition.

1413
01:29:08,208 --> 01:29:09,541
And he belongs to
the opposition party.

1414
01:29:10,208 --> 01:29:14,583
Hence, it would be better
if you don't meet him.

1415
01:29:15,208 --> 01:29:17,291
But I love him.

1416
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:19,958
And I love you.
Hence, I am telling you that.

1417
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,875
The coalition that
you are trying to form..

1418
01:29:23,875 --> 01:29:25,708
..it's not possible in politics.

1419
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:30,833
You always say that you should
keep family and politics separate.

1420
01:29:31,375 --> 01:29:33,875
Now you are involving
politics in your family life.

1421
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:38,666
You are my daughter hence
you make such good arguments.

1422
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:40,875
Keep one thing in mind.

1423
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,291
What you are trying to do..

1424
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:48,291
..is impossible.

1425
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,125
Papa, please. Papa!

1426
01:29:57,125 --> 01:29:58,166
Oh no.

1427
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:00,833
Ever seen Animal Planet?

1428
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:02,083
Yes, why?

1429
01:30:02,541 --> 01:30:05,041
Can two lions fight 40 hippos?

1430
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:09,583
Even if the lions get beaten up,
they will have to fight.

1431
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:11,666
- Really? Let's go.
- Wait.

1432
01:30:12,958 --> 01:30:17,333
We will enter like the
movie Sholay's Jai and Veeru.

1433
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:18,333
Is it?

1434
01:31:03,583 --> 01:31:06,000
<i>"If you have such good friends.."</i>

1435
01:31:06,083 --> 01:31:10,708
<i>"If you have such good friends..</i>
<i>Then life is beautiful."</i>

1436
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:13,250
<i>"Then life is beautiful."</i>

1437
01:31:35,541 --> 01:31:36,500
Where did he go?

1438
01:31:48,208 --> 01:31:49,166
There he is!

1439
01:31:57,083 --> 01:31:58,333
Now where is he?

1440
01:32:15,083 --> 01:32:16,250
That feels so good!

1441
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:26,416
I'll teach them a lesson!

1442
01:33:50,666 --> 01:33:53,875
Idiots, sometimes those dogs
come here to beat you guys up..

1443
01:33:54,125 --> 01:33:56,041
..and sometimes you go to their place.

1444
01:33:56,625 --> 01:33:57,666
What is this all about?

1445
01:34:01,541 --> 01:34:02,875
Why are you shaking your head?

1446
01:34:03,666 --> 01:34:06,541
We wouldn't have told
any stranger about this.

1447
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:09,875
But you have saved
our friend's life.

1448
01:34:10,791 --> 01:34:12,041
Our too.

1449
01:34:12,208 --> 01:34:13,500
Tell me what is this all about.

1450
01:34:16,041 --> 01:34:17,125
Actually, the thing is..

1451
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:29,750
A small hole is enough
to sink a big ship, young man.

1452
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:32,958
There are only four days
left for your swearing in ceremony.

1453
01:34:33,833 --> 01:34:35,500
Keep your cool.

1454
01:34:37,541 --> 01:34:39,333
I cannot keep it calm.

1455
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:45,000
Who knows what Yudhveer
will do in these four days.

1456
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:53,375
I play a new game every
day and he ruins it.

1457
01:34:57,916 --> 01:35:03,291
Small games are just
like banging into a wall.

1458
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:10,791
You can take over a few acres
of land with such small tricks.

1459
01:35:11,458 --> 01:35:14,166
But you cannot take over
Punjab's political rein.

1460
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:20,166
Higher the stakes longer the leap.

1461
01:35:22,666 --> 01:35:24,208
The game is in our control.

1462
01:35:25,291 --> 01:35:28,291
If you have any trump
card then use it.

1463
01:35:30,166 --> 01:35:31,750
Here, eat this.

1464
01:35:39,791 --> 01:35:42,208
What are you waiting for? Eat it.

1465
01:35:42,875 --> 01:35:47,083
The food is fine, but what is this?

1466
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:48,750
Buttermilk. Drink it.

1467
01:35:49,208 --> 01:35:51,583
We will give you one
with almonds in the evening.

1468
01:35:51,750 --> 01:35:55,708
Why do you guys want me to fall ill?

1469
01:35:57,333 --> 01:35:58,458
It is very hot out here.

1470
01:35:59,125 --> 01:36:00,625
Get me a beer if you can.

1471
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:02,958
Have you ever been beaten
up on an empty stomach?

1472
01:36:03,208 --> 01:36:05,541
That too without any explanations?

1473
01:36:08,541 --> 01:36:09,625
What do you mean?

1474
01:36:09,708 --> 01:36:13,125
I mean you mentioned
beer in front of us..

1475
01:36:13,208 --> 01:36:14,916
..but don't mention
in front of master.

1476
01:36:15,166 --> 01:36:17,166
Why? Doesn't he drink?

1477
01:36:17,666 --> 01:36:20,666
He doesn't even let anyone
in this village watch its commercials.

1478
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:22,125
And you ask if whether he drinks.

1479
01:36:22,375 --> 01:36:25,125
Here you will get only milk and curd.
Drink it quietly.

1480
01:36:26,583 --> 01:36:27,541
Milk?

1481
01:36:28,833 --> 01:36:32,083
I never even had my mother's milk.

1482
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:34,375
What do you mean?

1483
01:36:35,125 --> 01:36:36,833
She died as soon as I was born.

1484
01:36:38,458 --> 01:36:42,416
And my father was a drunkard.

1485
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,833
He raised me the only way he could.

1486
01:36:48,166 --> 01:36:49,333
It's true.

1487
01:36:50,041 --> 01:36:53,166
He used to put a nipple on the bottle.

1488
01:36:54,875 --> 01:37:00,416
It is a sad story,
but I don't know why I find it funny.

1489
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,875
But you won't be getting
any drugs or alcohol here.

1490
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:04,708
Then I will run away from here.

1491
01:37:04,791 --> 01:37:06,333
If you wish so, sir.

1492
01:37:06,916 --> 01:37:10,083
Anyway, Daman's men
must be looking for you.

1493
01:37:13,666 --> 01:37:18,000
Brother.. I have a request.

1494
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:21,916
You want to feed me milk?

1495
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:23,958
Then get it in a beer's bottle.

1496
01:37:24,416 --> 01:37:27,125
I will at least have the
feeling that I am holding a beer.

1497
01:37:29,291 --> 01:37:30,708
Give him milk.

1498
01:37:31,083 --> 01:37:33,791
"Listen here, oh boy.."

1499
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,375
"Looking at such a beautiful girl.."

1500
01:37:37,458 --> 01:37:40,750
"I feel like falling in love."

1501
01:37:40,833 --> 01:37:43,458
Son, I am going to keep the utensils.
Do you want anything?

1502
01:37:43,875 --> 01:37:45,000
Make me a cup of tea.

1503
01:37:45,083 --> 01:37:45,958
Tea?

1504
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:48,166
- Yes, tea.
- Oh, ok.

1505
01:37:48,416 --> 01:37:49,916
I will take half
an hour to make the tea.

1506
01:37:50,041 --> 01:37:51,458
Ok, I understood.

1507
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,125
"Come here, oh boy. Have a seat."

1508
01:37:57,333 --> 01:38:00,208
"Say whatever you want to say."

1509
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:02,291
"I should know.."

1510
01:38:02,375 --> 01:38:04,375
- Hello. Who is it?
- Hello. Hi!

1511
01:38:04,458 --> 01:38:05,833
It's me, Yudhveer.

1512
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,166
What a pleasant surprise.
So early in the morning?

1513
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:10,833
Yes, just..

1514
01:38:11,416 --> 01:38:12,958
Actually, I wanted to ask..

1515
01:38:13,625 --> 01:38:15,833
..have we really managed
to get rid of poverty from Punjab?

1516
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:17,708
I didn't get you.

1517
01:38:18,083 --> 01:38:22,416
I mean it has been two days since
you brought any poor needy person.

1518
01:38:22,625 --> 01:38:23,958
Ok.

1519

Gurpyaar is the
narrator of this story.

1540
01:41:37,166 --> 01:41:40,583
He is behind this.
Otherwise, that Daman would..

1541

Inder, why is media
coming to our village?

Oh no!

<i>which Gurpyaar's accident took place..</i>

1550
01:42:30,166 --> 01:42:31,833
<i>..was being driven by him.</i>

1551
01:42:32,375 --> 01:42:34,291
It wasn't an accident.

1552
01:42:34,541 --> 01:42:37,291
It was a
well-planned conspiracy.

1553
01:42:37,791 --> 01:42:44,791
I did it for money
at Yudhveer Singh's behest.

1554
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,250
Yudhveer Singh, what do you have to
say about the truck driver Joga Singh?

1555
01:42:47,333 --> 01:42:48,958
I don't know what
you are talking about.

1556
01:42:49,041 --> 01:42:51,125
How did you manage to get
to become CM's post's contender..

1557
01:42:51,208 --> 01:42:53,875
..with just seven years
of political experience?

1558
01:42:58,416 --> 01:43:01,875
Dimpy, Inder. This is
going to cause us big trouble.

1559
01:43:01,958 --> 01:43:03,958
- What happened?
- That truck driver Joga..

1560
01:43:04,041 --> 01:43:06,125
I don't know what
you are talking about.

1561
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:11,083
He's not well.

1562
01:43:16,708 --> 01:43:19,625
The accusations made on
Yudhveer Singh come as a shock.

1563
01:43:19,833 --> 01:43:21,250
His friends have said..

1564
01:43:21,333 --> 01:43:25,416
..that he is being taken to
the hospital because he is unwell.

1565
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:29,250
We just hope that Yudhveer Singh
manages to come out of this unscathed.

1566
01:43:39,333 --> 01:43:41,083
Who is Joga? I didn't do anything.

1567
01:43:41,166 --> 01:43:44,041
<i>Yes, it is true.</i>
<i>I did it at Yudhveer Singh's behest.</i>

1568
01:43:48,291 --> 01:43:50,375
I don't understand anything.
Please stop the car!

1569
01:44:08,500 --> 01:44:09,500
What happened, Yudhveer?

1570
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:12,083
What is happening?

1571
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:19,791
Does the movie 'Ram
And Shyam' ring a bell?

1572
01:44:20,541 --> 01:44:23,458
Two people with the same face.

1573
01:44:23,833 --> 01:44:26,500
You too have a duplicate.

1574
01:44:27,208 --> 01:44:32,541
He has done something wrong and
everyone is mistaking it to be you.

1575
01:44:32,625 --> 01:44:34,750
That's why all the
media and the public--

1576
01:44:35,166 --> 01:44:35,958
- Yudhveer!
- Yudhveer!

1577
01:44:44,458 --> 01:44:45,416
Dimpy?

1578
01:44:46,541 --> 01:44:50,166
We were doing it to
make your dream come true.

1579
01:45:10,083 --> 01:45:14,041
"Yudhveer had a dream
of being the CM."

1580
01:45:14,666 --> 01:45:20,541
"But just one move turned
him into a villain."

1581
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,875
"CM's post contender is.."

1582
01:45:28,333 --> 01:45:33,875
"..being accused of CM's murder."

1583
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:36,666
"Yudhveer Singh."

1584
01:45:37,583 --> 01:45:39,250
Chief..

1585
01:45:40,166 --> 01:45:42,208
I played my trump card.

1586
01:45:43,250 --> 01:45:45,958
If we still don't
win this game..

1587
01:45:47,666 --> 01:45:50,083
..then no one
will call us players.

1588
01:45:51,708 --> 01:45:52,875
Well done.

1589
01:45:53,708 --> 01:45:56,250
I had fun.

1590
01:45:56,916 --> 01:46:02,083
We will have fun when
I will become the CM.

1591
01:46:03,083 --> 01:46:04,541
I don't want to listen
to anything, Manvi.

1592
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:05,625
I don't want to hear anything.

1593
01:46:05,791 --> 01:46:07,375
You will have to, Yudhveer!

1594
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:08,791
Oh really?

1595
01:46:09,166 --> 01:46:10,291
What do you want me to hear?

1596
01:46:10,375 --> 01:46:11,833
Your friends helped you.

1597
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:14,125
If they were right then they
would have told me everything.

1598
01:46:14,208 --> 01:46:15,458
Why didn't they tell me anything?

1599
01:46:15,708 --> 01:46:17,083
Do you know why?

1600
01:46:17,208 --> 01:46:18,750
You have lost your memory.

1601
01:46:19,166 --> 01:46:20,666
I have lost my memory?

1602
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,000
I am telling the truth.

1603
01:46:28,875 --> 01:46:31,250
I don't know who is right or wrong.

1604
01:46:31,333 --> 01:46:35,541
No one can love their friend
as much as these two love you.

1605
01:46:42,458 --> 01:46:43,583
Stop it.

1606
01:46:45,250 --> 01:46:50,083
Once all this is over,
let's go somewhere far away.

1607
01:46:50,583 --> 01:46:53,333
Yes, where there is no one.

1608
01:46:53,666 --> 01:46:55,916
No, we will miss him even more.

1609
01:46:56,416 --> 01:46:58,166
We will go to a place where
there are a lot of people.

1610
01:46:58,250 --> 01:47:00,875
No, we will miss him
even more at such a place.

1611
01:47:04,958 --> 01:47:07,875
And this idiot will
miss his two idiot friends.

1612
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:11,375
Let him miss us.
Why should we care?

1613
01:47:13,333 --> 01:47:14,833
Then take me along.

1614
01:47:15,708 --> 01:47:18,458
How can we take you along.
We are running away from you.

1615
01:47:19,500 --> 01:47:20,541
Then do one thing.

1616
01:47:22,333 --> 01:47:23,541
Forgive me.

1617
01:47:23,791 --> 01:47:26,750
Forgive you? You are very smart.
How can we just forgive you?

1618
01:47:28,125 --> 01:47:29,291
Please forgive me.

1619
01:47:29,541 --> 01:47:30,708
Now should I be at your
feet to ask you to forgive me?

1620
01:47:30,791 --> 01:47:32,291
Or should I beg you
by folding my hands?

1621
01:47:34,166 --> 01:47:35,750
Is the option of
the feet ok with you?

1622
01:47:37,916 --> 01:47:39,083
Naughty!

1623
01:47:53,833 --> 01:47:54,708
Enough.

1624
01:47:57,041 --> 01:47:59,333
- Dimpy?
- Yes.

1625
01:47:59,583 --> 01:48:01,041
I don't remember anything.

1626
01:48:01,541 --> 01:48:03,791
It is possible that
I got the CM killed.

1627
01:48:05,333 --> 01:48:06,125
Yudhveer..

1628
01:48:07,125 --> 01:48:09,833
You have a clever mind
and not a criminal mind.

1629
01:48:11,041 --> 01:48:13,458
You can never do
such a cheap thing.

1630
01:48:15,083 --> 01:48:18,583
Someone who can take the
risk of getting himself shot..

1631
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:21,125
He can go to any extent.

1632
01:48:21,666 --> 01:48:24,333
Yudhveer,
you should trust your friends.

1633
01:48:25,541 --> 01:48:29,583
Brother, the right and the
wrong will be decided in the court.

1634
01:48:30,583 --> 01:48:33,791
For the time being, it is important
that your statement reaches the public.

1635
01:48:33,875 --> 01:48:34,458
That's all.

1636
01:48:34,541 --> 01:48:35,791
- Yes.
- Ok guys, we are ready.

1637
01:48:36,458 --> 01:48:37,708
Come on, let's go.

1638
01:48:38,458 --> 01:48:39,750
Let's do the
important things first.

1639
01:48:39,833 --> 01:48:41,208
All the best.

1640
01:48:42,541 --> 01:48:45,833
"I have come in front of
the camera to tell all of you.."

1641
01:48:45,916 --> 01:48:48,791
"..that all the accusations
made on me are false."

1642
01:48:49,250 --> 01:48:51,666
"And I will present myself
with all the proves."

1643
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:52,916
- Ok?
- Ok.

1644
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:53,583
The message should be clear.

1645
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:54,333
Ready?

1646
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:55,333
Ready.

1647
01:48:57,500 --> 01:49:01,125
I respectfully greet
all the residents of Punjab.

1648
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:02,916
Through the medium of this channel..

1649
01:49:03,541 --> 01:49:06,958
..I want to tell all of
you that I am not hiding anywhere.

1650
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:12,000
I will present myself
in court in police custody.

1651
01:49:12,083 --> 01:49:14,666
Where everything will be cleared out.

1652
01:49:15,166 --> 01:49:15,958
Goodbye.

1653
01:49:16,041 --> 01:49:17,583
What nonsense!
Have you lost your mind?

1654
01:49:17,666 --> 01:49:20,666
Cut the last line.
What do you mean by tomorrow?

1655
01:49:20,750 --> 01:49:22,083
Why did you commit for tomorrow?

1656
01:49:22,250 --> 01:49:25,041
What are you doing?
It is Live. It is On Air.

1657
01:49:25,208 --> 01:49:25,958
It has been telecasted.

1658
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:30,083
Oh shit! - I have given
this a thought before saying it.

1659
01:50:41,666 --> 01:50:43,375
- Yudhveer!
- Yudhveer!

1660
01:50:43,875 --> 01:50:44,833
Yudhveer!

1661
01:50:45,041 --> 01:50:46,333
Where's Yudhveer?

1662
01:51:08,583 --> 01:51:09,875
Daman..

1663
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:15,458
That's a good move.

1664
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:16,625
Very good.

1665
01:51:16,791 --> 01:51:21,166
But remember,
no one should find out about this.

1666
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:22,666
What should no one know about?

1667
01:51:23,291 --> 01:51:26,458
That you kidnapped Yudhveer.

1668
01:51:26,541 --> 01:51:27,625
Kidnapped him?

1669
01:51:27,875 --> 01:51:30,375
I didn't kidnap anyone!

1670
01:51:34,791 --> 01:51:35,750
Eat this.

1671
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:42,291
You didn't feel ashamed to do this?

1672
01:51:43,333 --> 01:51:44,750
I didn't expect this from you.

1673
01:51:45,125 --> 01:51:46,708
You brought the flat bread
without any butter on it!

1674
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:58,000
Everyone is saying that
you have kidnapped Yudhveer.

1675
01:51:58,291 --> 01:51:59,458
What are you trying to say?

1676
01:51:59,583 --> 01:52:01,416
That I kidnapped him?
Just a minute.

1677
01:52:01,541 --> 01:52:03,750
But sir, your name is
being linked with this case.

1678
01:52:03,833 --> 01:52:05,250
Wouldn't you like to clarify this?

1679
01:52:05,333 --> 01:52:07,583
I should give you a clarification?

1680
01:52:22,125 --> 01:52:23,916
This is amazing, isn't it?

1681
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:26,041
Listen..

1682
01:52:26,791 --> 01:52:28,625
You should have sent buttermilk
with radish stuffed bread.

1683
01:52:28,916 --> 01:52:29,666
Oh really?

1684
01:52:29,833 --> 01:52:30,750
Have you been kidnapped?

1685
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:33,208
Or are you attending a
wedding that we should serve you?

1686
01:52:33,291 --> 01:52:34,833
He is having fun
while being kidnapped.

1687
01:52:35,166 --> 01:52:37,500
Now that you have been kidnapped,
you will have to be patient.

1688
01:52:38,333 --> 01:52:41,750
Fighting with the reporters
won't resolve anything.

1689
01:52:41,833 --> 01:52:43,125
Then how are things resolved?

1690
01:52:43,208 --> 01:52:44,875
Tell me! How?

1691
01:52:45,625 --> 01:52:50,958
Daman, at the moment none
of our moves are falling in place.

1692
01:52:51,875 --> 01:52:55,333
Yudhveer is walking
a step ahead of us.

1693
01:52:56,291 --> 01:53:02,416
If we don't get two steps ahead
of him, we shall have to pay heavily.

1694
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:09,083
You are drinking all by yourself, sir.

1695
01:53:09,375 --> 01:53:11,458
How about sharing some with me?

1696
01:53:11,916 --> 01:53:17,125
A calf no matter how
sated will always seek milk.

1697
01:53:20,291 --> 01:53:21,625
Hush.

1698
01:53:26,958 --> 01:53:27,708
Hello?

1699
01:53:27,875 --> 01:53:29,916
- Jaila.
- Yes, sir?

1700
01:53:30,416 --> 01:53:33,875
Jogi must die.

1701
01:53:55,583 --> 01:53:58,541
- Get him out.
- Ok, sir.

1702
01:54:08,083 --> 01:54:10,708
Come with us.

1703
01:54:10,791 --> 01:54:11,750
Come on.

1704
01:54:12,333 --> 01:54:13,375
Hurry up.

1705
01:54:13,958 --> 01:54:15,375
Where are you taking me?

1706
01:54:15,458 --> 01:54:17,166
- Keep walking.
- Hurry up.

1707
01:54:21,500 --> 01:54:22,333
Go on.

1708
01:54:23,083 --> 01:54:23,916
Sir.

1709
01:54:47,375 --> 01:54:52,125
<i>It is true I was</i>
<i>behind Ex-CM's accident.</i>

1710
01:54:52,458 --> 01:54:55,166
<i>Yudhveer Singh is not guilty.</i>

1711
01:54:55,250 --> 01:54:56,791
<i>He has nothing to do with it.</i>

1712
01:54:57,041 --> 01:55:01,208
<i>Damanjeet Singh told me</i>
<i>to take Yudhveer Singh's name.</i>

1713
01:55:02,166 --> 01:55:06,083
Actually, Damanjeet got Ex-CM killed.

1714
01:55:06,416 --> 01:55:09,583
And now when he feared that
everyone would know the truth..

1715
01:55:09,833 --> 01:55:13,916
..he tried to get me killed
in a fake police encounter.

1716
01:55:25,375 --> 01:55:29,041
Ok Joga, your job is done.

1717
01:55:29,500 --> 01:55:30,958
Ok, bye.

1718
01:55:32,625 --> 01:55:36,708
Yudhveer, why did you let Joga go?

1719
01:55:37,250 --> 01:55:39,291
What if he goes and tells Daman?

1720
01:55:40,041 --> 01:55:41,958
That's why I sent him away.

1721
01:55:42,916 --> 01:55:49,250
He isn't Joga, he is bait.
I have baited Daman.

1722
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:16,291
You made a mistake.
It is not a problem, Joga Singh.

1723
01:56:17,291 --> 01:56:21,750
But you wronged the wrong person.

1724
01:56:23,166 --> 01:56:24,958
Please forgive me, sir.

1725
01:56:26,625 --> 01:56:28,500
Money made me lose my sense.

1726
01:56:28,708 --> 01:56:31,916
For God's sake, please forgive me.

1727
01:56:33,291 --> 01:56:35,041
I want Jaila.

1728
01:56:35,625 --> 01:56:36,583
Tell me!

1729
01:56:37,083 --> 01:56:38,250
Tell me!

1730
01:56:39,416 --> 01:56:42,208
I can tell you where he is.

1731
01:57:03,833 --> 01:57:05,000
Daman..

1732
01:57:09,958 --> 01:57:12,500
Stop!

1733
01:57:12,583 --> 01:57:14,833
Get in. Hop in.

1734
01:57:16,333 --> 01:57:17,458
Let's go.

1735
01:57:30,500 --> 01:57:31,375
Follow them.

1736
01:58:23,875 --> 01:58:28,666
Welcome. Welcome, Yudhveer Singh..

1737
01:58:30,083 --> 01:58:31,416
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1738
01:58:32,041 --> 01:58:37,666
CM sir. CM sir. CM sir.

1739
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:42,291
You ended up at my place..

1740
01:58:42,583 --> 01:58:46,833
..while playing
the cat-and-mouse came.

1741
01:58:47,375 --> 01:58:50,291
You have been unjust to me.

1742
01:58:50,375 --> 01:58:51,833
You have been unjust.

1743
01:58:53,541 --> 01:58:57,500
I like to hunt my prey.

1744
01:58:58,250 --> 01:59:01,833
And you have brought
my prey..

1745
01:59:02,250 --> 01:59:05,541
..right before my gun.

1746
01:59:05,916 --> 01:59:06,916
Very bad.

1747
01:59:07,166 --> 01:59:09,083
Very bad.

1748
01:59:09,833 --> 01:59:12,958
You are very lucky. Very lucky.

1749
01:59:14,291 --> 01:59:16,166
CM has body guards.

1750
01:59:18,375 --> 01:59:20,916
Whereas you have the
CM as your bodyguard.

1751
01:59:24,291 --> 01:59:30,458
Tell your bodyguard
to save you from me.

1752
01:59:31,250 --> 01:59:32,500
Tell him!

1753
01:59:34,791 --> 01:59:36,208
What did you think?

1754
01:59:36,458 --> 01:59:40,625
That he will testify against me?

1755
01:59:41,125 --> 01:59:43,541
He will testify against Damanjeet?

1756
01:59:44,708 --> 01:59:49,666
I will bury his voice and him here.

1757
01:59:49,875 --> 01:59:51,041
Right here.

1758
01:59:51,208 --> 01:59:53,208
What are you saying? Talk sensibly.

1759
01:59:54,458 --> 01:59:57,166
You will have to pay
for this, Daman.

1760
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:58,875
Mr. Dimpy..

1761
02:00:00,291 --> 02:00:04,541
I don't do cheap deals.

1762
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,791
This isn't about cheap or expensive.

1763
02:00:39,916 --> 02:00:42,541
You should know
how to make the deal.

1764
02:00:42,916 --> 02:00:44,208
No!

1765
02:00:45,458 --> 02:00:47,208
Move out of my way!

1766
02:02:07,208 --> 02:02:11,125
<i>In the end the mystery of</i>
<i>deceased Ex-CM Gurpyaar Singh..</i>

1767
02:02:11,208 --> 02:02:14,458
<i>..was solved in such a dramatic</i>
<i>way that it seems unbelievable.</i>

1768
02:02:14,625 --> 02:02:19,125
<i>It has been proven that his</i>
<i>nephew Damanjeet Singh got him killed.</i>

1769
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:24,500
<i>He falsely accused Yudhveer</i>
<i>for it so that he can get rid of him.</i>

1770
02:02:24,583 --> 02:02:27,958
<i>Yudhveer has been</i>
<i>proven innocent in this case.</i>

1771
02:02:28,125 --> 02:02:30,416
<i>The whole of Punjab</i>
<i>is happy with this news.</i>

1772
02:02:37,416 --> 02:02:38,916
Ladies and gentlemen..

1773
02:02:39,041 --> 02:02:44,833
I present to you the famous
mimicry artist Dimpy Dhaliwal.

1774
02:02:45,291 --> 02:02:48,250
From the operation theater, he
comes straight to an open-air theater.

1775
02:02:48,333 --> 02:02:49,541
Applause.

1776
02:02:52,875 --> 02:02:54,958
Those whose hands are fine.

1777
02:02:55,125 --> 02:02:58,958
I mean those who are not
wearing a sling can applaud.

1778
02:02:59,041 --> 02:02:59,916
I don't mind.

1779
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:06,000
Now I would request the
new Chief Minister of Punjab..

1780
02:03:06,083 --> 02:03:10,375
..Mr. Yudhveer Singh
Sidhu to come to the stage.

1781
02:03:11,208 --> 02:03:13,208
Go ahead, CM sir.

1782
02:03:16,083 --> 02:03:19,166
I am not a CM.
And I don't want to go on the stage.

1783
02:03:19,250 --> 02:03:20,333
What?

1784
02:03:22,375 --> 02:03:24,125
What kind of a
drama is this now?

1785
02:03:25,750 --> 02:03:30,458
We have done a lot to reach here.
We have risked our lives.

1786
02:03:30,750 --> 02:03:33,000
Let bygones be bygones.

1787
02:03:34,333 --> 02:03:36,125
Instead of trying to get more..

1788
02:03:36,208 --> 02:03:40,083
..I would like to treasure
what I already have.

1789
02:03:40,250 --> 02:03:43,708
Yudhveer,
God has given you the strength.

1790
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:46,125
You can take care of the whole Punjab.

1791
02:03:46,291 --> 02:03:47,958
You only love us.

1792
02:03:48,416 --> 02:03:52,250
But what about the love that people
of Punjab have shown towards you?

1793
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:55,541
You cannot betray their love,
Yudhveer.

1794
02:03:56,375 --> 02:03:57,333
Yudhveer.

1795
02:03:57,875 --> 02:04:04,625
Punjab lost pride and
your father's lost respect..

1796
02:04:05,625 --> 02:04:07,041
Only you can get it back.

1797
02:04:20,916 --> 02:04:25,791
<i>"Millions of people.."</i>

1798
02:04:31,666 --> 02:04:37,000
<i>"Millions of people have</i>
<i>given you this responsibility."</i>

1799
02:04:37,333 --> 02:04:42,666
<i>"Fulfill your duty</i>
<i>with an honest heart."</i>

1800
02:04:42,958 --> 02:04:47,333
<i>"Now it is your turn."</i>

1801
02:04:48,041 --> 02:04:52,958
<i>"You have to fulfill your father's.."</i>

1802
02:04:53,375 --> 02:04:56,000
<i>"You have to fulfill your father's.."</i>

1803
02:04:56,083 --> 02:04:58,958
<i>"..incomplete dream."</i>

1804
02:04:59,041 --> 02:05:04,333
<i>"Lie doesn't last, says Nanak,</i>
<i>in the end truth prevails."</i>

1805
02:05:04,500 --> 02:05:09,875
<i>"Lie doesn't last, says Nanak,</i>
<i>in the end truth prevails."</i>

1806
02:05:20,708 --> 02:05:23,166
<i>"He was true in the beginning.</i>
<i>He was true through all ages."</i>

1807
02:05:23,416 --> 02:05:25,791
<i>"He is true even now.</i>
<i>He shall ever be true."</i>

1808
02:05:26,125 --> 02:05:28,583
<i>"He was true in the beginning.</i>
<i>He was true through all ages."</i>

1809
02:05:28,833 --> 02:05:31,375
<i>"He is true even now.</i>
<i>He shall ever be true."</i>

1810
02:05:31,583 --> 02:05:34,041
<i>"He was true in the beginning.</i>
<i>He was true through all ages."</i>

1811
02:05:34,291 --> 02:05:36,833
<i>"He is true even now.</i>
<i>He shall ever be true."</i>

1812
02:05:37,041 --> 02:05:39,500
<i>"He was true in the beginning.</i>
<i>He was true through all ages."</i>

1813
02:05:39,750 --> 02:05:43,750
<i>"He is true even now.</i>
<i>He shall ever be true."</i>

1814
02:05:48,625 --> 02:05:54,666
The people have voted and
Yudhveer Singh has become the CM.

1815
02:05:54,791 --> 02:06:00,625
Behind me is a group ready
to welcome our new CM.

1816
02:06:00,708 --> 02:06:03,958
We are eager to
congratulate him.

1817
02:06:19,666 --> 02:06:24,250
- Long live Yudhveer!
- Long live Yudhveer!

1818
02:07:27,541 --> 02:07:30,625
"You don't get lucky
with the ultimate power.."

1819
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,666
"..you strive and earn it."

1820
02:07:45,208 --> 02:07:49,208
Long live CM sir! - Yudhveer!

1821
02:07:49,291 --> 02:07:52,958
Long live CM sir! - Yudhveer!

1822
02:07:58,416 --> 02:08:02,250
Long live CM sir! - Yudhveer!

1823
02:08:02,333 --> 02:08:07,500
Long live CM sir! - Yudhveer!

1824
02:08:11,083 --> 02:08:14,750
<i>"He was true in the beginning.</i>
<i>He was true through all ages."</i>

1825
02:08:15,125 --> 02:08:18,833
<i>"He is true even now.</i>
<i>He shall ever be true."</i>

1826
02:08:19,125 --> 02:08:22,791
<i>"He was true in the beginning.</i>
<i>He was true through all ages."</i>

1827
02:08:23,166 --> 02:08:26,875
<i>"He is true even now.</i>
<i>He shall ever be true."</i>
