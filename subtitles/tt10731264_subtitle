1
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,640
Sukhi, is the stable visible?

2
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,560
Yes, bro.

3
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,640
Then start recording.

4
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,600
Hello, Peeps!

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,360
I am Suraj Singh Dhillon,
and this is Bombay!

6
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,600
A city that never sleeps,
but yet, is called the city of dreams.

7
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,120
The only city in the world
where distance is measured in time,

8
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,840
because time here is money.

9
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,600
That's why my dad took a timely decision
and shifted here from Punjab.

10
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,400
Hey!

11
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,400
Hey!

12
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,760
He toiled hard, but with no success.

13
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,280
Then my mom,
a dame from Mathura entered his life,

14
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,320
bringing 10 buffalos along with her.

15
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:08,400
Albeit my dad still
has just one wife, my mom,

16
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,960
but we now have 312 buffalos,
127 cows, 7 bulls, 4 oxen,

17
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,280
and one humongous stable.

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,440
We sell milk with many milk products
"thrown" into the mix.

19
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,240
We also have a beautiful house.

20
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,040
This is all thanks to Mumba Devi,
the city goddess!

21
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,000
I have to say,
our house would look much better

22
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,080
had dad painted it in
the colour I'd suggested.

23
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,360
But that's my dad for you.

24
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,840
Who is it?

25
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,800
And that's my mom for you.

26
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,720
Now all I need is a beautiful,
well-cultured Wife,

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,560
who wouldn't let mom enter the kitchen,

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,120
and wouldn't let me leave the bedroom.

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,640
My ideal woman!

30
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,280
He'll surely end up
with a beautiful girl.

31
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,320
My son is so handsome, after all.

32
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,320
Okay son,
it's time to ward off the evil now.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,360
Mom, I'm standing right next to you.

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,320
Oh.

35
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,720
Okay son, it's time to ward off...

36
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,240
Cut! Cut! Cut!

37
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,800
Even God cannot claim
to completely understand women.

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,520
You know why?

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,880
Because he doesn't have a sister.

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,840
But I have no problem in that,
because I do have a sister, Guddi.

41
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,480
She's an eighth grader.

42
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
And he flunked the eighth grade, twice.

43
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,200
Hey, but I can finish reading
a comic book in just two hours.

44
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,480
I'm looking for a devoted
wife who'd go without food and water

45
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,120
on Vatpurnima to pray for my long life.

46
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,840
Will you be that
thirsty and hungry girl?

47
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,360
Cut.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,920
I said cut, Sukhi.

49
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,240
How is it?

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,160
Excellent, bro.

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,160
You know this video isn't for me?

52
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,240
It's for those poor girls,

53
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,480
whom never end up getting proposals
from good looking and handsome boys.

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,200
- Oh....
- Yes.

55
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,120
But bro, what's Vatpurnima?

56
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,960
It's a Maharashtrian festival,

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,800
wherein a wife ties a thread
around a banyan tree,

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,920
prays for her husband's long life
and sings melodious songs.

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,560
Enough!

60
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh my, sister!

61
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,440
You have such a sweet voice.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,520
Do you sing professionally?

63
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,760
Really?

64
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,640
My husband says so too.

65
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,560
Oh.

66
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,920
You are not a bad singer either.

67
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:30,120
It's just that you
sound a little... um, manly.

68
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,800
You see, my husband has a soft voice.

69
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,360
He sounds just like a woman.

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,840
So... we manage.

71
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,400
Where do you stay?

72
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,480
Shivam Colony, Girgaon.

73
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,200
Oh, I've friends who stay there,
the Dicholkars.

74
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,960
They own a grocery store in Lalbaug.

75
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,640
- The Dicholkars?
- Right.

76
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,920
They are my neighbours.

77
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh.

78
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,200
Their flat is right next to mine.

79
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,720
Small world.

80
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,160
They are such nice people.

81
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,800
Right, they are very nice.

82
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,520
Their son,
Dinesh, is also good, it's just that...

83
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920
What?

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,120
Sister, I know everyone's ins and outs.

85
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,560
Well, it is what it is,
you can't do anything about it.

86
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,280
Yeah... about what?

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,640
His intentions.

88
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,160
He sells adulterated grains.

89
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,280
Instead of a kilo,
you end up with only 800 grams.

90
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,440
Everybody does that these days.

91
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,160
Come on.

92
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,800
But he is a nice boy.

93
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,360
- Yes, he is.
- He has no bad habits either.

94
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,320
He doesn't, right?

95
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,840
No, he has no bad habits as such.

96
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,120
It'd be all good as he'd stop visiting
the dance bar once he gets married.

97
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,640
Dance bar?

98
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,480
Yeah.

99
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,560
The Sapna Bar, in Sion?

100
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,200
Oh.

101
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,280
Oh yes.

102
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,560
Well, it is what it is.

103
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,280
Anyway sister, I'll get going.

104
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,880
Sure.

105
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
Hey, I didn't get your name.

106
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,600
What is it?

107
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,640
My name?

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,360
Yes.

109
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,840
Shakuntala,

110
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,680
but my husband affectionately
calls me honey.

111
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,120
In his soft voice?

112
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,640
Come on now!

113
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,000
Naughty sister.

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,080
Naughty, huh.

115
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,880
Later.
See you, bye.

116
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,000
Excuse me mister, Sapna Dance Bar?

117
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,640
Let's go already!

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,800
Are you bloody blind?

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,920
Don't you know how to drive?

120
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,360
Here, have an orange.

121
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,880
It's improves ones' eyesight.

122
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,800
Let's go.

123
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,520
Cheers.

124
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,000
Cheers.

125
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,480
He's alcoholic,
dishonest, a womaniser and a gambler.

126
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,920
He has all the possible vices.

127
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,200
Thank you, Madhu.

128
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,200
You have saved our daughter's future
from being ruined.

129
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,800
You are an angel.

130
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,520
- No, no, no, sir.
- Thank you so much.

131
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,840
No, aunt. I am just doing my job.

132
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,200
No good girl should
ever end up with a bad boy.

133
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,840
So I have vowed.

134
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,760
Now you just need to find
a better match for Varsha, okay?

135
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,680
Here's your fees.

136
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,320
Okay.

137
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,640
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

138
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,080
Listen,

139
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,520
once you find another boy, come to me
for his character certificate.

140
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,560
After all, it's the question
of your daughter's life.

141
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,920
You cannot leave that on chance.

142
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,240
Goodbye.

143
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,600
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

144
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,920
Let's go.

145
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,000
What's this?

146
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,240
We've spent more than
we made on this case, Kaka!

147
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,920
Who asked you to do
such elaborate disguises?

148
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:33,840
Huh?

149
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,080
A Sindhi businessman,
a middle-aged woman...

150
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,600
You even wanted to try out
all the fruits to get the size right.

151
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,200
I bought half a kilo
of each fruit for the trials.

152
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,720
Oranges,

153
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,840
sapodilla,

154
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,120
watermelon,

155
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,360
and apples.

156
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,040
And what were a dozen
of bananas used for?

157
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,640
They were for me to consume, son.

158
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,720
Getting these things is so tiring.

159
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,520
That's where the bananas,
biryani and a cab ride come in.

160
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,520
They are my personal expenses.

161
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,600
I am not young anymore.

162
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,320
My health... well, I don't keep well.

163
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,760
No one eats biryani
when not feeling well.

164
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,720
And not mutton biryani for sure.

165
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,080
The taste is still
lingering in the mouth, huh?

166
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,960
I hired you after your mill
shut down thinking that it'd benefit me.

167
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,160
But you sir, lead a royal life.

168
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,440
Look, when your dad was in need...

169
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,600
Right, you gave him 1200 bucks
when he was in need.

170
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,080
But you've consumed biryani
worth 10,000 in the past 8 years,

171
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,680
and I have bills to prove that.
Do you want me to show them to you, huh?

172
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,080
- Do you?
- Madhu! Why are you yelling?

173
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,440
My customer is relaxing in the parlour.

174
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,720
And who's this customer of yours, huh?

175
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,480
Aunt Deshmukh, right?

176
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,440
Who is it?

177
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,320
Hey aunt, it's me, Madhu.
How are you doing?

178
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,800
Live long, lad.

179
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,440
Why stop at that?

180
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,280
Say, live long and keep
screwing up youngsters' lives.

181
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,080
Rekha.

182
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
You cannot stop yourself
from taunting everyone, can you?

183
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,600
Your son is so smart
but you are never pleased with him.

184
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,200
Heard that?

185
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,880
Aunt, I have managed
to save 47 girls so far.

186
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,320
I have received so many blessings.

187
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,280
You went past the marriageable age busy
trying to call off other's marriages.

188
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,800
I wanted grandchildren
and I am getting blessings instead.

189
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,440
What do I do with the blessings,
pickle them?

190
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,000
One day you shall know what
a great job your son is doing.

191
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,160
- Then, you will stop taunting me.
- Of course.

192
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:36,000
He used to say the same when
he was in his college's dramatics team.

193
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,200
"I am the best actor."

194
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,680
"I'll work in Subhash Bhai's movie."

195
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,280
It's Subhash Ghai and not Subhash Bhai.

196
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,320
Gh.

197
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,560
Whatever.
Did you get to work with him, huh?

198
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,560
He's unnecessarily
spying on poor young boys.

199
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,080
Whom are you addressing
as poor young boys?

200
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,680
All of them are hooligans.

201
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,760
I am no fool.

202
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,560
There is no decent boy in Bombay

203
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,320
whom Madhu Mangal Rane
could mistake as a hooligan.

204
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,320
Understood me?

205
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,000
Why bother with matching
the horoscopes, Yashoda?

206
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,160
What's the harm in matchmaking?

207
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,760
He's my son too, you know.

208
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,120
According to the priest,

209
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,240
Suraj and Mr. Sharma's daughter
have 28 matching attributes.

210
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,240
Really?

211
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,520
Fine, then.

212
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,920
My son has a lot of attributes.

213
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,080
Of course, they are bound to match.

214
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,480
Attributes must match in order
to have a successful marriage.

215
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,280
Son, this marriage will also get rid of the
red planet's bad influence on your charts.

216
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,360
Then you'll have nothing to worry about.

217
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,200
Okay, mom.

218
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,320
Listen,

219
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,400
you need to talk to that girl in English.

220
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,440
Got it?

221
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
From A to Zee.

222
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,480
Dad, I will shut her up with my English.

223
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,680
Come on, bro!

224
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,480
Shut up.

225
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,000
I mean... she will be speechless
with my perfect English.

226
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:41,880
This is no time to be pompous.

227
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,520
This is the time to impress.

228
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,880
But at this speed there's
no way we'll reach there on time.

229
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,160
Why don't you change the gear?

230
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,080
I'll change it right away.

231
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,880
Move it!

232
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,200
Move aside! Do you have a death wish?

233
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,720
Just run him over.

234
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,560
So son, you handle
your dad's dairy business?

235
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,600
Yes, uncle.

236
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,880
I handle dad's milk.

237
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,640
I mean I handle his milk business, aunty.

238
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,880
And we also start throwing
curd and butter all over the market.

239
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:15,920
Well packaged, under the label
of Jai Matarani Doodh Bhandar.

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,240
We will make it multinational.

241
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,880
Very good.

242
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,840
My daughter...

243
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,640
Preeti.

244
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

245
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

246
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,080
Have a seat, dear.

247
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,760
Why don't you come and sit here instead?

248
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Right.

249
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,680
Sit here, dear. I'll sit there.

250
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,400
Hello.

251
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,440
I am Hello... eh, Suraj.

252
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,560
So you have a dairy?

253
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,320
Oh yes.

254
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,800
We "throw" milk all over the market.

255
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,880
Why don't you drop by for some pudding?

256
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,160
What?

257
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,520
I mean, you come to my dairy
and I'll "milk" you something nice.

258
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,440
- Oh...
- Yeah.

259
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,160
- Nice.
- Yes.

260
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,280
Hmm.

261
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,680
What's that smell?

262
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,880
What smell, dear?

263
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,000
Something certainly reeks of raw butter.

264
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,240
Only the rich smell like butter.

265
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,400
She didn't have to make a big deal of it.

266
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,480
Well, your hands get dirty
when working in a coal mine.

267
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,440
Zip it.

268
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,840
Sorry, bro.

269
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,840
You cannot differentiate
between coal and butter?

270
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,160
Such an idiot.

271
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,960
- I was just giving analogy.
- Analogy?

272
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,000
We lost such a good match.

273
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,080
And you are giving analogies!

274
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,920
Now we only have that girl
from Dadar to fall back on.

275
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,320
The one the priest had suggested.

276
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,760
But her attributes didn't match with bro.

277
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,600
Attributes don't matter,
their hearts need to be in sync.

278
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,080
Matching the attributes is not necessary.

279
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,320
Hypocrite!

280
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,160
Zip it.

281
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,600
- Listen up.
- Yes, dad?

282
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,280
You need to work your magic on her.

283
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,960
Okay, dad.

284
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,240
Like I had used my magic on your mom.

285
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:13,080
Okay, dad.

286
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,560
How did he do it, aunt?

287
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,480
Drop it.

288
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,600
Please tell us. Tell us! Tell us!

289
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,280
Tell us!

290
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,880
I can only talk when you stop talking!

291
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,160
Fine, tell us.

292
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,120
He used to visit our stable to buy milk.

293
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,640
My father started liking him.

294
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,920
He gave 22 of his best
buffalos to us as a wedding gift.

295
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,840
That's the reason Matarani Doodh
Bhandar is flourishing the way it is.

296
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:35,880
Right?

297
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,760
Absolutely.

298
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,360
So it's love marriage cum
arranged marriage with dowry.

299
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,000
Well played, uncle.

300
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,560
I've never come across such a player!

301
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,960
Sorry, dad.

302
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,840
Bro, this is what the girls
want these days...

303
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,160
Wild, daredevil, bad ass dudes. Players!

304
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,560
Girls fall for such guys.

305
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,240
You'll have to do something like this.

306
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,120
So you want me,

307
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,600
to make an entrance by doing
a split on two buffalos?

308
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,240
A slip and I will split myself in two!

309
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Bro, bikes and buffalos
are two different things.

310
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
What are you saying?

311
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,200
This is 1995 style of romance.

312
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,640
We are just 5 years away
from the 21st century.

313
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,600
We'll soon enter a new millennium.

314
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,360
Don't worry.

315
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,600
I'll make you...
what's the new word used these days?

316
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,200
Cool!

317
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,240
I'll make you cool.

318
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,440
- Cool?
- Right.

319
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,920
"It's time!..."

320
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,800
"Tomorrow another coolie
will refuse to pay the tax."

321
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,880
Hey no one asked me for the tax,
so whom do I refuse?

322
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
It's a dialogue from the movie Deewar.

323
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,600
Amitabh Bachchan had said those lines.

324
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,280
Okay.

325
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,640
He was a bad boy in it.

326
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,160
Now it's your turn to be a bad boy.

327
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,080
Bad boy?

328
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,040
Bad boy.

329
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,040
Bad boy.

330
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,880
Bad boy.

331
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,080
Joker!

332
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,440
What?

333
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,960
Nothing, we're playing cards.

334
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,280
Carry on then.

335
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,800
Boring family.

336
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,960
Hey, stay away.

337
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Spare him some change, bro.

338
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,200
Beggar.

339
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,520
Can a bad boy donate?

340
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,560
Yes, he can.

341
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,800
Stay away.

342
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,480
Go, have fun.

343
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,280
Get going.

344
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,320
You too, bro.

345
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,440
Signal is red.

346
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,160
Bro, remember, bad boy?

347
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:02,920
Should I?

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,360
- Bad boy.
- Yeah, bad boy.

349
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:05,520
Go for it!

350
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,000
What a Jerk!

351
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,440
Chug! Chug! Chug!

352
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,160
Go for it.

353
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,000
Sukhi?

354
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:56,640
Yes, bro.

355
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,680
I think I had a little
too much to drink.

356
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,440
No problem, take your time.

357
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,160
Don't you think I am overdoing it?

358
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,520
This is what bad boys do.

359
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,200
Really?

360
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,680
Yes, bro.

361
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,680
Then here you go.

362
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,040
And here you go.

363
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Let's go fishing in the pee!

364
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,720
Let's go fishing in the pee!

365
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,040
There we go.

366
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,440
They are here.

367
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,240
Hi, priest.

368
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,200
Hmm.

369
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,200
Uncle.

370
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,600
Hello.

371
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

372
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,480
I think you'll be my wife.

373
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,240
Hello.

374
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,520
Nice house, uncle.

375
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:24,640
Mr. Dhillon, you'd said
that your son's a decent boy.

376
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,040
Yes, he is.

377
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,240
He has no vices?

378
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,160
No, he doesn't.

379
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,680
Then what the hell is this?

380
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:31,840
What is this?

381
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:32,760
Pass them over.

382
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
Here you go.

383
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,720
What is it, Sukhi?

384
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,920
Stand up!

385
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,240
What's wrong, dad?

386
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,280
I said stand up.

387
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,520
What is wrong, dad?

388
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,400
What is this?

389
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,040
What is it?

390
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,960
What?

391
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Oh this?

392
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,000
Uncle, you're getting this all wrong.

393
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,800
Mom, dad, I am not having beer.

394
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,080
I was experimenting on mixing
barley water and milk

395
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,440
so that we can "throw"
another product into the market.

396
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,160
I'll be the one "throwing" you out, son.

397
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,680
I think Sukhi is responsible for this.

398
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,640
Sukhi?!

399
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,280
Mr. Dhillon, I had painted
such a good picture before Mr. Charan.

400
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,600
He was so pleased.

401
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,600
I didn't expect this from you.

402
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,640
Go inside, dear.

403
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,440
Mr. Dhillon, I think you should leave.

404
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,760
Son, you should meet me outside.

405
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,600
Do you plan to leave anytime soon?

406
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,560
Let's go.

407
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,120
Sorry, bro!

408
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,440
Please, bro!

409
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,200
That's enough, bro.

410
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,240
That's enough, bro.

411
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,200
You bloody traitor!

412
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,800
Bro!

413
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,480
Bro! Bro! Bro!

414
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,960
Please don't, bro!

415
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,440
I made sure you got more milk
than the calf did!

416
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,320
Why?... So that you grow up
and screw my life over?

417
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,320
Hey, I didn't know
someone's clicking pictures.

418
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,640
Instead of being portrayed
as Amitabh Bachchan, a super star,

419
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,800
I ended up being portrayed
as a lecherous villain.

420
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,760
Everyone in the community now thinks
that I am an alcoholic and a womaniser.

421
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,800
You'd said bad boy is a good thing.
But I ended up being a joke, man.

422
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,480
I agree I made a mistake.

423
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:38,400
But I was only trying to get you a girl.

424
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,560
Hey!

425
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,720
He means a girl for marriage.

426
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,800
Get back to work.

427
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,000
And you mister,
go and find out who's behind this.

428
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,640
I had beer for the first time in 28 years

429
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,360
and someone managed to click
my picture chugging it.

430
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,320
It's very strange.

431
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,320
Right when we were looking at a girl...
fine, eyeing her,

432
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,400
someone used it as opportunity
to present me in a bad light.

433
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,560
Right.

434
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,800
I never thought about it.

435
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,280
This means someone was following us.

436
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,720
Please stop following me.
I cannot help you anymore.

437
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,400
But you know what kind of a boy I am.

438
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,000
I don't even look at my buffalos
when they are having a bath.

439
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,400
I am not a bad boy.

440
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,160
No, he's not.

441
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,760
I know, but I can't help it.

442
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,360
Mr. Charan has pictures proving otherwise.

443
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,280
How do I explain it to him?

444
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:20,640
He has anyway contacted another priest,

445
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,640
and fixed his girl's marriage
with someone else.

446
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
I ended up suffering a loss.

447
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,200
- You are only losing money.
- Hey.

448
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,600
I am losing my youth.

449
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,800
Yes aunty, please continue.

450
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,400
I am losing my youthfulness, sir.

451
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,920
You can cover your loss by
working part time in Jaibharat Times.

452
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,680
That's my full time job,
I do this part time.

453
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,200
But this is what helps me pay the bills.

454
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,600
But nothing is helping me!

455
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,080
I have ended up with a bad image.

456
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,800
My mom's planning to go
to Vaishnao Devi to offer prayers,

457
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,280
so that I get back on the right track.

458
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,040
Really?

459
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,000
Has she decided on a priest yet?

460
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,960
I have a lot of time to spare.

461
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:47,600
Damn it.

462
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,040
But I don't have much time left.

463
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,480
Please tell me who has caused this mess.

464
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,840
No, I cannot give you his name.

465
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,040
It took a lot of effort
to get a name out of Mr. Charan.

466
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,360
- Who is it? Please tell us.
- Please uncle.

467
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,800
Son, I am not a money minded guy.

468
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,400
Pay him, he never minds money.

469
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,880
- Here you go.
- That's 50 bucks.

470
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
Madhu Mangal Rane.

471
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:05,920
What?

472
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,200
Madhu... Mangal... Rane.

473
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,160
Resides in Sarode Chawl, Girgaon.

474
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,040
Who is he?

475
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,080
Wedding detective.

476
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,600
- Wedding detective?
- Someone who checks on grooms?

477
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,080
Yes.

478
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:14,760
What does he exactly do?

479
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,760
He spies on prospective grooms.

480
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,560
If he catches them doing
anything inappropriate,

481
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,400
he immediately reports
it to the bride's family.

482
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,680
No one has been able to escape him.

483
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,960
- Thank you.
- Go, have fun.

484
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,640
Get going.

485
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,560
You too, bro.

486
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,040
Yeah, bad boy.

487
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,600
Go for it!

488
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,840
What a jerk!

489
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,200
This is what bad boys do.

490
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,280
- Really?
- Yes, bro.

491
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,600
Then here you go.

492
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,960
And here you go.

493
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,720
This rascal is responsible
for many marriages being called off.

494
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,400
He ruins income opportunities
for priests like me

495
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,840
and the wedding opportunities
for boys like you.

496
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,000
Just to make some extra bucks.

497
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,800
This Mangal is just as toxic
and dangerous as his namesake red planet.

498
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:20,040
Your life is ruined
once he enters your life.

499
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,440
If he is Mangal,
the red planet, then I am Suraj, the Sun!

500
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,160
And I am Sukhi, the sidekick!

501
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,200
Wedding detective.

502
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,600
Never heard of such a profession, bro.

503
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,440
He should be called
a Wedding destroyer instead.

504
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,400
Right.

505
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,600
So what do we do now?

506
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,600
First we need to find
out who exactly he is.

507
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,440
Correct.

508
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,440
But how?

509
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,560
By using his own methods on him.

510
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,560
To understand a dog,
you need to become a dog, Sukhi.

511
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,080
Who knows what game that
dog must be playing right now?

512
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,920
Undertaker!

513
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,080
Come on brats, give me your cards.

514
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,000
How can you play
the Undertaker card again?

515
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,720
- This is cheating.
- Yes, you are cheating.

516
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,120
This is how all losers squall.

517
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,800
Winners never squall.

518
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,520
Got it?

519
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,440
Cheaters don't either.

520
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,160
Who are you calling a cheater, bonehead?

521
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,440
Who are you calling a bonehead?

522
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,240
- Just give me my card back.
- Let's go, guys.

523
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,200
I don't want to play with you anymore.

524
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,600
- We don't want to play with you either.
- He always does this.

525
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,720
Buzz off.

526
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,640
Look, the flop actor is back
to being a drama queen!

527
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
- Buzz off!
- Scram!

528
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,280
Hey, flop actor!

529
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,520
Still a sore loser, huh?

530
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,680
Hey...

531
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,480
No, these kids are troublesome brats.

532
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,800
Don't you dare come here again, got it?

533
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,200
What case did you want to talk about?

534
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,960
Remember Mr. Bhatia from Bhandup?

535
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,400
He had rejected a boy's proposal
and now that boy is troubling him.

536
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:34,760
Okay.

537
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,560
Here's... his card.

538
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,320
Hmm.

539
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,360
He's a vegetable trader by profession.

540
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:39,680
Hmm.

541
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,880
Give him a call.

542
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,600
All good at home?

543
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,880
All good.

544
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:46,640
See you.

545
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,840
Dada!

546
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,440
What?

547
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,560
Lunch is ready.

548
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,440
I'm coming.

549
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,240
- How are you doing, uncle?
- Good.

550
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
Tulsi? What is this, kiddo?

551
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,920
You took just one bread!

552
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,520
I have tuitions, mom.

553
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,160
I cannot eat much.

554
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,200
Have some more.

555
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,320
You won't gain weight.

556
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,520
She thinks she won't get married
if she gets fat.

557
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
She's going to get married
pretty soon, mom.

558
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,280
I have already short-listed two boys.

559
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,480
Decent, smart and with government jobs.

560
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,520
One's working as a clerk
in the Municipal Cooperation.

561
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,680
The other is ticket checker
at Kurla railway station.

562
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,400
Well done.

563
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,640
Where did you find them?

564
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,440
I was spying on two rascals.

565
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,480
Okay.

566
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,040
They are their friends.

567
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,120
Oh, I see.

568
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,520
I have their pictures as well.

569
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,760
Show me their pictures.

570
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,120
Let me finish eating first, mom.

571
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,880
Please. You just started eating.

572
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,120
Come on.

573
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,600
Tulsi, pass me my bag.

574
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,720
Give it here, Tulsi.

575
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,440
Pass it over.

576
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,280
My son finally did something right.

577
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,400
Hey, it's my bag!

578
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,120
It's okay.
I'll find them. You enjoy your meal.

579
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,640
Like them?

580
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,360
They are fine.

581
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,960
Tulsi, you, too, have a look.

582
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,480
I don't need to.

583
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm fine with Dada's and your choice.

584
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,600
I'll do as you say
once my tuitions are over.

585
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:10,960
There.

586
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
Now that's a well-cultured girl.

587
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,240
An ideal, homely, Indian woman.

588
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,720
Who's sister is she?

589
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,360
Yours.

590
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,200
Right.

591
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,360
You, too, should find a nice
middle aged woman for yourself.

592
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,080
I doubt you'll get a girl at this age.

593
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,760
Really?

594
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,480
Huh?

595
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,200
You really don't think before you speak.

596
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,240
I'm only speaking the truth.

597
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,440
Just won't lose an opportunity to taunt.

598
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,840
Hey, don't get up from
the middle of the meal, Dada.

599
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,000
Finish your lunch.
Don't mind her.

600
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,360
I'm going to get an onion.

601
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,520
I'd die of starvation
if I start minding her.

602
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,000
Bro, why do we need to rent clothes?

603
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,400
Our dairy business is doing well, right?

604
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,680
Shut up, Sukhi.

605
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,080
I know what I am doing.

606
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,040
Uncle, I need a beard wig,
big one, like the Pathans have.

607
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,640
I also need the turban
and the clothes they wear.

608
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,720
All the works.

609
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,840
And a burqa for him.

610
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,760
A burqa?

611
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,560
Bro, I, too, want a beard.

612
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,480
Why do I need to dress up as a woman?

613
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,440
Zip it.

614
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,240
Where all do I need
to attach these, uncle?

615
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,200
It's not like that, sonny boy.

616
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:25,200
Here, let me help you.

617
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:29,520
You tie it like this.

618
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,240
Look in the mirror.

619
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,600
You work in a theatre?

620
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,760
Something like that.

621
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,280
But our group consists of just one actor,

622
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,920
a reincarnated frustrated
actor who loves to overact.

623
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,160
Vishnu, you know of any place
that serves good biryani?

624
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,040
I know one, Mohammad Kebabs,
it's in the next lane.

625
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:56,960
Oh thanks!

626
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:57,760
Nice meeting you, uncle.

627
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,040
Okay.
Okay, okay.

628
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,160
Hey sister...

629
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,040
Stop walking like a man.

630
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,680
Get rid of your manliness
and show some grace.

631
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,200
No one should be able to guess the
content just by looking at the package.

632
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,320
Hmm.

633
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,000
Hey mister, where can I
find wedding detective's office?

634
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,960
Next to that beauty parlour.

635
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,240
Greetings and Salutations!

636
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,760
Greetings.

637
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
Don't get carried away.
They aren't always so cordial.

638
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,200
Try to speak like me.

639
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,040
- Don't get me started on how you sound.
- Whatever.

640
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,640
What the...!

641
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,120
What is he doing here?

642
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,720
What if he's Madhu Mangal Rane?

643
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Let's try coming here at night.

644
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,080
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

645
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,280
Thank you.

646
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,640
See you, mom.

647
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,800
Ride safe.

648
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,400
Bye.

649
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,480
In a wave moment,
there are some quantities

650
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,640
which change its values
with time and space.

651
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,760
Hello, Kokate Sir.

652
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:30,360
Madam, you just cannot enter from
the front door and exit from the rear.

653
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:31,960
Hello madam, do you hear me?

654
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,320
Hurry up, Madhu. I am sleepy.

655
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,440
Whose life are you going to ruin today?

656
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,480
Mishra Ice Cream, Dadar.

657
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,040
That's my favourite!

658
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,640
I have information
from a reliable source...

659
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,320
Mishra's casanova son
amps up the heat in...

660
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,200
...his ice cream parlour
after the working hours.

661
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,080
Eew!

662
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
I'll be back in two hours.

663
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:56,960
Wait up.

664
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,560
Get me a sundae from
his shop on your way back.

665
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,520
- Really!
- Yes.

666
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:04,080
I deserve one last sundae
before he shuts shop.

667
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,040
What...? Geez!

668
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,200
Why have you made me wear
an overcoat in such a weather?

669
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,600
It's better than the
burqa you made me wear.

670
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,640
This is what spies wear at night.

671
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,280
I think only morons would step out
at night wearing such garbs.

672
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,800
Look.

673
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,080
Hello.

674
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

675
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,760
Where are you going dressed like that?

676
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,800
Heard that? I told you.

677
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:30,880
That's what I've been telling him.

678
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Who steps out at night wearing such togs?

679
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,520
Excuse me mister,
but where are you going dressed like that?

680
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,000
Whom do you intend to rob?

681
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,080
Just a bunch of bourgeois here.

682
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,760
We are not thieves.

683
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,680
Do we look like thieves to you?
Really?

684
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,000
We just stepped out for a night walk.

685
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:48,800
It's the new culture.

686
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,520
- Yes, culture. New culture.
- New culture.

687
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,720
Good.

688
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,160
Don't even think about
stealing from this place.

689
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,160
Understood me?

690
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,560
Ya, ya.

691
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,360
- Later.
- Later.

692
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,400
Ya, huh!

693
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,720
Who was he, bro?

694
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,280
Didn't he look like a loafer to you?

695
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,600
I couldn't really see his face.

696
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:08,560
Then why even bother asking?

697
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,440
Let's go.

698
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,480
Bloody...

699
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,600
Found it!

700
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,040
Sukhi, I found my file.

701
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,560
You did?

702
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,080
He's labelled me as "milkman".

703
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,480
- Not as "dairy owner"?
- Nope.

704
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,280
He has negatives and all.

705
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,240
Negatives? What else?

706
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,880
He even has our electricity bill.

707
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,320
But why?

708
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,760
Gosh, do we really get
such an exorbitant bill?

709
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,800
I don't know. How much is it?

710
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,400
- Sukhi.
- Hmm?

711
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,720
My picture.

712
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,840
Kickass, bro.
Isn't it?

713
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,760
Under the unwanted section?

714
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,360
That rascal has put
a red cross on my picture.

715
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,480
Let me see.

716
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Dada?

717
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,640
Kaka, is that you?

718
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,680
Who is it?

719
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,880
Run, bro!

720
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,080
Sorry, sister, sorry. Sorry.

721
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,680
Thief...

722
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,720
Thief! Thief! Thief! Get them!

723
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,560
Mom! Kaka!

724
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,200
Thief! Thief!

725
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,640
Reeks of butter!

726
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,880
But he didn't steal any money.

727
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,120
Madhu.

728
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:29,880
Yeah?

729
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,840
That's strange, don't you think?

730
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:37,840
He didn't come here to steal anything.

731
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,960
Then what did he come here for?

732
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:44,280
To check whether it was me,

733
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:47,960
because of whom he couldn't get married.

734
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,160
Madhu, I told you not
to get into this business.

735
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,040
Today, they entered your office.

736
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,920
Tomorrow, they could enter my parlour.

737
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,040
It is very dangerous for my girls.

738
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Yes.

739
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:00,000
Girls, eh?

740
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:02,840
No one below the age of 50 ever
steps inside your parlour.

741
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,560
Yeah, and they leave
looking like 20-year-olds.

742
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,520
That's how skilled I am.
I am a professional.

743
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:08,400
Brother, let's go meet Mr. Kamte.

744
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,440
He's a constable
at Kala Choki police station.

745
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,320
Let's file a police complaint.

746
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,920
We cannot file a police complaint, Mom!

747
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,320
- We can't.
- Why not?

748
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,840
Police will come here and
start questioning me instead.

749
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,440
"Why do you have these
photographs and negatives?"

750
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,120
"What are you doing?
Why are you doing this?"

751
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,120
"Do you have a licence?"

752
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,920
What will I tell them?

753
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,200
Oh good god, you don't have a licence?

754
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:28,520
It's considered illegal
if you don't take permission.

755
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,760
Like you have.

756
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,840
What?

757
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,840
The permission to run a beauty parlour?

758
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,640
Well...

759
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,920
But I don't ruin people's
life like you do.

760
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,480
I make them beautiful.

761
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,040
- He wants permission!
- Beautiful, hmm?

762
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,600
- You make them beautiful?
- Yes, I do.

763
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,960
Dogs bark at the women
who leave this parlour.

764
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,040
The dogs that you let loose on them!

765
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,440
- Mom!
- The dogs that I let loose on them?

766
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,720
Dada! What is this?

767
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,160
Stop fighting like cats and dogs.

768
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,120
- Tell him.
- She started it.

769
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,120
Madhu!

770
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,960
What? What happened?
Why are you yelling?

771
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,640
What do we do now?

772
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,640
Kaka,

773
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,160
now we rain on his parade.

774
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,760
Dammit!

775
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,560
You'll certainly rot in hell.

776
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:22,320
You'll be doomed.
It's all ruined.

777
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,360
What happened, dad?

778
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,200
Have a look.

779
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,320
Such a hideous crime.

780
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,200
Someone added water in
all our stock of milk and butter.

781
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,360
Who must have done it?

782
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,720
Changamal's Dairy!

783
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,560
He is jealous of us.

784
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,360
I won't spare him.

785
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,000
I'll butcher him.

786
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,400
- Bless me, uncle...
- Step aside.

787
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,840
Changamal did this?

788
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:44,800
Don't be an idiot.

789
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,520
I know who's responsible for it.

790
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,440
Who?

791
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,400
We broke into his office,
so he infiltrated our dairy.

792
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,400
The wedding detective?

793
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,440
Priest was right.

794
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,840
He is indeed dangerous.

795
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,400
I wonder how many lives
he has ruined so far.

796
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,480
Look at this.

797
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,720
He clicked so many pictures of you.

798
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,760
Here.

799
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:03,760
Hell...

800
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,920
Is he a ghost or what?

801
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,000
We didn't even realise when
he followed us and clicked them.

802
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,040
I also developed a picture
of his family by mistake.

803
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,240
So that's Madhu Mangal Rane.

804
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,240
Yes.

805
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,000
He ruined your life
as well as your business.

806
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,800
Only those who don't know how
to make cheese, cry over spilt milk.

807
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,560
I'll ruin his life as I mend mine.

808
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,080
I'll have him dancing
to my tunes in no time.

809
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,400
Awesome!

810
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,680
That's enough, it's just for me
and not the whole city.

811
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,080
Cheers, bro.

812
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,680
She is here... let's go!

813
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,680
Leave the tea, Sukhi.

814
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,280
We'll pay you later.

815
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,840
You don't need these products.

816
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,480
Oh, a skin so radiant and smooth,
I wish it could be bottled.

817
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,120
This is Suraj.

818
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,600
Will you be the light of my life?

819
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,760
Yes.

820
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,160
Really, you will?

821
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,160
Eh excuse me, mister?

822
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,320
Sir, what do you want?

823
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,800
Your Highness...
what can I do for you?

824
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,600
Huh?

825
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,040
What do you want?

826
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,400
That blue box.

827
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:03,640
That?

828
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,640
Yes, that one.

829
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,600
Huh?

830
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,880
Yes, right.

831
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,120
For my mom.

832
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,200
She loves to be a woman.

833
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,200
I mean she loves using these things.

834
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,120
Which one? Which one? Which one?

835
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,560
Should I take the purple one?

836
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,600
Or the red one? Perhaps the green one?

837
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,240
There are so many of them,
it's hard to choose one.

838
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,480
Can you... help me?

839
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,440
I have never used these things,

840
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,400
so I don't know which one to pick.

841
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,880
How does your mother look like?

842
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,480
Don't all mothers look beautiful?

843
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,160
Hmm?

844
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,560
That is true.

845
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,640
What's her complexion like?

846
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,600
Dark, fair?

847
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:51,000
Her complexion?
A shade or two lighter than dark.

848
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,640
So, close to dark.

849
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,560
I've taken after my dad.

850
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,480
Hmm, so these might
look good on your mother.

851
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,800
- All three of them?
- Hmm.

852
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,200
They are to be used together?

853
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,760
Oh, one by one.

854
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,360
Pack these, please.

855
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,720
This is the first time someone
has brought lipsticks for his mother.

856
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,400
Does she need anything else?

857
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,080
Perhaps an eyeliner,
a mascara or a nail polish?

858
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,880
I have a variety of products.

859
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,080
She's my mother, not a model.

860
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,240
Can I have my things?

861
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,480
Here you go.

862
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,920
Bye.

863
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,760
That will be 250, sir.

864
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,360
Sir? 250 for these.

865
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,760
I don't want them.

866
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:38,400
You can have them for 200!

867
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,480
What's wrong?

868
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:46,200
I guess I ran out of gas.

869
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,880
No, I doubt that.

870
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,360
it goes something like
this when it runs out of gas.

871
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,560
I think your clutch came apart.

872
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,920
I mean your moped's.

873
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:55,760
Oh, I see.

874
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,200
And you know that just by looking at it?

875
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:01,920
I just need to look into
a person's eyes to know,

876
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,040
whether the calculus is
inside or outside the gallbladder.

877
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,320
Really?

878
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,640
Really.

879
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,640
Mechanic!

880
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:12,200
I can fix a motor on a cycle
and make it a motorcycle.

881
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,200
What's wrong, madam?

882
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:14,960
It won't start?
Can I have a look?

883
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,920
The clutch's gone.

884
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,360
I told you so.
It's the clutch.

885
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,800
Tomorrow, we'll...

886
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,600
I mean, I'll have it repaired by tomorrow.

887
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,560
Just give me your address.

888
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,040
He knows me.

889
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:30,160
You can let me know where you stay.

890
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,280
But I don't even know who you are.

891
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,440
Me? I am Suraj Singh Dhillon.

892
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,080
And you are?

893
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,840
Tulsi Rane.

894
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,680
Tulsi.

895
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:42,960
Not Tulsi, Tulsi.

896
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,720
- Tulsi.
- Rane.

897
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,040
Rane works for me.

898
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,560
Ms. Rane, let me drop you on my motorbike.

899
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,040
Sounds good. We'll have your moped
delivered by tomorrow.

900
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,520
You don't need to hold me,
you can hold on to the motorbike.

901
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,960
And I assure you I'll not hit the brakes.

902
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:56,600
Promise?

903
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:57,520
I swear on my mom.

904
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,360
I won't even hit the brakes
to stop at a signal.

905
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,360
Trust him.
He's a nice man. Go with him.

906
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,760
We'll have it delivered tomorrow.

907
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,280
- Shall we?
- Yes.

908
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,480
Thank you,
for helping me.

909
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,480
You are most welcome.

910
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,640
I'll call tomorrow and return your moped.

911
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,320
- Thank you.
- No problem.

912
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,160
Excuse me?

913
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:28,080
Can I have your phone number?

914
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,760
Just so it gets easier to make that call?

915
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,440
You see, we are yet
to develop telepathy between us.

916
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,040
Mom, here are the things
that you'd asked for.

917
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:42,760
What?

918
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,600
"Oh, it'll be a magnificent sight."

919
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,760
"This brother will gleam with pride,"

920
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,440
"My sister's soon going to be a bride!"

921
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,560
- "My sister's soon going to be a bride!"
- Will anyone tell me what is going on?

922
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,720
We have two marriage proposals for you.

923
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,360
Remember the pictures he had shown,

924
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,440
of the railway ticket checker
and the municipality officer?

925
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:03,360
Both of them went crazy
after they looked at your picture.

926
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,600
- Indeed crazy.
- What does that mean?

927
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,600
Well, I had gone to meet both of them.

928
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,040
The ticket checker called me,

929
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,960
and said that his family would like
to come meet you this Tuesday.

930
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:13,520
You're getting a proposal
from government servant!

931
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,360
I'd suggest that you accept it.

932
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:19,680
Very few girls get such
an opportunity, my child.

933
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,360
Very few.

934
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,040
He'll get a pension.

935
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,520
Plus, lifelong free travel in railways.

936
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,800
- Oh.
- Perfect.

937
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,080
Moreover, he has a fair complexion.

938
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,720
He's fair and handsome.

939
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,920
Mom?

940
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,600
Though illiterate,
she has a fair complexion, Mr. Dhillon.

941
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,320
Good that she isn't educated,

942
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,080
she won't make a fuss
about doing the chores.

943
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,880
Son, only fortunate ones get
to marry illiterate girls these days.

944
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,320
Then why don't you
pull Guddi out of school?

945
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,640
- Hey!
- Why are you educating her?

946
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,520
We too will have an
illiterate girl at home then.

947
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,840
Not so soon, I just brought
a new school bag and sandals.

948
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,080
That'll have to wait.

949
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,120
I was talking about the daughters-in-law,
not daughters.

950
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,280
Here's your tea.

951
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,040
So do we set a date, Mr. Dhillon?

952
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,480
"All we get is dates after dates!"

953
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,840
"What we are not getting
is justice, uncle!"

954
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,640
And what justice do you seek, huh?

955
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,880
He's not getting
the kind of girl he wants.

956
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:07,840
Shut up.

957
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,560
You and that "bro" of yours.

958
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,880
The way you two have disgraced us!

959
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,560
- I don't want your another word about this.
- You put this on.

960
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,720
Got it?

961
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,040
I am going to Amritsar
to meet the girl's family.

962
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:23,400
Everyone better get this straight,

963
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,720
I get the last word in this family.

964
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,000
Er, I mean, we do.

965
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,880
How can I marry an illiterate girl?

966
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:38,120
Damn it, I know the difference
between macro and micro economics.

967
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:40,120
I am the first child in this family
to become a graduate.

968
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,480
That too with such good grades.

969
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:45,000
You could have topped
if you'd bribed them some more.

970
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,960
You are the one who made me a bad boy.

971
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,400
I'll end up wasting
my youth with the cattle.

972
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,280
Am I even fated to have
a nice girl in my life?

973
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,120
I think you should make your own fate.

974
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,840
Don't give up.

975
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,080
Be the master of your universe.

976
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:03,200
Be a man.

977
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,400
Be a storm.

978
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,280
Ride the Tiger, Swing the sword.

979
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,240
You are what you wanna be.

980
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,560
Break the shackles
and bring down the walls!

981
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,360
You have the Power! He-Man!

982
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,680
Settle down Orko!

983
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,560
We already have one
He-Man sitting outside.

984
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,280
Stop hanging around Bollywood heroes
houses on sundays. It makes you delusional.

985
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,360
Tell me, what should we do next?

986
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,000
Well, the moped's been repaired.

987
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,240
Hello?

988
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,240
Hello, Tulsi?

989
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,560
It's Suraj.

990
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,400
Oh, the rich milkman.

991
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,360
Yes, the very rich milkman.

992
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,360
I called to say that
your moped's been repaired.

993
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,720
Fine, ask the mechanic to deliver it
and collect the payment.

994
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,640
No, that mechanic has
already handed it over to me.

995
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,600
Now I'll have to come and deliver it.

996
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,200
Do you get a commission from him?

997
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,240
Na, what commission can
I possible make from this?

998
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,080
Just means to an end,
you get your moped, I get you.

999
00:48:59,200 --> 00:48:59,800
Huh?

1000
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,240
Nothing. I mean,
I needed to talk to you.

1001
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,600
What about? Tell me.

1002
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,600
If I say that now, what'd I say
to you tomorrow when we meet?

1003
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,560
Can we meet tomorrow at noon?

1004
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,960
I'll return your moped,
then we can catch a movie.

1005
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,440
I don't like to watch movies.

1006
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,080
Really?
I don't either.

1007
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,880
So, what do you like to watch?
We'll watch that.

1008
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,760
Name the place and time.

1009
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,800
We'll see whatever you wish to see.

1010
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:28,800
'Draupadi Ne Keli Kaashi'
(Draupadi visited Kashi).

1011
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,160
So you like Marathi plays?

1012
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,160
Yes. They are the best.

1013
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:34,120
I watch all of them.

1014
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:34,840
Okay.

1015
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,280
You know,
everyone in my family loves drama.

1016
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:38,920
I can see that.

1017
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:39,680
What do you mean?

1018
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,800
I mean you have such an art loving family.

1019
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:42,640
True.

1020
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:43,160
Right.

1021
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,120
You don't watch Marathi plays?

1022
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:46,880
No, I watch the milking process.

1023
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,040
That's quite entertaining as well.

1024
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:50,160
- Oh.
- Yes.

1025
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,120
I hope you know Marathi.

1026
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,800
I know a little.

1027
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,000
I know all the Marathi expletives though.

1028
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,920
When did you shift to Mumbai?

1029
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,840
I was born here, in Ghatkopar.

1030
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,480
Then you should know Marathi.

1031
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,320
You've been in Mumbai since birth
and you don't know Marathi?

1032
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,720
I know Marathi.

1033
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,720
Educate a woman,
educate a generation.

1034
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,960
Speed breaker ahead.

1035
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,040
Come, come money...

1036
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,680
Hail Shivaji, Hail Maharashtra.

1037
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:16,840
Very good.

1038
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:18,920
All our communication
will be in Marathi henceforth.

1039
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,240
- Sure.
- Let's have tea.

1040
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,760
It's okay!

1041
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,160
I meant Let's have tea.

1042
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,800
- It's okay!
- Right, whatever.

1043
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:30,720
Duryodhan has captured our land
by our counterfeit signatures.

1044
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,880
Take your land back by calling a war.

1045
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,960
- War?
- Brother.

1046
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:35,880
No... no...

1047
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,120
Not that war.

1048
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,200
Then what?

1049
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:40,800
War over here.

1050
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,240
Chess!

1051
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:43,240
Chess!

1052
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:44,600
Hey.

1053
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,120
King, the game begins.

1054
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,760
Very nice, very nice.

1055
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:51,920
Very good.

1056
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,360
Uncle Shakuni...

1057
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,680
...grabbed them in his hands.

1058
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,200
I mean the dice.

1059
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,760
And now... uncle is squeezing them.

1060
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,400
You were looking for me in the palace.

1061
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,160
But I was exercising in the garden.

1062
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,000
Too good, man.
Amazing.

1063
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,640
Very nice.

1064
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,480
Draupadi, we are hundred.

1065
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,920
Leave me, Duryodhana.

1066
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,760
I said leave me.

1067
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,040
A woman is getting humiliated
in your royal court, king.

1068
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,720
Is woman a thing for you?

1069
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,480
To bet in the game of gambling?

1070
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,880
Well said, Draupadi. Go for it!

1071
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,440
Speed breaker ahead.

1072
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:46,840
I know Marathi.

1073
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:49,280
I'm enjoying it.
That dude's crazy.

1074
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:55,800
It wasn't me this time.

1075
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,600
I thoroughly enjoyed this.

1076
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:02,840
I've laughed so much
that even my insides hurt.

1077
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,280
How did you like it?

1078
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:05,720
It's my favourite play.

1079
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,000
I've already watched it eight times.

1080
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,040
Oh, so you too didn't get it
in the first time!

1081
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:11,600
Right?

1082
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,000
So, I'll drop you before I head home?

1083
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,760
No, I'm not heading home.

1084
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,880
I teach in a coaching class at night.

1085
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,800
Coaching?

1086
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:22,600
Then I'll take you there.

1087
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:23,400
Let's go.

1088
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,240
What happened?

1089
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,240
My family's getting me married.

1090
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,200
To?

1091
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,600
I don't know, some government servant.

1092
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,160
So I repaired the moped
for someone else to drive?

1093
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:44,880
What?

1094
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,320
No I mean, are you happy with the match?

1095
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:49,520
I don't know.

1096
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,520
That's strange.
You are either happy or you are not.

1097
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,960
It's not something
a doctor can diagnose.

1098
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,720
May I say something?

1099
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:08,400
Getting a girl like you
is like hitting a jackpot.

1100
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,240
You are so beautiful, well cultured.

1101
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,520
An ideal Indian woman.

1102
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,600
Come with me.

1103
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,840
Yeah, let's go and talk to
that government servant right away.

1104
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,800
No, I want you to come with
me so that you know everything about me.

1105
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,600
Then you can decide how ideal I am.

1106
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,640
Good. Sister-in-law. Madam.

1107
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,880
- Yes, let's go.
- Hop on.

1108
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:33,960
The mechanic is going to tag along?

1109
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,240
He's now my best friend.

1110
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,720
Yes, best friends like Aladdin and genie.

1111
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,880
Stop hugging me.

1112
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,040
I know everything, Aladdin and genie!

1113
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,040
- Let's go.
- Let's go!

1114
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,440
She entered a karate class, bro.

1115
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:53,680
Did she call us here to beat us up?

1116
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,720
It's Kokate Classes, not karate classes.

1117
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,400
You know what Kokate Classes is?

1118
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:58,360
What is it?

1119
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,280
Let's go and find out.

1120
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:04,120
The concept of interference
is made clear by ripple tank experiment.

1121
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:04,960
Do you understand?

1122
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,800
- Yes, sir.
- Very nice.

1123
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,760
Hello, sir.

1124
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,120
And she is back.

1125
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,200
Who is she?

1126
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,840
Why does she do this?

1127
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,520
Quiet.

1128
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,200
- Hi, sir.
- Hi.

1129
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:16,800
Bye, sir.

1130
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,680
- Bless me, sir.
- Hey!

1131
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:21,080
Who are they?
What is going on?

1132
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:23,560
Always just walk through my classes.

1133
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,920
This stops now!

1134
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:26,400
Where did she go?

1135
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,240
- Is she a ghost?
- Suraj!

1136
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,600
There she is.

1137
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,720
Hey, she vanished, again.

1138
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,560
Is she playing hide and seek, bro?

1139
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:39,040
- Where has she brought us?
- Bro, that door.

1140
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:40,440
Look at it.

1141
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,600
The door?

1142
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,560
Be careful, man.

1143
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,800
Tulsi?

1144
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,360
Is she a chef?

1145
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,480
Tulsi?

1146
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,440
- She's playing hide and seek.
- Excuse me, have you seen Tulsi?

1147
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,960
What are you making?

1148
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:53,400
I guess she's making a fool out of us.

1149
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,800
- Tulsi?
- Tulsi?

1150
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:57,520
Tulsi?

1151
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:17,640
So for the next song,
I am presenting, my assistant,

1152
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:23,040
the budding first female
DJ of Bombay, DJ Tina!

1153
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,480
Hello people!

1154
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:59,600
Welcome to Water!

1155
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,760
What just happened?
Is she the same girl?

1156
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,400
Does her brother know about this?

1157
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:04,520
I doubt it.

1158
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,280
She smuggled us in like illegal drugs.

1159
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:09,480
Take that Madhu Mangal Rane!

1160
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:12,960
You get other people's secrets out while
your sister hides the biggest one from you.

1161
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,760
This is awesome, bro.

1162
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,440
You're holding Undertaker's trump card,

1163
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,760
the one with 7 feet height.

1164
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:19,600
What do you mean?

1165
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,440
Madhu Mangal Rane will certainly lose
face if we let this cat out of the bag.

1166
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,880
Tulsi's marriage will also get called off.

1167
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,120
Then she'll be all yours.

1168
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,400
You can marry her
and seek your revenge as well.

1169
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,640
Stop hugging me.

1170
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:35,000
So I get to drink the
milk and make cheese too?

1171
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:35,920
Right.

1172
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,800
But Sukhi, if Tulsi finds out,

1173
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,760
it will break her heart
along with her other vital parts.

1174
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,960
Don't you think you are exaggerating?

1175
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,760
It will break her heart for sure.

1176
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,560
Don't underestimate me, bro.

1177
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:47,880
I have an idea.

1178
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:48,640
Hmm?

1179
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,200
Yes.

1180
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,080
You...

1181
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,200
Thanks to our rocking DJ Chetan
for giving me this opportunity.

1182
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:03,880
I don't know whether I'll
get to be the first female DJ or not,

1183
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,640
because the chances are,
I'll be married before that ever happens.

1184
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:07,840
Oh.

1185
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,160
Then you'll find me doing
dishes instead of spinning discs.

1186
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:12,920
I'll still have a mixer under my control,

1187
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,560
but it will be used to
mix veggies and not the songs.

1188
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,120
I'll have to do all
those household chores.

1189
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,440
And if I don't do them,
they'll call me a drama queen.

1190
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,840
Well, I am what I am!

1191
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:35,840
Done.

1192
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,160
No, keep a chair there.

1193
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,000
Which chair...

1194
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,880
Oh... my angel!

1195
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,640
You look so beautiful.

1196
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,120
You look amazing.

1197
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:47,880
Wait.

1198
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,600
There.

1199
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,520
Mom...

1200
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,520
she has certainly not taken after you.

1201
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:55,640
You dirty dog.

1202
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,760
When are they expected, huh?

1203
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,760
And his highness finally
blesses us with his presence.

1204
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:00,720
Why so late, Kaka?

1205
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,400
Bedekar was making fresh
onion fritters so I decided to wait.

1206
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:05,600
Here you go.

1207
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:07,360
Thums up.

1208
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,440
Served chill.

1209
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,680
Hello?

1210
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:12,680
Hello, Mr. Rane?

1211
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:13,960
M. M. Rane.

1212
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,160
This is Prakash speaking.

1213
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,480
What's wrong? You guys are running late?

1214
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:19,520
No, we will not be coming anymore.

1215
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:21,960
No? Why?

1216
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:25,160
Mr. Rane, you said your sister
teaches at Kokate Coaching Classes.

1217
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:27,160
She's an ideal Indian woman.

1218
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,880
That she is.

1219
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:31,560
Which newspaper do you read?

1220
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,480
Samna.

1221
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:33,760
You should check out Jaibharat.

1222
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,840
Fix things at your home
before finding fault in others.

1223
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,680
Understood me?

1224
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:45,640
Mrs. Mishra?

1225
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,120
Yes, brother?

1226
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,000
Do you have a copy of Jaibharat?

1227
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,600
Yes, it must be inside. Help yourself.

1228
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,800
What the hell is this?

1229
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:55,760
What is it?

1230
01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:01,080
Will Girgaon's Tulsi Rane
be India's first female DJ?

1231
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:02,160
DJ?

1232
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,680
What are you wearing?

1233
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:05,960
Since when have you been into this?

1234
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,320
Mom, do you plan to read the whole thing?

1235
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,240
No, it also has a picture
we'd clicked in Kashmir.

1236
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:11,280
You should be questioning her!

1237
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,600
Ask her if she's done
something inappropriate.

1238
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,200
What is this, girl?

1239
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,280
Why didn't you tell us?

1240
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,880
What did you tell me
about her late nights?

1241
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,440
She takes extra classes.

1242
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:26,640
Extra classes, my foot!

1243
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:28,960
I shouldn't have trusted you.

1244
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:33,320
Madhu Mangal Rane
who spies on the world,

1245
01:02:33,560 --> 01:02:37,680
failed to catch his own sister's lie.

1246
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,920
I am so stupid!

1247
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:42,080
What's going on?

1248
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,240
Nothing, go home.

1249
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:44,080
Go.

1250
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:48,720
Mom, didn't you say,
"you can do as you please?"

1251
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,280
Remember the time when people told you,

1252
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:52,680
"It's not right to run a Beauty Parlour."

1253
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:53,520
So?

1254
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,080
You still went ahead with it anyway.

1255
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:55,880
I have also decided...

1256
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:57,920
I want to be a DJ.

1257
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,760
But what does a DJ do?

1258
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:03,400
DJ and a Beauty Parlour
are two different things.

1259
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,200
How?

1260
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:09,800
She wears skimpy clothes
and dances before a crowd at night!

1261
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,040
Stay put, Kaka!

1262
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,680
Dada, I know this isn't about
late nights and skimpy clothes.

1263
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,160
Your ego got hurt,

1264
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,280
because you didn't
even get the wind of it.

1265
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,280
The detective inside you has failed.

1266
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,960
- I haven't failed.
- You have!

1267
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,360
I am hurt...

1268
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,040
I am angry...

1269
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,320
...And you are a failure!

1270
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,600
Accept it Madhu.

1271
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,600
People will laugh at you.

1272
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,680
They will despise you, my boy.

1273
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:41,720
The rascal's gonna kill me.

1274
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,400
Hey!

1275
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,760
What are you doing?

1276
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,200
Are you crazy trying
to scare a priest?

1277
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,200
You'll go to hell.

1278
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,520
I'll go to hell, huh?

1279
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:55,880
You keep scaring the world
with all the possible planets!

1280
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,920
How can you even call yourself a priest!

1281
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,840
Hold on for a second.

1282
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,520
Keep that down before anyone sees it.

1283
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:05,560
So tell me, who asked you to
print that article about my sister?

1284
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,880
No one. I did it on my own.

1285
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:09,360
You did it on my own, huh?

1286
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,240
You won't even utter God's name
if there is no monetary gain,

1287
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,960
and you would print
an article free of cost?

1288
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:18,040
I swear.

1289
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:19,040
Tell me!

1290
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:21,240
Tell me!

1291
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:23,480
Suraj Dhillon.

1292
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,640
What?

1293
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:28,200
Suraj Dhillon.

1294
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,400
He gave me her picture
and told me about it.

1295
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,920
That milkman?

1296
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:33,680
Yes.

1297
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,360
The one who runs a stable of buffaloes?

1298
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,560
Yes.

1299
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,440
He was following my sister?

1300
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:44,840
Come on, call him up.

1301
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,280
Hang on!

1302
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:50,080
Hello?

1303
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,480
Jai Matarani Doodh Bhandar.

1304
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:53,880
Hello, Mr. Suraj Dhillon.

1305
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:55,560
Hi, who is this?

1306
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:01,040
You don't even recognise
my voice, milkman?

1307
01:06:01,240 --> 01:06:03,120
You think you are Bill Clinton
that I'd recognise your voice!

1308
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:04,240
Who the hell are you?

1309
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:07,200
I am Madhu Mangal Rane.

1310
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:10,760
Oh... the great spy!

1311
01:06:11,480 --> 01:06:12,880
How are you, sir?
How is it going?

1312
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,880
You sound upset.

1313
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:15,200
I hope everything is fine.

1314
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,600
You spied on a spy, kiddo.

1315
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:21,040
You broke into my office.

1316
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,080
Then you targeted my family.

1317
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:25,200
Because of you my sister's
marriage was called off.

1318
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:28,160
That's your job, to break marriages.

1319
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,760
I just sell milk,
I am sure you are aware.

1320
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:33,360
So you didn't conspire with Doobey
and pulled that stunt in the newspaper?

1321
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,800
You thought I wouldn't find out?

1322
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,120
I am a detective... not a milkman.

1323
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,320
Then I'm afraid you are not a good one.

1324
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,200
You don't even know what
your sister has been up to.

1325
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,360
Even the nosey neighbourhood
aunties are better informed than you are.

1326
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,400
The game is on, Mr. Suraj Dhillon!

1327
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:58,200
I've already punished
my sister for her mistake.

1328
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,760
I've put a stop to her gig.

1329
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,080
What do you mean?

1330
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,160
You stopped her disco gig?

1331
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,120
Right.

1332
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,640
And it's your turn now.

1333
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,560
Listen, can you swim?

1334
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,080
Yes, I can. Why do you ask?

1335
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,280
I plan to immerse you along
with Lord Ganesha this time.

1336
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,920
What is it, bro? All good?

1337
01:07:27,360 --> 01:07:28,280
You look worried.

1338
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,440
That detective knows
we are responsible for the article.

1339
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,240
What if he tells Tulsi?

1340
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:42,120
It's okay. We did manage
to get our revenge, didn't we?

1341
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:44,880
But I really like her.

1342
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,400
She'll be heartbroken.

1343
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,080
I shouldn't have listened to you.

1344
01:07:58,360 --> 01:07:59,280
Bro?

1345
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:39,320
Hail Lord Ganesha!

1346
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:42,200
Hail Lord Ganesha!

1347
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:43,280
Listen up, everyone.

1348
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,920
Take a seat. Settle down.

1349
01:08:57,000 --> 01:08:57,880
Tulsi?

1350
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,080
Hello.

1351
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:01,160
Suraj?

1352
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,560
This is for you, a small gift.

1353
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,040
Thank you.

1354
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:10,760
You are welcome.

1355
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:16,720
So, I look like an ideal woman, don't I?

1356
01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:18,440
Yes, you do.

1357
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:22,160
They won't let me be DJ anymore.

1358
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,080
So, I am stuck at home.

1359
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,960
Now I am a well cultured homely girl.

1360
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:33,560
I had something to say.

1361
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,200
What?

1362
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,160
I... wanted to apologise.

1363
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:44,840
I am sorry.

1364
01:09:45,760 --> 01:09:47,040
Why are you apologising?

1365
01:09:52,840 --> 01:09:53,680
Wait a second.

1366
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:58,560
The picture in the newspaper
is of the same day you were at the club.

1367
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:03,000
You are behind this, Suraj?

1368
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:03,920
But why?

1369
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,160
Let me start from the beginning.

1370
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,160
Your brother was responsible
for my marriage being called off.

1371
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:10,280
So, I raided his office to seek revenge.

1372
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,120
That's where we first met.

1373
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,840
At first sight,
under the torch's bright light...

1374
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,520
I fell in love with you.

1375
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:24,400
Then I started following you,
we started talking...

1376
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,120
You ended up taking me to the disco.

1377
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,680
I discreetly clicked
a picture of yours in the disco.

1378
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,320
I thought if I get it published,

1379
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,200
it'd teach your brother a lesson,

1380
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:37,120
scare away that government servant,

1381
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,600
and then we can be together.

1382
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,400
Well played!

1383
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,320
So you took revenge from my
brother and ruined my career as well.

1384
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,160
No, I didn't want to ruin your career.

1385
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:51,160
And now you want me to
forgive you and marry you?

1386
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:53,720
You are so smart.

1387
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:54,200
Huh?

1388
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:56,360
You know in spite of all that happened,

1389
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:59,000
there was one thing that
was keeping me together,

1390
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,800
the fact that there is
someone who understands me,

1391
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,920
someone whom I can share everything with,

1392
01:11:04,720 --> 01:11:06,520
and a slight possibility
of a future together.

1393
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:12,720
But I didn't know
that you'd be so selfish.

1394
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,080
You and my brother are just the same.

1395
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:17,520
Both of you don't care
about anyone's emotions.

1396
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:19,440
Go to hell!

1397
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,040
I love you, a lot.

1398
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,000
I even learnt Marathi for you.

1399
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,480
Well, I'm still learning.

1400
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,480
Please forgive me.

1401
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,560
Who's dead?

1402
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:49,120
Bro.

1403
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,840
They want you outside.

1404
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:52,600
Make it quick.

1405
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:53,600
I am not coming.

1406
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:59,560
So will anyone tell me,
why were my sweet dreams ruined?

1407
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:00,760
Bro is here.

1408
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,120
It's my house. Of course, I'll be here.

1409
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,560
- He is here.
- Bro...

1410
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:05,080
Sukhi, man, you've got to stop hugging me.

1411
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,040
Bro...

1412
01:17:06,120 --> 01:17:07,240
What happened, mom?

1413
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,360
Happiness happened!

1414
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:10,160
What is it?

1415
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:11,680
Why is the entire family so emotional?

1416
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,760
Son, he's here with a marriage
proposal of his sister,

1417
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:16,040
- for you.
- Huh?

1418
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:19,600
- Yes.
- Hey brother-in-law... Surprise!

1419
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:24,600
Oh, the look at his face.

1420
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,240
Like a cat on a hot tin roof.

1421
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,520
You!... I'll show you what
a cat on a hot tin roof feels like.

1422
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,400
- He's a guest son!
- Dad, you don't know, he is no guest.

1423
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,160
He thought his family
would never find out.

1424
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:34,800
- What won't they find out?
- We know, we know.

1425
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,840
What do you know, dad?

1426
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,320
Come on, have a seat.
Look at this.

1427
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:39,080
- We know, son.
- And what do you know?

1428
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:40,960
That you like this girl.

1429
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:45,200
It's not easy to find such well
cultured and beautiful girls nowadays.

1430
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:49,320
Moreover, he said, she's a music maestro.

1431
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,640
She teaches music to young
adults at the Music &amp; Dance academy.

1432
01:17:52,720 --> 01:17:53,760
Did I get that right?

1433
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:55,240
Yes, you are absolutely right.

1434
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:55,960
Right.

1435
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:57,920
We couldn't get any luckier.

1436
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,200
We'll be blessed with
Goddess Saraswati's presence.

1437
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,760
Only fortunate ones get to
marry well-educated girls these days.

1438
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:05,120
- Hypocrite!
- Huh?

1439
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,120
I saw them walking
hand-in-hand at Marine Drive.

1440
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:10,760
- Really?
- We weren't, mom.

1441
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:12,320
They went to Shivaji Park as well.

1442
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:13,720
We didn't, dad. I swear, we didn't.

1443
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,200
They even played video games together.

1444
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,200
No, we didn't.

1445
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:18,560
And I certainly didn't do this.

1446
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:19,480
It's okay, son.

1447
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:21,120
- It's cool.
- It's natural. It happens.

1448
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,800
- Uncle, that's what you call modern love.
- I know.

1449
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:26,160
- Had you have ever done that?
- Never.

1450
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,320
I only got to romance Yashodha
after my parents passed away,

1451
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:31,640
and we were able to get some privacy.

1452
01:18:31,720 --> 01:18:34,680
Before that, it was just a marriage for
marriage sake.

1453
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,080
When did they pass away?

1454
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,480
Just two years back.

1455
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:39,360
So what if it's just been two years?

1456
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,960
- No, I'm...
- So what?

1457
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,920
I must say, your son's way ahead of you.

1458
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,760
Aunty, I think you should meet the girl.

1459
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:47,040
Right.

1460
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:50,000
Then find a suitable,
auspicious day and get them married.

1461
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:50,640
Right.

1462
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:51,560
What are you waiting for?

1463
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:52,400
Go, get the priest on line.

1464
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:53,400
- The priest?
- Go on.

1465
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,200
- Oh yes, the priest.
- Yes.

1466
01:18:55,600 --> 01:18:56,440
Right.

1467
01:18:58,640 --> 01:18:59,600
What's this nonsense?

1468
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:00,480
Hmm?

1469
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:01,080
Nothing.

1470
01:19:01,160 --> 01:19:03,520
I just brought a marriage
proposal of my sister for you.

1471
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,560
I am the one responsible for
your previous one being called off.

1472
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:08,040
So now, it's my responsibility
to get you married,

1473
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:09,360
to my sister.

1474
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:12,520
You love my sister,

1475
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:14,200
don't you now, brother-in-law?

1476
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:15,640
Hey, he's not saying anything.

1477
01:19:15,720 --> 01:19:16,600
He's feeling shy.

1478
01:19:16,680 --> 01:19:17,920
I am not feeling shy, mom.

1479
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:18,800
He's shy.

1480
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:19,800
He has taken after me.

1481
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,080
- Huh?
- Good for him.

1482
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:23,720
He'd be shameless if
he'd taken after his father.

1483
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:24,600
- What did you say?
- Hey, hey, hey!

1484
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,000
What did you just say?

1485
01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:27,200
Calm down, son.

1486
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:30,080
We accept the marriage proposal.

1487
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:31,040
Oh, uncle!

1488
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,600
Sweets, to celebrate the occasion.

1489
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:38,760
Take it, son.

1490
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:45,880
Suraj said, "I'll only marry Tulshi
or I'll forever stay single."

1491
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,320
Just like him.

1492
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,080
He was elated.

1493
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,560
His family too.

1494
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:54,360
He was crying on my shoulder.

1495
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,000
Not that one, this one.

1496
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:57,280
He was literally in tears.

1497
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:01,440
He said, "Dada, you have made my life."

1498
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,480
"I'd never find a girl
better than Tulshi."

1499
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,320
You're being honest?

1500
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:06,840
Of course.

1501
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,160
Dada, you made it clear to his family
that I wish to become a DJ?

1502
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:10,880
Right?

1503
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:12,320
Of course.

1504
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:13,920
His family was even more pleased.

1505
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,160
You know what they said?

1506
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,680
"We'll be blessed with
Goddess Saraswati."

1507
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,000
"DJ Saraswati."

1508
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:24,040
Madhu, are you honestly
being honest here, huh?

1509
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,640
Aren't you happy,

1510
01:20:25,720 --> 01:20:27,240
that your daughter is getting married?

1511
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,440
I am but...

1512
01:20:28,720 --> 01:20:32,160
It's happening so suddenly
that I cannot make sense of it.

1513
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,880
Mom, this is how good matches are made.

1514
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:36,920
Suddenly.

1515
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:38,240
On the spur of the moment!

1516
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:39,160
He.... The guy up there is

1517
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,600
responsible for the
matches made in heaven.

1518
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:42,120
You'd know that better.

1519
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:44,000
After all, you're responsible
for breaking so many of them.

1520
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,000
Couldn't resist taunting me, could you?

1521
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:51,880
That too on such a joyous occasion.

1522
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:53,680
Sweets are delicious.

1523
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,280
Listen, tell me if you don't like him.

1524
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,040
Just tell me.

1525
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,520
I think I should just go can call it off.

1526
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,560
- No, no, no.
- Stay put.

1527
01:21:00,640 --> 01:21:02,000
No, Dada. Don't call it off.

1528
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:04,960
He seems nice.

1529
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,800
So should I invite his family over?

1530
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,040
Yes, Dada.

1531
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:11,120
Attagirl.

1532
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,400
Take this and offer some to everyone.

1533
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,920
There you go.

1534
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:22,080
Please, have some.

1535
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,920
No, thank you.

1536
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,120
No, I'm good.

1537
01:21:25,200 --> 01:21:26,040
I said I am good.

1538
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,720
I'd like to match their horoscopes first.

1539
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:28,440
Okay.

1540
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:31,760
I'd like to suggest that
you should reconsider this match

1541
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,200
if their horoscopes don't match.

1542
01:21:35,120 --> 01:21:36,400
That's why we have brought you along.

1543
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:37,600
Right.

1544
01:21:37,680 --> 01:21:38,760
Here you go.

1545
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:39,960
So, this is the girl's horoscope?

1546
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,240
Hmm.

1547
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,280
Sir, what's taking so long,
it's a horoscope, not a Picasso.

1548
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:06,480
So, do their horoscopes match?

1549
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,040
Madhu just got it made.

1550
01:22:09,120 --> 01:22:09,440
Okay.

1551
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:10,880
He's got it made from a renowned Pundit.

1552
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,400
What did you say his name was?

1553
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,960
Well mom... er, Pundit Bhimsen Joshi.

1554
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,680
Oh. I think I've heard of him.

1555
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,240
What's taking you so long, sir?
Do their attributes match or not?

1556
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,560
36.

1557
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,480
How many of the 36?

1558
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:27,560
All the 36 attributes match, ma'am.

1559
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:28,680
That's wonderful!

1560
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,560
You've never scored that much
even in mathematics.

1561
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:31,520
Yeah, I haven't.

1562
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,200
It's a match made in heaven.

1563
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:37,320
Wonderful.

1564
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,040
- What happened?
- What's wrong?

1565
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:39,800
- I'll go help.
- Yes, mom...

1566
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,280
- Tulshi?
- Mom, stay, I'll handle it.

1567
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,400
- So sweet, go.
- Mom, huh?

1568
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,640
36 attributes matched?

1569
01:22:46,720 --> 01:22:47,720
Yes.

1570
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:48,880
The glass broke.

1571
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,080
It's considered auspicious.

1572
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
What are you doing?

1573
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,480
Why so slippery... Butter hands!

1574
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,600
That's how grand it's going to be, son.

1575
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:14,920
It'll be a wedding no one
in Ghatkopar will ever forget.

1576
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:18,320
East or west, Mr. Gurnaam is the best.

1577
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:20,880
I'd suggest...

1578
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,560
Uncle, please have this.

1579
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:24,600
- Mom?
- Hmm?

1580
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:25,560
Mr. Gurnaam?

1581
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:29,360
Uncle, I suggest you throw a grand
party for their engagement as well.

1582
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:30,360
Okay.

1583
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:33,760
Everyone will get a glimpse
of Gurnaam Dhillon's magnanimity.

1584
01:23:33,840 --> 01:23:37,840
It'll be a great promotion for
your milk business as well.

1585
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,320
Date?

1586
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:41,680
Find an auspicious day and fix the date!

1587
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:44,000
All their attributes match, Mr. Dhillon.

1588
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:45,040
Any and every day is
an auspicious day for them.

1589
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,960
Just place your finger on
the calendar with your eyes closed.

1590
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,400
What ever date your finger lands on,
will be auspicious.

1591
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:51,200
Oh sir... you are so smart!

1592
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:52,840
Fine, then, let's not delay it.

1593
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:53,720
Let's do it this week itself.

1594
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,920
How about Sunday?

1595
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:55,760
- Sunday?
- Yes.

1596
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:56,680
Sunday's perfect.

1597
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,600
It's his birthday on Sunday.

1598
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:00,080
Yes, it's his birthday.

1599
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,360
Yes, my birthday's on Sunday.

1600
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,720
That's great. Simply amazing.

1601
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:07,520
We will arrange for a cake,
engagement ring,

1602
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:09,480
and handcuffs on the same day.

1603
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:10,840
Handcuffs!

1604
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:11,920
Handcuffs?

1605
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:17,160
Mr. Gurnaam,
he's about to get shackled for life.

1606
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,800
Oh right, shackled!

1607
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,720
Have this.

1608
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:27,480
You are so naughty.

1609
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:46,680
Who is it?

1610
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:49,720
Oh son, it's you.

1611
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,080
You scared me.

1612
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:51,720
When did you come in?

1613
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:54,000
Uncle, I am omnipresent.

1614
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,480
Stay blessed.

1615
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,520
Have a seat.

1616
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,880
That's a great invite, uncle.

1617
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:01,200
Hmm?

1618
01:25:02,440 --> 01:25:04,440
Suraj's not home?

1619
01:25:04,520 --> 01:25:07,400
- No, he's gone to meet the catering guy.
- Okay.

1620
01:25:07,480 --> 01:25:09,640
- Then he'll drop by at your place.
- Okay.

1621
01:25:09,720 --> 01:25:11,120
He's over the moon.

1622
01:25:11,200 --> 01:25:13,040
Marriage excitement, huh.

1623
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:18,240
Time flies, doesn't it, uncle. They'll
be engaged by the end of this week.

1624
01:25:18,320 --> 01:25:20,600
And married by next month.

1625
01:25:21,400 --> 01:25:28,800
I thought I'd come here,
meet you and discuss the "give and take".

1626
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,680
Let's be frank here, uncle.
I know the duties of a bride's family.

1627
01:25:30,760 --> 01:25:31,760
So tell me, what are your dowry demands?

1628
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,560
No, no, no, son.

1629
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,680
Don't even utter that word.

1630
01:25:36,280 --> 01:25:38,480
We have everything with the grace of God.

1631
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,840
We are fortunate to find such a nice girl,
such a nice family.

1632
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,000
What else could we possibly want?

1633
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,200
Son, we cannot take dowry.

1634
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:49,200
Our Gurus have strictly forbidden us to.

1635
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,400
I hope you'll understand,
I am her brother.

1636
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:58,040
It's obvious I'd seek some guarantee
that she's going into a well to do family.

1637
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,640
I can understand.

1638
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,760
We have a car, a bungalow, bank balance,
and a large estate in the village.

1639
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:09,040
How much wealth does Suraj have, uncle?

1640
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,720
Just enquiring for my sister's sake.

1641
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:17,160
One million cash and gold worth 500,000.

1642
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,360
How much?

1643
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,400
One million cash and gold worth 500,000.

1644
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:24,040
Oh, perfect.

1645
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,040
No, I can see that
you have everything here.

1646
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,600
If there's anything that you don't have,
I can send it over.

1647
01:26:30,680 --> 01:26:32,400
Stop being childish.

1648
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,920
Dinning table,
sofa set, coloured television,

1649
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,280
refrigerator,
air conditioner, washing machine...

1650
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,120
Oh uncle...

1651
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,280
- Bone china dinner set...
- Enough, I get your point.

1652
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:44,400
Then don't say such embarrassing stuff.

1653
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,760
And what about groceries?
I could order some from the grocer...

1654
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:48,840
100 kilos!

1655
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:50,240
Excuse me?

1656
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:54,760
100 kilos of wheat,
pearl millet, sorghum and pure butter.

1657
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,480
We don't use refined oil.

1658
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,960
You don't use oil at all?

1659
01:26:58,040 --> 01:26:58,600
Come on, man.

1660
01:26:58,680 --> 01:26:59,240
Oh.

1661
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,840
It's good to know that Tulshi
will be well taken care of here.

1662
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:06,840
I'll get going now.

1663
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:07,960
Want to have my milk before you leave?

1664
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:08,440
Excuse me?

1665
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:10,840
How about some fresh
dairy milk or buttermilk?

1666
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:12,040
No, thanks. I am lactose intolerant.

1667
01:27:12,120 --> 01:27:12,640
Okay.

1668
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:13,400
See you.

1669
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:14,720
It's okay, son.

1670
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:16,680
Son, you forgot your bag?

1671
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,440
Oh...

1672
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:24,280
Uncle, please give my high five to Suraj.

1673
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:25,400
Huh?

1674
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,560
- Hi, DJ.
- Hi.

1675
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:38,240
Awesome. So you've taken
over the old age parlour, eh?

1676
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:40,160
Why, all the aunties
got fed up of your mom?

1677
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:43,040
So, this is what you tell him about me?

1678
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,400
- I seek your blessings, mom.
- Bless you.

1679
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,720
- Mom, I didn't tell him anything.
- Hmm.

1680
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:47,040
- He's joking.
- Liar.

1681
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:49,760
Why don't you take a seat, son?

1682
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,840
She'll be done with the facial soon.

1683
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:52,440
No problem.

1684
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:55,560
I actually don't need it,
but I anyway get it done sometimes.

1685
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:57,320
You know I couldn't guess
that you are Tulsi's mom

1686
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,520
when I saw you for the first time.

1687
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,960
You looked more like
her elder sister to me.

1688
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:02,560
That's what everyone says.

1689
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:05,520
I look like Tulshi's elder
sister and Madhu's younger sister.

1690
01:28:06,040 --> 01:28:07,400
Mom, you need to get
your eyes checked again,

1691
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:09,000
and buy a new pair of glasses.

1692
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:09,640
Rubbish.

1693
01:28:09,720 --> 01:28:10,880
I do look like your sister.

1694
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,040
You are just jealous.

1695
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,160
Where are you?
Where are your hands?

1696
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,560
I'm done, mom.

1697
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:16,520
- It's done?
- Yes.

1698
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:17,360
That's it?

1699
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,640
Fine.

1700
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:22,800
- So, everything under control son?
- Yes, all good.

1701
01:28:22,920 --> 01:28:24,400
Started preparing for the wedding?

1702
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:25,320
- Yes, in full swing.
- Really?

1703
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:26,200
Yes, everything's being taken care of.

1704
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:28,760
I came here to get your guest count.

1705
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:29,960
Just to ensure that we
don't miss out on anything.

1706
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,240
No, son. Don't worry about it.

1707
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:35,960
Madhu will handle everything.

1708
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:37,000
Okay.

1709
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:38,800
You always taunt him.

1710
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,080
But all this has been
possible only because of Dada.

1711
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:45,280
Yes, mom, I, too, never thought that your
son would change his opinion about me.

1712
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:45,960
Hmm.

1713
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:48,760
Madhu is a nice boy.

1714
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:50,440
The thing is...

1715
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:52,320
Oh son-in-law,
you are the one cleaning my face!

1716
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:53,320
Yes.

1717
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,120
You are quite a pro at this.

1718
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:58,320
Of course, I take
care of all the buffaloes at my stable.

1719
01:28:58,400 --> 01:28:59,320
Huh?

1720
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:01,560
So, what was I talking about?

1721
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:02,600
Madhu.

1722
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:05,760
Yes. Madhu is a nice boy.

1723
01:29:06,720 --> 01:29:08,800
He's just a little stubborn.

1724
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:11,320
And he gets angry at the drop of a hat.

1725
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,320
But he wasn't always like that.

1726
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:15,840
He used to be very calm and composed.

1727
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,680
Then what happened?

1728
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:17,800
A girl happened.

1729
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,080
Her name's Kavya.

1730
01:29:21,040 --> 01:29:22,840
They went to the same college.

1731
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,080
- Okay.
- They loved each other.

1732
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:26,080
They wanted to get married, but couldn't.

1733
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:26,800
Why?

1734
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,960
She was from a different caste.

1735
01:29:30,640 --> 01:29:34,680
Her parents got her married
to a professor, of the same caste.

1736
01:29:34,760 --> 01:29:35,560
Then?

1737
01:29:35,640 --> 01:29:39,080
She couldn't be Mrs. Kavya
Rane so she became Mrs. Kavya Godbole.

1738
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,880
It's after she got married that we learnt
that her husband had strange quirks.

1739
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,680
Huh?

1740
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:46,920
Hmm.

1741
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:50,440
That's when Madhu decided
to get into this business.

1742
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,840
He spies on prospective grooms like crazy.

1743
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:56,120
He says he won't let any
good girl end up with a bad boy.

1744
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:57,960
One more thing,

1745
01:29:58,040 --> 01:30:00,160
never make Madhu angry.

1746
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,640
He goes crazy when he gets angry.

1747
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,400
He acts on impulse
and becomes destructive.

1748
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:06,120
I hope you two don't have
any issues with each other.

1749
01:30:06,200 --> 01:30:06,640
Huh?

1750
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,360
Issues?

1751
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:08,480
No, I don't have any issues with him.

1752
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,720
Cool, then there's nothing to worry about.

1753
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:10,960
No tension.

1754
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:14,560
We don't have any issues, or do we?

1755
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:35,800
Hail Lord Ganesha!

1756
01:30:57,120 --> 01:31:01,400
'I plan bid you farewell you
along with Lord Ganesha this time.'

1757
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,080
I'd never thought that I'd see this day.

1758
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:52,760
Nor had I thought that
you'd be the one for me.

1759
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:55,320
This is all thanks to Dada.

1760
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,400
Huh?

1761
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:57,160
Dada.

1762
01:31:57,240 --> 01:31:58,040
Hmm, Dada.

1763
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:08,920
That's enough.

1764
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:10,360
That's enough of fireworks.

1765
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:12,760
Ladies and Gentlemen,

1766
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:16,040
it is now time to exchange rings.

1767
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,200
So please, give them a...
huge round of applause.

1768
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:24,040
Yeah, yeah.

1769
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:26,200
There you go.

1770
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,720
- Mom?
- Go ahead.

1771
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:32,120
Hey, wait.

1772
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,680
Wait.

1773
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:35,880
Hey, wait.

1774
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:36,720
What's wrong?

1775
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:37,320
Give me just two minutes.

1776
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:38,800
Just two minutes, Kaka.

1777
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:43,600
I want to say something
before they exchange rings.

1778
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:44,960
I think he'll sing a Marathi folk song.

1779
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:48,600
- Bring it on guys!

1780
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:02,680
Over here.

1781
01:33:02,760 --> 01:33:03,600
There's more.

1782
01:33:03,680 --> 01:33:04,000
Madhu?

1783
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:04,960
Get them.

1784
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:07,080
Be careful with that.

1785
01:33:07,480 --> 01:33:10,640
- Son, what was the need to...
- Come on, uncle.

1786
01:33:11,120 --> 01:33:13,880
I brought everything that you'd asked for.

1787
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:14,760
What?

1788
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:15,760
Everything.

1789
01:33:16,240 --> 01:33:19,640
Utensils, pickles,
poppadoms, wheat...

1790
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,040
Yes, wheat too.

1791
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,000
- A mixer grinder, fruits...
- Hey.

1792
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:27,040
And also a washing
machine of the best brand.

1793
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:28,520
Well, I've got almost everything.

1794
01:33:28,600 --> 01:33:30,880
I just need some more time.

1795
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,920
I'll arrange for the
remaining cash somehow.

1796
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:36,440
Mom, I'll even sell our office and
house if needed, but I'll get it arranged.

1797
01:33:36,520 --> 01:33:38,040
What are you saying, Madhu?

1798
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:40,160
What is he talking about, dad?

1799
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,320
What are you saying, son?

1800
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,320
When did I ask for all these things?

1801
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:50,480
Uncle, please don't slander
me in front of so many people.

1802
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,000
I brought all this only
because you asked me to.

1803
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:54,520
Why would I do this otherwise?

1804
01:33:54,760 --> 01:33:56,280
I'll make arrangements
and get the remaining cash.

1805
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:58,080
Please don't call off
the wedding because of that.

1806
01:34:00,680 --> 01:34:01,680
- Dada! - Madhu!
- He's...

1807
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:03,000
What are you doing, Dada?

1808
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:04,520
What is this nonsense?

1809
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:07,680
I had my doubts that you'd
pull some stunt for sure.

1810
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,000
My father never demanded dowry from him.

1811
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:12,200
You were right, bro.

1812
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,240
He is not a good man.

1813
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:14,080
Why are you lying, man?

1814
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:15,080
He's a scoundrel.

1815
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:16,680
He spies on good people.

1816
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,520
Don't act smart, huh, priest!

1817
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:19,680
Whose acting smart, huh?

1818
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,360
You want us to keep quiet
while he keeps accusing us?

1819
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,880
- We never demanded...
- We will...

1820
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,640
- How can you stop us...
- I said that we will...

1821
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:26,560
No, please, don't fight.

1822
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,280
I'll prove it.

1823
01:34:29,880 --> 01:34:31,720
Hey! Come on, play it.

1824
01:34:37,320 --> 01:34:39,400
Time flies, doesn't it, uncle. They'll
be engaged by the end of this week.

1825
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:39,920
Hmm.

1826
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:41,400
They'll be getting married next month.

1827
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:43,280
Let's be frank here, uncle.
I know the duties of a bride's family.

1828
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:44,120
So tell me, what are your dowry demands?

1829
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:45,480
No, no, a large estate in the village,

1830
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:51,000
a car, a bungalow,
One million cash and gold worth 500,000.

1831
01:34:51,080 --> 01:34:51,920
How much?

1832
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,840
One million cash and gold worth 500,000.

1833
01:34:56,920 --> 01:34:59,160
No, I can see that
you have everything here.

1834
01:34:59,240 --> 01:35:00,880
If there's anything that you don't have,
I can send it over.

1835
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:03,280
Dinning table,
sofa set, coloured television,

1836
01:35:03,360 --> 01:35:07,920
refrigerator, air conditioner,
cooler, washing machine, mixer grinder.

1837
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:08,760
What about groceries?

1838
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:13,400
100 kilos of wheat,
pearl millet, sorghum and pure butter.

1839
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:15,240
We don't use refined oil.

1840
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:25,280
- This...
- That's your voice.

1841
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:28,560
Yes, it is.
But that's not how I had said it.

1842
01:35:29,880 --> 01:35:32,080
This... this isn't
the conversation we had.

1843
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:35,280
I had... I meant we already have...

1844
01:35:36,200 --> 01:35:37,400
Son?

1845
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:39,720
Please don't beg him, dad.

1846
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:41,440
Why are you doing this, son?

1847
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:43,040
Hmm?

1848
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,800
You are the one who approached
us with the proposal.

1849
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,600
So why are you creating this scene now?

1850
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:50,240
Suraj,

1851
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:54,720
I cannot believe that you
have such a greedy family.

1852
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:58,400
You call this love?

1853
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:01,240
All the tall claims that
you had made was for this?

1854
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:05,000
You want to quantify a girl's life?
With a bunch of things?

1855
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:08,000
Are you doing me a favour
by marrying me, Suraj?

1856
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:12,520
I... should've never trusted you, again.

1857
01:36:14,200 --> 01:36:15,440
Tulsi, please listen to me.

1858
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,120
- You are disgusting.
- Tulsi.

1859
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:19,480
Let's go.

1860
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:23,920
Tulshi!

1861
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,440
Accepting dowry is a sin,
you know that, right?

1862
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:58,640
It's illegal as well, sir.

1863
01:36:58,720 --> 01:36:59,480
Right.

1864
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,640
We have the proof as well.

1865
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:01,760
Yes, we have proof.

1866
01:37:01,840 --> 01:37:02,240
Right.

1867
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:03,120
- And sir...
- What?

1868
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,160
It's his birthday. Look at this.

1869
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,360
Wonderful.

1870
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:08,320
Sir, happy birthday to you.

1871
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:09,840
Mane?

1872
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:11,240
Yeah, birthday to you.
Birthday to you.

1873
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:12,640
Take the cake along!

1874
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:16,200
You will cut the
cake at the police station, yeah?

1875
01:37:21,120 --> 01:37:22,080
Tulshi...

1876
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:26,440
Kiddo, please,
you've got to stop crying now.

1877
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,200
It's ruining your makeup.

1878
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,640
It's fine if you don't
want to get married.

1879
01:37:30,720 --> 01:37:31,040
Okay?

1880
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,480
Please, just stop crying.
Don't cry, my baby.

1881
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:35,000
I want to get married, mom.

1882
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:35,760
What?

1883
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,840
And I want to get married
on that same day.

1884
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,880
This was the first time I liked someone,

1885
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:46,960
but he turned out to be so pathetic.

1886
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:50,480
Now I want to get married
and prove it to the world

1887
01:37:50,600 --> 01:37:53,560
that a girl can get married
without giving any dowry.

1888
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,040
- Dada?
- Yes.

1889
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,640
- Find me a match.
- Okay.

1890
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:02,360
Now if I get married,
I'll get married on that very day.

1891
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:05,880
But Tulshi,
what about your dream of becoming a DJ?

1892
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:09,200
Mom...
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

1893
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:14,040
You remember that government
servant I'd mentioned?

1894
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:15,640
He's ready to marry her unconditionally.

1895
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:17,360
I'm going to the club.

1896
01:38:18,320 --> 01:38:19,720
Yes, carry on.

1897
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:21,640
Don't worry, I'll handle everything.

1898
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,760
You should fix your makeup
before going to the club.

1899
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,680
- I'll manage, mom.
- I'll fix it

1900
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,400
Let me help, I'm a professional.

1901
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,400
Yes mom, help her.

1902
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:46,240
What?

1903
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:51,520
The boy who messed with
you ended up in prison.

1904
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:58,560
Moreover, you convinced
Tulshi to marry the boy you like.

1905
01:38:59,360 --> 01:39:03,320
That was some trick Madhu!

1906
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,680
Well played, my boy.

1907
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:26,640
Look at what that rascal did to us.

1908
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,960
If curses worked in this era,
I would've given him a deadly one.

1909
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:33,400
I'd turn him into a mosquito
and crush him between my palms.

1910
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,680
It's all over.

1911
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:41,200
All the reputation I had earned
in all these years went down the drain.

1912
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:42,920
Poof, and it was gone.

1913
01:39:43,920 --> 01:39:45,240
What are you saying, dad?

1914
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:48,400
Your reputation isn't a candle that
can be blown out with a single puff.

1915
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,240
Don't worry.
Your reputation is still intact.

1916
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,280
Son, by now, everyone in
the community must have learnt

1917
01:39:54,640 --> 01:39:57,800
that Gurnaam Singh Dhillon demanded dowry.

1918
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:01,200
Now no one will buy milk from our dairy.

1919
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:03,240
Bro?

1920
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Uncle?

1921
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,400
Bless you.

1922
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,240
Our lawyer, Mr. Ravan Mishra.

1923
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,200
Hello?

1924
01:40:14,400 --> 01:40:15,960
Is your name really Ravan?

1925
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:17,000
Yes.

1926
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:20,640
What kind of parents
would name their child Ravan?

1927
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,440
The ones who didn't read
Ramayana!

1928
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,520
Exactly!

1929
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:25,960
Right, right.

1930
01:40:26,440 --> 01:40:27,400
Sign these.

1931
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:28,440
Here.

1932
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:31,360
- Where, sir?
- Here.

1933
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:37,400
Kavya Godbole?

1934
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,160
'Her name's Kavya.'

1935
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,080
'They went to the same college.'

1936
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:42,280
- 'Okay.'
- 'They loved each other.'

1937
01:40:42,400 --> 01:40:44,400
'They wanted to get married,
but couldn't.'

1938
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,720
'Her parents got her married
to a professor, of the same caste.'

1939
01:40:48,920 --> 01:40:49,480
'Then?'

1940
01:40:49,680 --> 01:40:54,720
'She couldn't be Mrs. Kavya
Rane so she became Mrs. Kavya Godbole.'

1941
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:55,840
What is it, bro?

1942
01:40:56,920 --> 01:40:59,720
Madhu's lawyer's name is Kavya?

1943
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,800
Our lawyer is good too.

1944
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,080
Don't be fooled by his name.

1945
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,320
Mr. Ravan,
can you help me with something?

1946
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:05,920
That name doesn't deserve respect, son.

1947
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:06,840
Okay.

1948
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:08,720
Ravan, can you tell me something?

1949
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,560
What?

1950
01:41:09,680 --> 01:41:10,400
Do you know Kavya Godbole?

1951
01:41:10,520 --> 01:41:12,760
Yes, she's a colleague of mine
at the Bombay High Court.

1952
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Is her husband a professor?

1953
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:14,680
Yes.

1954
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:15,880
At Divya College.

1955
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:16,800
Why?

1956
01:41:18,360 --> 01:41:19,400
Nothing. Thank you.

1957
01:41:20,720 --> 01:41:22,320
Take dad home,
I'll catch up with you.

1958
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,000
Okay, bro.

1959
01:41:23,120 --> 01:41:23,960
Dad?
Bless you.

1960
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:26,840
Let's go home, guys.

1961
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:29,200
- Where do you think you are going?
- What are you doing, sir?

1962
01:41:29,320 --> 01:41:30,920
Your name wasn't there
on the bail bond.

1963
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:32,560
But Mr. Dhillon is
just like a family member.

1964
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:33,000
Move it.

1965
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:34,920
Sir, what...!
Mr. Dhillon!

1966
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:36,640
Mr. Dhillon, you've left me behind.

1967
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:37,880
Mr. Dhillon!

1968
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:39,480
Sir, please let me go.

1969
01:41:39,560 --> 01:41:40,520
Stop bugging me, dude.

1970
01:41:42,720 --> 01:41:44,720
Sir, that's Kavya Godbole.

1971
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,200
The one in pink sari.

1972
01:42:29,320 --> 01:42:31,400
Massage! Oil Massage!

1973
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,680
Would you like a massage, sir?

1974
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:33,400
No, thank you.

1975
01:42:33,720 --> 01:42:34,760
It'll get you in the mood.

1976
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:35,760
Not interested, man.

1977
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:38,560
You'll get a full body
massage in just 10 bucks.

1978
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:41,840
Here, out in the open?

1979
01:42:42,040 --> 01:42:44,320
I'm just offering a massage, sir.
How does the location matter?

1980
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:48,040
Fine, if you insist,
give me a foot massage.

1981
01:42:48,160 --> 01:42:49,400
Okay, sir.
Please follow me.

1982
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:49,960
Okay.

1983
01:42:50,600 --> 01:42:51,760
Are there any photographers around?

1984
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:52,520
There are plenty, sir.

1985
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:55,160
This is Marine Drive,
it's swarming with photographers.

1986
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,320
Hey, what... what are you doing?

1987
01:42:58,720 --> 01:42:59,760
At least wait till we get inside.

1988
01:43:02,640 --> 01:43:04,600
This room ends before it begins.

1989
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:06,200
Didn't get a suite this time?

1990
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:07,760
No,

1991
01:43:09,560 --> 01:43:10,680
I'm trying to save.

1992
01:43:11,800 --> 01:43:13,440
Tulshi's marriage has been fixed.

1993
01:43:14,240 --> 01:43:14,560
What?

1994
01:43:14,680 --> 01:43:17,080
Yes. Remember the government
servant I'd told you about?

1995
01:43:17,280 --> 01:43:18,160
The same guy.

1996
01:43:18,840 --> 01:43:19,880
Tulshi's happy?

1997
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,000
Well, she agreed.

1998
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:25,880
Even I had agreed,
when I didn't have any other option.

1999
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:28,400
So she agreed due to lack
of option or she genuinely agreed?

2000
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:33,040
Tulshi agreed willingly,
no one forced her.

2001
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,600
Like your family had forced you.

2002
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:38,760
She is smart, she understands.

2003
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:40,440
I was no fool either,

2004
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:43,640
but I didn't know that my husband
would turn out to be such a weirdo.

2005
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,840
I can neither stay
with him nor leave him.

2006
01:43:49,720 --> 01:43:50,120
I understand.

2007
01:43:50,240 --> 01:43:51,600
No, you don't.

2008
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,160
Your life isn't
messed up because of a wrong girl.

2009
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:04,320
There's just one girl in my life.

2010
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:06,200
Kavya.

2011
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:08,520
And I am with her.

2012
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:13,760
Tell me something?

2013
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:14,480
Yes, my love?

2014
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:17,960
How did you know the groom's father
was going to ask for dowry?

2015
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,280
You went there
prepared with a recorder,

2016
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:21,760
and recorded the entire conversation!

2017
01:44:26,280 --> 01:44:27,520
Good question.

2018
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:31,560
You see, I am a detective.

2019
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:34,280
I have a killer instinct.

2020
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:38,240
I've managed to expose
49 boys so far, Kavya.

2021
01:44:38,480 --> 01:44:44,000
I can judge a person's character
just by looking at his gait.

2022
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:50,640
So skilled, huh, Sherlock?

2023
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:53,040
You are making fun of me?

2024
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,280
Hmm?

2025
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:56,320
You think this is funny?

2026
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:00,800
Kavya, we meet like this
to spend some quality time together,

2027
01:45:01,120 --> 01:45:03,760
but you always end up mocking me.

2028
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:06,320
We are not a married couple.

2029
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,280
Understood me?

2030
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:10,280
Yes, I did!

2031
01:45:10,680 --> 01:45:12,360
You don't always have to remind me!

2032
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:17,440
Kavya?

2033
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:20,160
Kavya?

2034
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:21,560
Kavya!

2035
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:26,400
Stop tickling me, man.

2036
01:45:33,560 --> 01:45:34,360
Thank you, that's enough.

2037
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:35,320
Give me your camera, bro.

2038
01:45:35,440 --> 01:45:37,480
Sir, please do visit again.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

2039
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:22,600
There she is.

2040
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,280
Have a seat.

2041
01:46:25,680 --> 01:46:26,760
Tulshi...

2042
01:46:27,240 --> 01:46:28,600
Meet Ashok.

2043
01:46:28,720 --> 01:46:29,480
Hello.

2044
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,280
Ashok's parents.

2045
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:32,320
Hello.

2046
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,080
See, I brought them straight here.

2047
01:46:34,200 --> 01:46:36,480
They should know
what your work involves.

2048
01:46:36,600 --> 01:46:37,200
Right.

2049
01:46:37,400 --> 01:46:38,080
I like her!

2050
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:40,520
She's pristine.

2051
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:42,360
Nice catch!

2052
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:47,040
Do you guys have any questions?

2053
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:48,040
No.

2054
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:49,840
No questions.

2055
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:50,840
But I have a few.

2056
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:52,800
Go ahead, and ask them then.

2057
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:53,840
Go on.

2058
01:46:54,120 --> 01:46:57,840
I'll continue to be a DJ even after
marriage, so if that's an issue...

2059
01:46:57,960 --> 01:46:59,760
It's not an issue.
We're okay with it.

2060
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:03,200
And you'll have to hire
a maid to do household chores.

2061
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:05,040
Mom will do it.

2062
01:47:05,440 --> 01:47:06,680
She's anyway doing it.

2063
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:08,560
Washing clothes, doing the dishes,
sweeping and mopping the floor.

2064
01:47:08,680 --> 01:47:10,800
She doesn't let anyone
enter the kitchen.

2065
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:12,480
All in one!

2066
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:14,720
Does anyone in your family snore?

2067
01:47:14,840 --> 01:47:15,760
Dad.

2068
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:17,280
He snores.

2069
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:19,760
But we can always clip his nose.

2070
01:47:19,880 --> 01:47:20,440
Huh?

2071
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:21,880
Problem solved.

2072
01:47:25,960 --> 01:47:27,960
Anyway, forget that.

2073
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:30,840
So tell me, what do you think?

2074
01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:32,200
He's crazy.

2075
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:32,920
Huh?

2076
01:47:33,240 --> 01:47:35,400
I mean for your sister.

2077
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:36,400
- Oh yes.
- Okay.

2078
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:40,640
What I don't understand is,
why are you rushing the wedding?

2079
01:47:40,760 --> 01:47:42,120
- You see...
- Hey.

2080
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:49,640
No, you see uncle,
it's a very auspicious day.

2081
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:50,800
Right.

2082
01:47:50,920 --> 01:47:51,880
- Very auspicious.
- Very.

2083
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:55,640
Our family always sticks
to doing things at the right time.

2084
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,600
We are very religious.

2085
01:47:58,720 --> 01:47:59,440
Right.

2086
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:03,640
We consult the charts before
sending her to the disco everyday.

2087
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:04,640
We even break
a coconut, as its auspicious.

2088
01:48:04,760 --> 01:48:05,800
- Yes.
- Right.

2089
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,360
Don't you think we're overdoing it?

2090
01:48:09,120 --> 01:48:10,840
Dad, finalise it already!

2091
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,240
Okay, son.

2092
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:18,640
We are happy with whatever
makes our son happy.

2093
01:48:18,760 --> 01:48:20,080
- Yeah!
- Brother-in-law!

2094
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:22,600
Congratulations.

2095
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:23,920
Congratulations.

2096
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:27,960
Come with me.

2097
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:29,280
Madhu!

2098
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:30,240
Stay put.

2099
01:48:30,360 --> 01:48:31,960
- Yes!
- Tulshi?

2100
01:48:34,080 --> 01:48:34,840
One beer, please.

2101
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:35,960
Strong.

2102
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:37,880
Yes, strong.

2103
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:39,080
And soda for me.

2104
01:48:41,160 --> 01:48:42,160
Are you happy?

2105
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:44,840
Never been happier!

2106
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:48,560
Now all my college friends will
see what a beautiful wife I have.

2107
01:48:48,680 --> 01:48:51,400
I'll take her out every day &amp; every night.

2108
01:48:52,200 --> 01:48:54,720
She looks even more
pristine in western clothes!

2109
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,600
Cancel the soda.
Get me a beer instead.

2110
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:01,480
Speed up.

2111
01:49:03,920 --> 01:49:05,920
Why are you bubble packing that drum?

2112
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:07,640
We're going back to Moga.

2113
01:49:07,840 --> 01:49:09,080
You can play it there.

2114
01:49:09,640 --> 01:49:11,280
Why are we moving back to Moga?

2115
01:49:11,480 --> 01:49:12,480
I want to stay here.

2116
01:49:12,680 --> 01:49:14,640
I have a school picnic next week,
to Essel World.

2117
01:49:14,760 --> 01:49:18,520
We have no choice,
after all the slandering we have faced.

2118
01:49:18,640 --> 01:49:22,000
Everyone will know that
we are the victims here

2119
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:25,120
after the one who slandered us
gets slandered and ends up in prison.

2120
01:49:26,200 --> 01:49:27,360
Bro!

2121
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:29,760
Wait up, bro.

2122
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:30,680
You are all worked up.

2123
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,320
What's the game plan?
Do share.

2124
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:36,680
Yesterday, I followed Kavya Godbole,
Madhu's lawyer.

2125
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:37,840
Do you know who she is?

2126
01:49:37,960 --> 01:49:38,520
Who?

2127
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:40,040
Madhu's old flame.

2128
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:40,520
What?

2129
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,800
An old flame that wouldn't extinguish.

2130
01:49:43,080 --> 01:49:45,560
Both of them were making
whoopee in Marine Hotel.

2131
01:49:45,680 --> 01:49:46,480
What are you saying, bro?

2132
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:50,760
Here I am yearning for a grain of sugar
while he's feasting on a sugarcane!

2133
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:51,360
Sugarcane!

2134
01:49:51,480 --> 01:49:53,480
- That rascal!
- Bloody scoundrel.

2135
01:49:53,600 --> 01:49:55,880
He, who's coquetting
an innocent man's wife,

2136
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,800
is trying to find faults in all other
innocent boys across the world, huh!

2137
01:49:59,080 --> 01:50:01,200
He's firing someone
else's licensed gun,

2138
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:04,360
while telling us not to explode
firecrackers in our own backyard!

2139
01:50:04,680 --> 01:50:06,120
He needs to be punished, Sukhi.

2140
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,120
- Yes, he should be.
- We'll get him punished, bro.

2141
01:50:08,240 --> 01:50:09,440
- Yes, he deserves it.
- But how, bro?

2142
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:10,960
We've tried to outsmart him before,

2143
01:50:11,080 --> 01:50:12,960
but our family ended up
packing for Moga.

2144
01:50:13,080 --> 01:50:14,120
This time we'll send him away for good.

2145
01:50:14,240 --> 01:50:15,040
- Where?
- To prison.

2146
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:16,800
What was the charge
he used against us, dowry, right?

2147
01:50:16,920 --> 01:50:18,320
We'll accuse him of adultery!

2148
01:50:18,440 --> 01:50:20,400
We'll book him under
all the possible sections.

2149
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,840
What does adultery imply, bro?

2150
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:25,000
To have an affair with a
married woman is against the law.

2151
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,280
Do you know the jail time for it?

2152
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,160
Six months!

2153
01:50:27,560 --> 01:50:30,040
Oh so, it's similar to milk adulteration.

2154
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:32,520
But who'll file those
charges against him?

2155
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:36,520
Her husband, Professor Chinmay Godbole.

2156
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:51,040
So,

2157
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,000
we know the basics of mathematics.

2158
01:50:55,360 --> 01:50:59,800
When the section cuts the
conic in exactly horizontal fashion,

2159
01:51:00,160 --> 01:51:04,760
then formed section is exactly circular.

2160
01:51:29,440 --> 01:51:30,560
Why's he walking like that?

2161
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:31,440
Like what?

2162
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:32,360
Like that!

2163
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,760
Yes, why is he walking like that?

2164
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,360
- Let's find out.
- Yeah.

2165
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:56,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

2166
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:03,040
Do I know you?

2167
01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:04,680
No.

2168
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:06,440
Then why smile?

2169
01:52:07,640 --> 01:52:08,880
We are here to meet you.

2170
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:12,000
Roll your sleeves up.

2171
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,080
Huh?

2172
01:52:14,680 --> 01:52:16,600
That one's up, so roll this one as well.

2173
01:52:21,800 --> 01:52:22,760
One and a half spoon of tea powder?

2174
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:23,560
Yes, sir.

2175
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:25,200
Milk?

2176
01:52:25,320 --> 01:52:26,360
75ml, sir.

2177
01:52:31,440 --> 01:52:33,320
Nope, it contains more, check.

2178
01:52:33,600 --> 01:52:34,960
I'll make you another cup, sir.

2179
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:35,920
Sorry, sir.

2180
01:52:39,080 --> 01:52:40,240
So, why did you want to meet me?

2181
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:44,480
Because we have a common enemy.

2182
01:52:46,040 --> 01:52:47,480
Purshottam Godse?

2183
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:49,640
No, he's all yours.
I'm talking about someone else.

2184
01:52:50,360 --> 01:52:51,280
Rane.

2185
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:53,480
Madhu Mangal Rane.

2186
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:54,960
Resides in Girgaon.

2187
01:52:55,920 --> 01:52:57,120
A wedding detective.

2188
01:52:57,240 --> 01:52:58,360
I am sure you know him.

2189
01:52:58,480 --> 01:52:59,400
Ranganathan.

2190
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:01,720
Swami Ranganathan.

2191
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:04,440
Owns a small restaurant in Madras.

2192
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:07,680
Do you know him?

2193
01:53:08,080 --> 01:53:08,600
No.

2194
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,400
Then what makes you
think I know your guy?

2195
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:15,320
Sir, your wife Kavya is having
an affair with this Madhu Mangal Rane.

2196
01:53:16,040 --> 01:53:17,920
Both of them enter the hotel discreetly,

2197
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:20,200
but in the hotel room they
become completely carefree.

2198
01:53:21,440 --> 01:53:23,040
And why are you telling me this?

2199
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:24,320
That's strange, sir.

2200
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:27,320
We've come so far to tell you
this and you are taking it so lightly?

2201
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:28,160
What do you want?

2202
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:29,480
You are not getting it, sir.

2203
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:32,080
He's adulterating your pure milk.

2204
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,520
You should send him to prison.

2205
01:53:33,720 --> 01:53:35,560
Adultery is not allowed, sir.
You should teach him a lesson.

2206
01:53:35,680 --> 01:53:36,320
Yes, you should.

2207
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:36,920
Yes.

2208
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,280
Who'd go to the police station?

2209
01:53:40,600 --> 01:53:41,480
And then the court?

2210
01:53:41,880 --> 01:53:43,360
Nothing is proper there.

2211
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:44,720
Files!

2212
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:47,000
They just lie scattered everywhere.

2213
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:49,960
The chairs and tables
aren't properly aligned.

2214
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:51,440
Plus the crowd.

2215
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:52,920
People!

2216
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,720
Everything is scattered.

2217
01:53:56,840 --> 01:53:58,080
Unorganised!

2218
01:53:58,480 --> 01:54:00,040
So, you'll spare him?

2219
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:01,400
You won't seek revenge?

2220
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:02,560
Do I care?

2221
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:05,520
I don't.

2222
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,400
Please straighten
that chair before leaving.

2223
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:49,440
Oh, someone's henna's
turn out to be pretty dark.

2224
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,480
Mom, her future husband loves her a lot.

2225
01:54:54,240 --> 01:54:56,160
That's the henna I had
applied for the engagement.

2226
01:54:57,080 --> 01:54:58,360
It still hasn't faded.

2227
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:01,840
She's getting married to Ashok
with Suraj's henna on her hands.

2228
01:55:01,960 --> 01:55:04,120
This is the first time
I've witnessed such a thing.

2229
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,440
Hey, Tulshi?

2230
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:09,560
You are happy, right?

2231
01:55:10,440 --> 01:55:11,680
Are you happy, Dada?

2232
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:14,400
What do you mean?
I am happy if you are.

2233
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:17,920
Same goes, I am happy if you are.

2234
01:55:33,200 --> 01:55:34,440
Tulshi?

2235
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:37,640
Do you still love Suraj?

2236
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:38,720
Hmm?

2237
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,240
His family demanded dowry, Dada.

2238
01:55:41,960 --> 01:55:43,680
Do you think I should marry such a boy?

2239
01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:46,480
What if they hadn't asked for dowry?

2240
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:50,320
I'd still be getting married,

2241
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:53,920
except, the groom
wouldn't have been Ashok.

2242
01:56:26,200 --> 01:56:26,920
Let's go, Sukhi.

2243
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:28,200
Where to?

2244
01:56:28,280 --> 01:56:29,200
To the professor's house.

2245
01:56:29,280 --> 01:56:29,840
Why?

2246
01:56:30,120 --> 01:56:31,480
Do you still think you can convince him?

2247
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:33,200
I have never met such
a weird man in my life.

2248
01:56:33,280 --> 01:56:34,240
Sukhi, my man...

2249
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:36,080
- What are you doing?
- Every lock has a key.

2250
01:56:36,160 --> 01:56:38,120
And a lock without that
key needs to be hammered open.

2251
01:56:38,200 --> 01:56:39,440
- Got it?
- Nope.

2252
01:56:39,520 --> 01:56:41,480
Madhu's old flame will now
pay a heavy price.

2253
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:42,800
Old flame?
How old?

2254
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:45,120
Old is old. 20 years old!

2255
01:56:45,200 --> 01:56:46,200
Why do you always have to argue?

2256
01:56:46,280 --> 01:56:47,560
I am not arguing, bro.
I am just asking.

2257
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:48,920
Kavya was going to marry him,

2258
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:49,960
but she was married off
to Godbole instead.

2259
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,200
Dammit.

2260
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:52,240
That's one sad story.

2261
01:56:52,600 --> 01:56:53,920
Ah, so the scoundrel's
love was genuinely true.

2262
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,840
Wonderful, so his love is true
and what about mine?

2263
01:56:58,440 --> 01:56:59,880
He sent my entire family to prison!

2264
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:03,000
I won't rest in peace till
I don't put him behind bars.

2265
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:04,640
I am sure you'll manage that, bro.

2266
01:57:04,720 --> 01:57:06,680
A heartbroken lover
can achieve the impossible.

2267
01:57:07,080 --> 01:57:08,320
Take Madhu Mangal Rane for example.

2268
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:12,120
He cursed so many boys with lifetime of
bachelorhood because he couldn't marry Kavya.

2269
01:57:22,680 --> 01:57:25,000
These breads aren't exactly circular.
Make them circular.

2270
01:57:25,600 --> 01:57:28,440
They won't stay circular in your stomach,
just eat them.

2271
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:29,280
I need to go to work.

2272
01:57:29,360 --> 01:57:31,200
Get this done first.

2273
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,440
Even the okra aren't of the same size.

2274
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:40,240
You can resize them yourself.

2275
01:57:41,200 --> 01:57:42,440
The knife is crooked too.

2276
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:02,960
Poor thing!

2277
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:05,800
He's made her life a living hell.

2278
01:58:06,320 --> 01:58:08,000
Let's go meet the weirdo, come on.

2279
01:58:09,080 --> 01:58:09,880
Come on!

2280
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:15,600
Hey professor!

2281
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:17,280
Sir!

2282
01:58:17,360 --> 01:58:18,480
- How are you doing, sir?
- Hey...

2283
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:19,480
So, how's life?

2284
01:58:19,560 --> 01:58:20,480
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

2285
01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:21,520
- Hello.
- Have a seat.

2286
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:23,000
No, hold on.

2287
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:24,320
How can you enter...

2288
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:25,680
Straighten the chair.

2289
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:27,720
You mean like this or like that?

2290
01:58:28,360 --> 01:58:30,280
What is this behaviour?
I don't understand.

2291
01:58:30,360 --> 01:58:31,640
How can you enter my house like this?

2292
01:58:31,720 --> 01:58:33,320
With our legs, bro.

2293
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:35,320
- Sukhi?
- Yeah.

2294
01:58:35,400 --> 01:58:36,040
Have an apple.

2295
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:37,400
Thanks, I don't like okra anyway.

2296
01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:39,200
Wash it at least.

2297
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:40,240
It's clean. Want a bite?

2298
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,360
Professor? Yo, professor?

2299
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,840
Don't mind, I know you are pretty useless,

2300
01:58:42,920 --> 01:58:44,800
but still there's something
you can do for me.

2301
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:46,520
I am not going to do anything for you.

2302
01:58:46,600 --> 01:58:48,320
Please, just leave!

2303
01:58:48,600 --> 01:58:49,320
Please.

2304
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:50,920
Sir, where did you get this crockery from?

2305
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,760
Looks like made in Germany.

2306
01:58:52,840 --> 01:58:53,600
No, no.

2307
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:54,840
But I don't like these spoons.

2308
01:58:54,920 --> 01:58:55,320
I hate this one.

2309
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:56,920
- That one...
- Nope, don't like this one either.

2310
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:59,360
None of them are good.

2311
01:59:01,200 --> 01:59:04,600
This is what I am going to do every day
if you don't do as I say.

2312
01:59:04,680 --> 01:59:06,920
I'll keep visiting your residence
and your college.

2313
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:11,080
I'll make your entire life
unorganised and scattered.

2314
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:16,160
Is he dead?

2315
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,720
No, just scattered!

2316
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:18,640
Throw some water on his face.

2317
01:59:24,920 --> 01:59:26,440
Idiots! Speed up.
You want me to get up there?

2318
01:59:26,520 --> 01:59:26,840
Kaka?

2319
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:28,160
Hey superman!

2320
01:59:28,240 --> 01:59:29,440
Get down.

2321
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:30,280
What?

2322
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:32,360
I think,

2323
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:34,760
he won't show up.

2324
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:36,160
Let's just cancel the wedding.

2325
01:59:36,760 --> 01:59:38,000
Are you crazy!

2326
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:50,440
Kaka!

2327
01:59:51,280 --> 01:59:53,880
Do you think he's the
right choice for Tulshi?

2328
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:55,080
Be honest with me.

2329
01:59:56,240 --> 01:59:56,960
You want me to be honest?

2330
01:59:57,040 --> 01:59:57,600
Hmm.

2331
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:01,080
The one who was perfect for Tulshi...

2332
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:04,120
...is rotting in jail with his family,
thanks to you!

2333
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:08,480
Kaka...

2334
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:10,920
What?

2335
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:13,120
What do I do now?

2336
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:14,320
Do nothing.

2337
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:18,160
You are addicted to breaking marriages.

2338
02:00:18,360 --> 02:00:20,760
Have mercy on your sister,

2339
02:00:21,120 --> 02:00:22,160
your family,

2340
02:00:22,240 --> 02:00:24,000
and the entire community.
Please!

2341
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:28,360
Look, the groom's here.

2342
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:40,240
Does he plan to marry
Tulshi or kidnap her?

2343
02:00:50,960 --> 02:00:53,520
You've made my life, Dada.

2344
02:00:53,720 --> 02:00:54,840
All my relatives are going gaga.

2345
02:00:54,920 --> 02:00:56,640
"Ashok's wife is so beautiful."

2346
02:00:56,920 --> 02:00:57,920
"She's a hot babe."

2347
02:00:58,600 --> 02:00:59,520
They are all so jealous.

2348
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:02,240
Let them get jealous.

2349
02:01:02,360 --> 02:01:03,160
I am on cloud nine.

2350
02:01:03,520 --> 02:01:04,600
Thank you, Dada.

2351
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:07,000
Bless me, Kaka.

2352
02:01:17,080 --> 02:01:19,920
Hey, Tulshi listen,

2353
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:21,640
do you really want to marry this buffoon?

2354
02:01:22,240 --> 02:01:23,880
What is this nonsense, Madhu?

2355
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:24,400
Keep quiet.

2356
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:26,240
Dada, just get it done and over with.

2357
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,520
Marriage isn't everything in life, anyway.

2358
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:30,760
I want to be a DJ, have my own career.

2359
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:31,840
- But...
- Madhu!

2360
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:32,760
Madhu!

2361
02:01:32,840 --> 02:01:33,600
What happened?

2362
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:35,760
What happened?

2363
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,160
Chinmay signed the papers.

2364
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:39,000
What papers?

2365
02:01:39,080 --> 02:01:40,080
Divorce papers!

2366
02:01:41,640 --> 02:01:42,200
This...

2367
02:01:42,520 --> 02:01:43,280
How?

2368
02:01:43,640 --> 02:01:44,600
Suraj Dhillon.

2369
02:01:45,120 --> 02:01:45,800
Suraj?

2370
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:05,760
How did he pull this off?

2371
02:02:05,840 --> 02:02:07,040
I don't know.

2372
02:02:07,120 --> 02:02:08,720
Chinmay asked me to tell Suraj that,

2373
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:11,200
he's leaving me for good, so now
Suraj should leave him alone.

2374
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:12,160
Where's Suraj?

2375
02:02:12,240 --> 02:02:12,680
I don't know.

2376
02:02:12,760 --> 02:02:14,880
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

2377
02:02:17,560 --> 02:02:19,640
Listen, it's quite crowded outside.

2378
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:20,880
We'll have to leave stealthily.

2379
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:22,120
There are 15 minutes left
for the rituals to begin.

2380
02:02:22,200 --> 02:02:23,040
And what about the wedding?

2381
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:28,560
You said that you'd marry Suraj if his
parents hadn't asked for dowry, right?

2382
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,280
Oh, good lord!

2383
02:02:31,600 --> 02:02:33,280
This means you were responsible
for that shenanigan!

2384
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:36,160
- Mom, mom, mom!
- I knew it!

2385
02:02:36,240 --> 02:02:37,640
Suraj is such a nice boy.

2386
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:41,320
Dada, you broke your sister's
marriage just to take your revenge?

2387
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,560
- No, I...
- I knew it!

2388
02:02:42,640 --> 02:02:44,000
I know you since 20 years now.

2389
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:47,040
- You too...?
- You are so going to hell for this.

2390
02:02:47,240 --> 02:02:49,520
You'll suffer from all possible
gross diseases in old age.

2391
02:02:49,600 --> 02:02:50,600
And mind you,
your old age is around the corner.

2392
02:02:50,680 --> 02:02:51,440
Just a matter of two years!

2393
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,800
Hey, hey, hey, that's enough.

2394
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:54,320
We have just ten minutes left now.

2395
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,040
Do you want to be with Suraj
or marry Ashok?

2396
02:02:57,120 --> 02:02:57,800
Tell me.

2397
02:02:58,080 --> 02:02:58,760
Come on, tell me.

2398
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:05,360
Mr. Bhave, how many years has it been
since you became the commissioner?

2399
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:07,920
I got promoted to that
post just six months back.

2400
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:08,680
Oh.

2401
02:03:08,760 --> 02:03:11,360
Before that, I was posted in Mulund,
Crime Branch, for seven years.

2402
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:14,920
Come, let me introduce you to Madhu.

2403
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:15,600
Sure.

2404
02:03:15,680 --> 02:03:17,520
Madhu, meet the groom's maternal uncle.

2405
02:03:19,640 --> 02:03:20,360
Hey...

2406
02:03:20,720 --> 02:03:21,760
Where are they going?

2407
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:23,560
Call the groom's maternal uncle.

2408
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:31,680
Hey, the groom's maternal
uncle is in the bride's makeup room.

2409
02:03:31,760 --> 02:03:32,760
Go, get him.

2410
02:03:33,880 --> 02:03:36,200
- Where are you going, man?
- To hell?

2411
02:03:36,280 --> 02:03:37,360
Buzz off now.

2412
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:38,600
- Madhu?
- Yes?

2413
02:03:38,680 --> 02:03:40,120
The groom's maternal uncle...

2414
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:42,720
Forget the groom's uncle.
They'll untie him.

2415
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:43,760
Untying him isn't the damn issue here.

2416
02:03:43,840 --> 02:03:46,440
He's a police commissioner.

2417
02:03:46,520 --> 02:03:47,320
Who?

2418
02:03:47,560 --> 02:03:48,880
The groom's maternal uncle?

2419
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:54,560
Why didn't you tell me?

2420
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:56,280
Did you give me a chance to tell you?

2421
02:03:56,360 --> 02:03:57,360
- You...
- Stop it guys!

2422
02:03:57,480 --> 02:03:58,720
How do we leave?

2423
02:03:59,160 --> 02:03:59,880
How do we leave?

2424
02:04:01,320 --> 02:04:02,240
Get in!

2425
02:04:02,320 --> 02:04:03,480
- Go, go, go.
- In this?

2426
02:04:03,560 --> 02:04:04,280
Hurry up, get in.

2427
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:05,200
Go, go, go.

2428
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:06,360
- Come on, get in.
- Go, go.

2429
02:04:06,440 --> 02:04:07,800
I found the keys!

2430
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:08,960
Get in.

2431
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:10,000
Let's leave.

2432
02:04:10,080 --> 02:04:11,560
Go, go, go.

2433
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:16,160
Move, move, move.

2434
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:17,520
Which one? Which one?

2435
02:04:17,600 --> 02:04:18,720
- Suraj!
- Which one?

2436
02:04:18,800 --> 02:04:19,600
This one.

2437
02:04:19,880 --> 02:04:21,000
- Suraj!
- Suraj!

2438
02:04:21,080 --> 02:04:22,720
- Suraj!
- Suraj!

2439
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:23,840
- Suraj!
- Suraj!

2440
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:25,080
- Go, go, go.
- Where are you going, mister?

2441
02:04:25,160 --> 02:04:25,520
Huh?

2442
02:04:25,600 --> 02:04:27,520
They sold everything and left for Moga.

2443
02:04:27,920 --> 02:04:28,680
When?

2444
02:04:28,760 --> 02:04:29,800
Their train leaves at two.

2445
02:04:29,880 --> 02:04:31,720
I'm pretty sure they must've bought
the ticket by now.

2446
02:04:33,360 --> 02:04:34,600
Dada, will we be able to reach on time?

2447
02:04:34,680 --> 02:04:37,360
He'll wait for you,
even if the train leaves.

2448
02:04:37,440 --> 02:04:40,560
Sister, it seems like you watched
a Bollywood flick on TV last night.

2449
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:41,600
This is not how it plays out in real life.

2450
02:04:41,680 --> 02:04:42,720
Drive, drive, drive.

2451
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:02,280
Which way?

2452
02:05:02,960 --> 02:05:04,400
Platform No. 10!

2453
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:06,280
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Platform No. 10!

2454
02:05:07,360 --> 02:05:08,240
Suraj!

2455
02:05:08,360 --> 02:05:10,360
Suraj! Have you seen a Sikh gentleman?

2456
02:05:10,440 --> 02:05:11,080
Suraj!

2457
02:05:14,280 --> 02:05:15,240
Suraj!

2458
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:16,640
- Suraj!
- Suraj!

2459
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:19,640
Bro, may I ask something?

2460
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,360
The train is leaving!

2461
02:05:21,440 --> 02:05:22,760
Guddi, please stop bugging me.

2462
02:05:22,840 --> 02:05:27,120
What will you do if Tulsi
shows up dressed as a bride?

2463
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:28,600
I'll tell her to go to hell.

2464
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,760
That's what she'd told me.

2465
02:05:29,840 --> 02:05:31,000
Then go and tell her.

2466
02:05:31,080 --> 02:05:32,200
Look, there she is!

2467
02:05:32,280 --> 02:05:33,200
Over there!

2468
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:35,120
Faster, faster, faster!

2469
02:05:35,440 --> 02:05:36,800
Dad, I'll be back in a jiffy.

2470
02:05:37,200 --> 02:05:38,920
Is that Tulsi?

2471
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:40,520
Suraj, please forgive me!

2472
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:42,480
What does he want now?

2473
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:43,080
Suraj!

2474
02:05:43,160 --> 02:05:44,000
Suraj!

2475
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,040
- Suraj!
- Suraj, please forgive me!

2476
02:05:46,120 --> 02:05:47,240
Go to hell.

2477
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:48,960
What's the use of apologising now anyway?

2478
02:05:49,040 --> 02:05:50,520
Someone stop the train.

2479
02:05:50,600 --> 02:05:52,240
He's brought the whole jingbang along.

2480
02:05:52,320 --> 02:05:54,680
The train is already in motion.

2481
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:56,560
Goodbye!
Enjoy running all the way to Moga.

2482
02:05:56,640 --> 02:05:58,080
Don't go, Suraj!

2483
02:05:58,160 --> 02:06:00,440
First tell me, did you marry that guy?

2484
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:02,560
What do you think?

2485
02:06:11,800 --> 02:06:13,120
Give us a hand!

2486
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:14,200
Oh right.

2487
02:06:23,080 --> 02:06:23,880
Be careful, dear.

2488
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:25,080
Oh no, the train's picking up speed.

2489
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:26,480
- Hey.
- Hurry up.

2490
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:27,640
Aunty...

2491
02:06:27,720 --> 02:06:29,320
You'll fall!

2492
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:30,560
- Get inside.
- Get inside, bro.

2493
02:06:38,440 --> 02:06:41,280
Hey, some help here as well.

2494
02:06:41,360 --> 02:06:42,840
How can you leave us, man?

2495
02:06:43,240 --> 02:06:46,520
Migrants don't need to go back just
because Bombay's name changed to Mumbai.

2496
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:47,960
We are not leaving.

2497
02:06:48,040 --> 02:06:49,800
Our buffalos are on summer break.

2498
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:51,400
We are taking them to Moga for a vacation,

2499
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:52,280
all thanks to you!

2500
02:06:52,360 --> 02:06:53,160
Sorry.

2501
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:54,200
Forgive me!

2502
02:06:54,320 --> 02:06:56,680
- Please forgive me.
- Help me up, guys.

2503
02:06:56,760 --> 02:06:57,400
Oh shit!

2504
02:06:57,480 --> 02:06:58,600
Give me your hand.

2505
02:06:59,040 --> 02:06:59,920
Tulsi, give me your hand.

2506
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:01,320
Why doesn't anyone stop the train?

2507
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:02,840
- Tulsi, give me your hand!
- Hurry up, Tulshi!

2508
02:07:02,920 --> 02:07:03,760
Tulsi, give me your hand.

2509
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:05,160
Give me your hand Tulsi,
what are you doing?

2510
02:07:05,240 --> 02:07:06,200
- Tulsi!
- Tulshi!

2511
02:07:16,440 --> 02:07:17,720
What if I'd married that buffoon?

2512
02:07:18,640 --> 02:07:19,680
Then I'd have you two divorced.

2513
02:07:20,040 --> 02:07:21,120
Just like how I got Kavya divorced.

2514
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:22,840
And why did you do that?

2515
02:07:22,920 --> 02:07:24,280
I obviously didn't do it for him.

2516
02:07:25,360 --> 02:07:28,280
I thought if not me, at least
Kavya should get to be with her true love.

2517
02:07:28,680 --> 02:07:30,120
And you didn't think about us?

2518
02:07:30,280 --> 02:07:31,280
About me?

2519
02:07:31,360 --> 02:07:34,000
You left me for that government servant!

2520
02:07:34,080 --> 02:07:35,640
He looks like a frog.

2521
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:36,920
You weren't taking my calls.

2522
02:07:37,080 --> 02:07:38,560
You didn't reply to the messages
I'd paged you either.

2523
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:39,400
So what?

2524
02:07:39,480 --> 02:07:42,400
You could have just showed up
like you used to, stealthily.

2525
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,720
You could have sent me a letter,
or a telegram.

2526
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:46,240
And what if he had
intercepted the telegram?

2527
02:07:46,600 --> 02:07:48,040
We'd get sued by the postal
department as well.

2528
02:07:48,120 --> 02:07:49,000
No, I wouldn't have done such a thing.

2529
02:07:49,080 --> 02:07:50,960
Bullshit! That's what he always says.

2530
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:55,200
Look, I have such a nice son-in-law...
er, future son-in-law!

2531
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:57,440
And my son is such a cunning rascal!

2532
02:07:57,520 --> 02:07:58,400
Yes, very cunning.

2533
02:07:58,480 --> 02:07:59,680
What exactly are you, son?

2534
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:02,080
You first call off the wedding
and get us imprisoned.

2535
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,880
Then you fix your sister's wedding
to someone else.

2536
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:07,240
And now when we are leaving,

2537
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:11,120
you once again call off your
sister's wedding and bring her here.

2538
02:08:11,280 --> 02:08:14,680
Tell me something,
how do you manage all these shenanigans?

2539
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:18,120
Your birthday should be declared
as a national holiday.

2540
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:19,280
No, I am serious!

2541
02:08:19,800 --> 02:08:21,520
- Mom...
- Uncle... uncle, please forgive me.

2542
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:23,360
I'm very very sorry, uncle.

2543
02:08:23,440 --> 02:08:24,800
I got you implicated in a false case.

2544
02:08:24,880 --> 02:08:26,160
He never demanded any dowry from me.

2545
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:27,000
That's what I have been saying!

2546
02:08:27,080 --> 02:08:28,600
- Heard that?
- That's what I have been saying all along.

2547
02:08:28,680 --> 02:08:30,600
Stop fighting,
now that both the families have united.

2548
02:08:30,680 --> 02:08:31,800
- Forget everything else.
- How can I forget it all?

2549
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:33,320
We had to sell our house, our shop.

2550
02:08:33,400 --> 02:08:34,960
Our cattle went on a summer break to Moga.

2551
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,400
- How can I just forget all that?
- Right, how can we forget?

2552
02:08:36,480 --> 02:08:37,320
- Bro...
- How?

2553
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:40,160
Do one thing, take my shop.

2554
02:08:40,240 --> 02:08:41,720
- No, no, no, no.
- Uncle...

2555
02:08:41,800 --> 02:08:44,280
Frisk him. See if he's hiding
a tape recorder somewhere.

2556
02:08:44,360 --> 02:08:45,080
- Yes, true.
- That's possible.

2557
02:08:45,160 --> 02:08:46,880
Who pulled the emergency brakes?

2558
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:47,640
Huh?

2559
02:08:47,720 --> 02:08:48,960
Who pulled the emergency brakes?

2560
02:08:49,040 --> 02:08:50,320
The brakes... sir, he pulled it!

2561
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,160
- No...
- Sir, he doesn't even have a ticket.

2562
02:08:52,240 --> 02:08:53,800
- What?
- Yes, I don't have a ticket.

2563
02:08:53,880 --> 02:08:55,600
You see, we came straight
from a wedding.

2564
02:08:55,680 --> 02:08:57,880
You need to pay 300 bucks for
pulling the emergency brakes,

2565
02:08:57,960 --> 02:08:59,920
and 70 for travelling without a ticket.
Pay up quickly!

2566
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:00,560
That's all?

2567
02:09:00,640 --> 02:09:02,400
Brother-in-law... can you please pay him?

2568
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:04,200
We came straight from the wedding.

2569
02:09:04,280 --> 02:09:05,360
We aren't carrying any cash.

2570
02:09:05,440 --> 02:09:06,200
You have any money on you?

2571
02:09:06,280 --> 02:09:07,240
- You don't have any money?
- No.

2572
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:09,160
Sir, what happens if he doesn't pay?

2573
02:09:09,240 --> 02:09:10,000
Jail.

2574
02:09:12,760 --> 02:09:14,240
Then sir, we, too,
don't have any money.

2575
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:15,560
- Suraj!
- You can put him behind bars.

2576
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:16,480
What?

2577
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:22,360
Sir!

2578
02:09:24,440 --> 02:09:26,280
We're even now, dearest brother-in-law.

2579
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:27,360
Let's go.

2580
02:09:27,680 --> 02:09:28,600
Come on.

2581
02:09:29,680 --> 02:09:30,720
How do we go home?

2582
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:31,960
Where's your motorbike?

2583
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:33,200
Remember,
you forced us to sell everything.

2584
02:09:33,360 --> 02:09:34,400
Let's travel by train.

2585
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,440
- The local train?
- Yes, why?

2586
02:09:37,600 --> 02:09:38,880
Is this how you plan to treat my sister?

2587
02:09:39,160 --> 02:09:40,640
You can always gift
me a motorbike.

2588
02:09:41,080 --> 02:09:42,560
Now bear the consequences
for what you'd accused me of.

2589
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:43,560
Really?

2590
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:45,040
We're going to travel in a local train?

2591
02:09:45,800 --> 02:09:47,000
But they are so crowded.

2592
02:09:47,080 --> 02:09:48,280
Let's take a cab instead.

2593
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:51,360
All kind of weird migrants from
all walks of life travel in the train.

2594
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:52,760
That's true.

2595
02:09:52,920 --> 02:09:54,240
Mumbai actually belongs
only to the fishermen.

2596
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:55,600
Everyone else has migrated
here from elsewhere.

2597
02:09:56,080 --> 02:09:57,080
So I'm a fisherman?

2598
02:09:57,160 --> 02:09:58,480
No, I didn't mean you.

2599
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:06,240
Clap.

2600
02:10:06,920 --> 02:10:07,680
Set

2601
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:08,480
And action.

2602
02:10:08,760 --> 02:10:10,400
Now all I need is a... dammit.

2603
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:11,000
Cut! Cut!

2604
02:10:11,360 --> 02:10:12,080
One more please.

2605
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:13,680
You know, this video isn't for me?

2606
02:10:13,760 --> 02:10:14,360
Huh?

2607
02:10:14,440 --> 02:10:15,800
It's for those poor girls

2608
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:18,280
whom never end up
getting proposals from...

2609
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:20,240
Action.

2610
02:10:21,160 --> 02:10:22,600
Oh my my, sister.

2611
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:25,800
Your voice... what?

2612
02:10:25,880 --> 02:10:26,760
Who's laughing?

2613
02:10:27,480 --> 02:10:31,560
You went past the marriageable age busy
trying to call off other's marriages.

2614
02:10:31,640 --> 02:10:32,440
And I forgot my lines.

2615
02:10:33,680 --> 02:10:37,720
Then you'll tell the world,
"I am Madhu Mangal's queen mother..."

2616
02:10:38,640 --> 02:10:41,560
"I am Madhu Mangal's queen mother..."

2617
02:10:43,120 --> 02:10:45,200
"I am Madhu Mangal's queen's mother..."

2618
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,280
"I am Madhu Mangal's Rane..."

2619
02:10:48,240 --> 02:10:49,760
But you know what kind of a boy I am.

2620
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:51,920
I don't even look at my buffalos... damn.

2621
02:10:53,640 --> 02:10:54,960
How do I explain it to him?

2622
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:56,280
He has anyway blah, blah, blah.

2623
02:10:56,360 --> 02:10:57,480
I fumbled.

2624
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:01,600
No, these brats are...

2625
02:11:01,680 --> 02:11:02,440
No.

2626
02:11:03,560 --> 02:11:04,360
Shrimatu.

2627
02:11:04,440 --> 02:11:05,280
Shrimatu.

2628
02:11:05,800 --> 02:11:06,520
Shrimaan...

2629
02:11:06,600 --> 02:11:07,520
- What are you saying?
- Mom!

2630
02:11:07,600 --> 02:11:08,760
- Madhu!
- What?

2631
02:11:12,160 --> 02:11:14,160
So what do we do next?

2632
02:11:15,880 --> 02:11:16,720
Sir...

2633
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:19,680
Kaka...

2634
02:11:22,600 --> 02:11:23,400
Hey.

2635
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:24,600
Government!

2636
02:11:24,680 --> 02:11:27,200
Government some... servant.

2637
02:11:29,320 --> 02:11:31,000
Eat, you won't get fat.

2638
02:11:31,920 --> 02:11:33,600
Where are you? Your hand keeps moving.

2639
02:11:35,080 --> 02:11:36,560
I've already short-listed two boys.

2640
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:37,800
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

2641
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:44,640
Fine, ask the mechanic to deliver it
and collect the payment.

2642
02:11:45,160 --> 02:11:47,960
No, that mechanic has already
handed it over to me.

2643
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:49,520
Now I'll have to come and deliver it.

2644
02:11:49,600 --> 02:11:51,400
Do you get a commission from him?

2645
02:11:52,520 --> 02:11:54,880
I was going to sit on the floor!

2646
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:56,840
Action!

2647
02:11:56,920 --> 02:11:58,080
Do you know the jail time for it?

2648
02:11:58,160 --> 02:11:59,440
Six months!

2649
02:12:00,080 --> 02:12:01,680
Oh so, it's milk adultery.

2650
02:12:01,960 --> 02:12:03,320
- No, "like milk adulteration".
- Oh, sorry, sorry.

2651
02:12:04,200 --> 02:12:05,000
Cut.

2652
02:12:06,200 --> 02:12:07,760
What's on your mind, huh?

2653
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:09,560
What hands were they?
Butter hands!

2654
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:11,640
I was supposed to say what history...

2655
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:14,040
Stop it... stop it.

2656
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:15,080
She's crazy.

2657
02:12:16,280 --> 02:12:17,000
Tulsi?

2658
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:19,280
Hello.

2659
02:12:23,120 --> 02:12:27,040
This is for you, a small gift...

2660
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:29,840
Oh no!

2661
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:33,120
- Uncle, that's what you call modern love.
- I know.

2662
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:34,800
Had you have ever done that?

2663
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:37,720
Oh no.

2664
02:12:39,120 --> 02:12:40,320
You call this love?

2665
02:12:40,800 --> 02:12:43,080
All the tall claims that you had made,
were for this?

2666
02:12:47,720 --> 02:12:50,960
Sir, you can cut the
cake at the police station, yeah?

2667
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:56,280
Wait... move it away.

2668
02:12:58,320 --> 02:12:59,160
Action!

2669
02:13:01,120 --> 02:13:02,200
I, too, was standing there.

2670
02:13:02,280 --> 02:13:02,880
One more.

2671
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:05,280
- What do you think?
- Give me a hand, man.

2672
02:13:05,480 --> 02:13:06,960
Come on, give me your hand.
Your hand..

2673
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:08,760
- He's still sitting in there.
- I know.

2674
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:09,840
Can I say something?

2675
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:12,920
Hey, we can make out that you are smiling.

2676
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:15,320
Smiling as well as pouting.

2677
02:13:21,600 --> 02:13:22,800
- Oh shit!
- Oh no, no, no.

2678
02:13:22,880 --> 02:13:26,800
The groom's family called in the morning
saying that they can't find the groom.

2679
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:27,920
The bride...

2680
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:32,360
If that idiot can get
married to a guy like Tulshi.

2681
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:34,200
Oops!!!
