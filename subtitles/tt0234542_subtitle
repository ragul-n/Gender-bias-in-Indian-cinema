1
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,518
India is the heart of
eastern countries

2
00:00:40,988 --> 00:00:56,216
Where knowledge was received
from Buddha, Mohammad and God

3
00:00:57,686 --> 00:01:04,379
And the holy books such as
the Geeta, Bible and Koran.

4
00:01:06,749 --> 00:01:14,045
This story begins from those
days when this country...

5
00:01:14,315 --> 00:01:17,871
...was a slave to the
British Government

6
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,672
But this country was awakened
from its slumber.

7
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:33,372
We have a wish in
our heart to sacrifice

8
00:01:33,976 --> 00:01:38,171
We have to gauge
the strength in our arms

9
00:05:10,694 --> 00:05:15,355
Daughter-in-law, send Hernam.
- Very well.

10
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,117
Yes, father?

11
00:05:34,722 --> 00:05:38,744
Om has come.
Go and alert him...

12
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,487
...that the British
Government has announced...

13
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:43,687
...a reward of Rs.1000
to the person giving tips

14
00:05:44,089 --> 00:05:48,950
Tell him, it's not safe for him
to stay home, so leave carefully

15
00:05:49,219 --> 00:05:50,379
O.K. Father

16
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,780
All the way I was thinking
that on reaching home...

17
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:59,016
I would get to hear the cry
of the newborn child.

18
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:04,312
I was wondering what our new
born should be named.

19
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,414
Take this.

20
00:06:10,681 --> 00:06:13,149
You are thinking of the child
yet to be born...

21
00:06:13,548 --> 00:06:18,071
...and I'm worried for you

22
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,611
When will this
fearful period end?

23
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,803
Our revolution has weakened the
strength of the British Government.

24
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:34,903
There's just one slogan on
every child's lips.

25
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,272
"BRITISHERS, QUIT INDIA"

26
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:44,101
Our country will soon
be free.

27
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:47,635
Speak softly or else the
police might come.

28
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:52,073
They have already come thrice.
- I know.

29
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:57,231
I'll be staying in Allahabad
for a week at the market.

30
00:07:02,571 --> 00:07:04,763
When did you receive
this letter?

31
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:09,959
Today itself.
Whose letter is it?

32
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:13,400
Sharma, from London.
- What does he write?

33
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,700
He writes, he misses
Banaras a lot.

34
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,756
He remembers the college days.
He's crazy.

35
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:26,627
He'd gone for studies but got
married and settled there.

36
00:07:28,298 --> 00:07:38,854
O.K., I'll leave
from the back door.

37
00:07:40,796 --> 00:07:47,318
What happened? Don't worry,
nothing will happen to me.

38
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,955
Please leave him.

39
00:08:00,556 --> 00:08:03,750
Sir, am I sure to get the reward?
- Yes.

40
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:15,152
He must have hidden
somewhere here, catch him.

41
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:23,511
Come out, or else
I shall shoot you.

42
00:08:55,146 --> 00:08:59,009
Inquilab... Zindabad
(Long Live the Revolution)

43
00:09:49,268 --> 00:09:50,664
It's a baby boy.

44
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:58,726
God will never forgive you.

45
00:10:38,557 --> 00:10:42,215
Everything has been ruined
in a few moments.

46
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:44,655
A few days ago, she was
blessed with everything.

47
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:51,013
Now she has neither a
husband women whose husband is immortal.

48
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:37,406
It's an insult to
his sacrifice.

49
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:43,431
This vermilion shall always
remain on my forehead.

50
00:12:02,904 --> 00:12:05,197
So you informed the police
about Om.

51
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:09,295
You are responsible for his
death and not the police.

52
00:12:09,536 --> 00:12:11,260
Speak softly, or else
someone might listen.

53
00:12:11,633 --> 00:12:21,089
They have given me a lot of
wealth. Let's go away from here.

54
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:26,161
Away from this house, this city.
- No, I will not go.

55
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:29,892
You are illiterate. If not
for yourself...

56
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:31,893
...at least for the children

57
00:12:32,195 --> 00:12:38,390
If we have wealth, we can afford
everything for our children.

58
00:12:38,930 --> 00:12:42,656
My father was a priest.

59
00:12:43,059 --> 00:12:46,324
Now that I have wealth...

60
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,355
...I'll nurture my children
like the Englishmen

61
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:55,080
I'll give you all the
happiness.

62
00:12:55,826 --> 00:13:01,085
A lady who has a good
husband needs nothing else.

63
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:06,545
Today, even though Om
brother has passed away...

64
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:10,586
The vermilion on Ganga's
forehead, still shines.

65
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:20,781
If you think, this vermilion
on your forehead, a blemish...

66
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,675
...then you may wipe it off.

67
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:27,850
Father says, people who
sacrifice their life...

68
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:31,642
...for the country, always remain
immortal. Only those die, who...

69
00:13:32,085 --> 00:13:37,208
...who are traitor. Am I a traitor?
- Yes

70
00:13:40,282 --> 00:13:43,610
If I'm a traitor, wipe off this
blemish, this vermilion.

71
00:14:03,544 --> 00:14:05,372
May you live long
daughter-in-law.

72
00:14:07,907 --> 00:14:14,569
It's gohat you
have done?

73
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:40,022
If there's no repentance,
then why there be penance.

74
00:14:40,467 --> 00:14:42,264
And if there's no penance...

75
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:47,191
Tomorrow everybody will
know your deeds.

76
00:14:48,934 --> 00:14:51,625
If the government can kill
patriots...

77
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:56,463
then the patriots will never
forgive the traitors.

78
00:15:10,363 --> 00:15:12,952
Ganga's house too is
destroyed by the fire.

79
00:15:13,461 --> 00:15:15,585
She's at the temple.
I'll bring her home

80
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,748
Omkar is my son.
He will stay with me.

81
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:58,242
I have no relation with this
family, this house and this city.

82
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:08,444
Think me to be dead from today
onwards as I shall never return.

83
00:16:28,679 --> 00:16:31,871
Every year you visit Badrinath,
won't you go this year?

84
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:38,135
I shall, when my daughter-in-law
gets her son Omkar back.

85
00:16:38,776 --> 00:16:41,035
It's over three months
since Hernam left.

86
00:16:41,607 --> 00:16:42,835
We searched him every
possible place.

87
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,900
There's neither a
photograph of his...

88
00:16:45,141 --> 00:16:46,504
to get it published in
the newspapers

89
00:16:46,874 --> 00:16:50,034
God alone knows where he is.
He shall surely return one day.

90
00:16:55,104 --> 00:17:00,594
There's evil in Hernam and
not the customs.

91
00:17:00,805 --> 00:17:03,997
Congratulation, Kaushalya has
given birth to a baby girl.

92
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:09,496
I hope daughter-in-law is O. K?
- Yes, both are fine.

93
00:18:20,352 --> 00:18:23,248
PURAB
(THE EAST)

94
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,097
Hello, Guruji.

95
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:52,319
Where is Bharat?

96
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:57,162
Bharat and Gopi have gone to Delhi
to celebrate the 26th of January.

97
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:24,449
Today 8:02 Silence, please sit down.

98
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:39,166
Now listen...

99
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:44,894
...the team which is to
perform now, conveys that...

100
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:53,534
they will present their items
in the language best known to all.

101
00:21:59,003 --> 00:22:05,728
If anybody fails to understand,
then it will be translated

102
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:28,721
Otherwise, this very language,
would ruin the entire program.

103
00:22:32,963 --> 00:22:35,087
Now please get ready.

104
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:19,467
Do you love Gopi?

105
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:20,931
How many times, would
you ask brother?

106
00:29:21,236 --> 00:29:23,830
Then why don't you tell her?

107
00:29:24,439 --> 00:29:30,959
I tried several times, but
I am unable to speak it out

108
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,598
People in Delhi too know
about it

109
00:29:37,601 --> 00:29:38,860
Why don't you tell her?

110
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:43,464
On reaching home, I'll
talk about it to Guruji

111
00:29:43,832 --> 00:29:45,356
But, what if Gopi refused?

112
00:29:45,701 --> 00:29:48,256
Gopi will not disobey her elders.

113
00:29:48,665 --> 00:29:50,892
O.K. I'll ask her for your
satisfaction.

114
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:58,528
Why are you standing here?
- Nobody has time for me.

115
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,994
Oh, so there's somebody you
care for.

116
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:05,123
But who cares for me
- Shall I ask you a question?

117
00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:10,416
Which question do you want to
ask me?

118
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:17,252
It's difficult to speak out
someone's heart.

119
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:23,616
That's the reason why, even
I couldn't speak out.

120
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,414
What can't you speak?

121
00:30:25,989 --> 00:30:29,545
That from the time I've seen
you, I've worshipped you

122
00:30:37,354 --> 00:30:40,045
Why are you quiet?
- What should I say?

123
00:30:42,087 --> 00:30:43,676
Is it yes from your side?

124
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:48,715
I too wanted to ask you the
same thing.

125
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:51,781
But I was scared that
you may feel bad.

126
00:30:52,251 --> 00:30:57,146
Fool. Why would I feel bad?
In fact I'm very happy.

127
00:30:57,749 --> 00:30:59,717
I'm happy too

128
00:31:01,347 --> 00:31:02,939
Now that both have agreed...

129
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:04,807
...I'll talk to Guruji on
returning home.

130
00:31:05,014 --> 00:31:08,638
No, not now.
- When?

131
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,108
After you return from London.

132
00:31:11,313 --> 00:31:14,471
Till then I'll lose
half my weight.

133
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:24,636
Did you see? I spoke of the
marriage and she ran away.

134
00:31:31,043 --> 00:31:32,405
It's their greatness...

135
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:35,599
...that they call me to stay
at their place in London.

136
00:31:39,905 --> 00:31:42,735
But will I not be
a burden on them.

137
00:31:44,205 --> 00:31:46,796
Guruji took lot of trouble
to nurture us by teaching.

138
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:53,696
Yes, and now that your Guruji
doesn't earn...

139
00:31:54,070 --> 00:32:01,262
from where does the family
get their food?

140
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:12,425
Son, you are even earning
while you are studying.

141
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,025
If we were not to be with
you...

142
00:32:16,364 --> 00:32:22,852
...you would have built a new
home with your earnings.

143
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:27,052
If your grandson, Omkar
was in my place...

144
00:32:27,463 --> 00:32:29,860
would you have spoken
such things to him?

145
00:32:30,196 --> 00:32:32,094
If you were Omkar, would
you say that...

146
00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:35,885
...grandfather has taken great
pains to nurture us?

147
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:38,985
Please forgive me for it

148
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:48,620
Sharma writes that, if Om's son
doesn't stay with us...

149
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:53,888
...we'll think that Om's
family after his death...

150
00:32:54,089 --> 00:32:57,249
...has broken all
bonds with us.

151
00:32:57,954 --> 00:33:02,251
And if you stay with them,
we will be at ease.

152
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,783
I hope Omkar and Hernam uncle
return before I come back

153
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:25,079
What are you thinking?

154
00:33:26,148 --> 00:33:31,513
I was thinking of those times
when people from far off...

155
00:33:31,716 --> 00:33:39,171
came here to learn, to attain
knowledge, as it was the only place...

156
00:33:39,479 --> 00:33:43,968
and now our people are going
abroad for higher studies

157
00:33:44,245 --> 00:33:47,971
It is for knowledge of science,
which is of great need

158
00:33:48,745 --> 00:33:55,575
You won't forget the culture
learnt from me, but I forgot.

159
00:33:56,144 --> 00:34:02,471
May you live long. Take this.
"The Bhagwat Geeta"

160
00:35:03,562 --> 00:35:08,423
You...
- I'm Mr. G.P. Sharma

161
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:10,585
Uncle...

162
00:35:15,625 --> 00:35:19,283
Daddy, I'll introduce
myself to you.

163
00:35:19,724 --> 00:35:26,144
I am his orphan son.
My name is Orphan.

164
00:35:27,755 --> 00:35:31,347
He's my son. I and his mother,
both are alive

165
00:35:33,987 --> 00:35:38,214
Here there's a fashion for
clothes and names.

166
00:35:40,986 --> 00:35:45,816
Just see his clothes.
Both keep changing daily.

167
00:35:46,019 --> 00:35:47,845
Why not? It's a fashion here.

168
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:50,641
Where life partners can be changed,
then why not the name?

169
00:35:51,016 --> 00:35:53,980
My parents' blood
runs in my veins...

170
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:57,149
...else I would've changed
them too.

171
00:35:57,948 --> 00:36:00,779
Do you like my ideas?

172
00:36:11,013 --> 00:36:13,103
She is your auntie?
Darling, he is Bharat.

173
00:36:15,943 --> 00:36:17,740
What are you looking for?

174
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:21,671
Son, here there's no tradition
of touching the feet of elders

175
00:36:21,878 --> 00:36:25,138
Being born and brought up
in India, I forgot...

176
00:36:25,243 --> 00:36:27,800
...that youngsters touch the
feet of elders for blessing

177
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,429
Then what's her fault?

178
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:34,100
She and her parents haven't
even seen India.

179
00:36:35,308 --> 00:36:39,364
By the way, she's an Indian.
Darling, where's Preeti?

180
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,166
She's my daughter.

181
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:51,500
AUR PASCHIM
(AND THE WEST)

182
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,093
Good morning sir.
- How are you Lalchandji?

183
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:40,850
Sir, you called me Lalchandji.
- Yes

184
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:46,390
Sir, for the first time
"ji" was added to my name

185
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,082
I was 15, when I came
here with my boss

186
00:37:51,355 --> 00:37:54,446
That time no one used it
since I was a kid.

187
00:37:54,656 --> 00:37:57,350
Here, it's not a tradition
to use such niceties.

188
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,987
Sometimes some people use
"Mister"

189
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:03,445
Your wife and children?

190
00:38:03,855 --> 00:38:11,411
I have a wife but no
children.

191
00:38:12,317 --> 00:38:15,218
Where's your wife?
- In Banaras.

192
00:38:16,051 --> 00:38:23,573
I got married when I was 8,
but my "gauna" didn't take place

193
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:24,907
"Gauna"?

194
00:38:25,317 --> 00:38:29,112
After the child marriage,
when the boy comes of age...

195
00:38:29,316 --> 00:38:31,804
he brings his wife home for the first
time, - which is called "Gauna"

196
00:38:32,282 --> 00:38:33,266
Very funny.

197
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:36,639
From childhood, I entered
boyhood and now into old age

198
00:38:36,879 --> 00:38:43,778
But yet the ritual of bringing
the bride home isn't completed

199
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:48,975
Mr. Lalchand is here
and Mrs. Lalchand is there

200
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,071
Then why don't you
go to Banaras?

201
00:38:51,476 --> 00:38:55,805
When I came here with boss,
my father had told me...

202
00:38:56,242 --> 00:39:02,230
...to serve him in such a
manner as Hanuman served Rama.

203
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:06,169
He even told me, never to
leave boss.

204
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:09,795
Boss didn't leave this place
so didn't I.

205
00:39:10,171 --> 00:39:12,363
I am the Hanuman of my boss.

206
00:39:12,804 --> 00:39:14,738
What Hanuman?

207
00:39:15,138 --> 00:39:19,796
To understand Hanuman, you
should first know Ram.

208
00:39:20,037 --> 00:39:21,525
Which Ram?

209
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:25,034
Lord Ram, the king of kings

210
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:28,860
His wife Sita, the purest
of the pure.

211
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:37,358
Something something Ram,
Something something Sita Ram

212
00:39:38,666 --> 00:39:39,997
Nice combination

213
00:40:07,892 --> 00:40:18,416
This is called long walk.
Isn't it beautiful?

214
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,311
It's very beautiful.

215
00:40:22,858 --> 00:40:27,344
And this is the emperor's palace.

216
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,586
Oh, Papa.
Let's go somewhere else.

217
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,678
Bharat is our guest. Ask him
what he wants to see?

218
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:43,584
What would you like to see?

219
00:40:45,817 --> 00:40:50,840
I've heard that William Shakespeare's
house is very pretty.

220
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:52,814
But that's quite far

221
00:40:56,548 --> 00:41:00,709
Then you take me where
you would like to go.

222
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:08,638
Take Bharat, where he wants

223
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:12,340
O.K. Where would you like
to go?

224
00:41:12,543 --> 00:41:14,374
But mind you, I like
excitement.

225
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:21,069
Should I say it?
- Yes.

226
00:41:22,276 --> 00:41:28,696
Then show me the place...

227
00:41:30,673 --> 00:41:33,196
...where Oodham Singh took
his oath.

228
00:41:35,106 --> 00:41:42,402
Singh, but what Singh?

229
00:41:49,336 --> 00:41:51,699
The oath which he took
at Jalianwala Baug.

230
00:41:53,236 --> 00:41:54,701
Which Baug?

231
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:00,431
Which is in Amritsar?
- What sar?

232
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:06,026
But where's that?

233
00:42:08,233 --> 00:42:12,562
In India, now don't ask
where India is.

234
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:17,393
Come with me

235
00:42:23,494 --> 00:42:25,519
Hello, my name is O.P.

236
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:29,891
Does O.P. Mean Om Prakash
or Omkar Prasad or...

237
00:42:30,163 --> 00:42:33,650
Just O.P.
- That's all O.P.

238
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,288
Which place do you belong to?

239
00:42:36,893 --> 00:42:39,415
You are now staying in London

240
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:42,179
But which part of India
do you belong to?

241
00:42:42,524 --> 00:42:45,752
You mean India? I haven't
seen it yet.

242
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:49,881
We haven't see India.
- But he has seen it.

243
00:42:53,255 --> 00:43:01,450
Hi Man. Meet Bharat.
- What name did you say?

244
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:08,674
Yes, Mohan and
this is Radha...

245
00:43:12,086 --> 00:43:17,641
Did you like it?
By the way this is Christina

246
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:23,378
I don't drink

247
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,675
Then will you have a cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

248
00:43:27,547 --> 00:43:32,411
When I came, I too avoided
all this. Just like you.

249
00:43:33,548 --> 00:43:36,637
Don't worry, in a few days time,
you too will become like me

250
00:43:42,811 --> 00:43:44,799
Hi Milli, can I have that
for a moment please?

251
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:50,375
You can wait in my flat, till
Preeti arrives with the car

252
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:53,871
I'll wait here for her.
You'll may go

253
00:45:54,181 --> 00:45:57,079
Well, if that's with you
then O.K., fine.

254
00:46:05,547 --> 00:46:09,569
You've come again.
I've told you several times.

255
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:13,834
Don't follow me. Whenever
I see, you are begging

256
00:46:15,443 --> 00:46:20,771
A beggar. Take this and get lost.
Come on, darling

257
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:51,168
I'll go away. Like every
other night and day

258
00:46:51,502 --> 00:46:55,367
Today I'll return without
being beaten up

259
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:04,364
Mohan's right. Why spoil our
country's name by begging?

260
00:47:06,665 --> 00:47:16,326
I'm a beggar, but I don't beg
for money.

261
00:47:16,798 --> 00:47:18,488
Then what do you beg for?

262
00:47:20,297 --> 00:47:25,386
My daughter's life, from my
son-in-law, Mohan.

263
00:47:25,961 --> 00:47:27,053
What?

264
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:38,291
Five years ago, Mohan married
my daughter in India.

265
00:47:39,092 --> 00:47:43,547
After four months of marriage,
he came here for studies.

266
00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:49,215
For just two years. But he
has still not returned.

267
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:53,281
He doesn't listen even
to his parents.

268
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:59,610
My daughter holds her son
and weeps all day.

269
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:06,443
She's waiting for him, the past
5 years, but he isn't returning.

270
00:48:10,784 --> 00:48:13,307
So you have come to take
Mohan back.

271
00:48:13,585 --> 00:48:17,513
Yes, I have sworn on
the holy Ganges...

272
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:22,573
...that, I will take him back along
with me, or else I won't return.

273
00:48:23,015 --> 00:48:28,912
You are the first person who
listened to me carefully.

274
00:48:29,213 --> 00:48:32,769
Otherwise Mohan's friends
used to beat me up.

275
00:48:34,847 --> 00:48:37,506
Are you new in his
companionship?

276
00:48:42,942 --> 00:48:45,240
I'm new to this city itself.

277
00:48:45,709 --> 00:48:47,176
Which place do you
belong to?

278
00:48:51,276 --> 00:48:56,205
Ganges is a very holy river.
But I want to only say that...

279
00:48:56,607 --> 00:49:02,302
...when you return, don't
take any blemish along...

280
00:49:02,708 --> 00:49:07,069
...that even the Ganges won't
be able to wash away.

281
00:49:11,504 --> 00:49:15,595
I'll meet Mohan tomorrow itself.
Everything will be O.K.

282
00:49:16,003 --> 00:49:22,366
I write the same to my daughter
that everything will be O.K.

283
00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:27,364
But I know that nothing
is going to be fine.

284
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,431
But even then, I'm trying.

285
00:49:32,031 --> 00:49:37,157
I'll make a move now.
- May you live long

286
00:49:46,962 --> 00:49:54,725
You old man...
I'm your son-in-law.

287
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:58,025
I have a son too.

288
00:50:17,191 --> 00:50:21,711
I warn you, if you speak
of my past to anyone, then...

289
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:27,216
Then what will you do?
- I'll kill you.

290
00:50:29,385 --> 00:50:34,342
I shall surely tell
the whole world.

291
00:50:35,617 --> 00:50:37,482
He's my son-in-law.

292
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:42,316
He is cheating an innocent
for his own desires...

293
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:44,175
and making another a culprit.

294
00:50:44,618 --> 00:50:54,310
He has a son too.
I have said it all.

295
00:50:54,915 --> 00:50:57,902
If you have the guts,
then beat me up.

296
00:50:59,215 --> 00:51:05,271
How can you kill a man
who's already dead?

297
00:51:58,134 --> 00:52:02,259
On which dog have you
laid a bet?

298
00:52:03,267 --> 00:52:06,720
It's not certain.
I'm at a loss.

299
00:52:18,795 --> 00:52:21,623
Daddy, at least tell me which
dog have you bet on.

300
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:25,724
My son, if you always ask me,
then what will you do in future?

301
00:52:25,761 --> 00:52:28,953
Daddy, I've suffered heavily
due to these dogs.

302
00:52:29,226 --> 00:52:33,555
But I've gained a lot of
wealth on it.

303
00:52:58,653 --> 00:53:01,380
I've lost again.
- And I've won again.

304
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:15,142
Daddy has asked me to bring
you along to the India Club.

305
00:53:15,782 --> 00:53:17,215
He'll meet us there.

306
00:53:22,181 --> 00:53:24,115
In which language is this novel?

307
00:53:24,848 --> 00:53:28,178
This is not a novel,
it is the Geeta.

308
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:31,602
I didn't ask the novel's name.

309
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,240
But the language in which
it has been written.

310
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,440
I'm also telling you
the same thing...

311
00:53:37,711 --> 00:53:39,505
...that it's not a novel,
but the Geeta.

312
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:47,070
Is Geeta the name of the
heroine of the novel?

313
00:53:47,942 --> 00:53:49,239
Sir, tea for you.

314
00:53:51,841 --> 00:53:53,863
Don't you know anything
about the Bhagwad Geeta.

315
00:53:57,172 --> 00:54:00,164
Sir, she doesn't know anything
about Seeta too.

316
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:04,468
To know about Seeta,
you should read the "Ramayana".

317
00:54:04,771 --> 00:54:06,568
And to know about Geeta, you
should read the "Mahabharata".

318
00:54:07,005 --> 00:54:08,401
Which Bharat?

319
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:12,498
Nothing. Get ready.
We've got to leave soon.

320
00:54:31,133 --> 00:54:35,121
Hello Sharma
- Good evening.

321
00:54:35,566 --> 00:54:38,054
Meet Mr. Bharat from
Allahabad.

322
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,827
Which place do you belong to?

323
00:54:43,396 --> 00:54:44,918
I don't know anything about India

324
00:54:45,863 --> 00:54:49,227
I forgot to tell you, there's a
letter for you in the office

325
00:55:00,427 --> 00:55:02,119
Is it a letter from my
sister-in-law, Ganga?

326
00:55:02,492 --> 00:55:05,786
It is Guruji's letter.
- What does he write?

327
00:55:06,825 --> 00:55:10,654
He has sent his regards
and thanked all of you.

328
00:55:11,324 --> 00:55:15,778
Even Om received letters
when he studied in Banaras.

329
00:55:16,088 --> 00:55:17,817
Have you never met Guruji?
- No.

330
00:55:18,521 --> 00:55:20,421
I never got an opportunity
to visit Allahabad.

331
00:55:21,455 --> 00:55:27,386
I knew only your father, he
was shot by the Britishers.

332
00:55:28,654 --> 00:55:30,050
My family lived in Lahore.

333
00:55:31,053 --> 00:55:33,107
Everything got destroyed
in the riots.

334
00:55:34,719 --> 00:55:37,114
Then I never felt like going
back to India.

335
00:55:39,018 --> 00:55:41,916
Tell me, how did you
like this club?

336
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:47,741
It's good. You said it
belonged to our countrymen.

337
00:55:48,882 --> 00:55:51,712
But there is no kinship

338
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:58,877
My foot. In India, one can see
kinship, only where there's hunger.

339
00:55:59,079 --> 00:56:00,842
What?
- What else?

340
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:04,037
Here you can see everyone happy.

341
00:56:04,743 --> 00:56:07,007
No worry for food, for
clothes.

342
00:56:10,244 --> 00:56:13,472
And in your country,
on the other hand...

343
00:56:13,844 --> 00:56:16,899
one-fourth of what your people
earn, consists of debts...

344
00:56:17,176 --> 00:56:19,403
That country belongs to you too.
- Don't insult me.

345
00:56:20,841 --> 00:56:24,638
That country that depends
on others, is not my country.

346
00:56:25,241 --> 00:56:26,500
But it belongs to me.

347
00:56:26,873 --> 00:56:31,669
May be. You call your own,
who takes help.

348
00:56:32,206 --> 00:56:34,899
But I call it my own,
who helps others.

349
00:56:35,571 --> 00:56:38,435
You people can't even earn
food enough for everyone.

350
00:56:38,738 --> 00:56:40,327
And people here have
reached the moon.

351
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:42,097
Is there any competition?

352
00:56:45,604 --> 00:56:51,262
The whole world has bowed before
those who went to the moon.

353
00:56:51,301 --> 00:56:52,459
Are you proud of bowing?

354
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:57,330
Is there anything, for which
you can be proud of?

355
00:56:57,698 --> 00:57:03,097
No, my dear boy, your country
hasn't contributed anything.

356
00:57:03,632 --> 00:57:07,723
India's contribution is zero

357
00:58:43,243 --> 00:58:46,175
Why have you stopped?
Go on.

358
01:03:41,775 --> 01:03:45,638
Darling, stop it.
Please let me sleep

359
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:51,928
Madam, years ago while
coming from India...

360
01:03:52,873 --> 01:03:54,932
I had brought this
recorder along.

361
01:03:59,738 --> 01:04:05,365
Today, again I feel like
hearing it. You go to sleep

362
01:05:41,482 --> 01:05:43,448
I was waiting for you.

363
01:05:43,782 --> 01:05:46,043
First I thought of meeting
you at the college

364
01:05:47,383 --> 01:05:49,369
You were supposed to come to the
station at 4 'O clock anyway.

365
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:51,113
So I thought I'll meet
you here itself.

366
01:05:51,448 --> 01:05:53,240
You look worried
- Yes.

367
01:05:54,013 --> 01:05:57,138
Mohan is likely to go out
for 2 days with that girl.

368
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,306
Where?

369
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:04,301
I don't know. Preeti and her
friend are likely to accompany.

370
01:06:05,611 --> 01:06:07,576
So then, let them go.

371
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:13,774
The person who told me all
this, also said that...

372
01:06:14,307 --> 01:06:24,262
...Mohan is going to
marry that girl there...

373
01:06:25,505 --> 01:06:31,402
Glory to Rama and to Krishna.

374
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:48,861
The western countries
have reached the moon

375
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:55,757
But in search of peace and God,
is now out on this path.

376
01:08:33,777 --> 01:08:39,435
See Mohan, he's enjoying and
I am doing nothing.

377
01:08:40,209 --> 01:08:44,573
Well, carry on.
- Let's get married

378
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:46,971
Why?
- Why not?

379
01:08:47,942 --> 01:08:52,397
I've already told you. I'll get
married to the one I love.

380
01:08:53,173 --> 01:08:55,298
But when will you fall in love?

381
01:08:55,673 --> 01:08:56,898
Whenever it happens.
- But when?

382
01:08:57,305 --> 01:09:00,963
What's the hurry?
- Come on. You're too slow.

383
01:09:02,005 --> 01:09:05,595
Just look at them, they met
and fell in love.

384
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:07,801
And next Sunday, they're
even getting married.

385
01:09:52,627 --> 01:09:58,854
Is he Man's father-in-law?
- What is she saying, son?

386
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:02,521
Nothing, I was explaining your
relation with Mohan.

387
01:10:06,592 --> 01:10:17,646
Please save my daughter's life.
I beg of you!

388
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:24,349
He is begging for the
happiness of his daughter.

389
01:10:41,616 --> 01:10:44,446
Let me think.

390
01:10:48,048 --> 01:10:52,844
Don't worry.
Everything will be O.K.

391
01:11:03,011 --> 01:11:10,500
Thank you, here's your beer.
Cheers...

392
01:11:13,542 --> 01:11:17,166
In the last few days, Christina's
behavior has changed

393
01:11:17,905 --> 01:11:19,065
Why? What happened?

394
01:11:19,674 --> 01:11:23,901
She says she wants to
get married in a temple

395
01:11:25,271 --> 01:11:26,169
What?

396
01:11:27,638 --> 01:11:31,332
Here, there are few
crazy Englishmen...

397
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:34,064
...who want to convert
to Hinduism.

398
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:37,432
They have even built a temple
of Lord Krishna.

399
01:11:37,837 --> 01:11:41,962
And Christina wants to get
married there.

400
01:11:43,135 --> 01:11:47,066
I feel ashamed to tell my
friends that...

401
01:11:47,434 --> 01:11:49,989
...I'm getting married
in a temple.

402
01:12:57,051 --> 01:12:58,641
This is your wife?

403
01:13:11,314 --> 01:13:12,804
Get her back.

404
01:13:13,550 --> 01:13:17,538
I'll strike him in the same
manner as he did.

405
01:13:17,882 --> 01:13:21,742
No, tell him even today, her
husband is God for her.

406
01:13:22,379 --> 01:13:24,971
And Indians don't
kick their Gods.

407
01:13:27,045 --> 01:13:33,135
She's my daughter.
I'll bear her tears

408
01:13:34,845 --> 01:13:40,364
But, just once, embrace this
little son of yours.

409
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:09,440
My dear daughter, in which
language shall I thank you

410
01:16:10,041 --> 01:16:11,562
He says...

411
01:16:12,841 --> 01:16:19,930
I've understood, by his faith,
his eyes and his tears.

412
01:16:20,606 --> 01:16:23,766
A human can always understand
the language of humanity.

413
01:16:25,005 --> 01:16:32,165
She says, a human being can
understand, language on humanity

414
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:47,189
Let's go.

415
01:16:51,798 --> 01:17:00,994
Come to India.

416
01:17:16,894 --> 01:17:20,154
Good Luck.
- Bye.

417
01:17:56,918 --> 01:17:59,941
I'm calling from India Club.
Is Mr. Sharma there?

418
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:02,409
He hasn't returned yet

419
01:18:02,883 --> 01:18:05,246
Sir, it's one o'clock in the
night and the club is closed.

420
01:18:05,649 --> 01:18:07,672
But Preeti is still here.

421
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:10,744
Don't worry. I'll take her

422
01:18:12,513 --> 01:18:17,707
Pardon?
- I'll take her

423
01:18:24,145 --> 01:18:27,075
No.
- What happened?

424
01:18:29,145 --> 01:18:36,100
That's because, I don't love you.

425
01:18:36,875 --> 01:18:45,500
Then whom do you love?
- No one.

426
01:18:50,474 --> 01:19:00,701
But Bharat is a good friend.

427
01:19:16,265 --> 01:19:19,459
There's nobody better than me.

428
01:19:20,765 --> 01:19:22,232
Not today.

429
01:20:20,351 --> 01:20:25,045
Leave me alone.
For God's sake, leave me.

430
01:22:10,093 --> 01:22:15,153
Thank you very much

431
01:24:18,499 --> 01:24:23,158
My good friends, I'll learn it
properly from my teacher...

432
01:24:23,499 --> 01:24:27,589
...then I'll teach you

433
01:24:33,264 --> 01:24:38,250
Lord Rama is the king
of kings.

434
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:44,559
His wife, Sita, the purest
of the pure.

435
01:24:56,757 --> 01:25:07,780
Speak their names
In reverent prayer.

436
01:26:37,802 --> 01:26:40,461
My son is improving after
staying in your company.

437
01:26:40,834 --> 01:26:44,130
And if you wish, you can
even improve Preeti's life.

438
01:26:45,332 --> 01:26:46,820
I don't understand.

439
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:51,724
It's not the children's fault

440
01:26:53,530 --> 01:26:55,555
I had forgotten my culture.

441
01:26:57,663 --> 01:27:03,594
You came, now slowly I have
begun to recollect the past.

442
01:27:05,463 --> 01:27:06,984
And that I have remembered all.

443
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:13,618
I don't just want to be a witness
in my daughter's wedding...

444
01:27:13,858 --> 01:27:16,053
...just by signing

445
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:23,252
Son, parents give away their
daughter in marriage, right?

446
01:27:24,255 --> 01:27:24,880
Uncle

447
01:27:26,858 --> 01:27:31,651
I know, Preeti is not
the dream which...

448
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:36,185
...you and Ganga sister
must have seen.

449
01:27:37,489 --> 01:27:39,179
But it also is true...

450
01:27:40,087 --> 01:27:43,679
that when the flowing
water from the path...

451
01:27:43,954 --> 01:27:47,680
...merges with the Ganges, it
gets the virtues of the Ganges

452
01:27:51,819 --> 01:28:00,079
Although, I'm like your father
I modestly ask you...

453
01:28:01,182 --> 01:28:16,014
Uncle, you have full right
to decide about me...

454
01:28:16,512 --> 01:28:21,307
...and you may write the same
to my mother and Guruji.

455
01:28:22,077 --> 01:28:29,134
I was sure about it.
Take this letter.

456
01:28:30,143 --> 01:28:32,231
I know you won't refuse
their bidding.

457
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:01,262
Thank you very much.

458
01:29:14,366 --> 01:29:16,525
How was the food?
- Is this called food?

459
01:29:17,334 --> 01:29:18,355
Then was it not food?

460
01:29:19,032 --> 01:29:23,361
Food should consist of bread of
maize, mustard curry...

461
01:29:25,395 --> 01:29:26,293
My mouth is watering

462
01:29:27,230 --> 01:29:32,558
How will you know, if you've
not eaten it?

463
01:29:36,794 --> 01:29:42,056
May God protect you.

464
01:29:43,726 --> 01:29:51,885
You and your Indian God.
Now walk in English style.
