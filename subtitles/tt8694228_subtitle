1
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,960
Did Sir reach?
- He reached early in the morning.

2
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,500
Will this be trouble?

3
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,170
He's really worked up.

4
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,330
The deceased is Johnny,
from Irinjalakkuda.

5
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,210
A medium range businessman who makes return
trips to Dubai, once every two months.

6
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,710
He was on his way home,
from the airport.

7
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,460
What do you think?

8
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,500
He is a carrier?

9
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,500
The car which was parked there during
the incident, was taken from here.

10
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,080
I don't remember much.

11
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:38,170
You don't remember?

12
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,920
Do you give cars
so irresponsibly?

13
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,290
There wasn't much bargaining.

14
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,170
He took it for a test drive.

15
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,870
He didn't come back.

16
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,080
I've given a complaint
to the police.

17
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,920
And...

18
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,670
Sir, don't try to threaten me.

19
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,960
It's been quite long since
I started this job.

20
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,370
It hasn't been very long
since I started this job.

21
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,330
Put him in our car.

22
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,330
Sir...

23
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,540
No, sir.

24
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
It was Johnny who came.

25
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,620
The one who is with
Adat Georgettan.

26
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,620
You know him, right sir?

27
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,420
Around 30 cases were captured
in the past one month alone.

28
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:27,500
Per day, around 100 kilos of
gold goes out from here legally.

29
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,080
And much more, illegally.

30
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,750
The profit is quite less
in this gold business.

31
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,870
Since its a business with less profit,

32
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
what do we do?

33
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,580
We'll find ways to
increase the profit.

34
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:41,960
Yes.

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,790
The biggest gold merchants of India,
are in Kerala.

36
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,920
In the shops in Thrissur & Ernakulam alone,

37
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,920
around 150-200 kilos of
gold are sold per day.

38
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,960
Where does this extra
gold come from?

39
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:02,420
That's where the roles of people
like Johnny come into play.

40
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,120
Johnny who was a carrier for Adat,
did that job for someone else.

41
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,250
They finished him off,
and took the gold.

42
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,500
This is a warning for
many people, as well.

43
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,920
We may not be able to stand
up against Adat George, sir.

44
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,870
Let's try....

45
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,580
if we can!

46
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,040
Georgetta, move your car.

47
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,829
The boys don't know
how much it is worth.

48
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,830
They will ruin it.

49
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,870
Yeah right!

50
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,920
Then they will know what I'm worth.

51
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,250
I want to see which player would
dare to kick the ball to my car!

52
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,710
Move the car.
The boys are really naughty.

53
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,040
If they say that they
will kick, they will.

54
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,290
Ask him to call foul.

55
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,580
Shouldn't you play carefully?

56
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,710
Or else, we'll have to
come for the penalty.

57
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
You're new, right?

58
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,670
Come to my office.

59
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:07,580
Don't count me among those who come
to your office to enjoy your feasts.

60
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,210
Get into the car.

61
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,580
Move your car, sir.

62
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,670
Let me play.

63
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,000
It's a business that my
forefathers started.

64
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:18,330
Not just you, even if your
father comes and tells me,

65
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,370
I will spit at you saying 'Get
lost, you watch-dog in Khaki'.

66
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,460
Why are you so arrogant?

67
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:27,830
Don't show me your attitude of
selling that shit-coloured metal.

68
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,080
Get into the car.

69
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,290
Get going, sir.

70
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,710
Go!

71
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,250
Hey!

72
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,830
Sreenivasan,

73
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,170
this is not Tamil Nadu,
to finish him off in an encounter.

74
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,420
You won't be able to bear
George's counter attack.

75
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:10,960
Sir, I have statements
against him.

76
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,790
I will present him
before the Magistrate.

77
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:28,290
Sreenivasan is from Tamil Nadu.

78
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,250
He doesn't know the
usual procedure here.

79
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:35,250
You should have
acted accordingly.

80
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,210
Now your fate is
to suffer for it.

81
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:42,080
If he has done something
foolish, please forgive him.

82
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,330
I have never been
drenched in the rain.

83
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,420
Let alone the raindrops
from the tree.

84
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,750
Come!

85
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,000
You also sit.

86
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,460
Jerry, what are you doing?

87
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,210
Eat your food properly.

88
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:49,080
You can be a powerful businessman like
your dad, only if you eat food properly.

89
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,710
I don't want to be a businessman.

90
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,080
Then?

91
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,920
I want to be a police officer.

92
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,330
'Death will come one day'

93
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:31,040
'Remember, oh man'

94
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,500
'Your actions in this lifetime
would follow you'

95
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,040
'Perform good deeds'

96
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,960
'Without being lazy'

97
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,750
'Death will come one day'

98
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,250
'Remember, oh man'

99
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,960
'Your actions in this lifetime
would follow you'

100
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,289
'Perform good deeds'

101
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,580
'Without being lazy'

102
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,710
Three among the four policemen who went to
arrest George Peter that day, were killed..

103
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,420
Including Sreenivasan sir.

104
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,250
They used to get things
done with bribes.

105
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,420
But now, they get it done
with their physical might.

106
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,710
It's George Peter who
controls everything.

107
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:36,830
I am waiting for my death now.

108
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,080
We can't do anything, sir.

109
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,120
Let me see if I can do something.

110
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,920
Sreenivasan sir also
said the same thing.

111
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,620
Good quality Garcinia
is not available now.

112
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,420
We have to buy coriander and chilly
and get them crushed ourselves.

113
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,370
Mom is particular about that.

114
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,620
So whatever dish I make,
it will have that quality.

115
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,960
So it's not my special
culinary skill or anything.

116
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,580
I'll call you later then.

117
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,620
If the dish is good,
send some here.

118
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,420
Hey!

119
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:17,370
What do we feed you here?

120
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Sir...

121
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,040
Haven't I told you not to call me sir?

122
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,920
Georgetta...

123
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,080
That's it.

124
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,170
Now tell me.
What do we feed you here?

125
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,000
Georgetta, forgive me.

126
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,460
It's red rice!

127
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,250
Didn't you just show the arrogance of getting
first class Palakkad red rice to eat?

128
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
Georgetta...

129
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,870
I didn't have any other way
to get my sister married.

130
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,170
That's why I carried gold away from
here in my pocket, little by little.

131
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,580
And did your sister get married?

132
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,710
Yes.

133
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,080
It's over?
Why didn't you call me then?

134
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:43,290
It's not a sin that can't
be absolved with a prayer.

135
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,460
There's a fasting this evening.

136
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,420
'Death will come one day'

137
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,370
'Remember, oh man'

138
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:00,620
'Your actions in this lifetime
would follow you'

139
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,920
'Perform good deeds'

140
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,580
'Without being lazy'

141
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,369
'Death will come one day'

142
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,620
'Remember, oh man'

143
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,040
Both the deceased used to
kill and steal together.

144
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,920
Now they can be buried together.

145
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,210
There would be people to
question this, right?

146
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,250
Definitely.

147
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:38,670
This is only a breeze.

148
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,210
The storm is yet to come.

149
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
Let's see.

150
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,710
The blade from this batch.
Whom did you give it to?

151
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,420
I don't really note that here.

152
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,960
I want to know who
exactly bought this.

153
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:05,420
Apart from hospitals, some nursing homes,
and some practicing doctors also buy this.

154
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,750
I need the list of those doctors.

155
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,420
That will be quite difficult

156
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,040
I am ready to face that difficulty.

157
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,330
The loss is not only for you.

158
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,330
If you intend on killing
each other for this...

159
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,210
there won't be anything left.

160
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,420
I don't trust you.

161
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:31,620
Hey Marco!

162
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:34,790
If I have done it,
I will admit it with pride.

163
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,040
My b♪♪♪♪ are strong
enough for that.

164
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,540
Abraham, enough!

165
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,000
Marco has come here to talk,
upon my request.

166
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,960
It's out of his respect for Davichayan.

167
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,040
This Davis doesn't have to kill
George, to expand my business.

168
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,710
The Mangalorean who killed
your dad, Marco Sr....

169
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,210
To shoot him right on his chest,

170
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,870
George came to me for help!

171
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,870
When the war starts, George used
to hold his hands like this,

172
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,750
and show that he's about to begin.

173
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:10,500
And when it's over, he used to
raise both his hands and laugh.

174
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,830
Then who is it?

175
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:14,330
For what?

176
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
That's what.

177
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,210
That's what we need to find out.

178
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,250
All of us need to know
who killed George.

179
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,120
Somebody is trying to
be more evil than us.

180
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,580
Shall I leave, Ichaya?
- Okay.

181
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,620
If you have any brains,
this is the time to use it.

182
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:52,290
If you finish off Marco,
nothing would be over.

183
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:54,170
What's your wage like?

184
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,710
This is not the time
to measure my loyalty.

185
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,000
Think properly
about what I said.

186
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,170
I need both of you.

187
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,960
That doesn't mean that we should
spare the one who killed your son.

188
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,420
How was this situation created?

189
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,080
Who is behind this?

190
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,040
Davichayan killed 3 people
in the middle of the road.

191
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,920
He thought no would give
a witness statement.

192
00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:27,250
But he was wrong.

193
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:29,870
Some Johnny from Pala,
gave a witness statement.

194
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,250
He bumped him off.

195
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,870
Even though he took the
case to the Supreme Court,

196
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
he got trapped.

197
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,500
Now he's on life imprisonment.

198
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,870
He's in a sanatorium, claiming that
he's under treatment for mental health.

199
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,920
He rules sitting there.

200
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,290
The Abraham who died now,
is his eldest son.

201
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,920
It is said that God calls good
people back early, right?

202
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,420
Considering that,

203
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,960
the last one who should
be leaving this earth,

204
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,080
has died now.

205
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,370
William..
Heartfelt condolences to you.

206
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,960
Wasn't it Marco who did it?

207
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,460
No.

208
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,080
Eesa.

209
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,870
Eagle Eesa.

210
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,000
I've heard a lot about you.

211
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,250
If the game is interesting,

212
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,460
cheer for the players,
without taking sides.

213
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,080
If you are intending
on enforcing your law,

214
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,080
we're not the old police officers who
would enjoy watching it from a distance.

215
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,290
We don't need a referee here.

216
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,790
Let's go.

217
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,250
He came during the rain.

218
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,710
On his neck,

219
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:46,920
there was a chain, with
Saint Mikhael's locket.

220
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,540
I need a list of doctors from
all the hospitals in the city.

221
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,080
Especially a person who wasn't on duty,

222
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,420
on last Monday afternoon.

223
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:59,210
A man who predominantly uses his left hand,

224
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,580
than his right.

225
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,170
A born left-hander.

226
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,790
A leftie!

227
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,250
This Patrick is a combination
of both Narada and Shakuni.

228
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,670
He has planned some operation.

229
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:15,790
Have you brought your gun?
- Sir.

230
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,960
It is quite troublesome to
follow someone like this.

231
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,330
The most valuable head
next in line, is his.

232
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,620
Francy...

233
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,870
No!
My calculations haven't gone wrong.

234
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,420
Our people are all around.

235
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,790
Whoever he is,

236
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:36,540
he will come in search of him.

237
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,080
When and how, is
what we don't know.

238
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,210
I'll call you later.

239
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,830
Come on, man!

240
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,920
I am waiting.

241
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:03,620
Did you see all those cars?

242
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,040
They are all his people.

243
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,330
But, there's one rat among them.

244
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,210
Patrick!

245
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:27,620
You bloody!
What the f@♪$!

246
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
Who was it?

247
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Did you see him?

248
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:35,710
Tell me.

249
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,710
You're taking my dying declaration?

250
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,330
Yes. I saw him.

251
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,040
I saw him very clearly.

252
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,080
Then tell me.

253
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,120
First you save my life.

254
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:47,710
Otherwise, I know...

255
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,420
You will finish me off.

256
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,870
Patrick, who is it?

257
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,710
Tell me.
- Obey what I said.

258
00:23:56,830 --> 00:23:59,540
Bring the sketch artist and the
Magistrate to record the statement,

259
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,749
immediately to the Medical College.
- Nothing will happen to you.

260
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,170
Not to the Medical College.
- Sir.

261
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,870
To the best hospital in this city.

262
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,170
Okay sir.

263
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,249
Send all this people away.
- Okay.

264
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,670
Each and every corner should be
under our control. - Yes sir.

265
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,620
Don't let anyone inside
without checking them.

266
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,210
Specially check the vehicles
that come through the gate.

267
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,710
Patrick, who has done this to you?

268
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,540
Come on, tell me.

269
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:41,040
Patrick, I'm asking you.
Who has done this to you?

270
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:43,290
Come on!

271
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,500
Come on! Bloody hell, Patrick.
Tell me who has done this to you?

272
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,040
You should step outside, please.

273
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,620
Okay.

274
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,370
This whole place is
under our control, sir.

275
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,210
We can't trust even the shadow around us.

276
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,420
When there's light, it will disappear.

277
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,750
'Mikhael'

278
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:47,870
Jenny!

279
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,960
That girl is really strong.

280
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,420
If you can't, tell me.

281
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,460
Take a decision.

282
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,710
Hey! Keep quiet.

283
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,500
The one who won
should be praised.

284
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:57,460
When the fallen rises up,
the winner should fall.

285
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,080
You can do it, Jenny.

286
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,540
Come on!
- Jenny!

287
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,869
Attack through the right side.

288
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:02,870
She's a left hander.

289
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,330
Right side will always be weak.

290
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,500
Take it as an advantage.
- Mike, please.

291
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,290
You escaped because
of pure luck.

292
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:09,460
You know how many competitions
I've won, when I was young?

293
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,790
Mike, you're such a braggart!

294
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,830
You came with me and made me lose
the little confidence I had.

295
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,040
Well...

296
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,790
I said it so that you
don't get injured.

297
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,290
I'm a doctor, right?

298
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:21,250
Why don't you do something
that you actually can?

299
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,620
I'm really tired.

300
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:23,830
I have to sleep.

301
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,870
Drive carefully.

302
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,670
Oh!

303
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,290
Don't teach me how to drive.

304
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,250
As if you're some old aunty!

305
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,170
This is why you got beaten up.

306
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,870
Oops!

307
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,920
Mike!

308
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,790
Who's that?

309
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,726
Where are you looking when
you're driving? You loser!

310
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,750
Come on, hit me.

311
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:05,830
Hit me on my chest!

312
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:07,419
Have you told anyone at home?

313
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,580
If you don't look at the
road while driving...

314
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,540
I'll kick you and rip you apart.
Got it?

315
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,830
Such losers!

316
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,460
It was his mistake, right?

317
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Mike!

318
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,210
Thanks.

319
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,670
For bringing me here alive.

320
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,750
My dear...

321
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,370
Congrats.
- Thank you.

322
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,580
Aren't you coming in?

323
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,460
No.

324
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,000
This has been going
on for so long.

325
00:33:58,210 --> 00:33:59,870
Who's a stranger to you here?

326
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,290
Whom are you being
so adamant against?

327
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,920
I'm not interfering
in your life, Mummy.

328
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:11,080
I like to see you happy.

329
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,670
Like that, let me be adamant.

330
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:16,250
For Jenny, Antony is
like her own dad.

331
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,750
But he's not our own dad, right?

332
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,040
Brother-in-law!

333
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,040
Hey! Are you a doctor?

334
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,080
What the hell? You've been
scribbling for so long!

335
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,830
Examine him, man!

336
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,209
Who are you?

337
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,170
You'll examine him only
if you know who I am?

338
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,330
Who let him inside?

339
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,370
I don't need anyone's
help to come in here.

340
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,500
Examine him, man!

341
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,960
Chetta, he has a breathing problem.

342
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,249
Can't you see that we're giving him Oxygen?
Please go outside.

343
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,040
Aren't there any other
qualified doctors here?

344
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,249
Is he the one to bring death
to my brother in law?

345
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,500
Hey! You go outside!

346
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,080
I am the doctor here, right?
- Is it?

347
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,080
Then you go outside.
- I'll go.

348
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,370
My second wife has only one brother.

349
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,169
And he's lying here,
waiting for his death.

350
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,330
My dear brother in law.

351
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,120
Bro!

352
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,420
Don't just keep staring,
and at least take an X Ray!

353
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,120
He is calling me.

354
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,710
What is it, bro?

355
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,830
Please go outside,

356
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,170
you moron!

357
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,670
What is your disease actually?

358
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,790
I have cough.

359
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,370
Hey! Don't cough like this.
Isn't this a hospital?

360
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,620
When did it start?

361
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,170
It's been one month.

362
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,580
Can't you see some other
doctor for such diseases?

363
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,710
What else is wrong?

364
00:35:57,830 --> 00:35:59,870
My foot pains, when I walk.

365
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,370
Let's do an MRI scan.

366
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,750
MRI is very good for that.

367
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,580
Michael, come with me.

368
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,540
You lack responsibility.

369
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,330
When someone comes to casualty,

370
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,210
haven't I told you to prescribe
the needful tests and scans?

371
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,080
Yes, but only if it's
needed, right sir?

372
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,330
Michael, son...

373
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,080
if you can prescribe it, do it.

374
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,670
Casualty has a target.

375
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,290
If others can do it,
you can also do it.

376
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:35,420
Otherwise, this James will have
to interfere in your matter.

377
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,580
That might not be good for you.

378
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,959
By painting everyone
else in a bad light,

379
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,869
one person alone needn't
be all truthful here.

380
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:42,870
Got it?

381
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,580
A Karate practitioner
is an artist as well.

382
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:02,210
He can conquer not only someone's
body, but his mind too.

383
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:04,040
Haven't you heard of Jackie Chan?

384
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,620
Bruce Lee?

385
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,830
Jet Li?

386
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Tony Jaa!

387
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:14,750
Your biggest fortune is that you
got someone like me as your coach.

388
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,580
As a sportsman,

389
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,420
you can make money,

390
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,920
gain fame and respect,

391
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,620
and you'll get several accolades.

392
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,170
Only I know the ways to achieve them,

393
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,370
and that makes me unique
from other coaches.

394
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:31,016
Even after knowing all this,
why didn't you get any of that, Chetta?

395
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,460
Chettan?
- No. Sir.

396
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,210
Sir, you'll hear a mouthful from me.

397
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,749
Breaking my son's arm
is called practice?

398
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,460
What happens here?
I want to know.

399
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,540
Well, it happened
between the practice.

400
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,999
In fact, this is the first time.

401
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,120
No.
It's Gerard.

402
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,580
Gerard did it deliberately.

403
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:48,790
He has a grudge against me.

404
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:50,960
Who is this Gerard?

405
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,170
Gerard Peter.

406
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,290
You and your stupid
monkey-style haircut!

407
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,500
I've warned you several times.

408
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,249
Haven't I told you that there's no place
for personal rivalry during practice?

409
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,250
I didn't know...

410
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,016
that his arm would break
with just a touch.

411
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,370
I'll punch you!

412
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:10,620
And it was not deliberate?
- No.

413
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:14,080
Master, Gerard behaves
indecently towards girls.

414
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,120
He wants to fight
with girls, it seems.

415
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,960
He speaks indecently towards
Maria and Riya.

416
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,290
This is your final warning.

417
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
Dear...

418
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,170
When will you reach back?

419
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,870
Don't roam around
too much at night.

420
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,790
He doesn't even know to
take care of himself.

421
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,620
You have your mobile
phone, right?

422
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,669
Don't find faults
with Mike, Chachan.

423
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,080
I have my phone with me.
Bye.

424
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,250
Bye.

425
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,750
Oops.

426
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,540
You...

427
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,580
I'll sort you out today.

428
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,620
Stop there!

429
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,790
Stop there!

430
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,670
I'll finish you today.
- Come! Come!

431
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,210
Stop there!
- This way!

432
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,290
Hey you!

433
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,370
You...

434
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,080
If I see you in this Panchayat
ever again, I'll break your legs.

435
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,790
He's messing with
this Valavil Varkey!

436
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,460
Why did you run?

437
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,170
Why did he hit you?

438
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,040
A politician was brought
here after an accident.

439
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,830
I gave him just one injection.

440
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,960
He died.
- Injection?

441
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,670
Hey! It's not the injection's fault.

442
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,210
It's like this in casualty.

443
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,750
The relatives of some patients,

444
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,170
will feel relieved only if
they hit the doctor.

445
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,936
These are his party workers though.

446
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,540
So it's risky to
be a doctor, huh?

447
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,790
Anyway, you could have hit him back.

448
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,960
Haven't us Christians
learnt from the Bible,

449
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,420
to show the other cheek, when
we're slapped on one cheek?

450
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:10,040
Doesn't the Bible say 'An eye for an
eye and a tooth for a tooth', as well?

451
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,210
Even Jesus had picked up a cane.

452
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:14,460
You're quite something, huh?

453
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,210
You'll get me beaten up again!

454
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,290
But it's bad to hide
after getting slapped.

455
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,710
They have left.

456
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,670
Good.

457
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,790
Why are you doing all this?

458
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,170
What?

459
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:30,370
You just came here, right doctor?
You will learn soon.

460
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,710
They didn't touch you
because you're lady.

461
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,670
Or else, you'd have
been slapped for sure.

462
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,670
If they touch me, I'll complain.

463
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,080
Even we have
associations, right?

464
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,960
However much we treat them,
God takes back 10% of the people.

465
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,330
From that, the relatives of 3%, would leave
the hospital after hitting the doctor.

466
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,370
Michael, what about the matter I asked you?

467
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,500
What matter?

468
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,789
Keep quiet, Doctor.

469
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,790
Just...

470
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,170
What did that Doctor say?

471
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,750
That she likes me, I am
handsome, 'I love you', etc.

472
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,710
She says it daily.
- Oh God!

473
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,870
What?
- Did she propose to you?

474
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:08,210
Well...

475
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,870
I get 3-4 proposals daily
in this hospital, dear.

476
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,420
Might be in your dream.

477
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,830
Anyway, I liked her.

478
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,620
You did?
- Yes.

479
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,330
You really liked her?
- Yes.

480
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,000
Then you marry her.

481
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,250
Got it?

482
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:23,330
She liked her, it seems.

483
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,920
It was a real surprise for me.
I didn't expect it at all.

484
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,290
Who? Me?

485
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:32,170
Why did you bring all this?

486
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:34,460
Can't you come without all this?
- That is Anna.

487
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,710
Where is your son?

488
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:38,790
My dream, my hope and my life.

489
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,460
For the past 3 years,

490
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,790
we have been in love.

491
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,120
You never told me that
you had a girlfriend.

492
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,420
You are yet to know
a lot about me.

493
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:49,870
I didn't like her.

494
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:53,290
Just... Jealousy!

495
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,290
One minute.
I'll be right back.

496
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:06,420
This..
- Yes. I know.

497
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,790
Jenny..
Jennifer.

498
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,170
Happy Birthday to you...

499
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,830
Happy Birthday Dear Anna!

500
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,540
Happy Birthday to you!

501
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,540
Thank you.

502
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,580
Thank you.

503
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
Will you marry me?

504
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,080
Anna, will you marry me?

505
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:47,620
What is this, Michael?

506
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,040
To spoil such a good day.

507
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,920
What are you saying?

508
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,250
You know what?

509
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,000
Varghese and I have been in
a relationship for a year.

510
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,290
Varghese?

511
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,620
Yes.

512
00:42:58,870 --> 00:42:59,870
What about us?

513
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,500
There's nothing between us.

514
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:05,210
And, I was never satisfied
in our relationship.

515
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,670
Who doesn't like a change?

516
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,920
You'll get a much
better girl than me.

517
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,670
And we will always be friends.

518
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,040
You needn't have dumped.

519
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,620
You can wipe it off later.

520
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,370
She dumped me.

521
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,040
Varghese?

522
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,870
Will it be Aju Varghese?

523
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,080
Who does she think she is?

524
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,790
My bad luck that I felt like
giving her a ring then.

525
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,250
Oh God! My money is also gone.

526
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,620
Anyway, I wasn't very
interested in this.

527
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,870
I just tried for the sake of it.

528
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:55,500
Are you sad?

529
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:57,540
Sad?

530
00:43:57,830 --> 00:43:58,869
It's good.

531
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,870
It will go away after quite some time.

532
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,460
But how could she...

533
00:44:03,250 --> 00:44:06,500
You need at least a minimum sense to
understand that girls are cheating you.

534
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:08,960
Wait and watch.

535
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,620
There won't be another
girl in my life.

536
00:44:10,790 --> 00:44:12,330
Oh no! Don't say that!

537
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,710
There are 3-4 girls who
propose daily, right?

538
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,370
You should select one from them.

539
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,420
Hey! You're overdoing it.

540
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,330
Shall we go home?

541
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,960
I'm not coming.
- Is it because Chachan is there?

542
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,330
Yeah. I'm not coming.

543
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,500
Has our papa held
me in his hands?

544
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,540
Papa's main hobby was to carry you around.

545
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,000
Ever since Papa died,

546
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,750
I feel like that I
don't have anyone.

547
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,210
All of us are there, right?

548
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,250
Me and Mummy...?

549
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,330
How did Papa die?

550
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,670
Papa, shall I drive?

551
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,290
Is that necessary?

552
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:21,250
Go! Go!

553
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,960
Slowly...

554
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,210
To the left!

555
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,460
Slowly, son..
Hold it straight.

556
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,120
Mike, a car!

557
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:00,080
It was Ichayan's fault.

558
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,830
Why did he do such
a foolishness?

559
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,830
Mike shouldn't have done that.

560
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:11,290
If he hadn't done that...

561
00:46:12,330 --> 00:46:14,120
my husband would have
been with me now.

562
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,580
He became the reason for
his own father's death.

563
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:41,170
I shouldn't have said that.

564
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,790
I gave him a feeling that,

565
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,210
it was him who ended Papa's life.

566
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,920
After that, my son
hasn't stayed with me.

567
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,080
He must have been hurt.

568
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:56,080
He never got close to anyone after that.
He didn't speak to anyone.

569
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,080
Are you an idiot?

570
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:02,459
We asked you!

571
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,000
Didn't you kill your dad?

572
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,080
I'll make him talk.

573
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,210
There's a rat amongst them.

574
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,620
Rat?

575
00:47:18,621 --> 00:47:20,120
Yes. A rat.

576
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:22,170
You are crazy.
Go to sleep.

577
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,870
Rat means, a spy.

578
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,290
The one who gives
information to the police.

579
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,540
Someone like that is calling sir
and giving him information.

580
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:33,750
Who would that be?

581
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,000
Is there any benefit
if you find him?

582
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:42,960
The investigation is happening only
according to Eesa sir's calculation.

583
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:46,370
And sir is not revealing much.

584
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,790
That means, you want to be a worker
who's bigger than the leader.

585
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,370
Your tongue is a disaster.

586
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:59,670
Otherwise, you could just hang around
with him, listening to him, right?

587
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,080
But if you want to catch the rat,
you have to become a cat.

588
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,500
That means, you should get rid of
the thought that you're a tiger.

589
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:12,210
You go to sleep.
Good night.

590
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,870
If you want to find the informer, why don't
you just check your sir's call details?

591
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,499
That's right.

592
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,790
Great! So you didn't
know all this, huh?

593
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,920
I don't think of
such simple methods.

594
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,000
You understand the seriousness
of what you're doing, right?

595
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,040
And I feel something fishy.

596
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,710
I found our killer.

597
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,420
I was in search of the rat...

598
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,210
But there's no one like that.

599
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,000
What I did must be really bad
in your point of view...

600
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,920
It's a doctor who calls you
and gives you information.

601
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,290
Dr. Michael.

602
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:24,960
A young doctor who handles the
casualty department at Star Hospital.

603
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:29,040
He called you from the location
where Patrick was shot.

604
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,960
According to my inference,
that doctor is the killer.

605
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,290
After shooting Patrick.
The doctor reached the hospital.

606
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,830
You took Patrick him to him,
in a half-dead condition.

607
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,120
He finished off
Patrick very easily.

608
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,120
His movement is clearly shown
through the mobile signals.

609
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:54,000
Michael contacts you often,
and you also contact him often.

610
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:56,330
Now tell me.

611
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,120
What's your role in this?

612
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,920
Why did you make me a
witness to this drama?

613
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,370
I underestimated you.

614
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,000
You have an investigative inquisitiveness
that's mostly found in women.

615
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,960
Otherwise, instead of
looking for the killer,

616
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:33,120
you won't look for
the informer, right?

617
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:38,249
Don't trust even your own shadow...

618
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:41,170
It will disappear as soon as light appears.
It was you who told me that.

619
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,710
Are you challenging me?
- No, sir.

620
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:50,960
I just want to know the truth.

621
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,580
A dog pees with its legs held up.

622
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:57,960
And comes back and smells it,
so that it doesn't forget its path.

623
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,920
What you're doing
right now is that.

624
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:09,370
We're going to take
Dr. Michael into our custody.

625
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,079
I've taken permission
from higher officials,

626
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,120
since I felt that you're
also involved in this.

627
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,460
If you give answers to
my doubts correctly,

628
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:19,830
I may be able to understand you.

629
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,000
To clear your doubts,

630
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:25,210
I'm not a teacher
who's teaching you.

631
00:51:26,370 --> 00:51:28,120
For smoking in a
Government office,

632
00:51:28,790 --> 00:51:30,000
you can charge a petty case.

633
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:31,920
That's all you can do now.

634
00:51:38,250 --> 00:51:39,250
Just a minute, sir.

635
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:42,870
A dog raises both its hands
and stands on its legs.

636
00:51:43,870 --> 00:51:45,580
I needn't tell you want
that is for, right?

637
00:51:48,330 --> 00:51:49,330
Sorry sir.

638
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,790
You are under
police custody now.

639
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,790
I said you have your own limitations.

640
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:04,540
Sir, you're still standing
where you were earlier.

641
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:08,710
If the Doctor is taken into custody,
things would go out of control.

642
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:11,580
Okay.

643
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,670
Freeze all actions.

644
00:52:14,870 --> 00:52:16,370
Don't take Michael into custody.

645
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:18,830
I'll tell you the whole story.

646
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,750
His story.

647
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,170
History of Mikhael.

648
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:34,830
Sir..
- Ashok!

649
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:37,250
Stop all actions for the time being.
- Okay sir.

650
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,670
Did you think that if you complain,
that Master would get rid of me?

651
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:22,920
You're a champion, right?
You beat me first.

652
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,290
Then you can be a champion!

653
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:25,540
Come.

654
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,120
Gerard!

655
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,500
Don't!

656
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,999
You're becoming weak because
you aren't eating properly.

657
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,619
Would anyone say that you're
from a good family seeing you?

658
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,750
Eat it, I say!

659
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,580
Here.
Eat this egg as well.

660
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:33,670
Eat it!

661
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,040
What happened to you?

662
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:43,580
With energy consumption...

663
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,670
being the buzzword in
developing economies...

664
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:49,500
around the world,

665
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,960
fears of an energy crisis...

666
00:55:54,330 --> 00:55:57,710
looming ahead are not
totally unfounded.

667
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,460
Gerard!

668
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,120
Silence!

669
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,290
The non-renewable nature
of fossil fuels...

670
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,670
makes complete dependence on
these for future energy needs.

671
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:15,290
A very dicey affair.

672
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:19,540
Renewable energy sources are
the best bet in this scenario.

673
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:56,120
She's not eating anything.
She doesn't want to go to class either.

674
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:57,870
What do I do?

675
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,370
What is this, Jenny?

676
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:01,710
Gerard did something foolish.

677
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:02,750
That's all, right?

678
00:58:02,790 --> 00:58:03,790
It's me...

679
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,370
He died because of me.

680
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I shouldn't have done anything.

681
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,040
No.

682
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,120
It happened that day because
Gerard hurt you, right?

683
00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:17,170
That boy's father is here.

684
00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:20,790
You don't worry, dear.

685
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:23,750
From tomorrow, be a good girl
and come to class, okay?

686
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,710
Why are you sad, dear?

687
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:49,870
Look.

688
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:51,750
He was this uncle's son, right?

689
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:54,250
But this uncle is not
being sad, right?

690
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,080
My son made a mistake.

691
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:00,870
But...

692
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:04,040
I don't understand why he
ended his life for that.

693
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:07,330
He must have been really sad.

694
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,540
He must have been humiliated.

695
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,000
He has a habit of winning everywhere.

696
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:15,170
That's why.

697
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,790
Do you think my son
would have cried then?

698
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:23,920
He must have wept before he died.

699
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:25,870
Right, dear?

700
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,750
It's not your fault, dear.

701
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:36,210
Look.

702
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,920
It's not your mistake.

703
00:59:38,370 --> 00:59:39,960
Then why are you sad?

704
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:42,830
Look.

705
00:59:43,170 --> 00:59:44,750
Be a good girl and go to school.

706
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:52,870
After going to school...

707
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,420
you should do something
for this uncle.

708
00:59:57,250 --> 00:59:58,250
Not very soon...

709
00:59:58,750 --> 00:59:59,750
You can take your time.

710
01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:04,120
Once you get back to school,
and become all active,

711
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:06,750
you should do what I say.

712
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,960
Gerard jumped, right?

713
01:00:13,870 --> 01:00:15,330
You should go to that terrace.

714
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,120
And just like he jumped,

715
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:20,460
you should also jump from there.

716
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,290
Won't you do what this uncle said?

717
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,170
I need that.

718
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:33,500
Only then I would feel relieved.

719
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,120
No one else needs to know.

720
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,960
Your mummy or step-father or anyone!

721
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,960
If you tell this to anyone....

722
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:44,250
I will kill all of them.

723
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:48,670
Won't you do this for uncle, dear?

724
01:00:50,290 --> 01:00:51,290
Not for me...

725
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:53,460
For Gerard!

726
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:04,710
Scarcity and the need for water
conservation and management.

727
01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:08,120
Given the abundance and
renewability of water,

728
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:13,040
it is difficult to imagine that we
may suffer from water scarcity.

729
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:16,329
The moment we speak
of water shortages,

730
01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:20,870
we immediately associate
it with regions having

731
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:24,670
low rainfall, or those
that are drought prone.

732
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:29,000
We instantly visualize the
deserts of Rajasthan...

733
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:31,710
and women balancing 'Matka's.

734
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:11,290
He's following the
child and scaring her....

735
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:13,120
Waiting outside the
house at night....

736
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,960
Following her
everywhere she goes...

737
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,120
You should do something.

738
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:18,870
If this is the case, she's saying
that she won't go to school.

739
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,210
She's quite petrified.

740
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:22,420
Why is he scaring my child like this?

741
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,460
What wrong did she do for that?

742
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:28,250
I need to talk to Jennifer.

743
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,580
What does he tell you, dear?

744
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,330
That I should also jump from the
school terrace, like Gerard.

745
01:02:49,420 --> 01:02:50,920
I am scared of him.

746
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,540
Why are you so scared, Jennifer?

747
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:56,250
He said that he would kill Mummy
& Chachan if I don't jump.

748
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:58,120
Hey!

749
01:02:58,370 --> 01:02:59,620
He is a mad man.

750
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:08,040
He's saying that Gerard is
waiting for you in heaven.

751
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:11,040
So, just obey what
that uncle told you.

752
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:28,960
What happened to you?

753
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:30,830
Nothing.

754
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,370
It is that boy's fate.

755
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:34,500
Why should you be sad for that?

756
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,370
It's not all that.
- Then?

757
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,790
What's the point in telling you?
Will you be able to help me, Mike?

758
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:41,960
It's my fault.

759
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:43,250
It's because of me.

760
01:03:43,670 --> 01:03:46,080
What all are you saying?
What mistake did you do?

761
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:57,250
Jenny...

762
01:03:58,790 --> 01:03:59,790
Let's go.

763
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,960
Class is about to start.

764
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,080
Did that girl jump, sir?

765
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:51,790
How long has it been
since you came here?

766
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:53,080
To the crime branch?

767
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,830
It's been 2 months.

768
01:05:55,370 --> 01:05:57,330
I still haven't
understood you so far.

769
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:01,620
I demanded you to be in my team,
because your records were impressive.

770
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,830
I always have that respect for you, sir.
- Yeah right.

771
01:06:09,830 --> 01:06:11,250
Hello!
- Did you catch the rat?

772
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:14,120
Sir, I'll be right back.
It's my wife.

773
01:06:16,330 --> 01:06:18,040
Don't believe whatever he's saying.

774
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,620
See that you don't get trapped.

775
01:06:19,870 --> 01:06:22,290
Listen to it fully.
And see to it that you don't get hurt,

776
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,710
and that you don't
lose your job.

777
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:25,620
If you need anything, call me.

778
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,670
I'll tell you the rest of the story.

779
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:48,500
Jenny!

780
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:25,040
I've sent your share
to your account, mom.

781
01:07:25,870 --> 01:07:28,620
Business hasn't been great this month.
Don't shout at me for that.

782
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:30,460
Why has business been dull?

783
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:33,210
My son died very recently.

784
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:34,919
I couldn't take care.

785
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,500
Your son?
Or the business?

786
01:07:36,580 --> 01:07:37,580
Both!

787
01:07:38,330 --> 01:07:41,010
Even if I have to kill someone,
I'll get my business back to normal.

788
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:44,470
I have to give a feast to the poor
kids at St. Antony's this time.

789
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:45,539
That's an offering I made.

790
01:07:45,540 --> 01:07:47,620
For what gain have you
made this offering for?

791
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,460
When I see my Jerry eating something...

792
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,670
I used to feel really happy, mom.

793
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,000
If I buy something for him,

794
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,710
if he likes it,

795
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:04,170
my heart would fill with pride.

796
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:06,670
Then I would ask him,

797
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,120
'Did you like it, son?'

798
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:10,790
Then I'll ask again.

799
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,500
'Did you like what I bought you, son?'

800
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:16,040
Then he would nod
yes, in return.

801
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:18,870
Then I would ask again.

802
01:08:20,170 --> 01:08:21,170
'Did you like it?'

803
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,290
Then he would get furious.

804
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:27,170
'My dear dad! Please shut up!'

805
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:30,040
It's really nice to
hear him say that, mom.

806
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:34,290
Only...

807
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:36,870
Only when we lose something,

808
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,250
we would realize the value of
everything we've achieved.

809
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:43,580
I was sitting here and
crying all this while.

810
01:08:44,330 --> 01:08:45,330
I'm fed up!

811
01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:47,290
I'm fed up of crying!

812
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:50,830
Didn't you ask me, mom?

813
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:54,330
For what gain am I
feeding those poor kids?

814
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:58,420
You can realize it gradually.

815
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,040
Mom!

816
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:07,420
Mom!

817
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,540
One day, if I die suddenly,

818
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:14,870
what would you do, mom?

819
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:44,460
Chachan!

820
01:09:44,710 --> 01:09:45,790
What is it?

821
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:46,960
What is it, dear?

822
01:09:58,710 --> 01:09:59,710
There's no one here.

823
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,330
I know that you're angry with me.

824
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,790
I'm a cursed woman.

825
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,290
Please forgive...

826
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:19,000
all your Mummy's mistakes.

827
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:22,170
I've hurt you...

828
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:25,620
I've hurt you a lot, my son!

829
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,540
Nothing was on purpose.

830
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,620
Let's celebrate this Christmas
together at our house.

831
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,920
I need you!

832
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,210
We need you, Mike!

833
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:51,290
Are you even listening to me?

834
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:55,080
Please forgive your
mother's sins, son.

835
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:56,539
Please stop it.

836
01:11:56,540 --> 01:11:58,290
I don't want to hear all this.
- Forgive me.

837
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:26,330
It's not my mistake.

838
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:27,960
I know.

839
01:12:28,580 --> 01:12:29,710
They will kill us.

840
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,330
Jenny & Mummy must have
been really scared.

841
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:17,040
Jenny is saying that he
would kill all of us.

842
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:19,210
Aren't you scared, Michael?

843
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:20,830
It's not fear.

844
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,170
I don't know what to do..
- Doctor, an accident case.

845
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:56,790
'Let's celebrate this Christmas
together at our house'.

846
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:01,540
'I need you!'

847
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,460
'We need you, Mike!'

848
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:11,420
'Please forgive your
mother's sins, son'.

849
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:02,369
'At the shore of the lake of pain'

850
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:07,790
'Crying all alone'

851
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:15,920
'There is no one else with me,
on this path that is turning dark'

852
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:25,080
'Your face is filled with tears'

853
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:34,830
'Which shore would
offer you solace now?'

854
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:44,540
'The heart has become
as thin as a raindrop'

855
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:54,290
'Grief that's burning in
the ember of memories'

856
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:01,120
If Ancy was alive,

857
01:17:01,790 --> 01:17:03,920
she would have been really
happy that you came here.

858
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:06,420
The happiness of our close ones.

859
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:08,960
We should get it done as
soon as we can.

860
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:11,460
Or else, we don't know what
may happen tomorrow...

861
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:15,920
No one would be able to
replace your parents.

862
01:17:16,540 --> 01:17:17,540
Right, Mike?

863
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:41,460
'Her wounded mind that has
only sweet words for me'

864
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:51,170
'As I reject them,
her eyes tear up'

865
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:59,670
'My mother's heart was melting'

866
01:17:59,710 --> 01:18:07,710
'As I stood there like a statue,
unaware of it'

867
01:18:11,790 --> 01:18:14,670
I'm not able to do
anything without Mummy.

868
01:18:15,460 --> 01:18:17,620
It feels like Mummy has
gone somewhere for a while.

869
01:18:18,750 --> 01:18:20,250
Mummy used to say...

870
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:22,249
'If something happens to you,

871
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,330
Mike will come to your rescue,
like Mikhael, the guardian angel'

872
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:34,000
'There is no one else with me,
on this path that is turning dark'

873
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:43,170
'Your face is filled with tears'

874
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:52,960
'Which shore would
offer you solace now?'

875
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:30,210
He is destroying our family.

876
01:20:30,920 --> 01:20:32,040
Didn't Jenny tell you?

877
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:35,210
That he used to threaten that
he would kill Mummy & Antony?

878
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:37,790
It was a brown car that hit her.

879
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:39,620
It was an accident.

880
01:20:40,040 --> 01:20:41,580
There's no evidence
to prove who it is.

881
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:46,370
Both you and I know who it is.

882
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:49,370
George Peter.

883
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,290
I can't do anything to him.

884
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:54,620
Then why are you playing the clown,
claiming to protect the people?

885
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:57,040
Go and fall at his feet, kiddo.

886
01:20:57,420 --> 01:20:59,670
Fall at his feet and
request him to spare you.

887
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,420
I can't do anything.

888
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:03,000
If you have to do something,

889
01:21:03,370 --> 01:21:06,370
you need to be sure about your father's
name that's displayed on your chest.

890
01:21:13,460 --> 01:21:14,710
Swearing at my father?

891
01:21:35,790 --> 01:21:37,040
You're feeling weak, right?

892
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:38,710
You can go back in the police vehicle.

893
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:49,170
It's a painkiller.
Buy & have it.

894
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:05,540
I'll prescribe one with a
higher dose for you, soon.

895
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:20,370
I don't want to torture anyone.

896
01:22:21,540 --> 01:22:23,080
I want to live peacefully.

897
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:26,370
But they are not allowing
me to live peacefully!

898
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,370
I don't have any grudge
against that girl.

899
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,250
But when I close my eyes,

900
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:33,210
my Jerry comes and tells me,

901
01:22:33,620 --> 01:22:34,620
'Dad!'

902
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:37,460
'Make her jump from there,
just like I did'.

903
01:22:39,330 --> 01:22:40,620
What's wrong with me, doctor?

904
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:42,290
You're mad.

905
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:43,620
Yes.

906
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:46,420
And I know that better
than anyone else.

907
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:49,080
That's why I come
to see you, doctor.

908
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:53,790
I don't have the medicine to
stop you from torturing people.

909
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:55,670
You just have to
console me, doctor.

910
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:56,920
Counseling.

911
01:22:57,500 --> 01:22:59,420
I'll manage for one week
with that peace of mind.

912
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:03,040
Try to approach life
with peace and restraint.

913
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,620
No one can return what you lost.

914
01:23:06,040 --> 01:23:08,960
Read the Bible once in a while.
Go to the Church.

915
01:23:09,290 --> 01:23:13,370
When I read the Bible, I'm reminded of
those Jew rascals who crucified Lord Jesus.

916
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,210
I'll lose my peace of mind.

917
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,500
What they did was wrong, right?

918
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:20,790
George, pray to God.

919
01:23:21,040 --> 01:23:22,330
You will get peace of mind.

920
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:23,920
He will show you the right path.

921
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:25,710
If we say that God exists,

922
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:27,880
we can't reject the presence
of Satan too, right?

923
01:23:28,790 --> 01:23:30,460
He is making me do
all these things.

924
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:56,920
The blood on your backside
hasn't faded yet...

925
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:59,370
And you're waging a war
with the king of this town?

926
01:25:00,290 --> 01:25:03,290
I burnt the car that killed my mother!

927
01:25:03,790 --> 01:25:06,500
An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.

928
01:25:07,290 --> 01:25:09,040
I will settle that score.

929
01:27:42,710 --> 01:27:44,290
Some stranger came and hit you.

930
01:27:45,330 --> 01:27:47,170
You didn't understand
what happened.

931
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,170
You're not sure if you can
identify those who hit you.

932
01:27:54,540 --> 01:27:56,250
This is how I'm going to write the FIR.

933
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,500
It's fine, right?

934
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:02,370
Find better lies and
keep them ready.

935
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:05,120
You will need them.

936
01:28:06,370 --> 01:28:09,210
Don't try to scratch me with fire.

937
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:12,170
Fire has to be
extinguished with fire.

938
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:14,330
Jesus!
- No!

939
01:28:15,670 --> 01:28:16,670
Mikhael.

940
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:23,330
'Death will come one day...
Remember, oh man!'

941
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:29,540
'Your actions in this lifetime
would follow you'

942
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:35,540
'Perform good deeds,
without being lazy'

943
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:41,750
'Death will come one day...
Remember, oh man!'

944
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:47,750
I made a mistake in your case.

945
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,920
In your case,
it was your dad who made a mistake.

946
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:38,080
I want to know who exactly bought
this blade from this batch.

947
01:29:38,120 --> 01:29:39,670
Apart from hospitals,

948
01:29:39,790 --> 01:29:42,080
and some practicing
doctors also buy this.

949
01:29:43,170 --> 01:29:45,580
I need the list of those doctors.

950
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:53,460
The doctor you're looking for.
I know him.

951
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:04,000
Michael.

952
01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:06,040
Dr. Michael.

953
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:08,120
He's the one who
killed Georgettan.

954
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:12,540
I've reported it to the Crime Branch
DYSP who handles the case now.

955
01:30:12,960 --> 01:30:15,960
Don't you shit what you eat?

956
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:20,500
You need to be loyal to the
place which feeds you, you dog!

957
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:22,560
Just tell me what should
be done with him.

958
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,290
It's not Mikhael who should
be performing the last rites.

959
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
It's Asriel.

960
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:35,120
George Peter, who used to threaten you,
has been murdered.

961
01:30:37,330 --> 01:30:41,920
The murder weapon was a kind of surgical
blade commonly used by doctors.

962
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,460
Are you saying that
Michael did this?

963
01:31:02,120 --> 01:31:04,290
Doesn't Michael stay with you now?
- Yes.

964
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:07,040
Michael's father, John...

965
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:09,670
He was a martial arts trainer, right?
- Yes.

966
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:11,790
What do you mean?

967
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,460
Has Michael learned martial arts?

968
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:15,290
Yes.
During his childhood.

969
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:38,250
I need to talk to Michael.

970
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:07,080
Your dear sister Jenny
is calling you.

971
01:32:07,210 --> 01:32:08,210
I'll attend the call.

972
01:32:15,420 --> 01:32:16,420
I'll attend it myself.

973
01:32:18,580 --> 01:32:20,210
Jenny..
- Where are you now?

974
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:21,920
Police has come home.

975
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:26,790
Mike, why did you do this?

976
01:32:26,830 --> 01:32:29,330
Even Christ has used
a cane, right?

977
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:49,790
Mike!

978
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,170
What are you doing?

979
01:32:51,830 --> 01:32:52,830
Don't worry.

980
01:32:58,290 --> 01:32:59,580
I know what I'm doing.

981
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:05,750
Are you busy?

982
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:08,080
Yes, dear.
I am!

983
01:33:19,170 --> 01:33:21,750
Your brother will be back.
Bye, dear.

984
01:34:25,750 --> 01:34:26,750
Good morning sir.

985
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:30,370
Have you come to take
me into custody?

986
01:34:32,120 --> 01:34:33,960
I am on the side of
justice now, sir.

987
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:37,170
I realized that justice and law are
two different things, only now.

988
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:40,920
Sir, it was ours and Michael's
necessity to eliminate George.

989
01:34:41,330 --> 01:34:45,040
But Michael did not have any
personal grudge against Patrick.

990
01:34:45,500 --> 01:34:47,290
Why did he kill Patrick then?

991
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:54,920
I told him that he has to eliminate
Patrick as well, to live peacefully.

992
01:34:55,710 --> 01:34:56,960
Because...

993
01:34:58,460 --> 01:34:59,540
he's a double-gamer.

994
01:35:00,830 --> 01:35:04,580
He was the 'Shakuni' who used to
be the advisor for both gangs.

995
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:07,170
But I went wrong there.

996
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:08,540
Sugar?
- Yes.

997
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:13,960
Like cancer cells that keep growing
even if they are destroyed...

998
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,080
this will keep continuing.

999
01:35:17,250 --> 01:35:20,960
Only a specialist doctor can burn
the cancer cells in a better way.

1000
01:35:21,290 --> 01:35:22,290
And...

1001
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:24,120
He is!

1002
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:47,000
Find the person responsible for
George Peter's death, and kill him.

1003
01:35:47,330 --> 01:35:48,330
That's my goal.

1004
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:50,830
I was given this job by Patrick.

1005
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:53,000
There's no one to pay me now.

1006
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:55,670
You killed him.

1007
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:59,960
Since I'm loyal to the food I've eaten,
I'm doing my job now.

1008
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:02,460
Your sister...

1009
01:36:03,540 --> 01:36:05,670
I'm going to finish off
that cute girl, Jennifer.

1010
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:09,210
Don't worry. I'll kill her quickly,
without causing any pain.

1011
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,540
Only then it would hurt you.

1012
01:36:12,620 --> 01:36:15,170
That pain is my wage now.

1013
01:36:17,790 --> 01:36:18,790
Do you want to know...

1014
01:36:19,540 --> 01:36:21,790
how to kill someone quickly
without causing pain?

1015
01:36:37,370 --> 01:36:38,540
The blade...

1016
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:41,420
has been stabbed into a
major artery of yours.

1017
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:43,920
Within 3 minutes...

1018
01:36:45,170 --> 01:36:46,830
because of internal bleeding,

1019
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:48,790
your heartbeat would stop.

1020
01:36:50,290 --> 01:36:51,750
Your eyes would remain open.

1021
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,420
Until the blood stops
flowing to your veins,

1022
01:36:55,620 --> 01:36:56,870
you can sense everything.

1023
01:37:00,210 --> 01:37:01,750
And slowly you will die.

1024
01:37:11,620 --> 01:37:13,370
Killing without pain...

1025
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:15,920
This is how it's done!

1026
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:20,290
Well, what are you up to?

1027
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:21,920
Since when did you start this OP?

1028
01:37:22,540 --> 01:37:24,710
Scoundrel!
You'll know my true colours.

1029
01:37:24,920 --> 01:37:26,750
You've been testing
my patience for long.

1030
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:29,540
Sir, this was a case that
needed special attention.

1031
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:32,540
I said a lot with my mouth.
Now don't make me use my hands.

1032
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,250
You won't be able to bear it.

1033
01:37:34,750 --> 01:37:36,370
This is the last warning for you.

1034
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:40,330
Sir, what would the
findings be like?

1035
01:37:40,370 --> 01:37:42,710
An underworld that kills each
other in a gang war, right?

1036
01:37:42,790 --> 01:37:44,000
We should make it like that.

1037
01:37:44,120 --> 01:37:48,460
As far as I've heard, Marco is much more
dangerous than his elder brother George Peter.

1038
01:37:50,540 --> 01:37:52,580
If he had decided to kill him,

1039
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:55,670
Marco would have done it by now.

1040
01:37:56,370 --> 01:37:59,870
Wounding him, poking on it and
hurting him even further.

1041
01:38:00,210 --> 01:38:01,210
That's his goal.

1042
01:38:06,460 --> 01:38:08,140
What is it, sir?
- He looks too mysterious.

1043
01:38:08,170 --> 01:38:09,790
Take him to casualty quickly.
- Okay sir.

1044
01:38:14,330 --> 01:38:15,750
Sir, I have one more doubt.

1045
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:17,420
Your doubts aren't over yet?

1046
01:38:19,790 --> 01:38:21,670
For you to help him so much,

1047
01:38:22,170 --> 01:38:23,710
who is this Dr. Michael?

1048
01:38:24,710 --> 01:38:26,620
What's his connection with you?

1049
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:37,750
How far have you progressed
in that investigation?

1050
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:40,870
While Dr. Michael was studying
at the Medical College,

1051
01:38:41,210 --> 01:38:43,010
you were the Medical
College Circle Inspector.

1052
01:38:44,540 --> 01:38:45,710
I don't know anything more.

1053
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:47,500
Yes.
I know him.

1054
01:38:48,620 --> 01:38:51,670
I got the report from the
local police and started out,

1055
01:38:51,920 --> 01:38:53,580
without any
pre-conceived notions.

1056
01:38:55,120 --> 01:38:56,580
In front of everyone,

1057
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:59,000
especially in front of his sister,

1058
01:38:59,830 --> 01:39:01,330
Michael was a naive guy.

1059
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:03,080
But...

1060
01:39:08,500 --> 01:39:09,620
Is this Mike?

1061
01:39:11,210 --> 01:39:12,460
What I saw there...

1062
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:17,620
was the smart medical student
Michael, whom I knew.

1063
01:39:45,750 --> 01:39:47,210
Necrophiliac.

1064
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:48,920
In pure Malayalam,

1065
01:39:49,250 --> 01:39:50,790
one who has sex with a corpse.

1066
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,830
No.
You also don't say that, sir.

1067
01:39:55,460 --> 01:39:56,460
He is my younger brother.

1068
01:39:57,120 --> 01:39:58,580
My brother, whom I raised.

1069
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:03,460
He had a tiff with a seniors' gang,
two days back.

1070
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:05,620
All the students are
against him now.

1071
01:40:06,120 --> 01:40:09,250
If police stays in campus for long,
it would be a big problem.

1072
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:12,500
Sir, his food was spiked with drugs,

1073
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:15,080
and they put him there,
when he was unconscious.

1074
01:40:15,420 --> 01:40:16,790
He will give a complaint tomorrow.

1075
01:40:17,370 --> 01:40:19,170
You should hand it over
to the police, sir.

1076
01:40:19,750 --> 01:40:21,290
Rest, I will take care.

1077
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:44,920
Move, man!

1078
01:40:45,170 --> 01:40:46,170
Move!

1079
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,830
I'll bring the bike back, soon.

1080
01:41:13,370 --> 01:41:14,710
Didn't you hear me?

1081
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:16,460
Didn't you understand?

1082
01:41:17,080 --> 01:41:18,870
He can't give us the bike.

1083
01:41:19,420 --> 01:41:21,370
Hey psycho!
I need this bike.

1084
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:22,580
Sorry.

1085
01:41:22,670 --> 01:41:23,670
Patricide!

1086
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:25,500
Give me the key!

1087
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:31,330
If you call me that again,
I'll break your leg.

1088
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:34,920
Should I call one who murdered his own
father an angel, instead of patricide?

1089
01:41:35,370 --> 01:41:36,370
Patricide!

1090
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,500
I heard that you will break our
legs if we ask for your bike?

1091
01:42:15,750 --> 01:42:16,790
Light it.

1092
01:42:25,710 --> 01:42:26,710
Light it.

1093
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:30,870
Didn't I ask you to light it?

1094
01:43:22,790 --> 01:43:24,806
You don't need to study
here, wearing a coat from now on.

1095
01:43:24,830 --> 01:43:27,670
If someone asks you,
tell them that you lent it to seniors.

1096
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:41,540
If you give a complaint,
I will charge a case.

1097
01:43:42,330 --> 01:43:45,370
But they will fight the
case and make us lose.

1098
01:43:46,540 --> 01:43:49,250
There are restrictions for the
police to enter the campus.

1099
01:43:50,870 --> 01:43:52,170
Can you hit them back?

1100
01:43:53,120 --> 01:43:56,250
There's a rule for the
market and the campus.

1101
01:43:57,330 --> 01:43:59,040
Whoever wins in a fight...

1102
01:43:59,870 --> 01:44:01,120
He will be the hero.

1103
01:44:01,620 --> 01:44:02,620
He will rule that place.

1104
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:04,830
You should beat them
up inside the campus.

1105
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:09,540
I can do everything that's
necessary for that.

1106
01:44:10,250 --> 01:44:13,750
My dad has taught me everything
that's necessary for that.

1107
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:30,170
Where fear ends, life begins.

1108
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:57,620
What is it?

1109
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:24,000
If I lend something,

1110
01:48:24,370 --> 01:48:25,920
I have a habit of getting it back.

1111
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:42,620
Such guys should be killed.

1112
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:44,120
Well, sir...

1113
01:48:44,170 --> 01:48:46,620
Didn't you charge a case upon
Ameer's complaint after that?

1114
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:50,330
No, man.

1115
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,580
He didn't wait to give a complaint...

1116
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:57,790
Not being able to bear
the humiliation...

1117
01:48:58,460 --> 01:48:59,460
He was gone!

1118
01:49:01,170 --> 01:49:02,170
He was a doctor, right?

1119
01:49:03,290 --> 01:49:04,620
He took some medicine,

1120
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:06,500
and killed himself.

1121
01:49:08,870 --> 01:49:09,920
Sorry, sir.

1122
01:49:29,620 --> 01:49:33,290
Do you think you can leave from here,
after doing something to me?

1123
01:49:33,670 --> 01:49:36,000
If I can come in here
while you were sleeping,

1124
01:49:36,670 --> 01:49:38,580
Francy knows how to leave
from here as well.

1125
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:42,170
You are after all only a Junior!

1126
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:46,790
You swore at my dad so nicely!

1127
01:49:47,580 --> 01:49:48,580
Abraham.

1128
01:49:48,920 --> 01:49:50,040
That was a mistake.

1129
01:49:50,420 --> 01:49:52,460
After killing my brother,

1130
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:54,580
you're saying that
it was a mistake?

1131
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,960
Yeah. I'm gonna make
the same mistake too.

1132
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:05,710
No! Please!

1133
01:51:16,120 --> 01:51:18,460
The one who killed Abraham
is roaming around freely.

1134
01:51:19,540 --> 01:51:20,670
Aren't you ashamed?

1135
01:51:21,080 --> 01:51:22,460
Isn't it better to die?

1136
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:25,170
They are even taking
over our business.

1137
01:51:26,620 --> 01:51:28,209
It's all good for you in here, right?

1138
01:51:28,210 --> 01:51:30,530
Sleeping at eating 4 times a day,
with police protection...

1139
01:51:30,830 --> 01:51:32,290
They killed Patrick as well.

1140
01:51:32,370 --> 01:51:33,370
It's not Marco.

1141
01:51:33,830 --> 01:51:35,170
Whoever it is,

1142
01:51:35,830 --> 01:51:37,080
shouldn't we finish them, Papa?

1143
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:38,790
Papa!

1144
01:51:39,330 --> 01:51:40,460
Shouldn't we finish them?

1145
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,040
Yes.

1146
01:51:43,120 --> 01:51:44,250
We have to!

1147
01:52:04,920 --> 01:52:05,920
Where is Michael?

1148
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,000
I don't know.

1149
01:52:16,580 --> 01:52:18,420
Marco Junior.

1150
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:20,790
Heart, Lungs...

1151
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:24,540
Kidneys, Liver, Pancreas....

1152
01:52:26,210 --> 01:52:27,210
Okay.

1153
01:52:27,710 --> 01:52:29,040
Aren't you doing the blood test?

1154
01:52:31,830 --> 01:52:32,830
See!

1155
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:35,120
I'm not so cruel.

1156
01:52:39,330 --> 01:52:41,370
What are you saying?
What do you want?

1157
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:43,040
Don't get angry.

1158
01:52:44,420 --> 01:52:47,040
I didn't ask you to
sleep with me, did I?

1159
01:52:49,290 --> 01:52:50,960
Where is Michael?

1160
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:53,330
I want to meet him.

1161
01:52:53,580 --> 01:52:55,580
He said he's going to stay
away for the time being.

1162
01:52:55,670 --> 01:52:56,710
I don't know where he is.

1163
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:34,330
I'll inform the police.

1164
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:38,710
For me...

1165
01:53:40,830 --> 01:53:42,370
Police is like this!

1166
01:54:57,460 --> 01:54:59,250
Everyone has gone crazy!

1167
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,960
There's no point asking for
security from the local police.

1168
01:55:03,210 --> 01:55:04,870
You go away somewhere
for the time being.

1169
01:55:05,370 --> 01:55:06,540
I'm not scared of anyone.

1170
01:55:07,710 --> 01:55:09,790
This is not the time to show heroism.

1171
01:55:11,120 --> 01:55:13,960
Try to move to some other place with
your sister, for the time being.

1172
01:55:45,620 --> 01:55:47,040
Hello!
- What are they doing?

1173
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:50,580
They are here.
They are fine.

1174
01:55:51,210 --> 01:55:53,170
Where are you now?
- I'm on my way there.

1175
01:55:57,210 --> 01:55:58,620
Whoever it is, don't
open the door.

1176
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:01,710
It's our servant.

1177
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:03,250
Whoever it is,
don't open the door.

1178
01:56:06,330 --> 01:56:07,330
Crap!

1179
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:12,460
Can't reach her!

1180
01:57:12,710 --> 01:57:14,670
The police will stop the
vehicle within 2 kms.

1181
01:57:14,790 --> 01:57:16,290
I've informed the control room.

1182
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:32,420
There's a child inside, you dog!

1183
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:33,960
If something happens to her...

1184
01:58:34,040 --> 01:58:35,290
This is my circle, sir.

1185
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:37,420
If they shoot at the police,
we'll shoot them back.

1186
01:59:02,620 --> 01:59:05,080
Sir, within the 7 km radius of the city,

1187
01:59:05,330 --> 01:59:07,670
we don't have coverage
only for these 500 metres.

1188
01:59:07,710 --> 01:59:09,670
While we check with
the speed of the van,

1189
01:59:09,790 --> 01:59:11,210
within those 500 metres,

1190
01:59:11,460 --> 01:59:13,870
they would have transferred the
child to some other vehicle.

1191
01:59:14,460 --> 01:59:16,580
Track all the calls that Michael receives.
- Sir.

1192
01:59:22,210 --> 01:59:23,789
Someone brought this to the hospital.

1193
01:59:23,790 --> 01:59:26,080
A number is saved on this.
He asked to call that number.

1194
01:59:30,420 --> 01:59:31,420
Dr. Michael?

1195
01:59:54,620 --> 01:59:57,290
You're the one who started a
firestorm, when there was no problem.

1196
01:59:58,330 --> 01:59:59,330
You came in my way!

1197
02:00:01,120 --> 02:00:02,870
If you want your sister,

1198
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:06,370
I should see Marco's lifeless body.

1199
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:12,580
If you're not able to kill Marco,

1200
02:00:13,330 --> 02:00:15,250
don't think that you can
see the girl again.

1201
02:00:17,870 --> 02:00:21,330
And the policemen should stay away
from this game and playground.

1202
02:00:21,370 --> 02:00:23,500
That's good for both you and us.

1203
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:52,540
Mike!

1204
02:01:53,210 --> 02:01:54,210
I felt this was better.

1205
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:57,040
Stop!

1206
02:03:12,370 --> 02:03:13,370
Stop!

1207
02:03:21,330 --> 02:03:22,330
Stop!

1208
02:03:49,960 --> 02:03:51,210
There's one more in the boot.

1209
02:03:57,670 --> 02:03:59,750
Hello!
- How is she now?

1210
02:03:59,790 --> 02:04:01,710
She is okay.
Don't worry.

1211
02:05:13,210 --> 02:05:15,170
I've brought the vehicle
and medicines for you.

1212
02:06:28,250 --> 02:06:31,330
You haven't grown enough to
prescribe medicines for a doctor.

1213
02:06:40,370 --> 02:06:42,750
The dose is quite high for this one.

1214
02:06:51,750 --> 02:06:54,630
Why should I speak softly? Give some
glucose at least. - Did someone die?

1215
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,670
What is it, bro?
You don't worry.

1216
02:06:56,920 --> 02:06:58,670
- Doctor, this is not right.

1217
02:06:59,370 --> 02:07:00,540
They were strangers.

1218
02:07:00,580 --> 02:07:03,290
He always has a cold.
- There were 5-6 people.

1219
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:05,750
If it was just one or two people...

1220
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:08,790
I would've tried a hand at it.
- Did they say anything?

1221
02:07:09,210 --> 02:07:10,210
No.

1222
02:07:11,420 --> 02:07:12,960
They hit me without saying anything.

1223
02:07:13,670 --> 02:07:15,790
But I did curse them quite a lot.

1224
02:07:26,290 --> 02:07:27,830
Your guy here?

1225
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:29,000
Dr. Michael!

1226
02:07:29,370 --> 02:07:30,370
He did this.

1227
02:07:30,500 --> 02:07:31,500
Him?

1228
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:34,170
Then why didn't you report his name?

1229
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:35,750
He's a tough nut.

1230
02:07:36,540 --> 02:07:40,250
He bumped off George,
Patrick and Murugan.

1231
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:42,580
If I report this,
he will kill me too.

1232
02:07:43,620 --> 02:07:45,620
You better be aware of his true self.

1233
02:07:46,250 --> 02:07:48,620
Tomorrow, you shouldn't
end up in trouble.

1234
02:08:16,920 --> 02:08:17,920
Did you recognize me?

1235
02:08:20,000 --> 02:08:21,670
I am Gerard's uncle.

1236
02:08:27,870 --> 02:08:29,000
While you sleep,

1237
02:08:29,670 --> 02:08:31,080
it looks like a
rabbit is sleeping.

1238
02:08:32,210 --> 02:08:33,210
Lie down.

1239
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:41,750
What's the matter?

1240
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:44,000
I came to examine her shit.

1241
02:08:44,710 --> 02:08:45,710
Where is it, doctor?

1242
02:08:50,290 --> 02:08:53,920
We are all living because
of the shit in our tummies.

1243
02:08:55,250 --> 02:08:56,710
One day if we get loose motion,

1244
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:58,500
we will be done for!

1245
02:08:59,290 --> 02:09:00,290
Right, doctor?

1246
02:09:02,580 --> 02:09:03,580
Antony...

1247
02:09:04,370 --> 02:09:05,870
Shouldn't you stay
with the child?

1248
02:09:09,210 --> 02:09:10,870
Vultures are flying in circles over her.

1249
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
You go to sleep, dear.

1250
02:09:48,460 --> 02:09:49,460
Michael.

1251
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:52,250
Michael John.

1252
02:09:53,210 --> 02:09:55,920
There's a punch only when I call
your dad's name along with yours.

1253
02:09:58,120 --> 02:09:59,120
Sorry.

1254
02:10:00,040 --> 02:10:01,040
To call along with yours,

1255
02:10:01,330 --> 02:10:03,000
I don't know your dad's name.

1256
02:10:12,620 --> 02:10:13,670
Mr. Marco...

1257
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,460
I'm taking you into custody.

1258
02:10:16,210 --> 02:10:17,210
We have a statement...

1259
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:19,370
that you killed Abraham.

1260
02:10:19,790 --> 02:10:21,500
So, that's all I need.

1261
02:10:38,870 --> 02:10:42,420
I haven't reported the fact that
I've taken you into custody.

1262
02:10:43,670 --> 02:10:46,500
This one night, you can
fight against each other,

1263
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:47,920
or even kill each other.

1264
02:10:49,580 --> 02:10:52,040
And William, as per records...

1265
02:10:52,670 --> 02:10:53,670
you are not normal.

1266
02:10:53,710 --> 02:10:55,040
Whatever happens....

1267
02:10:55,420 --> 02:10:57,040
you'll be safe!
- You b@#$@!#D

1268
02:10:58,790 --> 02:10:59,960
Don't shout.

1269
02:11:00,790 --> 02:11:02,420
Don't waste your
energy unnecessarily.

1270
02:11:02,580 --> 02:11:05,420
I'm not going to give you
anything to drink or eat tonight.

1271
02:11:06,920 --> 02:11:09,580
A night for you guys to fight
it out between yourselves.

1272
02:11:10,670 --> 02:11:16,620
Or else, just hit someone's head with
this shovel while they are sleeping.

1273
02:11:18,330 --> 02:11:21,040
Even if at least one person dies,
that's great.

1274
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,000
If I follow the penal
code for everything,

1275
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:27,040
I'd be the one who would face losses.

1276
02:11:27,750 --> 02:11:29,000
I should realize that, right?

1277
02:11:30,370 --> 02:11:31,500
Okay guys!

1278
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:33,710
Have a bad night!

1279
02:11:34,330 --> 02:11:35,330
Fight each other!

1280
02:11:35,460 --> 02:11:36,460
Kill each other!

1281
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:40,420
3 days!

1282
02:11:40,580 --> 02:11:42,960
They shouldn't realize the
difference between day & night!

1283
02:12:57,960 --> 02:12:59,540
Breathe calmly, bro!

1284
02:12:59,870 --> 02:13:01,370
Submit that report to me.
- Hey!

1285
02:13:01,460 --> 02:13:02,790
Hey, you!

1286
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:04,040
Are you romancing?

1287
02:13:04,620 --> 02:13:06,500
You look like a flirt!

1288
02:13:06,870 --> 02:13:08,870
Find a solution to my
brother-in-law's problem.

1289
02:13:09,080 --> 02:13:10,080
What is this?

1290
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:13,370
Looks like my brother in law would
breathe in all the Oxygen in Kerala.

1291
02:13:13,540 --> 02:13:15,580
You don't know me!
- Hey!

1292
02:13:15,920 --> 02:13:18,830
You son of a gun! If you don't
behave, I'll smash your face.

1293
02:13:18,870 --> 02:13:19,870
No, sir.
- Get lost.

1294
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,370
What?
What's the problem?

1295
02:13:21,920 --> 02:13:23,370
No problem, sir.
- It's nothing.

1296
02:13:23,620 --> 02:13:24,620
Cool!

1297
02:13:24,620 --> 02:13:25,620
Be cool!

1298
02:13:25,670 --> 02:13:28,460
I know that you're handling this
hospital very well, Michael.

1299
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:30,580
You're not angry at me
or anything, right?

1300
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:31,790
Why sir?

1301
02:13:31,830 --> 02:13:33,790
True. Why should you
be angry at me?

1302
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:36,830
I am slightly busy.
That's why...

1303
02:13:45,790 --> 02:13:48,250
Very bad boys!

1304
02:13:48,540 --> 02:13:50,580
I thought you would fight
with each other and die.

1305
02:13:51,580 --> 02:13:52,580
Okay.

1306
02:13:53,250 --> 02:13:54,920
Let the court decide.

1307
02:13:57,330 --> 02:13:59,500
Court would be a wrong
decision, Eesa.

1308
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:03,500
It's not some non-bailable case, right?

1309
02:14:07,460 --> 02:14:08,460
I need to sleep.

1310
02:14:09,710 --> 02:14:10,710
Once I wake up,

1311
02:14:11,620 --> 02:14:13,120
I need to do certain things.

1312
02:14:20,750 --> 02:14:22,290
Marco was granted bail.

1313
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:24,870
Let everything happen
as per the law.

1314
02:14:59,670 --> 02:15:03,000
Do you think what
we did was foolish?

1315
02:15:03,710 --> 02:15:05,080
No sir.
- Why?

1316
02:15:05,290 --> 02:15:07,790
Law and justice are not the
same most of the times, sir.

1317
02:15:08,210 --> 02:15:09,919
In a small investigation I did,

1318
02:15:09,920 --> 02:15:13,370
no one among the gang who ragged
your brother Ameer is alive today.

1319
02:15:13,620 --> 02:15:17,250
All four of them died in a car
accident that happened in Tamil Nadu.

1320
02:15:19,420 --> 02:15:21,170
You are a good investigator.

1321
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:02,120
It's the 'Sacred Arrow'
festival 7 days from now.

1322
02:16:02,790 --> 02:16:06,080
I had made an offering that Jerry would
carry the Sacred Arrow for this festival.

1323
02:16:06,420 --> 02:16:07,830
Now you should carry it.

1324
02:16:08,750 --> 02:16:11,370
Even otherwise, only you are
left in this family to carry it.

1325
02:16:13,370 --> 02:16:16,000
Before that, you
should destroy them...

1326
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:18,870
Both that girl and that Satan!

1327
02:16:44,620 --> 02:16:45,620
Mike!

1328
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,370
He's asking me to fly!

1329
02:16:50,750 --> 02:16:52,330
He's asking me to fly!

1330
02:17:27,370 --> 02:17:28,370
Jenny!

1331
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:30,120
Mike!

1332
02:17:47,710 --> 02:17:48,870
Let's fight, Doctor.

1333
02:17:49,960 --> 02:17:51,210
Your sister is the referee.

1334
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:54,420
If you defeat me here...

1335
02:17:55,670 --> 02:17:57,040
You can take your sister back.

1336
02:17:57,330 --> 02:17:58,330
If you lose...

1337
02:17:59,080 --> 02:18:00,210
She will jump from here.

1338
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:06,040
Jenny won't move...

1339
02:18:07,830 --> 02:18:09,500
Until one of us wins!

1340
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:13,120
Mike!

1341
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:16,040
Mike!

1342
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:17,830
Mike!

1343
02:19:23,870 --> 02:19:26,170
Jenny, count!
Jenny, count!

1344
02:19:26,870 --> 02:19:28,210
I said count, Jenny!

1345
02:19:29,080 --> 02:19:30,080
One.

1346
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:32,460
Two.

1347
02:19:33,790 --> 02:19:34,790
Three.

1348
02:19:35,790 --> 02:19:36,790
Four.

1349
02:19:37,710 --> 02:19:38,710
Five.

1350
02:19:39,790 --> 02:19:40,790
Six.

1351
02:19:41,460 --> 02:19:42,460
Seven.

1352
02:19:43,670 --> 02:19:44,670
Eight.

1353
02:19:51,500 --> 02:19:52,500
Nine.

1354
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:08,920
Mike!

1355
02:21:58,540 --> 02:21:59,540
One.

1356
02:22:01,210 --> 02:22:02,210
Two.

1357
02:22:04,670 --> 02:22:05,670
Three.

1358
02:23:23,830 --> 02:23:25,540
I sliced your nerves.

1359
02:23:26,040 --> 02:23:27,420
Don't get too excited.

1360
02:23:28,290 --> 02:23:29,920
You are losing blood.

1361
02:23:30,790 --> 02:23:32,500
If you get medical
attention immediately,

1362
02:23:32,750 --> 02:23:33,750
you will live.

1363
02:23:49,330 --> 02:23:50,330
Help me!

1364
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:53,420
Help me!

1365
02:23:53,870 --> 02:23:55,210
I will not hurt you.

1366
02:24:01,330 --> 02:24:03,000
Why are you helping him?

1367
02:24:04,370 --> 02:24:06,750
If he survives, won't
he torture us again?

1368
02:24:10,540 --> 02:24:11,870
I am a doctor, right?

1369
02:24:13,210 --> 02:24:15,500
Even if it's one life,
I have to save it.

1370
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:43,620
Since you brought him at the right
time, it would help 3 people.

1371
02:24:43,710 --> 02:24:45,330
It was a brain death.

1372
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:44,420
To absolve the sinner
through penance,

1373
02:25:44,870 --> 02:25:46,330
I am not God.

1374
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:52,920
Aren't you doing the blood test?

1375
02:25:54,790 --> 02:25:57,750
The price to be paid
for the sin is death.

1376
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:00,460
I am....

1377
02:26:01,080 --> 02:26:02,330
Mikhael.
