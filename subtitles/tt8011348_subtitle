'Spending time at grandma's during vacation
isn't a condition but a tradition!'

2
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,400
'And so three guys set out on a vacation'

3
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,480
'On their way they see a
new route, a left turn'

4
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,400
'Well, they decide to
take that turn and...'

5
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,360
'they find themselves in a forest
like Amazon with huge trees...'

6
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,760
'and unexplored places around'

7
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,000
'They come with a plan to
pitch a tent over there'

8
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,240
'Suddenly...'

9
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,240
'They got curious wondering
from where the sound came'

10
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,000
'They walked towards that direction'

11
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,800
'To their surprise...'

12
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
'...the found an extraordinary
video game'

13
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,000
'environment like set up
in middle of the forest'

14
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,360
'What's the deal with this
environment in this forest?'

15
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,240
'They took the new route to explore and
this sound made it more interesting'

16
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,960
'They made their way
into that building'

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,040
'And...'

18
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,200
'Over there, they
saw three doctors'

19
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,720
'The doctors were doing
some research on a monkey'

20
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,440
'Towards the end of their
research, the monkey passed away'

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,920
'As the doctors left the lab, they were
heard discussing about their next research'

22
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,520
'And they were planning to do
it using that monkey's kid'

23
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,760
'The guys were shocked to hear this'

24
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,480
'Behind them, they saw baby
monkey was standing helpless'

25
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:18,200
'As the poor baby monkey
gave an innocent look...'

'our hero rescues the baby
monkey and escapes from there'

27
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,360
'When left in the forest, instead
of jumping from tree to tree...'

28
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,760
'the poor baby monkey, saddened
by its mother's death'

29
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,240
'considered our
hero as it's mother'

30
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,200

him "Dude, baby monkey..."'

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
"...will invite trouble,
better leave it here!"

33
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,800
"No matter what, I'll
take care of it" said'

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,520
'the hero and so he took
it along to his home'

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,880
'And so the baby monkey
found a new life'

36
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,400
'Watching LCD TV sitting in
an air conditioned room...'

37

the time of its life'

38
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,560
'The monkey got used to the
lifestyle of human beings'

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,520
'The most important of all...'

40
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,600
'You all must watch it drive a car!'

41
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,040
'All that is remaining is to get the monkey
driver's license and a citizenship card!'

42
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,720
'So, one fine day with this pet monkey...'

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,880
'the guys set out on one hell
of an incredible mission!'

44
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,280
"Watch out, we are coming for you"

45
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,600
Mr.Shell-face, get lost!

46
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,040
Stop giving me that look
or I'll lay one punch!

47
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,240
That was a punch
in the wrong part!

48
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,480
I predicted that this doofus is capable
of such things. Which is why...

49
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,680
Don't tell me about this doofus

50
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,320
- That's mine
- That's ok

51
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,680
- The size is different
- That's ok. Our sizes match

52
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,680
"Watch out, we are coming for you"

53
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,520
"You, won't even know who we are
why hit you"

54
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,680
Kong! Behave yourself until
the mission is complete

55
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,600
Please be quiet.
He keeps nagging around

56
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I've warned you from
pressing red buttons

57
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,320
Keep quiet! Go, sit on the
back seat you doofus!

58
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,120
Dare you speak ill of him!

59
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,760
Police! Police!

60
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,160
- Police?
- Uh-oh!

61
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,880
It's indeed the police!

62
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,400
Dude, guess they are coming to nab us.
We are done for!

63
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Kong, come here!

64
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,080
- Come here
- Sit quietly

65
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,240
Hide him under the seat

66
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,720
Fold your 'X' shaped legs!

67
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,640
- Hide under the seat! Go!
- Silence! Silence!

68
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,480
Ok

69
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,760
Game over! If they find out our
guns and masks, we'll be doomed!

70
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,440
Forget the gun.

71
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,960
- What will they think about me?
- They'll think you are a retard

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,360
The thing that keeps
us going in life is hope,

73
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,160
It can be felt but never seen

74
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,240
And the fear that threatens
to break our hopes...

75
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,520
is what we must get rid of

76
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Or else...

77
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,200
we must divert that fear

78
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,320
I didn't understand a zilch

79
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,000
Watch me now!

80
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,360
Sadhik, drive slow

81
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,400
Guess he rang your bell

82
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,200
Look at the sky and
it'll ease the pain

83
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,920
Sir, looks like your
bike's got a flat tyre

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,640
Or I think there is low air
pressure in tyre. Please check it

85
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,800
- Is it?
- Now, go! Go! Go!

86
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,040
Sir, halt aside.
Let's check

87
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,320
Doesn't look like a flat tyre

88
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,880
How do you keep it so simple?

89
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,040
You don't have to teach him that.
He is an expert!

90
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,640
Why do you sound like Ms. Doubtfire?
Where exactly did the monkey hit you?

91
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
Thank you darling.
Sit down

92
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Look here, eat on time and stay indoors.
Don't mess up the home

93
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,560
Most important, do not mingle
with those doofus guys! Ok?

94
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,840
Give me five

95
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,960
Eww! Kisses me with
a stinky mouth

96
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,280
Tickets! Tickets!
Please buy the tickets!

97
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:38,320
Buy it now or you'll get caught when
the checking inspector comes in

98
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,080
Mr. Green shirt, pass that on

99
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,880
- Where to?
- Two tickets to Alwarpet

100
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,400
- Do I have to keep shouting?
- Two tickets to Lucas please

101
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,800
- Lucas?
- Yes. Two

102
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,760
Passengers in the front pass the money

103
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,720
- To tickets to Lucas please
- Pass it. Pass it

104
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,320
Excuse me

105
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,560
Sir, I didn't get my ticket

106
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,520
I didn't get my ticket

107
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,760
It's coming.
Hold on

108
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,480
Please buy your tickets

109
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
Quick!

110
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
- Give me change
- I didn't get change

111
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,440
Is it?

112
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,960
Get it when you unboard

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,720
(Passenger)

114
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,640
Bye...bye

115
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,120
Excuse me, I passed 500 rupees.

116
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,560
Neither did I get the ticket nor
the change. Where is he?

117
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
- Two ticket to Egmore please
- Buy your tickets!

118
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,400
Egmore?

119
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,840
- One baby hospital
- Please, give it to me

120
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,200
One ticket to baby
hospital and two to Egmore

121
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,160
7 to 9 peak hours done!

122
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,160
Next...

123
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,440
Anybody in the shop?

124
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Tell me

125
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,600
I have a headache

126
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,080
My hands and legs are paining

127
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,360
And stomach is bloated

128
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,440
Go to a doctor

129
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,880
You prescribe better
medicine than the doctor

130
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,520
I'll be back

131
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,080
- See you
- Right

132
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,440
One Gelusil, PSR,
Dolo 650 two boxes

133
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,360
And Dolo 250 cough syrup

134
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,600
Send that one

135
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,400
Excuse me?

136
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,040
Which brand?

137
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,280
Bro, I need two
packets of 'Moods'

138
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,120
Aren't you Ms. Tamilisai's son?

139
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,920
Please don't tell anyone.
Please, I beg you

140
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,440
We think of buying booze
when we are home alone

141
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,640
But you? You guys think
of getting laid?

142
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,120
Fine, that would be Rs. 500/-

143
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,040
Rs 500/- ?

144
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,480
That's for one packet. Two
would cost you Rs. 1000/-

145
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,400
Do you have the money with you or
should I collect it from your mom?

146
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,240
Bro! Please, no! No!

147
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,920
I got only Rs 500/- with me

148
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,000
Fine, take one

149
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,920
But the other one
when you need it

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,640
I won't come to
your pharmacy again

151
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,720
Hey, you'll need it. Hey!

152
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,200
At least put that cover
in this one and take

153
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,120
I have been trying to reach you. Don't
you know I gotta leave at 4 pm sharp

154
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,080
Sorry, I'm late today.
Kindly adjust

155
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,320
The collection is in the cash register.
You can tally it

156
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,000
Fine. Ok

157
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,200
I promise him extra pay to
work after 4 pm but then...

158
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,760
I wonder where he goes after 4?

159
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,960
Come

160
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,400
Have a seat

161
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,280
Tell me, what's your problem?

162
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,160
I gasping for breath after walking

163
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,680
I feel dizzy very often, doctor

164
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,520
- I also have a chest pain, doctor
- Sir! Sir!

165
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,320
I treat only headache, cold, flu,
stomach ache and such petty diseases

166
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,600
I guess you have something serious

167
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,320
- Go consult a better doctor
- I can't afford that

168
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,040
I'm unable to do any work.
My wife keeps abusing me

169
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,080
If you're unable to do any work then
obviously your wife will abuse you

170
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,080
Turn around

171
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,200
Take a deep breath

172
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,640
Deeper

173
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,840
Ok

174
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,040
What shall I prescribe him?

175
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,200
Take this tablet everyday

176
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,160
And go for a walk daily.
Everything will be fine

177
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,920
Keep it in your pocket

178
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,520
You're such a young doctor but
you are very down to earth

179
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,920
There are few fraud doctors...

180
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,840
They talk as if they
are father of medicine

181
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,040
Fine, don't abuse
them unnecessarily

182
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,640
Take the tablet on time
and do step out and walk

183
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,760
Ok?

184
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
Next!

185
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,680
We're already late for office

186
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,920
Well cabs are on strike but why
are the buses running late?

187
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,640
Our buses have never been punctual

188
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,800
Show me the time

189
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,800
Hey, there's the bus

190
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,560
- Will it go to Thiruvanmiyur?
- Yes, get in

191
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
Ticket! Ticket!

192
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,840
Please buy your tickets

193
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,280
Please pass change

194
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,480
- Aiy-aiyo
- What is it?

195
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,760
Did someone dash you?

196
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,360
Nope. I don't have change.
All I have is Rs 2000/- currency

197
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,080
Do you have change?

198
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,560
Even I don't have change

199
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,360
They'll ask us to unboard
if we don't have change

200
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,360
What do we do now? Give that.
Let's try with it

201
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,840
Two tickets to Thiruvanmiyur

202
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,360
Two tickets to Thiruvanmiyur

203
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,840
Look away or else the
conductor will yell at us

204
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,120
Why hasn't our ticket arrived yet?

205
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
Patience. It'll come

206
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,200
Hey you! My money!
Return my 2000 rupees!

207
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,680
- Catch him!
- Catch him! Stop the bus!

208
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,040
Catch him!

209
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,640
- Stop the bus
- Driver! Stop the bus!

210
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,520
Move!

211
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,600
Catch him!
Hey you!

212
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,000
- Stop!
- Stop!

213
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,240
- Thief! Thief! Catch him!
- Catch him!

214
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,800
Look at her chase me
for a mere 2000 rupees

215
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,680
Return my money!

216
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Stop!

217
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,520
Careful!

218
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,240
Rascal! He escaped

219
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,400
Get up

220
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,120
Forget him

221
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,000
You're bleeding. Come,
let's go to hospital

222
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,600
No need. Forget it

223
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,480
We're late for office.
We'll go in the evening

224
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,000
Fine, come on

225
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,320
Sir, it's an empty paper
and 300 rupees for this?

226
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,800
Bargaining with a doctor?
Give me that

227
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,720
Take that tablet thrice a day
and step out and walk daily

228
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,120
What tablet does he mean?

229
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,200
Next!

230
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,400
Who's that? Next!

231
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,400
Hey, he looks exactly like that
rascal who stole my money. Isn't it?

232
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,760
You doubt everyone you see

233
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,040
Just keep quiet and come

234
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,400
- No, he looks exactly like him
- Please come in

235
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,520
Have a seat

236
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,800
Who's the patient?
Please sit down

237
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,960
What happened?

238
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,120
Today morning, a rascal in the bus...

239
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
Hey!

240
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,160
Well, she slipped and
fell of the bus, doctor

241
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,000
Show me your hand

242
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,600
Don't worry. A Tetanus shot
and dressing will be enough

243
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,320
Show me your hand

244
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,800
Careful

245
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,400
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine

246
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,760
Place your hand here...

247
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,600
It's ok. Place it over here.
Ah! Very nice

248
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,400
Looks like you had a good fall

249
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,760
Come in and change the dressing for
a week or else it'll become septic

250
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,920
It doesn't look like you
are applying medicine

251
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,000
Seems like you'll
rip her hand off

252
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
You could've been a doctor

253
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,440
- Show me your hip
- What?

254
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,200
I need to give you a shot. Where else?

255
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,880
That's ok. I'll
take it in my arm

256
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,960
Your hand is hurt that
is why I suggested hip

257
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,840
- Name?
- Jhansi

258
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,440
Jon...

259
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,680
C

260
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
- Age?
- 26

261
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,680
- Phone number?
- For what?

262
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,320
I follow up my patient and check if
they are following my instructions

263
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,440
Patient won't follow properly but
it's a doctor's duty to follow up

264
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,680
Hence, I follow up all my patients

265
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,960
Very nice doctor

266
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,440
- Note my number down
- Tell me

267
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,440
- 9424...
- 9424...

268
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,840
- 54...
- 54...

269
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,600
- 7366
- Are you there on WhatsApp?

270
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,840
You must change the
dressing for next four days

271
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,320
So do turn up without fail

272
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,800
Preferably you come alone

273
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,080
Doctor, your fee

274
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,320
Rs. 5/-

275
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,040
Rs. 5/-?

276
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,240
Yes

277
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,440
Good, you have exact change.
Thank you

278
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,920
So, do turn up without fail

279
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,000
Ok?

280
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
See that? Only Rs. 5/- is the fee

281
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,280
He usually grabs Rs 200 for headache

282
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,120
But he took just Rs 5 as if it is a girl

283
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:57,360
"Ask me and I'll tell the world
that you are the epitome of beauty!"

284
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,000
"Oh! My dear!"

285
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:07,040
"You shine like that crystal droplets!
You are like the moon"

286
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,680
"Oh! My dear!"

287
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,400
"My day doesn't start until
I get a glimpse of you"

288
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,040
"Baby! Hold my hands
forever, I need you"

289
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,560
"Please don't distance
yourself away from me..."

290
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,480
"...because my heart breaks
when you're far away"

291
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,880
"All I want is us to fall in
love and be together forever"

292
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,320
"You're the light, that
leads me in the dark"

293
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,640
"All we need is our eyes to
meet and create that spark"

294
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,040
"You're my world, I'm
already in your heart"

295
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,880
"Will you be mine forever?"

296
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,800
"I live in a fantasy but
you can make it real"

297
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,360
"I be the vision;
you be the feel"

298
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,680
"You're the soul to my life,
our love is the perfect deal"

299
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,200
"So, will you be mine forever?"

300
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,960
What's wrong with him? He is liking
all my pictures in Facebook

301
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,640
He even clicks like on
my grandparents' photos

302
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,560
"I'm experiencing
a whole new life"

303
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,200
"I can't thank you enough,
it's all because of you"

304
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,720
"Before you came into my life, it
neither had a reason nor any purpose"

305
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,040
"Every since I laid my eyes on
you; you are all I wanna pursue"

306
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:50,920
"From this moment onwards
my heart beats only for you"

307
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,320
"So open your heart for me and
let's make this dream come true!"

308
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,680
"You're the light, that
leads me in the dark"

309
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,080
"All we need is our eyes to
meet and create that spark"

310
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,520
"You're my world, I'm
already in your heart"

311
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,880
"Will you be mine forever?"

312
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,320
"I live in a fantasy but
you can make it real"

313
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,400
"I be the vision;
you be the feel"

314
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,840
"You're the soul to my life,
our love is the perfect deal"

315
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,280
"So, will you be mine forever?"

316
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,760
"All I want is us to fall in
love and be together forever"

317
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,000
- Don't be too late
- Ok dear

318
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,040
- Reach as soon as possible
- I'll be there, dear

319
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,680
What's up, buddy? You
appear to be in a good mood

320
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,760
Of course. That's what happens
when one falls in love

321
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,600
- It's turning my world topsy turvy
- Are you sure it's not the booze talking?

322
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
I feel like listening
to her voice forever

323
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,560
Well, it'll be good now

324
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,080
But when she finds out that you're
not a doctor but a fraud...

325
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,480
every word that comes out of
her mouth will hurt your ears

326
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,800
By the time she finds it out...

327
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,640
I'll be a in better and bigger position

328
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Hey Kong!

329
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,680
How do I introduce myself?

330
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,800
I'm a farmer

331
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,720
Hope you understood

332
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,200
Did you get the money?

333
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,560
Everyone here is a farmer like me

334
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,840
None of them have money with them

335
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,360
A farmer feeds the world...

336
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,160
but cannot feed good food to his daughter

337
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,640
Then how will he repay his loan?

338
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,240
We do not have any other
option than committing suicide

339
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,200
Committing suicide is
against our religion...

340
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,680
but Lord Allah made me a farmer

341
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,400
But when I think of her...

342
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,280
If we die...

343
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,880
our daughter will have to beg
in the streets. Instead...

344
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,520
with the pride of being a
farmer's daughter, let her...

345
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,440
Muruga...

346
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,360
Do you have money on you?

347
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,800
What do you need it for, Sadhik?

348
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,000
To purchase poison

349
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,720
What do you mean?

350
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,800
Isn't that the final
judgment of all farmers?

351
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,360
I too have made the same decision

352
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,520
Stop being foolish

353
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,120
We live in a nation where a
farmer's death is just another news

354
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,640
We must fight our own war

355
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,840
I suggest you go to Chennai. Few
of my friends are working in banks

356
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
Try and I'm sure you'll get loan

357
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,760
- Are you sure?
- I'm confident!

358
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,200
Start at once

359
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,240
Kong, the signal is about to be red.
Do not jump out and run to press it

360
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,880
Fold your hands and keep mum

361
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,680
Not my hands! Yours!

362
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,840
Uh-oh! Why is she
calling at this hour?

363
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,720
Hello

364
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,120
Hey, it's me. Jhansi

365
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,280
Tell me

366
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,360
Where are you?

367
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,760
Myself? I got an important
work and I'm on my way

368
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,600
Had your food?

369
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,240
- Arrgh! This girl...
- Why aren't you replying?

370
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,880
I ate. Where are you?

371
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,760
I'm out with my MD regarding
an important loan matter

372
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,000
Arrgh! Kong's all over me. Hello

373
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,920
Hello. Ok, see you

374
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,240
Fine ok. Carry on

375
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,800
Who is it, buddy? Jhansi?

376
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:01,600
Yes

377
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,720
This fellow! He is torturing me!

378
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,160
Venkat! Venkat! Control him

379
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,080
- Why is this Monkey calling me?
- Whom did he call a Monkey?

380
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:10,720
Sathish!

381
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,880
I'm getting married next week.
Aren't you jobless? Come down

382
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,360
How dare you call me up and
invite me for your wedding?

383
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,040
Who is that bride, who
agreed to marry you?

384
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,040
Why are you getting upset?

385
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,680
I just stated the fact
that you are jobless

386
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,880
Your wife will elope with
that burger faced Trump!

387
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,760
You will fail on your First
night after wedding!

388
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,640
You'll die at the hands of
your mother-in-law and wife

389
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:26,720
Idiot! Stop cursing

390
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,560
- You're an anti-Indian!
- Dude, I have a doubt

391
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,680
I can't clear it. Get lost!

392
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,800
I have heard of modern Indian.
What's with Antique India?

393
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,560
Shut up you potato!
I'm already pissed off!

394
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,280
Come on.
Don't get upset

395
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,720
Sunny Leone new video

396
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,120
Is she looking at me?

397
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,280
Oh yeah!

398
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,080
Whoa! She is coming towards me

399
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,680
Are you single?

400
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,840
Yes. It's been long time now

401
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
Ok, then I'm taking this chair

402
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,600
Was all that romantic
look for a chair? Damn!

403
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,440
- Hi
- Hi

404
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,520
Hope you’re doing fine

405
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,320
Please be seated

406
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,680
Dude, the manager is calling us.
Come, let's go

407
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,600
He calls me more often
than he calls his girlfriend

408
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,520
Come on

409
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,280
I'll be back in a minute

410
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,400
Sir, were you looking for me?

411
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,520
Yes Sathish. Our company
is running out of projects

412
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,960
As you know this is
a recession period

413
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,080
Yes sir

414
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,800
We are going to fire
more people this time

415
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,640
And this time it's
going to be 70

416
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,880
Awesome, sir

417
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,440
Give me two days time and I'll
have the list ready with 70 names

418
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,040
Sathish, you are one among the 70

419
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,760
- Sir!
- I'm sorry, Sathish

420
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,040
You! Where do we go if you
fire us all of sudden?

421
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,520
Sathish, mind your words!

422
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
Sorry, sir

423
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,240
I hope you know that it was with
great difficulty I found this job

424
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,760
My whole family is
dependent on me

425
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,920
Nothing is in my control

426
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,160
I just obey the orders from Super boss

427
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
I'm sorry

428
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,200
God, please ensure I don't hurt my hands,
legs, body and head when I hit the ground

429
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,680
Ensure I die at once I hit the floor

430
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,880
Instead of studying engineering I
could have done some petty business

431
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,480
Hey, what are you doing?

432
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,640
If I survive, please admit
me in Oppolo hospitals

433
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,840
Please don't save me, at all...
Oh my God!

434
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,160
Let go of me!

435
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:22,920
What happened?

436
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,040
Hey Venkat!

437
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,320
What happened?

438
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:25,960
Come here!

439
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,280
Come on. Help me

440
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,040
Who is it, hanging from here?

441
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,360
What are you doing instead
of giving me a helping hand?

442
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,280
Call Sathish too

443
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,040
Pull! Pull! Pull!

444
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,640
Let go of me and I'll land safely
on my foot! Just leave me!

445
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,080
- Call Sathish immediately!
- It's Sathish who is hanging!

446
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,000
Sathish!

447
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,480
- Bhai, help him. Catch him!
- Catch hold of him!

448
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,360
Bhai, please! Help him!

449
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:47,960
Look at him leave!

450
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,000
Sathish, why did you do this?

451
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,800
- Leave me, at least I'll land safely!
- Hold it! Don't let him fall!

452
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,000
Dude, pull him up!

453
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,920
- Catch it!
- Pull it! Pull!

454
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,920
- Pull it, buddy! Keep pulling
- Hey Kong!

455
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,600
- Pull
- Pull! Pull!

456
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,160
Kong, try harder! Pull!

457
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,720
- Pull
- Hold it!

458
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,960
- Sathish, don't let go of the cloth
- See my monkey?

459
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:08,600
Pull! Come on!
That's it!

460
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,320
Hey Kong!

461
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,360
Well done Kong!

462
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,920
Hey Kong, watch out!
Don't you fall down

463
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,920
- Are you nuts, you nut!
- Why did you guys save me?

464
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,560
Why did you cover your face and hang?
Are you feeling shy?

465
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,520
Are you nuts?

466
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,440
- What's your problem?
- Everything!

467
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,960
And suicide is the answer
to all the problems?

468
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,120
Are you going to give advice?
I prefer suicide!

469
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Damn it!

470
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,840
Let that be. Who was the one who put
the knot on my neck with the cloth?

471
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,600
Well buddy, I hurled the cloth to save you

472
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,960
Like in English movies, I expected
it to hook on to your waist

473
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,960
But a slight miss

474
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,560
Yeah that would've
made us miss him forever

475
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,800
Why did you guys save me?

476
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,960
We can't let alone. We better get him
some costly booze and get him sloshed

477
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,760
Or else he'll again do something
like this in the night

478
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,000
Come on, buy some booze

479
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,000
I got the job hence I paid for the booze

480
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,240
- Should I buy the booze even for losing my job?
- Of course

481
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,160
- Come on!
- Don't forget the side dish

482
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,040
Sadhik...

483
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,040
How are you?

484
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,520
Ask me why am I still alive?

485
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,080
I tired everywhere possible

486
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,200
I couldn't get a loan

487
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,240
All the efforts are a complete waste

488
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,840
Don't lose hope

489
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,520
- Let's try somewhere else
- Oh, come on now

490
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,880
Why do you sound like
you've given up?

491
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,440
When a bank can trust a
liquor factory business man...

492
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,920
Why can't they trust a farmer
who feeds the whole nation?

493
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Sadhik, forget it.
We'll find a way

494
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,200
Can you do me a favor?

495
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:25,040
If I die, collect the compensation from the
government and hand it over to my family

496
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,920
Come on!

497
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,560
Hey! Sadhik?

498
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,200
- Why should we die?
- Why should we live?

499
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,760
Dude, if you die then we
don't have a reason to live

500
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
Do you want more booze?

501
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,160
- Take it
- Thanks

502
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,680
Come on, suicide isn't the
solution for every problem

503
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,200
I already lost my job

504
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,320
I'm completely broke

505
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,040
The education loan that I
took is choking my wallet

506
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,360
On top of that I need money
to marry off my sister

507
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,680
I hate this life

508
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,840
Dude!

509
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,840
- Order some side dish
- Give me your slippers!

510
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,680
He is already feeling suicidal!
Stop asking him to order side dish

511
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,880
Indeed buddy. Even the fraud I do in the
buses, medical shop and in clinic...

512
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,920
makes me feel too cheap about myself

513
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,240
Guess what happened today

514
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,240
Aiy-aiyo!

515
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,920
Hey, ask me what happened

516
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,800
Will you leave us otherwise?
Just spit it out

517
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,240
Today, when I was at the clinic...

518
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,920
- Aiyo! Doctor!
- Doctor! Doctor!

519
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,360
- What is it?
- Doctor, please attend to this patient

520
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,800
Look, such serious issues cannot be treat
here. Take him to a bigger hospital

521
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,400
- What happened exactly?
- He set himself ablaze

522
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,200
What?!

523
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,600
- Please save him
- But I don't know to handle such cases

524
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,680
But why did he do this?

525
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,520
Because he couldn't
repay his loan, doctor

526
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:37,920
Aiyo! No! How can you leave us?
Please come back!

527
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,840
How will I take care and raise
our daughter all by myself

528
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,680
Look, you left your
family to struggle!

529
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,280
Told you forget about agriculture and
farming. Why didn't pay heed to my words?

530
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,080
I feel so cheap about playing
doctor and fooling people

531
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,080
Looks like today's booze is
giving us a new kind of high

532
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,080
Correct! Good at least
you changed now

533
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,680
When one can take such a risk to die,
imagine how much we must risk to live?

534
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,320
- Hence, I have made up my mind
- Stop it!

535
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,400
Now, I have made up my mind

536
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,520
You guys saved me today.
What about tomorrow?

537
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,120
I can't live.
I wanna die

538
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,560
- Look at him
- Look!

539
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,240
Why do you always think of dying?

540
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,560
Think about living

541
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,560
You lost your job, he wants to
become a star and I wanna make money

542
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,400
In a way all our problems
have the same solution

543
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,360
Money

544
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,920
I have a master plan
to make that money!

545
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,960
What's the plan, dude?

546
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,480
Why don't we indulge in robbery?

547
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,560
Awesome!

548
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,920
- Thank you
- One hell of a plan!

549
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,680
We can indulge in pottery
but no way robbery!

550
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,040
Come up with a robbery plan

551
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,480
I can come up with ideas for suicide

552
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,680
You come up with ideas for robbery

553
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,800
There is a businessman in our area

554
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,880
If we rob his house,
we can make a fortune

555
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,200
Dude, I need at least 30 million

556
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,520
What about print and publicity?

557
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,720
Then make it 50 million

558
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,080
So your problem is the number.
You're ready to rob?

559
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,600
Get lost!

560
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,720
- Dude, where is the side dish
- Police will snatch half of the money

561
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,200
And then will frame us in all
the cases that has no culprits

562
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,280
- Shut up you chicken
- Are you here to take orders?

563
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,960
Welcome bhai. It's been a
month since you're here

564
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,080
- Why don't you talk to us?
- Say why?

565
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,600
- Why don't you talk to us?
- Say why?

566
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,040
- Why don't you talk to us?
- Say why?

567
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,200
How will he talk if you guys
don't give a break! Let him talk

568
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,600
Please let me join your team

569
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,920
Like we have an IPL team and
you want to be a part of it

570
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,280
He is not even in our age group.
Reject him

571
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,120
Forget it

572
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,160
I overheard your discussion

573
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,000
I'm ready to join you
guys in the robbery

574
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,800
See that? He was eavesdropping.
I'm telling you he is danger

575
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,200
Shut up!

576
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,960
We must plan in a way that
we settle for once and good!

577
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:32,040
We must rob a bank in
order to achieve that

578
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,440
Rob a bank?

579
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,880
Whoa! That is one hell of an idea

580
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,400
Rob a bank and you
can get millions

581
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,880
We can settle down for good

582
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,800
This is why there must
be a senior in the gang

583
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,920
Pour a drink for the senior

584
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,160
Stop blabbing. Robbing a individual
house; now that sounds do-able

585
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,800
A bank will have CCTV cameras,
securities and around 20-30 staffs

586
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,200
Then we'll rob on a Sunday

587
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,400
Step out to rob with this criminal and
this doofus, trust me we'll end up in jail

588
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,000
To settle down with a huge
sum, bank sounds perfect

589
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,320
Raise your hands who are in for this one

590
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,160
I'm in

591
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,200
You also raise your hand

592
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,680
It's your idea then what's with the
slow motion? Raise your hands!

593
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,720
Superb!

594
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,160
Super plan

595
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,600
I wanted to die alone

596
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,040
But now all of you are gonna
die along with me. Go ahead

597
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,960
Come to the rough top
err..roof top tomorrow

598
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,120
We'll make a perfect plan

599
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,320
According to plan all of you
come to the rough top tomorrow

600
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,520
Fine! That was a nice performance.
Get up

601
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,840
- Hello
- Look the phone is ringing. Attend it

602
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,640
Sorry buddy, I thought
it was the door bell

603
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,680
 Hello. Would like to borrow
some coffee powder or sugar?

604
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,080
You had asked me to come

605
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,080
We usually never ask men to visit us

606
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,400
Anyway, come in

607
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,920
Please, come in and
lied down, sir

608
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:51,000
Dude, his face ain't that
bad to make you wanna puke

609
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,600
What's the matter?

610
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,600
Did you forget what you said
at the bar, last night?

611
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,200
How can I forget?
After all I was the one who ordered

612
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,400
Two double larges, one double large,
one chips packets , 2 omelet and...

613
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,160
half boil

614
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Yes, one half boil

615
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Look at my best friend, sir!

616
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,120
He named all the liquors
we had yesterday!

617
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,760
Stop talking like a fool

618
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,360
Last night at bar, didn't
we decide to rob a bank?

619
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,520
What? Rob a bank?

620
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,720
Are you still high
from last night?

621
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,160
Why are you asking us to join?

622
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,440
Get out or else I'll
order Kong to bite you

623
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,000
We all come from good families..

624
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,320
We eat only at hospitals

625
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,000
- But last night you guys where showing off..
- You! What's your problem?

626
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,480
You look soft and innocent...I won't
break but I'll rip you apart!

627
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,360
Ask him to get lost

628
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,400
Get out!

629
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,920
Sir, please leave

630
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,640
Dude, from where did he come up
with robbing idea out of the blue?

631
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,960
I guess he got the wrong mixing
last night for his booze

632
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,720
We must also keep a check on
the water we pour on the booze

633
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:43,760
Promise me!

634
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,200
- Promise
- Promise

635
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,520
Aiyo...

636
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,600
That oldie is torturing us again and again.
Watch me break his head

637
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,480
You!

638
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,800
Dude...

639
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,840
It's JonC

640
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,680
- You could have gone through with the blow
- Yeah right!

641
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,640
Do you have any idea how many
times I called you last night?

642
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,080
You didn't pick my calls
and it got me worried

643
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,720
- That he'll ditch you?
- Get lost!

644
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,160
That doofus tried to commit
suicide for losing his job

645
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,240
Why did you stop him? After
all he is a burden on earth

646
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:09,160
Excuse me! I am God's child!
Death will never find me!

647
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,040
Hey, I wanna tell you something.
Come

648
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,120
- What is it?
- Come on

649
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,960
Hey, let me at least refresh myself

650
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,040
- Why did you bring me to the terrace?
- Come, I'll tell you

651
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,760
What's the matter?

652
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,000
My parents are seriously
finding a groom for me

653
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:24,760
I'm confused

654
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,320
Please, try to postpone the
groom hunt a bit for my sake

655
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,160
I'll wait forever for you

656
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,600
But my family is putting lot of pressure

657
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
Fine, sit down

658
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,600
Ok

659
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
I shall manage as much as I could

660
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,080
If it reaches the break point
then I'll come here to you

661
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,040
You have waited so many days

662
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,760
Just a few more days

663
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,160
Ok?

664
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,040
Kong! Son of a...

665
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,240
I missed a kiss because of you!

666
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,600
After all he is your friend!
He is just like you

667
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,760
Yeah right!

668
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,520
- So?
- I'm leaving. Bye

669
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,640
- My kiss?
- Bye Kong

670
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,000
Listen, I've brushed my teeth

671
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,920
Listen to me. Kisses are
really good for the heart

672
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,320
- Hey Kong, what happened?
- Hey, where's my kiss?

673
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,000
- You want me to sit. Sit. Sit
- Jhansi!

674
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,320
What? What is it?

675
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,240
Feelings?

676
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,400
Shouldn't have made you
watch 'King Kong' movie

677
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,920
You're just an ordinary Chimpanzee.
Got it?

678
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,840
Don't try to imitate King Kong and fall in
love. She isn't the lady love of your movie

679
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:25,200
Can't you hear me? Stop feeling yourself
as someone from Hollywood...Aiyo!

680
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,480
Hits in the wrong place
every single time

681
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,760
What happened?

682
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,000
I was climbing the terrace since
there was no range. Tell me now

683
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,080
I asked you for some money for your sister's
wedding. Why can't you act responsible?

684
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,320
Behave like an
elder brother...

685
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
I'm elder, still single and she
is bothered about sister's wedding!

686
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,920
- Catch hold of him!
- Let go off me! I'm gonna suicide

687
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,000
- Dare you stop me!
- Come on! Aren't you God's child?

688
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,920
Leave me!
I'm the son of the demon!

689
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,960
Catch hold of him.
Pull him back!

690
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,240
- Catch hold of him!
- It's putting his hand inside my mouth!

691
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,520
- Why should we die?
- Why should we live?

692
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:01,520
Listen, I have decided

693
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,520
That robbery is the only option to solve
all our problems. What do you say to that?

694
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,600
Order a couple of half boil

695
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,120
Shut up, you football!

696
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,960
Look, It's our bhai brother

697
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,400
He seems to be lonely, Lets go
check on him. Hello brother!

698
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,720
Didn’t he promised to show up yesterday.
Hey, brother why are you sitting all alone

699
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,840
Why didn't you show up
yesterday as promised?

700
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,680
You planned everything, why weren't
you there for executing the same?

701
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:20,800
Why didn’t you come dude?

702
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,720
I am extremely mad
at you people!

703
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,960
You guys better leave!

704
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,720
Your funny face does tell us
that you are mad. Let’s face it

705
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,080
Why have you brought your
medications to a wine shop?

706
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,240
I have seen people take
medications after their meal

707
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,520
First time someone's take
medication after boozing!

708
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,360
It is Viagara, I guess

709
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,600
Sit down brother. Please sit

710
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,160
You planned everything for us,
but you dint turn up at the time

711
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,560
His majesty got scared, I guess

712
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,200
What's there to worry about?

713
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,720
We'll make a perfect plan and
execute it in the gorilla style

714
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,360
We'll loot the money...

715
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,320
and live happily forever. Sounds good?

716
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,560
Dude, on one condition!

717
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,320
- What's that?
- Only stealing money should be our motto

718
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,880
We should not harm women
or children at any cost

719
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,280
Don't worry.
They don't touch your shadow.

720
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,120
Of course, I'm a hero and
that's how I should talk

721
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,360
- Cheers buddy
- Cheers!

722
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,120
Cheers!

723
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,080
Of course, that's
how a hero must be!

724
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,440
Bye brother! Bye!

725
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,040
Don't forget to show up tomorrow morning

726
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,720
We'll plan and loot

727
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,480
Don't forget, brother

728
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,200
Sathish, get the door!

729
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
Look at him! He thinks
he is in a salon

730
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,400
Now, who's that disturbance
at this late hour?

731
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,520
Hello

732
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,760
Bathroom cleaning?

733
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,600
You had asked me to come

734
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,880
But you're not the one who
comes in toilet cleaner ad!

735
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:24,760
Hello!

736
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,800
Hello! Excuse me!

737
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,600
Where are the
cleaning equipments?

738
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:32,280
Brother, didn't we make it clear yesterday
morning. Why are you disturbing us repeatedly?

739
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,880
Hey Kong, move aside

740
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,120
I'm not here to waste time

741
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,640
We are going to rob
as per your plan

742
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,960
Who's this crazy fellow? Why does he
keep saying 'your' plan repeatedly?

743
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,600
Leave or else...

744
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,880
shall I call the police?

745
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,560
- Tell him
- He must have heard you. Leave!

746
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,760
We'll make a perfect plan and
execute it in the gorilla style

747
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,840
We'll loot the money...

748
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,200
I look so smart in the video

749
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,520
Shut up, you doofus!

750
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,320
Boss, we keep blabbing and
making up stuff when we are high

751
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,600
Last month we blabbed a
plan to kidnap Nayantara

752
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,000
Doesn't mean you must
take it seriously

753
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,480
Sir, we were drunk and making jokes.
You seem to have taken it seriously

754
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
Ask him to leave

755
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,720
Please leave, sir

756
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,800
- Hello, leave!
- Look!

757
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,040
- Stop it
- He's furious

758
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,440
I'm anyway gonna rob
according to your plan

759
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,120
If I get caught, I will
take you guys with me

760
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,600
Even if I don't get caught, I'll forward this
video and frame your guys for the robbery

761
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,680
Come with me and you
will get your share

762
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,640
You will get caught
even if you don't come

763
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,400
Sir!

764
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,240
Why are you so serious about this?

765
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,000
We were just blabbering
after the booze

766
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,360
Dude, I am leaving. Will meet
you guys for next holiday

767
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,560
Hey! Stay!

768
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,440
Sir, I came to the town
to spend my holidays

769
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,360
I got news that my grandmother
passed away this morning

770
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,280
Sir, I got to go

771
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,000
- My grandma will miss me, sir
- You act really well

772
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,720
Myself?

773
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,040
Look he acknowledged
my acting skills

774
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
He started blabbering again

775
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,200
I'll be back in the evening

776
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,680
Better make a good
decision by then

777
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,080
Hand me the video before
you leave, please

778
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,920
- Video please!
- Will send it through WhatsApp!

779
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,120
What do we do now?

780
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,120
Dude...

781
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,680
How come he is saying no to booze?

782
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,640
He is checking the time

783
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,840
Buddy, we are not going
to rob anything right?

784
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,440
When are we going for the loot?

785
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,520
Dude, go with him to the bank for
depositing money and still we'll be caught

786
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,720
Setting out to rob with him,
we'll be busted for sure!

787
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,120
Trust me, it’s a risky job

788
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,240
I have made up my mind

789
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,760
If we don't get what
we want in life...

790
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,800
why shouldn't we choose the
life that's presented before us?

791
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,200
Not the time for philosophies

792
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,880
It is not that easy to rob a bank

793
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,040
Who knows, we might get killed

794
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,800
Do not think about losing before playing

795
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,280
Play so that you don't lose!

796
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,680
Dude, this is not angry birds.
It's Blue whale!

797
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,720
We will definitely die

798
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,880
There is nothing to be afraid of.
If the plan is flawless...

799
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,200
- .. you do not worry about anything.
- Shall I come in?

800
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,720
Here comes the curse!

801
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,280
Here comes the agent
to the Lord of death

802
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,880
So, what have you decided?

803
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,680
Won't you drink until we give an answer?

804
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,880
So, when do we rob the bank?

805
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,080
Forget the police,
team up with him...

806
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,240
and the security
guy will nab us!

807
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:07,800
I agree

808
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,040
Let's watch all the bank robbery movies

809
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,920
We will analyze all the ideas
and will apply the same here

810
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,560
Does it seem fair to you?

811
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,400
If we start judging what's
fair and what's not

812
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,960
we can't live an honest life

813
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:29,040
There is something common in all the
movies that we watched. Guess what?

814
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,480
Indeed buddy.
All the heroines were hot!

815
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,680
They use gun to execute a robbery

816
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,520
So...

817
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,760
we need a gun, first

818
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,040
I can arrange that

819
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,480
I knew it!
You're here well prepared

820
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,240
We'll need Rs. 25,000 to buy a gun

821
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,840
If we pile up all the
money that we got...

822
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,080
we can buy only one gun

823
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,080
- Give it to me

824
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,840
- For what? So that you
can take it and escape?

825
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,280
Dude, his plan is not to
rob a bank but rob us

826
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,680
- Then come along with me
- No. I have a 'hairache'

827
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,840
- Have some Parotta
- You think Parotta will cure my 'Hairache?'

828
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,360
- Make sense while you talk
- You do that first!

829
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,320
Shut up!

830
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,840
What do we do for the remaining amount?

831
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,840
Exactly

832
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,080
Don't look at me.
I have no money with me

833
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Kong

834
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
There not even a single penny in there

835
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,880
Here

836
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,720
Card number

837
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,600
"2656"

838
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,600
How do you guys even find it out?

839
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,560
Are you behind all this?
You disloyal mongrel!

840
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,680
Acts smart and look what it's doing now!

841
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,320
Don't end up hurting yourself!

842
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,960
Hello Boss!

843
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,960
Why so late?

844
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,480
Sir, please help me

845
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,520
If I manage to cut his hair, I could
earn my weekly income in a day

846
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,720
Please sit down.
Kindly wait

847
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,680
- Let me clean the place
- Make it fast

848
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,720
Help yourselves with
the latest news...

849
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,040
while I finish my
morning prayers

850
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,640
- Make it fast
- You have big heart; just like your head!

851
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,640
Dear Lord...

852
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,680
I don't mind the growth
of crops this season

853
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,880
But please make sure the hair growth
of people does not fail at any cost

854
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,840
Sir

855
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,200
Please come

856
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,040
Sir

857
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,320
What do you prefer, a hair
cut or a clean shave?

858
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,600
I am not here for either

859
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:27,520
The liquor shop nearby opens only a noon.
I needed a place to rest until then

860
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,160
Also a place where I
can entertain myself...

861
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,120
in some air conditioned
place, reading a magazine

862
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,040
or even watching TV

863
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,440
- So, you are not here for a hair cut
- Of course

864
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,120
You're here to while away your time?

865
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,000
Yes!

866
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,280
I'll rip you apart if I
see you around my salon!

867
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,320
Get lost!

868
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,840
Mr. Landlord, how come you
are calling me this early?

869
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,120
I called to check upon your
special client Sunny Leone

870
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,560
Kidding me, are you?

871
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,720
It's been six months
since you paid any rent

872
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,360
I can't wait anymore!

873
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,840
Vacate the shop today

874
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,480
There will be a soup
shop in the same place

875
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,720
- They even paid the advance for the shop.
- Sir, please give me some more time

876
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,000
He disconnected the call

877
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,840
My dear daddy

878
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,280
Oh my dear son!

879
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,840
You seem to be in a good
mood, early in the morning

880
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,120
Don't get on my nerves dear. The
landlord called this morning

881
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,880
He said there will be a soup
shop in this place tomorrow

882
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:22,720
Is it?

883
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,640
What shall we do,
I am not a good chef!

884
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,360
You're not a good stylist either

885
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,440
The landlord has rented this place to the
soup shop guy as we have not paid the rent

886
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,120
He also asked us to vacate
the place right away

887
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,760
What a coincidence daddy

888
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,440
The landlord of our house called too

889
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,080
He asked us to vacate the place as
we have not paid the rent there too

890
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,080
- It is an insult to us!
- What shall we do now, dad?

891
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:43,200
I have a great plan to overcome
these financial hurdles

892
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,400
Come here

893
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,360
What if we rob the nearby bank?

894
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,880
Superb idea!

895
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:48,600
Awesome!

896
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,440
I love you daddy

897
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,040
Get the weapons ready my son

898
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,200
- I saw it first
- I took it first. Leave it

899
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,120
You touched with left but
I touched it with right

900
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:57,640
- Stop fighting like kids
- He won't let go of it

901
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,640
Choose anyone

902
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,600
Leave it. This is mine

903
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,840
Guns are here. What about bullets?

904
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,920
Bullets?

905
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,040
These are shooting gun

906
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,440
Of course guns are
used for shooting

907
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,840
He wants to know
where are the bullets

908
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,520
Where are the bullets?

909
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,000
- By shooting I meant cinema shooting
- Cinema shooting?

910
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,960
Who's the hero?

911
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,720
You retard!

912
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,920
One of my friend is a stunt man in Cinema.
I got it from him

913
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,040
So this is a dummy gun?

914
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,520
Is this for what we paid Rs. 25,000

915
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Told you. He is not here
to rob the bank but us

916
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,320
Whoa!

917
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,800
For the money you gave me, only
one original gun can be bought

918
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,520
So, which is the original gun?

919
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,040
The one that everyone didn't like...

920
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,160
This is the original gun

921
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,400
How will we rob with dummy guns?

922
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,920
That's why I said don't
believe this guy

923
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,840
Only we'll know that
these guns are dummy

924
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,320
The onlookers won't know

925
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,080
No way.
Hand me the small gun

926
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,280
Do you think we are the police
to shoot as per our wish

927
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,200
Robbing the bank is our only motto

928
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,600
- Fine
- Buddy...

929
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,960
Why don't we do a
rehearsal before robbing?

930
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,800
- Awesome idea
- This is too much

931
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,240
Remember that movie in which they abduct
the vehicle going to the bank and rob it?

932
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,400
Similarly, let's rob a van
that's carrying money to the ATM

933
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,920
Watch out for my performance

934
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,040
Show me a sample

935
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:02,680
Once more

936
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,800
Listen to me, we don't need him.

937
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,000
- Sathish!
- Shut up

938
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,200
We'll get caught if
we try this in city

939
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,880
Hence, we'll abduct an ATM
van on the outskirts...

940
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,680
and rob it!

941
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,840
In order to finish
this successfully...

942
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,200
what we need in the
first place is a mask

943
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,320
This is a gorilla attack

944
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,280
So...

945
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,600
This is way too out in the outskirts.

946
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,960
Lower the window
Sweated

947
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,640
I have inquired all the details

948
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,840
The van with the money will pass this
route to deposit the money in ATM

949
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,800
Kong! Any sign of any ATM vehicle?

950
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,240
Hey Kong has given us the signal

951
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,360
Wear your mask, everyone!

952
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,280
- Wear it! Wear it!
- Quick! Wear it!

953
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,920
- Did you wear it? Oh my God!
- Aiyo! Gorilla!

954
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:00,280
He has stopped it.
Come on, now! Quick!

955
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,920
Step out! Out!

956
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,400
Sir! Please! Don't shoot me

957
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:16,000
I'll take care here, buddy.
You carry on

958
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,760
- Open the door!
- Superb!

959
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,200
- Go! Open the door
- Stop day dreaming and open it

960
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,400
Make it fast! Quick!

961
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,720
Get in!

962
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,800
- Buddy! It's me
- Whoa! Rascal!

963
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,000
Guys, quick take all the money

964
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,720
- Hey!
- What is it?

965
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,000
Where's the money?

966
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,240
Sir, we are returning from
loading the ATM with money

967
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,360
- What?
- Damn it!

968
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,040
Why did you remove the mask?

969
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,560
- Why did you?
- There is no money

970
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:41,840
My nose was itching

971
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,160
No money?

972
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,360
Why are you spitting on me?

973
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,800
At least give us 50
rupees if you have

974
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,080
Are we here to beg for money?

975
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,360
It was this way. Right?

976
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,360
I wonder how will I manage
with you guys...Move!

977
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,000
Uh-oh!

978
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:56,760
- Police! Police!
- Wear the mask! Wear it!

979
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,840
We'll get caught if we speak in our own
voice. Try to mimic some celebrity

980
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,080
- Aiy-aiyo!
- I'll hurl things at you, doofus!

981
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,040
Why is he running away from us?

982
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,760
Thank God! My deity saved me

983
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,600
It was not God but gun that saved you

984
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:20,160
Didn't you notice?
What were you doing?

985
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,840
Sorry buddy

986
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,080
I expected there would be money
but the idea flopped. Forget it

987
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,000
Failure is the first step to success

988
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,440
Wait and watch, you'll be thrashed

989
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,360
Do you want some?

990
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,360
Did you guys notice?

991
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:33,120
Since we had gun,
no one dared to near us

992
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,960
- That too on a broad daylight
- There is nobody in there

993
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,680
There are two primary
issues with our people

994
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,480
One being bystanders when there is an issues
and another being ignorant towards it

995
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:43,000
That is why people murder in
broad daylight and rob any place

996
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,120
And people like us are able
to plan a bank robbery

997
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,440
- You!
- What else are we doing?

998
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,880
Even though the first planned flopped,
it has given me some courage

999
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,680
So...

1000
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,440
the best thing is to
rob the bank next

1001
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,480
We must get in, rob the bank
within 20 -30 minutes and escape

1002
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,280
What?

1003
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,640
You talk as if we are going to
withdraw money from our account

1004
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,800
How will we get into the bank?
Tell us that

1005
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,920
Then bank we select must be three to
five kilometers away from police station

1006
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,880
Why?

1007
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,680
Only then when they get the information and
by the time they reach it'll take 30 minutes

1008
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,000
Someone's is going to press the alarm for
sure, before we enter the locker room

1009
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,120
Superb! Then we'll
get caught and die!

1010
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,280
How do we hide and take
the guns inside the bank?

1011
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:19,960
You don't miss your
focus, do you?

1012
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,840
- This time I'm thinking we'll use Burqa
- Burqa?

1013
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,440
No, burqa will be in black colour
and will take in lot of heat

1014
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,120
Face will get tanned

1015
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,960
He speaks as though he's been born in
Switzerland and brought up in New Zealand

1016
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,440
- Hey I am an actor dude!
- You are mad!

1017
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,400
We need to identify which bank is far
from the reach of a police station

1018
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:34,280
I know the details

1019
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,960
Yes, he knows everything. He
has already planned everything

1020
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,120
I have come across several
while trying to apply for loan

1021
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,360
I know a little about
how banks function

1022
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,320
You were planning to rob a bank all
along and not to apply for loan

1023
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,800
There is a bank which is five km far
from Vandalur police station

1024
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,080
Bank of Hindustan

1025
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,280
Fake guns are alright! What about
the fake bombs I asked for?

1026
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,080
They have called me today.
I will go

1027
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:59,520
Kong, please stay with me!

1028
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,840
This accused ain't resting
until he gets us all killed

1029
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,440
More than this gun...

1030
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,280
It is Kong, that will
really scare everyone!

1031
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,560
So we are definitely
taking him along

1032
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,840
You too will soon be dead

1033
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,800
Brindavanam

1034
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,800
- Hey
- Sir?

1035
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,400
- Can't you hear me?
- Sorry sir, I didn't hear

1036
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,840
- Venkat will be coming
- Ok sir

1037
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,960
- There are three dummy bombs on the table
- Ok

1038
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,080
and another one will be on the right
side cupboard...

1039
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,560
- hand those over to him
- Ok, sir

1040
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,080
- Will you do it?
- Yes sir, I will

1041
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,840
It's been a long time and you guys
are not even responding properly

1042
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,120
The boss has just left

1043
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,360
Talk to him once he is back

1044
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,960
- Don't you delay further
- I'm here to meet Sait

1045
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,160
My name is Venkat, he
has asked me to come

1046
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,160
Boss has left the place. Please
wait here, I will bring it

1047
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:40,960
Okay

1048
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,920
Which one is the
right side cupboard

1049
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,280
This should be the one

1050
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,320
Take this

1051
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:59,800
What about the bill?

1052
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,800
- I will speak to your boss about that.
- Ok sir

1053
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,960
This is the bank we are gonna rob

1054
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,600
- Don't hit me, sir
- Go! Get lost!

1055
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:21,920
Dude, it's the police.
Take a U turn

1056
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:22,880
Shut up!

1057
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,640
- Why are you so scared?
- It's confirmed that we are dying today!

1058
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,120
Stop being a chicken!

1059
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,240
Let's do one thing

1060
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,160
First, let two of us get in
and analyze the situation

1061
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,040
Nice idea, dude. You both do that.
We'll wait here

1062
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,080
Correct!

1063
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,960
You and me, we'll get
inside the bank first

1064
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,520
Correct

1065
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:42,040
Then both of you come in
later along with Kong

1066
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:43,000
- Ok?
- Instead...

1067
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,800
The three of you go inside and check.
I'll take care of the car

1068
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:46,360
Shut up!

1069
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:48,440
Why the mask if we are
already wearing the Parda?

1070
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,360
Stop yapping away!

1071
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,720
What if the Parda flies off
and our face is exposed?

1072
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:52,400
Hence...

1073
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,520
Now, shut up and step out

1074
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,080
They appoint employees
from north...

1075
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,240
they don't understand me and
I don't understand them

1076
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,280
This goes on then Tamilian
will end up begging!

1077
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,000
That too you must beg in Hindi

1078
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,880
Don't cry, my baby.
What happened?

1079
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,560
Don't cry

1080
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,600
Hey!

1081
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,120
Hey!!

1082
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,600
Hey!!!

1083
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,360
Wear the parda

1084
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:41,920
Cover your face!

1085
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,880
- Excuse me, watch out!
- You shut out!

1086
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:46,760
Close the door!

1087
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,960
Don't cry, my baby

1088
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:51,000
Where are you barging in? Move!

1089
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,400
Save him Lord Allah!

1090
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,560
Here, have a Samosa

1091
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,320
Fools!

1092
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,280
Why?

1093
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,560
Of course. You eat the Samosa
first and then drink tea!

1094
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:10,400
Look at them, they are drinking the
tea and then having the Samosa!

1095
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,320
To hell with you and your....

1096
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,280
What's your problem?

1097
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,800
Eating Samosa and then drinking
tea is the right way to eat

1098
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,680
Hey! Look the police is getting
inside the bank. Call Jiiva

1099
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:19,760
Call him!

1100
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,640
(Song from Tamil movie 'Viswasam')

1101
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,880
Where is he running to?

1102
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,200
Aiy-aiyo! Police!

1103
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,960
Madam, was that 1.5 million
credited in my account?

1104
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,680
- Please wait, I'll check
- Greetings madam

1105
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,640
- It is underway
- Uh-oh! Police again!

1106
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,240
All hail the Lord
Jesus Saranamallah!

1107
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,200
Please save me!

1108
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,040
Whoa! She is as tall as actress Anushka!

1109
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,840
This is gents toilet. Ladies
toilet is right next to this

1110
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,120
If it's too urgent. Go ahead.
I'll guard this place for you

1111
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,280
Go ahead. I'll keep an eye

1112
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,480
Keep an eye on me?
I'll slap you! Get lost!

1113
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:09,600
Slap me?

1114
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Excuse me, madam.
You misunderstood me.

1115
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:14,560
I'll turn around and guard

1116
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,640
"It has to be you, I'm sure
Knocking at my heart's door"

1117
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,160
Hasn't she left yet?

1118
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,200
Aiyo!

1119
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,080
Uh-oh! Why is he approaching me?

1120
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,120
Madam, is this your pen?

1121
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,120
This is not mine!

1122
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,080
Guess she must be pissed
off with her husband

1123
00:52:56,120 --> 00:52:57,280
Allah will bless you

1124
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,840
They are coming out

1125
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,000
Go

1126
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,600
Good, we saved them somehow

1127
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,880
Your game starts inside the bank.
For now, stay inside the bag

1128
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:27,400
- Step out!
- Who are you?

1129
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,120
What the hell?
You're showing a gun!

1130
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,240
Hello!

1131
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,360
Please follow the queue

1132
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,840
Oh! Ok. Ok

1133
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,520
Mr. Blue Shirt, stand properly

1134
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,400
Hey! What are you doing?

1135
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,640
He asked me to follow the queue

1136
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,680
Will you fill the receipt to rob a bank?
Use the gun, doofus!

1137
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,240
At him! Idiot!

1138
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,200
Be clear!

1139
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,840
I wonder how am I gonna
escape from here with her!

1140
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,360
You want me to follow queue?

1141
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,960
Uh-oh! Jhan...si!

1142
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,040
Hit him! Get up, all of you!

1143
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:38,240
Move! Move!

1144
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,160
Do you think this is a dummy gun?
Move, I say!

1145
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,280
Move! Move!

1146
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,080
Why is your hand shivering?

1147
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:46,040
Look there and your
hands will also shiver

1148
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,720
Come here

1149
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,160
I said, come in

1150
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,320
Hands off me!

1151
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,840
Get inside!

1152
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,720
Open!

1153
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:58,880
Help!

1154
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,440
- Stop! Stop! Move!
- Move! Move!

1155
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,240
- This way
- Don't dash others

1156
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,560
Stand one after the other

1157
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:11,560
Move!

1158
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,400
"Watch out, we are coming for you"

1159
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:15,920
"You, won't even know who we are
why hit you"

1160
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:20,280
"Lock, cover your money inside
Run along, won't let you hide"

1161
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:21,640
Look here

1162
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,840
Whatever we rob from this bank...

1163
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,720
can be claimed by this
bank through insurance

1164
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:33,600
So, if anyone tries to save the bank
and become a hero, lives will be lost

1165
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,960
People who value their life, sit down!

1166
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,600
- Sit down!
- Get everyone's mobile

1167
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:40,600
Hey, come on

1168
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,440
- All of you, take out your phone
- You, in green Saree. Give me your phone

1169
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:45,280
What about Jhansi? She is alone inside

1170
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:49,040
Nothing to worry. We'll rob and be out
from here in ten minutes. Got it?

1171
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,400
I appreciate your dedication.
Work before love?

1172
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,000
Who is that doofus, who
didn't hand us the phone?

1173
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,080
- That's my phone!
- Jiiva, I got ten rupees

1174
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,120
- Sorry
- It's mine

1175
00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:00,480
- I snatched it from that white shirt
- Don't lift your dress like that! Ewww!

1176
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,320
Jhansi's calling me

1177
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,560
They are quiet.
You, go ahead and talk

1178
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,200
Hey! Mind you guys.
Don't you make any noise

1179
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,120
Tell me, baby

1180
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,360
Jiiva, I came to BOH bank,
at Vandalur for a work

1181
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,320
Few robbers broke into the bank

1182
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,360
- They locked me up in the toilet
- Relax. Relax, baby

1183
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,080
Don't you worry.
I'll come there in ten minutes

1184
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,400
Don't you inform the police at any cost

1185
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,520
Because it'll put your
life in jeopardy. Ok?

1186
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,560
Ok

1187
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,000
- Dude...
- Tell me

1188
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,280
Jhansi has a phone!

1189
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,920
I know. Just saw her FB post
stating "I'm in trouble"

1190
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,280
I disliked it

1191
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,960
Whom was I saying it to? Damn!

1192
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,360
Wait, I'll come back and deal you

1193
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,920
Dude, I disliked the status

1194
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,800
- Here
- Give it to me

1195
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,560
Looks like you got her phone

1196
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,360
You are better than a professional thief

1197
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,840
Did you delete that post?

1198
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,000
Where is my Jhansi?

1199
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,280
Bloody fools!

1200
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,280
This is too much!
Enough of this!

1201
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,880
You have no idea who I am!

1202
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,880
None of you will leave
alive from here!

1203
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,720
Got it?

1204
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,440
Hold this

1205
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,600
Lay two slaps right
on his cheek!

1206
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,720
Son of a...

1207
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,600
How dare you?

1208
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,760
Hit him

1209
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,320
You! Where's the locker?

1210
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,360
Over there

1211
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,560
You, take her

1212
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,240
Dude, keep eye on everyone.
I'll go and empty the locker

1213
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,960
Dude, are you taking her to the room?

1214
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:26,960
Shall I join?

1215
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,520
If not for the mask, I would have
spat right on your face! Get lost!

1216
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:32,720
- Dude, catch it
- That was a close call

1217
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:35,640
Hope they'll return
with the money

1218
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:38,040
Indeed. Once money is here.
We'll split it and settle down

1219
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,760
Will you use your share
and produce my movie?

1220
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,520
Why would I produce
a flop movie?

1221
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:43,320
Aren't you gonna die? Then
why do you need money?

1222
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:45,480
So you agree that if I produce a
movie with you in it, I'll die

1223
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,240
- Hey! Hey!
- Sit down! Down!

1224
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,160
There comes my hero!

1225
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,120
He will take care of
things here after!

1226
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:00,160
Excuse me, what's all this?

1227
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,120
It's all adult movies in here

1228
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,800
Then pirated DVDs

1229
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,000
Who stored all these here?

1230
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,960
Looks like Vishal is being a big trouble

1231
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,680
Hence the pirate DVD dealers got
the master copy and hid it here

1232
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,840
People are senseless!
Open the next locker!

1233
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:16,520
CCTV and hard disk?

1234
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,440
All these are hospital footage

1235
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,360
It'll come handy

1236
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,960
Let's not drag unnecessary
issues into our life. Keep it back

1237
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,360
Is it?
Ok

1238
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,440
Madam, open a locker
containing money!

1239
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,680
Open! Open!

1240
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,920
Take it out! Take all out

1241
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,080
Please don't harm me!

1242
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,360
Oh Lord Hanuman!

1243
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:38,520
I'm so scared

1244
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,400
Please don't harm me!
Please!

1245
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,160
May I come in?

1246
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,680
Are you here to deposit or withdraw?

1247
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,200
- To deposit
- Please come in

1248
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,440
- Go, sit over there
- Don't touch me

1249
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,560
I like only Kurta. No, Parda!

1250
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,640
Your joke sucks!

1251
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,080
No! Is this how you
treat a NRI customer?

1252
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:07,800
Wait and watch how I treat you

1253
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:08,840
Now, go!

1254
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,360
Looks like a huddle of Gorillas

1255
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
Hail Lord Hanuman

1256
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,320
You too have an account in Swiss bank?

1257
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,440
I guess that is why
Switzerland is so rich!

1258
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:34,080
We want the overall collection
not just today's collection

1259
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:38,040
Excuse me, this ain't just today's collection.
This is indeed the overall collection

1260
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,840
There will be hardly 10 million in this

1261
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,480
Is this why we too
such a huge risk?

1262
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,040
Let's scoot with
whatever we have

1263
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,600
Why is it so light? Wads of 5000?

1264
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,160
Move!

1265
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:49,960
The bank doesn't have
as much as we expected

1266
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,160
There's hardly 10 million in it

1267
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:54,240
Raid an ordinary councilor's
house and they get a billion!

1268
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:56,360
And you say all this
bank has is 10 million?

1269
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,400
Let's leave with whatever we got

1270
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:44,960
Shit!

1271
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:45,720
Kong!

1272
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,720
Dude, the police has
rounded up the place

1273
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,120
Yes dude.
Game over!

1274
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,800
Any information yet?

1275
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,120
Sir, not yet

1276
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,280
What's running in your mind?

1277
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:30,240
I'll handle this

1278
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,120
What happened?

1279
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:33,640
- Why are you stepping out?
- No! Please don't go out!

1280
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:47,480
"Watch out, we are coming for you"

1281
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,120
"You, won't even know who we are
why hit you"

1282
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:54,040
"Lock, cover your money inside
Run along, won't let you hide"

1283
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,560
Take one step and a person
dies inside the bank

1284
01:01:58,600 --> 01:01:59,560
Who are you?

1285
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,440
What do you want?

1286
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,680
Nothing should happen to
any of the hostages inside

1287
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,640
We'll present our demands
after deciding on it

1288
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,600
But if you guys try to
beak in before that...

1289
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,640
then you'll only
find corpses inside

1290
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:12,520
What did you just do?

1291
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,320
There are so many police and
yet you pointed gun at them?

1292
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,440
That too a dummy one

1293
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:17,640
Guys, come here

1294
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,240
What's with the football huddle?

1295
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,880
Look, Plan A didn't workout

1296
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,600
So, Plan B

1297
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:24,440
What's Plan B?

1298
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,640
Remember we watched an
English movie the other day?

1299
01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:28,760
When robbers did find money, they
placed the hostages life on line...

1300
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:29,880
and demanded money
from government

1301
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,000
- That is what we are gonna do
- Ok

1302
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,640
But if the police break
in, we'll be doomed!

1303
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,360
I feel giddy. I feel my sugar levels
are dropping. I'm about to faint

1304
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,560
Even you have a stroke,
you can't leave here!

1305
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,720
So what I said is the plan!

1306
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,840
I think he is right

1307
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,120
You will obviously think so.
You're the reason we are here

1308
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:43,360
No use talking

1309
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,240
I already feel like Lord
of the death is calling us

1310
01:02:45,320 --> 01:02:46,400
Excuse me, ladies

1311
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,040
Cover your face! Cover it!

1312
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,040
Who is this?
Looks like a big piglet

1313
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:51,560
Audience won't
laugh at this joke

1314
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,440
I'm also a thief like you all

1315
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:57,120
I steal the pension money of the elders
during the first week of every month

1316
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,840
My bad luck, I got stuck with you

1317
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,200
It's ok. If you don't mind can
you take me in your team?

1318
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,720
Damn it! We are high tech robbers! We
learnt robbery from Hollywood movies!

1319
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,360
You steal from the elders
and you wanna join us?

1320
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,560
Sir, you're Hollywood thief
and me, Kollywood thief.

1321
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:09,840
Both are thieves then why the gap?

1322
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,760
You have to threaten
people to scare them

1323
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,560
But me? People get
scared looking at me

1324
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:15,240
Isn't this qualification enough?

1325
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,000
Look at his dress color.
He is a Telugu actor!

1326
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,560
I'll be sitting over there.
Call me, if you need me

1327
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,280
Get lost!

1328
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,840
Forget about him

1329
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,040
How much should we demand?

1330
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,240
Hold on!

1331
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,440
Shooting, posters, cut-out and a pay
for the reviewers, I need 50 million

1332
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:29,840
So, 50 million per head

1333
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:30,800
90 million in total

1334
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:33,000
Doofus! How does 50 million per
head add up to 90 million?

1335
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:35,200
- 225 million! Isn't it?
- Then 225 million!

1336
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,400
So, ready with you demands?

1337
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,520
Go ahead, ask!

1338
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:44,160
There are 18 lives inside

1339
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:45,760
If they must make
it out safe then...

1340
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:47,840
pay us 200 million and we'll leave
without creating any issues

1341
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,000
200 million?

1342
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,480
Any idea how many zeros it has?

1343
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:55,800
Err...no...we don't know

1344
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:57,520
If you don't meet our
demand and pay us up...

1345
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:00,040
then every half an hour a
person dies inside the bank

1346
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,360
One, two, three...

1347
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,080
Sir he is counting down...

1348
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,440
What if he goes in
and shoots anybody?

1349
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:07,240
Please don't harm anyone

1350
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:09,160
- Eight zeros!
- What?

1351
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:10,240
Eight zeros?

1352
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:11,760
20 million has eight zeros in it

1353
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,040
This ain't a game, dear

1354
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,680
And that is why don't
take us lightly

1355
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,400
So stop acting smart and
instead go, arrange the money

1356
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:19,760
I'm going back in, now

1357
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:20,880
- What's wrong with him?
- Sir?

1358
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:22,280
He bids good bye as if we
are here to see him off!

1359
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,480
They don't seem to be
professional thieves

1360
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,000
How about we break in
and gun them down?

1361
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,160
No! No! No!

1362
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,800
We can even follow what the
professionals are up to

1363
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:32,440
but such amateurs are
very difficult to handle

1364
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,880
What if they do something crazy in fear?
Remember, there are hostages inside

1365
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:40,480
Yes sir. Tell me

1366
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,960
Have you brought the bank
surroundings under your control?

1367
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,800
Yes sir

1368
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,880
We don't know how
many are there inside

1369
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:47,640
Their demand is 200 million

1370
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,480
We are waiting for
you to make a decision

1371
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,280
I'll let you know after consulting
with the higher officials

1372
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:52,040
Ok sir

1373
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:53,480
Their demand is 200 million

1374
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:54,920
It's election time

1375
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:57,120
Sir, there is not even a clue about
them in the intelligence report

1376
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,000
Yes

1377
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:01,200
But at Home Secretariat it'll go
down as a miss from our side

1378
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:09,200
Do one thing. Collect all the details of the
robberies involving Parda, mask and guns

1379
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,320
This usage of Parda; could it be a
strategy to ignite a religion riots?

1380
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,360
May be

1381
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,320
First thing...

1382
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:16,760
Ensure the media doesn't
make a big issue out of it

1383
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:19,160
- Please move, sir! Move!
- Please move!

1384
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,680
Robbers who broke into the
bank at Vandalur in Chennai...

1385
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,040
threatened the bank staffs at gun point and
now the police have rounded the bank up

1386
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,280
Robbers broke into BOH bank...

1387
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:29,880
when they realized there
was no money in bank...

1388
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:34,320
they took the bank staffs and the bank
customers present over there, as hostages

1389
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,640
Now, they have demanded
a sum of 200 million rupees

1390
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,320
Holy guacamole! If this is the case, how
will people deposit money in the bank?

1391
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,720
Robbers have broke inside a
bank in the broad daylight

1392
01:05:42,800 --> 01:05:46,760
Bank is place where we think our money
is safe but the bank itself isn't safe!

1393
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,520
Come here buddy! Come here!
Come on, buddy!

1394
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,360
What are you doing
with these robbers?

1395
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,040
- It's all because of him
- Hey, look at this

1396
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,640
Lets buy a bungalow in Anna Nagar once
we start our pickpocketing business

1397
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:59,240
I will build a house along
with a tree in the garden

1398
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,840
The tree is for you
to play all day long

1399
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:02,280
- Do you remember this scene?
- Which one?

1400
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,080
The movies where the lost
brothers unite during climax

1401
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:06,680
Yes

1402
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,760
This is exactly that

1403
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,480
No Kong, everyone is watching

1404
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,480
Hey Kong, Come here

1405
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,880
If he were a girl, we could
have got Kong married to him

1406
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:14,160
That's enough, come here

1407
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:17,000
Kong, please!
Don't leave me

1408
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:20,080
Stop singing and go,
sit over there!

1409
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,080
Don't touch!

1410
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,480
I am coming from India, I have
come to deposit 2 billion

1411
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,280
- Show me the money!
- What?!

1412
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:27,080
- Did you say 2 billion?
- Yes!

1413
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:27,960
2 Billion!

1414
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,560
He reminds me of Vijay Antony
from Pichaikkaran movie

1415
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,760
Don't get on my nerves.
Go and sit there!

1416
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,120
He is mentally unstable, sir

1417
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:37,200
I had a doubt after seeing
this peculiar hairstyle!

1418
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,240
- Hey! He meant that guy!
- His also mentally unstable?

1419
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,840
I doubt if this is a
bank or a mental asylum

1420
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:46,160
Sir, he often comes here in the
name of depositing a billion or two

1421
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,360
He won't leave until the bank accepts
his challan and gives a receipt

1422
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:50,520
He will leave once
he gets the receipt

1423
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,440
Hey, what are you both
retards discussing?

1424
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:56,160
Wait, he is doing the calculations.
The sum has gone more than 5 billion

1425
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,200
Confirm!

1426
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,560
According to him, he is a
successful politician from India

1427
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,120
And thinks that his job is to deposit
the looted money in Swiss bank

1428
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,320
- For him, this is his Swiss bank
- Swiss bank?

1429
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,200
I got to board my flight to
India and it’s getting late

1430
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:10,600
Once I reach India, call
me from Switzerland

1431
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,840
Why should I call you?

1432
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:13,440
Only then will I know
that I have reached India

1433
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:16,240
I agree that you are mentally unstable.
Do not confirm it time and again

1434
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,320
I have come across many mentally
unstable people but he is peculiar

1435
01:07:19,360 --> 01:07:22,520
This is how most of the
rich people in India are!

1436
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,000
These robbers escaped after their
robbery in Kolkata 2 years before

1437
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:33,360
They seem to have killed 8 of their hostages
as the demanded ransom was delayed

1438
01:07:33,400 --> 01:07:34,040
Who is this?

1439
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,680
This robbery happened
in Mumbai, last year

1440
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,640
During the shootout, 3 of them were shot and
one of them is spending his time in jail

1441
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,080
Do you think we can
escape from this place?

1442
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:44,360
- I am scared!!
- Hey!!!

1443
01:07:46,920 --> 01:07:47,880
Hands up!

1444
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,360
- I surrender!!
- Fool!

1445
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,480
Why are you surrendering
despite being armed?

1446
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,400
He's got the original
gun unlike ours

1447
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,320
- Only we know the truth. He doesn't know
- Come on, my hero!

1448
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,640
What's up? Closing in, is it?

1449
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,520
Son of Venghai has
arrived all by himself!

1450
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,760
If you have guts, all of you go face him!

1451
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:05,080
- How dare you tease our superstar?
- Hit him!

1452
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:06,960
I think you are from the Viswaroopam
team and that's why you are mad at me

1453
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:07,880
Shut up you 'Nest-Head'

1454
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,920
Ask the security to put down his gun

1455
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:11,920
Security!! Drop your gun

1456
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:20,280
Are we playing heist game?
Let me be the cop

1457
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,480
The gun is loaded

1458
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,840
Snatch the gun
from that retard!

1459
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,160
Hands up! I am going to
shoot each one of you

1460
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:28,240
She has got hold of my gun!

1461
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:30,720
Let go of the gun!
Hey! Let me go!

1462
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,120
He is shooting like crazy!

1463
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,360
- Catch him!
- Sir, I am the driver for your airplane

1464
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,320
Run driver or else my bullet
will get you, you Bull !

1465
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:38,720
Hey! Let me go!

1466
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:44,080
Let go of the gun!
Allow me to do my duty!

1467
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:47,960
Please do not hurt
any of the hostages

1468
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,680
We shall oblige to your demands

1469
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,320
Jhansi, come on

1470
01:08:53,360 --> 01:08:53,920
This way

1471
01:08:53,960 --> 01:09:00,120
(Song from Tamil Movie 'New')

1472
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,640
Hey! Hey! Watch out!

1473
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:04,400
What's happening here?

1474
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:06,400
Excuse me! Having a
sandwich massage?

1475
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:08,560
What is Jhansi doing over there?

1476
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,840
If you take my place,
the lady underneath will die!

1477
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,280
At least give me some
space on the side

1478
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,160
Give me the gun!
Give me the gun!

1479
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,120
Dude, he isn't listening
to me in the first place!

1480
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:17,800
I have been wanting this for long.
Please

1481
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:18,680
Get lost!

1482
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:20,160
Let go of me! I'm the cop here!

1483
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,880
Stop it with such activities. Even
I lost my control. Go, sit there

1484
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,920
- Dude, how did she get out?
- Hope our teammates are fine

1485
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:26,240
Yes. Look, he seems
to have doubts

1486
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:27,720
Why are you guys talking
in a woman's voice?

1487
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:28,760
Uh-oh! He found it out!

1488
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:31,280
Hey, what's wrong with you?
Why are you lying like this?

1489
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:31,840
Venkat...

1490
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,560
- Dude, don't press in the wrong places
- Wake up! Venkat!

1491
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:36,400
Venkat!

1492
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:38,320
- Dude, get up!
- Wake up!

1493
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,280
- What happened to him?
- What happened?

1494
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,760
Venkat!

1495
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,280
- Dude! Dude!
- Buddy?

1496
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,400
What happened to you?
Wake up, man!

1497
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,120
Hey, Venkat!

1498
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:50,120
Jiiva?

1499
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,920
I thought, one share less but
looks like you are back alive

1500
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,960
This guard saved me

1501
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,440
See that? It's the guard
that saved him now!

1502
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:06,640
Indeed dude. The guard saved you.
You have a good life line

1503
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,600
Thanks to the guard

1504
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,880
Uh-oh Jhansi!

1505
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,160
Do you want the guard?

1506
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,040
Your face is exposed, then what's
with the woman's voice? You're busted

1507
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:15,320
Why did you remove the mask?

1508
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:16,760
Fine, at least let
me hide my face

1509
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:17,560
Jiiva!

1510
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,360
Hope you know what a big
blunder you're committing

1511
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:21,240
What made you take
such an extreme step?

1512
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,400
And I trusted you!

1513
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:24,720
Do you know what?
He isn't a doctor too!

1514
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:28,760
Don't you have a heart?

1515
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,920
How could you cheat me?

1516
01:10:29,960 --> 01:10:30,520
Fraud!

1517
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,800
Whom are you calling a fraud?

1518
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,040
You claim to love me but roam around
with another guy! You're fraud!

1519
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,640
I need to hear this from you
for sincerely loving you

1520
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,040
Shut up!

1521
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,880
Girls like you have made a
habit of cheating guys like me

1522
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:43,560
Because I'm poor and he is rich!

1523
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,480
Of course! You eat but
he fills his stomach!

1524
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:47,480
- Get lost!
- Aiyo!

1525
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,200
Dare you or else
I'll break you jaws!

1526
01:10:49,240 --> 01:10:50,880
Jhansi you have such cheap friends?

1527
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:51,920
Do you know who I am?

1528
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,800
Who in the hell is he?
Keeps repeating the same question!

1529
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:54,360
Jiiva!

1530
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:55,080
Get lost!

1531
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,280
Move! Get lost!

1532
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:58,360
- Come here
- Sit down

1533
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,920
Dude, why were you so mean to her?

1534
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:05,680
React even worse when you
know a girl is about to react

1535
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:06,840
Sounds like a good idea!

1536
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,440
Let that be...

1537
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,480
Why did you tell her I'm not a doctor?

1538
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,200
Now you won't have another
issue to deal with her, right?

1539
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:14,640
Thank me. I've helped you!

1540
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:16,560
What happened? Did he slap you?

1541
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:17,800
Yes

1542
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,040
Those two, one in green Parda and
the other in red Parda, they hit me

1543
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,160
How about we bash them
up together, as a team?

1544
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,040
Listen, I'm one of them

1545
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,480
You guys are messing with
me without knowing who I am

1546
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,440
Didn't they beat for
saying the same thing?

1547
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:30,440
Shut up!

1548
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:32,040
Listen, baby...

1549
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,880
How tall are you?
Around 3 feet 4 inches?

1550
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:35,920
I'll remove my slippers and slap you!

1551
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,760
Remove it and you'll
be on 2 feet 2 inches

1552
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:39,440
- Driver! What is this?
- What?

1553
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:41,760
It's a sweet bowl.
Keep it safe with you

1554
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,080
Pack it in my luggage that
I'll be carrying in the flight

1555
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:45,480
Here! Take it!

1556
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,400
- Dude! Dude! Come here
- What is it?

1557
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:52,520
He is hurt.
let's help him.

1558
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,520
What happened to him?

1559
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:55,160
- Lift him
- No, I won't come! Leave me!

1560
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:55,880
Come on, now!

1561
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:57,440
- Come on! You're shot!
- Leave me!

1562
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,120
- You're hurt so bad! Come on!
- Leave me!

1563
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:00,600
I don't care, even if it's
at the cost of my life...

1564
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:02,800
I won't let you take
a penny from here!

1565
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,720
Shit!

1566
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:05,600
This right here is the difference
between the poor and the rich!

1567
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,160
Show the gun and the manager
let's us loot all the money

1568
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:09,240
But the poor...

1569
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:11,640
The poor will remain poor forever

1570
01:12:11,680 --> 01:12:13,760
Not the time, dude. He is bleeding.
He might die

1571
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,600
He might die and then
this will become an issue

1572
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,680
What shall we do now?

1573
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:22,440
- He is stepping out!
- That too without the mask!

1574
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:28,200
So you are the culprit!

1575
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:32,840
He looks familiar

1576
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,520
People call him the 'Lucky charm' doctor

1577
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:36,760
That's him

1578
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,360
I heard a gunshot inside

1579
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:39,920
Whom did you shoot?

1580
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,200
One of them was showing
off too much...

1581
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,280
hence, we shot him

1582
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:45,080
Sir!

1583
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,920
There is no risk to his life

1584
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:48,240
Please bring in some doctor

1585
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,280
So, isn't he a doctor?

1586
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:52,000
He is robbing the bank. Isn't that
enough to prove that he is a fraud

1587
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:52,880
Listen!

1588
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,840
What are you guys up to?

1589
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:57,080
Bring out the one who is hurt

1590
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,520
First ensure you meet our demand

1591
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,600
Delay more and this is what will happen

1592
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:02,920
- Get lost!
- How dare you?

1593
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:04,720
- Take a hike!
- What? How dare...

1594
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,400
Sir, he just insulted you!

1595
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:08,280
- Call up the ambulance first!
- Sure sir

1596
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:11,200
Bank robbery update: Since there is a
delay in meeting the robber's demand...

1597
01:13:11,240 --> 01:13:14,080
the information is that a
person was shot inside

1598
01:13:14,120 --> 01:13:16,520
And we're expecting him
not to be dead, so far

1599
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,760
Why are you all standing as if
the national anthem is played?

1600
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,880
It's lunch time

1601
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,720
Come to office at your own timing but
maintain punctuality for such breaks!

1602
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:28,160
You're working in a bank right?

1603
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,200
Why do you dress like you're
working in a massage parlour?

1604
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:34,200
What's that on your back? Dirt?
Don't you take bath?

1605
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:35,680
- That's a tattoo
- Show me

1606
01:13:35,720 --> 01:13:38,560
- I already saw it. It's an eagle tattoo
- Let me also check it out

1607
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:41,120
All of lives are on the cliffhanger...

1608
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,480
and you want to have lunch?

1609
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:43,840
I'll shoot all of you down!

1610
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,160
Staffs, step forward. Come on

1611
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,320
Kneel down! Kneel down!

1612
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,280
You guys make our life hell that
starts right from filling up a challan

1613
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:51,880
Blame Digital India...

1614
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:53,800
they ask Aadhar ID proof
even at the rest rooms!

1615
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,320
Let's make in India

1616
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,280
You've been talking alone for a long time.
I'll break your jaws

1617
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,440
Toy face!

1618
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:01,160
Whom are you staring at?

1619
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:03,120
Arrogance of being a bank employee.
Isn't it?

1620
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,120
They are the staffs.
Don't insult them

1621
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,480
We're insulting them?

1622
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:09,640
You don't believe customers to an extent where
you even tie the glass tumbler with a chain

1623
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,320
5 rupees pen and you tie
it down with a thread

1624
01:14:12,360 --> 01:14:15,080
And those who owe you millions of billion?
You let them escape to foreign!

1625
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:18,160
They even make the elder's, who are
here for pension, wait for a long time

1626
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,600
Don't drag your problems into this

1627
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,960
You don't know how long I wait
outside to snatch it from them!

1628
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,040
Not just that.

1629
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,520
We come to city so that we can
make a new address for ourselves

1630
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,000
When we come to open an account, you guys
pester us asking for I proof and address proof

1631
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:30,400
What if you take loan
and run away to foreign?

1632
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:33,080
Didn't you get address
proof from Vijay Mallaya?

1633
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,360
Answer him Mr. Sharp Nose

1634
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:36,840
You think smoothly you can
become one of us? Go, sit down

1635
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:37,640
Well, no...

1636
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:38,960
Come on.
Let's sit together

1637
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,840
She'll sit later.
You go, sit there

1638
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:44,520
Hey! Where's Kong?

1639
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:46,520
That monkey must be here somewhere

1640
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:49,880
Dare you call it a monkey!

1641
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,480
Why did you call it a monkey?

1642
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,440
Then how else do you
address a monkey?

1643
01:15:36,160 --> 01:15:39,240
If anyone triggers a gun shot...

1644
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,440
I'll finish you off!

1645
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:44,200
Bro! Are you safe?

1646
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,840
Who are you?

1647
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,960
Can't you see? Look we are already friends.
I'm one of you

1648
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,480
Bro, come let's go chat with
the manager lady. She is alone

1649
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:52,480
Aunty...

1650
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,760
Look, he is carrying it
like he is his mother

1651
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,640
Situation becomes intense in Vandalur

1652
01:15:56,680 --> 01:15:57,920
Since, there is a delay
in paying the ransom...

1653
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,360
the robbers shot one of the hostages

1654
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:02,880
Daring robber who stepped
out without the mask

1655
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:06,600
The police has now closed the
file, looking for the robbers

1656
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:09,720
Let's find our more from our reporter

1657
01:16:09,800 --> 01:16:11,160
Dressed as a doctor, a police...

1658
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,320
See that, we are the
headlines in all the channel

1659
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:17,360
I bet there will be a channel
that will play 'Kumki' even now

1660
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,440
Try that!

1661
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:20,280
Whoa!

1662
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,560
I've watched some thousand times

1663
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,440
They're playing this movie
for the millionth time!

1664
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:24,480
Look here comes an ape

1665
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:28,080
They earn all their ratings either playing this
movie or with the shows with this anchor DD

1666
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,320
But I like this anchor very much

1667
01:16:29,360 --> 01:16:30,360
Drunken drive, isn't it?

1668
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,360
How do you know that she got
caught in a Drunken drive case

1669
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,440
I meant you dude

1670
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:36,120
- This guy's the best !!!
- He is having the time of his life!

1671
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,000
No comments!

1672
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,160
- Why?
- I'm a diehard fan of his

1673
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:42,400
- He’s lying
- Shut up, guys!

1674
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:45,320
- Aiy-aiyo! Police! Police is here!
- That's the ambulance

1675
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:50,040
Note that a government doctor is making his
way in to the bank. This is a bit strange

1676
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,440
Sir, ambulance arrived

1677
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,120
Yeah

1678
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:52,960
Ok.
Over sir.

1679
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:54,360
Please, go check

1680
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:06,520
Stop!

1681
01:17:08,320 --> 01:17:09,560
Open it

1682
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,480
- Vincent
- Sir?

1683
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,320
- Find out who are these two
- Ok sir

1684
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,040
Move

1685
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:37,120
Can you hear me, Rajesh?

1686
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:38,840
You have the advantage of the situation

1687
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,080
Use it correctly

1688
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,400
Ramalingam, get both their footage

1689
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:27,120
From where did the monkey
come inside the bank?

1690
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,320
Dude, you handle the stunts!

1691
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:14,320
Come on!

1692
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,240
Move! How dare you attack us?

1693
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,240
Kong, you carry on

1694
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,240
Keep moving!

1695
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,920
Watch out.

1696
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:28,960
Careful!

1697
01:19:30,200 --> 01:19:31,320
Send him here

1698
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,400
Move!

1699
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,560
Sir, one second.
I'll get back to you

1700
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:48,240
Sir, move!

1701
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,000
How dare you send in a police?

1702
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,040
Do we look like jokers to you?

1703
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,640
You guys play tricks thinking we can't
do anything about it. Isn't it?

1704
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,800
Wait and watch, we'll
show our true power now

1705
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:08,280
- Step back!
- Look, it's a bomb!

1706
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,160
- Run! Let's back off
- He is wired!

1707
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,080
Look at him...he is wired!

1708
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,320
This is five kilos.
There are three more inside

1709
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,560
In total, 20 kilos.
If it explodes...

1710
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,600
everything will burnt down to ashes
in a radius of half a kilometer

1711
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,480
How dare you send in a police!

1712
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:31,320
Let me also remove it

1713
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,600
It's so stuffy!

1714
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,000
Time to fly down to India

1715
01:20:37,680 --> 01:20:39,320
Oh shame!

1716
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,440
- What's the time?
- 7:30

1717
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:45,480
Kong, what are your eyes fixed on?

1718
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:47,080
You wanna press the red button?

1719
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,920
It's a dummy bomb. Doesn't matter
who presses the button. Come on

1720
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:51,080
Come, press it

1721
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,600
It's so hot outside. You
also removed the attire?

1722
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,680
How did you find out
he was not a doctor?

1723
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:00,440
He was dressing the wound
like I used to do it

1724
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,960
Look at that! You found it out
because you were also a fraud doctor

1725
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,200
Yes, dude

1726
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,480
Why is the counter running
only in your timer?

1727
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,080
Because my good time has started

1728
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,760
Ok, go stand there!

1729
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:10,480
Come, let's go

1730
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,920
Everyone where terrified
at the sight of the bomb

1731
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:13,920
Jealous guys!

1732
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:18,240
Sir, the situation is getting worse here

1733
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,000
All the four robbers have
strapped a bomb to their bodies

1734
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:22,880
Before anything bad happens...

1735
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:24,840
we must meet their demands!

1736
01:21:24,920 --> 01:21:27,640
Please discuss with the higher authorities
and come to an amicable conclusion

1737
01:21:27,680 --> 01:21:30,720
I think it would be better if we consult
the Chief Minister before moving further

1738
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:31,520
Yes, sir

1739
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,400
Sir, they are demanding
a ransom of 200 million

1740
01:21:39,040 --> 01:21:41,680
There are suicide bombers
inside who threaten to blow up

1741
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:45,920
The special task force would
be very helpful right now

1742
01:21:45,960 --> 01:21:48,680
What's the hurry?
Don't wield that weapon now

1743
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:50,640
It'll be the government
and not you in danger

1744
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,640
Let's settle the ransom for now

1745
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,120
Later, we can finish them off

1746
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:55,120
Yes, sir

1747
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:56,200
Will do that, sir

1748
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,200
Dude, when will the money come?

1749
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:05,120
Good, Only now are you involved in the job

1750
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,600
I was wondering if we could
order dinner, if it gets late

1751
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,080
- Food is all he thinks about. Glutton!
- I'm hungry!

1752
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:12,120
Hello!

1753
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,880
- Yes sir?
- Thalappakatti Biriyani hotel?

1754
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,560
- Yes sir
- Is the biriyani fresh and hot?

1755
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,800
Pack hot lunch for 30 people

1756
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,080
Add some appetizers and desserts too

1757
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:20,200
Delivery address?

1758
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,280
This place is the talk of
the town at current hour!

1759
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:25,440
Hindustan bank is the place to deliver.
Pack for 30 people and come soon

1760
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:26,840
May I know who is speaking?

1761
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,480
Whose name shall I use?

1762
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:29,200
Police

1763
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:31,400
- Quick tell me?
- Use Assistant Commissioner's name

1764
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,400
I'm the AC, Shanmugam.
Come soon.

1765
01:22:33,440 --> 01:22:35,480
- Ask for extra Curd Onion?
- Curd Onion is it?

1766
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,760
He has disconnected the call

1767
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,000
There is no shame when
somebody is paying the bill

1768
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,160
Food is on the way dude!

1769
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:41,440
- Hey wait!
- What now?

1770
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,400
The count is only 20 here

1771
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,840
Why did you order for 30 people

1772
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,360
Sorry, but extra 10 is for me

1773
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,680
That doesn't seem fair

1774
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:49,360
Three for me and seven for you

1775
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:52,120
No way. Three for you
and seven for me

1776
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:53,680
That's what I said

1777
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,120
I am the one who ordered, I
should be the one who orders

1778
01:22:56,160 --> 01:22:57,680
Forget that. Do you want
'Beeda' for dessert?

1779
01:22:57,720 --> 01:23:00,120
I know a guy from Thiruvanmiyur
who makes excellent Beedas

1780
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,320
It’s so tasty that you'll
spit it back on his face

1781
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,160
- Hey!
- What?

1782
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,760
- We are not here for a feast
- Then?

1783
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,200
Go and grab the lunch first

1784
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:11,560
Sir...

1785
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:12,720
Show this

1786
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:14,280
He was working in an I.T company

1787
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:16,280
Later, he was fired

1788
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,360
He is a fraud doctor.
His name is Jiiva

1789
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:20,920
Sir, he is Venkat

1790
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,160
His dream is to become a movie star

1791
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:24,280
But for now he is jobless

1792
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:25,920
We haven't found much
details about him yet

1793
01:23:25,960 --> 01:23:28,080
- Find if there is any link between them
- Ok sir

1794
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,360
- Make way please! Make way!
- Hey who is that?

1795
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,680
- Hey, where are you going?
- Hey! Hey!

1796
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:36,440
- Sir, I got to deliver the Biriyani
- No way

1797
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,760
It was Assistant Commissioner
who ordered these!

1798
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:40,440
Sir!

1799
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,280
Biriyanis for you

1800
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,280
Who ordered?

1801
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,640
I was told that you are
the one who called

1802
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:46,280
Stop kidding and get away

1803
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,680
- Get lost idiot!
- Sorry sir!

1804
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,840
Get lost man!

1805
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:51,920
- Hello!
- Hello sir!

1806
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:53,200
- Have you reached the place?
- I am near the barricade sir

1807
01:23:53,240 --> 01:23:55,720
The deliver guy has come. Go and fetch
the lunch from him

1808
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,120
A dude with bomb attached to his chest
will come. Hand over the lunch to him

1809
01:23:58,160 --> 01:23:59,560
- Go outside and fetch the lunch.
- Hey!

1810
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:00,960
- I said, go!
- Listen to me

1811
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,760
Test the lunch for poison
before giving it to us

1812
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:03,960
I will be dead if its poisoned

1813
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,560
- I don't think poison can kill you
- Says a poisonous fellow

1814
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:10,360
- What is the thermocol for?
- To save myself from the bullets.

1815
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:11,560
Looks like he is from Sellur

1816
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:13,080
At least I stopped with
a demonstration, you

1817
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:15,080
named the person, you
are a dead meat now

1818
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:18,640
Thermocol again?

1819
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,880
AC sir, I'm about to reveal myself

1820
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,000
Biriyani is for us. Send it in

1821
01:24:26,040 --> 01:24:27,160
Come here

1822
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,080
Myself?

1823
01:24:28,120 --> 01:24:29,360
Look, how arrogant he is

1824
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:30,600
- Come here
- Wait, sir

1825
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,600
He look strange.
Resembles gorilla a lot

1826
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:40,560
A thermocol is enough to scare you guys.
Which is why they are having fun inside

1827
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:41,440
Hello, sir

1828
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:42,920
It was just a thermocol

1829
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:43,880
Give it to me

1830
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,480
- Did you pack the appetizers?
- Sir, the bill

1831
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:47,320
- Sir will pay along with the tax
- Who? Me?

1832
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:49,080
- Hey!
- Sorry sir

1833
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:50,880
You have been standing
here since morning

1834
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,240
Here, you both share this

1835
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:53,200
Sit by the jeep and eat

1836
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:54,680
- You!
- What is it?

1837
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:56,880
I can only spare one. There
are many people inside

1838
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:58,240
Catch him

1839
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,640
Uh-oh! There are 30 of them here already

1840
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,120
- Sir...
- Look...

1841
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:04,280
All other robbers have
removed their monkey masks!

1842
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:05,560
Why haven't you removed it yet?

1843
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,320
Mask?

1844
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,240
Sir, this is not a mask

1845
01:25:08,280 --> 01:25:10,240
- This is my original face!
- Remove your mask!

1846
01:25:10,280 --> 01:25:11,600
I swear! This is my face

1847
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,120
- I said, remove it
- Sir, please listen to me

1848
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:14,960
- I said, remove it
- Cut your nails, sir!

1849
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:16,600
He just poked my eyes!

1850
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:17,600
Sir!

1851
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,080
I spared a biriyani for you and is
this how you thank me in return?

1852
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:21,000
You better get retired

1853
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,520
Sir, he just asked you to get retired!

1854
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,800
Are you on their side or mine?

1855
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,520
A police fires gun but this guy
seems to like ripping faces

1856
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:26,600
Alas, he has come!

1857
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:28,120
- What took you so long?
- Gone!

1858
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,440
Gone? Who? You? Then how
come you are alive?

1859
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,920
I meant a pack of biriyani is gone.
They flicked it

1860
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:31,880
How bad of them!

1861
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:33,720
- Six for you and three for me!
- Ok

1862
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,800
Ten farmers suicide on the same day

1863
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,200
Tragedy at Thiruvalluvar

1864
01:25:46,240 --> 01:25:52,880
Including Murugan, a total of ten farmers
from Thiruvalluvar committed suicide today

1865
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:56,200
The whole state is saddened by this

1866
01:25:57,680 --> 01:25:58,880
Mu..Muruga!

1867
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:01,360
Murugadas!

1868
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,680
Hey! You!

1869
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,440
What do you think you're doing?

1870
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:16,600
Stop this foolishness

1871
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,000
Everything's falling in place

1872
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:19,400
You retard!

1873
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,760
My friend is the
reason I'm alive today

1874
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,280
He pacified me and sent me to
Chennai to look out for loan

1875
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,720
But today, he committed
suicide due to loan shark!

1876
01:26:27,800 --> 01:26:30,520
- I don't deserve to live!
- Hey! Stop!

1877
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,480
Suicide, that is all you know!

1878
01:26:32,520 --> 01:26:34,440
You think your death
will change everything

1879
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,160
Just like this, when
I was working...

1880
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:38,520
A farmer died and quit that profession

1881
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:41,200
Do farmer's think committing
suicide is a fashion statement?

1882
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:43,320
My dad died because of debts

1883
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,880
Which is why I became
a fraud like this

1884
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,800
Die and your children
will turn into frauds

1885
01:26:48,520 --> 01:26:50,880
Can't you take up any other
profession if not agriculture?

1886
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,560
We have many profession to take up

1887
01:26:54,160 --> 01:26:55,520
What about your food?

1888
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,360
Farmers are the only generous
people in this world!

1889
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:03,960
But we aren't allowed to fix a price
on the products that we give away

1890
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:08,880
You guys think that farmers are protesting
and fighting for their own rights

1891
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:13,720
But they are fighting for you
and everyone in this world

1892
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,640
Why don't you guys
understand this fact?

1893
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:20,360
No honest farmer will be
as selfish as any of you

1894
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,040
We fight till our last breath...

1895
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:26,240
We are sacrificing our
lives to save agriculture!

1896
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:28,560
But we unable to do it

1897
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,440
But...

1898
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,960
I stepped apart and became selfish

1899
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,240
And here I'm with you
guys, robbing a bank!

1900
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,520
I am ashamed of myself!

1901
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:42,480
Fine. Forget it

1902
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:45,480
What is that you want?

1903
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:49,600
Can I make a demand?

1904
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:52,720
That's it? Just come out and
demand whatever you want

1905
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:55,520
Instead stop crying like a kid

1906
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:56,800
Come on

1907
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,040
The government will
accept all our demands

1908
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,280
Just demand what you want

1909
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:03,480
- Jiiva, listen to me
- Jhansi!

1910
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:04,480
You don't need this

1911
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:05,880
You're committing a blunder

1912
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,200
Please, you don't need this!

1913
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:09,120
I'll knock you down dead! Get lost!

1914
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:11,240
How dare you abuse
Jhansi in front of me?

1915
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,880
Do you have any idea who I am?

1916
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:14,560
Are you actor Sarath Babu's son?

1917
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:17,280
You'll tremble in fear if
you find out who my dad is

1918
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:20,000
I have been meaning
to ask from long back

1919
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:21,240
Tell me, who is your father?

1920
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,680
He is our company MD's son

1921
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:24,480
We were here regarding signing up a loan

1922
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:25,520
Not just that

1923
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,320
His father is central minister Ramaiah

1924
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:29,880
- So, you have two fathers?
- Can't you understand Tamil?

1925
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:31,400
- Greetings sir
- Minister's son?

1926
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,120
Now watch how you
demand will be met!

1927
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,680
Darling, come here

1928
01:28:36,720 --> 01:28:37,320
Sir, please go

1929
01:28:37,400 --> 01:28:39,160
Jiiva, what are you gonna do?

1930
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,480
Jhansi, I'll take care

1931
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,080
Why didn't you mention
it before, dear?

1932
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:43,440
Like you guys let me speak!

1933
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,520
Every time I spoke you guys
hit me right on my face!

1934
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:46,960
Fine, I'm leaving.
Come on, Jhansi

1935
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,400
Where are you off to? You
part is yet to begin

1936
01:28:49,440 --> 01:28:50,440
Give me the bomb jacket

1937
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:52,160
I won't give mine.
Use yours

1938
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,480
Jiiva, what are you gonna do?

1939
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,000
Jiiva, please no!

1940
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:57,120
- What's your plan?
- Take her away

1941
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:58,840
- Listen, you go sit there
- Jiiva, please listen to me

1942
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:00,160
Why are you removing your shirt?

1943
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:02,360
- Jhansi, go sit there. Go!
- Jiiva!

1944
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:04,240
Jiiva, please don't do this! Jiiva!

1945
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:06,960
- Can't you hear me?
- Jiiva!

1946
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:13,640
Remember darling, the
remote is in my pocket

1947
01:29:13,680 --> 01:29:16,800
Act smart, I'll press it
and it will be game over!

1948
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,600
Sir! Greetings!

1949
01:29:19,960 --> 01:29:20,600
What's up, sir?

1950
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,080
Look! That's our son!

1951
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:26,680
Aiy-aiyo! Please do something!
I am really worried

1952
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:28,240
Just go to your room! Go!

1953
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,240
Mic! I need a mic

1954
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,480
- Come, let's go with our mics
- Stop! Step back!

1955
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:34,120
Bring that one

1956
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:37,480
Mr. Farmer, make sure you
demand a huge ransom

1957
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:39,680
Just place your mics and come back. Go!

1958
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:40,680
Ok sir

1959
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:43,040
- Sir, please state all details
- Please state all your demands

1960
01:29:43,120 --> 01:29:46,360
Sir, the guy in the middle
looks quite familiar

1961
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,400
I have seen him frequently around

1962
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:51,800
You guys set police on us even after
there are 18 hostages' lives in danger

1963
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:53,520
You're delaying to pay us up

1964
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:56,200
All because none of those
lives matter to you

1965
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:58,520
That's the respect you
have for ordinary people's life

1966
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:02,080
You won't question the mystery behind the
hundreds of fishermen die in Rameshwaram

1967
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:06,040
But two people die inside the Taj
hotel and you make it a global headlines

1968
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,120
Because causalities aren't
a big deal to you...

1969
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,800
the real deal is who
are the causalities!

1970
01:30:13,040 --> 01:30:15,640
So, now we have a hostage whose
life will matter to you!

1971
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:17,680
Darling, step forward

1972
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:19,240
He is...

1973
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:21,920
central minister, Ramaiah's son

1974
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,240
There's the twist in the plot!

1975
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:30,320
- Your dad must be watching this
- Ok, I'll speak

1976
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:31,040
Say 'Hi' to him

1977
01:30:31,080 --> 01:30:33,840
Dad, they bashed me up inside

1978
01:30:33,880 --> 01:30:34,680
Didn't you bash me?

1979
01:30:34,720 --> 01:30:37,440
Sir, he is my colleague.
Looks like he has a demand

1980
01:30:37,520 --> 01:30:38,040
Come on

1981
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:39,600
Why is he acting strange?

1982
01:30:39,640 --> 01:30:41,000
I didn't get a chance to speak

1983
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:44,680
Please forgive us all. There is no other
option for us other than committing suicide

1984
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:47,680
Aiy-aiyo!

1985
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:49,360
He has turned on the bomb man

1986
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,800
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready to die!

1987
01:30:50,880 --> 01:30:52,480
What is your problem?
Just say it!

1988
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:53,280
Sir

1989
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:56,360
We don't need the 200 million
that we demanded earlier

1990
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:57,520
Move aside

1991
01:30:57,880 --> 01:30:58,960
Hey Mr. Farmer, what happened?

1992
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,120
Instead of that, please waive off
all the farmers' loan in the state

1993
01:31:02,160 --> 01:31:03,200
Let the farmers live

1994
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:06,000
If you let the farmers die, the very
backbone of the country will be shaken

1995
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,440
I plead you!

1996
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:11,840
If you do that, we will
surrender ourselves

1997
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:15,600
Waive off the farmers' loan

1998
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:18,400
Is it possible for the
government to do that?

1999
01:31:18,440 --> 01:31:20,160
It doesn't matter how, but
please waive off the loans

2000
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:22,720
Do you think it is possible
for our government to do that?

2001
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,920
Please hear me out! Let me speak!

2002
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:28,320
Hey! Don't shout!

2003
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:29,760
- Sir, shall I take leave!
- Save the farmers

2004
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:31,720
- Hey, come inside
- Please let me go

2005
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,000
- Hey!
- Give me a minute, sir!

2006
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:35,280
- List your demands first
- Why the soft corner towards farmers?

2007
01:31:35,320 --> 01:31:37,800
Sir, you better demand some
money, this seems unrealistic

2008
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,800
Cut it out!

2009
01:31:40,240 --> 01:31:41,560
What is the police doing?

2010
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,040
A bank is being robbed and my
son is held as a hostage too

2011
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,120
Make sure that he doesn't get hurt

2012
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:47,960
Okay, sir

2013
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,160
Get in!

2014
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,800
What did I ask you to do
and what have you done?

2015
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:53,160
I saw it coming!

2016
01:31:53,200 --> 01:31:55,520
I told you, don't trust this guy.
You shouldn't have taken him along

2017
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,000
- Please forgive me
- He is a rebel

2018
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:59,920
I thought you would ask for more
ransom but you screwed up everything

2019
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:02,960
I'm sure we can save all the
farmers if you cooperate with me

2020
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,400
I will meet them again and
clarify that money is our demand

2021
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,600
- Sir, please don't do that
- Hey, leave him

2022
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:11,480
- Please save the farmers, sir
- Hey, take him away from me

2023
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:15,400
Please don't give us up. Please
save the farmers from dying

2024
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:18,960
Please! I am begging you! Save the farmers!

2025
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:35,080
Hey hero, that was awesome

2026
01:32:35,160 --> 01:32:37,640
What's all this?
The public seem to enjoy this

2027
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:38,400
Hail our heroes!

2028
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,840
That was an awesome demand!

2029
01:32:40,880 --> 01:32:45,040
Awesome demand! You
guys are the rockstars!

2030
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,080
You rock! You rock!

2031
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,440
- Superb!
- Awesome!

2032
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:59,440
If they had wavered the loans earlier,
my father would have been alive today

2033
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:03,480
Oh God!

2034
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:07,920
Look, what debt has done to you.
You left your family to struggle!

2035
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,320
Told you forget about agriculture and
farming. Why didn't pay heed to my words?

2036
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,960
Dear lord, if they do waiver the
loans, it would be very helpful for us

2037
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:41,200
You will live long my dear

2038
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,400
'Waive off farmer loan '

2039
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,440
Look here!

2040
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:53,000
This particular demand
cannot be met at all

2041
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:55,080
The ransom you asked earlier is on its way

2042
01:33:55,160 --> 01:33:57,480
Take the ransom amount
and get away from here

2043
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:06,480
I give you two hours

2044
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:10,240
Waive off all the farmers' loan

2045
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:11,760
Or else the bomb will go off!

2046
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:16,320
What did you do to convince him?

2047
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,120
Waiving them off is not so easy

2048
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:19,080
Really?

2049
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,200
If the government can waive off a whopping
36K billion of the corporate loans

2050
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,160
In comparison the farmers'
loan is only 12K billion

2051
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,800
Can't waive off that?

2052
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:31,480
Each year, the government
spends a lot on our army

2053
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,680
Why can’t we do the same
for agriculture too?

2054
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,520
Both do the job of saving lives

2055
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:38,120
Only if agriculture flourishes,
the nation will flourish

2056
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:39,680
No matter which country it is

2057
01:34:40,360 --> 01:34:41,920
What are you looking at?

2058
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:43,320
The demand should be met

2059
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,560
Can you translate the
same in English?

2060
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,920
I will give 2 hours time

2061
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,720
Ban farmers' loan

2062
01:34:51,040 --> 01:34:52,080
or else bomb blast

2063
01:34:52,120 --> 01:34:53,560
Sir, can you tell it in Hindi

2064
01:34:53,640 --> 01:34:56,040
She couldn't understand
Tamil, so I spoke in English

2065
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:57,840
Now you want me to
speak in Hindi too

2066
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:00,360
Speaking a language should be
a pleasure not forced upon

2067
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,760
- Got it?
- Sorry sir

2068
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,480
Waive off! Waive off!

2069
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:05,800
Waive off! Waive off!

2070
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:07,520
Waive off farmers' loan!

2071
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,640
Waive off farmers' loan!

2072
01:35:09,720 --> 01:35:11,600
There goes my dream
of becoming a hero

2073
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:13,600
Is he mad, he has
changed the plan

2074
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,680
- Brother, you rock
- That was awesome!

2075
01:35:16,720 --> 01:35:18,600
Sir, see the support?
We call it 'Mass!'

2076
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:20,560
I'll skin you alive if
I lay my hands on you

2077
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:28,600
Robbers who demanded 200
million as ransom...

2078
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,240
are now demanding the waiving off
the farmers loan from the state

2079
01:35:32,720 --> 01:35:35,920
Robbers who demanded 200
million as ransom...

2080
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:39,960
are now demanding the waiving off
the farmers loan from the state

2081
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:43,040
The incident has shocked
the people of the state

2082
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:47,400
Do you think the demands of
the youngsters could be met?

2083
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,640
An act of rebel is how I see it

2084
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:51,160
Why would you join him
and screw it up further?

2085
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:53,160
Neither will they give us the money

2086
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,120
nor will they waive off
the farmers' loans

2087
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:56,920
If you decide to fight for the people...

2088
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,240
they will shoot you down
and name you a rebel

2089
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,360
And he wants to do

2090
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:02,680
- Will they do it?
- Yes they will

2091
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:04,920
But I know what's your idea?

2092
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:05,480
What?

2093
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:08,160
Aren't you planning to try
your hand at politics?

2094
01:36:08,200 --> 01:36:10,040
You will go out and
blame the system

2095
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,120
Am I right?

2096
01:36:11,440 --> 01:36:14,920
Forget it, every convict will
have an opportunity to redeem

2097
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,240
This is one such occasion

2098
01:36:16,280 --> 01:36:18,520
Who will blame the system then?

2099
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,240
Be careful. Don't let anybody
burn your hair during the rebel!

2100
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:22,520
They'll cut my hair?

2101
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:27,840
Hey, they got the minister's son man!

2102
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,400
Things are going to run smoothly now

2103
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,640
The boys have rocked

2104
01:36:30,680 --> 01:36:31,720
Hey, look at this

2105
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,360
Isn't it nice?

2106
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,920
This is not their fight, it is ours

2107
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,880
They have underestimated the youth

2108
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:40,320
Divert all the vans to the bank

2109
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:42,920
Call our boys, we will join the troop too

2110
01:36:47,640 --> 01:36:49,280
They are taking things very lightly

2111
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,560
It is impossible to
waive off farmers' loan

2112
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:54,480
The government will not abide
even if they give their best shot

2113
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:57,360
The people are not like earlier.
They are quite smart

2114
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:58,960
Is this the way to fight?

2115
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,240
They have held minister's son as hostage.

2116
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,760
Do you know what you are speaking?

2117
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:05,800
They protested in a silent way but
their voices fell on deaf ears

2118
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,640
That's why they took
things into their hands!

2119
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,880
It will never happen,
no matter what

2120
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:10,920
Idiots!

2121
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:12,120
Wait a minute...

2122
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,320
Why are you talking in their favor?

2123
01:37:14,360 --> 01:37:15,360
Are you on their side?

2124
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,480
I was just suggesting sir

2125
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:18,640
Suggestion is it?

2126
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,640
Let me get hold of them

2127
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,800
Why are you upset?

2128
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:26,480
What happened?

2129
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:29,000
I would have committed suicide

2130
01:37:29,680 --> 01:37:32,160
You promised me a life and
this was all about it, right?

2131
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,320
Then why did you say
refuse the money?

2132
01:37:34,360 --> 01:37:36,040
Did you think about my family?

2133
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:38,400
Did you think about me at least?

2134
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:40,920
I understand both of yours problems

2135
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:44,200
(TV News)

2136
01:37:44,280 --> 01:37:46,200
Look how people are
uniting for this cause

2137
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,240
They should definitely
cancel the farmers' loan

2138
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:49,560
Farmers loan should be canceled

2139
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,560
They should cancel the
loans of every farmer

2140
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:53,560
The government better
cancel the farmers' loans

2141
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,680
Don't you think about the food you eat?

2142
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:57,120
Agriculture is the backbone of the country

2143
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,720
Their fight is right. They should
cancel the farmers' loans

2144
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,960
Please ban

2145
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:04,120
We cannot listen to everybody and take
decision, the economy will collapse

2146
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,240
The farmers' loan should
definitely be canceled

2147
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:08,120
Please cancel the farmers' loans

2148
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:13,520
We are nothing without farmers

2149
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,040
Their welfare is our welfare

2150
01:38:17,320 --> 01:38:18,960
Remember the protest at Marina?

2151
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:20,120
Why do you think it happened?

2152
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:21,320
It's all about emotions

2153
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,360
Money was the ultimatum for me

2154
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:26,800
 but even I changed

2155
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:29,880
If you still think money
is important to you

2156
01:38:30,920 --> 01:38:33,000
Take the bag over there
and leave the place

2157
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:38,240
Forget it

2158
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,880
It would be more respectful if I died
for the farmers, rather than my family

2159
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:43,560
- What do you say?
- True

2160
01:38:44,040 --> 01:38:45,000
Hey, hero

2161
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:47,640
You are not the reel hero
anymore, you are a real hero

2162
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,480
Why is he destroying
those buttons?

2163
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,400
What is he looking for? Wait!

2164
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:57,240
What are you doing here?

2165
01:38:57,960 --> 01:38:58,880
Aiy-aiyo!

2166
01:38:59,560 --> 01:39:00,440
Whoa!

2167
01:39:04,640 --> 01:39:06,200
Malayalam art?

2168
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:10,400
You're here to rob instead look what
kind of movie are you watching?

2169
01:39:10,440 --> 01:39:13,000
Look at those brothers having fun.
Stop it!

2170
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:15,160
That's the same guy from
that movie. Go grab him!

2171
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:18,520
Kong, why don't you get better ideas
from the Hollywood movies I showed you?

2172
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:19,600
Go and grab him instead

2173
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:21,680
I said, leave me!

2174
01:39:23,720 --> 01:39:24,840
Lusty gorilla!

2175
01:39:29,480 --> 01:39:30,520
Yes, sir!

2176
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:31,320
Yes, sir!

2177
01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:33,720
I will take care sir!

2178
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:37,120
The commissioner is sitting calm in his
AC room and making my life a hell!

2179
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:40,400
He wants me to save the hostages
quickly but no one must be hurt

2180
01:39:40,480 --> 01:39:43,720
And on top of that he wants us to show
extra care on that minister's son

2181
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,960
Hey, who is that distributing
water bottles around?

2182
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,880
Distributing biscuit packets too.
Who's that ?

2183
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:54,000
Sir, someone named "People's
Superstar" it seems

2184
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:57,520
"People's superstar?" No one understands
the difficulty of police officers

2185
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,480
These guys are a pain in the head!

2186
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:01,000
Even Kamal Haasan...

2187
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:04,800
Yeah, I know that he is a great actor.
He has also started a party of late

2188
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:07,800
He has tweeted 5 long pages
of message in support of them

2189
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:11,480
We have lost the count of
political parties now

2190
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:14,200
It would take decades to decode his
single tweet and now five pages?

2191
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:16,400
How did you finish this level?

2192
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,800
How did you cross so many levels?

2193
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,600
What a horrible scene to watch?

2194
01:40:25,320 --> 01:40:27,880
You wanted to die few days back

2195
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:29,280
What's so funny now?

2196
01:40:29,320 --> 01:40:32,920
At least, I was hoping to
die before I came here

2197
01:40:32,960 --> 01:40:34,840
you on the other hand planned
for a luxurious life after this

2198
01:40:34,880 --> 01:40:38,880
It's so funny that you guys are
also going to die along with me

2199
01:40:39,240 --> 01:40:42,440
Don't you still keep trying to be a hero
on the other side after death. Got it?

2200
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:48,480
Hello!

2201
01:40:48,520 --> 01:40:50,320
Hey Venkat, where are you?

2202
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:51,960
Why do you care? Just
tell me what is it?

2203
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,720
One of the bombs that I gave
you is actually a real one

2204
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:55,480
The timer on that one works fine.
Don't set it on

2205
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:56,520
What do you mean?

2206
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:58,520
If it goes off, it will kill
everybody along with the bomber

2207
01:40:58,560 --> 01:40:59,640
Listen! Hello!

2208
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:00,680
Hello!

2209
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:01,880
Hey Venkat!

2210
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:02,880
Damn!

2211
01:41:05,280 --> 01:41:07,120
Dude,a situation has come up!

2212
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:07,760
Tell me

2213
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,880
Remember how Sathish always
wants to commit suicide?

2214
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,320
He is going to die for real now!

2215
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:12,720
- Let him die!
- Dude!!!

2216
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:14,920
The Bomb guy just called

2217
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,480
One of the four bombs
he gave is original

2218
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,200
Stop kidding!

2219
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,720
No, I swear! He called just
now to inform me that!

2220
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:26,640
Maybe that's the reason behind the
beep sound that comes from his bomb

2221
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:29,720
Hey! What is the secret that
you are trying to hide?

2222
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,640
- You tell him!
- No, you tell him!

2223
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,240
Please let him know!

2224
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,760
Somebody say it

2225
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:36,200
Dude!

2226
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:39,160
Promise me you won't
panic, if I say something

2227
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,400
I won't. Tell me

2228
01:41:44,080 --> 01:41:45,560
The bomb that you are
wearing...

2229
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,920
 is an original one

2230
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:54,520
You are jealous because the
timer is working in only mine

2231
01:41:55,800 --> 01:41:57,080
Dude! Please explain to him!

2232
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:00,320
Dude, he is telling the truth! Whatever
he said about the bomb is true

2233
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,280
The bomb is what makes
the timer to work!

2234
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,680
The bomb guy has misplaced one

2235
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,520
You are telling as though he
has flipped coffee for tea!

2236
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,040
Forget him! Why did you turn
it on in the first place!

2237
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:11,960
It was not me! It was that ape
who plays with red buttons!

2238
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:15,760
Kong?

2239
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:16,920
Dude, what shall we do?

2240
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,680
Wait! let us think about it!

2241
01:42:18,720 --> 01:42:20,760
About what, my funeral isn't it?

2242
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:23,120
Promise me that you will do as I say

2243
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:23,760
I promise!

2244
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:26,480
Please, don't reveal
this matter to Sadhik

2245
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,440
Sadhik!

2246
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:29,000
Why is he going towards Sadhik?

2247
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:31,960
Hey! How are you?

2248
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
This bomb suit doesn't fit my size

2249
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:36,920
They made a mistake it seems.
Is it okay if we swap these!

2250
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:39,040
Get Lost!

2251
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:41,280
I think this design will suit you!

2252
01:42:41,320 --> 01:42:42,480
I asked you to get lost!

2253
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:45,280
He is coming back here

2254
01:42:45,360 --> 01:42:47,120
Why is he not
accepting to swap the suit?

2255
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:48,240
- Damn it!
- Dude...

2256
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,400
It was all your mistake!

2257
01:42:49,440 --> 01:42:51,440
Doesn't matter! The bomb blast
will kill you and the people!

2258
01:42:51,480 --> 01:42:53,400
Are you fixing the time for the blast?

2259
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,760
Help me please, I won't
be able to bear the heat

2260
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:56,720
Damn it!

2261
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,400
- A bomb blast?
- Yes man

2262
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,640
Who is this joker?

2263
01:42:59,680 --> 01:43:01,560
I feel bomb blast will be
better that his torture

2264
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,240
I am really scared,
please help me!

2265
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,080
Sir...

2266
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,880
- Listen to us! Control yourselves!
- No, you aren't allowed there

2267
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,960
Listen to us!
Please stay where you are!

2268
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:26,480
Here, take it

2269
01:43:26,520 --> 01:43:27,640
Then you take it

2270
01:43:27,680 --> 01:43:29,920
Didn't I promised to
fulfill what you asked for?

2271
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,120
You guys are doing grieve
mistake over and again

2272
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:34,120
Don't behave like kids

2273
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:37,760
I said, we'll fulfill your needs!

2274
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:43,520
You guys don't get the seriousness

2275
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:44,760
Which is why I got this

2276
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:47,280
This bomb will set off and blast
after one and half hours

2277
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:50,280
There are three such bombs inside

2278
01:43:50,640 --> 01:43:53,320
Once it blasts, the whole
area will turn into ashes

2279
01:43:55,640 --> 01:43:58,080
If the farmer's loan aren't
canceled at once...

2280
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:00,240
the whole area will burn down to ashes!

2281
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,000
Listen! Excuse me!

2282
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:28,840
Long live our future
Chief minister!

2283
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,640
Long live our future
chief minister!

2284
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,280
Back! Step back!

2285
01:44:33,320 --> 01:44:35,600
- Get down!
- Control the crowd!

2286
01:44:35,640 --> 01:44:39,840
Talking about the bank heist, the people are
in full support for the robbers' demands

2287
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,640
Facebook, Twitter etc., support
is pouring is from all over

2288
01:44:42,680 --> 01:44:46,080
It has now become people's protest. No
big shot can do anything about it now

2289
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:48,760
So, now that you saw the
tweets in twitter...

2290
01:44:48,840 --> 01:44:52,840
The tweets are also in support
to cancel the farmer's loan

2291
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,360
- I hope at least you understand now
- Please, switch it off

2292
01:44:55,400 --> 01:44:58,600
This channel is making the wrong
use of media to prove wrong points

2293
01:44:58,680 --> 01:45:00,560
More than talking about the youths...

2294
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:03,720
what we must focus
is on their demands!

2295
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:08,040
Hey Kong! Come on, nothing to worry.
Nothing to worry

2296
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:10,680
- Awesome buddy
- Thanks dude

2297
01:45:10,760 --> 01:45:12,920
- Why are you crying?
- Look, he became emotional!

2298
01:45:13,520 --> 01:45:15,920
- Come on, won't I even do this for you
- Crying doesn't suit you

2299
01:45:15,960 --> 01:45:18,120
- What's wrong with him?
- Don't tease me too much

2300
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,080
Had the bomb set off,
even you would've died

2301
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:22,760
Fine! Shut up!

2302
01:45:25,360 --> 01:45:26,720
What kind of explosives?

2303
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,960
It's a very rare material, sir

2304
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,080
That bomb is a plastic
explosive type

2305
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:32,000
Had it set off, the aftermath
would've been very bad

2306
01:45:32,040 --> 01:45:36,000
If those three bombs inside set off then
then the after math will be even worse

2307
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,640
Chief, already people
are abusing our party

2308
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:41,200
On top of that they are torturing us by
staging protests one after the other

2309
01:45:41,240 --> 01:45:46,120
Indeed chief, before opposite party takes
advantage of this issue before election...

2310
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:48,240
let's take advantage of it
and it'll be very useful

2311
01:45:48,280 --> 01:45:48,960
Point!

2312
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:50,840
- Secretary
- Sir

2313
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:53,720
There might be 1000s of complications
in solving the farmer's loan crisis

2314
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:54,240
Yes sir

2315
01:45:54,280 --> 01:45:55,600
But can we solve it
according to the law?

2316
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:58,560
Chief, it's would be embarrassing
if we budge to some four silly guys

2317
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:00,200
Then everyone will
start doing the same

2318
01:46:00,240 --> 01:46:01,040
Silence!

2319
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:02,440
You carry on

2320
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,720
Order us and it'll be done

2321
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,560
Then bank won't cancel the loan

2322
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,560
Instead we can announce that
the government will pay it

2323
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:08,440
Look here...

2324
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:10,040
The next election is in three months

2325
01:46:10,080 --> 01:46:14,040
We won the previous election only when we
promised to cancel farmers loans but we didn't

2326
01:46:14,440 --> 01:46:18,720
All the loans can be paid off if we all stop
accepting bribes for the next three months

2327
01:46:18,800 --> 01:46:20,360
- What do you all say?
- Awesome chief!

2328
01:46:20,440 --> 01:46:21,680
Chief, I would like to say that...

2329
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,320
Please continue eating the mixture

2330
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,240
Tell me

2331
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:26,400
Mr Chief minister!

2332
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:28,800
What games are you guys playing?

2333
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,160
The bank is being robbed...

2334
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:31,720
...and they even
abducted my son

2335
01:46:31,800 --> 01:46:33,280
Do you even care about it?

2336
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:34,520
Please be patient

2337
01:46:34,560 --> 01:46:35,880
Soon we'll arrive
at a good decision

2338
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:38,480
I don't care about your decision
but for me my son matters!

2339
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:42,920
The chief minister will address
the press media shortly

2340
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,440
Greetings

2341
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:47,320
We request people not to indulge
in any kind of violent activities

2342
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:50,400
This government is for the people and
will always work for people's welfare

2343
01:46:50,440 --> 01:46:53,480
Well, we agree there has been a
delay in the farmers' loan issue

2344
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,960
To those guys who reminded
us about it on time...

2345
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,800
we convey our heartfelt thanks

2346
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:00,760
All the farmers, loan are
canceled from this moment

2347
01:47:07,720 --> 01:47:10,480
Tamil Nadu government
cancels farmers loan

2348
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,880
People celebrate the youths
for placing this demand

2349
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:17,000
Farmers all over Tamil Nadu
celebrates with firecrackers

2350
01:47:27,440 --> 01:47:31,000
The government has announced that
it will cancel the farmers' loan

2351
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:34,160
Didn't expect that these
jokers will turn it around!

2352
01:47:58,520 --> 01:48:00,000
What are you guys doing?

2353
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:02,240
They have tortured us one whole day!

2354
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:04,080
We must not spare them so easy!

2355
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:06,040
Once we retrieve the
hostages safely...

2356
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,880
We shall takes these guys in and...

2357
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,720
Encounter them somewhere
in the outskirts

2358
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:14,600
Only then the people
will stop protesting

2359
01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:16,600
Ok, go ahead.
Shoot them!

2360
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:17,560
Yes sir!

2361
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:19,000
Will the robbers get caught?

2362
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:22,720
More forces pour in as the police strengthen
their forces under the leadership of AC

2363
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,120
They are surrounded by police.
Do you think they can escape?

2364
01:48:25,160 --> 01:48:26,640
I'll be happy if those youth escape

2365
01:48:26,680 --> 01:48:29,680
If anything happens to any of those
guy then we must not keep quiet!

2366
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:31,080
We are in danger from this moment

2367
01:48:31,120 --> 01:48:32,960
We are in danger ever
since you joined us

2368
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,760
Dude, they'll finish us for sure

2369
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,000
Only if we surrender

2370
01:48:36,040 --> 01:48:36,920
What?

2371
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:44,120
Nothing very complex
I'm sure he's gotta simple idea

2372
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,520
Friends, everyone of you
cooperated really well

2373
01:48:57,560 --> 01:48:58,760
Thanks for your cooperation

2374
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:01,640
Get up, everyone.
Thank you

2375
01:49:03,320 --> 01:49:04,320
Great escape

2376
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:06,000
- We can't escape
- Why?

2377
01:49:06,040 --> 01:49:07,480
The police has
surrounded the place

2378
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:08,360
We are done for!

2379
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,920
- Stop saying the same thing again and again
- There are many of them!

2380
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:12,280
Listen, make them
all stand in a queue

2381
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,480
You, where is that Parda?

2382
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:15,640
Wait, I'll get it

2383
01:49:15,680 --> 01:49:18,680
- Quick! Stand in a queue
- Form a queue. Make it fast

2384
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,840
Be quiet and stand in a line

2385
01:49:19,880 --> 01:49:22,800
- Remember, you don't know about the minister.
You're doing a blunder

2386
01:49:22,840 --> 01:49:23,760
- Shut up and move!

2387
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:24,760
Come on, Jhansi

2388
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,400
- Catch it
- I said move! Move!

2389
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:27,800
Go and stand in
front of the queue

2390
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:29,280
Your demands have been met

2391
01:49:29,320 --> 01:49:31,440
Release the hostages at once!

2392
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,640
Excuse me, get me that blower

2393
01:49:34,040 --> 01:49:35,160
What are you up to?

2394
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:36,640
Get the queue ready

2395
01:49:36,680 --> 01:49:38,480
- Here
- Give it to me. Go

2396
01:49:39,560 --> 01:49:41,880
What are you doing?
Give me two wads of cash

2397
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:42,720
Here you go

2398
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:44,000
- Keep it inside
- Give it to me

2399
01:49:44,040 --> 01:49:44,880
Kong! Come here

2400
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:45,720
Come on, Kong

2401
01:49:45,760 --> 01:49:47,040
Take this bag and go upstairs

2402
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,680
Why are you making me wear a Parda?

2403
01:49:48,720 --> 01:49:49,880
You face is disgusting!
Cover it!

2404
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:50,560
Move! Move!

2405
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:51,920
- Jhansi
- Come here

2406
01:49:59,920 --> 01:50:01,720
Tell me, sir

2407
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:05,480
Sir, as per your orders I have arranged a
separate vehicle to escort the accused guys

2408
01:50:05,520 --> 01:50:06,920
Ensure the path way is cleared up

2409
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,880
- Are the vehicles ready?
- Yes sir. Sure

2410
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:15,640
Dude!

2411
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:16,800
- Ready?
- Yes, dude!

2412
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:25,280
Look! A monkey!

2413
01:50:25,320 --> 01:50:26,920
Look! The monkey has a gun!

2414
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:28,840
It's their weapon that
monkey is now having

2415
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:31,200
"Watch out, we are coming for you"

2416
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:33,880
"You, won't even know who we are
why hit you"

2417
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:43,000
"Lock, cover your money inside
Run along, won't let you hide"

2418
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:45,240
Sir, it's carrying money
in the other hand

2419
01:51:06,040 --> 01:51:07,960
- Come on! Come on!
- Let's collect the money

2420
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:09,360
Officers stop them

2421
01:51:09,440 --> 01:51:11,720
Stop them! Guards!

2422
01:51:11,960 --> 01:51:13,200
Stop everyone!

2423
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:15,720
Sir, this is uncontrollable

2424
01:51:16,360 --> 01:51:18,200
Hey! Stop them all!

2425
01:51:26,920 --> 01:51:29,400
Sir! Sir, people are
coming out of the bank!

2426
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,400
Move!

2427
01:51:53,920 --> 01:51:56,000
- It's me! The minister's son
- Put him in the jeep

2428
01:51:56,040 --> 01:51:58,120
- I'm minister's son, sir
- Put him in the jeep! Now!

2429
01:51:58,240 --> 01:51:58,960
Be careful

2430
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,480
Daddy! Couldn't you have
drilled a bigger hole?

2431
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:04,480
Aiyo! Jormungand!

2432
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:06,280
- Who are you?
- Sorry. I got the wrong route

2433
01:52:06,320 --> 01:52:08,440
- Forgive me. Son, back!
- No, you are on the right route

2434
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:09,360
Ok daddy

2435
01:52:09,400 --> 01:52:11,760
- Let's drill under the next room
- Buddy! Dude!

2436
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:15,080
Dude, come here! Look, a stranger
has dug a tunnel for us to escape

2437
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:16,920
Remove all that crap and come on!

2438
01:52:16,960 --> 01:52:18,840
Make it fast!
Make it fast!

2439
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,720
Why is he walking as if he is
out on the beach for a walk?

2440
01:52:22,760 --> 01:52:24,360
Where are you going?
Come with us

2441
01:52:24,400 --> 01:52:25,840
 I'll get stuck if I
enter that tunnel

2442
01:52:25,880 --> 01:52:27,320
I'll escape claiming
to be an undercover cop

2443
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,960
Yes. Only a subway
will suit him

2444
01:52:29,080 --> 01:52:30,800
- Quick! Come on!
- Get down! Move!

2445
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,640
You came last when we entered
but you want to escape first?

2446
01:52:32,680 --> 01:52:34,720
Dare you turn up again
at our doorstep!

2447
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:37,320
Everyone's gone

2448
01:52:37,360 --> 01:52:39,680
Time to get mixed up in
the crowd and escape

2449
01:52:40,680 --> 01:52:43,040
"Watch out, we are coming for you"

2450
01:52:43,080 --> 01:52:46,040
"You, won't even know who we are
why hit you"

2451
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:47,560
Search!

2452
01:52:47,800 --> 01:52:48,880
Move!

2453
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:55,680
Hey look! A bomb!

2454
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,040
Run! Quick!

2455
01:52:58,640 --> 01:53:02,120
Pick how much ever you want but dare
you lay hands on my collection!

2456
01:53:04,720 --> 01:53:06,000
- You!
- Yes sir?

2457
01:53:06,040 --> 01:53:08,600
- Give the money that you took
- I grabbed all this with great difficulty

2458
01:53:08,640 --> 01:53:10,600
- You grab some if you want
- Come to the police station!

2459
01:53:10,640 --> 01:53:13,400
When so many are grabbing money
all over why arrest me alone?

2460
01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:44,800
- Get in! Quick!
- Start! Drive!

2461
01:53:46,760 --> 01:53:49,240
"Watch out, we are coming for you"

2462
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:52,280
"You, won't even know who we are
why hit you"

2463
01:53:53,280 --> 01:53:54,800
Whoa! Money!

2464
01:53:55,640 --> 01:53:57,600
- My dear son!
- Yes daddy!

2465
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,280
One door closed but look
another one has opened!

2466
01:53:59,320 --> 01:54:00,200
- Wow!
- Come on!

2467
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:03,560
Quick! Let's collect it and settle down
before they declare the currencies invalid!

2468
01:54:05,600 --> 01:54:07,560
- Can your foot reach the accelerator?
- Shut up!

2469
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:08,920
Help her with the gears, please

2470
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:11,000
I don't see anybody following us!
Drive faster anyway

2471
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,360
Let's clear the place
as soon as possible

2472
01:54:12,400 --> 01:54:13,560
Hey! Where is Kong?

2473
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:14,160
Kong?

2474
01:54:14,200 --> 01:54:15,560
Yes, where is he?

2475
01:54:15,600 --> 01:54:17,520
Is he stuck there?

2476
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:19,280
Let's go back and look for him

2477
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:22,600
Don't listen to them! The cops
recognizes us now, its risky to go back

2478
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:24,320
They will shoot us
down if they catch us

2479
01:54:24,360 --> 01:54:27,760
- No, turn around the car
- If you want to save him, go alone

2480
01:54:28,720 --> 01:54:31,040
Look out! There is a
police car approaching!!!

2481
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,680
That's it!!

2482
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:36,160
You predicted we will be free for two
days, we didn't even last two minutes

2483
01:54:42,680 --> 01:54:44,800
Hey!! Its Kong in the car!

2484
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:49,520
Kong!!

2485
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,280
Look there is some bag inside

2486
01:54:56,680 --> 01:54:58,840
Its pretty heavy

2487
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,520
The bag seems to be
filled with money

2488
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:17,160
This is the 200 million
ransom amount we asked for!

2489
01:55:17,200 --> 01:55:20,000
Yes, it is! Lets spend this before
they declare it to be invalid!

2490
01:55:21,680 --> 01:55:24,920
- Sir, Let go off my face! Its paining sir!
- Hey! Remove the mask!

2491
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:26,840
That's not mask,
that's my face sir!

2492
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:28,520
 Let go off me, sir! Arrgh!

2493
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,200
It is his original face after all!!

2494
01:55:31,240 --> 01:55:31,960
Thanks man

2495
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,480
He has fixed the gorilla's face
on to his through surgery!

2496
01:55:34,520 --> 01:55:35,960
He is human for sure!

2497
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:37,040
Sir

2498
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:40,320
The movie is over then
what are you looking at?

2499
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,640
You are caught red handed
with all evidences

2500
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,640
Tell me where are they?
Do not lie to me!

2501
01:55:49,320 --> 01:55:50,760
Yes, like that! Shut it!

2502
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:54,320
How about a story, sir?
