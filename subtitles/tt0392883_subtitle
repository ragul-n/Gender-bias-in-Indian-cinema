1
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,658
Cooperate and no one will get hurt!

2
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,936
Unload Yaks, Jampa

3
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,580
Hang out all you have!

4
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,138
l've nothing.

5
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,659
l'm just a singer.

6
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,456
Then sing.

7
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,055
Thank you.

8
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,289
For times to come.

9
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,450
Hey you!

10
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,455
Get lost!

11
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,609
Vanish!

12
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,696
Get lost!

13
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,975
Are you deaf?.

14
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,420
Disappear!

15
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,058
Catch up with your people.

16
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,099
Will you grow roots here or what?

17
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,329
Hey chilli! Become air!

18
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,292
You are the one
l have seen in my dreams.

19
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,657
Take me with you.

20
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,650
Jampa.

21
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,655
Why take her along? Jalan!

22
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,055
He's lost his mind!

23
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,299
Hey, come on!

24
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,015
Hey Chilli!

25
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,654
Hey, look at her!

26
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,532
Drink this,
the pain will go away by dawn.

27
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,215
Standby everybody.

28
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,649
Standby.

29
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,730
Easy.

30
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,970
What was that?

31
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,334
Don't know.

32
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:54,890
Come in.

33
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,736
Closer.

34
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,058
That's too dangerous.
They will trace the origin of the goods.

35
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,931
They won't dare to ...

36
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,851
Like always,

37
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,931
it is too risky to change now.

38
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,897
lnstead, return to our land.

39
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,935
Live happily!

40
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,214
Let's get married!

41
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,408
Who wants to return?

42
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,214
You think those rich land-lords
will let you live in peace?

43
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,490
Then go.

44
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,889
Don't let your present success
erase the memory

45
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,975
of why we left in the first place.

46
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,738
We were outcast
long before we became outlaws.

47
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,172
The path we walk...

48
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,178
knows no peace.

49
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,139
Don't ever forget that.

50
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,336
Jampa-la.

51
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,134
Arrange to meet merchants.
Same spot, ten sacs of gold.

52
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,936
That many?

53
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,135
Booty's up on us ...

54
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,336
lbex-eye!

55
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,892
- She's wearing our clothes.
- Shameless.

56
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,298
Hey chilly, come here!

57
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,616
What's this?

58
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,329
Ration for seven days.

59
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,609
Are you chasing me away?

60
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,410
l'm sending you away.

61
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,811
Your people won't have reached far.

62
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,695
They're not my people.

63
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,578
l'm here to stay with you.

64
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,177
That's not possible, your Highness.

65
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,931
l can also do what you men can do.

66
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,136
Can you piss standing?

67
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,538
l can be of use to you.

68
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,292
Of course you were useful to him.

69
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,969
How about me?

70
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,700
Hey! Girls like you are valleys:
low, and easy.

71
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,736
Who knows how many caravans
have passed through ...

72
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,294
You know that prior to last night...

73
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,455
l was a virgin.

74
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,493
Pity.

75
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,130
Stop!

76
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,935
Let her go, Jalan.

77
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,496
Wait.

78
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:33,891
What now?

79
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,052
l wanted to call you but ...

80
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,453
- You didn't know my name?
- Yes.

81
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,093
- Ushna?
- Ushna.

82
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,860
Ushna, meaning fire.

83
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:48,895
You live up to your name.

84
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,735
- l'm ''the flame''.
- l know.

85
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,568
Really?

86
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,940
Do you burn?

87
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,454
Slowly ... Not like you ...

88
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,412
- They are laughing.
- Shut up. You're jealous.

89
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,016
How many?

90
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:32,735
300 horses.

91
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,251
Oh dear one,

92
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,696
least you can do,

93
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,496
is love somebody,

94
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,697
someday, somewhere

95
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:11,780
is love somebody,

96
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,056
someday, somewhere

97
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,530
is love somebody,

98
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,410
What are you staring at?

99
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,694
The way l eat?

100
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,611
Where do l come from?
Where's my home?

101
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,816
A woman like you should be at home.

102
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,300
Find someone, marry him ...

103
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,531
You don't know anything, do you?

104
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,539
Watch your tongue, lady.

105
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,899
Of what help are you to us?

106
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,780
Whatever you say ...

107
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,897
You said you can be of use to us.

108
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,052
You've been looting the silk road...

109
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,057
frequently used by traders?

110
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Yes.

111
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,653
Have you ever missed
a single caravan?

112
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,900
No.

113
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,018
But the silk
still reaches the lndian market.

114
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,219
There is one more route,

115
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,091
through deep ravines, ice-cold deserts,

116
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,616
through such high passes
which you don't know.

117
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,729
And you know it?

118
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,819
l know less but understand more.

119
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,330
lf you're wrong, you'll quit the gang.

120
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,497
Jalan, learn to live with me,

121
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:46,218
'cause l'm never wrong!

122
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,410
Crazy.

123
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,690
Jalan.

124
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,774
How long will we go on?

125
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:46,333
There is no pass that we don't know.

126
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,092
What's unknown here?

127
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,011
We can still turn around.

128
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,216
Have you ever been across
those snow-peaks?

129
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,900
No.

130
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,458
Then how do you know what's beyond?

131
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,089
- What's beyond anyway?
- lf you don't go there, how will you know!

132
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,090
We can't trust her, what if ...

133
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,573
You see, Jalan? l'm never wrong.

134
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,729
Hak-Chi!

135
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,889
Hang out more!

136
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,255
Show your hands!

137
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,258
Do you know
why is he named ''No-Smile''?

138
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,534
No, why?

139
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,939
Because he never smiles.

140
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,300
He's named ''Hak-Chi''.
Do you know why?

141
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,210
Why?

142
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,653
Twisted-hair, tell her.

143
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,820
At the time of his birth,
his mother pushed hard

144
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,050
but he refused to come out of her belly.

145
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,176
Suddenly,
his mother sneezed ''Hak-Cheeee'' ...

146
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,369
... and he popped out like a bullet

147
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,817
Oh, dear one,

148
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,858
least you can do.

149
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,290
Oh, dear one,

150
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:48,293
least you can do.

151
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:51,850
is love somebody,

152
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,373
someday, somewhere.

153
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,780
is love somebody,

154
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,419
someday, somewhere.

155
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,330
is love somebody,

156
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:10,173
someday, somewhere.

157
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,569
l didn't know
you've such a beautiful voice!

158
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,608
No. l don't.

159
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,256
That's him!

160
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,969
You may go now.

161
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,494
Yes, there was also a stranger.

162
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,460
A girl, who took a ride with us.

163
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,576
She's been missing since then.

164
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,254
What was she like?

165
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:24,494
Hard to tell,
she kept mostly to herself

166
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,692
Too pale for a mountain girl.

167
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,578
She never drank
or ate in the course of days.

168
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,054
You may leave.

169
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:07,576
No.

170
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,132
l want to look at you.

171
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,733
Strange, you don't have
the centre of the universe.

172
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,776
Centre of the universe?

173
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,097
A belly button ...

174
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,699
You don't have one.

175
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,100
From birth l don't.

176
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,218
Then, how could you be born?

177
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,250
Without it,
how did you survive in the womb?

178
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:01,697
Yeti !

179
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,615
lt's not a good omen.

180
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,694
One-tooth, have you ever seen Yeti?

181
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,214
No. But l am sure he has seen us.

182
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,655
ls he really
a giant abominable snowman?

183
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,933
he loves alcohol.

184
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,411
A rare piece!

185
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,329
lt's called ''revolver''.

186
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,659
Recently manufactured ...

187
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,369
...last year.

188
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,378
Look, it's engraved here ''1835''.

189
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,937
lt comes from England.

190
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,897
Let's go attack England!

191
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:07,891
Relly?

192
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,696
Where is this England?

193
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:10,856
There!

194
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,135
You see those snow-peaks?

195
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:19,050
Beyond those peaks is the ocean,
Then another ocean.

196
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:23,897
And then there is a little island in the
middle of the ocean - that's England.

197
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,452
l always wanted to see the ocean!

198
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,532
Three gold coins and

199
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:33,053
l can show you ocean right here.

200
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,170
Do you belive me?

201
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,779
l have seen the Ocean.

202
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,973
Yeti? Why is he after us?

203
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,250
Tashi!

204
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:50,850
Jalan!

205
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,895
Jalan!

206
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,136
No, Jalan ... lt's dangerous!

207
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,377
Clear out!

208
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,177
Trust me.
Nothing will happen to Tashi.

209
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,898
l know Yeti's ways.

210
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,812
She's right, Jalan,

211
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,652
why would Yeti hurt Tashi?

212
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,173
l know a place far away.

213
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,888
We're going nowhere.

214
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,298
That will make us really rich.

215
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:25,578
Wasn't l right last time?

216
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,890
Besides, there're phenomenal things
waiting to be robbed!

217
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,137
lt's a long arduous ride.

218
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,219
Out with the love story.

219
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,810
Tharchin!

220
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,420
Tharchin!

221
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,136
Water!

222
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,858
Water!

223
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,214
Empty!

224
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,889
Nothing lasts for ever ...

225
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,537
Where is he?

226
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,416
Where is he?

227
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,659
- Who?
- Where is he?

228
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,331
- Who, Jalan?
- l knew it!

229
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,537
Who was the man with you?

230
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,775
Which man?

231
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,250
With whom you were lying legs open!

232
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,773
We should have never camped so high.

233
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,289
Thin air is getting to you.

234
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,653
l don't know what you are seeing.

235
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,055
Maybe future.

236
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,249
You look exhausted.

237
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,609
Come to me.

238
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,378
For the first time l fear our destiny.

239
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,135
Don't distress,
l'll take you to someone special.

240
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,299
Ushna! Entering the village is risky!

241
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,575
Nothing is a risk, when we're together.

242
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,500
What you've lost in wealth,

243
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,819
you will gain in health.

244
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,772
Watch out for the pot!

245
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,335
This one?

246
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,899
No.

247
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,136
That one.

248
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,938
Your blessings, Onpo.

249
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,170
You're welcome

250
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:17,297
Never seen a face like this before.

251
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,696
Strange.

252
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,691
lt doesn't look promising.

253
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,493
You two have no future together.

254
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:36,419
- Ushna?
- And three of us?

255
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,968
l won't hurt him.

256
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:41,410
Come.

257
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:49,259
Now observe carefully and point out
those with an abundance of good luck.

258
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,818
Robbing other's luck
will not take you further.

259
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,535
Just concentrate.

260
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,454
Come with me.

261
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,496
Now.

262
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:03,410
My shadow!

263
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,254
... more Chhang.

264
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,139
We've lost them.

265
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:23,370
No, we've found them.

266
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,969
Now, all we need to know
is where they are.

267
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:35,690
What's going on?

268
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,689
Packed to leave?

269
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,377
Jampa?

270
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,096
We've camped here for many days.

271
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,900
lf we don't move before sunrise,
it could be dangerous.

272
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,094
You should have asked me.

273
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,055
Nowadays, you're never around.

274
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,490
Now, what's with him?

275
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,539
Mortal snake bite.

276
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,618
- When?
- Moments ago.

277
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,294
- What did you give?
- Some herb juice.

278
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,615
What do we know about this Ushna?

279
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,337
...who is blazing our trail?

280
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,932
Whom we follow here and there.

281
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:18,813
Without any questions.

282
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,899
Where does she come from?
Why she came?

283
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,379
Scream! Go ahead!

284
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:32,740
She has a complete spell on you.

285
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,537
Did you ever think about it?

286
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,254
Poison? Why do you give poison?

287
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,978
Only poison can exterminate poison.

288
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,376
How does she know what we don't know?

289
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,613
Yes, we should
be asking many more questions.

290
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:49,976
Jampa!

291
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,979
You should have left...

292
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,653
when l told you.

293
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,211
Why?

294
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:23,814
Because now it's impossible.

295
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,133
Leave the horses here.

296
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:47,211
Leave us also with the horses.

297
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,777
Why?

298
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:54,814
Aren't you tired of looting
material wealth?

299
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,172
We won't accompany you, Jalan.

300
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,172
Speak for yourself, Jampa.

301
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,416
Ask them.

302
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:19,770
We will wait for you here.

303
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:21,409
But don't do a favour.

304
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,490
Do wait.

305
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,495
Give us your blessing.

306
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,700
We want to offer you something.

307
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:56,770
l need nothing, please leave!

308
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:04,930
Please!

309
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,176
Now!

310
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,779
But, we need something.

311
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,769
The ocean ...

312
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:37,975
Jampa, what's up?

313
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:40,059
Did you see a demon?

314
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,889
What's going on?

315
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,860
Jalan...
Things are just not as they used to be.

316
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:17,294
We abandoned our villages, our lands,

317
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:19,291
because we were victims of injustice!

318
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,492
We were oppressed,

319
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:24,931
out dignity was destroyed.

320
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,890
Thus, we vowed to live differently,
honorably.

321
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,572
Keeping our heads high.

322
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,379
All these years we've been together,

323
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:34,940
wandering the Himalayas ...

324
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,658
That's enough!

325
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,576
What ''enough''?

326
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:41,809
For how long?

327
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,136
Jalan!

328
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,374
Whatever destiny gave us

329
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,809
we shared everything,

330
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:56,653
equally among ourselves.

331
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,172
Joy, sorrow,

332
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:03,692
daily bread, drink, loot.

333
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:05,179
We shared everything.

334
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,931
Now it's like every man for himself.

335
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,333
You've changed, Jalan.

336
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,170
l have changed?

337
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,818
lf not, you'd have shared

338
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,576
everything precious to you.

339
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,252
What haven't l shared with you?

340
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:20,056
Ushna.

341
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,130
Who are you?

342
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,893
l can't even recognize you!

343
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,057
How did we come to this?

344
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,769
Stop, Hakchi!

345
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:10,096
For what?

346
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,572
Our village is far ...

347
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:15,809
and the ride is pathetic.

348
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,337
What can be more pathetic than this?

349
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,650
l'll wait for you here.

350
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,096
Don't wait.

351
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:39,533
We're not coming back.

352
00:58:08,053 --> 00:58:09,486
We lost her again.

353
00:58:10,293 --> 00:58:13,285
ls it real?

354
00:58:17,213 --> 00:58:20,523
Reality is caused
by alcoholic deficiency.

355
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:25,692
So let's have a drink ...

356
00:58:43,893 --> 00:58:44,689
Did you hear anything?

357
00:58:45,053 --> 00:58:45,644
No, why?

358
00:58:52,933 --> 00:58:53,888
What happened?

359
00:58:55,453 --> 00:58:56,329
Nothing.

360
00:58:57,573 --> 00:58:58,483
Nothing.

361
00:59:13,853 --> 00:59:14,842
Where is Jalan?

362
00:59:16,933 --> 00:59:23,168
Your form of sensual beauty
is not enough to make Jalan yours.

363
00:59:23,253 --> 00:59:24,606
Where is Jalan?

364
00:59:25,333 --> 00:59:27,164
He is where he should be,

365
00:59:28,373 --> 00:59:30,841
and you should go back

366
00:59:32,213 --> 00:59:34,966
where you came from.

367
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:36,807
Never.

368
00:59:36,893 --> 00:59:39,123
There is no future in your union.

369
00:59:40,773 --> 00:59:41,762
He belongs to me.

370
00:59:45,173 --> 00:59:46,003
And you?

371
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,402
Whom do you belong to?

372
00:59:51,373 --> 00:59:52,852
l love him.

373
00:59:59,213 --> 01:00:00,692
Enough, where's Jalan?

374
01:00:00,773 --> 01:00:03,606
You should collaborate and return.

375
01:00:06,933 --> 01:00:08,491
That's what l should do,

376
01:00:09,373 --> 01:00:10,203
Yeti. But ...

377
01:00:11,173 --> 01:00:12,731
then l never do

378
01:00:13,733 --> 01:00:15,052
what l should do.

379
01:01:26,053 --> 01:01:27,327
Lucky bastard.

380
01:01:30,973 --> 01:01:32,725
Hey! His horse!

381
01:01:32,813 --> 01:01:34,132
Bring it here!

382
01:01:58,573 --> 01:01:59,449
Ushna?

383
01:02:49,733 --> 01:02:53,009
lt's a miracle, this boy is still alive.

384
01:02:54,213 --> 01:02:56,044
Medication has no effect.

385
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:05,689
His lungs are empty!

386
01:03:07,293 --> 01:03:10,091
As if someone stole his breath.

387
01:03:21,053 --> 01:03:22,406
Where is its owner, where?

388
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:24,363
Up there.

389
01:03:38,693 --> 01:03:39,523
Ushna!

390
01:03:40,533 --> 01:03:41,488
l'm coming.

391
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,004
Jalan!

392
01:04:02,853 --> 01:04:03,922
What've you done to yourself?.

393
01:04:16,213 --> 01:04:19,364
l thought you had perished...

394
01:04:21,493 --> 01:04:23,290
Jalan, l have heard there's a place
for us .... in the Valley Of Flowers.

395
01:04:28,613 --> 01:04:32,128
Do you know, Jalan ...when the wind blows
through millions of flowers

396
01:04:32,693 --> 01:04:35,844
it sounds like ocean.

397
01:04:37,213 --> 01:04:40,093
l want to live there with you,

398
01:04:40,093 --> 01:04:42,448
until death.

399
01:04:43,533 --> 01:04:45,603
How about going
through the Valley of Silence

400
01:04:45,693 --> 01:04:48,605
before going to the Valley of Flowers?

401
01:04:48,693 --> 01:04:49,762
Valley of Silence?

402
01:04:50,773 --> 01:04:54,482
l met this young disciple
in the monastery.

403
01:04:55,253 --> 01:04:57,642
He'd escaped from a shrine
in the Valley of Silence.

404
01:04:58,573 --> 01:05:01,485
There, a Yogi named Atman,

405
01:05:02,053 --> 01:05:04,044
secretly makes an elixir of immortality.

406
01:05:07,893 --> 01:05:08,530
Ushna?

407
01:05:15,533 --> 01:05:16,602
lmmortality?

408
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:20,601
Deathlessness.

409
01:06:08,093 --> 01:06:08,809
Sound?

410
01:06:13,173 --> 01:06:14,447
Valley of Silence.

411
01:06:20,813 --> 01:06:24,408
No sound except human voices.

412
01:06:26,053 --> 01:06:26,724
We're voices.

413
01:06:29,373 --> 01:06:30,283
Come on.

414
01:06:40,573 --> 01:06:44,282
Ushna, leave the horse ...

415
01:06:44,813 --> 01:06:46,693
l'm scared, Jalan!

416
01:06:46,693 --> 01:06:50,003
Just follow me.

417
01:08:42,013 --> 01:08:42,889
Come on!

418
01:08:44,093 --> 01:08:45,128
To life!

419
01:08:45,853 --> 01:08:47,002
To deathlessness.

420
01:09:03,693 --> 01:09:05,411
For times to come.

421
01:10:37,973 --> 01:10:43,001
Your time has come.

422
01:10:44,133 --> 01:10:48,046
Congratulations on catching us ...

423
01:10:49,213 --> 01:10:49,850
Hold back!

424
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:52,169
What're you doing?

425
01:10:54,373 --> 01:10:55,726
l want to make your task easy.

426
01:10:55,813 --> 01:10:56,962
Don't be ridiculous, Jalan!

427
01:10:58,613 --> 01:10:59,329
Ushna!

428
01:11:00,493 --> 01:11:02,643
l'm only trying
to save you from yourself.

429
01:11:16,493 --> 01:11:18,131
You're making a big mistake.

430
01:11:18,933 --> 01:11:21,049
Things are not the way
you understand ...

431
01:11:23,973 --> 01:11:24,928
You know nothing!

432
01:12:01,453 --> 01:12:02,283
Ushna.

433
01:12:07,613 --> 01:12:08,284
Ushna.

434
01:12:10,053 --> 01:12:10,724
Ushna.

435
01:12:11,373 --> 01:12:12,010
Ushna.

436
01:12:14,333 --> 01:12:15,129
Ushna.

437
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:10,369
My intention was not to kill you.

438
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:14,969
My intention was never to kill you.

439
01:13:26,093 --> 01:13:29,005
l can't think of no worse punishment

440
01:13:30,413 --> 01:13:31,846
than to let you live forever.

441
01:17:30,133 --> 01:17:31,202
You fucking bastard,

442
01:17:31,293 --> 01:17:32,885
Why are you here?
l'm against what you do.

443
01:17:33,773 --> 01:17:35,684
Leave Japan!

444
01:17:43,053 --> 01:17:43,883
Quick, please!

445
01:18:46,773 --> 01:18:47,728
Konnichiwa.

446
01:18:49,173 --> 01:18:50,322
Konnichiwa.

447
01:18:51,533 --> 01:18:52,329
Toshiro.

448
01:18:53,133 --> 01:18:54,009
Chiharu.

449
01:18:55,613 --> 01:18:57,092
Are you certain?

450
01:18:57,173 --> 01:18:58,083
No!

451
01:18:59,853 --> 01:19:03,533
Please! Stop it!

452
01:19:03,533 --> 01:19:05,285
l beg you, stop.

453
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:06,693
Brother, let me!

454
01:19:06,693 --> 01:19:08,251
Leave me!

455
01:19:08,573 --> 01:19:10,450
l can take care of you mum, dad!

456
01:19:11,013 --> 01:19:15,882
Please, stop it!

457
01:19:19,573 --> 01:19:20,289
Yuki.

458
01:19:48,293 --> 01:19:52,127
We are a burden on our children.

459
01:19:53,893 --> 01:19:55,406
We tried everything

460
01:19:56,653 --> 01:19:59,121
and every kind of medicine ...

461
01:20:02,773 --> 01:20:05,082
We no longer want to suffer

462
01:20:05,933 --> 01:20:07,332
in front of them...

463
01:20:09,253 --> 01:20:10,845
or anyone.

464
01:20:15,933 --> 01:20:16,763
Yuki ...

465
01:20:25,493 --> 01:20:26,767
Remember. Don't cry.

466
01:20:30,773 --> 01:20:32,843
We are all together on this.

467
01:20:34,453 --> 01:20:35,966
There is nothing to fear.

468
01:20:45,413 --> 01:20:51,010
May we take on the suffering of everyone
who has this terrible illness.

469
01:20:52,493 --> 01:20:59,012
May they be free from this affliction
and from their suffering.

470
01:21:07,333 --> 01:21:08,083
Come.

471
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:18,606
Please, lie down.

472
01:22:49,693 --> 01:22:51,843
May l be a protector

473
01:22:52,773 --> 01:22:55,003
to those without protection,

474
01:22:56,973 --> 01:22:59,441
A leader for those who journey,

475
01:23:00,133 --> 01:23:01,532
and a boat,

476
01:23:01,613 --> 01:23:03,444
a bridge,

477
01:23:03,533 --> 01:23:04,966
a passage

478
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,729
for those desiring the future shore.

479
01:23:09,533 --> 01:23:13,924
May the pain of every living creature
be completely cleared away ...

480
01:23:14,493 --> 01:23:16,006
May l be the doctor

481
01:23:16,573 --> 01:23:17,562
and the medicine,

482
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:20,403
and may l be the nurse,

483
01:23:20,853 --> 01:23:23,003
for all those sick beings in the world,

484
01:23:23,093 --> 01:23:26,529
until everyone is healed ...

485
01:23:26,613 --> 01:23:30,083
Just like space,
and the great elements such as earth.

486
01:23:31,613 --> 01:23:36,050
May l alway support the life
of all the boundless creatures.

487
01:23:37,773 --> 01:23:44,087
And until they pass away from pain,

488
01:23:45,013 --> 01:23:46,128
may l also be the source of life,

489
01:23:46,213 --> 01:23:51,446
for all those realms of varied beings,
that teaches unto the ends of space ...

490
01:24:26,093 --> 01:24:26,923
Grandma!

491
01:24:31,933 --> 01:24:32,968
Excuse her.

492
01:25:40,813 --> 01:25:42,804
LET NATURE DO lTS JOB!!!

493
01:25:42,893 --> 01:25:45,851
NO TO EUTHANASlA!!!

494
01:25:45,933 --> 01:25:48,925
LEAVE JAPAN!

495
01:25:59,173 --> 01:26:02,290
Does your family know
about your condition?

496
01:26:02,933 --> 01:26:03,888
Yes.

497
01:26:05,213 --> 01:26:07,124
My condition ... They know.

498
01:26:09,253 --> 01:26:12,404
Forgive me for asking, but what exactly
was the ailment you spoke to me?

499
01:26:13,173 --> 01:26:14,322
Cancer.

500
01:26:14,413 --> 01:26:15,846
Cancer of?.

501
01:26:16,453 --> 01:26:18,011
Cancer of the ...

502
01:26:18,093 --> 01:26:19,685
Here, the liver.

503
01:26:20,933 --> 01:26:21,888
Hepatic cancer.

504
01:26:22,653 --> 01:26:23,847
Yes, yes, that's it.

505
01:26:24,773 --> 01:26:27,651
l can never remember the proper name.

506
01:26:30,293 --> 01:26:31,573
Yes indeed,

507
01:26:31,573 --> 01:26:41,050
it's always hard
to remember what is killing us.

508
01:26:43,653 --> 01:26:45,848
Enough, Mr. Sakamoto.

509
01:26:52,933 --> 01:26:54,366
l don't do suicides.

510
01:26:58,093 --> 01:26:58,889
Farewell.

511
01:27:01,373 --> 01:27:04,365
Wait! Please! l can explain.

512
01:27:04,933 --> 01:27:06,651
From man to man,

513
01:27:07,933 --> 01:27:12,449
just hear me out.

514
01:27:14,933 --> 01:27:18,084
l've been hiding for two weeks.

515
01:27:21,973 --> 01:27:24,487
l can never face
the world outside again.

516
01:27:32,933 --> 01:27:35,322
Mr. Sakamoto, with time,
everything of this nature passes

517
01:27:36,573 --> 01:27:38,803
it's not worth ending your life over.

518
01:27:38,893 --> 01:27:41,009
l'll be the judge of that.

519
01:27:41,093 --> 01:27:43,093
Ultimately, you are the judge,

520
01:27:43,093 --> 01:27:46,005
but l'll not be a part of this.

521
01:27:46,093 --> 01:27:46,809
Wait!

522
01:27:48,813 --> 01:27:50,451
We signed a contract!

523
01:27:50,533 --> 01:27:52,967
You're legally bound to help me,

524
01:27:53,053 --> 01:27:54,771
and if you don't,

525
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:57,367
l'll sue Valley of Flowers Corp...

526
01:27:57,453 --> 01:27:58,852
You lied about your illness.

527
01:28:00,893 --> 01:28:02,565
The contract is null and void!

528
01:28:03,893 --> 01:28:04,643
Now please clear out.

529
01:28:04,733 --> 01:28:05,722
Wait!

530
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,213
Look at you,

531
01:28:07,213 --> 01:28:09,204
Bankrupt CEO fucks his secretary

532
01:28:09,773 --> 01:28:11,092
A coward, that's what you get.

533
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,051
And look at you!

534
01:28:19,573 --> 01:28:21,404
You're scared shit, aren't you?

535
01:28:21,493 --> 01:28:25,805
You are horrified to face your own nature,
like millions out there.

536
01:28:26,893 --> 01:28:28,849
You want to dominate nature ...

537
01:28:28,933 --> 01:28:31,401
by killing cowards.

538
01:28:34,533 --> 01:28:38,526
That makes you a coward, too.

539
01:28:46,693 --> 01:28:47,489
Where are you taking me?

540
01:28:47,573 --> 01:28:50,929
Let's go dying, Mr Sakamoto.

541
01:29:04,693 --> 01:29:05,682
Come on, Mr. Sakamoto.

542
01:29:06,493 --> 01:29:07,209
Come on.

543
01:29:10,693 --> 01:29:11,603
Come on.

544
01:29:13,733 --> 01:29:14,563
Jump!

545
01:29:15,533 --> 01:29:16,409
Jump!

546
01:29:23,693 --> 01:29:24,762
Mr. Sakamoto.

547
01:29:26,413 --> 01:29:27,971
You really want to die, don't you?

548
01:29:29,613 --> 01:29:31,524
You need to help me.
l can't do it alone.

549
01:29:34,093 --> 01:29:35,128
Mr. Sakamoto.

550
01:29:36,693 --> 01:29:38,411
Just follow me. You can do it.

551
01:29:39,533 --> 01:29:40,568
We can talk...

552
01:29:41,933 --> 01:29:43,412
Mr. Sakamoto ...

553
01:30:28,053 --> 01:30:29,771
You are insane!

554
01:30:30,413 --> 01:30:32,165
Who is the coward now?

555
01:32:20,933 --> 01:32:23,163
...the unknown man who fell 62 stories

556
01:32:23,253 --> 01:32:25,847
is none other than
the highly controversial lndian Doctor,

557
01:32:25,933 --> 01:32:30,961
Jalan Otsal,
of the Valley of Flowers Corporation ...

558
01:32:31,053 --> 01:32:31,405
He lies dead on the road.

559
01:32:31,493 --> 01:32:33,529
Otsal's practice of Euthanasia

560
01:32:33,613 --> 01:32:35,763
had drawn worldwide attention,
and clientele.

561
01:32:35,853 --> 01:32:39,293
Although it is illegal

562
01:32:39,293 --> 01:32:41,045
to practice Euthanasia in Japan,

563
01:32:41,133 --> 01:32:45,046
Dr. Otsal could have tried to sneak ...

564
01:32:46,693 --> 01:32:47,682
... wait a minute!

565
01:32:47,773 --> 01:32:50,492
Dr. Jalan Otsal is NOT dead!

566
01:32:50,573 --> 01:32:52,768
He's ALlVE! He just stood up

567
01:32:53,293 --> 01:32:55,329
after falling 62 stories!
Perfectly unharmed!

568
01:32:55,413 --> 01:32:56,687
Unbelievable...

569
01:33:07,173 --> 01:33:08,891
You're under arrest.

570
01:33:34,293 --> 01:33:39,526
l volunteer to speed the process
of natural death.

571
01:33:40,533 --> 01:33:42,012
l do not help people commit suicide.

572
01:33:42,493 --> 01:33:44,211
Where is the difference between

573
01:33:45,333 --> 01:33:47,449
speeding up natural death or murder?

574
01:33:48,173 --> 01:33:49,925
No words can explain that.

575
01:33:52,133 --> 01:33:53,327
l'm going to ask you again,

576
01:33:55,093 --> 01:33:57,209
and believe me,

577
01:33:57,973 --> 01:34:01,727
giving me these ridiculous answers
is not going to help us,

578
01:34:03,853 --> 01:34:05,127
- Mr.
- Dr.!

579
01:34:06,573 --> 01:34:08,962
l am telling you
nothing but the truth.

580
01:34:12,013 --> 01:34:13,082
Dr. Otsal,

581
01:34:15,853 --> 01:34:18,083
have you had suicidal tendencies
in the past?

582
01:34:20,293 --> 01:34:22,443
Yes.
l've made 2024 attempts at suicide.

583
01:34:22,533 --> 01:34:25,613
What? 2024?

584
01:34:25,613 --> 01:34:26,250
Yes.

585
01:34:27,093 --> 01:34:28,572
Dr. Otsal,

586
01:34:30,933 --> 01:34:31,843
how old are you?

587
01:34:35,973 --> 01:34:37,531
l'm 197 years old.

588
01:34:42,653 --> 01:34:43,722
Stop. Release him!

589
01:34:47,373 --> 01:34:48,567
l know him..

590
01:35:08,413 --> 01:35:10,244
Thanks to him, you're free.

591
01:37:46,773 --> 01:37:47,842
l have something to tell you.

592
01:38:26,173 --> 01:38:26,923
Ushna?!

593
01:38:28,533 --> 01:38:29,283
Ushna?!

594
01:38:30,133 --> 01:38:30,770
Jalan.

595
01:38:32,613 --> 01:38:33,728
ls that you, Ushna?

596
01:38:58,973 --> 01:39:01,407
No, Jalan, you don't understand.

597
01:39:02,653 --> 01:39:04,848
l've done some demonic things.

598
01:39:05,453 --> 01:39:06,886
Nothing matters, now you are mine.

599
01:39:14,373 --> 01:39:16,045
l don't belong here.

600
01:39:22,413 --> 01:39:23,732
We belong together.

601
01:39:27,013 --> 01:39:32,531
Once l had tasted your love

602
01:39:32,613 --> 01:39:34,888
l knew there would be no turning back.

603
01:39:40,053 --> 01:39:48,085
Since then l'm paying for my karma.

604
01:39:49,853 --> 01:39:50,922
To die,

605
01:39:53,253 --> 01:39:54,606
being born.

606
01:39:58,493 --> 01:39:59,528
To die again

607
01:40:01,293 --> 01:40:03,090
and being reborn.

608
01:40:10,813 --> 01:40:13,168
Transmigrating five times.

609
01:40:18,973 --> 01:40:21,043
Now in my fifth reincarnation,
l can't stand it anymore.

610
01:40:32,173 --> 01:40:36,371
l remember absolutely nothing
of my past lives

611
01:40:37,333 --> 01:40:39,563
except of the love and lover l chose.

612
01:40:44,213 --> 01:40:45,885
One memory,

613
01:40:47,893 --> 01:40:49,485
to carry with me from life to life ...

614
01:40:52,293 --> 01:40:54,045
The eternal longing.

615
01:41:03,533 --> 01:41:05,489
Even as a new-born baby

616
01:41:09,013 --> 01:41:10,890
l longed for you and your love.

617
01:41:51,133 --> 01:41:52,327
The center of universe.

618
01:43:08,453 --> 01:43:12,287
l know only one thing, today.

619
01:43:12,373 --> 01:43:13,362
What?

620
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:17,413
l've been wanting to die for years,

621
01:43:17,413 --> 01:43:19,449
and now, l want to live.

622
01:43:21,893 --> 01:43:25,602
You will live forever...

623
01:43:26,293 --> 01:43:27,442
...but l ...?

624
01:43:32,213 --> 01:43:33,885
For times to come.

625
01:43:55,133 --> 01:43:56,202
Please keep looking into my eyes.

626
01:45:15,973 --> 01:45:17,804
Laws of Karma.

627
01:45:20,253 --> 01:45:23,165
Laws of impermanence.

628
01:45:37,653 --> 01:45:44,968
One who can turn conflict
into collaboration

629
01:45:45,533 --> 01:45:46,761
is the Buddha.

630
01:45:50,573 --> 01:45:51,323
What do you want?

631
01:48:57,853 --> 01:48:58,888
Why?

632
01:49:05,213 --> 01:49:06,248
Why?

633
01:49:07,493 --> 01:49:08,448
Why?

634
01:49:09,493 --> 01:49:10,369
Why?

635
01:49:19,933 --> 01:49:22,367
l am just doing my duty.

636
01:49:24,253 --> 01:49:26,130
l am just doing.

637
01:49:28,293 --> 01:49:30,727
The balance is restored.

638
01:49:33,493 --> 01:49:34,482
You promised me

639
01:49:36,613 --> 01:49:38,683
that you'll give us more time together.

640
01:49:41,093 --> 01:49:42,731
Your sacrifice...

641
01:49:43,373 --> 01:49:46,126
...is your true love.

642
01:50:11,813 --> 01:50:13,166
Farewell.
