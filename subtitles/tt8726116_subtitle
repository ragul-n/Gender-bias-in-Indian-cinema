MAIN TITLE

4
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:25,130
I remember that 30 years ago,
this place was a part of the sea.

5
00:03:25,963 --> 00:03:28,505
It's nothing but reclaimed land now.

6
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:34,088
In 30 years, even the ports of Keppel
and Tanjong Pagar will move here.

7
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,130
Look.

8
00:03:39,505 --> 00:03:41,338
How do you remember...

9
00:03:42,546 --> 00:03:43,921
what it was like 30 years ago?

10
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,171
Where's the driver of the missing truck?
I want to question him.

11
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,380
Wang? I haven't seen him.

12
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:07,005
Is he coming to the site today?

13
00:04:07,421 --> 00:04:11,546
Maybe. See how many workers
we have here, officer?

14
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,963
They come to work if they want
to get paid.

15
00:04:17,505 --> 00:04:19,588
Officer, my nephew, Jason.

16
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:24,296
This officer is looking for
Wang's contact information. Help him out.

17
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,630
They often use prepaid numbers
and change without notifying us.

18
00:04:34,005 --> 00:04:35,046
- Uncle.
- Yes.

19
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,255
Please check out this blue-colored file.

20
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:38,838
The project is going to start tomorrow.

21
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:40,713
I'll let you know later.

22
00:04:40,963 --> 00:04:43,380
Also, Ali was looking for you just now
when you weren't around.

23
00:04:43,463 --> 00:04:45,046
Wang hasn't come to work in a week.

24
00:04:45,755 --> 00:04:47,046
That bastard!

25
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,088
I was so kind to give him an easy job.

26
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:53,338
I should have sent him back to China.

27
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:58,713
They seem to come to work
as and when they like.

28
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,421
It's pretty relaxed here, right?

29
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,005
Officer.

30
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,588
Don't cause me any trouble, okay?

31
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:09,671
Okay?

32
00:05:11,796 --> 00:05:13,005
I can guarantee you

33
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:16,255
it's not at all relaxed here.

34
00:05:17,046 --> 00:05:19,213
Got the number you wanted?

35
00:05:19,713 --> 00:05:20,796
- Jason.
- Yes?

36
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,171
Can I trouble you
to send this officer out?

37
00:05:26,255 --> 00:05:27,880
Come over.

38
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:30,671
- If got any problem, come over.
- Your uncle's got a sense of humor.

39
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,463
Wang didn't fill up the logbook.

40
00:05:34,505 --> 00:05:35,755
He didn't keep a log?

41
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:37,796
He drives the company truck.

42
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,880
He didn't come to work.
Aren't you afraid he'd run off?

43
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,755
We hold on to their passports.

44
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:49,171
In case they lose it.

45
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,505
How do people live like this?

46
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:37,171
There.

47
00:06:51,338 --> 00:06:52,630
Careful of the bedbugs.

48
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,255
Is there a Wang Bicheng here?

49
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:25,005
Hey.

50
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,880
We're talking to you.

51
00:07:30,713 --> 00:07:31,630
Hey.

52
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:32,963
Where does Wang Bicheng sleep?

53
00:07:33,546 --> 00:07:34,380
Hey.

54
00:07:39,796 --> 00:07:41,963
When did you last see him?

55
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,005
I don't know.

56
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,755
Damn it, how do you not know?
You sleep right across him.

57
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:48,380
I'm not his mother. How would I know?

58
00:07:49,255 --> 00:07:50,713
You have no manners!

59
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,296
For fuck's sake!
What the hell is wrong with you?

60
00:07:54,505 --> 00:07:56,421
He didn't come back at all last night.

61
00:07:57,755 --> 00:07:58,838
What about the night before?

62
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:01,421
How would I know?

63
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:03,088
So many stupid questions.

64
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,296
He doesn't sleep here.

65
00:08:05,963 --> 00:08:07,630
If not here, where then?

66
00:08:07,713 --> 00:08:09,005
Who knows?

67
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:11,296
He's out almost every night.

68
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:13,921
Sleeping pills.

69
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:17,213
With all that physical labor in the day,

70
00:08:17,588 --> 00:08:18,630
how is he still sleepless?

71
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:20,505
Why wouldn't he be?

72
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:23,130
After he broke his arm,
he could only drive.

73
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:25,838
Unlike us, suffering hardship.

74
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:27,630
I wish I had his life.

75
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:30,505
Do you want to break a limb too?
I can help.

76
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:37,046
Sorry to disturb you.

77
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,338
Haven't you been
to the land reclamation site?

78
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,880
Go ask the blackies there.

79
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:51,213
Wang is good friends with one of them.

80
00:09:11,213 --> 00:09:12,213
It's so bright here.

81
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,838
How do they sleep?

82
00:10:23,171 --> 00:10:25,296
Hey, where's Ajit?

83
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:31,588
Ajit is not here. He might come later.

84
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:33,505
Okay, sit down. Come.

85
00:11:49,171 --> 00:11:52,130
KANGNINGDA MEDICINE

86
00:11:52,213 --> 00:11:56,130
DIAZEPAM

87
00:14:54,171 --> 00:14:55,255
Are you unable to sleep too?

88
00:14:57,421 --> 00:14:58,463
Fuck.

89
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,505
24 HOURS E-LOVER CYBERCAFE

90
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:54,838
How many hours?

91
00:15:56,296 --> 00:15:57,463
I am just looking around.

92
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,296
The air-conditioning is not free here.

93
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,338
Sorry about that.

94
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:33,796
<i>Ajit didn't return
to the dormitory last night.</i>

95
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,588
<i>Wang Bicheng's phone can't be reached.</i>

96
00:17:38,671 --> 00:17:40,546
<i>It's like the two vanished</i>

97
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,755
and no one is looking for them.

98
00:17:45,505 --> 00:17:47,338
Except us two idiots.

99
00:17:49,421 --> 00:17:51,963
We're paid by the taxpayers,
working for the state,

100
00:17:52,046 --> 00:17:55,296
to look for two workers where no one
is sure whether they are dead or alive.

101
00:17:58,463 --> 00:17:59,755
Do you think they're dead?

102
00:18:00,171 --> 00:18:01,921
So you think they are alive?

103
00:18:05,546 --> 00:18:06,630
Crap!

104
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,046
What, never seen a nosebleed before?
It's hot out here.

105
00:18:13,005 --> 00:18:15,463
Do you think they have the luxury
to skip work?

106
00:18:15,838 --> 00:18:18,838
A few days' wages is a fortune to them.

107
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:20,921
So, are they dead or alive?
What do you think?

108
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,338
I dreamed of Wang Bicheng last night.

109
00:18:31,088 --> 00:18:32,838
How would you know it was him?

110
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:35,546
You've never met nor spoken to him.

111
00:18:38,255 --> 00:18:40,088
<i>I used to dream a lot when I was young.</i>

112
00:18:41,505 --> 00:18:44,380
<i>I dreamed of all these bizarre things
and mysterious places</i>

113
00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:48,046
<i>and I thought I was very imaginative.</i>

114
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,963
<i>After I grew up and started traveling,
I realized then</i>

115
00:18:53,963 --> 00:18:57,255
<i>I had been to all those places before,
in my dreams.</i>

116
00:18:57,796 --> 00:19:02,671
<i>The strange thing is, I never actually saw
those places as a child.</i>

117
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:12,380
You want to know how I knew
I was Wang Bicheng in the dream?

118
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,213
Call the ambulance!

119
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,046
Why are you so careless?

120
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,296
Are your fingers still intact?
The rest, go back to work!

121
00:19:35,796 --> 00:19:38,880
Ajit, you stay here with him.
Make sure nobody touches him, okay?

122
00:20:08,255 --> 00:20:09,963
Wait a little longer, he'll be back soon.

123
00:20:27,005 --> 00:20:27,880
Does it still hurt?

124
00:20:29,713 --> 00:20:31,588
Hey, did you lose your tongue?

125
00:20:34,421 --> 00:20:36,755
Man, you screamed like a bitch earlier.

126
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,796
Come, let me take a look.

127
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:42,713
Can you feel anything?

128
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:46,755
What did the doctor say?

129
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:50,255
Jason.

130
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:53,963
How long did the doctor say he will need?

131
00:20:56,255 --> 00:21:00,880
The doctor said it will take
three to four weeks with proper care.

132
00:21:02,046 --> 00:21:04,005
Guess we won't have to replace him.

133
00:21:04,546 --> 00:21:06,796
Just call him back to work
after his recovery.

134
00:21:09,505 --> 00:21:11,630
Then what should he do in the meantime?

135
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:15,088
How should I know?
Tell him to take a vacation.

136
00:21:15,963 --> 00:21:18,296
He's only been in Singapore
for half a year.

137
00:21:18,671 --> 00:21:20,505
Tell him to go to Sentosa Resort Island

138
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:23,838
with beaches, babes and the casino there.

139
00:21:24,505 --> 00:21:26,005
I don't know! Whatever he likes.

140
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,213
- Uncle.
- Yes?

141
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,588
What if he helps me drive the truck
to fetch the Bangladeshis?

142
00:21:33,963 --> 00:21:36,213
So that I can spend more time on site?

143
00:21:41,255 --> 00:21:42,088
Hey!

144
00:21:42,171 --> 00:21:43,796
Can you drive with that arm?

145
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,546
We only cover your medical costs,
not your funeral.

146
00:21:49,838 --> 00:21:51,088
Yes, I can do it.

147
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:53,838
Let's set this straight.

148
00:21:54,755 --> 00:21:55,963
It's going to be half your pay.

149
00:21:56,338 --> 00:21:58,046
Don't come back to me later whining.

150
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:35,213
24 HOURS E-LOVER CYBERCAFE

151
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,921
I only need to adjust something
on my computer.

152
00:23:56,588 --> 00:23:57,921
Isn't that stimulating?

153
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:02,671
Video call?

154
00:24:04,046 --> 00:24:05,005
Gaming?

155
00:24:06,296 --> 00:24:07,296
Pornography?

156
00:24:12,255 --> 00:24:13,338
Watch a film then.

157
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:15,213
The air-conditioning is not free here.

158
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:23,046
Chinese films,

159
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,505
American,

160
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,213
Bollywood.

161
00:24:27,671 --> 00:24:29,380
We don't have porn though.

162
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:34,088
But if you want to watch,

163
00:24:34,421 --> 00:24:35,421
I'll help you look for it.

164
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:57,755
Pick a computer.

165
00:24:58,255 --> 00:24:59,546
I'll pick the film.

166
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,255
When are you going home?

167
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:43,713
After I get paid.

168
00:26:11,421 --> 00:26:12,380
Thank you.

169
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:19,880
- Did they pay you?
- Yes.

170
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,463
- And you?
- No.

171
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,463
We didn't get this month's salary.

172
00:26:29,046 --> 00:26:33,046
- Did you get a call from home?
- It's already the 13th.

173
00:27:22,755 --> 00:27:24,171
Brother, are you okay?

174
00:27:27,463 --> 00:27:30,505
Guys, come down and help push.

175
00:27:30,588 --> 00:27:32,713
Please get down.

176
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,171
- Please get down.
- Please get down.

177
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,546
Slowly.

178
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:46,088
Easy...

179
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:48,255
Keep it to the side.

180
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,463
Ajit.

181
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:24,796
What?

182
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,088
My name, it's Ajit.

183
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:30,755
Wang Bicheng.

184
00:28:31,338 --> 00:28:32,338
Wang Bi?

185
00:28:32,713 --> 00:28:33,546
Wang.

186
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:35,380
- Wang.
- Wang. Okay.

187
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:37,505
Be careful next time, brother.

188
00:28:40,755 --> 00:28:42,713
Big, small...

189
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:44,463
Not the same.

190
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:47,088
No, but they won't see it.

191
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,171
Come help me.

192
00:28:59,046 --> 00:29:02,380
If we get there in time,
the foreman won't know about this.

193
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
You can't sleep?

194
00:29:18,338 --> 00:29:19,171
It's itchy.

195
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,588
You'd better sleep.

196
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:23,588
You have to drive.

197
00:29:23,921 --> 00:29:25,713
Have you slept at all
since you broke your arm?

198
00:29:27,546 --> 00:29:29,255
Look at you. Damn.

199
00:29:37,838 --> 00:29:38,755
Here.

200
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:40,713
This soothes the bedbug bites.

201
00:29:43,005 --> 00:29:44,421
I just can't reach it.

202
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:47,630
Use the other hand then.

203
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:50,255
People like us got to learn to adapt.

204
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:54,338
By switching between right and left hand,
you will have different pleasures.

205
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:56,130
Understand?

206
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:02,755
I say you're a lucky devil.

207
00:30:03,088 --> 00:30:04,880
You know Hao, the crane operator?

208
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:07,546
He'll be sent back at month's end.

209
00:30:07,671 --> 00:30:09,546
He can forget about coming back.

210
00:30:11,046 --> 00:30:13,255
- He asked me to join him.
- You're lucky

211
00:30:13,338 --> 00:30:15,005
you didn't make the headlines.

212
00:30:22,255 --> 00:30:23,421
Boy, he got it good.

213
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:28,171
Going home to greet his mother
with a shitload of debt.

214
00:30:29,338 --> 00:30:30,755
He might as well not have come here.

215
00:30:33,171 --> 00:30:39,296
Do you think things would be different
if we had all joined in?

216
00:30:41,588 --> 00:30:43,588
Careful there.

217
00:30:44,505 --> 00:30:46,463
I heard that he's organizing something

218
00:30:46,963 --> 00:30:48,463
to stop the deportation.

219
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:52,838
Just keep it.

220
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:58,296
Your tossing and turning
are keeping me up.

221
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,213
That's good then.

222
00:31:00,755 --> 00:31:02,338
Your snoring is so loud.

223
00:31:02,546 --> 00:31:04,046
I'm only doing everyone a favor.

224
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:06,088
Get lost.

225
00:31:33,255 --> 00:31:35,921
6 PAX

226
00:32:05,963 --> 00:32:06,921
Oh, stop.

227
00:32:09,963 --> 00:32:11,963
Fucking crap!

228
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:14,963
I didn't pay for this garbage! Fuck!

229
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:18,338
What are you doing?

230
00:32:18,421 --> 00:32:20,546
<i>- Go, go, go!</i>
- Crap! I'm breaking your shit!

231
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,463
- What's your problem?
- I'll break all these.

232
00:32:22,546 --> 00:32:24,755
I have a lot of money.
I can buy the whole shop!

233
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:26,296
What are you staring at?

234
00:32:26,421 --> 00:32:30,005
I'll pay you to suck me off,
that should shut you up.

235
00:32:30,338 --> 00:32:34,296
A fucking shop attendant
telling me what to do?

236
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,296
It's three, hurry!

237
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,713
I'm the filthy rich one here!

238
00:32:38,505 --> 00:32:40,380
Over here.

239
00:32:40,463 --> 00:32:42,088
(TERRORIST) TROLL862: SHE'S COMING

240
00:32:54,671 --> 00:32:56,588
Actions speak louder than words.

241
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:06,463
Is it dead?

242
00:33:08,213 --> 00:33:09,255
Does that excite you?

243
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:13,546
I see you come here every night
to get killed again and again.

244
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:16,755
Do you get a kick
out of getting fucked like that?

245
00:33:18,046 --> 00:33:19,588
I can't sleep, that's all.

246
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:21,213
I can help you with that.

247
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:25,921
I know hypnosis!

248
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:28,796
That doesn't work on me.

249
00:33:30,421 --> 00:33:34,838
How do you know
I haven't hypnotized you already?

250
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:38,630
I really don't need it.

251
00:33:39,838 --> 00:33:41,630
My dormitory is too stuffy,

252
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:44,671
so I'm looking for
somewhere cooler to sleep.

253
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:48,296
If it's air-conditioning you want,
you have the truck at the back.

254
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:54,130
I have a very boring job.

255
00:33:54,213 --> 00:33:56,338
There's a lot of time
to observe people here.

256
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:04,463
Isn't it stuffy here too?
Let's get some fresh air.

257
00:34:05,421 --> 00:34:07,171
Don't you need to be here?

258
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,005
And do what?

259
00:34:10,463 --> 00:34:12,130
Watch them destroy the computers?

260
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:53,545
Can you swim with that arm?

261
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:04,713
If you can beat me,
I'll make it worth your while.

262
00:36:37,463 --> 00:36:39,213
Luckily I turned back to look at you!

263
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:47,421
Otherwise, you'd have drowned out there.

264
00:37:22,838 --> 00:37:24,421
Do you see those little lights out there?

265
00:37:26,671 --> 00:37:27,755
I was thinking...

266
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,588
If I had swum out to them

267
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:33,630
and caught a boat,

268
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,630
I could have gotten out of here.

269
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,505
There is no need for visas.

270
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:40,880
There are no borders.

271
00:37:42,796 --> 00:37:44,630
That's true freedom.

272
00:37:48,671 --> 00:37:50,005
I don't have a boat.

273
00:37:51,171 --> 00:37:52,671
But I have a truck.

274
00:37:53,713 --> 00:37:55,213
Beggars can't be choosers.

275
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:02,505
I heard...

276
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,213
This area used to be a part of the sea.

277
00:38:08,713 --> 00:38:10,005
Looking at its map,

278
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:17,005
Singapore's southern coast
is completely straight.

279
00:38:17,255 --> 00:38:19,505
As if someone drew a line.

280
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,921
It's from Malaysia.

281
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:28,005
What?

282
00:38:29,463 --> 00:38:33,463
The sand here.
It's imported from Malaysia.

283
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,630
Other reclaimed parts of Singapore
are from Indonesia and Vietnam.

284
00:38:39,296 --> 00:38:42,088
I heard that Cambodia supplies
our construction site.

285
00:38:42,796 --> 00:38:45,755
Some say it's bought off the black market.

286
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:51,713
Doesn't that mean
we're no longer in Singapore?

287
00:38:53,546 --> 00:38:55,296
We're actually lying in Malaysia!

288
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,463
In other words,
I don't need a boat or plane.

289
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:03,046
All I need is this.

290
00:39:06,338 --> 00:39:07,838
You sure know a thing or two!

291
00:39:11,588 --> 00:39:15,046
Next time, I can take you
to other reclaimed areas

292
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:17,588
to see the world!

293
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,421
What are we going to do then?
Let's not cause trouble.

294
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:34,838
- I knew it...
- Not so loud.

295
00:39:34,921 --> 00:39:36,130
This is bad.

296
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:38,755
We can't sit here and do nothing.

297
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:41,463
Let's ask Jason for a solution tomorrow.

298
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,630
He can't be trusted.

299
00:39:45,713 --> 00:39:47,421
Only a fool will trust him.

300
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,171
Watch what you say!

301
00:39:55,671 --> 00:39:58,171
AJIT: COME CANTEEN

302
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:03,505
Hey.

303
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:05,796
Is your hand okay?

304
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:10,505
The boss said, "Hand okay, work okay."

305
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,046
The boss will listen.

306
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:16,880
You'll do the driving, okay?

307
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,630
If you work today,
we'll not work together in the future.

308
00:40:28,921 --> 00:40:30,005
The boss will listen.

309
00:40:33,671 --> 00:40:34,546
You know...

310
00:40:36,463 --> 00:40:38,838
My mother got into an accident.

311
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:41,630
The doctor cut off her leg.

312
00:40:42,588 --> 00:40:44,046
My wife is taking care of her.

313
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:48,380
But she's alive.

314
00:40:50,213 --> 00:40:51,130
I'm happy.

315
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:53,130
I am.

316
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,338
DANGER
IN PROGRESS

317
00:43:12,713 --> 00:43:14,046
<i>Bomb has been planted.</i>

318
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:17,588
How do you know I come here every night?

319
00:43:20,296 --> 00:43:21,755
You sure have a lot of free time.

320
00:43:28,296 --> 00:43:30,546
Hey. Are you using me as bait?

321
00:44:05,796 --> 00:44:06,880
Hey, Wang.

322
00:44:07,296 --> 00:44:08,255
You stay.

323
00:44:08,921 --> 00:44:12,713
I'll come back. Stay, okay?

324
00:44:24,005 --> 00:44:25,463
Which fish you like?

325
00:44:27,046 --> 00:44:29,213
Which fish? You like fish?

326
00:44:29,296 --> 00:44:30,630
Good fish.

327
00:44:32,713 --> 00:44:34,671
- Big one?
- Yes.

328
00:44:36,088 --> 00:44:37,296
The big one is not good.

329
00:44:55,755 --> 00:44:58,796
How much is the fish?

330
00:45:03,171 --> 00:45:05,630
- Some of them don't like my skin color.
- You...

331
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,838
You need to go back.

332
00:45:10,088 --> 00:45:11,171
To see your mother.

333
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,546
No. I owe the company money.

334
00:45:17,713 --> 00:45:19,380
The boss has taken my passport.

335
00:45:20,713 --> 00:45:22,046
They won't let me go back.

336
00:46:16,963 --> 00:46:18,921
I know where the passports are.

337
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,713
I'll go take your passport.

338
00:46:21,713 --> 00:46:22,671
It's okay.

339
00:46:23,296 --> 00:46:24,671
Jason will help me.

340
00:46:25,755 --> 00:46:26,963
He will tell his uncle.

341
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,963
I can go home.

342
00:46:29,296 --> 00:46:32,171
No. Jason is not good.

343
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,296
Maybe you remember wrong.

344
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:37,671
You do not know Jason.

345
00:46:43,421 --> 00:46:44,755
After the accident,

346
00:46:46,171 --> 00:46:47,588
you did not sleep.

347
00:46:52,046 --> 00:46:53,130
You're very tired.

348
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:57,588
I...

349
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:06,296
I don't know.

350
00:47:09,755 --> 00:47:10,588
Many...

351
00:47:15,546 --> 00:47:16,755
I don't remember

352
00:47:17,463 --> 00:47:18,630
a lot of things.

353
00:47:22,421 --> 00:47:24,171
I don't even remember...

354
00:47:25,921 --> 00:47:27,005
how it feels to dream.

355
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:34,046
Ajit.

356
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,796
Do you dream?

357
00:47:43,005 --> 00:47:43,921
Yes.

358
00:47:45,755 --> 00:47:46,755
I dream.

359
00:47:49,671 --> 00:47:51,380
Here, I dream all the time.

360
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:54,880
<i>You are dancing.</i>

361
00:47:55,921 --> 00:47:56,963
<i>I am singing.</i>

362
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,088
<i>But I'm not me.</i>

363
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,796
<i>You're not you.</i>

364
00:48:19,921 --> 00:48:21,005
Jason is here.

365
00:48:22,796 --> 00:48:24,005
I'm going with him

366
00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:26,630
to take Hao to the airport now.

367
00:48:27,963 --> 00:48:29,005
Now?

368
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,588
- Airport?
- Yes.

369
00:48:32,713 --> 00:48:34,088
He asked for help.

370
00:48:35,255 --> 00:48:38,921
Maybe Hao doesn't want to go.

371
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:42,713
We'll talk tomorrow.

372
00:49:40,255 --> 00:49:41,171
Ajit?

373
00:49:46,546 --> 00:49:47,671
Where's Ajit?

374
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:11,921
<i>It's been three days.</i>

375
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,546
He hasn't answered my calls
or gone back to the dormitory.

376
00:50:22,213 --> 00:50:23,505
It's impossible.

377
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,088
He owes the company
months of advance payment.

378
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,796
Plus, they have our passports.

379
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:33,380
What are you talking about?

380
00:50:39,713 --> 00:50:41,046
Look at you, making friends.

381
00:50:42,588 --> 00:50:45,213
Nothing but creeps here, be careful.

382
00:50:52,505 --> 00:50:53,463
Isn't it hot?

383
00:50:55,421 --> 00:50:56,380
It's too hot.

384
00:50:57,671 --> 00:50:58,880
Let's go for a ride.

385
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,046
Get some fresh air.

386
00:51:03,338 --> 00:51:04,838
I don't have the truck anymore.

387
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,380
Just today? Or from today on?

388
00:51:17,505 --> 00:51:18,338
Never mind.

389
00:51:44,005 --> 00:51:45,088
Is your arm okay?

390
00:51:46,005 --> 00:51:47,588
It's raining. Let's pack up.

391
00:51:48,296 --> 00:51:49,296
Where's Ajit?

392
00:51:50,213 --> 00:51:52,088
He has gone back
to see his mother in Bangladesh.

393
00:51:53,213 --> 00:51:54,130
Liar.

394
00:51:56,005 --> 00:51:57,880
Wang, don't do anything stupid.

395
00:51:59,130 --> 00:52:01,130
Uncle!

CHINESE WORKER CAUSES TROUBLE
AT LAND RECLAMATION SITE

399
00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:42,213
Tell me! Where is he?

400
00:59:45,505 --> 00:59:47,296
You actually don't know anything.

401
00:59:49,463 --> 00:59:53,588
You only know how to hide
behind a computer to mess with me.

402
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,505
Have you had your fun?

403
00:59:58,796 --> 00:59:59,796
Where are you hiding?

404
01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:01,921
Show yourself if you have the guts!

405
01:00:02,921 --> 01:00:04,130
Show yourself!

406
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:10,713
What's all that shouting about?

407
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,255
Who is he?

408
01:00:17,588 --> 01:00:19,505
- Who is that TROLL862?
- Who?

409
01:00:19,713 --> 01:00:22,588
- Who are you talking about?
- How do I find TROLL862?

410
01:00:25,505 --> 01:00:26,755
You got ditched?

411
01:00:28,338 --> 01:00:30,005
Online relationships are heartless.

412
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:32,463
Good guys don't exist. Get used to it.

413
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,838
I'm not used to it. Nor do I want to be!

414
01:00:34,921 --> 01:00:36,505
Hey, don't be like that.

415
01:00:37,713 --> 01:00:39,463
It's impossible to find him
even if I want to.

416
01:00:41,421 --> 01:00:42,380
Wang Bicheng.

417
01:00:49,213 --> 01:00:50,088
Look at me.

418
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,921
When was the last time you slept?

419
01:00:57,005 --> 01:00:59,796
Like I told you, I can help you sleep.

420
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:01,713
Do you trust me?

421
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,171
Are you there?

422
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:03,380
Even you have gone.

423
01:04:18,338 --> 01:04:19,463
Is there anybody out there?

424
01:04:20,046 --> 01:04:21,588
<i>All right, let's move out.</i>

425
01:04:29,755 --> 01:04:31,755
I haven't slept so well in a long time.

426
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,255
<i>Fire, fire in the hole!</i>

427
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,380
<i>I think I had a dream.</i>

428
01:04:48,296 --> 01:04:51,171
<i>I dreamed of my own death.</i>

429
01:04:56,005 --> 01:04:56,963
<i>Actually,</i>

430
01:04:59,338 --> 01:05:01,338
<i>it's not my first time having such dreams.</i>

431
01:05:06,921 --> 01:05:08,588
<i>I'm not a morbid person.</i>

432
01:05:11,046 --> 01:05:12,171
<i>It's just that</i>

433
01:05:14,921 --> 01:05:16,755
<i>sometimes my imagination acts up.</i>

434
01:05:23,255 --> 01:05:26,380
<i>The feeling I had wasn't painful</i>

435
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:31,046
<i>or terrifying.</i>

436
01:05:34,755 --> 01:05:38,796
<i>It was like being swallowed by something.</i>

437
01:05:42,338 --> 01:05:44,088
<i>Slowly sinking downwards.</i>

438
01:05:48,630 --> 01:05:49,796
<i>It's hard to explain.</i>

439
01:05:52,255 --> 01:05:53,630
<i>It was as if</i>

440
01:05:56,588 --> 01:05:59,005
<i>I was being forgotten
by a kind of ignorance.</i>

441
01:06:03,963 --> 01:06:04,963
<i>At the end,</i>

442
01:06:08,046 --> 01:06:10,171
<i>I realized I had disappeared
in my own dream.</i>

443
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:18,963
<i>I dreamed of</i>

444
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:25,380
<i>two policemen investigating
my disappearance.</i>

445
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,796
<i>One of them was an insomniac too.</i>

446
01:06:33,421 --> 01:06:34,505
<i>As for the other,</i>

447
01:06:35,838 --> 01:06:37,755
<i>it'd be game over for him soon.</i>

448
01:06:42,255 --> 01:06:47,255
<i>They didn't particularly care about me.</i>

449
01:06:49,421 --> 01:06:51,213
<i>They were just doing their job.</i>

450
01:06:54,963 --> 01:06:56,671
<i>In fact, they were quite good at it.</i>

451
01:07:00,338 --> 01:07:01,630
<i>Their investigation</i>

452
01:07:05,713 --> 01:07:07,588
<i>had led them here.</i>

453
01:07:19,921 --> 01:07:20,880
It's you again.

454
01:07:24,713 --> 01:07:25,630
Fuck.

455
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,296
Have you seen him before?

456
01:07:32,755 --> 01:07:33,630
No.

457
01:07:35,088 --> 01:07:39,130
You want to look harder?
Or shall I look hard at your papers?

458
01:07:44,296 --> 01:07:45,380
Number 57.

459
01:07:52,838 --> 01:07:55,213
What did you talk about
the last time you saw him?

460
01:07:57,796 --> 01:07:59,296
He was looking for someone.

461
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,921
Looking for someone? A co-worker?

462
01:08:04,130 --> 01:08:07,171
It was an alias of an account.

463
01:08:07,255 --> 01:08:09,463
I think he was looking for a gamer here.

464
01:08:09,713 --> 01:08:10,671
What alias?

465
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:18,755
Troll 8... 3...

466
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:20,921
- Something.
- 862.

467
01:08:29,671 --> 01:08:32,505
TROLL862: I HEARD DEATH IN DREAMS

470
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:48,421
WBC31: SHALL WE MEET?

471
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:57,087
TROLL862: OKAY, OR MAYBE NOT, OFFICER.

472
01:08:57,755 --> 01:08:59,671
Is every computer here linked up?

473
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,962
You can talk if you put that on.

474
01:09:09,837 --> 01:09:13,755
Since you know I'm the police,
I seek your cooperation.

01:09:14,796 --> 01:09:16,296
<i>You must be the sleepless one.</i>

476
01:09:17,962 --> 01:09:19,462
<i>Wang Bicheng told me about you.</i>

477
01:09:22,712 --> 01:09:23,837
What else did he say?

478
01:09:25,421 --> 01:09:28,962
<i>He said death feels like being swallowed.</i>

479
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:32,171
<i>Sinking downwards,</i>

480
01:09:33,255 --> 01:09:35,087
<i>as though being forgotten by ignorance.</i>

481
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,630
- It's here.
- Hey.

482
01:09:40,671 --> 01:09:41,796
Where is he now?

483
01:09:43,671 --> 01:09:44,962
<i>He's been swallowed.</i>

484
01:09:46,671 --> 01:09:47,962
<i>Oh, I almost forgot.</i>

485
01:09:48,171 --> 01:09:50,880
<i>He said it would be game over
for your partner soon.</i>

486
01:10:20,921 --> 01:10:23,213
Drop the gun!

487
01:12:04,546 --> 01:12:07,046
You know how important land reclamation is
to the people on top.

488
01:12:09,171 --> 01:12:13,296
You're being investigated.
Why did you go back to the site?

489
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:18,255
So someone got himself ran over
while crossing the road.

490
01:12:18,588 --> 01:12:19,796
Why investigate me?

491
01:12:21,713 --> 01:12:23,130
Aren't you retiring soon?

492
01:12:24,046 --> 01:12:27,588
Just keep your head down for the next
few years. You'll get your pension soon.

Officer, can I help you?

502
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:16,296
I'm just looking around.

503
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,338
My uncle isn't around.
He doesn't want to see you.

504
01:14:21,713 --> 01:14:24,421
I just want to know what on earth
you people do here.

505
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:28,880
Let's take a walk.

506
01:15:38,463 --> 01:15:41,380
Didn't you want to know what we do here?

507
01:17:25,088 --> 01:17:27,046
How much longer will this go on for?

508
01:17:29,463 --> 01:17:33,880
We've never stopped reclaiming land.

509
01:17:34,505 --> 01:17:36,963
We'll reclaim for as long as we can.

510
01:17:38,755 --> 01:17:39,671
What do you think?

511
01:17:40,796 --> 01:17:44,588
What's the worth of a land that is capable
of being forged freely at our will?

512
01:17:45,546 --> 01:17:51,046
Officer, your question is too deep for me.

513
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:52,963
I hear you, but I'm not sure I get you.

01:18:21,546 --> 01:18:22,380
Ajit.

516
01:18:23,213 --> 01:18:24,130
Hello, sir.

517
01:18:25,463 --> 01:18:29,588
Mr. Lok is a policeman.
He wants to know if we treat you badly.

518
01:18:32,171 --> 01:18:35,213
Go on, it's okay. Tell the officer.

519
01:18:35,588 --> 01:18:38,713
If you have anything to complain,
if you don't like working for us,

520
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:40,338
just say it to him now.

521
01:18:43,546 --> 01:18:45,380
I am happy

522
01:18:46,255 --> 01:18:48,463

523
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:51,338
Are you sure?

Mr. Jason

525
01:18:57,588 --> 01:19:01,630
and the foreman take very good care of me.

526
01:19:02,380 --> 01:19:03,630
Do we pay you okay?

527
01:19:07,046 --> 01:19:07,880
Yes.

528
01:19:08,713 --> 01:19:09,838
The company

529
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:13,088
pays more

530
01:19:14,213 --> 01:19:15,463
than my friends

531
01:19:16,671 --> 01:19:20,380
who work in Malaysia, Indonesia,

532
01:19:21,963 --> 01:19:22,880

535
01:19:29,255 --> 01:19:33,505
than if I work in Bangladesh.

536
01:19:37,213 --> 01:19:40,755

<i>It's the seat with the best view,
don't you think?</i>

542
01:24:57,296 --> 01:24:58,713
So she's his type?

<i>I think he wasn't picky.
That's what happens when you're lonely.</i>

544
01:25:06,755 --> 01:25:08,213
Aren't you lonely too?

545
01:25:13,505 --> 01:25:14,713
<i>Fucking crap!</i>

546
01:25:15,130 --> 01:25:18,046
<i>- I didn't pay for this garbage! Fuck!</i>
- Fucking hell.

547
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:19,546
<i>What are you doing?</i>

548
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:21,171
<i>- Crap! I'm breaking your shit!</i>
- Fuck!

549
01:25:21,255 --> 01:25:23,171
<i>- What's your problem?
- I'll break all these.</i>

550
01:25:23,255 --> 01:25:25,588
<i>I have a lot of money.
I can buy the whole shop!</i>

551
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:26,921
<i>What are you staring at?</i>

552
01:25:27,005 --> 01:25:30,463
<i>I'll pay you to suck me off,
that should shut you up.</i>

553
01:25:31,046 --> 01:25:35,421
<i>A fucking shop attendant
telling me what to do?</i>

554
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:38,005
<i>I'm the filthy rich one here!
Motherfucker.</i>

555
01:25:43,546 --> 01:25:44,630
Motherfucker.

556
01:25:57,838 --> 01:25:59,421
Hey, what are you doing?

557
01:26:09,796 --> 01:26:11,421
Wait for me, darling.

558
01:26:12,338 --> 01:26:13,338
Get lost!

559
01:26:43,338 --> 01:26:44,796
He came to see you every night?

560
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:53,796
I kind of miss those creepy eyes
leering at me.

561
01:26:59,088 --> 01:27:01,796
He would take me out in his truck.

562
01:27:02,546 --> 01:27:03,755
Where to?

563
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:08,213
Depends on the mood.

564
01:27:08,546 --> 01:27:11,005
Sometimes we would go to Malaysia.

565
01:27:11,088 --> 01:27:16,505
Other times, Indonesia, Vietnam,
and Cambodia too.

566
01:27:19,171 --> 01:27:20,921
Do you know where he is now?

567
01:27:31,171 --> 01:27:32,255
Do you have a car?

568
01:35:00,421 --> 01:35:02,421
