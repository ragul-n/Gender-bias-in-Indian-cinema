1
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:59,528
Anwar, what are you doing?
Stop it.

2
00:01:59,818 --> 00:02:01,490
Stop that radio.

3
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:10,682
I told you to just stop it, Anwar.

4
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:13,463
The Subedar is going
on leave tomorrow.

5
00:02:13,683 --> 00:02:16,886
It's his sister's wedding.
I thought I'd put on a song

6
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:19,358
and lift your mood.
- Nice.

7
00:02:19,478 --> 00:02:21,446
What can you do, buddy?

8
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,636
I am going home on a holiday.

9
00:02:24,226 --> 00:02:26,619
But there is no excitement
as I used to feel.

10
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:30,732
My family has ruined my mood
by their constant tiffs.

11
00:02:32,016 --> 00:02:33,969
Mother doesn't call.

12
00:02:35,289 --> 00:02:37,216
I wonder what's going on.

13
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:41,975
Nobody understands
an army man's issues.

14
00:02:42,095 --> 00:02:45,124
They don't get it.
He comes and goes.

15
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:47,654
The family doesn't get it.

16
00:02:47,774 --> 00:02:49,439
You're absolutely right, sir.
- Shut up.

17
00:02:50,645 --> 00:02:52,804
Why are you so disappointed,
Jeetu Singh?

18
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:53,978
Can't help it, Commander.

19
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:57,133
You're going for your sister's
wedding. - I don't want to.

20
00:02:57,872 --> 00:02:59,720
Where's Satellite?

21
00:03:00,142 --> 00:03:01,602
Satellite!
- Hey, Satellite!

22
00:03:01,893 --> 00:03:03,133
Satellite.

23
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:05,800
I can hear you, sir.

24
00:03:06,346 --> 00:03:08,818
I'll get the job done.
- He's here.

25
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,533
All set! No tension.

26
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:57,462
All ready?
- Yes.

27
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,198
Welcome to 42nd Company Lotus

28
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,764
and all my army brothers.

29
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:12,238
Clap for me, guys.

30
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,940
Where can I take you all today?

31
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,157
You tell us, where are we going?

32
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:21,072
To our officer's lovely
village...

33
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:25,995
Wagah.
- Correct.

34
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:29,620
Wagah! Where to?
- Wagah!

35
00:04:34,093 --> 00:04:35,941
Do you see that?

36
00:04:36,996 --> 00:04:40,208
Sugarcane fields
and that's not all.

37
00:04:41,149 --> 00:04:45,561
Sugarcane fields spread
in miles. Can you see?

38
00:05:06,975 --> 00:05:09,183
How do you find these fields?

39
00:05:10,063 --> 00:05:12,157
Very nice.
- These are the fields in which

40
00:05:12,746 --> 00:05:16,133
the officer ran to prepare
to get into the army.

41
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:18,322
So right.
- Hey, you.

42
00:05:26,315 --> 00:05:30,282
The most beautiful house in Wagah
is decked like a bride today.

43
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:34,534
All the joy in the world
is in that house.

44
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:38,064
There is a wedding in the offing.
Something must happen.

45
00:05:38,568 --> 00:05:41,436
Do you hear the drums play?

46
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:45,642
Introduce us to your family now.

47
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,580
Let's go, boys!

48
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:53,188
Greetings!

49
00:05:53,308 --> 00:05:56,171
Greetings!

50
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,890
Here you are, my friend.

51
00:05:59,171 --> 00:06:01,538
Sister-in-law!

52
00:06:01,658 --> 00:06:04,846
She is the best!
My sister-in-law.

53
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,357
She is the mastermind
in this house.

54
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:13,049
She is the one
who married my brother.

55
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:18,250
And this one is
your sister-in-law.

56
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:21,575
She is my wife.

57
00:06:23,082 --> 00:06:26,794
Sir, let's have a bout.

58
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:30,868
Okay, boy, let's go.

59
00:06:30,988 --> 00:06:32,997
So happy!

60
00:06:34,216 --> 00:06:37,753
Whoa!

61
00:06:39,257 --> 00:06:42,838
Come on!
- You're good.

62
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:47,057
Look at this one!

63
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:50,101
What are you looking at?

64
00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:53,172
You look gorgeous.

65
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,237
Let me not jinx you. You were
so young, now you'll leave.

66
00:06:59,055 --> 00:07:02,398
Greetings!
- Greetings.

67
00:07:02,793 --> 00:07:05,406
This is so good!

68
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:08,445
Where is she?

69
00:07:09,678 --> 00:07:13,030
Here she is!
How are you?

70
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:18,115
How are you, grandma?

71
00:07:23,374 --> 00:07:25,873
Give me more.

72
00:09:34,017 --> 00:09:37,361
Alpha seeking 112.
Commander, Lotus Post.

73
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,613
Over! Alpha seeking 112.

74
00:09:39,733 --> 00:09:42,570
Alpha seeking 112.
Commander Lotus Post. Over!

75
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:47,515
Commander Lotus post
online, sir. - Commander.

76
00:09:47,635 --> 00:09:49,598
In light of growing enemy
aggression in the valley,

77
00:09:49,678 --> 00:09:52,997
all the pre-approved leaves stand
cancelled until further review.

78
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,932
Sir, I have sent 3 leave
applications from my company.

79
00:09:59,486 --> 00:10:02,609
If you could only consider
Subedar Jeetu Singh,

80
00:10:02,917 --> 00:10:05,002
it would be good, sir.
Over.

81
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:07,075
It's the army, Commander. Sorry.

82
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:10,119
And there's a definite info of
aggression on Lotus post tonight.

83
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:12,134
So, deploy men accordingly. Over!

84
00:10:12,254 --> 00:10:15,139
Lotus, 185, noted, sir.
- Over and out.

85
00:10:18,382 --> 00:10:21,663
We hammer away all year long.

86
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:26,572
You could have stayed out!
My sister's wedding is 2 days away.

87
00:10:27,474 --> 00:10:30,404
Why did you have to do this?

88
00:10:32,199 --> 00:10:34,996
Sir, this isn't happening.

89
00:10:35,423 --> 00:10:38,529
Let's burn them down.

90
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,551
Be careful!

91
00:10:45,465 --> 00:10:49,372
Lotus 185 has to patrol
more. We will stay on posts.

92
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,093
I can't leave more than
2 riflemen at 74.

93
00:10:53,213 --> 00:10:54,578
Anwar.
- Yes, sir.

94
00:10:54,698 --> 00:10:55,968
Shankar.
- Yes, sir.

95
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,455
Can you manage this?
- Yes, sir.

96
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:01,443
It's a nearby post. It'll take
about 5 hours. - Don't worry, sir.

97
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,783
We will punch them
if they do any mischief.

98
00:11:05,549 --> 00:11:07,150
Tiger 42.

99
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,062
Let's go.
- Yes!

100
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:44,906
The captain said, there were
3 leave applications from our unit.

101
00:11:45,214 --> 00:11:48,988
One was Jeetu sir,
one was me, who was the third?

102
00:11:50,356 --> 00:11:52,564
Me.
- You?

103
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:55,793
Yes. Why do you need leave?

104
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,878
I don't have a wife.

105
00:11:59,026 --> 00:12:02,492
But I do have a mother.
- A mother handles every brother!

106
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:06,266
Right, you're missing
your wife.

107
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,007
My brother miss me more
than she misses me.

108
00:12:09,127 --> 00:12:11,602
There's no one here. Listen...
- Here, it's on.

109
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,077
There's no movement to be
seen on the other side.

110
00:12:15,745 --> 00:12:18,964
I think, either this post
of theirs is vacant

111
00:12:19,298 --> 00:12:20,719
or the boys are good for nothing.

112
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:25,950
Yes, sir. I'll check
and update you.

113
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:29,733
Keep a back-up ready.
If my guess is right,

114
00:12:30,173 --> 00:12:33,797
our flag will be waved at their
post at the crack of dawn.

115
00:12:40,543 --> 00:12:42,664
They are up to no good.

116
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:50,255
Let's watch out. Go ahead.

117
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:54,988
Hey, you fools!

118
00:12:55,235 --> 00:12:58,305
You didn't let me even eat.
You started as soon as I came.

119
00:12:58,425 --> 00:13:01,976
No, friend. They might be
in a hurry to go to Allah.

120
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:06,367
No, it seems they are too hungry.

121
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:09,666
Come on, everyone.

122
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:14,079
Careful, Sajan.

123
00:13:19,729 --> 00:13:23,803
Watch out!

124
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,241
What's that?

125
00:13:40,165 --> 00:13:43,015
"Satellite."

126
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:48,139
What the heck?

127
00:13:51,438 --> 00:13:54,685
Oh, God!

128
00:13:56,956 --> 00:14:00,106
The one who speaks
His name is blessed.

129
00:14:14,122 --> 00:14:16,199
Wait.

130
00:14:43,472 --> 00:14:45,310
Are you okay?

131
00:14:48,658 --> 00:14:53,013
Sir, at 114, there was firing
from both the sides.

132
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,866
We killed about seven to eight
soldiers of theirs.

133
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,706
But`I regret to inform,
we lost 4 men too.

134
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,964
You told me that the post was
vacant. - I was wrong, sir.

135
00:15:05,084 --> 00:15:07,290
We were 14 and they were
a minimum of 30,

136
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,722
But if we count the corpses,

137
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:11,660
the victory is ours.
- Jackpot!

138
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,739
Keep achieving such feats.
Good job!

139
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,158
Let's get to work.
Just keep me updated. Thank you.

140
00:15:24,937 --> 00:15:26,512
Jai Hind, sir.

141
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,415
Anwar got hit by a bullet.

142
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,882
Shankar has got some
injuries on the lower end. - Oh!

143
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:36,137
At ease.

144
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:40,613
Well done, my boys. You have
made not only your battalion

145
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:44,211
but also the armed forces so
very proud. -Thank you, sir.

146
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:47,515
How are you, Anwar?
How are you doing? - Fine, sir.

147
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:51,826
Sir, the bullet hit me on the
rebound. Not much damage.

148
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:54,338
I was merely assisting.

149
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:56,475
Satellite Shankar
did it all.

150
00:15:56,595 --> 00:15:58,877
I heard.
- Sir.

151
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,052
How are you doing, naughty
boy? - Very fit, sir. Thanks.

152
00:16:03,826 --> 00:16:06,967
Tell me someting, which satellite

153
00:16:07,173 --> 00:16:10,446
lets you catch all kinds of
languages? - I don't, sir.

154
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:13,763
I catch on to the feelings.

155
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:17,493
The correct feelings
make you ignore the language.

156
00:16:17,613 --> 00:16:21,109
If you ask anyone in Rajputana
about the KPG rifle group

157
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,484
they will tell you how
great a cook he was.

158
00:16:23,712 --> 00:16:26,915
A Tamilian who could cook Pan
Indian food better than the natives.

159
00:16:27,548 --> 00:16:29,422
He was my dad.
- Okay.

160
00:16:29,542 --> 00:16:31,851
He was under the command
of Sardar Gurubaksh Singh.

161
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:34,851
He was such a fan, he married
his daughter to him.

162
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:37,016
Oh!
- The Punjabi lady is my mom.

163
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:40,425
He was in Nagaland
when I was born and then

164
00:16:40,545 --> 00:16:43,557
the north, the south, east,
west. I grew up all over India.

165
00:16:43,677 --> 00:16:46,909
So my country is in my blood
since childhood.

166
00:16:47,197 --> 00:16:49,731
So proud to have you
boys in my battalion.

167
00:16:49,851 --> 00:16:52,475
By the way, the doctor
recommends 8 days of rest.

168
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:55,062
8 days? I don't want it.

169
00:16:55,471 --> 00:16:58,753
I am hurt, but I'm fit.
See?

170
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:00,301
Shankar.
- Yes.

171
00:17:00,697 --> 00:17:02,826
Shankar.
- Take it easy. - Sir.

172
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:05,078
Sir, I'm fit.
- Sit.

173
00:17:05,198 --> 00:17:06,619
Sit.

174
00:17:07,244 --> 00:17:10,578
I need men, but I won't drag
my injured soldiers to battle.

175
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:14,159
Rest here for 8 days. I will meet
you at the base, Monday morning.

176
00:17:16,844 --> 00:17:21,278
Sir. A request, sir.
- Yes.

177
00:17:23,297 --> 00:17:26,728
Sir, I want to go home.
I just have to rest.

178
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:29,772
I can do it here
or on a train seat.

179
00:17:30,463 --> 00:17:33,322
I must do something important
at home. - Where's home?

180
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:36,586
Right here. Pollachi.
- It's Tamil Nadu-Kerala border.

181
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,666
It will take 3 days to get there.
- 3 to go, 3 to return.

182
00:17:40,113 --> 00:17:44,239
It's half a day's work. I will be
back on the 8th day, and the base.

183
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,256
What is so important
you must go for half a day?

184
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:51,167
My mom lives alone.
So the fact is

185
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:53,736
she watches TV all day.

186
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:57,554
So, she has a film on her eyes.
- Cataract.

187
00:17:57,758 --> 00:18:00,291
Yes, sir. The doctor said
she needs surgery.

188
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,024
I promised to get it done
in the next holiday. If I don't...

189
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,822
She may go blind.
- Sit, Shankar.

190
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:13,879
Other soldiers have people
at home, who are sick.

191
00:18:13,999 --> 00:18:18,022
They have marriages, kids'
being born. I canceled all leaves.

192
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:21,414
No, you said, 8 days, so...

193
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,833
I thought of it.
As you wish.

194
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,774
I understand.
As you wish, sir.

195
00:18:28,356 --> 00:18:30,239
It's up to you.

196
00:18:39,382 --> 00:18:42,585
Rifleman KPJ Shankar.
- Sir.

197
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:46,227
I want you in action at base
next Monday, 29th morning.

198
00:18:46,347 --> 00:18:48,857
Yes, sir.
- I want a soldier's promise.

199
00:18:48,977 --> 00:18:52,424
Sir, I will be at base on Monday
the 29th. Soldier's promise.

200
00:18:52,544 --> 00:18:54,368
Are you sure?
- Yes.

201
00:18:54,615 --> 00:18:56,928
Take your travel pass
from my office.

202
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:00,773
All the best.

203
00:19:03,199 --> 00:19:06,358
Hey!
- I got it.

204
00:19:12,473 --> 00:19:16,881
Okay, buddy. It's the same
thing, which of us goes.

205
00:19:18,512 --> 00:19:21,970
I am glad, someone's going
to be at my sister's wedding.

206
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:25,718
I won't go, my gifts
will get there.

207
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,104
Gifts?
- You're going, right? Take this.

208
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,177
I put in Kartar's number.
Call him when you get on the train.

209
00:19:34,297 --> 00:19:36,517
Okay. - He will come for you
at Ludhiana.

210
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:39,032
Okay.
- Hold this.

211
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:41,317
It's a Pashmina shawl
from Srinagar.

212
00:19:41,437 --> 00:19:44,317
Okay? It's not got a name on it.
Tell her to choose one she likes.

213
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:49,547
This sari is for Chani.

214
00:19:52,974 --> 00:19:56,378
A rum bottle for my big
brother. Take it.

215
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:59,229
Watch it.

216
00:19:59,946 --> 00:20:03,298
Put it in.
- Shankar.

217
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,729
A token for Mahesh Mane's
child.

218
00:20:06,849 --> 00:20:09,060
It's been here for 6 months.
Take it.

219
00:20:09,413 --> 00:20:11,014
Call Major Deshmukh
at Chandrapur

220
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:12,887
station. He'll get
you to Maheshgarh.

221
00:20:13,007 --> 00:20:14,455
Okay.

222
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:19,319
Get my papers from your locker.
- Yes.

223
00:20:19,439 --> 00:20:23,260
I took your numbers.
- Explain the situation.

224
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,880
But don't mention
the bullet.

225
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,732
Shankar!
- Stop it already.

226
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:34,069
I have no space for a shaving
kit. - Mail from your house.

227
00:20:34,663 --> 00:20:38,578
The yellow chit!
The boy's getting married.

228
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,572
Get lost, boy.
- Shankar. Transport is here.

229
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:44,825
Is it here?
- Yes. - Hurry.

230
00:22:16,087 --> 00:22:19,325
Boy, what's your seat number?
- Uncle...

231
00:22:19,744 --> 00:22:23,474
32 is mine. - Impossible.
- There's no problem.

232
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:27,336
You may sit here comfortably.

233
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:02,051
Hello, mom?
- So found time to call me?

234
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:03,564
Are you watching TV?

235
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,846
Don't go after my TV
viewing, okay?

236
00:23:06,966 --> 00:23:08,782
Did you eat?
- Yes.

237
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:11,958
Mom, who all have you given
my base address to? - Why?

238
00:23:12,195 --> 00:23:16,110
Who is P. Thangamani?
It's a reference from aunt.

239
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:19,511
His daughter is learning
nursing in Bangalore.

240
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,995
Your aunt said, their daughter
is ideal for you.

241
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:26,814
I sent the photo on Whatsapp.
Do you like it? - What is that?

242
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:30,509
It's a stamp sized photo.
- They are conservative Tamilians.

243
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:33,717
You're lucky you got
a photo. Your aunt said,

244
00:23:33,837 --> 00:23:36,743
she sent you her digits.
She wants you to speak to her.

245
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:40,086
I won't speak to her.
- Okay, don't say that.

246
00:23:40,206 --> 00:23:44,006
Her pride is at stake. She is
from your aunt's in laws' village.

247
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:47,093
Are you in train?

248
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:50,727
What? No, mom.
What are you saying?

249
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,120
You're coming home!
Shankar.

250
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:57,607
You're coming home, right? - I find
no time to call, how can I come?

251
00:23:58,082 --> 00:24:00,624
Okay, I will call you back later.

252
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:03,777
What did he say?
- Mom...

253
00:24:03,897 --> 00:24:06,953
I think he is coming home.

254
00:24:08,901 --> 00:24:13,063
It's not a mistake.
They got on this train by mistake.

255
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,174
You were on the other train.

256
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:17,893
You got into a train for the South.

257
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:20,464
This goes to Kanyakumari.
- It does?

258
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,542
What can we do?
- The Shalda train is following.

259
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:28,387
It stops at Kathua. Get down
there and take it. That's all.

260
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:35,870
You will have to change the train.
- We've to change. - No problem.

261
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:40,295
How many luggages do you
have? - Two there. - Four.

262
00:24:44,884 --> 00:24:47,110
What will we do?

263
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,167
Where is the Syalda train?
- Platform 2, hurry. It's leaving.

264
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:57,337
There it is. Number two.
- Okay. I got it.

265
00:25:09,865 --> 00:25:12,813
Move. You cannot carry one bag.

266
00:25:12,933 --> 00:25:15,197
And you're trying to carry two.

267
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:17,352
What are you doing?
Hurry, please.

268
00:25:17,709 --> 00:25:20,419
Uncle, walk faster.
- Yes. Come.

269
00:25:26,898 --> 00:25:30,092
Yes.
- Come on, aunt.

270
00:25:57,633 --> 00:26:01,777
Bengalis always help each other.
- No, I'm not one.

271
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:05,208
I speak Bengali well.
I am an Indian.

272
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:07,267
Bye.
- Good.

273
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,720
What happened? Missed the train?

274
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,588
It's okay, take a taxi to Pathankot.

275
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:28,030
You'll reach fast by road.
The train halts at the platform.

276
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:31,119
You'll get it.
Get going.

277
00:26:35,003 --> 00:26:37,282
Rs. 2,000.
- Rs. 2,000?

278
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:40,519
Just to go to Pathankot?
- Take it or leave it. Fixed rate.

279
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,238
Thank you, boss.
- Thank you.

280
00:26:43,629 --> 00:26:46,471
Such random folks.
- Sir, Pathankot.

281
00:26:47,588 --> 00:26:49,726
Is this yours?
- Excuse me.

282
00:26:49,921 --> 00:26:54,003
You're going to Pathankot station?
Let's share a cab.

283
00:26:54,123 --> 00:26:55,437
He's asking for too much.

284
00:26:55,557 --> 00:26:58,956
That's why I said, let's split.
Come on, we'll share.

285
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:02,513
Rs. 500 is too much for a soldier.
I have a long way to go.

286
00:27:02,633 --> 00:27:05,214
Thank you, you go.
I'll manage it. - Okay.

287
00:27:05,797 --> 00:27:08,700
I'll pay, just come with me.

288
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:12,521
All of it?
- Yes, I don't want to go alone.

289
00:27:12,641 --> 00:27:15,688
Do you mind? Let's go.
Come, please.

290
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:21,138
Sir, you take advantage of
people's helplessness

291
00:27:21,258 --> 00:27:23,874
outside the station.
It's bad.

292
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:27,737
I clear things up so
we don't have issues later.

293
00:27:27,857 --> 00:27:32,813
Rs. 2,000 is the rate for
cabs. It will cost Rs. 4,000.

294
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:38,259
Rs. 4,000.
- Yes. - Drop me here.

295
00:27:38,379 --> 00:27:41,023
One moment. Wait.
- He said Rs. 2,000.

296
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:44,850
Will you pay, anyway?
Sit. - No.

297
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:54,853
Get in. I'm back. I had a train
reservation from Kathua, right?

298
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:58,319
But covering the story
took so long, I missed my train.

299
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:02,702
And I am going crazy trying to
catch it from Pathankot station.

300
00:28:02,822 --> 00:28:05,640
I hired a taxi from here.
From here

301
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,295
to Pathankot is only 28 kms.

302
00:28:09,415 --> 00:28:13,650
Listen to this taxi driver
about the fare he's expecting.

303
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,927
Yes, sir, look here. So...
- Yes.

304
00:28:16,047 --> 00:28:19,833
How much do you want to
go to Pathankot? - I told you.

305
00:28:19,953 --> 00:28:23,186
Shut the camera.
- Do you see that attitude?

306
00:28:23,688 --> 00:28:27,576
His name is Ravindra
Singh, JKHCM.

307
00:28:27,696 --> 00:28:31,363
513492. He drives a Dzire.
- Stop!

308
00:28:31,483 --> 00:28:34,600
He is part of the taxi mafia

309
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,807
which stands outside stations
taking advantage of folks. - Ma'am.

310
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:42,378
Shut this, or I'll stop the car.
- What will you do?

311
00:28:42,603 --> 00:28:45,409
Let me see you stop it!
Your license

312
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,972
will get canceled, today.
Or I'm not Meera Bakshi.

313
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:52,685
Come here. - Do you know,
everybody is watching?

314
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:57,831
Any tourists who come now, will
slap you before taking your cab.

315
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,679
Sorry. Pay me what you want.

316
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,599
It's Rs. 21 per km.
How much is that for 28 kms?

317
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,995
Rs. 588. I'll pay Rs. 600.

318
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,268
Okay?
- Okay.

319
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:16,385
I'll be there in some time.

320
00:29:30,505 --> 00:29:32,256
Hello?
- Hello, Pramila?

321
00:29:32,376 --> 00:29:35,362
Yes, who is speaking?
- My name is Shankar KPJ.

322
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,541
My aunt, Ms Kannan gave
me your number. - Oh! Hi.

323
00:29:43,003 --> 00:29:46,962
You can speak in Hindi, right?
- No problem.

324
00:29:47,217 --> 00:29:49,487
Why?
- I am in the college canteen.

325
00:29:49,607 --> 00:29:52,295
The girls gossip about
random things.

326
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,289
What are you studying
in Bangalore? - I'll be back.

327
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:59,046
In Cunnoor. I study microbiology.

328
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,764
Micro? What?
- Microbiology.

329
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:04,425
We study micro organisms.

330
00:30:04,645 --> 00:30:07,144
Unicellular, multicellular,
all of them.

331
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:11,147
Have you heard of Pathology
and all that?

332
00:30:12,438 --> 00:30:16,890
No. Why? - It's a part of micro
biology and it's interesting.

333
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,441
I want to join the college
and start studying.

334
00:30:19,802 --> 00:30:23,403
Okay, it's interesting in
the context of nursing.

335
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:26,577
I got what you said.

336
00:30:27,135 --> 00:30:30,206
It reminded me of
my old friend, Shreedhar.

337
00:30:30,531 --> 00:30:33,364
He says the most
interesting things, like you.

338
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:37,199
Let me have him speak
to you.

339
00:30:37,454 --> 00:30:39,565
You will get along
with him.

340
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:41,822
I don't get what you mean.

341
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:45,288
Speak to Shreedhar once,
you will get it.

342
00:30:46,286 --> 00:30:51,116
Okay, so if my aunt calls,

343
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:56,237
please tell her, I called you.
- Okay, bye.

344
00:30:56,777 --> 00:30:58,845
Thank you.

345
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,337
I'm the national villain, now.
As if I'm robbing the country.

346
00:31:11,457 --> 00:31:13,105
What about those who rob us?

347
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:18,343
RTO, the police, union guys,
local goons.

348
00:31:18,463 --> 00:31:22,417
Nobody scolds them,
but they go after us.

349
00:31:26,157 --> 00:31:29,509
Satellite!
- Friends.

350
00:31:32,294 --> 00:31:37,000
Friends! A taxi driver
from Jammu

351
00:31:37,233 --> 00:31:41,218
Ravinder, if your sister,
daughter

352
00:31:41,447 --> 00:31:45,485
or someone dear to you
were in her place,

353
00:31:46,062 --> 00:31:50,100
would you still want
to rob her?

354
00:31:50,883 --> 00:31:53,575
If this is your country,

355
00:31:54,107 --> 00:31:58,488
the other Indians
are your family, right?

356
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:03,916
Answer me, friends!
Are they your family?

357
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:07,968
Or not?
- Not bad, dude.

358
00:32:09,296 --> 00:32:13,308
That was bad enough.
Why did you have to

359
00:32:13,428 --> 00:32:15,755
treat me to a friend's
speech? - Listen to him.

360
00:32:23,906 --> 00:32:25,867
How much, ma'am?
- No, it's okay.

361
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,829
Are you sure?
- It's okay, don't worry.

362
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:30,161
Okay, I'm Shankar.
- Right. Meera.

363
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,664
Hello, excuse me!
Do you mind? Please?

364
00:32:35,265 --> 00:32:37,834
Which coach are you in?
- S-4 32.

365
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:41,036
You?
- A 116.

366
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:44,383
Where are you going?
- It's on platform 2.

367
00:32:44,774 --> 00:32:47,352
Are you on the Hyderabad train?
- Yes.

368
00:32:47,608 --> 00:32:50,230
Yes. Which one are you on?
- Tamil Nadu.

369
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:53,186
Okay. Okay.

370
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:57,137
Let me drop you.
- Are you sure? Thank you so much!

371
00:32:59,926 --> 00:33:04,079
Thank you so much!
Oh, no! Wait.

372
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:07,758
My tote bag is in that taxi.

373
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:12,500
I'm going to lose my train.
- That's okay. - I'm sorry.

374
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:19,103
Sir, ma'am's bag. Give it
or she'll accuse me of theft.

375
00:33:19,223 --> 00:33:22,340
Go to platform 2.
- Where is that?

376
00:33:25,177 --> 00:33:28,063
Where is number 2, sir?

377
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:32,506
Sir! Thank you!

378
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:36,929
How can someone miss the
same train twice in the same day?

379
00:34:40,383 --> 00:34:44,333
Shame on you, Shankar.

380
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,923
Shankar, I left.

381
00:34:53,125 --> 00:34:57,542
I will get to Phillaur before
you. - No, I missed the train.

382
00:34:59,042 --> 00:35:02,324
What? You missed it?
- Okay, do something for me.

383
00:35:02,444 --> 00:35:05,992
Get to Phillaur and get my bag
from under the seat.

384
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:09,947
It's got my name on it.
It's in S/4 32. - Okay.

385
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:14,310
I'll whatsapp my location. I will
meet you in there. - Okay.

386
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:08,337
'All the joy in the world
will be in this house.'

387
00:37:08,847 --> 00:37:11,460
'A happily joyful house.'

388
00:37:13,034 --> 00:37:16,976
'My family has been ruining
my buzz, by fighting.'

389
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:21,190
'Why doesn't mom call?
What's going on at home?'

390
00:37:28,995 --> 00:37:32,963
I spoke to Arora, who runs
transport all over India.

391
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:35,558
He said, your best option
is Agra.

392
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:39,066
You can get many trains
from there to the south. Okay?

393
00:37:39,788 --> 00:37:41,725
Yes, that's fine, but...

394
00:37:42,855 --> 00:37:45,679
Why is the house so
subdued?

395
00:37:46,053 --> 00:37:50,056
Everyone wanted Jeetu
to arrive.

396
00:37:50,344 --> 00:37:53,828
We are sad
since he's not here.

397
00:37:55,015 --> 00:37:59,731
Where is grandma? Sir
sent a special message for her.

398
00:37:59,851 --> 00:38:03,289
She is unwell.
- Can I meet her?

399
00:38:03,896 --> 00:38:07,072
She hasn't spoken to
sir in a month.

400
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:11,110
Grandma died,
and aunt's wedding is off.

401
00:38:16,165 --> 00:38:20,265
She has been in bed
for 1 month. She used to move.

402
00:38:21,074 --> 00:38:23,159
But now she is comatose.

403
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:26,178
Jeetu would be shattered
to know this.

404
00:38:26,371 --> 00:38:28,571
That's why, we are hiding it.

405
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:32,389
Shankar, I'm Kartar.

406
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:36,012
This is your bag.
- Thank you.

407
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:41,097
Grandma would be fine
if he got here.

408
00:38:41,471 --> 00:38:44,814
She was crazy about him.

409
00:38:45,307 --> 00:38:47,401
Come, I'll show you.

410
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:50,726
Come.

411
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,461
Grandma! Jeetu called.

412
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:58,367
He asked about you.
Jeetu called.

413
00:38:59,533 --> 00:39:02,876
See? The name made
her move.

414
00:39:03,122 --> 00:39:06,456
If she heard his voice,
she'd get up.

415
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:12,707
Bring him here from
the border, so she can live.

416
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:22,703
Is that all? With a satellite

417
00:39:23,213 --> 00:39:25,809
you can be near anyone.
Even Jeetu.

418
00:39:40,573 --> 00:39:44,084
Hello, grandma!

419
00:39:45,262 --> 00:39:49,115
Won't you welcome
the soldier?

420
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:54,200
I came 400 miles
away for you to smile at me.

421
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,682
Smile at me, brother.

422
00:39:58,989 --> 00:40:01,857
This is pure army issue.

423
00:40:02,174 --> 00:40:05,113
We will share it
tonight. What do you think?

424
00:40:06,005 --> 00:40:08,231
Sister-in-law!

425
00:40:08,451 --> 00:40:12,762
Hello! The one who keeps
it all together.

426
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:15,814
Greetings!
- My dear son.

427
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:22,707
Here you are. A Pashmina
shawl for you. - For me?

428
00:40:22,827 --> 00:40:26,754
You can give it to anyone
you want. Okay? - Yes.

429
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:31,071
Hey, is that you?

430
00:40:31,871 --> 00:40:33,551
Little one!

431
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:38,500
I swear you look lovely.

432
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:42,917
My little lioness!
My sweet poppet.

433
00:40:43,845 --> 00:40:46,660
Where did you come
to and where are you going?

434
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:49,326
Jeetu!

435
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:55,683
Are you happy?
I'm here!

436
00:40:56,211 --> 00:41:00,055
I'll make it okay.
See what I got you.

437
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:10,061
Kartar! My dear boy.

438
00:41:10,181 --> 00:41:13,766
Come and hug me.
- Jeetu!

439
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:17,954
Let's arm wrestle.
- I'll defeat you.

440
00:41:18,074 --> 00:41:21,941
Jeetu, I will beat you.
- Come on, get with it.

441
00:41:22,653 --> 00:41:25,222
Let's go for it.

442
00:41:29,129 --> 00:41:33,616
Grandma, I beat Jeetu!

443
00:41:33,736 --> 00:41:37,487
Grandma, I beat Jeetu!

444
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,985
It's motherland!

445
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:46,085
My motherland!

446
00:41:53,995 --> 00:41:57,980
Why are you in bed?
Your daughter is getting married.

447
00:41:58,576 --> 00:42:02,341
What's going on? See what
I got. Take what you want.

448
00:42:02,461 --> 00:42:05,684
Motherland.

449
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:09,414
You will crib
I didn't get anything.

450
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:13,337
I got back home. I've not
spoken to you in a month.

451
00:42:13,663 --> 00:42:17,279
Motherland, I'm hungry
so feed me.

452
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:22,234
Let it go. Give me
some curds.

453
00:42:24,152 --> 00:42:27,715
Motherland!
- My son.

454
00:42:28,793 --> 00:42:31,951
My son.

455
00:42:36,543 --> 00:42:38,866
You're back!

456
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:55,046
Okay, brother.
- It's okay. Take care of her.

457
00:43:20,417 --> 00:43:23,127
Hello?
- Thank you so much!

458
00:43:23,247 --> 00:43:26,620
Why are you so happy?
- I'm set for life.

459
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:29,808
What a hot girl
you introduced me to!

460
00:43:29,928 --> 00:43:33,995
Who are you talking about?
- Pramila! From Cunnoor.

461
00:43:34,305 --> 00:43:38,519
You gave me her number.
If she's set, forget the rest.

462
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:42,778
Are you nuts? Did you
see her photo?

463
00:43:43,072 --> 00:43:46,327
The kind you get in the papers.
Child kidnapper from Madurai.

464
00:43:46,447 --> 00:43:49,969
She looks like that.
- Check out her Instagram.

465
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:51,976
I sent you a link
to her account.

466
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:55,715
I'm sure, everyone looks bad
in a stamp size photo.

467
00:43:55,835 --> 00:43:58,900
If you're not interested
in Pramila, it's okay. Bye.

468
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,705
Bye.
- Hey, listen!

469
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,299
He is a bad compounder.

470
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:09,241
My friend has lost it.

471
00:44:37,032 --> 00:44:42,618
Shankar!

472
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:08,907
Hello, Pramila?
Hi, Shankar here.

473
00:45:09,141 --> 00:45:11,384
What?

474
00:45:12,211 --> 00:45:15,941
Nothing, just calling
about the marriage proposal.

475
00:45:16,061 --> 00:45:18,686
I guess, Shreedhar contacted
you. - Yes.

476
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,999
I can't speak to you.
Sorry. - Sorry?

477
00:45:25,304 --> 00:45:28,076
Pramila?

478
00:45:28,687 --> 00:45:31,088
She hung up.

479
00:45:35,475 --> 00:45:39,214
'The train arriving...'

480
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,414
Don't buzz in.
- Sir, it's 12124.

481
00:45:44,534 --> 00:45:47,600
When will it go?
- Let's move.

482
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,169
What is this?

483
00:45:50,626 --> 00:45:54,761
Why are you crowded here?
Get back!

484
00:45:55,281 --> 00:45:58,290
Quiet. - They're right.
You got into the wrong place.

485
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:03,076
Go there. Tell me something.
Why did you go there to rot?

486
00:46:03,362 --> 00:46:08,183
That's our burden to bear.
You get free groceries.

487
00:46:08,861 --> 00:46:12,468
You get booze
and if you get shot,

488
00:46:12,941 --> 00:46:17,754
you get compensation.
Footwear, abuses, suspension.

489
00:46:17,874 --> 00:46:22,927
That's all for us. This way.
- Where's the train to Pollachi?

490
00:46:23,127 --> 00:46:27,121
Pollachi. Which division of
the railway is that?

491
00:46:29,497 --> 00:46:33,218
That's the issue with the country.
No one focusses on the railway.

492
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:35,371
Everyone here is struggling.

493
00:46:36,506 --> 00:46:40,245
It's in Palakkad division.
- Okay, sir.

494
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:43,958
You can't get a train here.
This is Agra Cantt. - Yes.

495
00:46:44,154 --> 00:46:48,544
You need to go to Agra
Fort. You have 15 minutes.

496
00:46:49,142 --> 00:46:51,183
Is it far from here?

497
00:46:52,485 --> 00:46:55,610
Do you see these tracks?

498
00:46:55,821 --> 00:46:59,613
Follow them and get there
in 5 minutes. It's illegal.

499
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:03,757
Or, it's 5.5 kms.

500
00:47:03,963 --> 00:47:06,893
Praise the Lord.
Let's go. - So, sir...

501
00:47:08,547 --> 00:47:13,420
It's not easy to help everybody
and you are doing it.

502
00:47:14,311 --> 00:47:18,340
The soldiers are beloved
and so are you.

503
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:22,484
They love your railway.
I am a fan of yours!

504
00:47:24,831 --> 00:47:27,250
See you. Jai Hind.

505
00:47:51,081 --> 00:47:55,735
Uncle. Which way to Agra Fort?

506
00:47:57,511 --> 00:48:01,857
Which train do you want?
- To Palakkad. Comes in 15 minutes.

507
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:06,282
Yes, the signal turned green. It's
up. Last train to the south today.

508
00:48:06,402 --> 00:48:11,124
Get on it at once. Yes.
- What happened? An accident?

509
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:14,749
The crossing gate was open.

510
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:18,806
The train went over some cars.
It brought down light poles.

511
00:48:18,926 --> 00:48:20,806
The pieces are all over the place.

512
00:48:20,999 --> 00:48:23,902
Let it go. It happens.
Get on your train.

513
00:48:24,022 --> 00:48:26,787
There it comes. Run.

514
00:48:35,986 --> 00:48:39,611
I'm trying to go near the bus
that collided with the train.

515
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:41,854
No one is coming forward to help.

516
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:45,831
The train got signal and it's gone.

517
00:48:45,951 --> 00:48:50,204
There's lot of smoke here, I have
to see what's going on inside.

518
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:52,729
Oh, my God!

519
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:55,896
Driver is badly injured.

520
00:48:57,097 --> 00:49:02,253
Oh my God! Guys, there are
some 20-25 people here.

521
00:49:02,373 --> 00:49:05,165
Please, if any of you is watching,

522
00:49:05,285 --> 00:49:09,032
please help. There are kids here
as well. - Guys.

523
00:49:09,152 --> 00:49:12,357
Did you see what happened?
- What is it?

524
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:16,555
A bus is hit by a train
and people are stuck inside it.

525
00:49:16,675 --> 00:49:20,514
Looks like, this is a bomb.

526
00:49:23,081 --> 00:49:26,829
Because...
- Help!

527
00:49:31,566 --> 00:49:35,253
It tumbled again!
We need to do something.

528
00:49:35,587 --> 00:49:38,165
The bus is again on the track.
Move! Get aside.

529
00:49:38,285 --> 00:49:41,305
There's short circuit.
- A tain is approaching.

530
00:49:41,425 --> 00:49:44,525
Call and get the train stopped.
- Please! It's ringing.

531
00:49:44,645 --> 00:49:47,155
No one is answering.

532
00:49:47,419 --> 00:49:50,569
Help!
- What's going on there?

533
00:49:50,943 --> 00:49:54,233
My family is in that bus.

534
00:49:54,946 --> 00:49:57,603
I will get him back.
- Promise?

535
00:49:57,955 --> 00:49:59,952
Soldier's promise.

536
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,105
Yes, tell me. - I was in a
lecture, so I disconnected.

537
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:29,722
Anything important?
- Yes, no. I mean...

538
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:34,773
I was too quick.
- You know what it means

539
00:52:34,893 --> 00:52:37,527
to suggest another guy. It means,
you're not interested in me.

540
00:52:38,442 --> 00:52:41,635
Who told you that?
- Never mind.

541
00:52:42,009 --> 00:52:45,845
I understand everything.
- It's not like that.

542
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:51,299
Don't waste your life over a
soldier. Our lives are not secure.

543
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:55,629
I was on leave. I should be
on a train to Pollachi.

544
00:52:55,954 --> 00:52:58,901
But I am in the streets
of UP, Agra. - Why?

545
00:52:59,421 --> 00:53:02,227
I guess, that's army life.

546
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:06,946
Fight and keep fighting. - The
world is a battlefield, Shankar.

547
00:53:07,066 --> 00:53:09,972
There are battles all around.
Which battle are you

548
00:53:10,092 --> 00:53:13,218
involved in, depends on you.
It's that simple.

549
00:53:13,338 --> 00:53:16,519
You're so bright,
sharp and smart.

550
00:53:17,267 --> 00:53:19,713
Why waste your life
over a soldier like me?

551
00:53:20,302 --> 00:53:22,106
Shankar, listen...
- Pramila.

552
00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:27,369
I only have 5 percent battery and
I must make an important call.

553
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:30,422
Thank you for your
nice words.

554
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:48,814
Shankar, Johnny here.
You did so well in Punjab.

555
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:52,905
The Subedar told everyone,
you're a magician.

556
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:55,385
Johnny, let me speak
to Anwar.

557
00:53:55,505 --> 00:53:58,974
I have no battery, I
must talk to him. - Okay.

558
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:02,726
Yes, brother. Where are you?
Did you catch the train?

559
00:54:02,846 --> 00:54:06,966
No train, only pain. I'm in
Agra, leaving for Pollachi.

560
00:54:07,086 --> 00:54:09,992
I have no time for going
to Itarsi. - Really?

561
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:14,164
If you go to Gwalior,
Itarsi is closeby.

562
00:54:14,284 --> 00:54:17,032
Okay, fine. I'll tell the family.
- Sure, you do that.

563
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:21,158
I know you'll think,
I'm preening I'm on leave.

564
00:54:21,962 --> 00:54:25,305
I promised but am breaking my word,
but... - No one said anything.

565
00:54:25,425 --> 00:54:29,668
Just get back on time
or sir will abuse the unit.

566
00:54:29,788 --> 00:54:33,822
I am really very sorry. I missed
2 days, as I was doing chores.

567
00:54:33,942 --> 00:54:36,760
Just go to Pollachi, man.

568
00:54:44,901 --> 00:54:49,792
'Itarsi is close to Gwalior.'
- Now what?

569
00:54:51,395 --> 00:54:54,448
How did the train get a signal
to pass by after the accident?

570
00:54:54,568 --> 00:54:57,461
The railway rescue team
should have been there. - Yes.

571
00:54:57,581 --> 00:55:01,042
People were stuck for an
hour or so.

572
00:55:01,162 --> 00:55:04,399
Tell us, who was the hero
who saved everybody?

573
00:55:05,506 --> 00:55:08,796
Ma'am, every channel is
playing this video!

574
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:12,227
Your video is breaking
the internet right now.

575
00:55:12,347 --> 00:55:16,014
People are asking who saved
you and the others.

576
00:55:16,134 --> 00:55:18,583
Did you see him?

577
00:55:20,092 --> 00:55:24,332
Last thing I remember is falling
on the bus, bringing it down.

578
00:55:29,096 --> 00:55:34,436
I saw him. He was a soldier
and he saved my dad.

579
00:55:34,556 --> 00:55:37,638
I know his name,
it was on his bag.

580
00:55:38,499 --> 00:55:41,394
Satellite Shankar.

581
00:55:48,485 --> 00:55:51,151
He's right. Thank you so much!

582
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:54,151
Can we go live,
right? Okay.

583
00:55:56,092 --> 00:55:58,731
Ready, ma'am.
- Hi, guys.

584
00:55:59,057 --> 00:56:02,611
I am certain all of you want to
know who is this unfortunate

585
00:56:02,731 --> 00:56:04,837
train accident's actual
hero.

586
00:56:05,263 --> 00:56:10,313
Let me be the first to tell you
the real hero of the tragedy

587
00:56:10,823 --> 00:56:13,498
is an Indian soldier
named Satellite Shankar.

588
00:56:13,889 --> 00:56:17,056
Trust me, I have met him
and very good

589
00:56:17,176 --> 00:56:20,109
I promise you I will
have you meet him too.

590
00:56:20,518 --> 00:56:24,161
So, all I ask is you
stay tuned, since this story

591
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:27,706
is far from being over.
- Are you serious?

592
00:56:27,826 --> 00:56:29,965
A guy called Satellite Shankar?

593
00:56:30,326 --> 00:56:34,549
A child said something random
and you announced it. - Come.

594
00:56:36,938 --> 00:56:40,580
It's not the kid.
It's this bag.

595
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:47,069
How did it get back to me?
It was left with me in Pathankot.

596
00:56:50,583 --> 00:56:52,677
He saved all of us.

597
00:56:54,789 --> 00:56:59,029
I don't know where he is
but I will find him.

598
00:57:01,724 --> 00:57:04,055
I am going to return
the favour

599
00:57:04,442 --> 00:57:08,480
by making him the biggest hero
this country has ever seen.

600
00:57:20,635 --> 00:57:22,927
Hero of the Agra tain tragedy

601
00:57:23,155 --> 00:57:25,777
is an Indian soldier
named Satellite Shankar.

602
00:57:26,177 --> 00:57:29,740
You may find this very dramatic
and unrealistic, but...

603
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:33,674
Until I see it, I won't believe it.

604
00:57:33,794 --> 00:57:35,962
She is cooking up stories.
Shankar Satellite, she says!

605
00:57:36,082 --> 00:57:38,815
What is she talking?
Who is this Satellite?

606
00:57:38,935 --> 00:57:41,428
It seems fake to me.
- Is this real?

607
00:57:41,548 --> 00:57:44,042
Let's have a bet.
- Of 100 rupees.

608
00:57:44,162 --> 00:57:46,937
Do you believe in stories
that come on whatsapp?

609
00:57:47,308 --> 00:57:52,094
All this... Do you really believe,
someone of this name can exist?

610
00:59:06,328 --> 00:59:09,486
Uncle, where is the house
of Anwar, the soldier?

611
00:59:09,606 --> 00:59:12,442
That way.
- That way. - Yes.

612
00:59:26,293 --> 00:59:29,935
Satellite Shankar!

613
00:59:30,055 --> 00:59:33,049
Mom, Satellite Shankar is here.

614
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:37,167
It's you!
Come in.

615
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:42,255
How are you? - Anwar said,
you missed the train.

616
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:46,557
Then he said, you're going home.
- I was, but thought I'd meet you.

617
00:59:46,941 --> 00:59:50,689
Let me see my dad
through the satellite phone.- Wait.

618
00:59:50,809 --> 00:59:53,293
Let him sit.
- Please!

619
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:57,560
Don't hassle mom.
- He saw your videos on his mobile.

620
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:01,337
He knows you. Was it easy
to find the house? - Yes.

621
01:00:01,457 --> 01:00:04,812
Mom! Shankar is here
from the unit. - It's okay, son.

622
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:08,630
Satellite Shankar?
Sit. - Yes.

623
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,313
Anwar is calling every day,
lately. - He is at the base.

624
01:00:14,433 --> 01:00:18,061
So, he gets time.
- All well? - Yes, just...

625
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:21,143
He sent some papers.

626
01:00:25,718 --> 01:00:30,099
Papers? What are they for?

627
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:35,904
So, you're Shankar? We went
to the train to meet you.

628
01:00:36,498 --> 01:00:40,958
He called and we thought
he'd given us the slip.

629
01:00:42,612 --> 01:00:45,339
What do you mean?
- What he's done since 2 years.

630
01:00:45,952 --> 01:00:50,245
'I can't get leave.' Why can't he?
Is there war in Kashmir?

631
01:00:51,618 --> 01:00:55,436
He sent papers asking me to
hand it to you or Mr Tahir.

632
01:01:02,038 --> 01:01:03,921
Thank you.

633
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:10,260
What is that about?
- Nothing, the lawyer asked for it.

634
01:01:10,678 --> 01:01:13,555
It's for his signatures.
- He's taking our land.

635
01:01:13,959 --> 01:01:18,455
We have to pay off his debt.
- You better keep quiet.

636
01:01:19,330 --> 01:01:22,656
Your brother brought the scheme
for the farming project.

637
01:01:23,175 --> 01:01:27,072
He may have, but you
both agreed to it.

638
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:30,904
What did Anwar know?
He's at the border.

639
01:01:31,024 --> 01:01:33,367
So what? We aren't
at the custom's house.

640
01:01:33,895 --> 01:01:37,625
The debt of Rs. 500,000 must
be paid off. - Shame on you!

641
01:01:37,992 --> 01:01:42,382
The land is worth Rs. 5 million!
- Stop it.

642
01:01:42,502 --> 01:01:44,898
Be quiet. I am speaking
to them.

643
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:48,528
You are brothers.
If you can't have some shame

644
01:01:48,648 --> 01:01:51,739
at least, fear God.
He is risking his life

645
01:01:51,859 --> 01:01:54,697
for the country.
He has a child.

646
01:01:54,817 --> 01:01:56,858
Where will he go
if anything bad happens?

647
01:01:56,978 --> 01:01:59,577
You're wrong, mother.
- She is right.

648
01:01:59,697 --> 01:02:02,559
Where will our kids go?

649
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:06,122
This is too much.
- Why should we care?

650
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:10,370
Don't you understand...

651
01:02:14,545 --> 01:02:18,046
What are you talking, mom?
- Sir...

652
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:21,486
You said, you're in a hurry.
If you want...

653
01:02:22,379 --> 01:02:26,109
Brother, don't tell him...

654
01:02:27,015 --> 01:02:29,769
You say anything.
- Is it?

655
01:02:36,654 --> 01:02:40,297
What do you mean? I know where the
money can be arranged from. - Sir!

656
01:02:40,534 --> 01:02:42,804
Okay, I forgot to give this.

657
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:47,775
Sorry. Letter from Anwar.
- What is this?

658
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:52,350
What language is it in?
- I wrote it in Tamil.

659
01:02:52,766 --> 01:02:56,250
He told me, and I wrote
it. - Why did you write it?

660
01:02:59,918 --> 01:03:03,262
He told me not to tell.
Let me read it.

661
01:03:03,865 --> 01:03:08,096
Let's hear it. I bet he has
abused us. I know.

662
01:03:11,189 --> 01:03:16,019
'Brothers, greetings. I can't
seem to get leave.'

663
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:18,737
'So, I'm getting this letter
written to you.'

664
01:03:21,576 --> 01:03:26,916
'My mess in charge Joydeep gets
drenched in sweat while eating.'

665
01:03:28,707 --> 01:03:33,291
'Just like you. He had a check
up and it turned out'

666
01:03:33,411 --> 01:03:36,968
'he had high cholesterol.
I am worried about you.'

667
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:40,606
'Please, get your check up
done, as soon as possible.'

668
01:03:41,231 --> 01:03:44,714
'Tahir, dye your hair,
for God's sake.'

669
01:03:44,974 --> 01:03:48,818
'At the base, when I show
our photos, they ask'

670
01:03:49,337 --> 01:03:53,226
'if you are my dad? You've
always been most handsome.'

671
01:03:53,459 --> 01:03:56,547
'So, take care
and be happy, always.'

672
01:03:57,506 --> 01:04:01,122
'Henna said, the land and
money is causing issues at home.'

673
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:07,073
'I don't get why. My brothers
got me new shoes.'

674
01:04:08,067 --> 01:04:11,639
'They covered up
for my mistakes.'

675
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:16,945
'That is worth all the wealth
in the world.'

676
01:04:18,141 --> 01:04:21,273
'I am facing enemies
at the border.'

677
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:24,051
'It's because I trust
in my brothers.'

678
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:28,415
'I got Shankar to write
this letter since last night'

679
01:04:31,796 --> 01:04:36,010
'I took an enemy bullet in the
left shoulder last night.' - God!

680
01:04:38,095 --> 01:04:42,081
'Don't worry. I'll heal
in a week or so.'

681
01:04:43,158 --> 01:04:47,090
'But I wish, it had hit
me in the chest.'

682
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:51,542
'We would have enough money
to tide over the debts.'

683
01:04:54,405 --> 01:04:57,924
'But still, if that is the case,
don't worry.'

684
01:04:59,209 --> 01:05:02,675
'Send my son to
the orphanage at Nagpur.'

685
01:05:06,999 --> 01:05:11,205
'And get Henna married again.'

686
01:05:15,879 --> 01:05:20,480
'I have signed the papers
and sent them. If I live, '

687
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:25,618
'we will meet at home,
God willing.'

688
01:05:27,971 --> 01:05:30,267
'Or in heaven.'

689
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:39,106
I knew he wasn't okay.

690
01:05:39,845 --> 01:05:42,827
God.
- I'll leave, brother. - Wait.

691
01:05:44,987 --> 01:05:48,427
Sit. Sit down.

692
01:06:03,095 --> 01:06:06,975
Will we send him away
before serving him lunch?

693
01:06:07,538 --> 01:06:11,251
I will serve the food.
I will be back in a jiffy.

694
01:06:35,264 --> 01:06:37,868
Don't get worked up.
Well, we will leave now. - Okay.

695
01:06:37,988 --> 01:06:38,975
It will at least take two

696
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,072
to three hours to reach Nagpur.
- Right, brother.

697
01:06:40,152 --> 01:06:43,164
Good-bye, brother.
I will leave now.

698
01:07:15,458 --> 01:07:17,082
Where are we now?
It's almost four hours now.

699
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:20,500
Brother Tahir told
we will reach Nagpur.

700
01:07:22,123 --> 01:07:26,416
The thing is, the Government no
longer collects the octroi. Right?

701
01:07:27,824 --> 01:07:30,340
But there are lot of
octroi collection centers.

702
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:37,981
Who are they?

703
01:07:47,525 --> 01:07:51,334
Stay there itself.
Don't come out.

704
01:07:52,963 --> 01:07:55,523
Go there.

705
01:08:06,012 --> 01:08:10,191
How much money do you have?
- 10,000 bucks. Please adjust.

706
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:15,219
Sir, they take
the longer route from inside.

707
01:08:15,694 --> 01:08:18,184
How many are they?
- Only one person.

708
01:08:18,765 --> 01:08:21,125
He is handing me over 10,000 bucks.
Shut up. - Send them up.

709
01:08:21,286 --> 01:08:24,769
The rest of them will
automatically come down.

710
01:08:25,007 --> 01:08:25,924
Please have a word with

711
01:08:25,949 --> 01:08:27,741
someone in the police station.
- Look back.

712
01:08:27,837 --> 01:08:30,945
Just look back, that's it.

713
01:08:33,775 --> 01:08:36,855
Mister, let me go.
- Okay, siir.

714
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,461
Mister, please take the money.

715
01:08:51,324 --> 01:08:55,055
Don't hit him. Wait!
Wait, mister. - Hold on.

716
01:08:55,175 --> 01:08:57,799
Why are you hitting him? Wait.
- Why the hell you are interfering?

717
01:08:57,919 --> 01:08:59,775
Why are you hitting him?
- You ask me that?

718
01:08:59,895 --> 01:09:03,567
We will hack you to pieces!
- What is it?

719
01:09:03,805 --> 01:09:08,309
Please stop them.
Look, don't hit him.

720
01:09:08,429 --> 01:09:09,941
We will go to the
police station if he is

721
01:09:09,966 --> 01:09:11,686
at fault.
We will have a word with the cops.

722
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:14,499
Who the hell are you!
- I am a soldier.

723
01:09:14,619 --> 01:09:16,563
Go to the border if
you are a soldier

724
01:09:16,603 --> 01:09:18,378
what the hell are
you doing here?

725
01:09:18,498 --> 01:09:19,817
Don't interfere in
the civil matters.

726
01:09:19,842 --> 01:09:21,870
We will hack you to pieces.
- They are hitting an Indian guy.

727
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:25,964
And you people are just watching?
- He's trying to become a hero.

728
01:09:27,042 --> 01:09:30,587
Let him do what he wants.
But don't help him.

729
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:34,960
Are you sure, sir?
- I am dead sure. - Okay.

730
01:09:35,263 --> 01:09:37,498
Alright, sir.
- Take out the stuff!

731
01:09:37,618 --> 01:09:40,577
Give me the chopper.
And also your camera.

732
01:09:40,697 --> 01:09:44,017
Come on, out with the chopper!

733
01:09:52,152 --> 01:09:54,061
How are you, friend?

734
01:10:20,599 --> 01:10:22,983
Are you sure? I shouldn't help him.
- I am dead sure.

735
01:10:23,103 --> 01:10:25,948
I am very much sure.

736
01:10:26,068 --> 01:10:29,917
Your men started licking the
dust the moment he hit them. - What!

737
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:36,207
He has broke open the
skull of your one more men.

738
01:10:36,673 --> 01:10:39,436
But what are you doing there?
Go and stop all this.

739
01:10:49,628 --> 01:10:52,637
Are you sure?
- I am dead sure! Go and stop him!

740
01:11:22,763 --> 01:11:27,004
Come on, move! Enough.

741
01:11:27,505 --> 01:11:30,118
Enough of your antics.
Arrest him first.

742
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,196
Send them away to the hospital.

743
01:11:32,221 --> 01:11:34,042
They got beaten up for no reason.

744
01:11:34,220 --> 01:11:37,027
Arrest him. Take care of the rest.

745
01:11:37,147 --> 01:11:38,971
Call the ambulance quickly.

746
01:11:40,018 --> 01:11:42,112
You were right.

747
01:11:42,419 --> 01:11:45,920
About the reservation in S4-32.
- What? - 42.

748
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:49,052
It was booked in the name of
KPJ Shankar.

749
01:11:49,272 --> 01:11:51,542
Where's my phone? Can I use yours?

750
01:11:51,662 --> 01:11:53,399
I swear to God!
Doctor Kaushik...

751
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:54,935
I will not share

752
01:11:55,055 --> 01:11:57,988
any classified information
about the battalion on my blog.

753
01:12:03,329 --> 01:12:05,264
Take him in.
- Come on, macho-man.

754
01:12:05,384 --> 01:12:07,877
Take him inside.

755
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:14,992
Make him sit here.

756
01:12:41,979 --> 01:12:45,665
Sir, please call the officer.
- Wait.

757
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:49,826
I don't have much time.
Call him, I have to leave.

758
01:12:53,808 --> 01:12:57,794
Hello? Yes?- Good evening,
I'm Mira Bakshi. I guess, Lt Colonel

759
01:12:57,987 --> 01:13:00,516
Dr Kaushik might've put in a word
for me. - Yes, ma'am.

760
01:13:00,636 --> 01:13:03,384
How can I help you?- Can you
please connect me to someone from

761
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,470
the 42 Rashtriya rifles, please?

762
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:09,060
And the man I'm looking for
is KPJ Shankar.

763
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:11,866
Here's a person from his unit.
I hope he may help you, ma'am.

764
01:13:11,986 --> 01:13:14,004
Oh, wow! That's great, okay.

765
01:13:15,012 --> 01:13:17,055
Hello?-Hi, good evening, sir.
My name

766
01:13:17,095 --> 01:13:19,288
name is Mira Bakshi
from 1 MB of Truth.

767
01:13:19,408 --> 01:13:23,436
Mr Shankar has gone home.
- I know that.

768
01:13:23,556 --> 01:13:27,298
We both missed the train
at Kathua station.

769
01:13:27,718 --> 01:13:31,062
And he had met me again in Agra.

770
01:13:31,845 --> 01:13:35,671
He was there in Moshi
today in Mr Anwar's house.

771
01:13:35,791 --> 01:13:38,577
And Anwar was in the hospital
and he cried inconsolably

772
01:13:38,697 --> 01:13:41,727
when his brother called up.

773
01:13:42,299 --> 01:13:45,598
I was there with him.
- Well, okay. That's great.

774
01:13:45,718 --> 01:13:48,396
You seem to be
an interesting person.

775
01:13:49,232 --> 01:13:52,355
Can you tell something
about Shankar?

776
01:13:52,475 --> 01:13:55,317
Should I tell you in detail
or in short?

777
01:13:55,546 --> 01:13:59,469
Let me know in detail. Get the car.
- Yes, sir.

778
01:14:06,836 --> 01:14:09,950
We will have a word in the morning,
not now. - Please, sir...

779
01:14:34,948 --> 01:14:38,520
Sir...
- Serve him food.

780
01:15:11,485 --> 01:15:15,602
Sir, he harassed us all night.

781
01:15:15,722 --> 01:15:18,137
He said, he has to leave quickly.
Call the military police.

782
01:15:18,257 --> 01:15:21,603
Call him from Mahadik. He said,
please charge my cell-phone.

783
01:15:21,723 --> 01:15:23,451
Send him. Let me deal with him.

784
01:15:27,877 --> 01:15:32,100
Tell me something, are you a
soldier, gangster? Who are you?

785
01:15:32,923 --> 01:15:35,219
You fought yesterday
in the civil area.

786
01:15:35,339 --> 01:15:37,141
According to the norms,
you should have

787
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,063
called up the military guys the
moment you got me here. - Correct.

788
01:15:39,143 --> 01:15:43,199
Norms? I know about the norms.

789
01:15:44,224 --> 01:15:47,796
But before I call the military
police, I would like to confirm.

790
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:51,336
Under what charges
should I book you?

791
01:15:51,456 --> 01:15:54,107
The guys whom you thrashed
are in the hospital.

792
01:15:54,213 --> 01:15:56,667
Should I charge you under
the attempt to murder?

793
01:15:57,144 --> 01:15:59,053
If someone of those die...

794
01:15:59,787 --> 01:16:01,811
Should I book you
under section 302?

795
01:16:01,851 --> 01:16:03,860
Or should I convert
it into murder?

796
01:16:04,506 --> 01:16:06,767
None of them will die, sir.

797
01:16:07,752 --> 01:16:10,787
Are you sure? How come?

798
01:16:14,442 --> 01:16:16,632
Because I have thrashed them.

799
01:16:17,459 --> 01:16:20,151
I kill my enemy.

800
01:16:21,225 --> 01:16:23,670
But they weren't my enemy.

801
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:26,410
They didn't mend their ways,
that's why I thrashed them.

802
01:16:27,799 --> 01:16:29,743
They will not die.

803
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,666
What are you saying, sir?
Even I am not your enemy.

804
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:42,410
Shedge, what name did
sir mention?

805
01:16:42,691 --> 01:16:45,770
Mahadik. - Inform him to meet me.
And charge his cell-phone.

806
01:16:46,052 --> 01:16:47,612
You can go, sir.
Charge your cell-phone.

807
01:16:47,707 --> 01:16:49,489
I will call up at the hospital.

808
01:16:49,585 --> 01:16:52,641
Everything will be cleared.
You can leave, sir.

809
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:58,237
Sir, where have you reached?
- I have reached Nagpur.

810
01:16:58,435 --> 01:17:01,206
I am coming along
with the media guys.

811
01:17:01,523 --> 01:17:05,350
I hope the soldier is still there?
- Do quickly whatever you want to.

812
01:17:05,601 --> 01:17:07,644
He told me that he
will call up his headquarters.

813
01:17:07,669 --> 01:17:10,165
If the army reaches before you,

814
01:17:10,261 --> 01:17:13,229
we will land into a problem.
- Stop joking.

815
01:17:13,349 --> 01:17:15,815
Let's go.
- I am coming.

816
01:17:21,114 --> 01:17:23,436
Grandma, how come you are here?

817
01:17:25,892 --> 01:17:30,036
Tell me what happened.
Didn't you call me here?

818
01:17:30,828 --> 01:17:34,769
I called you? I would have come
to your place had I some work.

819
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:38,935
Shedge, who called her here?

820
01:17:39,374 --> 01:17:41,116
He called her here.

821
01:17:42,410 --> 01:17:44,328
Mister...

822
01:17:50,139 --> 01:17:53,870
You were telling me about
them, the Mahadik family?

823
01:17:56,027 --> 01:18:00,752
Are you from Mr Mahesh Mahadik's
family? - He was my son.

824
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:02,599
Oh?

825
01:18:03,584 --> 01:18:06,514
I am Lieutenant Shankar,
from Mr Mahesh's unit.

826
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:10,451
I am blessed I got to meet you.
- You are Satellite?

827
01:18:11,131 --> 01:18:14,456
How are you, sister-in-law?
- I am fine. - Hold on.

828
01:18:18,237 --> 01:18:21,536
We had a terrific celebration
at the base when she was born.

829
01:18:21,967 --> 01:18:25,460
Brother was leaving, so all had
collected the token money for her.

830
01:18:27,874 --> 01:18:31,534
But Mahesh's body was wrapped in
the tricolor when he came home.

831
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:35,158
He had gone to Shirdi
to pray for a baby girl.

832
01:18:36,821 --> 01:18:39,082
But when his daughter was born...

833
01:18:39,786 --> 01:18:41,835
He passed away.

834
01:18:43,146 --> 01:18:44,908
You are uncle Satellite, right?

835
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:47,424
Can I meet my father
via your satellite?

836
01:18:47,673 --> 01:18:49,028
Sure, hold on.

837
01:18:50,305 --> 01:18:53,172
Why didn't you come home when
you came here from far away?

838
01:18:53,197 --> 01:18:54,605
Why did you call me here?

839
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:58,281
Mom, I had left for my home
that's in Pollachi.

840
01:18:58,518 --> 01:19:01,501
I didn't get a leave.
I was off-duty for eight days.

841
01:19:03,019 --> 01:19:07,620
Six days passed here and there.
But no problem, I met you after all.

842
01:19:08,262 --> 01:19:11,869
That's more than enough for me.
The moment...

843
01:19:12,387 --> 01:19:15,598
If sir leaves me I will board
a train to return to the base.

844
01:19:16,584 --> 01:19:20,983
What do you mean?
You have detained him? - Yes...

845
01:19:21,339 --> 01:19:25,219
No. We haven't detained
him actually.

846
01:19:26,125 --> 01:19:28,377
There was a mess up.

847
01:19:28,579 --> 01:19:31,219
Do you know
they don't get a leave?

848
01:19:31,483 --> 01:19:33,840
They don't come home for a year.

849
01:19:34,604 --> 01:19:37,059
Their wives yearn to have
a glimpse of them, and

850
01:19:37,179 --> 01:19:39,053
mothers yearn to feed them.

851
01:19:40,569 --> 01:19:42,849
And how dare you stop
a soldier from going home!

852
01:19:43,792 --> 01:19:45,152
He isn't the only one responsible.

853
01:19:45,479 --> 01:19:48,620
There are some other reasons
too, my holidays just passed by.

854
01:19:49,051 --> 01:19:52,315
When did you go home last?
- It has been more than a year.

855
01:19:52,632 --> 01:19:55,403
Have you ever thought of your mom?

856
01:19:56,492 --> 01:19:59,936
I want to report on Monday to
the base. And if I don't go...

857
01:20:00,208 --> 01:20:01,713
Will there be an earthquake?

858
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:11,013
Mahesh said,
he will come day after tomorrow.

859
01:20:12,210 --> 01:20:15,139
He disconnected the call after that.

860
01:20:15,681 --> 01:20:19,068
He was a soldier after all.
He kept his promise.

861
01:20:21,105 --> 01:20:23,814
He returned that very day.

862
01:20:24,571 --> 01:20:28,785
But he was lying in the coffin.

863
01:20:29,485 --> 01:20:33,593
Mother... - He had promised me,
but didn't keep his promise.

864
01:20:39,985 --> 01:20:41,872
Promise me.
You have come so far away,

865
01:20:41,897 --> 01:20:43,739
you won't return without
meeting your mother.

866
01:20:44,023 --> 01:20:47,709
Promise me!
- Alright. - Promise me first.

867
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:51,274
Promise me!

868
01:20:56,144 --> 01:21:00,463
Sit down, mother.
Get water for her.

869
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:03,842
Please....

870
01:21:11,254 --> 01:21:14,140
You wish to see your father?

871
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,778
These people who are wearing a
uniform for the sake of the country,

872
01:21:20,498 --> 01:21:21,906
all of them are your fathers.

873
01:21:36,731 --> 01:21:39,388
Sir, please...

874
01:21:40,761 --> 01:21:43,928
Sonawade, get the vehicle.

875
01:21:45,801 --> 01:21:49,514
Drop sir to the railway station.
Okay? - Yes, sir.

876
01:21:57,190 --> 01:22:00,330
Shankar, please meet your family.

877
01:22:01,597 --> 01:22:04,624
I'm sorry, I wasted your time.

878
01:22:05,063 --> 01:22:07,676
No problem, sir.
- Sir...

879
01:22:08,167 --> 01:22:11,510
Your cellphone is charged. Sir!

880
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:20,497
Listen, we'll be there
in five minutes.

881
01:22:20,752 --> 01:22:23,744
Keep some refreshments ready.
- Sir...

882
01:22:23,864 --> 01:22:27,907
You listen to me. Don't even
come here by mistake.

883
01:22:28,126 --> 01:22:32,516
If you come, I don't know
what charges I will force on you.

884
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:37,041
I'll see you soon once I make
your file and dig into details.

885
01:22:37,244 --> 01:22:40,534
Hang up, now.
- Stop the car.

886
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:42,786
Stop it, I say.

887
01:22:42,906 --> 01:22:45,152
Pull over the car. Stop it.

888
01:22:46,287 --> 01:22:48,275
Stop!

889
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:56,480
If Mr Shankar, the one
you call as Satellite...

890
01:22:56,600 --> 01:23:00,026
Hadn't he dared, I would've
been cut into pieces, madam.

891
01:23:00,146 --> 01:23:02,507
Thank you, Bablu.

892
01:23:03,683 --> 01:23:08,452
Everybody who thinks Satellite
Shankar does not exist,

893
01:23:08,865 --> 01:23:13,100
and that I invented this character
to increase my followers,

894
01:23:13,346 --> 01:23:17,022
I have a request for you all.
Come to Maharashtra

895
01:23:17,142 --> 01:23:19,732
and meet Mr Bablu
in the Government hospital.

896
01:23:20,057 --> 01:23:23,189
And for the rest of you,
please stay with me. Very soon,

897
01:23:23,309 --> 01:23:25,213
I'm going to introduce him
to you. In fact, I'm

898
01:23:25,451 --> 01:23:27,219
an arm length away from him.

899
01:23:27,413 --> 01:23:30,759
I'm so excited. I'll see you.

900
01:23:38,575 --> 01:23:40,634
Hello. - I tried to reach you
on phone so many times,

901
01:23:40,714 --> 01:23:42,714
you could've answered
at least once. - Any problem?

902
01:23:43,067 --> 01:23:44,861
No. All okay.

903
01:23:50,043 --> 01:23:53,730
Did you think I'm an useless girl?

904
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,751
You switched off your phone
since two days.

905
01:23:55,989 --> 01:23:58,699
What's my mistake? Tell me at least.

906
01:24:00,293 --> 01:24:02,527
Tell me what did I do.
- Hey...

907
01:24:02,747 --> 01:24:04,876
My phone battery was dead.
I just turned it on.

908
01:24:05,366 --> 01:24:07,147
What has happened?
- Look, Shankar.

909
01:24:07,692 --> 01:24:10,156
I can tolerate anything in life,
but not lies.

910
01:24:10,434 --> 01:24:13,821
If you didn't like me, just say it.
Why judge my character?

911
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:21,145
Listen, I didn't lie to you.
What are you saying?

912
01:24:22,346 --> 01:24:24,905
Didn't you tell me
to find another suitable guy

913
01:24:25,099 --> 01:24:26,973
and not waste my life
with a soldier?

914
01:24:27,093 --> 01:24:29,859
Why did you say that?
Do I seem like an idiot to you?

915
01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:33,277
Don't I understand
the value of a soldier?

916
01:24:33,397 --> 01:24:35,714
Did you think
I was a selfish person?

917
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:40,579
I'm already worked up as I had only
eight days leave to visit home.

918
01:24:40,807 --> 01:24:42,767
Forget home, I am nowhere
close to home right now.

919
01:24:43,354 --> 01:24:46,252
I've promised my CO, I'll report
at the base on Monday morning.

920
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:47,479
I don't know what to do now.

921
01:24:47,559 --> 01:24:51,025
I also promised a colleague's mom
that I will definitely meet my mom.

922
01:24:51,305 --> 01:24:53,812
I must meet her
as I have promised someone.

923
01:24:54,058 --> 01:24:57,305
I really don't know what I say
or talk when I'm worked up.

924
01:24:57,661 --> 01:25:00,718
If I have hurt you in any way,
I'm very sorry.

925
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:04,052
Why didn't you tell me this?
- What are you talking about?

926
01:25:04,172 --> 01:25:07,914
That you have to reach Kashmir on
Monday morning. Where are you now?

927
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:11,279
Yes, this is Kalaburgi.

928
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:16,901
You take National Highway 44 and
you'll reach Salem early morning.

929
01:25:17,021 --> 01:25:20,554
Salem? - Yes, you reach there
and I'll see you.

930
01:25:21,029 --> 01:25:24,161
You'll reach your base on Monday
morning. This is my promise.

931
01:25:24,693 --> 01:25:29,403
I know you're joking. Aren't you?
- Not at all.

932
01:25:29,523 --> 01:25:33,050
Neither should you joke like this
because it is very hurtful.

933
01:25:40,332 --> 01:25:43,578
What is it? Why are you following
me? - You speak Hindi so well.

934
01:25:43,698 --> 01:25:45,663
I heard it after long.

935
01:25:47,972 --> 01:25:50,884
I'm sure she was your wife, sir.
- Why so?

936
01:25:52,067 --> 01:25:55,947
Girfriend will only lament
and not listen to your problems.

937
01:25:58,828 --> 01:26:02,875
Can you please drop me at NH 44?
- Of course, sir.

938
01:26:06,693 --> 01:26:09,270
Narayan! Narayan!

939
01:26:09,615 --> 01:26:12,923
Satellite Shankar...

940
01:26:13,513 --> 01:26:17,032
He is smarter than you.
- I've become his fan.

941
01:26:17,397 --> 01:26:20,968
I want to meet this guy.
- Satellite Shankar did a great job.

942
01:26:21,088 --> 01:26:26,141
Mathura, Agra, Jhansi,
his name is everywhere.

943
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:29,679
Satellite Shankar is a superman.
- Chennai and Tamilnadu as well.

944
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:33,488
Satellite Shankar is my hero, man.
- In buses, trains...

945
01:26:33,835 --> 01:26:38,155
He saves everyone's life.
- He is a true hero of our country.

946
01:26:39,703 --> 01:26:42,696
I must say, he is awesome.

947
01:26:43,123 --> 01:26:47,495
Madam has got herself into
trouble with her lie.

948
01:26:47,615 --> 01:26:50,627
She'll be insulted on national
level. Wait and watch.

949
01:28:58,010 --> 01:28:59,902
Pramila...

950
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:04,820
Shankar? Did you just come?
- Yes, I just came.

951
01:29:05,049 --> 01:29:08,806
I came at 4:00AM and was awake till
5:00AM to take the 8:00AM train.

952
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:11,140
But then I dozed off.
Had you come an hour back,

953
01:29:11,260 --> 01:29:13,980
we could've taken Palakkad express
which would've halted in Pollachi.

954
01:29:14,323 --> 01:29:16,787
What?
- Nothing.

955
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:22,512
I spoke to you over the phone in
Hindi, you sound so different.

956
01:29:23,902 --> 01:29:25,943
You speak so fast.

957
01:29:26,907 --> 01:29:29,863
When you speak in Hindi, it feels
there's time to breathe.

958
01:29:30,356 --> 01:29:33,479
On hearing you speak in Tamil,
it's like, I must run for my life.

959
01:29:35,067 --> 01:29:38,964
Is that so? If two Tamilians
meet and speak in Hindi,

960
01:29:39,084 --> 01:29:41,564
and dad gets to know of it,
he'll cancel the marriage proposal.

961
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,759
Thank God, you cancelled it
before he did.

962
01:29:44,542 --> 01:29:46,158
Hey, Pramila. I did
not cancel it.

963
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:47,902
- Forget about it,
we have no time.

964
01:29:48,022 --> 01:29:51,210
Palakkad express is gone.
That halts at Pollachi. Now, sit.

965
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:54,360
But never mind.

966
01:29:55,873 --> 01:29:59,858
We have another train in half
an hour, but it has limited stops.

967
01:30:00,271 --> 01:30:02,700
Salem to Dindikkal, Palani,
then Palakkad.

968
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,392
It won't halt at Pollachi.
- No. It will go via Pollachi.

969
01:30:05,512 --> 01:30:07,195
I'll jump out if it goes slow.

970
01:30:07,587 --> 01:30:11,414
Your aunt told me, you look
exactly like Mahesh Babu.

971
01:30:12,161 --> 01:30:14,176
Mahesh Babu?

972
01:30:17,264 --> 01:30:18,364
Do I?

973
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:21,062
That is why, I didn't
recognize you immediately.

974
01:30:22,146 --> 01:30:24,258
Periamma's problem.

975
01:30:25,705 --> 01:30:28,265
How long will it take for you
to reach home from Palakkad?

976
01:30:28,385 --> 01:30:31,133
It's close by. I'll take an hour.

977
01:30:31,253 --> 01:30:32,473
Okay, so we'll get off at Palakkad.

978
01:30:32,553 --> 01:30:34,712
You go home and I'll go
to Coimbatore Airport.

979
01:30:36,592 --> 01:30:39,346
Why will you go to the airport?

980
01:30:39,466 --> 01:30:41,799
You have to join duty tomorrow
morning at Kashmir.

981
01:30:42,063 --> 01:30:43,018
Didn't you say that?

982
01:30:43,138 --> 01:30:46,468
Yes, but airport? - How else
will you reach in such short time?

983
01:30:46,588 --> 01:30:50,057
I'm not a wonder woman to carry
you and fly to drop you there.

984
01:30:51,443 --> 01:30:55,208
Flight tickets are too expensive.
- It's between 4 to 8 thousand.

985
01:30:55,328 --> 01:30:57,637
In the last minute, it could be
double the amount.

986
01:30:57,839 --> 01:30:59,959
But don't worry, I've carried
my debit card.

987
01:31:00,843 --> 01:31:04,098
Pramila, no...
- Don't worry.

988
01:31:04,218 --> 01:31:06,720
Return it later.
Like a loan. - No...

989
01:31:07,292 --> 01:31:09,157
I can afford to buy it too.

990
01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:11,968
But my mom will shout at me.

991
01:31:12,936 --> 01:31:15,399
Does your mom check your account?

992
01:31:16,112 --> 01:31:19,974
No, well... - It's okay.
My dad checks my account too.

993
01:31:20,610 --> 01:31:22,387
Really?
- But I'll dare to take this risk.

994
01:31:22,616 --> 01:31:25,624
I have to do that as I need
to keep my promise.

995
01:31:26,627 --> 01:31:28,235
From Coimbatore to
Srinagar, there

996
01:31:28,275 --> 01:31:29,970
was a morning flight
which is gone.

997
01:31:30,268 --> 01:31:32,634
My friend told me, there's one in
the afternoon too.

998
01:31:32,889 --> 01:31:34,020
That's not showing on internet.

999
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:37,156
I need to go there and check.
- Okay. - Did you eat?

1000
01:31:37,658 --> 01:31:40,816
Not yet. It's okay, Pramila.

1001
01:31:43,871 --> 01:31:47,161
Are you a fan of Mahesh Babu?
- No.

1002
01:31:47,452 --> 01:31:50,249
Vijay.
- Dalapathy Vijay!

1003
01:31:54,279 --> 01:31:56,417
But I don't intend to marry him.

1004
01:31:57,860 --> 01:32:00,064
Idiyappam! I prepared these.
Would you like to try some?

1005
01:32:01,444 --> 01:32:04,153
Thank you. It's okay
even if you get a flight to Jammu.

1006
01:32:04,273 --> 01:32:05,714
You will get another flight from
Jammu to Srinagar.

1007
01:32:05,794 --> 01:32:07,376
I'll go to Coimbatore and check.

1008
01:32:07,496 --> 01:32:08,755
Or I will go to Cochin.

1009
01:32:08,946 --> 01:32:11,712
You just stay alert,
I can call you anywhere. Okay?

1010
01:32:11,915 --> 01:32:14,140
How much time will you need
to spend at home?

1011
01:32:14,549 --> 01:32:18,033
Around two... - Two hours?
At home, two hours. Total, 3 hours.

1012
01:32:18,311 --> 01:32:20,458
Do you wish to marry Alia Bhatt?

1013
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:26,422
Who told you that? Did Sridhar
say that to you/.

1014
01:32:27,166 --> 01:32:31,512
Don't believe him, he is a liar.
I just gave you his number.

1015
01:32:39,352 --> 01:32:44,463
Ready? Okay, guys. Hi. Please
allow me to give you this update

1016
01:32:44,684 --> 01:32:48,889
in Hindi. Our small, humble blog,
1 MB of truth.

1017
01:32:49,009 --> 01:32:51,670
Like the main stream media
people have been saying so,

1018
01:32:51,879 --> 01:32:54,749
from today, one million
English speaking Netizens

1019
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:57,530
won't influence us all.
Because this is now

1020
01:32:57,917 --> 01:33:02,606
a meeting sound. From Baramulla to
Barabunki, Cuttack to Coonoor.

1021
01:33:02,726 --> 01:33:06,056
10 million Indians have joined us
from all over the country.

1022
01:33:06,285 --> 01:33:09,742
And this was made possible
because of one of our soldier.

1023
01:33:09,862 --> 01:33:11,837
All thanks to the story
of a true hero.

1024
01:33:12,057 --> 01:33:15,145
And this happened because of
your love towards our army.

1025
01:33:15,682 --> 01:33:18,409
So, it is now time to...
- Wake up, now.

1026
01:33:18,747 --> 01:33:21,351
To meet the soldier.
Right now, we are

1027
01:33:21,471 --> 01:33:24,439
at Salem railway station,
where according to our information,

1028
01:33:24,662 --> 01:33:27,204
he is present. So, any moment,

1029
01:33:27,324 --> 01:33:29,625
we will be meeting him.
So, let me tell you,

1030
01:33:29,745 --> 01:33:32,598
if you're sleeping, wake up
and sit straight.

1031
01:33:32,871 --> 01:33:37,314
Say hello, Namaste, Sasriyakal,
Vanakkam, Asalaam Valekum, Kem Cho.

1032
01:33:37,725 --> 01:33:40,549
Satellite Shankar!
- Say anything you want.

1033
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:44,859
But madam has caught
the attention of the entire country.

1034
01:33:48,652 --> 01:33:51,547
Pramila, I want to tell you
something very honestly.

1035
01:33:51,872 --> 01:33:54,142
About Sridhar?

1036
01:33:55,334 --> 01:33:59,223
I want to clear that as well,
but I'm confused as to how to begin.

1037
01:33:59,495 --> 01:34:02,469
I want to tell you something
very important too.

1038
01:34:02,707 --> 01:34:06,115
But I was wondering if I should
say this or not.

1039
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:10,373
What is it about?
- No, you go first.

1040
01:34:11,147 --> 01:34:13,998
You say it.
- Shankar...

1041
01:34:15,247 --> 01:34:19,734
Will you keep this a secret that
I came here from Coonoor for you?

1042
01:34:20,711 --> 01:34:23,790
I told my friends,
I'm going with my family.

1043
01:34:24,121 --> 01:34:26,122
And I told my family,
I'm with friends.

1044
01:34:26,377 --> 01:34:28,964
If my dad hears this,
he'll die of shame.

1045
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:33,121
I'm doing something like this for
the first time in life. I'm scared.

1046
01:34:33,785 --> 01:34:36,635
Will you keep this a secret?
- Ladies and gentlemen...

1047
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:40,111
Citizens and Netizens, here's
the man you've been waiting to meet

1048
01:34:40,231 --> 01:34:43,656
for so long. The good soldier!
The winner of all hearts.

1049
01:34:43,776 --> 01:34:47,615
Satellite Shankar!
- Madam, what are you doing?

1050
01:34:48,019 --> 01:34:50,236
Shankar, you remember me?
- Yes, but this camera...

1051
01:34:50,356 --> 01:34:52,761
Shut... - Hold on.
- Ask him to shut the camera.

1052
01:34:52,881 --> 01:34:55,604
Hold on. I'm sorry,
we didn't want to harass you

1053
01:34:55,724 --> 01:34:59,492
try to bother you. We just want
that millions of your fans

1054
01:34:59,612 --> 01:35:02,169
meet you. India has been looking
for you since four days,

1055
01:35:02,289 --> 01:35:03,583
trying to talk to you.

1056
01:35:03,703 --> 01:35:07,815
India? - Yeah. - Who India?
- Our country, Shankar.

1057
01:35:07,935 --> 01:35:10,208
From Jammu till here,
you have

1058
01:35:10,328 --> 01:35:13,878
touched the hearts of so many.
And your bravery in Agra...

1059
01:35:14,124 --> 01:35:17,846
And the way you thrashed those
goons, all those stories

1060
01:35:17,966 --> 01:35:22,334
was covered by me, by the grace
of God and showed it to India.

1061
01:35:22,454 --> 01:35:26,487
After that, the kind of responses
we've got, you have no idea of it.

1062
01:35:26,691 --> 01:35:29,796
Right now, there is no greater
hero than you in our country.- Hero?

1063
01:35:30,931 --> 01:35:34,186
What are you talking? Please leave.
I am already worked up.

1064
01:35:34,306 --> 01:35:39,369
I understand, you'd taken 8 days
leave to visit your home

1065
01:35:39,489 --> 01:35:41,781
in Pollachi and are still trying
to get there. That's the beauty

1066
01:35:41,861 --> 01:35:44,838
of the story, guys. The hero
doesn't even know, he is a hero.

1067
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:48,348
This great soldier of Rashtriya
Rifles... - What's going on?

1068
01:35:49,443 --> 01:35:52,381
Who told you, you could publicize
my name and regiment details?

1069
01:35:52,636 --> 01:35:53,636
She is gone!

1070
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:57,854
Madam, what you're doing is wrong.
I am not a hero.

1071
01:36:01,469 --> 01:36:03,589
I'm an ordinary soldier
of the Indian army. That's it.

1072
01:36:03,990 --> 01:36:06,778
Have you seen a helmet hung on
a rifle on our Amar Jawan Jyoti?

1073
01:36:07,016 --> 01:36:09,681
That's my identity
and that's all I need.

1074
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:12,760
Whatever I did is what I thought
was the duty of an Indian citizen.

1075
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:14,113
You want to stir the nation

1076
01:36:14,323 --> 01:36:16,643
Wake those people who are mere
spectators during accidents.

1077
01:36:16,748 --> 01:36:17,848
And who blame the system.

1078
01:36:18,058 --> 01:36:20,917
And people like them who only shoot
videos on their mobile phone.

1079
01:36:21,247 --> 01:36:23,447
But they don't help their own people
who are in trouble.

1080
01:36:23,688 --> 01:36:25,368
Stop this drama
and leave with your camera.

1081
01:36:25,563 --> 01:36:27,784
Oh, gosh!

1082
01:36:29,178 --> 01:36:31,975
Okay, please calm down.
- It's not okay.

1083
01:36:32,095 --> 01:36:34,183
Tell me right now that you'll
stop doing all this.

1084
01:36:35,895 --> 01:36:40,628
Okay, soldier. I promise, I will
never mention you on my blog.

1085
01:36:57,112 --> 01:36:59,980
Sorry, I raised my hand.

1086
01:37:00,182 --> 01:37:02,206
Sorry.

1087
01:37:16,610 --> 01:37:18,653
Well, guys. As
promised to the man,

1088
01:37:18,693 --> 01:37:20,719
this is me signing
off this story.

1089
01:37:20,839 --> 01:37:23,508
It's over to you, India from
here on. Jai Hind!

1090
01:37:28,370 --> 01:37:32,839
Your prediction that she'd be
insulted, came true.

1091
01:37:33,824 --> 01:37:36,384
The one she turned into a hero,
insulted her...

1092
01:37:40,961 --> 01:37:43,970
Bad!
- Chote...

1093
01:37:44,340 --> 01:37:47,366
Get the camera.
- Brother, are you ready?

1094
01:37:48,889 --> 01:37:53,077
Can't we help Shankar
without his knowledge?

1095
01:37:53,385 --> 01:37:55,874
He lost his holidays,
to help us.

1096
01:37:56,591 --> 01:38:00,418
Isn't it our duty to help him
reach his base?

1097
01:38:01,087 --> 01:38:03,145
We can at least respect his
profession.

1098
01:38:03,365 --> 01:38:05,609
Mira has promised not to
take this story further ahead.

1099
01:38:06,814 --> 01:38:08,679
We haven't.

1100
01:38:09,998 --> 01:38:12,180
Check this video.

1101
01:38:14,534 --> 01:38:18,352
Today is his 7th day of his leave.
We'll help him reach Kashmir.

1102
01:38:19,971 --> 01:38:21,792
I'm 20 miles here
from Salem station.

1103
01:38:22,241 --> 01:38:24,563
Does anybody know
where Shankar is right now?

1104
01:38:25,847 --> 01:38:28,658
He is in Palakkad Superfast
general coach. My friend

1105
01:38:28,778 --> 01:38:30,857
is in that coach
and the information is true.

1106
01:38:59,493 --> 01:39:02,467
Why did the journalist
call you Satellite?

1107
01:39:02,845 --> 01:39:06,030
Did she think you were an alien
and not a soldier?

1108
01:39:06,528 --> 01:39:09,695
No. That's what everyone
calls me as. Here...

1109
01:39:10,707 --> 01:39:14,112
It's all thanks to this.
This is Satellite.

1110
01:39:14,626 --> 01:39:17,978
My childhood friend. When
my dad went for duty,

1111
01:39:18,568 --> 01:39:20,960
everyone back at home
used to miss him so much.

1112
01:39:21,392 --> 01:39:24,972
With its magic, I used to show my
mom and grandma his live telecast.

1113
01:39:27,282 --> 01:39:30,493
Gurjyot, what say?

1114
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:33,950
I love you, darling.

1115
01:39:36,237 --> 01:39:38,533
Gurjyot! Is that your mom's name?

1116
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:42,805
This is only a toy.

1117
01:39:45,818 --> 01:39:49,407
The true satellite is in our
hearts. His heart, your heart.

1118
01:39:49,527 --> 01:39:52,067
In everyone's hearts.
We just need to connect.

1119
01:39:52,603 --> 01:39:56,114
Once you think of somebody
with love, you connect to them.

1120
01:39:57,841 --> 01:40:01,149
You connect to everyone,
except me. Right?

1121
01:40:02,759 --> 01:40:05,134
Pramila, listen...

1122
01:40:08,359 --> 01:40:12,485
Guys, don't bother him directly.
You saw how he fumed at Mira.

1123
01:40:12,740 --> 01:40:16,197
He won't even know and the job
will be done, if we smartly handle.

1124
01:40:16,598 --> 01:40:19,915
Palakkad Superfast does not halt
at Pollachi. I checked on Google.

1125
01:40:20,117 --> 01:40:23,530
Can anybody contact
the driver or guard of this route?

1126
01:40:26,261 --> 01:40:28,284
Looks like, the whole
country is determined

1127
01:40:28,478 --> 01:40:30,123
to have Shankar keep his promise.

1128
01:40:31,214 --> 01:40:33,740
There are thousand things
that divide our country.

1129
01:40:34,233 --> 01:40:35,843
But a soldier got them all together.

1130
01:40:36,963 --> 01:40:38,520
They're so united!

1131
01:40:39,460 --> 01:40:42,786
Hello, southern railways?
- Pollachi is not in my list.

1132
01:40:43,076 --> 01:40:46,604
If I halt there, I will lose
my job. Try to understand.

1133
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:49,568
What are you talking?
Who are you?

1134
01:41:44,839 --> 01:41:47,857
You must be wondering
why did I risk my job.

1135
01:41:48,108 --> 01:41:52,015
It's for those who risk
their lives for us, every day.

1136
01:42:15,609 --> 01:42:17,843
Come inside.

1137
01:42:19,028 --> 01:42:22,749
Come, sir. Have a seat.
- What are you doing, Sridhar?

1138
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:26,259
And this doctor? - You won't
go to the hospital for operation.

1139
01:42:26,527 --> 01:42:30,416
So, the hospital will have to come
here. Let me check your BP.

1140
01:42:30,536 --> 01:42:33,671
No. I don't want to get
any operation. Take this away.

1141
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,948
Get up and leave.
- Mom... - Get lost!

1142
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:40,423
The one who took the responsibility
of the operation doesn't care.

1143
01:42:40,543 --> 01:42:42,498
Why do you come to disturb me?

1144
01:42:42,618 --> 01:42:45,939
The one who took the responsibility
has called us here.

1145
01:42:46,199 --> 01:42:50,237
You see carefully.
Look, who is there!

1146
01:42:55,233 --> 01:42:57,521
Shankar!

1147
01:43:38,059 --> 01:43:41,658
Mom, the Bature is so delicious.
Can I have more? - A mom feeds

1148
01:43:41,778 --> 01:43:44,156
her son Payasam and Idiyappam.

1149
01:43:44,276 --> 01:43:46,664
But she feeds Bature.

1150
01:43:46,876 --> 01:43:50,651
You'll spoil the child's religion.
- What religion? - Tamil customs!

1151
01:43:53,703 --> 01:43:56,843
Here, have it. Have some more.

1152
01:43:56,963 --> 01:44:00,151
Hello, Shankar. There's no flight
from Coimbatore right now.

1153

1210
01:52:20,537 --> 01:52:23,150
Thought of asking you,

01:52:32,145 --> 01:52:33,694
Why are you doing this for me?

1214
01:52:34,333 --> 01:52:36,550
Sir, who is behind all this?

1215
01:52:42,590 --> 01:52:44,359
I thought it would be you.

1216
01:52:44,479 --> 01:52:47,605
But I told you not...
- I kept my promise, soldier.

1217
01:52:47,974 --> 01:52:51,555
I didn't post a single post of
yours on my blog after that.

1218
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:54,824
Whatever is happening with you,

1219
01:52:55,448 --> 01:52:58,378
India is doing it for their soldier.

1220
01:53:00,151 --> 01:53:03,054
We take our loved ones's
safety and wishes

1221
01:53:03,174 --> 01:53:05,034
for granted always.

1222
01:53:05,799 --> 01:53:08,289
For the sake of our happiness

1223
01:53:08,654 --> 01:53:13,115
and safety, so many Satellite
Shankars sacrifice their family,

1224
01:53:13,713 --> 01:53:16,871
their freedom and rest,

1225
01:53:16,991 --> 01:53:19,239
and fight at the border
day and night.

1226
01:53:20,339 --> 01:53:22,714
What do we do in return,
for them?

1227
01:53:24,354 --> 01:53:27,856
Can't we stand together happily

1228
01:53:28,155 --> 01:53:31,427
and try to even thank them? Today,

1229
01:53:32,545 --> 01:53:34,558
this is exactly
what our nation did, soldier.

1230
01:53:38,561 --> 01:53:40,276
Thank you.

1231
01:53:42,736 --> 01:53:46,193
Jai Hind, madam. - Jai Hind!
Jai Hind, Army!

1232
01:54:03,360 --> 01:54:05,691
Sujeeva...

1233
01:54:29,569 --> 01:54:33,026
Will Shankar reach on time?
- Why do you worry?

1234
01:54:33,146 --> 01:54:35,956
Have faith in God.
He'll make it on time.

1235
01:55:23,653 --> 01:55:26,618
He is there!
- Come on.

1236
01:55:29,024 --> 01:55:32,112
Hey...

1237
01:55:39,623 --> 01:55:42,993
Wasim! Tahir, son.
Come quickly!

1238
01:55:44,321 --> 01:55:46,670
Hey, you!

1239
01:55:47,627 --> 01:55:50,179
Hit him!

1240
01:58:57,252 --> 01:58:58,844
Stop!

1241
01:59:10,640 --> 01:59:13,842
Are you out of your mind?
Will you save an enemy?

1242
01:59:14,335 --> 01:59:18,513
Not an enemy, but humanity. To help
this child reach his destination,

1243
01:59:18,633 --> 01:59:21,956
the entire universe is striving.
If he loses today,

1244
01:59:22,188 --> 01:59:24,974
humanity will die!

1245
01:59:28,066 --> 01:59:31,215
If he loses today,
humanity will die!

1246
01:59:32,385 --> 01:59:35,429
You may put up this drama
on some other day.

1247
01:59:36,375 --> 01:59:40,669
Today, humanity is being worshipped
and it won't tolerate any evil!

1248
01:59:49,746 --> 01:59:53,652
To help a soldier
reach his destination,

1249
01:59:53,772 --> 01:59:56,749
even Kashmir will pray.
- Come on, hit him!

1250
02:00:17,166 --> 02:00:19,392
Come on, son!

1251
02:00:43,229 --> 02:00:46,106
Stop this now!

1252
02:00:50,179 --> 02:00:52,669
Go, son. May you be victorious.

1253
02:00:53,408 --> 02:00:55,379
God willing!

1254
02:00:56,663 --> 02:00:58,370
