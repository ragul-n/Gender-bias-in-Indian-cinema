2
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:17,630
It was mom.

3
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,628
How come you're feeling
all low suddenly?

4
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:22,902
Nothing.

5
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,562
She only wants to know what's
the status of my job hunt.

6
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,640
I'm fed up of saying that
it will be all right.

7
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,444
Don't you have two elder
brothers in the U.S. and Sydney?

8
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:33,637
No point.

9
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,541
Even if they do something,

10
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,681
I'd have to hear their taunts about
helping me, for my whole life.

11
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:40,983
Didn't you say that your
mom went to London?

12
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,848
She called from there.
- At Kunjumol's place?

13
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,550
Yes. She's the only one who wants
to help me out in some way.

14
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:48,586
Didn't I tell you that she
had sent a UK Visa for me?

15
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,630
If nothing is working out here,
I'll go there.

16
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,457
Don't be so desperate.

17
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:55,693
Something will work out.

18
00:03:55,868 --> 00:03:56,835
It's not that.

19
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,871
Mom said something
unusual today...

20
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,837
'If something happens to me here,

21
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,739
you should get me buried
back in our hometown'.

22
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,410
Ever since I heard that,

23
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,578
I feel weird..

24
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,780
That's a usual statement from old people.
She's quite healthy, rig ht?

25
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,781
She has no health
problems as such.

26
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:15,221
Enough. Come.

27
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,488
Let's go to some pub.

28
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,778
So stylish, right?

29
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,954
What is it?
Are you feeling tempted?

30
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:10,989
Hey!

31
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,152
I have told you something.

32
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,893
If God calls me while I am here,

33
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,657
you should get me buried
in our hometown, okay?

34
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,062
It's a promise that you gave me.

35
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,534
Stop it, mom!

36
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:24,534
When I made a joke,
you're hanging on to that?

37
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,571
Com e.

38
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:27,230
It's not yet time for you to go.

39
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,565
Trust me!

40
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,474
Don't talk too much
with your big mouth.

41
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:34,939
I have told the same
thing to Jomon as well.

42
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:37,984
Us children will do whatever
necessary when it's time.

43
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,609
I have two elder sons, right?

44
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,175
I don't trust them.

45
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:43,655
They are both multi-millionaires.
You know, right?

46
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,280
Oh Christ!

47
00:09:17,657 --> 00:09:21,287
(chanting prayers)

48
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,032
Hey Mercy, I'm getting late.

49
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:35,332
Where's my lunchbox?

50
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:37,100
It's on the table.
- It's here.

51
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:38,666
My sweetie...

52
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,245
Come on, hurry up.
You're already late.

53
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:46,345
Good morning.

54
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,178
How come you're quite
well dressed today?

55
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:50,788
EM;
a

56
00:09:50,856 --> 00:09:51,914
Elegant.

57
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,354
Okay.
See you later.

58
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,939
You're getting really late.
You need to hurry up, okay?

59
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,579
Mom, should I get you coffee
now, or afterl come back?

60
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:19,251
You go and come back.

61
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,283
Lara, Milan" We're getting late.
Hurry up!

62
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,047
(Kisses)

63
00:10:26,392 --> 00:10:27,359
See yo u.

64
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:28,819
Come on!

65
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:30,963
Bye.
- Com e.

66
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,097
Come on, fast.

67
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,139
Com e, com e.

68
00:10:43,075 --> 00:10:44,372
Go! Go!
Fast.

69
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:49,815
Get inside.

70
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,116
Come on.

71
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,120
Okay.

72
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,417
Bye, mom.

73
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,359
Mom!

74
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,164
Mom!

75
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,202
Mom!

76
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,200
Look at you!
Is this the time to sleep?

77
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:26,244
You need to have breakfast
<i>&</i> take your medicines.

78
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,279
Get up, mom.

79
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:28,710
Mom, get UP-

80
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:30,248
Mom!

81
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,512
Mom!

82
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:03,849
Mom!

83
00:13:37,883 --> 00:13:38,850
Jesus!

84
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,245
Don't extinguish this flame!

85
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,887
When she heard that you're coming,
she had told me...

86
00:13:47,092 --> 00:13:48,992
'Hey! This time she's coming...

87
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,554
to take me also along with her.'

88
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,093
She's not really fond of travelling.

89
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:57,002
I know, Mathukkutty.

90
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,335
Still, leaving mom alone here like this,

91
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,202
how can we stay
relaxed over there?

92
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,566
But. We are all here for her.

93
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,545
But still, if she has to be taken
to the hospital suddenly...

94
00:14:06,612 --> 00:14:08,011
you know how far it is, rig ht?

95
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,623
Hey!

96
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:21,092
If you're done saying bye to dad,

97
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,360
shall we leave?

98
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:09,975
What is this?

99
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,669
Are you planning to sleep early?

100
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,045
I was lying down just like that.

101
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,940
I haven't packed my bags yet.

102
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,883
Don't pack a lot of stuff.

103
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:21,317
Take only what's
absolutely necessary.

104
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:23,219
Rest we can buy from there.

105
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,524
But still, I need to carry
the necessary stuff, right?

106
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,255
Mathukkutty, keep it there.

107
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,457
I've packed all the
necessary stuff.

108
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,255
Open it.
Let me see.

109
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,434
I know what you're looking for.

110
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,300
The Bible, dad's photo,

111
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,202
the rosary blessed from Rome,

112
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,239
it's all in there.

113
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,436
Mom!

114
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,915
Mom!

115
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,061
Anto!

116
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,495
Anto, get up.

117
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,265
Get up!

118
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,034
Anto!
- What is it?

119
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,570
Kunjumol called from London.
- What happened now?

120
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,264
Mom.
- She's gone?

121
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,339
Yes.

122
00:16:17,443 --> 00:16:18,410
Ammini...

123
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,945
Ammini, where is the funeral?

124
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,177
Gammy]?

125
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,117
Then? How can I not go?
You should also come.

126
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:30,679
What will I do after coming there?
- What will you do?

127
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,157
No decision has been made
about our ancestral house.

128
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,956
It's a chance to get together
and take a decision.

129
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:38,093
Go and book the tickets, man!

130
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,726
We'll leave the children
at Sally's house.

131
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:47,435
Such unwanted trouble.

132
00:16:47,773 --> 00:16:49,673
But it's good that we just
have to go till London.

133
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,574
At least we don't have
to go to Kattappana!

134
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,109
Such a bad hangover!

135
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:58,744
Hey!

136
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,179
If you touch the bottle,
I'll chop your hands off.

137
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,157
Get lost.

138
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:10,462
Okay.

139
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,097
I'll reach.

140
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:13,198
Kids are not here.

141
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,699
Let me check the tickets.

142
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,694
Mollykkutty?
- I'm not coming.

143
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,200
Molly is not feeling well.

144
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,233
She won't be able to travel now.

145
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,311
Okay.

146
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,090
Mom didn't find any other
time to leave or what?

147
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,322
When I called last week, she didn't
mention any health problems.

148
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:47,093
I left to the school after seeing
mom all dressed up after her bath.

149
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,464
What's the point in saying all that now?
She's gone, rig ht?

150
00:17:49,668 --> 00:17:51,261
You hang up.
Let me check tickets.

151
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,507
I had a London trip
scheduled for next month.

152
00:17:58,343 --> 00:17:59,435
If this had happened then...

153
00:18:00,145 --> 00:18:01,271
Hey Susan.
- Yes.

154
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:02,312
What is it?

155
00:18:02,448 --> 00:18:03,813
Well... Mom...

156
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:05,208
Oh no!

157
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,583
And yeah.. I have day duty
for the whole of next week.

158
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,185
I can't come along.

159
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,246
What happened?
- Your granny is gone.

160
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,721
Oh! Poor thing.

161
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:16,693
We will also come to London
for granny's funeral.

162
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,756
It's my mom who died.

163
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:20,729
I'll take you when your mom dies.

164
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,659
I know that you're
waiting for it, Benny.

165
00:18:35,914 --> 00:18:36,881
Joe...

166
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,110
It's Kunjumol, from London.

167
00:18:42,721 --> 00:18:43,688
Kunjumol...

168
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:46,825
Moji...

169
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,663
What is it?

170
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,093
Joe's mother...

171
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,566
At London?

172
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,700
Yes.

173
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,654
Com e.

174
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:29,791
You have the Visa, right?

175
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,236
Yes.

176
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,237
Don't worry about the ticket.

177
00:19:34,306 --> 00:19:35,273
Hey!

178
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,838
Just call Nasser lkka.

179
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,483
Are you all right?

180
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:48,815
I got through to Jomon.

181
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:51,245
He would be reaching first.

00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,222
There would be good funeral directors
and such companies in London, right?

184
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,525
Yes, of course.

185
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,962
Contact one of them.

186
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,726
Anyway, let things be quite grand.

187
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:03,768
All right.

188
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,599
Don't worry about the budget.

189
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:07,405
Let us share it.

190
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:11,369
Isn't that how it should be?

191
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:13,973
Yeah. Okay.

192
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,885
Oh God!

193
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,754
Don't think that
I'm praising them!

194
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:29,317
I haven't seen anyone as
stingy as your elder brothers!

195
00:20:29,828 --> 00:20:31,796
He wants me to share the
funeral expense, it seems.

196
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,875
Jessie...
- Yes.

197
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,248
Ask them to keep 2 rolls of paper inside.
- Okay.

198
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:57,285
Hey Unni.
- Tell me, mom.

199
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:58,721
When is the funeral?

200
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:02,624
All of them should reach here, right?
From Canada, U.S. and Australia...

201
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,251
It would take 3-4 days.

202
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,293
What about the body until then?

203
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:07,799
It's supposed to be
kept in the mortuary.

204
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,391
But Ammini...

205
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:10,629
Mercy's elder sister...

206
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,496
Ammini has an emotional problem.

207
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:14,639
That's the problem now.

208
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,572
You stopped going for work after
marrying a cardiac surgeon.

209
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,677
Out of my desperation,
I'm still working as a nurse.

210
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,807
Don't us nurses know how bad
the methods in mortuaries are?

211
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,909
I can't come and see my
mother in a mortuary.

212
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,278
All frozen up...

213
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:31,254
So, you should keep her
in your house itself.

214
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:33,690
And bring the Father from the Church you
go to, and offer her final prayers.

215
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,919
Even though she's dead,
we should take care of her, rig ht?

216
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:39,258
That's the issue, mom.

217
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:41,026
That would bring about harms to you.

218
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,627
No doubt about it.

219
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,027
We're not like Christians.

220
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,570
Once dead, the funeral
should be done on time.

221
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,597
That's our tradition.

222
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,979
It's a house where I set up a Pooja room
(Hindu Prayer room) when I came last time.

223
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,547
You cannot keep the corpse
at home for three days.

224
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:02,317
If you are disobedient,

225
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,888
it will be you and your
children who will be harmed.

226
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:08,855
My dear Valsamma.
I said I'll call you!

227
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:12,758
That doctor is waiting there.

228
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,799
Where the hell is Raju, when
we have a meeting here?

229
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:15,833
He's about to reach.

230
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:17,926
He just called.
- Is his issue with his wife over?

231
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:18,970
No way!

232
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,664
Ask him to cry and
fall at her feet.

233
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,901
He is ready to cry, fall at her
feet, and grind coconuts for her.

234
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,500
But she should also
allow that, rig ht?

235
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:54,405
Morning!

236
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:55,773
Oh! He's here.

237
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,502
<i>My dear Raw, where were you'?</i>

238
00:22:57,576 --> 00:22:59,476
Cardiac surgeon,
Dr. Mukundanunni.

239
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,511
He's dead?
- Get lost.

240
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,570
He's waiting outside.
Did anyone die from his family?

241
00:23:02,647 --> 00:23:03,944
<i>Em</i>
a

242
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,449
They're loaded with cash.

243
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:07,383
Her children are in
Canada & New York.

244
00:23:07,686 --> 00:23:09,916
We can definitely get
above 10,000 Pounds.

245
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,956
How much?
- 10,000 Pounds, dude.

246
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:14,788
What is this, Manoharan?
Shouldn't we show some decency?

247
00:23:15,093 --> 00:23:17,585
This is the only death that has
happened in the past 2-3 months.

248
00:23:17,662 --> 00:23:18,788
Let me make a living somehow.

249
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:19,831
Jessie...

250
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,956
What are their requirements?

251
00:23:22,134 --> 00:23:24,535
Airport pick up and
drop for 5 persons.

252
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,903
Funeral costume: Male - 10,
Female - 5...

253
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,533
Just a minute.
Kunjachayan is calling.

254
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,072
Whenever we're discussing something,
he always gets a call.

255
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:36,943
Kunjachayan!
Tell me!

256
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,816
Hey Raju!
What's happening?

257
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:41,853
Going on...

258
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:43,114
It's Kunjachayan.

259
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,814
Kunjachayan?
Who's that?

260
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,392
The ex-MLA of Kerala Congress,
Thomas Jacob.

261
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:48,551
His political connection.

262
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,089
That party itself is
hanging in uncertainty.

263
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,055
But Podiyan...

264
00:23:53,532 --> 00:23:55,728
There's nothing that Kunjachayan
can't do in Kottayam.

265
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:58,434
My dear, I called you...

266
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:00,470
for a boy close to me,
from Mannanam.

267
00:24:00,539 --> 00:24:03,600
He came to London for some job,

268
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,871
and called me saying that
he's in some kind of trouble.

269
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,470
Will you be able to help him out
and get him a job somewhere?

270
00:24:08,547 --> 00:24:09,878
Is he really close to you?

271
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:11,915
Yes. He's a distant relative, as well.

272
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,618
Othen/vise, why would I call you?

273
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,411
Okay! Give him my number,
and ask him to call me.

274
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,682
Okay.
Thank you so much.

275
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,490
Okay.

276
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:31,969
Sir...

277
00:24:32,204 --> 00:24:33,535
Ybs?
- Shall we start, sir?

278
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,605
Okay mom.

279
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,004
I'll call you.
- Okay.

280
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,939
<i>Okay.
- Okay, fight.</i>

281
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,111
Please come.

282
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:45,540
I had told him several times not to
get married to that Christian girl.

283
00:24:45,617 --> 00:24:46,584
He didn't listen!

284
00:24:46,751 --> 00:24:47,843
What to do now?

285
00:24:48,086 --> 00:24:49,850
Podiya, get up and sit there.

286
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,112
Don't let this go.

287
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,788
Hi Doctor. Hello!
- Hello!

288
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,483
Raju.
- Hello Doctor.

289
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,528
Please sit down.

290
00:24:58,129 --> 00:25:01,099
Doctor, we went through
your entire requirements.

291
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,632
The entire cost of the
funeral will come around...

292
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,762
That's okay.
Money is not the issue.

293
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:08,203
Okay.
- The issue is something else.

294
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:10,842
Aren't they burying the corpse?
- Shut up, man.

295
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:12,070
Sorry. Tell me.
- That is...

296
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,703
Keeping the body at
home for two days...

297
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:18,077
it's a slightly
delicate problem.

298
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,049
Hey! Don't worry, doctor.

299
00:25:21,086 --> 00:25:24,579
Once you sign this agreement with us,
the first thing we'll do is that...

300
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,985
we'll take the body and take
it directly to the mortuary.

301
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,185
That's the law here.

302
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:31,922
Hey, come on! He knows everything.
- Yes! Yes!

303
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,055
No! No!
It's not that!

304
00:25:33,164 --> 00:25:34,290
The problem is...

305
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:40,068
Some family members have an objection
in keeping the body in a mortuary.

306
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:41,105
That is the problem.

307
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:44,073
So, what I suggest is...

308
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,678
If we can find a space,

309
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,505
for two or three days,

310
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,747
if we can find a
building or a house,

311
00:25:51,016 --> 00:25:54,884
we can shift the body there,
in a freezing unit.

312
00:25:55,754 --> 00:25:56,880
Such a space?

313
00:25:56,955 --> 00:25:58,923
To find such a space...

314
00:25:59,024 --> 00:26:01,789
Such a space...
Well, doctor...

315
00:26:02,661 --> 00:26:06,097
Firstly, to find a house
to store a dead body is...

316
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,758
Neighbours might create
a lot of trouble.

317
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,527
And, since it is your case...

318
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,728
You think about it.

319
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:14,062
Please think about something.

320
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:15,664
Such a space...

321
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,174
There is such a space.

322
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,869
Your house?
- My house?

323
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,309
There are other people there.

324
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,782
Okay. There is such a space.

325
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:25,145
But the thing is that...

326
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,911
See, even if we say
that it's for 3 days,

327
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,144
they will charge one
month rent and...

328
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,585
But that doesn't matter.
- Okay.

329
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,750
You know, we just have to shift
it from my house somehow.

330
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:35,826
Okay. We'll do it quickly.
- Yes.

331
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,225
Thank you very much.
- So should we bury her today itself?

332
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,264
How?
- Not to bury“ Shift! Shift!

333
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:42,197
We have to shift her.

334
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:43,234
We'll do it.

335
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:09,018
What's this, man?
Isn't this an office?

336
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:10,061
Awesome!

337
00:27:14,265 --> 00:27:17,030
Sandra, is that the key
for the Croydon property?

338
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:19,093
Yes.
- Okay. Thank you.

339
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:20,600
The property is ready.

340
00:27:20,672 --> 00:27:23,334
One month rent
would be almost...

341
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:25,739
around 1,600".
- One slap I'll give you.

342
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,070
One month's rent?
What is this, dude?

343
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:29,180
Hey Joy!

344
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:31,348
This is not to settle down as a family.

345
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:34,219
A dead body has to lie there
alone forjust 3 days.

346
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:35,753
Dead body is the problem.
- What?

347
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,811
It doesn't need current or water...

348
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:39,152
Doesn't it need current?

349
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:40,623
Where do we plug in the freezer?

350
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,160
- Oh yes. We need a little
bit of electricity.

351
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:44,321
Bro, I'm just a caretaker.

352
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:45,625
If the owner knows this...

353
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,926
Hey! Don't brag too much.

354
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,363
As if the Sheikh sitting in
Qatar is going to know this.

355
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:53,063
Okay. We'll give you
rent for 10 days.

356
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,230
M
gem

357
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,707
Come, Podiyan. Let's go.
- Don't go. Sit there.

358
00:27:57,976 --> 00:27:59,034
Let's talk.

359
00:28:01,046 --> 00:28:02,013
Tell me.

360
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,310
Something more...

361
00:28:05,817 --> 00:28:06,784
We won't give.

362
00:28:10,722 --> 00:28:11,689
He has reached.

363
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,750
He doesn't come anywhere on time.

364
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,195
Hey Podiyan...

365
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:19,658
Did you take the body out?

366
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,256
We thought we needn't take
the body out from the front.

367
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:22,390
We'll take it out from the back.

368
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,731
From the back?
- That means, from the backside.

369
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,834
It's easier to take it
out from there too.

370
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:28,466
It's going to get late.
- Harry!

371
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,106
Yes.
- Come. - Let's go.

372
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,064
Rest in peace.

373
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:07,370
Careful, careful.

374
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:04,395
What?

375
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,062
Mercy...

376
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,308
Mercy !

377
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,239
Baby, what are you doing?

378
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,447
Mercy...

379
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,849
Come on, look at me.

380
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,912
Listen... We had no other option.

381
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:28,851
We've done the best we can.

382
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:32,951
Moreover, in this atmosphere where
the kids are around, how do we...

383
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,186
Please try to understand and come back.
Let's go there.

384
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,228
Yes.

385
00:31:37,629 --> 00:31:38,619
Sorry.

386
00:31:38,696 --> 00:31:41,427
It's hardly 2 miles from here.
That's all.

387
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,933
One of us would always be there.

388
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:45,993
You can come any time. You have our
number, right? Just give us a call.

389
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,104
Okay.

390
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,372
Thank you.

391
00:31:58,216 --> 00:32:00,241
Hey! I will call you back, okay?

392
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:01,285
Okay.

393
00:32:07,692 --> 00:32:09,353
Is this the Sheikh's place?

394
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,191
Bro, has it been long
since you reached?

395
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:13,060
Talk softly. Don't shout and
let the neighbours know.

396
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,395
A rascal stays next door.
Adifficult bugger.

397
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,264
Hey! Take it inside.

398
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,359
Go, Manoharan!

399
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,403
Come on!
- Me?

400
00:32:19,537 --> 00:32:20,971
Come on.
- Just hanging around.

401
00:32:21,205 --> 00:32:22,172
I'll give you work.

402
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:30,514
Can you please pick up?

403
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,108
Please pick up, Rekha!

404
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,149
Don't hang up!

405
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,321
She hung up!

406
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:40,724
Hey Podiyan!

407
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,021
She's not at all heavy.
- Look over there.

408
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:43,959
Careful.
Come on.

409
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:46,063
What did this aunty eat?

410
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,065
Don't step on those plants.
Careful.

411
00:32:49,534 --> 00:32:51,059
Come on, walk.
- I'm walking!

412
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,467
What is this?
They are carrying a huge box!

413
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,198
I think someone has come
to stay there on rent.

414
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,365
Why are you so shy?

415
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:59,336
I'll drop this, okay?

416
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:01,569
Get inside.
Slowly.

417
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,341
Why do they need such
a big box for that?

418
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,573
Must be the furniture
for the house.

419
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:06,684
That's all.

420
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:09,180
It would have been great if
they were from our place.

421
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:10,321
Why?

422
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,355
Loo k!

423
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:12,583
Why from our place?

424
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,091
That won't be right.
You go inside.

425
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,421
Why are you getting
angry for that?

426
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:20,997
Look in the corner for a
socket to plug this in. -Yes.

427
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,555
Harry, is there supply?

428
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:23,600
Yes. There is supply.

429
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:25,769
Come!

430
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:28,005
Hold this.

431
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,742
Aunty, we've switched on the AC.

432
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:39,010
Sleep happily, okay?

433
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:40,684
Com e.

434
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:46,552
Don't hang up!

435
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:47,624
Don't hang up!

436
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,996
Hey Manoharan...

437
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:54,098
You should go to the airport
early in the morning.

438
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,724
The youngest son is coming
in the Dubai flight.

439
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,234
Pick him up.
You know the flight number, rig ht?

440
00:33:57,301 --> 00:33:58,598
Yes. So who will be here?

441
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,103
Podiyan will stay here.
Won't you?

442
00:34:00,171 --> 00:34:01,536
Why not?
I'll take care.

443
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:04,576
I'm the son of a policeman who stood
guard for so many dead bodies!

444
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,805
That's all right. Don't get drunk, leave
the door open <i>&</i> go. There are foxes here.

445
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,411
Aunty won't be here
in the morning then.

446
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,675
I'll sit next to aunty.
- See you.

447
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:11,715
And yeah...

448
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,717
Don't go.
Buy a bottle and come.

449
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,446
If you can, you also come and sit with me.
- Let's see.

450
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:16,553
Are you leaving?

451
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,549
"My mommy's dangling earrings"
(film song)

452
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:25,392
"My mommy's dangling earrings"
(film song)

453
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:27,428
"Earrings"
- Hey!

454
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:28,832
Come here.

455
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:30,763
2 diamond earrings.

456
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,569
One gold necklace.

457
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,299
A golden rosary and a watch.

458
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:36,340
3 bangles.

459
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,273
Not 3 bangles. There's just one.
- Just one?

460
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,606
All those should be there on her
body even whenl come back.

461
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,112
What is this, bro?
Don't you trust me?

462
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,545
No, Podiyan.
I don't trust you.

463
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,580
"His mommy's dangling
earrings", it seems.

464
00:34:46,284 --> 00:34:48,116
This is so bad.

465
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,778
If something like
this happens once...

466
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,416
then no one would trust us.

467
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,296
Do you want see your mom,
or go to your sister's place?

468
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,194
I want to go see mom first.

469
00:35:24,188 --> 00:35:25,155
Over there.

470
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:36,762
Jomon?
- Yes.

471
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:37,801
Com e.

472
00:35:42,406 --> 00:35:43,373
This way.

473
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,260
Hey!

474
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,296
Come on.

475
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,582
Mom!

476
00:37:10,661 --> 00:37:11,890
Looks like I'm being fooled.

477
00:37:12,463 --> 00:37:13,897
Hey Dixon Lopez!

478
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:16,426
If my salary isn't credited
to my account tomorrow,

479
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,594
I'll get another company
to bury your body!

480
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,534
You heard me?

481
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:21,900
What is it? I can hear someone
crying from the house?

482
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:22,940
What is happening?

483
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,907
Oops! You heard it here?

484
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,243
It's nothing, sister.

485
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,210
Aunty's son has come from Dubai.

486
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,247
When he saw the body, he cried.
That's all.

487
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,009
Body?
Whose body?

488
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,742
Aunty's body is inside.

489
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,217
Her youngest son came from Dubai.

490
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,718
He cried seeing the body.

491
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,491
Natural.
- How can you keep a body here?

492
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,425
Then? Can I keep it there instead?

493
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,461
Shall I keep it there?

494
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:47,361
Oh no! Hey Shiva!

495
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,627
This hag thinks that she won't die.

496
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,732
Hey man! What's happening?

497
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,606
Who is he?

498
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:57,300
What's happening?
- What?

499
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,840
Have you kept a body
inside the house?

500
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:01,810
Well.. I didn't murder anyone
and bring the body here.

501
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,576
I brought her here upon her children's request.
- How can we believe that?

502
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,741
Let me tell you one thing.

503
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,942
It's against the law.

504
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,508
You can't keep a dead body here.

505
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:09,553
Take it to a mortuary.

506
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,952
{mm}?
a

507
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,424
Who are you?
- I'm your bloody neighbour, man!

508
00:38:14,492 --> 00:38:16,290
Neighbour? That's fine.
- Hey Podiyan!

509
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,327
Huh?
- Come here.

510
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:18,453
Come here.
- Come here, I say.

511
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:19,496
Why?

512
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:21,765
What's the problem?

513
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,665
Him <i>&</i> his mother are creating a huge
scene because we've kept the body here.

514
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:25,600
Him?
- Yes.

515
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:27,568
Where is he from?
- India. -Wait.

516
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:29,539
Hey!

517
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,406
How does he know that we've kept
a body in here? -I don't know.

518
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,303
I told him, bro.
- What is this, man?

519
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:36,013
Hey man!

520
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,375
This is a unique situation.

521
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:41,076
Because, that lady passed away...

522
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,852
Her children are all in
different pans of the world.

523
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,286
We can take her out,
only after they come.

524
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:47,290
So what?
I don't give a f###

525
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:49,820
a
IE

526
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:51,094
Hey man!

527
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,361
After all, it's a dead body.

528
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,762
She won't trouble anyone.
She's sleeping peacefully.

529
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,598
Please!
- No way!

530
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,569
Take it away.
- Didn't I tell you? He's a rascal.

531
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:01,605
Go!

532
00:39:02,973 --> 00:39:03,940
Okay!

533
00:39:04,709 --> 00:39:06,074
Okay, relax.

534
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:09,471
Owner of the dead body is coming.
Okay? We'll talk.

535
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:11,015
Okay?

536
00:39:15,386 --> 00:39:17,445
Bro, there's a huge problem here.

537
00:39:17,588 --> 00:39:19,056
There's a problem here.
- What problem?

538
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:22,058
Saying that we've kept a body here..
I think it's that Tamilian's son...

539
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:23,753
He's creating a big fuss!

540
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,625
I wanted to punch him in his gut,
but I let it go thinking about you.

541
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,994
How did they know that
there's a body here?

542
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:29,658
How did they know that?

543
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,931
My dear Sindhukumar, didn't I tell you
that those Tamilians are troublemakers?

544
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:34,437
So? People can't die here or what?

545
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:35,370
Owner!

546
00:39:35,506 --> 00:39:37,031
Owner?
- Owner of the body.

547
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,807
Hi. Rajuchetta, you leave.
I'll deal this.

548
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,576
What, Sharavanan?

549
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:42,805
Hey! I'm not Sharavanan.

550
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,008
I'm Shiva.
- Shiva, then! Come.

551
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:46,116
Come here.

552
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:47,417
You idiot!
- Yes.

553
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,852
Why did you tell them that
there's a body inside?

554
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,785
Bro...

555
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,652
When they asked me why
someone is crying here,

556
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:54,953
I told them about aunty!

557
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,424
What else can I say?
- What?

558
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:57,993
What else can I say?

559
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,788
Why do you have to slap me
for such a small thing?

560
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,439
Hey!

561
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:12,868
I shouldn't have
told them, right?

562
00:40:12,943 --> 00:40:14,775
Yo u...
- Raj u Chettaa...

563
00:40:14,845 --> 00:40:17,712
Nothing will work out.
That rascal is furious.

564
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:21,509
What do we do now?
- How do I know?

565
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,610
Bro, don't you know any other house?
- Me?

566
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:25,655
For this?
Go ask someone else!

567
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,491
There's one place.

568
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,721
Where?
- Which place?

569
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:38,501
There's only one place.

570
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:41,938
Hey!

571
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,140
What happened, man?

572
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:44,902
The immediate neighbour
of that house...

573
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,409
A Tamilian rascal...

574
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,206
He said that he'll complain
to the council <i>&</i> police.

575
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,414
So?

576
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:51,812
We're searching for
another place.

577
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:53,577
But it will take time till
the night to get it ready.

578
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:55,915
Until then, you should adjust this here.
Please.

579
00:40:55,986 --> 00:40:57,545
Shall we take it inside?
Please.

580
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,747
Hey! Take it inside.

581
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,116
Take it inside, Podiyan.
Harry, come on!

582
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:02,922
Don't tell the neighbours.

583
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:04,060
Lift the box!

584
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,217
Tell me.

585
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,544
Dude...
Did you know?

586
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:30,849
Emmy

587
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,580
I'll deal with the Tamilian.

588
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,623
That's better.

589
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:36,560
Or else, I'll take this box
to your house in the night.

590
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,627
That won't be necessary.

591
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:39,095
Good for you then!

592
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,761
This is nothing!

593
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,600
I don't even have a house to keep my own
dead body. That's my situation now!

594
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,252
Go inside, Jomon.
I'll bring the luggage.

595
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,589
Billy of Croydon?
Have you heard of him?

596
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:44,928
No, sir.

597
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:46,997
Harry from Briston?

598
00:42:47,631 --> 00:42:48,598
No, sir.

599
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,297
Sang karane of East Ham?

600
00:42:54,204 --> 00:42:56,138
Or even our Malayali boy,
Kattappana Bobby?

601
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,232
Who are these people, sir?

602
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,971
They are the underworld
princes who rule London.

603
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:04,541
When they are all in my pocket,
this bloody Tamilian...

604
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:05,673
I'm going to rip him apart!

605
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:08,885
What?

606
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,555
What, man?

607
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:12,987
I am Dixon Lopez.

608
00:43:13,891 --> 00:43:14,858
So what?

609
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,060
Just for 2 days...

610
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:20,128
Give us permission to keep
that body in that house.

611
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:21,164
No way!

612
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,292
Don't say no!
- No way!

613
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,828
Is that so?

614
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:38,114
Please.

615
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,317
Please!

616
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:43,720
Please, please!

617
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,115
My sweet-heart!

618
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:48,291
Come on!

619
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,356
Come on!
- Yes boss.

620
00:43:57,234 --> 00:43:59,168
I thought you would
turn violent, sir.

621
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,933
During certain special circumstances,
we have to change our style.

622
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,071
Why did you settle it by
paying Pounds to him, sir?

623
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:07,970
Only both of us need to know
that I paid him money, okay?

624
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:10,176
Raju..
- What's the status?

625
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,941
Bring the item back to this house.

626
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,409
How did you deal with him?

627
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,378
How did I deal with him?

628
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:21,180
Bring back the stuff, man!

629
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,861
He must have paid money!

630
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,628
And he claims to have dealt with him!

631
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:36,906
Hello!

632
00:44:37,074 --> 00:44:38,371
Philip sir?
- Yes.

633
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,103
We're about to reach Terminal 3.

634
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,804
Hello sir. Welcome.
- Thank you.

635
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,315
I've just landed.

636
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:46,781
No. I'm staying at
my sister's place.

637
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:47,976
What do I say?

638
00:44:48,252 --> 00:44:50,380
We're constructing a shopping
mall at Kottayam, right?

639
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:51,979
I've been pumping
all my money there.

640
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,888
It's a 100 Crore project!

641
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:07,801
His family hasn't come.

642
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,167
This is aunty's eldest son.
Philip.

643
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,865
Astingy fellow!

644
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:14,711
More than you?

645
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:31,024
"As death approaches,
please sit by my side for a while"

646
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:32,762
Benny...

647
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:36,232
Hey!

648
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,134
You!!

649
00:45:38,202 --> 00:45:41,001
Who takes salary for the driver's
post from the company? You or me?

650
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,061
His flight was today?

651
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:43,766
I thought it was tomorrow.

652
00:45:43,841 --> 00:45:45,309
Go get his luggage
and keep it in here.

653
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,509
You're becoming quite violent.

654
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,046
How do I open this?

655
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:52,139
I'll show you how to open..
- No. I've opened it.

656
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:58,722
Careful.

657
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,117
Brother"
- Yes?

658
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:05,521
How many children does
this aunty have, altogether?

659
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,992
Six.. No.. Five!

660
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:08,031
Come here, man!
- Coming.

661
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,257
He doesn't know even that.
- Counting her, five.

662
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,902
Lara, be a nice girl, okay?

663
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:13,903
Chechi...

664
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:26,477
Mom!

665
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,020
You left without saying
even a word to me, mom!

666
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:31,054
Ammini...

667
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,486
She has been crying from Canada.

668
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,321
Take me also along.
I'll also come with you!

669
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:40,058
Someone open it. Let me see her.
- Chechi, come here.

670
00:46:41,064 --> 00:46:42,031
Chechi, come.

671
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,999
If you go on like this,
I'll also break down.

672
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:57,410
We don't normally deal
with Malayali families.

673
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,813
They are always stingy
when it comes to billing.

674
00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:01,418
It's very difficult
to handle, you know?

675
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,111
Difficult, it seems.

676
00:47:04,588 --> 00:47:05,885
Negotiation!

677
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,254
But anyone would try out
a negotiation, right?

678
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,020
My dear sir, all of us
want to make it grand.

679
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,390
It shouldn't lack anything!

680
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:14,794
Everyone compares Pounds
with Indian currency.

681
00:47:14,865 --> 00:47:15,991
That's where the problem lies.

682
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:18,860
He'll tap on to their sentiments.

683
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:19,936
This will be intense.

684
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,931
They are your only parents.

685
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:22,870
Just the only ones?

686
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,031
You're spending a little money
for them, for the last time.

687
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,075
No one remembers that.

688
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:31,004
He's looking at you!

689
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,254
Okay.
What's our final bill now?

690
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,251
Jessie, what's the total figure?

691
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,994
Sir, final amount is 15,967.

692
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:47,121
Is it too less?

693
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,995
Just 15,967 Pounds.

694
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:49,997
<i>Wow'!</i>

695
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:52,329
If you quote such a huge amount,
anyone would question it.

696
00:47:52,402 --> 00:47:55,064
My dear sir, since this is a
case that came from Doctor,

697
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,197
we arrived at this rate, after
applying the maximum discount.

698
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:58,469
Decision is yours.

699
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,952
Okay.
Do you need some advance now?

700
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:13,080
10,000 Pounds.

701
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:14,123
Oh. That's all?

702
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,523
Rest, you can pay on the
funeral day morning.

703
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:17,560
Is that so?

704
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:22,065
Ammini...

705
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,265
That's Ammini.

706
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,096
That short one's wife.

707
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:30,367
Me and Anto are so broke that we
can't even contribute to it, mom!

708
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,930
She's crying for that?

709
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,438
Don't be upset.
Mom can understand all that.

710
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,475
Poor thing, right?

711
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,251
Mukundan, give him a cheque.

712
00:48:44,388 --> 00:48:46,618
Me and Benny will transfer
the amount to your account.

713
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,252
He passed it on to
his brother in law.

714
00:48:49,526 --> 00:48:50,891
Of course!

715
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:52,560
Okay.
- Jessie, give me the agreement.

716
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,490
Doctor, you should sign
this agreement yourself.

717
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:57,533
Yeah.

718
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:23,057
10,000 Pounds, right?

719
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:24,455
Yeah.
- Sure.

720
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,154
We need at least 5 priests.

721
00:49:26,229 --> 00:49:28,960
Mom was really fond of
priests and brass band sets.

722
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:32,101
Pm?

723
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,535
Sign this one as well.
- Okay.

724
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:43,046
Monichaya...
- Yes.

725
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:44,408
This is not right.

726
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:45,706
We should bury mom
at our home town.

727
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:46,749
At our home town?

728
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,549
That won't be possible.
- We should.

729
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,710
That was her last wish.

730
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:53,316
Next to dad's grave.
She had told me.

731
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,291
Just because mom said so.
Are you the one who decides this all alone?

732
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,294
You don't need to take any trouble.
I'll take her myself.

733
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,262
For that, what the hell
do you have with you?

734
00:50:00,364 --> 00:50:02,765
He had to beg someone even for
the ticket money from Dubai.

735
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,094
Jomon, us elder sons are
here to take decisions.

736
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,226
Ammini and Kunjumol also.

737
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:07,771
You don't have to be all hyper!

738
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,402
I'm telling you what
mom's wish was.

739
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,999
Kunjumol knows it.
She had promised mom.

740
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:15,545
We make many promises to kids and
old people. That doesn't matter.

741
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,777
Is this like the lousy
Church in Kattappana?

742
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,712
Mom is going to get a royal
funeral here in London.

743
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,252
She will only be happy about it.

744
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,120
Jomon, we've already
signed the agreement.

745
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:26,723
And we've paid the
advance as well.

746
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,315
How can we rethink now?

747
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:34,487
What rethinking?
We've paid 10,000 Pounds already.

748
00:50:34,564 --> 00:50:35,588
Who paid?
- Well...

749
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:37,429
Whoever paid it,
money is money!

750
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,434
You're all bothered
only about money.

751
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:45,135
Yes. We made that money by studying
well, and working hard on our jobs.

752
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:47,506
We didn't waste our time to
end up penniless like you.

753
00:50:47,577 --> 00:50:49,272
We got it because of God's blessings.

754
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:50,311
Will there be a fight?

755
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,677
And he wants to take the
body to Kattappana!

756
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:57,110
You better stay quiet!
Or else, I'll knock your teeth out!

757
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,151
No.
Everyone has reached.

758
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:02,717
It will take 2-3 days.

759
00:51:04,494 --> 00:51:06,485
No. The funeral service
guys are doing everything.

760
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,663
Yeah. I'll call you back.

761
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,058
No. It's okay.
- Nice, rig ht?

762
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:13,164
Who?
- She is the doctor's wife.

763
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:15,471
What is this, man?

764
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,797
Being culture less in a house
where a death has happened.

765
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:19,706
I didn't know that
you became decent.

766
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:21,210
I had given it onthe newspaper.
Didn't you read it?

767
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,507
That's why I didn't know.

768
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,546
That's why.

769
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,649
Podiyan, boss is calling you.

770
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:29,276
Jessie, I've told you several
times not to call me Podiyan.

771
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,053
My name is Sindhukumar.

772
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:32,247
Sheesh!
Chindukumar!

773
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,115
Jessie, you can call him Podiyan.

774
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:36,817
Or he has a nickname from Aalthara
junction. Shall I tell her that?

775
00:51:36,893 --> 00:51:38,793
Please don't say that alone.
- Get lost, Podiyan!

776
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,352
He wants to call my nickname!

777
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:46,195
Yeah.
It's all right.

778
00:51:47,737 --> 00:51:48,704
I'll call you.

779
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:50,465
Okay.
Sure.

780
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:52,642
Hi.

781
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:54,143
Hello.

782
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:57,771
Did aunty have such a wish?

783
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:00,582
To get buried in her home town,
as Jomon said?

784
00:52:01,251 --> 00:52:02,218
What's the point now?

785
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:03,878
That's not going to happen.

786
00:52:04,488 --> 00:52:06,115
Did she say so to you as well?

787
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,793
Yes.

788
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,097
Excuse me.

789
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:29,644
<i>Ram.
- Kunchayan...</i>

790
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,336
What's happening?
- Where are you?

791
00:52:31,414 --> 00:52:33,815
I've come to our
Maringattupalli party office.

792
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:35,345
A small issue.

793
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:36,911
I've come to compromise that.

794
00:52:37,254 --> 00:52:38,221
Where are you?

795
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,623
I've come for a funeral discussion.

796
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:43,384
A Malayali family.

797
00:52:43,593 --> 00:52:45,186
They are from your
mother's home town.

798
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,796
Where?
From Kattappana?

799
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:47,830
Yes.

800
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,525
Who is the one who died?

801
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,260
Is it someone I know?

802
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:53,666
It's an aunty.
Rosamma.

803
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,333
Her children are all abroad.

804
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,531
The youngest boy wants to
get her buried back home,

805
00:52:58,608 --> 00:53:00,133
and the elder ones
are against it.

806
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,338
Do you know their family name?

807
00:53:02,412 --> 00:53:03,436
I don't know all that.

808
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:07,349
The aunty's name is
Rosamma John Chacko.

809
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:10,478
Is her eldest son's name Philip?
The one in America?

810
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,454
Yes. The second son
is in Australia.

811
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:14,751
Oh! It's Rosamma Chedathi.

812
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:18,660
I heard from someone that she had gone to
her younger daughter's place in London.

813
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,955
A mm?

814
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:24,458
John Achayan was such a great man.

815
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:25,535
Even Chedathi...

816
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:28,867
The first two sons are building a
shopping complex in Kottayam now.

817
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,532
I heard that it's a
100 crore project.

818
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:31,574
Jomon!

819
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:32,775
Jomon!

820
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:34,443
Stop there.

821
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:36,275
Listen to me, dear.

822
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:37,745
Kunjumol, you keep quiet.

823
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,582
I can't stay with those
two in the same house.

824
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:42,778
Kunjachaya, the younger one
and his sister are fighting.

825
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:44,845
Shall I hang up?
I'll call you later.

826
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,480
Okay.

827
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:49,759
So sad.

828
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,590
What is happening here, man?

829
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:53,360
It's my house, right?

830
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:03,297
Shall you do me a favour?
- Yes.

831
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,898
Can I get a room in
some hotel here?

832
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,468
Just for 2-3 days.

833
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,869
I need a cheap room.

834
00:54:08,011 --> 00:54:08,978
Jomon!

835
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:11,380
Can you do it?

836
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:14,876
You can get a room.

837
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,684
In this situation,
should you fight and leave?

838
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:18,948
If you can help me, say that.

839
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:21,517
I don't know anyone here.

840
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,527
Okay.
I'll arrange it.

841
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,241
Such difference of opinions
would be there in every house.

842
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:44,274
You must close your
eyes to some of them.

843
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,740
I didn't say that they should
accept my opinion, right?

844
00:54:48,051 --> 00:54:49,280
This was mom's last wish.

845
00:54:49,919 --> 00:54:51,546
Even after knowing
that, they are...

846
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:55,923
They have money. So it's only their
decision that would happen, right?

847
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,059
I know that.

848
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:58,689
But I also can do
certain things.

849
00:54:58,762 --> 00:55:01,629
There's some land that dad had written
in my name, at Kattappana town.

850
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,662
I get calls daily asking
if I'm selling it.

851
00:55:03,767 --> 00:55:06,737
If I make one call to Kerala, money
will come to any account I tell them.

852
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,506
If you help me, I can go to
our home town with my mom.

853
00:55:09,773 --> 00:55:11,537
Money is not the
only issue, Jomon.

854
00:55:12,509 --> 00:55:14,477
Now, your mom is under our
company's protection.

855
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:18,342
We can't give her to anyone other than
the person who signed the agreement.

856
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:25,910
What if things happen as
you and your mom wished?

857
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:28,624
Let's try.

858
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:31,059
Don't sell off your
property in haste.

859
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:37,294
<i>M</i>
mm

860
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,367
But he won't give it.

861
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:41,433
Thank you so much, bro.

862
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,666
I have to get some money
from a chit fund.

863
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:48,107
Once I get that, I'll return this 2000,
along with the earlier 1.5.

864
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,906
I just need the time to
get there from here.

865
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:53,646
I am standing guard
for a dead body here.

866
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:54,750
What do I say!

867
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:55,976
It's a long story.

868
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:57,486
Don't leave, okay?

869
00:55:57,554 --> 00:55:59,318
I'll reach soon, okay?

870
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:00,356
Hey!

871
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:02,091
Where are you going?

872
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:05,585
Bro, I need to go to Maidstone.

873
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,820
I have arranged some cash there.
I need to collect it.

874
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:10,366
There are people left in London
who still lend money to you?

875
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:12,026
Bro, I do return all that, right?

876
00:56:12,102 --> 00:56:13,592
Maximum 3 hours.

877
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,671
Until then if you could stay here,
I'd be really grateful.

878
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,138
Don't take longer than 3 hours.
- No.

879
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:18,704
My bag is in the car.
Bring it.

880
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:20,140
Couldn't you bring it when you came?
- Podiyan!

881
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,637
I just have to bring the bag, right?

882
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,113
I'll bring it.

883
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,990
"There's water"

884
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:36,853
"Where's the glass?"

885
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:52,572
I've kept your bag here.

886
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:53,507
Keep it and get lost.

887
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:55,475
Don't drink the whole thing.
I'll be back soon.

888
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:56,512
Okay.

889
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,709
Don't drink the whole thing?
Who does he think he's talking to?

890
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,477
Oops. Sorry!

891
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:08,457
Hello!

892
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:21,971
Cheers!

893
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,572
It's so cold!
So cold!

894
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:37,186
Hello!

895
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:40,916
I'm Raj u.
Rajagopal.

896
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,555
My full name is
Rajagopalan Narayanan.

897
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:44,660
I'm from Changanassery.

898
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:45,895
Okay?

899
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,494
I know your name, aunty.

900
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:54,197
Rosamma.

901
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:56,797
Rosamma John Chacko.

902
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,467
You should have been lying in the drawing
room of your house in Kattappana,

903
00:58:01,544 --> 00:58:05,242
receiving the prayers for the dead,
and the divine mercy prayer.

904
00:58:06,015 --> 00:58:11,476
And you're lying in this filthy room,
in this lousy house in Croydon?

905
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,224
This is called 'Yogam' (luck), aunty!

906
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,156
Didn't get me?

907
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:19,227
In the language of Nairs of
my town, it's 'Karayogam'.

908
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:23,532
So what?

909
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,536
Your children are throwing money
to give you a grand funeral here.

910
00:58:29,873 --> 00:58:32,467
You need to be lucky
enough for that too!

911
00:58:34,978 --> 00:58:35,945
Look here.

912
00:58:36,746 --> 00:58:37,713
Hello!

913
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:39,879
I can't see you while sitting.

914
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:49,225
Au nty !

915
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:51,822
Au nty !

916
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,621
Hey! I had metJomon.

917
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,098
He really wants to get your
funeral done at your home town.

918
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,100
But poor thing...
He doesn't have any money.

919
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,828
And his elder brothers...

920
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:04,700
He doesn't have the power to
stand against them, as well.

921
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,272
Once you're dead, how does it
matter where you're buried?

922
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,077
I am...

923
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:16,749
lam going to call my wife.

924
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:19,788
There might be some
shouting and cursing.

925
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,051
Please bear with it.

926
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:28,330
"Oh God, I'm praying before you.
Please bless me"

927
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:30,866
Pick up!

928
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:33,235
Pick up!

929
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:36,195
It's ringing...

930
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:38,034
It's ringing...
Pick up!

931
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,769
Where are my munchies?

932
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:42,937
Pick up!

933
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,248
She hung up!

934
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,620
She has WhatsApp, right?

935
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:56,992
Let me try WhatsApp.

936
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,231
Yeah right!

937
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,299
Sweet-heart, it seems!

938
01:00:14,344 --> 01:00:15,937
You idiot!

939
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:20,949
What you're doing now,
is a Himalayan blunder!

940
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:22,982
I'll give you one last chance.

941
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:24,813
You better let me back
inside the house.

942
01:00:25,989 --> 01:00:29,983
Othen/vise, you will have to
pay a huge price for this.

943
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:32,988
Hey! I'm not so
adamant about this.

944
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,188
I can even come back home
today evening if you want.

945
01:00:36,899 --> 01:00:37,866
Hello?

946
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:39,632
A reply...

947
01:00:41,404 --> 01:00:42,872
I'm expecting a reply!

948
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,972
Chocolate!

949
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,332
The reply is here!

950
01:01:14,137 --> 01:01:15,366
Don't expect a reply.

951
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:16,805
Oh!

952
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,338
Don't expect a reply?

953
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,870
Shouldn't I expect a reply?

954
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:25,648
Okay.

955
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:29,009
I'll try a different route.

956
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:36,452
I'll see you soon.
Asmall urination break.

957
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:40,056
(singing an old song)

958
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:56,201
Silence!

959
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,779
Sound recording!

960
01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:00,716
Take 1.

961
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:03,419
Rekha...

962
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,820
Cut! Cut! Cut!

963
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:09,425
My dear Rekha...

964
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:11,093
Take 2.

965
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,953
My dear Rekha...

966
01:02:14,964 --> 01:02:17,456
don't be such a stiff and
rigid straight line...

967
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,163
Shouldn't you bend
and curve at times?

968
01:02:22,205 --> 01:02:25,436
Othen/vise, life would
be so monotonous.

969
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,372
We have only one life.

970
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:30,742
And in that, who knows how
long we're going to live.

971
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:38,017
Have you read Kundera's book
'Unbearable lightness of being'?

972
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:40,153
In that, he says...

973
01:02:49,198 --> 01:02:51,223
That means, 'When death comes...'

974
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,404
Hey Podiyan!

975
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:01,977
You idiot!

976
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,378
No!

977
01:03:59,602 --> 01:04:00,569
Hey Podiyan!

978
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:07,109
You idiot!

979
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,312
No!

980
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:48,350
No!

981
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,041
Oh Christ!

982
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:14,642
It's so damn cold in there.

983
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:24,077
<i>Hey Raw'.!</i>

984
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:25,520
What is it?

985
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,652
<i>Hey Raw'.!</i>

986
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:38,392
Why are you hiding
behind the door?

987
01:05:42,738 --> 01:05:43,715
Come here.

988
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:44,706
No!

989
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:46,235
Come here, I say!

990
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,356
A coat?

991
01:06:34,757 --> 01:06:35,724
Nice!

992
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:38,689
Chocolate!

993
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,358
Hey! I am calling you!

994
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,171
Why are you staring like that?

995
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:29,769
I got out of that box
to sit and talk to you.

996
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,108
What are you drinking?

997
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,679
What is it?

998
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:39,583
Whiskey!

999
01:07:40,222 --> 01:07:41,189
Whiskey!

1000
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,583
When it used to get really
cold in Kattappana,

1001
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:46,651
my husband used to
give me a little.

1002
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,089
It felt really good!

1003
01:07:51,067 --> 01:07:52,262
Fix a drink for me.

1004
01:07:53,469 --> 01:07:56,166
Hey kiddo!
Fix a drink for me, man!

1005
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,436
Hey!
The bottle is over there.

1006
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:25,532
Do you need water?

1007
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:26,792
It's Scotch, right?

1008
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:28,262
Don't pour water.

1009
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:36,501
Bring it here.

1010
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,557
Give it.

1011
01:08:49,225 --> 01:08:50,192
Cheers!

1012
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:08,210
There's no one here.

1013
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,278
There's no one here.

1014
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:14,549
There's no one here!!

1015
01:09:16,218 --> 01:09:20,314
Why does your face have a horrified
expression, as if you've seen the devil?

1016
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,595
So you didn't die?

1017
01:09:32,234 --> 01:09:33,668
I am dead.

1018
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:36,435
Then how are you walking
around like this?

1019
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:39,374
I'll tell you.

1020
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:51,686
Hey!

1021
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:55,753
Death becomes complete...

1022
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:59,227
only after the Vigil for the deceased
is received, the body is buried,

1023
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:00,863
and the grave is
covered with sand.

1024
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,832
This resting posture before that...

1025
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,462
That's not in vain...

1026
01:10:08,003 --> 01:10:10,233
I'm telling this since
I'm fond of you.

1027
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,268
Don't tell anyone else.

1028
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,602
Even if you tell them,
no one would believe you.

1029
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,211
That lying posture...

1030
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:20,715
...is to understand!

1031
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,749
That posture is to understand
everything that's happening around us.

1032
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,746
Truth and righteousness...

1033
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,947
Tears and false tears...

1034
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,192
The real and the fake...

1035
01:10:32,428 --> 01:10:35,989
When I go to the Lord's court,
he will ask me a question!

1036
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:37,589
'Rosam ma'

1037
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,791
'How was the world to you?'

1038
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:42,768
'Family, husband, children'

1039
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:47,603
And depending upon the report
that I give Him up there,

1040
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:51,277
the people down here would
get punished or rewarded.

1041
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:57,452
Yeah right!

1042
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:58,849
I won't believe all this.

1043
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:01,322
Yeah right!
I won't believe all this.

1044
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:03,956
For that, you haven't
died yet, right?

1045
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:05,594
No.

1046
01:11:05,761 --> 01:11:07,752
No dead person has spoken
to you yet, right?

1047
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:09,831
Speak to me?

1048
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:12,496
I'll tell you something
to make you believe me.

1049
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:15,460
What did your wife say?

1050
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,666
'Don't expect a reply'

1051
01:11:19,775 --> 01:11:20,742
Oh no!

1052
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:22,902
How did you hear that?

1053
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,535
Hey kiddo!
- Yes.

1054
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:28,516
I was lying in that box,
listening to everything!

1055
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:31,777
Your Milan Kundera
is not necessary!

1056
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:35,285
For situations like this, Muttathu
Varkey (Malayalam writer) is the best!

1057
01:11:35,557 --> 01:11:36,718
Let that be.

1058
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,687
What was the problem?

1059
01:11:40,562 --> 01:11:41,529
Well, aunty...

1060
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,990
Us men, for some comedy...

1061
01:11:45,334 --> 01:11:46,392
Why?

1062
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:48,266
Women aren't allowed
any comedy, or what?

1063
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:49,371
They are!

1064
01:11:49,738 --> 01:11:50,967
Don't interrupt, aunty!

1065
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:52,870
Don't interrupt.
I don't like that.

1066
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,443
No.
You tell me.

1067
01:11:55,344 --> 01:11:56,311
Well...

1068
01:11:57,046 --> 01:11:58,013
That...

1069
01:11:58,747 --> 01:11:59,873
How do I...

1070
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,483
Can I have a drink, please?

1071
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:04,552
Go ahead.

1072
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,760
What is this, man?

1073
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:19,601
This?

1074
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:22,603
The boys who come for work at Elakkanam
are the ones who drink like this.

1075
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,469
Like how the cow
drinks its gruel.

1076
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,840
It's for a confidence, aunty!

1077
01:12:39,054 --> 01:12:40,021
Well...

1078
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,555
I'm not saying this
because she's my wife.

1079
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:44,717
She is quite okay.

1080
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,463
When I failed in many
businesses and went bankrupt,

1081
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:51,659
it was her, and her salary,
that protected me.

1082
01:12:53,836 --> 01:12:55,133
And that's when...

1083
01:12:55,637 --> 01:12:58,800
I took something that was
lying on a fence in East Ham,

1084
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,070
and kept it in an
unwanted place, aunty!

1085
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:04,772
If you ask me why I did that...
It's because of my loose character!

1086
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:23,889
Hey sweet-heart!
Why are you sitting here like this?

1087
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,127
Aren't you going to the office?

1088
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:26,167
No.

1089
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:27,800
What happened?
Do you have fever?

1090
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:29,037
I don't have fever.

1091
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:30,631
Come on!
What happened?

1092
01:13:30,873 --> 01:13:32,898
Nothing. I'm not going anywhere.
That's all.

1093
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:34,769
Okay.
Then take rest.

1094
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,977
[aim

1095
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:51,119
Raju..
- Yes.

1096
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:54,662
Thank you.

1097
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:56,564
Pen drive?

1098
01:13:57,866 --> 01:13:58,833
What's in this?

1099
01:13:59,134 --> 01:14:00,863
Listen to it in the car, on the way.

1100
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:02,471
Oh! Love songs?

1101
01:14:02,538 --> 01:14:03,699
You'll know when you hear it.

1102
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:06,973
The scene is totally different today!

1103
01:14:08,043 --> 01:14:09,875
I'll listen to it and call you.
- Don't call.

1104
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:10,969
And never come back here.

1105
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:12,639
Hey! Rekha!

1106
01:14:13,215 --> 01:14:14,182
Rekha?

1107
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:15,784
Rekha!

1108
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:18,887
Rekha?

1109
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:46,208
How long will we...

1110
01:14:46,949 --> 01:14:49,941
How long will I romance
this voice alone?

1111
01:14:50,085 --> 01:14:54,215
When are you going to appear
before this poor man's eyes?

1112
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,117
Let it be the right time.

1113
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,227
Well...

1114
01:14:59,595 --> 01:15:01,256
What if you don't like
me when you see me?

1115
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:03,989
Isn't it enough if we romance like
this without seeing each other?

1116
01:15:04,066 --> 01:15:06,501
My darling, I will die.

1117
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:08,967
You know how long it has
been since I slept?

1118
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:11,796
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
- Sheesh.

1119
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:15,635
You should close both the eyes.
Isn't that how you should sleep, darling?

1120
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:17,770
It's all a joke for you, dear.

1121
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:21,744
And, what were you doing
without sleeping last night?

1122
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:22,884
I read.

1123
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,277
Pablo Neruda's poem.

1124
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,214
I've read it several times.

1125
01:15:27,656 --> 01:15:31,115
But yesterday, those lines
acquired a new beauty.

1126
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,820
Have you heard them?
- No.

1127
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,569
I'm not a litterateur or anything.

1128
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,543
Still, I made an attempt.

1129
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:55,078
I translated it into Malayalam.

1130
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:56,683
Really?
- Yes.

1131
01:15:56,785 --> 01:15:58,514
Do you want to hear it?
- Yes.

1132
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:04,191
'I will bring you happy
flowers from the mountains,

1133
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:12,090
bluebells, dark hazels,
and rustic baskets of kisses'.

1134
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:18,331
'I want to do with you what spring
does with the cherry trees'.

1135
01:16:18,707 --> 01:16:19,799
- It's very nice, Sachi.

1136
01:16:19,875 --> 01:16:20,740
A
Em

1137
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:22,002
its
a

1138
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:24,238
- I was going to hang up.
- Don't hang up.

1139
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:26,680
Give me a kiss
before Rekha comes.

1140
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:28,675
- My husband is here.

1141
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:30,545
- Then shall I give you a kiss?

1142
01:16:43,031 --> 01:16:44,089
Oh God!

1143
01:17:10,092 --> 01:17:11,321
Rekha, this is a betrayal!

1144
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:13,191
Awell-planned betrayal!

1145
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,895
In Kerala, it's a called a honey-trap.

1146
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,727
Even a poor minister had
been trapped in this.

1147
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,339
If she is your friend,

1148
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:28,341
she should have told
that to me first.

1149
01:17:29,177 --> 01:17:31,339
Should that cheat encourage me?

1150
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:34,148
Rekha!

1151
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:35,842
Open the door, please.

1152
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:39,654
Give me a chance to talk and
apologize, falling at your feet, dear.

1153
01:17:47,029 --> 01:17:48,656
I feel really weird.

1154
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:51,228
I need to go to the toilet.
Open the door, please.

1155
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:56,328
Okay. I need to take my clothes.

1156
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,137
I need to take my clothes.

1157
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:04,240
I've packed it in a suitcase <i>&</i>
kept it in your car's boot.

1158
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:13,882
Well planned!

1159
01:18:18,060 --> 01:18:20,256
She trapped you nicely, huh?

1160
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:24,098
Laugh softly!

1161
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,228
Neighbours will hear you.

1162
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:29,236
The Tamilian there would
be fast asleep now.

1163
01:18:29,304 --> 01:18:32,831
He must be dreaming
about the Pulisadam,

1164
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:34,899
that his mom used to make
during his childhood.

1165
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,001
Whatever his dream might be!

1166
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:41,040
You're laughing hysterically hearing
the story of a guy's life going for a toss?

1167
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:43,278
Whom were you flirting with,
over the phone?

1168
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:44,977
Is she your wife's friend?

1169
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:47,752
Yes.
- Is she good looking?

1170
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,823
I fell for her voice.

1171
01:18:52,427 --> 01:18:54,862
If I had known that this
was the case initially,

1172
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:57,695
I'd have escaped immediately.

1173
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,961
If a woman makes up her
mind to ruin a man's life,

1174
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,004
it will happen.

1175
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:08,040
Even Rekha knows thatl already have
quite a bad reputation in this.

1176
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:11,841
People say that you're
rich in bad reputation!

1177
01:19:11,913 --> 01:19:14,712
Aunty, are you with me,
or the people?

1178
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:16,284
With you!
- Then what is this?

1179
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:17,418
Hey!

1180
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,817
A mind that is ready to
forgive, matters the most.

1181
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:21,089
If that's there...

1182
01:19:21,156 --> 01:19:26,788
Family life is a business that can be
run only if both of you have that.

1183
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:30,187
Hey!

1184
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:31,289
<i>Do you know?</i>

1185
01:19:31,366 --> 01:19:33,733
A blunder that my husband made.

1186
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:38,166
It was when I had just delivered
my youngest boy, Jomon.

1187
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,774
A distant relative of mine
came for domestic help.

1188
01:19:42,377 --> 01:19:43,344
Kochurani.

1189
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,777
She looks great!

1190
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:47,310
She came home and
stayed with us.

1191
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:48,847
And that stay wasn't so simple.

1192
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:53,050
She pinned the edge of her dress to her
hip, and started ruling the place.

1193
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:58,221
One day, when my husband went
to the bathroom to take bath...

1194
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:00,859
she went behind him,
with a handful of oil.

1195
01:20:01,029 --> 01:20:04,124
Asking him, 'Pappachaya, don't you
want to apply oil on your head?'

1196
01:20:06,601 --> 01:20:07,796
What is it?

1197
01:20:10,005 --> 01:20:10,972
What?

1198
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:12,832
'It' must have happened!

1199
01:20:15,177 --> 01:20:19,080
My husband came crying and told
me everything that happened.

1200
01:20:20,215 --> 01:20:21,774
I asked him only one thing.

1201
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,352
'Would you carry her in your heart?'

1202
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,348
When he said no...

1203
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:28,812
I trusted him.

1204
01:20:30,392 --> 01:20:33,191
And he never broke that trust.

1205
01:20:34,062 --> 01:20:35,359
That's what I was saying...

1206
01:20:35,931 --> 01:20:37,592
That there should be forgiveness.

1207
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,960
It's because you are
in this form...

1208
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:43,438
Otherwise, I'd have put you
in my car and taken you home,

1209
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,974
and made you narrate this
Kochurani story to my wife.

1210
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:50,304
Aunty, can you talk
to her on the phone?

1211
01:20:51,079 --> 01:20:52,342
<i>Hey Raw'.!</i>

1212
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:57,041
If an old hag calls her and talks
to her at this midnight hour,

1213
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:59,382
wouldn't that be an
even bigger problem?

1214
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,289
Everything will be all rig ht, son.

1215
01:21:01,556 --> 01:21:03,388
Just that it will take a few days.

1216
01:21:06,094 --> 01:21:07,391
I really hope so.

1217
01:21:09,664 --> 01:21:11,894
You should listen to my complaint.

1218
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:15,426
Complaint of the dead!
Tell me!

1219
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,636
At the cemetery of our
Church in Kattappana,

1220
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,202
right next to the grave
where my husband rests"

1221
01:21:21,276 --> 01:21:23,574
My only desire was to rest there.

1222
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:25,640
And my children are
plotting against it now.

1223
01:21:26,081 --> 01:21:28,049
Have you seen the
cemeteries here?

1224
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:30,247
You know how awesome they are?

1225
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:32,543
If you see them, anyone
would feel like dying once.

1226
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,518
They are so beautiful.

1227
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:35,556
Hey!

1228
01:21:35,957 --> 01:21:37,948
Receiving the Vigil for the
deceased in Malayalam,

1229
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:40,957
That too, should be done
by Father Kanavasshery...

1230
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:43,429
Where my husband rests...

1231
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:45,899
In the soil that he
became a pan of...

1232
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:48,026
To rest there is like...

1233
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:51,300
Isn't that the only place
where I would be at peace?

1234
01:21:51,573 --> 01:21:52,540
Au nty !

1235
01:21:52,607 --> 01:21:55,872
If I lie here amidst these
foreign Sahebs and Madams...

1236
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:58,206
I will only be crying in pain.

1237
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,073
How do we do it, aunty?

1238
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:03,379
It will happen only according to
your children's decisions, right?

1239
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,181
That decision should change.

1240
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:08,514
I want to go to Kattappana.

1241
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:09,682
Well...

1242
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:13,185
If you were alive,
I'd have bought a ticket for you.

1243
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:15,890
There are tickets for
the dead too, right?

1244
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:19,263
You will be able to buy it.

1245
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:22,935
My dear son...

1246
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,533
To take someone who forgot their
way home, back to their house...

1247
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:33,346
Won't you be kind-hearted
enough to do that?

1248
01:22:36,551 --> 01:22:39,213
Consider that I am your mother.

1249
01:22:55,136 --> 01:22:56,968
Whom do I tell this to, aunty?

1250
01:22:57,605 --> 01:23:01,132
To Lopez, who's happy that he
got a great business offer?

1251
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,344
Or to your children, who want
to make this function grand?

1252
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:06,972
My dear Rajagopalan...

1253
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,647
Away would open up before you.
I'm sure.

1254
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,948
Aunty, you're asking
help to an orphan,

1255
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:18,152
who was chased away from his own
house, by his wife and Pablo Neruda?

1256
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:20,752
If you support me
to get this done...

1257
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:22,360
I swear on Pareppalli Church!

1258
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,455
There will be a solution
to your issue as well.

1259
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:26,466
How?
Tell me a way!

1260
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:28,036
Tell me a way!

1261
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:32,107
You should go there somehow,

1262
01:23:32,407 --> 01:23:35,001
and kneel down before her,
with folded hands.

1263
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:38,310
I've knelt down,
with folded hands.

1264
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,711
Then you should cry
really loudly!

1265
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:45,710
What is this?

1266
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:48,421
This sounds like a fox howling.

1267
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,682
Cry sincerely.

1268
01:23:51,226 --> 01:23:52,557
I'll cry over there.

1269
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,058
I'll cry really loudly.

1270
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:57,631
She should accept whateverl say.

1271
01:23:58,833 --> 01:24:01,325
Then she would kick
you with her knee!

1272
01:24:02,070 --> 01:24:03,162
Like this!

1273
01:24:03,671 --> 01:24:04,638
Rekha!

1274
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:09,343
No!

1275
01:24:11,780 --> 01:24:12,747
No!

1276
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:17,218
Who is it?

1277
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:18,619
Bro!

1278
01:24:18,686 --> 01:24:20,381
What are you doing?

1279
01:24:20,855 --> 01:24:21,822
Podiyan?

1280
01:24:22,424 --> 01:24:24,756
When did you come?
- I just came.

1281
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,537
Hey!

1282
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:38,330
Who all are here now?

1283
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:41,375
You, me and this aunty.

1284
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:43,776
What's the matter?

1285
01:24:45,880 --> 01:24:47,712
Aunty was here all this while.

1286
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:49,478
I was talking to her.

1287
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:50,518
What?

1288
01:24:52,454 --> 01:24:54,320
You finished the whole bottle?

1289
01:24:54,522 --> 01:24:55,853
If you drink one full bottle,

1290
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:59,186
not just this aunty, you'd feel like
you've talked to the aunty's mom as well.

1291
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:03,221
Stop it.
Just get up.

1292
01:25:03,698 --> 01:25:04,665
Get up!

1293
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:09,433
Hey! Go to sleep.
Here's your key.

1294
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,471
Hold it.

1295
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:12,404
I swear! Aunty was talking to me.

1296
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:14,571
With aunty? -Yes.
You talked?

1297
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:15,800
I believed it.

1298
01:25:15,877 --> 01:25:17,402
So as we said, okay?

1299
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:19,441
Young girls don't talk to us!

1300
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:21,346
And you're saying that
aunty spoke to you!

1301
01:26:04,526 --> 01:26:06,324
What is all this, aunty?

1302
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:34,548
If you support me to
get this done...

1303
01:26:34,722 --> 01:26:36,383
I swear on Pareppalli Church!

1304
01:26:36,524 --> 01:26:38,424
There will be a solution
to your issue as well.

1305
01:27:17,298 --> 01:27:18,265
Rekha!

1306
01:27:21,769 --> 01:27:22,736
Good morning!

1307
01:27:27,842 --> 01:27:28,809
Hey!

1308
01:27:28,876 --> 01:27:31,709
That aunty's husband,
Mr. John Chacko...

1309
01:27:32,046 --> 01:27:34,879
He wasn't just speaking on the
phone with another woman.

1310
01:27:34,949 --> 01:27:37,611
He got the full action done!

1311
01:27:37,952 --> 01:27:38,919
Look at me.

1312
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:43,446
Realizing that it was
Kochurani's initiative,

1313
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:47,923
that aunty understood that the poor
man made a mistake, and forgave him.

1314
01:27:48,596 --> 01:27:50,223
Rekha!
Rekha!

1315
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,024
Please!
Please!

1316
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:54,898
Rekha, please!

1317
01:27:54,969 --> 01:27:57,438
Please! A mind to forgive each other.

1318
01:27:57,538 --> 01:28:02,669
A business that can be run only
if both the parties have that.

1319
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:03,877
That's family life.

1320
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,477
This was said by
experienced people.

1321
01:28:07,448 --> 01:28:09,439
Please, dear.
Open the door, please.

1322
01:28:11,352 --> 01:28:12,478
Please, dear.
Open the door.

1323
01:28:14,522 --> 01:28:15,990
Come on!
Let us talk!

1324
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:17,424
Come on!

1325
01:29:37,905 --> 01:29:41,466
You traitor, who got your own
husband into a honey trap!

1326
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:42,976
You know what should
be done with you?

1327
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,103
Even in the international
court of Feminists,

1328
01:29:45,179 --> 01:29:47,011
this case of mine
would get a bail.

1329
01:29:47,081 --> 01:29:48,571
Later they will acquit
me as well.

1330
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:49,707
Domestic violence.

1331
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:52,544
One phone call is enough.
The police will reach here.

1332
01:29:53,121 --> 01:29:54,088
Want to go to jail?

1333
01:29:54,922 --> 01:29:56,117
You want to go to jail?

1334
01:29:57,592 --> 01:29:58,616
No.

1335
01:29:58,826 --> 01:29:59,793
Then get going-

1336
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:04,388
I'm going.

1337
01:30:04,599 --> 01:30:05,566
Just one thing.

1338
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:08,429
Soon, my dead body will reach here.

1339
01:30:09,804 --> 01:30:11,101
So, take it back
to my Kerala...

1340
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,564
I don't need the 'Aivar Madham'
cremation services and all that.

1341
01:30:13,641 --> 01:30:16,576
You should have the heart to cremate
me somewhere back in my home town.

1342
01:30:16,644 --> 01:30:18,043
Okay.
I'll do that.

1343
01:30:27,588 --> 01:30:29,522
Pablo Neruda's bloody @%@%

1344
01:30:38,466 --> 01:30:41,094
Hey! I went to meet Rekha
and made an attempt.

1345
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:43,767
That didn't work out.

1346
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,607
Now I'm going for your matter.

1347
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:49,572
I need to catch hold of Kunjumol's
husband, that Nair from Palakkad.

1348
01:30:49,744 --> 01:30:51,610
You should stand with me, okay?

1349
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:12,600
Doctor?
- Yes.

1350
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:13,700
Oh my God!

1351
01:31:13,901 --> 01:31:14,868
Shall I sit here?

1352
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:16,629
Yeah. Please sit.
- Thank you.

1353
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:20,833
I don't think you recognized me.

1354
01:31:21,075 --> 01:31:22,975
I am Raju.
Rajagopalan Nair.

1355
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:25,103
From Dixon Lopez funeral service?
- Yes! Yes!

1356
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:28,171
I couldn't identify suddenly.. What's
happening with the funeral preparations?

1357
01:31:28,249 --> 01:31:29,683
We're planning it all very well.

1358
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:31,115
We're trying for day after tomorrow

1359
01:31:31,185 --> 01:31:33,483
We need to get a couple of permissions.
- That's good.

1360
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:37,214
Your home town is
in Palakkad, right?

1361
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:40,051
Yes. A small village.
It's called Nenmara.

1362
01:31:40,127 --> 01:31:42,061
Nenmara.
I've come there. Vall...

1363
01:31:42,129 --> 01:31:44,097
Vallangy Vela"
- Yes.

1364
01:31:44,165 --> 01:31:46,657
I have some friends in Palakkad.
- Oh Okay.

1365
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,493
Doctor"
Or leave it...

1366
01:31:51,305 --> 01:31:52,704
Well, doctor, do you...

1367
01:31:52,773 --> 01:31:53,740
What is it?
Tell me.

1368
01:31:53,808 --> 01:31:55,640
Doctor, do you believe in spirits?

1369
01:31:56,310 --> 01:31:57,471
Swim?

1370
01:31:57,578 --> 01:31:58,977
Spirit. Our soul.

1371
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:00,480
Do you believe in it?
- Of course, yes.

1372
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:01,640
Definitely.

1373
01:32:01,716 --> 01:32:06,483
Well, us people from the Nair community
have certain beliefs and traditions.

1374
01:32:06,554 --> 01:32:08,716
I asked that because you
needn't believe in all that.

1375
01:32:08,789 --> 01:32:11,087
No. I believe them.
I am a believer.

1376
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:13,189
In my ancestral house,

1377
01:32:13,761 --> 01:32:17,095
Wu
Em

1378
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:20,166
My maternal house is in..
This Pazhoor Padippura?

1379
01:32:20,234 --> 01:32:21,668
Yes.
- Have you heard of it?

1380
01:32:21,736 --> 01:32:23,898
Of course.
- It's a little to the south from there.

1381
01:32:23,971 --> 01:32:26,565
You know, even our family has
a lot of faith in astrology.

1382
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:27,802
We consult them regularly.

1383
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:29,307
So what I was about to say...

1384
01:32:29,744 --> 01:32:31,712
I can say that confidently.
- Yes. Tell me.

1385
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:33,742
My uncle...

1386
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:36,580
<i>Em</i>
E

1387
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:41,121
So I just randomly discussed this
death that happened at your house,

1388
01:32:41,355 --> 01:32:43,983
and the present situation there,
with my uncle.

1389
01:32:44,258 --> 01:32:46,124
Don't feel bad when I ask this.
- Ybs?

1390
01:32:47,061 --> 01:32:48,961
Are you from the Ezhava caste, doctor?

1391
01:32:49,263 --> 01:32:50,697
Sheesh.
I am a Nair.

1392
01:32:52,266 --> 01:32:53,825
My uncle told me.

1393
01:32:53,935 --> 01:32:57,166
That's the only possibility.

1394
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:59,832
So I'll confidently say
what my uncle told me.

1395
01:32:59,907 --> 01:33:00,874
Tell me, please.

1396
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:03,267
One thing that he told was that...

1397
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:06,013
What is it?
Tell me.

1398
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:10,282
Elm

1399
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:13,209
Did she have any last wish?

1400
01:33:14,322 --> 01:33:18,281
Had she told anyone to take her body to
her home town to get it buried there?

1401
01:33:18,359 --> 01:33:20,225
Yes! She had a last wish.

1402
01:33:20,294 --> 01:33:23,161
She had actually told that
to my wife, Mrs. Mercy.

1403
01:33:23,764 --> 01:33:25,289
Then I'll tell you the rest
of what my uncle told me.

1404
01:33:25,366 --> 01:33:26,765
Tell me, Rajagopal.

1405
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:29,562
This is a belief among us Hindus.

1406
01:33:30,071 --> 01:33:32,870
I don't know if it would be
acceptable to Christians.

1407
01:33:33,908 --> 01:33:35,342
If this wish of hers doesn't happen,

1408
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,308
that soul wouldn't attain salvation.

1409
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:43,347
That soul will constantly create different
kinds of troubles in that house.

1410
01:33:43,417 --> 01:33:44,612
I see.

1411
01:33:44,685 --> 01:33:47,279
It will specially affect
the husband and kids.

1412
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:49,722
You know... What we can do...

1413
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:53,658
Its logic or its scientific basis...

1414
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:57,656
Or even it's applicability...
I don't know all that. -Yeah.

1415
01:33:57,732 --> 01:34:00,724
MERE
mm

1416
01:34:00,801 --> 01:34:04,362
Fortunately, it might be God's wish,
that I saw you in here.

1417
01:34:04,438 --> 01:34:07,169
You know, Mr. Rajagopal,
the problem is...

1418
01:34:07,241 --> 01:34:09,209
I'm not the one who
should decide that.

1419
01:34:09,276 --> 01:34:10,641
I am only the son in law.

1420
01:34:10,711 --> 01:34:12,645
Apart from supporting
what her children say...

1421
01:34:12,713 --> 01:34:13,703
All that's correct.

1422
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:16,011
But why do you have to
deliberately do something,

1423
01:34:16,083 --> 01:34:18,211
that would bring harm to you
and your children, doctor?

1424
01:34:18,285 --> 01:34:20,219
Right you are.
- Why don't you talk to your mom?

1425
01:34:20,287 --> 01:34:22,949
Mom had actually told me this.
That this should be handled very carefully.

1426
01:34:23,024 --> 01:34:26,119
Mothers are like that. They will speak
only for the well being of their children.

1427
01:34:26,193 --> 01:34:28,355
Anyway, I was able to
say this to you, right?

1428
01:34:30,064 --> 01:34:31,759
<i>Okay, Docmr.</i>

1429
01:34:31,832 --> 01:34:33,994
I'm getting down at
the next station.

1430
01:34:34,068 --> 01:34:35,229
I'm also getting down there.

1431
01:34:35,936 --> 01:34:37,335
You're getting down here?
Okay.

1432
01:34:37,738 --> 01:34:39,365
If you need anything,
just call me, Doctor.

1433
01:34:39,473 --> 01:34:41,134
I'll get down and
call my mother.

1434
01:34:41,409 --> 01:34:43,969
I'll give you my number.
Whatever you need, just call me.

1435
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:50,415
There's a talk in Kerala that us Nairs
don't care for each other. - Oh no!

1436
01:34:50,484 --> 01:34:52,213
We should change that.
- Of course.

1437
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,428
Oh Lord Vigneshwara!
Bless us.

1438
01:35:04,231 --> 01:35:05,960
It's the moon sign.
It can be harmful.

1439
01:35:07,101 --> 01:35:09,035
Look.
Unni is calling.

1440
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:36,261
Doctor!
- Mr. Raj u!

1441
01:35:36,430 --> 01:35:37,488
My car is over there.

1442
01:35:37,732 --> 01:35:39,029
You know what's a coincidence?

1443
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:42,400
Whenl called home,
our family astrologer was there.

1444
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,405
So he also said the same
things that you said, Raju.

1445
01:35:45,473 --> 01:35:47,999
He will, sir.
Astrology is a science!

1446
01:35:48,142 --> 01:35:50,406
It's a secret pride
for us Hindus.

1447
01:35:50,978 --> 01:35:53,948
Go straight home and tell your
Christian brothers in law,

1448
01:35:54,014 --> 01:35:55,345
to take their mom to Kattappana
and bury here there.

1449
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:57,009
I'm going to say it right away.

1450
01:35:57,084 --> 01:35:58,415
Call me once you tell them.
- Sure.

1451
01:35:58,486 --> 01:36:03,356
My number is 778739532.
- 778739532.

1452
01:36:03,958 --> 01:36:05,255
M! mum
E

1453
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:07,453
No. 5321.
- 5321. Okay.

1454
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:09,189
Okay. Thank you.
- Okay. Thanks.

1455
01:36:10,231 --> 01:36:11,255
Bye! Bye!

1456
01:36:11,365 --> 01:36:12,730
Bye!
- Bye!

1457
01:36:15,836 --> 01:36:16,928
Move, you baldy!

1458
01:36:17,004 --> 01:36:18,301
Where is this Jomon?

1459
01:36:18,839 --> 01:36:19,965
No news from him.

1460
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,873
Elm

1461
01:36:23,077 --> 01:36:24,772
This is why he's not
doing well in life.

1462
01:36:25,246 --> 01:36:27,180
Ammini, is the pork ready?

1463
01:36:27,314 --> 01:36:29,976
Yes. Here.
Don't shout, man!

1464
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,519
Your Cholesterol is so high, and you're
thinking about pork all the time.

1465
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:35,954
Don't say that, Ammini. I think about pork
only when I'm not thinking about you.

1466
01:36:36,023 --> 01:36:36,990
Give it here.

1467
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:39,790
Well, brother...
Do you get good buffalo meat in Sydney?

1468
01:36:39,994 --> 01:36:41,428
Not as much as Canada.

1469
01:36:41,495 --> 01:36:42,462
Oh!

1470
01:36:43,798 --> 01:36:45,129
How come you're late today, Doctor?

1471
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:47,534
Shall I get you a drink?

1472
01:36:47,601 --> 01:36:49,296
No! I don't drink
during the day.

1473
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:51,462
If you're drinking, you
should drink during the day.

1474
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:53,098
It keeps you going for the
whole day, right bro?

1475
01:36:53,174 --> 01:36:54,164
Hey Philip!

1476
01:36:55,142 --> 01:36:56,405
I wanted to say something.

1477
01:36:56,477 --> 01:36:57,808
What is it?

1478
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,039
Hey! It's a matter of belief.

1479
01:37:00,114 --> 01:37:01,081
Matter of beef?

1480
01:37:01,148 --> 01:37:03,810
No! It's a matter of belief.
- Belief!

1481
01:37:04,084 --> 01:37:07,884
Well, mom wanted to be
buried at her home town,

1482
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:10,185
in case something happens to
her while she's here, right?

1483
01:37:10,257 --> 01:37:13,283
So if she departs without
fulfilling that wish,

1484
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:15,829
I doubt whether her soul
would attain salvation!

1485
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:17,430
Salvation?

1486
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,527
That's your Hindu concept, Mukundan.

1487
01:37:21,602 --> 01:37:23,127
We don't follow that.

1488
01:37:23,204 --> 01:37:25,605
It's not that.
The death happened in my house, rig ht?

1489
01:37:25,873 --> 01:37:29,309
So our family might have
a bad effect, is what...

1490
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:30,866
ma;
a

1491
01:37:30,945 --> 01:37:32,208
Doctor, according to our belief,

1492
01:37:32,279 --> 01:37:36,580
if we bury her at a Church cemetery after
all the prayers, it's over. That's all.

1493
01:37:36,650 --> 01:37:39,210
Even othen/vise, your Hindu
set-up is quite bad!

1494
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:42,847
Burning a corpse, and immersing
its ashes into a river? Sheesh!

1495
01:37:42,923 --> 01:37:45,187
And if there's any harm, it would
affect us children only, right?

1496
01:37:45,259 --> 01:37:46,988
Us sons-in-law are safe, doctor!

1497
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:48,187
Well, I just said my opinion.

1498
01:37:48,262 --> 01:37:49,491
Fix another drink.

1499
01:37:52,099 --> 01:37:53,567
What Olavakkodan Nair is he?

1500
01:37:53,667 --> 01:37:55,328
Not Olavakkodu.
Isn't he from Nenmara?

1501
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:56,860
Right?

1502
01:37:57,605 --> 01:38:00,267
I wanted to say something
to you, Monichayan.

1503
01:38:00,341 --> 01:38:03,402
Mattam Chackochayan's son Jijo had
asked, if he could get somejob,

1504
01:38:03,477 --> 01:38:06,276
in the shopping complex that
you're building in Kottayam.

1505
01:38:07,081 --> 01:38:09,243
Ammini, Benny and I had already decided,

1506
01:38:09,316 --> 01:38:12,013
not to give jobs to relatives
and family friends there.

1507
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:14,316
A professional group
is going to manage it.

1508
01:38:14,388 --> 01:38:16,550
We won't interfere in anything.
Even in matters of the staff.

1509
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:19,150
Many people are calling me for this.
I needn't accept their calls, right bro?

1510
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:21,923
No.
- We've spent so much money, right?

1511
01:38:22,363 --> 01:38:25,128
Moreover, who's worthy of
being trusted, in our family?

1512
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:28,130
We also made a mistake like that.
- Is that so?

1513
01:38:28,502 --> 01:38:31,062
When?
- Don't grin. He's talking about you.

1514
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:32,496
Well, Pork...
- Huh?

1515
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:34,667
I mean, Ammini..
The pork hasn't been cooked fully.

1516
01:38:34,909 --> 01:38:36,638
It will be cooked
properly in your tummy!

1517
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,075
Oh! Digestion!

1518
01:38:44,018 --> 01:38:45,042
Doctor Mukundanunni.

1519
01:38:45,686 --> 01:38:48,053
Aunty, your Nair son-in-law.

1520
01:38:49,456 --> 01:38:51,083
Oh my Gods of Perunna,

1521
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:54,050
I hope the Nair has won
over all the Christians.

1522
01:38:54,728 --> 01:38:56,093
Hello Doctor!

1523
01:38:56,363 --> 01:38:57,660
No way, Rajagopal.

1524
01:38:57,965 --> 01:38:59,330
They are not
agreeing in any way.

1525
01:39:00,067 --> 01:39:02,229
Its
Eta

1526
01:39:02,436 --> 01:39:04,905
And total ignorance
about our Hinduism.

1527
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:05,939
What can we do?

1528
01:39:06,140 --> 01:39:07,505
I can't fight against it.

1529
01:39:09,043 --> 01:39:10,272
Okay. Thank you.

1530
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:16,416
It flopped!

1531
01:39:18,986 --> 01:39:21,717
I played the caste card, knowing
that it's a dirty game.

1532
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:25,387
In front the Central Travancore
Achayans (Christians),

1533
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:27,526
the Palakkadan Nair is nothing!

1534
01:39:29,163 --> 01:39:31,029
Why did you get her married to him?

1535
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:35,090
What's the point in
blaming your son in law?

1536
01:39:35,169 --> 01:39:36,295
Your children are the trouble makers.

1537
01:39:42,042 --> 01:39:43,339
Mocking with your smile?

1538
01:39:44,378 --> 01:39:45,345
Au nty !

1539
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:47,610
It's my imagination, right?

1540
01:39:50,284 --> 01:39:51,445
Had you smiled?

1541
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:54,454
"O. right?

1542
01:40:12,072 --> 01:40:13,062
Yes, Raju Chetta.

1543
01:40:13,574 --> 01:40:14,541
I'm outside.

1544
01:40:15,809 --> 01:40:17,004
I'll come.

1545
01:40:17,644 --> 01:40:18,611
That's okay.
I'll reach.

1546
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:21,014
Okay.

1547
01:40:24,818 --> 01:40:28,254
Jomon, nothing is going to work
through straight channels.

1548
01:40:28,722 --> 01:40:31,248
And your brother-in-law?
Anto?

1549
01:40:31,458 --> 01:40:33,654
From Canada?
I'm going to meet him.

1550
01:40:34,328 --> 01:40:35,625
After I meet him,
he will call you.

1551
01:40:35,763 --> 01:40:38,130
I'll tell you what you should
tell him then. - Okay.

1552
01:40:44,471 --> 01:40:46,269
Where are you in
Changanasshery, Rajuchayan?

1553
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:47,738
I am from Mudukkummoodu.

1554
01:40:48,075 --> 01:40:49,736
It's a place where
you get great beef.

1555
01:40:49,843 --> 01:40:50,810
I don't eat beef.

1556
01:40:51,045 --> 01:40:53,241
What kind of a Catholic
doesn't eat beef?

1557
01:40:53,313 --> 01:40:54,280
Com e.

1558
01:40:59,553 --> 01:41:01,078
My house is near Pareppalli.

1559
01:41:01,288 --> 01:41:03,484
My uncle was the driver to the
Archbishop of Perumthottam.

1560
01:41:03,624 --> 01:41:06,525
The Archbishop is my mother's father's...

1561
01:41:06,627 --> 01:41:07,594
No! No!

1562
01:41:07,761 --> 01:41:08,785
Her first cousin!

1563
01:41:08,862 --> 01:41:11,422
Its

1564
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:13,257
I didn't say what I came to say.

1565
01:41:13,367 --> 01:41:16,064
Tell me. Along with that, order a
beer as well. - That will come.

1566
01:41:16,737 --> 01:41:20,367
Your wife's ancestral
property in Kattappana...

1567
01:41:20,774 --> 01:41:22,640
Whom does it belong
to, in the will?

1568
01:41:24,111 --> 01:41:27,172
My dear Rajuchaya, we were hoping that
it will be written in Ammini's name.

1569
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:29,682
Did any of us think that the
lady would die so soon?

1570
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:32,515
Though she said that she will get the will
written, it's not officially on paper.

1571
01:41:32,586 --> 01:41:33,815
Then it's officially on paper.

1572
01:41:34,288 --> 01:41:36,518
IE
E

1573
01:41:38,659 --> 01:41:40,457
I had met Jomon.

1574
01:41:41,895 --> 01:41:45,490
I got an indication that
aunty had written in a will,

1575
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:48,433
that the house <i>&</i>
property will go to him.

1576
01:41:48,502 --> 01:41:49,833
How is that possible?

1577
01:41:49,903 --> 01:41:51,098
Didn't I tell you?

1578
01:41:51,238 --> 01:41:54,538
I just got a clue while
talking to that boy.

1579
01:41:55,442 --> 01:41:56,534
If that is correct,

1580
01:41:57,344 --> 01:41:58,812
it will be trouble for you,
dearAnto!

1581
01:41:58,879 --> 01:42:01,678
Even though the person is dead,
if it's written on a will,

1582
01:42:01,748 --> 01:42:03,409
it's equal to a registration.

1583
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:05,111
What kind of a Catholic are you?

1584
01:42:12,192 --> 01:42:14,684
Take me home as soon as possible.
I need to tell this to my Ammini.

1585
01:42:14,761 --> 01:42:16,855
Sit down. What are you going
to do by running there?

1586
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:18,657
That won't solve this.

1587
01:42:19,266 --> 01:42:21,758
Decide to go back to
Kerala with aunty's body.

1588
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:25,135
Jomon is ready for it.
Kunjumol will also come along.

1589
01:42:25,772 --> 01:42:31,370
You go there, and search aunty's room or
the attic or somewhere for such a paper...

1590
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:33,246
If you find it,
just tear it off.

1591
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:36,374
Since they have decided that the funeral
is here, how can we go to Kerala now?

1592
01:42:36,450 --> 01:42:39,351
Dear Anto, what if Jomon goes to
Kerala without waiting for the funeral?

1593
01:42:39,419 --> 01:42:40,614
If he goes?
- If he goes?

1594
01:42:40,687 --> 01:42:42,553
What if he goes and this
will reaches his hand?

1595
01:42:42,623 --> 01:42:44,387
That will be trouble.
- Yes. That will be trouble.

1596
01:42:44,458 --> 01:42:47,519
My dearAnto, I'm saying this
because we're from the same Parish.

1597
01:42:47,761 --> 01:42:52,130
We already have a bad name that one
Catholic cannot stand another one.

1598
01:42:52,199 --> 01:42:53,598
We should change that.

1599
01:42:54,701 --> 01:42:55,862
Shall I tell you a truth?

1600
01:42:56,637 --> 01:42:58,571
As far as I've noticed,

1601
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:03,143
you're the only one with some honour
and pedigree, in that family.

1602
01:43:03,310 --> 01:43:04,744
Do it only if you want to.
Drink!

1603
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:09,438
One more beer, please.

1604
01:43:10,918 --> 01:43:12,317
What is this, man?

1605
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:22,451
If that's the case, we
should go to Kerala,

1606
01:43:22,529 --> 01:43:24,930
find that will that mom
wrote &tear it off.

1607
01:43:24,998 --> 01:43:26,329
So should we go to Kattappana?

1608
01:43:26,400 --> 01:43:28,368
We should.
You don't open your mouth.

1609
01:43:28,435 --> 01:43:30,403
I'll deal this.
Come.

1610
01:43:32,873 --> 01:43:35,706
Hi lqbal..
That one acre of land behind our site...

1611
01:43:35,776 --> 01:43:36,937
You should get it somehow.

1612
01:43:37,010 --> 01:43:39,638
In future, if there are parking problems,
that's the only way out.

1613
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:42,280
I'll pass the phone to Monichayan.
It's Iqbal.

1614
01:43:44,484 --> 01:43:45,610
What's happening there, man?

1615
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:47,353
Okay.

1616
01:43:47,688 --> 01:43:50,749
No one else should know this. If they
hear this, they will increase the price.

1617
01:43:50,824 --> 01:43:51,791
Yes.

1618
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:54,293
We'll get it done, man.
I'll call you later.

1619
01:43:55,629 --> 01:43:58,792
Hey! Monichayan <i>&</i> Bennychayan shouldn't
become upset when I say this.

1620
01:43:58,865 --> 01:44:00,424
Why don't you say something
that won't upset us?

1621
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:01,661
Bennychaya, it's not a joke.

1622
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,601
We should conduct mom's
funeral at Kattappana.

1623
01:44:03,670 --> 01:44:05,764
No one took it seriously
when Jomon said that.

1624
01:44:06,006 --> 01:44:07,474
I feel it should
be done like that.

1625
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:09,270
Kunjumol, don't you
have the same opinion?

1626
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:10,401
How come suddenly?

1627
01:44:10,477 --> 01:44:11,967
We've made all the
arrangements here, right?

1628
01:44:12,045 --> 01:44:14,946
I'm feeling sad, ever since I came
to know that mom had such a wish.

1629
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:16,608
Enough of this fake
sentiments, Ammini.

1630
01:44:16,850 --> 01:44:19,217
Anto, what's the problem?
Say the truth.

1631
01:44:19,586 --> 01:44:20,610
That's better, Am mini.

1632
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:22,951
Let's say the truth.
They are not strangers, rig ht?

1633
01:44:23,590 --> 01:44:24,887
You both had promised that...

1634
01:44:24,958 --> 01:44:27,450
you'd give the house <i>&</i> property
in Kattappana to me, right?

1635
01:44:27,527 --> 01:44:28,995
Kunjumol doesn't have any
objection in that as well.

1636
01:44:29,062 --> 01:44:30,552
Who raised an objection now?

1637
01:44:30,631 --> 01:44:32,827
No one said so. That's true.
But a betrayal has happened.

1638
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:34,765
Mom wrote a will without
informing anyone.

1639
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:37,503
Saying that the ancestral
property belongs to Jomon.

1640
01:44:37,571 --> 01:44:38,595
Who said that to you?

1641
01:44:38,672 --> 01:44:41,437
There's a guy called Raju from
the funeral company, right?

1642
01:44:41,775 --> 01:44:42,742
Who's that?

1643
01:44:42,809 --> 01:44:43,799
I know him.

1644
01:44:43,877 --> 01:44:46,471
He spoke to Jomon and
got to know about it slyly.

1645
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:48,872
This Raju is a Catholic
from Changanasshery.

1646
01:44:48,949 --> 01:44:50,417
He's a close relative
of the Archbishop.

1647
01:44:50,484 --> 01:44:52,851
If Jomon finds that
will that mom wrote...

1648
01:44:54,988 --> 01:44:56,285
Anto, just call him.

1649
01:44:56,356 --> 01:44:57,619
The Father?
- No. The son.

1650
01:44:57,691 --> 01:44:59,523
Jomon!
- What for?

1651
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:01,894
Call him.
I'll tell you what you have to ask him.

1652
01:45:04,298 --> 01:45:05,060
Hey baby.

1653
01:45:05,632 --> 01:45:07,862
What the F is happening?
- I have no idea.

1654
01:45:10,037 --> 01:45:11,266
Jomon..
- Yes.

1655
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:13,397
It's Antochayan.
- What is it, Achaya?

1656
01:45:13,940 --> 01:45:15,635
You're doing good, right?

1657
01:45:15,742 --> 01:45:16,766
Get to the point, man!

1658
01:45:17,110 --> 01:45:20,512
Jomon, our ancestral property
in Kattappana" -Yes.

1659
01:45:20,580 --> 01:45:25,814
Do you have any idea about mom
writing it in someone's name?

1660
01:45:25,886 --> 01:45:27,581
She hasn't told me anything.
- Is that so?

1661
01:45:27,721 --> 01:45:30,281
Did you hear anything
about mom writing a will,

1662
01:45:30,357 --> 01:45:32,689
or writing that property
in anyone's name?

1663
01:45:32,759 --> 01:45:33,783
No.
- No?

1664
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:40,095
Has she given any indication about giving
that ancestral property to someone?

1665
01:45:40,434 --> 01:45:44,428
The only thing that she told me,
related to the property was that...

1666
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:45,471
Yes. Yes?

1667
01:45:45,939 --> 01:45:46,963
Yes. Tell me.

1668
01:45:47,040 --> 01:45:48,098
What did she say?

1669
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:49,810
When I went home last time,

1670
01:45:49,876 --> 01:45:51,935
mom had said that she would
like to see me married,

1671
01:45:52,012 --> 01:45:54,071
and staying in our
ancestral home with kids.

1672
01:45:56,883 --> 01:45:58,908
Did she say that?
- Yes. She did.

1673
01:45:59,152 --> 01:46:01,416
What is it, Achaya?
- You hang up then, dear.

1674
01:46:01,788 --> 01:46:03,017
I'll call you later.

1675
01:46:05,058 --> 01:46:08,050
I am sure. If mom had said that,
consider it gone!

1676
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:11,063
Dad had written 2 acres of land in
Kattappana town, in his name, right?

1677
01:46:11,131 --> 01:46:12,394
Then why does he need this as well?

1678
01:46:12,466 --> 01:46:14,628
If mom has written such a will...

1679
01:46:14,701 --> 01:46:15,896
It's equal to a registration.

1680
01:46:15,969 --> 01:46:17,733
Kunjumol, get the suitcase
that mom brought from home.

1681
01:46:17,804 --> 01:46:19,670
If this is true, the stamp
paper would be in there.

1682
01:46:19,740 --> 01:46:20,901
Yes.
Let's check that.

1683
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:28,715
Move, Kunjumol.

1684
01:46:32,586 --> 01:46:33,610
Open it.

1685
01:46:39,025 --> 01:46:39,992
Shucks!

1686
01:46:49,503 --> 01:46:50,800
Dad! In between all this!

1687
01:47:04,017 --> 01:47:05,485
There's nothing in here.

1688
01:47:05,719 --> 01:47:07,153
Then it will definitely be
there at our Kattappana house.

1689
01:47:07,220 --> 01:47:09,450
Ammini &I are going to
Kattappana today itself.

1690
01:47:09,523 --> 01:47:11,617
You needn't go there.
If it's there, we can find out.

1691
01:47:11,691 --> 01:47:12,852
Why don't we call Mathukkutty?

1692
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:14,087
Care-taker Mathukkutty?

1693
01:47:14,161 --> 01:47:15,560
If he finds it...

1694
01:47:15,796 --> 01:47:17,389
You keep quiet.
- You come with me.

1695
01:47:18,465 --> 01:47:20,160
Did mom come here with
only one suitcase?

1696
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:22,566
<i>Yes.
- Hey'. Come.</i>

1697
01:48:21,695 --> 01:48:24,721
Why are they conducting
aunty's funeral in London?

1698
01:48:24,965 --> 01:48:26,194
For their convenience.

1699
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:27,829
That's really sad.

1700
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:30,233
It is because of that
Philip's stubbornness.

1701
01:48:30,804 --> 01:48:32,602
It's not stubbornness.
It's his arrogance.

1702
01:48:34,741 --> 01:48:36,709
It's Philip.
That scoundrel will live a 100 years.

1703
01:48:38,278 --> 01:48:39,255
Hello Philip Achaya...

1704
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:40,246
Math ukkutty...

1705
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:41,647
Where are you?

1706
01:48:41,748 --> 01:48:42,806
I am at the plantation.

1707
01:48:43,817 --> 01:48:45,683
I'm spraying pesticides
on the cardamom plants.

1708
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,477
- Go home immediately.

1709
01:48:47,554 --> 01:48:48,521
Give it to me.

1710
01:48:48,922 --> 01:48:51,016
Call Advocate Sabu from
Vazhakkala, when you go.

1711
01:48:51,224 --> 01:48:52,658
And what should I do?

1712
01:48:52,826 --> 01:48:54,988
You go there.
Rest I'll call Sabu and tell him.

1713
01:48:55,061 --> 01:48:56,222
Okay then.
- Okay.

1714
01:49:46,846 --> 01:49:48,075
Get me that box.

1715
01:49:57,624 --> 01:49:58,921
What are you searching for, Sabu?

1716
01:49:59,192 --> 01:50:01,160
You can ask that to Philip Achayan.

1717
01:50:01,227 --> 01:50:02,786
Why?
For him to swear at my mom?

1718
01:50:04,698 --> 01:50:05,665
There's no other box?

1719
01:50:05,765 --> 01:50:08,029
No. Aunty had only this cupboard.
There are no other boxes.

1720
01:50:10,236 --> 01:50:11,704
Shall I keep these back?
- Yes.

1721
01:50:18,812 --> 01:50:19,779
Shall I close it?

1722
01:50:20,046 --> 01:50:21,013
Yes.

1723
01:50:21,147 --> 01:50:22,171
Achaya, it's me, Sabu.

1724
01:50:23,016 --> 01:50:26,975
There's no such document or will
in aunty's box or cupboard.

1725
01:50:27,053 --> 01:50:28,782
Not in her suitcase
or her cupboard?

1726
01:50:28,855 --> 01:50:29,947
No!

1727
01:50:32,759 --> 01:50:34,227
Okay, Sabu.
I'll call you.

1728
01:50:34,394 --> 01:50:35,384
There's nothing there.

1729
01:50:35,629 --> 01:50:37,256
What's the name of that
funeral service guy?

1730
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:39,355
Dixon Lopez.
- Not that. The guy with the slant.

1731
01:50:39,432 --> 01:50:40,297
Slanted one is Raju.

1732
01:50:40,433 --> 01:50:41,764
He was just playing a trick.

1733
01:50:41,835 --> 01:50:43,064
He was the one who took
Jomon from here, right?

1734
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:45,366
Yes. - It's a trick to get
the funeral done at Kerala.

1735
01:50:45,438 --> 01:50:46,667
What's his interest in this?

1736
01:50:46,740 --> 01:50:48,071
He must have fallen for
Jomon's sentiments.

1737
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:50,610
Why should he have the sentiments
that her children don't have?

1738
01:50:50,677 --> 01:50:52,771
There's another thing.
I had called Jaison in Changanasshery.

1739
01:50:52,846 --> 01:50:55,679
He said that there's no such Raju,
related to the Archbishop.

1740
01:50:55,782 --> 01:50:57,978
Benny... I think we must meet him then.

1741
01:51:01,354 --> 01:51:02,913
Let everything happen
as per the plan.

1742
01:51:03,089 --> 01:51:05,114
{mm}
Mm

1743
01:51:05,191 --> 01:51:07,717
What is it, sir?
- This guy? Your staff, Raju?

1744
01:51:07,794 --> 01:51:09,228
Raju is not my staff.
He's my partner.

1745
01:51:09,295 --> 01:51:11,923
Partnership is between you.
We needn't know all that.

1746
01:51:11,998 --> 01:51:12,988
What a partner!

1747
01:51:13,066 --> 01:51:15,967
He's indirectly trying to spoil a
business that your agency received.

1748
01:51:19,305 --> 01:51:20,272
What happened?

1749
01:51:20,473 --> 01:51:24,068
He's doing some fraud operations
along with our younger brother.

1750
01:51:26,413 --> 01:51:29,781
See! We will decide where to
conduct our mother's funeral.

1751
01:51:29,883 --> 01:51:30,850
Yes, of course.

1752
01:51:31,284 --> 01:51:33,685
Our younger brother Jomon
said something foolish.

1753
01:51:33,820 --> 01:51:35,686
And this guy is behind him,
to help him out.

1754
01:51:37,691 --> 01:51:40,217
We don't understand what the hell
his interest in this matter is!

1755
01:51:40,293 --> 01:51:43,854
He's spreading lies about a fake will,
to make us fight between ourselves.

1756
01:51:43,930 --> 01:51:45,728
He even lied that he's a Catholic.
This Nair!

1757
01:51:46,733 --> 01:51:48,667
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

1758
01:51:48,735 --> 01:51:50,760
But just tell me what you want.
I'll arrange that.

1759
01:51:50,837 --> 01:51:52,999
Nothing. He shouldn't
interfere in anything,

1760
01:51:53,073 --> 01:51:54,837
until this funeral ceremony is over.

1761
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:02,242
Othen/vise, we will have to
approach another agency.

1762
01:52:03,283 --> 01:52:04,876
We'll forget about
the money we paid!

1763
01:52:04,951 --> 01:52:07,045
W?
Emits

1764
01:52:07,120 --> 01:52:08,884
No. Nothing of that son
would be necessary.

1765
01:52:08,955 --> 01:52:10,684
Raju won't be pan of
the scene hereafter.

1766
01:52:16,129 --> 01:52:17,096
I can promise that.

1767
01:52:17,363 --> 01:52:18,353
That's good.

1768
01:52:18,732 --> 01:52:20,291
Forus"
And your firm, as well.

1769
01:52:25,205 --> 01:52:26,172
Harry"

1770
01:52:26,406 --> 01:52:27,373
Yes, sir.

1771
01:52:31,911 --> 01:52:32,878
Last one.

1772
01:52:34,948 --> 01:52:36,006
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1773
01:52:48,294 --> 01:52:49,784
Okay, Philip sir.
- Bye.

1774
01:53:01,875 --> 01:53:03,172
It's not your mom
who died, right?

1775
01:53:03,843 --> 01:53:04,833
Then what the hell...

1776
01:53:04,911 --> 01:53:07,175
Didn't a mother give birth to you?
- I won't be born othenwise, right?

1777
01:53:07,247 --> 01:53:10,547
When I see people like you, I wonder
whether you sprouted out yourself!

1778
01:53:11,518 --> 01:53:12,485
Are you leaving?

1779
01:53:12,852 --> 01:53:14,320
I'll come back,
when it's time!

1780
01:53:16,022 --> 01:53:16,989
Don't

1781
01:53:49,589 --> 01:53:53,184
You do realize the struggles
I'm going through, right?

1782
01:53:55,428 --> 01:53:57,829
I tried out all the
fraud games I know.

1783
01:53:59,065 --> 01:54:00,931
But nothing is working out, aunty.

1784
01:54:06,139 --> 01:54:08,233
I'm scared whetherl would fail.

1785
01:54:09,976 --> 01:54:11,137
Please forgive me,

1786
01:54:12,145 --> 01:54:14,011
if that's how this is going to end.

1787
01:54:20,553 --> 01:54:22,817
When the death is not your own...

1788
01:54:24,157 --> 01:54:27,559
By own, I mean when it's not your
near and dear ones who have died...

1789
01:54:28,261 --> 01:54:31,128
I've always felt that there's a
cenainjoy generated in humans.

1790
01:54:31,664 --> 01:54:33,962
A relief that the loss
is not for himself.

1791
01:54:35,001 --> 01:54:36,093
Isn't that true, aunty?

1792
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:40,901
Haven't you seen people rushing to
houses where a death has occurred?

1793
01:54:41,641 --> 01:54:45,305
You know how excited they are to fake
grief, and start their philosophy?

1794
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:51,383
But no one really goes to a house where a
wedding happens, where everyone is happy.

1795
01:54:51,451 --> 01:54:52,941
No one takes initiative
to go there.

1796
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:56,917
They didn't come home and invite..
They left the invitation at the door-step...

1797
01:54:56,990 --> 01:54:57,957
There are a hundred complaints!

1798
01:55:02,962 --> 01:55:04,396
This how people are, aunty!

1799
01:55:04,464 --> 01:55:07,490
But why aren't your own children able
to understand what their mother wants?

1800
01:55:08,268 --> 01:55:10,930
Don't they realize that they also
have to lie like this one day,

1801
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:12,335
and their bodies which were
the proof of being alive,

1802
01:55:12,405 --> 01:55:14,032
should be part of
the earth someday?

1803
01:55:18,711 --> 01:55:21,874
My mother left this earth,
when she was almost as old as you.

1804
01:55:22,916 --> 01:55:24,281
She had many desires.

1805
01:55:24,384 --> 01:55:26,045
Many sights she wished to see!

1806
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:27,587
Many words she was
waiting to hear!

1807
01:55:28,655 --> 01:55:30,282
That poor thing didn't
get any of that.

1808
01:55:33,226 --> 01:55:34,694
That debt which I couldn't repay...

1809
01:55:35,495 --> 01:55:40,990
I thought I would repay it,
through you, Rosamma aunty!

1810
01:55:42,035 --> 01:55:43,002
But...

1811
01:55:50,710 --> 01:55:52,701
Well.. Kunjachayan is calling.

1812
01:55:55,048 --> 01:55:56,209
Let me attend it and come.

1813
01:56:28,548 --> 01:56:30,209
Yeah!

1814
01:56:35,488 --> 01:56:36,455
Au nty !

1815
01:56:37,090 --> 01:56:39,024
You made Kunjachayan
call me, right?

1816
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:42,226
Wait <i>&</i> watch!
This will work!

1817
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:44,521
This will work!

1818
01:56:44,998 --> 01:56:46,693
Hey! Drive to the
municipal office.

1819
01:56:47,400 --> 01:56:48,367
I have to go there.

1820
01:57:10,757 --> 01:57:11,724
Namaste sir.

1821
01:57:12,425 --> 01:57:13,483
Sit down.

1822
01:57:14,060 --> 01:57:16,654
Soman, is Balachandran inside?
- Yes, sir.

1823
01:57:16,729 --> 01:57:17,753
Come with me.

1824
01:57:25,505 --> 01:57:26,802
Balachandran!

1825
01:57:27,206 --> 01:57:28,230
Thomas sir?

1826
01:57:28,307 --> 01:57:29,706
Then what?
- Please sit, sir.

1827
01:57:30,343 --> 01:57:31,504
You also sit.

1828
01:57:32,211 --> 01:57:33,474
How have you been?

1829
01:57:33,746 --> 01:57:35,339
Going on like that...

1830
01:57:35,415 --> 01:57:38,476
And Balachand ran, I
need a favour from you.

1831
01:57:38,618 --> 01:57:39,585
From me?

1832
01:57:39,685 --> 01:57:41,278
Yes.
- Tell me.

1833
01:57:41,354 --> 01:57:43,186
That is..
Hey Philip!

1834
01:57:43,256 --> 01:57:45,088
Both of you step outside
and close that door.

1835
01:57:48,494 --> 01:57:49,461
Make it fast.

1836
01:58:01,774 --> 01:58:03,401
Isn't all that okay?
- Yes sir.

1837
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:06,070
How come people from the municipality
are coming in the morning?

1838
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:08,447
They had come for an
inspection even last week.

1839
01:58:08,848 --> 01:58:10,213
Why have they come again?

1840
01:58:21,094 --> 01:58:22,061
Biju...

1841
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:26,289
What is it, sir?
Suddenly?

1842
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:30,368
What's the matter, sir?
- I don't know.

1843
01:58:58,764 --> 01:59:00,596
You didn't say what the matter is, sir.
- Hey!

1844
01:59:00,900 --> 01:59:03,164
This damn thing was built
up on a marsh land,

1845
01:59:03,302 --> 01:59:06,602
by paying bribes to Sp
many people, right?

1846
01:59:06,739 --> 01:59:08,503
If this building falls down tomorrow,

1847
01:59:08,574 --> 01:59:10,599
you know who would end up
with sand in their mouth?

1848
01:59:10,810 --> 01:59:12,107
This is to avoid that.

1849
01:59:12,178 --> 01:59:14,306
And, the piling is not at all proper.
- Piling is proper, sir.

1850
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:15,905
It had gone through
many inspections.

1851
01:59:16,149 --> 01:59:17,480
The officers before
you had checked.

1852
01:59:17,550 --> 01:59:18,847
Don't narrate those
stories to me.

1853
01:59:18,918 --> 01:59:21,285
Philip, who's in America, owns this, right?
- Yes sir.

1854
01:59:21,354 --> 01:59:22,719
Philip sir, and his brother
who's in Australia.

1855
01:59:22,788 --> 01:59:24,756
Ask them both to come.

1856
01:59:24,857 --> 01:59:27,792
I'll submit this report to
the municipality in 2 days.

1857
01:59:28,194 --> 01:59:30,595
If he comes, it will
be good for Philip.

1858
01:59:30,796 --> 01:59:31,763
He knows me.

1859
01:59:31,931 --> 01:59:33,330
Tell him that I'm
MR Ramachand ran,

1860
01:59:33,399 --> 01:59:35,766
who studied in Kothamangalam
MA Engineering college with him.

1861
01:59:35,835 --> 01:59:36,893
He would know me.

1862
01:59:36,969 --> 01:59:38,903
Sir, Philip sir <i>&</i> his
brothers are in London.

1863
01:59:38,971 --> 01:59:40,496
Their mom died over there.

1864
01:59:40,573 --> 01:59:42,132
All that's correct.

1865
01:59:42,208 --> 01:59:43,937
If they don't come here immediately,

1866
01:59:44,310 --> 01:59:46,677
around a 100 crore Rupees would
drown in this marsh.

1867
01:59:46,746 --> 01:59:47,838
Got it?
- Sir, that...

1868
01:59:55,955 --> 01:59:56,922
Bring it here.

1869
01:59:59,559 --> 02:00:00,526
Pen...

1870
02:00:07,867 --> 02:00:09,835
What is this, sir?
- Stop memo.

1871
02:00:10,203 --> 02:00:12,467
Sir.. - It's a stop memo, to
stop the construction work.

1872
02:00:12,538 --> 02:00:14,302
Sir, that..
- All of you, get into the car.

1873
02:00:14,373 --> 02:00:15,340
Susheelan, start the car.

1874
02:00:16,375 --> 02:00:17,865
Sir! Sir!

1875
02:00:17,977 --> 02:00:19,411
Let me talk..
- Move away.

1876
02:00:22,815 --> 02:00:23,782
Shall we leave?

1877
02:00:29,288 --> 02:00:30,278
It's Iqbal.

1878
02:00:30,356 --> 02:00:31,824
Monichayan, put it
on speaker mode.

1879
02:00:32,258 --> 02:00:33,555
I need to say something to Iqbal.

1880
02:00:33,859 --> 02:00:34,724
What's happening?

1881
02:00:34,860 --> 02:00:36,521
The funds must have reached
the account, right?

1882
02:00:36,596 --> 02:00:37,893
It's not that, sir.
There was another problem.

1883
02:00:38,364 --> 02:00:39,854
You always have some problem.

1884
02:00:39,999 --> 02:00:41,728
What is it, now?
Tell me. Benny is with me.

1885
02:00:41,801 --> 02:00:44,532
Sir, an engineer had come from the
municipality to inspect the site.

1886
02:00:44,604 --> 02:00:45,594
He was really furious.

1887
02:00:45,871 --> 02:00:47,737
He gave us a stop memo.

1888
02:00:47,873 --> 02:00:49,204
We will have to stop the work.

1889
02:00:52,945 --> 02:00:54,936
Stop the work?
- But what's the problem there?

1890
02:00:55,014 --> 02:00:57,244
Sir, he said that there's
some problem in the piling.

1891
02:00:57,316 --> 02:00:58,613
The building is slanted, it seems.

1892
02:00:58,884 --> 02:01:01,012
He'll submit the report to
the municipality in 2 days.

1893
02:01:01,420 --> 02:01:03,320
He said we might have
to demolish it mostly.

1894
02:01:03,456 --> 02:01:04,855
Sir, you should
find some solution.

1895
02:01:05,424 --> 02:01:07,415
What solution can we find
while we're in London?

1896
02:01:07,493 --> 02:01:09,461
Stuff whatever he
needs, into his mouth.

1897
02:01:09,528 --> 02:01:10,586
It's his trick to get money.

1898
02:01:10,663 --> 02:01:12,529
No, sir. He won't
take a single penny.

1899
02:01:12,598 --> 02:01:13,565
He's really strict.

1900
02:01:15,001 --> 02:01:16,662
He said that he knows
you, Philip sir.

1901
02:01:16,736 --> 02:01:17,862
He said that he was with you

1902
02:01:17,937 --> 02:01:20,338
while you studied at Kothamangalam
Engineering college.

1903
02:01:20,406 --> 02:01:21,635
What's his name?
- Balachandran.

1904
02:01:21,707 --> 02:01:23,505
He was in the civil branch.
Do you remember him?

1905
02:01:23,909 --> 02:01:25,673
Oh! That guy from Thrisshur!
Is it him?

1906
02:01:25,878 --> 02:01:27,346
Yes.
- He was troublesome even then.

1907
02:01:27,413 --> 02:01:29,541
Sir, it would be better if you
both could come down quickly.

1908
02:01:29,615 --> 02:01:30,707
He said that as well.

1909
02:01:30,850 --> 02:01:33,512
What if we come? - If you come
here, we can meet him in person...

1910
02:01:34,053 --> 02:01:35,817
That's not necessary.
That's all his ego.

1911
02:01:35,888 --> 02:01:38,858
Wait, Iqbal. Let me see what I can
operate without coming there.

1912
02:01:38,924 --> 02:01:40,756
Okay sir.
- Then what!

1913
02:01:40,993 --> 02:01:43,428
See how easily he's asking
us to demolish the building!

1914
02:01:43,496 --> 02:01:44,691
His damn piling!

1915
02:01:44,764 --> 02:01:46,858
We should be trying to
make him stop saying that.

1916
02:01:47,700 --> 02:01:48,997
What do we do now, Monichaya?

1917
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:52,896
Let me try calling the MP, Jose.

1918
02:01:53,673 --> 02:01:55,664
If you have to convince
engineer Balachandran,

1919
02:01:55,941 --> 02:01:58,774
you must come here with Benny,
Philip Chettan.

1920
02:01:58,878 --> 02:02:01,006
I'll arrange a meeting.
What say?

1921
02:02:01,547 --> 02:02:03,538
Jose, it's our mother's
funeral day after tomorrow.

1922
02:02:03,616 --> 02:02:06,278
The necessity is ours.
And we don't have time as well.

1923
02:02:06,952 --> 02:02:09,444
Things would depend upon the
report that he's preparing.

1924
02:02:10,489 --> 02:02:13,322
So you're saying that we
must definitely come there?

1925
02:02:13,893 --> 02:02:14,860
Yes.

1926
02:02:15,461 --> 02:02:17,361
If you come, it would
take hardly two hours.

1927
02:02:18,064 --> 02:02:20,032
I'll talk to him and
arrive at a compromise.

1928
02:02:20,733 --> 02:02:23,532
These Government officers have this...
You know, right?

1929
02:02:24,337 --> 02:02:26,066
Let's just show him some respect,

1930
02:02:26,539 --> 02:02:27,938
and get our things done.

1931
02:02:28,074 --> 02:02:29,337
Okay.

1932
02:02:29,408 --> 02:02:31,342
Let me consult with Benny.
- Okay.

1933
02:02:35,481 --> 02:02:36,607
Isn't that enough, Kunjachaya?

1934
02:02:38,117 --> 02:02:39,482
More than enough!

1935
02:02:43,556 --> 02:02:46,958
Monichaya, there are 2 tickets available
to Kochi, at 12.30 PM day after.

1936
02:02:47,026 --> 02:02:48,585
Shall I buy them?
- Buy it!

1937
02:02:49,428 --> 02:02:51,658
So if you both are going
to Kerala day after,

1938
02:02:51,731 --> 02:02:53,529
why don't we conduct
the funeral there?

1939
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:55,465
Now you'll be in Kerala,
and the funeral will be here.

1940
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:57,093
If someone asks where
her elder sons are?

1941
02:02:57,169 --> 02:02:59,103
Will you return the money
we paid as advance here?

1942
02:02:59,171 --> 02:03:01,469
I didn't pay it.
Those who paid should get it back.

1943
02:03:01,774 --> 02:03:03,333
Then what?
- Will he return it?

1944
02:03:03,542 --> 02:03:05,636
Let's try asking him.
- We should ask him.

1945
02:03:39,845 --> 02:03:41,472
Yes! Dixon Lopez!

1946
02:03:42,014 --> 02:03:43,709
Dixon Lopez,
this is me, Benny.

1947
02:03:43,949 --> 02:03:46,441
Benny! What a girl, man!

1948
02:03:47,753 --> 02:03:50,518
Benny! Benny!
Our mother's funeral case...

1949
02:03:50,856 --> 02:03:52,824
Hello... Sir.. Benny...
Benny sir!

1950
02:03:52,958 --> 02:03:55,950
Tell me. - There has been a
slight change in our programme.

1951
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:58,591
Oh no! What?
Everything is set for day after.

1952
02:03:58,664 --> 02:04:00,393
I'll pass the phone
to my elder brother.

1953
02:04:00,466 --> 02:04:01,433
Okay.

1954
02:04:01,767 --> 02:04:02,734
Dixon...

1955
02:04:02,802 --> 02:04:05,999
We've arrived at a decision to take
mom's body to Kerala and bury it there.

1956
02:04:06,138 --> 02:04:07,663
Oh no! Why such a change in plan?

1957
02:04:08,808 --> 02:04:10,071
There's an emergency situation,

1958
02:04:10,142 --> 02:04:12,167
for which we have to reach
Kerala immediately. That's why.

1959
02:04:12,244 --> 02:04:14,110
We called you...
I'll pass the phone to Benny.

1960
02:04:14,747 --> 02:04:15,714
Okay.

1961
02:04:16,916 --> 02:04:19,180
Well, the 10,000 Pounds
we paid as advance...

1962
02:04:19,552 --> 02:04:20,519
Come here, girl!

1963
02:04:21,554 --> 02:04:23,545
Yes. The advance?
- You will return it, right?

1964
02:04:23,722 --> 02:04:25,156
When can we expect it?

1965
02:04:25,257 --> 02:04:26,224
To return it?

1966
02:04:27,059 --> 02:04:32,623
I'll release the body only if you hand
over the balance amount as well, to me.

1967
02:04:34,200 --> 02:04:35,964
What nonsense are you saying?

1968
02:04:36,202 --> 02:04:40,036
My dear sir, my words and
actions are all like that.

1969
02:04:40,506 --> 02:04:42,065
Or else, your Doctor brother-in-law...

1970
02:04:42,141 --> 02:04:44,735
The one who signed an
agreement with my company!

1971
02:04:44,977 --> 02:04:46,172
He will be trapped!

1972
02:04:48,013 --> 02:04:49,606
He has a good reputation, right?

1973
02:04:49,682 --> 02:04:51,616
Why do you want to send the
poor man to the court?

1974
02:04:51,684 --> 02:04:54,847
So you won't return it?
- Not like that. I'll return the body.

1975
02:04:55,187 --> 02:04:59,124
After I get the entire balance
amount that I'm supposed to receive.

1976
02:04:59,625 --> 02:05:03,994
Then you can take the body, bury it or
play with it, or do whatever you want!

1977
02:05:05,631 --> 02:05:06,655
Okay then!

1978
02:05:10,836 --> 02:05:13,168
He is trying to teach
prayers to the Pope.

1979
02:05:13,239 --> 02:05:14,934
Who is it?
- You don't have to know that.

1980
02:05:15,007 --> 02:05:16,202
Come here.
Come on, dance!

1981
02:05:17,977 --> 02:05:20,207
That rascal is not going to
return the money he has taken.

1982
02:05:20,279 --> 02:05:22,577
He won't return the body
unless we pay the balance too.

1983
02:05:22,648 --> 02:05:24,639
What do we do?
The stuff is with him, right?

1984
02:05:24,717 --> 02:05:26,276
This is all because
of your wife was adamant.

1985
02:05:26,519 --> 02:05:28,886
'Don't keep it in a mortuary.
Keep it somewhere else!'

1986
02:05:28,954 --> 02:05:31,286
Did you realize how difficult it is to
tolerate your sister now? - Shut up!

1987
02:05:31,524 --> 02:05:33,151
When I'm going crazy here...

1988
02:05:33,692 --> 02:05:35,956
Benny, shall we bury it here itself?

1989
02:05:36,061 --> 02:05:37,028
That's what.

1990
02:05:37,162 --> 02:05:38,721
We spent a lot of money here.

1991
02:05:38,797 --> 02:05:41,164
And if we have to bury her in Kerala,
it will cost that much more.

1992
02:05:41,233 --> 02:05:43,793
Hey! You're leaving by
noon day after, right?

1993
02:05:43,903 --> 02:05:46,838
Let's have the funeral in the morning.
So you can attend it and go.

1994
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:48,905
Right, bro?
- Do one thing.

1995
02:05:48,974 --> 02:05:50,635
You call him.
- Yes. Call him.

1996
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,734
Call him.

1997
02:05:56,649 --> 02:05:58,845
Not like that.
Like this"

1998
02:05:59,084 --> 02:06:00,074
Like this!

1999
02:06:04,356 --> 02:06:05,881
One second, honey.

2000
02:06:06,225 --> 02:06:07,852
Yes, Dixon Lopez.

2001
02:06:07,993 --> 02:06:08,858
It's Philip.

2002
02:06:08,994 --> 02:06:10,052
Tell me, sir.

2003
02:06:10,129 --> 02:06:13,258
We should conduct the funeral
here itself, as per the plan.

2004
02:06:13,332 --> 02:06:16,029
Okay. - That too, day after
morning between 9 <i>&</i> 9.30 AM.

2005
02:06:16,268 --> 02:06:18,566
Me and my brother have a
flight to Kerala at 12.30 PM.

2006
02:06:18,704 --> 02:06:20,172
Day after tomorrow morning.

2007
02:06:20,606 --> 02:06:21,573
Okay.

2008
02:06:24,610 --> 02:06:28,945
When I come there tomorrow morning, keep
the cheque for the balance amount ready.

2009
02:06:30,916 --> 02:06:32,975
I need to make a
lot of payments.

2010
02:06:57,409 --> 02:06:59,605
What is it?
What happened?

2011
02:07:00,145 --> 02:07:01,772
A mp?

2012
02:07:01,847 --> 02:07:03,815
Boss, Manoharan was on duty there.

2013
02:07:03,882 --> 02:07:06,146
He went out somewhere
for a couple of hours.

2014
02:07:06,285 --> 02:07:08,947
When he went back, our freezer
with the aunty was missing.

2015
02:07:12,891 --> 02:07:14,689
It was worth 15,000 Pounds.

2016
02:07:14,793 --> 02:07:16,818
Do you guys have any
responsibility, you donkeys?

2017
02:07:20,366 --> 02:07:22,835
Raju bro had a spare
key with him.

2018
02:07:23,002 --> 02:07:24,026
Then it must be him.

2019
02:07:24,103 --> 02:07:26,401
Are you able to reach his phone?
- No. It's switched off.

2020
02:07:26,639 --> 02:07:27,606
We should find him.

2021
02:07:27,673 --> 02:07:29,607
That item is supposed to be
buried tomorrow morning.

2022
02:07:29,675 --> 02:07:31,165
Wherever it is,
go find it, man!

2023
02:07:32,978 --> 02:07:35,072
This is such a cruel
play of fate, oh God!

2024
02:07:58,170 --> 02:08:00,036
What's happening?
- It's a dead body, Ma'am.

2025
02:08:00,372 --> 02:08:01,339
Dead body?

2026
02:08:01,740 --> 02:08:03,071
Whose?
- Rajagopal sir...

2027
02:08:03,142 --> 02:08:04,632
What?
- It's nof mine.

2028
02:08:05,344 --> 02:08:06,368
It's nof mine.

2029
02:08:10,282 --> 02:08:12,011
What is this, Raju?

2030
02:08:12,084 --> 02:08:13,051
I'll tell you.

2031
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:14,142
Tell me what this is!

2032
02:08:14,319 --> 02:08:15,650
I'll tell you!
- Raju!

2033
02:08:21,326 --> 02:08:22,293
Raj u!

2034
02:08:22,928 --> 02:08:23,895
Raju, stop there.

2035
02:08:23,962 --> 02:08:25,191
I'll explain everything in detail.

2036
02:08:25,264 --> 02:08:27,824
Before that, we need to keep
that freezer inside our house.

2037
02:08:27,900 --> 02:08:29,197
It's a dead body.
Whose is it?

2038
02:08:29,268 --> 02:08:30,235
I'll tell you.

2039
02:08:30,369 --> 02:08:32,133
Whatever the problems
between us might be,

2040
02:08:32,204 --> 02:08:33,694
I need a space inside
this house now.

2041
02:08:33,772 --> 02:08:36,298
To preserve the mother who's in that box.
- What nonsense are you saying, Raju?

2042
02:08:36,375 --> 02:08:37,342
Jomon!

2043
02:08:38,343 --> 02:08:39,310
It's his mother.

2044
02:08:39,445 --> 02:08:41,675
He is going to take her to
Kerala and give her a funeral.

2045
02:08:41,747 --> 02:08:42,771
I am helping him.

2046
02:08:42,848 --> 02:08:44,213
You need to understand
only that much now, Rekha.

2047
02:08:44,383 --> 02:08:46,977
Jomon, you can go.
Rest we'll do as we planned. Okay?

2048
02:08:47,086 --> 02:08:48,178
Reach there and call me.

2049
02:08:48,253 --> 02:08:49,277
Guna, keep the box inside.

2050
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:53,191
Rekha!

2051
02:09:19,952 --> 02:09:21,442
If that boy's brothers know this,

2052
02:09:21,854 --> 02:09:23,117
won't there be legal issues?

2053
02:09:23,922 --> 02:09:25,321
Will Dixon stay calm
if he knows this?

2054
02:09:26,892 --> 02:09:28,121
There would be many problems.

2055
02:09:28,227 --> 02:09:29,888
I'm not thinking
about all that now.

2056
02:09:30,062 --> 02:09:31,325
I took a decision.

2057
02:09:32,030 --> 02:09:34,465
I have a belief that it would happen.
Rig ht, aunty?

2058
02:09:35,134 --> 02:09:36,226
That's all I know.

2059
02:09:37,836 --> 02:09:39,270
You'll be with me, rig ht?
Or?

2060
02:09:39,338 --> 02:09:42,535
Will you fight with me for Pablo
Neruda's poem and Paulo Coelho's novel?

2061
02:09:44,243 --> 02:09:46,268
You should be killed.
Bloody rascal!

2062
02:09:46,345 --> 02:09:47,813
Aunty is watching!

2063
02:10:05,531 --> 02:10:06,498
Who is it?

2064
02:10:08,233 --> 02:10:10,167
It's Dixon.
- Dixon Lopez?

2065
02:10:10,536 --> 02:10:12,026
Rekha, you should deal this.

2066
02:10:12,271 --> 02:10:14,296
Anyway, I've been
wanting to deal with him.

2067
02:10:14,439 --> 02:10:17,807
He's a scoundrel who's spreading rumours
all over the world that we've divorced.

2068
02:10:17,876 --> 02:10:18,843
I'll show you now.

2069
02:10:29,288 --> 02:10:31,017
What is it, Dixon?
- Where is Raju?

2070
02:10:31,089 --> 02:10:33,057
Don't you know that Raju
doesn't stay here now?

2071
02:10:33,125 --> 02:10:34,490
I know that.
It's not that...

2072
02:10:34,860 --> 02:10:38,228
Did Raju bring some box"
I mean a big box...

2073
02:10:38,297 --> 02:10:39,787
There are no boxes here.

2074
02:10:39,898 --> 02:10:44,062
Well, a box is missing from the office.
I was wondering if it would be here...

2075
02:10:44,136 --> 02:10:45,797
You and your box!

2076
02:10:45,871 --> 02:10:47,430
If you come here ever
again asking all this,

2077
02:10:47,506 --> 02:10:49,201
I'll call the police.
- Oh no! Sister!

2078
02:10:49,274 --> 02:10:51,038
Sister, while I was just passing by...

2079
02:10:51,109 --> 02:10:52,804
Didn't I tell you that
it won't be here?

2080
02:10:53,445 --> 02:10:54,970
Good night.
- Get lost!

2081
02:10:59,051 --> 02:11:00,951
Boss, what do we do now?

2082
02:11:02,888 --> 02:11:05,619
Let the sun rise.
We will go and meet those idiots.

2083
02:11:06,191 --> 02:11:07,317
Follow me.
- Yes boss.

2084
02:11:10,596 --> 02:11:11,961
That funeral director...

2085
02:11:18,203 --> 02:11:19,170
Monichaya...

2086
02:11:19,338 --> 02:11:20,828
He has come with some bad news.

2087
02:11:21,173 --> 02:11:22,334
What happened?

2088
02:11:22,541 --> 02:11:23,906
It's not our mistake.

2089
02:11:24,142 --> 02:11:27,112
The problem is because you said you
can't keep the body in the mortuary.

2090
02:11:27,312 --> 02:11:29,041
We need a legal paper
from the authority.

2091
02:11:29,114 --> 02:11:31,845
Saying that the body was kept in the
mortuary since the time of death.

2092
02:11:31,917 --> 02:11:33,078
We need to give that
paper to the Church.

2093
02:11:33,385 --> 02:11:34,853
Well.. But now?

2094
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:37,321
We'll get the paper.
Talks are on, for that.

2095
02:11:38,090 --> 02:11:39,216
But time is the problem.

2096
02:11:39,691 --> 02:11:41,455
It won't happen today
morning anyway.

2097
02:11:42,928 --> 02:11:44,453
Then?
Our flight is at 12.30 PM.

2098
02:11:44,897 --> 02:11:47,332
Considering the present condition,

2099
02:11:47,399 --> 02:11:50,266
however much we try, the programme
will happen only by 4 - 4.30 PM.

2100
02:11:53,305 --> 02:11:54,272
Let's leave.

2101
02:11:54,473 --> 02:11:56,464
Let them conduct the funeral.
What else can we do?

2102
02:11:57,442 --> 02:11:59,103
We can't miss the flight.

2103
02:11:59,278 --> 02:12:00,245
Okay.

2104
02:12:01,113 --> 02:12:03,047
Doctor sir, what about
the rest of the payment?

2105
02:12:04,116 --> 02:12:05,345
Well, the rest of the payment...

2106
02:12:10,088 --> 02:12:12,022
mg
M!

2107
02:12:12,090 --> 02:12:13,114
ERA
ERA

2108
02:12:15,394 --> 02:12:16,418
Yes.

2109
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:18,897
Okay.

2110
02:12:38,350 --> 02:12:40,284
Raju, what you did was really shady.

2111
02:12:40,485 --> 02:12:43,386
I did what had to be done to a shady guy.
That's true!

2112
02:12:43,455 --> 02:12:46,083
Where is the body? We have to
bury it today evening. - Dixon!

2113
02:12:46,158 --> 02:12:48,559
Once a person is dead, people
would even forget the person's name.

2114
02:12:48,627 --> 02:12:50,391
After that it's just a corpse,
a dead body.

2115
02:12:50,529 --> 02:12:52,224
In your language - item, stuff!

2116
02:12:52,564 --> 02:12:53,622
Did you recognize him?

2117
02:12:55,367 --> 02:12:57,199
Its

2118
02:12:57,703 --> 02:12:59,137
Didn't you call it a body?

2119
02:12:59,304 --> 02:13:01,272
For him, it's his dead
mother who passed away.

2120
02:13:01,673 --> 02:13:04,574
She had a wish that her body
should be buried in her home town.

2121
02:13:04,643 --> 02:13:07,135
That wish is going to happen.
or, I'm going to make it happen.

2122
02:13:07,212 --> 02:13:08,543
You don't have a difference
of opinion in it, right?

2123
02:13:08,613 --> 02:13:10,707
My dear Raju, we've
taken the full payment.

2124
02:13:10,782 --> 02:13:13,683
Since you've taken the full payment,
you don't have anything to lose, right?

2125
02:13:13,752 --> 02:13:14,742
If you ask so...

2126
02:13:14,987 --> 02:13:17,718
That means, you don't have any objection
to take her body to Kerala, right?

2127
02:13:17,789 --> 02:13:19,348
But what do we tell the people who
paid the money? - Leave that.

2128
02:13:19,658 --> 02:13:21,956
They both will leave in the
morning flight itself.

2129
02:13:22,728 --> 02:13:25,425
In an available afternoon flight,
Jomon will leave with aunty.

2130
02:13:25,497 --> 02:13:27,727
Let him go.
- You should bear the expenses for it.

2131
02:13:27,799 --> 02:13:29,028
Me?
Why?

2132
02:13:29,101 --> 02:13:31,365
You should bear that expense from
the 15,000 Pounds you got for free.

2133
02:13:31,470 --> 02:13:32,960
That's such rubbish!

2134
02:13:33,271 --> 02:13:36,639
Dixon, no more dialogues.
I will talk. You should listen.

2135
02:13:36,708 --> 02:13:38,267
<i>Leave my hand, Raw.</i>

2136
02:13:39,745 --> 02:13:41,645
It's paining.
Leave my hand. I agree!

2137
02:13:41,713 --> 02:13:42,976
<i>L</i> agree!

2138
02:13:45,217 --> 02:13:46,412
Okay, Kunjumol.
Bye.

2139
02:13:46,551 --> 02:13:47,518
Bye.

2140
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:50,018
Leave happily.
I'm here for everything.

2141
02:13:50,188 --> 02:13:51,485
That's our only tension.

2142
02:13:51,556 --> 02:13:53,752
Poor guys are leaving, just
because I'm here to support.

2143
02:14:23,455 --> 02:14:25,514
Monichayan and Bennychan just left.

2144
02:14:25,590 --> 02:14:26,557
You just missed them.

2145
02:14:26,625 --> 02:14:28,252
I was waiting for them to leave.

2146
02:14:33,365 --> 02:14:34,696
No! Wait up for me!

2147
02:14:45,243 --> 02:14:46,210
Jomon...

2148
02:14:50,649 --> 02:14:52,139
What's the status of the funeral?

2149
02:14:52,217 --> 02:14:54,618
Everything is set. We will bury
her at 4 PM, at the Church here.

2150
02:14:54,686 --> 02:14:56,677
If it's about burying our mom,
that won't happen.

2151
02:14:56,788 --> 02:14:58,381
Huh?
- Jomon...

2152
02:14:58,623 --> 02:14:59,749
What are you saying?

2153
02:15:00,325 --> 02:15:02,316
Mom is not in Dixon Lopez's
rented house anymore.

2154
02:15:04,196 --> 02:15:06,358
Then?
- Mom is at a place I know.

2155
02:15:06,498 --> 02:15:08,296
I'll go home in an
afternoon flight with mom.

2156
02:15:08,433 --> 02:15:10,128
What are you saying, boy?

2157
02:15:20,712 --> 02:15:22,202
Rajuchetta"
Here.

2158
02:15:25,617 --> 02:15:26,584
Come here.

2159
02:15:27,152 --> 02:15:28,449
Jomon is not lying.

2160
02:15:29,488 --> 02:15:31,320
It's him.
That Nair.

2161
02:15:32,257 --> 02:15:34,225
You can see your mom
resting behind me, right?

2162
02:15:37,863 --> 02:15:39,194
According to your mom's wish...

2163
02:15:39,397 --> 02:15:40,592
According to Jomon's wish...

2164
02:15:41,333 --> 02:15:43,665
They are leaving today.
Mother and son.

2165
02:15:47,272 --> 02:15:48,330
Doctor Mukundanunni,

2166
02:15:48,607 --> 02:15:50,905
if you and your wife don't
have any objection,

2167
02:15:51,143 --> 02:15:52,668
you can join them on that journey.

2168
02:15:57,315 --> 02:15:59,306
At her birth-place,
in a land that she knows...

2169
02:15:59,818 --> 02:16:02,412
near the grave where her husband
became part of the soil,

2170
02:16:03,155 --> 02:16:06,386
a poor soul's wish or a
desire to rest there...

2171
02:16:06,925 --> 02:16:08,154
That is going to happen now.

2172
02:16:09,961 --> 02:16:10,928
Jomon...

2173
02:16:12,197 --> 02:16:13,824
You should talk to Anto and Ammini.

2174
02:16:15,567 --> 02:16:16,534
Okay?

2175
02:16:16,701 --> 02:16:17,668
Give it.

2176
02:16:18,170 --> 02:16:19,137
Okay Chetta.

2177
02:16:26,578 --> 02:16:29,206
This is the will that Antochayan
&Ammini Chechi are looking for.

2178
02:16:30,749 --> 02:16:33,343
A will in which mom wrote the
ancestral property in my name.

2179
02:16:34,286 --> 02:16:35,276
Read it and see.

2180
02:16:49,534 --> 02:16:50,763
Last time when I went home,

2181
02:16:51,269 --> 02:16:53,260
I accepted this only because
mom forced me a lot.

2182
02:16:53,572 --> 02:16:54,835
I never wished for this.

2183
02:16:55,240 --> 02:16:57,572
But I know that Ammini Chechi
has been longing for it.

2184
02:17:08,820 --> 02:17:10,948
I'm only happy to give it
to you, Ammini Chechi.

2185
02:17:13,391 --> 02:17:14,552
I have only one question now.

2186
02:17:17,562 --> 02:17:18,552
Are you coming with me?

2187
02:17:18,930 --> 02:17:21,763
To attend our mother's funeral
at our Church cemetery?

2188
02:17:27,472 --> 02:17:28,667
We're also coming, Jomon.

2189
02:17:36,514 --> 02:17:37,675
Me and Anto are also coming.

2190
02:17:37,749 --> 02:17:39,410
Then what!
The funeral will be in Kattappana!

2191
02:17:39,484 --> 02:17:40,952
Enough with all the
nonsense in London.

2192
02:17:59,537 --> 02:18:00,868
Finally, it has happened!

2193
02:18:08,980 --> 02:18:11,915
I can see a smile blooming inside.

2194
02:18:20,325 --> 02:18:21,292
Did you smile?

2195
02:18:26,464 --> 02:18:28,364
Or, is it just my
thought or imagination?

2196
02:18:31,069 --> 02:18:33,003
You're the one who made
me think all this, right?

2197
02:18:36,641 --> 02:18:38,666
I knowthatl can't
say 'See you later'.

2198
02:18:40,679 --> 02:18:42,545
We will be coming to Kattappana.

2199
02:18:42,947 --> 02:18:44,915
To see you sleeping next
to your Chachan (husband).

2200
02:21:34,719 --> 02:21:35,709
Gosh!

2201
02:21:36,054 --> 02:21:38,182
What happened?
Is it because aunty has left?

2202
02:21:38,923 --> 02:21:39,890
No.

2203
02:21:40,291 --> 02:21:44,489
Well, what did the spring
do with the cherry trees?

2204
02:21:45,063 --> 02:21:46,553
I hope it doesn't do anything.

2205
02:21:49,234 --> 02:21:50,998
Ku njachayan.
- I'll kill you if you pick up.

2206
02:21:51,069 --> 02:21:54,004
You and your Kunjachayan.
Calling only at the wrong times. Hang up!

2207
02:21:54,305 --> 02:21:55,636
What is this?
- Just a minute.

2208
02:21:56,574 --> 02:21:57,871
Hello Kunjachayan.
- Yes.

2209
02:21:57,976 --> 02:21:59,944
They have just left
to the airport now.

2210
02:22:00,545 --> 02:22:02,775
They will reach Nedumbasshery airport,
day after morning.

2211
02:22:02,847 --> 02:22:04,611
All arrangements have
been made there.

2212
02:22:04,782 --> 02:22:06,716
And I'm also going to Kattappana.

2213
02:22:06,885 --> 02:22:08,910
I'll go back to Kottayam,
only after the funeral.

2214
02:22:09,220 --> 02:22:10,244
And yeah...

2215
02:22:10,989 --> 02:22:12,718
Shall I ask you something?

2216
02:22:14,526 --> 02:22:17,518
How in the world did you
come up with that lie?

2217
02:22:18,730 --> 02:22:19,788
Which lie?

2218
02:22:21,132 --> 02:22:22,861
Since I lie quite a lot...

2219
02:22:22,934 --> 02:22:25,232
That there's a problem in the
piling of that building?

2220
02:22:27,338 --> 02:22:30,273
What happened?
- My dear, it actually has a problem.

2221
02:22:30,742 --> 02:22:32,176
Engineer Balachandran told me.

2222
02:22:32,810 --> 02:22:36,007
Problematic things shouldn't be
built upon this earth, Kunjachayan.

2223
02:22:36,581 --> 02:22:38,777
What has to be demolished,
should be demolished.

2224
02:22:38,950 --> 02:22:41,317
And, the fate of the money that
her children have pumped in,

2225
02:22:41,553 --> 02:22:44,181
would depend upon the report
that aunty gives up there.

2226
02:22:44,255 --> 02:22:45,279
Who has pumped in?

2227
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:48,618
Whoever has pumped it in,
money is money right, Kunjachayan?

2228
02:22:50,161 --> 02:22:52,721
'Come and witness'

2229
02:22:53,898 --> 02:22:56,868
'A festival you've never seen before'

2230
02:22:58,269 --> 02:23:01,102
'Come and witness'

2231
02:23:02,073 --> 02:23:05,202
'Our festival'

2232
02:23:06,811 --> 02:23:10,714
'Hasn't someone wise said long back,
and haven't you heard in folklore?'

2233
02:23:10,782 --> 02:23:15,185
'That all the world's a
stage, oh my dear birdie'

2234
02:23:42,614 --> 02:23:46,812
'Someone binds our eyes and ears'

2235
02:23:46,884 --> 02:23:50,821
'And we play unknown pans'

2236
02:23:50,888 --> 02:23:54,791
'Once we enter the
stage created by time'

2237
02:23:54,859 --> 02:23:58,796
'There's no way to escape.
We just have to keep running'

2238
02:23:58,863 --> 02:24:02,766
'Once we're trapped in
pits we dug ourselves,
