1
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,050
My name is Surya.

2
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,180
The sunshine in my name is missing
from my life since a year now.

3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,140
If there's any reason I feel remotely alive today
after this one year of dark phase,

4
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,430
It's only Vaishali.

5
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:26,260
There's a deep affinity that Kolkata and this place in
Nepal shares, both in terms of my love life and my future.

6
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,680
We met here for the last time, exactly a year ago.

7
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:44,300
This personal battle spanning 365 days i.e. 8760 hours
and over one lakh minutes is finally coming to an end.

8
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,180
We lose kingdoms in battles,

9
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,430
but I'll lose the purpose in my life without Vaishali's return.

10
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,390
This very thought can take my breath away.

11
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:02,890
Hey...

12
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,430
Hey..that's my bag.

13
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,300
Hey...

14
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,260
Come on, get down.

15
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,800
Sir, please listen to me..please

16
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,350
How do you think you can escape after smacking a cop?

17
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,100
Take him into custody

18
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,100
Sir, please..this is very important to me..

19
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,680
I've come all the way from India to Nepal just for this..

20
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,760
Oh, you're from India?
Where do you stay there?

21
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:54,850
Yes, I am from Kolkata.

22
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,260
Oh, a Bengali I suppose!

23
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,510
No sir, we're Telugu speaking

24
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,350
Oh..Telugu..

25
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,550
Even my wife is Telugu speaking..

26
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:02,890
It was a love marriage..

27
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,220
a painful one..

28
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,300
Sir, I've been waiting for tomorrow since a year now..
Let me go.

29
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,970
Regardless of the country where you beat up a cop,
be it India or Nepal, it's still a big crime.

30
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,050
You'll be put behind bars for at least three years now..

31
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,600
Hey Alok...
-Yes sir

32
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,970
File a chargesheet.
-Okay sir.

33
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,680
Sir, Why bother to file a chargesheet for this petty issue?

34
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,600
Give me only one chance to meet Vaishali,

35
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,050
you're free to do anything to me,
I don't even mind being hanged.

36
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,640
Is this a love story?
-Yes sir

37
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:31,140
I like love stories, please go on.

38
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,970
I'll tell my story once I return..let me go.

39
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:33,680
Hey...

40
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,800
Either tell me your love story or stay behind
bars for three years, the choice is yours

41
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,600
Hey silence, can't you see I'm listening to a song.

42
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,550
Hey, take this.

43
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:33,140
Where can I find Surya?

44
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,850
He'll rise within five minutes.

45
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,140
Even the kid isn't scared of me, go hunt for him..

46
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,550
Surya deserves a smacking at any cost today.

47
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,010
By the way, where's Darshi?

48
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,680
He's yet to recover from the shock that
Revathi gave him yesterday.

49
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,640
Who's she?

50
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,220
His sister, since yesterday.
Come, take a seat.

51
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:54,970
Didn't get it.

52
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,140
He's asking you about Revathi, who's she?

53
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,930
Listening to a Kishore Kumar song as I was getting
drenched in the rains, I asked her out for a coffee..

54
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,930
What happened then?

55
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,550
And then she addressed him as her brother.

56
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,760
Hey...Surya.

57
00:06:10,890 --> 00:06:11,930
Surya..

58
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:12,970
Yes.

59
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,180
Hey, give me the keys

60
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,800
Why're you staring at me?
Look, Surya's there, try beating him up.

61
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,050
Go, beat him up

62
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:43,970
Why're you looking at him?

63
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,470
Go, beat him up

64
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,600
Do we have any score to settle with this group?
-These look like a new set of faces. Look at them!

65
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,050
Hello..

66
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:03,760
Who the hell are you?
-Milkha Singh..

67
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,510
What are you standing for..go, run!
- At least inform me before you leave.

68
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,930
Hey..come fast..

69
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,220
Looks like Surya is lucky today..
-Hey, Milkha Singh?

70
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,800
Who the hell are you Milkha Singh?

71
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,600
Mithun Chakraborty..

72
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,010
No..Pranab Mukherjee.

73
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,640
Mukherjee's... Phone.

74
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,890
Hello...

75
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,350
Boss, we caught Surya.

76
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,260
What should we do.

77
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,800
This isn't Surya..

78
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,220
This isn't the Surya that we want.

79
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,050
What?

80
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,800
It's a misunderstanding..

81
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,100
a confusion..

82
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,850
Do you kill people even as you're confused?

83
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:16,890
A small confusion..

84
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,680
Because of a small confusion you're gonna beat me up.

85
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,470
What's this spate of violence for,

86
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,510
you haven't even thought about it,

87
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,760
Violence is Impurity.

88
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,050
put an end to all forms of violence.

89
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:52,050
Have I walked on the same land as yours all these days?

90
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,720
I feel like freezing the world this moment.

91
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,850
My past didn't let me unite with you

92
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,430
I feel like waging a battle against time.

93
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,970
I've taken a leap of faith today
Is this freedom?

94
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:20,550
You've broken my shackles unknowingly.

95
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,760
It's the first revolt for my heart of
preserving me from you.

96
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,300
I am freed from a prison-like loneliness.

97
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,430
To your heart that never acknowledged my presence.

98
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:42,510
Here I come to win it over

99
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:52,220
Put an end to my loneliness
With a mere glance

100
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:03,640
I'll even dedicate my next birth to you
Come, conquer my kingdom.

101
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,800
Even though I'm a part of your silence.

102
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:15,640
I'm transforming into the God (Shiva) that
shields you from the venom.

103
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,850
(Indistinct Voices..)

104
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,220
Hey, where are you going?

105
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,260
(Indistinct Voices..)

106
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,510
Hey, go back.

107
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,010
Due to sake of you people traffic is getting stuck.

108
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,260
Silence.

109
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,550
What happened...?

110
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,100
Due to sake of them... we are getting late for our Programme.

111
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,100
What's up with you dude?

112
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:29,220
Grandma..grandma..

113
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,550
What is it, my dear?

114
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,140
Where's sister Vaishali?

115
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,010
She'll be here soon

116
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,470
Hey..you've come at last.

117
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:38,390
Dad..
-Yes

118
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,100
Is there something that you want to tell me about?

119
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,010
I don't think so..

120
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,260
By the way, your sister had just called..

121
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,430
They're planning to shift your niece to the US apparently..

122
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,720
What much can we say?

123
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,600
You know I'm not talking about that

124
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,510
What is it then?

125
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,010
Weren't you drunk the previous night?

126
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,180
It was only a single peg..

127
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,220
I swear.

128
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:04,720
Trust me, only a single peg

129
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:09,800
Okay, just a couple of pegs,

130
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,800
why don't you call Gokhle uncle to confirm?

131
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,890
Dad, you're a magistrate..

132
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,510
Falsehood doesn't augur well for you..

133
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,850
This is the last time.

134
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,930
Vaishali
-Yes, mom

135
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,760
Hey..don't tell her about it!

136
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,010
She'll create unnecessary drama now.

137
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,850
Vaishali

138
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:25,930
Let's see.

139
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,300
Hey, you've climbed a pole?

140
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,550
What's gotten into you?

141
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,470
The girl has made me crazy..

142
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,550
The craziness does have a name called Vaishali..

143
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:50,050
She won't fall for you

144
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,300
I don't mind dying at her feet then

145
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:59,600
Is it? She'll even suggest you a way to die,
she'll definitely like people who'll die for her

146
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,350
What if I tell that I'll kill her.

147
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,470
Hey..are you in love or are you setting up a land deal?

148
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,510
We haven't even told you much about her..

149
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,550
She's like the English teacher for a Telugu medium student.

150
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,390
She won't bother to hear us..
while we can't comprehend her words either.

151
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,550
Then how do I make her fall for me?

152
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,140
Oh..what a question?

153
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:26,970
This is the answer that the humankind has
been hunting for since centuries without much success.

154
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,180
continue to try.

155
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,050
What if she could rescue me?

156
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,260
I don't get it..

157
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,850
We will catch a cold if we get drenched.

158
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,010
You'll also be panting for breath as you run..

159
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,970
Guys, go smack that idiot!

160
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,010
( Indistinct voices...)

161
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,100
Please save me, someone,
I need help, Please save me!

162
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,760
Please save me...

163
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,680
(Indistinct Voices...)

164
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,390
Please save me!

165
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,600
Please save me!

166
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
Catch this Goons.

167
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,470
Don't spare him.,beat him to a pulp..

168
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,760
what are you running for, stop, you idiot!

169
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,350
How many streets you will roam like this.

170
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,390
Please help me someone..

171
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,350
Is there anyone around to rescue me?

172
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,890
Wasn't he here sometime ago?

173
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,050
Go find him, he wouldn't have run far..there he is

174
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,010
Find him.

175
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,300
Please don't shout.

176
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,010
They're a group of ten..
And I'm alone and I won't be spared.

177
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,640
Could you help me for once please?

178
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,680
I'll take this off when you stop shouting.

179
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,850
Oh..you?

180
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,800
What..?

181
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:54,100
You'd just promised me you wouldn't shout.

182
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,970
They're a big bunch and they'll beat me to death.

183
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,550
Please save me.

184
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,550
Did you spot anyone on the run here?

185
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,430
That way.

186
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,720
He's gone that way,

187
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,260
don't spare him guys!

188
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,470
What's happening...? didn't you find
any other place to make romance.

189
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,890
Think he got caught up..let's move

190
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:30,510
You'd promised you would not shout.

191
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,510
These are the goons....
Smack them hard!

192
00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:46,800
Very thanks for saving me

193
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,720
It's okay,

194
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,220
why did you act as if you were so familiar to me before?

195
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,550
I don't remember seeing you anytime.

196
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,220
You may not know me,
but I've known you since two years now

197
00:16:59,010 --> 00:16:59,720
How's that?

198
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,550
I've been in love with you since two years

199
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,180
What?

200
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,680
I mean I've been following you since two years.

201
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,550
you won't even get it..don't try asking me a reason.

202
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,220
I get it, but I just don't care.

203
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,850
Exactly..You haven't even noticed that I've been following you.

204
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,550
I don't understand why's he chasing me either.

205
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:22,390
He was about to kill me.

206
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,260
luckily, If not for you... I wouldn't have been alive

207
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,140
What are you talking about?

208
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:31,220
Why should someone else feel bad that you're behind me?

209
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,350
Who's he?

210
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,600
How would I know?

211
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,600
There are over hundreds like me who're going crazy about you.

212
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,100
How do I pinpoint one person?

213
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,430
What's wrong in admiring you from a certain distance?

214
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:47,470
As long as you don't irritate me, I don't even care.

215
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,930
I've been loving you since two years now Vaishu.

216
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:55,390
Have I done anything..well..to irritate you?

217
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,260
Don't dare call me Vaishu,

218
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,050
It's only the near and dear who call me that way!

219
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,600
My name is Surya.

220
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,640
you don't have any choice but to call me that way!

221
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,890
The senior citizens nearly ripped me apart.

222
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:19,220
If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have been alive.

223
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,180
Damn..I've missed.

224
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:23,800
Coin, dude.

225
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,140
You can't even hit the right target within this close distance
and daydream of making Vaishali fall for you.

226
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,220
and the girl doesn't even care two hoots
for you even as you stand beside her..

227
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:35,930
She doesn't even respond to people

228
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,800
Not even if they plead to her.

229
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,350
Anyone would talk about the person who stands beside them.

230
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:42,720
it's about making an impact even in one's absence.

231
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,800
If I'm not wrong, the girl should already
be discussing about me by now.

232
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,600
It was your fault, it was your fault,

233
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,050
but it was your fault that road was bad, and it was such
huge hill and this happened, that happened.

234
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,600
They're talking about everything except your matter.

235
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:03,850
are they even doctors? I only hear adult jokes.

236
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,390
The dirty talk that we have during our
drinks is of no match to this.

237
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,390
I'm being honest..

238
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:15,430
Like that quote where we talk about how the stains
wouldn't perish despite repeated attempts.

239
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:17,050
she isn't a girl who'll fall for you.

240
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,470
I'd advise you to give up on her

241
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,300
No.

242
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,220
Destiny may not favour us every time..

243
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:24,140
It happens...

244
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:26,260
but we need to make sure, it does so soon

245
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,640
Hello Shailu... coming.

246
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:52,550
A mild breeze invites a large wave

247
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,220
That completely conceals me as it arrives.

248
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,600
A heavenly beauty from a dream boards a train.

249
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,140
To wander on the earth.

250
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,100
The air starts talking
The earth waters my feet

251
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,600
The rain holds an umbrella, as you arrive

252
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,390
I'm not in a hurry to meet you

253
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:32,050
I don’t intend to leave until I make my dream a reality..
The time too fades away in your presence.

254
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:37,640
The world has transformed all of a sudden
The sky and the earth have united in my heart

255
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,760
I hear a name alike the chanting of the Omkara.

256
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:48,600
The world has transformed all of a sudden
The sky and the earth have united in my heart

257
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,720
I hear a name alike the chanting of the Omkara.

258
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:59,180
I've written secretive letters
Those are full of gestures and not alphabets.

259
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,600
I've foreseen a future.

260
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,180
Hey Vaishu..

261
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,970
Hi, how are you?
-I'm fine.

262
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,890
It's so nice to see you.
-It's been a longtime indeed

263
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,550
You've become so chubby

264
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,970
What chubby, I've put on weight I know!

265
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,470
You can't escape, come home now

266
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:21,430
He didn't stop.

267
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,510
He will stop.

268
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:27,140
What the hell is this man?
What are you thinking about yourself?

269
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:30,760
You won't even offer a lift to a boy if he asks so,

270
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:32,800
but for a girl, you do so even without asking?

271
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,140
What are you talking about?

272
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,470
He's disappointed because you offered
to drop Vaishali to her home yesterday.

273
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,890
Vaishali has been my neighbour for years,
we're classmates in school and college

274
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,350
He doesn't intend to spare you
if he spots you with her next time.

275
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:48,800
I get it.

276
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:55,180
Alike smoking and drinking, I've now realised offering
a ride to my neighbour is also injurious to health.

277
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,300
Bat well, don't get runout

278
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,140
Sure sir..

279
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,720
My eyes haven't spotted anything like this in the past

280
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:18,350
So much that my eyebrows refuse to be shut.

281
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:34,760
It seems like my heart would stop beating
Drowning in this wave of beauty

282
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,890
The storm hasn't moved past the edge of the umbrella
You're the lava flowing in the heart

283
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:46,720
A river, that's nowhere to be seen, is overflowing
And it has merged with the seas as it met you.

284
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:52,140
The world has transformed all of a sudden
The sky and the earth have united in my heart

285
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:57,300
I hear a name alike the chanting of the Omkara...

286
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:03,140
The world has transformed all of a sudden
The sky and the earth have united in my heart

287
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:08,350
I hear a name alike the chanting of the Omkara...

288
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,930
Hey..listen..Get up..

289
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,600
are you following me?

290
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,680
Didn't I tell you about it yesterday?

291
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,930
It's not fair on your part to talk to me in such close proximity..

292
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,550
What if he sees me?

293
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,680
Who will see you?

294
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,300
Who knows? May be your lover in exile.

295
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,550
He created a ruckus even as I merely looked at you.

296
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
What if he sees us conversing like this?

297
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:40,550
When I prefer loving you from a certain distance,
why do you intimidate me like this?

298
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,800
Why don't you simply get it?

299
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,760
Mr Surya...

300
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,300
Mr Surya...

301
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,260
Mr Surya...

302
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:00,680
Yes.

303
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,970
You aren't even leaving me here?

304
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,890
What if he notices me in your company and kills me?

305
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,100
I should consider myself lucky that he isn't here.

306
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,010
Could you please talk in a language that
I could understand.

307
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,390
He has spotted us conversing.

308
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,050
And then?

309
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:26,510
He threatened to kill me if I loved..I mean..followed you..

310
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,510
Even a doctor wouldn't have known
if an X-Ray could come to use in so many ways..

311
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,510
You're awesome!

312
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:40,390
Being such a scarecrow, you should've told him
you aren't in love with me..

313
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,010
I've made that mistake too.

314
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:48,890
I've lied to him.. That I'm not in love with you

315
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:50,850
But he didn't believe me.
- Why...?

316
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,600
I'd asked him the same thing.

317
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,100
He'd told me that my words belied the truth in my eyes.

318
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,220
Biscuit...
-Idiot.

319
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,800
Do you really see my love for you through these eyes?

320
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,050
Yes..Yes..I see something.

321
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:15,470
If he loves me so much, why's he chasing you and not me?

322
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,180
He's scared.

323
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,890
He's worried if you would reject him.

324
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,600
He's worried if you would fall for me sometime.

325
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:31,760
He's worried.

326
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,010
How could you come up with such stuff in no time?

327
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,760
All to satiate my hunger..what else can I do?

328
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,290
Morning sir..
-Please sit.

329
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,660
Hey Gokhle..

330
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,250
Hey, why did you ask me to come down suddenly?

331
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,330
Sir.. I am also one among the crores residing in Kolkata..

332
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,700
Thanks for letting me be anonymous.

333
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,950
Gokhle, the point I'm making is that
a hardcore criminal like Dhanraj Pillai...

334
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:10,500
who's reportedly committed over
40 murders is now seeking an MLA ticket and worse,

335
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,950
there are several regional parties keen
to give him that opportunity?

336
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,870
Are you listening...?
Yes.

337
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,540
What's the point of being alive when I can't even question this?.

338
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,830
I really hope you realise this an insult to this democracy
and take some serious action and not let this happen.

339
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,000
yours truly, an anonymous citizen.

340
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:31,120
Hey..what are you doing to your hair?

341
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:33,790
I'm washing my hair with a shampoo after applying oil.

342
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,450
Boss is becoming a small kid day by day.

343
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,540
Where did you go till now...?

344
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,950
What's the matter?

345
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:43,790
What happened?

346
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:47,950
The cops are coming..

347
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,250
Who's so gutsy to come here?

348
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:55,370
The magistrate Prakash is now in their control.

349
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,750
Bribe him with any amount that he quotes..

350
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:05,620
It's tough, I meant, he doesn't stand by anything but justice..

351
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,790
Hello brother..

352
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,620
This Friday, the tenth day in the Telugu calendar.

353
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,870
Yes..apparently, it's an auspicious day..

354
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,290
and also, the inauspicious hour is about to end in ten minutes.
and I'm planning to kill you all.

355
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,200
If you have any hopes of staying alive,we have option for that too..

356
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:50,040
If my boss comes out with in ten minutes
you can reach your home safely.

357
00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:02,830
Are you thinking that anyone might come to save you.
No way.. no one is around.

358
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,750
Magistrate..Prakash.

359
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,410
Yes, I saw you on the TV yesterday sir..

360
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:16,200
Wasn't it you who put Dhanraj behind bars?..
That was good riddance sir.

361
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,410
You truly deserve all the praise..Let's talk over a cup of coffee.

362
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,080
I don't like if someone places their hand on my shoulder.

363
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,000
I fear my hand wouldn't be in my control then.
Sir, please join me..

364
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,580
Who's he? he broke his hand something like it's a sugarcane.

365
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,410
I think he is his fan.

366
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,540
I'll kill him right after this cup of tea.

367
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,160
You were calling it an inauspicious hour then,
and now you talk of killing him after a cup of tea.

368
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,200
Do you have any intention to kill him at all?

369
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:49,330
Somanna would put his head down in shame
if we threaten that boy now..

370
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:59,120
Do we have any scores to settle?

371
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,370
How is it even possible? We'd just met..

372
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,370
Look at how he's staring at me with a rage in his eyes.

373
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:10,250
Why? Don't you like it?

374
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,660
No..someone please tell him to not look at me that way.

375
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,370
Oh no...

376
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,000
Look at the way he's beating them up.

377
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,540
this is a behaviour of someone who deserves to be jailed..

378
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,660
Think you got it totally wrong here.

379
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:10,040
keep going, I'll come soon
-Where?

380
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,750
Wasn't it you who talked about criminals being jailed?
I am on it..please proceed..

381
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,910
Hello...
-You b....

382
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,790
Oh man, relax.

383
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,830
I don't know you, where you'd come from.

384
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,250
but you have been a God-sent saviour for me today,
your father must really be proud of you..

385
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:52,910
Padma,

386
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,330
what's your problem in signing the divorce papers?

387
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:00,700
Padma...

388
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,540
Surya.. go and play outside.

389
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,750
Why are asking me for a divorce Vivek?

390
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:17,410
I just don't like this.. You, Surya and this
family are roadblocks to my ambitions..

391
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,700
I am not able to handle this.

392
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,790
What have we done to earn your wrath?

393
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:28,450
Forget me, what wrong has the little one (Surya) done to you?

394
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,950
Wasn't it you who insisted on this marriage?

395
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,750
I'd always asked you to think twice before marrying me,

396
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,120
didn't I tell you that marriage isn't
merely about staying together...

397
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:42,540
and that it needs two individuals
who can't live without one another?

398
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:43,950
What did you say then Vivek?

399
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,660
Vivek.. I am asking you.
-Don't shout.

400
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:52,120
I'd liked you then and I felt it was right then..
I don't like it now, what's your problem?

401
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,080
Just sign those divorce papers.
- I won't.

402
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,790
Surya needs a father at this age.
- I don't feel it's necessary,

403
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:03,910
I merely introduced him to this world as my son.

404
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:07,040
Why should I protect him? What kind of shit is this Padma?

405
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,120
What should I understand? And why should I?

406
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,160
I am least concerned, I just don't care.

407
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,750
Mom...

408
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,040
Mom...

409
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,700
Mom...

410
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,580
Surya.
-Mom...

411
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,000
Mom, I don't need a dad.

412
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,660
I don't need him mom.

413
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,620
Even I don't need him.

414
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,660
my son..that's why I'd sent him off.

415
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,330
I'm there for you..

416
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,370
Why are getting wet outside? Come in.

417
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:55,330
Mom, did you ever miss dad?

418
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,700
What's your point in discussing it now? Get in..

419
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,450
Why don't you tell me?

420
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,200
Once in a while, yes

421
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,160
Maybe you should've left me,
you would've been happy at least.

422
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:09,290
Cut that crap..

423
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,370
Honestly..I wan't you to turn a child again.

424
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,500
I wish I could carry you in my arms
and relive those times all over again.

425
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,830
(Song Humming in background..)

426
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,290
I'll repeat my number, please note it down.

427
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,830
It's an art to make a girl fall for me
without her knowledge.

428
00:33:35,910 --> 00:33:39,790
Correct, Anything that you do subconsciously
is a piece of fine art that comes to you by birth.

429
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,830
You are?

430
00:33:41,870 --> 00:33:43,790
I am Gemini Natarajan sir..I'm an Oracle developer..

431
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,080
I think we've met before.
-This face? No chance at all

432
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,080
I don't like if someone places their hands on my shoulder.
- Same here.!

433
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:53,330
Oh, were you talking about yourself!
Please take a seat..

434
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:55,370
Hello...

435
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,200
You'd told me your number, but your name is..?

436
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,700
Vaishali Cherukuri..How many times do you
ask me the same question?

437
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,160
Hello...

438
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:13,200
You've told me your name,

439
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,620
why don't you tell me a place and a time to meet as well?

440
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:21,830
We've interesting unlimited night packages for young
and beautiful doctors like you.

441
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:24,410
You can call us so many times.

442
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,080
Hi...

443
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:30,410
Provided you say yes.. or you can say no as well,

444
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,040
but if you try to act smart in front of many people,

445
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:38,790
I'll catch hold of you at place where there's no network at all..

446
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,450
Hey, Gemini.. I remembered where I saw you?
- No chance.. where?

447
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,000
At the police station..I'm sure..

448
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,120
Impossible, I didn't even go to the cops when I lost my laptop.

449
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,660
Oh, why are you here...?

450
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,660
I'm lucky to be alive because this was
a running train, imagine my plight otherwise?

451
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:54,660
What do you say Gemini?
-No chance.

452
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,950
Hello..Shailu, a group of goons are creating a ruckus here.

453
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,080
Are they even aware of what they're talking.
We should just kill them right there.

454
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,500
these idiots should be hanged till death..

455
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,080
You think you can whack those goons
and make the girl fall for your heroics?

456
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,330
No chance at all.

457
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:18,370
I will see you soon..ha ha ha Next stop..

458
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,540
Looks like he'll get down from a running train.
-Hey..stay there, I'm coming

459
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,830
She has left, you've no chance to show your heroics.

460
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,830
That's perfect..

461
00:35:30,870 --> 00:35:31,870
That's what I meant too.

462
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,000
Why are you staring at me that way?
Call me if you want any night packages..

463
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,910
No chance at all!

464
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,410
Hey..why did you whack me so hard..are you crazy?

465
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,750
what's this? Why are you beating me up?

466
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:02,540
Gods reside at that place where the
women are respected..(in Sanskrit)

467
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,700
Why are you speaking in Kannada language
when I asked you something?

468
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,910
I'll beat you up till you make sense of those words.

469
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,120
Hey...sense it
-Hey.. who's he?

470
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,700
Get up...

471
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,620
Did you get to know at least ?
-No, brother!

472
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:29,700
Find it out..

473
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,370
Oh my...Someone please rescue me...

474
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,290
Do you want to know you about fashion?

475
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,160
Here you go..What do you think of yourself?

476
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,620
I think I finally remember..
I remembered our first encounter as you hit him,

477
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,080
we had met at a police station previously..

478
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,910
How dare you tease women?

479
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,580
Your wallet..

480
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,450
Weren't you telling something.
-It's your wallet sir.

481
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:50,120
Did I drop it somewhere?
-No sir..

482
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52,700
I stole the wallet at the time when we were discussing about the
art of making the girl fall for you subconsciously.

483
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,700
How could you notice it?

484
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,200
Have you finally learnt your lesson?
Would you dare tease women ever again?

485
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,790
Oh my..Oh my..

486
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,450
I beg you..please tell me sense of that.
-I don't know... you go from here.

487
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,700
Did you get it?

488
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:05,750
Got it sir..I won't ever do it in my life..

489
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,620
Why don't you tell me what's this all about?
He's ripping me apart here.

490
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,080
Oh, was this for you?
I thought it was directed at me.

491
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:12,620
Please sir... no...
- I have a small doubt..

492
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,580
What's that?

493
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,950
Any guy would try to show his heroics in front of a girl..

494
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,910
Which girl?
-Get lost.

495
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:18,000
sir, why did you start this only after she'd left?

496
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,950
I was with the girl then.
-Yes

497
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:21,910
Didn't someone else beat up these guys?

498
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,040
I thought you'd done it.

499
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,040
Yes, I was the one to beat them up.
but that guy was different who was with her.

500
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,410
If the other guy was with the girl...

501
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:30,870
why did I steal his wallet?

502
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,950
Step aside.
-It's better if you realise it now.

503
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:35,410
I won't..you're free to do whatever you want,
you wastrel!

504
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,700
Aren't both guys the same?

505
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,750
Only you and I know this..

506
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,790
Then what about Madam.

507
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,910
So there's no chance that she would realise this.

508
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,790
Why isn't this shutting.

509
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,790
my bloody fate..Why did I even go overboard with my talk?.

510
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,370
Oh God.

511
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,450
Looks like he'll kill me here..
Anyone who gets this, please bother to explain.

512
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:17,370
The Gods reside at a place
where women are respected (in Telugu)

513
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,620
Did you get it?
-Oh yes..sir

514
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,500
Sister.

515
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:31,330
Sister.

516
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,700
What are these blows?

517
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:40,250
He'd hit me so hard that I even remembered
my previous birth.

518
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,330
I'd then realised that you were my sister in my previous birth.

519
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:49,580
and I had got you married without your approval,
for which I am leading the life of a fool this birth,

520
00:38:50,950 --> 00:38:52,580
Please help me.

521
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,620
please free me off my sins by tying this raakhi.

522
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:00,830
He'd hit you all just because you had teased me.

523
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,290
Who's he?

524
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,040
Don't you know him either?

525
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,000
Actually, no..

526
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,660
I've only heard about him but didn't get to see him.

527
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,330
Lordess Rukmini..She hadn't even met Lord Krishna.

528
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,040
It's all thanks to Narada's enriching
descriptions of his personality

529
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:42,540
and his uniqueness that made Rukmini
an ardent admirer of Krishna.

530
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,290
Oh my Lord (Krishna)
What are you upto?

531
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:55,540
Why can't I see you?

532
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,830
I've always listened to you
I'm patiently waiting for you

533
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,200
Why don't you put an end to this illusion?

534
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:12,620
Destroying the demons
Winning me over...

535
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:17,370
You've played a lot of games

536
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:22,830
Why can't you come down to meet me?

537
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,370
Oh my lovely girl, why do you want me to come?

538
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:34,580
Oh my lovely girl, what do you wish to say?

539
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh my lovely girl, I understand your pain

540
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,330
Oh my lovely girl, I'm here to conquer...

541
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:52,910
Oh my lovely girl, I was just
playfully teasing you..Oh my love..

542
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:54,660
Oh Lord, the jewel of the Yadava kingdom
The destroyer of the demoness Puthana.

543
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,370
In the deep waters of river Yamuna

544
00:41:57,410 --> 00:42:00,000
You've destroyed the venomous serpent Kaliya

545
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:05,160
You've helped many kings attain salvation.

546
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:10,580
Why don't you grace us with your beautiful avatar?

547
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,290
I've thought about you,

548
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:18,620
Dreamt about you, Oh Lord, please grace us!
Hey, the lord of several Gopikas,

549
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,790
Hey Krishna, the giver of freedom.

550
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:29,250
Oh my lovely girl, why do you want me to come?

551
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:37,000
Oh my lovely girl, I was just
playfully teasing you..Oh my love..

552
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,700
Oh my lovely girl, Oh my lovely girl.

553
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,620
Where's your helmet?
-It was too heavy on the head..

554
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:56,580
Show me your license then?

555
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,500
I've left it at home..

556
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,370
File a chalan of Rs.500, he isn't wearing a helmet.

557
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,330
Let me go..
-take that bike keys.

558
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,450
Let me go..I don't have any cash
with me..I really don't!

559
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,290
Surya...

560
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:05,620
Hi...

561
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,120
I need to talk to you,

562
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:10,080
can we talk over a cup of coffee?

563
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:27,830
The invisible man who'd chased you..
do you at least know his name?

564
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,700
The man who beats me up wouldn't tell me his name right?

565
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,250
I don't know

566
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:36,000
The same guy who ripped apart
those idiotic goons on the train.

567
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,000
Is it?
-Yes..

568
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,450
That's my fear too...

569
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:51,000
What if he sees us conversing like this?
I am already scared for my life!

570
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,910
But it's exciting, isn't it.

571
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,540
You know what I'm beginning to like his madness.

572
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,700
Even Rukmini had only heard about
Lord Krishna and fell for him.

573
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,370
From the time you and the other guys spoke to me about him.

574
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:10,580
I am not able to get him out of my head, he is in my dreams,
he is everywhere and I am like.

575
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,580
I am not able to bear this.

576
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:18,500
No idiot in this world should ideally face such a situation.

577
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:25,660
Masking his true identity and acting
like another person isn't any cakewalk.

578
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,330
I can't..you know.

579
00:44:31,790 --> 00:44:32,910
Hi Mannav...
-Hi.

580
00:44:33,790 --> 00:44:35,750
How does he look?..How tall is he?

581
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:39,660
Guess he's as tall as me.

582
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,950
Is his skin tone similar to yours too?

583
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
Yes..but how did you know?

584
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:44,910
Mannav...

585
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,790
There's a guy wearing a green shirt behind you.

586
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,370
He's getting extremely irritated
as we're striking a conversation.

587
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:54,910
Don't get scared.

588
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:00,250
I'm here for you..My gut says that he's the guy.

589
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:03,500
Could you confirm me if he's the same man.

590
00:45:04,450 --> 00:45:05,250
Please.

591
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,330
isn't he?

592
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,700
Right..!

593
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,790
Right..!

594
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,910
He's not.

595
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:24,330
I guess you're upset..I didn't mean that.

596
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,660
Who am I to get upset?

597
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:28,950
After all whom am I?

598
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,620
Yes, all whom am I?

599
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,370
You're anyways a Rukmini

600
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:36,200
And he's Lord Krishna?

601
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:39,620
Then who am I?

602
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,330
Maybe Krishna's cousin Sishupala?

603
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,750
At least for the time being..

604
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,660
Then..I guess my end is in the hands of Lord Krishna?

605
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,910
I understand your fears..

606
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:53,660
Damn...

607
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,910
You're scared if he would kill you for following me..right?

608
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:59,250
I think I have a solution..

609
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:00,410
What's that..?

610
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,250
I'll tie you a rakhi and call you my brother...
he wouldn't bother you anytime again.

611
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:04,950
What say...?

612
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,540
Hey...What are you talking?

613
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:14,000
Don't take foolish decisions, it's my job to unite you both.

614
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,790
I'll call you when he's about to beat me up..
you can leave.

615
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,040
Promise?..Thank you.

616
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,870
It should happen to you.

617
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,700
You're a fraudster.

618
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,410
you've no option but to fall at Vaishali's feet
and tell the truth..

619
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,200
there's no other way around.

620
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,750
there's no other way around.

621
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,750
I nearly went to Vaishali's college to reveal the truth.

622
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,040
but, this guy Shravan turned my plans tipsy-topsy.

623
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,500
Who's this Shravan now,
where he did he come from?

624
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,500
You only told that...

625
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,620
he'd come from an unexpected direction..

626
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,790
Hey..Where is she?

627
00:46:55,950 --> 00:46:56,540
She's inside.

628
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,160
Vaishali is inside the lab..
-you wait..

629
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:06,410
Vaishali..I've been sincerely loving you
since two years and you've always said no.

630
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,250
Why..?

631
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,790
I don't even have a chance to propose in the future..
I am leaving for New Zealand.

632
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:14,870
Why you are being so weird?

633
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:18,660
You continue to ask the same question
despite knowing the answer..It's always a no.

634
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,950
That's what I am asking you, why?

635
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:24,160
Actually, it's none of your business.

636
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:26,700
But still if you're curious, I've someone in my life now.

637
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,040
Yes, I heard you're seeing someone named Surya!

638
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:31,750
Oh..you imagined it that way!

639
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:34,910
Hello Vaishu.
-Surya.

640
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,870
Did you get to know anything about him?

641
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,700
I'm here for the same reason.

642
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:44,330
By the way, why are you here?

643
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,700
I've come here to tell the truth.

644
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:49,290
I'm not sure how would you react to it.

645
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,120
Tell me, it's okay

646
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:56,830
How would you react if you know that Lord Krishna and
Sisupala is none but the same guy in this love story?

647
00:47:58,330 --> 00:47:59,410
What do you mean?

648
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,830
You're angry..

649
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,080
I could sense it..I was asked to lie to you.

650
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,500
do they even deserve to be my friends?

651
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,540
Oh, a lie.

652
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:17,160
How mad would I be to tell you that
I'm both Lord Krishna and Sishupala.

653
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,200
There's no chance for that at all.
We can't be the same.

654
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,250
You were lying at me even for a petty anger.

655
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:28,450
Imagine my plight when you repeatedly
tell me you love that guy?

656
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,660
Wouldn't I be jealous? tell me.

657
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:33,540
What happened Shravan?

658
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:34,910
Come.

659
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,580
I don't know about you, but it looks like the other guy
is jealous seeing us converse regularly.

660
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,250
Who is he?

661
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,450
He'd just left..a senior named Shravan.

662
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,500
he'd dated my friend Latha for two years..
and the girl nearly committed suicide.

663
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:50,540
He's now chasing me..these guys should be killed.

664
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:55,290
But I'll be fine I think, he'll be in New Zealand tomorrow
and my problem should more or less be resolved.

665
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,410
It's a relief for me as well.

666
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,000
Hello

667
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,450
Your secret admirer has nearly killed me.

668
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:17,200
You could see me alive if you come soon.

669
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,790
Hope you'll come?

670
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,910
Oh my god, he's found the guy it seems.

671
00:49:35,410 --> 00:49:36,000
Where should I come?

672
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,540
Come down to Ballygunge football ground quickly.

673
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,080
Hi Bro...

674
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:46,370
Bro..

675
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,200
Who are these guys?

676
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:48,910
They're friends.

677
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:49,910
What's happening here?

678
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,370
Do you want an answer or want to beat them up?

679
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:53,830
Hey, take this.

680
00:49:57,250 --> 00:49:58,000
Hey...

681
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,080
Hey, stop you...

682
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,200
please..

683
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,200
Don't beat me..

684
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:06,950
Don't beat me..please.

685
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:08,370
Don't beat me..please.

686
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,790
Please.. Please.. Please.. beat me up.

687
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,370
Hey..don't hit me.

688
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:14,250
Hit him.. please.

689
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,750
Beat him
-He's finally smacked me.

690
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,080
Hey..don't hit me.

691
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,580
Oh God..! he is killing me.

692
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,870
Shravan..?

693
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,660
He didn't get hurt.

694
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,370
Smack him in a such a way that he doesn't get hurt.

695
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,370
smack him..

696
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,580
Oh my..he's whacking me..
he's ripping me apart..

697
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:47,410
Oh my..

698
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,500
He's here alone.and you guys are beating him up as a group.

699
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,450
Are you shameless?

700
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,000
Are you shameless?

701
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,700
Glad I'd just come in the nick of time.
-Yes Vaishu.

702
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:56,950
Hey..What's the fight all about?
-It's nothing..

703
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,040
Why have you all come together as a group then?
-Bye, Shravan

704
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:01,450
Oh no...

705
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:02,790
Why did you have a quarrel with them now Vaishu?

706
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:06,160
I'd already told you yesterday about my friend..
Latha, he was the guy I was referring to.

707
00:51:06,290 --> 00:51:07,870
If he's loving me...

708
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:10,870
and following me, what's your problem?

709
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,410
Did I ever tell you that I'm in love with you?

710
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:14,000
Why don't you reply?

711
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:16,750
What's your problem when Vaishu's loving me?

712
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:19,250
Why don't you reply...?

713
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,000
No problem brother.

714
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,080
I've a flight to catch, I'll get going.

715
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:26,700
What's this Vaishu?

716
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,200
He and you both don't have an issue if I love you.

717
00:51:30,410 --> 00:51:31,580
I too don't have any issue.

718
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,410
How wonderful would it be for us to love each other.

719
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,120
Vaishu..Vaishu..Imagine my plight
if you say no to my proposal?

720
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,200
Seriously, what will be your plight?

721
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,040
Should I lie or tell the truth?

722
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,500
First tell the lie.

723
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,000
I'll go mad.

724
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:48,410
The truth?

725
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:51,290
I never lie Vaishu..

726
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:09,410
Vaishu...

727
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,750
Hey..It's okay as long as you follow me.

728
00:52:11,950 --> 00:52:14,500
aren't you stretching things far when you
say you'd go mad without me?

729
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:16,330
Even I..had opined the same..Actually

730
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:17,910
Hello...

731
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:19,660
Hello...

732
00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:21,290
Hello Vaishu..

733
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:34,830
Today we will discuss about
Rheumatoid arthritis.

734
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,370
Rheumatoid factor.

735
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:38,870
Surya...

736
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:43,750
Hello..I know you wouldn't lie to me.

737
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:48,450
It's a quality that I like..
You think I could consider your proposal?

738
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:51,120
Yes..without any hesitation whatsoever.

739
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:05,660
Hello...

740
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,410
Hey..I'd forgotten about it last time around.

741
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:13,120
Why do you think I should like you?
I mean, what's so special about you?

742
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,910
I belong to ABO blood group.

743
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,200
Very rare blood group.

744
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,080
Only one in about a crore would possess it.

745
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:23,580
do you need any more reasons?

746
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,040
Isn't this funny?

747
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,000
Vaishu..is there something that
you want to tell me about?

748
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:06,000
Do you remember me asking about the exam to secure
an admission for a course in cardiology in London?

749
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,000
We have exam on that in the next week.

750
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,580
I expected something more important.

751
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:15,330
Oh yes..I nearly forgot about this..
I'm beginning to like a guy off late.

752
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,870
Is it?

753
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:18,660
It does sound interesting.

754
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:20,870
Who's he? ..What does he do?.. Where does he stay?

755
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,500
Too many questions dad..

756
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,330
They were only three of them..the questions

757
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:25,290
I don't know.

758
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:28,580
I'll call him over for lunch tomorrow,
why don't you directly ask him?

759
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,450
Dad...
-Yes.

760
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,120
Only you can convince mom.

761
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:36,080
Oh my..I can't do that..No

762
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,160
Dad please..please..please..

763
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:39,580
Let's see.

764
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,000
Thank you..

765
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,790
Hey..defend the ball..the ball

766
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,290
Hey..
-Hey..tell me Vaishu..

767
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:49,370
Why are you so scared of Shravan?

768
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,620
Some more guts would have suited your personality.

769
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,330
I don't know how would you survive in the future,
if left alone like this.

770
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,870
Aren't you there for me?

771
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,790
You're telling me everything but
for the reason you called me for...

772
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:09,410
Tell me once and I'll stick to your word
and be as loyal as your dog.

773
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:14,450
You're coming to my house for lunch tomorrow at sharp 1 pm.

774
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:16,790
Dad doesn't tolerate those who aren't punctual.

775
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,370
Where's the house with the number 7-50-54?

776
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:32,620
Vaishali's house right?

777
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,000
What's this hubbub for? Is anyone coming?

778
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,120
Don't ask me anything.

779
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:41,000
apparently, a special guest is due to arrive.

780
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,790
Did he tell you anything about the guest?

781
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,830
Not quite..As usual, I can't comprehend
most of your dad's words.

782
00:55:54,910 --> 00:55:57,330
Hey driver..stop the vehicle.. just a minute.

783
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:03,370
Stop it..did you recognise me?

784
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:05,040
Sir, it's you.

785
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:06,750
Thank God, you've recognised me

786
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,500
I've come here to meet a friend

787
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,160
In our colony?

788
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,580
This is my house, why don't you come over for a cup of coffee?
-Sir, I don't think this is necessary.

789
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,290
Just a cup of coffee
-I'll have coffee some other time.

790
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,500
You don't stand a chance, you can meet your friend anytime.

791
00:56:17,830 --> 00:56:21,080
I'm alive today only because of you!

792
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:28,750
My wife wouldn't spare me if I don't invite
a God-sent messenger like you to our house.

793
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,160
Sir, no, Sir.
-It's an order.

794
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:31,000
Please give me a minute sir.

795
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:32,700
Where are you Surya?

796
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,120
Dad's about to arrive, please come quickly.

797
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:36,290
Dad's about to arrive, please come quickly..

798
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,540
Let me convince her, give the mobile to me..
-I'm coming in a minute..

799
00:56:39,790 --> 00:56:41,120
I hope you're coming.
-Yes..I am.

800
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,370
Don't cheat me, this is an order.

801
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:50,000
Hey dad..looks like he's arrived.

802
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:56,120
Come.

803
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,080
Do you know who's here.

804
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:01,700
Who...?

805
00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:02,870
I can't recollect..sorry

806
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,040
Is he the one who rescued you from that bunch of goons?

807
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,580
Yes..that's true.

808
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,290
Hello Surya..Where are you..Dad has already reached.

809
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,580
I'm in the middle of a prayer..
I'll be there in five minutes.

810
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,200
See girl, you may not know me,
but he'll take at least half an hour to reach you.

811
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:24,370
Half an hour?

812
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,200
Hello...Hello... idiot.

813
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:28,040
Come..come.. my boy.

814
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,660
Please make yourself comfortable..
I'll be back in a jiffy.

815
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,870
So, this is my wall of fame.

816
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,700
Hello... It's with you.

817
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:40,450
Let me start with my Law college days.

818
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:44,040
Ofcourse...they are my certificates of verification.

819
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:44,750
Oh wow!

820
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:48,660
And you know what? I used to like playing the piano.

821
00:57:49,790 --> 00:57:52,200
And I must confess I was addicted to the instrument.

822
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:53,370
Trust me.

823
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:56,500
What?

824
00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:57,580
This is?

825
00:57:58,250 --> 00:57:58,870
This is?

826
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,290
The girl on the right is my elder daughter,
she now stays in the US.

827
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,160
And the girl on the left?
-The younger daughter..she's here.

828
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:05,200
I think I must leave.

829
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,330
Hey..where are you going?

830
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,080
No sir..I think I'll come sometime later.

831
00:58:08,250 --> 00:58:09,700
Just that you've come..meet her and go.

832
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:11,120
I'll be in serious trouble sir..

833
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,660
Let's call the emergency if that's necessary, now come over.
No sir..

834
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,080
There she arrives.

835
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,580
My daughter Vaishu..

836
00:58:19,370 --> 00:58:20,660
Oh..How true are Lord Krishna's words?

837
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,410
What is it?

838
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:22,750
That karma is a bitch.

839
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:29,330
Hello..this is Vaishali,

840
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:35,250
the girl who stood left in that frame and you should know him,
he's a gem of a boy, he's a very.

841
00:58:35,290 --> 00:58:36,750
Let me complete my sentence,

842
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:39,160
that day when the goons created a ruckus, he.
-Leave it sir, it's fine.

843
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:41,660
Can I decide that please?

844
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,410
He's that very God-sent messenger who
rescued me from the goons that day.

845
00:58:45,370 --> 00:58:47,000
weren't you there that day to notice it?

846
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:50,580
Only now, I've realised that
we can kill people with flattery too.

847
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:52,540
I think I shouldn't have saved you that day.

848
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:55,700
It's rare to find a guy like you these days.

849
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:57,790
could you come here once please?

850
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:01,040
Don't know What's her problem.

851
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,450
You speak to him.
I'll manage that.

852
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:06,870
Thank you.

853
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,450
I've been trying to tell this to you for long now.

854
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,870
Don't get confused.

855
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,910
My dad has devised a plan to convince my mom.

856
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:19,950
That you were the guy to have saved
my father from the goons.

857
00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:22,080
Ok, it's fine... you also managed it well.

858
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,080
What do you mean he's devised a plan?

859
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,200
Why would he lie?

860
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:29,870
It's a mistake.

861
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,580
Anyways,how could your family lie so spotaneously?

862
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,910
Damn...How?

863
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:36,950
how's this possible?

864
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,000
Why did you call me..?

865
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:41,330
Isn't the guy apt for our girl?
Why don't you ask about his caste?

866
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,620
I won't get a great chance to manage her.

867
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:44,750
What do you mean?

868
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,370
About Vaishu's marriage, is it?

869
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:50,450
Is it enough if you like him?
Wouldn't I have a say too?

870
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:53,950
Are you the one to marry him..
it's only Vaishu who needs to like him.

871
00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:01,080
You were about to say something..Vaishu?

872
01:00:01,870 --> 01:00:02,450
Now?

873
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,370
Shall we talk about it tomorrow?

874
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:09,000
Vaishu..
-Oh dad.

875
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:12,540
Vaishu, give me a high five.

876
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,870
I've somehow managed to convince your mom.

877
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:15,580
Is it?

878
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:16,580
Where's the boy..?

879
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:17,910
He's here..right here.

880
01:00:17,950 --> 01:00:20,000
I'll be in a soup now for sure.

881
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:20,950
Hey..you..

882
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:21,910
Oh he's seen me.

883
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:23,450
yes, sir..

884
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:26,330
Poor girl, I wasn't talking about this gentleman.

885
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,120
This is about Surya, it's already 1:30 pm, where is he

886
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,290
looks like, he doesn't have any punctuality.

887
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:34,660
Tell him I don't like it.
call him.

888
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:36,540
Son, I'm really sorry,

889
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:39,040
I kept you waiting, I suppose you had
to meet someone, please get going.

890
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:43,660
I'd never forget how you'd helped me that day,
would I be alive today without you?

891
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,080
I wouldn't have even existed.

892
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:49,040
Decided...I should repay your generosity in some form.

893
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,370
Sir, you've already done a lot for me.
you're not realising it.

894
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:53,660
I'll make a move sir.

895
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:54,450
Okay bye.

896
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,700
Vaishu..please send him off. go.

897
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,080
What's the time...

898
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,750
why don't you tell Surya it's 1:30 pm already?

899
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,160
Over ten people were chasing you..you got scared.
-Vaishu...

900
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:08,620
You made me a fool..nothing of it is true.

901
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,950
I should blame myself for swooning over a guy like you.

902
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:14,830
You'd told me to come down.

903
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,290
and now, you're sending me off even
without having a proper conversation.

904
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:18,660
why don't you talk it out?

905
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:19,700
I hate you.

906
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:24,200
When did you even love me to say 'I hate you' all of a sudden?

907
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:26,620
Hello sir.

908
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,910
I've come here only with Vaishali's insistence.

909
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:34,250
Get lost.

910
01:01:37,250 --> 01:01:41,080
Good afternoon and salutations ladies and gentlemen.

911
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,700
I've come here to present you something special,

912
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:47,660
Viewers and friends...keep your eyes glued and here we present,

913
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,870
Dil Se...

914
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,450
Hello..doctor, please rescue him..
he's had a heart attack..please..

915
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:54,790
What's the matter?

916
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:58,370
With all heart.. With all heart...

917
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:01,250
As I started from home.

918
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:03,370
I had a heart attack.

919
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:07,830
It was already late and the heart is fuming..with all heart..

920
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:11,000
With all heart.. With all heart...

921
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,330
So please take care of your tiny hearts.

922
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:16,410
Other than smoking, drinking and other food habits.

923
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:22,160
Betrayal... being cheated on.. lying...
can also cause heart failure.

924
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:25,080
Though it's to the left is always right, Okay

925
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,000
Any doubts?

926
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:29,040
Yes.

927
01:02:31,870 --> 01:02:32,410
Side please.

928
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,120
I hope everyone present in this show is a heart surgeon.

929
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:42,330
I mean you're all heart surgeons, right.

930
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:45,290
There's a problem with my heart.

931
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,450
I think the rhythm is missing at times
and my heart beats at a fast pace.

932
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:58,250
Some times..it also beats slowly.

933
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:00,370
This condition is called Heart Arrhythmia

934
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:01,910
Is it dangerous?

935
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:04,830
Of course it is..How long have you been facing it?.

936
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:11,160
Well..I think Jan 18, 2014, ever since I met Vaishu

937
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:14,830
Oh Vaishu..congratulations.

938
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,830
My heart has lost its control..Is it because of you?

939
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:27,830
It threatens to come to a halt without a yes from you.

940
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,000
Could you do something to cure it,

941
01:03:30,870 --> 01:03:34,370
won't it be an insult for the medicos
for me to die of a heart attack here?

942
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,660
Isn't it..?
-Yes..

943
01:03:36,870 --> 01:03:37,370
Yes..

944
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:39,910
Vaishu..

945
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:45,080
The heart is a child, it is a novice..

946
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:50,330
The heart is a child, it is a novice

947
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:51,540
I know I wasn't right.

948
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:53,910
But it was for whom?..Wasn't it for you?

949
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,910
Being a madcap girl that you've always been,
why would you even care for me?

950
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:00,910
Hey, Wow...

951
01:04:01,910 --> 01:04:03,910
Vaishu... you look so beautiful when you're angry..

952
01:04:05,370 --> 01:04:07,040
Wow....

953
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:21,660
I wanted to do this in a public place though I know it's wrong..

954
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:24,040
What else can I do?.

955
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,370
Vaishu...

956
01:04:35,660 --> 01:04:36,330
Vaishu...

957
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:38,160
Vaishu...

958
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:39,500
Vaishu...

959
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:40,580
Vaishu...

960
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,580
Hey...Here.

961
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:24,580
Go, take a step forward
My lips are on the move

962
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:29,330
In many different ways
Even as the heart says no...

963
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:37,750
The heart is experiencing a rare weariness...
Yet the lips crave for companionship.

964
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:42,580
The gloom disappears as the lips unite

965
01:05:42,620 --> 01:05:46,120
I nearly lose my life and yet recover again

966
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:57,120
The heart that rises after many a fall...

967
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:07,040
Even during a calamity
The heart seeks an acquaintance with the calamity

968
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:11,620
Don't you know this is all about you?

969
01:06:56,620 --> 01:06:59,870
Oh my love, isn't this strange?

970
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:04,250
Your warm hug doesn't let me experience the chills

971
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:14,200
When you're prisoned by me,
Aren't winters a season of warmth too?

972
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:19,040
Even a raindrop undertakes a penance to reach your skin

973
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:23,500
The spring season arrives in your footsteps

974
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:28,370
You've hurled at me
Words like a snare

975
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:31,660
Here begins my journey

976
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:43,120
The heart that rises after many a fall...

977
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:52,290
Even during a calamity
The heart seeks an acquaintance with the calamity

978
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:56,870
Don't you know this is all about you?

979
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:05,410
That one year went by like a breeze..

980
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:07,330
The story is beautiful indeed..

981
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:14,700
But I don't get what's the connection between Kolkata and
a place that's 800 km away from the city (Kathmandu)

982
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:20,370
The actual story is just about to begin..

983
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:25,870
Today we will talk about different types of Amnesia.

984
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:30,120
anterograde, retrograde, postromatic...

985
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:36,830
transient global people with this syndrome may present
with widely wearing degree of forgetfulness

986
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,370
we see a combination of...

987
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:40,950
Vaishali?

988
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,330
Yes sir..

989
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,290
Can you tell what is retrograde amnesia?

990
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:49,040
The loss of memory access to events or information...

991
01:08:49,200 --> 01:08:55,500
that was learnt before the accident or the
particular injury or the onset of the disease and.

992
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:57,410
Yes..What do you want?
-Vaishali.

993
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:02,120
Oh..I am dead meat!

994
01:09:03,620 --> 01:09:04,580
Why are you here..?

995
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:05,910
Baby...

996
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,450
see you soon..

997
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,370
Hey... help me.

998
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,870
You've finally come baby..

999
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:30,040
Yet again..do you plan to hug me publicly?
What do you think of yourself?

1000
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:32,450
I mean..it's been two days since we met.

1001
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,000
I didn't believe writer Devulapalli when
he'd said that every second

1002
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:37,410
minus the love of their lives feels
like another thousand years..

1003
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,290
Leave me now...
- I'm forced to believe him now.

1004
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:44,120
You're acting too weird when we
don't meet for even two days.

1005
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:47,290
Now I'm leaving for Nepal for a week's trip.

1006
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,290
How would you manage without me?

1007
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:52,410
Nepal?

1008
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:56,700
Poor boy..Why don't you ask the same writer for an advise?

1009
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,000
Okay, leave then.
-Surya..stop.

1010
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:34,910
Hey...

1011
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:37,330
Is it necessary for you to leave for Nepal..?

1012
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:42,200
I'd told you more than a hundred times now
that it's for a medical camp..

1013
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:43,790
You look really cute today.

1014
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:56,870
What If I need it again...?

1015
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:02,120
Why don't you come to Nepal?

1016
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:07,200
That won't be right.

1017
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:08,250
Oh no..Dad.

1018
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:11,200
Oh my demoness.
How many more days should I wait for?

1019
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,580
Sailu..We have checked this witness..okay..

1020
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,830
Vaishu...
-What...?

1021
01:11:46,370 --> 01:11:47,450
Why are you here.?

1022
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,370
You'd only told me to come whenever I may...

1023
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,000
Kiss me now..

1024
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,540
Why does your professor seem jealous looking at us together?.

1025
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,000
Wait at the coffee shop, I'll be there in a while..

1026
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:07,620
I won't.
-I'll come.

1027
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:08,370
I can't wait.

1028
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,410
Give me two minutes.
-I just can't wait.

1029
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:14,750
Hopeless..

1030
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:15,620
Come soon.

1031
01:12:22,290 --> 01:12:24,250
Hey..sor...

1032
01:12:36,700 --> 01:12:37,700
Are you shameless?

1033
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:40,540
Don't you even have common sense to say sorry?

1034
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:42,580
Culture less fellow.

1035
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:45,250
What you said..?

1036
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:52,200
You'd called me culture less?
I don't have anyone to teach me culture.

1037
01:12:52,290 --> 01:12:53,160
What do I do?

1038
01:12:53,830 --> 01:12:57,500
Hey Surya, what has gotten into you?..what are you doing?.

1039
01:12:57,910 --> 01:13:01,450
Sir, you're the author Vivek Ravipati.

1040
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:04,620
Surya, do you even know who he is?

1041
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:07,750
I am so sorry about his behaviour.
-It's Okay.

1042
01:13:08,160 --> 01:13:10,870
I am a big fan of your work..I regularly read all your books.

1043
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:12,500
Thank you so much.

1044
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,120
but I am sorry for everything that has happened.

1045
01:13:30,290 --> 01:13:31,830
What, are you still angry?

1046
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:38,620
Look at them, how happy are they?

1047
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,120
That idiot doesn't know that his life
would be an empty book in the future.

1048
01:13:44,410 --> 01:13:47,000
What do you mean?

1049
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,200
Won't we be happy if we get married?

1050
01:13:49,290 --> 01:13:52,950
Come, let's get married now..
I'll see how your life changes for the worse.

1051
01:13:54,370 --> 01:13:55,660
I will stick here.

1052
01:13:57,540 --> 01:13:58,200
Marriage?

1053
01:13:58,830 --> 01:13:59,700
What are you talking?

1054
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:01,790
Hey, wait.

1055
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,660
You don't seem to be in a good mood today.
let's talk about this tomorrow.

1056
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:06,500
what do you feel?

1057
01:14:06,660 --> 01:14:09,410
Aren't we happy like this? Why do we need to get married?

1058
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:10,200
We're happy now right.

1059
01:14:11,330 --> 01:14:13,620
We're happy, yes but I'm greedy.

1060
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:17,120
I want to be much more happier..I need more of this.

1061
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,660
I need more of this.
-Then we should never get married.

1062
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:20,950
provided you want us to be happier.

1063
01:14:22,910 --> 01:14:24,160
Stop joking Surya.

1064
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:27,700
Do you mean that we would forever
be together and yet not get married?

1065
01:14:27,950 --> 01:14:28,660
I think so...

1066
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:36,040
Surya...

1067
01:14:37,790 --> 01:14:38,870
Surya, wait.

1068
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,950
I'm not against live-in relationships
but I am uncomfortable about it.

1069
01:14:43,450 --> 01:14:44,250
What's wrong.

1070
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:46,370
Oh... correct.

1071
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:51,950
Marrying you and making a claim
that you're mine works for me.

1072
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:56,370
But why do we need the permission
of the society to stay together?

1073
01:14:56,410 --> 01:14:58,910
Tell me, what's your issue with marriages?

1074
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,450
The very idea of marriage itself.

1075
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:04,500
Do you notice how many couples are
happy after getting married?

1076
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:06,120
Nothing.

1077
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:08,870
Every one is acting that they are happy.

1078
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:12,500
What are you talking Surya?

1079
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:17,500
Won't we stay happy if we get married?.

1080
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:25,330
Why will people stay together in a marriage
even when they aren't happy?

1081
01:15:25,950 --> 01:15:26,750
Compromise.

1082
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:31,120
No marriage would survive if the couple doesn't
agree upon a few compromises and adjustments.

1083
01:15:32,500 --> 01:15:36,370
Why are you talking of getting married
when I'm saying we're happy this way?

1084
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,160
Don't irritate me with your talk on marriage.

1085
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,290
I'm trying hard.

1086
01:15:52,410 --> 01:15:54,580
but I'm just not able to understand you as a person.

1087
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:55,330
Hey...

1088
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,000
Why don't you get this?

1089
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:02,870
Even my parents loved each other and got married.

1090
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:05,160
Out of the blues,

1091
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:12,370
My dad remembered about his career and left mom.

1092
01:16:12,910 --> 01:16:13,830
Infront of mine.

1093
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:23,040
Why didn't the very concept of
marriage keep them together then?

1094
01:16:25,410 --> 01:16:27,580
That's why one shouldn't get married
if the two plan to stay together all their lives...Vaishu

1095
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,910
we should only marry when we can't live without each other.

1096
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:38,910
My dad didn't quite feel that and even
I frankly don't feel it with you today.

1097
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:44,160
Is there any assurance that you'd also not say this in this future?

1098
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:45,450
You can't.

1099
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:49,200
This one reason tells us why we shouldn't marry.

1100
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,500
To behave like my dad... understood.

1101
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:01,370
I'm really trying to understand you Surya..but..

1102
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:02,620
How should I explain you then?

1103
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:05,290
I was mad to not understand this before.

1104
01:17:06,870 --> 01:17:09,950
A distance between us, has grown apart more than ever before.

1105
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,660
This isn't working out..

1106
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:16,250
let's break up Vaishu.

1107
01:17:23,540 --> 01:17:24,500
Wait Surya.

1108
01:17:26,870 --> 01:17:27,950
listen to me once.

1109
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:34,450
Do you even realise the outcome of your words?

1110
01:17:35,330 --> 01:17:37,790
Why should we break up at the very thought
that we won't stay together in the future?

1111
01:17:38,410 --> 01:17:41,540
This is blasphemy, why don't you understand?

1112
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:42,790
How..?

1113
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,910
You're not understanding my intentions
and I'm not convinced by yours either.

1114
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:48,000
Let's stop this here.

1115
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:52,700
We'll repent about this decision,
maybe for days, months or a year at best.

1116
01:17:53,250 --> 01:17:55,290
we'll get used to it later.

1117
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,080
You're right Surya.

1118
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:17,290
We should marry only when we can't live without each other.

1119
01:18:23,160 --> 01:18:25,120
To realise it, we need to break up.

1120
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:34,620
I'm leaving for Europe next month..To do my PG course.

1121
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:41,540
We'll live in different countries,

1122
01:18:43,290 --> 01:18:44,370
won't communicate through calls,

1123
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,450
no messages...

1124
01:18:51,450 --> 01:18:55,120
and we won't be a couple, as you'd intended us to be.

1125
01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:12,410
If either of us feel the need to revive this relationship,
let's meet in this very location next year.

1126
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:20,410
Just give it a thought, I'll be waiting for you.

1127
01:19:21,450 --> 01:19:22,330
And if you won't?

1128
01:19:31,540 --> 01:19:34,160
It would've been a year without each other,

1129
01:19:35,660 --> 01:19:38,750
we'll get used to being alone.

1130
01:19:51,790 --> 01:20:00,870
It took a year's time and a 800 km journey to Nepal
to realise my deep-rooted love for Vaishali.

1131
01:20:01,370 --> 01:20:03,830
No girl would bother to return to you after that conversation.

1132
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:07,410
that too a doctor, I don't see any hope..

1133
01:20:08,910 --> 01:20:09,620
She willn't come.

1134
01:20:10,830 --> 01:20:12,120
Please don't say that..

1135
01:20:13,290 --> 01:20:16,330
I've almost prepared to kill myself in case she doesn't come.

1136
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:25,620
I might not even think twice in
killing you if you utter those words again.

1137
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:28,160
please don't let me do that sir.

1138
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,370
You'll smack me?

1139
01:20:37,830 --> 01:20:40,620
You've cracked a very good joke.

1140
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:39,500
Sir...

1141
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:41,080
Sir...

1142
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:44,000
Sir...

1143
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:08,160
Sir, be careful., are you fine now?

1144
01:22:19,290 --> 01:22:20,000
Sir...

1145
01:22:21,450 --> 01:22:22,410
What were you telling a few minutes before?

1146
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:25,700
Were you telling she wouldn't return again?

1147
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:29,000
She won't come...
-Thank you sir..thanks..

1148
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:34,000
She wouldn't have come for sure..
-Thank you sir..

1149
01:23:38,330 --> 01:23:40,160
Dad look at these pigeons.

1150
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:48,250
Wait Surya, I need more, more than this

1151
01:23:48,330 --> 01:23:49,580
You aren’t understanding me

1152
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:51,450
I’m not going to be convinced by you.

1153
01:23:52,250 --> 01:23:54,910
It isn’t going to work out, let us break up Vaishu

1154
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:21,290
Dad...

1155
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:23,370
Dad...

1156
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,660
Dad...

1157
01:24:34,370 --> 01:24:35,500
Dad...

1158
01:24:36,040 --> 01:24:37,200
Dad...

1159
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,870
Surya...

1160
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:08,330
Surya...

1161
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,290
Surya...

1162
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:36,160
Just because your dream is headed here,
Just because this appears your destination.

1163
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:43,410
Don't tread this path, my love!

1164
01:25:52,250 --> 01:26:00,250
Just because your dream is headed here,
Just because this appears your destination.

1165
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:07,500
Don't tread this path, my love!

1166
01:26:07,790 --> 01:26:14,540
Would you want to be enveloped by darkness all around?

1167
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:23,040
Would you want your heart to
be stranded in the middle of a forest?

1168
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:48,910
Oh my beloved trust!
Don't try to stick to your words!

1169
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:56,250
We've a wealth of memories together!
Oh my rosy past!

1170
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:08,000
As a temple on the verge of ruin,
Should I welcome you?

1171
01:27:08,200 --> 01:27:15,160
Despite realising this isn't an ideal time,
should I take a step ahead?

1172
01:27:15,870 --> 01:27:20,120
Should I ask you how long would
this pangs of separation be?

1173
01:27:20,250 --> 01:27:21,830
Surya...

1174
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:28,000
Surya...

1175
01:27:31,370 --> 01:27:32,950
Surya...

1176
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:53,370
Around 1900 die in earth quake in Nepal,
thousand stuck in the rubble

1177
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:55,250
Surya, don’t touch

1178
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:58,040
She is coming to India after a year,
instead of coming home straight.

1179
01:27:58,410 --> 01:27:59,000
Get up.

1180
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:02,750
She goes to meet a friend, he nods in approval.

1181
01:28:03,450 --> 01:28:06,540
None in the family have the common sense to inform me.

1182
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:09,290
She too doesn’t have the sense to call me over the phone.

1183
01:28:09,330 --> 01:28:11,160
What is Ingitham (common sense)?
-You shut up

1184
01:28:11,830 --> 01:28:13,410
Did Vaishali call?

1185
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:14,700
Don’t make me talk

1186
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,200
Have you taken a vow not to talk?

1187
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:18,200
Settle the marriage discussion as soon she comes

1188
01:28:19,540 --> 01:28:21,580
Didn’t you tell it is her wedding and it is her wish?

1189
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:23,120
I regret saying that, okay?

1190
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:26,950
We got the eldest one married to your side of the family,
now get Vaishali married to Venkatrao’s son.

1191
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,200
My nephew is coming from America next month.

1192
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:33,000
Who that Chatur Ramalinga?
She will never marry. Take my word.

1193
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:34,040
Hey...

1194
01:28:51,080 --> 01:28:51,870
Sir...

1195
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:55,080
Please help me, I need to call Vaishali

1196
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:55,910
come with me.

1197
01:29:00,410 --> 01:29:01,000
Hello...

1198
01:29:01,040 --> 01:29:02,620
I am Surya, Is Vaishali there?

1199
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:09,950
We were just discussing about her marriage with
my nephew next spring, you understand?

1200
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:12,290
Vaishali agreed?

1201
01:29:12,330 --> 01:29:13,910
Vaishali need to agree right?

1202
01:29:14,040 --> 01:29:17,410
Why won’t she....the boy is a doctor plus
he is from America

1203
01:29:18,910 --> 01:29:19,500
Hello...

1204
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,830
Hey you come here, bring him here

1205
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,620
Sir..Vaishali hasn’t come.

1206
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,000
She hasn’t come...

1207
01:29:43,330 --> 01:29:44,040
Yes.

1208
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:51,910
A second back I was very happy when I learnt she hasn’t come.

1209
01:29:53,870 --> 01:29:58,790
Even if she had come what would have happened?
At the most we would have died.

1210
01:29:59,660 --> 01:30:08,580
I am getting angry and hurt at the same time
after having learnt of her marriage.

1211
01:30:09,450 --> 01:30:10,750
Hey Surya, listen

1212
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:24,250
Surya...

1213
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:27,910
Surya...

1214
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,660
Need doctors..need doctors

1215
01:30:52,580 --> 01:30:55,160
Yeah I am fine... I am bleeding a bit.

1216
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:58,200
But it's fine. I am serious along.
That's Okay.

1217
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:05,620
Can I please make an emergency call...
-Yeah sure.. but please make it fast.

1218
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:11,620
Hello...

1219
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:14,250
Hello Surya...
-Vaishu, how are you?

1220
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:15,910
Where are you?

1221
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:22,910
At home.

1222
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,080
Just going out with Padma.

1223
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:29,080
Anything important?

1224
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,620
By the way how did you think of us suddenly?

1225
01:31:43,700 --> 01:31:46,330
Called just to know if you are safe

1226
01:31:46,790 --> 01:31:47,870
I’m safe.

1227
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:51,450
The earthquake took place in Kathmandu, not in Kolkota.

1228
01:31:53,370 --> 01:31:57,660
Did you go to Nepal for me?

1229
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:20,330
Thank you.

1230
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:27,250
Who drew this.

1231
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:29,080
The girl who saved my life.

1232
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,200
Is it her.

1233
01:32:33,500 --> 01:32:34,830
Do you know her.

1234
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:40,790
Vyshali.

1235
01:32:41,660 --> 01:32:43,250
Say thanks to her.

1236
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:46,580
Vaishu...

1237
01:32:46,620 --> 01:32:48,540
Surya hasn’t come to Nepal, Shalini

1238
01:32:48,790 --> 01:32:54,450
Don’t worry, whatever happens is for the good
wonder what would have happened if he came

1239
01:32:54,910 --> 01:33:00,040
At the most we would have died, that’s all.

1240
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,120
I need my phone.

1241
01:33:01,250 --> 01:33:02,540
Vaishu... hello.

1242
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:03,830
Thank you.

1243
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:10,330
Vacate this place

1244
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,700
Vaishu...

1245
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:14,040
Do it fast

1246
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,450
Vaishu...
-Do it fast.

1247
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:18,370
Do it fast
-Vaishu...

1248
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:23,080
Run, fast....got to run

1249
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:52,830
Vaishu...

1250
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:55,000
Vaishu...

1251
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:58,250
Vaishu...

1252
01:34:02,540 --> 01:34:05,910
Hello... grandpa...

1253
01:34:11,790 --> 01:34:12,330
Slowly...

1254
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:17,910
Slowly...

1255
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:23,500
Careful... be careful.

1256
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,250
Dad, I’ll be really fine

1257
01:34:31,410 --> 01:34:33,370
We’ll go home if the doctor says the same

1258
01:34:33,410 --> 01:34:35,250
Am I not the best doctor, you know

1259
01:34:35,410 --> 01:34:36,250
Doctor please...

1260
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,700
How is your Delhi girl friend Rakesh

1261
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:39,790
I moved on

1262
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,330
Excuse me, what do you want?

1263
01:34:56,370 --> 01:34:58,410
Did anyone by the name Vaishali get admitted?

1264
01:34:58,450 --> 01:34:59,160
One minute

1265
01:34:59,910 --> 01:35:00,580
Please...
-Hey Surya,

1266
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:03,370
you are still here?

1267
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:04,120
Sir...

1268
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,330
What happened?
-Vaishali came.

1269
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:06,750
but don’t know where she is

1270
01:35:06,830 --> 01:35:10,080
Let us hunt for her.

1271
01:35:10,910 --> 01:35:13,040
I’ll find out. You stay here...

1272
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:15,040
From where?
-Indian citizen register

1273
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:16,410
Okay sir, take this.

1274
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:21,040
Hey Surya, Vaishali is safe

1275
01:35:21,660 --> 01:35:24,580
she is fine right? Where is she, take me please

1276
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:28,040
She is in Kolkota, her dad took her

1277
01:35:29,450 --> 01:35:30,120
Thank you sir

1278
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:32,370
Hey, take your vehicle.

1279
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:33,500
See you sir.

1280
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:43,080
Are you looking for Surya?

1281
01:35:43,700 --> 01:35:45,120
He did not come.

1282
01:35:48,200 --> 01:35:49,750
He went on a road trip.

1283
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:56,910
His mother too doesn’t know.

1284
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:05,120
Shalini...
-Uncle.

1285
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:05,830
Take her inside

1286
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:08,620
Stay for some more time
-Okay

1287
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,660
Maybe it isn’t right pining for one person.

1288
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:26,080
I feel low. I too have self respect.

1289
01:36:29,160 --> 01:36:32,750
There is no person called Surya in my life.

1290
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,580
He doesn’t deserve me, you know.

1291
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:38,370
Vaishu...

1292
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:44,500
Vaishu...Don’t think too much.

1293
01:36:45,540 --> 01:36:47,120
I will leave to Europe Shailu.

1294
01:36:48,160 --> 01:36:49,950
There is enough time for that.

1295
01:36:50,580 --> 01:36:57,410
To come out of his thoughts and become normal again,
you need to occupy with something.

1296
01:36:58,830 --> 01:37:02,120
Will talk to you tomorrow, take rest.

1297
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,460
Surya...
-Aunty..Is Vaishali there?

1298
01:37:22,630 --> 01:37:23,590
She has gone to the college.

1299
01:37:26,050 --> 01:37:28,880
Thank you somuch for having me here Sir
on such a short notice.

1300
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,250
You are welcome Vaishali.

1301
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:32,590
You have been a good student of this college.
-Thank you Sir.

1302
01:37:32,630 --> 01:37:33,500
Okay...
-Okay Sir.

1303
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:35,630
It's just a matter of time Vaishu, trust me.

1304
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,920
See how you will forget Surya

1305
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:39,550
I have already moved on

1306
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:41,050
How are you Vaishali Madam

1307
01:37:41,090 --> 01:37:41,920
after so many years.

1308
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:49,000
Surya Bhai... Vaishali madam has left to the railway station.

1309
01:37:54,590 --> 01:37:57,920
Yeah I know...Vaishnu...Surya?

1310
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:07,800
I've escaped death...must have come to console me.

1311
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:12,800
Or else, he has come to convince me that
he had been to Nepal for me.

1312
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:18,300
I lack patience to bear his lies.

1313
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:21,750
Please convey whatever I said to him in a way he understands.

1314
01:38:22,340 --> 01:38:26,250
I don't understand what you say,
how am I supposed to convey all this to him?

1315
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:30,500
If he has to stay away from me, this is correct.

1316
01:38:33,130 --> 01:38:33,880
Sorry.

1317
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:38,500
He is your friend?

1318
01:38:39,550 --> 01:38:41,420
Hi, I am Vaishali.

1319
01:38:43,170 --> 01:38:48,050
Oh, in that case, I am Ilayaraja

1320
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,050
So nice,

1321
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:52,670
I'm getting late, I will leave. Bye

1322
01:38:56,250 --> 01:38:57,880
Vaishu...wait.

1323
01:38:58,210 --> 01:39:00,460
I lied to you that I stayed
at home thinking you weren't in Nepal.

1324
01:39:02,340 --> 01:39:04,750
Are you upset because I was with Padma?

1325
01:39:05,090 --> 01:39:07,090
Padma is my mother. ..did you forget?

1326
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:12,210
We should have married on that day
you wanted to...but it isn't late.

1327
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:14,590
There is a registrar office close by, let us go and get married.

1328
01:39:14,710 --> 01:39:15,960
Come Vaishu... please.

1329
01:39:16,130 --> 01:39:16,840
Come please.

1330
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:18,000
Who are you boss?

1331
01:39:18,090 --> 01:39:20,460
Are you mad, what marriage are you talking about?

1332
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,050
Whom do you think you are talking to?

1333
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:34,590
Surya, I need to talk with you.

1334
01:39:35,460 --> 01:39:36,210
It is my fault.

1335
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:38,920
I was made to ask for a break up...

1336
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:43,340
but does that mean she is not going to recognise me ?

1337
01:39:44,550 --> 01:39:47,250
I don't know how to tell you,

1338
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,880
She is not the previous Vaishali.

1339
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:55,750
she lost some part of her memory due to
the injury she sustained during the earth quake.

1340
01:39:58,170 --> 01:39:58,710
What?

1341
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:02,210
It is retrograde amnesia in medical term

1342
01:40:02,710 --> 01:40:03,500
Retrograde?

1343
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:04,840
Amnesia....

1344
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,630
She won't remember any of her memories.

1345
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:17,340
She can't recollect many happenings related
to her despite an effort.

1346
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:21,920
You are one amongst those acquaintances,
Now she doesn't know you.

1347
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:25,000
Hey what are you talking? Are you mad?
Why will she forget me?

1348
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:27,710
Believe it or not but that is the truth

1349
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,670
She doesn't know you.

1350
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:31,300
She doesn't know me?

1351
01:40:42,590 --> 01:40:44,210
You have to believe the fact.

1352
01:40:44,380 --> 01:40:45,880
You are just a stranger to her.

1353
01:40:50,590 --> 01:40:53,550
don't try to help her recollect her past. It is risky.

1354
01:40:55,250 --> 01:40:57,340
It is better you begin a new life and move on.

1355
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:00,300
Please move on.

1356
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:07,170
Hello...
Hello Vaishu.

1357
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,670
Being a doctor, you made another doctor lie.

1358
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:12,300
It was very hard to manage him.

1359
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,380
Did he leave as soon as you spoke all that

1360
01:41:14,750 --> 01:41:16,000
Actually he was shocked.

1361
01:41:16,380 --> 01:41:19,210
He probably thought it wouldn't be
good crying in my presence.

1362
01:41:20,210 --> 01:41:21,840
Hey, already you are here.

1363
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:24,210
when did you come..?

1364
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:30,550
Did he leave immediately...as soon as you spoke

1365
01:41:34,340 --> 01:41:36,750
I empathised with him.

1366
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:40,630
I don't think he will come to you anymore.

1367
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:47,840
I have been thinking of him for a year.

1368
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:53,500
Shalini... How can he give upon me so easily?

1369
01:41:56,460 --> 01:41:57,340
Vaishu...

1370
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:00,500
I went to Nepal pining to see him...

1371
01:42:00,550 --> 01:42:04,210
It is okay if he did not go to Nepal..
at least he came now, you should consider him.

1372
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:12,880
Oh yeah..he came.

1373
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,590
But left when you said I lost memory

1374
01:42:18,920 --> 01:42:23,840
Isn't that what you want...to have Surya out of your life?

1375
01:42:25,500 --> 01:42:33,800
Yes, but it pains when
I learn that he left immediately.

1376
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:35,710
Hey

1377
01:42:36,670 --> 01:42:38,130
Tell me Surya

1378
01:42:41,300 --> 01:42:43,460
You said something some time back

1379
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:48,960
That is...

1380
01:42:49,130 --> 01:42:51,130
You are just a stranger to her...

1381
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:57,750
Vaishali forgot me completely...

1382
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:02,500
and she wont remember me
if I appear in front of her..right?

1383
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,880
You have seen that.

1384
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:06,920
Her memories...

1385
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:12,710
You are not there in her memories.

1386
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:16,920
Why are you laughing?

1387
01:43:17,750 --> 01:43:19,800
So I can begin loving her all over again from tomorrow?

1388
01:43:21,050 --> 01:43:21,920
I don't understand

1389
01:43:22,670 --> 01:43:25,670
She will understand from tomorrow.

1390
01:43:54,170 --> 01:43:55,340
Since how long he's been missing?

1391
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:57,460
Sign here.
-Since ten days

1392
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:00,170
Don't worry, we will make an inquiry

1393
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:02,750
What happened?

1394
01:44:04,130 --> 01:44:06,130
See, your son has arrived

1395
01:44:06,550 --> 01:44:07,090
Go...

1396
01:44:07,210 --> 01:44:07,960
Do you have any sense?
-Mom...

1397
01:44:08,130 --> 01:44:09,710
What will I think if you leave without informing.

1398
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:10,800
Couldn't you call once?

1399
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:12,590
next time I will break your legs if you leave home.
-Listen to me mom.

1400
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:14,960
Had to go to a trip suddenly..listen to me mother

1401
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:15,800
Please...

1402
01:44:16,130 --> 01:44:16,920
Mother...please

1403
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:19,960
Mother...Mother... road...

1404
01:44:29,800 --> 01:44:31,250
Did you understand.

1405
01:44:33,090 --> 01:44:34,340
How can she forget just like that.

1406
01:44:34,590 --> 01:44:38,420
You went behind her, one year you pined for her,

1407
01:44:38,630 --> 01:44:41,590
you leaving for Nepal..she forgot all that

1408
01:44:43,050 --> 01:44:49,500
She doesn't remember who Surya is, so how will
she know who went behind her, fell for her..?

1409
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:55,130
So what will you do now?

1410
01:44:55,300 --> 01:44:56,090
Only one option...

1411
01:44:58,420 --> 01:44:59,710
Will try for her again

1412
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:05,880
So are we going to run again?

1413
01:45:06,340 --> 01:45:07,130
Yes.

1414
01:45:15,170 --> 01:45:16,380
If Queen comes, it is a Show

1415
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:19,880
It is a Show if King comes

1416
01:45:29,460 --> 01:45:31,250
Without rain effect, it is same to same...

1417
01:45:31,670 --> 01:45:32,880
All same to same.

1418
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:41,380
Please save me,

1419
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:46,170
(Indistinct Voices...)

1420
01:45:59,710 --> 01:46:00,840
Stop...stop.

1421
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:04,130
Ask her..

1422
01:46:04,170 --> 01:46:06,670
Did someone escape from here?

1423
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:11,170
This way

1424
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:12,880
Run...
-Thanks

1425
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:16,880
Hey, stop you...

1426
01:46:16,920 --> 01:46:18,170
Come here guys

1427
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:22,340
You said same to same, but this girl has reversed

1428
01:46:22,420 --> 01:46:23,550
Her father is a judge.

1429
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,460
What do you know? we are getting scared.
-What happened...?

1430
01:46:26,630 --> 01:46:27,460
You didn't find him?

1431
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:28,340
Where are you going?

1432
01:46:28,920 --> 01:46:30,550
I am hunting....

1433
01:46:31,250 --> 01:46:33,590
That fellow, he sneaked into that street..

1434
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:37,380
(Indistinct Voices...)

1435
01:46:39,880 --> 01:46:41,210
How much amount was robbed...?

1436
01:46:42,170 --> 01:46:43,800
Hey, wait you....

1437
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:49,670
He is a police?

1438
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,050
What is our position now?

1439
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:52,670
He might strip us and beat

1440
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:54,130
Why did you people run into this place?

1441
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:59,210
We were practicing football

1442
01:46:59,250 --> 01:47:01,090
Shall I help you with a good practice?

1443
01:47:07,750 --> 01:47:09,050
It's good for us.

1444
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:10,420
He only entered into our den.

1445
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:14,130
Let us not wait for a good time,
let us go beat him black & blue

1446
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:15,670
We can come and play later.

1447
01:47:21,960 --> 01:47:25,380
Can't you see me... nonsense.
-You go that side.

1448
01:47:30,250 --> 01:47:30,920
Where are you guys?

1449
01:47:37,050 --> 01:47:38,130
You got into our hands in a correct time.

1450
01:47:38,250 --> 01:47:41,880
When did you all make an entry in this confusion.
I am in irritation... get lost.

1451
01:47:41,960 --> 01:47:43,920
Why discuss when we kill and go fast.

1452
01:47:44,090 --> 01:47:45,550
We left our work there in between.

1453
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:47,840
What...?
-this is our profession.

1454
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:48,420
what...?

1455
01:47:48,460 --> 01:47:50,800
won't you let us do our work?
-What work are you talking about?

1456
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:54,380
Won't you let me do my work ?

1457
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:56,750
How can she forget me?

1458
01:47:58,050 --> 01:47:59,210
How can she forget me?

1459
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:03,550
Loving her all over again is so difficult you know?

1460
01:48:04,340 --> 01:48:05,130
Who?

1461
01:48:05,170 --> 01:48:06,960
You know that?

1462
01:48:14,460 --> 01:48:15,250
Hit me..

1463
01:48:16,550 --> 01:48:17,130
hit me

1464
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:19,840
He is telling you to hit...so do it now.

1465
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:25,590
Hit me.

1466
01:48:33,590 --> 01:48:34,630
Hit me hard

1467
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:38,710
Excuse me

1468
01:48:44,250 --> 01:48:44,840
Hey...

1469
01:48:45,800 --> 01:48:47,710
even if people are hitting and killing me
right in front of your eyes.. you don't seem to care

1470
01:48:49,630 --> 01:48:50,340
I am asking you.

1471
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,420
Who are you to me that I should take a risk?

1472
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:02,420
Friend, relative or a brother?

1473
01:49:02,590 --> 01:49:03,130
Boyfriend...

1474
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,170
You didn't understand?

1475
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:10,880
Though it is a bit confusing in the beginning,
you will get connected in the journey.

1476
01:49:11,630 --> 01:49:13,500
By the way I am Karthik

1477
01:49:14,380 --> 01:49:14,840
See you.

1478
01:49:26,590 --> 01:49:27,460
King...

1479
01:49:28,170 --> 01:49:29,050
Queen...

1480
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:30,630
you know what you have become?

1481
01:49:33,380 --> 01:49:34,170
You...

1482
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:37,500
Joker.

1483
01:49:40,590 --> 01:49:43,840
After your framed story, we thought Surya will disappear.

1484
01:49:44,090 --> 01:49:48,380
He came back as Karthik and seems to
be quite stubborn in wooing you...

1485
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:50,340
He is a real hero.

1486
01:49:51,750 --> 01:49:53,670
So am I a villain?

1487
01:49:54,880 --> 01:50:03,590
You used medical terminology to ward him off
but what if he gets to know you were lying?

1488
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:04,750
How will he know?

1489
01:50:06,340 --> 01:50:09,210
No one gets a grade without proper preparation.

1490
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:16,550
How will you convince him that you have retrograde
amnesia without proper research?

1491
01:50:16,840 --> 01:50:19,460
Where is our coffee? How long has it been?

1492
01:50:19,710 --> 01:50:23,630
Brother..it has been half an hour since
we ordered coffee, where is it?

1493
01:50:23,670 --> 01:50:27,300
You just had...did you forget?

1494
01:50:32,050 --> 01:50:33,000
Forgot.

1495
01:50:38,420 --> 01:50:39,460
Amnesia isn't it?

1496
01:50:40,710 --> 01:50:43,840
You are not an ordinary actor

1497
01:50:44,460 --> 01:50:46,670
Even God also cannot catch you...

1498
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,250
Are you waiting for me?

1499
01:51:08,590 --> 01:51:11,630
You don't have any work other than roaming around girls?

1500
01:51:12,170 --> 01:51:15,840
Sir..aren't you football player Karthik?

1501
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,170
Your goal yesterday was...went mad

1502
01:51:19,210 --> 01:51:20,550
Shut up.
-Just wait.

1503
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:22,050
Is madam your girl friend?

1504
01:51:22,420 --> 01:51:24,090
madam..you are very lucky.

1505
01:51:24,380 --> 01:51:26,630
They are planning to make him captain of the next Bengal team.

1506
01:51:27,130 --> 01:51:28,920
He has elevated the power of Telugu people.

1507
01:51:29,090 --> 01:51:30,670
Madam, sir..one selfie.

1508
01:51:30,710 --> 01:51:31,710
sir..one selfie.

1509
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:39,590
Why did she throw it?

1510
01:51:40,380 --> 01:51:41,880
Anger.

1511
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:45,250
But she need to throw you, for all that over action.

1512
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:48,130
If mine is over acting...what is yours?

1513
01:51:48,420 --> 01:51:51,000
Sorry, my friend went a bit over board in praising.

1514
01:51:51,090 --> 01:51:53,340
Did he expect me to fall...if he praises you?

1515
01:51:54,210 --> 01:51:57,250
Why will you fall if he praises me, you will fall if you look down

1516
01:52:12,500 --> 01:52:13,300
leave me.

1517
01:52:15,250 --> 01:52:17,880
If I leave you, you might fall. I meant ..down

1518
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:19,670
Don't leave don't leave please.

1519
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:23,380
You will fall...even if I don't leave you..

1520
01:52:23,710 --> 01:52:26,800
I mean for me.

1521
01:52:38,710 --> 01:52:40,800
Hey... here it seems change of colors.

1522
01:52:43,170 --> 01:52:47,340
look at this, Surya is actually the
captain of the Bengal foot ball team.

1523
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:53,050
your acts are confusing, the other day you rejected Surya

1524
01:52:53,210 --> 01:52:54,460
I am saying the same now too

1525
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:56,380
Doesn't look like that too others.

1526
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:57,750
At least me.

1527
01:52:58,500 --> 01:53:00,000
What wrong did he do?

1528
01:53:03,210 --> 01:53:04,130
Loving me

1529
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:09,670
Tell this to him...not me

1530
01:53:14,800 --> 01:53:15,960
Congratulations.

1531
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:17,750
looks like my friend is a big sports star.

1532
01:53:17,960 --> 01:53:21,670
Hello... I don't need a promotion as a friend.

1533
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:24,920
The other day didn't you say a boy friend's post is enough.

1534
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:27,250
Don't be worried about not falling for me.

1535
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:28,630
You will, that's my responsibility.

1536
01:53:31,090 --> 01:53:32,050
You will fall.

1537
01:53:37,630 --> 01:53:41,090
you finish your shopping and come,
I will meet Rakesh.

1538
01:53:41,130 --> 01:53:41,920
Bye.

1539
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:48,710
No parking

1540
01:53:51,880 --> 01:53:52,590
Hello...

1541
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:54,160
Hi... Doctor Rakesh?

1542
01:53:54,250 --> 01:53:55,750
Are you Dr Vaishali
-Yeah

1543
01:53:55,870 --> 01:53:56,790
He is waiting for you

1544
01:53:57,120 --> 01:53:58,500
Room Number?

1545
01:53:58,540 --> 01:53:59,160
Thank You.

1546
01:54:00,870 --> 01:54:01,790
Hi Rakesh

1547
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:02,620
Hey Vaishu...

1548
01:54:03,910 --> 01:54:04,700
You are looking great.

1549
01:54:04,790 --> 01:54:05,580
Thank you...

1550
01:54:06,250 --> 01:54:07,830
Enough...sit

1551
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:12,080
We are fixed it... lift up.. lift up.

1552
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:14,450
Lift it... move... move.

1553
01:54:14,580 --> 01:54:15,950
Fast... make it fast.

1554
01:54:17,620 --> 01:54:19,080
Hey Surya...
-Move... move.

1555
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:21,250
Hey, Surya...
-The work for which I came here is done.

1556
01:54:21,290 --> 01:54:21,910
Sir, please stop.

1557
01:54:21,950 --> 01:54:22,370
I am very happy

1558
01:54:22,410 --> 01:54:23,200
Surya...

1559
01:54:23,290 --> 01:54:25,250
you are such a baddie... you know that.
-I know.

1560
01:54:25,410 --> 01:54:27,330
That is my car.
-I know.

1561
01:54:27,830 --> 01:54:29,540
I and Vaishu on a small ride,

1562
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:32,410
your car will be at your place by evening.

1563
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:34,000
Here is the keys.

1564
01:54:34,120 --> 01:54:35,160
There is the taxi..

1565
01:54:35,830 --> 01:54:36,830
Taxi...Taxi...

1566
01:54:41,950 --> 01:54:42,450
Yes...

1567
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:43,290
He came here too.

1568
01:54:46,330 --> 01:54:49,500
Excuse me how did I come here?

1569
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:54,450
I remember coming in the car but I can't trace it.

1570
01:54:54,830 --> 01:54:58,950
I came by a flight and I parked it
somewhere here but I can't find it.

1571
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,120
These people come early in the morning,
wonder where they come.

1572
01:55:02,540 --> 01:55:05,700
If you remember where you need to go, I can drop you

1573
01:55:07,370 --> 01:55:09,120
Oh God... what a heavy weight.

1574
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:09,950
Sure...

1575
01:55:10,450 --> 01:55:12,120
Lets go...
-Yes, lets go.

1576
01:55:12,250 --> 01:55:13,040
Expensive bikes weigh more.

1577
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:14,160
Hey... hey...

1578
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:18,120
Move... move... loading is done.

1579
01:55:27,330 --> 01:55:28,120
Tram

1580
01:55:28,830 --> 01:55:30,450
Kishore kumar song in a tram background...

1581
01:55:31,450 --> 01:55:35,160
and Vaishali besides me...what a combination.

1582
01:55:37,200 --> 01:55:39,000
How many girls did you floor with such sweet talk?

1583
01:55:39,290 --> 01:55:40,290
Only you...

1584
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,830
in my previous birth.

1585
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:47,290
I say this with Kishore Kumar as the witness,
you don't remember but I do.

1586
01:55:47,370 --> 01:55:48,370
Are you a Telugu person?

1587
01:55:49,540 --> 01:55:50,750
I saw you somewhere sir.

1588
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:53,500
No chance, you must have seen me in my past life.

1589
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:55,620
Not past life you crazy fellow, just the other day

1590
01:55:55,660 --> 01:55:56,580
I am saying no.

1591
01:55:57,250 --> 01:55:58,410
Can't be you for sure.

1592
01:55:58,450 --> 01:56:00,410
Do any girls fall for such rowdy guys?

1593
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:01,950
Your face.

1594
01:56:03,080 --> 01:56:07,620
What I meant is there is no similarity between
both of you though you look alike.

1595
01:56:08,330 --> 01:56:11,250
She is an arrogant devil,

1596
01:56:11,540 --> 01:56:13,000
you can't estimate her arrogance.

1597
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:16,330
Her thoughts get me irritated.

1598
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:17,160
I can't

1599
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:20,290
do you have a heart, whom are you cursing?

1600
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:22,370
Why are you getting affected when I call her names?

1601
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:24,450
If I abuse that old 'you',

1602
01:56:24,700 --> 01:56:26,790
it means I am capable of taking care of this
present you in the past.

1603
01:56:27,500 --> 01:56:29,000
I wouldn't let even a fly fall on you.

1604
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:29,620
Damn...

1605
01:56:29,790 --> 01:56:35,370
I am reminded of that day when you beat the pulp
of some rowdies who teased her in the train.

1606
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:38,660
You are correct she is more than arrogant, wonder why!

1607
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:41,250
She is my old girlfriend

1608
01:56:42,870 --> 01:56:44,120
aren't these girls the same?

1609
01:56:44,950 --> 01:56:46,040
She is my new girl friend

1610
01:56:46,410 --> 01:56:47,660
Both of them are the same sir

1611
01:56:47,830 --> 01:56:49,450
We both are aware of that

1612
01:56:49,540 --> 01:56:50,330
What about the girl?

1613
01:56:50,410 --> 01:56:50,950
She don't know.

1614
01:56:51,660 --> 01:56:52,500
Her chip conked.

1615
01:56:53,080 --> 01:56:53,790
My steth....

1616
01:56:57,200 --> 01:57:00,040
You are just not arrogant, you are always
anxious, you got down before I gave it to you

1617
01:57:02,500 --> 01:57:03,700
What do you plan to do with it

1618
01:57:03,830 --> 01:57:05,250
My mother is not keeping good health

1619
01:57:20,160 --> 01:57:20,830
Sorry...

1620
01:57:21,950 --> 01:57:23,410
and thanks.

1621
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:26,000
Surya...
-yes.

1622
01:57:26,370 --> 01:57:30,370
When she is refusing to that extent,
how do you love her so much?

1623
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:34,410
She forgot Surya here. Not here.

1624
01:57:36,370 --> 01:57:42,580
She is hurt a great deal for having forgotten him,
and she is not able to express it.

1625
01:57:43,290 --> 01:57:45,000
You are really such a baddie guy.

1626
01:57:48,370 --> 01:57:48,950
Surya...

1627
01:57:49,870 --> 01:57:52,950
Vaishnu's cousin is arriving next week.

1628
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,750
If everything falls in place,
he will marry her and take her to America.

1629
01:57:59,950 --> 01:58:02,580
Felt like sharing it with you.

1630
01:58:04,330 --> 01:58:05,250
Alright see you.

1631
01:58:12,160 --> 01:58:12,950
Yeah, Alex...

1632
01:58:13,250 --> 01:58:15,120
Just reached my aunt's home to get married.

1633
01:58:15,410 --> 01:58:18,000
Yeah of course with Vaishali.
You guys should all come.

1634
01:58:18,040 --> 01:58:18,750
Ramu

1635
01:58:18,870 --> 01:58:19,790
I will call you back.

1636
01:58:20,250 --> 01:58:21,580
Are you coming now...come...come

1637
01:58:21,620 --> 01:58:22,500
Yes..just now

1638
01:58:23,250 --> 01:58:24,910
After going to America, you turned fair

1639
01:58:25,040 --> 01:58:26,750
I have already discussed everything about your marriage.
-Sister, how is Vaishali?

1640
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:28,910
If I promise, it is enough..it is as good as getting married.
-You haven't changed at all aunt,

1641
01:58:28,950 --> 01:58:30,410
and uncle must have lost weight listening to your words

1642
01:58:30,450 --> 01:58:34,120
Chatur Ramalingam from America, did you arrive just now?

1643
01:58:34,200 --> 01:58:34,870
Yes uncle.

1644
01:58:35,290 --> 01:58:39,250
Where is Vaishali, it has been ages since
I have seen here. I'm dying to see her

1645
01:58:39,540 --> 01:58:40,330
Is it...

1646
01:58:42,370 --> 01:58:44,290
Here she is...

1647
01:58:45,370 --> 01:58:46,160
we shall meet later

1648
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:48,540
Isn't she pretty?

1649
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:50,910
why did you give her photo? Isn't she at home?

1650
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:55,580
It is just 5 pm. By the time she
reaches home, it will be midnight.

1651
01:58:56,450 --> 01:58:57,450
We are used to this.

1652
01:58:57,660 --> 01:58:59,620
You refresh and eat.

1653
01:59:00,120 --> 01:59:05,790
Came to India to marry thinking it is normal in America,
but if it has become normal in India too..what do I say?

1654
01:59:22,790 --> 01:59:24,040
I like it,

1655
01:59:24,370 --> 01:59:29,290
since I don't have a reaction like this...
I came to get married from California to Kolkatta.

1656
01:59:29,330 --> 01:59:32,040
Stop joking , thanks for the coffee

1657
01:59:32,750 --> 01:59:35,000
Vaishu, come on. I am ready.

1658
01:59:37,160 --> 01:59:38,250
He is the one...

1659
01:59:39,080 --> 01:59:41,290
what do I do...I am coming

1660
01:59:45,120 --> 01:59:45,910
wait.

1661
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:50,330
Uncle if you move a bit away, I will get to speak to Vaishali

1662
01:59:50,370 --> 01:59:51,160
okay, carry on.

1663
01:59:52,870 --> 01:59:57,950
You know Vaishu, during childhood we would run
to school this way and you would come first

1664
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:04,040
Brother-in-law, mom said we studied together
but I don't remember

1665
02:00:04,790 --> 02:00:05,750
Till 6th class.

1666
02:00:05,790 --> 02:00:07,620
From then onwards I started liking you

1667
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:10,620
What did you see in me in 6th class?

1668
02:00:10,790 --> 02:00:12,790
You would never lie at all, isn't that enough?

1669
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:16,040
Sister, how are you?

1670
02:00:16,370 --> 02:00:17,330
you didn't recognise me.

1671
02:00:17,580 --> 02:00:21,250
I was in the train that day, next day rakhi...

1672
02:00:23,080 --> 02:00:25,080
how is brother in law, good?

1673
02:00:25,120 --> 02:00:26,450
I am fine...
-Convey my regards.

1674
02:00:29,080 --> 02:00:30,160
Confused fellow.

1675
02:00:33,120 --> 02:00:35,910
I am there besides you, he should have asked me directly.

1676
02:00:36,700 --> 02:00:38,120
Your brother lacks clarity

1677
02:00:44,830 --> 02:00:48,500
Why are you crying dad?

1678
02:00:50,660 --> 02:00:53,620
This generation girls have turned heartless.

1679
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:58,160
How can she say she forgot the
guy whom she loved on his face?

1680
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:00,120
Worst generation.

1681
02:01:01,750 --> 02:01:03,410
Whom are you talking about?

1682
02:01:04,040 --> 02:01:04,950
About me.

1683
02:01:05,370 --> 02:01:06,870
Thank You
-It is okay

1684
02:01:15,660 --> 02:01:17,330
My daughter Vaishali..you know right?

1685
02:01:17,370 --> 02:01:18,160
I know sir

1686
02:01:20,540 --> 02:01:24,700
she is the doctor who turned me into a patient,
how will I forget her

1687
02:01:26,620 --> 02:01:30,410
Vaishu... It should be a punishable offence

1688
02:01:30,450 --> 02:01:31,410
Punishable offence.

1689
02:01:32,700 --> 02:01:35,410
How can you arrive at a judgement listening
to a one side argument?

1690
02:01:35,580 --> 02:01:37,040
Tell me what is your argument about

1691
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,450
You..
-Karthik

1692
02:01:42,700 --> 02:01:43,700
Chatur...

1693
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:47,540
what is the connection between your
judgement and Vaishali's argument?

1694
02:01:47,580 --> 02:01:48,540
Vaishali is calling.

1695
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:51,200
You can listen to the story while jogging

1696
02:01:51,250 --> 02:01:53,700
For today...this is enough

1697
02:01:54,160 --> 02:01:54,950
Dear...

1698
02:01:58,160 --> 02:02:00,290
Who is the fortunate girl who has claimed to have forgotten you

1699
02:02:00,330 --> 02:02:01,790
If you know who she is, you'll die of cardiac arrest.

1700
02:02:02,120 --> 02:02:04,160
Why should I have a heart problem if I get to know
something about your girl friend

1701
02:02:04,200 --> 02:02:05,410
I meant she is very beautiful

1702
02:02:05,500 --> 02:02:06,290
Sir..

1703
02:02:08,080 --> 02:02:08,870
sister...

1704
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:10,080
You have known him before?

1705
02:02:10,450 --> 02:02:14,330
No, by his talk I could grasp that
he is the brother of my future wife.

1706
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:16,330
You both came together?

1707
02:02:16,370 --> 02:02:18,250
We met only after coming here..what sir?

1708
02:02:18,540 --> 02:02:19,160
Yes sir

1709
02:02:19,410 --> 02:02:22,750
I met sister and inquired about you.
-I was standing besides her, saw.

1710
02:02:23,540 --> 02:02:24,910
I am talking about him.

1711
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:26,370
I am talking about her.

1712
02:02:26,750 --> 02:02:27,750
You are getting confused,

1713
02:02:27,830 --> 02:02:29,370
I am talking about both of them

1714
02:02:29,700 --> 02:02:30,950
I'll kill you

1715
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:35,120
I'll kill you if you keep creating relationships
with the intention of making money.

1716
02:02:35,750 --> 02:02:39,080
Don't presume he is innocent and alone, I am with him.

1717
02:02:39,120 --> 02:02:40,120
What sir?
- Yes sir

1718
02:02:40,200 --> 02:02:43,450
I have changed sir.
-Go..go.

1719
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:44,950
Go...he is telling right?

1720
02:02:46,700 --> 02:02:49,410
Cool sir, cool... forgive me

1721
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:50,790
Why sir?

1722
02:02:51,370 --> 02:02:56,200
He was trying to tell me some truth, I misunderstood you...
presuming you were stopping him from talking.

1723
02:02:56,660 --> 02:02:58,830
Please accept my apologies.

1724
02:02:59,870 --> 02:03:00,910
Thanks for saving me.

1725
02:03:01,700 --> 02:03:03,830
Okay Chatur... Okay.

1726
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:05,370
Okay.

1727
02:03:05,660 --> 02:03:06,750
Poor guy, he is hurt.

1728
02:03:08,500 --> 02:03:09,290
A for...

1729
02:03:11,370 --> 02:03:12,160
Apple

1730
02:03:16,160 --> 02:03:16,790
P for

1731
02:03:19,040 --> 02:03:20,790
P for...
-Phone

1732
02:03:21,410 --> 02:03:22,910
Phone.
-Good girl

1733
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:26,790
Hi Rakesh
-why late?

1734
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:27,950
Same reason

1735
02:03:30,450 --> 02:03:32,540
Surya alias Karthik.

1736
02:03:34,410 --> 02:03:39,410
Don't know how to distance myself from him,
he keeps on following me

1737
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,290
Marry me, your problem will be solved

1738
02:03:43,040 --> 02:03:46,660
Joke, you can laugh, no one will beat you

1739
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:48,790
If you joke in that manner, none will fall for you

1740
02:03:49,540 --> 02:03:51,080
You are coming to tomorrow's seminar right?

1741
02:03:51,540 --> 02:03:55,950
So Psychotherapy is a first line treatment
for people with border line personality and behaviour.

1742
02:03:56,290 --> 02:03:58,120
There are two types of personality disorders

1743
02:03:58,330 --> 02:04:00,950
One is normal and other one is eccentric.

1744
02:04:01,950 --> 02:04:04,330
But we have researches Who are trying to solve this as well

1745
02:04:05,700 --> 02:04:07,660
so let’s get going to with cluster ‘ B’ then

1746
02:04:07,870 --> 02:04:11,700
cluster ‘B’ generally includes dramatic overly emotional

1747
02:04:12,540 --> 02:04:13,910
On know to pre-emptively attack
other when they feel
threatened...

1748
02:04:13,950 --> 02:04:14,580
Hi...

1749
02:04:15,200 --> 02:04:15,830
Hi...

1750
02:04:15,950 --> 02:04:17,790
What... you tagged your cousin along?

1751
02:04:18,160 --> 02:04:21,250
He was getting bored at home, so got him along.

1752
02:04:24,540 --> 02:04:26,750
Wonder how to identify our doctor from the rest.

1753
02:04:28,080 --> 02:04:29,950
Hey..my phone.

1754
02:04:31,540 --> 02:04:32,370
How come you are here?

1755
02:04:32,580 --> 02:04:34,620
I need to be there amidst the crowds, my job responsibility

1756
02:04:35,080 --> 02:04:36,410
Who are you..?
-Doctor Surya

1757
02:04:36,450 --> 02:04:37,290
Doctor Bhonsle

1758
02:04:37,370 --> 02:04:39,250
Under the kidney there is a....
-He is gone

1759
02:04:39,910 --> 02:04:42,120
Did you get to see our doctor

1760
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,540
New doctor or the old one.

1761
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:46,700
They are the same right...there

1762
02:04:46,830 --> 02:04:48,540
Look at that, oh god

1763
02:04:51,080 --> 02:04:52,040
My God.

1764
02:04:58,290 --> 02:05:00,160
Vaishu, can you please look at this file

1765
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:03,410
It is better to leave early,
otherwise you will bump into some idiot.

1766
02:05:04,200 --> 02:05:08,410
I mean... Idiots are around and
more over she is with momery loss.

1767
02:05:09,120 --> 02:05:12,540
Hello, there can’t be a bigger idiot than me in Kolkata.

1768
02:05:14,620 --> 02:05:16,540
All these days I thought idiot was an abuse.

1769
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,200
All this is fine.

1770
02:05:18,910 --> 02:05:21,450
Brother-in-law what is this, you can’t wear a tie ?

1771
02:05:21,870 --> 02:05:22,790
Fine listen...

1772
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:24,450
Those reading which ever we took were fine

1773
02:05:24,540 --> 02:05:27,330
You just send it to the chief Doctor
then I will comfirm it with you.

1774
02:05:27,540 --> 02:05:28,290
Okay..

1775
02:05:28,540 --> 02:05:30,000
Okay fine, then I will cross check.

1776
02:05:31,330 --> 02:05:32,700
What is this...like a kid

1777
02:05:33,580 --> 02:05:36,580
Sister is over acting because you are watching doctor.

1778
02:05:37,040 --> 02:05:38,080
Is it.

1779
02:05:40,250 --> 02:05:44,250
She is overacting because you are not watching her

1780
02:05:44,290 --> 02:05:45,870
Now do you want me to watch or not?

1781
02:05:45,950 --> 02:05:46,910
Let us throw a toss.

1782
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:54,660
Actually we both are comfortable with each other

1783
02:05:54,870 --> 02:05:57,370
I think...
-He is over acting.

1784
02:05:59,450 --> 02:06:03,660
So why don’t we take the relation to the next level.

1785
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:05,370
shall we marry.

1786
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:09,580
I can feel your pain doctor, it is time for your rounds

1787
02:06:09,910 --> 02:06:10,750
it is

1788
02:06:12,080 --> 02:06:13,580
Sorry Brother-in-law, you were saying something

1789
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:16,540
It is English right, emotion vanishes.

1790
02:06:17,580 --> 02:06:21,250
It will be good if we marry Vaishu.

1791
02:06:22,830 --> 02:06:24,250
Thanks for coming.. catch you later.

1792
02:06:24,370 --> 02:06:25,620
Brother-in-law you were saying something

1793
02:06:26,250 --> 02:06:29,120
You didn’t understand that in Telugu too.

1794
02:06:29,330 --> 02:06:34,500
No, even if you speak in Hindi
I won’t understand, what will you do.

1795
02:06:35,330 --> 02:06:36,410
Chatur...
-Karthik.

1796
02:06:37,160 --> 02:06:40,330
You are here...?
-You came alone or with a girl friend?

1797
02:06:41,330 --> 02:06:42,790
I am talking to her...

1798
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:46,580
on the phone.

1799
02:06:48,250 --> 02:06:49,870
You were talking to her right, carry on

1800
02:06:50,040 --> 02:06:50,910
I forgot.

1801
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:51,870
Tell me.

1802
02:06:54,200 --> 02:06:57,290
No English or Telugu. From tomorrow we shall speak in Tamil

1803
02:06:57,410 --> 02:06:59,370
What do you mean speaking in Tamil?

1804
02:06:59,450 --> 02:07:01,330
Whatever it is, the matter has to be settled now.

1805
02:07:01,500 --> 02:07:03,410
You are arrogant because you are taller than me.

1806
02:07:04,910 --> 02:07:08,250
Phone sir....you talk sir...talk

1807
02:07:08,330 --> 02:07:09,120
Okay.

1808
02:07:09,410 --> 02:07:10,200
I forgot again...

1809
02:07:11,160 --> 02:07:11,790
Where is she...?

1810
02:07:11,910 --> 02:07:12,750
can I tell tomorrow

1811
02:07:13,790 --> 02:07:16,120
Vaishu Vaishu...
-Hey Rakesh.

1812
02:07:17,410 --> 02:07:19,870
We were supposed to meet, we didn’t . Busy?

1813
02:07:21,160 --> 02:07:22,290
Doctor Surya

1814
02:07:22,790 --> 02:07:24,660
Yes Doctor Jayakrishna

1815
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:30,120
Did you find it difficult playing with innocent people’s
lives since childhood or did it start growing growing...

1816
02:07:30,450 --> 02:07:32,450
Hunger,...what do we do

1817
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:33,750
Meals ready

1818
02:07:33,830 --> 02:07:34,910
Did he come
-He came

1819
02:07:35,080 --> 02:07:37,540
Karthik...
-Yes, what sir

1820
02:07:37,620 --> 02:07:38,750
You will have to help me

1821
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:40,160
Anytime Chatur..tell me

1822
02:07:40,330 --> 02:07:44,290
Though I am besides Vaishali, her eyes
are always hunting for someone else.

1823
02:07:44,830 --> 02:07:48,750
She talks to me but she listens to someone else.

1824
02:07:48,910 --> 02:07:51,080
Focus doctor.
-Yes.

1825
02:07:51,950 --> 02:08:06,330
So you doubt that her eyes are always
looking for me and she is all ears to me?

1826
02:08:09,330 --> 02:08:17,120
I don’t doubt you love her but
I doubt Vaishali loves someone.

1827
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:21,500
Whom

1828
02:08:22,660 --> 02:08:23,910
That is for you to discover

1829
02:08:24,080 --> 02:08:24,830
Right

1830
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:28,910
Sorry for the interruption ...
do you ask knowingly or unknowingly?

1831
02:08:28,950 --> 02:08:29,910
To know

1832
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,910
You know whom you are asking?

1833
02:08:31,950 --> 02:08:34,700
I am new to this village, so he got to help me..what Karthik?

1834
02:08:35,160 --> 02:08:35,950
True

1835
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:37,910
Where are you going Karthik?

1836
02:08:39,330 --> 02:08:40,750
I am on the job Chatur
-Oh...Okay.

1837
02:08:41,040 --> 02:08:41,750
Nice fellow.

1838
02:08:41,830 --> 02:08:43,040
Who...
-Karthik.

1839
02:08:48,540 --> 02:08:50,040
Are all your NRI doctors like this?

1840
02:08:50,200 --> 02:08:51,250
I studied in India.

1841
02:08:51,290 --> 02:08:53,000
You studied in India but don’t come to India...

1842
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:55,660
because here people are knocked off their lives and wallets.

1843
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,370
You won’t find despite the search

1844
02:08:58,330 --> 02:09:00,160
Second nice fellow

1845
02:09:00,250 --> 02:09:02,580
Rakesh...please don’t do this to me

1846
02:09:02,620 --> 02:09:06,700
Vaishu how do I explain this to you,
I don’t care even if you think it is a warning.

1847
02:09:07,410 --> 02:09:08,700
Telling you one last time...

1848
02:09:09,040 --> 02:09:14,290
whether Surya loves you or you love him,
the one facing the problem will be you.

1849
02:09:17,580 --> 02:09:19,580
Why are you troubling me?

1850
02:09:20,040 --> 02:09:23,040
Don’t forget that...

1851
02:09:24,660 --> 02:09:25,450
I’ll take leave

1852
02:09:35,830 --> 02:09:36,620
Who is he?

1853
02:09:37,620 --> 02:09:39,790
Listen...not today

1854
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:43,950
You seem to be in tension, don’t worry.

1855
02:09:44,120 --> 02:09:45,410
Didn’t I tell you it is my responsibility to make you fall.

1856
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:47,040
Has everything got to be connected with you?

1857
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:49,040
Stop stalking me

1858
02:09:49,700 --> 02:09:51,450
Are you mad?

1859
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:53,450
Why are you behaving like this.

1860
02:09:54,330 --> 02:09:57,330
You appear close but you are so far that
I can’t reach you.

1861
02:09:58,500 --> 02:09:59,660
I hate to let you go you say.

1862
02:09:59,830 --> 02:10:02,410
In another second you want me out of your life.

1863
02:10:02,620 --> 02:10:04,660
I don’t understand your mind.

1864
02:10:06,200 --> 02:10:12,450
If forgetting is your problem, I’ll take care of you

1865
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:15,080
Why don’t you understand..forget me

1866
02:10:15,160 --> 02:10:17,870
What madam, any problem?

1867
02:10:21,660 --> 02:10:24,120
Who are you..what do you want?

1868
02:10:24,370 --> 02:10:25,290
I want her.

1869
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:28,330
you can’t give right...so you leave.

1870
02:10:29,080 --> 02:10:37,830
Where have I lost you..Even as I'm with you

1871
02:10:38,500 --> 02:10:47,700
What will I become..without you

1872
02:10:52,660 --> 02:10:57,080
I've filled every page in my book with you

1873
02:10:57,120 --> 02:11:02,040
You've thrown the book aside even without opening it

1874
02:11:02,410 --> 02:11:11,620
You're that breath of fresh air flowing within me
Yet you've taken my breath away

1875
02:11:12,120 --> 02:11:16,370
I don't want to part ways with you

1876
02:11:16,580 --> 02:11:21,580
Its only with your thoughts i’m alive

1877
02:11:21,830 --> 02:11:26,660
I've lost a part of myself to you,
Though I know this,

1878
02:11:26,700 --> 02:11:31,160
I can't leave you

1879
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:36,120
Where have I lost you..

1880
02:11:36,370 --> 02:11:39,750
Even as I'm with you

1881
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:49,910
What will I become..without you

1882
02:12:09,830 --> 02:12:19,000
Where should I go when you're all around me
Your heart is where I reside

1883
02:12:19,080 --> 02:12:28,660
I only dream about you
Please don't turn into a dream.

1884
02:12:28,950 --> 02:12:33,450
You're the boon that helps me overpower death

1885
02:12:33,580 --> 02:12:38,540
Don't be the venom that separates me from you

1886
02:12:38,580 --> 02:12:47,580
Where have I lost you.. Even as I'm with you

1887
02:12:47,870 --> 02:12:57,660
What will I become..without you.

1888
02:12:57,830 --> 02:12:59,500
How many times I told you not to call me..?

1889
02:12:59,790 --> 02:13:02,910
Don’t you understand.
I don’t like you at all

1890
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:04,500
Why you are irritating me so much...

1891
02:13:04,580 --> 02:13:05,700
Don't call me ever.

1892
02:13:06,540 --> 02:13:07,580
Hi, Karthik.

1893
02:13:08,370 --> 02:13:09,620
I told you something,
What did you do about it?

1894
02:13:09,790 --> 02:13:12,120
Vaishali, she must be loving someone truly.

1895
02:13:12,950 --> 02:13:14,370
No one is that fortunate here,

1896
02:13:15,580 --> 02:13:17,120
really you are lucky boss.

1897
02:13:26,510 --> 02:13:27,470
Mom...

1898
02:13:28,430 --> 02:13:30,220
Sister, my daughter in law is calling you

1899
02:13:30,640 --> 02:13:31,350
Mom...

1900
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:33,510
What..?
-Did you see my file?

1901
02:13:33,800 --> 02:13:37,010
You asked me 100 times now, I’ll punish you if you ask again

1902
02:13:46,470 --> 02:13:47,180
Brother-in-law...

1903
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:51,260
Brother-in-law...

1904
02:13:51,720 --> 02:13:52,930
Did you see my file?

1905
02:13:53,010 --> 02:13:55,720
It’s been a week since I saw you, how will I see your file?

1906
02:13:56,510 --> 02:14:01,220
I have been wanting to ask you something for a week now,
but you aren’t available

1907
02:14:02,300 --> 02:14:06,970
I know what you want to ask, our marriage won’t happen

1908
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:17,890
Why?

1909
02:14:18,180 --> 02:14:19,890
I am already committed

1910
02:14:20,010 --> 02:14:23,600
You are lying..aren’t you?
Tell me truth.

1911
02:14:24,220 --> 02:14:25,050
You are lying right...?

1912
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:27,100
You know I don’t lie.

1913
02:14:28,510 --> 02:14:30,430
Does aunt know about your commitment?

1914
02:14:30,640 --> 02:14:31,510
No

1915
02:14:31,600 --> 02:14:33,720
Uncle?
-He knows

1916
02:14:35,220 --> 02:14:38,050
Infact dad knows the guy I loved

1917
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:52,850
Dad, can you come here once?

1918
02:14:57,180 --> 02:14:57,890
What..?

1919
02:14:58,600 --> 02:14:59,930
This marriage won’t happen

1920
02:14:59,970 --> 02:15:00,550
Why?

1921
02:15:00,640 --> 02:15:01,970
Vaishali is in love with someone

1922
02:15:02,300 --> 02:15:03,010
I don’t believe.

1923
02:15:04,430 --> 02:15:05,720
she is lying.

1924
02:15:06,260 --> 02:15:08,140
Don’t show your intelligence to me.

1925
02:15:08,680 --> 02:15:11,890
I gave a word to aunt that Vaishali will be my daughter in law.

1926
02:15:12,300 --> 02:15:13,390
That is final

1927
02:15:16,300 --> 02:15:18,470
Ramu..you liked the girl?

1928
02:15:19,260 --> 02:15:21,300
You liked the girl...

1929
02:15:21,850 --> 02:15:22,970
don’t give us tension

1930
02:15:27,180 --> 02:15:31,470
Aunt has clue about what’s happening here,
she is just asking with curiosity.

1931
02:15:31,970 --> 02:15:34,640
My dad has half knowledge, refuses to listen.

1932
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:37,470
You know the entire story, why give us tension.

1933
02:15:37,720 --> 02:15:39,680
What are you saying, I can’t understand?

1934
02:15:40,430 --> 02:15:41,890
Vaishali is in love with someone

1935
02:15:43,140 --> 02:15:43,720
Who...?

1936
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:45,550
You already know him

1937
02:15:48,640 --> 02:15:52,260
These days she forgets to tell me many things.

1938
02:16:06,350 --> 02:16:07,600
Chotu what happened?

1939
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:10,930
A football player met with an accident, he won’t survive

1940
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:13,100
He won’t survive

1941
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:14,350
Paper...paper.

1942
02:16:22,640 --> 02:16:25,760
Do you know where Shalini is, she isn’t taking the call

1943
02:16:25,850 --> 02:16:31,100
She is in the OT, emergency case.
Some football player met with an accident.

1944
02:16:31,470 --> 02:16:33,300
Unfortunately he has a Bombay blood group

1945
02:16:33,350 --> 02:16:36,300
What..Bombay blood group?

1946
02:16:49,430 --> 02:16:50,260
What happened?

1947
02:17:06,430 --> 02:17:07,390
What happened?

1948
02:17:10,720 --> 02:17:16,300
I was worried when they said it was
Bombay blood group foot ball player.

1949
02:17:17,720 --> 02:17:19,510
But I am so happy he is not him.

1950
02:17:21,550 --> 02:17:22,800
What happened to you.?

1951
02:17:23,600 --> 02:17:25,390
If you bump into him, you scold him...

1952
02:17:25,640 --> 02:17:28,800
Now you are worried that he might
have met with an accident.

1953
02:17:29,720 --> 02:17:30,760
What is your problem?

1954
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:37,430
You are spoiling your life just because
he did not come to Nepal.

1955
02:17:37,890 --> 02:17:39,300
you are showing him hell.

1956
02:17:42,260 --> 02:17:45,550
My Surya came to Nepal for me.

1957
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:47,720
Vaishu...

1958
02:17:49,180 --> 02:17:50,050
Vaishu...

1959
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:52,220
Vaishu...

1960
02:18:08,430 --> 02:18:10,550
Why did you hurt him knowing he came to Nepal

1961
02:18:14,890 --> 02:18:20,680
If every strike happens with an intention of hurting,
then the world would have ended in a mother’s womb.

1962
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:31,850
When did you come?
-I don’t remember

1963
02:18:32,890 --> 02:18:33,850
How are you feeling now?

1964
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:38,850
I’m very happy,

1965
02:18:40,140 --> 02:18:43,180
Getting vanished with my old memories means...

1966
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:46,260
How lucky am I..

1967
02:18:49,010 --> 02:18:54,720
Even dad got to know my retrograde amnesia,

1968
02:18:56,550 --> 02:18:58,720
he looked broken..

1969
02:18:59,350 --> 02:19:04,260
Now the thought of forgetting Surya kills me

1970
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:07,510
Try to destract yourself from his thoughts.

1971
02:19:09,010 --> 02:19:11,100
It is impossible.

1972
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:21,430
If Surya gets to know of my amnesia he will flee
I thought but he said he will make me fall.

1973
02:19:22,010 --> 02:19:23,180
He did it.

1974
02:19:25,100 --> 02:19:34,760
Every time I deny myself I fall in love with him,

1975
02:19:36,390 --> 02:19:38,600
he doesn’t give me a choice.

1976
02:19:40,600 --> 02:19:43,100
Now tell which stage am I in?

1977
02:19:47,800 --> 02:19:52,050
Hippocampal atrophy... 40% already sunk

1978
02:19:52,890 --> 02:19:54,600
Can you explain in a way I understand

1979
02:19:57,470 --> 02:20:07,220
All the memories you had these days are like birds on a tree.

1980
02:20:08,680 --> 02:20:11,850
A small noise is enough to make them fly away.

1981
02:20:16,760 --> 02:20:18,890
Just a bloody sound.

1982
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:36,220
Mom...

1983
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:38,550
Mom...

1984
02:20:47,350 --> 02:20:51,470
We don’t know if it exists biologically and scientifically,

1985
02:20:51,850 --> 02:20:54,550
but we all imagine it... that is feelings.

1986
02:20:55,180 --> 02:20:59,970
But brain is right within us, it needs logic

1987
02:21:00,390 --> 02:21:02,600
but heart requires feelings.

1988
02:21:02,970 --> 02:21:10,010
If the heart gets what it wants,
you feel good otherwise you don’t.

1989
02:21:10,470 --> 02:21:14,390
If you know how you want to live, infact how you are living...

1990
02:21:14,720 --> 02:21:17,050
you have to ensure there is no gap between them

1991
02:21:17,550 --> 02:21:21,300
infact you have to give up some things you like for it.

1992
02:21:23,430 --> 02:21:27,350
Then you will know how to rise like a phoenix from the ashes.

1993
02:21:27,430 --> 02:21:29,050
Sir I have a question.
-Please...

1994
02:21:29,260 --> 02:21:34,260
Sir, I am married but I am not happy...
so as I have to compromises in my career.

1995
02:21:34,350 --> 02:21:37,220
Infact 22 years back, I too faced the same situation.

1996
02:21:38,680 --> 02:21:39,930
I divorced Padmavathi

1997
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:45,100
and I followed my dream... here I am.

1998
02:21:54,430 --> 02:21:57,100
Is it so easy... to leave people whom you love.

1999
02:21:58,100 --> 02:21:58,800
Well.

2000
02:21:59,970 --> 02:22:01,800
It isn’t as difficult as living together

2001
02:22:02,010 --> 02:22:02,930
I really need it

2002
02:22:03,010 --> 02:22:09,760
Isn’t it cheating to give up after deciding
on embarking on a journey together?

2003
02:22:15,100 --> 02:22:19,100
Words like good, bad, cheating exist in the dictionary.

2004
02:22:19,510 --> 02:22:20,470
Not here.

2005
02:22:21,300 --> 02:22:23,930
If I had stayed with her, she would have suffered more,

2006
02:22:24,720 --> 02:22:26,430
that’s why I freed Padmavathi.

2007
02:22:28,050 --> 02:22:30,140
In fact she must be happy somewhere

2008
02:22:30,260 --> 02:22:31,600
It isn’t enough if you think that way.

2009
02:22:32,640 --> 02:22:38,550
The ones who loved you want to be with you till the end.

2010
02:22:40,600 --> 02:22:43,970
You know why... bacause they are loving you.

2011
02:22:44,550 --> 02:22:46,680
but this is concerned with feelings.

2012
02:22:47,510 --> 02:22:49,930
You won’t understand, because you never had it

2013
02:22:50,850 --> 02:22:52,550
I already told you I don’t have it.

2014
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:55,350
infact nobody has it.

2015
02:22:57,300 --> 02:23:00,470
That's why, I told Padmavathi to forget me.

2016
02:23:04,220 --> 02:23:06,140
if it is necessary
to take pain to live together,

2017
02:23:09,180 --> 02:23:10,220
why take the burden.

2018
02:23:10,260 --> 02:23:11,510
It is not a burden,

2019
02:23:12,140 --> 02:23:13,010
it is a responsibility.

2020
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:15,970
We cannot get far away from people who
we love, only for the sake of difficulties.

2021
02:23:16,720 --> 02:23:20,260
we will share or solve the problem.

2022
02:23:21,890 --> 02:23:25,470
How does one feel when you tell them
on the face that they have forgotten you.

2023
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:30,510
They are dying for not able to find a reason to live.

2024
02:23:35,390 --> 02:23:38,800
You seem to be a victim for a non existing feeling.

2025
02:23:39,600 --> 02:23:40,970
It is easy to forget,

2026
02:23:41,930 --> 02:23:42,970
learn to move on

2027
02:23:43,890 --> 02:23:45,350
and train your brain young man.

2028
02:23:46,100 --> 02:23:47,140
Very simple.

2029
02:23:47,180 --> 02:23:52,640
I didn’t know it was that simple,
but it is difficult to live like this.

2030
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:57,640
You are happy forgetting everything, not us...

2031
02:23:58,850 --> 02:24:00,010
we shall try to get used to it

2032
02:24:25,890 --> 02:24:28,260
Taxi... Taxi...

2033
02:24:31,350 --> 02:24:33,600
Surya... Surya...

2034
02:24:34,300 --> 02:24:35,350
Surya...

2035
02:24:49,450 --> 02:24:50,250
Hello...

2036
02:24:50,450 --> 02:24:53,410
I understood where I went wrong.

2037
02:24:54,250 --> 02:24:58,120
You said there is a register office close by..

2038
02:25:00,370 --> 02:25:01,500
shall we marry?

2039
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:04,040
What?

2040
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:08,750
I am waiting at the register office.. will you come

2041
02:25:12,790 --> 02:25:14,000
Where do you have to go?

2042
02:25:15,290 --> 02:25:16,620
Where do you have to go?

2043
02:25:17,870 --> 02:25:19,040
Registrar office

2044
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:43,870
I troubled you a lot, I am sorry, there is no time.

2045
02:25:44,120 --> 02:25:47,040
Our wedding should happen when I remember everything.

2046
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:51,870
There will be many formalities in a register marriage..
-I managed everything...you don't talk.

2047
02:25:51,910 --> 02:25:53,120
Name...
-Karthik

2048
02:25:54,160 --> 02:25:56,160
Full name
-Surya Ravipati

2049
02:25:56,290 --> 02:25:57,790
Is it Surya or Karthik

2050
02:25:57,830 --> 02:25:59,290
Surya..Ravipati Surya

2051
02:26:01,580 --> 02:26:02,620
Parents

2052
02:26:02,790 --> 02:26:04,540
Ravipati Padmavathi. No father

2053
02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:05,580
Place of birth

2054
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:07,370
Anantapur... Dharmavaram.

2055
02:26:07,700 --> 02:26:09,580
Well...date of birth

2056
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:11,910
9-5...
-06-03-1984.

2057
02:26:12,080 --> 02:26:13,290
Stop joking

2058
02:26:13,620 --> 02:26:15,250
09-05-1986

2059
02:26:15,580 --> 02:26:17,450
There is the Registrar Office, let us go get married

2060
02:26:17,580 --> 02:26:20,450
Come Vaishu..
-Who are you boss, wedding for us?

2061
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:22,370
Whom are you talking to?

2062
02:26:22,620 --> 02:26:27,040
She is not the Vaishali you know, she doesn't know who you are

2063
02:26:27,500 --> 02:26:33,120
If Vaishali has forgotten Surya she
will not recognise me, if I appear before her

2064
02:26:47,660 --> 02:26:50,330
From tomorrow I will be Mrs. Surya.

2065
02:26:51,370 --> 02:26:52,120
Take your hand off,

2066
02:26:54,870 --> 02:26:56,450
Take your hand off, Karthik will notice

2067
02:26:56,830 --> 02:27:00,040
Surya, there is no one here..whom are you talking about?

2068
02:27:00,500 --> 02:27:02,910
Oh you forgot him too?

2069
02:27:04,950 --> 02:27:08,200
Karthik..she doesn't remember you

2070
02:27:09,830 --> 02:27:13,080
There is nobody here, whom are you talking to?

2071
02:27:13,120 --> 02:27:14,580
Can't you see him, he is besides you...

2072
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:17,750
What..?

2073
02:27:22,200 --> 02:27:28,250
He became mad stalking you, that retrograde right.

2074
02:27:29,160 --> 02:27:31,540
Sorry I forgot

2075
02:27:32,200 --> 02:27:34,750
Why are you crying?

2076
02:27:37,950 --> 02:27:41,910
He turned mad by professing love to you afresh every day.

2077
02:27:43,250 --> 02:27:45,160
He should cry...
Why are you crying...?

2078
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:51,790
Don't cry, it irritates me.

2079
02:27:56,000 --> 02:27:56,660
Okay.

2080
02:27:58,200 --> 02:28:05,870
I loved you so much that Surya had to die
and Karthik had to be born,

2081
02:28:07,660 --> 02:28:10,330
you had hurt so much..what wrong did I do?

2082
02:28:11,870 --> 02:28:13,160
Inferiority...

2083
02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:17,500
Because I loved you more than I love myself,

2084
02:28:18,080 --> 02:28:20,750
I believed you when you said you had amnesia.

2085
02:28:20,910 --> 02:28:21,790
No...

2086
02:28:25,330 --> 02:28:26,540
I deserve all this..

2087
02:28:27,040 --> 02:28:28,290
you have done something very wrong Vaishu

2088
02:28:28,370 --> 02:28:29,410
Surya....

2089
02:28:55,160 --> 02:28:56,200
Surya...

2090
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:01,160
Surya...

2091
02:29:02,790 --> 02:29:09,000
Though I am outwardly angry, I am thrilled
inside as I now know you have no Retrograde.

2092
02:29:09,580 --> 02:29:10,370
Vaishu...

2093
02:29:10,580 --> 02:29:11,540
Vaishu...

2094
02:29:18,660 --> 02:29:20,580
Let us start your med school

2095
02:29:20,950 --> 02:29:24,040
What a stupid question...
Ravindranath Tagore Medical College

2096
02:29:24,120 --> 02:29:26,290
Plus two
-Avila convent

2097
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:27,750
Then High school?

2098
02:29:31,620 --> 02:29:32,660
Try Vaishu.

2099
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:37,330
She forgot even her school name.

2100
02:29:40,540 --> 02:29:42,540
Try to remember..please try.

2101
02:29:43,620 --> 02:29:44,450
I don't remember

2102
02:29:49,700 --> 02:29:51,540
In alphabetical order..O..for

2103
02:29:51,580 --> 02:29:55,000
O for orange P for phone, S for stethoscope,
T for thermometer.

2104
02:29:56,950 --> 02:29:59,200
Can you repeat O for

2105
02:30:04,250 --> 02:30:05,290
Vaishu..O for..

2106
02:30:06,750 --> 02:30:07,790
O for Orange

2107
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:09,750
S for..

2108
02:30:12,040 --> 02:30:12,830
P for..

2109
02:30:13,160 --> 02:30:14,450
Vaishu...P for..

2110
02:30:18,790 --> 02:30:19,830
Phone Vaishu

2111
02:30:24,120 --> 02:30:28,830
I told you not to call, don't you understand
I don't like you at all.

2112
02:30:29,160 --> 02:30:31,500
Why do you irritate me, leave me.

2113
02:30:37,870 --> 02:30:39,000
Poor Surya,

2114
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:49,370
Isn't it a better option to die, than live like this.

2115
02:30:54,330 --> 02:30:58,370
When she realised her memory is fading gradually,
she got worried about you Surya.

2116
02:30:59,450 --> 02:31:03,540
She thought she will forget you, that thought killed her.

2117
02:31:04,700 --> 02:31:11,290
She made me lie to all that she has
no problem but to you she told the truth.

2118
02:31:12,200 --> 02:31:16,120
She told you that she had forgotten you.
That was lie for that moment.

2119
02:31:17,330 --> 02:31:18,750
but that is the fact.

2120
02:31:19,330 --> 02:31:21,040
Will you leave her as an orphan...

2121
02:31:21,080 --> 02:31:21,870
Surya...

2122
02:31:23,120 --> 02:31:26,580
or will you start loving her again..it is your choice.

2123
02:31:37,700 --> 02:31:43,750
I will sign only if you tell me your husband's name.
You wait..you tell me.

2124
02:31:44,160 --> 02:31:47,200
Let her say...listen to me...
she has to...

2125
02:31:47,660 --> 02:31:48,700
Surya...

2126
02:31:49,120 --> 02:31:50,540
That's it

2127
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:53,700
here are the garlands

2128
02:31:53,830 --> 02:31:55,120
Take this.

2129
02:31:56,200 --> 02:31:58,250
Hey... firstly you...

2130
02:32:03,080 --> 02:32:05,580
When is the first night?
-As your wish.

2131
02:32:06,620 --> 02:32:08,580
We don't have to run again.
