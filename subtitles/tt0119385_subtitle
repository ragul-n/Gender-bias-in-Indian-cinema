The inspector's dress that we..

18
00:01:40,423 --> 00:01:43,551
..stitched for Mr. Venkatesh
will suit him well, right?

19

lt will suit him.

20
00:01:47,196 --> 00:01:48,823
They will give you ten rupees.

You don't know? Why didn't

Mother.

Get lost. Get lost from here.

38

00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:11,443
Please come, they
are waiting for you.

50
00:03:11,547 --> 00:03:12,844
He came from a drama company..

51
00:03:12,949 --> 00:03:14,507
..and played some
minor roles in movies.

52
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:16,244
His mother works as a
maid in a number of houses..

53
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,252
..to support him. lf
you recommend his name..

54
00:03:18,354 --> 00:03:19,616
Hey, close that door.

55
00:04:29,892 --> 00:04:32,360
lt's not a hockey stick,
it's a sword, you know that?

56
00:04:32,462 --> 00:04:33,656
You know what is this?
- l know.

57
00:04:33,996 --> 00:04:35,486
l know how to hold a sword.

58
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:39,329
l learnt it from great masters.
Since ten years l have been..

59
00:04:39,435 --> 00:04:41,995
Hero's chance..
- Mr. Narshimham.

60
00:04:42,572 --> 00:04:44,062
You lost the chance to be a hero.

61
00:04:45,975 --> 00:04:48,876
He has courage in the heart.
He has that aggression.

62
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:50,571
He's our picture's hero.

63
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:19,429
ln a country where one has
to beg for a child's milk..

64
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:22,163
..when will people stop
wasting milk for the stones?

65
00:06:30,813 --> 00:06:33,441
l wonder when the people
who worship the cow-dung..

66
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:35,676
..will change and identify the poor.

67
00:06:36,485 --> 00:06:37,952
You are writer
Samara Suryam, aren't you?

68
00:06:39,622 --> 00:06:41,681
When will there be a
revolution in the country?

69
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,725
lsn't it our responsibility
to bring that revolution?

70
00:06:43,826 --> 00:06:46,454
l like the language
you use very much..

71
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:48,962
..but l can't agree
with your viewpoint.

72
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:50,965
l guessed it the moment l saw you.

73
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:55,899
White silk. lt's the native
white man's greed to rule.

74
00:06:56,572 --> 00:06:59,871
Beads. Our people know
nothing about science.

75
00:07:00,843 --> 00:07:02,470
lf you ask them what's
Yama's transportation..

76
00:07:02,578 --> 00:07:03,977
..they will say a male buffalo.

77
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,878
A garland for cattle and
the same garland for human.

78
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:08,741
That is also bearable.

79
00:07:09,518 --> 00:07:12,214
But ash on forehead?
- You call Vibhudi mere ash?

80
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,512
And God?
- He doesn't exist.

81
00:07:14,624 --> 00:07:16,489
And he whom we see in the temple?
- lt's a stone.

82
00:07:17,093 --> 00:07:18,617
The Vedas?
- They fool you.

83
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:20,689
The theory of Shastra?
- Superstition.

84
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:22,656
Tying nuptial thread in the wedding?

85
00:07:22,765 --> 00:07:25,029
ls turning a woman into a slave.
- And the band in wedding?

86
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:26,158
lt's something a
worthless person does.

87
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:27,497
And what do you
think about the dot..

88
00:07:27,603 --> 00:07:28,695
..that woman put on their
foreheads? - lt's foolishness.

89
00:07:28,804 --> 00:07:30,499
Great. Great. Great.

90
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,172
You are applauding my
language or my viewpoint?

91
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:35,039
None of them. lt's
for my good fortune.

92
00:07:35,544 --> 00:07:37,512
Your language and my acting!
What would be the result, ..

93
00:07:37,613 --> 00:07:39,513
..if the sharpness of your
words and the sharpness..

94
00:07:39,615 --> 00:07:41,515
..of my sword unite?
lf you could write..

95
00:07:41,617 --> 00:07:43,517
..such beautiful dialogues
for movies. lf that happens..

96
00:07:43,619 --> 00:07:45,519
..the audience will be
deceived by the words..

97
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,054
..and they would
accept me as a lead actor.

98
00:07:48,557 --> 00:07:51,526
Do l look like a deceiver?
- Which other writer..

99
00:07:51,627 --> 00:07:53,527
.. has the power to
mesmerize people..

100
00:07:53,629 --> 00:07:55,722
..with such beautiful
interweaving of words.

101
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:00,528
ls this lead actor in
movies a dear friend of mine..

102
00:08:00,636 --> 00:08:04,538
..or a respected enemy?

103
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,006
For the time being l
am just an admirer.

104
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:11,546
He who gave you a lotus-like face..

105
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:14,548
..who gave you a rose-like body..

106
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,550
..who gave you jasmine-like teeth..

107
00:08:16,652 --> 00:08:19,553
..who gave you marigold-like ears..

108
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:22,556
He who made your body
with different flowers..

109
00:08:22,658 --> 00:08:26,219
..made your heart with a stone?
- Cut.

110
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:29,564
Ok. Take 3.
- l wanted the moonlight..

111
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:33,567
..but l got Amavashya(the
night of lunar eclipse).

112
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:36,570
l wanted freedom, but
you made me a prisoner.

113
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:40,574
l wanted melody, but
you gave me silence.

114
00:08:40,676 --> 00:08:44,874
l wanted the nectar of love,
but you gave me a pot of tears.

115
00:08:45,348 --> 00:08:47,578
l wanted a wax like heart in you..

116
00:08:47,683 --> 00:08:50,709
..but you gave me thorns in return.
- Cut.

117
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:54,581
l waited till the moonlight leaves..

118
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,988
..and left when you were asleep..

119
00:08:59,061 --> 00:09:01,188
But when l was back
to give you my heart..

120
00:09:01,297 --> 00:09:03,094
..you left me all alone.

121
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,601
l kept the gates
of my chamber open..

122
00:09:06,702 --> 00:09:09,262
..but the gentle
breeze remained outside.

123
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:12,600
l kept both my arms open..

124
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:15,268
..but you closed the
gates of your heart.

125
00:09:16,746 --> 00:09:21,615
Like the salt thrown
out by the waves..

126
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:24,982
..you discarded my love.
- Cut.

127
00:09:25,087 --> 00:09:26,611
That was great.
- Excellent.

128
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,356
That was wonderful.
- Great, Anand!

129
00:09:30,893 --> 00:09:33,157
You did it really well.
There's no stopping you now.

130
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:38,991
Anand, my boy, you
have a great future.

131
00:09:39,101 --> 00:09:40,363
Mark my words.

132
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,365
Come on. Come on. Move it.
- How was it?

133
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:46,638
The brightest star
of the movie-world.

134
00:09:46,742 --> 00:09:48,767
lt's because of your words.
lt's because of you.

135
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:51,710
l say democracy. l say freedom.

136
00:09:51,814 --> 00:09:53,975
l say we shall fight for
the freedom of this country.

137
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,377
Who wants freedom? Who wants it?

138
00:09:56,852 --> 00:09:58,251
ln the nation where we are born..

139
00:09:58,354 --> 00:09:59,651
..we are being treated as
untouchables, as outcasts..

140
00:09:59,755 --> 00:10:01,655
..and as the slaves to
the rich and mighty..

141
00:10:01,757 --> 00:10:03,657
..and in spite of having
intellects and scholars..

142
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,886
..when will our
suppressed society get freedom?

143
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:08,720
When will we get it?

144
00:10:11,734 --> 00:10:14,328
Who should rule this country?
Who should rule it?

145
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,896
lt's you. Our countrymen,
but not the white man.

146
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,678
We have to put an
end to the atrocities..

147
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:28,909
..meted out on us in our own
country. We have to stop it.

148
00:10:32,888 --> 00:10:34,685
The people of this country
who are in deep slumber..

149
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,281
..must wake up and get
ready for the battle.

150
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,701
lf the principles, of
other parties are wrong..

151
00:10:49,805 --> 00:10:52,239
..what would you have done
if you were in their place?

152
00:10:54,777 --> 00:10:56,711
lf the reigns of this country
were given into your hands..

153
00:10:56,812 --> 00:10:58,712
..and if you were made
the king, the minister..

154
00:10:58,814 --> 00:10:59,974
..if you were given all
the powers of this country..

155
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:01,106
..then what would you have done?

156
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:04,079
We haven't launched our party yet.

157
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:07,378
Ask that question after we
launch it. Wait till then.

158
00:11:08,424 --> 00:11:09,721
lf you are really given
the reigns in your hand..

159
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:12,225
..and asked to rule
what would you do then?

160
00:11:15,364 --> 00:11:17,229
l will change everything.
- What?

161
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,766
First of all we have to fix a
certain criteria to enter politics.

162
00:11:23,038 --> 00:11:24,335
The rich shouldn't
enter the politics.

163
00:11:25,241 --> 00:11:26,401
The prosperity that the
white men and the rich..

164
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:27,976
..brought for the
poor is not needed.

165
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,278
All the problems will be
solved if the rich are thrown out?

166
00:11:31,514 --> 00:11:32,742
Caste.

167
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:34,746
We have been treated like slaves..

168
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,750
..in the name of being untouchables.

169
00:11:36,852 --> 00:11:38,080
We must enter the cabinet.

170
00:11:38,988 --> 00:11:40,182
Landlords shouldn't be there.

171
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:43,753
Every individual must be free.

172
00:11:43,859 --> 00:11:46,384
There shouldn't be any slavery.

173
00:11:47,997 --> 00:11:50,363
The practice of ministers
treating the policemen..

174
00:11:50,466 --> 00:11:52,161
..as their pawns
should be eradicated.

175
00:11:52,968 --> 00:11:55,266
Corruption must be
completely wiped out.

176
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:59,770
Power. Authority.
Position. lt's a responsibility..

177
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,343
..but not a weapon.

178
00:12:03,546 --> 00:12:04,774
There should be no poverty.

179
00:12:05,814 --> 00:12:06,974
lt must be eliminated forever.

180
00:12:07,349 --> 00:12:08,839
No one should die of hunger.

181
00:12:10,286 --> 00:12:12,982
Everyone should live happily.
Everyone should live happily.

182
00:12:13,822 --> 00:12:15,153
We will establish a new society.

183
00:12:15,257 --> 00:12:16,781
We must protect dharma.

184
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:20,795
l am proud of my friend.

185
00:12:22,064 --> 00:12:23,531
These dreams
shouldn't remain just dreams.

186
00:12:23,832 --> 00:12:25,800
They must come true.
Till they are realized..

187
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:27,892
..we can't sleep in peace. l'll
be there. l'll be there with you.

188
00:12:43,485 --> 00:12:44,509
Suryam.

189
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,300
What happened? What happened?

190
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:03,969
Politics.
- Rascals!

191
00:13:24,026 --> 00:13:25,152
Suryam, sir's here.

192
00:13:26,495 --> 00:13:27,894
Don't get up. Don't
get up. Don't get up.

193
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,159
You are the real power right now.

194
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:34,330
To be a superpower,
return healthy and hale.

195
00:13:35,137 --> 00:13:36,161
This is just the beginning.

196
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:37,869
There are many more
hurdles, hardships..

197
00:13:37,973 --> 00:13:40,533
..and obstacles waiting
for us. What do you say?

198
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:42,876
To fight them all you
must gather the courage..

199
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:45,538
..and develop mental and
physical strength, Suryam.

200
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,876
A person like you is of
utmost importance now.

201
00:13:48,417 --> 00:13:49,884
To achieve our goals,
to realize our dreams..

202
00:13:49,985 --> 00:13:51,885
..to shed the blood
and to make sacrifices..

203
00:13:51,987 --> 00:13:53,545
..a person like you is needed now.

204
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:55,889
Suryam, get well and come to us.

205
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:03,430
What's this! A person is
lying in a critical condition..

206
00:14:03,532 --> 00:14:05,898
..and instead of asking
him about his condition..

207
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:08,299
..he is asking you to get up
and get your other leg broken.

208
00:14:09,238 --> 00:14:15,643
l have to go to see the match.
l wonder what they will say.

209
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:18,644
With this face, you want to marry?

210
00:14:19,515 --> 00:14:21,073
Let me see.
- O mother!

211
00:14:43,172 --> 00:14:46,073
Anand. Anand, look here.

212
00:14:46,508 --> 00:14:49,671
Tell me the truth
about why we came here.

213
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:51,275
How many times do l
have to tell you..

214
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,677
..that l got a telegram,
that mother is not well?

215
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:55,310
So you got a telegram in that form?

216
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:58,077
But l got it in this form.

217
00:14:59,521 --> 00:15:02,615
This is sister Annamma
writing to brother Kashi.

218
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,558
On the next Wednesday morning..

219
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:05,957
..Anand and Pushpalu's..

220
00:15:06,061 --> 00:15:07,961
..wedding is fixed.

221
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:09,963
You must come here along
with your family and give..

222
00:15:10,065 --> 00:15:12,556
..the couple your blessings.
Your sister, Annamma.

223
00:15:16,238 --> 00:15:18,365
l am going back. l am
going back by the next train.

224
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:20,169
l'll break your legs.
- What's going on!

225
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:21,367
Everyone's making a fool out of me.

226
00:15:22,544 --> 00:15:26,241
Look, it's my responsibility
to hand you over to your mother.

227
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:28,306
lt's my responsibility.

228
00:15:29,118 --> 00:15:30,142
l can't come.

229
00:15:30,252 --> 00:15:32,277
Leave my shirt. l'll forget
that you are elder than me.

230
00:15:33,188 --> 00:15:35,088
Leave my shirt. Give and take
respect. - Hold that as well.

231
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:37,124
Leave my shirt. Do
you think l am kid?

232
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:43,395
Annamma, your son's
here. Get up. Get up.

233
00:15:48,437 --> 00:15:51,702
As l told you.. Lord! O lord!

234
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,776
l am not marrying anyone. l
am leaving by the next train.

235
00:15:54,877 --> 00:15:55,935
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

236
00:15:56,612 --> 00:15:58,512
You are making garlands here?

237
00:15:58,614 --> 00:16:01,879
No one is getting
married here. Get up. Get up.

238
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:04,844
Don't get up. Don't get up.
- You think l don't have a voice?

239
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:06,352
You think just because l
listen to everything you say..

240
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:07,479
..l am not a man?

241
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:08,954
Who gave approval to this marriage?

242
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:12,360
First of all take a bath
and then go and see the girl.

243
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:14,019
lf you don't like her you
can leave by the next train.

244
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:16,654
Did you take dowry?
You sold me for dowry?

245
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:19,359
l won't force you to
marry someone you don't like.

246
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:21,629
lf you don't like her, l
will really not force you.

247
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:22,761
Then what's the rush for?

248
00:16:22,871 --> 00:16:25,362
Why did you fool me and
called me here in this way?

249
00:16:25,474 --> 00:16:27,374
Just because your son
hasn't started earning yet..

250
00:16:27,476 --> 00:16:29,376
..it won't matter if
that girl has crooked eyes..

251
00:16:29,478 --> 00:16:30,604
..crooked nose, or crooked feet?

252
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:38,847
l am asking you for the last
time what do you want to say?

253
00:16:41,657 --> 00:16:43,921
l am asking you.
What do you want to say?

254
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:48,789
l accepted this
match without asking you.

255
00:16:49,531 --> 00:16:53,058
lt's my fault. l didn't ask
them to stop the wedding..

256
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:54,999
l assured them that
my son would come..

257
00:16:55,103 --> 00:16:56,627
..and that he won't
go against my wish.

258
00:16:57,473 --> 00:17:00,408
lf you say no now l will
have to go back to them..

259
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:02,670
..and l will have to ask
them to stop everything.

260
00:17:03,545 --> 00:17:05,479
Tell me what you say now.

261
00:17:12,654 --> 00:17:14,645
l haven't even shaved yet.
- l will do it.

262
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,486
ln order to get my
approval you will have to..

263
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:19,151
That means he has agreed.

264
00:17:20,128 --> 00:17:22,494
Only if you agree to what l say..
- Tell me what it is.

265
00:17:22,598 --> 00:17:23,758
Let me talk for a moment.

266
00:17:48,991 --> 00:17:51,459
Mr. Sundarayya and Mrs.
Parvatamma's son..

267
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,460
..Samara Suryam is
getting married to..

268
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:56,463
..Mr. Chandrayya and Mrs.
lndiramma's daughter..

269
00:17:56,565 --> 00:18:00,194
..Manikyam. l now

270
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,470

Mrs. lndiramma's daughter..

272
00:18:13,582 --> 00:18:16,915

273
00:18:19,521 --> 00:18:25,482

lndira's daughter..

274
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:31,499
..accept Mr. Sundarayya

275
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,230
..him as my husband.

00:18:49,885 --> 00:18:51,785
The newlywed couple..
- ..may have joy and prosperity.

277
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,515
The newlywed couple..

278
00:18:54,656 --> 00:18:55,680
Pushpa.

279
00:18:58,794 --> 00:18:59,818
l want to talk to you.

280
00:19:01,296 --> 00:19:02,957
How do l talk to you
if you turn that way?

281
00:19:03,665 --> 00:19:04,689
l am listening to you.

282
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,694
l am listening to you.

283
00:19:12,574 --> 00:19:14,041
You know how this
wedding took place?

284
00:19:15,077 --> 00:19:18,274
Tell me.
- Against your wish.

285
00:19:19,314 --> 00:19:22,647
And you? lt was
against your wish as well?

286
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:24,843
Tell me.

287
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:26,878
l will tell you tomorrow.

288
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:32,885
What if l leave you and go away?
- You won't leave.

289
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:36,055
Why?
- l will tell you.

290
00:19:36,698 --> 00:19:37,722
Tell me.

291
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:42,227
You fell in love with me.

292
00:19:42,337 --> 00:19:45,898
l fell in love with this face?

293
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:51,605
Yes, l fell in love, but
don't tell this to anyone.

294
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:55,214
l told everyone about it.
- O my God!

295
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:58,251
l am not an infant who drinks milk.

296
00:19:59,287 --> 00:20:01,187
l am your husband who
wants to share your dreams..

297
00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:02,847
..and your innermost thoughts.

298
00:20:04,126 --> 00:20:06,185
Leave your innocence
behind and come to me..

299
00:20:06,294 --> 00:20:07,955
..without any inhibitions.

300
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,666
What's that drama? - Mother
asked me to touch your feet.

301
00:20:15,771 --> 00:20:16,795
Didn't your mother tell
you that men and women..

302
00:20:16,905 --> 00:20:17,929
..both are equal?

303
00:20:19,207 --> 00:20:21,607
lf you touch my feet l will also
have to touch your feet, right?

304
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,702
You shouldn't say that.
- What else should l say?

305
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:31,277
Shall l tell you a poem?
Shall l tell you about love?

306
00:20:33,155 --> 00:20:34,247
Shall l teach you lullabies?

307
00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:41,023
lt's your wish. - No, dear.
Your wishes are important.

308
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:44,089
Your desires are important.
Your sensuality is important.

309
00:20:44,199 --> 00:20:48,727
Tell me what your wishes are.
- O God! l don't know.

310
00:20:48,837 --> 00:20:50,828
Why do you invite
God to the bedroom?

311
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:51,963
Oh no!

312
00:20:52,074 --> 00:20:53,769
Manikyam. Be careful.

313
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:11,388
lt's not an auspicious day.
- Why isn't it auspicious?

314
00:21:11,993 --> 00:21:14,962
lt's the first night
and my sari got burnt..

315
00:21:17,165 --> 00:21:18,393
What's the need for
these separations, dear?

316
00:21:19,901 --> 00:21:22,267
lt's not fire that burnt
the sari on your body..

317
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,701
..but it's the fire of separation.

318
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:28,199
Yes, the fire of
separation that can burn down..

319
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:29,868
..your husband, my beloved one.

320
00:21:35,717 --> 00:21:38,686
Not just beauty, but it
seems that you have got..

321
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:40,982
..a bit of intelligence as well?
- Yes, l have.

322
00:21:42,457 --> 00:21:43,685
What are you wishes?

323
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:47,787
He must be a good person.
- Am l not a good person?

324
00:21:48,764 --> 00:21:50,698
No matter how good a person he is..

325
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,733
..he should never change.
- And what if l change?

326
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:55,726
l'll push you.
- How?

327
00:21:55,937 --> 00:22:00,636
, ,

328
00:22:01,877 --> 00:22:02,901
ln this way.

329
00:22:03,178 --> 00:22:16,148
, ,

330
00:22:16,358 --> 00:22:18,292
They are a newlywed
couple. That's why..

331
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:26,390
''O face of the moon,
O face of the moon..''

332
00:22:26,501 --> 00:22:29,265
''..are you the blue sky of melody?''

333
00:22:29,371 --> 00:22:31,737
''Come to me in the
form of the moonlight..''

334
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,365
''..and express your heart.''

335
00:22:34,776 --> 00:22:37,745
''Under the auspicious moonlight..''

336
00:22:37,846 --> 00:22:40,747
''..when the flowers are smiling..''

337
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:44,842
''..l am fortune to see
your graceful gait.''

338
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,754
''Under the auspicious moonlight..''

My sari.

350
00:23:41,509 --> 00:23:43,033
Mother-in-law. Leave me.

''ls it a dream or is it for real?''

356
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:40,861
''My life is filled with melody.''

''The moonlight comes to you.''

379
00:26:55,036 --> 00:26:57,004
Mr. Narsingh.
- Greetings, sir.

380
00:26:57,205 --> 00:26:58,229
Please change your hand.

381
00:26:58,339 --> 00:27:01,001
Please think about it for everyone.
- l can't. l can't.

382
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:02,667
What happened?
- Go and see there. You'll know it.

383
00:27:06,581 --> 00:27:09,015
What happened, brother?
- They bought rail-tickets..

384
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:11,677
..for everyone. The
accountant is waiting for you. Go.

385
00:27:14,656 --> 00:27:17,022
What happened?
- Sign the form..

386
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:19,320
..and take the salary
and rail ticket with you.

387
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:22,154
The movie has been stalled.

388
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:25,462
There is no other way.

389
00:27:26,334 --> 00:27:27,358
Only God can help us.

390
00:27:29,804 --> 00:27:31,271
Settle everything there.

391
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,540
Director sir, everyone is saying
that the movie has been stalled.

392
00:27:37,812 --> 00:27:39,780
ls it true? Whose mistake is it?

393
00:27:40,748 --> 00:27:44,115
ls it mine? ls it because l
didn't act well? - No, no, young man.

394
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:47,048
They have got some
financial problems.

395
00:27:47,322 --> 00:27:49,290
After they are cleared..
- Please don't say that, sir.

396
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:51,784
This is the first film l
am working as a lead actor.

397
00:27:52,594 --> 00:27:55,154
lf it is stalled in this way,
my career will be ruined, sir.

398
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,058
More than half of the movie is shot.

399
00:27:57,165 --> 00:27:58,223
And if it stops now..

400
00:27:59,534 --> 00:28:01,593
Let's do one thing, sir.
l don't want any salary.

401
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,534
l will give you back
the money l got till now.

402
00:28:04,105 --> 00:28:05,265
l will convince everyone, sir.

403
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:07,466
Don't pay anyone till
the movie is completed.

404
00:28:07,575 --> 00:28:09,065
Let's start it again somehow, sir.

405
00:28:09,177 --> 00:28:11,145
Sir, tell me if l need
to do something else.

406
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:14,112
l tried my best to
convince the producer.

407
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:18,677
He said he can't shoot
the movie now. l'm sorry.

408
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:26,725
Anand, you are a saint.
Don't give up.

409
00:28:27,262 --> 00:28:29,389
l'm sure you have a great future.

410
00:28:31,633 --> 00:28:34,602
What can you do if
this was in my destiny!

411
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:36,462
lt's my fate.

412
00:28:37,138 --> 00:28:38,833
Velu, start the car.
Sir has to leave.

413
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:47,105
No matter whatever has happened..

414
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,773
..l will never forget you, sir.

415
00:28:48,883 --> 00:28:50,111
Goodbye.

416
00:28:55,423 --> 00:28:58,119
Under Mr. Jai
Prakasham's leadership..

417
00:28:58,226 --> 00:29:00,592
..with noble intentions..

418
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:03,129
..to serve the
people of this state..

419
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:06,860
..we are launching this party.

420
00:29:07,235 --> 00:29:09,135
This party's only ambition,
is to give..

421
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:13,196
..selfless service to
the people of this state.

422
00:29:22,850 --> 00:29:23,874
Suryam.

423
00:29:27,488 --> 00:29:28,512
Suryam.

424
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:31,154
Where is the
earnestness in the walk..

425
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:32,658
..and the fire in the eyes?

426
00:29:34,262 --> 00:29:35,627
Our movie has been stalled.

427
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,158
The movie in which l
was the lead actor..

428
00:29:37,265 --> 00:29:39,665
..and that you wrote
dialogues for has been stalled.

429
00:29:39,934 --> 00:29:41,231
Everyone packed the bags and left.

430
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:42,892
Pictures come and go.

431
00:29:43,538 --> 00:29:45,733
Money comes and goes. Wipe it out.

432
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,331
lt wiped away your
future and my future.

433
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:52,379
Anand, a new chapter in
history has dawned here.

434
00:29:52,847 --> 00:29:54,872
A new society. A new mission.

435
00:29:55,216 --> 00:29:57,480
A new path. A new destination.

436
00:29:57,585 --> 00:29:58,916
Progress. Development.

437
00:30:00,321 --> 00:30:02,812
l am talking life and
you are talking politics?

438
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:05,452
What's more important for
you, politics or movies?

439
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,788
lt's easy for you to say that.

440
00:30:06,894 --> 00:30:08,191
Your father is a Telugu master,
he has a government job..

441
00:30:08,296 --> 00:30:09,627
..he taught you Telugu.

442
00:30:09,964 --> 00:30:11,192
You didn't know what
pain is as you got..

443
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:12,323
..your four meals each day at home.

444
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:13,866
After eating a stomach
full you are talking politics.

445
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:16,726
Did you starve for 4-5
days when you were a kid?

446
00:30:17,338 --> 00:30:18,430
Did you act in a drama company..

447
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,200
..because you couldn't
afford to go to the school?

448
00:30:20,308 --> 00:30:22,208
Did you see the creditors
slap your father with sandals..

449
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,335
..because he
couldn't clear the debts?

450
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,946
You melted my heart, my friend.
- Get lost.

451
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,810
Shall l tell you the truth?
lf you enter politics..

452
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,648
..you would easily devour me.

453
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,688
l am thinking of quitting
everything and joining the military.

454
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:39,225
We have just got a handful of land..

455
00:30:39,327 --> 00:30:41,625
..the whole world is there
yet to be conquered, friend.

456
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:45,230
What do you want? Telugu
film industry in one hand..

457
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:48,598
..the state politics in
the other. What do you want?

458
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:49,727
l'm going to..

459
00:30:52,273 --> 00:30:54,901
Where is the earnestness in the
walk and the fire in the eyes?

460
00:30:55,576 --> 00:30:56,873
Where is the weapon to fight?

461
00:30:57,445 --> 00:30:58,639
Where is that iron determination?

462
00:30:59,414 --> 00:31:01,245
Where is your courage
that won't let you show..

463
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:03,249
..your back to the enemy when
you face him in the battlefield?

464
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:04,375
Where is it?

465
00:31:04,652 --> 00:31:06,984
Will you smile at least when
l come back from the village?

466
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:09,652
l can't solve your problems.

467
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:11,920
l am not a goddess.

468
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:15,061
You can bid me goodbye at
least with a smile, can't you?

469
00:31:17,131 --> 00:31:18,155
Go inside, dear.

470
00:31:20,101 --> 00:31:24,162
Why are you leaving me now? Why?

471
00:31:24,272 --> 00:31:26,570
You are the one who is
sending me away? - Why?

472
00:31:27,342 --> 00:31:28,673
You shouldn't cry now.

473
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:31,067
You will hide it from me as well?

474
00:31:31,713 --> 00:31:33,681
What's this?
- lt's.. lt's nothing.

475
00:31:33,981 --> 00:31:35,107
Why did you apply to military?

476
00:31:35,216 --> 00:31:37,446
So that you could go
away from all of us, right?

477
00:31:37,552 --> 00:31:39,679
Just because you will
have to feed me, right?

478
00:31:41,356 --> 00:31:43,950
l can fill my stomach. You
can't give up your dreams..

479
00:31:44,058 --> 00:31:47,425
..for my sake.
- l won't go anywhere.

480
00:31:47,528 --> 00:31:50,258
l'm here. l'm just here.

481
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,124
Pushpa.

482
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:55,966
You will have to bring me back.

483
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,162
l won't come back on my own.

484
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:08,979
lt's difficult for someone
to play such a role small..

485
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,051
..who already acted as a hero.
- Mind your own business.

486
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:13,713
l have seen many
actors coming and fading.

487
00:32:14,188 --> 00:32:17,646
The director is coming.
- Did you memorize the dialogue?

488
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,117
Say it once.
- Say it.

489
00:32:21,763 --> 00:32:22,991
ls he that capable person?

490
00:32:23,097 --> 00:32:25,725
He destroyed my family.
He killed my father.

491
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:27,599
He says he gave him credit,
he created a scene..

492
00:32:27,702 --> 00:32:28,999
..and then he insulted him
in public for not returning..

493
00:32:29,103 --> 00:32:31,435
..the money, and he committed
suicide by hanging himself..

494
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:33,131
..from the tree to save
himself from disgrace.

495
00:32:33,241 --> 00:32:36,005
Scoundrel, an old man's
body was hanging from a tree..

496
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,010
..but your box was filled with..

497
00:32:38,112 --> 00:32:40,239
But your box was filled with..

498
00:32:41,349 --> 00:32:44,113
You sinner.. - Ashok, you
know the dialogue, right?

499
00:32:44,218 --> 00:32:46,015
Tell him.
- ls he that capable person?

500
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,611
He destroyed my family.
He killed my father.

501
00:32:48,723 --> 00:32:51,590
Mr. Surya Rao, come here.
Give him this dress.

502
00:32:51,692 --> 00:32:54,160
You do not worry. Come,
there are many other characters.

503
00:32:54,262 --> 00:32:57,026
Come. - ..by hanging
himself from the tree.

504
00:32:57,131 --> 00:32:59,361
Scoundrel.. - Give him the
younger landlord's dress.

505
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,627
You asked me to give
it to Venkata Subbayya.

506
00:33:00,735 --> 00:33:02,225
Ok, give him at least
this constable's dress.

507
00:33:02,336 --> 00:33:04,236
Get him ready before the
director screams at us.

508
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,069
Do not get angry, Anand.

509
00:33:07,175 --> 00:33:09,143
Role is important. lt's not
important which role it is.

510
00:33:09,243 --> 00:33:11,040
How many times do l have
to play a policeman's role?

511
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,444
Now they'll call me only
when they would need a police.

512
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:14,572
No, l'll go home.

513
00:33:18,085 --> 00:33:20,053
Don't show your face.
Cover your face with a beard..

514
00:33:20,154 --> 00:33:22,054
..and a moustache. They will
think it was someone else.

515
00:33:22,156 --> 00:33:24,056
Don't leave a role
that comes your way.

516
00:33:50,117 --> 00:33:53,416
56/Take-1 .
- ls he that capable person?

517
00:33:53,521 --> 00:33:56,581
He destroyed my family.
He killed my father.

518
00:33:56,691 --> 00:33:58,090
He says he gave him credit,
he created a scene..

519
00:33:58,192 --> 00:34:00,092
..and then he insulted him
in public for not returning..

520
00:34:00,194 --> 00:34:03,095
..the money, and he committed
suicide by hanging himself..

521
00:34:03,197 --> 00:34:05,563
..from the tree to save
himself from disgrace. - Cut!

522
00:34:05,666 --> 00:34:07,133
Ok for film?
- Ok.

523
00:34:07,235 --> 00:34:08,634
Ok for sound?
- Ok, sir.

524
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:11,570
Shut the camera's face.

525
00:34:11,672 --> 00:34:13,640
Reddy, bring that paper..

526
00:34:18,145 --> 00:34:22,844
Mother, so you came to see
your son playing miniscule parts?

527
00:34:27,588 --> 00:34:29,385
God is merciless, son.

528
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,300
Hail lndependent lndia!
- Hail lndependent lndia!

529
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:54,245
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!

530
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:57,408
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!

531
00:35:05,192 --> 00:35:07,490
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!
Hail Mahatma Gandhi!

532
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:11,258
We are sorry, son.
Pushpa left us all.

533
00:35:12,466 --> 00:35:15,333
lt was a minor fever, but
fate was too harsh on us.

534
00:35:20,641 --> 00:35:22,666
l am performing my
daughter's last rituals.

535
00:35:23,811 --> 00:35:27,178
Her mother and l are just
waiting for our end now.

536
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,184
She should've lived for 100 years..

537
00:35:31,285 --> 00:35:34,550
..but she left us all in
the middle of the journey.

538
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:44,755
l want to see her face.

539
00:35:48,402 --> 00:35:49,835
l want to see Pushpa's face.

540
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,396
You didn't even let me
see her for the last time.

541
00:35:53,507 --> 00:35:57,944
Take her out. l need to
see Pushpa's face. - Anand.

542
00:35:58,346 --> 00:36:00,610
You didn't even let me see
her face for the last time.

543
00:36:00,715 --> 00:36:02,706
Come. - l want to see
her for the last time.

544
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:06,878
l want to see Pushpa's face.
l want to see Pushpa's face.

545
00:36:08,923 --> 00:36:12,518
You didn't even let me see
her for the last time. Pushpa.

546
00:36:22,937 --> 00:36:24,962
Come fast. lt's
Chandra moon town company.

547
00:36:25,272 --> 00:36:26,296
Mr. Prabhakar is the director.
- But l met him before.

548
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:28,238
l don't know all that. He
just asked me to bring you.

549
00:36:28,342 --> 00:36:30,810
For which role?
- What's the matter with you?

550
00:36:30,911 --> 00:36:32,708
lt's the lead role.
- Me?

551
00:36:33,481 --> 00:36:35,711
O lord! - Yes. The
director wants to see you.

552
00:36:35,816 --> 00:36:36,840
Go to the studio first.

553
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,244
Sir.
- Come, Anand.

554
00:36:42,523 --> 00:36:45,287
You look so weak? Did
you stop exercising?

555
00:36:45,393 --> 00:36:49,989
Did you call me for a role?
- Yes, l called you here.

556
00:36:50,564 --> 00:36:54,500
l didn't expect it, but Arjun
Das made you act really well, man.

557
00:36:54,602 --> 00:36:57,503
But that movie was stalled.
- l saw the canned rolls.

558
00:36:57,872 --> 00:37:01,000
You have got talent. l
told the producer about you.

559
00:37:01,942 --> 00:37:05,002
He is contemplating on it.
But there are a few obstacles.

560
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:07,674
Go there. The producer is
there outside the floor.

561
00:37:07,782 --> 00:37:09,272
Go straight to him and talk to him.

562
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:10,611
Go and ask him what the role is.

563
00:37:10,718 --> 00:37:14,654
Sir. Director sir, can l know
what the role is?

564
00:37:14,755 --> 00:37:17,952
What's this, man! Of course,
it's the lead actor's role.

565
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:20,425
Talk to him. -Thanks a lot.

566
00:37:30,438 --> 00:37:32,531
Your daughter can't
bear even a little pain.

567
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,301
Bring hot water and a sari.
- What are you doing! Go away.

568
00:37:34,408 --> 00:37:36,569
Suryam, where are you going?

569
00:37:37,411 --> 00:37:39,311
Your wife is giving
birth to your child..

570
00:37:39,413 --> 00:37:41,381
..and you are going to the
party meeting? - ls that so!

571
00:37:41,482 --> 00:37:42,506
He didn't tell us about it.

572
00:37:43,784 --> 00:37:46,309
Son, Anand asked me to
give you this letter..

573
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:49,048
..and to bring you straight away.

574
00:37:50,925 --> 00:37:52,324
One of the fists
that you showed me..

575
00:37:52,426 --> 00:37:55,862
..is about to open up. You
must come here immediately.

576
00:37:55,963 --> 00:37:59,330
Your friend Anand.
- Suryam, it's a baby boy.

577
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:02,567
Child, see your father. Your father.

578
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,728
Your father.

579
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:10,338
Greetings, sir.

580
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:18,350
Sir, he's writer Samara Suryam.
His works were published in..

581
00:38:18,452 --> 00:38:19,476
l read them.

582
00:38:19,887 --> 00:38:21,514
l have also seen your play.

583
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:24,081
So what sort of work
are you looking for?

584
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:27,487
l write stories, l
write sharp dialogues..

585
00:38:27,595 --> 00:38:29,756
Do you write songs?
- Yes, l do.

586
00:38:32,733 --> 00:38:36,829
A prince has to rescue a
princess who has been abducted.

587
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:40,369
This warrior who is going
to her rescue on a horse..

588
00:38:40,474 --> 00:38:43,466
..is singing a song
filled with aggression.

589
00:38:46,147 --> 00:38:49,674
Say it again.
- A warrior is singing..

590
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:52,378
The body is ash,
the breath is fire..

591
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:55,478
..let's prove it to
the world by lighting it.

592
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:56,613
lf it's revolution..

593
00:39:01,729 --> 00:39:03,390
When people call us,
when we become victorious..

594
00:39:03,497 --> 00:39:06,398
..the dawn will be inside us.
- And what if someone..

595
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,400
..comes in the path of that
warrior? - Whoever tries to be..

596
00:39:08,502 --> 00:39:10,402
..an obstacle in my
march of success ..

597
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:21,739
''The body is ash,
the breath is fire..''

598
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:24,477
''..let's prove it to the
world by lighting it.''

599
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:31,751
''The body is ash,
the breath is fire..''

600
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,419
''..let's prove it to the
world by lighting it.''

601
00:39:34,528 --> 00:39:36,758
''When people call us,

602
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:38,855
''..the dawn will be within us.''

603
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,777
''Whoever tries to be
an obstacle in my..''

604
00:39:50,878 --> 00:39:53,506
''.. march of success will be
sent to another world in no time.''

605
00:39:58,319 --> 00:39:59,786
''The body is ash,
the breath is fire..''

606
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,515
''..let's prove it to the
world by lighting it.''

607
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,790
''When people call us,
when we become victorious..''

608
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:07,258
''..the dawn will be inside us.''

609
00:40:07,361 --> 00:40:08,794
''Whoever tries to be
an obstacle in my..''

610
00:40:08,896 --> 00:40:11,956
''.. march of success will be
sent to another world in no time.''

611
00:40:13,133 --> 00:40:16,534
''When a spoilt child dares you
how do you control yourself!''

612
00:40:17,137 --> 00:40:21,073
''Even if you die in the
battlefield you become a martyr.''

613
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:36,186
''Once l raise my sword there
would be no turning back.''

614
00:40:40,594 --> 00:40:44,189
''You will see streams of
blood before you accept defeat.''

615
00:40:48,435 --> 00:40:52,235
''Your hands and legs
will be fed to vultures.''

616
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:54,835
''Whoever dares to
touch my beloved one..''

617
00:40:54,942 --> 00:40:57,376
''..l will slash his
hands and burn them down.''

618
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:05,843
''The body is ash,
the breath is fire..''

619
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:07,853
''..let's prove it to the
world by lighting it.''

620
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:09,855
''When people call us,
when we become victorious..''

621
00:41:09,957 --> 00:41:12,425
''..the dawn will be inside us.''

622
00:41:12,927 --> 00:42:24,720
, ,

623
00:42:26,000 --> 00:43:08,632
, ,

624
00:43:09,043 --> 00:43:10,510
Long live..
- Anand!

625
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:12,010
Long live..
- Anand!

626
00:43:12,112 --> 00:43:13,579
Long live..
- Anand!

627
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,409
Welcome.
- Greetings.

628
00:43:15,516 --> 00:43:17,416
Anand came to join our party.

629
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,982
Till date l have been following
people like Mahatma Gandhi..

630
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:23,613
..and Netaji Shubhash Chandra Bose..

631
00:43:24,258 --> 00:43:28,092
After them it's only you
whom l follow as my leader.

632
00:43:29,630 --> 00:43:32,360
l want to join your party and do as
much service to the people as l can.

633
00:43:32,466 --> 00:43:34,991
lf a star shining in the
sky falls on one's lap..

634
00:43:35,102 --> 00:43:37,093
..it's good for everyone.
What do you say?

635
00:43:38,605 --> 00:43:40,368
Anand, l am very happy.

636
00:43:48,248 --> 00:43:49,579
He's Mr. Bhargav Rao.
- Greetings.

637
00:43:49,683 --> 00:43:51,742
He's Mr. Abhiram. Aaluru Krishnappa.

638
00:43:52,152 --> 00:43:53,244
They are the
presidents of student unions..

639
00:43:53,353 --> 00:43:54,650
..and they are our party personnel.

640
00:43:54,755 --> 00:43:56,017
Please come. Please come.

641
00:43:59,126 --> 00:44:00,616
Long live..
- Veer Pratap.

642
00:44:00,727 --> 00:44:02,024
Long live..
- Veer Pratap.

643
00:44:02,129 --> 00:44:03,562
Long live..
- Veer Pratap.

644
00:44:03,664 --> 00:44:04,688
Long live..
- Veer Pratap.

645
00:44:05,632 --> 00:44:08,499
Tell me honesty what's
with your entry into politics?

646
00:44:08,602 --> 00:44:10,035
ls it a new thought?
- lt seems that Mr. Samara Suryam..

647
00:44:10,137 --> 00:44:12,037
..has taken the
entire responsibility..

648
00:44:12,139 --> 00:44:14,164
..of the politics of Andhra Pradesh.

649
00:44:16,143 --> 00:44:19,374
Do we have to take
cinema actors in our party?

650
00:44:20,814 --> 00:44:23,783
Do we really need such adornment?

651
00:44:24,351 --> 00:44:27,047
l know the reason behind
the success of your movies..

652
00:44:27,154 --> 00:44:29,588
..is the words
inspired by our dreams.

653
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:31,385
To sustain that success
you are joining the party..

654
00:44:31,492 --> 00:44:33,790
..and aspiring political
ambitions. ls it right?

655
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:37,355
l wonder why Mr. Bhargav
Rao is against cinema.

656
00:44:37,464 --> 00:44:40,297
Who are Gopalam,
Samara Suryam and l?

657
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,424
We all belong to the creative field.

658
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:45,302
lt's a different thing to use
cinema as a political platform.

659
00:44:46,106 --> 00:44:51,203
But to succeed in movies we
can't let a person use politics.

660
00:44:51,311 --> 00:44:54,803
l thought you would be happy
about the decision l took.

661
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,077
Every ray is falling together,
have faith in yourself.

662
00:44:58,185 --> 00:45:00,244
Now we are kings, invincible kings.

663
00:45:00,854 --> 00:45:04,085
Mr. Bhargav, it's with
words that our party succeeded.

664
00:45:04,191 --> 00:45:06,819
The rest of the story
is not unknown to you.

665
00:45:07,127 --> 00:45:09,186
Tomorrow cinema can
also be used as a weapon.

666
00:45:09,296 --> 00:45:13,494
lf we walk together we will
reach unreachable heights..

667
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,160
We will never turn back.
Reach the zenith.

668
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:18,830
The supreme power is
with us till we reach there.

669
00:45:19,473 --> 00:45:21,100
The phenomenon
called cinema is also..

670
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:23,108
..an invention of science.
lt's not some devil or ghost..

671
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:25,110
..to be exorcised.
We shall use Anand..

672
00:45:25,212 --> 00:45:28,306
..in the best way we can,
for the benefit of the party.

673
00:45:28,582 --> 00:45:31,107
Our lives will be dedicated
to reach that destination..

674
00:45:31,218 --> 00:45:32,708
..or our lives are of no use.

675
00:45:33,654 --> 00:45:37,420
So Samara Suryam didn't
like me entering the party?

676
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:45,131
Why are you feeling
so shy? Give it to me.

677
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,198
ls your affection for
real or is this acting?

678
00:45:49,303 --> 00:45:52,466
Not just serving, but he
is good at cooking as well.

679
00:45:52,573 --> 00:45:53,597
Eat slowly.

680
00:45:56,476 --> 00:45:57,500
They are our relatives.

681
00:45:58,478 --> 00:46:00,139
l told them not to
cross the kitchen.

682
00:46:00,847 --> 00:46:02,439
They wanted to see you once.

683
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:03,709
lf you don't want to,
l will send them back.

684
00:46:03,817 --> 00:46:06,809
Hey, go away! - lt's alright. Let
them in. Come in. Come in.

685
00:46:08,655 --> 00:46:09,679
She is Sundaramma.

686
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:12,153
She is Mutyalu. My sister-in-law.

687
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:15,221
And where's uncle? Come here.
- Greetings.

688
00:46:15,329 --> 00:46:17,160
He's uncle Shankar. The
rest of them are their kids..

689
00:46:17,264 --> 00:46:18,458
..and your fans.

690
00:46:18,565 --> 00:46:20,760
Have you all eaten your meals?
- Yes.

691
00:46:21,668 --> 00:46:24,762
They wanted to talk to you, but..
- What?

692
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:27,465
Wash your hands. Wash
your hands and come with me.

693
00:46:27,574 --> 00:46:29,166
Let him eat. - First of all,
let him finish his meal..

694
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:30,300
Let him eat..

695
00:46:33,413 --> 00:46:35,608
Come fast.
- What?

696
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,741
Go. Go and see. Go.

697
00:46:39,753 --> 00:46:40,777
What?

698
00:47:19,726 --> 00:47:20,750
This is called
winning over the masses.

699
00:47:21,795 --> 00:47:24,787
The power that Lenin, Hitler
and Stalin toiled hard to get.

700
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,395
The power to win
the hearts of masses.

701
00:47:29,903 --> 00:47:32,736
But l am just an actor.
- They don't think so.

702
00:47:32,839 --> 00:47:35,239
Look at them. They gave
you a permanent place..

703
00:47:35,342 --> 00:47:38,675
..in their hearts. They would
sacrifice their lives for you.

704
00:47:39,946 --> 00:47:41,243
What will you do with this power?

705
00:47:43,283 --> 00:47:44,307
What shall l do?

706
00:47:45,752 --> 00:47:46,776
You can't leave it here.

707
00:47:47,754 --> 00:47:49,415
You have to increase
it by a thousand times.

708
00:47:49,523 --> 00:47:50,922
You have to use it for the party.

709
00:47:54,828 --> 00:47:57,490
Everything's there in your
face and the silver screen.

710
00:48:11,812 --> 00:48:14,337
Don't say no to reservations.
- Don't say no.

711
00:48:14,448 --> 00:48:16,939
Don't say no to reservations.
- Don't say no.

712
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:19,917
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.

713
00:48:20,354 --> 00:48:22,948
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.

714
00:48:23,824 --> 00:48:26,850
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.

715
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,622
The suppressed should prosper.
- Should prosper!

716
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:32,358
The suppressed should prosper.
- Should prosper!

717
00:48:32,466 --> 00:48:34,866
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.

718
00:48:34,968 --> 00:48:37,368
Don't say no to reservations.
- Don't say no.

719
00:48:38,505 --> 00:48:41,030
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.

720
00:48:41,341 --> 00:48:42,399
We are waiting for your
orders to arrest them.

721
00:48:42,509 --> 00:48:44,033
They are doing this so
that we would arrest them.

722
00:48:44,544 --> 00:48:45,772
Why are you lying on the tracks now?

723
00:48:45,879 --> 00:48:48,313
To make you hear our
demand for reservations..

724
00:48:48,415 --> 00:48:51,407
..for all the
backward classes and castes.

725
00:48:51,518 --> 00:48:53,315
Either the law must be
rewritten to give reservations..

726
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,911
..to the backward classes,
or we must die here.

727
00:48:56,022 --> 00:48:57,717
Your action is
troublesome for the people.

728
00:48:57,824 --> 00:49:00,315
People should say that. Or
the passengers should ask me..

729
00:49:00,427 --> 00:49:03,055
..to stop this fight. - l'm
telling you to get up from here.

730
00:49:03,463 --> 00:49:06,330
Either our demands
should be answered..

731
00:49:06,433 --> 00:49:08,333
..or the screams of
the dying martyrs..

732
00:49:08,435 --> 00:49:10,767
..should reach the
central government in Delhi.

733
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:12,566
Long live..
- Revolution.

734
00:49:12,672 --> 00:49:14,003
Long live..
- Revolution.

735
00:49:14,107 --> 00:49:16,701
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.

736
00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:19,404
There is only one way to equality.
- Reservations.

737
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,517
Long live..
- Revolution.

738
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:26,847
Long live..
- Revolution.

739
00:50:00,587 --> 00:50:01,986
Arrest all of them.

740
00:50:02,422 --> 00:50:04,117
Come on. Put all them in the van.

741
00:50:29,249 --> 00:51:03,382

742
00:51:04,084 --> 00:51:07,781
''There's fragrance of flowers..''

743
00:51:07,888 --> 00:51:11,619
''There's love in the air..''

744
00:51:11,925 --> 00:51:15,452

745
00:51:15,562 --> 00:51:19,794

''..as beautiful as the flowers.''

752
00:51:47,761 --> 00:51:54,223
''My life got a new
meaning in your arms.''

00:51:55,201 --> 00:51:59,069
''My life got a new meaning.''

754
00:51:59,172 --> 00:52:03,006
''There's fragrance of flowers..''

755
00:52:03,109 --> 00:52:06,636
''There's love in the air..''

756
00:52:07,147 --> 00:52:11,174
''Let me laugh silently..''

757
00:52:11,284 --> 00:52:14,811
''..to fall in your arms.''

758
00:52:34,774 --> 00:52:38,039
''The jasmine is all around.''

759
00:52:38,612 --> 00:52:42,946
''l wonder which
spell you have cast.''

760
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,549

''The stars are shining
at us from the sky.''

764
00:53:11,011 --> 00:53:18,577
''How shall we welcome
the first ray of the sun?''

765
00:53:18,985 --> 00:53:26,653

Uncle, l am changing the sari.
Stay outside for a while.

771
00:53:49,949 --> 00:53:52,816
What's wrong with you!
Are you out of your mind!

772

Why are you getting so close to him?

..you here from
Rajamundry on a train..

You know what l thought?

778
00:54:05,231 --> 00:54:08,064
What all l went through to
make you such a big star?

779
00:54:09,803 --> 00:54:11,634
You didn't have even a
single grain to eat..

780
00:54:11,738 --> 00:54:13,638
..and l taught you
singing, dancing..

781

Shut up! Who brought you to the top?

How much did l spend to
bring you to this position!

784
00:54:24,884 --> 00:54:26,146
Your parents did nothing for you.

785
00:54:27,687 --> 00:54:29,655
Have you done it without
expecting anything in return..

786
00:54:29,756 --> 00:54:30,780
l'll break your teeth.

787
00:54:32,358 --> 00:54:34,656
l left my wife and kids
back in the village.. - Uncle!

788
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:38,390
..and l wandered with you to
every studio.. - Go outside.

789
00:54:39,265 --> 00:54:40,391
You ungrateful woman!

00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,729
l'm going to..
- Leave me.

791
00:54:42,836 --> 00:54:44,667
ln spite of having

792
00:54:44,771 --> 00:54:46,671

803
00:55:57,877 --> 00:56:05,750
''The stars are shining
at us from the sky.''

804
00:56:05,852 --> 00:56:13,258
''How shall we welcome

''l can't survive.''

807
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:35,777
The higher
officials are leaving you..

808
00:56:35,882 --> 00:56:38,248
..as they got scared of
your craze among the masses.

809
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:41,946
Long live leader Samara Suryam.

810
00:56:42,055 --> 00:56:43,955
Long live leader Samara Suryam.

00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,862
Long live hero Anand!

815
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:00,303
Long live hero Anand!

816
00:57:00,406 --> 00:57:01,805
Long live hero Anand!

817
00:57:01,908 --> 00:57:03,273

00:57:06,246 --> 00:57:07,975
Long live leader Samara Suryam.

820
00:57:47,387 --> 00:57:48,513
l can't go back to them.

821
00:57:51,057 --> 00:57:53,025
They would even
kill me if l go there.

822
00:57:55,128 --> 00:57:57,119
My mother and father
have taken his side.

823
00:57:59,399 --> 00:58:00,889
All of them are beating..

824
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,164
l don't want money.

825
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:10,566
l don't want cinema.

826
00:58:13,579 --> 00:58:15,069
l just want a place to stay.

827
00:58:34,267 --> 00:58:36,292
Long live leader Jai Prakasham!

828
00:58:36,402 --> 00:58:38,393
Long live leader Jai Prakasham!

00:58:50,183 --> 00:58:51,912
Long live leader Jai Prakasham!

830
00:58:52,018 --> 00:58:54,919
l don't think they presented me
this shawl, sword and shield..

831
00:58:55,021 --> 00:58:56,921
..because they are happy
with what l have done.

832
00:58:57,690 --> 00:58:59,920
But they gave me
those as a reminder..

833
00:59:00,026 --> 00:59:03,928
..of the long battle ahead.
You need not have any fear..

834
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:07,022
..that l might ask for a
golden sword after this.

835
00:59:08,701 --> 00:59:11,932
For the reputation of this party
when l would sacrifice my life..

836
00:59:12,038 --> 00:59:13,938
..all l need is a some
tears from my party-men..

837
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,940
..on my grave. That will
be more precious to me..

838
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:18,510
..than fame and wealth..

839
00:59:53,146 --> 00:59:54,977
Now hero Anand will
speak a few words.

840
00:59:56,015 --> 00:59:57,414
You have put me in a tough spot.

841
01:00:05,758 --> 01:00:06,986
Sit down.

842
01:00:13,466 --> 01:00:16,060
Am l a person of speeches?

843
01:00:18,271 --> 01:00:19,295
No.

844
01:00:20,773 --> 01:00:23,742
Do l say something l don't mean?

Do l know speaking in a
poetic language? - No.

But l know about speaking my heart.

We have only one leader.

We've only one commander-in-chief.

Your friend is supreme in movies.

852
01:00:48,434 --> 01:00:51,198
He is a genius who can
mesmerize anyone with words.

853
01:00:53,139 --> 01:00:55,039
When the commander-in-chief
orders us to come forward?

854
01:00:55,141 --> 01:00:56,665
We will come forward.

855
01:00:57,577 --> 01:01:00,546
lf he invites us to sacrifice
our blood in the next elections?

856
01:01:00,646 --> 01:01:01,670
We will sacrifice our blood.

857
01:01:04,684 --> 01:01:06,515
Long live Samara Suryam!

858
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:08,211

Long live Anand! Long live Anand!

862
01:01:17,463 --> 01:01:19,397
Long live Anand!

863
01:01:24,203 --> 01:01:25,227
Do you want a coolie, madam?

864
01:01:32,545 --> 01:01:34,809
Greetings, madam. The train
arrived five minutes earlier.

865
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:37,239

lt will become 400 by next year.

871
01:02:42,502 --> 01:02:43,696
An illustrious family.

872
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:53,278
l have been searching
for you since two months..

873
01:02:53,379 --> 01:02:56,507
..to find out who my
lndumati is, where she belongs to.

874
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,014
They called me a fool.

875
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:10,922
But l must be convinced
first that it was foolishness.

876
01:03:12,331 --> 01:03:14,299
l wrote to you to come
here and you left everything..

877
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,424
..and came here? Why?

878
01:03:22,742 --> 01:03:24,300
For a couple of
lines of your poetry.

879
01:03:30,082 --> 01:03:33,950
You wrote me a letter to
come here and l am here.

880
01:03:36,989 --> 01:03:38,320
l went against my father and
mother who gave me birth..

881
01:03:38,424 --> 01:03:39,789
..and came here.

882
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,056
But who am l here?

883
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:51,594
My dream.

884
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,464
My love.

885
01:03:57,643 --> 01:03:58,667
My life.

886
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:38,509
l am with you
every beautiful moment.

887
01:04:40,086 --> 01:04:42,680
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.

888
01:04:44,156 --> 01:04:46,386
The moments that we spent together..

889
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:50,053
..has moved my heart
like never before.

890
01:04:55,001 --> 01:04:57,401
Joy at first moment,
fear in the next..

891
01:04:57,503 --> 01:04:59,403
..the moment when
tears of joy come..

892
01:04:59,505 --> 01:05:01,405
..out of the eye in
the beloved one's arms.

893
01:05:01,507 --> 01:05:05,409
..the moment when
one forgets the world.

894
01:05:05,511 --> 01:05:08,969
l am with you
every beautiful moment.

895
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:17,087
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.

896
01:05:18,491 --> 01:05:21,983
The moment when one forgets ethics.

897
01:05:22,895 --> 01:05:25,420
The moment when one
forgets the difference..

898
01:05:25,531 --> 01:05:27,431
..between right and wrong.

899
01:05:27,533 --> 01:05:30,502
..when one forgets what's
the beginning and the end.

900
01:05:30,603 --> 01:05:34,505
We started a new
life with one another.

901
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:39,611
l gave up shame, l
saw my dreams in you..

902
01:05:40,613 --> 01:05:42,444
There is nothing that
can separate me now..

903
01:05:42,548 --> 01:05:44,175
..from your beauty.

904
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:55,453
l don't care about the
past or the future..

905
01:05:55,561 --> 01:06:00,191
..all l'm concerned about is,
this particular moment with you.

906
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,065
l am with you
every beautiful moment.

907
01:06:05,137 --> 01:06:10,803
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.

908
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:13,471
l am with you
every beautiful moment.

909
01:06:13,579 --> 01:06:17,777
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.

910
01:06:27,693 --> 01:06:31,527
They couldn't do it, but
we are about to achieve it.

911
01:06:32,531 --> 01:06:34,499
And the reason behind it is that..

912
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,966
..we are about to form
a people's government.

913
01:06:37,536 --> 01:06:38,560
Your government.

914
01:06:42,675 --> 01:06:43,699
Greetings.

915
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:49,013
What happened to you?
- lt's nothing. Just a minor fever.

916
01:06:54,086 --> 01:06:56,520
A small donation for
the next election..

917
01:06:56,622 --> 01:06:59,250
Your money is not important for us.

918
01:06:59,825 --> 01:07:02,555
Go to people and show them
your face. That's enough.

919
01:07:02,661 --> 01:07:04,526
That's more than
millions of rupees for us.

920
01:07:05,164 --> 01:07:07,758
l became a star with
your party's mercy.

921
01:07:08,667 --> 01:07:10,532
ln the next election
the party has decided..

922
01:07:10,636 --> 01:07:12,968
..to make you contest
from one constituency.

923
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:14,539
He took this decision in
spite of a lot of opposition..

924
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:17,165
..from many quarters.
- l opposed this decision.

925
01:07:18,310 --> 01:07:20,540
There are many party
personnel and many people..

926
01:07:20,646 --> 01:07:23,547
..who toiled hard for the party,
but ignoring them and giving..

927
01:07:23,649 --> 01:07:26,550
..a seat to an actor, even
though he's my best friend..

928
01:07:26,652 --> 01:07:29,280
l opposed it as it was not
right to give a seat to an actor.

929
01:07:30,322 --> 01:07:31,914
But he discarded by view.

930
01:07:32,324 --> 01:07:34,053
He said that Anand
represents our dreams.

931
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:37,854
You have been a
party personnel for long.

932
01:07:39,198 --> 01:07:40,995
Now take a step forward.

933
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:48,562
lt's in your hands if we
would be the ruling party..

934
01:07:48,674 --> 01:07:52,201
..or the opposition
in the assembly hall.

935
01:07:55,347 --> 01:07:57,747
Will l win if l
contest the elections?

936
01:07:58,784 --> 01:08:00,752
Even if God contests
against you, you will win.

937
01:08:02,822 --> 01:08:06,622
What was her name? Kanchana?
- No, Kalpana.

938
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:26,236
, ,

939
01:08:26,745 --> 01:08:28,906
''Hello, Mr. Edupakshi!''

940
01:08:29,014 --> 01:08:31,141

''Now you would lose your hearts.''

948
01:08:50,936 --> 01:08:55,134
''You can't resist my charms.''

949
01:08:55,875 --> 01:09:00,175
''You would me

''l am 17 now.''

954
01:09:34,713 --> 01:09:39,343
''You are unfortunate
if you are married.''

955
01:09:39,451 --> 01:09:43,046
''You won't get me now.''

956
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:49,160
''l have got hundreds of admirers.''

957
01:09:49,261 --> 01:09:52,856
''And you are one of them.''

958
01:09:54,166 --> 01:09:58,796
''You can't see anything
else when l am around.''

959
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:03,771
''When l see you once your
day is filled with joy.''

960
01:10:03,876 --> 01:10:08,245
''l am the muse of many.''

961
01:10:08,747 --> 01:10:10,738
''Hello, Mr. Edupakshi!''

962
01:10:10,849 --> 01:10:13,079

''l am waiting for you.
l am watching you.''

966
01:10:49,154 --> 01:10:54,091
''You can't escape from me.
lt won't be easy for you.''

967
01:10:56,528 --> 01:11:01,192
''l am inviting you.
You can't say no to me.''

968
01:11:01,300 --> 01:11:06,033
''lt's a matter of
time before l get you.''

969
01:11:06,939 --> 01:11:11,501
''My mother brought
me up only for you.''

970
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:16,270
''She let me out only for you.''

971
01:11:16,382 --> 01:11:21,319
''She gave me her
beauty in inheritance.''

''l have..''

979
01:11:38,237 --> 01:11:40,797
lt's alright if you didn't
like her. l will book Sarojini.

980
01:11:40,906 --> 01:11:42,931
She acted with you in
three movies in a row, so..

981
01:11:43,342 --> 01:11:45,537
lt's alright. lf you didn't
like her.. - What are you saying!

982
01:11:45,911 --> 01:11:48,471
You are rejecting this girl?
Why did you reject her?

983
01:11:48,580 --> 01:11:50,013
l can't tell you, but no.

984
01:11:50,115 --> 01:11:51,810
Do not interfere in
this unnecessarily.

985
01:11:51,917 --> 01:11:54,351
l liked that girl. You won't
get another girl like her.

986
01:11:54,453 --> 01:11:57,286
You will regret it later.
- l don't mind, but don't say no.

987
01:11:57,523 --> 01:11:59,821
She's an educated girl.
- l am leaving.

988
01:11:59,925 --> 01:12:01,153
Are you coming with me
or will you stay here?

989
01:12:02,127 --> 01:12:04,322
Mr. Sambayya, she's very beautiful.

990
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,262
Meet her and give
her advance amount.

991
01:12:07,066 --> 01:12:08,090
l will convince him.

992
01:12:10,369 --> 01:12:13,930
Trust my word. lt will go well.

993
01:12:27,619 --> 01:12:28,847
Greetings.

994
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:31,579
Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, sir.

995
01:12:34,326 --> 01:12:36,021
So Ramakrishna, you didn't
give me sweets on your son's..

996
01:12:36,128 --> 01:12:37,152
Greetings, brother.

997
01:12:39,998 --> 01:12:43,195
Kalpana, stand up.
- Why should l stand up?

998
01:12:43,302 --> 01:12:45,133
This is democracy. Democracy.

999
01:12:45,237 --> 01:12:46,534
Everyone is equal here.
- What they teach you..

1000
01:12:46,638 --> 01:12:48,469
..in school is different
from the cinema field.

1001
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:49,871
When you see big
people and cine-stars..

1002
01:12:49,975 --> 01:12:52,375
..it won't harm you if
you stand up and wish them.

1003
01:12:52,478 --> 01:12:54,537
And you are giving
me the democracy crap?

1004
01:12:54,646 --> 01:12:55,874
Come on. Get up.

1005
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:02,944
Set your lights.
- Order. Order.

1006
01:13:03,055 --> 01:13:04,079
Scene 4. Take 1

1007
01:13:04,656 --> 01:13:05,884
Action!

1008
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:08,249
Why did you leave me alone?

1009
01:13:10,929 --> 01:13:12,897
l loved you more than my life.

1010
01:13:14,266 --> 01:13:16,427
l worshiped you forever
in the temple of my heart.

1011
01:13:16,535 --> 01:13:17,559
Did you forget it?

1012
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,372
Did you forget your beloved one?

1013
01:13:28,347 --> 01:13:32,044
l am asking your eyes.
l want an answer.

1014
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:42,119
Ask your heart. Ask your heart.

1015
01:13:42,461 --> 01:13:44,326
lt's your dialogue, sir.
- Cut. Cut.

1016
01:13:45,597 --> 01:13:46,996
You forgot it.

1017
01:13:49,568 --> 01:13:52,298
Lights off. Fan on.
- Sorry.

1018
01:13:56,175 --> 01:13:57,665
Kalpana. Kalpana.

1019
01:14:00,179 --> 01:14:02,272
l'm not coming. l
won't go to the set.

1020
01:14:02,381 --> 01:14:03,939
Let them do what they want to do.

1021
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:06,110
l don't want acting or cinema.

1022
01:14:06,652 --> 01:14:08,586
Mr. Anand is waiting
for you in the sets.

1023
01:14:15,461 --> 01:14:17,019
Laughing is wrong. Talking is wrong.

1024
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:18,689
l can't sit. l can't stand.

1025
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:20,188
No matter whatever l
do it's a mistake.

1026
01:14:20,632 --> 01:14:23,192
l don't want it, granny.
- The producer is here.

1027
01:14:24,269 --> 01:14:26,601
l can't come, sir. l don't like him.

1028
01:14:27,573 --> 01:14:29,302
Kalpana, mind your language.

1029
01:14:30,342 --> 01:14:32,139
All the times he sees me
as if he would devour me.

1030
01:14:32,244 --> 01:14:33,643
Am l some spirit or some ghost?

1031
01:14:34,379 --> 01:14:36,711
l don't want movies, sir.
l will go back and study.

1032
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,570
Are you coming to
the shooting or not?

1033
01:15:02,674 --> 01:15:03,698
Say yes.

1034
01:15:06,445 --> 01:16:00,955
, ,

1035
01:16:01,366 --> 01:16:04,631
''l am here to rescue you.''

1036
01:16:05,637 --> 01:16:09,403
''l'll come as the
commander-in-chief if you call me.''

1037
01:16:09,508 --> 01:16:16,676
''l am here to wipe out the
troubles of the orphans.''

1038
01:16:17,282 --> 01:16:25,382
''lf l call them the rivers

1039
01:16:25,490 --> 01:16:29,085
''The sky will bend down..''

1040
01:16:29,194 --> 01:16:34,097
''..and give the boons l wish for.''

1041
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:40,536
''Do not trust anything
except your hard work.''

1042
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:43,836
''l am here to rescue you.''

1043
01:16:44,876 --> 01:16:48,744
''l'll come as the
commander-in-chief if you call me.''

1044
01:17:36,928 --> 01:17:39,522
''One person's mischief..''

1045
01:17:40,866 --> 01:17:43,426
''..is other person's suffering.''

1046
01:17:44,803 --> 01:17:48,762
''lf ever there is a
conspiracy against you..''

1047
01:17:48,874 --> 01:17:51,570
''..l will unmask the culprits.
l will protect dharma.''

1048
01:17:52,744 --> 01:17:55,406
''The sweat of the
hard working people..''

1049
01:17:56,715 --> 01:17:59,275
'' Before it's lost in the air..''

1050
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:08,285
''l will get you what you deserve.
l am there with you.''

1051
01:18:08,393 --> 01:18:11,590
''The sky will bend down..''

1052
01:18:11,697 --> 01:18:15,565
''..and give the boons l wish for.''

1053
01:18:15,667 --> 01:18:22,937
''Do not trust anything
except for your hard work.''

1054
01:18:23,308 --> 01:18:26,436
''l am here to rescue you.''

1055
01:18:27,546 --> 01:18:31,346
''l'll come as the
commander-in-chief if you call me.''

1056
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:14,251
''We have to fight back
against the tyranny.''

1057
01:19:15,594 --> 01:19:17,926
''Then there will be
smiles all around.''

1058
01:19:19,564 --> 01:19:23,398
''A sun will dawn in every house.''

1059
01:19:23,502 --> 01:19:25,993
''There will be no
trace of darkness.''

1060
01:19:27,405 --> 01:19:29,805
''Light will prevail.''

1061
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:33,743
''Our lives will get
rid of the darkness.''

1062
01:19:35,313 --> 01:19:38,942
''The hard working people are
welcome all over the world.''

1063
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:42,281
''Your path will lead
you to your destination.''

1064
01:19:42,387 --> 01:19:45,845
''The light is in this direction..''

1065
01:19:46,358 --> 01:19:49,919
''There will be no darkness around.''

1066
01:19:50,362 --> 01:19:54,298
''He who is ready to
fight all the battles..''

1067
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:57,698
''..will become
victorious eventually.''

1068
01:19:57,803 --> 01:20:00,897
''l am here to rescue you.''

1069
01:20:02,073 --> 01:20:05,770
''l'll come as the
commander-in-chief if you call me.''

1070
01:20:05,877 --> 01:20:13,409
''l am here to wipe out the
troubles of the orphans.''

1071
01:20:13,852 --> 01:20:21,588
''lf l call them the rivers
will join forces with me.''

1072
01:20:21,693 --> 01:20:25,322
''The sky will bend down..''

1073
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:29,730
''..and give the boons l wish for.''

1074
01:20:29,835 --> 01:20:37,435
''Do not trust anything
except for your hard work.''

1075
01:20:40,712 --> 01:20:42,680
Cut. Cut. Who is the
supplier of that gun?

1076
01:20:42,781 --> 01:20:44,578
Do not forget our
sign in the elections.

1077
01:21:34,766 --> 01:21:37,496
Do not forget it. Do not forget.

1078
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:43,404
They shot Anand and killed him.

1079
01:21:43,508 --> 01:21:45,499
What rubbish are you talking!
- Who did it? - l don't know.

1080
01:21:45,610 --> 01:21:46,872
How did it happen?
- l don't know.

1081
01:21:46,978 --> 01:21:50,038
Who told you that he has died?
- Everyone's saying so.

1082
01:22:11,469 --> 01:22:14,097
The incident that took
place has shaken the state.

1083
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:17,431
For hero Anand we
have to answer back.

1084
01:22:17,542 --> 01:22:20,443
We have to answer back
by making our party..

1085
01:22:20,545 --> 01:22:23,105
..led by Mr. Jai
Prakasham victorious.

1086
01:22:26,685 --> 01:22:28,050
Another attempt to bring us down.

1087
01:22:28,553 --> 01:22:31,454
To weaken our party,
to kill our chief man..

1088
01:22:31,556 --> 01:22:33,922
..they conspired against us.

1089
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:39,494
ln movies they use
fake guns while shooting.

1090
01:22:39,864 --> 01:22:41,661
That's how it happens. But here,
they brought a real gun..

1091
01:22:41,766 --> 01:22:43,791
..and shot him in the neck,
and they want us to believe..

1092
01:22:43,902 --> 01:22:45,460
..that it's just an accident.
How would we believe it?

1093
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:46,969
How would we believe it?

1094
01:22:47,238 --> 01:22:50,833
They said, that if their party
wins, streams of wine will flow.

1095
01:22:51,576 --> 01:22:54,568
Enough of fooling the
public all these years.

1096
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:56,476
Do not get fooled in this election.

1097
01:22:56,581 --> 01:22:59,141
Do not forget your sign.

1098
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:17,498
Everything is coming together,
have faith in yourself.

1099
01:23:17,602 --> 01:23:20,093
Now we are kings, invincible kings.

1100
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:27,507
lf we walk together, we will
reach unreachable heights..

1101
01:23:27,612 --> 01:23:29,842
We will never turn back.
Reach the zenith.

1102
01:23:29,948 --> 01:23:31,040
Did our party win the election?

1103
01:23:31,149 --> 01:23:32,844
We got 155 seats.

1104
01:24:18,696 --> 01:24:21,164
You didn't recognize
her? She is Kalpana.

1105
01:24:21,699 --> 01:24:23,564
Poor girl! She got
completely scared.

1106
01:24:24,102 --> 01:24:25,228
She came to the hospital everyday..

1107
01:24:25,336 --> 01:24:27,133
..as you were injured
right in front of her.

1108
01:24:34,813 --> 01:24:36,576
When are you coming to
sing a duet with me?

1109
01:24:39,050 --> 01:24:40,244
ln another ten days.

1110
01:24:40,985 --> 01:24:42,009
Watch out.

1111
01:24:53,298 --> 01:24:54,322
Greetings, sir.

1112
01:24:57,168 --> 01:24:58,260
Come here. Come.

1113
01:24:58,937 --> 01:25:00,199
A warrior doesn't care
about the injuries..

1114
01:25:00,305 --> 01:25:01,602
..and a worker doesn't
worry about the work.

1115
01:25:01,706 --> 01:25:03,071
l know you would be perfectly fine.

1116
01:25:03,174 --> 01:25:05,074
l came to know that you
have taken a decision.

1117
01:25:05,777 --> 01:25:07,711
You shouldn't talk too much.
You shouldn't talk too much.

1118
01:25:07,812 --> 01:25:09,939
You should be giving
some rest to your throat.

1119
01:25:11,082 --> 01:25:12,208
Without you how can we..

1120
01:25:12,317 --> 01:25:15,150
Yes, l want to step
aside from active politics.

1121
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:17,177
How can you ask the
headmaster to write exams!

1122
01:25:17,288 --> 01:25:19,153
Without you the party
would become orphan..

1123
01:25:19,257 --> 01:25:22,055
Nothing would happen.
My brothers are strong.

1124
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:23,923
They are intelligent. Come.

1125
01:25:24,028 --> 01:25:25,689
Select one among you
as the chief minister.

1126
01:25:25,797 --> 01:25:28,732
Form a government.
Fulfill party's objectives.

1127
01:25:28,833 --> 01:25:30,357
What do you say! What do you say!

1128
01:25:33,972 --> 01:25:34,996
Greetings.

1129
01:25:53,358 --> 01:25:55,986
You were discharged from the
hospital yesterday itself.

1130
01:25:58,763 --> 01:26:00,321
Why didn't you take rest and..

1131
01:26:00,431 --> 01:26:01,762
Why did he take such a
decision all of a sudden!

1132
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:03,667
Some people are thinking
of making Bhargav the CM..

1133
01:26:03,768 --> 01:26:05,736
Some are thinking of
giving me the chair.

1134
01:26:06,337 --> 01:26:08,771
You?
- What did Prakasham sir say?

1135
01:26:09,307 --> 01:26:12,743
What do you say? The party
is waiting for your decision.

1136
01:26:13,178 --> 01:26:14,202
What did Mr. Bhargav say?

1137
01:26:15,046 --> 01:26:16,070
Forget about him.

1138
01:26:19,717 --> 01:26:20,809
Leave it to me.

1139
01:26:22,854 --> 01:26:23,878
Shall we go?

1140
01:26:28,159 --> 01:26:31,686
Even though our party's
won with a great majority..

1141
01:26:31,796 --> 01:26:34,697
..under Mr. Jai
Prakasham's leadership..

1142
01:26:34,799 --> 01:26:37,700
..since he has
rejected the CM's post..

1143
01:26:37,802 --> 01:26:42,364
..we all gathered here to
select a CM among us by voting.

1144
01:26:42,473 --> 01:26:44,304
We can elect someone unanimously.

1145
01:26:44,776 --> 01:26:46,710
But if there is more
than one candidate..

1146
01:26:46,811 --> 01:26:47,835
..then we will
have to go for voting.

1147
01:26:48,913 --> 01:26:51,746
The members can announce
their candidate's names.

1148
01:26:52,317 --> 01:26:56,253
l propose Mr. Bhargav
Rao's name for the CM's post.

1149
01:26:56,354 --> 01:26:57,412
l support him.

1150
01:26:59,224 --> 01:27:01,715
l propose Mr. Samara Suryam's name..

1151
01:27:01,826 --> 01:27:05,728
..for the CM's post.
- l support him. l support him.

1152
01:27:05,830 --> 01:27:08,060
We support him. We support him.

1153
01:27:11,836 --> 01:27:13,997

1154

Long live Samara Suryam.

1175
01:27:59,884 --> 01:28:00,976
Long live Samara Suryam.

1176
01:28:19,357 --> 01:28:21,052
Who is Pushpa?

1177
01:28:24,595 --> 01:28:26,222
You called that name
when you were shot.

1178
01:28:27,064 --> 01:28:28,554
You called that name
when you were unconscious.

1179
01:28:29,500 --> 01:28:31,934
You called that name
twice outside the hospital.

1180
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:34,932
You called that name four
times. Who is that Pushpa?

1181
01:28:36,340 --> 01:28:37,932
What's the relation
between Pushpa and me?

1182
01:28:40,344 --> 01:28:44,110
You are a person
diametrically opposite to Pushpa.

1183
01:28:44,982 --> 01:28:50,079
What?
- Pushpa is a disciplined girl.

1184
01:28:51,923 --> 01:28:52,947
And l?

1185
01:28:54,258 --> 01:28:56,317
You don't even know
what discipline means.

1186
01:28:57,495 --> 01:28:59,895
Pusha is reserved.
She says one word..

1187
01:28:59,997 --> 01:29:01,965
..in place of four words.

1188
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:04,431
And one needs to pay
you to shut your mouth.

1189
01:29:08,606 --> 01:29:09,630
Pushpa is a family lady.

1190
01:29:11,275 --> 01:29:12,401
She's another name of purity.

1191
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:14,205
She's epitome of patience.
She has a good nature.

1192
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,407
She is always calm.
She respects elders.

1193
01:29:19,016 --> 01:29:21,348
She's pure gold.
- And..

1194
01:29:22,253 --> 01:29:23,447
You are arrogant
that you are educated.

1195
01:29:24,555 --> 01:29:25,579
You use English a lot.

1196
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,452
You are too proud of
being intelligent.

1197
01:29:27,625 --> 01:29:29,024
You always think of one-upmanship.

1198
01:29:29,327 --> 01:29:31,056
Then why did you
call me Pushpa then?

1199
01:29:51,716 --> 01:29:53,377
Why did you call me Pushpa?

1200
01:29:55,519 --> 01:29:57,077
You too have a similar face.

1201
01:30:06,063 --> 01:30:09,464
The same eyes, the same
nose, the same mouth..

1202
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:14,430
The similarities between
you and her are too many.

1203
01:30:24,281 --> 01:30:26,340
l know you are lying.
l don't believe you.

1204
01:30:29,286 --> 01:30:33,052
l can't bring Pushpa
here to make you believe me.

1205
01:30:34,525 --> 01:30:36,117
Why? lsn't she there?

1206
01:30:43,701 --> 01:30:47,102
You look exactly like Pushpa.
- l don't believe you.

1207
01:30:47,638 --> 01:30:48,662
But it's great.

1208
01:30:49,673 --> 01:30:50,731
ls Pushpa your wife?

1209
01:30:54,645 --> 01:30:55,669
Did you love her so much?

1210
01:30:57,381 --> 01:30:58,609
Do you love me as well?

1211
01:31:00,684 --> 01:31:05,417
Look. The same eyes, the
same nose, the same face..

1212
01:31:06,223 --> 01:31:07,451
Do you feel the
same love towards me?

1213
01:31:24,809 --> 01:31:28,176
Now tell me. Tell me about Pushpa.

1214
01:31:30,214 --> 01:31:31,442
Or else l will jump into the water.

1215
01:31:31,749 --> 01:31:33,774
The picture will stop. The
producer will go bankrupt.

1216
01:31:36,620 --> 01:31:37,644
What?

1217
01:31:40,091 --> 01:31:41,581
Sit down. Your dress
will get drenched.

1218
01:31:42,159 --> 01:31:44,127
Tell me then. Tell me.

1219
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:53,794
Pushpa.

1220
01:31:55,806 --> 01:31:59,674
lf l wouldn't have married,
what would you have done?

1221
01:32:00,511 --> 01:32:03,071
l would've gone to jail.
- To jail?

1222
01:32:03,481 --> 01:32:06,075
Yes. With Mahatma Gandhi,
or with Kasturi Bai..

1223
01:32:06,183 --> 01:32:09,175
..l would've participated
in the freedom struggle.

1224
01:32:09,487 --> 01:32:10,818
l would've
participated in hunger strikes.

1225
01:32:11,122 --> 01:32:12,214
The police would've arrested me.

1226
01:32:12,523 --> 01:32:14,184
So you are stuck with
me instead of the jail?

1227
01:32:15,693 --> 01:32:16,785
l'll bash you up.

1228
01:32:18,629 --> 01:32:20,460
Mother, my wife's beating me.

1229
01:32:22,633 --> 01:32:23,657
And then?

1230
01:32:24,835 --> 01:32:27,099
Oh! What's this! This shiny thing?

1231
01:32:28,739 --> 01:32:30,604
lt was there on that girl's cheeks.

1232
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:31,732
She is a princess in this movie.

1233
01:32:32,576 --> 01:32:34,601
How did it stick to my face?

1234
01:32:35,646 --> 01:32:38,479
You must be standing too
close to her. - Yes, like this.

1235
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:40,840
And then?
- Kalpana..

1236
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:43,544
Tell me something else.

1237
01:32:46,757 --> 01:32:47,781
The rain won't stop.

1238
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:50,484
Tell me.

1239
01:32:51,729 --> 01:32:54,425
When you hugged her what
was going on in your mind?

1240
01:33:02,173 --> 01:33:04,471
l was thinking about some
other girl. - About whom?

1241
01:33:06,177 --> 01:33:09,146
A girl who has large
eyes, small hands..

1242
01:33:09,246 --> 01:33:13,342
..a big mouth, and is a
bit innocent. - ls it me?

1243
01:33:17,688 --> 01:33:20,179
What are you thinking now?
- About that girl.

1244
01:33:25,663 --> 01:33:27,392
lt's a mole. You can't wipe it out.

1245
01:33:28,732 --> 01:33:29,756
ls it there to
cast off the evil eye?

1246
01:33:31,268 --> 01:33:33,202
So you are that beautiful?

1247
01:33:34,205 --> 01:33:35,229
Shall l tell you the truth?

1248
01:33:36,807 --> 01:33:39,901
Ugly eyes. Crooked nose.

1249
01:33:40,911 --> 01:33:42,173
Big mouth.

1250
01:33:43,247 --> 01:33:47,377
This mole is the only part
that's beautiful in your body.

1251
01:33:47,585 --> 01:33:49,712
l want it.
- You can't take it.

1252
01:33:50,621 --> 01:33:52,248
l want it.
- You can't take it.

1253
01:33:52,356 --> 01:33:53,755
l want..

1254
01:33:55,292 --> 01:33:56,316
Demon.

1255
01:34:02,733 --> 01:34:03,757
Demon.

1256
01:34:04,001 --> 01:34:50,877
, ,

1257
01:34:51,582 --> 01:34:53,243
37. 37.

1258
01:34:54,285 --> 01:34:57,482
One. Two. Three. Four.

1259
01:34:59,056 --> 01:35:23,404
, ,

1260
01:35:24,048 --> 01:35:27,484
''O moonlight, go away.''

1261
01:35:28,385 --> 01:35:31,548
''Do not entice me.''

1262
01:35:31,722 --> 01:35:34,885
''There's a stream of
nectar flowing in the eyes.''

1263
01:35:35,659 --> 01:35:38,526
''l am craving for
my beloved's kiss.''

1264
01:35:39,396 --> 01:35:46,564
''l am shaking. l am quaking.''

1265
01:35:46,937 --> 01:35:53,308
''Am l the reason behind it?
lt's none other than you.''

1266
01:35:54,411 --> 01:35:57,710
''O moonlight, go away.''

1267
01:35:58,549 --> 01:36:01,814
''Do not entice me.''

1268
01:36:02,019 --> 01:36:05,386
''There's a stream of
nectar flowing in the eyes.''

1269
01:36:05,856 --> 01:36:08,848
''l am craving for
my beloved's kiss.''

1270
01:36:09,693 --> 01:36:16,531
''l am shaking. l am quaking.''

1271
01:36:17,101 --> 01:36:23,529
''Am l the reason behind it?
lt's none other than you.''

1272
01:36:24,508 --> 01:37:01,645
, ,

1273
01:37:02,479 --> 01:37:09,976
''lt's moonlight or my eyes?
What's more intoxicating?''

1274
01:37:13,891 --> 01:37:21,388
''Come to me and rub
your cheeks off mine.''

1275
01:37:21,765 --> 01:37:24,791
''You say something.''

1276
01:37:25,569 --> 01:37:28,538
''Let me hear something.''

1277
01:37:29,506 --> 01:37:35,570
''Let me immerse myself
in the ocean of love.''

1278
01:37:36,513 --> 01:37:39,744
''O moonlight, go away.''

1279
01:37:40,617 --> 01:37:43,950
''Do not entice me.''

1280
01:37:44,054 --> 01:37:47,421
''There's a stream of
nectar flowing in the eyes.''

1281
01:37:47,825 --> 01:37:50,817
''l am craving for
my beloved's kiss.''

1282
01:37:51,662 --> 01:37:58,591
''l am shaking. l am quaking.''

1283
01:37:59,136 --> 01:38:05,097
''Am l the reason behind it?
lt's none other than you.''

1284
01:38:05,476 --> 01:38:40,371
, ,

1285
01:38:40,777 --> 01:38:43,974
''Even when l close my eyes..''

1286
01:38:44,081 --> 01:38:48,074
''..the dreams come
and flirt with me.''

1287
01:38:48,185 --> 01:38:51,484
''lf l come into your arms..''

1288
01:38:51,588 --> 01:38:55,888
''..l will forget
everything till dawn.''

1289
01:38:55,993 --> 01:38:58,985
''Like the summer moonlight..''

1290
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:02,897
''Like the haunting eyes..''

1291
01:39:04,034 --> 01:39:09,904
''..the dreams are tormenting me.''

1292
01:39:11,008 --> 01:39:14,205
''O moonlight, go away.''

1293
01:39:14,878 --> 01:39:17,904
''Do not entice me.''

1294
01:39:18,015 --> 01:39:21,917
''There's a stream of
nectar flowing in the eyes.''

1295
01:39:22,252 --> 01:39:25,517
''l am craving for
my beloved's kiss.''

1296
01:39:26,223 --> 01:39:33,129
''l am shaking. l am quaking.''

1297
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:39,962
''Am l the reason behind it?
lt's none other than you.''

1298
01:39:46,977 --> 01:39:48,877
Stop. Go through Patel road.

1299
01:39:49,246 --> 01:39:51,544
Control room. CM's
convoy diverted to Patel Road.

1300
01:40:07,931 --> 01:40:10,297
Hello! - Greetings, madam. l am Kri
shna Murthy speaking.

1301
01:40:10,667 --> 01:40:13,033
What is it? - CM sir, is
going to Patel Road house.

1302
01:40:13,303 --> 01:40:16,170
He might stay there. l
just wanted to inform you.

1303
01:40:16,273 --> 01:40:18,070
Ok.

1304
01:40:38,328 --> 01:40:40,262
What are you staring at?

1305
01:40:42,966 --> 01:40:45,264
l am the same person. l
haven't changed at all.

1306
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:48,998
You've changed a lot this year.
- Like what?

1307
01:40:49,973 --> 01:40:51,804
Your walk. Your behavior.

1308
01:40:52,843 --> 01:40:56,176
Your conduct. Now there are
men holding guns around you.

1309
01:40:56,913 --> 01:40:57,937
Everything's changed.

1310
01:40:59,716 --> 01:41:01,274
There's also a change in
your affection towards me.

1311
01:41:02,653 --> 01:41:03,779
You are not the old poet anymore.

1312
01:41:05,222 --> 01:41:08,089
l studied in a small
school in a small village.

1313
01:41:08,859 --> 01:41:10,952
But today l am the chief
minister of this state.

1314
01:41:11,662 --> 01:41:14,290
l have no idea about finance.
l have no idea about education.

1315
01:41:14,798 --> 01:41:17,631
l don't know law and order.
But l am in the first position..

1316
01:41:17,734 --> 01:41:20,202
..among all the chief
ministers of this state till now.

1317
01:41:20,303 --> 01:41:22,635
Turn around.
- You can ask the lAS officers..

1318
01:41:22,739 --> 01:41:26,140
..who are working under me,
about this chief minister.

1319
01:41:26,743 --> 01:41:28,040
Then why is there so
much worry in your heart?

1320
01:41:29,746 --> 01:41:31,145
Worry? W.O.R.R.Y.

1321
01:41:32,315 --> 01:41:34,215
You are not in a position
to understand my worries.

1322
01:41:35,185 --> 01:41:36,311
Manikyam is far better.

1323
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:39,318
That's why no one
wants an educated wife.

1324
01:41:40,157 --> 01:41:41,647
Why do you get upset, poet?

1325
01:41:46,296 --> 01:41:47,957
l am with you
every beautiful moment.

1326
01:41:50,333 --> 01:41:54,030
These are the moments l
won't forget even on my deathbed.

1327
01:41:56,173 --> 01:42:02,339
Every moment..
- No, l want the old poet.

1328
01:42:05,849 --> 01:42:06,873
Do not change.

1329
01:42:11,154 --> 01:42:12,178
You won't change, will you?

1330
01:42:21,331 --> 01:42:22,355
You didn't tell me about Pushpa.

1331
01:42:22,466 --> 01:42:25,094
Didn't l tell you not to
ask me about Pushpa? - Fine.

1332
01:42:27,437 --> 01:42:29,132
CM and you are best friends?

1333
01:42:31,007 --> 01:42:32,235
How much do you like the CM?

1334
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:34,934
Samara Suryam?

1335
01:42:36,947 --> 01:42:37,971
How much you don't like him?

1336
01:42:40,851 --> 01:42:42,148
Did l ask you
something l don't know?

1337
01:42:42,953 --> 01:42:46,252
You left Pushpa and
entered politics now?

1338
01:42:49,159 --> 01:42:50,786
Don't you want to be a CM?

1339
01:42:52,362 --> 01:42:54,796
Anyone in your position
would have wanted to be a CM.

1340
01:42:54,898 --> 01:42:55,922
Be careful.

1341
01:42:56,867 --> 01:42:58,164
Both of you are best friends, right?

1342
01:42:58,335 --> 01:43:00,462
Both are equal, aren't you?

1343
01:43:01,404 --> 01:43:02,871
Then who is greater than the other?

1344
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,865
Why are you getting into politics?
- Why shouldn't l?

1345
01:43:05,976 --> 01:43:07,341
Who brought you up
in this way, ma'am?

1346
01:43:08,111 --> 01:43:10,136
l don't have mother and father.
l don't have siblings.

1347
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:13,278
l grew up on my own,
like the trees and the bees.

1348
01:43:14,384 --> 01:43:15,942
Kalpana, be careful. What's this!

1349
01:43:16,052 --> 01:43:19,078
Call me Pushpa, or else l
will jump from the jeep.

1350
01:43:19,823 --> 01:43:21,757
Are you mad or what?
- Call me Pushpa..

1351
01:43:21,858 --> 01:43:22,882
..or else l will jump from the jeep.

1352
01:43:23,460 --> 01:43:24,484
Ok, jump.

1353
01:43:27,230 --> 01:43:28,254
Kalpana.

1354
01:43:39,976 --> 01:43:41,000
Kalpana.

1355
01:43:44,881 --> 01:43:45,905
Get up.

1356
01:43:47,884 --> 01:43:50,079
Are you ok?
- l am not hurt.

1357
01:43:58,895 --> 01:43:59,919
l am not hurt.

1358
01:44:01,565 --> 01:44:02,896
l am alive.

1359
01:44:08,071 --> 01:44:10,437
What's this?
- Nothing.

1360
01:44:11,875 --> 01:44:15,936
Why did you make that mark?
- Just for fun. l'll wipe it out.

1361
01:44:16,046 --> 01:44:18,241
Let it be there. Let it be there.

1362
01:44:19,249 --> 01:44:23,481
''And then the heart was lost.''

1363
01:44:24,187 --> 01:44:28,351
''The flowers blossomed in silence.''

1364
01:44:29,125 --> 01:44:33,960
''The breeze blew in the
same direction.'' - Come.

1365
01:44:46,476 --> 01:44:49,877
This is what l was scared of?
- Of what?

1366
01:44:53,516 --> 01:44:55,211
l was afraid that
something like this would happen.

1367
01:44:55,919 --> 01:44:56,943
What?

1368
01:44:59,022 --> 01:45:01,855
Don't talk anymore. Let's go.

1369
01:45:01,958 --> 01:45:08,864
''At the time when river
Godavari bats eyelid..''

1370
01:45:08,965 --> 01:45:10,865
Come, let's go.

1371
01:45:10,967 --> 01:45:17,998
''..when my love bows
down in front of him.''

1372
01:45:54,344 --> 01:45:56,175
Won't you go? The
meeting is about to start.

1373
01:45:57,147 --> 01:45:58,580
They said it would
start at 6 O' clock.

1374
01:46:00,417 --> 01:46:03,181
Who is going to talk first?
When will Suryam talk?

1375
01:46:03,286 --> 01:46:04,981
The chief minister will talk later,
after Mr. Bhargav Rao..

1376
01:46:05,088 --> 01:46:06,919
lt might take another hour or so.

1377
01:46:07,557 --> 01:46:09,991
lt would've been
better if went there now.

1378
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:12,951
lt's enough if l go there
when Suryam talks. - Alright.

1379
01:46:15,031 --> 01:46:16,328
Are you going late intentionally?

1380
01:46:21,204 --> 01:46:22,262
Why are you going late?

1381
01:46:24,307 --> 01:46:27,276
lt's alright. l understood it.
l understood it pretty well.

1382
01:46:30,146 --> 01:46:33,343
Will you take me there? l
want to meet your friend.

1383
01:46:34,317 --> 01:46:39,949
Our government is flying high
on the shoulders on the youth.

1384
01:46:42,058 --> 01:46:44,219
We must be proud of this moment.

1385
01:46:45,495 --> 01:46:47,053
We have many other
objectives to achieve..

1386
01:46:47,998 --> 01:46:49,431
We have to wipe out
the tears of the poor.

1387
01:46:50,734 --> 01:46:54,033
To uplift the downtrodden..

1388
01:46:54,137 --> 01:46:57,971
..the measures that
we need to take are..

1389
01:47:30,106 --> 01:47:31,130
l'll take care of that.

1390
01:47:35,345 --> 01:47:36,607
Mr. Anand came to meet you.

1391
01:47:39,549 --> 01:47:42,143
Anand?
- He will wait. You carry on.

1392
01:47:43,319 --> 01:47:44,343
Chandram.

1393
01:47:45,488 --> 01:47:46,512
Ok, then..

1394
01:47:49,359 --> 01:47:50,383
Greetings, sir.

1395
01:47:50,660 --> 01:47:53,094
He's Mr. Parandhamayya.
- How are you?

1396
01:47:53,196 --> 01:47:54,220
Fine.

1397
01:47:58,201 --> 01:47:59,225
Come in.

1398
01:48:00,603 --> 01:48:02,366
He is..
- l know him. l know him.

1399
01:48:03,339 --> 01:48:04,363
Greetings.
- Greetings.

1400
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:09,137
What's the matter he
came here all of a sudden?

1401
01:48:09,412 --> 01:48:11,403
ls it some party issue?
- Do not panic.

1402
01:48:11,514 --> 01:48:13,573
You will know it
when right time comes.

1403
01:48:14,751 --> 01:48:16,719
l heard, that you are about
to distribute the ministries.

1404
01:48:18,721 --> 01:48:22,350
Who told you that?
- Suryam, l want medicine ministry.

1405
01:48:23,293 --> 01:48:25,056
Health ministry.
- Prakasham sir told me..

1406
01:48:25,161 --> 01:48:27,186
..to accept the ministry.

1407
01:48:31,234 --> 01:48:34,465
Suryam, you think l
don't deserve a ministry?

1408
01:48:36,706 --> 01:48:38,367
No one else did what
you did for this party.

1409
01:48:39,175 --> 01:48:44,772
When this issue came
up l proposed your name.

1410
01:48:46,816 --> 01:48:49,080
But the working committee says..

1411
01:48:49,185 --> 01:48:54,122
..in order to get a ministry you
have to bid goodbye to acting.

1412
01:48:54,424 --> 01:48:57,587
l tried to convince them,
but they didn't listen to me.

1413
01:48:58,461 --> 01:49:00,224
So Suryam won't give me a ministry.

1414
01:49:03,700 --> 01:49:06,100
Anand, if you quit acting..

1415
01:49:06,202 --> 01:49:11,162
..you would get the
ministry you want tomorrow itself.

1416
01:49:11,274 --> 01:49:12,298
What?

1417
01:49:14,410 --> 01:49:15,672
The ministry you want is yours.

1418
01:49:29,225 --> 01:49:32,854
l think he did it intentionally.
- He became jealous.

1419
01:49:33,763 --> 01:49:35,458
You made him the chief minister.

1420
01:49:35,798 --> 01:49:37,629
Now he is showing
us his real nature.

1421
01:49:38,401 --> 01:49:40,130
That day when people ran
towards you in Mahanadu..

1422
01:49:40,236 --> 01:49:42,329
..his expression change
at that moment itself.

1423
01:49:42,872 --> 01:49:45,136
Even he can't deny, that
he became chief minister..

1424
01:49:45,241 --> 01:49:47,801
..because of you. How
can he forget it now?

1425
01:49:49,245 --> 01:49:50,269
l knew this would
happen a long time back.

1426
01:49:50,446 --> 01:49:52,744
You treat him as
your friend, but he..

1427
01:49:54,384 --> 01:49:56,147
We shouldn't let an
ungrateful person stay in power.

1428
01:49:56,252 --> 01:49:57,276
Stop the car.

1429
01:50:03,259 --> 01:50:04,886
Get down. Get down!

1430
01:50:06,296 --> 01:50:08,161
Don't you know anything
better than creating rifts..

1431
01:50:08,264 --> 01:50:10,164
..between two people? lf
you say one more word..

1432
01:50:10,266 --> 01:50:12,166
..against the CM, l will
forget that you belong..

1433
01:50:12,268 --> 01:50:13,360
..to our party and l will kick you.

1434
01:50:13,469 --> 01:50:14,629
Go by foot. Go.

1435
01:50:31,287 --> 01:50:32,311
You may go now.

1436
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:47,201
ls she sleeping?
- Did you say you won't give..

1437
01:50:47,303 --> 01:50:51,831
..a ministry to Anand?
- lt's not my decision.

1438
01:50:52,642 --> 01:50:53,666
lt's working committee's decision.

1439
01:50:54,477 --> 01:50:55,535
You are lying.

1440
01:51:00,283 --> 01:51:03,775
lndu, he is an actor.
He is an entertainer.

1441
01:51:04,587 --> 01:51:06,612
You want me to give a
ministry to an entertainer?

1442
01:51:07,323 --> 01:51:09,223
So you want to say
everyone who got ministries now..

1443
01:51:09,325 --> 01:51:10,349
..are intellectuals?

1444
01:51:15,732 --> 01:51:18,758
You are a teacher. You
teach hundreds of kids.

1445
01:51:19,769 --> 01:51:20,793
You want me to give
the throne to someone..

1446
01:51:20,903 --> 01:51:21,927
..who puts greasepaint on his face?

1447
01:51:22,605 --> 01:51:23,697
Shall l make him trade
and commerce minister?

1448
01:51:23,806 --> 01:51:24,830
Or shall l make him health minister?

1449
01:51:28,344 --> 01:51:29,902
Shall l tell you what l think?

1450
01:51:31,914 --> 01:51:35,315
You are afraid that he
might compete with you.

1451
01:51:36,386 --> 01:51:40,254
You are afraid because
the masses love him..

1452
01:51:40,356 --> 01:51:43,257
..the MLAs respect him, so
you fear that he might..

1453
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:45,327
..dethrone you.
- Anand?

1454
01:51:46,596 --> 01:51:47,620
CM?

1455
01:51:53,369 --> 01:51:54,461
What will happen to the party then?

1456
01:51:54,904 --> 01:51:59,466
lt's not about the party,
it's about our selfish reasons..

1457
01:51:59,575 --> 01:52:00,599
Yes, it's selfishness.

1458
01:52:01,644 --> 01:52:02,668
l too have greed.

1459
01:52:03,913 --> 01:52:06,609
l have the greed to become
the best CM of this state.

1460
01:52:07,784 --> 01:52:11,481
ln future people should
look at me as the model CM.

1461
01:52:11,988 --> 01:52:13,012
ls it that big a mistake?

1462
01:52:40,049 --> 01:52:42,711
ls there any honesty left?
ls there any eligibility?

1463
01:52:42,952 --> 01:52:44,886
We want an answer from the CM.

1464
01:52:45,755 --> 01:52:47,313
The opposition party's
leader is asking me..

1465
01:52:47,423 --> 01:52:48,447
..if there is any honesty left?

1466
01:52:49,759 --> 01:52:52,660
A one rupee coin has two sides,
like this assembly hall.

1467
01:52:54,030 --> 01:52:56,828
One on side there's head, and
on the other side there's tail.

1468
01:52:58,434 --> 01:53:01,995
lf there is head without
tail it can't be a coin.

1469
01:53:04,006 --> 01:53:05,337
lf there is the same
face on both the sides..

1470
01:53:05,441 --> 01:53:07,341
..that coin won't be accepted.

1471
01:53:08,611 --> 01:53:12,342
To bring down the government..

1472
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:16,384
..don't make baseless accusations.

1473
01:53:17,387 --> 01:53:20,515
Chief minister is trying to
hide the truth with his argument..

1474
01:53:20,623 --> 01:53:22,557
He is trying to save the
minister who took the loan.

1475
01:53:22,658 --> 01:53:24,489
We are not going to
accept your explanation.

1476
01:53:24,861 --> 01:53:26,089
You have to take action against him.

1477
01:54:16,446 --> 01:54:18,414
You are a revolution-conch.

1478
01:54:18,514 --> 01:54:20,414
An inspiration for all of us.

1479
01:54:20,716 --> 01:54:22,980
You breathe life
into others' ambitions.

1480
01:54:24,620 --> 01:54:26,781
The evil fate
snatched you away from us.

1481
01:54:28,090 --> 01:54:30,422
Those who treated you
as a father-figure..

1482
01:54:30,526 --> 01:54:32,926
..have become orphans today.

1483
01:54:34,030 --> 01:54:36,498
Our hearts are
weeping in your memory.

1484
01:54:46,542 --> 01:54:47,873
l am not about to say poetry.

1485
01:54:50,146 --> 01:54:52,512
l don't want to shed a
couple of tears and leave.

1486
01:54:53,883 --> 01:54:55,783
l want answers of a few questions.

1487
01:54:57,620 --> 01:55:00,145
Why did he leave us in
this way like orphans?

1488
01:55:20,643 --> 01:55:22,133
Even the party workers thought..

1489
01:55:22,245 --> 01:55:24,110
..that they did the right
thing by casting us their votes.

1490
01:55:24,847 --> 01:55:26,815
ls this the government
they were looking for?

1491
01:55:27,984 --> 01:55:29,008
A mistake has happened.

1492
01:55:30,186 --> 01:55:31,983
Corruption crept into us.

1493
01:55:33,189 --> 01:55:34,486
With the greed of the position..

1494
01:55:34,590 --> 01:55:36,490
..have we forgotten our objectives?

1495
01:55:39,529 --> 01:55:42,930
For our selfish reasons are
we misusing our position..

1496
01:55:53,276 --> 01:55:54,834
Today what we lost is not just him..

1497
01:55:55,711 --> 01:55:56,939
..but we lost our objectives.

1498
01:55:57,146 --> 01:55:58,238
We forgot the truth.

1499
01:55:59,549 --> 01:56:00,607
For the peace of his soul..

1500
01:56:02,585 --> 01:56:07,887
..just a couple of
tears won't be sufficient.

1501
01:56:08,758 --> 01:56:10,521
We need to prove our honesty
and integrity to the people..

1502
01:56:10,626 --> 01:56:12,526
..all over again. Those
who are holding positions..

1503
01:56:12,628 --> 01:56:14,926
..should ask themselves
some serious questions.

1504
01:56:20,036 --> 01:56:22,869
The party's fund accounts
should be shown to the public.

1505
01:56:24,974 --> 01:56:29,035
Only then can we regain our
party personnel's confidence.

1506
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,612
And only then will
his soul rest in peace.

1507
01:56:34,717 --> 01:56:37,151
He hasn't left us.

1508
01:56:38,154 --> 01:56:40,554
He will always be
there in our hearts.

1509
01:56:42,058 --> 01:56:44,117
Let's observe silence
for a minute in his memory.

1510
01:56:45,828 --> 01:56:47,989
Let's pray for his peace.

1511
01:57:21,130 --> 01:57:22,154
Go.

1512
01:57:30,006 --> 01:57:31,132
Read this one as well.

1513
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:32,830
Read it. Read it.

1514
01:57:33,876 --> 01:57:36,868
You call him your brother.
Read what he said about us.

1515
01:57:37,980 --> 01:57:39,004
Read it.

1516
01:57:42,652 --> 01:57:44,620
Yesterday again Anand
talked against our party..

1517
01:57:44,720 --> 01:57:46,620
..to the journalists in Ellore.
- He is upset that our..

1518
01:57:46,722 --> 01:57:49,691
..government is not running as
per his whims and his fans' wishes.

1519
01:57:49,792 --> 01:57:51,623
He is saying
whatever he want to say..

1520
01:57:51,727 --> 01:57:53,024
..because of the
fan following he has.

1521
01:57:53,362 --> 01:57:54,624
He feels that no
matter whatever he says..

1522
01:57:54,730 --> 01:57:57,790
..there is no one in the
party who could say him anything.

1523
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:00,164
He thinks he is greater than
the chief minister of the party.

1524
01:58:02,238 --> 01:58:03,967
The working committee is
waiting for your decision.

1525
01:58:06,175 --> 01:58:07,836
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings.

1526
01:58:09,078 --> 01:58:10,375
What's the decision of
the working committee?

1527
01:58:10,813 --> 01:58:13,281
Only after hearing your opinion,
we would take a decision.

1528
01:58:13,382 --> 01:58:14,644
Some of our party members
think that Anand should be..

1529
01:58:14,750 --> 01:58:16,650
..dismissed from the party,
but others think that..

1530
01:58:16,752 --> 01:58:19,016
..if such a step is
taken the party will spilt.

1531
01:58:29,932 --> 01:58:32,332
There's some important
news l need to tell him.

1532
01:58:43,813 --> 01:58:45,747
They are saying that you
are dismissed from the party.

1533
01:58:46,782 --> 01:58:48,682
Who told you so?
- Our men came from..

1534
01:58:48,784 --> 01:58:49,808
..the working committee meeting.

1535
01:58:52,188 --> 01:58:53,815
We don't know if it's
temporary or permanent.

1536
01:59:56,118 --> 01:59:57,745
We came to know that
you were suspended..

1537
01:59:57,853 --> 01:59:59,946
..from the party. - l too
came to know about it just now.

1538
02:00:00,055 --> 02:00:04,754
lt can't happen. We don't
accept it. We don't accept it.

1539
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:07,158
lf it's true l can't be happier.

1540
02:00:08,898 --> 02:00:10,763
Did you ever think that
such a thing would happen?

1541
02:00:10,866 --> 02:00:12,060
What do you want to say about it?

1542
02:00:13,035 --> 02:00:15,435
Today is one of the
happiest days of my life.

1543
02:00:20,176 --> 02:00:21,234
Sir. Sir, one more question.

1544
02:00:21,477 --> 02:00:22,910
What is the meaning
of this suspension?

1545
02:00:23,078 --> 02:00:24,375
Freedom. Freedom.

1546
02:00:24,480 --> 02:00:27,916
Freedom. Freedom. Freedom.

1547
02:00:30,419 --> 02:00:32,046
What do you want to do now?

1548
02:00:32,254 --> 02:00:34,222
First of all l want to
offer you payasam(a dessert).

1549
02:00:41,497 --> 02:00:42,930
Long live Anand!

1550
02:00:43,032 --> 02:00:44,795
Long live Anand!

1551
02:00:44,900 --> 02:00:46,800
Long live Anand!

1552
02:00:46,902 --> 02:00:48,802
Long live Anand!

1553
02:00:48,904 --> 02:00:50,804
Long live Anand!

1554
02:00:50,906 --> 02:00:54,808
Long live Anand! Long live Anand!

1555
02:01:08,157 --> 02:01:09,419
Anand's movie is about to release.

1556
02:01:10,192 --> 02:01:11,318
There's a message against us in it.

1557
02:01:12,528 --> 02:01:15,497
Shall we stop the release? -
Whose reputation will be hampered..

1558
02:01:15,598 --> 02:01:18,965
..if you do that? Theirs or ours?
- lt would hamper our reputation.

1559
02:01:19,235 --> 02:01:21,362
Then what's the need
to stop it? Leave them.

1560
02:01:22,104 --> 02:01:25,835
No, sir. He is misleading
the common man with his movies.

1561
02:01:26,175 --> 02:01:27,199
So..

1562
02:01:31,380 --> 02:01:32,847
Our party has weakened so much..

1563
02:01:32,948 --> 02:01:34,916
..that it can't even stand
against a three-hour movie?

1564
02:01:38,954 --> 02:01:39,978
Leave them.

1565
02:01:43,225 --> 02:01:45,523
''Freedom.''

1566
02:01:45,961 --> 02:01:48,452

l am sorry to give you this news.

1628
02:06:59,797 --> 02:07:02,197
The central government
has banned our government.

1629
02:07:03,067 --> 02:07:05,535
This is the government of the
people. People's government.

1630
02:07:05,636 --> 02:07:08,605
There is no place
for democracy in this.

1631
02:07:08,706 --> 02:07:11,539
Those who were with us,
those who supported us..

1632
02:07:11,642 --> 02:07:15,544
..have stabbed us in our
back and went to the centre..

1633
02:07:15,646 --> 02:07:18,615
..to bring us down.
lt's very shameful.

1634

Long live Anand!

1638
02:07:45,610 --> 02:07:46,702
We were eagerly waiting for you.

, ,

1640
02:08:42,333 --> 02:08:45,700
ls my question wrong?
- No.

1641
02:08:46,737 --> 02:08:48,637
They can expel me from the party..

1642
02:08:48,739 --> 02:08:50,832
..but can they expel
me from your hearts?

1643
02:08:51,108 --> 02:08:54,635
No, they can't. They can't.

1644
02:08:58,683 --> 02:09:02,050
We are leading in
Pailavaram by 8000 votes.

1645
02:09:02,153 --> 02:09:03,643
We are getting a positive response..

1646
02:09:03,754 --> 02:09:04,778
..from other places as well.

1647
02:09:05,156 --> 02:09:06,851
We are leading in Warrangal as well.

1648
02:09:11,228 --> 02:09:12,252
ln Enukondalu as well..

1649
02:09:26,444 --> 02:09:29,140
l came here after voting for
the first time ever in my life.

1650
02:09:31,782 --> 02:09:33,682
With the anger l have
for you, l should've gone..

1651
02:09:33,784 --> 02:09:36,218
..far away from you, or l
should've committed suicide.

1652
02:09:38,322 --> 02:09:39,755
But l cast my vote and came here.

1653
02:09:40,725 --> 02:09:41,749
l cast my vote for you.

1654
02:09:43,127 --> 02:09:45,891
l know why you
didn't come to the temple.

1655
02:09:48,432 --> 02:09:50,992
You said it in a weak
moment that you would marry me.

1656
02:09:51,902 --> 02:09:54,132
Then you decided against it
after thinking about it, right?

1657
02:09:54,305 --> 02:09:57,206
Kalpana. - Don't give me
a honey-coated excuse.

1658
02:09:57,808 --> 02:09:58,832
l won't believe you.

1659
02:10:01,812 --> 02:10:03,712
Your close aides
must have advised you.

1660
02:10:04,448 --> 02:10:05,710
That you launched a new party..

1661
02:10:05,816 --> 02:10:07,784
..that the elections are nearing..

1662
02:10:07,885 --> 02:10:11,719
lf you become a CM, it
would be detrimental for you..

1663
02:10:11,822 --> 02:10:13,915
..if you have a second wife.

1664
02:10:14,825 --> 02:10:17,726
That's why you called me here,
called me to the train..

1665
02:10:17,828 --> 02:10:20,388
..and made me wait and fooled me.

1666
02:10:22,033 --> 02:10:23,728
Did you abandon me
because you didn't like me..

1667
02:10:23,834 --> 02:10:26,359
..or because someone said something?

1668
02:10:27,471 --> 02:10:28,802
What are your advisors telling you?

1669
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:31,740
Do not marry her. lf you
wish you can make her..

1670
02:10:31,842 --> 02:10:34,777
..your mistress. Yes, visit
her place whenever you wish.

1671
02:10:37,014 --> 02:10:38,208
Did they say that?

1672
02:10:38,849 --> 02:10:41,249
You could've let me die. But
why are you torturing me..

1673
02:10:41,352 --> 02:10:42,910
..in this way?

1674
02:10:49,960 --> 02:10:50,984
You want to touch me?

1675
02:10:51,395 --> 02:10:54,421
Touch me, but do not marry me.

1676
02:10:57,268 --> 02:10:59,327
Leave me. l will go.

1677
02:10:59,937 --> 02:11:01,837
l will leave both
cinema and politics.

1678
02:11:02,540 --> 02:11:03,871
l will go away from you.

1679
02:11:11,148 --> 02:11:12,843
Even if tears flow like a sea..

1680
02:11:14,485 --> 02:11:15,884
Even if tears flow like a sea..

1681
02:11:17,288 --> 02:11:21,247
..those who die never return.
- ..those who die..

1682
02:11:21,358 --> 02:11:26,125
..those who die..
- ..never.. - ..return.

1683
02:11:27,898 --> 02:11:29,229
..never return.

1684
02:11:30,167 --> 02:11:31,191
What happened? Come in.

1685
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:36,029
We are leading at 62 places.
- And he?

1686
02:11:36,307 --> 02:11:39,970
Leading at 158 places.
There's a recounting at 4 places.

1687
02:11:54,058 --> 02:11:55,082
No.

1688
02:11:57,862 --> 02:12:02,299
No. We are leading at 62 places.

1689
02:12:03,467 --> 02:12:04,491
And he is leading in 158 places.

1690
02:12:06,003 --> 02:12:07,027
There's recounting at 4 places.

1691
02:12:09,940 --> 02:12:14,036
We don't want shortcuts.. l
am relieved of this burden.

1692
02:12:16,447 --> 02:12:17,846
l am proud of our daughter..

1693
02:12:17,948 --> 02:12:20,439
..and happy to see my wife.

1694
02:12:23,220 --> 02:12:26,849
What we are destined to get..
Let that Anand wear..

1695
02:12:26,957 --> 02:12:29,858
..that crown of thorns.
We are opposition.

1696
02:12:31,262 --> 02:12:32,422
You won't leave Anand even now?

1697
02:12:35,499 --> 02:12:36,557
Now l'm the one who
will question him.

1698
02:12:38,335 --> 02:12:40,929
And that actor will have
to answer me. Anandam!

1699
02:12:43,140 --> 02:12:45,938
..will be ours sooner or later.

1700
02:12:46,377 --> 02:12:50,404
..will be..
- ..ours sooner or later.

1701
02:12:50,514 --> 02:12:52,539
..ours sooner or later.

1702
02:12:53,584 --> 02:12:57,384
l..
- l, Anandam..

1703
02:12:57,488 --> 02:12:59,888
..do solemnly affirm that l will
bear true faith and allegiance..

1704
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:02,481
..to the constitution of lndia
as by the law and established.

1705
02:13:03,994 --> 02:13:06,895
..do solemnly affirm that l will
bear true faith and allegiance..

1706
02:13:06,997 --> 02:13:09,966
..to the constitution of lndia
as by the law and established.

1707
02:13:10,067 --> 02:13:11,898
..that l will
uphold the sovereignty..

1708
02:13:12,002 --> 02:13:13,026
..and integrity of lndia.

1709
02:13:15,005 --> 02:13:16,905
..that l will
uphold the sovereignty..

1710
02:13:17,007 --> 02:13:18,975
..and integrity of lndia.

1711
02:13:19,076 --> 02:13:20,907
..that l will
faithfully and consciously..

1712
02:13:21,011 --> 02:13:22,911
..discharge my duties
as the chief minister..

1713
02:13:23,013 --> 02:13:24,037
..of the state of Andhra Pradesh.

1714
02:13:29,019 --> 02:13:30,919
..that l will
faithfully and consciously..

1715
02:13:31,021 --> 02:13:32,921
..discharge my duties
as the chief minister..

1716
02:13:33,023 --> 02:13:35,389
..of the state of Andhra Pradesh.

1717
02:13:35,492 --> 02:13:38,518
..and that l do..

1718
02:13:39,129 --> 02:13:42,292
Whenever l open my eyes
you are in front of me.

1719
02:13:43,267 --> 02:13:44,291
And then?

1720
02:13:46,036 --> 02:13:49,403
l closed my eyes and
you became my dream.

1721
02:13:50,975 --> 02:13:53,341
You say it..
- You say it, mother. - Me?

1722
02:13:56,580 --> 02:14:00,107
That breeze will come again.

1723
02:14:01,085 --> 02:14:02,950
But l haven't closed my eyes.

1724
02:14:03,387 --> 02:14:04,479
What if that breeze comes today?

1725
02:14:05,589 --> 02:14:09,525
O heart, l am helpless..
- Wait a minute. l'll say it now.

1726
02:14:10,060 --> 02:14:11,652
For you..
- Greetings, sir.

1727
02:14:12,429 --> 02:14:13,589
We got the report of
the Gupta commission.

1728
02:14:18,135 --> 02:14:19,500
This is enough to
bring down the government.

1729
02:14:20,004 --> 02:14:21,164
We will attach wings to this.

1730
02:14:31,048 --> 02:14:32,447
What happened to
the Gupta commission?

1731
02:14:32,549 --> 02:14:34,244
What happened to it?
- What happened to it?

1732
02:14:34,351 --> 02:14:35,511
Calm down. Calm down.

1733
02:14:36,420 --> 02:14:37,978
l request all the members to
follow the basic decorum..

1734
02:14:38,088 --> 02:14:40,147
..of the assembly.

1735
02:14:40,257 --> 02:14:42,987
Has judge Gupta
completed his enquiry..

1736
02:14:43,093 --> 02:14:46,995
..and presented the
report to the government?

1737
02:14:47,097 --> 02:14:49,998
Honorable speaker, its
enquiry is still going on..

1738
02:14:50,100 --> 02:14:52,660
..due to the
complexities of the case.

1739
02:14:59,476 --> 02:15:00,500
Commission report.

1740
02:15:02,112 --> 02:15:05,513
Will the CM read it?
Will the deputy CM read it?

1741
02:15:06,483 --> 02:15:08,007
Or do you want me to read it?

1742
02:15:10,521 --> 02:15:13,012
Honorable speaker, a
government secret..

1743
02:15:13,123 --> 02:15:16,024
..that too a report whose
enquiry is still going on..

1744
02:15:16,126 --> 02:15:19,527
Stealing and exposing such
a report is against law.

1745
02:15:20,264 --> 02:15:22,232
lt's against the law.
- lt's against the law.

1746
02:15:22,333 --> 02:15:25,029
lf exposing the
corruption in the ruling party..

1747
02:15:25,135 --> 02:15:28,696
..is against law, then l will
go against law a hundred times.

1748
02:15:28,806 --> 02:15:31,104
We will do it hundred times.

1749
02:15:31,208 --> 02:15:33,642
Long live home minister!

1750
02:15:33,744 --> 02:15:35,109
Long live home minister!

1751
02:15:35,212 --> 02:15:36,372
Long live home minister!

1752
02:15:36,480 --> 02:15:38,038
Long live home minister!

1753
02:15:38,148 --> 02:15:39,513
Long live home minister!

1754
02:15:39,616 --> 02:15:43,108
Long live home minister!

1755
02:16:02,473 --> 02:16:05,135
The Home minister is safe, but
the other delegates got injures.

1756
02:16:07,678 --> 02:16:09,077
When prime minister comes tomorrow..

1757
02:16:09,179 --> 02:16:11,773
..he will visit the city
with Mr. Samar Suryam.

1758
02:16:12,816 --> 02:16:16,081
Put section 1 44.
- lf it turns against you..

1759
02:16:18,255 --> 02:16:21,088
lf it turns against me
arrest Samara Suryam..

1760
02:16:21,191 --> 02:16:24,524
..and put him in the jail.
- lf we arrest him..

1761
02:16:25,195 --> 02:16:26,219
lf we arrest him?

1762
02:16:48,218 --> 02:16:50,686
Sir, we are sorry to..

1763
02:17:02,499 --> 02:17:05,127
lt's you?
- We thought that there would be..

1764
02:17:05,235 --> 02:17:08,204
..an uproar in the state.

1765
02:17:09,840 --> 02:17:12,502
To tell you the
truth it's your victory.

1766
02:17:12,609 --> 02:17:13,633
What do you call victory?

1767
02:17:17,347 --> 02:17:22,307
Getting an old friend
of mine into the jail?

1768
02:17:22,419 --> 02:17:23,613
That's not what l meant.

1769
02:17:25,355 --> 02:17:27,653
Did you have dinner? Come.
- No, thanks.

1770
02:17:27,758 --> 02:17:28,782
lt's ok. Come.

1771
02:17:46,810 --> 02:17:48,334
Why did you send your resignation?

1772
02:17:49,580 --> 02:17:51,480
l need to tell you something
as a member of this party.

1773
02:17:51,648 --> 02:17:53,343
Tell me what it is. Did
l say l won't hear you?

1774
02:17:53,884 --> 02:17:57,479
Last week they offered me half a
million for just one sign of mine.

1775
02:17:57,921 --> 02:18:00,185
lf l am being offered half a million
or 100 million for a billion project..

1776
02:18:00,290 --> 02:18:03,191
..how much money would've
gone to how many ministers..

1777
02:18:03,293 --> 02:18:05,261
..from the 78 billions budget.
- You are right.

1778
02:18:05,529 --> 02:18:08,930
People have immense love,
respect and faith in you.

1779
02:18:09,366 --> 02:18:11,197
At least for the
sake of that faith..

1780
02:18:11,301 --> 02:18:13,201
..our party members should be
a bit honest, shouldn't they?

1781
02:18:13,303 --> 02:18:15,271
That's the reason people
like you are in this party.

1782
02:18:17,975 --> 02:18:19,272
Just one person is not sufficient.

1783
02:18:19,710 --> 02:18:22,201
lt is not right to overlook a
fault when it is happening..

1784
02:18:22,312 --> 02:18:25,213
..right in front of us. ls
this why people handed us over..

1785
02:18:25,315 --> 02:18:27,215
..the reigns to run this state?
- Did you ask this question..

1786
02:18:27,317 --> 02:18:29,683
..when Mr. Samara Suryam was the CM?

1787
02:18:30,621 --> 02:18:32,213
Why are you giving me
the resignation letter..

1788
02:18:32,322 --> 02:18:34,256
..that you didn't give him?

1789
02:18:34,958 --> 02:18:36,823
You left that party because of
the corruption that crept in.

1790
02:18:37,294 --> 02:18:39,922
And that's the reason l left
that party and came with you.

1791
02:18:40,664 --> 02:18:42,256
You said that the previous
government robbed this state.

1792
02:18:42,599 --> 02:18:44,362
That it swallowed
every single rupee.

1793
02:18:46,670 --> 02:18:48,797
What do you think is happening here?

1794
02:18:49,473 --> 02:18:51,907
The condition is far worse here.

1795
02:18:54,011 --> 02:18:58,948
Did you add yourself or did
you add me in this corruption?

1796
02:18:59,783 --> 02:19:00,807
What l meant was..

1797
02:19:03,353 --> 02:19:04,752
Long live Anand!

1798
02:19:04,855 --> 02:19:06,254
Long live Anand!

1799
02:19:06,356 --> 02:19:08,654
Long live Anand!

1800
02:19:08,759 --> 02:19:11,523
My beloved leader's beloved people.

1801
02:19:15,966 --> 02:19:18,264
On our leader's birth anniversary..

1802
02:19:18,368 --> 02:19:24,273
..as you wanted, as we
wished from today onwards..

1803
02:19:24,374 --> 02:19:30,609
..all the poor will
get rice at a low price.

1804
02:19:35,652 --> 02:19:39,281
The first one kilo
rice will be received by..

1805
02:19:39,389 --> 02:19:41,380
..health minister Mr. Bhargav Rao.

1806
02:19:43,994 --> 02:19:45,484
Long live our leader Samara Suryam!

1807
02:19:45,596 --> 02:19:47,461
Long live our leader Samara Suryam!

1808
02:19:47,564 --> 02:19:49,657
Long live our leader Samara Suryam!

1809
02:19:55,939 --> 02:19:57,964
Hail our leader Samara Suryam!

1810
02:19:58,075 --> 02:19:59,975
Hail our leader Samara Suryam!

1811
02:20:11,755 --> 02:20:16,317
My life is ruined. My
life is completely ruined.

1812
02:20:16,593 --> 02:21:17,247
, ,

1813
02:21:18,088 --> 02:21:19,112
Sir..

1814
02:21:19,423 --> 02:21:20,583
Hey! Go slow.

1815
02:21:38,108 --> 02:21:39,132
Mr. Sambayya!

1816
02:21:42,446 --> 02:21:43,606
Kalpana is here.

1817
02:21:44,614 --> 02:21:46,411
Bring Kalpana back home.

1818
02:21:50,053 --> 02:21:53,887
Mr. Sambayya, don't
come home without Kalpana.

1819
02:21:54,591 --> 02:21:55,615
Come, let's go.

1820
02:22:15,078 --> 02:22:17,546
l could see that smile back
on his face after so long.

1821
02:22:17,981 --> 02:22:19,448
He must've definitely
taken some decision..

1822
02:22:23,954 --> 02:22:25,922
..or else he wouldn't
have called you there.

1823
02:22:27,758 --> 02:22:31,455
l think he would give
you a high position. lt's..

1824
02:22:31,561 --> 02:22:33,995
Do not praise me unnecessarily.
- No, actually..

1825
02:22:50,213 --> 02:22:51,475
There's a talk that these days
CM is not giving interviews..

1826
02:22:51,581 --> 02:22:53,481
..to the press.
- People have handed me ..

1827
02:22:53,583 --> 02:22:55,483
..a great responsibility.
- For the government..

1828
02:22:55,585 --> 02:22:58,213
..press is like a mirror,
isn't it, sir?

1829
02:22:59,022 --> 02:23:00,489
For an actor the audience's claps..

1830
02:23:00,590 --> 02:23:04,959
..and for a politician
people's votes are the true mirrors.

1831
02:23:05,195 --> 02:23:07,891
And we?
- You are magnifying glasses.

1832
02:23:08,865 --> 02:23:10,992
You make everything look large.

1833
02:23:11,601 --> 02:23:13,501
Ok, sir, we won't enlarge
them. We will write them..

1834
02:23:13,603 --> 02:23:15,503
..as you say. What is
your comment on the scams..

1835
02:23:15,605 --> 02:23:18,005
..that took place
under your ministry?

1836
02:23:18,108 --> 02:23:20,508
Did you ever expect the
party to split into two pieces..

1837
02:23:20,610 --> 02:23:23,101
..in this way? What do you
think is the reason for this?

1838
02:23:23,213 --> 02:23:25,044
On Araku road the cat met with an..
- Who?

1839
02:23:25,549 --> 02:23:27,949
Mr. Sambayya was in it.
- Who?

1840
02:23:28,685 --> 02:23:31,882
We got Mr. Sambayya's body.
- Kalpana?

1841
02:23:32,722 --> 02:23:33,848
We are searching, we will get it.

1842
02:23:47,070 --> 02:23:49,800
The meet is over.
- Sir, but..

1843
02:24:00,217 --> 02:24:01,980
You can see him
later on. Leave him now.

1844
02:24:24,875 --> 02:24:29,073
There can't be a
happier day in our lives.

1845
02:24:29,880 --> 02:24:31,575
The CM is attending the wedding.

1846
02:24:31,681 --> 02:24:34,081
Shall we inform you before he comes?

1847
02:24:34,184 --> 02:24:35,708
You go and take care of your CM.

1848
02:24:35,819 --> 02:24:36,911
l will take care of myself.

1849
02:24:39,122 --> 02:24:41,590
A the time when it
wasn't understood..

1850
02:24:41,691 --> 02:24:45,923
..that wedding is the union
of two persons, two hearts..

1851
02:24:46,630 --> 02:24:49,599
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

1852
02:24:49,699 --> 02:24:52,600
Greetings, sir.
- Greetings, sir.

1853
02:25:09,719 --> 02:25:10,743
Greetings.

1854
02:25:11,655 --> 02:25:16,888
The ex-CM, the present

..you have left me alone?

1896
02:33:18,274 --> 02:33:22,108
The day before yesterday,
when we were..

1897
02:33:22,211 --> 02:33:25,112
..on the threshold of youth..

1898
02:33:25,214 --> 02:33:29,617
..we ate on the same leave,
we slept on the same carpet..

1899
02:33:33,289 --> 02:33:37,726
..the tears of those memories
are overflowing in the heart.

1900
02:33:47,170 --> 02:33:50,765
Our eyes are different,
but our dreams are the same.

1901
02:33:52,909 --> 02:33:56,310
Our hearts are different,
but our conscience is the same.

1902
02:33:58,314 --> 02:34:01,841
Our paths are different, but
our destination is the same.

1903
02:34:05,321 --> 02:34:07,755
You always wanted to
be one step ahead of me.

1904
02:34:09,725 --> 02:34:12,751
ls that why you left
me behind even in death?

1905
02:34:23,873 --> 02:34:25,170
Where are those hands that
put the victory garland..

1906
02:34:25,274 --> 02:34:26,298
..around my neck?

1907
02:34:29,579 --> 02:34:31,706
Where are those fingers
which wiped away my tears?

1908
02:34:35,751 --> 02:34:37,184
Where is that voice of the cuckoo..

1909
02:34:37,286 --> 02:34:38,685
..that sounds like a new flute?

1910
02:34:41,791 --> 02:34:44,419
Where are those lips that
uttered those beautiful words?

1911
02:34:47,396 --> 02:34:50,854
Where are those shoulders
that carried me that day?

1912
02:34:58,741 --> 02:35:00,368
Can't l see you again, my friend?

1913
02:35:08,918 --> 02:35:10,909
There is not even a bit
of hatred in my mind now.

1914
02:35:12,855 --> 02:35:15,483
There is not even a
drop of enmity now.

1915
02:35:17,927 --> 02:35:21,556
ls death the only way
to sanctify the heart?

1916
02:35:36,779 --> 02:35:41,409
l wanted to tell you something,
but l couldn't.

1917
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:47,617
When l saw you tired, l
wanted to ask you how you are.

02:35:49,358 --> 02:35:50,382
But l couldn't.

1919
02:35:52,361 --> 02:35:57,389
Today l wanted to kiss
your lotus-like face.

1920
02:35:58,935 --> 02:35:59,959
But l couldn't.

1921
02:36:02,471 --> 02:36:04,837

1922
02:36:06,642 --> 02:36:07,666
..but l couldn't.

1923
02:36:09,478 --> 02:36:10,604

Set a place beside you for me.

1926
02:36:22,391 --> 02:36:25,554
Sooner or later l will come
to the place where you went.

1927
02:36:38,040 --> 02:36:42,306
lf l see another dawn..

1928
02:36:42,411 --> 02:36:48,316
..if l am handed over
the reigns of nature..

1929
02:36:48,417 --> 02:36:54,788
..l will fulfill your
ambition and my mine, my friend.

1930
02:36:57,526 --> 02:37:02,020
