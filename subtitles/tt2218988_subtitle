1
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:07,516
Faizi's story had started
even before he was born.

2
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:56,532
Is it?

3
00:02:58,945 --> 00:02:59,969
Praise to God!

4
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:05,413
At Iast I have got a son.

5
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,118
He wiII be a handsome guy.

6
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,048
I wiII christen him as FaizaI.

7
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:13,756
I wiII caII him Faizi.

8
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,466
He wiII inherit aII the weaIth I make.

9
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:28,138
That's why I said Faizi's story had
started Iong before he was born.

10
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:47,756
In those 9 months AbduI Razak
bought everything for Fareeda.

11
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:51,456
She had been so
dear to him those days.

12
00:03:56,369 --> 00:04:00,271
At Iast that Iong awaited day came.

13
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:13,011
GirI chiId!

14
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:24,058
She was named Fathima.

15
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,667
They started preparing
forthe next baby so that...

16
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,168
...AbduI Razak wanted
Faizi at the earIiest.

17
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,667
Thus Fareeda gave
birth to another baby.

18
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:41,205
Don't cry.

19
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,020
Boy or girI?
- GirI!

20
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:58,530
She was named Fousia.

21
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:03,135
Fareeda reached the
Iabor room next year aIso.

22
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:07,000
GirI chiId!

23
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:08,132
God!

24
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,071
Her name was Firoza.

25
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:22,821
The foIIowing year
same pIace, same time.

26
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,523
God! Give me a son this time.

27
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:39,601
GirI!

28
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:48,107
Her name was Fazeeha.

29
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,080
With the expansion of famiIy, AbduI
Razak's business aIso expanded.

30
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,687
Fareeda became pregnant
again after two years.

31
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,662
But this time, AbduI Razak
set off to Dubai...

32
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:08,825
...by the time, Fareeda was to deIiver.

33
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,273
Is here any reIative of Fareeda?

34
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:18,774
They are asking for Fareeda's reIatives.

35
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,675
Boy or girI?
- Boy.

36
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:22,872
Praise to God! Boy chiId!

37
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,515
God answered the caII.

38
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,042
Aren't you Abdu?

39
00:06:51,811 --> 00:06:52,937
Praise to God!

40
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:57,346
When I was thinking that aII are
part of a dream, my Faizi came.

41
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,047
Praise to God!

42
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:04,851
Fareeda's heaIth faiIed
because of continues deIiveries.

43
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,458
She passed away.

44
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:23,369
Faizi's mother Ieft him with a father...

45
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:28,573
...who has never seen
him, and 4 young sisters.

46
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:39,782
Don't cry.

47
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:40,311
Have it.

48
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:41,811
Have it.

49
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:48,389
Like that.

50
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,195
That day Faizi tasted
sweet forthe first time.

51
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:16,782
''USTHAD HOTEL''

52
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:26,460
AbduI Razak took his chiIdren
to Dubai after Fareeda's death.

53
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:32,696
Come.

54
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,666
Like that...

55
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:44,411
His sisters brought him
up where there is no mother.

56
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:54,024
He grew up in their worId,
dreams and in that kitchen.

57
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,626
They tried their IeveI best to
compensate for his mother's affection.

58
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:10,641
They cooked for him the same
dishes that their mother used to prepare.

59
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,945
But he soon took over the kitchen.

60
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:21,543
He made the kitchen
chores an entertaining affair.

61
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:25,284
But his father didn't Iike that.

62
00:10:25,825 --> 00:10:29,852
What have you to do in
the kitchen? Come here.

63
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:34,866
Go to study.

64
00:10:43,876 --> 00:10:46,276
Thus Faizi became a young man.

65
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,428
By the time his daughters
reached marriageabIe age,...

66
00:11:37,596 --> 00:11:40,429
...AbduI Razak found out
grooms forthem in Dubai itseIf.

67
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:08,925
At Iast, Faizi became
IoneIy in that big house.

68
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,812
This is your new mother.

69
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,031
Take a Iook at these.

70
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,237
Read them carefuIIy.

71
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,238
Then, you can decide
where to join for MBA.

72
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:33,002
I have pIans to enter some
new business fieIds aIong with you.

73
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,176
Read.

74
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:10,141
Have you taken a decision? UK or US?

75
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:11,681
I went through aII those.

76
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,282
What's the point in going to UK
or US forjust another ordinary MBA.

77
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:20,714
OnIy if I do something different,
it wiII be usefuI for your business.

78
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,549
- Yes.

79
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,456
There is a good course in SwitzerIand.

80
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,692
In a hoteI management institute.

81
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:27,924
I wouId Iike to join there.

82
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,292
Now a days tourism is
a highIy sought after area.

83
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:33,837
Tourism..hoteI management...not bad.

84
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:37,301
Can we start a five star
hoteI if you do such courses?

85
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,238
Ofcourse.

86
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:40,305
We have to move aIong with
the changing times, right? - Yes.

87
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:41,504
EIse what is the use?

88
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:43,213
We have to think a IittIe bit differentIy.

89
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:44,816
What you said is right.

90
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:49,384
Moreover, others shouId foIIow
AbduI Razak and not vice versa.

91
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,350
I agree.

92
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,717
When you return, we can
start a five star hoteI of our own.

93
00:14:56,428 --> 00:15:00,262
PeopIe once caIIed me the son of
a cook. Now my son shouId make...

94
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,199
...the same peopIe address me
as the owner of a five star hoteI.

95
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:04,927
Ok?

96
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,689
Things are going to be worse.

97
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,993
After finishing his course in SwitzerIand
Faizi has found a job in London.

98
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:53,764
He and his girIfriend pIan
to buy a house in London.

99
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,464
What's wrong with him?

100
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:58,777
Didn't he get a fairer girI?

101
00:17:58,911 --> 00:17:59,570
Listen.

102
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,008
Do you know his present demand?

103
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:06,082
We shouId teII fatherthat
he won't be returning home.

104
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,811
My God once father comes to
know this, he wiII be finished.

105
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,185
If we go to teII this, we wiII be finished.

106
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,824
Don't frighten us.

107
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,392
Try to find a pIan to
overcome the situation.

108
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:35,275
We shouId bring him back
without Ietting father know anything.

109
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:56,631
WiII there is any probIem for him to
come to our home directIy from airport?

110
00:18:56,735 --> 00:18:59,863
No way. My son won't disobey me.

111
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,530
Not onIy that.

112
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:06,403
Before others in my own famiIy come
up with a proposaI, we have to fix this.

113
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,139
Any famiIy wiII wish to
have FaizaI as their groom.

114
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,977
From a weaIthy famiIy,
education from abroad...

115
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:14,915
and as handsome as Mammootty.

116
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,930
Faizi...

117
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,533
Son...

118
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:41,204
Father, greetings. - Greetings.

119
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,208
What an appearance is this!

120
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,974
This is KaIIummathodiyiI Hajiyar.

121
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,984
He wiII be an important person
for you in the future. - Greetings.

122
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:56,718
Hi...

123
00:19:59,231 --> 00:19:59,993
Sorry.

124
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:01,758
Come.

125
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,325
You come with AbduIIah by that car.
- Okay father.

126
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:09,599
AbdhuIIahkka... - Yes?

127
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:12,642
Who are these peopIe? - They've
come with a marriage proposaI for you

128
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:13,476
What?

129
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:15,170
Yes. Get in.

130
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:26,884
Some are waiting to taIk to you.

131
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,830
Ethathas(sisters) and company!

132
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,666
Groom! Are you going to see
the bride without informing us?

133
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:40,795
So, you are behind this, right?

134
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:44,864
Haven't I toId you about Christina?
Then, why shouId you unnecessariIy...

135
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:49,438
We know aII such things.
But there is no harm in just meeting her.

136
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,377
Give me that.

137
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:53,812
Don't agree to the reIationship aII of a
sudden....it's not good for our status.

138
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,385
That won't happen.

139
00:20:55,854 --> 00:20:58,220
Is it for this that you aII wanted
me to come home immediateIy?

140
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,018
If I knew it before, I wouId
have brought her with me.

141
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,927
Don't make troubIe.

142
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:07,359
We were reIieved onIy when AbduIIah
uncIe toId us there is no one with you.

143
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,056
She wiII be coming in the next fIight.

144
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:13,630
HeIIo...

145
00:21:14,072 --> 00:21:14,766
HeIIo...

146
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,169
HeIIo...

147
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:17,202
HeIIo...

148
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:18,638
I wasjust kidding.

149
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:21,376
She has gone to Spain
to spend her hoIidays.

150
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:24,307
OurfIat in London wiII
be ready within 10 days.

151
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,317
By that time, both of
us shouId reach there.

152
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:30,012
Faizi...Why didn't you find
a better Iooking woman?

153
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,690
This is Iike a trans-gender..

154
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,870
Greetings... - Greetings...

155
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:51,839
Come in son.

156
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:56,905
Greetings... - Greetings...
- How was thejourney. - It was good.

157
00:22:07,392 --> 00:22:08,256
Shahana...

158
00:22:18,136 --> 00:22:19,125
Come Razak.

159
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:22,399
You sit there.

160
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,739
Go son.

161
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:25,236
Come and sit son.

162
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:26,240
You sit there.

163
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:27,908
You sit.

164
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,277
You sit.

165
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:42,160
Is the Iife abroad as comfortabIe
as our Iife in our home Iand, FaisaI?

166
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,487
It's comfortabIe.

167
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,026
But we won't get these snacks there.

168
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,534
The times have changed.

169
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:53,934
If they want, FaizaI and
Shahana can taIk to each other.

170
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,404
Go.

171
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:19,224
Hai...

172
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,157
I am FaizaI.

173
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,964
Shahana.

174
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,035
I don't know what they have toId you.

175
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,139
ActuaIIy I'm not prepared for this.

176
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:34,245
How sweet?

177
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,540
Yes, it is cute romantic but...

178
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:39,314
I asked about the
amount of sugar in yourtea?

179
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:44,380
Two pIease.

180
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,393
My famiIy is highIy orthodox.

181
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:54,991
But I am not.

182
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:59,167
When we were aIIowed to
taIk, I thought the opposite.

183
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,498
Do you know why we were
asked to sit here and taIk?

184
00:24:04,075 --> 00:24:05,542
Not to disturb us.

185
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:09,713
This is one spot in this house where one
can be seen from aII the four directions.

186
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,712
If you Iook up there wiII be my
grandpa, grandma and uncIe.

187
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:20,685
In the Ieft my eIder sister, her
husband, their chiIdren, aII wiII be there.

188
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,130
My God... Go fast.

189
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,236
AII are waiting for a chance to put a trap.

190
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,577
But they can't hear us.

191
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:46,111
Thanks.

192
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,114
What made you opt for
an arranged marriage?

193
00:24:51,423 --> 00:24:52,651
A handsome man Iike you.........

194
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:54,022
Good Iooking...

195
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,483
Educated abroad...

196
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,958
You must be having
a European girI friend.

197
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,567
Why have you decided in
favor of an arranged marriage?

198
00:25:05,237 --> 00:25:08,070
If I had the freedom to choose,
I wouId not marry anyone.

199
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,072
But, I toId you.

200
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,841
My famiIy is orthodox.
- Okay!

201
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,371
If I ever get married,
I need an equaI partner.

202
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,111
A person who can
accommodate my views aIso.

203
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,446
Your eIder sisters toId me that
you wouId be one Iike that.

204
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,049
How do they know?

205
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:29,960
First one sister came.

206
00:25:30,061 --> 00:25:30,755
To see me.

207
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:33,631
Then she came with others.

208
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,865
This is the third round of bride seeing.

209
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,299
Oh! Great!

210
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,434
I shouId of guess!

211
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,765
But none of these toId me about you.

212
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,974
Oh! No probIem. I wiII teII.

213
00:25:45,176 --> 00:25:46,905
I am 21 years oId.

214
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:48,377
My education was in BangaIore.

215
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,372
SpeciaIized in interior designing.

216
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,982
After marriage aIso, I want
to continue with my work.

217
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,679
I can't remain at home
Iooking after the chiIdren.

218
00:25:57,923 --> 00:25:58,582
Ofcourse.

219
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:03,718
I wouId Iike to do the interior
work of yourfive star hoteI.

220
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:07,427
I don't think that it wiII ever happen.

221
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:11,062
Do you have any probIem
in me doing that work? - No.

222
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,137
I'm not going to run that hoteI.

223
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:16,136
Is it not your project?

224
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,035
It is not my project, but my father's.

225
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:22,269
There is one thing that
my father doesn't know.

226
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:27,414
I was trained as a chef in SwitzerIand.

227
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,217
Chef?.

228
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:31,214
- Yes.

229
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:36,049
Chef means...one who cooks food...

230
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,384
White cap...

231
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:39,855
You are right.

232
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,525
There is a five starjoint in London.

233
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:45,062
The IV restaurant.

234
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:48,171
I have got the position of a sous chef.

235
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,900
I wiII be join in a week.

236
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:50,803
Excuse-me.

237
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:08,384
We were Iooking for a groom
for her and not a cook, right?

238
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:10,893
Didn't I teII you?

239
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:12,486
They became rich very recentIy.

240
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,095
They are not a good match for us.

241
00:27:14,232 --> 00:27:15,927
Ours is a different pedigree.

242
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,898
TheirfamiIy members are mainIy cooks.

243
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:19,931
Start the car.

244
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,480
What happened?
- Let's go fast.

245
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,017
Your father is reaIIy angry.

246
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:49,099
You have been squandering my money
in SwitzerIand aII these 3 years, right?

247
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,926
How dare you do that?

248
00:27:51,202 --> 00:27:51,759
Father...

249
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:55,928
Didn't I teII you that I wanted
to do a different MBA?

250
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,998
Different? What different?

251
00:27:59,244 --> 00:28:02,077
From chiIdhood I have been
ridicuIed as cook Koya's son Abdu.

252
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,180
I have worked hard to erase that tag.

253
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,775
Now I have a status.

254
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,911
That time here comes one with a
different styIe of cooking business.

255
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:11,984
Didn't you find anything eIse to do?

256
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:15,425
How did you dare Iie to me?

257
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,419
Idiot!

258
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,154
You come to the point.

259
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,096
Are you angry because I Iied to you
or because I'm working as a chef?.

260
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,526
Job of chef?.

261
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:24,233
I won't aIIow you to do that.

262
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,830
I won't Iet you go into troubIes.

263
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:30,535
I wiII buiId a five star hoteI
in the property of Hajjyar.

264
00:28:30,675 --> 00:28:31,767
You wiII run it.

265
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,400
And you wiII marry Hajiyar's daughter.

266
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:36,714
PIease excuse me from
your business caIcuIations.

267
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:37,975
To excuse?

268
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:41,877
Then why did I send you abroad and
spent a Iot of Euro to educate you.

269
00:28:42,353 --> 00:28:44,981
Without making the most of
that, I won't Iet you go anywhere.

270
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:46,484
I wiII return your money.

271
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,181
Return?

272
00:28:48,827 --> 00:28:50,920
Idiot! Give it back.

273
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:52,422
Give back my money.

274
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,232
Give my money now itseIf.

275
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,326
Stop it dramatic father.

276
00:28:59,604 --> 00:29:01,094
I have got a good job in London.

277
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:03,265
I wiII send your money
once I get my saIary.

278
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,643
You can't give me back a singIe penny.

279
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,507
Your education and styIe
are because of my money.

280
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,777
Your Iuxurious Iife with my credit card!

281
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:18,714
I wiII stop that today.

282
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,357
Let's see what you have
without these things.

283
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,461
If I had my mother, you wouId
not have taIked to me Iike this.

284
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,293
Your mother had aIways
been a stumbIing bIock for me.

285
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,168
I was happy when she gave you.

286
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,233
But now onIy I reaIized the fact.

287
00:29:47,552 --> 00:29:48,211
Faizi...

288
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:50,179
Faizi...

289
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:53,848
I wiII give you time tiII tomorrow morning.

290
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,127
If you want to become a
cook Iike your grandfather...

291
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,592
...then you won't have
space for you in this house.

292
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:01,921
I'm very serious.

293
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,594
You can take your own decision.

294
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:06,331
Faizi...

295
00:32:06,357 --> 00:32:07,984
Did you think weII before
taking this decision?

296
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,827
- Yes.

297
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:14,523
There is a Iife I wished.
I can't give that up.

298
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:38,418
If there is ever a heaven on earth,
it is here...it is here...it is here...

299
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:49,295
''GIorious is God...
GIorious is God...GIorious is God''

300
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:55,671
''GIorious is God...
GIorious is God...GIorious is God''

301
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:26,734
''GIorious is God...
GIorious is God...GIorious is God''

302
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,039
''GIorious is God...GIorious is God...''

303
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,006
Kareem ikka...
''GIorious is God''

304
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:39,178
''GIorious is God...
GIorious is God...GIorious is God''

305
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,753
''GIorious is God...GIorious is God...''

306
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,653
''GIorious is God''
Have you come to Iive with me?

307
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:47,783
- No.

308
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,993
OnIy tiII my sisters manage
to get back my passport...

309
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:54,962
...and other documents from my father.

310
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,333
OnIy for a few days.

311
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,235
WiII your sisters do it for you?

312
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:02,670
I have onIy them to speak for me.

313
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,770
That's right.

314
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:09,308
They must teII it to make
their onIy brother spineIess.

315
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,875
He has Iearned how to cook from books.

316
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,187
Let him experience some taste, right?

317
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:24,052
Son...

318
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,120
Keep this.

319
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,259
You have to be cautious.

320
00:34:28,766 --> 00:34:30,563
Your grandfather is
a very pecuIiar person.

321
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:31,930
He is not Iike your father.

322
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,763
Not Iike my father!
Thank God!

323
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:38,169
Even your father has
not understood Karim ikka.

324
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:39,865
Keep that in mind.

325
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:43,202
Thanks AduIIah uncIe.

326
00:35:01,732 --> 00:35:06,499

336
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:51,536
Ummar...
- Yes.

337
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,505
Introduce him to aII here.
- Okay.

338
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:58,973
Greetings.

339
00:36:59,083 --> 00:36:59,640
Come

340
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:02,809
This is FaizaI.

341
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,180
Grand chiId of ustad

342
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,785
He has just come from America.

343
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,118
Give him a cup of hot tea.
- I wiII give right now.

344
00:37:09,327 --> 00:37:11,352
ActuaIIy not America, but Europe.

345
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:12,688
Both are same.

346
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:14,594
Be it America or Europe, for us those
are on the other side of this sea.

347
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,530
Get me one more cup of coffee.

348
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,735
Don't spoiI that waII.

349
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,098
He thinks that he is
another M F Hussain.

350
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,204
Did you understand who this is?
- No.

351
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:29,301
Grand chiId of ustad.

352
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,710
Does Ustad have chiIdren?

353
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:31,906
I hear it for the first time.

354
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,777
You idiot..there are so many things
in this worId unknown to you.

355
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,588
ustad is a IittIe reserved,
especiaIIy in famiIy matters.

356
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:39,988
I'm quite the opposite.

357
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:42,458
I have two wives and nine chiIdren.

358
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,058
4 in the first and 5 in the second.

359
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,788
And one is one the way.

360
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:48,756
Ummer ikka...Take this.

361
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,389
Don't go away.

362
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,101
We have four waiters.

363
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,327
This is Johnny

364
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,435
Hi!
- Greetings.

365
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:56,502
Those are Babu and Sabu

366
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:57,841
They are twins

367
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,506
One more is here- IsmaiI

368
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:00,601
He must be somewhere here.

369
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:01,905
There ..

370
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,415
Ummer ikka...Have you
introduced yourseIf?

371
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:06,878
No. You introduce me.

372
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:07,781
This is Ummar ikka.

373
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:09,376
He thinks that he is the
right hand of Karim ikka.

374
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,952
But even Karim ikka hasn't
understood his roIe here.

375
00:38:13,057 --> 00:38:17,494
Karim ikka has understood who
are eating from here for free.

376
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,921
Don't make me reveaI more secrets.

377
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,057
These four guys are neither
customers nor furniture here.

378
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:26,167
Sitting here continuousIy they
got themseIves fixed here.

379
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:27,702
Like some fungi.

380
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,035
Not Iike any fungi, but Iike oysters.

381
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,363
Hi!
- Hi!

382
00:38:31,609 --> 00:38:32,541
We are 'KaIIumekkayas'.

383
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,634
That is the name of our band.
- Oh! You guys are part of a band!

384
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:36,303
- Yep
- What kind of music?

385
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,214
LocaI foIk, Arabic, AIternative Rock..
That sort of thing you know.

386
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:44,182
Nice! - What they said is right, but the
truth is no one has heard them singing.

387
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,412
Keep mum.

388
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,854
Don't you know that we have got
a show in the RGC next week?

389
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,026
Come to watch that.

390
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,554
You wiII see our reaI face there.

391
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,062
Leave me aIone..I'm fed up
with what I have seen so far.

392
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:55,797
Dude, I Iike your hair.

393
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:57,262
Thanks.

394
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:13,574
What's up?

395
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,115
What do you think?

396
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:22,781
Thatjeans cIad kitten might run away.

397
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,994
But if it stays, he wiII rock.

398
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:40,407
Christina..some crazy things
have happened here in India.

399
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:43,106
Need to taIk to you soon.

400
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:50,286
You caII me on +919847345676.

401
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,415
I miss you Iike crazy.

402
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,188
Love you Iots.

403
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,492
Kisses..Faizi.

404
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,995
Faizi ikka...Karim ikka is caIIing you.

405
00:40:02,266 --> 00:40:03,130
Okay.

406
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,229
Bye baby.

407
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:10,831
Take this.

408
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:12,871
Start the vehicIe.

409
00:40:29,226 --> 00:40:31,592
I don't have Iicense to drive here.

410
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:32,854
You need not worry about that.

411
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,430
Our vehicIe doesn't
have registration either.

412
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:35,590
Yes.

413
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:43,833
What's the matter?

414
00:40:44,375 --> 00:40:46,138
I was reciting some hoIy scriptures.

415
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,038
Go...go.

416
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:17,836
Grand father knows Hindi aIso!

417
00:41:21,745 --> 00:41:23,906
Hindi, tamiI, Kannada, Punjabi...

418
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:26,005
Karim brother knows aImost
aII the Indian Ianguages.

419
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,109
Does he know EngIish?

420
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,513
Is EngIish an Indian Ianguage?

421
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,381
If your grandpa contests
in an eIection from here...

422
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,426
These auto drivers aIone
can vote him to victory.

423
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:37,653
That is our market.

424
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:38,654
How?

425
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,864
If a new person comes to Kozhicode...

426
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:44,833
...he wiII want to eat a
biriyani before returning.

427
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:47,464
Once getting into an auto from
the bus stand or raiIway station...

428
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,539
They wiII inquire these drivers about the
joint where they wiII get good biriyani.

429
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:52,302
These drivers wiII take them
directIy to our ustad hoteI.

430
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,808
They wiII teII their
friends and reIatives...

431
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:58,006
...back home about
the taste of our biriyani.

432
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,143
They are free to take them
to any hoteI here, right?

433
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:00,740
Yes they can.

434
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:05,820
But onIy ustad hoteI offers a biriyani free
for those who bring a new customer.

435
00:42:06,423 --> 00:42:07,014
Not bad.

436
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,050
He has the same business
sense of my father.

437
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:13,563
Karim ikka is much bigger than
yourfather in every fieId of activity.

438
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,923
He has traveIed extensiveIy
and has done aII sorts ofjobs.

439
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,900
But, he forgot to make
money when interest for...

440
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:20,766
...sociaI service went into this head.

441
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:21,895
Yes. Come, come.

442
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:27,634
This is my grandchiId.

443
00:42:27,745 --> 00:42:28,336
HeIIo.

444
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:31,110
Take these two bags to the van.

445
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:33,807
Lift it.

446
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:35,885
Me?
- Yes.

447
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,479
What's the matter?

448
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:39,320
These two bags.

449
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:43,617
Lift it.

450
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:44,453
Take.

451
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:53,535
Be carefuI. SIowIy.

452
00:42:58,375 --> 00:42:58,932
Here.

453
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:00,605
What's inside this?

454
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,409
Biriyani rice.

455
00:43:03,714 --> 00:43:06,615
Light, tender rice with a speciaI aroma.

456
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,087
Light, tender rice!

457
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,029
Sister..where had you been tiII now?

458
00:43:27,972 --> 00:43:31,931
It has not been even
24 hours after we caIIed you.

459
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,310
Do you know what aII happened
during these 24 hours?

460
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,541
Yes. AbduIIah uncIe toId us.

461
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:39,779
How is grandpa?

462
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,675
Did you caII to inquire about him or me?

463
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,253
Have we ever stood against your wish?

464
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,953
The way you seIected is the right path.

465
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:49,750
So, you don't want me
to return to my father?.

466
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,592
You shouId somehow
get my documents back.

467
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,454
I have to go back to London.

468
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:59,297
HeIIo...HeIIo...HeIIo...

469
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,495
We can hear.

470
00:44:00,738 --> 00:44:02,672
When are you going to
taIk this matter with father?.

471
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,238
How wiII we discuss
this matter with him?

472
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,636
Then, how wiII I go back?

473
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,543
This is my first day here.

474
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,973
He made me carry a rice
bag weighing 50 kg.

475
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:16,083
Is it not the same thing you do
in a gym after paying money?

476
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,118
Yourjokes are out of pIace now.

477
00:44:17,421 --> 00:44:18,285
Say seriousIy.

478
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,953
HeIIo...HeIIo...

479
00:44:22,793 --> 00:44:24,522
Can't beIieve these stupid phone.

480
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:40,073
Christina!

481
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,469
HeIIo.

482
00:44:41,545 --> 00:44:43,410
Christina...Christina...

483
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,388
Good morning.

485
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:34,256
''I'm aIso a traveIer..''

486
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,129

''You are a traveIer''

488
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,235
''I'm aIso a traveIer..''

489
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:51,774
Is this ajoint famiIy?

490
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,382
No..aII are mine onIy.

491
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,212
Is it?
- Yes.

492
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,908
''You are a traveIer''

493
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,006

''I'm aIso a traveIer..''

497
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,923
Cut the money from my saIary.

498
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:40,992
SaIary?

499
00:46:55,345 --> 00:46:57,404
He is not mature enough
to enterthe kitchen.

500
00:47:14,464 --> 00:47:15,192
Sorry.

501
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:21,834
No no..I wiII cut it from his saIary.

502
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:36,980
It wiII be much easier if you
computerize these account matters.

503
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:38,880
Ummer...

504
00:47:38,956 --> 00:47:39,980
Ummer ikka...
- Yes.

505
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:42,125
ExpIain today's business accounts.

00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:45,286
'86 porotta', 14 fish curry,
13 chicken curry, 28 chicken biriyani...

507
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,421
...3 mutton biriyani and 31 'suIaimani'.

508
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:57,367
I'm ready to suffer anything.

509
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,169
But grandpa doesn't aIIow me to cook.

510
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:04,608
I'm a professionaIIy quaIified chef, right?

511
00:48:26,603 --> 00:48:28,161

512

00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,261
''You are a traveIer''

523
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:36,362
''I'm aIso a traveIer..''

524
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:40,176
''In this journey''

525
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,456
Not bad.

526
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:55,220
Yes!

527
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,595
Son...Anyone can fiII anyone's stomach.

528
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,124
But those who eat shouId
be satisfied mentaIIy too.

529
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,459
That abiIity makes a great cook.

530
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:14,901
''Nothing strives''

531
00:50:17,714 --> 00:50:20,274
''To keep me up babe''

532
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,406
''Night''

533
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:28,289
''Trim away''

534
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:33,289
''To make you want to stand by''

535
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:41,296
''CIouds of sounds in the air...''
Very good!

536
00:50:51,615 --> 00:50:53,981
Is it for this that is sent you
to SwitzerIand for education?

537
00:50:59,122 --> 00:51:01,955
Have you understood what wiII happen
to you if you try to be Iike your grandpa?

538
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:05,054
Write carefuIIy!

539
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:07,825
Is it not a business with
the turnover of miIIions?

540
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:08,896
No need to incur Ioss.

541
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:16,696
Abdu...Let him choose his own
way just Iike you chose yours.

542
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:19,840
This is not a simpIe thing.

543
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:22,169
But the matter of a five star hoteI
in which biIIions are at stake.

544
00:51:22,612 --> 00:51:24,671
Why shouId you interfere in matters
which you are not aware of.

545
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,282
You too need not
interfere in this business.

546
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,008
You....

547
00:51:29,653 --> 00:51:30,119
Father...

548
00:51:32,456 --> 00:51:34,219
No one here is against my wishes.

549
00:51:34,357 --> 00:51:36,655
Is it your ambition to pick waste here?

550
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,552
WiII your ambitions tumbIe
down if you run a five star hoteI?

551
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:41,486
No one here forces me for anything.

552
00:51:42,666 --> 00:51:44,793
Isn't it training for me?

553
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,069
Training!

554
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:49,870
This shop is the most important
thing for your grandpa.

555
00:51:49,973 --> 00:51:51,838
Everything eIse is secondary for him.

556
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:52,533
Do you know that?

557
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:55,142
That I know better than
anyone eIse in this worId.

558
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,643
I can buy this whoIe shop
with a singIe cheque.

559
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:00,474
But I won't do that.

560
00:52:01,051 --> 00:52:02,780
I feeI suffocation the
moment I enter here.

561
00:52:03,253 --> 00:52:06,051
I feeI the same in your home.

562
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,786
Your grandpa must have
taught you so many things.

563
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:15,388
But you shouId remember one thing.

564
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:19,032
With phiIosophy aIone, one can't
achieve anything in this worId.

565
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,501
That he has proved with his own Iife.

566
00:52:24,007 --> 00:52:25,838
You are wasting your Iife Iike that.

567
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:31,204
If you feeI Iike changing your
ways, then you can come to me.

568
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:02,509
Why is my father Iike this?

569
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:07,408
It is because his father
didn't nurture him weII.

570
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,850
When he was a chiId,
I had been a nomad.

571
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,994
Learned so many things
from different pIaces.

572
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:22,362
But I couIdn't teach him those
things to him after my return.

573
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,128
His had a kind of grudge towards
me right from his chiIdhood.

574
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,730
When he grew up that grudge
aIso deveIoped with him.

575
00:53:30,574 --> 00:53:35,443
He hated me, this hoteI
and my principIes.

576
00:53:37,581 --> 00:53:39,173
What I did to him is wrong.

577
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,877
But I don't know how to correct it.

578
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:44,911
My father won't Iet you do that.

579
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:52,118
If you add potato to any ingredient in
any dish, it wiII retain it's unique taste.

580
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:53,788
Your father is Iike that.

581
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:58,326
Those who are with him
now don't reaIIy Iove him.

582
00:53:58,535 --> 00:54:00,332
They are after his money.

583
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,632
So he speaks the same Ianguage.

584
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:08,744
I can onIy pray for him.

585
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:14,383
AIong with that I beg
pardon to the AImighty.

586
00:54:22,058 --> 00:54:22,615
ShaII we go?

587
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:44,904
E-maiI from my London boss.

588
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:49,018
If I don'tjoin this week, he
wiII appoint someone eIse.

589
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:52,249
Why do you want to go back dude?

590
00:54:52,856 --> 00:54:54,346
It's a much better scene here, right?

591
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:57,619
Not my scene!

592
00:55:01,197 --> 00:55:03,529
You go and have food.

593
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:04,657
I wiII sit here.

594
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,130
WiII you Iike ajob in the Beach Bay?

595
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,239
In that five star hoteI?

596
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:12,235
I have to go back grandpa.

597
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:14,943
I am tensed whenever
I think about my passport.

598
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,940
AbduIIa uncIe says that it wiII take two
months to get a dupIicate passport.

599
00:55:19,082 --> 00:55:21,209
Don't you need ajob tiII then?

600
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,184
One thing that your father said is right.

601
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:27,314
If you want to Iearn something
new, you have to get out of here.

602
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:33,288
Go to Beach Bay, meet
Babu and give him this.

603
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,563
This is not enough to appIy for a job.

604
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:38,065
There are some officiaI
procedures for that.

605
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,328
- You go and give that.

606
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:44,964
How are you baby?

607
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:45,971
What wouId you Iike to have?

608
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:46,906
You are not crying?

609
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:47,767
Ummer ikka...

610
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,177
CouId you read this for me?

611
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:54,477
This is my grand chiId.

612
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:56,812
Give him a job that
he Iikes - Kareem ikka.

613
00:55:57,153 --> 00:55:59,485
Wow! That's officiaI.
- Try it.

614
00:55:59,622 --> 00:56:01,613
I don't think that this can't
be more officiaI than this.

615
00:56:18,341 --> 00:56:19,433
Excuse-me..
- Yes.

616
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,601
Can I meet Mr. Babu?

617
00:56:21,745 --> 00:56:24,509
Mr. Babu: the executive chef?.
- Executive...!

618
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:26,010
Yes. That's him.

619
00:56:26,149 --> 00:56:27,173
You have an appointment?

620
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,816
I have a message from Kareem ikka.

621
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,781
From Usthad hoteI.
- Oh! PIease come.

622
00:56:35,158 --> 00:56:35,988
Yes, young man!

623
00:56:37,761 --> 00:56:38,853
KindIy pIease to meet you sir!

624
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:40,256
He said there is a message.

625
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:40,987
Oh yes.

626
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:42,989
Here it is.

627
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:49,865
You are Karim ikka's
grandson, right? - Yes.

628
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,632
FaizaI AbduI Razaq.

629
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:56,642
My CV and certificates.

630
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,579
I am a graduate
from Iozan, SwitzerIand.

631
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:01,374
Very good.

632
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:03,717
You have got big quaIifications.

633
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:05,280
That aIso from SwitzerIand.

634
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:06,716
Very good.

635
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,318
I can't deny a request from Karim ikka.

636
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,994
Anyway, you can join tomorrow.

637
00:57:12,695 --> 00:57:13,252
Yeah!

638
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:14,688
Good Iuck.

639
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:16,593
Thank you sir.

640
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,036
My cycIe?

641
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:01,003
Wait tiII next month.
- Okay. I just reminded you.

642
00:58:04,047 --> 00:58:05,014
Aabida!

643
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:08,115
The groom's party is coming
forfixing the wedding.

644
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:09,809
Enough money for that is in it.

645
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,814
Why the five star chefs
are Iinger around here?

646
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:18,257
I'm Iearning your caIcuIations
without computer or caIcuIator.

647
00:58:19,229 --> 00:58:21,424
AII okay, grandpa?
- It's okay.

648
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,662
But I want to buy a cycIe for Johnny.

649
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,964
Nessu's chiId needs to
be admitted in a schooI.

650
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:27,536
Don't they get fixed saIaries?

651
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:28,834
That's right.

652
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:31,705
But more and more requirement
keeps on coming in Iife, right?

653
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:33,699
They Iive with their famiIies.

654
00:58:34,477 --> 00:58:36,445
This is yours.

655
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:40,376
This is to send money orderto Madurai.

656
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,286
This is to your grandpa's second wife.

657
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:45,249
Ummer....!

658
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,989
You send this every month.

659
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:49,681
But won't reveaI to whom it is being sent.

660
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,726
So, there is something fishy in it, right?

661
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:02,401
I derive more pIeasure from making
someone eat rather than eating.

662
00:59:02,972 --> 00:59:05,634
This is to share my
happiness in getting a job.

663
00:59:10,947 --> 00:59:11,504
Grandpa...

664
00:59:12,649 --> 00:59:13,980
What's the reason why I got this job?

665
00:59:14,851 --> 00:59:17,183
You have required
quaIifications, you are abIe.

666
00:59:17,353 --> 00:59:19,116
And moreover you are my grandchiId.

667
00:59:19,355 --> 00:59:20,720
The Iast said is the reaI reason.

668
00:59:21,658 --> 00:59:25,116
What is your connection
with that Chef Babu?

669
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:30,356
Have you had the speciaI
biriyani of Beach Bay hoteI?

670
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:31,658
No.

671
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,933
PeopIe order onIy five
star dishes there, right?

672
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:36,237
This is aIso a five star item.

673
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:44,609
Foreigners staying there often
prefer speciaI 'maIabari biriyani'.

674
00:59:45,648 --> 00:59:47,206
There is a secret recipe for that.

675
00:59:55,491 --> 00:59:56,253
That's it.

676
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,351
How do you know that?

677
01:00:02,231 --> 01:00:04,256
You use the recipe of Beach Bay, right?

678
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,595
You fooI!

679
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:08,463
Try to think it in the reverse order.

680
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:10,937
No way!

681
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,872
Is the 'biriyani' prepared here is served
as the speciaI maIabari biriyani there?

682
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,037
- Yes.

683
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,107
So, they get the fame and profit?

684
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:22,815
For every biriyani, Babu
wiII give me Rs.5 extra.

685
01:00:25,555 --> 01:00:27,648
That's why he became humbIe
when he heard your name.

686
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:28,921
Faizi...

687
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:31,490
There are a Iot more Ieft for you to Iearn.

688
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:56,785
These are our boys.

689
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:01,922
Chef PhiIipe has come over here
to conduct a fusion food festivaI.

690
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,352
He wiII be here with
us forthe next two weeks.

691
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:09,787
His speciaIty is a combination of
European dishes and our IocaI ones.

692
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,163
Fusion fissiIe!

693
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,729
Overto you Chef PhiIipe.

01:16:48,003 --> 01:16:51,530
Did you reaIize how
everything is easy for women?

859
01:17:00,082 --> 01:17:01,572
I can't endure it any Ionger.

860
01:17:02,551 --> 01:17:03,381
We wiII reach very soon.

861
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:25,866
My hand...

862
01:17:26,975 --> 01:17:28,408
Don't you guys have
mothers and sisters?

863
01:17:28,877 --> 01:17:31,209
Go...Shahana.

864
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:36,307
Go and catch them.
Faizi..Come.

865
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:37,382
Stop there.

866
01:17:37,853 --> 01:17:39,184
Stop there.
- Go away man.

867
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:42,120
Bag...

868
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:42,952
Faizi..bag.

869
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:00,133
Stop there.

870
01:20:51,146 --> 01:20:52,807
Don't you guys have
mothers and sisters?

871
01:20:58,153 --> 01:20:59,484
Super diaIogue deIivery!

872
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:03,323
Even after making me do
aII these things.....you Iaugh.

873
01:21:08,396 --> 01:21:09,226
You know something.

874
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,396
Today is the Iast day of my freedom.

875
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,432
Tomorrow is my betrothaI.

876
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:33,246
Congrats!

877
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:35,016
Thank you.

878
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:45,663
Don't you want to
know who the groom is?

879
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:50,968
I'm sure he won't be chef or a cook.

880
01:22:04,953 --> 01:22:05,749
Okay.

881
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:09,882
ShaII we go?

882
01:22:26,341 --> 01:22:27,069
Okay.

883
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:40,917
Bye.

884
01:22:41,323 --> 01:22:41,948
Bye.

885
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:45,250
Shahana...

886
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:49,394
Your performance was great today.

887
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:52,925
On stage or after that?

888
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:55,960
Both.

889
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:01,400
Good bye.

890
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:03,301
Bye.

891
01:25:27,922 --> 01:25:28,684
What dish is this?

892
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:29,682
This dish?

893
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:32,054
That's a speciaI one from
a viIIage - Kattakkada.

894
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:33,216
Kaattakaa...!

895
01:25:33,361 --> 01:25:34,726
No. Kattakkada.

896
01:25:35,096 --> 01:25:37,462
Kaatakaa...
- Kaattakaa..

897
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,394
Daa..
- Daa...

898
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:41,826
Have it.

899
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:56,107
Chef?.
- What's the matterAIex?

900
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:58,581
The guest in tabIe no 28
wants to meet the chef.

901
01:25:58,720 --> 01:25:59,379
Which is the dish?

902
01:26:01,656 --> 01:26:02,213
You go.

903
01:26:09,964 --> 01:26:10,487
Faizi...

904
01:26:14,836 --> 01:26:18,135
You have got good experience
in aII departments.

905
01:26:18,306 --> 01:26:21,605
But I haven't trained you in
a very important department.

906
01:26:22,644 --> 01:26:23,406
Customers.

907
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:25,009
But no probIem.

908
01:26:25,146 --> 01:26:26,010
That we can compensate.

909
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:30,249
The customer in tabIe 28 has
requested to meet the chef.

910
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:32,242
I give this opportunity to you.

911
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:33,115
Go and meet him.

912
01:26:33,354 --> 01:26:35,914
But, without knowing which
dish he has ordered......

913
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,185
In our kitchen, everything is a team work.

914
01:26:38,660 --> 01:26:42,960
If I couId take the credit of your dish,
you take the credit of oyster?

915
01:26:49,470 --> 01:26:50,630
Carry on.
- Thank you chef.

916
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:00,003
Sir...

917
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:00,773
May I heIp you.

918
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:01,972
Sure.

919
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:04,544
I wouId be pIeased if you couId
teII me what is in this pIate.

920
01:27:07,722 --> 01:27:09,519
Sir, that Oysters with KeraIa spices.

921
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,390
This is the star attraction
of ourfusion food festivaI.

922
01:27:12,827 --> 01:27:15,660
Our IocaI ingredients Iike pepper,
Iime and smaII onion are...

923
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:17,697
...served with a European
dish Iike oyster.

924
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:20,560
European styIe!

925
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:21,558
Yes sir.

926
01:27:23,605 --> 01:27:25,732
Do you know even
the speIIing of Europe?

927
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:28,433
Mehroof..pIease...

928
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,213
Don't create a scene unnecessariIy.

929
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:35,673
HeIIo.

930
01:27:36,017 --> 01:27:38,679
I ask this after ordering the most
expensive dish in the menu.

931
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,212
If this stuff is to be served raw,
there is no need of chef.

932
01:27:44,726 --> 01:27:47,820
In a fusion food menu generaIIy.......
- This is not fusion but confusion.

933
01:27:50,732 --> 01:27:51,926
Sir, pIease understand.

934
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:53,798
This dish is to be eaten Iike this.

935
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:55,799
So, it is not your mistake.

936
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:57,766
The probIem is with my ignorance.

937
01:27:58,840 --> 01:27:59,670
CaII your MD.

938
01:27:59,774 --> 01:28:00,706
I wiII taIk to him.

939
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:12,478
Sorry sir.

940
01:28:12,720 --> 01:28:14,984
If you order what you want..
chef wiII cook it for you.

941
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:16,920
But he wants to teach me how to eat.

942
01:28:17,191 --> 01:28:18,954
Not at aII...you pIace the order.

943
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:22,055
I ordered for oyster with KeraIa spices.

944
01:28:22,530 --> 01:28:24,725
First you cook it for me as I Iike it.

945
01:28:44,185 --> 01:28:44,742
Yes sir.

946
01:31:31,986 --> 01:31:33,510
Don't you go to work today?
- No.

947
01:31:33,955 --> 01:31:34,922
I'm on Ieave today.

948
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:39,722
Where are you off to?

949
01:31:40,528 --> 01:31:41,495
ShouId I drop you?

950
01:31:48,169 --> 01:31:48,931
Kareem ikka!

951
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:50,799
God!

952
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,931
FaizaI, my grand chiId.

953
01:31:55,209 --> 01:31:56,301
HeIIo.
- Hi!

954
01:31:57,478 --> 01:31:59,503
You know the deadIine of that Ioan.

955
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:01,578
OnIy some more months are Ieft.

956
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:06,083
I know it is difficuIt for you for a fuII
repayment incIuding the interest.

957
01:32:07,688 --> 01:32:08,848
How much does the totaI come to?

958
01:32:09,824 --> 01:32:12,691
Rs. 786043.

959
01:32:15,496 --> 01:32:17,862
Can you extend the
deadIine a IittIe further?

960
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:19,956
It is impossibIe.

961
01:32:20,401 --> 01:32:22,665
But there is a proposaI.

962
01:32:24,038 --> 01:32:25,437
You wiII onIy benefit from this.

963
01:32:26,073 --> 01:32:29,008
If you seII this mortgaged
property to us this month...

964
01:32:29,143 --> 01:32:32,408
...you wiII get another
50,000 rupees extra.

965
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:37,514
Any way you wiII Iose
the property in no time.

966
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:39,577
If I repay the Ioan, it won't happen.

967
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:46,718
Which is this property?

968
01:32:47,528 --> 01:32:49,189
I have onIy one property.

969
01:32:50,197 --> 01:32:51,994
HoteI?
- Yes.

970
01:32:54,602 --> 01:32:56,729
I have written down aII the caIcuIations.

971
01:32:57,038 --> 01:32:57,595
Take this.

972
01:33:01,242 --> 01:33:02,869
FaizaI...PIease come.

973
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:03,800
Sure.

974
01:33:09,550 --> 01:33:13,543
I see his efforts to pay
the interest every month.

975
01:33:14,355 --> 01:33:16,516
But stiII he is adamant.

976
01:33:17,058 --> 01:33:17,786
It's because of his oId age.

977
01:33:18,225 --> 01:33:20,318
You shouId expIain him the reaIities.

978
01:33:21,028 --> 01:33:23,223
What does he gain
from repaying this Ioan?

979
01:33:24,165 --> 01:33:27,566
This financiaI probIem occurs because
he doesn't see it as a business.

980
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:30,335
It's not going to change.

981
01:33:30,871 --> 01:33:35,240
So, it is betterto
impIement this proposaI.

982
01:33:35,676 --> 01:33:40,613
An enterprising young man Iike
you can't harp on this oId shop.

983
01:33:41,649 --> 01:33:42,911
We have to be practicaI.

984
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:46,116
If you want to continue with this option,
you have to reach a concIusion very fast.

985
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:47,549
We are not seIIing off the property.

986
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:50,916
Faizi...

987
01:33:51,692 --> 01:33:53,887
PIease give him some more
time to think over this matter.

988
01:33:54,028 --> 01:33:55,620
After taking a decision, just inform me..

989
01:33:55,896 --> 01:33:57,295
I wiII make further arrangements.

990
01:33:57,698 --> 01:33:58,756
Okay. Thank you.

991
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:16,473
Grandpa...

992
01:34:17,418 --> 01:34:18,385
When did you take this Ioan?

993
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:21,384
3 years back.

994
01:34:23,057 --> 01:34:24,820
I didn't have money to run the shop.

995
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:27,625
Money shouId be repaid.

996
01:34:29,397 --> 01:34:30,329
What about the fund for that?

997
01:34:31,932 --> 01:34:32,591
Not with me.

998
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:35,192
Then?

999
01:34:40,541 --> 01:34:41,599
I don't know.

1000
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:47,106
Grandpa...

1001
01:34:48,049 --> 01:34:48,981
Are you aIright?

1002
01:34:51,652 --> 01:34:54,314
Have you seen the rain in a desert?

1003
01:34:57,291 --> 01:34:58,315
I have seen.

1004
01:35:00,428 --> 01:35:02,988
I was on my way to
Moinuddin Chisti dargah.

1005
01:35:04,565 --> 01:35:07,659
Before reaching there
a rain Iike this.

1006
01:35:13,574 --> 01:35:14,973
Then any one wouId be forced to think...

1007
01:35:15,976 --> 01:35:18,342
...the way to heaven
is not so Iong from there.

1008
01:35:40,801 --> 01:35:44,134
Your biriyani is the best in this city.

1009
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:46,231
StiII the business incurs Ioss.

1010
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:47,429
Why is it Iike that?

1011
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:52,271
I don't make any compromise
in the quaIity of the food I cook.

1012
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:53,413
So, the expense wiII be more.

1013
01:35:53,647 --> 01:35:54,807
And you won't hike the price.

1014
01:35:55,049 --> 01:35:55,981
That's not the reason.

1015
01:35:56,517 --> 01:35:59,680
Without hiking the price, I get profit.

1016
01:36:00,354 --> 01:36:03,949
But I have to meet some
other expenses aIso.

1017
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:05,885
The coIIege fees of Ummar's son.

1018
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:08,088
Wedding of Abida's daughter.

1019
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:08,952
Is it not?

1020
01:36:10,464 --> 01:36:14,560
In that way, this hoteI is run to
meet the expenses of others.

1021
01:36:15,236 --> 01:36:16,601
It's not a business for you.

1022
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:25,571
Don't you often say that...

1023
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:29,211
...you wouId Iike to go for Iong journeys
Ieaving behind aII these things?

1024
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:31,748
That you wouId Iike to go to aII darga's.

1025
01:36:33,621 --> 01:36:35,953
Without cIosing the hoteI,
can you do such things?

1026
01:36:36,157 --> 01:36:38,148
I do to the best of my abiIity.

1027
01:36:39,527 --> 01:36:42,860
A boat can't be rowed for
a Iong distance aII aIone.

1028
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:46,964
If there is someone to row with
me........the situation is different.

1029
01:36:51,839 --> 01:36:53,238
The commitment that you
feeI towards the hoteI...

1030
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:55,942
...can't be expected from anyone eIse.

1031
01:36:56,911 --> 01:37:01,610
So, it is better to end this
which was started by you.

1032
01:37:04,985 --> 01:37:06,953
Fate is a fact.

1033
01:37:07,421 --> 01:37:09,446
No one can stop it.

1034
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:11,985
Let's wait and see what wiII happen.

1035
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:16,725
We are the makers
of our own fate, right?

1036
01:37:17,598 --> 01:37:19,862
I'm the person who has to
decide what to do in my Iife.

1037
01:37:20,267 --> 01:37:21,529
Can anyone eIse do that?

1038
01:37:21,635 --> 01:37:23,728
If that is the case, you wouId
not have been with me.

1039
01:37:24,405 --> 01:37:26,430
If you were abIe to
act as you wished...

1040
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:28,531
...you wouId be Iiving
happiIy in London now.

1041
01:37:28,642 --> 01:37:31,702
You wouId not be with the
probIems of an oId man, right?

1042
01:37:33,547 --> 01:37:34,707
This is fate, my son.

1043
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:42,813
Sometimes, I feeI that there is no
point is dreaming about London.

1044
01:37:44,058 --> 01:37:44,615
Have this.

1045
01:37:52,766 --> 01:37:54,028
There is a smaII difference in this?

1046
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:57,095
Cardamom?

1047
01:38:00,608 --> 01:38:03,076
Some other spice?

1048
01:38:04,111 --> 01:38:05,772
I wiII teII you about that ingredient.

1049
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:09,883
But more than that it is
your feeIing in your mind.

1050
01:38:18,826 --> 01:38:22,853
A IittIe bit of Iove shouId be
added with every 'suIaimani'.

1051
01:38:23,364 --> 01:38:27,460
When we have that the whoIe
worId shouId come to a standstiII.

1052
01:39:25,693 --> 01:39:26,216
Grandpa...

1053
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:30,152
CouId you teII me the story of your Iove?

1054
01:39:34,468 --> 01:39:38,234
How come you are very much
sure that I had a Iove affair?.

1055
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:42,603
OnIy those who have tasted a
'suIaimani' can teII about it's taste.

1056
01:39:55,189 --> 01:39:56,986
When I was eighteen years oId.

1057
01:39:57,624 --> 01:39:59,854
The same year I joined with my master.

1058
01:40:01,862 --> 01:40:05,662
For the wedding of MauIavi's
daughter, I went to cook biriyani.

1059
01:40:16,777 --> 01:40:22,010
In between, I saw a
beauty nearthe window.

1060
01:40:22,783 --> 01:40:24,341
Like a caged bird.

1061
01:40:24,618 --> 01:40:30,079
''Didn't you stand near the door
with your rapt attention?''

1062
01:40:30,691 --> 01:40:35,993
''I stood Iike the Iine of
a haIf sung meIody..''

1063
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:42,226
''Didn't you stand near the
door with your rapt attention?''

1064
01:40:42,636 --> 01:40:47,801
''I stood Iike the Iine
of a haIf sung meIody..''

1065
01:40:48,075 --> 01:40:53,980
''Kissing on the red Iips..''

1066
01:40:54,114 --> 01:40:59,814
''Kissing on the red Iips..''

1067
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:03,947
Something started shivering in my heart.

1068
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:09,521
Everything happened in my Iife before
seemed to have converged to that point.

1069
01:41:13,267 --> 01:41:14,199
Who was that?

1070
01:41:16,236 --> 01:41:17,294
MauIavi's daughter.

1071
01:41:19,606 --> 01:41:22,006
I went to cook biriyani
for her wedding onIy.

1072
01:41:36,423 --> 01:41:37,754
Then what happened?

1073
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:39,316
What to happen?

1074
01:41:41,395 --> 01:41:43,454
After wedding and eating your
biriyani, they went away.

1075
01:41:47,167 --> 01:41:48,964
Haven't you faIIen in Iove with anyone?

1076
01:41:49,203 --> 01:41:50,693
I don't have anything of that sort.

1077
01:41:51,138 --> 01:41:51,832
Love!

1078
01:41:57,111 --> 01:42:00,046
''Seeking various ways to see''

1079
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,910
''And when seeing her, cIosed my eyes''

1080
01:42:03,684 --> 01:42:09,213
''My dear, didn't you stand there''

1081
01:42:09,690 --> 01:42:14,593
''Didn't you sIither away shyIy?''

1082
01:42:15,095 --> 01:42:20,761
''Sweet taIks, as a roaring ocean''

1083
01:42:21,068 --> 01:42:26,734
''Sweet taIks, as an incessant rain''

1084
01:42:27,107 --> 01:42:33,012
''Like a peacock, Iife
was fuII of pIayfuIness''

1085
01:42:33,847 --> 01:42:36,577
Any way you haven't given up
that beauty from your heart.

1086
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:39,679
Faizi son..

1087
01:42:39,953 --> 01:42:40,647
What's the matter?

1088
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:44,547
Do you know who that beauty is?

1089
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,218
Your grand mother.

1090
01:42:47,361 --> 01:42:51,229
''Didn't you stand near the
door with your rapt attention?''

1091
01:42:51,732 --> 01:42:56,931
''I stood Iike the Iine
of a haIf sung meIody..''

1092
01:42:57,604 --> 01:43:03,406
''Didn't you stand near the
door with your rapt attention?''

1093
01:43:03,644 --> 01:43:09,014
''I stood Iike the Iine
of a haIf sung meIody..''

1094
01:43:45,619 --> 01:43:46,313
Faizi...

1095
01:43:46,787 --> 01:43:48,277
We have become friends.

1096
01:43:50,657 --> 01:43:52,022
You smart guy..

1097
01:44:13,447 --> 01:44:14,607
Mehroof is an idiot.

1098
01:44:17,217 --> 01:44:18,878
His snobbish nature...

1099
01:44:19,519 --> 01:44:20,816
So insensitive.

1100
01:44:24,157 --> 01:44:26,682
He doesn't care about how others feeI.

1101
01:44:27,527 --> 01:44:29,188
Is it because of that
you joined with him?

1102
01:44:30,831 --> 01:44:31,798
Perfect pair!

1103
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:39,432
I made a mistake.

1104
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:41,104
Don't say that.

1105
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:45,002
Any way you are
going to marry him, right?

1106
01:44:46,346 --> 01:44:48,007
I didn't mention about Mehroof.

1107
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:51,008
About you.

1108
01:45:08,168 --> 01:45:10,227
Time up for bIack tea.

1109
01:45:11,371 --> 01:45:12,633
This is not bad.

1110
01:45:13,373 --> 01:45:15,432
He is repeating history.

1111
01:45:16,276 --> 01:45:17,140
How?

1112
01:45:19,212 --> 01:45:21,476
SteaIing another one's bride.

1113
01:45:33,393 --> 01:45:34,417
Okay. Good Iuck.

1114
01:45:34,594 --> 01:45:35,390
Thank you very much.

1115
01:45:36,763 --> 01:45:37,422
Wait wait

1116
01:45:38,165 --> 01:45:39,496
I want a picture of you.
- Sure.

1117
01:45:41,635 --> 01:45:42,727
Make sure you don't forget me.

1118
01:45:43,637 --> 01:45:45,036
I remember what you said.

1119
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:49,001
If there is any job opportunity in
Paris, I wiII make sure you get it.

1120
01:45:49,142 --> 01:45:51,007
Thank you chef.
It was great working with you.

1121
01:45:55,615 --> 01:45:57,173
Just one of mine.
- Yes. No probIem.

1122
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:42,784
Hey George, how are you?

1123
01:46:43,797 --> 01:46:44,525
Yes, teII me.

1124
01:46:45,866 --> 01:46:46,457
Why?

1125
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:49,532
Okay, I wiII be there.

1126
01:47:41,154 --> 01:47:42,280
I don't understand anything.

1127
01:47:42,956 --> 01:47:45,117
You must be famiIiar with these things.

1128
01:47:51,064 --> 01:47:53,658
This is the fIoor pIans of
Beach Bay InternationaI.

1129
01:47:56,603 --> 01:47:57,535
That's strange.

1130
01:47:58,839 --> 01:47:59,533
See this.

1131
01:48:04,845 --> 01:48:08,212
In this bIue print we can see the
expansion pIans of Beach Bay.

1132
01:48:09,049 --> 01:48:11,040
The main extension
is towards the beach.

1133
01:48:12,052 --> 01:48:14,680
But the reaI boundary is here.

1134
01:48:15,856 --> 01:48:19,223
This new expansion area is
near to your promenade.

1135
01:48:19,993 --> 01:48:21,017
That means nearby grandpa's hoteI.

1136
01:48:21,461 --> 01:48:25,397
ActuaIIy grandpa's house and
hoteI are incIuded in this pIan.

1137
01:48:30,871 --> 01:48:34,238
That means, Beach
Bay is behind the bank.

1138
01:48:37,110 --> 01:48:38,975
That's why they are pushing the proposaI.

1139
01:48:46,386 --> 01:48:49,913
Our worId has been shrunk
into a smaII corner of their pIan.

1140
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,493
I have to somehow repay the Ioan.

1141
01:49:03,803 --> 01:49:06,294
I don't think that they
wiII Iet you repay that.

1142
01:49:24,991 --> 01:49:25,616
Good morning sir.

1143
01:49:27,027 --> 01:49:29,689
If you have time to spare,
waiting to see you.

1144
01:49:30,230 --> 01:49:30,753
Okay.

1145
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:32,728
Sir, I am FaizaI AbduI Razaq.
- Faizi, right?

1146
01:49:33,166 --> 01:49:33,723
Yes sir.

1147
01:49:36,469 --> 01:49:37,561
That's very kind of him sir.

1148
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:44,069
I have come to taIk a matter
which is not reIated to my job here.

1149
01:49:45,245 --> 01:49:48,408
It's none of my business..
but I feIt Iike teIIing you this.

1150
01:49:48,748 --> 01:49:49,305
Go on.

1151
01:49:51,585 --> 01:49:56,147
The nearby ustad hoteI,
is owned by my grandpa.

1152
01:49:58,558 --> 01:50:00,116
Now he has some financiaI probIems.

1153
01:50:01,161 --> 01:50:05,291
I came to know that Beach Bay
Int. is interested in that property.

1154
01:50:18,411 --> 01:50:20,641
I don't know what that
bank manager toId you.

1155
01:50:21,448 --> 01:50:24,383
But for my grandpa
it is notjust a property.

1156
01:50:26,186 --> 01:50:28,746
So, he has no pIans to seII it.

1157
01:50:31,591 --> 01:50:36,324
So I hope, Beach Bay Int. can
change it's pIan accordingIy.

1158
01:50:50,944 --> 01:50:51,968
What Faizi said is right.

1159
01:50:53,747 --> 01:50:54,805
This is not your business.

1160
01:50:56,850 --> 01:50:59,614
Our pIans are not to be changed
according to someone eIse's interests.

1161
01:51:00,453 --> 01:51:03,013
Often others change
according to our interests.

1162
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:06,424
Otherwise they themseIves wiII
have to face its consequences.

1163
01:51:07,127 --> 01:51:09,925
I hope your grandpa understands that.

1164
01:51:12,065 --> 01:51:13,259
An oId biriyani shop!

1165
01:51:13,867 --> 01:51:16,836
To cIose it down, just one
phone caII shouId be enough.

1166
01:51:18,271 --> 01:51:21,502
Go..there wiII be something
to be chopped in the kitchen.

1167
01:51:44,831 --> 01:51:47,061
How dare you give
us something Iike this?

1168
01:51:49,235 --> 01:51:49,929
What's this?

1169
01:51:50,003 --> 01:51:51,061
The chicken is not fresh.

1170
01:51:51,171 --> 01:51:52,570
Is this kind of chicken you
are serving to my guests?

1171
01:51:52,672 --> 01:51:54,537
Sorry sir.
- Go, caII the chef.

1172
01:51:54,974 --> 01:51:55,804
Yes sir
- Bring him here.

1173
01:51:57,577 --> 01:51:58,202
Chef...

1174
01:51:59,579 --> 01:52:00,876
GM's guest is caIIing you.

1175
01:52:01,414 --> 01:52:03,575
He gave me a pasting because
of that stuffed chicken dish.

1176
01:52:04,150 --> 01:52:04,775
What's the compIaint?

1177
01:52:04,884 --> 01:52:06,078
They compIain that the
chicken is not fresh.

1178
01:52:13,460 --> 01:52:14,324
This is fresh.

1179
01:52:14,494 --> 01:52:15,119
Chef...

1180
01:52:16,663 --> 01:52:18,961
GM's guests need fresh chicken, right?

1181
01:52:28,775 --> 01:52:30,606
A fresher chicken wiII Iook Iike this.

1182
01:53:07,747 --> 01:53:09,305
We are from the food and
drug administration office.

1183
01:53:09,616 --> 01:53:11,948
We have received information
about your restaurant hygiene.

1184
01:53:12,919 --> 01:53:14,113
I didn't understand.

1185
01:53:14,454 --> 01:53:16,854
That we have received a compIaint
regarding the hygiene of this hoteI.

1186
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:28,793
You sit there.

1187
01:54:04,537 --> 01:54:05,731
Send the customers out.

1188
01:54:06,606 --> 01:54:07,800
We are seaIing this shop.

1189
01:54:09,375 --> 01:54:10,239
For what?

1190
01:54:10,543 --> 01:54:12,670
A cat is Iying dead in your kitchen.

1191
01:54:42,242 --> 01:54:43,504
LegaI action for seven days.

1192
01:54:44,644 --> 01:54:47,875
Afterthat there wiII be an inspection
before they couId open the hoteI.

1193
01:54:49,148 --> 01:54:51,639
The rest you can enquire in our office.

1194
01:55:10,169 --> 01:55:13,229
Raid in Ustad hoteI near the
Kozhicode beach.

1195
01:55:14,507 --> 01:55:17,806
Because of unhygienic conditions in
which the hoteI was working, the...

1196
01:55:17,911 --> 01:55:20,937
...food controI and drug administration
department has seaIed the hoteI.

1197
01:55:50,843 --> 01:55:53,676
Raid in Ustad hoteI near
the Kozhicode beach.

1198
01:55:53,746 --> 01:55:56,772
Because of unhygienic conditions in
which the hoteI was working, the...

1199
01:55:56,916 --> 01:55:59,783
...food controI and drug administration
department has seaIed the hoteI.

1200
01:56:01,921 --> 01:56:05,049
Common man aIways faII
prey to commerciaIization.

1201
01:56:05,258 --> 01:56:08,056
Even though peopIe had compIained
against the hoteI severaI times...

1202
01:56:08,194 --> 01:56:10,822
...the authorities had
not taken any action.

1203
01:56:10,930 --> 01:56:13,262
We see here the ire of the peopIe.

1204
01:56:15,101 --> 01:56:18,070
For BCV, with camera man
Praveen, Tony.

1205
01:56:24,444 --> 01:56:25,206
Move aside.

1206
01:56:28,247 --> 01:56:28,872
Faizi...

1207
01:56:29,949 --> 01:56:31,382
Go away with aII these.

1208
01:56:32,385 --> 01:56:33,079
Move.

1209
01:56:33,686 --> 01:56:34,311
Leave me.

1210
01:56:35,455 --> 01:56:36,717
Why are you just gaping at?

1211
01:56:36,990 --> 01:56:37,752
Make him move.

1212
01:56:38,524 --> 01:56:39,183
Faizi...

1213
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:41,190
No son.

1214
01:56:49,435 --> 01:56:50,424
Beat him.

1215
01:56:51,671 --> 01:56:53,662
Don't Iet him go.

1216
01:57:08,421 --> 01:57:11,549
WhiIe reporting, the
hoteI authorities beat up...

1217
01:57:11,657 --> 01:57:14,125
...the BTV reporter and the camera man.

1218
01:57:14,227 --> 01:57:16,787
They were admitted to
hospitaI with minor injuries.

1219
01:57:19,565 --> 01:57:21,362
What you said is right, my son.

1220
01:57:22,201 --> 01:57:23,725
Time up to cIose down.

1221
01:57:24,904 --> 01:57:25,734
No grandpa.

1222
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:28,237
It is high time we taught them a Iesson.

1223
01:57:28,875 --> 01:57:29,739
No need.

1224
01:57:30,176 --> 01:57:32,201
Now, no need to do anything Iike that.

1225
01:57:32,512 --> 01:57:34,207
Our condition is not suitabIe for that.

1226
01:57:34,614 --> 01:57:37,174
We can't fight against them.

1227
01:57:37,517 --> 01:57:39,417
These poorfoIks wiII aIso suffer with us.

1228
01:57:40,253 --> 01:57:41,777
You shouId not taIk Iike that.

1229
01:57:41,888 --> 01:57:44,322
We are aII sons of this same soiI.

1230
01:57:44,457 --> 01:57:47,017
We need not fear the new entrants.

1231
01:57:47,160 --> 01:57:48,923
We can aIso do something.

1232
01:57:49,095 --> 01:57:50,858
Faizi, we are with you.

1233
01:57:51,197 --> 01:57:53,028
Why shouId we fearthem?

1234
01:57:53,199 --> 01:57:54,928
No one wiII Iose
anything because of this.

1235
01:57:55,368 --> 01:57:57,131
We have to open the hoteI at any cost.

cIosed down some days ago.

1266

There has been any

1271
02:03:18,157 --> 02:03:19,818
Ustad hoteI must be reopened.

Grandpa!

1293
02:05:52,811 --> 02:05:53,675
Everything okay.

What you said is right.

1295
02:05:56,515 --> 02:05:57,573
Regarding fate.

1296
02:05:59,218 --> 02:06:01,345
Chef PhiIip opens a

1297
02:06:02,555 --> 02:06:03,749
He asks me to go with him.

1298
02:06:04,890 --> 02:06:06,118
As an executive chef.

1299
02:06:13,933 --> 02:06:15,833
I got the resuIt for aII my hard work.

1300
02:06:17,202 --> 02:06:17,725
Grandpa...

1301
02:06:18,070 --> 02:06:20,402
You shouId get my
passport from my father.

1302
02:06:21,240 --> 02:06:23,105
If I get that, I can fIy.

1303
02:06:23,943 --> 02:06:24,910
I can fIy high.

1304
02:06:31,283 --> 02:06:32,944
I won't get another chance Iike this.

1305
02:06:34,620 --> 02:06:37,214
I wiII be back after making a
caII to my sister..one minute.

1306
02:07:23,302 --> 02:07:24,360
It was a miId attack.

1307
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:25,767
He needs rest for some more days.

1308
02:07:34,446 --> 02:07:37,074
ReIax..his condition is stabIe now.

1309

I have anothertension now.

1310
02:07:42,688 --> 02:07:44,815
He shouId not teII me to remain here.

1311

Right time for an
emotionaI bIack maiIing.

1312
02:07:52,264 --> 02:07:53,697
Even if he asks, you
have the option to go.

1313
02:08:25,164 --> 02:08:29,157
WiII you do a favor to
me before you Ieave?

1314
02:08:30,469 --> 02:08:31,060
Sure.

1320
02:08:50,889 --> 02:08:51,514
Grandpa...

1321
02:08:52,558 --> 02:08:54,150
When you are in the hospitaI, I.....

1322
02:08:58,530 --> 02:09:01,931
Those who want to go have to
go irrespective of the situations.

1323
02:10:37,830 --> 02:10:38,489
Excuse-me.

1324
02:10:40,499 --> 02:10:41,625
Mr. Narayan Krishnan?

1325
02:10:42,134 --> 02:10:42,793
- Yes.

1326
02:10:43,669 --> 02:10:45,432
I have been sent by
Karim ikka from CaIicut.

1327
02:10:49,975 --> 02:10:51,306
How is he?

1328
02:10:52,344 --> 02:10:53,072
He is fine.

1329
02:10:54,146 --> 02:10:55,977
He is in hospitaI.

1330
02:10:57,950 --> 02:10:58,780
He had a heart attack.

1331
02:11:00,586 --> 02:11:01,314
But he is fine now.

1332
02:11:02,988 --> 02:11:04,285
He has given me a Ietter for you.

1333
02:11:10,896 --> 02:11:12,488
Dear Narayan Krishnan.

1334
02:11:13,866 --> 02:11:17,734
It is my grand chiId who
meets you with this Ietter.

1335
02:11:19,738 --> 02:11:23,071
I teach him how to cook.

1336
02:11:23,609 --> 02:11:28,672
But you have to teach
him for what we cooking for?

1337
02:11:58,377 --> 02:11:58,968
Faizi...

1338
02:12:01,146 --> 02:12:01,771
You too come with us.

1339
02:12:02,314 --> 02:12:02,803
Okay.

1340
02:12:24,670 --> 02:12:25,694
Why she is crying?

1341
02:12:37,516 --> 02:12:38,608
Give it to them.

1342
02:12:40,652 --> 02:12:41,311
You eat.

1343
02:12:44,323 --> 02:12:45,255
Good boy, right?

1344
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:47,380
Eat sIowIy.

1345
02:12:49,094 --> 02:12:50,823
Do you Iike idIi?

1346
02:13:09,047 --> 02:13:10,776
Are you working in ustad hoteI?

1347
02:13:11,650 --> 02:13:12,207
No.

1348
02:13:12,851 --> 02:13:13,579
I am a chef.

1349
02:13:14,186 --> 02:13:15,517
I'm going to France soon.

1350
02:13:15,887 --> 02:13:16,785
I've got a job there.

1351
02:13:19,925 --> 02:13:20,892
Executive chef!

1352
02:13:22,327 --> 02:13:23,885
I was a chef in Taj.

1353
02:13:24,196 --> 02:13:25,060
Some years back.

1354
02:13:26,164 --> 02:13:27,358
I work theirfor 12 years.

1355
02:13:30,135 --> 02:13:31,295
You see that oId man.

1356
02:13:37,075 --> 02:13:38,337
He change my Iife.

1357
02:13:55,027 --> 02:13:56,585
That time I was working in Taj.

1358
02:14:01,700 --> 02:14:03,395
I saw this man that
day for the first time.

1359
02:14:06,338 --> 02:14:10,240
UnabIe to endure appetite, he
was eating his own human waste.

1360
02:14:26,358 --> 02:14:29,350
Then I thought - what is
the purpose of my Iife?

1361
02:14:30,429 --> 02:14:33,125
I am working in a star hoteI,
feeding aII my guest.

1362
02:14:34,266 --> 02:14:35,528
And in my native pIace...

1363
02:14:36,201 --> 02:14:40,501
...peopIe without means to
have food for at Ieast once a day.

1364
02:15:10,535 --> 02:15:11,627
I quit the job.

1365
02:15:12,938 --> 02:15:14,929
And started this.

1366
02:15:55,947 --> 02:15:57,505
NormaIIy human beings are
never satisfied with anything.

1367
02:15:58,216 --> 02:15:59,683
They wiII demand for more.

1368
02:16:00,785 --> 02:16:02,218
But in the case of food, it is different.

1369
02:16:03,155 --> 02:16:05,282
If one's stomach is fuII, one
have to say it is enough.

1370
02:16:31,983 --> 02:16:33,245
Wake up man.

1371
02:16:33,919 --> 02:16:36,251
Wake up, wake up sIowIy.

1372
02:16:36,755 --> 02:16:39,883
We have to go to HeIIen KeIIer
schooI at Nerimaid on noon.

1373
02:16:40,158 --> 02:16:42,991
Every one get ready
by 8'O cIock. - Okay?

1374
02:16:43,662 --> 02:16:44,424
Understood?

1375
02:16:46,498 --> 02:16:47,487
Faizi...

1376
02:16:49,701 --> 02:16:50,827
You do one thing.

1377
02:16:51,736 --> 02:16:53,203
Today you cook the food.

1378
02:16:53,338 --> 02:16:54,362
- Okay.

1379
02:16:54,573 --> 02:16:56,336
I mean, sure.

1380
02:16:58,376 --> 02:16:59,809
Sir... - Yes?

1381
02:17:01,313 --> 02:17:02,405
What shouId I cook?

1382
02:17:03,715 --> 02:17:05,876
Nothing eIse, but 'Biriyani'.

1383
02:17:06,284 --> 02:17:07,546
Karim ikka's biriyani.

1384
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:35,029
Faizi...

1385
02:19:35,667 --> 02:19:36,895
Is it is that much good?

1386
02:19:37,902 --> 02:19:40,029
Then I wiII eat check? - PIease.

1387
02:19:52,283 --> 02:19:52,977
Faizi...

1388
02:19:55,487 --> 02:19:57,955
As I know this is the
best 'Biriyani' that you made.

1389
02:19:58,423 --> 02:19:59,685
It is reaIIy tasty.

1390
02:21:41,159 --> 02:21:44,094
They are saying thanks
in there sign Ianguage.

1391
02:22:00,812 --> 02:22:01,642
Son...

1392
02:22:02,146 --> 02:22:04,205
Any one can give food for others.

1393
02:22:04,883 --> 02:22:07,750
But we have to satisfy their mind aIso.

1394
02:22:08,019 --> 02:22:10,180
That is the reaI Midas touch in cooking.

1395
02:23:00,805 --> 02:23:02,500
Ustad hoteI cIosed.

1396
02:23:12,850 --> 02:23:13,509
Grandpa?

1397
02:23:14,886 --> 02:23:16,012
He has Ieft us.

1398
02:23:19,057 --> 02:23:19,955
What has he got to Iose?

1399
02:23:20,758 --> 02:23:22,521
He wiII wander around with
a satcheI on his shouIder

1400
02:23:23,661 --> 02:23:25,060
He is quite used to that.

1401
02:23:26,831 --> 02:23:29,163
But we Iost everything.

1402
02:24:35,166 --> 02:24:35,655
Here it is.

1403
02:24:58,589 --> 02:24:59,078
Come.

1404
02:25:03,261 --> 02:25:06,958
Thus Ustad hoteI
became as we see now.

1405
02:25:09,200 --> 02:25:09,859
Is it not enough?

1406
02:25:10,134 --> 02:25:11,726
I'm quite tired describing the story.

1407
02:25:12,270 --> 02:25:13,601
Thank you. Ummar ikka.

1408
02:25:14,338 --> 02:25:14,929
Didn't you hear?

1409
02:25:15,473 --> 02:25:19,136
We have heard the history of
ustad hoteI which is 60 years Iong.

1410
02:25:19,377 --> 02:25:21,277
This is notjust history, but a story too.

1411
02:25:21,446 --> 02:25:24,882
We have reached here
in a IoveIy evening.

1412
02:25:25,149 --> 02:25:26,878
Enchanting Sufi dance.

1413
02:25:27,151 --> 02:25:31,178
GazaI..peopIe are watching
this with enthusiasticaIIy.

1414
02:25:31,723 --> 02:25:35,159
The aroma of the biriyani
here is very famous.

1415
02:25:35,493 --> 02:25:37,654
When the Iid of biriyani
vesseI is opened here...

1416
02:25:37,762 --> 02:25:40,060
...it is said that the aroma wiII
reach up to Kozhicode market.

1417
02:25:40,164 --> 02:25:43,327
Karim ikka's midas touch in
cooking is the reason forthat.

1418
02:25:45,203 --> 02:25:48,400
We have with us a
very important person.

1419
02:25:48,606 --> 02:25:51,473
The Iink that connects the
past and present of this hoteI.

1420
02:25:51,609 --> 02:25:55,272
Faizi's father, Karim ikka's
son, Janab AbduI Razak.

1421
02:25:55,747 --> 02:25:58,807
What are aII your memories
about ustad hoteI?

1422
02:25:59,150 --> 02:26:03,348
If I say about memories, this hoteI
was everything for my father.

1423
02:26:03,855 --> 02:26:05,789
I grew up inside this.

1424
02:26:06,557 --> 02:26:10,220
When I was young,
I used to run errands.

1425
02:26:10,361 --> 02:26:12,829
He made Faizi aIso to do the same.

1426
02:26:13,164 --> 02:26:14,529
That's his nature.

1427
02:26:14,899 --> 02:26:17,424
Now, another branch of ustad
hoteI has started in Dubai aIso.

1428
02:26:18,102 --> 02:26:19,626
His sisters run that.

1429
02:26:20,738 --> 02:26:24,697
By God's grace, everything is going
on weII because of his hard work.

1430
02:26:24,942 --> 02:26:25,966
God's grace.

1431
02:26:26,644 --> 02:26:30,341
He is Faizi, who beIongs
to the third generation.

1432
02:26:30,748 --> 02:26:33,114
That means, Ustad's grand son.

1433
02:26:33,885 --> 02:26:36,285
Is this the 'suIaimani' story
toId by Ummar ikka?

1434
02:26:36,521 --> 02:26:37,545
- Yes. Shahana.

1435
02:26:37,922 --> 02:26:42,416
The biriyani in ustad hoteI
is notjust about taste.

1436
02:26:42,660 --> 02:26:44,184
It's aIso the Iove served aIong with that.

1437
02:26:44,929 --> 02:26:47,955
How aII these are
restored as in the past?

1438
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:51,332
We foIIow the same path
shown by grandpa.

1439
02:26:52,470 --> 02:26:54,062
We foIIow the same recipes.

1440
02:26:54,839 --> 02:26:57,933
The success can onIy be attributed
to the originaI team of my grandpa.

1441
02:26:59,477 --> 02:27:04,244
The onIy sad part of the whoIe story is
that grandpa is not here to see aII these.
